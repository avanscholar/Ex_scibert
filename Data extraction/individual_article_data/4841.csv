0,Introduction,"Microalgae have attracted wide attention because they exhibit high growth rates on sites that are unsuitable for agriculture, thus avoiding undesirable competition with food crops. They produce various nutrients and can be used in various applications such as supplements, drugs, and cosmetics. In addition, they are known to produce and store lipids with much higher productivity than conventional plant crops [1]. Therefore, microalgae-derived renewable fuels are expected as potential sources to replace fossil fuels and development of their efficient conversion technology is necessary. Euglena gracilis is one of such promising microalgae and mass cultivation of it in an open pond has been achieved recently [2]. Euglena gracilis synthesizes wax esters (WEs) from paramylon, a Euglena specific polysaccharides, when it is brought from aerobic to anaerobic conditions [3], and the lipid yields can reach 50% of cellular dry weight [3,4]. WEs are esters composed of saturated fatty acids and fatty alcohols. The accumulation of WEs is unique to Euglena because most other microalgae store lipids as triglycerides (TGs), which are esters composed of glycerol and saturated or unsaturated fatty acids. Euglena is also unique in that it has a simple cell structure without cell walls, and therefore accumulated WEs can be extracted easily without requiring energy-consuming disruption of tough cell walls [5,6]. To use WEs as transportation fuels, they can be converted to biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters; FAMEs) by a transesterification process [7,8]. However, the biodiesel is an oxygen-containing fuel, whose heat value is low and thermal and oxidation stabilities are poor. To improve the heat value and stabilities, deoxygenation of WEs and their conversion to hydrocarbons are important. The deoxygenation of WEs is usually performed using a hydrotreating process [9], but using pressurized hydrogen atmosphere incurs high operation costs. These are common problems with the utilization of TGs as transportation fuels. In contrast, a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process can convert TGs to hydrocarbons under a hydrogen-free atmosphere [10–14]. FCC process is one of the major oil refining technologies that processes feedstocks such as heavy gas oil, vacuum gas oil and atmospheric residue. Typical FCC catalysts consist of zeolite (ultra-stable Y (USY) partly exchanged with rare earth (RE) ions), filler (kaolin clay) and matrix (meso- and macroporous silica or alumina) [15]. The heavy oil feedstocks are converted to high-octane gasoline blend, light olefins (propylene and butene), heavy liquid hydrocarbons (light cycle oil; LCO), and coke during cracking, isomerization, cyclization and hydrogen transfer reactions on the acid sites of the USY zeolite. The coke deposited on the catalysts are burned off in the regenerator and the regenerated catalysts are re-used continuously. In addition to these reactions, deoxygenation reaction proceeds in TG cracking and produces H2O, CO2 and CO. In particular, we recently found that enhancing the hydrogen-transfer activity in the FCC process is effective for removing oxygens in TGs as H2O [16]. The formation of H2O rather than CO2 and CO is an efficient reaction because all the carbon resources contained in TGs can be converted to hydrocarbons without carbon loss. Therefore, the FCC with enhanced hydrogen-transfer activity is considered to be a promising process for alternative fuel production. However, the catalytic cracking of WEs has, insofar as we are aware, not been reported. In this study, we therefore investigated the deoxygenation of WEs in a catalytic cracking process and compared their reaction with that of TGs."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials An equilibrium catalyst (E-cat), which was obtained from a commercial residue FCC (RFCC) unit, was used for all the catalytic cracking experiments. The RFCC E-cat is known to exhibit strong hydrogen transfer activity because its hydrothermal stability in the reactor-regenerator cycle was enhanced by the high RE loading on the USY zeolite. The effect of RE loading on the catalyst stability and hydrogen transfer activity has been discussed in the literature [17–20]. The Euglena WE, which was extracted from Euglena gracilis, was purified and supplied by euglena Co., Ltd. The composition of fatty acids and fatty alcohols of the Euglena WE was analyzed using the method reported by Inui et al. [4] and Ichihara and Fukubayashi [21]. WEs were converted to FAMEs and fatty alcohols, which were analyzed using a gas chromatography (GC) system (GC-390B, GL Sciences Inc., Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) using He as a carrier gas. The packed columns used for fractionating FAMEs and fatty alcohols were a 3 m-length Unisole 3000 coated on Uniport C 80/100 (GL Sciences Inc.) and a 1 m-length PEG-HT coated on Uniport HP 60/80 (GL Sciences Inc.), respectively. As shown in Table 1 , the Euglena WE mainly consisted of myristyl myristate. In addition, coconut oil (Kaneda Shoji Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and sunflower oil (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) were also used as reactants. Both coconut and sunflower oil consist of TGs, but their fatty acid composition is different. Coconut oil consists mainly of saturated C12 and C14 fatty acids (46.9 mol% and 15.7 mol%, respectively), whereas sunflower oil consists mainly of C18 unsaturated fatty acids (88.5 mol%). The detailed fatty acid compositions of the two plant oils were reported previously [16]."
3,Catalytic activity tests,"2.2 Catalytic activity tests Catalytic activity tests were conducted in a fixed-bed microactivity test reactor, details of which were given in a previous publication [22]. In each trial, E-cat (1.9–5.3 g) was placed in the reactor, which was maintained at 470 °C. The feedstock (Euglena WE, coconut oil and sunflower oil) was fed into the reactor using a microfeeder while being heated electrically in a preheating line. The feed injection time was 75 s and the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) was varied between 12 and 33 h−1. For these conditions, the weight ratio of the catalyst to the oil (cat/oil) was in the range of 1.5–4.0. N2 gas was added during feed injection at 19 mL min−1. After each test, the catalyst was stripped by purging with N2 gas at 5 mL min−1 for 15 min. During the reaction and stripping stages, the liquid products were collected in a cold trap with two receiving vessels connected in series and maintained at 0 and -15 °C, respectively. Simultaneously, the gaseous products were collected in a gas burette by displacement of a saturated NaCl solution. For all experiments, a mass balance across the collected products was found to be in the range of 92–104 wt% of the process inputs. The amounts of H2, N2, CO2 and CO in the gaseous products were determined using a GC system (GC-8A, Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a packed column (SHINCARBON-ST 50/80, Shinwa Chemical Industries, Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) with Ar as the carrier gas. Hydrocarbons and oxygenates were analyzed with another GC system (GC-2014, Shimadzu Corp.) fitted with a capillary column (BP1, SGE Analytical Science Pty. Ltd., Victoria, Australia) and FID with He as the carrier gas. Biphenyl (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) was used as the internal standard in the GC-FID assay. Quantification of the hydrocarbons and oxygenates was based on the effective carbon number theory [23]. The amount of coke deposited on the catalyst was determined from the difference between the mass of the reactor before and after testing. Three hydrocarbon fractions were defined based on carbon number or boiling point thresholds: gaseous hydrocarbons (C1 − C4); gasoline (C5 – 216 °C) and LCO (216 °C –). In addition, jet fuel fraction was defined as carbon number range of C10 − C15."
4,Results,
5,Reaction products of WE cracking,"3.1 Reaction products of WE cracking The reaction product yields from the catalytic cracking of Euglena WE are shown in Fig. 1 and compared with those from coconut oil (saturated TG) and sunflower oil (unsaturated TG), which were investigated in our previous study [16]. Hydrocarbons, which are represented in the figure as gaseous hydrocarbons, gasoline and LCO, were the main reaction products in all the experiments, whereas CO2, CO and some oxygenates such as fatty acids, ketones, aldehydes, and esters were also detected. Water droplets were visible in the liquid products from all feedstocks, but they were not quantified. The “unknown” yield in Fig. 1 therefore contains both water and large-molecule products that were not detected by GC-FID because of their high boiling points. The hydrocarbon yield from Euglena WE was higher than that from coconut oil but lower than that from sunflower oil. The high hydrocarbon yield from sunflower oil is due to the high reactivity of unsaturated bonds in the catalytic cracking reaction; they are rapidly converted to carbenium ions on the Brønsted acid sites [24] and the carbenium ions are key intermediates for both decomposition and deoxygenation [16]. Among the saturated feedstocks, Euglena WE showed higher hydrocarbon yields and lower oxygenate yields than coconut oil did, which indicates that deoxygenation of Euglena WE proceeded more rapidly than that of coconut oil. This can be attributed to the difference in the molecular structure. Table 2 shows the yields of oxygen-containing species. The catalytic cracking of Euglena WE produced lower CO2 and CO yields (oxygen base) than that of coconut oil despite the progress of deoxygenation. This result suggests that the deoxygenation of Euglena WE was accompanied by H2O formation rather than CO2 and CO. The deoxygenation pathway producing H2O instead of CO2 or CO is efficient because it can suppress the carbon loss in the conversion of biomass resources to hydrocarbons. Fig. 2 shows the hydrocarbon yields and their composition in gaseous, gasoline, jet fuel and LCO fraction from the catalytic cracking of three feedstocks. The saturated feedstocks (Euglena WE and coconut oil) produced much gaseous olefins such as propylene and butene, which can be used as chemical feedstocks. In contrast, the catalytic cracking of sunflower oil produced more gaseous paraffins (propane and butane) than gaseous olefins. The butane/butene ratio in the catalytic cracking of each feedstock was 0.8, 1.1 and 2.4 for Euglena WE, coconut oil and sunflower oil, respectively. Because the butane/butene ratio is an index of hydrogen-transfer reaction activity [25], the result indicates the high activity of the hydrogen-transfer reaction in the catalytic cracking of sunflower oil. In this case, the hydrogen donors may be olefins and naphthenes that were produced from the cracking of unsaturated carbon chains in sunflower oil. These hydrogen donors can release hydrogen species by cyclization and aromatization reaction. Then, the released hydrogen species are received by light olefins (hydrogen acceptors) to produce light paraffins. In contrast, the hydrogen-transfer reaction activity of saturated feedstocks was confirmed not to be so strong, which is because production of hydrogen donor is not so active. The gasoline fraction produced from the saturated feedstocks (Euglena WE and coconut oil) contained a large proportion of olefins, whereas that from sunflower oil contained a large proportion of aromatics. The low olefin yield from sunflower oil cracking can be explained by the strong activity of the hydrogen-transfer reaction; the olefins in the gasoline fraction were converted to paraffins and aromatics, which results in the lower octane rate of the produced gasoline. In contrast, olefins in the gasoline fraction produced from WE cracking were not converted because of the relatively low activity of the hydrogen-transfer reaction and therefore the octane rate of the gasoline produced from the WE cracking becomes high. The light olefins in gasoline fraction can also be used as chemical feedstocks. A similar trend was observed in the composition of the jet fuel and LCO fractions. Although the jet fuel and LCO fraction yields were the highest in the cracking of sunflower oil, their composition was dominated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which have poor combustion properties and are characterized as soot and smoke producers [26]. Indeed, the aromatic content in aviation fuel is limited to less than 25% (ASTM D-1655). In contrast, the catalytic cracking of saturated feedstocks produced jet fuels and LCO containing a large proportion of paraffins and olefins. Particularly, jet fuel fraction produced from Euglena WE contained a large proportion of iso-paraffins, which are desirable for jet fuel because of their good combustion and cold temperature properties [27–29]. The olefins and aromatics in jet fuel and LCO fractions can be converted to aviation and diesel fuels by hydrogenation processes although the hydrogenation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons consumes large amount of hydrogen. In contrast, the hydrogenation of olefins requires less hydrogen consumption. The reason for the high yield of paraffins in the jet fuel and LCO fractions from Euglena WE can be inferred by the detailed composition of the produced hydrocarbons, which is shown in Fig. 3 . The yields of the paraffins and olefins with carbon numbers 13 and 14 were remarkably higher than those of the neighboring carbon numbers. As shown in Table 1, Euglena WE consists mainly of C14 fatty acid and C14 fatty alcohol. The composition of the reaction products from Euglena WE therefore probably reflected the fatty acid and fatty alcohol that the reactant consisted of. This is the reason for the high yield of jet-fuel and LCO fraction paraffins from Euglena WE cracking, indicating that Euglena WE is suitable as a feedstock for aviation and diesel fuels. The formation of hydrocarbons reflecting the fatty acid and fatty alcohol composition of the reactant is a result of the decomposition of the ester bonds between the fatty acids and the fatty alcohols. This suggests that in the catalytic cracking of Euglena WE, ester bond decomposition is faster than the cracking of saturated carbon chains of the fatty acids and fatty alcohols, which is coincident with the observation of the catalytic cracking of saturated TGs [16]. In contrast, unsaturated carbon chains in sunflower oil were cracked rapidly and converted to gasoline-fraction olefins and naphthenes, thus the paraffins and olefins in the jet fuel and LCO fractions were hardly produced. The excess cyclization, aromatization and condensation of the gasoline-fraction olefins and naphthenes produced from sunflower oil cracking resulted in the formation of polyaromatics. Consequently, the saturated feedstocks produced hydrocarbons with the composition suitable for fuel application (gasoline, jet and diesel fuel) in contrast to the unsaturated feedstocks, which did not. Among the saturated feedstocks, deoxygenation of Euglena WE proceeded more rapidly and efficiently (less carbon loss) than that of coconut oil. Thus, it was confirmed that Euglena WE is more preferable for the feedstock of the FCC process for producing hydrocarbon fuels than TGs."
6,Effect of residence time,"3.2 Effect of residence time To clarify the reaction mechanism of the WE cracking, the reaction products with different residence times were investigated and are shown in Fig. 4 . The hydrocarbons, CO2, CO and coke yields increased as residence time is extended. This relation reflects involvement of the deoxygenation reaction. The oxygen-containing products such as fatty acids, ketones, aldehydes and esters, which were detected with short residence times, became undetectable after a sufficient residence time. Among these oxygenates, the aldehydes yield was the highest. This result was different from the observation in the catalytic cracking of saturated TGs, in which the yields of the fatty acids and ketones were higher than that of the aldehydes [16]. Thus, the aldehyde formation pathway is more active in Euglena WE cracking than in TG cracking. Fig. 5 shows the yield of C13 and C14 hydrocarbons with different residence time. As mentioned in the previous section, the C13 and C14 hydrocarbons are the initial products of the deoxygenation reaction. The C13 yield was higher than that of C14 for n-paraffins, whereas the C14 yield was higher than that of C13 for i-paraffins and olefins (especially in short residence times). The yields of n-paraffins and olefins decreased as extending residence time, which was the most drastic in the C14 olefin yield. In contrast, the yield of i-paraffins initially increased and then slightly decreased. These results indicate that n-paraffins and olefins are initially produced from the deoxygenation reaction, whereas i-paraffins are secondary products. With a sufficient residence time, i-paraffins are also cracked into smaller hydrocarbons."
7,Discussion,"The decomposition of esters has been widely investigated in thermal and catalytic cracking. Initially, esters undergo thermal transformation via a β-elimination mechanism [30,31]. In the case of WE cracking shown in Fig. 6 , the β-elimination reaction produces saturated fatty acids and higher olefins (R1), which were observed in Figs. 4b and 5c, respectively. The higher olefins are very reactive in the catalytic cracking process and their reactions can be well explained with a mechanism involving carbenium ion intermediates [24]. The higher olefins are rapidly converted to carbenium ions on Brønsted acid sites of the zeolite catalysts (R2), thus the yield of C14 olefins rapidly decreases in Fig. 5c. The carbenium ions are converted to i-paraffins, observed in Fig. 5b, through the isomerization and hydride abstraction from paraffins or naphtnenes (R3). Otherwise, the carbenium ions are converted to gasoline-fraction hydrocarbons (paraffins, olefins and naphthenes) through β-scission reaction (R4). The gasoline-fraction olefins and naphthenes can be cracked to gaseous hydrocarbons (R5) or can work as hydrogen donors by releasing hydrogen species through a cyclization and aromatization reaction (R7 and R8). On the other hand, the fatty acids have three deoxygenation pathways in the catalytic cracking process; direct decarboxylation (R10), ketonic decarboxylation (R11 – R13) and hydrodeoxygenation (R14 – R16) [16]. Among the three pathways, the hydrodeoxygenation via aldehyde formation is accelerated by the enhancement of hydrogen-transfer activity of the catalyst [16] or the coexistence of hydrogen donors [32,33]. Thus, in the Euglena WE cracking on the RFCC E-cat, which exhibits strong hydrogen-transfer activity, the hydrodeoxygenation pathway is accelerated by receiving hydrogen species released from the gasoline-fraction olefins and naphthenes derived from the higher olefins. This can be confirmed by the high aldehyde yield and low CO2 yield as shown in Fig. 4b and Table 2, respectively. The deoxygenation of fatty acids produces jet-fuel/LCO-range paraffins and olefins, and the consecutive β-scission of them produces gasoline-range hydrocarbons (R17). At this time, the hydrogen species transferred from the hydrogen donor to the oxygenates have not been identified. However, the hydrogen species should not be molecular hydrogens (H2) because of the following two reasons. 1) Under N2 flow, the H2 yield shown in Table 3 corresponds to that the partial pressure of H2 in the reactor is lower than 7 kPa although typical hydrodeoxygenation processes are operated under several MPa of H2. Despite the extremely low H2 partial pressure, the deoxygenation selectivity to H2O in WE cracking was higher than that to CO2 or CO; the mole-based yield of H2O was even higher than that of H2 by almost two orders of magnitude. 2) Hydrodeoxygenation process under H2 atmosphere requires transition metal or metal sulfide catalysts that can activate molecular H2 [34,35], but the RFCC catalysts do not contain such species. On the other hand, the hydrogen transfer reaction on the zeolite catalysts in petroleum cracking process (naphthene + olefin → aromatics + paraffin) has been investigated by Potapenko et al. [25]. They concluded that the hydrogen species involved in the hydrogen transfer reaction are protons from Brønsted acid sites of the zeolite and hydride ions from the hydrogen donor. Considering the above, the hydrogen species transferred from the hydrogen donor to the oxygenates may be protons and hydride ions, which should be clarified in the future work. Finally we compared the reaction mechanism of WE cracking with that of TG cracking. In the case of the saturated TG cracking, the initial β-elimination reaction produces two fatty acids, aldketene, and acrolein [36,37]. Due to its instability, the aldketene rapidly decomposes [38]. Meanwhile, acrolein decomposes to olefins such as propylene, aromatizes via a Diels-Alder reaction, or polymerizes to form coke [39], but it does not exhibit as strong a hydrogen-donating ability as the higher olefins produced from Euglena WE. Therefore, the hydrodeoxygenation of fatty acids is less active, resulting in the production of a large amount of CO2 or CO (Table 2). In contrast, unsaturated TGs have a strong hydrogen-donating ability because the unsaturated carbon chains are very reactive and rapidly produce a large amount of hydrogen donors (gasoline-fraction olefins and naphthenes) through a cracking reaction. Thus, the hydrodeoxygenation of ester bonds is activated and results in low CO2 and CO yields. However, the hydrogen-donating ability of unsaturated TGs is much higher than that required for the deoxygenation of ester bonds [33]. The excess hydrogen species released from hydrogen donors are consumed by the hydrogen-transfer reaction with olefins in gaseous and gasoline fractions to produce paraffins. The hydrogenation of olefins (high octane rate) to paraffins (low octane rate) decreases the octane rate of the produced gasoline. The progress of the hydrogen-transfer reaction is confirmed by the high butane/butene ratio in Fig. 2a. In addition, the hydrogen donors (gasoline-fraction olefins and naphthenes) are converted to aromatics by cyclization and aromatization, which results in the high aromatics yield. Furthermore, a large amount of carbenium ions produced from unsaturated carbon chains interacts with paraffins via hydrogen-transfer reactions, which activates paraffins (converts them to carbenium ions by chain reaction mechanism) and results in a cyclization and aromatization reaction that produce aromatics. Then, the high concentration of aromatics results in a condensation reaction which produces polyaromatics. Therefore, the gasoline, jet fuel and LCO fractions from unsaturated TG cracking are dominated by aromatic hydrocarbons (Fig. 2), which are unsuitable for fuel applications. In contrast, in the case of the Euglena WE cracking, the higher olefins produced from the initial β-elimination reaction are highly reactive and converted to hydrogen donors via a cracking reaction, but the saturated fatty acids are relatively stable and they work as hydrogen acceptors in the hydrogen-transfer hydrodeoxygenation reaction. Because the oxygenated compounds such as fatty acids and aldehydes preferentially receive hydrogen species (R14 and R15) than gaseous and gasoline-fraction olefins do (R6 and R9) [33], the hydrogenation of olefins does not proceed so much in the WE cracking. Thus the gasoline, jet fuel and LCO fractions contain large amounts of paraffins and olefins instead of aromatics. Considering the above, Euglena WE was confirmed to be more suitable than TGs as a feedstock of hydrocarbon fuel production in a catalytic cracking process."
8,Conclusions,"The deoxygenation and hydrocarbon formation in the catalytic cracking of Euglena WE was investigated. WEs are initially converted to saturated fatty acids and higher olefins by β-elimination reaction. The higher olefins are highly reactive and decomposed to gasoline-fraction olefins and naphthenes, which can release hydrogen species through cyclization and aromatization. The hydrogen species are consumed in the deoxygenation of the saturated fatty acids to produce H2O and jet-fuel/LCO-range paraffins and olefins. Therefore, the deoxygenation of WEs in catalytic cracking proceeds with a faster reaction rate, higher H2O selectivity, and suppression of polyaromatics formation compared with that of TGs."
