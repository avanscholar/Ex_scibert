0,Introduction,"The final disposal of dairy wastewater presents various issues. These effluents have different compositions according to the dairy product made, such as cheese, yogurt, milk, and butter (Prazeres et al., 2012). Cheese is a major agricultural product. Nine kilograms of cheese whey is produced for every kilogram of manufactured cheese. Cheese whey is considered a highly polluting effluent from dairy products due to its high organic load and the volume generated, representing a significant environmental impact for the dairy industry (Carvalho et al., 2013; Prazeres et al., 2012). Cheese whey is a highly biodegradable wastewater composed of lactose (70–72% dry extract), protein (8–10%), and minerals (12–15% dry extract) (Perna et al., 2013). The anaerobic digestion process is a particularly attractive solution for treating this type of wastewater due to the operational savings and bioenergy generated from a renewable source of inexpensive and abundant raw materials, promoting a reduction in wastewater pollution (Dareioti et al., 2009). The fermentation of cheese whey, whose main component is lactose (a disaccharide consisting of one molecule of glucose and one molecule of galactose), may produce a maximum yield of 8mol of hydrogen and 4mol of acetate, or 4mol of hydrogen and 2mol of butyrate per mole of lactose (Davila-Vazquez et al., 2011). Some researchers have demonstrated the potential of using cheese whey as a fermentation substrate for the production of hydrogen (Carrillo-Reyes et al., 2012; Perna et al., 2013). However, several parameters are not yet well established and must be further investigated. The effect of using inocula of different origins has not been reported in the literature. The choice of inoculum is important for the selection of microorganisms and thus favorable hydrogen production (Tang et al., 2008). Using different inoculum sources at a controlled pH may result in different percentages of metabolites produced, such as acetate and ethanol, as well as differing amounts of organic substrate consumed. The acclimatization of the biomass chosen as the inoculum source is important to achieving greater consumption of the substrate and greater hydrogen production (Abreu et al., 2010). The hydraulic retention time (HRT) is also an important parameter in fermentation processes. Higher rates of volumetric hydrogen production and increased percentages of hydrogen in biogas can be obtained by decreasing the HRT and thus increasing the organic loading rate (OLR) (Carrillo-Reyes et al., 2012; Davila-Vazquez et al., 2009). Changes in OLR have a considerable influence on the diversity of the microbial population and on the metabolism pathways of bacteria that may favor hydrogen production (Hafez et al., 2010). Some authors who used cheese whey as a substrate have verified an increase in the hydrogen yield with increasing OLR (Castello et al., 2009; Perna et al., 2013). However, other authors have observed a decrease in yield with increasing OLR (Azbar et al., 2009; Davila-Vazquez et al., 2009). Cheese whey as a substrate has been studied in continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) (Azbar et al., 2009; Davila-Vazquez et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2007). Although the stirring conditions of these systems can efficiently improve mass transfer, operating CSTRs at low HRTs may result in the washout of cells (Carrillo-Reyes et al., 2012). Anaerobic fluidized bed reactors (AFBRs) are high-rate systems that favor mass transfer between the medium and biofilm. Moreover, AFBRs have been used successfully for biological hydrogen production (Barros and Silva, 2012; Shida et al., 2012). Thus, the present study aims to evaluate the effect of HRT (4, 2, and 1h) and different inoculum sources on hydrogen production using cheese whey as a substrate in AFBRs."
1,Methods,
2,Analytical methods,"2.1 Analytical methods The Carbohydrate analyses were performed according Dubois et al. (1956). The biogas produced in the reactors was measured by a Ritter MilliGas counter (TG1; Ritter Inc., Germany). The composition of the biogas was analyzed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-2010) using a Supelco Carboxen Plot 1010 column (length: 30m, internal diameter: 0.53mm) with argon as the carrier gas. Acids and alcohols were determined with a liquid chromatograph (HPLC Shimadzu) equipped with a pump (LC-10ADVP), auto sampler (SIL-20A HT), column oven (CTO-20A) at 43°C, refractive index detector (RID-10A), controller (SCL-10AVP) system, and Aminex column HPX-87H (300mm, 7.8mm, BioRad). The mobile phase consisted of H2SO4 (0.01N) at 0.5mLmin−1."
3,PCR/DGGE and phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene,"2.2 PCR/DGGE and phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene At the end of each fermentation, biomass samples were taken for each HRT applied (4, 2, and 1h) in both reactors to analyze the effect of HRT on the microbial community using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The organisms were sequenced and identified using samples from AFBR2 with an HRT of 1h. Genomic DNA was extracted by cell lysis with glass beads (Sigma), phenol, chloroform, and phosphate buffer. The 16S rRNA fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers 968FGC-1401R (Nübel et al., 1996) for the bacteria community and primers Parch519fGC-Arch915r (Vissers et al., 2009) for the archaea community. The 16S rRNA fragments were then subjected to DGGE. Using denaturing gradient concentrations of 45% and 65%, DGGE was prepared for community of bacteria and archaea. The electrophoresis conditions were 75V and 60°C for 16h. The DGGE band profiles were obtained using an Eagle Eye III TM (Stratagene) at 254nm and Eagle Sight software. Pearson’s correlations for the band profiles were calculated by BioNumerics software version 2.5. Cloning and 16S rRNA sequence determination used primers 27F-1100R (Lane, 1991) and 21F-Arch958R (Vissers et al., 2009) to identify the bacteria and archaea populations, respectively. The purified PCR products were cloned into plasmid pGEM Easy Vector System I according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Transformation was achieved in competent cells of Escherichia coli. The cloned DNA fragments were recovered by PCR using the primers M13F and M13R. The PCR products were sequenced by Macrogen (Macrogen; http://www.macrogen.com). These sequences were compared with the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and Ribosomal Database Project (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/seqmatch). The phylogenetic tree was developed using the software MEGA version 5.2 using the neighbor joining method. The confidence of tree was evaluated by the bootstrap method using 1000 replications. The sequences from this study were deposited in GenBank, with accession numbers ranging from KF848958 to KF848979."
4,Sludge and substrate,"2.3 Sludge and substrate Two inocula from different origin sources were used in this study. AFBR1 was inoculated with sludge from a UASB reactor used in the treatment of swine wastewater (In_1). AFBR2 was inoculated with sludge from a UASB reactor that treated poultry slaughterhouse wastewater (In_2). These inocula were subjected to heat treatment according to Kim et al. (2006). The cheese whey powder used as substrate in this study was supplied by Cargill Agrícola S/A. Micronutrients were added with the following concentrations (in mgL−1): NiSO4·6H2O (0.48), FeSO4·7H2O (2.40), FeCl3·6H2O (0.24), CoCl2·2H2O (0.04), CaCl2·6H2O (23.40), SeO2 (0.04), urea (624.00), KH2PO4 (42.40), K2HPO4 (10.83), and Na2HPO·4H2O (16.67). The cheese whey was diluted to 5000mgCODL−1 and had an initial pH of 6 and a total carbohydrate content of 4gL−1. The pH was controlled within the range of 4.0–4.5 with NaHCO3."
5,Set-up and operating conditions of the reactors,"2.4 Set-up and operating conditions of the reactors Two reactors were constructed of transparent acrylic, with a volume of 770mL each (Fig. 1 ). Polystyrene was used as a support material for biomass immobilization, with a mean diameter of 2.2cm. The reactor was fed with cheese whey powder, diluted to 5000mgL−1, and heat-treated sludge (10% v/v). The total liquid flow (Q) was maintained at 76Lh−1, and the superficial velocity was maintained at 1.3 times the minimum fluidization velocity. Nitrogen gas was used to sparge the fermentation medium to create an anaerobic environment. The reactor temperature was maintained at 30°C. The system was initially operated in batch mode for 72h to promote the adhesion of microorganisms to the support material and then operated continuously at an HRT of 4h. When steady-state conditions were reached (i.e., hydrogen production varied by less than 10%), the HRT was set to 4, 2, and 1h (OLRs of 30, 60, and 120kgm−3 d−1, respectively). The reactors were operated for 100days, divided into three operational phases (Phase 1, HRT 4h; Phase 2, HRT 2h; and Phase 3, HRT 1h). Biogas composition and soluble metabolites were monitored as a function of time."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effect of HRT on reactor performance,"3.1 Effect of HRT on reactor performance Fig. 2 presents the effect of HRT on the conversion of lactose and content of biogas for reactors AFBR1 and AFBR2. The influent lactose content had an average value of 3200mgL−1 for both reactors. The effluent lactose values varied from 270 to 311mgL−1 and from 139 to 454mgL−1 for AFBR1 and AFBR2, respectively. A reduction in HRT from 4 to 1h resulted in an average 90% lactose conversion in AFBR1. However, in AFBR2, the conversion decreased from 95% to 85% with the reduction in HRT. H2 content in AFBR1 was more stable throughout the phases; it was ranged from 26% to 30% with varying HRT. In AFBR2, a reduction in biogas H2 content was observed, dropping from 29% to 10% upon reducing the HRT from 4 to 1h. For an HRT of 1h, methane content was 16% in the biogas for both reactors. Fig. 3 presents the behavior of the hydrogen yield (HY), methane yield (MY), hydrogen production rate (HPR), and methane production rate (MPR) for the two reactors. HY was stable in AFBR1 (1.0–1.3molH2 mol−1 lactose), whereas it decreased from 1.21 to 0.44molmol−1 lactose in AFBR2 upon reducing the HRT from 4 to 1h. The decreased HY can be explained by the decrease in H2 content, and a linear regression indicates that the correlation between HY (y) and HRT (x) can be expressed as y =0.2514x +0.22 (r 2 =0.9884) in AFBR2. Already MY were 0.71 and 1.26molCH4 mol−1 lactose at HRT of 1h for AFBR1 and AFBR2, respectively. For AFBR2, the MY was higher than HY, thus explaining the sharp drop in HY in this reactor. The HPR values increased from 0.23 to 0.74Lh−1 L−1 (AFBR1) and from 0.22 to 0.51Lh−1 L−1 (AFBR2) when HRT was reduced. The increased HPR with reduced HRT has been reported in other studies using cheese whey as a substrate (Carrillo-Reyes et al., 2012; Davila-Vazquez et al., 2009). Even with the heat treatment of the sludge and the acidic conditions of the reactor, methane was produced concurrently with hydrogen in both reactors, with MPR values of 0.47 and 0.68LCH4 h−1 L−1 for AFBR1 and AFBR2, respectively, with an applied HRT of 1h. For AFBR1, these MPR values were lower than the HPR values; however, this behavior was not observed in AFBR2. We observed the highest MPR in AFBR2, resulting in the lowest HY (0.44molH2 mol−1 lactose). Some studies in the literature reported methane production at low pH values when using different substrates, such as tequila vinasses (Buitron and Carvajal, 2010) and tapioca wastewater (Thanwised et al., 2012). When using cheese whey, methanogenesis was reported in acidic conditions in different experimental conditions (Azbar et al., 2009; Carrillo-Reyes et al., 2012; Castello et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2007). Methanogenic archaea likely adapted to the acidic conditions (pH 4–5.5) imposed on the operating systems. Therefore, heat treatment is not effective for eliminating methanogenic archaea from inocula, as observed in this study (Buitron and Carvajal, 2010; Carrillo-Reyes et al., 2012). The concomitant production of hydrogen and methane was also reported by Carrillo-Reyes et al. (2012) using different operational strategies and structures of inoculum from cheese whey in a UASB. The authors observed the presence of methane when applying 20gCODL−1 d−1 and reducing the HRT from 24 to 6h, as verified in this study. Moreover, the authors observed a decrease in HPR from 0.03 to 0.015LH2 L−1 h−1. The delay in methane production in this reactor compared to other reactors in their study was due to the application of high substrate concentrations. The highest MPR of 0.02Lh−1 L−1 was obtained with an HRT of 6h, ranging from loads of 5 to 20gCODL−1. Thanwised et al. (2012) also observed methane at low pH levels, to evaluate the effect of HRT (24–3h) on hydrogen production from tapioca wastewater. The reduction of HRT from 24 to 3h resulted in an increased methane content; a maximum percentage of 3.7% was found, thus decreasing the HPR."
8,Effect of HRT and OLR on the HY,"3.2 Effect of HRT and OLR on the HY In this study, using cheese whey as a substrate, a decrease of HY was observed upon reducing the HRT, and thus, an increased OLR was observed in AFBR2. Previous studies of hydrogen production have been performed with industrial wastewater at various OLRs by varying the substrate concentration and HRT (Table 1 ). These studies were conducted using rice straw (Tawfik and Salem, 2012), palm oil (Singh et al., 2013), and tapioca wastewater (Thanwised et al., 2012), with OLRs values ranging from 1.6 to 138.6kgm−3 d−1. Increased OLR favored HY in some studies (Singh et al., 2013; Tawfik and Salem, 2012), whereas an increased OLR resulted in a decreased HY in other studies (Davila-Vazquez et al., 2009; Thanwised et al., 2012). Even with different substrates and experimental conditions, it is possible to verify that studies have the same behavior between HY and HRT this study. Furthermore, recent studies in AFBRs have been performed from simple substrates such as glucose (Barros and Silva, 2012; Shida et al., 2012) also getting difficult to compare since the cheese whey is considered a more complex substrate than glucose. The effect of OLR has been previously investigated in the literature using cheese whey as a substrate (Azbar et al., 2009; Davila-Vazquez et al., 2009; Perna et al., 2013). Azbar et al. (2009) evaluated the effect of HRT on hydrogen production in a CSTR. With a constant COD of 40gL−1, they obtained HY values of 22, 15, and 5mmolH2 g−1 COD for HRTs of 3.5, 2, and 1d, respectively. This same behavior was shown by Davila-Vazquez et al. (2009), who also observed decreased HY by reducing the HRT, as shown in the present study in AFBR2. By using a CSTR and applying three HRT values (10, 6, and 4h), the authors obtained a maximum HY of 2.4molmol−1 lactose at the highest HRT applied (10h). The HY decreased from 2.4 to 1molmol−1 lactose when the HRT was reduced from 10 to 4h. In contrast to these studies, Perna et al. (2013) increased the OLR (22, 33, and 37gCODL−1 d−1) with a fixed HRT of 24h and observed an increased HY (0.2–0.6molH2 mol−1 lactose). According to Gioannis et al. (2013), there is a discrepancy in the literature regarding the effect of OLR and HY. According to these authors, the OLR is affected by the accumulation of acid, pH changes, and variations in the composition that subsequently change the metabolic pathways. Most of the authors cited above have attributed H2 inhibition to the accumulation of acids. According to Singh et al. (2013), the accumulation of these acids can cause reactor instability and prevent the culture from using the substrate effectively. These same authors reported that bacteria are inhibited by low OLR (15kgm−3 d−1) due to a shift in the bacterial population to non-hydrogen-producing strains. Regarding AFBR reactors operated at low HRT as the one reported in this study (of 1h), HY values also decreased considerably in AFBR reactors used by Barros and Silva (2012) and Shida et al. (2012), both with glucose as substrate. These authors associated the HY drop due to TVFA inhibition at higher OLR, situation that may have occurred in this study using cheese whey as a substrate. In this sense, Thanwised et al. (2012) associated a drop in HY to competition from other pathways, in which the substrate was used to produce other products, such as ethanol, acetic, and butyric acids, instead of hydrogen. In this study, the appearance of methane, influenced negatively on the reactor performance AFBR2. Possibly the methanogenic archaea consumed hydrogen, resulting in drop HY from reduction of the HRT. The maximum HY of 1.33molmol−1 lactose was obtained at the highest HRT (4h) and slowest OLR (30kgm−3 d−1). These results are similar to those obtained by Azbar et al. (2009) and Davila-Vazquez et al. (2009). Thus, the increased HY is related to the choice of an appropriate range of OLR values. The difficulty in establishing an appropriate OLR range is due to the complexity of hydrogen production in terms of the different bacterial species responsible for hydrogen production, the dependence of their metabolism on environmental conditions, and their coexistence with other microorganisms in the system."
9,Soluble microbial products,"3.3 Soluble microbial products Table 2 presents the soluble microbial products (SMPs) associated with the reduction of HRT. The SMP for AFBR1 were ethanol (0.22–1.22molmol−1 lactose) methanol (0.68–0.91molmol−1 lactose) acetic acid (0.17–0.51molmol−1 lactose), butyric (0.31–0.41molmol−1 lactose) and propionic acid (0.37–0.4molmol−1 lactose). For AFBR2, the SMPs were ethanol (0.74–1.17molmol−1 lactose), methanol (1.12–1.44molmol−1 lactose), acetic acid (0.16–0.95molmol−1 lactose), butyric (0.3–0.37molmol−1 lactose) and propionic acid (0.46–0.62molmol−1 lactose). For both reactors, there was a decrease in ethanol from 1.22 to 0.22molmol−1 lactose (AFBR1) and 0.98 to 0.74molmol−1 lactose (AFBR2) when the HRT was reduced. There was also an accumulation of acetic acid, increasing from 0.21 to 0.51molmol−1 lactose (AFBR1) and 0.28 to 0.95molmol−1 lactose (AFBR2), when the HRT was reduced. This accumulation of acid (0.51 and 0.95molmol−1 lactose) affected the HY, as reported by other authors (Singh et al., 2013). Methanol and butyric acid were more stable. For AFBR1, there was a greater accumulation of propionic acid for an HRT of 1h (18.2%). However, even finding concentrations of propionic acid, possible other favorable metabolic pathways to produce hydrogen as ethanol, acetate and butyrate, prevailed upon the pathway of propionic acid, obtaining satisfactory results yield when compared with the literature. Higher HRT values (4 and 2h) were more favorable for the simultaneous production of hydrogen and ethanol. It was possible to obtain EtOH yields (EtOHY) of 1.22 and 1.13molEtOHmol−1 lactose, similar to the HY values (1.3 and 1.1molH2 mol−1 lactose) obtained by AFBR1 (sludge swine) and the EtOHY values of 0.98 and 1.17molEtOHmol−1 lactose obtained by AFBR2. Thus, the predominant type of fermentation produced ethanol; from 1mol of glucose it is possible to produce 2mol of hydrogen and 1mol of ethanol (Hwang et al., 2004). Recently, hydrogen and ethanol fermentation has received considerable attention in the literature research, and the possibility of simultaneous production of these two components (Barros and Silva, 2012; Lay et al., 2012) demonstrates the viability of pathway concomitant production of hydrogen and ethanol. In this study, the highest ethanol yields were obtained at an HRT of 4h (1.33molmol−1 lactose), was obtained. This metabolic pathway was strongly influenced by the reduction of HRT and increased OLR, and an HRT of 1h (OLR of 120kgm−3 d−1) inhibited the production of ethanol. AFBR1 (sludge swine) was more stable in terms of hydrogen production, with little variation in HY (1.06–1.33molH2 mol−1 lactose), whereas AFBR2 was more stable in terms of ethanol production (0.74–1.17molEtOHmol−1 lactose) upon reducing the HRT. These results demonstrated the different behavior between the two inocula according to their different sources of origin."
10,Composition of the bacterial communities,"3.4 Composition of the bacterial communities PCR/DGGE analysis was used to compare the band profiles of the bacterial communities (Fig. 4 a) and archaea communities (Fig. 4b) in reactors AFBR1 and AFBR2 during the 100days of operation for all HRTs applied. There was 48% similarity between the populations of bacterial communities from the inocula and from the operational phases of the hydrogen production reactors. Thus, major changes occurred in the bacterial populations throughout the operation of the reactors. AFBR1 and AFBR2 exhibited 86% and 82% similarity, respectively, among populations observed in all applied HRTs. The highest HY values were obtained at an HRT of 4h for both reactors. However, there was no major difference compared to other applied HRTs in terms of the bacteria populations. The band profiles were 83% similar between the two inocula (In_1 and In_2), i.e., between the populations of bacteria with different inoculum sources, AFBR1 being from sludge from a UASB reactor used in the treatment of swine wastewater (In_1) and AFBR2 being from sludge from a UASB reactor that treated poultry slaughterhouse wastewater (In_2). For the band profile of methanogenic archaea (Fig. 4b) in AFBR1, there was 93% similarity among all HRTs (4, 2, and 1h). Similar behaviors and Pearson’s correlations were observed in AFBR2. Therefore, no significant changes were observed according to the HRT applied for the populations of methanogenic archaea. The methanogenic archaea likely require more time to adapt, although methane (16%) was detected at an HRT of 1h with longer operation time (70d). A similarity of 78% was observed in the methanogenic archaea communities of the inocula (In_1 and In_2) due to the different inoculum sources of origin. When comparing samples from the biomass reactors to inocula samples, the band profiles of methanogenic archaea had 41% similarity. In this case, there were significant changes in methanogenic archaea throughout the operation of the reactors. Due to the production of methane at an HRT of 1h, in AFBR2 microbial identification was performed through the cloning and sequencing of fragments of 16S rRNA for the communities of bacteria and methanogenic archaea. A total of 78 clones were obtained for the bacterial community (Table 3 ). These clones were grouped into 17 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and the affiliate families Veillonellaceae (85% relative abundance), Streptococcaceae (6.4% relative abundance), and Clostridiaceae (7.6% relative abundance) corresponded to only one phylum (Firmicutes). A high similarity was observed with Selenomonas sp., corresponding to the family Veillonellaceae, order of Selenomonadales, with the highest percentage related to Selenomonas lacticifex strain DSM20757 (OTU 7 and 16), representing 69% of all sequences. Selenomonas are not endospore-forming bacteria, whose metabolic end-products consist mainly of acetic, propionic, and lactic acid. Selenomonas sp. have been shown to possess some capability for hydrogen fermentation using glucose or lactate as substrate, as described by Michel and Macy (1990). Luo et al. (2008) evaluated the effect of OLR on the bacterial community with glucose as a substrate. The authors found that the smallest OLRs (0.5gCODL−1 h−1) yielded the largest HY (2.8molmol−1 glucose), attributing this result to the presence of Selenomonas sp. In AFBRs, Shida et al. (2012) also observed a similarity with representatives of Veillonellaceae in a reactor fed with glucose at controlled pH with an HRT of 2h. Under such conditions, the authors obtained high HY values, i.e., 1.9molH2 mol−1 glucose. The other sequences of the 16S rRNA gene were similar to the Clostridiacea family, specifically the genus Clostridium (92 and 99% similarity). The members of genus Clostridium are Gram-positive, endospore-forming rods that produce hydrogen. Some strains of Clostridium sp., Erwinia sp., and Pseudomonas sp. are able to produce methanol as a major end product during growth on pectin medium, as described by Schink and Zeikus (1980), thus justifying the considerable amounts of methanol found in this study. In studies with cheese whey, Yang et al. (2007) also obtained a similarity with Clostridium when evaluating the effect of different OLRs at an HRT of 24h. A similarity to Lactococcus and uncultured bacteria of the order of Lactobacillales and family of Streptococcaceae was also observed in AFBR2. However, it is unclear whether Streptococcaceae species are capable of producing hydrogen. Davila-Vazquez et al. (2009) investigated hydrogen production with cheese whey as a substrate and also verified the presence of species from Streptococcaceae. Representatives of this family are Gram-positive and non-endospore-forming facultative anaerobes. The main product of these bacteria is lactic acid (Lancefield, 1933). In this research, the concentrations of HPr and HAc varied from 0.46 to 0.61molmol−1 lactose and from 0.16 to 0.95molmol−1 lactose, respectively, and no HLa was detected. As exposed, Selenomonas strains are able to produce propionate and acetate from a serious of carbohydrates, including lactate (Michel and Macy, 1990). Although the intermediary metabolic products investigation was not performed during this study, the verified organic acids in the AFBR2 demonstrate that occurred HLa consumption, and HPr and HAc production, as well as hydrogen detected on the biogas. During hydrogen fermentation, the following acetogenic reactions (Eqs. (1)–(3) can occur, involving the presence of lactate, which is the preferred substrate for propionate and acetate forming bacteria (Lee et al., 2008; Saady, 2013): (1) Pyruvate + NADH → CH 3 CHOHCOOH + NAD + (2) CH 3 CHOHCOOH + 2 H 2 O → CH 3 COOH + HCO 3 + 2 H 2 (3) CH 3 CHOHCOOH + NADH → 2 CH 3 CH 2 COOH + NAD + The phylogenetic tree (Fig. 5 ) displays the bacterial population and phylogenetic grouping of OTUs with the resulting sequences from NCBI for reactor AFBR2. Other bacteria, such as those related to Lactobacillus, have been observed in hydrogen production from complex wastewater. Carrillo-Reyes et al. (2012) and Yang et al. (2007) associated their high hydrogen production with the presence of Lactobacillus from cheese whey. The community composition of methanogenic archaea (Table 4 ) obtained by cloning and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene resulted in 68 clones, which were grouped into five OTUs, affiliated with the genus Methanobacterium. This genus belongs to the Methanobacteriaceae family, order Methanobacteriales, and phylum Euryarchaeota. Representatives of Methanobacterium are hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea, i.e., they use hydrogen and carbon dioxide to produce methane (Horn et al., 2003). This behavior explains the lowest HY (0.44molmol−1 lactose) obtained in AFBR2 at an HRT of 1h, far from the maximum theoretical value (8molH2 mol−1 lactose). Methanogenic archaea typically grow at higher pH values; however, some acidophilus Methanobacterium species are also favored in acidic conditions. Such archaea have the ability to grow and produce methane at a pH below 5, being highly adaptable to their conditions (Horn et al., 2003). This property was shown by Taconi et al. (2007), who found a 30% increase in methanogenic activity when the pH was decreased from 7 to 4.5. The phylogenetic tree with OTUs of attached biomass in the reactor AFBR2 for the archaea domain is shown in Fig. 6 ."
11,Conclusions,"The feasibility of producing hydrogen and ethanol from cheese whey was observed. A maximum HY of 1.33molH2 mol−1 lactose and a maximum EtOHY of 1.22molEtOHmol−1 lactose were obtained. For an HRT of 1h, methane (0.68LCH4 h−1 L−1) was produced with hydrogen (0.51LH2 h−1 L−1). In accordance with the reduction in HRT, the reactor inoculated with swine sludge (AFBR1) demonstrated more stable results for HY, whereas the other reactor, with poultry slaughterhouse sludge (AFBR2), achieved a more stable EtOHY. Sequences of 16S rRNA were observed to be similar to Selenomonas, Clostridium, and Methanobacterium in AFBR2."
