0,Introduction,"H2O2, as an organic synthetic energy material, has a wide range of uses in industry and daily life due to its environmentally friendly and high energy density characteristics. Moreover, because it is easy to store, it is very promising to be the next generation of sustainable solar fuel [1]. Presently, producing H2O2 mainly contains anthraquinone, alcohol oxidation, and electrochemical synthesis methods [2–4]. The anthraquinone method is the mainstream, accounting for more than 95% of the total output [5]. The anthraquinone method's main steps include hydrogenation, oxidation, hydrogen peroxide extraction, purification, recycling of working solution and other reaction steps. Its demand for energy consumption is very high, and, to some extent, it is harmful to the environment [6]. Nowadays, developing efficient and environment-friendly methods has become a hot topic. In recent years, the direct oxidation of H2 and O2 via a metal catalyst to synthesize H2O2 was once regarded as an effective alternative process for the anthraquinone process [7–10]. On this basis, many studies on the direct synthesis of H2O2 have been carried out, such as the natural synthesis of H2O2 with Au-Pd bimetal catalysis [7]. This method has the advantages of green and high efficiency, but there are serious safety risks such as explosions. Besides, precious metals as catalysts are very expensive, and the use of a large amount of inert gas also increases its cost. Therefore, it is urgent to find a novel, green, efficient, and safe production technology for H2O2. Photocatalytic production of H2O2 was first proposed by Baur and Neuweiler [11]. This technology only involves light, water, molecular oxygen and semiconductor photocatalysts. Compared with the anthraquinone method and direct gas synthesis, photocatalytic technology has low energy consumption and has no safety risks basically. In recent years, it has attracted widespread attention [12]. The mechanism usually involves two main half-reaction processes: photogenerated holes (h+) in the valence band oxidize water to produce oxygen (O2) and protons (H+) (Eq. 1); the conduction band electrons (e-) reduce O2 to generate H2O2 (Eqs. 2 or 3, 4). (1) H 2 O + 2 h + 1 / 2 O 2 + 2 H + (2) O 2 + 2 H + + 2 e − → H 2 O 2 (3) O 2 + e − · O 2 − (4) · O 2 − + 2 H + + e − H 2 O 2 · H 2 O + 1 / 2 O 2 H 2 O 2 Δ G ° = 117 KJ / mol [13] TiO2, as earlier photocatalytic material, can produce a certain amount of H2O2 when blow O2 in a mixed solution of water and alcohol after UV irradiation [14]. The reaction process is as follows: the photogenerated h+ has the strong oxidizing property, it can oxidize organic electron donors such as alcohols to aldehydes and simultaneously generate H+; the photogenerated e- on the TiO2 surface (surface Ti3+ site) reduces O2 and produces a superoxo radical (O2 -), which is transformed to H2O2 by further reduction by e− [15]. However, its efficiency is very low because the selectivity for the amount of the formed H2O2 relative to the amount of the consumed alcohol is less than 1%. Besides, several catalysts include inorganic and organic-based compounds, have been proposed to generate H2O2, but it also has a low produce efficiency (<0.1 mM) [15–20]. It is because (i) they are inactive for water oxidation (Eq. (1)), (ii) they mainly promote the one-electron reduction of O2 to form superoxide ( OOH) (Eq. 5) or four-electron reduction of O2 to form water (Eq. 6), suppressing H2O2 formation reaction [15]. (5) O 2 + H + + e − → ∙ OOH (6) O 2 + 4 H + + 4 e − → 2 H 2 O Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a polymeric metal-free semiconductor and can solve the above problems. The C and N atoms are sp2 hybridized to form a highly delocalized π-conjugated system in its structure [21]. It has a graphene stack structure [22,23], which is considered attractive and applicable for potential photocatalysts. There has been much research on improving the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 [24–26]. The research on photocatalytic H2O2 production has also been carried out [12,27–33]. Shiraishi et al. [34,35] used g-C3N4 as a photocatalyst to produce H2O2 for the first time and found that H2O2 can efficiently form on the surface of g-C3N4. This proposed mechanism indicated the efficient 1,4-endoperoxide formation for g-C3N4 suppressed one-electron reduction of O2 (Eq. (5)) and four-electron reduction of O2 (Eq. (6)), thus promoting the selective two-electron reduction of O2 (Eqs. (2), (3), and (4)) and it can simultaneously inhibit the decomposition of H2O2. However, the efficiency of producing H2O2 for pure g-C3N4 is relatively low. It is mainly due to the rapid recombination of photogenerated e- and h+ and the low valence band position (~1.4 eV). According to the literature, the insertion of K+ between the g-C3N4 layers can form an electron transport channel and enhance the carrier separation between adjacent layers [36,37]. Xiong et al. [37] calculated by DFT and found that K+ interlaced into the g-C3N4 interlayer via bridging the layers could decrease the electronic localization and extend the π conjugated system, which can serve as a ""bridge"" for electron transmission. Wang et al. [38]also indicated K+ doping could make g-C3N4 possess a more effective separation efficiency of e- and h+. More importantly, it can also make the energy band position move to the higher potential and narrow the bandgap of g-C3N4, improving its oxidation ability of h+ and benefit to generate H2O2. Besides, Wang et al. [33] realized the control of the valence band of g-C3N4 through the doping of K+ and also proved that h+ can oxidized water to produceromote the one-electron reduction of O2 to form superoxidH through a high valence band and then directly synthesized H2O2 through the combination of two ·OH (Eq. 7). Zhang et al. [39] added KOH in the preparation process of g-C3N4, and the photocatalytic H2O2 production performance was improved [40]. The maximum output of H2O2 without providing electron donors such as alcohols was 170 μmol/g·h. However, the doping of K+ has a limited ability to increase the valence band (1.61–2.28 V) [41], and the ability to oxidize water is still relatively low. So, if the valence band position can be changed to make full use of the photogenerated h+, it will significantly promote photocatalytic H2O2 production. (7) · OH + · OH H 2 O 2 WO3 is an excellent candidate semiconductor with a valence band position of 3.44 eV (vs. NHE), which is suitable for oxidizing water, alcohols, and other hydrogen sources [42,43]. Up to now, a large number of studies have been conducted on the degradation of organic pollutants by the composite of g-C3N4 and WO3 [42–45]. Praus et al. prepared WO3 by hydrothermal and composited with g-C3N4 to prepare a heterojunction composite with a Z-scheme structure [44]. Zhang et al. prepared WO3-X/2D g-C3N4 (X represents the mass percentage of WO3) by combining WO3 nanorods modified with oxygen vacancies and g-C3N4 through chemical adsorption [45]. They changed the composite's valence band position and showed a noticeable promotion effect on removing the organic pollutants. However, there are few studies on the photocatalytic production of H2O2 by WO3 modified g-C3N4 composite. Therefore, we prepared K+-doped g-C3N4 (KCN) by thermal copolymerization, and combined it with WO3 nanoparticles by a facile deposition method to obtain the final photocatalytic composites KCN/WO3. Doping K+ and combining WO3 effectively promoted charge separation of g-C3N4 and KCN10/WO3(10%) retained the low conduction band of KCN10 and the high valence band of WO3, which greatly enhanced photocatalytic production of H2O2 and made the composite can produce H2O2 at the level of mmol/L without bubbling O2. Through the capture experiment and the quantitative determination experiment of ·O2 - and ·OH, it was proved that the generation of H2O2 mainly relied on the two-step single-electron reduction path of O2 and the ·O2 - and e- are the main active species. Simultaneously, the oxidation reaction of OH- by h+ in the VB of KCN10/WO3(10%) can generate H2O2 and then realize the dual-channel production of H2O2. This work provided a novel, effective, safe and environment-friendly photocatalyst for the production of H2O2."

Melamine of 10 g was taken into a beaker and KOH (0.1 mol/L) of 5, 10, and 20 ml was added, respectively. Then, the mixed solution was stirred and heated to dry on a magnetic stirrer. It was then transferred to a crucible with a lid and heated to 550 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min for 4 h. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained powder product was collected and recorded as KCNx (x represents the volume of added KOH)."

Sodium tungstate dihydrate of 4 g was dissolved in 300 ml of deionized water to form a clear solution and the pH was adjusted to 1 by hydrochloric acids. Then, the solution was heated at 80 °C for 5 h in a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. The obtained white-yellow precipitate was washed by centrifugation until the pH was neutral and dried at 110 °C for 2 h. It was transferred to a crucible with a lid and calcined at 600 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 10 ℃/min to obtain WO3 powder, then crushed in an agate mortar. For the KCN/WO3 composite, KCN of 1 g was dispersed in 300 ml deionized water, and the pH was adjusted to 2 by hydrochloric acid. And then, a certain amount of WO3 powder (0.05, 0.1, 0.2 g) was added and stirred for 2 h. The obtained composite was washed by centrifugation until the pH was neutral and dried at 110 °C for 2 h. Then, it was transferred to a crucible with a lid and calcined at 450 °C for 4 h at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The final powder was denoted as KCN/WO3 (5%), KCN/WO3 (10%) and KCN/WO3 (20%)."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization XRD analysis was performed using Cu Ka radiation with D8 advanced diffractometer (Bruck, Germany). The voltage and current are set to 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. The spectrum scans from 10° to 90° (2-Theta) at a 2°/min speed. FT-IR spectra were recorded on a VERTEX 70 infrared spectrometer with the samples dispersed in KBr pellets. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) image and energy spectrum analysis (EDS) of the material were performed on the JSM-6701 F instrument (Japan JEOL company). The basic morphology, elemental composition, and composition of the material can be known through SEM images and EDS of different magnifications. A transmission electron microscope (TEM) image of the sample was obtained using a JEM-2100 FS (JEOL, Japan) microscope at 120 kV. The optical properties were investigated by a UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectrum (Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer) and BaSO4 powder was used as reflectance standard. The composites' chemical composition and state were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The instrument was Thermo Scientific K-Alpha and the X-ray source was a monochromatic Alka source (Mono Alka). Energy: 1486.6 eV, voltage: 15KV, Beam current: 15 mA, analyzer scan mode: CAE. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra was obtained via a Hitachi F-4500 spectrophotometer using a 150 W xenon lamp as the excitation source. In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and photocurrent tests were performed on the electrochemical workstation (CHI-660B, China) using a standard three-electrode battery. The counter electrode was platinum tablets. Saturated calomel electrodes were used as the reference electrodes."
6,Photocatalytic test,"2.5 Photocatalytic test The experiment of photocatalytic H2O2 production with simulated sunlight was carried out under a 300 W xenon lamp light source. The catalyst of 0.2 g was dissolved in 200 ml of deionized water, and ethanol of 5 ml was added. The mixed solution was treated with ultrasonic in the dark for 30 min to reach the adsorption-desorption equilibrium before the photocatalytic reaction. During the photocatalytic reaction, 5 ml suspensions were quickly taken from the reactor every 1 h and filtered to remove the photocatalyst for analysis. Finally, the generated H2O2 reacted with Potassium Titanium Oxalate in acidic media to form a steady and orange complex. The H2O2 concentration was obtained by determined the orange complex using spectrophotometry(UV-2450, Shimadzu) at the wavelength of 400 nm[46]. The recycle tests were also designed to evaluate the reusability and stability of the optimal composite."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Phase structure and composition,"3.1 Phase structure and composition The XRD patterns of the synthesized samples were displayed in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1a, the pure g-C3N4 displayed different diffraction peaks at 13.1° and 27.7°, which were assigned to the in-plane structural packing motif (100) crystal plane and the interlayer-stacking structure of the conjugated aromatic system (002) crystal plane, respectively (JCPDS-87–1526) [22]. Besides, all KCNx composites with different amounts of K+ still had the same peaks with pure g-C3N4. However, compared with pure g-C3N4, KCNx can be found that the peak intensity at 27.48° was significantly weakened (Fig. 1b), and this phenomenon was the most apparent when the K+ doping amount reached 10%. Furthermore, with the addition of K+, the (002) peak was significantly shifted to a high-angle direction. The reason was that K+ was incorporated into the material's crystal lattice, making the gap between g-C3N4 layers larger, and the growth of the (002) crystal plane was obviously inhibited [37]. It was worth noting that these phenomena were conducive to the production of H2O2, which was confirmed by the later experimental results. Besides, the peak at ~27° shifted to low degree reversely for KCN20, it may be due to the excessive K+ doping, which could further damage the interlayer structure of g-C3N4 [52]. Fig. 1c revealed the XRD patterns of pure g-C3N4, KCN10 and KCN10/WO3 (10%). It can be seen that WO3 of 10% was coupled with KCN10, the characteristic crystal plane of WO3 and the crystal plane of g-C3N4 remained stable without any other impurities, which indicated that g-C3N4 and WO3 coexisted in the KCN10/WO3 (10%) composite and all the samples were high purity phase. Fig. 2 showed the Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) of g-C3N4, KCN10, and KCN10/WO3 (10%). For g-C3N4, the peak at 808 cm−1 can be attributed to the specific bending of the S-triazine ring of g-C3N4 [47,48]. The peaks at 1239,1325,1412,1568 and 1637 cm−1 were attributed to the CN and C˭N vibrations of the aromatic CN heterocycle. For KCN10, it showed the same spectrum band as pure g-C3N4 except for the band at 2200 cm−1 corresponded to the cyano group's asymmetric stretching vibration [49], which indicated K+ was inserted into the g-C3N4 structure. The spectrum of KCN10/WO3(10%) was also similar to that of KCN10, indicating that the composition of WO3 did not damage the chemical structure of g-C3N4. Significantly, in the case of the KCN10/WO3(10%) composite, the characteristic peak intensity of g-C3N4 showed a significant decrease, indicating WO3 had been combined with KCN10 successfully. XPS analyzed the surface chemical composition and element state of and the results were displayed in Fig. 3. Fig. 3a was the full spectrum scan of g-C3N4, KCN10 and KCN10/WO3(10%). Compared with g-C3N4, KCN10 did not change significantly based on the weak K+ peak. Furthermore, compared with KCN10, the peaks of O 1s peaks and W 4 f peaks can be observed in the KCN10/WO3(10%) composite, confirming the coexistence of WO3 and KCN10 in the composite. In Fig. 3b, g-C3N4, KCN10 and KCN10/WO3(10%) had identical high-resolution C1s spectra, the C 1s binding energies approximately 284.7 and 288.2 eV proved the two bonding states of the carbon material. The former was designated as a surface amorphous carbon or sp2 C-C bond, and the latter was attributed to the sp2 bonded carbon in the nitrogen-containing aromatic ring [50]. The high-resolution N1s spectra of g-C3N4, KCN10 and KCN10/WO3(10%) samples were shown in Fig. 3c. For g-C3N4, the binding energy peak of 398.7 eV can be attributed to the sp2 hybrid nitrogen related to the triazine ring (C-N˭C), and the one at 400.4 eV related to N-(C)3 groups linking structural motif (C6N7) [42]. Compared with pure g-C3N4, the peaks of KCN10 and KCN10/WO3(10%) occurred obviously shift, and they were at 398.3, 399.7 eV and 398.6, 400.1 eV, respectively. It suggested the possibility of electronic interactions among g-C3N4, K+ and WO3. Other peaks with binding energies of 404.1, 404.0 and 404.2 eV for g-C3N4, KCN10 and KCN10-WO3(10%) were assigned NH group and the charge effect related to π excitation [51]. In Fig. 3d, for KCN10 and KCN10/WO3(10%), the peak with binding energies of 293.3 eV correspond to the K 2p3/2 peaks, which was consistent with the binding energy of the K-N bond and indicated the existent of the covalent bond between K and g-C3N4 [36,52,53]. Besides, the XPS spectra showed that the doped K+ is 8.65% in the KCN10/WO3(10%), which was close to the theoretically calculated doping amount (8.36%). In the case of W4f spectra in Fig. 3e, the KCN10/WO3 (10%) composite showed three peaks at 37.2, 36.3 and 35.2 eV, corresponding to W5+ and W6+, respectively [54,55]. To confirm their VB potential, the XPS VB analysis was carried out. Through the analysis of the valence band diagram in Fig. 3f, it can be found that the valence band of KCN10 moved in a positive direction with the addition of K+ from 1.43 eV of g-C3N4 to 1.73 eV of KCN10. Besides, the valence band of pure WO3 is 2.95 eV. These results combined with XRD and FT-IR analysis proved the successful synthesis of the KCN10/WO3(10%) composite."
9,Morphology structure,"3.2 Morphology structure The morphologies of g-C3N4, WO3, KCN10 and KCN10/WO3 (10%) were observed by TEM and SEM in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4a, it was found that g-C3N4 exhibited a layered structure with interlayer stacking. In Fig. 4b, WO3 showed a plate-like structure. In Fig. 4c, KCN10 maintained a similar structure to g-C3N4, which implied that the introduction of K+ into the g-C3N4 crystal structure did not influence the morphology. In the case of KCN10/WO3(10%) composite, Fig. 4d showed that plate-like WO3 was distributed on the surface of g-C3N4 layers. In Fig. 4e, HRTEM images were used to illustrate further the KCN10/WO3 (10%) composite. The lattice fringe with a spacing of 0.375 nm corresponded to the (020) crystal planes of WO3 [56]. The g-C3N4 had no apparent crystal lattice due to the low crystallinity of g-C3N4, consistent with the existing literature reports [49]. Besides, elemental mapping based on KCN10 and KCN10/WO3(10%) was performed in Fig. 4f and g. It revealed that there appears a distribution of C, N, K, O and W across the bulk structure. These elements were well dispersed in the selected area, suggesting K+ and WO3 successfully introduced into the KCN10 and/or KCN10/WO3 (10%) composites. From the EDS results, it can be concluded that the content of each element was close to the theoretical value. In a word, the TEM and SEM mapping results confirmed that the KCN10 and KCN10/WO3 (10%) composites were successfully synthesized [57]."
10,Optical property analyses,"3.3 Optical property analyses The optical properties of g-C3N4, KCNx, KCN10/WO3 and WO3 were determined by UV-Vis diﬀuse absorption spectra, and the results were presented in Fig. 5. In Fig. 5a and b, it can be found that the absorption edge of the pure g-C3N4 was approximately 470 nm. After doping K+, the absorption edges of KCNx gradually red-shifted, and the more K+ doped, the more pronounced the red-shifted. This phenomenon can also proved that the doped-K+ can narrow the energy band of KCNx and increased the absorption of visible light, which will promote the charge transfer. The absorption edge of KCN10 was about 490 nm. However, the absorption edges of pure WO3 was about 460 nm and it was consistent the reported literature [47]. Therefore, the absorption edges of the KCN10/WO3 composites showed a more apparent blue shift with the amount of WO3 increased in Fig. 5c and d. The absorption edge of KCN10/WO3 (10%) was about 465 nm. In Fig. 6a, it can be seen that the corresponding direct band gaps values for g-C3N4, KCN10, WO3 and KCN10/WO3 (10%) were 2.67, 2.60, 2.85 and 2.75 eV, respectively. In Fig. 6b, combined with the above XPS results analysis, the VB and CB band position of g-C3N4 can be calculated to be 1.43 eV and − 1.24 eV, those of KCN10 were 1.73 eV and − 0.87 eV and those of WO3 were + 2.95 eV and + 0.1 eV, respectively. For the VB and CB band position of KCN10/WO3 (10%), it would be analyzed and speculated by the latter experiment. The charge transfer behaviors of g-C3N4, KCNx and KCN10/WO3 were studied by EIS Nyquist plots in Fig. 7a and Fig. 7b. The smaller semicircles corresponded to weaker charge resistance (RCT) in the Nyquist curve, indicating the more efficient charge transfer. In Fig. 7a, it can be seen that the arc radius of g-C3N4 was the largest, and those of KCNx became smaller as the amount of doped K+ increased, indicating that the doped K+ as a ""conductive bridge"" in the g-C3N4 structure can improve the efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole transfer. In Fig. 7b, compared with KCN10, the KCN10/WO3 composites also showed the smaller arc radius with the addition of WO3, indicating that the better electric conductivity caused more charge carriers in semiconductor photocatalysts by efficient charge separation. It was worth noting that KCN10/WO3 (10%) had the best electronic conductivity among the g-C3N4, KCN10 and KCN10/WO3(10%) composites, which will benefit the photocatalytic production of H2O2. To further evaluated the separation and recombination efficiency of photogenerated carriers, the PL emission spectra of g-C3N4, KCN10 and KCN10/WO3 (10%) were conducted in Fig. 7c. All of the samples showed a similar broad emission band centered at 425–650 nm with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm. Normally, the relatively low intensity of PL emission spectra indicated that obviously improved lifetime and efficient separation of photogenerated carriers. The pure g-C3N4 exhibited the stronger PL emission peak. However, the PL intensity of KCN10 was significantly weaker than that of pure g-C3N4 and the PL intensity of KCN10/WO3 (10%) was comparatively lower than that of KCN10, indicating the recombination of electron-hole pairs was efficiently suppressed upon doping K+ and combining WO3, which can induce a remarkable enhancement of the photocatalytic activity. The transient photocurrent responses also provided another evidence for verifying charge transfer behaviors of g-C3N4, KCN10 and KCN10/WO3 (10%) in Fig. 7d. It was noticeable that KCN10/WO3 (10%) exhibited the highest photocurrent intensity compared with those of g-C3N4 and KCN10, demonstrating that the lifetime of the photogenerated carriers of the KCN10/WO3 (10%) composite was effectively prolonged, which was consistent well with EIS and PL analysis."
11,Photocatalytic production of H2O2,"3.4 Photocatalytic production of H2O2 All the photocatalytic reactions were carried out without bubbling O2 containing photocatalysts under a 300 W xenon lamp. Time-dependent profiles of H2O2 production with different photocatalysts were shown in Fig. 8a and b. In Fig. 8a, the photocatalytic H2O2 production of KCNx was investigated. g-C3N4 can produce H2O2, but the equilibrium concentration was only about 0.05 mmol/L after 6 h. KCNx produced H2O2 more effectively than the pure g-C3N4, and the rate of H2O2 production was significantly enhanced after the incorporation of K+, and the equilibrium concentration of H2O2 production increased with an increasing amount of K+ doped into the photocatalysts. KCN10 showed the maximum photocatalytic activity, and the equilibrium concentration of H2O2 was 1 mmol/L after 6 h, which was almost 20 times more than that of g-C3N4. Such enhancement in photocatalytic performance might be due to the role of K+ served as a delivery channel via bridging the layers in the composite [37]. However, KCN20 had a lower photocatalytic performance than that of KCN10. This was because the positive movement of the conduction band position was not beneficial to the formation of ·O2 - and affected the production of H2O2. In Fig. 8b, the photocatalytic H2O2 production of KCN10/WO3 and WO3 was also investigated. It can be seen that KCN10/WO3 (10%) showed the best photocatalytic performance. After reacting 4 h, the equilibrium between the generation and decomposition of H2O2 was reached, and the equilibrium concentration was 1.33 mmol/L and the rate of H2O2 production was more quickly than that of KCN10. It was noted that the H2O2 production performance of KCN10/WO3 (20%) was significantly reduced, which was because the excessive WO3 may cover the reaction sites on KCN10 [19]. However, for pure WO3, the equilibrium concentration of H2O2 production was almost negligible, it was only 0.008 mmol/L. It was mainly due to the higher conduction band potential of WO3 (+0.1 eV Vs. NHE), which led to the conduction band electrons can not reduce oxygen to produce H2O2. Simultaneously, WO3 has a high valence band position, which can oxidize water to generate ·OH, and then generated H2O2. However, because the conduction band electrons can not participate in the reaction, it led to the electron-hole recombination, which reduced the utilization of photogenerated holes and affected the production of H2O2. The light-driven H2O2 decomposition over the KCN10/WO3 (10%) composite was conducted with an initial H2O2concentration of 0.8 mmol/L to investigate the decomposition behavior of H2O2 in the presence of photocatalysts. As shown in Fig. 8c, the H2O2 decomposed about 1% over KCN10/WO3 (10%) after 210 min, which can be ignored under the experimental conditions, indicating the composite was an excellent candidate for photocatalytic production of H2O2. To investigate the stability of the KCN10/WO3 (10%) composite, the photocatalytic production of H2O2 was recycled seven times under the same conditions. Fig. 8d showed the photocatalytic performance was almost unchanged, and the photocatalyst recovery can reach about 94.7% even after seven times. The results indicated that the KCN10/WO3 (10%) composite was photocatalytic stable."
12,Photocatalytic mechanism,"3.5 Photocatalytic mechanism To clarify the mechanism of photocatalytic production of H2O2 for the KCN10/WO3 (10%) composite, the results of active radical capture experiment for g-C3N4, KCN10 and KCN10/WO3 (10%) were compared and studied. The reactive radicals involved in the photocatalytic H2O2 generation for were detected by adding phenol, p-benzoquinone (BQ), isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and AgNO3 as scavengers, which can scavenge holes (h+), superoxide radicals (·O2 -), hydroxyl radicals (·OH) and e-, respectively ( Fig. 9a). In the presence of IPA or phenol, all the photocatalytic production efficiencies of H2O2 were reduced to a certain extent for three samples. Most notably, compared with KCN10 and g-C3N4, the production efficiency of H2O2 for KCN10/WO3 (10%) significantly decreased after adding IPA. This result indicated that ·OH was a vital reactive radicals involved in the production of H2O2 for KCN10/WO3 (10%). Furthermore, the addition of phenol and IPA had similar effects on the production of H2O2 for KCN10/WO3 (10%), which proved the primary source of ·OH was from the oxidation reaction of OH- by h+. When p-benzoquinone or AgNO3 was used in the photocatalytic reaction, all the photocatalytic production efficiency of H2O2 showed a significantly reduced for g-C3N4, KCN10 and KCN10/WO3 (10%), indicating that ·O2 - and e- were the main reaction species in the photocatalytic reaction. To further verify the production path of H2O2, the ·O2 - in the reaction system for the KCN10, KCN10/WO3 (10%) and WO3 composites were quantitatively determined. For determining ·O2 -, Nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (NBT) was chosen as a probe. Under the action of O2 -, NBT was reduced to form the insoluble blue Diformazan, and its maximum absorption peak appears at 560 nm. Furthermore, the production amount of formazan was linearly related to the amount of O2 -, so we can utilize this relationship to determine O2 - quantitatively. In Fig. 9b, it can be found that the amount of O2 - increased rapidly with the reaction continued and reached a maximum at 60 min for KCN10/WO3(10%), which corresponded to the maximum formation rate of H2O2 during the reaction (The slope of the H2O2 formation curve was the formation rate). As time goes by, the amount of O2 - gradually decreased, which corresponded to the decreased formation rate of H2O2, and finally reached an equilibrium concentration. The result of KCN10 was the same as that of KCN10/WO3(10%), indicating that O2 - was the reaction intermediate in the process of generating H2O2 for both the composites. However, for WO3, only trace amounts of O2 - were detected due to its higher conduction band position. The change of OH in the reaction was also quantitatively determined by the salicylic acid spectrophotometry at 510 nm, as shown in Fig. 9c. Clearly, for KCN10/WO3 (10%), as the reaction continued, the amount of OH increased gradually. It was basically consistent with the change curve of production of H2O2 during the reaction, which confirmed its valence band position was positive enough to oxidize OH- to OH, and then generated H2O2. At the same time, for WO3, a certain amount of OH was also detected due to its high valence band position. Furthermore, the content of OH for KCN10/WO3 (10%) was higher than that of WO3, which may be attributed to the rapid consumption of conduction band electrons during the reaction, promoting the formation of OH. However, for KCN10, OH was not detected due to its lower valence position. Based on the results of reactive radicals trapped experiment and quantitatively determined experiment of O2 - and OH, it can be inferred that KCN10/WO3 (10%) was the Z-scheme heterojunction composite and it retained the low conduction band of KCN10 and the high valence band of WO3, which provided the two-channel pathway for photocatalytic production of H2O2. The plausible mechanism of photocatalytic was shown in Scheme 1. Under simulated sunlight irradiation, the photogenerated electrons of KCN10 and WO3 were excited simultaneously from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB). Subsequently, the photogenerated electrons in the CB of WO3 recombined with the photogenerated holes in the VB of KCN10, leaving the photogenerated electrons in the CB of KCN10 and the photogenerated holes in the VB of WO3. The holes in the VB of WO3 processed high oxidizing ability and can generate O2 and H+ by reacting with water ( Eq. (1)). Simultaneously, the electrons in the CB of KCN10 can reduce the O2 to generate O2 -, and then O2 -, H+ and e- reacted to generate H2O2 ( Eqs. (3), (4)). Besides, The oxidizing ability of holes in the VB of WO3 was high enough to oxidize the OH- in the solution to produce OH, and then further generated H2O2 (Eq. (7)). In a word, for Z-scheme heterojunction KCN10/WO3 (10%), there were two main routes to produce H2O2. The one was the one-electron two-step reaction of ox in the CB of the composite, and the other was the oxidation reaction of OH- by holes in the VB of the composite."
13,Conclusions,"In this work, the KCN10/WO3 (10%) composite was prepared successfully by doping K+ and combining WO3, which was confirmed through various characterization means. The results of EIS, PL and transient photocurrent indicated the doping K+ and combining WO3 effectively promoted carriers separation of g-C3N4. The results of reactive radicals trapped experiment and quantitatively determined experiment of O2 - and OH indicated that KCN10/WO3 (10%) was the Z-scheme heterojunction composite, which provided the two-channel pathway for photocatalytic production of H2O2. The one was the one-electron two-step reaction of O2 in the CB of the composite, and the other was the oxidation reaction of OH- by holes in the VB of the composite. The KCN/WO3(10%) composite showed the maximum photocatalytic activity and the equilibrium concentration of H2O2 was 1.33 mmol/L after 4 h, which was almost 27 times more than that of g-C3N4. In addition, the H2O2 decomposed about 1% over KCN10/WO3 (10%) after 210 min, which can be ignored under the experimental conditions. Furthermore, the photocatalyst possessed good photocatalytic recovery stability. The photocatalytic activity can reach about 94.7% even after seven times. The results indicated that the KCN10/WO3 (10%) composite was an excellent candidate for photocatalytic production of H2O2."
