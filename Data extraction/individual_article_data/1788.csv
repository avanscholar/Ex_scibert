0,Introduction,"Particulate matter (PM) is a major concern for human health, because exposure to it causes various health issues such as pulmonary and cardiovascular morbidity, and even mortality due to its toxic compositions and physicochemical properties [1–6]. Moreover, its number, size, morphology, and mass also have a strong influence on human health with chronic complications and even on the environment [7,8]. The small particles can penetrate more deeply into the lung tissue through the respiratory passageways resulting in more damaging the lung tissue compared to the large particles [7,9] (see Fig. 1 ). However, the large particles which have a major proportion of PM mass, have a strong effect on the global climate by absorbing solar radiation and reacting with other types of atmospheric constituents [10,11]. The PM emissions placed on mountains may cause melting snow and ice due to absorbing solar radiation, which may create serious problems in the environment. Also, some parts of the PM mass are soluble in water (formation of water-soluble organic carbon); therefore, they become a threat to the underwater environment and animals. Thus, some methods are required to reduce the PM emissions. Spark ignition (SI) and compression ignition (CI) engines using fossil fuels, among others, are one of the sources of PM emissions in the environment; therefore, several techniques have been applied to reduce both the emissions and the dependency on fossil fuels which have several problems, such as their depletion, price fluctuations, and escalating energy demands [12]. Fossil fuels are non-renewable, and the increase in their demand and consumption as an energy source for the future will become a serious issue. In the transportation sector, gasoline and diesel are/will be the main sources of energy in recent years/the near future (with projections to 2050) [13–17]. Therefore, it is necessary to find some solutions to reduce air pollution as well as fossil fuel consumption. Among the methods available in the literature as summarized in Fig. 2 , after-treatment systems and alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) are the most common methods which can cause significant reductions in the PM emissions [18,19]. While after-treatment systems (e.g., diesel oxidation catalysts (DOCs), diesel particulate filter (DPFs), etc.) can have positive effects on the emissions reduction side only, without reduction in fossil fuels consumption side. Also, they increase the cost of vehicles and need to be regularly checked and maintained. In regard to AFVs, there are currently several types of AFVs available on the market, such as electric, hybrid electric, fuel cell, gas, and flexible-fuel vehicles. The use of electric, hybrid electric, or fuel cell vehicles can be the best option among all the vehicles available, because the emission of electric is zero, hybrid vehicles have lower emission than conventional vehicles, and the product of fuel cell vehicles (hydrogen as the main fuel) is water. However, these vehicles have some critical drawbacks over gasoline and diesel vehicles causing less attention of people to use them. These drawbacks are their higher price and long charging time required for the batteries, and shorter driving range, as well as lack of sufficient retail charging and fueling infrastructure compared to those of gasoline or diesel vehicles [20–27]. Also, fossil fuels are currently the main source to generate electricity for these vehicles. Gas vehicles, including natural gas (both compressed natural gas and liquefied natural gas) and liquefied petroleum gas vehicles, also have critical drawbacks such as lower driving range, insufficient fueling infrastructure, safety issue for fuel (gas or liquid) storage, more fueling time required, and emission of methane compared to those of gasoline or diesel vehicles. In addition, converting a gasoline/diesel vehicle to use gas is expensive and requires significant time and specific equipment. Therefore, most of the vehicles’ owners and drivers are not interested in converting their existing gasoline or diesel vehicles to gas vehicles [20–22,28,29]. Thus, flexible-fuel vehicle can be an attractive alternative method. Because it has/use the same internal combustion engine as conventional vehicle (gasoline or diesel), while the main difference is that it is designed to run on more than one type of fuel. In flexible-fuel vehicles, alternative fuels are mostly mixed with conventional fuel (gasoline or diesel) or fumigated into the intake manifolds. The most common alternative fuels used are alcohols (particularly ethanol) for gasoline vehicles [20], and biodiesel and alcohols for diesel vehicles [12,30]. The main benefits of biodiesel and alcohols (biofuels) causing to be the interesting alternative fuels in transportation fleets are their renewability (production from edible and non-edible renewable feedstocks for biodiesel [31–37] and alcohols [12,38–42]), sustainability, and easy operation, as well as no needs for special modifications on the current traditional engines for their usage up to 20% by volume [20,43]. According to the literature as listed in Tables 1 and 2 , the impact of alcohols and biodiesel on the PM emissions in SI and CI engines, respectively have been comprehensively reviewed and it is found that these biofuels cause significant reductions in the PM emissions compared to those from fossil fuels, while no comprehensive review about the effect of alcohols on the PM emissions from CI engines can be seen. This study aims to review the PM emissions emitted from CI engines under the common types of fueling modes, including diesel, blended, and fumigation modes. In diesel mode, engines run on pure diesel fuel only. In blended mode, alcohol is mixed with diesel fuel by either the splashing method or using a fuel blender. Sometimes a co-solvent or stabilizer is used in the blended mode for preventing alcohol and diesel separation. But in fumigation mode, alcohol is injected into the intake manifolds (see Fig. 3 ), while the combustion is initiated by diesel fuel through the main fuel injection system. Generally, to reduce the amount of PM emissions or make them less detrimental to human health and the environment, it is necessary to determine their chemical properties. Since CI engines are a source of PM to the atmosphere, there is a need for more understanding about the chemical properties of PM, such as organic carbon, elemental carbon, inorganic ions, metals, elements, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and oxidation reactivity from CI engines. Carbonaceous component (total carbon, TC) is abundant material in PM emitted from CI engines. TC consists of OC and EC which are harmful to the environment and human health. OC, due to consisting of some semi-volatile hydrocarbons, is a suspected human carcinogen component [44]. On the other hand, EC has an effect on air pollution, global carbon cycles and it can absorb solar radiation resulting in energy redistribution and climate change [45–47]. Therefore, some methods are needed to reduce the OC and EC emissions from CI engines. Nowadays, there is increasing concern about the number and amount of organic compounds (e.g., PAHs and n-alkanes) in the environment, because some of the PAH compounds are highly mutagenic or carcinogenic, while benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) has been identified as a highly carcinogenic component [48–52]. The effects of different fueling modes on the PAHs and B[a]P emitted from CI engines are reviewed in this study. Internal combustion engines can produce ions due to the combustion of fuels and lubricating oil. Therefore, several studies have been conducted to determine the quantity of ions emitted from these engines and investigate the effect of using different fuels (like biofuels) on the ion concentrations [53–57]. Some trace heavy metals and elements naturally exist in the drinking water and food which have no negative impact on human health and even are essential for the body, while some of them are harmful and toxic (e.g., Pb, Zn, As, Ni, Ti, Cu, Cd, and V) [58,59]. Thus, many investigations can be found regarding the quantity of metals and elements in the atmosphere and tunnel aerosols [60–70] or PM emitted from motor vehicles [71–75]. However, there is no comprehensive information about the effects of different fueling modes on the concentrations of metals and elements emitted from CI engines using alcohols. According to the literature, many investigations have been done to utilize different types of alcohols in diesel engines. These include binary, ternary, or quaternary blends, including diesel-methanol (DM) [76–79], biodiesel-methanol (BM) [80–82], diesel-ethanol (DE) [78,79,83,84], biodiesel-ethanol (BE) [82,83,85], diesel-propanol (DPr) [86–89], biodiesel-propanol (BPr) [90], diesel-butanol (DBu) [78,91–97], biodiesel-butanol (BBu) [85,95,98–101], diesel-pentanol (DPe) [91,92,94,102,103], biodiesel-pentanol (BPe) [100,104], diesel-hexanol (DHex) [105,106], diesel-ethylhexanol (DEh) [97,107], diesel-heptanol (DHep) [101,108–110], diesel-octanol (DOc) [97,101,111–115], biodiesel-octanol (BOc) [104,116], diesel-nonanol (DNo) [117,118], diesel-decanol (DDe) [117,119], diesel-biodiesel-methanol (DBM) [120–124], diesel-biodiesel-ethanol (DBE) [125–143], diesel-biodiesel-propanol (DBPr) [144–147], diesel-biodiesel-butanol (DBBu) [95,145,148–157], diesel-biodiesel-pentanol (DBPe) [145,158–161], diesel-biodiesel-hexanol (DBHex) [162], diesel-biodiesel-heptanol (DBHep) [108], diesel-biodiesel-decanol (DBDe) [162,163], diesel-methanol-pentanol (DMPe) [102], diesel-ethanol-pentanol (DEPe) [164], diesel-ethanol-octanol (DEOc) [164], diesel-biodiesel-ethanol-butanol (DBEBu) [165], diesel-biodiesel-butanol-propanol (DBBuPr) [166], and diesel-acetone-ethanol-butanol (DAcEBu) [167,168]. Similarly, several investigations have been conducted using different types of alcohols in the fumigation mode. For instance, the fumigated alcohols tested include methanol [169–190], ethanol [191–197], propanol [169], butanol [169,198–205], heptanol [206], octanol [206,207], and nonanol [207]. In addition to the research investigations as mentioned above, various reviewed studies have summarized the results of using alcohol fuels in CI engines, as listed in Table 1. However, only the effect of alcohols on the engine combustion, performance, and emissions are mentioned in these reviewed studies, and there is almost no reviewed study available in the literature to understand comprehensively the effect of lower and higher alcohols on the physicochemical properties of PM from CI engines. On the other hand, the literature shows that several reviewed investigations have been done regarding the physicochemical properties of PM from internal combustion engines using gasoline, diesel, and biofuels, as summarized in Table 2. The physicochemical properties of PM are important parameters due to their influence on the environment, human health, and emission catalyst's efficiency. Generally, identifying the threats or new materials' properties is the first and important step for understanding and combating their issues. PM emitted from CI engines using alcohol fuels is counted as a threat to the environment and human health, while its information is necessary for designing or modifying emission catalysts. However, there is almost no comprehensive reviewed investigation to understand the impact of alcohol fuels on the physicochemical properties of PM from CI engines. Therefore, this review study tries to fill this knowledge gap. The present review aims to investigate comprehensively the impact of various types of lower and higher alcohols examined in the form of blended or fumigation mode on the PM physicochemical properties, including particle mass, total number concentration (TNC), geometric mean diameter (GMD), micro and nanostructures, organic carbon and elemental carbon, inorganic ions, metals, elements, PAHs, oxidation reactivity, and ignition temperature from CI engines under various operating conditions (see Fig. 3). Lower and higher alcohols in this review refer to their arrangement in carbon contents from C1 to C10, including methanol, ethanol, and propanol as lower alcohols and butanol, pentanol, hexanol, heptanol, octanol, nonanol, and decanol as higher alcohols, see Table 3 for their properties compared to those of diesel fuel. In addition, PM mass, number, and size are the final and important variables for the PM emissions which humans, the environment, diesel oxidation catalysts, diesel particulate filters, etc. are immediately faced upon their release from CI engine exhaust tailpipes, and several parameters have an influence on their formation which need to be understood to obtain suitable methods to combat them. Therefore, the relationship and the effect of primary particle micro and nanostructures and the PM chemical properties on PM mass, TNC, and GMD using diesel and alcohol fuels are also presented in detail in this review. The content of this review will be useful for those researchers who work on the PM emission analysis from CI engines, the effect of PM emissions emitted from CI engines on human health and the environment, and designing/modifying of emission after-treatment systems for CI engines."
1,Effect of alcohol on the physical properties of PM,"The physical properties of PM in this study refer to the PM mass, number, and size, as well as the microstructure of particles and agglomerates along with the nanostructure of primary particle as presented below in detail."
2,PM mass,"2.1 PM mass PM consists of soot and some other liquid- or solid-phase substances, while soot contributes the majority of diesel PM mass [244]. Soot, in general, is a solid substance containing carbon as a by-product of fuel combustion. Soot is mainly formed via several processes including fuel pyrolysis, nucleation, coalescence/coagulation, surface growth, agglomeration, and oxidation. The first five steps from the fuel pyrolysis to the agglomeration must be in the sequence order, while the oxidation process can happen at any time during the soot formation process [244]. Detailed information about the soot formation process is available in Refs. [18,244–246]. Other liquid- or solid-phase substances in diesel PM can be unburned or partially burned fuel and lubricant oil, metals and elements, bound water and ions (mostly sulfate) [244,247], see Fig. 4 as the schematic diagrams of the soot (PM) formation process, structure of primary particle, and composition of PM. In CI engines, most of the PMs (more than 90% of the particle number) are in the nuclei mode with a particle diameter of less than 100 nm (called ultrafine particles, more than 600 times smaller than the diameter of human hair) which typically contains 1–20% of the overall particle mass (see Fig. 5 ). Therefore, the type of fuel in use plays a significant role in the formation of PM in CI engines. Alcohol fuels, among others, have been widely investigated for use in CI engines due to their impacts on the PM properties. It can be found from Table 4 that, regardless of few exceptional cases with alcohol fumigation, the use of alcohol fuels in the blended or fumigation technique has the potential to mitigate the PM mass from CI engines under various engine and alcohol types, fuel ratios, and operating conditions (engine loads and speeds). It is because alcohol blend/fumigation has lower fuel C/H ratio, PAHs (soot precursors), and sulfur contents [248,249], and higher contents of fuel oxygen and hydroxyl group (−OH; causing the formation of hydroxyl radical (•OH) as a highly reactive component during the combustion process for the soot oxidation) [224,250] than pure diesel fuel. In addition, the longer ignition delay from alcohol fuels causes more time available for the fuel/air mixing and reduce the fuel-rich region and length of the diffusion combustion phase (favorable phase for soot and PM formation) resulting in less formation of soot and the PM emissions compared with pure diesel fuel [251–253]. Detailed information about the effect of each parameter on the PM emissions is stated in the next sections of this review."
3,PM number and size,"2.2 PM number and size It can be observed from Table 5 that, regardless of few exceptional cases with alcohol fumigation, the use of alcohols can reduce the TNC and GMD of PM emitted from various types of CI engines under various operating conditions, alcohol types, and fuel ratios. The same factors and reasons that lead to the decrease in PM mass, as mentioned before, cause reductions in TNC and GMD. In addition to those factors and reasons, since the alcohol blend/fumigation decreases the soot precursors (e.g., PAHs) and fuel C/H ratio compared to those of pure diesel fuel, the number of particles formed in the nucleation process decreases. With the decrease in particle formation in the nucleation process, the rate of other soot formation possesses including coalescence, surface growth, and agglomeration will also be reduced, resulting in the formation of less TNC and smaller GMD of PM from alcohols in comparison with PM from pure diesel fuel. Also, the fewer number of particles formed by alcohols compared with pure diesel fuel causes a reduction in the collision rate between the particles in the coalescence and agglomeration steps, leading to a reduction in GMD."
4,Microstructure of particles and agglomerates,"2.3 Microstructure of particles and agglomerates The PM sampling method is a critical factor for understanding the microstructure of particles and agglomerates and even the nanostructure of particles. Direct and in-direct PM sampling methods are available according to the literature for studying the micro and nanostructures of particles emitted from internal combustion engines. For direct PM sampling technique, a TEM grid is directly exposed to the PM sources with the use of collectors like probes which can be operated according to the thermophoresis, aerodynamic quenching, or N2-dilution principle [304–310]. In this technique, the collector can be placed in various locations to collect the PM samples, including inside the engine cylinder (as an in-flame soot sampling technique) [311–313], in the engine exhaust pipe [8,312,314], or after a dilution system [315,316]. However, the in-flame soot sampling technique has some drawbacks. For example, it is a tough task and needs more effort to locate the probe into the engine cylinder; moreover, the soot particles might not be completely formed due to the short time duration from the combustion to the TEM sampling period. Similar to the in-flame soot sampling technique, TEM sampling after a diluter also has several drawbacks. For example, the long sampling line, the time required for passing the PMs from the engine to the end of a diluter, and PM dilution with air will affect (change) the structures and shapes of the particles and the agglomerates. For in-direct PM sampling, a filter (47 mm Quartz or Teflon filter in most cases) is employed to collect PM from the engine exhaust pipe (before or after a diluter), and then the particles deposited on the filter are extracted by a solvent (e.g., ethanol or methanol). In the next step, some droplets accompanying the solvent and the particles will be placed on a TEM grid. In the final step, after drying the TEM grid, the sample will be ready for micro and nanostructures analyses [317–321]. However, this PM sampling technique has some drawbacks which affect the particles’ physicochemical properties, because particle suspension is formed in a liquid medium [322,323] and also the original (real) PM morphology cannot be observed. Since the in-flame, dilution, and filter sampling techniques have several drawbacks and deficiencies as discussed above, the direct PM sampling technique from the exhaust pipe seems to be the best method, because, through this technique, original PM morphology, particle size, and particle number concentration can be retained. In this review study, the results of both direct and in-direct PM sampling techniques are presented. The particle and agglomerate microstructure features in this review refer to the primary particle features (size and number) and the agglomerate features (radius of gyration and fractal dimension). The radius of gyration represents the agglomerate size, while the fractal dimension represents the shape of the agglomerate. A low fractal dimension shows that the agglomerate is in the form of a long chain-like structure, while a high fractal dimension shows that the agglomerate is in the form of a spherical structure [324,325]. According to Table 6 , regardless of few exceptional cases with alcohol fumigation technique that had no effect on the particle and agglomerate microstructure features, the use of alcohols can change the particle and agglomerate microstructure features by reducing the primary particle size and number, as well as the radius of gyration and the fractal dimension, compared to those of pure diesel fuel from CI engines under various engine and alcohol types, fuel ratios, and operating conditions (see Figs. 6 and 7 as examples for using ethanol (from lower alcohols' group) and hexanol (from higher alcohols’ group), respectively). Lower particles number and smaller particles size and radius of gyration obtained from alcohol fuels can support lower TNC and smaller GMD, and hence lower PM mass. Smaller fractal dimension obtained from alcohol fuels shows that the particles formed are connected to each other almost in one, two, or a few directions to form a long chain-like structure (see Fig. 6). The particle connection in a chain-like structure between the particles is not strong as that in a spherical or cluster structure (which has several connection directions as found for the particles from pure diesel fuel, see Fig. 6). Therefore, each particle has more chance and freedom for the separation from the agglomerate during the soot oxidation process, resulting in the formation of smaller GMD. It is worth mentioning that according to the results obtained from Table 4 to Table 7 and Figs. 6 and 7, regarding the same fuel concentration used in the experiments for both lower and higher alcohols, the effect of lower alcohols (methanol and ethanol) is more than higher alcohols on the changes in the PM physical properties. Because the important fuel properties (especially carbon and oxygen contents) which affect the PM formation process in lower alcohols are different, by far, from those of diesel fuel, while higher alcohols have very close fuel properties to those of diesel fuel; therefore, lower alcohols can have more impact than higher alcohols on the PM properties."
5,Nanostructure of primary particles,"2.4 Nanostructure of primary particles The literature reveals that there are several parameters that can be analyzed to understand the nanostructure of particles. These parameters include fringe length (FL), fringe tortuosity (FT), fringe separation distance (FSD), parallel stacking number, and orientation [340–351]. However, since the first three parameters are most closely related to the PM's physicochemical properties [345,351]; therefore, most of the studies available in the literature have been conducted based on them. In this review paper, the nanostructure features refer to primary particle FL, FT, and FSD. The FL shows the physical extent of the atomic carbon layer planes as well as the basal plane diameter of the particle. The FT reflects the curvature of the fringes and nanostructure disorder within the particle which is calculated as a ratio of the FL to the distance between two endpoints. The FSD shows the mean distance between the adjacent carbon layer planes [351]. The schematic of FL, FSD, and FT is presented in Fig. 8 . Several studies available in the literature as summarized in Table 7, illustrate that alcohol fuels change the nanostructure features by reducing the FL (equal to smaller graphene layer size), and increasing the FT (shows more fringes curvature and nanostructure disorder) and the FSD (shows loosely stacked carbon layers) compared to those parameters of the particles emitted from diesel fuel. It is also found that the particles' graphene layers from the primary particles of alcohol fuels have almost disordered nanostructure (e.g., fullerenic or amorphous nanostructure) compared to the primary particles from diesel fuel which have almost ordered nanostructure (e.g., graphitic nanostructure), see Figs. 9 and 10 as examples for using ethanol (from lower alcohols' group) and hexanol (from higher alcohols' group), respectively. The same factors and reasons that lead to the decreases in the microstructure features of particles and agglomerates, PM mass, TNC, and GMD as mentioned before, also cause changes in the primary particle nanostructure features. In addition to those factors and reasons, alcohol fuels reduce the soot precursors (e.g., PAHs) and fuel C/H ratio, and increase fuel oxygen and –OH (causing the formation of •OH) contents for the soot oxidation, compared to diesel fuel; therefore, smaller FL, and larger FT and FSD for primary particle from alcohol fuels are formed. Also, as the FL and the carbon layers (graphite) decrease and the FT increases, the covalent bonds between the atoms and van der Waals forces between the adjacent carbon layers will be reduced resulting in an increase in the FSD [319,332,337,352]. These reasons might be the factors that alcohol fuels can change the primary particle nanostructure features (a drop in FL and increases in FT and FSD) resulting in the formation of fullerenic or amorphous nanostructure and hence smaller GMD and thus lower PM mass. The effect of chemical PM properties such as OC-EC, ions, metals and elements, etc. on the PM emissions is discussed in the next sections."
6,Effect of alcohol on the chemical properties of PM,"The chemical properties of PM in this review refer to the PM composition (OC-EC, inorganic ions, metals, elements, and particle-phase PAHs), oxidation reactivity, and ignition temperature as presented below in detail."
7,OC-EC,"3.1 OC-EC OC and EC form TC which has a major contribution in PM mass compared with less contribution of other materials such as inorganic ions, metals, elements, etc. from CI engines, as shown in Table 8 and Fig. 11 . It can be seen from Table 9 that the use of alcohol fuels can change the percentages of TC, EC, and OC in PM compared to those of diesel fuel. Alcohol fuels have lower TC, EC, and OC concentrations but higher OC/EC ratio in comparison with those of diesel fuel from CI engines under various engine and alcohol types, fuel ratios, and operating conditions. Alcohol fuels have lower fuel C/H ratio, PAHs (soot precursors), and sulfur contents [248,249] with higher oxygen and –OH (causing the formation of •OH) contents [224,250] for the soot oxidation, in comparison with those of pure diesel fuel; therefore, they can reduce the formation of TC and especially EC. Also, free radical concentrations (such as O, •OH, etc.) available from alcohol fuels combustion increase the carbon oxidation to CO and CO2 resulting in less carbon availability for the soot precursor species formation [244,354] and hence a decrease in TC (especially EC). OC from the engine exhaust is produced mostly due to the condensation of unburned fuel as well as lubricating oil on the EC's surface and also is correlated to the hydrocarbon (HC) condensation on the exhaust particles' surfaces during the cooling and dilution processes [303]. Alcohol fuels cause reductions in HC and EC (less surface available for the condensation), and also unburned alcohols are more volatile (less participation in nucleation and condensation on the particles' surfaces during the cooling and dilution processes) compared to those of diesel fuel, therefore, they lead to less formation of OC in comparison with that of diesel fuel [303]. The higher OC/EC ratio by alcohol fuels is due to more volatile organic components as a consequence of alcohol fuels combustion and less EC content in the PM."
8,Inorganic ions,"3.2 Inorganic ions An overview on the studies as listed in Table 10 reveals that the use of alcohol fuels has the potential to reduce the quantity of inorganic ions in PM, especially sulfate which is one the most abundant components, in PM compared to the PM produced from diesel fuel. On the one hand, alcohol fuels are almost ions free, and on the other hand, diesel fuel has some ion components (due to obtaining fossil fuels from the earth which is a source of ions); therefore, alcohol fuels can reduce the PM inorganic ion concentrations compared to the PM from diesel fuel."
9,Metals and elements,"3.3 Metals and elements The major sources of metals and elements in PM emitted from CI engines can be categorized into three parts including (1) fuel, (2) organo-metallic addition into the lubricating oil, and (3) metallic engine components such as cylinder wall, rings, pistons, valve seats, etc. [72,362–365]. In the present review study, the impact of alcohol fuels on the metal and element concentrations from CI engines is investigated. Since high purity alcohols almost have no metal and element components; therefore, their usage in CI engines reduces the metal and element concentrations in the PM as can be seen in few studies as listed in Table 11 . However, as can be observed in Table 11, some studies report that the use of alcohol fuels increases the concentrations of metals and elements in PM in comparison with the PM produced by diesel fuel. The reasons might be the following points. Alcohol fuels are mostly corrosive; therefore, they have the potential to wash and remove lubricating oil (one of the major sources of metals and elements) from both the cylinder wall and the intake manifold (only during fumigation mode) when using alcohols in the blend/fumigation mode. In addition, alcohol fuels have higher oxygen concentration than diesel fuel, which can increase the lubricating oil oxidation rate during the combustion, especially at high combustion temperature [71]. According to the limited studies available in the literature, as listed in Table 11, it can be understood that the application of alcohol fuels has different effects (decrease or increase) in the PM metal and element concentrations from CI engines which is more dependent on the diesel fuel's purity, type of engine (metallic engine components), operating condition, and lubricating oil and additives, rather than solus effect of alcohol fuels application."
10,Particle-phase PAHs,"3.4 Particle-phase PAHs The particle-phase PAHs can be obtained from fuel (because of fuel aromatic content), additives, or incomplete combustion from engines (because of aromatic compounds pyrosynthesis, and unburned fuel and lubricating oil) [278,367–370]. Since the PAHs are known as one of the soot precursors, therefore, the information about the effect of different fuels (alcohol and diesel fuels) on PAHs is helpful to better study the PM emissions emitted from CI engines. Most of the PAHs investigated in the reviewed studies (Table 12 ) refer to priority 16 PAHs which are carcinogenic or probable/possible carcinogenic components as listed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) [49]. As seen from Table 12, the application of alcohol fuels can reduce the total PAHs (as well as BaPeq which is a highly carcinogenic component [49,51]) in the PM compared with the PM from diesel fuel for CI engines under various engine and alcohol types, fuel ratios, and operating conditions. It is because alcohol fuels have no PAHs contents. In addition, free radical concentrations (such as O, •OH, etc.) available from alcohol fuels combustion result in more oxidization of aromatics and reduction in PAHs growth [244]. Since alcohol fuels have reduction effects on the PAHs in the PM; therefore, they have impacts on the changes in particle micro and nanostructures and reductions in TNC, GMD, and PM mass, as mentioned before, compared to those of diesel fuel."
11,PM oxidation reactivity and ignition temperature,"3.5 PM oxidation reactivity and ignition temperature The PM (soot) oxidation reactivity is one of the most important parameters in the design of after-treatment systems such as DOCs, DPFs, etc. for reducing and trapping the PM emissions emitted from CI engines. There are many known factors (as external factors) that affect the PM oxidation reactivity [19,374] from combustion until releasing PM from exhaust pipe such as types of engine, fuel and catalyst, operating condition, residence time, temperature, etc. (which are out of the scope of this review study). However, there are some factors (as internal factors) that might also have a significant effect on the PM oxidation reactivity, especially during the combustion. These factors can be categorized into the impact of PM chemical properties (including the concentrations of OC-EC, ions, metals and element, PAHs, etc. in the fuels and PM) and PM physical properties (including micro and nanostructures of particles) on the PM oxidation reactivity [19,342,343,374–382]. According to Table 13 , the application of alcohols in the form of blended or fumigation mode can increase the PM oxidation reactivity as well as decrease the soot ignition temperature from CI engines under various engine and alcohol types, fuel ratios, and operating conditions, see Fig. 12 as an example for using ethanol (from lower alcohols' group) and butanol (from higher alcohols’ group). The reasons for the increase in the PM oxidation reactivity and the decrease in the soot ignition temperature by alcohol fuels can be the following points. In the aspect of the fuel type used, alcohol fuels have no fuel PAHs, lower fuel C/H ratio (less soot formation) and higher fuel oxygen and –OH (causing the formation of •OH) contents which can increase the PM oxidation reactivity in comparison with that of diesel fuel. It is noticeable that the impact of alcohol fuel oxygen and –OH (causing the formation of •OH) contents on the rising rate in the soot oxidation reactivity (causes decrease in soot formation) is more than the rising rate in the fuel pyrolysis process (which is the first and main process of the soot formation) [244]. In the aspect of the nanostructure of particles, as mentioned before, alcohol fuels have the potential to change the nanostructure features by reducing the FL (equal to smaller graphene layer size), and increasing the FT (shows more fringes curvature and nanostructure disorder) and the FSD (shows loosely stacked carbon layers) compared to those parameters of the particles emitted from the diesel fuel combustion. Also, the particles’ graphene layers from the primary particles of alcohol fuels have almost disordered nanostructure (e.g., fullerenic or amorphous nanostructure) compared to the primary particles from diesel fuel which have almost ordered nanostructure (e.g., graphitic nanostructure), see Fig. 9 as an example. In addition, edge carbon layers for the particles from alcohol fuels are lower in number, smaller in size, and weaker in connection than those for the particles from diesel fuel. Also, the oxygen molecules, which have a kinetic diameter of about 0.346 nm [383,384], have difficulty in entering the particles emitted from diesel fuel with the size of carbon layers and FSD of about 0.4 nm [272,325,327,332,353,376], while the use of alcohols can increase the size of carbon layers and FSD resulting in more accessibility of oxygen into the particles for the oxidation [325,385] (see Fig. 14). These parameters coupled with more availability of oxidizers (e.g., oxygen, •OH contents, etc.) for alcohol fuels, lead to increase in oxidizers accessibility into the carbon layers for the oxidation of soot, causing a rise in the PM oxidation reactivity. In addition, more curved fringe structure (higher FT) from alcohol fuels can make the C–C bonds weaker, due to reduction in electronic resonance stabilization, resulting in an increase in susceptibility for the soot oxidation [337,386] compared to the particles from diesel fuel which have resistance to the oxidation [244,245]. Fig. 13 illustrates the effect of primary particle diameter, FL, FT, and FSD on the particle activation energy for various fueling methods and operating conditions (low and high engine speeds and loads). The particle activation energy represents the PM oxidation reactivity (higher activation energy means lower oxidation reactivity). It can be observed from Fig. 13 that the reductions in primary particle diameter and FL, and the increases in FT and FSD cause an increase in the PM oxidation reactivity (decrease in particle activation energy). Similar findings with illustrative figures are also available in Refs. [387,388]. In the aspect of the microstructure of particles and agglomerates, as mentioned before, alcohol fuels cause the formation of agglomerates in a chain-like structure in which the connection between the particles is not as strong as that in spherical or cluster structure (which has several connection directions as found for particles from pure diesel fuel). Therefore, each particle has more chance and freedom for the separation from an agglomerate and hence more susceptibility for the soot oxidation. In addition, alcohol fuels lead to the formation of lower TNC and GMD than diesel fuel. These parameters cause more accessibility of oxidizers into the agglomerates and clusters and increase the PM oxidation reactivity. In the aspect of the PM chemical properties, as mentioned before, alcohol fuels reduce the TC (especially EC) and inorganic ions concentrations and increase OC/EC ratio in the PM; therefore, oxidizers can have better access to the carbon layers (in general, high EC and inorganic ions concentrations inhibit the oxygen access to the carbon layers for the particle oxidation) causing an increase in the PM oxidation reactivity from alcohol fuels in comparison with that of diesel fuel. However, the effect of metals and elements in the PM from alcohol fuels is not so clear, because alcohol fuels have both increase and decrease effects on PM metals and elements. Also, alcohol fuels reduce the PAHs in the PM causing a decrease in soot and PM (mass, number, and size) formation; therefore, soot oxidizing rate is increased (because smaller and fewer particles can be oxidized faster than larger and more particles). Other studies also reported that decreases in FL, primary particle size, agglomerate size, TNC, GMD, and EC and increases in FT, FSD, OC, volatile organic fractions, and metals and elements (Fe, Cu, and Zn) cause an increase in the PM oxidation reactivity rate and a decrease in the soot ignition temperature using diesel and alternative fuels [19,279,324,358,374,387,389–399]."
12,Summarized effects,"According to the existing literature, it is observed that many researchers from several countries use alcohols as a fuel for CI engines. The application of alcohols as a fuel in CI engines changes the PM emission properties which can have both positive and negative effects on human health, the environment, and emission after-treatment systems like DOCs, DPFs, etc. For better understanding these effects, it is necessary that researchers find how and how much the use of alcohol fuels can alter the PM emissions (especially PM physicochemical properties) compared to those reference fuel (diesel fuel, which researchers have valuable knowledge about it). Among the PM characteristics, PM mass, number, and size are the final and important variables which humans, the environment, DOCs, DPFs, etc. are immediately faced upon their release from CI engine exhaust tailpipes. While several parameters have an influence on their formation which need to be understood to obtain suitable methods to combat them. The application of alcohol fuels is one of the effective methods to mitigate the PM emissions, because they have the reduction impacts on the PM mass, number, and size via several aspects, including changes in fuel, PM physical, and PM chemical properties. Fig. 15 illustrates how fuel, PM physical, and PM chemical properties affect the PM mass, number, and size. Since the use of alcohol fuels can change the PM physicochemical properties, they have different effects compared with the PM emitted from diesel fuel on human health, the environment, and emission after-treatment systems. For instance, alcohol fuels contribute to lower PM mass, TNC, TC (especially EC), total PAHs, and BaPeq which are counted as positive effects for human health. Also, lower PM mass, TNC, GMD, and TC have positive effects on the environment and the global climate, which cause less absorption of solar radiation (e.g., melting snow and ice) and less reaction with other types of atmospheric components (e.g., formation of black rain). But the smaller GMD obtained from alcohol fuels has a negative influence on human and even animal health. Because the smaller particles can penetrate more deeply into the lung tissue through the respiratory passageways resulting in more damaging the lung tissue compared to the larger particles [7,9]. It is worth mentioning that the negative effect of smaller GMD from alcohol fuels on both human health and the environment might be compensated/ignored by their huge positive effects of the reductions in PM mass and TNC. Regarding the effect of alcohol fuels on emission after-treatment systems, lower PM mass, number, size, elemental carbon, and ignition temperature and higher PM oxidation reactivity from alcohol fuels have the potential to increase the performance and lifetime of emission catalysts, particularly DPF. The regeneration process in DPF for the oxidation (i.e., burning) of alcohol soot can be started/completed earlier (due to lower soot ignition temperature) and better (due to lower PM and EC, and higher oxidation reactivity) compared to diesel soot resulting in increases in the performance and lifetime of DPF and reductions in the DPF maintenance requirement frequency and effort. Also, the PMs from alcohols with a long chain-like structure can be more easily trapped by the filter in DPF in comparison with the spherical-shape structure of diesel PMs resulting in an improvement in the DPF performance [261,285,329,401,402]. In addition, alcohol fuels can have an effect on the reduction of backpressure in DPF due to less PM accumulation on the filter resulting in mitigate the negative impacts of backpressure such as increasing the possibility of engine and/or filter failure and dropping the fuel economy [327,402]."
13,Conclusions,"After overviewing numerous studies from the literature regarding the effects of alcohol fuels (up to 30% by volume, as tested in most studies) on the PM emissions in CI engines under various conditions, the following main conclusions can be drawn. • Both lower and higher alcohols significantly change the PM compositions and structures resulting in an average reduction from different conditions by about 50% in PM mass, 60% in PM number (TNC), and 30% in PM size (GMD), while regarding the same level of alcohol usage (by volume or mass), lower alcohols, particularly methanol and ethanol, have more effect than higher alcohols on the PM reduction. Because lower alcohols have differences in their properties which significantly affect the PM formation (especially less carbon and more oxygen contents) compared with those properties of higher alcohols. • Alcohols in blended format have more effect than in fumigation format on the PM reduction, especially at the low engine temperature working period (i.e., low speed or torque). Because at low engine temperature working period, the low temperature combustion coupling higher latent heat of evaporation of fumigated alcohols cause the formation of poor combustion. Also, some fumigated alcohol droplets can travel into the low temperature quenching regions in combustion chamber walls/crevices resulting in the formation of unburned fuels. And the unburned fuels will enter the exhaust pipe and then be condensed resulting in more PM formation. Moreover, the application of low fuel injection pressure for alcohol fumigating causes the formation of large alcohol droplets resulting in less chance for their complete burning causing more PM formation. • Since alcohols generate lower PM mass, number, size, elemental carbon (by about −60%), and ignition temperature (by about −8%) and higher PM oxidation reactivity (by about 30%) compared to those of diesel fuel, they have the potential to increase the performance and lifetime of emission catalysts, particularly DPF. To sum up, until the full adoption of non-fossil and zero-emission vehicles (e.g., electric vehicles) in the current transportation fleets in the future (which is an unclear time), the combination of alcohol fuels (especially lower alcohols) and emission catalysts can be an effective method to reduce both fossil fuel consumption and PM emissions, simultaneously, and thereby improving the performance and lifetime of emission catalysts."
