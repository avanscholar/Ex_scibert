0,Introduction,"In response to the twin threats posed by global warming and the finite nature of petro-based sources, Renewable Energy Systems (RES) have gained a significant foothold in the world energy mix. However, as the transport sector remains heavily reliant on fossil fuels (<97%), concerted efforts are under way to promote the use of biofuels [1]. The European Parliament for example has mandated that at a minimum, 10% of transport energy consumption should be derived by biofuels by 2020 [2]. Biodiesel production has risen from 10% of total biofuel output in 2005, to almost 25% in 2015 [3]. This growth is expected to continue in to the future (albeit at a slower pace), with estimates suggesting that biodiesel production will reach 41 Mm3 in 2022 [4]. However, the sector’s positive progress also requires that crude glycerol, the main byproduct of the transesterification reaction (10 wt% of the oil undergoing the reaction) must be utilised in an economic and environmentally sustainable manner [5,6]. A likely solution is the conversion of glycerol into hydrogen, a carbon-free energy source with the potential to play a vital role in the future energy mix. This can be achieved via a variety of thermochemical processes, which include pyrolysis, aqueous phase reforming (APR), autothermal reforming (ATR), super critical water reforming (SCWR), partial oxidation reforming (POR), sorption enhanced steam reforming (SESR), chemical looping steam reforming (CLSR), dry reforming (DR) and steam reforming (SR) [7–9]. Steam reforming has the advantage of being a mature industrial technology, which means that switching feedstock is likely to require relatively few technical adjustments [10]. Moreover, the reaction stoichiometry shows that the process also has a high H2 production capacity per mol of glycerol reformed (Eq. (1)). The thermodynamic studies that have been undertaken for the glycerol steam reforming (GSR) set the upper limit to 6.2 mol of H2/mol of C3H8O3, which can be achieved at temperatures higher than 630 °C (GSR is a strongly endothermic reaction with ΔΗ Θ = 123 kJ/mol), at water to glycerol feed ratio (WGFR) higher that 9:1 (molar) and atmospheric pressure [11,12]. GSR (Eq. (1)) is in essence a combination of glycerol decomposition (Eq. (2)) and the water-gas shift reaction (WGS, Eq. (3)). The decomposition of glycerol takes places at temperatures higher than 300 °C and involves a number of parallel and consecutive steps such as dehydration, dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, isomerisation, polymerization and cleavage of the C–C and C–O bonds [13,14]. Additional reactions that may occur during the GSR include methanation (Eq. (4)), methane dry reforming (Eq. (5)) and carbon formation reactions (Eqs. (6)-(9)) [15,16]. Moreover, the intermediates and by-products formed during the reaction may also react, further complicating the process [17,18]. (1) C3H8O3 + 3H2O → 3CO2 + 7H2 (2) C3H8O3 → 3CO + 4H2 (3) CO + H2O ↔ CO2 + H2 (4) CO + 3H2 ↔ CH4 + H2O (5) CH4 + CO2 ↔ 2H2+ 2CO (6) 2CO ↔ CO2 + C (7) CH4 ↔ 2H2 + C (8) H2O + C ↔ CO + H2 (9) C3H8O3 → H2+3H2O+3C An effective GSR catalyst needs to promote the cleavage of the C–C, O–H and C–H bonds, and eliminate the metal-passivating carbon monoxide via the WGS reaction. This means that the catalyst used should also inhibit the C–O cleavage and the CO or CO2 hydrogenation, the occurrence of which will lead to the formation of alkanes and/or more polar compounds [19,20]. Most efforts found in the literature have focused on the development of Ni catalysts based on a variety of supports [21,22]. This is because Ni is relatively cheap and exhibits excellent intrinsic activity when well dispersed on to the support [23,24]. However, these systems are also susceptible to carbon deposition leading to their eventual deactivation during time-on-stream (TOS) [25,26]. Although Rh based catalysts have been heavily studied in the steam reforming of ethanol, due to their high C–C bond breaking activity and resistance to carbon deposition [27,28], reports on the performance of Rh systems on the GSR are few and far between [29–33]. Adhikari et al. [29] applied commercial alumina ceramic foam monolith as support for Rh/Al, Pt/Al, Pd/Al, Ir/Al, Ru/Al, Ni/Al, Ce/Al, Rh/CeAl, Pt/CeAl, Pd/CeAl, Ir/CeAl, Ru/CeAl and Ni/CeAl catalysts (Metal loading = 2.5 wt%). However, the catalysts were not activated prior to reaction resulting in poor glycerol conversion and H2 selectivity. Chiodo et al. [30] compared the performance of Rh/Al (Rh = 5 wt%), Ni/Al (Ni = 30 wt%), Ni/MgO (Ni = 21 wt%) and Ni/CeO2 (Ni = 30 wt%) catalysts prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. The catalysts were calcined at 400 °C and reduced at 800 °C under a flow of pure H2. During experiments, carried out at 800 °C for 20 h using a steam to carbon ratio (S/C) of 3.0 mol/mol and a GHSV of 30,000 h−1, all catalysts showed significant deactivation within the first 2 h. Nonetheless, the Rh/Al catalyst showed the best performance both in terms of H2 yield and stability. The authors also asserted that the presence of Rh had an inhibiting effect on coke formation. Araque et al. [31] prepared fluorite mixed oxide CeZr, CeZrCo, CeZrRh and CeZrCoRh catalysts using the pseudo sol-gel method. Catalysts were calcined at 700 °C and reduced at 450 °C under mild conditions (i.e., 3 ml/min of H2 for 12 h). TOS experiments were conducted for 24 h, at 650 °C, using a WGFR of 9:1 (molar) and a WHSV of 60,000 ml g−1 h−1. Despite the fact that the Rh containing catalysts had an improved performance in comparison to the other samples, the authors observed a rather steep deactivation after approximately 5 h; for the best performing catalyst, CeZrCoRh, H2 yield dropped from an initial value of ≈6.0 to ≈1.5 mol of H2/mol of C3H8O3. The authors also concluded that the presence of Rh led to reduced carbon deposition. Senseni et al. [32,33] investigated the performance of Rh, Ru, Pt and Ir (1 wt% of active metal) supported on modified alumina with MgO (Mg/Al molar ratio = 7). After calcination at 450 °C, catalysts were reduced at 450 °C under a flow of 30 ml/min of H2 for 5 h. Catalytic performance was evaluated between 300 and 600 °C at a WGFR equal to 9:1 (molar) and a WHSV of 35,000 ml g−1 h−1. The authors reported that the Rh catalyst had the highest glycerol conversion and H2 selectivity (almost 100% for both metrics at 600 °C) and that it showed excellent stability during 5 h of TOS experiments. Carbon deposition was studied using TPO, and for the Rh/MgAl catalysts, the peaks identified were below 500 °C, which corresponded to the oxidation of mainly amorphous carbon. It is well understood that in steam reforming reactions, the nature of the support affects the selectivity of the catalyst because it activates the dissociation of water into hydroxyl groups and promotes the migration of these species toward the metal particles, where formation of COx and hydrogen takes place [34]. Thermal stability and ability to promote catalytic dispersion are also sought properties in supports [35]. In the GSR, alumina is a ubiquitous support because it has high surface area and excellent thermal and chemical stability at high temperatures [10,24]. Nonetheless, the surface acidity of Al2O3 promotes carbon deposition and thus, catalyst deactivation [17,22]. Hence, different oxides have been used as modifiers of the physical and chemical properties of alumina. CeO2 has been reported to offer higher reducibility in the presence of noble metals [28], improve the dispersion of the active phase [36], prevent the sintering of metallic particles [16] and reduce the formation of coke due to its oxygen storage/release ability [37]. La2O3 has been reported to prevent deactivation by the formation of oxycarbonate species (La2O2CO3), which can react with the deposited carbon at the Ni–La2O3 interface by means of coke oxidation [37] and enhance the dispersion of active particles [19]. The use of CaO and MgO as alumina modifiers has been shown to reduce nickel species crystallite size, increase catalyst basicity and lead to a redistribution of the acid sites in terms of strength and density [23]. In addition to the chemical composition, the synthesis method is also an important issue to prepare highly active and stable reforming catalysts. Compared with traditional synthesis methods, the template approach can effectively produce catalysts with high specific surface area and improved catalytic behaviour by using a surfactant in the precipitation process [38–40]. Indeed, the use of surfactants (organic structure-directing agents) controls the morphology, particle size, and nano/microstructure of the precipitated materials [41,42]. In our previous study, we synthesized high surface area Al2O3 (375 m2/g) and CeO2–Al2O3 (299 m2/g) mesoporous supports by using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as the cationic surfactant [43]. In this work, Rh-based catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 modified with CeO2, MgO or La2O3, were synthesized by coupling the surfactant-assisted co-precipitation method and the wet impregnation technique. This is the first time that this particular technique is used for the preparation of catalysts that were tested for the GSR. The physico-chemical properties of the prepared catalysts were intensively characterized by N2-physisorption, XRD, ICP-AES, CO-chemisorption, TEM, H2-TPR, CO2-TPD and NH3-TPD measurements. The carbon deposited on their surface under reaction conditions was characterized by TEM. Catalytic performance aimed at investigating the effect of the reaction temperature on: (i) Glycerol total conversion, (ii) Glycerol conversion to gaseous products, (iii) Hydrogen selectivity and yield, (iv) Selectivity of gaseous products, and (v) Selectivity of liquid products. The stability of the samples was tested at relatively low WGFR in order to help provoke catalyst deactivation. Quantitative results are provided when reporting on the liquid products."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Technical grade aluminium nitrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O), ammonium cerium nitrate ((NH4)2Ce(NO3)6), magnesium nitrate (Mg(NO3)2·6H2O), lanthanum nitrate (La(NO3)3·6H2O), rhodium nitrate (Rh(NO3)3·xH2O) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Germany). All aqueous solutions were prepared with ultrapure deionized water (Millipore Milli-Q system with resistivity >18 MΩ cm)."
3,Catalysts synthesis,"2.2 Catalysts synthesis Al2O3, and 10 wt% MeOx-Al2O3 (Me = Ce, Mg, La) supports were synthesized by the surfactant-assisted co-precipitation method, as previously reported [38,43]. Metal nitrates were used as metal precursors, while CTAB was used as the cationic surfactant. In a typical procedure, the solution containing metal salts at fixed metal (Al + Me) concentration of 0.085 M was heated up to 90 °C under continuous stirring. Then, the CTAB surfactant was also added in metals solution with (Al + Me)/CTAB molar ratio of 1.2. After stirring for 0.5 h at 90 °C, an ammonia solution was added dropwise until the pH value of the mixture reached 10 ± 0.2. The obtained suspension was further stirred at 90 °C for 48 h. The final precipitate was filtered, washed with distilled water, dried at 120 °C for 12 h, and subsequently calcined in a static air furnace at 600 °C (heating rate of 3 °C·min−1) for 2 h. The synthesized supports were indicated as Al2O3, 10CeO2–Al2O3, 10MgO–Al2O3 and 10La2O3–Al2O3. Then, the 0.5 wt% Rh-based catalysts were prepared by the wetness impregnation technique with an aqueous solution of rhodium precursor. After impregnation, each sample was dried at 120 °C and calcined at 800 °C (heating rate of 3 °C·min−1) for 2 h. The obtained catalysts were denoted as Rh/Al2O3, Rh/10CeO2–Al2O3, Rh/10MgO–Al2O3, Rh/10La2O3–Al2O3. Table 1 lists the main physico-chemical characteristics of all the pure supports and rhodium-impregnated materials investigated in this study."
4,Catalysts characterization,"2.3 Catalysts characterization N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were obtained on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument at liquid nitrogen temperature (−196 °C). The specific surface area and pore volume were evaluated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods, respectively. The samples were degassed by heating at 300 °C under vacuum for 6 h before the measurement. The crystal structure of the samples was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique using a Philips X-Pert 3710 diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source, operating at 40 kV and 20 mA. Diffractograms were recorded in the 2θ = 20°–75° range (0.4°·min−1). The diffraction patterns were identified by comparison with the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) cards. The chemical composition of the final catalysts was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) on an Agilent 725 ICP-OES (inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer). CO-chemisorption measurements were carried out at room temperature on a Micromeritics ChemiSorb 2750 instrument equipped with a Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD) [44]. Catalyst was reduced under H2 flow (30 NmL·min−1) at 800 °C for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, it was i) oxidized under pure O2 flow (30 NmL·min−1) for 10 min; iii) treated under CO2 flow (30 Nml·min−1) for 10 min and iv) reduced under pure H2 flow (30 Nml·min−1) for 30 min. Then, a mixture of 10% CO in He was injected in pulses of 600 NμL each, until the fulfilment of constant outlet peaks. The rhodium dispersion (DRh) was calculated from the amount of chemisorbed CO, through the equation D Rh = f CO/Rh ·V CO /22414·M Rh /L Rh , where fCO/Rh (=1) is the stoichiometric factor for CO chemisorption, VCO (NmL·gcat −1) is the volume of CO chemisorbed on Rh, MRh (=102.91 g mol−1) is the molar mass of Rh, LRh (=0.005) is the Rh content in the catalyst. Temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiments were performed on the same apparatus by flowing 30 NmL·min−1 of 5% H2/Ar from ambient temperature up to 800 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C·min−1. Before the experiments, samples were heat treated under O2 flow (30 Nml·min−1) at 300 °C for 1 h. The hydrogen consumption was monitored by a TCD detector and the response was quantitatively calibrated from the H2-TPR area of known amounts of CuO. The basicity of reduced catalysts was evaluated by temperature programmed desorption of carbon dioxide (CO2-TPD) pre-adsorbed at room temperature. The samples were reduced under H2 flow (30 NmL·min−1) at 800 °C for 1 h and exposed to CO2 stream (30 NmL·min−1) at room temperature for 30 min. Finally, the physisorbed CO2 was removed by He purging (30 NmL·min−1) at room temperature for 1 h. Then, the temperature was increased up to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C·min−1 and the desorbed CO2 was monitored by TCD, which was previously calibrated by injections of CO2 pulses. The acidity of reduced catalysts was evaluated by temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) pre-adsorbed at 100 °C. The samples were reduced under H2 flow (30 NmL·min−1) at 800 °C for 1 h and exposed to 5% NH3/He (30 NmL·min−1) at 100 °C for 1 h. Finally, the gaseous and weakly adsorbed ammonia were removed by a steady flow of He (30 NmL·min−1) at 100 °C for 1 h. Then, the temperature was increased up to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C·min−1 and the desorbed NH3 was monitored by TCD, which was previously calibrated by injections of NH3 pulses. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out using a 200 kV G2 20 S-Twin Tecnai microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, USA) with a LaB6 electron source fitted with a “SuperTwin®” objective lens allowing a point to point resolution of 0.24 nm. To prepare the samples for transmission electron microscopy studies, catalyst powder was dispersed in Milli-Q water. After 30 s in an ultrasonic bath, a drop of this suspension was applied to a copper grid (200 mesh) coated with carbon film, and allowed to dry in air. To prepare the sample, the nanoparticle suspension was diluted with ethanol and sonicated for 30 s before the casting of 5 μL on a carbon TEM grid."
5,Catalytic tests,"2.4 Catalytic tests The GSR was carried out in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor at atmospheric pressure. The experimental set up has been described in detail previously [e.g. 14,15]. Briefly, the experimental set up used allowed the feeding of both liquid and gaseous streams, having two vaporizers and a pre-heater before the reactor and a condenser after it. The vaporizers, pre-heater and reactor were placed into electrical ovens and regulated with programmed-temperature controllers. The reactor’s outlet gases passed through a cold trap for liquid products capture. The glycerol used had 99.5% purity and was supplied by Sigma Aldrich. Catalytic activation was carried out in situ (prior to catalytic testing), under a flow (100 Nml min−1) of high purity H2 (5.0) at 800 °C for 1 h. Catalytic activity and selectivity was assessed in the temperature range of 400–750 °C (experimental protocol #1) using an aqueous solution of 0.12 Nml min−1 (20 v.v. % C3H8Ο3 in H2O) and a gas stream of 38 Nml min−1 of He (99.999%). Thus, the gas feed at the reactor’s inlet consisted of a gas mixture of 73% H2O, 4% C3H8O3 and 23% He. The Weight Hourly Space Velocity (WHSV) used was 50,000 NmL g−1 h−1 and measurements were taken at 50 °C steps. Catalytic stability (experimental protocol #2) was assessed at 600 °C using a higher concentration of glycerol in the liquid stream, set at 31 v.v. % C3H8Ο3 (63% H2O, 7% C3H8O3, 30% He), but the WHSV was kept at 50,000 NmL g−1 h−1. TOS experiments were undertaken for a 12 h period and gaseous products were measured every hour, while liquid products every 4 h. The liquid products were analyzed via a combination of Gas Chromatography (Agilent 7890A) and Mass Spectroscopy (Agilent 5975C). The gaseous products were determined via an Agilent gas chromatographer (7890A). Detailed information regarding the analysis of liquid and gaseous products can be found at ref. [21]."
6,Reaction metrics,"2.5 Reaction metrics The investigation of catalytic performance necessitated the calculation of the total glycerol conversion, the conversion of glycerol into gaseous products, the determination of the H2 yield and selectivities to H2, CH4, CO2 and CO. For the calculations Eq. (10) - (14) shown below were used. The selectivity to acetone [(CH3)2CO], acetaldehyde (C2H4O), acetol (C3H6O2), allyl alcohol (CH2 CHCH2OH), acrolein (C3H4O) and acetic acid (C2H4O) was calculated based on Eq. (15): (10) % g l y c e r o l c o n v e r s i o n ( g l o b a l c o n v e r s i o n ) = ( G l y c e r o l i n − G l y c e r o l o u t G l y c e r o l i n ) × 100 (11) % g l y c e r o l c o n v e r s i o n ( g a s e o u s p r o d u c t s ) = ( C a t o m s i n t h e g a s p r o d u c t s t o t a l C a t o m s i n t h e f e e d s t o c k ) × 100 (12) H 2 y i e l d = H 2 m o l p r o d u c e d m o l o f g l y c e r o l i n t h e f e e d s t o c k (13) % H 2 selectivity = ( H 2 m o l produced C atoms produced in the gas phase ) × ( 1 R R ) × 100 where, RR is defined as the ratio of mol of Η2 to CO2 formed, i.e., the reforming ratio (7/3).

7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of samples,"3.1 Characterization of samples 3.1.1 Textural properties Fig. 1 shows the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and the pore size distribution for the Rh-based catalysts and their corresponding supports. For all samples, the isotherms could be classified as type IV according to the IUPAC classification (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry), which is characteristic of mesoporous materials [45,46]. The hysteresis loop of type H2 was associated to capillary condensation taking place in mesopores with neck-bottle shape (Fig. 1a,c) [43,47]. In addition, the appearance of the hysteresis loop at high relative pressure (p/p0 > 0.7) suggested a broad pore size distribution, as revealed in Fig. 1b and c, evidencing the majority of the population of pores in the meso-range with some macroporosity [48,49]. The textural properties (specific surface area, pore volume and average pore diameter) of the synthesized samples are summarized in Table 1. Remarkably high specific surface area values ranging between 167 and 251 m2 g−1 were obtained for all the supports calcined at 600 °C, following the order 10La2O3–Al2O3 (167) < 10CeO2–Al2O3 (227) < Al2O3 (237) < 10MgO–Al2O3 (251 m2 g−1). It can be noticed that the introduction of the La2O3 promoter produced significant changes in the textural properties of the Al2O3 support. Indeed, the 10La2O3–Al2O3 support showed the lowest specific surface area value (Table 1), due to the coverage of the small pore walls of the Al2O3 with La2O3 oxide species, as previously reported [50,51]. This phenomenon was in agreement with the increase of the average pore diameter from ca. 13 nm (Al2O3) to 18 nm (Table 1, Fig. 1b). After the addition of 0.5 wt% Rh a substantial reduction in the specific surface area of all the supports (Table 1) was observed. Specific surface area values ranging between 119 and 184 m2 g−1 were determined for Rh/10La2O3–Al2O3 and Rh/10MgO–Al2O3, respectively. Considering the low Rh loading (0.5 wt%), the decrease in surface area could be attributed mostly to the second calcination step at higher temperature (800 °C). It can also be observed that the pore size distribution shifted to larger sizes (Fig. 1d) as well as the average pore diameter increased to higher values (Table 1) due to thermal sintering of the synthesized catalysts [52]. 3.1.2 X-ray diffraction and ICP-OES characterization Fig. 2 a shows X-ray diffraction patterns of the supports calcined at 600 °C. For the undoped Al2O3 support, very broad diffraction peaks appeared at 2θ = 31.96°, 37.63°, 39.52°, 45.90°, 60.95° and 67.09° (JCPDS 10–0425), which can be associated with the presence of cubic γ-Al2O3 phase [53,54]. The high degree of broadness of the observed peaks indicated the fine nature and the lower degeneracy in the crystallites [55]. Quite similar profile was observed for the 10MgO–Al2O3 support, exhibiting lines only attributable to the poorly crystalline γ-Al2O3 phase (Fig. 2a). This is not surprising as Mg ions exists in atomic dispersion over alumina carrier for loading up to 14.5 wt% of MgO, as previously reported by Jiang et al. [56]. Otherwise, the CeO2–Al2O3 system showed the characteristic peaks at 2θ = 28.55°, 33.08°, 47.49° and 56.33° (JCPDS 04–0593) which could be indexed to (111), (220) and (311) crystal planes of the face-centered cubic CeO2 [57–59]. Moreover, the La2O3–Al2O3 support showed the crystallographic diffraction peaks of lanthanum oxide bromide (JCPDS 16–0783) attributable to the bromination of the La2O3 during the surfactant-assisted co-precipitation synthesis in which cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was used as the cationic surfactant [60,61] (Fig. 2a). Fig. 2b show the X-ray diffraction patterns of the Rh-based catalysts calcined at 800 °C and subsequently reduced at 800 °C. In all systems, the intensity of the observed reflection increased compared to corresponding supports; this indicated that the crystallite size of the detected species increased, due to the thermal sintering at higher temperature (800 °C), as confirmed by N2 physisorption results (Table 1). Moreover, no diffraction peaks due to Rh could be detected, with the exception of the Rh/La2O3–Al2O3 catalyst, indicating the high dispersion of Rh species on the surface of the Al2O3, CeO2–Al2O3 and MgO–Al2O3 supports. New diffraction peaks of AlLaO3 (JCPDS 09–0072) appeared in the pattern of the Rh/La2O3–Al2O3. AlLaO3 was formed by the solid phase interaction at high temperature between Al2O3 and La2O3, according to literature results [50,62,63]. The actual chemical composition of fresh catalysts, measured by ICP-OES characterization, showed general agreement between the theoretical and experimental composition (Table 1). 3.1.3 Reducibility, dispersion and crystal size Fig. 3 shows the TPR profiles of Rh-based catalysts. The reduction profile of Rh/Al2O3 showed a peak at ca. 140 °C assigned to the reduction of Rh2O3 to metallic Rh [64]. The relative hydrogen consumption (0.07 mmolH2·g−1) was slightly lower than that required for the complete reduction of Rh2O3 to metallic Rh, according to the chemical composition of the tested material (0.5 wt%), leading to a reduction degree of 94.9%. With the addition of CeO2, two broad reduction peaks appeared between 300 and 800 °C, related to the reduction of CeO2 surface oxygen and CeO2 bulk oxygen, respectively [65,66]. The reduction profile of pure CeO2 prepared by surfactant assisted precipitation method was characterized by two consecutive reduction steps at 600 and 900 °C, as previously reported [43]. A shift in the position of surface CeO2 reduction peak to lower temperatures (400 °C) was indicative of the existence of strong interactions between Rh and CeO2 phases [67]. Indeed, metallic Rh favours the dissociative chemisorption of H2, followed by spillover of H species which promotes the reduction of Ce4+ at the surface of the support [68]. The addition of MgO does not modify the reduction profile of Rh/Al2O3, even if a broad peak appeared at 400 °C, which could be assigned to Rh2O3 species strongly interacted with magnesium oxide [69]. Moreover, the peak ascribed to the reduction of Rh2O3 slightly shifted to higher temperature for both Rh/CeO2–Al2O3 (149 °C) and Rh/MgO–Al2O3 (152 °C) catalysts, due to the higher metal-support interaction provided by the adopted synthesis method [38,70,71]. A different profile was recorded for the Rh/La2O3–Al2O3 catalyst for which two main peak at 370 and 460 °C were observed. Osorio-Vargas et al. [51] reported that modification of Rh/Al2O3 catalyst with La2O3 shifted the Rh2O3 reduction peak to higher temperature, suggesting that La2O3 stabilized Rh2O3 species towards reduction. Thus, the observed peaks could be attributed to the reduction of Rh oxide particles in intimate contact with AlLaO3 phase, in accordance with XRD results [51,72]. In addition, the XRD analysis evidenced the presence of hardly reducible LaOBr species (Fig. 2) [73]. Therefore, the reduction of La-oxybromide species, overlapping the Rh2O3 reduction peak, cannot be excluded. The Rh dispersion and particle size calculated by CO-chemisorption are summarized in Table 1. The Rh dispersion over Al2O3 was 26.5%, while it increased to 29.9 and 34.3% by adding 10 wt% of MgO and CeO2, respectively. Contrarily, a slight lower Rh dispersion was revealed for the Rh/La2O3–Al2O3 (19.4%) catalyst, which was consistent with the decrease in specific surface area of the La2O3–Al2O3 support. Rh particle size in the range 3.2–5.7 nm were determined (Table 1). TEM images of the reduced catalysts and the corresponding particle size distribution histograms are presented in Fig. 4 a and confirm that very small Rh particle sizes have been achieved, especially for the modified samples (mean sizes from 1.4 to 1.7 nm). For the Rh/Al2O3 catalyst, a mean size of 1.9 nm for the smaller particles and 16.4 nm for the larger particles was calculated (Table 1). Moreover, the TEM images presented herein show that the void structure (pores) have approximately the same dimension with the one highlighted for the pore size distribution in Fig. 1. 3.1.4 Acid-base properties The surface basicity of the Rh-based catalysts was investigated by temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of CO2 and the profiles are shown in Fig. 5 a. It is observed that all desorption curves are mainly characterized by the presence of a low temperature peak located at ca. 70 °C and a broad contribution at the temperature range of 140–400 °C, corresponding to two types of basic site, i.e. weak and medium basic sites, respectively [74,75]. Moreover, TPD profiles did not evidence the presence of strong basic sites (>400 °C) on the catalyst surface. Quantitative results are summarized in Table 2 , evidencing a higher contribution of the weak basic sites for all the studied systems [76]. It can be also seen that the addition of metal oxides (CeO2, MgO, La2O3) to the γ-Al2O3 support led to an increase in basicity, due to a greater concentration of both weak and medium basic sites. Indeed, the overall CO2-uptake followed the trend Rh/Al2O3 (81.5) < Rh/MgO–Al2O3 (126.5) ≈ Rh/La2O3–Al2O3 (143.3) < Rh–CeO2–Al2O3 (165.8 μmol CO2·g−1), as shown in Table 2. Similar CO2-TPD profile for Al2O3 was reported by Boukha et al. [76], consisting of a major desorption peak at approximately 120 °C with a total amount of desorbed CO2 of 70 μmol CO2·g−1. The authors proved that the addition of La2O3 increased the total basicity of the alumina [76]. Li et al. [77] showed the CO2 desorption profile of MgO/Al2O3 system, characterized by three kind of basic sites with different strength. In that work, the adsorbed species formed from CO2 on MgO/Al2O3 were identified by IR analysis and attributed to the formation of bicarbonate, bidentate and unidentate species for weak, medium and strong basic sites, respectively. Accordingly, the basicity measured in this study can be mainly attributed to the formation of carbonate and bidentate species on the catalyst surface. The total acidity of the catalysts was analyzed by temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3 and the profiles obtained for the Rh-based catalysts are shown in Fig. 5b. The total concentration of acid sites was given in Table 2 as the amount of ammonia desorbed per gram of catalyst. Additionally, the strength of the acid sites was determined considering the sites retaining NH3 at temperature lower than 300 °C as weak acid sites. Besides, the medium and strong acid sites were considered as the sites retaining the NH3 at temperature comprised between 300 and 500 °C and higher than 500 °C, respectively (Fig. 5b) [71,78]. Rh/Al2O3 system showed an asymmetric desorption peak with a maximum at ca. 250 °C and a long tail which extended to temperatures higher than 500 °C. Although by NH3-TPD measurements is not possible to discriminate between Lewis and Brønsted acidity, the interpretation of the low temperature desorption peak (<300 °C) is generally associated to the presence of Lewis acid sites while the high temperature desorption peak (>500 °C) is usually ascribed to the presence of Brønsted acid sites [51,79]. The absence of a desorption peak in the high temperature region of Rh/Al2O3 catalyst confirmed the absence of Brønsted acidity, while the tail could be attributed to the presence of Lewis acid sites with different strength [51,80,81]. In quantitative terms (Table 2), Rh/Al2O3 disclosed a similar fraction of weak (0.28), medium (0.34) and strong sites (0.25), with an uptake of 0.87 mmolNH3·g−1. When different metal oxides (CeO2, MgO, La2O3) were added to the Al2O3 support, the concentration of acid sites decreased, following the order: Rh/Al2O3 (0.87) > Rh/CeO2–Al2O3 (0.76) ≈ Rh/MgO–Al2O3 (0.71) > Rh/La2O3–Al2O3 (0.37 mmolNH3·g−1). From these data it is evident that acidity of Al2O3 surface slightly decreased with addition of CeO2 (ca. 14%) and MgO (ca. 18%), due to a lower contribution of the weak acid sites. The addition of La2O3 led to a more pronounced decrease in acidity (ca. 57%). As reported by Mazumder and de Lasa [50], this significant reduction in acidity may be due to the decreased surface area of the Rh/La2O3–Al2O3 system (Table 1) as well as the formation of AlLaO3 species, as evidenced by XRD analysis (Fig. 2)."
9,Catalytic performance,"3.2 Catalytic performance 3.2.1 Total conversion and conversion to gaseous products The results obtained during experimental protocol #1 in regards to total glycerol conversion (XC3H8O3, %) and glycerol conversion to gaseous products (XC3H8O3 into gaseous products, %) are shown for the supports in Fig. 6 a and for the catalysts in Fig. 6b. It is apparent that the total conversion of glycerol was very high for both supports (from ≈70% at 400 °C to ≈80% at 750 °C) and catalysts (from ≈75% at 400 °C to ≈90% at 750 °C) for the entire temperature range. Notably, for the Rh/Al2O3 sample, the total conversion of glycerol remained almost constant at ∼90%. It is also apparent that the catalytic samples exhibited an improved performance in terms of glycerol’s conversion to gaseous products when compared with the supports, especially for 450 °C < T < 600 °C; both supports and catalysts seemed to reach a plateau at 650 °C. Amongst the catalysts tested herein, the Rh/Al2O3 appeared to be more selective to gaseous products, showing a sharp increase between 450 and 600 °C. In contrast, the Rh/MgO–Al2O3 was the least selective catalyst. Amongst supports, the highest amount of gaseous products was produced by CeO2–Al2O3 and the lowest by MgO–Al2O3. The increasing trend with temperature of glycerol conversion to gaseous products observed for all samples tested herein is explained by the endothermic nature of the GSR reaction. At lower temperatures, the steam reforming reaction was limited as other reactions such as water gas shift and methanation were more dominant [22,24]. Nevertheless, at higher temperatures, the metal loaded catalysts provided higher conversion values compared to the supports. This is consistent with findings in the literature reporting that active metal sites enhance the cleavage of C–C or C–O bonds in glycerol molecules through dehydrogenation on active metal sites [21]. Thus, a synergistic effect between Rh and the basic sites of the supports could be responsible for the improved catalytic performance of all catalytic samples [82]. The poor catalytic performance of Rh/MgO–Al2O3 and Rh/CeO2–Al2O3 catalysts may be due to a partial coverage of the Rh particles by the support, a phenomenon reported for a Ru/MgAl2O4 and a Rh/CeO2 catalyst [83,84]. 3.2.2 Gaseous products selectivity The selectivity towards gaseous products in relation to temperature, i.e., H2 selectivity (SH2) and yield (YH2), selectivity to carbonaceous gaseous products’ (SCO2 and SCO), and H2/CO and CO/CO2 molar ratios for all samples is presented in Figs. 7–9 . All catalytic samples exhibited a higher production of H2 in comparison to the supports for the whole temperature range, with their SH2 and YH2 taking values close to the thermodynamically predicted ones, i.e. 80-97% and 5.0–6.0 mol/mol, respectively (Fig. 7). Interestingly, the Rh/Al2O3 catalyst revealed the highest H2 selectivity and yield values among all catalysts, especially for the high T range (550–750 °C). Concerning SCO2 and SCO values (Fig. 8), it can be observed that supports were more selective towards CO and less selective towards CO2 for the whole temperature range with CeO2–Al2O3 showing the highest SCO2 and lowest SCO values. The same observation, i.e., higher selectivity towards CO and lower selectivity towards CO2, was observed for the catalytic samples for the lower temperature range (400–550 °C), however for T > 550 °C a drastic decrease of CO and a concomitant increase of CO2 selectivity values could be observed. In regards to the CH4 production (not shown herein) all catalysts exhibited very low values (0–7%) for the whole temperature range. In contrast, SCH4 increases with temperature (especially for T > 550 °C) for the supporting materials with the increase more pronounced for pure Al2O3. The influence of reaction temperature on the H2/CO and the CO/CO2 molar ratios in the gaseous products’ mixture can be seen in Fig. 9. For all samples, the CO/CO2 molar ratio was close to zero for the high temperature range, whereas it drastically increased for T < 500 °C (except of the Rh/CeO2–Al2O3 catalyst); this increase seemed to be more pronounced for the supports. As for the H2/CO molar ratio, its value was almost stable (0.5–1.5) for the supports, whereas it increased with temperature reaching a plateau at T > 650 °C for the catalytic samples. Specifically, H2/CO molar ratio values ranged from about 2 to 3 at 400 °C to about 4.5 (Rh/MgO–Al2O3), 5.0 (Rh/CeO2–Al2O3), 7.5 (Rh/La2O3–Al2O3) and 10 (Rh/Al2O3) at 650 < T < 750 °C. Thus, it can be concluded that H2 yield and selectivity values over the supports alone are significantly lower than the catalytic samples. This can be attributed to the dominance of the methanation reactions at lower temperatures and the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction at higher temperatures, as both lead to the consumption of hydrogen [85]. The increasing trend for CO2 selectivity and decreasing trend for CO selectivity with increasing temperatures over the supports can be attributed to the dominance of water gas shift reaction, even at high temperatures [22]. The increased CH4 selectivity values in comparison to the catalytic samples further verify the dominance of methanation reactions over the supporting materials. Moreover, it can be seen that the H2/CO values significantly increase with temperature at the range of 500–650 °C for the Rh/Al2O3 and Rh/La2O3–Al2O3 catalyst, while for all other samples the upward tendency of H2/CO is greatly attenuated. The changes of CO/CO2 molar ratios show an opposite trend. The increasing of H2/CO and the decreasing of CO/CO2 molar ratios can be attributed to the accelerated WGSR, resulting in an increase in CO2 formation with increasing temperature [86], while they descend at temperature higher than 600 °C, due to the reverse WGSR [21]. Comparing with the supporting materials, the catalytic samples all showed higher H2/CO and lower CO/CO2 molar ratios in their gaseous product, suggesting that the addition of metals promoted the WGSR, resulting in an increased H2 production [87]. 3.2.3 Liquid products selectivity Although a variety of liquid products in trace amounts were identified, only the main effluents, i.e., acrolein, acetaldehyde, acetone, acetic acid, allyl alcohol and acetol were quantified and the results are presented in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 . As can be seen in Fig. 10, acetic acid was the main product for all supports, for temperature between 600 and 750 °C; acetol and acetone the secondary ones. For the catalytic samples (Fig. 11) allyl alcohol was the main liquid product for the high temperature range, whereas acetone and acetaldehyde were the secondary ones. It should be also mentioned that Rh/Al2O3 catalyst did not produce any liquid effluents for T > 550 °C; this temperature was lower than all catalytic samples. Rh/La2O3–Al2O3 stop producing liquid effluents at 600 °C, while the Rh/CeO2–Al2O3 and Rh/MgO–Al2O3 at 700 °C. In contrast, the corresponding supports (Fig. 10) all produced a variety of liquid effluents, even at high reaction temperatures with the exception of the La2O3–Al2O3 that produced only acetic acid at 750 °C. The proposed reaction pathway [88] over the metal and basic sites on the catalytic samples starts with glycerol dehydrogenation, followed by a dehydration step leading to pyruvaldehyde, which may be converted to acetol (hydroxyacetone) through hydrogenation over the metal sites and lactic acid, which may be produced by the Cannizzaro rearrangement due to the catalyst basicity. Aldehyde decarbonylation from the cleavage of C–C bonds would generate gaseous products. Concerning the acid–base properties, it is usually accepted that besides the strength of the acid sites, a narrow or more balanced distribution of basic strength is also desired; otherwise the selectivity and the stability may be strongly affected [17,89]. Unfortunately, fundamental studies on basic properties in catalyzed reactions are not as developed as the acid ones yet and much is still needed to be done in order to get a better understanding of their effect on performance. Nonetheless, it is generally agreed that the strength of basic sites required for base-catalyzed reactions, or a base-catalyzed reaction step as in glycerol reforming, varies with the easiness of proton abstraction from the reactant molecule under the reaction conditions employed [90]. 3.2.4 Catalytic stability The TOS results, which as explained above were undertaken at more severe conditions, are presented in Fig. 12 . As a first observation, the results for all catalysts were very close, making difficult to differentiate between them. Moreover, all catalysts exhibited a very stable performance for 12 h of reaction, as values for glycerol total conversion dropped from 95% to 90% and values for conversion into gaseous products dropped from 55% to 45%, respectively (Fig. 12a). The variation of H2 yield and selectivity with reaction time can be seen in Fig. 12b. Again it can be observed that H2 selectivity appeared very stable with time for all catalysts, ranging between 88% and 78%. The same trend applied for the H2 yield, with all catalyst obtaining a final value of 2.4–2.9 mol H2/mol glycerol. From Fig. 12c it can be seen that the CO2 and CO selectivity values were also quite constant with reaction time for all catalysts ranging from 76% to 65% and from 24% to 35%, respectively. As for the H2/CO and CO/CO2 molar ratios (Fig. 12d), their values ranged from 7.5 to 5.5 and from 0.4 to 0.5, respectively. Production of liquid effluents during TOS (not shown) remained constant, and for all catalysts a mixture of products were detected, consisting of acetol, acetone, ally alcohol, acetaldehyde and acetic acid, with acetol being the major one. It is well known that coke deposition and nanoparticles (NP) sintering are the most important deactivation factors in steam reforming catalysts. Coke is thought to be mainly deposited by surface reactions on acidic sites of support oxides [91] or by decomposition occurring at defects on metal nanoparticles [92] whereas NP sintering is a more complex phenomenon depending on several parameters which relate to the nature of the metal (e.g., its melting point temperature, reducibility, ionic radius/charge ratio for the inclusion in support lattice) or support (e.g., nature of the lattice, ease of ions substitution and formation of mixed oxides with metal ions and metal-support interactions). It has also been reported that the noble metals are more resistant to carbon deactivation compared to non noble metals. The carbon formed onto the spent catalysts tested herein was investigated using TEM and the results are presented in Fig. 4b. From the images it is clear that the carbonaceous deposits were amorphous as no filamentous or whisker types of coke could be detected. Moreover, the particle size distribution histograms make clear that only a minimal amount of sintering occurred during reaction. Both of these observations helped explain the excellent catalytic stability observed for all Rh catalysts. According to the literature, Rh is highly active for both C–C and C–H bond scission [93], as it induces the hydrogenation reaction [94]. Reports also suggest that Rh possesses the ability to minimize carbon formation in the GSR [30–33], which may be due to oxygen vacancies being easily accessible for oxidizing carbon [95–97]. Gonzalez-Gil et all [98] suggested that rhodium is not very active for WGS, but important for CO reduction in excessive presence of water in the feed favouring gasification of carbon over the catalyst’s surface. Moreover, the incorporation of CeO2, La2O3 or MgO in the support is known to reduce its acidity (which affects side reactions) and additionally promote the carbon removal via gasification reactions acting in synergy with Rh [99]. Overall, the remarkable stability of all Rh catalysts may be indeed associated with their high metal dispersion, which would facilitate in situ carbon decomposition/burn off during the reaction. As a matter of fact, the preparation method applied to obtain the samples has already been confirmed as a way to promote high metal dispersion and improved catalytic performance [43]. 3.2.5 Correlating catalytic performance with characterization properties The highest hydrogen production for the un-promoted catalyst can be initially attributed to its higher values of conversion to gaseous products (Fig. 6) and also to the extent of the reverse water gas shift reaction taking place for temperatures higher than 500 °C (Fig. 8). It is noted that the Rh/Al2O3 and Rh/10CeO2–Al2O3 samples have similar SSA values (lower than the Rh/10MgO–Al2O3 but higher than the Rh/10La2O3–Al2O3). Moreover, according to CO-chemisorption results the un-promoted catalyst has the third higher dispersion (26.5%) in comparison to the promoted ones, corresponding to a rather low Rh particle size (4.1 nm). On the other hand, TEM results revealed a di-dimensional range of their size (1.9 and 16.4 nm). Thus, it could be suggested that it is not the active phase dispersion or the Rh particle size the crucial parameter for catalytic performance as long as conversion to gaseous products and hydrogen yield (or selectivity) are concerned. As a result, a different reaction pathway seems to be valid for the un-promoted catalyst and the promoted ones (see also the liquid product distribution figures) that depends strongly on the population and kind of acid and basic sites over their surface. Concerning population, it can be depicted from Table 2 that the Rh/Al2O3 catalyst had the lowest total basicity (81.5 μmolCO2 g−1) and the highest total acidity (0.87 mmolNH3·g−1) values. It seems that the addition of metal oxides (CeO2, MgO, La2O3) to the γ-Al2O3 support led to an increase in basicity (greater concentration of both weak and medium basic sites) and a decrease in acidity (mainly lower concentration of the weak acid sites). Furthermore, the absence of a desorption peak in the high temperature region of Rh/Al2O3 sample confirmed the absence of Brønsted acidity (Fig. 5) whereas the tail could be attributed to the presence of Lewis acid sites with different strength, that seem to be the ones that contribute to the improved hydrogen production of the un-promoted catalyst [100]. According to literature reports, the organic liquid by-products in the glycerol steam reforming reaction include 1,3-propanediol, phenol, ethylene glycol, dihydroxyacetone, hydroxyacetone and glycolaldehyde (see also Figs. 9–11). The production of 1,3-propanediol indicates the removal of hydroxyl groups via the hydrogenolysis reactions or the dehydration reactions followed by hydrogenation. It is likely that the Brønsted acidic sites on the surface of the promoted catalysts used herein facilitated the dehydration reactions. In contrast, as the surface of Rh/Al2O3 did not contain Brønsted acidic sites, it did not promote the formation of 1,3-propanediol, but promoted the production of dihydroxyacetone via the dehydrogenation reactions. These findings are in agreement with Li et al. [101] reporting that the distribution of the Lewis and Brønsted acidic sites over the Ni–Al2O3 and Ni–SiO2 catalysts significantly impacted not only the formation of the organic by-products, but also the tendency to coking for the steam reforming of various alcohols including glycerol. Moreover, Babaei et al. [102] using DFT calculations suggested that the mechanism of dehydration of glycerol to acrolein on the (1 0 0) surface of anatase TiO2 goes through three paths that starts with adsorption through central hydroxyl groups. Chai et al. [103] studied the synthesis of acrolein over various solid catalysts with a wide range of acidity function strength. Their results illustrated that the most effective solid acid catalysts for the effective and selective conversion of glycerol to acrolein are the Brønsted acids in the range of −8.2 < H0 < −3.0 acidity strength, as it is the case of the promoted catalysts tested herein. The authors also argued over the secondary hydrogenation of acrolein to allyl alcohol and the hydro-genation of 1-hydroxyacetone carbonyl group to 1,2-propandiol by some types of solid base catalyst such as CeO2, La2O3, and MgO. Various MxOy–Al2O3 oxides (M = Zr, Mg, Ni, Ce, La), prepared by a sol–gel method, were used as supports for rhodium catalysts in methane and ethanol dry reforming [104]. For ethanol dry reforming reaction at 800 °C, the highest yields in hydrogen are obtained in the following ranking: Rh/Al2O3 ≈ Rh/MgO–Al2O3 ≈ Rh/CeO2–Al2O3 > Rh/ZrO2–Al2O3 ≈ Rh/La2O3–Al2O3 even if on alumina support, rhodium species could also exist in an oxidized form of Rh2O3 with a rhombohedral lattice system. Kousi et all [105] reported that at low reaction temperature (400 °C), the support has a determining role on the catalytic performance and the selectivity to various oxygenates depending on the acid-base properties of the catalyst. The authors argued that as alumina possesses mainly Lewis acidity whereas B2O3–Al2O3 materials have higher acidity (mainly of Brønsted type) related to the boron content, RuAl is more active as regards C–C bond dissociation and WGS reaction, while condensation and polymerization are enhanced over the more acidic RuBAl, in agreement also with other literature reports [106]. On the other hand, RuMgAl catalyst exhibits a very different selectivity to oxygenate products, forming more acetaldehyde and much less acrolein than the other two samples. Another possible reason is the partial coverage of the Ru particles by the support, a phenomenon reported for a Ru/MgAl2O4 catalyst [83]. Similar with our catalytic activity classification was also obtained for Ru catalysts (Ru/Al2O3> Ru/YSZ » Ru/MgAl2O4) in a work reporting on monometallic (1 wt% of Ru or 5 wt% of Ni) and bimetallic catalysts (1 wt% Ru-5 wt.% Ni) deposited on alumina (Al2O3), magnesium aluminate spinel (MgAl2O4), and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) tested for the methane dry reforming reaction [107]."
10,Conclusions,"In this work, Rh-based catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 modified with CeO2, MgO or La2O3, were synthesized by coupling the surfactant-assisted co-precipitation method and the wet impregnation technique. This is the first time that this particular technique is used for the preparation of catalysts that were tested for the GSR. N2 adsorption-desorption measurements revealed that both supports and catalysts used herein were mesoporous with a broad pore size distribution. Moreover, the synthesis method chosen allowed the obtainment of supports with remarkably high specific surface area values (ranging between 167 and 251 m2 g−1), even after calcination at 600 °C. However, the introduction of Rh and a further calcination step at 800 °C let to a substantial reduction to the SSA (ranging between 119 and 184 m2 g−1). The TPR profiles of all catalysts showed a peak at ≈140–155 °C, assigned to the reduction of Rh2O3 to metallic Rh. For the modified catalysts, peaks at higher temperatures indicated strong interactions between Rh and the respective oxides, i.e., CeO2 (400 °C) MgO (400 °C) and La2O3 (370 and 460 °C), respectively. CO-chemisorption measurements showed high Rh dispersion (26.5, 29.9, 34.3 and 19.4% for the Rh/Al2O3, Rh/CeO2–Al2O3, Rh/MgO and Rh/La2O3–Al2O3, respectively), in agreement with the XRD results, and small Rh particle size (ranging from 3.2 to 5.7 nm). TEM measurements confirmed the small Rh particle size. CO2-TPD showed that all catalysts were mainly characterized by the presence of weak and medium basic sites and NH3-TPd results revealed that the addition of the CeO2, MgO, La2O3 promoters led to a slight decrease in the concentration of acid sites on to the Al2O3 support. The catalytic activity results showed that the Rh/Al2O3 sample was more selective towards gaseous products and the Rh/MgO–Al2O3 the least selective catalyst. Also, the Rh/Al2O3 catalyst showed the highest H2 selectivity and yield values, especially for temperatures over 550 °C. Moreover, all catalysts showed lower selectivity towards CO and higher selectivity towards CO2 above 550 °C and very low selectivity towards CH4 for the whole temperature range under investigation. The Rh/Al2O3 catalyst did not produce any liquid effluents over 550 °C a temperature that was lower than all other catalytic samples. It was followed by Rh/La2O3–Al2O3, which stopped producing liquid effluents at 600 °C, and then the Rh/CeO2–Al2O3 and Rh/MgO–Al2O3 (700 °C). The time-on-stream results showed that all catalysts were remarkably stable, with glycerol total conversion dropping from 95% to 90%, conversion into gaseous products from 55% to 45% and H2 selectivity from 88% to 78%. The final H2 yield for all catalysts was 2.4–2.9 mol H2/mol glycerol. TEM experiments showed that the carbon formed onto the spent catalysts was amorphous and that sintering was mostly avoided during time-on-stream, helping explain the excellent catalytic stability observed."
