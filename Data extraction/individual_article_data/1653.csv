0,Introduction,"The combustion of fossil fuel has been predominated approximately 80% of the global energy consumption since the industrialized era (Chen et al., 2008). Besides, in the last decade the huge increase in world energy consumption has taken place, which will continue to occur in the next fifty years (Lucas et al., 2015), due to modernization and population increase (Lucas et al., 2015). Hydrogen (H2) has been widely considered as an available alternative energy carrier due to its effectiveness and cleanness. However, over 96% of world H2 production relies on fossil fuels, resulting in environmental pollution and energy crisis (Zhang et al., 2015a). Thus, it is urgent to develop other techniques for H2 production in a sustainable, cost effective and eco-friendly way. Among various H2 production methods, biological processes like photosynthesis microbial electrolysis cells and fermentation can provide H2 from abundant and cheap sources like organic wastes from biorefinery industries (Zhang et al., 2015a). Moreover, dark fermentation for H2 production requires less energy compared to other H2 processes. Bio-H2 techniques mainly include dark fermentation process and photosynthetic H2 production. Compared to photosynthetic H2 production, dark fermentation process has evolved to the cutting-edge technology due to its economic efficiency, operation simplicity, and its independence on the availability of solar irradiation. Bio-H2 production via dark fermentation also reveals the advantages of sustainable energy and carbon balance. Nonetheless, the major drawbacks of this technique are lower microbial conversion efficiency of substrate into H2 and large amounts of CO2 emissions. Dark fermentation for H2 has been established for several decades, but it still needs to be optimized in the case of process stability, inhibition problems and higher H2 yields (Bundhoo and Mohee, 2016). Theoretically, the complete bioconversion of glucose into H2 could give 1493mlH2/g glucose (12-molH2/mol glucose). However, during the practical conversion there are no known existing anaerobes and metabolic pathways that may be capable of doing that and practical H2 yields appear to be limited to 4-mol (498ml) H2/mol glucose (Hallenbeck, 2009). A well-known issue concerning H2 fermentation from carbon-rich organic materials such as food waste, cane molasses, starch wastewater, fruit and vegetable wastes, is inhibition due to the vulnerability of fermentation micro-ecology. Many efforts have aimed to enhance the enrichment and activity of anaerobic microbes, and the additions of carrier and some trace elements are regarded as necessary measures (Mumme et al., 2014; Luo et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2013). In addition, to improve H2 yield by dark fermentation, previous reports have focused on metabolic bioengineering (e.g., over-expression of hydrogenase) and key parameter optimization such as microbial selection and pH regulation (Zhang et al., 2011). Recently, considerable attention has been paid to the potential application of carbon-rich material as carbon sequestration, soil amendment and pollutant remediation (Ahmad et al., 2014). The material is produced by thermal decomposition and recognized as biochar (BC) that is expected to improve crop productivity and reduce greenhouse gas emission. However, the broad application of BC is impeded due to relatively high costs (Roberts et al., 2010). It is necessary to overcome this major drawback in order to obtain economic benefits via expanding the BC value chain. For example, BC was served as an additive that increased biogas production in anaerobic digestion due to its ability to promote bio-film formation and mitigate acid and ammonia inhibition (Gong et al., 2011; Mumme et al., 2014). 10g/L of BC addition to mesophilic anaerobic bioreactor inoculated with anaerobic granules and fed with 4g/L glucose significantly increased maximum methane (CH4) production rate by 86.6% and decreased methanogenic lag phase time by 30.3% than the control test without BC (Luo et al., 2015). Another similar report about the improvement of H2 production from organic fraction of municipal solid waste by BC addition showed that BC addition shortened lag phase time from 12.5±0.6h at control without BC to 8.1±0.5h with 12.5g/L BC and harvested maximum H2 yield of 96.63±2.8mlH2/g carbohydrates (Sharma and Melkania, 2017). There was a slight difference in optimal concentrations of BC, which was likely due to the main differences in substrate, inoculum and their metabolic pathways. Sunyoto et al. (2016) also found that BC addition could reduce the lag phase time of bio-CH4 by 21.4–35.7%, and it further increased the subsequent H2 production potential by 14.2–31.0%. These reports indicated that porous BC would provide a relatively big surface area for the adhesion and growth of anaerobes and reduce the inhibition behavior by absorbing inhibitors (Wang and Han, 2012). However, there have been limited investigations on the application of BC for the fermentative production of organic acids or H2. Besides, some elements such as sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) are essential micronutrients for bacterial metabolism, affecting hydrogen production. Among them Fe is a vital micronutrient, which acts as the co-factor for Fe-S protein and hydrogenase (Junelles et al., 1998). Wide varieties of prokaryotes contain hydrogenase that functions in the treatment of excess electrons by H2 formations. The Fe-S protein in ferredoxin serves as an electron carrier during pyruvate oxidation into CO2 and acetyl CoA (Schonheit et al., 1979). The addition of zero-valent iron (Fe0) was shown to obtain 38.2% more H2, and the coupled system of activated carbon and Fe0 could further improve H2 yield (50.2%) (Zhang et al., 2015a). The maximum H2 yields of 140.6ml and 145ml/g glucose were observed at 50mg/L of Fe2+ by Karadag and Puhakka (2010) and Wu et al. (2017), respectively, while the maximum H2 yield of 131.9ml/g glucose was obtained at 352mg/L of Fe2+ in another previous study (Lee et al., 2001). Although the optimal Fe2+ concentrations for different bio-H2 production processes were not the same, these studies showed that shortage of iron could limit the activities of hydrogen-producing bacteria (HPB). Moreover, a suitable concentration of iron in batch process can help to raise H2 yield at various temperatures (Zhang and Shen, 2006). Li et al. (2009) compared the H2 yield from glucose by supplementing Fe0 and Fe2+, respectively. They found that Fe0 played a better role in promoting bio-H2 production than Fe2+, and the inhibition of high concentration of Fe0 to HPB was lower than that of Fe2+ (Li et al., 2009). The maximum H2 conversion efficiency of 353.5mlH2/g COD was harvested under the optimized conditions of 7000mgCOD/L, 150mgFe0/L and pH of 5.5 (Yogeswari et al., 2016). Fe0 is essential for enriching the dominant HPB (Yogeswari et al., 2016). However, the corrosion of Fe0 strongly depends on solution pH, and ferrous oxides formed on Fe0 surface may lower the activity of iron (Zhang et al., 2015a). Furthermore, it is difficult to treat the fermentation residue containing Fe0. Multiple lines of evidences indicate that the application of BC or Fe in anaerobic fermentation might be beneficial. Nonetheless, related studies are largely unavailable, and some essential mechanisms are unclarified, especially the synergic effects of Fe2+ and BC. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no report on the synergic behaviors of BC and Fe2+ in H2 fermentation until date. Hence, this study was conducted to assess the performances of BC/Fe2+ system in bio-H2 process and to investigate the mechanism of improving H2 production in such eco-system. To achieve this aim, the effects of Fe2+ and BC concentrations on H2 fermentation from glucose medium were firstly investigated. Then the improvement of H2 production by BC/Fe2+ system was evaluated, which was compared with adding BC and Fe2+, respectively. Finally, the possible mechanisms of increase in H2 yield and process stability were clarified."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Anaerobic sludge and materials,"2.1 Anaerobic sludge and materials Corn-bran residue (CBR) was obtained from a cornstarch plant in Shandong, China. The CBR was dried and crushed in order to keep its sizes ranging from 60 to 120 mesh (Zhang and Zheng, 2015). After that, it was used to produce BC at 600°C with heating rate of 5°C/min. Both CBR and BC were directly subjected to characterization without further treatment, and their elemental compositions and surface characteristics had been previously described (Zhang and Zheng, 2015). The BC was dried in an oven at 105°C before use. The specific surface area (SSA), pH, point of zero charge (pHPZC), ash contents, and elemental compositions were shown in Table 1 (Zhang and Zheng, 2015). Moreover, since the effect of sulfate (SO4 2−) on H2 production in a previous report was not obvious (Yang and Shen, 2006), ferrous sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4·7H2O) was used to provide Fe2+ for H2 fermentation, which were obtained from Tianjin Chemical Reagent Plant (China). The deionized water used this work was taken from the second-level reverse osmosis device in the Key Laboratory of Cleaner Production and Industrial Wastes Recycling and Resourcization in Universities of Shandong. Sewage sludge (SS) was obtained from a biochemical plant (Rizhao, China), which generated from the combined techniques of up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket and extended aeration activated sludge processes for treating citric acid wastewater. The SS with approximate 80% of water was incubated under mesophilic (37°C) and anaerobic conditions without any nutrient addition. The incubation process lasted 40d until the biogas production phase accomplished. After that, the incubated SS was heated at 85°C for 30min so as to restrain methanogenic activities, eliminate interspecies hydrogen transfer and enrich HPB. Such heat treatment method to enrich HBP has been proved to be simple and effective in theory and practice (Li and Fang, 2007). Subsequently, the SS cooled to 37°C was cultivated in a medium containing glucose (1000mg/L) at 37°C for 36h. This sludge was concentrated by setting for 8h, and storage at 4°C prior to further use. The properties of anaerobic sludge used as inoculum are as follows: pH: 7.1±0.1, mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS, mg/L): 58±4.0, soluble total organic carbon (STOC, mg/L): 2200±100, mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS, mg/L): 28±1.5, and ammonia nitrogen (NH4 +-N, mg/L): 46±2.0."
3,Batch fermentation,"2.2 Batch fermentation The batch H2 fermentation test was conducted in an 800ml bioreactor with a working volume of 500ml. In order to avoid the inhibition of anaerobes caused by the high concentration of Fe2+ or BC, 200ml deionized water was added into each bioreactor, followed by adding 150g anaerobic sludge. Subsequently, 5000mg of glucose, 200mg of peptone, and various dosages of Fe2+ or BC were supplemented into these bioreactors, blending and diluting to 500ml with deionized water. Therefore, the parameters of inoculation rate and organic load in each bioreactor were 30% (V/V) and 10g glucose/L, respectively. Moreover, the initial concentrations of Fe2+ ranged from 0 to 200mg/L, while the dosages of BC ranged from 0 to 1000mg/L. The large headspace volume (about 250ml) of bioreactor could alleviate the adverse influences caused by high H2 partial pressure. Then, the headspace of each bioreactor was flushed with N2 for 30–60s, which could provide an anaerobic environment. Subsequently, the bioreactors were quickly sealed using butyl rubber and placed in a water bath with 100rpm at 37°C for 24h. Each test was conducted in triplicate."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The biogas composition and collection were the same as described in a previous study (Zhang et al., 2013). All gas production data reported were expressed at normal temperature and pressure conditions (273.15K, 101.325KPa). Soluble metabolic products such as C2-C4 were analyzed on a gas chromatograph system (GC8000, FISONS, Italy) with a flame ionization detector. The carrier gas was nitrogen and the temperatures of injection port and detector were 180–210°C, respectively. In addition, other key parameters, like total carbon (TC), total organic carbon (TOC), inorganic carbon (IC), solvent pH and NH4 +-N were determined using the methods reported previously (Zhang et al., 2014)."
5,Kinetic modeling,"2.4 Kinetic modeling The cumulative hydrogen production (CHP) curve was employed to estimate the maximum potential hydrogen yield (MPHY). The hydrogen fermentation process includes four phases: Lag, exponential, stationary and decline periods. The MPHY and lag period are important kinetic parameters to reflect the performance of biohydrogen process. The kinetic parameters were estimated based on the modified Gompertz model as described in Eq. (1): (1) P ( t ) = P m exp - exp R m · e P m ( λ - t ) + 1 where P(t) is the CHP (ml) at t time (h), Rm represents the maximal H2 production rate (ml/h), Pm describes the MPHY (ml), λ and t are the lag phase time (h) and incubation time (h) respectively. The kinetic parameters such as Pm , Rm , and λ were determined by the software of Origin 8.5, and their correlation coefficients (R 2) were further evaluated."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effect of Fe2+ on hydrogen production,"3.1 Effect of Fe2+ on hydrogen production H2 production in batch tests without pH control were conducted. The demand of growth and metabolism for various microorganisms on the concentration of metal ion is diverse. For HPB, Fe ion is important in particular for hydrogenase protein redox, which directly relates with cell growth and biogas release (Zhang et al., 2015c). In order to investigate the effects of Fe2+, the anaerobic sludge was performed with different concentrations of Fe2+ (0, 50, 100, 200, and 300mg/L). The H2 yields and solvent products from these bioreactors during the fermentation of glucose are shown in Table 2 . The biogas generated from the batch tests only consists of H2 and carbon dioxide (CO2) during the course of H2 production. The results indicate that H2 yield increased up to 200mg/L of Fe2+ and decreased with 300mg/L of Fe2+. As shown in Fig. 1 , with a raise of Fe2+ concentration from 0 (Control) to 200mg/L, CHP raises from 790 to 1085ml and the corresponding H2 yield increases from 158 to 217.4ml/g glucose. The maximum H2 yield of 217.4ml/g glucose is obtained at Fe2+ concentration of 200mg/L. However, once the Fe2+ concentration is above 200mg/L, both CHP and H2 yield start to reduce slightly. It is notable that H2 production also increases from 3.0 to 174ml/g glucose in exponential growth phases of batch fermentations. It was obvious that a high H2-producing peak (174ml/g glucose) at the increased concentration of Fe2+ (more than 200mg/L) did not occur. The reason for the absence of high peak at initial pH range of 5.8–7.0, could be due to the facts that the excess soluble Fe2+ is toxic to the anaerobes. It lowers [Fe-Fe] hydrogenase, and has slightly inhibitive effect on H2 production (Kim and Kim, 2011), which causes the final reduces of CHP and H2 yield in these systems. The inhibition lasts to the end of bioprocess and gets stronger with pH decrease because of the formation of VFAs (Yang and Shen, 2006). In addition, the lower CHP or H2 yield can be due to the presence of large amount of SO4 2− in the Fe2+ (300mg/L) reactor. Some reports showed that the appropriate increase of Fe+ concentration could improve the capability of HPB, but the optimal Fe+ concentration for each biohydrogen process was different (Yang and Shen, 2006; Zhang and Shen, 2006). Some researchers found that the optimal concentrations of Fe+ for H2 production decreased obviously with raising system temperature, and the maximum H2 yield of 25, 35, and 40°C achieved at the FeSO4 concentration of 800, 200, and 25mg/L, respectively (Zhang and Shen, 2006), which was similar to the present study. However, others concluded that the optimal concentrations of FeSO4 was 3200mg/L under the conditions of 35°C and initial pH 8.0. This could be explained by the fact that there were some differences in key parameters such as HPB, substrate, fermentation temperature, initial pH, hydraulic retention time and Fe2+ concentration. On the other hand, pH plays an important role in the performance of anaerobic microbes and the component of effluent (Abreu et al., 2009). Moreover, a majority of the H2 production occurred during a period of relatively stable pH that was relatively close to the final pH (Zhu et al., 2009). H2 production obviously increases when pH drops from approximately 7.0–5.0 (Table 2). However, the rate of H2 production decreased quickly when system pH value is below 5.0, and anaerobe concentration in fermentation system declines (Wu et al., 2017). Furthermore, hydrogenase is one of the important rate-limiting enzymes in biohydrogen production metabolism (Zhang et al., 2015c). The enzyme activity of bio-H2 process depends evidently on the changes of hydrogenases structure and function (Zhang et al., 2015c). The pH also affects the degree of dissociation and the electric charge situation of zymoprotein (Zhang et al., 2015c). The inappropriate pH values below 4.5 or above 7.5 can inhibit hydrogenase activity, leading to shift in metabolic pathways from H2 production phase to a solvent phase (Davila-Vazquez et al., 2008). Although suitable pH values ranging from 5.0 to 7.0 have positive effects on the hydrogenase activity (Zhang et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2015c), the optimal pH value varies due to the key differences including bacterial strain, substrate type, fermentation temperature and duration. The membrane-related formate hydrogen lyase catalyzes the disproportionation of formate to H2 and CO2. When the fermentation pH values are relatively low (Zhang et al., 2015c), the activity reaches the maximum at pH 4.5, but the greatest value of specific H2 yield is obtained at pH 5.0 (Zhang et al., 2015c)."
8,Effect of BC on hydrogen production,"3.2 Effect of BC on hydrogen production Since H2 fermentation is highly dependent on pH, in situ removal of VFAs is required when fermentation is carried out without pH-control. The effects of different BC dosage on H2 production from batch cultures are described in Fig. 2 . The BC concentration influences medium pH value, HPB growth, gene expression, metabolite accumulation and pathways, as well as the lag phase in this bioprocess (Sharma and Melkania, 2017). The H2 production is considerably influenced by the concentration of BC in the experimental range. This is likely due to that suitable concentration of BC can provide a relatively stable and appropriate pH value between 5.0 and 7.0, and enrich HPB, which can maintain high concentration of HPB and improve enzyme activity. Nevertheless, the H2 yield from BC can be neglected because BC as the carbon source is not assimilated by HPB (Li et al., 2014). As compared to no addition of BC, the BC can decrease the duration of the start-up phase, and consequently shorten H2 evolution time. It is clear that all bioreactors with BC addition produce higher CHP than those without BC. However, when the BC concentration is higher than 800mg/L, the CHP starts to decrease slightly (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2, the CHP increases with the raising BC concentration, and the maximum CHP is obtained at BC concentration of 600mg/L, with the corresponding H2 yield and its increment of 204.0ml/g glucose and 29.11%, respectively. This might be due to the support of anaerobe growth on the surface of BC particles. These particles are suitable for attachment of anaerobes due to their well-defined porous structure. Moreover, the BC appears to enhance its resistance to excessively acidic conditions. Some bacteria can reside deep within the pore channel of BC, being of great benefit to the establishment of hydrogenogenic zones in bioprocess system (Cooney et al., 2015). Besides, many HPBs are already enriched around BC even in the early H2 evolution period (Cooney et al., 2015). The possible explanations for the preference of these microorganisms for BC surface are as follows: (1) porous BC improves direct electron or H2 transfer efficiency, (2) porous BC promotes the biofilm growth, and (3) significantly, alkali BC may be act as a buffering agent by adjusting the solution pH. Another declaration may be that BC functions as only a carrier for microbial attachment and cell growth that increase biomass concentration. However, it is interesting to observe that the increase in H2 yield by BC addition do not result in more glucose consumption. When BC concentration further increases to 800mg/L, the H2 yield decreases to 182.2ml/g glucose (Table 3 ). This phenomenon indicates that excessive amounts of BC can lead to inhibit cell growth that is probably due to weak alkaline solutions or BC collision and aggregation. Along with the increase in the BC concentration, the concentrations of propionic and butyric acids as well as ethanol decreased slightly while the acetic acid concentration and final pH increased (Table 3). At lower concentration of BC, the dominant metabolic pathway was butyrate-type fermentation, which shifted to propionate pathway because of organic overloading (Sharma and Melkania, 2017). Higher concentration of BC raises acidogenesis rate, which causes the higher ratio of NADH/NAD+. In order to keep a balanced ratio of NADH/NAD+, propionate pathway spontaneously activates and more NAD+ is generated (Wang and Zhao, 2009). The results also agree with a previous report about butyrate-type fermentative pathway at BC concentration below 8.3g/L and propionate-type fermentation pathway at higher concentration of BC (Sunyoto et al., 2016). On the other hand, at the same organic load, the increase in BC concentration can improve the buffering capacity of the H2 fermentation system, and thus raises the final pH. Bio-H2 production relies highly on the pH value of fermentation system. A suitable pH of 6.2–6.8 can help to sustain the surface charge on the cell membrane. This facilitates nutrient uptake and maintains HPB growth. Furthermore, the hydrogenase activity that controls the bio-H2 process is pH dependent (Wong et al., 2014). H2 yield rises with the increase in final pH (Table 3). BC contains some alkaline groups that can neutralize certain acids (Zhang and Zheng, 2015), and enhances the alkalinity of fermentation system, thus it may have better buffer capacity to maintain appropriate pH range for HPB growth and activity. The BC used this work is produced at 600°C, which is alkaline (pH 8.92), as shown Table 1. There are some alkaline groups such as COOH and OH on the surface of BC, which is responsible for the negative charge (Zhang and Zheng, 2015). Since the adsorption of polar alcohols and acids onto BC is considered as physical adsorption and depends mainly on electronic polarizability (Selim et al., 1981), the reduced physical adsorption of acetic acid at high pH is likely due to the reduced dipole-dipole interactions. BC can also enhance microbial colonization in the bioreactor because it has large surface area (58.232m2/g) (Table 1) (Sharma and Melkania, 2017). The porous structure of BC accommodates a wide range of anaerobic microbes and thus facilitates bio-film formation (Cooney et al., 2015). From the results, the higher CHP or H2 yield was likely due to the enrichments of HPB, which might push forward the HPB for acetate-type fermentation. Consequently, acetate concentration of the BC group was higher than that of the control group without BC (Table 3). Propionate had the same trend with acetate, which was consistent with a previous report (Sunyoto et al., 2016). Thus, BC can be used as a carrier for cell immobilization (or growth) and a buffer for solution pH in H2 fermentation process, which favors functional anaerobes through different approaches to obtain better process stability and higher conversion efficiency."
9,Synergic effect of Fe2+ and BC on hydrogen production,"3.3 Synergic effect of Fe2+ and BC on hydrogen production Glucose consumption, liquid products and hydrogen production are highly connected with cell growth. The CHP increases with the raising concentration ratio of BC to Fe2+ (BC/Fe2+) (Fig. 3 ). When BC/Fe2+ is 3:1(600mg/L of BC and 200mg/L of Fe2+), the BC/Fe2+ fermentation system obtains the highest H2 yield of 234.4ml/g glucose (Table 4 ). The percentage increase in H2 yield compared with the control group is approximately 50％. The reasons are probably that the BC/Fe2+ fermentation system has positive and synergic effect on HPB growth and hydrogenase activity, especially resulting in the decrease in H2 fermentation time. Moreover, the increase in H2 yield with the simultaneous stabilization during the glucose consumption may associate with metabolic pathway shift (Akutsu et al., 2009a). In fact, a bio-H2 process corresponds to a series of oxidation and reduction reactions that must be in good balance. Generally, the varieties of soluble metabolic products and their distributions are key indicators for determining hydrogen production in the fermentation process. Thus, the concentrations of solvent products were analyzed. As revealed in Tables 2–4, the dominating types of VFAs in each fermentation system are acetate and butyrate. The concentrations of acetate are 1573 and 1087mg/L for the BC-Fe2+ (3:1) and control groups respectively. There is an interesting phenomenon that higher H2 yield is often accompanied with higher acetate concentration (Tables 2–4). Besides, different facilitation techniques only make a slight difference in the contents of other metabolites. In general, H2 evolution is related with the metabolic pathways of acetic acid and butyric acid. Thus, the two acids are vital metabolic products, as described in (2) and (3) (Akutsu et al., 2009a). (2) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O=2CH 3 COOH+2CO 2 + 4 H 2 Δ G 0 = - 206 KJ (3) C 6 H 12 O 6 = C 3 H 7 COOH+2CO 2 + 2 H 2 Δ G 0 = - 254 KJ The maximum of 2.0mol (248.88ml/g glucose) of H2 based on Eqs. (2) and (3), can be acquired from the butyrate-type fermentation, whereas up to 4.0mol (497.78ml/g glucose) of H2 can be obtained from the acetate-type fermentation. The two reactions are thermodynamically favorable and spontaneous, but they are also restricted by interspecies interactions in microbial communities and biological regulations within anaerobes. Butyrate-type fermentation based on the Gibb's free energy change ( Δ G 0 ), is more energetically favorable than acetate-type one. In practice, H2 yield is lower due to the formation of butyric acid and the incomplete degradation of glucose. Therefore, the concentration ratio of acetate to butyrate (HAc/HBu) has significant influence on the conversion efficiency of glucose into H2. The BC/Fe2+ reactor has the highest concentration ratios of acetate to butyrate ranging from 0.75 to 0.84. Comparatively, the HAc/HBu ratios for the BC (600mg/L) and Fe2+ (200mg/L) reactors are 0.58–0.66 respectively, while the control group has the lowest ratio of 0.50. This findings indicates that HAc/HBu ratio positively correlates with H2 yield (Tables 2–4), This is in agreement with the findings in previous studies that the additives (e.g., activated carbon, Fe0 or Fe2+) used to facilitate H2 production can influence the metabolic pathways of anaerobes (Akutsu et al., 2009b; Yang and Shen, 2006; Zhang et al., 2015b). When co-metabolites like H2 or VFA accumulate in high concentration in the fermentation system, they usually strongly suppress both the growth of fermentative bacteria and the metabolic production. Thus, based on stoichiometric Eqs. (2) and (3), BC can adsorb a small amount of VFAs, or remove undesired by products, facilitating the positive reaction to H2 evolution. A similar study reported that BC addition improved H2 yield by 31.0%, shortened the lag phase by 36.0%, and enhanced VFA generation during two-phase anaerobic digestion from food waste (Sunyoto et al., 2016). Furthermore, the report also revealed that the cultures with suitable concentration of BC followed acetic or butyric acid pathway, while those with high concentration of BC were likely to follow the propionic pathway (Sunyoto et al., 2016). On the other hand, it is also evident that there is no significant difference between the VFA yields of the system with the BC addition and the control group. The culture with BC (or Fe2+) and without BC (or Fe2+) addition produces acetic and butyric acids as dominant VFAs, indicating that BC or Fe2+ addition do not change the fermentation type of mixed bacteria. It is evident that BC improves biofilm formation and provides microbial growth with temporary nutrients (Mumme et al., 2014). BC has high surface area (58.232m2/g), favoring microbial colonization during H2 evolution process. Besides, BC contains dissolved carbon that can be easily decomposed by anaerobes. Thus, BC can be used as temporary culture to facilitate microbial growth and metabolism in the end of H2 production. The increase of H2 production is contributed by the carbon source and other nutrients from BC. It is also believed that the capability of BC in buffering pH of the substrates improves H2 yield. Iron is another key factor on H2 evolution, which is an essential element to form ferredoxin and hydrogenase (Bao et al., 2013). The hydrogenase contains iron clusters and a unique type of Fe-S center termed hydrogen cluster that acts as the site of H2 evolution. Moreover, the iron clusters support the electron transfer between the external electron carrier and the hydrogen cluster (Wu et al., 2017). However, excessive Fe2+ in return causes lower initial pH and higher concentration of SO4 2+. H2 and VFA yields increase obviously when pH decreases from initial about 7.0 to final 5.0 or so (Figs. 1 and 3; Tables 2 and 4). However, both rate of H2 evolution and VFA production decrease slightly when pH is below 5.0. As shown in Figs. 1 and 3, most of the VFA accumulation occurs during the exponential growth phase of HPB in these batch tests, which is similar with the control. These exponential growth phases end at about 18h and more glucose is consumed, and consequently more H2 is produced (Figs. 1–3), while the whole fermentation process ends 24h. CHP or H2 yield generally increase with increment of initial pH of fermentation system (Tables 2 and 3). It had been illustrated that undissociated butyric acid could constrain cell growth at the concentration of 200–400mg/L (Monot et al., 1983). Moreover, most of the butyric acid exists in the undissociated form at pH 4.9, which is more toxic than undissociated acetic acid in constraining of H2 evolution (Steven and Logan, 2005). Thus, the H2 yield at final pH bellow 4.9 is the lowest (184mlH2/g glucose) for these bioreactors with various concentrations of Fe2+ (Table 2). Cell growth was also constrained and the lag phase delays. However, suitable BC addition may prevent system pH value decreasing, and obviously relieves the negative effects from propionic and butyric acids (Fig. 3 and Table 4). Furthermore, the formation of biofilm on the surface of BC serves to sustain cell viability and to increase microbial density. The surface porosity of BC facilitates the anaerobic microorganisms to attach on the carrier surface, forming a stable biofilm. The acclimatization process improves the cell density to adhere on the BC surface, providing stable H2 production. This is likely due to the fact that the biofilms formed on BC has a high tendency in binding organic matter, thereby providing an environment rich in nutrients and improving the microbial adhesion, which is in agreement with previous studies (Jamali et al., 2016; Mohan et al., 2009). Moreover, the biofilm-based system has been widely used in bio-H2 process as immobilization cell techniques because they improve microbial population dynamics (Li and Fang, 2007)."
10,Hydrogen production compared with other studies,"3.4 Hydrogen production compared with other studies As described in Table 5 , there are some similar reports on bio-H2 production using different type of support carriers. Highly related results were obtained from Wu et al. (2017) and Lin et al. (2016). As shown in Table 5, the highest H2 yield harvested by them are 145.0 and 192.4ml/g glucose, respectively, which are lower than those (204.0–234.4ml/g glucose) of the present work. The differences in H2 production between the previous and present studies are due to the vital differences in initial pH values, anaerobic microbes and their carriers. This further clarified that BC support carrier plays a key role in H2 evolution. This work has contributed additional information in developing the attached-biofilm on BC, revealing that BC and Fe2+ have synergic effects on enhancing hydrogenase activity and cell growth. In addition, as shown in Figs. 1–3 and Tables 2–5, both glucose conversion efficiency and H2 yield obtained in this work are comparable with, even higher than those reported previously, suggesting the economic viability of this process."
11,Conclusions,"BC and Fe2+ can improve CHP and H2 yield, and shorten fermentation lag phase significantly. BC make HPB to attach it tightly and promotes cell growth quickly, whereas Fe2+ facilitates hydrogenase activity. Both of them synergistically enhance H2 elevation, leading to higher H2 production rate and conversion efficiency of glucose into H2. As compared with the control (without BC and Fe2+ additions), the synergic mechanisms of BC and Fe2+ shorten the lag phase by 50.1%, and increase H2 yield by 32.59%. However, H2 yields decrease slightly when further increasing BC and Fe2+ concentrations to 800 and 300mg/L, respectively."
