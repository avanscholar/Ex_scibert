0,Introduction,"The energy demand has increased dramatically in recent decades due to the continuous development of society and the increase of population which led to depletion of fossil reservoirs (Wang et al., 2017; Yuan et al., 2020). The large amounts of carbon dioxide, sulfide, and nitrogen oxides produced during burning of fossil fuels have caused great damage to the ecological environment and seriously threaten the human health (Lakshmikandan et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020a). Therefore, the use of renewable energy to replace fossil fuel has become an inevitable trend for the green development of human society (Abomohra et al., 2020; Soltanian et al., 2020a). In recent years, waste recycling for energy production is receiving a great attention. Many studies focused on the use of waste animal and vegetable oils for bio-oil production (Usman et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020b). However, there are a wide range of energy-rich wastes that need to be investigated as energy feedstock (Xu et al., 2020b). During the production process of vegetable oil, activated clay is utilized to decolorize the crude oil. According to statistics, an average of 2%–5% of activated clay is consumed per ton of fat. The used activated clay is called waste clay, which is a kind of solid waste (Xu et al., 2020a). Due to the waste clay contains about 20–30% unsaturated fat, if it is handled properly, there will be pollution to soil and groundwater, and may cause a risk of spontaneous combustion (Abd Wafti et al., 2011; Mana et al., 2011). The oil squeezed out from waste clay is called clay oil, which is composed mainly of triglycerides (Wang et al., 2019). It has considerable yield, relatively stable components and is easy to collect, store, and transport. Therefore, the use of waste clay oil as a raw material to produce biofuels is of great importance for efficient reuse of resources and renewable energy production. At present, the commonly used preparation methods include the direct mixing, microemulsion, transesterification, hydrocracking, direct pyrolysis, and catalytic pyrolysis (Lakshmikandan et al., 2021). Among them, Pyrolysis technique has recently shown to be a potential alternative to convert waste oils into potentially useful fuel products and chemical feed stock, though the use of this technology is not widespread as yet (Jin et al., 2021; Lam et al., 2016). The catalyst used in catalytic pyrolysis is usually a molecular sieve synthetic chemical catalyst (Hu et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2020), which has the problem of the final disposal and/or elevated cost. Therefore, exploring eco-friendly catalysts at lower cost is of great importance. Recently, biochar was evaluated as a catalyst for pyrolysis upgrading, and showed promising results (Dai et al., 2019; Morgan et al., 2018). Compared with terrestrial biomass, algal biomass has received widespread attention as third-generation biofuel feedstocks with many advantages (Abomohra et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020c). In addition, the active components of the catalyst play a significant role in the hydrogen-free catalytic pyrolysis (Cao et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021). Metals are usually loaded on the catalyst to enhance its deoxygenation ability with higher decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions (Wu et al., 2016). Metals such as Fe, Cu, Ni, Zn are widely used in the modification of catalysts, effectively improve the activity of catalysts, and improve the quality of bio-oil (Liu et al., 2014; Soltanian et al., 2020b). So far, the effect of metal-modified seaweeds biochar-based catalysts on catalytic pyrolysis of waste clay oil was rarely studied. Therefore, the present study focused on biochar-based catalysts from seaweeds at different ratios of Cu(NO3)2 to provide higher activity. The activated seaweed carbon was prepared at different activation temperatures, then it was modified by Cu. The unmodified and modified seaweed char were used for catalytic pyrolysis of the waste clay oil. The catalytic pyrolysis products were evaluated and the mechanism of the seaweed carbon-based catalyst was suggested."
1,Experiments and methods,
2,Materials and catalyst preparation,"2.1 Materials and catalyst preparation The waste clay oil was provided by Taizhou Zhongcheng Oil Factory (Taizhou, China). Sargassum fusiforme was harvested from the East China Sea at the city of Ningbo. Biochar was produced in a fixed-bed carbonization furnace (Fig. S1), where 10 g of the dried seaweed was heated to 500 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C/min under N2 atmosphere and for 1.5 h residence time. After cooling down, the seaweed coke (5 g) was collected and mixed thoroughly with 2.5 g KOH. The mixture was activated in the carbonization furnace at 600–800 °C under N2 atmosphere for 60 min at a heating rate of 5 °C/min. Afterwards, the product was cooled down to room temperature, washed with deionized water, and dried in oven at 105 °C to obtain the activated seaweed carbon. The seaweed biochar obtained from carbonization at 500 °C and activated at different temperatures (600 °C, 700 °C, and 800 °C) was named Y600, Y700, and Y800, respectively. The activated seaweed carbon was modified with metal using the dipping method (Wang et al., 2018). An appropriate amount of Cu(NO3)2 ⋅ 3H2O was dissolved in 80 mL of deionized water, mixed with 1 g activated seaweed biochar, and kept in a water bath at 80 °C for 3 h. After drying, the sample was incubated at 600 °C in N2 atmosphere for 3 h. After cooling down, the modified activated seaweed carbon was collected and preserved in glass bottle until next use."
3,Catalytic pyrolysis,"2.2 Catalytic pyrolysis Pyrolysis experiments were carried out in a tube furnace (Fig. S2), using N2 as a carrier gas. The stainless-steel reactor was heated to the determined temperature and N2 was supplied at a flow rate of 0.8 L/min for 10 min to remove the air in the reactor. After reaching the desired temperature (550 °C), the flow rate was adjusted to 0.2 L/min and the feedstock was injected into the reactor. The generated oil was collected using a condenser system and the gas was collected in gas bags. The reactor was filled with quartz wool to stabilize the gas flow during pyrolysis and to easily separate the solid products. The catalyst was placed between the two layers of quartz wool to prevent its particles from entering the generated volatiles. The collected solid and liquid products were used for subsequent analysis."
4,Biochar characterization,"2.3 Biochar characterization Field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM; FEI NovaNano450; US) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEM-2100; JEOL, Japan) can effectively examine the microscopic morphology, surface characteristics, structural characteristics, and pore size characteristics. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area and pore size distribution analyzes (NOVA3000e; Conta, US) and analyze the average pore size and total pore volume through the corresponding analysis software. Laser Raman spectrometry (DXR type; Thermo Fisher, US) is often used to determine the degree of graphitization in a carbon material. X-ray diffraction (XRD; XRD 6100, Shimadzu Instruments, Japan) was used in the present study to analyze the element distribution and crystal structure of the activated biochar."
5,Pyrolysis product analysis,"2.4 Pyrolysis product analysis 2.4.1 Liquid product analysis The chemical composition of the biological oil was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) mass spectrometery (MS) using an Agilent 5975C with a triaxial detector (Cao et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2020). The GC system was equipped with an HP-5 UI column. The size of the chromatographic column used was: 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm. High-purity helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 3 mL/min. After the temperature of the GC sampler reached 300 °C, the pyrolysis oil dissolved in anhydrous methanol was injected into the GC-MS at an injection volume of 1 μL. The oven temperature was pre-programmed from an initial temperature of 40 °C–300 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min, then kept for 5 min. The MSD Chem Station integrator was used to analyze the data, and the compounds in the bio-oil products were identified according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology library. Heating value was analyzed using a ZDHW-6000 automatic calorimeter (Hengke Instruments, China)."
6,Gas product analysis,"2.5 Gas product analysis The collected gas was analyzed by a dual-channel gas chromatography system (Zhejiang Fuli Instrument, 9790II, China) using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) combined with a hydrogen ion flame detector (FID). The carrier gas was Ar at a flow rate of 0.1L/min, and the oven temperature was adjusted at 150 °C. A column (TDX-1, Fuli, China) was connected to TCD to detect CO, CO2, H2, and N2, while FID detector was connected to B column (capillary column, Fuli, China) to detect hydrocarbon gases below C4. External standards were used to quantitatively estimate the detected compounds in the gas."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Activated biochar characteristics,"3.1 Activated biochar characteristics 3.1.1 Morphological characteristics Fig. 1 shows the SEM photos of the activated biochar. It can be seen that the high temperature led to remarkably smaller particle size in Y800 than those of Y700 and Y600. The increase in the degree of the graphitization of seaweed carbon, because of the increase in activation temperature, reduces the mechanical strength of the carbon. Therefore, fragmentation easily occurs during the preparation process (Han et al., 2014). Compared with the original structure of seaweed (Fig. S3), the surface morphology of the seaweed char is considerably changed after KOH treatment, and the material surface is relatively smooth with a honeycomb-like structure morphology. KOH and high temperature completely destroyed the original structure of seaweeds and produced a large number of irregular and interpenetrating pore structures; thus, KOH can effectively increase the porosity and specific surface area of the product. The pores became more abundant due to the increase in secondary calcination temperature. This result indicates that temperature increase can intensify the activation reaction and of KOH with carbon atoms. 3.1.2 Raman analysis The Raman analysis of activated seaweed biochar at different temperatures is shown in Fig. 2 . Two characteristic peaks were observed at 900-1900 cm−1 (Fig. 2a), and peak fitting was performed which resulted in 6 obvious bands (Table 1 ). The intensity ration of the D and G bands (ID/IG) is usually used to evaluate the crystallinity or defect degree in the carbonaceous materials. Increasing of temperature from 600 °C to 800 °C decreased the ID/IG from 1.01 to 0.79 (Table 2 ), which indicates that high temperature enhances the degree of the aromatic rings formation in the biochar, which tends to increase the degree of graphitization and decreases the degree of disorder. As the activation temperature increased, the band position of G shifted to a high-frequency region, while D did not change remarkably because of decrease in the bandwidth of the amorphous structure during the carbonization process (Jiang et al., 2019). 3.1.3 XRD analysis Fig. 3 shows that the spectra of the activated char formed at the three studied temperatures are not much different and have two obvious diffraction peaks. The typical diffraction broad peak of graphite crystal plane (002) at around 21°, which indicates that the degree of graphitization of the material is relatively low and most of the carbon is amorphous. It can be seen that the 2θ corresponding to the 002 diffraction peak shifted from 21.4° to 20.1° as the carbonization temperature increased. Niu et al. concluded that the change in the position of 002 diffraction peak is caused by many factors such as different activation degrees of KOH at different temperatures, the expansion of the carbon lattice, the random distribution of aromatic carbon sheets, the decomposition of the ordered structure, and the doping state of heteroatoms on the surface of the carbon lattice (Niu et al., 2017). The other obvious peak is located at about 43°, which is the diffraction characteristic peak of sp2 hybrid carbon (100) crystal plane (Sadezky et al., 2005). Its strength indicates an increasing trend as the activation temperature increases; thus, the seaweed char, and the degree of graphitization gradually increased with the increase in temperature (Wang, 2019). In addition, the increase in carbonization temperature, increased the interlayer spacing, the graphitization degree, and the internal pore structure of the biochar. 3.1.4 N2 adsorption-desorption analysis Fig. 4 a is a curve of the nitrogen adsorption and desorption of the activated biochar using different carbonization temperatures. The adsorption isotherms under different temperatures are of type Ⅳ, which reflects the typical physical adsorption process. The strong interaction on the surface of the activated biochar rapidly increased the adsorption capacity under low relative pressure, and resulted in the convex shape of the curve, which indicates that a part of the activated biochar has a microporous structure (Ru et al., 2016a, 2016b). When the relative pressure was greater than 0.45, the desorption pressure was always lower than the adsorption pressure for the same adsorption amount. This is due to the “capillary condensation phenomenon” that occurs at high gas pressure. The effect of this phenomenon always proceeds from small pores to large pores, showing that the size of the pores in the structure is not uniform. The appearance of the H4-type hysteresis ring between relative pressure of 0.45–0.90 indicates that the structure of the pores in the activated biochar is not regular and that the material contains mesopores and macropores. The adsorption capacity also increased considerably with the increase in the activation temperature, which means the order of the activated biochar and the number of reversible pore structures. Fig. 4b shows the pore size distribution in the prepared activated biochar. The three samples showed a hierarchical pore structure, that is, micropores and mesopores are present at the same time, and the pore size distribution range is relatively concentrated around 5 nm. Table 3 shows the relevant parameters of different activated seaweed biochar samples. The results show that the average pore size of the activated seaweed carbon, which are around 3 nm, did not change remarkably at different activation temperatures, and all of them were around 3 nm. However, their specific surface area has increased greatly with the increase of temperature. Thus, the increase in temperature is conducive to enhancing the activation effect of KOH, which is in consistent with the conclusions obtained by SEM observation in section 3.1.1. The comprehensive results of the SEM, XRD, Raman and BET analyses confirmed that the pore structure and carbon structure of the activated biochar are the best when the activation temperature is 800 °C. Therefore, Y800 was selected to be modified with Cu and was used further in the catalytic pyrolysis."
9,Cu-modified activated biochar,"3.2 Cu-modified activated biochar 3.2.1 Morphological characteristics SEM after metal modification and secondary calcination showed that the surface of the biochar contained evenly distributed copper particles with a high degree of dispersion (Fig. 5 ). The density of copper particles on the surface biochar also increased with the increase of metal concentration. The abundant pore structure facilitates the passage of pyrolysis steam during the reaction, and the evenly distributed metal particles can provide a large number of active metal catalytic centers and fully catalyze the pyrolysis vapor. Therefore, Cu modification could enhance the catalytic effect in order to achieve an ideal decarboxylation and decarbonylation results, and promote the directional production of the final products as discussed later in Section 3.3. 3.2.2 XRD analysis Fig. 6 shows the XRD diffraction peaks of the modified biochar using different concentrations of Cu (5%, 10%, 15% and 20%). The obvious characteristic peaks of Cu diffraction appeared at 2θ = 43.3°, 50.5°, and 74.1°, which could be classified as the (111), (200), and (220) faces of Cu JCPDS (65–9026) (Jiao et al., 2021). This result shows that during the tempering process of N2 atmosphere, Cu2+ and the carbon element in the activated biochar underwent a reduction reaction to obtain Cu, and the reaction increased with the increase of Cu concentration. At the same time, all carbonized samples had a diffraction peak at 2θ = 36.34°, which was most evident in 20%Cu/Y800. This peak was the (111) crystal plane characteristic diffraction peak of Cu2O JCPDS (05–0667), which might be caused by the incomplete reduction of C (Yan et al., 2021). Based on the diffraction peaks of Cu(111) crystal plane, the particle size of copper particles was calculated by Scherrer's formula (Yashpal et al., 2015). The calculations showed that the particle sizes of copper particles were 40.8 nm, 38.6 nm, 39.7 nm and 41.3 nm when the impregnation Cu contents were 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%, respectively. Given the improved crystallinity of the samples and the high diffraction peak of Cu nanoparticles, a wide carbon peak was not observed evidently. 3.2.3 TEM analysis Fig. 7 shows the TEM images of the metal-modified activated biochar using different Cu contents. The non-modified biochar showed no specific morphological characteristics and was disordered (Fig. 7a). The dark round particles in Fig. 7b–e represent the copper particles. Compared with the non-modified biochar, the internal pores and surface Cu particles of the modified char are evenly distributed, and the copper particles became denser as the Cu content increased. The absence of metal agglomeration on the surface of the Cu-modified biochar may be due to the interaction between Cu and the carbon shell during preparation of Cu–char catalyst (Zhao et al., 2018). The pore size of the modified activated biochar enlarged to a certain extent and expanded more at the higher Cu content. This enlargement may be caused by the reduction of Cu2+ during the tempering process, which consumes part of the carbon. The scale bar in the figure shows that the particle size of the copper particles was about 40 nm, which is also consistent with the results obtained by XRD."
10,Catalytic pyrolysis of waste clay oil,"3.3 Catalytic pyrolysis of waste clay oil 3.3.1 Effect of catalysts types and ratios on the products yield In the present study, 10 g waste clay oil were mixed with 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 g of catalyst at a feed–catalyst ratios of 40:1, 20:1, 10:1, and 5:1, respectively. Table 4 shows the yield of the three pyrolysis products under different treatments. The different types of seaweed char-based catalysts have a greater impact on the products yield. The used ex-situ pyrolysis prevents the coke produced by the reaction from being affected by the catalyst; thus, the solid-phase product yield did not change significantly and was stabilized at around 3.5%. Notably, compared with the Cu-modified seaweed char-based catalyst, the yield of the liquid-phase of the unmodified catalyst was considerably lower. This result may be attributed to the rich pore structure and higher specific surface area of the activated seaweed carbon; therefore, the generated pyrolysis volatiles was catalytically reformed to promote the rupture of chemical bonds, deepen the degree of pyrolysis, and produce a large number of gaseous products. The increase in Cu loading under the same experimental conditions initially increased the bio-oil yield and then decreased. The bio-oil yield reached the maximum value at Cu loading of 15%. Compared to no-load Cu, while additional Cu led to a substantial increase in the yield of the liquid-product; thus, excess of Cu can inhibit the formation of gaseous products and obtain more liquid phase products. Zhang et al. found that the presence of Cu can inhibit the cleavage of C–C bonds when using Cu to hydrocrack oleic acid; and therefore, increased the yield of liquid products (Zhang et al., 2017). By analyzing the higher heating value of the liquid product, increasing of catalyst ratio substantially improved the higher heating value due to enhancement of the catalytic effect. However, too much catalyst led to a decrease in the high calorific value, because much catalyst deepens the degree of reaction, causes more hydrocarbons to escape in the form of gas, and therefore reduces the heating value of the liquid-phase product. In the unmodified catalyst, the maximum higher heating value of the liquid product reached 47657 kJ/kg using Y800 as a catalyst at feed–catalyst ratio of 10:1. Under these conditions, the content of carboxylic acid (Table S1) in the liquid product is remarkably reduced and the energy density is dramatically increased. In addition, the unmodified algae carbon-based catalyst has a deoxidation effect to some extent. Concerning the modified catalyst, the higher heating value reached the maximum of 48402 kJ/kg at Cu loading of 15% and raw material to catalyst ratio of 10:1; higher than bio-diesel and ordinary diesel (Lopes et al., 2013). This result may be because Cu loading enhances the deoxidation effect of the seaweed char-based catalyst. In addition, studies have shown that Cu-based catalysts can promote the catalytic effect of fatty acids, which resulted from the metal active sites on the surface of the catalyst that have a positive effect on the conversion of carbonyl oxygen atoms in fatty acids; at the same time, this is also an important way for fatty acids to be converted into fatty alcohols (Xin, 2016). Therefore, analyzing the products in combination with other analytical methods is necessary to determine the catalytic effects of various catalysts in the reaction. Because the modified activated biochar showed the highest bio-oil yield and the maximum higher heating value (Table 4), it was used further and the detailed characterization of all products was studied. 3.3.2 Effect of Cu-modified activated biochar on products characteristics Activated biochar has good decarboxylation and decarbonylation, dehydration, which reduces the content of carboxylic acids in pyrolysis oil to a certain extent and increases the proportion of hydrocarbons (detailed data in the supporting material). However, it still has shortcomings such as the low yield of liquid-phase products as presented in the previous section. On the other hand, Cu-modified activated biochar can effectively improve the yield and HHV of the liquid phase products during pyrolysis of waste clay oil. Therefore, this section discusses the effects of different copper loadings on the characteristics of pyrolysis products. 3.3.2.1 Liquid product analysis Fig. 8 shows the GC–MS spectra of the bio-oil obtained by the catalytic pyrolysis of waste clay oil using modified activated biochar at different Cu loadings as a catalyst. The spectra showed more obvious changes with the increase of Cu loading and concentrated at retention times (RT) of 0–10 and 20–25 min than other regions. The specific products are listed in Table S2. The bio-oil composed mainly of hydrocarbons, which showed the lowest value at 5% Cu loading (76.38%) and reached the maximum of 91.15% by increasing the Cu loading to 15%, which reduced again at higher Cu loading. On the other hand, acid content was the highest at 5% Cu loading (14.34%), and decreased to the lowest value of 2.23% at 15% Cu loading. This result shows that Cu can remarkably improve the decarboxylation properties of the catalyst. In addition, Cu has a good conversion effect on the decarboxylation of oleic acid and can promote the production of hydrocarbons (Zhang et al., 2017). Increase of acidic substances at high Cu load of 20% might be attributed to the increase in carbon consumed during calcination and reduction, which has a certain impact on the overall performance of the catalyst and reduces the conversion effect of acids. The other compound groups including esters, alcohols and carbonyl compounds, and their contents were relatively small and showed very low fluctuation at different Cu loadings. In the control (unmodified catalyst), hydrocarbon products are composed of long-chain hydrocarbons with small amount of cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Modification with Cu remarkably increased the content of aromatics in hydrocarbons, but alcohols, esters and carbonyl compounds in the product did not change substantially. The aromatic content reached the maximum value of 41.45% at Cu loading of 15%, which indicates that addition of Cu could promote the cyclization and aromatization of the product. Fig. 9 shows the carbon chain distribution of the main components in liquid products obtained from the catalytic pyrolysis of waste clay oil using modified activated biochar at different Cu loads. The carbon chain distribution of long-chain hydrocarbons is relatively concentrated between C7 and C15, which are gasoline products. This result may be attributed to the microporous characteristics of the seaweed biochar, which makes macromolecular products unable to pass through during the pyrolysis process. Therefore, multiple cracking reactions occurred until the products completely passed through the catalytic layer. Furthermore, some small molecules underwent polymerization reaction under the action of the catalyst to generate hydrocarbons with longer carbon chains. Concerning carbon chain distribution of cyclic hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons, the distribution of carbon chain length is related to the loading of Cu. When the load was 5%, the aromatic hydrocarbons and cyclic hydrocarbons were monocyclic and had longer branches, and with the increase of Cu loading, these long and branched chains could be further decomposed, so that the carbon chain length was concentrated between C8 and C12. 3.3.2.2 Gas product analysis Fig. 10 shows the main components of the gas produced from pyrolysis of waste clay oil catalyzed by modified activated biochar at different Cu loads. Methane and ethane contents decreased remarkably, while butane and butene contents increased substantially with the increase of Cu loading. This indicates that Cu hinders further scission of the carbon chain. In addition, the gas product contained only a small amount of hydrogen and almost no diolefins, which indicates that hydrogen production reaction was inhibited or the hydrogen radicals generated by pyrolysis under the action of the catalyst underwent an addition reaction. 3.3.2.3 The suggested mechanism of the Cu-modified activated biochar Compared with the direct pyrolysis product, the content of oleic acid in the liquid phase product decreased considerably after adding the catalyst. Therefore, three possible reaction paths of the catalytic mechanism of activated seaweed carbon were inferred by analyzing the reaction mechanism of oleic acid (Fig. 11 a). In pathway 1, oleic acid undergoes decarboxylation, decarbonylation and dehydrogenation to produce long-chain olefins and long-chain dienes that overflow with a large amount of CO2, CO, and H2. Long-chain olefins and diolefins undergo deeper cracking to smoothly pass through the catalytic layer of the activated seaweed carbon This craking generates a large amount of C1–C4 gaseous hydrocarbons and C6–C14 short-chain hydrocarbons. In pathway 2, C–C and CC in oleic acid are broken to generate gaseous hydrocarbons and carboxylic acids with shorter carbon chains. Then, decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions occur under the action of the catalyst, and the products further crack to produce gaseous hydrocarbons and C6–C14 short-chain hydrocarbons. In pathway 3, the hydrogenation reaction occurs first. The hydrogen generated at the beginning of the reaction undergoes an addition reaction with oleic acid to produce octadecanoic acid. Then, the octadecanoic acid undergoes the same reaction pathway 1 and 2 (decarbonylation, decarboxylation and deep cracking) to generate C1–C4 gaseous hydrocarbon molecules and C6–C14 short-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons. Compared with the unmodified seaweed char, more aromatics were present in the pyrolysis products of the modified seaweed char. Therefore, the formation mechanism of aromatics in the products is discussed. Li et al. showed that the active center of the catalyst has a key effect on the formation of products in the catalytic cracking of fatty acids (Li et al., 2019). The products are more linear hydrocarbons, and more methane will be generated when the strong metal center in the catalyst is dominant. In comparison, the dominance of acidic sites will enhance the degree of aromatization of the product and promote the production of propane. When Cu/Y800 is used as a catalyst, the copper particles supported by seaweed charcoal can act as the metal active center to deoxidize the fatty acids generated by the pyrolysis of fats and oils. This phenomenon also explains the large number of linear hydrocarbons in the product. As the reaction deepens, the metallic copper particles are gradually oxidized into copper oxide, and the active center provided by the copper oxide continues to react. Li et al. found that NiO provides acidic sites in the reaction and can promote the aromatization of the product when using NiO/HZSM-5 to hydrodeoxidize oleic acid (Li et al., 2020). Cu and Ni are in adjacent positions in the periodic table of the elements, and are transition metals; thus, CuO and NiO have similar properties. CuO can also provide acidic sites in the reaction, which will intensify the aromatization reaction and increase the production of aromatic hydrocarbons. Fig. 11b provides possible pathways for the formation of aromatics under the action of CuO. Aromatics are generated through two main ways, the first is through diene reaction. The conjugated diene is formed from the oil and combines with the produced olefin to generate aromatics. This reaction may also be one of the reasons for the increased yield after Cu loading into seaweed biochar. Thus, a large number of gaseous olefins generate aromatic hydrocarbons under the action of acid sites. Another way to generate aromatics is the cyclization of free radicals. After decarboxylation and decarbonylation, oleic acid produces intermediates with unsaturated CC free radicals, then, the intermediate undergoes cyclization and forms aromatic hydrocarbons through dehydrogenation reactions."
11,Conclusions and future perspectives,"In this study, the seaweed biochar with a large specific surface area and rich pore structure was used as a catalyst carrier. Copper modification showed evenly distributed metal particles on the surface of the seaweed biochar and prevented pore collapse, metal agglomeration, and pore blockage. The catalytic pyrolysis of waste clay oil was performed using Cu-modified activated biochar. The activated biochar without Cu modification showed a certain decarboxylation effect, which can reduce the acid content in the liquid products to a certain extent. The activated seaweed carbon promoted the rupture of C–C and CC, which resulted in low yield of liquid phase products. However, Cu-modified activated biochar not only showed an excellent decarboxylation performance, but also promoted the formation of liquid products with higher HHV. Thus, Cu can catalytically reform the generated small molecular hydrocarbons and increase the yield of liquid-phase products. The obtained liquid-phase product contained the highest hydrocarbon content using 15% Cu/Y800 as a catalyst at feed/catalyst ratio of 10:1. Hence, addition of Cu to the activated carbon as a catalyst can enhance the bio-oil yield and bio-oil composition which results in higher HHV. In future research, the catalytic properties of the catalyst can be further improved, so as to better realize the directional conversion of products and improve the catalytic efficiency."
