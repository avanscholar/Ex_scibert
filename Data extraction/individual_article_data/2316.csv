0,Introduction,"Post-industrialization depletion of fossil energy sources and the increase in carbon dioxide emissions owing to the use of fossil fuels have led to global warming, which is becoming increasingly serious. Therefore, new energy sources are being sought to replace fossil fuels. Hydrogen offers a clean and abundant energy source that can solve energy supply and environmental issues simultaneously [1,2]. Currently, most hydrogen is produced from crude oil refining and hydrocarbon reformation [3,4], which means that hydrogen production remains linked to fossil fuels and the associated problems of exhaustion of fossil energy sources and emission of carbon dioxide. In contrast, producing hydrogen by decomposing water would provide an almost infinite energy source. Hydrogen is most readily produced by electrolysis [5]. However, electrolysis uses electricity and the electrolytes and electrodes used in the process are expensive. To solve these problems, recently, research has been focused on producing hydrogen using sunlight and a photocatalyst to decompose water or lower-chain-length alcohols [6,7]. A typical mechanism of hydrogen production using a photocatalyst is briefly described as follows [8,9]. When light energy is incident on a photocatalyst, the electrons in the valence band (VB) are excited into the conduction band (CB). The generated CB electrons produce hydrogen by reducing water, and the resulting holes generated in the VB oxidize water to produce oxygen. The energy required for this process is ~ 1.23eV. Therefore, the band gap of the photocatalyst should have a value of at least 1.23eV to enable water decomposition and be within a range including both the reduction and oxidation potentials of water [10]. Various photocatalysts have been developed to satisfy these requirements. Among them, titanium dioxide (TiO2), with a band gap of 3.2eV, has emerged as a typical photocatalyst after significant research [11]. Furthermore, particles of TiO2 with various additional metal dopants, either added to the surface of the catalyst or within the TiO2 lattice, have been developed to improve the catalytic performance [12,13]. Despite the development of many TiO2-based catalysts, however, they have not yet reached the commercialization stage. Additionally, the photocatalytic decomposition of water over TiO2 is ineffective because the amount of hydrogen produced is limited by the rapid recombination of holes and electrons, resulting in the formation of water. To overcome this rapid recombination in water splitting, studies have aimed to improve the hydrogen production by the photodecomposition of methanol or ethanol instead of water [14,15]. However, the decomposition of light alcohols eventually leads to the generation of carbon dioxide. Thus, a separation step with hydrogen is essential, which, however, incurs an associated secondary cost. Therefore, it is necessary to design a breakthrough catalyst capable of decomposing water in an environmentally friendly manner to obtain hydrogen. For this purpose, many researchers have shifted their attention to alternative TiO2-free catalysts. Thus, we first synthesized ZnO, which has a band gap = 3.0eV and shows excellent optical activity, as a core catalyst [16]. However, the use of ZnO alone is insufficient to overcome the redox potential for water decomposition, necessitating the development of a sulfur-containing photosensitizer dopant that can react sensitively to visible light and can extend the CB energy of ZnO. Many reports have described the progression of metal sulfide photocatalysts, such as ZnS, CuS, SnS2, and Bi2S3, from synthesis to applications as a new photocatalytic reaction mechanism. These materials have narrow band gaps that allow the absorption of longer wavelengths, unlike conventional metal oxide semiconductor systems [17–20]. Although many sulfur-containing catalysts have been introduced and some satisfactory catalytic activity has been shown, the scope of research is still very limited compared to that of metal oxide catalysts. Recently, researchers have found that metal oxide/sulfide composites exhibit high photochemical activity [21,22]. Thus, we loaded Sb2S3 on the surface of ZnO. Antimony(III) sulfide, Sb2S3, has a band-gap (Eg = 1.7eV) that closely matches the maximum of the solar spectrum at Earth's surface and is known as a visible-light-sensitive photocatalyst in redox processes. For example, Kozytskiy et al. reported [21] the photochemical formation and photoelectrochemical properties of TiO2/Sb2S3 heterostructures, the photocurrent density of which is higher than that of a bare titania film by a factor of 3.6. Their heterostructures inhibited electron-hole recombination and reduced the loss of photo-generated electrons through unwanted reactions with the electrolyte. Huang et al. found that the bimetallic Sb2S3/Bi2S3-doped TiO2 and doped TiO2 powders show a much higher reaction rate for the photodegradation of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) than bare TiO2 under UV–vis illumination [22]. However, most Sb2S3 sensitizers are limited to organic decomposition catalysts and are rarely used as water decomposition catalysts. Furthermore, we found no reports on the photocatalytic formation of Sb2S3-based heterostructures and their photoelectrochemical properties. The present paper demonstrates the feasibility of loading Sb2S3 on the surface of nanocrystalline ZnO and focuses on the characterization of the structure, morphology, and optical and photoelectrochemical properties of the resulting catalysts using X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX/mapping), UV–visible spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL), and cyclic voltammetry (CV). Additionally, we propose that this catalyst overcomes the rapid recombination of electrons and holes during water splitting, leading to improved hydrogen production. Furthermore, we present the mechanism of electron transport during the photocatalytic reaction of this catalyst."

2,"Synthesis of ZnO, Sb2S3, and Sb2S3-photosensitized ZnO (ZnO@Sb2S3)","2.1 Synthesis of ZnO, Sb2S3, and Sb2S3-photosensitized ZnO (ZnO@Sb2S3) ZnO was synthesized by a typical hydrothermal method, as follows: zinc acetate (Zn(O2CCH3)2, 0.2mol, 99.9%, Junsei Chemical, Japan) was dissolved in water, and sodium hydroxide (0.3mol, 99.9%, Junsei Chemical, Japan) was added to promote hydrolysis. The mixture was stirred vigorously for 1h, after which the pH of the mixture was 10. The homogeneously stirred solution was placed in an autoclave, and the temperature of the reactor was raised to 200°C at a rate of 10°C/min and maintained at 200°C for 12h. After the reaction was complete, the final solution was separated into a powdered sample by centrifuge, and the sample was washed with water until the pH was near neutral. After drying for 24h at 80°C, the final ZnO powder was obtained. Sb2S3 was also synthesized for comparison by a method similar with ZnO as follows: the Sb and S precursors SbCl3 and thiourea (SC(NH2)2) were added to ethylene glycol in a ratio of 2:3, and mixed well, before being aged at 180°C for 8h. The resulting powder was then treated at 300°C for 2h under an argon atmosphere. The color of the obtained pure Sb2S3 was black-gray. Core@shell-structured Sb2S3-photosensitized ZnO samples (ZnO@Sb2S3) were synthesized by an impregnation method, as follows: ZnO (5.0g) was added to ethylene glycol (100mL) containing 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, or 10.0mol% antimony chloride (SbCl3, 99.9%, Junsei Chemical, Japan). After stirring for 1h, thiourea (SC(NH2)2, 99.9%, Junsei Chemical, Japan) was added to this solution as a sulfur source. The molar ratio of Sb to S was adjusted to 2:3. The solution was stirred again for 1h before it was placed in a dry oven at 180°C, and aged for 8h to obtain a powdery sample. This sample was rinsed with ethanol three times to remove residual chlorine and other impurities from its surface. The powder was dried at 100°C for 24h and then heat-treated for 2h at 300°C to obtain the final Sb2S3-photosensitized ZnO product. In conclusion, six samples were used as catalysts in this study: ZnO, Sb2S3, and Sb2S3-photosensitized ZnO (ZnO@Sb2S3) containing 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, or 10.0mol% Sb2S3."
3,"Characterization of ZnO, Sb2S3, and Sb2S3-photosensitized ZnO (ZnO@Sb2S3)","2.2 Characterization of ZnO, Sb2S3, and Sb2S3-photosensitized ZnO (ZnO@Sb2S3) The synthesized ZnO, Sb2S3, and Sb2S3-photosensitized ZnO (ZnO@Sb2S3) catalysts were examined by XRD (MPD, PANalytical, at Yeungnam University Instrumental Analysis Center) with nickel-filtered CuKα radiation (30kV, 30mA). The samples were scanned at 2θ angles ranging from 10° to 80° at a scan speed of 10°min–1 and a time constant of 1s. The particle sizes and morphologies of the ZnO, Sb2S3, and Sb2S3-photosensitized ZnO (ZnO@Sb2S3) materials were examined by HRTEM using a JEOL 2000EX TEM instrument operated at 200kV, and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL 2000EX). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of the catalysts was measured using a Belsorp II instrument. Nitrogen gas adsorption was measured using a continuous flow method with a nitrogen/helium mixture as the carrier gas. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS Nova, Kratos Inc.) spectroscopy measurements of Zn3d, O1s, Sb4f, and S2P were performed using a non-monochromatic AlKα X-ray source to investigate the oxidation state of the components of the synthesized particles. The atomic distributions of the ZnO, Sb2S3 and Sb2S3-photosensitized ZnO (ZnO@Sb2S3) were analyzed by elemental mapping images obtained via EDX (EX-250, Horiba). Diffuse reflectance UV–visible spectra were obtained using a Cary 500 spectrometer with a reflectance integration sphere. The recombination tendency of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs was estimated by PL (Perkin Elmer) measurements using a He–Cd laser source at a wavelength of 325nm. CV results were obtained using a BAS 100B instrument at room temperature and a scan rate of 100mV/s with KCl (0.1M) as the supporting electrolyte, platinum wires as the working and counter electrodes, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode."
4,Hydrogen production by photo water splitting using ZnO@Sb2S3 catalysts,"2.3 Hydrogen production by photo water splitting using ZnO@Sb2S3 catalysts The photocatalytic splitting of water was carried out using a liquid photoreactor designed in our laboratory, as shown in Fig. 1 [23]. For water photo-splitting, the powdered ZnO, Sb2S3, or ZnO@Sb2S3 (0.5g) was added to distilled water (1.0L) in a Pyrex reactor (2.0L capacity). UV-lamps (3 × 6Wcm–2 = 18Wcm–2, 20.0cm length × 2.0cm diameter; Shinan, Sunchun, Korea) emitting radiation at 365nm were used. The water photo-splitting reaction was carried out for 10h with constant stirring. The amounts of evolved hydrogen and oxygen were measured at intervals of 1h. The hydrogen and oxygen gases produced during water photo-splitting were analyzed using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD)-coupled gas chromatograph (TGC, model DS 6200; Donam Instruments Inc., Korea). The following GC conditions were used: TCD detector, Carbosphere column (Alltech, Deerfield, IL, USA), and the injection, initial, final, and detector temperatures of 413, 393, 393, and 423K, respectively."

6,"Physical properties of ZnO, Sb2S3, and Sb2S3-photosensitized ZnO (ZnO@Sb2S3)","3.1 Physical properties of ZnO, Sb2S3, and Sb2S3-photosensitized ZnO (ZnO@Sb2S3) Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the ZnO, Sb2S3, and Sb2S3-photosensitized ZnO particles. All the peaks in the XRD pattern of Sb2S3 could be indexed as the orthorhombic phase (cell constants a = 11.20Å, b = 11.28Å, c = 3.83Å; JCPDS reference code. 001-0538) [24]. The main XRD peaks at 15.8°, 17.7°, 22.3°, 24.9°, 29.5°, 32.5°, 33.6°, 35.8°, 37.1°, 40.4°, 43.2°, 47.3°, 53.2°, 54.5°, and 60.4° were assigned to the d200, d210, d220, d130, d211, d221, d330, d420, d231, d141, d250, d530, d531, d360, and d631 planes, respectively. ZnO also had high crystallinity, and was formed with a hexagonal structure (cell constants a = 3.24Å, b = 3.24Å, c = 5.17Å; JCPDS reference code. 001-1136) with main peaks at 2θ = 31.8°, 34.3°, 36.4°, 47.5°, 57.1°, 63.2°, and 67.8° [25]. The positions of the ZnO peaks in the Sb2S3-photosensitized ZnO particles did not differ from those of pure ZnO, and no peaks assigned to Sb2S3 were observed despite the addition of Sb2S3 to the ZnO surface. However, a trace of Sb2S3 was visible in the samples containing 10.0mol% Sb2S3, indicating the presence of many Sb2S3 particles dispersed on the ZnO surface. Fig. 3A shows SEM images of the Sb2S3, ZnO, and Sb2S3-photosensitized ZnO particles. The pure Sb2S3 formed cubic or rectangular rod-like shapes, ranging in size from 1.0 to 3.0µm in length to 0.5–1.5µm in width. Their large size seemed to originate from the formation of aggregates caused by entanglement between the particles, and TEM analysis (Fig. 3B) confirmed that the Sb2S3 crystals were approximately 300nm long and 50nm wide. The shape of pure ZnO was similar to that of Sb2S3, but its size was smaller, forming uniform 1.0 × 0.5µm particles. Moreover, the uniformity of the surface of these particles decreased depending on the loading of Sb2S3, and the size of the particles also increased slightly at higher loadings. The reason for these changes, shown in the low magnification-TEM image in Fig. 3B was that particles of Sb2S3 enveloped the surface of the ZnO rods as like core@shell structure, ZnO@Sb2S3 composites. Therefore, we suggest that as the Sb2S3 loading increased, the uniformity and smoothness of the particle surface decreased. In Fig. 4, to investigate the intrinsic crystal structure of core@shell structured ZnO@7.5mol% Sb2S3, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) (A), selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) (B), and elemental mapping image (C) are characterized. As shown in Fig. 4A-a, Sb2S3 crystals broadly cover the ZnO crystals, and further, the lattice of each crystal is clearly visible. One part was extracted and analyzed in detail as shown in Fig. 4A-b: the lattice fringes of 0.305nm (211 diffraction plane), 0.340nm (111), and 0.399nm (220) match well to orthorhombic phase Sb2S3, and the sets of lattice fringes of 0.279nm (100), 0.259nm (002), and 0.247nm (101) were assigned to hexagonal phase of ZnO [26,27]. The inset of Fig. 4B displays the SAED patterns of the pure ZnO and core@shell structured ZnO@Sb2S3. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern for ZnO in the inset in this figure confirms the presence of a polycrystalline structure with clear special spots. Otherwise, the obvious diffraction spots within these rings demonstrate that the ZnO@Sb2S3 is continuously polycrystalline with good crystallinity. On the other hand, the elemental mapping in Fig. 4C confirms that Zn and O elements are mostly present inside (dark color), and Sb and S elements exist mostly on the outside. Moreover, these elements are uniformly distributed. Thus, the HRTEM image reveals the microstructure and composition of ZnO@Sb2S3, further proving that ZnO@Sb2S3 was fabricated successfully. These results confirm that ZnO was present in the core and Sb2S3 formed a shell, with a distribution of Sb2S3 nanoparticles uniformly covering the top and lateral surfaces of ZnO. Fig. 5 shows the XPS spectra of Sb2S3, ZnO, and a core@shell structured ZnO@7.5mol% Sb2S3, as a representative example. The spectra showed stable baselines without noise and clear peaks corresponding to Zn, Sb, O, and S, confirming that each component existed in the samples. Fig. 5a and b show that the observed binding energies of Zn 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 in pure ZnO were 1021.8 and 1044.8eV, respectively, while the observed binding energies in 7.5mol% Sb2S3-photosensitized ZnO were 1021.58eV and 1045.58eV. The slight decrease in the binding energy and peak intensity of Zn 2p in the ZnO@Sb2S3 confirmed that Zn was present as ZnO at the inner surface of the ZnO@Sb2S3 sample. In the O1s spectrum of pure ZnO, the spectrum was deconvoluted to two components at binding energies of 530.3 and 531.4eV. The first peak was attributed to O2 − ions surrounded by zinc atoms in a hexagonal ZnO lattice, while the second peak is associated with chemisorbed or dissociated oxygen, or OH species on the surface of ZnO nanorods [28]. Fig. 5c and d further confirm the presence of Sb2S3 on ZnO nanorods. The observed binding energies for Sb 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 in the Sb2S3 sample at 528.8 and 538.2eV were assigned to isolated Sb. These peaks were split into two peaks at 529.6 and 538.7eV, which were attributed to Sb2S3. However, two peaks with very low intensity and corresponding to SbCl3 were also observed at 532.4 and 541.4eV. Thus, it was confirmed that a small amount of chlorine, which had not yet been substituted with sulfur, remained in the Sb2S3. On the other hand, the peaks shifted to higher binding energies in ZnO@Sb2S3, and the positions were attributed to a peak corresponding exactly to Sb in Sb2S3. Otherwise, broad S 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks at binding energies of 160.7 and 161.8eV were observed in pure Sb2S3, and these peaks were shifted to a higher binding energy in 7.5mol% Sb2S3-photosensitized ZnO. Consequently, the XPS results confirmed that the synthesized particles were ZnO with Sb2S3 and Sb2S3 on the surface in a core@shell configuration. The performance of the catalyst is strongly related to the ability of the reactants to adsorb on the catalyst surface. Larger surface areas allow a greater the amount of reactant to adsorb and, consequently, improve the catalyst's performance. Fig. 6 shows N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm curves at 77K for the Sb2S3, ZnO, and ZnO@Sb2S3 samples. The radius of the pore, in which capillary condensation occurs, can be determined as a function of the relative pressure (P/P0) using Kelvin's equation [29]. The mean pore diameter, Dp, was calculated from the relationship Dp = 4VT/S, where VT is the total volume of the pores, and S is the BET surface area. According to the IUPAC classification, pure ZnO displayed a Type II isotherm, corresponding to particles with no pores [30]. However, hysteresis loops were observed at higher relative pressures in ZnO@Sb2S3 samples, implying a Type IV isotherm. Furthermore, the difference between the adsorption and desorption curves increased as the loading of Sb2S3 increased, indicating the formation of bulk mesopores between the particles. The changes in the mean surface area and pore volume are listed in Table 1. In Sb2S3-photosensitized ZnO samples, the BET specific surface areas increased significantly as the loading of Sb2S3 increased. However, the surface area of pure Sb2S3, which formed large particles, was very small: The specific surface area of regular particles is typically related to the particle size, with smaller particles having a greater surface area [31]. The atomic composition of the external surface of the catalysts was analyzed by EDX, as shown in Fig. 7, revealing the presence of Sb and S in pure Sb2S3, and Zn and O in the pure ZnO. The composition of the samples was found to have Sb:S and Zn:O atomic ratios of 39.2:60.7 and 42.0:57.9, respectively, which are close to the ideal stoichiometric mole fractions of pure Sb2S3 and ZnO. Each component was found to be homogeneously dispersed in the EDX the mapping images of Sb, S, Zn, and O. The atomic ratios in Table 1 represent the real amounts on the external surface of the ZnO@Sb2S3 samples. The stoichiometric atomic ratios of these samples were not constant because of the varying loadings of Sb2S3 and because EDX only investigates the surface composition of samples. The catalysts used in this study had core@shell-type structures, in which ZnO was used as a core and Sb2S3 was the shell. Therefore, the amount of Sb2S3 on the surface is expected to be large, affecting the apparent atomic ratios in the EDX data. The amount of Sb2S3 present on the surface increased proportionally to the amount added to the catalyst, suggesting that these values are reliable."
7,"Spectroscopic properties of ZnO, Sb2S3, and ZnO@Sb2S3","3.2 Spectroscopic properties of ZnO, Sb2S3, and ZnO@Sb2S3 Fig. 8 exhibits the UV–vis spectra of Sb2S3, ZnO, and ZnO@Sb2S3 samples. The absorption by hexagonally symmetric ZnO normally appears at ~ 400nm in pure ZnO, and the absorption bands in the spectra for ZnO@Sb2S3 were similar to that of pure ZnO. The band gap in a semiconductor material is closely related to the range of wavelengths it absorbs, and longer wavelengths of light are absorbed as the band gap decreases. Consequently, photocatalytic materials with a narrow band gap can readily be used in conjunction with visible light, but a smaller band gap could reduce the photoactivity by increasing the recombination rate between electrons and holes. The absorptions maxima in ZnO@Sb2S3 were slightly shifted to a shorter wavelength compared to those of pure ZnO, although the broadened tail may indicate a sulfur component. The band gaps, obtained by extrapolation to the meeting point of the tangents from pure ZnO and ZnO@7.5mol% Sb2S3, were 3.09 and 3.18eV, respectively. Sb2S3, which has a band gap of 1.56eV, absorbed across the entire visible region and acted similarly to sulfur in the red color range. The utility of the CV results of pure Sb2S3 and ZnO particles, shown in Fig. 9A is highly dependent on the analytical conditions being studied since samples must be redox active within the experimental potential window. It is desirable for samples to display a reversible wave, which indicates a reversible reaction and displays a hysteresis of absolute potential between the reduction and oxidation peaks. When such reversible peaks are observed, thermodynamic information, in the form of the half-cell potential (E°1/2) can be determined [32]. Reversible curves were found for pure Sb2S3 and ZnO, assigned to the Sb(III) → Sb(0) and Zn(II) → Zn(0) redox processes, respectively. The CV tests confirm the energy of the HOMO (conduction band) and LUMO (valence band) of the solid particles [33]. Ferrocene (E1/2 vs. Ag/Ag+ = + 0.42eV) was used as an internal standard, and − 4.8eV was fixed as an energy level in the vacuum set. The energy levels of the HOMO and LUMO can be calculated using the following formula: HOMO (or LUMO) (eV) ＝ − 4.8 − (Eonset − E1/2(Ferrocene)). Here, Eonset is the starting point of the redox potential wave and is used more than the peak potential values. The onset potentials for reduction, measured against an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, in ZnO and Sb2S3 were − 0.28 and + 0.22V, respectively. The LUMO energy levels were, therefore, calculated to be − 4.1 and − 4.6eV, respectively. The results of the CV investigations support the UV–vis spectra, shown in Fig. 9A. The band gap of Sb2S3 was smaller than that of pure ZnO, and its valence and conduction bands were at energy levels than those of ZnO. This result implies that, in ZnO@Sb2S3, electrons were excited from the valence band of Sb2S3 to the conduction band of ZnO. Thus, the electrons can only recombine with the holes slowly, allowing the holes in the valence band to persist for a longer time than in pure Sb2S3 or ZnO. Consequently, the photocatalytic activity of the ZnO@Sb2S3 is enhanced. Fig. 10 A shows the PL spectra of the prepared Sb2S3, ZnO, and ZnO@Sb2S3. PL measurements are often used to investigate the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron/hole pairs of semiconductor particles. In general, there is a strong relationship between the PL intensity and photoactivity: the lower the PL intensity, the higher the photocatalytic activity [34]. The light-emitting wavelengths of different materials are different and, for comparison, the samples were all excited at the same wavelength of 275nm in this study; the emission peaks were located at a maximum of 468nm. The PL intensity of the ZnO was much higher than the ZnO@Sb2S3, possibly because of the new oxygen vacancies produced in the latter. The pure Sb2S3 showed the lowest PL intensity, and the PL intensity increased with increasing ZnO. The typical real-time photocurrent responses of Sb2S3, ZnO, and ZnO@Sb2S3 samples to a light source being switched on and off are depicted in Fig. 10B. In general, a response is generated when photogenerated electron-hole pairs are separated, and the effect of illumination is seen as an increase in current, which might result from photo-carrier generation as well as carrier mobility enhancement [35]. When the light was turned on, the photoreduction current rapidly increased, and then reached a steady state after a few seconds. Then, when the light was turned off, the photocurrent decreased instantaneously to almost zero. Under illumination, the pure ZnO exhibited the highest photocurrent up to the 4th cycle, which is typical of extrinsic semiconductors. However, the response decreased rapidly over time, indicating deactivation of the catalyst. On the other hand, the current density of Sb2S3 was very low but remained constant throughout the cycles. The photocurrent of the ZnO@Sb2S3 composites was initially smaller than that in ZnO and decreased as the amount of Sb2S3 increased. However, their sensitivity remained constant as the on-off cycle progressed, but the ZnO response decreased. The signal for ZnO@7.5mol% Sb2S3 was the highest after the fifth on-off cycle, suggesting that the separation of electrons and holes was accelerated in ZnO@7.5mol% Sb2S3. Eventually, this effect had a positive effect on the activity of the catalyst."
8,"Photocatalytic hydrogen production performances of ZnO, Sb2S3, and ZnO@Sb2S3","3.3 Photocatalytic hydrogen production performances of ZnO, Sb2S3, and ZnO@Sb2S3 Fig. 11A-a summarizes the H2 and O2 evolution from water photo-splitting over the Sb2S3, ZnO, and ZnO@Sb2S3 catalysts in a batch-type liquid photo system. The figure shows that, even after 10h, almost no hydrogen was generated by the pure ZnO and Sb2S3 catalysts, while a significant amount of H2 gas was collected for the ZnO@Sb2S3 catalysts. The amount of H2 produced over the ZnO@7.5mol% Sb2S3 reached 77.5μmol without catalytic deactivation. These results are encouraging. Recent publications have mostly investigated hydrogen production by decomposing light alcohols, such as methanol, rather than by decomposing water [36,37] because of the high energy (at least 1.23eV) required to decompose water. Therefore, it is very difficult to decompose water to obtain hydrogen stably using a general photocatalyst such as TiO2. Thus, many researchers have used light alcohol as a raw material for hydrogen production, and we have produced hydrogen by photocatalytic decomposition of methanol in many of our studies [38,39]. However, in this study, we confirmed that hydrogen could be stably obtained by decomposing water when a suitable amount of Sb2S3 is loaded on a ZnO catalyst. In conclusion, this study suggests that, if a suitable sulfur compound with good optical activity is coated on a ZnO catalyst, it is possible to produce hydrogen readily from water decomposition. The amount of H2 produced by the ZnO@10.0mol% Sb2S3 was rather low, despite the higher Sb2S3 loading. This result likely occurred because too many electrons were excited to the conduction band of ZnO at high Sb2S3 loadings, leading to the capacity of the conduction band of ZnO being reached and the electrons instead residing in the conduction band of Sb2S3. Eventually, these electrons relax again and recombine with holes, which leads to the inactivation of the catalyst. Therefore, an optimal loading of Sb2S3 exists. On the other hand, quantitatively, the amount of oxygen is half the amount of hydrogen. Our study showed almost the same results as shown in Fig. 11A-b. The amount of O2 produced over ZnO@7.5mol% Sb2S3 was 36.7μmol, and 18.0 and 32.3μmol, respectively, over the ZnO@10.0mol% Sb2S3 and ZnO@5.0mol% Sb2S3 catalysts. In the other three samples, however, the amount was negligible. Based on these result, we propose the mechanism shown in Fig. 11B. The smaller band gap of Sb2S3 (relative to ZnO) means that, when the light is absorbed, the electrons are excited from conduction band to valence band and then move to the conduction band of ZnO. Therefore, the recombination of electrons and holes in Sb2S3 is suppressed, and the photocatalytic activity eventually increases."
9,Conclusions,"We synthesized Sb2S3, ZnO, and core@shell structured Sb2S3-photosensitized ZnO (ZnO@Sb2S3) as a photosensitizer, core material, and photocatalyst, respectively, for application in the photo-splitting of water. TEM images showed that the morphology of Sb2S3-photosensitized ZnO was characterized by rod-like Sb2S3 particles covering a large ZnO rod surface in a core@shell arrangement. The CV results revealed that the LUMO energy in Sb2S3 was at a higher energy than that of ZnO, leading to a reduction in the rate of recombination of electrons and holes in ZnO@Sb2S3. Furthermore, a significant amount of H2 gas was collected over the ZnO@Sb2S3 catalyst, with a maximum production of 77.5μmol for the ZnO@7.5mol%Sb2S3."
