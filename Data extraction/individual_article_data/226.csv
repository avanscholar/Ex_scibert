0,Introduction,"In order to reduce the carbon footprint and fulfill the goal of carbon neutrality, much attention has been paid to the development and utilization of clean energy in recent years [1]. In this regard, hydrogen as the most potential energy carrier has been widely studied because it is a clean, efficient and renewable source of energy [2,3]. Therefore, hydrogen fuel can be used to power different mobile devices such as cars and motorcycles. However, one of the biggest obstacles to the widespread use of these environment-friendly devices is the storage and transportation of hydrogen. This is because hydrogen is characterized by low density, strong diffusibility, inflammability, and explosibility [4]. Fortunately, the in situ production of the desired amount of hydrogen from a stable liquid or solid fuel by a catalytic reaction can overcome the above-mentioned challenge effectively. Compared with other fuels like gasoline and metal hydrides [5–7], methanol is considered to be a more promising hydrogen carrier because of its advantages like sulfur free, no strong CC bond, high ratio of hydrogen to carbon and low temperature for hydrogen production. More importantly, methanol is liquid at room temperature and pressure, is safe and cheap and easily obtained from biomass, and can be completely biodegraded. Therefore, significant work has been done in research into hydrogen production from methanol by different catalytic processes, such as steam/water reforming, auto-thermal reforming, decomposition, and partial oxidation [8–11]. Among them, methanol decomposition is recognized as the simplest method to produce hydrogen due to the absence of any additional reactants such as steam/water and oxygen [12]. More importantly, hydrogen production from methanol decomposition realized at lower temperature possesses an operational convenience and economic advantage [13]. Therefore, it can be used in small-scale production of hydrogen fuel that has been used in various fields such as hydrogen fuel cells and hydrogen vehicles. In the case of hydrogen production from methanol decomposition, different Cu- and Pd- based catalysts have been intensively investigated over the past several decades [13–15]. According to previous reports [16–18], the Cu-based catalysts, such as CuAl and CuZnAl often show high catalytic performance for hydrogen production from methanol decomposition within the temperature range from 200 to 300 °C. However, most of the Cu-based catalysts are unstable in the methanol decomposition reaction. The sintering and aggregation of active Cu species are widely regarded as the main reasons for the fast deactivation of these catalysts due to their poor thermal stability and pyrophoric nature [18,19]. For example, despite slow-releasing behavior of spinel CuAl2O4, Wang et al. [18] found that all the CuAl catalysts prepared by different methods exhibited serious activity loss for methanol decomposition at 270 °C over 70 h time on stream, attributable to the sintering of Cu particles. Compared with the Cu-based catalysts, the Pd-based catalysts exhibit better thermal stability for hydrogen production from methanol decomposition above 200 °C [20]. But generally, the catalytic activity of Pd-based catalysts for methanol decomposition is lower than that of Cu-based ones under the same reaction condition [21–23]. Therefore, the development of methanol decomposition catalysts with high activity and stability, especially under the condition of relatively low temperature (<200 °C), is very much needed to satisfy the application requirement. Recently, the molybdenum carbide (MoC) as one kind of very important carbon material is extensively used in different catalytic reactions such as methane or alcohols reforming, water − gas shift reaction, biomass conversion, etc [24–28]. This is because the MoC has much higher electronic density of states due to the insertion of carbon atoms into the interstitial sites of Mo − Mo bonds, and thus exhibits noble-metal-like catalytic behaviors [29,30]. Just because of its distinctive structural and electronic properties, the MoC not only stabilizes the supported metal species (i.e., high metal dispersion) at harsh reaction conditions but also tunes their geometric and electronic structures (i.e., strong electronic interaction) [31–33]. Therefore, the MoC as a catalytic material for different energy-related reactions has more obvious performance advantage than other traditional oxide supports, especially in the areas of hydrogen production from methanol [34]. For example, Ma et al. [35] in their study established that Pt could be atomically dispersed on face-centered cubic MoC (i.e., α-MoC) and the resulting Pt/α-MoC catalyst exhibited much higher catalytic activity for aqueous methanol reforming than the Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/TiO2 catalysts, attributable to the synergy effect between the atomically dispersed Pt atoms and α-MoC. Moreover, Ma and co-workers [36] also reported that the 2%Ni/α-MoC catalyst with high density of isolated Ni atoms on α-MoC showed a high H2 production rate of 171 μmol gcat −1·s−1 for aqueous methanol reforming at 240 °C, which was almost 6 times higher than that of the traditional 2%Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. Likewise, they attributed this high catalytic activity to the synergy effect of the high dispersed Ni species and α-MoC on the 2%Ni/α-MoC catalyst. Similar to the report of Ma et al., in a series of studies on various metals modified MoC catalysts for methanol steam reforming, Abudula et al. [37–39] claimed that the Pt modified MoC catalyst possessed highest hydrogen production activity and selectivity, attributable to the presence of high percentages of α-MoC1- x phase and strong interaction between the Pt species and MoC. The above analysis indicates that the MoC, generally, exhibits strong mutual interaction with the supported metal due to its unique structural and electronic properties, which significantly increases the supported metal dispersion and the synergy effect between the metal and α-MoC. More importantly, the resulting synergistic effect at the interface of metal and α-MoC can effectively activate the methanol molecules [35,36]. Therefore, we reasoned that the MoC-based catalysts with high percentages of α-MoC1- x phase and high metal dispersion can catalyze methanol decomposition effectively. Meanwhile, given the good stability of Pd-based catalysts, and combining with our previous work [40,41], maybe the Pd-modified MoC catalyst is suitable for hydrogen production from methanol decomposition. To verify this idea, a series of Pd/MoC catalysts with different Pd contents were prepared and evaluated for hydrogen production from methanol decomposition in this work. More focus was placed on the structure-activity relationship and the stability of Pd/MoC catalyst for methanol decomposition. In addition, the reaction pathway for hydrogen production from methanol decomposition on Pd/MoC catalyst was also studied."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalyst preparation and characterization,"2.1 Catalyst preparation and characterization Preparation of the Pd/MoC catalysts with different Pd contents was performed using a temperature programmed reaction method published in the literature with a few changes [35,42,43]. In a typical experimental process, a certain amount of aqueous solution containing palladium nitrate dihydrate (12.5 mg, ≥ 39.5 % Pd basis, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) was loaded slowly on a self-made MoO3 support (1000 mg, the MoO3 support was synthesized by calcining ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate in air at 500 °C for 4 h), using an incipient wetness impregnation method under a vacuum condition [44]. When the impregnation process was completed, the obtained Pd/MoO3 precursor was fully grinded by an agate mortar in a water-wet condition to enhance the homogeneity of Pd species on the MoO3 support, and then immediately transferred to a vacuum drying oven and dried at 30 °C for 24 h. After calcination in air at 500 °C for 4 h, the Pd/MoO3 sample was loaded into a micro quartz tubular reactor and heated (5 °C min−1) to 350 °C in a flow of H2/Ar mixture gas (5/95 v/v, 70 mL·min−1) and held there for 2 h to reduce the Pd and Mo species. It should be pointed out that the purpose of the pre-reduction herein was to facilitate the formation of α-MoC1− x phase in the later carburizing process [41,45,46]. When the reduction process was completed, the resulting sample was cooled down naturally to room temperature and treated with a flow of CH4/H2 mixture gas (15/85 v/v, 70 mL·min−1), with the reactor temperature being raised (5 °C min−1) to 300 °C, and then increased (1 °C min−1) to 700 °C. After carburization in CH4/H2 flow at 700 °C for 2 h, the achieved sample was cooled down naturally to room temperature and treated with a flow of O2/Ar mixture gas (1/99 v/v, 30 mL·min−1) for 12 h. The obtained catalyst was labeled as xPd/MoC, where x indicates the approximate weight percentage of palladium. Besides the Pd/MoC catalysts, the Pt/MoC, Rh/MoC, Ru/MoC, and Pd-Pt/MoC catalysts with 0.5 wt% metal loading prepared according to the above procedure were presented for the purpose of comparison. In the preparation process of catalyst, the chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (≥ 37.0 % Pt basis), rhodium chloride trihydrate (≥ 38.5 % Rh basis), and ruthenium chloride (≥ 99.6 %), supplied from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., were used as the precursors for Pt, Rh, and Ru, respectively. To clarify the effect of support on the catalytic activity of MoC-based catalysts for methanol decomposition, the α-MoC catalyst was also synthesized by the temperature programmed reaction method published in the literature [35]. In addition, the supported Pd catalysts with 0.5 wt% Pd loading were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of the support (MoO3, Al2O3, and SiO2) with a certain amount of aqueous solution containing palladium nitrate dihydrate under the vacuum condition [44]. After impregnation, the Pd precursor was fully grinded and vacuum dried at 30 °C for 24 h, and finally calcined at 500 °C in air for 4 h. For comparison further, the CuZnAl and CuAl catalysts with n Cu:n Zn:n Al = 1:1:2 and n Cu:n Al = 1:2 respectively were prepared by co-precipitation method as in the literature [18]. Furthermore, the commercial CuZnAl catalyst with n Cu:n Zn:n Al = 1:1:2 purchased from SiChuan ShuTai Chemical Technology Co., Ltd. was used for testing in this work. For the sake of distinction, the commercial CuZnAl catalyst was denoted as CuZnAl-1, and the home-made CuZnAl catalyst was denoted as CuZnAl-2. Before the catalytic activity tests, the Cu-based catalysts and supported Pd catalysts were reduced at 350 °C for 2 h in a flow of H2/Ar mixture gas (5/95 v/v, 70 mL·min−1). In order to deeply study the structure − activity relationship in methanol decomposition reaction, the Pd/MoC catalysts after passivation were submitted to various characterization methods as described in the supporting information and our previous work [40,47]. In brief, the Pd content of Pd/MoC catalysts was determined by ICP-AES, using the aqua regia as digestive solution. After vacuum degassing, the BET surface area (S BET) and pore volume (V p) of Pd/MoC catalysts were measured by N2 physisorption at −196 °C. The XRD and Raman spectra were employed for the analysis of the phase compositions of Pd/MoC catalysts. The surface morphologies and internal microstructures of Pd/MoC catalysts were examined by SEM and STEM, respectively. In addition, H2 chemisorption was performed to determine the Pd dispersion of Pd/MoC catalysts. The surface chemical states of Pd/MoC catalysts were analyzed by XPS."
3,Catalytic activity test,"2.2 Catalytic activity test The catalytic activities of different catalysts for methanol decomposition were tested in a micro quartz tubular reactor as shown in Fig. S1. In a typical testing process, the calcined Pd/MoO3 sample and quartz sand with the particles sizes from 40 to 60 meshes were fully mixed and loaded into the quartz tube, which was vertically fixed inside a heating oven. Subsequently, the reactor was heated to 350 °C at a rate of 5 °C min−1 in a flow of H2/Ar mixture gas (5/95 v/v, 70 mL·min−1) and kept for 2 h. After reduction, the reactor was cooled down naturally to room temperature, and the H2/Ar mixture gas was switched to the CH4/H2 mixture gas (15/85 v/v, 70 mL·min−1). Then, the reactor was first heated to 300 °C at a rate of 5 °C min−1 and continually increased to 700 °C at a rate of 1 °C min−1. After keeping at 700 °C for 2 h, the reactor was cooled down naturally to 160 °C and purified with a flow of high-purity nitrogen (32.0 mL·min−1) for 1 h. Next, the liquid methanol after degassing was continuously fed into the vaporizer at a flow rate of 0.6 mL·h−1. The obtained methanol vapor was entered into the reactor with the flowing nitrogen. The mixed gases out from the reactor outlet were well cooled by a condenser. After drying, the mixed gases were on-line determined by a calibrated micro gas chromatograph (Inficon 3000). The catalytic performance of the catalysts for methanol decomposition was assessed by using methanol conversion, H2 production rate, and products (CO, CO2, and CH4) selectivity. Among them, the methanol conversion and products (CO, CO2, and CH4) selectivity were calculated by using equations 1 − 4 respectively, where F is the molar flow rate. (1) C H 3 OH conversion ( % ) = F CO, out + F C O 2 , out + F C H 4 , out F C H 3 OH, in × 100 (2) CO selectivity ( % ) = F CO, out F CO, out + F C O 2 , out + F C H 4 , out × 100 (3) C O 2 selectivity ( % ) = F C O 2 , out F CO, out + F C O 2 , out + F C H 4 , out × 100 (4) C H 4 selectivity ( % ) = F C H 4 , out F CO, out + F C O 2 , out + F C H 4 , out × 100 In addition to the catalytic activity test, the temperature programmed surface reaction (TPSR) of methanol on α-MoC and 0.5Pd/MoC catalysts was performed in a micro reactor to investigate the reaction pathway for methanol decomposition. In a typical testing process, 100 mg of Pd/MoO3 sample with the particles sizes from 40 to 60 meshes was loaded into the reactor, supported by the quartz wool. Subsequently, the reduction and carburization of Pd/MoO3 sample were the same as the experimental procedure of catalytic activity test. When the carburization process was completed, the reactor was cooled down naturally to room temperature, and the CH4/H2 mixture gas in the reactor was switched to the high-purity argon with a flow rate of 50 mL·min−1. After half an hour of purification, the saturated methanol vapor produced from a bubbler was carried into the reactor by the flowing argon for 20 min. Then, the TPSR of methanol was conducted by increasing the reactor temperature to 400 °C at a rate of 5 °C min−1 in a flow of high-purity argon (50 mL·min−1). The reaction products out from the reactor outlet were on-line determined by a mass spectrometer (ThermoStar GSD 320 T) and the micro gas chromatograph (Inficon 3000)."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Catalyst structure analysis,"3.1 Catalyst structure analysis As illustrated in Fig. S2, the physical properties of Pd/MoC catalysts such as BET surface area and pore volume were examined by N2 physisorption. As can be seen, all the Pd/MoC catalysts with 0.23 − 2.01 wt % Pd loading (see Table 1 ) showed a typical type IV N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm and H1 hysteresis loop. Meanwhile, the pore diameter distribution of the Pd/MoC catalysts was mainly concentrated about 5 nm, indicating that their porous structure was mesoporous. However, differently, the Pd/MoC catalysts with higher Pd content possessed lower BET surface area and pore volume (Table 1), which was probably attributed to the pore blocking by the high amounts of Pd species. As displayed in Fig. 1 , the XRD and Raman analyses were performed to identify the phase compositions of Pd/MoC catalysts. For comparison, the characterization results of α-MoC catalyst were also presented. In Fig. 1a, the presence of α-MoC1− x phase gave rise to evident peaks for α-MoC catalyst at 37.2, 43.2, 62.7, 74.9, and 78.9 ° (PDF#89-2868) [48,49]. For the Pd/MoC catalysts with different Pd contents, no characteristic peaks ascribed to metallic Pd and/or PdO were found, indicating that the Pd species were uniformly distributed on the surface of molybdenum carbide. Similar to the α-MoC catalyst, five noticeable diffraction peaks corresponding to α-MoC1− x phase were detected in all the Pd/MoC catalysts. However, it should be pointed out that the Pd/MoC catalysts with low Pd content showed higher diffraction peak strength (in terms of peak at 37.2 °) for the α-MoC1− x phase than the α-MoC catalyst, and the Pd/MoC catalysts with higher Pd content exhibited an opposite trend. Not surprisingly, similar behavior was also exhibited in the Raman analysis. In Fig. 1b, the Raman peaks centered at 80.0, 95.4, 112.7, 126.1, 147.1, 196.8, 235.1, 284.9, 336.5, 378.7, 663.8, 822.7, and 994.9 cm−1 were attributed to the presence of α-MoC1− x phase [50], and the α-MoC1− x phase was detected in the α-MoC and Pd/MoC catalysts. But compared with α-MoC catalyst, the Raman peak strength (in the light of peak at 822.7 cm−1) of the α-MoC1− x phase for different Pd/MoC catalysts were significantly increased at first and then decreased with the increase in Pd content. This indicated that the low Pd loading for Pd/MoC catalysts facilitated the formation of α-MoC1− x phase during the carburization process. By contrast, the solid-state transformation of MoO3 to α-MoC1− x phase in the carburizing process might be suppressed to some extent in the Pd/MoC catalysts with higher Pd content (see Fig. S3). To illustrate this further, SEM measurement was performed to observe the surface morphologies of Pd/MoC catalysts. As displayed in Fig. S4, all the Pd/MoC catalysts with different Pd contents exhibited the platelet-like structure with different sizes and thickness, which agreed with the morphology of α-MoC1− x phase [39]. However, it should be noted that the surfaces (see red circle) of 1.6Pd/MoC and 2Pd/MoC catalysts were more compact and their particle sizes were larger, which was markedly different from that of the Pd/MoC catalysts with lower Pd content. This phenomenon could be attributed to the presence of higher Pd content in the catalysts, which decreased the intimate contact of Mo and C species to a certain extent. Therefore, it was not easy to form α-MoC1− x phase in the carburizing process for the Pd/MoC catalysts with higher Pd content, as confirmed by XRD and Raman. As shown in Fig. 2 , the microstructures of Pd/MoC catalysts were analyzed by STEM and EDX. In Fig. 2a and b, it was evident that no Pd particles and/or clusters were deposited on the outer surface (i.e., the edge structure) of molybdenum carbide in the 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst, as verified by EDX element mapping. Instead, the Pd particles (red circles) of 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst were scattered on the bulk phase (i.e., the internal structure) of molybdenum carbide and its average particle size was only about 4 nm (Fig. S5). This showed that the Pd particles of 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst were highly dispersed on the molybdenum carbide. Similar to the 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst, the Pd particles of 0.2Pd/MoC catalyst were concentrated in the bulk phase of MoC and its average particle size was also about 4 nm (Fig. S6), indicating its good Pd dispersion. In Fig. 2c–e, the 2Pd/MoC catalyst exhibited many small Pd particles on the bulk phase of molybdenum carbide and its particle sizes were 3−7 nm. However, there also existed some big Pd particles with size distribution ranging from 8 to 17 nm on the outer surface of molybdenum carbide (Fig. S7), suggesting the presence of Pd particles aggregation. To provide further evidence on the Pd dispersion of Pd/MoC catalysts with different Pd contents, H2 chemisorption was carried out and the results are listed in Table 1. As can be seen, the Pd dispersion for the Pd/MoC catalysts was gradually decreased with the increase in Pd content, indicating that the more Pd loading was introduced, the lower Pd dispersion was. Among them, the 0.2Pd/MoC and 2Pd/MoC catalysts had the highest and lowest Pd dispersions, respectively. The difference in the Pd dispersion for the Pd/MoC catalysts with different Pd contents can be explained as follows. On one hand, as confirmed by XRD and Raman, the addition of small amounts of Pd to molybdenum carbide favored the formation of α-MoC1− x phase in the carburizing process, which possessed similar electronic and structural properties with Pd metal [26,51]. On the other hand, as verified by STEM, it was much easier to form the highly dispersed Pd particles on the bulk phase of molybdenum carbide in the case of lower Pd loading, which was attributed to the presence of strong interaction between the Pd particles and α-MoC1− x phase [52]. However, for the Pd/MoC catalysts with higher Pd content, large amounts of Pd species were inserted into the lattice of molybdenum carbide and occupied the Mo sites on the outer surface of molybdenum carbide (Fig. 2d), which decreased the intimate contact of Mo and C species. Accordingly, the interaction between the Pd particles and α-MoC1− x phase on the outer surface of molybdenum carbide was greatly weakened. As a result of this, the Pd particles break away from the bonds of the α-MoC1− x phase was more easily reunited on the outer surface than on the bulk phase of molybdenum carbide in the carburizing process. Therefore, the Pd/MoC catalysts with high Pd content exhibited lower Pd dispersion. In order to better understand the structure difference between the Pd- and Pt-modified MoC catalysts, the microstructures of 0.5 Pt/MoC and 0.25Pd-0.25 Pt/MoC catalysts were also characterized by STEM and EDX. As displayed in Fig. S8, the Pt particles of 0.5 Pt/MoC catalyst were largely concentrated on the outer surface of molybdenum carbide, and its particle sizes were in the 20−60 nm range, indicating the presence of serious Pt particles aggregation. Notably, some of big Pt particles were completely freed from the bonds of molybdenum carbide (Fig. S8a). This suggested that the aggregation of Pt particles on the outer surface was likely attributed to the weaker interaction between the Pt particles and molybdenum carbide. In Fig. S9, as confirmed by EDX element mappings and line spectra, the Pd-Pt alloy was detected in the 0.25Pd-0.25 Pt/MoC catalyst. Slightly different from the 0.5 Pt/MoC catalyst, the Pd-Pt alloy particles of 0.25Pd-0.25 Pt/MoC catalyst were scattered on the bulk phase and the outer surface of molybdenum carbide, and its particle sizes were in the 18−50 nm range. Also note that the Pd-Pt alloy particle sizes on the bulk phase were relatively smaller than those on the outer surface of molybdenum carbide. Combining all the STEM and EDX analyses, it was found that the introduction of Pd species was beneficial to inhibit the growth of Pt particle to some extent on the surface of molybdenum carbide. Moreover, keeping the metal particles on the bulk phase of molybdenum carbide was the critical step to obtain highly dispersed metal particles. As indicated in Fig. 3 , the surface chemical states of Pd/MoC catalysts were examined by XPS, where qualitative peak fitting was carried out to distinguish the element species. In Fig. 3a, the C 1s spectrum of Pd/MoC catalysts was fitted into four peaks, respectively, centered at about 283.3, 284.8, 286.7, and 288.7 eV. Based on the literature [53,54], the peak at 283.3 eV was assigned to the carbon in the carbide form, which confirmed the formation of α-MoC1− x phase. Additionally, the strong peak at 284.8 eV along with the weak peak at 288.7 eV was attributed to the adventitious carbon, and the small peak at 286.7 eV was related to the carbon in CO or CO groups that resulted from the passivation [55]. Significantly, the area ratio of peaks at 283.3 and 284.8 eV (see Table 1) for different Pd/MoC catalysts was gradually decreased with the increase in Pd content. This suggested that the more Pd loading was introduced, the lower percentage of the α-MoC1− x phase was, which was in line with the results of XRD and Raman. In Fig. 3b, the Mo 3d spectrum of Pd/MoC catalysts was deconvoluted into three pairs of peaks (Mo 3d5/2 and 3d3/2). Among them, the two peaks at ca. 228.5 and 231.6 eV were assigned to Mo 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks of Mo2+ species in α-MoC1− x , while the two pairs of peaks at ca. 229.3/232.2 eV (Mo 3d5/2) and 233.1/235.5 eV (Mo 3d3/2) were attributed to the presence of Mo4+ and Mo6+ species, respectively [55,56]. Evidently, the higher oxidation state of Mo for the Pd/MoC catalysts was due to the unavoidable oxidation on the surface. In Fig. 3c, the Pd 3d spectrum of Pd/MoC catalysts exhibited two strong peaks at ca. 336.1 and 341.4 eV that were assigned to the Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2 peaks of Pd0, indicating that the Pd0 was the main species. Furthermore, there also existed two weak shoulder peaks at ca. 337.8 and 343.2 eV, corresponding to the surface-oxidized Pd2+ species. This suggested that some of Pd0 species on the surface of Pd/MoC catalysts were oxidized to Pd2+. Interestingly, the area ratio of peaks at 337.8 and 336.1 eV (see Table 1) for different Pd/MoC catalysts was raised with the increase of Pd content. This result showed that the Pd0 species on the Pd/MoC catalysts with high Pd loading were more easily oxidized than those on the Pd/MoC catalysts with low Pd loading. One possible explanation for this was that the interaction between the Pd species and molybdenum carbide on the Pd/MoC catalysts with high Pd loading was relatively weaker, as confirmed by STEM."
6,Methanol decomposition study,"3.2 Methanol decomposition study 3.2.1 Catalytic activity test As shown in Table 2 , the catalytic performance of different Pd/MoC catalysts for methanol decomposition was evaluated at a temperature of 160 °C with a feed rate of 0.6 mL·h−1. As can be seen, the methanol conversion and H2 production rate for different Pd/MoC catalysts were gradually enhanced with the increase of Pd content. However, the opposite trend was found on other evaluation parameters of catalytic activity such as the selectivities to CO2 and CH4, H2/CO ratio, and average turnover frequency (ATOF). Among the catalysts examined, despite the lowest methanol conversion (11.4 %) and H2 production rate (35.7 mmol·gcat −1 h−1), the 0.2Pd/MoC catalyst exhibited the highest ATOF (1652 molH2·molPd −1 h−1) that was 6-fold greater than that of 2Pd/MoC (272 molH2·molPd −1 h−1). The difference in the catalytic performance of Pd/MoC catalysts for hydrogen production from methanol decomposition is explained below. As confirmed by XRD and Raman, the Pd/MoC catalysts with low Pd loading possessed higher percentages of the α-MoC1− x phase. Furthermore, more of highly dispersed Pd particles and high Pd dispersion were observed on the Pd/MoC catalysts with low Pd loading, as verified by STEM and H2 chemisorption, respectively. Therefore, it was understood that the 0.2Pd/MoC catalyst with high percentages of α-MoC1− x phase and high Pd dispersion exhibited higher catalytic efficiency for hydrogen production from methanol decomposition than other Pd/MoC catalysts. To clarify the structure-activity relationship of Pd/MoC catalysts for methanol decomposition, the variation of the ATOF with the Pd dispersion was analyzed and the result is displayed in Fig. S10. It was found that there was high correlation between the ATOF of Pd/MoC catalysts for methanol decomposition and Pd dispersion. This result indicated that the presence of highly dispersed Pd particles for Pd/MoC catalysts was the key to achieve the high catalytic efficiency for hydrogen production from methanol decomposition. Even so, the function of catalyst support (i.e., MoC) for methanol decomposition cannot be ignored. This is because the MoC, as a support for Pd catalyst, can effectively confine the Pd particles and modulate the electronic structure of Pd catalysts [52], thus affecting their catalytic activity for hydrogen production from methanol decomposition. As displayed in Table S1, the methanol decomposition reactions were also performed on three supported Pd catalysts with 0.5 wt% Pd loading to evaluate the function of support. As illustrated, these supported Pd catalysts (i.e., 0.5Pd/MoO3, 0.5Pd/Al2O3, and 0.5Pd/SiO2, Table S1, entry 2 − 4) prepared in this study were almost inactive at the same reaction conditions under which the 0.5Pd/MoC catalysts were operated. This suggested that the MoC support had an important and irreplaceable role in the methanol decomposition reaction. However, it should be noted that the substrate MoC (i.e., α-MoC, Table S1, entry 5) exhibited a very low catalytic activity for methanol decomposition (2.7 % methanol conversion at 160 °C). These results above clearly indicated that the high catalytic activity of 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst for hydrogen production from methanol decomposition (18.5 % methanol conversion at 160 °C) was the result of interaction of the Pd active site and the MoC. For the purpose of comparison, Table S1 also summarizes the catalytic performance of Pt, Rh, and Ru modified MoC catalysts with 0.5 wt% metal loading for hydrogen production from methanol decomposition. As can be observed, these modified MoC catalysts (i.e., 0.5 Pt/MoC, 0.5Rh/MoC, and 0.5Ru/MoC, Table S1, entry 6 − 9) exhibited lower catalytic activity (in terms of methanol conversion and H2 production rate) than the 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst. One possible explanation for this was that these modified MoC catalysts possessed poor physicochemical properties such as serious Pt particles aggregation for the 0.5 Pt/MoC catalyst (Fig. S8) and lower percentages of α-MoC1− x phase for the 0.5Rh/MoC and 0.5Ru/MoC catalysts (Fig. S11). As confirmed by STEM, this explanation was also suitable for the 0.25Pd-0.25 Pt/MoC catalyst whose metals particle size (Fig. S9) lay somewhere between that of 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst (Fig. S5) and that of 0.5 Pt/MoC catalyst (Fig. S8). Correspondingly, the catalytic activity of 0.25Pd-0.25 Pt/MoC catalyst (Table S1, entry 10, 36.7 mmol·gcat −1 h−1 H2 Production rate) for hydrogen production from methanol decomposition were intermediate between that of 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst (Table S1, entry 1, 39.4 mmol·gcat −1 h−1 H2 Production rate) and that of 0.5 Pt/MoC catalyst (Table S1, entry 6, 28 mmol·gcat −1 h−1 H2 Production rate). This result again showed that keeping highly dispersed metal particles on the catalyst surface was crucial to increase the catalytic activity of MoC-based catalysts for hydrogen production from methanol decomposition. Besides the modified MoC catalysts, three traditional methanol decomposition catalysts (i.e., CuZnAl-1, CuZnAl-2, CuAl) were also tested to benchmark the catalytic activity of Pd/MoC catalysts. As displayed in Table S1, very low methanol conversion (0.4 %) and H2 production rate (6.2 mmol·gcat −1 h−1) were obtained on the CuZnAl-1 catalyst, where the CO2 Selectivity and H2/CO ratio were, respectively, as high as 48.2 % and 29.2 at 160 °C, which was different from those of 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst. This difference may come from different reaction pathways for methanol decomposition performed on CuZnAl-1 and 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst (see below). In the case of the CuZnAl-2 catalyst, there were a decrease in CO2 Selectivity (44.3 %) and H2/CO ratio (24.6) and an increase in methanol conversion (1.9 %) and H2 production rate (16.6 mmol·gcat −1 h−1) compared to the CuZnAl-1 catalyst. Obviously, the catalytic activity of CuZnAl-2 catalyst for hydrogen production from methanol decomposition was much lower than that of 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst. Similarly, the CuAl catalyst also exhibited lower catalytic performance (Table S1, entry 14, 21.9 mmol·gcat −1 h−1 H2 production rate) for hydrogen production from methanol decomposition than the 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst at 160 °C, despite the high H2/CO ratio. For further comparison, the catalytic performances of the Cu-based catalysts (i.e., CuZnAl-1, CuZnAl-2, CuAl) and the supported Pd catalysts for methanol decomposition were also tested at different reaction temperatures (160 − 240 °C). As shown in Fig. S12, the catalytic activity (in terms of methanol conversion and H2 production rate) of 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst for hydrogen production from methanol decomposition was much higher than that of the Cu-based catalysts and the supported Pd catalysts in the testing temperature ranges. In addition, the reaction activation energy for methanol decomposition performed on 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst was only 51.3 KJ/mol (Fig. S13), which was significantly lower than that on the Cu-based catalysts. This indicated that the 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst possessed superior hydrogen production activity from methanol decomposition. Likewise, the catalytic activity of 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst for hydrogen production from methanol decomposition in this work was superior to that of other Pd or Cu based catalysts in the literature [13–18]. 3.2.2 Stability test As the catalyst stability was crucial for its practical application, the long-term performance of MoC-based catalysts for methanol decomposition was tested at a temperature of 160 °C and at atmospheric pressure with a feed rate of 0.6 mL·h−1. As depicted in Fig. 4 , the methanol conversion and H2 production rate, respectively, were decreased slowly from 2.7 % and 13.2 mmol·gcat −1 h−1 to 1.6 % and 10.4 mmol·gcat −1 h−1 after 25 h of running time on the α-MoC catalyst, where the H2/CO ratio was decreased with the increase of reaction time, suggesting the presence of slight deactivation. Similarly, despite the observation of relatively stable the H2/CO ratio over the reaction period, all the modified MoC catalysts with 0.5 wt% metal (Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru) loading also exhibited very slight activity loss (in terms of methanol conversion and H2 production rate) after 25 h of reaction time. Even so, it should be pointed out that the methanol conversion and H2 production rate of 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst were significantly higher than those of other metal (Pt, Rh, Ru) modified MoC catalysts after 25 h time on stream, indicating its excellent catalytic activity for hydrogen production from methanol decomposition. To illustrate this, further stability tests were carried out at different reaction temperatures and on the Pd/MoC catalysts with different Pd loadings, respectively. As displayed in Fig. S14, a relative stable catalytic activity for methanol decomposition was observed over 25 h of continuous running when the experiment was performed at different reaction temperatures (160, 180, 200, 220, and 240 °C) on the 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst, where the methanol conversion and H2 production rate were markedly increased with the increasing of reaction temperature. Likewise, all the Pd/MoC catalysts with different Pd loadings (0.2 − 2 wt%) also showed relative stable catalytic performance (in terms of methanol conversion and H2 production rate) for hydrogen production from methanol decomposition over 25 h of reaction time at 160 °C (Fig. S15). Moreover, to further verify the stability, longer-term test was performed on the 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst. As displayed in Fig. S16, the 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst exhibited a stable catalytic activity for hydrogen production from methanol decomposition over 360 h of continuous running at 160 °C. These results mentioned above suggested that the 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst possessed high catalytic activity and relatively good stability for hydrogen production from methanol decomposition. To assess the potential application of 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst, the long-term performance of three traditional methanol decomposition catalysts (i.e., CuZnAl-1, CuZnAl-2, CuAl) was also evaluated at a temperature of 240 °C. As shown in Fig. 5 , serious deactivation (in terms of methanol conversion and H2 production rate) was observed after 110 h of continuous running when the reactions were carried out on the CuZnAl-1, CuZnAl-2, and CuAl catalysts, where the H2/CO ratio was remarkably increased over time. For example, the methanol conversion and H2 production rate of CuZnAl-2 catalyst, respectively, were decreased sharply from 54 % and 81.1 mmol·gcat −1 h−1 to 9.7 % and 40.9 mmol·gcat −1 h−1 with the increase of reaction time to 110 h. By contrast, the 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst, whose the H2/CO ratio remained relatively constant over time, exhibited higher methanol conversion (88.2 %) and H2 production rate (107.3 mmol·gcat −1 h−1) than the above Cu-based catalysts throughout the test (360 h) on 240 °C (Fig. 5). More importantly, the 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst exhibited a good stability for hydrogen production from methanol decomposition, despite slight activity loss at the initial stages of test (<20 h). Specifically, after 360 h of running time under the testing conditions used in the work, the methanol conversion and H2 production rate for the 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst were still higher than 83 % and 102 mmol·gcat −1 h−1, respectively. One possible explanation for this good stability might be that the Pd particles were evenly dispersed on the catalyst surface, which was due to a firm bonding between Pd and α-MoC1− x phase on the 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst, as confirmed by STEM. In order to clarify this point further, the spent 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst after 360 h of reaction time was evaluated by means of different characterization methods. For comparison, the characterization techniques were also used to analyze the structure of fresh and spent CuZnAl-2 catalyst. As displayed in Fig. S17, the Cu particles of fresh CuZnAl-2 catalyst, just 4–10 nm in size, were evenly distributed on the catalyst surface, as confirmed by TEM and EDX element mapping. However, similar to the literature results [18,19], the spent CuZnAl-2 catalyst after 110 h of continuous running at 240 °C underwent serious Cu particles aggregation and the Cu particle size was as high as 30 nm or above, as verified by TEM and XRD analyses (Fig. S18). Obviously, the sintering of Cu particles was the main reason for the deactivation of CuZnAl-2 catalyst in the production of hydrogen from methanol decomposition (Fig. 5). Different from the spent CuZnAl-2 catalyst, the spent 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst after 360 h of running time still exhibited a good Pd dispersion on the catalyst surface, despite the presence of small amounts of Pd particles aggregation on the external surface of MoC, as confirmed by the STEM and EDX element mapping (Fig. S19). The explanation for this good Pd dispersion on the spent 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst was likely attributed to the presence of strong interaction between the Pd particles and α-MoC1− x phase. However, it should be noted that the microstructure of 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst has undertaken some changes after 360 h of running time at 240 °C. For example, the spent 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst had a more compact and fragmented platelet-like structure than that of the fresh one, as verified by SEM (Fig. S19a). In addition, the XRD analysis indicated that the peak intensity of α-MoC1− x phase in the spent 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst was weaker than that in the fresh one (Fig. S19b). In contrast, the spent 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst exhibited stronger Mo 3d peak at 232 − 238 eV corresponding to the Mo4+ and/or Mo6+ species than the fresh one, as confirmed by XPS (Fig. S19c). These results above suggested that part of α-MoC1− x phase in the 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst has changed (i.e., underwent oxidation and/or transformed to other phases) after 360 h of reaction time, which might have led to a slight decrease in catalytic activity at the initial stages of test. In addition, the presence of small amounts of Pd particles aggregation on the 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst was probably one reason for the slight activity loss in the initial reaction period. But anyway, the comparison experiments above have demonstrated that the 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst exhibited high catalytic activity and stability for hydrogen production from methanol decomposition, which caused it to have potential application prospect. 3.2.3 Proposed reaction pathway At present, the hydrogen production from methanol on catalyst has been widely investigated in the literature [57–60]. Along with the production of hydrogen, different reaction products such as CO, CO2, dimethyl ether, methyl formate, and dimethoxymethane can be produced from methanol [61–64]. Accordingly, coincident with different reaction products, the reaction pathways for the production of hydrogen from methanol are also varied. Despite many years of research, the reaction pathway for methanol decomposition to H2 and CO was still in controversy because the aldehyde (HCHO) species, considered to be an important intermediate of methanol decomposition, possessed different transformation processes. For example, the aldehyde species derived from methanol can desorb to the gas phase, or react with the methoxy group (CH3O) to produce methyl formate (HCOOCH3), or directly convert to H2 and CO [65]. To explore the reaction pathway of methanol decomposition, the CH3OH − TPSR tests on the α-MoC and 0.5Pd/MoC catalysts were carried out and the results are displayed in Fig. 6 . As can be seen, both the α-MoC and 0.5Pd/MoC catalysts exhibited two strong H2 and CO signals and two relatively weak CO2 and CH4 signals above 160 °C (Fig. 6a and d), indicating that the CO2 and CH4 are the main byproducts of methanol decomposition. However, the big difference is that the signal intensities of H2 and CO for the 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst were significantly stronger than those for the α-MoC catalyst at the same testing temperature (< 280 °C). Meanwhile, compared with the α-MoC catalyst, the H2 and CO signals of 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst were shifted to lower temperature. This suggested that the 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst exhibited higher catalytic activity for methanol decomposition than the α-MoC catalyst, which was in agreement with the results of activity test (Table S1). Besides the difference in H2 and CO signals, it can be observed from Fig. 6 that the main difference for CH3OH − TPSR tests on the α-MoC and 0.5Pd/MoC catalysts was the signal intensities of H2O, C2H6, CH3OCH3, HCOOH, and HCOOCH3. For example, the α-MoC catalyst exhibited an evident signal corresponding to H2O above 250 °C (Fig. 6a), which was attributed to the inter-molecular dehydration of methanol (Eq. (5)). Accordingly, a very weak signal corresponding to CH3OCH3 was detected above 250 °C in the case of α-MoC catalyst (Fig. 6b). By comparison, the signal intensities of H2O and CH3OCH3 for the 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst were much lower than those for the α-MoC catalyst (Fig. 6d and e). Moreover, the H2O and CH3OCH3 signals of 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst were mainly concentrated between 170 and 300 °C. This result indicated that it was not easy to produce water from the inter-molecular dehydration of methanol on 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst. Similarly, the 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst exhibited weaker HCOOH and HCOOCH3 signals than the α-MoC catalyst. Furthermore, the HCOOH and HCOOCH3 signals of 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst were also moved to the aspect of the low temperature. These results above suggested that the transformations of HCOOH and HCOOCH3 to H2, CO, CO2, and CH4 (Eqs. (6)–(10)) were occurred more easily on the 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst, which was most likely due to the presence of Pd active sites. Interestingly, no evident signal corresponding to HCHO was detected throughout the TPSR test period. The explanation for this could be because the HCHO as the intermediate of methanol decomposition was ephemeral and rapidly transformed into methyl formate and/or CO and H2. In addition, despite an extremely low selectivity detected by GC (Fig. 6c and f), both the α-MoC and 0.5Pd/MoC catalysts exhibited weak signal corresponding to C2H6 above 200 °C, indicating the presence of CC coupling of methanol.

As can be observed, the methanol was dissociative adsorbed on the α-MoC1- x sites of 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst, and underwent the cleavage of the OH bond to produce the methoxy group. During this process, the inter-molecular dehydration of methanol was greatly inhibited due to the presence of Pd active sites, as confirmed by TPSR test (Fig. 6d and e). Conversely, the methoxyl groups derived from methanol were easily dehydrogenated to produce the aldehyde species on Pd active sites of 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst. By comparison, the dehydrogenation of methoxyl groups was less likely to occur on the α-MoC catalyst due to the lack of Pd active sites. Based on previous report [66], the cleavage of CH bond in methoxyl group is recognized as the rate-determining step for methanol decomposition. Therefore, it was understood that the catalytic activity of 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst for methanol decomposition was much higher than that of α-MoC (Table S1). By the aid of Pd active sites, the aldehyde species was quickly reacted with another methoxyl group at the interface with α-MoC1- x sites to produce the methyl formate. But in the meantime, the possibility that the aldehyde species was directly decomposed into H2 and CO cannot be ruled out (Eqs. (11) and (12)). Based on the TPSR test where the signals corresponding to HCOOCH3 and CH4 were detected, the aldehyde species on Pd active sites of 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst was more likely to convert to methyl formate. Subsequently, the resulting methyl formate was further decomposed into CO, CO2, and CH4 and released H2 (Eqs. (6)–(8)). In addition, due to the presence of little water that derived from the inter-molecular dehydration of methanol, a small amount of methyl formate can be hydrolyzed to formic acid, which was finally decomposed to H2 and CO2. However, it should be pointed out that the formation rate of CO2 from formic acid and/or methyl formate was significantly lower than that of CO from methyl formate on 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst, which might be due to the effect of reverse water-gas shift reaction (Eq. (13)). Accordingly, the selectivity to CO2 was remarkably lower than that to CO, as confirmed by catalytic activity test (Table S1)."
7,Conclusions,"In this study, the Pd/MoC catalysts with different Pd loadings were synthesized and tested for hydrogen production from methanol decomposition at low temperature. By means of various characterization techniques, it has been proven that more α-MoC1− x phase and highly dispersed Pd particles were formed in the Pd/MoC catalysts with lower Pd loading, which showed superior hydrogen production activity for methanol decomposition at low temperature. Specifically, the Pd particles size of 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst with high percentages of α-MoC1− x phase was only about 4 nm and its average turnover frequency reached up to 807 molH2·molPd −1 h−1 when methanol decomposition was performed at 160 °C. But under the same reaction conditions, the traditional CuZnAl catalyst was almost inactive (< 2 % methanol conversion). Moreover, the traditional CuZnAl catalyst underwent significant deactivation over 110 h of running time at a temperature of 240 °C, which was mainly due to the sintering of Cu particles. In contrast, the 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst exhibited a stable catalytic activity for hydrogen production from methanol decomposition over 360 h of continuous running at 240 °C, which was attributed to the presence of strong interaction between the Pd particles and α-MoC1− x phase. Therefore, combined with the results of activity and stability tests, the 0.5Pd/MoC catalyst exhibited a considerable prospect that it can be used in the production of hydrogen from methanol decomposition."
