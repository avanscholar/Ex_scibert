0,Introduction,"Banana (Musa spp.) belongs to Musa genus in Musa family. It is the most widely grown and consumed fruit in the world (Luo, Li, & Du, 2015; Mathew & Negi, 2017). Bananas are rich in nutrients such as starch, phenols, dietary fiber, carotenoids, minerals and trace elements, which plays an important role in maintaining human health (Qamar & Shaikh, 2018). However, due to mechanical, microbial and physiological damage, the post-harvest losses of fruit account for about 20–40%, resulting in huge economic losses (Bose, Howlader, & Wang, 2021). Coating is a fruit preservation technology that has developed rapidly in recent years (Luo, Wang, & Jiang, 2015). The coating liquid is attached to the surface of the fruit by soaking, brushing, and spraying to form a semi-permeable film, which reduces mechanical damage, inhibits gas exchange and prevents microbial infection, thus achieving the purpose of keeping fruit fresh (Lo Ay & Dawood, 2019). This technology has been widely studied because of its low cost, remarkable effect, safety and non-toxicity (Md Nor & Ding, 2020). Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a water-soluble high molecular polymer, which is obtained from polyvinyl ester under acid or alkali hydrolysis. It has the advantages of easy film formation, edible, strong mechanical properties, and good chemical resistance. (Moreira, Pereira-Júnior, & Fernandes, 2020). Since it was approved by FDA could be used as food packaging material in close contact with food, the research on PVA coating is increasing gradually. Lo’ay et.al. prepared CS/PVA/SA coating solution by blending salicylic acid (SA) with chitosan (CS) and PVA, and it was applied to the grape preservation (Lo’ay & El-Khateeb, 2018). The results showed that CS/PVA/SA coating effectively reduced water loss, inhibited cell wall enzyme activity and phenolic oxidation, thus delaying fruit ripening. The coating can indeed delay the ripening of fruits and vegetables to a certain extent. However, bananas are typical climacteric fruits. After harvest, the self-catalytic ethylene production increased sharply. Ethylene acts as a signal-inducing molecule to trigger a cascade of fruit and vegetable development, which in turn causes a series of irreversible damage to the physical and chemical properties and nutritional quality of the fruit (Min, Zhu, & Sun, 2020). Therefore, how to reduce and even remove the gas ethylene in the storage environment is the key factor to extend the shelf life of bananas. Photocatalytic technology has been proved to have good mineralization ability for ethylene (Zhou, Yuan, & Chen, 2020). In previous research, our group successfully synthesized TiO2/Bi2WO6 heterojunction microspheres by hydrothermal and self-deposition method and applied them to the degradation of ethylene. The ethylene degradation rate under visible light was 20.90%, which was significantly higher than that of TiO2 (4.22%) and Bi2WO6 (13.69%) (Wang, Xu, & Xie, 2020). However, the visible light utilization of TiO2/Bi2WO6 photocatalyst is insufficient and the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers of single heterojunction photocatalyst is poor, which is difficult to be applied in practice. As a silver-based photocatalyst, Ag2O has a narrow band gap (only 1.2 eV), a wide spectral response range (absorbing part of infrared light), and high photooxidation ability. Therefore, it can be used as a photosensitizer to construct multiple heterojunctions with other wide band gap semiconductors to improve the photocatalytic activity (Xu, Wang, & Wang, 2021). Zhang et al. successfully synthesized Ag2O/Ag2S/CuBi2O4 heterojunction photocatalyst by hydrothermal and co-precipitation method (Zhang, Hao, & Yang, 2021). Compared with pure CuBi2O4 and Ag2S, Ag2O/Ag2S/CuBi2O4 has enhanced near-infrared light absorption, significantly increased photocurrent intensity and carrier separation efficiency, and showed better photocatalytic degradation effect of rhodamine B (99.2%) and Cr(VI) (53%). Therefore, we propose to construct a novel Ag2O/TiO2/Bi2WO6 composite photocatalyst with high carrier separation efficiency, and expect it to have a good photocatalytic degradation effect of ethylene. At present, the research on fruit coating mainly focuses on adding antimicrobial materials or antioxidants to the coating solution to achieve the purpose of preservation. The proposal of this research is to add inorganic photocatalyst into the PVA matrix and combine photocatalysis with coating technology to prepare a composite PVA coating material with excellent photocatalytic degradation performance of ethylene. It is expected that the composite coating would effectively inhibit gas exchange and eliminate ethylene, which changing the gas micro-environment inside the membrane and extending the shelf life of bananas. This new type of fruit preservation technology has not been reported yet. Herein, the Ag2O-TiO2-Bi2WO6 (ATB) microsphere photocatalyst was fabricated by hydrothermal and surface deposition methods, and the ATB/PVA composite film was constructed by the casting method. The structural characteristics of ATB and ATB/PVA composite films were analyzed by a series of characterization techniques. The ethylene photocatalytic degradation performance of ATB/PVA film and the banana preservation effect with ATB/PVA coating were evaluated under LED light irradiation."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The experimental bananas were purchased from a local farmers' market in Guangzhou, China. All banana samples have uniform size, same maturity and no surface mechanical damage, which were washed with distilled water and dried before the experiment. PVA 350 (GR, degree of hydrolysis is 98–98.8%) was obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagents, China. Gallic acid and glucose standards were provided by Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd., China. All other chemical reagents are of analytical grade."
3,Preparation of Ag2O-TiO2-Bi2WO6/PVA composite film,"2.2 Preparation of Ag2O-TiO2-Bi2WO6/PVA composite film 2.2.1 Synthesis of Ag2O-TiO2-Bi2WO6 photocatalyst Synthesis of TiO2-Bi2WO6 microsphere: Na2WO4·2H2O and Bi(NO3)3·5H2O with molar ratio of 1:2 were dissolved in 200 mL distilled water and HNO3 (0.4 mol/L) solution, respectively. The colorless and transparent solutions obtained were recorded as liquid A and liquid B, respectively. Liquid A was added to liquid B dropwise, and the mixed solution was dispersed by ultrasound at 400 W for 30 min, then poured into the reactor for hydrothermal reaction at 160°C for 15 h. After the reaction was completed, 10% TiO2 (P25, Degussa, Germany) was added (based on the mass of Bi2WO6 precursor), and the mixture was dispersed by ultrasonic for 30 min, then set for 1 h. The precipitate was centrifugally washed with distilled water and anhydrous ethanol for several times, and then calcined at 450°C for 3 h. The TiO2-Bi2WO6 composite microsphere photocatalyst was obtained, denoted as TB. Without adding P25 in the above process, Bi2WO6 microspheres were obtained. Synthesis of Ag2O-TiO2-Bi2WO6 microsphere: 1 g TB powder and 0.03 g PVP-K30 were added into 100 mL AgNO3 solution (0.15 mg/L). After magnetic stirring for 15 min and ultrasonic dispersed at 400 W for 30 min. Then, 100 mL (1 M) NaOH solution was added dropwise in the stirring process. After standing for 1 h, the precipitate was washed with distilled water and absolute ethanol by centrifugation. After drying, Ag2O-TiO2-Bi2WO6 microspheres were obtained, which was denoted as ATB. 2.2.2 Preparation of ATB/PVA film Preparation of ATB dispersion: ATB photocatalyst and 20%PVP-K30 (based on the mass of ATB powder) were dispersed in 30 mL distilled water, and then the mixture was stirred for 15 min and dispersed for 30 min with 400 W ultrasonic power to obtain stable ATB aqueous dispersion. Preparation of ATB/PVA film: 6 g PVA, 30 mL ATB dispersion and 60 mL distilled water were mixed, heated and stirred in a water bath at 95°C for 30 min, followed by ultrasonic defoaming for 15 min to prepare a uniformly mixed film forming solution. 25 g of the membrane forming solution was poured in a polyethylene petri dish (Φ125) and placed in an oven at 50°C to dry for 8 h. A series of ATB/PVA composite films with different ATB doping amounts were obtained by controlling the ATB doping amount (0.5, 1, 3, 5, 7 wt%), which were respectively defined as 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 7%ATB/PVA. According to the above steps, a blank PVA film was prepared without adding ATB dispersion."
4,Photocatalytic degradation of ethylene by ATB/PVA film,"2.3 Photocatalytic degradation of ethylene by ATB/PVA film As shown in Fig. S1a, the self-made photocatalytic reactor (5L) was placed in an environment with a temperature of 20 °C and a relative humidity of 50%. A circulating fan was installed at the bottom of the reactor to accelerate the gas flow. Five bananas with the same degree of maturity were placed in the middle of reactor, and each with a mass of about 120 ± 5 g and a total mass of about 600 ± 10 g. A photocatalytic film was located on the upper platform of the container and then the container was sealed with a quartz glass. Turned on the LED light source (50 W, 380＜λ＜780 nm, effective light intensity is 15 mW/cm2), 2 mL gas was extracted with a sampling needle and injected into a gas chromatograph (Shanghai Tianmei, GC-7900, FID detector) to detect the initial concentration of ethylene in the reactor. After that, the concentration of ethylene was detected every 24 h and lasted for 8 days to observe the change of ethylene concentration."
5,Banana preservation experiment,"2.4 Banana preservation experiment The film-forming solution was prepared according to the method in Section 2.2.2 and bananas were divided into five groups with different treatments. Group A (blank) was not coated; Group B, C, D, E and F were treated with PVA, TiO2/PVA, Bi2WO6/PVA, TB/PVA and ATB/PVA coatings, respectively. A wool brush was used to spread coating solutions, a thin film was formed on the banana skin after drying. The processed banana was placed in a self-made hood (Fig. S1b), and tin foil was pasted around the inside of the hood to enhance light reflection and reduce light transmission loss. LED tube arrays were installed on the top of the hood. Banana samples were randomly selected from each group to determine their physical and chemical quality every 24 h. The preservation effect of bananas with different types of coating treatments were explored."
6,Characterization of ATB photocatalyst and ATB/PVA film,"2.5 Characterization of ATB photocatalyst and ATB/PVA film The crystal structure of ATB photocatalyst and ATB/PVA film was characterized by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Netherlands, PANalyticl, X'Pert3 Powder), and data was analyzed by Jade 6.0 software. The chemical composition of the ATB photocatalyst and the ATB/PVA film was detected by a fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR, Germany, BRUKER, VERTEX 70). The microstructure of ATB photocatalyst and ATB/PVA film was observed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Germany, Carl Zeiss, Merlin Compact) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Japan, JEM-2100F). The content of Ag, Bi, Ti element in banana peel and pulp was measured by the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, England, PerkinElmer Optima 8300)."
7,Physical properties of ATB/PVA film,"2.6 Physical properties of ATB/PVA film 2.6.1 Thickness A thickness gauge (China, Labthink, C640) was used to measure the thickness of samples. The thickness was used for the calculation of opacity. 2.6.2 Mechanical performance The tensile strength (TS) and elongation at break (EAB) of films was determined by a tensile testing machine (Dongguan Haida, HD-609B-S) with a stretching rate of 50 mm/min. 2.6.3 Opacity The absorbance of films was measured by UV–vis spectrophotometer (Shanghai, Jing Hua, UV2300).

The unit is m3/m2·d·0.1 MPa. 2.6.6 Water vapor permeability The water vapor permeability (WVP) of film was determined according to ASTM E96 (2016) with slight modifications. 3 g anhydrous CaCl2 was added in a weighing bottle (Φ2.5), sealed the bottle with thin film and placed it in a drying kettle. The saturated NaCl solution was used to maintain the constant humidity (75%RH) of kettle. The initial weight of the bottle was determined, and the final mass was recorded one week later. The WVP was calculated according to formula (2). (2) WVP = m 0 - m t t × s d × Δ ρ where m0 is the initial weight, g; mt is the final mass, g; s is the effective area of the film, m2; d is the film thickness, μm; Δρ is the water vapor pressure difference on both sides of the film, Pa."

(3) W e i g h t l o s s ( % ) = ( m 0 - m t ) m 0 × 100 % where m0 is the initial mass of the sample, mt is the mass of the sample stored for t days, the unit is g. 2.7.3 Color L*, a* and b* of banana pericarp were determined by a handheld chromophore meter (Konica Minolta, CR-410, Japan) and corrected by standard whiteboard. 2.7.4 Firmness The hardness (N) of banana flesh was analyzed by a texture analyzer (Shimazu, EZ Test, Japan). The compression speed is 0.5 mm/s, and the compression distance is 5 mm. 2.7.5 Reducing sugar The content of reducing sugar in pulp was determined by the DNS method. The pulp was homogenized with distilled water at a ratio of 1:5. 1 mL of centrifugal supernatant and 1.5 mL of DNS reagent were heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min to develop color. The absorbance was measured at 540 nm wavelength, and distilled water was used as blank control. The reducing sugar content was calculated by the standard curve of glucose, and the results were expressed in mg/g. 2.7.6 Titratable acid The titratable acid content was determined by titration method (Dou, Shi, & Li, 2020). The banana pulp was homogenized and heated in a boiling water bath for 30 min. After cooling, 1 mL of filtrate, 5 mL of water and 3 drops of 1% phenolphthalein indicator was mixed and titrate with 0.01 mol/L sodium hydroxide to a reddish color. The results were expressed as mass fraction (%). 2.7.7 Total phenol The content of total phenol in pulp was determined according to the method of Maduwanthi et al. (2021).

9,Results and discussions,
10,Characterization of ATB photocatalyst and ATB/PVA composite film,"3.1 Characterization of ATB photocatalyst and ATB/PVA composite film 3.1.1 XRD and FT-IR As shown in Fig. 1 a, the characteristic crystal face peaks of (1 1 0), (1 1 1), (200), (220), (311), (222) of Ag2O appeared at 2θ = 26.76°, 33.01°, 38.31°, 55.34°, 65.89° and 69.22°, which indicated the successful synthesis of Ag2O (JCPDF#41-1104). According to Fig. 1b, the characteristic peaks at 2θ = 28.24°, 32.78°, 47.08°, 55.8° and 58.5° corresponded to (131), (002), (202), (331) and (262) crystal facets of the orthorhombic phase Bi2WO6, respectively (JCPDF#39-0256). The characteristic diffraction peak at 2θ = 25.18° corresponded to the (101) crystal facets of anatase phase TiO2 (JCPDS#21-1276). The (111) and (200) crystal facet peaks of Ag2O coincided with the (131) and (004) crystal plane diffraction peaks of Bi2WO6 and TiO2 (Haghighi, Haghighi, & Shabani, 2021). XRD confirmed that Ag2O, TiO2 and Bi2WO6 were successfully combined. It could be seen from Fig. 1c that all the film samples had a broad and strong diffraction peak at 2θ = 19°, which is attributed to the characteristic peak of the (101) crystal plane of PVA. This is the semi-crystalline region formed by hydrogen bonding between PVA molecular chains (Fahmy, Abou-Saied, & Helaly, 2021). With the increase of ATB amount, the characteristic peaks at 2θ = 25.2°, 28.2°, 32.7°, 47.0°, 55.7°, 58.3° increased gradually, which corresponded to (101) crystal facets of anatase TiO2 and the (131), (002), (202), (331) and (262) crystal facets of orthogonal phase Bi2WO6 (JCPDF#39-0256, JCPDS#21-1276). This demonstrated that ATB and PVA were successfully combined. While no obvious characteristic peaks of Ag2O could be found, which may be due to the less doping amount. With the addition of ATB, the crystallization peak intensity of PVA decreased, indicated that the crystallinity of the composite film decreased. This is because ATB crystals were embedded in the PVA molecular chain structure and acted as a physical barrier for the accumulation of PVA chains in the film formation process, thus impeding the crystallization (Ahmed, Niazi, & Jahan, 2020). As shown in Fig. 1d that the FT-IR spectra of the composite films with different ATB content had similar spectral line patterns. The characteristic peak at 840 cm−1 corresponded to the stretching vibration mode of HC−H bond. The significant absorption peak at 1085 cm−1 was ascribed to the stretching vibration of the −CC− bond in the PVA skeleton (Sarwar, Niazi, & Jahan, 2018). The peak at 1141 cm−1 was attributed to the antisymmetric stretching vibration of CC−O bond, while the peak at 1423 cm−1 was caused by the bending vibration of the CH bond. The weak absorption peak observed at 1708 cm−1 might be attributed to the stretching symmetric vibration of CO bond in the residual acetyl group in PVA (Khairy, Mohamed, & Reda, 2019). The characteristic peaks near 2849 cm−1 and 2910 cm−1 were mainly due to the symmetric and antisymmetric stretching vibrations of the alkyl CH bond (Kochkina & Butikova, 2019). The peak near 3250 cm−1 came from the stretching vibration of free OH on the main chain of PVA (Chen, Xiong, & Xiong, 2018). With the increase of ATB doping amount, the shape of characteristic peaks did not change significantly, indicated that ATB doping did not change the molecular structure of PVA. However, all peak positions had shifted to a certain extent, indicated that there was an interfacial interaction between ATB and PVA. With the increasing of ATB addition, the characteristic peak intensity at 3250 cm−1 was found to be significantly reduced, indicated that the number of free hydroxyl groups decreased. Therefore, it was inferred that ATB was anchored in the PVA gel network through the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. 3.1.2 Microscopic morphology of ATB and ATB/PVA film The SEM images of different photocatalysts was showed in Fig. 2 a–2d. Among them, TiO2 was spherical or irregular polygonal particles with a size between 20 and 50 nm (Fig. 2a). Ag2O appeared as spherical particles with a size of about 50–150 nm (Fig. 2b). While Bi2WO6 was a porous microsphere formed by self-assembled two-dimensional nanosheets crossed in three-dimensional directions, with a size of about 2–4 μm (Fig. 2c). TiO2 and Ag2O were deposited on Bi2WO6 nanosheets to form ATB composite microspheres with rough surface (Fig. 2d). Compared with TB, ATB microspheres had less pores but the size remained the same. Lattice fringes of d = 0.315 nm, 0.351 nm and 0.236 nm were obtained by TEM observation (Fig. 2e), which were derived from the characteristic atomic arrangement of (131), (101), and (200) crystal facets of Bi2WO6, TiO2 and Ag2O (JCPDS#21-1272, JCPDS#39-0256, JCPDS#41-1104) respectively. According to EDX (Fig. 2f), ATB contained five elements: O, Ti, W, Bi and Ag, among which O, Ti and Bi were the main elements and had a relatively high mass and atomic ratio. However, due to a small amount of doping, the mass and atomic ratio of Ag element were1.31% and 0.43%, respectively. According to element mapping (Fig. 2g−2l), the distribution of Bi and W element was relatively concentrated and showed regional distribution, which indicated the existence of Bi2WO6 nanosheets. However, Ti, O and Ag elements was widely distributed in a circular or dot pattern, and the distribution area was mainly located on the surface or edge of Bi2WO6 nanosheets, which indicated that Ti, O and Ag elements were mainly deposited on the surface or edge of Bi2WO6 nanosheets by forming similar spherical particles. The existence of ATB heterojunction was confirmed by SEM and TEM. As could be seen from Fig. 2m and Fig. 2n, the surface of PVA film was smooth and flat without any cracks and bubbles, while the cross-section structure was compact, and obvious cracks generated by liquid nitrogen quenching could be observed. When ATB was doped, bright ATB microspheres could be observed on the surface of the PVA film (Fig. 2o). The particles were randomly distributed and well dispersed. The uniformly distributed ATB microspheres were also found at the cross section (Fig. 2p), and the microsphere structure was complete, indicated that the doping process did not change the microscopic morphology of ATB. SEM analysis showed that some ATB microspheres were exposed on the surface of the PVA film, while some were embedded in the interior of film. The exposed ATB particles increased the contact area with ethylene, which promoted the photocatalytic reaction, while the embedded may affect the physical properties of the film."
11,Physical properties of ATB/PVA film,"3.2 Physical properties of ATB/PVA film Packaging materials with appropriate mechanical strength could protect food from external mechanical damage (Li, Ye, & Jiang, 2017). The mechanical properties of the films were analyzed by measuring the tensile strength (TS) and elongation at break (EAB). It could be seen from Fig. 3 a that PVA had the smallest TS and the largest EAB, which were 18.54 MPa and 148.5%, respectively. With the addition of ATB, the TS of composite film increased and the EAB decreased gradually. When the addition amount was 7%, the TS reached the maximum value of 30.73 MPa, and the EAB reduced to the minimum at only 50.6%, which indicated that the addition of ATB reduced the flexibility and improved strain resistance of PVA film. This was because ATB particles formed hydrogen bonds or covalent bonds with PVA molecular chains to replace the inter-chain hydrogen bonds originally formed, which reduced the mobility and increased rigidity of molecular chains (Oleyaei, Almasi, & Ghanbarzadeh, 2016). As could be seen from the Fig. 3b, the OP and WVP of PVA film were 0.67 cm3/(m2·d·0.1 MPa) and 40.08 g/(m2·d·Pa), respectively. With the increase of ATB content, the OP and WVP gradually decreased. When the addition amount was 7%, the OP and WVP reached the minimum of 0.39 cm3/(m2·d·0.1 MPa) and 36.77 g/(m2·d·Pa), respectively, which indicated that the addition of ATB improved the oxygen and moisture resistance of the composite film. This is because the ATB particles formed a tortuous path inside the polymer molecules, which prolonged the transmission and diffusion distance, thereby hindering the permeation of oxygen and water molecules. On the other hand, the hydrogen bonding between the ATB particles and the PVA molecular chain made film denser, the free void volume for water and oxygen penetration was reduced, thus improving the barrier properties. (Woo, Kim, & Kim, 2020). The thermal stability of the sample was investigated by TG-DSC. According to Fig. 3c, the pyrolysis process of ATB/PVA composite film was mainly divided into three stages. The first stage was mainly the vaporization and decomposition of moisture and volatile functional groups in the sample (40–150 °C). The second stage was the melting degradation of the PVA molecular chain, which was mainly manifested by the −CC− main chain decomposition (200–300 °C) with a huge weight loss. The third stage was the complete carbonization and decomposition of PVA molecules at temperatures greater than 300 °C (Bialik-Wąs, Pluta, & Malina, 2021). Due to the excellent high temperature resistance of nanomaterials, the final mass residues gradually increased with the increase of ATB amount, which were 5.48%, 5.89%, 6.87%, 11.66%, 11.82%, 13.01%, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3d, two obvious endothermic peaks could be observed. The first peak corresponded to the glass transition process of the film, and its peak temperature was the glass transition temperature (Tg). Tg referred to the phase transition temperature when the polymer chain moving in the amorphous region changes from the glass state to the rubber state(Niazi, Jahan, & Ahmed, 2020). The second peak corresponded to the melting temperature (Tm) of the PVA film. Generally, higher Tg and Tm values represented better thermodynamic stability. With the increase of ATB doping amount, the Tg increased from 109.63 °C to 124.48 °C, while the Tm increased from 287.40 °C to 296.36 °C. TG-DSC showed that the doping of ATB improved the thermal stability of the film. This was mainly attributed to the steric hindrance formed by ATB crystal particles inside the polymer molecules, which restricted the molecular migration. The crystal particles and the polymer formed compact and rigid copolymer, which improved the thermal stability of the composite (Chen, Xiong, & Xiong, 2018). The opacity was used to evaluate the light transmittance of films. The higher opacity meant the worse light transmittance. It could be seen from Fig. 3e that ATB inorganic filler had a great influence on the opacity of film. PVA film had a very low opacity value of only 0.34. With the addition of ATB, the opacity increased sharply, indicated that the film transparency decreased. The opacity of 7%ATB/PVA was 9.41. The reduced light transmittance may be due to the lightproof of ATB, which hindered the light transmission and scattering when it dispersed in the PVA matrix, thus the opacity increased (Wang, Wang, & Ye, 2019)."
12,Application of ATB/PVA film in banana preservation,"3.3 Application of ATB/PVA film in banana preservation It could be seen from Fig. 4 that all bananas had the same degree of maturity at the initial stage, the color was cyan with a little yellow, and there was no obvious mechanical damage in appearance. The uncoated bananas completely changed from cyan to yellow on the third day, while the coated was on the fourth day. On the fifth day, all the bananas began to develop black spots on the epidermis except those treated with ATB/PVA coating. This is due to the enzymatic browning of phenolic compounds resulting in the deposition of quinones in the epidermis (Huang, Ge, & Limwachiranon, 2017; Soradech, Nunthanid, & Limmatvapirat, 2017). Seven days later, the epidermis of the blank samples was severely oxidized, a large black area had been formed, and the fruits lost edible value. However, the black area of bananas with PVA coating was greatly reduced, and only a small black area could be observed in ATB/PVA coating samples, which proved that ATB/PVA coating could effectively degrade ethylene and prevent the gas exchange between inside and outside the film, thus inhibiting the oxidation of phenolic compounds. As could be seen in Fig. 5 a, with the extension of storage time, the concentration of ethylene showed an upward trend. The spike in ethylene concentration on the second day was because that at the initial stage of storage, the oxygen residue in the closed container accelerated respiration rate of the bananas, which produced a large amount of ethylene. Later, because of the depletion of oxygen in the container, the increased CO2 inhibited the respiration of the bananas, thus the ethylene concentration increased slowly. After 8 days, the order of ethylene concentration was as followed: control (27.71 μL/L)>PVA (27.34 μL/L)>TiO2/PVA (27.33 μL/L)>Bi2WO6/PVA (25.87 μL/L)>TB/PVA (23.88 μL/L) > ATB/PVA (22.95 μL/L). Compared with the blank group, the ethylene concentration was reduced by 17.17% in the reactor with ATB/PVA film, which indicated that ATB/PVA film had photocatalytic degradation effect of ethylene produced by postharvest bananas. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of ATB was mainly attributed to the formation of ternary heterojunctions, which enhanced the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers and promoted the photocatalytic reaction. The color change of banana epidermis is evaluated according to L*, a* and b*. The L* represents brightness, positive means white, negative means black. a* represents the degree of red and green, positive is red, negative is green. And b* is the degree of yellow and blue, positive tends to be yellow, negative tends to be blue (Cho, Lee, & Park, 2016). According to Fig. 5b, the skin brightness of all bananas showed a downward trend with the extension of storage time. After 7 days, the coating bananas had higher L* value when compared with the blank samples, and the ATB/PVA coating bananas had highest L* value of 33.48. According to Fig. 5c, the initial a* value of fresh bananas is –2.46, but as the respiration progressed, the chlorophyll in the epidermis was gradually enzymatically hydrolyzed, and the lutein and carotenoids which were yellow in the senses, increased continuously, resulting the rising of a* value. The ATB/PVA coating samples had the lowest a* value of 3.17 on the 7th day, indicated that the ATB/PVA coating treatment could effectively inhibit the yellowing of bananas. As shown in Fig. 5d, the change of b* value presented a trend of first increasing and then decreasing, which was in accordance with the process of banana changing from cyan to yellow and then gradually turning to black. After 7 days, the blank group had the lowest b* value of 14.55, and the ATB/PVA coating bananas had the highest b* value of 37.47, indicated that the ATB/PVA coating prevented the oxidation and blackening of the banana skin. In conclusion, ATB/PVA coating can significantly delay banana aging and improve the skin color, this is because the presence of coating film hindered the gas exchange and delayed chlorophyll degradation. In addition, the elimination of ethylene also reduced the respiration, thus impeding the formation of aging black spots. The results were basically consistent with Fig. 4. The weight loss of fresh fruits mainly comes from the loss of water and carbon atoms caused by transpiration and respiration of fruit. Appropriate coating treatment can be an effective physical barrier for hindering the evaporation and starch decomposition (Cosme, Silva, & Medeiros, 2017). As shown in Fig. 5e, the weight loss of all bananas showed an upward trend during storage, and the weight loss of blank samples was as high as 20.46% after 7 days. When compared with blank group, the weight loss of PVA coating bananas was significantly reduced (p < 0.05), which was about 11.50%, while the weight loss of TiO2/PVA, Bi2WO6/PVA, and TB/PVA coating bananas were 12.32%, 11.22% and 11.03%, respectively. The ATB/PVA coating bananas had the lowest weight loss, which was only 9.60%. This is mainly because the PVA semi-permeable membrane formed by the coating treatment on the banana epidermis provided a physical barrier and reduced the water loss on the surface of the peel. In addition, ATB had the enhanced photocatalytic degradation effect of ethylene, thus effectively reducing the degradation loss of carbohydrate (Chi, Song, & Luo, 2019). Hardness is an important parameter reflecting banana ripening stage and quality. During the post-ripening process of banana, ethylene, as a signal molecule, enhanced the activities of pectinase and polygalacturonase, which leaded to the degradation of pectin substances and the rupture of cell wall , thus reducing the hardness of fruit flesh. (Mditshwa, Magwaza, & Tesfay, 2017). As shown in Fig. 5f, the hardness of all samples continued to decrease during the storage process, and the decrease rate of blank samples was the largest, which decreased to 0.31 N after 7 days. But the hardness of coating samples decreased slowly (p < 0.05). Seven days later, the hardness of bananas with PVA, TiO2/PVA, Bi2WO6/PVA, TB/PVA and ATB/PVA coating were 0.51, 0.58, 0.66, 0.64 and 0.68 N, respectively, which indicated that ATB/PVA coating could maintain the hardness of banana pulp effectively. This is mainly attributed to the coating film effectively reduced the physiological activity of cells and delayed fruit ripening. On the other hand, ATB photocatalysis reduced the content of ethylene and increased the concentration of CO2, which reduced the activity of pectinase and kept higher pulp hardness. Total phenols, which mainly includes polyphenols and flavonoids, are one of the main substances in plant secondary metabolism and have strong antioxidant capacity (Li, Zhang, & Li, 2019). However, the presence of ethylene in the storage environment can increase the activity of polyphenol oxidase (PPO), which hydrolyzes phenolic substances into anthraquinone, and further oxidizes into macromolecular melanin precipitation, thus leading to the formation of brown senescence and dark spots on the banana skin (Pongprasert, Sekozawa, & Sugaya, 2011). Therefore, the influence of different treatments on banana quality can be explored by measuring the total phenol content and PPO activity. In Fig. 5g and Fig. 5h, with the increase of storage days, PPO activity showed an upward trend, while the corresponding total phenol content showed a downward trend. After 7 days, the total phenol content of the blank group decreased to 0.32 mg/g, while the ATB/PVA coating banana had the highest total phenol content of 0.48 mg/g. Compared with the blank group, the PPO activity of bananas with ATB/PVA coating was significantly decreased (p < 0.05). This indicated that ATB/PVA coating treatment could effectively inhibit PPO relative activity and increase total phenol content. The sugar in banana pulp is mainly in the form of starch. Ethylene triggers a fruit development cascade during post-ripening that promotes the decomposition of glycogen into small molecule reducing sugars (Li, Sun, & Sun, 2019). Therefore, the concentration of reducing sugar (RS) in the pulp is an important indicator reflecting the quality and taste of the fruit. As shown in Table S1, the reducing sugar concentration (RS) value in pulp gradually increased with the prolonging of storage time. The RS value of the uncoated samples reached the highest value about 110.87 mg/g on the 6th day, and then began to decrease. This is because most starch was hydrolyzed in the later storage, the reducing sugar became the main substance of respiration and been constantly consumed (Haiwu, Biao, & Haishi, 2020; Li, Limwachiranon, & Li, 2016). After 7 days, the RS of bananas treated with PVA, TiO2/PVA, Bi2WO6/PVA, TB/PVA, ATB/PVA coating were 98.02, 97.16, 93.42, 94.86 and 90.31 mg/g, respectively, the RS of coating bananas were higher than those without coating (p < 0.05), which showed that ATB/PVA coating effectively reduced amylase activity, inhibited glycogen decomposition, and delayed banana ripening. Malic acid and citric acid are the main organic acids in bananas. When respiration occurred, organic acids was continuously consumed as substrates for enzymatic respiration reactions (De León-Zapata, Pastrana-Castro, & Barbosa-Pereira, 2017). Therefore, the titratable acidity (TA) value can well reflect the ripening process of the fruit. As shown in Table S2, with the prolongation of storage time, the TA showed an overall downward trend. The TA of blank group decreased from the initial 0.288% to 0.052%, indicated that a large amount of organic acid was consumed. But the coating samples retained higher TA than control group at the end of storage (p < 0.05). The TA of bananas treated with PVA, TiO2/PVA, Bi2WO6/PVA, TB/PVA and ATB/PVA coating were 0.07%, 0.133%, 0.126%, 0.14%, and 0.143%, respectively, which proved that ATB/PVA coating could reduce the consumption of organic acids and delay the ripening of bananas. This is mainly due to the ATB/PVA coating provided a closed gas micro-environment with low ethylene and high CO2 concentration for single banana, thereby inhibiting the respiration and reducing the consumption of organic acids (Chowdhury, Teoh, & Ong, 2020). The SEM pictures of banana peel is showed in Fig S2. In Fig. S2a, the peel surface of fresh banana is slightly rough, and irregular cavities with a size of about 10 μm can be observed. These cavities are the pores of the banana epidermis, which are used to promote the gas exchange between the internal tissues and the external environment. It can be seen from Fig S2b, severe epidermal shrinkage occurred, which is caused by the loss of water by plant transpiration and respiration. In Fig. S2c, the shrinkage of the samples treated with PVA coating were significantly reduced. Compared with other samples, the epidermis surface of ATB/PVA coating bananas is relatively smooth, closely arranged cells with complete structure and full morphology can be observed (Fig. S2d), which proved that ATB/PVA coating effectively inhibits the water loss of bananas. In addition, bright spherical particles with a diameter of 3 μm on the surface of banana peel are ATB microspheres, which attached to the epidermis during the coating process."
13,Safety study,"3.4 Safety study In order to evaluate the effect of ATB/PVA coating on the safety of bananas, the contents of Ag, Bi and Ti elements in the peel and pulp of ATB/PVA coating bananas were determined by ICP-OES. As shown in Table S3, after 7 days of storage, the Bi element content in banana was lower than the instrument detection limit (0.04 mg/L), which could not be detected. The content of Ag in pulp and peel was 0.0165 mg/kg and 0.0170 mg/kg, respectively, which was lower than the regulatory limits for the migration of Ag+ in the European Union of 0.01 mg/kgfood (Hannon, Kerry, & Cruz-Romero, 2018). The content of Ti element in pulp and peel was 0.0169 mg/kg and 0.0219 mg/kg respectively, which was far lower than the maximum allowed addition level of TiO2 in food (1%wt) stipulated by FDA (Enescu, Dehelean, & Gonçalves, 2020). Therefore, ATB/PVA coating would not cause a safety problem for bananas."
14,The banana preservation mechanism of ATB/PVA film,"3.5 The banana preservation mechanism of ATB/PVA film The possible mechanism of ATB/PVA film inhibiting the ripening and maintaining nutritional quality of bananas was shown in Fig. 6 . The fresh-keeping effect mainly comes from two aspects: (i) As shown in Fig. 6a, after harvest, bananas entered the post-harvest stage, the respiratory peak appeared. As the substrate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, sugar and acid substances were constantly consumed, and a large amount of CO2 was generated at the same time. However, a selective semi-permeable membrane was formed in banana epidermis by coating treatment, which inhibited the diffusion of CO2 and O2, therefore, a partial pressure environment with low O2 and high CO2 concentration was formed inside the membrane, which effectively inhibited the respiration of bananas (Kritchenkov, Egorov, & Volkova, 2020). In addition, due to the transpiration of plants, water is constantly evaporated during storage, but the existence of semi-permeable membrane effectively hinders the mass loss and diffusion of water molecules. Therefore, the coating treatment can reduce the weight loss, increase the content of total phenol and titrated acid, inhibit the activity of amylase and PPO, and hinder glycogen decomposition and phenolic oxidation of bananas. After doping with ATB, the oxygen and water resistance of PVA film was improved, thus ATB/PVA coating bananas could maintain nutrients and better sensory quality. (ii) ATB particles exposed to the outside of the film produced photogenerated electron-hole pairs excited by LED light. The electrons and holes were captured by O2 and surface hydroxyl (or H2O) to produce •O2 − and •OH with strong oxidation ability, respectively, then mineralized and decomposed ethylene into CO2 and H2O (Lv, Li, & Huang, 2019). The specific photocatalytic process was shown in Fig. 6b. Under illumination, the electrons (e-) of TiO2, Ag2O and Bi2WO6 on the valence band (VB) were excited and transition to the conduction band (CB), left positive charge holes (h+) in the corresponding VB. Driven by potential energy, CB electrons and VB holes undergone directional migration. Therefore, electrons were enriched in the CB of Ag2O, while holes were transferred to the VB of TiO2 and Bi2WO6, and redox reactions occurred in the corresponding VB and CB. The Ag+ on the Ag2O surface was transformed into Ag0 due to photoreduction. Since Ag0 had a smaller work function than Ag2O, electrons tend to be injected into the Ag0 surface, which further promoted the separation and transfer of photogenerated electron-hole pairs (Sharma, Liu, & Ma, 2020). The photocatalytic process could degrade the ethylene and furthermore promoted the consumption of O2, thereby inhibiting the respiration and delaying the ripening of bananas."
15,Conclusion,"In this study, the ATB heterojunction photocatalyst was synthesized by hydrothermal and surface deposition method, and ATB/PVA composite films were constructed by the casting method. The characterization results of ATB photocatalyst and ATB/PVA film showed that Ag2O and TiO2 were deposited on the surface of Bi2WO6 nanosheets to form a heterostructure, and the composite process did not change the crystal phase composition of each other. ATB particles were anchored in the PVA gel network by forming interchain hydrogen bonds with PVA molecules, which reduced the crystallinity of PVA. The process of internal doping makes some ATB microspheres exposed on the surface of the film, which fully contacted with ethylene, thus participating in the photocatalytic reaction, while the others were embedded inside the film, which enhanced the mechanical strength, thermal stability, oxygen and water resistance of the film, but reduced the opacity. The results of ATB/PVA banana preservation experiment showed that ATB/PVA film had a certain degradation effect on the ethylene released by storage banana under the irradiation of LED light, and the ethylene concentration was reduced by 17.17%. When compared with the blank group, ATB/PVA coating could effectively reduce the weight loss, glucose content and PPO activity, inhibit the water loss of the peel, improve the content of titratable acid and total phenol and delay the aging of bananas. Safety studies have shown that the content of Ag, Bi, and Ti elements migrated from ATB/PVA film to banana peel and pulp were within a safe concentration. Thus, ATB/PVA film could be used as a safe and effective fruit package."
