0,Introduction,"Room temperature ILs have gained significant attention due to their use in industry and research fields as an alternative to organic solvents [1–10] because of their excellent chemical and physical properties. These have many desirable properties like low vapor pressure, high thermal as well as electrochemical stability, less flammability and high conductivity which make them the possible alternate solvents for several applications [11–13] in chemical and industrial processes. A subset of ILs, protic ionic liquid (PILs), has been studied extensively due to their excellent thermophysical and thermodynamic properties [14–27]. However, due to the high production cost and purification limits, ILs are used with the combination of molecular solvents [28–38] in many applications. The physicochemical properties of ILs undergo significant change in the presence of molecular solvents [30,31]. Addition of molecular solvents disturbs the structure and dynamics of ILs [39,40]. Thus, understanding the interactions between molecular solvents and ILs is important. Moreover, the molecular structure and dynamics of these mixtures have not been understood at the microscopic level. N, N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) is an aprotic organic solvent with high polarity. It can dissolve both organic and inorganic solvents due to its relatively high dielectric constant and large dipole moment; therefore, this has been used in various applications [41–43]. Recently, Biswas et al. studied the aqueous solutions of DMF at various mole fractions and reported the effects of temperature on physical properties of the solution computationally [44]. The authors suggested that the addition of DMF to water promotes the water-DMF hydrogen bond, and decreases the hydrogen bonding between water molecules. DMF has strong electron-pair donating and accepting ability, and the hydrogen bond acceptor atom (oxygen) of DMF can enable strong solvation in the presence of other appropriate functional groups. Protic ILs contain a hydrogen bond network between cations and anions. One can mix this family of ionic liquids with DMF to enhance the desired and controlled hydrogen bond network, and it may be possible to get the required properties. Mixtures of solvents with ILs are critical in many fields such as extraction processes, petrochemistry, biochemistry, and pharmaceutical industries. Therefore, several experimental [38,45–47] studies have been reported on mixtures of DMF with ILs. For example, Keshapolla et al. measured the molar volume and isentropic compressibility of mixtures of DMF with two ionic liquids, benzyldimethylammonium hexanoate, and benzyldimethyl ammonium propionate, and concluded that ion-ion interactions are more in DMF- benzyldimethyl ammonium propionate mixture [38]. Attri et al. [45] measured the densities, excess molar volume and isentropic compressibilities of three ammonium based ILs with DMF. They showed that the alkyl chain length on cation has a little effect, but it has an important contribution towards overall molecular interactions. Among triethylammonium acetate (TEAA) and diethylammonium acetate (DEAA), later shows strong interaction with DMF. Sahu et al. [32] reported the importance of ion-dipole and hydrogen bonding interactions for the imidazolium-based ILs by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), and time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy experiments. Although there are some more experimental studies [38,45–47] on DMF mixtures with ILs, to our knowledge, few computational studies are available on these mixtures. Vahid and Maginn studied the thermodynamic properties of organic molecules in ionic liquids by Monte Carlo simulations [48]; the enthalpy of mixing is positive for the alcohols due to the existing strong hydrogen bonds in alcohols, but for DMF and dimethyl sulfoxide, enthalpy of mixing is negative. The investigation of structure and dynamics of mixtures of ionic liquids with organic liquids is required to obtain the microscopic insights of these mixtures. Obtaining structural and dynamical properties from molecular dynamics are considered as a good measure for understanding the interactions between solvents in mixtures. To date, many RTILs in aqueous solutions have attracted researchers due to the self-organization of RTILs in water [49–52]. The number of computational studies on the mixtures of ILs with non-aqueous solvents is less [53,54]. To contribute towards this gap, we report here the structural and dynamical aspects of the mixtures of DMF with DEAA and TEAA, to characterize the ion-dipole, dipole-dipole interactions and the behavior of the mixtures at various concentrations."
1,Computational methodology,"Classical molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to study the structure and dynamics of various mole fractions (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 X IL) of IL-DMF mixtures. For each mole fraction, the total number of molecule and ion-pairs was fixed to 500 by taking the proper number of DMF and ions. The initial configurations were generated with PACKMOL [55] software. All the simulations of these mixtures were carried out with GROMACS 5.0.4 [56] simulation package. Bonding interactions were adopted from the OPLS-AA force field [57], and the non-bonding interaction parameters for cations of ILs were taken from Chang et al. [58] work. Based on the calculations, Zhang et al. [59] showed that better results for dynamics could be obtained by scaling charges to 0.8 on individual ions of ILs. A scaling factor of 0.78 to partial charges of ammonium-based ILs was proved to be a better choice to reproduce the general trends in experimental results [60–62]. As the systems reported here are also ammonium-based ILs, we scaled the charges to 0.78 on the ions of ILs. Each system was minimized with the steepest descent method. LINCS algorithm [63] was employed to constrain the length of all the covalent bonds possessing hydrogen atoms. Then, 1 ns simulation was performed at 500 K to get the proper mixing of ions and DMF. The mixture was cooled down by using the annealing process from 500 K to 298 K. In the annealing process, the temperature was decreased with an interval of 50 K for every 200 ps, and after reaching 300 K, the temperature was decreased to 298 K for remaining simulation time. Then, the systems were equilibrated within the isothermal-isobaric ensemble condition at 1 atm for 30 ns. The trajectory of the last 28 ns was used to calculate the density. The average converged cell volume, calculated from the last 28 ns of NpT simulations, was used for subsequent simulations in NVT and NVE simulations. The systems were then simulated with constant volume-temperature (NVT) ensemble for 20 ns followed by a production run of 200 ns in the microcanonical ensemble. The trajectories were saved at every 1 ps time step. Periodic boundary conditions were applied along x, y and z directions. The cutoff distance was 1.2 nm for non-bonded interactions, and a time step of 1 fs was used for the simulations. We used particle mesh Ewald method [64] to treat the long-range electrostatic interactions. Structural and dynamical properties were calculated from the saved trajectories of the production run. Chemical structures of cation and anion of IL and DMF are shown in Fig. 1 , along with a snapshot of the simulation box at one of the mole fractions. Optimized XYZ coordinates for cation, anion, and DMF are provided in supporting information. Nonbonding force field parameters for cations, anions, and DMF molecules are presented in Tables S1, S2, and S3, respectively."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Pure ionic liquids,"3.1 Pure ionic liquids To shed light on the structure of pure ionic liquids (DEAA and TEAA), we calculated the radial distribution functions (RDFs) between the ionic center of mass (COM) pairs. The COM-COM RDFs of cation-anion, cation ̶cation, and anion ̶anion pairs, as well as the corresponding number integrals, are shown in Fig. 2 . Well-defined oscillations can be observed in these RDFs, and these show the existence of long-range interactions between ions. When compared to the positions of first peaks of cation-cation and anion ̶anion RDFs, cation ̶anion RDF shows a sharp and strong peak at lower distances, 0.51 and 0.58 nm for DEAA and TEAA, respectively. This is the evidence for highly favored cation ̶anion attraction due to hydrogen bonding combined strong electrostatic interactions. Cation ̶cation and anion-anion RDFs have lower first peak heights than cation ̶anion RDFs. First minima of cation-cation and anion-anion RDFs are found at larger distances than cation-anion. Due to the strong electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions between ions of IL, ions are always surrounded by counter ions forming an ion cage structure. The out of phase oscillations of RDFs of cation-cation and anion-anion as compared to that of cation ̶anion specify the formation of local charge ordering in neat ILs; each ion in first solvation shell is surrounded by counterions [58,65–73]. This behavior of ILs is consistent with the previous studies [58,73]. The first peak of cation ̶cation RDF is less broader than anion ̶anion RDF which may be caused by the orientational correlation of anions. The first peaks of cation ̶cation RDFs have lower heights than anion ̶anion RDFs. When we compare DEAA and TEAA, the first peaks of RDFs of TEAA are moved towards larger distances. From the cation-anion RDFs, it is observed that TEAA shows a “double peak” within 0.50 nm which is absent in DEAA. This can be due to the presence of van der Waals interactions between cation and anion with the increase in the number of alkyl groups in cation. RDFs between alkyl carbons of cations and methyl carbon of acetate are shown in Fig. S1. In pure ILs, alkyl chains of TEAA show higher association with methyl carbon of acetate. DEAA mixture shows a shoulder at 0.63 nm, however, TEAA mixture shows a “double peak” between 0.5 and 0.63 nm. The anion can approach the cation in two different directions in TEAA; from the sides of the NH bond and alkyl chains. First peaks of cation-cation and anion-anion RDFs of TEAA are found at larger distances than DEAA due to the increase in the size of the solvation shell with the addition of alkyl groups in the cation. We also see that the first peaks of cation-cation and anion-anion RDFs of TEAA have higher heights than DEAA because of an increase in van der Waals interaction. The spatial correlation between cations increases when one more alkyl chain is added to cation moity, which is consistent with the previous studies [58,74–79]. Chang et al. studied the structural properties of trialkylammonium ILs and showed that cation-anion COM RDFs exhibit long-range ordering than cation-cation and anion-anion RDFs [58]. In our study, cation-anion and anion-anion show long-range correlations as compared to cation-cation RDFs. Zhang et al. have investigated the alkyl chain length effect on the structure of imidazolium ILs and found that there was a decrease in the height of the first peak in the cation-anion RDFs with decrease in alkyl chain length [74]. Margulis showed that when larger alkyl chain length was present on cations, anions were more structured around cation [75]. This observation is opposite to our studies where anions are less structured with the increase of alkyl chain length on cation. However, our results are consistent with that of Padua and co-workers who calculated the COM RDFs between cation and anion and reported a decrease in peak height with the increase in alkyl chain length [77]. Atom-atom RDFs were also calculated between the N, HN (bonded to N) and H (bonded to methylene carbon) atoms of the cation with the O and H (attached to carbon) atoms of the anion. These RDFs are presented in Fig. 3 . The most important peak is observed between acidic hydrogen of cation and oxygen of anion at 0.18 nm for both the ILs. The addition of alkyl group on cation does not alter the hydrogen bonding in these ionic liquids in the first solvation shell. The first peak of this RDF has higher correlations in TEAA than DEAA. This type of increase in correlations with the addition of alkyl groups was previously observed [60–62,80]. The first peak of RDF between O of anion and methylene H indicates weak interaction. Thus, the hydrogen bond between acidic H of cation and O of anion within 0.18 nm suggests that strong hydrogen bond exists between cation and anion. Another observation in OH RDFs is the position second minor peak for DEAA, which is absent in TEAA. Among the NO RDFs, the height of the first peak is more in DEAA than in TEAA. The decrease in electrostatic interaction between ions with the addition of an alkyl group on cation lowers the association of counter ions. Possibility of forming cation-anion cages is high where we have observed the out of phase behavior from COM RDFs. RDF between N of cation and H of acetate anion shows a broad peak; the same is true for methylene H of cation and O of acetate, which indicates the weak interaction."
4,Mixtures of DMF with DEAA and TEAA ILs,"3.2 Mixtures of DMF with DEAA and TEAA ILs Densities of all the mixtures were calculated and compared with the experimental values. (Fig. 4 ) All the calculated densities were underestimated for DEAA+DMF mixtures and overestimated for mixtures of TEAA with DMF; however, the maximum error percentage is less than 2. At higher mole fractions of IL, the deviation of density from the experiment is less. The change in density is much smaller at IL rich region. Experimental and calculated densities showed a nonlinear increase with the increase in mole fraction of ILs. The snapshots of pure and mixtures are shown in Figs. S2 and S3, respectively. The snapshot of hydrogen bonding environment between cation and anion are shown in Fig. S4. A connected network of apolar domains, composed of alkyl chains of the cations, is observed in neat ILs. The anions, which can be considered as polar domains, are discrete. This type of structural heterogeneity is different from the imidazolium-based ILs where the polar network is connected, and apolar network forms isolated islands in IL matrix [77,81–83]. Wang et al. studied the structural organization of IL/water mixtures with tetraalkylphosphonium based ILs, and their study also showed that the polar network of IL is discrete and apolar network is connected in neat ILs [84]. Although the reported results are similar to their work, but not identical. In their studies, the anions are isolated, but in our study, the anions become part of small aggregates [84]. When the concentration of DMF increases in the mixtures, the structural transition of DMF molecules from monomers to dimers/trimer (0.8 and 0.6 X IL), clusters (0.4 X IL) and large aggregates (0.2 X IL) are observed for both the ILs; DMF molecules form a percolating network in the matrix of IL. COM RDFs of all possible relevant pairs were calculated for four mole fractions of ILs and are shown in Fig. 5 (Cation–anion, DMF–DMF, cation–DMF and anion–DMF) and S5 (Cation–cation and anion–anion). From Fig. 5a, the cation-anion RDF shows a sharp peak at 0.41 nm with the first minimum at 0.54 nm for DEAA. Moreover, TEAA also shows a sharp peak at 0.41 nm and the first minimum at 0.6 nm. Like pure IL (Fig. 2), mixtures also show a “double peak” for TEAA. The increase in the position of first minima for DEAA as compared to TEAA is due to the increase in the size of the first solvation shell. The well-defined oscillations are observed even at high concentrations of DMF, which is related to long-range spatial correlations between ions (The second and third peaks also can be observed at longer distances.). The association of cation and anion decreases with the increase in mole fraction of IL. We also observe that the distribution of neighbor counter ions around ions of IL changes significantly with the mole fraction of IL. The decrease in peak heights shows that DMF molecules play a significant role in changing the structure of IL. From DEAA to TEAA, the change in structure can be seen from Fig. 5a. For a similar concentration of IL, DEAA shows stronger association of cation and anion. DMF has a similar effect on both cation-cation (Fig. S5a) and anion–anion (Fig. S5b) pairs. The cation–cation RDFs are shown in Fig. S5a exhibit broad peaks at 0.50 and 0.61 nm for DEAA and TEAA, respectively. First minima were found at 0.73, 0.74, 0.75 and 0.75 nm for 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 mole fractions of DEAA, respectively. Similarly, TEAA shows first minima at 0.89, 0.90, 0.91, 0.91 nm for 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 mole fractions of IL, respectively. The second and third peaks of RDFs are well defined, but the peak heights are small when compared to the first peak for DEAA. Cation-cation interactions show long-range correlations in DEAA. However, they are absent in TEAA. The correlations between cations slightly decrease at higher IL concentration in both the ILs. Thus, the distribution of cation around themselves does not change with the increase in the concentration of IL. When we compare DEAA and TEAA for same mole fraction of IL, cation–cation RDF peak heights are more in TEAA. It indicates that cation-cation association is stronger in TEAA. Anion–anion RDFs are presented in Fig. S5b. From this figure, all the RDFs show a broad peak at 0.68 nm and the first minimum at 1.03 nm for DEAA. TEAA shows peaks at 0.78 nm and the first minimum at 1.05 nm for cation–cation RDFs. The trend in peak heights is similar to cation–cation RDFs. Both cation–cation and anion–anion RDFs for TEAA were found at larger distances. The second peak in these RDFs is well defined and is more pronounced than cation–cation RDFs. From all these three types (Figs. 5a, S5a, S5b) of RDFs, it is understood that with the increase in mole fraction of IL, the correlation between ions of the ionic liquid decreases due to increase in associations between DMF and ions. To confirm this, we calculated the COM RDFs of DMF–DMF, cation–DMF and anion–DMF. The results are presented in Fig. 5b, c, and d. As expected, the correlation between cation–DMF, anion–DMF, and DMF–DMF increases with IL concentration. The first peak and first minimum in cation–DMF RDFs are found at 0.62 and 0.78 nm, respectively. In the case of DEAA, a shoulder is found for the cation–DMF RDFs and is not found for TEAA. The possibility of forming hydrogen bonds in DEAA is more as compared to TEAA due to the presence of two acidic hydrogen atoms. The first peak and minimum of anion–DMF RDF are found at 0.52 and 0.71 nm, respectively. To summarize, the correlation between ions of IL and DMF increases with the increase in mole fraction of IL. Addition of DMF molecules promotes the association between ions of IL. This behavior is opposite to water effect on one of the ammonium-based IL, where cation has a similar structure with the current study [58]. We further calculated the coordination numbers to see the association of ions and molecules with the variation of IL concentration. Coordination numbers are shown in Fig. 6 as a function of mole fraction of IL. The values of these numbers, along with the corresponding first minimum, are presented in Table S4. The coordination numbers of cation-anion suggest that they are more solvated by their counterions at higher concentrations of IL. The increase in coordination number of cation-anion in the first solvation shell can be related to the increase in the number of counterions in surroundings with the concentration of IL. A sharp increase in coordination numbers of cation-anion is observed in IL rich region. The decrease in coordination number is seen for cation–DMF, anion–DMF, and DMF–DMF pairs with the increase in IL concentration. These results show that ions are more solvated by their counter ions at higher X IL. Each cation or anion roughly surrounded by 3 to 4 counter ions. DMF–DMF coordination numbers are higher than cation–DMF and anion–DMF, which is due to the larger size of the first solvation shell. Liu et al. have calculated the RDFs of cation-cation and cation-anion of imidazolium ILs in aqueous solution and they found that the correlation between cation and anion is strong which is due to the strong spatial correlation between opposite ions even if a large amount of water is present [85]; our studies also show the similar behavior. Chang et al. studied the structure and dynamics of aqueous mixtures of ammonium-based ILs. From their RDFs, it was shown that association of cation and anion decreased with the addition of IL, which is also similar to our observations [58]. We have calculated the spatial distribution of anion around cation and present in Figs. S6 and S7. These figures suggest that anions distribution around cation in DEAA and TEAA mixtures with DMF is different. Acetate anion shows two similar distributions around two acidic hydrogen atoms of the cation. In TEAA, only one acidic hydrogen atom can form a hydrogen bond with acetate anion. We also calculated the SDFs of methyl carbon of acetate and present the results in Fig. S8. We observe the increase in vdW contacts from DEAA to TEAA. Among the two available alkyl chains, the methyl carbon of acetate is associated to only one alkyl chain of DEAA. Whereas, methyl carbon of acetate is found around the three alkyl chains of TEAA. A clear distinction is observed between the distribution of methyl carbon in DEAA and TEAA. The increase of mole fraction of IL also affects the distribution. The distribution of methyl carbon increases around the cation with IL concentration. To investigate the structure of hydrogen bonds in these solutions, we calculated the site-site radial distribution functions. The results acquired for HN (H connected to N in cation) –OC (carboxylate oxygen of anion), HN–OD (O of DMF) and HC (formyl hydrogen of DMF)–OC at four different mole fractions of IL are presented in Fig. 7 for both the ILs. The position of the first peak in HN–OC occurs at 0.18 nm for all the mole fractions (Fig. 7a and b). The location of this peak is constant and does not change with the mole fractions of IL and with the change in cation of IL. With the increase in mole fraction of ILs, the height of the first peaks of RDFs decreases. Peak heights are slightly larger in case of TEAA as compared to DEAA. The first minimum is located at 0.26 nm for DEAA. The long-range correlation between ions can be seen in DEAA but is not observed in TEAA due to the unavailability of a second acidic hydrogen atom on the cation. However, both the ILs show sharp first peaks, and this behavior is because of the formation of a strong hydrogen bond between cation and anion. The second maximum and minimum are found at 0.3 nm and 0.37 nm, respectively, for DEAA. Heights of first and second peaks decrease with the increase in mole fraction of IL. With increasing concentration of IL, the coordination number increased due to more number of ions available in first solvation shell of DMF. HN–OD RDFs are shown in Fig. 7c and d. The sharp first peaks at 0.19 nm are found with the first minima at 0.26 and 0.28 nm for DEAA and TEAA, respectively. Similar to the earlier case, here also TEAA does not show any peak at 0.3 nm, but DEAA shows. The trend in peak heights of these RDFs is opposite to the trend in cation-anion (Fig. 7a) RDFs. The decrease in peak height with IL concentration is observed for cation-anion. HN–OD coordination number increases with the addition of ionic liquid, which can be observed from the number integrals. Atom-atom coordination numbers are given in Table S5. The ions of IL are more available to form the hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atom of DMF. Formyl hydrogen atom can form hydrogen bonds and this type of hydrogen bonds can be termed as ‘induced’ or ‘cooperative’. This induced hydrogen bonds can be employed to understand and the design of enantioselective catalysts [86]. Fig. 7e and f show the RDF between H (formyl hydrogen of DMF) and O(ACT) of carboxylate. The height of the first peak is several orders less than that of cation-anion (Fig. 7a) RDF. In anion–DMF RDFs, the increase in peak height describes the increase in correlations of anion–DMF at higher concentration of IL. The location of the first minimum moves slightly towards larger distance with the increase in DMF concentration. Similar trends can be observed from the COM RDFs (Fig. 5). For both the ILs, the variation in the height of the first peak in cation-anion RDFs is high as compared to cation–DMF and anion–DMF pairs. Chaban et al., by studying the binary mixtures of 1-butyl3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ionic liquid and acetonitrile mixture, suggested that the ions were polarized not only by each other but also by the acetonitrile to a large extent and the correlation between cation and anion decreases with the increase in IL concentration [78]. Our results are consistent with these reported results. 3.2.1 Dynamic properties To study the effects of concentration of ILs on dynamics, mean square displacements, their respective log-log plots, and slopes were calculated for four mole fractions and showed in Figs. S9 (DEAA + DMF) and S10 (TEAA + DMF). MSDs of DMF (Figs. S9 g and S10 g) are much higher than cation or anion of IL at lower mole fraction of IL in both the IL mixtures. MSDs of cation and anion are similar; indicate the correlated motion of ions and the possible formation of ion pairs. Even at higher concentration of DMF, the MSDs of ions show this similarity. This type of behavior was found earlier for trialkylammonium IL + water mixtures [58]. DMF facilitates the motion of both the ions of ILs as it can be seen from the larger MSDs from the figure at XIL = 0.2 and 0.4. Figs. S9 and S10 also show the log-log plots of MSDs and the slopes of log-log plots. The slope of ions is less than unity, which indicates less diffusive behavior of ions. Simulation time of 200 ns was performed for DEAA and TEAA mixtures, and the diffusive regime was found between 50 and 100 ns. Slope values for DMF are close to unity at lower mole fractions of IL, and the fluctuation of the slope is lower when compared to ions of ILs. At higher concentration of IL, the values of slope deviate more from the unity. The deviation can be seen even for DMF in IL rich region, which is due to high viscous nature of ILs. The slope of log-log plots is defined as a parameter follows: (1) β t = dln < ∆ r 2 t > dln t The self-diffusion coefficients were calculated from Einstein relation [87]. This relation is applicable only when the slope of a log-log plots reaches unity, and the time is sufficiently large. To satisfy this relation, particle needs to travel the multiple times of solvation shell. Fig. S9 for DEAA and Fig. S10 for TEAA show that the slope values are near to unity for low mole fractions of IL. The calculated diffusion coefficients of cations, anions, and DMF are shown in Table S6. The diffusion coefficients of cations and anions are similar, which is related to the motion of the ion pair. The diffusion coefficients of DMF are larger when compared to cation and anion at lower mole fractions of IL. At higher concentration of IL, the diffusion coefficients of ions and DMF are similar. The decrease in diffusion with the increase in IL concentration in the mixture of imidazolium IL and acetonitrile was observed from previous studies [78]. Our results are consistent with previous studies where the diffusion of ionic entities of IL mixtures decreases with the addition of ILs [78,88–92]. These mixtures attain the stability due to the delicate balance between breaking and making of hydrogen bonds of cation…anion, cation…DMF and anion…DMF. From the experimental studies [45] of these mixtures, Attri et al. showed that DMF forms a hydrogen bond with the alkyl chain cation (DEA), and the other part of cation interacts more with acetate ion. Three types of hydrogen bonds, investigated structurally in Fig. 7, were considered for the analysis of hydrogen bond dynamics. Autocorrelation functions for these hydrogen bonds were calculated. Hydrogen bond time correlation function approach [93–98] was used to calculate the relaxation time of H-bond. The hydrogen bond population variable h(t) is defined as 1 when a particular pair is hydrogen-bonded at time t and equals to zero if it is not hydrogen bonded. Here we have adopted standard geometric criterion where a donor (D)–acceptor (A) distance is 0.35 nm and the A–D–H angle cutoff is 300. The correlation function which is defined here (Eq. (3)) does not depend on the continuous presence of hydrogen bond [99,100]. The probability of finding hydrogen-bonded pair at time t is given by the correlation function C HB (t) as shown in Eq. (3). This correlation function mainly depends on two factors one is diffusion of particles and the bond breaking and making processes between hydrogen bonded pairs. The breaking and making of hydrogen bonds primarily related to the orientation of particles. These two factors affect the presence of hydrogen bonds. Therefore, diffusion and density may affect the overall hydrogen bond dynamics. (3) C HB t = < h 0 h t > < h 2 0 > This correlation function C HB (t) is defined to allow the reformation of the hydrogen bond. We have tried fitting with mono, bi and tri exponential functions. The best fit is obtained with triexponential function. Hydrogen bond relaxation times were calculated by fitting the autocorrelation functions up to 10 ns using Eq. (4). Fitting parameters for hydrogen bond autocorrelation functions are shown in Table S7. (4) C t = a 1 exp − t / τ 1 + a 2 exp − t / τ 2 + 1 − a 1 − a 2 exp − t / τ 3 ) The hydrogen bond autocorrelation functions are presented in Fig. S11. The fastest time scale is ascribed to inertial rotation of molecules or ions. Slower components are related to ion– DMF and ion-ion hydrogen bond life times. From Fig. 3, strong association is present between cation and anion. The dynamics of hydrogen bonds are expected to be slow between cation and anion. The change in the decay of autocorrelation functions of cation…anion (Fig. S11a and d) is much smaller and looks close. The change in hydrogen bond dynamics with the addition of DMF is small. The dynamics of hydrogen bond between cation and DMF become slow with the addition of IL and are faster than cation…anion. The dynamics of these two types of hydrogen bonds look similar after 0.4 mole fraction of IL. After this mole fraction, the association of cation…DMF occurs due to the highly viscous nature of the mixtures, which was caused by the dominant ion-dipole interactions and slower dynamics of ILs at higher concentrations. The association is further confirmed by calculating the SDF of cation and anion around DMF (Fig. 8 ) at different mole fractions. The slowest relaxation times (τ3) are shown in Fig. 9 . The hydrogen bond auto-correlation functions (Figs. S11c and S8e) of anion…DMF are similar to cation…DMF pairs. The longer relaxation times of (Fig. 9) cation…DMF and anion…DMF at higher mole fraction of IL are due to the formation of cation-DMF and anion-DMF aggregates. The formation of these aggregates primarily depends on the ion-dipole and hydrogen bonding interactions. At higher concentration of ILs, DMF forms more aggregates. This can be seen from the increase in RDF heights. DMF also associates with ions of IL at higher composition of IL, which can be seen from the increase in relaxation time. One can observe that the irregularity in relaxation time of cation-anion with the variation of mole fraction of IL. At higher concentrations of ILs, the breaking of hydrogen bonds between cation and anion facilitates the cation…DMF and anion…DMF hydrogen bonds. So, the relaxation times of two types of hydrogen bonds, cation---DMF and anion-DMF, increases. The increase in relaxation times of these two types of hydrogen bonds is high at DMF rich region. After 0.4 mole fraction, cation…DMF and anion…DMF hydrogen bond relaxation times are close to cation…anion. This type of behavior shows that at IL rich regions, the dynamics of all the particles are similar. Amide bond of DMF stays more time with cation than anion at all the X IL. This observation suggests that DMF is more solvated by ionic entities at higher concentration of ILs. In most of the cases, the values of hydrogen bond relaxation time are higher for TEAA than DEAA mixtures. The higher molecular weight of TEAA and increased van der Waals forces between cations with the increase in alkyl chain length cause slow dynamics. We have also calculated the autocorrelation functions considering the cutoff angle as 60° and the distance cutoff from the minima of corresponding RDFs. The results are presented in Table S8. We found that there are some differences between the two cut off angles, 60° and 30°. Overall, the increase in relaxation times of cation-DMF and anion-DMF is observed in both the cases, while the corresponding values for cation-anion pair remain similar. Biswas and co-workers [101] found that the decay of hydrogen bond auto-correlation functions of water-tetramethylurea show behavior according to a triexponential function. Similar behavior was also observed for aqueous micellar solutions [102–104] and cylodextrins [105], moisturized proteins and DNA [106,107]. The dynamics of these mixtures were further investigated by residence auto-correlation functions (Fig. S12) and corresponding residence time (Fig. 9). The time autocorrelation function C Res (t) is defined as [97,99] Eq. (5). (5) C Res t = < g 0 g t > < g 0 2 > , where g(t) is the residence population variable. g(t) reaches unity if the pair of atoms or molecules present in the given cut-off value and is considered as zero otherwise. The best fit is obtained through fitting with triexponential function. Residence auto-correlation functions were fitted with Eq. (4). Fitting parameters for residence autocorrelation functions are shown in Table S9. All the residence auto-correlation functions were calculated by considering the center of mass. For a particular mole fraction, cation…anion residence time correlation functions decay slower and show higher residence time. Residence dynamics show a similar trend as hydrogen-bond dynamics. TEAA shows higher residence times than DEAA. The change in cation…anion residence times is low across all the mole fractions. Maximum residence time for cation…anion is 2288 ps at 0.2 mole fraction of DEAA and 2414 ps at 0.8 mole fraction of TEAA. Minimum was found at 0.4 mole fraction which is 2111 ps for DEAA and 0.6 mole fraction of TEAA shows the minimum residence time of 2053 ps. DMF rich region shows lower residence times for cation…DMF and anion…DMF. The increase in residence times is higher at lower mole fraction of both the ILs. For example, the residence time of DEAA-DMF at 0.2 mole fraction is 1599 ps and is increased to 1939 ps at 0.4 mole fraction. Residence time for DEAA-DMF at 0.6 mole fraction is 2396 ps and is increased to 2402 ps in 0.8 mole fraction of IL where the increase is low. Similarly, we observe similar results for TEAA, where the increase is more at lower mole fractions and less at higher mole fractions. Higher residence times at IL rich region suggest that breaking of a hydrogen bond is difficult due to increased viscosity and molecular weight. Similarly, Chang et al. have also observed the increase in translational motion of ions with the addition of water in the aqueous mixtures of IL. They have also observed that ion-pair dissociation of IL occurs with the addition of water which leads to the decrease in dissociation time of ions [58]. Similarly, previous studies observed that increase in the concentration of the molecular solvent decreases the mobility of constituent particles in the mixtures [78,88–92]. The change in properties of the molecules with the surroundings and the formation of long-lived and short-lived aggregates in the first solvation shell can also be explained by calculating velocity auto-correlation functions (VACF). (Fig. S13) We find that the first minimum of cation, anion, and DMF was deepest for higher mole fraction of IL. TEAA shows a deeper minimum than DEAA in all cases. As the IL concentration increases the well depth increases in both the cases. Anion and DMF show only one minimum. It can be seen that cations show rattling motion in cages that are formed by neighbor entities for both ILs. In TEAA, depths of the minima are higher than DEAA due to increased van der Waals interactions and other nonspecific interactions. TEAA and DEAA participate in the formation of aggregates. This type of behavior was also observed previously for ammonium-based cations [60,108]. Varela and co-workers [108] analyzed the structure of mixtures of ethyl ammonium nitrate (EAN) with two alcohols and water. They also studied the dynamics of these mixtures. From their study, it was showed that the effect of the concentration of cosolvent on structure and dynamics is significant. Among these three cosolvents, only water molecules undergo rattling motion. Water molecules were tightly bound to their neighbor molecules. We have also observed this behavior for cations in this study. So, cation tightly binds to its neighbor molecules. These correlations are not present after the second minimum (Fig. S13). The rattling motions were not found for anions and DMF molecules, but the depth of the VACF increases with the increase in IL concentration and also with alkyl chain length. The characteristic of the diffusive motion of anion and DMF molecules is observed from VACFs. The correlations between ions and molecules progressively decrease with the addition of DMF, which suggests that cations are more tightly bound to the hydrogen-bonded network than anion and DMF. The dynamics of mixtures were further investigated by calculating the vibrational density of states (VDOS). VDOS were calculated using Fourier transform of the VACFs (Fig. 10 ). A broad peak is observed in the low frequency region. This peak corresponds to collision frequency of inter-molecular modes [60]. The height of the peak increases with mole fraction of IL. Red shift is observed for the bands at 250 cm− 1 from DEAA to TEAA. Fumino et al. studied the vibrational modes of ILs at low frequency regions using far-infrared spectroscopy [109–112]. They found that the vibrational bands at low frequency are due to inter-molecular interactions. Similar to their study, we have also found the vibrational bands at low-frequency regions which can be assigned to inter-molecular interactions. Table S10 shows the number of ion pairs, number of DMF molecules, and simulation box lengths. Densities are presented in Fig. S14 for the comparison between experimental and computational."
5,Conclusions,"Structure and dynamics of binary mixtures of DEAA, TEAA with DMF were analyzed computationally by calculating the densities, radial distribution functions, spatial distribution functions, hydrogen bond autocorrelation times, and residence times. The density of mixtures increased with the mole fraction of IL. The values of density calculated from the MD simulations qualitatively agreed with experimental data and reproduced the general trend. Nonlinear increase in the density values was observed with the increase in IL concentration. This shows the non-ideal behavior of IL mixtures. From the COM RDFs of neat ionic liquids, it was observed that strong electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding exists between cation and anion. Cation-anion RDF heights are more when compared to cation–cation, and anion–anion RDFs. Cation-anion RDFs in TEAA show lower peak heights than DEAA and also TEAA shows a “double peak”. This can be due to increased weak interactions between cation and anion with alkyl chain length. Cation-cation and anion–anion RDFs show out of phase behavior with cation-anion RDFs for both the ILs. The site–site RDFs suggest that strong hydrogen bonds exist between cation and anion and the peak height increases with alkyl chain length in TEAA. We have also calculated the COM RDFs of cation–cation, anion–anion, cation-anion, cation–DMF, anion–DMF, and DMF–DMF at all mole fractions. Cation-anion RDFs show more peak heights than other COM RDFs. The height of RDFs of cation-anion, cation–cation, and anion–anion decreases with the increase in IL concentration. The decrease is related to the decrease in associations of ions with the addition of IL. The height of RDFs between cation–DMF, anion–DMF, and DMF–DMF increases with X IL. Inclusion of IL increases the interaction between DMF and ions of IL. Coordination numbers for anion–anion are high at IL rich region and increase with IL concentration. For particular mole fraction DMF–DMF coordination numbers are higher than cation–DMF and anion ̶DMF. Increase in coordination number of cation–DMF, anion–DMF, and DMF–DMF was observed. Diffusion coefficients of cations, anions, and DMF molecules decreased with the increase in mole fraction of IL, which is partly due to the aggregation of ions. Diffusion coefficients were calculated from mean square displacements. At lower concentration of IL, diffusion coefficients are high and decreased with the inclusion of IL. Diffusion coefficients of DMF and ions of IL become closer at higher concentration of IL. For a particular mole fraction, DMF shows the higher diffusion coefficient. The decrease in diffusion coefficients is more at DMF rich region. TEAA shows lower diffusion coefficients than DMF for a particular mole fraction of IL Hydrogen bond autocorrelation times of cation…anion vary less with changing the composition of IL. A significant change in cation…DMF and anion…DMF times was observed at lower mole fractions of IL. Hydrogen bond autocorrelation times of cation…DMF and anion…DMF increased with IL concentration. Residence dynamics support hydrogen bond dynamics. Well depth of VACF is higher at IL rich region. VACFs of TEAA are deeper than DEAA. Cations show the rattling motion, whereas anion and DMF show the diffusive behavior for both the ILs. Considering these results in the current work, dynamics of binary mixtures of DEAA, TEAA with DMF mixtures suggest that addition of DMF increases the mobility of ions in mixture. DEAA shows stronger association with DMF than TEAA."
