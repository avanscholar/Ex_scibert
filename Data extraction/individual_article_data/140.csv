0,Introduction,"Global energy demand has risen rapidly in recent decades. However, due to the ongoing pandemic situation the energy demand had reduced considerably. The fossil fuel supply decreases steadily which leads to rapid increase in oil price. Moreover, the combustion of fossil fuel creates major harmful impacts on the environment, resulting in greenhouse gases emission and related adverse effects. Therefore, the pursuit of emerging green and sustainable technologies has gained attention in the last decade. Hydrogen is expected to be a viable and an affordable alternative fuel for the future that could substitute fossil fuels. It produces only water during combustion, and therefore it is termed as a clean and green fuel [1]. In addition, hydrogen has an energy content of 122 KJ/g, which is 2.75 times greater than that of fossil fuels. However, the major disadvantage of using hydrogen is due to its highly flammable nature and its transportation requires special apparatus to prevent the explosions. Hence, special attention is required in order to setup hydrogen storage tanks in vehicles. Hydrogen production can typically be derived from physicochemical and biological methods. Approximately 85%–90% of commercial hydrogen production presently are derived from physicochemical methods like electrolysis, steam reforming of hydrocarbon, and coal gasification [2]. Nevertheless, the commercially adopted conventional processes, despite high quantity of hydrogen production, require intensive energy and emit polluting greenhouse gases [3]. Thus, it is necessary to develop safe, renewable, and inexpensive production lines of hydrogen, such as biohydrogen, which requires meagre energy for its operations with a relatively more environmentally friendly process than physicochemical methods [4]. A wide variety of biologically driven methods have been pursued to generate hydrogen, including direct and indirect biophotolysis, photofermentation, and dark fermentation [5]. The dark fermentation process is considered to be the best technically feasible procedure since it requires very little or low external energy to produce hydrogen much faster than direct and indirect photo-fermentation processes [6,7]. Biohydrogen can be produced from organic waste/wastewater on a sustainable basis [8]. The waste biomass residues also are considered to be essential as substrates which have recently gained great attention for dark fermentation process. The use of waste biomass has several advantages such as affordable raw material cost, plentiful availability, and high carbohydrate content (more than 40 to 65% of dry weight). Globally the biomass residues (for example, waste from trees such as bushes, fallen dry leaves, barks, and crop residues) account for over 220 billion tons a year [9]. The crop residues were used as animal feed, the bushes and barks were cut into small pellets and used for electricity generation. Among them the fallen dry leaves remain non-utilized and are typically dumped directly into landfill which takes several months to decay or burnt to ash causing the emission of polluted gases to the atmosphere which eventually results in adverse environmental effects. Hence, utilizing such unexplored cellulosic biomasses for dark fermentation is one of the feasible methods and a new approach for the production of hydrogen and other byproducts. Fallen dry leaves are garden waste biomass with high content of cellulose and can be better used for renewable energy production using microorganisms. In comparison with other biomass residues the presence of lignin in leaves is comparatively low. However, the direct utilization of these wastes for renewable energy production is difficult to achieve, because of the presence of lignin and polysaccharides in the form of cellulose and hemicellulose. Hence, pretreatment is essential to remove the lignin and convert the polysaccharides into simple reducing sugars, which serve as the carbon source for microorganisms involved in generating hydrogen aided by enzymes (hydrogenases) in the microbial cell [10]. E. coli is a laboratory workhorse, and it easily adapts to diverse environmental conditions. It follows mixed acid fermentation and produces hydrogen from formate via formate hydrogen lyase (FHL) system [11]. Furthermore, the well-known facultative anaerobic hydrogen producers, Enterobacter cloacae and E. coli, exhibited highly identical hydrogenases (Hyd3) large subunits during sequence analysis [12]. There are various pretreatment methods (physical, mechanical, thermal, chemical, and enzymatic) that are successful in the production of total reducing sugars (TRS) from cellulosic biomass [13–17]. Among them, the chemical pretreatment (acid hydrolysis) and enzymatic hydrolysis were the feasible methods to obtain maximum TRS from cellulosic biomass. However, acid hydrolysis not only produced reducing sugars, but also produced a number of by-products such as furans and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), which inhibited the growth of hydrogen-producing microorganisms [18]. On the other hand, enzymatic hydrolysis (enzymatic saccharification by Aspergillus niger) takes nearly 3–5 days to produce TRS from the cellulosic biomass. Enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulosic materials by A. niger is considered as an efficient low cost pretreatment method. However, it is a time-consuming process requiring a long incubation period (3–5 days). Hence, the use of commercial enzymes such as Viscozyme L (VL), an enzyme complex from Aspergillus sp., seems promising. VL contains endo-beta-glucanase, xylanase, cellulase and hemicellulase. VL was used for the pretreatment of cellulosic materials [19]. Even though VL is little expensive, the main advantage of using a commercial enzyme is that it requires a shorter incubation period (within 2–6 h). Typically, within a day the pretreatment process is complete, and the fermentation process can start immediately when using the commercial enzymes. In the present study, we used various pretreatment and hydrolysis processes for the successful conversion of cellulosic and hemicellulosic materials present in the garden wastes into simple reducing sugars for the efficient production of hydrogen by dark fermentation using E. coli. The results showed the combined hydrolysis (acid hydrolysis followed by enzymatic hydrolysis) process was most efficient to produce hydrogen from garden wastes."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Garden waste collection and preparation,"2.1 Garden waste collection and preparation The garden wastes were categorized into the garden grass, the fallen dry leaves from plants and trees, and the last one from small bushes. Among them, more than 80% of garden wastes consist of fallen dry leaves, therefore the fallen dry leaves from a lawn of Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand − 13.738359°N 100.532097°E) were collected. The garden wastes were dried at 60 °C for 24 h before transforming into a fine powder using a laboratory blender and sieved into the desired size with a 20 mesh size sieve which allows the particle smaller than 0.850 mm in size. Then the large particles were collected and ground again to obtain desired size. In order to use the same garden waste for long term usage, it was necessary to store them in a sealed plastic bag at 2–4 °C to retain the same structure and to prevent the fungal contamination. The physico-chemical characteristics of garden wastes are presented in Table 1 ."
3,Microorganism,"2.2 Microorganism E. coli-K12 [20], an in-house bacterial strain was used in this study. A loopful of E.coli cells was incubated overnight in 20 mL of LB medium at 37 °C under anaerobic condition which was later used as a stock culture. Then E. coli cells from the stock culture was transferred into 100 mL of sterile freshly prepared synthetic medium modified from Honda et al. [21] consisting of 10 g/L NaCl, 10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, 5 mM ferric ammonium citrate, and 50 mM MOPS buffer pH 7. The culture was incubated at 35 ± 2 °C for 20 h with an orbital shaker at 200 rpm. After incubation, the cell pellets were collected by centrifugation at 12000g for 10 min and kept for fermentation experiments."
4,Pretreatment and hydrolysis of garden wastes,"2.3 Pretreatment and hydrolysis of garden wastes The garden wastes (fallen dry leaves) were subjected to pretreatment processes by heat, sonication, as well as by alkali, acid, enzymatic (Viscozyme L) hydrolysis, and finally by combined hydrolysis (optimized conditions of acid hydrolysis + enzymatic hydrolysis) before the analysis of the released reducing sugar content. All tests were done in triplicates and the standard deviation values are shown as error bars (mean ± SD, n = 3), the average or mean values were reported. The pictorial representation of garden wastes collection and pretreatment process to obtain fermentable sugars is shown in Fig. 1 . 2.3.1 Heat pretreatment Initially, 1.0 g of dry garden waste was mixed with 20 mL of distilled water (5% (w/v) solids loading) and used for heat pretreatment process at various time periods (15, 30, and 45 min) and at different temperatures (60, 80, 100, and 121 °C). using water bath (with different temperature range set options) and autoclaved at 121 °C at 15 psi. After the heat pretreatment, the garden waste samples were collected from the water bath and autoclaved condition, then cooled down to room temperature. The samples were filtered using Whatman filter-paper (No.1), and then the final liquid portion of the samples was analyzed for the maximum recovery of reducing sugar, followed by fermentation process. 2.3.2 Ultrasonication 1.0 g of dry garden waste was mixed with 20 mL of distilled water (5% (w/v) solids loading) and ultrasonicated using a probe-type sonicator (Hielscher, model-UP400S, Germany). The power, working voltage, and frequency were, 400 W, 220 V, and 24 kHz respectively. The ultrasonication time was varied from 10 to 60 min. The samples were collected after each sonication and filtered using Whatman filter-paper (No.1). The final liquid portion of the samples were analyzed for the maximum recovery of reducing sugar, followed by the fermentation process. 2.3.3 Alkali and acid hydrolysis 1.0 g of dry garden waste was mixed with 20 mL of diluted NaOH, or aqueous H2SO4 at various concentrations (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3 (% w/v), 5% (w/v) solids loading and autoclaved at 121 °C at 15 psi for 15 min. The initial pH of the sample was around 6.5. After acid hydrolysis, the pH was reduced to a range of 3–4. On the other hand, after alkaline hydrolysis the pH was increased to a range of 8–9 (pH varied depending on the concentration of acid and alkali used). After hydrolysis, the samples were filtered using Whatman filter-paper (No.1) to remove the residues present in the hydrolyzate. Then the samples were allowed to cool down to ambient room temperature. The final liquid portion of the samples were analyzed for the maximum recovery of reducing sugar followed by fermentation process. The hydrolyzate was neutralized to pH 7.0 by adding 1 N NaOH or 1 N HCl solution before the fermentative hydrogen production. 2.3.4 Enzymatic hydrolysis Viscozyme L (VL) was procured from Novozymes Biotechnology Co., Ltd. The optimum working conditions for VL are pH ranging between 3.3 and 5.5 and temperatures ranging between 25 and 55 °C. 1.0 g of dry garden waste was mixed with 20 mL of VL enzyme aqueous solution (5% (w/v) solids loading) at various concentrations of VL enzyme, different initial pH, temperature (T) and incubation time (h). Four sets of experiments were carried out to investigate the optimum working conditions of VL enzyme on the saccharification of garden waste: (i) to study the effect of different VL concentrations (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 (% v/v)), (ii) to study the effect of different pH 3.0–7.0, by adjusting the pH with either a buffer containing 0.1 M of citric acid or 0.1 M of trisodium citrate, (iii) to investigate the effect of different temperatures (30–55 °C) and (iv) to study the effect of different incubation time (1–6 h). After each set of experiments the samples were analyzed for maximum recovery of reducing sugar followed by fermentation process. 2.3.5 Combined hydrolysis The sequential treatment involving acid hydrolysis followed by enzymatic hydrolysis was carried out at the optimum conditions arrived from acid and enzymatic hydrolysis experiments. 1.0 g of dry garden waste was first hydrolyzed with optimized acid concentration and then the samples were subjected to an optimized VL enzyme saccharification conditions obtained from the above mentioned investigation and filtered using Whatman filter paper (No.1). The hydrolyzate obtained from the combined hydrolysis process was analyzed for the recovery of maximum reducing sugar content followed by dark fermentation process."
5,Fermentation of released sugars by E. coli,"2.4 Fermentation of released sugars by E. coli The hydrogen production experiments were performed in 100 mL glass vials with a working volume of 50 mL containing 20 mL of pretreated garden waste samples, 0.1 g dry cells of E. coli, and 20 mL of a nutrient solution consisting of 100 mM NH4HCO3, 1 mM K2HPO4, 50 mM NaHCO3, 0.2 mM CuSO4, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM MnSO4, 3 mM FeSO4 and a trace amount of CoCl2. 10 mL of dilute 1 N NaOH or HCL was used to adjust the pH, modified from Cui et al. [22]. Argon gas was passed into the reaction vials for 5–10 min to create an anaerobic atmosphere which favors the E. coli cells to produce hydrogen. The reaction bottles were placed on the magnetic stirrer. All the tests were performed at ambient temperatures (33 ± 2 °C) under dark conditions. Samples were collected at regular intervals to measure hydrogen and other metabolite production as well as assessing the sugar degradation efficiency during dark fermentation."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods The hydrogen production was determined using a gas chromatograph (Perichrom, France). The column molecular sieve was 5A 60/80 mesh, argon was used as a carrier gas with a flow rate of 30 mL/min and equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The temperature of injector and detector were 100 °C and column temperature was 50 °C. The hydrogen sample taken using a gas-tight syringe with a volume of 0.5 mL was further injected into GC at 2.7 psi pressure [23]. A standard curve was obtained by injecting different concentrations of pure hydrogen into the 20 mL gas bottles sealed with tight rubber septum and the samples were mixed well. 1 mL of hydrogen gas samples from the bottles were drawn using an air-tight syringe (3 mL) and injected into the GC for analysis. The same procedure was followed for the samples at each time interval, the total volume of biogas production was measured by a water displacement apparatus. The hydrogen yield calculation was done according to the Ramprakash and Incharoensakdi [20,23]. The sugars, volatile fatty acids and alcohols were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with UV and refractive index detectors, (Shimadzu -LC-0A, Japan), equipped with Aminex HPX-87H and C18 columns (Bio-Rad Labs, USA) operated at 65 °C with 5 mM H2SO4 as mobile-phase (0.6 mL/min) [24]. Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin contents of garden wastes were determined by following the NREL methods (National Renewable Energy Laboratory) [25]. Total chemical oxygen demand (COD) was analyzed using open reflux method. Total solids (TS), volatile solids (VS), ash content, overall biomass concentrations (wet and dry weight methods), the residual sugars and pH were analyzed according to the standard methods of APHA [26]."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Effect of pretreatment and hydrolysis on total reducing sugar (TRS) production,"3.1 Effect of pretreatment and hydrolysis on total reducing sugar (TRS) production The physical, chemical, and biological structural changes in the cellulosic biomass occur after the pretreatment. The pretreatment process breaks down the complex cellulosic biomass into simple fermentable sugars. Hence, it is really important to understand about the kind of pretreatment required to obtain more fermentable sugar for the bacterial fermentation process. 3.1.1 Heat treatment Heat treatment was carried out at different temperatures such as 60, 80, 100 and 121 °C and the reducing sugar profile obtained at different temperature is shown in Fig. 2 A. The given incubation time of 15, 30 and 45 min also played a crucial role during the heat treatment. Increasing the temperature gradually increased the reducing sugar production and attained the maximum at 100 °C. Increasing the temperature beyond 100 °C resulted in considerable reduction in reducing sugar production in autoclave pretreated samples at 121 °C, this might be due to dissociation of sugars in the garden waste. From the results, the maximum fermentable sugar was released after heating at 100 °C for 15 min. The available fermentable sugar was decreased when the incubation time increased beyond 15 min, which might be due to degradation of sugars at a long incubation time. Similar results were reported by Kumar et al. [27], using jatropha wastes. The optimum temperature was 100 °C with incubation time of 15 min to release 19% of TRS from 1.0 g of dry garden waste. 3.1.2 Ultrasonication The effect of sonication time on fermentable sugar production from garden wastes was investigated, and the results obtained are shown in Fig. 2B. Increasing the sonication time increased the reducing sugar concentration and the maximum total reducing sugar was obtained from 50 min sonicated sample, with a yield of 21% total reducing sugar per g of dry garden waste. Increasing the sonication time beyond 50 min decreased the TRS yield from 21% to 18%, this is due to the reason that the prolonged ultrasound treatment time would rather weaken than break the bonds between the sugar monomers of cellulose [24]. From the results, it was found that the maximum reducing sugar was obtained from 50 min of sonication to yield 21% of TRS per g of dry garden waste. In comparison with heat pretreatment, ultrasonication yielded more reducing sugar production. However, due to high power consumption, ultrasonication pretreatment could not be considered as an economical candidate for the garden wastes pretreatment process. 3.1.3 Alkali and acid hydrolysis Chemical pretreatment processes such as acid and alkali hydrolysis using H2SO4 and NaOH respectively, were performed to convert cellulosic and hemicellulosic biomasses into fermentable sugars [28,29]. In this study, it could be noted that the pretreatment of garden wastes under acid and alkali were conducted at high temperatures. The total reducing sugar obtained from the acid and alkali hydrolysis with different concentrations is shown in Fig. 2C. The results revealed that the maximum total reducing sugar release of 29% and 24% were obtained from H2SO4 and NaOH pretreatment respectively. The 2% H2SO4 and 2% NaOH were found to be the optimum concentrations to achieve the high total reducing sugar yields. A higher concentration of acid and alkali could degrade the sugar monomers and also release furans, which inhibit the growth of hydrogen-producing microbes [30]. It was observed that the total reducing sugar content with H2SO4 pretreatment was higher than that with NaOH pretreatment at the same (2%) concentrations. In comparison with the optimized conditions of heat treatment, ultrasonication and alkali hydrolysis, the optimized concentration (2%) of acid hydrolysis released comparatively more total reducing sugar. Hence, the acid hydrolysis using H2SO4 with the optimum concentration of 2% was found to be a feasible pretreatment method to obtain more reducing sugar production from garden wastes. However, the major setback in acid hydrolysis is the production of inhibitors which affect the hydrogen production process [31]. 3.1.4 Enzymatic hydrolysis Enzymatic hydrolysis tends to be an efficient pretreatment method owing to the release of more fermentable sugar from the cellulosic materials [32] without producing any inhibitors during its operations. Concentration of VL, pH, temperature and incubation time are the main factors which affect the saccharification of garden wastes. Hence, the effect of concentration of VL enzyme, pH, temperature and incubation time on the release of total reducing sugar from 1 g of dry garden waste were investigated, and the results are shown in Table 2 . The total reducing sugar formation continuously increased when the VL enzyme concentration increased from 0.25% to 2%, but the increment was very marginal with 2% to 4% of VL enzyme. Hence, 2% VL enzyme was used to examine the effect of pH on the saccharification of garden waste. The total reducing sugar formation increased with increasing pH. The optimum pH was between 4.0 and 5.0. Thus, the effect of temperature on the saccharification of garden wastes was investigated at pH 5.0. The total reducing sugar formation gradually increased with increasing temperature. The optimum temperature was obtained at 45 °C. Increasing the temperature beyond 45 °C decreased the total reducing sugar formation. The total reducing sugar formation gradually increased with increasing the incubation time. However, the increment remained the same after 5 h of incubation. Hence the optimum condition for incubation time on the saccharification of garden waste was found to be 5 h. From the results, the optimum conditions for the saccharification of garden waste were VL enzyme concentration 2%, pH 5.0, temperature 45 °C and incubation time 5 h. From the above mentioned optimized conditions the VL enzyme pretreatment released 34% of total reducing sugar (Fig. 2D). In summary, among the other pretreatment methods, enzymatic hydrolysis by VL enzyme released more reducing sugars followed by acid hydrolysis. Hence, in corporation of this two pretreatment methods in a sequential process enhanced higher reducing sugar formation during pretreatment of garden waste. 3.1.5 Combined hydrolysis The garden waste were initially pretreated by the optimized acid (H2SO4) hydrolysis (2%) followed by optimized enzymatic hydrolysis. The maximum TRS production of 39% was achieved from the combined hydrolysis (Fig. 2E). Thus, the combined hydrolysis process was the best pretreatment method which had greater efficiency in converting the complex celluloses (polysaccharides) into fermentable sugars in comparison with other pretreatment methods. Hence, the pretreatment methods are essential to convert the complex sugar molecules present in the garden waste into fermentable sugars which were then used as an essential carbon source for bacterial hydrogen production through dark fermentation."
9,Effect of pretreatment and hydrolysis on biohydrogen production,"3.2 Effect of pretreatment and hydrolysis on biohydrogen production The hydrolyzate of the garden waste obtained from the aforementioned pretreatment and hydrolysis process was fermented to produce hydrogen using E. coli. The initial pH of the hydrolyzate was adjusted in the range 6.5–7.2 by the addition of 10 mL of dilute 1 N NaOH or HCl. The results of using hydrolyzate derived from various pretreatments and hydrolysis processes for the production of hydrogen are shown in Fig. 3 . The maximum cumulative hydrogen production (41 mL/g) was attained from the hydrolyzate obtained at 100 °C for 15 min, whereas those obtained from 30 and 45-min incubated samples produced 33 and 31 mL of hydrogen/g dry garden waste respectively (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, hydrolyzate obtained from ultrasonication with different incubation times (40 50, and 60 min) showed the maximum cumulative hydrogen production of 59 mL of hydrogen/g dry garden waste from 50 min sonicated samples with those from 40 and 60 min sonicated samples producing 53 and 56 mL of hydrogen/g dry garden waste respectively (Fig. 3B). Next, the hydrolyzate obtained from alkali (NaOH) hydrolysis with different NaOH concentrations (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3%) were used for hydrogen production. As shown in Fig. 3C, the maximum cumulative hydrogen production of 68 mL of hydrogen/g dry garden waste was attained with 2% NaOH hydrolyzed samples. Similar studies by Cui and Shen [33], reported the maximum of 19.25 mL of hydrogen/g dry grass obtained from NaOH pretreated grass. The present study shows that the NaOH pretreated garden waste produces comparatively more hydrogen than that with grass waste. On the other hand, the effect of different concentrations of H2SO4 (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3%) hydrolysis on hydrogen production is shown in Fig. 3D. The total hydrogen production from the untreated garden wastes was 36 mL/g dry garden waste, whereas the total hydrogen production from the acid hydrolyzed samples increased with increasing acid concentration from 0.5 to 2% attaining nearly 74 mL of hydrogen/g dry garden waste. The decrease in the overall hydrogen yield was observed when H2SO4 concentration was higher than 2%. This may occur due to the formation of furans and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and also a higher concentration of acid degrades the reducing sugars present in the garden wastes. From the result, the maximum hydrogen yield from the 2% acid hydrolyzed sample was nearly 74 mL of hydrogen/g dry garden waste, a 2-fold higher yield when compared with the untreated sample. Cui et al. [22] used HCl pretreated poplar leaves for dark fermentative hydrogen production and reported the maximum of 33.45 mL/g dry poplar leaves. Similar studies were carried out by Cui and Shen [33] using HCl pretreated grass waste for dark fermentative hydrogen production where the maximum of 72 mL of hydrogen/g dry grass was attained. The present study using H2SO4 pretreated garden wastes produces comparatively more hydrogen than the previously reported studies. Next, when the hydrolysis was done with different concentrations of VL, the hydrogen production was increased with increasing VL concentration up to 2% (Fig. 3E). Increasing the VL concentration beyond this level was unfavorable for the production of hydrogen. In this regard, it is important to optimize the concentration of VL so that the overall cost of the operation is not increased. The maximum hydrogen production of 89 mL of hydrogen/g dry garden wastes, a 2.4-fold higher hydrogen production in comparison with untreated garden waste, was observed in a 2% VL enzyme pretreated sample (Fig. 3E). Similar work using enzymatic pretreated poplar leaves for dark fermentative hydrogen production reported the maximum of 44 mL of hydrogen/g dry poplar leaves [22]. The use of garden waste in the present study yields nearly 2-fold higher hydrogen production compared with that using poplar leaves. Finally, hydrogen production after the combined hydrolysis (optimized conditions of acid hydrolysis followed by enzymatic hydrolysis) of garden waste showed the maximum yield of 97 mL of hydrogen/g dry garden waste (Fig. 3F), a 2.7-fold increase compared with untreated garden waste. Abreu et al. [34] used mixed garden wastes and food wastes (90:10 ratio) in a co – fermentation process for hydrogen production and reported the maximum of 46.2 mL of hydrogen/g, which was more than 2-fold lower hydrogen production than that in the present study using only garden waste. This might be due to the presence of some toxic substances and depletion of micronutrients in the food affecting the functions and activities of key enzymes and inhibiting the microbial growth [35]. Overall, this study demonstrated that the pretreatment and hydrolysis process enhanced hydrogen production when compared with garden waste without pretreatment. The combined hydrolysis was the best in terms of fermentable sugar production as well as hydrogen production, followed by VL enzyme and acid hydrolysis. The mechanism of hydrogen production using fermentable sugars such as glucose, xylose, and arabinose obtained from cellulosic and hemicellulosic biomasses through bacterial fermentation has been previously reported [36–38]. The cumulative hydrogen production from garden waste with pretreatment was higher than that from the unpretreated garden waste, demonstrating that the pretreatment is necessary for increasing the hydrogen production. In summary, 1 g of dry garden waste contains 44% of carbohydrates. The combined hydrolysis process yielded 88.6% of reducing sugar from the total carbohydrates present in the garden waste. This corresponded to 39% of reducing sugars/g dry garden waste, which yielded 97 mL of hydrogen corresponding to 2.07 mol H2/mol reducing sugar (59.50% of hydrogen produced theoretically) (Fig. 4 ). The result of the present study was compared with those of the previously reported studies using cellulosic waste biomass for the biohydrogen production with appropriate pretreatment methods as shown in Table 3 ."
10,Metabolite formation during dark fermentation,"3.3 Metabolite formation during dark fermentation During dark fermentation, the E. coli produces not only hydrogen, but also acids like acetic, butyric, and propionic acids and solvents like furfural and ethanol [21]. Hence, it is called as a mixed acid fermentation. The metabolites formed during the dark fermentation of hydrolyzate obtained from different pretreatment methods are presented in Table 4 . When a fermentable sugar level increases, it indirectly increases the levels of the metabolites during fermentation. The increase of these metabolites alters the medium pH and affects the fermentation process which indirectly reduces hydrogen production. Since the E. coli performed mixed acid fermentation, the formation of metabolites is unavoidable. The results from Table 4 clearly showed that the major end metabolites were acetate, butyrate, propionate, ethanol, and a trace amount of furfural. The maximum quantity of end metabolites was obtained from the hydrolyzate of the acid hydrolyzed sample. Surprisingly, the end metabolites of liquid products such as ethanol, acetic acid, butyric acid, and propionic acid from the hydrolyzate obtained from combined hydrolysis showed a marginally low quantity, when compared with that from acid hydrolyzed sample. Table 4 clearly shows that the metabolic pathway of E. coli in the present study followed the mixed acid fermentation and acetic acid was found to be a major end metabolite. In addition, the low yield of ethanol of 5.12 mg/g dry garden waste during dark fermentation was obtained from the combined hydrolysis process. These results clearly demonstrated that the E. coli not only produced hydrogen but also produced different liquid metabolites during dark fermentation process."
11,Conclusion,"Cellulosic biomass from garden wastes such as fallen dry leaves and grass residues are abundantly available renewable resources. Using these biomass sources as a raw material for renewable biohydrogen production is promising. However, directly utilizing these wastes for hydrogen generation results in lower volumetric production. In this study, different pretreatment methods such as heat, ultrasonication, alkali, acid, enzymes, and combined hydrolysis were done to obtain the optimum pretreatment conditions for improved biohydrogen production. From the results, the combined hydrolysis process yields the maximum hydrogen (97 mL/g dry garden waste) in-comparison with other pretreated conditions followed by enzymatic and acid hydrolyzed samples with 89 and 74 mL of H2/g dry garden waste respectively. Hence, pretreatment methods are necessary for efficiently utilizing garden wastes as a substrate for biological hydrogen production."
