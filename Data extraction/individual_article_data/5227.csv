0,Introduction,"The current status of the earth planet requires to carefully take into account energy and environmental issues of any human activity and, particularly, of industrial ones. Environmentally benign and renewable technological processes for chemical and, in general, goods production need to be developed [1]. In this new era, a technologically relevant energy vector would be hydrogen. This molecule is a common reactant in industry, heavily used in crude refining, selective hydrogenation reactions and other current industry processes. Its role in the future energy framework of developed societies would be much more important as will become a primary fuel in power cells, cars and other fields [2,3]. The need of a green and economical feasible production of hydrogen in turn demands for new ways of production. Photocatalysis may play a key role in this context, particularly if the sun can be used as the energy source of the reaction [4–9]. All photocatalytic processes are based on the same fundamental mechanism that is the use of light to generate charge carrier species. These species can interact with chemical molecules if they reach the surface of the catalyst. To reach the surface, charge carrier species need to avoid the recombination process. In other words, a photocatalyst needs to harvest light efficiently, the charge carrier species generated need to be separated and transported to the surface, and, finally, produce redox (both oxidation and reduction steps) reactions at the surface of the photocatalyst. The efficiency of the photochemical process is a combination of thermodynamics and relevant kinetic parameters [6,10,11]. Titania (TiO2) is the photocatalytic material by excellence or at least, the main component of photocatalytic formulations, due to a number of properties including its low cost, low toxicity and high biocompatibility, high availability, and versatility in all oxidation and reduction reaction process, particularly for our purposes, in hydrogen production using water : alcohol mixtures [4–9,12]. Alcohols from bio-sources (used in an aqueous reaction medium) are interesting reactant molecules to setting up a truly green process, and those having at least one hydrogen atom bonded to the (carbon) alpha position have been shown to provide high reaction rates [13–24]. Among such bio-derived alcohols, methanol is utilized as a representative example, due to its wide availability and thus its potential as a general and affordable source for the reaction [25–30]. In photocatalytic hydrogen production, the Pt/TiO2 material has become a reference [4,7,10,31–33]. Platinum is the most studied noble metal co-catalysts of titania-based powders due to its high effectiveness. Such optimum performance is based in a significant number of physico-chemical aspects but those usually considered most critical would be; i) the high work function (the higher among noble metals) favoring the electron transfer from semiconductors; ii) the facility for multielectron capture and redox processes, and iii) and efficient capture of protons and subsequent formation of the hydrogen molecule due to the low energy for proton reduction [18,20,26–28,34–48]. In spite of the important activity shown by the Pt/TiO2 system in the photoproduction of hydrogen using bio-alcohols as sacrificial agents, the scientific community actively seeks for better catalysts. In order to improve the performance of the Pt/TiO2 system, ternary composite materials are frequently utilized in the literature [4,6,7]. Among ternary composites the use of metal-metal oxide-sulfide has been shown extreme success in photocatalysis [49]. Here we analyzed the Pt-TiO2-SnS2 system for the first time in the literature and selected it based on its potential utility in the field of hydrogen photoproduction. The latter would be based, on first place, in the expected high activity of the system due to the exceptional properties of the TiO2-SnS2 contact. The interaction between these two semiconductors has been shown to be effective in charge separation under several illumination conditions, particularly visible light [50–52]. The good photo-catalytic performance of the binary system has been tested in the elimination of a broad number of pollutants such as diclofenac or multiple dyes [50–52,53,54,55]. Moreover, some studies indicate that the formation of SnS2 platelets can enhance adsorption of water and polar molecules [56] and also can interact rather efficiently with titania [51,57]. Therefore, the combination with Pt of these two semiconductors having morphological control and enhanced interface interaction can lead to an important system to boost hydrogen photoproduction. We thus analyzed the performance of a carefully engineered Pt-TiO2-SnS2 ternary system in the photoreforming of alcohols to generate hydrogen. In ternary systems, the order of component generation or precipitation in the synthesis step and thus the specific surfaces and interfaces generated in the final material play critical role(s). This point is considered here for materials having a dominant titania component, created with the help of a modern synthesis methodology offering a precise control of all synthetic variables. The performance is quantitatively assessed according to the IUPAC guidelines. This leads to the calculation of the quantum efficiency thorough; i) the measurement of the optical properties of the catalyst suspension at the liquid reaction medium, as well as ii) the modeling of the light-matter interaction at the reactor where catalytic measurements are carried out [58]. This is here combined with a characterization of the materials using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron, and optical (UV–vis and photoluminescence) spectroscopies, scanning and transmission microscopy, as well as the in-situ study of the solids under reaction conditions using infrared spectroscopy. The study shows that ternary systems changes significantly the charge handling properties with respect to binary (particularly Pt/TiO2) composites but also the surface chemistry under dark and illumination conditions, providing the basis to understand the significance of the ternary combination and also a rather efficient way to improve the photoproduction of hydrogen."
1,Material and methods,
2,Preparation and chemical composition of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation and chemical composition of catalysts Catalysts preparation was carried out using a water in oil microemulsion method. Titanium tetraisopropoxide was added in an inverse emulsion containing water dispersed in n-heptane as organic media, using Triton X-100 (Aldrich) as surfactant and hexanol as cosurfactant. Water/Ti and water/surfactant molar ratios were, respectively, 110 and 18 for all samples. The mixture was stirred for 24 h, centrifuged, decanted and rinsed with methanol. Then, the solid was dried at 110 °C for 12 h. After drying, the solid were calcined with a heating ramp (1 °C min−1) up to 450 °C, maintaining this temperature for 2 h. The co-catalysts were introduced by a deposition method using a H2PtCl6 (Aldrich) as precursor. First, the sample was suspended by stirring in a deionized water solution for 30 min. After that, the proper quantity of H2PtCl6 was added to the solution and kept on stirring along 5 min more. Based in previous studies using the anatase major component of the materials, Pt loading was adjusted to get throughout the series a constant 0.4 mol. % -1 wt- %- of Pt on metal basis [22,24]. The reduction was carried out using a NaBH4 (Aldrich) aqueous solution (Pt/NaBH4 molar ratio 1/5). The final solid was profusely rinsed with deionized water, collected by centrifugation and dried at 80 °C. Pt was deposited in each bare semiconductor or in a mixture of them (TiO2 and SnS2) by introducing the noble metal at specific stages of the synthesis procedure. SnS2 was prepared with hydrothermal method in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave at 160 °C for 16 h in aqueous solution of SnCl4 (Sigma Aldrich, 99 %) and thioacetamide (TTA, Aldrich, 99 %). The SnCl4/TTA molar ratio was kept constant at 2 in all samples, but the amount of SnCl4 and TTA was varied in order to have different percentages of SnS2. After naturally cooling of the autoclave to room temperature, the solid was washed with distilled water and dried at 100 °C. This material has been used as reference. Three different ways have been followed to decorate TiO2 with SnS2 and Pt. In the first one, noble metal was introduced onto TiO2, and in a subsequent step, TiO2 with Pt was treated hydrothermally (with aqueous solution of SnCl4 and TTA). In the second way, Pt was deposited on SnS2 and then was mixed with TiO2. In the third way, TiO2 has been mixed with the SnCl4 and TTA solution and was treated hydrothermally forming a composite, followed by the Pt deposition. We denoted the series of samples such as series (T-P)-S for Pt deposition on the oxide, series T-(S-P) for deposition on the sulfide or series (T-S)-P for deposition on the composite. As will be shown later, the most active configuration comes out from the Pt selective deposition on the oxide, series (T-P)-S. The nomenclature used to identify the corresponding materials is T/S for the pure TiO2/SnS2 based catalysts, and T-xS for the ternary systems where x denotes the molar percent of the sulfide material."
3,Characterization of catalysts,"2.2 Characterization of catalysts Chemical analysis (measured using atomic emission with inductive coupled plasma, ICP-AES) was carried out using an Optima 3300DV Perkin Elmer spectrometer. XRD profiles of the samples were obtained using a Policristal X´Pert Pro PANalytical diffractometer using Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation with a 0.02° step. The particle sizes and strain were estimated using XRD using the Williamson–Hall formalism [59]. The BET surface areas were measured by nitrogen physisorption (Micromeritics ASAP 2010). UV–vis diffuse-reflectance spectroscopy experiments were performed on a Shimadzu UV2100 apparatus using Teflon as a reference and the results presented as Kubelka-Munk transform [60]. Band gap analysis for an indirect/direct semiconductor was done following standard procedures; e.g. plotting (hva)n (n= ½ or 2 for indirect or direct semiconductor; hv = excitation energy, a = absorption coefficient, proportional to the Kubelka-Munk transform in the relevant wavelength range) vs. energy and obtaining the corresponding intersection of the linear fit with the baseline [6]. Photoluminescence spectra were measured at room temperature on a Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer LS50B). Scanning transmission microscopy (SEM) studies were carried out in a JSM 6335 F microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (HTEM) and X-ray energy dispersive spectra (XEDS) were recorded on a JEOL 2100 F TEM/STEM microscope. Particle size distributions of the noble metal were obtained counting more than 150 particles in all cases. XPS data were recorded on 4 × 4 mm2 pellets, 0.5 mm thick, prepared by slightly pressing the powered materials which were outgassed in the prechamber of the instrument at room temperature up to a pressure <2 × 10−8 Torr to remove chemisorbed water from their surfaces. The SPECS spectrometer main chamber, working at a pressure <10−9 Torr, was equipped with a PHOIBOS 150 multichannel hemispherical electron analyzer with a dual X-ray source working with Ag Kα (hν = 1486.2 eV) at 120 W, 20 mA using C 1s as energy reference for adventitious carbon (284.6 eV). Surface chemical compositions were estimated from XP-spectra, by calculating the integral of each peak after subtraction of the “S-shaped” Shirley-type background [61] using the appropriate experimental sensitivity factors and the CASA-XPS (version 2.3.15) software. Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectra (DRIFTS) were taken in a Bruker Vertex 80 FTIR spectrometer using a MCT detector and running under OPUS/IR software. The set-up consists of a praying mantis DRIFTS accessory (Harrick Scientific) and a reaction cell (HVC, Harrick Scientific). The reaction mixture was prepared by injecting 3000 ppm of methanol (≥99 %; Aldrich) into a wet (3:7 methanol, MeOH, to water ratio) N2 flow before entering the DRIFTS cell. Higher quantities of methanol provide a strong gas-phase IR signal which does not allow to obtain any information of the surface species. The DRIFTS spectra were collected in the range of 4000–600 cm−1 with a resolution of 2 cm−1, by averaging 10 scans over a total of 1.2 s. In DRIFTS experiments in-situ light excitation was carried out using 365 nm (20 nm half-width) radiation. Each sample, without any previous treatment, was subjected in a continuous mode (without modifying gas mixture) to a single, multi-step experiment which aims to test the: i) adsorption of the reactive mixture under dark conditions, ii) reaction mixture evolution under illumination conditions, and iii) subsequent stay at dark conditions. Spectra were taken after different exposure times to verify any evolution behavior."
4,Description of the reactor,"2.3 Description of the reactor Regarding photocatalytic measurements at liquid medium, they were carried out using a batch pyrex (cutting absorption edge at ca. 300 nm) reactor as depicted in Fig. S1 of the Supporting information section. The reactor contains a x:y (x:y going from 1:9 to 9:1 v/v) CH3OH/H2O mixture medium maintained at a constant temperature (20 ± 1 °C). The catalyst suspension (previously optimized at a 0.5 g L−1 concentration) was first degassed with an Ar stream for 15 min. Subsequently, the Ar flow was settled down to 10 mL min−1 and stabilized before reaction. Ar is used as carrier to displace reaction gases from the reactor to the detection system. The solution inside a reactor was irradiated using a Hg-Xe lamp (500 W) and dichroic filters (LOT Quantum Design) allowing exposure of the catalysis to the UV (280−400 nm) or Visible (420−680 nm) wavelength range. The reaction rates for hydrogen production were evaluated at 3 h from the start of the irradiation, where a pseudo-stationary situation is reached. The hydrogen rate was analyzed using an on-line Mass spectrometry (Onmistart 300)."
5,Calculation of quantum efficiency,"2.4 Calculation of quantum efficiency Quantum efficiency is defined, according to the IUPAC recommendation (58), as the ratio of the number of molecules reacting by the number of photon interacting with the sample (Eq. (1)). (1) η q ( % ) = 100 × 2 × r ( m o l m - 3 s - 1 ) < e a > ( E i n s t e i n m - 3 s - 1 ) This equation takes into account that the transfer of two electrons are required to reduce two protons and thus to produce one H2 molecule. The reaction rate of hydrogen production (r in Eq. (1)) is measured in the liquid phase reactors as detailed in the previous subsection. To determine the denominator, we obtain the solution of the radiative transfer equation (RTE) in the heterogeneous reactor [62]. As detailed in the supporting information section, this renders the so-called local volumetric rate of photon absorption; e a . In Eq. (1) we used the volume average values of the e a observable parameter. The RTE (Eq. (2)) measures the variation of intensity (associated to a beam of rays at wavelength λ in the direction of a solid angle vector , Ω _ ) through a direction of the space (s). (2) d I λ , Ω _ ( x _ ) d s = - κ λ I λ , Ω _ x _ - σ λ I λ , Ω _ x _ + σ λ 4 π ∫ Ω ' = 4 π p Ω _ ' → Ω _ I λ , Ω _ ' d Ω _ Where κ λ is the absorption coefficient; σ λ is the dispersion coefficient; and p Ω _ ' → Ω _ is the scattering phase measured with the Henyey and Greenstein phase function, as usually carried out for titania samples [63]. The optical properties of the materials under study are presented in Fig. S3 of the Supporting information section. These equations assume; (i) the emission radiation is negligible (at room temperature), and (ii) steady state condition during the photocatalytic processes. A summary of the mathematical procedure to calculate the denominator of Eq. (1) is presented in the supporting information section."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization results,"3.1 Characterization results XRD patterns for the ternary composite samples under study are displayed in Fig. 1 . The single semiconductor reference patterns (corresponding to anatase TiO2 PDF 21-1272; space group I41/amd; and hexagonal berndtite SnS2 PDF 83-1705; space group P/3m1) are presented in Fig. S4. The composite patterns are dominated by the presence of the anatase polymorph without any sign of the berndtite sulfide and the noble metal. A similar conclusion can be reached from the Raman spectra presented in Fig. 2 . The Raman spectrum of the bare anatase [64] displays peaks at ca. 143, 395, 515 and 636 cm−1 and dominates the spectral profile of the composite samples, without apparent detection of any sulfide signal which would be easily detected using the ca. 310 cm−1 contribution. Thus, the lack of corresponding XRD and Raman signals informs about the reasonable dispersion of the noble metal and sulfide components over the major oxide material. This is further analyzed below. Before it, we can comment that analysis of XRD profiles render an anatase primary particle size in the 11−12 nm range for the single oxide and composite samples (Table 1 ). The sulfide of the S reference sample presents a higher particle size approaching 21 nm. As summarized in Table 1, a parallel behavior to the primary particle size of anatase is observed for all morphological properties. The high surface area (ca. 120−130 m2 g−1) and pore volume (ca. 0.2 cm3 g−1) characteristic of the sample containing the bare oxide are essentially maintained in ternary composite samples, with a moderate decay (close to ca. 20 % in both observables) only detected for the sample having the higher sulfide loading, T-2S. The structural and morphological properties are thus dominated by the anatase major component of the ternary samples, with limited influence of the contact of such phase with the minor components, the noble metal and/or the sulfide. Further analysis of the noble metal and sulfide phases at ternary composite phases was performed using microscopy (SEM/TEM) and spectroscopic (XPS) tools. The SEM micrographs and XEDS analysis for all samples under study are presented in Fig. S5. In the SEM micrographs we can observe the microsized secondary particles typical of the anatase oxide prepared using the same synthesis procedure [65]. The XEDS maps showed the good dispersion achieved for the noble metal and sulfide components. Such dispersion is better described in the STEM study presented in Fig. 3 . The dark field images allow to observe easily the metallic particles. Round shaped particles corresponding to spherical (or nearly spherical) entities can be observed throughout the whole surface of the oxide. The size of the noble metal particles was analyzed from these micrographs and results present in Fig. S6 of the Supporting information section. The histograms showed a relatively narrow particle size distribution, with strong similarity among the ternary composite samples and also with the Pt/TiO2 reference. The average primary particle size of the particles goes from 3.9 to 4.3 nm in all cases. On the other hand, the contact of the metal and the sulfide is evident from the XEDS maps of Fig. 3. The zones of Pt nanoparticles accumulation correspond to zones where Sn is also present, although the sulfide spread more homogenously over the material(s) surface. Note that the ternary contact is clearly observed in the dark field TEM-XEDS detail views presented in Fig. 4 but is observed for all ternary composite materials as demonstrated by the microsized maps presented in Fig. S5 using SEM-XEDS. The interaction between the semiconductor components is analyzed in more detail in Fig. 4. First to mention is the development of the characteristic (sulfide) nanoplatelets with hexagonal geometry in the S reference sample. Fig. 4A provides visual evidence of the characteristic nanometric dimension of the nanoplatelets, with restricted growth along the [001] direction, showing the stacking of few layers (typically 10–15; with a characteristic length of ca. 10 nm) held together through van de Waals interactions [66]. On second place, Fig. 4 (panel B) analyzes the structural details of the contact between semiconductors. We can see the 0.59 nm fringe of the SnS2 (001) plane in close contact with the 0.35 nm fringe interval of the (101) anatase plane in the TiO2 component. This proofs that flat-lying sulfide nanoplatelets were interfaced through the (001) plane with the (101) plane of the oxide, reaching an efficient contact in the composite materials. The overall microscopy (SEM/TEM/XEDS) study would thus suggest the generation of a strong interfacial interaction between the semiconductor components as well as the presence of Pt nanoparticles near the sulfide entities. The physical proximity of the three components is thus a distinctive characteristic of the ternary system, which is expected to influence positively the functional properties. This is a property driven by the preparation procedure. In Fig. S7 we compare STEM-XEDS results for the (T-P)-S and (T-S)-P procedures. It is shown that the first promotes significantly the contact between the three phases present in the composite powders. The analysis of the minor (and major) phases present in ternary composite samples was completed with the help of XPS. As expected, the analysis of the Ti 2p signal (Fig. S8) in all samples provides the evidence of a Ti(IV) chemical state (Ti 2p3/2 binding energy peaking at 458.0 eV for all samples) characteristic of titania oxides [67]. No changes can be noted throughout the samples of the series. The Pt 4f contribution is presented in Fig. 5 and displays a maximum (4f7/2 peak) at ca. 70.8 ± 0.1 eV for all samples. As bulk metallic Pt has a 4f characteristic binding energy at 70.8 eV [22,67,68], a metallic state appears characteristic for all samples. The zero valent chemical state of the noble metal is in line with previous reports studying platinum deposition on titania where an inert atmosphere was utilized [22,24,69]. The XPS study also reveals information concerning the chemical state of Sn. The Sn 3d signal (the 3d5/2 contribution peaking at 484.8 ± 0.1 eV in all cases; see Fig. 6 ) lacks differences between the S reference sample and the ternary composites, indicating that the characteristic Sn(IV) oxidation state of the sulfide is shared by all samples. This agrees with the corresponding study of the S 2p doublet, presented in Fig. S9 of the Supporting information section. Within the ternary composite series, this S 2p contribution is only observed with enough signal to noise ratio for the T-2S sample. However, the spectrum does not show any significant difference with the S reference sample. So, the joint microscopy and XPS study clearly demonstrates the presence of metallic noble metal particles as well as SnS2 nanosheets with a chemical state indistinguishable from the bulk material. Further details of the minor phases can be obtained from the analysis of the XPS ratio between the chemical elements present in the samples. Moreover, in Fig. 7 we confronted XPS ratios from those obtained using chemical analysis (ICP-AES). Considering first the Pt/T (the Pt/TiO2 ratio, obtained from Pt and Ti data, which can be directly confronted with target values of the synthesis) ratio, we observed relatively similar XPS or ICP-AES ratios for all the samples. The molar ratios measured using ICP-AES corresponding to a loading of 0.80 to 0.96 wt. % of the noble metal, differing only modestly from the original target of 1 wt. %. The correlation plot with the same observable measured with XPS shows relative agreement. Essentially, the two Pt/Ti ratios are equal within experimental error, although the XPS observable values spread over a moderate range of values. The Sn/Ti molar ratio was also studied and included in Fig. 7. In this case, the chemical analysis ratio values are rather close to target (synthesis values) ones. The correlation between XPS and chemical analysis observables render a behavior with a linear trend (as a first approximation). The linear trend indicates that the agglomeration of sulfide entities occurs without significant differences along the samples of the series, and that the fraction of the anatase surface covered by the sulfide is essentially proportional to the real content of the semiconductor in the ternary composite material(s). To end the physico-chemical characterization, Fig. 8 displays the UV–vis spectra of the samples. They show relatively similar UV spectra dominated by the major anatase component for all ternary composite samples. Thus considering that the anatase phase is an indirect gap semiconductor [70], we calculated the band gap values presented in Table 1. The values are rather similar between the catalysts, presenting an average value of 2.95 eV, characteristic of the main oxide (see Fig. S10). Note that the slightly lower value of the anatase-based powders (typical values are in the 3.0–3.2 eV range) can be associated with the presence of defects [6]. The noble metal component is not detected by any signal or contribution to the UV–vis spectra as the surface plasmon resonances in Pt cases do not usually render discrete peaks in the UV–vis spectrum due to the damping effect caused by d-d intraband transitions [4,6]. Contrarily to the noble metal case, the UV–vis spectra do have also a broad feature in the visible region directly ascribable to the sulfide component. Only very small differences are observed between the T-xS samples. Finally, we can mention that (according to the band gap values and the measurement of the valence band using XPS) the valence and conduction band positions of the ternary materials do not show differences (within experimental error) with respect to the single oxide reference system. This agrees with the rather similar structural, morphological and chemical properties displayed by the ternary samples and the mentioned T reference system."
8,Photoactivity: measurement and interpretation,"3.2 Photoactivity: measurement and interpretation A first point to discuss concerning the functional properties of the solids would be the effect of the relative distribution of the components in the catalysts. More concretely, we first analyzed the influence of the noble metal initial deposition on the oxide, sulfide or in both. Fig. 9 A provides the information that demonstrates that initial contact of Pt with the oxide render the best results, independently of the sulfide component concentration. The characterization results showed that this configuration favors the close contact of the noble metal with both the oxide and the sulfide semiconductors. It appears that the presence of Pt when the sulfide is introduced in the catalyst formulation helps to nucleate sulfide in zones where Pt is already deposited. This fact clearly indicates a beneficial effect coming from the close contact between all three phases in the ternary system. Fig. S11 also shows that the use of thioacetamide facilitates the nanoplatelet morphology of the sulfide and improves significantly activity. Loss of ca. 40 % of activity is detected in absence of the component facilitating the morphological structuration of the sulfide and contact with the rest of components. Also, the resulting material does not improve the activity of the T reference sample (single oxide sample). This proves again the mentioned efficient contact with the other components achieved in our catalyst(s), a fact crucial to promote activity. Using thus the most active configuration of the ternary system, Fig. 9B plots the reaction rate behavior through the series of ternary composite samples under UV and visible illumination conditions. In both cases the activity of the ternary phases increases the one of the single oxide reference (T) for sulfide contents about 1 (visible) and 1.5 (UV) mol. % content. High activity is observed in the 0.25−1 mol. % range, with the T-0.5S sample increasing the activity of the T reference by 1.4/1.9 factor for UV/visible illumination. The S reference is not included in Fig. 9B as it has a reaction rate inferior by more than one order of magnitude. Fig. 9C illustrates the catalytic behavior as a function of the methanol to water ratio for the T and T-0.5S powders. The stability of the photoactivity of both samples versus the liquid phase composition is noteworthy in both cases, as usually Pt/TiO2 samples display low activity either at low or high methanol:water ratios [22,29,71,72]. Maximum rates are here obtained for methanol:water ratios equal or above 30:70. We also tested the stability of the T-0.5S sample under long time on stream periods. Fig. S12 plots results from 4 consecutive cycles for a total of ca. 85 h under reaction conditions. As evidenced, the stability of the most active system is remarkable. The concomitant gas-phase CO2 production follows the generation of hydrogen while O2 is essentially not produced under reaction conditions (Fig. S13). This indicates that the reaction mechanism takes place through the reforming of the sacrificial molecule (methanol) with little addition from water splitting. The mechanism is further analyzed below. To provide a more quantitative comparison among the samples of our series, we calculated the true quantum efficiency of the photoproduction of hydrogen. Fig. 9D collects the quantum efficiency values calculated under all illumination conditions tested in this work. Values of 6.2/4.1 % are obtained for the T-0.5S sample under UV/visible illumination. These values increase the ones of the T reference sample by 2.1 (UV) and 2.8 (visible) times. The relatively higher enhancement factor obtained under visible light is likely related to the relative (with respect to UV illumination) low efficiency of the T reference as well as the changes observed in the optical properties triggered by the SnS2 presence in the ternary system (see Fig. S3). Also, the T-0.5S sample showed a calculated quantum efficiency value under a AM1.5 solar standard of 4.3 %. This value exceeds by far the ones previously reported for Pt (and other noble metal like Pd and Rh) promoted titania and carbon nitride based materials, which were in the 1.1–3.5 % interval [24,29,65,73,74]. The comparison with literature reports would thus proof the suitability of the ternary system for the effective profit of solar light. Aiming to interpreting the photoactivity of the samples, we combined the analysis of the charge carrier species fate using photoluminescence with an in-situ (under illumination) analysis of the reaction using infrared spectroscopy. Photoluminescence response of the powders was subjected to analysis under UV (330 nm) and visible (425 nm) excitation. Fig. 10 displays the results for both illumination conditions. The figure includes the bare anatase response as it dominates the spectral profile of all samples. Under UV, bare anatase shows rather broad peaks coming mostly from the annihilation of free electron/holes with localized (defect-related states) holes/electrons [75]. The presence of Pt significantly decreases the signal. The noble metal – semiconductor interaction is known to facilitate separation of charge and resulting in the acute photoluminescence intensity decay here detected [76]. It can be noted that the additional presence of the sulfide in the ternary composite catalysts further decreased the intensity. The photoluminescence spectra under visible (425 nm) illumination are also displayed in Fig. 10 and show the typical relatively weak signals associated to defect state(s) de-excitation over a decay curve corresponding to the excitation line [77]. These defects states are also dominated by the major component, titania, and the presence of Pt and/or the sulfide decrease the corresponding photoluminescence intensity. So, both components would be beneficial for charge handling and de-excitation, and this can be connected with the result of the characterization indicating the close presence of the noble metal to both semiconductors. As illustrated in Scheme 1 , in this configuration, Pt can collect electrons coming from both semiconductors and thus facilitate charge separation irrespective of the UV or visible illumination condition, providing a firm ground for the good functional properties of the materials for sunlight illumination. To further progress in the interpretation of the photoactivity, Figs. 11 and 12 depict infrared spectra for the T reference and the most active T-0.5S material, respectively. Results for the T-2S catalysts are presented in Fig. S14 of the Supporting information section. These figures display results under UV illumination conditions and contain plots concerning difference spectra taking as background the first spectrum recorded at initial dark conditions or under reaction and consisting in a sequential: i) adsorption of methanol in presence of water vapor, ii) reaction mixture (methanol:water) under illumination conditions, and iii) subsequent stay at dark conditions under the same reactive mixture used in previous steps of the experiment. Samples were pre-treated only with a nitrogen flow (10 min) prior to IR measurements. Rather similar results to Figs. 11 and 12 were obtained under visible light illumination (results not shown). Adsorption of methanol at dark conditions generates surface methanol and methoxy species (spectra presented in the upper chart of Figs. 11–12). In all cases studied, methanol (C–H contributions at 2952/2842 cm−1) seems to have larger intensity than methoxy (2922/2828 cm−1) species [22,78,79]. This is concomitantly observed with a weak decrease of isolated hydroxyl of titania at ca. 3700−3650 cm−1 as well as a more strong decreasing of the water (and interacting hydroxyl radicals) signals at ca. 3650−3200 and 1636 cm−1 (see Fig. S14 for the water region). CO stretching bands for the two (methanol/methoxy) adsorbate species appear around 1033 cm−1 but the bands are so broad and weak that cannot be easily resolved (Fig. S15). The methanol/methoxy peaks suffer an important decrease for the T-0.5S sample under reaction conditions with no changes (or small increase of intensity) for the rest of the samples. The different behavior of the methanol/methoxy species can be directly correlated with activity (Fig. 9). In fact, all samples (T, Fig. 11, T-0.5S, Fig. 12, and T-2S, Fig. S14) generate CO2 as the main product detected by infrared. The gas-phase branches of the molecule at 2350/2341 cm−1 are visible in all samples, with intensity roughly proportional to the activity. Thus methanol/methoxyl species evolve in the surface of the materials and finally render CO2. The most efficient surface chemistry of the T-0.5S for activating the initial (methanol-related) species is thus directly linked with activity. This demonstrates that surface chemical differences among samples makes a critical impact on photoactivity. To further understand the evolution of the methanol-related species we note that additional broad peaks in the ca. 1500−1000 cm−1 region are indicative of the formation of other species coming from the oxidation of the carbon containing sacrificial molecule (Fig. S15). In particular, for the T sample the 1521/1414 cm−1 contributions can be ascribed to bridged bonded carboxylates (mostly formate species). Carboxylates and or carbonates appear as the dominant species contributing to the infrared signal(s) in this region [22,77,78]. For the T-0.5S sample we observed a different adsorbed species, likely hydrogen carbonates, with contributions at 1623/1450 cm−1 [22,77,78,80]. These differences between the two samples occur concomitantly with difference towards water (region around 1650 cm−1). The presence of the sulfide component seems to create a more hydrophobic surface facilitating the oxidation of the methanol derived fragments. In addition and exclusively for the T sample, we detected the presence of carbonyl species over metallic Pt. This species is associated with bands at 2057 and 2031 cm−1 [22,24,81]. It is important to note that the characteristic carbonyl species over titania (ca. 2175−2120 cm−1; see Ref. [82] are not observed in Figs. 11, 12 and S14, nor for the support alone under reaction (result not shown). The characteristic frequencies observed indicate that CO sticks on the noble metal particle (see results after reaction in Fig. 11) and this may poison a fraction of the Pt surface. In summary, the study can be rationalized with a step-way transformation of methanol dominated by the chemistry of the titania surface (CH3OH +2 h+ → CH2O + 2H+; CH2O + H2O + 2h+ → HCOOH + 2H+; HCOOH +2 h+ → CO2 + 2 H+), with the protons produced in each step generating hydrogen with a primary role of the noble metal surface (2H++ 2e− → H2). This mechanism has been shown previously to occur in many Pt promoted titania-based materials [10,11,22,26,83]. In the absence of the sulfide component, it appears that carboxylate species evolve forming carbon monoxide, HCOOH → CO + OH− + H+ (2 TiOH). This reaction occurs in thermal catalysis and is likely promoted under light in specific systems [84]. This reaction would be followed by the water gas shift type reaction, generating hydrogen (CO + H2O → ⟵ CO2 + H2) as carbon monoxide is not detected at the outlet of the reactor for the T catalyst nor for any sample. Noteworthy, the presence of the sulfide modifies drastically the nature of the carboxylates/carbonates at the catalyst surface (Fig. S15) and completely eliminates the generation of CO. It thus appears that the presence of the second semiconductor opens a way which transforms rather efficiently the oxidized carbon species to CO2 (HyCOx + y h+ → CO2 + y H+; with x = 2; for x>2 participation of support defects is envisaged HyCOx + Ti-□ + y h+ → CO2 + Ti-O + y H+) via the preferential formation of hydrogen carbonates and direct transformation to carbon dioxide (see Scheme 1). There is no hint of other carbon-containing species working at reaction conditions in the corresponding infrared spectra of any T-xS sample. Thus, it can be concluded that activity differences in the presence of the sulphide species can be connected with the efficient chemistry to transform the initial methanol/methoxyl species in highly reactive surface intermediates in the way to carbon dioxide. Summarizing, as illustrated in Scheme 1, the unique properties of the SnS2 nanosheet-type component lead to a significant improvement of photoactvity in the Pt-TiO2-SnS2 ternary system, a fact not observed when the sulfide losses its laminar type morphology. As can be seen in the scheme, the noble metal and sulfide components act as real co-catalysts, with specific reaction steps taking place selectively in each one. The combination of semiconductors with adequate band gap energies (Table 1) is rather effective to use both UV and visible photons and to efficiently separate charge carriers due to the close presence of the noble metal to both semiconductors. So, simultaneous optimization of optoelectronic (charge recombination as measured by photoluminescence) and chemical (different carbon-containing species formed from sacrificial methanol, according to infrared) leads to the development of outstanding functional properties under UV and visible illumination components as rigorously measured using the (true) quantum efficiency parameter. It can be thus concluded that the Pt-TiO2-SnS2 ternary system shows the most fruitful (4.3 % quantum efficiency) use of the solar light to hydrogen conversion reported to date."
9,Conclusions,"In this work we prepared a Pt-SnS2-TiO2 ternary system, active in the hydrogen photoproduction through alcohol reforming. The analysis of the contact between the major anatase component and the minor noble metal zerovalent nanoparticles and the berndtite SnS2 nanoplatelets indicates than an intimate (or close) contact between the noble metal and the two semiconductors provides the basis for an optimum profit under both UV and visible light illumination conditions. Nanosized Pt particles and SnS2 platelets decorating the anatase surface have rather homogeneous physico-chemical (structural, morphological, electronic) properties along the T-xS samples. The measurement of the quantum efficiency demonstrates that an optimized ternary system (T-0.5S) overperforms the parent T reference by 2.1 (UV) and 2.8 (visible) times, rendering a catalysts presenting a 4.3 % quantum efficiency under sunlight illumination. This is the highest value reported so far for this reaction. To interpret the excellent performance of this material, we analyzed the charge carrier fate as well as the surface chemistry under reaction conditions. The close contact of the noble metal to both semiconductors allows to efficiency handle charge carriers under both UV and visible illumination, providing electrons to the noble metal from the two semiconductors and facilitating charge separation irrespective of the wavelength of the illumination in the UV–vis range. The study also uncovers that the ternary system has a singular chemistry under reaction conditions which plays a critical role controlling photoactivity. The activation of the carbon-containing methanol molecule is more efficiently carried out than in the single oxide (Pt/TiO2) T reference material, and is directly connected with the way the carboxylate/carbonate type species are handled by the surface interaction among the components of the ternary material. The infrared study demonstrates a step-like reforming transformation of methanol ending with carbon dioxide production and with the concomitant formation of hydrogen. Therefore, the fruitful combination of the electronic and chemical properties of the unique ternary system leads to promoting photoactivity performance to an outstanding level under sunlight illumination conditions."
