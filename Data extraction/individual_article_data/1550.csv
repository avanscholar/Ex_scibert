0,Introduction,"Anaerobic digestion is a microbial process that converts organic matter into biogas containing methane, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. Biodegradable organic materials such as manure, food processing waste, grease, municipal solid waste, and green waste can be effectively converted into renewable fuel without generating the negative externalities associated with many other bioconversion technologies. These externalities include strain on soil and water resources, competition with food crops for arable land, and increased greenhouse gas emissions as farmers worldwide expand production to fill a newly created grain supply deficit [1,2]. Recognition of the importance of anaerobic digesters has led to the development of a pilot scale anaerobic phased solids (APS) digester at the University of California, Davis [3]. The APS digester is a two-stage system. Initial feedstock solubilization, acidogenesis, and hydrogen production occur primarily in hydrolysis reactors, which are physically separated from a second stage methanogenic reactor. A simplified schematic of a two-stage digester is seen in Fig. 1 . Hydrogen generated during primary fermentation in the pilot plant's first stage hydrolysis reactors has been measured as high as 30% (ICC, unpublished data). With modification, the headspace of hydrolysis reactors can be isolated, allowing biogas with high hydrogen content to be selectively collected from individual reactors. The objective of this study was to evaluate alternative methods for enhancing biological hydrogen production in first-stage hydrolysis reactors."
1,Anaerobic ecology,"The mechanisms of anaerobic decomposition leading to hydrogen and methane production are complex, and significant work has been completed to elucidate the microbial populations involved and their catabolic machinery [4]. Polysaccharides, fats, and proteins are first solublized into monomers by extracellular enzymes. Monomers are fermented to acetate, hydrogen and carbon dioxide; or to the central intermediates, fatty acids, alcohols, lactate, and succinate; and the flow of carbon through these pathways depends on hydrogen concentrations [5]. Acetogens use the central intermediates to produce acetate, formate, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Syntrophic methanogens keep acetate and hydrogen levels from accumulating and inhibiting fermentation [5,6]. A simplified diagram of these processes in a batch reactor is shown in Fig. 2 . Low hydrogen concentrations maintained by methanogenic hydrogen scavengers are a key requirement for the thermodynamic feasibility of many fermentations. The metabolic co-dependence is so important that cultivation of Methanobacillus omeliansii, an organism that initially appeared to be capable of oxidizing ethanol to methane, was later isolated as two distinct species, a fermenter and a methanogen, in syntrophy [7]. A group of microbes called homoacetogens are also involved in hydrogen scavengering. Homoacetogens span 20 genera (over 100 species) and are defined by their ability to fix carbon dioxide to acetate via the acetyl-CoA pathway [8]. The standard free energy change of hydrogen oxidation is less favorable for homoacetogens than for methanogens, Δ G o ′ = −104.6 kJ/mol vs. −135 kJ/mol, but homoacetogens still play a roll in removing hydrogen in some conditions, especially when methanogenesis is inhibited [5,8]."
2,Biological hydrogen production: Metabolic and thermodynamic considerations,"Fundamentally, microbes share a key requirement: they must reoxidize nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) in order to regenerate the NAD+ needed for catabolic reactions. In Clostridium acetobutylicum, the 2 NADH formed during glycolysis can be regenerated through different metabolic pathways to acetate, lactate and butyrate; and to acetone, ethanol and butanol when acetate and butyrate levels increase [9]. NAD+ may be regenerated through a NADH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase/hydrogenase pathway to yield hydrogen. If 2 NAD+ is regenerated using this pathway, cells no longer need to use the ethanol, lactate or butyrate pathways; it is possible to ferment to acetate and generate additional ATP. Hydrogen can also be produced in a Ferredoxin:hydrogenase reaction as pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA, but this does not regenerate NAD+ [5,10]. Both hydrogen evolving pathways are thermodynamically sensitive to hydrogen. At 37 °C and pH 7, the hydrogen partial pressure above which the NADH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase/hydrogenase pathway is no longer favorable can be calculated from the Nernst equation assuming that the concentrations of NAD+ and NADH are equal: H 2 = exp ( n F R T ( E H 2 ′ − E N A D H ′ ) ) = 0.085 kPa (8.4 × 10−4 atm). For the ferredoxin:hydrogenase reaction: H 2 = exp ( n F R T ( E H 2 ′ − E F d ′ ) ) = 2.43, 35.5, 456 kPa (0.024, 0.35, 4.5 atm) for three different species of Clostridium (see Table 1 ). This calculation highlights the sensitivity of fermentation to hydrogen partial pressure and underscores the importance of interspecies hydrogen transfer to the thermodynamic feasibility of many fermentations [11]. It is also clear that calculated partial pressures are dependent on the redox potential of the catalyzing enzyme, which is organism specific."
3,Methods for increasing hydrogen yield,
4,Hydrogen partial pressures,"4.1 Hydrogen partial pressures In addition to theoretical considerations, there is empirical evidence that hydrogen concentrations influence both hydrogen production and fermentation products. The presence of hydrogen scavengers has been shown to change fermentation products and improve efficiency [12–14]. Bryant et al. [7] reported that 0.5 atm hydrogen partial pressure in the headspace of a methanogen - fermenter co-culture was enough to inhibit the fermenter. Chung [15] found that removing hydrogen gas from the headspace of cultures of Clostridium cellobioparum decreased the lag time, increased optical density, and resulted in greater glucose utilization and hydrogen production. Inhibitory effects of hydrogen were not observed on Escherichia coli and Bacteroides ruminicola, two organisms that do not generate hydrogen. Yerushalmi et al. [16] reported that butanol and ethanol fermentation from a pure culture of C. acetobutylicum increased as hydrogen partial pressures increased, and that the overall hydrogen production dropped by 30%. When Lamed et al. [17] increased the hydrogen partial pressure in the headspace of a C. thermocellum culture to 2.5 atm, the fermentation shifted toward ethanol production. Logan et al. [18] found that keeping reactor headspace pressures low using a gas respirometer to measure gas production led to 43% more hydrogen production than when the intermittent gas release method was used. Continuous reactors vacuumed to 0.28 atm by Kataoka et al. [19] on Clostridium butyricum's strain SC-E1 did not increase hydrogen yields. Vaccuuming has the advantage of also removing CO 2, a substrate for autotrophic homoacetogens, which decreases hydrogen oxidation by these organisms. However, because the study used a non-acetogenic strain, such an effect could not be evaluated. Removing CO 2 from the headspace of a mixed cultures using the chemical scavenger KOH did show such an effect. In a study by Park et al. [20], KOH placed in small vessels in batch reactors removed CO 2 over the course of the experiment and significantly impacted homoacetogen activity. This was apparent by monitoring hydrogen consumption after gas production had plateaued. With no CO 2 removal, both CO 2 and H 2 levels sharply decreased and acetate concentrations increased from 425 mg L−1 to 1140 mg L−1. When CO 2 was removed by the KOH, negligible hydrogen was consumed. Consequently, an interesting paradox exists for researchers working to enhance biological hydrogen production. The hydrogen utilizers that allow primary and secondary fermentation to be energetically favorable are the same microbes that decrease hydrogen yields. A method designed to solely inhibit hydrogen utilization will leave concentrations too high for efficient fermentation. An effective method of enhancing hydrogen should both remove it from the liquid phase and inhibit oxidation by methanogens and homoacetogens."
5,Mixing,"4.2 Mixing Despite its low solubility, concentrations of hydrogen in digesters have been measured at “40–70 times higher than values calculated using headspace hydrogen pressures and Henry's Law” [21]. This implies that mass transfer limitations occur in anaerobic digesters. Mixing is a possible option to expedite the release of hydrogen from the liquid phase, and there is evidence of its effectiveness. When pure cultures of C. thermocellum were grown on cellobiose and cellulose at 0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 rpm, acetate/ethanol ratios and hydrogen production were greater at faster stir rates. As headspace hydrogen pressure exceeded 1 and 2.5 atm for cellulose and cellobiose grown cultures, respectively, mixing no longer had an effect [17]."
6,Heat treatment,"4.3 Heat treatment Heat treatment has been used to select for spore-forming hydrogen producers in experiments on biological hydrogen production. The process kills methanogens that are not capable of sporulation, but does not eliminate homoacetogens [22]. Successful startup of hydrogen reactors with heat treated inolculum have been widely reported [23–28], but based on work by Zhu and Béland [29], and Kawagoshi et al. [30], heat treatment is unnecessary to successfully startup a hydrogen producing reactor. As Kraemer and Bagley [31] note, only a few studies have systematically compared the effect of heat treatment on hydrogen yield, and studies that have included heat treatment as factor in their experimental designs reported mixed results. Heat treatment requires an additional energy input with unclear benefits."
7,pH control,"4.4 pH control Chemical control of pH has been effective at inhibiting growth of methanogens with optimal hydrogen production occurring in the range of pH 5–6 [25,32–34]. Some studies found that hydrogen production ceased below pH 5 [29,30], while other studies indicate that the threshold is slightly lower ( ≈ 4.5) [32,33,35]. It is also possible to control pH with high substrate loading. Such an approach, leading to the accumulation of volatile fatty acids and a drop in pH, has been used to inhibit methanogens and has the advantage of not requiring additional chemicals [29,36]."
8,Gas sparging,"4.5 Gas sparging Sparging with gas has been successfully used to remove hydrogen from the liquid phase of bioreactors. The effect of sparging with N 2, CO 2 or recirculated biogas at rates of 100, 200, 300 and 400 ml min−1 was studied in a 5 L CSTR at fixed pH (hydraulic retention time 12, pH 5.3) [24]. Sparging with N 2 and CO 2 increased the specific hydrogen production rate and final yield. The highest yield of 1.68 mol H 2 per mol of hexose occurred with CO 2 at 300 ml min−1. Significantly less acetate was produced in the CO 2 sparged reactors. If the CSTR contained a pure culture, this shift in fermentation products away from acetate would contradict the hypothesis that higher hydrogen yields accompany acetate production. However, 16S rRNA analysis of the microbial community showed that carbon dioxide sparging inhibited homoacetogens, resulting in lower acetate concentrations and less hydrogen consumption. Research by van Andel et al. [37] on pure cultures of C. butyricum sparged with N 2 and CO 2 demonstrated the expected effect on acetate/butyrate ratios. Differences between these results and those reported by Kim et al. are most likely a result of homoacetogen activity. At large scale digesters, CO 2 may be available onsite as a byproduct of biogas purification, but additional pH control is required due to the acidity of this gas. Hussy et al. [23] examined the effect of sparging with N 2 on hydrogen production in a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) digesting a byproduct of the wheat flour industry. An increase from 1.3 to 1.9 mol hydrogen per mole hexose was achieved by sparging. Mizuno et al. [38] also reported increased yields from a mixed culture grown on glucose in a CSTR sparged with N 2. The steady state yield of 0.85 increased to 1.43 (mole H 2) (mole glucose)−1 during sparging, although no major shift in fermentation products occurred. Sparging with an inert gas like argon or nitrogen at a large scale may be prohibitively costly. Sparging industrial size reactors is feasible when the sparging gas is produced onsite. If the sparging gas is the same composition as the headspace gas, this technique is simply another form of mixing."
9,Hydraulic retention time,"4.6 Hydraulic retention time In continuous reactors, hydrogen consumption can be inhibited by using a short HRT to washout slower growing methanogens and homoacetogens. Chen et al. [39] found that using an HRT of 8 h in a CSTR fed sucrose, populations of Clostridium pasteurianum were maintained while methanogens were lost. Below an HRT of 6 h, complete washout occurred. Lin and Chang [40] also used HRT to control the microbial ecology in a continuous reactor fed glucose, achieving a maximum hydrogen production rate at an HRT of 6 h. Ueno et al. [41] ran a chemostat with a mixed microbial community fed sugary wastewater with HRTs of 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 days and achieved steadily increasing hydrogen production as HRT was reduced, and negligible methane production at the lowest HRT. Reactors with low HRTs are less suitable for digesting recalcitrant substrates that need longer reaction times to biodegrade. Of the methods for increasing hydrogen production reviewed above, pH control via substrate loading, control of headspace pressure, and mixing were the most appropriate at the APS Digester facility. For this reason, laboratory experiments were conducted to understand the effect of vacuuming reactor headspace and mixing on biohydrogen production in batch reactors at high substrate loading."
10,Materials and methods,
11,Experimental design,"5.1 Experimental design A two factor (mixing and headspace pressure) factorial experimental design could not be used because only three low flow gas meters were available to measure biogas production in the laboratory. A series of experiments, conducted one after another, were needed to obtain the desired number of replicates. A split plot design was employed with mixing as the main plot effect and pressure as the subplot effect. Both mixing and pressure were fixed variables. Bottles were either continuously mixed or not mixed and pressure was set in three control ranges: 60 ± 0.5 kPa, 80 ± 0.5 kPa, and 100 ± 0.5 kPa. The effect of inoculum storage time was not discounted, and a time block was included in the model. The ANOVA model for the split plot experimental design is y i j k = μ + ρ i + α j + δ i j + β k + ( α β ) j k + ε i j k , where: y i j k is the dependent variable, μ is the overall mean; ρ i is the blocking variable - time; α j is the main plot effect - mixing; δ i j is the main plot error, mutually exclusive of ε i j k ; β k the subplot effect - pressure; ( α β ) j k is the mainplot/subplot interaction; and ε i j k is the experimental error. Three time blocks, each containing two separate three bottle batch reactors were completed for a total of 18 batch experiments. Within each block, three of the reactors were mixed, and three were not mixed. It was assumed that 2 days of extra storage between tests within a block at had no effect on the activity of the microbial inoculum (i.e., there was no in-block variability). SAS statistical software's (SAS version 9.0, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) mixed procedure (proc mixed) was used to determine if mixing, pressure and the blocking variable had a significant effect on dependent variables. The mixed procedure only requires that the data be normally distributed, and this condition was met for all dependent variables. Heterogeneous variances, non-independent error terms, and missing data are handled by proc mixed, making it a robust data analysis tool."
12,Feedstock and innoculum,"5.2 Feedstock and innoculum Non-fat powered milk (Nestle Carnation; 2.5% moisture, 0.8% fat, 36.2% protein, 52% carbohydrate, 7.9% ash) was chosen as the substrate because it contains a mix of carbohydrates and proteins. Previous research indicates that sufficient nitrogen is a requirement for hydrogen production [42]. Mesophilic inoculum was obtained from a primary mesophilic digester (City of Davis Wastewater Treatment Plant, Davis, California). The sludge was filtered twice with a 1 mm mesh screen into a 15 L carboy, purged for 10 min with argon, and placed in a mesophilic incubator at 35 ± 1C. The sludge was allowed to stabilize for five days at which time no further biogas production was observed and it was removed from the incubator. After stabilization, the inoculum was anaerobically divided into six, 1 L bottles and placed into a refrigerator at 4 °C. Gravimetric analysis, run in triplicate, was used to determine moisture content (MC), total solids (TS) and volatile solids (VS) of the inoculum and substrate according to standard methods [43]. The results of this analysis are displayed in Table 2 ."
13,Batch reactor setup,"5.3 Batch reactor setup To start a batch reactor, inoculum was placed into 1 L bottles at a loading of 1 gVS L−1 working volume. The bottles were loaded with non-fat powdered milk at 4 gVS L−1 to achieve a food-to-microorganism ratio (F/M) of 4 and tap water was added to bring the working volume of the reactors to 500 ml. Previous experiments showed that this loading and F/M ratio quickly created low pH conditions [36]. Mixing was achieved with a magnetic stir bar at 500 rpm. Batch reactors were fitted with butyl rubber stoppers and tube adapters and connected to a control and measurement system, described below, with plastic tubing (Tygon R-3603, Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics, Paris, France). Reactors were placed into a mesophilic incubator at 35 ± 1 °C. The location of each reactor inside the incubator was randomized to account for any temperature discrepancies."
14,"Pressure control, filtering, and gas metering","5.4 Pressure control, filtering, and gas metering Three pressure control and gas measurement systems (Fig. 3 ) were constructed as follows. An acrylic pressure measurement chamber fitted with an absolute pressure sensor (US300, Measurement Specialties, Hampton, Virginia) was connected to a one-way valve followed by a sulfur filter, moisture filter, peristaltic pump and gas meter. Hydrogen sulfide filters were used to protect the gas meter's sensors and were constructed using acrylic columns packed with H 2 S removal media (SulfaTreat, SulfaTreat LLC, Bakersfield, CA). Moisture filters (Sodium Sulfate Moisture Trap, Alltech, Deerfield IL) were used to ensure that only dry gas was measured. Pressure controllers, designed and built for the project, monitored absolute pressure in the pressure measurement chambers and activated peristaltic pumps (Masterflex Easy Load, Cole Palmer, Vernon Hills, Illinois) to maintain digester headspace pressures within the desired range. The pressure controllers were built using 8-bit microcontrollers (PIC 16F867, Microchip Technology Inc, Chandler, Arizona) programmed in Assembly language. Pumps were directly connected to low flow gas meters that recorded the volume of gas produced. Leak tests were performed to ensure that each setup could hold a vacuum to 40 kPa for 24 h. Pressure data were constantly logged throughout an experiment to be sure that successful pressure control was achieved in all experiments. Prior to each test, reactors and control/measurement systems were purged with argon to create anaerobic conditions, the pressure controllers were activated, and the reactors were vacuumed to their set pressure."
15,Data collection,"5.5 Data collection Volumetric biogas production was measured with biogas meters described previously [44]. Volumetric gas production is reported at STP (273 K, 100 kPa). Methane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen were measured with a gas chromatograph (Agilent GC6890 N) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and packed column (Alltech C-9000) of length 3.05 m, outside diameter 3.18 mm, internal diameter 2.16 mm and with 80/100 mesh carbosphere. The carrier gas was argon at a flow rate of 29.8 ml/min. The injector, oven, and detector temperatures were 120 °C, 100 °C and 120 °C, respectively. Biogas samples were drawn directly from reactors and transported for injection into the gas chromatograph using a locking syringe. Volumetric hydrogen and methane gas production was calculated by multiplying the total biogas production by their respective percentages. This was accomplished by linearly interpolating biogas composition data, which was measured every 4 h and was therefore lower resolution than the biogas production data. The pH measurements were taken at the start and the end of each experiment. Concentrations of acetate, butyrate, iso-butyrate, propionate, valerate, ethanol, and methanol were measured using a gas chromatograph (Agilent GC6890 N) equipped with a flame ionized detector (FID) and column (Agilent J & W DB-Wax) of length 30 m with inner diameter of 0.32 mm and a film thickness of 1 μm. The carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 57.6 ml/min. The inlet and detector temperatures were 170 °C and 275 °C, respectively. The oven temperature started at 40 °C, ramped to 65 °C by 1 min, and reached 160 °C by 13 min."
16,Nonlinear regression analysis,"5.6 Nonlinear regression analysis In order to compare the cumulative production data statistically, total biogas, hydrogen and methane production time series plots were curve fitted with Matlab's nlinfit function (Matlab 2008b, The MathWorks, Inc. Natick, MA). The Gompertz equation used by other researchers did not fit the data well. Van Ginkel et al. [25] also had trouble fitting some biogas production data with the Gompertz model. A modified logistic growth equation, V ( t ) = Y / 1 + exp [ 4 / R Y ( λ − t ) + 2 ] , was used to estimate yield, maximum rate, and lag, where: V is the cumulative biogas production (ml gVS−1), Y is the biogas yield (ml gVS−1), R is the maximum biogas production rate (ml gVS−1 h−1), λ is the lag time (hr), and t is the reaction time (hr) [45]. This equation is a re-parameterization of a logistic growth equation to produce fitting parameters with biological significance. The shape of the logistic equation is not changed by this modification [45]."
17,Statistical analysis,"5.7 Statistical analysis Curve fitting parameters; acetate/butyrate ratio; acetate, butyrate, and ethanol concentrations; and change in pH, were used as the dependent variable data in the split plot analysis. An outlier analysis was completed by calculating studentized residuals. One experimental unit (block 3, mixed, 80 kPa) had studentized residuals approaching 3 for most of the dependent variables and was removed from subsequent analysis. This outlier had the largest drop in pH (3.08) and the lowest final pH (4.28), which presumably inhibited microbial activity and stunted biogas generation."
18,Results,"The subfactor pressure did not have a significant effect on any of the dependent variables, except methane yield. However, a multiple comparison test (SAS lsmeans method) found that 80 kPa was significantly different from 60 to 100 Kpa, but 60 kPa was not different from 100 kPa. Lower methane yields in 80 kPa were likely a false positive, type I error. Consequently, pressure was not believed to impact any of the dependent variables, and was removed as a variable in the statistical model. All data presented in the text have been averaged over pressure, but the complete statistical analysis that included pressure data is available in the supplemental information (Tables S1–S3). Cumulative production of moisture-free total biogas, hydrogen, and methane over the course of 34 h is displayed in Fig. 4 . Visual inspection of this graph immediately suggested that mixing increased both total and hydrogen yield and biogas production rate, and decreased lag time. Estimates of yield, rate, and lag obtained from the nonlinear regression of these data are displayed in Table 3 . Statistical results in Table 5 confirmed that differences between mixed and unmixed reactors were significant. It was expected that mixing would increase the gas production rate and decrease lag due to enhanced substrate availability. Mixing significantly increased total biogas rate (R) from 20.9 to 67.8 ml gVS−1 h−1 (p = 0.015), and a decreasing trend in total biogas lag ( λ ) from 11.5 to 8.1 h was observed (p = 0.087). Mixing significantly increased hydrogen rate from 9.0 to 30.8 ml gVS−1 h−1 (p = 0.022), and significantly decreased hydrogen lag from 12.9 to 9.0 h (p = 0.036). However, mixing significantly decreased methane production rate from 1.5 to 0.8 ml gVS−1 h−1 (p = 0.016), and decreased methane lag from 10.6 to 7.1 h (p = 0.054). Mixing increased total biogas yield (Y) from 219.9 to 292.16 ml gVS−1 (p = 0.006), increased hydrogen yield from 87.5 to 121.4 ml gVS−1(p = 0.056), but significantly decreased methane yield from 10.9 to 2.7 ml gVS−1 (p = 0.014). Changes in fermentation products accompanied increased yields (Table 4). When reactors were mixed, the average final acetate concentration increased from 312.3 mg L−1 to 426.4 mg L−1 (p = 0.12), the average final butyrate concentration decreased from 703 to 628 mg L−1 (p = 0.080), and the average acetate to butyrate ratio increased from 0.44 to 0.68 (p = 0.11). Despite not reaching statistical significance at α = 0.05 , these results do provide support for the theory that changes in dissolved hydrogen concentrations (achieved by mixing) shifted acetate-butyrate fermentation toward acetate. Ethanol concentrations were not affected by mixing (p = 0.24). A blocking variable was added to the ANOVA model to account for the effect of inoculum storage time because each successive block used inoculum that had been stored at 4 °C for slightly longer. The block was significant for total biogas yield (p = 0.048), which decreased with storage time and for ethanol concentration (p = 0.034), which increased in both mixed (22.3 to 129.9 mg L−1) and not-mixed reactors (48.5 to 125.4 mg L−1). The significance of the block effect for total biogas yield and ethanol reinforces the importance of its inclusion in the ANOVA model."
19,Discussion,"Vacuuming reactor headspace did not change gas production or fermentation products. It is possible that lower headspace pressure did not provide enough of a driving force to remove hydrogen from the liquid, or that the partial pressures reached were not low enough to significantly alter the thermodynamics of hydrogen evolving enzymes. Mixing, however, increased total biogas and hydrogen yields significantly. Increased substrate availability alone should not change yield because the substrate is ultimately converted into products regardless of an extended lag or slower rate. There are several explanations for the enhanced hydrogen in mixed reactors. In unmixed reactors, a blanket of gas bubbles at the liquid–gas interface was observed, impairing mass transfer, supersaturating the liquid with hydrogen and possibly lowering the spontaneity of hydrogen production [21]. Following the theory presented earlier, butyrate fermentation is favored under such conditions. Indeed, butyrate concentrations were 703 mg L−1 compared to 628 mg L−1 in mixed reactors. In unmixed reactors, entrained hydrogen provides an abundant energy source for methanogens. Increased hydrogen recovery in mixed reactors is likely a result of releasing entrained hydrogen, and therefore decreasing hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. This is supported by calculated corrections of hydrogen production assuming that methane came from hydrogen oxidation. Using the stoichiometry of this reaction: 4 H 2 + C O 2 → C H 4 + 2 H 2 O , if all the methane is converted back into hydrogen, there is no longer a difference between hydrogen yields in mixed and unmixed reactors (p = 0.91). During normal anaerobic decomposition, acetoclastic methanogenesis is responsible for the majority of methane production, although the exact proportion varies in different environmental conditions [46–48]. If it is assumed that 30% of the methane was produced from hydrogen, then the difference in hydrogen yields between mixed and unmixed reactors is still no longer significant (p = 0.13), supporting a greater role of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in unmixed reactors. The accumulation of hydrogen in the liquid and its release by mixing has been previously shown to influence hydrogen yields and fermentation products in pure culture studies [17,49]. This work extends the conclusions of those studies in the context of a mixed microbial community. In mixed reactors, the average headspace hydrogen content was 40% compared to 31% in unmixed reactors. These changes in gas composition explain increases in total volumetric gas yields because, assuming the ideal gas law, 4 mol of hydrogen at a given pressure occupy a larger volume than 1 mol of methane. In addition to releasing entrained hydrogen from the liquid phase, mixing may have accelerated acid formation, leading to a faster drop in pH and quicker methanogen inhibition. Early methanogen inhibition could also explain lower hydrogen consumption. pH was not measured continuously during the batch tests so it is unclear how pH changed over time, but there was no significant difference in final pH between mixed and non-mixed reactors. Final ethanol concentrations increased with each successive batch experiment. One explanation for an increase in ethanol is that inoculum storage selected for ethanol fermentation by changing the microbial community. This hypothesis requires additional experiments to confirm, but may be an interesting approach for targeting ethanol fermentation in mixed cultures."
20,Conclusions,"Low headspace pressure and vigorous mixing were evaluated based on their abilities to increase biogas production and shift fermentation products. Reactor headspace pressure, at the levels achieved (60, 80, 100 ± 0.5 kPa), did not have a significant effect on gas production, or on fermentation products. This result is consistent with a previous study [19]. Mixing had a significant effect on total biogas, hydrogen and methane production. For total biogas and hydrogen production, yields increased, lag times decreased, and maximum rates increased when reactors were mixed. Increases in rate and decreases in lag can be attributed to improved substrate availability, but increased hydrogen yields are most likely a result of a shift in the fermentation pathway and decreased hydrogenotrophic methanogensis. This work shows how high substrate loading and mixing can be used to effectively increase hydrogen production and produce biogas with up to 40% hydrogen. Large scale, two-phase anaerobic digesters can utilize rapid mixing following feeding to improve hydrogen generation. The results of this study provide evidence that acetate formation is favored in well mixed conditions, which will enhance methane production in second stage, methanogenic reactors."
