0,Introduction,"Among all the valences of nitrogen, the corresponding to three electrons makes it a versatile element in order to produce attractive compounds with most of the periodic table elements, mainly metals [1]. The bonding between nitrogen and a less electronegative element, such as a transition metal, produces very stable compounds, such as metal nitrides. In their comparative analysis between nitride and oxide compounds, C. Giordano et al. report richer bonding for the former, with more electron density found around the covalent bonds compared to the electrons located in the anion lattice. This characteristic is due to the superior electronic and optical properties of nitrides [2]. These properties, in addition to its thermal stability, make GaN an excellent candidate for some photonic applications, high temperature and high power devices [3], and, more recently, for hydrogen production [4,5]. While various physical methods can be used to prepare GaN, such as chemical vapor deposition [6,7], molecular beam epitaxy [8], and magnetron sputtering followed by an ammonia reaction [9], these routes are not designed for the mass production of GaN. While the nitridation method using Ga2O3 as a precursor in an NH3 atmosphere at 950°C [10] is one of the most common chemical routes for the production of GaN, the gallium precursor has recently been changed to GaAs and GaOOH [11]. However, over the past few years, this research group and other researchers have proposed the solvothermal route as a good alternative for the mass production of GaN nanoparticles due to its low cost, low environmental impact and attractive physical-chemical characteristics [4,12–14]. Collado et al. reported the synthesis of GaN microcrystallites by solvothermal method using high pressures of ammonia (100–200MPa) and high temperatures of synthesis (400–800°C) but their research only focuses in the luminescence properties of the synthesized GaN [12]. On the other hand, some reports regarding the solvothermal synthesis of GaN only synthesizes the gallium oxide by this method and the incorporation of nitrogen is carried out by additional ammonia treatment at high temperatures. Bao et al. reported the synthesis of GaN nanoparticles with spherical shape at 800°C in ammonia atmosphere using Ga2O3 synthesized by solvothermal method as precursor their reported that GaN converts directly from Ga2O3 preserving the skeleton of the oxide. This report only discusses the luminescence properties of the synthesized GaN [13]. More recently, our research group reported the use of different solvents during the synthesis of GaN being benzene the best solvent to crystallize wurtzite GaN, this work also report the use of GaN for the water splitting reaction [4]. This year, D. Kumar et al. reported the magnetic properties of GaN nanocrystals synthesized by the solvothermal method at 240°C during 3h. They used Ga2Cl4 dissolved in toluene and hexamethyldisiliazane as gallium and nitrogen precursors respectively [14], they obtained pure GaN which exhibits diamagnetic behavior. Since different morphologies of the nitrides have showed remarkable differences in their properties [1,2], the optimization in the physical chemical properties of this metal nitride obtained by the solvothermal route against the nitridation method can be questionable particularly because the interaction of the reagents in each route is different, carrying out the formation of undesirable phases, vacancies, etc. which results in strong signals in the photoluminescence spectra [15]. Until recently, a comparison study of GaN synthesized by different chemical methods have not been reported. In addition, in the last decade the scientific interest to synthesize nanoparticles of GaN have been increased because its potential as semiconductor to produce energy [16,17]. Since 2006, different authors have reported the use of oxynitrides for this purpose [18,19] increasing the photocatalytic activity in the production of hydrogen up to 1mmolh−1. However, the engineering of materials requires stablished methodologies to guarantee the reproducibility in the physicochemical properties of synthesized nanomaterials based in their fundamentals [20]. In addition, in our understanding there is only few reports regarding with the application of GaN for hydrogen production via electrochemical process [4]. Thus, this study is based on a comparative study of the properties of GaN prepared via two different chemical methods (nitridation with NH3 and the solvothermal route) in order to identify the advantages of each method for the final nitride in the production of hydrogen."
1,Experiment,
2,Synthesis of GaN with the nitridation method,"2.1 Synthesis of GaN with the nitridation method Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) (99.99%, Sigma-Adrich Co.) and ammonia (NH3) (99.0%, Infra) were used as sources of Ga and N, respectively. Ga2O3 was weighed and then milled in agate mortar for 30min. The oxide was then put into a quartz cell and placed in the furnace. Before the thermal treatment, the system was purged with Argon for 30min. Finally, NH3 was introduced into the furnace through a bypass system at a flow rate of 7.7L/h, with the thermal treatment commencing at a heating rate of 5°C/min until reaching a temperature of 900°C, which was maintained for 12h. Once the thermal treatment had been completed, the sample was cooled to room temperature in an argon atmosphere and then removed from the cell for physical-chemical characterization."
3,Synthesis of GaN via the solvothermal method,"2.2 Synthesis of GaN via the solvothermal method The solvothermal synthesis of GaN was carried out as reported previously by this research group [4]. Gallium acetylacetonate (99.99% Sigma-Aldrich Co.) and ammonium acetate (98% Sigma-Aldrich Co.) were used as Ga and N precursors in stoichiometric ratios. Benzene was used as solvent in a volume ratio of 9:1 with isopropyl alcohol (99.98%, OmniSolv, VWR Int). Ammonium acetate was mixed with 20mL of the solvent solution to obtain a 0.6M solution and heated on a hot plate at 50°C. The pH was then adjusted to 2 using HNO3 (DEQ, SA de CV). Once the ammonium had been completely dissolved, 30mL of gallium acetylacetonate was added, and the solution stirred for 24h. Once stirring had been completed, the solution was placed into a Parr hydrothermal reactor at 240°C for 72h. The reactor was then left to cool to room temperature, after which the synthesized material was recovered and washed gently with acetone. Finally, the synthesized material was dried at 100°C for 12h. In order to increase crystallinity, the synthesized material was placed in a quartz cell coupled with a tubular oven under an N2 atmosphere and treated at 900°C for 12h."
4,Physicochemical characterization,"2.3 Physicochemical characterization The structural properties of GaN were evaluated by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku Miniflex II with Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.548Å). The crystallite size was calculated using the Scherrer equation as follows: t = k λ β cos θ Where t is the crystallite size, λ is the X-Ray wavelength (0.154nm for Cu kα), θ is the Bragg angle, β the pure integral of width of the reflection at half maximum height and k is the Scherrer constant (0.9). The chemical states of Ga and N were observed by X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) using an Intercovamex XPS 110 with Al Kα 1486.68eV radiation. In addition, the morphology and particle size of the nitrides were evaluated by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) using a JEOL JEM-2010F microscope. Photoluminescence Spectroscopy (PL) measurements were performed at room temperature and excited at 225nm with a photoluminescence spectrofluorometer using a Xenon lamp (Horiba, Ltd.). N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were carried out at −196°C. Before the analysis, the samples were degassed at 300°C for 1h. The surface area was obtained by N2 physisorption and calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method with a Quantachrome Instruments Auto-sorb 3B."
5,Electrochemical characterization,"2.4 Electrochemical characterization For the electrochemical analysis, three milligrams of GaN was dispersed in a liquid solution of 6µL Nafion solution (Aldrich, 5wt%), 60µL ethanol (DEQ, 99.6%) and 30µL deionized water. To promote the dispersion, the solution was placed in an ultrasonic bath for 60min. Finally, 30µL of the resulting solution was deposited over an ITO film (8-12Ω/sq and A=1.0cm2) and dried at room temperature for 40min, and a three-electrode standard electrochemical cell then employed. A carbon rod and calomel (SCE) electrode were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. A Na2SO4 (0.5M) solution was used as a supporting electrolyte. Prior to use, the solution was purged by argon for 5min. The i-E profiles were recorded in the interval between 0.0V and −1.0V using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at a scan rate of 5mV/s. The experiments were carried out in a VersaStat3 Potentiostat/Galvanostat."
6,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1 shows the XRD results for the GaN synthesized by the two different routes reported in this study. In accordance with the values reported in card number IJCDP-50-0792, the complete crystallization of wurtzite phase GaN is clearly observed in both cases, with Ga2O3 neither remaining nor forming. As GaN is well known to crystallize, depending on the thermodynamic conditions, in a wurtzite, blende or sodium chloride structure. From this, it can be assured the formation of the same crystal phase of GaN obtained with the two different methods used in this study, which also enables the comparison of the physical-chemical properties of GaN. A deep observation conducted by TEM revealed the formation of 0.2µm wide microfibers in the samples prepared by the nitridation method ( Fig. 2a). This fiber is formed by agglomerated GaN nanoparticles with a spherical shape and an average particle size of approximately 20nm. The inter-planar distance taken from an isolated particle of GaN shown in Fig. 2b is 0.275nm, which corresponds to the plane (100) of GaN wurtzite phase [2,6]. Fig. 2c shows agglomerates of GaN prepared by the solvothermal method, formed by spherical shaped particles of approximately 18nm. Calculations of crystallite size were carried out using Scherrer equation from results shown in Fig. 1. Table 1 shows the average crystallite size obtained from this method which agree well with results mentioned above obtained by TEM observations in Fig. 2a and c. Comparing the above results obtained we can suggest that the synthesized nanoparticles are single crystals with similar morphology as was previously reported by D. Kumar et al. [14]. In addition, Fig. 2d shows that the inter-planar distance of the spherical particles have a value of 0.26nm, which corresponds to the plane (002) of GaN wurtzite phase [2,6]. From these results, it is feasible to assume that there is no difference in the crystal structure, morphology and particle size of the GaN produced by both synthesis routes evaluated in this study. However, as can be seen in Table 1, the GaN particles prepared with the solvothermal method present a higher surface area (48m2/g) and pore volume than that prepared with the nitridation method (10m2/g). This difference in behavior can be attributed to the synthesis route, the solvothermal treatment can promote a better dispersion of particles decreasing the agglomerate sizes, as shown in Fig. 2. The chemical states of Ga and N in GaN for both synthesis methods were recorded by XPS. Fig. 3a shows the general spectrum of both samples, with two well defined peaks for N 1s. The first peak is observed at 397.8eV, corresponding to the N chemisorbed with N in GaN [21,22]. The second peak identified at 425eV is similar to the resonance observed for NH3 in the gas phase [23]. A further observation of the N peaks is shown in Fig. 3b. This figure shows two well defined peaks for both samples, a main peak of approximately 397.6eV and another above 400eV. The low energy peak occurs in accordance with previous reports on Ga-N bonding in wurtzite GaN [24,25], while the higher energy peak (>400eV) has been associated with the presence of interstitial N in different compounds such as NOX or NHX [22,26]. In the case of Ga in GaN, the peaks at 1144.7, 1118.7 108.7 and 20.3eV correspond to Ga 2p1/2, Ga 2p3/2, Ga 3p3/2 and Ga 2d, respectively, and are consistent with previous reports [2,9]. The thermal treatment in NH3 atmosphere mentioned above is also able to remove the chemisorbed oxygen and promote the formation of Ga vacancies on the surface, producing a displacement to lower binding energies for the sample synthesized by the nitridation method, as observed in Fig. 3c. While similar displacement has been previously reported for Ga 2p and attributed to the formation of Ga vacancies in GaN films [24] and Gallium vacancies produced by NiGa in GaN [27], intensive peaks are observable in the sample synthesized by the solvothermal method at 286.5 and 532.5eV, corresponding to the C 1s and O 1s respectively. The last peak can be attributed to the oxygen chemisorbed on the surface of the sample. This chemisorbed oxygen is confirmed in Fig. 3d, in which two peaks can be observed. The peak at 532.5eV is associated with the existence of C/O or OH- adsorbed species on the surface of GaN, which is reported at 531.7–532.5eV [28,29]. J. Du et al. have reported the thermal oxide film growth on GaN, demonstrating the formation of a new peak at approximately 530.5eV, which corresponds to the Ga-O in Ga2O3 [28] thus, eliminates the possibility of gallium oxide formation in this research due the absence of this peak. The lower intensity observed in Fig. 3d for the sample prepared with the nitridation method could be associated with the reductive NH3 thermal treatment mentioned above. A slight displacement to lower binding energies (531.7eV) is also observed in this sample, indicating the formation of different adsorbed oxygen species [29], as occurred with the solvothermal sample, while the peak at 536eV has been related to the N-O bonding in NOX compounds [30], confirming the results related to interstitial nitrogen, as shown in Fig. 3b. Finally, the use of an organic solvent, such as benzene, is likely to cause carbon traces, as shown in Fig. 3a for the solvothermal sample, in which a clear high intensity carbon peak can be seen. Adsorption-desorption isotherms are shown in Fig. 4a, showing a clear hysteresis for the sample synthesized by the solvothermal method with an H1 type loop at an approximate relative pressure of 0.8, which can be associated with capillary condensation and desorption in open ended cylindrical mesopores [31]. The existence of these open mesopores coincides with the higher surface area and pore volume values for this sample, as shown in Table 1. On the other hand, the sample synthesized by the nitridation method shows a lower volume and no hysteresis compared to the solvothermal sample. These results concur with prior expectations due to the absence of porosity observed in this sample, as seen in the pore size distribution shown in Fig. 4b. Two well-defined peaks are observed for the samples synthesized with the solvothermal method, thus confirming the existence of mesopores with an average pore diameter smaller than 60Å. While the samples synthesized by the nitridation method show a negligible pore volume below 100Å, the actual average pore diameter observed for this sample is approximately 300Å. It is worthy to mention that GaN nanoparticles obtained by both methods showed dark gray color which reduces the possibility to evaluate the optical properties by UV–Vis spectroscopy due the high absorption of these materials. For this reason photoluminescence spectroscopy was choose to evaluate the optical properties of our samples. Fig. 5 shows the PL spectra of the GaN synthesized by both methods studied in this research. Both spectra show two well-defined emission peaks as reported previously [27], with the GaN synthesized by the solvothermal method showing peaks of approximately 2.85 and 3.0eV, while the GaN synthesized by the nitridation method shows small shifts to 2.82 and 2.97eV, respectively. In addition, the last sample shows an increase in the emission band intensity compared to that obtained with the solvothermal method, which is caused by the defects in the GaN obtained by nitridation, as shown in Fig. 3. The absence of yellow luminescence (YL) (~2.25eV), which can only be seen in high conductivity GaN (N deficient) and disappears in semi-insulating GaN (N rich), should also be mentioned [32]. In addition, a change in the main peak between GaN samples is also observed, with the sample prepared by the nitridation method showing its main peak at a lower energy level (~2.8eV) than the sample synthesized by the solvothermal method, thus clearly showing a main peak at a higher energy level (~3eV). These results, the high intensity at a lower energy level (~2.8eV), the shift to 2.82eV compared to the solvothermal sample, and the absence of YL in the nitridation sample can all be related to the Ga vacancies and interstitial N produced during the thermal treatment in an NH3 atmosphere, as seen in Fig. 3 [4,33]. In particular, the origin of the 2.8eV band has previously been studied using Mg doped GaN [34], reporting that isolated MgGa functions as a deep donor, while the nearest neighbor to MgGa-VN functions as an acceptor and forms a donor-acceptor (DA) pair, which originates the band at 2.8eV. Analogously, in our research, exist interstitial N in the samples prepared by nitridation method (shown in Fig. 3) which could work as acceptor while Ga vacancies (also shown in Fig. 3) could work as deep donors forming the DA pairs which origins the band at ~2.8eV with high intensity. In accordance with the literature [35,36], GaN becomes semi-insulating due to the carbon occupation of both N and Ga lattice sites, with a band appearing at 3eV. This behavior could explain the high intensity peak at ~3eV recorded for the GaN prepared with the solvothermal method and, thus, concurs with the C peak observed in Fig. 3a. This luminescence band (~3eV) appears due to DA transitions from CGa to CN, as proposed previously by other authors [35]. An electrochemical analysis was used as a manner to put in evidence the comparative analysis of the application of GaN for the generation of hydrogen. A comparison of current versus the potential profile obtained from the cathodic linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) is shown in Fig. 6, profiles which could describe the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Both samples show a clear response in the faradaic current, which is higher than the bare ITO, thus indicating that both GaN samples effectively catalyze proton reduction. The potential at which the faradic current reaches 6mA requires 1000mV using bare ITO. In contrast, both samples showed higher current response at the same potential, with the sample prepared with the solvothermal method recording the best current response (15mA). These results are comparable with previous reports that used different electrodes for the same purpose [37,38]. Finally, considering the physical chemical characterization shown above, the better current response for the solvothermal sample can be attributed mainly to the carbon traces and also could be due the better textural properties related to the synthesis method. These results clearly show that the synthesis method for producing GaN plays an important role in the hydrogen evolution reaction."
7,Conclusions,"GaN nanoparticles with wurtzite phase were successfully obtained by two different methods (nitridation and solvothermal) at 900°C. While both methods presented agglomerates with various micrometers formed by GaN nanoparticles with similar particle size (~20nm), the solvothermal method promotes a higher surface area associated with the formation of mesopores and lower agglomerate sizes. The XPS results revealed the existence of Ga vacancies and interstitial nitrogen in the structure of the GaN prepared with the nitridation method, which is attributed to the thermal treatment under an NH3 atmosphere. The GaN obtained with the solvothermal method showed traces of carbon impurities, which are associated with the solvents used. The higher intensity PL emission for the GaN obtained by the nitridation method is associated with the formation of some defects, such as Ga vacancies and interstitial N. These defects are responsible for the low energy peaks at ~2.8eV in the PL results. In contrast, the sample prepared with the solvothermal method showed high intensity at ~3eV, which is related to the carbon traces that remained in the sample. Finally, while both samples show a potential application for hydrogen production, the latter sample showed a better response in terms of the current recorded during the hydrogen evolution reaction, indicating that this sample is superior in terms of the water splitting reaction mainly attributed to the carbon traces that this synthesis method provides the nitride. These results demonstrate that GaN prepared with chemical methods can be used for hydrogen production and that the synthesis method plays an important role in GaN activity."
