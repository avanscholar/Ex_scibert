0,Introduction,"The continuous use and depletion of fossil fuels, as well as the increase in population, present a considerable threat to the environment [1]. Furthermore, given the volatility of crude oil prices and the increasing emissions from industry and transportation, it is critical to develop a suitable fuel to substitute crude-based fuels. Hydrogen is considered the energy key for the future. Green hydrogen is one of the most promising and interesting energy carriers [2]. Because of its advantages such as high conversion efficiency, hydrogen is increasingly being used as a primary or secondary fuel in a variety of applications. The literature review reveals that recent interest in green hydrogen production has led to several research works around the subject. Studies in literature have investigated the different methods used for the production of hydrogen [3–6]. Dincer and Acar [7] discussed different techniques for generating hydrogen, including fossil fuel-based and renewable energies methods, in terms of economic and environmental factors, as well as social costs. The obtained results show that steam reforming of natural gas and coal gasification is the least costly methods for generating hydrogen. However, these methods produce tremendous quantities of contaminants compared to hydrogen production techniques based on renewables, such as thermochemical techniques, photo-electrochemical cells, and photovoltaic electrolysis. Some of the sustainable methods are not cost-effective. For example, the cost of generating hydrogen from photoelectrochemical cells is about 10 times greater than the cost of reforming natural gas [7]. The best method for the production of hydrogen is determined by a variety of factors such as cost, resource availability, and maturity [8]. The method by which hydrogen is produced determine whether hydrogen is a green energy carrier or not [9]. As a result, for sustainable green hydrogen production, only renewable energy sources should be taken into consideration [4,10]. Water electrolysis [11,12] is one of the most sustainable and promising hydrogen production method. A hydrogen-based economy, which is expected to emerge in 2038, is favorable because it will provide industries with great opportunities, resulting in the development of hundreds of jobs [13]. The first phase in a hydrogen economy transition is to analyze its potential in order to determine its feasibility. Several studies have evaluated the potential of hydrogen production from various energy resources in different regions. Authors in [14–17] examined the potential of hydrogen production from renewable energy in different countries including Sweden, Argentina, Venezuela, Hong Kong, and US, respectively. In Iran, Fereidooni et al. [18] assessed the production of hydrogen from solar. For this analysis, a PV plant with a capacity of 20 kW and an electrolyzer with a 90% efficiency were used. The findings have shown that 373 tonnes of hydrogen could be generated annually by this facility. The economic assessment of this project has shown that the project IRR is 6.6% and its payback period is 16.36 years [18]. Nematollahi et al. [19] analysed the potential of hydrogen production from renewables in Iran. It has been shown that it is possible to achieve a maximum production rate of hydrogen of about 39,700 kg per year. In the United States, Levene et al. [20] investigated the production of hydrogen from wind and solar using water electrolysis. The findings demonstrate that there is a lot of potential for hydrogen production from these latter sources in the United States, which may be used by fuel stations. In Hong Kong, Ni et al. [16] assessed the hydrogen production potential from renewable energies such as biomass, wind, and solar. They showed that energy produced from hydrogen can cover up to 40% of power consumption in the transportation industry. Posso and Zambrano [12] estimated hydrogen generation from renewable energies in Venezuela. The power generated by wind, solar, and mini-hydro was used for water electrolysis in their study. They demonstrated that the annual hydrogen production is predicted to reach 2.073 × 10 10 kg, with photovoltaics accounting for 95% of this amount. Posso et al. conducted a preliminary study of hydrogen production in Ecuador using renewable energy sources such as wind, solar PV, and geothermal [15]. The findings show that PEM electrolyzers may produce annually up to 4.55 × 10 8 kg of hydrogen. In Argentina, Rodriguez et al. [21] investigated the potential of using wind resources for the production of hydrogen. The investment cost per kW is critical in making the production of green hydrogen from water electrolysis competitive with other production methods [22]. Several studies investigated the economics of hydrogen production. Kalinci et al. [23] performed a techno-economic analysis of a stand-alone solar/wind/hydrogen system. Their work showed that the variability of solar radiation and wind speed have a high impact on the size of fuel cells and hydrogen storage systems. To maximize an on-grid PV/WT renewable energy system, authors in [24] used economic and environmental assessments. Experimental data for the target load, the atmospheric temperature, the wind speed, and the solar radiation were used to conduct this analysis. They observed that the optimal system yielded the lowest cost with the highest pollution using the economic objectives. Inversely, using the environmental objectives, the optimal system yielded the lowest emissions with the maximum cost. A techno-economic study of high temperature solid oxide electrolysis combined with CSP plant was conducted by Yadav and Banerjee [25]. The obtained results have demonstrated that this method may become competitive with fossil-fuel-based techniques until 2030. El-Emam and Ozcan [26] performed a techno-economic evaluation of various hydrogen production techniques. They found that the costs of generating hydrogen from solar-based hybrid sulfur cycle, and water electrolysis were in the range of 3.41–7.95 $/kg, and 6.21–12.6/kg, respectively. A feasibility study for the use of a solar PV with fuel cell and battery in off-grid energy system in Brazil, was performed by Silva et al. [27]. The result of the techno-economic optimization study has shown that the optimal system had an initial capital cost (ICC) of $872, an energy cost (EC) of $1.4/kWh, and a total net present cost (TNPC) of $1024. Simons and Bauer [28] conducted a life cycle analysis about the use of water electrolysis in the production of hydrogen. The findings have shown that wind electrolysis-related GHG emissions are 1.72 kg CO2 eq./kg H2. Siddiqui and Dincer [29] performed a comparative life cycle evaluation of coal gasification and SMR processes. The GHG emissions associated with coal gasification have been estimated as 23.7 kg CO2 eq./kg H2. Sanchez et al. [30] reached the lowest energy cost of about $0.55/kWh for the optimal configuration of off-grid power system involving WT/PV/WT/FC, while meeting the required energy demand for rural residential application. PV/WT/FC Hybrid system has been studied by Khalid et al. [31] with an aim to optimize the system. The findings showed that the EC was roughly $0.87/kWh. In addition, the surplus power produced by the hybrid system is fed to the electrolyser for the production of hydrogen. Isa et al. [32] determined the energy cost (EC) and the total net present cost (TNPC) of a power system consisting of PV/FC with Batteries used for hospital building as a cogeneration system in Malaysia. The obtained results have shown that EC is equal to 0.092 $/kWh while TNPC is $1071. The prices of hydrogen-based renewable energy systems (i.e. EL, WT, DG, PV, HT, and FC) vary from country to country, and the cost of these components are projected to decline on an annual basis. Furthermore, in literature, the total net present cost and energy cost of these systems differ. This change relies heavily on the economic legislation of the chosen country and the quality of renewable sources such as solar radiation. These profiles are distinct from site to site. In the literature review, various methodologies and targets were used to analyze hybrid clean energy based on hydrogen in different countries. Some of these studies have not been yet conducted in Morocco, while they are extremely important. The potential of green hydrogen production in Morocco is discussed in this work, as the kingdom is determined to spearhead the development of green technologies in Africa and the MENA regions. Morocco is committed, strongly and voluntarily, to international efforts to protect the climate and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in order to consolidate the principles of sustainability in the operation of public facilities and in economic, social, and development investments. Hydrogen has many potential uses aside from being an energy carrier, as it is heavily used in the metallurgy and fertilizer industries. Morocco has the largest reserve of phosphate in the world, approximately 70% of the total world reserves which are in the order of 50 billion tons [33]. This phosphate is used with ammonia to create fertilizers which are utilized in the field of agriculture. This country has an abundance of phosphate, while the ammonia used to make fertilizers comes from imports. Therefore, Morocco is very much interested in producing green hydrogen and consequently ammonia. Morocco's annual requirement for ammonia is around 1500,000 tonnes [33]. Hydrogen represents 17.65% of the mass of ammonia. Therefore, a production of 260,000 tonnes of hydrogen is annually required in order to meet the country's needs without having to import from abroad. It is important to perform an economic study to investigate whether the cost of producing green hydrogen is satisfactory and competitive with gray hydrogen. This is why this work seeks to find the best possible configuration for the production of green hydrogen at the lowest cost with renewable energies available in abundance in the kingdom. There are only very few studies about hydrogen production in Morocco. The current work has been performed to fill the gap in literature because of the lack of research work. To the best of our knowledge, the socioeconomic and political potential of hydrogen production from PV system in Morocco has not been done before. This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides a social and political assessment of hydrogen production in Morocco. This is followed by an overview of hydrogen production methods. In Section 4, the energetic mathematical model used to estimate solar PV and hydrogen production is described. An economic analysis was then performed to calculate the levelized cost of hydrogen production from solar and the levelized cost of energy. An environmental assessment to quantify CO2 emissions reduced by the use of hydrogen to fuel heavy-duty vehicles is presented in Section 5. The concluding remarks are provided in Section 6."
1,Socio-political assessment of hydrogen production,"Green hydrogen produced from water electrolyzes and renewable electricity will play a key role in a future decarbonized economy. In Morocco, a national hydrogen commission has been formed to strengthen the country renewable energy development policy, ensure energy independence, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The commission's mission is to lead and monitor the completion of hydrogen studies, as well as to review the implementation of the hydrogen production roadmap and its renewable energy derivatives. Indeed, the establishment of this commission is part of a larger effort to boost the kingdom's capacity in the technological development of the renewable energy sector, with the aim of making Morocco one of the world's leading green fuel producers and moving forward with the development of new energy partnerships with high added value. The implementation of such strategies will have a significant economic, social, and environmental impacts such as the development of the renewable electricity sector and the creation of new jobs in the country. With its ambitious energy transition policy and massive investments in renewable energy, Morocco is on track to become independent of foreign energy imports and significantly reduce electricity prices for consumers. The promise of green hydrogen and especially the economic prospects of its export will probably lead to a new boom in renewable energies in Morocco. At this stage, it is not very well known how the expected boom will affect Morocco's energy transition. At best, as many experts hope, the high demand and immense amount of renewable energy required for the production of green hydrogen will lead to rapid liberalization of the Moroccan electricity market, simply because the current centralized model will not be able to produce the necessary quantities of clean electricity under conditions of international competition. Hydrogen could thus become a gateway for private companies, municipalities, and households and thus further diversify the players in the Moroccan electricity market. However, things could also be different. The current structure of large solar power plants and wind farms, which today remain operated by only a few (semi-) state actors, could, according to the fears of some other experts, be further strengthened by the new direction of electricity or hydrogen production towards export. For it is likely that the future expansion of renewable energy will also be widely supported and subsidized by international donor funds. Funds that can only be absorbed by the state on this scale and invested only in large facilities of this kind. For both scenarios, however, the main question is who will have priority for the use of green electricity and hydrogen produced in the future in Morocco. The country already exports small amounts of electricity to Spain via an underwater cable. In order to avoid distortions of competition for Spanish companies participating in the European trade in certificates, Madrid is now pushing for the EU to levy a carbon tax on imports of electricity produced from coal. This might already mean that Morocco will only export its solar and wind energy and use more coal-fired energy for its internal needs. However, the export orientation should not be at the expense of the local population, otherwise, the energy transition would risk losing its legitimacy to the citizens. Morocco should therefore ensure that its population benefits first from the hydrogen boom and that the share of renewable energy in the national electricity mix is gradually increased. Although this would mean that Europe might have to wait a little longer for the first delivery of green hydrogen. In the future, the kingdom may become an energy exporter and, with the help of green hydrogen, give a boost to Europe's energy transition. But in the meantime, the country still has to overcome some obstacles and some seemingly contradictory goals. Europe will not be able to produce all of its renewable energy due to its population density and small size. Therefore, it is expected that a significant portion of hydrogen will be imported. Although, it may be imported from many locations across the globe with high solar and wind resources, a promising option is the import from Morocco. Solar and wind energy production costs in Morocco are much lower than in Europe. Electricity generation costs are expected to decline further to € 10–20 per MWh in North Africa by 2030 in regions with significant solar and wind resources [34]. Load factors of 4000–5000 h per year will be achieved with a combination of solar and wind, or even wind alone. The levelized cost of hydrogen generation will be around € 1 per kg with electrolyser efficiency of 80% and CAPEX of € 300 per kW [34]. In Europe, cost of hydrogen production is likely to be higher than in Morocco due to the higher energy generation costs for both solar and wind. In 2050, hydrogen production costs in North Africa will be substantially below € 1 per kg, due to the expected decrease in both electricity generation costs and system CAPEX, as well as the improved electrolyser efficiencies. As a result, Europe requires green hydrogen from North Africa, Morocco. Such an export/import program, however, necessitates enormous societal and political will between Europe and North Africa. To make the transition practicable and avoid excluding substantial segments of the current power industry, special consideration must be paid to reducing stranded assets and involving as many participants as possible. In order to benefit both continents, an investment environment must be created in mutual cooperation. The most important factors to consider while creating an action plan are: • A strong, explicit, and long-term political commitment is required, • An associated market design and an enabling regulatory environment is necessary for such investments, whilst maintaining the system costs affordable, • A policy framework for integrated electricity-hydrogen infrastructure and storage systems must be developed, with equitable access to energy for all. • The EU and Morocco must establish and implement a distinctive, and long-term mutual collaboration on social, political, and economic levels. Mutual respect and trust must underpin this collaboration, which should take into account each other's social, economic, and cultural backgrounds."
2,Hydrogen production methods,"Hydrogen is the first element of the periodic table, it is the least complex atom, the lightest, the oldest, and the most abundant element in the universe. However, it is very rare to find this element (especially dihydrogen H2) alone in nature. Therefore, it is necessary to isolate it to produce H2, because hydrogen tends to bind with other atoms. It has a single electron in its unique envelope, but this envelope will be saturated in the presence of two electrons. This means that hydrogen atom has a strong tendency to form bonds with other elements. This includes other atoms of the hydrogen itself (forming H2 molecules), and it also easily binds with oxygen, forming H2O (water) and carbon (forming the backbone of many organic chemicals, including proteins, fats, DNA, alcohol R-OH, CnHm oil, gasoline, ammonia NH3 and many other chemicals. Hydrogen has a very good mass per energy ratio which reaches 33 kWh / kg (i.e. ∼ 120 MJ / kg) compared to 12 kWh / kg (i.e. 44 MJ / kg) for diesel. This will allow it in the future to become one of the main energy vectors and forms of energy storage in the world. Indeed, many projects implementing these characteristics have already proved the great potential of hydrogen as an energy carrier. However, hydrogen has also some limitations such as its low density. This makes its storage one of the greatest obstacles to its development. Hydrogen has low specific energy in comparison with methane and gasoline. Increasing the density of hydrogen can partially overcome this problem. This can be performed using three different processes; each with its efficiency, advantages, and disadvantages. • The first solution is to use hydrogen to form toluene-methylcyclohexane (MCH or C7H14). This should take place at a temperature of 300 °C and 300 kPa of pressure. This type of treatment allows the storage of hydrogen in chemicals with a much greater density (770 kg / m3) for operation and transport. • The second method is the liquefaction of hydrogen. To transform hydrogen from its gaseous state to its liquid state, the temperature must reach −252.87 °C which is its condensation temperature under atmospheric pressure. Following this condensation, the density will increase up to ∼ 71 kg/m3. Hydrogen can also be compressed in its gaseous state to 700 bars to reach a density of 42 kg/m3. This compressed hydrogen is generally used to fuel hybrid cars. • The third solution is to inject hydrogen formed in a Haber-Bosch type reactor with nitrogen to create ammonia, which has a density of 0.73 kg/m3. This density can be improved by submerging the resulting ammonia into water (H2O). The reaction between its two elements will result in the creation of hydroxide (OH-) and ammonium (NH4) (Eq. (1)). (1) N H 3 + H 2 O → y i e l d s N H 4 + + O H − . The obtained ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) is a liquid that has a density of 880 kg/m3. Haber-Bosch is the main chemical process for ammonia production (NH3) today. This process has been developed at the beginning of the 20th century, by two German engineers Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch. The process converts nitrogen from the atmosphere to ammonia via a reaction with hydrogen (H2) and a metal catalyst under very high temperature and pressure conditions. This process is summarized in the following reaction (Eq. (2)). (2) N 2 + 3 H 2 → y i e l d s 2 N H 3 ."
3,Hydrogen production from biomass,"3.1 Hydrogen production from biomass 3.1.1 Biophotolysis The production of hydrogen using biophotolysis is based on the principle of photosynthesis. The metabolism of the organisms used is redirected towards the production of hydrogen instead of the synthesis of carbohydrates and the formation of biomass. A distinction is made between direct biophotolysis and indirect biophotolysis. In direct biophotolysis, water is directly converted, in the presence of solar energy, into hydrogen via photosynthetic reactions (Eq. (3)). (3) 2H2O + light → 2H2 + O2. This conversion is no longer possible except under well-defined operating conditions. This is because the enzyme used for the production of hydrogen (Fe-hydrogenase) is extremely sensitive to oxygen. Oxygen levels above 2% inhibit hydrogenase activity, which decreases hydrogen production. In indirect biophotolysis processes, the concerns of sensitivity of the hydrogen-producing enzyme to oxygen are bypassed by temporary and/or spatial separations of hydrogen and oxygen. In fact, during indirect biophotolysis processes, the production of hydrogen and oxygen is carried out in different stages. 3.1.2 Photo-fermentation Photosynthetic bacteria develop molecular hydrogen using light and a reducing compound through catalysis by nitrogenase in a nitrogen-free environment. These bacteria alone are not capable of breaking down water. Under anaerobic conditions, they are able to use an organic acid such as acetic acid as an electron donor. These electrons are transported to nitrogenase by ferrocene using energy from adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In the absence of nitrogen, this nitrogenase can reduce the proton (H +) to hydrogen gas using energy from ATP. The overall hydrogen reduction reaction is given by Eq. 4. (4) C6H12O6 + 6 H2O + ""light"" → 12 H2 + 6CO2. 3.1.3 Dark fermentation Unlike direct biophotolysis and photo-fermentation, anaerobic fermentation, also known as Dark Fermentation, does not require illumination to produce biohydrogen. Indeed, in the process of anaerobic fermentation, sugar is broken down by metabolic pathways into simpler organic acids and there is a parallel production of hydrogen by the body to oxidize the reducing elements during metabolism accumulation. The main advantage of anaerobic fermentation for the production of hydrogen is of course the fact that no source is needed. Therefore, the associated disadvantages do not pose any problem. In addition, several types of microorganisms are capable of producing hydrogen by anaerobic fermentation, in particular the Clostridiaceae and Enterobacteriaceae families as well as the non-taxonomic group of purple non-sulfur bacteria (BPNS)."
4,Hydrogen production by electrolysis,"3.2 Hydrogen production by electrolysis Until the 1950s, the electrolysis of water was used for the production of hydrogen and oxygen. Today, electrolysis provides only a small quantity of hydrogen in the world, which is supplied to applications that require small volumes of high purity hydrogen. From the point of view of the electrochemical reaction, it is the reverse reaction to that which takes place in a battery. The electrolytic cell is formed of two electrodes, a cathode and an anode, an electrolyte, and a current generator. The electrolyte is either a polymeric proton exchange membrane or an oxygen ion conductive ceramic membrane. In the case of a proton exchange membrane, the reactions are as follows: At the anode, electrons are formed following the oxidation of water into oxygen and protons (oxidation) (Eq. (5)). (5) H2O → 2H + + 2e− + (½)O2. At the cathode, the protons passed through the membrane, are reduced with the electrons to give hydrogen (reduction) (Eq. (6)). (6) 2H ++ 2e− → H2. Water is dissociated into hydrogen and oxygen. Since the enthalpy of water dissociation of is 285 kJ / mole, an input of electrical energy is necessarily required. Today, electrolysis is associated with the future use of renewable energies. This could be interesting given the non-simultaneity of production by these processes to meet the needs of industrials and individuals. In addition, the efficiency of electrolysis is in practice in the order of 65%; although theoretically, it is possible to reach 80 or 85%. The price of hydrogen produced by electrolysis is currently by far the most expensive. Eq. (7) gives the price of electrolytic hydrogen as a function of the price of electricity. (7) PH 2 ( $ / G J ) = 1.25 P E l e c t r i c i t y + 7.10 . For example, for an electricity price of $ 0.064 / kWh, the cost of hydrogen is $ 29.4 / GJ (electricity consumption equal to 52 kWh/kg of H2 taking into account the consumption of auxiliaries). On the other hand, for hydrogen produced by steam reforming of natural gas, the price is lower. Thus, in order to increase the economic profitability of the process, lower-cost electricity is needed. The coupling of electricity from renewables with electrolysis, wind /electrolysis or photovoltaic /electrolysis, or hydraulic/electrolysis, are alternative solutions. These alternatives are clean solutions without greenhouse gas or toxic emissions."
5,Hydrogen production from fossil fuels,"3.3 Hydrogen production from fossil fuels Currently, 96% of global hydrogen production comes from fossil resources. Indeed, the techniques of converting fossil fuels to produce hydrogen are today the most mature and the most economical methods. However, they could not be a long-term solution given the abiotic aspect of these fossil resources. They only constitute a medium-term solution. There are four processes of hydrogen production based on fossil fuels, namely: steam reforming, partial oxidation, autothermal reforming and carbon gasification. The three main stages involved in the production of hydrogen from fossil resources are: • Production of synthesis gas. • Conversion of carbon monoxide into hydrogen (Water Gas Shift). • Purification: obtaining high purity hydrogen. 3.3.1 Synthesis gas production Steam reforming Steam reforming consists of transforming light hydrocarbon feedstocks into synthesis gas (mixture of H2, CO, CO2, CH4 and H2O) by a catalytic reaction with water vapor. This transformation takes place at high temperature (800 to 1000 °C) and moderate pressure (of the order of 5 to 25 bar). It can be followed by various operations which lead to the production of hydrogen and synthetic fuel. The hydrocarbon load of a steam reforming unit can be natural gas, methane or even naphtha. The reaction is as follows (Eq. (8)). (8) Light hydrocarbons + Water vapor ↔ Synthesis gas . Currently, the technique of steam methane reforming (SMR) is most commonly used to produce hydrogen in bulk. It consists of regulating methane, the main constituent of natural gas, with water vapor to produce synthesis gas. However, in order not to poison the catalytic system, natural gas must generally be desulfurized before being sent to the reforming unit. The reactions taking place during methane reforming are as given in (Eq. (9)). (9) { C H 4 + H 2 O ↔ C O + 3 H 2 C O + H 2 O ↔ C O 2 + H 2 C H 4 + 2 H 2 O ↔ C O 2 + 4 H 2 . The overall reaction (Eq. (9)) is generally catalyzed by a nickel-based catalyst at temperatures ranging from 900 to 1200 °K and at pressures from 5 to 25 bars. At thermodynamic equilibrium, some methane does not react and is recycled into the process. The endothermic aspect of the overall methane reforming reaction requires a heat backup system. It is generally provided by an auxiliary combustion reaction (with recycled methane and, if necessary, make-up methane) serving to supply the reformer with heat by external means of heat exchange. Partial oxidation Partial Oxidation can be carried out on more or less heavy products ranging from natural gas to heavy residues, and even coal. From an economic point of view, the treatment of heavy loads is justified when the over-investment made is offset by a reduced cost of the raw material such as petroleum coke. At high temperature (1200 to 1500 °C) and high pressure (20 to 90 bar or more), in the presence of oxygen (air) as an oxidant, the partial oxidation of hydrocarbons leads (Eq. (10)), like steam reforming, to the production of synthesis gas. On the other hand, the reaction is exothermic and takes place (in general) without a catalyst. (10) Hydrocarbon charges + O x y g e n ( A i r ) ↔ S y n t h e s i s g a s . The system must operate in the absence of oxygen relative to the stoichiometry of the reaction so as not to induce complete combustion of the charge (formation of H2O and CO2). Partial oxidation of natural gas (mainly methane) is currently a well-mastered technique for the production of hydrogen. The reaction is given by Eq. 11: (11) C H 4 + α ( O 2 + 3.77 N 2 ) ↔ S y n t h e s i s g a s . Autothermal reforming Autothermal reforming is a combination of steam reforming and partial oxidation. The fuel is mixed with air and water. The partial oxidation being exothermic, there is a release of heat which is then used by steam reforming; an endothermic reaction (Eq. (12)). (12) Hydrocarbon charges + Oxygen ( A i r ) + Water vapor ↔ Synthesis gas In the case of autothermal reforming of methane, the overall reaction involved is given by Eq. 13. (13) CH4 + α (O2 + 3.77N2) + βH2O ↔ Synthesis. Coal gasification This technique was the main source of hydrogen production before reforming, but today it is only used in some countries such as South Africa and China. It is considered an interesting technique when the prices of oil and gas are too high. Its principle is based on mixing coal with water and air at 1000 °C and under high pressure, which results in a gas containing mostly CO and hydrogen. 3.3.2 Conversion of carbon monoxide into hydrogen Known as Water Gas Shift, the carbon monoxide conversion reaction (Eq. (14)) consists of the enrichment of synthesis gas with hydrogen. The conversion reaction is balanced as follows: (14) CO + H2O ↔ CO2 + H2. From a thermodynamic point of view, hydrogen production is an exothermic transformation favored at low temperatures (generally below 250 °C) and in the presence of excess water vapor. 3.3.3 Purification There exist several hydrogen purification methods such as low-temperature separation, amine separation, membrane separation, pressure swing adsorption (PSA), and other liquid solvent methods, as well as combined methods of membrane purification and pressure swing adsorption. The use of each process depends in a large part on the nature of the trace components in the synthesis gas which is subject to purification and the required hydrogen purity. The degree of hydrogen cleaning ranges from drying to complex purification."
6,Energetic and economic modeling of hydrogen production,"To tackle the challenges posed by the use of fossil fuels, alternative energy sources, such as solar energy, are now required. However, this latter energy source has inherent problems such as variability, uncertainty, and instability. Electrolyser, on the other hand, are conversion devices characterised by high dependability, and efficiency, as well as minimal emissions. The use of a solar field to power electrolyzers, which delivers fuel, offers many advantages (Fig. 1 ) [35]. The performance of solar PV and hydrogen production using photovoltaic-electrolysis can be compared as follow: • The exergy efficiency of PV panels varies with the intensity of solar radiation and ambient temperature, making it a significant metric for calculating the exergy efficiency of both the PV and the hydrogen production system. • The energy and exergy efficiencies of both systems increase with increasing solar radiation. • Both solar PV and hydrogen production systems using photovoltaic-electrolysis are environmentally friendly. • Because of the low PV efficiency, solar PV hydrogen production has a lower exergy efficiency as compared to other systems such as solar thermal hydrogen production system. • The sustainability rating is greater with higher exergy efficiency of the system. Therefore, a solar PV hydrogen production system has a lower sustainability index as compared to other systems such as solar thermal hydrogen production system. For a modular system simulation, each physical component of the proposed system is modeled as a separate element and Simulink blocks (Fig. 2 ). All of the blocks take into account both specific component characteristics and design factors. Simulink enables the development of hierarchical models. Each block can have other blocks within it [35, 36]."
7,Electrolyzer modeling,"4.1 Electrolyzer modeling An electrolyzer is an electrochemical device that breaks down water into hydrogen and oxygen using electrical electricity. It compromises several electrolyzer cells wired together in a series. 4.1.1 Cell current-voltage characteristic The current-voltage relationship is used to model the electrolyser electrode kinetics. Both the ohmic resistance and the overvoltage are critical factors in the I-V curve modeling [37]. (15) V = V r e v + r ′ A I + s ′ . L o g ( t ′ A I + 1 ) , where V and Vrev are the cell operation and reversible voltages, respectively. This latter is equal to 1.229 V at standard conditions. I is the cell current, and A the area of the electrode [37]. Resistance of electrolyte: (16) r ′ = r 1 + r 2 × T . Overvoltages on electordes: (17) { s ′ = r s 1 + s 2 × T + s 3 × T 2 t ′ = t 1 + t 2 / T + t 3 / T 2 , with T is the electrolyte temperature (K). 4.1.2 Hydrogen production The rate of hydrogen production in an electrolyser cell is proportional to the electrical current, according to Faraday's law. The total hydrogen production rate is expressed as: (18) n H 2 = η f × N c e l l × I n × F , where η f the Faraday efficiency; F Faraday's constant and is equal to 96,485. Ncells is the number of cells, and n is a constant (equal to 2). Faraday efficiency is the ratio between the actual and theoretical maximum amount of hydrogen generated by the electrolyzer. Assuming the electrolyzer's operating temperature is 40 °C, Faraday efficiency is given by Eq. (19) [38]: (19) η f = 96.5 × [ e 0.09 i e − 75.5 i e 2 ] The electrolyzer used in this study is Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM). The reason behind choosing this electrolyzer type is because of its high reactivity and efficient operation with renewable energies which are known by their intermittent energy generation [39]. The hydrogen mass produced by the system, is calculated on an hourly basis for the duration of 8760 h using Eq. 20. (20) H 2 m = E p v × η e l e c t r o l y z e r H H V H 2 . H 2 m is the mass of hydrogen produced in each hour in kg/h. E p v is the energy yielded by the PV power plant adjacent to the electrolyzer in kWh/h. η e l e c t r o l y z e r is the efficiency of the electrolyzer. In this study, the electrolyzer used has an efficiency of 80.04% and is estimated to consume 4,4 kWh/Nm3 of the produced hydrogen [40] . H H V H 2 is the higher heating value of Hydrogen, which is equal to 39,4 kWh/kg. The goal of this work is to estimate the hydrogen production of a 20 MW electrolyzer/20 MW PV systems. This study is based on evaluating the economic and environmental impacts of partially replacing fossil fuels by 350 bar compressed hydrogen as an energy vector used to fuel heavy duty trucks in certain cities of Morocco. The energy used to compress the hydrogen from 30 bar (pressure output of the used electrolyzer) to 350 bar is 1 kWh/kg. Therefore, the yearly hydrogen produced can be calculated using Eq. 21. (21) H 2 , 350 = E p v , y e a r F e l e c + F c . E p v , y e a r is the energy produced by the PV power plant per year in kWh/yr. F e l e c is the energy consumed by the electrolyzer to produce 1 kg of Hydrogen which is 48,94 kWh/kg. F c is the energy required to compress 1 kg of hydrogen from 30 bar to 350 bar."
8,Proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC),"4.2 Proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) The output voltage of a fuel cell represents its performance. The voltage of a single cell Ucell can be calculated using eq. (22) [41]: (22) U c e l l = E + η a c t + η o h m i c , Where E is the thermodynamic potential. ηohmic and ηact are ohmic overvoltage and the anode and cathode activation overvoltage. A Simulink model of the electrolyzer is developed using Eqs. (15)-(20), and is illustrated in Fig. 3 ."
9,PV modeling,"4.3 PV modeling 4.3.1 PV characteristic The relationship between the operation voltage V and the operation of current I of the equivalent circuit is defined using Eq. (23) [42]: (23) I = I L − I D − I s h = I L − I 0 { e x p ( V + I R S a ) − 1 } − V + I R S R s h , with IL, ID, Ish, I0 are the light, diode, shunt, and reverse current, respectively. a is the curve fitting factor. Rsh, and Rs are the shunt and series resistance. The power of the cell and array is expressed as: (24) P c e l l = V c e l l I c e l l , (25) P t o t = N s P c e l l , where Icell and Vcell are the cell current and voltage, respectively. NS is the number of cells in series. Operating the PV system at its maximum power point results in maximum produced power (Eq. (26)) [42]: (26) P m a x = V m a x I m a x = γ × V o c × I s c where Imax and Vmax are the current and voltage at maximum power point, and γ is the fill factor of the cell. Current production is proportional to solar irradiation. To account for temperature changes identified empirically, a small temperature coefficient which is in the order of a few milliamps per degree Celsius is considered. (27) I p h ( G , T ) = I S C × G a G a s + α s c T ( T − T s ) where G a is solar irradiance and G a s is solar irradiance at standard test conditions, T is the temperature of the cell while T s is the cell temperature at standard test conditions, and α s c T is the temperature coefficient of short-circuit current. Under given environmental circumstances, the open circuit voltage is expressed as: (28) V o c ( g , T ) = V o c s + β o c T ( T − T s ) + k T q ln ( I m p p I s c s ) where V o c s is the open-circuit voltage at standard test conditions, I m p p is the current at maximum power point, and β o c T is the temperature coefficient at open-circuit voltage. Under open circuit condition, the diode reverse saturation current is given by Eq. 29: (29) I s a t ( G , T ) = I p h ( G , T ) ⌊ e ( V o c ( T ) ) V t ( T ) − 1 ⌋ Thermal voltage (30) V t ( T ) = A k T q where k is Boltzman's Constant, and q is the electron charge. The cell efficiency (Eq. (31)) is a good measure of its performance. It is determined using, the incident of solar energy (GT), the energy produced (Pcell) as well as the cell area (Acell). (31) η = P c e l l A c e l l × G T . 4.3.2 PV production Through water splitting, hydrogen is obtained using the energy produced from a solar photovoltaic system. In this case study, the energy used by the electrolyzer is generated by 20 MW PV power plants. In each studied site, the power is determined using the proposed model. The resulting energy produced from the PV system is found using Eq. 32. (32) E p v = G h i * η p v * η c , where E p v is the energy generated by the PV power plant, η p v is the PV cell conversion efficiency of the module, η c is the percentage of energy lost due to DC power conversion and conditionning (transformer losses for example), the value of this power conditioning is estimated to be at around 95% [43]. G h i is the global horizontal irradiance of the studied site. This latter is generated from weather data software Meteonorm in TMY2 format. The aforementioned equations Eqs. (23)-(32) have been translated into the Simulink model shown in Fig. 4 . The model assumptions and inputs are presented in Table 1 ."
10,Economic analysis,"4.4 Economic analysis An economic study has been conducted after assessing the potential of electricity and hydrogen production in different cities in Morocco. To evaluate the economic feasibility of these green hydrogen production units, calculating the Levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and the Levelized cost of Hydrogen (LCOH) for each localization is required. These financial metrics are used to compare different energy sources in diverse regions. The LCOH of a green hydrogen project must be lower than 5$/kg in order to be attractive to potential investors [44] . The value of LCOH is closely linked to the LCOE, which is the levelized cost of electricity, as it constitutes a high percentage of the total LCOH. As renewable energies are constantly dropping in price, it is expected that green hydrogen will soon overtake CO2 emitting hydrogen processes. An estimation of the capital cost has been performed in the economic analysis. In addition, the different financial input parameters have been determined based on market analysis and literature review. The economic assessment enabled the calculation of the levelized cost of hydrogen production and the levelized cost of energy. The unit cost of hydrogen production is determined using Eq. 33. (33) L C O H = ∑ 1 N E x p ∑ 1 N P r o d . The numerator of this equation consists of all expenses and charges that are projected to be incurred by the project from the day of conception to the last day of service (during the lifetime of the project). These expenses are expressed as (Eq. (34)). (34) ∑ i = 1 N E x p = ∑ i = 1 N O & M ( 1 + r ) i + C a p E x . N is the duration of the project in years, which is usually equal to 20 years for renewable energy projects as well as green hydrogen projects. r is the discount factor which is generally around 6,4% for renewable energy projects in Morocco. O&M is the system cost of maintenance which includes the maintenance and the replacement costs projected for the Electrolyzer, the PV fields, and the 350 bar compressors. The CapEx is the initial investment of the project which is roughly equal to 1600 $/kW for the whole system according to current market prices [45]. The denominator of Eq. (27) is the levelized quantity of hydrogen produced throughout the project. In this work, it is quantified in kilograms (kg) in order to facilitate comparisons with current LCOH prices which are usually given in $/kg as well. This latter is calculated using Eq. 35. (35) ∑ 1 N P r o d = ∑ i = 1 N H 2 p r o d u c e d y e a r l y ( 1 + r ) i . The CapEx can be expressed by Eq. 36: (36) C a p E x = C a p E x E l e c t + C a p E x P V . where the C a p E x P V is given by (Eq. (37)) (37) C a p E x P V = C a p E x m o d u l e s + C a p E x B o P . The C a p E x E l e c t is calculated by (Eq. (38)). (38) C a p E x E l e c t = C a p E x S t a c k + C a p E x B o P + C a p E x c o m p . The OpEx is the cost of operation and maintenance projected throughout the project. It is given by Eq. 39. (39) ∑ i = 1 N O & M ( 1 + r ) i = ∑ i = 1 N O p E x P V ( 1 + r ) i + ∑ i = 1 N O p E x e l e c t r ( 1 + r ) i + ∑ i = 1 N O p E x c o m p ( 1 + r ) i . O p E x P V is the maintenance cost of the PV power plant, which constitutes 4% of the PV CapEx. O p E x e l e c t r is the maintenance cost of the electrolyzer which is equal to 4% of the electrolyser initial investment. O p E x c o m p is the maintenance cost of the compressor which is estimated to be at around 10% of the compressor CapEx [45]."
11,Results and discussion,"4.5 Results and discussion To determine the potential of electricity and hydrogen production in different cities in Morocco, solar irradiation data of each region are needed. A number of mathematical models are available in literature for the forecasting of solar radiation. This latter is used as input in our model to calculate the energy produced by the PV system. This produced electrical energy is then provided as input for the water electrolysis. Fig. 5 presents the hydrogen and electricity generation outputs per month for the different studied cities. As it can be shown, hydrogen production is inextricably linked to electricity generation. For both hydrogen and electricity, all sites have a common pattern. In the winter, the production of both hydrogen and electricity is at its lowest, steadily increasing through the spring until summer, when it reaches its peak. Then in the fall, this production declines once again. The highest production is achieved in July in most of the investigated regions, except for Dakhla which is characterized by more or less hot weather all year round. The lowest amount is reached during December for all the different locations. The region of Dakhla produces the most, with a total output of 996,083 kg/year. Tetouan region has the lowest amount, with a production of 891,798 kg/year. To investigate the impact of the solar PV panel orientation on the system performance, two case scenarios for the production of hydrogen have been simulated. The first one has been done with a PV system having a fixed panel orientation. The second one has been performed with a PV having a single axis solar tracking system. Fig. 6 . presents the hydrogen production yield of both scenarios. It is shown that for all the simulated sites, the hydrogen yield is higher for PV with 1 axis than for a standard PV. Fig. 7 presents the LCOH obtained for the two case scenarios. The findings show that the LCOH is higher for a PV with no tracking system. This is because the LCOH and the hydrogen yield have an inverse relationship. After comparing the LCOH and the hydrogen yield of both scenarios, it has been concluded that it is highly preferable to use solar tracking to make solar hydrogen production more economically viable. Therefore, the performance of hydrogen production system is influenced by a number of factors such as solar PV panel orientation, PV tracking system, or tilt angle. This has been validated experimentally by authors in [46]. The results obtained through this study are coherent with the current price indicators of green hydrogen production. The hydrogen production costs range from 5.27 $/kg to 5.96 $/kg as shown in Fig. 7 (PV with 1 axis). The lowest LCOH is obtained in Dakhla and Marrakech with PV having one axis solar tracking system. These latter cities have the best solar potential as compared to the other sites studied. On the other hand, Casablanca achieves the highest LCOH as compared to its counterparts. Cost division representing the different components of the studied system indicates that the electrolyzer system is the most expensive component of the whole system, as shown in Fig. 8 . The electrolyzer system in addition to its compressors and storage devices constitutes about 60% of the total capital expenditure of the project. The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) has been also calculated and compared to the LCOH. As shown in Fig. 9 , the LCOH is closely related to the LCOE. Cities with high energy yield such as Marrakech, Dakhla, and Agadir are the ones with the lowest LCOE and subsequently achieves the best LCOH. Casablanca is the city with the highest LCOE of 4.14 $cent/kWh and the highest LCOH of 5.96 $/kg; whereas both Dakhla and Marrakech achieved an LCOE of roughly 3.66 $cent/kWh and an LCOH of 5.27 $/kg. The LCOH and LCOE results can be further reduced if the state provides subsidies which could help greatly in reducing the CAPEX costs of the project. The impact of the provision of subsidies for funding low carbon hydrogen production has been also investigated in this work. Fig. 10 presents a comparison of LCOH for unsubsidised vs subsidised systems. Subsidies of 50% reduction in the CAPEX have been studied. The LCOH of Dakhla has decreased significantly and has become equal to 3.49 $/kg. Similarly, the LCOH of Casablanca has reached 3.95 $/kg. The findings demonstrate that the LCOH in all the studied cities has dropped by approximately 2 $ after receiving a 50% reduction of the project's capital expenditure as subsidies. Marrakech is the city that has benefitted the most from the installation of a solar tracking system (from an LCOH of 6.48 $/kg to one of 5.27 $/kg), as shown in Fig. 4. Its potential with solar tracking is high and is similar to that of Dakhla. These costs will, however, rise slightly if the simulation takes into consideration the compression and storage of hydrogen. This is because the compression of hydrogen from 30 bar to 700 bar takes approximately 1.36 kWh/kg. This will reduce hydrogen yield by approximatively 2%, and add storage and compressor costs in capital expenditure. Fig. 10 shows a comparison between the LCOH and the LCOE of the different studied cities while benefiting from state subsidies. Marrakech and Dakhla achieve the lowest LCOE reaching 2.39 $cent/kWh. On the other hand, Casablanca reaches the highest LCOE of 2.67 $cent/kWh. The cost of photovoltaic modules has dropped significantly in recent years and is expected to fall further in the next upcoming years. This drop is due to a number of factors such as market drivers, and policies. This latter triggered market growth which resulted in about 60% of the overall cost reduction. Example of policies measures which stimulated the growth of the PV market are subsidies, feed-in tariffs, renewable portfolio standards. Additionally, about 30% of the total cost decline is due to funded R&D in different countries; even though public research and development accounted for a greater share in previous years. Fig. 11 presents the predicted PV system CAPEX price for industrial applications (1 MWp) 2015–2050 [47]. The decline in PV cost will result in a decline in both the LCOE and LCOH as illustrated in Fig. 12 . Around 1 $cent per kWh for the production of hydrogen is expected to be reduced by 2050 if we consider only a decrease in PV cost. As this latter constitutes only 24% of the total system CAPEX. To verify the effectiveness of this work and validate the obtained results, a comparative analysis between the LCOE and LCOH obtained in this work and those of literature has been conducted. The LCOE of photovoltaic systems with different capacities as well as the calculated LCOH is shown in Tables 2 and 3 . The findings indicate that for a 20 MW photovoltaic power generation system, the LCOE is between 0.23 $/kWh and 0.41$/kWh depending on the production site and the provision of subsidies. These values are within the range of the LCOE obtained from the literature survey which varies between 0.45–0.67 $/kWh and 0.22–0.35 $/kWh for a 1 MW and 200 MW PV power, respectively [48, 49]. The LCOE is between 0.45–0.67 $/kWh [49] for PV power production of 0.001MW and 0.01 MW. The findings indicate that as the installed capacity increases, the LCOE of traditional PV drops. The results consider the impact of economies of scale on the costs used in the estimation of LCOE for PV systems. As for the cost of production of green hydrogen, the findings show that for electrolysis capacities ranging from 0.54 to 6 MW [50–52], the LCOH values are between $4.2 and $6.9/kg. These values are greater than those obtained in the current work in which the conventional PV provides the electrolysis plant with energy for hydrogen production purposes. Similarly, to lower the production cost, subsidies should be provided."
12,Environmental assessment,"Due to industrialization and rapid demographic growth, energy demand is increasing rapidly. This leads to the depletion of traditional energy resources such as fossil fuels. In addition, the main cause of environmental pollution and the destruction of the ecological equilibrium is the use of these latter resources. Hydrogen is now considered one of the key renewable energy sources and is experiencing growing development worldwide. There are many uses for green hydrogen, the most prominent one is the decarbonization of the different sectors. It is well worth noting that one of the most polluting sectors is the transportation one. In the following study, an environmental assessment has been performed to estimate how much GHG (greenhouse gasses) can be reduced using green hydrogen plants to fuel heavy-duty trucks powered by fuel cells. The data used in this simulation has been gathered from the literature [53,54] and is presented in Table 4 . To determine the reduced CO2 emissions, Eq. (40) is used. (40) C O 2 , reduced = D * C O 2 / k m , where C O 2 , reduced is the amount of CO2 emission reduced by the use of hydrogen as a fuel (kg/km). C O 2 / k m is the amount of CO2 emission reduced per km. D is the travel distance in km. This latter is calculated using Eq. 42. (41) D = E usable E / k m , Where E usable is the usable energy and E / k m is the energy consumed by the FCHDV per km. The usable energy is given by (Eq. (42)). (42) E usable = η F C * H 2 , edensity * H 2 , total , where η FC is average FCHDV efficiency H 2 , edensity is the hydrogen energy density (kWh/kg) In an effort to reduce CO2 emissions, hydrogen has been used in this study to fuel heavy-duty trucks. Table 5 summarizes the obtained results. An amount of 41,805.66 tonnes would be reduced by the use of hydrogen produced by all the different studied sites. This represents a small amount of CO2 emissions as compared to the country's total emissions from the transport sector [55]. The use of hydrogen produced by solar PV pant will minimize the consumption of fossil fuels. Less use of petroleum products results in lower emissions of greenhouse gas emissions and greater protection to the environment. Sustainable development would result in the optimal coexistence of resources and nature. Morocco strives to monitor the various technological changes linked to the global energy transition, taking into account its skills and its economic, and social characteristics. Morocco is strongly and willingly committed to international efforts to protect the climate and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in order to consolidate the principles of sustainability in the functioning of state services and in economic, social, and development investments approved by the Moroccan constitution. This has been done by adopting an innovative energy model based mainly on the development of renewable and clean energy and the strengthening of energy efficiency. The development of the business climate in this country that encourages investment, emphasizing Morocco's ambition to transform itself into a regional and international hub for the production and marketing of renewable energy and hydrogen, and expressing the country's willingness to enter into strategic partnerships in order to find appropriate solutions and investments, especially for the African market. Green Hydrogen is now a real opportunity for Morocco. The production lines built around hydrogen, commonly known as 'Power To X' (PtX), open up great prospects, thanks to the price of renewables. Morocco is positioned, according to the World Energy Council, as one of the five countries with the highest potential for the production and export of green molecules (ammonia, methanol, etc.). It could capture up to 4% of the global hydrogen market, according to the Ministry of Energy and Mines, or nearly $3 billion if you consider the 2018 market. A target that could be achieved in 10 or 15 years of the actual launch of this production. Combined with nitrogen, hydrogen will save Morocco the 2 million tonnes of ammonia imported annually. This value chain would be further enriched by carbon recycling to produce synthetic methanol, synthetic kerosene, synthetic diesel, and others [56]. Currently, the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (Masen) is working on the development of a hybrid photovoltaic/wind power plant to power a green hydrogen plant with an electrolysis capacity of about 100 MW. This is considered the first in Morocco and in Africa. IEA cited the Kingdom among the countries where electrolytic hydrogen would be almost competitive in terms of cost with natural gas and coal for the production of ammonia and methanol since it is among the countries where renewable electricity is the cheapest. Although these sites are far from the current demand centers for these products, they could attract foreign investment in the future [56]."
13,Conclusion,"The demand for a transition from fossil fuels to green energy sources has increased due to the growing environmental concerns. Hydrogen is considered today as one of the most promising sustainable energy sources. Morocco has all the assets to develop its production of green hydrogen. Hydrogen production from solar-powered PEM electrolysis is estimated in this work. The goal of this study is to estimate the cost of hydrogen production in different cities in Morocco. It is based on evaluating the economic and environmental impacts of partially replacing fossil fuels with 350 bar compressed hydrogen as an energy vector used to fuel heavy-duty trucks in certain cities of Morocco. The input parameters include the weather data in each respective city, the current market prices, and the costs of the different components of the green hydrogen projects such as the electrolyzer cost, PV plant, and BoP. The economic assessment provides an estimation of the LCOE and the LCOH. These latter indicators show how solar resource plays a very important role in green hydrogen projects profitability. The obtained results show that there are disparities between the different studied cities in LCOH. It seems that the southern part of Morocco possesses a very important solar potential compared to the north. This has resulted in an interesting LCOH of 5,3 $/kg in Dakhla and Marrakech as compared to 5,8 $/kg in Tetouan. The hurdle that must be overcome in order to achieve a more attractive LCOH and render green hydrogen as a profitable investment in the kingdom is to reduce the CapEx of the project; More specifically the CapEx of the electrolyzer should be reduced. The price of electrolyzer stacks is still high as there is a lack of facilities capable of mass-producing high-capacity stacks. Large green hydrogen projects can benefit from economies of scale and reduce the electrolysis plant's BoP and the renewable energy plant costs. However, there are still no feasible ways to reduce stacks' costs. It seems that subsidies for example are for now necessary to shoulder the high cost of green hydrogen projects. In Dakhla, a 50% reduction of the CapEx can drop the project's LCOH to below the 3,5 $/kg, which is better than the result available in the literature; a testament to the potential of green hydrogen production in Morocco. The kingdom already has low CO2 emissions in comparison to European countries. This can allow it to sell green hydrogen to Europe in an effort to promote green hydrogen development and reduce global GHG emissions. The solar potential of Morocco positions the country in the big leagues. Morocco is actually positioned among the top countries able to export hydrogen. This is due to several factors. Beyond the energy mix, the relevance of its energy transition strategy and its proximity to Europe make the country an appropriate destination for developing this energy industry. Producing green hydrogen would open up great prospects for Morocco, especially for export."
