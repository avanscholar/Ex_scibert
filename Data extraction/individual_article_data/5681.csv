0,Introduction,"Rapid industrialization, population growth and extensive human activities have increased energy and resource demands, resulting in continuous and excessive release of various organic waste products into the environment (Nasrollahzadeh et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). The widespread presence of refractory pollutants at low concentrations, such as endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), and pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in the aquatic environment, together with increasing amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) from combustion of fossil fuels, have had both obvious and subtle effects on human health and ecosystems (Kim et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2019; Manan et al., 2017). Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), especially hydroxyl radical-based AOPs (·OH-AOPs), such as Fenton and the catalytic ozonation process, have been widely used as promising methods to degrade pollutants from water and increased the biodegradability of these contaminants (Wang et al., 2019; Bhat and Gogate, 2020). Compared with these AOPs, photocatalysis (PC) and electrocatalysis (EC) not only have the power to oxidize pollutants but also demonstrate reducing ability in some situations, such as converting greenhouse gas CO2 into CH4, CH3COOH and other fuels or chemicals (Qiao et al., 2014; Zou et al., 2019). Although excellent work has been done for simultaneous pollutant degradation, mineralization and recycling of CO2 in traditional PC or EC reaction systems, researchers are still seeking more effective ways to enhance the capacities of these systems. Over the past few decades, photoelectrochemical (PEC) processes have received considerable attention since they potentially provide a one-stop solution for pollutant elimination, CO2 reduction and solar fuel production (Li et al., 2018). In PEC systems, a powder photocatalyst is immobilized on the electrode surface to form a photoelectrode, which not only maintains photocatalytic activity but also solves the problem of catalyst recovery after use. The photocurrent in the PEC system also promotes separation of photogenerated electrons (e–) and holes (h+) on the surface of the photoelectrode to enhance their utilization. Several research groups have reported the excellent performance of photoelectrodes in PEC processes. Rather and Lo (2020) reported a g-C3N4/Ag/AgCl/BiVO4 photoanode for simultaneous pollutant elimination, H2 production and E. coli deactivation. Liu et al. (2018) reported that a BiOBr photoanode and CuO photocathode could effectively oxidize tetracycline while also converting CO2 to fuels. The challenge of improving the efficiency of PEC processes is to design and fabricate new photoelectrodes with high PEC activity and stability. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has always been a focus of attention by researchers because of its unique advantages, such as lack of toxicity, high stability and photoactivity during PC processes (Guo et al., 2019). It is also believed that the effectiveness of TiO2 as a photocatalyst in the PC processes depends strongly on its crystallinity, crystal phase, oxygen vacancies and surface defects (Guo et al., 2019). For instance, anatase phase TiO2 (with a band gap of 3.2 eV) is more efficient as a photocatalyst than rutile phase TiO2, which has a band gap of 3.0 eV (Guo et al., 2019). A black anatase phase TiO2 is more photoactive than normal anatase because of abundant surface oxygen vacancies (Chen et al., 2011). However, there has been little research on the detailed influence of TiO2 characteristics in pollutant degradation coupled with CO2 reduction during PEC processes. Herein, we present a dual-chamber PEC reaction system to address two of the fundamental issues above. First, we used a chloride-mediated hydrothermal method followed by calcination to synthesize TiO2 thin film photoanodes. Physicochemical and electrochemical characterizations confirmed that both mediation by chloride and higher calcination temperature increased the number of oxygen vacancies in the TiO2 film. This led to the generation of more chemisorbed H2O (H‒O‒H) and surface bridging hydroxyl groups (Ti‒O‒H), which are considered as active sites during the PEC processes. Second, taking advantage of the unique structure of TiO2 thin film photoanodes and silver foil cathode prepared by our group before (He et al., 2016), the PEC reaction system achieved simultaneous degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ, an antiepileptic and psychotropic agent), H2 production and CO2 reduction. The pollutant degradation process was driven by irradiation of the photoanode with simulated solar light, while H2 production and CO2 occurred in the cathode chamber were initiated by electrons moving from the anode chamber in the presence of bias voltage. Hydroxyl radicals (·OH) were considered as reactive oxygen species in the anode chamber while the reduction of CO2 and evolution of H2 was initiated by H· and CO2 − in the cathode chamber. Our approach highlights that the prepared TiO2 photoanodes exhibit outstanding PEC properties for water purification coupled with CO2 reduction."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals and materials,"2.1 Chemicals and materials All chemicals in this study were of analytical grade or higher quality and obtained from commercial suppliers. Silver nitrate (AgNO3), CBZ, hydrofluoric acid (HF), sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3) were purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). Acetone, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), acetonitrile, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), sodium formate (CH3COONa) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) were purchased from Sigma (Shanghai, China). All stock solutions were prepared using high purity Milli-Q water (MQ, 18.2 MΩ cm) obtained from a Millipore Milli-Q water purification system. Titanium foil (20 × 20 × 0.5 mm) and silver foil (20 × 20 × 0.5 mm) were purchased from Jiayisheng Electronics Co., Ltd. (Kunshan, China). Carbon dioxide (purity 99.995%), carbon monoxide (purity 99.99%), hydrogen (purity 99.999%) and nitrogen (purity 99.99%) were purchased from Jingong Special Gas Co., Ltd. (Hangzhou, China)."
3,Synthesis of electrodes,"2.2 Synthesis of electrodes H-Ag was chosen as the cathode, which has been reported previously by our group (He et al., 2016). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) image of H-Ag cathode are shown in Fig. S1. The TiO2 film on Ti foil was prepared in two steps comprised of an in situ chloride-mediated hydrothermal process followed by calcination. Prior to hydrothermal treatment, the Ti foils were smoothed by sanding and then washed ultrasonically in acetone, isopropanol and MQ water for 30 min each time. The washed Ti foils were dried in a stream of N2. The pre-treated Ti foil was treated hydrothermally at 120 °C in 60 mL of 30% aqueous H2O2 solution containing 0.1 mM NaCl in a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave for 2 h. The obtained photoanode was denoted as 0.1CTO (0.1C represents the dosage of chloride and TO represents TiO2 thin film on Ti foil). In order to investigate the influence of chloride, a series of photoanodes was synthesized using different concentrations of NaCl (0–0.15 mM) and named as TO (no added chloride), 0.03CTO, 0.05CTO, 0.07CTO, 0.13CTO and 0.15CTO. After oven-drying at 80 °C overnight, the prepared photoanodes required further crystallization by calcination. After comparing the photoelectric responses of the seven synthesized photoanodes, 0.1CTO was chosen as the target photoanode. The 0.1CTO photoanode was calcined in air for 2 h at a heating rate of 2 °C min–1 to 350, 450 or 550 °C. The resultant photoanodes were labeled as 0.1CTO-350, 0.1CTO-450 and 0.1CTO-550. As control subjects, TO photoanodes were also calcined at the same three temperatures to produce TO-350, TO-450 and TO-550. Finally, all of the synthesized photoanodes were washed with MQ water and dried at 60 °C overnight."
4,Characterization and analytical methods,"2.3 Characterization and analytical methods 2.3.1 Physicochemical characterization The crystalline phases of the electrodes were determined by X-ray diffraction (Bruker D8 ADVANCE) using Cu-Kα (λ=1.5406 Å) radiation in the 2θ ranges of 10–80°. A 2θ range of 20–80° with a step size of 0.01° was chosen for grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) analysis. Electron microscopy was conducted at 300 keV using a Philips-FEI Tecnai G2 F-30 transmission electron microscope (TEM). In a typical measurement, powder scratched from the surface of an electrode was ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol and a drop of the highly diluted dispersion was applied onto a holey carbon-coated copper grid. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) analyses were also performed using the same equipment. FE-SEM and surface elemental analysis were performed at 15 keV using a Hitachi S4700 scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). The powder that was also used for TEM measurement was mounted using a conductive carbon double-sided sticky tape. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out on a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha+ photoelectron spectrometer using a micro-focused monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source using the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV as an internal standard. To obtain the band gap energies of the photoanodes, UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS) were recorded using a Shimadzu UV2550 spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere. Photoluminescence spectrum (PL) measurements were carried out using an Edinburgh FLS1000 spectrometer over a wavelength range of 570–800 nm with a 565 nm laser. 2.3.2 Photoelectrochemical characterization The electrochemical properties of the photoanodes were characterized in three-electrode systems using a Shanghai Chenhua CHI 760E electrochemical workstation. A diaphragm-free quartz three-electrode electrochemical cell was set up containing a working electrode (prepared photoanodes), a reference electrode (Ag/AgCl), and a counter electrode (Pt foil, 20 × 20 × 0.5 mm). Sodium sulfate solution (0.1 M) was used as the electrolyte. A 350 W xenon lamp (Laite optics, XD 300, cold light source) served as the visible light source in order to simulate solar radiation. The distance between the light source and photoanode was 7 cm, and the irradiation intensity was measured as 500 mW cm–2 using a Newport PMKIT-24–01 power meter. The full light wavelength spectrum of the lamp was offered by the manufacturer and that of solar light was measured by Kohantorabi et al. (2019) (shown in Fig. S2). Photocurrent densities (J-V) of the TiO2 thin film photoanodes were determined by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in both the presence and absence of CBZ (5 mg L–1) with a sweep range of −0.1–2.5 V at a scan rate of 0.05 V s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out at a frequency range extending between 0.1 Hz and 106 Hz with an AC amplitude of 5 mV. Nyquist curves were used to analyze the results. Amperometric i-t curves were determined at a bias voltage of 1.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) for 350 s with repeated light-dark cycles. Mott-Schottky plots were recorded from −0.1 to 1.0 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at a constant frequency of 1000 Hz, steps of 10 mV and amplitude of 5 mV. 2.3.3 Catalytic degradation of CBZ coupled with H2 production and CO2 reduction All PEC degradation and reduction experiments were conducted using a three-electrode configuration controlled by a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation in an H-type cell with Teflon cap separated by Nafion® 117 membrane. The prepared TiO2 thin film photoanodes, H-Ag cathode and Ag/AgCl were used as working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The cell was set in a cooling water system to maintain a steady-state temperature. The light source and intensity were the same as those used in the photoelectrochemical characterization. The anolyte was composed of 100 mL 0.1 M Na2SO4 containing 5 mg L–1 CBZ, while the catholyte was 90 mL 0.1 M KHCO3 solution. The cathode chamber was purged with CO2 gas for 0.5 h before the experiment and then the chamber was sealed using a threaded Teflon cap. The anode chamber was not purged with CO2 gas before sealed by a Teflon cap so the oxygen still existed in the anode chamber and anolyte. The reaction was started by introduction of the light source and a bias voltage of 1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl was applied between the anode and reference electrode. The reaction time was 240 min. Gaseous and aqueous samples were withdrawn at preset intervals. A separate set of control experiments was carried out using the same H-type cell as the reactor to examine the degradation rate of CBZ using direct photolysis (P), photocatalysis (PC) and electrocatalysis (EC) systems. The EC system was identical to the PEC system except that the light was off during the reaction. Compared with the PEC system, the cathode chamber of the PC system was emptied and the electrochemical workstation and wires were removed, while the TiO2 photoanode was kept in the anode chamber as photocatalyst. Irradiation was applied at the same place with the same light intensity as the PEC system. For the P system, the TiO2 photoanode was also removed and only 100 mL 0.1 M Na2SO4 containing 5 mg L–1 CBZ was placed in the anode chamber. The degradation rate of CBZ was analyzed using an HPLC (Waters 2695) equipped with a Symmetry C18 column and a UV–vis detector (Waters 2489). The mobile phase consisted of water and methanol mixed at a ratio of 30:70 (v/v). The flow rate was 1.0 mL min–1, the sample injection volume was 100 μL and the UV–vis detection wavelength was 280 nm. Mineralization of CBZ was monitored via total organic carbon (TOC) reduction, which was determined using a Shimadzu TOC-L analyzer. The CBZ degradation products were identified using an Agilent UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS system consisting of a 1260 UPLC coupled with a 6530 Q-TOF-MS/MS. A 5 μL sample was injected and eluted with water and methanol at a flow rate of 0.3 mL min–1. The electrospray ionization (ESI) operating parameters were as follows: ESI (+), full scan mode, ionization 4 kV, nebulizer pressure 35 psi, drying gas flow of 7 L min−1 at 350 °C, scan range of 100−500 m/z. The gaseous products in the cathode chamber (H2 and CO) were determined using an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) using argon (for H2 detection) or helium (for CO detection) as carrier gas. The injection port, column and TCD detector were maintained at 60, 50 and 200 °C, respectively. The faradaic current efficiency of each electrode catalyst was calculated using the following equation: (1) Faraday efficiency (FE) = (moles product/moles of electrons passed) × (number of electrons needed for conversion) Potential conversion to an RHE scale from Ag/AgCl was calculated to assess the activity and selectivity of the electrode on the same bias voltage as follows: (2) E (vs·RHE) = E (vs·Ag/AgCl) + 0.197 V + 0.0591 V × pH"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Electrode characterization,"3.1 Electrode characterization 3.1.1 Characterization of uncalcined TiO2 thin film photoanodes Physicochemical characterization of the uncalcined TiO2 thin film photoanodes prepared under various chloride concentrations was conducted to select the optimum photoanode for further calcination treatment. Diffraction peaks of the Ti foil (JCPDS No. 01-1198) were clearly visible in the XRD patterns of all samples (Fig. S3). The magnified patterns of all samples displayed two weak peaks situated at 2θ of 25.28° and 27.50°, which can be assigned to the (101) plane of anatase (JCPDS No. 21-1272) and (110) plane of rutile (JCPDS No. 01-1292), respectively (Sanehira et al., 2018). The low intensities of the anatase and rutile peaks suggest that the TiO2 films synthesized in situ on the Ti foil were thin and had low crystallinity. Relative to the TO sample, the anatase and rutile peak intensities of the other samples were slightly increased when the chloride dosage was increased from 0.05 to 0.1 mM. A further increase of the chloride concentration to 0.15 mM slightly decreased the anatase and rutile peak intensities, indicating that there was an optimum chloride dosage for TiO2 film formation. When the Ti foil was exposed to excess chloride (higher than 0.1 mM), the chloride would deeply enter the TiO2 lattice and form stable Ti-Cl bonds (i.e. Cl-doped TiO2), leading to reduced crystallinity of the TiO2 (Wang et al., 2016; Kőrösi et al., 2015). Since the aim of our study was to prepare TiO2 with the mediation of chloride rather than doping, the optimum concentration of chloride was determined to be 0.1 mM in this study. Fig. S4 shows a set of LSV curves in the dark and under simulated solar illumination. The current enhancement was insignificant in the dark, even at a potential of up to 1.5 V, which implied that no electrochemical oxidation occurred. Under illumination, a significant increase of current was observed for all photoanodes and the 0.1CTO sample exhibited the highest current density. This suggested that the 0.1CTO sample had the greatest ability to inject minority carriers (holes) into the solution (Cardenas-Morcoso et al., 2019). Considering the characterization data for all of the uncalcined CTO photoanodes, the 0.1CTO sample was selected as the optimum for further study after calcination at 350, 450 and 550 °C. The TO sample served as a reference sample and was also calcined at the same temperatures. 3.1.2 Characterization of TiO2 thin film calcined at various temperatures TiO2 peaks were hardly detectable in the XRD pattern of the calcined 0.1CTO-450 photoanode ( Fig. 1(a)) due to the thinness of the TiO2 film. The crystalline structure of the synthesized TiO2 thin film was therefore measured by GI-XRD instead of XRD (shown in Fig. 1(a)). Compared with the XRD pattern, the main characteristic peaks due to the (101) plane of anatase and the (110) plane of rutile were visible at 25.28° and 27.50°, respectively (Cardenas-Morcoso et al., 2019). Addition of chloride during preparation significantly increased the peak intensities of the TiO2 photoanodes (Fig. S5). Moreover, the intensity of reflections due to the rutile phase (peak R in the magnification of Fig. S5) increased as the calcination temperature was raised from 350 to 550 °C, indicating that the calcination temperature played a crucial role in adjusting the proportions of anatase and rutile (Testino et al., 2007). It is well known that TiO2 is polymorphous, existing in three fundamental crystal forms: rutile, anatase, or brookite. Generally, the phase transformation from amorphous to anatase TiO2 can be observed at relatively low calcination temperature. Increasing the calcination temperature leads to transformation of anatase phase into mixed anatase-rutile phases and finally to pure rutile phase (Noorimotlagh et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2010). The results in this study are consistent with this general trend. In general, anatase TiO2 with a suitable band gap (3.2 eV) exhibits higher photocatalytic activity than other phases of TiO2 due to the contribution of oxygen vacancy defects and surface crystal defects. Rutile TiO2 has a comparatively narrow band gap (3.0 eV) so usually exhibits a higher electric response than that of anatase TiO2. Therefore, mixed-phase TiO2 photoanodes with appropriate proportions of anatase and rutile phase exhibit superior PEC activity (Scanlon et al., 2013). In addition, the band gaps of 0.1CTO-350, 0.1CTO-450 and 0.1CTO-550 measured by UV–vis DRS (shown in Fig. S6) were estimated to be 3.45, 3.14 and 3.06 eV, respectively, indicating that these photoanodes can be mainly excited using ultraviolet light (λ<400 nm) while the visible light did not contribute much. The band gap of 0.1CTO-350 (3.45 eV) featured a blue shift compared with bulk anatase TiO2 (3.2 eV) due to oxygen vacancies or polycrystal grain boundaries on the surface of anatase TiO2 film (Jin et al., 2015). Further increasing the calcination temperature would increase the percentage of rutile TiO2 phase, leading to narrow band gaps. Insights into the composition and chemical states of the calcined TiO2 photoanodes were obtained from XPS studies. The full scan spectra of all six photoanodes (Fig. S7(a)) showed that Ti and O were the main elements. The C 1s peak at 284.6 eV was used as the reference peak for calibration of the XPS instrument. As shown in Fig. S7(b), all the Ti 2p spectra contained peaks at 458.5 and 464.4 eV, corresponding to the binding energies of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 of Ti4+, respectively (Si et al., 2020). Our XPS data did not show any evidence for the presence of Ti3+, which is consistent with the results from Li’s group (Li et al., 2005). The TiO2 surface contains a large number of dangling bonds due to the unsaturated coordination of titanium. These dangling bonds can hydrate the surface with polar hydroxyl groups and strong electron acceptor centers to form defect dipoles perpendicular to the outer surface, also known as coordinatively unsaturated Ti4+ ions. Therefore, the hydrated surface structure can be stabilized by hydrogen bonds with the TiO2 lattice or adjacent coordination of oxygen bridging OH-groups. From this, we can infer that if the surface defect sites are increased by chloride mediation, the proportion of surface hydroxyl groups in the corresponding XPS O 1s spectrum will increase accordingly. The high-resolution XPS O 1s spectrum of 0.1CTO-450 (Fig. 1(b)) was fitted into three peaks with binding energies at 530.3, 531.8 and 532.8 eV, corresponding to Ti‒O‒Ti, Ti‒O‒H and H‒O‒H, respectively (Diebold, 2003). Ti‒O‒Ti usually refers to the lattice oxygen on the TiO2 surface, while Ti‒O‒H refers to the surface bridged hydroxyl group and H-O-H represents surface-bound water. Water does not absorb on the Ti‒O‒Ti bond but can chemisorbed (H‒O‒H) or even dissociatively absorbed on some defect sites such as surface oxygen vacancies. This leads to the generation of bridging hydroxyl groups (Ti‒O‒H) which are considered as active sites for the generation of reactive oxygen species or the adsorption of target pollutants during AOPs (Namai and Matsuoka, 2005; Kim et al., 2010). Thus, the presence of oxygen vacancies on the TiO2 surface allows more water molecules to be attached generating more Ti‒O‒H and H‒O‒H bonds and thereby increasing the potential active sites for the PEC process. Compared with the O 1s spectrum of 0.1CTO-450, the O 1s spectra of the other TiO2 photoanodes (Fig. S7(c)) were significantly different. As the calcination temperature was increased, the O 1s peak position was gradually shifted to lower values. The percentages of the three surface oxygen forms were also changed (details are shown in Table 1). Compared with TO photoanodes, the Ti‒O‒H and H‒O‒H percentages were significantly increased in 0.1CTO samples. The Ti‒O‒H and H‒O‒H percentages in 0.1CTO-450 samples reached 18.31% and 34.04%, respectively, representing 2.2-fold and 6.7-fold increases compared to those of the TO-450 photoanode. Similarly, increased calcination temperature greatly enhanced the proportion of H‒O‒H on the photoanode surface, ranging from 18.45% in 0.1CTO-350 to 46.58% in 0.1CTO-550. The increased percentages of Ti‒O‒H and H‒O‒H were mainly due to increasing numbers of oxygen vacancies induced by chloride mediation and calcination. The unstable Ti-Cl bonds generated during the hydrothermal process can be exchanged with dissociated water molecules during the washing process, forming surface hydroxyl groups (Liu et al., 2020; Pei et al., 2016). In addition, the increased calcination temperature can not only improve the crystallinity of TiO2, but also enhance the transformation of TiO2 phases from anatase to rutile, which has more oxygen vacancies (Xu et al., 2017). Thus, the two-step process of chloride-mediated hydrothermal synthesis followed by calcination is a successful strategy to increase the number of surface oxygen vacancies on TiO2. Additionally, no peaks were observed in the Cl 2p (Fig. S7(d)) or Na 1s (Fig. S7(e)) spectra of the photoanodes (Hosono et al., 2004), implying that sodium chloride was washed away after hydrothermal reaction to leave negligible amounts on the surface. The morphologies and nanostructures of 0.1CTO-450 thin film photoanodes were investigated by FE-SEM and TEM. Compared with pristine Ti foil (Fig. S8), the FE-SEM image (Fig. 1(c)) showed that the foil was entirely covered by 2D leaf-like TiO2 nanosheets with an average width of 120 nm and a thickness of 20 nm. All of the TiO2 nanosheets were curved and randomly connected to each other, forming a quasi 3D structure. This type of structure would enhance the pseudocapacitance of the photoanode in aqueous electrolytes by improving ionic diffusion to redox active sites and enlarging the interfacial area between the electrode and electrolyte (He et al., 2017). The FE-SEM images of all the photoanodes are shown in Fig. S9 and well-defined 2D leaf-like TiO2 nanosheets can be seen in all samples. Unlike the 0.1CTO samples (Fig. S9(e)–(h)), structures on the TO photoanode surfaces (Fig. S9(a)–(d)) had larger diameter and were thicker, which suggests that chloride rather than calcination had a greater impact on the morphologies and nanostructures of TiO2 thin films. The EDS spectrum of 0.1CTO-450 (Fig. S10) showed that the thin film contained Ti, O, Na and Cl with a Ti/O ratio of 1:2, consistent with the stoichiometric ratio of TiO2. As shown in Fig. 1(d), the TEM image revealed that the 2D leaf-like nanosheets of 0.1CTO-450 had a thin and stacked layer structure. The corresponding HRTEM (Fig. S11) consisted of three components: lattice fringes of the selected area were 0.224, 0.324 and 0.352 nm, which matched the (101) plane of Ti foil, (101) plane of anatase TiO2 and (110) plane of rutile TiO2, respectively, in agreement with the XRD data (Sanehira et al., 2018). Given that charge separation, transfer, and carrier lifetime have a direct impact on photoelectrocatalytic processes, the photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of all photoanodes ( Fig. 2(a)) were used to evaluate the fate of the charge carriers. Broad luminescence bands centered at 610 nm were observed in the PL spectra of all samples, which were ascribed to the radiative recombination of free holes with trapped electrons (Mercado et al., 2011). The TO-350 and TO-450 photoanodes displayed strong PL intensities, indicating high recombination of charge carriers. In comparison, the PL intensities of the 0.1CTO samples decreased as the proportion of rutile phase was increased by higher calcination temperature, indicating that intrinsic recombination of photoexcited electrons and holes was efficiently hampered. The PL results revealed that surface defects and oxygen vacancies of 0.1CTO samples increased as the calcination temperature was increased, consequently promoting the electron transfer capacity as well as photoelectrocatalytic activity (Nasr et al., 2015). In addition, the peak intensities of 0.1CTO-450 and 0.1CTO-550 were similar, suggesting that there was an optimal concentration of defects and oxygen vacancies for charge separation and transfer. The LSV curves of the illuminated photoanodes are shown in Fig. 2(b). The TO-350 photoanodes exhibited the lowest photocurrent density. In contrast, 0.1CTO-450 photoanodes had the highest photocurrent density of 1.4 mA cm–2 at 1.5 V. All photoanodes displayed the lowest photocurrent onset potential at 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl. These results demonstrate that TiO2 photoanodes with appropriate proportions of anatase and rutile phases exhibit excellent charge transfer and separation (Cardenas-Morcoso et al., 2019). The interfacial electron transfer resistances of the prepared TiO2 photoanodes were assessed by recording EIS spectra. As shown in Fig. 2(c), overlapping arches are observed in the EIS spectra of TiO2 photoanodes in the three-electrode test-cell, in which semicircles at high and low frequency regions are caused by resistance of the electrode-electrolyte interface (Rint) and charge-transfer resistance (Rct), respectively (Ramadoss and Kim, 2013). Fig. S12 shows the EIS spectra of the TO sample and all 0.1CTO samples in the high frequency region under dark conditions (inset shows the fitted equivalent circuit data). The TO sample exhibited the highest Rint, while the 0.1CTO-450 photoanode exhibited the lowest, due to the change of TiO2 crystallinity. In general, a catalyst with low crystallinity is not suitable for electron excitation or transfer, while high crystallinity leads to fewer surface oxygen vacancies. Fig. 2(c) shows Nyquist plots of three calcined 0.1CTO photoanodes in the dark and under illumination. The semicircle of all 0.1CTO photoanodes in the dark is higher than under illumination, indicating that charge transfer resistance strongly decreased under illumination. This result can be attributed to further generation and accumulation of photogenerated electrons that increase the current on TiO2 photoanodes. The observed values of Rct for 0.1CTO-350, 0.1CTO-450 and 0.1CTO-550 under illumination were 788, 1018 and 1179 Ω, respectively. This value suggests that all the 0.1CTO photoanodes accelerated charge transfer kinetics and exhibited high charge transfer efficiency, which is beneficial for PEC performance (Bouhjar et al., 2019). The Mott-Schottky (M-S) plots of all photoanodes are presented in Fig. 2(d). Space charge capacitances were measured by varying the potential from −0.1 to 1.0 V vs. RHE at a frequency of 1 kHz. The calculation of flat band potential (Efb), charge carrier density (ND) and space charge layer (W) is provided in Text S1 (Spagnol et al., 2009). All the M-S plots had a linear portion and the positive slopes confirmed that these TiO2 photoanodes had p-type semiconductivity. Calculation of slope, Efb and ND requires at least 200 mV of linear region in the M-S plots, so there were insufficient data from Fig. 2(d) for TO-350 and 0.1CTO-350 photoanodes. The calculation results for the remaining photoanodes are shown in Table 2. The Efb of TO-450 and TO-550 were −0.042 and − 0.034, respectively. The addition of chloride in the preparation of 0.1CTO-450 and 0.1CTO-550 photoanodes resulted in more positive Efb. It has been recognized that a higher flat band potential leads to efficient charge separation (Ranjan and Sinha, 2019). Similarly, the 0.1CTO-450 photoanode gave the highest value of ND (2.41 × 1019), indicating that a TiO2 photoanode with appropriate proportions of anatase and rutile phases can effectively decrease the e––h+ recombination sites at the interface between photoanode and electrolyte. In addition, the thicknesses of W for all TiO2 photoanodes were all in the range of 13.5–21.5 nm, strongly driving charge separation on the surface of TiO2 photoanodes (Yu et al., 2012)."
7,Degradation of CBZ and reduction of CO2 coupled with H2 production,"3.2 Degradation of CBZ and reduction of CO2 coupled with H2 production Fig. 3 shows the CBZ degradation efficiency and reduction of CO2 coupled with H2 production by six different photoanodes under PEC processes at a bias voltage of 1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the 0.1CTO-450 photoanode exhibited the highest CBZ degradation rate, reaching 73.08% ± 1.67% after 4 h reaction. All photoanodes synthesized in the presence of chloride exhibited higher CBZ degradation than those prepared in the absence of chloride. The order of CBZ degradation activity for the photoanodes paralleled that of the photocurrent density by LSV measurement, suggesting that photocurrent has a remarkable influence on the catalytic activity of the photoanodes. Fig. 3(b) shows various CO2 reduction products and H2 generation, together with their Faraday efficiencies (FE). Detailed data are also shown in Table 3. The CTO photoanodes exhibited significantly enhanced CO2 reduction products (CO and HCOOH) and H2 generation under various calcination temperatures. The 0.1CTO-450 photoanode gave the highest CO and HCOOH production rates as well as the third highest H2 production. Although the bias voltage was 1.5 V for all six photoanodes during the PEC processes, the actual potentials of the photoanodes as counter electrodes varied due to their different abilities to generate photocurrent. The actual potential of the cathode as working electrode therefore varied according to the current flowing from the photoanode (Aoi et al., 2017). Since the selectivity of the H-Ag cathode in the competition between CO2 reduction and H2 generation was strongly dependent on the actual potential of the cathode, the highest yields of CO and HCOOH were achieved under the appropriate actual potential developed by the 0.1CTO-450 photoanode (Qiu et al., 2016). As shown in Fig. 3(b), the formation of CO, HCOOH and H2 by using 0.1CTO-450 photoanode within 4 h reaction reached, 108.23 ± 8.96 μmol, 10.77 ± 0.75 μmol and 152.6 ± 4.34 μmol. The corresponding FE values were 36.91% ± 1.21%, 3.94 ± 0.08% and 59.23% ± 2.31%, respectively. The 0.1CTO-450 photoanode gave the highest CO and HCOOH production capability as well as the best FE, proving its excellent performance for photoelectric catalytic degradation of CBZ while simultaneously driving CO2 reduction at the cathode. The superior photoelectric catalytic activity of the 0.1CTO-450 photoanode is mainly derived from its appropriate proportions of anatase and rutile TiO2 phases, resulting in suitable actual potential, high photocurrent response and low recombination of photogenerated e––h+ pairs (Shi et al., 2020). Under these conditions, more photogenerated holes participate in CBZ oxidation, while more photogenerated electrons are transferred to the external circuit to drive CO2 reduction as well as H2 generation at the cathode. In addition, changing the ratio of anatase and rutile TiO2 phases could maximize the expected production of CO and HCOOH by changing the actual potential in cathode (Yamamoto et al., 2017; Moustakas and Strunk, 2018). Table 3 also shows the ratio of H2/CO generated in different photoanode reactions after 4 h reaction. The ratio of H2/CO generated by photoanodes prepared without chloride mediation was between 4 and 9. However, the ratio was between 1 and 3 for CTO photoanodes. The ratio obtained with 0.1CTO-550 was 2.07, which is close to the ratio of synthesis gas required for industrial production of methanol (Eq. (1)) or other alcohols (Sanguineti et al., 2015). (1) CO + 2 H 2 = C H 3 OH In an attempt to evaluate the performance of the 0.1CTO-450 photoanode in the PEC process for pollutant degradation coupled with CO2 reduction and H2 production, a summary of some of the latest related studies on PEC processes (mainly titanium-based electrodes) are presented in Table 4 (Liu et al., 2018; Peng et al., 2012; Koo et al., 2017; de Brito et al., 2019; Cheng et al., 2015). Analysis of the PEC system in this study should reflect two aspects: pollutant degradation efficiency at the anode and product generation at the cathode. 0.1CTO-450 exhibited moderate pollutant degradation efficiency (73.08% ± 1.67% after 4 h) and comparable TOC removal rate (25.67% ± 1.26% after 4 h) at a bias voltage of 1.5 V. This is because the pollutant used in this study, CBZ, is refractory to degradation during water treatment. In the cathode chamber, the H2 production and/or CO2 reduction ability of 0.1CTO-450 was comparable to most previously reported TiO2 photoanodes listed in Table 4. The CO2 reduction capability in a photocathode-driven system is dependent on the cathode itself while in a photoanode-driven system it is dependent on various factors such as photoanode and cathode electrodes, photocurrent, actual potential, CO2 reduction catalyst or photogenerated electron transfer (Cheng et al., 2015). In addition to the superior photoelectric catalytic performance of the photoanode mentioned above, the modified Ag cathode (H-Ag cathode) used in this study presented lower overpotential for CO production, higher CO2 reduction selectivity and higher FE compared with a pristine Ag cathode (He et al., 2016), indicating that the PEC system using the 0.1CTO-450 photoanode and H-Ag cathode is reasonable for pollutant degradation, together with simultaneous CO2 reduction and H2 production. Above all, it is apparent that the 0.1CTO-450 photoanode has superior PEC physicochemical properties, including lowest recombination of charge carriers, highest photocurrent density and lowest Rint. Furthermore, the PEC system containing the 0.1CTO-450 photoanode not only gave the highest CBZ degradation, but also exhibited the highest selectivity for products of CO2. Considering that competition between H2 generation and CO2 reduction cannot be avoided in the cathode chamber, and that CO2 reduction is normally more difficult than H2 generation, the 0.1CTO-450 photoanode was selected as the appropriate photoanode for further study even though it did not give the highest H2 production."
8,Effect of bias voltage,"3.3 Effect of bias voltage Degradation of CBZ and combined CO2 reduction and H2 production in PEC processes at different bias voltages were explored using 0.1CTO-450 as photoanode as shown in Fig. 4. As the bias voltage was increased from 0.5 to 1.5 V, the CBZ degradation rate increased from 46.50% ± 1.97% to 73.08% ± 1.67% and then decreased to 62.98% ± 1.69% as the bias voltage was increased to 2.0 V (Fig. 4(a)). The same trend was observed for the TOC elimination rate of CBZ, reaching the highest rate of 25.67% ± 1.26% at a bias voltage of 1.5 V. The decreased degradation rate of CBZ at bias voltage of 2.0 V may be attributed to the influence of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at higher overpotential. The LSV results from TiO2 photoanodes under dark conditions (Fig. S4) revealed that obvious OER reaction may start to happen at bias voltage of ~2.0 V, which fits our results during the PEC process (Gong et al., 2011). According to Pinhedo’s assumption, CBZ can be degraded by active oxygen species such as ·OH at appropriate bias voltage (Eq. (2)). At higher bias voltage, the OER process (Eq. (3)) occurs, resulting in consumption of ·OH and competition with CBZ degradation (Pinhedo et al., 2005). (2) · OH + CBZ → products (3) 2 ⋅ OH → O 2 + 2 H + + e − It was found that the concentration of CBZ in the anolyte decreased exponentially vs. time as shown in Fig. 4(a). The degradation rate can be expressed by the following equation (Eq. (4)): (4) − d [ CBZ ] d t = k ⋅ OH / CBZ [ CBZ ] × [ O × H ] SS where [CBZ] is the concentration of CBZ and k ∙OH/CBZ is the absolute reaction rate constant between ∙OH and CBZ (8.8 × 109 M–1 s–1) (Huber et al., 2003). Since the ∙OH radicals were induced by stable irradiation, the concentration of transient ∙OH radical remains stable in the anolyte (i.e., steady state concentration of ∙OH, (∙OH)ss), and Eq. (4) can be integrated to Eq. (5). (5) ln ( [ CBZ ] [ CBZ ] 0 ) = − k ⋅ OH / CBZ [ O ⋅ H ] SS × t = − k app × t where (CBZ)0 is the initial concentration of CBZ and k app is the apparent reaction rate constant. Therefore, the exponential decrease of CBZ was mainly due to the decrease of CBZ concentration and side reactions between ∙OH and CBZ degradation products (Von Sonntag and Von Gunten, 2012). These phenomena can also be observed in the following experiments in this study. The corresponding pseudo-first-order reaction rate and the related apparent rate constants (k app) for each CBZ process are shown in Fig. 4(b). In addition, the results acquired from L-H model calculation (Text S2 and Fig. S13) proved that the PEC degradation of CBZ primarily occurred on the surface of TiO2 photoanodes (Hoffmann et al., 1995; Wang et al., 2018). Transient photocurrent response results (Fig. S14) revealed that the 0.1CTO-450 photoanode had high photosensitivity and photostability for numerous on-off cycles in the presence of CBZ (Li et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2014). The results obtained for PEC reduction of CO2 are presented in Fig. 4(c) within a bias voltage range of 0.5–2.0 V, where H2, CO and HCOOH are all produced. The yields of CO and HCOOH were significantly enhanced as a function of bias voltage due to the increased photocurrent. In contrast, formation of H2 decreased as CO2 reduction increased, indicating competition between hydrogen formation (water splitting) and CO2 reduction. The FE of each product (shown in Fig. 4(d)) increased as the bias voltage was increased from 0.5 to 1.5 V but barely changed as the bias voltage was increased from 1.5 to 2.0 V. Typically, increasing the external bias voltage can enhance surface band bending of TiO2 and promote separation of photogenerated carriers, leading to enhanced PEC oxidation. However, the maximum thickness of the space charge layer was limited due to the thickness of the photoanode, and the number of photogenerated electrons was fixed at constant light intensity (Ling et al., 2016). The separation of photogenerated electrons will gradually reach a maximum at a saturated photocurrent. Consequently, increasing the external bias voltage from 1.5 to 2.0 V marginally enhanced the FE of each product."
9,Stability of the photoanode,"3.4 Stability of the photoanode Photoelectric catalytic stability and reusability are important parameters to consider in a potential application since they directly influence process costs. The reusability of 0.1CTO-450 was determined by reusing the same photoanode in seven consecutive PEC cycles with a total duration of 28 h. The photoanode was washed thoroughly with MQ water after each process. As shown in Fig. 5, the CBZ degradation rate did not vary significantly at a bias voltage of 1.5 V, ranging from 75.75% to 67.73%. The amounts of CO, HCOOH and H2 produced were maintained at more than 66.85, 6.79 and 162.2 μmol, respectively. The GI-XRD pattern of the photoanode after seven cycles (shown in Fig. S15) was identical to that of the unused photoanode, demonstrating excellent stability of the 0.1CTO-450 photoanode. The Ti 2p and O 1s spectra of the 0.1CTO-450 photoanode after seven cycles are shown in Fig. S16. The banding energy of each deconvoluted peak did not considerably shift. The ratio of Ti‒O‒H and H‒O‒H was changed slightly, which could be explained by passivation of a small part of the 0.1CTO-450 photoanode surface. This result implies that the 2D leaf-like TiO2 film formed on the surface of Ti foil by in situ oxidation was tightly integrated with the Ti foil, inducing a stable structure that conferred both chemical stability and PEC activity."
10,Synergetic photoelectrocatalytic mechanism,"3.5 Synergetic photoelectrocatalytic mechanism To identify the mechanisms involved in CBZ degradation, several control experiments, such as direct photolysis (P) and photocatalysis (PC), were conducted as shown in Fig. 6(a). Limited degradation of CBZ was observed both in P (11.94% ± 1.21%) and PC (19.89% ± 1.08%) processes after 240 min reaction due to the finite catalyst dosage and strong resistance of CBZ to illumination. Comparison of the 1.5 V bias voltage applied to the system in the dark (EC) and under light illumination (PEC) revealed that CBZ degradation was negligible in the EC process, while PEC exhibited the most potent degradation of CBZ. It was found that 73.08% ± 1.67% of CBZ was degraded after 240 min during the PEC process, which is not only 3.67-fold higher than the PC process but also much higher than the EC process. Therefore, a remarkable synergetic effect was observed for EC and PC degradation of CBZ on the 0.1CTO-450 photoanode driven by simultaneous bias voltage and illumination. Scavenging experiments were conducted to evaluate the contribution of different reactive species. Solutions (1 mM) of IPA and EDTA were used as trapping agents to capture hydroxyl radicals (∙OH) and h+, respectively (Adhikari et al., 2019). As a h+ scavenger, EDTA could absorb on the surface of TiO2 to form surface Ti-EDTA complex which act as sacrificial electron donors (Kim and Choi, 2010; Labaran and Vohra, 2014). IPA acted as an ∙OH scavenger due to its high rate constant with ∙OH (k=4.3 × 109 M–1 s–1) in the solution and weak adsorption onto TiO2 surface (Lloyd et al., 1976; Serna-Galvis et al., 2016). As shown in Fig. 6(b), CBZ degradation was significantly inhibited in the presence IPA or EDTA, suggesting a critical role of ∙OH and h+. The ∙OH in PEC processes is mainly generated in two ways: (1) oxidation of H2O (mainly surface adsorbed hydroxyl molecule OH–) by h+ and (2) dissociation of H2O2. Since photogenerated electrons pass through the external circuit to the cathode driven by the bias voltage, dissolved oxygen in the anode electrolyte is unable to capture electrons and generate superoxide radicals (O2 ∙–) in this system through Eq. (6), which also limits the chain reaction of ∙OH generated through Eqs. (7)–(10) (Li et al., 2018). As a consequence, ∙OH was mainly generated through oxidation of adsorbed hydroxyl molecule OH– by photogenerated h+ (Eq. (11)). In the presence of EDTA, the photogenerated h+ will react with Ti-EDTA complex on the surface of TiO2 rather than adsorbed hydroxyl molecule OH–, resulting in the inhibition of ∙OH generation through Eq. (11). The similar inhibitory effects of IPA and EDTA on CBZ degradation (Fig. 6(b)) also provides direct evidence for the generation pathway of ∙OH. (6) photoanode → hv e − + h + (7) O 2 + e − → O 2 ∙ − (8) O 2 ∙ − + H + → HO 2 ∙ (9) HO 2 ∙ + HO 2 ∙ → H 2 O 2 + O 2 (10) H 2 O 2 + e − → ∙ OH + OH − (11) h + + OH − → ∙ OH By combining the experimental and characterization data, a mechanism for the synergetic effect on CBZ degradation during the PEC process is proposed in Scheme 1. Under illumination, the 0.1CTO-450 photoanode can be excited, inducing electron transition from the valence band (VB) of TiO2 to its conduction band (CB) to leave h+ in the VB. The 0.1CTO-450 photoanode exhibited high e––h+ photogeneration and separation rates due to a favorable mixed-phase ratio of rutile and anatase compared with other photoanodes in this study (Shi et al., 2020). With the assistance of bias voltage, the whole PEC system provides suppressed recombination of photogenerated e––h+ and fast electron transfer, which was confirmed by PL spectra, EIS measurement and PEC activity assessment. Thus the h+ accumulated in the VB of 0.1CTO-450 oxidized HO– to generate ∙OH, which is the main species contributing to CBZ degradation during the PEC process. Following consumption of ∙OH during CBZ oxidation, the photogenerated electrons continue to flow through the external circuit under bias voltage and reach the cathode. Since O2 in the cathode chamber has been purged by CO2, resulting in anaerobic conditions, the electrons tend to react with protons to produce hydrogen radicals (H·) rather than O2 ∙– during the PEC process (Eq. (12)). The generated H· will recombine rapidly to form hydrogen (Eq. (13)) (Jeon et al., 2018). Meanwhile, the consumed protons will be replenished from the anode chamber (shown in Scheme 1). (12) H + + e − → H ∙ k = 2.3 × 10 10 M – 1 s – 1 (13) H ∙ + H ∙ → H 2 2 k = 1.55 × 10 10 M – 1 s – 1 In addition, the electrons and generated hydrogen radicals could react with CO2 (shown in Scheme 1). Carbon dioxide is converted to its radical anion (CO2 ·–) by reaction with electrons and then to CO by disproportionation (Eqs. (14) and (15)). In contrast, reaction with hydrogen radicals would first convert carbon dioxide to formic acid radical (HCO2 ·), which can then undergo further reaction with H· to form HCOOH (Eqs. (16) and (17)) (Peng et al., 2012; Singh et al., 2017). In order to clarify the contribution of electrons and H· during the PEC process, scavenging experiments were designed using nitrate (NO3 –) and nitrite (NO2 –) as electron and H· scavengers, based on previous work (Cheng et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2015). As shown in Fig. S17, adding nitrate greatly retarded CO2 reduction and H2 generation. Only 13.2 ± 0.77 μmol of CO and 34.5 ± 2.76 μmol of H2 were generated, while the generation of HCOOH was completely inhibited. NO3 – acts preferentially as an electron scavenger (Eq. (16)), k=9.7 × 109 M–1 s–1, although it can also react with H·, but at a much lower reaction rate (Eq. (18)), k=4.4 × 106 M–1 s–1 (Velo Gala et al., 2013). Compared with NO3 –, the addition of NO2 – generated more CO and less H2, due to its reaction rate constants with electrons (Eq. (20), k=3.5 × 109 M–1 s–1) and H· (Eq. (21), k=7.1 × 108 M–1 s–1) (Velo Gala et al., 2013). HCOOH was also not detected due to the strong H· scavenging ability of NO2 –. Therefore, it is proposed that both electrons and H· are important for CO2 reduction and H2 generation during the PEC process, while NO3 – and NO2 – exhibit slightly stronger inhibition of CO2 reduction and H2 generation, respectively. (14) CO 2 + e − → CO 2 ⋅ − k = 7.7 × 10 9 M – 1 s – 1 (15) CO 2 ⋅ − + CO 2 + e − → CO + CO 3 2 – (16) CO 2 + H ⋅ → HCO 2 ⋅ (17) HCO 2 ⋅ + H ⋅ → HCOOH (18) e − + NO 3 – → NO 3 2 – k = 9.7 × 10 9 M – 1 s – 1 (19) H ⋅ + NO 3 – → NO 2 n + HO – k = 4.4 × 10 6 M – 1 s – 1 (20) e – + NO 2 – → NO 2 ⋅ 2 – k = 3.5 × 10 9 M – 1 s – 1 (21) H ⋅ + NO 2 – → NO + OHO – k = 7.1 × 10 8 M – 1 s – 1 The proposed mechanism for the whole PEC system, represented in Scheme 1, is as follows: During the anodic process, e– and h+ are generated by irradiation on the surface of the 0.1CTO-450 photoanode. The h+ could then oxidize HO– to ·OH for CBZ degradation. The e– is driven to the cathode, where it can participate in the reduction reaction, through the external circuit by applying bias voltage. The CO2 is converted into CO and HCOOH, accompanied by the inevitable competing electroreduction of H2O to H2."
11,"Potential, prospects and implications","3.6 Potential, prospects and implications The benchmarking solar-to-syngas (STS) efficiency (η STS) of the 0.1CTO-450 photoanode during the PEC process with a bias voltage of 1.5 V was calculated according to the method described by Chu et al. (2018) (Text S3). The STS efficiency reached 0.06%, which is comparable to that found in several other studies (from 0.01% to 0.18%) (Chu et al., 2016; Jang et al., 2016; Kong et al., 2016). Moreover, some groups reported that their CO2 reduction PEC systems achieved solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency of 19% and 20% while the current highest solar-to-hydrogen efficiency in a PEC system has already reached 30% (Xiao et al., 2020; Cheng et al., 2020; Jia et al., 2016). Since these outstanding PEC systems focus on CO2 reduction rather than simultaneous pollutant degradation, our study can broaden the perspective on concurrent water treatment and CO2-to-fuels in PEC systems. It is unfortunate that, to date, PEC processes or CO2 reduction technologies have hardly been used in large-scale commercial applications. This is partly due to the low cost and large number of products and fuels that can be accessed directly from fossil fuels, while the main reason still centers on the CO2 reduction PEC process itself. Although our PEC system yields selective CO2 reduction syngas (CO and H2) and liquid product HCOOH at low over-potential, the cost of CO2 enrichment and syngas separation, the STS efficiency of the photoanodes and the size of the whole PEC plants are major barriers for commercialization. The cost of CO2 is about 60–90 € ton–1 and that of methanol produced from syngas (CO and H2) is about 245–270 € ton–1, suggesting that PEC CO2 conversion should still be closely watched for further application opportunities (Ganesh, 2016). With the development of carbon dioxide capturing and storage (CCS) technologies and design of novel electrodes with high selectivity, stability and sustained photocurrent density, the simultaneous pollutant degradation and CO2 reduction of the PEC system could a sustainable means to alleviate global warming, water purification needs and energy shortages."
12,Conclusions,"In conclusion, we have successfully developed a two-step strategy to fabricate TiO2 thin film photoanodes comprised of a hydrothermal method with chloride mediation followed by calcination. Both the hydrothermal and calcination processes were responsible for the crystallinity, anatase/rutile ratio and surface oxygen vacancies and defects of the photoanodes. These characteristics played significant roles in e––h+ photogeneration and transfer. The TiO2 thin film exhibited superior PEC activity compared with other photoanodes or the sum of PC and EC processes. The TiO2 prepared with 0.1 mM chloride and calcined at 450 °C gave the highest CBZ degradation efficiency (73.08% ± 1.67%), CO and HCOOH production of 108.23 ± 8.96 and 10.77 ± 0.75 μmol, as well as the third highest H2 production (152.6 ± 4.34 μmol) after 4 h reaction. The main active species in the anode chamber for CBZ degradation were ·OH evolved from h+, while the formation of CO, HCOOH and H2 was initiated by H· and CO2 ·– in the cathode chamber."
