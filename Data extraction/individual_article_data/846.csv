0,Introduction,"Since last few decades the aggravation of environmental and energy crisis has been rising due to the usage of fossil fuels for energy and other daily human activities [1,2]. At present, approximately, 85% of global energy consumptions are fulfilled from non-renewable resources including fossil fuels [3]. Reduction in reserves of fossil fuels and related environmental concerns has provoked substantial research efforts towards hydrogen (H2) fuel as a renewable, alternative and environmentally friendly energy carrier for the post fossil fuel regime [4–6]. For the future high energy capacity, hydrogen is recognized as the best energy carrier [7] releasing zero greenhouse gas emission, thus is considered as an alternative energy source to mitigate global warming effects [8,9]. Since 1972, the photoelectrochemical water splitting by Fujishima and Honda [10] has led to deep interest in photocatalytic hydrogen production from water and sunlight [11], as solar energy is considered Earth's most abundant source having minimal contribution towards environmental contamination [12]. Moreover, global solar energy possess technical potential that is a number of times more than the current total energy demand [13]. Hydrogen production is the best known strategy to overcome the forthcoming consequences of environmental pollution with zero global warming [14,15]. Moreover, H2 energy is considered as a sustainable, long lasting, clean, renewable source of energy [16], which can be easily stored [17,18]. A large range of semiconductor materials for photocatalytic hydrogen production have been recognized including graphene, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), conjugated polymers, metal/non-metals and carbon based photocatalysts [15,19,20]. However, most of them activate only under UV irradiation due to wide band gap [21], lack cost effectiveness and efficiency [22]. Thus, visible light photocatalysts are highly demanding as wide range of solar spectrum lies in visible light range [23,24]. Solar spectrum contains only less than 10% UV light, while more than 90% light energy lies in visible spectrum range [25]. During the past years, a number of semiconductor materials as photocatalyst with high quantum efficiencies have been reported for water splitting [26]. However, currently suitable photocatalytic materials having suitable band gap and good stability are lacking for water splitting [27]. Moreover, in the recent years, titanium oxide (TiO2) [28,29], cadmium sulfide (CdS) [30,31] and graphitic-carbon nitride [32,33] are mostly studied materials for water splitting, but show less efficiency towards photocatalytic process. CdS is recognized as a semiconductor with suitable band gap [34] but shows high charge recombination rate and instability for practical application [35]. Similarly, TiO2 is known as an excellent photocatalyst due to its advantages such as non-toxicity, easy availability, low cost and photostability [36,37]. However, it shows less efficiency for photon to hydrogen conversion because of faster charge recombination in addition to its wide band gap (3.2 eV) leading to UV-light activity [37,38]. Recently, perovskite based materials are under considerations as they are multifunctional and have wide range of properties such as ferromagnetic, ferroelectric, dielectric, piezoelectric, superconducting and semiconducting [39]. Perovskites are known to be originated from calcium titanate perovskite oxide (CaTiO3) family with general formula ABO3 and contains several types such as titanates, tantalates, ferrites, niobates and vanadate perovskites, which are recently reported for photocatalytic applications [40]. These materials show photocatalytic activity and stability under visible light irradiation and this can be accredited due to their distinctive electronic and structural properties. Alteration in crystal structure, band gap tuning and band edge modification can be employed to enhance absorption of visible light for the photocatalytic process. Moreover, the recombination of charge carrier in perovskites can be reduced by distortion in the lattice structure and by creating oxygen vacancies [41]. Furthermore, the photocatalytic activity of perovskite materials can be further enhanced by doping with foreign elements such as metals or non-metals. Generally, the vacancy of anion and cation is indirectly influenced by doping with metals and non-metals [42]. For instance, doping of metals like Ag and Cr into titanate SrTiO3 can make it visible light active. The high visible light absorption of halide perovskites allow them to generate more H2, however, they have lower stability in slurry systems [43]. Similarly, structure of layered perovskite allows the diffusion of dopants easily, resulting in enhanced H2 generation under solar energy. The aim of this review is to highlight recent developments in perovskite materials, thermodynamics analysis for selective H2 evolution, band engineering evaluation and modification approaches to enhance photocatalytic activity of perovskites for sustainable and renewable energy production. Firstly, the fundamentals including mechanism for hydrogen production by perovskites and thermodynamics are briefly discussed. Secondly, an overview of perovskites with their modification approaches for enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production by dopants is systematically discussed. The developments in perovskite composites in view of direct and indirect Z-scheme heterojunction for improved electron-hole pair's separation are discussed in detail. Finally, this review highlights recent challenges and future perspectives of perovskite material for hydrogen production."
1,Fundamentals of perovskite and thermodynamics analysis,
2,Mechanism of photocatalysis for H2 evolution,"2.1 Mechanism of photocatalysis for H2 evolution Photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen generation can be accomplished by utilizing principles of photocatalysis from wastewater or pure water in the presence of light irradiations e.g., sunlight [44]. Light energy from the sunlight is converted into chemical energy in the presence of a suitable photocatalyst during the process of photocatalysis for H2 production [45]. Photocatalytic water splitting and photocatalytic reforming of organic substances [46] are two widely employed methods for hydrogen evolution. In the process of water splitting, electrons and holes are produced by redox reaction, while in photocatalytic organic material reforming electrons are generated by organic material and proton ions are generated after oxidation [47]. Lastly, the electrons are involved in converting protons (H+) into H2 over the surface of photocatalyst [46]. In general, for the evolution of hydrogen, photocatalytic system requires reactants, photocatalyst, photo-reactor and light source. Pure water or water mixed with sacrificial reagent can be employed as a reactant and light source can either be UV light or visible light, however, visible light photocatalysts are highly demanding as they can capture substantial part of sunlight [48]. Moreover, for effective photocatalysis process for hydrogen production, an active interaction between all the components including light, catalyst and reactants is necessary [49]. Fig. 1 illustrates steps involved in perovskite photocatalysis including light harvesting (stage 1), charge excitation (stage 2), charges separation and transfer (stage 3), and surface catalytic reactions or redox reaction (stage 4). Firstly, photocatalysis starts when light energy with wavelength greater than or equal to the band gap of the photocatalyst strikes over the perovskite surface. The semiconductor perovskite consists of valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB), which are separated from each other by band gap energy (Ebg). Secondly, when light strikes over the perovskite, electronic transitions are initiated, resulting in generation of electron/hole (e−/h+) pairs (Eq. (1)). Thirdly, electrons and holes are separated due to the excitation of electrons from the VB to CB, leaving holes in the VB. Lastly, redox reaction takes place in which electrons are involved in the reduction of protons, while, holes are involved in the oxidation of water. During the oxidation reaction, holes decompose water into H+ as shown in (Eq. (2)), while (Eq. 3) shows formation of H2 after protons (H+) gain electrons. More importantly, redox reaction occurs on the surface of perovskite photocatalyst when the reduction potential of perovskite is above the CB and oxidation potential is below the VB of the photocatalyst [50]. Photoexcited holes have great oxidizing properties which are capable of oxidizing organic compounds like alcohols as illustrated in Eq. (4). (1) P e r o v s k i t e → h v e − + h + (2) H 2 O + h + → 1 2 O 2 + H + (3) 2 e − + 2 H + → H 2 (4) R C H 2 O H + 2 h + → R C H O + 2 H + Photocatalytic water splitting is a challenging task because the entire process starting from charge carrier generation to surface catalytic reactions for producing H2 requires appropriate wavelength, intensity and energy. However, most challenging task is the fast recombination of photogenerated charge carriers due to short life time. Electrons generated in the CB can recombine with the holes inside the volume of photocatalyst or at the surface known as volume and surface recombination, respectively, to generate unproductive energy as a heat [51]. Commonly, three types of recombination are possible: First, band-band recombination is a radiative transition occurring mostly in the direct band gap semiconductors in which electrons in conductive band move to the valence band having holes; second, trap-assisted recombination in which an electron falls into an energy level within the band gap known as trap formed due to structural defect. Once trap gets filled with electrons they cannot accept more electrons. Finally, the electrons in the trap move into valence band resulting in their recombination. In auger recombination, electrons and holes have possibility to recombine in a band-to-band transition. However, in this case, the resulting energy is given off to another electron or hole. Therefore, for successful water splitting, the redox reaction and charge separation in the photocatalyst must proceed within the lifetimes of the photo-excited charge carriers [52]. For this purpose, highly efficient and selective semiconductor materials functional under solar energy are high in demand for hydrogen production application."
3,Thermodynamics analysis,"2.2 Thermodynamics analysis In photocatalytic water splitting, a photocatalyst should have band gap larger than the standard Gibbs free energy change (1.23 eV) and a smaller band gap than incident light energy for the photo-excitation to take place. Moreover, the conduction band potential should be more negative than the water reduction potential and potential of valence band should be more positive than the water oxidation potential. Secondly, it should be in a good capacity to separate and transfer photo-generated charge carriers, thus restraining their recombination. Thirdly, for accelerating redox reaction and for suppressing backward reaction, sufficient active sites should be available on the photocatalyst surface. Photocatalyst should be able to generate, excite and transfer photogenerated charge carriers and should be able to carry out redox reaction [53]. Therefore, for enhanced photocatalytic H2 production process, in addition to semiconductor material absorbing solar energy, the material should have appropriate band structure to carry oxidation and reduction reactions. Moreover, understanding about this process can be obtained through the thermodynamics evaluation of the perovskite materials. Thermodynamics in perovskite as a semiconductor photocatalyst can be discussed in terms of type and intensity of light, width of band gap, CB and VB of perovskite semiconductor. Usually, perovskite consists of a totally filled VB and partially filled or empty CB. Between VB and CB there exists a forbidden energy level having varying population of electrons and holes, termed as band gap energy (Eg). When light energy higher than band gap energy falls on the perovskite, the population of electrons in VB and holes in CB is disturbed. Due to shorter relaxation time within the conduction band as compared to the band gap, the probability of electrons to achieve equilibrium within energy level is more than across the band gap [54]. Electrons with internal equilibrium are called quasi equilibrium and potential of electrons and holes in quasi-fermi levels is given by Eqs. (5) and (6). The maximum thermodynamic driving force for electrons and holes for inducing photocatalytic reaction can be explained by Eq. (7) [55]. (5) F n = E c + k B T ln n N c (6) F p = E v + k B T ln P N c (7) Δ G = − | F n − F p | = − E g − k B T ln n p N v N c where, Ec and Ev are CB minimum and VB maximum energy level positions, respectively, ΔG denotes Gibbs free energy provided by light irradiations, kB denotes Boltzmann constant, Nc and Nv are effective densities of states in CB and VB respectively and n, p denotes carrier concentrations. For effective water splitting, band gap of perovskite must be 1.23 eV < Eg < 3.26 eV. There are two types of light irradiations; light irradiation with wavelength 200–400 nm is UV, while, irradiation with wavelength between 400 and 800 nm is visible light. UV light can activate perovskite with band gap wider than 3.15 eV, whereas, perovskite with band gap below 3.15 eV can be activated by visible light. Secondly, for hydrogen evolution the reduction and oxidation potential must lie within the band gap of perovskite [56]. The bottom of the CB should be more negative than the redox potential of H+/H2 i.e., −0.41 eV vs NHE whereas, top of the VB should be more positive than the redox potential of O2/H2O i.e., +0.82 eV vs NHE [57]. Higher number of electron-hole pairs can be generated using lamp with high power as higher light intensity cause generation of more photon flux for excitation of electrons per unit time in the semiconductor. However, poor photocatalytic efficiency even under high power lamps should possibly be due to fast recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes and inappropriate band structure of catalyst for efficient oxidation and reduction process. Photocatalytic reaction is directly proportional to light intensity but absorption of wavelength depends on the band gap and morphology of catalyst and design of photoreactor [58]. For instance, Fig. 2 (a, b) shows perovskites with narrow and wide band gaps, respectively. Narrow band gap perovskite semiconductors show absorption in the wavelength of 400–800 nm and wavelength of 200–400 nm is absorbed by a wide band gap perovskite. Therefore, before selecting type of light source, band gap and other characteristics of catalyst should be identified for getting efficient photoactivity for hydrogen generation."
4,Recent advancements in perovskite materials,
5,ABO3 perovskite,"3.1 ABO3 perovskite Currently, the development of novel binary metal oxide considered as third generation photocatalysts is under consideration denoted generally by A x B y O z formula. It includes perovskites and related materials, iron spinals denoted by AB2O4, tungstate, molybdate and vanadate containing compounds denoted by A3+B5+O4. Perovskite has a general formula ABO3, where, A denotes rare or alkaline earth metal and B denotes first row transition metals. Large ionic radius cations occupy A sites in the structure, coordinating 12 oxygen atoms. while small ionic radius cations occupy B sites in the perovskite structure, coordinating 6 oxygen atoms [41]. Perovskite constitutes advantages of excellent characterized structure as well as good surface properties with basic and alike structures, variable valences, valence metal ions and abundant O2 vacancies, which makes them appropriate for photocatalytic H2 generation [59]. Classification of ABO3 perovskite can be carried out as A1+B5+O3, A2+B4+O3 and A3+B3+O3 perovskites based on the valence and includes different groups of perovskites with varying rate for H2 production. Niobates (ANbO3, A = Na, K, Ag, Cu) and Tantalates (ATaO3, A = Na, K, Ag, Li) are included in A+1B+5O3 subgroup of ABO3 perovskite. Moreover, it also includes vanadium-based perovskites. Tantalates constitute an appropriate band gap based on the Ta 5 d orbitals. Also, phenomenon of efficient carrier delocalization occurs by the structure distortion of TaO6 connections and is attributed to the crystalline structure, leading to enhanced photocatalytic activity [60,61]. For instance, NaTaO3 and KTaO3 belonging to tantalate perovskites constitute effective properties such as their availability, less toxicity and constitute CB edge that is more negative than H+/H2 potential [41]. However, NaTaO3 has been reported to constitute a wide band gap (4.0 eV) as the VB contains O 2p orbitals, making it active only under UV light irradiations in addition of charge recombination. KTaO3 having a band gap of (3.6 eV) is also recognized as a photocatalyst under UV irradiations, but less studies are reported for H2 production. Pristine KTaO3 was observed to produce 228 μmolg−1h−1 of H2 from water-methanol mixture as sacrificial agent under stimulated sunlight [62]. In another study, Xu et al. [63], reported pristine AgTaO3 to produce low rate of H2 i.e., 20 μmolg−1h−1 from water-methanol mixture as sacrificial agent under UV irradiations, while, showing complete inertness under visible light. Moreover, niobates including NaNbO3 (3.08eV) and KNbO3 (3.14 eV) have been reported for photocatalytic H2 production under UV irradiation due to their wide band gap [64], but at the same time NaNbO3 is considered for photoactivity based on its nontoxicity, stability and crystal structure which is capable of promoting charge transfer due to corner-shared octahedral [NbO6] in its structure [65,66]. Liu et al. [67], reported pristine NaNbO3 nanowires to produce 32 μmolg−1h−1 of H2 under mimic sunlight. In another study, H2 rate of 350 μmolg−1h−1 was observed for pristine NaNbO3 from formic acid as sacrificial agent under UV–Visible irradiation [68]. Vanadium (B-site) based perovskites includes AgVO3 which exist as crystal structure of α-AgVO3 with band gap of 2.5 eV and β-AgVO3 with 2.3 eV band gap. However, AgVO3 constitute a CB which is inappropriate for photocatalytic H2 production and is best for O2 evolution reaction and water treatment [69]. ABO3 perovskite has another A+2B+4O3 subgroup containing titanates (ATiO3 where, A = Ca, Sr, Ba, Mg, Fe etc.) as the predominant perovskites as well as B site occupied zirconium (Zn) and tin (Sn) containing perovskites. Titanates show unique electronic properties, optical properties and good stability, but wider band gap makes them active only under UV irradiations [70]. SrTiO3 is the most primitive and widely studied titanate perovskite based on its suitable band levels and flat band potential, which makes it appropriate for water splitting, ability of electron transforming among Ti3+ and Ti4+, availability of surface defects and high stability. However, wide band gap of 3.2 eV hinders its visible light activity. In a study by Ikeue et al. [71], pristine photocatalytic activity of SrTiO3 revealed to be 30 μmolg−1h−1 from 50% methanol-water mixture under UV-irradiation, while, in another study, 8 μmolg−1h−1 rate of H2 production from 15% of methanol as sacrificial agent under UV light has been reported [72]. Furthermore, as compared to other titanates perovskites, titanates consisting of transition metals oxides having d 0 and d 10 orbitals such as Co2+, Fe2+, Ni2+ offers narrow band gap, leading to visible light activity. However, they have an unsuitable CB for carrying out water reduction and their photoactivity is only limited for photooxidation and water treatment reactions. Yet, ZnTiO3, CdTiO3 and PbTiO3 with band gap 3.68 eV, 4.0 eV and 2.72 eV, respectively are rarely studied for photocatalytic H2 production. Carrasco et al. [73], reported 28 μmolg−1h−1, 41 μmolg−1h−1 and 46 μmolg−1h−1 of photocatalytic H2 production from pure water under UV irradiations from ZnTiO3, CdTiO3 and PbTiO3, respectively [73]. CaTiO3 is considered as another prominent perovskite having wide band gap (3.5eV) [74] constituting remarkable photoelectric, dielectric and catalytic photoelectric properties [75]. Moreover, studies report CaTiO3 to exhibit photocatalytic H2 production from pure water under UV irradiation. Also, CaTiO3 has an appropriate band alignment i.e., a VB lower than the water oxidation potential and a CB higher than hydrogen reduction potential. Moreover, it has a band structure comparable to TiO2 making it able to display photocatalytic activity [76]. Pristine CaTiO3 has been reported to produce insignificant H2 under visible light irradiations and 325 μmolg−1h−1 of H2 from methanol as sacrificial agent under UV irradiation [74]. Another study reports H2 generation of 60 μmolg−1h−1 and 30 μmolg−1h−1 under UV irradiation and visible irradiations from 0.05 M sodium sulfite aqueous solution [77]. Other than this, Fe2TiO5 is recognized as a pseudobrookite n-type titanate semiconductor with a narrow band gap of 2.1 eV. Based on its availability, stability, non-toxicity and charge transfer property, it has been used in dielectric anode and sensor material as well as material for electrode in photo-electrochemical process [78]. Also, Fe2TiO5 constitute an electronic and atomic structure close to that of TiO2 [79]. Fe2TiO5 has been employed as co-catalyst in photo-electrochemical process, but, limited studies are available on its photocatalytic activity. 157 μmolg−1h−1 of H2 from triethanolamine as the sacrificial agent under simulated sunlight was reported for pristine Fe2TiO5 [80]. MgTiO3 having a band gap of 3.5 eV is also recognized as a principle titanate photocatalyst for water splitting, but is not much explored for photocatalytic H2 production. It owns an appropriate electronic structures for water splitting with CB at −1.13 eV and VB at 2.37 eV potential for carrying out redox reaction of water splitting into H2 and O2 [81]. Besides, bottom of CB for MgTiO3 consist of a transition-metal d orbitals (Ti4+), which is empty and is positioned at more negative potential than 0 eV. Also, a noble flat band of MgTiO3 makes it more desirable towards photoactivity [82]. Zhang et al. [83], reported 100 μmolg−1h−1 of H2 production by using MgTiO3 as photocatalyst with methanol-water mixture under UV irradiation. Zirconium containing perovskites are not much explored for instance; SrZrO3 is considered as a photocatalyst, but lacks studies focusing on water splitting due to its wide gap of 5.6 eV. It is a potential photocatalyst as it offers an appropriate band alignment with VB and CB lower than the oxidation potential of water and higher than hydrogen reduction potential, respectively [84]. Moreover, it also shows outstanding stability and excessive active sites for photocatalytic activity [85]. Guo et al. [84], studied pristine SrZrO3 for H2 production and observed 29 μmolg−1h−1 production of H2 from pure water under UV irradiation. Tin based perovskite such as CaSnO3, BaSnO3 and SrSnO3 constitute a wide band >4.0 eV, thus their photocatalytic activity is rarely found in literature. Among Tin based perovskites, SrSnO3 is capable of showing better hydrogen production rates under UV irradiation [47,86–89]. ABO3 also contains subgroup A+3B+3O3 constituting of ferrite perovskites having narrow band gaps with visible light photoactivity. Normally, iron oxides and hematite compounds have a low CB with other limitations including less electron conductivity and short diffusion of exciton. Ferrite perovskites have been reported to overcome the limitations of other iron oxides by showing good photocatalytic activity [90]. For instance, LaFeO3 is known as a principle photocatalyst with a narrow band gap of 2.07 eV, making it active under visible irradiation. It offers advantages of optoelectronic properties as well as it is nontoxic and highly stable [91]. LaFeO3 has been reported to depict visible light activity towards photocatalytic H2 production, but literature still lacks studies of photophysical properties of LaFeO3. BiFeO3 with a band gap of 2.2 eV has been studied to show visible light activity towards water splitting. Moreover, it depicts multiferric properties and magneto-electric properties, which can be employed for the enhanced photoactivity by improved charge carrier separation. Though, the reduction potential of BiFeO3 is 0.3 V which is more positive as compared to the water reduction potential, but still it has issues of chemical stability in photocatalytic water splitting [92]. Iervolino et al., [93]. and yang et al. [94], reported the utilization of LaFeO3 and BiFeO3 respectively, towards photocatalytic H2 production. PrFeO3 is recognized as a praseodymium ferrite and was reported for H2 production with cocatalyst from ethanol-water mixture because of its good ferromagnetic and ferroelectric properties [95]. Moreover, GaFeO3 has been observed as a ferrite perovskite for visible light water splitting activity with a yield of around 2 μmolg−1h−1 due to its deactivation with passage of time. YFeO3 (2.43 eV) and AlFeO3 are also considered as ferrite perovskite. but are only reported for photocatalytic decomposition of organic pollutants [96]. SrTiO3 is been considered as an attractive UV active photocatalyst in comparison to other titanates based on its transformation flexibility between Ti3+ and Ti4+ and surface defects. However, pristine CaTiO3 has been investigated for highest photocatalytic H2 production titanate under UV irradiation. Furthermore, it has also been identified for photoactivity from pure water under UV irradiations. Niobates including NaNbO3 is been observed for more improved H2 production rate based on its efficient charge separation ability as compared to tantalates. Ferrite perovskite including LaFeO3, BiFeO3 and GaFeO3 are not considered as ideal photocatalyst for photocatalytic H2 production as compared to titanates and tantalates however, the photoactivity of LaFeO3 is studied to be a good photocatalyst in ferrite perovskites."
6,Modification approaches for ABO3 perovskite,"3.2 Modification approaches for ABO3 perovskite Structure of perovskite is a cubic crystal lattice comprising of ABO3 stoichiometry which is capable of accommodating most of the metallic ions in the periodic table together with a significant number of other anions. This is due to various degree of lattice distortion in the real perovskite structure [97]. The distortion in the crystal lattice of the perovskite affects the whole photocatalytic activity as it changes the electronic band structure and dipole of perovskite. These changes in electronic band structure influence the excitation, transfer, and redox reactions of photogenerated charges [98]. Furthermore, the choice of the perovskites for photocatalytic H2 production is linked to their semi-conductivity and chemical photostability [99]. However, photo-activity of perovskite is lower due to wide band gap and fast charge recombination. Several modification approaches have been investigated to enhance photoactivity of perovskite for enhanced hydrogen production. Incorporation of constituent elements essentially to retain the basic structure of perovskites are widely investigated to improve photoactivity and selectivity for H2 evolution. In addition, more than 90% of metals can effectively be doped into the perovskite lattice without changing the structure and morphology [100]. Similarly, other approaches for modification of perovskites include doping with non-metals, substituting A or B site of ABO3 perovskite, formation of solid solution, incorporation of nitrogen into the perovskite lattice and formation of composites. 3.2.1 Metal and non-metal loading to ABO3 perovskite Modification of perovskite semiconductors with metals is attributed to the work function value of metals (ɸ) and energy of fermi level, which should be lower than the CB of semiconductor for efficient electrons migration to metals [101,102]. The higher work function of metals can be significant for efficient separation of electron-hole pairs and improvement of metals ability to accept electrons [103]. Moreover, higher difference of metal's work function with semiconductor, leads to higher Schottky barrier, resulting in faster charge separation for increased hydrogen production. In recent years, metals including Pd, Au, Ag, Al Cu, Fe, La, Zr, and Cr are reported to enhance efficiency of perovskites. Metal doping to perovskite is a surface modification approach to suppress electron-hole pairs recombination by acting as an electron trap. Metals have the tendency to act as a cocatalyst by providing increased active sites for H2 production reactions [104]. Furthermore, metal nanoparticles loading to perovskite forms Schottky barrier as the Fermi level of metals is lower than the conduction band of perovskites. Similarly, during band alignment of semiconductor and metal, there develops an electronic potential barrier at the semiconductor-metal heterojunction (Schottky barrier), which increases the transfer of electrons to the metal and acts as an electron trap [102]. In heterojunction of semiconductor-metal, the photogenerated electrons are transferred to metal from the CB of perovskite via Schottky barrier until their Fermi levels becomes equal, while, restraining the holes in the VB of perovskite [103]. For instance, Husin et al. [105], reported reduction in charge recombination of NaTiO3 by doping with La3+ which acted as a donor dopant and provided extra electrons. Similarly, Yu et al. [106], studied narrowing band gap of SrTiO3 with Cr3+ doping which was further reduced by incorporation of N as shown in Fig. 3 (a). It was observed that the amount of H2 production was significantly enhanced with higher recycled stability over Cr/N co-doped SrTiO3 as illustrated in Fig. 3 (b). Similarly, enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution over Cu-doped SrZrO3 was obtained as illustrated in Fig. 3 (c). Improved separation of electron hole pairs was observed at the interface of n-type SrZrO3 and p-type CuO semiconductor, resulting in significantly improved H2 evolution [107]. In another work, Meng et al. [108], investigated that wide band gap of BaZrO3 (Eg = 4.96 eV) was reduced to 2.84 eV by Fe3+ doping, which increased hydrogen production under visible light as shown in Fig. 3 (d) [108]. Moreover, incorporation of noble metals induces Surface Plasmon Resonance effect (SPR) under visible light for enhanced photocatalytic activity [109]. In the case of semiconductor-metal heterojunction under visible light, the metal contains photogenerated electrons in the Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR), which are directly transferred to the CB of perovskite and reduction reaction takes place at the surface of perovskite [48]. Several plasmonic metals such as Pt, Au and Ag can enhance photocatalytic hydrogen production through formation of Schottky junction and strong SPR effect under visible light [110,111]. For instance, Fig. 4 (a) illustrates the significance of perovskite-metal interface for photocatalytic chemical reactions including: (1) fast flowing and energetic charge carriers, (2) formation of Schottky barrier, (3) excess charge carriers or oxygen vacancies on perovskite, and (4) generation of hot electrons for efficient light trapping [112]. For example, Xu et al. [113], investigated the use of Ag nanoparticles as a dopant for enhanced hydrogen production, enabling higher light harvesting and faster charge separation through Localized Surface Plasmon effect. Fig. 4(b) shows that the contact between AgTaO3 and Ag metal facilitates direct injection of electrons to CB of AgTiO3, which are further consumed for H2 evolution through reduction process. Likewise, Fig. 4 (c) shows SPR effect of Au to facilitate transfer of electrons from the Au metal to CB of BaTiO3. The back flow of electrons to Au was prevented by Schottky barrier [114]. Recently, bimetallic nanoparticles containing two different metals have been found more efficient to maximize photocatalytic activity compared to monometallic particles. This is obviously due to their characteristics such as extraordinary optical, electronic, catalytic properties and expected synergic effect [115,116]. In this view point, Rodríguez et al. [117], reported enhnaced hydrogen evolution using multilayer system of ITO/NaTaO3/Au–Pd. Addition of Au–Pd bimetallic particles increased hydrogen evolution by increasing active sites and improving absorbance of visible light. The formation of suitable Schottky barrier at the semiconductor and metal interface also contributed to increased H2 production [67]. Loading Pt nanoparticles (NPs) accomplished the successful transfer process of electrons, while reducing the recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs in NaNbO3 nanowires. Fig. 4 (d) depicts the photocatalytic mechanism indicating charge separation at the surface of NaNbO3 nanowire and subsequently transferring electrons to Pt nanoparticles for reduction of protons to H2. The further charge carrier recombination was prevented by reaction of holes with methanol, thus, maximizing H2 evolution during photocatalytic process of water splitting and organic reforming process. Doping of perovskite semiconductor with non-metals is relatively a new technique for improving photocatalytic hydrogen production. A variety of non-metals including C, N, and S etc. are studied to boost the photocatalytic activity. When the semiconductor perovskite is doped with non-metal, the band gap becomes narrow and causes the hybrid 2p band to be formed between CB and VB of perovskite. Under visible light irradiation, the electrons are transferred to the intermediate 2p band from VB of semiconductor and then are excited to the CB from the intermediate band to produce H2. This electron excitation process requires lower energy and also hinders charges recombination [119]. For example, Chen et al. [62], boosted photocatalytic hydrogen activity of C doped KaTaO3 up to 2.6 times as illustrated in Fig. 5 (a) by extending visible light absorption and by reducing recombination of charge carriers. More importantly, this photocatalytic system maintained photoactivity even after eight cycles. Similarly, introducing carbon can also promote more electrons to migrate at the catalyst surface, resulting in superior reduction process for hydrogen production. In another work, Wang et al. [120], investigated incorporation of N for narrowed band gap, shifted optical absorption to the visible light region and enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production. The proposed mechanism of N incorporation into KTaO3 as reported by Rao et al. [121], for hydrogen production has been presented in Fig. 5 (b). With nitrogen doping to KTaO3, the valence band formed hybrid N 2p and band gap was reduced to 2.54 eV as presented in Fig. 5 (c). Thus, band gap of KTaO3 was reduced from 3.53 to 2.54 with N doping, which enabled higher visible light absorption for maximizing H2 production. Likewise, Fig. 5 (d) depicts the mechanism of charge separation and transfer within N doped SrSnO3. Firstly, after excitation under UV light irradiation, charges were generated and electrons were transferred to the CB, leaving the holes behind. Subsequently, the holes were transferred to the energy level of doped N and electrons were left behind, promoting efficient charge separation. Table 1 summarizes the literature of ABO3 perovskites doped with metals and non-metals, showing H2 generation activity under various reaction conditions. It can be observed that metal loading to perovskite is an effective approach to promote activity of ABO3 perovskite. Appropriate Schottky barrier at metal and perovskite interface can improve charge transfer process. Furthermore, the work function of metals play significant role in reducing electron hole pairs recombination over the semiconductor surface [103]. SPR effect under visible light is the major cause for considerable attention of researchers towards noble metals like Ag, Au and Pt. Doping of perovskite with non-metals is considered more appropriate approach as it narrows the band gap of perovskite semiconductor and reduces centers for charge recombination, which otherwise exist in most of metal ion doping. 3.2.2 A site and B site substitution in ABO3 perovskite The chemical and physical properties of perovskites can be altered for enhanced photocatalytic activity by A site doping, B site doping and anion doping as depicted by Fig. 6 (a and b), illustrating the concept of A site substituted Bi0·5Na0·5TiO3 and B site substituted BaFe0·95Ca0·05O3 perovskite crystal structure. Variation in anionic sub lattice is linked to formation of randomly dispersed oxygen vacancies and well-ordered new structures. O2 vacancies are linked to reduced surface charge recombination and enhanced charge transfer. Anionic changes are not much explored yet; they induce changes in metal-ion bond in terms of iconicity, leading to different changes in properties of perovskites [152]. However, electron-hole system is recognized to be advantageous to photocatalysis, which is entirely influenced by cation doping. Moreover, cation ion doping technique is more convenient and economical as well as advantageous for tailoring electron structure and enhancing visible light activity [53]. Generally, the size and radius of doped cations are important parameters influencing the properties of perovskite. Substitution of A ion in ABO3 by different valence state A’ ion also modifies the valence state of B metal ion. Moreover, this substitution induces defects and oxygen vacancies into the structure, which influence the optical and photocatalytic activity. Thus, by taking charge balance under consideration, the combination of dual metal ions rationally is an effective approach to design new photocatalyst perovskites. For interpretation, it was observed that BaTiO3 has a more positive conduction band than the reduction potential of H+/H2 which makes it unable to generate H2, but partially substituted Ba(II) ions by Zn(II) ions forming Ba5/6Zn1/6TiO3 constituted favorable property to be an active photocatalyst due to better charge mobility and narrowed band gap [153]. Similarly, Wang et al., [154] studied A site substituted Bi0·5Na0·5TiO3 after partial substitution of Na at A site in BaTiO3 forming sodium bismuth titanate. Fig. 6 (c) depicts that amount of H2 produced can be controlled by adjusting alkalinity and highest H2 at 9 M of NaOH was due to high conduction band edge, increased active sites and suppressed electron hole recombination. Similarly, Hu et al. [155], reported K-doped monoclinic NaTaO3 showing absorption of wavelength region longer than the absorption edge. A B–O–B bond angle of 180° has been investigated for efficient electron hole pairs separation. Fig. 6 (d) indicates that pristine NaTaO3 constitutes a bond angle of less than 180° as A site is occupied by smaller sized Na which hinders charge separation. Whereas, Fig. 6 (e) indicates that in K doped NaTaO3, Ta–O–Ta bond angle of 180° facilitated efficient band gap reduction and charge separation. An overview of recent development on A site substituted perovskite photocatalysts along with their band gaps, structure, photocatalytic reaction parameters and hydrogen generation has been summarized in Table 2 . Overall, La doped at A site and Pt supported La0·02Na0·98TaO3 depicted highest photocatalytic H2 production from glycerol-water mixture. Moreover, the structural and chemical properties of NaTaO3 make it an ideal photocatalyst which was further investigated for photoactivity improvement by A site doping of La. This was mainly due to the inhibition of charge carrier recombination due to formation of ohmic junction between Pt and La0·02Na0·98TaO3 as well as also due to the electron donating property of glycerol. Other than A-site substitution, another possibility for alteration of physicochemical and photocatalytic properties of perovskites is substituting different cations at B site. Band gap of photocatalyst can be altered by combining and varying ratio of two or three metal cations rationally at B site. Usually, B site cations in ABO3 perovskite control the level of conduction band. Moreover, they are involved in forming framework of perovskite structure with oxygen atoms. For example, Xu et al. [161], reported that when NaTaO3 was partially substituted at B site with Cu, it temporarily trapped electrons and prolonged their lifetime, thus, limiting charge recombination and improved photocatalytic activity. In another work, Mondal et al. [162], studied doping of Zr+4 into KNbO3, which was 13 times more efficient for increasing H2 production and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity (Fig. 7 (a)) as compared to pristine KNbO3. Fig. 7 (b, c) indicates that doping Zr (IV) led to formation of acceptor states near the valence band, which reduced the band gap from 3.29 eV in the pure system to 3.15 eV for the doped system. Wang et al. [163], reported 2333.3 μmolg−1h−1 H2 production by substituting Ta5+ with Nb5+ in NaTaO3, when some energy levels were formed under the CB which narrowed band gap of NaNb0·5Ta0·5O3. Fig. 7(d–e) shows that NaNb0·5Ta0·5O3 constituted layered structure, leading to the increased reaction sites, hence, absorbing more solar energy. An overview of recent development on A and B site substituted perovskite photocatalysts with their band gaps, structure, photocatalytic reaction parameters and hydrogen generation has been summarized in Table 3 . B site perovskite is involved in the framework of perovskite oxide structure concluding that B site substituted perovskite structure is more flexible as compared to A site substituted perovskite. Forming solid solution is another approach to modify the band gap of perovskite for enhanced photocatalytic activity and hydrogen production. Solid solution formation is encouraged due to the favorable capacity of ABO3 perovskite to accommodate variety of valences and cations at A site and B site having formula (ABO3)x (A’B’O3)1-x. Solid solutions consist of lowered CB and increased VB edge as the band gap of solid solution is between the band gaps of two materials. In solid solution perovskite, both A and B sites can be occupied with variety of cations. The inappropriate band gap makes some of the perovskites incapable for visible light activity towards H2 production. However, formation of solid solution perovskites is expected to improve photocatalysis under visible irradiation due to tuning of band gap positions with material having single phase [176]. Lv et al. [177], reported that Bi doping into SrTiO3 introduced additional band energy in band gap of SrTiO3 which increased light absorption and acted as an effective donor. Fig. 8 (a, b) shows amount of H2 production by solid state and hydrothermal methods for Bi doped SrTiO3, respectively. Lu et al. [178], indicated that solid solution Sr0·6Bi0·4Ti0·6Fe0·4O3 showed high apparent quantum efficiency for hydrogen production under UV and visible irradiation. The amount of H2 evolution was two times and five times higher than pristine SrTiO3 and BiFeO3, respectively. Moreover, Fe in solid solution of Sr0·6Bi0·4Ti0·6Fe0·4O3 also played an important role in band gap reduction by forming spin polarized band in intrinsic band gap, resulting in enhanced visible light activity. Pan et al. [179], investigated TiOXH/SiOXH-deposited oxynitride LaTaON2 and complex oxide LaMg2/3Ta1/3O3 solid solution with comparable lattice as shown in Fig. 8(c) and indicated its performance for overall water splitting up to 600 nm wavelength. Fig. 8 (d) indicates that water splitting reaction proceeding between amorphous oxyhydroxide and oxynitride or on amorphous oxyhydroxide, preventing N2 evolution. Table 4 summarizes the possible solid solution perovskites as photocatalyst for hydrogen production, taking under consideration the band gaps, structure and reaction parameters. Overall, the change of valence band and conduction band can modify the band structure which is accomplished by formation of solid solution. 3.2.3 Nitridation of perovskite oxide Nitridation of perovskite oxides to form oxynitride ABO2−xN1+x [152] is another approach to decrease band gap of ABO3 perovskite, showing proficient photocatalytic activity under visible light. Anionic substitutions i.e., the partial replacement of oxygen ions by other anions in sub-lattice mostly refer to vacancies, which play an important role in improving photocatalytic activity [184]. Only few elements including fluorine (rF − = 1.3 Å) and nitrogen (rN 3− = 1.5 Å) are utilized for partial substitution of oxygen due to geometrical limitations [82]. Tantalum oxynitride perovskites ATaO2N (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba) are capable of visible light activity. Transition metal oxynitrides having d 0 and d10 orbitals including LaTiO2N, LaNbON2, ANbO2N (A = Ba, Sr, Ca), ATaO2N (A = Ba, Sr, Ca), (Ga1−xZnx)(N1−xOx) and (Zn1+xGe)(N2Ox) have been studied for visible light photoactivity [184]. Partially nitrated compounds offers new structural, chemical and physical properties, which induce more reactivity in oxynitrides as compared to stoichiometric compounds [185]. They have narrow band gap as compared to TiO2 and can be used under visible light, however their band alignment of CB and VB is not much appropriate to carry out redox reaction and also depict faster charge recombination, thus leading to poor efficiency [186]. Generally, oxynitrides are known to be evolved from A site transition metals including W, V, Nb, Mo,Ti, Zr, Ta and B site occupied by rare earth and alkaline earth metals [152]. Mostly, the light absorption of oxynitrides lies within 600–650 nm of visible light range which promote visible light photocatalysis. The visible light absorption of oxynitrides is due to the new energy intermittent level formed due to N 2p orbitals above the valence band edge by O 2p orbitals. Oxynitrides possess a number of potential applications as they are thermally and chemically stable and their application in photocatalysis lies in the fact that appropriate substitutions can easily tune their band gap, thus increasing applications of perovskite-based oxynitrides [185]. The tuning of Ta–O–N system can be carried out by controlling amount of nitrogen to be doped, thus can alter their electrical properties [187]. As compared to pure oxides, the promising ordering of nitrogen and oxygen in oxynitrides offer more structural freedom [188]. For instance, Qi et al. [189], reported that loading BaTaO2N on the surface of Ta3N5 developed Ta3N5/BaTaO2N heterostructure, which encouraged efficient charges separation to get higher efficiency for H2 evolution. Fig. 9 (a) presents the relative band positions of BaTaO2N/Ta3N5 and Fig. 9 (b) shows that BaTaO2N/Ta3N5 remains photochemically stable in cyclic runs over longer period of time. Similarly, CaNbO2N showed increased absorbance of visible light and reduced charge recombination, thus increasing H2 evolution [190]. Oxynitride perovskite photocatalyst LaTiO2N showed enhanced photocatalytic H2 generation under 600 nm of visible light irradiation and was reported as the first oxynitride for photocatalysis [191]. The photocatalytic hydrogen production and photocatalytic parameters of oxynitrides are elaborated in Table 5 . Oxynitride perovskite photocatalysts have been developed and gained attention due to their increased quantum efficiency as the anionic substitution of N controls VB, leading to the advantage of easy tuning of band gap potentials and band gap energy. Although, oxynitrides are under consideration, more research in terms of different properties including defects, doping, and morphology related properties should be focused. Moreover, formation of composite and loading of cocatalyst should also be considered for oxynitrides."
7,Layered perovskites,"3.3 Layered perovskites Although, ABO3 perovskites constitute excellent photocatalytic properties, but layered perovskites are reported to be more novel because of flexible structure in comparison to bulk materials. Layered perovskites exhibit interesting optoelectronic and electronic properties as well as efficient charge transport [195]. Layered perovskite is classified into Aurivillius (AL) phase, Ruddlesden−Popper (RP) phase and Dion-Jacobsen (DJ) phase based on structure as discussed in the following section. 3.3.1 Dion−Jacobson (DJ) phase Dion-Jacobsen (DJ) phase has formula A (Lnn-1TanO3n+1), where, A = K, Rb, Cs, Ag, and Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Sm and n = 2 and 3. Dion-Jacobsen (DJ) phase layered perovskites show extraordinary easy ion exchange, electron conductivity, dielectric properties and photoluminescence [196], however, these layered materials constitute wider band gaps ranging from 3.8 to 4.3 eV, making them active only UV irradiation [197]. Also, these layered structures show improved photocatalytic activity, however, due to limitations of narrow band gap [198], recombination of charge carriers [199] and low visible light harvesting [200], these structures should be improved. These materials can be easily modified as their layered structure allows better distribution of dopant [201]. The efficiency of layered structure can be improved by forming Z-scheme with other materials. The issues in classic photocatalytic systems can be controlled by Z-scheme as it promotes charge separation and redox reactions. Z-scheme mechanism is identical to the natural photocatalysis, where, series linkage of two semiconductors (PS I and PS II) helps retaining of electrons at higher reduction potential and holes at higher oxidation potential involving active sites. All the three types of Z-scheme including direct Z-scheme, Z-scheme with shuttle redox mediator and with solid state electron mediator promote efficient electron transfer. Direct Z-scheme promotes transfer of electrons by direct solid to solid contact. The major difference between Z-scheme with shuttle redox mediator and with solid state electron mediator is the presence of redox couple ions acting as electron transporter and presence of solid electron linker transporting electrons by ohmic contact, respectively [202]. Yet, not many studies are focused on effective charge transfer for photocatalytic H2 production in perovskite through Z-scheme with shuttle redox mediator, solid state electron mediator and direct Z-scheme. Direct Z-scheme system without redox mediators consist of two photocatalysts (SPP I and SPP II). SPP I constitute a higher VB than VB of SPP II, while, SPP II has a CB lower than CB of SPP I for formation of heterojunction. Upon irradiations from light source, recombination of photogenerated electrons from SPP II with holes from SPP I takes place at interface of heterojunction as shown in Fig. 10 (a). The trapping of electrons for reduction and holes for oxidation leads to effective photoactivity. Moreover, it also assists towards hindering of backward reaction as well as minimizes shielding effect. Improved water splitting was studied for SrTiO3:La/Rh in combination with Ir/CoOx/Ta3N5 with 5 times more activity than SrTiO3:Rh [203]. In Z-scheme with redox mediator, two semiconductor perovskite photocatalysts (SPP I and SPP II) are linked together by an acceptor (A) and donor (D) pair rather than physical interaction as shown in Fig. 10 (b). Redox mediators comprise of IO3/I, Co3+/Co2, Fe3+/Fe2+ and NO3/NO2. Light irradiations initiate forward reaction of H2 and O2 generation in particular photosystem. Redox mediator supports the migration of photogenerated electrons from perovskite photocatalyst responsible for O2 production to H2 producing perovskite photocatalyst. Usually, backward reaction takes place in concurrent production of O2 and H2 as the electrons react with the acceptor and donor pair leading to reduce quantity of excited electrons and holes [204]. In a study, water splitting under visible light was achieved by H2 evolving Pt/BaTiO3:Rh and O2 photocatalyst PtOx-loaded WO3 in presence of IO3 −/I− shuttle redox mediator [205]. In another study, photocatalytic water splitting was carried out by H2 evolving BaZrO3–BaTaO2N fabricated by Pt nanoparticles in combination with O2 evolving TiO2 or PtOx/WO3 in the presence of IO3−/I− pair as redox shuttle mediator [206]. In another work, Li et al. [169], investigated LaNi1-xCuxO3 with appropriate amount of Cu2+/Cu1+ redox couples which favored band gap narrowing and also increased the migration time of photo-induced charge carriers from the VB to CB. Z-scheme photocatalytic system with solid electron mediator consist of two semiconductor perovskite photocatalysts (SPP I and SPP II), where solid electron mediator is present at the interface. Improved H2 production has been reported based on the efficient charge carrier's transfer and separation by carbon based rGO and noble metals such as Ag and Au. This type of Z-scheme is formed when one semiconductor perovskite constitutes a more negative CB and more positive VB. Moreover, the noble metals acting as solid electron mediator also induce Surface Plasmon Resonance effect (SPR) for more effective photoactivity. Also, the backward reaction is inhibited by Z-scheme involving solid electron mediator [207]. For instance, Z-scheme with solid state electron mediator has been reported where, rGO transferred photogenerated electrons from BiVO4 acting as O2 generating photocatalyst to Ru/SrTiO3: Rh acting as H2 generating perovskite photocatalyst as shown in Fig. 10 (c). This enhanced visible light water splitting was because of the three times increased charge carries consumption [208]. Detailed information on Z-scheme with redox mediator of perovskites has been included in Sub-section 4.2.1 Graphene and Reduced Graphene Composites. In this perspective, Wei et al. [209], studied the increase in photocatalytic activity of HCa2TaNb3O10 under UV light when intercalated with ZnS and PbS. Fig. 10 (d) illustrates the band gap structure according to band energies of HCa2TaNb2O10, ZnS and PbS which were determined from position of conduction and valence band of the respective semiconductors. It also depicts that the photo-generated electrons in CB of ZnS and PbS were transferred to higher potential CB of HCa2TaNb2O10, while, transferring the holes in VB of HCa2TaNb2O10 to lower potential VB of ZnS, thus facilitating separation of charge carriers. The rate of hydrogen evolution was increased significantly by intercalation of perovskite's interlayer spaces with ZnS and PbS as shown in Fig. 10 (e). Layered Dion−Jacobson phase Rb2La2Ti3O10 was prepared by solid-state method. With substitution of silver cations, there was a decreased in optical band gap sizes and potential active sites on the surface were increased [210]. Wang et al. reported band gap reduction of UV active La2Ti2O7 having band gap of 3.8 eV due to formation of electron donor levels inside the intrinsic band gap of La2Ti2O7 by Rh3+ ions doping [211]. On the whole, HCa2TaNb3O10/(ZnS, PbS) Z-Scheme was observed to produce highest and enhanced rate of H2 production under UV irradiation. This was obviously due to the efficient electron hole pairs separation. Also, Dion−Jacobson layered perovskites like Rb2La2Ti3O10 normally depicts hydration and interlayer space expansion which is responsible for improved H2 production as it allowed proper movement of methanol-water mixture. 3.3.2 Ruddlesden−Popper (RP) phase Layered perovskite can be classified into (100) layered Ruddlesden−Popper phase (RP) having a general formula of An-1A′2BnX3n+1. Here, (100) layered has the interlayer in parallel with (100) plane of a bulk type perovskite structure. Similarly, (110) layered perovskite has a general formula AnBnO3n+2, where, A = Sr, La and B = Ta, Nb, Ti and n = 4, 5. They consist of perovskite slabs, placed parallel to (110) face. The (110) plane structure can be classified further into (111) plane-type structures due to the plane defect structure of perovskite crystal structure having a general formula A5B4O15, where, A = Ba, Sr and B = Nb, Ta. 100). These layered structures have a wide band gap of 3.9–4.1 eV, however, H2 production has been reported to enhance by modification of (100) layered Ruddlesden−Popper phase. For instance, Huang et al. [212], studied nitrogen doping and observed decrease in band gap of K2La2Ti3O10 from 3.69 to 3.44 eV. Composite of Ba5Ta4O15/Ba3Ta5O15 showed 160% higher hydrogen evolution as compared to the pure Ba5Ta4O15 in the presence of Rh. The Ba3Ta5O15 conduction band was located at lower potential than Ba5Ta4O15, thus, photo-excited electrons were effectively transferred from the conduction band of Ba5Ta4O15 to Ba3Ta5O15, resulting in hindered recombination rate and improved photo-activity [213]. Likewise, a network of octahedral La2Ti2O7 doped with Rh-3boosted the mobility of charge carriers which led to higher photocatalytic activity for water splitting and also showed stronger light absorption [214]. In another work, Kim et al. [215], investigated that the doping W6+ into p-type PbBi2Nb2O9 which resulted in increased electron-hole pairs separation and photocatalytic activity due to high electron density. 3.3.3 Aurivillius (AL) phase Aurivillius structures are subgroups of layered perovskite denoted as (Bi2O2)2+(Am−1BmO3m+1)2–. The structure of Aurivillus contains 12-fold coordinated one to three valence A ions in crystal lattice. Whereas, B ion located in octahedron consist of transition ion having high valence. (Bi2O2)2+ layer and number of slabs (denoted by m) determine immense polarization in the structure [218]. Aurivillius structures are observed to show photocatalytic activity, however, wide band gap [219] leading to insignificant visible light photoactivity [220] and electron hole pairs recombination [199] hinders its practical applications. Heterostructured Z-scheme of 2D Bi2WO6 nanosheets with CdS nanowires was studied to improve photoactivity. Fig. 11 (a) depicts the transfer of photoexicted electrons in VB of Bi2WO6 to CB of CdS and further transfer to Pt metal for H2 production reaction by reacting with H+ ions. Photodecomposition oxidation of CH3COH took place on the surface of Bi2WO6. High rate of 1223 μmolg−1h−1 H2 was generated because of sufficient reaction sites and synergistic effect when Bi2WO6/CdS heterostructure was formed as illustrated in Fig. 11 (b) [221]. Similarly, Jiang et al. investigated band gap reduction by co-doping as band gap of pristine Bi3TiNbO9 (3.1eV) was reduced by 1 eV upon Cr/Nb co-doping. The persistence of oxidation state (Cr3+) of Cr also helped in maintaining charge balance. Also, electron hole recombination was minimized by [BiTiNbO7]2− slabs in perovskite structure [222]. Similarly, Zhang et al. reported decreased band gap of Bi4Ti3O12 from 1.81 eV to 1.3eV upon Cr doping to form Bi4Ti3−xCrxO12. This was due to the formation of Cr 3d + Bi 6p + Ti 3d orbital and localized Cr 3d band in CB and middle of band gap of Bi4Ti3O12, respectively [223]. Recent progress in layered perovskite has been summarized in Table 6 . (111) layered structure showed improved activity as the spacing between perovskite layers made diffusion of dopant proficiently. On the whole, Ag and N were found to be the best metal and non-metal respectively to enhance photocatalytic activity."
8,Halide perovskites,"3.4 Halide perovskites Typically, 3D halide perovskite materials have a cubic crystal structure similar to CaTiO3, which can be denoted by formula ABX3, where, A and B are cations and X represents an anion. In ABX3 structure, the eight corners of cube are occupied by A cation with BX6 as corner sharing octahedral complex. Halide perovskites consist of monovalent small cations such as formamidinium (FA), rubidium (Rb), methylammonium (MA) or cesium (Cs) occupying A site in perovskite's structure. B site in structure of perovskite is occupied normally by tin (Sn), germanium (Ge) or lead (Pb), while X site is occupied by halides including Bromine (Br), Chlorine (Cl), Iodine (I) as demonstrated in Fig. 12 (a). The properties of perovskite's crystal structure influencing the electronic and optical properties can be altered notably by varying the constituent elements [234]. A site is normally occupied by MA; CH3NH3 + due to increased symmetry based on its larger size. Moreover, it is also responsible for narrowing band gap leading to increased light absorption. Moreover, FA HC(NH2)2 + on A site results in more symmetry as compared to MA. In this context, FAPbI3 is reported to have 1.4 eV band gap with higher visible light absorption, however, interaction of FA-I ion is reported to be distorted and it also shows poor band alignment [235]. Firstly, CsSnI3 perovskite with Cs+ at A site was reported to have p type semiconductor performance with holes having high mobility [236]. Moreover, in comparison to MA, Cs+ has a smaller size, which causes octahedral tilting leading to less symmetry as well as constitutes a wider band gap. For instance, CsPbI3 has a wide band gap of 1.73 eV in comparison to MAPbI3 with 1.57 eV band gap [237]. Mixing of A site cation can also be carried out in halide perovskite as for the first time Pellet and co-workers reported A site mixing of MA and FA(x) in different ratios to yield (MA)x (FA)1−xPbI3 for optoelectronic applications. In case of B site cations, the stability decreases in order Pb > Sn > Ge, but increase in electronegativity and decrease in band gap is observed in order Ge > Sn > Pb. Thus, mixed B site such as MASn1−xPbxI3 perovskite for solar device applications have been studied with tunable band gap by adjusting ratio of Pb and Sn [238]. X site in perovskite occupied by iodide (I−) leads to stable structure as I− has similar characteristics as Pb and is the most studied perovskite. Chlorine (Cl) at X site has been reported to improve charge carrier's lifetime and diffusion lengths. Bromide (Br) has been reported for band gap tuning of perovskites, but induce structural distortion causing increase in band gap. Likewise fluoride (F) has been observed to induce lattice strain in structure leading to lower light absorption ability [239]. CH3NH3PbI3 is the most commonly studied organic lead perovskite. As shown in Fig. 12 (b), inorganic perovskite originates, when A site in the structure of perovskite is occupied by inorganic species like Cs+ and organic perovskites are formed when A site is occupied by organic specie like CH3NH3 +. Also, A site inorganic species induce spherical symmetry in the structure, while non-spherical symmetry is induced by organic species [240]. Inorganic perovskites comprising of Ti and Ta are effective towards photocatalytic H2 production, however, lack of stability leads to insignificant research on inorganic perovskites [241]. Changes in molar ratio of precursor in organic-inorganic perovskites can be adjusted to tune the structural dimensionality for obtaining structures including 0D (CH3NH3)4PbX62H2O, 1D C5H10NH2PbX3, 2D CnH2n+1NH3PbX4 and 3D CH3NH3PbX3 [242]. Halide perovskites have excellent optoelectronic properties that enable the utilization of the full solar spectrum and efficient charge transportation. Halide perovskites show much longer absorption edge (~700 nm for MAPbI3) than oxide perovskites (~200 nm) or oxynitrides perovskites (~650 nm). This is because of the strong antibonding coupling of s orbitals at B site with p orbital at X site of perovskite's structure [243]. Moreover, halide perovskites are considered for photoactivity based on their high absorption coefficient, long life of charge carriers, short exciton binding energy and stable movement of charge carriers [244–247]. The VB of halide perovskite is dominated by np orbitals of X site, while, the CB is dominated by 6 p orbitals of B site cations. Thus, the VB and CB are not influenced by the A site cations, making halide perovskites easy to be tuned for efficient photocatalytic activity by varying B site and X site ions. Perovskites have been distinguished on the basic of organic and inorganic lead-based perovskites and lead-free perovskites. Lead -based perovskites (B site) are more stable and are show more improved performance as compared to tin (B site) based perovskites. Germanium based perovskites are insignificantly studied due to highly unstable 2+ oxidation state [248]. Thus, organic-inorganic lead-based and lead-free perovskites are discussed in the following Sub-sections. 3.4.1 Lead based halide perovskites Currently, organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites are known to possess extraordinary properties for next-generation hydrogen production applications and are considered as direct band gap perovskite semiconductors [249]. Organic lead trihalide perovskites such as MAPbX3 (MA = CH3NH3 +, X = Br− or I−) has been recognized for applications in light emitting diodes, solar cells, photodetectors and hydrogen production. Other than their wide applications, they are less costly, constitute optical properties that are tunable and show high light absorption [250]. They have band gap ranging from 1.51 to 1.55 eV and show absorption at 820 nm wavelength [237]. However, these materials have intrinsic environmental instability issues [251] due to their dispersion in slurry systems containing water as well as disadvantage of deactivating speedily in the liquid solution [252]. Furthermore, organic lead halides like CH3NH3PbI3 are photocatalysts for water splitting but at the same time has toxicity due to presence of lead. Therefore, resolving stability issues can make halide perovskite an ideal candidate for photo-catalysis. Moreover, resolving toxicity of lead halide perovskites can be useful for efficient photocatalytic H2 production. Hybrid organic-inorganic lead halides show problem of rapid deactivation in liquid solutions, however, this limitation can be resolved using halide perovskite as photosensitizer to directly reduce proton in the liquid solution [249]. In the case of inorganic lead halide CsPbBr3 nanoparticles with Ru@TiO2, electrons were transferred unidirectional from conduction band of CsPbBr3 nanoparticles to conduction band of n-type TiO2, leading to charge separation as shown in Fig. 12 (c). Wu et al. [253], reported that organic lead halide MAPbI3 ie.,CH3NH3PbI3/rGo composite has higher visible light H2 evolution of 960 μmol g−1h−1 as well as it showed good stability in saturated aqueous HI solution by charge transfer process to rGo as illustrated by Fig. 12 (d). Organic lead perovskite MAPbBr3 was stabilized using HBr aqueous solution for visible light photocatalytic H2 generation. Moreover, MAPbBr3 with Pt/Ta2O5 improved the charge carrier migration for enhanced photocatalysis [254]. Likewise, MAPbI3 offers optoelectronic properties, however, on exposure of MAPbI3 with water via hydrogen bonding converts it into (CH3NH3)4PbI6(2H2O) dehydrate or (CH3NH3) PbI3(H2O) monohydrate as hydrated products. Also, it has possibility to be decomposed into MA cation, precipitate of PbI2 and iodide anion. 31 μmol g−1h−1 H2 by MAPbI3 from HI aqueous solution as stabilizer was reported with transition in phase to hydrated phases or PbI2 for effective visible light splitting of HI to I3 – and H2 [255]. In another study, MAPbI3 with TiO2/Pt in HI aqueous solution was investigated for photocatalytic H2 production along with effective transfer of photogenerated electrons. Moreover, vigorous contact was established between MAPbI3 and TiO2/Pt in HI aqueous solution due to dissolution and re-precipitation of MAPbI3 as shown in Fig. 12 (e). MAPbI3 and TiO2/Pt forms a heterojunction in which TiO2/Pt acted as a support for effective photoactivity [256]. 3.4.2 Lead-free halide perovskites Despite of the excellent properties of lead based organic-inorganic perovskites for photocatalytic application, they are known to be detrimental to environment due to the presence of lead. The toxicity and bioavailability of lead also creates major concern in commercial use of lead-based perovskites. Hence, lead-free halide perovskites are under consideration for having outstanding attributes of essential and useful implications. To generate lead-free halide perovskite, homovalent substitution can be carried out by isovalent cations (Sn, Ge), transitions metals (Fe, Mn, Pd, Ni, Cd, Cu), alkaline-earth metals (Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba), and lanthanides (Yb, Tm, Eu). Moreover, for heterovalent substitution involving lanthanides (La, Lu, Dy, Ce, Pr, Tm, Nd, Sm, Er, Eu, Gd), transition metals (Au), main group elements (Tl, Bi, Sb, Te, Bi) and actinides (Bk, Pu, Am) can be utilized. Based on the wide band gap, instability and toxicity, replacement of lead by Sn (II), Sn (IV), In (III), Sb (III), Bi (III), Ag (I) and Cu (II), Ge (II), Mg (II), Ni(II), Co(II), Zn (II) and V (II) has been only been studied as appropriate elements to generate lead-free halide perovskites [257–260]. Lead-free halide perovskites possess remarkable properties including optoelectronic properties and long-life time of charge carriers valuable for photonic application. Moreover, Bi containing halide perovskites are known to show good optoelectronic properties and are stable in ambient air. Also, Sn based halide perovskites show effective charge movement [261]. However, the issue of instability in air of some B site elements (Ge, Sn) in lead-free halide perovskite, which causes oxidation into tetravalent states of elements can be overcome by mixing B site elements such as Bi and Sb [262]. Utilization of lead-free halide perovskites for photocatalytic H2 production is rapidly emerging and most notable study is based on their utilization in photocatalytic water splitting devices with 12.3% efficiency. Still, there is lack of studies focusing on photocatalytic H2 production instead, lead-free halide perovskites are studied largely for use in photovoltaic devices [263]. For instance, bismuth is not a toxic heavy metal, so hybrid metal-organic halide perovskites containing bismuth (Bi3+) are capable for photocatalytic activities [264]. Zhao et al. [265], reported that lead free hybrid when decorated with platinum showed improved charge separation and increased hydrogen evolution. Fig. 12 (f) shows enhanced hydrogen production by [(CH3)2NH2]3 [BiI6] which showed strong optical absorption due to dominant [BiI6]3− inorganic framework. Likewise, pristine (CH₃NH₃)₃Bi₂I₉ showed visible photocatalytic H2 production of 12.91 μmolg−1 h−1, while Pt cocatalyst incorporated (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 showed 14 folds higher H2 production as compared to pristine (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 i.e., 169.21 μmolg−1h−1. It also showed stability up to 70 h from hydriodic acid [266]. MA2CuCl2Br2 was studied as an effective lead-free copper-based perovskite for photocatalytic H2 production. Copper is an earth abundant metal belonging to first-row transition metals. It overcomes the toxicity of lead and is known to be better than Cl− in terms of photochemical properties and instability caused by water [241]. Halide perovskite have distinct advantages, such as structural simplicity, flexibility, and excellent absorption due to X sites but could not be utilized for photocatalytic reactions because of their strong reactivity with water and decomposition by protic solvents due to their strong ionic nature. The dynamic family of halide perovskite can deliver efficient photocatalysis by utilizing emerging idea of dynamic equilibrium for stabilizing halide perovskite. Furthermore, the interface loss, carrier diffusion and charge separation can be future improved for photocatalytic applications."
9,Perovskite composite,"Currently, in photocatalysis for hydrogen production, nanostructured composite with appropriate band structure and visible light activity are highly demanding [267]. Tuning and controlling properties of semiconductor and biomolecular systems as well as introduction of functionalities is possible by manipulating the composite nanostructures precisely [268]. Furthermore, photocatalysis by composites show improved activity due to increase surface area and reactive sites. A number of titanates including SrTiO3, BaTiO3, FeTiO3 and NiTiO3 have great significance and their properties can be tuned by heterojunction composite formation [269–272]. Composites of perovskite with TiO2, g-C3N4 and rGO are studied to form heterojunction for boosting efficient electron transfer. Hydrogen production can be improved by forming heterojunction between perovskite and other materials as it improves charge separation and redox reaction. Heterojunction is formed by the combination of a semiconductor photocatalyst at higher conduction band and other semiconductor at lower conduction band. When irradiated with light, the electrons in semiconductor with higher CB are transferred to semiconductor at lower CB, leaving the holes behind, thus facilitating separation of charge carriers [103]."
10,Titanium based composites,"4.1 Titanium based composites Over past 40 years, TiO2 is the only prominent photocatalyst utilized for photocatalytic applications [273]. In current years, TiO2 has also been a significant part of reported cocatalyst systems including SiC, WO3, CuOx, Cu(OH)2, NiO, Ni(OH)2, CdS, and Si etc [274–282]. Easy fabrication by in-situ reaction, insignificant mismatch of lattice near the interface and increased chemical stability makes TiO2/titanate heterojunction more advantageous as compared with other cocatalyst systems [283–285]. Also, TiO2 is considered largely for commercial scale hydrogen generation. This is because of its unique photochemical properties, chemical stability, high oxidation power to mineralize a lot of organic molecules, its abundance and nontoxicity [286,287]. Moreover, due to the high chemical stability, TiO2 is known as an effective photocatalyst in splitting of H2O for evolution of H2 and O2. However, zero-dimensional nanostructured TiO2 show low photocatalytic efficiency [288]. This is due to the low ability of TiO2 to harvest UV-light due to wide band gap (~3.2 eV), easy charge recombination and the deficiency of active sites on surface, which leads to low quantum efficiency [289,290]. Enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2 composites with perovskites have been demonstrated in various reports. The nanocomposites improved the absorption of solar radiation as well as allowed scavenging of charges [291]. For instance, Fig. 13 (a, b) illustrates that TiO2 and NiTiO3 are n-type semiconductors, with conduction band edges near to water reduction potential. Moreover, charge separation was accomplished during movement of electrons from TiO2 to NiTiO3 in their n-n interface and by accumulated electrons in space charge region [289]. Strontium titanate (SrTiO3) is known as active photocatalyst for water splitting and is a multi-metal oxide with cubic perovskite structure having a band gap of 3.2 eV. The conduction band of SrTiO3 is more negative than TiO2. Suppressing recombination of electron hole pairs was investigated by coupling SrTiO3 with TiO2. Un-doped intrinsic n-type TiO2 has a fermi level which lies at the minimum of its CB range. Thus, the negative shift in Fermi level to more negative redox potential compared to H+/H2 (0 V vs NHE) increased the hydrogen production due to less hydroxide ions produced as compared to pristine TiO2 and SrTiO3. Two semiconductors of unequal band gaps, formed an exceptional heterojunction at the p-n junction i.e., interface where the p-type acceptor perovskite compound (SrTiO3) and n-type TiO2 connect electronically, which acted as trap for the photogenerated electrons and facilitated interfacial electron transfer. In the case of heterojunction, the electrons flowed through p-n junction to the conduction band of TiO2. Improved photocatalytic water splitting was due to spatial interparticle charge separation favored by the flow of charges through the p-n junction and the highly stable reduced states of TiO2/SrTiO3, which were even stable under oxygen saturated conditions [283]. Moreover, the formation of composite SrTiO2/TiO2 and its doping with nickel introduced a new acceptor impurity energy level above the valence band. This reduced band gap shifted the light absorption into visible light region. Electron hole recombination was reduced by Ni3+ doping as it trapped the photogenerated electrons, transferred the excited electrons to the adsorbed water and induced oxygen vacancies. Fig. 13 (c) depicts electron transfer mechanism in heterojunction of SrTiO2/TiO2 and role of nickel in reducing electron hole recombination [292]. Similarly, it is demonstrated that the heterojunction of TiO2/porous BiFeO3 (P–BFO) showed ability for water reduction. Porous BiFeO3 showed negligible H2 generation from the water methanol mixture even with Pt cocatalyst. However, the activity is obvious after coupling with nanocrystalline TiO2. When T/P–BFO nanocomposite in proper mole ratio i.e., 9% TiO2 was irradiated under visible light, the photogenerated high energy electrons transferred thermodynamically to TiO2 conduction band. In this way separation of photogenerated charges was improved (Fig. 13 (d)). When heterojunction is formed between TiO2 and BFO, their Fermi energy levels descended and electric field was formed at the interface of the nanocomposite heterojunction. Due to interface electric field, a negative charge appeared on junction face of BiFeO3, while positive charge appeared on face junction of TiO2 at equilibrium position. Thus, the charge carrier recombination was significantly reduced, leading to the enhanced photocatalytic activity [293]. Table 7 summarizes the detailed photocatalytic reaction parameters and hydrogen evolution rates on recent research of perovskite composites with TiO2 as heterojunction for improved photocatalytic activity. On the whole, the formation of heterojunctions between perovskite and TiO2 can reduce the problems of wide band gap and charge recombination. Moreover, red shift in light absorption spectrum and alteration of charge transfer can be noticed as the composite of TiO2 with perovskite can tune electronic structures."
11,Carbon based perovskite composites,"4.2 Carbon based perovskite composites Since many decades, 1 D and 2D carbon-based nanomaterials are known as a noteworthy class of materials widely utilized for clean energy production including hydrogen from solar energy. Carbon is abundantly available on earth and since last two eras carbon-based compounds including graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), graphene (GO), reduced graphene (rGO) and carbon nanotubes have been explored for their application as supercapacitors, biosensors, fuel cells and energy storage [24,37]. Furthermore, they have been utilized for catalysis process. Generally, 1D and 2D carbon-based materials offer outstanding optical and electrical properties, are non-toxic, environmental friendly and are abundant [20,297]. Currently, the utilization of carbon based compounds in composite with perovskites for photocatalysis is considerably explored as they are capable of enhancing the reaction for H2 production by increasing active sites for sacrificial agent, by acting as electron acceptor and by acting as a mediator for charge carriers leading to separation of electron hole pairs [29,298]. Moreover, they are known to decrease agglomeration of particles through improving dispersion by acting as host matrix with semiconductor photocatalyst [299]. Heterojunctions of perovskites with carbon based compounds including rGO, GO and g-C3N4 has been widely studied for improvement of photocatalytic H2 production [300] and has been systematically discussed in next sections. 4.2.1 Graphene and reduced graphene composite Chemical modification by oxidation and exfoliation of graphene (allotrope of C) accompanied by extensive modification of the basal plane forms GO. GO is a monolayer with high oxygen content, characterized by C/O ratio less than 3:1 and typically closer to 2:1 [301]. Honeycomb structure of graphene induces many extraordinary properties. Graphene has large surface area (2620 m2/g), high transparency, excellent charge mobility [302,303], exciting electronic and photonic properties for various applications such as energy storage, photovoltaics, photoelectrochemical and photocatalysis [303,304]. The two-dimension cycle planer structure of graphene enables it to act as an exceptional catalyst carrier [305]. In addition, the transfer of electrons from the conduction band of semiconductor to graphene is also favored by the intimate interfacial contact between photocatalyst and graphene [306]. Currently, graphene is considered and recognized as more portable and flexible for energy applications aimed at future energy needs [307]. The combination of perovskite photocatalysts with graphene has been depicted as an efficient way for suppressing recombination by separating electron hole pairs [308] and enhancing photocatalytic activity [309]. In composites with graphene, an increased number of electrons and holes are involved in the photocatalytic reaction as graphene acts as an electron acceptor and capture electrons readily [310]. Fig. 14 (a) illustrates that the oxidation/exfoliation of graphite gives bulk solid graphene oxide (GO) and its reduction through various chemical, thermal or electrochemical processes increase the interlayer spaces and functionalize the basal planes, giving reduced graphene (rGO) [311]. It has also been recognized as a solid-state mediator for enhanced charge separation. Moreover, loading rGO on the semiconductors acts as a cocatalyst to catalyze reactions for hydrogen evolution [312]. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is a 2D non-metallic carbon material with conductive properties. It is ideal for photocatalysis due to its large surface area, light transmittance, chemical stability and outstanding electron capture and transport [313]. However, the properties relating to conductivity of rGO are not exploited completely. The advantages of doping rGO with semiconductors are: (i) it assists improvement in the separation of the photogenerated charges; (ii) enhances utilization of charges in photocatalytic process; (iii) maintain the structural integrity of composite even after repeated use. Moreover, preparation of composites with rGO is also known to be environmental friendly [314]. In rGO based composites, the semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) are typically distributed on the surface of rGO sheets [315,316]. Strong interaction between rGO and semiconductor nanoparticles in rGO encapsulated nanostructures makes it a remarkable transporter of charge carriers and induces molecular diffusion property. These properties were implied practically in crumpled graphene nano reactors, in which chemical reaction took place in small nano-spaces for improved stability and catalytic activity [317]. LaFeO3 (LFO) is an ABO3 type perovskite, exhibiting water splitting properties, but wide band gap and poor lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers limit its use as a photocatalyst. LFO nanospheres were prepared by sol-gel combustion method. Further, LFO spheres were fabricated on 1 wt% rGO surface through ultrasonication. Reduced graphene oxide acted as a cocatalyst under visible light to improve photocatalysis as compared to LFO without rGO. During excitation, the electrons jumped from the valence band of LFO to the conduction band, leaving holes in the valence band. After that, the photogenerated electrons from CB of LFO were transferred to graphene sheets where they participated in H2 evolution reaction. This was possible because of the superior interfacial interaction between rGO sheet and LFO nanosphere through the self-assembly tactic and exclusive ability of the rGO [318]. SrTiO3-rGO composite exhibited higher photocatalytic activity in methanol solution than pristine SrTiO3. The simple one pot hydrothermal technique was used to synthesize SrTiO3-rGO composite. Composite with uniform morphology was prepared via facile one pot hydrothermal method by 0.8% rGO and showed improved activity. Fig. 14 (b) shows that under UV irradiation, the electrons in VB of SrTiO3 were excited to the CB, generating holes in the VB. The rGO sheets and Pt nanoparticles in the SrTiO3-rGO composite acted as electron acceptors. On the other hand, the rGO not only acted as a charge acceptor but also served as a scaffold to improve dispersion of SrTiO3 [319]. The NiTiO3/5 wt% Go (NTG) composite has been observed for improved activity as it showed larger surface area than pristine NiTiO3 (NTG). On increasing graphene content, visible light absorbance of composite was enhanced. Increased surface area resulted in improvement towards adsorption-desorption of reactants and products in photocatalytic reaction. Fig. 14 (c) shows that excited electrons migrated from the valence band of NiTiO3 (NTG) to the conduction band of NiTiO3 and then moved to graphene sheet. This mechanism prevented recombination of electrons and holes and indicated extended lifetime of charge carriers in NTG, which enhanced photocatalytic activity. Fermi level of graphene i.e., −0.08 V was slightly lower than the conduction band potential of NiTiO3 i.e., −0.53 V, which facilitated the transfer of photoexcited electrons. This shows that graphene acted as an outstanding conductor as well as electron acceptor. Fig. 14 (d) indicates NiTiO3 containing different wt. % of graphene and reduced size of semicircles indicates less resistance in charge transfer, allowing rapid separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. Increased charge carrier transfer rate between the photocatalyst and solution depends on the sp2 πconjugated domains [320]. Similarly, Bi2WO6/graphene composites with doped Ag also showed enhanced photocatalysis due to improved light absorption, decreased band gap of the composite and separation of photogenerated electron hole pairs. The composite of KNbO3/rGO integrated with cocatalyst was an efficient way to improve the charge mobility and separation efficiency of electron and hole pairs [224,321]. Facile self-assembly photocatalytic reduction method was implied to synthesize reduced graphene oxide (rGO) encapsulated LaNiO3 (LNO-rGO) composites. Fig. 14 (e) illustrates meso-macroporous framework of the prepared LNO-5% rGO composite. This restricted the electron hole recombination and the electrons rapidly flowed along Ni–C bond to rGO sheets, helping migration of electrons from the surface of LNO to rGO. Moreover, the meso-macroporous framework of crumpled nano-reactor also promoted capturing of photogenerated holes by diffusion and as well as adsorption of molecules of methanol into nano-reactors. Meanwhile, H2 was formed by the reaction of electrons adsorbed H2O molecules and the products spilled over from the nano-reactor through mesoporous structure. More than this, during the whole long recycling process, the nano-reactor showed exceptional stability. This made it possible for rGO and LNO to develop a strong interaction among them [322]. Layered perovskite, Sr2Ta2O7 has a wide band gap of 3.0–4 eV due to which it is only active under UV irradiation but Sr2Ta2O7 doping with nitrogen minimized the band gap thus, allowing visible light absorption. The composite of Sr2Ta2O7-xNx with GO showed charge carrier transportation as the GO acted as “highway” to transport electrons to the cocatalysts i.e., platinum. The electrons in CB of Sr2Ta2O7-xNx were injected into GO sheets. Due to high charge carrier mobility of graphene, the electrons were mobilized on the graphene sheet. The Pt nanoclusters decorated on the graphene surface acted as active sites for hydrogen evolution. The presence of graphene suspended in solution reduced the possible recombination. The highest H2 production in graphene composites was achieved using 5% GO/Sr2Ta2O7-xNx. Quantum efficiency was 6.45, which was 80% more than using pristine Sr2Ta2O7 [323]. Recent advancements in carbon-based perovskite composites with rGO for improved photocatalytic hydrogen production have been listed in Table 8 . LiFeO3/rGO showed highest photocatalytic H2 production under visible irradiation. 1 wt% rGO in the composite acted as an electron sink, promoted efficient charge separation. Moreover, it narrowed the composite's band gap as well as enhanced adsorption due to large surface area of rGO. Activity was enhanced because H2 evolution reaction occur ed on both LiFeO3 and rGO sheet. The sol gel method for the preparation of LFO nanospheres and ultrasonication process for fabrication of LiFeO3 on rGO sheets also contributed to enhanced activity due to better anchoring of LiFeO3 nanoparticles."
12,Graphitic carbon nitride composite,"4.3 Graphitic carbon nitride composite Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a non-metal polymeric carbon-based semiconductor having layered structure. It has band gap 2.7 eV and shows visible light response up to wavelength 460 nm and is a metal free photocatalyst for hydrogen production [327,328]. Moreover, other than its band gap, other properties which makes g-C3N4 suitable for water splitting [329,330] are its simple preparation, low cost, pollution free feature and high chemical stability [331]. Under visible light irradiation, g-C3N4 shows outstanding photocatalytic activity owing to its electron richness and basic surface functionalities [33] as well as stability in water splitting for hydrogen evolution [9,332,333]. At the same time, rapid electron-hole pairs recombination and moderately small surface area are some shortcomings of g-C3N4 [330,334,335]. Nickel titanate (NiTiO3) with a band gap of 2.18 eV shows good visible light photocatalytic activity, however, the CB level of NiTiO3 is not more negative than hydrogen evolution level (E=H2/H2O) to initiate hydrogen production, thus it shows no photocatalytic performance. The heterojunction between g-C3N4 and NiTiO3 showed photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. The electrons transfer from the CB of g-C3N4 to the CB of NiTiO3 did not occurred because of the inner electric field, but the transfer of holes from the VB of g-C3N4 to the VB of NiTiO3 was stimulated. This resulted in longer lifetime of the photogenerated electrons and holes, separation of the photo generated electron hole pairs and enhanced photocatalytic activity [336]. Similarly, AgNbO3 is also a perovskite active under visible light due to its moderate band gap (2.8 eV). Unfortunately, the photoactivity is limited by fast charges recombination. Separation of charge carrier was successfully obtained by developing composite of AgNbO3/g-C3N4, resulting in enhanced production of hydrogen under visible light. Improved photocatalytic activity was observed using AgNbO3/g-C3N4 prepared via microwave heating method. Using this method, g-C3N4 was not decomposed and this approach was also useful in improving crystallinity. Improved electron transfer was obtained due to chemical bonds which were formed at the interface and helped to decrease surface energy. On the basis of matched band position of the two semiconductors, heterojunction was constructed between them. Fig. 15 illustrates that the inner electric field in the heterojunction transferred electrons from g-C3N4 to the CB of AgNbO3. At the same time, the holes in AgNbO3 migrated to the VB of g-C3N4. Sacrificial agent i.e., methanol consumed the holes in g-C3N4, while accumulated electrons in the CB of AgNbO3 were transferred to Pt nanoparticles and H+ was reduced to H2 [337]. Likewise, Fig. 15 (b and c) illustrates charge transfer and photocatalytic mechanism in heterojunction for g-C3N4 with KCa2Nb3O10 nanosheets and KCa2Ta3O10 Dion-Jacobson perovskite, respectively. KCa2Nb3O10 and KCa2Ta3O10 were not active under visible light but, when heterojunction was formed with g-C3N4, the electrons were excited from the VB to the CB of g-C3N4 nanosheets, leaving electropositive holes in the VB of respective perovskite. This transfer of photogenerated electrons from g-C3N4 nanosheets to KCa2Nb3O10 nanosheets was because of more negative CB edge potential of g-C3N4 (−1.12 eV) than the CB edge potential of KCa2Nb3O10(-0.784 eV) and KCa2Nb3O10 [338]. So, due to more positive VB edge of the g-C3N4 (1.59 eV) the photogenerated holes were left in the VB of g-C3N4 and were consumed for water oxidation. Heterojunction composite Ca2Nb2TaO10/g-C3N4 showed good hydrogen production from aqueous methanol solution under visible light. Hybridization of two-dimensional nanostructured materials (Ca2Nb2TaO10/g-C3N4 bulk) constituted a specific surface area of 7.56 m2/g, while, the Ca2Nb2TaO10/g-C3N4 nanosheets has a specific surface area of 43.81 m2/g. Transfer of photoinduced charge carriers and suppression of electron hole pairs recombination was accomplished by the heterostructured photocatalyst as depicted in Fig. 16 (a). Fig. 16 (b) indicates UV/Vis diffuse reflection spectra, which indicates that g-C3N4 is visible light active, but Ca2Nb2TaO10 is UV light active photocatalyst. The g-C3N4/Ca2Nb2TaO10 nanosheet composite showed sharper absorption in the visible region. The activity of nanosheets was about 2 times higher than bulk because of the synergic properties of increased surface area and the quantum confinement effect, which increased the ability of redox potential of generated charges on g-C3N4 based composite [341]. Furthermore, heterojunction of g-C3N4/SrTa2O6 showed remarkable activity for hydrogen evolution as shown in Fig. 16 (c). Similarly, g-C3N4/CaTiO3 (Fig. 16 (d)) and g-C3N4/KCa2Ta3O10 heterojunction improved visible light photocatalytic activity because of narrowed band edges and intimate contact between perovskite and g-C3N4, which reduced the interface energy and imporved electron transfer [342,343]. Pertinent hydrogen evolution by carbon-based perovskite composite with g-C3N4 through photocatalytic reaction is summarized in Table 9 . Dion-Jacobson phase Ca2Nb2TaO10 showed highest visible light photocatalytic activity for composite with g-C3N4 because of the synergistic effect as well as due to intimate interfacial connections between g-C3N4 nanosheets and Ca2Nb2TaO10 nanosheets. The cascading electrons proved to be efficient in suppressing charge recombination and improving photocatalytic H2 evolution performance."
13,Other perovskite composites,"4.4 Other perovskite composites Heterojunction formation of perovskites with noble metal free narrow band gap (2.4 eV) CdS is rarely studied, but is known to improve photocatalytic H2 production by improvement of visible light activity and interfacial charge transfer. Moreover, the water reduction potential of CdS is thermodynamically feasible as CdS constitutes a more negative CB than the H2O/H2 reduction potential [345]. For instance, visible light photoactiviry of layered La2Ti2O with CdS and black phosphor quantum dots (QDs) was observed to generate 960 μmolg−1h−1 of H2. The enhanced activiry was obviously due to the appropriate band alignment of CdS, strong electron donating ability of CdS, electron relay and boosted light absorption [346]. Likewise, heterostucture of SrTiO2 with CdS has been investigated for enhanced H2 production due to efficient charge transfer and separation [347]. In another development, CdS, Bi2S3 QDs co-decorated KNbO3 composite scheme also showed photocatalytic activity in visible range 420–520 nm, respectively [348]. HSr2Nb3O10 nanosheets coupled CdS heterojunction was reported for improved activity because of increased surface area, improved charge separation and light absoprtion [349]. Moreover, up conversion effect of doped luminescent agents is also been studied for improvement of photoctalytic activity. For instace, improved visible light absoprtion and boosted H2 generation was investigated for Er3+:Y3Al5O12/KNbO3 [133] and dual substituted Eu3+ in bulk NaTiO3 [350]. Doping of erbium (Er+) in SrTiO3 was also studied for improved visible light absoprtion. This was due to Er3+ intraband transition absorption and elevated energy excited state of Er3+. It also conserved energy to carry out redox reactions and improved charge sepration [351]. Other perovskite based heterojunctions were also reported for efficient photocatalytic H2 production under visible light including LaCoO3/SnO2 [352], Ru doped and Fe2O3 coupled LaFeO3 perovskite [353]. Efficeint light absorption, improved charge transfer and reduced charge recombination was observed for PbTiO3/LaCrO3 [354] and LaCoO3/SnO2 p-n heterojuntion. Improved photocatalytic activity was also reported for layered Bi2WO3 heterojunction with BiOCl [355] and Bi2S3 QDs co-decorated KNbO3 composite scheme which showed photocatalytic activity in visible range 420–520 nm [356]. Overall, the hetrojunction formation has of CdS with perovskites is an advantagious way of fabricating wide bad gap perovskites for improved visible light photoactivity. The narrow gap, charge separation, appropriate band aligment and thermodynamicaaly appropriate reducction potential induces effective photocatalytic H2 production in perovskites. Also, luminescent agents located in distorted BO6 to the host perovskite ions with B site octahedra to develop a internal electric field is responsible for the efficjnet charge tarnsfer for boosted H2 production."
14,Conclusions and future perspective,
15,Conclusions,"5.1 Conclusions Photocatalytic hydrogen production by perovskite is considered to be the best-known renewable energy production technique by utilizing light and water to meet the growing energy demand without compromising the future energy demand. Moreover, hydrogen energy by photocatalysis is recognized to be sustainable energy because of its zero environmental impact and can be generated easily by non-replenished sources. Moreover, photocatalysis is also known to be cost effective and environmentally friendly H2 generating technique. In this perspective, the review presents an overview of perovskites, mechanism for hydrogen production, thermodynamics analysis and different approaches in improving efficiency of perovskite for sustainable hydrogen production. In general, perovskites are most demanding semiconductors belonging to very important family of materials and exhibit exceptional characteristics in photocatalytic application. Different modification approaches such as doping with non-metals, substituting A or B site of ABO3 perovskite, formation of solid solution, incorporation of nitrogen into the perovskite lattice as well as formation of composites has been discussed. • The introduction of metals forming appropriate Schottky barrier and noble metals showing SPR effect into perovskite can lead to increase in activity for hydrogen production. Similarly, non-metal anion doping is more preferred approach for boosting visible light activity of perovskites. Metal doping contributes in narrowing of band gap and reduction of charge carrier recombination. • The flexible structure of perovskite allows A site substitution, B site substitution, solid solution formation and nitridation of perovskite oxide, which are considered efficient approaches to improve photocatalytic activity. Halide perovskite have reasonable band gap for visible light activation, but show recombination, decomposition and stability issues in photocatalysis applications. • Composite formation by combining perovskite with other semiconductors i.e., TiO2 to construct heterojunction promotes charge carrier separation towards boosting H2 evolution. Moreover, carbon-based perovskite composites of g-C3N4 and rGO are also capable of maximizing efficiency for production under visible light irradiation by heterojunction formation and by formation of Z-scheme systems, respectively."
16,Future prospective,"5.2 Future prospective • Perovskite semiconductors have a great potential in photocatalytic water splitting, but the knowledge of perovskite semiconductors working under visible light range is still not up-to-date, leading to limited large-scale applications. Further research should be carried out on band gap tuning and band adjustment of perovskites for overcoming future energy needs. Moreover, they have limited practical applications due to issues in stability, cost and charge transfer and separation, redox reaction and efficiency, which remains a challenge. With the aid of appropriate approaches to construct heterojunction composite, proper selection of sacrificial reagents and efficient design of photoreactor can be employed to overcome such problems. In spite of the band gap engineering for efficiency improvement, wide and mismatched band gaps of semiconductor perovskites are still a challenge. In depth investigation is required for overcoming stability and toxicity related issues of halide perovskites. These perovskites can be coupled with green clays such as montmorillonite (MMT) and bentonite (Bt) due to their 2D layered structure, higher sorption capacity and provides efficient charge separation with good stability in multiple cycles. Besides, with the use of MAX phase and MXenes multilayers materials coupled with perovskite, higher light absorption with enhanced photoactivity and stability could be achieved. • Detailed understanding on photoactivity dependence on morphology and retrieval of photocatalyst is also lacking. Improvement of dynamic conditions for photoactivity for molecular catalyst needs considerable attention as numerous molecular photocatalysts like halide perovskites are inappropriate for utilizing in aqueous medium i.e., water. The immobilization of photocatalyst on solid support such as mesh, monolithic and FTO supports are recognized as effective strategies for overcoming these issues and also help in the recovery and reusability of catalyst. However, the use of water as proton source without the help of sacrificial agent is still a challenge. These can be overcome with controlled environment such as temperature, sacrificial reagent concentration, catalyst loading and interaction between light source and catalyst. The controlled light intensity, gas phase photocatalytic systems and batch/continuous processes are also promising to provide detailed information about the photoactivity and stability to catalysts. • Moreover, there is need to investigate the effect of photoreactors to improve catalyst activity with higher harvesting of light and improved stability in multiple cycles. Adequate and precise photoreactors are in need for improved photocatalytic process, depending on the requirements and conditions of photocatalytic mechanism. Also, quantum efficiency calculations for photocatalytic H2 production are rarely studied, thus, attentions should be given to evaluate the flux of light being consumed and amount of hydrogen produced. More importantly, there are limited reports available highlighting the evolution of products other than hydrogen to understand the role of perovskites and their composites on yield rates and selectivity. The detailed information about reaction mechanism, reaction kinetics and thermodynamics analysis can further contribute to maximize catalyst photoactivity and products selectivity under UV and visible light irradiations. This work provides enough guidance for understanding mechanism of photocatalysis by perovskites and future research is recommended to develop an effective perovskite composite integrated with efficient photoreactor system for enhanced efficiency for H2 evolution."
