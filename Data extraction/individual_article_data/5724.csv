0,Introduction,"For the production of fine and specialty chemicals, development of new efficient solid catalysts is one of the most important topics in academic research [1]. Catalytic reactions have to proceed with increasing atom-economy to minimize cost and waste under environmentally benign “green” conditions [2,3]. One of the cornerstones in catalysis is the selective oxidation of alcohols, in particular methanol, for the production of e.g. plastics, detergents, paints, cosmetics, food additives and drug intermediates [4,5]. Traditional catalysts are noble metals (Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd etc.) in the form of nanoparticles dispersed on suitable supports [1,4,6–12]. Unfortunately, the complexity of the catalytic systems under reaction conditions renders a straight forward prediction of reactivity and selectivity often impossible. Model studies on well-defined surfaces under ultrahigh vacuum conditions can guide the design of catalysts as they provide insights into the fundamental reactivity of catalytic surfaces. Studies on pre-oxidized Au single crystalline surfaces already provide a framework of reactivity for the oxidation of alcohols, aldehydes, and amines [13–16]. However, in gas phase oxidation reactions using gold nanoparticle catalysts, the interface between the particle and the reducible oxidic support material was observed to provide active centers, e.g., for oxygen activation [17,18]. This scenario, indeed, is not easily reflected by model reactions on pre-oxidized gold surfaces. This so called pressure and material gap was recently overcome for gas phase reactions by a bulk-nanostructured gold material, the nanoporous gold (npAu) [19–21]. The sponge-like network of about 30nm large ligaments provides an extended almost pure and strongly curved gold surface. This material could, hence, be used to bridge the gap between the model studies and more complex traditional supported catalysts, in sense of a scale up. Since its first discovery as an active catalyst for CO oxidation in 2006 [22] a number of studies revealed that with respect to the activation of molecular oxygen from the gas phase traces of Ag [23,24] and a large fraction of low coordinated surface sites similar to 5nm large particles [25] are critical. Gas phase catalytic studies on the oxidation of primary alcohols over npAu provided a pattern of reactivity and a mechanistic understanding on the molecular level [19,20,26–28]. Key to the reactivity of the gold surface is surface bonded oxygen which reacts as a Brønstedt base and abstracts the alcoholic proton. The resulting surface bonded alcoxy species can undergo further hydrogen elimination yielding the surface bonded aldehyde. This step was found to be rate limiting and determines the selectivity of the reaction. So far, there is no comparative study on the reactivity for this type of reaction in the condensed, i.e., liquid phase using npAu. Not only that the application range in liquid phase is much broader, the vast majority of studies on supported gold catalysts for alcohol oxidation are performed in liquid phase [6,30]. As compared to gas phase catalysis physicochemical parameters, such as the solubility of oxygen, slower diffusion and adsorption due to solvation typically lead to a very different activity. Also, the chemical reactivity of the solid/liquid interface can be quite different than the solid/gas interface [31,32]. In this study we investigate the oxidation of methanol and ethanol over nanoporous gold catalysts with the emphasis on the liquid phase. Because of their relatively high vapor pressure, both alcohols can be investigated under “mild” conditions, i.e., at temperatures well below 100°C for vapor and liquid phase reactions, making a comparison under both conditions possible. Studies by Hutchings et al. demonstrated that operating at low temperatures (<110°C) is essential for high product selectivity in case of methanol oxidation [29]. Using a continuously stirred batch reactor and a plug flow reactor we investigate the activity and selectivity of the self and cross coupling of these alcohols under various conditions (temperature and oxygen concentration), trying to establish a pattern of reactivity and deduce a molecular mechanism of transformation. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) before and after catalytic experiments is used to gain information on the surface roughness, number of low coordinated sites and the structure (ligament size) of the npAu catalysts."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Synthesis of nanoporous gold (npAu),"2.1 Synthesis of nanoporous gold (npAu) Ingots of the master alloy, with nominal composition of Au25Ag75 (numbers denoting atomic percent), were prepared by arc melting the constituents (Au 99.995%, Ag 99.999%). The ingots were sealed in evacuated quartz tubes and homogenized at 920°C for 120h. Sheets were then formed by cold-rolling to a thickness off 0.125mm, followed by a recovery anneal at 620°C for3h in air. Laser cutting into circular discs, 5mm in diameter, completed the master alloy preparation. NpAu catalysts were obtained by corrosion of such master alloy discs. For potentiostatic dealloying (potentiostat BioLogic SP-200), a typical three electrode system consisting of a gold wire formed as a basket to hold the Au25Ag75 alloy discs was employed as working electrode, as well as a platinum auxiliary electrode and a platinum quasi reference electrode. This method avoids any potential contamination over time by, e.g., chloride as was observed for standard reference electrodes such as a Ag/AgCl electrode. The etching process was performed at 60mV in 5M nitric acid (HNO3, Sigma-Aldrich, ≥65%) at room temperature. The potential was applied till the anodic current became negligibly small (24h) corresponding to removal of over 99at.% Ag (calculation based on the measured charge, see also Fig. S1)."
3,Characterization of npAu,"2.2 Characterization of npAu For quantitative analysis of residual Ag content in npAu, Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS 5 FL, Jena Analytik) was carried out as described in previous publications [33]. The homogenous distribution of residual Ag through the npAu disc was checked by Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, Bruker XFlash 6 | 30). For determination of the specific microscopic surface area of npAu with Eq. (1), cyclic voltammograms of npAu samples in 0.5M sulfuric acid (H2SO4, VWR Chemicals, 95%) between −0.4V and 1.7V were recorded using a scan rate of 10 to 1mVs−1 (potentiostat BioLogic SP-200), a gold wire with fixed npAu as working electrode, a platinum counter electrode and a commercial Ag/AgCl (in 3M KCl) reference electrode. (1) A m = IE v ∗ Q ref ∗ m ( npAu ) IE: integrated area of Au-reduction peak in AV v: sweep velocity (1–10Vs−1) Qref: gold oxide monolayer charge is 400µCcm−2 [34] m(npAu): weight of npAu (10–15mg) Structural characterization of npAu samples was carried out by scanning electron miscroscopy (SEM, Zeiss Supra 40). From these images sizes of ligaments and pores were determined by measuring 400 diameters each. For structural characterization of the npAu by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thin, electron transparent lamellas were cut from the npAu discs with a Focused Ion Beam (FIB) using a FEI Nova 200 FIB. Subsequent TEM measurements have been performed in the bright field mode using parallel illumination on a FEI Titan 80/300 (S)TEM microscope equipped with a Cs-corrector for the objective lens. Micrographs were taken to compare npAu before and after catalytic experiments with respect to size distribution, atomic distances between surface steps, crystallinity and contaminations."
4,Catalytic oxidation of primary alcohols on npAu in liquid phase,"2.3 Catalytic oxidation of primary alcohols on npAu in liquid phase Liquid phase oxidation reactions were carried out in a batch reactor (AmAr Equipments PVT. Ltd., Mumbai; reaction volume of 60–450mL, see Scheme 1 ). The temperature of the reactor and pressure of gas phase were controlled by installed thermocouple and pressure gauges. To ensure an optimal gas-liquid contact, a self-gassing hollow shaft stirrer was used. In this way the gas was continuously dispersed in the liquid to ensure fast equilibration of dissolved oxygen. The reactor was filled with 60mL of an alcohol (methanol MeOH, VWR Chemicals, 99.8%; ethanol EtOH, VWR Chemicals, 100%) or alcohol diluted with high purity water, another alcohol or acetaldehyde (AcH, ​Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.5%). The npAu discs (10–15mg) were mounted in a metallic net basket inside the reactor to avoid catalyst mechanical damage during catalytic experiments. After loading and sealing the reactor was purged with nitrogen (Linde 5.0) and oxygen (Linde 5.0) twice, and subsequently pressurized and heated to the designated temperature. After 24h, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and analyzed. Each experiment was repeated at least four times."
5,Analysis of oxidation products in liquid phase,"2.4 Analysis of oxidation products in liquid phase Reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography equipped coupled with a mass spectrometer (GC/MS, Agilent 5975C, inert XL MSD, column INNOPEG 1000). Commercial chemicals of each product (methyl formate MeFm, Alfa Aesar, 97%; acetaldehyde AcH, Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.5%; methyl acetate MeOAc, Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.8%; ethyl acetate EtOAc, Merck KGaA, ≥99.8%) were used as external standards and calibration. Due to similar standard curves of MeOAc and EtOAc, the formed amount of the oxidation products 1,1-dimethoxyethane (MeO)2Et and 1-ethoxy-1-methoxyethane (EtO)(MeO)Et were determine with the same standard. The GC/MS detection limits were 0.03mmol for MeFm, 0.004mmol for AcH, 0.01mmol for MeOAc and 0.02mmol for EtOAc. As reaction products can be also contained in the gas phase due to their specific vapor pressure gaseous samples were also analyzed using the same setup which was equipped with a gas injection valve. Results are included as possible sources of error in data, respectively. The oxidation product CO2 was analyzed quantitatively with Gas Chromatography (GC, Hewlett Packard 6650) equipped with a Supleco PLOT 1010 column (530 µm i.d.×30m) with a detection limit of 0.1mmol. The turnover frequency (TOF) in methanol oxidation was determined with Eq. (2).

6,Catalytic oxidation of primary alcohols on npAu in gas phase,"2.5 Catalytic oxidation of primary alcohols on npAu in gas phase Experiments were performed in a laboratory-type plug flow reactor at ambient pressure also described in Ref. [19] (Scheme 2 ). The temperature of the reactor was controlled by a liquid bath. The inlet gases were pre-heated and entered the reactor tube (8mm diameter) through a roughly 2.5mm large opening. The discs of npAu (30–31mg) were placed close to this opening so that the gas stream while not forced through the porous system was in good contact with the catalyst and any bypassing was minimized. The flow of all gases was controlled by mass flow controllers (Maettig-Bronkhorst). The total flow was set to 50sccm. The amount of alcohol was controlled by its vapor pressure. A stream of carrier gas (helium, Linde 5.0) was guided through a saturator/condensator system which allows for good control of the fraction of alcohol. The composition of the gas stream after catalytic conversion at the exit of the reactor was determined by IR gas analyzers for CO2 (URAS 10E, Hartmann und Braun) and a gas chromatograph equipped with a mass spectrometer (TRIO 1000, column INNOPEG 1000)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Structural characterization,"3.1 Structural characterization The obtained samples of npAu discs showed the typical 3 dimensional porous structure of interconnected ligaments and pores in the range of 30–40nm (Fig. 1 ). The detected residual Ag by EDX and AAS was between 0.5–1 at.% and the specific microscopic Au surface area was 16m2 g−1 (determined by electrochemical stripping of OH−, cf. the SOM) (see Fig. S2 ). For a comparison of the size distribution in npAu by TEM the method proposed by Fujita et al. has been applied [35]. Low magnification images of npAu have been taken, the power spectrum of their Fourier transform has been calculated and subsequently azimuthally averaged (Fig. S4). Due to the spinodal decomposition during the dealloying process, a characteristic peak shows up in the power spectra [36,37] corresponding to the characteristic length of npAu, which gives an estimate for the separation between the centres of neighbouring ligaments. While this method captures the entire structure, i.e., the distance between the thinner parts of the ligaments and the thicker junctions of ligaments, it is common to evaluate the ligament size also from SEM images (Figs. S5/6 and Table S1). In the latter case, the thinner section of the ligament between two ligament junctions is measured. These more figurative numbers are of course slightly smaller than the characteristic length but mostly agree, nevertheless (Table 1 ). Measurements of the characteristic length of npAu after the catalytic experiments show that the distances between centres of neighbouring ligaments can be considerably larger than before catalysis, depending on the catalytic environment. For the samples with increased temperature or increased pressure the maximum peak in the spectra is not as easy to detect as before catalysis, which is a hint, that ligaments are less uniform, i.e., the ligament junctions grow faster than the thinner sections of the ligaments. Besides the presence of Ag residing after the corrosion process, the presence of low coordinated Au surface sites and the small size of structures in the nanometer regime was one of the most critical factors explaining the high catalytic activity of Au type catalysts [25,38,39]. As already reported previously [25], the fraction of low coordinated surface atoms of this material is similar to that of only a few nanometer large particles (Fig. 2). The separation of steps in two-dimensional projections is only an approximation for the density of low coordinated surface atoms, but allows for a comparison of npAu samples under various conditions. Surprisingly the density of low coordinated surface atoms after the catalytic experiments is within the margins of error the same as before catalysis, while the ligament size is increasing. As energetics favour terraces where the coordination number of Au atoms is highest this indicates that the fraction of low coordinated sites is not only maintained but also promoted by catalytic surface reactions. The observation that the adsorption of atoms and molecules on flat Au surface results in a release of terrace atoms also supports this explanation [40]. For samples treated with 7bar oxygen, however, it has been difficult to find crystallographically identically oriented neighbouring ligaments. In pristine samples, all ligaments within one grain are single crystalline, i.e., have the same crystallographic orientation [41]. The fact that this can be partially lifted after catalytic experiments indicates movement or displacement of many atoms. This reflects how dynamic catalytic systems can be. The contamination of the samples before and after catalysis is similar (Fig. 1 and Fig. S3 after catalysis). Some surfaces are clean, some of them have a thin hydrocarbon film and some pores are nearly completely contaminated with these hydrocarbons independent on the catalytic environment."
9,Catalytic investigation,"3.2 Catalytic investigation 3.2.1 Self coupling of methanol and ethanol The aerobic oxidation of methanol resulted in the self coupling product methyl formate (MeFm) with close to 100% (fractional) selectivity. First conversion of methanol was detected after an activation period of 6–12h (Fig. 3 ), as also observed in gas phase catalytic reactions [24]. A pretreatment of samples with ozone which was reported to reduce the activation period [26] did not result in a faster activation or higher activity. A fact which might be explained by the much lower temperatures applied (e.g., 60°C as compared to over 150°C [26]) and a different surface chemistry under such conditions. To further shed light onto the characteristic of the catalytic reaction the oxygen concentration and pressure [42], respectively, were varied (Fig. 4 a). For the sake of a better comparison we calculated the concentration of oxygen (in gL−1) for both conditions, i.e. liquid phase and gas phase (cf. Tables S2 and S3). Since the activity factors can be different in both cases (oxygen dissolved vs. as a gas molecule) this is only considered a reference point. In liquid phase the conversion strongly increased from almost no conversion at 1bar (0.24gL−1 O2) to a maximum of about 0.5mol per gnpAu at 3bar (0.38gL−1 O2). Further increase of oxygen pressure, did not considerably influence the characteristics. Up until pressures of 7bar O2 (1.27gL−1 O2) the conversion of methanol remained almost constant, slightly decreasing by about 10% at 6bar O2 pressure. The slight decrease in conversion might be attributed to coarsening of the npAu structure at elevated pressures (>3bar, cf. Fig. S5 and Table S1). Experiments in the gas phase reveal a very similar behavior (Fig. 4b). Up until concentrations of oxygen of about 10vol% (0.12gL−1 O2) the rate of methyl formate production increases, but stays almost constant for higher oxygen concentrations. The observed characteristics are indicative for a zero order reaction rate for oxygen and a saturation of active sites in both phases, likely connected to Ag atoms present on the surface [23,43]. The apparently slower saturation of active sites in the liquid phase (0.27gL−1 as compared to 0.12gL−1 O2 in the gas phase) might be due to solvation of oxygen and a lower activity coefficient. The most prominent difference in both phases is the production of CO2. While in liquid phase experiments only minor concentrations of CO2 (12mmol per gnpAu at 7bar O2) could be detected, corresponding to a (fractional) selectivity for partial oxidation of 98%, it decreased to below 90% for elevated oxygen partial pressures in the gas phase (>20vol% of O2). This suggests that more reactive surface oxygen is available on the catalyst surface under latter conditions. The highest turnover frequency (TOF) of 380h−1 was observed at 80°C in liquid phase (Fig. 5a) and is comparable to numbers determined in the gas phase oxidation of methanol using nanoporous gold [20] or supported gold catalysts [18]. The apparent activation energy for the partial oxidation pathway of methanol in liquid phase was 74kJmol−1 (inset in Fig. 5a). It dropped by a factor of 2 down to 32kJmol−1 at temperatures above 60°C which can be understood based on the Thiele modulus and mass transport phenomena at higher turn-over rates [44]. The loss of selectivity in gas phase experiments at elevated oxygen concentrations and temperatures (Fig. 5b) is in line with the higher activation barrier (87.0kJmol−1) for the total oxidation as compared to the partial oxidation pathway (61.5kJmol−1) [45]. Indeed, not only methanol but also ethanol could be oxidized by molecular oxygen over nanoporous gold catalysts as well. Differences are observed in terms of selectivity; while for methanol solely the coupling product MeFm is formed, for ethanol the aldehyde, acetaldehyde (AcH), as well as the coupling product ethyl acetate (EtOAc) were detected in about the same amounts (Fig. S7). This change in selectivity was also observed in gas phase experiments and can be attributed to the lower activation barrier of the β-hydrogen elimination with longer carbon chain length (cf. Scheme 3 ) [19]. The more facile generation of surface bonded aldehyde promotes desorption instead of coupling with an adsorbed ethoxy species. 3.2.2 Cross coupling reactions As demonstrated in gas phase experiments the surface chemistry of the alcoxy species can be probed by reaction with co-reagents such as water, a second alcohol or aldehyde [19,46]. First, oxidation experiments in liquid phase were performed diluting either methanol or ethanol by water (Fig. 6 ). In case of methanol a strong decrease of methyl formate production was observed which is not in line with a mere dilution of methanol. Water and in particular formaldehyde reacts easily to the corresponding hydrate (H2C(OH)2), also called a geminal diol which would require oxidation to be removed, for example, as the acid. In this case, water competes with the coupling reaction (Scheme 3, route A). This is different for ethanol, as the corresponding hydrate of acetaldehyde readily decomposes releasing the acetaldehyde. While for pure ethanol the selectivity towards acetaldehyde was around 50 %, it increased after addition of water to nearly 80 %. The apparent reaction order for ethanol oxidation diluted by water is close to one (double logarithmic plot of the data depicted in Fig. 6), indicating that water is diluting ethanol. Next, the oxidative cross coupling of ethanol and methanol was investigated (Fig. S8a). Here, not only the already discussed products of methanol and ethanol could be observed but also the cross coupling product methyl acetate (MeOAc) by reaction of surface bonded methoxy (from methanol) and acetaldehyde (from ethanol) (Fig. S8b). This distinctively fits to the selective surface chemistry of Au for the oxidative coupling of these alcohols observed in previous gas phase studies [19,20]. The more facile abstraction of the β-hydrogen from ethoxy and the accordingly faster generation of surface bonded acetaldehyde promote the formation of methyl acetate. No ethyl formate was detected indicating much slower formation of surface bonded formaldehyde. The cross coupling between the alcoxy and the aldehyde was further probed by the addition of acetaldehyde to pure methanol. In this case, the self coupling reaction of methanol was almost completely suppressed. The cross coupling product methyl acetate stemming from the reaction of the added acetaldehyde and methoxy was formed almost exclusively (Fig. S8a)."
10,Catalytic mechanism of alcohol oxidation in liquid phase,"3.3 Catalytic mechanism of alcohol oxidation in liquid phase The observed results on the liquid phase oxidation of methanol and ethanol distinctively fit into the mechanistic framework established by model experiments and experiments in gas phase for unsupported gold surfaces [19,20]. We will discuss this surface mechanism in the context of the liquid phase (Scheme 3). First, the npAu surface is activated by adsorption of oxygen. Similar to gas phase catalysis, this step most likely involves the presence of neighbouring Ag atoms on the Au surface [23,47]. The surface oxygen reacts with the alcoholic proton in a Brønstedt acid-base reaction, yielding surface bonded alcoxy species (e.g., methoxy from methanol). In the presence of a neighbouring oxygen atom (or remaining OH group) this surface bonded alcoxy species can undergo β-hydrogen elimination, forming the aldehyde. The β-hydrogen elimination was anticipated to have the highest activation barrier and, thus, determines the selectivity [14]. It is strongly dependent on the C-chain length of the alcohol, being highest for methanol and lower for ethanol. As only very few methoxy species are transformed into a surface bonded aldehyde fast reaction between the latter and surrounding methoxy or ethoxy species result in the self and cross coupling products (pathway A). In the case of strong dilutions or a more facile abstraction of the β-hydrogen atom such as for ethanol, larger fractions of ethoxy are transformed into the aldehyde which can desorb (pathway B). If enough reactive surface oxygen is present (e.g., pure methanol and 7bar O2) the surface bonded aldehyde can undergo further H-elimination (pathway C), resulting in surface bonded carboxylate and eventually CO2 (total oxidation pathway)."
11,Conclusions,"Unsupported nanoporous gold can be employed for studying the reactivity and catalytic properties of gold surfaces under complex conditions as in liquid phase catalysis. While the bonding and activation of molecular oxygen is expected to require the presence of adjacent Ag atoms, the molecular transformation of methanol and ethanol can be anticipated based on model experiments on single crystalline Au surfaces. On the one hand, the selectivity of the reaction is determined by the formation of the aldehyde by β-hydrogen elimination of the surface bonded alcoxy species: with longer carbon chain length, i.e., when going from methanol to ethanol increasing amounts of the aldehyde are formed. While for methanol all surface bonded aldehyde is consumed by reaction with adjacent alcoxy, in case of ethanol also acetaldehyde could be detected in the reaction medium after desorption from the catalyst surface. Furthermore, cross coupling experiments (acetaldehyde addition and mixing of the both alcohols) allow to draw conclusions about the reaction on the molecular scale. The high catalytic activity of this nanoporous gold material, on the other hand, is linked to the large fraction of low coordinated surface sites. They were determined by high resolution TEM to around 25at.%, i.e., every fourth atom is located at a step or kink site, a number which is comparable to just 5nm large gold nanoparticles [25]. As these atoms are more reactive towards bonding of molecules they are likely catalytically active centers on the surface [48–50]. Interestingly, this number does not change or decrease during catalytic reaction and is sustained even while the ligaments are coarsened and the surface curvature is reduced. This is also important in the context of the similar observed catalytic activity for gas and liquid phase oxidation [18,20]."
