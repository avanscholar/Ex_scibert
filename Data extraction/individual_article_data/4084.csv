0,Introduction,"Fossil fuels have evolved as both the dominant fuel and primary industrial feedstock over the past century. The wide utilization of fossil fuel and its materials is nowadays questionable due to the extensive awareness of environmental spheres and the compulsive principle of “green and sustainable chemistry” to which the chemical industry commits itself. Angrisani et al.’s [1] studies demonstrated that solar energy and biomass indeed seem unshirkable as the promising alternative for a renewable and sustainable source other than fossil fuels and chemicals. Therefore, the action of one sun exactly answers two problems. The Sun, along with biomass, is seated in an irreplaceable position as the green energy source for the twenty-first century. Scientific efforts into inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have long-lasting benefits. It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on the mostly import-independent resource and enhance global sustainability. Solar energy is a direct source of biomass in nature. The first action in the production of biomass is photosynthesis from the sun. Photosynthesis is a process used to convert solar energy into chemical energy. This chemical energy is stored in biomass such as carbohydrate molecules, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide, water, and the sun. Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the biomass of Earth's atmosphere. Photosynthetic organisms convert around 100–115 billion tons of carbon into biomass per year (Field et al. [2]). The etymology of the term “photosynthesis” comes from the Greek photo meaning “light” and synthesis meaning “putting together,” which gives birth to biomass, reported by Long et al. [3]. Hereby, the secondary action of the sun on biomass is degradation - “breaking” biomass into smaller molecules. Hence, in this paper, we propose to use this secondary solar action of thermo-electrochemical synergy for highly efficient “breakdown” of biomass into biofuels and hydrogen. A diagram is presented for a demonstration of the actions of the sun on biomass in Fig. 1 . Biomass, including cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, is one of the most abundant polymers in nature (Kwon [4]). Chang et al. [5] proposed that the biomass comprises glucose or aromatic subunits in complex arrangement. The resulting rich carbon structure qualifies itself as a potentially sustainable feedstock for fine chemicals and biofuels. Fan et al. [6] investigated that the bio-oil can be obtained by the pyrolytic process of lignin. Moreover, the hydrogen as clean fuel can be produced through lignin by different gasification agents (Shayan et al. [7]) and catalysts (Adrados et al. [8]). Some compositions, such as lignin, are characterized by their inertness and robustness towards biomass degradation, which complicates their selective degradation into fine chemicals. Therefore, currently, the “breakdown” of biomass is quite energy intensive. In the last few decades, many researchers pursued biomass “breakdown” into its small molecular building block compounds, using methods incorporating thermolysis (Arregi et al. [9]), hydrolysis (Wang et al. [10]), homo (Wei et al. [11]) and heterogeneous (Xu et al. [12]) catalysis, etc. Most of these methods focused on thermochemical techniques, require high temperature and/or high pressure (Anca-Couce [13]), and most often take a high energetic cost (Guo et al. [14]) and produce non-selectivity (Liu et al. [15]). Because of this, such processes should be considered as less sustainable for the conversion of renewable biomass into biofuel and fine chemicals. The renewable Power-to-Gas (PtG) process may provide enlightenment to create renewable energy from the breakdown of biomass. PtG enables one to transform renewable energy to storable methane via electrolysis and subsequent methanation (Götz et al. [16]). Jentsch et al. [17] presented the perspectives of PtG in an 85% renewable energy scenario in Germany. Hashimoto et al. [18] have been working on research and development of CO2 recycling for the use of renewable energy produced via electrolytic hydrogen generation in the form of methane. The PtG process might indeed play an important role in the future energy system. Concerning the introduction of renewable energy into the biomass process, Angrisani et al. [1] developed a new concept solar-biomass cogeneration system, which uses two renewable energy sources, solar and biomass, for conversion of solar heat into electricity. Arribas et al. [19] appropriately conducted the solar thermochemical conversion of biomass. Recently, Shih et al. [20] presented a perspective of powering the future with “liquid sunshine” coming from the sun’s action on biomass. The studies of various scientific and engineering aspects performed by Hathaway et al. [21] revealed the need of developing a renewable energy source capable of continuous operation by means of solar energy only, without the supplement of conventional resources (e.g., fossil fuels). Renewable energy is the best choice for a sustainable conversion of biomass. Chintala et al. [22] proposed the process of solar thermal pyrolysis of non-edible seeds to biofuels, Gupta et al. [23] found that solar energy can be used to produce biodiesel from hempseed oil, and Milani et al. [24] analyzed different options for power generation by hybridizing Concentrated Solar Power with biomass. Electrochemistry is the synthetic organic field that enables the direct use of electricity exactly to generate valuable compounds beyond conventional chemical reducing agents or oxidizers. Thereby, the generation of reagent waste is avoided and the atom efficiency increased since only electrons are removed or added. It is a powerful and “green” tool for the breakdown and utilization of renewable biomass. Because of the inexpensive sun energy and abundant biomass, the focus of this paper is of technical interest. For these reasons, a direct link between electro-organic synthesis and “green chemistry” has been established. Schäfer et al. [25] studied the contributions of organic electrosynthesis in green chemistry. Frontana-Uribe et al. [26] reviewed the main characteristics of electrochemistry as a promising green methodology for organic synthesis. Horn et al. [27] proposed that the electrochemical methods possess many benefits over traditional reagent-based transformations, such as high functional group tolerance, mild conditions, and innate scalability and sustainability. In combination with solar energy, the electrochemical process would be sustainable and a genuine “green” option for the transformation of renewable biomass. It is noteworthy that solar energy produces abundant heat and convertible electricity to breakdown biomass. Dier et al. [28] frequently attempted to use water electrolytes for electrochemical depolymerization of biomass. Schmitt et al. [29] designed an electrolysis for the selective synthesis of vanillin from lignin by using Ni and Co-based electrodes. Some researchers (Zhu et al. [30]) achieved a polymer breakdown of more than 50% of the raw material. Dan et al. [31] made a comprehensive survey of these studies that electrochemical conversion and the product distribution strongly depend on specific electrolyzed parameters, particularly the electrolyte, the electrodes, and the temperature. However, water has been the most frequently used electrolyte in the research of electrolysis. It can work only under atmospheric pressure and temperature for the electrochemical depolymerization (Stiefel et al. [32]). Recently, a complete solution was provided by the STEP process, fully driven by solar energy as the sole energy source, for promotion of solar energy into chemical processes. The STEP theory was first proposed by Licht in 2009 [33]. Some applications for chemical processes, by using solar energy without the input of any other, have been extensively studied involving achievements of the STEP iron (Licht et al. [34]), cement (Licht et al. [35]), hydrogen (Licht et al. [36]), coal conversion (Zhu et al. [37]), ammonia (Licht et al. [38]), organic synthesis currently useful chemistries (Zhu et al. [39]), as well as 2-nitrophenol wastewater treatment (Nie et al. [40]) and nitrobenzene wastewater treatment (Gu et al. [41]). Currently, the researches have been focused on the CO2 utilization for the production of renewable energy via the STEP process (Wu et al. [42]). Yin et al. [43] attempted an investigation of the conversion of biomass to value-added carbon via a molten salt carbonization using only concentrated solar heat. A study on the STEP action to biomass, with the characteristics of renewable solar energy and a combination of thermochemical and electrochemical process, has not been disclosed until now. The STEP process utilizes multifield solar energy for sub-chemistries by budgeting on the matched and coupled distributions of three conversion efficiencies of the photo, thermal, and electrical characteristics of three chemistries of photo-, electro- and thermo-chemistry. This solar system can be synergistically controlled for the enhanced chemical conversion and selectivity by the three conversions and the responding three chemistries. Based on the theory of the STEP process, more solar heat and less electricity greatly favor a high solar utilization and conversion efficiency for endothermic reactions. The chemical pathways would be changed/modified by the solar thermo-coupled electricity. Solar heat energy enables a decrease of the energy and potential required by endothermic electrochemical reaction for overcoming the activation energy. Herein, we designed and investigated an intrinsic method for solar-driven heat and electricity to create a breakdown of biomass, in combination with solar thermo- electrochemical and a sustainable and genuine “green” process beyond the energy-cost and nonselective passivation. As the solar STEP process, the effective joint of solar thermochemistry can make the electrochemical potential significantly reduced for some reactions, especially the endothermic oxidation reaction, thus actually reducing the electrochemical energy in the basis of the characteristics of the targeted pollutant and STEP chemistry. In this paper, one solution substantially lifted the breakdown rate of biomass with high selectivity under the combined actions of thermochemistry and electrochemistry. A novel and an energy-free way for wastewater treatment were accomplished by the synergistic use of solar energy without any other input of energy. Fig. 2 displays a schematic of the STEP depolymerization of biomass in the paper. The STEP biomass process demonstrates some novel features: (1) A new depolymerization of biomass was proposed and realized. (2) It is fully driven by renewable solar energy, with no input from other energies. (3) It combines solar thermo- and electrochemistry. (4) It enhanced the solar utilization and chemical reaction by matching and coupling solar energy with specific chemistries. Therefore, the investigation achieved a renewable and sustainable system of biomass to fuels with a high liquification, gasification, and rich hydrogen production."
1,Experimental section,"In this experiment, a new concept of producing biofuel and hydrogen from biomass via a concentrating solar heat generator and PV module as a sole energy source is proposed. The aim of the concept is to obtain an easy to handle biofuel and hydrogen with near-zero CO2 emission compared to conventional generation biofuels. The concept’s key feature is the use of solar high-temperature heat and electricity from the sun to drive the chemical process of converting biomass to a biofuel and hydrogen, obtaining a near-complete utilization of carbon atoms in the biomass and H2 from water electrolysis with solar power. For reference to the literature and availability, the methyl cellulose and lignin were chosen as two model compounds of the biomass (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin)."
2,The preparation of samples and reagents,"2.1 The preparation of samples and reagents The methyl cellulose and lignin as the experimental samples were received from Industrial Manufacturers. The detailed data are described in the ESI. The lignin was extracted by an acid precipitation method. The molecular weight is about 4000 Daltons. Before use, the samples were dried at 100 °C for 24 h. The composition of the samples was determined by a test method for the ASTM standard (ASTM E1131-08(2014)). Except as stated, all the reagents in this study were commercially purchased in analytical products without further purification."
3,The measurements of the thermogravimetric analysis,"2.2 The measurements of the thermogravimetric analysis The thermogravimetric experiments were carried out on a thermogravimetric analyzer (TG, TA Instruments- SDT Q600, 0.001 °C and 0.1 µg). The heating rate was 15 °C/min with air as a carrier gas. To screen the weight loss and stable temperature, methyl cellulose with/without NaOH and KOH were used for an investigation of the pyrolysis in the range of the RT to 650 °C. The weight loss was observed during the elevated temperature."
4,The measurements of thermo-induced cyclic voltammetry,"2.3 The measurements of thermo-induced cyclic voltammetry For verifying and detecting the redox chemistry of biomass and the coupling effect of thermo-induced electrolysis in the STEP action to biomass, the thermo-induced cyclic voltammetry analysis of cellulose and lignin was performed by an electrochemical workstation (CHI650d, Shanghai). The three electrodes were used in a pattern of a working electrode and a counter electrode integrated to a reference electrode. All the electrodes were made of pure nickel sheets (the effective area 1.0 × 2.0 cm2) placed into the electrolyte of the eutectic KOH-NaOH molten salts with a reactor described in the following section. The scanning rate was 10 mV·s−1, and the potential was scanned in the range of −1.5 V ∼ 1.5 V."
5,Configuration of the solar reactor of thermolysis-coupled and electrochemical polymerization,"2.4 Configuration of the solar reactor of thermolysis-coupled and electrochemical polymerization The configuration of the solar reactor is presented in Fig. 3 . A high-purity corundum crucible (ɸ 40 × 80 mm) was employed for the reactive cell with the top sealing. The gas collector was equipped with a condenser. Both the anode and cathode were made of pure nickel and parallelly situated in the low part of the electrolyte. The gap between the anode and cathode was 1 cm. The mixture of the powdered sample and electrolyte (the eutectic KOH-NaOH, molar rate = 0.48:0.52) was added into the reactor. The total solid concentration was set in the range of 1:15–1:7.5 w/w for methyl cellulose and 1:60–1:15 w/w for lignin. The solar heat and electricity were applied by a solar heat concentrator and PV module."
6,Experiments of the Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) depolymerization of biomass,"2.5 Experiments of the Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) depolymerization of biomass The mixed alkali KOH/NaOH system plays a key role of a supporting electrolyte for the low-temperature molten salts. So, the eutectic KOH/NaOH molten salts were used as the electrolyte for the supply of H2O and oxygen with a high conductivity. The two electrodes were inserted into the corundum crucible by keeping a 1 cm gap. The reactor was sealed with graphite packing and was fastened with bolts and nuts. The condensing, drying, and collecting devices were connected to the reactor. The reactor was placed in a heater with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The reactor was set and heated to the presetting temperature (350 °C, 360 °C, 370 °C, 380 °C, 390 °C, 400 °C). During the reaction, the as-gas products were passed through the condenser (U-tube cooled by the water bath). The liquid phase product is condensed on the inner wall of the U-shaped tube. The ambient gas was pumped into the gas bags for the GC analysis. The products of the liquid and solid in the electrolyte was separated by methods described in the analysis section. The experimental apparatus for the investigation of the thermolysis-coupled electrochemical depolymerization of biomass was assembled by three parts: a solar to the electric unit, solar to the thermal unit, and solar reactor. The schematic and practical diagram are shown in Fig. 4 , and the details were described in our previous paper (Nie et al. [40]). Solar to thermal unit: A paraboloidal solar concentrator (ɸ 1.5 m, radiated area 1.8 m2, focused point, maximum temperature 1000 °C/ɸ 6–7 cm, ±10 °C), equipped with 2-dimensional tracking reflector system at high magnification, was used for the solar to thermal units to control the temperature of the reactor by adjusting the receiver to intersect this line. Solar to the electric unit: The solar photovoltaic module (output Vmax 5 V, Imax 1 A, and radiated surface area 60 cm2), with a rechargeable Li-ion battery and current/potential regulator (±0.1 V), was employed for the solar photoelectric units for the reactor. Solar reactor: The solar reactor and the program for the operation were the same as described in the above section. The reactor is made of Type 304 stainless steel (Fig. 3). The cover plate is circular, the sleeve is cylindrical. The cover plate and the sleeve are fixed with bolts, which can be sealed to facilitate the collection of gas. There are five holes on the cover plate: one for gas-in, one for gas-out, two for electrodes and one for the thermocouple. The cylindrical corundum crucible is placed in the sleeve. The diameter and height of the crucible are 4.5 cm and 10 cm. The volume of the crucible is 159 cm3. One thermocouple was directly inserted into the half level of the molten salt in the experiments."
7,Analysis of the products,"2.6 Analysis of the products The products are divided into three phases: gas phase, liquid phase, and solid phase. Gas phase at high temperature contains the ambient gases and small organic molecules. After the condensation, we separated the ambient gases and liquid organic molecules. After the reaction, the solidified electrolyte was dissolved by water. The insoluble solid phase was filtered for a separation of the solid phase. The remaining liquid phase was extracted by an organic solvent. The solid phase contains insoluble compounds and organic solvent, which consists of the carbon and high carbon polymer. Gas analysis: The volume of the ambient gas after the condensation was calculated. Then, the components and contents of the gases were analyzed by a multidimensional refinery gas chromatography analyzer. The instruments can simultaneously quantify the hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and C1-C5 hydrocarbons. Liquid and solid analysis: The solidified electrolyte was dissolved in water, and then filtered to separate the solid phase and water phase. The solid phase was washed, dried and weighed. The water phase was acidified for a precipitate of the unreacted lignin. The filtrate was extracted with ether for the separation of the water and organic layers, and the organic layer was evaporated at room temperature to get the oil-soluble organic fraction. The water layer was dewatered to obtain the water-soluble organic fraction. The collection of the water and organic fraction was combined into the liquid phase. The after-extraction water phase was analyzed by a TOC analyzer (TEKMAR Torch, America) for quantitation of carbon contents in the acidified water-soluble organic fraction. According to the literature (Xu et al. [12]), the liquefaction rate was calculated by the following equation: R liquid = C TOC / C EA × 100 % Therein, CTOC is the carbon content (mg(C)/g of the lignin feedstock) determined by the TOC in the acidified water-soluble organic fraction, and CEA is the carbon content of the initial lignin sample (442.1 mg(C)/g of the lignin feedstock) determined by the elemental analyzer (Vario Micro Cube, Elementar Analysen systeme, Germany). Combined amounts of the three fractions (the condensed organic fraction in the gas phase, water-soluble organic fraction, and oil-soluble organic fraction) were weighed for the fraction of the liquid phase."

9,Model and analysis of the Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) depolymerization of biomass to biofuels and hydrogen,"3.1 Model and analysis of the Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) depolymerization of biomass to biofuels and hydrogen With the fatal shortage of fossil fuel, many types of research on alternative fuels have gained interest in recent years. Biomass, as the most abundant material on earth, is a promising renewable and ideal feedstock for the production of fuels and chemicals. For the appropriate valorization, it presents a challenge to choose a current technology for effectively depolymerizing biomass. Biomass is a very stable polymer, mainly structured by CC, CH, and CO bonds with the intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonding network. Breaking of these bonds is tough, even for pyrolysis depolymerization of biomass by conventional energy. So, seeking alternative energy sources and methods is intensively investigated worldwide. The STEP biomass depolymerization is a novel method that utilizes the solar thermal and electrical energy to induce/conduct the corresponding electrochemical and thermochemical depolymerization of biomass to generate a useful fuel plus an abundant amount of hydrogen. The STEP process has taken jointly the solar electric field into the solar heat field instead of only the thermal field as in conventional pyrolysis. With two actions or combined effects for “green chemistry,” the solar utilization and chemical efficiency will be improved by lowing temperature and oxidation potential. It is noteworthy that solar energy produces more heat and electricity to act as a thermolysis-coupled electrochemical breaking of biomass bonds. A comparison of the energy levels in the pyrolysis, electrolysis and thermolysis-coupled electrochemical breaking of biomass are displayed in Fig. 5 . It is noted that conventional pyrolysis consumes a lot of energy and that electrolysis would be powered by high amounts of electricity, while the STEP process is fully driven by inexhaustible solar energy and option of the two sub-chemistries for the reaction. For the pyrolysis with one chemistry, the main reaction occurs in the thermochemistry: (1) Biomass → Degraded-Biomass + CH4 + o-Compounds + …… + H2 (pyrolysis for oxidation + hydrogen) For the STEP process with two chemistries, the main reaction is focused on the thermo-coupled electrochemistry. Besides the thermochemistry: (2) Biomass → Degraded-Biomass + CH4 + o-Compounds + …… + H2 (pyrolysis for oxidation + hydrogen) And the thermo-induced electrochemistry: (3) Anode: Biomass – ne− → Degraded-Biomass + CH4 + o-Compounds + …… + H2 (oxidation + hydrogen for bond breaking) (4) Cathode: nH+ + ne− → n/2H2 (reduction for hydrogen evolution) In addition to the thermochemical production of hydrogen, an abundant amount of hydrogen is simultaneously evolved at the cathode by electrolysis. For the electrolysis, the applied voltage presented a difference of the potentials of the cathode and anode in the below equation: E applied = ψ anode - ψ cathode Here, the ψanode and ψcathode are the potentials of the cathode and anode, respectively, which depends on the oxidation reaction (discharged electrons) on the anode and reduction (charged electrons) on the cathode. In a pure water, the electrolyzed reaction occurs as follows: Anode: H2O − 2e− = 2H+ + 1/2 O2 ψH2O-O2 Cathode: 2H+ + 2e− = H2 ψH2O-H2 Total reaction: H2O = H2 = 1/2O2 E H 2 O = ψ H 2 O - O 2 - - ψ H 2 O - H 2 It is a mechanism of the electrochemical splitting of the pure water. If adding the apt oxidation/reduction composition, for a sample (cellulose in water) the reactions would happen as follows: Anode: H2O − 2e− → 2H+ + 1/2O2 ψH2O-O2 Cellulose – ne− → oxidized-CelluloseψCellulose Cathode: 2H+ + 2e− = H2 ψH2O-H2 The oxidation potential of the cellulose is less than that of water (ψCellulose < ψH2O-O2). Therefore, the cellulose is oxidized prior to water. Total reaction: Cellulose + nH+ → oxidized-Cellulose + mH2 E Cellulose = ψ Cellulose - ψ H 2 O - H 2 Due to the ψCellulose < ψH2O-O2, the ECellulose is less than the direct EH2O. Therefore, the addition of the cellulose switches the easy pathway of hydrogen production from the splitting of water to the oxidation (eliminating) of cellulose with a small applied voltage and high efficiency. In addition, the STEP process can conduct a high heat operation. According to the calculation of the chemical thermodynamics, the electrolyzed potential would be dropped for an endothermic oxidation in the high temperature. A produced system of hydrogen can be effectively driven with a low consumption of the electrolysis energy by the increased potential. The building block of cellulose is unstable and easy to be oxidized at high temperature. Lignin is a complex and water-insoluble (pH < 9) polymer exhibiting aromatic subunits, which is relatively stable. Lignin qualifies as a potential renewable feedstock for the production of bio-based fuels. Due to the natural complexity and thermal degradation, cellulose was employed for the production of hydrogen at high temperature and lignin was used for both the biofuel and hydrogen in this study. The cellulose and lignin can be dissolved to form a homogeneous solution in alkaline molten salts. So, the eutectic KOH/NaOH molten salts were used as the electrolyte for the supply of H2O and oxygen elements with a high conductivity and mass transportation. In the review of energy and chemistry of the STEP depolymerization of biomass, the process was fully driven by the renewable solar energy through a combination of solar thermo- and electrochemistry. The system achieved a high liquefaction, gasification, and rich hydrogen rate under a low operating temperature and potential compared with biomass pyrolysis. Due to the electrolysis, abundant hydrogen was produced at the electrode. All the data are demonstrated in the following section."
10,Production of hydrogen via the Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) depolymerization of cellulose,"3.2 Production of hydrogen via the Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) depolymerization of cellulose 3.2.1 The thermogravimetric analysis of the pyrolysis of cellulose For screening the electrolyte and stable temperature zone, the TG curves of methyl cellulose mixed with/without KOH and NaOH presented for an investigation of the pyrolysis (Fig. 6 ). The four curves showed obvious difference. After adding 25% NaOH in methyl cellulose, the TG curve of pyrolysis changed dramatically. At the same time, with a small amount of KOH and NaOH added, the initial temperature of pyrolysis of methyl cellulose decreased significantly. The effect is more obvious with the increase of the amount of KOH. This indicates that the presence of NaOH and KOH makes the weight loss of methyl cellulose quick. The sharp drop was observed in the range of 260–350 °C owing to the effect of the bases (KOH and NaOH) on the methyl cellulose. The weight loss implies that the methyl cellulose was stable during the elevated temperature. The stable platform was found in a range of 200–260 °C in the presence of the mixed alkaline. The working temperature was set in the heated zone in this study. 3.2.2 Cyclic voltammetry measurements for the redox chemistry of the Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) depolymerization of cellulose As known, temperature has a great effect on electrolysis systems. In the CV measurements, the temperature was 200 °C, 230 °C, and 250 °C, respectively, with a scanning rate of 30 mV/s. The thermo-induced cyclic voltammetry curves of methyl cellulose at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 7 . It can be seen from the diagram that the four oxidation peaks (AI, AII, AIII, and AIV) were observed in the positive range towards a positive scanning, which is attributed to the four oxidation peaks in methyl cellulose. It implied that the four groups or bonds were oxidatively broken on the methyl cellulose, possibly in the form of the loss of hydrogen, side chain, end chain, and C-O group or the random cleavage reaction. The potentials were lower than the one of oxygen evolution from water. That means that the oxidation potential of methyl cellulose was lower than that of water. It is proved that methyl cellulose is effectively oxidized by thermo-aided electrochemistry in the reaction system. Due to having less than the oxygen evolution potential of water, the methyl cellulose oxidation is apt to occur instead of the oxygen evolution by the oxidation of water (AV). The data demonstrate the that ECellulose is less than the direct EH2O owing to ψCellulose < ψH2O-O2. It is noted that the potential of the oxidation peak decreases and the peak current increases with the increase of temperature. At 200 °C, the peak potential of the oxidation is 0.72 V and peak current is 240 mA. When the temperature reaches 250 °C, the peak potential of the oxidation decreases to 0.64 V, and the oxidation current rises to 260 mA. As the temperature increases, the activation energy of the reaction decreases gradually and the reaction proceeds in a more favorable direction. At the same time, the temperature increases, the reaction rate increases, the increase of temperature provides an increase of heat energy, reduces the demand for electric energy in the reaction process, and makes the reaction more energy-efficient. Methyl cellulose undergoes Thermo-Electrochemical coupling, resulting in the unstable structure of cellulose macromolecule chain breaking, resulting in the formation of active intermediates more easily oxidized. It can be concluded that high temperature is beneficial to the formation of active intermediates of methyl cellulose and the release of hydrogen by the thermo-induced electrochemical oxidation-reduction reaction. 3.2.3 Dependence of the temperature on yield of hydrogen In the above section, we displayed that temperature has a significant effect on the pyrolysis of methyl cellulose, which is an important factor affecting the hydrogen production of methyl cellulose via the solar STEP depolymerization under the condition of the eutectic molten alkali electrolyte. The experiments were performed with both anode and cathode made of Ni sheets (2 × 2 cm2), eutectic molten alkali KOH-NaOH (molar ratio = 0.48:0.52, 30 g), and methyl cellulose (feedstock 3 g) under a constant current of 0 mA, 100 mA, and 300 mA, respectively. The one-hour-duration hydrogen volume was collected and then analyzed. The dependence of the temperature on yields of hydrogen is shown in Fig. 8 . It is obviously noted that the hydrogen production of the pyrolysis (current = 0 mA) is enormously lower than the STEP depolymerization. The STEP hydrogen is 7.2 times higher under a current of 100 mA compared to the pyrolysis at 200 °C. It is also shown that only the effect of heat cannot degrade methyl cellulose to obtain a high yield of hydrogen, and that adding electricity has a significant effect on the reaction. As the temperature was raised, the production of H2 increased. The hydrogen yield at the high temperature was much higher than the one at the low temperature. When the temperature is low, the activated methyl cellulose does not produce a pyrolysis reaction, but the electrolysis comes to play a key role in the electrooxidization of methyl cellulose for hydrogen production. As the temperature continues to rise, the coupling of both pyrolysis and electrolysis takes action at the same time. The reaction of methyl cellulose in molten alkali thermo-electrolysis produces different sources of H2, one of which is a fraction of hydrogen produced by the oxidative breaking of the chemical bonds (H-C and H-O) in the structure of methyl cellulose via the pyrolysis and electrolysis, and the other is due to the reduction of water at the cathode. Under heat, the cellulose molecule is dehydrogenated at the anode, and water is reduced to release hydrogen at the cathode. To measure the voltage change under the constant current of 100 mA at 200 °C, it was observed that voltage was ∼1.4 V at 200 °C (molten salt system) while ∼2.5 V at 50 °C (aqueous alkaline solution system). The applied voltage at the high temperature is lower than the voltage at the low temperature under the same current. The small potential suppresses the byproduct reaction of the electrooxidation of water. 3.2.4 Dependence of the current on the yield of hydrogen Based on the above comprehensive analysis, the suitable reaction temperature was determined for this experiment to be 200 °C under the constant current of 0 mA, 100 mA, 200 mA, 300 mA and 400 mA, respectively, besides the factors as described in the above sections. The dependence of the current on yields of hydrogen is shown in Fig. 9 . It can be seen from the curve that when the current is zero (pyrolysis), a small amount of hydrogen was produced only via the pyrolysis, but the hydrogen production was greatly elevated by adding the electrolysis. With the increase of current intensity, the hydrogen contents were lifted by the STEP process of the electrothermal coupling effect. However, the hydrogen increment got small with the increase of current intensity. It lifted the applied voltage with a large energy consumption of the electrolysis. 3.2.5 Dependence of the methyl cellulose feedstock on the yield of hydrogen Besides the conditions as described in the above sections, the experiments were conducted under the constant current of 100 mA, 200 mA, 300 mA, and 400 mA with the feedstock of methyl cellulose 2.0 g, 3.0 g, 4.0 g respectively. The change of hydrogen yield is shown in Fig. 10 . According to the diagram, hydrogen production increased with the increase of methyl cellulose dosage when the current was constant. However, the amount per unit mass was decreased. This is because of the limitation of the dominated electrode area and the electrochemical reaction rate. Therefore, this experimental data is more appropriate to determine the methyl cellulose dosage. 3.2.6 Dependence of the composition of molten salts on the yield of hydrogen In the process of the STEP hydrogen production by methyl cellulose, the eutectic molten alkali KOH-NaOH acts as a reactive electrolyte, dispersant, and heat carrier, and participates in the reaction evolution of hydrogen. The great effect of the molten base occurs in the STEP process of methyl cellulose. The experimental data were presented in Fig. 11 for the KOH mass fraction of 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, and 70% (w/w), respectively, (the total mass 30 g, and the melting point 170–218 °C). Fig. 11 shows that with the increase of the mass fraction of KOH in the molten alkaline system, the variation of H2 yield is basically the same, and the H2 yield in the product increases continuously. Essentially, molten salt is actually a molten liquid of alkaline. The effect of molten KOH and NaOH on the electrolysis process is actually the function of K+ and Na+. The conversion of methyl cellulose to hydrogen by the STEP process is an electrothermal coupling process, which is the process of mutual promotion between thermal energy and electric energy. At high temperature, an increased amount of K+ ion elevated the production of hydrogen via the STEP process. The KOH content has great influence on promoting the thermo- and electrochemical process. The increase of the KOH content is beneficial to the increase of H2 yield. However, the elevated fraction of KOH will increase the molten point of the mixed KOH and NaOH detrimental to the mass transfer. 3.2.7 The dependence of the reaction time on the yield of hydrogen Fig. 12 shows the dependence of the reaction time on the yield of hydrogen. It is indicated that both volume yields were elevated by increasing the reaction time. However, both rates of hydrogen production were slowly dropped with extending the reaction time. By investigating the effect of these conditions, it is concluded that some parameters, such as the temperature, current, dosage, and molten alkali electrolyte, are positively favorable to the STEP hydrogen production from the conversion of methyl cellulose. The STEP Hydrogen is 7.2 times greater under a current of 100 mA and 8.8 times greater at 400 mA compared to the pyrolysis at 200 °C. The liquefaction rate of methyl cellulose was preliminarily studied. The liquefaction rate was varied with the temperature. At 200 °C, the liquefaction rate is 27.61%. Because the use of methyl cellulose was focused on hydrogen production in this paper, no further work was done on the liquid products. In the GC analysis, some products, such as hydrogen and methane (ambient gas), alcohols, acids, aldehydes, and other organic compounds (condensed substances) were detected in the STEP, which can be used as fuel and chemical products."
11,Production of biofuel and hydrogen via the Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) depolymerization of lignin,"3.3 Production of biofuel and hydrogen via the Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) depolymerization of lignin 3.3.1 Cyclic voltammetry measurements for the redox chemistry of the Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) depolymerization of lignin Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is an important tool for detecting redox reactions. It can judge whether the redox reactions occur under certain potentials. Fig. 13 shows the cyclic voltammograms of lignin at different temperatures. For the CV of lignin, the three oxidation peaks (AI, AII, and AIII) emerged in the positive range towards a positive scanning, which is attributed to the three oxidation peaks in lignin. It implied that more than three electrons were lost on the biomass, possibly in the form of the loss of hydrogen, side chain, end chain, CO group, or the random cleavage reaction. The potentials were lower than the potential of oxygen evolution of water. That means that the oxidation potential of lignin was lower than that of water. It is proved that lignin is effectively oxidized by thermo-aided electrochemistry in the reaction system. Due to having less than the oxygen evolution potential of water, the lignin oxidation is apt to occur instead of the oxygen evolution by the oxidation of water (AIV). Opposed the three oxidation peaks, three reduction peaks (CI, CII, and CIII) were matched in the range of −0.1 to −1.0 V potential towards a negative scanning. This means that the same oxidized position was reduced in the negative potential. As the temperature increased, the Vonset and Vpeak were decreased as shown in Fig. 13, which indicates that an increase in the temperature is beneficial to reduce the electrolysis potential and raise the occurring possibility of the electrochemical oxidation reaction of lignin. At the same time, the great lift in Ipeak with increasing temperature also demonstrates that the increase in temperature enhanced the degree of the electrochemical reaction in Fig. 13. The curves clearly shows the heat effect on the electrochemical depolymerization of biomass. The effect is attributed to a contribution of the inclusion of the solar thermoenergy to increase the electrooxidation with a decrease in the oxidation potential and energy consumption. 3.3.2 Dependence of yields on temperature and current via the Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) depolymerization of lignin The yield of the Gas Phase: The experiments of the dependence of yield of gas phase on temperature and current were performed in the varied conditions via the STEP depolymerization of lignin. The curves are shown in Figs. 14 and 15 . It is notably seen that the volume of gases was increased by the elevated temperature and current. The composition of gaseous products in the STEP process was mainly composed of hydrogen, methane, and other hydrocarbons. The hydrogen dominates the volume of the gas phase. The main gaseous product in the pyrolysis was methane, and the amount of methane increases with the increase of reaction time. For a comparison of the STEP process (340 °C, 400 mA, and 3 h duration) and pyrolysis (340 °C, 0 mA, and 3 h duration), the curves were collected in Fig. 16 . The hydrogen conversion of reaction via the STEP process was higher than the one via the pyrolysis while the volume of methane decreased with time in the STEP process. The above analysis proves that the gas yield of the STEP process is much higher than one of the pyrolysis. Hydrogen production can be facilitated by temperature and current increases. The selectivity of produced gases can be achieved by adjusting the mode and conditions (temperature and current). The yield of the Liquid Phase: The yield of the liquid phase is plotted for a demonstration of effects on temperature and current (Figs. 17 and 18 ). The liquid rate was increased by elevating the temperature and current. The STEP conversion of liquid product was 57.72%, while the pyrolysis was 25.81%. More liquid biofuel was obtained in the STEP process. The data displays that the STEP process can efficiently promote the conversion of lignin into the liquid biofuel. The yield of the solid Phase: The experiments on the dependence of yield of the solid phase on temperature and current were performed in the varied conditions via the STEP depolymerization of lignin. The yields of the solid phase are shown in Figs. 19 and 20 . It is observed that with an increase of temperature, the coking rate increases from 3.94% (260 °C) to 7.72% (340 °C). But the effect of current is small on the yield of the solid phase. The electrolysis can control the coking rate. 3.3.3 The comparison of the Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) depolymerizations and the conventional pyrolysis of lignin The STEP lignin depolymerization was carried out for 3 h at 340 °C under a constant current of 400 mA while also running the conventional pyrolysis conversion under the same conditions with zero current. The conversions of the gas, liquid, and solid phase are listed in Table 1 . Compared to the pyrolysis conversion reactions of 52.39%, the total conversion of the STEP process was 87.22%. The lignin residual via the STEP process was significantly lower than that of pyrolysis. The liquid phase greatly increased by STEP lignin conversion. The gas conversion was slightly changed with a majority of hydrogen in the STEP process while the pyrolysis took a major part of methane. The abundance of liquid phase means an easy production of biofuel. The statistical analysis was plotted in the Figs. 17 and 18. The error and repeatability of the experimental data were demonstrated for the range of 5–8% (the yield of the liquid phase)."
12,Simplified mechanism and pathways of the Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) depolymerization of biomass,"3.4 Simplified mechanism and pathways of the Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) depolymerization of biomass The mechanism of conventional pyrolysis of biomass has been extensively investigated for many years. The general chemical mechanisms of biomass pyrolysis have been widely reported and are well accepted (Anca-Couce [13]). For the pyrolysis of biomass, the most common reaction mechanism is the thermochemical reaction involving the breaking of the bonds in the main chain and branched chain via a (i) random chain scission, (ii) end chain scission, and (iii) side chain scission. Due to the addition of electrochemistry, the mechanism of pathways becomes complicated for the thermo-coupled electrochemical depolymerization. For an easy understanding, a simplified mechanism and pathways are proposed for the thermo-coupled electrochemical depolymerization of biomass. Fig. 21 plots a scheme of the pathways. Generally, the mechanism can be described by a series of thermo/electro-induced free radical reactions. The thermo-electric coupling mechanism belongs to the free radical mechanism initiated by anodic electron transfer. The reaction process consists of a series of free radical reactions and electrochemical redox reactions, including (1) thermo-aided anode electron transfer initiating the generation of free radicals, (2) anodic/heat β-cleavage, (3) anodic/heat generation of methyl radicals, (4) intermolecular hydrogen transfer, (5) intramolecular hydrogen transfer, (6) electro-reaction of free radicals with oxygen to the O-containing compounds, and (7) cathode H+ reduction to hydrogen. Besides the breaking of the main chain of the polymer, the building block will be electrooxidized under an induction of solar heat: The mechanism is highly complicated owing to the thermochemistry, electrochemistry, and coupling in the high-temperature molten salt. More work is needed for an in-depth insight into the detailed mechanism. A brief analysis of the economic cost was conducted for the STEP process. The process is fully driven by solar energy, thus the energy investment will be saved. Only the equipment costs, such as the solar concentrator, solar cell packs, and reactors, should be covered in the cost. From the financial point of view, the energy cost holds most of the weight. It is estimated that the STEP economic cost is far lower than the traditional pyrolysis process. Pyrolysis requires a high conventional fuel consumption. By using solar energy, the STEP process is a renewable and sustainable system with higher efficiencies. Just as illustrated in Fig. 2, the STEP process will realize a sustainable system with the feedstock of renewable biomass and input of solar energy. The all-day discontinuity of solar energy will block the study and application. Some technologies will overcome the limitation by utilizing thermal storage and electric generation of the solar molten salts. A perspective of the smart system can work around the clock. It is directly driven by solar energy in the daytime, and operated by the solar molten salts at night. The STEP process can be a continuous process, which is fully driven by solar energy without the input of any other energy."
13,Conclusions,"In this paper, the secondary solar action on biomass was proposed to conduct a “breakdown” of biomass into biofuels plus hydrogen by the adaptation of the Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP). This STEP system was designed and employed to synergize solar energy and the corresponding biomass chemistry. The results demonstrated the following findings: (1) The system was fully driven by renewable solar energy, with no input from other energies. (2) The STEP temperature was greatly lowered by an intervention of the electrolysis, compared with conventional pyrolysis. (3) By introducing electrochemical synergy, the STEP process efficiently and selectively achieved high liquification, gasification, and rich hydrogen production. (4) Due to matching and coupling solar energy with an integration of solar thermo- and electrochemistry, the system achieved a high utilization of solar energy and a high chemical conversion of biomass. The experimental results display that the STEP hydrogen production of cellulose was 7.2 times higher under a current of 100 mA and 8.8 times higher at 400 mA in comparison with the pyrolysis at 200 °C. With a simultaneous production of biofuel and hydrogen, the STEP lignin conversions were significantly improved by reaching 87.22%, 21.78%, 57.72%, and 7.22% (340 °C, 400 mA) while the pyrolysis achieved only 52.39%, 19.48%, 25.81%, and 7.10% (340 °C, 0 mA), respectively, for the total rate, solid, liquid and gas fractions. The light hydrocarbons in the gas phase, such as methane, ethane, and n-pentane, are more abundant via the STEP process. The STEP chemistry for converting biomass to biofuels and hydrogen was elucidated in the context. The simplified mechanism can be described by a series of thermo/electro-induced free radical reactions and electrochemical redox reactions. The system, built on the solar energy and specific chemical reactions, features an ideal, green, sustainable, and recyclable operation of solar action on biomass for the efficient production of biofuels and hydrogen."
