0,Introduction,"The current rate of global energy consumption demands the best alternative energy sources, especially from the sustainable and renewable energy processes, which should be environmentally benign processes to produce zero carbon emission compared to fossil fuels (Qiu et al., 2016; Grigioni et al., 2016; Rao et al., 2019; Li et al., 2018; Kudo and Miseki, 2009; Abdalla et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2013; Han et al., 2019). Furthermore, hydrogen (H2) is used as a transportable chemical fuel in many domestic applications, automobile sectors, industrial and rocket fuel ( Fig. 1) (Hisatomi et al., 2014; Colmenares and Luque, 2014; Kuang et al., 2020; Vanneste et al., 2017; Safari and Dincer, 2020). Over the past few decades, the generation of H2 via water splitting using photocatalysts has gained much attention, which can be the best alternative fuel to replace carbon-based oils like diesel, kerosene, and petrol (Sukumaran et al., 2011; Len and Luque, 2014; Xiao and Varma, 2016; Liu et al., 2018; Colón, 2016; Yuan et al., 2016). Over the years, research efforts have been expanded towards designing novel photocatalysts by varying different parameters in order to boost the photocatalytic H2 efficiency using homo and heterogeneous, ternary and binary nanocomposites (Babu et al., 2015; Hafeez et al., 2018; Lakshmana Reddy et al., 2017, 2018a; Liu et al., 2019; Praveen Kumar et al., 2015, 2016; Rao et al., 2020a; Reddy et al., 2017a; Reddy et al., 2018a,b,c, 2021; Kumari et al., 2018, 2017; Police et al., 2014; Urupalli et al., 2020; Raghavan et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2019; Yusuf et al., 2019; Raghava et al., 2020; Manchala et al., 2019). Among these, the core-shell structured photocatalysts play the key roles to achieve the improved photocatalytic properties having large scale applications (Hafeez et al., 2018; Bagheri et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016b, 2013b, 2019, 2015, 2017; Kavil et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2016; Subha et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2017a; Vamvasakis et al., 2016; David et al., 2018; Preethi and Kanmani, 2013; Zhang et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2013c, 2017; Tian et al., 2018; Zubair et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2019). In addition to metal oxides, other noble metals, metal oxy-nitrides, and carbonaceous materials have also been used as non-core/shell or nanocomposites for photocatalytic applications (Chaudhuri and Paria, 2012; Parlett et al., 2013; Maeda et al., 2007, 2010; Sun et al., 2017b, 2017a; Yang et al., 2013a, 2014, 2013d; She et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2014b, 2019; Xiong et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2011, 2016; Ravi et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2012; Shen et al., 2019). However, researchers are yet facing many challenges such as exciton charge carrier recombination (surface and bulk), photocorrosion, limited/poor visible/sunlight activity, and inadequate band edge potentials. These drawbacks can be overcome via the development of core-shell structured photocatalysts, as these can exhibit controlled photocorrosion properties. Especially, metal chalcogenides can control the excitons recombination and enhance the reusability and recyclable stability for long hours usages during the photocatalytic processes (Li et al., 2013c; Sang et al., 2011; Rakkesh and Balakumar, 2013)."
1,Literature review of metal chalcogenides-based photocatalysts and their applications in H2 production,"1.1 Literature review of metal chalcogenides-based photocatalysts and their applications in H2 production Researchers have developed metal chalcogenides for energy production and storage applications ( Fig. 2). Metal sulfides have unique properties such as vacant d orbital and more sensitivity (Chen et al., 2013; Tang et al., 2017). Zhang et al. (2013) examined CdS/g-C3N4 hierarchal nanostructures that have shown significant photocatalytic performances under visible light irradiation. Yang et al., developed CdS/ZnO core/shell nanofibers, which showed an excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution for longer hours (Yang et al., 2013b). Recently, our research group studied the various types of metal chalcogenides (CdS, Cu2S and CdSe) as the core and TiO2 or NiO as the shell materials for intensified photocatalytic H2 generation under sunlight, UV–visible, and visible light irradiation (Rao et al., 2018, 2020b; Reddy et al., 2018b; Lakshmana Reddy et al., 2018a; Navakoteswara Rao et al., 2019). The list of chalcogenides-based photocatalyst for H2 production is given in Table 1. It can be observed from the literature that there have been considerable works dedicated to the synthesis of photocatalytic materials with core/shell structure by keeping the photoactive material as core and photo-sensitive material as a shell. Later, it was evolved to have the core/shell structures based on their band edge positions to effectively facilitate the charge transfer at the interfaces. The selection of core and shell materials could be based on the requirements, where a range of materials including metals, metal oxides, chalcogenides, carbon, nonmetal-oxides have been employed as core and shell materials. The properties of core/shell structures could be tunable based on the material as well as their morphology. As described above, a wide range of combinations of core/shell materials have been developed such as metal/metal, metal/metal oxides, chalcogenides/metal oxide, metal oxide/carbon, etc. Similarly, based on the morphological designs, different types of core/shell structures have been developed, which include the designs such as small-core/thick-shell, large-core/thin-shell, movable-core/shell, multi-core/shell structures. Furthermore, the shape of the core and/or shell has also been varied as cubes, fibers, spiky, feathery, hexagonal, etc. These interesting structures have also been widely studied for photocatalytic applications. The construction of core/shell structured photocatalysts is essentially to have an enhanced charge separation in the system, photosensitization, etc., where the shell material is also often used merely to protect the core-material from chemical and physical modifications during the course of reactions. Such aspects can be seen in the case of metal chalcogenides-based photocatalysts. Metal chalcogenides are realized to have better photocatalytic activity as compared to oxides. However, the key drawback of metal chalcogenides is their poor compositional stability, where they often go through the photocorrosion process that degrades the chalcogenides thereby ultimately reduces the overall photocatalytic efficiency as well as the stability of the catalysts. The compositional instability is essentially an intrinsic characteristic of metal chalcogenides, which should be overcome to exploit their inherent potential properties for any given application. Accordingly, in order to protect from the possible photocorrosion process, metal chalcogenides are often covered with shell materials. For instance, the origin of photocorrosion can be explained in metal sulfide such as CdS can be explained as follows; upon the incident photons, the electrons and holes jump to the conduction band and valence band, respectively, and get transferred to the surface. However, the problem is that the photo-induced holes tend to be accumulated on the outer surface rather than or before being consumed by the electron-donors in the reaction. This in turn subsequently causes irreversible oxidation of surface-bound sulfide ions to sulfur and/or sulfate ions, thereby creating compositional instability in the materials and leading to considerable declines in the photocatalytic process and stability. Meanwhile, it should be noted that the separated holes in metal sulfides often will not be available for the recombination with electrons rather it accumulates on the surface. This essentially indicates that the electrons will be largely available for the photoreduction process. Nevertheless, the accumulation of holes must be taken care of as it severely causes adverse effects. Under such circumstances, the construction of core-shell structures comes handy, where the shell material inhibits the dissociation of surface-ions in the core, thereby enhances the overall photocatalytic and stability properties of the materials. Notably, such protection becomes possible even if both core and shell are formed using metal sulfides. For instance, based on the band edges position of CdS-core and ZnS-shell, the holes created in the VB of CdS-core will be rapidly accepted by default-acceptors in ZnS-shell such as intrinsic defects due to interstitial-sulfur or Zn-vacancies. This eventually enhances the recombination-resistance and anti-photocorrosion properties in the CdS/ZnS core/shell system. Interestingly, a core/shell system keeping Cd as core and ZnO-CdS as the shell has been developed, where it is proposed that the Cd-core channelize the photo induced electrons in CB of ZnO to recombine with the holes in VB of CdS via the Z-scheme mechanism. This essentially prolongs the lifetime of carriers in the system and enhances the photostability along with photocatalytic properties. Through such intriguing mechanisms, the core/shell structures of CdS/TiO2, CdS/ZnS, Cu2S/TiO2, CdSe/TiO2 and CdS/NiO demonstrated H2 evolution at highest rates such 258,526, 68,600, 41,600, 40,600 and 19,900 µmol/g/h, respectively under the irradiation of UV–visible light in vicinity of Na2SO4/Na2S (@0.3 M) as an effective electron donor (Rao et al., 2018; Xitao et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2014; Xie et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014a). Similarly, the systems such as ZnO/ZnS-PdS, Ag2S-coupled ZnO/ZnS, and RGO/ZnO@ZnS yielded the H2 gas at the rate of 2141, 650, and 310 µmol/g/h, respectively when the glycerol was used in the reaction medium under UV–visible light irradiation (Lakshmana Reddy et al., 2018b; Liu, 2016; Huang et al., 2012). The CdSe/ZnS core/shell produced the H2 at a rate of 1194 µmol/g/h in the reaction solution of 35 mM triethanolamine under visible light irradiation (Rao et al., 2020b). The other visible-light-driven systems such as CdS/ZnO, ZnIn2S4@CuInS2, Pt-PdS/CdS, Au@CdS, CdS/ZnS lead to the production of H2 gas at the rate of 354, 1168, 394, 383, 2075 µmol/g/h, respectively in presence of Na2SO4/Na2S sacrificial agents (Yang et al., 2013b; Liu et al., 2013b, 2013a; Chem, 2012; Guo et al., 2020). These observed variations in H2 production efficiencies of these core/shell materials were attributed to their synergistic properties that manifested due to the core/shell structuring as compared to their single counterparts."
2,Benefits of core-shell morphology in photo-excitons separation and corrosion resistance,"1.2 Benefits of core-shell morphology in photo-excitons separation and corrosion resistance Core-shell morphologies are the uniquely compatible structures for a photocatalyst system in the nanoscale size range and they have prevailed considerable attention recently owing to their attractive properties as well as their applications in photocatalysis (Chen et al., 2017b; Shevchenko et al., 2008; Maeda et al., 2006; Co et al., 2014). Several core-shell morphological nanostructures have been prepared by modifying the cores along with the shell material to manifest tunable properties. These modified core-shells play crucial roles in photocatalytic applications, which can be a promising solution for environmental remediation abatement as they have superior photocatalytic stability and recyclability along with an excellent interface charge transfer and light absorption as shown in Fig. 3. In the recent year, the developments of core-shell nanoparticles with metals such as Pt, Pd, Zn, Ni, Au, Ag, etc., or oxides/chalcogenides such as CdS, CdSe, ZnS, Cu2S, CuS, Bi2O3, and In2O3, etc., as the core and TiO2, NiO, ZnS and oxynitrides as the shell have created massive research interests in the area of photocatalysis and solar photovoltaics (Yang et al., 2013d; Bai et al., 2014; Search et al., 2013)."
3,Overview of metal chalcogenides,"1.3 Overview of metal chalcogenides The compounds consisting of one chalcogen as anion and one electropositive cation in their structures are called chalcogenides and they are referred to as oxygen family including sulfides, tellurides, and selenide in their structures. Because of the different chemical behaviors of oxygen in chalcogines, it is often excluded from the “chalcogenide” family. Thus, sulfur (S), selenium (Se), and tellurium (Te) are the other chalcogenides, which find considerable applications. In optoelectronic devices, the S-based materials are widely used and Se-based materials find applications in the biomedical field for imaging. Apart from this, they are also used in sensors and solar cells (Horiuchi et al., 2004; Li et al., 2013a). Similarly, Te-based materials are widely used in infrared detectors and memory devices. Except for noble gases, derivatives of chalcogenide are well cognized for the main group elements. Mostly, stoichiometry follows the classical valence trends as in CdS, CuS, CdSe, SiS2, B2S3, and Sb2S3 (Xiao et al., 2018; Cooper et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2014; Xu and Zhao, 2018). The majority of studied compounds for chalcogens are transition metal chalcogenides, which include zinc (ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe), cadmium (CdS, CdSe, CdTe), MoS2, and mercury-based chalcogenides (HgCdTe) as they form many structures with different stoichiometric compositions. Among these, 1:1 and 1:2 stoichiometries are found to be simple and effective. The Wurtzite structure makes them non-ionic and highly covalent. In the first case, the diamond framework arises by the occupancy of sulfide atoms in cubic symmetry and Zn2+ ions occupy half of the tetrahedral holes. In the second case, viz., the Wurtzite structure, the main atom connectivity is similar (tetrahedral), but the crystal symmetry is hexagonal. Nickel arsenide lattice is the third motive for transition metal chalcogenides, and in this, both metal and chalcogenides having octahedral and trigonal prismatic coordination exist, respectively. Mono-sulfides are a combination of minerals and ores such as chalcopyrite’s (FeS) and pigments (CdS). On the nature of boding configuration with transition metals, the transition metal chalcogenides are again classified into mono- and di-chalcogenides, where the formula for metal mono-chalcogenides (MCs) is MC, where “M” is a transition metal and “C” is S, Se or Te (one of the chalcogenides). On the other hand, the formula for metal dichalcogenides (MDCs) is MC2, where “M” is transition metal and “C” is S, Se, Te. Most MDCs exhibit semiconductor properties and are investigated as cathode materials for the secondary batteries (e.g., TiS2) (Xiao et al., 2018; Li et al., 2014). As a catalyst and solid lubricant, MoS2 is much investigated and has been the widely used material (Guo et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016a; Kadam et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2018). Typically, MDCs adopt either octahedral or trigonal prismatic structure. There is a weak chalcogenide-chalcogenide bonding between the layers, but on the other hand, there is a strong bonding between metal and chalcogenide ligands. The materials with these counterpointing bond strengths made such materials to employ in intercalation by the alkali metals, thereby tunable composition and properties can be manifested in these types of materials (Cooper et al., 2011)."
4,Focus of this review,"1.4 Focus of this review Considering the above mentioned perspectives and what is known from the recent literature, this review is mainly focused to shed lights on the evolution of highly efficient and stable chalcogenides-based photocatalysts for H2 production under visible light, better photoexcitons transfer through an interface, protection of chalcogenide through surface coverage. Furthermore, a detailed survey has been made on the classification of core-shell materials and the advantages of hierarchal nanostructures for photocatalytic applications. It also explores various parameters such as the effect of temperature, solution medium, catalyst loading, optimization of shell thickness and core diameter, electron donors, surfactants, and stability studies, which are essentially playing key roles towards enhancing the photocatalytic properties and especially for H2 generation."
5,Principle of photocatalytic hydrogen generation,"Photosynthesis is a natural phenomenon that exists in plants for the direct generation of hydrogen from the sunlight, where the H2O and CO2 are converted into oxygen and carbohydrates in the presence of sunlight. Based on the above phenomenon, artificial photosynthesis is a similar technology that uses sunlight to convert water into H2 and O2 for the generation of fuels (known as solar fuels), which aims to replicate the natural photosynthesis using man-made materials. In general, the basic water splitting mechanism of photocatalysis is based on the photoexcited charge carriers generated during the photocatalytic reaction. Photocatalysis is a redox process in which the presence of a photocatalyst significantly accelerates the rate of a surface chemical reaction under light irradiation. The photocatalyst is a semiconductor, which generates photo-excitons during illumination of semiconductor particles, possessing sufficient potential for oxidation and reduction reactions, closely associated with the band-edge potential. In general, there are three major steps implied in the process of photocatalytic water splitting reaction on the semiconductor. These three steps include: (i) generation of electrons (e-) and holes (h+) pairs inside the semiconductor particles by the absorption of the incident light, which is having the exceeding bandgap energies of the semiconductor material; (ii) the generated e- and h+ are promoted to conduction and valance band, respectively and followed by the transfer to the interface of the semiconductor particles; (iii) surface chemical reactions among these carriers with different surrounding compounds (e.g., H2O); where the e- and h+ to generate H2 and O2 as depicted in Fig. 4. It is also possible that the recombination of e- and h+ that occurs on a very fast time scale may make these carriers not to participating in any chemical reactions and processes, which fundamentally affects the overall photocatalytic efficiency. In order to accomplish an effective photocatalytic system, the semiconductor photocatalyst materials must have an appropriate band gap, suitable band energy potential, i.e. the bottom level of the conduction band shall be more negative than the reduction potential of H+/H2 (0.0 V versus normal hydrogen electrode), while the top level of the valence band shall be more positive than the oxidation potential of O2/H2O (1.23 V). Although the photocatalytic water splitting process has been regarded as a sustainable approach for clean energy production, it still encounters some major issues as follows; (i) Photocatalysts that satisfy the basic requirements (vide supra) and absorb a visible light spectrum of solar light for water splitting reaction is limited. (ii) Ineffective utilization of photo-generated charge carriers that results in fast recombination, (iii) Poor surface interface reactions between the photocatalysts and reactants in reaction suspension. Hence, researchers have explored several semiconducting materials as well as a combination of materials and practiced new techniques and strategies to overcome the above-mentioned problems. Metal chalcogenides tend to be photo-corrosive in nature, which can be overcome via core/shell photocatalysts as the shell material protects the core-metal chalcogenide from the photocorrosion process (Chen et al., 2017b). Recently, we have proposed a photocorrosion mechanism ( Fig. 5) by comparing the pristine Cu2S and Cu2S/TiO2 core-shell photocatalyst (Navakoteswara Rao et al., 2019). In this study, optical and electrochemical properties were studied, where it was explained that Cu2S generated the photo-excitons by absorbing UV–visible light and resulted in major bulk/surface recombination besides photo-corrosion properties. Minor electron/hole at the surface involves in-situ oxidation and reduction reactions, resulting in H2 generation. On the other hand, core/shell morphology effectively utilized the excitons for the generation of H+ and its subsequent reduction to produce H2 gas. In addition, the direct exposure of Cu2S to the reaction medium is restricted by the core-shell structure, which reduced the recombination significantly."
6,Band edge potential,"2.1 Band edge potential In general, enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction requires desirable band gap energy for efficient water splitting (>+1.23 eV). In addition, conduction and valence band potentials of the semiconductor play a vital role in H2O oxidation and proton reduction reactions. For efficient light absorption, the bandgap structure should allow to absorption of a wide spectrum of solar radiation. To satisfy these conditions, photoelectrodes must have an effective charge transport feature and durable characteristics under wide operating conditions (acidic or basic electrolytes). In a semiconductor, the maximum redox potentials of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs are found by surface band edge positions (Chauhan et al., 2019). In the space charge region (SCR), the oxidation or reduction by holes or electrons requires less power as compared to actual power due to energy loss in the SCR layer. The edge positions of the valence band (Ev) and conduction band (Ec) should satisfy the oxidation/reduction potential of water. For a water-splitting reaction, the semiconductor can act as a photoanode, but it should have the valence band maximum (VBM) below the water oxidation potential and for the semiconductor to act as a photocathode, conduction band minimum (CBM) should lie above the potential of water reduction. Fig. 6 depicts the band edge position and bandgap energy of several semiconductor materials concerning the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) and vacuum energy level (Joe et al., 2019). It is noteworthy that the group III-V semiconductors including GaAs, GaN, and GaInP2 having viable water reduction potential as compared to the group IV materials."
7,Surface active sites and turnover frequency,"2.2 Surface active sites and turnover frequency The photocatalyst surface active sites play a vital role in the superior photocatalytic performance. To assess such properties, the surface characteristics of photocatalysts are widely measured by BET analysis with N2 adsorption and desorption curves. Core-shell photocatalysts tend to have a high specific surface area and the relevant properties as displayed in Fig. 7 toward achieving the enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution efficiencies. Recently, through the N2 adsorption-desorption measurements, our group has demonstrated the surface characteristics of TiO2 shell in CdSe@TiO2 and CdSe nanocomposites (NC). As compared to pristine CdSe, the CdSe@TiO2 core@shell showed high porosity and type IV isotherm due to TiO2 wrapping on the CdSe core as depicted in Fig. 8(a,b). The diameter of the CdSe core was found to be 21 ± 2 nm with enhanced pore-size distribution, where the specific surface area of CdSe NC, as well as the optimized CdSe@TiO2, was estimated to be 2.5 and 10.5 m2/g, respectively. The high surface area of CdSe@TiO2 indicated the availability of a greater number of active catalytic sites on the shell material that essentially triggered the composite towards the enhanced hydrogen fuel generation. In addition, the turnover frequency of the photocatalysts was also estimated to be 0.05018 s−1. The turnover frequency number is generally calculated as, Turnover frequency (TOF)= Amount of product (mol)/(Amount of catalytic active sites x time (s))."
8,"Classification, synthesis, and properties of core-shell nanocomposite photocatalysts",
9,Classification of core-shell nanocomposite photocatalyst,"3.1 Classification of core-shell nanocomposite photocatalyst Based on the valence and conduction band positions, core-shell materials are classified into four types: (i) Type-I, (ii) Type-II, or Reverse Type-II, (iii) Inverse Type-I and (iv) S-Type. 3.1.1 Type-I core/shell structures In Type-I, the bandgap energy of the core materials is lower than the shell materials. The valence and conduction band edges of the core stretch out within the shell bandgap, which confines the charge carriers within the core. Schematic representation displayed in Fig. 9 shows that the valance band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) of the narrow bandgap (eg. CdSe core (1.74 eV)) comfortably lies within the wide bandgap (eg. ZnS shell (3.42 eV)) material. In such type, the separation energy will be less. Accordingly, as compared to the uncoated CdSe, a slower radiative electron-hole recombination was observed in the coated CdSe material validated by observing a slight red shift in the PL emission spectrum (Chauviré et al., 2015; Shao et al., 2014). Recently, Xie et al. reported the Type-I core-shell interaction in mesoporous CdS/ZnS nanocomposite for having improved visible photocatalytic efficiency (Xie et al., 2014). Similarly, many researchers have reported the development of metal chalcogenides with Type-I core-shell interaction for the superior photocatalytic H2 performance (Xitao et al., 2014; Joe et al., 2019; Chauviré et al., 2015). 3.1.2 Type-II core/shell structures In Type II arrangement, the valence and conduction band edge of the core is either lower or higher than the band edges of the shell material. From Fig. 9, for instance, the bandgap energy of ZnTe is around 2.26 eV and the bandgap of CdSe is 1.74 eV, in which the least partition energy of e- and hole will happen when the hole is limited in the ZnTe core valence band, and electron is confined in the CdSe shell conduction band. As indicated by the arrow (Fig. 9), the energy difference between the two occupied states fixes the wavelength emission, which must have lower energy than the individual bandgap. 3.1.3 Inverse Type-I core/shell structures In this type, the shell will have a lower bandgap as compared to the core material, and also, the edges of valence and conduction band of the shell material lie within the core material (Fig. 9). In the shell, if the charge carriers are localized, then there is an occurrence of energy separation in the material. 3.1.4 Step-scheme (S-type)core/shell structures In this type of S-scheme based core/shell photocatalysts as depicted in Fig. 10, the band gap alignment thereby the photo-redox efficiency requires the integration of two semiconductors; one with enhanced oxidation properties (WO3 and Fe2O3) and the other with enhanced reduction properties (CdS, MoS2, CuS, and TiO2). Interestingly, this type of core/shell structure presents hot topics in the field of photocatalysis. Fig. 11 reveals the charge transfer mechanism in Step-scheme from oxidation photocatalyst to reduction photocatalyst. In this mechanism, upon the solar light irradiation, both the oxidation and reduction photocatalysts get excited, where the electrons excited in the oxidation catalyst and the holes formed in the reduction catalyst accumulate at the interfacial space charge region. Meanwhile, the holes in the oxidation catalyst (at VB) and electrons in the reduction catalyst (at CB) are efficiently promoted to the surface and involve in the photo-redox reaction towards performing the photocatalytic process. Consequently, many researchers have developed such S-type heterojunction photocatalysts for the effective photocatalytic hydrogen generation via water splitting (Sun et al., 2018; Chauhan et al., 2019; Joe et al., 2019; Chauviré et al., 2015; Shao et al., 2014; Preethi and Kanmani, 2018; Xu et al., 2015; Abouelhamd et al., 2019; Fu et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2020a; Li et al., 2020; Di et al., 2020)."
10,Synthesis methods for core-shell photocatalysts,"3.2 Synthesis methods for core-shell photocatalysts Generally, depending upon the material's chemical and physical characteristics, the core-shell photocatalysts are prepared in two different routes:(i) single-step method and (ii) two steps method. 3.2.1 Single-step method In this method, both the shell and core precursors are combined in the presence of heat treatment for a particular time to form the core/shell structures. These methods include the hydrothermal, solvothermal, and aqueous phase methods. In our group, we have accounted for the production of CdS/ZnS materials by the hydrothermal method for photocatalytic H2 production. Fig. 12 shows schematics depicting the formation of CdS/ZnS core/shell nanostructures. In this process, firstly, the unvarying dispersion of ZnO, Cd2+,and S2- was obtained by making the solution mixture consisting of CdCl2, ZnO, and thiourea aqueous solutions. During the hydrothermal process, S2- ions from thiourea are combined with Cd2+ ions and leads to the constitution of the CdS solution. Through the nucleation and growth process, the excess S2- ions react with ZnO to form ZnS through replacement reaction. It is noticed that the CdS forms first and then shell ZnS was forming onto the CdS surface. According to the Gibbs free energy variation, Zn2+ hydration ions are higher than the Cd2+ ions, where Cd2+ ions reacted with S2- to form CdS/ZnS core/shell nanostructure. 3.2.2 Two-step method In the two-step method, at first, synthesis of the core material followed by wrapping of shell material will be performed using the solution-based method. To wrap the core with a shell, either the surfactant or non-surfactant mediated synthesis can be employed. Recently, we have prepared the Cu2S/TiO2 by a facile synthetic two-step method to achieve the core-shell nanostructures. Fig. 13 reveals the step-wise formation of Cu2S@TiO2 core-shell. At first, the preparation of Cu2S core was carried out as follows: (i) dissolution of copper precursor in ethylene diamine solution (served as the structure-directing agent), which turns colorless and then into blue color indicated that the copper ions are attached to ethylenediamine (en) in the form of Cu(en)2; (ii) addition of thiourea resulted in a change of color from blue to pale green due to the formation of surface urea complex; (iii) upon continuous magnetic stirring, the formation of black Cu2S got adsorbed with the reaction byproducts onto the hexagonal and spheroids morphologies; (iv) heterostructures of hexagonal and spheroidal shapes with the negative surface charge was obtained. Secondly, during the preparation of a thin layer of TiO2 shell, (v) a positive ion layer was formed on the Cu2S particles by dispersing it in tri-sodium citrate solution; (vi) TTIP was hydrolyzed to form Ti(OH)4 anions and subsequently get adsorbed onto the positive layer of Cu2S; (vii) a thin layer of TiO2 was constituted on Cu2S besides the adsorption of reaction by-products, and (viii) finally the formed product was dried to obtain the clean surface of Cu2S@TiO2 core-shell structure. 3.2.3 Electrospinning method The electrospinning process has been explored for several years and used to prepare a range of core-shell complex structures. This can have a range of supplementary functionalities or improved performance as compared to monolithic fibers from the mono-axial spinning process. Accordingly, to date, the most widely studied processes are coaxial, side-by-side (or Janus), and triaxial electrospinning. The coaxial spinneret was one of the four spinnerets developed by Cooley in 1902, and the other three include (i) traditional single fluid spinneret, (ii) air-assist spinneret, and (iii) the spinneret with rotating the valve distributor. The coaxial electrospinning (or electro-spray) has been further improved during 2002–2003. Moreover, the modified coaxial electrospinning technology is vastly explored and widely adopted in the electrospinning process. Therefore, electrospinning can be a promising technique to prepare the core-shell structured fibers Fig. 14 reveals the preparation of core-shell nanofibers with two co-axial capillaries, where the first co-axial capillary run with core material precursor and second co-axial capillary syringe will contain the shell material to be deposited on the surface of core and Fig. 15(a)–(f) displays the SEM and TEM images with different magnifications (Liu et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020; Xiang et al., 2020; Szilágyi et al., 2013; Doğan et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020)."
11,Various factors influence the efficiency of core/shell photocatalytic materials,"The construction of core-shell architecture has three major challenges such as mono-dispersion of core materials, intact interface contact with shell layer, and uniform wrapping of the core with shell materials. Similarly, literature exploration also accounts that the factors such as nature of precursors or precipitating agents and its concentration, type of solvent, pH of the reaction solution, nature of the surfactants, volume of solution, mixing rate, and reaction temperature (Chaudhuri and Paria, 2012; Gawande et al., 2015; Li et al., 2009) can also significantly affect the photocatalytic attributes of the core/shell structured materials. The ionic charge of surfactants such as anionic, cationic, non-ionic or amphoteric nature plays a vital role towards achieving the formation of mono-dispersed core-shell nanostructures. The interactions of surfactant with the core materials are vital to achieve uniform core-shell structures (as depicted in Fig. 16(a)–(c)) for the superior photocatalytic performances."
12,Effect of morphology,"4.1 Effect of morphology The dimension dependent various morphologies of photocatalyst as shown in Fig. 17 brings a critical function in photocatalysis owing to the momentum of an electron in the particular dimension/direction, where it facilitates an effective redox reaction (Chem, 2012). In general, the 1D(nanorods, nanowires) nanostructures show better performance as compared to 0D nanoparticles, 2D nanobelts, nanosheets, and 3D nano-spherical materials (Liu et al., 2012; Kumar et al., 2017; Kar et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2010). Recently, Cheng et al. (2018) reviewed the CdS-based photocatalysts on their different morphological features and reported their effect on the catalytic performance, governed by the surface-active site as well as surface area due to their morphologies."
13,Temperature effect,"4.2 Temperature effect In the formation of nanostructures, the common parameter that largely determines the kinetics of the reaction is the operating temperature during the synthesis. In general, for the sol-gel reactions, the temperature is not important, whereas it is the most important parameter in the reactions such as polymerizations, precipitation, and decompositions. Notably, thermal decomposition requires a higher operating temperature, but polymerization reaction requires low temperature for better conversion. However, precipitation reaction is marginally different. It is divided into three steps for particle formation: (i) nucleation, (ii) growth, and (iii) agglomeration. These steps determine particle size and the nature of chemical reaction determines the nucleation process, whereas it may be an exothermic or endothermic reaction, wherein the growth process can be more complicated. The nucleation process also depends on the atom diffusion from bulk to the surface. At increased temperatures, the diffusion coefficient increases, but the nature of the reaction determines the product concentration. On the other hand, for an endothermic reaction, the rate of reaction enhances with an increase in temperature and vice versa for an exothermic reaction."
14,Solution medium,"4.3 Solution medium The formation of core-shell morphology depends on reaction intermediates and the pH of the reaction solution. Furthermore, changing the pH of reaction media considerably alters the reduction and precipitation reactions. The highest reduction potential compound can be reduced by a lower reduction potential compound by simply oxidization, which can take place in a redox reaction. In addition, the pH of the medium determines half-cell reduction potential. Therefore, for a controlled reaction to take place and surface modification to happen, a favorable pH is recommended. The pH determines the surface charge of the system, where as the hydrophilic core requires polyelectrolyte (PE) modifiers to obtain uniform shell coating. From the above discussions to increase the impelling force for the uniform coating of the shell, the solution pH seems to encounter a major function towards adsorbing the shell material onto the surface of the core material."
15,Catalyst loading,"4.4 Catalyst loading It is widely encountered that the physicochemical properties such as adsorption and desorption with the reactant solution tend to show exceptional photocatalytic properties, which largely depends upon the concentration of catalyst present in the reaction medium (Lakshmana Reddy et al., 2018c; Praveen Kumar et al., 2013). Based on a literature survey, a few photocatalysts have been optimized to be 3 mg and meanwhile, there are about 10, 20, 30 and 50 mg of photocatalyst have also been reported as the 'optimized' concentration towards achieving the enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen generation ( Fig. 18). Recently, Ravi et al. tuned the loading of CuO/NiO@TiO2 nanocomposite catalyst from 5 to 100 mg, among which, the 20 mg catalyst concentration showed the highest rate of H2 performance in their study (Ravi et al., 2019)."
16,Sacrificial agents,"4.5 Sacrificial agents The selection of the most suitable sacrificial reagent is a very important criterion for the effective photocatalytic H2 generation. This is because the sacrificial reagents encounter a crucial part in the improvement of photocatalytic activity depending upon the chemical and physical properties of the photocatalyst as well asthe nature of the sacrificial reagents. Generally, organic sacrificial agents and inorganic sacrificial agents are the two main classifications of sacrificial reagents. In this context, several organic compounds such as alcohols, hydrocarbons, and organic acids have been employed as hole scavengers (i.e. as e-donors) for the photocatalytic H2 generation reaction. Specifically, methanol, ethanol, glycerol, crude glycerol, tri-ethanolamine, and lactic acid have often been used as sacrificial reagents. The introduction of a small percentage of sacrificial reagents as an e- donor to respond irreversibly with the photo-generated valence band holes can raise the photocatalytically generated electrons, where the hole detachment efficiency eventually results in more eminent quantum efficiencies. Similarly, various inorganic sacrificial reagents, for instance, Na2S, Na2SO3, Na2SO4, Na2S2O3, Na2S2O8 have also been utilized for photocatalytic hydrogen generation, where these inorganic salts used to been employed as hole scavengers (i.e. as e- donors). Importantly, these inorganic salts tend to inhibit the photocorrosive nature of the metal sulfides (CdS, ZnS, etc.) and contribute to enhancing the photocatalytic H2 generation. Especially, sodium sulfides, sodium sulfites, and sodium sulfate are often used as a sacrificial reagent for sulfide based photocatalysts. Table 2 shows the effect of various sacrificial agents employed in the photocatalytic H2 generation reactions."
17,Optimization of shell thickness,"4.6 Optimization of shell thickness The thickness of the shell demonstrates a considerable role in having improved photocatalytic H2 yield owing to the increased charge carrier detachment and protection from the photocorrosion. It has been accounted that the thickness of the shell around 2–20 nm showed efficient excitons separations for the improved photocatalytic H2 generation (Yang et al., 2013b; Tsai et al., 2014). Domen et al., (Sakamoto et al., 2009) examined the effects of shell thickness and concluded that 3–20 nm shell thickness range could be optimum for enhanced photocatalytic H2 production. Xu and co-workers studied the metal@TiO2 (where metal=Au, Pd, and Pt) hierarchical nanohybrid with tunable ultra-thin shells, which exhibited enhanced H2 production (Zhang et al., 2011). Recently, our group (Reddy et al., 2018b) reported a superior photocatalytic H2 production by utilizing CdS/ZnS and concluded that both controlling the core diameter as well as the thickness of the shell significantly influence the effectiveness of the photocatalytic process. Recent reports (Rao et al., 2018; Lakshmana Reddy et al., 2018a) also reveal that the optimal shell thickness for instance in CdS/TiO2 and CdS/NiO core/shell photocatalysts improves the reaction efficiency besides the inhibition of photo-corrosion. For instance, Fig. 19 shows the changes in the concentration of titanium tetraisobutoxide (TTIB) from 0.4 to 1.8 mL lead to having the TiO2 shell with different (increasing) shell thickness as supported by the TEM figures as depicted in Fig. 20. It was thus concluded that shell thickness of 4–15 nm exhibits an efficient light transfer from shell to the core and showed better photocatalytic H2 activity. Similarly, in our recent work, we have demonstrated the ZnS/NiO core/shell structure with varying shell thicnkness as shown in Fig. 21(a)–(i), where the photocatalyst with optimized shell thicnkness showed the highest rate of hydrogen production (Rao et al., 2021) Recent reports on fine-tune optimization of shell thickness of various core/shell structured photocatalysts and their H2 production efficiency are listed in Table 3."
18,Optimization of core diameter,"4.7 Optimization of core diameter As similar to the controlling of shell thickness, controlling the size of the core is also an important parameter in constructing the core/shell materials for enhanced photocatalytic H2 generation. In this direction, we have examined CdS/ZnS core/shell nanostructure, where optimization of the core diameter was carried out by changing the reaction time from 2 to 6 h. Among these, the core/shell prepared at 4 h reaction time ( Fig. 22) showed the better hydrogen production rate due to the controlled and optimum core-to-shell size, which eventually resulted in a better light penetration in the core surface and generation of more number of charge carriers for the enhanced photocatalytic H2 production (Reddy et al., 2018b)."
19,Effect of electron donors,"4.8 Effect of electron donors Researchers have also reported different electron donors as hole capturing reagents. Depending upon the nature of the photocatalysts, different types of scavengers are typically used for photocatalytic oxidation. For example, metal chalcogenides-based photocatalysts generally require include lactic acid, Na2S, Na2SO4, and Na2SO3 as scavengers as it reduces the overall charge recombination in the system as well as photocorrosion in the system. In this context, we (Navakoteswara Rao et al., 2019) have reported various organic and inorganic sacrificial reagents along with their optimizations in photocatalytic H2 generation as shown in Fig. 23. Among our findings, Na2S and Na2SO4 showed a higher rate of H2 production owing to the better absorption and desorption properties of the catalyst as well as control over the photo-corrosion from light irradiation."
20,Stability studies,"4.9 Stability studies Enhancing the photocatalyst quality and stability is a crucial but significant achievement in the development of photocatalysts. In this direction, it is found that the metal chalcogenides-based core/shell photocatalysts show superior photocatalytic stability for long-term usage owing to the shell material that protects the core from the photocorrosion as well as other surface-mediated screening effects. Recently, Guo et al. examined the MoS2, Au@MoS2, and Au@MoS2-ZnO core/shell systems, where their photocatalytic experiments showed a superior H2 performance ( Fig. 24) due to the excellent stability rendered by the core/shell structure (Guo et al., 2016). Similarly, El-Maghrabi et al. reported (El-Maghrabi et al., 2018) the CdS/TiO2@Pt mesoporous (0-D, 1-D) core-shell nanostructures, which exhibited a superior reusable photocatalytic H2 yield under the natural solar light, wherein the authors accomplished four cycles with each of 6 h. The synthesized photocatalysts showed consistent H2 production efficiency due to the core-shell structuring of the photocatalyst. Similarly, from our recent study on the ZnS/NiO core/shell photocatalytic system (Rao et al., 2021) the recyle ability of the photocatalyst with optimized shell thinkness was investigated for five cycles under 1.5 G air mass filter, where it showed a consistent rate of H2 generation of 3.42 mmol h−1 g−1 cat as shown in Fig. 25(a). Further, this recycled ZnS/NiO core/shell photocatalyst was collected and wasted with ultra-pure water and absolute ethanol. Interestingly, from the obtained TEM image (Fig. 25(b)) of this recycled photocatalyst showed that the core/shell morphology was not found to be affected and no significant changes were observed in their structure. Such observation revealed that the synthesized core/shell photocatalyst was stable and structurally efficient."
21,Summary and future perspectives,"The present review addressed the classification of metal chalcogenides and their application in photocatalytic H2 production. Based on the bandgap engineering and subsequent alignments, the core-shell photocatalysts are categorized into three types: Type-I, Type-II, reverse Type-I, and S-Type. The core-shell material preparation with the understanding of stepwise reaction mechanism followed by single or two steps was discussed. Furthermore, a detailed study on the dimension and morphology of the materials was considered, which included the 1D, 2D, and 3D nanostructures that can greatly influence photocatalytic properties and reduce the charge carrier recombination due to their well-defined nanostructures. The analysis of the photocatalytic parameters such as opto-electrochemical, light-harvesting, surface area, optimization shell thickness, core-diameter, the effect of the sacrificial reagent, and recyclability of the core-shell photocatalyst was also discussed.
