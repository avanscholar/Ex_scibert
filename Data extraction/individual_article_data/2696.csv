0,Introduction,"Biodiesel can be produced from a multitude of oil sources such as soybeans, canola, animal fat, palm, corn, waste cooking oil, and jatropha, but these sources suffer from production limitations. Production of single cell oil (SCO) or microbial lipid by oleaginous yeast [1], fungus [2], heterotrophic microalgae [3], and phototrophic microalgae [4] to be used as biodiesel feedstocks have recently gained considerable attention because of potential advantages, namely, high productivity and the ability to use organic waste as carbon and other nutritional sources. Compared with phototrophic algae growth, the heterotrophic growth process has the advantage of growing cells to high density without light limitation. Its main disadvantage, however, is the high cost of feedstock. Thus, exploiting an inexpensive feedstock is absolutely necessary for commercial microbial lipid biofuel production. A variety of organic wastes and wastewater have been investigated as feedstock for dark fermentative hydrogen production [5]. In this process, bacteria first produce sugars by hydrolyzing the organic wastes, and then convert the sugars to hydrogen [6]. Theoretically, one-third of the carbon in glucose is converted to CO2 along with hydrogen production, while the other two-thirds are converted to acetate or butyrate [7]. These volatile fatty acids (VFA) have to be removed in order to avoid potential downstream pollution. To solve this problem, some researchers have converted residue VFAs to valuable products such as methane [8], hydrogen [9,10], or electricity [6,11]. Recently, Chang et al. [12] proposed a VFA platform to utilize organic waste biomass to produce biofuel such as alcohol and ester, or other biochemicals. This research group also did pioneer work on converting VFA to microbial lipids with oleaginous yeast fermentation [13]. In comparison to former processes, oleaginous yeast culture is a mature technology, and lipid biofuel is in surging demand. If the VFA are converted into oil-enriched yeast biomass in an efficient method, this process will reduce biological oxygen demand (BOD) in the effluent and provide feedstock for biofuel production. Such a strategy will greatly improve the economical viability of single cell oil production. Cryptococcus curvatus has been used in large scale cocoa butter substitute production from cheese whey [1]. It can grow on a variety of carbon sources such as glucose, xylose, lactose, glycerol, and ethanol. When ethanol is used as the carbon source, it is usually first converted into acetate. Thus, strains that can grow on ethanol usually can also grow on acetate. In this pathway, acetyl-CoA is synthesized from acetate, and feed into the glyoxylate and tricarboxylic acid cycles to produce oxaloacetate [14]. Culture condition optimization of C. curvatus has been reported in previous research [1,15–17]. However, our preliminary research found that optimal conditions for C. curvatus’ growth with acetate as carbon source was significantly different from that with glucose. For example, pH 5.5 is usually used in glucose culture, but pH 5.5 with acetate resulted in poor growth. Therefore, culture conditions with VFA as carbon sources need to be investigated and optimized. Furthermore, the hydrogen fermentation process which uses bacteria produces many metabolites, and some of them may inhibit yeast growth. Thus, the presence of potential inhibitors in HPE should be examined. Finally, an actual waste stream should be tested to prove the feasibility of this entire waste-to-biofuel process. In this study, optimal pH and acetate concentration was first determined. To test if inhibitors were produced in the fermentative hydrogen production process, sucrose, instead of the actual waste stream, was tested as surrogate for raw waste material, since pure sucrose will not introduce any inhibitor into the hydrogen production process. Finally, food waste was used as an actual example of potential commercial raw material for dark fermentation hydrogen production, and the effluent was tested as a feedstock for lipid production with C. curvatus culture."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Cell strain and medium,"2.1 Cell strain and medium C. curvatus (ATCC 20509), also known as Candida curvata, was used in this research. The seed cells were pre-cultured with a medium composed of 10 g/L dextrose, 1 g/L of yeast extract (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and 1 g/L peptone (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The cells were grown in 250-mL Erlenmeyer flasks, each containing 50 mL of medium and incubated at 25 °C in an orbital shaker set to 170 rpm. Before inoculating into experiment cultures, the seed cells were sub-cultured for 24 h in potassium acetate medium, which contained 10 g/L potassium acetate, 1.0 g/L yeast extract, and 1.0 g/L peptone. The initial pH in that medium was 7.3. The inoculum rate was 5%."
3,Batch cultures without pH control,"2.2 Batch cultures without pH control Basic media for the cultures were same as described in previous work on C. curvatus culture with glycerol [18]. The cells were grown in 250-mL Erlenmeyer flasks, each containing 50 mL of medium and incubated at 30 °C in orbital shakers set to 170 rpm. To test the optimal acetate concentration, eight different concentrations of potassium acetate as shown in Fig. 1 were added to the basic medium, as well as 1.2 g/L ammonium chloride. At the time points shown in Fig. 1, 1 mL of culture broth was taken for optical density (OD) measurement at the wavelength of 466 nm. The initial pH range of 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0 was investigated, in order to test pH effect on cell growth. In these experiments, the basic culture medium was supplemented with 20 g/L potassium acetate and 1.2 g/L ammonium chloride. Three replicates were conducted for each condition. After 24 and 72 hours of culture, 5 mL broth was taken from the cultures, for pH and O.D. measurements (Fig.2a)."
4,pH-stat fed-batch culture in fermentor,"2.3 pH-stat fed-batch culture in fermentor To obtain a more definitive understanding of the pH effect on C. curvatus growth on acetate, three cultures were grown in stirred tank fermentors with precise pH control at 7.00 ± 0.05, 8.00 ± 0.05, and 9.00 ± 0.05. One 1.0-L NBS (Edison, NJ) Bioflo-110 fermentor with a culture volume of 0.5 L, and two other 7.5-L fermentors with culture volumes of 2.0 L were used. The temperature was controlled at 30 °C, and the dissolved oxygen (pO2) was set at 50% saturated air. The aeration rates for the cultures were all set to 1.0 VVM, and the agitation rate control was cascaded to pO2. The desired pH was maintained by adding concentrated feeding medium containing acetic acid (Mallinckrodt Baker Inc., Phillipsburg, NJ). Once the pH reached 0.05 units higher than the set-point, acetic acid medium was automatically added. The feeding medium had a C/N ratio of 49/1, and it contained 700 g/L acetic acid, 21.3 g/L NH4Cl, 4.8 g/L KH2PO4, 1.7 g/LNa2HPO4, 3.6 g/L MgSO4.7H2O, 1.8 g/L yeast extract, 1.8 g/L EDTA, and 178 ml/L spores stock solution. The growth rate of the pH 7.0 culture became very low after 60 h of fermentation, and it was stopped at the 72nd hour. All other cultures were stopped at the same time."
5,Dark fermentation hydrogen production from synthetic wastewater,"2.4 Dark fermentation hydrogen production from synthetic wastewater Sucrose was used as raw material for the fermentative hydrogen production, since the actual waste stream could contain growth inhibitors. The dark fermentation hydrogen production was the same as described by Hu and Chen [19]. Briefly, anaerobic sludge sampled from an anaerobic digester operating at the wastewater treatment plant (Pullman, WA) was pretreated with heat at 105 °C for 2.0 h to inhibit the activity of methanogens. The sludge was then inoculated to the fermentation process for hydrogen production. The fermentation was conducted in a 7.5-L fermentor (NBS Bioflo-110), with a working volume of 5.0-L. The synthetic wastewater contained 20 g/L sucrose, and other nutrients as described in our previous work [19]. The initial pH was 7.5, but it was not controlled during the process. The culture temperature was controlled at 25 °C. When hydrogen production was finished, the effluent was collected and centrifuged to remove the solids, and the supernatant was sterilized by 0.22-μm pore filtration."
6,pH-stat fed-batch culture with hydrogen production effluent (HPE),"2.5 pH-stat fed-batch culture with hydrogen production effluent (HPE) A 1.0-L Bioflo-110 fermentor with culture volumes of 0.5 L was used. Culture temperature was controlled at 30 °C, and pH was controlled at 7.00 ± 0.05. pO2 was set at 50% saturated air with cascading to agitation speed in the range from 300 to 1000 rpm. To test whether any inhibitor was produced, HPE was used as minimal medium, and subsequently supplemented with all of the composites in the basic medium as described in Section 2.2. No carbon source was added to the initial medium, since the HPE contained VFA. With cell growth and VFA consumption, the pH increased gradually. A feeding medium containing acetic acid was fed into the culture for both pH adjustments and nutrient supplementation, as described in section 2.3. After the 96th hour, the culture was fed with acetic acid, but no other nutrients."
7,Hydrogen and VFA production from food waste (FW),"2.6 Hydrogen and VFA production from food waste (FW) Food waste was collected from a student restaurant at Washington State University in Pullman, WA, USA. The FW contained rice, noodles, meat, cream, vegetables, and fruits. The hydrogen production process was conducted in a 7.5-L fermentor (NBS Bioflo-110) with a 2.0 L working culture volume. The medium contained 400 g food waste and 200 mL heat-pretreated anaerobic sludge (as described in Section 2.4). The temperature was maintained at 35 °C. The pH was controlled at 8.0 by automatically adding aliquots of 5 M NaOH. After 7 days of fermentation, FW-HPE was centrifuged to remove the solids and the supernatant was used for yeast culture."
8,C. curvatus culture with FW-HPE,"2.7 C. curvatus culture with FW-HPE The supernatant of FW-HPE was used as initial medium for C. curvatus culture. The culture was conducted in 1-L fermentor (NBS Bioflo-110), with pO2 at 50% and temperature at 30 °C. 50 mL of sub-cultured seed cells were inoculated into 500 mL of medium. However, the cells did not grow in medium made from FW-HPE. To prevent this inhibition from occurring, another culture was established with an initial medium that did not contain FW-HPE, but which was continuously feed FW-HPE after 24 h. The initial medium contained 10 g/L dextrose, 3 g/L yeast extract, 3 g/L malt extract, and 5 g/L peptone. After 24 h, sterilized FW-HPE was fed at a constant dilution rate of 0.86 d−1. The pH was maintained at 8.0 by automatically adding aliquots of 2N HCl."
9,Analytical procedures,"2.8 Analytical procedures 2.8.1 Dry cell weight (DCW) and fatty acids analysis To determine cell dry weight, a 5-mL cell suspension sample was centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellet was then washed twice with distilled water and dried in a pre-weighed aluminum dish at 105 °C for 3 h. For the fatty acids analysis, yeast cells were harvested and freeze-dried. The method of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) preparation and gas chromatography (GC) analysis were the same as described previously [20]. 2.8.2 VFA analysis Concentrations of VFA in the fermentation broth were analyzed via headspace gas chromatography (HS-GC) analysis [21]. 2.8.3 Biogas analysis The contents of biogas were measured using a GC (Varian Inc.) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a FID. An 18′ × 1/8′ (inside diameter) Silcosteel column packed with HayeSep Q (80–100 mesh) was used to separate CO2 and CH4. TCD and FID detector temperatures were maintained at 150 and 225 °C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 30 mL/min. 2.8.4 Analysis of food waste and HPE The chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen, and ammonia nitrogen were analyzed by a direct reading spectrophotometer model DR/2400 (HACH Company). Lipid in food waste was extracted by the Bligh-Dyer method from the acidified sample, and was then measured gravimetrically after the solvent was evaporated at 80 °C. Total solids (TS), and total volatile solids (TVS) were analyzed according to Standard Methods [22]. Carbohydrate was measured by the phenol-sulfuric acid method with glucose as standard [23]. The total protein content of sludge was estimated from the corresponding Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) concentration [24]. Total residue sugar in HPE was analyzed with an Anthrone solution (Fluka Biochemica, Buchs, Switzerland)."
10,Results,
11,The effect of potassium acetate concentration on cell growth,"3.1 The effect of potassium acetate concentration on cell growth Fig. 1 shows the effect of potassium acetate concentration on C. curvatus’ growth, as well as corresponding pH variation during the culture process. Cultures with 10 g/L potassium acetate obtained the highest OD between the 12th and the 24th hour. Compared to 10 g/L, there was a slight inhibition in the 20 and 40 g/L cultures during the first 24 h, but these cultures resulted in much higher OD thereafter. The cultures with 60 g/L and 100 g/L potassium acetate resulted in lower ODs, and were visibly inhibited. In order to avoid inhibition, it is concluded that the concentration of potassium acetate should be no greater than 40 g/L. The pH increased rapidly in all cultures due to the consumption of acetic acid (Fig. 1 b). The cultures with 20 g/L and 40 g/L potassium acetate reached pH 9.0 in 24 h. All of the cultures with 5 g/L potassium acetate or more resulted in a final pH greater than 9.3. The 20 g/L potassium acetate culture resulted in the highest final pH, which was 9.7."
12,The effect of initial pH on yeast growth,"3.2 The effect of initial pH on yeast growth Same as what happened in acetate gradient experiments above, the pH in all of the cultures with initial pH from 7.0 to 9.0 increased to 8.5–9.0 within 24 h, and the final pH was approximately 9.7 (data not shown). All of the cultures produced <0.2 g/L of dry cell weight at the 24th hour (Fig. 2 a), indicating that most of the biomass was produced when the pH was greater than 9. The culture with initial pH of 7.0 reached the highest production of biomass at 0.63 ± 0.15 g/L DCW at 72nd hour (Fig. 2a). However, this yield is very low for a yeast culture process, and it should be attributed to the high pH."
13,pH-stat fed-batch culture,"3.3 pH-stat fed-batch culture Of all pHs investigated in the pH-stat cultures, pH 7.0 resulted in the highest production of 68.8 g/L DCW and 37.0 g/L total fatty acids at the 72nd hour (Fig. 2). This led to a final average DCW productivity of 0.96 g/L/h and a final average lipid productivity of 0.51 g/L/h. The lipid content after the 36th hour was between 53.8% and 64.4%. The pH 6.0 culture produced both lower DCW and lipid than that with pH 8.0. The culture with pH 9.0 had the lowest growth of 8.0 g/L DCW and 3.90 g/L lipid, indicating that this culture was severely inhibited. It can be deduced from these results that all previous cultures in flasks without pH control were inhibited. The pH 8.0 culture resulted in 44.8 g/L DCW and 29.2 g/L lipid, with a lipid content between 53.4% and 67.1% after the 36th hour. The pH 8.0 culture also resulted in a higher final lipid content of 65.1%, which is significantly higher than the 53.8% of the pH 7.0 culture. Interestingly, the pH 8.0 culture had a longer lag phase than that of pH 7.0, which led to a lower average productivity for the process. However, the maximum productivities of pH 7.0 and pH 8.0 during logarithmic growth phase were similar. The biomass productivity of pH 7.0 between the 36th hour and the 48th hour was 1.58 g/L/h, and that of pH 8.0 between the 48th hour and the 65th hour was 1.64 g/L/h. The fatty acid profiles from different cultures are summarized in Table 1 . C16:0, C18:0, C18:1, and C18:2 are the major fatty acids in the yeast biomass. C18:1 accounted for 36.3%–46.5% of the total fatty acids. The pH 6.0 and pH 7.0 had similar fatty acids profiles. In comparison, pH 8.0 had a higher concentration of C18:0, and pH 9.0 had a higher concentrations of C16:0 and C18:2, with a lower percentage of C18:1. This latter result was probably due to the slow growth in pH 9.0 culture, since it was found in this experiment that the percentage of C18:2 in the early phase of growth was high, but decreased gradually (data not shown). This phenomenon was also reported in a study on C. curvatus culture with glycerol as carbon source [18], which resulted in a similar final fatty acid profile as that of pH 7.0 in this study."
14,C. curvatus culture with HPE and fed with acetic acid,"3.4 C. curvatus culture with HPE and fed with acetic acid The result of hydrogen production from synthetic wastewater is shown in Table 2 . The hydrogen production was 0.36 L/L broth, and no methane was produced. The yield of hydrogen from sucrose was 18.0 mL/g, which is very low. This is probably because of the uncontrolled pH in this experiment, which decreased rapidly and led to a final value lower than 3.0. Although most of the sucrose was consumed (final sucrose concentration was 0.16 ± 0.03 g/L), only a small part was converted into VFA. The final total VFA concentration was 3.01 ± 0.43 g/L. The COD in HPE was 14.7 ± 0.5 g/L, indicating that a large part of sucrose was converted to other compounds, rather than VFA. Since all carbon source concentrations in HPE are very low (Table 2), using HPE as sole carbon source would result in a low biomass production, and under such circumstances it may not be possible to ascertain if an inhibitor exists. Therefore, acetic acid was fed to this culture, and most of biomass in this fed-batch culture was produced from the acetic acid. In the first 60 h, the culture obtained a production rate similar to the pH 7.0 culture in section 3.3, which is used as the control for this HPE culture. This result indicated that no inhibition existed in the HPE culture (Fig. 3 ). After the 60th hour, the feeding rate in the control culture significantly slowed and produced 68.8 g/L DCW at the 72nd hour, but the HPE culture kept growing, and produced 70.8 g/L DCW at the 72nd hour. After the 84th hour, its growth rate also slowed, but its biomass production increased until it reached 168 g/L at the 192nd hour. The maximum average productivity of dry cell weight was 1.11 g/L/h at the 84th hour, and the final average productivity was 0.88 g/L/h. After the 96th hour, only acetic acid was fed into the culture, and this led to a C/N ratio greater than 50/1 since nitrogen became depleted during the culture. This result led to a very high lipid content in the yeast biomass after the 96th hour, which was between 75.0% and 77.5%. The maximum average lipid productivity was 0.73 g/L/h at the 130th hour, and the final average productivity was 0.66 g/L/h. These results demonstrated that no inhibitor was produced in the hydrogen production process, and that HPE was a good feedstock for C. curvatus culture, when supplemented with acetic acid. The fatty acid profile analysis showed that the concentration of C16:0 in HPE culture was 22.4%, which was significantly higher than the control culture (Table 1)."
15,Hydrogen and VFA production from food waste,"3.5 Hydrogen and VFA production from food waste The characteristics of food waste feedstock are shown in Table 3 . The TS and TVS in the food waste was 31.67 ± 0.31% and 29.98 ± 0.30%, respectively. The food waste contained a high concentration of protein at 93.4 ± 8.6 g/L and which accounted for 29.5% of the TS. To obtain a high concentration of VFA in HPE, the pH was controlled at 8.0. After 7 days of fermentation, 19.5 ± 2.3 g/L VFA was obtained (Table 4 ). This was much higher than the production rate of 4–8 g/L VFA by anaerobic digestion of food waste at pH 5.0 to 6.0 [25,26]. The major components of VFA were acetic and butyric acids, as well as a minor concentration of propionic acid. The high percentage of acetic and butyric acids favors hydrogen production because a high hydrogen yield is associated with acetic and butyric acids as fermentation end-products [27]. The gas production was 25.5 ± 3.8 L/L broth and it was mainly composed of H2 and CO2. The percentage of H2 and CO2 was 69% and 31%, respectively. The hydrogen yield from food waste was 289 ± 44 mL/g VS. No methane was detected during the fermentation; this indicated that methanogens were completely inhibited by heat pretreatment and therefore VFA was not consumed by these microbial species. In addition, 2.4 ± 0.4 g/L ammonia nitrogen was produced during this process."
16,Continuous culture of C. curvatus by feeding with FW-HPE,"3.6 Continuous culture of C. curvatus by feeding with FW-HPE FW-HPE as the initial medium resulted in poor cell growth (data not shown), indicating that inhibitor(s) exists in the FW-HPE. To eliminate the inhibiting effect at the early stage of cell growth, synthesized medium with glucose was used as initial medium, and FW-HPE was fed into the culture continuously after 24 h. This method maintained the inhibitor at a relatively low concentration and resulted in significant cell growth. As shown in Fig. 4 , glucose was essentially consumed after 24 h of culture. With the addition of HPE, yeast biomass was produced continuously. The growth reached steady state after 64 h where the dry cell weight was between 9.1 and 9.5 g/L. The lipid production from the 76th to the 82nd hour was stable at about 1.28 g/L. At the steady state, the productivity of dry cell weight was 0.34 g/L/h, and the lipid productivity was 0.046 g/L/h. The pH was controlled at 8.0 in this culture, since the lipid content in cultures at pH 8.0 was higher than at pH 7.0 (Fig. 2). However, the total lipid content in the produced biomass was very low, only 13.8% at the 76th hour and 13.5% at the 82nd hour. This result was probably because the C/N ratio in the FW-HPE was too low (only 3.2/1), which is not favorable for lipid production. The conversion rate of VFA to yeast biomass at steady state was 48.2%–50.6%. The COD in the effluent of yeast culture remained high, between 5.65 g/L at the 70th hour and 4.75 g/L at the 82nd hour, but the VFA content was very low. The total nitrogen in the effluent decreased from 2.8 g/L (Table 4) to 1.0 g/L."
17,Discussion,"This study investigated oleaginous yeast culture with hydrogen production effluent (HPE) as the feedstock and demonstrated the feasibility of such a process. It was also shown that VFA (using acetic acid as an example) can be a recommended feedstock for C. curvatus’ culture. A pH-stat culture maintained at pH 7.0 by feeding acetic acid produced 68.8 g/L dry cell weight and 37.0 g/L lipid in a 72 h culture process. HPE from synthetic wastewater (with sucrose as carbon source) was tested as an initial medium, and the results showed that no inhibitor to yeast growth was produced during the hydrogen production process. Feeding the HPE culture with acetic acid produced 168 g/L biomass, with a lipid content of 75.0%. Food waste was tested as an example of commercial organic waste feedstock. It was found that HPE generated from food waste contains inhibitor(s) to C. curvatus growth, but the inhibition could be avoided by first growing the yeast with a synthesized medium and then feeding with FW-HPE. The biomass productivity in the continuous culture was 0.34 g/L/h, which was comparable to 0.88 g/L/h in fed-batch culture. However, the lipid content in the produced biomass was low, probably because the C/N ratio in FW-HPE was low due to the high protein content in food waste. This result suggests that food waste alone is not a recommended feedstock. However, it is predicted that if raw materials with low nitrogen, such as woody biomass and agricultural straws, are included in this two-step process, then this culture system could be very viable. When acetate was used as carbon source, the optimal culture conditions for C. curvatus were quite different from that with glucose and glycerol, and pH had a significant effect in such a culture system. When glycerol [18] and sugar [28] were used as carbon sources and pH was controlled at 5.5, biomass production reached more than 100 g/L. However, at the same pH, when cultured with potassium acetate and fed with acetic acid, a severe inhibition occurred and there was only minor growth (data not shown). A change to a pH of 7.0 or 8.0 supported satisfactory cell growth in the pH-stat fed-batch culture, but pH 6.0 and pH 9.0 resulted in severe inhibition (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that a more restricted pH is required when acetate is used as carbon source, and here the optimal pH is about 7.0. It was also found in this study that higher concentration of potassium acetate requires higher pH to support cell growth. For example, a culture with 60 g/L potassium acetate without pH control resulted in a final pH of 9.5, and it produced 3.86 g/L DCW (calculated from the measured OD in Fig. 1). When pH was automatically controlled at 9.0, the culture produced only 0.86 g/L DCW. When pH was controlled at 7.0, the culture produced even less DCW at 0.33 g/L (data not shown). This indicates that only pH higher than 9.0 can support significant cell growth in 60 g/L potassium acetate culture, and higher pH led to relatively higher biomass production. However, 40 g/L potassium acetate culture at pH 7.0 produced much higher DCW than pH 9.0, indicating that a lower pH was better for culture with 40 g/L potassium acetate (Fig. 2). Thus, there is strong correlation between effects of acetate concentration and pH. Similar result was also observed during our preliminary work with a central composite design, in which initial pH had strong correlation with acetate concentration (data not shown). The inhibition caused by acetic acid was also reported during the culture of other microorganisms. For example, Sugimoto et al. [29] reported that when acetate was used as the carbon source, the optimal sodium acetate concentration for Alcaligenes eutrophus’ growth was around 1.0 g/L, and serious inhibition occurred by either an increase or decrease in acetate concentration. Also, Ratledge et al. [30] found that substrate inhibition occurred if the sodium acetate concentration was higher than 8 g/L in cultures of the heterotrophic algae Crypthecodinium cohnii. Compared with these microorganisms, substrate inhibition by acetate in C. curvatus culture was mild, and there was only slight inhibition in the culture with 40 g/L potassium acetate. Acetic acid can be transported across the cell membrane of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae either by an acetate-proton symport system or by simple diffusion of undissociated acetic acid [31,32]. In this study, all of the cultures had a pH higher than 6.0. Since the pKa of acetic acid is 4.76, the predominant acetic acid species at this pH is the acetate anion. Thus, transport across the cell membrane should be through the acetate-proton symport mechanism. This may explain why high acetate concentrations require higher pH, since less acetate would be imported into the cell when the pH is low. However, a complete explanation for the inhibitory effect caused by high concentration of acetate is yet to be determined. It is interesting that inhibition occurred in the culture with HPE from food waste, but not with HPE from synthetic wastewater. Food waste is used in this study because it is in plentiful supply. For example, it has been estimated that more than 96 billion pounds of edible food was lost by retailers, foodservices, and consumers in the USA in 1995 [33]. However, food for human consumption contains a high concentration of protein, which leads to high ammonia and nitrogen concentrations in the HPE (Table 4). A high concentration of ammonia is an inhibitor for methanogenesis [34–36] and hydrogen production [37]. It has been reported that ammonia nitrogen concentrations between 1.5 and 3.0 g/L had significant adverse effects on methanogenic activity above pH 7.4. Moreover, inhibition occurred at all pH levels when its concentration was above 3.0 g/L [38,39]. The initial ammonia nitrogen concentration in FW-HPE used in this study was 2.4 ± 0.4 g/L (Table 4), and thus it might be an inhibitor to yeast growth. The high concentration of nitrogen is also not favorable for lipid accumulation, which usually requires high C/N ratios between 30/1 and 80/1 [16]. Thus, food waste alone is not a recommended feedstock for lipid production in this process. A variety of waste streams with high carbohydrate, but which are nitrogen-deficient, can serve as better feedstocks for this process. Example feedstocks include wastewaters from sugar and starch factories, rice bran, and carbohydrate rich high solid organic wastes [5]. Cellulosic feedstocks such as straws, woodchips, grass residues, paper wastes, and saw dusts are widely used in hydrogen production [40]. These feedstocks usually contain a very low nitrogen content, and could serve as ideal feedstocks for oleaginous yeast culture. In summary, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using HPE as feedstock for microbial lipid production, which subsequently can be used as feedstock for biofuel production. Such a process provides an alternative approach to recover the energy and organic carbon from HPE. The COD in FW-HPE was reduced from 43.7 g/L to 5.0 g/L in this study, indicating that most of the COD can be removed. The residual COD in the effluent can be further removed by regular wastewater treatment methods and discharged safely. Although the overall productivity of this continuous culture process is still low, it may be greatly improved by cell recycling or cell retention perfusion culture. It is notable that this approach is still in its infancy, but holds much commercial promise."
18,Conclusion,"VFA was shown to be a favorable feedstock in C. curvatus culture for lipid production, and C. curvatus’ culture with HPE from synthetic wastewater demonstrated that no inhibitor to C. curvatus growth was produced in the hydrogen production process. Although FW-HPE contained inhibitor(s), it successfully supported C. curvatus growth in continuous culture. However, the lipid content of produced biomass was low due to the high nitrogen concentration in FW-HPE. Nitrogen-deficient raw materials are suggested to be more suitable feedstocks for this two-step biohydrogen and lipid co-production process."
