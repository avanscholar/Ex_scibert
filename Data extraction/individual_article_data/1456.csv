0,Introduction,"With the development of society, the demand for energy becomes an urgent need. Many aspects of energy-storage technologies have been explored to facilitate the use of sustainable energy sources [1,2]. Among these technologies, Li–O2 battery has been regarded as one of the most promising, because of its high theoretical energy density of ∼3500 Wh kg−1 [3]. But there are still numerous issues impeding the utilization of Li–O2 batteries in practical use [4,5]. Owing to their sluggish kinetics, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) show large overpotentials, low energy and coulombic efficiency [6,7]. The performance of a Li–O2 battery relies on the reaction between lithium ion and oxygen. A good cathode should allow the diffusion of lithium ions and oxygen, and also favor the reversible Li2O2 formation and storage during the process of discharge [8,9]. Porous carbons are the most widely used platform for air cathodes [10,11], as they generally offer good conductivity, light weight, large surface area, tunable porosity, and low cost and abundant, often renewable, sources for its production [12,13]. Bacterial cellulose (BC) is a bio-based polymer produced from a microbial fermentation process [14,15], which is employed in a wide range of applications from health to electronics [16,17]. BC as carbon source has raised great attention, owing it to its sustainability, relative low cost, three-dimensional structure, high surface area and accessible porosity [18,19], which are ideal for electrodes in energy storage devices. As-prepared BC is a hydrogel, thus thermal carbonization requires a drying step. The drying route applied considerably modifies the morphology, surface area and porosity of the BC, therefore it can influence the properties of the resulting carbons [20,21]. In fact, when the gel is dried by simple water evaporation in air at room or oven temperature, the strong capillary forces collapse the pores of the cellulose network, which induces fibril aggregation known as hornification, resulting in a low porosity material. Freeze-drying, spray-drying and supercritical drying are often used to hinder hornification [22,23], increasing the surface area of cellulose and producing porous structures. Such porous cellulose has been successfully employed to produce carbons with a nanofibrous structure that replicates the nanocellulose network [18,24]. However, the drying methods applied are generally time- and energy-consuming and require expensive facilities than simple oven drying. Therefore these methods do not represent a remarkable advantage over more conventional methods to introduce and control porosity of biomass-derived carbons, as it is the case of chemical activation by corrosive compounds [25,26], addition of templating agents [27], or hydrothermal synthesis [28]. On the other hand, some authors reported that using compatible solvents with low surface tension, such as alcohols, could relieve the occurrence of a compacted structure's cellulose [29,30]. We show here a facile and low-cost method to prepare porous carbons from food store commercial BC after a simple alcohol treatment. The obtained carbon microstructure is not a replica of the cellulose and suggests some intermediate melting step in the pyrolysis process. Nevertheless, the porosity of carbon derived from alcohol-treated BC is remarkable and used as oxygen cathodes in Li–O2 batteries showed an outstanding capacity and good cycle life. These results not only show a more economic and sustainable route for the preparation of porous carbons, but the striking variations of carbon porosities and electrochemical performance obtained from the same cellulose modified just by controlling fiber aggregation also provide an interesting insight into the carbonization process."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Bacterial cellulose (BC, Q-Phil Products International), methanol (Scharlau), ethanol (99%, Panreac), 1-propanol (99.7%, Sigma Aldrich), 1-butanol (99.5%, Labkem), 1-hexanol (≥99.9%, Sigma Aldrich), 1-octanol (≥99.9%, Sigma Aldrich), ether (≥99.9%, Sigma Aldrich), acetone (99%, Panreac), Tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether ether (TEGDME, ≥97.0%, Sigma Aldrich), N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP, Sigma Aldrich), lithium triflate (99.95%, Sigma-Aldrich), bis(2-methoxy ethyl)ether (Diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, DEGDME, 99.95%, Sigma-Aldrich), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, Sigma-Aldrich), carbon black (Super P, Timcal), lithium foil (Sigma-Aldrich, 0.4 mm thick), carbon paper (Freudenberg, H2315, 210 μm thick), glass fibre filter (PRAT DUMAS, 270 μm thick)."
3,Preparation of carbons,"2.2 Preparation of carbons BC processing: Food-grade BC was in the form of cubes (approx. size 15 × 15 × 15 mm3) immersed in sucrose syrup. Cubes were drained and placed in Milli-Q water under stirring for 3 h, this process was repeated twice to remove the absorbed syrup and a final step of 12 h. Then, the BC cubes were autoclaved at 120 °C for 20 min. To replace water with other solvents, one piece of BC was pressed by a Teflon cylinder (150 g) for 10 min. The squeezed BC was then soaked in a beaker with 10 mL of a given solvent and stirred for 2 h at room temperature. Afterward, the soaked BC was briefly drained of excess solvent and placed without pressing in an oven to dry (60 °C, 24 h). Finally, dried BC was carbonized in a tubular furnace under an Ar flow of 100 mL min−1 with a ramp of 10 °C min−1 to 900 °C and kept there for 1 h."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The water and alcohol-soaked BCs, were tested by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR). The measurements were carried out by Spectrophotometer Jasco 4700 equipment. The scan range was 400–4000 cm−1. All scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained by FEI Quanta 200 FEG-ESEM equipment at 15 kV acceleration voltage, 10 mm working distance. Cross-sections were obtained by dipping samples in liquid nitrogen and then, cutting them with a blade. All samples were placed on an aluminum holder with adhesive carbon tape. For transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, samples were sonicated in ethanol for a few seconds and dropped on carbon-coated copper grids. TEM images were obtained by JEOL JEM1210 TEM with an ORIUS 831 SC 600 (Gatan camera) at 120 kV. N2 adsorption/desorption measurements were conducted by Micromeritics ASAP 2020 equipment. The outgas conditions were at 120 °C for 12 h. The thermal properties of dried BCs were investigated by a TGA-DSC/DTA analyzer (NETZSCH STA 449 F1 Jupiter). The thermal conditions were 10 °C min−1 (ramp), 1000 °C (final temperature) and Ar atmosphere. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all samples were performed by Siemens D-5000 equipment with Cu Kα radiation. Tests were carried out in a 2θ range of 10–90°. The crystallinity index (CI) of BCs was calculated by the following equation: CI=(I110-Iam)/I110 (1) where I110 is the intensity of the peak at 22.5° for the crystalline part of cellulose type I and Iam is the intensity of the peak at about 18° for the amorphous part [31]."
5,Electrochemical performance,"2.4 Electrochemical performance A slurry was prepared by gently grinding carbon samples in a mortar and mixing with PVDF (8:2 carbon/PVDF w/w) and few drops NMP. The slurry was then casted on a 10 mm diameter carbon paper (Freudenberg H2315). Then, the coated carbon paper was put in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 24 h to remove NMP. The mass loading of air cathode is about 1 mg cm−2. The Li–O2 battery is composed of 3 parts, carbon paper, glass fibre filter and Li foil. A 1 M lithium triflate solution in DEGDME was used as the electrolyte. The Li–O2 batteries were assembled in an Ar filled glove box (H2O < 0.1 ppm, O2 < 0.1 ppm). All the tests were carried out in 1 atm dry O2 to avoid the effect of CO2 and humidity. The cycle voltammetry measurements were conducted at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 in the range of 2.0–4.5 V (versus Li/Li+) by a Bio-logic VMP3 multichannel potentiostat. Galvanostatic discharge/charge tests were performed by a battery cycling equipment (MTI BST8-WA). The estimation of the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) was based on the evaluation of the electrochemical double-layer capacitance and performed in a three-electrode system with a 1 M lithium triflate in DEGDME electrolyte after Ar bubbling. Carbon-coated carbon paper prepared as described above, with a mass loading of about 0.2 mg was used as the working electrode. Platinum wires were used as the counter and the reference electrode. The measurements were conducted at 2 mV s−1 in a narrow potential range. The electrochemical double-layer capacitance CEDL was obtained by the following equation [32]: (2) C E D L = ∫ i V d V / ( 2 v m △ V ) where i is the current, V is the potential, m is the mass of carbons, ν is the scan rate, ΔV is the potential range. The ECSA is given by the [33]: ECSA = CEDL/C∗ (3) where C∗ is the specific capacitance (F m−2) of a bare glassy carbon electrode in the same electrolyte. A C∗ value of 14.06 μF cm−2 was determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, Fig. S5)."
6,Results and discussion,"As reported by previous literature [29,30], alcohol treatments contribute to better preserve porous structures in dried cellulose reducing the degree of hornification. We tested several solvents as water replacement of the bacterial cellulose hydrogel, focusing in particular on aliphatic alcohols of different chain lengths, carbonized and tested as electrodes in Li/O2 batteries. As summarized in Table S1, the poorest results are obtained with water, which seems to confirm the effect of the high surface tension. Other parameters, such as solvent volatility may also play a role in the pore formation and could help explaining differences between alcohols. To better understand the impact that the replacement of water in the hydrogel for an organic solvent we focused on the characterization of the preparative steps of the carbons obtained from untreated (BC-w), ethanol (BC-e) as a reference alcohol treatment and 1-butanol treated cellulose (BC-b) which present the best electrochemical results. The cleaned, cubic-shaped BC hydrogels were pressed to about 10% of the original height to remove the majority of the entrapped water. Pressed BCs were then soaked in the different alcohols and stirred for 2 h. During this time, the BC cubes swelled to recover more than 90% of the original size in ethanol and more than 70% in the case of 1-butanol. FTIR spectra of soaked BC are similar to those of the pure solvents, which is consistent with complete solvent substitution (Fig. S1a and Figure S1c-d). The alcohol treatment does not chemically alter BCs, according to FTIR spectroscopy of dried BCs (Fig. S1b and Fig. S1c-d). In fact, dried BCs show typical cellulose peaks, which can respectively be ascribed to the stretching vibration of O–H (3350 cm−1), H–C–H (2900 cm−1), C–O–C (1427 cm−1) [34], with no apparent difference between them, which also proves the quantitative solvent removal in the three cases. The SEM image (Fig. S2) of BC-w shows a smooth surface, which demonstrates that fibrils have compacted. The cross-section SEM images (Fig. 1 a–c) show that the layers of BC-w are more densified in comparison with BC-e and BC-b. This confirms that the treatment of ethanol and 1-butanol reduce interfibrillar contraction. The morphology differences between BC-w, BC-e can be attributed to the following factors. On the one hand, the much smaller surface tensions of ethanol and 1-butanol (Table S1), which decrease the capillary force effects as compared to water during the solvent evaporation [29,35]. Low surface tensions of ethanol and 1-butanol result in weaker capillary forces during the process of drying. The fibrils under weak capillary forces move less than under stronger capillary forces resulting from water, barely changing the distance between fibrils. On the other hand, ethanol and 1-butanol can attach to the surface of fibrils via hydrogen-bond [36,37]. As a consequence, the self-association behavior of fibrils can be limited by the steric hindrance of the aliphatic chains of ethanol and 1-butanol, which act as a spacer. Initially weaker and finally repulsive forces will be present among fibrils, preventing their cohesion. Therefore, highly porous structures can be achieved by ethanol and even more by 1-butanol treatment for BC. The porous structures of dried BCs were further verified by nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements (Fig. 1d). All three isotherms present hysteresis and could be considered of mixed type II and IV. Pore size distributions (Fig. 1e) mainly range in the mesoporous region, with a macropore contribution in the case of alcohol-treated samples, while micropores are scarce in all three samples. Dried BC-w presents small area and porosity (BET specific surface area 21 m2 g−1 and cumulative pore volume 0.11 cm3 g−1, Table 1 ). In contrast, BC-e and BC-b have respectively over four and five times larger surface areas and pore volumes. These increments agree with the textured structure observed by SEM in BC-e and BC-b. The pore size distributions (Fig. 1e) of all dried BCs are dominated by mesopores, but BC-e and BC-b have larger predominant pore sizes than BC-w. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to study the effect of alcohols on the crystallinity of BCs. Fig. 1g depicts that all BCs show typical pattern peaks (14.5° and 22.5°) of cellulose type I, which correspond to the (100) and (110) lattice planes respectively [39]. Comparing with the crystallinity of BC-w (78%), the crystallinity of BC-e (66%) and BC-b (70%) decreases slightly. The decrease in crystallinity suggests that the cellulose becomes more disordered and loosen, which can be attributed to the effect of dissociation of the hydrogen bonds between cellulose [40]. To explore the effect of the fiber aggregation on the carbonization process, all dried BCs were subjected to Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) under Ar (Fig. S3a). There are two major mass losses during the temperature ramp. The first small mass loss step (25–100 °C) can be attributed to the evaporation of residual absorbed water [41]. The loss is larger for BC-w (2.5%) than for alcohol-treated samples (0.9% for BC-e and 0.1% for BC-b). This can be considered a proof that a large part of the most tightly bound water molecules was removed during the alcohol treatment. The second mass loss step occurred at 200–400 °C, corresponding to BC decomposition and carbonization. During this step cellulose depolymerizes and fragments on variable molecular weight forms, giving place to char, tar, and volatile compounds (such as water, carbon dioxide and monoxide, acetic acid, and different saccharides) [42]. The yield of these solid, liquid and gaseous fractions has a strong influence on the subsequent carbonization process. The DSC curves (Fig. S3b) indicated that the temperatures for the first major decomposition peaks of BC-e (286 °C) and BC-b (297 °C) are lower than BC-w (322 °C). This can be related to the lower crystallinity of BC-e and BC-b, which can facilitate the degradation process of BCs [43]. In addition, carbon yields (Fig. S3a) of BC-e (9%) and BC-b (10%) are lower than BC-w (14%), probably because of the smaller pores of BC-w. These smaller pores retain more strongly the pyrolysis liquid intermediates, which are also involved in cross-linking and char formation [44]. The impregnation of a less porous system implies a smaller liquid-gas interface and a stronger liquid-solid interaction, reducing the intermediate volatilization and increasing char production, resulting in a larger carbon yield [42,44]. The presence of liquid intermediates is evident from the textures observed after carbonizing dried BCs at 900 °C in Ar. Carbon originated from water-treated BC (carbon-w) presents a compact vitreous morphology (Fig. 2 a), which implies that their pores only correspond to narrow gaps between components of carbon-w. In contrast, carbons derived from ethanol (carbon-e) and 1-butanol (carbon-b) present evident porous structures (Fig. 2b and c), although the original fibrous structure is not retained. The disappearance of fibrous structure probably can be ascribed to the melting of nanofibers during the high temperature treatment. The TEM images of carbons (Fig. S4) show that particularly carbon-b possesses more developed and open porous structures, while carbon-w appears denser than carbon-e and carbon-b. This indicates that ethanol and, particularly, 1-butanol treatments are beneficial to obtain porous carbons from BC. The porous structure properties of carbons were further studied by nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements (Fig. 2c and Table 1). Although the BET surface area of carbon-w results larger than other carbons, its pore structure mainly consists of micropores (Fig. 2d). Instead, the pore structure of carbon-b is dominated by macropores and mesopores, resulting in a larger external area. Therefore, the more open structure of BC-e and BC-b seems to be beneficial for forming a broader porous structure during pyrolysis. The XRD patterns of carbons are shown in Fig. 2e. The broad peak at around 23° present in the three cases can be attributed to the (002) plane of graphitic carbon [45]. The electrode architecture has a dramatic effect on the discharge capacity of Li–O2 batteries, as shown by several previous studies [38,46], which are useful to understand the behavior of our materials in this application. Therefore, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) was determined to gain textural insights from the electrochemical point of view of the porous carbons [47,48], in the same electrolyte used in Li–O2 battery tests. The values were obtained from capacitive currents in cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the different carbons coated on a carbon paper support (Fig. 3 a). The ECSA of bare carbon paper is very small (0.14 m2 g−1), which means that it has little contribution to the electrochemical interface. The ECSA of carbon-b (180 m2 g−1) is the largest among the carbons derived from BCs, as carbon-e provided 99 m2 g−1 and carbon-w 33 m2 g−1 (Fig. 3b and Table 1). Thus, the largest BET area of BC-w translates into the smallest electrochemically effective area, showing that the smallest micropores are not accessible for our electrolyte, similarly to what we previously demonstrated with ionic liquid electrolytes [46]. Instead, the larger pores of alcohol-treated carbons offer a better ion-accessible surface area, and show larger ECSA values. ECSA seems a more significant parameter to predict effectiveness as Li–O2 cathode than BET area. Fig. 3c displays cyclic voltammetry curves of our carbons in O2 atmosphere at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. There are one reduction peak and one oxidation peak, which can be respectively ascribed to the formation and the decomposition of Li2O2 [49]. Compared with carbon-w, alcohol-treated carbons display higher currents for both reduction and oxidation peaks. This shows that carbon-e and carbon-b provide better oxygen redox activities thanks to their more suitable pore structure. Galvanostatic discharge-charge profiles of Li–O2 batteries were operated at the current density of 0.1 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3d). The contribution of bare carbon fiber support is negligible (Fig. S6). Carbon-b and carbon-e provide discharge capacities of 5.58 and 1.36 mA h cm−2, while carbon-w only gives capacity similar to that of the support alone (0.14 mA h cm−2). Carbon-b also has the highest discharge voltage (∼2.75 V), which can be attributed to its larger ECSA. The larger area significantly decreases overpotentials in Li–O2 batteries and in effect correlation between specific area and discharge potential has been shown previously [38,50]. These capacities clearly show that not only the larger pore volume, but also the larger pore sizes favor the more abundant discharge of Li2O2 [51]. The poor capacity of carbon-w can be attributed to its small pore size. This is reflected by the low ECSA and is consistent with our previous observation that only pores larger than a certain size, in the order of 10 nm, significantly contribute to the cathode capacity [46,52]. Besides, small pores will be easily blocked, which hinders the diffusion of oxygen [53]. Instead, the other carbons show a much more suitable pore structure, in particular carbon-b which outperforms Super P, a carbon black with a very open structure that typically offers large capacity [38,52]. The capacity difference between carbon-b and Super P can be attributed to the different architecture of carbon-b which offers wider pores and larger surface area that allows for a better distribution of discharge products (Table 1 and Table S2). In addition, BC treated with 1-butanol for 24 h showed similar morphologies and discharge capacities (Fig. S7), confirming that 2 h soaking is sufficient for quantitative water removal. Compared to other reported carbons, carbon-b exhibits outstanding discharge capacity properties as it can be observed in Table S4. The rate capabilities of carbon-b and Super P cathodes were compared at the increased current density of 0.4 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3e). With the increment of the current density, the discharge capacity descended, discharge voltage decreased and charge voltage increased in all cases, but more severely for Super P. This better rate capability can be attributed to larger ECSA, demonstrating again the optimal texture of alcohol-treated carbons as Li–O2 cathodes. Carbon-b cathodes, displayed nearly 100% coulomb efficiency at 0.1 mA cm−2, and still 90% at 0.4 mA cm−2. However, due to the larger overpotentials, Super P exhibited poorer figures (92% at 0.1 mA cm−2, 43% at 0.4 mA cm−2). In line with this behavior, the cycling stability of carbon-b was far superior to that of Super P. In a test at 0.1 mA cm−2 with a capacity limitation of 0.5 mA h cm−2 (Fig. 3f and Fig. S8), the Super P electrode only sustained 4 cycles against more than 58 cycles for carbon-b. Table S3 depicts a comparison of the electrochemical performance for several reported cathodes. The outstanding number of cycles that carbon-b can withstand makes it an attractive material for Li–O2 batteries. To prove the specificity of the bacterial cellulose texture, cotton linters and agarose were also treated with water and 1-butanol, but the improvement from water to 1-butanol was not large (Fig. S9 and Fig. S10). This can be probably because the fibers of cotton linters and the bulk of agarose are much thicker and densified than the fiber structure of dried BCs. Other alcohols (such as methanol, 1-propanol, 1-hexanol and 1-octanol) and some non-alcohol solvents (acetone, ether and TEGDME) were also used to treat BCs with the same preparation method. All carbons derived from BCs treated with these solvents exhibit better capacities for Li–O2 batteries than carbon-w (Fig. S11 and Table S1) but lower than carbon-b. This shows that 1-butanol has optimal affinity for cellulose, probably due to its mixed hydrophobic-hydrophilic character [54,55]. However, in general it can be affirmed that the treatment of solvents with low surface tensions on BCs can promote excellent carbons for Li–O2 batteries."
7,Conclusions,"Porous carbons employed as cathodes in Li–O2 batteries have been successfully synthesized by using alcohols to treat BC. The much higher porosity compared to that of carbon originated from water-treated BC, seems to correspond to the more open structure of the intermediate dried cellulose, even if in all cases the fiber network is lost during carbonization. The structure obtained by treatment of BC with 1-butanol shows optimal properties as a cathode in a Li–O2 battery, with much higher capacity (5.58 mA h cm−2), lower overpotentials and longer cycling life than the water treated equivalent material. This performance is superior even to a reference commercial cathode material such as Super P, demonstrating a clear interest as a practical material for application in metal-air batteries, as well as metal-sulphur, supercapacitors and all systems that require efficient transport properties."
