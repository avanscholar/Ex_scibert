0,Introduction,"Hydrogenation is one of the most widely used chemical reactions that occurs between an environmental friendly reducing agent, molecular hydrogen and compounds bearing multiple bonds connecting two atoms often in presence of a catalyst [1–21]. This reaction is usually accomplished via two pathways. In one, hydrogen is just added across an unsaturated bond, which assists in connecting two atoms to be connected in the molecule structure; in another, addition of hydrogen causes dissociation of the structure of the molecule (termed destructive hydrogenation, or hydrogenolysis). The industrial usage of the hydrogenation procedure started in 1897, when Paul Sabatier, the French chemist, found out that a trace amount of nickel can catalyze the addition reaction of hydrogen to the carbon compounds; hydrogenation reactions of organic compounds (through addition and hydrogenolysis) are among the highly applied reactions due to their diverse industrial applications [22–28]. These protocols are utilized in procedures such as bleaching fabrics, purifying water, and storing energy (such as in batteries and gasoline) and also to produce a wide range of industrial goods in the food industry, like spreads and shortenings, from liquid oils. In the petroleum industry, several procedures are deployed to produce gasoline and petrochemical products following the destructive hydrogenation of hydrocarbons; they are crucial in coal processing, production of liquid fuels, preparation of pharmaceutical building blocks, food additives, agrochemicals, fragrances, flavours, and in biological processes such as metabolism and photosynthesis [22,29–31]. Reduction and, more specifically, hydrogenation reactions, are important pathways for the syntheses of organic compounds and chemical transformations, often utilizing transition metal catalysts, namely enhancing the rate of the reaction or assisting in the chemo- and regio-selective formation of numerous products [32–51]. Frequently, metals are used as catalysts in industry for the hydrogenation frequently in the form of nanoparticles or complexes. Different metallic catalysts, generated under cleaner and greener conditions commonly entail homogenous catalysis and cannot be easily segregated from the reaction mixture. That is the primary reason for the researchers to focus on the development and utilization of heterogeneous catalysts to circumvent the disadvantages of homogeneous counterparts in terms of their reusability, regenerability, easy management, and insolubility in solvents [52–61]. Other disadvantages attributed to homogeneous catalysts include their toxicity, higher-costs, requirements of nonviable ligands and catalyst's leakage, which are all unattractive traits thus greatly limiting their applications. So, it is important to discover more advanced catalysts. It is pertinent to point out that heterogenous hydrogenation has a number of shortcomings especially in the hydrogenation of alkenes: 1. Ordinary bonds between carbon atoms can cleave off resulting in the formation of hydrocarbons which are less branched or possess a shorter carbon chain; 2. The alkene can isomerize and form compounds of similar atomic composition, but of a different structure. These factors instigate the formation of secondary by products thus effecting the yield and purity of the final products. This does not usually ensue when homogenous catalysts such as Wilkinson’s catalyst, or the complex of rhodium [C6H5P]3RhCl-tris-(triphenylphosphane) rhodium chloride are used. On the other hand, heterogenous catalysts can perform selectively to reduce unsaturated bonds. For example, among several double bonds present in a compound, these catalysts selectively reduce those with fewer substituents (mono- or di-substitution) faster than those with more substitutents (tri- or tetra-substitution). Palladium (Pd)-based catalysts possess exceptional catalytic properties which extend their applications more than any other metal-based catalysts, for a variety of organic reactions [62–68]. Additionally, they are believed to be relatively less toxic with favorable environmental impact although recent studies report recommend that higher amounts of Pd can be toxic and may even cause cancer; PdCl2 is toxic, injurious if devoured, breathed in or taken up via the skin hurting the liver, kidney and bone marrow in creatures [69–71]. So, a suitable support is crucial to eliminate the probable nanoparticles (NPs) accumulation and the overstoichiometric deployment of Pd substances. Such strategies may also improve the life-time and reusability of the metal-based catalysts and render them suitable as safe and recyclable; several polymer-supported metal catalysts have been developed which can be recycled and reused for more than one run [72–92]. Generally, these catalysts can be prepared by the connection of a ligand to the polymer. The salient feature of metal catalysts in the form of nanoparticles comprise their small size, shape and also the higher surface area to volume ratios that make them distinctive in terms of quantum properties thus culminating in advanced catalytic performance and innovative applications compared to their bulk counterparts [93–99]. Polymer-supported Pd complexes are one of the most popular heterogeneous catalysts, which have been employed broadly under ligand- and copper-free conditions [100–111]. High stability and reusability, three-dimensional open pore networked structure, interconnected and uniform pores, high surface area and porosity are some of the main advantages of these metallic nanocomposite-based polymeric supports. The present review provides a detailed discussion on the polymer-supported Pd complexes during the last decades and their appliances in the hydrogenation reactions including the underlying prevalent challenges in this field. area plethora of different methods deployed to characterize these catalysts such as UV–vis spectroscopic data, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy are not in the scope of the present review. The focus is on the preparation of several catalytic systems documented in the literature from 1981 for the hydrogenation reactions using polymer-supported Pd complexes, illustrating the state-of-the-art in this field."
1,Proposed mechanism for Pd-catalyzed hydrogenation reactions,"Generally, no hydrogenation reactions can be accomplished between hydrogen and organic compounds under 480 °C without metal catalysts but the reduction in the high energy barrier can be conveneiently attained by deploying metal catalysts. Among the two classes, homogeneous or heterogeneous, metal-based catalysts tethered to supports, termed heterogeneous catalysts, are more common in industry. The selection of an appropriate support is crucial for these catalytic materials as their activity is affected by the support. Additionally, the choice of the catalyst greatly influences a hydrogenation reaction, as well as the catalyst concentration, solvent, substrate purity, pressure, and temperature. The most commonly used catalysts for the hydrogenation reactions are insoluble metals such as rhodium, iridium, ruthenium, nickel used as Raney nickel, platinum as PtO2, and palladium as Pd-C and their oxides which function at relatively lower temperatures and pressures [33]; at high temperatures and pressures hydrogenations, nickel supported on kieselguhr (loose or porous diatomite) and copper chromite are widely used. Hydrogenation reactions are not limited to the conversion of alkenes to alkanes as they include a wide range of reduction reactions executed to produce valuable compounds (Table 1 ). Hydrogenations are among the most important reaction classes used to manufacture massive amounts of useful chemicals. By adding hydrogen atoms to an organic compound, double or triple bond functionality is reduced, forming single bonds. These reactions enable the formation of CC simple bonds from alkenes and alkynes, CO bonds from ketones, and aldehyde or esters, and CN (amines) from imines or nitriles, among others. This exothermic reaction releases about 25 kcal/mol (105 kJ/mol) during the hydrogenation of vegetable oils and fatty acids. Generally, hydrogenation reactions comprise three components: substrate, hydrogen, and the catalyst, the later being as an essential component for facilitating the reaction at lower pressures and temperatures. Hydrogen gas is commercially accessible as the most popular source of hydrogen. However, hydrogenation reactions may also be accomplished using diimide (N2H2) [112,113], which can release or transfer a hydrogen molecule to an unsaturated unit and in the process gets oxidized to the very stable N2 (Scheme 1 ). There are numerous hydrogenating agents for the organic compounds namely dihydroanthracene, formic acid, isopropanol, ethanol, glycerol, ammonium formate, and H6[SiW12O40] [114–118]. Reddy and Swamy reported the synthesis of enamides via hydrogenation of ynamides under Pd catalysis in the company of ethanol as a hydrogenating agent [114]. Díaz Álvarez and Cadierno reported the metal-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of olefins, ketones, aldehydes, and nitroarenes with abundant glycerol as a hydrogen source [115]. Also, the hydrogenation of aromatic nitriles with ammonium formate as a hydrogen source and a Pd/C catalyst was studied in 2014, by Beller and co-workers [116]. Catalysts are able to bind the H2 molecule and facilitate and ease the hydrogen and the substrate reaction. For homogeneous catalysis, the hydrogen is attached to metal via oxidative addition to offer a dihydride complex. Then, the substrate connects to metal, and afterwards, first atomic hydrogen transfers from the metal to the substrate via migratory insertion. The next atomic hydrogen transfer occurs from the metal to the substrate with concurrent dissociation of the newly formed alkane via reductive elimination. For heterogenous catalysts, first, the unsaturated bond binds to the catalyst, followed by H2 dissociation into atomic hydrogen on the metal catalyst’s surface. Then first hydrogen atom links to the substrate in a reversible step; and final step is the irreversible addition of second atom. Hydrogenation reactions using polymeric Pd catalysts have been studied extensively in recent years [119–121]. Catalytic hydrogenation of different compounds has been performed and mechanisms for each individual reaction have been proposed. The general hydrogenation reaction mechanism for alkenes with assistance of Pd-based catalyst is depicted below (Fig. 1 ). The hydrogenation/reduction reactions occur with reducing agents. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4) is known as a useful but highly reactive hydrogen storage [122,123]. Since its discovery in 1947, several researchers have probed to find safer and more suitable substitutes [123]. Regrettably, even a slight improvement of stability of novel alternatives have resulted in a substantial lose of activity. Advanced in 1969, sodium bis(2-methoxy) aluminum hydride as commercially accessible reducing agent offers a noteworthy improvement compared to LiAlH4 but this reducing agent generates a byproduct, monomethoxyethanol, which is a known teratogen. Other replacements, sodium aminoborohydrides, were reported in 1961 [124] which could reduce many functional groups like LiAlH4; reduction of aldehydes, ketones and esters to alcohols, and also primary amides to amines could be accomplished in acceptable to high yields. Also, sodium dimethylaminoborohydride was used in some unusual reactions, wherein tertiary amine is supplied. In 1990, lithium aminoborohydride (LAB) [125] was discovered as a newer class of reducing agents which are selective, powerful and stable in the air; several LAB reagents are depicted in Fig. 2 which can be produced from any primary or secondary amines (Scheme 2 ), thus making it possible to control the steric and electronic nature of these reagents. Solid LAB components can be easily utilized in dry air just like sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and they uphold their chemical reactivity under N2 or dry air for at least 6 months. LAB will selectively reduce tertiary amides to their related amine or alcohol, unsaturated aldehydes and ketones to the related allylic alcohols, aromatic/aliphatic azides to the related primary amines, etc. [125]. As another group of reducing agents, dihaloindium hydrides (X2InH) can be mentioned [126] which are simply accessible from InX3 and Bu3SnH to help reduce a variety of functionalities such as aldehydes, ketones, enones, and imines; Scheme 3 shows the production reaction of indium hydride. Another example of a selective reducing agent is sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH3CN), first synthesis being reported in 1951 by Wittig [127] wherein the Li salt was prepared by reacting lithium borohydride with extra hydrogen cyanide under pressure. The direct reaction of borane with sodium cyanide may be more convenient to prepare NaBH3CN. Reaction of diborane with sodium cyanide in 1,2-dimethoxyethane gave a diborane adduct that was isolated as the etherate (Scheme 4 ). This reducing agent has been widely deployed for various applications including reduction of aldehydes and ketones. Carbon monoxide (CO)/H2O is another hydrogenating agent as an alternative to conventional reducing agents (hydrogen and metal hydrides) [128] but entails multiple stages to generate hydride reductants, and hence does not appear to be economically practical as H2 gas has low selectivity. These are several reasons for hydrogen-free systems to garner attention as CO can run selective reductive addition for substrates comprising different functional groups. Employing CO as both, a reductant and also the oxygen scavenger, offers the simplest and the most atom-affordable method where CO2 will be the only byproduct released thus necessitating no purification."
2,Polymer-supported Pd complexes in hydrogenation reactions,"Over the recent years, polymeric Pd complexes have been considered as efficient catalysts with high activity for significant applications [129] and assorted polymer-supported Pd complexes are summarized in this section."
3,Hydrogenation of soybean oil,"3.1 Hydrogenation of soybean oil Andersson and Larsson prepared palladium chloride attached to polystyrene by substituting the pyridine ligand in CI2Pd-(NCsHs)2 with the polymeric phosphine [130]. The major species developed in the reaction environment include the partially-substituted complex CI2Pd-(NCsHs)P-PS (PPS = polymeric benzyldiphenylphosphine), which were confirmed by infrared and other analytical studies performed on the prepared catalyst. The main stable species had structure II (Fig. 3 ) which is attributed to the mobility and split of the phosphine groups present in the matrix; while species I is formed only to a minor extent. As-synthesized polymer-bound Pd complex and two other bisphosphine complexes were used for the hydrogenation of soybean oil. The hydrogenation activity of the polymer anchored Pd-phosphine under ambient conditions was dependent on the availability of the mixed phosphine-pyridine complex; catalytic action being associated with the pyridine release from the catalyst."
4,"Hydrogenation of alkynes, alkenes and dienes","3.2 Hydrogenation of alkynes, alkenes and dienes Bowden et al. structured several platinum (Pt) supported on Nylon-66 fiber catalysts and used them for hydrogenation of 1-octyne in n-heptane and n-propanol under total 1 atm pressure at 70 °C [131]. The catalysts were developed through the backflow of ammonium chloroplatinite solutions with Nylon-66 fibers. The selectivity and activity of a few Pt-Nylon-66 catalysts were compared with Pd-Nylon-66 catalysts for 1-octyne hydrogenation, to ascertain if there is an indirect confirmation of complex formation in the Pt with a polyamide. There is a lot of difference between typical supported Pd and Pt catalysts which is reflected in their unusual selectivity and activity patterns including solvent sensitivity. Pd-Nylon-66 catalysts are present as several complex forms of Pd(II) in various concentrations, whereas Pt-Nylon-66 develops into principally Nylon-66-supported zero-valent Pt when the concentration is high, and it is only available as a complex at lower concentrations. The distribution of Pd and phosphorus (P) along a diameter of beads of supported Pd cluster complex catalysts was explored by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) by Sobczak and Wernisch [132]. Fig. 4 show the distribution of Pd and P along the diameter of two typical catalysts (A and B) bead. The models of active centers were proposed on the basis of the values of P:Pd ratios (Fig. 5 ), catalytic activities and selectivities in hydrogenation of 2-butyne (Table 2 ). Nayak et al. generated samples of Pd(II) supported on polymers by the oxidative addition reaction between chloromethylated crosslinked polystyrene and Pd(PPh3)4 [133]. The as-synthesized catalysts were utilized for hydrogenataion of alkynes and alkenes such as cyclohexene, styrene, norbomadiene, allyl alcohol and 2-butyne-1,4-diol under moderate conditions; largest and the smallest formation constant for complexation were obtained for the alkyne diol and allyl alcohol, respectively with the internal alkyne decreasing quickly compared to the terminal alkyne. The effects of PPh3, bases, temperature and enhancement of the benzene content was investigated on the reduction rate by H2; catalyst showed the best recycling efficiency and selectivity in reducing alkynes when mixed with alkenes. Ho and Wang prepared 8-aminoquinoline resin-supported Pd catalyst by refluxing a resin-bound Pd(II) complex in the solution of methanol-water [134]; wherein the Pd catalyst ensued in two valence modes (Scheme 5 ). The as-synthesized catalyst was deployed in the hydrogenation of hexene where the size of supported Pd particles affected the hexene hydrogenation rate. Additionally, it became apparent that decreasing the polarity of the solvents and thus increasing the Pd dispersion on the support, effectively reduced the Pd leakage. In another study, bimetallic complex catalyst containing Pd and lanthanoid was anchored on chloromethylated polystyrene beads derived from anthranilic acid and was employed for the hydrogenation of olefins (Table 3 ) [135]; preparative route for the catalyst is illustrated in Scheme 6 (P implies polystyrene). The effects of various parameters affecting the rate of octene hydrogenation namely hydrogen pressure and temperature, octene and catalyst concentration have been investigated. It is significant to note that the atomic number of the Ln series influences the promotional impact by the attached Ln ions; polymer-bound Pd-Ln catalyst displayed the best performance in hydrogenation when the f electron number was 17, 7 or 0. Mathew and Srinivasan reported that the Pd(OAc) and PdCl2 complexes of polyvinyl pyridine covered on silica gel (Scheme 7 ) served as efficient catalysts for the hydrogenation of olefins (Table 4 ) under moderate conditions [136]. The mechanistic and kinetic dimensions for the hydrogenation of substrates are examined, in terms of the selectivity of the catalyst, impact of additives on the hydrogenation rate and the catalysts reuse efficiency with turnover number (TON) presented in Table 4. Additionally, Pd complexes of poly-N-vinylimidazole and crosslinked polyacrylamide loaded on silica gel were synthesized by the same group and deployed as catalysts (Scheme 8 ) for hydrogenation of dienes, alkynes, and alkenes at room temperature and pressure (Table 5 ) [137]. The results affirmed that copolymers coated on silica could perform as ligands for attachment of Pd and the ensuing catalysts exhibited acceptable selectivity and recyclability in the reduction of alkynes and dienes to the related alkenes. John and Ram synthesized polymer-attached Pd(II) complex catalyst by attaching 1,2-diaminopropane as a ligand in a sequential manner to the chloromethylated styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer (XAD-2) [138]; FT-IR, EPR, SEM, and UV–vis spectroscopic analysis for the catalyst points out to the structure as shown in Fig. 6 . Additionally, some physicochemical features such as moisture content (0.38 wt%), surface area (326 m2 g−1), swelling, and the bulk density (0.36 gcm-3) were evaluated using the BET approach at the lower temperature using the nitrogen adsorption including other variables such as the quantity of solvent, substrate, the concentration of catalyst, and temperature. In another study, the Pd-containing polyacrylonitrile (PAN), polysulfone (PSF) and hollow fibers of cellulose acetate (CA) were formed by loading the soluble polymer attached complexes of palladium, polyvinylpyrrolidone-Pd, ethyl cellulose-Pd and melamine-formaldehyde resin-Pd [139]. They were stable and active for the hydrogenation of conjugated dienes under moderate conditions at 40 °C temperature and 0.1 MPa pressure. The selective hydrogenation of butadiene, cyclopentadiene and isoprene were effectively completed using the catalytic polyvinylpyrrolidone-Pd/PAN and polyvinylpyrrolidone-Pd/CA hollow-fiber reactors. Jo et al. [140], synthesized poly(vinylpyridine)-supported Pd catalysts in three forms which differ in the PdC12 solution primary concentration and employed them for hydrogenation of the cyclohexene including the influence of solvent on catalytic activity; preparation of these catalysts (I, II and III, not shown) was accomplished by varying nitrogen to Pd ratios (Table 6 ). Heterolytical activation of hydrogen helped the catalytic hydrogenation of cyclohexene. The solvent solubility and the hydrogenation rate showed a concave curve with a minimal importance when the solubility parameters of solvent and polymer were equal. Scheme 9 shows the proposed mechanism for the alkene hydrogenation. Palladium-hydride forms after activation of hydrogen molecule and then undergoes an insertion to generate a metal-alkyl. The alkane is liberated from metal-alkyl through H2 activation; when a proton is abstracted by the alkyl group. Subsequently, the catalyst is regenerated by reaction between residual H− and the metal. According to obtained results, cyclohexene hydrogenation rate using catalyst-I is higher than catalyst-II and III as depicted in Table 7 alongwith the effect of solvent on hydrogenation rates for cyclohexene. Dalal and Ram prepared Pd(II) complex loaded on the polymer as a catalyst via chloromethylation of the styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer (XAD-2), where ethylenediamine and salicylaldehyde were attached sequentially followed by treatment with an ethanolic palladium chloride solution [141]. According to the spectroscopic analyses, a plausible structure was suggested for the catalyst, named 2PS (Fig. 7 ), which catalyzes the hydrogenation of 1-hexene (Table 8 ). Jo et al. described the constitution of polymeric Pd complexes with dispersion of various active sites [142]. Initially, the phosphinated polymer support (listed in Table 9 ) was synthesized by reaction of chloromethyl groups of poly(chloromethylstyrene-codivinylbenzene) beads with lithium diphenylphosphine Then, palladium chloride was immobilized on the ensuing support to generate catalysts with various distributions of active sites, and the hydrogenation of olefins was examined in terms of distributed active sites. The results indicated that controlling the active site distribution is crucial to enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity of the polymer-supported catalysts (Table 10 ). The same research group prepared modified macroporous catalysts for hydrogenating the olefins (Table 11 ) [143] which were synthesized by covering the internal macroporous pore walls of poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene) with a polymer being slightly crosslinked that contains the functional groups; LiPPh2 was used for phosphinating the supports, and then PdCl2 was coordinated for generating the polymer-supported catalyst. The modified macroporous catalyst had some advantages and was especially helpful for usage in a strongly diffusion-limited system. Dalal and Ram have employed a new protocol for the functionalization of various crosslinked chloromethylated styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer with Schiff base via successive treatment with salicylaldehyde and ethylenediamine [144]. Remarkably, the surfaces of polymer modified with the ligand can be treated in simple ways with PdCl2 generating metal complex on the polymer surface (Fig. 8 ) for styrene hydrogenation and benzyl alcohol oxidation. However, 14 % cross-linked polymer-supported catalyst displayed more thermal-stability. Furthermore, kinetic studies have revealed that supported catalysts have higher catalytic activity compared to unbound metal complexes. The catalyst is recyclable more than three times with no noteworthy decay of catalytic value. Tembe and colleagues have structured new Pd(II)/Schiff-base complexes based on polymer support and used them for the hydrogenation of cis-cyclooctene to study its catalytic behavior [145]. These catalysts are formed by reaction of chloromethylated poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) (P(S-DVB)) copolymers (with 8 and 14 % crosslinking) and Schiff-base-bearing polymer by oxidizing chloromethyl group to an aldehydic group and base-assisted subsequent condensation. After this step, the Schiff-base-liganded polymers are treated with an alcoholic solution of PdCl2 to anchor the metal ion and afford the final catalyst (Scheme 10 ). The results of the hydrogenation reaction deploying this catalyst including other features such as variation of temperature, concentration of the catalyst and pressure of hydrogen on the reduction of olefin are also examined (Tables 12 and 13 ); better olefin conversions are achieved at higher temperatures and pressure of H2 wherethe measurements of hydrogen uptake determines the rate of the reaction. In 2009, Gayathri and co-workers successfully produced the polymer-supported Pd complex by complexation of PdCl2 with chloromethylated poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) modified Schiff base bearing ligand and then activation by sodium borohydride (Scheme 11 ) [146]. This recoverable Schiff base catalyst presented good efficacy for the hydrogenation of cyclohexene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, 1,5-cyclooctadiene (1,5-cod) and also norbornadiene (NBD) through the mechanism proposed in Scheme 12 ; catalyst was easily recycled and reprocessed for several runs with no noteworthy decay. In 2010, a novel azo complex of Pd(II) attached to macroporous beads of polystyrene (Scheme 13 ) was prepared by Islam and co-workers to facilitate the hydrogenation of styrene oxide, and to accomplish Heck cross-coupling and cyanation reactions [147]; catalyst represented advanced catalytic value compared to the other homogeneous analogs (Scheme 14 ) for the hydrogenation of styrene oxide to 2-phenylethanol (98 % conversion and 93 % selectivity to 2-phenylethanol) (Scheme 15 ), plausible mechanism being presented in Scheme 16 . The catalytic system shows good performance towards catalyzing all the three reactions in terms of easy preparation, robustness, phosphine-free conditions, high product yield, high stability towards temperature and suitability to be employed under a wide variety of catalytic treansformations with barely noticeable decay in activity after recycling for eight runs. Gayathri and colleagues have shown that benzimidazole and palladium chloride can be anchored on the surfaces of chloromethylated polystyrene divinylbenzene copolymer with 6.5 % cross-linking as support to stabilize the nanoparticles of Pd (Scheme 17 ); thus illustrating a straightforward way to introduce a recyclable catalyst for the reduction of olefins such as 1-octene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, diethyl fumarate, cinnalmaldehyde, diethyl maleate, ethyloleate, 1,5-cyclooctadiene, norbornadiene and cyclohexene [148]. A possible mechanism for hydrogenation of 1-hexene presented in Scheme 18 . The affects of different factors on reaction namely catalyst concentration, temperature, and substrate concentration through kinetics studies of hydrogenation of 1-hexene was examined; this catalytic system could be recycled, and its performance did not change after the number of sequential runs."
5,"Hydrogenation of carbonyl-, cyano-, nitro-compounds and Schiff bases","3.3 Hydrogenation of carbonyl-, cyano-, nitro-compounds and Schiff bases The catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl-, cyano-, and nitro-compounds and Schiff bases have significant industrial, health, and ecological impacts and have been considered as the most effective procedure for the preparation of amines and alcohols [149]. Saha and Bhattacharya have revealed that Pd(II) and platinum(II) can be attached on the surfaces of 2- and 4-vinylpyridine polymers with varying molecular weights (3000, 4000, 10000, 25000, 30000, 80000) as a support; this offers a facile pathway to offer recyclable catalysts for the dihydrogen reduction of benzaldehyde and various nitroarenes (Scheme 19 ) [150]. The catalytic activity of Pd(II) complexes is higher and more effective than platinum(II) analogues and higher molecular weight polymers cause reduction of activity. Nitroaromatics could be reduced selectively and completely without formation of any side products (Scheme 20 ). Cao et al. [151] prepared a non-organic polymer, polystannazane supported on silica (abbreviated as Sn-N), and its complex with Pt and Pd (abbreviated as Sn-N-Pt and Sn-N-Pd, respectively) (Scheme 21 ). These complexes were utilized for catalyzing the hydrogenation of the compounds that contained C = C double bound and carbonyl- and nitro-compounds (Table 14 ) and displayed higher catalytic performance under atmospheric hydrogen pressure at ambient temperature. Srinivasan et al. have prepared heterogeneous Pd complexes by attaching Pd(II) onto cross-linked polyvinylpyridine and poly(acrylamide-methacrylic acid) copolymer coated on silica gel (Scheme 22 ) [152]. This catalyst offers high activity towards hydrogenating azo and nitro groups (Scheme 23 ) with superb activity and high selectivity for the hydrogenation of azobenzene to hydrazobenzene. Besides, Pd catalyst is recoverable and can be used consecutively for more than five runs with no noteworthy deterioration of catalytic value. Macroporous polystyrene beads attached acetato-bridged dinuclear orthopalladated complexes were prepared via complexation of Schiff bases obtained from carbonyl compounds PhCOR (RH, Me and Ph) and aminopolystyrene with palladium(II) acetate [153]; mononuclear secondary amine complexes were produced through hydrogen activation at the temperature of 80 °C in DMF suspension, which caused a decrease in the coordinated azomethine group, and simultaneously, the bridged acetate was replaced by DMF and hydrogen. The activated species had excellent catalytic performance in dihydrogen reduction of aromatic carbonyl- and nitro, alkenes, alkynes and Schiff bases under ambient conditions of pressure temperature in aprotic solvents such as DMSO, DMF, THF and ethyl acetate; the highest activity was presented with RH in DMF. Yin et al. prepared chitosan-palladium complex supported on silica (SiO2-CS-Pd) for catalyzing the unsymmetrical hydrogenation of several ketones such as propiophenone, acetophenone, 4-methyl-2-pentanone and 3-methyl-2-butanone to the corresponding chiral alcohols, (R)-1-phenyl-1-propanol, (R)-1-phenyl ethanol, (R)-4-methyl-2-pentanol and (R)-3-methyl-2-butanol, respectively at ambient temperature under pressure of 1 atm H2 (Scheme 24 ) [154]; N:Pd molar ratio and a slight alteration in the ketone structure heavily influenced the optical yield (Table 15 ). Benvenuti and co-workers hydrogenated nitro-compounds and α,β-unsaturated aldehydes using bis(diphenylphosphino)methane polymer-bound Pd(II) complex [155]. The versatile and reusable heterogeneous catalyst was synthesized through a quantitative and simple Pd(OAc)2 coordination to a cross-linked styrene/divinylbenzene resin functionalized with bis(diphenylphosphino)methane ligands. Possible reaction routes to hydrogenate cinnamaldehyde are shown in Scheme 25 which proceed via the formation of hydrocinnamaldehyde (I) and cinnamyl alcohol (II), whilst the former is the main product (K1 >> K2) and the later is not detectable because it is very rapidly transformed (K3 >> K2) into 3-phenyl-1-propanol (III) not achievable significantly by hydrogenation of I (K4 ≈ 0). A complex of MgO-supported melamino-formaldehyde polymer palladium (MEFO-Pd) was synthesized by Cao and his group and utilized for hydrogenation of the aldehydes and nitroaromatics [156]. The furfuraldehyde and benzaldehyde hydrogenation produce the corresponding alcohols, while the amino groups were generated from the hydrogenation of nitro group. It was found that as-synthesized catalyst shows a high catalytic ability for the nitroaromatics hydrogenation (Table 16 ) andthe catalyst can be recycled after several consecutive runs. In a related study, Cao et al. disclosed the formation of catalyst via immobilization of Pd2+ on MgO-supported melamine-formaldehyde polymer (MEFO-Pd) (Scheme 26 ) [157]. The activity of heterogenized MEFO-Pd has been tested in the selective hydrogenation of nitroaromatics bearing a carbonyl functional group; simply nitro group in the p-nitroacetophenone and o-nitrobenzaldehyde gets hydrogenated selectively and the carbonyl group remains unchanged (Scheme 27 ). In addition, m-nitrobenzaldehyde does not produce related amino compound due to the very low rate of the hydrogenation reaction and the high propensity for self-condensation. The rate of the hydrogenation can be ordered as p-nitroacetophenone > p-nitrobenzaldehyde > o-nitrobenzaldehyde > m-nitrobenzaldehyde. Mastrorilli et al. reacted Pd(AAEMA)2 [HAAEMA = 2-(acetoacetoxy)ethyl methacrylate] with appropriate acrylates to produce cross-linked polymer [158] wherein acrylates plays the dual role of cross-linkers and co-monomers. The hydrogenation of various substrates (Table 17 ) viz. olefins, alkynes (Scheme 28 ), α,β-unsaturated aldehydes (Scheme 29 ), α,β-unsaturated ketones (Scheme 30 ), and nitro compounds (Scheme 31 ) could be accomplished by as-prepared catalyst (Pd pol)with the recycling of the catalyst without loss of metal. In 2003, Tembe and co-workers described the immobilization of ւ-valine on the surfaces of cross-linked poly(styrene-divinyl benzene) resin (6% and 8%) to stabilize palladium chloride (complex of amino acid Pd(II) supported on poly(S-DVB)) (Scheme 32 ); this led to a straightforward pathway to devise versatile and retrievable catalysts (Pd A: 8%poly(S-DVB)L-val Pd(II) complex; Pd B: 6%poly(S-DVB)L-val Pd(II) complex) for hydrogenating 1-octene, nitrobenzene, acetophenone and cyclohexene offering brilliant selectivity (Table 18 ) [159]. The influence of different parameters of the reaction and also extent of the surface, swelling behavior in various solvents, density, bulk, and some other physico-chemical charactristics of the catalyst on the reaction yield and selectivity, was investigated (Table 19 ). Ma et al. prepared titanium 2-[N-(2-hydroxy-1,2-diphenylethyl)]aminoethylphosphate (TiP) inorganic polymer and its supported Pd complex (TiP-Pd) by a simple method (Scheme 33 ) [160] The hydrogenation reaction was employed to measure the catalytic value of the TiP-Pd catalyst, which has been developed by acetophenone in homogeneous ethanol phase (Scheme 34 ); selectivities to 1-phenylethanol and ethylbenzene are presented in Table 20 . The TiP units have spherical morphology with an average radius of 5 μm. Addition of an equal volume of petroleum ether recovers up to 97 % of the TiP-Pd catalyst and the cycle can be repeated for 11 times offering an excellent efficacy with no leaching of Pd ion in the reaction mixture. The excellent catalytic ability of the polymer-linked complex of Pd(II) (Pd(C6H4CH = N–P)(PhCN)Cl] (P = poly N-vinylcarbazole)) with high stability for the hydrogenation reaction of diverse compounds such as nitromethane, nitroethane, 1-nitropropane (Scheme 35 ), 2-nitropropane, benzil, benzonitrile, acetonitrile, benzoin, benzophenone, acetophenone and acetone (Table 21 ) was described by Islam and co-workers in 2010 [161]; polymer-linked Pd(II) complex was prepared via reaction between poly(3,6-diamino N-vinylcarbazole) and benzaldehyde to secure polymer-linked Schiff base. The products were able to react with bis(benzonitrile)palladium(II)chloride [Pd(PhCN)2Cl2] to generate the polymer-linked complex (Scheme 36 ). Excellent yields were obtained in formation of anticipated pure products and the catalyst could be recycled more than 5 times with no noteworthy decay of catalytic value. The same group hydrogenated a wide variety of organic substrates at room temperature, using the same catalyst (Table 22 ) [162]; Scheme 37 depicts the mechanism inferred from kinetic studies and reactive intermediates using thermally stable, and recyclable catalyst presenting good conversion rates. In 2011, Islam group successfully synthesized reusable Pd immobilized on the surface of polymer-linked phenanthroline ligand (Scheme 38 ) [163] and used tit for the hydrogenation of substituted nitrobenzenes such as o-chloronitrobenzene, o-nitrotoluene, m-chloronitrobenzene, p-nitroanisole, p-bromonitrobenzene, p-nitrotoluene, m-dinitrobenzene, p-hydroxynitrobenzene, p-chloronitrobenzene, p-nitroacetophenone and p-nitrobenzoicacid and various other organic substrates such as styrene, hex-1-ene, pent-1-ene, phenylacetylene, maleic acid, cyclohexene, benzaldehyde at ordinary hydrogen gas pressure in DMF (Table 23 ). Gayathri and co-workers successfully synthesized an efficient and recyclable complex catalyst of palladium-imidazole supported on a polymer for the hydrogenation of various nitroarenes under mild conditions (Scheme 39 ) [164]; chloromethylated polystyrene divinylbenzene copolymer with 6.5 % cross-linking (PS-DVB) was used as a polymer. They succeeded in carrying out kinetic studies and proposing a rate equation and possible mechanism (Scheme 40 ) with demonstration of catalyst recovery for 6 additional runs. Recently, Strzelec and co-workers reported on Pd complex and nanoclusters catalysts supported on two innovative microporous functional resins and studied the hydrogenation reaction of cinnamaldehyde to validate their catalytic efficacy (Scheme 41 ) [165]; fabrication entails two terpolymers of styrene, divinylbenzene, and 1-vinylimidazole (S/DVB/VI) or N-vinylpyrrolidinone (S/DVB/NVP) which were initially produced via a radical polymerization process. Then, Pd complex PdCl2(PhCN)2 was coordinated to imidazole groups and pyrrolidinone within S/DVB/VI, S/DVB/NVP terpolymers. Immobilized Pd complex was reduced by reaction with sodium borohydride or during hydrogenation reaction (Scheme 42 ). This heterogeneous catalyst displayed no loss of catalytic value after being recovered and reused for five more runs although its selectivity was reduced. In 2011, Gayathri et al. explored the utility of polymer-supported palladium-2-methylimidazole complex in hydrogenating nitrobenzene and some of its derivatives (Scheme 43 ) [166]. In this process, chloromethylated polystyrene beads cross-linked with 6.5 % divinylbenzene (PS-DVB) was used as a polymer (Scheme 44 ). The nature and site of the substituent in the benzene ring is one of the most important factors in the reactivity of nitro group. Aniline is formed by both simultaneous hydrogenation and dechlorination when p-chloronitrobenzene (PCNB) was used as a substrate. In addition, sequential hydrogenation of nitro groups was observed when m-dinitrobenzene (MDNB) was employed as a substrate; recovery of this catalyst is demonstratedfor up to six runs. Recently, Islam and co-workers attached Pd(II) Schiff base onto p-amino polystyrene beads polymer to generate a novel complex catalyst (Scheme 45 ) [167]. The successful function of this system was shown via styrene oxide liquid-phase hydrogenation which selectively afforded 2-phenylethanol (Scheme 46 ) and other diverse substrates (o-chloronitrobenzene, o-nitrotoluene, m-chloronitrobenzene, m-nitroaniline, p-chloronitrobenzene, p-nitroaniline, p-nitrotoluene, m-dinitrobenzene, p-dinitrobenzene, o-dinitrobenzene, 1-nitronaphthalene, styrene, cyclohexene, hept-1-ene, hex-1-ene, pent-1-ene, nitrobenzene, fumaric acid, maleic acid, phenylacetylene, benzaldehyde and benzylidineaniline). They also investigated the liquid-phase hydrogenation reaction of various organics including the recyclability of this catalyst which was found to be appropriate for successive five runs. In 2013, Bączek et al. designed a facile process with magnetic core support that was encapsulated in a thiol-functionalized epoxy resin to offer a magnetically separable solid catalyst Pd catalyst [168]; Pd complex catalyst [PdCl2(PhCN)2] and the surface of the support can be anchored through ligand exchange reaction. The catalytic systems worked well in the Heck and hydrogenation (Scheme 47 ) reaction. The convenient and efficient magnetical recovery of this catalyst enabled it to be reused for eight cycles no significant loss of activity. Strzelec et al. have structured a new Pd complex via a simple pathway [169] wherein epoxy resin (DER) was cured with multifunctional polythiourethane (MPTU). The polythiourethane plays the hardener role and creates groups for linking on the polymer structure with no further resin functionalization. Additionally, they used supercritical CO2 (scCO2) for effective dispersal of the metallic complex on the polymer milieu. SEM micrographs established that the metallic complex distribution in the polymer matrix was better for DER/MPTU/Pd/scCO2; varying electronic structures of metal centers and different degrees of oxidation were responsible for high selectivity (Fig. 9 ) as revealed in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. In 2014, Ekbote et al. introduced an improved process for indirect reductive amination of aldehydes or ketones by a recyclable heterogeneous catalyst, triphenylphosphine-palladium acetate complex supported on polymer (PS-TPP-Pd(OAc)2) [170] which was prepared by reacting Pd(OAc)2 with polymer supported triphenylphosphine ligand (PS-TPP) in DMF 45−50 °C for 4 h; imine was generated by reacting aldehydes with amines, and then it was reduced by potassium formate being catalyzed by the ensuing complex (Scheme 48 ). A variety of aldehydes bearing both, the electron withdrawing and electron donating groups, exhibited extraordinary selectivity and reactivity under the optimized conditions; catalyst was utilized again for four other runs, where no notable loss of its efficacy. In 2016, Shilpa and Gayathri synthesized a complex of [2-(2ʹ-pyridyl)benzimidazole]palladium supported on polymer (PSDVB-PBIM-PdCl2) (Scheme 49 ) as an efficient catalyst for hydrogenating different Schiff bases, nitro compounds and oleﬁns at room temperature [171]. The catalyst exhibited acceptable performance in the various substrates reduction (Table 24 ) with demonstrated recyclability for up to 6 runs with no considerable decay in its shape and morphology; however, the complex with no support was not stable because the metal leached out into the solution even during the initial reaction. Sienkiewicz and co-workers explored the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde and Heck reactions using recyclable Pd catalysts [172] wherein the glass-polymer matrices were prepared by using glass as a core and mercaptan-modified epoxy resin (Fig. 10 ) as the shell (Fig. 11 ). The as-prepared matrices function as suitable support for heterogenization of homogeneous Pd precursor [PdCl2(PhCN)2] via ligand exchange process (Fig. 12 ). The most important benefit of using this catalyst was due to its capability to be mechanically separated from the reaction media. The results showed that the reaction characteristic, selectivity, and activity was affected by the polymer carrier’s morphology; nature and the quantity of mercaptan employed as modifier of the resin are two important factors for determining morphology aspects viz. pore size distribution and particular surface area. All the recyclable glass-polymer Pd catalysts have shown a strong catalytic constancy for consecutive reuse."
6,Hydrogenation of m‐cresol and o‐cresol,"3.4 Hydrogenation of m‐cresol and o‐cresol Huang et al. used methylcellulose-l-alanine-palladium complex supported on silica (SiO2‐MC-LA-Pd) as a chiral catalyst to unsymmetrically hydrogenate m‐cresol and o‐cresol to (R)‐3‐methylcyclohexanone and (S)‐2‐methylcyclohexanone with the optical yields of 68.5 and 91.5 %, respectively at 25 °C under 1 atm. pressure of H2 [173]. The catalyst was used four times, and the optical yields were obtained higher than 60 and 90 % for (R)‐3‐methylcyclohexanone and (S)‐2‐methylcyclohexanone, respectively. Scheme 50 presents the structure of as-synthesized catalyst, and the reaction mechanism of the unsymmetrical hydrogenation of m‐cresol and o‐cresol."
7,Hydrogenation of benzoic acid,"3.5 Hydrogenation of benzoic acid In 2002, Mao et al. expanded the application of MgO-supported poly-γ-aminopro-pylsiloxane-ruthenium-palladium-stannum trimetallic complex catalyst (MgO-NH2-Ru-Pd-Sn) (Fig. 13 ) for the hydrogenation of benzoic acid [174]; deploying hydrogen gas assistance and employing 1,4-dioxane as solvent at 210 °C delivered benzyl alcohol in 90 % yield (Scheme 51 ). In addition, the effect of reaction temperature, Ru/Pd/Sn mol ratio, the pressure of hydrogen gas and the reduction time for the reduction was examined (Table 25 )."
8,Hydrogenation of n-octylamine,"3.6 Hydrogenation of n-octylamine In 2004, Liu and Zhu described the preparation of the Pd complex of MgO-supported melamine-formaldehyde polymer catalyst (MEF/MgO) via a novel technique [175] and used it to catalyze the hydrogenation of n-octylamine with ᴅ-glucose to generate N-n-octyl-ᴅ-glucamine over couple of stages (Scheme 52 ) via the formation of the Schiff base and its hydrogenation under optimized conditions namely Et3N (1.0 mL); EtOH (60 mL); temperature (333 K); H2 pressure (1.5 MPa); the quantity of catalyst (Pd content 3.55 %, N/Pd molar ratio 12) (0.7 g); ᴅ-glucose (37.2 mmol); octylamine (31 mmol). The Pd complex of MEF/MgO catalyst showed excellent catalytic performance and high yields (57.6 %) under reaction conditions."
9,Hydrogenation of benzylideneaniline,"3.7 Hydrogenation of benzylideneaniline In 2010, Gayathri and colleagues offered a synthesis process to prepare polymer-supported palladium-imidazole complex (Scheme 53 ) [176]. This catalyst was deployed to hydrogenate benzylideneaniline (Bza) and some of its para substituted derivatives including p-ClBza, p-MeOBza, p-NO2Bza and p−OHBza (Scheme 54 ) with the proposed mechanism presented in Scheme 55; as-prepared catalyst is recyclable and can be reused in six other runs with no noticeable leaching of metal in the reaction mixture."
10,Summary and discussion,"The polymer-supported Pd catalysts deployed in different hydrogenation reactions are summarized in Table 26 . After survaying the related articles in literature, it became clear that there is no specific rule to theoretically predict the outcome of a catalytic reaction process. Generally, the comparison between catalysts depends on the conditions of the reaction, type of catalyst and its properties such as preparation methods, size, morphology, surface area, composition, type of ligand and has apparently no predictable rule."
11,Conclusion and future prospects,"The large number of published reports in recent decades demonstrates the true potential of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts in hydrogenation of different substrates. Homogenous catalysts possess many advantages including high reactivity and selectivity. But, their disadvantages, involving cumbersome separation from the reaction mixture, reuse of valuable noble metals, and also the industrial complications like deposition on the walls of the reactor and corrosion, have limited their applications and brought heterogeneous catalysts to the forefront due to favorable economic and environmental impact. Heterogeneous catalysis can be attained by heterogenizating homogeneous catalysts on solid supports. Metals supported on polymers possess unique properties including high surface area, small particle size, and thermal stability, which renders them attractive for a wide variety of catalytic applications. Herein, we have reviewed the application of these kinds of catalysts, encompassing Pd on the polymeric host, and their widespread usage in hydrogenation reactions. To advance the efficiency and recovery of catalysts, arresting palladium catalysts on solid supports can be counted as an ideal pathway. The strategy can prevent the agglomeration of Pd NPs and the overstoichiometric use of homogeneous Pd reagents. In this review, various polymers namely polystyrene, Nylon-66 fiber, polyvinyl pyridine, polyvinylpyrrolidone, ethyl cellulose, styrene-divinylbenzene, melamine-formaldehyde resin, poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene), aminopolystyrene, poly-γ-aminopro-pylsiloxane, poly(styrene-divinyl benzene) resin, chloromethylated poly(styrene-divinylbenzene), poly N-vinylcarbazole, epoxy resin cured with multifunctional polythiourethane (MPTU), phosphinated polymer, etc. are summarized which have been deployed to prepare polymer supported Pd complexes. Most of these catalysts readily convert nitriles, alkenes, alkynes, Schiff bases, oils, carbonyl and nitro compounds to the corresponding hydrogenated products in acceptable to excellent yields under various reaction conditions. These catalysts exhibit superb properties, including superb activity, stability, selectivity, and reusability in catalytic transformations which are determined by their characteristics such as size of the particles, surface area, catalysts structure, their morphology, preparation procedures. The exceptional features of the polymeric materials comprise enhanced chemical and thermal stability, low toxicity, low cost, simple handling, and reusability. Despite enticing developments in the usage of polymeric Pd catalysts in hydrogenation reactions, there are still some lingering concerns that need to be addressed in the future: • Development and utilization of natural polymers (viz. cellulose, gum, etc.) as support for the preparation of catalyst. • Utilization of plants extracts as biological sources to obtain Pd catalysts under greener and milder conditions which is atom economically beneficial and harmless to the environment and living creatures. • Development of green novel approaches to prepare polymer-supported Pd catalysts under mild conditions. • Development of polymer-supported Pd magnetic catalysts with reusability and excellent catalytic prowess. • Replacement of mild inexpensive hydrogenating agents. • Development of simple approaches and economical chemicals for the massive production of polymer-supported Pd catalysts."
