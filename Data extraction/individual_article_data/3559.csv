0,Introduction,"The upcoming global energy crisis and relevant environmental issues triggered by the combustion of limited fossil fuels propels humanity to search and exploit sustainable and environmental-friendly energy resources [1–4]. H2 has been reckoned as a kind of promising renewable energy succedaneum due to the virtues of high energy output and clean products after burning [5–8]. In recent years, room-temperature electrocatalysis water splitting as a promising technology for H2 generation has drawn tremendous attention. Generally, water electrolysis comprises two semi reactions, which are the anodic OER and the cathodic HER. Regrettably, the OER has long been the bottleneck on account of its tardy four proton-coupled electron-transfer reaction kinetics that requests extremely high redox potential, which directly handicaps the whole process of water decomposition to produce H2 [9–11]. Furthermore, the oxygen (O2) produced by anodic reaction is of limited value, the latent gas crossover may lead to the formation of explosive mixture H2/O2 and hence poses a safety hazard [12,13]. To mitigate aforementioned conundrums, the tactic for hybrid water electrolysis emerged. Taking advantage of the thermodynamics or kinetics more favorable organic substances (water-soluble) oxidation reactions supersedes the sluggish OER. These particular oxidation reactions can not only prominently decrease the operation voltage necessitated for the entire electrolysis system but also can obtain more ponderable products, achieving decoupled H2 generation. Hitherto, plenty of efforts have been devoted to hybrid water splitting, including electrolysis alcohol [14–19], organic biomass [20–23], etc. in alkaline aqueous media. Ethanol, a kind of sixpenny and easy synthesized organic compound, is extremely attractive. Conventional electrocatalysts for EOR are universally adopted precious metals, including Au, Pd or their alloys [24–27]. Nevertheless, the exorbitant price and scarceness immensely hinder their widespread practical applications. Hence, the design and exploitation of high-performance and economical bifunctional electrocatalysts for both cathodic HER and anodic EOR is imminent. During the past decade, NiFe-based oxides/hydroxides hold broad research passions as electrocatalysts owing to their low price, nontoxicity and earth-abundant resources [28–30]. Particularly, Ni and Fe sites have been confirmed synergistic for OER and HER with superior adsorption and desorption energies [31,32]. For instance, Guan and co-workers constructed the NiFe-Layered Double Hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) electrode via unipolar pulse electro-deposition approach, which exhibited a potential of 1.43 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm−2 toward OER [33]. Cai et al. fabricated vacancy-containing NiFe-LDH as symmetric electrodes for water splitting, the electrolyser only required 1.60 V to supply 10 mA cm−2 [34]. In another study, Xie’s group developed single-crystalline NiFe-LDH ultrathin nanomesh as a OER catalyst, which also demonstrated acceptable activity as well as stability [35]. Notwithstanding these advances, there is still a certain gap between them and the theoretical decomposition voltage of water due to the intrinsic inferior electrical conductivity of NiFe-based oxides/hydroxides which is adverse for electrons transmission through the catalytic phase and sufficient utilization of active sites. Recently, bimetallic phosphides (eg. NiCoP [36], NiMoP [37], Co3FePx [38]) have emerged as burgeoning non-precious metal catalysts for OER and HER. Compared with oxides/hydroxides (semiconducting or insulating), the phosphorus in phosphides possesses appropriate electronegativity, which can optimize the electronic structure of the materials, as a consequence, they possess high conductivity and superior catalytic activities [39–41]. Additionally, rational design of stable hierarchical nanosheet structure with nano/micropores has been deemed as another efficacious approach to enhance the catalytic performance of the catalysts. This kind of unique architecture could increase the active sites of the catalytic reaction, boost the mass transfer process and the escape of H2 bubbles generated by electrolysis, resulting in a positive impact on electrocatalytic behavior [42]. Inspired by the above discussion, herein, we report a hierarchical Ni-Fe-P nanosheet directly grown on NF, acting as a high active bifunctional electrocatalyst for both EOR and HER. This elaborated 3D self-supported architecture provides robust electrical linkage between the current collectors and active species. Meanwhile, the unique hierarchically nanosheets with nanopores architecture not only facilitates electrolyte infiltration, but also promotes the rapid release of H2 bubbles. Integrating the advantages of the structure and composition, the as-constructed self-supported Ni-Fe-P/NF electrode manifests superior catalytic properties for EOR with the requirement of only ~1.36 V vs. RHE to provide 10 mA cm−2 and excellent HER performance with an overpotential of ~156 mV vs. RHE in alkaline electrolyte contained 1.0 M ethanol. In addition, the hybrid ethanol–water electrolyser employed Ni-Fe-P/NF as two symmetric electrodes only necessitates a relatively low voltage of ~1.53 V to derive 10 mA cm−2, outperforming the sole water electrolysis (1.66 V). This work may broaden the horizon in designing and developing other high-efficiency organic molecule electrocatalysts and energy-saving H2 production applications."

2,Synthesis of Ni-Fe LDH on Ni foam,"2.1 Synthesis of Ni-Fe LDH on Ni foam The detailed information of the material and chemical reagents is stated in the Supporting Information. Typically, 0.66 mmol of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 1.34 mmol of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and 10 mmol of urea were dissolved in 35 mL of deionized water under stirring for half an hour and then decanted into a 50 mL reaction kettle. Whereafter, a piece of Ni foam (NF, 25 * 30 mm) was vertically immersed into the above mixture and reacted 120 °C for 12 h. After reaction, the NF was rinsed with water and ethanol thoroughly and then dried in vacuum at 60 °C. The obtained sample denoted as Ni-Fe LDH/NF."
3,Synthesis of Ni-Fe-P and NiFe2O4 on Ni foam,"2.2 Synthesis of Ni-Fe-P and NiFe2O4 on Ni foam In a typical phosphorization procedure, the as-obtained Ni-Fe LDH/NF was laid at the center of the tube furnace. Subsequently, 14 mmol of NaH2PO2·H2O was laid at the intake side of this tube. After douching with Ar for half an hour, the sample was calcined at 300 °C for 2 h. The obtained sample marked as Ni-Fe-P/NF. For comparison, NiFe2O4/NF was obtained through calcining Ni-Fe LDH/NF precursor at 350 °C for 2 h under the air atmosphere."

Then Pt-C/NF electrode was prepared via drop-casting the slurry onto the NF (1 cm * 1 cm) with a mass loading of 3.0 mg. The fabrication process of RuO2/NF is the same as that of Pt-C/NF electrode."
5,Electrochemical measurements,"2.4 Electrochemical measurements EOR, HER and OER properties of the as-fabricated samples were executed in a typical three-electrode configuration, where the as-fabricated samples (1 cm * 1 cm) was served as working electrode, Ag/AgCl and carbon rod as reference and counter electrodes, severally. The sole and hybrid water electrolysis were studied in a symmetrical two-electrode system via utilizing the as-fabricated samples. The more details of the characterization methods and electrochemical tests are stated in the Supporting Information."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Phase structures and morphologies of electrocatalysts,"3.1 Phase structures and morphologies of electrocatalysts The fabrication process of the 3D self-supported Ni-Fe-P/NF electrocatalyst is briefly demonstrated in Fig. 1 . Initially, the hydrolyzed Ni2+ and Fe3+ with the OH– and CO3 2– derived from CO(NH2)2 formed the Ni-Fe LDH nanosheets on the conductive substrate NF by a facile and scalable hydrothermal approach. Subsequently, the Ni-Fe LDH was converted to Ni-Fe-P via a mild low-temperature phosphorization treatment. The optical photographs presented in Fig. S1 reveal that the primal silver-white NF transformed into deep yellow with the intersecting Ni-Fe LDH nanosheets homogeneously decorated on the surface of NF substrate after hydrothermal reaction, which can be observed in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in Fig. S2a. After phosphorization reaction in Ar atmosphere and thermal annealing treatment under the air atmosphere, respectively, the color further changed to black and rufous, implying the formation of Ni-Fe-P/NF and NiFe2O4/NF (Fig. S2b). Fig. 2 a and b display the different-magnification SEM images of Ni-Fe-P/NF. After phosphorization treatment, the morphology is still well maintained. The thickness of a single nanosheet is approximately 30–35 nm. These intercrossing Ni-Fe-P nanosheets take shape into stable three-dimensional hierarchical structure. The detailed structure of Ni-Fe-P/NF was investigated through the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 2c, d). It can be observed that the Ni-Fe-P nanosheet contains numerous nanopores, which can effectively enlarge the specific surface area. The specific surface area was analyzed via N2 sorption isotherms, as depicts in Fig. S3. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area of the Ni-Fe-P catalyst is 106.8 m2 g−1, which surpasses that of Ni-Fe LDH (67.2 m2 g−1) and NiFe2O4 (86.6 m2 g−1). The pore size distribution in inset Fig. S3c indicates that the nanopores dominate in Ni-Fe-P catalyst. Such unique hierarchical nanosheet structure with numerous nanopores can not merely aggrandize the exposure of the surface active sites, but also boost the rapid escape of H2 bubbles, which is deemed to be beneficial for electrocatalysis [43,44]. The detailed structure of Ni-Fe-P/NF was investigated via the high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM), as exhibited in Fig. 2e, f and Fig. S4. The distinct lattice stripes with interplanar distance of 0.22 nm can be well assigned to the (111) plane of nickel–iron phosphide [45]. The STEM image and relevant energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) mapping images further prove that Ni, Fe and P elements are homogeneously allocated throughout the catalyst. The crystalline phase, surface composition and chemical states of the as-obtained catalysts were investigated through X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 3 a and Fig. S5 display XRD patterns of the Ni-Fe LDH/NF, Ni-Fe-P/NF and NiFe2O4/NF. For Ni-Fe LDH/NF, except for the three intense diffraction peaks at 44.5°, 51.8° and 76.4° that are attributed to the nickel foam substrate, the other peaks can be assigned to the standard LDH phase (JCPDS card No. 49-0188). As for Ni-Fe-P/NF, besides the peaks of nickel foam, the diffraction peaks at 40.8°, 47.5°, 54.2°, 55.2°, 66.4° and 74.9° correspond to the (111), (210), (300), (211), (310) and (400) planes of hexagonal Ni2P (JCPDS card No.03–0953), respectively. This result agrees well with previous reports on nickel–iron phosphide [45,46]. Fig. 3b–d exhibit the high-resolution XPS spectra of Ni 2p, Fe 2p and P 2p of the Ni-Fe LDH and Ni-Fe-P. The Ni 2p spectrum of Ni-Fe LDH (Fig. 3b) displays two main peaks at the binding energy of 856.2 and 873.7 eV that can be assigned to the Ni 2p 3/2 and Ni 2p 1/2 of the Ni2+ oxidation state [45]. The other two peaks at 862.3 and 879.3 eV are the satellite peaks (abbreviated as “Sat.”). After phosphating, the peaks at 856.2 and 873.7 eV shift to higher binding energy, indicating the transformation of electronic structure occurred during the phase conversion. The two peaks at 856.8 (Ni 2p 3/2) and 874.2 eV (Ni 2p 1/2) in the Ni 2p region of Ni-Fe-P are probably related to the Ni2+ in the phosphate due to the surface oxidation of phosphide [47,48]. Furthermore, another two peaks emerged at 853.6 and 870.6 eV are attributed to the Niδ+ in the Ni-P bond, indicating the existence of partially charged Ni species [49]. In the Fe 2p region of Ni-Fe LDH (Fig. 3c), the two major peaks at 711.5 (Fe 2p 3/2) and 723.9 eV (Fe 2p 1/2) accompanying with two satellite peaks at 716.1 and 729.1 eV are assigned to the characteristic binding energies of Fe3+ [49]. After phosphating, a new peak appears at the binding energy of 705.5 eV, which can be attributed to the Feδ+ (partially positive charge Fe species) in the Fe-P bond [47,50,51]. The P 2p spectrum of Ni-Fe-P (Fig. 3d) shows two obvious peaks, the first one at the binding energy of 130.9 eV is related to the Ni-P/Fe-P species. The other peak at 133.6 eV belongs to the P-O species, which may arise from surface exposure to air [52,53]."
8,Electrocatalytic performance toward EOR,"3.2 Electrocatalytic performance toward EOR To assess the electrocatalytic properties of the as-fabricated electrodes toward EOR and OER, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) tests were executed in a three-electrode setup in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with and without 1.0 M ethanol. The LSV curves recorded in Fig. 4 a are the comparison of the catalytic activities of different electrodes for EOR. One can observe that Ni-Fe-P/NF electrode exerts a much lower potential of 1.36 V vs. RHE to deliver 10 mA cm−2 comparing with those of bare NF (~1.44 V), RuO2/NF (~1.37 V), Ni-Fe LDH/NF (~1.39 V) and NiFe2O4/NF (~1.42 V) electrodes. This value also surpasses most of erstwhile reported transition metal based electrocatalysts developed for EOR, including Co3O4 nanosheets [14], perforated CoNi hydroxide [15], Co-S-P/CC [19] and other listed in Table S1. The EOR catalytic dynamics of the as-fabricated electrodes were assessed through the relevant Tafel plot (Fig. 4b). The Tafel slope of the Ni-Fe-P/NF is 17 mV dec–1, considerably smaller than the bare NF (117 mV dec–1), RuO2/NF (36 mV dec–1), Ni-Fe LDH/NF (60 mV dec–1) and NiFe2O4/NF (65 mV dec–1), demonstrating the rapid EOR kinetics. Such lower potential and smaller Tafel slope (Fig. 4c) indicate the prominent EOR electrocatalytic activities of the Ni-Fe-P/NF. For comparison, the OER activities of the as-fabricated catalysts were also explored via LSV measurements. Their LSV curves are presented in Fig. S6. When applied the potential of 1.5 V vs. RHE, the Ni-Fe-P/NF exhibits the highest current density, suggesting the impressive OER activities. The purpose of this work is to provide a brilliant electrocatalyst for energy-saving H2 production by replacing OER with EOR. As shown in Fig. 4a and Fig. S6, when exists of 1.0 M ethanol in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, the potential of the Ni-Fe-P/NF required to achieve 100 mA cm−2 for EOR (~1.398 V vs. RHE) shifted negatively by about 105 mV compared to the OER, manifesting the more beneficial thermodynamics and kinetics of the Ni-Fe-P/NF toward EOR than that of the OER. Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data was collected to evaluate the EOR dynamics of the as-fabricated electrodes. As presented in Fig. S7, all the Nyquist plots show two semi-circular arcs, which are analyzed via the equivalent circuit presented in inset plot. The first semi-circular arc at high-frequency area (R 1) corresponds to the surface adsorption or diffusion resistance and the others at low-frequency area (R ct) represents the charge-transfer resistance. The R ct value reflects the obstacle that needs to be conquered to boost the charge transfer during electrochemical reaction [54,55]. The smallest R ct value of 0.69 Ω was obtained on Ni-Fe-P/NF electrode, remarkably smaller than that of the bare NF (6.08 Ω), Ni-Fe LDH/NF (1.47 Ω) and NiFe2O4/NF (1.75 Ω), demonstrating faster charge-transfer dynamics of the Ni-Fe-P/NF, which is also consistent with the Tafel slope analysis. Since phosphorus possesses a conductivity similar to that of metals, hence, the smaller charge-transfer resistance should be attributed to the formation of nickel–iron phosphide. The electrochemical active surface areas (ECSAs) [56] of the as-fabricated electrodes were assessed to elucidate the enhanced catalytic EOR activities via measuring the double-layer capacitances (C dl) that could be estimated through the CV at various sweep rates in a non-Faraday reaction range (Fig. S7). The higher C dl of the Ni-Fe-P/NF (5.2 mF cm−2) compared with those of bare NF (1.1 mF cm−2), Ni-Fe LDH/NF (1.7 mF cm−2) and NiFe2O4/NF (2.8 mF cm−2) manifests that it possesses higher ECSA with more revelational active sites, which contributes significantly to the promoted EOR activity [57–60]. Moreover, the durability of an electrocatalyst is also a momentous criteria to evaluate its catalytic performance. Hence, EOR stablity of the Ni-Fe-P/NF was verified by a chronopotentiometry (CP) experiment running at a j = 20 mA cm−2, as exhibited in Fig. 4e. There was no distinct degradation after 30 h of continuous electrolysis. Furthermore, the LSV curve of the Ni-Fe-P/NF electrode displayed a negligible potential shift after 4000 CV cycles tests (Fig. S9a), revealing the commendable durability for EOR. SEM image (Fig. S10a) displayed inappreciable change in morphology after the durability test, further verifying its outstanding stability."
9,Electrocatalytic performance toward HER,"3.3 Electrocatalytic performance toward HER Having verified the extraordinary EOR activity of the Ni-Fe-P/NF, its catalytic activity for HER was also studied in alkaline medium with and without 1.0 M ethanol to estimate whether HER could be integrated with EOR in a single electrolyser. As displayed in the LSV curves in Fig. S11, only 4 mV disparity at j = 100 mA cm−2 can be observed in presence of 1.0 M ethanol, indicating the ethanol had a negligible effect on the HER property of the Ni-Fe-P/NF. Compared with other electrodes (Fig. 5 a), the Ni-Fe-P/NF electrode shows an overpotential of 156 mV (@10 mA cm−2) toward HER, which is a little higher than that of the Pt-C/NF (24 mV) but substantially precedes those of the bare NF (327 mV), Ni-Fe LDH/NF (243 mV) and NiFe2O4/NF (260 mV) electrodes. This result is also comparable to those state-of-the-art Ni, Fe-based HER electrocatalysts (Table S2). Based on the LSV curves in Fig. 5a, Tafel plots were acquired to clarify the HER dynamics mechanism. In general, the electrochemical HER mechanism in alkaline medium can be considered as a combination of the following basic steps: (i) Volmer reaction: H2O + e– → Hads + OH– (120 mV dec–1), corresponds to the electroreduction of water molecules. (ii) Heyrovsky reaction: Hads + H2O + e– → H2 + OH– (40 mV dec–1), signifies the electrochemical hydrogen desorption and/or (iii) Tafel reaction: 2Hads → H2 (30 mV dec–1), represents the chemical desorption. Herein, Hads stands for a hydrogen atom absorbed on an active site of the electrocatalyst [61,62]. The calculated Tafel slope of the Ni-Fe-P/NF electrode is 101 mV dec–1 (Fig. 5b), indicating that the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism predominated for H2 evolution [63]. The relatively lower overpotential and smaller Tafel slope (Fig. 5c) of the Ni-Fe-P/NF manifested its superior electrocatalytic activity and more beneficial dynamics during the HER. Moreover, EIS measurements were executed to further investigated the electrode reaction kinetics of the HER. Among these as-fabricated electrodes, Ni-Fe-P/NF exhibited the smallest R ct value in Nyquist plots (Fig. S12), indicating that it possesses the fastest charge-transfer kinetics. Meanwhile, the C dl values which are related to the number of accessible active sites, could be evaluated according to the ECSA measurement [64,65]. As depicted in Fig. S13 and Fig. 5d, the largest C dl value for the Ni-Fe-P/NF demonstrates that it possesses more exposed active sites, which could be attributed to its unique nanosheet architecture with numerous nanopores. Noteworthily, the long-duration chronopotentiometric measurement of the Ni-Fe-P/NF at j = −20 mA cm−2 was performed, as displayed in Fig. 5e. No noticeable degradation in potential was observed after 30 h cycling stability test. Moreover, the LSV curve of the Ni-Fe-P/NF electrode exhibited an ignorable potential loss after 4000 CV cycles tests (−0.6 ~ 0 V, 100 mV s−1) when compared with the initial electrode (Fig. S9b), suggesting its impressive stability toward HER. SEM image (Fig. S10b) shows that the morphology of the Ni-Fe-P/NF has not changed significantly after long-term CP test, which further confirms its superb structural stability during the HER process."
10,Evaluation of the catalytic hybrid/sole water electrolysis performance,"3.4 Evaluation of the catalytic hybrid/sole water electrolysis performance In consideration of the impressive electrocatalytic activity and stability of the Ni-Fe-P/NF for both EOR and HER and from an energy-saving point of view via hybrid ethanol–water electrolysis, the symmetric two-electrode electrolyser by employing Ni-Fe-P/NF was assembled. The schematic of homemade ethanol–water electrolyser is illustrated in Fig. 6 a. Fig. 6b presents the comparison LSV curves of the hybrid ethanol–water (1.0 M KOH electrolyte contains 1.0 M ethanol) and the sole water splitting systems. Notably, the cell voltage for former one only requires 1.53 V to provide j = 10 mA cm−2, 130 mV less than that of the sole water electrolysis, suggesting the less energy consumption when substituting OER with EOR in alkaline media. For comparison, the two-electrode devices based on NF//NF, Pt-C/NF//RuO2/NF, Ni-Fe LDH/NF//Ni-Fe LDH/NF, and NiFe2O4/NF//NiFe2O4/NF were also built for hybrid ethanol–water and sole water electrolysis. Their LSV curves are displayed in Fig. 6c and Fig. S14. Apart from noble metal-based Pt-C/NF//RuO2/NF, the Ni-Fe-P/NF//Ni-Fe-P/NF showed the largest current density under the same voltage in both the hybrid and sole water electrolysis system. This enhanced performance of the Ni-Fe-P electrocatalyst is mainly contributed to integrating the advantages of the composition and the structure. On the one hand, the Niδ+ and Feδ+ (Ni and Fe species with partial positive charge) in Ni-Fe-P catalyst possess excellent catalytic activity, which has been verified in other similar phosphides [45,51]. On the other hand, the formation of Ni-P or Fe-P bonds may make Ni-Fe-P have metallic behavior, which can promote the electron transfer process [45]. Meanwhile, the unique two-dimensional nanosheet structure with nanopores has a larger specific surface area, which can not only provide more active sites, but also facilitate the mass transfer process, resulting in enhanced catalytic performance of Ni-Fe-P for both EOR and HER (Fig. S15). Moreover, CP test (Fig. 6e) illustrates that the Ni-Fe-P/NF//Ni-Fe-P/NF hybrid ethanol–water electrolyser can guarantee a relatively low cell voltage of ~1.6 V (at j = 20 mA cm−2) and maintain 96.9% even after 30 h of continuous electrolysis, implying its admirable durability. Interestingly, there is no apparent bubbles can be observed at the anode side during hybrid ethanol–water electrolysis, which proves that the gas product is high-purity H2. Additionally, to identify the electrolysis product, the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurement was carried out. As illustrated in 1H NMR spectra (Fig. 6d), except for two characteristic peaks located at 3.43 and 0.96 ppm corresponding to the protons in ethanol, a new peak at chemical shift of 1.70 ppm was detected, which could be attributed to the protons of the methyl group in acetate [15,16]. Meanwhile, 13C NMR spectra were also captured, as shown in Fig. S16. Compared with the spectrum before electrolysis, the two obvious peaks at 181.0 and 23.5 ppm emerged after durability test, which could be well assigned to the characteristic peaks of acetate [15], indicating that ethanol successfully converted into more worthwhile acetic acid. These consequences testify that the Ni-Fe-P/NF has a superb electrocatalytic activity and selectivity for the simultaneous ethanol oxidation and energy-saving H2 production from hybrid water system."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, a cost-competitive and energy-saying electrolyser for H2 generation has been reported and constructed for simultaneous HER and EOR in a unitary cell utilizing a self-supported Ni-Fe-P/NF as bifunctional electrocatalyst. Integrating the advantages of the unique architecture (the large specific surface area nanosheets with numerous nanopores and the high conductivity of NF substrate) as well as the composition, the Ni-Fe-P/NF exhibits superb catalytic activity and stability for both EOR and HER in alkaline medium. Furthermore, a symmetrical two-electrode hybrid ethanol–water electrolyser only requires 1.53 V to achieve 10 mA cm−2, remarkably lower than that of the sole water electrolysis (1.66 V). Such low voltage also surpasses most of the erstwhile reported H2-producing electrolysers. More importantly, the Ni-Fe-P/NF shows impressive selectivity toward EOR, which not only acquires high-valued acetic acid at anode but also eliminates the risk of explosion caused by the mixture of H2/O2. Briefly, this coupling strategy of simultaneous EOR and HER by utilizing bifunctional electrocatalyst of the Ni-Fe-P/NF may broaden the horizon in designing and developing other high-efficiency organic molecule electrocatalysts and energy-saving H2 production applications in the future."
