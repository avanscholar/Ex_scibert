0,Introduction,"The selective oxidation of alcohols into the corresponding carbonyl compounds is an important research field. These most vital functional group transformations are used for the production of drugs, vitamins and fragrances [1–4]. Various inorganic oxidants such as Na2Cr2O7, NaClO, MnO2, and KMnO4 have been used for alcohols oxidation [5–11]. However, these oxidants are not only relatively expensive but they are also commonly hazardous or toxic, for the reason that these oxidants generate high amounts of heavy-metal waste. Moreover, the reactions are often performed in environmentally undesirable solvents, typically chlorinated hydrocarbons. From economic and environmental viewpoints, many studies have been conducted with the aim of developing clean systems with atom economy. Catalytic oxidation processes for the oxidation of alcohols into their corresponding carbonyl compounds on an industrial scale which employs safer, cheaper and more environmentally friendly oxidants remain a main challenge. Hydrogen peroxide has received much attention from the viewpoint of green chemistry, it is very attractive and a “green oxidant” for various oxidation reactions [12–16]. Additionally, it provides a high content of active oxygen species with water as the sole byproduct, safety in storage and operation, it is much cheaper and safer than inorganic oxidants, and it is also readily available [17,18]. Over the last two decades, polyoxometallates (POMs), anionic metal–oxygen clusters based on tungsten or molybdenum and in particular their transition metal substituted derivatives, have received attention as promising oxidation catalysts for the selective oxidation of organic substrates by a variety of oxygen sources [19–21]. For example, Mizuno and co-workers reported that [γ-SiW10O36]8− exhibits high catalytic activity for the epoxidation of various olefins and oxidation of organosilanes by hydrogen peroxide [13,16]. Recently, [WZnZn2(H2O)2(ZnW9O34)2]12− [22], [SiW11ZnH2O40]6− [23], [π-C5H5N(CH2)15CH3]3PMo12O40 [24], Na2WO4 [25,26], [γ-SiW10O36(PhPO)2]4− [27], [PW11O39]7− [28] and K8[BW11O39H] [29] have been used as effective catalysts for the oxidation of alcohols with hydrogen peroxide. Also, Misono et al. reported that the diiron-substituted [γ-SiW10{Fe(OH2)}2O38]6− has the highest efficiency for hydrogen peroxide utilization and conversion [30]. Very recently, the mono transition metal substituted Keggin phosphomolybdates PMo11M (M=Co, Mn, Ni) have been reported to be very efficient catalysts for the oxidation of alcohols with hydrogen peroxide [31]. The hydrolytic instability of the simple and lacunary Keggin and Wells–Dawson type POMs in the presence of aqueous hydrogen peroxide led to the use of various hydrolytically stable transition metal-substituted sandwich type POMs as catalysts for hydrogen peroxide activation. For example, various iron-containing POMs with different structures have been investigated and reported to be hydrolytically stable and have good activity for oxidation reaction with only moderate non-productive decomposition of hydrogen peroxide [30–33]. Although a number of methods have been developed, the search for new facile, cost-effective and environmentally benign procedures that avoid the use of toxic solvents and expensive oxidants still attracts substantial interest. Here, we want to report a comparison between the catalytic activity of Keggin and Wells–Dawson sandwich type POMs, [M4(PW9O34)2] m − and [M4(P2W15O56)2] n − (M=Mn2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+), (Fig. 1 ) as tetra-n-butylammonium (TBA) salts for the oxidation of benzylic alcohols."

3,Preparation of the catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of the catalysts Na8HPW9O34·19H2O, Na12P2W15O56·18H2O, [M4(PW9O34)2] m −, K6P2W18O62·14H2O and [M4(P2W15O56)2] n − (M=Mn2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+) salts were synthesized according to published procedures and their syntheses were confirmed by elemental analysis and infrared spectroscopy [34–41]. Na8HPWO34.24H2O was prepared from Na2WO4.2H2O, 85% H3PO4 and glacial acetic acid according to the literature [36]. Kl0[Mn4(H2O)2(PW9O34)2], K6[Fe4(H2O)2(PW9O34)2], K10[Co4(H2O)2(PW9O34)2] and K10[Zn4(H2O)2(PW9O34)2] were synthesized from Na8HPWO34.24H2O and the appropriate salts of Mn2+, Fe3+, Co2+ and Zn2+. K6Na4[Ni4(H2O)2(PW9O34)2] was also prepared as reported in the literature [40] from Na2WO4·2H2O, Na2HPO4, Ni(II) acetate and potassium acetate. Na16[Zn4(H2O)2(P2W15O56)2], Na16[Co4(H2O)2(P2W15O56)2], Na16[Ni4(H2O)2(P2W15O56)2], Na16[Mn4(H2O)2(P2W15O56)2] and Na12[Fe4(H2O)2(P2W15O56)2] were synthesized from K6P2W18O62·14H2O and the appropriate salts of Mn2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+ and Zn2+ by literature methods [36]. The TBA salts of these compounds were prepared by a metathesis reaction [40]. To 0.1mmol of the K x Na y [M4(PW9O34)2] and K x Na y [M4(P2W15O56)2] (M=Mn2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+ and Zn2+) salts in 30mL H2O, 10mmol of tetra-n-butylammonium bromide was added with stirring. CH2Cl2 (250mL) was added to this cloudy solution and the mixture was shaken in a separatory funnel. After standing for 30min, the mixture separated into a cloudy colorless upper layer and a clear yellow lower layer. The bottom organic layer was collected and concentrated to a thick oil with a rotary evaporator. A yellow solid was then precipitated from the concentrated organic layer by addition of diethyl ether (100mL). The resulting solid was collected on a medium frit and dried under vacuum for 24h (yield 80%). IR, CHNS and ICP analyses established that the POM structures did not change when the counter-ion was altered.

4,Typical procedure for catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol,"2.3 Typical procedure for catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol The catalytic reactions were performed in a 10mL round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a reflux condenser. The oxidation of benzyl alcohol was carried out as follows: catalyst (0.01mmol), CH3CN (3mL), substrate (1mmol) and H2O2 (30% aq, 1mL) were charged in the reaction flask. The reaction was carried out at 80°C and the progress of the reaction was detected by TLC accompanied by GC by an internal standard method. Assignments of the products were made by comparison with authentic samples."
5,Results and discussion,"The catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol, as a model compound, by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of tetra-n-butylammonium salts of [M4(PW9O34)2] m − and [M4(P2W15O56)2] n − (M=Mn2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+) as catalysts was carried out (Scheme 1 ). All of the synthesized POM salts used for catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol and gave the desired product in between 5 and 100% yield; the results are summarized in Table 1 . Under the reaction conditions, benzaldehyde was produced as the only oxidation product. (TBA)10[Zn4(PW9O34)2] showed 100% conversion after 45min (Table 1, entry 5), and for (TBA)16[Zn4(P2W15O56)2] the same conversion was obtained after 1h catalytic reaction (Table 1, entry 10). For both of these catalysts, the conversion curve indicated better activity for (TBA)10[Zn4(PW9O34)2] (Fig. 2 ). In the absence of the polyoxotungstate, the conversion of benzyl alcohol was very low (Table 1, entry 11). On comparing the performance of different POM catalysts after different reaction times, the highest conversion was obtained in the presence of [Zn4(PW9O34)2]10 −. The results with this POM catalyst were quite remarkable, as with 100% conversion of benzyl alcohol, complete selectivity for the benzaldehyde was obtained. With [Co4(PW9O34)2]10 − and [Co4(P2W15O56)2]16 − TBA salts, the benzyl alcohol completely disappeared after a 4h oxidation reaction. But after one hour the conversion was very low (Table 1, entries 2, 7). The yields for sandwich type POMs with a Wells–Dawson structure were 5–100% (Table 1, entries 5–10), and for sandwich type POMs with a Keggin structure they were 35–100% (Table 1, entries 1–5). From these results, the importance of transition metals in the central belt of the sandwich type POMs could be seen. Also, the catalytic effect of Keggin and Wells–Dawson type POMs in this catalytic oxidation reaction could be compared. As in previously reported works [42], among the various transition metals used in the central belt of sandwich type POMs, the catalytic effect of Zn is better. Transition metal substituted POMs may have a significant effect on the rate of dismutation of hydrogen peroxide and thus on the yield of aqueous biphasic oxidation of organic substrates [43]. The decomposition of H2O2 in the presence of various transition metal substituted POMs was examined and for Zn substituted POM less reactivity in the dismutation of hydrogen peroxide was obtained. This transition metal substituted POM also appeared to be stable in aqueous solution and in the presence of hydrogen peroxide [32]. The results also indicated higher catalytic activity of Keggin type POMs compared to Wells–Dawson type POMs. As stated in previous works, various transition metal-substituted Keggin type POMs are more stable than Wells–Dawson ones, especially in the presence of an oxidant for oxidation reactions [43]. For the results which were obtained with 1 to 9.8mmol of H2O2 and 0.1 to 0.005mmol of [Zn4(PW9O34)2]10 − and [Zn4(P2W15O56)2]16 − TBA salts, in most cases larger amounts of catalyst and/or oxidant gave an improvement in the conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde (Table 2 ). The best conversion for benzyl alcohol was obtained when 0.01mmol of catalyst and 9.8mmol of hydrogen peroxide were used. Using this procedure, the reaction of various benzylic alcohols (Scheme 1) was clean and all of the alcohols were converted into the corresponding aldehydes in excellent yields without over-oxidation to carboxylic acids (Table 3 ). On comparing benzyl alcohol with benzylic alcohols containing an electron-releasing substituent (Table 3, entries 7–10), it was found that the reaction times for the electron-rich alcohols are shorter. Benzylic alcohols with electron-withdrawing groups (Table 3, entries 2–6) required longer reaction times and gave lower yields. However both electron withdrawing and electron donating substituents, such as p-NO2, m-NO2, o-Cl, p-Cl, p-Br and p-OMe, on the benzene ring gave the desired products in 98–100% yields with (TBA)10[Zn4(PW9O34)2] and 87–98% yields with (TBA)16[Zn4(P2W15O56)2]. Thus, both catalysts showed excellent selectivity in the oxidation of benzylic alcohols, and aldehyde was the only product. The recyclability of the catalyst in the oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol was investigated. For three cycles, benzyl alcohol was completely converted to benzaldehyde without appreciable loss in catalytic activity. However, in the forth and fifth cycles the product yields decreased from 100% to 70% (Table 4 ). The decrease in catalytic activity may be due to the structure decomposing in the recycled catalyst. The FT-IR spectra for fresh pre-catalysts and recycled catalysts of TBA10[Zn4(PW9O34)2] and TBA16[Zn4(P2W15O56)2] for the first 3 runs are very similar and exhibit characteristic peaks (Figs. 3 and 4 ). The similarity in FT-IR spectra suggest that the structures of the recycled catalysts are preserved and they are stable during catalytic recycling. However, in comparison, the FT-IR spectra for the recycled catalysts after cycles 4 and 5 show some differences."
6,Conclusion,"Keggin and Wells–Dawson sandwich type POMs with different transition metal in the central belts proved to be active catalysts for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol with hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant and acetonitrile as the solvent at reflux. With this catalytic system, high to excellent yields of aldehydes were obtained. The Wells–Dawson type POMs were shown to be less active than the Keggin ones and the Zn substituted POMs depicted higher conversions for both types. In the presence of [Zn4(PW9O34)2]10 − and [Zn4(P2W15O56)2]16 − TBA salts, high to excellent conversions for different substituted benzylic alcohols, and 100% selectivity for aldehyde were obtained."
