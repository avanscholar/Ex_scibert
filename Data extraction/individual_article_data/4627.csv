0,Introduction,"Biomass gasification offers the potential for producing a fuel gas that can be used for power generation systems or synthesis gas applications. Especially, generation of hydrogen from biomass has become attractive since biomass is a renewable and carbon neutral resource. However, biomass usually contains water and a dry feedstock is required for conventional gasification. Since a drying process is an energy-intensive operation and the produced H 2 will be stored under high pressure, supercritical water gasification is a promising technology for gasifying biomass with high moisture content [1–17]. The chemical and physical properties of water vary considerably above critical conditions (650K and 22.1MPa) when compared to water at ambient conditions. Supercritical water (SCW) shows low-viscosity and high-diffusivity values similar to those of organic solvents results in increasing solubility of organic compounds. Also, SCW exhibits a relatively high heat capacity that led to efficient heat transfer. An additional advantage of using SCW as the solvent is that the material to be processed was in aqueous solution and the product can be easily separated and recovered from the reactor effluents [18,19]. It seems that such properties make improvement for the solubility of lignin (one of the main components of biomass) in water resulting in the transfer of reactants (lignin and water) over the catalyst more smoothly. Lignin is a biopolymer in which p-hydroxyphenylpropane units such as trans-p-coumaryl alcohol, conifenyl alcohol and sinapyl alcohol are connected with ether and carbon-carbon linkages [20]. While the lignin is a potentially large energy source, it is difficult to convert the lignin to syngas [21]. This may be due to the existence of stable p-hydroxyphenylpropane units. Thus, a catalyst is necessary for the gasification of lignin to gas. In the earlier studies, there are several researches on the gasification of real biomass or the components of biomass (cellulose, lignin, etc.) or model compound of biomass tar in the presence of catalysts. For example, Elliott et al. [1,2] conducted a catalytic gasification process of p-cresol at 20MPa and 623K to produce methane and CO 2 in the presence of nickel, ruthenium, and rhodium supported on α - Al 2 O 3 or ZrO 2 catalysts. Antal et al. [3,4] had reported that active carbon was a suitable catalyst for the gasification of glucose or cellulose in SCW at 873K and 34.5MPa. Minowa et al. [5,6] conducted cellulose decomposition in hot-compressed water at 623K with alkali or reduced nickel catalyst and nickel supported on MgO catalyst showed best performance under tested conditions. They concluded that the kind of support has a strong effect on the gas yield, and the catalytic activity depended on the overall catalyst size rather than the surface area. Kruse et al. [7,8] conducted hydrothermal gasification of biomass and organic wastes at 873K and 250bar by addition of KOH or K 2 CO 3 to form a H 2 -rich gas. They reported that all organic compounds (glycine, glucose, cellulose) were completely gasified to H 2 -rich gas containing CO 2 as the main carbon compound. Yoshida et al. [9–11] examined the gasification of cellulose, xylan, and lignin mixtures and real biomass in SCW at 623K and 25MPa with commercial Ni catalyst. Firstly, they reported that the lignin content significantly affects the amount and composition of product gas. Secondly, they found that the catalyst was being deactivated by tarry product from the reaction between cellulose and softwood lignin (lignin sulfonate); however, the gasification of mixtures with hardwood lignin (lignin organosolve) and grass lignin was much more easy. Thirdly, they performed the gasification of glucose–lignin mixture solution at 673K and 25.7MPa using a flow reactor system, which consists of a pyrolysis reactor, an oxidation reactor and a catalytic reactor. Then, they achieved high gasification efficiency based on carbon up to 96% with total residence time of about 1min, and the main gas products were H 2 and CO 2 . Cortright et al. [12] reported that hydrogen can be produced from sugars and alcohols at 500K in a single-reactor aqueous-phase reforming process using a platinum-based catalyst. They showed catalytic aqueous-phase reforming might be useful for the generation of hydrogen-rich gas from carbohydrates extracted from renewable biomass and biomass waste streams. Watanabe et al. [13,14] conducted the batch experiments for hydrogen production from biomass (cellulose and glucose) with ZrO 2 catalyst in SCW (673–713K and 30–35MPa). It was found that the yield of hydrogen with ZrO 2 was almost twice as high as that without catalyst. Calvo et al. [15] conducted the degradation of organic wastes (glucose) in sub- and SCW with the addition of NaOH under providing 25% stoichiometric oxygen, and they found that about 77% glucose was converted to acetic acid (17%), glycolic acid (22%) and formic acid (38%). Hao et al. [16] used a continuous tubular SCW gasification system, and they found that glucose at low concentration (0.1M) can be completely gasified in 923.15K, 25MPa, and 3.6min resident time and no char or tar was observed. Pinkwart et al. [17] conducted the experiments with diesel oil and showed the possibility of fuel conversion at low temperature with commercial steam reforming Ni catalysts. They concluded that the supercritical reforming offers the possibility of a new low-temperature hydrocarbon conversion process to hydrogen for fuel cell applications. Furthermore, the product gases of conventional biomass gasification contain tar, which is a complex mixture of aromatics, and the condensable compounds present in tar may cause problems in downstream equipment, making catalytic hot gas cleaning a necessary step in most gasification applications [22–33]. In this case, most of the researches have focused on the Ni catalysts [22,24–33] as an effective catalyst for catalytic hot gas cleaning. Thus, all Ni-based catalysts applied for the gasification of biomass in SCW and catalytic hot gas cleaning were applied because these Ni-based catalysts were commercially used in naphtha reforming reaction process. However, no researches have been reported about the effect of Ni particle size on the catalytic performance of Ni-based catalyst for the gasification of biomass in SCW. Thus, in the present study, several kinds of Ni/MgO catalysts were prepared and were characterized by BET, XRD, XPS, TPR, and CO chemical adsorption techniques, and the relationship between Ni particle size on the catalyst and catalytic performance for the gasification of lignin in SCW was investigated. To compare with Ni/MgO catalyst, Co/MgO catalyst was also tested for the gasification of lignin in SCW."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of the catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of the catalysts Tenwt% Ni/MgO catalysts were prepared by impregnating MgO (JRC-MGO-4 500A, 28– 38 m 2 g - 1 ) with aqueous solutions of Ni ( NO 3 ) 2 · 6 H 2 O (Kanto Co.), followed by drying at 383K overnight. The material was then calcined in air for 8h at a desired value between 773 and 1173K. The calcined catalysts are denoted as 10wt% Ni(O)/MgO (773–1173K), and reduced catalysts are denoted as 10wt% Ni/MgO (773–1173K). The temperature inside parentheses indicates the calcination temperature. Tenwt% Co/MgO catalyst was prepared by impregnating MgO (JRC-MGO-4 500A) with aqueous solutions of Co ( NO 3 ) 2 · 6 H 2 O (Kanto Co.), followed by drying at 383K overnight. The material was then calcined in air for 8h at 873K."
3,Catalytic tests,"2.2 Catalytic tests Catalytic tests were conducted in a stainless steel tube bomb reactor whose internal volume was 6 cm 3 . The reactors were made of stainless steel (length = 105mm, i.d. = 8.5mm, o.d. =12.7mm) and Swagelock unions. One end was fitted with a high-pressure valve for the analysis of gas products and another end was inserted with a thermocouple. The loaded amount of sample was 0.1g of lignin (lignin organosolve, Kanto Co.), 1.8g of water and 0.1g of catalyst (particle size 180 μ m ). After the samples were loaded, air in the reactor was purged with argon for several times and pressurized to about 1.5MPa (30–37MPa at 673K). The loaded reactor was put into the air circulating oven whose temperature was controlled at 673K for reaction temperature. It took about 40min to reach 673K, and the reaction time (2h) included this heat-up time. After a given reaction time, the reactor was taken out of the oven and rapidly quenched in a water bath. It took about 1min to cool down the reactor to room temperature. The gases in the reactor were collected into a syringe via a sampling valve and the volume was measured. The gas products were analyzed with GC-TCD (Shimadzu, GC-2014) with Shincarbon-ST column. After the gas was collected, the products in the reactor were recovered with distilled water. The products recovered were separated into water-soluble and water-insoluble fractions. The water-insoluble fractions were extracted with THF and separated into THF-soluble and insoluble (contained catalyst) fractions. The liquid fraction was analyzed with GC-MS (GC-17A-QP5050A, Shimadzu) for both qualitative and quantitative analysis. The gas product yield of carbon basis is defined as below. (1) Product yield [Cmol%] = Mols of carbon atom in product Mols of carbon atom in reactant × 100 ."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations XRD measurements of calcined and reduced catalysts were performed on a Rigaku powder diffractometer with Cu-K α radiation. The tube voltage was 40kV, and the current was 40mA. The XRD diffraction patterns were taken in the 2 θ range of 30– 80 ∘ at a scan speed of 2 ∘ min - 1 . XPS measurements of calcined and reduced catalysts were performed on a Physical Electronics ESCA 5600ci spectrometer with a monochromatic Al K α X-ray source at a power of 300W. The XPS spectra used in this study were survey spectra (pass energy of 187.85eV) of Ni/MgO and Co/MgO catalysts and the emission angle from the surface normal for the spectra used here was 45 ∘ . N 2 -adsorption isotherms of samples were measured using a SA3100 (Beckman Coulter Co.) apparatus to calculate the specific surface area by the BET method. H 2 -temperature programmed reduction measurements were performed on calcined samples under flowing 10% H 2 diluted with Ar to investigate the phases after calcination. A 40 mL min - 1 feed of 10% H 2 /Ar was used for reduction and the temperature was ramped at 10 K min - 1 to 1173K. The effluent gases from the reactor were made to flow directly into the TCD involved in the GC (SHIMADZU 8A), which gives the consumption of H 2 . The exposed metal surface area of the reduced catalyst was determined by CO pulse adsorption at room temperature, assuming a 1/1 stoichiometry. Calcined catalyst (0.5g) was loaded into reactor (i.d. 6mm) and its reduction was carried out as described above. After reduction, the reduced catalyst was cooled to room temperature with flowing He ( 40 mL min - 1 ) and CO was pulsed (1mLperpulse) over the catalyst until no further adsorption of CO was observed. The CO left after CO adsorption was determined quantitatively with a TCD. Ni metal particle size was calculated by using the following equation: (2) d ( nm ) = 101.1 D ( % ) , where d (nm) is metal particle size, D(%) the metal dispersion. The amount of coke on the catalysts and the THF-insoluble fraction was quantitatively determined by elemental analysis (EA1108, Fisons Instruments Inc.)."
5,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1 shows the Ni2p peaks of XPS measurements for the Ni(O)/MgO catalysts calcined at temperatures (873–1173K). The peak at 857eV was obviously observed over all catalysts and this peak was assigned to the Ni 2 O 3 phase. Although the peaks at 854 and 852eV were assigned to NiO phase and Ni metal, respectively, no distinct peaks were observed on these Ni catalysts. It was concluded from this observation that the Ni existed as a Ni 2 O 3 phase on the calcined catalyst surface. Fig. 2 shows the XRD measurements of the Ni/MgO catalysts calcined at various temperatures. It can be seen that no significant shift of peak position was observed and only peak intensity slightly increased with increase in calcination temperatures. The peaks at 37 ∘ , 43 ∘ , 62 . 4 ∘ , 74 . 9 ∘ , and 78 . 8 ∘ for 2 θ are identified as MgO and MgNiO 2 . These five peaks were also observed on the reduced Ni/MgO catalysts (not shown here), and the positions of peaks were slightly shifted to lower angle after reduction indicated that the reduction of Ni oxide phase occurred. Table 1 summarizes the results of characterization for calcined catalysts. The amount of Ni loaded was almost same (9wt%) over all Ni/MgO catalysts and the BET surface area were decreased with increase in calcination temperatures. Both XPS and XRD measurement results showed that the Ni 2 O 3 phase exists on the catalyst surface and NiO–MgO ( MgNiO 2 ) phase was formed as bulk structure in all calcined Ni/MgO catalysts. Fig. 3 shows the profiles of H 2 -TP reduction for 10wt% Ni(O)/MgO catalysts calcined at various temperatures and of 10wt% Co(O)/MgO calcined catalyst. In the previous research [34], the peaks at 615 and 780K were assigned to reduction of large crystalline Co 3 O 4 to CoO and to reduction from CoO to Co metal, respectively, and one shoulder peak at 960K was attributed to MgCo 2 O 4 (Fig. 3a). In the case of Ni catalysts (Fig. 3b–f), two reduction peaks at around 700 and 1150K were observed over all calcined Ni catalysts. According to Freni et al. [35], the peak at around 700K should be assigned to the reduction of “unreacted” NiO located on the MgO surface or to the reduction of some form of Ni 2 + ions having square-pyramidal coordination in the outermost layer of the MgO structure. And the peak at 1150K can be assigned to the Ni 2 + ions located deep in the MgO lattice. It can be seen that the reduction of Co catalyst (Fig. 3a) was easier than that of Ni catalyst (Fig. 3c). Table 2 summarizes the results of characterization for reduced catalysts. The exposed metal surface area was decreased with increase in calcination temperatures. This tendency was in good agreement with the results reported. Although the extent of reduction for Co/MgO (Fig. 3a) seems to be larger than that for Ni/MgO (Fig. 3c) in H 2 -TPR profiles, the exposed metal surface area of Co/MgO was smaller than that of Ni/MgO catalysts (Table 2). This result indicates that the sintering of Co metal particle during reduction step occurs much easier than that of Ni metal particle, and the particle size of Co metal (99nm) was larger than that of Ni metal (80nm). Fig. 4 shows the carbon yield of gas products over several Ni/MgO catalysts and Co/MgO catalyst. The main products containing carbon atoms are CH 4 , CO 2 and C 2 H 6 . Tenwt% Ni/MgO (873K) catalyst showed best catalytic performance for the gasification of lignin in SCW at 673K for 2h among the catalysts tested. Carbon yield decreased with increase in calcination temperatures indicating that the activity has a relationship with Ni metal surface area (Table 2) except 10wt% Ni/MgO (773K) catalyst. Because the particle size of Co metal was larger than that of Ni metal, Co/MgO catalyst showed lower activity than Ni/MgO catalyst [36–38]. Fig. 5 shows the amount of all gas products obtained over the catalysts tested. It can be seen that the extent of H 2 among the gas products was relatively high over the catalyst, which showed lower activity for the gasification of lignin in SCW (Fig. 4). For example, 25–40% of gas products was H 2 over all catalysts except 10wt% Ni/MgO (873K) catalyst (about 3.5%). Table 3 summarizes the results of elemental analysis for C atoms of remained solid after reaction. When remained solid are analyzed by elemental analysis, the amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst and THF-insoluble fraction was obtained. Additionally, when the remaining solid are oxidized by air using TG-DTA apparatus, it was found that two peaks for weight loss are observed, and one peak below 633K can be assigned to THF-insoluble fraction. Thus, the amount of all carbon species of remained solid, and the ratio of THF-insoluble fraction to carbon deposited on catalyst will be calculated and are shown in Table 3. It was found from Figs. 4, 5 and Table 3 that 10wt% Ni/MgO (873K) catalyst is a promising system for the gasification of lignin in SCW and there is an optimal Ni particle size for this reaction. However, the relationship between Ni particle size and the activity is still not clear. Thus, further research is necessary and is now in progress."
6,Conclusion,"The gasification of lignin with Ni/MgO catalysts in SCW was performed using a conventional stainless steel tube bomb reactor. The results of characterization for prepared Ni catalysts showed that Ni metal and NiO–MgO phase formed on reduced catalyst via the reduction of Ni 2 O 3 and NiO–MgO phases by H 2 . On the other hand, Co metal on reduced Co/MgO catalyst was formed via the reduction of Co 3 O 4 phase. It was found from the results of CO chemical adsorption technique that the Ni metal surface area was decreased with increase in calcination temperatures, and Co metal particle size seems to be larger than Ni metal particle size. The catalytic performance data showed that the carbon yield of gas products increased with increase in Ni metal surface area except 10wt% Ni/MgO (773K) catalyst indicating that there is an optimal Ni metal particle size for this reaction. It should be noted that 10wt% Ni/MgO (873K) catalyst showed the best performance (carbon yield 30%) under reaction conditions tested. It was concluded that Ni/MgO catalyst is a promising system for the gasification of lignin in SCW."
