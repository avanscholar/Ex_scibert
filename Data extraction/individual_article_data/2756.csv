0,Introduction,"Because of the energy shortage and global warming effects, renewable and clean energies have received great attention [1–4]. Among them, bio-energy has a potential to offer a significant portion of the projected renewable energy provisions of the future. For example, ethanol (EtOH) has been widely used, serving as a good additive for improving the gasoline octane value and burning efficiency [5–7]. Currently, ethanol is mainly produced by two major classes of processes: (1) biological processes via fermentation of sugars derived from corn, sugar cane or sorghum [8], and (2) chemical transformation via hydrogenation of carbon (C) and oxygen (O) contained materials, such as carbon monoxide (CO) and fructose [9]. In the hydrogenation of synthesis gas (syngas), molybdenum-based carbides (β-Mo2C) have been greatly tested, especially for those of alkali-modified β-Mo2C [10,11]. As the previous study described [12], molybdenum carbide mainly produced light alkanes, whereas its modification with potassium (K) was found to significantly enhance the selectivity to alcohols composed of linear alcohols of C1–C7 (C1–C7OH). The addition of K to β-Mo2C catalyst led a remarkable shift of the products from hydrocarbons (HCs) to alcohols, and further exhibited highly active and excellent promotion effect to enhance the selectivity to C2 +OH [13–15]. Vanadium (V) used as a promoter can be easily reduced into low valence state, which has high capacity of adsorbing and storing hydrogen. Hence vanadium possesses strong ability of hydrogenation. Employing vanadium-containing catalysts of a Rh–Sm–V/SiO2, Luo et al. reported that the selectivity of the formation of ethanol from syngas is much higher than those of the formation of acetic acid and acetaldehyde [16]. The forementioned investigators indicated that an addition of the second metal may drastically affect the catalytic properties of the first one. Moreover, they reported more about the potassium, while less about V or combined V and K co-promoted Mo-based catalysts. As to the authors’ knowledge, no study concerning V–K–Mo2C catalyst has been reported. Thus in this study, V–K-modified β-Mo2C catalysts with various compositions of K/Mo and V/Mo were prepared and examined for the performance of synthesis of alcohols and other HCs. The promotion effects of the addition of K and V on the β-Mo2C catalysts on the synthesis of EtOH were emphasized."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts Mo-based catalysts were prepared employing the wet impregnation method [17]. A cylindrical ZSM-5 zeolite molecular sieve (5Å, 1.6mm pellets, 4–12 mesh), supplied by Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), was used as the support. It possesses a mole ratio of SiO2/Al2O3 of 2/1 and BET surface area of 310m2/g. The ZSM-5 support was precalcined in air at 900°C to avoid the structural change during the following high-temperature calcination for the preparation of catalyst. About 50g dried ZSM-5 was impregnated with 100ml aqueous solution of ammonium heptamolybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O). The pH value of the solution was controlled at 2.0 by adding nitric acid so as to avoid the over loading of the molybdenum. After being dried at 105°C for 24h, the sample was calcined at 500°C for 6h. The catalyst at this stage was denoted as MoO3 x /ZSM-5, where x wt.% is the concentration of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O solution with x =5 or 10. Potassium-modified sample noted as K y –MoO3 x /ZSM-5 was prepared by impregnating the obtained dried MoO3 10/ZSM-5 sample of 50g with K2CO3 solutions of y wt.% with y =1, 3, 5 or 10. It followed by drying at 120°C for 12h and calcining in air at 300°C for 1h [11]. The resulting sample was further calcined in air at 800°C for 12h. The potassium contents in the samples, expressed as weight ratio of K/Mo, are 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 1. The procedures were similar to those for the preparation of Rh–Mo–K/Al2O3 employed by Li et al. [18]. Similarly, the introduction of the transition metal V as a promoter was made by impregnating the previously prepared catalysts (MoO3 x /ZSM-5 and K y –MoO3 x /ZSM-5) using z wt.% aqueous solutions of ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3) with z =0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 1wt.%. The V-impregnated sample was then dried at 120°C for 12h and calcined at 700°C for 4h referring to the preparation of VOw/MOw [19]. The above stepwised-made catalysts were named as V2O5 z –MoO3 x /ZSM-5 and V2O5 z –K y –MoO3 x /ZSM-5. The Mo-based carbide catalysts including Mo2C x /ZSM-5, K y –Mo2C x /ZSM-5, V z –Mo2C x /ZSM-5 and V z –K y –Mo2C x /ZSM-5 were further treated by the temperature-programmer-reaction (TPRe) method as described in literatures [14,15,20]. The oxide precursor was carburized using 20% CH4/H2 (v/v) at a total flow rate of 40cm3/min. Firstly, the temperature of sample was increased from room temperature (T Rm) to 300°C at a rate of 10°C/min, then from 300 to 700°C at a rate of 1°C/min, and finally maintained at 700°C for 2h. After carburizing reaction, the CH4/H2 flow was switched to hydrogen and the sample was cooled to T Rm. At the end, the sample was passivated by Argon (Ar) at a flow rate of 40cm3/min at T Rm for 2h."
3,Characterization of catalysts,"2.2 Characterization of catalysts X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the tested catalysts were obtained on a Rigaku TTRAX III powder diffractometer (Sendagaya, Shibuya-Ku, Tokyo, Japan) using 18kW rotating anode Cu target as the X-ray source. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were carried out using JEOL JSM-7600F field emission scanning electron microscope (Akishima, Tokyo, Japan). The metal contents of the catalysts including the promoting metals were measured by SCIEX ELAN 5000 inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) made by Perkin Elmer (Waltham, MA, USA). The specific surface area (S BET) was estimated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation using the data measured employing Perkin Elmer's Micromeritics ASAP2020 (Norcross, GA, USA). The pore radius distribution and the mesopore analysis were obtained from the adsorption branch of the isotherm using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. The bulk particle density (ρ P) and true density (ρ S) (He displacement method) of catalysts were measured using Perkin Elmer's Micromeritics AccuPyc II 1340 Pycnometer (Norcross, GA, USA)."
4,Hydrogenation of CO,"2.3 Hydrogenation of CO The experimental system of high-pressurized fixed packed bed (HPFPB) was set as shown in Fig. 1 . The syngas was provided from CO and H2 cylinders with the mole ratio adjusted by the mass flow control (MFC) device. The CO and H2 with purities of 0.9995 and 0.9995 were supplied by Ching-Fong Co., Taipei, Taiwan. A 3/8in. single-tube reactor with the packing materials of catalysts and spherical glass beads was vertically set and used in this study. For the pressure control, a regulator was installed for maintaining the system pressure and adjusting the output flow rate. For the additional water vapor on the hydrogenation of CO, 100% relative humidity feeding gas was made from importing syngas exposed through a water barrel after the MFC devices, which was before the reactor. The polar organic products such as alcohols and acids were collected by the de-ionized (DI) water (4°C) in a condenser. The syngas was simulated with H2/CO mole ratio of 2. The HPFPB system was operated under the conditions with mass flow rates of H2 and CO ( d m H 2 / d t and dm CO/dt) of 654.8 and 163.7mg/h, gas flow rate of syngas (Q G)=300ml/min, temperature (T)=548–623K, mass of catalyst (m S)=7.5g, gas hourly space velocity (GHSV)=2038/h, and pressure (P ST)=40atm (reading at 298K)."
5,Analyses of liquid and gaseous samples,"2.4 Analyses of liquid and gaseous samples The analysis of gaseous organic compounds was performed using the gas chromatography/flame ionization detector (GC/FID, 6890 GC, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with AB-5 column (30 m×0.53mm×5.00μm, Abel Industries, Pitt Meadows, BC, Canada). A purge-and-trap sample concentrator (Model 4560, OI Analytical, College Station, TX, USA) was used to purify and inject the liquid samples into GC/FID for analysis. The gaseous products of CO, CO2 and H2 were analyzed by a chromatography/thermal conductivity detector (GC/TCD, 8900 GC, China Chromatography Co., Taipei, Taiwan) with a packed column (60/80 Carbonxen – 1000, 15ft×1/8 in SS, Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Properties and characteristics of catalysts,"3.1 Properties and characteristics of catalysts The XRD patterns of the samples are shown in Fig. 2 . The polygonal structure was made using the JCPDS (No. 35-0787) library for β-Mo2C catalyst in accordance with the characteristic peaks (Fig. 2a) at 2θ =34.4°, 38.0°, 39.4°, 52.1°, 61.5°, 69.6° and 74.6° [21]. With the addition of potassium (K–Mo2C (Fig. 2b)), there exhibit six new diffraction peaks. Among these, the peaks at 2θ =49.5° and 66.7° are K–Mo–C entities analogous to the structure of K–Mo–S in the K–MoS2 catalysts [22]. The peaks noted with solid stars (★) are the unbounded K resulted from the K2CO3 (JCPDS No. 71-1466) during the preparation of catalysts. Moreover, for the V–K–Mo2C catalyst (Fig. 2d), the diffraction peaks corresponding to V in V–Mo2C (Fig. 2c) were detected with 2θ =20.3° and 41.7° (JCPDS No. 41-1426) [23]. The SEM micrograph of sample in Fig. 3a indicates that β-Mo2C shows the regular morphology of polygonal particles. However, with the modification using potassium, small clusters appear on the surface of β-Mo2C as shown in Fig. 3b and d. The clusters might be related to K2CO3 and/or K–Mo–C entities. For the modification with vanadium, there appear the flakes and bulk structures of vanadium as illustrated in Fig. 3c, which are the entities of V2O5 [24]. The BET surface areas (S BET) and surface compositions of β-Mo2C, K–Mo2C and V–K–Mo2C catalysts are listed in Table 1 . In Table 1, the superscripts x, y and z in Mo2C x , K y and V z denote the respective concentrations (in wt.%) of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (C Mo = x wt.%), K2CO3 (C K = y wt.%) and NH4VO3 (C V = z wt.%) solutions used for the preparation of catalysts. It can be seen that the BET surface areas of β-Mo2C prepared with C Mo =5 and 10wt.% are 49.3 and 30.1m2/g, respectively. With the addition of K and V, the S BET generally increases as the dosage weight ratio of K/Mo and V/Mo increases. However, over-dosage ratios of K/Mo of 0.96 and V/Mo of 0.099 result in the decrease of S BET. For the simultaneous dosage of K and V using the C K and C V of 5 and 0.5wt.%, which give maximal S BET for the single-dosage cases with sole K and V, respectively, the vanadium co-modified with K provides S BET higher than other cases. This may be due to the enhancement effect of dual dosage species on the dispersity during the preparation of catalysts. The bulk particle density ρ P, true density ρ S and porosity (ɛ P) of V0.5–K5–Mo2C10 are 0.89g/cm, 2.50g/cm and 0.644, respectively. The cylindrical particle size is about 2–5mm with average diameter of 1.6mm."
8,Temperature effect on catalytic performance of molybdenum carbide catalysts,"3.2 Temperature effect on catalytic performance of molybdenum carbide catalysts Table 2 illustrates the performances of hydrogenation of CO at various temperatures (from 548 to 623K) over Mo2C5 catalysts. It can be seen that the conversion of CO (X CO) increases monotonously with the increasing temperature. At 623K, the highest X CO and the production rate (PR) of hydrocarbons (HCs) are 22.35% and 36.03g/h, respectively. However, comparing the yields of alkanes (Y Alk) and alcohols (Y AOH) shows that Y Alk is greatly higher than Y AOH at higher temperatures. Thus, β-Mo2C is an alkanes favorite catalyst. The influences of temperature on the selectivities of HC products (S HC) and specific production rate (SPR) of HCs over Mo2C5 catalysts are shown in Fig. 4 . The selectivities of methanol (S MeOH) and ethanol (S EtOH) decrease while those of methane ( S CH 4 ) and C2 + alkanes ( S C 2 + Alk ) increase as the temperature increases. Note that C2 + alkanes denote C2–C5 alkanes in this study. For the comparison between SPRAlk and SPRAOH, it again clearly shows that higher temperatures are favorable for the formation of alkanes, especially for CH4. Further, the β-Mo2C catalysts (Mo2C10) prepared using 10wt.% (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O was tested at 573K as well. An increase of the content of molybdenum results in the increase of the X CO and production rate of HCs, reaching 21.54% and 37.86g/h, respectively. It also enhances the Y Alk and Y AOH."
9,Effect of K and V promoters on the catalytic performances,"3.3 Effect of K and V promoters on the catalytic performances The characteristics of production at 573K using K-modified Mo2C10 catalysts are presented in Table 3 . The X CO using catalysts with K are obviously higher than those without K. Within the ratios of K/Mo=0.093–0.52, an increase of K clearly improves the catalytic reactivity, raising X CO from 25.71 to 28.78%. The decrease of X CO at K/Mo=0.96 is due to the decrease of S BET caused by the over dosage of K. In addition, the alcohol SPR and production rate of HCs also generally increase with the use of K for modifying the Mo2C10, reaching 5.87g/h/g-catal and 58.08g/h, respectively, at K/Mo=0.52. As the presence of K in β-Mo2C can promote X CO, the Y AOH shows a notable increase, which in turn lows down the Y Alk. For instance, the K/Mo of 0.52 gives Y AOH/Y Alk =18.14/8.80=2.06. In a previous study concerning the K modified Mo-based catalysts [13], the results indicated that the additional of K improves the X CO, Y AOH, and SAOH. Besides, the promotion effects of K decorating for β-Mo2C catalyst were more remarkable than those for molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) [25]. Upon adding K2CO3 to β-Mo2C, the product distribution shifts remarkably from alkanes to alcohols as illustrated in Fig. 5 . The increase in alcohols selectivities at the expense of decreasing alkanes continues until the K/Mo ratio is over 0.52, where the selectivities of MeOH, EtOH and PrOH exhibit maximal values evidently. The enhancement effect of K for the K–Mo2C catalyst on the Y AOH is consistent with the results of Xiang et al. [13]. Table 4 illustrates the performances of hydrogenation of CO over V-modified β-Mo2C catalysts. The V z –Mo2C10 catalysts also show a high catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of CO with X CO =21.82–26.17% at V/Mo=0.011–0.099. The SPR of alcohol and production rate of HCs are about 2.89–3.69g/h/g-catal and 39.72–47.37g/h. The values of Y AOH are about 9.08–12.01%. The above results indicate that the values of X CO, SPRAOH, PRHCs and Y AOH of V z –Mo2C10 are higher than those of Mo2C10 while less than those of K y –Mo2C10. Fig. 6 shows the variations of S AOH and S Alk with V/Mo ratio. It indicates obvious enhancement of V-decorated β-Mo2C catalysts (V–Mo2C) on the production of EtOH with S EtOH =11.83 to 20.60%. This is because the addition of V promoter leads to the increase of activity for C2-oxygenates, resulting in the enhancement of the selectivity toward the formation of EtOH compared to other alcohols. The S EtOH generally increases with the content of V on the catalysts, reaching a maximum of 20.60% at V/Mo=0.049. The trend is consistent with the findings of Luo et al. [16] concerning the V-modified rhodium-based (Rh-based) catalysts and indicating that the additional of V improves the S EtOH. Hence, vanadium possesses strong selectivity of EtOH compared to those of MeOH, PrOH and BuOH."
10,"Combined effects of K, V and water vapor","3.4 Combined effects of K, V and water vapor Table 5 illustrates the characteristics of the hydrogenation of CO using V0.5–K5–Mo2C x catalysts with x =5 and 10. The X CO as well as SPRAOH increases with the increasing x value as expected, giving X CO =33.31 and 35.05% and SPRAOH =6.78 and 7.49g/h/g-catal at x =5 and 10, respectively. The X CO and SPRAOH of V0.5–K5–Mo2C10 of 35.05% and 7.49g/h/g-catal are higher than those of K5–Mo2C10 of 28.78% and 5.87g/h/g-catal and of V0.5–Mo2C10 of 26.17% and 3.69g/h/g-catal. Thus, the combination of K and V exhibits the synergistic enhancement effects on X CO as well as SPRAOH. Table 5 also illustrates the effects of the presence of water vapor on the hydrogenation of CO for the cases using V0.5–K5–Mo2C x *, where symbol * denotes the cases with the presence of water vapor. The X CO values are 34.53 and 35.74% at x =5 and 10 for the cases with water vapor, showing slightly higher than those without water vapor. Further, the results reveal the enhancement of alcohol SPR and Y AOH/Y Alk with values of 8.27g/h/g-catal and 26.79/6.92 (=3.87) for the case of V0.5–K5–Mo2C10* which are higher than 7.94g/h/g-catal and 25.41/7.65 (=3.32) of V0.5–K5–Mo2C10. This may be attributed to the oxygen and hydrogen contained in H2O. As for the characteristics of the selectivities of individual products, the results for the cases of V0.5–K5–Mo2C x show favorable formation of ethanol, for example, giving a high S EtOH of 39.88% using V0.5–K5–Mo2C10. The introduction of water vapor for the cases of V0.5–K5–Mo2C x * enhances the S PrOH and S BuOH of higher carbon-containing alcohols due to the oxygen and hydrogen presented in H2O. The S PrOH and S BuOH are lower than S EtOH because the formation of C3- and C4-alcohols is generally more difficult than that of C2-alcohol of EtOH. Regarding the different performances between the cases of V0.5–K5–Mo2C x and V0.5–K5–Mo2C x *, the addition of water in the system may induce the water-gas shift reaction (WGS) of CO with H2O converting CO to CO2 for further reactions. The H2O may be also catalyzed to induce reactive radicals, such as hydroxyl radical (OH) and hydrogen radical (H) [26–28]. The reactive radicals induced from water may thus enhance the Y AOH, S PrOH and S BuOH."
11,Effects of potassium and vanadium on chain propagation,"3.5 Effects of potassium and vanadium on chain propagation The distributions of individual alkanes and alcohols are depicted in Fig. 7 as Anderson–Schulz–Flory (ASF) plots. Quantitatively, the ASF distribution can be expressed as M n = α n−1(1− α) or ln M n = n ln α +ln[(1− α)/α], where M n is the mole fraction of the product with a carbon number of n and α is the chain-growth probability [29]. For β-Mo2C catalyst, both alkanes and alcohols have liner ASF distributions as shown in Fig. 7a. The chain-growth probabilities of α Alk and α AOH are 0.186 and 0.426, respectively. A high α enhances the easiness of chain growth from C n−1 to C n as indicated by the term of α n−1. However, the term of 1− α reflects the probability of anti-chain-growth. A lower 1− α (or higher α) tends to yield lower M n . The competition of these two factors thus determines the net chain growth. As modified by potassium, the distribution of alkanes as illustrated in Fig. 7b also obeys the linear ASF plot with α Alk =0.209. However, the alcohols exhibit a deviation in the case of methanol, indicating a different reaction mechanism for the methanol formation over K–Mo2C catalyst. It is worth noting that C2–C4 alcohols of C2 +OH still follow the liner distribution plot with the chain-growth probability α AOH of 0.305. For the distributions of alkanes and alcohols over V-modified catalyst, Fig. 7c shows that the distribution of alkanes still obeys the linear ASF plot, giving α Alk of 0.196. For that of alcohols, it again indicates a deviation for the case of methanol. Besides, the probability of alcohols α AOH for V-modified catalyst of 0.346 is close to 0.305 for the K-modified catalyst. Thus, both potassium and vanadium exert a positive function on the chain propagation to produce alcohols, especially C2 +OH. As shown in Fig. 7d, the product distributions over V–K–Mo2C catalyst indicate the same types of ASF plots of alkanes and alcohols as those over K– and V–Mo2C catalysts. The results reveal that the modified β-Mo2C catalysts with V and/or K provide resembling reaction mechanisms in alkanes formation as the sole β-Mo2C catalyst. The main difference of reaction mechanisms between V–K–Mo2C and β-Mo2C catalysts lies in the chain propagation from C1OH to C2 +OH. For V–K–Mo2C catalyst, the K–Mo–C on the surface is responsible for the formation of higher alcohols of C2 +OH (Fig. 7b), while the decorated K–Mo2C catalyst with V further enhances the product selectivity to EtOH (Fig. 7d) which then indirectly reduces the selectivities for the other alcohols. This thus causes the decrease of chain-growth probability of alcohol α AOH from 0.305 to 0.197."
12,Conclusions,"Various Mo2C-based catalysts containing potassium and vanadium were prepared and tested for the synthesis of alcohols and alkanes from the hydrogenation of CO. Main conclusions can be drawn as follows. 1. For the modification β-Mo2C by K and V, the conversion of CO (X CO) and yield of alcohol (Y AOH) were obviously improved. 2. The activity for alcohol synthesis over V–K–Mo2C catalyst is much higher than those over K–Mo2C and V–Mo2C catalysts. 3. The most favorable alcohol produced using V–K–Mo2C catalyst is ethanol. 4. The addition of water in the V–K–Mo2C system induces the water-gas shift reaction (WGS) and enhances the yield of alcohols and selectivities of C3 and C4 alcohols, while retain the S EtOH at significantly high level. 5. As shown by the Anderson–Schulz–Flory (ASF) plots, the distributions of products of alkanes and alcohols over β-Mo2C obey the linear relationships. Moreover, the distributions of alkanes over K–Mo2C, V–Mo2C and V–K–Mo2C catalysts also follow the linear trends, revealing that the modification of β-Mo2C by V or/and K does not change the reaction mechanism for alkanes production. 6. For the distributions of alcohols over modified β-Mo2C, the trends exhibit deviations from liner ASF plots for methanol, indicating the alternation of reaction mechanisms of alcohol formation due to the presence of catalytic metals of K and V."
