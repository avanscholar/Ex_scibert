0,Introduction,"Limited fossil fuel resources and global warming issues stimulate great research efforts in sustainable production of fuel and chemicals from renewable biomass in recent decades. Furfural from acidic hydrolysis of hemicellulose is the most promising biomass platform chemical that can be manufactured through large-scale industrial process [1]. Through catalytic hydrogenation, furfural can be converted to furfuryl alcohol (FA) and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA). Furfuryl alcohol is widely used to manufacture foundry resins, synthetic fiber, farm chemicals, adhesives and fine chemicals such as vitamin and lysine [2–5]. THFA is considered as a green solvent and used in agricultural applications, printing inks, and industrial and electronics cleaners [6]. Furfural molecule has several active functional groups. There are many possible conversion routes during catalytic hydrogenation, including partial hydrogenation to FA, total hydrogenation to THFA and various possible side reactions such as heat-driven oligomerization, hydrogenolysis of side-substituents to 2-methylfuran, decarbonylation to furan and rearrangement to levulinic acid, and furan ring opening [7]. The core issue of furfural hydrogenation is how to control its reaction route and hydrogenation degree through using highly selective catalyst. The performance of heterogeneous hydrogenation catalysts is directly related to active metals and supports [8]. Supported noble and non-noble metals have been reported for hydrogenation of FR. Conventional production of THFA is based on a two-step strategy: hydrogenation of furfural FA over Cu–Cr catalyst and further hydrogenation of FA to THFA over supported noble catalysts. Direct hydrogenation of furfural to THFA has been achieved over Ni–Pd/SiO2 [9], Ni/SiO2 [10] and Pd/MFI [11] catalysts. The catalysts for hydrogenation of furfural to FA are supported Ni, Co, Cu, Ru, Pd and their bimetallic catalysts [2,12,13]. Pt-based catalysts are rarely used for producing FA from furfural due to complex side reactions (hydrogenolysis of the CO bond, decarbonylation, total hydrogenation and furan ring opening, etc.) [14]. It has not been reported that the hydrogenation degree can be adjusted through synergistic effects of bimetallic catalytic system. It is of great significant to achieve both selective hydrogenation and total hydrogenation of furfural through a well-define bimetallic mechanism. Physicochemical properties of the catalyst's support markedly influence its performance for liquid-phase catalytic hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes and ketones [8]. TiO2–ZrO2 mixed oxides exhibit high surface area, profound surface acid-base properties, a high thermal stability, and strong mechanical strength [15]. TiO2–ZrO2 mixed oxides are used as catalysts and catalysts supports for various reactions [16]. TiO2–ZrO2 supported Pt species are the most selected catalysts for hydrogenation conversion such as naphthalene hydrogenation [17], selective hydrogenation of furfural [12], and selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde [18]. TiO2–ZrO2 mixed oxides are used as supports of bimetallic catalysts for selective furfural hydrogenation. In this work, Ni–Pd over TiO2–ZrO2 was selected as model catalytic system to investigated synergistic effects of bimetallic catalysts upon selectivity of liquid-phase furfural hydrogenation. Raney Ni and Pd/C were used as benchmarked catalysts. The bimetallic catalysts with various ratio of Ni to Pd were screened and the experimental results showed marked synergistic effects. The corresponding mechanism was revealed by XPS measurement. In further investigation, the selectivity of Pt-M/TiO2–ZrO2 bimetal catalysts (M=Re, Sn, In) for furfural hydrogenation was explored and a different trend of bimetallic synergistic effect was observed."
1,Experiment,
2,Materials and chemicals,"2.1 Materials and chemicals Titanium butoxide, Zirconium (IV) butoxide solution (80wt% in n-butanol), dodecyl amine (DDA), nickel nitrate hexahydrate, furural, ethanol, toluene, dioxane, and 2-propanol were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent. H2PtCl6, KReO4, PdCl2, Pd/C and Raney Ni were purchased from Strem. SnCl4·5H2O and In (SO3CF3)3 were obtained from Alfa Aesar. All the reagents were used as received except furfural, which was used after vacuum distillation."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation TiO2–ZrO2 mixed oxide support (1:1, mole ratio) was prepared by the sol–gel method reported by our group [19]. All catalysts were prepared by co-impregnation or impregnation of metal precursors onto TiO2–ZrO2 binary oxide support. The calculated amount of TiO2–ZrO2 was impregnated with a certain concentration aqueous solution of metal precursors (such as PdCl2(CH3CN)2, Ni (NO3)2·6H2O, H2PtCl6, KReO4 SnCl4·5H2O and In (SO3CF3)3) and kept in an oven at 383K overnight. Then these solids were calcined at 723K in air for 3h. These catalysts were activated under flowing diluted hydrogen (H2/Ar: 10%) at 673K for 3h before testing."
4,Catalytic activity measurements,"2.3 Catalytic activity measurements Catalytic hydrogenation of furfural was performed in a 100ml stainless autoclave equipped with a pressure gauge, a magnetic stirrer, and an electric temperature controller. The catalyst (200.0mg), the solvent (8.5ml) and furfural (1.5ml) were introduced into the reactor. The sealed autoclave was flushed with H2 three times, pressurized with H2 to 5.0MPa, and started to stir. After the designated temperature was reached, the reaction began. At the end of reaction, the autoclave was cooled to ambient temperature and slowly depressurized. The conversion and product composition were analyzed by GC and GC–MS. GC was performed on a GC-2014 (SHIMADZU) equipped with a high-temperature capillary column (MXT-1, 30m, 0.25mm ID) and a FID detector. GC–MS was performed on a GCT Premier/Waters instrument equipped with a capillary column (DB-5MS/J&W Scientific, 30m, 0.25mm ID)."
5,Catalyst characterization,"2.4 Catalyst characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns was measured on a Rigaku Rotaflex diffractometer equipped with a rotating anode and a Cu-Kα radiation source (40kV, 200 MA; λ =1.54056Å). XPS data were obtained with an ESCALab220i-XL electron spectrometer from VG Scientific using 300W Al-Kα radiations. The base pressure was approximately 3×10−9 mbar. The binding energies were referenced to the C1s line at 284.8eV from adventitious carbon. The Eclipse V2.1 data analysis software supplied by the VG ESCA-Lab200I-XL instrument manufacturer was used to manipulate the acquired spectra. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a JEOL 2010 TEM equipped with an attachment for local energy dispersion analysis (EDX). The accelerating voltage was 200kV, and the spot size was 1.0nm."
6,Results and discussions,
7,Hydrogenation of furfural over Ni–Pd bimetallic catalysts,"3.1 Hydrogenation of furfural over Ni–Pd bimetallic catalysts Scheme 1 shows reaction route map of liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural in alcohol solvents. There are two target molecules: partial hydrogenation product (FA) and total hydrogenation product (THFA). Cu–Cr mixed oxides are the classic catalysts for partial hydrogenation of furfural. However, leached toxic Cr species pose serious environmental issues. Nickel-based catalysts are considered as potential replacement. The main drawback of nickel hydrogenation catalyst is that active zero-valent nickel species are highly sensitive to oxygen. It is difficult to keep nickel catalysts in their primary activated states. Fresh commercial Raney Ni shows low catalytic activity and poor selectivity of FA (Entry 1 in Table 1 ). Nickel over TiO2–ZrO2 binary oxide has improved catalytic activity for partial hydrogenation of furfural and the yield of FA reaches 69.2% (Entry 2 in Table 1). The reaction over the supported Pd catalyst mainly produces total hydrogenation product. The yield of THFA is 62.2% for furfural hydrogenation over commercial Pd/C and the value increases to 78.6% for palladium over TiO2–ZrO2 binary oxide (Entry 3, 4 in Table 1). When nickel and palladium precursors are introduced onto TiO2–ZrO2 through co-impregnation, Ni–Pd/TiO2–ZrO2 bimetallic catalyst is obtained. The coexistence of nickel and palladium lead to marked synergistic effects and enhance the catalytic performance significantly (Entry 5–8 in Table 1). Ni–Pd bimetallic catalysts show higher hydrogenation activity than anyone of the two mono-metallic catalysts. The yield values of hydrogenation products are above 90% and the percentage of byproducts is very low. Though adjusting the mole ratio of nickel to palladium, the catalytic selectivity is finely tuned to only one type of hydrogenation product. Addition of small proportion of palladium directly transfers the catalytic performance of supported nickel from partial hydrogenation catalyst to total hydrogenation catalyst. The bimetallic catalyst with Ni–Pd mole ratio of 5:1 shows the best performance. The yield of THFA reaches 93.4% and the percentage of useless byproducts is only 3.9%. These findings have the practical significance that supported nickel species can be transformed into highly active hydrogenation catalysts through being doped with a small proportion of palladium and the resulting catalysts even show higher activity than the supported palladium catalysts with the same metal load. The increase of palladium load of Ni–Pd bimetallic catalyst leads to gradual decrease of THFA yield. Ni–Pd (5:1)/TiO2–ZrO2 is a highly active hydrogenation catalyst. After the reaction runs for 1.5h, 97.3% conversion of furfural is achieved and the hydrogenation products include FA (39.8%) and THFA (38.4%) (Fig. 1a). FA is further hydrogenated to THFA. Solvent effect also influences catalytic activity and selectivity of liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural [20,21]. Fig. 1b shows experimental results of furfural hydrogenation in various solvent. The reaction is carried out over Ni–Pd/TiO2–ZrO2 (Ni/Pd=5) at 403K and under 5MPa of H2. The selected solvents include ethanol, 2-propanol, 1,4-dioxane, and toluene. The selectivity of THFA shows the following sequence: ethanol>1,4-dioxane>2-propanol>toluene. This trend is roughly consistent with the order of solvent polarity: E N T ( ethanol , 0.654 ) > E N T ( 2-propanol , 0.546 ) > E N T > ( 1,4-dioxane , 0.164 ) > E N T ( toluene , 0.099 ) ( E N T solubility parameter of the solvent polarity) [22]. When alcohols are used as solvents for aldehyde hydrogenation, acetals are typical byproducts [23]. As comfirmed by GC–MS, 2-furaldehyde diisopropyl acetal and 2-furaldehyde diethyl acetal are detected after furfual is hydrogenated in 2-propanol and ethanol. TiO2–ZrO2 binary oxides have surface acidity by charge imbalance of Ti–O–Zr bonding [24,25]. TiO2–ZrO2 with equal proportion of Ti and Zr shows the highest surface acid strength [16]. Acetalization is correlated with surface acid of catalyst support. This side reaction has also been reported for liquid hydrogenation of furfural using Ir/Nb2O5 in alcohol [26]. The formation of hemiacetal byproducts in has been reported for Ir/TiO2-catalyzed furfural hydrogenation in ethanol [27]. TiO2–ZrO2 mixed oxides not only have the advantages of both TiO2 as active catalyst or support and ZrO2 as acid-base sites, but also exhibit novel catalytic properties imparted by the formation of active intermediate states. TiO2–ZrO2 mixed oxide (Ti/Zr, 1:1) is calcined at 823K and the crystalline ZrTiO4 is formed. The materials are mixtures of ZrTiO4 nanocrystals and amorphous mixed oxides. The size of ZrTiO4 nanocrystals is in the range from 5nm to 10nm, which are embedded in the mixed oxide matrix and give novel catalytic properties of TiO2–ZrO2 binary oxide (Fig. 2 ). The amorphous TiO2–ZrO2 mixed oxide (Ti/Zr, 1:1) has a high surface area of 243 m2/g and the average pore size is 1.66nm [19]. Fig. 3a shows TEM image of porous structures of Ni–Pd (5:1)/TiO2–ZrO2 bimetal catalyst. Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) was employed to confirm the existence of nickel and palladium species over the support. EDX spectrum of Ni–Pd/TiO2–ZrO2 (Fig. 3b) shows peaks of Ni, Pd, Ti, Zr, O and Cu. The signals of copper are from supporting grid for TEM sample preparation."
8,Tuning selectivity via synergistic effects of supporting Ni–Pd bimetallic catalysts,"3.2 Tuning selectivity via synergistic effects of supporting Ni–Pd bimetallic catalysts The results in Table 1 reveal marked synergistic effects between nickel and palladium for catalytic liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural. A highly active and selective catalyst can be developed through doping supported nickel with palladium of one fifth of nickel load. Ni–Pd synergistic effect has been found in catalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene over Ni–Pd bimetallic catalyst supported by Ti containing mesoporous silica. The optimal molar ratio of nickel to palladium is 1.5 [28]. EDX spectrum has demonstrated the coexistence of nickel and palladium ove TiO2–ZrO2. However, there is no detailed information about the chemical states of nickel species and palladium species. To reveal the mechanism of Ni–Pd bimetallic synergistic effect, XPS measurement is performed to exam the chemical states of supported nickel species and palladium species. Fig. 4a shows the XPS survey spectrum of Ni–Pd (5:1)/TiO2–ZrO2 bimetallic catalyst. Typical elements are detected. The metal load of palladium is relatively low and Pd 3d XPS peaks are overlapped with strong Zr 3p peaks. These make Pd 3d XPS peaks hardly suitable for interpreting Ni–Pd synergistic effect. Fitting of the XPS envelope of Zr 3p results in identification of Pd 3d peaks (Fig. 4b). However, the overlap with strong Zr 3p signals makes binding energy measurement not quite accurate. Ni 2p XPS peaks have complicated patterns, but more useful chemical information about the synergistic effect. XPS measurement and calculation are performed over four selected model samples: Ni/TiO2–ZrO2 (A, reduced by hydrogen flow and stored in argon), Ni/TiO2–ZrO2 (B, separated A after one-batch hydrogenation, dried and stored in pure hydrogen), Ni–Pd (5:1)/TiO2–ZrO2 (C, reduced by hydrogen flow and stored in argon), and Ni–Pd (5:1)/TiO2–ZrO2 (D, separated C after one-batch hydrogenation, dried and stored in pure hydrogen) (Fig. 5 ). Fitting of Ni 2p XPS envelope results in identification of two chemical states of nickel species and their satellite peaks. Ni 2p3/2 at binding energy of 851.4eV and Ni 2p1/2 (851.4+17.3eV) are attributed to zero-valent nickel species. Ni 2p3/2 standard value of bulk nickel is 852.6eV [29]. Nickel species supported over TiO2–ZrO2 show a little shift (1.2eV) in their Ni 2p3/2 binding energies (BE) from the standard value. This may be attributed to the strong interaction between nickel species and TiO2–ZrO2 support [30]. Ni 2p3/2 at binding energy of 854.9eV and Ni 2p1/2 (854.9+18.3eV) are indexed to electro-deficient nickel species (Ni2+) [31]. There are some broad bands following Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 that are caused by satellite peaks. After being activated by hydrogen at relatively high temperature, the proportion of active zero-valent nickel species is very low for Ni/TiO2–ZrO2 (A in Fig. 5). The proportion has small variation during catalytic hydrogenation process (B in Fig. 5). This results in its low catalytic activity for furfural hydrogenation. For Ni–Pd (5:1)/TiO2–ZrO2, the proportion of active zero-valent nickel species has a marked increase (approximately 20.2%) (C in Fig. 5). The addition of Pd increases the reducibility of supported nickel species and similar phenomenon has been observed for Ni–Pd/Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst [32]. It is noteworthy that the coexistence of nickel and palladium makes supported nickel species highly dynamic during hydrogenation process. The proportion of zero-valent nickel species sharply increases to 42.9% after one-run furfural hydrogenation testing of Ni–Pd (5:1)/TiO2–ZrO2 (D in Fig. 5). Active zero-valent nickel species are in situ formed during hydrogenation process. This directly leads to greatly improved catalytic performance. The presence of palladium is the crucial factor in situ forming zero-valent nickel species. A hydrogen-transfer mechanism is proposed to interpret Ni–Pd synergistic effect (Scheme 2 ). Supported nickel species and palladium species should achieve a well-doped dispersion state. Palladium nanoparticles are kept in small size and uniformly embedded with nickel species. Molecular hydrogen is adsorbed and activated by palladium species and adjacent nickel species are facilely reduced to active zero-valent sites. This conversion significantly increases the surface concentration of catalytic active sites for furfural hydrogenation. However, such positive synergistic effect of Ni–Pd might be spoilt by lose of the required doping dispersion state. As revealed by experimental results (Table 1), the addition of palladium metal load has a negative effect upon the catalytic performance. Further increase of palladium proportion from 20% to 50% makes the catalytic performance more like monometallic palladium catalyst."
9,"Catalytic selectivity of furfural hydrogenation over Pt-M bimetallic catalysts (M: Re, In, Sn)","3.3 Catalytic selectivity of furfural hydrogenation over Pt-M bimetallic catalysts (M: Re, In, Sn) Table 2 lists experimental results of furfural hydrogenation over TiO2–ZrO2 supported Pt-M bimetallic catalysts. The hydrogenation over Pt/TiO2–ZrO2 leads to 49.6% of furfural conversion and product mixtures of FA (5.6%), THFA (49.6%), and ring-opening products (44.8%). Ring-opening products, including ethyl levulinate ester and 5,5-diethoxylpentan-2-one, are produced through hydrogenation of furfural and the following alcoholysis of furfuryl alcohol. These products can be explained by the bifunctional catalyst Pt/TiO2–ZrO2: hydrogenation activity and acidity of support. Similar results have been observed by our group using the bifunctional catalyst Pt/ZrNbPO4 in the conversion of furfural [33]. The low selectivity has also been reported for furfural hydrogenation over Pt/C [2] and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts [12]. The main products of furfural hydrogenation over Re/TiO2–ZrO2 are FA (57.6%) and acetal of furfural (29.1%). Pt–Re bimetallic catalyst shows excellent catalytic activity and selectivity. Furfural is totally converted and the selectivity of partial hydrogenation product (FA) reaches 95.7%. In and Sn are introduced as the second metal and show positive effects upon catalytic activity. Pt–Sn bimetallic catalyst has high furfural conversion (98.3%), but the selectivity is relatively poor. Pt–In bimetallic catalyst can convert 73.3% of furfural and the selectivity of FA is 74.9%. Ni–Pd bimetallic catalyst is highly active for total hydrogenation of furfural and Pt–Re bimetallic catalyst especially converts furfural into partial hydrogenation product (FA). Chemical states of Pt–Re/TiO2–ZrO2 catalyst are measured by XPS (Fig. 6 ). Pt 4f7/2 XPS peak of Pt/TiO2–ZrO2 is at the binding energy of 70.77eV and the value measured over Pt–Re/TiO2–ZrO2 is 71.01eV (Fig. 6A and B). The tiny difference may be attributed to measurement error. Supported platinum species of Pt/TiO2–ZrO2 and Pt–Re/TiO2–ZrO2 are kept in zero-valent state. Re 4f7/2 peak is detected at the binding energy of 45.85eV, which is indexed to middle chemical states between Re6+ and Re7+. It has been reported that Re 4f7/2 of ReO3 is at the BE of 45.2eV [34] and Re 4f7/2 of Re2O7 is at the BE of 46.4eV [35]. This finding implies that Re2O7 or ReO3 may be in situ converted to catalytic active species for hydrogenation of furfural. Similar results have been observed by Pascoe and Broadbent that cinnamaldehyde and crotonaldehyde have been hydrogenated to cinnamyl alcohol and crotyl alcohol by Re2O7 catalysts [36,37]. The side-reaction of acetalization is correlated with surface acid of the catalyst support. This phenomenon has been reported over other catalysts in catalytic hydrogenation of furfural [38]. In this work, the synthesized TiO2–ZrO2 composite oxide was selected as catalyst support. Both TiO2 and ZrO2 have been used as reducible supports in chemoselective hydrogenation and known as strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) properties [8]. During activation of catalysts, TiO2 was reduced into the lower valence of titanium (Ti3+), and the reduced support transformed part of electrons to the active metal Pt particle. This interaction has been confirmed by the fact that Pt 4f7/2 of Pt/TiO2–ZrO2 is at the binding energy of 70.77eV, which is lower than that of Pt foil (71.4eV). Similar results have been reported by Peter Claus that gold is negatively charged in Au/TiO2 catalyst [39]. The presence of oxidized state of second metals such as rhenium oxide is helpful to activate the CO bond [40]. When metal oxide species are located on the Pt surface, the hydrogen species on Pt are transferred to adsorbed CO bond to achieve selective hydrogenation. Pt–Re catalyst exhibits he best performance with yield of furfuryl alcohol 95.7%."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, a strategy based on bimetallic synergistic effect was developed to tune the catalytic selectivity of liquid-phase furfural hydrogenation. TiO2–ZrO2 binary oxide was synthesized as the support for monometallic or bimetallic catalyst. Addition of small proportion of palladium directly transfers the catalytic performance of supported nickel from partial hydrogenation catalyst to total hydrogenation catalyst. The bimetallic catalyst with Ni–Pd mole ratio of 5:1 shows the best performance. The yield of THFA reaches 93.4% and the percentage of useless byproducts is only 3.9%. Ni–Pd synergistic effect was interpreted through the hydrogen-transfer mechanism, which significantly increases the surface concentration of catalytic active sites for furfural hydrogenation. Pt–Re bimetallic catalyst especially converts furfural into partial hydrogenation product (FA). Furfural is totally converted and the selectivity of partial hydrogenation product (FA) reaches 95.7%. This excellent performance is achieved through synergistic effect of supported rhenium oxide species and platinum species."
