0,Introduction,"With ever increasing concerns on shortages of fossil energy and emission of greenhouse gases, the quest for sustainable production of biofuels from renewable resources has been on the rise [1,2]. As one of the most promising biomass-derived platform molecules, furfural (FAL) could be obtained by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of agricultural waste resources such as corn cobs and converted widely to massive serviceable and high value-added chemical molecules [3–5]. In these respects, catalytic hydrogenation of FAL to furfuryl alcohol (FOL) is an industrially preferred pivotal process for biomass transformations, since FOL plays an important role in producing a variety of chemicals, such as resins, biofuels, rubbers and fine chemical products [6–10]. In conventional methods, these reactions require fossil-derived, pressurized hydrogen gas, which can bring about safety trouble [11,12]. Thus, there's a strong demand to develop a more environment-friendly method without the use of external hydrogen gas. Transfer hydrogenation is an alternative channel to traditional straight-forward hydrogenation because the organic hydrogen donors, such as the organic acids and alcohols, can prevent using high-handed autoclaves and are easy to handle [9–22]. Moreover, those donors can be obtained sustainably from biomass resources, which could be a greener alternative [23]. Formic acid (FA), a co-product formed during acidic hydrolysis of biomass [24], has been widely used as an energy source due to its good stability, high atomic efficiency and energy density [25]. As a hydrogen donor, it has been used in transformation of various compounds [26–29]. However, in most FA-involved transfer hydrogenation processes, noble metals (such as Pt, Pd, Ru) were employed as catalysts with the help of organic bases (such as triethylamine, NaOH) [30–33], which make them less suitable for industrial applications. In order to decrease the practice cost, non-noble metal catalysts have been developed, but they exhibit low stability in present of acidic FA [34]. So far, there are only a few reports on the hydrogenation of FAL to FOL with FA over non-noble metal catalysts (Scheme 1 ). Therefore, it is highly desirable but challenging to design earth-abundant, acid-tolerant but highly efficient catalysts for hydrogenation of FAL to FOL with FA under base-free conditions. Carbon, which possesses high stability, rich surface species and good electron transfer properties, has been involved in metal-catalyzed various organic transformations [35–37]. As for high-stability- required catalytic processes, metal NPs tend to leach or aggregate due to their weak interaction with support [38]. To address these issues and achieve better catalytic performance, one effective way was recently adopted by encapsulating these NPs into carbon layers [39–42]. This special structure not only can effectively protect the metallic core from the harsh environment but also accelerate the catalytic reaction due to the synergistic effect of carbon shells and metals [38,43,44]. Meanwhile, the catalytic performance could also be effectively tailored by adjusting the properties of carbon layers by composition (e.g., N-doping) and structure (e.g., thickness, defects) [45][43,44,46]. For example, Wang et al. synthesized a magnetic carbon-encapsulated nano Fe0/Fe3C catalyst and demonstrated their efficient catalytic activities for phenol removal [47]. Ding et al. obtained molybdenum carbide encapsulated in N-doped carbon for the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to p-aminophenol in sulfuric acid by using molybdenum chloride and urea as the precursors [43]. Despite these advances, the investigation into the application of non-noble metal encapsulated in carbon-based materials for transfer hydrogenation of FAL with FA has been rarely reported. Herein, mesoporous N-doped carbon encapsulated Co catalysts (Co-N-C-T) are prepared by using Co(phen)2(OAc)2 complex as the precursor and nano-MgO as template for high-temperature annealing in nitrogen atmosphere [48]. As for transfer hydrogenation of FAL with FA, the catalytic performance of Co-N-C could be easily tuned by adjusting pyrolysis temperature. The optimized Co-N-C-700 is highly efficient for achieving 100% FAL conversion and >99% FOL selectivity with only 3.5 equiv. FA at 150 °C for 6 h. Using FA as hydrogen source shows much superiority than that of molecular H2. Co-N-C-700 is highly stable in acidic FA due to the encapsulated Co underlying N-doped carbon. This catalyst is capable for scale-up transfer hydrogenation of FAL and versatile for other aldehydes. Finally, this work may advance the research of earth-abundant Co-based catalysts for transfer hydrogenation of biomass in industrial applications."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Co-N-C catalysts were prepared via pyrolysis of the mixture of Co(phen)x(OAc)2 and nano-MgO in nitrogen atmosphere [48]. Typically, Co(OAc)2·4H2O (0.6 mmol) and 1,10-phenanthroline monohydrate (1.8 mmol) were added into 50 mL ethanol to form a transparent solution. After that, nano-MgO (3.16 g) was added and the suspension was sonicated for 10 min. The mixture was stirred at 60 °C overnight. After ethanol was removed by rotary evaporation, the solid was dried, and heated to a given temperature in N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 2 °C/min and kept for 2 h. The calcinated solid was treated by HNO3 solution (100 mL, 1 mol/L) in order to remove MgO and soluble cobalt species. The resulting sample was thoroughly washed with DI water, dried and named as Co-N-C-T, where T refers to pyrolysis temperature. Replacing cobalt acetate with nickel acetate, ferric acetate or copper acetate gave rise to Ni-N-C-T, Fe-N-C-T or Cu-N-C-T, respectively. Co/AC was prepared by impregnation method, followed by N2-treatment at 300 °C for 3 h and H2-treatment at 500 °C for 2 h."
3,Catalytic reactions,"2.2 Catalytic reactions The reactions were carried out in an autoclave (8 mL) purchased from Zhengxin, China. In a typical run, 0.73 mmol FAL, 25 mg catalyst, a certain amount of FA and 3.5 mL 1,4-dioxane were added into the autoclave. The sealed autoclave was purged, pressurized with N2 to 0.5 MPa and heated to 150 °C. After the completion of reaction, the autoclave was quickly soaked within cold water. The liquid was diluted with methanol and analyzed by GC (Agilent 7890A) with a 30 m capillary column (HP-5) using a flame ionization detector (FID). All the products were confirmed by GC–MS (Agilent 5977A MSD). A quantitative analysis was performed using calibration curves for every compound in the mixture. All data were calculated by the average of three replicate experiments. After the reaction, the catalyst was successively washed by methanol for 3 times and then dried at 80 °C for 12 h. The recovered catalyst was submitted to the next batch of reaction."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Structural characterizations,"3.1 Structural characterizations In order to study the crystal structure of Co-N-C-T catalysts, XRD analysis (Fig. 1a) was carried out. All samples show a diffraction peak at 25.6°, which could be attributed to C(002) of amorphous carbon [49]. With increasing the pyrolysis temperature, C(002) diffraction peak strengthens and becomes sharp, indicating the increased graphitization of C skeleton [34]. Two diffraction peaks located at 44.2° and 51.4° are also observed, corresponding to (111), (002) planes of metallic Co [39]. Co diffraction peaks are also gradually intensified with raising pyrolysis temperature, indicating the generation of high crystallinity or large size of Co species. In addition, no diffraction peaks of crystalline cobalt oxide phases could be observed. Raman spectra (Fig. 1b) of Co-N-C-T show D and G peaks at 1350 and 1575 cm− 1, which represent defect-induced imperfect carbon and sp2 bonded graphitic carbon, respectively [50]. Comparatively, Co-N-C-800 gives rise to relatively high value of I D /I G (1.13, Table S1), illustrating more defects appeared in graphitic skeleton of Co-N-C-800. Another peak observed at ~670 cm− 1 could be attributed to Raman-active pattern of oxidized Co (Coδ+) that derives from the pyrolysis of coordination structure of 1,10-phenanthroline and Co2+ [51]. Additionally, this peak is gradually weakened with increasing pyrolysis temperature, indicating that, Coδ+ form first, and then react with 1,10-phenanthroline to generate Co0 at higher temperature [52], well agreed with the XRD results (Fig. 1a). Adsorption isotherm of Co-N-C-T (Fig. 1c) displays a type-IV curve and H4-type hysteresis loop at p/p 0 of 0.4–1.0, indicative of mesoporous structure. Moreover, Co-N-C-T displays a clear steep at relative pressure < 0.05, indicating the existence of microporous structure, and the steep is various with the increase of pyrolysis temperature. As shown in Table S2, raising temperature from 500 to 800 °C will lead to obvious increase of BET surface area from 364.8 to 769.7 m2/g. Further increasing temperature to 900 °C will decrease this value to 658.0 m2/g. Among those samples, the highest pore volume could be observed for Co-N-C-800 (0.719 cm3/g). Pore size distribution (Fig. 1d) shows that Co-N-C-T has a considerable fraction of micropore centered at ~0.5 nm and wide size distribution of mesopore in the range of 2–50 nm. It can be found that mesopore volume will increase obviously but micropore volume will shrink when increasing pyrolysis temperature from 500 to 900 °C. CO2-TPD was performed in order to detect the surface base property of Co-N-C-T. As shown in Fig. S1, the patterns of all samples show desorption peak at around 200 °C, while the peak intensity varies for Co-N-C-T. As decreasing pyrolysis temperature, the desorption peak strengthens rapidly and slightly shifts to high temperature (Table S3), indicating low treatment temperature favors the sample with high density of basic sites [48,53]. Element analysis of Co-N-C-T (Table S1) shows that, with the increase of pyrolysis temperature, N content decreases sharply due to the release of unstable N species under high temperature [54]. As shown in Fig. S2, C1s spectrum of Co-N-C-700 shows an obvious tail at 285–290 eV, indicating the existence of NC bond in carbon skeleton. Four peaks denoting C=C/C-C (284.6 eV), CN (285.5 eV), CO (286.4 eV) and C=N-C (288.6 eV) are deconvoluted in C1s. N1s spectrum (Fig. 2a) of Co-NC-700 is deconvoluted into four peaks with binding energies around 398.5, 400.1, 401.1 and 403.3 eV, which are ascribed to pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, graphitic N and pyridine oxide, respectively. The dominant N specie is pyridinic N that could tightly interact with Co species (as shown in Table S1) [40]. Co2p spectrum (Fig. 2b) of Co-N-C-700 could be separated into three peaks with the binding energies at 778.4, 779.9 and 781.7 eV, which could be ascribed to Co0, Co3+ and Co2+, respectively. While the weak shakeup satellite at around 786 eV from the main spin–orbit component is attributed to the surface hydroxyl species (i.e. Co–OH). The morphology of Co-N-C-700 catalyst was characterized by TEM. As shown in Fig. 3 , highly porous structure could be observed throughout the sample, in which big caves (100–500 nm) come from the removal of template, while small caves (3–20 nm) could be ascribed to the acidic etching of naked Co NPs. As shown in Fig. S3, after etching with HNO3, magnetism is disappeared for Co-N-C-700. Thus, most uncovered Co species are removed, and those remaining Co NPs could be encapsulated under carbon shell. Fig. 3a shows that the remaining Co NPs are highly dispersed throughout the porous N-doped carbon, and the mean size based on >100 NPs is about 7.2 nm. It can be observed that Co NPs are embedded by shell of carbon and have a clear plane spacing of 0.206 nm (Fig. 3b), which could be designated to Co (111). Meanwhile, the graphite layer show a plane space of 0.345 nm, coincides with that of C (002). The formation of graphitization shell can effectively prevent Co particles from poisoning or leaching in acidic environment, thus to advance the catalytic performance and stabilization of the catalyst [38]. Additionally, elemental mapping of Co-N-C-700 (Fig. 3c) clearly states that the signals of Co, N and C are overlying to each other, indicating the well-proportioned distribution of Co, N and C at nanoscale."
6,Transfer hydrogenation of FAL with formic acid,"3.2 Transfer hydrogenation of FAL with formic acid The catalytic performances of various catalysts have been tested in transfer hydrogenation of FAL with FA at 150 °C for 6 h (Table 1 ). Blank test shows that nearly no FAL transformation could be observed in absence of catalyst (entry 1). Preliminary experiments focus on the activity of Fe, Cu, Ni, Co pyrolyzed with N-doped carbon in transfer hydrogenation of FAL. Fe-N-C-700, Ni-N-C-700, Cu-N-C-700 and Co-N-C-700 give conversions of 37.8, 45.1, 15.2 and 100%, respectively (entries 2–4), which are accompanied with 47.6, 78.9, 46.7 and 99.9% FOL selectivities, respectively. Large amount of formic ether and 2-methylfuran are generated over Cu, Ni and Co catalysts, while those byproducts seem to be suppressed over Co-N-C-700. It can be observed that the gaseous products were almost H2 and CO2, negligible CO (<0.1%) could be detected (Fig. S4), indicating that the decomposition of FA mainly occurred by dehydrogenation (HCOOH = CO2 + H2) but not dehydration (HCOOH = CO + H2O). A series of Co-N-C catalysts with different pyrolysis temperature have been further tested in transfer hydrogenation of FAL. As shown in Table 1 (entries 5–9), the catalytic activity increases first and then decreases with the increase of pyrolysis temperature of Co-N-C. As for Co-N-C-500, FAL conversion is 41.4%, and the catalytic activity of Co-N-C-600 increases remarkably. Co-N-C-700 demonstrates the highest catalytic activity with a full conversion as well as 99.9% selectivity of FOL. Further increasing the pyrolysis temperature to 900 °C, however, both conversion and selectivity decrease significantly to 21.4 and 63.1%, respectively. Compared with the reported catalysts in the literatures (Table S4) [55–61], Co-N-C-700 catalyst exhibits superior catalytic performance for transfer hydrogenation of FAL at relatively mild conditions. Comparatively, Co-based catalysts (entries 10–14), such as impregnation-derived Co/AC, Co3O4, CoO, Co and Co(AcO)2 afford 19.8, 8.2, 8.5, 9.6 and 12.1% conversions, which are accompanied with 73.7, 90.2, 90.6, 94.8 and 71.1% selectivities of FOL, respectively. The high performance of N-doped catalysts could be ascribed to its rich basic sites, since the FA–triethylamine system is frequently used for improving the dehydrogenation of FA in traditional CTH process [32]. Other commercial noble metals, such as Pt/C, Pd/C and Ru/C (entries 15–17), afford 35–55% conversions, much lower than that of Co-N-C-700. Comparatively, Co-N-C-700 affords TOF value of 88.2 h− 1, which is 1.6–5.0 times higher than those Ni, Cu, Fe, Pt, Pd and Ru catalysts. The high performance of Co-N-C-700 could be ascribed to it high exposure of metal over N-doped carbon (Table S5). Although both Co0 and oxidized Co (Coδ+) could be observed for Co-N-C-700 form its Co2p spectrum (Fig. 2b), XRD pattern of Co-N-C-700 (Fig. 1a) showed that nearly no CoOx or CoNx diffractions can be detected, indicating metallic Co could be the dominant specie in the catalyst. Actually, those mettallic Co is not embedded completely by carbon layers, some cracks in carbon layers could be formed, implying that reactant molecules can have access to the Co NPs through the carbon layers [62]. This speculation could be verified by CO chemisorption (Fig. S8), in which significant CO desorption peak could be observed at 100–400 °C. Based on the results from above characterizations, we propose that metallic Co in the Co-N-C-700 could be the active phase. Using Co-N-C-700 as the optimal catalyst, the screening of solvent was investigated (Fig. 4 ). The two weak polar solvents (butyl acetate and methyl isopropyl ketone) presented lower FAL conversion against the strong polar solvents. As for polar solvents, DMSO provides full FAL conversion but nearly 0% FOL yield. As for polar solvents, DMF and water give rise to full consumption of FAL, the FOL selectivity is only between 40 and 80%. Comparatively, 1,4-dioxane is the best solvent for achieving >99% FOL yield. The effect of catalyst loading on transfer hydrogenation of FAL was also studied (Fig. S9). The conversion of FAL increased from 62.4% to 99.9% when the loading increased from 5 mg to 25 mg. Interestingly, the FOL selectivity is always higher than 97% in the whole range of loading, indicating the good selectivity for transfer hydrogenation of FAL. With the increase of temperature from 190 to 200 °C (Fig. S10 and Table S7), the reaction rate accelerated greatly from 25.78 to 53.76 h− 1. The effect of FA amount on catalytic performance of Co-N-C-700 was carried out in Fig. 5 . Without adding of FA, nearly no conversion of FAL could be observed. When increasing FA/FAL ratio from 0 to 3.5, FAL conversion quickly increases to 100%, which is accompanied with >96% FOL selectivity during the whole process. Although further increasing this ratio to 7 would still afford full conversion, FOL selectivity drops significantly due to the generation of 2-methyfuran (MF) and FF. Selective hydrogenation of FAL using 0.5 MPa H2 as hydrogen donor was also studied in Fig. 6 . Compared with FA, H2 affords both lower FAL conversion and FOL selectivity. As prolonging reaction time to 6 h, FAL conversion increases slowly to 22.6%. During this process, FOL selectivity decreases significantly from 85.2 to 45.3% due to its deep hydrogenation. These results indicate that, using FA as hydrogen source, FAL is easily converted and the as-generated FOL is relatively ‘stable’ and hard to over hydrogenate further over Co-N-C-700. Accordingly, it was validated that FA was favor to the selectivity via hydrogen transfer route [63], and N-doped carbon as support materials can significantly boost the efficiency of metal NPs for FA dehydrogenation [64]. In addition, a gram-scale experiment was carried out using 1 g of FAL as substrate at 150 °C for 6 h (Fig. 7 ). The FAL conversion of and FOL selectivity are 91.3% and >99%, respectively. Therefore, based on above studies, a possible reaction routine is proposed in Fig. S11. A balance between FOL and its ester could be quickly formed, and over hydrogenation of FOL seems to be suppressed over Co-N-C-700. A suitable coupling between FA dehydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation of FAL is the key for affording FOL as the dominant product. Considering the acid environment of solution in presence of FA, the stability of Co-N-C-700 is of great importance for its recycling. As shown in Fig. 8 , Co-N-C-700 could be reused for 5 times without obvious loss in catalytic efficiency. To further study the stability of Co-N-C-700, low conversion (~37%) and > 99% FOL selectivity could be obtained after the fifth (Fig. S12), showing no significant decrease in comparison to the fresh catalyst. ICP-OES analysis shows that Co concentration in filtrate is lower than detection limits, indicating the crucial role of encapsulation for suppressing the leaching of Co in presence of acidic FA. However, the filtrate of Co/AC shows >80% Co leached into reaction solution. As expect, XRD, TEM and XPS characterizations (Figs. S13, S14 and 2) of recycled Co-N-C-700 show that, whether morphology or crystalline phase and surface composition of Co do not change significantly, indicating the stable physicochemical properties of Co-N-C-700 in acidic condition. In order to explore the versatility of Co-N-C-700, transfer hydrogenation of a variety of aldehydes with FA were studied under similar conditions (Table 2 ). As for benzaldehyde (entry 2), Co-N-C-700 affords a full conversion as well as 98.7% benzyl alcohol selectivity. Using 4-hydroxy benzaldehyde as substrate (entry 3), higher temperature (200 °C) is needed to achieve a >90% conversion, and the corresponding alcohol selectivity is up to 99.2%. Interestingly, when substituted group is methoxyl, the main product is corresponding deoxidized aromatic (entries 4 and 5). For example, using p-anisaldehyde and vanillin as subtracts, 95.3 and 91.0%yield of p-methoxytoluene and 2-methoxy-4-methyl-phenol could be obtained, respectively. In terms of benzenepropanal and cinnamaldehyde (entries 6 and 7), the main products are same one-phenylpropanol, and their yields are 91.5 and 91.3%, respectively."
7,Conclusions,"A simple method with 1,10-phenanthroline as C and N sources, Co(OAc)2 as metal source has been put forward for preparation of earth-abundant and acid-resistant Co-N-C catalysts. As revealed by different characterization techniques, the pyrolysis temperature markedly affects their physicochemical properties and catalytic performance. The optimized Co-N-C-700 affords the highest catalytic activity with >99% FOL selectivity in FA-involved transfer hydrogenation of FAL under base-free conditions. Additionally, Co-N-C-700 exhibits a good stability and high performance for various aldehydes. The special encapsulated Co underlying N-doped carbon not only suppresses over hydrogenation of intermediates but also protects Co from deactivation in presence of acidic FA. Therefore, the proposed catalytic setup holds huge potential in industrial applications for transfer hydrogenation of biomass with FA."
