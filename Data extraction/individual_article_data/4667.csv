0,Introduction,"Lignocellulosic biomass, the most abundant sustainable carbon source, has been widely explored because of its potential as renewable feedstock to produce chemicals and biofuels [1–4]. The lignocellulosic biomass comprises of 40–50 wt% of cellulose, 25–40 wt% of hemicellulose, and 10–25 wt% lignin [5,6]. Among these components, hemicellulose is readily transformed to xylose via hydrolysis and further converted to furfural through dehydration reaction ( Scheme 1) [7,8]. The production of furfural exceeds 300 kton per annum and is constantly growing [9,10]. Selective reduction of C-O, CC or CO groups in furfural opens the way to a plethora of value-added chemicals, including furfuryl and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohols, 2-methylfuran and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, among others (Scheme 1) [11–15]. Thus, furfural serves as an important platform compound for chemicals and biofuel production. Among different chemical transformations of furfural, the selective hydrogenation of the CO group in furfural to produce furfuryl alcohol (FA) is highly desirable because FA is an important precursor in the manufacturing of resins, fibers, lysine, lubricants, vitamins, fuel additives etc [16–26]. In turn, 2-methylfuran (2-MF), which is formed upon further hydrogenolysis of FA, is of a high interest as biofuel with the research octane number (RON = 103) exceeding that of gasoline (RON=96.8) [27–36]. Over the past decades, many efforts have been devoted to searching for a suitable catalyst to selectively produce targeted FA or 2-MF. Copper-chromium catalysts exhibit exceptional activity in the industrial production of FA or 2-MF [35,37,38]. However, the high toxicity of chromium precludes their application. A variety of Cr-free catalysts have been studied for selective transformation of furfural to FA [17,39,40] or 2-MF [20,27,38]. High yields and selectivities were reported for non-noble metal catalysts (e.g., Cu, Co) [22,38,41]. However, reasonable activity is usually achieved only at temperatures higher than 200 °C [5]. In contrast, noble metals (Pt, Pd, and Ru) generally exhibit high activities/selectivities under milder conditions (even at RT) [14,42–44]. For such noble metals as Pt and Pd, it was reported that support acidity determines the activity and selectivity of the catalysts. Srinivas et al. reported the variation of the acidity in support materials strongly influences the 2-MF product yield. Pt/SO4–ZrO2 with the highest concentration of Brønsted and Lewis acid site (2.601 mmol/g) exhibited 47.2% yield of 2-MF, while less acidic support Pt/CeO2-ZrO2 (0.325 mmol/g) showed 3.0% yield of 2-MF. The synergic effects between Pt and acid sites of oxide surface promote the formation 2-MF [42]. It was found, that not only the metal nature and acidic properties of the support but also the interplay among metal nanoparticle dispersion and shape, the nature of the support and the chemical state of metal are crucial for the outcome in furfural upgrading [5,13,14]. Thus, various strategies have emerged to improve the product selectivity, namely adjusting the size of metal nanoparticles [43,45,46], alloying them with additional metal species [40,47,48], and enhancing their interaction with support materials [49,50]. Significantly, recent studies showed that the local microenvironment of metal NPs (e.g., confinement effect, hydrophilicity, acid-base features) strongly influences the catalyst performance in hydrogenation of furfural [44,51–53], which provides an alternative approach to tune catalysts characteristics. However, despite a remarkable progress achieved in design of the catalysts for furfural upgrading, the existing catalysts suffer either from poor selectivity, high cost or rapid deactivation [54–57]. As selective conversion of furfural to specific products mainly relies on the appropriate catalyst design, studying new catalysts formulations and structure-activity relationships is still of utmost importance. Very recently, Rh supported on mesoporous silica KIT-6 and functionalized with amine groups overperformed Pd and Pt on the same support [58] but the effect of acido-basic properties of the support on Rh dispersion and activity/selectivity of the catalyst was not studied. Zeolites are important inorganic crystalline materials that comprise three-dimensional frameworks [59,60], which can provide a specific microenvironment to metal NPs by the confinement effect and adjustable hydrophilicity and acido-basic characteristics [61,62]. The confinement effect induced by the rigid zeolite framework is used to tune the size of metal NPs, thus leading to different catalytic performance [63]. Moreover, replacement a Si atom by three-valent element (e.g., Al, B, Ga etc.) in a zeolite creates a negative charge of the framework which is neutralized by a proton or metal cation [59,64]. Such extra-framework cations thus form either Brønsted or Lewis acid sites, which concentrations and strength can be tuned to influence acido-basic characteristics of a support and stabilizing metal NPs. Here, we firstly show the Rh on BEA zeolite as active and selective catalyst of furfural CO group reduction. By adjusting Si/Al ratio and the nature of extra-framework cation in zeolite support selectivity to FA or 2-MF higher than 94% was achieved over Rh@BEA catalysts. The selective hydrogenation of furfural to FA takes place when Rh NPs were supported on the sodium form of BEA zeolites. In contrast, the Brønsted acid sites-assisted hydrogenolysis of FA to 2-MF over Al-rich Rh@H-BEA catalyst resulted in selective upgrading of furfural to 2-MF (98% selectivity at 87% conversion). Detailed study on the performance of Rh supported on BEA zeolites with variable concentration of acid sites showed that the synergetic effect between Rh NPs and Brønsted acid sites plays a determinant role in hydrogenolysis of FA to 2-MF."
1,Experimental details,
2,Synthesis Rh@H-BEA catalysts,"2.1 Synthesis Rh@H-BEA catalysts Prior to impregnation, commercial BEA zeolites in H-form: H-BEA-12.5 (CP814E, Si/Al=12.5, Zeolyst), H-BEA-25 (CP814Q, Si/Al=25, Zeolyst), H-BEA-68 (CP811E-150, Si/Al=68, Zeolyst), H-BEA-150 (CP811C-300, Si/Al=150, Zeolyst) were activated at 550 °C for 6 h (1 °C/min). Rh@H-BEA with different Si/Al ratios were prepared via incipient wetness impregnation with Na3RhCl6 (Sodium hexachlororhodate(III), Sigma Aldrich) to obtain ~1.0 wt% Rh in the final Rh@H-BEA catalysts. The impregnated catalysts were dried for 12 h at 60 °C. The prepared catalysts were named as Rh@H-BEA-12.5, Rh@H-BEA-25, Rh@H-BEA-68, and Rh@H-BEA-150."
3,Synthesis Rh@Na-BEA catalysts,"2.2 Synthesis Rh@Na-BEA catalysts Before the impregnation, all the H-BEA zeolites were exchanged into sodium form by 4-time treatment with a 1.0 M sodium nitrate solution for 4 h using 1 g of zeolite per 100 mL of solution. After washing by distilled water and drying at 60 °C for 12 h, Na-BEA samples were activated at 550 °C for 6 h (1 °C/min). The following synthesis procedure for Rh@Na-BEA catalysts was similar as for Rh@H-BEA. The Na-form BEA zeolites were named as Na-BEA-12.5, Na-BEA-25, Na-BEA-68, and Na-BEA-150, while the synthesized catalysts were designated as Rh@Na-BEA-12.5, Rh@Na-BEA-25, Rh@Na-BEA-68, and Rh@Na-BEA-150."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization XRD patterns of H-BEA, Na-BEA zeolites and Rh@H-BEA, Rh@Na-BEA catalysts were collected on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE powder diffractometer with a graphite monochromator using Cu Kα radiation in Bragg–Brentano geometry. Nitrogen sorption isotherms were measured using a Micromeritics 3Flex static volumetric apparatus at −196 °C. Prior to the sorption measurements, all samples were degassed under the turbomolecular pump vacuum using a Micromeritics Smart Vac Prep instrument; starting at an ambient temperature up to 110 °C (heating rate 1 °C/min) until the residual pressure of 13.3 Pa was achieved. After further heating at 110 °C for 1 h, the temperature was increased to 250 °C (1 °C/min) and maintained for 8 h. The surface area, S BET, was calculated using adsorption data in the range of relative pressures p/p 0 = 0.05–0.2. The NLDFT algorithm using standard Micromeritics software for cylindrical pores was applied to estimate micropore volumes (V mic). The adsorbed amount at relative pressure p/p 0 = 0.97 reflects the total adsorption capacity (V tot). The sizes of Rh nanoparticles were determined by the analysis of scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) micrographs. Rh@H-BEA and Rh@Na-BEA samples were deposited on EMR holey carbon support film on a copper 300 square mesh grid. The measurement was performed using a JEOL NeoARM 200 F microscope operated at 200 kV. STEM images were collected using an annular dark field (ADF) detector. The Rh contents and Si/Al ratios of Rh@H-BEA and Rh@Na-BEA catalysts were determined by ICP-MS analysis (Agilent 7900 ICP-MS; Agilent Technologies, Inc., USA). Ca. 50 mg of the sample was mixed with 1.8 mL of HNO3, 5.4 mL of HCl, 1.8 mL of HF, then transferred into a closed Teflon vessel, placed in the microwave (Speedwave® XPERT, Berghof) and heated at 210 °C (5 °C/min) for 25 min. After cooling down, the complexation of the surplus HF was done by adding 12 mL of H3BO3 and further treatment in the microwave at 190 °C (5 °C/min) for 10 min. Finally, the obtained cooled down solutions were diluted for analysis. The type and concentration of acid sites of H-BEA and Rh@H-BEA samples were evaluated using FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine. Before adsorption, H-BEA, Na-BEA and Rh@BEA samples were pressed into self-supporting wafers with density ~8 – 12 mg/cm2 and activated at 450 °C and p = 5∙10–5 Torr for 4 h. Pyridine adsorption proceeded at 150 °C for 20 min at pyridine partial pressure 3 Torr, followed by 20 min evacuation at 150 °C. The spectra were recorded on Nicolet iS50 spectrometer equipped with DTGS detector by collecting 128 scans for a single spectrum at room temperature with a resolution of 4 cm−1. The spectra were recalculated using a wafer density of 10 mg/cm2. The concentrations of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites were calculated from integral intensities of individual bands characteristic of pyridine adsorbed on Brønsted acid sites (1545 cm–1) and Lewis acid sites (at 1455 cm–1) using extension coefficients ε(BAS)= 1.67 ± 0.1 cm/μmol and ε(LAS)= 2.22 ± 0.1 cm/μmol [65], respectively. To rationalize facile transformation of FA to 2-MF over Rh@H-BEA zeolites, the FTIR adsorption studies of FA on Rh@H-BEA-12.5, Rh@Na-BEA-12.5 and Rh@Na-BEA-68 were performed. FA adsorption was carried out at room temperature for 20 min at equilibrium vapor pressure of the probe, followed by thermodesorption at 25, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350 °C for 20 min and collecting FTIR spectra using the same Nicolet iS50 spectrometer. The intensity of the adsorption band at 2939 cm−1 (C-H bond vibration) was evaluated to estimate the concentration of FA surface species vs. desorption temperature."
5,Catalytic testing,"2.4 Catalytic testing The catalytic reactions were performed in PID 4 Parallel Stirred Tanks Ppcstr19003. Before the reaction, the Rh@BEA or Rh@SiO2 or Rh@Al2O3 catalysts were reduced in tube oven with 150 mL/min H2/N2 (v:v = 1:1) at 500 °C for 4 h (4 °C/min). Then 10 mmol of furfural, 200 mg catalysts, 0.7 mL mesitylene (internal standard), and 30 mL isopropanol were added into a 50 mL autoclave reactor. After reaching the desired temperature, the autoclave was pressurized with 18 bar H2 and the speed of stirring was fixed at 800 rpm. The catalytic reaction with HCl was performed under the same condition with addition of 125 μmol of HCl (Sigma Aldrich, 37%). After 24 h, the catalyst and liquid phase were separated by centrifugation. The organic products were analyzed by gas chromatography using a gas chromatograph Agilent 7890B GC equipped with HP-5 column (length 30 m, diameter 0.32 mm, and film thickness 0.25 µm). Products were identified using a GC-MS system consisting of Thermo Scientific Trace 1310 gas chromatograph equipped with TG-SOC column (length 15 m, dimeter 0.25 mm, and film thickness 0.25 µm) and Thermo Scientific ISQ LT single quadrupole mass spectrometer. The conversion of furfural (Conv.) and selectivity (Sel.) to various products were calculated according to Eq. (1) and Eq. (2), respectively: (1) Conv . ( % ) = N furfural in feed - N furfural in products mixture N furfural in feed × 100 % (2) Sel . ( % ) = N i ∑ N i × 100 % where N furfural in feed is the amount of furfural (mols) in the feed; N furfural in products mixture and N i are the amounts of furfural and product i (mols) in the reaction mixture after quenching the reaction, respectively. All N values used in Eqs. (1) and (2) were calculated based on the internal standard calibration method, using mesitylene (Alfa Aesar, 98 + %) as an internal standard and commercially available furfural (Sigma Aldrich, 99%), FA (Sigma Aldrich, 98%), and 2-MF (Sigma Aldrich, 99%). Leaching test over Rh@H-BEA-12.5 and Rh@Na-BEA-68 was performed by isolation of the catalyst after 1 h and investigation of the reaction kinetics in catalyst-free mixture for another 23 h. Recycling test over Rh@H-BEA-12.5 and Rh@Na-BEA-68 catalysts were conducted under the procedure below. The mixture after one reaction cycle (24 h) was centrifuged at 4000 rpm to deposit the solid catalyst and used ethanol to wash it. After drying, the catalysts were calcined under air at 550 °C for 2 h (1 °C/min). Then, the spent catalyst was reduced and used for next cycle."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalysts characterization,"3.1 Catalysts characterization XRD patterns ( Fig. 1) of H-BEA, Na-BEA zeolites and Rh@H-BEA, and Rh@Na-BEA catalysts showed phase purity and similar crystallinity. All the samples exhibited peaks at 2θ = 7.6°, 14.8°, 22.6°, 25.5°, 27.1°, 27.9°, and 43.5°, corresponding to the characteristic d-spacings of BEA zeolite structure [66]. No characteristic diffraction lines of Rh species, e.g., at 41.2° (d111) and 47.9° (d200) 2θ, were observed in Rh@BEA catalysts. This result is consistent with both the low Rh loading and small sizes of Rh NPs, which do not exceed 2.8 nm based on the STEM results (vide infra). The Rh content in Rh@H-BEA and Rh@Na-BEA determined by ICP-MS measurement were in the ranges 0.72 – 0.98 wt%, which corresponds to the Rh loading within an experimental error ( Table 1). All isotherms obtained with H-BEA, Na-BEA zeolites and Rh@H-BEA, Rh@Na-BEA catalysts exhibited type I(a) characteristic of microporous solids according to IUPAC definition ( Fig. 2) [67]. Micropore volumes and BET areas of H-BEA and corresponding Na-BEA showed similar values varying in the ranges 0.15–0.25 cm3/g and 520 – 759 m2/g, respectively (Table 1). Slight decrease in the micropore volume of Rh@BEA samples may be caused by a partial pore blocking after introduction of Rh NPs in H-BEA and Na-BEA zeolites. Notable nitrogen uptakes at p/p0 > 0.8 observed in the isotherms of BEA-12.5 and BEA-68 samples with smaller crystals (vide infra) are related to the filling intercrystalline voids. While exhibiting similar structural and textural properties, the studied BEA zeolites substantially differ in their acidic characteristics. The concentration of both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites decreased with increasing Si/Al ratio in a series of H-BEA samples ( Fig. 3, Table 2), while all Na-BEA supports lack Brønsted acid sites. Specifically, the H-BEA-12.5 zeolite possessed significantly higher amounts of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites (0.42 and 0.39 mmol/g, respectively) than H-BEA-25 (0.14 and 0.23 mmol/g, respectively), H-BEA-68 (0.07 and 0.10 mmol/g, respectively), and H-BEA-150 (0.07 and 0.09 mmol/g, respectively). This result is in a good agreement with the Al contents in all the commercial BEA zeolites. After introduction of Rh NPs in H-BEA zeolites, the total concentration of acid sites in Rh@H-BEA catalysts decreased by 40–60%. For example, in Rh@H-BEA-12.5 catalyst, the Brønsted acid sites decreased from 0.42 mmol/g to 0.25 mmol/g and the number of Lewis acid sites reduced from 0.39 mmol/g to 0.23 mmol/g, while Rh@H-BEA-68 and Rh@H-BEA-150 catalysts only exhibited small amount of Lewis acid sites and no Brønsted acid sites were detected (Table 2). Such decrease in the amount of acid sites after metal impregnation may be explained by partial ion exchange of zeolite protons with Na+ cations upon interaction with Na3RhCl6 lowering (e.g., Rh@H-BEA-12.5 and Rh@H-BEA-25) or even eliminating Brønsted acid sites (e.g., Rh@H-BEA-68 and Rh@H-BEA-150). All Na-exchanged and Rh-loaded Rh@Na-BEA zeolites showed no Brønsted acid sites, but substantially increased fraction of weak Lewis acid centers (Table 2). Indeed, in contrast to H-BEA and Rh@H-BEA catalysts releasing 30 – 40% of LAS-bonded pyridine at 250 °C (Table 2), negligible amount of Lewis acid sites was capable to hold pyridine in Na-exchanged zeolites at the same desorption temperature. Weak Lewis acid centers detected in Na-BEA and Rh@Na-BEA were attributed to Na+ cations as in Ref [68]. The results of STEM ( Figs. 4, 5) revealed unsignificant influence of either Si/Al ratio or the nature of extra-framework cation in a zeolite support on the dispersion of Rh NPs. Both sets of the catalysts exhibited similar mean size of Rh NPs of 1.7 and 1.6 nm for the H- and Na- forms of BEA zeolite support, although Rh@Na-BEA samples possess somewhat broader metal particles size distribution (MPSD) ranging in 1.4 – 1.8 nm. The corresponding EDS analysis of Rh@H-BEA (12.5, 25, 68) and Rh@Na-BEA (12.5, 25, 68) revealed the homogeneous distribution of Rh species in the samples. Noticeably, Rh@BEA catalysts with Si/Al ratios of 12.5 and 68 (Figs. 4 and 5, c, g) showed smaller crystals than those of Rh@BEA samples with Si/Al= 25 (Figs. 4 and 5, k)."
8,Rh@BEA catalysts in upgrading of furfural,"3.2 Rh@BEA catalysts in upgrading of furfural The influence of acido-basic characteristics of zeolite support on the performances of Rh@BEA catalysts in upgrading of furfural ( Scheme 2) were firstly evaluated at T = 150 °C ( Fig. 6 and Table 3). Among possible products of furfural reduction, FA, 2-MF and 2-(isopropoxymethyl)furan (2 P-MF) were detected over Rh@BEA catalysts (Scheme 2, Fig. 6). The result indicates selective hydrogenation of CO group and intactness of CC ring bonds when using Rh-supported catalyst. The conversion of furfural achieved after 24 h varied in the range 74 – 88%, while the selectivity of Rh@H-BEA and Rh@Na-BEA differed remarkably. In the case of Rh@Na-BEA, lacking Brønsted acidity all catalysts were highly selective towards FA, while negligible amount of 2 P-MF was also formed (Table 3, Entry 4–8). The result reveals insignificant activity of weak Lewis acid sites, either Na- or Rh-associated ones, in etherification of FA with isopropanol. Notably, Rh@Na-BEA-68 with highest Rh loading exhibited the best performance in furfural selective hydrogenation to FA, achieving 94% selectivity (Table 3, Entry 7). Similarly to Rh@Na-BEA, Rh NPs supported on non-acidic SiO2 (with Rh loading 1.02 wt%) and weakly acidic Al2O3 (with Rh loading 0.83 wt%) supports showed predominant formation of FA. Remarkably lower furfural conversions (12% and 56%, Table 3, Entry 10, 11) achieved over Rh@SiO2 and Rh@Al2O3 catalysts are in line with lower dispersions of Rh NPs supported on mesoporous silica or alumina than the ones encapsulated into the micropore voids of BEA zeolite. In contrast to Rh supported on non-acidic or weakly acidic supports, 2-MF was the predominant product over Rh@H-BEA-12.5 (selectivity 98%), containing the highest number of Brønsted acid sites (Table 2). Noticeably, decrease in the concentration of Brønsted acid centers in H-BEA zeolite supports resulted in decreasing selectivity to 2-MF: Rh@H-BEA-12.5 (2-MF selectivity 98%) > Rh@H-BEA-25 (50%) > Rh@H-BEA-68 (3%) ≈ Rh@H-BEA-68 (2%). The Rh@H-BEA-12.5 catalyst gave selectivity of 98% to 2-MF, 2% to 2 P-MF, and no FA was observed among the products (Table 3, Entry 1). Rh@H-BEA-25 catalyst with the concentration of BAS at 0.11 mmol/g still preferentially formed 2-MF (50%) along with FA (22%) and the product of FA etherification, 2 P-MF (24%, Table 3, Entry 2). Complete removal of BAS from Rh@H-BEA-68 and Rh@H-BEA-150 catalysts was accompanied with substantial decrease in the fraction of 2-MF produced (2 – 3%, Table 3, Entry 3,4). A facile etherification of FA to 2 P-MF over Rh@H-BEA-68 and Rh@H-BEA-150 showing strong Lewis acid sites (Table 2) and a lack of 2 P-MF formation over Na-substituted Rh@Na-BEA-68 and Rh@Na-BEA-150 analogues indicate a decisive role of strong Lewis acid sites of a zeolite support in FA etherification. Based on these results, the successful hydrogenolysis of -OH groups in FA obviously requires the presence of both Rh centers and Brønsted acid site, while selective formation of FA is favored in the absence of strong acid centers. To further verify the role of Brønsted acid centers in FA-to-2-MF conversion, the upgrading of furfural over Rh@Na-BEA-68 catalyst in the presence of catalytic amount of HCl was studied. A negligible amount of 2-MF was formed over HCl-containing Rh@Na-BEA-68 catalyst (Table 3, Entry 9). Similarly, the important role of support acidity in FA-to-2MF conversion was reported for Cu-Co/Al2O3 catalyst in Ref. [70], although comparable 87% yield of 2-MF was achieved under harsher conditions (T = 220 °C and 40 bar of H2) than the ones reported here. The influence of the temperature on the performance of the most active catalysts of furfural-to-FA and furfural-to-2-MF upgrading, Rh@Na-BEA-68 and Rh@H-BEA-12.5 was studied in the temperature range T = 60–150 °C ( Table 4). The conversion of furfural over both catalysts decreased with reducing of the reaction temperature from 150 °C to 60 °C (75 vs. 8% and 87 vs. 51% for Rh@Na-BEA-68 and Rh@H-BEA-12.5, respectively, Table 4). At the same time, the high selectivity of FA was maintained at > 93% over Rh@Na-BEA-68 independently on the reaction temperature, while the selectivity toward 2-MF over Rh@H-BEA-12.5 significantly decreased from 98% at 150 °C (Table 3, Entry 1) to 4% at 60 °C (Table 4, Entry 4). Hydrogenation of furfural to form FA, followed by FA etherification towards 2 P-MF, was the main reaction route at lower temperatures over Rh@H-BEA-12.5 (100, 80, 60 °C), which was evidenced by the increasing selectivity of 2 P-MF. Thus, tailoring acidic properties of a zeolite support facilitates selective transformation of furfural to FA over Rh@Na-BEA-68 in the temperature range of 60–150 °C, while hydrogenolysis of FA-to-2-MF generally competes with FA etherification over Rh@H-BEA-12.5 and 2-MF formation is favored with increasing reaction temperature. The recyclability test ( Fig. 7) showed that both Rh@H-BEA-12.5 and Rh@Na-BEA-68 catalysts can be recycled at least 4 times without significant decrease in activity and selectivity towards 2-MF and FA, respectively. Under the reaction condition, the conversions of furfural over Rh@H-BEA-12.5 catalysts decreased from 87% to 71%, while the selectivity to 2-MF maintained at > 87% for four cycles. For Rh@Na-BEA-68 catalyst, the furfural conversion was kept approximately 70% and the selectivity to FA maintained at ≥ 90%. Based on the results of chemical analysis, the Rh loading decreased from 0.72 to 0.56 wt% for Rh@H-BEA-12.5 and from 0.98 to 0.84 wt% for Rh@Na-BEA-68 after the fourth catalytic run. Thus, slight leaching of the Rh species to reaction mixture is the most likely reason of the minor deactivation of the catalysts. However, the leached Rh species were not active in upgrading of furfural ( Fig. 8), as only a negligible increase in the conversion of furfural was observed after removing either Rh@H-BEA-12.5 or Rh@Na-BEA-68 catalyst even after 23 h of reaction."
9,FTIR study of FA adsorption on Rh-supported catalysts: the role of zeolite BEA chemical composition,"3.3 FTIR study of FA adsorption on Rh-supported catalysts: the role of zeolite BEA chemical composition Besides facilitating particular route of FA transformation, etherification or hydrogenolysis, the presence of acid sites of certain type and strength on the surface of a zeolite support is expected to influence the adsorption affinity of a zeolite towards FA intermediate, thus modulating the residence time of FA and determining the extent of its conversion. To address the influence of zeolite acidity on the strength of FA adsorption, FA thermodesorption of Rh@H-BEA-12.5; Rh@Na-BEA-12.5 and Rh@Na-BEA-68 was carefully studied ( Fig. 9). Upon adsorption of FA, all the catalysts under study showed a decrease in the band at 3745 cm−1 corresponding to the interaction of FA with external silanol groups (Fig. 9a). In parallel, the appearance of broad absorption band of H-bonded hydroxyl groups at ~3600 cm−1 was observed. For Rh@H-BEA-12.5, decreasing the intensity of absorption band at 3613 cm−1 revealed FA adsorption on bridging hydroxyl groups [71–73]. The changes observed in OH vibration region of the spectra were accompanied with the appearance of new absorption bands characteristic of FA (Fig. 9b). The weak bands at 1673, 1504, 1460 and 1376 cm−1 in the spectra of Rh@Na-BEA catalysts indicate the molecularly adsorbed FA as the main species on the surface of Na-exchanged zeolites [74]. Besides molecularly adsorbed FA, the spectra of Rh@H-BEA-12.5 revealed the dominance of carbocationic FA species adsorbed on BAS of a zeolite (intensive bands at 1575 and 1487 cm−1) [74] and the formation of diketonic species (the bands at 1714 and 1621 cm−1) [74]. Noticeably, 70 – 80% of FA was removed from both Rh@Na-BEA catalysts at 350 °C, while the most of FA molecules maintained on the surface of Rh@H-BEA-12.5 sample ( Fig. 10). Therefore, BAS not only enable the concerted hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis path for selective upgrading of furfural to 2-MF, as reported in Ref [42], but also provide strong adsorption of FA thus facilitating further transformation of this intermediate on the catalyst surface."
10,Conclusion,"Selective upgrading of biomass-derived furfural to furfuryl alcohol (FA) or 2-methylfuran (2-MF) was successfully achieved over Rh NPs supported on BEA zeolite by varying acidic characteristics of a zeolite support. It was demonstrated that the product selectivity in upgrading of furfural over Rh@BEA catalysts could be enhanced by tailoring the microenvironement of Rh NPs in zeolite support, e.g., by using protonic and sodium forms of Rh@BEA catalysts with different Si/Al ratios (12.5, 25, 68, 150). Under the reaction conditions, Rh@H-BEA-12.5 sample featuring the highest density of BAS selectively produced the targeted 2-MF (selectivity 98% at 87% furfural conversion). In turn, FA was selectively formed over Rh@Na-BEA catalysts lacking strong BAS and LAS (selectivity up to 94% at the furfural conversion of 75% over Rh@Na-BEA-68). FTIR spectroscopic study of FA adsorption and desorption on Rh@H-BEA-12.5, Rh@Na-BEA-12.5 and Rh@Na-BEA-68 catalysts evidences the strong interaction of FA with the Brønsted acid site in Rh@H-BEA-12.5 catalyst can promote the hydrogenolysis of FA to 2-MF."
