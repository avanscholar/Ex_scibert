0,Introduction,"Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are prospective sources of electricity [1–3]. Due to the high operating temperatures of SOFCs, not only hydrogen can be used as a fuel, but also alcohols [4,5], carbon monoxide [6,7] and ammonia [8,9]. The most promising direction in SOFC development is the possibility of using hydrocarbons as fuel [10,11], since hydrocarbons are products accompanying oil production. In conventional SOFCs, a composite material made of nickel and zirconium oxide based electrolyte (YSZ) is commonly used as a fuel electrode (anode). The shortcomings of these anodes are low electrochemical activity and carbon formation when hydrocarbon fuel is used [12]. A more effective material for SOFC anodes would be a composite based on nickel and doped cerium oxide, for example, Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ (SDC), with a high mixed conductivity under anode operation conditions. Ni-SDC anodes have a higher electrochemical activity and are more tolerant to the formation of carbon [13–15]. The electrode reaction kinetics on the Ni-SDC anodes are more complicated compared to conventional Ni-YSZ anodes. This is because both nickel and SDC are electrochemically active in the Ni-SDC anode and the fact that electrochemical reactions can proceed on the SDC surface, on the three-phase boundary (TPB) and with the participation of spillover effects [16]. The study of the hydrocarbons oxidation kinetics on Ni-SDC anodes is a complex task, because the oxidation process of even the simplest hydrocarbon, methane, does not occur in one step, but it proceeds in several reactions with the formation of the proton (hydrogen) and CxHy species [17,18] on the nickel and/or SDC surfaces. Therefore, for a more detailed understanding of the electrode reaction kinetics on the Ni-SDC anodes, a thorough study of the process of hydrogen oxidation, as the simplest electrooxidisable substance, is necessary. Previously, we have studied the kinetics of hydrogen oxidation and water reduction on the Ni-SSZ anode [19] and the kinetics of oxidation of H2 and CO on the ceria-impregnated Ni-YSZ anodes [20]. Herein, we present the results of studies of the kinetics of hydrogen oxidation on the Ni-SDC anode based on a detailed analysis of the EIS spectra by means of the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) and non-linear least squares (NLLS) methods. We also noted a specific effect of ceria introduced into the Ni-SDC anode by means of wet impregnation on the kinetics of the electrode reaction of hydrogen oxidation."
1,Experimental,
2,Samples preparation,"2.1 Samples preparation The 56 wt% NiO +44 wt% Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 composite powder was prepared via the nitrate solution synthesis with glycine used as fuel. The nitric solution of initial powders with the stoichiometric ratio of Ce(NO3)3, Sm(NO3)3, Ni(NO3)2 and glycine were heated to 700 °C for self-combustion. After the combustion, the obtained composite powder was ground and annealed for 4 h at 800 °C to remove carbon traces. An electrode slurry was prepared by mixing the powder with isopropyl alcohol and polyvinyl butyral. The slurry was painted onto both sides of a dense (about 95% of the crystallographic density) plate of a commercial YSZ electrolyte. After drying, the electrodes were sintered at 1400 °C for 2 h in air. The resulting electrode thickness was about 60 μm with dimensions of about 0.4 × 0.4 cm2. The electrode reduction was performed in wet (3 vol% H2O) hydrogen for 1 h at 900 °C. The anode composition after reduction was about 50 wt% Ni + 50 wt % SDC (further Ni-SDC). At the last step of the samples preparation, the Ni-SDC electrodes of the chosen samples were impregnated by the saturated solution of cerium nitrate (Ni-SDC/CeO2). Then the samples were annealed at 850 °C in wet hydrogen for 1 h. Weighing of the samples before and after the impregnation showed that the specific mass of the added ceria was approximately 0.8 mg/cm2."
3,Measurements,"2.2 Measurements High-temperature investigations were performed in wet hydrogen at atmospheric pressure at the flow rate of 33 mL/min in the temperature range of 600–850 °C. The purity of hydrogen was not less than 99.99 vol%. The oxygen activity in the gas was measured by a solid oxide oxygen sensor that was placed near the studied samples. The internal volume of the sensor was purged with air. The sketch of measurement setup is shown in Ref. [19]. The electrochemical performances of anodes were studied by means of impedance spectroscopy using FRA-1260 and EI-1287 (Solartron). The cell was connected to the electrochemical interface in the two-electrode four-wire mode, which permitted the exclusion of the impedance of current-supplying cables from the overall impedance. Pt mesh and Pt wires were used as current collectors and leads. For the distribution of relaxation time (DRT) analysis of the impedance spectra, the original software based on Tikhonov’s regularisation [21] and developed by the authors of [22], was applied. The Z-View software was used to analyse the impedance spectra by the non-linear least squares (NLLS) method. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) study was carried out on a Rigaku D/MAX-2200 diffractometer using CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at room temperature in ambient air. The XRD patterns were recorded in the 2θ range of 15–75° with the step of 0.02° at the angular scanning rate of 4°/min. The SEM images of the powder and sample cross-sections were obtained on a MIRA 3 (TESCAN) scanning electron microscope. In order to obtain cross-sectional SEM images, the electrode pores were filled with epoxy in vacuum, and then the samples were polished by means of a Struers Labopol device."
4,Results and discussions,
5,Certification,"3.1 Certification The X-ray pattern of the NiO-SDC composite powder after annealing at 800°С is shown in Fig. 1 . It can be seen that under these conditions a complete formation of the SDC oxides took place, reflexes of the admixture phases and of the initial oxides were not detected. Fig. 2 A illustrates the SEM image of this powder. The powder obtained under these conditions had a high specific surface and did not have any clearly observed particles. However, the electrode made of such powder did not have a good adhesion to the supported YSZ electrolyte. The electrode agglomerated significantly and fell off the YSZ surface after sintering. Farther the NiO-SDC powder at low effort was pressed into tablets and annealed at 1250°С for 5 h, and then the tablets were ground. Such annealing resulted in a significant enlargement of the powder particles (Fig. 2B) and in the appearance of clearly marked borders between the NiO and SDC phases. The electrodes on the YSZ electrolyte were successfully made of the obtained powder. The solution impregnation technique provided a uniform distribution of the highly disperse ceria particles in the electrode (Fig. 3 A). The approximate anode porosity after impregnation, which was calculated by the ImageJ program, was about 35%. The electrode thickness was evaluated from the SEM image, and it was 55–60 μm (Fig. 3B)."
6,Electrochemical measurements,"3.2 Electrochemical measurements Fig. 4 illustrates the temperature dependences of the electrodes polarization resistances (Rη) before and after the impregnation. The values of the Ni-SDC electrode Rη were 0.28 and 2.57 Ohm cm2 at 850 and 600°С, respectively. The activation energy, which was calculated according to the temperature dependence inclination, was about 0.73 eV. The Ni-SDC electrode impregnation by ceria resulted in the abrupt increase in the electrode electrochemical activity by 10 times at 850°С and by 24 times at 600°С. In addition, the non-linear behaviour of the temperature dependence was clearly observed at the decrease in the dependence inclination angle in the high temperature region. The values of activation energy were about 0.54 eV in the low temperature region and about 0.31 eV in the high temperature region. An analogous behaviour of the temperature dependence had been observed earlier for the Ni-YSZ anodes before and after ceria additions [20]. In Ref. [23] Yun et al. also reported on the noticeable increase in the Ni-SDC anode activity after addition of extra SDC, but the authors did not notice the significant change in the activation energy, which was about 0.6 eV in the temperature range of 750–850°С. The comparison of obtained Rη values with literature data is not entirely correct, because the electrode electrochemical activity depends not only on the composition, but also on its thickness, microstructure and backstory. The increase in the electrochemical activity of the Ni-SDC anode after ceria addition may occur in two cases. The area of the electroactive surface and the number of active sites either increased and/or the pathway of electrode reaction changed. To determine the reasons of the ceria influence on the electrode reaction kinetics, a detailed analysis of the electrochemical impedance spectra was performed by the combination of the DRT and NLLS methods."
7,An approach to analyse of impedance spectra using the combination of DRT and NLLS methods,"3.3 An approach to analyse of impedance spectra using the combination of DRT and NLLS methods Selection of the regularisation coefficient (r.c.) value is one of the problems of the impedance spectra analysis using the DRT method, which was reported in Ref. [22]. At the excessively high value of the r.c., the DRT function is over smoothed and the information on the number of relaxation processes is lost, whereas at low values of the r.c., the appearance of spurious peaks is likely. The combination of the DRT and NLLS methods is one of possible ways to choose the optimal value of the regularisation coefficient. The procedures of the analysis using the combined methods were as follows: 1 - calculation of the DRT function using the experimental impedance spectrum at a certain r.c. value; 2 - determination of the number of relaxation processes and their relaxation frequencies using the calculated DRT function; 3 - fitting the experimental impedance spectrum by the non-linear least squares method using the equivalent circuit, in which the number of (RQ) elements is equal to the number of the peaks on the DRT function; 4 - the impedance spectrum simulation using the fitted results and the calculation of the DRT function of the simulated spectrum; 5 - matching the obtained DRT functions from steps 1 and 4. In the case of their vicinity, we are confident that the selection of the regularisation coefficient in step 1 was adequate. In the case of discrepancy between the functions, it is necessary to change the r.c. value used in step 1 and repeat the sequence of steps 1–5. At the last step, the simulation of the partial spectra and calculation of their DRT functions, correlation of the experimental spectrum DRT function from the point of view of the superposition of the DRT functions of all calculated partial spectra. Using such approaches, we may acquire high accuracy of the results at the impedance spectra fitting. For instance, Fig. 5 illustrates two DRT functions, the first one was calculated from the experimental impedance spectrum of the Ni-SDC anode at 850°С, and the second one was calculated according to the impedance spectrum, which was formed at the simulation using R, Q and n parameters obtained at the experimental spectrum fitting. The DRT functions overlapped almost ideally."
8,Result of analysis of EIS spectra,"3.4 Result of analysis of EIS spectra Fig. 6 illustrates the DRT functions for Ni-SDC and Ni-SDC/CeO2 anodes at different temperatures. The presence of three peaks, which are clearly seen in Fig. 5 and the dominating influence of the peak with the maximum area, which relaxed in the region of middle-frequencies and which shifted into the low-frequency region at the temperature decrease, is characteristic of the Ni-SDC anode. It should be noted that the form of the DRT function for the Ni-SDC anode was greatly different from the DRT function for the Ni-SSZ anode, which was demonstrated in Ref. [19]. On the other hand, the DRT function obtained earlier for the ceria-impregnated Ni-YSZ anode was almost identical to the DRT function for the Ni-SDC anode [20]. This may mean that in the case when highly disperse ceria is present in the Ni-YSZ anode, the mechanism of the electrode reaction was analogous to the mechanism of the electrode reaction in the Ni-SDC anode. The DRT functions of the Ni-SDC/CeO2 anode had only two peaks. In addition, the weak change in the peak area and relaxation frequency depending on temperature was characteristic for the relaxation process in the frequency region of 0.1–1 Hz. Such behaviour has been observed earlier both in the fuel cell with ceria impregnated nickel-ceramic supporting anodes [24] and in the ceria impregnated thin nickel-ceramic electrodes on the supported electrolyte [20,25]. Such behaviour is explained by the gas-diffusion nature of the stage, which is described in detail in Ref. [25]. Fig. 7 illustrates the example of the impedance spectra fitting by the NLLS method. The usage of the combination approach, described in section 3.3 allows the analysis of the spectra with high accuracy with the fitting error χ2 not exceeding 2 × 10−6. The spectra may be described with high accuracy within the equivalent circuit with three connected in series (RQ) elements for the Ni-SDC and two (RQ) elements for the Ni-SDC/CeO2 anodes. The most unexpected result was obtained by comparing the Ni-SDC and Ni-SDC/CeO2 anode DRT functions (Fig. 8 ). After the addition of ceria to the anode, the intensity of the peak of the middle-frequency step of the electrode reaction disappeared at 850°С, whereas all other steps changed insignificantly. The analogous behaviour was observed at 600°С, but in this case, there was a certain overlap in the relaxation frequencies of the middle-frequency step for the Ni-SDC anode and of the low-frequency step for the Ni-SDC/CeO2 anode. Fig. 9 illustrates the temperature dependencies of partial polarization resistances. Table 1 presents the values of activation energy, which were calculated according to the dependencies inclinations. The activation energy values for the Ni-SDC anode demonstrated good correlation with the data obtained earlier for the ceria impregnated Ni-YSZ anode [20]. Therefore, the natures of the rate-determining steps in both anodes under study were the same. Thus, the data obtained for the ceria-impregnated Ni-YSZ anode and the conclusions on the rate-determining steps nature might be true for the Ni-SDC anode. Therefore, the oxygen ion transport in SDC was the high-frequency relaxation process (Rh) at the Ni-SDC anode, the surface reactions between the adsorbed particles was the middle-frequency process (Rm) and the gas-diffusion resistance was the low-frequency process (Rl). The addition of ceria to the Ni-SDC anode caused insignificant changes in the activation energy of the high-frequency step of the electrode reaction (Rh). The activation energy of the low-frequency (Rl) process after the addition of ceria into the anode decreased twice. Let us try to explain the disappearance of the middle-frequency step of the electrode reaction after addition of ceria to the anode. Fig. 10 illustrates the sketch of the electrode reaction mechanism on the Ni-SDC anode. It is well known that [26] the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen takes place mainly at the nickel surface because of the high catalytic activity of nickel [27,28] and high hydrogen diffusion rate at the nickel surface [29]. As the result of surface diffusion, the proton was transported to the three-phase boundary Ni/SDC/gas. Then, it might be oxidized by the oxygen ion from SDC with the formation of water and electrons, which may move to the current collector both via nickel and via SDC, which have mixed oxygen ions and electron conductivity in highly reducing atmospheres [30]. Another possible variant is the proton spillover [31] near the triple-phase boundary from the nickel surface to the SDC electrolyte surface and the water formation reaction proceeds at the SDC electrolyte surface. After the addition of highly dispersed ceria to the anode, the ceria was located mainly at the boundary between the anode particles (Fig. 10). Such distribution of ceria particles has a positive impact on several factors. First, both the length of the three-phase boundary and the surface area of the mixed conductor, where the electrochemical reaction may take place, increase. Second, the possibility of proton jump from the nickel surface to the mixed conductor surface (spillover effect) increases greatly. These factors have a positive impact on the electrochemical reactions, which are associated with the participation of the electrode surface and adsorbed particles. Such is the nature of the middle-frequency process at the Ni-YSZ/CeO2 electrode that was suggested in Ref. [20]. The resistance of the high-frequency step, which was previously interpreted as the oxygen ion transport in the mixed conductor [20], also decreased with the ceria addition. It is likely to be due to the increase in the number of contacts between SDC particles, because of the appearance of large numbers of ceria particles at their boundaries. In addition, we noted that the activation energy of the electrode reaction of the high-frequency step remained almost unchanged after the anode impregnation, which testified the inalterability of the nature of this step. The resistance of the low-frequency (Rl) process also decreased after ceria addition to the Ni-SDC anode. At that, the activation energy decreases almost twice from 0.25 to 0.15 eV. Due to the fact that the low-frequency step of the electrode reaction has a gas-diffusion nature, the ceria addition should not affect its resistance. However, the obtained data demonstrated a different effect. It can be assumed that ceria, introduced by the solution impregnation technique, affects the thickness of the gas diffusion layer, leading to its decrease, which entails a decrease in the gas diffusion resistance (R g ), since there is a direct relationship between these quantities [25], which is described by the equation: R g = ( R T 2 F ) 2 l P D ( 1 X H 2 O + 1 X H 2 ) where l is the diffusion layer thickness, P is the pressure, D is the gas mixture diffusion coefficient, Х is the mole fraction of the gas phase component."
9,Conclusions,"The electrochemical behaviour of the Ni-SDC anode and ceria-impregnated Ni-SDC anode electrodes were studied in a wet hydrogen atmosphere by the electrochemical impedance method. Based on the DRT analysis results, the hydrogen oxidation electrochemical reaction on the Ni-SDC anode was limited by the rates of three processes. The DRT functions obtained for the Ni-SDC anode were found to be in good agreement with the DRT functions obtained earlier for the ceria-impregnated Ni-YSZ anode. The high-frequency step of hydrogen oxidation on the Ni-SDC anode was assumed to be associated with the oxygen ion transport in the mixed conductor. The middle-frequency step was assumed to be associated with the reactions of the adsorbed particles at the mixed conductor surface, and the low-frequency step was assumed to be associated with the transport in the gas phase. The addition of the highly disperse ceria to the Ni-SDC anode by the solution impregnation technique resulted in a significant decrease in the resistance, which was associated with the reactions of the adsorbed particles at the anode surface. The resistance of the oxygen ion transport step also decreased after the addition of ceria to the anode. Based on the correlations between the values of the partial polarization resistance activation energies before and after ceria addition to the anode, the ceria impregnation of the Ni-SDC anode did not influence the nature of the rate-determining steps."
