0,Introduction,"Energy is the foundation of social development and human survival. The limitation of fossil energy and environmental problems caused by fossil energy combustion have forced human beings to develop clean renewable energy (Li et al., 2020, 2018). Anaerobic fermentation can transfer organic matter to gas or liquid energy which has drawn much more attention. Hydrogen has been considered a kind of potential fuel for the future. However, the main drawback of hydrogen production by anaerobic fermentation is low substrate conversion due to the majority substrate energy remained in the fermentation in the form of volatile fatty acids (VFAs), alcohol, etc (Algapani et al., 2019; Baeyens et al., 2020). A promising fermentation method is represented by a two-stage fermentation for hydrogen and methane production. During the two-stage process, hydrogen and VFAs were produced from organic compounds by hydrogen producing bacteria in the first stage, whilst in the second stage, the hydrogen fermentation effluent is used as feedstock for methane fermentation. Two-stage process combining hydrogen and methane production has been widely investigated (Algapani et al., 2019; Salem et al., 2018). During two-stage process, the biogas yield can be promoted by adjusted the pH of fermentation process due to fermentation bacteria can maintain high activity at the optimal condition. pH of 5.5 and 7–8 was the optimal pH for 1st stage and 2nd stage in a two-stage anaerobic fermentation system (Algapani et al., 2019). Under different operating condition, the amount of alkaline substances added was different, and the commonly alkaline substances added were sodium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide (Algapani et al., 2016). However, the method of adding acid-base reagent is suitable for laboratory experiments, it results in an increase in the entire operating cost in large engineering operation, while excessive Na+ and Ca2+ inhibit bacteria activity (Li et al., 2012). Several studies have demonstrated that co-digestion of two or more substrates with complementary characteristics can lead to synergistic effects, resulting in process stability, high substrate energy conversion and costs reduction (Algapani et al., 2019; Silva et al., 2018). In addition, it was also reported that digestate recirculation in two-stage system could enhance substrate conversion and reduce chemical costs due to which prevented VFA accumulation by the renovation of fermentation bacteria resulting in the reduction of chemical dose required to maintain the optimal pH (Algapani et al., 2019). In China, about 100 million tons of FW are generated every year (Braguglia et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2014), which is a potential substrate for anaerobic fermentation. When using food waste as substrate, the organic compounds were hydrolyzed quickly by hydrogen producing bacteria, the accumulation of VFAs lead to the pH lower than the optimal range for fermentation bacteria, resulting in lower biogas yield obtained (Krishna and Kalamdhad, 2014; Wang et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2017). Some studies have demonstrated the increasing of biogas yield from co-digestion of FW and other organic wastes (Awasthi et al., 2018; Silva et al., 2018). However, the different results obtained about the application of digestate recirculation in two-stage system, e.g. Algapani et al (2019) found the hydrogen yield increased by 8% by the recirculation process with food waste as substrate, Kobayashi et al (2012) reported recirculation decreased the hydrogen production from FW. Different conclusions led to interests for further exploration of recirculation process. Furthermore, it is unclear which of the two methods co-digestion and recirculation process is more suitable to enhance biogas production rate and yield, and decrease the amount of alkaline addition for pH adjustment. Compared with other wastes CD owed the advantages of strong buffer capacity and rich nutrients. Therefore, the present work aims to study the influence of co-digestion of FW and CD with different mixed ratio and recirculation process with different RR on the amount of acid-base reagent addition, biogas yield, energy production and substrate digestion in a two-stage continuous anaerobic system."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Raw materials and inoculum,"2.1 Raw materials and inoculum FW was taken from the student canteen of Huanghe S & T University, removing bones, chopsticks, napkins and plastic bags, and then crushed for 5 min with a blender. The crushed FW (TS 21.22%, VS 14.55%, C/N 14:1) was packed in a sealing bag and stored in a refrigerator at 4℃. The CD (TS 18.78%, VS 15.02%, C/N 25:1) was taken from the cow base in Zhengzhou suburb, and the inoculum was provided by our laboratory composed and the cultivation process was detailed in our previous study (Zhang et al., 2017)."
3,Continuous two-stage anaerobic systems and experimental procedures,"2.2 Continuous two-stage anaerobic systems and experimental procedures The experimental facility was two continuous stirring tank reactors (CSTR). The CSTR (H1) with working volume of 2 L was used for bio-H2 production, which was cultured under temperature of 45℃ and strring rate of 120 rpm for 20 min every 6 h. The pH of fermentation was adjusted by 2 mol/L NaOH or HCl to maintain 5.5. The CSTR (M1) with working volume of 4 L was used for bio-CH4 production, which was cultured under temperature of 45℃ and strring rate of 120 rpm for 20 min every 6 h. The temperature was controlled by a hot water cycle system. During co-digestion process, the proportion of FW and CD was 3:1, 2:1and 1:1, and the inoculum was 20% (v/v). For recirculation process with FW as substrate, the recirculation rate (RR) was set to 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6, which was calculated by Eq(1). The methane fermentation supernatant was aerated for 5 min to inhibit the activity of methanogens before recirculation. According to the mass ratio of dry matter, the TS of fermentation broth was 9–10%. The experiment of pure FW was set as the control group without recirculation. The hydraulic retention (HRT) of the first stage was set to 5 d and the HRT of the second stage was set to 20 d. All the experiments were performed in triplicate. (1) RR = Q e Q f where the Q e is the recycle volume of methanogenic effluent (L), Q f is the volume of new influent (L)."
4,Instruments and methods,"2.3 Instruments and methods TS and VS were determined by using standard methods (APHA, 1988), and the carbon and nitrogen contents in FW and CD were determined by using HT1300 carbon and nitrogen element analyzer (Analytik Jena). The collected gas was measured every 12 h, the hydrogen content, methane content and concentration of VFAs were measured by gas chromatograph (6820 GC-14B, Agilent, USA), the operation method was described in detail in previous articles (Li et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2017)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,First stage of the two-stage anaerobic digestion process: Hydrogen production,"3.1 First stage of the two-stage anaerobic digestion process: Hydrogen production The influence of the mixed ratio of FW and CD and RR on hydrogen production is illustrated in Fig. 1 a. For co-digestion process, the average HPR increased gradually with the increase of the proportion of CD, the maximum average HPR value of 3 L/ (L ·d) was obtained at the ratio of FW to CD was 2:1. Further increasing in the CD proportion, the average HPR began to decreased due to increase of non-degradable substances, only HPR of 1.9 L/ (L·d) was achieved at the ratio of FW to CD was 1:1, for FD as the sole substrate the HPR was of 2.3 L/ (L·d). The results showed that co-digestion of FW and CD with complementary characteristics can enhance hydrogen yield at appropriate proportion in the first stage. Comparing to co-digestion, a two-stage with recirculation system treating FW showed better hydrogen production performance, the maximum HPR of 3.3 L/ (L·d) was obtained at RR of 0.4, for RR of 0.2 and 0.4 the average HPR was 2.9 and 2.7 L/ (L·d), respectively. High RR resulted in lower HPR due to the consumption of hydrogen by the hydrogenotrophic methanogens, similar results were reported by Algapani et al (2019). During the two-stage process with co-digestion and recirculation system, no detectable CH4 in the hydrogen production reactor due to the fact that methanogenesis activities were almost inactivated by maintaining the pH around 5.5 (Algapani et al., 2019). During the first stage, FW was hydrolyzed rapidly by hydrogen producing bacteria to produce VFAs and hydrogen, the accumulation VFAs lead to the pH lower than the optimum pH of hydrogen producing bacteria. As shown in Fig. 1b, for the control, 27.8 mL/(Lreactor·d) NaOH addition could meet the pH requirement, interestingly, hydrogen production process with co-digestion able to maintain the pH at around 5.5 required the addition of 12.2 and 7.0 mL/(Lreactor·d) NaOH (2 mol/L) for the ratio of FW and CD of 3:1 and 2:1 which were lower than the control. If the CD content in mixed substrate was too high, acid solution should be added to adjust pH, 8.05 mL/(Lreactor·d) HCl (2 mol/L) was required when the ratio of FW and CD was 1:1 due to the alkaline substance increased with the increase of the proportion of CD. When the hydrogen production processes with recirculation, the addition of 14.8, 9.8 and 12.8 mL/(Lreactor·d) NaOH (2 mol/L) was required for RR of 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 to maintain the pH at the around 5.5. Indicating that co-digestion and effluent recirculation can effectively save the external alkali addition for pH control in a two-stage hydrogen producing system. The amount of alkaline required varied according to the operation conditions. As shown in Fig. 1c, acetic acid and butyric acid were the main metabolites in the H1 reactor. The total VFAs decreased with the decrease of FW proportion, which decreased from 7.9 g/L in the process with FW as the sole substrate to 3.1 g/L for the ratio of FW and CD with 1:1 due to the increase of non-degradable substances. For the process with the recirculation system, the maximum total VFAs of 6.6 g/L was obtained at RR 0.6, which was lower than that from the control due to the recirculation diluted the acidity present in the hydrogen production reactor. When the RR increased from 0.4 to 0.6, the total VFAs increased from 3.9 to 6.6 g/L, the variation might be due to be the methanogenic effluent flow rate and different VFA accumulation in the second stage (Algapani et al., 2019)."
7,Second phase of two-stage anaerobic digestion process: Methane production,"3.2 Second phase of two-stage anaerobic digestion process: Methane production Fig. 2 a illustrates the daily MPR. The average MPR was 2.3, 2.2 and 2.1 L/(L·d) for the co-digestion of FW and CD with the ratio of 3:1, 2:1 and 1:1, respectively. MPR obtained at the control was of 2.6 L/(L·d) which was higher than that from co-digestion of FW and CD, the reason might be due to higher degradable organic matter content in the former, but the HPR from the later with ratio of 3:1 and 2:1 was higher than that of the former, as well as fewer amount alkali solution addition was required to maintain the pH around 5.5. For the MPR with recirculation system showed higher than co-digestion experiments and the control, MPR was 2.9, 3.1 and 2.6 L/(L·d) for RR of 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6, respectively. The fact indicated that methane fermentation with recirculation system was a promising way to improve methane yield comparing to co-digestion of FW and CD. Fig. 2b shows the variation of pH and total alkalinity during different conditions. It could be found that there was no significant difference in pH variation for all experiments, which was maintained at 7.1 ~ 7.8. In terms of alkalinity, co-digestion of FW and CD and recirculation process improved the buffer performance of methane fermentation system, in the current study, the alkalinity increased with the increasing of CD proportion and RR. At the end of methane fermentation, a certain concentration of VFAs remained in the fermentation broth (Fig. 2c), because in a continuous fermentation, in order to get higher biogas production rate, the fermentation broth should be discharged according to a certain flow rate depending on HRT."
8,Comparison of two-phase anaerobic fermentation performance under different conditions,"3.3 Comparison of two-phase anaerobic fermentation performance under different conditions The TS removal (TSr) and VS removal (VSr) efficiencies are shown in Table 1 . When co-digestion was applied, the TSr percentages in the H1 was 30.86%, 25.77% and 21.88% for the co-digestion of FW and CD with ratio of 3:1, 2:1 and 1:1, comparing to H1 reactor, the TSr percentages in the M1 was higher and of 40%, 37.5%, and 30.67%. Similar phenomenon occurred in VSr percentages in the H1 and the M1. When the recirculation system was applied in a two-stage process, the TSr and VSr percentages in the H1 and the M1 were promoted significantly, when the RR increased to above 0.4, both TSr and VSr percentages began to decreased in the H1 and the M1, the maximum TSr and VSr percentages in the H1 and the M1was 35.71%, 52.38%, 48.53% and 71.43%, respectively, obtained at RR of 0.4. However, Algapani et al. (2019) reported that the optimal RR was 0.3 for the H1 and the M1 for TSr and VSr percentages in a two-stage fermentation with recirculation system with FD as substrate (Algapani et al., 2019). The difference might be closely related to operation process and characteristics of biogas slurry. Table 1 illustrates the energy production in the two-phase fermentation process in a cycle (the first stage of 5 days, the second stage of 20 days). The calorific value of hydrogen was 13,000 kJ/m3 and the calorific value of methane was 39, 820 kJ/m3 (Algapani et al., 2019). Using FW as the sole substrate in two-stage system without recirculation, the energy recovered from hydrogen and methane production was only 321.3 and 2820.6 kJ/kgVSr. When co-digestion process was applied, the energy recovered from hydrogen and methane production was improved significantly, the maximum values of 654.9 and 4854.8 kJ/kg VSr were obtained from the co-digestion of FW and CD with the ratio of 2:1. The reason could be explained that the co-digestion of food waste and cow dung enriched the nutrient elements of fermentation liquid and enhanced the conversion ability of bacteria in a two-stage system (Awasthi et al., 2018; Li et al., 2017). However, the increment of the energy recovered from hydrogen and methane production in the two-stage with recirculation system was not significant, higher energy recovered from hydrogen and methane production was of 402.1 and 3402.1 kJ/kgVSr for RR of 0.4, but which were lower than that from co-digestion of FW and CD with the ratio of 2:1, perhaps due to a shortage of available nitrogen. In terms of biogas production rate, the optimal operation was two-stage with recirculation system at RR of 0.4, the HPR and MPR all reached to the maximum value, 3.3 and 3.1 L/(L·d)."
9,Conclusions,"Both co-digestion and digestate recirculation processes showed promising results in producing bio-H2 and bio-CH4 in a two-phase fermentation system, meanwhile which also improved the buffer performance of methane fermentation system. No detectable CH4 in the H1 by maintaining the pH around 5.5. But high CD proportion or RR resulted in lower HPR due to increase of non-degradable substances and the consumption of hydrogen by the hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Co-digestion technology with complementary characteristics and recirculation system were suitable for extracting energy from substrate and promoting the TSr and VSr percentages, respectively."
