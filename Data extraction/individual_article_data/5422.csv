0,Introduction,"Use of hydrogen for fuel cell applications represents one of the most environmentally friendly methods for production of electrical energy. Because of technical and economic issues related to hydrogen storage, generation of hydrogen for fuel cells from liquid fuels is expected to be accomplished on-site by using proper catalytic devices [1–3]. Among the various feedstocks that have been proposed for such applications, ethanol is very attractive because of its relatively high hydrogen content, availability, non-toxicity and storage and handling safety [4–6]. A wide variety of catalysts, mainly supported Ni, Co and Cu [7–16] and noble metals, including Rh, Pd, and Pt [3,14–17], has been reported in the literature. Fatsikostas and others [7,18,19] studied steam reforming of ethanol over both Ni and noble metal catalysts supported on oxides. In a previous paper [20], some of us have investigated the performance of MgO supported Pd, Rh, Ni and Co catalysts in steam reforming of bio-ethanol. Rh/MgO shows the best performance both in terms of activity and stability. Particularly, kinetic evaluations demonstrate a significant difference in terms of the metal specific activity with Rh resulting 2.2, 3.7 and 5.8 times more active than Pd, Co and Ni, respectively. Furthermore, very slow coke formation is observed on Rh based catalysts [14,20,21] and Rh/MgO can thus be considered a promising catalyst for production of H 2 from bio-ethanol. In previous work [20] we have noticed the high stability of Rh/MgO catalysts, which was attributed to strong interactions between rhodium and magnesium oxides, although no effect on the overall catalytic performance was found. Morphology of supported metal particles (crystalline facets, particle size, shape) depends both on the preparation conditions (including loading cq. coverage) and subsequent treatments experienced by the catalyst (including the reaction components). Control of the metal particle morphology is essential because it determines the surface structure of the catalyst particles, hence their activity and selectivity. On the other hand, the support also plays an important role in the control of the particle morphology. The catalyst support is not always a simple mechanical carrier for metal particles since it can modify the electronic properties and hence the reactivity of the particles [22–24], or even migrate over the particles (SMSI on semiconductor oxide supports) [25]. In case, the support affects the catalytic behaviour of Rh, as shown by comparing Rh/MgO and Rh / SiO 2 [26], Rh/MgO and Rh / Al 2 O 3 catalysts [27,28], and Rh on reducible and irreducible supports [29]. No strong interactions between rhodium oxide and γ - Al 2 O 3 or SiO 2 were identified [26,29,30], much stronger interactions were noticed for Rh(O)/MgO [26,29,31]. The observed strong interactions make reduction to rhodium more difficult (yet, still relatively easily [29,32]), hinder aggregation of metallic rhodium and hence sintering and deactivation, and have been accounted for the reported high stability of Rh/MgO catalysts, e.g. in the partial oxidation of methane [26]. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of two distinct chemical precursors and final concentrations of rhodium on the catalytic behaviour of Rh/MgO catalysts during steam reforming of a water/ethanol mixture simulating the composition of bioethanol in order to maximize hydrogen production and minimize coke formation."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation and characterization,"2.1 Catalyst preparation and characterization Catalysts have been prepared by impregnating the support (pore filling method) with solutions of Rh acetylacetonate ( Rh [ CH 3 COCH C ( O - ) CH 3 ] 3 —RhAc series) or nitrate hydrate ( Rh ( NO 3 ) 3 · nH 2 O —RhNit series) in benzene and anhydrous ethanol, respectively. Both precursors were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. Solutions have been prepared by dissolving ∼ 2.0 g of Rh salt in 100mL of solvent. The MgO starting material was a powder ( SA BET = 120 m 2 g - 1 ) , produced by “Martin Marietta”, that was stabilized in a steam atmosphere at 950K for 12h before impregnation. Because of the low solubility of the Rh salts, multiple impregnations were needed to reach the desired amount of supported rhodium. After each impregnation, the wet catalyst was dried at 350K. Finally, 1g of each sample was treated in a reducing atmosphere ( 100 cm 3 / min of H 2 for t = 5 h at T = 450 K ) and then calcined in air at the programmed temperature. The Rh weight concentration ( Rh XRF ) was evaluated “a posteriori” by XRF analysis. All samples were pressed ( p = 400 bar ) , crushed and sieved in a dry-box, and a 40–70 mesh sized powder was used for catalytic tests. Table 1 reports the denominations and main characteristics of the samples prepared. Before each TPR measurement, catalyst samples (50–100mg, freshly impregnated and dried at T = 350 K ) were first oxidised at T ox = 673 K for 30min with 30 cm 3 min - 1 of a pure oxygen stream. The sample was then cooled in flowing Ar to room temperature (r.t.) and equilibrated for 15min (until baseline stabilization). TPR measurements have been carried out in the range of 293–1073K ( α = 20 K min - 1 ) by using a H 2 ( 6 vol % ) / Ar mixture ( F H 2 = 60 cm 3 min - 1 ) . The outlet composition was recorded and evaluated by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) connected to a “hot wire detector” (HWD) controller (CE Instruments). Crystallite dispersion ( D %), metal surface area (MSA) and mean diameter of Rh crystals ( d Rh ) were evaluated by pulse-chemisorption tests using CO and O 2 as probe molecules. A known amount (70mg) of fresh catalyst was charged in a quartz tube ( Φ int = 4 mm ; h bed = 1.0 – 2.0 cm ) and pre-reduced by means of a pure hydrogen flow rate ( F H 2 = 100 cm 3 min - 1 ; T = 923 K ; p = 1 bar ; t = 1 h ). After this treatment, the catalyst was cooled to r.t. with an Ar flow rate of 24 cm 3 min - 1 until baseline stabilization. The outlet composition was continuously monitored by on-line TCD inserted after the adsorbent bed. CO adsorption was evaluated by injecting several pulses of a known mixture of CO (9.4vol%) and He (90.6vol%) in a He (carrier) flow rate of 24 cm 3 min - 1 . Adsorption tests were carried out at normal conditions ( T = 293 K ; p = 1 bar ). After CO chemisorption, the catalyst surface was reactivated with H 2 in the same initial conditions ( F H 2 = 100 cm 3 min - 1 ; T = 923 K ; t = 1 h ) and then washed in a He flow rate of 24 cm 3 min - 1 . At the prefixed oxidation temperature (i.e.: T ox = 923 K ), several O 2 pulses were injected in the He stream ( F He = 24 cm 3 min - 1 ). Finally, the sample was cooled in Ar at r.t. before discharging. The adsorption of each probe molecule was evaluated from the disappearance in peak area. Some reproducibility tests have been carried out by repeating the procedure (pre-reduction of the sample and CO chemisorption). Tests showed a good agreement. With the aim of comparing different prepared catalysts, the experimental data were evaluated numerically assuming that: (a) Rh crystallites are spherical; (b) only the surface of Rh crystallites reacts with CO in the atomic ratio 1:1 [31]; (c) all surface crystallites react completely with oxygen in the atomic ratio 1:2 (i.e. Rh 2 O 3 + 1 2 Ads O 2 ) and (d) the remaining Rh, determined by the difference from Rh XRF and Ads O 2 , is strongly bonded with MgO into the bulk phase and can be considered fully inactive. Under the above assumptions, the metal dispersion ( D % ) is calculated from the molar ratio between the adsorbed probe molecules according to the following equation: (1) D % = ( Ads CO / Ads O 2 ) × 100 . The Rh MSA has been evaluated from the ratio between the Rh surface ( Ads CO ) and total Rh amount ( Rh XRF ) , taking into account the atomic Rh surface of 7.52 A ˚ 2 / atom [33]: (2) MSA = Ads CO · 6.022 × 10 23 × 7.52 × 10 - 20 × 10 - 3 = Ads CO × 45.29 . The mean diameter of Rh surface crystals ( d Rh ) has been evaluated by considering a Rh bulk density of 12.45 g cm - 3 and spherical geometry: (3) d Rh = ( Rh XRF · 600 ) / ( MSA · 12.45 ) . TEM observations were made by using a Philips CM12 instrument equipped with a high resolution camera which allows acquisition and evaluation (i.e. of the particle size distribution) of TEM images. Specimens were prepared by ultrasonic dispersion of catalyst samples in isopropyl alcohol depositing a drop of suspension on a Formvar carbon grid Cu 400. The overall amount of coke deposited on the catalytic surface after each test-run has been determined by CHNS elemental analysis of the discharged sample performed by a Carlo Erba Elemental Analyzer."
3,Catalytic tests,"2.2 Catalytic tests Experiments were performed at atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed linear quartz micro-reactor ( Φ int = 4 mm ; h bed = 1.0 – 2.0 cm ) charged with 0.01–0.06g of catalyst (40–70 mesh) diluted with 200mg of similar sized inert material (i.e. SiC). The experimental apparatus is shown in Fig. 1 . Before each test-run, catalysts were reduced “in situ” at T = 923 K for 1h under flowing hydrogen, and then cooled down to the reaction temperature. Water/ethanol mixture corresponding to the bioethanol mean composition was fed by an isocratic HP 1100 pump and vaporized at T = 400 K in a N 2 stream. Experiments were performed at T = 923 K , ethanol gas hourly space velocity ( GHSV EtOH ) of 100 , 000 h - 1 and steam-to-carbon molar ratio S / C = 4.2 mol / mol . The reaction stream was analyzed “on line” by a Hewlett Packard GC-TCD model 6890 Plus, equipped with a three-columns (Molecular Sieve 5 A ˚ , Porapak Q and Hysep) system. Nitrogen (10vol%) was used as an internal standard to evaluate the carbon balance. GC data were acquired and elaborated by the Hewlett-Packard Interface Bus system (HP Chemstation). On the basis of the complex reaction mechanism [11,15,34], both consecutive and parallel steps can be hypothesized and it is difficult to define a “reaction selectivity”. In order to simplify data comparison we take into account only the following four slow equilibria, defining a “ β ” parameter as the ratio between the experimental constant derived from the outlet mass action ratio ( K exp ) of each reaction (i.e. MSR see Eq. (4) or WGS see Eq. (5)), and the thermodynamic equilibrium constant ( K eq ) provided at the same temperature [35]: (4) CH 4 + H 2 O ⇄ CO + 3 H 2 , (5) CO + H 2 O ⇄ CO 2 + H 2 , (6) CH 4 ⇄ C ( s ) + 2 H 2 , (7) 2 CO ⇄ C ( s ) + CO 2 . Coke formation rate was evaluated “a posteriori” by comparing the carbon content of the discharged catalysts (total), with the instantaneous “ β ” value of reactions (6) and (7). The highest probability of coke formation is reached when K exp values of reactions (6) and (7) are much smaller than the corresponding K eq values ( β ⪡ 1 )."
4,Results,"The reduction profiles of oxidized MgO-supported catalysts were affected by the rhodium precursor and/or concentration, as shown in Fig. 2 . No substantial difference has been recorded in TPR measurements carried out on samples at different T cal from 923 to 1223K (unreported data). While RhAc and RhNit catalysts show both low-temperature reduction (LTR) peaks at about 450–500K, only RhAc catalysts also give rise to a pronounced high-temperature reduction (HTR) at about 790K. On the contrary, RhNit samples essentially exhibit only a sharp peak at T TPR ∼ 500 K . The same peak can also be observed for RhAc samples, but sometimes in overlap. Several samples show some degree of reduction at intermediate temperatures (from about 600 to 700K). The initial catalytic activity data of bare MgO and Rh supported samples, determined from the outlet composition after 0.5h on stream, are summarized in Table 2 . In addition, also the amount of coke deposited after 6h on stream ( C t 6 ) is given. Activity data are also reported in terms of turnover frequency (TOF) vs. Rh particle size distribution (cf. Fig. 3 ) and a trend characterized by two distinguished slopes was obtained. In particular, for small Rh particles TOF significantly increases with the particle diameter (from 2 to 4nm), while for Rh particles larger than 4nm (up to 10nm) only slight changes of TOF were registered. From the activity data of Fig. 4 it is clear that all catalysts are affected by deactivation. In particular, RhAc samples calcined at different temperatures (RhAc1–4) deactivate similarly independently of their initial activity (see Fig. 4a). On the contrary, catalyst RhAc5 with higher Rh loading (5wt%) converts ethanol totally and does not allow to observe any deactivation since the reaction was at equilibrium (Fig. 4b). RhNit catalysts, apart from showing a lower catalytic activity than the RhAc catalysts with corresponding rhodium loading, deactivate more quickly, in particular RhNit2 (Fig. 4b). It appears from Fig. 5 a that the hydrogen selectivity for RhAc catalysts, expressed as mol of H 2 produced per mol of EtOH converted, is similar for all systems independent of the initial conversion value. For RhNit catalysts with a high Rh dispersion (see Table 1), and affected by rapid deactivation (see Fig. 4), the hydrogen selectivity decreases dramatically with time on stream for the catalyst containing 2wt% of Rh (Fig. 5b), but remains almost constant for higher Rh loadings (sample RhNit2 with 5wt% of Rh). The overall catalytic selectivity is described more appropriately by considering the “ β ” factor for the main equilibrium reactions (Table 3 ). As defined in the experimental part, “ β ” represents the “distance” from equilibrium of the outlet mixture. When all reactions are fully equilibrated a value close to unity is expected, otherwise “ β ” assumes different values. We note that the water–gas shift (Eq. (5)) and methane pyrolysis (Eq. (6)) reactions are close to equilibrium, while the methane steam reforming (Eq. (4)) and Boudouard (Eq. (7)) reactions are shifted to the left and right sides of the reaction equation, respectively, because the CO concentration in the outlet is very low and far from equilibrium."
5,Discussion,"Reduction profiles (TPR) of 1% Rh(O)/MgO catalysts (prepared by impregnation of Rh ( NO 3 ) 3 · 2 H 2 O on five different magnesium-containing carrier precursors) have previously been interpreted on the basis of three kinds of rhodium-containing species formed during calcination: Rh 2 O 3 , Rh 2 O 3 interacting with the support, and MgRh 2 O 4 [31]. The spinel was observed on 10wt% Rh(O)/MgO samples after high T calcination (1073K). MgRh 2 O 4 is reduced with greater difficulty (to at most tiny crystallites [26]) than Rh 2 O 3 , which can be reduced at (or below) about 473K [30,36]. In analogy to the aforementioned TPR studies, the low T peaks of Fig. 2 at 450–500K can thus reasonably be attributed to RhO x particles deposited onto the MgO surface, while the high T peak (at about 790K) is indicative of strong interaction of the rhodium species with MgO, i.e. MgRh 2 O 4 . It is apparent that on the whole the interactions are weaker for RhNit than for RhAc, but more uniform. TPR results also indicate that the RhO x species are most easily reduced on RhAc. The temperatures of the intermediate peaks in Fig. 2 (e.g. as observed in RhNit1, RhNit2 and RhAc5) are higher than for RhO x , but much lower than for MgRh 2 O 4 , and are therefore attributed to rhodium oxide interaction with the support without formation of a stoichiometric compound [36]. At smaller diameter of the active phase particles the interaction with the support increases. As a result, the TPR peak at high temperature for RhAc catalysts (Fig. 2a) disappears for RhNit (Fig. 2b). The smaller RhO x particles in RhNit catalysts are probably incorporated by the support, which is unfavourable for their reduction even at high temperature. In conclusion, although the rhodium-containing species formed after calcination differed for the two rhodium precursors used, various degrees of interaction are present between rhodium and magnesium oxides over the oxidised MgO-supported Rh catalysts in both cases, in agreement with other results on such systems [31]. Although it may be envisaged that the observed differences in reduction profiles are related to the internal crystalline structure of the Rh particles (from disordered to ordered) this would not explain the RhAc results, where conversion depends but slightly on the calcination temperature (from 923 to 1223K). As to reactivity, chemisorption is the simplest surface reaction and the first step in heterogeneous catalytic reactions. CO is the most commonly studied adsorbate and of relevance in our case, cf. Eqs. (5) and (7). MSA values, as reported in Table 1, were determined by CO chemisorption. Although it is reasonable to expect a close relationship between metal dispersion (Table 1) and catalytic activity (Fig. 4), the latter depends strongly on Rh loading (Figs. 4 and 5) but is almost unaffected by the calcination temperature which significantly modifies the catalyst properties in terms of metal dispersion. Catalysts prepared with the Rh nitrate precursor are less active than those prepared by Rh-acetylacetonate, notwithstanding a high metal dispersion in the former case. This is indicative of a “structure sensitive” overall reaction, which does not depend upon metal dispersion alone. While many papers have recently been published on ethanol steam reforming [3,4,7–21,37–40], the role of metal particle size has been addressed only in a few cases [4,39]. Our results could indicate that small Rh particles (Tables 1 and 2) not only are less active than larger ones, but also less stable (Fig. 4). Studies on the reactions of ethanol over various metal surfaces indicated that ethanol is adsorbed as an ethoxide species [41,42]. On Rh the adsorbed ethoxide species forms a five-membered oxametallacycle intermediate, which favours C–C bond cleavage [37,41]. Coke formation is one of the most important problems affecting catalyst life time during ethanol steam reforming and interesting considerations can be made from the comparison of results of Fig. 4a, b with Table 2. If we accept that catalyst deactivation is mainly caused by encapsulation of Rh particles by coke [43], it seems nevertheless that coke forms preferentially on RhNit catalysts despite the observed minor decay in activity as compared to the corresponding RhAc samples. Apparently, the smaller the metal particles, the higher is the coke formation rate. Moreover, according to literature evidence [4], formation of the well-known coke promoter ethylene is a considerable problem in ethanol reforming. Several studies on this matter demonstrate that the use of basic carriers like magnesium [14] or lanthanum oxides [40] can minimize coke formation by reduction of the acidic sites of the catalyst that promote ethanol dehydration. However, although the reaction rate is orders of magnitude lower than observed on an acidic carrier like alumina [14], ethylene formation on basic carriers cannot fully be suppressed since ethanol is thermally unstable, and dehydration can take place also in the gas phase. Consequently, hydrogen productivity cannot be enhanced only by improving the catalyst activity towards ethanol conversion, but one also needs to consider the activity of catalytic sites in promoting side reactions which negatively affect formation of the desired product. Reactions producing “solid” coke (Eqs. (6) and (7)) can be evaluated also “on line” by K exp , because their values represent an estimate of the probability of coke formation. Table 3 then suggests that coke is formed mainly by pyrolysis. In fact, in a reaction environment rich in methane and CO 2 (cf. β 05 values of Table 3), reaction (6) moves to the right and reaction (7) to the left. It is also relevant to note the small variation in “ β ” values with time (as a result of an almost constant product distribution) for the RhAc samples, that can be related to the uniform poisoning of the catalysts prepared from the acetylacetonate precursor; the loss of activity (Fig. 4) does not correspond to a variation of the chemical mechanism. The opposite behaviour, observed for RhNit samples, points to a strong effect of the precursor on the poisoning mechanism."
6,Conclusions,"The effect of the metal precursor (nitrate and acetylacetonate) on steam reforming of bio ethanol for H 2 production over highly active and selective MgO-supported Rh catalysts was investigated. Analysis of experimental data allows to draw the following conclusions: • The precursor affected to notable extents the dispersion of rhodium, the reduction profile of the oxidised catalyst and the resistance to deactivation due to carbon deposition. • Remarkable differences between the two catalyst series (RhNit and RhAc) are on account of Rh crystallites with different size and surface area. For the same rhodium loading, RhNit catalysts have smaller active phase particles than RhAc catalysts. • TPR results suggest the presence of three distinct metallic species, namely free Rh 2 O 3 on the surface, Rh 2 O 3 interacting with the support, and MgRh 2 O 4 . • Initial TOF values, calculated from the “chemical sites” distribution and initial conversion ( t = 0.5 h ) range from 9.5 to 22.5 s - 1 for the RhAc series and from 2.0 to 4.5 s - 1 for RhNit. • Ethanol steam reforming appears as a “structure sensitive” reaction. • Because of coking, conversion decays on stream even by using an excess of water (steam/carbon = 4.2mol/mol). Coke deposits increase with smaller diameter of Rh particles. Mass action ratios suggest that coke is formed more easily through methane pyrolysis than through the Boudouard reaction."
