0,Introduction,"Photocatalytic production of clean hydrogen (H2) fuel from water splitting via semiconductor-based photocatalysis are deemed as an ideal paradigm of converting solar energy into chemical energy, which is promising to solve the global energy and environmental problems [1,2]. For the photocatalytic water splitting, the photoexcited electrons are employed to reduce protons into H2; whereas, the photoexcited holes are usually hard to oxidize water to evolve oxygen (O2) due to the high overpotential and sluggish kinetics of water oxidation [3,4]. The remained photoexcited holes would recombine with the photoexcited electrons or cause the photocorrosion of photocatalysts, leading to the low efficiency and poor stability of photocatalytic H2 production from water splitting [5]. Although the employment of sacrificial agents to consume photogenerated holes has greatly improved the efficiency of photocatalytic water splitting for H2 evolution, these strategies not only raise production cost and generate more pollutants but also waste the oxidation ability of photoexcited holes [6,7]. Therefore, an appropriate reaction substrate, which can be selectively converted to the high-value products by consuming photoexcited holes, is preferred to replace the hole-sacrificial agents for the oxidative half-reaction. In recent years, photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde has attracted extensive attention because it offers an eco-friendly and economical strategy to produce fine chemicals via a sustainable way [8,9]. The photogenerated holes and reactive oxygen species (such as ·O2 − and ·OH) derived from water oxidation can act as oxidants to drive the transformation of benzyl alcohol [10,11]. The integration of photocatalytic proton reduction with selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol in a closed redox cycle is expected to achieve the efficient utilization of photogenerated electrons and holes for coproduction of hydrogen fuel and valuable chemicals [12–15]. Accordingly, the development of semiconductor-based photocatalysts with high activity, selectivity and stability for such a reaction system is highly desired but still remains a challenging task. As an alternative to TiO2, niobic acids (HNbO3, HNb3O8, H4Nb6O17, etc.) have been found great potentials in photocatalytic applications, such as water splitting [16,17], organic transformation [18,19], pollutant removal [20], and carbon dioxide reduction [21]. Niobic acids have exhibited the superior photocatalysis to their corresponding niobates owing to the more favorable valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) levels as well as their surface acid sites [22,23]. However, the niobic acids without surface modification still suffer from low photocatalytic efficiency of hydrogen production due to the shortcomings of photoexcited electron–hole recombination and sluggish hydrogen-evolution kinetics. Loading metal cocatalyst has been demonstrated an effective approach to accelerating photoexcited electron-hole separation and boosting interfacial oxidation − reduction kinetics [24,25]. Recently, highly dispersive metal species (such as single atoms and nanoclusters) are developed to serve as more active cocatalysts, to increase the utilization of metal and reduce the cost of photocatalysts [26,27]. In particular, loading metal on reducible transition metal oxides can create the strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) [28,29], which not only helps to stabilize highly dispersive metal species but also remarkably alters the geometric and electronic structures of photocatalyst surface, thereby influencing the photocatalytic activity, selectivity, and stability [30,31]. Moreover, the photocatalytic performance can be further enhanced by the unique metal-semiconductor synergistic effects, especially for a reducible oxide semiconductor like niobic acid [32,33]. Specifically, surface oxygen vacancies (VOs) of the oxide semiconductors can prolong the photoexcited charge-carrier lifetimes and promote the affinity of reactant molecules (e.g. H2O and organic substrates) to the surface of photocatalysts [18]. The metal–VO dual active sites on oxide–semiconductor photocatalysts could synergistically boost the photocatalytic reactions. Zhou et al. demonstrated that the Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst concentrating VOs at metal–oxide interface enabled an ultrahigh hydrogen yield from methanol aqueous solution [34]. Xiao et al. reported that the synergy of atomic Ni co‐catalyst and surface VOs resulted in a remarkable increase in H2 evolution from photocatalytic water splitting [35]. Therefore, it is desirable to construct a photocatalyst with highly dispersive metal species and easily tunable surface oxygen vacancies, which holds great promise to boost the photocatalytic coproduction of H2 and high-value chemicals. Although many of previous studies have identified that Pt is more active for H2 evolution [5], its applications are restricted by the high cost. As a relatively cheap platinum group metal, palladium (Pd) is a favorable alternative to develop the photocatalysts with high performance and low cost toward the coproduction of hydrogen and value-added chemicals [36,37]. Herein, we report an efficient and robust photocatalyst consisting of Pd nanoclusters anchored on porous HNb3O8 with abundant surface VOs, which was synthesized by the thermal treatment of Pd2+-incorporated HNb3O8 precursor in H2/Ar mixed gas at 300 °C for an optimal duration (denote as Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst). The existence of Pd favors the formation of VOs on HNb3O8 during H2 reduction, achieving the synchronous construction of Pd and VO dual active sites. The optimal Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst with Pd loading amount as low as 0.41 wt% exhibits the superior performance toward photocatalytic coproduction of H2 and benzaldehyde from benzyl-alcohol aqueous solution, achieving the production rates of H2 and benzaldehyde to be 3.17 and 2.76 mmol·gcat −1 h−1, which surpass those of the other Pd/HNb3O8 photocatalysts. Combining experimental results and theoretical calculations, we explored the synergistic mechanism of Pd and VO dual active sites on HNb3O8 for promoting the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution coupled with selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Niobium chloride (NbCl5), ethanol, tetramethylammonium hydroxide pentahydrate (C4H13NO·5H2O, TMAOH), nitric acid (HNO3, 65−68 wt.%), acetone, ammonium tetrachloropalladate ((NH4)2PdCl4), chloroauric acid trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O), chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O), nickel chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O), hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), benzyl alcohol (BA), triethanolamine (TEOA), benzotrifluoride (BTF) and 5,5-dimethyl-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) were obtained from Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd."
3,Synthesis of porous HNb3O8,"2.2 Synthesis of porous HNb3O8 Porous HNb3O8 was synthesized through a previously reported method with minor modifications [18]. Typically, 0.8105 g NbCl5 was dissolved in 10 mL absolute ethanol, followed with adding 10 mL TMAOH aqueous solution (15 wt.%) to form a white suspension. After stirred for 2 h, the suspension was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave, which was sealed and kept at 200 °C for 12 h. After cooled to room temperature, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed with acetone, absolute ethanol and deionized water in sequence. Subsequently, the precipitate was dispersed into 40 mL nitric acid (6 M) and stirred for 12 h to achieve the ion exchange of TMA+ cations with protons. Finally, the HNb3O8 product was collected by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol, and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven."
4,Synthesis of Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalysts,"2.3 Synthesis of Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalysts Firstly, the Pd2+-incorporated HNb3O8 (Pd2+/HNb3O8) precursor was prepared by an impregnation process. Typically, 200 mg of the as-prepared HNb3O8 sample was dispersed in 20 mL deionized water, followed by injecting 2 mL (NH4)2PdCl4 aqueous solution (0.01 M). After 6 h stirring, the precipitate was collected and dried at 60 °C in vacuum, obtaining the Pd2+/HNb3O8 precursor. Subsequently, the Pd/HNb3O8-H2 samples were prepared by thermal reduction of the Pd2+/HNb3O8 precursor in H2/Ar mixed gas. Specifically, 200 mg of the Pd2+/HNb3O8 precursor was placed in a tube furnace, which was filled with H2(5 vol.%)/Ar(95 vol.%) mixed gas and kept at 300 °C for a certain duration. The Pd/HNb3O8-H2 samples obtained via the thermal reduction for different durations (0.5, 1, 2 and 3 h) are denoted as Pd/HNb3O8-H2-0.5, Pd/HNb3O8-H2-1, Pd/HNb3O8-H2-2 and Pd/HNb3O8-H2-3, respectively. For comparison, a variety of other photocatalysts, such as Pd/HNb3O8-N2, Pd/HNb3O8-air, HNb3O8-H2, HNb3O8-N2, HNb3O8-air, and different M/HNb3O8-H2 (M = Ni, Au, Pd, Pt) were prepared by the similar procedure with that for preparing Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst. The details are described in Supporting Information."
5,Characterization,2.4 Characterization The details of all characterizations are described in Supporting Information. The amount of photogenerated electrons stored on photocatalysts was analyzed quantitatively by an electron titration method with thionine acetate as titrant [38].
6,Computational method,"2.5 Computational method Based on the density functional theory (DFT), both HNb3O8(001) and HNb3O8(001)+Pd surfaces were built, where the vacuum space along z direction was set to be 20 Å to avoid the interaction between neighboring images. Three different VO sites were built on HNb3O8(001) and HNb3O8(001)+Pd surfaces, respectively. The formation energy of VO was determined by the equation: Δ E V o = E − E V o − μ o where E and E V o represent the energy of the surfaces without and with VO, and μO represents the chemical potential of oxygen atom Then, the H2O or benzyl alcohol (C6H5CH2OH) molecule was adsorbed on the surfaces. The adsorption energies of H2O and C6H5CH2OH were calculated by the equation: ΔEA = E*A – E* – EA, where E*A , E* and EA denote the energies of adsorbed system, clear surface and adsorbate (A = H2O and C6H5CH2OH), respectively. For all the systems, the three atomic layers at top were relaxed and the three atomic layers at bottom were fixed."
7,Photocatalytic performance test,"2.6 Photocatalytic performance test The photocatalytic coproduction of H2 and benzaldehyde was conducted in an automatic on-line analysis system (Labsolar-6A, Beijing Perfectlight) under Ar atmosphere, with the irradiation from a Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300). For a photocatalytic reaction, 0.5 mL benzyl alcohol and 5 mg photocatalyst were added in 50 mL CTAB (0.1 M) aqueous solution, where CTAB facilitated the dissolution of benzyl alcohol. The reaction system was thoroughly degassed, stirred in dark for 1 h, and then exposed to the Xe-lamp irradiation (optical power density: 200 mW cm−2). The temperature of reaction system was controlled at 8 °C by a circular water cooling system. The gas product was analyzed quantitatively by a gas chromatograph (GC 9790 II, FuLi). The products in solution were detected by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Shimadzu LC-2030 Plus) with a UV detector at 256 nm and C18 column, where the mobile phase was composed of 25 % acetonitrile and 75 % water and the flow rate was 1 mL/ min. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of photocatalytic reaction was determined as described in Supporting Information."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Chemical compositions and microstructures of photocatalysts,"3.1 Chemical compositions and microstructures of photocatalysts The synthesis of Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst with Pd and VO dual active sites is schematically shown in Fig. 1 a. Firstly, the pristine HNb3O8 was synthesized via the solvothermal and protonation processes. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) images (Fig. S1, Supporting Information) indicate that the as-prepared HNb3O8 sample possess porous structure built by numerous nanoparticles (NPs) with ultrasmall sizes of 5−7 nm. XRD pattern (Fig. S2, Supporting Information) of the HNb3O8 sample shows broad diffraction peaks assignable to the orthorhombic HNb3O8 (JCPDS No. 37-833) because the ultrasmall particle sizes result in the low crystallinity. Subsequently, Pd was anchored onto the surface of porous HNb3O8 via the impregnation and thermal H2 reduction processes, to obtain the Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst with Pd and VO dual active sites. According to the H2 temperature-programmed-reduction (TPR) result (Fig. S3, Supporting Information), the thermal treatment of Pd2+/HNb3O8 precursor in H2/Ar mixed gas at 300 °C could achieve the complete reduction of Pd2+ ions into Pd° and the generation of VOs on the surface of HNb3O8. As shown in Fig. 1b, the Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst exhibits the similar porous structure with that of the pristine HNb3O8. In the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst (Fig. 1c), the distinct lattice spacing of 3.05 Å is indexed to the (060) plane of orthorhombic HNb3O8. However, the lattice of metallic Pd is hardly observed due to its low content and high dispersion [39]. The highly dispersive Pd species in Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst are identified by aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (AC-HAADF-STEM) images (Figs. 1d and S4), where several brighter domains less than 2 nm should be Pd nanoclusters. The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) confirms the existence of Nb, O, and Pd elements in the Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst, as depicted in Fig. 1e, where Pd element evenly distributes on the HNb3O8 support. Furthermore, the actual Pd content of the Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst is measured to be 0.41 wt.% by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-AES). These results affirm that the highly dispersive Pd sites have been anchored on the surface of HNb3O8. XRD pattern (Fig. S2, Supporting Information) of the Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst indicates that the crystallinity of HNb3O8 is unchanged after Pd modification by H2 thermal reduction. No diffraction peak of Pd is observed due to its high dispersion and low content, consistent with the above TEM observations. The specific surface areas and porous structures of several typical samples (HNb3O8, HNb3O8-H2, and Pd/HNb3O8-H2) were characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption measurements. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. 2 ) of the three samples reflect their mesoporous structures [16]. According to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model, the specific surface areas of HNb3O8, HNb3O8-H2, and Pd/HNb3O8-H2 are determined to be 291.6, 296.8 and 263.3 m2 g−1 (Table S1, Supporting Information), respectively, indicating that the H2 thermal reduction has barely changed the surface area of HNb3O8 while the introduction of Pd caused a slight decrease in the specific surface area. The three samples have the approximate pore structures with average pore sizes around 3.0 nm and pore volumes of 0.20−0.30 cm3 g-1, respectively. The surface elements and chemical states of Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst are probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), in comparison with those of HNb3O8-H2 sample. The survey spectra (Fig. S5, Supporting Information) of both samples present the obvious signals of Nb, O, and C elements. The Nb 3d spectra (Fig. 3 a) are deconvoluted into two doublets of Nb 3d5/2 and Nb 3d3/2, where the predominant peaks at 207.3 and 210.0 eV correspond to Nb5+ cations while the weak peaks at 206.7 and 209.4 eV are assigned to Nb4+ cations [18]. The percentage of Nb4+ in Pd/HNb3O8-H2 is evaluated to be 27.5 %, higher than that (17.2 %) in HNb3O8-H2 sample, suggesting that the introduction of Pd could promote the generation of VOs on HNb3O8. The peaks of O 1s spectrum (Fig. 3b) for Pd/HNb3O8-H2 have about 0.2 eV shift towards low energy in comparison with those of HNb3O8-H2, which should be ascribed to the formation of abundant VOs [40]. The O 1s spectra of both HNb3O8-H2 and Pd/HNb3O8-H2 samples can be fitted with three peaks at 530.2/530.0 eV, 531.4/531.2 eV, 532.3/532.1 eV, respectively, corresponding to the lattice oxygen of HNb3O8, the oxygen related to VOs and the surface adsorbed oxygen [41]. The oxygen related to VOs accounts for 10.6 % and 15.4 % for HNb3O8-H2 and Pd/HNb3O8-H2, respectively, confirming that the latter has more surface VOs. The Pd 3d spectrum (Fig. 3c) of Pd/HNb3O8-H2 displays very weak peaks due to low Pd content, which can be fitted with two pairs of peaks corresponding to metallic Pd0 and cationic Pd2+, respectively [42]. In order to identify the dispersed states of Pd, CO diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (CO-DRIFTS) was employed to characterize the Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst, by comparison with the Pd2+/HNb3O8 precursor, as shown in Fig. 3d. For Pd2+/HNb3O8 precursor, only one sharp peak at 2166 cm−1 is observed, which belongs to the stretching frequency of linear-adsorbed CO on the isolated Pd2+ sites [43]. This confirms that Pd2+ ions have been steadily adsorbed and evenly distributed on the surface of HNb3O8. However, the spectrum of Pd/HNb3O8-H2 sample shows two broad bands centered at 2089 and 1929 cm−1, respectively, corresponding to the linear-adsorbed CO and the threefold-hollow-adsorbed CO on Pd nanoclusters [44,45]. This indicates that the thermal treatment of Pd2+/HNb3O8 precursor at 300 °C in H2/Ar mixed gas for 1 h has transferred the chemisorbed Pd2+ ions into Pd nanoclusters on HNb3O8. Furthermore, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was recorded to prove the formation of abundant VOs in the Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst, by comparison with the pristine HNb3O8 and HNb3O8-H2 samples. As shown in Fig. 3e, no signal is observed in the EPR spectrum of pristine HNb3O8. In contrast, both HNb3O8-H2 and Pd/HNb3O8-H2 samples exhibit a distinct signal of VO with g = 2.002 in EPR spectra, indicating that the thermal treatment in H2/Ar atmosphere at 300 °C could induce to the formation of VOs on HNb3O8. By comparison, the remarkably higher VO signal of Pd/HNb3O8-H2 suggests the facilitated formation of VOs on HNb3O8 in the presence of Pd. Furthermore, the formation of VOs on HNb3O8 without and with Pd was studied theoretically. As shown in Fig. 3f, DFT calculation indicates that the formation energy of VO on Pd/HNb3O8 is 2.68 eV, which is lower than the value (2.95 eV) on bare HNb3O8. Additionally, the existence of Pd sites could efficiently dissociate H2 and allow it to spill over onto HNb3O8 during the thermal H2 reduction, which could further promote the generation of VOs on HNb3O8 [46,47]. Therefore, the existence of Pd facilitates the generation of VOs on the surface of HNb3O8 during the thermal H2 reduction."
10,Photoexcitation and photoelectrochemical properties,"3.2 Photoexcitation and photoelectrochemical properties The photoabsorption properties and band gaps of HNb3O8, HNb3O8-H2 and Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalysts were determined by UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–vis DRS, Fig. 4 a). The three samples exhibit the similar photoabsorption in ultraviolet region (λ < 400 nm) but a large difference in visible light region. Compared with pristine HNb3O8, both HNb3O8-H2 and Pd/HNb3O8-H2 present the notably enhanced absorption in visible light region owing to the introduction of surface VOs or both Pd and VOs. The optical bandgaps of HNb3O8, HNb3O8-H2 and Pd/HNb3O8-H2 were estimated to be 3.12, 2.90 and 2.77 eV, respectively, according to the Tauc plots (Fig. S6, Supporting Information). The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 4b) of photocatalysts were recorded to evaluate the separation efficiency of photoexcited electrons and holes. Among the three photocatalysts of HNb3O8, HNb3O8-H2 and Pd/HNb3O8-H2, pristine HNb3O8 exhibits the highest PL intensity around 450 nm upon the excitation of 220 nm, suggesting the highest probability of electron-hole recombination. With introducing Pd and surface VOs, the fluorescence emission of Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst was almost completely quenched, meaning that the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole was suppressed. Transient photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) were measured to further reveal the separation and transfer efficiencies of photogenerated charge carriers in the photocatalysts. In comparison, Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst generates the highest photocurrent intensity (Fig. 4c), which is consistent with the quenched PL emission and confirms the highest separation efficiency of photoexcited charge carriers in Pd/HNb3O8-H2 [16]. The EIS Nyquist plot (Fig. 4d) of Pd/HNb3O8-H2 shows the smallest arc radius, reflecting the highest charge migration capability of this material. These results attest that the construction of Pd sites and surface VOs on HNb3O8 could greatly improve the separation and transfer of photoexcited charge carriers [24]. Additionally, Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots of the photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 4e, in which the positive slopes manifest the n-type semiconductor characteristic of photocatalysts [23]. The M–S plot of Pd/HNb3O8-H2 has the smallest slope, suggesting the highest charge carrier density of this photocatalyst [48]. The flat band potentials of HNb3O8, HNb3O8-H2 and Pd/HNb3O8-H2 are measured to be -0.93, -0.70 and -0.56 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively, which can be converted to the values relative to the normal hydrogen electrode (vs. NHE, pH = 0) according to the following formula: E(vs. NHE) = E(vs. Ag/AgCl) + Eθ (Ag/AgCl), where Eθ (Ag/AgCl) is 0.197 V at 298 K. Therefore, the flat-band potentials of HNb3O8, HNb3O8-H2 and Pd/HNb3O8-H2 are calculated to be -0.73, -0.50 and -0.36 V (vs. NHE, pH = 0), respectively. Since the flat band potential is approximate to the conduction band minimum (CBM), the valance band maximum (VBM) values of HNb3O8, HNb3O8-H2 and Pd/HNb3O8-H2 are estimated to be 2.39, 2.40 and 2.41 V, respectively, according to their optical band gaps [49]. In consequence, as illustrated in Fig. 4f, the photoexcited electrons in conduction band have a negative potential enough for proton reduction and the holes in valance band are capable of oxidizing benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde [14,50]."
11,Photocatalytic performance for coproduction of H2 and benzaldehyde,"3.3 Photocatalytic performance for coproduction of H2 and benzaldehyde According to the above analyses, the Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst with abundant surface active sites and unique electronic properties is expected to exhibit the excellent performance for photocatalytic hydrogen production coupled with selective benzyl-alcohol oxidation (Fig. 5 a). The performance of photocatalysts were determined by a typical reaction system with 500 μL benzyl alcohol and 5 mg photocatalyst in 50 mL deionized water with CTAB (0.1 M) for dissolution enhancement. As shown in Figs. 5b-e, Fig. S7 and Table S2 (Supporting Information), the photocatalysts exhibit the linearly increased H2 evolution to varying degrees along with irradiation time and the excellent selectivity (99 %) for benzaldehyde production. Both the pristine HNb3O8 and HNb3O8-H2 samples exhibit very inferior photocatalysis for producing H2 and benzaldehyde (I and II in Fig. 5b). With adsorbing Pd2+ on pristine HNb3O8 via the impregnation process, the Pd2+/HNb3O8 sample shows a little increased photocatalysis but it is far from adequate (III in Fig. 5b). In contrast, the thermal treatment of Pd2+/HNb3O8 in H2/Ar mixed gas at 300 °C for 1 h results in a significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity toward the coproduction of H2 and benzaldehyde. Among various samples, the Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst exhibits the most outstanding performance (IV in Fig. 5b), achieving the highest production rates of H2 (3.17 mmol·gcat −1 h−1) and benzaldehyde (2.76 mmol·gcat −1 h−1). To elucidate the dominant factors influencing the photocatalytic activity, the performance of different photocatalysts prepared by controlling conditions were evaluated for comparison. The Pd/HNb3O8-photo photocatalyst (V in Fig. 5b), prepared by loading Pd NPs on the pristine HNb3O8 via a photodeposition method, exhibits a medium performance between those of Pd2+/HNb3O8 and Pd/HNb3O8-H2. After the thermal treatment of Pd/HNb3O8-photo in H2/Ar mixed gas at 300 °C for 1 h, the photocatalytic performance of Pd/HNb3O8-photo-H2 (VI in Fig. 5b) is also obviously enhanced. The results corroborate that the Pd-modified defective HNb3O8 with Pd-VO dual active sites is highly efficient for photocatalytic coproduction of H2 and benzaldehyde from benzyl-alcohol aqueous solution. Additionally, the superior photocatalysis of Pd/HNb3O8-H2 to that of Pd/HNb3O8-photo-H2 testifies that the synchronously constructed Pd-VO dual active sites on HNb3O8 during the thermal reduction are more efficient in the photocatalytic reaction, which is possibly owing to the dispersive Pd sites and the abundant Pd-O-Nb atomic interface [35,37]. To further elaborate the effect of Pd-VO dual active sites on the photocatalytic efficiency, several photocatalysts (HNb3O8-air, HNb3O8-N2, HNb3O8-H2, Pd/HNb3O8-air, Pd/HNb3O8-N2 and Pd/HNb3O8-H2) prepared by the thermal treatment of pristine HNb3O8 and Pd2+/HNb3O8 in different atmosphere (air, N2 and H2/Ar) was studied contrastively, as shown in Fig. 5c and Fig. S7b. Firstly, all the Pd-modified HNb3O8 photocatalysts exhibit much superior photocatalysis than the HNb3O8 samples without Pd loading, which indicates that the Pd active sites on HNb3O8 play a pivotal role in photocatalytic coproduction of H2 and benzaldehyde. The presence of Pd on HNb3O8 facilitates the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and affords the active sites for proton reduction and H2 evolution. Secondly, for the different Pd-modified HNb3O8 photocatalysts, Pd/HNb3O8-H2 has the highest activity for photocatalytic coproduction of H2 and benzaldehyde, followed by Pd/HNb3O8-N2 and Pd/HNb3O8-air, which should be attributed to the abundant VOs in Pd/HNb3O8-H2 generated during the thermal H2 reduction. Therefore, the construction of Pd-VO dual active sites on HNb3O8 is indispensable for improving the photocatalytic activity toward photocatalytic coproduction of H2 and benzaldehyde. The above results demonstrate that the thermal treatment of Pd2+/HNb3O8 in H2/Ar mixed gas is pivotal to the formation of Pd-VO dual active sites on HNb3O8 and thus has a distinct influence on the photocatalytic activity. Therefore, the variation in the photocatalytic activity of Pd/HNb3O8-H2 along with the duration of thermal treatment in H2/Ar mixed gas was studied and the results are displayed in Fig. 5d. All the Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalysts obtained with different H2 reduction times (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 h) exhibit the improved activity, compared with the other photocatalysts. The activity of Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst increases with prolonging the reduction time from 0.5 to 1.0 h, due to the generation of more Pd-VO dual active sites on HNb3O8. The Pd/HNb3O8-H2 catalysts obtained at 1.0 and 2.0 h of H2 reduction exhibit the similar photocatalysis. However, further prolonging the reduction time to 3.0 h results in a declination in the photocatalytic activity, possibly because the formation of larger Pd NPs is unfavorable for the photocatalytic reaction. In addition, the performance of the Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalysts obtained at different reduction temperatures (200, 300 and 400 °C) was tested, as listed in Table S3 (Supporting Information). Compared with the Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst obtained at 300 °C, the one obtained at a lower reduction temperature (200 °C) has inferior activity for the production of benzaldehyde probably because the insufficient generation of VOs on HNb3O8 reduces the affinity to benzyl alcohol. The higher reduction temperature (400 °C) also causes a declination in the photocatalytic activity due to the formation of larger Pd NPs on HNb3O8. As a consequence, the optimal coexistence of Pd nanoclusters and VOs on HNb3O8 obtained by the controlled H2 reduction at 300 °C for 1.0 h creates the best performance for photocatalytic coproduction of H2 and benzaldehyde. Furthermore, the different M/HNb3O8-H2 (M = Ni, Au, Pd, Pt) photocatalysts were prepared by the same impregnation–reduction procedure and their photocatalytic performance toward the coproduction of H2 and benzaldehyde was tested, as shown in Fig. 5e, Fig. S7d and Table S4 (Supporting Information). By comparison, the activities of the M/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalysts with different metals follow the sequence of Ni/HNb3O8-H2 < Au/HNb3O8-H2 < Pd/HNb3O8-H2 < Pt/HNb3O8-H2. Although the Pt/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst exhibits a little higher activity than that of the Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst, the utilization of Pt as active sites will lead to the great increase in the cost of the photocatalyst. Therefore, Pd is chosen as a cocatalyst anchored on defective HNb3O8 to develop the photocatalyst with high performance and low cost. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of the optimal Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst was measured to be 1.55 % in the coproduction of H2 and benzaldehyde under the irradiation of 365 nm from the Xe lamp. The Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst was further used in the photocatalytic coproduction of H2 and other aromatic aldehydes from the aqueous solution of different substituted benzyl alcohols. The results (Fig. 6 a and Table S5) demonstrate that the production rates of H2 and aldehydes vary greatly for the different substituted benzyl alcohols while the product selectivity always stays very high. Under the same conditions, p-methoxybenzyl alcohol exhibits the far higher reactivity than benzyl alcohol and other counterparts with electron-withdrawing para substituents (–F, –Cl). Specifically, the production rates of H2 and p-anisaldehyde reach up to 6.15 and 5.41 mmol·gcat −1 h−1, respectively, in the aqueous solution of p-methoxybenzyl alcohol with Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst. The different production rates of H2 and aldehydes can be ascribed to the differences in electronic effects of substituent groups. Groups that donate electrons to benzene ring can improve the reactivity of the aromatic alcohols while the ones that withdraw electrons from benzene ring have the opposite effect [19]. The recyclability of Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst was evaluated by the photocatalytic coproduction of H2 and benzaldehyde from benzyl-alcohol aqueous solution, with 5 h for each cycle. As shown in Fig. 6b and Table S6, the yields of H2 and benzaldehyde are little decreased during four photocatalytic cycles, indicating the highly stable activity and selectivity of Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst in the long period reaction. Moreover, the microstructures and surface chemical states of the recycled Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst are almost unchanged after the photocatalytic cycles, as revealed by XRD, TEM and XPS analyses (Figs. 6c-d; Fig. S8, Supporting Information), confirming the high stability of the photocatalyst."
12,Investigation on photocatalytic mechanism,"3.4 Investigation on photocatalytic mechanism To understand the photocatalytic mechanism for the coproduction of H2 and benzaldehyde from benzyl-alcohol (BA) aqueous solution, the influencing factors in the present photocatalytic reaction were firstly studied by a series of experiments with varying the reactants or their dosages (Fig. 7 a and Table S7), in the presence of Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst. In the aqueous solution without aromatic alcohol or other sacrificial agents (50 mL H2O), no benzaldehyde was produced and the photocatalytic H2 production is very sluggish (0.57 mmol·gcat −1 h−1). The addition of triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial agent (50 mL H2O + 0.64 mL TEOA) improves the H2 evolution a little (0.80 mmol·gcat −1 h−1) but it still far lower than that from the system of 0.5 mL benzyl alcohol in aqueous solution (50 mL H2O + 0.5 mL BA), manifesting the superiority of benzyl alcohol in promoting photocatalytic H2 production. Additionally, the photocatalytic reaction conducted in the solution of benzyl alcohol and benzotrifluoride without H2O (50 mL BTF +0.5 mL BA) presents the decreased production rates of H2 (1.72 mmol·gcat −1 h−1) and benzaldehyde (1.62 mmol·gcat −1 h−1), suggesting the pivotal role of H2O in accelerating the photocatalytic coproduction of H2 and benzaldehyde. Therefore, the coexistence of benzyl alcohol and H2O can result in a mutual promotion in the photocatalytic coproduction of H2 and benzaldehyde from water splitting coupled with selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Then, the radical intermediates produced in the photocatalytic reaction with Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst were determined by EPR measurement using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin-trapping regent. Two photocatalytic systems without and with benzyl alcohol are detected, respectively, as shown in Figs. 7b-c. No radical signal appears in dark. Upon irradiation, the system without benzyl alcohol presents the EPR signal featured with 1:2:2:1 quartet peaks assignable to the DMPO-trapped hydroxyl radical (DMPO-∙OH), as shown in Fig. 7b, suggesting that ·OH radical can be generated from the OH-/H2O oxidation on Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst. In contrast, the system with benzyl alcohol shows the signal with sextet peaks attributable to the DMPO-trapped carbon-centered radical (Fig. 7c), confirming the generation of carbon-centered radical occurs via the h+-driven oxidation of benzyl alcohol [13], which is generally identified as a crucial intermediate in photocatalytic selective benzyl-alcohol oxidation [51,52]. To gain further information on the superior photocatalysis of Pd/HNb3O8-H2, the photoinduced electrons trapped at active sites on different photocatalysts were determined quantitatively by an electron titration method, with thionine acetate salt as electron acceptor [38,53]. Thionine existing as a monovalent cation can be readily reduced to its colorless form (TH2−) via a two-step reduction, where the consumption of thionine corresponds to the amount of electrons trapped at active sites on the photocatalyst. According to the evolutions in UV–vis absorption spectra of thionine solution (Fig. S9, Supporting Information), the consumed amount of thionine increases gradually along with the prolonged irradiation time on photocatalysts (Fig. 7d). The consumed amounts of thionine over pristine HNb3O8 and HNb3O8-H2 at different irradiation times are very low. In contrast, a remarkable amount of thionine was consumed over the Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst, indicating that a larger amount of electrons are trapped at active sites of this photocatalyst. As shown in Fig.7e, the photoinduced electron densities on different photocatalysts evaluated from the consumption of thionine follows the order of Pd/HNb3O8-H2 (5.50 μmol gcat -1) > HNb3O8-H2 (1.44 μmol gcat -1) > HNb3O8 (0.48 μmol gcat -1). The results further verify that the Pd modified defective HNb3O8 photocatalyst possesses more electron-rich active sites which would be highly conducive to accelerating H2 production during the photocatalytic reaction. Furthermore, the electrochemical hydrogen evolution measurement (Fig. 7f) shows the more positive onset potential of Pd/HNb3O8-H2 catalyst than those of HNb3O8-H2 and pristine HNb3O8, confirming the higher activity of Pd/HNb3O8-H2 for hydrogen evolution. Furthermore, DFT calculation was conducted on the adsorption behaviors of H2O and benzyl alcohol on HNb3O8(001) surface with VO, without and with Pd loading (denote as HNb3O8(001)-VO and Pd/HNb3O8(001)-VO), respectively. The optimal configurations and the corresponding adsorption energies (E ad) are shown in Fig. 8 a. In comparison, the Pd/HNb3O8(001)-VO surface affords the stronger interactions with H2O and benzyl alcohol than HNb3O8(001)-VO. The adsorption of H2O molecule on the VO site of Pd/HNb3O8(001)-VO surface provides the most negative adsorption energy of −2.68 eV, accompanied by the splitting of H2O molecule. Notably, when the H2O molecule is adsorbed at the VO site of Pd/HNb3O8(001)-VO surface, one of the H atom from H2O is bonded to the adjacent O atom of HNb3O8(001) surface, leaving the −OH stabilized at the VO site, which is beneficial to generating the ·OH radical adsorbed on the photocatalyst. The previous study has demonstrated that the ·OH radicals adsorbed on catalyst surface are more suitable for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde than the free ·OH radicals in solution [10]. Moreover, the VO site of Pd/HNb3O8(001)-VO surface also has the stronger interaction with benzyl alcohol molecule (E ad =−3.77 eV). When the O atom in the −OH group of benzyl alcohol is adsorbed at the VO site of Pd/HNb3O8(001)-VO surface, the H atom in the −OH group is bonded to the adjacent O atom of HNb3O8(001) surface, which will facilitate the activation and selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol on the hole (h+)-rich HNb3O8 [19]. Fig. 8b shows the difference charge densities of H2O and benzyl alcohol adsorbed on HNb3O8 (001)-VO and Pd/HNb3O8 (001)-VO, respectively, which further elucidate the stronger interactions between the adsorbed molecules and the Pd/HNb3O8 (001)-VO surface. Based on the experimental and theoretical studies, we proposed a possible mechanism for the photocatalytic coproduction of H2 and benzaldehyde on the Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst in benzyl-alcohol aqueous solution, as illustrated in Figs. 9 and S10 (Supporting Information). Both benzyl alcohol and H2O molecules are first adsorbed on the surface VO sites of Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst and afford the protons. Upon the photoexcitation, electrons (e−) and holes (h+) are generated from HNb3O8 and separated by the Pd/HNb3O8 interface. The electrons are accumulated on Pd sites and the holes migrate to the surface of HNb3O8. Therefore, the H2 evolution from the reduction of protons is achieved on the Pd surface while the adsorbed benzyl-alcohol molecules are converted into carbon-centered radicals by the holes on HNb3O8. The carbon-centered radicals then combine with the ·OH radicals generated by the oxidation of hydroxyl adsorbed on HNb3O8, releasing benzaldehyde and H2O molecules. The Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst not only enhances the separation efficiency of photo-generated electrons and holes, but also affords the efficient dual active sites of Pd and VO for proton reduction and benzyl-alcohol oxidation. Therefore, the Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst exhibits superior performance for coproduction of H2 and benzaldehyde."
13,Conclusion,"In summary, the Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst with dual active sites has been synthesized by constructing Pd and VO sites on the surface of HNb3O8 via an impregnation–reduction procedure. The presence of Pd on HNb3O8 facilitates the generation of VOs on HNb3O8 during the thermal H2 reduction because of the reduced formation energy of VOs as well as the hydrogen spillover effect on Pd/HNb3O8. The spectroscopic and photoelectrochemical studies demonstrated the superior ability of the Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst for photoinduced charge separation and migration. For the photocatalytic proton reduction coupled with selective benzyl-alcohol oxidation, the Pd/HNb3O8-H2 photocatalyst exhibited the optimal production rates of H2 and benzaldehyde to be 3.17 and 2.76 mmol·gcat −1 h−1, respectively, which are greatly higher than those from HNb3O8-H2 only containing VOs and other counterparts. The experimental and theoretical studies have verified the synergistic effect of Pd and VO dual active sites in promoting the photocatalytic reaction. Theoretical calculations indicated that the coexistence of Pd and VO on HNb3O8 surface favored the adsorption and activation of H2O and benzyl alcohol. In consequence, the Pd modified defective HNb3O8 photocatalyst could enhance the separation efficiency of photo-generated electrons and holes as well as afford the efficient dual active sites of Pd and VO for proton reduction and benzyl-alcohol oxidation. This work provides a profound insight into the synergistic enhancement of hydrogen production coupled with selective oxidation benzyl alcohol by the designed photocatalyst with dual active sites, and affords an effective strategy to clean energy production and high value-added products."
