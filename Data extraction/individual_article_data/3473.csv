0,Introduction,"Recently, polymer nano-composite materials have been attracting attention due to their underlying applications. In fact, polymer nano-composite materials are the combination between the polymer matrix and in-organic nano-particles by physical blending or chemical polymerizing technologies to produce a new generation of materials having fingerprint properties that distinguish it. These new generation materials have superior physical properties such as optical, electrical, mechanical, electronic properties and others [1–5]. However, these materials have great problems limiting their use in the industrial applications. For instance, the poor dispersion of nano-particles in the polymer matrix due to the ineffective methods that used in the nano-composite preparation. Also, the problems of agglomeration and aggregation of nano-particles limit the advantage of their size-dependent property, thus hindering the large-scale production and commercialization of the nano-composites. In addition, the poor structure of the polymer nano-composites is another problem affecting the chemical and physical properties of nano-composites, hence making them less applicable [6]. Therefore, it is of great interest to study different classes of polymer nano-composite based on different concentrations of the nano-fillers. Among all nano-fillers, currently, metal oxides nano-structures have appeared as special and important nano-materials thanks to their unique properties (optical, electronic, spin and so on.) that are enhanced by the quantum confinement effects [1–5]. Metal oxides structures like (ZnO, MgO, etc.) have been studied for optical, electrical and other applications [7–10]. Zinc oxide as a metal oxide compound has many favorable properties such as high electron mobility, wide band gap, strong room temperature luminescence, etc. [11]. Also, ZnO nano-particles are inserted in many industrial areas and applications such as solar energy, light- emitting devices, gas sensors, photo-catalysts, pharmaceutical, cosmetic industries and optical limiting applications [12]. On the other hand, Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is the polymer that has unique properties and promising functional applications due to its easy preparation, atmospheric stability, low price, optical transparency, good charge storage capacity, very high dielectric strength (>1000 kV/mm), dopant dependent electrical, mechanical and optical properties [1–5]. In fact, PVA polymer has the ability to alter its structure and optical properties once it is doped with zinc oxide, according to the most current researches. A large number of literatures have been reporting in zinc oxide (ZnO) nano-particles doped PVA polymer for enhancing the optical properties of the nano-composite due to the higher optical properties of ZnO such as higher absorption in UV spectrum and high PL spectra [13,14]. For example, Mansour et al. [15] reported the improvement of structural and optical properties of PVA/ZnO nano-composites. Bouropoulos et al. [16] also studied the optical and dielectric properties of PVA/ZnO nano-composites. The optical properties of the nano-composites based on PVA with zero-dimensional ZnO quantum dots have been reported also [17]. Also, Thankappan et al. [18] reported on the effect of the shape on the optical limiting applications of the PVA/ZnO nanocomposite. However, the need for new materials with high optical limiting quality is essential. So, it is useful to explore the optical limiting properties of the nano-composites that are based on nano-fillers. Inspired by these studies, we are interested in metal peroxide structures such as (ZnO2, MgO2, etc.), which have two oxygen atoms that are linked by a single bond in their structure. Recently, Zinc peroxide (ZnO2) structures were synthesized by various methods like laser ablation, co-precipitation, hydrothermal, organometallic precursor method and photo-chemical reaction methods [19]. ZnO2 particles have many applications in oral surgeries, wear resistance, cosmetic, and so forth [20]. However, zinc peroxide (ZnO2) in nano-scale doped polyvinyl alcohol has not yet reported in any literatures until now and their optical limiting features. In fact, the progress of optical limiting materials with good characteristics such as being flexible, broadband and their low-cost becomes essential for protecting the eye and instruments from damage by the action of dense light. The importance of optical limiters is coming from these limiters having the ability to dimension the power density of laser.The optical materials with limiting features are used to guard the eyes and optical devices from the destruction produced by laser. Many literatures were introduced for the optical limiting applications. For instance, Jiang et al. [21] reported on the PVA/graphene oxide nano-composites for the optical limiting application. Sreeja et al. [22] also reported on the PVA/Light Green dye as an efficient optical limiter. In this paper, we introduce a new nano-composite based on PVA and ZnO2 synthesized by casting technique for promising optical applications. Here, we select PVA as a capping agent, stabilizing agent and a host material due to its durability, its ease of preparation, water solubility, and high optical transparency. On the other hand, ZnO2 particles were selected due to their excess of oxygen features, which facilitates the interaction with PVA polymer to improve the structure and optical properties. ZnO2 nano-particles were synthesized by using a microwave assisted hydrothermal technique then inserted in PVA polymer. It was found that the crystallinity of PVA/ZnO2 nano-composite increases with increasing the ZnO2 concentration in the nano-composite due to the growth of the intra and inter-molecular hydrogen bonding in the nano-composite. Furthermore, the optical properties of the said nano-composite were extensively studied. It was found that the optical absorption of the said films was tunable by changing the concentration of ZnO2 nano-particles. Also, the refractive index increases with the concentration of ZnO2 nano-particles and it was found to be 2.18 at 2 wt.% of ZnO2. PL spectra of the PVA/ZnO2 nano-composites showed only one peak at 450 nm, and the results confirmed tunable PL spectra for ZnO2 nano-particle concentration. Embedding of small concentrations (0.25–2 wt.%) of ZnO2 nanoparticles into PVA increased the Young's modulus from 2.40 ± 0.25 × 108 Pa for green PVA to 1.15 ± 0.03 × 109 Pa for 2 wt.% of ZnO2. Also, the tensile strength increased from 1.5 ± 0.05 × 107 Pa for green PVA to 1.1 ± 0.03 × 108 for 2 wt.% of ZnO2, while the elongation at break decreased with increasing the ZnO2 concentration. Also, Z-scan technique was applied to study the nonlinear (NL) optical features of the nanocomposites and it was shown a reverse saturable absorption, which creates it valuable materials for optical limiting applications. Finally, the films of PVA/ZnO2 nano-composite are expected to find promising potential applications in anti-ultraviolet, photo-anode in high-efficiency dye-sensitized solar cells, photonic devices, LED technology, lasers, optoelectronic, field-emission devices, sensing chemicals and optical limiting applications."
1,Experimental details,"PVA (M w = 17 × 103 g/mole, 99.8 % purity) was obtained from the Sigma–Aldrich Chemicals, Zinc acetate dehydrate (Mw = 142.394 g/mol, 99.9 % purity), Hydrogen peroxide (Mw = 34.01 g/mol, 99.8 % purity), absolute ethanol (CH3CH2OH, 99.5 % purity) and Sodium hydroxide (99.9 % purity) were purchased from (Adwic, El-Nasr Chemical Co., Cairo, Egypt)."
2,Synthesis of (PVA/ZnO2) nano-composite films,"2.1 Synthesis of (PVA/ZnO2) nano-composite films ZnO2 nano-particles were engineered by using the microwave assisted hydrothermal technique [1–5,9,23–31] (see supplementary materials). The green PVA films (PZn0) was engineered by using the solution casting technique [1–5,9,23–31]. For mention, the term ‘’green’’ refers to the ‘’clean or pure’’ PVA. The nano-composite (PVA/ZnO2) films were engineered by using the solution casting technique [1–5,9,23–31]. PVA with weight 2 g was dispersed in 50 mL of the triple-distilled water under vigorous stirring for 2 h at 65 ± 3 °C until a part of water evaporated and the solution turns to a clear viscous solution. Also, 0.25 wt.% of ZnO2 was dispersed in triple-distilled water. Under the hot conditions (65 ± 3 °C), ZnO2 solution was added to PVA viscous solution with a rate one drop/second with the mechanical stirring to obtain the well distribution of ZnO2 in the matrix of PVA. The solution was poured and then left to dry in an air conditions for an average 3 days in a room temperature, see scheme 1 . Then, the obtained films were labeled PZn0, PZn1, PZn2, PZn3 and PZn4 according to ZnO2 concentrations 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 wt.%, respectively. The thickness of the obtained PVA/ZnO2 films was found 212 ± 0.2 μm by using a digital caliper."
3,Instruments and method,"2.2 Instruments and method XRD patterns for the said films have been recorded by using the X-ray Diffractometer (Model: Brucker Axs-D8 Advance powder). TEM microscope was used to determine the size of the as synthesized ZnO2 nano-particles by taking a drop from the as synthesized ZnO2 solution into carbon-coated copper grid. Also, TEM image was performed for the film by using ultra-microtome technique. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) Model, (JEOL-JEM-1230) operated at 80−100 kV has been used. The surface morphology of the (PVA/ZnO2) films were performed by using, JEOL JSM- 6500 F, SEM microscope at 20 KV. A double beam UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer (JASCO V-570) was used to record the optical spectra, absorption (A) and transmission (T), of PVA/ZnO2 nano-composites as a function of wavelength λ (nm) in the range from 190 to 800 nm. A digital refractometer, with 4 digits accuracy and model Reichert Abbe refractometer mark II, was used to obtain the refractive index for green PVA and the engineered nano-composite PVA/ZnO2 films. A drop of alpha-bromonaphthaline was put onto the surface of the refracting prism at the illuminator end and the films were contacted with the liquid (located on the contact liquid) and closed the apparatus with a slight pressure to assure that the bubbles of air between the prism and the films are freed. The refractive indices of the said films were evaluated by adjusting the cross-hair with the shadow line. A JASCO FP 6300 spectrofluorometer was used to study the Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of PVA/ZnO2 films at λexcitation = 350 nm. The mechanical parameters of the films (dimensions: 20 × 2 × 0.21 mm) were measured by using a mechanical test apparatus (AMETEK) attached to a force gauge (0.01 N resolution, Hunter spring Accu force II). Z-scan technique [18] was used to study the optical nonlinear NL behavior and the optical limiting features of the nanocomposites by using a light source (Nd:YAG laser, 10 Hz of a rate of repetition, 7 ns is the width of a pulse, λ = 532 nm) and its model is (Spectra Physics LAB-1760). Rj7620, Laser Probe Corp energy ratio-meter was used to measure the transmitted and reference energies and also their ratio. This ratio-meter has attached with two pyro-electric sensor (Rjp735). A 35.4 μm was the beam waist radius ωo. A 7.4 mm was the Rayleigh thickness, which is much larger than the sample thickness. A 20 cm was the focal length of the converging lens. The calibration was done by using a 1 mm thick cuvette which is filled with a reference liquid. By fitting the experimental Z scan data we are able to get the NL coefficients. The optical limiting features were obtained from the Z-scan results. The experiments were repeated to avoid the permanent photo-induced change."
4,Results and discussion,
5,X-Ray diffraction and TEM study,"3.1 X-Ray diffraction and TEM study The X-ray patterns for green PVA and the engineered nano-composite PVA/ZnO2 films are depicted in Fig. 1 . As seen, only one peak with a weak intensity and a broad width was detected at 2θ = 19.5° for green PVA film (sample PZn0), due to the regular and arranged chains (lamella) in crystalline regions of the semi-crystalline PVA structure. The lamella of PVA produced from the strong molecular hydrogen bonding (inter/intra types) between the chains of PVA [2–5,23–31]. As seen, the intensity of the crystallinity peak increased with the growth of the concentrations of ZnO2 nano-particles in the nano-composite. The increase in the crystallinity is attributed to the increase in the hydrogen bonding numbers between ZnO2 and PVA segments (see Scheme 1). This is produced by the strong interaction between ZnO2 nano-particles and the (OH group) in PVA polymer, which produces a molecular rearrangement and a local ordering within the amorphous chains of PVA. The presence of ZnO2 in the matrix of PVA will fill and occupy the interstitial sites in the amorphous phases of PVA chains. This aids to link the amorphous and the crystalline regions with each other via the hydrogen bonding due to charge transport processes, the molecular chains of the polymer are regularly folded, and hence increase the crystallinity [4,9]. The degree of crystallinity was calculated by using the integrated area under the crystalline regions divided by the integrated area under the complete XRD trace [23–31] and it was found to be 28.10 %, 33.52 %, 38.60 %, 40.91 % and 44.31 % for 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 wt.%, respectively. In addition to this peak, there are four XRD peaks at 2θ = 31.5°, 36.6°, 53.2° and 63.2° for the (hkl) planes (111), (200), (220), and (311), which characterize the cubic structure of ZnO2, according to (JCPDS Card No. 13-0311, space group of P a 3 - , ZnO2) [32]. The lattice parameter of ZnO2 was calculated and it was found to be 4.862(1) Å. Also, the crystal size of ZnO2 nano-particles was calculated from the Scherer’s equation [1,3–5,23–31] and it was found to be 55 ± 2 nm. TEM microscope was used to investigate the particles size and shape of the as-prepared ZnO2 nano-particles, as shown in Fig. 2 (a). As seen from the TEM image, there are tiny isolated particles within the nano-scale and uniform spherical and other shapes. From the histogram plot, it can be seen that the size distribution ranging from 30 to 60 nm and the average size was about 40 nm (inset of Fig. 2a). Also, Fig. 2(b) shows the TEM image of a thin layer of PVA/ZnO2 nano-composite films. As seen, ZnO2 nano-particles are arranged in a uniform distribution in the matrix of the nano-composite and from the histogram plot the average particle size is 50 nm (inset of Fig. 2b). The variance in the average particle size between the as-prepared ZnO2 nano-particles and their size in nano-composites can be explained according to the Ostwald ripening theory [5]. In fact, the polarity of the solution affects the agglomeration and Ostwald ripening process of the nano-particles. In the experiment, water is a solvent which has a great solvent polarity and the solution was left for an average 3 days to evaporate at room temperature. During the evaporation time, residual water causes a series of agglomeration by the Ostwald ripening theory [5,6]. On the other hand, SEM images of the PVA/ZnO2 nanocomposites (Fig. 2c-f). As seen, for the green PVA, the film has a smooth, clean and regular surface (Fig. 2c). However, the surface still clean, smooth and regular when the film doping with 0.5 wt.% of ZnO2 nanoparticles, which indicates to the good compatibility between the PVA and ZnO2 nanoparticles and the ZnO2 are well distributed in the PVA matrix (Fig. 2d). But there are some aggregation and agglomeration, spherical particles on the surface, were observed when increasing the concentration of the ZnO2, ( Fig. 2e,f). These aggregation and agglomeration may be created during the films fabrication due to the strong hydrogen bonding between the PVA and ZnO2 [5]. This leads to scatter a large amount of light, which are likely to produce opaqueness in the films and low transparency, due to the large cross-section of light scattering."
6,Optical properties,"3.2 Optical properties 3.2.1 Absorption spectra The optical absorption spectra for green PVA and the engineered nano-composite PVA/ZnO2 films as a function of λ = 190−800 nm are depicted in Fig. 3 (a). At first, we discuss the optical behavior of the green PVA. In UV region (λ = 190−350 nm), the figure shows three absorption bands located at the wavelengths 200 nm, 275 nm, and 325 nm. These bands are related to the existence of the carbonyl groups of the types − CH = CH n − C = O [9] where n = 1, 2, 3 for the three absorption bands 200 nm, 275 nm, and 325 nm, respectively [9]. These carbonyl groups arise from the presence of acetaldehyde in the vinyl acetate monomer during the polymerization process of the polyvinyl acetate to produce the polyvinyl alcohol [33]. All the absorption bands can be illustrated according to the simple internal structural scheme of PVA. Actually, the absorption band at 200 nm used to estimate the concentration of the − CH = CH − CO structures, while the absorption band at 275 nm used to estimate the concentration of the − CH = CH 2 − CO − structures and the absorption band at 325 nm used to estimate the concentration of the − CH = CH 3 − CO − structures, and visce-versa [33]. But in the visible region, no absorption bands were detected because of the transparent nature of PVA polymer. But for PVA/ZnO2 nano-composite, the intensity of the peak 200 and 275 nm increases, while the intensity of the peak at 325 nm decreases, disappeared and twinned with the peaks 200 nm and 275 nm with increasing the concentration of ZnO2 nano-particles in PVA matrix. This behavior is illustrated according to the following chemical reaction, Eq. (1). (1) C H 2 C H O H → C H 2 C H * + O H * The increase in the two peaks 200 nm and 275 nm are attributed to the increase of ZnO2 nano-particles concentration, which leads to an increase in the number of free radicals (CH2CH*) and negative hydroxyl groups (OH−) in PVA matrix. This leads to the increase in the number of carbonyl groups of the structural types − CH = CH n − C = O , where n = 1. In fact, the carbonyl group of the structure type of (n = 1) produced due to the elimination of the hydroxyl group from the vinyl monomer. According to Eq. (1) when one pair of this vinyl monomer radical reacts with each other, this creates the carbonyl structure of the type n = 1, which leads to the increase in the absorption band at 200 nm (see Eqs. 2 and 3). Also, when two pairs of the active free radicals of the vinyl monomer react together, they will create the carbonyl group of the structural type n = 2, which leads to the increase in the absorption band at 275 nm, see Eqs. (2 and 3). (2) C H 2 C H • + • CHC H 2 → C H 2 − CH = CH − C H 2 (3) − C H 2 − CH = CH − C H 2 + C = O → − CH = CH − C = O + − C H 2 − C H 2 − But the decrease in the intensity of the absorption band at 325 nm can be illustrated according to Eq. (1) as follow: (i) the formation of hydrogen bonding between ZnO2 nano-particles and negative hydroxyl group leads to decreasing the probability of interaction between three pairs of the free radicals because of the very short lifetime of ions (ii) These ions producing in the nanocomposites (like, OH−) act to break the carbonyl group of the type structure n = 3 and change it to carbonyl group of the structure type n = 1,2 and produce a broad and twinned absorption band that observed at higher ZnO2 concentration. Also, the presence of ZnO2 nano-particles act to form bridges between the polymer chains beside the hydrogen bonds which essentially exist, and consequently, increase the intermolecular and intramolecular interactions in the polymer matrix, and produce a slight shift in the position of these peaks to longer wavelength by solvation denoted on the transition type n-π*. On the other hand, the absorption spectra in the visible region show increase in the intensity with increasing the ZnO2 concentration. Fig. 3(b) shows that the intensity of the absorption at 500 nm increases with increasing the concentration ZnO2 nano-particles in the matrix of PVA. This increase in the absorption intensity is due to the increase in the concentration of the absorbing particles (ZnO2 nano-particles) in the matrix of PVA according to the Beer-Lambert law [1–5,9,23–31]. For more discussion, the absorption spectrum of ZnO2 nanoparticles was measured (Fig S1). 3.2.2 Band gap Based on the absorption spectra, it can calculate the optical parameters of PVA/ZnO2 nano-composites such as the absorption coefficient α(λ) and the energy gap (Eg). Fig. 4 shows the absorption coefficient of the green PVA and PVA/ZnO2 films as a function of the photon energy. The absorption coefficient α(λ) was determined from the relation α = 2.303 A d , where A is the absorbance and d is the thickness of the obtained films [9,24,31]. From the figure, the absorption coefficient α(λ) of the green PVA sample shows no change with photon energy up to a critical energy (Ec = 3.6 eV). Then after a critical energy 3.6 eV the absorption coefficient increases by increasing the incident photon energy. This observed behavior can be explained as follow; in the higher wavelength range/lower energy (hν < 3.6 eV), absorption is attributed to electronic transitions from the bonding molecular orbital to non-bonding one. And the energy is not sufficient enough to excite and transfer many electrons between the molecular orbitals. But in the lower wavelength range/higher energy (hν < 3.6 eV), the incident photon energy is sufficient enough to excite and transfer many electrons causing more and more electronic transitions from the bonding and non-bonding molecular orbital to the anti-bonding one producing an increase in the absorption coefficient. On the other hand, the absorption coefficient of PVA/ZnO2 nano-composite shows a trend completely different from that of the green PVA polymer. The absorption coefficient increases in the lower energy range by increasing the ZnO2 nano-particles in the nano-composite. Also, the critical energy (Ec) is shifted to lower energy. In addition, the absorption coefficient shows saturation in the higher energy range by increasing the concentration of ZnO2 nano-particles. This behavior was observed due to the presence of ZnO2 in the nano-composite and increasing their concentrations in the matrix introducing a large number of free carrier's density in the nano-composite. So, the increase in the photon energy produces more and more free carrier-density in the nano-composite, which needs small photon energy to be excited to higher energy orbitals and hence decreasing the penetration depth d* = 1/α and increasing the absorption coefficient. The shift in the positions of the critical energy (Ec) to lower photon energy by increasing ZnO2 concentration denoted on the transition from n-π* due to the increase in the intermolecular and intramolecular interactions between the chains and the atoms by increasing ZnO2 concentration. This proves that the impact of ZnO2 nano-particles on the nano-composite and its quality to minimize the energy that the nano-composite needs to excite its electron to the conduction band. To obtain the energy gaps of the engineered films, the term of (αhν)0.5 versus the photon energy (hν) is plotted in Fig. 5 . The plot indicates a linear behavior for the absorption near the fundamental absorption edge. The allowed indirect transition energies were determined by extrapolating the linear portion of the curves to zero absorption as shown in Fig. 5 and calculating the corresponding value of photon energy. For green PVA film, the indirect energy gap lies at 4.55 eV, while for 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 wt.% of the ZnO2 nano-particles-doped PVA films, the Eg = 4.12, 3.80, 3.16 and 2.80 eV, respectively. It is clear that, when the concentration of ZnO2 nano-particles increases, the energy gap decreases as shown in the figure. This decrease in the optical energy gap can be explained on the basis of the fact that the incorporation of ZnO2 dopant forms charge transfer complexes (CTCs) in host materials trap levels between HOMO and LUMO bands of PVA producing a dangling orbitals, increasing the band tails in the nano-composite and hence decreasing the band gaps [1–4,9,23–31]."
7,Transmission spectra,"The transmittance (T %) spectra for all the ﬁlms were examined as a function of wavelength, as shown in Fig. 6 . As observed, the transmission spectra show cut-off frequency behavior (zero transmission) from 190 nm to 450 nm with increasing ZnO2 nano-particles. This is due to the increase in ZnO2 concentration which leads to increase the intra and intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the poly (vinyl alcohol) matrix and ZnO2 nano-particles and thus increasing the crosslinking density in the nano-composite films [1,4]. So, the transmittance decreases in the UV region until reaching zero value. But in the visible region, it is clear that the transmittance of the green PVA is 86 % and the transmittance decreases to 32 % with 2 wt.% of ZnO2 nano-particles. This reduction in transmission is attributed to the increase in the concentration of ZnO2, which leads to increase in the density of ZnO2 nano-particles in PVA/ZnO2 nano-composite. Also, it is known that there is a significant and a large amount of scattering loss, by increasing the amount of the doping particles in the nano-composites. Therefore, according to the theory of the effective medium, the insertion of ZnO2 will decrease the transmittance spectra. This is attributed to the change in the packing density in the nano-composites during the addition of ZnO2 nano-particles in it, which leads to the change in the refractive index (n), and hence the transmission. It's known that the (n) depends on two parameters (i) the dielectric constants of the participating components and (ii) the hybrid nano-composites geometries. The refractive index (n) values can be calculated from the Equation: (4) n n a n o c o m p o s i t e s 2 = n P V A 2 × V % + n Z n O 2 2 ( 1 - V % ) This means that the transmittance spectra of the nano-composite films decrease when the refractive index (n) increases. It's known that the value of (n) for ZnO2 (n = 1.7) [34] and (n = 1.49–1.52) for PVA, it is expected that when ZnO2 is inserted into PVA polymer, this leads to enhancing the refractive index of the nano-composites. From this hypothesis, the increase in the density of ZnO2 nano-particle in PVA will increase the scattering loss and this lead to decreasing transparency of the films. Therefore, from the figure, it shows that the sample PZn4 exhibits low transmittance compared with the other samples PZn0, PZn1, PZn2 and PZn3. It's clear that the transmission decreases with increasing ZnO2 in the nano-composites. This behavior can be illustrated on the basis of the increase in the number and density of ZnO2 nano-particles in the nano-composites, and hence forming ZnO2 regions in the nano-composite with a large scattering of light, which are likely to produce opaqueness in the films and low transparency, due to the large cross-section of light scattering. This explanation was supported by the SEM analysis to study the surface morphology of the films Fig. 2(c–f)."
8,Refractive index,"From the previous discussion for the transmission spectra, it is observed that there is a strong relation between the refractive index and the transmittance. As seen before, the transmission spectra are strongly influenced by the concentration of ZnO2 nano-particles. This behavior attracted our attention to study and evaluate the refractive index values of PVA/ZnO2 nano-composite. The relation between the refractive index and the concentration of ZnO2 nano-particles is depicted in Fig. 7 . It can be seen that the (n) increases after doping ZnO2 in PVA polymer and this raise remains with the increase in the concentration of ZnO2 nano-particles. From the Eq. (4). n n a n o c o m p o s i t e s 2 = n P V A 2 × V % + n Z n O 2 2 1 - V % , the value of the refractive index can be predicted. From the above equation, the refractive index was increased only by increasing the concentration of PVA matrix or by increasing the amount or the concentration of ZnO2 nano-particles in the nano-composites. But in our research, the PVA concentration is constant and we change or increase the concentration of ZnO2. By increasing the concentration of ZnO2 nano-particles, it was found that the value of the refractive index increases. This increase in the refractive index of the said nano-composite films with increasing the concentration of ZnO2 is ascribed to the creation of intra-intermolecular bonding between ZnO2 nano-particles and the polyvinyl alcohol polymer [1–4]. As the concentration of ZnO2 increases, the number of inter-chain interactions is enhanced, producing a variation in the density of chains packing, the distribution of molecular weight etc., which increases the refractive index."
9,Photoluminescence (PL) spectra,"5.1 Photoluminescence (PL) spectra The PL spectra of PVA/ZnO2 films as a function of wavelength are depicted in Fig. 8 (a). As seen from the figure, the only one PL peak for PVA/ZnO2 films was observed at 450 nm. This peak arises from the fact that the functional hydroxyl groups (OH) of PVA sharing in the electron donation process from the (OH) group to ZnO2 depends on enhancing electron withdrawal [25]. This strong interaction between polyvinyl alcohol and ZnO2 nano-particles raises the primary HOMO to the orbital with a higher energy. Where, the (OH) groups increase the densities of the delocalized electron, producing a narrow and small optical band gap and this facilitates the process of transitions [25]. Also, it can be seen that the intensity of this peak increases with increasing the concentration of ZnO2 nano-particles in the PVA matrix, see Fig. 8(b). This can be explained on the basis of; when embedding ZnO2 atoms into the matrix of the polyvinyl alcohol polymer. This leads to the strong interaction between ZnO2 and PVA through the hydrogen bonding, which may increase the stability of the electron density of the molecular orbital. Thus, when the concentration of ZnO2 surges, the density of electrons becomes considerably stable which in turn increases the effective transitions number, therefore, the increase in the PL intensity [25]."
10,Optical limiting behavior,"5.2 Optical limiting behavior The open-aperture Z-scan technique was used to study the NL optical properties of the PVA/ZnO2 nanocomposite films (Fig. 9 ). Indeed, in the open-aperture condition, the normalized transmittance (Tnormalized ) is obtained from the Equation below [18]: (5) T = q - 1 ln 1 + q Where, (6) q = β I o L e f f / 1 + Z 2 / Z o 2 Where the effective thickness is represented by Leff, the nonlinear absorption coefficient is represented by β, the laser intensity is represented by I0, and α is the linear absorption coefficient. In fact, the effective thickness (Leff) is obtained from the Equation, (7) L e f f = 1 - e - α I / α The imaginary part of susceptibility can be calculated by using the obtained results of β, and its relation with β is given from the Equation, (8) I m χ ( 3 ) = n o 2 ε o C 2 λ β / 4 π Where ω, c, εo and no are the radiation angular frequency, the light velocity in vacuum, the free space permittivity and the linear refractive index of films, respectively. In fact, by using the spectra of reflection and transmission, the linear refractive index is calculated [21]. The calculated values of the imaginary part of susceptibility for the nanocomposites were tabulated in Table 1 . So that, in this study the intensity of the laser beam is at 532 nm matches with the process of the two-photon absorption since the hv = 2.33 eV of the 532 nm laser beam in the range 2 Eg < 2 hv < Eg,. As seen, a peak-valley was appeared from the Tnormalized open-aperture curve, showing the presence of reverse saturable absorption behavior. As seen, Tnormalized was studied with changing the position for the nanocomposite films at λ = 532 nm and power P = 539 MWcm−2 (Fig. 10 a–c). For mentioning, dots refer to the experimental data and solid lines refer to the theoretical fitting of Eq. (5). The values of β are calculated from the obtained fitting for the nanocomposites. Generally, the NL absorption can take place due to different mechanisms, like NL scattering, multi-photon absorption (two/three-photon absorption 2PA/3PA), excited state absorption, etc. [18,21]. However, the mechanism of absorption herein this study is the two-photon absorption being well-fitted with the experimental data. These results prove that 2PA is the main mechanism contributed in the process of NL absorption. Similar results were reported by Thankappan and his group [18], they reported that the 2PA is the main mechanism of the NL absorption for the nanocomposite (PVA/ZnO nanoplates and nanoflakes). Fig. 10d shows the NL absorption coefficient of the films at different intensities. As seen at 536 MW/cm2 power density of laser, the limiting response of the nanocomposites was studied and depicted in Fig. 10. Also, at 357 MW/cm2 input power density, the optical limiting threshold was presented in Table 1.. From the limiting response relation, the fluence value parallel to the onset of optical limiting for PZn1 is less than that of PZn4. As seen the NL response depends on the ZnO2 nanoparticles concentration plus the pump power. Also, with increasing ZnO2 concentration the NL efficiency increased exhibiting the reduction in the limiting threshold. The growth of ZnO2 concentration allows more NL interaction between the media and radiations."
11,Mechanical properties,"5.3 Mechanical properties The mechanical parameters were plotted versus the concentration of the ZnO2, Fig. 11 (a–d). The Young’s modulus and tensile strength were increased and the elongation at break was reduced with increasing the concentration of the ZnO2. This is maybe due to the increase in the cross-linking density in the nanocomposites [1–5,9,23–31]. This cross-linking density was increased when the ZnO2 concentration increased. The higher cross-linking density, the smaller possibility of orientation, the higher the strength, hence increases the stiffness of the polymer [1–5,9,23–31]. So, the increasing of the cross-linking leads to the increase in Young Modulus. Where the increase in the cross-linking density leads to increase the thermal stability of the nanocomposites and make them insoluble in an organic solvent property. Also, we observed the elongation reduces when the concentration of ZnO2 increases; see Fig. 11(d). The decrease in the strain/elongation or the plastic region may be attributed to (i) The increasing crosslinking density in the nano-composite films [4,5,9,25]. (ii) The decrease in the polymer chain unravel, and these chains aligning perpendicular to the direction of the applied stress causing the decrease in a plastic region [4,5,9,25]."
12,Conclusions,"In this paper, the nano-composite PVA/ZnO2 films were prepared by the casting technique for optical limiting applications. From the obtained results we can conclude that, TEM microscope confirms that ZnO2 nano-particles are in the nano-scale and their average size within 40−50 nm. XRD patterns prove the presence of ZnO2 nano-particles in the matrix of the PVA. In addition, the crystallinity of the nano-composites was increased with increasing ZnO2 nano-particles, due to increasing the molecular hydrogen bonding (intra and inter types) in the nano-composite and it was found to be 44.31 % at 2 wt.% of ZnO2. Also, it was observed that the optical properties of PVA/ZnO2 nano-composite films are strongly tuned with the concentration of ZnO2 in the films. The optical absorption spectra confirmed that the strong interaction between ZnO2 nano-particles and the OH groups in PVA. The transmission spectra showed a cut off UV–vis filter behavior in the band from 190−450 nm. Also, the refractive index increased with increasing the concentration of ZnO2 in PVA, and it was found that the highest value of the refractive index was 2.18 at 2 wt.% of ZnO2. PL spectra of PVA/ZnO2 composite showed only one peak at 450 nm and the results confirmed the tunable PL behaviors for ZnO2 inserted into the matrix of PVA. Also, the mechanical behavior was explored and it was found the Young's modulus was increased by one order by embedding 2 wt.% of ZnO2 nanoparticles. Also, Z-scan technique was applied to study the nonlinear optical features of the nanocomposites and it show a reverse saturable absorption, which makes them valuable materials for optical limiting applications. Finally, this work may open the horizons to a wide range of potential functional applications for anti-ultraviolet, optical window, photoanode in high-efficiency dye-sensitized solar cells, photonic devices, LED technology, laser filters, optoelectronic, field-emission devices, sensing chemicals and optical limiting devices based on ZnO2 composite."
