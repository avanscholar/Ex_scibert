0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is universally considered as one of the most promising alternatives to fossil fuels, for its high caloric value and efficient burning or use in fuel cells. Conventional physicochemical methods for hydrogen production are energy intensive and not always environmentally friendly. Biological hydrogen production is recognized as one of the prospective options for massive hydrogen production due to low production costs, less pollutant discharge and smaller energy consumption (Kotay and Das, 2008). Furthermore, these processes can use many organic substrates as carbon sources (Manish and Banerjee, 2008), so that they offer the dual function of waste biodegradation and hydrogen production (Chen et al., 2006). Bio-hydrogen can be produced from the dark fermentation of carbohydrate rich wastes, and photo-fermentation of organic acid-rich wastewaters. The photo-fermentation process is frequently used to produce hydrogen because of the high purity of the hydrogen produced, high theoretical substrate conversion efficiency, relatively small quantity of byproducts and no O2-evolving activity which causes O2 inactivation in green algae hydrogen production systems (Fascetti and Todini, 1995; Lee et al., 2002; Shi and Yu, 2005). The light absorption spectrum of PSB (400–950nm) is wider than that of green algae (400–700nm) (Akkerman et al., 2002), and PSB can produce hydrogen from the mineralization of organic acids such as acetic acid and butyric acid, which are predominant metabolites from dark fermentation in the hydrogen production processes. Previous work focused mainly on investigation of the effects of operating conditions such as illumination condition (Kim et al., 2006), type and concentration of substrate (Barbosa et al., 2001; Ren et al., 2008), initial cell density and pH (Kosourov et al., 2003, 2002) on hydrogen production of PSB in suspended or batched culture. Recently it has been generally acknowledged that the low hydrogen production rate of PSB, which is primarily attributed to low cell growth rate and inefficient light energy utilization (Chen et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 1999), is the major bottleneck in industrial application of the photo-fermentation process. Thus, research on improving the hydrogen production rate and light conversion efficiency of photobioreactor is attracting more extensive attention. It has been found that the former can be achieved by increasing biomass retention per unit volume of the reactor, and the latter is affected mainly by the structure of bioreactor and the light source that is used (Chen et al., 2006; Wakayama and Miyake, 2002). Generally, the immobilization processes of hydrogen-producing cultures should be an effective approach to increase biomass retention in bioreactors (Tian et al., 2009). Recent studies of immobilized-cell dark fermentation hydrogen production show that relatively high unit volumetric production rates are found in immobilized-cell anaerobic systems, as a consequence of increased biomass retention (Zhang et al., 2008). The hydrogen production rate of these immobilized-cell systems achieved peak values of 6.6l/l/h in a granular reactor (Zhang et al., 2008), 7.3l/l/h in a self-flocculated anaerobic granular reactor (Lee et al., 2004) and 1.01l/l/h in a thermal trickling biofilter (Oh et al., 2004). These immobilization technologies, based mainly on the granulation process or biofilm attachment process (Kim et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2008), are also the most popular techniques for hydrogen production because of their increased biomass retention and improved tolerance to inhibitors, compared with suspended-cell systems (Bagai and Madamwar, 1998; Chang and Lin, 2004; Kumar and Das, 2001; Wu et al., 2006). Unfortunately, those studies were focused mainly on dark fermentation, and only a few studies aimed at immobilized-cell technologies for photo-hydrogen production have been reported to date. Chen and Chang (2006) supplemented fermentation broth with clay and silica gel to investigate phototrophic hydrogen production, and found 67.2–50.9% and 37.2–32.5% increases in hydrogen production rate and yield. Fiβler et al. (1995) used immobilized cells of Rhodopseudomonas palustris in polymeric materials to obtain a doubled hydrogen production rate relative to that from liquid cultures. Zhu et al. (1999) entrapped anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria of Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides in cationic polymer/agar gels to prevent the inhibitory effect of NH 4 + and improve photo-hydrogen production. Tian et al. (2009) reported that immobilization of R. palustris in a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-boric acid gel granule could remarkably facilitate hydrogen production. Compared with granulation immobilization for photo-hydrogen fermentation systems, biofilm attachment technology avoids the limitation to light penetration resulting from the dense packing of immobilized PSB granules, enhancing hydrogen production because the efficiency of light energy utilization is crucial in the design of the photo-hydrogen fermentation bioreactor (Chen et al., 2006; Tsygankov et al., 1994). However, to our knowledge studies on photo-hydrogen fermentation bioreactors with biofilm attachment are very sparse except for the work of Tian et al. (2010) on immobilized cells of R. palustris on the surface of packed glass beads to form biofilm, and effects of various parameters on photo-hydrogen production performance. In the present study, biofilm of an indigenous purple non-sulfur photoheterotrophic bacterium, R. palustris CQK 01, was obtained using immobilization cell technology of surface adsorption on a cover glass slide under various illumination intensities and wavelengths. The objectives of the present study were to assess the effects of illumination on biofilm formation and structure, and then further investigate photo-hydrogen production performance for different biofilms in the photobioreactor under various illumination wavelengths and intensities, flow rates and substrate concentrations."
1,Methods,
2,Microorganism and cultivation,"2.1 Microorganism and cultivation An indigenous photosynthetic bacterium designated R. palustris CQK 01 for phototrophic hydrogen production was isolated from local municipal sewage sludge. The strain was grown in a synthetic medium consisting of (g/l) K2HPO4·3H2O, 1.0060; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.2000; KH2PO4, 0.5440; FeSO4·7H2O, 0.0417; (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 0.0010; NaCl, 0.2000; CaCl2, 0.0100; CO(NH2)2, 1.6770; ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.0010; yeast extract, 1.0000; C5H8NNaO4·H2O, 0.5000, growth factors solution (comprising biotin 1g/l, pyridoxine hydrochloride 1g/l, riboflavin 1g/l, thiamine hydrochloride 1g/l and nicotinic acid 1g/l), 1ml/l. For pre-culture, the carbon source was a glucose solution with initial concentration 9.9000g/l. The cells were anaerobically cultivated at 30°C under illumination from a light-emitting diode (LED) with illumination intensity approximately 4000lx. The initial pH of the medium prior to incubation was adjusted to 7.0 with 0.1M NaOH. Argon was used to create anaerobic atmosphere. Enriched photosynthetic bacteria were initially used as inoculums for start-up of the bioreactor."
3,Experimental setup and operation,"2.2 Experimental setup and operation The experimental apparatus, illustrated in Fig. 1 , consisted of a medium container, a peristaltic pump, a flat-panel photobioreactor, a liquid/biogas separator and a collection bottle. Two types of flat-panel photobioreactors were fabricated to satisfy the specific requirements of the biofilm formation experiments and the hydrogen production experiments. For the biofilm formation experiments the flat-panel bioreactor was made of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) with a cover glass slide (24mm×60mm×0.17mm), which offered a solid carrier surface for the adsorption and growth of bacteria to facilitate measurement of biofilm thickness, dry weight and microstructure. The flow cross-section and working volume of bioreactor were 18mm×10mm and 9000mm3, respectively. For the hydrogen production experiments, the cover glass slide of the flat-panel photobioreactor was enlarged to 72mm×100mm×3mm to increase hydrogen production rate so as to attain higher accuracy of measurement of hydrogen production. Correspondingly, the flow cross-section and the working volume of the flat-panel photobioreactor were increased to 72mm×10mm and 72,000mm3, respectively. A liquid distributor, composed of two perforated plates holding a packed bed of glass beads 4mm in diameter, was installed at the entrance of the bioreactor to maintain uniform flow distribution in the bioreactor. The liquid and biogas were drained from the effluent on the top side of the photobioreactor to facilitate eduction of the biogas that was produced. Silicone rubber hose was chosen for the supply pipes in the experimental system, and all bare surfaces of the photobioreactor and supply pipes, except the irradiation surface of photobioreactor, were covered with aluminum foil. The substrate medium solution was fed by peristaltic pump (BT01-YZ1515, China); the flow rate was adjusted by changing the pump speed. The temperature of the substrate medium solution in the photobioreactor was maintained at approximately 30°C during the experiments. An external light source was mounted above the cover glass slide of the photobioreactor. Four monochromatic LED lamps, emitting at 630, 590, 520 and 470nm were used as light sources, and the illumination intensity was adjusted from 1000 to 8000lx by varying the distance between the LED and the photobioreactor. To maintain anaerobic conditions, the photobioreactor and silicone hoses were filled with substrate solution and the top of the medium container was purged with argon. The experiments were conducted in two stages: the start-up stage and steady-state operation. During the start-up stage of the bioreactor, the medium was recycled to avoid loss of activated PSB cells in the circulated liquid. The PSB cells were immobilized on the cover glass slide to form biofilm under a range of illumination conditions, at specific influent substrate solution concentration and flow rate, to study the effect of illumination conditions on biofilm formation. About 250ml of substrate solution was replaced by fresh sterilized nutrient medium every 24h until steady-state operation was reached. The steady-state experiments were conducted in the open loop system where the biogas produced in the bioreactor was collected in the collection bottle by the water displacement method, to determine the hydrogen production rate. The hydrogen production rate of the bioreactor with a specific biofilm was measured under various illumination conditions, as well as influent substrate solution concentrations and flow rates, to study the effect of PSB biofilm formation and operation conditions on the hydrogen production performance."
4,Estimation of hydrogen production performance,"2.3 Estimation of hydrogen production performance The average H2 production rate, H2 yield and light conversion efficiency were used to assess the performance of the photobioreactor in continuous hydrogen production. The average H2 production rate and H2 yield are defined by Eqs. (1) and (2): (1) H 2 production rate = Amount of H 2 produced (mmol) H 2 evolution time (h) × irradiated area (m 2 ) , (2) H 2 yield = Amount of H 2 produced (mmol) Amount of substrate consumed ( mmol ) . The light conversion efficiency was defined as the efficiency of the conversion of light energy into hydrogen energy, and calculated by Eq. (3) following the literature (Chen et al., 2006; Miyake et al., 1987). (3) Light conversion efficiency = H 2 output (g) × H 2 energy content (J/g) light energy input (J) × 100 = 33.61 × ρ H 2 × V H 2 I × A × t × 100 where V H 2 is the volume of H2 produced (l), ρ H 2 is the density of the H2 produced (g/l), I the light intensity (W/m2), A the irradiated area (m2), and t is the duration of H2 production (h)."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The hydrogen content of the biogas produced by the bioreactor was determined with a gas chromatograph (SC-2000, Chongqing, China) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 2m stainless-steel column packed with porous styrene particles. Argon with flow rate 25ml/min was used as the carrier gas, and the temperatures of the GC oven and TCD were maintained at 55 and 100°C, respectively. The electric current for the TCD was 80mA. The glucose concentration in the effluent was determined by optical density measurement at 540nm wavelength using a UV–VIS spectrophotometer (756MC, Shanghai, China), by the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid method (after appropriate dilution with deionized water). The medium was weighed with an analytical balance (Sartorius BP114, Germany), and the pH measured with an Ecoscan-pH6 meter (Singapore). Light intensity and radiation measurements were carried out with a luxmeter (ST-85, Beijing, China) and a spectroradiometer (FZ-A, Xi’an, China), respectively. The morphology and microstructure of R. palustris CQK 01 biofilms formed under different illumination conditions were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (using a HITACHI S-3400N instrument). The samples were pretreated as follows. A sample of biofilm was extracted from the surface of the cover glass slide and fixed on the solid matrix by phosphate buffer saline (PBS) with 2.5% glutaraldehyde (pH 7.2–7.4). Metal impregnation was done by transferring the glutaraldehyde-fixed sample to OsO4 in the phosphate buffer, and then the sample was washed with the same buffer. The fixed samples were dehydrated stepwise with a graded series of ethanol solutions (30, 50, 70, 80, 90 and 100%), then critical-point dried with tert-butyl ethanol and sputter coated with a thin layer of gold. The biofilm was observed in high vacuum using SEM in the secondary electron imaging mode. The dry weight of biofilm was measured using the following procedure. Mature biofilm adhering to the cover glass slide was washed gently with distilled water to eliminate non-fixed biomass then dried at 105°C to constant weight. The dry weight of biofilm was evaluated as the difference between the weight of the cover glass slide with dry cells and the weight of the bare cover glass slide. An optical microscope with micrometer was employed to measure the biofilm thickness as the average of thickness measurements at 10 points uniformly distributed over the cover glass slide with attached biofilm."

7,Structure and hydrogen production of PSB biofilm formed under varying illumination intensity,"3.1 Structure and hydrogen production of PSB biofilm formed under varying illumination intensity To study the effect of illumination intensity in the start-up stage on the morphology and hydrogen production performance of PSB biofilm, the PSB cells were immobilized on the cover glass slide under three illumination intensities (I S), namely 1000, 5000 and 8000lx, at constant illumination wavelength (λ S =590nm), flow rate (V S =228ml/h), and influent substrate concentration (C S =60mmol/l). After successful biofilm formation, the continuous hydrogen production of the bioreactor was measured under various illumination intensities and wavelengths as well as substrate solution concentrations and flow rates. In the following section, we discuss the effect of illumination conditions on the formation of PSB biofilm. 3.1.1 Biofilm formation under varying illumination intensity As noted above, SEM was utilized to visualize the biofilm morphology and microstructure of R. palustris CQK 01 immobilized on the cover glass slide. Representative SEM images of biofilm formed under different illumination intensities are presented in Fig. 2 a, where the magnification factor is 6000. It can be seen that the predominant morphology of the bacteria in the biofilm was short rods at 1000, 5000 and 8000lx, while a few long rods were present where cells had aggregated optionally. The bacterial size distributions were 2.0–2.5μm in length and 0.5–0.7μm in diameter at 1000lx; 3.5–4.5μm in length and 1.2–1.5μm in diameter at 5000lx; and 3.0–4.0μm in length and 0.5–0.8μm in diameter at 8000lx. Material resembling extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) is also visible in the three images. EPS enhanced biofilm development by binding the cells together to form a complex assemblage of cells trapped within an organic matrix, together with their metabolic products (Characklis and Cooksey, 1983). The EPS content of the biofilm formed under 8000lx illumination was significantly larger than at 1000 and 5000lx (Fig. 2a). In addition, voids were found to be distributed among the bacterial cells and EPS within structurally heterogeneous biofilms, creating pathways for transport of substrates and metabolic products, and light penetration. Higher EPS content resulted in lower biofilm porosity at 8000lx. Sasikala et al. (1991) indicated that the light saturation point of photo-hydrogen production was around 5000lx. Consequently, PSB activity increased with increase in illumination intensity up to 5000lx, and the size of single cells became larger with improvement of illumination conditions, so that PSB cells formed under 5000lx illumination were significantly larger than PSB cells formed under 1000lx illumination. Increase in illumination intensity beyond the light saturation point of 5000lx leads to depression in the synthesis of photopigments so as to reduce the ability of photoheterotrophic growth in PSB biofilm under anaerobic conditions. It is well known that the bacteria in a biofilm matrix have the ability to continuously adapt to changing conditions to ensure their reproduction and maintenance under different ambient conditions. Thus the PSB biofilm formed under 8000lx illumination produced more EPS to protect the cells from deteriorating, while the size of the cells decreased due to limitation of bacterial activity. The experimentally determined dry weight and thickness of the mature biofilms are shown in Fig. 2b. The dry weight increased initially with increase in illumination intensity, and thereafter declined. The highest dry weight was 0.915mg/cm2 at 5000lx illumination intensity. The thickness of biofilm decreased monotonically as the illumination intensity increased; the largest value was 22.2×10−6 m at 1000lx. It is well known that hydrogen production is influenced by not only bacterial biomass but also the microstructure of biofilm, which affects light penetration and substrate and product transport. Consequently, it is essential to investigate the hydrogen production performance of biofilm formed under a variety of conditions, to determine the relationship between hydrogen production and biofilm formation. In the next section, we present experimental data on hydrogen production of biofilm formed under illumination intensities 1000, 5000 and 8000lx, and discuss the effect of biofilm formation on hydrogen production performance of the PSB biofilm photobioreactor. 3.1.2 Hydrogen production performance of PSB biofilm formed under different illumination intensities The variation of hydrogen production performance of PSB biofilm with illumination wavelength for biofilms formed under various illumination intensities is shown in Fig. 3 a. In general, for the biofilms formed under 1000, 5000 and 8000lx illumination intensity, the average H2 production rate and yield, and light conversion efficiency increased as the illumination wavelength was increased from 470 to 590nm, and then decreased gradually when the illumination wavelength was further increased to 630nm. This indicates that all of the biofilms had peak hydrogen production performance at 590nm illumination wavelength. It is well known that different types of PSB may absorb light selectively in certain wavelength ranges to stimulate photo-hydrogen production. The absorption spectrum of R. palustris CQK 01, experimentally determined in our previous study (Tian et al., 2010), showed absorption maxima at 590, 806 and 863nm due to the effect of the bacteriochlorophyll α of the purple non-sulfur bacterium, and illumination bands at about 319 and 379nm due to the carotenoid content (Tian et al., 2010). In the present experiments, the illumination wavelength corresponding to peak hydrogen production performance coincided with the absorption maximum at 590nm for the bacterium. The light energy at this wavelength could be effectively absorbed by bacteriochlorophyll α to enhance bacterial activity for ATP synthesis and evolve hydrogen. Fig. 3a also shows that the biofilm formed under 5000lx illumination intensity exhibited the best hydrogen production performance, at illumination wavelengths from 470 to 630nm. This is attributed mainly to the fact that the PSB biofilm formed at 5000lx had the largest biomass, corresponding to the largest dry weight among the biofilms (Fig. 2b), which led to the higher hydrogen production rate. Furthermore, the biofilm formed at 5000lx had larger bacterial cell size and comparatively larger porosity (see Fig. 2a) as well as smaller thickness (see Fig. 2b). All of these characteristics were advantageous for enhancing the metabolizing capacity of the photosynthetic bacteria and the transport of substrates, products and light energy. The maxima of average H2 production rate, H2 yield and light conversion efficiency for the biofilm formed at 5000lx were 11.2mmol/m2/h, 0.25mol H2/mol glucose and 8.9%, respectively. The biofilm formed at 1000lx had larger biomass and porosity compared with the biofilm formed at 8000lx (see Fig. 2). Consequently, the hydrogen production performance of the biofilm formed at 1000lx was higher than that of the biofilm formed at 8000lx even though the biofilm formed at 1000lx had a larger thickness, which is a disadvantage for transport of substrates, products and light energy. It was concluded from the experiments discussed above that the biofilms presented the highest hydrogen production performance at 590nm wavelength. We conducted further experiments to study the effect of illumination intensity on the average H2 production rate, H2 yield and light conversion efficiency of the biofilms at 590nm illumination wavelength. The experimental results, shown in Fig. 3b, indicate that for all of the biofilms the average H2 production rate and H2 yield continuously increased as illumination intensity was increased from 1000 to 5000lx. Further increase in illumination intensity led to decrease of the average H2 production rate and H2 yield. This trend can be explained as follows. At lower illumination intensity, light energy was insufficient for bacterial activity, thus the H2 production rate and H2 yield increased with increase in illumination intensity. When the illumination intensity was increased to above 5000lx, the synthesis of photopigments was reduced, which reduced the ability for photoheterotrophic growth in the PSB under anaerobic conditions, thus decreasing H2 production rate and yield. This is in agreement with the light saturation point of PSB hydrogen production at about 5000lx, as indicated by Sasikala et al. (1991). In addition, Fig. 3b shows that the light conversion efficiency decreased monotonically with increase in illumination intensity. For instance, the light conversion efficiency of biofilm formed at 5000lx decreased from 28.1% to 5.2% when illumination intensity was increased from 1000 to 8000lx. Reduction of light conversion efficiency of PSB with increasing illumination intensity has been reported previously (Akkerman et al., 2002; Chen and Chang, 2006; Yamada et al., 1999). There are two possible explanations. It may be that not all light can be absorbed at high illumination intensity. Alternatively, the energy supply may exceed the metabolic capability of nitrogenase, leading to low light conversion efficiency (Barbosa et al., 2001; Nakada et al., 1995). Fig. 3b also shows that the biofilm formed at 5000lx exhibited the highest hydrogen production performance. Fig. 3c shows that the substrate flow rate played an important role in average H2 production rate, H2 yield and light conversion efficiency, which first increased as the substrate flow rate was increased from 30 to 70ml/h, then declined sharply when the substrate flow rate exceeded 70ml/h. Both high- and low-end flow rates appeared to be unfavorable for H2 production. Increased substrate flow rate can enhance substrate transport from liquid phase to biofilm and thus increase the substrate concentration in the biofilm. At lower substrate flow rate, the biodegradation of substrate and photo-hydrogen production were dominated primarily by the mass-transfer rate of substrate; accordingly the H2 production rate was elevated by increasing the substrate flow rate. However, when the substrate concentration in biofilm was increased to above the metabolic capacity of PSB, the biodegradation of substrate and hydrogen production were dominated by the metabolic capacity of PSB. In this situation, the metabolism of PSB in biofilm would be inhibited by the substrate so that hydrogen production decreased significantly as the substrate flow rate increased. This is the reason for peak hydrogen production at the substrate flow rate of 70ml/h for all of the biofilms. The light conversion efficiency was equivalent to the H2 production rate for specific illumination intensity and wavelength. Thus the light conversion efficiency and hydrogen production rate had similar variation with the substrate flow rate (Fig. 3c). Fig. 3c also shows that the average H2 production rate, H2 yield and light conversion efficiency of the biofilm formed at 5000lx were larger than for the biofilms formed at 1000 and 8000lx. Furthermore, the effect of substrate flow rate on hydrogen production was significantly larger for the biofilm formed at 5000lx than for the biofilms formed at 1000 and 8000lx. This trend is due to the fact that the PSB biofilm formed at 5000lx possessed larger cells, smaller thickness and larger porosity, which reduced the mass-transfer resistance of substrate from liquid phase to biofilm. The substrate concentration in the biofilm was more sensitive to change of substrate concentration near the surface of the biofilm, and the effect of substrate flow rate became more significant. Fig. 3d shows the effect of glucose concentration on the average H2 production rate, H2 yield and light conversion efficiency for biofilms formed at 1000, 5000 and 8000lx. The average H2 production rate and light conversion efficiency increased with increase of glucose concentration from 20 to 60mmol/l, and decreased gradually as the glucose concentration was further increased. This trend is reasonable because at lower substrate concentration the bacteria had sufficient metabolic capacity for conversion of glucose to hydrogen, so that the average H2 production rate was dominated by the mass-transfer rate of substrate, implying that it increased with increase in substrate concentration. By contrast, at higher substrate concentration the glucose concentration became a limiting factor for hydrogen production, which has been verified by numerous previous studies. For instance, Barbosa et al. (2001) reported that hydrogen production rate was limited at acetate concentrations of 6 and 10mM. Consequently, the hydrogen production rate decreased as the substrate concentration increased at higher substrate concentration. The light conversion efficiency showed a similar change to the hydrogen production rate since it was proportional to hydrogen production rate at specific illumination intensity and wavelength. However, it should be noted that the H2 yield decreased monotonically with increase of glucose concentration over the whole glucose concentration range (Fig. 3d). The highest H2 yields were 0.61, 0.66 and 0.53mol H2/mol glucose at substrate concentration 20mmol/l for the biofilms formed at 1000, 5000 and 8000lx, respectively. The reason for the diminution of hydrogen yield is mainly that the metabolic pathway of photosynthetic bacteria was greatly affected by substrate concentration, thus the intermediate products were significantly different for various substrate concentrations. At higher glucose concentrations, the accumulation of undissociated organic acids (e.g. formic acid, lactic acid) led to the reduction of the hydrogen yield (Akutsu et al., 2009)."
8,Structure and hydrogen production of PSB biofilm formed at different illumination wavelengths,"3.2 Structure and hydrogen production of PSB biofilm formed at different illumination wavelengths To study the effect of illumination wavelength on PSB biofilm formation and hydrogen production performance, PSB biofilms were individually immobilized on cover glass slides under illumination wavelengths 470, 590 and 630nm at constant illumination intensity (I S =5000lx), flow rate (V S =228ml/h) and substrate concentration (C S =60mmol/l). The biofilm morphology and hydrogen production performance were investigated. 3.2.1 Biofilm formation at different illumination wavelengths Fig. 4 a shows the morphology of photosynthetic bacterial biofilm formed on cover glass slides under illumination with wavelength 470, 590 and 630nm. The bacterial cells in the biofilm formed at 590nm generally presented a larger short rod shape 3.5–4.5μm in length and 1.2–1.5μm in diameter. The biofilms formed at 470 and 630nm both had smaller short rod-like bacterial cells with size range 2.9–3.3μm length and 0.6–0.8μm diameter for 470nm, and 2.0–2.5μm length and 0.9–1.1μm diameter for 630nm. Fig. 4a also shows that EPS production varied dramatically with illumination wavelength, which resulted in different void distributions within the biofilms formed at different illumination wavelengths. It is apparent that the biofilm formed at 590nm had the lowest EPS content and thus largest porosity, which favors transport of light energy, substrates and products. As noted above, bacteriochlorophyll α in R. palustris has an absorption maximum at 590nm, implying that the bacteria of the biofilm had higher activity for ATP synthesis. Hence the biofilm formed at 590nm had larger size and smaller EPS content. The experimentally determined dry weight and thickness of the biofilms formed at different illumination wavelengths are shown in Fig. 4b. Both the dry weight and the thickness of biofilm decreased significantly with increased illumination wavelength, and correspondingly the largest dry weight (1.013mg/cm2) and thickness (27.8×10−6 m) were found for the biofilm formed at 470nm. This is because the absorbance of R. palustris CQK 01 at about 470nm is associated with carotenoids (Akiba et al., 1983) that stimulate growth of the bacteria. In the next section, we discuss the hydrogen production performance of the biofilms formed at different illumination wavelengths. 3.2.2 Hydrogen production performance of PSB biofilm formed at different illumination wavelengths Fig. 5 a presents the variation of average H2 production rate, H2 yield and light conversion efficiency with illumination wavelength for biofilms formed at 470, 590 and 630nm. The average H2 production rate, H2 yield and light conversion efficiency increased with increase of illumination wavelength from 470 to 590nm, and decreased with increase of wavelength from 590 to 630nm. In addition, the biofilm formed at 590nm had the highest H2 production rate, H2 yield and light conversion efficiency. The thickness of the biofilm formed at 470nm was 47.3% and 64.7% larger, and the dry weight only 9.7% and 20.2% larger than for the biofilms formed at 590 and 630nm, respectively. Furthermore, the quantity of EPS produced induced very low porosity of the biofilm formed at 470nm (Fig. 4a). The larger thickness and smaller porosity of that biofilm led to higher resistance to the transport of substrates and products as well as light energy, which caused comparatively lower hydrogen production performance even though it possessed the largest biomass. By contrast, the biofilm formed at 590nm had larger dry weight and moderate thickness that were 9.5% and 11.1% larger, respectively, than for the biofilm formed at 630nm, and greater porosity and bacterial size (Fig. 4a). These characteristics facilitated transport of the substrate, products, and light energy and enhanced the metabolic activity of PSB. Consequently, the biofilm formed at 590nm exhibited the best photo-hydrogen production performance of the three biofilms. The variation of average H2 production rate, H2 yield, and light conversion efficiency with illumination intensity are shown in Fig. 5b for the biofilms formed at 470, 590 and 630nm. The average H2 production rate and H2 yield initially increased with increasing illumination intensity from 1000 to 5000lx, but decreased at illumination intensity above 5000lx. This indicated again that the saturation illumination intensity for R. palustris CQK 01 biofilm was around 5000lx. Fig. 5b also shows that increase of illumination intensity resulted in decreased light conversion efficiency. The maximum light conversion efficiencies were 7.7%, 28.1% and 24.6% at 1000lx illumination intensity for the biofilms formed at illumination wavelengths 470, 590 and 630nm, respectively. The PSB biofilm formed at 590nm had the highest hydrogen production performance of the three biofilms. Fig. 5c shows that the average H2 production rate and light conversion efficiency increased with increase in substrate flow rate up to 70ml/h, then decreased as the flow rate increased further. The hydrogen production performance of the biofilm formed at 590nm was clearly higher than for the biofilms formed at 470 and 630nm. Correspondingly, the effect of substrate flow rate on hydrogen production performance was most significant for the biofilm formed at 590nm. The larger porosity and cell size together with comparatively small thickness of that biofilm reduced the mass-transfer resistance of substrates and products in the biofilm, which made the substrate concentration in biofilm more sensitive to changing substrate load in the liquid phase. Consequently, the variation of hydrogen production performance with substrate flow rate was more significant for the biofilm formed at 590nm. The variation of the average H2 production rate, H2 yield, and light conversion efficiency with substrate concentration are shown in Fig. 5d for biofilms formed at 470, 590 and 630nm. It is apparent that both average H2 production rate and light conversion efficiency increased, for each biofilm, with increase in glucose concentration in the range 20–60mmol/l, and decreased at larger glucose concentrations (60–80mmol/l). Correspondingly, the H2 yield continuously decreased with increasing glucose concentration within the whole experimental range. The highest H2 yields were 0.34, 0.66 and 0.36molH2/mol glucose for the biofilms formed at 470, 590 and 630nm, respectively. This behavior was consistent with other observations discussed above. The hydrogen production performance of the biofilm formed at 590nm was still superior to that of biofilms formed at the other wavelengths, while being more significantly impacted by substrate concentration, which resulted mainly from the smaller mass-transfer resistance of substrates and products in the biofilm formed at 590nm."
9,Conclusion,"R. palustris CQK 01 was immobilized on the surface of a cover glass slide in a flat-panel photobioreactor to enhance photo-hydrogen production performance. The formation of PSB biofilm was greatly influenced by illumination intensity and wavelength. The PSB biofilm formed under illumination conditions of 590nm and 5000lx had the highest hydrogen production performance due to higher dry weight and advantageous microstructure. The maximum average H2 production rate of 11.2mmol/m2/h was obtained at 70ml/h flow rate and glucose concentration 60mmol/l, while H2 yield and light conversion efficiency were 0.25molH2/mol glucose and 8.9%, respectively."
