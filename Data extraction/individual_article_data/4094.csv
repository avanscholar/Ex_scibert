0,Introduction,"Thermal conductivity is a key parameter of a heat-transfer medium and is an important component of achieving an efficient transport of heat in electric and mechanical devices. Towards the goal of improving the molecular-level tuning of thermal conductivity, it is essential to understand the relationship between thermal conductivity and the underlying microscopic energy transfer among the constituent molecules. The thermal conductivity of gases is reasonably explained as the migration of molecules in the kinetic theory [1]. On the other hand, sophisticated microscopic theories involving phonon conduction have been developed for heat conduction in solids [2,3] and nanomaterials such as low-dimensional carbon materials [4,5]. In contrast to these cases, the microscopic energy transfer in liquids is less well understood. In such a situation, a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation [6] is a realistic means to investigate the macro-micro connection of heat transport in liquids [7,8]. Recent MD studies aimed to clarify how a specific molecular-level structure affects thermal conductivity in complex liquids, such as nanofluids [9], mixtures [10], confined liquids [11], etc. However, the microscopic energy transfer inside and among molecules, themselves, has received much less attention and therefore many facets of its nature still remains unexplored, even for pure liquids. In liquids, molecules transfer thermal energy mostly via interatomic forces. Accumulating knowledge on the heat transfer due to each type of interatomic force is a logical step towards achieving a molecular theory that might allow us to design liquid thermal conductivity. As an extension of the scheme to decompose thermal conductivity into the contributions from different kinds of interactions [12,13], we recently proposed the atomistic heat path (AHP) analysis [14], which enables us to inspect how a single interatomic interaction contributes to the thermal conductivity. With the AHP analysis, the basic properties of energy transfer by the intermolecular van der Waals (vdW) interaction and intramolecular (bond stretching, angle bending, and torsion) interactions were clarified from the NEMD study of linear and branched alkanes [14]. As a next step, the nature of the energy transfer by the Coulomb interaction was revealed in a previous NEMD study on alcohols [15]. In these studies, the density and temperature conditions were set to those of the saturated liquids at a scaled temperature T/T c = 0.7, where T is the temperature of the simulation system and T c is the critical temperature of the liquid. In our previous study of alcohols [15], this somewhat special thermodynamic condition was necessary in order to compare an alkane and an alcohol at an equivalent liquid state to extract the effect of the hydroxyl group (OH). Because of the lack of experimental observations at this special condition, the alcohol model employed could not be sufficiently validated against the experimental thermal conductivity. Also, a comparison of different alcohols at the same absolute temperature, rather than the same scaled temperature, may be of more practical interest. In fact, simulation studies on the thermal conductivity of alcohols are quite limited except for methanol and ethanol [16,17]. In light of this, the present study performed NEMD simulations of five linear alcohols ranging from ethanol to decanol at the standard state, 298 K and 1 atm. Thermal conductivity, the microscopic energy transfer involving each type of interaction, and liquid structures were calculated as a function of chain length. Analyzing these results, we discussed their mutual relationships and clarified the microscopic origin of the chain length dependence of alcohol thermal conductivity."
1,Theory and methodology,
2,Molecular model and simulation procedures,"2.1 Molecular model and simulation procedures In the present paper, the five linear alcohols listed in Table 1 were examined. The molecular model employed for these alcohols was based on a combination of the NERD force fields for alkane [18] and alcohol [19]; the NERD-alkane force field [18] was used for the intramolecular interactions for the alkyl chain while the NERD-alcohol force field [19] was used for other parts. This combination of NERD force fields was introduced in the previous study [15] in order to extract the effect of hydroxyl group. The details of the potential function forms and the parameters used in the present study are summarized in Table 2 . This model is a united-atom model, i.e., a hydrocarbon unit CH x (x = 2 for methylene or x = 3 for terminal methyl group) in the alkyl chain is treated as a single site whereas the hydroxyl H and O atoms are considered explicitly. The hydroxyl H and O, and the CH2 group adjacent to O have a partial charge. The sites interact via the vdW interaction expressed by the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, the Coulomb interaction, and the intramolecular bond stretching, angle bending, and torsion interactions. Both the vdW and Coulomb interactions also operate between two intramolecular sites separated by four covalent bonds or more. In the present case, however, there is no intramolecular Coulomb interaction because all the charged sites in the molecule, i.e., the hydroxyl H, O and the nearby CH2, are connected within two bonds. The NEMD simulations were performed with our in-house MD program, which has been employed to investigate the molecular heat transfers in alkane liquids [14], self-assembled monolayers of alkanethiol [20], amorphous polymers [21], etc. The reversible reference system propagator algorithm [22] was used for the numerical integration of the equations of motion with time steps of 1 fs and 0.2 fs for the slow intermolecular and fast intramolecular motions, respectively. The vdW interaction was evaluated with a cutoff distance of 12.0 Å. The Coulomb interaction was evaluated with the smooth particle mesh Ewald (SPME) method [23]. For each alcohol, an equilibrium MD (EMD) simulation of the isobaric–isothermal ensemble [24] was carried out to derive the liquid density at 298 K and 1 atm in advance of the NEMD simulation. In accordance with this liquid density, the simulation box for the NEMD simulation was constructed with a fixed number of molecules and volume with 3-dimensional periodic boundary conditions. A schematic of the simulation box is depicted in Fig. 1 (a) while the system size and the density condition are listed in Table 1. First, an equilibrium state at 298 K was made by a 2 ns isothermal simulation with velocity scaling, which was followed by another 2 ns microcanonical simulation. Then, the hot and cold slabs were heated up and cooled down, respectively, with the RNEMD method of Jund and Jullien [25] to apply a constant external heat flux of J ext = 300 MW/m2. After a 5 ns relaxation run to ensure a steady state constant temperature gradient, the necessary data were sampled for τ run∼ 110 ns as listed in Table 1. The control volumes, within which the physical properties were calculated, were separated by a length L from the heat source and the heat sink in order to avoid any unphysical effect. The control volume was divided into local slabs in the z direction of a width Δz = 1 Å, and the local temperature for each slab was calculated. From the local temperature profile, the value of the temperature gradient, ∂T/∂z, was obtained by a linear fit as shown in Fig. 1(b), and the thermal conductivity λ was calculated from Fourier's law as (1) J ext = − λ ∂ T / ∂ z . The thermal conductivity was separately obtained for each of the two control volumes in the system, and then the average of the two values was taken. From a viewpoint of macroscopic practical applications, a heat flux of the order of 102 MW/m2, as used in the present study, is quite high and the time scale of ∼102 ns very short. However, conditions of this magnitude are commonly used in current NEMD simulation studies [8], and were sufficient to explain the experimental results of thermal conductivity in the case of our alkanes study [26]."
3,Analysis of microscopic energy transfer,"2.2 Analysis of microscopic energy transfer Suppose that the heat flux J ext is imposed in the z direction. At a nonequilibrium steady state, the total internal heat flux J tot, which on average is equal to J ext, is induced. The microscopic expression of J tot is written as [12,14]. (2) J tot = 1 V CV ∑ s ∈ CV e s v s , z + 1 V CV ∑ X 1 n ∑ s ∈ X ∑ α = 1 n − 1 ∑ β = α + 1 n ( f X , s α , s · v s α − f X , s Β , s · v s β ) ( z s α − z s β ) ∗ , where V CV is the control volume, z s , v s,z , v s , and e s are the z-coordinate, the z-component of velocity, velocity vector, and energy (potential + kinetic energy) of atom s, respectively, and ( z s α − z s β ) ∗ represents the portion of ( z s α − z s β ) involved in the control volume. X specifies the type of interaction, which in the present case is either the vdW, Coulomb, bond stretching, angle bending, or torsion interactions. Here, f X , s , s = − ∇ s U X , s ( n ) is the n-body force of type X on atom s, where s represents the n indexes of the atoms on which the n-body potential U X , s ( n ) depends. In Eq. (2), the first term, which we call the transport term, represents the energy transfer associated with atomic migration while the second term, which we call the interaction term, stands for that resulting from interatomic interactions. The interaction term is the dominant part of J tot in liquid phases [14,26] and we analyze this term in more detail by using the atomistic heat path (AHP) analysis [14] as explained below. Equation (2) tells that the energy transfer by the interaction of type X contributes to J tot by (3) J X = 1 V CV 1 n ∑ s ∈ X ∑ α = 1 n − 1 ∑ β = α + 1 n ( f X , s α , s · v s α − f X , s Β , s · v s β ) ( z s α − z s β ) ∗ . This partial heat flux J X can be calculated from the NEMD simulation. However, since the direct calculation of the partial heat flux of the Coulomb interaction, J Cl, by Eq. (3) is time-consuming, we calculated it indirectly by subtracting all the contributions other than J Cl from the total imposed flux J ext. On the other hand, the per-atom Coulomb potential energy, which is necessary to calculate the transport term in Eq. (2), was computed with the real-space-sum method of Fennell and Gezelter [27], independently of the SPME evaluation of the Coulomb force and potential for solving the equation of motion. Associated with the partial heat flux J X , the partial thermal conductivity λ X is given as (4) λ X = λ J X / J tot , if one assumes Fourier's law J X = −λ X ∂T/∂z also for the partial contributions. The AHP analysis considers the single interatomic interaction as the path of heat, which is called the AHP, and expresses the partial thermal conductivity as the multiplication of the density of paths, ρ path X , and the efficiency of a single path, Λ X , for a specific interaction X: (5) λ X = ρ path X Λ X . This equation is used to derive the efficiency Λ X from λ X and ρ path X , which can be calculated in the NEMD simulation. The partial conductivity λ X can be obtained from Eqs. (3) and (4). The path density ρ path X is obtained by directly counting the number of the interactions in the system as below. For the intramolecular interactions (X = intramolecular vdW, stretching, angle, and torsion), one n-body interaction corresponds to one AHP and the density is given by (6) ρ path X = 1 V CV ∑ s ∈ X 1 . One intermolecular vdW interaction is counted as an AHP only if the distance between the interacting atom pair is less than the first neighbor shell radius, η ab , on the basis of the finding that the vdW interaction does not transfer net heat beyond the first neighbor shell [28]. With this criterion, the density of the vdW paths is given by (7) ρ path vdW = ∑ A B n A B V CV 2 ∫ 0 η A B 4 π r 2 g A B ( r ) d r , where g AB is the radial distribution function (RDF) for AB atom pairs and η AB is the first neighbor shell radius of g AB . The number of A B pairs, n AB , is given by n AB = n A n B if A ≠ B and n AB = n A (n A −1)/2 if A = B, where n A is the number of A atoms in the control volume. Different from the case of the vdW interaction, the heat transfer by the Coulomb interaction between charged atoms is quite long-range. In the previous study [15], we defined the charge neutral group Q comprising the hydroxyl H, O, and CH2 unit adjacent to O and considered the Coulomb heat path between these charge neutral groups. It was shown that the Coulomb heat transfer between Qs converges much more rapidly with distance than that between charged atoms. A significant part of the inter-Q Coulomb heat transfer occurred within a shell radius η QQ, which is the second or the first neighbor shell radius of the Q−Q RDF, depending on whether the first neighbor shell is formed by the hydrogen bond or not, respectively. The remainder of the heat transfer from R > η QQ was of little relevance to liquid structures, where R is the distance between two Q cites. Based on these observations, we defined the Coulomb interaction for R ≤ η QQ as the Coulomb path. The same definition is used in the present study. In analogy with Eq. (7), the density of the Coulomb paths is given by (8) ρ path Cl = n QQ V CV 2 ∫ 0 η QQ 4 π R 2 g QQ ( R ) d R . The contribution for R > η QQ is approximated to be uniformly distributed and is to be included effectively in the efficiency Λ Cl = λ Cl / ρ path Cl since the partial thermal conductivity λ Cl contains both the short- and long-range contributions. The different kinds of the AHPs involved in the present study are depicted in Fig. 2 . Thermal conductivity is linked to the distribution of AHPs, which is determined by the molecular arrangement within some neighbor shell."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Thermal conductivity,"3.1 Thermal conductivity The thermal conductivity obtained from the NEMD simulations are plotted as a function of chain length in Fig. 3 (a), compared to the experimental results. Also, the density condition and the experimental density from Ref. [29] is plotted in Fig. 3(b). The chain length is quantified with the number of carbon atoms in a molecule, n, and hereafter the alcohol of chain length n is denoted by C n . As representative experimental results on alcohol thermal conductivity, we chose the correlation equation by Assael [30], which was derived from experiments. Also, relatively recent results of Powell and Groot [31] and Raal and Rijsdijk [32] were included in Fig. 3(a). The numerical values of our NEMD simulation results and the correlation equation by Assael are listed in Table 1. The experimental thermal conductivities from C2 to C10 are 0.15–0.20 W/(m⋅K) and have a minimum around n = 4 or 6. The thermal conductivities derived from the NEMD simulations systematically underestimated the experimental values by 24% on average. As can be seen in Fig. 3(b), the present molecular model tends to give a lower liquid density than the experimental one, which is likely the main reason of the underestimation in thermal conductivity. A similar underestimation in liquid density was also reported for the OPLS-alcohol model [33], which is the base of many other models. Petravic [16] showed that the OPLS ethanol underestimates the thermal conductivity by approximately 10%. In her simulation, the liquid density was set to the experimentally observed value. A further reduction in thermal conductivity is therefore expected if, as in our case, the simulation was performed at the computationally determined density condition. The molecular model developed by Schnabel et al. [34,35] was shown to reproduce the thermal conductivity of methanol and ethanol within 5% error [17], but their model has not been extended to longer alcohols. In spite of the deviation in thermal conductivity from the experimental values, our NEMD curve has a similar trend, including the location of the minimum, to the experimental ones. It is therefore expected that the inherent molecular mechanism that determines the chain length dependence of thermal conductivity is the same in both the experiments and the present simulations. On the other hand, the discrepancy among the different experimental results in Fig. 3(a) indicates that except for short chain species, the variation in thermal conductivity with chain length is likely smaller than the uncertainty in the experiments at that time. In that sense, it is proper to conclude that thermal conductivity is almost constant for > C4, rather than having a shallow minimum, as a function of chain length. Comparison using a more sophisticated force field and more accurate experimental results is thus desired in future. Although it is necessary to keep these issues on force field and experimental uncertainty in mind, the present simulation is still valuable in understanding the essence of the relationship between molecular heat transfer mechanisms, chain length, and macroscopic thermal conductivity. Fig. 4 shows the breakdown of the total heat flux into different microscopic modes of energy transfer. The transport term accounts for only 13% even for ethanol, which is the largest case. The interaction term thus accounts for the largest part of the thermal conduction in alcohols, as is the case for other liquids including a LJ liquid [28] and alkanes [14,26]. As the chain length increases, the main mode of energy transfer shifts from intermolecular to intramolecular transfer. This mode shift is due to the increasing degrees of freedom of intramolecular motions and was also seen in alkane liquids [14,26]. The contribution from the Coulomb interaction, J Cl, is the largest for ethanol, but its value of 22% is about one half of the intermolecular vdW components, J vdW, which contributes 44%. In addition, J Cl decreases more rapidly than J vdW with chain length. Thus, the Coulomb interaction is not a main path of heat transfer in the linear alcohols. These tendencies of the decomposed heat fluxes are qualitatively the same as those observed for the saturated liquid states [15] at higher temperature, 0.7T c, which is from 383 to 467 K for from C2 to C10, respectively, although the transport term is 1.6–3.0 times smaller for the present cases. This similarity between the different thermodynamic conditions implies the possibility that the power balance, with respect to energy transfer, between the intramolecular, vdW, and Coulomb interactions in liquid alcohol is mainly determined by chain length rather than by temperature and density conditions."
6,Neighbor shell structures,"3.2 Neighbor shell structures The density of the intermolecular vdW paths is determined by the coordination number of atoms within the first neighbor shell and thus is related to the radial distribution function (RDF). The RDF for intermolecular A B atom pairs, i.e., the A and B atoms are in different molecules, are shown in Fig. 5 . The sharp peaks at 1.8 Å for the OH RDF and at 2.75 Å for the OO RDF represent hydrogen bonds. The positions of the first peak and minima are in good agreement with those in previous MD studies on ethanol and methanol, in which slightly different alcohol models from that used in the present study were employed [33,36,37]. The average number of hydrogen bonds was calculated by the criterion which has been commonly used [36,37]; that is, we assumed a hydrogen bond for a molecular pair if r OH < η OH, r OO < η OO, and ∠OOH < 30°, where r AB is the distance between intermolecular A B atom pair and η AB is the radius of the first neighbor shell, which was obtained as the first minimum position of g AB . The statistics obtained for the hydrogen bonds is listed in Table 3 . The table shows that 98–99% of the molecules have a hydrogen bond, and the percentage of the molecules with no hydrogen bond (n = 0) slowly increases with chain length. For all the species, one molecule on average has two hydrogen bonds, consistent with previous MD studies [33,36,37]. Fig. 5 shows that the heights of the first peaks in the OH and OO RDFs increase with change length. On the other hand, the chain length has little influence on the first peak positions and first neighbor shell radii η AB of the OH, OO, and OC RDFs because these peaks correlate with a strong hydrogen bond. In contrast, the positions of the first peak and minimum of the CC RDF, which is not related to hydrogen bonding, do change slightly with chain length. These differences in the liquid structure affect the number of vdW paths. Fig. 6 shows the RDF of the charge neutral group Q. On the basis of the observations made above on the atomatom RDFs in Fig. 5, the first peak of the QQ RDF indicates a hydrogen bond and again the positions of the peak and minimum are not affected by chain length and the height of the peak increases with chain length. Therefore, according to the criteria explained in Section 2.2, η QQ in Eq. (8) was taken as the radius of the second neighbor shell for all the alcohol species in the present case. The second neighbor shell radius tends to increase with chain length, except that a relatively large η QQ is found for ethanol (C2). As mentioned above, for all the alcohols, one molecule has two hydrogen bonds on average. If the two molecules 1 and 2 are both hydrogen bonded with molecule 3, the correlation arises between molecules 1 and 2, which are the second neighbor molecule of each other. Because ethanol has only one CH3 unit outside the Q group, the correlation is likely to be particularly strong. We speculate that this correlation affects the structure of the second neighbor shell and thus leads to the irregularity of the η QQ of ethanol."
7,Molecular morphology,"3.3 Molecular morphology We also examined if the chain length dependence of thermal conductivity observed as in Fig. 3(a) is related to the change in molecular morphology, i.e., the transition from a linear molecular shape to more curled ones as the chain length increases. To this end, the radius of gyration R g and the intramolecular orientational correlation function K or were calculated. These morphological properties are commonly used to characterize long chain polymers [38] and their association with thermal conductivity was pointed out for such materials [39]. Here, the radius of gyration R g was calculated by (9) R g = 1 n a 〈 ∑ i = 0 n a − 1 ( r i − r M ) 2 〉 , where, r M is the center of mass vector of a molecule, r i is the position vector of the i-th atom in the molecule, and n a is the number of atoms in the molecule. The atoms in a molecule were indexed as i = 0, 1, 2, …, in the order of hydroxyl H, O, the next C, …, and the terminal C. The angled bracket indicates an average over different molecules and times. For a linear alcohol, R g is effectively considered as half of the molecular length with the winding being taking account. In the case of a polymer, the R g of a longer chain grows more slowly with chain length since the longer chain tends to curl, and typically R g ∝ n a results [38]. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 7 (a), the R g for the linear alcohols from C2 to C10 increases linearly with chain length, which indicates that the degree of winding is not significantly different for these alcohols. The orientational correlation function K or was defined as the correlation between the 0-th and i-th directors: (10) K or ( i ) = 〈 cos θ i 〉 = 〈 u 0 · u i | u 0 | | u i | 〉 , where θ i is the angle between 0-th and i-th directors and the i-th director is the unit vector u i /|u i | with u i = r i+1 – r i . The calculated curves for K or are displayed in Fig. 7(b). The zigzag shape of the curves for C2 to C10 reflects the trans form of alkyl chain. The curves for all the alcohols have almost the same shape except for the maximum value of i. It is therefore expected that these alcohols have the same persistence length. For decanol as a representative member, we estimated the persistence length i p , in terms of the segment index, by curve fitting with a function K or(i) = exp(−i/i p ). In the fitting, we included only the even numbers of i, in consideration of the trans form of the chain. The persistence length obtained was i p = 6.18. Only a few directors at the opposite ends of molecule in octane and decane are separated by a longer distance than this value of i p . Thus, most of the chain segments in a molecule are orientationally correlated, consistent with the behavior of R g in Fig. 7(a). The results in Fig. 7 indicate that there is no significant difference in morphology for different chain lengths. Therefore, we conclude that the morphology is not the main factor for the chain length dependence of the thermal conductivity observed in Fig. 3(a) and the rationale based on the AHP analysis is necessary."
8,Properties of atomistic heat path,"3.4 Properties of atomistic heat path The path density, efficiency, and partial thermal conductivity of intramolecular paths are shown in Fig. 8 (a)–(c), respectively, as a function of chain length, where the stretching, angle, and torsion AHPs are dealt with separately. Here, the intramolecular vdW interaction was not included in the analysis since it made little contribution to the total heat conduction as shown in Fig. 4. As can be seen from Fig. 8(a), all the path densities increases with chain length simply because the number of covalent bonds increases with increasing mass density as shown in Fig. 3(b). Fig. 8(b) reveals that the efficiencies of the three kinds of paths have the orders of magnitude of 10−31 −10−30 Wm2/K and tend to increase slightly with chain length. This order of magnitude and trend were similar to those observed for the saturated liquids of alkanes [14] and alcohols [15] at 0.7T c and are likely general features of thermal energy transfer inside an alkyl chain. The three components of intramolecular paths of C2 show relatively different efficiencies in comparison with longer species. This behavior is likely to have a structural origin since as shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the CC and QQ RDFs of C2 were somewhat different from those of longer species. Except for the behavior near C2, the partial thermal conductivity attributed to intramolecular paths, λ intra, increases with chain length as shown in Fig. 8(c) due to the increase in both the path density and efficiency. The path density, efficiency, and partial thermal conductivity of both the intermolecular vdW and Coulomb paths are shown in Fig. 9 (a)–(c), respectively, as a function of chain length. As shown in Fig. 9 (a), the density of the vdW paths increases with chain length, according to the increase in liquid density. In contrast, the density of the Coulomb paths decreases with chain length because longer alcohol molecules have a lower OH density. The density of the vdW paths is about one or more orders of magnitude higher than that of the Coulomb paths. In contrast, the Coulomb path has a higher efficiency than the vdW path by about one order of magnitude. In particular, the efficiency of the vdW path decreases with chain length whereas a constant value, within the error bar, is kept for the efficiency of the Coulomb path. This reduction in the efficiency of the vdW path with chain length is known to come from interference among multiple vdW paths [14]. That is, since the motions of different atoms in the same molecule are correlated, the vdW paths coming from the same molecule interfere with each other to reduce their path efficiencies. Because a longer chain leads to more vdW paths from one molecule, the efficiency decreases with chain length. As shown in Fig. 9(c), the partial thermal conductivity of the vdW path is higher than that of the Coulomb path, as was already indicated by Fig. 4. Our conclusion here is that the AHP analysis reveals that the large number of paths was the reason why the vdW interaction can transfer more heat than the Coulomb interaction. The chain length dependence of the total thermal conductivity is governed by that of the dominant path. As shown in Fig. 4, for short species from C2 to C4, the dominant path is the intermolecular path (Coulomb + vdW), which decreases with chain length. The thermal conductivity therefore decreases with chain length for these species. As the alkyl chain elongates, the dominant path shifts to the intramolecular path (bond stretching + angle bending + torsion), whose partial thermal conductivity increases with chain length. Thus, the thermal conductivity of alcohol behaves as shown in Fig. 3(a). This chain length dependence is similar to that of alkanes [14]. This similarity might be not surprising since the heat transfer by the Coulomb interaction, which is the main factor that differentiates the alkane and alcohol, is rather limited."
9,Conclusions,"NEMD simulations were performed to study the effect of chain length on both the microscopic energy transfer and macroscopic thermal conduction in liquids of linear alcohols at the standard condition. From the AHP analysis, it was clarified that the chain length dependence of thermal conductivity is determined as a result of the competition between the intermolecular and intramolecular paths, which respond differently to the change in chain length. On the other hand, the molecular morphology, which matters in long chain polymers, was not useful to explain this behavior of the thermal conductivity of the short chain alcohols treated here. Although the Coulomb interaction typically plays a crucial role in determining the physical properties in associated liquids, the heat transfer by the Coulomb interaction in the alcohols was limited owing to the quite small number of heat paths. However, the Coulomb interaction, as a single path, showed a much higher efficiency than the vdW interaction. Molecular species having more Coulomb paths are therefore interesting not only as potential liquids having a high thermal conductivity, but also as liquids having different mechanisms of molecular heat transfer from those of alkanes and monohydric alcohols. The present study provides a concrete picture of molecular heat transfer in liquid alcohols. Accumulating such insights is a necessary step towards the molecular theory of heat transfer in liquids."
