0,Introduction,"Currently, the aviation industry accounts for approximately 15% of global oil demand and is anticipated to keep growing until 2030 [1]. The combustion of fossil fuels derived from crude oil releases carbon dioxide, methane, soot, ultrafine particles (PM 0.1 ) and other pollutants, contributing significantly to climate change [2]. Soot [3] and ultrafine particles [4–7] released into the atmosphere can alter weather patterns and contribute to climate change. Human exposure to soot [8–10] and ultrafine particles [4,11] can have adverse health implications and can be linked to COVID-19 related deaths [12–14]. Despite the relative ease of electrification for land transportation, Conventional Aviation Fuel (CAF) remains the prominent means of powering the aviation industry [15] because of the high energy density of liquid fuels [16]. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) announced a vision to replace CAF with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2050 to lower the carbon footprint of the aviation industry [17]. Only a few SAFs are currently approved for commercial aircraft engines and are sourced from hydroprocessed esters, fatty acids and alcohols [18]. The performance of aircraft engines is sensitive to the properties of the fuels, and stringent regulations govern the quality of the fuel blends [19]. To meet the regulations and minimise the change in the quality of the resultant fuel blend, only low volumes (up to 50%) of SAFs can be blended with CAFs [19]. In practice, commercial SAFs are blended with CAFs at less than 10 vol.% due to the high cost and constrained supply of the feedstock to produce SAF [15,19–21]. Another approach to using SAFs in the aviation industry is by directly blending sustainably sourced esters, fatty acids and alcohols (i.e. without subsequent conversion to hydrocarbon fuels) with CAFs [18]. Esters, fatty acids and alcohols are also known as oxygenated fuels due to the oxygen present in their molecular structure [22]. Ethanol (EtOH) [23,24], dimethoxymethane (DMM) [25], poly(oxymethylene) dimethyl ethers (PODE) [25–30] and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) [31–34] are all examples of oxygenated fuels that have been identified as promising candidates for SAFs [25,35]. The blending of oxygenated fuels with jet fuels is effective in reducing soot formed in engines [36–38]. However, the composition of the blends and the thrust of the engine was found to influence the nanostructure of the soot [37]. This highlights the complexity of disentangling the effect of the operations of the engine from the effect of the blending of the oxygenated fuels [38]. Laboratory flame studies can be an effective means to evaluate the blending effects of oxygenated fuels with jet fuel under controlled combustion conditions [39]. Laminar laboratory flames have been used in the literature to compare the effect of different oxygenated fuels on the formation of soot and soot precursors when blended with hydrocarbon fuels [24,40–61]. Two of the most commonly studied class of oxygenated fuels in flames are alcohols and ethers. When EtOH and n-butanol blends with isooctane were compared in laminar premixed flames, n-butanol was found to induce a stronger soot reduction than EtOH [62]. However, a comparison between EtOH and methanol showed more complex behaviour in ethylene counterflow diffusion flames [57]. Methanol was observed to reduce the formation of soot at all blend strengths, whereas EtOH increased the formation of soot at low blend strengths and reduced the formation of soot at high blend strengths [57]. The observations do not show a clear trend in terms of which alcohol produces the highest reduction in the formation of soot. Comparisons of oxygenated fuel isomers were conducted by investigating the behaviour of butanol isomers in laminar premixed flames where the formation of soot precursors [44,45] and the resultant particle size distribution [55] were found to be influenced by the molecular structure of the isomers. The formation of soot precursor (benzene) was found to be highly dependent on the specific isomeric fuel. The tert-butanol flame formed the highest level of benzene, followed by iso-butanol, 2-butanol and 1-butanol. The formation of benzene was identified to be related to the formation of propargyl radicals from the decomposition of the butanol isomers [44,63–67]. When the EtOH and dimethyl ether (DME) isomers were compared, they showed a similar reduction in the formation of soot precursors in premixed n-pentane flames [53]. Interestingly, a small amount of DME was found to enhance the formation of soot more than EtOH in ethylene laminar coflow diffusion flames. This was shown to be because DME produces more methyl radicals than EtOH during fuel decomposition in the flame [40]. These investigations demonstrate that the oxygenated fuel-structure-specific chemistry affects the formation of soot precursors and soot. The ASTM D1322 standard specifies a test methodology for the characterisation of the sooting tendency of jet fuels using laboratory wick-fed laminar diffusion flames to measure the smoke point (SP) [18]. The SP is defined as the maximum flame length of a smokeless flame. Notwithstanding the standardisation of the methodology to gauge the quality of jet fuels based on their sooting tendency, it fails to provide crucial information about the characteristics and the properties of the emissions such as the size, the mass and the concentration of the particulates. The importance of these characteristics is evident from a recent announcement by the ICAO, which will introduce new standards regarding the regulation of the mass and the number of particulate emissions for the engines of aircraft [68]. Some investigations have sought to correlate the measurements of the sooting tendency of the oxygenated fuels in diesel blends with the engine particulate emission [69,70] and soot volume fractions [71] using ASTM D1322 SP lamps. Nevertheless, information about the correlation of measurements made using a SP lamp with the size of particulates is a gap that needs to be addressed, particularly considering the negative impact of ultrafine particles (PM 0.1 ) on the environment and health [4–7,11]. Many research groups have investigated the sooting behaviour of oxygenated fuels. However, it remains unclear which aspects of the fuels are most important in influencing the sooting behaviour. The structure of the molecules [70,72,73], bond saturation [69], oxygen content [74,75] and the oxygen-containing functional groups [69,72,73] have all been shown to influence the sooting tendency. In SP lamp studies of oxygenated fuels blended with diesel, the effect of the ‘dilution’ of the diesel with the oxygenated fuel was found to have the largest influence on soot reduction. The oxygenated functional groups were found to result in more significant differences in soot suppression behaviour [76]. Despite some improvements in understanding the factors that affect the sooting tendency of different oxygenated fuels, the relationship between sooting tendency and the quantities of practical value (i.e. particle size distribution and soot volume fraction) remains poorly understood. The purpose of this paper is to measure the sooting tendency of different oxygenated fuel-jet fuel blends using the standard ASTM smoke point lamp and to measure, analyse, and correlate the corresponding particle size distribution and soot volume fraction of the fuel mixtures. The analysis and correlations of the data will facilitate the understanding of the implications of using different oxygenated fuels that have been identified as promising candidates for SAFs, which can have practical value and relevance to the aviation industry."
1,Materials and methods,"A smoke point (SP) lamp was used to investigate laminar diffusion flames using liquid fuel blends. The SP was measured to provide an estimate of the sooting tendency of each fuel mixture. A quartz sampling probe connected to a Cambustion DMS500 Differential Mobility Spectrometer was used to measure the particle size distribution at the tip of the flame. A Blackfly S colour camera was used to image the flames and an in-house Python code [77] used to perform Abel inversion on the flame images to compute the soot volume fraction measurements. Figure 1 shows a schematic of the experimental setup. Thirteen fuel mixtures were investigated. The base fuel was a Jet A2 (POSF 10325) conventional kerosene [78] obtained from the United States National Jet Fuel Combustion Program (NJFCP) [79]. NJFCP has reported the detailed chemical composition and physical properties of Jet A2 [79]. The Jet A2 was blended at 5%, 10% and 20% by volume with poly(oxymethylene) dimethyl ether (PODE 3 ), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), dimethoxymethane (DMM) and ethanol (EtOH). The PODE 3 was procured from ASG Analytik-Service GmbH with a minimum purity of 95%. The impurities may include DMM, formaldehyde, 1,3,5-trioxane, PODE 2 [80]. These are oxygenated species and are not expected to induce significant changes in the sooting tendency of the PODE 3 . DMC, DMM and EtOH were procured from Tokyo Chemical Industry UK Ltd. The purities of DMC, DMM and EtOH are > 98%, > 98% and > 99.8%, respectively. The oxygenated fuels were used without further purification. The fuel blends were miscible without phase separation over time. This is important because phase separation indicates an incompatibility of the oxygenated fuel blending percentage with the hydrocarbon fuel [81]."
2,Smoke point and sooting indices,"2.1 Smoke point and sooting indices Typically, the smoke point (SP) is measured using a standardised ASTM D1322 procedure involving flames generated using a standard ASTM D1322 SP lamp [82]. The SP is defined as the flame height at which smoke is first observed to escape from the tip of the flame, where the height of the flame can be controlled by adjusting the exposed length of the wick of the SP lamp. The SP measurements enable the quantification of the sooting tendency of liquid fuels [82], where the SP is inversely proportional to sooting tendency [82,83]. The Threshold Sooting Index (TSI) enables a comparison of the sooting tendency of different hydrocarbon fuel blends on a unified scale that is independent of the SP apparatus [84–90]. The TSI provides an experimentally-obtained correlation with the SP [83] that is directly proportional to the molecular weight (MW) and inversely proportional to the SP of the fuel [91]. It has been shown to correlate with the molecular structure of the fuel molecules through structural group contributions, and can be useful in determining the sooting tendency of hydrocarbons and assist in the formulation and evaluation of fuels [92]. Nevertheless, TSI fails to consider the presence of oxygen in blends of hydrocarbons with oxygenated fuels. This is important because the oxygen in the fuel reduces the amount of oxygen required for stoichiometric combustion [91,93]. Hence, an analogous quantity, known as the Oxygen Extended Sooting Index (OESI), was introduced to take the additional oxygen into consideration [93] (1) OESI = a OESI ( n + m 4 − p 2 SP ) + b OESI , where n , m and p are the amount of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen in a fuel mixture with a generic fuel with mean formula C n H m O p . The evaluation of OESI requires the calibration of the a OESI and b OESI constants for each experimental setup. Currently, OESI is widely used in the literature to evaluate the sooting tendency of fuel blends containing oxygenated fuels [69,70,73,76]. In this work, we used a modified SP lamp that is equipped with a threaded fitting to adjust the exposed length of the wick and hence flow rate of the fuel in the wick-fed flame. The modified SP lamp has been described in detail previously [76,94]. We followed the ASTM D1322 [82] procedure to measure the SP of each fuel mixture. All SP measurements were repeated five times to obtain an average SP. The SP lamp was calibrated by measuring the SP of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane and toluene as reference fuel blends as per ASTM D1322 [82]. The OESI constants a OESI and b OESI were calibrated using 1-methylnapthalene, n-heptane, decane, toluene, cyclohexane and dodecane as reference fuels. The SPs of these reference fuels were measured and a OESI and b OESI computed to reproduce the defined OESI values for the reference fuels, where the OESI of n-heptane and 1-methylnapthalene were assigned values of 2.6 and 91 respectively to normalise the OESI scale in accordance to the procedure reported in the literature [83,93]. The a OESI and b OESI constants were computed to be 38.7 ± 4.0 and - 6.2 ± 0.7, respectively. The error of the OESI was computed using the error propagation method reported previously [94]. The method of the calculation of the uncertainties of the OESI can be found in Section A1 of the Supplementary Material."
3,Flame lengths and fuel flow rates,"2.2 Flame lengths and fuel flow rates The flame lengths were adjusted to about 24.5 mm for all flames during colour-ratio pyrometry and differential mobility spectrometry measurements. The chosen flame length is 0.5 mm below the SP of Jet A2, where Jet A2 has the lowest SP of all the fuel blends studied, similar to the procedure reported in the literature [71]. This approach is necessary to ensure that all the flames have a closed-tip for reliable soot volume fraction and particle size distribution measurements [71]. This is an important aspect of ensuring repeatability and maximising the accuracy of the measurements. Figure 2 shows the fuel flow rates of the flames with a fixed flame length of 24.5 mm. The fuel flow rates are within ± 10% deviation of the Jet A2 flame. The fuel consumption of each flame is reported in Section A2 of the Supplementary Material. The measurements were logged using a Precisa Series 320 XB analytical balance with a readability of 10 mg."
4,Colour-ratio pyrometry,"2.3 Colour-ratio pyrometry Colour-ratio pyrometry was used to measure the soot volume fraction ( f v ) of the flames [77,95,96]. The measurement system has been described in detail previously [61,77,97]. The image processing and soot volume fraction computations were executed using an in-house Python code [77,98] using the BASEX Abel inversion method [96,99,100]. Das et al. [96] estimated the uncertainties in the soot volume fraction to be about ± 10% in the wing, compared to 30–50% at the centre-line."
5,Differential mobility spectrometry,"2.4 Differential mobility spectrometry Typically, flames involving real fuels generate particles with a broad range of particle sizes [101]. Hence, in the current work, we selected the Cambustion DMS500 Differential Mobility Spectrometer to measure the particle size distribution (PSD) of the particles. The Cambustion DMS500 allows the measurement of a broad range of particles sizes, from 5 nm up to 2500 nm, enabling measurement of the full particle size distribution (above 5 nm) in the Jet A2 and blended flames. A quartz sampling probe with a needle valve is connected to the Cambustion DMS500 for PSD measurements at the tip of the flame, as shown in Fig. 1. Our previous work has described in detail the sampling procedure and the calibration and calculation of the dilution ratio [61,97]. In brief, we performed the sampling at the tip of the flame with an input nitrogen dilution flow of 8.4 SLPM and a room-probe pressure difference of Δ P = 35.0 mbar. The data reported for each flame are an average of five repeat measurements. The measurements were performed at the tip of the flame because it avoids the clogging of the probe and the issue of flame perturbation that would compromise the quality of the measurements when sampling inside the wick-fed diffusion flames. The current choice of sampling point has been shown to provide a strong measurement signal and meaningful results [88–90]."
6,Results and discussion,"In this section, the results of the oxygen extended sooting index (OESI), soot volume fraction ( f v ) and particle size measurements of the oxygenated fuel/Jet A2 wick-fed laminar diffusion flames are discussed in detail. The correlations of the average particle size and soot volume fraction of the flames with the oxygen/carbon ratio and the OESI of the fuel blends are investigated and explained."
7,Sooting propensity of oxygenated fuel blends,"3.1 Sooting propensity of oxygenated fuel blends Figure 3 shows the smoke point (SP) measurements as a function of the volumetric percentage and mole percentage of the oxygenated fuel in the Jet A2 blends. The SP measurements of all the fuel blends are reported in Section A3 of the Supplementary Material. The standard error of the SP measurements over five repeats are reported as error bars. The Jet A2 flame was determined to have a SP of 25.0 mm, consistent with the literature value [102]. There is a positive correlation between the SP and the proportion of the oxygenated fuels in Jet A2. It is clear that the addition of the oxygenated fuels suppresses the formation of soot in the flame. Figure 3(a) shows no significant differences between the oxygenated fuel blends relative to the size of the error bars at each volumetric blend strength. However, Figure 3(b) shows that differences can be observed between the oxygenated fuel blends at the same mole percentage. Among all the oxygenated fuels, PODE 3 is most effective at reducing the sooting tendency when blended with Jet A2, followed by DMC, DMM and EtOH. The differences between the SP of the oxygenated fuel blends broadens as the mole percentage of the oxygenated fuel in the blend increases. The trend is related to and reflected in the molecular weight (MW) of the oxygenated fuels. The change in the MW of the oxygenated fuel alters the amount of oxygen required to diffuse into the flame for complete combustion of one mole of the fuel [91]. Consequently, the flame length and SP will be affected. PODE 3 (MW = 136 g/mol), which has the largest MW amongst the oxygenated fuels studied has the largest increase in the SP, followed by DMC (MW = 90 g/mol), DMM (MW = 76 g/mol) and EtOH (MW = 46 g/mol). The broadening of the SP measurements between the fuel blends is due to the increasing influence of the MW of the oxygenated fuels at increasing blend strength. Notably, the importance of considering the differences in the MW (and the molecular structure) of the fuels in understanding the sooting tendency has been highlighted and verified [92]. The SP measurements do not account for the molecular composition of the fuel blends [91] and, for this reason, subsequent analyses are performed using OESI in place of SP [91,93]. Figure 4 shows the OESI of the flames against the volumetric percentage, mole percentage and oxygen content of the fuel blends. The error bars were calculated using an error propagation method [94]. See Section A1 of the Supplementary Material for details. Figure 4(a) and (b) show that low blend strengths (5 vol.%) of the oxygenated fuels cause a strong reduction in sooting tendency (i.e. OESI). At higher blending strengths (10 vol.% and 20 vol.%) of the oxygenated fuels, a weaker linear reduction in sooting tendency is observed. Interestingly, the data in Fig. 4(b) is grouped more tightly than Fig. 4(a). The first observation suggests that significant suppression of the soot can be achieved even with low blend strengths of oxygenated fuels. The second observation suggests that increasing the blend strength of oxygenated fuels with Jet A2 could be used to further decrease the sooting tendency (i.e. OESI). Figure 4 (c) shows the OESI plotted against the oxygen content of fuel mixtures. It is observed that the fuel blends with DMM, PODE 3 and DMC have OESIs that are tightly correlated. They have similar molecular structures, i.e. rather than having carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds, they have carbon-oxygen-carbon (C-O-C) bonds where the oxygen-containing functional groups are embedded within their skeletal structures. However, EtOH has a distinctively different structure from DMM, PODE 3 and DMC. EtOH contains a C-C bond and has an oxygenated functional group that is not embedded within its skeletal structure. These observations suggest that whilst the oxygen content of the fuel blend correlates with the reduction in sooting tendency, it is not the sole factor. The effect of the molecular structure is also important in understanding the sooting tendency of the fuel blends. The decrease in the sooting tendency (OESI) arises due to a combination of effects. A dilution effect arises due to the substitution of a more sooty fuel (Jet A2) with a less sooty fuel (oxygenated fuels). A chemical effect arises due to the chemistry of the new component (oxygenated fuel) in the fuel blend. Both may also be accompanied by a correlated temperature effect as a result of the lower energy density of oxygenated fuels versus hydrocarbon fuels [25]. Studies of similar flames [40,61,97,103,104] suggest that the effect of temperature will be small, especially for EtOH, DMM and PODE 3 . The DMC-doped flame is expected to have a larger temperature effect than the other flames due to the formation of carbon dioxide during the decomposition of DMC [105]. This will result in a decrease in flame temperature [61,106,107], however the overall effect is still expected to be small – of the order 50 K [61]. The tight correlation of OESI with the mol.% of all the oxygenated fuels in Fig. 4(b), and to a lesser extent with the vol.% of oxygenated fuel in Fig. 4(a), shows the extent of dilution effect. In contrast, the relationship between the OESI and the oxygen content of the fuel blend in Fig. 4(c) shows the extent of the chemical effect. Given the tight correlation of the data for the DMC, DMM and PODE 3 flames in both plots, we believe that either there is no significant temperature effect, or the effect is equivalent between the different fuels. Comparison of Fig. 4(b) and (c) shows that while there is a strong chemical effect associated with EtOH, the dilution effect has a stronger influence on sooting tendency than the chemical effect for the current fuel blends, even for EtOH. This is consistent with other studies, where the dilution effect has also been observed to have a stronger influence than the chemical effect on the soot-suppressing behaviour of C4 and C5 oxygenated fuels [104]."
8,Soot volume fraction of oxygenated fuel blends,"3.2 Soot volume fraction of oxygenated fuel blends Figure 5 shows the spatial distribution of the soot volume fraction, f v , obtained from colour-ratio pyrometry of the flames. The mixture strength (volumetric percentage of oxygenated fuels in Jet A2) is indicated at the top of each image. The maximum soot volume fraction in the wing of the flame is indicated at the bottom of each image. This discussion focuses on the maximum soot volume fraction which occurs in the wing of the flame [71]. In addition, it is noted that colour-ratio pyrometry works best in optically thin flames, and that the values of the soot volume fraction in the wings (optically thinner) will have better resolution than at the centre-line of the flame (optically thick) [77,108]. There are no comparable values of the soot volume fraction of jet fuel flames in a SP lamp available in the literature. However, in the current work, the observed values of the soot volume fraction values (0–10 ppm) are consistent with soot volume fraction values (0–12 ppm) of biodiesel/diesel flames in a SP lamp measured using laser-induced incandescence [71]. The Jet A2 flame was observed to have a maximum soot volume fraction of 10.5 ppm in the wing, which was the highest of all the flames studied. The maximum soot volume fraction in the wing of the flame is observed to decrease as the proportion of the oxygenated fuels in the fuel mixture increases. EtOH showed the lowest soot volume fraction, followed by DMC, PODE 3 and DMM for the fuel mixtures with 20% oxygenated fuels. The discussion of the trend will be covered in Section 3.4. There are three key takeaways from the observations in Fig. 5. Firstly, the blending of the oxygenated fuels with jet fuel reduces the production of the soot. Secondly, the degree of the reduction of the soot volume fraction is dependent on the types of the oxygenated fuels involved in the blending. Thirdly, EtOH causes a greater reduction in the soot volume fraction than DMC, DMM and PODE 3 ."
9,Soot particle size distribution of oxygenated fuel blends,"3.3 Soot particle size distribution of oxygenated fuel blends Figure 6 shows the particle size distribution (PSD) at the tip of the oxygenated fuel-Jet A2 flames. The standard errors of that PSDs are reported as error bars over five repeats. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first time the PSDs at the tip of the flame have been reported in the literature for this flame configuration using jet fuel blended with oxygenated fuels. Comparable data are therefore not available for the current measurements. As the blend strength of the oxygenated fuels increases (so inducing a decrease in sooting tendency), there is a change from unimodal to bimodal PSDs and a shift towards smaller particle sizes. The additional mode appears on the left of the PSDs in the size range 10 nm to 30 nm. The appearance of the mode of small particles is followed by a decrease in the size and number density of the other particles. This is most obvious in the case of the 20% fuel blends with PODE 3 and DMC, which have the highest oxygen/carbon (O/C) ratio (at 1.1 and 1.3, respectively). A similar behaviour has also been observed in engines [109]. The increased formation of smaller particles when oxygenated fuels are added to Jet A2 can directly increase the proportion of ultrafine particles (PM 0.1 ). This is significant because these particles can be harmful to health and the environment [6,7]. The change from unimodal to bimodal PSDs (with an appearance of a mode of small particles) is believed to be due to oxidation. The 10% fuel blends (circles in Fig. 6) all, to different extents, show a mode of small particles that is not present in the base flame. This mode is less apparent with the 5% fuel blends (squares in Fig. 6) because the oxidation effect is weaker at lower blend strengths (except for EtOH, with its non-embedded oxygenated functional group). Likewise, the 20% fuel blends (triangles in Fig. 6) all show more advanced oxidation because the oxidation effect is stronger at higher blend strengths. This is manifested as a decrease in the overall particle number density, a shift of the PSD to the left and a decrease in the particle number density of the smaller mode of particles. The extent of the effect on the smaller mode varies because the different oxygenated fuels in the different flames affects the relative strength of the oxidation. In the case of EtOH, the mode has been fully consumed. In other flames, the PSD is at an intermediate state where the mode is depleted, but not yet fully consumed. Analogous behaviour has been seen in coflow diffusion ethylene flames doped with PODE 3 [97], where the formation of the mode of small particles and the accompanying leftward shift of the size distribution and decrease in the number density was observed as a function of the height above burner."
10,Correlations of soot measurements to fuel blend oxygen/carbon ratio,"3.4 Correlations of soot measurements to fuel blend oxygen/carbon ratio Figure 7 (a) shows the percentage decrease in the soot volume fraction in the wings of the flames versus the oxygen/carbon (O/C) ratio of the fuel mixtures. The increase in the O/C ratio of the fuel mixtures reduces the maximum soot volume fraction ( f v ) in the wing of the flame. Notably, the oxygenated fuels each exhibit a different extent of reduction in the maximum soot volume fraction. The EtOH-Jet A2 flames show the largest decrease in soot volume fraction, followed by the DMC, PODE 3 and DMM-Jet A2 flames. It is suggested that this trend is related to the molecular structure of the oxygenated fuels, where the oxygenated functional groups of DMC, PODE 3 and DMM are all embedded within their molecular structure. This may reduce the availability of oxygen species to participate in soot reduction reactions. In contrast, the EtOH-Jet A2 flames have the highest reduction in soot volume fraction, possibly because the hydroxyl functional group in EtOH is not embedded within its molecular structure and can produce hydroxyl radicals during the pyrolysis of EtOH in the flame. The main decomposition pathways of the oxygenated fuels and their impact on soot formation are discussed below. A diagram showing a summary of the decomposition pathways is included in Section A4 of the Supplementary Material. The major decomposition pathway of EtOH in fuel-rich conditions is by dehydration, resulting in the formation of water [23]. The water produced in flames has been reported to inhibit soot formation via the production of hydroxyl radicals from the reaction H 2 O + . H ↔ . OH + H 2 [110]. The hydroxyl radicals can oxidise soot precursors and soot [111], reducing the overall rate of soot production [112,113]. DMC predominantly decomposes via a decarboxylation reaction under pyrolysis and diffusion flame conditions, resulting in the formation of carbon dioxide. Experiments using ethylene and propane diffusion flames have shown that the addition of carbon dioxide inhibits the conversion of PAHs to soot [114]. Comparison of DMC-doped and DMM-doped ethylene coflow diffusion flames [61] and opposed flow diffusion propane flames [106] show results consistent with Fig. 7(a), where DMC results in lower soot volume fractions and soot precursors than DMM, with both studies attributing this effect to the formation of additional carbon dioxide in the DMC flames. DMM [115] and PODE 3 [116–118] (both poly-ethers) are expected to have similar major decomposition pathways, producing formaldehyde (proportional to the chain length of the poly-ether), methoxy radicals and methyl radicals. Formaldehyde and methoxy radicals can lead to the formation of carbon monoxide, which can reduce the contribution of those species in the formation of soot precursors [57,115,118]. However, methyl radicals can contribute to soot formation, for example via the hydrogen-abstraction-methyl-addition (HAMA) mechanism [119,120]. The HAMA mechanism can occur favourably on alkyl chains [119,120], which could be significant in Jet A2 because half of it is composed of paraffins [79]. The importance of methyl radicals in soot precursor and soot formation has also been shown in dimethyl ether [121–124] and methanol [23,57] flames. In the current investigation, the DMM blend would produce more methyl radicals than the PODE 3 blend at the same O/C ratio because DMM is the shorter poly-ether. This is consistent with Fig. 7(a), where DMM is more sooting than PODE 3 . The findings are consistent with the comparison of the formation of soot precursors from the combustion of C 2 H 6 O isomers: ethanol ( C 2 H 5 OH ) and dimethyl ether ( CH 3 OCH 3 ) [53,125]. Both were able to reduce the formation of soot precursors in premixed laminar flame [125] and flow reactor [53] due to the increased proportion of oxygenated species in the system [53,125]. Despite the fact that the C 2 H 6 O isomers have the same oxygen content, the differences in their oxygen-containing functional groups and hence their fuel-specific decomposition pathways were identified to influence the formation of the soot precursors and oxygenated air pollutants [125]. This was also clear where the amount of the soot precursor (benzene) formed in laminar coflow diffusion flames was lower when ethylene was doped with EtOH as opposed to dimethyl ether [40]. Similarly, in mixtures with the same O/C ratio, the C 4 H 10 O isomers (diethyl ether and butanol) were found to produce soot precursors in laminar premixed low-pressure flames based on the number of C-C bonds and the type of oxygenated functional groups in their molecular structure rather than their oxygen content [126]. The observations show that whilst the reduction in soot volume fraction is broadly correlated with the O/C ratio of fuel blends, the type of oxygenated fuels may also play a significant role in influencing the soot volume fraction in flames. Figure 7 (b) shows the percentage reduction in the average particle size at the tip of the flame versus the oxygen/carbon (O/C) ratio of fuel blends. The reduction in the average particle size at the tip of the flame is broadly correlated with the O/C ratio, however the uncertainties in the measurements are too large to draw any firm conclusions about the differences in behaviour between the different fuels. The initial addition of the oxygenated fuels has a disproportionate effect on the soot volume fraction in the wing of the flame, and to a lesser extent on the average particle size at the tip of the flame. Figure 7 shows the strongest reduction in both at low blend strengths (i.e. low O/C ratio), after which the reduction, in particular in the soot volume fraction in the wings, levels off at high blend strengths (i.e. high O/C ratio). This is because the initial introduction of the oxygenated fuels changes the combustion environment from that of a pure diffusion flame to a partially premixed flame. This can have a non-uniform effect on the pyrolysis mechanism [127–129] and is known to affect flames with oxygenated fuel blends [130]. The dilution effect will also play a role and it is expected to have a non-linear effect, particularly at low blend strengths (because soot precursors are formed via non-linear reactions). At higher blend strengths the effect of the additional oxygenated fuel is incremental, resulting in a ‘levelling off’ behaviour that has also been observed in the literature [104,131]."
11,Correlations of soot measurements to oxygen extended sooting index,"3.5 Correlations of soot measurements to oxygen extended sooting index Figure 8 shows the maximum soot volume fraction in the wing of the flame and the average particle size at the tip of the flame versus the oxygen extended sooting index (OESI). It is believed that this is the first time that these quantities have been reported. As shown in Fig. 8(a), the maximum soot volume fraction in the wing of the flame for all the oxygenated fuels broadly correlates with the OESI for all the oxygenated fuels. A closer inspection of the trends from the figure suggests that there are minute differences between the oxygenated fuels studied. DMM and PODE 3 are both poly-ether compounds with different oxygenated fuel oxygen content (42% and 47%, respectively). They exhibit trends that are correlated to their oxygen content, i.e. lower oxygen content shows a smaller decrease in maximum soot volume fraction with the decrease in OESI. PODE 3 , DMC and EtOH have different oxygen-containing functional groups and oxygen content. However, they show a similar decrease in the maximum soot volume fraction with the decrease in OESI. The effect of oxygen content seems to be significant for the poly-ether compounds, but not DMC and EtOH. Nonetheless, OESI showed strong correlation with the maximum soot volume fraction measurements with only small differences between the fuels studied. The findings are consistent with studies on mono-ethers (DME, DEE and DBE) [126,132,133]. The oxygen content of the mono-ethers were varied by changing the number of C-C bonds. The corresponding oxygen content of DME, DEE and DBE are 35%, 22% and 12%, respectively. The mono-ether with the highest oxygen content (DME) produced the least amount of soot precursors, followed by DEE and DBE [132], similar to the trend of the maximum soot volume fraction measurements observed for poly-ethers in the current study. Additionally, in PODE 3 -blended premixed ethylene/air flame, the oxygen that was embedded within the molecular structure of the PODE 3 was found to be effective in reducing the total number of soot precursors and hence the overall amount of soot formed [30]. As shown in Fig. 8(b), the average particle size at tip of the flame for all the oxygenated fuel-Jet A2 blends also correlate well with the OESI. However, there are differences between the different fuel blends. The DMM and EtOH-Jet A2 flames show a smaller decrease in average particle size with the decrease in OESI compared with DMC and PODE 3 -Jet A2 flames. The split is consistent with the observations in Fig. 6 and may be linked to the O/C ratio of the oxygenated fuels (PODE 3 and DMC at 1.1 and 1.3 versus EtOH and DMM at 0.7 and 0.9, respectively). The correlations observed in Fig. 8(b) suggest that OESI can also be useful to correlate average particle size in flames. However, there may also be some dependencies on the O/C ratio of the fuel blend."
12,Conclusions,"An ASTM D1322 smoke point lamp was used to investigate the sooting behaviour of oxygenated fuel-Jet A2 blends. Dimethyl carbonate (DMC), dimethoxymethane (DMM), ethanol (EtOH) and polyoxymethylene dimethyl ether 3 (PODE 3 ) were blended with Jet A2 at volumetric percentages up to 20%. The sooting tendency of the fuel mixtures was determined using the smoke point procedure. The soot volume fraction and the particle size distribution (PSD) were measured using colour-ratio pyrometry and differential mobility spectrometry, respectively. The data were analysed to investigate the factors affecting the sooting tendency of oxygenated fuel-Jet A2 blends and to explore the correlations of the PSD and soot volume fraction with OESI. The soot volume fraction was measured using colour-ratio pyrometry and is reported for the wings of the flame. The PSD was measured using differential mobility spectrometry with samples taken from the tip of the flame. The choice of both locations maximises the accuracy of the measurements. The data were analysed to investigate the factors affecting the sooting tendency of oxygenated fuel-Jet A2 blends and to explore the correlations of the PSD and soot volume fraction with OESI. The different fuel blends affect the combustion chemistry and soot formation throughout the flame. The observations of the relative effects of the different blends are therefore expected to be independent of the particular choice of sampling location. The addition of the oxygenated fuel in Jet A2 was found to reduce the sooting tendency of the fuel mixtures. The sooting tendency was calculated using the oxygen extended sooting index (OESI). The OESI was found to be negatively correlated with the volumetric percentage, the mole percentage and the oxygen content of the oxygenated fuel-Jet A2 blends, with mole percentage showing a tighter correlation than volumetric percentage. The fuel blends containing EtOH showed a significantly greater reduction in OESI than the other fuel blends when plotted against the oxygen content of the fuel blend, suggesting that oxygen content is insufficient in explaining all of the effect of the oxygenated fuel blend. The molecular structure of the oxygenated fuel is also important, and a marked difference was observed in the behaviour of the fuels with and without embedded oxygenated functional groups. The soot volume fraction in the wing of the flame and the average particle size at the tip of the flame were analysed versus the oxygen/carbon (O/C) ratio of the fuel mixture. The percentage reduction in soot volume fraction in the wing of the flame was proportional to the O/C ratio of the fuel mixture. The extent of reduction was the largest for EtOH, followed by DMC, PODE 3 and DMM. Although EtOH has the lowest O/C ratio, it has an non-embedded oxygenated functional group. The effect of this is that the oxygenated functional group (hydroxyl) is more readily accessible to react with soot and soot precursors to promote soot reduction. In the case of DMC, PODE 3 and DMM, the oxygen is embedded within the carbon-oxygen-carbon skeletal structure. This suggests that the reduction in the soot volume fraction in the wing of the flame is also significantly influenced by the molecular structure of the oxygenated fuel. Meanwhile, the percentage reduction in the average particle size at the tip of the flame was found to be broadly proportional to the O/C ratio, but with no discernible differences between the different fuels. The soot volume fraction in the wing of the flame and the average particle size at the tip of the flame were observed to correlate broadly with the OESI of the fuel mixtures. In the case of the poly-ethers (DMM and PODE 3 ), the soot volume fraction was observed also to depend on their oxygen content. In contrast, average particle size at the tip of the flame was observed also to depend on the O/C ratio of the fuel blend. Although there are slight differences in the correlations between the oxygenated fuels, the broad correlations indicate that the OESI obtained using the smoke point procedure can be used to infer the approximate soot volume fraction and average particle size measured in flames. In this work, we have demonstrated for the first time that the average particle size and the soot volume fraction (measured with an easily implemented technique such as colour-ratio pyrometry) can be determined via correlations with the sooting tendency measurements. This is significant because the aviation industry can use these correlations to support the evaluation of the capability of new Sustainable Aviation Fuel blends to meet the particulate matter standards that will be introduced by regulators in the coming future."
