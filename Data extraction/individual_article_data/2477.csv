0,Introduction,"The environmental impact of human activities due to technological progress has dramatically changed the world. The great dependence of the modern society on non-renewable energy sources such as oil, coal and natural gas has led to the fast depletion of these energy sources and resulted in large greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the atmosphere. These have significantly contributed to joint efforts to develop sustainable and/or renewable fuel sources, such as solar, wind and biomass-based energy (Chandra et al., 2012). A renewable raw material source that can be used for bioenergy production is lignocellulosic biomass. Lignocellulosic biomass is a source of pentoses (C5) and hexoses (C6) that can be further used as a substrate for the production of different types of liquid and/or gaseous biofuels (Kaparaju et al., 2009b). Sugarcane, one of the main crops cultivated in Brazil (561milliontons/year), after being crushed in sugar and alcohol plants produces from 140 to 157milliontons/year of bagasse with 50% humidity. Generally, sugarcane bagasse is fed into the boilers and burned to generate steam and bioelectricity for the plant. However, some reports from literature have shown that the energetic demand of a sugar and alcohol plant is met by burning only half of the available bagasse (Turdera, 2013). Thus, bagasse surplus may be used to produce biofuels and high value-added products. The complex structure of the lignocellulosic biomass hampers its use as a feedstock material for bioenergy production due to its recalcitrance. Therefore, it needs to be subjected to a pretreatment step. When the pretreatment step is effective, it is able to extract hemicelluloses, remove lignin, reduce cellulose crystallinity and increase its surface area. The hydrothermal treatment process, commonly referred to as autohydrolysis (AH), is a physicochemical process in which lignocellulosic biomass is pretreated with liquid hot water at high pressure, thereby breaking down hemicellulose chains and allowing the solubilization of pentoses, hexoses and uronic acids. Biomass exposure to autohydrolysis also allows the release of acetyl groups from hemicelluloses, thereby producing acetic acid that is responsible to decrease the pH of the reaction medium, which increases the rate of hemicelluloses depolymerization (Ruiz et al., 2012). Thus, AH pretreatment yields a liquid fraction, so-called hemicellulose hydrolysate (HH), that is rich in monosaccharides and xylooligomers, as well as a solid fraction partially delignified and rich in cellulose that could be further used as a substrate for second generation (2G) bioethanol production via yeast fermentation (Buruiana et al., 2014). However, it is known that the AH pretreatment of lignocellulosic residues has disadvantages such as the high energy requirements and generation of a HH rich in fermentable C5 sugars (mainly xylose and arabinose) containing toxic compounds such as 2-furfuraldehyde (FF) and 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfuraldehyde (HMF) (Santucci et al., 2015; Vallejos et al., 2012). These toxic compounds inhibit the growing of microorganisms, thereby limiting the use of the HH. Another alternative to harvest energy from HH is the production of methane via anaerobic digestion (AD). Most of the studies available in the literature reports that the low methane production rates are associated to the presence of toxic compounds such as aromatics, soluble lignin fragments (SL) and furans (FF and HMF) in the HH (Bolado-Rodriguez et al., 2016; Costa et al., 2014). An alternative that can be used to promote the detoxification of the HH, increasing the biomethane production rate, is the spatial separation of the acidogenic and methanogenic stages. As the acidogenic microorganisms are known to have higher growth rates when compared to methanogenic microorganisms, the adoption of the acidogenic stage before the methanogenic stage may promote the conversion of the C5 sugars and other soluble compounds, e.g. FF, HMF and SL, present in the HH into volatile fatty acid (VFA), whereas the further conversion of the VFA into methane and carbon dioxide would take place in the methanogenic stage. Studies published so far have evaluated the optimal process conditions, fermenter set-up and the effects of the operational variables on the degree of substrate degradation in two-stage, i.e. hydrogen production followed by methane production from wastewater as well as from food and agricultural wastes (Arreola-Vargas et al., 2016; Lindner et al., 2016). However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no study in the literature evaluating the influence of acidogenic stage on methane yield from HH obtained by AH pretreatment of SB. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of hydrogen and methane production in a two-stage batch system (acidogenic-methanogenic) fed with HH obtained from four different AH conditions employed for SB pretreatment. In addition, it was investigated the influence of the HH composition on the hydrogen and methane production rates and the capacity of the acidogenic stage to work as a biodetoxification step. Using a biorefinery concept, it was also evaluated the capacity of power generation from burning the hydrogen and methane produced at the best scenario."
1,Material and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Cyclohexane and ethanol (99.5%) were purchased from Synth (Brazil). Both sulfuric acids (95–98% and 99.999%) were purchased from Synth and Sigma-Aldrich (Brazil), respectively. Chromatography-grade standards cellobiose, d-glucose, d-xylose, l-arabinose, acetic acid, formic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, isovaleric acid, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfuraldehyde (HMF), and 2-furfuraldehyde (FF) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Brazil)."
3,Sugarcane bagasse preparation,"2.2 Sugarcane bagasse preparation SB was provided by Jatiboca Sugar and Ethanol Plant (Ponte Nova, MG, Brazil), and was collected in the 2012/2013 season. Whole SB was subjected to a washing process using distilled water at 70°C for 1h under mechanical stirring. This step was planned to remove residual sugars from the sugarcane crushing process. After that, the SB was stored at temperatures below 0°C until further processing."
4,Characterization of SB and hemicellulose hydrolysates,"2.3 Characterization of SB and hemicellulose hydrolysates An oven dried sample of SB was milled in a Wiley mill (Marconi, model MA048) and the fraction retained by the 40-mesh screen was used for the compositional tests. A SB sample was taken to determine the ash (inorganic) content according to the method “Ash in wood, pulp, paper and paperboard”, TAPPI T211 om–02. The quantitative determination of SB extractives was carried out by Soxhlet extraction using cyclohexane/ethanol (1:1, v/v) as a solvent mixture in agreement with the method “Solvent Extractives of Wood and Pulp”, TAPPI T204cm–07 with minor modification. An extractive-free SB sample was taken to determine the acid–insoluble lignin content, in accordance with the test method “Determination of acid-insoluble lignin in biomass”, NREL LAP-004. The concentration of sugars (cellobiose, glucose, xylose and arabinose), sugar degradation products (FF and HMF) and organic acids (acetic and formic acids) in the hydrolysate resulting from the determination of acid–insoluble lignin in SB was used to calculate the contents of cellulose and hemicelluloses. Additionally, such analyses were also used to characterize the liquid fractions (HH) produced by AH pretreatment of SB under different conditions. The coefficients used to convert sugars, sugar degradation products and organic acids into cellulose and hemicelluloses were those described by Gurgel et al. (2014). The concentration of sugars and sugar degradation products was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in agreement with the test method “Determination of carbohydrates in biomass by high performance liquid chromatography”, NREL LAP-002. A Shimadzu HPLC system equipped with a refractive index detector (Shimadzu, model RID-6A) and an Aminex HPX 87H column (300×7.8mm Bio-Rad) kept at 55°C (Shimadzu, model CTO-30A) was used for determining the HH composition. The chromatographic conditions used for separating the compounds in the HH involved the use of sulfuric acid (5mmol·L−1) as an eluent at a flow rate of 0.6mL·min−1. The concentration of organic acids (formic, acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric, valeric and isovaleric), FF and HMF was also determined using the same chromatographic conditions previously described. However, the detection of these chemical compounds was performed in a UV–Vis detector (Shimadzu, model SPD–10AV) at the wavelength of 210nm for organic acids and 274nm for FF and HMF. The concentration of total organic carbon (TOC) in the HH from AH pretreatment was determined using a TOC–L CPH/CPN Shimadzu equipment. The biogas production was monitored until stabilization of the anaerobic reactors and the gas composition was measured by gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC, model 2014/TCD) equipped with CP-Molsieve 5A and CP Pora BOND Q columns, using nitrogen as the carrier gas. All analyses were performed in triplicate."
5,Autohydrolysis pretreatment (AH) of SB,"2.4 Autohydrolysis pretreatment (AH) of SB AH pretreatment of SB was performed in a tubular reactor made of 316L stainless steel (190mm of height×58mm of internal diameter×76mm of external diameter) with a volume capacity of 195cm3. The experimental conditions of AH pretreatment used in this study were the same previously described and optimized by Baeta et al. (2016) for methane production as shown in Supplementary Table 1. The water content of SB was taken into account only in the mass balances. The vessel reactor was loaded with 30.0g of SB, on dry-weight basis, and distilled water to give solid-to-liquid ratios described in Supplementary Table 1. The reactor was heated in a 25L thermostatically controlled bath containing glycerol as a heating fluid. The temperatures set were programmed and controlled with the aid of a thermocouple. After the end of the AH pretreatment, the vessel reactor was immediately cooled in an ice bath and opened. Then, the pretreated SB was dewatered in a hydraulic press by applying a pressure of 9 tons (SOLAB®, model SL-10). The HH recovered after pressing the pretreated SB was collected, stored in a freezer (−20°C) and characterized for its composition in terms of monosaccharides (glucose, xylose and arabinose), sugar degradation products (FF and HMF), organic acids (acetic and formic acids), soluble lignin (SL) and total organic carbon (TOC), as previously described. After the compositional characterization, part of the HH was submitted to acidogenic-methanogenic anaerobic biodegradability tests to evaluate their biochemical hydrogen potential (BHP) and biochemical methane potential (BMP). The pretreated SB (solid fraction) was dried (without washing with water after pressing) in a forced air circulation oven at 85°C for 24h, transferred to a desiccator to cool, and then weighed until a constant weight was obtained. The weight loss (WL) was gravimetrically determined and the hemicelluloses removal (HR) was estimated by using Eq. (1). (1) HR / % = HC SB - HC AH - SB Y AH - SB / 100 HC SB × 100 where HR is hemicelluloses removal (%), HC AH-SB and HC SB are hemicellulose contents in SB after and before AH pretreatment, respectively and Y AH-SB (%) is the yield of AH pretreatment (Y =100− WL)."
6,Acidogenic biodegradability of the hemicellulose hydrolysate,"2.5 Acidogenic biodegradability of the hemicellulose hydrolysate Batch acidogenic anaerobic digestion tests were performed in triplicate to assess the BHP and to evaluate the ability of the acidogenic microorganisms to act as biodetoxification agents of the HH obtained from different AH pretreatment conditions of SB. A control test, without addition of a substrate, was also included in the tests to evaluate the hydrogen activity of the inoculum. All experiments were performed at mesophilic conditions in 275mL glass bottles that were subsequently placed into a thermostatic orbital shaker (35.1±0.3°C) at 200rpm. The volume of HH used in each glass bottle was 15mL and the total liquid volume in the glass bottles was 150mL, ensuring a 125mL headspace volume. The amount of inoculum used in each test depended on the total organic carbon (TOC) concentration of each hydrolysate in order to keep a food-to-microorganism ratio of 1.85gTOC·gVSS−1 as reported by Lazaro et al. (2014). The initial pH value in each flask was maintained at 5.5 by adding drops of aqueous HCl (1.5mol·L−1) or NaOH (1.5mol·L−1) solutions when necessary. In addition, a macro- and micronutrient solution was added to the glass bottles as suggested by Fangkum and Reungsang (2011). The acidogenic anaerobic inoculum used for the acidogenic tests was taken from a pilot-scale mesophilic anaerobic digester that had been feeding with raw sewage installed at the Centre for Research and Training on Sanitation (CePTS) UFMG/Copasa (Arrudas Wastewater Treatment Plant, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil) and mixed with cow dung in a ratio of 1:1 (w/w) on dry-weight basis. A heat treatment (90°C for 10min) was used to eliminate the hydrogen consuming methanogens and to enrich the inoculum with hydrogen producing microorganisms such as Clostridium sp. After thermal treatment, the inoculum was kept at pH ∼5.5 and fed weekly with an aqueous xylose solution (1.0g/L). Before the acidogenic tests the inoculum was pre-incubated for seven days at 35°C in order to offset the hydrogen production from the biodegradation of any residual organic matter. Samples from the batch reactors were collected at the beginning and end of the experiments to determine TOC and VFA concentration. After the acidogenic stage, the acidogenic conversion efficiency (AE) for each condition was estimated by Eq. (2) as follows: (2) AE / % = TOC VFA TOC substrate × 100 where AE is the percentage of total organic carbon fed converted into VFA; TOC VFA is the amount of total organic carbon present in the form of VFA at the end of the acidogenic stage; and TOC substrate is the amount of TOC fed at the beginning of the acidogenic test. The theoretical amount of total organic carbon contained in each VFA (e.g. 24g of carbon per mol of acetic acid) was used to calculate this parameter."
7,Evaluation of biochemical methane potential,"2.6 Evaluation of biochemical methane potential After the acidogenic anaerobic tests, each glass bottle was opened and the liquid fraction remaining was separated from the acidogenic inoculum (solid phase) by centrifugation at 3600rpm for 15min. A part of the liquid fraction (effluent) was stored for further compositional characterization (amount of C5-C6 sugars, VFA, FF, HMF and TOC), whereas another part (∼15mL) was used for the methanogenic tests. Batch methanogenic anaerobic tests were performed in triplicate to assess the BMP of the liquid fraction resulting from the acidogenic tests. A control test, without the addition of a substrate, was also run to evaluate the methanogenic activity of the inoculum. All experiments were performed at mesophilic conditions at 35°C in 275mL glass bottles that were placed into a thermostatic orbital shaker under the same conditions previously described for the acidogenic tests. The liquid volume of each glass bottle was 150mL, ensuring a 125mL of headspace. The anaerobic inoculum used for the BMP tests was also taken from CePTS UFMG/Copasa. The inoculum was also pre-incubated for four days at 35°C in order to offset the methane production from biodegradation of any residual organic matter. The amount of inoculum used depended on the total organic carbon (TOC) concentration remaining in the liquid fraction (effluent) of each acidogenic test in order to keep a food-to-microorganism ratio of 0.4g TOC·gVSS−1. An amount of aqueous NaHCO3 buffer solution was added to yield a concentration of 5.0g/L in each glass bottle along with an amount of nutrients to obtain a solution with the following constituents and their respective concentrations (in g/L): NH4Cl (0.28), K2HPO4 (0.25), MgSO4·7H2O (0.10), CaCl2·2H2O (0.01) and CaCO3(0.60). Additionally, 150μL of a solution containing the following trace elements with their respective concentrations (in mg/L) was added to each glass bottle: FeCl2·4H2O (2000), H3BO3 (50), ZnCl2 (50), CuCl2·2H2O (38), MnCl2·4H2O (500), (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (50), AlCl3·6H2O (90) and CoCl2·6H2O (2000) (Costa et al., 2014). At the end of the methanogenic tests, samples were collected to determine TOC and VFA concentration. All values of BHP and BMP (Nm3·kgTOC−1) were expressed at standard temperature and pressure conditions (STP: 273K and 101,315Pa) as recommended by IUPAC (International Union of Pure Applied Chemistry). The BHP and BMP tests were finished when the daily hydrogen and methane production was less than 1% of their total accumulation."
8,Modeling the experimental data,"2.7 Modeling the experimental data The cumulative hydrogen and methane production data from the acidogenic and methanogenic experiments were fitted to a modified Gompertz model Eq. (3) (Lay, 2000) or to a first-order kinetic model Eq. (4). The validity of the models was checked by the determination coefficient (R 2) as well as by assessing their errors by the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD). After the statistical analysis, the modified Gompertz model was considered the best model to represent the acidogenic experimental data. The maximum accumulated hydrogen production (P) was then calculated by nonlinear sigmoidal regression analysis of the experimental data using Eq. (3) as follows: (3) P / mmol = P exp - exp Re P ( λ - t ) + 1 where P is the hydrogen production potential (mmolH2), R is the maximum hydrogen production rate (mmolH2 h−1), λ is the lag phase time (days) and e is exp(1). The kinetics of methane production in the methanogenic tests was calculated using a first-order kinetic model (Eq. (4)), which have been successfully applied in other studies of anaerobic biodegradability of lignocellulosic biomass such as wheat straw (Ferreira et al., 2013, 2014). (4) B / mmol = B 0 1 - exp ( - k h t ) where B is the CH4 production (mmol), B 0 is commonly used to estimate the reaction extent (related to the substrate biodegradability) and the k h (mmolCH4·d−1) is the kinetic rate constant of the methanogenic process, which could be used in a kinetic global model such as ADM1 to predict the performance of the anaerobic digestion. The specific maximum hydrogen (R SH2) or methane (R SCH4) production rate (Nm3·gTOCadded·d−1) was obtained dividing R in the case of hydrogen (Eq. (3)) and B 0.k h in the case of methane (Eq. (4)) by the fed TOC. In both cases, it was necessary to make the unit conversion from mmol to Nm3, considering STP conditions (273.15K and 101,315Pa)."
9,Energy balance,"2.8 Energy balance Energy balance for each condition was estimated considering the amount of energy generated (E+) from the combustion (90% efficiency) of hydrogen (ΔH combustion =10.8MJ·Nm−3 H2) and methane (ΔH combustion =34.5MJ·Nm−3 CH4) produced at the BMP and BHP tests. The energy expenditure during the AH pretreatment (E−) was considered to calculate the net energy gain (ΔE) of the process. In order to calculate the energy expenditure, the solid-to-liquid ratio (SLR) used in each condition as well as the temperature of the pretreatment (T AH) and temperature for inlet material, i.e. SB (T SB,inlet =25°C) and water (TH2O , inlet =100°C), were considered. Inlet water at 100°C would be possible considering the use of water from condensing turbines of the cogeneration system in the sugar and alcohol plant. The values of specific heat capacity (C p) used for SB (on dry-weight basis) and water were 1.76×10−3 MJ·(kg°C)−1 and 4.19×10−3 MJ·(kg°C)−1, respectively (Kling et al., 1987). The ΔE was estimated using Eq. (5). (5) Δ E = E ( + ) - E ( - ) Δ E = BHP × Δ H ° comb, H 2 + BMP × Δ H ° comb, CH 4 × TOC Soluble SB dry weight × 0.9 - C p,SB × m SB × T AH,T - T SB,25 ° C + C p, H 2 O × 1 SLR × ρ H 2 O × T AH,T - T H 2 O,100 ° C where the BHP is the biochemical hydrogen potential, BMP is the biochemical methane potential, TOC soluble/SBdry weight is the amount of soluble total organic carbon present in the HH after AH pretreatment per kg of SB, on dry-weight basis and ρH2O is the specific gravity (1.0gcm−3) of water."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Autohydrolysis pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse,"3.1 Autohydrolysis pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse The chemical composition of SB used as a raw material in this study was 44.16% cellulose, 23.61% hemicelluloses, 25.79% lignin, 2.22% extractives and 1.45% ash (inorganics). This composition is in good agreement with that reported by Vallejos et al. (2012). Baeta et al. (2016) optimized the AH pretreatment of SB for methane production through anaerobic digestion. In this study, the independent variables temperature, time and solid-to-liquid ratio were optimized using a Doehlert design. The responses (dependent variables) evaluated were contents of sugar (C5-C6), furans (FF+HMF) and SL in the HH and methane production. According to Baeta et al. (2016), the sugar content in the HH was not the best variable to estimate its methane production potential. Then, these authors used the desirability function of the Statistica® software (Statsoft, Inc.) to determine which hydrolysate composition would lead to highest methane production. Thus, four desirable conditions (DC) were predicted by the software and experimentally validated, and the highest amount of methane (1.56±0.11Nm3 kgTOC−1) was obtained by DC2 condition (178.6°C, 43.6min and SLR =0.24) which led to lower sugar (C5-C6) content (0.57g) in comparison with the other conditions. Baeta et al. (2016) attributed the lower methane production in the other conditions (DC1, DC3 and DC4) to the higher furans and SL contents in the resulting HH, which impaired the methanogenic microorganisms due to their known toxicity. Therefore, a two-stage anaerobic digestion of the HH obtained by desirable conditions (DC1-DC4) was proposed in the present study to biodetoxify the hydrolysate, thereby improving its potential for producing hydrogen and methane. Supplementary Table 1 shows the hydrolysate volume recovered after pressing pretreated SB, the weight of C5-C6 sugars, furans and SL for each AH pretreatment performed according to four desirable conditions proposed by Baeta et al. (2016). The amount of soluble fermentable sugars (C5-C6) released in the HH after AH pretreatment performed at DC1 (1.07g) was higher in comparison to DC2 (0.57g), DC3 (0.94g) and DC4 (0.87g). However, DC1 also presented the higher amounts of furans (0.33g) and SL (2.02g), which are compounds considered as toxic to anaerobic microorganisms. A higher lignin removal efficiency was also observed for DC1 (26.20%) when compared to other conditions, i.e. DC2 (6.34%), DC3 (19.06%) and DC4 (18.62%). These results confirm that higher amounts of SL are present in the HH of condition DC1. A hypothesis to explain such behavior is the combined effect of the variables temperature (185.0°C) and time (55min) for DC1. The combination of these variables at DC1 resulted in higher severity factor (4.25) when compared to conditions DC2 (3.95), DC3 (4.05) and DC4 (4.05). Some authors (Bolado-Rodriguez et al., 2016; Costa et al., 2014; Ferreira et al., 2013) also reported higher amounts of toxic compounds in hydrolysates obtained at AH conditions as severe as those used in this study. The presence of high amounts of lignin soluble fragments in the hydrolysate may hinder its use for hydrogen and methane production through anaerobic digestion."
12,Evaluation of acidogenic biodegradability of the hemicellulose hydrolysates,"3.2 Evaluation of acidogenic biodegradability of the hemicellulose hydrolysates Table 1 shows the concentration of the main compounds contained in the HH at the beginning of the acidogenic anaerobic tests. In order to monitor the efficiency of the acidogenic stage, TOC removal, BHP (Nm3 H2·kgTOC−1) and AE (%) were evaluated for each condition studied (DC1-DC4). In the acidogenic stage no methane production was detected during the fermentation, indicating that thermal treatment of the inoculum was effective, thereby inhibiting methanogenic bacteria. The SB pretreatment at condition DC2 (178.6°C, 43.6min and 0.238g SBdry weight. mLH2O−1) produced a HH which led to the highest hydrogen production capacity (BHP =0.293Nm3 H2·kgTOC−1) as seen in Table 1. This BHP value is very promising when considering those reported by Lazaro et al. (2014), who found a BHP of 0.133Nm3 H2·kgTOC−1 using sugarcane vinasse as a substrate, Jung et al. (2011), who found a BHP of 0.060Nm3 H2·kgTOC−1 using alga (L. japonica) thermally pretreated at 170°C for 20min and Nualsri et al. (2016), who evaluated the BHP for sugarcane juice and obtained a value of 0.373Nm3 H2·kgTOC−1. In order to compare the BHP values reported in the present study with those reported in the literature, it was necessary to convert the units reported in the present study (Nm3 H2·kgTOC−1) to the that used (NLH2·g C5-C6−1) by other authors. The BHP of 0.83 NLH2·g C5-C6−1 found in the present study for HH from DC2 is greater than the value of 0.33NLH2·g C5-C6−1 reported by Pattra et al. (2008) for HH from acid pretreatment (121°C, 61min, SLR =0.06 and 0.5% (v/v) H2SO4) of sugarcane bagasse; than the value of 0.30NLH2·g C5-C6−1 observed by Datar et al. (2007) for HH obtained from steam explosion (220°C and 3min) of corn stover; and the value of 0.21NLH2.g C5-C6−1 reported by Kongjan and Angelidaki (2010) for HH from wheat straw autohydrolysis (180°C and 15min). Thus, the comparison of data obtained in the present study with those reported in the literature, indicates that hydrogen production from hydrolysates of sugarcane bagasse autohydrolysis is promising, especially when coupled to methane production. A hypothesis to explain the greater performance of DC2 condition may be associated to the smaller amounts of toxic compounds (furans and SL) contained in the HH of this condition when compared to other conditions (DC1, DC3 and DC4). For DC1, DC3 and DC4 conditions, the concentrations of SL were higher than 1.0g·L−1, whereas the concentrations of furans (FF+HMF) were always greater than 0.15g·L−1. The results obtained in the present study are in good agreement with those obtained by Siqueira and Reginatto (2015), who showed that furans concentration in the range of 0.2 to 0.5g·L−1 decreased the hydrogen production by 20–35% when compared to a synthetic feed solution containing only glucose as a substrate. These authors also showed that the presence of some lignin derived compounds such as syringaldehyde, vanillin and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, in concentrations varying from 0.250 to 2.0g·L−1, was toxic to hydrogen producing microorganisms and decreased the hydrogen production rate from 30 to 78% (Siqueira and Reginatto, 2015). Fig. 1 a shows that higher concentrations of SL and furans in the HH can negatively affect the specific maximum hydrogen production rate (R SH2). When comparing the values of R SH2 for DC2 condition (0.118Nm3 H2·kgTOC−1 added·d−1) with those obtained for conditions such as DC1 (0.040Nm3 H2·kgTOC−1 added·d−1), DC3 (0.052Nm3 H2·kgTOC−1 added·d−1) and DC4 (0.043Nm3 H2·kgTOC−1 added·d−1) it is possible to notice that the HH produced by conditions DC1 and DC4 were those that had the higher amounts of furans (DC1=0.202g·L−1 and DC4=0.270g·L−1) and SL (DC1=1.24g·L−1 and DC4=1.47g·L−1). These results confirm that larger amounts of furans and SL in the HH compromise the kinetic of hydrogen production from acidogenic microorganisms. Fig. 1a and b shows the specific maximum hydrogen production rate as a function of desirable conditions (DC1-DC4) taking into account the SL, furans and the C5-C6/TTC ratio (fermentable sugars/total toxic compounds as furans plus SL). Furthermore, Fig. 1b shows that the behavior of the specific maximum hydrogen production rate is directly related to the C5-C6/TTC ratio. An increase by 0.538 in the C5-C6/TTC ratio from DC1 to DC2 led to an increase of 0.078Nm3 H2·kgTOC−1 added·d−1 in R SH2. On the other hand, a decrease by 0.314 in the C5-C6/TTC ratio from DC2 to DC3 led to a reduction of 0.066Nm3 H2·kgTOC−1 added·d−1 in the hydrogen production rate, whereas a reduction by 0.295 in the C5-C6/TTC ratio from DC3 to DC4 led to a R SH2 decrease of 0.009Nm3 H2·kgTOC−1 added·d−1. These results suggest that the C5-C6/TTC ratio could be a good estimating parameter of hydrogen production rate when considering the anaerobic digestion of HH obtained by AH pretreatment of SB. Fig. 2 a–d shows the kinetic profiles for hydrogen production for all desirable conditions (DC1-DC4) as well as the kinetic parameters obtained by fitting the modified Gompertz model (Eq. (3)) to the experimental data. It is seen that the modified Gompertz model fitted well the experimental data with determination coefficients (R 2) higher than 0.96 for all experiments, suggesting that it can satisfactorily predict at least 96% of the experimental data for all conditions (DC1-DC4). The value of maximum hydrogen production rate (R) observed for HH from DC2 (1.417mmolH2·d−1) was at least 50% higher than those obtained at the other pretreatment conditions (DC1=0.774mmolH2·d−1, DC3=0.815mmolH2·d−1 and DC4=0.840mmolH2·d−1). A better performance in the acidogenic stage observed for the HH generated by DC2 condition may be related to the amount of total organic carbon converted into VFA, since the acidogenic conversion efficiency (AE) was 91.85% for this hydrolysate. This value is higher than those found for the HH from DC1 (AE =55.40%), DC3 (AD =88.69%) and DC4 (AE =82.98%), suggesting that the composition of the HH from DC2 was more appropriate for the acidification process. Additionally, a hypothesis that explains the worse performance of HH from DC1 is the lower conversion of organic compounds into acids, which many routes are related to the production of hydrogen. The acidogenic conversion indirectly affects the additional methane production, and during the methanogenic stage it was observed that the acidogenic effluent generated from DC2 also exhibited the higher methane production (see Table 1). During the acidogenic stage the VFAs normally accumulate as the main products. Fig. 3 shows the concentration of different VFAs such as formic acid (HF), acetic acid (HAc), propionic acid (HPro), lactic acid (HLac) butyric acid (HBut) and valeric acid (HVal). In addition, Fig. 3 shows the contents of some components of HH such as glucose (Glu), arabinose (Ara), xylose (Xyl), 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfuraldehyde (HMF) and 2-furfuraldehyde (FF) before and after the acidogenic stage. In the acidogenic stage it was observed that the easily degradable compounds such as C5-C6 sugars were largely used by the microorganisms and converted into VFA. In all desirable conditions studied (DC1-DC4), the main sugars (xylose, arabinose and glucose) present in the HH were not observed in the acidogenic effluent. Furthermore, in all desirable conditions it was noticed a reduction in the amount of compounds considered as toxic for methanogenic microorganisms such as HMF and FF. The removal efficiencies for furans (HMF plus FF) in all HH evaluated were greater than 80%. Kongjan et al. (2010) also reported the degradation of toxic compounds such as HMF and FF in the presence of microorganisms such as Thermodes ulfovibrio sp found in microbial consortium hydrogen producer. The results obtained in the present study demonstrate the capacity of hydrogen producing microorganisms for assimilating such compounds. The reduction in the concentration of toxic compounds during the hydrogen producing experiments enables the utilization of the acidogenic phase to detoxify the HH before its use for methane production as it is known that the methanogenic microorganisms have lower growth rates and are less tolerant to toxic compounds such as furans. The main soluble metabolites generated by acidogenic digestion of the HH were acetic and butyric acids. Fig. 3 shows that for HH obtained by severe pretreatment conditions higher amounts of SL and furans were produced (DC1, DC3 and DC4) and consequently there was a predominant formation of butyric acid in detriment to acetic acid. Some authors (Buitrón et al., 2014; Lazaro et al., 2014; Pattra et al., 2008) used the HAc/Total VFA and HBut/Total VFA ratios to estimate the predominant metabolic pathway of acidogenic microorganisms. In the present study, at the end of the acidogenic stage using the HH from DC2, the HAc/Total VFA ratio (0.47mgHAc·mgTotalVFA−1) was higher than the HBut/Total VFA ratio (0.23mgHBut·mgTotalVFA−1), thereby indicating that the acetic pathway predominated. The higher BHP value (0.293Nm3·kgTOC−1) observed for the HH from DC2 may be explained considering that 4mol of hydrogen can be produced from 1mol of glucose via the acetate (C2H4O2) fermentation pathway, whereas for the butyrate fermentation pathway only 2mol of hydrogen are expected (Fangkum and Reungsang, 2011). Therefore, the HH that favored the acetate pathway (DC2) seems to be more adequate for hydrogen production. Conversely, for those HH with higher amounts of toxic compounds (DC1, DC3 and DC4), the acid fermentation followed the butyric pathway as the HBut/Total VFA ratio was always greater than the HAc/Total VFA ratio (DC1 – 0.34mgHBut·mgTotalVFA−1 compared to 0.29mgHAc·mgTotalVFA−1; DC3 – 0.39mgHBut·mgTotalVFA−1 compared to 0.28mgHAc·mgTotalVFA−1 and DC4 – 0.36mgHBut·mgTotalVFA−1 compared to 0.20mgHAc·mgTotalVFA−1). These results are in good agreement with those reported by Fangkum and Reungsang (2011), who also noticed a butyrate fermentation pathway for HH produced by acid pretreatment (5% H2SO4 (v/v), 60min and 121°C) of sugarcane bagasse. Such pretreatment condition was also responsible for producing high amounts of furans, even higher than the severest AH conditions applied in the present study, due to the use of an inorganic and strong acid (H2SO4) as a catalyst. Other metabolite produced by acidogenic degradation of HH from DC1, DC3 and DC4 was the lactic acid. At the end of the acidogenic stage the concentration of lactic acid in the effluents was 732mg·L−1 (DC1), 65mg·L−1 (DC2), 815mg·L−1 (DC3) and 422mg·L−1 (DC4). The higher amounts of lactic acid resulting from the fermentation of the HH from DC1, DC3 and DC4 may explain the higher values of BHP observed during the fermentation of the HH from DC2. According to Nualsri et al. (2016), there is no consumption or generation of H2 associated to the formation of lactic acid from sugars (C5-C6) during acid fermentation. Thus, desirable conditions that led to greater amounts of lactic acid exhibit lesser hydrogen production and BHP values, respectively. The same findings were observed in the present study as previously discussed. The values of TOC removal efficiency during the acidogenic stage for all HH were lower than 40%, indicating that the acidogenic stage did not contribute for carbon removal from the liquid phase. Indeed, the data presented before suggest that the majority of the organic matter present in the HH was converted into VFAs. Due to the large amount of residual organic matter in the acidogenic effluent it is required an additional step to remove carbon from the liquid phase. This can be accomplished by methane production in a subsequent methanogenic stage, which can have the additional benefit of improving the energy recovery from HH."
13,Evaluation of the methanogenic biodegradability of the effluent from acidogenic stage,"3.3 Evaluation of the methanogenic biodegradability of the effluent from acidogenic stage The methanogenic stage in a two-stage anaerobic digestion system started at the end of the acidogenic stage. In order to simulate this at a batch laboratory scale, the acidogenic effluent was recovered and subjected to a methanogenic stage as described in Section 2.6. Results of fitting the first-order kinetic model to the experimental data of methane production for all desirable conditions studied are shown in Fig. 4 . The kinetic rate constants (k h) as well as the reaction extents (B 0) and the determination coefficients (R 2) are also shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 shows that methane production started from the beginning, implying the methanogenic microorganisms experienced little toxicity and needed no noticeable adaptation period or lag phase. These results differ from those reported by Baeta et al. (2016), who evaluated the methane production from HH obtained in the same SB autohydrolysis pretreatment conditions employed in the present study in a single-stage system. Baeta et al. (2016) reported lag phases from 7.53 to 11.37days for methane production from HH, indicating that a higher degree of toxicity was present at the beginning of the methanogenic tests. Supplementary Table 2 compares the BMP values as well as the kinetic parameters obtained for methane production in a single-stage reported by Baeta et al. (2016) with those values obtained in the present study when the methane production was performed in two-stage system (acidogenic-methanogenic). A possible explanation for the differences observed in the adaptation phase (lag time) seems to be related to the fact that acidogenic stage was used in the present study as a biodetoxification step of the HH. The hypothesis raised is that the acidogenic microorganisms were capable of hydrolyzing xylooligomers into xylose, thereby converting sugars into acids as well as decreasing the concentration of compounds considered as toxic (HMF and FF) for methanogenic microorganisms (see Fig. 3). The increase in the methane production in the two-stage system can be observed by comparing the BMP values. For all HH studied, the addition of an acidogenic stage enhanced the methanogenic activity and increased the BMP values by up to 4-fold (DC1=35.1%, DC2=16.0%, DC3=216.0% and DC4=334.3%). In addition to this, the specific maximum methane production rate (R SCH4) has also been improved for all HH incubated in a two-stage system when compared to the values obtained in a single-stage system, as reported by Baeta et al. (2016). For instance, the values of R SCH4 for the two-stage system for DC1 and DC2 were 2.7 and 1.53times higher than those observed for the single-stage system, respectively, whereas for DC3 and DC4 the R SCH4 values were 14 times higher than those observed for the single-stage system. An explanation for the greater change observed in the methane production rate for DC3 and DC4 may be related to the higher amounts of xylooligomers found in these HH at the beginning of the acidogenic stage (see Table 1). It is hypothesized that the acidogenic stage contributed to the hydrolysis of xylooligomers into xylose, which associated to the removal of toxic compounds (e.g. furans and SL), improved the HH biodegradability for methanogenic microorganisms. The results reported in the present study showed that regardless the characteristics of the HH, the addition of an acidogenic stage before the methanogenic stage contributed to enhance the methane production. The improvement in the kinetic parameters provided by the two-stage system allowed greater energy recovery from HH in the form of methane. When the BMP values for HH obtained by DC1 (1.0±0.02Nm3 CH4·kgTOC−1), DC2 (1.81±0.015CH4·kgTOC−1), DC3 (1.52±0.035Nm3 CH4·kgTOC−1) and DC4 (1.52±0.052Nm3 CH4·kgTOC−1) are compared to the results obtained by other authors, it is possible to notice that the two-stage anaerobic system is a promising configuration to improve methane production from HH when compared to single-stage systems. For instance, Kaparaju et al. (2009a) evaluated the anaerobic biodegradability of HH resulting from sequential autohydrolysis (180°C for 15min and 190°C for 3min) of wheat straw and found the highest methane production as ∼0.34Nm3 CH4·kgCOD−1. Costa et al. (2014) also reported BMP values of ∼0.20Nm3 CH4·kgCOD−1 for a HH generated from AH pretreatment (200°C for 10min) of sugarcane bagasse when using the conventional single-stage configuration. In addition, the anaerobic digestion in a two-stage system led to good TOC removal efficiencies for all HH studied (DC1=82.71%, DC2=86.98%, DC3=89.32% and DC4=89.42%), ensuring the generation of an effluent with lower amount of organic matter. The high TOC removal efficiencies observed also suggest that the microorganisms acting in the acidogenic and methanogenic stages could convert xylooligomers into monosaccharides, assuring a better use of the soluble organic matter contained in the HH."
14,Evaluation of the energy efficiency of a two-stage system,"3.4 Evaluation of the energy efficiency of a two-stage system Fig. 5 a and b shows the energy balance for the processes studied considering the four (DC1-DC4) conditions of SB pretreatment by AH as well as a flowchart of SB processing for energy recovery according to the biorefinery concept. It can be seen that anaerobic digestion of HH in a single-stage system had a positive energy balance only for the HH produced in DC2 (0.96MJ·kgSB−1 dry weight). This result shows that if only a single-stage is used during the anaerobic digestion of the HH, milder pretreatment conditions (178.6°C for 43.6min) should be used to yield a HH with lower amount of SL and furans, and thereby less toxic to methanogenic microorganisms. However, when a two-stage system was used, all HH exhibited a net positive energy balance with higher values of harvested energy being observed for AH pretreatment conditions of higher severity such as DC3 (178.6°C for 55min) and DC4 (182.9°C for 40.71min). Such results are of great interest as they make possible to employ higher temperatures and times (higher severity) during the AH pretreatment of SB, ensuring good energy recovery from HH when a two-stage anaerobic system is adopted. The HH that exhibited the best net energy balance for the two-stage system, 3.15MJ·kgSB−1 dry weight, was that produced by DC4. This value is lower than that obtained by Kumari and Das (2015) (7.98MJ·kgSB−1 dry weight), who evaluated the energy recovery from sugarcane bagasse pretreated by alkali followed by enzymatic hydrolysis. However, it is noteworthy that these authors did not consider the energy spent during the pretreatment step and that the proposed process consisted of two steps, i.e. a pretreatment for decreasing the sugarcane bagasse recalcitrance followed by enzymatic hydrolysis. In addition, the whole polysaccharide fraction (i.e. liquid plus solid) contained in sugarcane bagasse was used for biogas production, and this would obviously prevent the production of 2G bioethanol from surplus sugarcane bagasse generated in the 1G bioethanol production process. An explanation for the greater energy recovery observed for HH from DC4 in comparison with the other HH is the gain of energy from the methane combustion. For this HH, the inclusion of the acidogenic stage provided an increase in the methane production (1.17Nm3 CH4·kgTOC−1). Considering the ΔH combustion of methane and a combustion efficiency of 90% (see Section 2.8), the energy gain would be 36.3MJ·kgTOC−1, which is greater than the values calculated for the HH generated by DC1 (8.0MJ·kgTOC−1), DC2 (7.8MJ·kgTOC−1) and DC3 (32.3MJ·kgTOC−1). Moreover, it should be emphasized that the DC4 condition employed the lowest amount of water (3.95mL·gSB−1 dry weight) when compared to the other conditions (DC1=7.00mL·gSB−1 dry weight; DC2=4.20mL·gSB−1 dry weight and DC3=5.25mL·gSB−1 dry weight), which contributed to a lower energy expenditure during the AH pretreatment, as a great part of the energy is required for water heating. Fig. 5b shows a flowchart of the suggested process to maximize power generation considering the integration of 1G and 2G bioethanol production process, which uses the AH pretreatment to decrease the recalcitrance of surplus sugarcane bagasse from 1G bioethanol process. In addition, it considers as energy inputs the generation of 2G bioethanol from the cellulose enriched solid fraction (SF) (resulting from the AH pretreatment) along with the biogas generated from the anaerobic digestion of the HH in a two-stage anaerobic system. In order to estimate the amount of 2G bioethanol that could be produced from the solid fraction generated by DC4, it was considered a generation rate of 0.705kgSF·kgSB−1 dry weight (assuming a weight loss of 29.5% after AH pretreatment), an enzymatic hydrolysis (EH) efficiency of 62.18%, an yield of 0.42g bioethanol·gglucose−1 during the yeast fermentation (Rabelo et al., 2011) and an ethanol density of 789g·L−1. The EH efficiency was measured (data not shown) from the enzymatic hydrolysis of the solid fraction resulted from SB pretreatment by AH using DC4. The EH was performed using the same methodology and commercial enzymes cocktail described by Gurgel et al. (2014). Fig. 5b shows that the amount of energy recovery in the best scenario is enough to distil 0.53 L of anhydrous ethanol per kg of SBdry weight, considering that the energy expended in this operation is ∼5.9MJ·L−1 anhydrous ethanol (Pfeffer et al., 2007). In this scenario the estimated ethanol production by solid fraction rich in cellulose is to 0.152L. Thus, the net energy generated by two-stage system would be able to supply all energy expended in the production of 2G anhydrous bioethanol. Another alternative for the two-stage system is consider only the energy generated by the combustion of methane and evaluate the feasibility of selling the hydrogen produced in the acidogenic stage for chemical industries."
15,Conclusions,"This study demonstrates the production potential of hydrogen and methane using a two-stage anaerobic digestion (AD) of HH generated by autohydrolysis (AH) pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse (SB). The acidogenic stage worked to hydrolyze and biodetoxify the HH, improving the kinetic parameters and enhancing the methane production in the methanogenic stage. The adoption of the two-stage AD would allow the use of more severe AH pretreatment conditions (182.9°C, 40.7min and SLR =0.253gSBdry weight·mL−1), which in turn would lead to higher energy recovery (3.15MJ·kgSB−1 dry weight) and a net positive energy balance in an integrated 1G and 2G bioethanol plant."
