0,Introduction,"Lignin is a renewable aromatic polymer, accounting for 10–40 wt% of the plant cell wall, and constitutes a promising bioresource for the production of environmentally friendly polymer composites [1–3]. Industrial lignins are produced as by-products with large volume in pulping industry and cellulosic ethanol process [4–6]; however, most of them are being burned as an energy source to generate heat and electricity [7]. There have been a few studies on high-value applications of the usage of lignin, for instance, the production of bio-additives for multifunctional hydrogels [8,9] or nanostructured anode batteries for energy applications such as batteries, supercapacitors and thermoelectric devices [10–12]. The high-value utilization of industrial lignin is still challenging due to lignin's structural complexity and incompatibility with other polymers [13]. Furthermore, heterogeneous characteristics of industrial lignin, large particle size and poor water dispersibility limit its valorization and widespread utility [14,15]. In order to overcome these technical barriers and expand the high-value utilization of lignin, lignin nanoparticles (LNPs) stand tall among possible methods such as amination, sulfonation and depolymerization [16]. Similar to other natural nanoparticles, LNPs could be distributed evenly in the polymer matrix and interact synergistically with the polymer matrix. Consequently, they could be reinforced in a variety of polymers toward improving mechanical, thermal and UV-absorbing properties even with low filler loadings [17]. LNPs could be prepared through a variety of protocols such as mechanical methods, chemical modification and self-assembling [18–20]. Among them, self-assembling gained much attention due to its low energy consumption and simple operation, and more importantly, the versatility to yield particles of uniform size. It is a solution-based micellization process in which lignin will be dissolved in organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and dimethyl sulfoxide followed by an assembly in a controlled system through dropwise addition or dialysis. Easy volatilization and high toxicity of these organic solvents coupled with non-recyclable nature warrant alternative protocols [19]. Difficulty in controlling the particle size distribution and stable preservation further limit the mass production. In this regard, developing green and facile methods is critical. Such a quest led to deep eutectic solvents (DES), which indeed gained widespread attention due to their low cost, good stability, low toxicity and biodegradable properties [21]. Choline chloride based DES is one successful example [22]. Structural features of lignin recovered from DES pretreated biomass have also been reported [23,24]; however, the application of DES for the LNPs formation with industrial lignin has not yet been explored. In this regard, a comprehensive study on the activation modification and nanonization strategies of lignin in DES systems provides a novel platform for value-added applications of industrial lignin and forms the basis of the research reported in this submission. Herein, a facile and green LNPs production with industrial lignin using different DES systems, including acidic and alkaline systems, has been proposed to form size-controllable and stable LNPs. The particle size, morphology, stability, chemical structure and molecular weight of the LNPs were analyzed by dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). We also assessed the technical feasibility of the multifunctional nanocomposites through casting LNPs/PVA films. The overall performance of the obtained nanocomposites was investigated by UV–visible spectrophotometer, thermogravimetric analyzer, mechanical testing instrument and static contact angle tester. The interactions between LNPs and PVA matrix were observed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and SEM. The outcomes from the novel DES approach show the great potentials of the produced LNPs in its food and medical packaging applications."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The corncob alkali lignin was obtained from Longlive, Bio-Technology Co., Ltd. (Yucheng, China), which is composed of 6.3% acid soluble lignin, 91.7% acid insoluble lignin and 0.9% ash. The manufacturing and dried process of lignin used in this work was adapted from the previous study [25]. In brief, corncob firstly undergoes dilute acid hydrolysis to produce xylose and meanwhile obtain corncob hydrolysis residue. After further treatment of the residue with alkali, the effluent was separated and adjusted to acidic conditions to precipitate alkali lignin. The lignin was dried under vacuum at 50 °C for 24 h before use. Choline chloride (ChCl) was purchased from Yousuo Chemical Technology Co., Ltd. (Shandong, China). Ethanolamine (ETA), lactic acid (LA) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) (alcoholysis degree > 99%; Mw = 145 kDa) were purchased from Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All chemicals used in this study were analytical grade without further purification."
3,Synthesis of DES,"2.2 Synthesis of DES Deep eutectic solvents were synthesized by our previous work [26]. Briefly, choline chloride (ChCl) and ethanolamine (ETA) were used to synthesize alkaline DES at molar ratios of 1:6. Choline chloride (ChCl) and lactic acid (LA) were used to prepare acidic DES at molar ratios of 1:9."
4,Preparation of LNPs,"2.3 Preparation of LNPs The LNPs dispersion was prepared from corncob alkali lignin in DES by solvent shifting. In brief, a certain amount of lignin was added to DES and stirred for 1 h at ambient temperature (25 °C), then sonicate (240 W) for 20 min to prepare three concentrations of lignin-DES solution (i.e., 1, 3, and 5 wt% in ChCl/ETA or 3 wt% in ChCl/LA). Then, the lignin solution was dialyzed (Spectra/Por® 1 Standard RC Dry Dialysis Tubing, 2 kDa, Spectrum Labs, USA) in deionized water (periodically replaced) for 72 h. The obtained LNPs dispersion was formed and stored in the refrigerator (4 °C) for further characterization and application. Finally, the LNPs were freeze-dried at −50 °C and 0.12 mbar and coded as LNPs-x, where x refers to the initial concentration of lignin solution (1, 3, and 5 wt%)."
5,Structural characterization of lignin and LNPs,"2.4 Structural characterization of lignin and LNPs In order to keep the original states of LNPs, the sample was measured without further treatment. The size of LNPs in suspension was detected by DLS, using Zetasizer instrument (Malvern, Nano-ZS90, UK); the suspension was measured three times to obtain exact results. The micro-morphologies of the nanoparticles were observed by SEM (Hitachi Regulus 8220, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. Drops of the LNPs suspension on a silicon substrate, air-dried for 24 h and sputter-coated with gold to provide adequate conductivity. TEM images of the LNPs were obtained by a JEM-2100F TEM under zero-loss conditions at liquid nitrogen temperature. Infrared (IR) spectra of the powdered lignin and LNPs were measured by an FTIR spectrometer (Brooke, ALPHA, Germany). The molecular weight distributions of the samples were determined by GPC according to our previous work [26]. Two-dimensional (2D) heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) was recorded at room temperature using a Bruker Avance II HD 400 MHz instrument with a BBFO probe equipped with a Z-gradient coil, according to the literature [23,27]."
6,Preparation and characterization of LNPs/PVA nanocomposite films,"2.5 Preparation and characterization of LNPs/PVA nanocomposite films The LNPs/PVA nanocomposite films were prepared by a facile solution casting method. First, the PVA was dissolved in deionized water with vigorous stirring at 90 °C for 2 h to prepare a 3 wt% PVA solution. Then, the prepared LNPs-1 suspension and PVA solution were mixed with stirring at 500 rpm for 2 h. After that, the homogeneous mixture of LNPs and PVA was poured onto a plastic mold (90 mm by 90 mm) at once. The composite films with 70 (±10) μm thickness were obtained by evaporating the water and dried at 55 °C for 12 h in a convection oven, then equilibrated for 12 h at a glass desiccator. Four samples with different LNPs contents in the mixture were prepared and labeled as 1%LNPs/PVA, 3%LNPs/PVA, 5%LNPs/PVA and 10%LNPs/PVA, respectively. Parallelly, the control sample, 3%L/PVA, refers to the PVA composites incorporating 3 wt% of corncob alkali lignin, prepared by mixing the aqueous dispersion of the initial form of lignin with PVA solution as evenly as possible. The schematic diagram of the preparation procedure is outlined in Fig. 1 a. For measuring mechanical properties of the films, including tensile strength and elongation at break, dumbbell-shaped samples (75 mm × 4 mm) were tailored according to the standard GB/T1040-2006 at a loading speed of 30 mm min−1 at 25 °C under an RH of 50 ± 1% and tested by a texture analyzer (Stable Micro Systems, TA-XTplusC, Germany). Water contact angle (WCA) of the composite films was analyzed by a static contact angle measuring instrument (LAUDA Scientific, LSA100, Japan). The UV-shielding performance and optical transparency of the composite films were determined by a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV 2600, Japan). Thermal performance was performed by thermogravimeter (TA Instruments, Q50, USA), and the heating rate was 10 °C min−1 from 50 to 800 °C under N2 atmosphere according to the literature [28]. Infrared (IR) spectra of the films were measured by an FTIR spectrometer (Brooke, ALPHA, Germany). The morphologies of the obtained films were conducted by SEM (Hitachi Regulus 8220, Japan)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,"Particle size, morphology, and stability of the LNPs","3.1 Particle size, morphology, and stability of the LNPs The solubility of lignin plays an important role in its commercial applications. The complex structure of lignin could cause its poor solubility and dispersibility in many traditional organic solvents and water. Compared with the commonly used organic solvents like THF, DES showed higher solubility for industrial lignin [29–31]. It was reported that the characteristics of DES affect the applicability of LNPs fabrication methods [24]. In this regard, herein, two different DES were synthesized and tested for the formation mechanism of LNPs. Herein, the dialysis method was employed to produce LNPs, which exhibited the advantages of simple operation, high applicability, and good spherical productions. As shown in Fig. S1, after dialysis treatment, a better dispersity and stability of LNPs suspension was observed in the alkaline DES system (ChCl/ETA), while the bulk corncob alkali lignin precipitate was formed in the acidic DES system (ChCl/LA). This could be attributed to the polarity of DES. In the solvent exchange process, deionized water enters the acidic solution system and immediately results in lignin precipitation prior to LNPs formation. However, as the alkaline DES were dialyzed out, the solubility of lignin decreased, the hydrophilic units (e.g., hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups) of lignin extended outward [32]; therefore, the hydrophobic chain segments (phenylpropane structure, etc.) agglomerated inward forming LNPs dispersion [33]. This was similar to the formation of LNPs in the solvent shifting process. The forces for the aggregation of lignin molecules to form nanospheres include hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding, π-interaction, and van der Waals force [18]. Therefore, LNPs obtained in an alkaline system were selected for the further steps. The particle size, yield, morphology and stability of the LNPs varied depending on the initial concentration of lignin. The yields of LNPs with corncob alkali lignin were presented in Table 1 . The values of the yield for LNPs-1, LNPs-3 and LNPs-5 were 70.4, 64.3 and 62.7%, respectively. The particle size distributions and the average size of LNPs were presented in Fig. 1c and Table 1. It was found that the initial lignin concentrations had a significant effect on the final particle diameter. The increase of the initial lignin concentration from 1 to 5 wt% resulted in an increase of the average diameter from 8.9 ± 0.4 nm to 177.0 ± 3.5 nm. This could be attributed to a higher concentration of lignin in the DES system, meaning more lignin is available for the growth of nanoparticles. These variations were further confirmed by TEM (Fig. 1b) and SEM (Fig. 2 ), it is shown that portray self-assembling of lignin into nanospheres with various morphologies and sizes (Fig. 2b–d) while the initial corncob alkali lignin was irregular in shape with a broad distribution ranging from large micron-sized to nano-sized particles (Fig. 2a). A notable increase in LNPs size accompanied by the increment of inter-particle aggregation was also observed by increasing the lignin concentration. For better utilization of LNPs in various fields of advanced functional materials, the stability of LNPs dispersion over time is essential [34]. Due to the high content of phenolic hydroxyls and other acidic groups in lignin, the polar groups easily ionize in DES, making LNPs more hydrophilic and soluble. As shown in Table 1, the zeta-potentials of all the LNPs dispersion were higher than −30 mV, indicating relatively high stability of LNPs in anti-solvent (water). The stability of LNPs-3 was further confirmed (Figs. 3 and S2). The LNPs dispersion, quite apparent with light scattering even after 30 days, without significant change in diameter or zeta-potential. The average diameter of LNPs was still ranged from 64.9 to 97.4 nm after 30 days. The excellent stability of LNPs water-dispersion confirms their promising nature with other polymers for nanocomposite fabrication."
9,Physicochemical properties of lignin and the LNPs,"3.2 Physicochemical properties of lignin and the LNPs Further analyses were carried out to investigate the differences in the molecular weight, functional groups, and inter-unit linkages of each LNP. The molecular weights of the lignin and LNPs were listed in Table 2 . The weight-average molecular weight (M w ) of the lignin was 3889 Da with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.13. After dissolution and dialysis of DES under mild conditions, a subtle increase is noticed in M w of LNPs range from 4575 and 4657 Da. Thus, the molecular weights were quite stable and are not dependent on the initial lignin concentration. These results suggest the intact molecular weight and PDI of industrial lignin [35,36]. 2D-HSQC is an efficient method to further understand the compositional and structural changes of lignin during the LNPs formation. The aliphatic region (δC/δH 50.0–90.0/2.50–6.00), aromatic region (δC/δH 100.0–150.0/5.50–8.50) and the major substructures are depicted in Fig. 4 [37,38]. In the aliphatic region, the cross-peaks of the inter-unit linkages in lignin and LNPs, such as β-O-4 aryl ether linkages (A) and phenylcoumaran (β-5, C) were the most predominant in all lignin/LNPs fractions, while the resinol, and spirodienone substructures were not detected. The signals for methoxy groups (–OCH3, δC/δH 54.2/3.73) were also noticed. In the aromatic region, the signals of H, S and G units can be clearly seen. Lignin subunits S, G, and H are observed at δC/δH 104.8/6.73 (S2,6), 111.3/6.90 (G2), 114.9/6.81 (G5), 121.6/6.68 (G6), 129.4/7.01 (H2,6), respectively. Additionally, the strong and sharp cross signals at δC/δH 112.1/7.33 (FA2), 131.1/7.32 (pCA2,6), 143.5/7.47 (pCA7) from ferulate (FA) and p-coumarate (pCA) were detected. Compared with the initial lignin, the G-types in LNPs were decreased, especially the evanescent signal for G6. It was considered that a large amount of G-type units were connected by A linkage [39]; and the A linkage was relatively easy to be damaged to yield low-molecular weight lignin fractions, which were dialyzed out."
10,Performance of the LNPs/PVA nanocomposite films,"3.3 Performance of the LNPs/PVA nanocomposite films The LNPs-1 was selected for further research, which is expected to well-disperse with the smallest size and good stability for the matrix formation with the PVA. Transparent LNPs/PVA composite films were fabricated by facile solution blending and casting with uniform distribution of LNPs in the PVA matrix. Fig. 5 a and Table S1 highlight the stress-strain curves and characteristic mechanical parameters of LNPs/PVA nanocomposites films. Compared with the neat PVA films, the tensile strength of LNPs/PVA nanocomposite enhances significantly, indicating that LNPs addition has a synergistic effect. The hydrogen bonding interactions between PVA and LNPs appear to yield sturdy intermolecular complex and physical crosslinking (Fig. S3) [40]. The tensile strength increased to 63.7 MPa from 46.9 MPa of PVA with only 1 wt% LNPs loading. Furthermore, tensile strength increased with the LNPs amount. For example, when the amount of LNPs increased to 5 wt%, the tensile strength reached 81.0 MPa, which is almost twice that of the neat PVA films. However, further increase of the LNPs content to 10 wt% did not augment the value (82.5 MPa). This could be attributed to the accumulation of larger quantities of LNPs in the PVA matrix [41]. As for the flexibility, the elongation at break of the composite films increased to 110% in 1%LNPs/PVA. A maximum value of 117% in 5%LNPs/PVA was noticed, which is 31% increase compared to 89.0% of the neat PVA. Subsequent decline to 103% with the LNPs addition of 10 wt% was also observed. This may be due to the fact that adding excessive LNPs in the PVA matrix could lead to microphase separation in the films that in-turn trigger the elongation with break reduction [42]. The initial form of lignin-water dispersion was directly blended with PVA to produce the film as a control, but the poor interfacial binding between bulk lignin and the polymer matrix usually results in the deterioration of its mechanical performance. As shown by 3%L/PVA, although stress increases to 60.9 MPa, it is still lower than the composite films with the same content of LNPs, and the elongation at break is significantly reduced to 10.3%, which is only about one-ninth of the PVA films. This is could be due to the occurrence of macroscopic phase separation. The nano-effect of LNPs including increased surface area and good dispersion state potentially enhance their compatibility with the PVA matrix; thus, the resulting composite films could exhibit better mechanical performance. Water contact angle (WCA) measurements were carried out at room temperature, with water droplets 3 μL, under static conditions, and the values were recorded for 30 s. As shown in Fig. 6 a, PVA showed a rather high hydrophilicity surface due to the presence of abundant hydroxyl groups on the surface. Compared with the neat PVA films, the WCA of 1%LNPs/PVA films increased from 47.2° for PVA to 93.2° with only 1 wt% addition of LNPs, which is preserved up to 10% with a value of 117.0°. The hydrophobicity of LNPs/PVA films significantly improved because of the surface hydrophobicity of LNPs. The control sample (3%L/PVA) also showed good hydrophobic properties (101.9°), probably due to the intrinsic hydrophobicity of the lignin. The WCA values of LNPs/PVA composite films in this study were better than the biopolymer films with metal oxides and other lignin or LNPs [43,44]. This indicates that the PVA cross-linked with LNPs will reduce the water accessibility of PVA, which certainly expands PVA's application in water-based and alcoholic food contact packaging films. High transparency and strong UV absorption are significant for film application in food and medicine packaging. As shown in Fig. 6b, the PVA films display high transmittance toward UV. However, the LNPs/PVA nanocomposite films were efficient to block the UV light including both the UVA and UVB regions. The light transmittance declines with the LNPs content. This excellent UV blocking performance could be attributed to the aromatic structure and phenolic hydroxyls in LNPs, which showed strong UV absorption capacity [45,46]. Around 3 wt% of LNPs (3%LNPs/PVA) was sufficient to accomplish the 100% shielding of the UVB and UVC. Further LNPs content increase to 10 wt% resulted in the total blockage of the UV-light. The control sample (3%L/PVA) results showed that the blocking efficiency of the LNPs was much higher than that of pristine corncob alkali lignin in the PVA composite films with the same concentration. As shown in Fig. 1, the brown color introduced by LNPs influenced the transmittance of the PVA films in the visible-light region (400–800 nm). Despite this, the nanocomposite films maintained good transparency in the presence of 5 wt% LNPs, indicating that the addition of LNPs to the PVA films could provide an efficient UV block capacity without influencing its visible light transparency, which could be preferred in food and medicinal packaging [40]. The thermal properties of nanocomposite films are also significant indicators for their utilization as packing materials. Thermal properties of prepared PVA nanocomposite films in the presence of different contents of LNPs is presented in Fig. 6c–d, and Table S2. The melting temperature (Tm) of the PVA nanocomposite decreased with the LNPs content than that of the neat PVA films except for 10%LNPs/PVA, and the Tm of 5%LNPs/PVA reduces to 204.2 °C, which was 15.6 °C lower than that of the PVA (219.8 °C). It appears that LNPs thermal degradation starts at relatively low temperature (159.8 °C, Fig. S4). Fig. 6d highlights the DTG curves of the films. The maximum thermal decomposition rate temperature (Tmax) increased with the LNPs addition, for example, from 300.3 °C of PVA to 341.1 °C of 10%LNPs/PVA, which was 13.9% increase. The aromatic structural units of LNPs also play a significant role in the improvement of thermal stability; however, further research is needed to build on this concept. On the other hand, the Tmax of the control sample, 3%L/PVA, was 309.2 °C, which was lower than that of 3%LNPs/PVA, and the maximum thermal decomposition rate (0.18 wt%/°C) was also higher than that of the 3%LNPs/PVA. These results confirm that LNPs have good compatibility with PVA and are able to improve the thermal stability of the composite films. These LNPs/PVA nanocomposite films also outperform the lignin nanomicelle/PVA blend [41]."
11,Interactions between LNPs and PVA matrix,"3.4 Interactions between LNPs and PVA matrix The synergistic interactions between PVA and LNPs were confirmed by the ATR-FTIR (Fig. 7 ). The PVA exhibited a hydroxyl (OH) stretching vibration peak at 3270 cm−1. However, with the LNPs loading, a gradual shift to 3254 cm−1 was noticed, depending on the LNP concentration. In addition, a similar shift was also evident in C-OH groups vibration, which offset from 1085 to 1082 cm−1. These changes clearly highlight the strong hydrogen bonding interactions between hydroxyl groups in PVA and hydrophilic polar groups (hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups) in LNPs [17,41]. To reveal the enhanced mechanism of LNPs/PVA nanocomposite films, the dispersion of LNPs in the PVA matrix was studied by SEM. As shown in Fig. 8 , PVA exhibits a flat and uniform surface, and LNPs were dispersed without aggregation. The morphological structure of the LNPs was slightly changed after incorporation into the PVA matrix but still preserving their nanoscale structure. On the other hand, the surface of the control group 3%L/PVA showed agglomeration of micron-sized lignin particles. The presence of LNPs in the PVA matrix to form a microscopic phase separation structure greatly increases the hydrophobic group of the nanocomposite films and ultimately leads to an increase in the contact angle. These strong interactions may also be the driving forces to improve the mechanical properties of the nanocomposite films. In addition, the good dispersion state of LNPs was responsible for the excellent UV shielding and thermodynamics performance of the films [41]."
12,Conclusions,"The LNPs with the preservation of structural integrity of the original lignin were fabricated by an eco-friendly and economic process in the lignin-DES system without catalysts, toxic organic reagents and any other chemical modification steps. The alkaline DES system formed a smaller size (10–200 nm) and good dispersibility of the LNPs with stability over 30 days without significant changes in diameter and zeta-potential. Lignin nanoparticle was chosen as a good candidate for the next-generation functional nanocomposite films. Compared with the pure PVA films, the addition of LNPs improved the mechanical behavior of the LNPs/PVA nanocomposite films, and the tensile strength reached a maximum of 82.5 MPa at 10% LNPs addition which is nearly twice that of the PVA films. The incorporation of 3 wt% LNPs could achieve the full shielding of UVB and UVC and the majority of UVA shielding. The hydrophobicity and thermal stability of the nanocomposite films were also enhanced by introducing the LNPs. Overall, this study proposes a new solvent system to transform the industrial lignin into nanoparticles by an eco-friendly method. It further shows a significant means to prepare fully biodegradable and highly hydrophobicity PVA materials with excellent mechanical performance for a variety of applications such as food and medical packaging materials with UV-blocking behavior."
