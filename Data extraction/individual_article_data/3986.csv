0,Introduction,"Microbe-assisted conversion of lignocellulosic waste material to energy is considered as a promising alternative for renewable energy [1]. Lignocellulosic biomass comprises of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Cellulose is a macromolecule composed of glucose units, whereas hemicellulose contains xylose, glucose, arabinose, mannose, galactose and rhamnose [2]. Several strict and facultative anaerobic microbes are able to naturally produce energy molecules such as ethanol and H2 [3]. Lately, investigations on effective monomeric hemicellulosic sugar utilization and end product metabolite production have been reported for microbes such as Klebsiella pneumonia and Enterobacter sp [4,2,5]. Niu et al. (2010) investigated substrate utilization and H2 production by K. pneumonia ECU-15 strain in glucose and corn stalk hydrolysate [6]. Enterobacter aerogenes HGN-2 and HT 34 isolates have reported efficient fermentation when xylose was used as substrate yielding 1.98 mol-H2/mol-xylose [4]. Jayasinghearachchi et al. (2010) isolated Clostridium amygdalinum strain C9 and reported H2 production from xylose and arabinose at slightly alkaline pH and mesophilic conditions [7]. Over the years, several H2 producing Citrobacter strains have been isolated. Oh et al. (2003) isolated Citrobacter sp. Y19 from sludge digester and reported a H2 production efficiency of 2.49 mol-H2/mol-glucose [8]. Citrobacter intermedius isolated from sewage sludge was tested for H2 production under anaerobic batch conditions and observed a yield of 1.1 mol-H2/mol-glucose [9]. Biological H2 fermentation process efficiency is greatly affected by environmental factors such as medium pH, cultivation temperature, substrate, etc. In batch cultivations, initial medium pH is an important factor as medium pH affects cellular enzyme activities, lag phase and end-metabolite production. Cultivation temperature also greatly affects specific growth, microbial assisted hydrogen production, metabolite distribution. Studies on fermentative H2 production have been conducted at ambient [10], mesophilic [2,4,5,8] and thermophilic range [11,12]. Thus it is important to elucidate the initial pH and cultivation temperature for optimal H2 production. The aim of this study was to isolate cellobiose utilizing efficient H2 producer from activated sludge. Although several physio-chemical parameters influence H2 production, it has been reported that pH and temperature are the most important factors that affect H2 production efficiency [13]. In this study, optimal initial pH and temperature was investigated for maximal H2 and end-metabolite production. Further, cumulative H2 volume and H2 production rate at optimal culture conditions and glucose as the sole carbon source were studied. The bacterium was tested for substrate utilization and end-point H2, volatile fatty acids and alcohol production from galactose, mannose, xylose, arabinose and rhamnose. Finally, effect of increase in fermentation period on end-metabolite production was investigated for the above mentioned monomeric sugars."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Isolation of the strain CMC-1,"2.1 Isolation of the strain CMC-1 The enrichment system was designed as described by Ref. [14]. Eight 25 ml serum bottles were filled with 8 ml of M9 medium [15] containing 0.5 g/L cysteine-hydrochloride and a water-lock connected to each other with gas tight tubing. Cellobiose was used as the sole carbon source. Cellobiose concentrations were increased stepwise in seven bottles with an initial and final concentration of 1 and 60 g/L respectively. The bottles were purged with oxygen free nitrogen for 15 min, capped with septum rubber stoppers (20 mm), sealed with aluminum crimps and autoclaved at 121 °C for 15 min. After autoclaving, the serum bottles were placed in the flask clamps fixed on steel stage. The bottles were connected using tubing (13 cm, Masterflex® Norprene® tubing (A60 G)) with needles fixed at either ends. One end contained 1.2 mm × 50 mm needle and the other end 0.6 mm × 25 mm needle. A water lock was placed at the end of the system to allow the gas to get through and maintain anoxic environment in the system. Activated sludge collected from waste water treatment plant (Viinikanlahti, Finland) was used as inoculum. The sludge was cultivated in 120 ml serum bottles with working volume of 50 ml sterile anoxic glucose amended LB medium at 37 °C for 4 days. By the onset of H2 production, 5 ml of culture (10%) were inoculated to the first bottle of the enrichment system and incubated at 37 °C until the inoculum was transferred to the last bottle. After the run, culture samples from the last bottle were spread on M9 minimal agar plates containing 3 g/L carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). CMC was used as the sole substrate in order to ensure growth of microbes capable of utilizing complex substrates. The plates were then incubated in anaerobic jars at 37 °C."
3,Experimental procedure,"2.2 Experimental procedure Batch experiments were performed in 120 ml serum bottles with a working volume of 50 ml. The substrate concentration was kept at 5 mM and 500 μl of pre-culture was used as an inoculum. Glucose was used as the sole carbon source for all experiments unless otherwise stated. Batch experiments to investigate the effect of initial pH (4–7) on H2 production and cell growth were performed at 30 °C and 150 rpm. Growth and H2 production at different temperatures (25 °C–40 °C) were performed using a temperature gradient incubator (Test Tube Oscillator, Terra-tec, Australia) at optimal pH and 100 oscillation/min. Twenty-five milliliter tubes with 10 ml culture medium, supplemented with glucose (5 mM) was inoculated with 100 μl pre-culture and incubated in temperature gradient at the optimal initial pH (observed from pH experiment). The incubation time for optimal pH and temperature was 24 h. H2 production at optimal pH and temperature was conducted in duplicate cultivations. Carbon material balance was calculated by multiplying the yield obtained for each carbon containing metabolite by the respective number of carbons present in the molecular formula. The sum of total carbon mass obtained for individual metabolite was then divided by the number of carbon atoms in 1 mol of substrate used. The cellular composition of CMC-1 isolate was assumed to be CH1.67 O0.20 N0.27 [16]. The CO2 in the liquid phase was ignored during the carbon balance calculations. Cell growth and cumulative H2 production kinetic studies on glucose were performed at optimal pH and temperature. Specific growth rate (h−1) was calculated by substituting the data points at exponential curve in equation μ = ∆ln OD600/∆t. Cumulative H2 production was calculated as described by Lee and Rittmann (2009) [17]. The H2 yield values were calculated by converting the amount of end-point H2 gas produced (ml) to moles (mol) using the ideal gas equation for respective cultivation temperatures, dividing by the product of initial milli molar glucose concentration (mM) and the culture media volume (ml). The fermentation time for kinetic study was 24 h and was conducted in duplicate cultivations. The isolate was tested for substrate utilization efficiency and end product metabolite production when grown in galactose, mannose, xylose and arabinose for 24 and 48 h. Batch fermentations with monomeric hemicellulose sugars were performed in triplicate cultivations."
4,16S rRNA gene sequencing,"2.3 16S rRNA gene sequencing Genomic DNA was isolated using E.Z.N.A Bacterial DNA Kit (Omega bio-tek, USA). Amplification of 16S rRNA gene was done using 5′-CCT ACG GGA GGC AGC AG-3′ and 5′-CCG TCA ATT CMT TTG AGT TT-3′ primers. The amplified product was sequenced (Macrogen, Korea). The sequence was compared with existing related sequences available in GenBank using BLAST program."
5,Analytical techniques,"2.4 Analytical techniques Biomass for each batch fermentation experiments was determined by measuring the optical absorbance at 600 nm using a spectrophotometer. The value of the optical density was converted to dry cell weight (DCW) using a calibration equation (DCW = 0.294 × OD600 + 0.0717). Carbon substrates, organic acids and alcohols were analyzed using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) (LC-20AD, Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with Shodex SUGAR (SH1011) column (300 × 8 mm) and refractive index detector (RID, RID-10A). Prior to analyses, the culture samples were centrifuged at 7600g for 10 min and the supernatant was filtered through 0.45 μm disposable filters. A solution of 0.01N H2SO4 was used as the mobile phase at 0.9 ml/min and the column temperature was kept at room temperature. Sample injection volume was 100 μl. Gas chromatograph (GC-2014, Shimadzu GC), equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and PORAPAK column (2 m length and an inner diameter of 2 mm) were used to determine the gaseous content. N2 (Instrument N2 5.0) was used as carrier gas at the flow rate of 20 ml/min. The operating temperatures of the column, detector and oven were 80 °C, 110 °C and 80 °C respectively."
6,Results and discussions,
7,General characteristics and identification of isolated strain CMC-1,"3.1 General characteristics and identification of isolated strain CMC-1 Sample from activated sludge was enriched in cellobiose amended minimal medium and plated on agar plates containing CMC. Single colonies that appeared on CMC agar plates were eventually sub cultured for five rounds and grown in anaerobic jars at 37 °C. The isolate appeared to be yellow colored and round shaped colonies with irregular edges in M9 agar supplemented with CMC. From microscopic analysis and gram staining the isolated bacterial strain was found to be small rod shaped gram-negative bacteria. The strain is referred here as Citrobacter sp. CMC-1. Specific growth rates of CMC-1 isolate grown in M9 media supplemented with different carbon sources were: glucose 0.32 OD600 h−1, cellobiose 0.13 OD600 h−1 and CMC 0.08 OD600 h−1. Mean generation time of CMC-1 strain on glucose, cellobiose and CMC were calculated to be 2.1, 5.5 and 8.3 h respectively. Preliminary investigations on H2 production from cellobiose and CMC revealed that CMC-1 strain produced 1.4 ± 0.2 mol-H2/mol-cellobiose and 0.02 mmol-H2/g-CMC with mixed acid fermentation profile. Nucleotide BLAST searches against GeneBank database revealed that CMC-1 isolate belongs to the family Enterobacteriaceae. Within the Enterobacteriaceae family, the query sequence showed significant alignments with Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Klebsiella and Salmonella spp. The strain closely resembled to Citrobacter amalonaticus strain SA01 with 99% query coverage. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of CMC-1 isolate was deposited in GenBank with accession number GU324417."
8,Effect of initial pH on H2 production,"3.2 Effect of initial pH on H2 production The optimal initial pH of the culture medium that yielded the maximum H2 production on glucose fermentation by CMC-1 strain was investigated. CMC-1 isolate was observed to produce H2 at wide pH ranges as reported for several Citrobacter sp. [18,8]. Though H2 was produced, a drastic decrease in production yield was observed at pH values below 5.0. H2 production is favorable at slightly acidic pH but fermentation at pH values below 5.0, decreased H2 production efficiency also by others [19]. The optimal pH value of pH 6.0 identified from this study is in line with the work of Oh et al. (2003) for Citrobacter sp. Y19 and Hamilton et al. (2010) for Citrobacter freundii CWBI952 [8,20]. At optimal pH, a biomass amount of 0.16 ± 0.04 g/L was produced with H2 yield of 1.75 ± 0.08 mol-H2/mol-glucose. An increase in initial pH value (pH 7.0) resulted in 0.93 ± 0.03 mol-H2/mol-glucose (Fig. 1A). At optimal pH, the biogas H2 content reached a value of 15.84% ± 0.01 (Table 1 ). Seol et al. (2008) observed a similar decrease in H2 production efficiency at pH 7.0. At alkaline pH, the H2 production of Enterobacteriaceae is affected by the cellular formate regulation mechanism and subsequent breakdown of formate to H2 and CO2 [21]. Cell growth and glucose utilization were limited at pH 4.0. Glucose was completely utilized at pH 5.0. The cell density increased when raising the pH up to 6.0 and decreased at higher pH (Fig. 1A). Low biomass yields (0.09–0.16 g/L) at all pH values could be related to the absence of high substrate concentration, yeast extract and vitamins from the cultivation medium [16]. At optimal pH, acetate (10.92 ± 0.30 mM), ethanol (7.61 ± 0.10 mM), lactate (2.98 ± 0.35 mM) and formate (1.85 ± 0.07 mM) were the main metabolites produced (Fig. 1B). Lactate and ethanol were the sole metabolites produced at pH 4.0. An increase in pH from 4.0 resulted in a rise in acetate concentration (0–10.92 ± 0.30 mM). Formate accumulation was not observed at pH 4.0 and 5.0 but was evident in culture media from pH 6.0. This can be due to the formate transport mechanism extracellular to the cultivation medium at alkaline pH as explained by Seol et al. (2008) [21]."
9,Effect of temperature on H2 production,"3.3 Effect of temperature on H2 production The effect of temperature on H2 production was investigated within the range of 25–40 °C, with a stepwise increase of 0.5 °C between the cultivations. The initial pH was adjusted to be 6.0. The H2 yield increased from 1.42 ± 0.25 to 1.82 ± 0.02 mol-H2/mol-glucose as temperature increased from 25 °C to 34 °C. Further increase in temperature lowered the H2 yields (Fig. 2A). This implies that the optimal temperature for H2 production is 34 °C, in which H2 content of headspace was 16.83% ± 0.04. The lowest H2 yield of 0.61 ± 0.03 mol-H2/mol-glucose was observed at 40 °C. The decrease in H2 production can be explained by cell growth, because cell growth followed a similar trend as observed for H2 yield with the investigated temperature range (Fig. 2A). The H2 evolution was accompanied by the production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and ethanol as shown in Fig. 2B. Acetate, ethanol, lactate and formate were observed to be the major fermentation products. Ethanol concentrations remained unchanged at the tested temperature range and H2 production occurred along with acetate fermentation. Accumulated formate concentration was around 0.73–1.42 mM and increased formate level was observed at cultivation temperatures above 37 °C (3.0–4.24 mM). Fermentation at temperatures above 37 °C resulted in increased lactate production (4.93–6.09 mM), while acetate and ethanol levels decreased. The sharp reduction in H2 yield observed after 37 °C suggests that acetate production is accompanied with H2 production."
10,Carbon material balance in batch fermentation at optimal culture conditions,"3.4 Carbon material balance in batch fermentation at optimal culture conditions Table 2 summarizes the results of carbon mass balance calculations. Fermentation was performed in batch cultivations with a working volume of 50 ml corresponding to 49 ml M9 media, 500 μl (5 mM) glucose and 500 μl (1%) inoculum. As shown in Table 1, the carbon mass recovery was 99.7 ± 2.0%. The carbons from glucose were directed toward acetate, ethanol, formate, lactate, CO2 and biomass."
11,Growth and H2 production kinetics in glucose,"3.5 Growth and H2 production kinetics in glucose The kinetics of H2 production from glucose was studied for 24 h at 34 °C and pH 6.0. Cumulative H2 production initiated with a small lag phase. CMC-1 yielded the highest cumulative H2 volume by the 12th hour (20.1 ml), after which the H2 content was observed to decrease (Fig. 3A). The strain CMC-1 yielded the highest H2 production rate (mmol-H2/h) by the 4th hour (0.2 mmol-H2/h, Fig. 3B). Kim et al. (2008) have reported the presence of H2 evolving FHL complex at exponential growth phase and membrane bound uptake hydrogenase at stationary phase in C. amalonaticus Y19. The decrease in cumulative H2 production can be due to the activation of uptake hydrogenases in CMC-1 by the onset of the stationary phase [22]. The cell growth also followed the same progress of cumulative H2 production. The exponential growth phase for CMC-1 strain was from 2nd to 8th hour, producing maximal biomass of 0.16 g/L. The specific growth rate for CMC-1 strain on glucose was calculated to be 0.30 h−1 with a doubling time of 2.9 h. Acetate, lactate and ethanol were produced by the onset of biomass production. Formate accumulation was observed in the media at 6th hour but was absent in later time-point samples, indicating formate breakdown during subsequent fermentation. At the end of fermentation time, the concentration of lactate and ethanol was 1.68 ± 0.02 and 7.11 ± 0.02 mM respectively."
12,H2 production from xylose,"3.6 H2 production from xylose Xylose is the major pentose sugar residue of hemicelluloses. Bioenergy production from xylose fermentation by facultative anaerobic microbes has not been thoroughly studied [2]. Anand and Sripathi (2004) have isolated xylose utilizing microbes from the gut of Pteropus giganteus, comprising predominantly of C. freundii, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia liquefaciens and Klebsiella oxytoca. Their finding indicates the importance of facultative anaerobes in degrading complex substrates to produce valuable metabolites [23]. Batch experiment was conducted at 34 °C and pH 6.0 for 24 and 48 h. Xylose fermentation from 24 h cultivation yielded 1.22 ± 0.1 mol-H2/mol-xylose (Table 3 ). CMC-1 strain yielded 0.24 ± 0.01 mmol-biomass/mmol-xylose. When the fermentation time was increased to 48 h, the H2 and biomass yield increased to 1.63 ± 0.07 mol-H2/mol-xylose and 0.27 ± 0.02 mmol-biomass/mmol-xylose. H2 production through formate has been reported for C. amalonaticus Y19, mediated by FHL complex and hydrogenase. The increase in H2 yield within the longer fermentation time is due to the utilization of produced formate [22]. Analyzing the VFA’s and ethanol produced, xylose fermentation predominantly resulted in acetate, ethanol, formate and lactate (Table 4 ). Formate accumulation of 5.79 ± 0.28 mM was observed after 24 h cultivation. An increase in incubation time resulted in the decrease of formate concentration (5.79 ± 0.28–2.86 ± 0.13 mM) in the culture media. Increase in acetate and ethanol concentrations indicate more complete utilization of the sugar tested with prolonged fermentation time and mixed acid fermentation route of CMC-1 isolate. The decrease in formate concentration can be correlated with the increase in H2 production."
13,"H2 production by strain CMC-1 from galactose, mannose, arabinose and rhamnose","3.7 H2 production by strain CMC-1 from galactose, mannose, arabinose and rhamnose Galactose, mannose, arabinose and rhamnose fermentation studies were conducted to explore if CMC-1 isolate could produce H2 directly from monomeric hemicellulose sugars. Batch experiment was conducted at 34 °C and pH 6.0 for 24 and 48 h. CMC-1 strain produced H2 from all the above listed sugars and yielded 1.18 ± 0.04 mol-H2/mol-galactose, 1.23 ± 0.23 mol-H2/mol-mannose, 0.94 ± 0.07 mol-H2/mol-arabinose and 1.01 ± 0.08 mol-H2/mol-rhamnose (Table 3). Rhamnose fermentation was not investigated for 48 h. Prolonged cultivation time improved H2 yields from galactose (1.68 ± 0.24 mol) and mannose (1.93 ± 0.14 mol), when CMC-1 was able to completely utilize carbon sources. As explained above, this increase in H2 yield was due to residual formate breakdown. For arabinose fermentation, the H2 production trend was in the opposite fashion as that of other sugars. An increase in fermentation time decreased the H2 yield from 0.94 ± 0.07 to 0.79 ± 0.03 mol-H2/mol-arabinose. This can be due to the energy intensive arabinose utilization route, involving complex enzymatic reactions before entering the pentose phosphate pathway [24,25]. At the end of the 24 h mannose fermentation, formate (8.09 ± 0.22 mM), ethanol (3.9 ± 0.11 mM), acetate (3.89 ± 0.12 mM) and lactate (0.35 ± 0.06 mM) were the main metabolites produced with a biomass yield of 0.24 ± 0.03 mmol-biomass/mmol-mannose. Approximately 103 ± 0.42% of carbon was recovered from measured metabolites together with the biomass. After 48 h of fermentation, a rise in acetate concentration (4.30 ± 0.13 mM) was followed by a decrease in ethanol (4.4 ± 0.0 mM) and formate (5.45 ± 0.15 mM) accumulation compared to the values obtained after 24 h cultivation. Lactate concentration remained low even after prolonged fermentation (0.63 ± 0.45 mM). Low lactate production was due to low carbon source and thereby low intracellular pyruvate concentrations [12]. After 48 h cultivation, CMC-1 strain yielded 0.36 ± 0.02 mmol-biomass/mmol-mannose with a carbon recovery of 97 ± 0.39%. Galactose fermentation accumulated formate (7.36 ± 0.18 mM), ethanol (4.07 ± 0.09 mM), acetate (3.72 ± 0.05 mM) and lactate (0.69 ± 0.12 mM) as the main metabolites and yielded 0.25 ± 0.01 mmol-biomass/mmol-galactose. As in the case with mannose fermentation, prolonged incubation time with galactose resulted in improved acetate production (3.87 ± 0.24 mM) and biomass yield (0.32 ± 0.02 mmol-biomass/mmol-galactose), with a decrease in formate (4.56 ± 0.02 mM) concentration. Galactose was completely utilized at the end of fermentation and carbon mass recovery was calculated to be 101 ± 0.67%. The major VFAs produced from arabinose breakdown were acetate, ethanol, lactate and formate. An approximate amount of 99 ± 0.26% carbon was recovered from the 24 h arabinose fermentation. Acetate was the main metabolite and the concentration increased from 2.98 ± 0.01 to 3.28 ± 0.13 mM when the incubation time was increased (Table 4). Formate accumulation was observed to increase in the culture medium (from 6.78 ± 0.16 to 7.91 ± 0.28) and H2 production from extracellular formate was not observed. H2 and metabolite production from arabinose followed an opposite trend when compared with the other hexose and/or pentose sugars tested. Though ethanol was the only alcohol produced during the xylose, arabinose, galactose and mannose fermentation, a slightly different VFA profile was detected for rhamnose fermentation (Table 4). From rhamnose fermentation, CMC-1 strain produced small amounts of lactate (0.2 ± 0.03 mM). However, acetate and formate concentrations were 3.58 ± 0.08 and 5.09 ± 0.90 mM respectively. In addition to ethanol (0.29 ± 0.12 mM), propionate (2.26 ± 0.03 mM) and 1-propanol (2.95 ± 0.15) were observed in the culture media (Table 4). At the end of fermentation, CMC-1 yielded 0.51 ± 0.02 mol-1-propanol/mol-rhamnose and 0.22 ± 0.02 mmol-biomass/mmol-rhamnose."
14,Conclusions,"In this study, the isolation of a mesophilic H2 producing strain from activated sludge by using minimal media supplemented with cellobiose is described. The strain was identified as Citrobacter sp. based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The doubling time of CMC-1 strain on cellobiose and CMC were calculated to be 5.5 and 8.3 h respectively, registering a H2 production with yield of 1.4 ± 0.2 mol-H2/mol-cellobiose. The bacterium produced H2 at wide pH and temperature ranges. The maximal H2 yield from glucose at pH 6.0 and 34 °C was 1.82 ± 0.02 mol-H2/mol-glucose, with a specific growth rate of 0.30 h−1 and the highest H2 production rate of 0.2 mmol-H2/h. The strain can utilize monomeric hemicellulose sugars efficiently to produce H2 and value-added alcohols."
