0,Introduction,"In the context of the energy transition challenge, power-to-X (PtX) technologies coupled to renewable energy sources (RES) and captured CO2, might play a crucial role reducing CO2 emissions and substituting the products derived from fossil fuels with low-carbon counterparts [1,2]. Indeed, the “X” represents a wide variety of products, such as liquid and gaseous fuels (gasoline, kerosene, ethanol, methanol, methane, hydrogen, syngas, etc.), chemicals, and others, that could be employed in many different sectors, with net CO2 emissions near to zero [3,4]. In addition, PtX systems can provide a variety of chemicals, services and commodities in several sectors [5–9]: production of hydrogen and hydrogen carriers [10]; fuels for power generation and combined heat and power [11]; heat production [12,13]; transportation [14–17]; energy storage and grid ancillary services as well as grid balancing [11,18,19]; production of chemical compounds and fuels (i.e. methanol, dimethyl ether DME, formaldehyde, gasoline, diesel fuel, methane, syngas etc.) [20–22]. PtX technologies can boost RES penetration and reliability, allowing the storage of excess renewable energy in long-term and high-energy density storage systems, while creating a closed carbon cycle with near zero net CO2 emissions where CO2 is captured from concentrated sources or directly from the air [23–25]. Typically, hydrogen production is the first step in PtX processes. Hydrogen produced through this kind of processes can be deployed in a portfolio of several applications, all revolving around the first step of conversion of renewable electricity into hydrogen [26]. Chehade et al. [26] carried out an extensive review on 192 demonstration projects on power-to-X spread around the world in 32 different countries. The analysed power-to-X pathways falls within several categories: power-to-hydrogen (low-carbon electricity storage), hydrogen-to-power (using fuel cells or gas turbines), hydrogen-to-gas (pumping hydrogen into the natural gas grid), hydrogen-to-fuel, hydrogen-to-industry (refinery processes), hydrogen-to-heat (boilers and combined heat and power), and hydrogen-to-chemicals (methanol or syngas to C2, C3, olefins, or longer chain hydrocarbons). The study showed that Europe has the leading role in such projects, with a total of 154 projects (concluded or still ongoing), mostly based in Germany. Buffo et al. [27] summarised and compared the possible power-to-X routes taking into account different processes involving the conversion of power into useful products: power-to-power (within microgrids or off-grids areas), power-to-hydrogen, power-to-chemicals, power-to-gas, and power-to-liquids. The authors provided an overview on the adopted technologies, the benefits and services provided to the energy systems, the criticalities and strengths of each process, the potential applications, and the lessons learnt from the projects carried out worldwide. The main findings regard the potential use of CO2- and H2-derived products as substitutes of fossil fuels, thanks to their carbon–neutral characteristics when renewable electricity is employed. In addition, when CO2 is captured from air (direct air capture), these processes might even create a net-negative emission cycle. Bargiacchi et al. [28] carried out a comparative assessment of power-to-fuel production pathways of methane via a Sabatier process, methanol through carbon dioxide hydrogenation, ammonia production through the Haber-Bosch process, and the synthesis of urea via the Stamicarbon CO2 stripping process. The systems were analysed from the energy and exergy point of view showing a significant variability, depending on the process. For methane, ammonia, and urea production energy and exergy efficiency correspond, being equal to 72.1%, 51.9%, and 2.3%, respectively, while methanol production achieved an energy efficiency of 39.5% and an exergy one of 42.1%. De Vasconcelos et al. [20] performed a literature review on the recent advances in the production of fuels and chemicals through power-to-X processes. Authors focused on different technologies to produce hydrogen in a sustainable way, analysing the challenges to scale up the processes and integrate them with other technologies. The three main electrolysis technologies (i.e. alkaline, polymeric membrane, solid oxide cells) were analysed, as well as two laboratory-level technologies such as microbial electrolysis and biomass electro-reforming. Also, they compared different PtX processes, and the products obtained following CO2 hydrogenation and CO2 electrochemical reduction. The compounds taken into account were methanol, methane, and alkanes (i.e. gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel). Numerous other studies regarding power-to-X and power-to-liquids (PtL) systems based on different technologies and approaches can be found in literature, as for example, H2 production and compression [29], production of mixed alcohols [29] and other liquids through Fischer-Tropsch (FT) [30–32], hydrogen to liquids [33], power and biomass to liquids [34], methanol production [35], etc. Efficiency-wise, depending on the considered technology and pathway, conversion values of PtX spanning from 37 to 70% were found. Such values represent the conversion efficiency of energy and raw feedstocks into useful products (gaseous and liquid fuels) through different pathways and solutions, depending on the PtX technology. In particular, Mignard and Pritchard [29] analysed different processes to synthesise liquid fuels exploiting renewable marine energy and CO2 for the production of hydrogen at high pressure. Hydrogen is further converted into methanol, mixed alcohols through FT and gasoline using the Mobil process, obtaining efficiencies ranging from a minimum of 42% (gasoline via Mobil) to a maximum of 61% (compressed hydrogen at 40 MPa). O’Brien et al. [30] simulated a process with a UniSim model to evaluate the performance of a large-scale (300 MWe) high temperature co-electrolysis plant producing syngas and liquid fuels by FT, exploiting steam and CO2. The overall process efficiency was assessed between 43 and 44%. Graves et al. [31] carried out a critical review of different pathways for recycling CO2 into useful fuels exploiting renewable or nuclear energy (both characterised by zero CO2 emissions), based on CO2 capture, H2O and CO2 dissociation, and fuel synthesis. The authors [31] analysed technologies such as thermolysis, thermo-chemical cycles, electrolysis and photo-electrolysis, as well as high temperature co-electrolysis of water and CO2, CO2 direct air capture using solid sorbents and conversion of syngas into fuels by FT processes. They found that an energy system based on direct air CO2 capture, co-electrolysis of water and CO2 in a solid oxide cell, and FT conversion to liquid fuels achieves an electricity-to-liquid fuel efficiency of approximately 70%. Albrecht et al. [32] analysed the opportunity of using PtL plants in energy storage applications, finding that a system composed of solid oxide cells and FT synthesis produces a mixture of gasoline, kerosene and diesel fuel with an efficiency of 37% and 44%, considering a single-way or a reversible systems, respectively. Furthermore, Albrecth et al. [34,36] carried out a comprehensive and detailed techno-economic evaluation of alternative and cleaner approaches to produce jet fuel and other liquid fuels. In particular, a biomass-to-liquids, a power- and biomass-to-liquids, and a PtL process were analysed, showing an X-to-liquids efficiency of 36.3%, 51.4% and 50.6%, respectively. The corresponding overall plant efficiency achieved considering the by-products (i.e. electricity and the useful recoverable heat) were 82.6%, 65.0%, and 66.8%. Fasihi et al. [33] carried out a techno-economic assessment of a PtL process based on hybrid photovoltaic-wind power plants integrated with a FT process, finding an overall energy efficiency of 65% for a liquid fuel mixture composed of 15% naphtha, 25% jet fuel, and 60% diesel. Also, the authors [33] demonstrated the competitiveness of such systems compared to conventional fossil fuel diesel production. Crivellari et al. [35] analysed two innovative schemes to produce methanol from combined wind and solar power within an offshore oil & gas platform. One of the solutions is based on methanol production through CO2 hydrogenation from renewables, water and external CO2, while the other also exploits useful by-products of the oil & gas process. The authors [35] found that the synergy between the renewable methanol production and the oil & gas activities can counterbalance the footprint of such processes, also providing multiple valuable fuels. Schmidt et al. [14,37] proposed the PtL technology as a solution to produce green and sustainable methanol and aviation fuel. Different approaches such as low and high temperature electrolysis, CO2 capture from the atmosphere or from concentrated sources, methanol production or liquids fuel by FT, were considered. An efficiency of the methanol synthesis equal to 39% was obtained when coupled to direct CO2 capture, improving to 48% in case of concentrated CO2 capture [37]. For the aviation liquid fuels (LHV of 42 MJ/kg), the efficiency increases from 39% to 47%, switching from direct to concentrated CO2 capture [14]. Michailos et al. [38] carried out in Aspen Plus a techno-economic assessment on a system to synthesise DME following a power-to-liquids concept. The authors [38] found an overall efficiency of 44.4% with a CO2 conversion to DME of 82.3%. From the economic point of view, the production of renewable fuels from RES and captured CO2 will be more expensive than fossil fuel, but cheaper than biofuels [39]. Nevertheless, nowadays RES shows a levelised cost of energy of RES in the range of that of fossil fuels (0.050 to 0.170 USD/kWh), even without considering the RES incentives and the drawbacks caused by fossil fuels emissions, defining a promising future for these applications [40,41]. For example, in Europe, RES costs have dropped between 0.08 (onshore wind power) and 0.15 (offshore wind power) USD/kWh [40]. Indeed, the highest cost in PtX processes based on renewable hydrogen production and use is related to the electrolysis process (covering roughly 80% of the total energy costs of PtX systems). Nevertheless, in future perspective, these costs are expected to drop sensibly, allowing the PtX technologies to become advantageous compared to conventional fuel production, also considering future restrictions and taxation on CO2 emissions [42–45]. Among the PtX technologies, power-to-methanol is of particular importance thanks to the potential use of this chemical compound. Indeed, methanol is widely recognised as a fuel with many different uses as an energy feedstock, a hydrogen carrier and as a chemical compound [46–48]. At ambient conditions, methanol is a liquid characterised by a high energy density by volume compared to hydrogen, so resulting a good energy storage medium, not being affected by long-term decomposition or energy losses. A variety of chemical compounds, typically derived from fossil fuels, can be produced using methanol as a chemical feedstock: formaldehyde, DME, acetic acid, gasoline, diesel and many others [2], leading to the prospect of a future methanol economy [4,48,49]. Worldwide, the only existing power-to-methanol commercial-scale plant is located in Iceland (George Olah Plant [50]). The plant produces approximately 4000 t/year of methanol with an electrical power requirement of 6 MW, assuring a consumption of 5500 t/year of captured CO2 [51,52]. In the plant the production of a 1 t of methanol requires 0.19 t of hydrogen obtained through an alkaline water electrolysis process fed by RES and 1.38 t of CO2 recovered from the geothermal plant located nearby. Since the hydrogen is produced from RES and the CO2 is of anthropogenic origins, the methanol production reduces the life-cycle carbon footprint by about 90–99% compared to gasoline or diesel fuel. Even compared to the methanol production from natural gas, renewable methanol allows a reduction of the overall CO2 emissions by 1.53 t per t of produced methanol [52]. Even though precise data are not available about the Olah plant overall efficiency, Bergins et al. [53] estimated an efficiency of approximately 61% for a power-to-methanol plant with a capacity production of about 400 t/day based on RES (50–150 MWe electrolysers) and post combustion CO2 capture from a conventional coal power plant. To the best of authors’ knowledge, papers in literature do not show an overall perspective of the global process of production and use of renewable methanol, being focused on a few processes of the power-to-power chain based on methanol. In this framework, this paper is within the context of a research project on power to-methanol systems carried out by the same authors. In a previous paper [54] a power-to-methanol system based on a reversible solid oxide cell (RSOC) [55,56], integrated with a thermal energy storage (TES) system was studied. The overall system was characterised by a global efficiency of about 0.33. Since the technology readiness (TRL [57]) level of SOEC and RSOC is still quite low, in this paper the less conventional integrated system based on RSOC was compared with a more commercially ready system based on an alkaline electrolyser (AEL) coupled to a SOFC, that is a more mature technology. In fact, SOEC and RSOC are typically derived from SOFC with slight modifications to operate in electrolysis or reversible mode. The performance of RSOC in SOFC-mode were assumed equal to these of a conventional SOFC fuel cell. The configuration based on AEL and SOFC allows the evaluation of the capabilities of this kind of systems in a near term perspective compared to SOEC and RSOC technologies, that are foreseen to reach commercial maturity by 2030. Moreover, in this paper, an ORC for exploiting power generation from the waste heat was also introduced and the thermal integration in each section was optimised with respect to reference [54]. In addition, a smaller plant was considered to align the power produced in SOFC operation to the state of the art of commercial modules, characterised by a maximum power output of 1 MW. As previously specified, this work is mainly focused on the analysis and comparison of two power-to-methanol integrated systems based on different electrolysis technology, i.e. alkaline electrolysers (AEL) and high temperature solid oxide cells (SOEC) [58,59], to perform renewable energy storage. Renewable hydrogen produced exploiting excess RES reacts with captured CO2 producing methanol in a synthesis reactor. Methanol is purified and then stored (charge phase of the energy storage system). Then, methanol feed the SOFC producing electricity when necessary. In case of SOEC configuration, the system was supposed to be based on a RSOC, capable of operating alternatively as an SOEC to produce hydrogen and as an SOFC to produce electricity, reducing the plant components. RSOCs are developed from the affirmed SOFC technology and operate typically in a temperature range between 700 and 1000 °C in both fuel cell and electrolyser mode [60,61]. The high temperature operation guarantees high efficiencies in both modes thanks to better reaction kinetics and lower electrochemical losses. Depending on the chosen electrolysis technology, waste heat contained in the exhaust gases of the SOFC is either stored in a TES system to reduce the thermal requirements in electrolysis operation or used in an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) to boost the electricity production of the plant during the discharge phase. Several performance indices were specifically defined to evaluate the efficiencies of each section and of the overall system through energy and mass balances. The simulations of the considered energy systems were carried out in Aspen Plus environment, where special models were developed to simulate the electrolysis and fuel cell processes, the methanol synthesis and purification processes, as well as the ORC engine. The two integrated systems and their subsystems were compared through the analysis of appropriate performance indices."
1,Overall system configuration,"The general configuration of the overall system includes a water electrolysis section, a methanol synthesis section (MSS), a SOFC, an ORC engine system, a thermal energy storage (TES) system and a heat integration section comprising heaters to boot the system. As previously specified, the water electrolysis is performed considering the commercially mature technology of alkaline electrolysers (case A) or the innovative technology of solid oxide electrolysers (case B). The ORC and the TES sections are optional, depending on the case. The system operates in charge phase when electricity in excess is stored as chemical power into methanol, and in discharge phase when the stored methanol is used to produce electricity. Fig. 1 shows a simplified functional scheme of the general configuration of the overall system. Water and renewable electricity feed the electrolyser to produce hydrogen. Hydrogen and CO2 are compressed at the operating pressure of the methanol synthesis reactor in two intercooled compressor trains. In the MSS, CO2 hydrogenation to methanol is carried out over a commercial catalyst (Cu/ZnO/Al2O3) and methanol is separated and purified in a distillation column. During the discharge phase, methanol is reformed and oxidised in a solid oxide fuel cell to produce electricity, while exhaust gases, rich in H2 and CO, are burnt in a post-combustor. The heat released during SOFC operation is either supplied to an ORC engine (case A) or stored in a TES system (case B) to provide thermal energy to the SOEC process. The “Users” block represents another opportunity for this kind of systems, where the produced methanol can be used in different applications than energy storage for electricity production, as for example as a feedstock in chemical industry or as a fuel in other applications. The only commercial RSOC systems, derived from SOFC, are characterised by a maximum power of 30–50 kW when operated as SOFC and a power requirement of about 150 kW when operated as SOEC [62]. Nevertheless, nowadays SOFCs are available with a maximum power of 1 MW [63]. The SOFC was assumed to play the decisive role for sizing all other components. Consequently, the overall systems were both (case A and case B) sized to produce 1 MW of electric power with the SOFC, assuming that RSOCs will be scaled up to SOFC typical power. The flow rates of the streams of all the sections were calculated with reference to such a SOFC power. In particular, a methanol flow rate of 371.6 kg/h is necessary for feeding the SOFC. The required methanol is produced by reacting 75.6 kg/h of hydrogen with 550.5 kg/h of CO2."
2,System based on alkaline water electrolysis,"Firstly, the configuration based on more commercial mature technologies was studied (case A). In particular, the overall system is composed of: • An alkaline water electrolyser, • A methanol synthesis and purification section, • A solid oxide fuel cell, • An organic Rankine cycle device. Since the AEL operates at low temperature, the heat released during SOFC operation might be used or stored for different applications, such as the introduction of an ORC or to produce hot district water. The ORC is in series with the SOFC, it is fed with the hot exhaust gases of the latter and it allows an enhanced production of electricity, increasing the overall system efficiency. As previously specified, the size and characteristics of the AEL-based system were all defined with reference to the SOFC nominal power of 1 MWe."
3,Modelling of the alkaline water electrolyser,"3.1 Modelling of the alkaline water electrolyser Alkaline electrolysis of water is a low temperature process to produce hydrogen in a commercially mature technology, namely the alkaline electrolyser. Water electrolysis is carried out in a liquid alkaline electrolyte solution of a base ( K O H or N a O H ), where hydroxide ions O H - cross a diaphragm separating the electrodes. Typically, AELs operate between 60 and 90 °C, while the operating pressure spans from ambient pressure up to 3.5 MPa [64]. In this work the alkaline water electrolysis is performed at 2.5 MPa and 65 °C with a power consumption of approximately 3450 kW and a hydrogen flow rate of 76 kg/h, leading to a specific energy consumption of approximately 45.5 k W h / k g H 2 (4.05 k W h / N m H 2 3 ), consistent with values reported in the literature [65,66]. An existing electrochemical model for the simulation of a commercial AEL, originally developed by Ursua and Sanchis [65], was implemented in the Fortran routines of Aspen Plus. To make the system scalable, depending on the desired hydrogen production and on the voltage and current values, different arrangement in series and parallel can be chosen. Since the electrolyser is characterised by parasitic current loss, a Faraday efficiency η F , defined as the ratio between the actual hydrogen production rate and the theoretical production, was considered. This efficiency is bound to the characteristic of the electrolyser and depends on the operating temperature. In this study the Faraday efficiency empirical relation developed by Ulleberg [67] and reported by Eq. (1), was applied: (1) η F = a 1 exp a 2 + a 3 T c + a 4 T c 2 I / A + a 5 + a 6 T c + a 7 T c 2 ( I / A ) 2 where T c is the cell operating temperature and A is the active area of the cell. Table 1 reports the value of the other parameters used to calculate the Faraday efficiency as Eq. (1). A simplified functional scheme of the model of the AEL as it was implemented in Aspen Plus is reported in Fig. 2 . In Fig. 2, water (1EA) is pumped (PEA) and heated up (H1EA) to the cell operating temperature before feeding the reactor (R1EA). Since the operating voltage of one cell (1.70 V at 65 °C and 2.5 MPa) is above the thermoneutral voltage at the same conditions (1.47 V), due to the low temperature operation, the heat produced by the Joule effect can be used to preheat the inlet water. Inside R1EA the water splitting reactions are carried out producing hydrogen (3EA) and oxygen (4EA). The reactor was modelled as a stoichiometric reactor (RStoic block in the Aspen Plus environmental). Since the utilisation factor is set to 1 a water flow rate of approximately 675 kg/h is necessary to produce the 76 kg/h hydrogen stream required by the MSS to obtain the desired methanol production. The electrochemical behaviour and the characteristic curves of the electrolyser are defined by the comprehensive model implemented in a Fortran routine. The equilibrium voltage of the stack is expressed as a function of temperature and pressure according to Eq. (2): (2) E eq = N S E 0 + R T c 2 F ln p - p v , K O H p - p v , K O H 1 2 a H 2 O , K O H where the term N S indicates the number of cells of a stack, E 0 is the reversible potential of one cell; p and p v , K O H are the stack operating pressure and the vapour pressure of the K O H solution, while a H 2 O , K O H represents the water activity in the K O H solution. The reversible potential E 0 is calculated by means of Eq. (3): (3) E 0 = 1.5184 - 1.5421 × 10 - 3 T c + 9.526 × 10 - 5 T c ln T c + 9.84 × 10 - 8 T c 2 Finally, the AEL net voltage E AEL is evaluated adding to the equilibrium potential E eq the overvoltages caused by the ohmic and activation resistances as shown in Eq. (4): (4) E AEL = E eq + V ohm + V act , a n + V act , c a t 3.1.1 Validation and results of the alkaline water electrolyser The electrochemical model developed in Aspen Plus was validated through a comparison with the experimental results reported by Ursúa and Sanchis [65] for a stack composed of 22 cells, with a cell area of 300 cm2. The validation was carried out at 2.5 MPa for temperature values of 15, 35 and 65 °C (as the experimental tests in [65]). Table 2 reports the values of the main parameters considered for the validation. Fig. 3 shows the comparison between the results of the model developed in Aspen Plus and the experimental ones reported by Ursúa and Sanchis. As can be seen from Fig. 3, the Aspen Plus model follows the reference experimental curves closely, leading to an accurate evaluation of the system voltage and, consequently, of its power consumption and efficiency. Fig. 4 represents the power consumption (left) and efficiency (right) of the AEL as a function of the pressure, for different temperatures of the electrolyser, whereas Fig. 5 represents the same performance characteristics as a function of temperature, for different pressures of the electrolyser. For a given cell temperature, an increase of the cell pressure leads to a greater power consumption and to an efficiency reduction. On the contrary, for a given cell pressure, an increase of the temperature reduces the power consumption and boosts the efficiency. Even though a higher electrolysis pressure causes an increase in the consumed power in the AEL, a higher pressure reduces the power required by the hydrogen compressors in the methanol synthesis section. Assuming AEL operating pressures of 0.5 and 2.5 MPa, the power absorbed by the AEL is equal to 3381 kW and 3453 kW, respectively, at an operating temperature of 65 °C. To produce the required 76 kg/h of hydrogen, given the cell area of 300 cm2, using the polarisation curves, and to avoid exceeding the nominal current and current density reported in [65] (120 A and 4000 A/m2, respectively), a total of 16,764 cells, corresponding to 762 modules of 22 cells each, was calculated. The modules were arranged in 6 parallels."
4,Modelling of the methanol synthesis section,"3.2 Modelling of the methanol synthesis section Downstream of the electrolyser, the methanol synthesis section allows the production of the liquid fuel used to store energy. The main blocks in the MSS are: the adiabatic reactor, where the catalytic CO2 hydrogenation process is carried out, and the distillation column, where the purification process is carried out [68]. Methanol is produced through the three main reactions of the CO2 hydrogenation process: CO is given by the water gas shift reaction (5) and converted into methanol by the CO hydrogenation reaction (6), while methanol is also produced through the CO2 hydrogenation reaction (7). (5) C O 2 + H 2 ⇄ C O + H 2 O (6) C O + 2 H 2 ⇄ C H 3 O H (7) C O 2 + 3 H 2 ⇄ C H 3 O H + H 2 O The catalytic reaction was simulated through an LHHW kinetic model especially developed in Aspen Plus, following the information reported in Van-Dal and Bouallou [68] and Al-Malah [69]. The employed model is a modified version by Mignard and Pritchard [70] of the original Vanden Bussche and Froment [71] kinetic model, that extends the application range up to 7.5 MPa [68]. A detailed description of the process and of the kinetic model used is reported also in Lonis et al. [54]. In this study all the methanol produced in the MSS is used in the SOFC. For the sake of simplicity, the charging and discharging processes are considered of the same duration. The production and consumption of methanol were set considering the fuel cell power of 1 MW. Assuming the stoichiometric molar ratio of reactants (reaction (7)), this corresponds to 75.6 kg/h of hydrogen and 550.5 kg/h of CO2 (equal to about 840 and 280 N m 3 / h , respectively), from which 371.6 kg/h of methanol are produced. The methanol synthesis reactor operates at 6.5 MPa requiring the hydrogen and CO2 to be compressed. While the CO2 compressor train is composed of three compressors characterised by an intercooling temperature of 38 °C and a compression ratio of about 4, the number of compressors for the H2 depends on the operating electrolysis pressure. In particular, three different configurations were analysed for the alkaline electrolyser: a) AEL operating pressure of 0.5 MPa and two intercooled compressors in the MSS, b) AEL operating pressure of 0.5 MPa and three intercooled compressors in the MSS, and c) AEL operating pressure of 2.5 MPa and one compressor in the MSS. Table 3 summarises the power requirements of the compressors for the different configurations. The configuration with one compressor allows saving about 70 kW in comparison to that with multiple compressors. This value compensates for the larger AEL power absorption in case of 2.5 MPa operation (72.5 kW, as shown in Fig. 4). Hence, to reduce the complexity of the system, 2.5 MPa was chosen as operating pressure of the AEL, allowing the use of only one compressor in the MSS. Since the compression power required by the CO2 is equal to 56 kW the total power absorbed by the compressors in the MSS is about 94 kW. The MSS simplified functional scheme is presented in Fig. 6 . The compressed H2 (2M) and CO2 (5M) are mixed with the re-circulated gases (23M) and preheated (H1M) to 210 °C prior to entering the synthesis reactor (R1M). Within the adiabatic reactor, the exothermal CO2 hydrogenation reaction increases the temperature up to 290 °C. The reactor outlet is mainly composed of hydrogen (about 77% by vol), whereas the methanol content is lower than 4% by volume (Table 4 ). To boost the production of methanol, two flash processes are performed (F1M and F2M) and the un-reacted incondensable gases (18M and 21M) are re-circulated back to the reactor. The first flash occurs at 6.5 MPa, after reducing the temperature to 50 °C in a cooler (C1M). The second flash process takes place reducing the pressure and temperature of the liquid stream to about 0.12 MPa and 22 °C. The resulting liquid product (12M), namely crude methanol, is mainly composed of methanol and water (both about 49% by vol) with a small content of CO2. To boost the methanol purity, the separation of water and methanol takes place in a distillation column (D1M). The distillate at the top of the column (14M) is a mixture of methanol and CO2, with a methanol purity of 96.4% (by volume). Subsequently methanol and CO2 are easily separated by condensing the former. To avoid CO2 emissions from the distillation column, the CO2 in the distillate (16M) is recycled to the inlet and mixed along with fresh CO2 (3M). Since the reactor products are characterized by a high temperature (about 280 °C), they can be employed to provide heat to some processes within the MSS, reducing the thermal energy that otherwise would be provided by an external source. In particular, thermal energy is required by the following MSS processes: • the preheating of the reactants (13M) from 120 to 210 °C, • the distillation process (occurring at 100 °C), • the heating of crude methanol up to the inlet temperature of the distillation column (80 °C). 3.2.1 Thermal integration of the methanol synthesis section Fig. 7 shows the simplified functional scheme of the methanol synthesis section taking into account the thermal integrations within the section. Firstly, the reactor products are cooled from 280 °C (8M) to 188 °C (8M-1) releasing about 248 kW to the reactants (HX1M). Then, the reactor products release 182 KW in the distillation column (D1M), reducing their temperature to 128 °C). Finally, the reactor products (8M-2) are cooled to about 110 °C (HX2M) with the preheating of the crude methanol (12M) and allowing a recovery of roughly 132 kW. To reach the first flash condition (50 °C), roughly 245 kW should be further removed from the reactor products in the cooler C1M. Globally, a total power of approximately 565 kW is recovered and exploited within the MSS, reaching the thermal self-sustainability of the section. In Table 4 the heating and cooling processes within the MSS are summarised."
5,Modelling of the solid oxide fuel cell,"3.3 Modelling of the solid oxide fuel cell Solid oxide fuel cells typically operate in a temperature range between 700 and 1000 °C. The high temperature operation guarantees high efficiencies thanks to better reaction kinetics and lower electrochemical losses. In addition, being composed of ceramic materials and metal alloys, SOFC are not subjected to deactivation and CO poisoning and can operate with a variety of fuels, with different grades of purity. Solid oxide fuel cells produce electricity following reactions (8) and (9): (8) 2 H 2 + 2 O 2 - → 2 H 2 O + 4 e - (9) 2 O 2 + 4 e - → 2 O 2 - To simulate the operation of the SOFC an electrochemical model derived from Ni et al. [72] was implemented within the Aspen Plus environment. Three main equations were considered to simulate the SOFC. A comprehensive description of the adopted model and used parameters can be found in Lonis et al. [54]. The SOFC produces 1 MWel. Given a cell area of 325 cm2, through the polarisation curves a total of 10,000 cells were calculated. The operating current density at 850 °C and 0.1 MPa is approximately 4800 A/m2 with a current of approximately 155 A flowing in each cell. The operating voltage of a single cell is 0.644 V. The SOFC is fed by methanol that is reformed outside the reactor along with water to produce the hydrogen required for the SOFC reactions. The SOFC is also fed by air to provide the required oxygen. To guarantee the design power production of 1 MW, a methanol flow rate of 370 kg/h is required, corresponding to the methanol production in the MSS, since the duration of the charging and discharging processes are assumed to be the same. The water flow rate is obtained setting a steam to carbon ratio equal to 1.25 [73] in the reformer. Fig. 8 represents the simplified functional scheme of the SOFC. The cell operates at ambient pressure. Methanol (1F) and water (3F) are vaporised (H1F and H2F) and then mixed with a fraction of the high-temperature SOFC anode exhaust (9F), allowing the mixture (5F) to reach the reforming temperature, set equal to 300 °C. Then, following the methanol reforming reactions (RF1F) (opposite of the reactions (5)–(7)) a hydrogen-rich mixture (6F, H2 content approximately 64% by vol) is obtained. The SOFC (R1F) temperature is set equal to 850 °C, with a fuel utilisation factor of 0.85 [74]. The heat necessary for the cell processes is obtained from the exothermic reaction in the cell itself. In particular, methanol (H1F) and water (H2F) preheating and vaporisation, reforming reactions (RF1F), reformed gas (H3F) and air (H4F) heating up to the cell temperature. The residual anode exhaust gases (10F), mainly composed of H2 and CO, are burnt in a post combustor (PC1F), along with the air leaving the cathode (18F), increasing the exhaust temperature up to about 990 °C. The exhaust gases (11F) are firstly used to preheat (HX1F) the inlet air (15F) and then to feed (HX2F) an ORC engine and improve the overall production of electricity during the discharge phase. Methanol and water preheating and vaporisation require around 125 and 115 kW, respectively, while the reforming reactions absorbs slightly more than 210 kW and the reformed gas requires about 290 kW to be heated up to SOFC operating temperature. Since the total available thermal power in the cell is equal to about 980 kW, a residual 235 kW is still available, allowing an increase of the air temperature from about 760 °C to 850 °C. The air preheating from 25 to 760 °C requires about 1765 kW from the exhaust gases, leaving a further 700 kW available for feeding the ORC engine."
6,Organic Rankine cycle,"3.4 Organic Rankine cycle Since there is a high residual thermal energy in the exhaust of the SOFC, it is possible to introduce an ORC in the system. Like steam plants, ORC systems are based on a Rankine cycle, but being the working fluid an organic compound rather than water, ORCs are capable to conveniently exploit even minor amount of heat available at low temperature (usually below 350 °C). An ORC is relatively simple being composed of an evaporator, a turbine, a condenser, a pump, and a regenerator [75]. A simplified functional scheme of the model of the ORC, as it was developed in Aspen Plus, is reported in Fig. 9 . The working fluid as saturated liquid (1O) is pumped (P1O) to the maximum pressure of the cycle (2O). Then, it is preheated in a regenerator (REGEN) before entering an evaporator (EVA-HX2F) where it is heated up to the maximum temperature of the cycle (4O) through the heat released by the cooling of the hot SOFC exhaust (12F-SOFC). Then, the working fluid expands in a turbine (TO) producing electricity. The relatively high temperature of the turbine exhaust (5O) allows the preheating of the working fluid (2O) in the regenerator. Finally, exploiting cold water or air (7O), the working fluid (6O) condensates at the minimum pressure in the condenser (COND). Given the low temperature and mass flow of the available heat source (i.e. the hot gases coming from the SOFC section), this simple ORC configuration was chosen instead of a more complex layout (i.e. multi pressure level cycles, trilateral cycles, etc.). Given the temperature of the hot source (about 380 °C), three potential working fluids were analysed, namely benzene, toluene, butylbenzene [76,77]. These three fluids are characterised by different properties as reported in Table 5 . For each fluid, operating values of pressure and temperature are chosen to assure a complete vaporisation of the working fluid before entering the turbine. A comparison between these working fluids was carried out. Benzene was found to provide the highest efficiency (consistently with Viktor et al. [77]), thanks to both its high critical pressure (4.89 MPa) and low critical temperature (289 °C) [78]. Consequently, benzene was chosen as the organic fluid in this application. Even though benzene was chosen, it should be considered that it is a highly flammable and highly toxic compound that must be carefully handled and used [79]. Maximum cycle pressure and temperature were set to 4.65 MPa and 289 °C. The pressure at the condenser was set slightly higher than 0.02 MPa. A minimum temperature difference of 30 °C in the evaporator was set, leading to an outlet temperature of the hot source (13F-SOFC) of about 115 °C. Globally, the ORC turbine produces about 210 kW, since the ORC harvests approximately 700 kW from the available hot source, and an ORC efficiency of about 0.30 was calculated."
7,System based on a reversible solid oxide cell,"A configuration based on innovative technologies was considered for case B. In particular, the overall system is composed of three main sections: • A high-temperature RSOC, operating both in electrolyser mode (SOEC) and fuel cell mode (SOFC), depending on RES availability; • A methanol synthesis and purification section; • A thermal energy storage system. While the overall energy required by any electrolysis process to split water is almost constant, in high temperature processes (as in SOEC) the consumption of high-quality energy (i.e. electricity) remarkably decreases, so improving the efficiency in comparison to low-temperature ones. Conversely, in the SOEC the requirements of lower quality energy (i.e. heat) increases, necessitating an external source. Hence, the heat released by the SOFC exhaust can be accumulated in a TES system to be used during SOEC operation. As assumed in the previous case, the RSOC-based system was sized considering a design power of the SOFC of 1 MWe, requiring a methanol flow rate of approximately 370 kg/h. The flow rates of the main streams (namely air, water and CO2) feeding the other sections were calculated to guarantee the desired methanol production."
8,Modelling of the reversible solid oxide cells,"4.1 Modelling of the reversible solid oxide cells As well as other equipment, the models of the RSOC were developed in Aspen Plus environment to simulate both the water splitting and the fuel oxidation. The model of the SOEC was derived from the one originally developed by Ni et al. [80]. The main difference with the model developed to simulate the SOFC regards the overvoltages, that in the SOEC are summed to the equilibrium voltage rather than subtracted, as shown by Eq. (10). More details on the parameters and on the model used to simulate the SOEC can be found in Lonis et al. [54]. (10) E SOEC = E eq + η act + η conc an + η act + η conc cat + η ohm To avoid thermal management issues and material deterioration over time, the operating temperature of the RSOC (in both modes) was limited to 850 °C. The operating pressure was set equal to the ambient one. Indeed, high pressure brings about problems in the cells materials, and increases the complexity of the overall system, while reducing its reliability [81]. Moreover, high pressure can bring about premature break of the cells due to pressure gradients [82]. At the selected operating conditions, thermo-neutral operation is performed, avoiding external heat requirements. Fig. 10 represents the simplified functional scheme of the model developed in Aspen Plus. On the cathode side, the water (1ES) preheating, vaporisation and superheating (H1ES) take place. Since a feed composition of 90% water, 10% hydrogen ([83]) is set for the cell, a fraction of the cathode exhaust (9ES) is mixed (M1ES) with the vapour (2ES). Then, the mixture is electrolysed in the reactor (R1ES) and hydrogen and oxygen are produced. On the anode side, the sweep air (4ES) is heated (H2ES) from ambient temperature up to 850 °C. Both the hydrogen-water mixture (10ES) and the outlet air (6ES) are cooled to ambient temperature and the released heat is recovered to reduce the overall thermal energy requirement of the SOEC. Since a water utilisation factor of 0.85 is assumed, a water flowrate of 780 kg/h is required to produce the hydrogen for the MSS (76 kg/h). The SOEC requires an electric power of approximately 2.5 MWe. Given the same cell area already presented for the SOFC (325 cm2) and a total of 10,000 cells, a current of about 200 A is necessary, with a corresponding current density of 6200 A/m2. The operating voltage of single cell in SOEC mode is 1.256 V 4.1.1 Thermal integration of the reversible solid oxide cell The SOEC performance was improved through an internal heat recovery. Fig. 11 shows the simplified functional scheme of the SOEC section with thermal integration. On the anode side, the hot (850 °C) exhausts (6ES) preheat the sweep air (4ES) up to 800 °C in HX4ES (setting to 50 °C the minimum temperature difference between the hot inlet and the cold outlet). Coupling the cold sweep air to the anode exhaust allows the recovery of approximately 200 kW. In addition, to complete the heating process of the sweep air a further 15 kW must be provided by an additional heater (H3ES). Since the anode exhaust (6ES) is composed of both the sweep air and the oxygen produced in the SOEC, preheating the sole sweep air cools it down just to about 405 °C (7ES), allowing a further heat recovery. On the cathode side, the water (1ES) is preheated, vaporised and superheated through two different sources. A fraction of the water flow rate (1ES-1, about 185 out of the total 780 kg/h) is preheated and vaporised in HX1ES exploiting the residual heat of the hot anode exhaust (7ES). The remainder (1ES-3) is preheated and vaporised in HX2ES by harvesting the heat stored in the TES system during discharge mode operation of the RSOC. Approximately 425 kW are recovered with this integration. Then, the saturated water vapour is superheated (HX3ES) to about 680 °C exploiting the hot cathode exhaust (10ES, composed of hydrogen and water), saving approximately 260 kW. An external heater (H4ES) is still required to reach the SOEC operating temperature (850 °C), absorbing a power of 85 kW. In addition, as previously specified, a portion of the cathode exhaust (9ES) is recycled to the reactor (R1ES) inlet. Table 6 summarises the energy balances of the heating and cooling processes within the SOEC system."
9,MSS and SOFC (RSOC),"4.2 MSS and SOFC (RSOC) The MSS in the RSOC-based system differs from the one in the AEL-based system only regarding the hydrogen compression train. Indeed, since the RSOC operates at ambient pressure, the produced hydrogen must be compressed from 0.1 to 6.5 MPa. Consequently, In the RSOC-based system, three compressors with an intercooling temperature of 38 °C and a compression ratio of 4.02 were considered for both the hydrogen and the CO2. The SOFC section is almost identical to that of the AEL-based configuration, so no further information is provided here. The only difference is that the thermal energy of the SOFC exhaust does not feed an ORC, but it is stored in a TES system and used subsequently to vaporise the water in the electrolyser during the charge mode. A thermal power equal to 425 kW must be stored in the TES system during SOFC operation to complete the water vaporisation process during SOEC operation (Table 6, HX2ES). The remaining thermal energy would be scarce and available at low temperature, so the possibility of feeding an ORC was not contemplated in this configuration."
10,Thermal energy storage system,"4.3 Thermal energy storage system Among different technologies, in this study, a latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) system based on a tank filled by a phase change material (PCM) was chosen to transfer thermal energy from the RSOC in SOFC-mode to the RSOC in SOEC-mode. Fig. 12 shows a simplified scheme of the thermal energy storage section with the interactions between the TES and a gas–water heat exchanger (GWHX). During the TES charging phase, the hot exhausts from the SOFC enter from the top of the TES, releasing thermal energy to the PCM that melts. Then the hot exhausts leave the bed from the bottom of the tank. Conversely, during the TES discharging phase, the direction of the flow is reversed, recovering the heat from the PCM. The air, used as an intermediate heat transfer fluid, circulates in a closed loop and, inside the GWHX, it releases the heat gained from the TES to the water feeding the SOEC. Approximately 50 kW are necessary to vent the air in the circuit. The LHTES was preliminary designed through a numerical simulation model developed in MATLAB-Simulink and based on a transient one-dimensional (1-D) two-equation model (LTNE). The optimal size and configuration of the TES and the thermal behaviour of the storage unit can be found analysing and calculating the temperature profile of both the heat thermal fluid (HTF) and of the PCM. The single tank, based on a packed bed configuration, is assumed to be filled by a PCM held in capsules 50 mm in diameter. The bed is assumed to be porous, homogeneous and isotropic, with negligible energy losses, while the radial temperature profile is set constant to calculate the shape of the thermocline along the bed. A detailed description of the developed model can be found in previous papers by the same authors [84,85]. Given the initial temperature of the hot source (about 380 °C), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) contained in stainless steel [86–88] was identified as a suitable PCM for this application. The phase change temperature of the NaOH is equal to 318 °C, the latent heat of fusion to 165 k J / k g and the mean density is 2100 k g / m 3 [89]. A deeper analysis of this TES system is reported in [90]."
11,Results and discussion,"Several performance indices were developed to study and compare the two different analysed systems. In particular, performance indices were defined for each section consistently with respect to the interrelationships between the various sections and to the overall system. In this sense, the efficiency of the electrolyser η ele , valid for both the alkaline electrolyser and the solid oxide one, is defined by Eq. (11) [91]: (11) η ele = m ̇ H 2 ∙ LHV H 2 P ele + P BOP , e l e where m ̇ H 2 is the hydrogen flow rate while LHV H 2 is the lower heating value, P ele is the power consumption of the electrolyser, and P BOP , e l e is the auxiliaries electrical requirements, respectively. The SOFC efficiency η SOFC is defined by Eq. (12), considering the net power of the SOFC and the chemical power of the methanol entering the section m ̇ MeOH ∙ LHV MeOH : (12) η SOFC = P SOFC - P BOP , S O F C m ̇ MeOH ∙ LHV MeOH The efficiency of the MSS is defined by Eq. (13) [92]: (13) η MSS = m ̇ MeOH ∙ LHV MeOH m ̇ H 2 ∙ LHV H 2 + E ̇ MSS + P BOP , M S S in which the term E ̇ MSS is the external supply for H2 and CO2 preheating, while the term P BOP , M S S is the requirement of the auxiliaries. A chemical energy conversion efficiency of the MSS can also be defined similarly to a “cold gas” efficiency of a gasifier [93], that is the ratio between the chemical power of the methanol and the chemical power of the hydrogen, as reported in Eq. (14) [54]: (14) η MSS , C = m ̇ MeOH ∙ LHV MeOH m ̇ H 2 ∙ LHV H 2 A global efficiency η G can be defined for the overall system according to Eq. (15) [54]: (15) η G = P SOFC - P BOP , S O F C P ele + P BOP , e l e + E ̇ MSS + P BOP , M S S The global efficiency can be also obtained by the following Eq. (16), by combining Eq. (15) with Eqs. (11), (12) and (14) and rearranging the various terms: (16) η G = η ele ∙ η SOFC ∙ η MSS , C ∙ φ ele being: (17) φ ele = P ele + P BOP , e l e P ele + P BOP , e l e + E ̇ MSS + P BOP , M S S where φ ele represents ratio between the power supply of the electrolyser and the total power required by the overall system. A further alternative expression of the global efficiency, as reported by Eq. (18), can be obtained by combining Eq. (16) with Eq. (13): (18) η G = η ele , R ∙ η SOFC ∙ η MSS where η ele , R is a rectified efficiency of the electrolyser given by Eq. (19): (19) η ele , R = m ̇ H 2 ∙ LHV H 2 + ( E ̇ MSS + P BOP , M S S ) P ele + P BOP , e l e + ( E ̇ MSS + P BOP , M S S ) Obviously, the rectified efficiency of the electrolyser η ele , R coincides with the efficiency η ele when the MSS does not require an external power supply. By the way, it can be observed that adding the same quantity E ̇ MSS + P BOP , M S S to numerator and denominator in Eq. (15), results η ele , R > η ele . Furthermore, the correlation between the relevant efficiency parameters of the comprehensive electrolyser-MSS system is highlighted in the following Eq. (20), by combining Eqs. (16) and (18): (20) η ele ∙ φ ele ∙ η MSS , C = η ele , R ∙ η MSS Finally, a power-to-liquid efficiency η PtL is defined by Eq. (21): (21) η PtL = m ̇ MeOH ∙ LHV MeOH P ele + P BOP , e l e + E ̇ MSS + P BOP , M S S In case of RSOC-based configuration, the presence of the ORC brings about a variation in the efficiency of the power production section η SOFC + O R C and of the global efficiency η G . The modified equations are (22) and (23): (22) η SOFC + O R C = P SOFC - P BOP , S O F C + P ORC - P BOP , O R C m ̇ MeOH ∙ LHV MeOH (23) η G = P SOFC - P BOP , S O F C + P ORC - P BOP , O R C P ele + P BOP , e l e + E ̇ MSS + P BOP , M S S The terms P ORC and P BOP , O R C are the electric power produced by the ORC and its balance of plant, respectively. The values of the terms used to calculate the performance indices previously described for both the AEL-based system and the RSOC-based system. are reported in Table 7 . Given the low operating temperature of the AEL, the power consumed to perform the electrolysis is almost 1 MW higher than that consumed in the SOEC, because the latter operates at high temperature and a remarkable portion of the required heat is provided by the TES charged during SOFC operation. Given the considerations on the design and sizing of the system, the hydrogen and methanol chemical power are the same in both the AEL and the SOEC-based systems, as well as the power entering (chemical) and produced (electrical) by the SOFC. In both cases, the MSS external energy term E ̇ MSS is zero because it was possible, with a wise exploitation of the heat available within the section, to make the MSS self-sustainable. Table 8 summarises the performance indices of each section and of the overall system for both studied configurations. As it was expected, the electrolyser based on solid oxide cells showed a higher efficiency (0.960) than the alkaline one (0.730), thanks to the high operating temperature that allows for lower electricity consumption. The efficiency of the methanol synthesis section resulted larger in the AEL-based system because the electrolyser operates at high pressure (2.5 MPa), reducing both the number of compressors in the MSS and the total power consumption, saving more than 70 kW. Despite a lower MSS efficiency, since the power-to-liquid efficiency is directly related to the efficiencies of both the electrolyser and the MSS, its value is higher for the RSOC-based system (0.710 vs 0.573), because the electrolyser efficiency η ele is significantly higher than that of the AEL. Since the introduction of the ORC increases the power production of about 20%, η SOFC + O R C in the AEL-based system is remarkably higher (0.592) than the corresponding η SOFC (0.467) in the RSOC-based system. Finally, even though the efficiency of the SOEC is significantly larger than that of the AEL, the two configurations show similar global efficiencies. In particular, the global efficiency of the AEL-based system (0.339) is only 0.7 percentage point higher than that of the SOEC-based system (0.332)."
12,Conclusion,"Given the rising climate challenge related to CO2 emissions, power-to-X processes are an interesting solution to reduce the overall emissions of CO2 in the atmosphere, by exploiting renewable energy to produce different types of chemical compounds to be used as fuels or as chemicals in the industry in substitution of fossil-derived products. Coupling renewable H2 production with recycled CO2 could be employed to create a closed carbon cycle where the CO2 in atmosphere is used to build carbon-based compounds. In this paper, two different integrated energy systems for the production and use of renewable methanol through water electrolysis and CO2 hydrogenation were analysed and compared. In the first, the water electrolysis is carried out in an AEL coupled to a methanol synthesis section to produce clean methanol to be stored and then used in a SOFC. In the second, the system was supposed to be based on a high temperature reversible solid oxide cell (RSOC), capable of operating alternatively as an SOEC and as an SOFC, reducing the number of components. In the case of the AEL-based plant, an ORC was also introduced to boost the electricity, while in the case of the RSOC-based system, a TES was considered to recover waste heat during discharge mode and provide it during charge mode. Several coherent performance indices were specifically defined to compare the two overall systems and their subsections. The system was sized to produce a power of 1 MW in fuel cell operation, requiring a power of about 3.5 MW in case of AEL and 2.5 MW for the SOEC. The introduction of the ORC leads to an increase of the overall electricity production of 210 kW, whereas the TES allows the recovery of 425 kW of heat, reducing SOEC requirements. The efficiency calculated for the AEL (0.73), the SOEC (0.96) and the SOFC (0.47), as well as the power-to-liquid efficiency (ranging from 0.57 to 0.71), are consistent with literature data. The global efficiency of the two systems was almost the same, with the AEL-based system characterised by a slightly higher efficiency (0.339) than the RSOC-based system (0.332). Since the difference between the two configurations is minor, other aspects should be taken into account. For instance, the solid oxide cells (SOEC/SOFC) and the alkaline cells are not at the same technology readiness level. While the former is still not commercially mature with a TRL of 6–7, and is expected to reach a TRL of 9 by the 2030 [94], the latter is already largely diffused and commercially available. However, since also the power-to-methanol process employing captured CO2 and renewable energy is at a TRL of 6–7 [95], a binary technological improvement of the solid oxide cells and renewable power-to-methanol technologies might be expected, leading to a harmonised progress of both the single technologies and the overall system. Another aspect to be considered, but not investigated in this paper, is related to the costs of the PtL technologies. Indeed, the main drawback of such systems consists of their high cost, due to the electricity production from RES and the capital cost of the electrolysers. For instance, SOEC methanol production processes are approximately 15 times more expensive than conventional methanol production from fossil fuels [42]. In addition, even though RES is becoming more convenient than conventional electricity production, the costs related to the electrolysers, both AEL and SOEC/RSOC technology, remains remarkably large. Schimdt et al [43] provided a capital cost estimation of 1000–1200 €/kW for the AEL and higher than 2000 €/kW for the SOEC technology. Nonetheless, in a future perspective these costs are expected to drop sensibly [42–45]. In addition, a large reduction in SOC costs is expected, with values comparable to those of alkaline and PEM cells by 2030 [42,43]. Pérez-Fortes et al. [96] analysed a methanol production facility that recycles CO2 from a conventional power plant using conventional CCU technology. The system resulted economically unfeasible owing to the high costs of H2 production and CO2 capture with the available technology. Hence, the feasibility of the production of methanol from these raw materials is directly related to the development of the technologies used to gather the feedstock. Clearly, if a serious R&D effort is put into the technological progress on this fields, the costs might be lowered enough to guarantee the economic feasibility of this methanol production approach. Nowadays, even though the costs of renewable methanol production are still too high to represent a competitive and feasible solution to the climate change, such a technology would play a fundamental role in the decarbonisation of society. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a complete desertion of the conventional fuel technologies in the short period. Indeed, the use of liquid and gaseous fuels should still be expected for many years from now. For instance, renewable methanol might be used, as already happens in Iceland, to fuel vehicles with a net CO2 emission equal to zero while using existing technologies (internal combustion engines or fuel cells). This solution, in the long term, is more sustainable than substituting all vehicles with electric alternatives. Finally, the CCU application analysed in this work and in numerous other studies, should be used side by side with CCS technologies, to both create a closed carbon cycle (avoiding the emission of new carbon in the atmosphere) and reduce the overall amount of CO2 in the atmosphere (CCS)."
