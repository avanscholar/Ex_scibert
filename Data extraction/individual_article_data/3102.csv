0,Introduction,"The exploration of alternative jet fuel, which is a complex mixture of primarily n/iso-paraffins, cycloparaffins, and alkylbenzenes with a carbon number range of 9–15, has been drawing worldwide attention because of the double threats of petroleum shortage and environmental concerns [1,2]. The levy of carbon tax further accelerates the development of jet fuel from renewable resources [3]. A lot of studies has been carried out to produce jet fuel from lipids, sugars and lingo-cellulosic biomass. Among several proposed renewable jet fuel production technologies [4–13], Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) was the most studied route and already commercialized. Using a 50/50 (v/v) blend of petroleum-based and lipid-based jet fuels for flight was already approved by American Society for Testing Material (ASTM) committee. However, lack of raw materials and relatively low jet fuel yield of this process limit its application. Medium chain fatty alcohols (MCFAs), with straight hydrocarbon chains ranging from C9 to C15, can be produced either through processing natural fats and oils (e.g., coconut oil, palm kernel oil, cottonseed oil, rice bran oil, etc.) or from petrochemicals (e.g., crude oil and natural gas). MCFAs can also be synthesized by microorganisms from glucose or even CO2 [14–17]. For example, Tan et al. successfully produced pentadecanol by overexpressing acetyl-CoA carboxylase in cyanobacteria [16]. Furthermore, fatty alcohol is a potential intermediate in other biofuel production processes. For instance, Anbarasan et al. reported the integration of biological and chemo-catalytic routes to efficiently convert ABE fermentation products into ketones with carbon numbers in the range of jet fuel or gasoline by a palladium-catalyzed alkylation. During further hydro-deoxygenation of these ketones, fatty alcohol is formed as an intermediate [18–20]. The n/iso-paraffin, which has a higher energy density because of a high ratio of H/C in comparison to other composition, accounts for up to 50–70 vol% in typical jet fuels. Compared with n-paraffin, iso-paraffin with the same carbon number has a lower freezing point. Thus, the percentage of iso-paraffin in jet fuel is an important factor to evaluate the property of jet fuel [10,11]. A lot of researches have been conducted on the hydro-isomerization of n-paraffin to the corresponding iso-paraffin, of which the catalyst is always bi-functional metal/acid catalyst with porous materials such as ZSM-22 and mesoporous materials as support [21–24]. However, few studies have focused on the hydro-isomerization of fatty alcohol to iso-paraffin. During the conversion of fatty alcohol to iso-paraffin, dehydration and sketch isomerization is necessary. Such a conversion can be realized by selective dehydration and hydro-processing. In this paper, the catalytic performances of different catalysts in dehydration (ZSM-22, Al-MCF and ZSM-5) and hydro-isomerization (Pt/ZSM-22 and Pt/MCF) reactions were firstly studied. Based on the relationship between structure and performance, flexible integrated processes from medium fatty alcohol to jet fuel were proposed. Finally, the dehydration (Al-MCF)/hydro-isomerization (Pt/ZSM-22) process, which provides the highest iso-paraffin yield, was used for conversion of a commercially available alcohol mixture in a pilot scale reactor."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,2.1 Materials The materials used in this study including n-decanol and 1-octene were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The n-C12-based mixture of n-C8 to n-C18 fatty alcohols was purchased from Zhejiang Lanxi Chemical Works. ZSM-22 and aluminum incorporated mesocellulous silica foams (Al-MCF) were synthesized in our lab and ZSM-5 (CBV8014) was purchased from Zeolyst International.
3,Synthesis of catalyst,"2.2 Synthesis of catalyst Proton form of the commercial ZSM-5 (CBV8014) was obtained by ammonium ion exchange (three times) with NH4NO3 (1mol/L) under reflux conditions at 80°C for 2h followed by calcination at 550°C for 4h. Al-MCF and ZSM-22 were synthesized according to pervious publications [23–25]. The synthetic method of Al-MCF was briefly shown here as an example. 5g of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene was added into a solution containing 4g of P123, 10mL of HCl (37wt.%), and 65mL of water. After the solution was heated to 40°C under reflux conditions for 2h, 9.2mL of tetraethoxysilane was then added and kept at 40°C for 20h. The resulting solution was then transferred into an autoclave and 46mg of NH4F was added. Then, the autoclave was placed at 140°C for 24h. The precipitate was subjected to a sequence of filtration, washing with water and ethanol, drying at 80°C for 1h, and calcining at 550°C for 4h to form MCF. A certain amount of MCF was added to a mixture of AlCl3-ethanol and stirred at room temperature for 12h. The Si/Al ratio was controlled to be 10. Al-MCF was thus obtained by drying the resulting solid at 130°C for 1h and calcination at 550°C for 4h. Ammonium ion exchanges (three times) were also conducted for Al-MCF with NH4NO3 (1mol/L) at room temperature for 4h followed by calcination at 550°C for 4h. In order to obtain the bi-functional catalyst for hydro-isomerization reaction, Pt was introduced by the incipient wetness impregnation method [26]. Following the impregnation step, the solid was calcined at 420°C for 4h to form Pt/ZSM-22 and Pt/Al-MCF, respectively. All of the catalysts used in this study were shaped and subsequently crushed to 20–40mesh."
4,Characterization of the catalysts,"2.3 Characterization of the catalysts X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out in a Bruker diffractometer with CuKα radiation (45kV, 200mA), data was recorded in the 2 Theta range of 5–50° with an angular step size of 0.05 and a counting time of 8s per step. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was obtained with a FEI Tecnai G2 20S Twin microscope operated at 200kV. High resolution TEM analysis was carried out with a JEOL 3010F micro-scope. Before TEM investigation, samples were dispersed in ethanol, and then deposited on a holey film supported of a lacey support films. During TEM analysis, large specimen was investigated and representative TEM images were recorded. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements were performed on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 HD 88 surface area and porosity analyzer. The calcined samples were degassed at 350°C in a vacuum of 1.33×10−3 Pa for 10h and then switched to the analysis station for adsorption-desorption analysis at −196°C. Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) was carried out in an Micromeritics Autochem 2910 II instrument. During analysis, 0.1g catalyst was pretreated at 400°C in He flow (20mL/min) for 2h. Afterward, 10 vol% NH3 in He (20mL/min) was adsorbed at 200°C for 30min followed by He purging at the same temperature for 1h. NH3 was desorbed in range 100–600°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min. 27Al nuclear magnetic resonance measurements with the magic angle sample spinning (27Al MAS NMR) were performed at on a Bruker Advanced 300 spectrometer. The spectra were measured at 78.2 mHz using a 4mm MAS probe at 8kHz MAS spinning frequency under the room temperature. The parameters were as following: the pulse length of the selective 10° pulse was 0.5μs, the repetition time to complete the spin lattice relaxation was 4s; 64 scans were accumulated. The 27Al chemical shifts were referenced using the narrow AlO6 signal of YAG set to δ (27Al)=0.6ppm calibrated against a 1M Al (NO3)3 aqueous solution. Fourier transform infrared measurements were performed on a Nicolet Magna-IR 750 spectrometer in KBr pellets. 10mg of sample was pressed into a self-supporting wafer, which was then evacuated in situ at 500°C for 2h in an IR cell. When the temperature was cooled to about 25°C, Pyridine was then introduced into the cell until the saturated adsorption was reached. Finally, adsorbed pyridine was desorbed at 150°C, 350°C and 450°C in vacuum respectively, and the FT-IR spectra were then recorded. Spectra at 150°C and 350°C was chosen for giving the total acid amount and middle-strong acid amount, respectively. Peak areas at 1540–1548 and 1445–1460cm−1 were integrated to measure Brønsted acid and Lewis acid sites with coefficient being 1.88 and 1.42, respectively."
5,Dehydration of fatty alcohol,"2.4 Dehydration of fatty alcohol Catalysts used in dehydration process included Al-MCF, ZSM-22, and ZSM-5 (CBV8014). Dehydration of fatty alcohol was conducted in a down-flow fixed bed reactor under ambient pressure using 1g of catalyst, which was settled in the middle of reactor with proper amount of ceramic rings capped with silica wool in the lower part of the reactor. Before reaction, the catalyst was pretreated at 400°C for 3h under a 200mL/minN2 flow. Then the reactor was cooled to reaction temperature, and n-decanol was pumped into a preheater at 280°C, heated into steam and purged into reactor with 200mL/minN2 flow. The dehydration performance over three catalysts at different temperatures were tested. The resulting product was fed into a high pressure fixed bed reactor for hydro-isomerization using metal/acid bifunctional catalyst as described in the section 2.5. The liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) in dehydration reaction was 6h−1. During the dehydration experiments, the liquid product yield is between 90wt% and 95wt%, depending on the catalyst. The content of organic phase in the liquid product is about 84wt%, and the rest is water phase. In the downstream of the reactor, a condenser at −7°C were employed for collecting condensable products, which was sampled per hour and analyzed by GC/MS (Agilent-7890A/5975C) equipped with a capillary column (HP-5, 30m×0.25mm)."
6,Hydro-processing of fatty alcohol and the dehydration products,"2.5 Hydro-processing of fatty alcohol and the dehydration products A down-flow fixed bed reactor similar to dehydration reaction was used in the fatty alcohol hydro-processing. 1g of Pt/ZSM-22 or Pt/Al-MCF, was firstly introduced into the middle part of the reactor and pretreated at 400°C for 3h with H2 flow. After the temperature decreased to the settled reaction temperature, reactant was continuously pumped into the reactor with a rate of 0.1mL/min. The liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) in dehydration reaction was 6h−1, which was determined by a series of screening experiments shown in supporting information (Fig. S1). The system pressure and the H2 flow rate at outlet were controlled by a back pressure valve to 4MPa and 150–200mL/min, respectively. In order to investigate the effects of reaction temperature, hydro-isomerization reactions were carried out at different temperatures, and the products were analyzed according to the methods described in Section 2.4. Isomerization ratio was defined as the ratio of branched alkanes to total alkanes. During the hydro-processing, the liquid product yield is about 97%."
7,Pilot scale dehydration and hydro-processing reaction,"2.6 Pilot scale dehydration and hydro-processing reaction Pilot scale tests of fatty alcohol to jet fuel were also carried out in down-flow fixed bed reactors under optimized conditions (temperature, LHSV and so on). The catalyst volume in both steps are 500mL."
8,Collection of coke precursors from catalyst after dehydration reaction,"2.7 Collection of coke precursors from catalyst after dehydration reaction For coke precursors collection, the catalysts after dehydration reaction were collected and dried in the N2 atmosphere at 100°C. After that, 0.5g of catalysts was dissolved in 8mL of HF solution, and then 15mL of CH2Cl2 was added to the mixture to extract the hydrocarbon residues. The final organic phase was analyzed by GC/MS (Agilent 7890A/5795C) as shown in Section 2.4."
9,Quality assessment of jet fuel products,"2.8 Quality assessment of jet fuel products The jet fuel products were analyzed based on the methods listed in ASTM 7566 Table. The apparatus for freezing point, density meter, distillation, flash point and calorific value analysis were PHASE technology JFA-70Xi, Anton PAAR DMA 4500M, oil product distillation range tester BCZL-8, automatic closing flash point tester BBS-600 and high precision dual-use automatic calorimeter ZDHW, respectively."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Synthesis and characterization of the porous catalytic materials,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization of the porous catalytic materials The catalysts were comprehensively characterized by XRD, NH3-TPD, FT-IR, TEM, and so on. The XRD patterns of synthesized and commercially available support materials are shown in Fig. 1 (a, b). The XRD patterns of ZSM-22 and ZSM-5 show a typical reflection belonging to TON and MFI structures, respectively. The XRD pattern of Al-MCF did not show any diffraction in the range from 5 to 50, which is a typical diffraction region of zeolite materials. Instead, a strong reflection was found in the 2θ of 0.5, indicating the ordered mesoporous structure of this sample. Hence, combining with the TEM results shown in Fig. 2 , the synthesized Al-MCF was found to be an ordered mesoporous material with amorphous wall structure. The textural properties of three support materials were tested by nitrogen physisorption. The nitrogen adsorption isotherms shown in Fig. 1(d) indicated that mesopores were presented in all three support materials as the existence of hysteresis loop in the partial pressure higher than 0.4. The adsorption volume of Al-MCF is much higher than ZSM-22 and ZSM-5. This is also supported by the textural properties data summarized in Table 1 . The micro-structure of support materials was further investigated by TEM investigation and shown in Fig. 2. It can be found that ZSM-22 was aggregate of small zeolite nanorods, and the diameters of ZSM-22 nanorods were about 50nm. The ZSM-5 catalyst was also aggregate of primary particle size of 50–100nm. The TEM images of Al-MCF showed a typical meso-cellar structure. The mesopore diameter of Al-MCF determined by TEM analysis was around 15nm, which was in good agreement with the nitrogen adsorption results. The 27Al NMR spectra of ZSM-5 and ZSM-22 are shown in Fig. S2. Only one peak at 50ppm due to the tetrahedrally coordinated framework aluminum was found in both spectra. The results indicate that there is no extra-framework aluminum in both zeolite samples. The acidic properties of these three materials were analyzed by NH3-TPD and Py-FT-IR methods. In the NH3-TPD curves of zeolitic materials, the peak temperatures were used as an indicator of the acidity strength of the tested samples. Two desorption peaks are found in the NH3-TPD curves of ZSM-5 and ZSM-22, while the Al-MCF samples only show one desorption peak. The presence of acidic sites in Al-MCF also indicated the successful grafting of Al onto the mesopore wall. The acidic types of these three materials were investigated by FT-IR and the result is shown in Fig. 3 . Two temperatures, 150°C and 350°C, were chosen to obtain the desorption data, which could give the total acid amount and the middle-strong acid amount of catalysts, respectively. The semi-quantitative acidic properties of these three catalytic materials were calculated and listed in Table 1. As the result shown, the total amount of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites of Al-MCF can be quantified to 24.1 and 112.5μmol/g. However, the results of ZSM-22 were to be 28.9 and 6.5μmol/g, respectively, which showed more Brønsted acid sites as Al-MCF but hardly any Lewis acid sites. Meanwhile, ZSM-5 had Brønsted acid sites of 61.9μmol/g and Lewis acid sites of 38.7μmol/g. At 350°C, the amount of Lewis acid sites of Al-MCF was quantified to 57.0μmol/g, but ZSM-22 and ZSM-5 showed a small amount of Lewis acid sites, 3.9 and 10.7μmol/g, respectively. The Brønsted acid sites of these three materials (Al-MCF, ZSM-22, and ZSM-5) were increasing in order (4.3μmol/g, 29.8μmol/g, 70.2μmol/g). These results were also fit well with the NH3-TPD data. As shown in Fig. 1(c), the NH3-TPD curve of Al-MCF does not show desorption peak at 450°C, which is characterized by the strong acidic sites. Therefore, ZSM-22 has stronger acidity than Al-MCF because of the more medium-strong acid sites of ZSM-22. Apparently, ZSM-5 has the strongest acidity among these three catalysts."
12,Selective dehydration of medium chain fatty alcohol,"3.2 Selective dehydration of medium chain fatty alcohol To investigate the dehydration activity of the prepared catalysts, a typical medium chain fatty alcohol–n-decanol was used as a model compound in the dehydration reaction. The dehydration results catalyzed by these three porous catalytic materials (Al-MCF, ZSM-22 and ZSM-5) under different reaction temperatures are shown in Fig. 4 . According to the results, the different dehydration products were obtained over different catalysts and under different reaction temperatures. Using ZSM-5 as the dehydration catalyst, the main product was alkene with a conversion being 86% under a reaction temperature of 300°C. However, when the reaction temperature increased to 350°C, the main dehydration products over ZSM–5s were changed into aromatics. The main dehydration products using Al-MCF as catalyst was entirely alkene at both the reaction temperatures (300°C and 350°C). Complete conversion of n-decanol and high alkene selectivity were obtained when the reaction temperature was 350°C. Similar to Al-MCF, the dehydration products over ZSM-22 were mainly alkene, and more sketch isomerization was found over ZSM-22 when compared with Al-MCF. The catalytic performances of the three catalysts can be explained by their acidity and structural properties. Products over Al-MCF were mainly decene, indicating that the hydroxyl (-OH) was successfully removed and no skeletal isomerization took place. Taking the acidity property of Al-MCF into consideration, the skeletal isomerization was catalyzed by middle and strong Brønsted acid sites, what could be proved further by the performance of ZSM-22 and ZSM-5. These two catalysts contained more middle and strong Brønsted acid sites, and correspondingly their products were skeletal isomerized. As the stronger acidity property and the suitable pore structure, ZSM-5 produced benzenes instead of iso-decene at 350°C. Fig. 5 is the detailed GC–MS results of dehydration products on Al-MCF from n-decanol, and various decenes with double bond on different sites were obtained. This suggests the double bond shifts during the reaction. In order to explain the reason of double bond shift, 1-octene was directly introduced into the reactor without catalyst bed. The products in such blank experiment were analyzed by GC–MS and shown in Table S1. Compared with the result obtained from 300°C, more double bond shift products were obtained at 350°C, but its percentage was less than 20%. The results indicated that the double bond shift in dehydration reaction was mainly caused by the acidic sites in the catalysts other than sole thermal effect. Besides the acidic properties, the product distribution also depended on pore structure of the catalysts. Zeolite catalysts have ordered micropore structures, which can offer shape-selective catalytic properties by the size of reactant, product and transition states. In order to verify the effect of micropore shape on catalytic performance, the nature of coke precursors in the used catalyst was studied. Though the dissolution of zeolite in HF and following extraction may change the nature of the retained carbon species, the HF based method is still the most widely used approach to investigate the retained carbon species in zeolite. Hence the coke precursors in zeolite were collected by HF dissolving method and analyzed by GC–MS in the present study. As shown in Fig. S3, retained materials in used ZSM-22 are mainly n-decane and n-octane, and what retained in used ZSM-5 are mainly methylbenzene. Based on this results, it can be concluded that the ZSM-22 offers a unique transition state shape-selectivity which avoids the formation of aromatics. Based on the above results, it can be concluded that the catalytic performance of catalysts in dehydration reaction is correlated with their acidic properties and structural features. Mesoporous Al-MCF with mild acidity can selectively convert the alcohol into straight alkene without isomerization. While the ZSM-22 with high acidity and small one-dimensional micropore is able to produce the branched alkene without extensive formation of aromatics."
13,Hydro-isomerization of n-decanol and dehydrated products over different bifunctional catalysts,"3.3 Hydro-isomerization of n-decanol and dehydrated products over different bifunctional catalysts For hydro-isomerization reaction, Pt was introduced into the acidic support. The Pt content in the bi-functional catalyst was controlled to be 0.5% and confirmed by ICP analysis. Such a loading content was reported to be sufficient for an ideal metal/acid bi-functional catalyst [27]. The prepared Pt/ZSM-22 catalyst was characterized in detail and the results are shown in Fig. 6 . No diffraction peak from the Pt metal was found in the XRD result shown in Fig. 6(a), indicating the high dispersion of Pt on the catalyst support. The TEM image shown in Fig. 6(b) also indicates the high dispersion of Pt metal on the support since about 5nm Pt particles were found. The dispersion of Pt metal was also tested by H2 chemisorption. It can be found that ZSM-22 has a dispersion degree of 0.50, while Al-MCF has a much higher dispersion of 0.90. This can be understood by the different surface properties of the support materials and consequently different metal/surface interactions. This results coincided with our pervious reports [28] and those in the literature [29]. The characterization results of the acidic properties of those two Pt/acid bifunctional catalysts are shown in Fig. 7 , from which similar tendency of the support materials are found. The two catalysts were then used in n-decanol hydro-isomerization. The relationship between n-decanol conversion and reaction temperature over the two catalysts is shown in Fig. 8 (a). It can be found that almost 100% conversion is achieved on both catalysts in the n-decanol reaction. The isomerization degree under different temperatures is shown in Fig. 8(b). In case of Pt/Al-MCF, it can be found the product is mainly n-paraffin with limited iso-branched paraffin (less than 10%). Much higher isomerization degree is found over Pt/ZSM-22, and the isomerization degree can achieve 50% when the temperature is 340°C. The reaction network of n-decanol over a bi-functional metal/acid catalyst can be simplified as Scheme S1, in which the n-decanol was firstly undergone a dehydration step and resulted in decene formation. The decene products has two potential conversion pathways over the bi-functional catalyst. It can undergo olefin isomerization (double bond shift reaction) and directly integrate into the typical alkane through hydro-isomerization reaction. It can also be hydrogenated into alkane and undergone hydro-isomerization through a typical alkane hydro-isomerization reaction. In such a reaction network, the dehydration step and hydro-isomerization step require different acidic properties. Mild acidity was sufficient for the fatty alcohol dehydration while medium or strong acidity is required for the hydro-isomerization reaction. It was thus easily understood the complete conversion of n-decanol over different catalysts while obvious difference observed in the isomerization degrees of the products from the different acidities of catalyst supports and bi-functional catalysts. The highest isomerization degree over the two catalysts in n-decanol is only 60%, which is much lower than the typical isomerization degree in alkane hydro-isomerization under identical reaction conditions [27]. Hence a comparative study of n-decanol and decane hydro-isomerization reaction over Pt/ZSM-22 was carried out. Considering the complete conversion of n-decanol, the isomerization degree under different reaction temperatures of n-decanol and decene reactions were compared and the result is shown in Fig. 9 . It can be found that the isomerization degree in n-decanol reaction is much lower than that in n-decene reaction under similar reaction condition. In the n-decene reaction, the isomerization degree can be as high as 90% at temperatures between 300°C and 340°C. This finding is interesting as the high isomerization level may lead to better low temperature properties of the products. It also indicates that the water produced in the n-decanol conversion process probably influences the performance of the metal/acid bi-functional catalyst. The water produced in hydro-isomerization step can be adsorbed on the acidic sites and decrease the acidity, and may reduce the degree of hydro-isomerization. Furthermore, the presence of water can potentially reduce the adsorption of reactant on the active site in zeolite, which has recently been reported in alkyl-phenol selective cracking [30]. Also, the presence of water possibly induces the growth of noble metal on the bi-functional catalyst in a long-term operation."
14,Different process integrations for jet fuel production from medium chain fatty alcohol,"3.4 Different process integrations for jet fuel production from medium chain fatty alcohol Based on the above findings, several integrated processes from fatty alcohol to iso-alkane were proposed. As showed in Scheme 1 , the first process contains one step reaction with a bifunctional Pt/ZSM-22 catalyst, where fatty alcohol was dehydrated and hydro-isomerized simultaneously. But the water produced during dehydration step would reduce the activity and lifetime of catalyst. The second process consists of two steps, which were dehydration step and hydro-isomerization step. Fatty alcohol was firstly converted into the olefins without the extensive formation of aromatics and cracked on the acidic molecular sieve catalyst,like Al-MCF. Then the obtained olefins, after separation from the water, were introduced into the Pt/ZSM-22 catalyst for hydro-isomerization. Even though process is relatively more complex, water effect can be avoided. In another alternative process, dehydration catalyst can use ZSM-22, isomer-alkene can be obtained in the first step, and then Pt/Al-MCF or commercial Pt/Al2O3 was used for alkene saturation under hydrogen condition."
15,Jet fuel production from industrial fatty alcohol through dehydration/hydro-isomerization approach,"3.5 Jet fuel production from industrial fatty alcohol through dehydration/hydro-isomerization approach The separated dehydration/hydro-isomerization reaction process was then used in a commercial available fatty alcohol feedstock for jet fuel production. The mixed fatty alcohol sample was obtained from an oil processing company located in Zhejiang Province, China. The chemical composition of this mixed fatty alcohol sample consists of C8-C16 alcohols as shown in Table 2 . No detectable metal or other contaminates were found in the alcohol mixture. In lab scale experiments, these catalysts show good stability during reaction periods. Life time tests of some catalysts were carried out. Both dehydration (Al-MCF) and hydro-isomerization (Pt/ZSM-22) show insignificant deactivation after 100h time on stream. Hence in a pilot scale experiment, the mixed fatty alcohol feedstock was subjected to dehydration over Al-MCF and hydro-isomerization over Pt/ZSM-22 in a fixed bed reactor containing 500mL catalyst at 300°C. Taking 1kg mixed fatty alcohol sample into account, 915g liquid product was obtained in the dehydration process, which consisted of 861g organic compounds and 54g water. After hydro-processing process, 836g oil product was finally obtained and used for property determination. An isomerization ratio was found to be 92%, which is coincides with the result obtained in the small scale experiment. Determined by the feedstock composition and reaction chemistry (hydro-isomerization), the carbon distribution in the product was very similar to the feedstock. Hence the oil product was conceptually very suitable as a jet fuel. The quality of the oil product was analyzed according to ASTM 7566 standard and shown in Table 3 . The energy density, total acid number, flash point and freezing point of the product jet fuel are 44.2MJ/Kg, 0mg KOH/g, 42°C and <–60°C, respectively. The only exception of the jet fuel product from the specification is the density, which is slightly lower than the required value. However, this is the common issue in iso-paraffin rich bio-jet fuel, which can be satisfied by blending with aromatics containing petroleum-derived jet fuel and separately aromatic-rich bio-jet fuel components."
16,Conclusion,"The conversion of fatty alcohols with C8-C18 carbon-chains into an iso-paraffin rich jet fuel blend was studied in this paper. Hydro-isomerization reactions with and without dehydration step were designed and realized in this study. Firstly, fatty alcohol can be converted into iso-paraffin rich mixture through one-step hydro-isomerization. The acidity and structure of molecular sieve support affected the isomerization ratio of the products. Secondly, when compared with n-decane, the isomerization degree of n-decanol over the same catalyst was much lower, the reason of which is the water produced in dehydration was adsorbed on the acidic and active sites, and reduced the possibility of hydro-isomerization. Thirdly, a two-catalyst process with a dehydration step followed by hydro-isomerization conversion favors the iso-paraffin production from fatty alcohol. In the first dehydration step, Al-MCF with mild acidity supplies almost 100% conversion of n-decanol to olefins at 350°C, while ZSM-5 with strong acidity is helpful to aromatization of n-decanol. The obtained olefins with Al-MCF catalyst after separation from water was then introduced to hydro-isomerize, and reached a similar i/n ratio to that of n-decane reaction. Finally, the two-catalyst method was used for a commercially available alcohol mixture conversion, and jet fuel satisfied with Jet A specification except for density was produced."
