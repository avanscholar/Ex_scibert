0,Introduction,"On account of the imperious demands for sustainable fuels and chemicals in modern society, considerable interest in current sustainable chemistry has been oriented to the efficient transformation of renewable biomass resources to bulk chemicals and bio-fuels, wherein biomass-derived platform molecules as a bridge linking biomass towards valuable chemicals and fuels [1–12]. As a representative example, biomass-derived γ-valerolactone (GVL) has been identified as an interesting molecule with enormous promising applications in the chemical industries, which can be used as versatile feedstock for the synthesis of fuel additives/fuels (e.g., 2-methyltetrahydrofunan [13], isooctane [14], valeric biofuels [15] and liquid hydrocarbon fuels [16,17]), useful bulk chemicals (e.g., 1,4-pentanediol [18] and aromatic hydrocarbons [19]), and polymers materials (e.g., nylon [20]). Additionally, new applications of GVL recently have been unceasingly reported [21]. GVL, from the perspective of biomass valorization, usually yields from hydrogenation and subsequent cyclization of levulinic acid or its ester [22–24], which is a common derivative from cellulose and hemicellulose after a string of reactions in water or alcohols [25]. Two strategies consisting of direct hydrogenation with H2 gas as H-donor and transfer hydrogenation with liquid molecules (e.g., formic acid, alcohol, and silane) as H-donor have been reported for the production of GVL [26]. Meanwhile, the potential safety hazard posed by the explosive nature of H2 as well as usually involving noble metal catalyst [27,28] has propelled catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) strategy to rapidly develop in the selective hydrogenation of biomass-derived molecules [29–32]. In particular, several advantages of alcohols such as non-corrosive, cheap, and easily accessible properties, as well as a dual role of being H-donor and solvent, have made CTH process more attractive [33,34]. Currently, Lewis acid-containing heterogeneous catalysts have been examined to be capable of catalyzing the hydrogenation-cyclization of alkyl levulinates to GVL with alcohol as H-donor by virtue of hydrogen transfer process based on Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction [35–38]. To date, Zr-based materials are examined to be preferred Lewis catalysts for organic reactions including biomass valorization, which is attributed to the strength and content of Lewis acidic Zr species [39–42]. Some pioneering studies regarding hydrogenation-cyclization of levulinates to GVL catalyzed by Zr-based materials with alcohols as H-donor also have been reported. For instance, ZrO2 [43] and Zr-containing binary oxides [44,45] were developed for the production of GVL from levulinates via CTH process with alcohol as H-donor. However, high reaction temperature (>200 °C) is prerequisite for obtaining satisfactory GVL yields in those catalytic systems due to limited surface areas of the catalysts. To achieve enhancive activity, loading ZrO2 onto SBA-15 (ZrO2/SBA-15) [46,47] and incorporating Zr into zeolite (Zr-Beta) [48] with the aim of improving active-site accessibility have been conducted and used for GVL production. Nevertheless, ZrO2/SBA-15 catalyst suffered from an obvious decline in activity during recycling experiments [46], and Zr-Beta was subjected to long crystallization time (e.g., 20 days) during preparation process [48], thereby constituting major challenges for their practical applications. Accordingly, developing a stable heterogeneous catalyst by a facile method, while preserving a high activity toward GVL, is still significant interest in the production of GVL from levulinates via CTH process using alcohol as H-donor. In comparison with levulinates, furfural as a substrate for GVL production is more industrially preferable because of simplifying separation and purification of intermediates [49–53]. Especially, the one-pot transformation of furfural to GVL involves tandem reactions composed of hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol, followed by ring-opening to levulinate, and subsequent hydrogenation-cyclization to GVL (Scheme 1 ). A combination of Lewis and Brønsted acidic sites was reported to be capable of producing GVL via these sequential catalytic processes. For instance, 62% yield of GVL was attained from furfural in 2-butanol over two different catalysts of Lewis acidic Zr-Beta and Brønsted acidic Al-MFI-ns at 120 °C for 48 h [50]. Likewise, Hf-MOF combined with Al-Beta could catalyze cascade conversion of furfural to GVL with 51% yield in 6 h at 140 °C [53]. Although good results were obtained with those combination catalyst systems, the sequential addition of catalysts caused them to be difficultly separated and reused. Thus, a single bifunctional catalyst with Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites for one-pot one-step cascade conversion of furfural to GVL should be more preferable. Mesoporous silicas are a captivating kind of materials that have a wide range of applications in catalysis due to their outstanding properties, including low-cost, facile preparative procedure, large surface area, high thermal/mechanical stability, well-defined pore channels, tunable physical/chemical property and easy functionalization [54]. Compared to common SBA-15 with a one-dimensional array of pores, KIT-5 is three-dimensional mesoporous silicate possessing interconnected pores, which permits better mass diffusion and thereby offers more available active-sites for reactions [55]. In this work, we reported the incorporation of Zr into KIT-5 with the intention of preparing a series of bifunctional Zr-KIT-5 catalysts with Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites, and then employed them for hydrogenation-cyclization of levulinates to GVL via CTH process. 2-Propanol was selected as H-donor and solvent for the tandem reactions due to its superior hydrogen transfer capability to other common alcohols [45]. The as-prepared Zr-KIT-5(10) material exhibited remarkable catalytic activity, furnishing 93.8% ethyl levulinate conversion with 91.4% GVL selectivity at 180 °C for 6 h. In addition, a minor decline in GVL yield (∼7.7%) was observed in the sixth run compared to original activity, implying that Zr-KIT-5(10) catalyst was stable in the tested catalytic system. Furthermore, the bifunctional Zr-KIT-5 catalysts with Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites were examined to be capable of catalyzing the tandem conversion of furfural to GVL in a single pot, including hydrogenation, ring-opening, and hydrogenation-cyclization reactions. A promising result (40.1% yield of GVL) was obtained over the Zr-KIT-5(10) catalyst at 180 °C for 6 h."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Zirconium(IV) oxychloride (ZrOCl2·8H2O, 98%), ethyl levulinate (EL, 99%), methyl levulinate (ML, >99%), butyl levulinate (BL, 98%), levulinic acid (LA, 99%), furfural (FF, 99%) and γ-valerolactone (GVL, 98%) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Industrial Inc. n-Propyl levulinate was provided by Sigma-Aldrich. Isopropyl levulinate was synthesized by ourselves (∼97% purity, the corresponding 1H NMR spectrum was provided in Fig. S1 in supporting information). Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 99%) was bought from Beijing InnoChem Science & Technology Co., Ltd. Pluronic F68 (Maverage = 8350) was provided by Maya Reagent Co. Ltd. Hydrochloric acid (36–38 wt%), 2-propanol, and all other reagents with analytical grade were procured from Chongqing Chuandong Chemical Reagent Company."
3,Synthesis of Zr-containing mesoporous silicates,"2.2 Synthesis of Zr-containing mesoporous silicates A series of Zr-KIT-5 catalysts with different Si/Zr molar ratios were prepared as following procedure. Briefly, a transparent solution was attained by dissolving 0.9 g Pluronic F68 into 0.4 mol/L hydrochloric acid solution (45 mL) with magnetic stirring (500 rpm) at 45 °C. Then, 4.2 g (20 mmol) of TEOS was added into the above solution followed by addition of the required amount (0.5, 0.8, 2 and 4 mmol) of ZrOCl2·8H2O. Afterward, the mixture solution was continued to stir (500 rpm) for 24 h, which was subsequently transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and treated at 100 °C for another 24 h. The white solid products were collected through filtration and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. Finally, the Zr-KIT-5 catalysts were achieved after calcination at 450 °C for 6 h in the static air. And the catalysts are denoted as Zr-KIT-5(x), where x is designed as the molar ratio of Si to Zr. For comparison, Si-KIT-5 was synthesized based on the above synthetic procedure without adding ZrOCl2·8H2O during the preparation process."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (2θ = 5–80°) of samples were recorded on a D/max-TTR III X-ray powder diffractometer. Conventional N2-physisorptions of samples were performed at −196 °C on a Micromeritics ASAP 2460 instrument to determine BET surface area, pore size distribution and pore volume, wherein samples were degassed at 200 °C for 8 h prior to the measurements. The thermal stability (0–800 °C) of material was determined with a NETZSCHSTA 429 apparatus in a flowing air (10 mL/min). The concentrations of Si and Zr elements in the as-prepared catalysts and the concentration of Zr in reaction filtrate after removing catalyst were determined by means of using a TJA Advantage ICP-AES apparatus. FT-IR (Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy) spectra of the as-prepared samples were acquired on a NICOLET iS50 (ThermoFisher Scientific) instrument armed with an iS50 ATR (Attenuated total reflectance) diamond crystal. Solid-state 29Si NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker Avance III (Ascend 500 HD) spectrometer equipped with a MAS (magic angle spinning) probe. NH3-TPD (Temperature Programmed Desorption) measurements were fulfilled with an AutoChem 2920 chemisorption instrument equipped with a TCD (Thermal Conductivity Detector) to determine the acid amounts of samples. The samples were firstly heated at 300 °C for 1 h in He flow (30 mL/min), then subjected to a mixture gases of NH3/He (1/10, volume ratio) with a flow rate of 20 mL/min at 50 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the physically adsorbed NH3 were removed via purging a pure He flow (30 mL/min) at 50 °C for 3 h. Desorption of NH3 was finally proceeded through heating the samples from 50 to 700 °C. FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorption to samples were recorded on a NICOLET iS50 (ThermoFisher Scientific) FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a vacuum system to evaluate acid properties. The pyridine adsorption to samples proceeded after heating the samples to 200 °C for 2 h under vacuum (10−2 Pa). Then the samples containing chemisorbed pyridine were evacuated at 200 °C for 30 min before recording the FT-IR spectra. TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy) image and HAADF-STEM (High-angle annular Dark-field Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy) images were achieved on a JEM-1200EX instrument. DRIFTS (Diffuse Reflection Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy) experiments of representative samples (i.e., EL/Zr-KIT-5(10) and EL/ZrO2) to study the interplay of catalyst and EL were performed on a NICOLET iS50 (ThermoFisher Scientific) FT-IR spectrometer armed with MCT (Mercury Cadmium Telluride) detector. The samples of EL/Zr-KIT-5(10) and EL/ZrO2 were prepared by the following procedure: 0.1 g Zr-KIT-5(10) or ZrO2 was impregnated in 2 mL 2-propanol containing 1 mmol EL, stirred (500 rpm) at room temperature for 10 min, dried at 60 °C under vacuum, and finally subjected to DRIFTS measurements. 1H NMR spectrum was acquired on an AVANCE III HD 400 MHz spectrometer."
5,Catalytic tests,"2.4 Catalytic tests Hydrogenation-cyclization of EL to GVL: Catalytic transfer hydrogenation reactions were carried out in a 25 mL stainless steel autoclave containing Teflon-lined reactor with magnetic stirring (500 rpm). Briefly, a mixture of EL (1 mmol, 0.144 g), requisite catalyst amount, 2-propanol (5 mL) and naphthalene (0.02 g, internal standard) were charged into the reactor. The autoclave after sealing was dipped into a preheated oil bath preheated to the required temperature, whilst this point was taken as zero time of the reaction. After the reaction, the resulting solutions were filtered via a PTFE membrane (0.22 μm) with the help of a syringe and analyzed by GC (Agilent 7890B) and GC-MS (Agilent 6890–5973). The reaction procedure for hydrogenation-cyclization of other substrates, such as levulinic acid (LA), methyl levulinate (ML), n-propyl levulinate (PL), isopropyl levulinate (IPL) and butyl levulinate (BL), to GVL was similar with the above-described procedure. All experiments were repeatedly performed for 2–3 times, and average values with error bars (standard deviation: 0.6–5.4%) were reported. The liquid chemicals in reaction mixture were identified by GC-MS equipped with HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm), while yields of product/by-product and substrate conversions were determined by analysis of GC (FID detector) with HP-5 column (30 m × 0.320 mm × 0.25 μm) and calculated on the basis of standard curve of commercial samples. Filtration experiment of EL-to-GVL conversion over Zr-KIT-5(10): the solid catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture via filtration after the reaction proceeding for 1 h at 180 °C, the filtrate was subsequently allowed to stir for another 1–7 h under the identical reaction conditions. Reusability studies of Zr-KIT-5(10) in EL-to-GVL conversion: tests about five consecutive experiments over the spent catalyst were conducted, where the spent catalyst after each run was separated from the reaction mixture via centrifugation, washed two times (2 × 5 mL) with ethanol and dried at 80 °C overnight. Direct conversion of furfural to GVL: a mixture containing furfural (1 mmol, 0.096 g), catalyst (0.1 g), 2-propanol (5 mL) and naphthalene (0.02 g, internal standard) was charged into a 25 mL stainless steel autoclave with the Teflon-lined reactor. The reaction proceeded when the autoclave was dipped in a preheated oil bath. The liquid chemicals in the reaction mixture were analyzed by virtue of GC and GC-MS."
6,Results and discussions,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The complete removal of the template was exemplified by no obvious weight loss except eliminating physically absorbed water (<200 °C) in the TGA curve of Zr-KIT-5(10) sample (Fig. S2). Characteristic peaks of zirconium oxide were not observed in XRD patterns of as-prepared KIT-5 samples as compared to pure ZrO2 (prepared by precipitation method and calcined at 450 °C), implying the absence of zirconium oxide crystalline particles or too small particle size and zirconium oxide content to detect in the as-prepared Zr-KIT-5 samples (Fig. 1 a). Meanwhile, a wide band was observed for Si-KIT-5 and Zr-KIT-5 with different Si/Zr ratios of 5–40, which was attributed to the amorphous nature of as-prepared KIT-5 samples (Fig. 1a). The molar ratio of Si to Zr in the as-prepared Zr-KIT-5 samples was validated to be almost equal to the controlled ratio of Si/Zr in the preparation mixture (Table 1 ), suggesting nearly all of Zr ions in the synthetic mixture were introduced into the KIT-5 framework. In addition, one more band at 965.8 cm−1, characteristic of the stretching vibrations of Si–O–Zr bond [41], was clearly observed in the FT-IR spectra of Zr-KIT-5(40) and Zr-KIT-5(10) relative to Si-KIT-5, supporting that Zr has been incorporated into silica framework (Fig. 1b). Other typical bands including a band at 1056.6 cm−1 attributed to Si–O–Si asymmetric stretching vibration, a band at 798.6 cm−1 ascribed to Si–O–Si symmetric stretching vibration and a band at 1642.4 cm−1 belonged to Si–O–H blending vibration were also observed in the as-prepared samples. Furthermore, 29Si MAS NMR was employed to further confirm the incorporation of Zr into the silica framework and the results are presented in Fig. 1c. Three signals centered at about −91.7, −106.1 and −110.6 ppm were detected for Si-KIT-5 sample, which was ascribed to Q2 (i.e., Si(OSi)2(OH)2), Q3 (i.e., Si(OSi)3(OH) and Q4 (i.e., Si(OSi)4) species [56], respectively. The Q2 (∼−93.2 ppm, Si(OSi)2(OM)2), Q3 (∼−107.1 ppm, Si(OSi)3(OM)) and Q4 (∼−114.1 ppm, Si(OSi)4) species (M = Zr or H) with a slight chemical shift were also observed for Zr-KIT-5(10) sample, while the areas of Q2 and Q3 signal peak were evidently increased due to the incorporation of Zr compared to Si-KIT-5 sample, affording further evidence for the incorporation of Zr into silica framework [56]. A type IV isotherm along with an H2-type hysteresis loop located in the range of 0.4–0.8 P/P0 (relative pressure) was observed for all N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of as-prepared KIT-5 samples (Fig. 1d), which was indicative of typical mesoporous materials. And the delayed desorption was caused by existing small pore window in as-prepared KIT-5 samples, attesting to the presence of homogeneous cage-type pores [57]. Majority of the pore sizes centered in the range of 2.0–5.0 nm was observed for all as-prepared KIT-5 samples (Fig. 1e). Moreover, with the increase of Zr content, the BET surface areas monotonically decreased from 1150.9 m2/g for Si-KIT-5 to 580.9 m2/g for Zr-KIT-5(5), and the total pore volume decreased from 0.72 to 0.48 cm3/g correspondingly (Table 1). The increased incorporation of Zr or the generation of small ZrO2 clusters within the mesoporous channels of KIT-5 might result in the increase of its pore wall thickness, while concurrently decreased its BET surface area and pore volume [55,58]. In addition, the microporosity of as-prepared KIT-5 samples, namely the ratio of micropore volume to total volume, was also evaluated. As displayed in Table 1, the degree of microporosity of KIT-5 materials gradually decreased with the increase of Zr content, revealing that the micropores were gradually blocked by the increased introduction of Zr. In addition, the mesoporous structure was further verified by a representative high-resolution TEM image of Zr-KIT-5(10) catalyst (Fig. S3), wherein uniform pores with the diameter of about 2.5 nm were highly dispersed on the catalyst surface, which was in well accordance with the results obtained from N2 adsorption-desorption analysis with BJH method (Fig. 1e & Table 1). The amorphous nature of Zr-KIT-5(10) was also further confirmed because no crystal plane was observed in the high-resolution TEM image (Fig. S3), perfectly agreeing with the results from XRD analysis. Besides, the results of elemental mappings in Fig. 1f and g clearly showed that Zr- and Si-species were homogeneous distribution within the as-prepared Zr-KIT-5(10) samples. The acid amounts of as-prepared KIT-5 samples were determined by NH3-TPD studies (Fig. 2 a–e), and corresponding detail data were presented in Table 1. In the case of Si-KIT-5 sample, only a small amount of acid sites (0.27 mmol/g) was present (entry 1, Table 1). As expected, the acid amount of as-prepared Zr-KIT-5 samples was substantially enhanced after incorporation of Zr (Fig. 2b–e). And the enhancive acid amount derived from the increase of the content of Zr4+, showing Lewis acidity and the generation of Brønsted acid created by substituting Si4+ by Zr4+ in the silica framework [41]. Specifically, the acid amount firstly increased progressively from 1.59 mmol/g for Zr-KIT-5(40) to a maximum value of 1.86 mmol/g for Zr-KIT-5(10), and then decreased to 1.78 mmol/g with the further increase of Zr corporation (i.e., Zr-KIT-5(5) sample). The decrease in the acid amount of Zr-KIT-5(5) may be attributed to the decreased surface area and/or the generation of smaller zirconium oxide clusters with less acidity caused by incorporation of too much Zr content (i.e., Si/Zr = 5). Notably, majority of ammonia desorption peaks were located within a range of 50–350 °C (Fig. 2a–e), indicating that the acid sites of all Zr-KIT-5 samples were primarily assigned to weak acid sites [55], while a small number of moderate acid sites were observed for Zr-KIT-5(40), Zr-KIT-5(25) and Zr-KIT-5(10) samples. The properties of acid sites in as-prepared Zr-KIT-5 samples were evaluated by FT-IR of pyridine adsorption and the results were presented in Fig. 2f. A strong signal at around 1447.2 cm−1, characteristic of Lewis acidic sites [59], was observed at the FT-IR spectra of all Zr-based KIT-5 samples, implying that most of the acid sites in all Zr-KIT-5 samples were ascribed to Lewis acidic sites. Meanwhile, a weak absorbance band at approximately 1545.3 cm−1 corresponding to Brønsted acidic sites was also discovered in Fig. 2f, suggesting the presence of a handful of Brønsted acidic sites in as-prepared Zr-KIT-5 samples. A band at 1490.4 cm−1 corresponding to a combination of Lewis and Brønsted acidic sites was clearly observed, which further confirmed Brønsted-Lewis dual acidic nature of as-prepared Zr-KIT-5 samples. Additionally, the molar ratio of Lewis to Brønsted acid sites increased with the increase of Zr content (Table 1), which was possibly attributed to the increased rate of Lewis acid to Brønsted acid sites with the increase of Zr content."
8,Activity evaluation of different catalysts,"3.2 Activity evaluation of different catalysts The reactivity of different as-prepared catalysts for CTH of EL to GVL with 2-propanol as H-donor was initially compared at 180 °C for 4 h, and the results are depicted in Fig. 3 a. An EL conversion of 2.1% and a GVL selectivity of zero were obtained from a blank experiment without a catalyst, demonstrating that the catalyst was necessary for GVL formation. And only 3.1% EL conversion along with 17.9% GVL selectivity was obtained in the presence of Si-KIT-5 catalyst. However, EL conversion and GVL selectivity were substantially boosted over Zr-containing KIT-5 catalysts as evidenced from Fig. 3a, together with the GVL selectivity increased with the increase of ratio of Lewis to Brønsted acid sites from Zr-KIT-5(40) to Zr-KIT-5(5) catalyst, clearly unveiling the critical role of Zr in the CTH of EL to GVL, whilst suggesting that Lewis acidic sites were crucial for the reaction. On the other hand, the degree of microporosity of the used KIT-5 catalysts slightly declined as compared with that of the fresh catalysts (Table S1), which was probably resulted from adsorbing part of organic compounds within the catalyst pores. In addition, the adsorption of organic compounds within the catalyst was further corroborated by the larger weight loss of the used catalyst (21.0%) than that of the fresh catalyst (18.4%), as shown in Fig. S2. Therefore, the decreased pore volume and microporosity from Zr-KIT-5(40) to Zr-KIT-5(10) catalyst possibly also contributed to the increase of GVL yield with decreasing the catalyst adsorption of organic compounds. In particular, the superior performance of as-prepared Zr-KIT-5 catalysts was obtained for Zr-KIT-5(10), which afforded 90.8% EL conversion and 90.6% GVL selectivity accompanied by 4.9% yield of isopropyl levulinate (IPL). The superior performance of Zr-KIT-5(10) benefited from its largest amount of total acid amount (1.86 mmol/g), which could be corroborated by GVL formation rate and TOF value monotonously increased with the increase of acid amount as shown in Fig. 3b. Of particular note was that IPL with the yield varying in the range of 4.9–6.8% was detected under the tested conditions, which was originated from transesterification of EL with 2-propanol over acid sites. Further increasing the incorporation of Zr content (i.e., Zr-KIT-5(5) sample) resulted in a slight increase in GVL selectivity (i.e., 92.9%) due to possessing highest ratio of Lewis to Brønsted acid sites (i.e., L/B = 6.8), while a distinct drop in EL conversion (i.e., 82.7%) was observed, possibly resulting from its lower surface area (580.9 m2/g) and decreased acid amount (1.78 mmol/g) relative to Zr-KIT-5(10). In addition, comparison of catalytic performance between Zr-KIT-5(10) and ZrO2 in the CTH of EL to GVL using 2-propanol as H-donor was explored (Table S2). Both EL conversion and GVL formation rate obtained in the presence of Zr-KIT-5(10) catalyst surpassed that of bulk zirconium oxide, which probably benefited from the good active-sites accessibility of Zr-KIT-5(10) originated from intrinsic cage-type pores within KIT-5 material (Table S2). To get insight into the superior catalytic performance of Zr-KIT-5(10) catalyst, DRIFTS experiments were performed to study the interplay of catalyst and EL (Fig. 4 ). The characteristic bands regarding ketone carbonyl and ester carbonyl of EL were observed in DRIFTS spectra of both EL/Zr-KIT-5(10) and EL/ZrO2 samples, by referring to that of EL (Fig. 4). No shift was observed for the vibration band of ester carbonyl in all DRIFTS spectra. However, a slight shift was observed for the vibration band of ketone carbonyl in the DRIFTS spectrum of EL/Zr-KIT-5(10) relative to EL and EL/ZrO2, which probably resulted from the high adsorption effect of Zr-KIT-5(10) catalyst on the ketone carbonyl group of EL. And the adsorption effect may have a positive role in the increase of contact probability between active sites and EL. Thus, the large amount of acid sites (1.86 mmol/g), facile active-sites accessibility derived from intrinsic cage-type pores within KIT-5 material, suitable pore volume along with microporosity and/or enhanced adsorption effect on the ketone carbonyl group of EL, as well as relatively large surface area (646.3 m2/g) are possibly the causes for the outstanding performance of Zr-KIT-5(10) in CTH of EL to GVL."
9,CTH of EL to GVL with Zr-KIT-5(10),"3.3 CTH of EL to GVL with Zr-KIT-5(10) As presented in Fig. 5 a, the catalytic performance of Zr-KIT-5(10) for EL-to-GVL conversion in 2-propanol was strongly dependant on the reaction temperature. EL conversion and GVL yield monotonously increased from 34.8% and 27.3% at 140 °C to 94.5% and 85.1% at 200 °C, respectively. While GVL selectivity firstly increased with the increase of temperature and reached 90.6% at 180 °C, then stabled at around 90.0% even elevating the temperature to 200 °C. Noteworthy, the GVL yield was as high as 82.2% at 180 °C after 4 h, which was only slightly lower compared to the GVL yield (85.1%) obtained at 200 °C after 4 h, indicating that the reaction temperature did not play a profound effect on GVL yield as the reaction temperature was beyond 180 °C. The less promotional effect of a higher reaction temperature (i.e., 200 °C) on GVL yield (increased by only 2.9% relative to 180 °C) is possibly attributed to the reversible reduction process, approaching to the reaction equilibrium. The formation of IPL under the tested system seemed to be independent on the reaction temperature, and the yield of IPL was in the range of 3.7–5.7% at different temperatures (Fig. 5a). Comprehensive consideration of catalytic performance and economical viewpoint, 180 °C was then preferred for the next investigations. The results in Fig. 5b exhibited that reaction time was significantly influential on the generation of GVL. With prolonging reaction time from 1 to 6 h, GVL yield elevated from 42.2% to 85.7% whilst GVL selectivity maintained at ∼90.0%. However, further extending reaction time to 8 h, GVL yield together with GVL selectivity decreased slightly, implying too long reaction time (>6 h) was not conducive to GVL formation. Simultaneously, about 5.0% yield of IPL was detected within 1–6 h and gradually decreased to 3.8% with a reaction time of 8 h, suggesting a handful of IPL always existed in reaction mixture throughout the studies. Besides, the influence of catalyst loadings on GVL formation was also examined. The results presented in Fig. 5c clearly showed that the increase of catalyst amount contributed to elevating EL conversion and GVL yield concurrently due to more available active sites, and the proper catalyst loading was 0.1 g as only marginal increase (∼0.5%) in GVL yield was achieved further increase catalyst loading (i.e., 0.15 g). Evidence from the results of filtration experiment depicted in Fig. 5d demonstrated that the reaction was terminated after removal of the catalyst, indicating the heterogeneous nature of Zr-KIT-5(10) catalyst during the course of the reaction. In the meantime, only <1 ppm of Zr in the filtrate was detected by ICP-AES measurement, further supporting the heterogeneous nature of Zr-KIT-5(10) catalyst."
10,Catalyst reusability,"3.4 Catalyst reusability Consecutive six repeated experiments over the catalyst were performed to examine the reusability of Zr-KIT-5(10) material in the CTH of EL to GVL with 2-propanol as H-donor (Fig. 6 ), where it was observed that Zr-KIT-5(10) could keep relative constant activity throughout the six successive runs, just with GVL yield decreased by 7.7% in the sixth run compared to fresh catalyst. In addition, minor changes in physicochemical properties of fresh and spent Zr-KIT-5(10) catalysts were observed as evidenced from XRD (Fig. S4), N2-physisorption (Fig. S5) and NH3-TPD analysis (Fig. S6). The concentration of leached Zr ion was found to be below 1 ppm (ICP-AES analysis), further confirming that the Zr-KIT-5(10) catalyst was capable of being reutilized."
11,Substrate scope,"3.5 Substrate scope Based on its satisfactory catalytic performance for the production of GVL from EL using 2-propanol as H-donor, Zr-KIT-5(10) catalyst was further examined for the synthesis of GVL from levulinic acid and other usual alkyl levulinates, and the main results were illustrated in Table 2 . The strategy was highly applicable for CTH of levulinic acid and methyl levulinate, furnishing 88.6% and 87.2% yield of GVL at 180 °C for 6 h (entries 1–2, Table 2), respectively. Nevertheless, the method encountered activity decline just giving 65.3% yield of GVL when n-propyl levulinate was used as substrate under the identical reaction conditions (entry 4, Table 2). The lower conversion of n-propyl levulinate relative to EL was probably owing to the steric effect of long-chain alkyl [45]. Luckily, the conversion of long-chain alkyl levulinates, such as n-propyl levulinate, isopropyl levulinate and butyl levulinate (entries 5–7, Table 2), could be elevated by virtue of extending reaction time (i.e., 10 h), leading to 80.2%, 76.1% and 77.3% GVL yield, respectively. Therefore, the strategy has a good level of generality for the CTH of bio-based levulinates in 2-propanol."
12,One-pot conversion of FF to GVL,"3.6 One-pot conversion of FF to GVL Inspired by good performance exhibiting in the CTH of EL to GVL, in combination of Zr-KIT-5 catalysts simultaneously possessing Brønsted-Lewis dual acidic sites which are imperative for the conversion of furfural into GVL with alcohol as H-donor [50], thus direct conversion of furfural into GVL over Zr-KIT-5 catalysts in 2-propanol in a single pot were carefully examined, where cascade reactions including transfer hydrogenation, ring-opening reaction, secondary transfer hydrogenation, and cyclization reaction were involved (Scheme 1). The results obtained from one-pot conversion of furfural to GVL over as-prepared different Zr-KIT-5 samples are compiled in Fig. 7 a. Exhilaratingly, GVL could be obtained from furfural over different samples at 180 °C for 6 h and IPL was concomitantly generated. It was found that GVL yield increased with the increase of Zr incorporation while IPL yield decreased with the increase of Zr incorporation. The trends are in agreement with the hydrogenation capacity enhancing with the increase of Zr incorporation. A 40.1% yield of GVL with 21.2% IPL yield was obtained over Zr-KIT-5(10) catalyst, and the total yield of GVL and IPL was superior to other catalysts. In-depth investigation of furfural-to-GVL was thereby performed using Zr-KIT-5(10) as a catalyst. The reaction of furfural-to-GVL was also greatly influenced by reaction temperature and reaction time (Fig. 7b–d). The GVL yield gradually increased with prolonging reaction time from 2 to 10 h at the temperature of 160 °C, while the IPL yield presented a trend of initially increase and then decrease, which could be elucidated as the IPL was an intermediate of GVL formation from furfural. Besides, the overall yield of GVL and IPL progressively increased with extending reaction time and reached 48.3% (30.7% GVL yield & 17.6% IPL yield) at 10 h. As shown in GC spectra of the reaction mixture obtained at 160 °C within variable times (Fig. 8 a), several intermediates, identified by GC-MS (Fig. S7), were formed in the early reaction period of 2 h. The most dominant intermediate was found to be 2-(isopropoxymethyl)furan, which was initially derived from the etherification of furfuryl alcohol with 2-propanol, and then gradually converted to GVL or other chemicals. This could result in the progressive increase of GVL yield by prolonging the reaction time. When the temperature was elevated to 180 °C (Fig. 7c), the variation trend of IPL yield was similar to that variation trend observed at 160 °C. While GVL yield firstly increased with prolonging reaction time and reached to the maximum value (40.1%) at 6 h, then decreased slightly with further extending reaction time. Meanwhile, the maximum value of the total yield of GVL and IPL was 61.3% (t = 6 h). Further increase of temperature (i.e., 200 °C) could marginally increase GVL yield to 40.8% at 6 h, and the corresponding total yield of GVL and IPL was 54.5%. The GC spectra in Fig. 8b exhibited that fewer by-products or intermediates were detected at relatively high temperature (i.e., 180 and 200 °C) compared to those at 160 °C, which could explain the total yields of GVL and IPL at relatively high temperature (i.e., 180 and 200 °C) were higher than that at 160 °C. It is also noticed that the formed intermediates are more prone to contributing to the formation of humins at the relatively lower reaction temperature (i.e., 160 °C). In comprehensive consideration of activity and economic viewpoint, 180 °C and 6 h (the autogenous pressure of the reaction system at 180 °C was found to be 1.5 MPa) are the preferred reaction temperature and reaction time for one-pot conversion of furfural to GVL with Zr-KIT-5(10) catalyst, respectively."
13,Conclusions,"A series of dual acidic Zr-KIT-5 catalysts with Brønsted and Lewis acid sites have been successfully prepared and developed for catalyzing the transfer hydrogenation-cyclization of biomass-based EL to GVL with 2-propanol as H-donor and solvent. A remarkable catalytic performance was observed for Zr-KIT-5(10) catalyst, where optimum results pointed to 93.8% EL conversion with 91.4% GVL selectivity at 180 °C with a reaction of 6 h. The large amount of acid sites (1.86 mmol/g) and surface area (646.3 m2/g), coupled with facile active-sites accessibility derived from intrinsic cage-type pores within KIT-5 material, suitable pore volume and microporosity, and/or adsorption effect for ketone carbonyl of EL, were responsible for the outstanding performance of Zr-KIT-5(10) in the CTH of EL to GVL. The catalytic behavior of Zr-KIT-5(10) has been examined to be heterogeneous catalysis via filtration experiments and ICP measurement. Moreover, the results of consecutive reuse of Zr-KIT-5(10) demonstrated that only 7.7% decline in GVL yield at the sixth run compared to fresh catalyst. In addition, the catalytic system comprised of Zr-KIT-5(10) as catalyst and 2-propanol as H-donor is applicable for GVL synthesis from levulinic acid and its esters, affording satisfactory GVL yields (76.1–88.6%). Furthermore, Zr-KIT-5(10) material exhibited a promising catalytic performance in the direct conversion of biomass-based furfural to GVL in a single pot using 2-propanol as both H-donor and solvent, providing 40.1% yield of GVL and 21.2% yield of IPL at 180 °C for 6 h. The present work is expected to expand the application field of mesoporous silicon-based heterogeneous catalysts and provide more reference for biomass conversion."
