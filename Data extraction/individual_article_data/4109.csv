0,Introduction,"Development of environmentally friendly energy technologies is an effective strategy to mitigate the energy and environmental issues caused by the consumption of fossil fuels, our primary source of energy so far [1-3]. Of these, fuel cells represent a viable option where chemical energy is efficiently converted into electrical energy with minimal impacts on the environment [4-6]. Among the many types of fuel cells [7-10], direct alcohol fuel cell (DAFC) has been hailed as a promising clean energy technology, where alcohols (e.g., methanol and ethanol) are used as the chemical fuels. Alcohols are in general low-cost, contain a high energy density, and are available from a wide range of (sustainable) sources and safe and convenient in storage and transportation [11-17]. Yet, critical challenges remain. For instance, for direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC), there remain two major issues that limit the performance, the slow electron-transfer kinetics of anodic methanol oxidation and methanol crossover. The former dictates the rate of proton production and hence the efficiency of power generation, whereas the latter is related to the catharsis ability of the electrolyte. For DAFCs based on more complex alcohols, the overall performance is generally limited due to the lack of efficient catalysts for the cleavage of the C − C bonds and complete oxidation of the alcohols to CO2 [18-20]. Thus far, platinum-based nanoparticles remain the leading catalysts for alcohol electrooxidation [21-23]. However, the low stability, easy CO poisoning and high cost of Pt have severely hampered the practical applications of DAFC [20,24,25]. Therefore, in recent decades, a wide range of strategies have been employed to improve the electrocatalytic performance of platinum towards alcohol oxidation reaction (AOR) and reduce the operational cost of DAFC [26-28], for instance, by alloying with other (non)noble metals, formation of nanocomposites with carbon derivatives, transition metal oxides/hydroxides, and transition metal carbides [19,29-33], and manipulation of the nanostructure morphologies [34-36]. Alternatively, development of platinum-free AOR catalysts represents another effective strategy. Among these, one-dimensional (1D) electrocatalysts with a highly anisotropic structure are found to facilitate electron transfer, high exposure of active lattice planes, and strong durability during long-term electrocatalytic operation, in comparison with the bulk and nanoparticle counterparts [34,37-39]. Three-dimensional (3D) assemblies of low-dimensional nanostructures are another class of AOR electrocatalysts, which usually exhibit the combined properties of the structural components, an open and porous structure, a large surface area, good chemical and mechanical strength, resistance to aggregation, and high flexibility [40-42]. In fact, 3D AOR electrocatalysts usually have the merits of a high utilization ratio of the active catalysts, abundant active sites, accelerated mass/electron transfer kinetics, and high AOR activity and durability [43,44]. More recently, AOR electrocatalysts based on two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures have also been attracting a great deal of attention. A range of 2D nanostructures have indeed been examined rather extensively in recent studies, such as noble metals and alloys, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), transition-metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes), layered double hydroxides (LDHs), etc., because of their large surface area, shortened charge migration distance, and abundant diffusion channels for ions and molecules [14-17,45]. Notably, the 2D nanostructures can also effectively relieve the stress caused by the volume change and impact damage of bubbles generated by reactions on the material structure, leading to satisfactory electrocatalytic activity and stability. A series of efficient strategies have been reported for the structural engineering of 2D noble metal-based electrocatalysts, such as the precise control of their morphology, thickness, size, porosity, defect, doping, crystal phase, and preferential growth of highly active lattice planes. Such efforts can be aided by theoretical/computational breakthroughs for high-throughput material screening. Thus, in this review, we will summarize recent research progress of 2D functional nanomaterials as effective electrocatalysts for AOR based on noble metals and alloys, metal oxides/hydroxides, metal carbides, and metal-based composites, within the context of reaction mechanism, performance evaluation and correlation of electrocatalytic activity with material structure. We conclude the review with a perspective highlighting the promises and challenges in future research of 2D functional nanomaterials for AOR electrocatalysis."
1,Noble metals and alloys,"Up to now, noble metals and alloys remain the catalysts of choice towards AOR [18]. Electrocatalysts based on 2D nanostructures of noble metals are of particular interest [46], and alloying with another metal is a commonly employed strategy to improve the performance and concurrently to reduce the cost [47]. For instance, Ru is often selected as the second metal to alloy Pt, due to the strong activity in water dissociation at low potentials, and the electronic effect that facilitates the removal of poisoning intermediates [48]. The complete oxidation of methanol to CO2 entails the release of 6 electrons and the transfer of 6 OH−. As the procedures and mechanisms of methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) are widely known (Fig. 1 ), only the simplified multi-step reactions on a Pt surface in acid media are listed below [49-52], (1) Pt + CH3OH → Pt−COads + 4H++4e− where methanol is firstly adsorbed on the Pt surface, and dehydrogenation leads to the formation of Pt3−COH as the main intermediate; meanwhile oxidation of the produced Pt−H species to protons is a facile step. Note that the platinum surface is prone to CO poisoning in the absence of active oxygen species (reaction 1). To minimize this poisoning effect, alcohol is best oxidized when a large amount of oxygen-containing species is adsorbed on the electrode surface. This can be facilitated by the incorporation of a second metal (M = Cu, Ni, Ru, Sn, etc) [48,53-55], (2) M + H2O → M−OHads + H++e− where the generation of surface OH species boosts the further oxidation of CO to CO2, as manifested in the following reaction, (3) Pt−COads + M−OHads → CO2 + Pt + M + H++e− with the total reaction of methanol oxidation on the anode as (4) CH3OH + H2O → CO2 + 6H++6e− In alkaline media, methanol oxidation on Pt surfaces involves a different reaction pathway [52,57,58], (5) Pt + CH3OH + 3OH− → Pt−CHO + 3H2O + 3e− (6) M + OH− → M−OHads + e− (7) Pt−CHO + M−OHads + 2OH− → Pt + M + CO2 + 2H2O + 2e− Specifically, dehydrogenation of methanol leads to the formation of a series of carbon-containing reaction intermediates, which are then oxidized by oxygen-containing species to produce formate and carbon dioxide. It is generally believed that the oxidation of the CHOads intermediate to CO2 is the rate-limiting step (reaction 7). Thus, the rate of methanol oxidation can be enhanced by an increase of the solution pH as well as the incorporation of a second metal into the Pt catalysts, whereby further oxidation of CHOads is facilitated. The electrooxidation of more complicated alcohols, such as ethanol [10,11,24,59,60], ethylene glycol [52,61,62], and glycerol [63], involves similar reaction pathways, as it is energetically challenging to break the C−C bond. Understanding these reaction pathways provides a fundamental guideline for the efficient use of the fuels, where the selectivity is critical to obtain desired compounds."
2,Noble metals,"2.1 Noble metals 2D nanostructures of noble metals have emerged as high-performance electrocatalysts for the efficient oxidation of alcohols [46]. For instance, Slabon et al. synthesized 2D arrays of monodisperse Pd nanocrystals by the reduction of Pd(acac)2 with oleylamine (OAm) and borane tributylamine (BTB) at 90 °C for 1 h as efficient electrocatalysts towards both MOR and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) [64]. In transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements (Fig. 2 a), the spherical nanoparticles can be seen to exhibit an average diameter of 7.1 ± 1.1 nm. Electrochemical measurements in the alkaline solution containing 0.5 M NaOH and 1.0 M methanol or ethanol show that the peak current density reached 1040 A g−1 (6.7 mA cm−2) for MOR and 5500 A g−1 (35.7 mA cm−2) for EOR. This remarkable activity was ascribed to the formation of a 2D array that suppressed agglomeration of the nanoparticles and thus minimized the loss of the active surface area. In another study, 2D ultrathin Pd nanosheets were facilely prepared by one-pot reduction of Pd(acac)2 in formic acid with trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) at 30 °C for 24 h, and used for EOR electrocatalysis [65]. TEM study (Fig. 2b) clearly shows the formation of a planar nanostructure with some wrinkles and curls, which possesses a large specific surface area. X−ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (Fig. 2c) suggested that the formation of nanosheets was due to the preferential growth of the 〈111〉 planes with CO as the reducing agent; and voltammetric measurements showed a markedly enhanced electrochemical surface area of the Pd nanosheets (ECSA, 234 m2 g−1), as compared to that of commercial Pd black (68 m2 g−1). Notably, the electrocatalytic activity towards EOR was found to increase by about 1.8 folds, most likely due to the exposure of abundant surface atoms. In a separate study, Slabon and co-workers prepared 2D arrays of Au nanocrystals (8.0 ± 1.0 nm in diameter) by one-pot reduction of gold(III) acetate with OAm and 1,2-hexadecanediol at 30 °C for 24 h, and observed excellent electrocatalytic activity towards MOR and EOR [66]. The oxidation peak current density was found to be 49 and 74 μA cm−2 in 0.1 and 1.0 M KOH along with 1.0 M methanol, respectively. The corresponding mass activity in the 1.0 M KOH + 1.0 M ethanol solution was estimated to be 830 A g−1. Song et al. prepared 2D circular Pt nanodendrites with a mean size of 138.8 ± 25.3 nm and thickness of 13.4 ± 4.7 nm (Fig. 2d) by chemical reduction of platinum complexes with ascorbic acid in the presence of a P123 block copolymer and preformed seeds, which exhibited a much larger ECSA of 43.4 ± 0.2 m2 g−1 than commercial Pt black (23.5 ± 1.4 m2 g−1), and the peak current density towards MOR was 1.4 times that of Pt black [67]. In recent studies, Chen and coworkers also observed apparent electrocatalytic activities of 2D nanostructures of Rh towards MOR [68-73]. Experimentally, ultrathin 2D hierarchical porous Rh nanosheets were prepared by a facile hydrothermal method mediated by 1-hydroxyethylidene and 1,1-diphosphonic acid (HEDP) [68]. Owing to the coordination interaction between HEDP and Rh3+ and the water solubility of HEDP, the as-prepared Rh nanosheets exhibited an ultralow thickness of about 1.7 nm, abundant pores/edge atoms (Fig. 2e), and grain boundary atoms. These unique structural characteristics facilitated electron transport, mass transfer, and accessibility of active sites for MOR. Indeed, in comparison to commercial Rh black, the porous Rh nanosheets possessed a larger ECSA (73.13 m2 g−1 vs. 42.04 m2 g−1), a smaller charge transfer resistance (RCT, 10 Ω vs. 20 Ω), and a higher specific activity (333 A g Rh - 1 vs. 99.5 A g Rh - 1 ) (Fig. 2f). Consistent results were obtained in theoretical calculations, which showed a larger methanol adsorption energy and lower energy barrier in MOR by the Rh nanosheets. In another study [69], Chen and coworkers prepared nanocomposites consisting of Rh nanosheets and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) as effective electrocatalysts for MOR. In the synthetic process, polyethylenimine (PEI, M w = 600) was used as the stabilizing and facet-selective agent to facilitate the growth of sheet-like nanostructures, due to the strong adsorption of amine groups onto the Rh(111) facets (Fig. 2g). The thickness of the Rh nanosheet-RGO nanocomposites was estimated to be ca. 3 nm by AFM measurements, where the RGO facilitated the formation and stabilization of the Rh nanosheets. In electrochemical measurements, the Rh nanosheet-RGO nanocomposites were found to deliver a specific current density of 264 A g Rh - 1 , as compared to only 171 A g Rh - 1 for Rh nanoparticle-RGO and 73 A g Rh - 1 for Rh nanoparticles alone. This was ascribed to the markedly increased number of active sites in the 2D nanostructures, as compared to the nanoparticle form. The activity can be further enhanced by a precise control of the morphology and porosity of the ultrathin 2D nanosheets. Recently, Hong et al. fabricated 2D ultrathin Pd nanomeshes by oxidizing initially solid Pd nanosheets with air or pure O2, where the porosity can be controlled by adjusting the oxidative etching intensity and time (Fig. 2h) [74]. The obtained ultrathin mesoporous Pd nanomeshes exhibited an average thickness of about 3 nm and pore size of 11.4 nm. Thanks to the high fraction of exposed surface atoms and active sites, the Pd nanomeshes exhibited a large ECSA of 76.1 m2 g−1, and a high peak current density of 5400 A g Pd - 1 (7.09 mA cm−2), in comparison to the pristine Pd nanosheets (1490 A g Pd - 1 , 3.42 mA cm−2) and commercial Pd/C (670 A g Pd - 1 , 2.54 mA cm−2) (Fig. 2i). In these studies, one can see that 2D noble metal nanostructures display a superior electrocatalytic performance towards MOR/EOR, as compared to the bulk and nanoparticle counterparts, due to preferential exposure of select crystalline planes, rich active sites on the surface, large active area, shortened electron/ion migration path, and good structural stability."
3,Metal alloys,"2.2 Metal alloys As mentioned above, the performance of alcohol electrooxidation can be further enhanced by alloying noble metal catalysts with another oxyphilic metal (e.g., Ru for MOR and Sn for EOR). This is primarily to mitigate the issue of self-poisoning of the catalysts by the strongly adsorbed COads−like intermediates [48,75]. A third co-catalyst has also been added to deepen the oxidation of more complicated alcohols, such as W, Ni, Ir, and some rare-earth metals by taking advantage of their unique 4f electronic configurations to facilitate the cleavage of the C−C bond, leading to enhanced electrocatalytic activity and durability [75,76]. As shown in Fig. 3 a, Gao et al. prepared an ensemble of ultrathin 2D nanosheets of Pd−based binary alloys by a universal surfactant-free strategy and observed a high performance towards alcohol oxidation [77]. A series of Pd−M (M = Ag, Pb, Au, Ga, Cu, Pt, etc.) alloy nanosheets were facilely obtained with a similar tremella-like morphology (Fig. 3b). Among the samples, Pd7Ag nanosheets displayed the highest electrocatalytic activity of 2180 A g−1 (4.4 mA cm−2) for MOR, 7080 A g−1 (14.3 mA cm−2) for EOR, and 7010 A g−1 (14.1 mA cm−2) for ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) in a solution containing 0.5 M KOH and 1.0 M alcohol. In addition, the Pd7Ag nanosheets showed the lowest activity decay with a 66.8% loss after 3600 s at + 0.8 V vs. RHE and a 45.8% loss after 500 successive cycles. In another study [78], Guo et al. synthesized 2D hexagonal PtBi/Pt core–shell nanoplates by reducing Pd(acac)2 and Bi(OAc)3 with L-ascorbic acid and NH4Br in 1-octadecene and OAm at 160 °C for 5 h, and observed exceptional bifunctional electrocatalytic activity towards both ORR and MOR. The thickness of the nanoplates could be controlled by the reaction time, for instance, 9.5 nm at 30 min and 29.0 nm at 5 h (Fig. 3c). The electrocatalytic performance was then tested by cyclic voltammetric (CV) measurements in 0.1 M HClO4 + 0.1 M methanol. The PtBi/Pt core–shell nanoplates exhibited a high specific activity of 3.18 mA cm−2 and mass activity of 1100 A g−1, as compared to 0.430 mA cm−2 and 300 A g−1 for commercial Pt/C (Fig. 3d). The nanoplates also displayed markedly enhanced stability. This remarkable performance was ascribed to the core–shell structure composed of an intermetallic hcp PtBi core and an ultrathin fcc Pt shell, which also endowed high durability to the PtBi nanoplates. Separately, Du et al. fabricated 3D PdCu alloy nanoflowers consisting of ultrathin 2D nanosheets (Fig. 3e) by the reduction of Na2PdCl4, CuCl2·2H2O, and W(CO)6 in a mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and acetic acid at 150 °C for 3 h in an oil bath, which exhibited apparent electrocatalytic activity towards EGOR [79]. Among the series of alloys, the Pd2Cu nanoflowers delivered the highest mass activity of 4714.1 A g−1 for EGOR in 1 M KOH + 1 M ethylene glycol (Fig. 3f). In chronoamperometric (CA) test for 3600 s, the current density remained much higher than those of other PdCu alloys and commercial Pd/C. In a similar procedure, Jin and coworkers synthesized PdCuM (M = Ru, Rh, and Ir) ternary alloy nanosheets (Fig. 3g) by the reduction of Na2PdCl4, CuCl2·2H2O, and W(CO)6 in a mixture of DMF and acetic acid [80]. The thickness of the ultrathin nanosheets was estimated to be as low as 2.8 nm. CV tests in 1 M KOH showed that the ECSA values of Pd59Cu33Ru8, Pd58Cu29Ru13, Pd58Cu29Ru18, PdCu, and commercial Pd/C nanosheets were 35.3, 28.5, 31.2, 21.7, and 20.2 m2 g−1, respectively. Among these, Pd59Cu33Ru8 exhibited the highest mass specific activity of 1660 A g−1 (4.7 mA cm−2) in 1 M KOH + 1 M methanol (Fig. 3h), in comparison to 1180 A g−1 for Pd63Cu29Rh8 and 1550 A g−1 for Pd57Cu34Ir9. This was accounted for by the abundant channels for fast mass transport, and ligand effect of M on the PdCu electrocatalytic performance for MOR. Cao et al. reported the synthesis of quasi-2D PdCu bimetallic trigonal hierarchical nanoframes (THNFs) based on ascorbic acid reduction of Cu2+ and Cu seed-mediated growth of Pd [81]. Among the obtained binary alloys, Pd5.89Cu was found to deliver the highest mass activity of 4520 A g−1, and Pd8.57Cu had the largest specific activity of 5.94 mA cm−2. The ECSA values of most of the THNFs were larger (108.6 m2· g Pd - 1 ) than that of commercial Pd black, suggesting a high degree of Pd utilization. Xu and coworkers prepared a heterostructure consisting of 2D NiZn oxyphosphide nanosheets and 3D PdRu nanoflowers by a facile wet-chemistry strategy using NaBH4 as the reducing agent and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as the protecting agent [54]. From the TEM image in Fig. 4 a, one can see that the PdRu alloy nanoflowers consisted of interconnected nanosheets grown on the NiZn oxyphosphide nanosheet surface. In 1 M KOH + 1 M methanol or ethanol, the heterostructure delivered a specific/mass activity of 4.5 mA cm−2/1739.5 A g−1 for MOR (Fig. 4b) and 12.3 mA cm−2/4719.8 A g−1 for EOR (Fig. 4c), respectively. The incorporation of NiZn oxyphosphide nanosheets enhanced the cycling stability as well as electrocatalytic activity, where the poisoning resistance resulted from its ability of water dissolution that facilitated the recovery of poisoned electrocatalysts. The retention rate of the specific/mass activities reached >70% after 1000 successive cycles (Fig. 4d and 4e). 2D PtSn nanosheets (sub-1 nm thickness) were prepared by Tuan’s group through a facile colloidal method and used as effective electrocatalysts for both MOR and EOR [55]. AFM and high-resolution TEM measurements showed that the thickness ranged from 0.6 to 0.9 nm. With surfactants controlling the growth of six facet directions, stacked hexagonal nanostructures were formed, as evidenced in SEM measurements (Fig. 4f). Electrochemically, the obtained PtSn nanosheets exhibited a mass activity towards MOR (871.6 A g Pt - 1 ) 2.3 times (371 A g Pt - 1 ) and 10.1 times (86.1 A g Pt - 1 ) higher than that of commercial Pt/C and Pt black, respectively, and a mass activity towards EOR (673.6 A g Pt - 1 ) 5.3 and 2.3 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C (295 A g Pt - 1 ) and Pt black (127.7 A g Pt - 1 ), respectively. Lv et al. used a surfactant template, docosyltrimethylammonium chloride, to prepare ultrathin, free-standing trimetallic PdPtCu nanosheets with ascorbic acid as the reducing agent [82]. The surfactant facilitated the formation of a lamellar nanostructure, which exhibited linear voids after the removal of the surfactant (Fig. 4g). From the CV curves in Fig. 4h, the PdPtCu nanosheets were found to exhibit an ECSA of 46.3 m2 g−1, as compared to 20.9 m2 g−1 of PdPt nanosheets, 30.1 m2 g−1 of PdCu nanosheets, and 19.4 m2 g−1 of monometallic Pd nanosheets, and apparent electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of methanol, ethanol, glycerol, and glucose. Wang’s group used Ag triangular nanoplates to prepare 2D porous PtAg alloy nanosheets through a galvanic replacement reaction [83]. Because ascorbic acid was used as the reducing agent, excessive oxidative corrosion of the Ag triangular nanoplates was avoided and the nanoplate morphologies were retained (Fig. 4i). In the solution of 1 M KOH + 1 M methanol, the PtAg porous nanosheets achieved a specific anodic current density of 10.04 mA cm−2, which was 4.5 times that of commercial Pt/C (2.24 mA cm−2). The PtAg nanosheets also exhibited remarkable stability, retaining 19.4% of the current density (1.95 mA cm−2) after continuous operation for 5000 s, in comparison to almost complete loss with Pt/C. The remarkable activity was ascribed to the unique 2D porous architectures that featured plenty of catalytically active sites for effective electron and mass transport. The AOR performances of these different 2D noble metals and alloys are summarized in Table 1 ."
4,Metal oxides and hydroxides,"Due to their excellent physical and electrochemical properties, transition metal oxides and hydroxides have emerged as viable substitutes for precious metals towards the electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohols [84-87]. Several important parameters need to be considered, such as high structural stability, high resistance against electrochemical corrosion, good electrical and proton conductivity, and high specific surface area. Among these, 2D nanosheets of transition metal oxides and hydroxides, such as NiO, spinel nickel cobaltate (NiCo2O4), and LDHs, have been attracting much attention. Generally, alkaline electrolytes are preferred for transition metal oxides and hydroxides, because the catalysts are more stable in alkaline electrolyte than in acidic media. The possible pathways of AOR on divalent metal oxides and hydroxides (such as cobalt- and nickel-based electrocatalysts) are listed below [88-90], in which the trivalent oxyhydroxide MOOH serves as the adsorption sites and oxidants for AOR, (8) MO + OH− ↔ MOOH + e− (9) M(OH)2 + OH− ↔ MOOH + H2O + e− (10) MOOH + RCH2OH ↔ MOOH−(RCH2OH)ads (11) MOOH + MOOH−(RCH2OH)ads → M(OH)2 + MOOH−(RCH2O)ads (12) MOOH + MOOH−(RCH2O)ads → M(OH)2 + MOOH−(RCHO)ads (13) MOOH + MOOH−(RCHO)ads → M(OH)2 + MOOH−(RCO)ads (14) MOOH−(RCO)ads + OH− → M(OH)2 + RCOO−"
5,Transition metal oxides,"3.1 Transition metal oxides A range of transition metal oxides have been found to exhibit electrocatalytic activity towards AOR. For instance, NiO is an attractive candidate, where the main limiting factors are its poor electrical conductivity and low utilization rate as electrode materials [91]. Preparation of 2D sheet-like nanostructures can improve the effective utilization of the active materials and at the same time create abundant oxygen vacancies on their surfaces, leading to an increase of the defect states in the forbidden band and thus improved electrical conductivity. For instance, Luo et al. prepared 2D ultrathin NiO nanosheets with rich oxygen vacancies (VO-rich ultrathin NiO nanosheets) through a facile hydrothermal and calcination procedure [92]. For comparison, they also prepared NiO nanosheets poor in oxygen vacancies (VO-poor ultrathin NiO nanosheets) by prolonged calcination, and bulk NiO by direct high-temperature calcination of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Fig. 5 a). The VO-rich nanosheets achieved a large current density of 85.3 mA cm−2 towards MOR, more than twice that (36.9 mA cm−2) of the VO-poor counterpart and almost four times that (23.9 mA cm−2) of bulk NiO (Fig. 5b), along with improved catalytic stability. Results based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the formation of abundant oxygen vacancies indeed decreased the band gap and increased the electrical conductivity. NiCo2O4 is another attractive material [93,94]. For instance, Xiao’s group prepared NiCo2O4 nanospheres by the assembly of porous nanosheets [95]. From the TEM image in Fig. 5c, one can see that the NiCo2O4 nanospheres exhibited a wrinkled, porous structure consisting of numerous stacked nanoparticles. From nitrogen adsorption and desorption measurements, the BET specific surface area was estimated to be 146.5 m2 g−1. The nickel foam-supported electrode (NiCo2O4/NF) exhibited a current density of 40.9 A g−1 in 1 M KOH + 0.5 M methanol, about an order of magnitude higher than the background current of 4.6 A g−1 in 1 M KOH. Furthermore, the NiCo2O4/NF electrode exhibited a negligible decrease in current density in long-term stability and durability tests for MOR."
6,Transition metal hydroxides,"3.2 Transition metal hydroxides Transition metal hydroxides, including layered single metal hydroxides and LDHs, have a typical open layered, 2D structure with an easily adjustable interlayer distance [96,97]. LDHs with the general formula of M 1 - x 2 + M x 3 + ( O H ) 2 2 - A x / n n - ·mH2O and a diverse chemical composition have also been used in the electrocatalysis of AOR [16,98-100]. For instance, Chen et al. prepared 2D ultrathin NiAl−LDHs nanosheets by a simple hydrothermal and mechanical liquid-exfoliation method [90]. AFM measurements (Fig. 5d) showed that the exfoliated nanosheets consisted of single or double layers, with the thickness ranging from 0.75 to 0.88 nm. In electrochemical measurements for EOR in 1.0 M NaOH and 1.0 M ethanol, the oxidation current density of NiAl−LDHs nanosheets (543.33 A g−1) at + 0.58 V vs. Ag/AgCl was 39 times higher than that of bulk NiAl−LDHs (13.65 A g−1) (Fig. 5e); and 91.6% and 81.8% of its initial current density was retained after continuous operation at + 0.58 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 2000 s and 10000 s, which is much better than that of bulk NiAl−LDHs. The ultrathin LDH nanosheets allowed for the exposure of a great number of active sites. More importantly, exfoliation led to the formation of Ni(III) active species (NiOOH) on the nanosheets, which played a critical role in determining the catalytic activity towards EOR. The NiOOH also improved the electrical conductivity of the LDH nanosheets. These effects synergistically led to marked enhancement of the EOR activity, as compared to bulk NiAl−LDHs. In another study [101], Hou’s group synthesized Mn−doped Ni(OH)2 nanosheets by mixing Mn(OH)2 nanoplates with Ni2+ (Fig. 5f). As the solubility product of Ni(OH)2 is lower than that of Mn(OH)2, the Mn(OH)2 templates were sacrificed to introduce Ni2+ as the dopant, and the doped sample was found to exhibit a larger peak current density (Fig. 5g) and better cyclic stability than the pristine one toward EOR. XPS studies (Fig. 5h) showed that the prepared sample exhibited a higher binding energy of the Ni 2p3/2 electrons than that of undoped Ni(OH)2, which was beneficial to increase the number of nickel active species and hence the electrocatalytic activity."
7,Metal oxide − hydroxide hybrids,"3.3 Metal oxide − hydroxide hybrids Compared with transition metal oxides or hydroxides, 2D metal oxide-hydroxide hybrids show enhanced electrochemical performance, due to their rich composition, synergistic effect between ions, and high electrical conductivity. For instance, Chen and colleagues fabricated composites based on CuO nanoparticles supported on Co(OH)2 ultrathin nanosheets as efficient electrocatalysts for MOR and investigated the influence of the amount of Cu on the electrocatalytic performance [102]. The as-obtained sample at the Cu/Co molar ratio of 1:2 (sample 3) delivered the best electrocatalytic performance among the series. At the potential of +1.65 V vs. RHE, sample 3 exhibited the highest peak current density of 764 A g−1 (159 mA cm−2) in the electrolyte solution of 1 M KOH + 3 M methanol (Fig. 5i). In addition, sample 3 exhibited the largest turn-over frequency of 2.55 s−1, a lowest Tafel slope of 92 mV dec−1, and best electrochemical stability (only 30% loss in 1000 cycles). The enhanced performance was attributed to the formation of [Co(OH)2]+ species that led to enhanced binding energy of Co and O. Similarly, Wang et al. synthesized 3D hierarchical binary metal oxide NiCo2O4 nanoflowers consisting of cross-linked 2D NiCo2O4 nanosheets decorated with nanoparticles by a facile microwave-assisted hydrothermal route, which provided a loading platform for the further growth of Ni(OH)2 nanoparticles [103]. The intertwined sheet-like nanostructures were evidenced in field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) measurements (Fig. 5j). The anodic oxidation current density of the nanocomposites loaded on a glassy carbon electrode (NiCo2O4/Ni(OH)2/GCE) was estimated to be 92.3 A g−1, in comparison to the negligible current density with the GCE alone. In addition, the NiCo2O4/Ni(OH)2/GCE exhibited the best stability among the series, where 94.6% of the initial current density was retained after refreshing the electrolyte solution (Fig. 5k). The remarkable electrocatalytic activity was ascribed to the hierarchical morphology of NiCo2O4 nanoflowers and the high activities of Ni(OH)2. In summary, 2D transition metal oxides, hydroxides, and their composites can be used as high-performance electrocatalysts for AOR, due to high electrochemical stability, good electrical and proton conductivity, high specific surface area, as well as rich composition, and synergistic interactions between the ions."
8,Metal carbides,"Transition metal carbides (MxCy) [33], in particular, tungsten carbide, display Pt−like catalytic behaviors, and are viewed as promising catalysts to replace precious metals in DAFC [40,104-106]. However, the high density results in a small specific surface area and low electrocatalytic activity, which hampers their applications in electrocatalysis. Such issues can be mitigated by using porous nanostructures of the carbide materials, because of enhanced exposure of active sites, efficient mass transport, increased release of gas bubbles, suppressed agglomeration of catalysts, and enlarged interfaces between different components. In alkaline electrolytes, the possible electrocatalytic mechanisms of AOR on transition metal carbides are listed as follows [107-109], (15) MxCy + RCH2OH ↔ MxCy−(RCH2OH)ads (16) MxCy + OH− ↔ MxCy−(OH)ads + e− (17) MxCy−(RCH2OH)ads + 3OH− → MxCy−(RCO)ads + 3H2O + 3e− (18) MxCy−(RCO)ads + MxCy−(OH)ads + OH− → 2MxCy + RCOO−+H2O where metal carbides provide the adsorption sites for alcohol molecules, activation of water molecules, and formation of adsorbed surface hydroxyls [110,111]. Meanwhile, it is noteworthy that part of the metal carbides (e.g., WC and TiC) [112,113] may become corroded into the corresponding oxygenated species (WO3 and TiO2+), producing OH at a relatively high potential that is critical for alcohol adsorption and CO oxidation [114]. For instance, Li et al. prepared a series of mesoporous WC nanoslices by an easy, two-step strategy that included a hydrothermal pretreatment followed by a carburization reduction process [115]. The sample prepared at 700 °C (WC700) exhibited a specific area of 31.7 m2 g−1, pore size distribution in the range of 3–15 nm, and average aperture of 6.2 nm, in comparison to 9.46 m2 g−1, 3–60 nm and 10.0 nm for WC750. The obtained WC nanoslices showed higher catalytic activity than both 5% and 10% Pt/C towards MOR in acidic and alkaline media. Zheng et al. fabricated nanocrystalline WC thin films on graphite substrates by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition in a H2 and Ar atmosphere, using WF6 and CH4 as the precursors [116]. The resulting film electrode exhibited an ECSA of 49.3 cm2, a peak current of 123.6 mA cm−2 in the solution of 0.5 M H2SO4 + 2 M methanol at 70 °C, and the oxidation peak potential of only +0.306 V vs. SCE."
9,Metal−based composites,"To further enhance the electrocatalytic activity of single metal oxides/hydroxides or metal carbides, a small amount of noble metals, typically Pt, can be added to form a composite [33]. In these catalysts, the 2D metal oxides and carbides usually serve as the co-catalyst and substrate support for the dispersion of the noble metals, where the synergistic interactions lead to enhanced adsorption and dissociation of alcohols."
10,Metal-metal oxide composites,"5.1 Metal-metal oxide composites The (noble) metal domains in the heterogeneous metal–metal oxide nanocomposites typically exhibit enhanced activity towards AOR, due to the synergistic effects between the structural components, e.g., electronic coupling and lattice strain effect. The electron donating/withdrawing effect from the metal oxide can alter the electron density around the metal sites, and thus affect their catalytic properties by changing the adsorption energy of reactants on the metal surface, leading to enhanced electrocatalytic activity and anti-toxicity [117]. The mechanism of alcohol electrooxidation catalyzed by Pt/MxOy nanocomposites in alkaline electrolytes is summarized below [118,119], (19) Pt + RCH2OH ↔ Pt−(RCH2OH)ads (20) Pt−(RCH2OH)ads + 3OH− → Pt−(RCO)ads + 3H2O + 3e− (21) MxOy + OH− ↔ MxOy−(OH)ads + e− (22) MxOy−(OH)ads + Pt−(RCO)ads + OH− → MxOy + Pt + RCOO−+H2O where one can see that Pt serves as the anchoring and oxidation sites for alcohols, whereas MxOy facilitates the formation of hydroxyl species that drives further oxidation of the Pt−adsorbed intermediates [120]. For instance, utilizing the Ar plasma exfoliation technique, Zhang and colleagues prepared Pt nanoparticles-loaded ultrathin WO3 nanosheets, which exhibited enriched oxygen vacancies and increased electrical conductivity, as remarkable electrocatalysts towards MOR [121]. From Fig. 6 a, the agglomerated Pt nanoparticles can be seen to exhibit an average particle size of 3.34 nm. After the exfoliation treatment by Ar plasma of the as-prepared bulk WO3, oxygen-deficient WO3 nanosheets (denoted as WO3−Ar) were produced with the chemical formula of WO2.72 or W18O49, as confirmed by the 〈010〉 planes in HRTEM measurements (Fig. 6b), which were favorable for the dispersion of Pt nanoparticles. Electrochemical measurements of Pt/WO3−Ar in N2−saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 showed that the reduction peak potential shifted positively, while the peak potential for CO stripping showed a slightly negative shift. This suggests its bifunctional roles of enhanced MOR activity and CO tolerance. The peak current density of Pt/WO3−Ar in 0.5 M H2SO4 + 1 M methanol was measured to be 2.27 mA cm Pt - 2 or 1250 A g Pt - 1 , which is much higher than those of pristine Pt/WO3 (1.44 mA cm Pt - 2 or 480 A g Pt - 1 ) and Pt/C (0.77 mA cm Pt - 2 or 320 A g Pt - 1 ) (Fig. 6c). In another study, Zhang and coworkers fabricated Pt−hematene nanosheets by ultrasonic exfoliation followed by double-pulse electrodeposition. The hematene nanosheets were facilely exfoliated by a two-step ultrasonic treatment of hematite α−Fe2O3 powders [122]. TEM measurements showed that the as-synthesized Pt−hematene nanosheets consisted of Pt nanoparticles with the size ranging from 8 to 10 nm. In the electrolyte solution of 1 M KOH + 1 M methanol, the peak mass activity of Pt−hematene nanosheets was estimated to be 181 mA mg−1, which is lower than that (563 mA mg−1) of commercial 40 wt% Pt/C but higher than those of relevant examples reported in the literature (57 mA mg−1 for Pt−CeO2(1.3:1)/C, 150 mA mg−1 for Pt−NiO/C, and 125 mA mg−1 for Pt/PIN/GC). This was accounted for by the oxophilic nature of Fe2O3 that improved the adsorption of OH species, leading to enhanced anti-poisoning."
11,Metal−metal carbide composites,"5.2 Metal−metal carbide composites In alkaline media, the electrocatalytic mechanism of AOR by metal–metal carbide composites is similar to that by metal–metal oxide composites [111,123-125]. For instance, Lang et al. prepared Pd nanoparticles loaded on 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene based on selective etching by HF and chemical reduction by formic acid [126]. From the TEM image of Pt/MXene (Fig. 6d), one can see that a small number of Pd nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed on the ultrathin MXene nanosheets, which led to a high specific activity due to the relatively low mass loading of Pd. In the alkaline electrolyte of 1 M KOH + 1 M methanol, Pt/MXene exhibited a higher peak current density (12.4 mA cm−2) than commercial Pd/C (7.6 mA cm−2) (Fig. 6e). Consistent results were observed in the Tafel slopes and turnover frequencies of the catalysts, suggesting that the support of MXene indeed accelerates the reaction kinetics and thus enhances the MOR activity. More importantly, based on the results from XPS measurements and DFT calculations, it was proposed that the introduction of 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene as the support induced strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) with the Pd nanoparticles, where electron transfer from MXene to Pd optimized the electronic structure of Pd towards methanol adsorption and oxidation. Additionally, the possible hydrogen bond formation between methanol and MXene also aided methanol adsorption and facilitated the oxidation kinetics. In an early study, Wang et al. prepared Pt nanoparticles-decorated Ti3C2 MXene and observed an enhanced electrocatalytic performance towards MOR, as compared to commercial Pt/C [127]. From the TEM image of Ti3C2 MXene, one can see that the sample exhibited a layered structure with an interlayer spacing of about 9.8 Å. This provided abundant sites for the growth of Pt nanoparticles (4–5 nm in diameter, Fig. 6f). Electrochemical measurements showed that the ECSA of Pt/Ti3C2 MXene was 60.1 m2 g−1, much larger than that of Pt/C (30.2 m2 g−1). From Fig. 6g, the MOR peak current density of Pt/Ti3C2 MXene (1.137 mA cm−2) was almost three times that of Pt/C (0.388 mA cm−2). Furthermore, 85.1% of the ECSA value was retained after 1000 potential cycles from + 0.05 to + 1.2 V, in comparison to only 53.2% for Pt/C. Chen et al. prepared a Pt/Mo2C electrocatalyst with optimized Pt−Mo2C chemical bonding and evaluated the EOR activity [128]. The chemical bonding of Mo2C to Pt particles rendered exceptional EOR activity at low potentials, which was 15 and 2.5 times higher than those of Pt/C and commercial 40% PtRu/C, respectively, at +0.6 V vs. RHE. The stability of the Pt/Mo2C/C electrocatalyst was comparable to commercial 40% PtRu/C. CO stripping test demonstrated the formation of highly active sites for CO oxidation on Pt/Mo2C/C. Porous trimetallic Pt69Rh8Fe23 nanospheres supported on 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets as co-catalyst for EOR were also prepared via a one-step solvothermal route, where OAm was used as a mild reducing agent and solvent and CTAB as the capping agent and etchant [129]. The introduction of Rh and Fe not only facilitated the splitting of the C−C bond and the generation of oxygen-containing species, but also reduced the adsorption of CO−type intermediates. TEM studies (Fig. 6h) showed that ternary Pt69Rh8Fe23 nanospheres of ca. 51.4 nm in diameter were dispersed homogeneously on the surface of MXene nanosheets, which delivered a peak current density of 3407.7 A g−1 and retention of 72.8% of the initial activity after 1000 successive cycles, as compared to 805.3 A g−1 and 58% of Pt/C TKK (Fig. 6i). The AOR performances of these different 2D metal oxides/hydroxides, metal carbides, and metal-based composites are also listed in Table 2 ."
12,Summary and perspectives,"In this review, we summarized the preparation methods, unique structures, and corresponding AOR performances (specific activity and durability) of a range of 2D functional nanostructures, including noble metals and alloys, transition metal oxides/hydroxides, transition metal carbides, and precious metal-based composites. Effective electrocatalysts are identified to possess a high activity towards the dehydrogenation of alcohols, production of oxygen-containing species, adsorption of CO and OH species, and effective C−C bond cleavage. There are at least four critical factors in the design and engineering of these 2D electrocatalysts: (i) elemental composition that dictates the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity; (ii) size and surface morphology that impact the mass transfer and accessibility of catalytic active sites; (iii) interfacial interaction for the reduction of energetic barrier for charge transport and suppression of unwanted side reactions; and (iv) synergistic interactions between structural components in nanocomposites to manipulate adsorption of important reaction intermediates and hence electrocatalytic activity. Despite substantial progress in recent years, critical issues remain. Notably, noble metal nanostructures have remained the leading catalysts towards AOR. Further structural engineering is needed to reduce their use (cost) without compromising the electrocatalytic performance. Concurrently, development of noble metal-free, viable alternatives is urgently needed. Towards this end, a major obstacle is the lack of in-depth understanding of the catalytic mechanisms (in particular, unambiguous identification of the catalytic active sites). This presents particular challenges in the utilization of C2+ alcohols (i.e., ethanol, propanol, ethylene glycol, glycerol, etc.) as fuels, due to the high energy barrier in breaking the C−C bonds and hence the difficulty in improving the fuel cell performance to a new level. Towards this end, a deliberate integration of state-of-the-art theoretical simulations and modeling into rational material design represents a unique route. In addition, development of effective strategies for the preparation of such 2D catalysts is critically needed, in particular, with select surface morphologies, structural defects, and crystalline phases. Furthermore, in situ and operando analysis of the catalyst structure is strongly desired to unravel the mechanistic contributions to the electrocatalytic activity, in particular, for multicomponent nanocomposite catalysts."
