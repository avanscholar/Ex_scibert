0,Introduction,"Nowadays, polymers, e.g. plastics, have been widely used in everyday life. Till now, most polymers are still derived from petroleum sources [1]. The dependency on depleting fossil and increment of greenhouse gas emission has triggered the search for more sustainable alternatives. As the largest renewable organic carbon source, biomass could produce sustainable chemicals to potentially replace the ones derived from fossil fuels [2]. Moreover, for monomers containing oxygen functionalities, the biomass route may take advantage of the inherent functionalities present in biomass (e.g., alcohols, C=O bonds, etc.). Life cycle analysis has shown that biomass-derived chemicals have a significantly lower carbon footprint than fossil fuel-derived counterparts [3]. As a result, products made from sustainable source become more appealing to policymakers and customers that are concerned with sustainability. Furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) were listed as TOP 14 most important biomass-derived platform chemicals by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) [4], since they contain versatile functional groups and can be easily produced from hemicellulose and cellulose through hydrolysis and dehydration. Multiple monomers, such as furfuryl alcohol (FA), 2,5-bis-(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHF), 2,5-bis-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran (BHTF), 1,5-Pentanediol (1,5-PDO), 1,6-Hexanediol (1,6-HDO), and 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), etc., can be produced through catalytic conversion of furfural and HMF, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2 . These monomers include molecules with a known market that currently produced from petroleum (e.g., 1,6-HDO), and “new” molecules (e.g., FDCA and BHTF) which have uncertainty in the market and applications. The current price for most of these monomers is high since their production scales are usually small [3]. However, the cost of these molecules could be significantly lowered once they can be produced at a larger scale. Among these monomers, FA is commonly used for the manufacture of foundry resins. It can also be copolymerized with other chemicals to produce polymers with excellent chemical, thermal, mechanical, and anti-corrosion properties [5]. BHF is a crucial starting molecule for varieties of industrially important polymerization or etherification processes, including the preparation of new functionalized polyethers [6], furanic polyamides [7], and polyurethanes, etc. Both FA and BHF can be produced via selective hydrogenation of carbonyl group in furfural and HMF, respectively, while avoiding ring hydrogenation. BHTF can be used to produce biobased polyesters [8,9] and generally regarded to be more stable than the unsaturated BHF [10]. Unlike BHF, the production of BHTF from HMF requires hydrogenation of both furan ring and carbonyl group. 1,5-PDO and 1,6-HDO were used as feedstocks to produce unsaturated polyester, polyurethane, surfactant, plasticizer, medicine, and other food and cosmetics-related chemicals [11–13]. Both 1,5-PDO and 1,6-HDO production requires ring opening reactions from THFA and BHTF, respectively, with the latter requires an additional hydrodeoxygenation step. FDCA is a potential alternative to produce recyclable bio-based polymers, such as polyamides, polyurethanes, and esters, among which polyethylene furanoate (PEF) is especially important due to its potential replacement for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) [13,14]. FDCA can be produced from HMF through consecutive oxidation steps, among which the oxidation of aldehyde moiety in 5-formyl-2-furancarboxylic acid intermediate (FFCA) has been regarded as the limiting step. It should be noted that the focus of the current manuscript is on monomers that derived from furfural and HMF. Other important chemicals involved in the reaction network of Figs. 1 and 2 that cannot be used as monomers are beyond the scope of the review [15,16]. Given the multi-functionalities of furfural and HMF, the major difficulty for the production of the monomers shown in Figs. 1 and 2 is how to efficiently and selectively convert specific functional group(s) in furfural and HMF. Moreover, special attention needs to be paid to catalyst stability due to the high tendency of condensation/polymerization for reactants and/or (intermediate) products that cause carbonaceous deposit on the catalyst surface. Also, some reactions are conducted in the aqueous phase at elevated temperatures, which raises the hydrothermal stability issue. Given the above issues, many efforts have been made to design and modify catalytic sites, including a selection of metal/support, use of synergy between metal and support, tuning metal size, use of inverse catalysts (e.g. metal covered by oxide), adding catalytic promoters, constructing bimetallic sites, etc. In the current review, recent development in heterogeneous catalysis for the production of bio-based monomers from two important biomass-derived platform chemicals, furfural and HMF, will be reviewed and summarized. To keep the scope concise, only 6 monomers that we believe to be particularly important, including FA, BHF, BHTF, 1,5-PDO, 1,6-HDO, and FDCA, are discussed and the primary focus is on studies in recent five years. Firstly, the production of FA and BHF is summarized, due to their similarity during the catalytic conversion. Then, the production of BHTF from HMF is discussed, followed by the production of 1,5-PDO and 1,6-HDO from FA and HMF, respectively. Finally, the catalytic oxidation of HMF to FDCA is reviewed. A summarized overview is given in the conclusion section in terms of catalyst design strategies for the efficient and selective production of these monomers."
1,"Furfuryl alcohol (FA) and 2,5-bis-(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHF)","It was reported in 2014 that around 62% of furfural had been converted into FA globally [5,17], which is mainly used for production of foundry resins. Resins made with FA itself as well as copolymerization with other chemicals, such as formaldehyde, phenolic compounds, urea, etc., exhibited prominent chemical, thermal and mechanical properties [5]. FA has also been used to produce furan fiber-reinforced plastics for use in piping, due to its anti-corrosion properties. Besides, FA derived polymers were also used as a carbon source of molecular sieves for potential applications as confined nanopore chemical reactors [18] and carbon membranes for gas separation [19]. Of the many HMF derived products, BHF, which is produced by selective hydrogenation of the CO group in HMF, is a crucial starting molecule for many industrially important polymerization or etherification processes, including the production of new functionalized polyethers [6], polyurethanes, furanic polyamides [7], multi-heteromacrocycles [12] and biodiesel [11], etc. Because of its high potential as monomers to produce alternative and renewable materials [13], efficient production of BHF via heterogenous catalysis has received great attention [14]. In the following paragraphs, we summarize the state-of-the-art heterogeneous catalysis for conversion of furfural to furfuryl alcohol and conversion of HMF to BHF (Table 1 ). It is important to keep in mind that in many cases, the mechanism by which the site construction/modification affects surface chemistry is unclear, and multiple effects may be at play. Generally, there are two types of catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of furfural/HMF to FA/BHF: (1) Cu based catalysts; (2) non-Cu catalysts with reducible supports. The advantage of Cu based catalysts is mainly due to the fact that unlike other metals typically used in hydrogenation, such as Ni, Pd, Pt, Ru, Ir, Rh, etc., Cu generally has low activity in furan ring hydrogenation and relatively high activity to CO bonds hydrogenation [20,21]. Moreover, the other metals, such as Pd and Pt, often promote hydro-deoxygenation and ring hydrogenation as well [10]. Currently, the industrial process for furfural hydrogenation to FA employs a copper chromate catalyst [22]. Although the copper chromate shows great activity and selectivity towards FA, the disposal of toxic Cr2O3 is prohibited in landfill sites. So, the use of chromate is highly undesirable. Moreover, typical conditions for this industrial process are pressures up to 30 bar and temperature between 130 and 200 °C. Therefore, the development of efficient alternative catalysts capable of operating at milder temperature and pressure and utilizing less toxic components has received great attention [17]. Recently, multiple strategies have been applied to increase the efficiency of Cu based catalysts, such as adding promoters, constructing bimetallic catalysts, controlling the dispersion of Cu, etc. Using a Cu/ZnO catalyst synthesized by coprecipitation method, Yang et al. improved FA yield up to 94% at a temperature as low as 120 °C [23]. The excellent catalytic performance was attributed to proper size of Cu (~8 nm) and metal-support interactions. Moreover, by supporting CuO and CeO2 on γ-Al2O3 and then stripping the excessive CuO on the surface, Jackson et al. found the resulting CuO–CeO2/γ-Al2O3 could achieve a FA yield of 85% at 175 °C under a low pressure of 5 bar, outperforming their control catalysts of Cu/Al2O3 and copper chromite [24]. Furthermore, a bimetallic Cu–Co/SBA-15 was reported to lead a high FA yield of 80% during furfural hydrogenation at 170 °C and 20 bar, presumably due to a synergy effect between the Cu and Co [25]. Additionally, a highly dispersed Cu–Co/C catalyst made by Co-doped Cu-BTC metal-organic frameworks through thermolysis in N2 exhibited a high FA yield of 96% under 140 °C and 30 bar H2 [26]. Similarly, Manikandan et al. found a Cu–Fe/Al2O3 catalyst could achieve a FA yield of 92% at 93% conversion under 175 °C and atmospheric pressure [27]. The high activity and selectivity of the catalyst were ascribed to the oxygen vacancies provided by the Fe and the synergy between Cu and Fe. Due to the similarity between selective hydrogenation of furfural and HMF, Cu based catalysts have also been widely used for BHF production from HMF. However, the aldehyde group of HMF should be selectively hydrogenated without affecting the C-OH groups, so the base with proper alkaline strength or support with tunable acidity were chosen to selective conversion of HMF to BHF. A Cu/SiO2 catalyst was reported to achieve a high BHF yield of 97% after 8 h of reaction at 100 °C under 2.5 MPa H2 [28]. Upare et al. reported Cu–SiO2 nanocomposite materials had excellent performance for this reaction, resulting in a BHF yield of > 97% after 4 h of reaction at 100 °C under 15 bar H2 in butanol [29]. Moreover, using a copper-doped porous metal oxide derived from hydrotalcite with a composition of Cu0.59Mg2.34Al1.00 and surface area of 196 m2 g-1, Kumalaputri et al. detected a 97% yield of BHF after 3 h of reaction in ethanol at 100 °C and 50 bar H2 [30]. Additionally, to inhibit the deactivation of Cu-based catalysts due to the formation of carbonaceous species on the catalyst surface, Zhu et al. found that the Cu–ZnO catalyst derived from a mixture of rosasite and aurichalcite showed a BHF selectivity of 94.4% at a conversion of 97.5% after 1 h reaction at 140 °C under 1.5 MPa H2 using 1,4-dioxane as the solvent, largely outperformed commercial RANEY® Cu catalyst [21]. Similarly, a CuZn nanoalloy powder was reported to achieve a BHF yield of 95% after 3 h reaction at 120 °C under 70 bar H2 [31]. It was proposed that using Cu–Zn binary minerals as precursors enhanced dispersion of Cu and the high surface concentration of Cu sites led to a high yield of BHF [21]. The second type of catalyst, non-Cu catalysts, for selective hydrogenation of carbonyl group in furfural and HMF often requires the use of reducible oxides as catalyst supports. Typically used metals include Pt, Pd, Ru, Ir, Co, etc., which generally have stronger hydrogenation ability than Cu. Therefore, for most cases, hydrogenation over these catalysts can be carried out at relatively milder conditions compared to Cu-based catalysts. However, due to these metals are not as selective as Cu for activation of the carbonyl group, proper choice of support becomes important to facilitate the selective hydrogenation. An et al. performed furfural hydrogenation reactions in a gas phase flow system and found that compared to silica, using TiO2 and Nb2O5 as supports for Pt catalysts promoted the production of FA via carbonyl group hydrogenation in contrast to furan formation [32]. Sum frequency spectroscopy studies and density functional calculations also indicated that metal-support interactions are important for Pt on TiO2, which facilitates hydrogen spillover and concomitant formation of a furfuryl-oxy intermediate over titania, while the oxygen vacancies on the TiO2 surface promote the formation of the furfuryl-oxy intermediate [33]. Moreover, a stabilized cobalt catalyst covered by a TiO x layer, which was produced by high-temperature reduction of TiO2 supported Co nanoparticles, was reported to achieve a high yield of FA (95%) during aqueous phase hydrogenation of furfural in a continuous flow reactor at 80 °C and a weight hourly space velocity of 17.5 h−1 under 2.34 MPa [34]. Similar as furfural, the use of reducible oxides also facilitates selective hydrogenation of HMF to produce BHF. Cai et al. reported that unlike Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/SiO2 which mainly produced total hydrogenation product BHTF (BHF selectivity of ~5% at almost full conversion), Pd/TiO2 resulted in a BHF selectivity of ~50% at the same conversion under the same reaction conditions (1 h, 6 MPa H2, 50 °C in water) [35]. They also found that 5% Ir/TiO2 could achieve a BHF selectivity higher than 95% at a conversion higher than 99% after 3 h of reaction at 50 °C under 6 MPa H2 in water, whereas 5% Ir/C only showed a 93% conversion and 70% selectivity toward BHF under the same conditions [35]. Therefore, with the reductive support TiO2, non-Cu metals exhibited the ability to selectively hydrogenate the carbonyl group while leaving the furan ring unchanged, which is possibly because that the interaction between the reducible support and metal created oxygen vacancies at the interface which can bond to the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group through a lone pair of electrons and results in the CO bond activation for selective hydrogenation [36–39]. Except for TiO2, other reducible oxides were also employed for the HMF hydrogenation to BHF. For example, Alamillo et al. obtained 81% yield of BHF over a Ru/CeO2 catalyst along with only 4% yield of BHTF after 2 h of reaction at 130 °C under 400 psi H2 in a water/1-butanol biphasic system [40]. Additionally, Tamura et al. used an Ir–ReO x /SiO2 catalyst for the HMF hydrogenation and achieved a 99% yield of BHF after 6 h of reaction at 30 °C under 0.8 MPa H2. It was proposed that the ReO x promoted the substrate adsorption as well as heterolytic dissociation of H2, which led to high activity and high selectivity, respectively [41]. One major problem associated with catalytic hydrogenation of furfural and HMF is acid-catalyzed side reactions, which can be divided into two categories: formation of carbonaceous deposits and ring-opening reactions. Due to the functionality of furfural and HMF, both themselves and their hydrogenation products are susceptible to condensation and polymerization. It has been proposed that there are three types of reactions that lead to the formation of carbonaceous deposits: aldol condensation, Friedel−Crafts-type reaction and Diels−Alder cycloaddition [10]. The acid sites are usually from catalyst supports or acidic products in the reaction medium. For example, Wang et al. [42] studied the effect of acid/basic properties of support for Cu based catalysts, including ZSM-5, SiO2, Al2O3, MgO, and ZnO. They found that the acidic support led to a low mass balance due to the extensive amount of oligomers formation. On the contrary, basic support led to a higher mass balance and FA became the major product. Moreover, fast deactivation of Cu/Al2O3 was reported for the hydrogenation of FA due to thermal polymerization and coking of furfuryl alcohol [43]. Additionally, Perret et al. [44] used a Ni/Al2O3 catalysts prepared from Ni–Al layered double hydroxides for HMF hydrogenation and found that the catalyst deactivation was mainly due to coke formation that resulted from polymerization. The acid in the reaction medium can also be byproducts from hydrolysis. For example, the hydrolysis product of formic and levulinic acid from HMF was reported to promote humins formation, which can block metal sites [13]. The presence of acid sites may also promote ring-opening reactions. Alamillo et al. found that even mild acidic support SiO2 promoted the ring-opening to form triols, such as 1,2,5-hexanetriol and 1,2,6-hexanetirol [40]. Also, acidic byproducts from hydrolysis, such as formic and levulinic acid, were found to promote ring-opening of HMF and its reaction intermediates [13,40]. Except for using non-acidic support, typically methods to prevent acid-catalyzed side reactions during furfural and HMF hydrogenation include addition of alkali or alkaline earth metal into catalysts to modify the acid-based properties of supports [45] and neutralization of acidic reaction medium by adding basic solutions [13]."
2,"2,5-bis-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran (BHTF)","BHTF can be produced through total hydrogenation of HMF (shown in Table 2 ). BHTF can be used to produce biobased polyesters [8,9] and generally regard to more stable than unsaturated furan compounds, such as BHF [10]. Generally, Ni is regarded as the most selective metal for the total hydrogenation of HMF [20]. Traditional Raney Ni catalyst showed 100% selectivity towards BHTF [44,46]. However, the reaction typically requires very large amount of Raney Ni. To increase the mass-based activity, supported Ni catalysts were usually used [47,48]. Another problem of Ni-based catalysts is leaching, especially when water is used as the solvent [20]. Usually, compared to aqueous phase hydrogenation over noble metal catalysts, Ni-based catalysts only showed a comparable catalytic activity in organic solvents [11]. However, hydrogenolysis of biomass and the subsequent dehydration is mainly carried out in water. So, the choice of water as a solvent for the subsequent transformation of HMF is of great importance. Therefore, from the perspective of economy it is highly favorable to exploit the water-compatible catalysts for the BHTF formation. Compared to Ni-based catalysts, noble metal catalysts are generally more active and more resistant to leaching. The higher activity of noble metal catalysts is mainly due to their higher dispersion than Ni-based counterparts, leading to higher weight-based activity. However, noble metal catalysts usually show activity in various side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis of C–O or C–C bonds, and therefore their selectivity toward total hydrogenation tends to be lower. For example, it was reported that Pd and Ru catalysts were active in the total hydrogenation while their selectivity was poorer than Ni catalysts, especially in acidic reaction conditions with water as solvent [20,40]. The Ru catalysts promoted CO bond hydrogenation at relatively low temperatures while catalyzed ring-opening reaction to form triols at high temperatures. Moreover, except for the ring hydrogenation, the Pd catalysts also promoted decarbonylation. Therefore, for noble metal-catalyzed total hydrogenation, careful control of reaction conditions and catalyst support is usually required to achieve high selectivity toward the total hydrogenation. In this regard, it was reported that supports with high isoelectric points, such as Ru/CeO2, could achieve a high BHTF yield of 91% whereas supports exhibiting Brønsted acidity, such as Ru/SiO2, promoted ring opening to form polyols and polymers [40]. Moreover, the selectivity to BHTF also decreased when acidic impurities, such as levulinic acid, were present in the reaction medium. Additionally, a Pd/Al2O3 catalyst was reported to result in a BHTF yield > 99% after 3 h of HMF hydrogenation in ethanol under 70 bar H2 at an intermediate temperature of 120 °C [31]. To integrate the high selectivity of Ni and high activity of noble metals, bimetallic catalysts were constructed and evaluated for the total hydrogenation of HMF. A bimetallic catalyst of Ni–Pd/SiO2 (Ni/Pd = 7) exhibited a 96% yield of BHTF after 2 h of reaction at 40 °C and 8 MPa H2 in aqueous solution [49]. It was reported that the Ni–Pd/SiO2 catalyst had higher activity than commercial Raney Ni and higher selectivity than Pd/C. It should be noted that the segregation of Pd on the outer layers in the Ni–Pd bimetallic particles has been reported, which may affect the synergy between the Ni and Pd [50]. Moreover, despite the good catalytic performance of the Ni–Pd/SiO2, problems of Ni leaching were not solved: reuse of the catalyst lowered the conversion down to 39% and selectivity to BHTF down to 21% [49]. In order to overcome the leaching problem, bimetallic catalysts with a combination of noble metals were developed for the aqueous total hydrogenation of HMF. A Pd–Ir/SiO2 catalyst was reported to achieve a BHTF yield of 95% after 4 h of reaction at 2 °C under 8 MPa H2 in water [51]. The Pd–Ir/SiO2 exhibited much higher turnover frequency for CO hydrogenation and ring hydrogenation than the monometallic Pd or Ir catalyst. The synergy effect between Pd–Ir was reported to be specific to hydrogenation of substituted furans and low reaction temperature and high H2 pressure were beneficial to achieve high BHTF yields."
3,"1,5-pentanediol (1,5-PDO) and 1,6-hexanediol (1,6-HDO)","1,5-PDO and 1,6-HDO have received growing attention in their conversions to valuable unsaturated polyester, polyurethane, surfactant, plasticizer, medical (agricultural) medicine, etc. [52–55]. Currently, the worldwide consumption of 1,5-PDO ($6000/ton) and 1,6-HDO ($3000–4500/ton) is about 3 kton/year and 150 kton/year, respectively [3,56,57]. Till now, they have been mainly produced through petroleum-based routes. 1,6-HDO is mainly produced from benzene through five reaction steps [58], during which the conversion of the oxidation step must be kept low since the desired intermediates (cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol) tend to undergo undesired over-oxidation at high conversions. Also, the subsequent oxidation to form adipic acid involves use of a corrosive reagent (nitric acid) and the formation of a harmful gas (N2O). On the other hand, 1,5-PDO is mainly produced by catalytic hydrogenation of glutaric acid or its derivatives, which is restricted by limited accessibility of C5 petrochemical feedstocks [3]. In contrast, the biomass-derived routes to produce 1,5-PDO and 1,6-HDO typically require selective hydrodeoxygenation of a bio-based oxygenate, e.g. FA, HMF and their derivatives, instead of reduction and oxidation of a hydrocarbon molecule (Table 3 ). Therefore, the biomass-based routes could potentially require fewer reaction steps and avoid use of toxic reagents. Moreover, a lower CO2 footprint is expected for the biomass-based routes compared to petroleum-based routes. The biomass-derived routes to produce 1,5-PDO often involve direct hydrogenolysis of tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), a ring hydrogenation product of FA [59]. Typically used hydrogenolysis catalysts include noble metal Rh, Pt, bimetallic Pd–Ir, Rh–Re, Rh–Ir, and trimetallic Pd–Ir-Re catalysts, etc [34,60–66]. Reports on non-precious metal catalysts, such as Cu, Ni, Co, are relatively fewer due to their poor selectivity caused by overhydrogenolysis [34,60–66]. Generally, metal-support interfacial sites or bimetallic interfacial sites were considered to be the active sites where C–O bond in furan ring was adsorbed, activated and then underwent hydrogenolysis due to cooperative catalysis of different sites [63,67,68]. Generally, monometallic catalysts, e.g. Rh, Pt, Ir, lead to nonselective C–O ring hydrogenolysis since the C2–O bond on THFA is more sterically hindered than its C5–O [34,62,69–72]. In order to enhance the selectivity to 1,5-PDO, transition metals (Re, Mo, W, V, etc.) or their oxides were added to achieve preferential hydrogenolysis of the C2–O bond which is more sterically hindered [34,62,71,73]. Moreover, it is desirable to use reducible metal oxides as supports or promoters to facilitate adsorption of oxygen functional groups in FA or THFA [65,74]. For example, Rh-ReO x /SiO2 catalyst was reported to achieve a 80.1% selectivity toward 1,5-PDO at a 96% conversion of THFA while its Rh/SiO2 counterpart was much less active and selective with 1,2-PDO being the major product [73]. It was proposed that the selective hydrogenolysis of THFA was facilitated by the interaction between the C–OH group and the ReO x . Similarly, a 4 wt% Rh-ReO x /C catalyst was reported to achieve a 97.2% selectivity to 1,5-PDO at a 47.2% conversion of THFA, largely outperformed a 4 wt% Rh/C in terms of activity and selectivity [69]. Catalyst characterization combined with DFT calculations suggested the Rh-ReO x provided bifunctional sites that facilitate selective hydrogenolysis by acid (Re-OH) catalyzed ring-opening and Rh catalyzed hydrogenation. The acid-promoted C–O activation was proposed to proceed through protonation of the O in the ring and then ring-opening, after which formation of a secondary carbenium was preferred since it can be stabilized via a Coulombic interaction with its neighboring oxygen on the hydroxyl group. The formation of secondary carbenium is key to selective production of 1,5-PDO. Similar promotion effect was observed when MoO x was added to the Rh/C catalyst. Chen et al. also reported that a 94% yield of 1,5-PDO over an Rh-ReO x /C catalyzed THFA hydrogenolysis at 100 °C and 8 MPa H2 [75]. Other combinations of noble metal and transition metal (oxides) were also reported for 1,5-PDO production from THFA or Furfural. Feng et al. found that adding 5% of WO3 into Pt/ZrO2 increased the 1,5-PDO yield from 0% to 36% under equivalent reaction conditions, while a 1,5-PDO yield of 43% could be achieved using the Pt/WO3/ZrO2 with a longer reaction time [65]. It was proposed that the promoted 1,5-PDO formation was due to the formation of Brønsted acid sites by the addition of WO3 and the WO3/ZrO2 interfacial sites were active sites for the THFA hydrogenolysis. It was speculated that the ZrO2 promoted adsorption of the C–O bond in furan, while the activated hydrogen species spillover from Pt to the WO3/ZrO2 interface to reduce WO and form Brønsted acid sites which activate the C–O bond to facilitate hydrogenolysis. The major byproduct was 1-pentanol due to the consecutive hydrogenolysis of 1,5-PDO. The speculated mechanism was shown in Fig. 3 . Liu et al. developed a Pd–Ir-ReO x /SiO2 catalyst which achieved a 71.4% yield of 1,5-PDO (at 99.9% conversion) from furfural in a one-pot two-step reaction, during which the Pd-ReO x was proposed to mainly catalyze hydrogenation of furfural to THFA (40 °C), followed by selective ring-opening to produce 1,5-PDO (100 °C) that was mainly catalyzed by the Ir-ReO x [76,77]. Replacement of Pd by Rh improved the 1,5-PDO yield from 71.4% to 78.2% with shorter total reaction time, although the Rh–Ir-ReO x /SiO2 catalyst has stronger tendency for aggregation than the Pd–Ir-ReO x /SiO2 [76,77]. The higher 1,5-PDO yield from Rh–Ir-ReO x /SiO2 is due to its higher hydrogenolysis activity than the Pd–Ir–ReO x /SiO2, which may be derived from the different intrinsic activity of Rh compared to Pd. The Rh–Ir–ReO x /SiO2 can also achieve a 71.1% isolate yield of 1,5-PDO when highly concentrated furfural (50%) was used as reactant. Since furfural can be easily polymerized to generate humins at high concentration and conversion of highly concentrated furfural makes large-scale industrial production more cost-effective, efficient production of 1,5-PDO from concentrated furfural could be important for industrial applications. Since the interface of metal and transition metal oxide is key for selective ring-opening and hydrogenolysis, attempts have been made to construct catalysts with large interfacial areas. Kuang et al. prepared Pt/WO3@SiO2 catalyst by embedding WO3 in a mesoporous SiO2 framework with a sol-gel method, which exhibited excellent performance with 82.9% conversion of THFA and 72.9% selectivity toward 1,5-PDO [74]. It was proposed that the special structure offered not only plentiful active sites due to highly dispersed Pt and WO3 but also synergistic effect between them that leading to the formation of Brønsted acid sites of H x WO3 species. In contrast, the use of Pt/WO3 made by commercial WO3 and Pt-WO3/SiO2 made by consecutive impregnation only achieved a low conversion of THFA (< 20%) under the same conditions. Furthermore, Wang et al. reported a Pt/WO x /C catalyst in which the WO x was added by atomic layer deposition over pre-synthesized Pt/C achieved a ~80% selectivity to 1,5-PDO at 20% conversion of THFA, outperformed conventional Pt-WO x /C catalyst made by impregnation, possibly due to more abundant Pt-WO x interfacial sites of the former even though its WO x loading was much lower [64]. It was proposed that the thin oxide submonolayer of WO x on the Pt surface was the active interface site due to the oxide submonolayer acting as Brønsted-acid site for selective C–O cleavage and stabilizing the oxocarbenium-ion. Typically used non-precious metals for 1,5-PDO production from furfural and its derivatives include Cu, Ni, Co-based catalysts. Generally, their activity and selectivity are lower than the ones from precious metal catalysts [34,62,71]. Liu et al. reported that Cu–Al2O3 prepared by a co-precipitation method achieved a 70.3% selectivity toward pentanediols (include 1,5-PDO and 1,2-PDO) at a 85.8% conversion of FA, outperforming Cu-based catalysts with other supports, such as SiO2, TiO2, ZrO2, and ZnO, under equivalent experimental conditions [78]. It was proposed that the acidic feature of the Al2O3 support and its intimate interactions with Cu nanoparticles greatly enhanced its hydrogenolysis activity. However, its selectivity toward 1,5-PDO is only 22.2%, which is much lower than the one of 1,2-PDO (48.1%). Moreover, Shao et al. reported that addition of Mg to CuAl catalyst improved both conversion of FA and selectivity to 1,5-PDO, although a limited selectivity of 17.5% was obtained at a FA conversion of 90.9% [79]. Both the CuAl and CuMgAl catalysts were made by co-precipitation methods. It was suggested that the addition of Mg to CuAl not only promoted the dispersion of Cu but also provided basic Mg sites that can assist the ring-opening reactions. Furthermore, Gavilà et al. reported one-pot conversion of furfural to 1,5-PDO using Co–Al spinel-based nanoparticles to replace the use of noble metal catalysts, which achieved a 29.8% yield of 1,5-PDO at full conversion with the negligible 1,2-PDO formation and THFA being the major by-product [80]. The activity towards the hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis of furfural was attributed to a collective effect between surface acidity of the spinel and metallic Co nanoparticles. It was found that reduction at higher temperatures, which facilitated the formation of the surface metallic cobalt nanoparticles, promoted the hydrogenolysis to form diols. Similarly, Sulmonetti et al. prepared a highly dispersed Cu–Co–Al mixed oxide catalyst by calcining layered double hydroxides, which achieved a 1,5-PDO selectivity of 44.7% at a FA conversion of 97.8%. The addition of Cu to the Co–Al system promoted 1,5-PDO formation and facilitated reduction of Co oxide species [62]. It was proposed that a proper ratio of metallic species and surface oxides was necessary to promote the 1,5-PDO formation during which the Co2+ promoted ring-opening while Cu0 and Co0 promoted hydrogenation. In addition, Gao et al. developed Cu–LaCoO3 catalyst derived from perovskite, which can achieve a 40.3% selectivity toward 1,5-PDO at full conversion of FA while much less 1,2-PDO was formed [81]. They found that the balance between Cu0 and CoO sites played a crucial role in the 1,5-PDO formation, during which collaborative catalysis between the Cu0 and CoO facilitated the selective hydrogenolysis while the Co0 promoted the hydrogenation. Combinations of non-noble metals and reducible oxides were also used for the hydrogenolysis of furfural derivatives to produce 1,5-PDO. Lee et al. used a TiO2 layer coated Co–TiO2 catalyst made by high-temperature reduction (600 °C) of supported Co/TiO2 for hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis of FA to produce 1,5-PDO [34]. The catalyst achieved a 30.3% 1,5-PDO selectivity at 99% conversion. In contrast, Co/TiO2 reduced at lower temperatures led to much lower selectivity towards 1,5-PDO. It was suggested that the high-temperature reduction created overcoats of TiO2 on Co by “strong metal-support interaction”, thereby improving bifunctionality in the Co/TiO2 system to enable selective ring-opening. The formation of TiO2 layer also protected the Co nanoparticles against leaching and sintering. Soghrati et al. prepared a bifunctional Ni-WO x catalyst to catalyze ring-opening of THFA to form 1,5-HDO, which achieved a 47.3% selectivity to 1,5-HDO at 29% THFA conversion [66]. It was proposed that the strong interaction between W and Ni species enhanced the reducibility of WO x and the Lewis acidity provided by the WO x enhanced both the activity and selectivity. Other Ni-based catalysts were also reported to produce 1,5-PDO. Wijaya et al. prepared Ni–Y2O3 catalyst by co-precipitation and hydrothermal methods, a 47.8% isolate yield of 1,5-PDO was achieved at full conversion of FA when the Ni/Y mole ratio was kept at 2.5 [63]. The major byproduct was THFA, an intermediate product, while only a minimal amount of 1,2-PDO was produced. It was proposed that the 1,5-PDO was produced over the Ni0–Y2O3 interface which is active and selective in the C–O bond scission of the tetrahydrofuran ring. However, the yield of 1,5-PDO decreased to 15.3% when reusing the catalyst in spite of full conversion being maintained, due to deposition of polymerization product on the Ni0–Y2O3 boundary. They also prepared Ni–La(OH)3 composite catalysts for the same reaction and achieved a 55.8% isolate yield of 1,5-PDO at full conversion of FA with a 31.7% yield of intermediate THFA [61]. Similar to the 1,5-PDO synthesis, catalytic conversion of HMF or its derivatives BHTF to 1,6-HDO also relies on the acid sites to promote ring-opening and metal sites to activate hydrogen. Therefore, similar combinations of metals and metal oxides, e.g. Rh, Ir, Pt, ReO x , WO x , TiO2, etc., were applied. Generally, it is more difficult to produce 1,6-HDO by one-step hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis from HMF than from BHTF or 1,2,6-hexanetirol (1,2,6-HTO). Several industrial researchers have studied catalytic conversion of BHTF to 1,6-HDO. For instance, Rennovia, an American company, built a pilot plant for bio-derived 1,6-HDO and claimed a better profit margin than the petroleum-based route from benzene. A Pt-WO x /ZrO2 catalyst was used in the process. However, the overall yield and catalytic activity were not reported [82]. Moreover, Dupont patented a route for 1,6-HDO synthesis with 83% yield from hydrogenolysis of BHTF over a Pt-WO x /TiO2 catalyst at 160 °C and 5.5 MPa with a reaction time of 24 h, although very limited information was provided about the Pt-WO x /TiO2 catalyst and its structure-property relationships [83]. Many researchers have attempted to realize efficient production of 1,6-PDO from HMF and its derivatives and provide more insights into the catalytic structure-performance relationship. Buntara et al. reported one-pot conversion of BHTF into 1,6-HD using a combination of Rh–Re/SiO2 and Nafion SAC-13 as catalysts, which achieved a 86% yield of 1,6-HDO at full conversion after 20 h aqueous phase reaction at 120 °C under 1–8 MPa H2 [84]. The one-pot conversion involved three reaction steps: (1) hydrogenolysis of BHTF to form 1,2,6-HTO catalyzed by the Rh–Re/SiO2; (2) ring closure of 1,2,6-HTO to form tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-ylmethanol (2-THPM) catalyzed by the Brønsted acids, Nafion SAC-13; (3) hydrogenolysis of 2-THPM to form 1,6-HDO catalyzed by the Rh–Re/SiO2. The one-pot process was feasible since both the hydrogenolysis of BHTF and 2-THPM could be catalyzed by the same catalyst and conditions. Similarly, He et al. used a Pt-WO x /TiO2 catalyst to convert BHTF to 1,6-HDO and obtained a 70% yield at full conversion [85]. There were two steps involved in the process, including ring-opening of BHTF to 1,2,6-HTO and hydrogenolysis of 1,2,6-HTO to 1,6-HDO. They found that the hydrogen spilled over from Pt to WO x /TiO2 could reduce the WO to form Brønsted acid sites and the synergy between the metal and acid sites was critical to the high yield of 1,6-HDO. Attempts have also been made to produce the 1,6-HDO directly from HMF. Xiao et al. performed catalytic conversion of HMF to 1,6-PDO over double-layered catalysts consisting of Pd/SiO2 (top layer) and Ir-ReO x /SiO2 (bottom layer) in a fixed-bed reactor and obtained a 57.8% yield of 1,6-HDO at full conversion [86]. A mixture of water and THF was used as solvent. The double-layered catalysts largely outperformed single Pd–Ir-ReO x /SiO2 catalyst, and the 1,6-HDO yield was significantly affected by the water/THF ratio, since Brønsted acid sites were formed on the catalyst in the presence of water which was vital to 1,6-HDO formation. It was proposed that the upper layer Pd/SiO2 catalyzed the hydrogenation of HMF to produce BHTF, which was then catalyzed by the bottom layer acid-containing Ir-ReO x /SiO2 to form 1,6-PDO through ring-opening hydrogenolysis and hydrodeoxygenation. The high-pressure H2 used in the study also contributed to the high yield of 1,6-HDO due to its depression on over-hydrogenolysis, the speculated reaction routes were shown in Fig. 4 . Furthermore, Tuteja et al. used Pd/zirconium phosphate catalyst to produce 1,6-HDO from HMF at atmospheric pressure with formic acid as a hydrogen source [87]. A 42.5% yield of 1,6-HDO was achieved at 96.9% conversion of HMF and the catalyst showed good reusability. It was suggested that the proper Brønsted acidity on the zirconium phosphate support promoted the C–O bond scission in furan ring while the Pt catalyzed the decomposition of formic acid to generate hydrogen in situ for hydrogenolysis reactions."
4,"2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA)","FDCA, generally produced via HMF oxidation, is a potential alternative to produce recyclable bio-based polymers, such as polyamides, polyurethanes, and esters [1,88,89]. It can also be used as a pharmaceutical intermediate, corrosion inhibitor, and crosslinking agent for polyvinyl alcohols [11,90]. A great advantage of FDCA is to form polyethylene furanoate (PEF) coupled with mono-ethylene glycol that realizes completely replacement for polyethylene terephthalate (PET). It was estimated that the use of bio-based PEF can lower energy usage by 43%–51% and decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 46%–54% compared to the use of petroleum-based PET [91]. The estimated market value for FDCA is to reach $500 million by 2020 with a unit price of $1100/ton [1,3]. Many studies have focused on the oxidation of HMF to FDCA using heterogeneous metal catalysts in both organic and aqueous media with oxygen/air/peroxides as the oxidant [88,92]. Generally, three types of catalysts were used (Table 4 ): (1) noble metal catalysts such as Pt, Au, Pd, Ru, etc. [93–98]; (2) bimetallic catalysts, such as Pd–Bi, Au–Pd, Au–Cu, etc. [91,99,100]; (3) non-noble (oxide) catalysts, such as FeO x , MnO x , CeO x , etc. [101–104]. It is common to dissolve a base in the reaction medium for conversion of HMF to FDCA since the base could neutralize the FDCA to form salt, which inhibits precipitation of FDCA on the metal surface and prevents the reaction medium becoming too acidic. In general, two types of reaction pathways from HMF to FDCA were concluded: DFF pathway and HMFCA pathway (Fig. 5 ) [89,105–109]. The reaction could initially proceed through selective oxidation of the hydroxyl group to produce 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) (pathway 1), or through oxidation of the aldehyde group to form 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furan carboxylic acid (HMFCA) (pathway 2). Then, both the DFF and HMFCA could be further oxidized to 5-formyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (FFCA), which is finally converted to FDCA. Notably, the oxidation of the aldehyde group in 5-formyl-2-furancarboxylic acid intermediate (FFCA) has been regarded as the limiting step, for which the preliminary hydration step of the aldehyde function to form the geminal diol is favored by the basic medium. Pal et al. [88], Hameed et al. [89], and Sajid et al. [90] have reviewed the recent development in noble and non-noble metal catalysts for the conversion of HMF to FDCA over past decades. In the current paper, our primary focus is to summarize studies that achieved a high yield of FDCA (> 85%) using heterogeneous catalyst with base or base-free conditions in recent five years. Zhang et al. developed a γ-Fe2O3@HAP-Pd(0) (HAP: hydroxyapatite) catalyst using ion-exchange method [110]. The magnetic γ-Fe2O3 was encapsulated by HAP and the Pd was introduced by exchanging Pd2+ with Ca2+ on the HAP surface (Fig. 6 ). The γ-Fe2O3@HAP-Pd(0) catalyst achieved a 92.9% FDCA yield at 97% HMF conversion after 6 h reaction in an aqueous K2CO3 solution at 100 °C. The same group also developed a Pt/C@Fe3O4 catalyst with carbon shell and Fe3O4 core which achieved 86.7% yield of FDCA at 98.4% conversion of HMF after 6 h reaction in an aqueous K2CO3 solution at 80 °C under atmospheric oxygen pressure [111]. They found that for both catalysts the conversion and yield decreased significantly under base-free condition. It was suggested that the base could neutralize the FDCA to form salt, which inhibited adsorption of FDCA on metal surface. After the reaction, both the γ-Fe2O3@HAP-Pd(0) and Pd/C@Fe3O4 catalysts could be magnetically recovered due to its Fe3O4 core and reused without the loss of its activity. Zhang et al. used similar type core-shell Fe3O4@C@Pt catalysts to obtain a 100% FDCA yield from HMF after 4 h of reaction in Na2CO3 aqueous solution at 90 °C with 100 mL min−1 oxygen flow [112]. A particle size effect was observed that the catalyst with larger Pt particles (~20 nm) showed much higher activity than its counterparts of smaller Pt particles (~1 nm), presumably due to a specific islet morphology and high crystallinity of the larger Pt particles. Also, the use of Na2CO3 was required to achieve a high FDCA yield. Several studies have used CeO2 as support for catalytic conversion of HMF to FDCA due to its ability to provide hydroxide and Lewis acid sites. Au/CeO2 catalysts showed efficient FDCA production during aerobic oxidation of HMF in aqueous base solution at a temperature range of 70–140 °C [93,95]. It was suggested that the Au–CeO2 interaction and maximizing the interfacial area was crucial to promoting catalytic activity. Li and co-workers reported the effect of CeO2 morphology on Au–CeO2 catalyzed conversion of HMF to FDCA, which showed rod CeO2 largely outperformed cube CeO2 and octahedra-CeO2. The enhanced performance was ascribed to higher oxygen vacancies of the Au/CeO2-rod, which led to larger proportion of cationic gold and more interfacial Lewis acidic sites that beneficial for the conversion [113]. Similarly, Rabee and co-workers also reported the effect of support morphology on tuning the FDCA selectivity from HMF conversion using monoclinic and tetragonal Au/ZrO2 [114]. Miao et al. reported that although Pt/CeO2 showed a poor performance in catalytic conversion of HMF to FDCA, Bi-doped Pt/CeO2 showed an excellent catalytic activity, achieving a 98% FDCA yield after 30 min reaction at room temperature in an aqueous NaOH solution [115]. The promotion effect of Bi was attributed to the excellent oxygen activation ability of the Bi-doped ceria which accelerated the oxygen reduction process through a large abundance of oxygen vacancies and the quick scission of peroxide intermediate. Similar promotion effect was observed for a Pt–Bi/TiO2 catalytic system [91,99,100], where the addition of Bi improved both activity and stability by increasing Pt resistance to oxygen poisoning and promoting oxidative dehydrogenation of alcohol group through interaction between the oxophilic Bi and a π electron of the furan ring [116]. A FDCA yield higher than 99% was obtained within 5 h reaction at 100 °C using Na2CO3 aqueous solution over Pt–Bi/TiO2 (Bi/Pt = 0.22) under 4 MPa air, compared with more than 8 h without Bi promotion [91,99,100]. Similar to other reports, the reaction was blocked when it was carried out without the addition of a homogeneous base, due to precipitation of the FDCA on the catalyst under a low pH environment and promotion effect of basic medium on the rate-limiting FFCA oxidation. Xia et al. also observed the promotion effect of bimetallic Au/Pd catalysts for oxidation of HMF to FDCA [117]. The bimetallic Pd–Au catalyst (Au:Pd = 4) showed excellent performances for oxidation of the intermediate product 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furanic acid (HMFCA), resulting in a 90% FDCA yield after 6 h reaction at 60 °C. To the contrary, the monometallic Pd or Au catalyst had poor catalytic performance since they could not oxidize the HMFCA. The enhanced activity was ascribed to the electronic synergy between Pd and Au because of the alloy formation. The electron was transferred from Pd to Au during the alloy formation, which tuned the adsorption and activation of reactant and intermediates to result in the high yield of FDCA. The bimetallic Au/Pd catalyst also exhibited good reusability during the oxidation [117]. The effect of base strength on the catalytic conversion of HMF to FDCA was also studied. Yi et al. compared Na2CO3, K2CO3, Hydrotalcite, CaCO3 and NaOH by adding the same amount of base as HMF over a commercial Ru/C catalyst (120 °C, 5 h, 0.2 MPa O2) and found that the stronger base (NaOH) led to lower FDCA yield (69%) while highest FDCA yield (95%) was achieved over the weaker base CaCO3, which was due to the degradation of HMF to form a brownish solution at higher pH [94]. Moreover, Chen et al. showed that a 91.3% yield of FDCA could be achieved from HMF under mild conditions (75 °C, 6 h, 35% H2O2, 0.1 MPa air) over a Ru on activated carbon catalyst (Ru/AC) when H2O2 was used as the oxygen source due to its faster mass-transfer than oxygen gas [96]. To maximize metal-support interfacial area and utilization efficiency of metal, Liao et al. prepared a single atom Pd–MnO2 catalyst, which achieved a 88% FDCA yield at full conversion after 4 h reaction in a K2CO3 aqueous solution at 100 °C under 0.1 MPa oxygen [118]. The single atom Pd–MnO2 catalyst showed higher activity in FDCA production than its Pd nanoparticle counterpart and typically reported Pd-based catalysts. The enhanced catalytic performance was ascribed to the maximized interfacial sites which promoted synergy between Pd and MnO2 through electronic interactions and rich oxygen vacancies for activating HMF and molecular oxygen, respectively. Non-noble metal (oxide) catalysts were also reported for catalytic conversion of HMF to FDCA. Hayashi et al. reported that the activity of MnO2 can afford moderate FDCA yield compared with that of other transition metal oxide catalysts, such as FeO x , CoO x , CuO x , NiO [104]. According to their study, an activated MnO2 achieved a 91% yield of FDCA at 99% HMF conversion after 24 h reaction in a NaHCO3 aqueous solution at 100 °C and 1 MPa O2. When stronger bases were used, such as hydroxides, carbonates, and phosphates, lower FDCA yields (14%–60%) were reported under equivalent conditions and conversions, suggesting that strong bases facilitated the formation of undesired byproducts, possibly humins. Moreover, Bao et al. reported that a holey 2 D Mn2O3 nanoflakes prepared by heat treatment of an Mn-based metal-organic framework (MOF) precursor achieved a nearly complete yield of FDCA after 24 h reaction in a NaHCO3 aqueous solution at 100 °C and 1.4 MPa O2, outperforming commercial Mn2O3 and activated MnO2 [102]. They proposed that the HMFCA reaction pathway dominated during the catalysis using the 2D Mn2O3 nanoflakes, in contrast to the DFF pathway which dominated for most previously reported Mn-based oxides ( Fig. 5) [103], since Mn4+ on the surface of the nanoflakes preferred to adsorb the –OH in geminal diol moiety rather than adsorb the –OH in the hydroxymethyl moiety in the first step. The good performance of the 2D Mn2O3 nanoflakes was attributed to its abundant surface pores and redox cycle of the surface Mn cation. In addition, Han et al. used a non-noble metal catalyst, MnO x -CeO2 (Mn/Ce = 6), prepared by a coprecipitation and achieved a 91% yield of FDCA at a 98% conversion of HMF after 12 h reaction in KHCO3 aqueous solution at 110 °C under 2 MPa O2 [101]. The catalyst could be recycled and reused for five times while maintaining its catalytic activity. The catalytic conversion over the MnO x -CeO2 was proposed through a synergy between Ce and Mn oxides: HMF was firstly adsorbed on Mn4+ to form a metal-alkoxide intermediate followed by hydrogen adsorption, and then converted to an aldehyde, leaving electrons for Ce4+ to Ce3+ transformation. The adsorbed oxygen dissociated and was then activated at oxygen vacancies, and converted into lattice oxygen O2−, accompanied by Ce3+ to Ce4+ transformation. Then, the lattice oxygen was transferred to the MnO2 lattice to react with adsorbed hydrogen, resulting in formation of H2O or the hydroxyl ion. It should be noted that for the abovementioned MnO x based catalysis, the use of a base additive was required to obtain the high yield of FDCA. A major drawback for the abovementioned catalytic conversion of HMF to FDCA was the use of an over amount of bases to dissolve FDCA to avoid its precipitation on the catalyst surface since FDCA has low solubility in many solvents [121]. Moreover, the alkaline medium makes the catalytic oxidation of HMF kinetically favorable and inhibits the self-polymerization of HMF to give higher FDCA yields. Unfortunately, even 2–4 equivalents of base would cause difficulty in isolation of FDCA, forming many waste salts by subsequent acidification [1,90]. To avoid formation of an excessive amount of salts during FDCA recovery, low concentrations of HMF in neutral aqueous was used with the base-free method or undissolved base-solid support [94,102,122–124]. Motagamwala et al. reported that a 5% Pt/C catalyst achieved a 94% FDCA yield from concentrated HMF solution (7.5 wt%) using a 50:50 γ-valerolactone (GVL)/H2O mixture as solvent after 20 h reaction at 110 °C under 40 bar O2 [99]. The Pt/C catalyst was stable under reaction conditions. The better solubility of the GVL/H2O mixture allowed oxidation at high reactant concentrations without a homogeneous base. After the reaction, high purity of FDCA could be crystallized out from the solution by cooling. The H2O not only provided an oxygen source for HMF oxidation [106], but also shifted the equilibrium toward the formation of FDCA instead of the intermediate carbonyl compound since HMF oxidation was reported to go through the geminal diol formation [99]. They also performed a techno-economic analysis which suggested that their approach can produce FDCA at a minimum selling price of $1490/metric ton, which, after further optimization, could be an economically competitive alternative to the current petroleum-based route for FDCA production ($1445/metric ton). Han et al. designed a Pt/C–O–Mg catalyst where the “C–O–Mg” support was prepared by loading Pt onto the surface of a carbon coated MgO [122]. The formation of a C–O–Mg bond made the surface of the support alkaline. During the base-free aqueous phase aerobic HMF oxidation to FDCA, the Pt/C–O–Mg catalyst achieved a 97% FDCA yield at full conversion of HMF after 12 h reaction at 110 °C under 1 MPa O2. Good reusability was reported for the catalyst. Han et al. further synthesized a N-doped carbon-supported Pt using ethylenediamine as nitrogen source, which resulted in a 96% yield of FDCA after 12 h reaction under 110 °C and 1.0 MPa O2 [123]. Characterization showed that the pyridine-type nitrogen introduced a new type of basic site with medium basicity, which attributes to the active and selective oxidation of HMF [123]. It should be noted that for the above two studies, proper amount of sodium hydrate was added after the reaction to recover the FDCA deposited on the catalyst surface, so FDCA salt was still formed. Water was a superior solvent than organic solvents for the reaction possibly due to its protonic feature. A reaction mechanism was proposed: the HMF was converted into DFF via activation of the hydroxyl by Pt and basic sites, followed by oxidation of one formyl group to produce FFCA through an intermediate hemiacetal formation which was catalyzed by the basic sites; then, the second formyl group was oxidized in a similar fashion to form the FDCA, which is usually regarded as the rate-controlling step [125,126]. Similarly, Wang et al. reported that using Mg–Al–CO3 hydrotalcite-supported Pd NPs as catalyst exhibited an excellent catalytic activity (99% yield) without using basic solution due to the proper basicity of the Mg–Al–CO3 and the copious OH- group on the hydrotalcite surface [124]. Bimetallic catalysts were also reported for base-free aerobic oxidation of HMF to FDCA (Table 5 ). Shen et al. prepared a bimetallic Pt–Ni/AC using atomic layer deposition to coat 0.4 wt% Pt nanoparticles on the Ni/AC surface, which showed a 97.5% FDCA yield at full conversion for base-free oxidation of HMF to FDCA at 0.4 MPa O2 after 15 h [127]. It was proposed that the formation of bimetallic Pt–Ni facilitated CO adsorption and oxidation, as compared to monometallic Pt. Moreover, Gupta et al. used high surface area Mg(OH)2 nanoflakes as support for bi-metallic Ni–Pd catalysts, Ni0.90Pd0.10/Mg(OH)2 [128]. The use of this catalyst achieved 100% conversion, > 94% FDCA selectivity and > 86% isolate FDCA yield after 16 h at 100 °C, while other supports, such as Al2O3, SiO2, ZnO, and MgO, showed low conversions of HMF (10%–20%) and high selectivity to byproducts. It was proposed that efficient oxidation of HMF was attributed to the basicity of the support, which avoids the necessity to use an extra base additive. In addition, Gao et al. reported a La-doped Ca–Mg–Al layered double hydroxide (La–CaMgAl-LDH) supported bimetallic AuPd catalyst which showed high activity and stability for the aqueous base-free aerobic oxidation of HMF to FDCA [129]. The catalyst achieved nearly 100% yield of FDCA without deactivation after four consecutive runs. The encouraging performance was attributed to the synergy between the bimetallic Au–Pd and the surface basicity of La–CaMgAl-LDH support, which greatly favors the activation of HMF and reaction intermediates during the consecutive oxidation. Except for basic sites, acid sites on support were also reported to promote the formation of FDCA. Mishra et al. prepared MnCo2O4 spinel supported Ru-catalyst (Ru/MnCo2O4), which exhibited a superior FDCA yield of 99.1% [130]. It was proposed that both Lewis and Brønsted acidic sites on Ru/MnCo2O4 played a crucial role to enhance the yield and productivity of FDCA. Similarly, a Ru/HAP catalyst exhibited a 99.6% yield of FDCA during the base-free aerobic oxidation of HMF to FDCA at 120 °C and 1 MPa O2 [131]. It was proposed that the surface acidic-basic sites on HAP were critical to facilitate the base-free oxidation [131]. Limited studies have been reported for the aerobic base-free oxidation of HMF to FDCA using non-precious metal catalysts. Generally, it is difficult for non-noble metal catalysts to efficiently catalyze the aqueous phase aerobic oxidation of HMF to FDCA without the use of base. Wang et al. reported that a nano magnetically separable Fe3O4-CoO x catalyst obtains 68.6% FDCA yield after 15 h at 80 °C under 70% aqueous t-BuOOH system, along with a relatively high yield of FFCA due to the slow rate from HMF to FFCA [132]. Yan et al. reported an ionic liquid act as the solvent for base-free catalytic conversion from HMF to FDCA over a Fe x Zr 1−x O2 catalyst, resulting in a 60.6% FDCA yield at nearly full conversion [133]. The formation of FDCA was attributed to plentiful acidic and basic sites on the catalyst. However, the low selectivity was due to parallel reaction that leads to humins formation. More recently, using a co-precipitation method, Gao et al. dispersed Co3O4 nanoparticles on amorphous Mn–Co–O solid to obtain a Mn–Co mixed oxide catalyst, Co3O4/Mn x Co [134]. They reported a > 99% FDCA yield when using the Co3O4/Mn0.2Co for HMF oxidation without base additives. The excellent catalytic performance was presumably due to the high density of both Brønsted (Co–O–H+) and Lewis (Mn4+) acid sites on the catalyst surface which promotes adsorption of HMF and formation of COOH. This is the only article, based on our knowledge, to achieved high FDCA yield using non-noble metal catalysts without base additives. Nevertheless, the non-noble metal-based catalysts are more susceptible to metal leaching and active site blockage from carbonaceous deposits [89]. Still, it is promising to explore non-noble metal catalysts for this reaction given their low cost."
5,Conclusions,"The synthesis of biomass-derived monomers has received great attention in recent years, motivated by the depletion of fossil fuels and environmental issues. Moreover, the intrinsic functionality within the biomass or biomass-derived platform chemicals has great potential to produce new types of monomers containing multiple acid or alcohol groups, thereby leading to materials with novel properties. In the current review, recent progress in heterogeneous catalytic production of bio-based monomers from two crucial biomass-derived platform chemicals, furfural and HMF, has been reviewed and summarized. Generally, two types of catalysts were used for FA and BHF production: Cu based catalysts and non-Cu catalysts, such as Ni, Pd, Pt, etc. The advantage of Cu is its high selectivity toward CO bonds hydrogenation versus ring hydrogenation/hydrodeoxygenation in spite of its low hydrogenation activity. Addition of promoters or secondary metal was used to increase the activity of Cu catalysts. In contrast, non-Cu catalysts are generally more active in hydrogenation but often require reducible oxide supports to facilitate selective activation of CO bonds. For BHTF production, Ni is generally regarded as the most selective metal for the total hydrogenation of HMF but it is susceptible to leaching. On the contrary, noble metal catalysts are generally more active and more resistant to leaching but showing lower selectivity due to the promotion of C–O and/or C–C hydrogenolysis. Attempts have been made to construct bimetallic catalysts consisting of Ni and noble metal for selective and active production of BHTF, although it still cannot address Ni leaching. Typically used catalysts for 1,5-PDO production from FA or THFA include noble metal (Rh, Pt, etc.), bimetallic (Pd–Ir, Rh–Re, Rh–Ir, etc.), and trimetallic (Pd–Ir-Re, Rh–Ir-Re, etc.) catalysts. Monometallic catalysts usually lead to nonselective C–O ring hydrogenolysis, so transition metal (Re, Mo, V, etc.) or their oxides were added for preferential hydrogenolysis of the more sterically hindered C2–O bond. Moreover, reducible metal oxides (WO3, ZrO2, TiO2, etc.) are desirable supports or promoters to facilitate adsorption of oxygenous groups in FA or THFA. Usually, reducible oxide promotes adsorption of the C–O bond, noble metal facilitates hydrogen spillover/hydrogenation, and acid site (ReO x , WO x , etc.) promotes hydrogenolysis. Strategies, such as atomic layer deposition (ALD) and core-shell structure, were used to maximize interfacial areas. Reports of non-noble metal catalysts (Cu, Ni, Co, etc.) are relatively fewer due to their lower activity and poor selectivity caused by overhydrogenolysis. Similar to 1,5-PDO, production of 1,6-HDO from HMF or its derivatives also relies on acid sites to promote ring-opening and metal sites to activate hydrogen. Therefore, similar combinations of metals (Rh, Ir, Pt, etc.) and oxides (ReO x , WO x , TiO2, etc.) were applied. Several industrial attempts have been made to produce 1,6-HDO from BHTF, such as Rennovia (Pt-WO x /ZrO2) and Dupont (Pt-WO x /TiO2), and a potential better profit margin than the petroleum-based route from benzene was claimed. For catalytic oxidation of HMF to FDCA, three types of catalysts were reported: (1) noble metal catalysts (Pt, Au, Pd, etc.), (2) bimetallic catalysts (Pd–Bi, Au–Pd, Au–Cu, etc.), (3) non-noble metal (oxide) catalysts (MnO x , CeO x , FeO, etc.). For many cases, it is necessary to dissolve a base in the reaction medium since the base not only neutralizes the FDCA to prevent its precipitation on the catalyst surface, but also promotes the oxidation of the aldehyde group. Reducible oxides (CeO2, TiO2, etc.) were used as support owing to their ability of providing oxygen vacancies to accelerate the oxygen reduction process. Similarly, Bi was used as a catalytic promoter, due to its superior oxygen activation ability. In addition, synergy between bimetallic systems, such as Pd–Au, was reported to boost FDCA formation due to the change of electronic properties upon alloy formation which mediates the adsorption and activation of HMF and intermediates. Single metal atom catalysts have been made to further maximize the metal-support or bimetallic interactions. On the other hand, non-noble metal (oxide) catalysts are less active than noble metal catalysts. To improve their activity, attempts have been made to increase surface area and synergy between bimetallic oxides (MnO x -CeO2). To avoid the formation of excessive amount of salts during FDCA production, attempts of base-free method have been made, such as use of solvent system that can dissolve FDCA and use of undissolved solid-base supports (carbon coated MgO, N-doped carbon, Mg–Al–CO3 hydrotalcite, etc.). Non-noble metal catalyzed base-free oxidation has been limited reported except for a Mn–Co mixed oxide, for which the high content of surface Lewis and Brønsted acid sites promotes HMF adsorption and COOH group formation. It should be noted that biomass-derived polymers are not necessarily bio-degradable. The biodegradability depends on specific conditions and environments. Although many biomass-derived polymers do not strictly fit into the category of bio-degradable, they are more susceptible to depolymerization due to the abundance of ester-type linkages. Therefore, instead of using conventional methods (landfilling, incineration) to deal with polymer wastes, a more sustainable approach of chemical recycle by depolymerization might be more feasible for biomass-derived polymers, which implies another advantage of biomass-derived monomers."
