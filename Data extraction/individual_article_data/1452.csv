0,Introduction,"Catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions play a key role in the chemical industry particularly in the synthesis of various pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals apart from bulk chemicals. Furfuryl alcohol (FOL) and cyclohexanone (Cyone) are the typical examples produced by the hydrogenation of furfural (FAL) and dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol (CyOH), respectively, over Cu-based catalysts. FOL is an important chemical, mainly used for the production of resins for bonding foundry sand to produce cores and molds for metal casting, corrosion-resistant mortar for installing acid proof brick, laminating resins for corrosion resistant fiberglass-reinforced equipment, resins for corrosion resistant furan polymer concrete, impregnating solutions and carbon binders. It is also used as non-reactive diluent for epoxy resins, modifier for phenolic and urea resins, oil-well sand consolidation, solvent, production of tetrahydro furfuryl alcohol and other chemical synthesis. It is also an important chemical intermediate for the manufacture of lysine, vitamin C, lubricant, dispersing agent and plastisizer. Cyone is an industrially important chemical for the manufacture of caprolactum and adipic acid, which are used in producing polyamide fiber in nylon-textiles. Industrially, FOL is produced by hydrogenation of FAL either in liquid phase or in vapor phase. On the other hand, Cyone is produced in vapor phase by dehydrogenation of CyOH. Both the processes employ copper based catalysts. Hitherto, a number of methods have been reported in patent literature on the preparation of catalysts useful for the hydrogenation of FAL and dehydrogenation of CyOH separately. Various copper chromite based catalysts are reported for the hydrogenation of FAL in both liquid as well as vapor phase at high pressures [1–5]. Certain other reports on the non-chromium catalysts for hydrogenation of FAL include Cu/C catalysts [1], Raney Ni and Ni amorphous alloys [6–8], mixed Cu–Zn oxides doped with Al, Mn and Fe [9], and homogeneous complexes of Rh, Ru and Pt [10]. We have reported high yields of FOL by the hydrogenation of FAL & CyOH dehydrogenation over Cu-MgO catalysts at atmospheric pressure [11,12]. Copper chromate catalysts have been patented for dehydrogenation of CyOH in vapor phase and some other copper based catalysts, viz., Cu-MgO, Cu-ZnO, Cu-Al2O3 and CuO-ZnO-Al2O3 are also reported extensively for the dehydrogenation of CyOH either in liquid or vapor phase [13,14]. The main drawbacks of the FAL hydrogenation processes mentioned above are either to be operated under pressure or use large amounts of hydrogen along with FAL. Since both FAL hydrogenation and CyOH dehydrogenation processes employ mostly Cu based catalysts, the combination of these two processes over a single catalyst system seems to be economical. Thus, the present work highlights a catalytic process for the combination of FAL hydrogenation (without H2 pumping) and CyOH dehydrogenation in vapor phase conditions. Hydrogen is the latest successor of energy providers, with many social, economic, and environmental benefits to its credit. H2 is a clean and green fuel producing highly safe by-products, viz., H2O and thus is focused as the high potential fuel of the future world. Hydrogen consumption in the chemical industries alone for various synthetic processes account for >40% of the total H2 produced every year. This implicates the preciousness of H2 and its high demand to the world today and tomorrow. Thus, the present process, which applies in situ generation and application of H2 in the reaction, i.e., without using any external H2 source, can be seen as a novel and an economically viable process. Although there are certain reports [15–17] on this type of coupling reactions which involve a catalytic hydrogen transfer, the present report is an attempt in combining two industrially important reactions, viz., an exothermic furfural hydrogenation and endothermic equilibrium constrained cyclohexanol dehydrogenation with good amounts of desired products. Our earlier reports over Cu-MgO coprecipitated catalyst showed high activities towards both hydrogenation of furfural and dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol. The commercial catalyst used in the hydrogenation of furfural is a copper chromite catalyst. Hence, Cr2O3 promoted Cu-MgO catalyst has been chosen in the present study."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts The catalytic hydrogenation of furfural and dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol both individually and combined were carried out on three catalysts, viz., Cu-MgO (CM), Cu-Cr2O3-MgO (CMCr) and Cu-1800P, a Commercial catalyst. All the chemicals used for the preparation of catalysts were of AR grade obtained from M/s. LOBA chemie, India except for tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide that was obtained from M/s. Aldrich Chemicals. 2.1.1 Cu-MgO CM was prepared by precipitating the mixture of 1M each of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and Mg(NO3)2·6H2O aqueous solution with 1M aqueous solution of K2CO3 at a pH of 9 under continuous stirring. The precipitate was washed until pH is 7. The gel was filtered and dried in an oven for 12h at 383K. The dried sample was then subjected to calcination in air at 723K for 4h to get CM. The final catalyst was found to contain 24wt.% Cu. 2.1.2 Cu-MgO-Cr2O3 CMCr was prepared by coprecipitation of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, Mg(NO3)2·6H2O and Cr(NO3)3·9H2O in ethanol solution with 20wt.% tetra ethyl ammonium hydroxide solution at a pH of 9. The obtained gel was then washed with ethanol, filtered, dried in an oven for 12h at 383K and calcined in air at 723K for 4h. The final mass contained 22wt.% Cu-4wt.% Cr2O3-74wt.% MgO. 2.1.3 Cu-1800P A commercial copper chromite catalyst obtained from M/s. Engelhard corporations, USA."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization All the catalysts have been characterized for specific surface area by N2 adsorption at 77K using a M/s. Micromeritics Pulse Chemisorb 2700 instrument. Before the measurement, the samples were oven-dried at 393K for 12h and flushed in-situ with He gas for 2h. XRD Patterns were recorded on M/s. Rigaku's Miniflex diffractometer with Ni filtered Cu Kα as a radiation source at a 2θ scan speed of 2°min−1. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) studies of the catalysts were performed on the same pulse reactor used for surface area measurement with 6% H2–Ar as reducing gas and carrier gas. The temperature was increased linearly at a ramp of 5Kmin−1 from room temperature to 973K where the isothermal conditions were maintained for 30min. The change in the H2 concentration was monitored by micro TCD and recorded on GC work-station. The elaborated experimental details of TPR were discussed elsewhere [18]. Kratos Axis 165 XPS Spectrometer, with Mg Kα radiation, (1253.6eV), was used for obtaining XPS data. In the XPS study, C 1s-binding energy value of 285eV has been taken as a reference level. The relative intensities of the surface composition of different elements were corrected with their corresponding atomic sensitivity factors using the vision two software in unix system. Prior to the XPS studies, all the catalysts were reduced in 6% H2 balance He flow at 523K for 4h, followed by passivation in N2 atmosphere."
4,Activity measurements,"2.3 Activity measurements The independent hydrogenation, dehydrogenation and simultaneous (hydrogenation and dehydrogenation) reactions were carried out in a fixed bed micro reactor made of quartz (10mm i.d. and 200mm long) packed with 1g catalyst under vapor phase conditions using a liquid cyclohexanol and/or furfural at a feed rate of 1mlh−1, at atmospheric pressure and reaction temperature in the range of 453–523K. In the combination reaction, cyclohexanol:furfural ratio is maintained at 5:1. The products were collected in a cold trap and analyzed at regular intervals by injecting in to a GCMS–QP-5050 (M/s. Shimadzu Instruments, Japan) with DB-5 capillary column (0.32mm dia. and 25m long, supplied by M/s. J & W Scientific, USA)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Structural characteristics of the copper catalysts,"3.1 Structural characteristics of the copper catalysts Table 1 presents the structural characteristics, viz., BET surface area by N2 adsorption and crystalline phases determined by XRD analysis of the various copper catalysts studied. There is a significant increase in the surface area of Cu-MgO-Cr2O3 catalyst (CMCr) prepared by precipitation using tetra ethyl ammonium hydroxide. It is well documented [19–21] that the use of organic precursor and media can change the properties of the resulting materials especially that of mixed metal oxides prepared by co-precipitation method. The surface area of the final solid thus depends mainly on the precursor and the method of preparation adopted. Numerous reports [22,23] reveal the formation of nano-particles of the materials by the use of organic precursor/media. Thus, the enhancement in the surface area of the CMCr may be attributed to the more dispersed Cu-catalyst obtained by precipitation with tetra ethyl ammonium hydroxide. Also, the presence of Cr2O3 is reported to have improved both BET surface area as well as the Cu surface area of the catalyst [24]. The purpose of using tetra ethyl ammonium hydroxide as precipitating agent is to prepare a highly active catalyst for the combination of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions."
7,X-ray diffraction results,"3.2 X-ray diffraction results The results of XRD analysis of both the calcined and reduced samples of copper catalysts are presented in Table 1. The predominant phases observed in the calcined and reduced CMCr and Cu-1800P catalysts are shown in Fig. 1 . In CMCr calcined catalyst phases due to CuO (diffraction lines with d values of 2.52 x , 2.32 x and 2.535; ICDD file No. 5-661) and MgO (d-values of 2.11 x , 1.495 and 1.221; ICDD file No. 4-829) are visible. Same observation is made in case of Cu-MgO catalyst [12]. However, the commercial Cu-1800P showed only CuO phase. Cu2O phase (d-values at 2.47 x , 2.144 and 1.513; ICDD file No. 5-667) is observed as a minor phase in both the catalysts. No d-lines corresponding to Cr2O3 are observed in any of the catalysts which may be due to the low amount of Cr2O3 (4wt.%) in CMCr and Cr2O3 may be present either in X-ray amorphous form or as fine particles below X-ray detection levels in Cu-1800P. The XRD patterns of reduced catalysts presented in Fig. 1 have shown the metallic Cu0-phase (d-values of 2.09 x , 1.815 and 1.282; ICDD file No. 4-836) in the catalysts along with CuO and MgO phase. The crystallite size of Cu0 has been calculated by X-ray line broadening technique using Debye-Scherrer equation, D = kλ/β cos θ where k =0.9 and D corresponds to Cu-Crystallite size. It is observed that the Cu-crystallite size in the CMCr catalyst is lower compared to that in CM and Cu-1800P catalysts. This information clearly demonstrates the advantage of using tetra ethyl ammonium hydroxide to obtain more dispersed Cu or smaller particles of Cu."
8,Results of TPR analysis,"3.3 Results of TPR analysis Fig. 2 shows the TPR profiles of calcined catalysts of CMCr and Cu-1800P. A two stage reduction of CuO to Cu0 is observed in the CMCr catalyst and the Cu-1800P commercial catalyst seem to reduce in a single step at a T max of 459K which is lower compared to CMCr and Cu-MgO catalysts [12]. The standard CuO is found to reduce at a T max of 606K (profile not shown in the figure) in single stage attributed to the reduction of CuO to Cu0. Most of the oxidic copper in the CMCr catalyst is found to reduce at T max in the range of 523–563K. But, a complete reduction seems to occur at ∼673–713K. Thus, it appears that the reduction of CMCr sample takes place in two stages with the first peak corresponding to the transformation of CuO to Cu2O and the second H2 consumption peak corresponding to the reduction of Cu2O to Cu0. Our earlier [12] studies on TPR of the co-precipitated Cu-MgO catalyst have shown similar results. However, a shift in the T max of these two H2 consumption peaks to the higher temperature region can be seen from Cu-MgO to CMCr catalysts. This indicates that the incorporation of Cr2O3 enhances the dispersion and interaction of CuO with the support MgO. Agrell et al. [25] attributed the shifting in the reduction temperature in the TPR patterns of CuO-ZnO-Al2O3 catalysts to the formation of larger CuO crystallites and/or possibly to a strong interaction between copper and support. The reduction of commercial catalyst at lower temperatures compared to Cu-MgO can be explained on the same basis of strong interaction between CuO and Cr2O3. On the other hand the interaction of CuO with the support MgO in Cu-MgO catalyst & CMCr catalyst makes the reduction of CuO phase difficult. The low intense & broad signals centered at ∼855K can be ascribed to the reduction process of Cr2O3 [26]. Thus, it seems that though the ease of reducibility is higher in case of commercial catalyst, the higher dispersion of Cu in CM and CMCr as observed from the formation of smaller crystallites (XLB analysis) and a stronger synergistic interaction between Cu and MgO in these catalysts are probable reasons for their superior activity over Cu-1800P towards hydrogenation–dehydrogenation reactions in the present study. Chang et al attributed the copper species reducing at higher temperatures to smaller CuO particles with a certain degree of interaction with the chromium species used as the promoter in the copper supported on rice husk ash catalyst [27]. They further opined that the shift in the reduction peak to higher temperatures implying the existence of a phase composed of well-dispersed CuO particles surrounded by fine chromia particles with a certain degree of interaction thus interrupting the formation of large bulk CuO crystallites [27]."
9,XPS results,"3.4 XPS results The XPS patterns of reduced catalysts for Cu 2p and Cr 2p are shown in Figs. 3 and 4 , respectively. The corresponding characteristics of binding energy values of Cu 2p3/2, Mg 2p, O 1s, Cr 2p3/2 along with the Cu/Mg (in CM catalyst), Cu/(Mg+Cr) (in CMCr catalyst) and Cu/Cr (in Cu-1800P) atomic ratios and Cus/Cup (intensity ratio of the Cu 2p satellite peak to Cu 2p parent peak) are given in Table 2 . The higher Cus/Cup observed in case of CuO and CM samples probably indicate the presence of more Cu2+ or CuO species. The satellite peaks observed in case of Cu+2 compounds are due to the shake up transitions by ligand to metal 3d charge transfer [28]. These satellite peaks are not seen in Cu+ compounds or in metallic Cu because of completely filled 3d shells. In fact, transition metal ions with unfilled 3d orbital are well reported to show satellite peaks in the core level XP spectra due to electron shake-up and the structure of satellite, i.e., the peak number, intensity and splitting which reflect the nature of chemical bondings of the transition metal ions [29,30]. The concentration of Cu with respect to Mg (Cu/Mg) in CM catalyst is almost same as that with respect to (Mg+Cr) in CMCr catalysts. However, the intensity ratios of Cus/Cup indicate that CM catalyst contain more amount of Cu2+ than in CMCr catalyst. Thus, the role of Cr2O3 seems to stabilize the Cu0 species, which are responsible for the higher activity and selectivity towards furfuryl alcohol formation [1]. The Cu/Cr atomic ratio in Cu-1800P is much higher compared to the Cu surface contribution in other two catalysts. The XPS spectra of Cr 2p3/2 and Cr 2p1/2 are found to be in the range of 576.6–577.9eV and 586.4–587.5eV, respectively, indicating the presence of Cr3+ species status as Cr2O3 [24,31]. The O 1s spectra show the binding energy values in the range of 529.6–533.4eV for all the catalysts in the study that is characteristic of metal oxides and closer to O 1s binding energy in MgO. The Mg 2p binding energy values are almost the same in all the MgO containing samples."
10,Activity studies,"3.5 Activity studies The combination of furfural hydrogenation and cyclohexanol dehydrogenation has been carried out in vapor phase at atmospheric pressure. In order to understand the results of this combination reaction, the individual reactions of furfural hydrogenation and cyclohexanol dehydrogenation are also studied under similar conditions on the same three copper catalysts, viz., CM, CMCr and Cu-1800P in the temperature range of 453–523K. The steady state conversion value at a reaction run time of 6h has been taken for the sake of comparison in these reactions. 3.5.1 Hydrogenation of furfural Fig. 5 shows the activities of the copper catalysts studied for the hydrogenation of furfural in the temperature range of 453–523K. The figure clearly shows a steady increase in the conversion levels of furfural over all the catalysts with temperature. The selectivity towards the alcohol (furfuryl alcohol) however is getting reduced with increase in the reaction temperature on account of formation of the other side-products. The formation of side-products may be expected with the ring hydrogenation (CC hydrogenation) taking place at these temperatures [32]. Our previous results on the hydrogenation of FAL over Cu-MgO catalysts showed a similar trend [11]. Thus, 473K seems to be an optimum temperature yielding higher amounts of FOL over all the catalysts of the present study. Among all these catalysts, CMCr showed higher ability in yielding the desired product, FOL. Our previous study of hydrogenation of furfural over Cu-MgO catalysts clearly demonstrated the advantage of Cu-MgO co-precipitated catalyst, which has been found to possess more number of Cu0 species at the surface [12]. The presence of more Cu0 species has been attributed to the presence of defect sites of MgO which are reported to be more reactive and that the adsorption properties for metal species can be qualitatively different from those of regular surface sites [33–37]. It is also reported that the defect sites at the metal support interfacial region in case of Pt-TiO2 system are helpful to coordinate the oxygen atom of the CO group via lone pair of electrons and thus activate the hydrogenation of CO group [38]. However, in the present study we observed the presence of Cu2+ species along with Cu0 species in Cu-MgO catalyst at the surface as well as in the bulk. The different methodology adopted in CMCr catalyst preparation compared to CM catalyst preparation is to get highly dispersed smaller crystallites of more number of Cu0 rather than Cu2+ sites at the surface. 3.5.2 Dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol Dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol is known to be an equilibrium-controlled reaction [39]. Fig. 6 shows an increase in cyclohexanol dehydrogenation with rise in temperature over all the catalysts. The catalyst, CMCr exhibited highest yield of cyclohexanone, i.e., 67.3% at 523K. Cu-1800P, the commercial Cu catalyst however showed a decrease in the percentage selectivity to cyclohexanone with rise in temperature (>473K) because of formation of other products, viz., cyclohexene, phenol, etc., through the side-reactions such as dehydration taking place at the elevated temperatures over this catalyst. However, the selectivity towards cyclohexanone increases with reaction temperature over CM and CMCr catalysts. The large amount of Cr component in Cu-1800P might have induced acidity in the catalyst because of which dehydration of cyclohexanol finds its way in the reaction. 3.5.3 Coupling reaction Since above 473K the dehydration of cyclohexanol is significant in Cu-1800P, a reaction temperature of 473K has been chosen as optimum temperature for the comparison of activities of these catalysts in the coupling process. Fig. 7 shows the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation abilities in the coupling process of these catalysts against time on stream at 473K. CMCr catalyst exhibits a steady conversion (≥40% conversion of cyclohexanol and ∼85% conversion of furfural). On CM catalyst the dehydrogenation activity drops against time on stream and maintains a steady activity after 2h. This is reflected in the furfural hydrogenation. However, it is interesting to see that the initial conversion of cyclohexanol over Cu-1800P catalyst is very high (>50%). However, it dropped to half within 4h after which a steady activity is maintained. A similar trend is observed in furfural hydrogenation on this catalyst. The interesting observations one can draw from the coupling process are: (a) On Cu-1800P, the initial cyclohexanol conversion of >50% at 473K is clear above the equilibrium value. (b) The conversions (for both dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions) on all the catalysts in the coupling process are well above those in the independent reactions. It seems both furfural and cyclohexanol are competing each other to adsorb on the active sites. In the initial stages over CM and Cu-1800P catalysts, large number of both cyclohexanol and furfural might have adsorbed on the active sites. However, during the course of the reaction there may be a change in the active sites (may be a change in the oxidation state of Cu or agglomeration of Cu sites) on CM and Cu-1800P catalysts. After restructuring of active sites, stable activity in both dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions were observed. On the other hand a stable activity in both dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions were observed on CMCr catalyst. This is a clear indication that during the pretreatment of CMCr catalyst (reduction) active sites were developed, which is not the case with other two catalysts. Thus, the role of small amount of Cr species in CMCr catalyst is to get the required active sites during the reduction and to maintain the Cu particle size during the reaction. The catalytic activity of the CMCr catalyst towards the combination reaction of furfural hydrogenation and cyclohexanol dehydrogenation in the temperature range of 453–523K has been presented in Fig. 8 . A fall in conversion of furfural from 99.5% to 61% takes place with the increase in temperature from 453 to 523K whereas the conversion of cyclohexanol increased from 22% to 43%. The increase in the conversion of cyclohexanol with temperature can be expected since dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol is an endothermic reaction and rise in temperature shifts the equilibrium to the right favoring the forward reaction (dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone) [39]. Even though the increased conversion levels of cyclohexanol against temperature generates more amount of H2, furfural hydrogenation could not be proceeded as expected probably because most of the active Cu sites might have participated in the cyclohexanol dehydrogenation. However, it is interesting to observe that the selectivity to both FOL & cyclohexanone maintained a maximum (100%) at all the reaction temperatures although there is a fall in the conversion of FAL. Apparently the yields of FOL are also very high at all these temperatures with an optimum yield of 88% observed at 473K. This temperature is regarded as the optimum with high yields towards both FOL and cyclohexanone. The combination reaction is advantageous in producing enhanced yields of the desired products, viz., FOL and cyclohexanone when compared to the individual reactions. The results clearly indicate the advantageous role played by chromia in showing high activity towards FOL formation with 88% of FAL conversion. The activities of the catalysts are found to be in the order CMCr>CM>Cu-1800P. The chromia promoted Cu-MgO catalyst has shown higher activity compared to the unpromoted Cu-MgO and the commercial Cu-1800P catalysts. The reason may be attributed to the stabilization of surface Cu0 or Cu+ species by chromia as observed from the XPS results and the presence of smaller Cu particle size. Various reports [1,32,40,41] reveal the selective nature of Cu-based catalysts in the hydrogenation of CO bond in the side group leaving CC bonds intact in the furan ring. Rao et al. [42] made an extensive study and proposed a surface mechanism explaining the hydrogenation of furfural over copper chromite catalyst by a Langmuir-Hinshelwood model with a competitive adsorption between furfural and hydrogen either on one type of site or two different sites with each reactant on one site. They opine that Cu+ species are involved in the catalytic process and the presence of Cu0 sites is also required for activation of H2. Medvedeva et al. [43,44] have reported the presence of only Cu0 as the active sites in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol. However, in the kinetic studies reported by Fridman et al. [45] they suggested two different mechanisms, viz., one on Cu+ species over Cu-ZnO-Al2O3 catalysts and the other on Cu0 species over Cu-MgO catalysts. They suggested that cyclohexanol adsorption on zero valent copper sites is dissociative and proceeds by the rupture of the OH bond. The formation of adsorbed species of cyclohexanol alcoholate which acts, as an intermediate for the formation of cyclohexanone by the abstraction of the nonhydroxylic hydrogen is further found by them to be the rate determining step. Considering these mechanisms in the major reports and our observations in the present study of the combination of FAL hydrogenation and the cyclohexanol dehydrogenation, the following possible surface mechanism with these steps may be proposed. The first step (1) is a dissociative adsorption of cyclohexanol on metallic copper forming an alcoholate and hydrogen atom abstracted from the OH group maintains adsorbed state. The next step (2) is the removal of the α-hydrogen, which has been reported as the rate-determining step by Fridman et al. [45]. The successive step (4) and (5) are the interaction of furfural either in gas phase or in the adsorbed form on yet another active site (either Cu0 or Cu+). The formation of furfuryl alcohol and cyclohexanone then take place in independent steps (3) and (6). The adsorbed hydrogen (S–H) in step (1) and step (2) may get desorbed to give gas phase H2 that may then combine with the adsorbed furfural molecule to yield furfuryl alcohol. (1) S+C6H11OH(g) →S–C6H11O+S–H (2) S–C6H11O+S→S–C6H10O+S–H (3) S–C6H10O→C6H10 O(g) +S (4) S–H+C4H3OCHO(g) (orS1–C4H3OCHO)→S–C4H3OCH2O(orS1–C4H3OCH2O+S) (5) S–C4H3OCH2O+S–H(orS1–C4H3OCH2O)→S–C4H3OCH2OH+S(orS1–C4H3OCH2OH+S) (6) S–C4H3OCH2OH(orS1–C4H3OCH2OH)→C4H3OCH2OH(g) +S(orS1) where S=Cu0; S1 =Cu0/Cu+ However, further study is required in order to confirm the above mechanism. Thus, the advantages of the coupling process are mainly: (i) External hydrogen pumping can be avoided as in-situ generation of hydrogen from the dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol is utilized and thus seems to be an economical route in the synthesis of furfuryl alcohol from furfural. (ii) Furfural hydrogenation is an exothermic reaction with a ΔH =−52.32kcal/mol (Scheme 1 ). Whereas cyclohexanol dehydrogenation is an endothermic (ΔH =+15kcal/mol) and equilibrium constrained process (Scheme 2 ). Thus, apart from the effective utilization of the hydrogen evolved in the reaction (2), the combination of reactions (1)–(2) as reaction (3) gives a better thermal balance (ΔH =−37.32kcal/mol) through hydrogen transfer between the two reactants (Scheme 3 ). (iii) The foremost of all advantages is the achievement of enhanced yields of furfuryl alcohol and considerably good yields of cyclohexanone by employing the combination reaction. (iv) In contrast to the large amount of Cr-oxide in commercial catalyst, the lab made catalyst contains small amount of Cr-oxide. (v) A simple chromia promoted Cu-MgO catalyst prepared by coprecipitation method using tetra ethyl ammonium hydroxide as a precipitating agent, yields FOL in good amounts. (vi) The coupling route provides in-situ generation of H2 which helps in preventing the by-products, viz., tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, furan, methyl furan, etc., in the hydrogenation of FAL and thus high yields to FOL are maintained."
11,Conclusions,"A combination reaction of FAL hydrogenation and CyOH dehydrogenation over CMCr-P catalyst is found to be advantageous in eliminating the use of any external source of H2 and in enhancing the yields to desired products, viz., FOL and Cyone. The presence of Cr2O3 is responsible in stabilizing Cu0/Cu+ species required for both the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions as evidenced from XPS analysis & XRD results. Further, smaller crystallite size (XLB analysis) of Cu and stronger synergism between Cu and MgO (TPR) seem to be responsible for the higher activity of this catalyst."
