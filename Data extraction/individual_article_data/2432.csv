0,Introduction,"Worldwide awareness on climate changes due to emission of green house gases and rapidly depleting fossil fuel reserves has drawn attention of developed and industrialized countries to consider biofuels as an alternate source of energy [1]. Hydrogen (H2) has been considered as a future clean and secure energy carrier since its combustion process generates only pure water as by-product [2]. H2 also has the highest energy density (143 kJ/g) as compared to any known fuel. It can be produced from various organic wastes that are released in the environment, thus provide an added advantage of waste management. The demand on hydrogen is not limited to utilization as a source of energy but also as a feedstock for the production of chemicals, electronic devices, processing steel and also hydrogenation of fats and oils in food industry [3]. Dark fermentation and photobiology are widely known as the two main mechanisms for biohydrogen production [4]. Hallenbeck and Benemann [5] stated that dark fermentation process is simpler and more efficient than photobiological processes for biological H2 production. The dark fermentation at thermophilic temperatures (60 °C) has many attractive advantages as compared to mesophilic temperatures (37 °C). Many industrial organic wastewaters are discharged at elevated temperatures that can be directly used. Moreover, at higher temperature conditions this leads to pathogenic destruction, lower risk of contamination by methanogenic archaea, higher rate of hydrolysis and higher H2 yield [6–8]. In addition, during fermentation it generates excess heat that requires cooling for mesophilic cultures. Under the extreme-thermophilic temperatures of 70 °C, Kotsopoulos et al. obtained a yield of 2.4 mol/mol glucose by mixed culture fermentation in a UASB reactor [9]. For the above reasons, our present study focused on the improvement of fermentative H2 production process using enriched thermophilic hydrogen producing mixed culture. Development of thermophilic hydrogen producing mixed culture was done by suppressing methanogenic bacteria by performing the heat shock pre-treatment (HSP) and chemical treatment like BES (2-bromo ethane sulfonate) aided with controlling the pH at acidic level (5–6.5). The microbial community was investigated using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) [10,11]. Then, multiple parameters viz. temperature, substrate concentration and initial pH were optimized using Box–Behnken model and a surface response methodology is generated using MINITAB15 software [12,13]. Optimized parameters thus obtained were used to study the cumulative hydrogen production and modified Gompertz equation [14] was used to fit the cumulative hydrogen production curves to obtain the hydrogen production potential (P), the hydrogen production rate (R m) and lag phase (λ)."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Enrichment of thermophilic H2 producing microorganism,"2.1 Enrichment of thermophilic H2 producing microorganism The sludge was collected from an anaerobic digester of a distillery industry (IFB Agro, Kolkata). The enrichments were done in 100 mL anaerobic serum bottles with 70 mL of medium. Media used for enrichment consist of Na2HPO4 (4.2 g/L), KH2PO4 (1.5 g/L), NH4Cl (1.95 g/L), MgCl2 (0.18 g/L), yeast extract (2.0 g/L), glucose (10 g/L), cysteine HCl (1 g/L), vitamins solution (DSMZ medium No141, German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures). Methanogenic activity was suppressed using 40 mM of 2-bromo ethane sulfonate (BES). Under anaerobic condition, 5 g of the anaerobic sludge in the above media was sealed tightly by crimping. The sludge enriched bottles were then incubated at 60 °C for a week and observed for H2 production by gas chromatography (Agilent Technology U.S.A). The mixed cultures were enriched by repeated sub-culturing for a week to stabilize the mixed consortia."
3,Single parameter optimization,"2.2 Single parameter optimization From literature it was found that hydrogen production is a function of pH and substrate concentration [15]. Therefore single parameter optimization with respect to different initial pH, temperature and substrate concentration was done in 100 mL serum bottles containing 70 mL of media under strict anaerobic conditions."
4,Multiple parameter optimizations,"2.3 Multiple parameter optimizations For maximization of hydrogen production, the cumulative effect of three process parameters viz. temperature, pH and substrate concentration was studied by multi parameter optimization. The variables so chosen were temperature (X 1), substrate concentration (X 2) and pH (X 3) and the corresponding response variable measured was hydrogen production (Y). A three factor Box–Behnken design with 12 unique sets and a triplicate on the centre point was used and coded and actual levels of variables chosen for the statistical design of experiment are given in Table 1 . The independent variables were coded according to the following equation: (1) x i = X i − X i , mid Δ X i where x i represents the coded value of the ith independent variable, X i represents the uncoded value of the ith independent variable, X i,mid represents the uncoded value at the centre point for the ith independent variable and ΔX i represents the difference between any two consecutive point of the ith independent variable. Statistical software, MINITAB15 was used for modelling whereby the experimental data were fit into a second degree polynomial equation of the following form: (2) Y = C 1 + C 2 X 2 + C 3 X 2 + C 4 X 3 + C 5 X 1 2 + C 6 X 2 2 + C 7 X 3 2 + C 8 X 1 X 2 + C 9 X 2 X 3 + C 10 X 3 X 1 Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used to infer if there were any significant interactions between the chosen independent variables. 3D surface plots were generated using MINITAB15 to get a diagrammatic representation of the effect of the response variable on any two dependent variables. A simple genetic algorithm was used to develop a C code for the determination of the optimum process parameters. These optimized process parameters were expected to give the maximum hydrogen production assuming the response variables are related to independent variables by equation (2)."
5,Hydrogen production study with mixed culture under optimized process parameters,"2.4 Hydrogen production study with mixed culture under optimized process parameters Batch fermentation for hydrogen production under optimized parameters was performed in a double jacket reactor with working volume of 400 mL. The modified Gompertz equation (Equation (3)) was used to fit cumulative hydrogen production in the batch experiment performed under optimized process parameters. (3) H ( t ) = P exp { − exp [ R m × e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where H (t) is the cumulative hydrogen volume at time t (h) and was obtained by measuring accumulated hydrogen content from the fixed headspace volume at time t (h), P (mL H2) represents hydrogen potential and obtained during stationary phase, R m (mL H2/h) represents maximum hydrogen production rate and is obtained during exponential phase, and λ (h) represents lag time. The typical cumulative hydrogen production curve was nonlinearly modelled by the above equation. Parameters (P, R m and λ) were estimated using the solver function in Matlab (Curve fitting tool box ver. 1.1.7.) [16]."
6,Batch fermentation of rice spent wash using optimized process parameters,2.5 Batch fermentation of rice spent wash using optimized process parameters Rice spent wash obtained from distillery industry contains 8 g/L ± 0.99 g/L of reducing sugar and COD of 60 g/L ± 2.6 g/L. Rice spent wash was subjected to batch fermentation for hydrogen production under optimized process parameters of 2.4 and different initial COD [17]. Range of COD was varied from 30 g/L to 60 g/L. Batch fermentation were performed in 500 mL double jacketed reactor with working volume of 400 mL for 48 h.
7,Analyse,"2.6 Analyse All biogas components (H2, CH4, and CO2) were determined by gas chromatography (GC Agilent Technology 7890A U.S.A) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a stainless steel packed with Porapak Q (80/100). The operational temperatures of the injection port, the oven and the detector were 80 °C, 150 °C and 200 °C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 20 mL min−1. The VFAs and alcohols were determined using a gas chromatography (GC Agilent Technology 7890A U.S.A) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and stainless-steel capillary column coated with 10% PEG-20M and 2% H3PO4 (80/100 mesh). The temperature of the injection port, detector and programmed column were 220 °C, 240 °C, and 130–175 °C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 20 mL min−1. The mixture of hydrogen and air at a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 was used for flame generation."
8,"PCR-DGGE, DNA cloning and sequencing","2.7 PCR-DGGE, DNA cloning and sequencing The enriched thermophilic cultures were sampled for microbial community analysis. Genomic DNA of the mixed culture was extracted using Ultra Clean Soil DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio). The extracted DNA was stored in 30 μl TE (Tris HCl EDTA) solution of pH 8.0 at −20 °C. PCR was performed by amplifying a region of 200 bp of 16S rRNA genes from extracted DNA using Eubacteria primer pairs 314F with GC clamp (5′GC-clamp-CCAAGGAAGGCAGCAGGC-3′) and 518R (5′ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG-3′). The PCR condition was performed using an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 3 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 3 min, and final extension step at 72 °C, 10 min using Thermal Cycler Eppendorf USA. Bacterial community structure was analysed by DGGE using a D-Code system, BIORAD Laboratories, USA. The PCR samples were loaded onto 8%(w/v) polyacrylamide gel in 1 × TAE pH 7.5. Polyacrylamide gels were prepared with a 20–50% gradient of denaturant (7 M urea and 40% deionised formamide). The electrophoresis was run at 60 °C, for 3 h at 200 V. After the electrophoresis, the gels were stained for 45 min in EtBr (ethidium bromide) and observed under UV light. The DNA fragment to be sequenced was excised out from the gel with sterile blade, placed in sterilized vials. DNA from these bands was eluted by adding 20 μl of sterile water and keeping it at 4 °C overnight. 10 μl of the eluate was used as template DNA in PCR, using the primers (no GC clamp314F and 518R) and conditions described above. PCR products were cloned in pBSK vector and sequenced in commercial facility (Bangalore Genei, Bangalore India). The sequence were aligned to 16S rRNA sequences obtained from the database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using a BLAST search and phylogenetic tree was plotted by using MEGA4 software."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Enriched thermophilic mixed culture,"3.1 Enriched thermophilic mixed culture The mixed culture was developed by repetitive sub-culturing for a week. The mixed culture mainly consists of long rod shaped microorganisms capable of growing at thermophilic range of temperatures. This mixed culture was capable of producing hydrogen from various types of carbon sources (glucose, sucrose, l-arabinose, d-xylose, d-cellobiose and starch) as shown in Table 2 . This shows that the mixed culture has a broad spectrum of enzymatic machinery that helps in utilizing complex carbon sources like cellobiose and starch."
11,Optimization of hydrogen production in batch fermentation,"3.2 Optimization of hydrogen production in batch fermentation Single parameter optimization with respect to process parameters (pH, substrate concentration and temperature) was done using thermophilic enriched mixed culture. Effect of initial pH was investigated at various initial pH of 4.5–8.5 with an increment of 0.50. Fermentation was conducted at 60 °C and with fixed glucose concentration of 8 g/L. Hydrogen production increased as the initial pH range increased from pH 4.5 to 6.5 and then subsequently decreases with further increase in initial pH (Fig. 1 ). Maximum hydrogen yield of 1.98 mol/mol of glucose was obtained at the initial pH of 6.5. An extreme range of pH inhibits hydrogen production because the activity of Fe–Fe hydrogenase could be inhibited [18]. Influence of initial substrate (glucose) concentration was investigated at various concentrations of 6 g/L to 14 g/L with an increment of 2 g/L. Fermentation was conducted at 60 °C and optimized pH of 6.5. Hydrogen production increased as the initial glucose concentration was increased from 6 g/L to 10 g/L and subsequently decreased with further increase in glucose concentration. Maximum hydrogen yield of 2.2 mol/mol of glucose was observed at 10 g/L glucose concentration. However hydrogen production decreased at glucose concentration beyond 10 g/L; which may be due to substrate inhibition. Similarly, role of initial temperature was investigated at various initial temperatures of 30 °C–80 °C with an increment of 10 °C. Hydrogen production was observed from 50 °C to 70 °C (Fig. 3). Hydrogen production was not observed at ambient temperature ranges i.e. at 30 °C and 40 °C. This indicates the presence of thermophilic microorganisms in consortia. Temperature greater than 70 °C results in denaturation of enzymatic machinery (ferredoxin oxidroreductase, phosphate acetyltransferase, acetate kinase and hydrogenase) present in these fermentative microorganisms [19,20]."
12,Maximization of hydrogen production by multi parameter optimization,"3.3 Maximization of hydrogen production by multi parameter optimization The optimized process parameters obtained from single parameter optimization helped in designing experiment for multi parameter optimization by a three factor Box–Behnken design. Effect on hydrogen production by significant independent variables (temperature, pH and substrate concentration) was explored using Box–Behnken design. Table 3 represents the design of matrix and experimental results. 12 unique sets of experiments and a triplicate on the centre point were performed. Temperature was varied from 50 °C to 70 °C in steps of 10 °C, substrate concentration was varied from 6 g/L to 14 g/L in steps of 4 g/L and pH was varied from 5.5 to 7.5 in steps of 1 unit and hydrogen production was observed. Above ranges were considered on the basis of single parameter optimization studies whose results were not shown here. The theoretical model generated upon training the experimental data is as follows: (4) Y = − 68000.9 + 1615 X 1 + 859.077 X 2 + 6054.76 X 3 − 12.8155 X 1 2 − 45.4985 X 2 2 − 452.976 X 3 2 − 4.10714 X 1 X 2 + 55.3571 X 2 X 3 − 11.0714 X 3 X 1 Regression analysis gave an R 2 value of 0.98 indicating that the model fails to explain less than 2% of the variations observed. ANOVA for the response variable revealed 9 degrees of freedom and 5 error degrees of freedom. Fischer variance ratio (F) was found to be 32.50 which is greater than F 0.05,9,5 = 4.772 (significance level: α = 0.05) which indicates data obtained is highly significant. Using the Minitab software, the response surface curves described by the regression model were constructed (Fig. 2 ). In these figures, each response surface plot represents the effect of two independent variables on hydrogen production. The response surface plot based on independent variables i.e. glucose concentration and temperature on hydrogen production was shown in Fig. 2a. A significant increase in hydrogen production could be achieved by increasing substrate concentration from 6 g/L to 10 g/L. Beyond this level there was decrease in hydrogen production, suggesting that substrate inhibition might have occurred. Similarly, a significant increase in hydrogen production was observed in a range of 50 °C–60 °C. But further increase in temperature to 70 °C decreases hydrogen production, suggesting that further increment in temperature from 60 °C may be beyond the optimum temperature required for growth these organisms. Result obtained in Fig. 2b shows the response curve with respect to glucose and pH on hydrogen production. A significant increase in hydrogen production had been achieved by increasing pH from 5.5 to 6.5 but hydrogen production decreases when pH is further increased to 7.5, suggesting that this mixed culture grows optimally at pH 6.5. Thus fermentation media with initial pH 6.5 would facilitate optimum growth and hydrogen production. It was observed that the addition of glucose had a relatively greater effect on hydrogen production compared with the effect of pH. The response curve of pH and temperature on hydrogen production was shown in Fig. 2c. It shows that there was an increase in hydrogen production at pH 6.5 and temperature 60 °C which further decreased in other combinations. At pH 5.5 and temperature 70 °C there was a drastic decrease in hydrogen production suggesting these conditions might be adverse for the growth of the mixed culture. Thus optimized value of process parameters i.e. substrate (glucose) concentration, pH and temperature came out to be 10 g/L, pH 6.5 and 60 °C respectively with maximum hydrogen production of 3985 mL/L and yield of 2.7 mol/mol of glucose. The mathematical model given by equation (4) gave the maximum point of the model at 3897 mL/L corresponding to substrate (glucose) concentration of 10.8 g/L, pH 6.6 and 58.4 °C. Thus the theoretical value came concurrent with the experimental values. Hydrogen production increased by 22% as compared to single parameter optimization. The cumulative effect of process parameters i.e. glucose concentration, pH and temperature in multi parameter optimization gave an increased hydrogen yield as compared to single parameter optimization."
13,Hydrogen production analysis using Gompertz equation,"3.4 Hydrogen production analysis using Gompertz equation Hydrogen production under optimized parameters obtained multi parameter optimization gave maximum hydrogen production rate (R m) of 850 mL/h, gas production potential (P) of 4551 mL/L and lag time (λ) of 1.97 h was estimated from the curve fitting to modified Gompertz equation shown in Fig. 3 . While hydrogen yields of 2.7 mol/mol glucose was observed. In Table 4 , a comparison regarding various hydrogen yields reported in literature using thermophilic mixed culture was done. In the present study, a yield of 2.7 mol/mol of glucose has been found to be comparable with the earlier study done under extreme thermophilic temperatures of 70 °C obtained a yield of 2.4 mol/mol glucose by mixed culture fermentation in a UASB reactor [9]."
14,Hydrogen production from the rice spent wash,"3.5 Hydrogen production from the rice spent wash The optimum conditions were used in practice to produce hydrogen from residual sugar present in rice spent wash. Table 5 summarizes the kinetic parameters lag time (λ), maximum hydrogen production rate (R m) and gas production potential (P) at pH 6.5 and temperature 60 °C. It has been observed that the lag time was sensitive to the initial COD (chemical oxygen demand). Lag time decreases from 33 h at 30 g/L COD to 12 h at 60 g/L. This could be due to availability of more fermentable sugars with increase in the initial COD. Hydrogen production started at 4 h after fermentation began. The hydrogen yield of 464 mL/g carbohydrate and hydrogen production rate of 168 mL/L h were achieved. Hydrogen production ceased after 48 h of fermentation. This could be due to decrease in pH as there was accumulation of volatile fatty acids in the fermentation broth. Amount of fermentable sugar also decreases at the end of fermentation. COD removal of 60% was also observed (Fig. 4 ). Thus thermophilic dark fermentation has potential in treating high COD wastes like rice spent wash. The HY obtained from the rice spent wash was low in comparison to hydrogen production from sugar. This might be due to the presence of some toxic compounds such as ethanol (0.73 g/L) and other metabolites, which inhibit the fermentation process and bacterial growth. The concentration of acetic and butyric acids revealed that the fermentation process of rice spent wash by the mixed culture was of the acetate–butyrate fermentation type."
15,Microbial community analysis under thermophilic conditions,"3.6 Microbial community analysis under thermophilic conditions Microbial community profile of the batch culture operating at the optimized parameters i.e. 10 g/L glucose concentration, pH 6.5 and temperature 60 °C was studied by DGGE. Patterns of PCR products were obtained using eubacteria primer pairs 314F with GC-clamp and 518R. Amplified 204 bp PCR product corresponds to V3 region of the 16S rRNA which help in identifying the respective microbes in the given population. The bacterial communities in the mixed culture were analysed by a PCR-DGGE analysis targeted at eubacterial 16S rDNA (Fig. 5 a). The major bands in the DGGE gels (band A, B, C and D) were excised, eluted, cloned and sequenced commercially. Band A, B, C and D on sequencing shows 99% similarity with Thermoanerobacterium sp. Phylogenetic tree was plotted by MEGA4 programme and phylogenetic tree being shown in Fig. 5b. The tree based on Jukes–Cantor distance was constructed using neighbour-joining algorithm with 1000 bootstrapping. Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. DH10B is taken as out group. The scale bar represents 0.1 substitutions per nucleotide position. Numbers at the nodes are the bootstrap values. Band A showed 99% similarity with Thermoanerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum KKU 19, whereas bands B, C and D showed 97% similarity with Thermoanerobacterium aeotearoenes ZW-NZ613 and Thermoanerobacterium xylanolyticum DSM 7097. These microbes have potential to produce hydrogen. Band sequences determined in this study have been deposited in the NCBI database under accession numbers JQ997158–JQ997161."
16,Conclusions,"An enriched thermophilic mixed culture was developed from the raw sludge by various physical and chemical treatments that suppress the activity of methanogens. A statistical methodology was employed for multi parameter optimization for improvement of hydrogen production using this mixed culture. Box–Behnken design was adopted to screen the key process parameters and identify optimal values that contribute maximum hydrogen production. The results suggested that the statistical experimental design is an effective tool for optimization of process parameters on biohydrogen production. Experimental results show that substrate concentration, pH and temperature had significant influence on hydrogen production. Under optimized condition 2.7 mol of hydrogen/mol of glucose was achieved which is higher than the reported value on UASB. This shows that the thermophilic mixed culture used in this study possessed high potential of hydrogen production under optimal condition. Microbial community profile showed presence of Thermoanaerobacterium sp. which was capable of producing hydrogen at 60 °C. Also demonstrated the ability to use the mixed sugars present in the rice spent wash to produce hydrogen but with a lower HY. Future studies should aim to utilize this mixed culture to produce hydrogen from complex wastewater so that hydrogen production could be made cost effective."
