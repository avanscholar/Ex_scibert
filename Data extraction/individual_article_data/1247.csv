0,Introduction,"The production of hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) gas by catalytic water splitting under solar light irradiation would pave a sustainable way to clean energy technologies. Thus, the development of an efficient, stable, economic, and eco-friendly catalyst is of vital importance. Several reports in the literature have demonstrated a high rate of H2 generation using catalysts with improved surface-interface properties that are able to absorb and utilize UV or visible light [1,2]. The development of nanoscale materials has opened-up new research avenues based on their smaller size and diverse morphologies [3,4]. One-dimensional (1D) nanostructures exhibit attractive physico-chemical properties such as enhanced adsorption of the reactant on the surface, reduced agglomeration in aqueous suspension, improved light absorption from all angles of incidence, one dimensional transfer of charge carriers to the surface, and suppressed electron–hole recombination. The design and fabrication of the advanced nano-size photocatalysts and their applications for the H2 production have been recently reviewed by Tong et al. [5]. 1D nanostructures such as nanotubes, nanorods and nanobelts have demonstrated enhanced light conversion efficiency and good catalytic properties. In contrast to the nanoparticles, nanotubes exhibit a smaller number of intercrystalline contacts and crystal defects, and a larger amount of atoms exposed to the surface [6,7]. Generally, the nanosized catalysts show a great enhancement of the H2 production rate by water splitting due to their numerous edges which possess high energy potentials, the large amount of surface active sites, and the short-distance to surface for the excited charge carriers as compared to bulk materials [8,9]. A few reports demonstrated the higher photocatalytic activity of nanosized photocatalysts to their improved surface and electrical properties, as well as to the size-dependent effects [10,11]. Among other catalysts, TiO2 nanostructures have been comprehensively studied for various applications [12,13]. In particular, Ti-based photocatalysts containing copper in different states (Cuo, Cu2O and CuO) have displayed improved catalytic efficiency due to a better absorption of visible light and enhanced suppression of electron–hole recombination at the surface [14–19]. The photocatalysts that absorb a portion of UV and visible light of the solar spectrum generate plenty of charge carriers with different mobilities to carry out oxidation–reduction reactions at catalyst surface, which in-turn enhance the overall H2 production efficiency. In this regard, numerous investigations have already demonstrated that Cu-modified TiO2 nanoparticles, nanotubes and nanorods can significantly enhance the rate of the H2 production using different sacrificial reagents under visible light irradiation [20–24]. For example, Lalitha and co-workers reported [16] that finely dispersed Cu2O on TiO2 (P-25) showed a significantly enhanced photocatalytic H2 production under solar light. Size-dependent photocatalytic activity of Cu2O nanocrystals on TiO2 (P-25) catalysts under the simulated solar irradiation was reported by Li et al. [24]. The amount of copper and the temperature of calcination greatly influenced the nature of copper species in the nanostructured catalyst (Cu x O/TiO2), which showed an improved activity for the H2 production as described by Jung et al. [23]. The structural properties of CuO/TiO2 nanorod catalyst under solar light irradiation were studied in detail by Khemthong et al. [22]. We have recently found that well dispersed suspension of CuO/TiO2 nanotubes in aqueous glycerol solution exhibits a rate of H2 production of about 99.8mmolh−1 g−1 cat [15]. Based on our earlier report, an amount of 5mg of the catalyst (CuO/TiO2 nanotubes) dispersed in 50mL aqueous glycerol solution showed the best performance. We have also found that CuO species effectively captures electrons at the Schottky barrier, facilitating the charge separation and electron transfer that leads to the enhancement of the H2 production. Herein, we report on the detailed investigation of Cu-modified TiO2 nanostructures on photocatalytic properties and H2 production activity. The crystal structure, morphology, surface area, optical absorption, and charge carrier dynamics are discussed. The effects of mono- and di-hydroxylic alcohols as hole scavengers and the optimization of other reaction parameters, namely copper loading and ethylene glycol concentrations, are also highlighted. The present study demonstrates that Cu x O/TiO2 nanostructures can be utilised as a highly efficient photocatalyst for H2 production under solar light irradiation."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials and reagents,"2.1 Materials and reagents Photocatalyst grade titanium dioxide (TiO2 P-25) composed of anatase 80 % and rutile 20% was procured from Degussa Corporation, Germany. Titanium dioxide (anatase 99%, TiO2, LAB) was purchased from Merck, India. Analytical reagent (A.R) grade chemicals of sodium hydroxide pellets (97%), copper nitrate tri hydrate (99%), hydrochloric acid (37%), methanol (99.8%), ethanol (99.9%), propanol (99.5%) and ethylene glycol (99%) were supplied by Merck, India and used without any further purification. De-ionized water (100%, battery grade) used for synthesis, impregnation process and photocatalytic experiments was procured from LIMRA, Kadapa, India."
3,Preparation of the photocatalysts,"2.2 Preparation of the photocatalysts The hydrogen trititanate (H2Ti3O7) nanotubes were synthesized by the hydrothermal method described elsewhere [15]. In a typical synthesis, 2.5g of anatase TiO2 particles (hereafter denoted as TP) were dispersed in 200mL of aqueous 10M sodium hydroxide solution and heated at 130°C for 20h in a Teflon-lined autoclave (capacity 250mL). The obtained product was suspended in de-ionized water for 1h, followed by washing with 0.1M HCl solution and ethanol. The washing procedure was repeated two times. Finally, the catalyst was dried at 80 oC for 12h. This resulting product is denoted as pTNT. In its turn, a part of pTNT was placed in a ceramic boat and calcined at 350°C for 5h at heating rate of 2°Cmin−1. The resulting catalyst is denoted as TNT. The TiO2 catalysts doped with copper were prepared by impregnation method as already described in our previous paper [18]. In a typical preparation, 0.5g of TiO2 catalysts (TNP, pTNT and TNT) were suspended with copper nitrate dissolved in 10mL of distilled water and placed in 50mL glass beaker. The resulting mixture was magnetically stirred for 2h at 100°C (±5°C) for solvent evaporation. Then, the powder was crushed with a mortar and calcined at 350 oC for 5h in order to obtain the final form of the photocatalyst, denoted as Cu y O–TNP (Cu1.5TNP), Cu y O–pTNT (Cu1.5pTNT) and CuyO-TNT (Cu0.5TNT, Cu1.0TNT, Cu1.5TNT, Cu2.0TNT), depending on the copper amount. A commercial TiO2 powder (TNP) from Degussa P-25 was used as a reference material. Prior to hydrogen production, all powders were dried at 80°C for 16h."
4,Characterization of the photocatalysts,"2.3 Characterization of the photocatalysts All studied catalysts were characterized by using various analytical techniques. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were recorded using a D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer (Bruker), with λ CuKα=1.54056Å. Raman spectra were recorded with a Renishaw spectrometer (Nanonics multiview 2000) operating with an excitation wavelength of 532nm and power of 1mW. Diffuse Reflectance (DR) UV-Visible spectra were collected on a GBC UV-visible Cintra 10e spectrometer with wavelength range of 200–800nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were carried out by using a FEI Tecnai F20ST electron microscope operated at 200keV, equipped with high angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer. For the TEM measurements, all samples were sonicated in ethanol and the resulting dispersions were transferred onto holey carbon coated copper grids (200 mesh). Specific surface area (SSA), speciﬁc pore volume and average pore diameter were calculated from N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms recorded at 77K using a surface area analyzer, Micromeritics ASAP 2020. Prior to measurements, all samples were outgassed at 150°C under vacuum (10-3 mbar) for 6h. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was utilized to calculate the SSA, while the pore size distributions were derived from the desorption branches of the isotherms based on the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a KRATOS AXIS 165 equipped with MgKα radiation and hemispherical analyzer Phoibos 150 with 3D DLD detector (SPECS). The binding energy was referenced to the carbon K-edge (C 1s) at 284.8eV. Elemental analysis of the sample was carried out using a Horiba 8121-H energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX) detector. Photoluminescence spectra of the catalysts were recorded by a FLUORA MAX 4P spectrofluorometer at excitation wavelength of 320nm."
5,Photocatalytic hydrogen production under solar light irradiation,"2.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen production under solar light irradiation The photocatalytic activity tests were carried out in a quartz reactor equipped with a top loading port, sealed with a gas tight rubber septum. The same port was used for outgassing and sampling. Typically, 5mg of catalyst was dispersed in 50mL of 5vol% aqueous ethanol solution and stirred for 30 minutes in the absence of light. The gases present in the free space of the quartz reactor and dissolved in the reaction solution were removed by evacuating the reactor followed by purging with dry nitrogen to obtain an inert atmosphere. The photocatalytic activity experiments were performed under natural solar light irradiation with an average light intensity of 1.15×105 lx while the test solution was stirred continuously. The generated H2 gas was collected hourly and analyzed by using an off-line Shimadzu GC-2014 Gas Chromatograph (GC), equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and Molecular Sieve/5A column, at 70°C using N2 as the carrier gas. The control and the blank (without catalyst) experiments were carried out under identical conditions. In order to check the reproducibility, three sets of experiments were carried out in parallel. The recyclability study was also carried out 3 times in order to determine the stability of the photocatalyst. Each test was carried out as described above for 4 hours under natural solar light irradiation. After each test was completed, the reactor was kept overnight in the absence of light at room temperature, then the gaseous products were evacuated from the reactor, and the reactor was purged with dry nitrogen."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Fig. 1(a) shows XRD analysis of pristine (pTNT inset), calcined (TNT) and Cu-impregnated (Cu1.5TNT) nanostructured photocatalysts. The pTNT exhibits characteristic diffraction peak at 2θ=10.2° (001) which indicates the presence of layered crystal structure. All other peaks centered at 2θ=24.1° (202), 28.3° (112), and 48.2° (303) can be ascribed to the monoclinic H2Ti3O7 structure (JCPDS No. 47-0561). In the XRD patterns of TNT and Cu1.5TNT catalysts, the characteristic peak of pTNT disappears and two new peaks at 2θ=25.4° (101) and 27.5° (110) arise, demonstrating the presence of biphasic anatase and rutile TiO2 with tetragonal crystal structures (JCPDS Nos. 21-1272 and 21-1276). These findings are consistent with earlier reports that the transformation of H2Ti3O7 into TiO2 anatase phase occurs upon the calcination at above 300°C [15] and successive phase transitions of different TiO2 nanostructures are observed at the calcination temperatures from 300°C to 900°C [18–26]. The presence of copper in the photocatalysts was confirmed by EDAX analysis as shown in Fig. 1(b). One can see that XRD patterns of TNT and Cu1.5TNT are similar and no peaks corresponding to metallic copper or any copper oxides are observed. This implies that copper doping does not alter the crystal structure and crystallite size of the TiO2 nanoobjects, and it is uniformly distributed on the surface of Cu1.5TNT catalyst. This is also in compliance with earlier works which reported similar results for the TiO2 doped with up to 5wt% Cu [2,15,16,18,27,28]. Raman spectra of pTNT (inset), TNT and Cu1.5TNT photocatalysts are depicted in Fig. 2. The Eg peak is mainly caused by the symmetric stretching vibration of O–Ti–O linkage in TiO2, the B1g peak is assigned to symmetric bending vibration of O–Ti–O and the A1g peak is associated with anti-symmetric bending vibration of O−Ti−O linkage. As reported by Tian et al. [29], the Eg bands at 144 and 636cm−1, B1g peak at 394cm-1 and the A1g peak at 514cm−1 were observed for the prepared catalysts and several well-defined bands at 144, 196, 393, 512 and 635cm−1 for TiO2 anatase and rutile [30] were confirmed by the Raman spectroscopy as shown in Fig. 2. The inset picture displaying of the pTNT catalyst with bands at 146, 268 and 450cm−1 are associated with the H2Ti3O7 species [31]. In the case of Cu1.5TNT, Raman shift values are also similar to that of the TNT but the slight shifting of bonds were observed and it is ascribed to the presence of surface interacted copper species. This result is in compliance with the XRD and XPS data. The characterization of absorption threshold of photocatalysts was done by using UV–visible DRS spectrophotometer. The DR UV–vis spectra of pTNT, TNT and CuyTNT photocatalysts are displayed in Fig. 3(a). One can clearly see from Fig. 3(b) that pTNT displays an intense UV–vis absorption band below 400nm which is due to the hollow tubular morphology of H2Ti3O7 [2]. The absorption spectrum of TNT is slightly red-shifted as compared to the pTNT owing to its biphasic anatase-rutile structure. The copper impregnated catalyst appears to be pale blue in color and shows an extended absorption shift towards to the visible region ranging from 400nm to 550nm, which is due to Cu x O nanoclusters interacting with the TiO2 nanotubes [15]. It was also observed that optical absorption increases with the increase of copper loading from 0.5 to 2.5wt%. The Kubelka-Munk function versus the band gap energy (Eg=1240/λ) is calculated and are listed in Table 1. These results reveal that the catalysts are able to absorb solar light wavelength from 350nm to 450nm. The observation of the shift of the absorption edge is due to the change of the crystal structure and the presence of copper species as has been already reported [18]. TEM was employed to investigate the structure of the pristine and modified catalysts. The morphologies of pTNT, TNT and Cu1.5TNT catalysts are shown in Fig. 4. The pTNT catalyst exhibited 1-D nanotubular structure with open ends (hollow tube). The TEM images of Fig. 4(a) and (b) demonstrates that nanotubes consist of 3 to 5 layers wrapped nanosheets with outer diameter of 8–12nm. The length of tubes ranges from 100 to 200nm. The SAED pattern (Fig. 4(c)) confirms hydrogen trititanate structure. Fig. 4(d), (e), (g), and (h) shows that the calcination results in the destruction of tubular shape of TNT. Some tubes are still observed but the catalysts consist mainly of nanoparticles. Similar observations have also been reported in the literature [25,26,15]. The SAED patterns of TNT and Cu1.5TNT depicted in Fig. 4(f) and (i), respectively, confirm the biphasic anatase-rutile structure of samples. The absence of Cu or CuO particles at the surface of the catalyst demonstrates the fine dispersion of the copper species. Fig. 5 shows nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and corresponding pore-size distribution values derived from the BJH model. All three catalysts studied here exhibit the hysteresis loops at relatively low pressure P/P 0≥0.8 which indicates the presence of the nanotubular structures [32,33]. The pore-size distribution values showed that the diameters of the nanopores are in the narrow range of 15 to 25nm. The BET surface area, pore volume and average pore diameter of all the catalysts are listed in Table 1. The surface area and pore volume of the catalyst is decreasing in the following order: pTNT>TNT>Cu1.5TNT. The surface area of titanium dioxide (TP) powder is around 5.1m2 g−1 which while the BET surface area of prepared pTNT is about 282m2 g−1 , which is ~56 times higher. Upon the calcination at 350°C the surface area of TNT and Cu1.5TNT decreased to around 186 and 98m2 g−1, respectively. The decrease of the surface area is in agreement with observed structural transformations (Fig. 4) and previous data [2,22,33]. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized to analyze the chemical composition of surface of catalysts. Fig. 6 depicts the XPS spectra of pTNT, TNT and Cu1.5TNT catalysts. The XPS spectrum of Cu1.5TNT catalyst confirms the presence of copper in the nanocomposite catalyst and Cu 2p spectra show the doublet peaks located at binding energy (BE) values 932.15 and 952.4eV, which corresponds to +1 and 0 oxidation state of copper [19]. The Ti 2p XPS spectrum shows similar spectrum for all three catalysts. It can be clearly seen that two well resolved BE values at 459.3 and 464.9eV are observed from the Ti 2p core-level spectrum, which can be assigned to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 spin orbital components in TiO2, respectively [34]. The O1s spectra displayed BE values of pTNT at 530.7eV, whereas BE value of 530.5eV observed for TNT and Cu1.5TNT. These BE values were slightly shifted which may be attributed to change in crystal structure i.e. monoclinic (trititanate) into tetragonal crystal structure (anatase-rutile). Photoluminescence (PL) analysis was used in order to estimate the life time of charge carriers on the semiconductor surfaces during the photocatalytic process. Fig. 7 shows PL spectra of pTNT, TNT and Cu1.5TNT measured in the wavelength range of 350–550nm. Seven main PL emission peaks are observed at the same positions but having different intensity. Two major emission peaks at about 398nm and 419nm are assigned to anatase and rutile, respectively. The emission peaks at 438nm, 450nm and 468nm are attributed to band edge free excitons [35, 36]. The peak intensities for TNT and Cu1.5TNT are much lower than for pTNT due to the improved crystallinity after heat treatment process. Due to the electron scavenging role of Cuo at the surface of TNT the charge carrier life time is shorter. Thus, they have less chance to reach the surface and it retards the rate of recombination."
8,Solar photocatalytic hydrogen production,"3.2 Solar photocatalytic hydrogen production In the present study, we have adopted similar optimised experimental conditions as already described in our previous study [15]. Thus, 5mg of catalyst (Cu1.5TNT) was suspended in 50mL of 5vol% of aqueous-alcohol solution under the natural solar light irradiation. For the purpose of comparison, the mono-hydroxylic alcohols with the carbon (C1–C3) chain length and of the di-hydroxylic alcohol i.e. ethylene glycol were used as hole scavenger in order to know their effect on the rate of photocatalytic H2 production ( Fig. 8). The mono-hydroxylic alcohols exhibited increasing in rate of H2 production in the following order propanol>ethanol>methanol . These mono-hydroxylic alcohols are having different polarity which strongly influences the surface properties of the photocatalyst and followed by the adsorption and electron donation properties as previously reported [37]. The enhancement of the H2 production rate correlates with the increase in polarity of the alcohols which are in the following order propanol<ethanol<methanol. The effect of alcohols and carbohydrates as hole scavenger for the photocatalytic H2 production was reported [17,38,39]. Sreethawong et al. [40] explained that the decreases in the rate of H2 production using C1–C4 alcohols are due to the steric hindrance of the higher in the carbon number of alcohol moieties. In addition to this observation, it was reported that the fast mobility of methanol in the reaction medium plays a key role in the H2 production activity enhancement [41]. Furthermore, the experimental results reveal that ethylene glycol (di-hydroxylic alcohol) delivered drastic enhancement in the rate of the H2 production as compared to that of the mono-hydroxylic alcohols. In the present study, the enhancement in rate of the H2 production over photocatalyst (Cu1.5TNT) using aqueous ethylene glycol is ascribed to the following reasons: (i) the co-existence of both copper and copper oxide (Cu0, Cu1) on surface of the TiO2 catalyst facilitates the harvesting of solar light; (ii) oxidative valence band potential of titania is greater than that of the oxidation potential of ethylene glycol and therefore oxidation is feasible thermodynamically and the ethylene glycol readily oxidises, and (iii) the electrons that are generated in the conduction band of the semiconductor during process of the illuminated conditions which are effectively utilised in reduction of the protons to generate the molecular H2 gas. Bowker et al. [42] studied the beneficial role of organic scavengers in photocatalytic H2 production and found that hydroxyl groups present in the alcohol showed beneficial effect for H2 production. The results are in good agreement with the earlier reports [43]. Fig. 9 displays the amount of the H2 production versus the irradiation time using Cu x O-modified TNT photocatalyst in aqueous ethylene glycol solution. The amount of Cu in CuxO-modified TNT catalysts is varied from 0.5 to 2.0wt%. The catalysts display an astonishingly high rate of the H2 generation compared to TNT catalyst. The presence of CuxO in the catalyst is triggered the higher rate of H2 production and H2 production rate increases with increasing the amount of copper loading and then it decreased beyond the optimum level i.e. 1.5wt% of copper in Cu1.5TNT catalyst. At optimized conditions, the rate of H2 production is found to be 79.8mmolh−1 g−1 cat over Cu1.5TNT (1.5wt. % of copper) catalyst. The profound photocatalytic activity at the optimized conditions was attributed to the fine dispersion of Cu0 nanoclusters and resultant conduction band potential whose value (resultant conduction band potential) is quite below the conduction band potential of TiO2 nanostructures (tubes, rods and particles). At the lower Cu-loading (0.5 and 1.0wt% of copper), less H2 production activity was observed due to the less number of the catalytic active sites. Besides, the above optimum level (2.0wt% of copper and above), agglomeration of Cu0, Cu2O nanoclusters is observed as evidenced by spectral techniques and it tends to form the nanoparticles that led to the mismatch of the band potential suitable for the reduction of the protons, which intern results to obtain lower in the catalytic rate of H2 production. In the present study, the observed results are in the compliance with the earlier reports under solar or visible light irradiation, and the reports reveal that the higher copper loading can lead to increase in the particle size and it affects the optical properties of the catalysts and hence it showed less activity [15,16,44]. The co-catalyst behavior of the CuO–TiO2 photocatalyst was explained by Yu et al. [45]. They found that the amount of H2 production was diminished at above optimum loading of CuO and increase in the particle size of CuO at above optimal loading of 9wt% of the copper in CuO–TiO2 catalyst could led to decrease in the band gap, which resulted drastic decrease in rate of H2 production. The alcohol concentration in the aqueous solution is known to alter both the solution and the surface properties of the catalysts. Hence, in the present study, the effect of ethylene glycol was investigated with different concentration from 5 to 20vol% and the results are depicted in Fig. 10. The increase in the rate of H2 production was observed with increase in ethylene glycol concentration and the highest H2 production activity was about 114.9±5mmolh−1 g−1 cat recorded with 10vol% and above this concentration, H2 production was decreased. Surprisingly the highest activity at the optimum concentration is ascribed to the fruitful adsorption of the ethylene glycol on the surface of the photocatalyst and exhibit the effective photocatalytic surface reaction. Below the optimum level, only parts of the active sites adsorbed by ethylene glycol on the catalyst were utilized for the H2 production reaction. At higher concentration, the reaction medium become less polar nature and the active sites are saturated due to the high adsorption of ethylene glycol and its intermediates that hinder the catalytic activity. The chemical kinetics of alcohol concentration for the photocatalytic H2 production was reported by Chiarello et al. [46] and the results are well consistent with the present study [15,16]. Photocatalytic H2 production using Cu1.5TNT, Cu1.5pTNT, Cu1.5TNP, TNT, TNP and TP catalysts was carried out using aqueous ethylene glycol solution under the solar light irradiation. Table 1 shows the rate of H2 production in the present study using different photocatalysts in the following order of Cu1.5TNT>Cu1.5pTNT>Cu1.5TNP>TNT>TNP. The TP catalyst did not show any activity for photocatalytic H2 production, which is ascribed to the rapid surface recombination of photogenerated charge carriers [21]. The catalytic activity of the TNT showed two times higher activity than the TNP, which is due to improved opto-electrical properties and the large surface area of the 1-D TiO2 nanotubes [15]. The surface area of the TNT is about 3 times higher than TNP photocatalysts; however it is evident that the morphological property of one dimensional nanostructure is dominant factor for the enhanced activity rather than the surface area of the photocatalyst. The Cu1.5TNT exhibited 33 and 18 fold enhanced activity than TNP and TNT catalysts. This activity enhancement is due to the impregnation of the Cu x O into TiO2 nanostructures and synergetic properties of nanostructure of tubes, rods and particles of TiO2 [44,45]. It was found from the results that both the TiO2 nanostructures and Cu1.5TNT photocatalysts exhibited the similar crystalline nanostructure but Cu1.5TNT showed higher rate of H2 generation activity as compared with TNT. This is ascribed to the deposition of CuxO on the surface of TNT and CuxO could induce the photo-generation of charge carriers, which construct the photocatalytic sites and facilitate the charge separation and inhibiting the recombination of excited electron and hole pairs. In the present study, when the catalyst is irradiated, the photo-excited electrons are generated which migrate to the surface of photocatalyst and they are exceedingly trapped by the loaded Cu0, because the Fermi energy level of Cu0 is lower than that of the TNT. This effect is primarily attributed for the higher rate of H2 generation activity rather than the pure TNT crystalline structure [22]. As photocatalytic water splitting reactions involves in rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, a high degree of crystallanity plays a dominant role rather than the surface area of the photocatalyst. These results are in good agreement with earlier reported [47]. The high photocatalytic activity of Cu1.5TNT is achieved by the enhanced solar light absorption and the 1-D structure allows unidirectional electron transfer which can suppress the recombination of electron/hole pairs. In order to confirm reproducibility of the H2 production using Cu1.5TNT photocatalyst, three experiments were carried out at the same time. The results were averaged and the average value of H2 production is about 114.9±5mmolh−1 g−1 cat. The results are displayed in Fig.11. The overall water splitting experiments were carried out in the pure water using Cu1.5TNT catalyst and the H2 production rate of 1.06mmolh−1 g−1 cat was observed. In order to evaluate the stability performance of Cu1.5TNT photocatalyst, the experiments were carried out to confirm its stability under recycling study conditions. Fig. 12 displays amount of the H2 production tested for 3 cycles at 4h of solar irradiation. These results revealed that almost identical amount of the H2 generation was recorded in all the three experiments. The minor decrease in the total H2 generation was observed in 2nd and 3rd cycle. This is attributed to the oxidation of ethylene glycol in the solution which leads to decrease of ethylene glycol concentration and increase of the oxidation intermediates that could be adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalyst that influenced the light penetration to the surface and resulted decrease in the rate of the H2 production [18,42]. The stability of CuO/TiO2 and Cu2O/TiO2 nanocomposites under recycling conditions were reported elsewhere for the enhanced rate of H2 production under solar and visible light irradiation [15,16,45,46]. The plausible mechanism for highly efficient H2 production under solar irradiation using ethylene glycol as hole scavenger and Cu1.5TNT photocatalyst is depicted in Fig. 13. Excitation of narrow band gap semiconductor Cu2O in Cu1.5TNT photocatalyst under the visible light generates electron–hole pairs at conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB), respectively. These electrons are scavenged by Cu0 metal which is surface interacted with TiO2 nanostructures, followed by reduction reaction with protons to produce molecular hydrogen gas. The proposed reaction mechanism is in a good agreement with earlier report [36]. Sacrificial agents (water/ethylene glycol or its intermediates) are consumed by photo generated holes in the VB of Cu2O and TiO2 which results in generation of oxygen and carbon dioxide. The TiO2 nanostructures minimize the photogenerated charge carriers recombination which facilitates the enhancement of H2 production rate."
9,Conclusions,"In summary, the biphasic anatase-rutile TiO2 nanostructures decorated with Cu x O species dispersed on their surface display enhanced visible light absorption compared to the TNT and pTNT catalysts. Surface examination of Cu1.5TNT catalyst reveals the presence of both Cu2O and Cu° species, which serve a dual role of visible light sensitizer and co-catalyst. Additionally, the decrease of recombination between charge carriers as well as decrease of surface area is observed. The H2 production by water splitting is about 1.06±0.3mmolh−1 g−1 cat and it can be increased up to 114.9±2mmolh−1 g−1 cat under the optimal experimental conditions. The optimization of reaction parameters and the evaluation of photocatalytic activity of Cu1.5TNT photocatalyst leads to the conclusion that ethylene glycol favors a high rate of H2 production due to the number of hydroxyl groups. The observed highest activity can be attributed to the synergistic effects of nanocrystalline structure, the different morphology of TiO2, and the copper oxide species present in the composite photocatalyst. More importantly, the catalytic tests demonstrate the reproducibility and recyclability of the catalyst for at least 3 cycles without any significant loss in its activity. The long term activity experiments and continuous large scale production of H2 is in progress."
