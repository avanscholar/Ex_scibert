0,Introduction,"Given the rapid pace of human population growth and the higher standards of living in the 21st century, energy requirements and GHG emissions are forecast to increase in coming decades unless renewable sources of energy are introduced. According to the International Energy Agency, world energy demand increased from 6106 million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in 1973 to 13,371 Mtoe in 2012, which led to an increase in GHG emissions from 15,633 to 31,734 Mt. over the same period [1]. As a renewable energy source, biomass is the sole source of liquid fuel that has the potential to augment or replace our rapidly depleting fossil fuel resources and, at the same time, meet the criteria for sustainability and environmental friendliness. Biofuels (solid and liquid biofuels, biogases, industrial and municipal wastes) provided 5.3% of the world energy demand in 2013, which was more than twice as much as hydro power at 2.3% and more than three times that of other renewable sources (geothermal, solar, wind, heat, etc.) at 1.7% [1]. While biofuel production is expected to increase in coming decades, the development of energy efficient processes to meet the long-term objective of sustainability and economical processes to meet the short-term goals of the market are mandatory [2,3]. Therefore, economic analyses as well as energy efficiency, and life cycle assessments are pivotal for differentiating sustainable and non-sustainable processes, and also to identify wasteful energy losses in biofuel production [4,5]. The biochemical conversions of biomass to biofuels via the volatile fatty acids platform (VFAP) [6,7,8] and the sugar platform (SP) [9,10] have been widely reported in the literature. Through VFAP, all non-lignin parts of the biomass – i.e., carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids – are anaerobically digested to produce volatile fatty acids (VFAs) including acetic, propionic, and butyric acids, which can be further recovered and processed to produce mixed alcohols [6]. However, in SP, only the carbohydrate portion of the biomass is utilized to produce hexose and pentose sugars through hydrolysis and saccharification, which are later fermented by bacteria to ethanol [9,10]. The utilization of all parts of the biomass and the lower release of CO2 during anaerobic digestion in the VFAP results in a higher carbon yield (g alcohol/g dry biomass) in comparison to SP [6,7]. A mixed bacterial culture in VFAP can produce a range of different molecular weight VFAs (e.g., acetic, propionic, and butyric acids), whereas in SP, the utilization of a specific type of bacteria produces a specific type of alcohol (e.g., ethanol or butanol) from the sugars. VFAP can excel over SP in total yield (g fuel/g biomass) when a considerable portion of the biomass contains proteins and lipids. However, for biomass such as corn stover that contains mostly carbohydrates, SP can be more appropriate, especially when the production of a specific alcohol such as ethanol is mandated by governments as a fuel additive in gasoline [9]. Brown algae, as a third-generation biomass, have several advantages over first- and second-generation biomass by having no lignin in their chemical composition; furthermore, they require no land, irrigation water, or fertilizers for cultivation [11,12]. The main obstacles for biofuel production from seaweeds are their high cultivation costs, which attenuate the economics of the process, and the biofuel's selling price. Unlike corn, which is the main food source in most countries, brown algae are used as food mostly in China, Japan, and South Korea [13]. Therefore, it is expected that cultivating brown algae for biofuel production in the countries which seaweed is not their food source will neither influence the selling price of brown algae nor cause food vs. fuel debate. However, further progress in artificial seaweed cultivation technology and the development of low energy and capital cost processes for transforming brown algae to fuels are mandatory to make brown algae a sustainable biomass for fuel production. Brown algae contain about 40–60% dry wt. carbohydrate, 7–15% dry wt. protein, and 1–5% dry wt. lipids [12], which makes them appropriate for VFAP. The MixAlco® process is a biorefining technology that biochemically converts biomass through the VFAP into valuable chemicals such as acetic acid, ketones, and alcohols that can be further processed into renewable gasoline-type fuels [14,15]. There are two main routes for the MixAlco® process that have been widely studied, the ketonization route (KR) [14,16,17,18] and the esterification route (ER) [15,19]. In 2010, Terrabon Inc. [20], which holds the license for the MixAlco® process, constructed a demonstration plant at a scale of 50,000 gal per year to convert carboxylate salts into ketones. However, the MixAlco® process using brown algae as a feedstock has not been evaluated. The combination of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins in brown algae makes them an ideal biomass that can be appropriately utilized through the MixAlco® processes for mixed alcohol production. In addition, despite numerous experimental proof-of-concept studies on the MixAlco® process, there have been no comprehensive analyses based on the rigorous simulation of the process routes. Without rigorous process simulations, its precise energy requirements and unexpected process challenges during continuous operation might not be fully understood. The analysis of simulation results allows one to determine optimal process conditions within given limits, to improve the process design within a short period by answering “what if” questions, and to locate and remove constraints in the process (debottlenecking). This study evaluates the application of the MixAlco® KR and ER processes for alcohol production from brown algae for the first time. The processes were simulated using Aspen Plus v.8.6 software to obtain accurate material and energy balances, which were applied in a techno-economic model to evaluate the economic strength of each route. In addition, the CO2 equivalents (CO2-eq) emissions during operation were calculated to estimate the carbon footprints of the MixAlco® routes. An economic model was also used to calculate a maximum dry seaweed price (MDSP) in order to assess whether the process can operate economically at the current cost of brown algae cultivation. Sensitivity analyses were performed on different economic parameters to identify which variables had the highest impact on the MDSP."
1,Methodology and process description,"KR and ER are the two main routes of the MixAlco® process. Fig. 1 shows a block flow diagram of these routes using brown algae as the biomass. The basic difference between the two routes is that, in the KR, calcium carbonate is used as a buffer in the fermenters to produce calcium carboxylate salts, whereas in the ER, ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) is added to the fermenters to produce ammonium carboxylate salts. The use of ABC as the buffering agent helps to condition the fermentation broth and provides nitrogen for the mixed culture, which eventually could enhance the fermentation process and total VFA yield [21]. However, ABC is expensive in comparison to CaCO3 and requires high energy input for production. In the ER, the ammonium carboxylate salts are esterified and later hydrogenated to produce a mixture of primary alcohols. In the KR, the calcium carboxylate salts are thermally converted into ketones, which are subsequently hydrogenated into mixtures of secondary alcohols. Detailed process flow diagrams (PFD) are provided for main streams of the ER and KR supplementary data (Fig. S-1–13). Brown algae Laminaria japonica is the most cultivated type of seaweed with 5.15 million wet tons harvested in 2010 from wild habitats and aquaculture farms [22]. The main carbohydrates of brown algae include [10,11]: laminaran (β-1,3-linked glucan, (C6H10O5)n); cellulose (β(1,4)-linked D-glucose, (C6H10O5)n); mannitol (sugar alcohol, C6H14O6); alginate (an anionic polysaccharide composed of mannuronic and guluronic acids, (C6H8O6)n); and fucoidan (sulfated fucan). Table 1 shows the composition, elemental analysis, minerals, and heating value of L. japonica [12]."
2,Ketonization route (KR),"2.1 Ketonization route (KR) 2.1.1 Anaerobic digestion The fermentation unit receives brown algae L. japonica at a scale of 400,000 ton/year dry brown algae. It was assumed that the biomass contains 20 wt% moisture upon reaching the plant gates. In the fermentation unit, the brown algae L. japonica is anaerobically fermented to produce a mixture of VFAs, including acetic, propionic, and butyric acids. Pham et al. [8] studied the anaerobic digestion (AD) of the brown algae L. japonica. They reported a VFA yield of 0.307–0.412 g VFA/g dry L. japonica after 5 days of fermentation at 35 °C. Therefore, an average yield of 0.35 (g VFA/g dry L. japonica) and five days fermentation time were assumed in this study. Fresh water and recycled water from the dewatering unit are added to the fermentation reactors to reach a product VFA concentration of 5 wt% [8,15]. Fig. S-2 of supplementary data shows the PFD for the fermentation unit of the KR. Iodoform is added to the slurry at a concentration of 30 ppm to prevent the conversion of the VFAs to methane by methanogens [15]. The molar VFA product distribution reported by Pham et al. [8] was 67% acetic acid, 22% propionic acid, and 11% butyric acid. Fasahati and Liu [23] obtained fermentation reactions for this product distribution from the literature. Table S-7 in the supplementary data shows the set of stoichiometric reactions considered in the fermenters. The produced VFAs react with the calcium carbonate in the fermentation reactors to produce carboxylate salts through the following reaction: (1) 2 R - COOH + CaC O 3 → R - COO 2 Ca + H 2 O + C O 2 The liquids and dissolved carboxylate salts are separated from the solid residues of the fermentation process using a solid/liquid separator. The solid residues retain a noteworthy amount of nutrients such as phosphate, nitrate, and fiber, which makes them a valuable fertilizer. Therefore, about 20% of the solids are recycled to fermenters as a source of nutrition and bacteria during fermentation, and the rest is considered a coproduct of the plant that can be sold on the local market. The liquid product containing the carboxylate salts is sent to a dewatering unit for dehydration and salt recovery. 2.1.2 Dewatering The dewatering unit in the KR is designed to dehydrate and recover the dry carboxylate salts. Fig. S-3 of the supplementary data shows the PFD for the dewatering unit of the KR. The dilute stream of carboxylate salts received from the fermentation unit is preheated using condensed vapors exiting the multistage evaporators. The multistage evaporator concentrates the dilute stream of salts to 50% mass concentration. A six-stage evaporator is used to evaporate the water and concentrate the salts [14,16,24]. A minimum temperature difference of 10 °C is imposed between the hot and cold streams at each stage. In every stage, the inlet streams pass through a valve and a heater to be adjusted to saturation conditions. In the preheater of the first stage, medium pressure (MP) steam at 184 °C is used to raise the temperature of the dilute stream to 164 °C; for other stages, low pressure (LP) steam at 164 °C is utilized for preheating. The saturated liquid stream enters the latent heat exchangers, which use the heat from the condensing vapor coming from a previous stage to vaporize water from the dilute stream. The produced vapors enter the latent heat exchanger of the next stage. The vapors from the last stage are compressed to a higher temperature and pressure in a steam compressor and are then saturated, so they readily condense and transfer heat to the first stage. The heat produced during the compression of the steams in the compressor is also used to preheat the dilute stream of carboxylate salts coming from the fermentation unit. The concentrated streams from each stage are mixed and sent to a rotary dryer to produce the dry calcium carboxylate salts. The rotary dryer uses LP steam as source of heat for drying the salts. The dried salts are sent to the ketonization unit using solid-handling equipment. The condensed vapors from the multi-stage evaporators are mixed together and used to preheat the incoming dilute VFA stream from the fermentation reactors; then, ~95 wt% is recycled as a source of water to the fermentation unit and the rest is sent to the wastewater treatment unit. 2.1.3 Ketonization The dried salts from the dewatering unit are preheated using the heat from the ketone vapors produced in the ketonization reactors. Later, they are heated using a fired heater to the 430 °C ketonization temperature [17,18]. Fig. S-4 of the supplementary data shows the PFD for the ketonization unit of the KR. Long reaction times in the ketonization reactor result in low yields due to production of side products from the degradation of the ketones. Therefore, to ensure a short residence time, low pressure (30 mmHg, [16]) is maintained inside the reactors using vacuum pumps and by condensing the vapor ketone products. Davison and Holtzapple [25] designed a process for thermally converting carboxylate salts to ketones. In the ketonization reactor, the carboxylate salts were decomposed to form vapor ketones and solid calcium carbonate. Reaction (2) shows the thermal decomposition of the carboxylate salts to ketones [17]: (2) RCOO − C a 2 + R ′ COO − → RCO R ′ + CaC O 3 Pham et al. [26] studied the ketonization of carboxylic acids and described the mechanism of ketone formation. The ketonization process results from the conjoining of two carboxylates, thereby forming longer carbon chains. The combination of expected products from the ketonization of a feed mixture of calcium acetate, calcium propionate, and calcium butyrate includes acetone, 2-butanone, 2-pentanone, 3-pentanone, 3-hexanone, and 4-heptanone. The results from the Aspen Plus simulation showed a ketone product distribution of 30 wt% acetone, 43 wt% 2-butanone, 16 wt% 2-pentanone, 5 wt% 3-pentanone, 3 wt% 3-hexanone, and 2 wt% 4-heptanone as the output of the reactor. It is assumed that only 95 wt% of the produced CaCO3 is recoverable and recycled back to the fermentation unit. The remaining 5 wt% is considered as solid waste to compensate for possible losses, impurities, degradation, or contamination. The vapors exiting the reactor exchange heat with the carboxylate salts and are then further cooled using the liquefied ketones. According to the Clausius–Clapeyron relationship, the boiling temperature is a direct function of the pressure, and since the operating pressure of the process is very low (30 mmHg), the condensation temperature of the ketone mixture is also reduced from their normal boiling points. Based on the results of the Aspen Plus simulation, the ketone mixture condenses at −10 °C. Therefore, a refrigerant (i.e., propane) at −20 °C is required to provide the necessary cooling for the condensation. The liquefied ketones exchange heat with the vapor and solid CaCO3 residues of the ketonization reactor and reach 130 °C. Later, the liquid ketones are pressurized using pumps to reach a hydrogenation pressure of 55 bar and are sent to the hydrogenation unit. 2.1.4 Hydrogenation In the hydrogenation unit, the ketone carbonyl group reacts with hydrogen to form an alcohol group in an exothermic reaction: (3) R - CO - R ' + H 2 → R - CH OH - R ' The hydrogenation of ketones results in the formation of secondary alcohols (reaction (3)). The reaction is performed under high pressure (55 bar) and isothermal (130 °C) conditions [16]. Chang [27] described the optimal design for the hydrogenation of ketones as a series of three continually stirred tank reactors (CSTR), which afforded a 98.4% conversion of the ketones into the alcohols. In each CSTR, the liquid ketones, solid Raney nickel catalyst, and hydrogen bubbles are well mixed. Hydrogen is fed to every CSTR in 5% molar excess. The heat of reaction is recovered using the boiler feed water (BFW) to produce LP steam. Fig. S-5 of the supplementary data shows the PFD for the hydrogenation unit of the KR. The BFW is first preheated by the product alcohols stream exiting from the last hydrogenation reactor and then evaporated by the heat of the hydrogenation reaction in each reactor. The partly evaporated BFW stream is further heated to 164 °C by exchanging heat with the CaCO3 solids from the ketonization unit. The alcohol products are further cooled to 65.5 °C by means of cooling water before being sent to the first flash drum. From there, 98% of the recovered vapor phase is compressed in a multi-stage compressor and recycled to the hydrogenation reactor, while the remaining 2% is purged. The bottom stream of the first flash drum is further flashed to 2.4 bar and sent to the second flash drum. The vapor from the second flash drum along with the purge gases from the first flash drum are mixed and used as fuel for the fired heater in the ketonization unit. The bottom stream of the second flash drum, which contains 29.9 wt% 2-propanol, 42.5 wt% 2-butanol, 16.0 wt% 2-pentanol, 5.3 wt% 3-pentanol, 2.7 wt% 3-hexanol, 2.1 wt% 4-heptanol and unreacted ketones, is pumped to the alcohol recovery and separation unit. 2.1.5 Alcohol recovery The alcohol recovery unit includes two distillation columns to separate the product alcohols. Fig. S-6 of the supplementary data shows the PFD for the alcohol recovery unit of the KR. The first column separates propanol from the heavier alcohols, from the top of the column. The second column receives the bottom products from the first column and separates butanol from the top and the C5–C7 alcohols from the bottom. The alcohols received from the hydrogenation unit are preheated by the top and bottom products of the second column before entering the first column. The first column is designed to recover 99% of the incoming propanol from the top and 99% of the butanol from the bottom. A partial vapor–liquid condenser is specified in the first column to separate the unreacted hydrogen and other light gases from propanol at the top of the column. The gases are recycled as fuel for the fired heater in the ketonization unit. The recovered propanol has a purity of 95 wt% and contains about 5 wt% unreacted low-molecular-weight ketones. The bottom product of the first column is pumped to the second column. The second column is designed to recover 99% of the butanol from the top and 99% of the pentanol from the bottom. The recovered butanol has a purity of 98 wt% and is cooled to 38 °C by heating the feed to the first column and cooling water. The C5+ alcohols recovered from the bottom contain 80 wt% 2- and 3-pentanol, 10 wt% 3-hexanol, and 7.7 wt% 4-heptanol. About 12% of the C5+ alcohols are used as fuel for the fired heater in the ketonization unit, and the rest is cooled to 38 °C using cooling water after preheating the feed to the first column. It is anticipated that the remaining C5+ alcohols would make an excellent gasoline additive or gasoline replacement [28]."
3,Esterification route (ER),"2.2 Esterification route (ER) 2.2.1 Anaerobic digestion The anaerobic digestion unit is similar to the one in the KR. The only difference is that, in the ER, ABC is added as the buffer to the fermenters. Fig. S-8 of the supplementary data shows the PFD for the fermentation unit of the ER. ABC is received from the ABC production unit and is reacted with the VFA fermentation products through the following stoichiometric reaction [15]: (4) R - COOH + N H 4 HC O 3 → R - COON H 4 + H 2 O + C O 2 2.2.2 Dewatering The target of the dewatering unit in the ER is to increase the concentration of the ammonium carboxylate salts in the fermentation products. Fig. S-9 of the supplementary data shows the PFD for the dewatering unit of the ER. Ammonium carboxylate salts are very soluble in water, and reaching a high concentration of 50 wt% salts without oversaturation is possible [19,29]. In this study, a concentration increase from 5 to 40 wt% in the dewatering unit was considered. The unit uses six stage evaporators. The process structure and description is similar to the one described in Section 2.1.2 for the KR. 2.2.3 Esterification In the esterification unit, the concentrated ammonium carboxylate salts are reacted with 1-heptanol in the presence of a solid acid catalyst to produce esters, water, and ammonia through the following reaction [19,30]: (5) R - COON H 4 + C H 3 C H 2 5 C H 2 OH → R - COOC H 2 C H 2 5 C H 3 + N H 3 + H 2 O Fig. S-10 of the supplementary data shows the PFD for the esterification unit of the ER. Fresh heptanol together with recycled heptanol from the alcohol recovery unit is mixed with the concentrated ammonium salts. The mixture is preheated by the heat from the hydrogenation reaction in the hydrogenation unit. Later, the mixture is heated using MP steam to reach the 150 °C esterification temperature [15]. The reaction temperature for the esterification process depends on the type and molecular weight of the alcohol used. Reaction temperatures ranging from 100 to 200 °C have been reported in the literature for alcohols, depending on molecular weight [31,32]. Since esterification is an endothermic reaction, higher temperatures can accelerate the forward reaction (reaction (5)). In general, primary alcohols afford higher conversions to the esters than secondary alcohols. In addition, high-boiling alcohols are reported to result in higher esterification rates and yields [33]. Ammonia and water are also products of the esterification reaction. Because the continuous removal of ammonia and water can speed up the esterification, a reactive distillation column (RDC) is used. The esterification reaction occurs in the reboiler of the RDC. Esters are generally immiscible with water, resulting in the formation of two liquid phases. Therefore, the RDC is designed to have 25 stages with vapor–liquid–liquid phases at each stage. The mixture of esters, water, and ammonia exits from the top of the column and is partially condensed at 60 °C. The partly condensed mixture is sent to a decanter to separate the ester-rich and water-rich liquids from the vapors. The vapors contain ammonia and water and are recycled to the ABC production unit. The water-rich phase is recycled to the RDC as reflux. A decanter on stage 10 of the RDC removes the water-rich phase and returns the ester-rich phase to stage 11. The water-rich phase contains a small amount of esters and is considered as wastewater from the process. From the last stage of the column, the ester-rich phase is extracted, mixed with the recovered ester-rich phase from the decanter of the condenser, and pumped to the hydrogenation unit. The recovered ester stream contains 63.7 wt% heptyl acetate, 23.2 wt% heptyl propionate, 12.5 wt% heptyl butyrate, and about 0.7 wt% dissolved water and ammonia. 2.2.4 Hydrogenation In the hydrogenation unit, the esters are reacted with hydrogen to produce heptanol, ethanol, propanol, and butanol. Industrially, fatty esters have been hydrogenated to fatty alcohols in the presence of heterogeneous catalysts such as copper chromite, Raney nickel, and Pd/ZnO at high temperatures (200–300 °C) and high hydrogen pressures (200–300 atm) [34,35]. A 97% conversion of esters at 200 psi and 200 °C is considered in hydrogenation reactors [15,35]. The stoichiometric reaction for the hydrogenation of esters is shown in reaction (5). (5) R - COOC H 2 C H 2 5 C H 3 + 2 H 2 → R - COH + C H 3 C H 2 6 OH The esters received from the esterification unit and the recycled esters from the alcohol recovery unit are mixed with high-pressure hydrogen and are preheated first by the products of the hydrogenation unit and later by the heat from a fired heater to reach the 200 °C hydrogenation temperature. Fig. S-11 of the supplementary data shows the PFD for the hydrogenation unit of the ER. The fired heater uses the purge gases of the hydrogenation unit and part of the unreacted esters recycled from the alcohol recovery unit. The produced alcohols are cooled by preheating the feed to the hydrogenation reactors and cooling water. Two flash drums in series are used to depressurize the alcohols and recycle the unreacted hydrogen, as described in Section 2.1.4. The product alcohol stream contains 17.5 wt% ethanol, 7.6 wt% propanol, 4.7 wt% butanol, 66.4 wt% heptanol, and about 4 wt% water, ammonia, and unreacted esters. 2.2.5 Alcohol recovery The alcohol recovery unit contains three distillation columns to separate and recover the alcohols. Fig. S-12 of the supplementary data shows the PFD for the hydrogenation unit of the ER. The first column recovers 99.5 wt% of incoming butanol from the top in the vapor phase and 99.5 wt% of the heptanol from the bottom. Since the boiling points of ethanol and propanol are lower than butanol, they are also recovered from the top of the first column. The vapors of the light alcohols are sent to a second column to separate ethanol from propanol and butanol. The second column is designed to recover 99% of the ethanol from the top and 99% of the propanol and butanol mixture from the bottom. The propanol and butanol mixture preheat the supplementary heptanol stream of the esterification unit and then are further cooled to 38 °C using cooling water. The recovered ethanol stream has a purity of 96.5 wt% and contains most of the dissolved water from the esterification unit. To meet the ASTM ethanol fuel specifications, the mass purity of the ethanol must be 99.5 wt%. Further dehydration of the ethanol stream can be performed using molecular sieves or membranes. Fasahati and Liu [36] compared the economics, energy, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of molecular sieves and membranes for the dehydration of ethanol and reported that membranes have lower energy and capital costs, as well as lower GHG emissions, compared to classical molecular sieves/distillation systems. Therefore, membrane separation was considered for the further dehydration of ethanol. The membrane considered was an α-alumina pervaporation membrane developed by Sato and Nakane [37]. The membrane has a selectivity and permeate flux of 10,000 and 5.6 kg/m2·h at 75 °C, respectively. The ethanol vapor stream recovered from the top of the second column is contacted with the membranes. A vacuum pump maintains a constant pressure on the permeate side of the membranes at 1 kPa. Propane refrigerant at −20 °C is used to condense the water permeates. The recovered cold water permeates are recycled to the ABC production unit. The dried ethanol vapors are condensed using cooling water and pumped as the product of the process. The bottoms of the first column contain 96 wt% heptanol and 4.2 wt% unreacted esters. The heptanol should be recycled to esterification unit. The direct recycle of the bottom stream results in the accumulation of unreacted esters in the process. Therefore, an additional distillation column (third column) is required to separate the unreacted esters from the heptanol. The boiling points of 1-heptanol, heptyl acetate, heptyl propionate, and heptyl butyrate are 175.8, 192, 209, and 225 °C, respectively. Since the mixture does not form an azeotrope, the heptanol can be recovered from the top and the esters from the bottom. The third column is designed to recover 98% of the heptanol from the top and 90% of the heptyl acetate from the bottom. The recovered heptanol is recycled to the esterification unit. About 90% of the recovered esters are recycled to the hydrogenation unit and the remaining amount, together with the purge gases from the hydrogenation unit, are used as fuel for the fired heater. The fired heater provides heating to achieve the hydrogenation temperature in the hydrogenation unit and also for the reboilers of the first and third columns in the alcohol recovery unit. However, the heat provided by the fired heaters is insufficient to meet the heating demand of the reboiler of the third column, and supplementary high-pressure (HP) steam at 254 °C is used. 2.2.6 ABC production ABC is produced as a buffer for the fermentation reactors in the ABC production unit. Fig. S-13 of the supplementary data shows the PFD for the ABC production unit of the ER. The ABC production process is similar to ammonia-based CO2 capture. However, in this case, the goal is to produce solid ABC rather than capture CO2. There have been numerous studies regarding the optimal design of ammonia-based CO2 capture systems [38,39]. The ammonia-based CO2 capture processes operate at low temperature, in the range ~5–15 °C. Lower absorption temperatures increase the solubility of ammonia in water and decrease the ammonia slip [38]. Kinetic model reactions of CO2 with NH3 and H2O are given in Table 2 [40]. An optimization over the temperature range 5–15 °C was performed using Aspen Plus for the maximum production of ABC and minimum production of by-products such as NH4 + andNH2COO-, considering the costs of ammonia and cooling for the process. The results showed that the optimal temperature for absorption is 5 °C, which was considered in this study. Fresh ammonia and water are mixed with the recycled ammonia and water from the esterification and alcohols recovery units. The produced stream is first precooled by the bottom products of the absorption column, and second, by exchanging heat with a refrigerant to reach 5 °C; the stream is then fed to the absorption column from the top. The fermenter gases containing CO2 are passed through a blower. The fermenter gases are first precooled by the products of the absorption column and second, by chilled water, and finally by refrigerant to reach 5 °C and enter the absorption column from the bottom. The absorption column is a packed column specially designed to provide maximum contact between the ammonia, CO2, and water [39]. The ABC production reaction is exothermic. Therefore, refrigerant is used to keep the temperature constant at 5 °C inside the absorber. The liquid product stream of the absorption column contains 25 wt% ABC and is pumped to the fermenters after precooling the feeds to the absorption column."
4,Process simulation,"2.3 Process simulation The KR and ER were simulated using Aspen Plus v.8.6 (Aspen Tech, Cambridge MA) at a plant scale of 400,000 ton/year dry brown algae. The non-random two-liquid (NRTL)-Haydon O′Connell (HOC) thermodynamic/activity model was selected as the property package to model the non-ideal behavior of the liquid phase. The HOC equation reliably predicts the solvation of polar compounds and dimerization in the vapor phase, as occurs with mixtures containing carboxylic acids [40]. The ABC production unit of the ER was modeled using the electrolyte-NRTL model for describing the chemical equilibria among the different molecules and ions in the process. The chemical composition of brown algae presented in Table 1 was used as the biomass composition. Most of the components were available in the Aspen Plus data banks. However, Fasahati et al. [10] defined the properties for unavailable components according to the physical property database developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) for bioethanol from lignocellulosic biomass [9]. An efficiency of 80% was assumed for the centrifugal pumps in the simulation. The hydrogenation compressor in the KR and ER was modeled as a three-stage centrifugal compressor with 78% polytropic efficiency and interstage cooling to 60 °C [28]. The process power requirements for solid handling was scaled from NREL's report for ethanol production from corn stover [9]. The membranes were modeled as component separators and a calculator block was used to calculate the composition of the permeate based on the selectivity and objective ethanol concentration in the retentate. The RStoic reactor model was used to simulate the fermenters and hydrogenation reactors. The ketonization reactor was modeled using the RGibbs reactor in Aspen Plus to find the ketone product distribution and production by minimizing the Gibbs free energy of the mixture. Separate heater blocks for hot and cold streams with a connecting heat stream was used in the Aspen Plus simulation to model the heat exchanger network. This approach enhances the readability and convergence of the simulation. However, to make sure that the heat exchange between two hot and cold streams is realistic and possible, all the streams that exchange heat are duplicated using DUPL block in Aspen Plus and are connected to HeatX block which has two input/output for hot and cold streams (not shown on the PFD in the supplementary data). Inside the block, minimum temperature difference between hot and cold stream imposed according to heat integration criteria described in Section 2.4. Aspen Plus constant default values were used for overall heat transfer coefficient values of each combination of phases on the hot and cold sides of the exchanger. The calculated output temperatures of hot or cold streams are assigned to the relative heat exchanger in the simulation using Calculator blocks in Aspen Plus. The HeatX block calculates the required heat transfer area, which was used for capital costs calculation of heat exchangers. All distillation columns in the process were rigorously simulated using the RadFrac module of Aspen Plus. Design specifications within RadFrac were used to achieve the purification and recovery targets in each column. The sequence of distillation columns, thermal integration of columns, number of stages, type of trays, reflux ratios, and column pressures was designed according to [9,28,41]."
5,Heat integration,"2.4 Heat integration Heat integration analyses were performed for the KR and ER in order to minimize the utility requirements. An inventory of the hot and cold streams was provided for each process and ordered by temperature range. Matches between near streams and in the same plant section were preferred. A minimum temperature difference (MTD) of 10 °C was imposed for all heat-transfer matches except solid-vapor matching in the ketonization unit, where a MTD of 30 °C was assumed. The heat produced during the hydrogenation reactions in the KR was recovered by producing LP steam from the BFW. Appropriate utilities were used in cases where process-to-process heat transfer did not cover the heating and cooling demands. Cooling water (24–35 °C) was used to meet cooling demands above 40 °C. Chilled water (4–15 °C) was used to keep the temperature constant at 35 °C in the fermenters. Liquid propane (−20 °C) was used as a refrigerant for the liquefaction of permeates and the ketone products of the ketonization process, and also for the cooling demands of the ABC production unit in the ER. LP and MP steams at 164 °C and 186 °C, respectively, were used as heating sources in the processes."
6,GHG emissions,"2.5 GHG emissions The KR and ER have different energy requirements and use different utilities in their units. They also require different amount and type of raw material for production process. Consequently, the amount of wastewater and byproducts produced in each process are different. This leads to different amount of carbon footprints and environmental emissions for each process. It was of interest to calculate the CO2-eq emissions related to direct emissions during operation for both processes to understand which process has lower GHG emissions. The approach used to calculate the GHG emissions from utility consumption was based on the methodology defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The GHG emissions caused by steam production were calculated by assuming natural gas as a fuel source and a boiler efficiency of 80% [42]. After obtaining the total fuel requirements, the GHG emissions caused by burning natural gas were extracted from [43]. GHG emissions due to electricity consumption in the process were calculated based on average US annual output emission rates for electricity production [44]. The electricity requirement for the production of 1 m3/h cooling water is 0.254 kW, according to [9]. GHG emissions caused by the refrigerant were derived by calculating the amount of electricity required to produce one-ton refrigeration. Based on [45], compression refrigeration with a 38 °C condenser requires 1.31 kW/ton of refrigeration at −20 °C, and a ton of refrigeration indicates the removal of 12.7 MJ/h of heat. The emissions for chilled water production were calculated based on the formula given by U.S. Department of Energy [46]. Emissions caused by burning part of the unrecovered heptanol were obtained through stoichiometric reactions for burning a corresponding amount of heptanol. GHG emissions from wastewater treatment was calculated according to the EPA instruction [47]. The properties of the wastewater produced in the process are considered to be equal to the wastewater produced in ethanol production from corn stover [9,48]. A total chemical oxygen demand (COD), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), and methane yield of 64 g/L, 1200 mg/L, and 51%CH4/49%CO2 in digesters was considered, respectively. GHG emissions for hydrogen and ammonia production were obtained from National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) report as 4.7 kg CO2eq/kg H2 and 1.41 kg CO2eq/kg NH3, respectively [49,50]. Emissions of GHGs were converted to CO2-eq using 100-year global warming potentials (GWPs). The 100-year GWPs for CH4 and N2O are 25 and 298, respectively [43]."
7,Techno-economic model,"2.6 Techno-economic model The techno-economic model considered in this study is similar to that developed by the NREL for bioethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass [9]. The model was used to develop a discounted cash flow analysis to assess the economics of the KR and ER, by calculating the total capital investment (TCI) as the sum of the land, working capital, direct, and indirect costs. Direct and indirect costs are functions of the total installed and direct costs, respectively. Table S-8 of supplementary data explains the parameters considered and the methodology used to calculate the direct and indirect costs. Then, the fixed capital investment (FCI) was calculated as the sum of the direct and indirect costs. The TCI of each process was calculated as the sum of the FCI, land, and working capital. Table 3 shows the methodology for calculating the latter two parameters, as well as other assumptions of the techno-economic model. The operating costs include the variable operating costs (e.g., processing chemicals) and fixed operating costs (e.g., employee salaries, overhead, maintenance, and insurance). The variable costs were calculated based on simulated mass and energy balance results, as well as the raw material prices reported in Table S-9 of the supplementary data. Fixed operating costs include labor and maintenance costs, and property insurance and tax. The labor and maintenance costs were estimated as 1.6% and 3.0% of the TCI, respectively, and the property insurance and taxes were collectively estimated as 0.7% of the FCI (Table S-9 of the supplementary data). The revenues of the process come from the sales of the alcohol products and digestate (solid residues from the AD). An ethanol wholesale price and digestate selling price of 2.58 $/gal and 10.4 $/ton were considered in this study for the year 2012, respectively (see Table S-9 in the supplementary data). The prices of other alcohols were scaled from the ethanol price based on their mass fractions and relative heating values. The price of the digestate is dependent on the demand in the local market for fertilizer. Therefore, the price of the digestate might vary throughout the year. A sensitivity analysis was performed in Section 3.4 on the prices of the alcohols and digestate to understand the impact of price variations on the economics of the process. The capital costs of the distillation columns, reboilers, condensers, hydrogenation reactors, and flash drums were scaled based on vendor quotes. Table S-10 of the supplementary data shows vendor quotes for the capital costs of the equipment. Eq. (6) shows the scaling formula used to calculate the cost of the new equipment based on vendor quotes and their relative scales. In this equation, (n) is the scaling exponent which is a number between 0.5 and 0.8, depending on the type of the equipment. Table S-11 of the supplementary data provides the values of n for different process equipment. (6) Cos t New = Cos t base Scal e New Scal e base n The cost estimation for all other equipment (e.g., pumps, steam compressor, heat exchangers) was performed based on the module-costing technique and relationships published by Turton et al. [45]. The base year for the economic analysis was considered to be 2012. Therefore, all the equipment costs were updated to 2012 dollars using the chemical engineering plant cost index (CEPCI) through the following equation: (7) 2012 cost = base cost CEPCI 2012 CEPCI base year The membrane costs were derived from the 2015 target of the National Energy Technology Laboratory of the U.S. DOE [51] for hydrogen production using ceramic and metallic membranes, which is roughly 1000 $/m2. The durability or membrane lifetime is another uncertainty. The 2015 target of the DOE is 5 years, which was adopted in this study. The membrane costs were calculated by multiplying the membrane costs per m2 by the membrane area required. A 10% overhead rate was applied to the membrane cost to cover the costs for the membrane module, including the casing, sealing, and instrumentation. The techno-economic model was used to calculate the net present value (NPV) of the project, which is defined as the “cumulative discounted cash position at the end of the project.” The NPV of a project is greatly influenced by the level of fixed capital investment. A better criterion for the comparison of projects with different investment levels is the present value ratio (PVR) [45]: (8) PVR = Present Value of All Positive Cash Flows Present Value of All Negative Cash flows A PVR of unity for a project represents a break-even situation. Values greater than unity indicate profitable processes, whereas those less than unity represent unprofitable projects. The NPV and PVR were calculated as indexes to evaluate and compare the economics of the KR and ER for 20 years of plant life, considering a 10% internal rate of return and 100% equity financing. It is noteworthy that the techno-economic model considered in this study was based on n th-plant economic assumptions [9]. n th-plant economics assumes several plants using the same technology have been built and are operating."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Energy costs,"3.1 Energy costs The material and energy balances obtained from the Aspen Plus simulation were used to develop an inventory of utilities for each unit of the KR and ER. Then, energy costs were obtained using the rate of consumption of each utility multiplied by its price (Table S-9, supplementary data). Table S-1 to S-6 of the supplementary data provides the material and energy balance results of the Aspen Plus simulation for the KR and ER. The KR requires less fresh water compared to the ER, mainly because most of the water is recovered through the multistage evaporators in the dewatering unit of the KR. More fresh water is required in the ER because of the dissolved esters, ammonia, and other impurities. This eventually results in a greater wastewater flowrate in the ER compared to the KR. Fig. 2 shows the utility costs of each unit of the KR and ER. The total annual energy costs of the KR and ER were calculated as 11.6 and 37.2 million dollars/year. The total energy requirement of the ER is more than three times of that of the KR. The main energy-consuming unit for the KR is the dewatering unit, whereas those for the ER are the alcohol separation, esterification, dewatering, and ABC production units. Fig. 2 shows that the KR has higher chilled water energy demands compared to the ER because the reaction of the carboxylic acids with CaCO3 is more exothermic than the one with ABC. Therefore, the cooling demands of the fermentation reactors in the KR are higher than in the ER. In addition, because of the higher heat of reaction, the calcium carboxylate salts are more stable than the ammonium carboxylate salts; the latter dissociate at lower temperatures compared to the former. From Fig. 2, the heating requirements of the dewatering unit are higher for the KR than for the ER. This obtains because, in the KR, the calcium carboxylate salts must be dehydrated and recovered in dried form prior to transfer to the ketonization reactors, whereas in the ER, the ammonium carboxylate salts are only concentrated to 40 wt%. Fig. 2 also shows that, for both processes, the dewatering units have the highest electricity requirements. The main consumers of this energy are the steam compressors that pressurize the low-pressure steam from the last stage of the multistage evaporators and recycle it to the first stage as a source of heat. As shown in Fig. 2, the esterification unit in the ER requires a huge amount of heating energy in comparison to the ketonization unit in the KR. One reason for this difference is the flowrate of the feed material to these units. The esterification unit of the ER has an input feed flowrate of 86,750 kg/h, which is almost four times that of the 22,500 kg/h feed flowrate to the ketonization unit of the KR. Heptanol has a high molecular weight (116.2 g/mol). Therefore, a high mass flowrate of heptanol (35 wt% of input feed) is required to provide a stoichiometric equivalent amount for reaction with the VFAs in the esterification process. This endothermic reaction occurs at 150 °C inside the reboiler of the RDC. Heptyl acetate, heptyl propionate, and heptyl butyrate are the main products of the esterification, with boiling temperatures of 192, 209, and 225 °C, respectively. The reboiler of the esterification column must also provide the latent heat of vaporization of these components together with ammonia and water to maintain the vapor boil-up rate inside the column. All these energy requirements for the esterification process make it very energy-intensive and costly. In contrast, the ketonization process has much lower energy costs. The ketonization reaction is also an endothermic process and occurs at 430 °C. A fired heater, which uses the purge gases of the hydrogenation unit and part of produced heavier alcohols in the process as fuel, meets the heating demands of the ketonization unit. A cost of zero is considered for the fuel in the fired heater because it is produced in the process and not purchased from outside. As a result, the only costly utility in the ketonization unit of the KR is the refrigerant to condense the vapors from the ketonization process. The hydrogenation unit in the ER also has higher energy requirements in comparison to the one in the KR. The hydrogenation of each mole of ester requires two moles of hydrogen (reaction 5), whereas for each mole of ketone, only one mole of hydrogen is required (reaction 3). Therefore, a higher hydrogen mass flowrate is required and circulated in the hydrogenation unit of the ER compared to the KR, which eventually results in the higher electricity demands of the hydrogen compressor in the ER compared to the KR (Fig. 2). The heat of the hydrogenation reaction in the ER is used to preheat the feed to the esterification column, whereas, in the KR, the heat of hydrogenation is recovered by the production of LP steam. The revenues from steam production are shown as a negative value in Fig. 2. The separation unit in the ER has the highest energy costs compared to the other units. The main component of these costs is from burning the unrecovered heptanol either as the individual molecule or as a building block of the unreacted esters. Heptanol, together with the unreacted esters, is recovered from the bottom of the first distillation column in the alcohol recovery unit, and accounts for as much as 96 wt% of the recovered stream. Since heptanol has a lower boiling temperature than the esters, it should be recovered from the top of the distillation column. Therefore, a large boil-up ratio is required to recover 98% of the incoming heptanol from the top of the column. About 90 wt% of the unrecovered heptanol and unreacted esters is used to fuel a fired heater. However, heptanol is an expensive chemical, and the cost of supplementary heptanol is about 15 million dollars/year, which by itself exceeds the total energy costs of the KR. The ABC production unit requires 2.78 million dollars/year of refrigeration energy (Fig. 2) to provide the necessary cooling demands for the production of the ABC required as the buffer in the fermenters. However, in the KR, CaCO3 is recovered as a solid residue from the ketonization reaction and can be recycled without additional processing to the fermenters. Considering the cheaper price of CaCO3 compared to NH3, the cost of the supplementary buffer for the KR is much lower in comparison to the ER. This also effectively enhances the economics of the KR over the ER."
10,"Total investment costs, NPV, and PVR","3.2 Total investment costs, NPV, and PVR The NPV and PVR were calculated for the profitability analysis of the KR and ER over 20 years of plant life. Table 4 summarizes the total installed equipment cost and illustrates the application of techno-economic factors to obtain the TCI, operating costs, NPV, and PVR. The installed costs of the fermentation and hydrogenation units are the same for the KR and ER. However, the installed cost of the dewatering unit is higher for the KR compared to the ER, because in the KR dewatering unit, additional equipment (i.e., a rotary dryer) is required for the drying and transfer of the solid carboxylate salts to the ketonization unit. The cost of the ketonization unit in the KR is about 2 million dollars more than the esterification unit in the ER. The higher capital cost of the ketonization unit originates from the costs of a fired heater to provide the heat of ketonization and additional equipment for handling the solid residues of the process. The capital cost of the separation unit in the ER is 8.7 million dollars, which is more than five times that of the one in the KR (Table 4). Here, the cost is for the fired heater that provides heating for the reboilers of the distillation columns and hydrogenation unit. In addition, the separation unit of the ER has an additional distillation column (third column) for the separation and recovery of heptanol from the unreacted esters. The ER has an additional unit for ABC production that has a capital cost of 2.4 million dollars. The sums of the total installed costs of the KR and ER are 52 and 52.9 million dollars, respectively. The TCIs are calculated to be 105.9 and 107.6 million dollars for the KR and ER, respectively, which are fairly similar. However, the ER has ~42.3 million dollars/year higher utility and operating costs, mainly because of the energy requirements of the esterification process and the purchasing costs of supplementary fresh ammonia, heptanol, and hydrogen. The annual hydrogen cost for the ER is 12.5 million dollars, whereas for the KR, it is 3.2 million dollars. In addition, the ER requires about 7.8 and 15.0 million dollars/year for ammonia and heptanol purchases, respectively. The higher utility and operating costs of the ER result in a negative NPV value and a PVR value of less than one (0.48) over a 20-year plant life. Therefore, the ER would not be a profitable process. However, the NPV for the KR is 61.1 million dollars and the PVR is more than one (1.57), which shows the profitability of the process."
11,Carbon footprint,"3.3 Carbon footprint Fig. 3 shows the GHG emissions of the KR and ER during plant operation. The total CO2-eq emissions are calculated to be 109,700 and 307,600 ton/year for the KR and ER, respectively. The GHG emissions caused by burning part of the produced heavier alcohols in the processes are not included in the calculations, and only GHG emissions from nonrenewable sources are shown in Fig. 3. GHG emissions of the ER are about three times as high as the KR, making the latter a more sustainable process. The amount of wastewater produced in the ER is about five times more than the KR (Table S-1 and S-4 of the supplementary data). Therefore, one of the main sources of emissions in the ER is GHG from wastewater treatment. Generally, because the ER uses ammonia as feed to the ABC unit, there is a possibility that higher amount of TKN be available in wastewater of the ER, which can further increases the N2O emissions from wastewater treatment. Because of higher hydrogen requirements of the ER compared to the KR, the amount of GHG emitted by hydrogen production from nonrenewable sources are much more for the ER compared to the KR (Fig. 3). The heating energy demands in the esterification and separation units of the ER, together with the refrigeration energy demands in the ABC production unit, are very large, which makes them the main CO2 emitting utilities in the ER. A main portion of GHG emissions in ABC production unit of the ER is caused from GHG emissions from supplementary ammonia production required for ABC unit. In the KR, the main CO2 emitting unit is the dewatering unit. Therefore, lowering the energy requirements or development of alternative dewatering processes with lower energy demands for VFA recovery can further reduce the GHG emissions of the KR."
12,Maximum dry seaweed price,"3.4 Maximum dry seaweed price The techno-economic model can be used to calculate the maximum dry seaweed price (MDSP). The MDSP defines a maximum margin for the purchasing price of brown algae in order to make the NPV equal to zero after 20 years of plant operation. Any purchasing price above the calculated MDSP results in a negative NPV and any price below that is favorable and results in a positive NPV. In addition, the MDSP can be used as an index to evaluate the economics of alternative processes that use brown algae as biomass. A process that leads to a higher MDSP value is economically advantageous. The calculated MDSP is the price of the feedstock at the plant gates, which includes the costs of cultivation, collection, and distribution. The breakdown of the MDSP for the KR is shown in Fig. 4 . An MDSP of 90 $/ton was calculated for the KR using the techno-economic model to reach a breakeven point after 20 years of plant operation. A comparison of the calculated MDSP (90 $/ton) with the current brown algae price of 68 $/ton (Table S-9 of the supplementary data) shows that the KR can tolerate seaweed price increases of up to 32% of its current price. It was of interest to compare the economics of the KR, which uses the VFAP, with the SP for ethanol production reported by Fasahati et al. [10]. The process evaluated by Fasahati et al. [10] utilizes acid thermal hydrolysis at 120 °C as pre-treatment process. The pre-treated biomass are enzymatically saccharified and produced sugars are fermented to ethanol at a total yield of 0.254 wt ethanol/wt dry brown algae. Distillation columns and molecular sieves are used to dehydrate ethanol to 99.5%. Fig. 4 also shows the calculated MDSP by Fasahati et al. [10]. Results show that the VFAP (KR) has better economics compared to the SP. A comparison of MDSPs for both processes shows that the SP has higher investment, utility, and variable costs compared to the KR. This is mainly because in the SP higher capital costs are required for ATH pretreatment, neutralization, saccharification, and fermentation units. In addition, recovery and dehydration of ethanol from fermentation broth has higher energy demands and requires higher capital costs compared to the KR. From Fig. 4, revenues from selling ethanol in the SP is higher than the revenues from mixed alcohols in the KR. However, higher revenues of the SP can not compensate its increased capital and operating costs compared to the VFAP. Therefore, the MDSP for the KR (90.0 $/ton) is higher compared to the one in the SP (71.5 $/ton) which indicates that the VFAP has better economics compared to the SP."
13,Sensitivity analysis,"3.5 Sensitivity analysis 3.5.1 Impact of economic parameters It was of interest to perform a sensitivity analysis on the different economic parameters to identify the principal factors affecting the plant economics for the KR. The parameters considered for the sensitivity analysis included the selling price of the alcohols and digestate, the FCI, the annual utility costs (AUC), the internal rates of return (IRR), and the plant life. It is expected that the selling price of the products will deviate between ±25% of their base value. The uncertainty in the calculated capital and utility costs of the plant is also expected to deviate between a maximum and minimum of ±25% of their base value. Therefore, these parameters were changed to ±10% and ±25% of their base value, and their impact on the MDSP was evaluated. However, the IRR and plant life were varied between 5 and 15% and 10–30 years, respectively, which was about ±50% of their base value. Fig. 5 shows the impact of the variations on the MDSP for the KR process. The sensitivity analysis results show that, in the order of their magnitude, the alcohols selling price, FCI, AUC, IRR, plant life, and digestate selling price have the highest impact on the MDSP. The MDSP changes linearly as the parameters are varied between their minimum and maximum values, except for plant life, for which the MDSP shows higher sensitivities at lower plant life compared to higher plant life. A ten-year decrease in plant life reduces the MDSP from its base value of 90 $/ton (20-year plant life) to 80 $/ton, while a ten-year increase in plant life to 30 years increases the MDSP only about 2 $/ton to 92 $/ton. The alcohols selling price has the highest impact on the MDSP. Changes of −25% and +25% in the propanol, butanol, and pentanol + selling prices change the MDSP from 78 to 101.5, 73 to 107, and 80 to 100 $/ton, respectively. Changes of −25% and +25% in the FCI changed the MDSP to between 98 and 82 $/ton, respectively. Changes in the AUC and IRR have similar impacts on the MDSP, and −25% and +25% changes in their values vary the MDSP to between 95 and 84 $/ton, respectively. The digestate selling price has the lowest impact on the MDSP, and ±25% changes in its base value only alters the MDSP by about 1 $/ton from its base value of 90 $/ton. 3.5.2 Impact of hydrogen recovery Hydrogen is produced as a side product of the AD reactions (Table S-7 of the supplementary data). The vapor products of the fermenters in the KR contain about 42 mol% (3.5 wt%) hydrogen and 46 mol% (83.9 wt%) CO2, with the remainder comprising water, ammonia, oxygen, and hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen can be recovered from the fermenter gases through pressure swing absorption (PSA) to meet the hydrogen demands of the hydrogenation unit. Therefore, it was of interest to assess the impact of hydrogen recovery on the MDSP as an index for the plant economics of the KR. The PSA function was added to the fermentation unit and simulated based on the study by Spath et al. [52]. The vapors from the fermenters were compressed in a two-stage isentropic compressor to 25 atm with interstage cooling to 60 °C. The compressed gases were further cooled to 40 °C by cooling water, and the entrained liquids were removed in a knock-out drum. According to [53], the feed gases to the PSA unit must contain at least 70 mol% hydrogen, because a lower concentration of hydrogen would decrease the product purity and recovery. The reaction between the VFAs and calcium carbonate in the fermenters (reaction (1)) results in the additional production of CO2 in the KR, which further dilutes the hydrogen concentration in the fermenter gases. A lower concentration of hydrogen in the fermenter gases (42 mol%) requires that a larger portion of the recovered hydrogen product be recycled back into the PSA feed to reach the target 70 mol% hydrogen concentration in the PSA feed stream. According to Spath et al. [52], 85% of the hydrogen at a product purity of 99.9 vol% is recoverable through the PSA if the hydrogen concentration in the PSA feed is 70 mol%. Simulation results showed that about 78% of the recovered hydrogen stream must be recycled to reach this hydrogen concentration in the feed stream. The simulation also showed that the PSA unit can separate and recover ~310 kg/h hydrogen. The hydrogenation unit consumes hydrogen at a rate of ~268 kg/h, which costs ~3.21 million dollars/year. The remaining hydrogen is assumed as a by-product of the plant at a price of 1.5 $/kg (Table S-9 of the supplementary data). The capital costs of the PSA unit were scaled from the capital costs report (vendor quotes) by Spath et al. [52] (Table S-10 of the supplementary data). The total capital costs of the PSA unit are calculated to be 9.7 million dollars. The techno-economic model was updated for the new capital costs and the material and energy balance from the simulation, to calculate the MDSP of the process. A MDSP value of 87.3 $/ton was calculated, which shows that the addition of the PSA unit to the KR does not enhance its economics, mainly because of the high capital costs and high energy demand of the PSA unit. The low concentration of hydrogen in the fermenter gases requires that a larger portion of the recovered hydrogen is recycled to the PSA unit. The higher flow rates of the input stream increase the capital costs of the PSA unit. In addition, the electricity demand of the compressor of the PSA unit for the fermenter gases costs about 1.27 million dollars/year, and is the main energy consumer of the PSA unit."
14,Conclusion,"Two well-known routes for the MixAlco® process, i.e., the KR and ER, were evaluated for alcohol production from brown algae in terms of their economics, energy requirements, and GHG emissions. The results showed that the ER is not an economical process, primarily because of its high energy demands for esters and alcohols recovery as well as high supplementary raw material costs. Further experimental studies are recommended to evaluate the use of lighter molecular weight alcohols for esterification process to reduce the recovery costs. However, in that case, some of the challenges to overcome would be reduced esterification rate and increased solubility of low molecular weight esters in water, which can make water-ester separation problematic. Use of ABC in fermentation reactors of the ER enhances the fermentation reactions. However, results showed that the production process of ABC is energy intensive and expensive due to refrigerant and fresh ammonia requirements. In addition, produced ammonium carboxylate salts are sensitive to higher temperatures. Therefore, there is a possibility that part of produced salts dissociate at high temperature stages of multistage evaporators of the dewatering unit. Results showed that the KR is economically viable with much lower energy requirements and carbon footprint compared to the ER. The dewatering unit of the KR is the most energy-consuming unit. Therefore, developing alternative low energy and more efficient salt recovery technologies from fermentation broth can effectively reduce the process energy costs. Higher solid loadings rate could be a potential solution for that. However, it will adversely influence conversion rates in AD reactors. Further experimental studies are required to optimize the operating conditions of fermentation reactors and develop bacteria that can tolerate higher solid loadings and produce higher VFA yields at the same time. A calculated MDSP of 90 $/ton for the KR shows that the process can be implemented industrially, considering current brown algae cultivation costs. However, as the results of this study showed, brown algae cost constitute 65% of total operating cost for the KR indicating a huge potential for enhancing the process economics by lowering the cultivation costs. Therefore, further R&D on artificial seaweed cultivation is crucial to increase the yield and lower the cultivation costs to make brown algae an economical and sustainable biomass resource for biofuels production."
