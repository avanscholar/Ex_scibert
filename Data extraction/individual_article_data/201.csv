0,Introduction,"With the continuous growth of the population, the rise of industrial activities, and the stable growth of the fossil fuel-based economy, a large number of harmful substances are released into the air and water, causing numerous problems [1]. Thus, we urgently need to find an ideal alternative energy and take a sustainable and environmentally friendly development path to eliminate the above challenges [2–6]. Solar energy is a kind of inexhaustible source of green energy, which is a more appropriate alternative energy source to meet the continuous growth of the world population and the increasing global energy demand. So solar-to-energy conversion is a promising approach to resolve the global energy problems. Photocatalysis can be traced back to the discovery of bleaching dyes and degrading cellulose by TiO2 under UV irradiation in the presence of oxygen in 1930s [7]. However, because of the limitations of theories and analytical techniques at that time, this phenomenon does not evoke much attention until the discovery of water splitting, photocatalysis achieves a landmark leap [8]. Since then, many different photocatalysis materials such as semiconductors, transition metal complexes, etc. have been dramatically examined for the photocatalysis process. In recent years, a series of visible-light-responsive semiconductor photocatalysts such as g-C3N4, CdS and BiVO4 have been extensively investigated [9–11]. However, in most cases, the photocatalytic reaction rate is low due to low reaction kinetic parameters and inefficient energy utilization [12]. In order to increase the reaction rate, the synergistic effect between co-catalysts (such as Pt, Ni2P, MoS2) and hole scavengers (such as methanol, ethanol, lactic acid) has been investigated [13–16]. This is conducive to charge separation, thereby increasing the photocatalytic reaction rate, but it also causes waste half of photogenerated charge carriers, and increases the cost of the system, produces some unwanted byproducts such as CO2 simultaneously [17,18]. At the same time, when sacrificial agents are added, usually only one of the two redox semi-reactions is valuable. If the other one cannot be properly treated, it will be a bottleneck in the photocatalytic reaction process, with producing the result that we do not want or even reducing the value of the reaction sometimes, so that there is not much practical economic value [19–21]. It is well known that the partial oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds is one of the most important conversion processes in organic synthesis, either in the experimental scale or in industrial scale, which is of great significance and has attracted extensive attention of researchers [22–24]. The traditional selective oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes is achieved in the presence of stoichiometric oxygen donors (such as chromate, permanganate, hypochlorite and peroxyacid). However, most of these are harmful and toxic in the reaction [25,26]. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new reaction system to realize the above reaction under environmentally friendly conditions. In recent years, some research teams have realized the selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols to aromatic aldehydes and the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline in one system under nitrogen atmosphere [27,28]. In this system, aromatic alcohol is oxidized by photogenerated holes to aromatic aldehyde, and nitrobenzene is reduced to aniline by photogenerated electrons. The photogenerated electrons and holes are simultaneously utilized in this system. However, there is still a problem in this kind of system. When the redox potentials of the reactants and products overlap partly, this reaction will be trapped in an endless loop. Based on the above results, it is inspired to develop a new reaction system that couples selective organic transformation and chemical fuel generation, which can realize the automatic separation of redox products in solution and gaseous phase spontaneously, avoiding the problems mentioned above [29–36]. These reaction systems are called dual-function reaction systems and have been extensively studied in recent years. Simultaneously, in these reactions, the solvent effect is also an important factor that cannot be ignored. Previous works have shown that there are differences in the yield of products in different solvents [37]. Cadmium sulfide (CdS) has received huge attention due to its wide application in some important fields. Previous studies have shown that the VB potential of CdS is about 1.88 ​V (vs. NHE), which provides sufficient oxidation capacity for the selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols to aromatic aldehydes, and the CB position is about −0.52 ​V (vs. NHE), which is sufficient to drive the reduction of H+ to H2 [38,39]. Furthermore, the modification of precious metals (such as Pt, Au and Ag) as promoters will facilitate the spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes on the semiconductor surface, thereby improving the performance of photocatalysts [40,41]. This method is also used in some important photocatalytic fields, such as photocatalytic water splitting, photocatalytic organic synthesis, photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction, and photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. But its high cost makes it difficult to realize industrialization. In addition to rare metals and precious metals, some non-metals and low-cost transition metals such as Ni [42], P [43], Co [44] and Fe [45]. At the same time, the combination of co-catalyst and semiconductor plays an important role in improving reaction kinetics. Herein, the CdS&P25–Ni2P (SPN) photocatalyst has been prepared by solvothermal and calcined method. The obtained photocatalysts have been fully characterized by a series of methods. The maximum rate of H2 production reaches 0.986 ​mmol·gcat −1·h−1 in aqueous solution. When the aqueous solution is replaced with an organic solvent, the maximum rate of H2 production is 1.148 ​mmol·gcat −1·h−1. Different possible reaction mechanisms and reaction paths were proposed through compare the study of water and acetonitrile."

Other photocatalysts with different ratio of CdS and PN were prepared for comparison."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) has been characterized by a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation and the scanning angle ranged from 10° to 90° of 2θ at a scan rate of 1.5°/min. The morphology and structure of the materials have been detected by a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM) under an accelerating voltage of 15 ​kV. The morphologies and high-resolution images have been researched by a field emission Tecnai G2 F20 transmission electron microscopy with an acceleration voltage of 200 ​kV.

The specific surface area and pore size distribution were calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) formula and the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) formula, respectively. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cycle voltammetry (CV), Mott-Schottky (MS), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) have been conducted using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E) in a three-electrode system. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) measurement has been carried on Varian 715-ES."
5,Photocatalytic activity test,"2.4 Photocatalytic activity test Photocatalytic dehydrogenation reactions were performed in a photocatalytic reaction system (Merry Change, MC-SPH20-A) with 50 ​mL pure liquid containing 50 ​mg photocatalyst, and 4 ​mM corresponding alcohols. The system was sealed, vacuumized for 30 ​min and then irradiated by a 300 ​W Xe lamp. The temperature of the reaction system is maintained by a cooler and controlled at about 8 ​°C. The generated H2 during the reaction was analyzed online and quantified by gas chromatography (GC 7920, N2 carrier gas, Beijing China Education Au-light Co., Ltd.). The product obtained in the experiment was centrifuged and the supernatant was gathered, then 600 ​μL supernatant has been taken out and dried under vacuum at room temperature. Then C2D6OS was used to dissolve the solids and 10 ​μL methanol solution with a concentration of 0.031 ​mol/L was added to it as an internal standard. Finally, the MestReNova software was used to calculate the concentration of products. The conversion, selectivity and yield efficiency were calculated according to Eqs. (1)–(3): (1) Conversion ​ ( % ) = n i n i t i a l a l c o h o l − n r e s i d u a l a l c o h o l n i n i t i a l a l c o h o l × 100 % (2) Selectivity ​ ( % ) ​ = n p r o d u c e d a l d e h y d e n i n i t i a l a l c o h o l − n r e s i d u a l a l c o h o l × 100 % (3) Yield ​ ( % ) = n p r o d u c e d a l d e h y d e n i n i t i a l a l c o h o l × 100 %"
6,Photoelectrochemical tests,"2.5 Photoelectrochemical tests Photoelectric chemical properties of catalysts have been investigated using a three-electrode potential station (CHI 660 ​E) with a saturated Ag/AgCl (in 3 ​M KCl) as a reference electrode and a platinum sheet as the counter electrode.

LSV and CV were conducted at a scan rate of 10 ​mV/s. Mott-Schottky diagrams were obtained at 1 ​kHz. EIS was measured in the frequency domain from 1 ​Hz to 100 ​kHz and modulation amplitude of 10 ​mV."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalysts characterization,"3.1 Catalysts characterization Fig. 1 A-C are the SEM image of CdS, P25 and the composite catalyst SPN. We can observe that the ultra-thin CdS nanobelt structure was synthesized by the simple solvothermal method, and the obtained CdS formed a porous network structure due to the stacking of sheets, as shown in Fig. 1A. The SEM image of P25 is shown in Fig. 1B. It is a uniform particle with an average size of about 25 ​nm. The SPN has shown in Fig. 1C, and PN is supported on the surface of CdS. There is no obvious damage in the CdS porous network after the loading with PN and the porosity of Cds is preserved, allowing products and reactants to freely migrate through the CdS network. Fig. 1 D-I are the TEM images of CdS, P25 and SPN, respectively, and the conclusion consistent with the SEM results can be obtained. Fig. 1 F-G are the HRTEM images of SPN, in which three lattice fringes can be clearly seen. The distances between the three adjacent fringes are about 0.210 ​nm, 0.314 ​nm and 0.290 ​nm, respectively. After comparing with the literature results, it is found that they are (002), (110), and (001) crystal planes of CdS and TiO2. (JCPDS 41–10490, JCPDS 21–1272). It can also be found from Fig. 1 H–I that PN is loaded on the surface of CdS, which is also consistent with SEM results above. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of CdS, P25 and SPN are shown in Fig. 2 A. All the three samples have type III adsorption-desorption isotherms, indicating that the samples have weak adsorption interactions and porous structures. The pore size distribution curves of samples are shown in Fig. 2B. After loading, the specific surface area is between the two raw materials. This is also consistent with the result in the SEM. The specific surface area of the CdS, P25, SPN are 155.57, 50.44, 85.88 ​m2/g and the pore volume are 0.56, 0.13, 0.37 ​cm3/g, as shown in Table S1. These characteristics are conducive to the uniform distribution of photocatalyst nanoparticles. The crystal structures of CdS, P25 and SPN were analyzed by XRD, as shown in Fig. 2C. The pristine CdS has characteristic diffraction peaks at 25.8°, 26.9°, 28.9°, 37.3°, 44.1°, 45.5° and 52.4°, corresponding to (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (112) of the hexagonal phase CdS (JCPDS 41–10490), respectively. The diffraction signals of P25 are located at 25.8°, 38.4°, 48.4°, 54.3°, 55.6°, 63.1°, corresponding to (101), (103), (200), (105), (211), (204) of TiO2 (JCPDS 21–1272), respectively. The diffraction peaks of hexagonal Ni2P at 40.8°, 44.9°, 47.8°, 54.4° and 55.2° are consistent with the (111), (201), (210), (300) and (211) planes (JCPDS 03–0953). The positions of the diffraction peaks of SPN are consistent with the positions of the characteristic diffraction peaks appearing in the pristine sample, indicating that the composition of the catalyst does not change the crystal phase of samples. The surface chemical states of various elements in the composite catalyst were investigated by XPS, and the signals from Cd, S, Ti, Ni and P can be identified, as shown in Fig. 2 D-I. The peaks at 405.2 (Cd 3d5/2) and 411.9 ​eV (Cd 3d3/2) in Cd 3d (Fig. 2D) [48] and two peaks at 161.1 (S 2p3/2) and 162.4 ​eV ​(S 2p1/2) in S 2p (Fig. 2E) [49] have the characteristics of CdS. The Ti peaks at 458 ​eV and 463.5 ​eV correspond to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 (Fig. 2F), the P 2p1/2 peak at 133.5 ​eV (Fig. 2G) and the two peaks in Ni 2p peaks at 855.6 ​eV and 873 ​eV (Fig. 2H) belong to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively [50]. Fig. 2I is the XPS full spectrum of CdS, PN and SPN. Comparing the XPS spectra of Ni and P before and after the coincidence, it was similar to indicate that the chemical structure of Ni and P has not been destroyed after the composite, while the positions of Cd, S and Ti peaks have slightly shifted. It is speculated that the coordination between CdS and Ti in P25 may lead to the change of chemical structure. In order to further study the optical properties of the sample, UV–Vis DRS spectroscopy was performed on the catalyst to investigate the performance, as shown in Fig. S1. UV–Vis spectrum revealed that P25 has no absorption at 385–800 ​nm, while PN has an absorption in the range of 385–800 ​nm. When PN is composited with CdS, CdS has a narrow band gap, the optical properties of the composite can be improved and the absorption range can be broadened to the visible region. All samples show strong absorption in the 200–400 ​nm range, but their absorption range values are different. Therefore, the absorption of visible light is mainly CdS and Ni2P. SPN shows a stronger absorption band edge (550 ​nm) in the visible light region than CdS and PN. This may be due to the black appearance of Ni2P and a narrow band gap (about 1.0 ​eV [51])."
9,Evaluation of photocatalytic activity,"3.2 Evaluation of photocatalytic activity The photocatalytic performance of phoeocatalyst is tested by a photocatalytic system under the irradiation of a 300 ​W Xe lamp (AM 1.5G), in which p-benzenedimethanol (4 ​mM) in water is oxidized. Primarily, the photocatalytic performance of SPN in hydrogen evolution is evaluated. The results of different ratios of catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . Different compounding ratios and control experiments have shown that the compound ratio of CdS to PN is 1:3 (SPN) with the best hydrogen production performance, as shown in Fig. 3A. The retention time curves of gaseous products at various reaction periods are shown in Fig. 3B and hydrogen production versus reaction time from samples with different composite have been studied, as shown in Fig. 3C. In order to explore the role of substituents in the oxidation of aromatic alcohols, a control experiment was conducted with o-benzenedimethanol and m-benzenedimethanol as organic substrates. The results show that SPN is also suitable for these aromatic alcohols and the hydrogen production is not much different, as shown in Fig. 3D. At the same time, the control experiment study shows that the hydrogen produced basically comes from the reaction substrate, the reactant and the photocatalyst are indispensable, as shown in Fig. S2. The main composition of the liquid phase product of the possible product standard substance and terephthalic methanol conversion was determined by UV–Vis. As shown in Fig. S3A, in the spectrum of the main composition of the liquid product, two obvious characteristic absorption peaks have been found, located at 206 ​nm and 257 ​nm, respectively. By comparison, it is found that the possible product in the liquid phase is p-hydroxymethyl benzaldehyde, as shown in Fig. S3B. To verify the results of the UV spectrum, it was further confirmed by NMR, as shown in Fig. S4. In the 1H NMR spectrum, the characteristic peak corresponding to p-hydroxymethyl benzaldehyde can be found. The conversion, selectivity and yield were calculated according to the NMR and the result was shown in Fig. S5A. The conversion increases with time, while the yield increasing to a certain value and remaining stable. The selectivity reached maximum value at 40 ​min, and then decreased. In order to prove that the occurrence of this phenomenon is not accidental, repeated experiment has been carried out to verify the reliability of the conclusion. As shown in Fig. S5B, almost consistent results appeared. It is inferred from this that the presence of aldehyde groups hinders the oxidation of alcohol in p-benzenedimethanol, and p-hydroxymethyl benzaldehyde is the final product of the reaction. The same analysis was performed on the liquid phase product of o-phthalmethanol, and the result is shown in Fig. S6. The characteristic peaks of its hydroformylation products also appeared in the NMR spectrum. The conversion, selectivity and yield of the reaction were calculated according to the NMR results, as shown in Fig. S7. The conversion increases with time, and the yield increases to a fixed value and remains stable. The difference to p-benzenedimethanol is that the selectivity of the o-benzenedimethanol transformation product does not have an inflection point, but is basically maintained at the same level, as shown in Fig. S7. The NMR spectrum of the liquid phase product of m-benzenedimethanol is shown in Fig. S8. The conversion, selectivity and yield were also calculated based on the NMR results, as shown in Fig. S9. The conversion increases with time, the yield increases to a fixed value and then remains stable. The selectivity has the maximum value at 40 ​min, and then decreases with the increase of time. The result is similar to that of p-benzenedimethanol. Among the three groups of substituents, although the conversion of m-benzenedimethanol has the highest value, the yield still maintains the same level as that of the liquid-phase conversion product of p-benzenedimethanol, which is also consistent with the hydrogen production in Fig. 3D. From the above experiments, we found that in water the existence of aldehyde groups will hinder the further oxidation of another alcohol in benzenedimethanol, and that hydroxymethyl benzaldehyde is the final product of the reaction, and there is no peroxidation reaction. The photocatalytic hydrogen production experiment was carried out to verify the photocatalytic stability of the catalyst. When the photocatalyst was recycled for the second cycle, the hydrogen production decreased significantly, and the fourth cycle was less than 0.5 ​mL, as shown in Fig. 4 A. In order to study the deactivation reason of the catalyst, the catalysts after cycling were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM and ICP-AES. It can be seen from the XRD patterns that one of the crystals faces of CdS disappears and the diffraction peaks of other crystal faces weaken in varying degrees, as shown in Fig. 4B. Fig. 4C shows the SEM images of the catalyst after the cycle experiment. Furthermore, compared with Fig. 1C, the porous network structure of the catalyst was destroyed, and the catalyst was agglomerated. This phenomenon can also be found in TEM image, as shown in Fig. 4D. ICP-AES was used to determine the content of Cd, Ni and S elements in SPN, the recovered catalyst and the solution after the reaction, as shown in Table S2. The content of Cd element in the catalyst is relatively stable, most of Ni element is dissolved in water, and part of S element is also dissolved in water. Based on the above results, it is inferred that the main reasons for catalyst deactivation are as follows: S element is partially dissolved in water, causing the change of CdS crystal plane, resulting in a decrease in catalyst activity. Most of the Ni element on the co-catalyst was exfoliated and dissolved from the catalyst to water, resulting in a rapid decline in the hydrogen production efficiency of the catalyst. Analogously, replace the aqueous solution with an acetonitrile solution to verify the influence of the solvent effect on the reaction, and the plot of hydrogen production versus reaction time with different substrates in acetonitrile have been shown in Fig. 5 A. Compared with o-benzenedimethanol and m-benzenedimethanol, the hydrogen production of p-benzenedimethanol is relatively low, which is quite different from the results in water. Compared with the hydrogen production curve of the two solutions, it is found that the hydrogen production curve owns a better linear relationship in organic solution. It is preliminarily speculated that there may be different reaction paths and different reaction kinetic parameters in the two solutions. Meanwhile, the results of the comparative experiments show that the hydrogen produced is from the reaction substrate, and photocatalysts are indispensable. The conclusion is consistent with that in the aqueous solution, as shown in Fig. S10. Fig. S11 shows the 1H NMR spectrum of the p-benzenedimethanol substrate and the liquid phase conversion product. According to the spectrum, the conversion, selectivity and yield were calculated, as shown in Fig. S12. The conversion of the reaction increases with the increase of time, while the selectivity decreases with the increase of time, and the yield is basically maintained at a constant value. This result is also consistent with the result of hydrogen production in Fig. 5A, but compared with the reaction in aqueous solution, the yield is much smaller. Fig. S13 shows the 1H NMR spectrum of the m-benzenedimethanol substrate and the conversion product. According to the spectrum, the conversion rate, selectivity and yield were calculated. Compared with the results in the water system, the conversion has decreased, but the selectivity and yield have increased a lot. It is speculated that in the acetonitrile, the product can be better dissolved, thus pushing the reaction forward. Fig. S14A is the NMR 1H spectrum of the o-benzenedimethanol, transformation product and phthalein pristine substance. The illustrations in Fig. S14 B–C are the 1H spectra specific areas of the transformation products and phthalein pristine materials, respectively. Different from other reaction substrates, a new set of characteristic peaks have been obtained, which are attributed to phthalide. According to the spectrum, with phthalide as the final target product, the conversion, selectivity and yield were calculated. In this system, the conversion of reactants is more than 95%, the substrate can be almost completely transformed, and the selectivity and yield are maintained at a medium level. In the spectrum, new characteristic peaks that do not exist in other conversion products have been found, which further proves that there are indeed different reaction paths in organic solutions and in aqueous solutions. In the acetonitrile solution, o-benzenedimethanol can be additionally subjected to a ring-forming dehydrogenation process, which has a higher hydrogen production. The photocatalytic hydrogen production cycle experiment in acetonitrile was used to verify the photostability. After 5 cycles, no obvious deactivation occurred, indicating that the photocatalyst owns stable photocatalytic activity, as shown in Fig. 5B. The results show that the photocatalyst has more stable performance in organic solvents. The recovered catalyst was characterized by XRD, as shown in Fig. 5C. After the cycle experiment, although the signals of each crystal surface peak are weakened, they are retained, which proves once again that SPN possesses better photocatalytic stability in acetonitrile solution. The element content of the catalyst after the reaction in the organic solution is also analyzed by ICP. The content of Cd, Ni and S elements in the SPN, the recovered catalyst and the dissolved in acetonitrile after the reaction, as shown in Table S3. The content of Cd element in the catalyst is relatively stable. Compared with most of the Ni element and the part of S element falling off in the aqueous solution, the two elements are well retained in the sample from the organic solvent."
10,Reaction mechanism,"3.3 Reaction mechanism The CdS, PN and SPN prepared in the experiment were coated on the surface of FTO to make electrodes, and a three-electrode system was used for photo-electrochemical testing in a mixed solution of 0.1 ​M Na2SO4 and triethanolamine (TEOA, volume fraction 10%). The result was shown in Fig. 6 . As shown in Fig. 6A, with 100 ​mW/cm2 (AM 1.5G) intermittent light, the transient photocurrent response of pristine CdS and PN can reach 1.05 ​μA/cm2 and 4.23 ​μA/cm2, respectively, and the transient photocurrent density of SPN increases significantly. Photocatalytic stability of the catalyst characterized by chronoamperometry curve (I-T) under the condition of 0 ​V vs. Ag/AgCl. The I-T curves of CdS, PN and SPN are shown in Fig. 6B. The results are consistent with those in Fig. 6A. SPN has the best photoelectric response ability. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to evaluate the kinetic information of electrons at the electrode/electrolyte interface, as shown in Fig. 6C. SPN has the smallest arc radius, which means that it has the smallest resistance among the three materials, indicating that the electrons and holes in SPN can be separated more quickly and effectively. In order to further explore the charge transport mechanism in SPN and the reasons for the enhancement of the photoelectric performance of the catalyst, the Mott-Schottky has been used to obtain the carrier density and the flat band potential (Efb) at the interface between the semiconductor electrode and the electrolyte, as shown in Fig. 6D. It can be seen that the slopes of the three catalysts are all positive, indicating that the composite catalyst does not change the semiconductor characteristics of the original catalyst. The flat band potentials of CdS, PN and SPN were −0.6 ​V vs. Ag/AgCl, −0.51 ​V vs. Ag/AgCl, −0.50 ​V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. The difference of Efb between CdS and SPN is 0.1 ​V, while that between PN and SPN is almost the same. It can be inferred that the formation of heterojunction between CdS and PN can accelerate the charge transfer speed between semiconductors [52], weakening the recombination of electron-hole pairs, and improve the photocatalytic activity. In combination with the above analysis, the possible mechanism of the photocatalytic transformation of p-benzenedimethanol to p-hydroxymethylbenzaldehyde coupling with hydrogen production over SPN samples under light irradiation is proposed, as shown in Fig. 7 A. Photogenerated carriers migrate outward from the surface of P25 under illumination. Because of the low reduction potential of Ni2P, photogenerated electrons are transferred from P25 to Ni2P nanoparticles. Meanwhile, due to the low conduction band position of CdS, photogenerated holes migrate from the valence band of P25 to the valence band of CdS. As a result, photogenerated electrons gather on the outer surface of P25 and photogenerated holes gather on the outer surface of CdS [27]. The electrons that migrate to the outer surface of P25 participate in H2 production. The holes accumulated on CdS can oxidize alcohols. SPN exposes an ideal spatially separated redox surface, which promotes the organic transformation coupling with hydrogen production. Generally, the photocatalyst is excited by light to produce photogenerated electrons and holes. In aqueous solution, the hydroxyl group of o-benzenedimethanol is oxidized by photogenerated holes to form radicals and protons. Then, the hydrogen radical is eliminated to form the intermediate 2-(hydroxymethyl) benzaldehyde. On the other hand, the excited electron reduces the proton to form a hydrogen radical, which reacts with another hydrogen radical to form H2. The organic products and H2 are released, and then the photocatalyst proceeds to the next cycle, as shown in curves Ⅰ and Ⅱ. For acetonitrile, the hydroxyl group of the intermediate 2-(hydroxymethyl) benzaldehyde can be further oxidized, and the formed oxygen radicals partially attack the carbonyl carbon to form the final product phthalide and hydrogen radicals. The generated hydrogen radical can react with another hydrogen radical to form a molecule of H2 again, as shown in curves Ⅰ and Ⅲ [53]."
11,Conclusion,"In this paper, semiconductor compositing and co-catalyst loading have been used to synthesize SPN photocatalyst. This material can make full use of photogenerated electrons and holes, and simultaneously selectively transform aromatic alcohols into aromatic aldehydes coupling with hydrogen evolution under mild conditions in a dual photocatalytic system. Mechanism exploration experiments have shown that the hydrogen produced during the reaction basically comes from aromatic alcohols and different possible reaction mechanisms and reaction paths were proposed through compare the study of water and acetonitrile. This paper further explores the field of organic value-added transformation coupled with hydrogen production and provides a new strategy for the effective use of photogenerated electrons and holes, which will be inspirational for the future involving catalysis, materials and other fields."
