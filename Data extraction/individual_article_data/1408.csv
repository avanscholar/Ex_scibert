0,Introduction,"As important industrial materials, polyether polyols (PPs) are used widely in the polyurethane industry, such as in polyurethane foams (Lee, Ha, Kim, Baik, & Hong, 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Prociak et al., 2019), elastomers (Sonnenschein, Virgili, Larive, & Wendt, 2018), non-ionic surfactants (Kasza et al., 2017), adhesives (Akram, Gurney, Zuber, Ishaq, & Keddie, 2013; Fuensanta & Martin-Martínez, 2019), and plasticizers (Zhang et al., 2018). However, PPs are produced from petroleum resources and so are non-renewable and increasingly expensive. It is therefore important to replace petrochemical PPs with biomass, and there has been researched into preparing bio-based PPs by liquefying renewable and cheap biomass resources (Li et al., 2017). Liquefaction is a fast and efficient way to convert raw biomass materials into liquid polyols (Sendijarevic et al., 2020). Currently, the relatively mature liquefaction method uses polyols such as polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, and diethylene glycol as the solvent, and an acid or a base as the catalyst; the liquefaction reaction is carried out at temperatures of 393–453 K under atmospheric pressure, and the liquefaction rate can reach 60–100 % (Li et al., 2017; Sendijarevic et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2019). Some studies (Dhaliwal, Anandan, Chandrashekhara, Lees, & Nam, 2018; Sendijarevic et al., 2020) have reported synthesizing PPs using biomass such as wood (Yasuji, Shuichi, & Yasuo, 1999), banana pseudo-stem (Li, Zhang, Xiong, Zheng, & Meng, 2018), chitin (Zhang et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2019), and waste paper (Lee, Teramoto, & Shiraishi, 2001). Biomass-synthesized PPs have excellent properties and can be used to prepare membranes (Zhang et al., 2018), foams (Yoshioka et al., 2013; Zhang, Li, Li, Li, & Zhang, 2014), and adhesives (Li et al., 2018). Starch is a highly abundant and economical biomass material that humans have been using for thousands of years. The high-value applications of starch have been researched and developed. Among them, corn starch has been used to synthesize PPs by the liquefaction method. Yoshioka et al. (2013) used potassium hydroxide (KOH) as a catalyst to liquefy corn starch to synthesize bio-polyols. Sulfuric acid is the traditional catalyst used to synthesize PPs from raw biomass. For example, Kosmela et al. (2019) liquefied biomass from the Baltic Sea to synthesize bio-polyols, with polyethylene glycol and glycerol as the liquefaction solvent and H2SO4 as the catalyst, Zhang et al. (2006) studied a series of liquefaction technique for liquefied cellulose with an H2SO4 catalyst, and Yoshioka et al. (2013) synthesized PPs from corn starch as the raw material and with H2SO4 as the catalyst. Although H2SO4 a good catalyst for liquefaction, as a liquid-acid catalyst it has some disadvantages, such as (i) posing a safety risk, (ii) corroding equipment, (iii) endangering the environment, (iv) wasting catalyst, and (v) being difficult to separate and recover. The aforementioned problems are serious limitations to liquefy starch with H2SO4 as a catalyst. To solve them, Liu, Guo, and Zhang (2014) reported a new process of using methyl sulfonic acid as the catalyst for preparing PPs from starch. Hara et al. (2004) reported a new strategy of synthesizing a carbon-based solid acid from various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with a high density (4.90 mmol/g) of SO3H groups. In some studies (Asawaworarit et al., 2019; Fu, Wan, Hu, Cui, & Guan, 2012; Ma et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2010, 2019), biochar-derived solid-acid catalysts (SACs) were prepared from biomass materials, which have abundant SO3H acid sites and exhibit excellent catalytic effects in some reactions. Due to these features, biochar-derived SACs are ideal materials for starch liquefaction. The process of starch liquefaction is promising to occur by cleavage of the glycosidic bonds and reaction with the liquefying solvent, under the action of biochar-derived SACs. However, so far, few studies of preparing PPs from starch with biochar-derived SACs have been reported. Spent coffee (SC) has the advantages of abundant availability, low price and convenient treatment, and is an expected candidate from which to prepare a SAC (Luz et al., 2018; Solange, Ercília, Silvia, & José, 2011). Herein, we develop a new strategy that involves preparing a biochar SAC from SC (SC-SAC) and using it as the catalyst with which to prepare starch PPs. The SC-SAC was prepared via hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) and was sulfonated with concentrated H2SO4. Furthermore, the reaction conditions for starch liquefaction, including the mass ratio of SC-SAC to corn starch, liquefaction temperature, and liquefaction time were optimized. A number of characterization techniques were used to characterize the SC-SAC. Finally, we used the starch liquefaction product (SLP) as a plaster to improve water resistance and mechanical performance of SLP/PVA films by solution casting. Schematic representation of the strategy was shown in Fig. 1 . The thermal stability, mechanical properties, structure, and water resistance properties of SLP/PVA films were systematically studied."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The SC comprised residues recovered from Starbucks Coffee Haikou Renmin Boulevard Branch. Starch was purchased from Nanjing Ganzhiyuan Sugar Co., Ltd. The H2SO4 (95–98 %) was purchased from Xilong Science Co., Ltd. The PEG-400 and PVA (1799, alcoholysis degree: 98–99 %) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. Glycerol was purchased from Guangdong Guanghua Sci-Tech Co., Ltd."
3,Preparation of SC-SAC,"2.2 Preparation of SC-SAC The SC-SAC preparation method was modified from a previously reported method (Ma et al., 2014). The SC was immersed in and washed with hot water (>353 K) and hot ethanol (>333 K) to remove impurities. SC was then added into water in a hydrothermal synthesis reactor at 453 K for 12 h. The pre-processed SC was dried and marked as S C-H TC. The S C-H TC was then treated with concentrated H2SO4 at 343 K for 10 h. The sulfonated S C-H TC was washed several times with hot pure water (>353 K) until impurities such as sulfate ions were no longer detected in the wash water. The sulfonated S C-H TC was then dried at 333 K for 24 h to obtain the SC-SAC."
4,Liquefaction of starch by SC-SAC,"2.3 Liquefaction of starch by SC-SAC The starch liquefaction method was modified based on the reported method (Liu et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2006). First, 3.0 g of starch and 18.0 g of liquefaction solvent (a 7:3 w/w mixture of PEG-400 and glycerol) were mixed at 323–403 K in a 100-mL three-necked flask equipped with a stirrer. After homogeneous mixing, 0.075–0.45 g of the SC-SAC was added to the flask. The SLP was obtained after the mixture was stirred under reflux at 423–433 K for 2 h. Having cooled down to room temperature (20–40 ℃), the resulting reaction mixture was washed with ethanol and poured into a beaker, and the solid residue was removed by filtration. The resulting solid residue was then dried in an oven at 378 K for 3 h to obtain its dry mass. Meanwhile, the filtrate was evaporated in a vacuum of 0.6 mbar at 373 K for 24 h to remove the ethanol, and the remaining liquid served as the SLP. The liquefaction yield of starch was calculated according to Eq. (1): (1) L i q u e f a c t i o n y i e l d % = 1 - d r y m a s s o f s o l i d r e s i d u e d r y m a s s o f s t a r c h × 100"
5,Preparation of SLP-plasticized PVA films,"2.4 Preparation of SLP-plasticized PVA films The SLP-plasticized PVA films were prepared by solution casting. A given amount of SLP was added to a 5% PVA solution and stirred for 1 h to produce an SLP/PVA solution; the values of the SLP-to-PVA weight ratio were 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8. Each SLP-plasticized PVA film was prepared by solution casting method. The SLP/PVA solution was poured into a glass plate under 313 K for 48 h."
6,Characterization of the samples,"2.5 Characterization of the samples 2.5.1 Structural The total acid density and the SO3H density were determined by acid-base back titration (Wu et al., 2010). The total acid density measurement: 0.5 g of SC-SAC was added to 20 mL of NaOH aqueous solution (0.01 M), and the mixture was treated ultrasonically at RT for 1 h; after filtration separation, the filtered solution was titrated by HCl aqueous solution (0.01 M) using phenolphthalein as the indicator. The SO3H density measurement: 0.05 g of SC-SAC was added to 20 mL of NaCl aqueous solution (0.01 M), and the mixture was treated ultrasonically at RT for 1 h; after filtration separation, the filtered solution was titrated by NaOH aqueous solution (0.01 M) using phenolphthalein as the indicator. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was performed on an FT-IR spectrometer (TENSOR 27; Bruker, Germany). Each spectrum was recorded over 4000–600 cm−1 at a resolution of 4 cm−1 with 32 scans. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were collected on an X-ray diffractometer (Axsd8 Advanlex; Bruker, Germany) equipped with Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 30 mA in a scanning range of 2–60°. Raman scattering spectra were recorded with a microconfocal laser Raman spectrometer (inVia Raman Microscope; Renishaw, UK) using Ar+ 514 nm laser excitation and with the power output of 10 mW. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with an excitation source of Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV). Spectra from 1H (400 MHz) and 13C (100 MHz) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements were used to analyze the SLP structure and were recorded on a 400-MHz spectrometer (Bruker). 2.5.2 Morphological Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectra, and corresponding elemental mapping were taken with a Phenom ProX SEM. 2.5.3 Thermogravimetric analysis Thermogravimetric analysis was performed using a thermal analyzer (TG 209 F3 Tarsus; NETZSCH-Gerätebau GmbH, Germany) in the temperature range of 40–800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in a nitrogen atmosphere. 2.5.4 Determination of viscosity and hydroxyl number The SLP viscosity was measured using a digital viscometer (NDJ-9SN; Shanghai Jingke, China). The SLP hydroxyl number (OHV) was determined according to ISO 14900-2001. 2.5.5 Determination of molecular weight Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was used to measure the number-average molecular weight (Mn ) and weight-average molecular weight (Mw ) of the SLP. It was performed on a Waters 1515 gel permeation chromatography system, employing two columns (Styragel HT 2 and Styragel HT 4) coupled in series. 2.5.6 Mechanical properties The tensile strength and elongation at break of the films were measured using a universal testing machine (WDW-1; Jinan Zhongzheng Testing Machine Manufacturing Co., Ltd., China) at a crosshead speed of 50 mm/min, and calculated as the average of five specimens. Each film was cut into dumbbell-shape with 75 mm × 4 mm. The average thickness of the films was measured using thickness tester (Aipli, Quzhou, China) with an accuracy of 0.01 mm at 5 different positions of each film. 2.5.7 Wettability and solubility The wettability of the films was measured using a contact angle meter (SDC-100, SINDIN, Dongguan, China), and determined by observing the water contact angle (WCA) with a 10 μL water droplet on the film surface. Water absorption capacity (Wa) and water solubility (Ws) were tested three samples for each film according to ASTM standard D570-98. The sample size and water amount were modified to 2 × 2 cm2 and 50 mL, respectively. The initial dry weight (W0) of samples was measured by oven drying at 50 ℃ for 24 h. The samples were immersed in distilled water for 24 h at RT. Then, the film samples were removed from the water, wiped dry with filter paper, and weighed as the wet weight (Wt). The Wa was calculated based on Eq. (2): (2) W a = W t - W 0 W 0 × 100 % Swollen film samples were dried in an oven at 60 ℃ for 24 h, after which they were cooled to RT in a desiccator, prior to weight the dry weight (Wd) after immersion. The Ws was calculated according to Eq. (3): (3) W S % = W 0 - W d W 0 × 100 %"
7,Statistical analysis,"2.6 Statistical analysis One-way analysis of variance was performed in Excel for multiple comparisons was performed. The OriginPro 2018 (64-bit) SR1 software (OriginLab Corporation, MA, USA) was used for the analysis of the experimental results."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterization of SC-SAC,"3.1 Characterization of SC-SAC 3.1.1 Structural characterization The total acid density and the SO3H density of the SC-SAC were measured as 4.88 and 1.68 mmol g−1, respectively, as given in Table S1. Compared with various reference catalysts (Fu et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2014), the SC-SAC contains desirable active groups and is expected to be used for the catalytic liquefaction of starch. As shown in Fig. 2 (a), the Raman spectra of the SC-SAC exhibited two distinct signals that were attributed to the D (1380 cm−1, A1g D breathing mode) and G bands (1585 cm−1, E2g G mode), which indicates the presence of polycyclic aromatic carbon sheets in the carbon bulk (Fukuhara et al., 2011; Suganuma, Nakajima, Kitano, Hayashi, & Hara, 2012). As for the S C-H TC, there was one signal that was attributed to the G band (1590 cm−1, E2g G mode) and no visible signal of the D band. This shows that before sulfonation, the polycyclic aromatic carbon sheet structure was not observed in the sample. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the XRD pattern of the S C-H TC had very weak peaks at approximately 15° and 20°, indicating that the S C-H TC had an irregular amorphous structure. After sulfonation, the peak at 15° disappeared completely and a broad peak at 22° attributed to graphitic (002) layers was observed for the SC-SAC. The chemical composition of the SC, S C-H TC, and SC-SAC surface was characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy, shown in Fig. 3 (a). For SC and S CH TC, the peaks at 3450, 2930 cm―1 assigned to OH and CH. The peaks at 1640 and 1380 cm―1 were attributed to the stretching vibrations of CC and aromatic CO, respectively. Among them, the major difference was seen between the peaks at 1380 cm―1. Compared with SC, the intensity of peak at 1380 cm―1 of SC–HTC was significantly weakened. This was due to the degradation of aromatic compounds. For the SC-SAC, the addition of a weak peak at 1705 cm―1 was attributed to the CO groups. The new peaks at 1185 and 1030 cm―1 were attributed to the SO3H groups of the SC-SAC. The results show that sulfonic groups were introduced into the SC-SAC. Next, we characterized the surface composition and chemical state of the constituent elements of the S C-H TC and SC-SAC by XPS [Fig. 3(c)–(f)]. In Fig. 3(c), the peaks at 532 and 285 eV were attributed to O 1s and C 1s, respectively, of the COOH groups. The peak at 168 eV was attributed to S 2p of the SO3H groups. The O 1s spectrum of the S C-H TC [Fig. 3(d)] showed two clearly defined peaks of CO at 531.8 eV and CO at 533.0 eV. The O 1s spectrum of the SC-SAC [Fig. 3(d)] showed two clearly defined peaks of CO and SO3H at 531.8 eV and CO at 533.4 eV. The C 1s spectrum [Fig. 3(e)] showed four defined peaks of OCO at 288.8 eV, CO at 287.8 eV, CO at 286.3 eV, and CC/CC (the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on the carbon skeleton) at 284.8 eV. The peaks of OCO and CO evidently increased in the SC-SAC, which was because of oxidation SC–HTC during sulfonation. The S 2p spectrum [Fig. 3(f)] showed two defined peaks of S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 at 168.2 eV and 169.4 eV of the SO3H groups. The XPS results showed that sulfur atoms were bonded covalently with the S C-H TC. 3.1.2 Morphological characterization We used SEM images to characterize the surface morphologies of the SC–HTC and SC-SAC. The SEM results in Fig. 4 (a) and (b) showed that the surfaces of the SC–HTC and SC-SAC particles were irregularly shaped powders, with the SC-SAC being finer than the SC–HTC. We then used EDS and elemental mapping to analyze the elemental composition of the samples [Fig. 4(c)–(g)]. These indicate that after sulfonation, S was distributed evenly on the surface of the SC-SAC. Combining the FT-IR and XPS data, we conclude that the sulfonyl groups were distributed uniformly on the surface of the SC-SAC. 3.1.3 Thermal properties Fig. 5 (a) and (c) show the results of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermogravimetry (DTG), respectively, applied to the SC–HTC and SC-SAC. All the samples exhibited multistep degradation. The thermal properties of the materials were analyzed under an N2 atmosphere, all the samples were dried adequately at 110 °C, and the initial mass loss that occurred at 50–150 °C was attributed to the volatilization of water and low-molecular-weight compounds (Jumaidin, Sapuan, Jawaid, Ishak, & Sahari, 2017; Sanyang, Sapuan, Jawaid, Ishak, & Sahari, 2015). The decomposition of the SC–HTC was attributed to the maximum thermal degradation that occurred at 250–400 °C in two main steps. Meanwhile, the decomposition of the SC-SAC was attributed to two thermal degradation steps that occurred at 200–300 °C and 350–550 °C. Here, the SC-SAC curves differed markedly from the SC–HTC ones. The SC-SAC mass loss that occurred at 200–300 °C was attributed to the thermal decomposition of the SO3H groups therein, which decomposed to sulfur dioxide (Hara et al., 2004; Peng, Zhang, Wang, Lv, & Yu, 2005). The other SC-SAC mass loss that occurred at 350–550 °C was attributed to the thermal decomposition of the samples. The SC-SAC weight loss was much less than the SC–HTC one, and the values of temperature at mass loss of 30 wt% (T −30wt%) and temperature at maximum degradation rate (Td ) for the SC-SAC were higher than those for the SC–HTC [Table S2]. This indicated that the SC-SAC was more thermally stable than the SC–HTC."
10,Characterization of SLP,"3.2 Characterization of SLP 3.2.1 Optimization of liquefaction conditions Herein, we examined how the liquefaction time and temperature and the SC-SAC-to-starch mass ratio affect the liquefaction yield. As shown in Fig. 6 (a), at the temperature of T = 423 K, the liquefaction yield reached 95 % at 1.5 h of the liquefaction process, whereas almost no residue was left at 0.5 h at the temperature of 433 K. Therefore, a liquefaction temperature of 433 K was chosen to research how the SC-SAC-to-starch mass ratio affects the liquefaction [Fig. 6(b)]. The optimal SC-SAC amount was chosen to be 10 % mass ratio of starch. 3.2.2 Evaluation of molecular weight The SLP molecular weight was evaluated via GPC. Based on the analysis, the values of Mn and Mw for the SLP were 4623 and 8783 Da, respectively. We then measured the viscosity of the SLP as being 1.427 Pa·s. A sample of SLP was extracted to measure the OHV and acid value, as they are important parameters of PPs, which were 335.44 and 0.34 mg KOH/g, respectively. 3.2.3 Structural characterization The 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of the SLP are shown in Fig. 7 (a) and (b). The peaks at 3.6 and 4.7 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum were the typical chemical shifts of the starch backbone: methylidyne and methylene protons (CH-O and CH2-O). The peak at 4.5 ppm was attributed to the methylidyne proton (OCHO). The peaks at 72, 71.7, and 69.5 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum were attributed to the methylidyne carbon (CH), the peaks at 62.5 and 60 ppm are attributed to the methylene carbon (CH2). This result showed the SLP had ether bonds, proving that the SLP was PP. Fig. 7(c) shows the proposed reaction pathway for starch liquefied by the SC-SAC. The component structures of starch and the SLP were analyzed by FT-IR spectroscopy, shown in Fig. 4. For starch and SLP, the peaks at approximately 3400 and 2897 cm−1 belonged to OH and CH groups, respectively. The strong peak at 1100 cm−1 of SLP was attributed to the ether bond (COC). By contrast, there was no strong ether bond in the FT-IR spectrum of starch. These results showed that PPs was synthesized successfully by the liquefaction of starch. 3.2.4 Reusability of SC-SAC Next, we study the recyclability and reusability of the SC-SAC for catalytic starch liquefaction. After the first liquefaction reaction run at 443 K for 2 h, anhydrous ethanol was added to the reaction mixture to filter out the SC-SAC and any unreacted starch. After drying and adding starch, the liquefaction residue was used directly for another reaction at 443 K. This recycling process was repeated three times, and the results showed that the catalyst was still active in each run, although the liquefaction yield decreased gradually from 86.41 % (run 2) to 77.36 % (run 3) to 54.85 % (run 4). To explore what caused this decreased activity, we measured the SO3H density on the catalyst after running 4 and found it to be obviously lower (∼0.94 mmol g−1) than that with the fresh catalyst (∼1.68 mmol g−1), indicating that some of the SO3H groups had been lost from the catalyst’s surface under stirring. The blocking of SO3H groups by adsorbed reactants and/or products and the unavoidable loss of catalyst during the recycling are also the causes of the decreased catalytic performance."
11,Properties of blended films,"3.3 Properties of blended films It is possible to mix SLP with PVA to prepare SLP/PVA films (Zhang et al., 2018). Such blended films were prepared with different weight ratios of SLP blended into the PVA. The addition of SLP at different ratios caused different thickness between 0.10 and 0.13 mm [Table S3]. It displayed that the films with higher SLP ratios had higher thickness values. This is because the interactions between the SLP and PVA molecules prevented the extended of SLP/PVA films during the drying of films, and with the ratios of SLP in the SLP/PVA films increased, the solid substance in films formed after drying increased. Photographs of the SLP/PVA films are shown in Fig. 8 (a)–(e). To show the transparency of films, we painted colored streaks on white paper and covered colored streaks with films. The colored streaks can be seen clearly through the blended SLP/PVA films, showing that the films had good transparency. Remarkably, the SLP/PVA films were foldable and under folding-unfolding cycles [Fig. 9 (f)], demonstrating the films to have good transparency and excellent flexibility. The films were frozen using liquid nitrogen and broken to observe the cross‐section morphologies using SEM [Fig. 8(f)–(j)]. The pure PVA film [Fig. 8(f)] has a rough cross-section and a dense texture, whereas the 0.2 SLP/PVA film [Fig. 8(g)] has a denser fault structure, the formation of which may be related to the increased binding between the SLP and the PVA. Meanwhile, the 0.4 SLP/PVA film [Fig. 8(h)] contains tightly packed particles, the 0.6 SLP/PVA film [Fig. 8(i)] has phase separation and obvious cracks in its cross-section, and the 0.8 SLP/PVA film [Fig. 8(j)] has phase separation, pores in its cross-section, and structural heterogeneity. This evident fracture-surface morphology might have been caused by self-assembly of redundant SLP. As shown in Fig. 5(b) and (d), the thermal stability of the films described in Section 2.4 was examined using TGA and DTG analyses. To remove the moisture in the samples, the films were pre-dried in an oven at 60 °C for 24 h. The curves in Fig. 5(b) and (d) exhibit two mass-loss steps, namely (i) decomposition of the PVA and SLP side chains at 200–400 °C and (ii) breakage of the PVA and SLP backbones at 400–480 °C, with the main weight loss taking place in the first stage. The TGA data in Table S2 show that the T −30wt% and the first maximum degradation temperature (Td ) of the SLP/PVA blended films all increased initially and then decreased with increasing SLP content. When the SLP concentration was 4%, T −30wt% (307.2 °C) and the first Td (338.3 °C) of the blended films reached their maximum values. The second Td of the blended films was in the range of 425–435 °C, indicating that the blended films have identical backbones. The SLP/PVA blended films were clearly much more thermally stable than the PVA film. The wettability of pure PVA film and different ratios of SLP/PVA films was studied by static WAC measurements. As shown in Fig. 9, the WAC of the pure PVA film surface was 61.77°, meanwhile, the WAC of the films surface decreased from 22.62° to 10.68° with the ratios of SLP increased in the SLP/PVA films. It implied that the SLP/PVA films were more hydrophilic than pure PVA film. To further characterize the water resistance properties of SLP/PVA films, we performed Ws and Wa measurement. As shown in Fig. 9(g), the Ws of SLP/PVA films were higher than that of pure PVA film, and increased with increasing ratio of SLP addition in SLP/PVA films. However, the Wa unusually decreased with increasing ratio of SLP addition in SLP/PVA films. This is because the SLP/PVA films had good water solubility, and were dissolved in water after immersed in water for 24 h. The results show that the addition of SLP is beneficial to improve the hydrophilicity, water solubility and degradation of SLP/PVA films. The tensile strength and elongation at break of the SLP/PVA films were measured to characterize the mechanical properties of the films [Fig. 10 (a) and (b)]. From Fig. 6, the pure PVA film showing high tensile strength (51.72 MPa) and low elongation at break (454 %). The results show that adding the SLP reduced the tensile strength of the films slightly but greatly increased their elongation at break. The elongation properties of SLP/PVA film came to 1199 % when the ratio of SLP/PVA was 0.4, which was an increase of 164 % compared to the pure PVA film (454 %). This was due to the hydrogen bond interaction between SLP and PVA weaker than the PVA intermolecular hydrogen bond interaction. However, the elongation at break slightly declined when the ratio of SLP/PVA was higher than 0.4. This happened because of excess SLP leaded to phase separation, obvious cracks, and pores in the internal structure observed in SEM images of the SLP/PVA films. The optimal ratio of SLP/PVA for preparing films was considered to be 0.4, in which ratio film the elongation at break were increased by 164 % and the tensile strength reached 38.07 MPa."
12,Conclusion,"Starch was liquefied successfully to PPs using SC-SAC as the catalyst, thereby providing a feasible method for starch liquefaction by a biomass SAC. FT-IR, EDS, and XPS data suggested that the SC-SAC surfaces were successfully modified by SO3H groups. The Mw , viscosity, OHV, and acid values of the PPs were 8783 Da, 1.43 Pa·s, and 335.44 and 0.34 mg KOH/g, respectively. The SLP improved the mechanical properties of the SLP/PVA films, showed good transparency and flexibility, thereby demonstrating good potential for the application of modifying composite materials. The composite materials are suitable for application as packaging materials for food, clothing, cosmetics, and medical industries."
