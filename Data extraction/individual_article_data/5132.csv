0,Introduction,"Mixtures of higher alcohols are known as interesting blend stocks for motor gasoline. The addition of oxygenates, such as alcohols and ethers, into gasoline gives rise to decreased toxic exhaust gases (CO, NO x ) and in some cases increased octane number. As a part of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the use of reformed gasoline requiring a minimum of 2.0% oxygenate has been mandated by the United States Congress to be used in cities with high level of air pollutants [1]. Therefore, the selective production of oxygenated compounds remains one of the main goals of syntheses from carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Methanol synthesis carried out over both low temperature and pressure (250°C, 750–1000psi, Cu/ZnO/M2O3, M=Al, Cr) and high temperature and pressure (400°C, 1500–3000psi, ZnO/Cr2O3) from syngas is a large scale industrial process [2–4]. Based on these catalysts, several other processes are under investigation. Among those, the synthesis of higher alcohols has been performed over both low- and high-temperature catalysts doped with alkali metal ions in order to shift the synthesis away from methanol towards higher alcohols [4–9]. Modified Fischer–Tropsch [3], group VIII metal-based catalysts [10,11] and developed Mo-catalysts [12] have been extensively investigated in catalysis for the development of active and selective alcohol synthesis catalysts. The catalysts based on Co–Cu reported by IFP (Institut Français du Pétrole) showed high activity and good selectivity toward higher alcohols [13]. These catalysts were such that neighboring cobalt and copper ions in the spinel structure remaining at atomic distance from each other in the reduced catalyst constituted the active center for the alcohol synthesis [13]. It is thus likely that using other mixed oxides comprising both Co and Cu may be interesting catalyst precursors. Traditional ABO3 perovskite-type mixed oxides have been known as catalysts or catalyst precursors for several oxidation/reduction reactions [14,15]. A large number of natural and synthetic compounds have the perovskite structure in which the A and B positions can be occupied by a broad range of metal cations in different oxidation states [16]. The ideal perovskite structure is cubic with space group Pm3m-Oh [16–18]; distortions owing to ionic size requirements of the structure can, however, give rise to modified structures, usually by tilting or twisting of the octahedra [19]. Such distortions make larger unit cells and accommodate reduction in symmetry. The crystal structure of perovskite materials is very tolerant to changes in the radii of A and B cations and could accommodate a large concentration in cation vacancies particularly at the A site. This allows a great flexibility in mixing A and B cations to obtain several desired physical chemical properties [16,18,20,21]. The large variety of properties displayed by perovskite oxides is due to the ability of the framework to accommodate cations of various sizes and valences and to tolerance towards anionic and cationic vacancies. In general, the catalytic activity of perovskite compounds is essentially controlled by the B-site metal, the effect of rare earth ion in the A site is usually meager [14,16,17,22]. Moreover, complex perovskites where both A and B sites are replaced by other elements in order to produce numerous derivatives of AA′BB′O3 type have received much attention in catalysis [17,20,21,23]. The effect of a partial substitution of the B cation ( A B 1 − x B ′ x O 3 ) on the catalytic properties has been much less investigated because of difficulties in preparing the complex perovskites from elements with different radius and valence. For instance, Porta et al. [23] reported that the presence of a single perovskite phase of LaCo1−x Cu x O3 was solely obtained at relatively high calcination temperature (≥800°C) with x <0.4. At higher concentration of copper (x ≥0.4), the appearance of LaCu2O4 phase in addition to the LaCo1−x Cu x O3 perovskite could not be avoided. Nevertheless, these perovskites do exhibit several interesting features as precursors for supported metal catalysts. For instance, the reduction under controlled reduction treatments of LnBO3 (B=Mn, Ni, Co, Fe, Rh, …) can produce a well-dispersed transition metal B on a matrix comprising a Ln2O3 support. Such catalysts were paid much attention for water gas shift reaction, partial oxidation of methane [14], reforming of carbon dioxide [24], alkene hydrogenation, alkane hydrogenolysis, [25], and Fischer–Tropsch synthesis [26], as well as higher alcohol synthesis [10,27]. However, the applications of these perovskite-type oxides as catalysts or catalyst precursors are limited due to the difficulties in obtaining high surface area owing to the high calcination temperatures during their preparation. It should be kept in mind that the preparative recipe plays an important role in the physical and chemical properties of the reaction products, governing the structure, morphology, and surface area of the obtained materials [18,19,27–31]. Compared to the conventional methods, reactive grinding allows to prepare perovskite-type mixed oxides at rather low temperatures and yields a relatively high surface area [28,30–32]. In previous publications [31,33–36], we presented a series of perovskites prepared by mechano-synthesis from their corresponding component oxides and their catalytic activity in various oxidation reactions. This article provides several further characterizations and reports a novel applicability of reactive LaCoO3 perovskites partially substituted by copper as catalyst precursors for the synthesis of hydrocarbons and higher alcohols from syngas."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts A series of LaCo1−x Cu x O3−δ (0≤ x ≤0.6) perovskite-type mixed oxides was synthesized by high-energy ball milling directly from the oxide precursors. Commercial lanthanum, copper, and cobalt oxides with purity of 99% or better, obtained from Aldrich, were weighed in stoichiometric proportions and blended together. A typical charge of 5g blended raw materials together with three hardened steel balls of 11mm in diameter were charged in a 50ml hardened steel crucible. Then, the crucible was closed under air and fixed on the mill arm. An O-ring was placed between the crucible and the screw cap in order to keep the crucible hermetically sealed. A SPEX high-energy ball mill operating at 1000rpm was used for mechano-synthesis. Milling was carried out for 8h prior to a second milling step with additives. In the second milling step, the resulting powder was mixed to 50% NaCl (99.9%) and milled under the same conditions in order to reach a better dispersion and higher specific surface area. The secondary milling was carried out for 12h before washing the NaCl additive with distilled water. Two leaching operations were performed in order to remove the additive. The slurry was then dried and calcined at the desired temperature. The LaCo1−x Cu x O3−δ samples prepared by reactive grinding are designated below as N0–N6 (Table 1 ). A reference sample, LaCoO3 +5.0wt.% Cu2O designated as M1, was prepared by grinding a mixture of the ground perovskite LaCoO3 having a specific surface area of 43m2/g with Cu2O oxide (10:1 molar ratio) at ambient temperature without any grinding additive before drying at 120°C overnight in oven."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The chemical analysis (La, Co, Cu) of the perovskites and the residual impurities was performed by atomic absorption spectroscopy using a Perkin-Elmer 1100B spectrometer. Prior to each analysis, an exact amount of sample was digested in 10% HCl solution at 60–70°C overnight. The specific surface area of all obtained samples was determined by nitrogen adsorption (BET method) isotherms recorded at −196°C using a computer-controlled sorption analyzer (OMNISORB 100). One hundred to 300mg of each sample was degassed at 200°C for 6–8h in order to remove the humidity prior to N2 adsorption measurements. Phase analysis and particle size determination were performed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a SIEMENS D5000 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.54059nm). Bragg's angles between 15° and 75° were collected at a rate of 1°/min. Average particle sizes (D) were evaluated by means of the Debye–Scherrer equation D = Kλ/β cos θ after Warren's correction for instrumental broadening [37]. K is a constant equal to 0.89; λ the wavelength of the X-ray used; β the effective linewidth of the X-ray reflection under observation, calculated by the equation β 2 = B 2 − b 2 [wherein B is the full width at half-maximum (FWHM), b the instrumental broadening determined through the FWHM of the X-ray reflection at 2θ ≈28° of SiO2 having particles larger than 1000Å]; θ the diffraction angle of the plane considered X-ray reflection. SEM images were recorded on a JEOL JSM-840 with magnification of 25,000. Acceleration voltage was 10kV. The samples were dispersed on an aluminum stub and coated with Au//Pt film. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of oxygen and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were carried out using a flow system (RXM-100), a multifunctional catalyst testing and characterization apparatus (Advanced Scientific Designs Inc.). The reactor was connected to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (UTI 100) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). For TPD experiments, 40–50mg of catalyst was ramped at 10°C/min up to the calcination temperature (500°C) under 20vol.% O2/He (20ml/min) for 90min and then cooled down to room temperature under a flow of 20ml/min He for 1h in order to remove the physically adsorbed species. The O2-TPD conditions were 20ml/min He, temperature from 25 to 900°C (5°C/min). The m/z signals 18, 32, 44 were also collected using the mass spectrometer to monitor the desorption process. Prior to each TPR analysis, a 40–50mg sample was calcined for 90min under flowing 20% O2/He (20ml/min, ramp 5°C/min) at 500°C and then evacuated under high vacuum (<10−7 Torr) at 400°C for 90min in order to remove the adsorbed oxygen. Then, the sample was cooled down to room temperature under flowing pure He (20ml/min). TPR of the catalysts was then carried out by ramping under 4.65vol.% of H2/Ar (20ml/min) from room temperature up to 800°C (5°C/min). The hydrogen consumption was determined using a TCD with the reference gas of the same composition as the reducing gas (H2/Ar). The effluent gas was passed through a cold trap (dry ice/ethanol) in order to remove water prior to the detector."
4,Catalytic activity,"2.3 Catalytic activity The catalytic tests were carried out in a stainless-steel continuous fixed-bed flow micro-reactor (BTRS-Jr PC, Autoclave Engineers). The reaction pressure was controlled using a back-pressure regulator, in the range of 0–2500psi. The syngas mixture (H2/CO=2/1) was diluted (20vol.%) in either nitrogen or helium. The mixture of reactants and inert gas was supplied from a pressurized manifold via individual mass flow controllers. The catalyst pellet size was 40 mesh. Catalysts were pretreated in situ under flowing 15vol.% of H2/N2 (20ml/min) prior to each reaction test. The temperature was kept at 180°C (5h), 300°C (5h), 420°C (5h) and 525°C (5h) with a ramp of 2°C/min. Then, the reactor was cooled down to the reaction temperature while pressure was increased to 1000psi by feeding inert gas before switching to the reaction mixture. Butane/helium (4.98vol.%) was used as an internal calibration standard. The products were analyzed using a gas chromatograph equipped with two capillary columns and an automated online gas sampling valve maintained at 170°C. The temperature of transfer line between the reactor and the valves was kept at 220°C in order to avoid any product condensation. Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide were separated using a capillary column (Carboxen™ 1006 PLOT, 30m×0.53mm) connected to the TCD. Quantitative analysis of all organic products was carried out using the second capillary column (Wcot fused silica, 60m×0.53mm, Coating Cp-Sil 5CB, DF=5.00μm) connected to a FID detector (Varian CP-3800) and mass spectrometer (Varian Saturn 2200 GC/MS/MS)."
5,Results,
6,Catalyst characteristics,"3.1 Catalyst characteristics The characteristics of the catalysts used including surface area, particle size, and chemical composition are summarized in Table 1. The BET surface area shows relatively high values ranging from 10 to 60m2/g, owing to the low temperature synthesis, which allows to avoid the agglomeration of perovskite particles. X-ray patterns of ground samples are reported in Fig. 1 . These spectra compared with JCPDS (Nos. 48-0123 and 81-2124) display strong reflections of perovskite-type mixed oxides. However, a small shift of diffraction lines in XRD patterns to lower 2θ values was observed for a set of LaCo1−x Cu x O3−δ samples. This can be explained by a small difference of the atomic radii between cobalt (1.25Å) and copper (1.28Å), which results in a small change in unit cell of perovskite lattice [23,29], as shown in Table 2 . X-ray diffractions revealed that the twin peaks (110)–(104) at 2θ ≈33.30° for rhombohedral LaCoO3 [38], shift to lower diffraction angle (2θ ≈32.80°) for LaCo0.7Cu0.3O3−δ . However, for compositions with x ≥0.5, the appearance of the reflections belonging to Co3O4 and CuO indicates the presence of small amounts of these compounds besides the LaCo1−x Cu x O3 perovskite phase. In addition, all ground samples of N0–N6 always contained a small amount of iron oxide contaminant in spite of no FeO x species being detected by XRD (Table 1). In terms of FWHM, the formation of nanometric perovskite crystals by reactive grinding of the single oxides was observed. Fig. 2 shows that the fresh perovskite N3 (a typical example of the ground materials) is composed of platelet-shape particles of micron-size. Such catalyst particles consist of several fine primary grains with average diameter of 9–12nm as determined from X-ray line broadening. This is in good agreement with the results reported for the formation of nanocrystalline perovskites by the mechano-synthesis process [28,30,31,39,40]."
7,Redox behavior,"3.2 Redox behavior 3.2.1 Temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen The O2-TPD profiles (m/z =32) of LaCo1−x Cu x O3−δ are shown in Fig. 3 . In agreement with some previous results [31,35,36,39], all samples display two prominent characteristic peaks with maxima centered around 540 and 790°C. The first peak, often referred to as α-oxygen, is ascribed to oxygen species adsorbed on the perovskite surface. The higher temperature desorption peak (710–820°C), β-oxygen, is associated with the release of oxygen from the bulk of the solid. This corresponds to the reduction of Co3+, (Fe3+), Cu2+ to lower oxidation states. In particular, O2-TPD spectrum for sample N1 shows a small shoulder at 748°C and a sharp β-peak at 789°C. Except for the LaCoO3 sample, the oxygen signal (m/z =32) is found not to reach the baseline at the final temperature of 900°C, level indicating that the liberation of oxygen is still occurring. Moreover, the desorption peak temperatures were found to shift with increasing x values [41,42]. As Cu substitution increases in LaCo1−x Cu x O3−δ , it is expected to create more oxygen vacancy in lattice and therefore the amount of desorbing oxygen increases. The amount of oxygen desorbed, calculated from deconvoluted oxygen peaks, is given in Table 3 . 3.2.2 Temperature-programmed reduction Temperature-programmed reduction profiles of LaCo1−x Cu x O3−δ samples N0 to N3 are displayed in Fig. 4 . It is known from literature that the reduction temperature and process are strongly dependant on the catalyst preparation, chemical composition, structure, and morphology [16,17,21,26]. For LaCoO3, there are two visible peaks, one centered at 400°C with a small shoulder at 439°C and the other positioned at 630–670°C. At low temperatures, the reduction process was attributed to the reduction of Co3+ to Co2+. The complete reduction of Co2+ to Co0 takes place at higher temperatures, in good agreement with the results reported by several groups [14,17,19,21,26,43,44]. A similar reduction behavior is also observed for Cu-substituted samples. TPR curves of LaCo1−x Cu x O3−δ perovskites show a set of main peaks in the temperature range from 200 to 575°C. For example, LaCo0.7Cu0.3O3−δ sample (N3) shows three peaks with maxima at 311, 440 and 550°C. Moreover, in all TPR experiments with Cu containing catalysts, contrary to what was observed with Cu free perovskite, the baseline was completely recovered at 640°C showing that the reduction is essentially terminated at that temperature. The H2 balance provides evidence of the reduction of Co3+and Cu2+ occurring in various steps, from Co3+ and Cu2+ to Co2+ and Cu0 at 310–380°C and from Co2+ to Co0 at 380–540°C. In order to illustrate the cobalt and copper phases formed in the reduction process, X-ray patterns of sample N3 reduced at 375 and 450°C for 90min are shown in Fig. 5 . Upon reduction at 375°C the main diffraction peak at θ ≈33° is very broad and shifts to lower 2θ values indicating that the structure converted to the orthorhombic structure of La2(Co0.75Cu0.25)O4.2 perovskite (JCPDS card 82-1942), in addition to LaCoO3 (JCPDS card 48-0123) and metallic copper (JCPDS 04-0836). This is in agreement with the results of Sis and Wirtz [44] who observed changes in the structure of LaCoO3 from rhombohedral symmetry to monoclinic during the reduction step of Co3+/Co2+ up to 400°C. Moreover, the appearance of La2(Co0.75Cu0.25)O4±σ demonstrates that the parent perovskite is partially modified due to the elimination of cations from the B site [14,26,44]. Compared to the XRD spectrum of the fresh perovskite, the lines of the reduced phase are broad indicating the formation of a more dispersed nanophase. Upon reduction at 450°C for 90min, the perovskite structure is destroyed producing a well-dispersed metallic phase on La2O3 (Fig. 5). Diffraction lines of copper at 2θ =43.3°; 50.4° (JCPDS card 04-0836) and cobalt at 2θ =44.2°; 51.6° (JCPDS card 15-0806) are attributed to metallic phases with face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice. Obviously, the presence of copper in the perovskite lattice promoted cobalt reduction. The effect of copper on cobalt reducibility in the present catalyst composition is supported by the result obtained on a reference sample prepared by grinding a blend of LaCoO3 perovskite with Cu2O. XRD patterns of this sample (not shown) revealed the presence of a physical mixture of LaCoO3 and Cu2O (2θ =36.9°, 42.6°). The TPR of Cu2O/LaCoO3 sample shows various peaks with maxima at 290, 400, 506 and 740°C (Fig. 6 ). From this figure several observations can be made. First the TPR profile of this blend (sample M1) is noticeably different from the one of the perovskites (sample N0 to N3 in Fig. 4) The line close to 400°C is associated with the reduction of copper oxide yielding metallic copper which accelerates the reduction of lattice cobalt. Secondly the close resemblance between the TPR profiles of copper rich perovskite samples (N5 and N6) with the one of sample M1 clearly indicated that at least of fraction of copper is present as extra-framework copper oxide in these two samples. This result is indeed confirmed by the XRD patterns in Fig. 1."
8,Catalytic performance,"3.3 Catalytic performance The perovskite samples have been tested as catalysts for syngas conversion showing that LaCo1−x Cu x O3−δ produced a mixture of linear alcohols and hydrocarbons. The selectivities to products reported in Fig. 7 indicate that the reaction was quite complex due to the occurrence of several parallel reactions including Fischer–Tropsch synthesis of hydrocarbons, alcohol synthesis and water-gas-shift reaction (WGS). Fig. 8 shows the CO conversion obtained under the same experimental conditions with all samples in this study. The overall CO conversion is believed to be proportional to the metal surface area of the pretreated samples. This metal surface area is highly dependant on the morphology of ground samples (see Ref. [43]) so that the mere comparison of specific activity cannot be done on the basis of these conversions alone. Thus the selectivity data reported in Fig. 7 are considered more meaningful. The hydrocarbon as well as alcohol products obtained with all catalysts all show Anderson–Schulz–Flory carbon number distributions. An example of such distributions is reported in Fig. 9 for sample N3. The comparison of selectivity observed with samples N0 to N3 indicates that increasing the lattice Cu content leads to a clear increase in alcohol (C2 +OH) selectivity. Simultaneously the methane and C2 + hydrocarbon selectivities decrease. In absence of copper in the perovskite lattice (sample N0) the unexpected result of a rather high alcohol production was observed. Metallic cobalt is indeed known as a good Fischer–Tropsch catalyst but is usually not considered active in higher alcohol synthesis [9,45,46]. In the case of this catalyst the promotion of cobalt metal activity might be obtained from the fact that Co is supported on an amorphous La2O3 phase, this oxide having basic properties. It is indeed also known that a Fischer–Tropsch metal catalyst can yield alcohols when promoted with a base [9,13,45,47,48]. Then the selectivities obtained with samples M1, N5 and N6 must indeed be compared with those of the pure Co perovskite (sample N0). This comparison suggests that in the three catalysts some Cu has indeed been inserted in the LaCoO3 lattice increasing slightly their alcohol selectivities. Fig. 10 gives the values of overall alcohol productivity in the above reported conditions. The largest value, although still modest was obtained for sample N3 where 30% of the cobalt is substituted with copper. With this catalyst a productivity close to 50mg/gcat/h corresponding to 49.5wt.% alcohols in the products excluding CO2 was obtained. In this case the alcohol chain growth probability (α) was found to be 0.38 (see Fig. 9). Usually the catalytic tests reported in Figs. 7–10 were lasting for 10h with no significant changes in conversions or selectivities. In the case of sample N3 a test run in the conditions reported in Fig. 7 was conducted for 48h with no measurable changes in activity."
9,Discussion,"Copper and cobalt mixed perovskites were considered in this study because it was believed that upon reduction they would yield supported well-dispersed copper/cobalt metallic alloys. The general consensus in literature is that a metallic copper atom should be within atomic distance of a cobalt atom in the alloy in order to create a catalytic site for higher alcohol synthesis from syngas [5–8,13,16,26,49,50]. The first requirement for the perovskite precursor is therefore that Cu2+ should indeed be in the B sites of the LaCo1−x Cu x O3−δ lattice. Such substitution may be monitored either by XRD or through the modifications of their thermal and catalytic properties. All XRD patterns in Fig. 1 show the presence of a perovskite phase in agreement with the patterns for Cu–Co perovskite-type oxides reported in [23,29]. A clear increase in d spacing is observed for sample N0–N3 (see Table 2). This is in good agreement with the linear increase in lattice parameters of LaCoO3 upon substitution of Co with Cu observed by Porta et al. [23] and Ramaswamy et al. [29]. O2-TPD data also indicate clearly that in sample N0–N3 the copper ions are essentially in lattice. The substitution of Co3+ by Cu2+ results in a positive charge deficiency which is compensated by oxygen vacancies. An increase in surface oxygen vacancies yields a higher surface concentration of α-oxygen as observed in the TPD profiles of Fig. 3. Moreover the increased lattice oxygen mobility associated with the inclusion of Cu2+ yields the appearance of a lower temperature β1-oxygen desorption (Fig. 3) [21]. The TPR results also show a significantly different reduction behavior between extra- and intra-lattice copper perovskites. The observation on the reduction of samples N0–N3 clearly supports the XRD conclusion that copper could replace about 30% of the cobalt in the perovskite structure. Increasing copper lattice content was found to yield a systematic shift in cobalt reduction temperature in the TPR curve (Fig. 4). As copper and cobalt sites are atomically distributed in the perovskite lattice, the interaction between such ions could affect their reducibility. Two successive reduction processes of Cu2+/Cu0 and Co3+/Co2+ and even some Co2+/Co0 take place between 310 and 380°C (Fig. 4). The corresponding extraction of Cu0 atoms from the framework results in a change in perovskite structure and greatly enhances the reduction of Co2+/Co0 (Fig. 5). Such Cu0 metal acts as a catalyst for hydrogen dissociation thus providing atomic hydrogen which facilitates reduction of cobalt ions [13,21,47,50,51]. Accordingly, cobalt ions, particularly those located in the grain boundaries, are reduced at a significantly lower temperature. This is consistent with the observation of LaCoO3 reduction reported by Lombardo and Tanaka [52] who indicated that at the starting reduction step of Co2+/Co0, the surface is more rapidly reduced than the bulk. Surface conversion of metallic cobalt could reach up to 100% after reduction of LaCoO3 at 450°C for 10min. The low reduction temperature of both surface ions in Cu–Co based perovskites should facilitate the formation of an alloy. This suggestion was substantiated by XRD data. The appearance of small diffraction lines (2θ =43.70°; 44.12°) between 43.28° and 44.24° in Fig. 5 corresponding to the lattice parameters (fcc) of 3.58 and 3.55Å that are less than the lattice spacing (a 0 =3.615Å) for copper cubic crystal (JCPDS card 04-0836) but more than that (a 0 =3.545Å) for cobalt (JCPDS card 15-0806) is believed to characterize the presence of Cu–Co alloys. This is in accordance with the results of Bedel et al. [53] who reported that the partial reduction of LaCo0.40Fe0.60O3 perovskite produced small particles of Co–Fe alloy. In contrast to the Cu2+ species in perovskite lattice, the extra-lattice CuO was reduced around 400°C as an individual component (samples N5, N6 and M1 in Fig. 6). XRD data show perovskite lattice, but the H2-TPR curves of samples N5 and N6 did not show the regular profiles corresponding to Cu–Co based perovskite as observed with samples N0–N3. Therefore, trying to incorporate a higher copper content into perovskite lattice (x ≥0.4) resulted in a mixture of oxides and perovskites [23]. The catalytic results show that the nanocrystalline perovskites are capable of producing higher alcohols up to C7 and hydrocarbons up to C11 from syngas. It is noted that methanol is not the major alcohol product though the methanol synthesis is thermodynamically favored compared with that of other alcohols [13,54]. In this study, the fraction of higher alcohol is still modest. The analysis of the products allows, however, to reach some insight into the role of the copper–cobalt metal sites. From the results shown in Fig. 7 for samples N0–N3, the selectivity to higher alcohols is dependant on the content of intra-lattice copper in the perovskite. The increase in selectivity to C2 +OH with increasing substitution of Co3+ by Cu2+ is observed up to x ≈0.3. The modest increase in methanol fraction in the product (3–4%) in samples N5, N6, and M1 compared to N0–N3 might be associated to activity of extra-framework Cu phase. Copper is known to be active in methanol synthesis [2,3,27]. Its ability to dissociate hydrogen which reacts with chemisorbed CO is responsible for this catalytic effect. Under higher alcohol synthesis conditions, the adsorbed CO molecule is inserted in the alkyl chain group on a neighboring Co atom, instead of being hydrogenated to form methanol [13,47,50]. Both hydrocarbons and alcohols show product distributions essentially in agreement with Anderson–Schulz–Flory distribution (Fig. 9). The chain growth propagation factors for normal alkanes are in the range α =0.37–0.45. Fig. 9 is a representative example of the ASF distributions obtained in both cases. It is observed on this figure that the α value for alcohols is slightly lower (α =0.38) when the whole alcohol distribution is considered in its estimation. It is however remarkable that this difference is mostly associated to high values of methanol (n =1) and ethanol (n =2) which as discussed above may be associated to the catalytic effect of extra lattice copper phases. Fig. 9 also shows that if the two points, n =1, n =2 in the alcohol molecular distribution are ignored the observed ASF slope is much closer to the one of hydrocarbons (α ≈0.44). From these very similar α values, it is confirmed that the reaction more likely takes place via sequential insertion of CH x intermediates in order to propagate the carbon chain."
10,Conclusions,"A set of LaCo1−x Cu x O3 prepared by the reactive grinding process at low temperature showed the formation of nanometric perovskite crystals with nanocrystalline morphology. X-ray diffraction revealed that introduction of copper into the perovskite lattice resulted in a distorted structure. The substitution of cobalt by copper is directly affecting the redox properties and stability of the perovskite-type mixed oxides. A large amount of adsorbed oxygen was released from the ground perovskites LaCo1−x Cu x O3−δ (at x >0) reflecting a high concentration of surface ionic vacancies. Under reducing conditions, part of the cobalt and copper ions on the perovskite grain boundaries is directly reduced to the metallic states at relatively low reduction temperature which produces copper and cobalt metals dispersed on a mixture of intermediate oxides. The reduction process depends not only on the structure and composition, but also strongly on the morphology of the perovskite sample. Copper in close proximity to cobalt sites in perovskite lattice plays an important role in the promotion of cobalt reducibility in perovskites and the production of higher alcohols. Thus, the details of the catalysts reducing pretreatment affect significantly the catalytic performance in higher alcohol synthesis. The partially reduced phase of a series of ground perovskites LaCo1−x Cu x O3−δ was examined for the synthesis of alcohols and hydrocarbons from syngas. 11.7–25.7% of carbon monoxide was converted into a homolog series of hydrocarbons (from methane to undecane) and a set of linear primary alcohols with the chain growth probability values ranging from 0.34 to 0.42. The selectivity to alcohols is about 36.5–49.5% and productivity passes through a maximum at 49.6mg/gcat/h for x ≈0.3. The catalytic results showed that an increase in copper results in increasing alcohol productions. Other reaction conditions such as preparation, morphology, composition, structure of catalyst are critical factors affecting both alcohol productivity and selectivity. A homogeneous distribution of the metallic cobalt–copper is a key characteristic for the synthesis of higher alcohols."
