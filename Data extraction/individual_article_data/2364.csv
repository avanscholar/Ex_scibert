0,Introduction,"Wound dressings protect the wound from environmental damage and accelerate wound healing [1,2]. Gauze is one of the commonly used traditional wound dressings. It’s cheap and readily available. However, it tends to stick to the wound beds, and has no antibacterial properties [3,4,5]. In order to overcome the shortcomings of traditional wound dressing, many ideal wound dressings have been developed and studied. The ideal wound dressing should provide a moist micro-environment at the wound bed, remove wound exudate, permit the exchange of gas, and effectively reduce bacterial infection, creating a relatively sterile microenvironment [6]. So far, many types of wound dressing have been developed, such as films [7,8], hydrogels [9], sponges [10]. Among them, sponge dressing is a new type of medical dressing, which has a connected hole structure, excellent air permeability and can absorb a large amount of exudate, so it has attracted much attention in recent years [11]. For example, Chen Group had developed a chitosan-based wound dressing with excellent antibacterial and biocompatibility properties through mixed Ag/ZnO nanocomposites [12]. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) has attracted much attention in the wound dressing field due to its non-toxicity [13,14], excellent biocompatibility and biodegradable [15,16]. However, PVA has no intrinsic antibacterial ability, which limited application in wound dressing [17]. For addressing those charges, various antimicrobial agents have been introduced into PVA. Common antimicrobial agents include antibiotics [18], quaternary ammonium salts [19,20], metal antimicrobials, etc. [21]. However, abuse of antibiotics could lead to the development of drug-resistant bacteria [22], and metal antimicrobials are cytotoxic for body [23]. On the contrast, quaternary ammonium salt antimicrobial agent have many merits, such as high antimicrobial activity, stable and long-lasting performance and low cytotoxicity etc. [24,25,26]. Especially, quaternary ammonium poly(2-(Dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (QPDMAEMA) is a commonly used antimicrobial agent with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity as well as having excellent biocompatibility [27,28]. Li and colleagues prepared cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) with excellent antibacterial properties by grafting QPDMAEMA onto the surface of CNCs. Therefore, preparation of antibacterial PVA through grafting polymerization by DMAEMA was an effective method [29]. Chitosan (CS) is a natural biological material and has many advantages, such as non-toxic [30], biodegradable properties, excellent biocompatibility and antimicrobial properties [31,32]. Liu and co-workers had prepared a CS-based composite hydrogel wound dressing with excellent antibacterial properties and biocompatibility, and applied for treating bacterial wound infection [33]. However, raw CS wound dressing with low flexibility is limited application in wound dressing through freeze-drying technology [34,35]. To address this problem, PVA was introduced into CS to improve its flexibility [36]. In this study, we had successfully prepared a kind of PVA-based composite material with excellent antibacterial and biocompatibility properties. Firstly, PVA was modified with DMAEMA by free-radical graft polymerization, and then quaternized by 1-bromobutane and abbreviated as QPVD. Next, QPVD/CS composite sponge wound dressing (QPVDC) was prepared by freeze-drying technology and cross-linking by glutaraldehyde vapor. The QPVDC wound dressing structure and morphology were measured by FT-IR and SEM, respectively. Besides, water absorption, porosity and mechanical properties also had systematically studied. Furthermore, the results of hemolysis, antibacterial properties and cytotoxicity indicated that QPVDC wound dressing possess excellent hemocompatibility, antibacterial properties and no significant cytotoxicity for MSCs. Abovementioned, QPVDC wound dressing has great potential application in the wound dressing field."

The lyophilized wound dressings were immersed in ethanol for 1 h. And then removed from ethanol, the excess ethanol on the surface was removed by filter paper. The porosity of wound dressing was calculated by the following formula: P o r o s i t y = w 1 - w 0 ρ V 0 ∗ 100 % where w0 and V0 were corresponding to the mass and volume of the wound dressing, w1 was the weight of wound dressing after ethanol immersion, ρ was the density of ethanol (0.7893 g/cm3) at 20 °C. The water absorption properties of QPVDC wound dressing were characterized by gravimetric method [11]. Briefly, the lyophilized wound dressings were soaked in PBS solution at 37 °C for 24 h, and then taken out from PBS, the excess water on the surface was removed by filter paper. the water absorption of wound dressing was calculated by the following formula: water absorption= w 1 - w 0 w 0 *100\% where w1 was the wet weight of wound dressing, and w0 was the dry weight of wound dressing."

The mechanical properties of wound dressings were measured at a speed of 10 mm/min. Each sample group was measured at least 5 times.
10,In vitro antibacterial assay,"2.9 In vitro antibacterial assay E. coli and S. aureus were incubated in 5 mL Luria-Bertani (LB) medium for 8 h (37 °C, 180 rpm). Then, the bacteria suspension in logarithmic growth period was diluted with PBS to obtain a concentration approached 106 CFU/ml. The antibacterial activity of wound dressing against E. coli and S. aureus was tested by colony-counting method. Firstly, all samples were sterilized by 75% ethanol aqueous for 2 h. And then 20 mg sponge wound dressings were co-cultured with 500 µL E. coli and S. aureus in LB medium at 37 °C for 6 h, respectively. Next, 20 μL of the diluted bacterial suspension were cultured in agar plate at 37 °C for 24 h. Finally, counting the bacterial colonies on the agar plate, and calculate the antibacterial activity of the wound dressing by the following formula. Antibacterial activity= N c - N s Nc *100\% where, Nc and Ns were the number of colonies on the agar plate of the control group and the antibacterial treatment group, respectively. The control group was pure diluted bacterial suspension cultured on the plate agar. The cell morphology of E. coli and S. aureus were observed by SEM (SEM: 4800). Briefly, the logarithmic growth phase bacteria were obtained by incubating E. coli and S. aureus in sterile LB medium, then diluted with PBS to 1 × 108 CFU/mL, the bottom bacteria were collected by centrifugation (4000 r/min, 5 min) and then resuspended in PBS. The bacteria were treated with 5 mm diameter QPVDC sponge and cultured at 37 °C for 2 h. Among them, the group without sample as blank control. Next, the bacteria were collected by centrifugation. Next, the dead bacteria were collected by centrifugation, washed by PBS 3 times and immobilized by 4 wt% glutaraldehyde aqueous for 24 h. Finally, bacterial was dehydrated by gradient ethanol solutions (30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, 95%, 100%) and dried on vacuum oven overnight."
11,Hemolytic assay,"2.10 Hemolytic assay The hemolysis of wound dressing was measured by rabbit anticoagulation blood. Briefly, wound dressings with a diameter 2 mm were cultured with 200 μL diluted red blood solution (v (red blood cell): v (saline solution) = 1: 25) at 37 °C for 1 h. Especially, red blood cell suspension co-cultured with PBS and DI water were set as negative control group and positive control group, respectively. Then supernatants were obtained through centrifuged at 1500 r/min for 10 min, and measured the absorbance of the supernatant at 545 nm with microplate reader (ELx800). The hemolysis rate (HR) was calculated by the following formula. HR= OD sample - OD negative OD positive - OD negative *100\% Especially, ODsample , ODpositive and ODnegative were corresponding to the absorbance of supernatants of wound dressing, positive control and negative control, respectively."
12,In vitro cell assay,"2.11 In vitro cell assay The cytotoxicity of wound dressing was measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) staining method. Briefly, the wound dressings were sterilized with 75 wt% ethanol aqueous for 2 h, then the sponge dressing was saturated with DMEM medium, and then 0.5 g of pre-absorbed saturated sample was soaked with 5 mL DMEM medium for 48 h, then the extract solution was prepared. The mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs, 1.0 * 104 cell /well) were seeded in 48-well plate and co-cultured with 200 μL extract solution biochemical incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 24 h. Especially, MSCs co-cultured with DMEM medium was control group. Finally, the cell suspension was stained by CCK-8. Absorbing of cell suspension was measured at 450 nm by Microplate Reader (ELx800). The cell viability of the wound dressings was calculated according to the following formula. Cell viability = OD sample OD control *100\% where ODsample and ODcontrol were corresponding to the absorbance of the samples and control groups, respectively. The morphology of MSCs on 24-well plate was measured by Live/Dead staining method.

The mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs, 1.0*104 cell /well) were seeded in 24-well plate and co-cultured with extract solution biochemical incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 24 h. Especially, MSCs co-cultured with DMEM medium was control group. Calcein-AM/propidium iodide mixture was co-cultured with cells for 30 min, and washed three times by/via/through PBS, and cell morphology was observed using laser confocal microscope (Leica Microsystem)."
13,Results and discussion,
14,Synthesis of PVD and QPVD copolymer,"3.1 Synthesis of PVD and QPVD copolymer QPVD copolymer was prepared by two-step reaction, and the synthesis process was shown in Scheme 1 . The chemical structures of PVA, PVD and QPVD copolymers were confirmed by 1H NMR (Fig. 1 ). The 1H NMR spectrum of PVA showed a multiplet signal between 1.31 and 1.74 ppm corresponding to methylene (a, CH 2) protons. At 3.93 ppm attributed to methine (b, CH OH) protons. Compared with PVA, the spectrum of PVD copolymer showed several new characteristic peaks, the signals at 2.74 ppm and 4.12 ppm were attributed to methylene (g, NCH 2) protons and (f, CH 2 CO), respectively. Moreover, the signal at 2.27 ppm correspond to methyl (h, N(CH 3)2) protons of PDMAEMA. Thus, demonstrating that PDMAEMA was successfully grafted onto PVA. Compared with the PVD copolymer, the signals at 3.14 ppm correspond to methyl (h, N+(CH 3)3) protons of QPVD. After quaternization, the methyl (h, N(CH 3)3) protons all shifted from 2.27 ppm to 3.14 ppm, verifying PVD was quaternized completely. A series of PVD polymers were prepared by free radical graft copolymerization, and their characterization data was shown in Table 2 . The PVD was characterized by elemental analysis, and the grafting yield was calculated by the nitrogen content of PVD. It could be seen that the grafting yield tends to increase and then decrease with the increase of DMAEMA. However, when the amount of DMAEMA reached a certain value, the tendency of polymer self-polymerization increased, and the increase of homopolymer decreased the grafting yield. Obviously, the grafting rate of PVD-4 was found to be the highest, so this ratio was chosen for the subsequent experiments. QPVD polymer was obtained by the complete quaternization of PVD-4 by the addition of excess 1-bromobutane."
15,Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR),"3.2 Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) The functional groups of QPVDC wound dressing were characterized by FT-IR in Fig. 2 . For QPVD, the peak at 3300–3500 cm−1 was assigned to OH. The vibrational band observed at 2934 cm−1 and 2842 cm−1 were assigned to the stretching CH from alkyl groups. The absorption peak observed at 1723 cm−1 was attributed to CO stretching vibration. The bonds at 1490 cm−1 and 1021 cm−1 were due to the stretching vibration of CC and CN, respectively. For CS, the peak at 3300–3500 cm−1 was corresponding to OH and NH2 stretching vibrations. 1641 cm−1 and 1420 cm−1 were assigned to amide I and NH deformation vibration of amide, respectively [38]. The peak at 1086 cm−1 and 891 cm−1 were assigned to saccharine structure and pyranose ring of chitosan, respectively [39]. Apparently, the characteristic peaks of QPVD and CS all appeared in the QPVDC wound dressings. Among them, from QPVDC-1 to QPVDC-4, the characteristic peak of CO gradually weakened with the decrease of QPVD content, and the peak of Schiffer base CN (1561 cm−1) cross-linked with glutaraldehyde vapor gradually enhanced with the increase of CS content. In summary, QPVDC wound dressing with different proportions was successfully prepared."
16,Scanning electron microscope (SEM),"3.3 Scanning electron microscope (SEM) The morphology of QPVDC wound dressing was observed by SEM, and results were shown in Fig. 3 . All porous structures of QPVDC and CS wound dressings were interconnected. The surface of the pore wall in CS sponge was very smooth. while the surfaces of the pore wall in QPVDC sponges were rough. With the increase of QPVD, the pores size of QPVDC wound dressing were smaller with CS decreased. In addition, the pore walls were rougher with QPVD increased. This finding was attributed to the interpenetrating network structure formed between QPVDC and CS due to hydrogen bonding [40]. Therefore, the micro-morphology of wound dressing could be controlled by QPVD content. Furthermore, small rough cavity could improve the swelling of the sponge, which can absorb more wound exudate to promote healing."
17,Porosity and water absorption,"3.4 Porosity and water absorption Wound exudate has sufficient nutrient content and is prone to bacterial growth, which can lead to wound infection. Wound dressings with high porosity could improve the ability of absorption wound exudate and thus prevent wound infection. In addition, high porosity of wound dressing could help to nutrients and oxygen exchange [34]. The porosity of CS and QPVDC wound dressings were shown in Fig. 4 . The porosity of all sponges was above 75%. Compared with the porosity of CS sponge (85%), the porosity of QPVDC-1 ~ 4 increased from 75%, 77%, 80%, 84% respectively. It could be seen that the porosity of QPVDC wound dressings decreased compared to CS. The ideal wound dressing should provide a high porosity of 60–90%, which can facilitate the absorption of wound exudate [41]. The porosity of the prepared wound dressing was greater than 75%, which was a kind of high porosity material and suitable for wound dressing applications [42]. Sponge wound dressing with interconnected and rich pore structure could improve water absorbing ability, which could help to absorb more wound exudate, and keep a moist micro-environment for accelerating wound healing. The water absorption of QPVDC wound dressing was shown in Fig. 5 , water absorption capacity of all wound dressings exceeded 900%. Especially, the water uptake ability of CS, QPVDC-1 ~ 4 were 900%, 2300%, 1700%, 1600% and 1300%, respectively. Compared with CS wound dressing, the water absorption of all groups of wound dressings increased with QPVD increased. It may be owing to the abundant hydrogen and ionic bonds with high hydrophilicity in the QPVD structure. In summary, the prepared QPVDC wound dressing has excellent water absorption capacity."
18,Mechanical test,"3.5 Mechanical test The tensile strength and elongation at break of the dressings were shown in Fig. 6 . The tensile strength of CS wound dressing was 1.3 MPa, which was higher than the previously reported CS dressing [43]. The tensile strength of QPVDC-1 ~ 4 wound dressings were 0.78, 0.90, 0.91 and 1.14 MPa, respectively. Compared with CS wound dressing, addition QPVD into CS could reduce the tensile strength by 13–40%. However, it was still sufficient for wound dressing application [42]. As shown in Fig. 8 (b), the elongation at break of QPVDC-1 ~ 4 and CS wound dressing was 18.06%, 17.34%, 12.89%, 12.02% and 8.45%, respectively. Compared with CS sponge dressing, the incorporation of QPVD to CS increased tensile strength at break by 40–113%. It may be due to more CS could provide more hydrogen bond and covalent bonds after cross-linking with glutaraldehyde vapor, which could provide more binding force and significantly improve the tensile strength of sponge dressing. However, more CS could be more brittle, while the addition of QPVD could increase the flexibility of the wound dressing."
19,In vitro antibacterial assay,"3.6 In vitro antibacterial assay Wounds infected with bacteria caused inflammation and prolonged healing time [44]. The antibacterial activity of the wound dressings was measured by S. aureus and E. coli through colony-counting method. The antibacterial activity results were shown in Fig. 7 a, and photographs of bacterial colony on agar plate were shown in Fig. 7b. The antibacterial activity of all the samples was greater than 88%, indicating that all the sponge samples have the ability to restrain the growth of bacteria to a certain degree. In contrast, the agar plate of control group had more bacterial colonies, the colonies of CS agar plate were reduced, and the QPVDC-1 agar plate had almost no bacterial colonies. Among them, antibacterial activity of QPVDC-1 and QPVDC-2 were approach to 100%, which was higher than the previously reported wound dressings [45]. The results showed that the antibacterial activity of QPVDC sponge was better than that of CS sponge, and the antibacterial activity increased significantly with the increase of QPVD. Therefore, QPVDC sponges can provide a relatively sterile environment for wound healing. The morphological of E. coli and S. aureus were observed by SEM and results shown in Fig. 7c, the normal morphology of E. coli (figure (c, I)) were rod-shaped with quite smooth and intact cells. The normal morphology of S. aureus (Fig. 7 (c,III)) was round spherical. Compared with normal bacterial, cell membrane of bacterial were defected after co-culture with QPVDC wound dressings. The cell membrane of E. coli was wrinkled and damaged with some cytoplasm leakages. S. aureus cell membranes were also broken, both showing incomplete cell morphology. QPVDC wound dressings may have a strong effect on the cell membranes of E. coli and S. aureus, thereby damaging the integrity of the bacterial cell membranes and leading to cytoplasmic leakage [46]."
20,Hemolysis assay,"3.7 Hemolysis assay Blood compatibility was an important index for wound dressing. Red blood cells membrane could be destroyed once poor hemocompatibility material contact with plasma [33]. Hemolysis ratio (HR) was performed as an easy and reliable approach to evaluate blood compatibility of materials [47]. The HR of the positive control group is 100%, and the HR of the negative control group is 0%. The results of HR values of different wound dressings were shown in Fig. 8 . The HR value of CS was 0.55%. However, QPVDC-1 ~ 4 were 1.45%, 1.03%, 1.26%, 1.06%, respectively. It may be due to quaternary ammonium cation ions that could disrupt the red blood cell membrane and release hemoglobin. According to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 10993-4, materials with a hemolysis rate of less than 5% have excellent blood compatibility and will not cause severe hemolysis of cells [48]. All samples were not significantly hemolysis owing to HR were far below 5%. Therefore, QPVDC wound dressing had excellent blood compatibility."
21,Cytoxicity of wound dressing,"3.8 Cytoxicity of wound dressing An ideal wound dressing should possess low cytotoxicity. The cytotoxicity of wound dressing was measured by CCK-8 and results were shown in Fig. 9 a. Compared with control group, CS and QPVDC-2 ~ 4 were no significant cytotoxicity for MSCs. However, QPVDC-1 had cytotoxicity (80%). The cell viability of QPVDC-2 ~ 4 were 106%, 113% and 123%. The results showed that quaternary ammonium cation had a certain inhibitory effect on cells. [49] Therefore, the levels of cytotoxicity and QPVD showed a negative correlation. The cytotoxicity could be controlled by adjusting the ratio of CS to QPVD. The cell morphology was observed under confocal microscope staining by calcein-AM/PI. The living/dead staining results were shown in Fig. 9b, all MSCs had a shuttle-shaped cell morphology and showed green fluorescence, indicating cell survival and almost no death. Compared with the control group, cells co-cultured with CS and QPVDC-2 ~ 4 groups were green fluorescence and almost no red fluorescence, and the cells were spindle-like, indicating that the cells grew well without cytotoxicity. QPVDC-1 showed red a small amount of red fluorescence, indicating partial cell death. This result was consistent with cytotoxicity. The results showed that CS and QPVDC-2 ~ 4 had no cytotoxicity."
22,Conclusion,"QPVD was successfully synthesized by free radical graft polymerization. QPVDC wound dressing with different proportions was prepared by freeze-drying method. Compared with CS wound dressing, QPVDC wound dressing has a higher water absorption capacity, with the highest water absorption capacity reaching 2300%, which is conducive to absorbing wound exudate. Interestingly, flexibility of QPVDC wound dressing was significantly improved with QPVD introduced. The tensile strength and elongation at break are increased by 13–40% and 40–113%, respectively. QPVDC-1 and QPVDC-2 showed good antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, which antimicrobial effect was close to 100%. QPVDC-1 has cytotoxicity, and QPVDC-2 has excellent antibacterial activity, low hemolysis rate and no cytotoxicity. Therefore, QPVDC-2 has potential application value in future clinical applications."
