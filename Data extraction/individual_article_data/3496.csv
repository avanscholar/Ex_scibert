0,Introduction,"The catalytic oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes is an extremely crucial step at both laboratory and industrial scales [1]. Benzaldehyde, as an important intermediate in the synthesis of many organic compounds [2–4], is mainly produced by two methods: benzyl chloride hydrolysis and toluene oxidation [5]. Nevertheless, these methods have serious limitations for a wide range of applications due to chloride contamination and relatively low selectivity for benzaldehyde. Whether avoiding chlorine contamination or insufficient contact of the oxidant with the reaction substrate, there is no doubt that the use of oxygen as the terminal oxidant for liquid oxidation is a relatively good choice [6]. Palladium-based catalysts have been extensively studied for aerobic oxidation reactions, such as alcohol oxidation [7], CO oxidation [8] and toluene oxidation [9]. However, the strong interaction between the support and the metal tends to cause the nanoparticles (NPs) to agglomerate during catalyst preparation [10]. Referring to the literature of the predecessors, we know that the properties of the catalyst support plays a prominent role in the size and distribution of the PdNPs [11–14]. The support may influence the particle size and electronic structure of the palladium clusters to have an impact on the catalyst activity. The adsorption and mass transfer processes of the reaction substrate may be affected by the physicochemical properties of the support. Therefore, targeted supporting materials with enriched surface chemistry and high surface areas are required to anchor PdNPs, obtained structure and surface information on their uniformly distributed PdNPs are meaningful for correlating with achieved catalytic performance. Carbon materials, such as carbon nanotubes, activated carbon and graphene oxide, are widely used in catalysis fields [15–17]. Graphene aerogels were firstly proposed by Hu et al. [18], which has excellent electrical conductivity, large surface area and good stability. At present, the material is widely used in the fields of supercapacitors, hydrogen production and electrooxidation of methanol [19–21]. In addition, the composite graphene material (such as Ti3C2TX, Carbon nanotubes, MoS2) can effectively adjust the metal electronic structure, reduce the overall defect density of the hybrid support, and effectively reduce the charge transfer resistance of the overall catalyst [22–24]. In our work, Pd/RGO aerogels, with large surface areas and wrinkles, are obtained through the lyophilisation, vacuum and reduction treatments and tested as a catalyst for the solvent-free oxidation of benzyl alcohol. The freeze-drying step retains the structural integrity while promoting the dispersion of palladium particles. The subsequent vacuum treatment further expands the interlayer spacing of GO, thus forming more wrinkles to anchor and encapsulate the PdNPs. For comparison, Pd/AC was prepared as a reference catalyst and tested under the same conditions. A micro high-pressure reactor was used to evaluate the catalytic performance and to achieve rapid optimization of the reaction conditions. Analyses were applied on fresh and reacted catalyst to study the structure-performance correlation."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals The raw GO (power, 99.9%) was purchased from Shanghai Carbon Source Huigu New Materials Company. The size of the GO flakes is in a range of 10 μm to 20 μm (as shown in Fig. S1). Benzyl alcohol (98%), AC and Pd(NO3)2 (10 wt% of 10 wt% nitric acid) were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. Hydrogen (H2,99.99%) and helium (He,99.99%) were supplied from WeiChuang, Shanghai. All solutions were prepared with ultrapure Milli-Q water."
3,Synthesis of Pd/RGO aerogels and Pd/AC,"2.2 Synthesis of Pd/RGO aerogels and Pd/AC 400 mg of the raw GO was mixed with 800 mL of distilled water and ultrasonically (56 kHZ) dispersed for 2 h. 240 μL of palladium nitrate was diluted into 10 mL of distilled water and then added dropwise to the mixed solution. Next, the mixed solution was further sonicated for 0.5 h and then lyophilized. Subsequently, annealing was applied under vacuum at 500 °C for 30 min at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Finally, the reduction treatment was carried out at 250 °C for 1 h at a heating rate of 3 °C/min under a H2/He atmosphere (25/100 sccm) to obtain the final Pd/RGO aerogel catalyst. Similarly, palladium was supported on AC by a wet impregnation method. Firstly, 20 mL of absolute ethanol and 100 mg of AC were mixed by ultrasonication. After that, 60 μL of a palladium nitrate solution was diluted with 1.5 mL of ethanol and added dropwise to the mixed solution. The mixed solution was sonicated for 5 min and then stirred by magnetic stirring at 45 °C at a rate of 250 r/min. Finally, the reduction conditions were the same as those of the Pd/RGO aerogels. The total metal loading of Pd/RGO aerogels and Pd/AC was 3.50 wt% and 3.88 wt%, respectively (measured by ICP-OES)."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies were performed on a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi using an Al Kα monochromated (150 W, 30 eV pass energy, 500 μm spot size) source. The morphologies and structures of the catalysts were analysed by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM 6701F). For TEM characterisation, the catalyst TEM specimens were prepared by a typical ultrasound method. The sample was dispersed in ethanol and a drop of the suspension was added onto a perforated C/Cu TEM grid for the TEM investigations. High-angle annular dark field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images were acquired by using an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 microscope equipped with HAADF-STEM and EDX detectors. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8-Advanced X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα1 radiation (40 kV, 40 mA, 10°/min−1 from 10° to 90°). Raman spectra were carried 3 times on a Horiba Scientific LabRAM HR Evolution system with an Ar-ion laser at an excitation wavelength of 633 nm. The Pd content of the Pd/RGO aerogels and Pd/AC collected with an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, PerkinElmer Optima 8000)."
5,Catalyst test,"2.4 Catalyst test The oxidation reaction was performed in a micro autoclave (100 mL scale). Benzyl alcohol (40 mL) and catalyst (20 mg) were uniformly mixed and charged with a polytetrafluoroethylene liner. The micro autoclave was purged four times with 5 bar of oxygen and the pressure was adjusted to the desired value for the reaction. In order to maintain a constant pressure throughout the experiment, we need to continuously replenish oxygen while oxygen is being consumed. Simultaneously, the reaction agitation speed was set at 1500 rpm and the temperature was regulated to the required reaction temperature. Products were taken periodically through the product tube of the reactor and analysed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a SPD20A detector with an Inert SustainC18 column."
6,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the preparation of the Pd/RGO aerogel catalyst. Briefly, the raw GO was mixed with distilled water, stirred and ultrasonically dispersed for 2 h. Next, the diluted palladium nitrate solution was added dropwise to the mixture and dispersed by ultrasonic vibration for 0.5 h. After 2.5 h of sonication, the cations are deposited on the surface of the support while the interlayer spacing of the raw GO is enlarged. Subsequently, the mixed solution was desiccated by lyophilisation to retain the integrity of the structure. Further annealing was carried out at 500 °C for 0.5 h at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under vacuum to collect the as-obtained materials for the purpose of expanding the interlayer spacing [25]. Finally, the obtained material was reduced in a tube furnace at 250 °C for 1 h at a heating rate of 3 °C/min under He/H2 (25/100 sccm) atmosphere to produce the final Pd/RGO aerogel catalyst. As shown in Fig. 2 , after two calcination steps, the two-dimensional structure obtained by lyophilisation remained intact. The morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared Pd/RGO aerogels were characterised by SEM and TEM. A two-dimensional sheet morphology of typical GO wrinkles can be observed from Fig. 2(a) and (b). As shown in Fig. 2(c), the PdNPs are uniformly dispersed on the Pd/RGO aerogels. According to the statistical analysis of the histogram (inset in Fig. 2(c)), the PdNPs on the Pd/RGO aerogels show an average diameter of 2.95 ± 0.2 nm. However, in the case of Pd/AC (shown in Fig. S2), the metal particles are obviously coalesced with an average size of 7.5 ± 0.2 nm. Fig. 2(d) shows the HRTEM image of the PdNPs, with d-spacings of 2.24 and 1.94 Å, corresponding to the lattice fringes of Pd (1 1 1) and Pd (2 0 0), respectively. The results of energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping of different elements in the Pd/RGO aerogels are shown in Fig. 2(f), demonstrating the uniform distribution of C, O and Pd in the Pd/RGO aerogels. The crystal structures of the as-prepared Pd/RGO aerogels and Pd/AC were obtained by XRD. As shown in Fig. 3 (a), the peak at ~24.5° is attributed to C(0 0 2) [26]. Nevertheless, the diffraction peak of palladium is not obvious due to the small particle size of the metal NPs [27], which is consistent with the TEM results. Raman spectroscopy studies have also been conducted, which is a sensitive technique for studying the degree of graphitisation of catalysts. The Raman spectra of the Pd/AC and Pd/RGO aerogels are shown in Fig. 3(b). The D band at ~1329 cm−1 originates from the defects of graphene, whereas the G band at 1597 cm−1 is related to the E2g mode, which results from the vibration of sp2 bonded carbon atoms [28]. The ratio of ID/IG is usually used to indicate the degree of disorder of carbon materials. In the present study, the ID/IG value for as-prepared Pd/RGO aerogels and Pd/AC were 1.24 and 1.05, respectively, indicating that Pd/RGO aerogels have more structural defects than Pd/AC. XPS was applied to characterise the surface electronic properties of the catalysts. In the Pd 3d region (Fig. 4 (a)), the Pd 3d5/2 peak at 335.69 eV and the Pd 3d3/2 peak at 340.85 eV are assigned to Pd0 species [29]. In addition, the Pd 3d5/2 peak at 337.17 eV and the Pd 3d3/2 peak at 342.35 eV are assigned to Pd2+. The remaining two peaks are attributed to the incompletely reduced palladium precursor salt or reprecipitation, thereby forming a divalent polynuclear palladium hydroxy complex [30,31]. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the Pd/RGO aerogel catalyst displayed the evidence peak of C 1 s, the binding energy peaks at 284.8, 285.7 and 287.1 eV are observed for this sample, corresponding to graphitic C-C, C-O and C = O groups, respectively [32]. Compared to Pd/AC (as shown in Fig. S3), the Pd/RGO aerogels showed additional C 1s binding energy peak at 290.1 eV, corresponding to the carboxyl groups [33]. The elemental composition of each catalyst measured by XPS can be derived from Table S1. It can be seen from the atomic ratio (C 1s/O 1s) that Pd/RGO aerogels exhibit more functional groups than the Pd/AC. Based on the deconvolution of the C 1s peak, the percentage of total oxygen-containing groups in Pd/RGO aerogels is ~37% (Table S1). The contents of C-O and CO groups on the surfaces of two fresh catalysts are in similar amounts. In the case of OCO groups, it only appeared in the catalyst of Pd/RGO aerogels. The solvent-free oxidation of benzyl alcohol was carried out in a gas-liquid-solid three-phase mixed sealed state. For comparison, the Pd/AC catalyst was also evaluated as a reference catalyst under the identical reaction conditions. The catalytic performance of two catalysts can be seen from Fig. 5 . For Pd/RGO aerogels, at 140 °C and 10 bar O2, the conversion of benzyl alcohol ~80% is achieved after 3 h reaction time. In contrast, the conversion of Pd/AC under the same condition is about 40%, and the selectivity is relatively poor. Moreover, within similar experimental conditions, the Pd/RGO aerogels exhibit better activity and selectivity compared with other catalysts reported in literatures [34]. As can be seen from Table S2, the by-products of the reaction are mainly toluene and benzyl benzoate. Toluene is mainly derived from disproportionation or hydrogenolysis of benzyl alcohol, while benzyl benzoate is produced by esterification between benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde [35]. Additionally, subsequent experiments were also carried out under 1 bar, the selectivity and conversion of the main product can be seen from Fig. S4. The TEM image of the reacted Pd/RGO aerogels is shown in Fig. 6 . After 3 h of solvent-free benzyl alcohol oxidation, no significant differences in the structure of the Pd/RGO aerogels were observed. Moreover, the PdNPs on Pd/RGO aerogels remained in a high dispersion status. The Pd/RGO aerogels synthesis involved the process of lyophilisation avoids the use of organic reagents in the traditional preparation methods. The wrinkles on the surface of the Pd/RGO aerogels increase the specific surface area. It was reported that Pd/RGO aerogels have a higher surface area in comparison to Pd/AC [36,37]. The PdNPs encapsulated in the graphene oxide sheets inhibit the aggregation effect, which may be beneficial for exposing the catalytically active sites during the reaction [38]. It is known that the oxygen-containing functional groups usually caused the chemical property variant of the support, which had effects on the state of Pd states [39]. Given to the XPS analysis, the Pd/RGO aerogels with more oxygen-containing groups possessed a higher proportion of Pd2+ than the Pd/AC catalyst. The enrichment of the surface oxygen groups was available for the increase of Pd2+ species and was an important factor in tuning the interaction between Pd species and the support. The ratio of Pd0/Pd2+ in the catalyst can be obtained from Table S3. The performance of the catalyst in the oxidation of alcohol is tightly related to the dispersion of PdNPs and the proportion of Pd2+, which has been reported by Lee and Wilson [40]. In comparison to the reference catalyst, Pd/RGO aerogels contained a higher proportion of Pd2+, which may act as the active sites in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. In addition, it has been confirmed by the XANES measurements that the surface environments of the PdNPs evolve from oxide to metal as the size of the Pd cluster increased [41]. In our work, it is revealed that the proportion of surface palladium oxide (Pd2+) is correlated to the surface chemistry of GO support. Furthermore, due to the interaction between the surface functional groups and Pd species, PdNPs remain dispersed in nanoscale on the reacted Pd/RGO aerogels."
7,Conclusion,"In this work, Pd/RGO aerogels with large surface areas and enriched oxygen-containing functional groups have been obtained by a facile method that combines lyophilisation, vacuum and reduction treatments. Compared with the reference catalyst Pd/AC, the Pd/RGO aerogel catalyst exhibits improved performance during the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. According to the surface analyses, the Pd/RGO aerogel catalyst contained a higher proportion Pd2+ than the Pd/AC. In addition, Pd/RGO aerogels with large surfaces and wrinkles provided a platform for anchoring PdNPs, while surface functional groups facilitate the formation of active sites by tuning the interaction between palladium and support. Moreover, due to the interaction between the metal and the support, PdNPs on Pd/RGO aerogels showed a good thermal stability after the 3 h oxidation reaction. The synthesis methodology in the present work, involving the combination of lyophilisation, vacuum and reduction processes, may be applied for general catalyst design routes which take advantage of the surface chemistry of aerogels in affecting catalysis."
