0,Introduction,"The scarcity of fossil fuels and the problems of air pollution draw researchers to explore more efficient and cleaner energy resources. Fuel cells are considered to be a promising source with its reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and preservation of the fossil energy resources [1]. In the last decades, a wide variety of methods and feed stocks have been investigated for the production of hydrogen for fuel cells. Among them, the hydrogen production from bio-ethanol is of great interests for several reasons: (i) ethanol is a renewable source which can be easily obtained by agricultural residues and fermentation of surplus [2]; (ii) it could be easily decomposed in the presence of water to generate a hydrogen-rich mixture; (iii) nontoxic with the sulphur. Producing hydrogen from ethanol reforming would not only be environmentally friendly but also would open new opportunities for utilization of renewable resources, which are globally available [3]. However, since on board hydrogen production out of ethanol (reforming) for fuel cells feed is subject to problems when used with traditional catalysts, such as high device weight, a relatively long transient time and poisoning problems, which can make the integration onboard vehicle complex, its production in situ from liquid feedstock using plasmas can be an effective way [2]. In general, the plasmas generated by those discharge could be divided into thermal plasma and non-thermal plasma. Presently, a large variety of plasma technologies have been utilized in the last few years including dielectric barrier discharge (DBD), corona, microwave, radio frequency (RF), glow discharge and gliding arc discharge to reform the hydrocarbons such as diesel [4], bio-oil (soybean oil [5], rapeseed oil [6]), JP-8, glycerol [7], heavy oil [8] and toluene [9]. For example, Tsai et al. [10] studied the steam reforming of ethanol for hydrogen production in a plasma hydrogen reformer, obtained the optimal temperature and S/C ratio of 750 °C and 1:3 respectively. Wang et al. [11] employed a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) as reactive media to reform ethanol under different reaction conditions, obtained the maximum ethanol conversion rate and hydrogen yield of 88.4% and 31.8% respectively. A same plasma reactor was used by Hu et al. [12] to investigate the reforming efficiency of hydro-ethanol, obtained a lower conversion rate of 45%. A microwave surface-wave discharge used by Yanguas-Gil et al. [13] to obtain hydrogen from ethanol gave rise to almost 100% reforming yield with H2, solid carbon, CO, and CO2 as the main reaction products. Calzada et al. [14] and Tataroua et al. [15] also studied the reforming of alcohols in a surface-wave discharge (SWD) at atmospheric pressure, the former found that no sub-products of CO and CO2 were detected along with the production of hydrogen. The reforming of pure ethanol and E85 has been investigated by Petitpas et al. [16] using a non-thermal high voltage–low current arc plasma torch. The focus of these plasma fuel reforming researches have largely been on finding the best discharge for ethanol reforming to improve the conversion efficiency and energy efficiency. The disadvantages for thermal plasmas are the erosion and the evaporation of its electrodes because of the high temperature. From the previous work of plasma-assisted fuel reforming, we can know that the limitations with DBD are their low energy efficiency (∼10% [11]) and low power density due to the limited current and low gas temperature. Microwave discharge requires complex and somewhat more expensive power supplies that include a high frequency generator to initiate high frequency plasma. Furthermore, the characteristic of various non-thermal plasmas for hydrogen production out of hydrocarbons (reforming) have been analyzed by Petitpas et al. [17]. The most suitable way for syngas production from ethanol reforming is reported to be non-thermal gliding arc discharge. Non-thermal gliding arc discharge systems have not yet been researched enough for this purpose. Among them, Locke et al. [18] introduced a non-thermal pulsed plasma-gliding arc reactor equipped with a spray nozzle to decompose alcohol using argon as carrier gas and obtained a maximum energy yield of 176 ± 35 g k Wh−1 with methanol. In this work, four types of alcohol (methanol, propanol, butanol and ethanol) were employed to investigate the formation rates and energy yield of H2 as functions of various experimental parameters. Levko et al. [19] studied the plasma kinetics of ethanol/water/air mixture in a ‘tornado’-type electric discharge, which explained the kinetic mechanism of non-equilibrium plasma chemical transformation in the gas–liquid system and the evolution of hydrogen during the reforming. In our lab, a lot of researches have been done by Du et al. [9,20–24] with the gliding arc discharge plasma reactors, such as the decolorization of acid orange 7 solution [20], decomposition of toluene [9], degradation of acid orange 7 [22,25], destruction of phenol [26] and PCDD/Fs [27] and so on. Gliding arc discharge (GAD) is known as a “warm” discharge with a temperature in the range of 2000–4000 K that can produce effective plasma with simultaneously high productivity and good selectivity. There are several disadvantages with the current GAD reactor of knife-shape [28] or 2D-planar for its geometry, such as low fuel conversion rate due to less contact time and collision frequency between feedstock and plasma. In this paper, the steam-oxidative reforming of bio-ethanol by a novel gliding arc discharge named Laval nozzle arc discharge (LNAD) was investigated at atmospheric pressure and room temperature without extra pre-heating. Differing from the conventional gliding arc discharge, the GAD in our work combines the advantages both 3-D cylindrical “tornado”-type and the supersonic/subsonic discharge. Generally, the advantages of this type of discharge are as follows: (1) Whatever supply power (DC, AC…) and carrier gas (N2, O2, Ar, CH4, H2S…) could be used to produce plasma; (2) Plasmas generated by the carrier gas were characterized by the high density of electrons (Ne > 1014 cm−3), high electric field (more than 104 V/m) and various reactive active species which could accelerate the degradation reaction; (3) Widen the plasma generation module power range while operating with a subsonic or supersonic velocity in the convergent part of the Laval nozzle; optimize and widen the fuel flow rate; (4) A coverage of higher reaction volume and a good performance of the electrodes even under oxidizing conditions for the rotation of its arc root; a wide range of substances could be destructed and decomposed, facilitated its application in the industrial field; (5) Little coke deposited on the inner wall of this novel reactor for the swirling flow, resulting in excellent plasma stability and security."
1,Material and methods,
2,Experimental set up,"2.1 Experimental set up The experiment was conducted in a new type of gliding arc discharge named Laval nozzle arc discharge (LNAD). The schematic view of the overall reactor was shown in Fig. 1 . The plasma reactor was powered by a high voltage AC power supply with an electronic neon sign transformer which is 10 kV, 200 mA at full supply voltage with the frequency of 50 Hz. An electronic watt–hour meter was used to monitor the input power applied to the reactor. A voltage regulator was used to stabilize the voltage and current in the circuit which can be impacted by the operation of plasma reactor. Moreover, the evolution of the voltage and the current in the plasma reactor under working conditions was determined by the means of oscilloscope with a high voltage probe (Tektronix P6035) and a current probe (Tektronix TP301A). A post-treatment gas system was positioned downstream for condensing the ethanol–water vapour and analyzing the exhaust gases as well as collecting the soot or coke generating in the process. The exhaust gases were determined by gas chromatography (GC-950, Haixin) to study the reforming efficiency of bio-ethanol by the non-thermal LNAD plasma reactor. The condensed liquid was analyzed using a QP2010s GC–MS (Shimadzu), equipped with DB-5MS capillary column. The major gaseous products were H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6. Except for C2H5OH and H2O, the components of condensed liquid included trace amounts of HCOOH, CH3COOH, CH3CHO and CH3COCH3. The result that Trace CH3CHO and CH3COCH3 were produced in the reforming process was also found by Zhu [29], Rossi [30] and Vasudeva et al. [31]. The detailed scheme of this novel gliding arc plasma reactor was shown in Fig. 2 . It consists of a Laval nozzle (1) made of copper with the length of 106 mm and a diameter of 10 mm, sealed by flanges (2) at the top and at the bottom, which acts as the anode. The central cylindrical stainless rod (3) with the length of 300 mm and diameter of 5 mm on the axis of symmetry constitutes the cathode. The minimum of the distance between two electrodes was 2.5 mm. The body of the reactor was made of stainless steel covered by a Teflon insulating layer, also of axial symmetry. As seen in Fig. 2, there are three main parts in this novel experimental reactor: the air–ethanol mixing part (A), the discharge part (B) and the post discharge part (C). Actually, four orifices (4) tangential to the cylinder wall (5) in the upper flange (2) were used for introducing the air into the reactor in order to mix air, ethanol and water more rapidly and homogeneously as well as make a swirling flow, one of them was equipped with a gas–liquid spray nozzle for atomizing the fuel and water. Following its tangential introduction, the mixture (air–ethanol–water) enters into the mixing part (A) in fast rotation and moves to the discharge part (B) of a tornado type where it flows out though the nozzle (1) in the form of a subsonic jet into the post discharge part (C). The amounts of ethanol and water introduced into the air flow were controlled by peristaltic pumps at room temperature to maintain a constant inlet fuel flow rate. Note that this type of movement of “tornado” was also preserved in the throat where the flow could be accelerated greatly and the distance between two electrodes was the minimum. The voltage is applied between the Laval nozzle (1) and the central stainless rod (3), electric discharge breakdown can occur at the minimum space between the two electrodes in the flow of the ethanol–water mixture in rotation. The ignition of discharge begins at the position where the breakdown happens. In addition, the conditions of breakdown in the discharge part (B) are regulated by several parameters including the gas flow rate, the value of voltage and so on [19]. Plasmas generated by the carrier gas can immediately react with the mixture of ethanol and water, producing various products including H2, CO, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, CO2, CH4 etc."
3,Calculation,"2.2 Calculation A mixture of water, air and ethanol could be produced in a controlled way by this system of device. The fuel and water mass flow rate were controlled in their liquid phase via two pumps in the range 0.10–0.35 g s−1 and 0.06–0.47 g s−1, respectively. The air flow rate was controlled ranging from 139 to 1111 cm3 s−1 correspondingly. The oxygen-to-carbon (O/C) ratio (Eq. (1)) is the ratio of twice the molar oxygen flow versus the molar flow rate of the fuel carbon within an ethanol oxidation reaction scheme. Note that oxygen from CO2 and H2O is not considered in this ratio. (1) O C ratio = n oxygen n ethanol = 0.21 n air n ethanol Similar to the O/C ratio, the S/C (water-to-carbon) ratio (Eq. (2)) is the ratio of the molar flow rate of H2O to the molar flow rate of fuel carbon. In this work, separate experiments were conducted with S/C = 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0, 2.4, 3.2 and 4.0, to study their effects on the steam reforming of ethanol with no catalyst. (2) S C ratio = n H 2 O 2 n ethanol Ethanol conversion rate χ (Eq. 3), H2 yield (Eq. (4)), CO yield (Eq. (5)) [11] and energy efficiency η (Eq. (6)) [32] are used to evaluate the steam reforming performance of ethanol, which can be expressed as: (3) χ = ( n ethanol input − n ethanol output ) n ethanol input × 100 % (4) H 2 yield ( % ) = n H 2 in product 3 n ethanol input × 100 % (5) CO yield ( % ) = n CO in product 2 n ethanol input (6) η = n H 2 × L H V H 2 + n CO × L H V CO n ethanol × L H V ethanol + I P E × 100 % LHV is defined as the lower heating values of each component. In addition, IPE is the input plasma energy. The energy efficiency is an important parameter to estimate conversion of ethanol in terms of energy. In addition, the specific energy input (SEI) for ethanol and the specific energy requirement (SER) of products (mainly H2, CO, H2 + CO) with the unit of kJ mol−1 were also calculated to evaluate the economy cost in the industrial use. (7) S E I ( ethanol ) = P ( W ) × M ethanol ( g mol − 1 ) [ ethanol ] input ( g s − 1 ) × 10 − 3 (8) S E R ( H 2 , CO , H 2 + CO ) = P ( W ) × 0.001 R [ X ] ( mol s − 1 ) where P is the input power, R [ X ] is the production rate of the substance X (mol s−1) and M ethanol is the ethanol molecular mass (g mol−1)."
4,Results and discussion,
5,V–I characteristic of the discharge,"3.1 V–I characteristic of the discharge As mentioned before, the plasma reactor was powered by a high voltage AC power supply with a transformer whose sinusoidal current is 200 mA. Fig. 3 shows the voltage–current (V–I) characteristic of the Laval nozzle arc discharge for the given air flow rate conditions, which shows the variations of the voltage and current with the time as well. The relationship between voltage and current was obtained according to the data recorded automatically by the oscilloscope, the results reveal the link between the degree of ionization and the V–I characteristic which strongly influences the amount of various plasmas. Moreover, owing to a close relationship between electric field and the voltage generated by bipolar power source, the arc filaments and electrical breakdown produced when the local electric field reaches the level of ignition of air can be indicated and estimated by the variation of voltage and current as well. From this figure, we can obtain some conclusions as follows: (1) The voltage ranging from 0 to 4.72 kV experiences a periodic change because of the periodic ignition of the discharge, while most of its values maintain in the range of 0.5 kV–1.2 kV. Basically, the profile of the current is consistent with the sinusoidal distribution; (2) It shows that the stability of voltage under the air flow rate of 555 cm3 s−1 is better than that of 1111 cm3 s−1, which indicates that the discharge is more unstable with a large air flow rate. The breakdown frequency is much higher at a higher air flow rate. (3) Generally speaking, there are four phases during one discharge period, which can also be divided to four regions as follows: (A) no ionization region; (B) full ionization region; (C) high ionization region; (D) weak ionization region. At the same time, the filaments of arc also experience a variation of four stages which can be described as: formation, elongate, quenching and regeneration. In the first phase, the voltage increases greatly without significant current increase and the current is nearly zero which means no ionization in this region, the voltage is about in the range of 0–0.5 kV. When the voltage is up to UB which is the breakdown potential characterized by the transition from phase A to B, breakdown and the relative arc filaments are generated. In phase B, the current increases rapidly with a small increase of voltage and the value of UB is about 0.5–0.7 kV. The current reaches the peak and then decreases with the increasing voltage due to the increasing resistance of plasma column while the arc filaments are elongated by the air flow, corresponding to the full ionization region and high ionization region (or recombination region) respectively. At the end of phase C, the ionization experiences a transition to phase D with a weak ionization region where the degree of ionization decreases greatly and the arc filaments disappear, while the voltage reaches the maximum of 4.72 kV and then decreases suddenly and the current decreases to about 0 mA. According to Fig. 3, we observe that the high ionization is the main phase in the plasma generation process, which has a positive effect on the generation of plasmas and electrons that can largely promote the reforming efficiency of ethanol. The discharge power in a single period can also be calculated as follows: (9) P ( W ) = ∫ 0 T U ( t ) × I ( t ) × d t T = ∫ U ( t ) × I ( t ) × frequency where the voltage U(t) and current I(t) can be measured during the operation of discharge for the carrier gas of air. P increases rapidly from 117 to 176 W when the air flow rate rises from 278 to 1111 cm3 s−1. Separate experiments were conducted to research the relationship between the power and the inlet mixture, the results show that the power slightly depends on the carrier gas mass, while strongly depends on that of the mixture of ethanol and water. In addition to this, the power has close relationship with specific plasma density which can influence the conversion rate of ethanol conversely. It will be discussed in detail in the following part."
6,Steam reforming of ethanol by Laval nozzle arc discharge,"3.2 Steam reforming of ethanol by Laval nozzle arc discharge 3.2.1 Effect of O/C ratio To investigate the effect of O/C ratio on the steam reforming performances of ethanol, the volume flow rate of air was set between 139 and 1111 cm3 s−1 with fixed fuel flow rates (0.10, 0.15, 0.20 and 0.25 g s−1 respectively) to maintain the O/C ratio ranging from 0.6 to 2.0. In this experiment, several reactions occurred during the process of syngas production. The partial oxidation can be described as: C 2 H 5 OH + 1 / 2 O 2 → 2 CO + 3 H 2 Δ H = + 20 kJ mol − 1 Furthermore, the complete oxidation can be expressed as: C 2 H 5 OH + 3 O 2 → 2 CO 2 + 3 H 2 O Δ H = − 1 280 kJ mol − 1 Firstly, for a better understanding of oxygen mass on the steam-oxidative reforming of ethanol with the LNAD reactor, several experiments were performed to learn the influences of the O/C ratio on the ethanol conversion rate. The relationship between conversion rate and O/C ratio is shown in Fig. 4 . From Fig. 4a and b, we can observe that the maximum conversion rate of ethanol 90% was found at O/C = 1.6 with S/C = 2.0 and G ethanol = 0.10 g s−1. It can be explained that not enough O2 molecules break the ethanol molecule at a low O/C ratio, resulting in a weak conversion of ethanol as well as production of syngas. As the O/C ratio increases, more heat is brought in, the reaction between ethanol and other species may be promoted greatly so that a higher conversion rate can be obtained. The main products are H2 and CO when the reaction stays in the stage of partial oxidation which is a slight endothermic reaction. The H2 and CO yield reaches the maximum when the O/C ratio is around 1.5 shown in Fig. 5 , which is higher than that of the reaction's stoichiometry. As the O/C ratio ranges from 0.8 to 1.5, both the production rates of CO and H2 undergo acceleration. According to the calculation of the water mass detected in the condenser, we know that the production of H2O increases with the O/C ratio greater than 1.5. This variation coincides basically with the change of H2 yield, which indicates that the main products' composition shifts from H2 to H2O with the O/C ratio greater than 1.5. As the O/C increases from 1.0 to 1.6 with S/C = 2.0 and G ethanol = 0.10 g s−1, the production rates of H2, CO and CO2 rise from 1.29 to 1.90, 1.13 to 1.71 and 4.40*10−1 to 5.99*10−1 mmol s−1, respectively. Simultaneously, the value of CH4 decreases from 5.11*10−1 to 4.06*10−1 mmol s−1. When the oxidation of the mixture is sufficient to initiate complete oxidation of ethanol, addition of oxygen can also further contribute to the production of CO2, which is similar to the results obtained by Petitpas et al. [16]. To study the influence of O/C ratio on the energy consumption, the term of specific energy requirement (SER) of different products (H2, CO, H2 + CO) was introduced, whose definition was given in the previous section. The energy in put with the unit of W as a function of O/C ratio is shown in Fig. 6 . The input power supplied to the plasma increases with the increasing O/C ratio under a fixed ethanol flow rate. The mass of particles generated by the mixture of ethanol solution and air is faster at a higher O/C ratio with a fixed ethanol flow rate, resulting in an increase of the breakdown frequency which can cause an increase of the input power and the amount of arc filaments as well. The breakdown frequency is not infinite, it can be limited by the power. At the same time, we also observed that the input power can experience a decrease with a high speed flow rate of pure air (above 972 cm3 s−1), it can be explained by that the particles generated from the mixture leave the high electric field without ionization within reduced residence time owing to its fast speed, which decrease the resistance in the overall ionization region. The SER of products as functions of various O/C ratios under given conditions is shown in Fig. 7 . The minimal SERs of products, 72.92 kJ mol−1 (H2), 80.20 kJ mol−1 (CO) and 38.19 kJ mol−1 (CO + H2) respectively, were obtained at O/C = 1.4 and S/C = 2.0 with the ethanol flow rate of 0.15 g s−1, which were lower than the data reported by Yukhymenko et al. [33]. Different from the case of S/C = 2.0, the SER of each product of S/C = 2.4 increases with the increase of O/C ratio initially, reaching the maximum at O/C = 1.2 and the minimum at O/C = 1.6 respectively. Note that there are several cases happened when increasing the O/C ratio. Firstly, as mentioned before, the input power would ascend with the increase of the O/C ratio with a constant ethanol flow rate for the increasing amounts of arc filaments between electrodes and particles generated by the feedstock. Secondly, more energy should be supplied for the increasing conversion of ethanol and heat which increased together with the injection of oxygen as discussed before. Moreover, it is possible that more excitation or fragmentation of products form with the increase of oxygen, which caused more unnecessary energy consumption. Combining Fig. 5 with the value of power calculated by the equation (9), we can observe that as the O/C ratio increases, the input power keeps rising while the H2 or CO yield increases initially and then decreases from O/C = 1.6. Generally speaking, the variation of power has a dynamic change with the increasing O/C ratio. When the acceleration of the power exceeds that of the production rate of products, the SER would increase, and vice versa. Thus, we obtained that the minimum SER occur at O/C = 1.4 or 1.6 with S/C = 2.0 or 2.4, respectively. In a non-equilibrium plasma reactor, the entire energy is deposited into the electron component. The active species, generated in the electron-molecular processes, lead to chain reactions with ethanol molecules [34]. In the future, more studies should be done to further illustrate the conversion mechanism of ethanol reforming assisted by plasmas, especially the main radical reactions converting ethanol to hydrogen. 3.2.2 Effect of S/C ratio The ethanol steam reforming C 2 H 5 OH + H 2 O → 2 CO + 4 H 2 Δ H = + 256 kJ mol − 1 occurs when H2O is used as an oxidizer to produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide as products. Combining this reaction with WGS reaction, H 2 O + CO → CO 2 + H 2 Δ H = − 41 kJ mol − 1 it could be integrated to the following reaction: C 2 H 5 OH + 3 H 2 O → 2 CO 2 + 6 H 2 Δ H = + 174 kJ mol − 1 The S/C ratio is one of the most important factors affecting the conversion of ethanol, especially the production of hydrogen. The influence of S/C ratio on the production rates of H2 and CO is shown in Fig. 8 . The production rate of H2 was up to maximum of about 1.90 mmol s−1 at S/C = 2.0 with the O/C ratio and the fuel flow rate of 1.6 and 0.10 g s−1 respectively, while the value of CO increases more slowly than hydrogen with the increasing S/C ratio initially. As the S/C ratio increases, oxygen radical and hydroxyl radical from the water molecules become more active to transfer the energy and collide with ethanol molecules to promote its decomposition [11], leading to an increase of syngas production shown in Fig. 8. When the addition of water increases with S/C greater than 2.0, the production rates of H2 and CO decrease. One possible reason may be that the additional water absorbed some heat released from the partial oxidation of ethanol, resulting in a decrease of the temperature in the reactor which has negative effects on the ethanol conversion. The mole H2/CO as a function of the inlet S/C ratio is displayed in Fig. 9 . From both Figs. 8 and 9, we observe that the mole ratio of H2 and CO reaches the peak at the S/C ratio of 2.0–2.4. It indicates that the addition of water is in favour of steam reforming of ethanol and H2 production. From the Fig. 9, as the S/C ratio varies from 0.8 to 4.0 with other operating parameters kept constant, the mole ratio of H2 and CO increases up to the maximum of 1.14 at S/C = 2.0. Moreover, we can see that the mole ratio exceeds unity with the S/C ratio in the range of 2.0–2.4 at G ethanol = 0.10 g s−1. It could be explained by the free radicals concentration as well as the water–gas shift reaction which has a favourable H2 equilibrium under conditions of large amounts of water added and low temperature. Note that for temperature lower than 1000 K in the investigated mixtures, hydrogen atoms are produced mainly during the process of water dissociation by electron impact [19]: H 2 O + e → H + OH + e For the initial time, hydrogen is mainly generated in the process: C 2 H 5 OH + H → C 2 H 5 O + H 2 Moreover, the WGS reaction plays a dominant role in the H2 production outside of electric discharge [32]. The significant effect of WGS reaction may be the promotion of CO2 formation with the decrease of CO and the increase of H2, leading to the increase of H2 production rate by a faster speed. Then it causes an increase of the mole ratio of H2/CO. Ideally, plasma assisting the partial oxidation and the steam reforming of ethanol can not only take advantages of the extra H2 produced by the WGS reaction and the heat generated by total oxidation, but also make good use of the plasmas generated by discharge, which has a potential to produce very high ethanol conversion rate, hydrogen selectivity and yield. 3.2.3 Effect of the input power The input power is a key parameter affecting the performance of the reactor system, it can be adjusted by varying the applied voltage and pulsed frequency. Goujard et al. [35] studied the influence of the input power on the performance of the reactor system, obtaining that the conversion of biogas increased by increasing the power supply regardless of changing voltage or frequency. In our work, the input power of a fixed frequency as a function of the ethanol conversion rate has been studied to learn the influence of power on the steam-oxidative reforming of ethanol, the results indicate that there is a positive correlation between the conversion rate and the input power, as shown in Fig. 10 . This experiment were performed using a mixture of water, air and ethanol at O/C = 1.2, S/C = 2.0 and 3.2 respectively. From Fig. 10, we can see that the ethanol conversion rate significantly was affected by the input power. In addition, the H2 yield slightly decreases with the increasing discharge power. Future work on by-product analysis is necessary and is currently underway [18]. As mentioned before, the power has close relationship with the density of plasma and almost the entire energy is deposited into the electron in the non-thermal plasma. A large amount of active species can be generated from the reaction of electron and molecular, resulting in the decomposition of ethanol. Among them, the well-known fast reactions between ethanol molecules and active species are as follows: C 2 H 5 OH + O → C 2 H 5 O + OH Δ H = 6 . 2 kJ mol − 1 C 2 H 5 OH + OH → C 2 H 5 O + H 2 O Δ H = − 65.4 kJ mol − 1 Other reactions occurred between ethanol molecules and electrons directly mainly include: C 2 H 5 OH + e → CH 3 + CH 2 OH + e C 2 H 5 OH + e → C 2 H 5 + OH + e C 2 H 5 OH + e → C 2 H 5 OH + + 2 e The increasing power has a positive effect on the conversion of ethanol owing to the increasing plasma density especially the density of electrons. Moreover, considering the special way of ethanol injection that the ethanol/water could be sprayed by the gas–liquid nozzle, the ethanol can exist in the form of liquid droplets which was less subject to interaction with the surrounding plasmas compared with the ethanol of gas phase. Since an additional amount of ethanol and water of liquid phase was contained with a higher flow rate of ethanol at a fixed S/C ratio, a lower energy of the plasma is not sufficient to complete vaporization of the liquid droplet, leading to a lower conversion of ethanol because the chemical yield in the presence of liquid droplets is expected to be relatively small. 3.2.4 Effect of the ethanol flow rate From Fig. 4, we can observe that the conversion rate of ethanol decreased with the increasing flow rate, for all the O/C ratios tested with fixed S/C ratio and fuel flow rate. This can be explained by two reasons. On one hand, the flow rate of mixture, which would be higher at a higher ethanol flow rate under a fixed O/C ratio, induces less reaction time. Owing to a decrease of residence time and reactive time of the mixture, the ethanol conversion rate would decrease. The residence time was a critical parameter affecting ethanol reforming and hydrogen generation. But note that a higher flow rate means more syngas may be produced in the process as shown in Fig. 11 . On the other hand, the energy used in per ethanol molecule decomposition reduces when the input power is fixed at constant value, which directly reduces the number of decomposed ethanol molecules and leads to a decrease on ethanol conversion and H2 yield [11]. Fig. 11 shows the results of production rates of syngas in the reforming process performed for four values of ethanol flow rate of 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 and 0.25 g s−1, in comparison with experimental data at different O/C ratios of 1.0 and 1.2 with S/C = 2.0. From it one can see that in the case of O/C = 1.0, while the ethanol flow rate rises from 0.10 to 0.25 g s−1, the measured H2 and CO production rate increases from 1.29 × 10−3 to 2.56 × 10−3 mol s−1 and 1.13 × 10−3 to 2.40 × 10−3 mol s−1 respectively. A similar variation of production rate was obtained in the case of O/C = 1.2. From it, we can conclude that more ethanol is decomposed within unit time at a higher fuel flow rate, leading to a higher H2 or CO production rate. The detailed reasons may be that a larger amount of ethanol molecules, contained in the reforming process with a higher ethanol flow rate, results in an increase of the collision frequency between the ethanol molecules and surrounding plasmas so as to rise the production rate of H2 and CO. Locke et al. [18] have studied the hydrogen production rate as a function of liquid (methanol) flow rate and liquid composition, observing that the production rate and corresponding energy yields gradually increase with increasing flow rate. One reason given by the researcher is that perhaps the corresponding lower residence times allows for more rapid quenching and suppression of radical reactions that might destroy the product [18]. Dependence of energy consumption on ethanol flow rate is presented in Fig. 12 . The minimum SER of H2 and CO of 115.03 kJ mol−1 and 112.30 kJ mol−1 were achieved at specific energy input of 36.8 kJ per ethanol mole with S/C = 1.6 and O/C = 1.2 at G ethanol = 0.25 g s−1. This SEI correspond to a power of approximately 200 W, 69% ethanol conversion and an air flow rate of 694 cm3 s−1."
7,Comparison of ethanol reforming by different plasma reactors,"3.3 Comparison of ethanol reforming by different plasma reactors Interesting results are exhibited in Table 1 by comparing the reforming of ethanol by LNAD with other plasma reactors. The ethanol conversion, H2 yield, H2 selectivity, SER of H2, input power, H2 formation rate, energy efficiency, as defined in equations above, seemed to be good indicators for estimating the reforming efficiency of ethanol for hydrogen production. Note that some values claimed here maybe a little different from those reported by the authors in their papers and proceedings. Table 1 illustrates several important parameters mentioned above for evaluating the ethanol reforming assisted by different plasma reactors. The table concludes the plasma device as well as the institution and country involved in the development of the plasma technology. Conversion rate is a parameter indicating that how much hydrocarbons has gone though the plasma region and how much C–H links have been “broken” [17]. From Table 1, we can observe that the ethanol conversion rate has a range going from 20% to 100% and the highest values correspond to the non-thermal plasma discharge by University of Oklahoma (USA) and the microwave surface-wave plasma discharge by CSIC. The Laval nozzle arc discharge in our work can achieve a high value with 90%. Moreover, a very high H2 yield between 76% and 111% was also achieved by Oklahoma University with energy efficiency ranging from 51 to 64%, while the ethanol mass reformed by the discharge in unit time is much lower than other reactors. The specific energy requirement (SER) of hydrogen is widely spread from 5 to 1000 MJ kg−1, which is an indicator of how well the heat released by the plasma is used into the reforming reaction. A good SER of H2 with a value of 36 MJ kg−1 was achieved by our plasma reactor under some specified conditions. Moreover, note that the maximum of energy efficiency of 89.3% is achieved by Waseda University with the lower energy plasma (LEP) discharge, while the fuel flow rate reformed by plasma has a similar magnitude order of mg s−1 with the work done by Oklahoma University. Generally speaking, it seems very promising in terms of the reforming capacity, ethanol conversion rate and the SER of H2 for the reforming process of bio-ethanol with our novel LNAD plasma reactor. This comparison indicates that the plasma assisted reforming of ethanol is a competitive way to produce the syngas. As the traditional gliding arc discharge is always a two dimensional one or pure three tornado-type, leading to a weak conversion rate or a little higher energy consumption because of the small part of mixtures going though the arc or lower electron density, our novel reactor experiences a high conversion rate for its subsonic three-dimensional tornado-type. Moreover, it should be noted that the emission of nitrogen oxide (NO and NO2) produced in the reforming process by LNAD is much lower than that assisted by other discharges, its content in products is lower than 10 ppm. Future studies on increasing the H2 yield and reducing CO selectively in the products are necessary in order to enhance the reforming efficiency and limit the concentration of CO for fuel cells application."
8,Conclusions,"The steam-oxidative reforming of ethanol was studied using a novel gliding arc reactor named Laval nozzle arc discharge(LNAD) for hydrogen production at the O/C ratio of 0.6–2.0, the S/C ratio of 0.8–4.0, fuel flow rate of 0.10 g s−1–0.30 g s−1 and atmospheric pressure. The mixture of ethanol and water were converted to the synthesis gas with C2H2, C2H4, CH4 and CO2, CO and H2 were detected as the main compounds. The significant conclusions were as follows: (1) With the increase of the O/C ratio while other parameters keeping constant, the maximum conversion of ethanol reached 90% at O/C = 1.6 with S/C = 2.0 and G ethanol = 0.10 g s−1. (2) When the O/C ratio and the ethanol flow rate kept 1.0 and 0.10 g s−1 respectively, the production rate of H2 was up to maximum of 1.29 mmol s−1 at S/C = 2.0. (3) The minimal SERs of products, 72.92 kJ mol−1 (H2), 80.20 kJ mol−1 (CO) and 38.19 kJ mol−1 (CO + H2) respectively, were obtained at O/C = 1.4 and S/C = 2.0 with the ethanol flow rate of 0.15 g s−1. (4) The emission of nitrogen oxide produced in the reforming process of bio-ethanol by LNAD is lower than 10 ppm. Non-thermal reforming of bio-ethanol for onboard application is relevant to good H2 yield, reactive system, compactness, sulphur presence or high temperature, so the further research focussing on the reforming technologies which combines the plasma with the conventional catalytic technology would play a dominant role. The cheaper catalysts with extended lifetimes will be of great interest for the steam reforming of ethanol. In addition, some other methods may be feasible to improve the conversion efficiency of ethanol, such as changing the compositions of carrier gas favoured the reforming reaction, adding a small amount of additives catalyzing the conversion of ethanol or making a microcirculation of produced hydrogen and so on. Note that the addition of some nano-materials which have catalytic effects on the ethanol reforming may be an effective way to reduce the volatility of ethanol, improve the hydrogen selectivity, reduce nitrogen oxide emissions, inhibit soot formation and improve combustion efficiency. In addition to this, further efforts to optimize the reactor geometry and select optimal electrode material are necessary so as to achieve better efficiency of ethanol reforming. In the near future, the attention would be paid on investigating the fundamental mechanisms of plasma-assisted fuel conversion as well, especially the main radical reactions converting ethanol to hydrogen. As the flexibility and effectiveness of this novel gliding arc discharge, the LNAD reactor can be used in some area such as plasma ignition and flame control, hydrocarbon decomposition for the generation of carbon nano-tubes, fuel reforming and activation, use in the solar cell manufacturing process and so on."
