0,Introduction,"Metal deterioration is a common self-discovery phenomenon on metals while under corrosive environment. When exposing to humid, high temperature, acidic and alkaline environments, metal corrosion is occurred by dissolving the respective ions [1–4]. Coating technologies are widely used to improve the metal corrosion resistance compared to other technologies [5–7]. Most traditional coating technologies are organic solvents, which affect the environment and human health. Therefore, new non-toxic and environmentally friendly water-based coating systems have been proposed [8–10]. In order to solve the shortcomings of hydrophilic polar bonds in water-based coatings, which form hydrophilic corrosion pathways after curing, resulting in poor corrosion resistance, forming excellent corrosion-resistant materials on water-based coatings is carried out [11–16]. Graphene has a two-dimensional structure with a thickness of several atoms, which provides acid and alkali resistance, large specific surface area and high barrier properties, has been widely applied on improving metal corrosion resistance [17,18]. However, graphene is inclined to agglomerate in water-based coatings due to its large specific surface area. In order to solve the dispersion problem, researchers began to focus on GO with various hydrophilic functional groups, which promote the uniform dispersion of GO in water-based coatings [19,20]. In addition, polymer-based coatings have strong bonding properties with metal surface which acted as barriers during metal corrosion. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a non-toxic hydrophilic polymer with excellent film-forming properties, which can be firmly attached to metal surfaces [21–23]. It can effectively reduce the generation of bubbles and pores during the coating film forming process [24,25]. Compounding with GO remarkably improves the intermolecular binding force, increases the density of the coating, and thus leads to excellent corrosion resistance [26,27]. However, the hydrophilic polar bonds are difficult to completely consume, and it is easy to form a hydrophilic corrosion path, which will damage the coating structure and damage the substrate after the water-based coating is cured into a film. To solve the shortcomings mentioned above, a new film former technology is presented in the study, which uses PVA to produce waterborne epoxy resins, use GO as a corrosion inhibitor, and use an appropriate amount of crosslinking agent (GA) to improve the crosslinking reaction of waterborne coatings, thereby improving the corrosion resistance. The results demonstrated that the crosslinking agent effectively increase the curing crosslinking density of the coating as well as improve the flatness of the coating."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials GO was prepared in our own laboratory with improved Hummers method by ourselves. The preparation method and physicochemical characterization of GO are shown in our published literature [28]. Polyvinyl alcohol(PVA), Glutaraldehyde (GA, 5%) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4,98%) were made by Aladdin company. Water emulsion epoxy resin (3EE101W) was purchased from Guangzhou Tongde Chemical Co., Ltd. Q235 was from China Iron and Steel Research Institute."
3,"Preparation of W-EP, W-EZP, W-EPGO and W-EZPGO coatings","2.2 Preparation of W-EP, W-EZP, W-EPGO and W-EZPGO coatings 1 g of PVA was dissolved in deionized water with the temperature of 90 °C in water bath. After dissolving and cooling, 1 g of PVA was used as a curing agent and film-forming agent for water-based epoxy resin and GO/water-based epoxy resin. The mass ratio of PVA to waterborne epoxy resin emulsion is 0.5:1 and the optimal dosage of GO is 0.5% of the water-based epoxy resin emulsion. Adding an appropriate amount of glutaraldehyde and a small amount of concentrated sulfuric acid to the mixed solution and stirring at room temperature for two hours. The bubbles are then removed statically. The composite coating was applied on the steel plate that the surface has been pretreated and then cured in a vacuum drying oven at 70 °C.PVA cured waterborne epoxy resin and GO/waterborne epoxy resin coatings are named W-EP and W-EPGO respectively. The composite coating with cross-linking agent and concentrated sulfuric acid was named W-EZP and W-EZPGO."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The successful cross-linking of PVA, GO with waterborne epoxy resin was verified by using a Nicolet AVATAR-330 FTIR spectrometer (America) and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) (ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer). The FTIR spectra were collected in the range of 500–4000 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1. The morphologies of W-EP, W-EZP, W-EPGO and W-EZPGO were observed by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with ZEISS-6035 field emission scanning electron microscope. The W-EP, W-EZP, W-EPGO and W-EZPGO samples were analyzed by the Brooke XD8 ADVANCE A25 X-ray diffractometer (XRD), in a scan speed of 0.2°min−1 and increment step size of 0.02 in the range from 5° to 90°. The thermal stability was assessed using TG analyser (STA449F3/DSC200F3*) at 10 °C/min up to 700 °C under N2 atmosphere. The corrosion resistant properties of W-EP, W-EZP, W-EPGO and W-EZPGO composite coatings were evaluated by using electrochemical workstation (Model: CHI660C) in 3.5% NaCl solution. The electrochemical measurements were performed by a conventional three-electrode system using W-EP, W-EZP, W-EPGO or W-EZPGO coated steel plate sample as working electrode. The saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used for comparison and the platinum electrode was used as the auxiliary electrode. Prior to electrochemical corrosion studies, E-t tests were carried out by stabilizing in 3.5% NaCl solution for 1 h. The polarization measurements were carried out by fixing the scan rate at 2 mV/s. Tafel method was utilized analyze the corrosion potential (Ecorr), the corrosion current density (Icoor), polarization resistance (Rp), etc. Moreover, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopic measurements were carried out at a frequency range of 1 × 106 to 1 × 10−1 Hz."
5,Details of quantum mechanics modeling,"2.4 Details of quantum mechanics modeling To investigate the effect of crosslinking reaction on the structure of coating and the effect of coating structure on corrosion resistance. The interactions between polyvinyl alcohol and graphene oxide (GO-PVA) and three kinds of cross-linked polyvinyl alcohol and graphene oxide (GO-PVA-GDH) were studied, and the clusters of GO-PVA and GO-PVA-GDH were calculated by theoretical quantum mechanics (QM) [29–31]. The geometries were subjected to optimization carried out using density functional theory (DFT) method with M06-2X functional in conjunction with 6-31G (d, p) basis set. All QM computations were done using program Gaussian 16 [32], and added DFT-D3 dispersion correction. The simulated temperature is 70 °C."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Synthesis and characterization,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization The XRD diffraction peaks of W-EP, W-EZP, W-EPGO and W-EZPGO are shown in Fig. 1 . Compared to W-EP (2θ = 20°), the diffraction peaks of W-EZP, W-EPGO and W-EZPGO coatings shift to 19.5°, which indicates the production of crosslinking agent and GO. The peak widths of W-EZP and W-EZPGO are smaller than those of W-EP and W-EPGO coatings, which may be attributed to the increasing of the cross-linking reaction. The crosslinking agent and GO increase the intermolecular bonding strength, improve the compactness of the coating structure as well as the order of the coating, thus improving the uniform dispersion of GO after crosslinking. The infrared spectrum of the synthesized composite coating material is described in Fig. 2 . For W-EP sample, the stretching vibration peak of the OH group appears near 3423 cm−1 due to the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds. A characteristic peak appeared at 2932 and 828 cm−1, which may be caused by the asymmetric stretching vibration of the CH group. The peak at 1509 cm−1 is attributed to the bending vibration of CH2 group. The cross-linking agent promotes the compound chemical bonding, improves the intermolecular interaction force, and enhances the CO tensile vibration in W-EZP and W-EZPGO composite materials. It is difficult to detect the presence of double bonds in the infrared spectra of W-EZP and W-EZPGO coatings, since the content of double bonds is low, and the crosslinking reaction consumes aldehyde double bonds compared to other chemical bonds in the polymer. The addition of GA improves the cross-linking reaction of the coating, enhances the interaction between molecules and COC infrared contraction peaks at 1246 and 1037 cm−1. These improvements may be contributed to the increasing intensity of the infrared vibration contraction peak since crosslinking agent (GA) promotes the cross-linking reaction and improves the intermolecular binding force. The chemical composition of W-EP (a-a1), W-EZP (b-b1) and W-EZPGO (c-c1) was analyzed in the range of 0 to 1200 eV by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement, (Fig. 3 ). It exist two peaks of 284.6 eV and 533 eV for the four coatings, corresponding to the O1s peak and the C1s peak respectively. In order to further observe the functional groups and valence structure existing in the coating, the C1s spectrum of W-EP was fitted to two peak positions with binding energies of 284.6 eV and 286.6 eV, corresponding to the two combined forms of CC and CO that exist in the cured water-based resin (Fig. 3 (a1)). Since the aldehyde double bond of the cross-linking agent glutaraldehyde is consumed during the cross-linking process, the C1s spectrum of W-EZP only has two peaks at 284.6 eV and 286.5 eV, corresponding to the two combined forms of CC and CO (Fig. 3 (b1)). When the corrosion inhibitor material GO is added to the coating, three peaks of 284.6 eV, 286.6 eV and 288.6 eV can be found in the C1s spectrum of the W-EPGO coating, corresponding to CC, CO and the CO double bond of GO (Fig. 3 (c1)). Due to the strong cross-linking reaction in W-EZPGO coating, the CO double bond of GO is relatively small, and the aldehyde double bond of crosslinking agent is consumed in the process of cross-linking, it is difficult to observe the existence of CO double bond in C1s spectrum of W-EZPGO coating. The fitting peaks are 284.6 eV and 286.6 eV, corresponding to CC and CO in coating (Fig. 3 (d1)). The crosslinking and curing reaction diagram of W-EZPGO coating is depicted in Fig. 4 . According to the reaction mechanism of polyvinyl acetal, the crosslinking reaction of PVA, GA, GO and water-based resin can be divided into intermolecular crosslinking and intramolecular crosslinking. Each cross-linking reaction is free and random. Glutaraldehyde (GA) could be added inside the coating and thus cause an acetal reaction, leading to the increasing of cross-linking reaction of the coating. The internal structure gradually became dense. Aldehydes and carboxyl groups are consumed in the curing and crosslinking reaction, forming a large amount of C-O-C. It can be seen from the reaction mechanism of the W-EZPGO coating that the average molecular weight of the product increases, and the polymer chain becomes larger and cumbersome, forming a network structure, reducing free volume and hydrophilicity, and improving barrier properties."
8,Quantum mechanics calculations,"3.2 Quantum mechanics calculations For exploring the interaction between graphene oxide and cross-linked polyvinyl alcohol, first explored the binding energy of vinyl alcohol monomer and graphene oxide at different sites. The binding energy is calculated with the formula ΔEbinding = EGO/PVA − (EGO + EPVA). EGO/PVA represents the optimized electronic energy of vinyl alcohol monomer and graphene oxide, EGO represents the optimized electronic energy of graphene oxide, and EPVA represents the optimized electronic energy of vinyl alcohol monomer. Eight different sites are selected for calculation. The initial conformation, final conformation, and binding energy are shown below in Fig. 5 . (The calculation results are expressed as GO-PVA-1, …, GO-PVA-8.) In order to explore the interaction between GO and Polyvinyl alcohol monomer, multiple sites were selected for QM calculation. The interaction of each binding form is basically the same, which proves that no matter what the binding form of GO and PVA is, the interaction force is relatively limited. The interaction between GO and PVA is weak, ΔEbinding (MAXGO-PVA-7) was only −19.49 kcal/mol. Weak interaction will lead to poor structure density of the coating, which makes GO easy to peel off when it is corroded. GO will interact with three kinds of cross-linked body, which were formed by glutaraldehyde and polyvinyl alcohol acetal reaction. The binding energy is expressed by ΔEbinding = EGO/PVA-GDH-(EGO + EPVA/GDH). EGO/PVA-GDH represents the optimized electronic energy of graphene oxide and cross-linked body, EGO represents the optimized electronic energy of graphene oxide, and EPVA/GDH represents the optimized electronic energy of cross-linked body. (The calculation results are expressed as PVA/GDH-GO-1, PVA/GDH-GO-2, PVA/GDH-GO-3.) The binding energies derived from QM computations are also presented in Fig. 6 for GO and three kinds of PVA cross-linked body. According to the computed ΔEbinding data, it is evident that three binding energies are negative, which from a quantitative perspective evidences the GO binding to three kinds of cross-linked body. The comparison with PVA monomer shows that no matter what kind of crosslinking body interacts with GO, its force is stronger than that of Polyvinyl alcohol monomer. The results of QM calculation are consistent with those of IR and XPS analysis, which further indicates that increasing the cross-linking reaction of the coating will increase the interaction between GO and PVA, thus increasing the structural density of the coating. Moreover, the dense coating structure will effectively improve the corrosion resistance of the coating."
9,Coating performance,"3.3 Coating performance 3.3.1 Thermal properties The thermal stability of the coating was analyzed by TG. For PVA-cured waterborne epoxy resin, due to the difficulties of dehydration and condensation of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups at room temperature, large number of hydrophilic functional groups appeared in the cured coating. The weight loss of W-EP and W-EPGO thermal spectra observed between 231 °C and 272 °C were ~6 and ~6.5 wt%, respectively, which correspond to the physical/chemical retention of solvents and water in Fig. 7 . Since crosslinking agent improves the crosslinking reaction during curing, resulting in the reduction of water absorption of the coating (the weight loss of W-EZP and W-EZPGO is only 2.5 wt%), indicating that the crosslinking of the coating is increased by increasing the hydrophobicity of the coating. The main weight loss range of all composite materials is 400–500 °C. It can be observed from Fig. 7 that it only contains one decomposition stage, which is mainly attributed to the loss of quality of the water-based epoxy resin. It can be found that the heat resistance of the coating by adding crosslinking agent and GO is better than other samples. The results show that the water absorption and heat resistance of the coating are improved by increasing the cross-linking reaction when the coating is cured. The main reason is that GO is not only a high temperature resistant material, but also has a strong interaction with cross-linked PVA. And a complex cross-linked structure is formed in the W-EZPGO coating through hydrogen bonding, thereby increasing the binding force between molecules and promoting the temperature required for thermal decomposition. 3.3.2 EIS measurements Bode and Nyquist plot for W-EP (a) (a1), W-EZP (b) (b1), W-EPGO (c) (c1) and W-EZOGO (d) (d1) coatings obtained during immersion in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution up to 30 days. The equivalent circuit used to fit impedance results is shown in Fig. 8 , where Rs represents solution resistance, Rc represents coating resistance, Rcs represents charge transfer resistance, and CPEc and CPEdl represent coating non-ideal capacitance and double-layer non-ideal capacitance, respectively. The test curves of the coatings are shown in Fig. 8, it can be seen from Fig. 8 (a, b, c, and d) that the capacitance arc of the coating is improved by adding GO. Furthermore, the capacitive reactance arc of the coating is increased by an order of magnitude, and the capacitive reactance arc is doubled by adding cross-linking. Thus, under the joint action of crosslinking agent and GO, the capacitance arc of W-EZPGO coating (Fig. 8 d) is two orders of magnitude higher than that of W-EP coating (Fig. 8 a). The improvements are attributed to the highly hindered corrosion inhibitor of GO, which effectively block the movement of corrosion medium and delay the occurrence of corrosion reaction. The crosslinking agent further increases the density of the coating and improves the crosslinking reaction during curing. Moreover, the reaction between the crosslinking agent and GO form a complex cross-linking structure, resulting in the increasing of the interaction force between the coating molecules and the reduction of coating defects and thus improve the corrosion resistance [33–36]. It can be seen from Fig. 8 (a1, b1, c1 and d1) that the impedance mode |Z| 0.1 Hz of W-EPGO and W-EZPGO coating reaches 105 Ω·cm2, which is higher than that of 104 Ω·cm2 after 30 days. These two layers have a stable platform in the first and late stages, and increase with the increase of soaking time in the later stage. However, carefully comparing Fig. 8 (a1) and (c1), it can be found that the increase of cross-linking reaction slow down the attenuation of impedance, and produce an impedance plateau at the early stage of immersion, resulting in the weakening of the attenuation mode from the early stage to the late stage. W-EZPGO coating has the highest stable high impedance mode in the initial stage and high frequency region, and its impedance mode attenuation is the slowest. The reason is that the structure of the coating is more stable than that of the crosslinking agent. When the corrosive medium penetrates into the coating, it is hindered by GO, but also subject to greater internal constraints [37,38]. The residence time in the coating increases, which limits the movement time and speed of corrosive medium. Therefore, the addition of crosslinking agent and GO can improve the compactness and high barrier performance of the coating, enhance the curing crosslinking reaction of the coating, prevent the diffusion of corrosive medium and delay the corrosion time. Therefore, W-EZPGO coating has excellent corrosion resistance. 3.3.3 E-T curve measurements The electrochemical time potential test of the coating is shown in Fig. 9 . It can be seen from Fig. 9 (a) that all four coating materials have high equilibrium potential. In addition to the addition of GO can improve the stable voltage of the coating, compared with the coating before and after adding crosslinking agent, it is found that the compact structure of the coating is improved, and the stable voltage of the coating is also affected. The greater the cross-linking reaction is, the higher the voltage of the coating is. After multiple measurements, the average potential of the four coatings is shown in Fig. 9 (b). The coating voltage with GO is higher than that without. Among them, the stable voltage of W-EZPGO is the highest with almost no voltage fluctuation, and the stable voltage is 0.41 V. The voltage of W-EZP is 0.21 V, which is higher than that of the coating without crosslinking agent. The results show that the addition of crosslinking agent can improve the stable voltage of the coating, the crosslinking reaction is high and the coating structure is compact. The introduction of GO not only improves the crosslinking complexity of the coating, but also increases the adhesion between molecules. The dense coating structure will make the corrosion medium constrained by the coating, and the corrosion rate will be reduced when trapped in the coating, thus delaying the corrosion time and achieving long-term high-efficiency corrosion resistance. This is consistent with the impedance analysis. 3.3.4 Potentiodynamic polarization curve To further investigate the corrosion mechanism, Potentiodynamic polarization curve and Tafel test have been performed. The protective efficiency and the corrosion rate of W-EP, W-EZP, W-EPGO and W-EZPGO were determined from the Tafel analysis in Fig. 10 (a). The protective efficiency and the corrosion rate of the bare steel, W-EP, W-EZP, W-EPGO and W-EZPGO coatings were determined from the corrosion current density (Icoor) and corrosion potential (Ecorr) obtained from the Tafel plot. It can be seen from Fig. 10 (b) that with the addition of crosslinking agent and GO, the self-corrosion current of the coating gradually decreases and the self-corrosion potential increases. The self-corrosion current of W-EP coating is 1.56 μA/cm−2, and two orders of magnitude smaller than that of pure steel plate. The results show that PVA as curing agent of waterborne resin can make the coating have excellent corrosion resistance. The corrosion current of W-EPGO coating is 0.99 μA/cm−2, which is one order of magnitude lower than that of W-EP, while the corrosion current of W-EZPGO is four orders of magnitude smaller than that of pure steel plate and two orders of magnitude smaller than that of W-EP. The results show that the addition of crosslinking agent and GO can improve the corrosion resistance of the coating, and the combination of the two can improve the corrosion resistance of the coating. The main reason is that the crosslinking agent can improve the cross-linking reaction of the coating, and the introduction of GO not only plays a role of corrosion resistant material, but also makes the cross-linking of coating more complex and diversified. The protective corrosion resistance of the coating can also be calculated by the polarization resistance and the protection efficiency. RP of the coating is calculated according to the Stern Geary equation [39–41]. (1) Rp = β a β b 2.303 β a − β b I coor The βa and βb are the Tafel slope of the anode and cathode, respectively. The PE can be calculated according to equation [42,43]. (2) P E % = I coor uncoated − I coor coated I coor uncoated × 100 % Obtained results are also given in Table 1 . Using polyvinyl alcohol as a curing agent for waterborne epoxy resins can effectively reduce the corrosion current by several orders of magnitude. The addition of cross-linking agent and GO further increases the density of the coating, the bonding force between molecules is improved, the conductivity is reduced, the corrosion current is gradually reduced, and it shows an order of magnitude reduction trend. The main reason is that polyvinyl alcohol has excellent film-forming properties, the coating is smooth and has few defects, and the addition of crosslinking agent also increases the crosslink density. The presence of GO can be used as a corrosion-resistant material for filling coatings [44,45], and it can also carry out complex cross-linking reactions with PVA, GA and water-based resins, thereby increasing the complexity and diversity of cross-linking and making the average molecular weight of the product increase. And the polymer chain becomes larger and cumbersome, which can form a network structure to reducing free volume and hydrophilicities. The minimum corrosion current of W-EZPGO is 0.098 μA/cm−2 and the maximum corrosion voltage is 0.45 V, which has the largest polarization resistance and the highest protection efficiency (99.99%). 3.3.5 Salt spray test Corrosion tests were performed on the cured coating of PVA. The corrosion resistance test was carried out in 3.5% NaCl solution. The SEM morphology is described in Fig. 11 . Before the test, Infrared analysis shows that the hydrophilic functional groups of waterborne epoxy coatings are difficult to be completely consumed after curing. The contact angles of the four coatings are shown in the figure. The addition of GO and cross-linking agent can reduce the hydrophilicity of the coating. The contact angle of W-EZPGO coating reaches 86°, and the coating shows better hydrophobicity. A large number of hydrophilic bonds in the coating participate in the crosslinking reaction of GO, PVA and waterborne epoxy resin promoted by crosslinking agent. The hydrophilic functional groups of the coating are difficult to be consumed by complete crosslinking, and there are still a small amount of residues. Therefore, the contact angle of W-EZPGO composite coating is infinitely close to 90°. It can be seen from Fig. 11 (a) that after soaking in the W-EP coating for 30 days, the surface of the coating is invaded by a large amount of corrosive medium, presenting a uniform and comprehensive corrosion pit, and a large number of spalling phenomena appear on the coating surface. The formation of corrosion defects destroyed the integrity of the coating structure. As shown in Fig. 11 (b), due to the addition of crosslinking agent, the hydrophilic polar bond will be further consumed. At this time, although the coating is invaded by corrosive medium, there is no spalling phenomenon. Due to the dense structure of W-EP coating, the corrosive medium is stuck on the surface of the coating, so it is difficult to invade into the interior of the coating. However, the corrosive medium attached to the coating will cause stress and deformation on the surface of the coating, resulting in surface roughness and wrinkling, as well as more corrosion defects. In Fig. 11 (c) and (d), GO can be observed in both W-EPGO and W-EZPGO coatings, and the corrosion defects of the coatings are very small. For W-EZPGO coating, due to its dense structure, almost no corrosion medium is attached, hydrophilic functional groups of the coating are consumed, the water absorption capacity of the coating is weakened, the corrosion dissolution rate of the coating is slow, and the corrosion resistance of the coating is strong. The corrosion diagrams of the four coatings are shown in Fig. 12 . As the cross-linking reaction increases, the interaction force between the intermolecular in the coating increases, which gradually narrows the corrosion path. In W-EZPGO coating, GO and the cross-linked PVA have the strongest intermolecular interaction. The dense coating structure leads to a narrow corrosion path. Besides, the presence of GO can also effectively hinder the movement of corrosive media and further improve the corrosion resistance of the coating. The main reason is that the crosslinking agent improves the cross-linking reaction and forms a complex cross-linking structure with GO. The internal complex cross-linking will further restrict the diffusion of corrosive medium, thus prolonging the diffusion time of the medium. In addition, due to the complex cross-linking reaction in the curing process, it is difficult for the corrosive medium to contact the base metal, thus avoiding the occurrence of electrochemical corrosion. This is also consistent with the contact angle test and electrochemical analysis."
10,Conclusions,"In the present study, polyvinyl alcohol-cured waterborne epoxy resin endowed excellent flat and smooth coating surface as well as increased intermolecular interaction with graphene oxide by crosslinking agent, leading to further improvement of the compact coating structure. Graphene oxide improves the corrosion resistance of the coating as well as increases the complexity of crosslinking effectively. For W-EZPGO coating, the arc and corrosion voltage of the capacitor is significantly increased, resulting in smaller corrosion current of 0.098 μA/cm−2, the polarization resistance is increased to several orders of magnitude, and the protection efficiency reaches 99.99%. As a summary, QM simulation theoretical calculations have also verified that improving the cross-linking reaction during the curing process and promoting the interaction between molecules in the coating is an effective way to enhance the corrosion resistance of water-based coatings."
