0,Introduction,"The world’s utilization of fossil fuels and petrochemical products is increasing rapidly, whereas the reserved resources for obtaining these products are decreasing [1,2]. Global liquid fuels for transportation are heavily reliant on fossil resources (such as oil, natural gas and coal) [3–7]. The Key World Energy Statistics Report shows that energy demand is expected to increase across many regions [8]. With the depletion of fossil fuel reserves and increase in energy demand, great efforts are being made to convert renewable biomass into valuable fuels and chemicals [9,10]. In recent years, the transformation of biomass as an alternative environmentally friendly, widely abundant and inexpensive renewable resource has attracted attention in both scientific and industrial communities [11–15]. A promising renewable resource for the production of liquid fuels and chemicals is plant biomass, which contains lignocellulose. The constituents of lignocellulosic biomass are lignin (15–20%), cellulose (40–50%), and hemicellulose (25–35%) [16–19]. The hemicellulose component has been converted to C5 industrial sugars that can further be converted into furfural, as has been reported on demonstration scale using the Xylex®Technology [15]. The C5 sugars can readily be dehydrated to furfural (FF) using acid catalysts [11,20–24], of which furfural is a key platform molecule which can be converted to a variety of furan based compounds, alcohols, esters and alkanes [25–27]. Furfuryl alcohol (FA), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), 2-methylfuran (MF), γ-valerolactone (γ-GVL), methyl/ethyl levulinate (EL), 1,5-pentanediol (1,5-PDO) and methyl furan are amongst some of the chemicals derived from furfural Scheme 1 [28,29]. These have significant application as renewable chemicals intermediates, solvents and fuels [30]. The hydrogenation of heterocyclic compounds is one of the most important catalytic transformations and it has a wide range of applications in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries [31,32]. Among these compounds, FA and THFA, which are products of furfural hydrogenation, are particularly attractive. Approximately 62% of the FF produced worldwide is converted into FA [20,33,34], and this is used a polymer monomer, as a solvent, as a constituent in foundry sand binders in the metal casting industry and in the separation of hydrocarbons [35–37]. For example, in the petrochemical industry, paraffinic and naphthenic components can be easily separated from undesired aromatic and olefinic components using furfuryl alcohol [38]. FA is currently manufactured industrially by hydrogenation of FF in a liquid or gas phase over copper chromite catalyst at high temperatures using molecular hydrogen. This industrial process employs an environmentally toxic chromium-based catalyst, therefore there is need to develop new Cr-free catalysts to selectively convert FF to FA [39–41]. Several reports on the hydrogenation of FF to FA over various heterogeneous catalysts mainly Ru, Ir, Pt, Cu and Pd noble metals have been reported in literature [36,42–44]. Sitthisa et al. proposed a catalytic strategy for the hydrogenation of FF using 10 bar of H2 over 5%Pd/SiO2 catalyst. In this report 74% conversion of FF was achieved with 65% yield of FA at 230 °C [45], while O’Driscoll et al. achieved 45% FF conversion and 8% selectivity to FA in ethanol, using 20 bar of H2 at 100 °C [46]. In another report, Thompson et al. reported the hydrogenation of FF to FA over [Pd(NH3)4][ReO4]2 on Al2O3 which exhibited remarkably high activity, resulting in 87% conversion of FF with 73% selectivity to FA using 10 bar H2 at 150 °C [44]. Hronec et al. reported the application of 5% Pt/C as catalyst using 80 bar H2 at 175 °C in just 0.5 h, to give 99% conversion, with 48% selectivity to FA in n-butanol [29]. A look at the effect of solvent and metal (Ni, Pt, Pd, or Ru) on the hydrogenation selectivity, showed that Pt was more selective to produce FA than other metals and n-butanol proved to be the best solvent [29]. Bhogeswararao and co-workers found 95% yield of FA with 96% conversion of FF over Pt/Al2O3 catalyst at 120 °C over 1 h [46,47]. Very few studies have been devoted to the hydrogenation of furfural using homogenous metal complexes. Their high selectivity to the desired product with minimum side products formation often seen with homogenous catalysts, under mild conditions, makes them preferable over heterogeneous catalysts [32]. Platinum Group Metal complexes containing metals such as Rh, Ru and Ir have been reported in literature [32,48–51]. In 1994, Burk et al., reported on a rhodium(I) complex, [Rh(COD)(DiPFc)]+OTf−, which was successfully used to reduce the furfural without catalyst deactivation via decarbonylation and with 100% conversions in less than 3 h under 2–4 bar H2. However, the reaction required the use of degassed methanol since in solution, there was a tendency for the catalyst to react with oxygen, leading to deactivation of the catalyst [50]. Apart from the noble metals that have been used in the conversion of furfural to furfuryl alcohol, Gorgas et al., recently synthesized complexes using earth-abundant iron and used these as catalysts for the hydrogenation of various aldehydes to their respective alcohols, including the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol [52]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no reports on the use of homogenous platinum and palladium catalysts exist in the literature for the hydrogenation of FF to FA, and this sparked our interest to develop and study these systems. This may not only provide mild reaction avenues and chromium-free catalytic systems, but can also allow for probing reaction pathways, so as to understand product and/or by-products formation. Herein, we report on the synthesis, characterization and evaluation of new Pt(II) and Pd(II) complexes as catalyst precursors for the hydrogenation of FF."

The temperature was set and reaction conducted at a stirring speed of 1000 rpm for the required length of time. At the end of the reaction the reactor vessel was cooled, followed by the release of the excess gas.

Elemental analyses were done using a Thermo Scientific Flash 2000 Series CHNS–O Analyser to determine the microanalytical data (C, H and N) of the ligands and catalysts."
12,Results and discussion,
13,Synthesis and characterization of ligands,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization of ligands The ligand L1 was synthesized following previously described literature procedure [55–58]. The Schiff base ligand was prepared by refluxing 4-amino-3-hydroxybenzoic acid with an equimolar amount of 4-formyl-3-hydroxybenzoic acid (Scheme 2 ). Ligand L1 was isolated in good yield (78%) as a red solid. The ligand is soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide, partially soluble in water and insoluble in hexane, toluene, methanol, ethanol and THF. Ligand L2 was synthesized by reducing the imine ligand L1 using sodium borohydride in dry methanol (Scheme 2). The ligand was isolated in good yield (71%) as an orange solid. The ligand is soluble in ethyl acetate, methanol and ethanol, partially soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide and THF and insoluble in hexane, toluene, DCM, chloroform and diethyl ether. The 1H NMR spectrum of the Schiff base ligand L1 shows a signal at 9.09 ppm as a singlet, which is evidence for the formation of the imine functionality. All the aromatic protons for ligand L1 are observed in the region between 7.44 ppm and 7.79 ppm. The carboxylic proton is also observed as a broad singlet at 13.45 ppm. The 1H NMR spectrum of ligand L2 shows the presence of the diagnostic CH2 protons at 4.25 ppm integrating for 2 protons which confirms that the reduction from an imine to amine was successful, while the disappearance of the imine peak at 9.09 ppm is further evidence of a successful reaction. The infrared spectrum of ligand L1 shows an intense stretching vibration characteristic of the imine functionality at 1681 cm−1. The infrared spectrum of ligand L2, shows a broad absorption band corresponding to ѵ(N–H) at 3032 cm−1, while disappearance of the intense stretching vibration of the imine functionality which also confirms that the reduction from the imine to amine was successful. The mass spectrum of ligand L2 shows a peak for m/z = 304.0808 with 100% abundance for [M+H]+."
14,Synthesis and characterization of complexes (C1 – C6),"3.2 Synthesis and characterization of complexes (C1 – C6) The Pd(II) and Pt(II) complexes (C1 –C6) were synthesized by dissolving ligand L1 or L2 in a minimum amount of methanol. Deprotonation of the phenolic proton was performed using an equimolar amount of KOH. The Pd(II)/Pt(II) metal precursors [53,54] were dissolved in DCM and then added to the stirring solutions of ligands L1 or L2 (in methanol) and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24–48 h (Scheme 3 ). All the complexes (C1 – C6) were recovered as yellow, orange or brown solids with yields between (72%–96%) and were all stable at room temperature. The complexes display good water-solubility at room temperature (0.21 mg/mL - 2.9 mg/mL) and are soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide and insoluble in hexane, toluene and diethyl ether. The 1H NMR spectra of the complexes C1– C3 show a signal for the amine proton as a broad singlet at 5.37 ppm, 5.13 ppm and 5.73 ppm, respectively. A splitting of in the CH2 protons adjacent to the phosphorus atom in the region between 2.05 ppm and 2.20 ppm is observed for C1, C2, C4 and C5 (containing propionic acid functionality). This is evidence of coordination either L1 or L2 to the Pd or Pt metal centre since this splitting was not observed in the free metal precursor (Fig. SI 3–8). The 1H NMR spectra of complexes C4 – C6 show a signal for the imine proton as a singlet at 9.00 ppm, 8.99 ppm and 9.06 ppm, respectively. This signal shifted upfield when compared to the free ligand, indicating that imine nitrogen is coordinated to the metal centre. The aromatic protons were identified in the region between 8.12 ppm and 6.32 ppm. The 31P{H} NMR spectra of the two palladium complexes C1 and C3 distinctly show a singlet at 36.39 ppm and 26.14 ppm (Fig. SI 10 and 14). This peak shifted from 16.79 ppm to 23.78 ppm in the metal precursors (Fig. SI 4 and 6), respectively. This is further evidence that the phosphorus atom is coordinated to the palladium centre. The 31P{1H} NMR spectra of the complex C2 and C5 distinctly show a singlet peak at 4.97 ppm and 5.00 ppm with 195Pt satellites at 1 J Pt-P = 3786 Hz (C2) and 1 J Pt-P = 3750 Hz (C5) was observed, respectively (Fig. SI 12 and 18). This is further evidence that only one phosphorus is coordinated to the platinum centre. The 31P{H} NMR spectra of the two palladium complexes C4 and C6 distinctly shows a singlet peak at 36.35 ppm and 21.51 ppm, respectively (Fig. SI 16 and 20). The IR spectra of complexes C1 – C3 were compared with the corresponding free ligand L2. The infrared spectra of the complexes C1, C2 and C3 show the presence of the NH functionality which appears at lower stretching frequencies (3017 cm−1, 3026 cm−1 and 3016 cm−1) when compared to the free ligand. This also further confirms that complexation reactions were successful. The IR spectra of the complexes C4– C6 shows an imine absorption band that had shifted from a higher wavenumber (1681 cm−1) as an intense broad band to lower wavenumber at ѵ(CN str.) 1668 cm−1, 1622 cm−1 and 1679 cm−1. This shift to the lower wavenumber is due to the synergic effect. This also further confirms the coordination of the imine nitrogen to the metal centre [59]. The ESI mass spectra of C1 shows a peak for [M + Na–2H]- at m/z = 686.0765, [M − H]⁻ and further peaks with m/z = 753.1075 (C2), m/z = 662.0447 (C4), m/z = 750.0836 (C5) and m/z = 710.0184 (C6) were observed in their mass spectra. Unfortunately, several attempts to grow crystals suitable for single crystal X-ray diffraction were unsuccessful. Single crystals suitable for single crystal X-ray diffraction where obtained for Pd(II) metal precursor. The structure shows a square planar geometry around the metal centre as expected for Pd(II) complexes. A summary of the bond angles and bond lengths around the metal centre are summarised in the supporting information."
15,Direct hydrogenation of furfural,"3.3 Direct hydrogenation of furfural 3.3.1 Optimization; solvent, temperature, pressure, catalyst loading variation The catalytic activity of the complexes was evaluated in the hydrogenation of furfural using molecular hydrogen. During the catalysis, we observed formation of the furfuryl alcohol (FA) and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) as a secondary product. However, no other products were formed such as ethers, diol, alkanes etc. Catalytic studies to obtain optimum conditions for hydrogenation of furfural were performed with complex C1 as a representative of the series. Firstly, the effect of the solvent on the reaction was investigated (Fig. 1 ). From this study it was observed that furfural conversion and selectivity towards FA was higher in ethanol compared to the other solvents, this might have been due to solubility issues of the complex in other solvents tested. Hydrogen pressure, catalyst loading, reaction time and temperature of the reaction system were investigated. Optimization of pressure was performed at a fixed temperature of 140 °C and 24 h, with various pressure. The best hydrogenation activity of FF to FA was observed at 20 bar with THFA as a second product (13%). At this pressure, the catalyst also displays 100% conversion with a good selectivity towards FA. When the pressure was greater than 20 bar, selectivity towards FA remains constant (Fig. SI 23). Temperature changes show that an increase in temperature can accelerate the reaction. At 140 °C, the C1 shows complete conversion of FF with a good selectivity of 88% FA (Fig. SI 24). Therefore, 140 °C was selected as the best temperature for further experiments. The conversion and selectivity towards FA decreases at a lower temperature (110 °C and 120 °C), which indicated that the reaction was incomplete. At shorter reaction time (2 – 8 h) the reaction shows incomplete conversion of FF. At 10 h, C1 displays 100% conversion of FF, therefore further experiments were performed for 10 h. After 10 h, the selectivity towards FA did not increase (Fig. SI 25). The highest turnover frequency obtained was 175 h−1 after the first 2 h (Fig. SI 26). The reaction was performed using various catalyst loading (0.05 mol% - 0.2 mol%) under the established optimum conditions (Fig. SI 27). At 0.2 mol% catalyst loading, the pre-catalyst C1 displays complete conversion of FF with good selectivity towards FA (88%) and THFA (12%). This is expected since there is more catalyst per unit volume in solution to effect the reaction. It was observed that decrease in catalyst loading (0.05 mol% - 0.15 mol%) resulted in decrease in FF conversion. 3.3.2 Catalyst screening; Pd and Pt metal centres (C1–C6) The reactions were performed with the complexes (C1–C6) as catalysts precursors using molecular hydrogen (Scheme 3) under the established optimum conditions and all the systems proved to be active (Fig. SI 28). The presence of a different metal centres (Pd or Pt) has an influence on the catalyst activity as reflected by the selectivity of catalyst precursors C1 and C2. Pre-catalyst C1 displays excellent conversion (100%) with FA (88%) and THFA (12%) as hydrogenation products (Fig. SI 28). In the case of C2, which contained a Pt metal centre, conversion of 83% was observed with 100% selectivity towards FA. Similarly, C5 with a Pt centre also shows 100% selectivity to FA. The presence of a bulky benzyl group in C3 resulted in a lower conversion of 70% at 20 bar as compared to C1 with an alkyl group, where 100% conversion is observed. This may be due to the rigidity of the bulky benzyl group which, may hinder the incoming substrate from interacting with the Pd metal centre more effectively. Catalysts C1 and C4 with an alkyl chain resulted in excellent conversion, this may be due to the flexibility of the alkyl chain which allows for interaction between the substrate and metal centre. 3.3.3 Homogeneity studies The mercury poisoning experiment is important in differentiating between a heterogeneous and homogenous transition catalysed reactions [60]. This test rules out the formation of any catalytically active Pd(0) and Pt(0) nanoparticles. The results obtained showed slight drop in conversions in the presence of Hg when pre-catalysts C2 and C3 were employed (Fig. SI 29). This may suggest slight activity due to Pd(0) and Pt(0) but however the system is mostly homogenous. The reaction was promoted by entirely homogenous catalytic systems C1, C4, C5 and C6, because there was no change in the conversion and activity when these pre-catalysts were employed in the presence of mercury. 3.3.4 Recyclability studies Recyclability tests were performed using pre-catalyst C1. Upon completion of the reaction the crude mixture was extracted with chloroform. The aqueous layer containing the catalyst was dried under vacuum at 115 °C and leaving behind the catalyst. The catalyst was carefully washed and the transferred back into the reactor vessel using 5 mL of ethanol, followed by drying in an oven at 45 °C. After the solvent was completely evaporated, the reactor vessel was recharged with FF (10 mmol) and ethanol (10 mL). The reaction mixture was heated at 140 °C for 10 h. The catalyst displayed excellent recyclability (Fig. 2 ). The pre-catalyst C1 could be recycled efficiently twice. A significant drop in conversion of FF was seen in the 4th cycle. A possible reason for this observation could be due to partial decomposition of the active species during the reaction or leaching of the active catalyst during extraction [59,61]."
16,Transfer hydrogenation of furfural using C1 and C5,"3.4 Transfer hydrogenation of furfural using C1 and C5 Different bases, catalyst loading, reaction time and temperature of the reaction system were investigated. Based on the previous experimental results obtained in the direct hydrogenation of furfural, the best Pd-based catalyst (C1) and the best Pt-based catalyst (C5) were selected and hence used for further test in transfer hydrogenation using formic acid as a hydrogen source (Table 1 ). We observed formation of the furfuryl alcohol (FA) only using formic acid as a hydrogen source. Initially, the transfer hydrogenation reactions were carried out in the absence of a base and C5 gave very poor conversion of FF (38%) while C1 did not convert furfural to any product (Entries 1 and 2). An increase in conversion was observed in the presence of triethylamine as a base (Entries 3 and 4). This shows that the reaction requires a base for the decomposition of formic acid. An equimolar amount of base was therefore employed for the subsequent reactions. Pre-catalyst C5 gave complete conversion compared to pre-catalyst C1 when the amount of formic acid was increased (Entries 5 and 6). Conditions: Substrate (FF, 10 mmol), catalyst precursor 0.02 mmol (0.2 mol%), Et3N (equiv as indicated), formic acid (equiv as indicated) and time (10 h), 140 °C. Average error estimates: ± 0.32 (1), ±0.40 (2), ±0.44 (3), ±0.49 (4), ±0.46 (5), ±0.48 (6), ±0.54 (7), ±0.50 (8), ±0.57 (9), ±0.51 (10), ±0.25 (11), ±0.23 (12). b Determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy (isolated yield). Conv. = conversion, Sel. = selectivity and Cat. = catalyst. Both the pre-catalysts are selective towards FA only. Two equimolar amounts of formic acid were selected for the hydrogenation reaction and this was used for all subsequent reactions. Complete conversion of FF and 100% selectivity towards FA was observed in the absence of ethanol for both pre-catalysts thus for all subsequent reactions ethanol was unnecessary (Entries 7 and 8). This showed that the highest conversion of FF can be achieved using 20 mmol of formic acid in the absence of solvent for both pre-catalysts C1 and C5 (Entries 7 and 8). This is an advantage because it makes the process more economical, and most importantly, safer, since the reaction performs well without molecular hydrogen. Optimization of the bases was performed using 1 equivalent of each of the bases at 140 °C. KOH afforded the poorest conversion (Fig. SI 30). The results showed that both the pre-catalysts performed better with organic bases (Et3N and pyridine) than with inorganic bases, possibly due to poor solubility of the KOH in the absence of solvent. Both the pre-catalysts gave complete conversion when Et3N was used. The catalyst loading variation was performed at a fixed temperature of 140 °C for 10 h (Fig. SI 31). It was observed that a decrease of catalyst loading (0.03 mol%) resulted in decrease in conversion of FF. An increase in the catalyst used during the hydrogenation reaction resulted in an increase in the conversion of FF. At catalyst loading greater than 0.05 mol%, both pre-catalysts still maintained complete conversion of FF. Temperature changes show that an increase of temperature accelerates the reaction when both pre-catalysts (C1 and C5) are employed, while maintaining 100% selectivity to FA (Fig. SI 32). At 120 °C, both the pre-catalysts gave moderate conversion of 71% (C1) and 79% (C5). At 140 °C, both pre-catalysts displayed complete conversion of FF with a good selectivity. Therefore, 140 °C was selected as the best temperature for further experiments. At shorter reaction time (2–6 h) the reaction shows incomplete conversion of FF (Fig. SI 33). At 8 h, the pre-catalyst C5 displays 100% conversion of FF and 95% conversion of FF with pre-catalyst C1. This shows that C5 performed better compared to C1 in transfer hydrogenation reaction. Thus 8 h was selected as the best time for the transfer hydrogenation reaction. At 10 h, the conversion of FF still remained 100% using pre-catalyst C5. Pt(II) catalyst C5 shows better catalytic activity with a highest turnover frequency (Table SI 1) of ca.1060 h−1 in the first hour. 3.4.1 Homogeneity test In order to establish the nature of the active species responsible for the catalysis a mercury poisoning experiment was also conducted. The reactions were performed using both catalytic systems and one equivalent of mercury. This proved that the reactions were promoted by molecular catalysts, because separate reactions with C1 and C5, in the presence of metallic mercury, exhibited no significant change in the conversions (Fig. SI 34). 3.4.2 Recyclability studies Recyclability test was performed using pre-catalyst C5 where formic was a hydrogen source (Fig. SI 35). It is important to note that the selectivity to furfuryl alcohol remained 100% until the fifth cycle. The pre-catalyst displayed excellent recyclability. The pre-catalyst C5 could be recycled efficiently twice with conversion of 100% in the 1st and 2nd cycle. FF conversion was reduced to 91%, 83% and 67% in the 3rd, 4th and 5th cycles, respectively. This observation could be due to the partial decomposition of the active species with each cycle."
17,In situ NMR studies of the catalytic process,"3.5 In situ NMR studies of the catalytic process Pre-catalyst C5, Et3N and formic acid were loaded into the J Young NMR tube and heated in an oil bath at 80 °C [62,63]. Transformation of the pre-catalyst into an active species was monitored using 1H NMR and 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy. After 30 min, the formation of H2 gas as a result of the decomposition of formic acid, was observed in the 1H NMR spectrum. The chemical shift of the H2 appears as a singlet at 4.38 ppm (Fig. SI 36). Similar results have been reported in literature [62,64]. During the course of the decomposition of the formic acid, there was a cleavage of the Pt-imine nitrogen bond with subsequent hydrolysis of the functional group. The hydrolysis of the imine functional group was evidenced by the appearance of the proton signal at around 10.32 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. SI 36). The Pt-imine nitrogen bond cleavage results in a vacant coordination site which allows the formate ion to coordinate to the metal for the decomposition to take place. This is supported by empirical evidence in our NMR studies. The role of base was to deprotonate the formic acid to the formate, which then coordinates to the Pt metal centre, followed by its decomposition to H2 and CO2 [62]. Formation of the hydrido species of C5 was observed within 30 min (Fig. 3 ), thus leading to the reaction mechanism proposed in Scheme 4 . The 1H NMR spectrum shows a triplet peak at −16.79 ppm, with a 1 J P-H coupling constant of 20 Hz. This signal has two 195Pt satellites flanking it due to 1H–195Pt with a 1 J Pt-H coupling of 1232 Hz. Similar results have been observed in literature [65,66]. The 31P{1H} NMR spectra shows a change in chemical shift from 4.90 ppm (exhibits 31P–195Pt coupling of 3786 Hz) to 22.55 ppm (Fig. 4 ), which has been assigned to the hydrido species C5-III shown in Scheme 4. After 120 min of heating, the signal at 22.55 ppm (exhibits 31P–195Pt coupling of 2385 Hz) was the only dominant peak observed. In order to monitor the reaction progress another small scale reaction was performed in the presence of the substrate, furfural (FF), by loading FF, the pre-catalyst C5, Et3N and formic acid into a J Young NMR tube and heating the contents of the tube in an oil bath at 80 °C. Again, the 1H NMR spectrum shows the appearance of new singlet peak at 4.37 ppm, corresponding to formation of the H2 gas (Fig. SI 37). The same peak pattern that indicates the cleavage of the Pt-imine nitrogen bond was also observed. A reaction was also performed in the presence of deuterated formic acid, FF, pre-catalyst C5 and Et3N in a J Young NMR tube and heated in an oil bath at 80 °C. The same peak pattern that indicates the cleavage of the Pt-imine nitrogen bond was also observed. The 1H NMR spectrum shows a signal as a triplet peak at −16.67 ppm, with platinum satellites with a coupling constant of 16 Hz (Fig. SI 38). The spectrum indicates that the formation of D2 comes from the decomposition of deuterated formic acid (deuterium carrier) followed by formation of the Pt-D deuteride species."
18,Proposed mechanism for the hydrogenation reaction,"3.6 Proposed mechanism for the hydrogenation reaction Based on the in situ 1H NMR and 31P{1H} NMR results, we propose the hydrogenation reaction takes place via a mechanism involving molecular hydrogen that is generated by decomposing formic acid to CO2 and H2 (Scheme 4). The first step involves formation of formate ion deprotonation of formic acid by Et3N. The formate ion then coordinates to the metal centre after the Pt-imine nitrogen bond has cleaved. Molecular hydrogen then coordinates to the metal centre and forms a Pt–H2 complex. This leads to the formation of (C5-II) by weak interaction of molecular hydrogen with the metal centre. As a result of its weak interaction to the metal centre the molecular hydrogen can easily dissociate from the metal centre, leading to the elongation of the H–H bond (heterolytic cleavage) [67]. The Pt–H2 species is an unstable intermediate which results in the formation of the stable Pt-mono-hydride active species (as observed in the NMR spectroscopy experiments) (C5-III). After formation of the active species, it is proposed that the reaction proceeds via reported literature methods for the hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds [62]. The hydride from the active species is transferred to the carbonyl carbon when the substrate coordinates to the Pt(II) centre through the carbonyl oxygen (C5-IV). A step following formation of (C5-III) could be the formation of four-membered ring intermediate or transition state (C5-IV) between C–H and Pt–O of (C5-III). The hydride transfer creates a vacant site for another H2 to coordinate (C5–V) and transfer second hydrogen which is then transferred to the carbonyl oxygen (C5-VI). This results in formation of FA with regeneration of the active species (C5-III) to repeat the cycle."
19,Conclusions,"In summary, new six Pd(II) and Pt(II) complexes have been synthesized and characterized using various spectroscopic and analytical techniques. The complexes were evaluated as catalyst precursors for the hydrogenation of furfural in ethanol. These catalysts showed excellent selectivity towards formation of furfuryl alcohol. Pre-catalyst C1, C3, C4 and C6 also formed a second product (tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol). Recyclability experiments were performed using pre-catalyst C1 and the results show good recyclability. Mercury poisoning tests showed pre-catalysts C2 and C3 exhibited slight drop in activity due to active nanoparticles, suggesting that the catalytic reaction was mostly homogenous. The reaction was entirely homogenous when pre-catalysts C1, C4, C5 and C6 were employed. Complexes C1 and C5 showed greater activity and selectivity as catalyst precursors for the hydrogenation of furfural using formic acid as a hydrogen source. The highest turnover frequency was 1060 h−1 using pre-catalyst C5 for the transfer hydrogenation of FF, showing good selective towards furfuryl alcohol. Both catalytic systems were found to be entirely homogenous in hydrogenation of furfural using formic acid as a hydrogen source. From the in situ NMR studies we have proposed a reaction pathway for the formation of furfuryl alcohol and identified the catalytically active species."
