0,Introduction,"Healthy human blood contains small amounts of metabolic methanol, and its blood levels are 400–1,000 times less than its toxic concentration [1]. Physiologic levels of methanol in the human body have been attributed to diverse exogenous and endogenous sources. Fruits and vegetables are the primary sources of methanol in the human body, mainly due to the hydrolysis of pectin by intestinal flora [2]. In healthy individuals, methanol, regardless of its source, is kept at physiological levels by several mechanisms, the major one being its enzymatic oxidation to formaldehyde by ADH and then to formic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase. These toxic compounds are then eliminated in the urine or further metabolized to carbon dioxide [3,4]. Increasing concentrations of methanol initially have a narcotic effect [3]. However, as concentrations increase, toxic effects commonly referred to as “methanol poisoning” result from the accumulation of formaldehyde and formic acid [5]. In this research, we report for the first time an 11.58-year-old boy with persistently high blood methanol who presented with sleepiness, imbalance, nausea, speech problems and fluctuation of consciousness and his brother (the first child of the family) passed away without diagnosis."
1,Case presentation and test methods:,
2,Case report,"2.1 Case report A 4.3-year-old boy (AAK) was brought to the hospital by his parents because of occasional sleepiness, imbalance, vertigo, one convulsion and periodic severe diarrhea and vomiting since 2 years of age. He also had the history of hypoglycemia with plasma glucose levels of 0.61, 1.22 and 1.11 mmol/L. On past history, at 2 years of age his mother noticed imbalance and vertigo on their way from the daycare center and suspected he had been given sleep-promoting medication. At that time, the sole abnormal finding in the work-up was hypoglycemic episodes for which he was started on corn starch and became symptom-free after a 3-week course of treatment. Family history: He was the second child of healthy parents in a first cousin consanguineous marriage. The first child of the family (A.K.) was a boy who had a history of recurrent fever, convulsions, vomiting with frequent admissions to different hospitals since he was one year old. In his medical reports, neurodevelopmental delay, microcephaly, and hypoglycemia were recorded. At 2 years of age, he had 2-day unconsciousness following a seizure triggered by fever interpreted as a long post-ictal phase. At that time, the bilateral abnormal hippocampus was recorded on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). He had experienced several further episodes of seizures and loss of consciousness and in between, suffered from vomiting. His metabolic workup did not reveal anything. He passed away at 4.5 years of age. Physical examination of our patient (AAK) showed no organomegaly or other abnormal physical finding. He did not have any developmental delays. At age 7, when he was symptomatic, laboratory testing revealed plasma ammonia level, 34 µmol/L (normal range, 25–50) [55 µg/dL (40–85)], Plasma lactate and pyruvate were frequently measured and found to be at normal range except once with lactate: 7.1 mmol/L (normal range, 0.5–2.2) [64 mg/dL (4.5–20)] pyruvate: 0.148 mmol/L (0.034–0.1) [1.3 mg/dL (0.3–0.9)] and lactate/pyruvate ratio: 49 and at that time arterial blood gas showed acidosis with pH of 7.24 and anion gap 18. Workups for inborn errors of metabolism as acylcarnitine profile (C0–C18.2) by tandem mass spectrometry [MS/MS], urine organic acid by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry [GC/MS]) were found to be within normal limits. Measurements of glucose concomitantly with insulin and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were normal. Laboratory testing showed no abnormalities for the following battery of tests; complete blood count (CBC), serum levels of urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphate, chloride, as well as, serum cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, AST, ALT, LDH, CPK, aldolase, thyroid function tests, blood gasses, anion gap, plasma ammonia, and amino acid levels by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), as well as urine amino acids and carbohydrates by thin layer chromatography (TLC), and urine Succinylacetone. Corn starch and then diazoxide were prescribed to prevent hypoglycemia but were given only periodically by the parents. He was lost from follow-up for approximately 5 years during which time he had discontinued his medications. He referred again when he was 11.5 years old, because of polydipsia, polyuria, and weight loss. His neurodevelopment was normal and his mother did not report any developmental issues since birth. He was reported to have been symptom-free until his admission to a local hospital due to a blood sugar level >16.7 mmol/L, following which he was referred to our hospital. After admission, the work-up including glucose tolerance test with measurement of glucose and insulin in 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after a 70 g glucose load, revealed elevated glucose and insulin levels, and HOMA-IR was 18 (normal <2.6) (Table 1 ). With the diagnosis of type-2 diabetes mellitus, repaglinide (meglitinide) (Novo Nordisk) was started for him. After a week, blood glucose was controlled and he was discharged from the hospital. According to his mother's report, repaglinide was administered only for 4 days at home and was discontinued because blood sugar became normal before and after meals. Nevertheless, he became sleepy three days later and was admitted in our hospital. At entry, his blood sugar was normal but he had sleepiness, imbalance, nausea, and speech problems. His consciousness fluctuated during hospitalization. He had imbalance, ataxia, and dysarthria but was verbose and euphoric, with abnormal speech and behavior while awake, and he was responsive to mild painful stimulus but not vocal stimuli while asleep. The vital signs stayed stable during sleep periods. He had long sleep times with intermittent short durations of being awake for eating, in which time he still showed abnormal behavior and imbalance. Wake periods shrank gradually and he began to sleep for four consecutive days, during which he was unresponsive to painful stimuli as well; therefore, he was transferred to the intensive care unit. According to family history and clinical findings, the probability of a hereditary metabolic disorder was considered. However, none of the diagnostic steps for inborn errors of metabolism were fruitful. All treatment protocols of respiratory chain defects was carried out with no response. Brain computerized tomography (CT-scan), MRI, Electrocardiogram and echocardiography were normal. Ophthalmic examination with slit lamp and examination of the retina did not reveal any disorder. Postulating the accumulation of an unknown toxic compound, the patient was hemodialyzed, which resulted in the patient regaining consciousness. This response confirmed the presence of a dialyzable toxic compound. A Shaldon hemodialysis catheter was placed in the internal jugular vein and the patient was dialyzed twice weekly. As he improved with dialysis, a toxicological examination was performed on his blood specimen in a specialized toxicological laboratory immediately before the next dialysis. Lab results revealed a serum methanol level 3.8 mmol/L (12.2 mg/dL) 4 times the upper acceptable level, 0.06–0.93 mmol/L (0.2–3 mg/dL), while both ethanol and formaldehyde levels in serum were undetectable. All other toxicological tests were negative. His parents were questioned and denied giving him anything containing methanol. The patient was under constant supervision while in the hospital and at home. Retrospectively, we realized that the previous behaviors of the child resembled intoxicated people in his talking and walking. At the time of hospitalization, there was not any significant odor of alcohol from the patient to lead us to the possibility of alcohol intoxication, which is plausible because the ratio of breath to blood alcohol is generally very low [6], and recognizing alcohol ingestion is inaccurate from the smell of the breath [7], especially in our case that the source of alcohol was endogenous. Coincidentally, the patient caught fever and began to have chills, and investigation showed pseudomonas infection in the dialysis catheter site; thus, the catheter had to be removed and broad-spectrum antibiotics were started. With the start of antibiotic treatment, the patient’s symptoms were relieved and his serum methanol level dropped to 1.21 mmol/L. This led us to hypothesize that bacterial flora in the colon might be the source of the high level of methanol by biochemical reactions on pectin in fruits and vegetables, and that we might achieve therapeutic results by eliminating those bacteria. To test this hypothesis, metronidazole and a laxative were added to the regimen to attenuate intestinal anaerobes, following which patient’s symptoms began to fade. Eventually, the patient was discharged on a prescription of metronidazole tablets, laxative syrup, and probiotic capsules. One week later, the patient returned with his old clinical presentations including sleepiness, imbalance, and speech abnormality. He was hospitalized and broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated again, but his condition gradually worsened and no improvement was seen even after switching to more potent antibiotics. At that time, methanol levels increased parallel to patient’s clinical symptoms, from 2.24 mmol/L (7.2 mg/dL) to 2.58 mmol/L (8.3 mg/dL) (Fig. 1 ). His consciousness deteriorated and mandated reinstallation of the dialysis catheter, and hemodialysis was restarted. His ophthalmologic examination did not show any disorder. Liver size and hepatic enzymes were all normal despite high methanol levels. Formaldehyde could not be detected in the patient’s blood. We therefore assumed there might be a deficiency or abnormality of ADH in this patient, resulting in his inability to metabolize some or all of the endogenous methanol to formaldehyde. We decided to give an enzyme inducer to activate the degradation of methanol. To do so, we started phenobarbital as a relatively safe hepatic enzyme inducer which could increase the total amount of cytochrome P450 [8] and induce CYP2E1 [9]. He became better but still needed hemodialysis. Since zinc is in the structural component of alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme as well as its cofactor, zinc supplementation was started for the patient. Surprisingly, his alertness was regained, and sleepiness, imbalance, and abnormal speech were resolved. The euphoric state also began to normalize. Meanwhile, the patient developed anorexia, diaphoresis, headache, irritability, hand tremor, and insomnia conforming to withdrawal or hangover syndrome, further confirming the diagnosis. Methanol levels were checked serially and showed a decline to normal levels. Two weeks after the initiation of the mentioned treatment, patient’s withdrawal symptoms resolved remarkably so that we could take out the Shaldon dialysis catheter from his vein and discontinue hemodialysis. He was well for nine months without dialysis, but he discontinued zinc without our permission for one week, and reverted to sleepiness and intoxicated behavior; his serum methanol increased to 3.71 mmol/L (11.9 mg/dL). After restarting zinc (10 mg bid), he visibly became well and his methanol level decreased to 0.03 mmol/L (0.1 mg/dL). Zinc supplementation was continued with a dose of 15 mg/day. Probiotics and laxatives were discontinued gradually. Currently, his consciousness and behavior are normal he has started school again and does not require hemodialysis. Once again, signs and symptoms recurred after another discontinuation of zinc, but improved after restarting it. He has had normal conditions for 6.3 years, currently at the age 17.8 and a height of 175 cm. He is currently doing well in high school and is in satisfactory health without any of the previous signs or symptoms of methanol intoxication. The concentrations of methanol during the course of the disease and while the patient was on different treatments are presented in Fig. 1."
3,Test methods:,"2.2 Test methods: Blood levels of methanol were measured by spectrophotometry (Milton Roy, US Colorimetry), based on a colorimetric method [8], with some modification. Briefly, 0.2 mL serum sample was first deproteinated by mixing with 1.8 mL trichloroacetic acid. The sample was then combined with 0.1 mL KMnO4 solution (5 g in 100 mL H2O) and 1 mL H2SO4 (10%) followed by the addition of enough powdered sodium bisulfite to decolorize the permanganate. Subsequently, 0.2 mL of freshly prepared chromotropic acid solution (0.5 g in 100 mL H2O) and 0.6 mL of concentrated H2SO4 were added. The mixture was heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min, which gave rise to a red-violet color indicating the presence of methanol. Quantitation was performed by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm. We calculated methanol concentration (mg/dL) by the formula (absorbance-160) × 8/670, with the conversion unit of 0.312 for mmol/L. Limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) were determined to be at 0.1 mg/dL (0.0312 mmol/L) and 0.3 mg/dL (0.9 mmol/L), respectively. A calibration curve was prepared by serial dilutions of 100 mg/dL solution of standard of methanol (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), for the determination of LOD and LOQ. Inter-assay and intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) were checked and were less than 10% and 8%, respectively. The interference of ethanol and formaldehyde was ruled out by measuring each substance separately, as described below. Ethanol was measured by an enzymatic method by ADH, using Ethanol Gen 2 kit (Roche Diagnostics) with Cobas Integra 400 instrument, based on the photometric detection of the rate of NADH production during enzymatic action of ADH on ethanol. The lower limit of detection for this kit was 2.17 mmol/L, and the intra- and inter-assay coefficient of variation was less than 2% and 4%, respectively. Formic acid was measured by a colorimetric method [10] with some modifications, using the deproteinated plasma that was prepared as described above. For this purpose, 0.1 mL of the sample was added to a test tube containing 100 mg magnesium, followed by the addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 10 separate portions at less than one-minute intervals, and then immersed in an ice bath. Subsequently, 0.3 mL chromotropic acid was added and vortexed for 5 s. The mixture was heated in a boiling water bath for 30 min. After centrifugation and separation of the white precipitate, the absorbance of the colored supernatant was read at 570 nm and the concentration was determined using a calibration curve generated from 0 to 15 μg analytical standard grade formic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) in hydrochloric acid solution. Through this method, as low as 0.5 μg/mL formic acid is detected [10]. Formaldehyde measurement was performed by the method of Bricker and Johnson [11]. For this purpose, 0.5 mL chromotropic acid and 5 mL concentrated sulfuric acid were poured into a test tube containing 0.5 mL of sample, and mixed with continuous shaking followed by heating for 30 min in a boiling water bath. After cooling, the absorbance was read at 570 nm against a reagent blank. The amount of formaldehyde was estimated using a calibration curve generated using analytical standard grade formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany)."
4,Genetic studies,"2.3 Genetic studies Whole exome sequencing (CentoXome® Gold) was performed at Centogene AG. An Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon V6 kit was used for the enrichment of exons. Genomic DNA was fragmented by sonication, and Illumina adapters were ligated to generate fragments for subsequent sequencing on the HiSeqX platform (Illumina) to yield an average coverage depth of ~30X. An end-to-end in-house bioinformatics pipeline including base calling, primary filtering of low-quality reads and probable artifacts, and annotation of variants were applied. Copy Number Variation (CNV) calling was based on the Centogene pipeline for CNV calling (HAS pipeline). All disease-causing variants considered for this study were in: 1-the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD®), 2- ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) that is a freely available, 3-Public archive of human genetic variants and interpretations of their significance to disease, [maintained at the National Institutes of Health, or in Centogene mutation database (CentoMD®)], 4-All variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) of less than 5% in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). The evaluation was focused on coding exons along with flanking +/−20 intronic bases; however, it was extended to the entire gene region for candidate genes or in search for a second previously described variant in autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance pattern. All pertinent inheritance patterns were taken into account. Besides, family history and clinical information were employed to evaluate eventually identified variants. All identified variants were evaluated with respect to their pathogenicity and causality. Alcohol dehydrogenase-related genes were as follows: ADH1A, ADH1B, ADH1C, ADH4, ADH5, ADH6, ADH7, ADHFE1, ALDH1A1, ALDH2, ALDH8A1, APP, BDH1, CFI, CYP2E1, DHRS2, DHRS4, DHRS9, EMC1, FABP2, GABRA2, HPGD, HSD17B10, HSD17B11, HSD17B8, HSPB3, HSPB6, HTR2A, RDH12, RDH5, RTN4IP1, SORD, TAS2R16, TPI1, ZADH1. A trio whole-exome sequencing (WES) test was initially performed for the patient and his parents. The result provided a missense mutation in ALDH3B2 gene that was classified as an uncertain effect on protein function (class 3P). Thus, whole-genome sequencing was performed for the patient. A clinical-grade analysis by CentoGene, using Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 37 (GRCh37), identified a homozygous mutation in the seventh exon of ALDH3B2 gene Chr11(GRCh37):g.67432789C > G (NM_001031615.1:c.673G > C, Gly225Arg), just as reported by WES. This variant was predicted as deleterious by SIFT, disease-causing by MutationTaster and probably damaging by Polyphen (prediction software tool), but not observed in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), 1000-genome project. It had an allele frequency of 0.000026 in CentoMD (the private database of CentoGene). It was, however, rejected as the cause of the disease because no known function has been reported for ALDH3B2. As a result, we re-analyzed the RAW data of whole-genome sequencing of the patient. For this purpose, we used a custom workflow for variation calling, annotation and prioritization, based on the newer GRCh38 reference genome assembly. Compared to GRCh37 that were first used for the analysis of data, GRCh38 reference provides more complete human reference genome information, produces less false positive structural variants, and yields more accurate and reliable genomic analysis results [12]. The updates included in GRCh38 render the reference a better annotation substrate and influence variant interpretation at clinically relevant loci [13]. Based on the GRCh38, analysis of genetic test results showed mutation in the ADH1C gene. Whole-genome sequencing revealed a homozygous mutation in ADH1C gene located at exon 3, namely, a single-base substitution (hg38:4–99347033-C-A) leading to a premature termination codon (NM_000669.5:c.232G > T; p.Gly78Ter). Both parents were heterozygous in WES data and Sanger sequencing. This variant had low frequency (less than 5%) in all population databases, including the genome aggregation database (gnomAD), exome aggregation consortium (ExAC), 1000 G, and exome sequencing project. Unfortunately, this locus in the hg19 genome assembly was sequenced as Adenine nucleotide. Therefore, some computational prediction software tools classified changing variant adenine to cytosine (A > C) as benign. Because the variant (C > A) is a nonsense variant in exon 3 and this gene has 9 exons, nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) occurs and acts as a null variant (PVS1 score in ACMG classification). In addition, the clinical (PP4) and paraclinical (PS3) findings were compatible with abnormal methanol metabolism."
5,Discussion,"Methanol is a clear, colorless liquid that has an alcoholic odor. Normal level of methanol in the blood is estimated to range from 0.20 ± 0.035 to 5.37 ± 0.08 mg/L (0.0067 ± 0.0012 to 0.1790 ± 0.0027 .mmol/L) [3] “in healthy humans”. The methanol is derived from normal metabolic processes as well as from dietary sources such as fruit, fruit juices, vegetables and alcoholic beverages [14]. In bacteria, there are two classes of reactions that result in methanol production: methyl ester hydrolysis and redox reactions. Pectin esterase and methane monooxygenases are among the bacterial enzymes responsible for methanol production [15]. Protein-glutamate methylesterase (PGM) is another common methanol producing enzyme, which is found in Escherichia coli and hydrolyzes methyl esters of glutamate [16]. Apart from the exogenous sources of methanol, physiologic processes that involve S-adenosyl methionine, like those catalyzed by methyltransferases, also contribute to physiological methanol production [17]. The high levels of methanol in this patient were not likely a result of methanol ingestion because he was supervised at all times while in the hospital. Thus, accumulation of endogenous methanol due to a defect in its metabolism was suspected. There are three different enzymes that the body uses to metabolize methanol: Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), cytochrome P450 monooxygenases as the microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system (MEOS), and catalase. All of these enzymes work by taking off two hydrogen atoms from the alcohol molecule. MEOS and catalase are minor pathways of alcohol metabolism in the body, whereas ADH accounts for up to 90% of alcohol metabolism [4]. Methanol itself has relatively low toxicity although high blood levels of methanol will cause symptoms typical of alcohol intoxication. Toxicity is the result of the metabolism of methanol to its severely toxic metabolites, formaldehyde and formic acid [18]. Main symptoms of toxicity include abdominal pain, metabolic acidosis, liver failure, and visual disturbances, including decreased visual acuity, photophobia, blurred vision and blindness. Neurologic abnormalities including confusion, stupor, and coma are often present. Formaldehyde is rapidly metabolized to formic acid causing visual and more severely neurologic abnormalities [5,19]. The symptoms of this patient and his clinical examination provided no indication of formic acid toxicity. Our patient did not have any issues with his vision, and his eyes were examined by an ophthalmologist and found to be normal. There was no residual neurological deficit after each attack. His liver function tests were normal despite the high levels of methanol. This patient never experienced flushing or acidotic state. Formaldehyde levels in blood were undetectable despite the elevated methanol levels, leading to the hypothesis of a defect in methanol metabolism at the ADH level (Fig. 2 ). The clinical manifestations of our patient show the effects of methanol accumulation by itself like accumulation of precursors in other enzyme deficiencies in hereditary metabolic disorders [20]. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) is an NAD+(Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide)-dependent enzyme. It is the main enzyme responsible for the metabolism of ethanol, methanol, and many other alcohols that enter the human body [21]. Alcohol dehydrogenase is expressed primarily in the stomach and the liver [22]. Sarkola et al. have shown that inhibition of ADH by 4-methylpyrazole leads to a linear increase in methanol and ethanol concentration over time, indicating that methanol is endogenously produced and establishes a connection between the low activity of ADH and methanol accumulation [23]. However, in our case no ethanol was detected which could be due to the presence of various isoenzymes of ADH. There are seven ADH's isoenzymes in humans, all of which generate the same chemical reaction with different affinities towards various alcohols [24,25]. The catalytic efficiency of most isoenzymes is high for ethanol, whereas for methanol it is low for most isoenzymes [24]. While all the isoenzymes of ADH family oxidize ethanol, neither class II nor class III isoenzymes of ADH oxidize methanol. The results of our genetic study indicated a mutation in ADH1C gene, confirming the clinical and laboratory findings which indicated insufficient ADH1 activity. Normal ethanol levels, despite high methanol concentrations, can be attributed to the efficacy of other ADH isoenzymes in metabolizing ethanol. Class I ADH is composed of three subunits, including α, β, and γ [25], and the genetic mutation reported above has occurred in the amino acid number 78 of the γ subunit, coded ADH1C. ADH genes are classified as ADH1 (coding for class I isoenzymes), ADH2 (coding for class II isoenzymes), and so on for the other known classes in mammalian systems. There are several class I genes in the human population including ADH1A, ADH1B*1, ADH1B*2, ADH1B*3, ADH1C*1, and ADH1C*2. The protein products of these genes are comprised of the subunits of ADH and are named as α, β1, β2, β3, γ1, and γ2, respectively. They can randomly join to yield both homo- and heterodimeric forms [26], including αγ2, γ2γ2, αγ1, αβ1, β1γ2, γ1γ1, β1γ1 and β1β1 [27]. The γ subunit participates in the composition of several isoenzymes and thus, mutation in γ subunit is expected to affect all of these isoenzymes which are responsible for methanol detoxification. On the other hand, γ subunit is expressed in stomach [28]. Taking into account the GUT microbiota as the putative source of methanol production [3], this subunit might be considered a first-line defence against endogenous methanol, further confirming the effect of this mutation on methanol metabolism. Each molecule of ADH contains four zinc atoms. Two of these zinc atoms are involved in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. They are anchored in the bottom of the cleft of the active site by three protein side chains. Inhibition of catalytic zinc leads to enzyme inhibition, as is the case of 1,10-phenanthroline. This molecule binds zinc atoms and is a competitive inhibitor of both coenzyme and substrate binding. The other two zinc atoms are necessary for the structural stability of the molecule and might be required to maintain proper conformation of the subunit [29]. Amelioration of the patient's symptoms following zinc administration further confirms the suggested partial defect in methanol metabolism by ADH1C in this patient. Provocation and stabilization of residual enzyme activity using cofactors or vitamins is a common treatment option for inborn errors of metabolism that occur due to a defect in a metabolic enzyme [30]. About one-third of mutations in the enzyme-coding genes leads to lower binding affinity for the enzyme cofactor, resulting in a reduced rate of reaction. Thus, many human genetic metabolic disorders can be treated or ameliorated by administering high doses of the cofactor, which at least partly restores enzymatic activity [31]. Zinc has been shown to be a suitable option for treating acrodermatitis enteropathica [32], and copper has been suggested for the treatment of cytochrome c oxidase deficiency [33]. Treatment by cofactor supplementation has also been successful in patients with some other forms of inborn errors, e.g., B12 supplementation in some cases of methylmalonic acidemia, B6 in some cases of homocystinuria, riboflavin for glutaric aciduria type 2, and thiamine in maple syrup urine disease [34,35]. In line with our findings, dietary supplementation with zinc has been previously shown to increase ADH activity in the liver of alcohol-fed mice [36]. If the observed mutation causes the reduced binding of ADH1C to its cofactor, then it is reasonable that zinc supplementation leads to the amelioration of the clinical symptoms. Another plausible mechanism of the higher activity of ADH1C by zinc might be the elevated half-life and activity of the remaining α and β subunits. Consistently, increased half-life of proteins by zinc has been previously reported [37]. According to the case record, the patient in this study had been symptom-free during infancy. Generally, children under 5 years of age have reduced ADH activity and ADH activity in infants is only about 50% of that seen in adults. [38]. However, infants are able to efficiently eliminate methanol, possibly via catalase [38]. Catalase is a peroxisomal enzyme that is found in most, if not all the cells of human body and converts alcohols into aldehydes with simultaneous reduction of hydrogen peroxide molecules [39]. The catalase pathway accounts for about 2% of ethanol metabolism [4]. Part of methanol metabolism is catalyzed by the microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system (MEOS) which is a cytochrome P450-dependent system including cytochromes P4502E1 (CYP2E1), P4501A2 (CYP1A2), and P4503A4 (CYP3A4) [40]. CYP2E1 is the main member of this system. It is active in the liver and like alcohol dehydrogenase, it converts ethanol and methanol to acetaldehyde and formaldehyde respectively [41]. Due to the role of this enzyme system in methanol metabolism, phenobarbital was administered to the patient as a potential means of inducing its activity. Nonetheless, it could not alleviate the symptoms completely which may be the result of the minor role of this enzymatic system in methanol metabolism. MEOS accounts for <10% of ethanol oxidation by the liver [42]. The patient’s response to antibiotics on the first occasion and less responsiveness on the second occasion may have been due to his fever and hypermetabolic state as well as hyperperfusion secondary to the patient’s fever, causing a boost in basal metabolism, resulting in further degradation of the toxic compound (i.e. methanol) and patient’s recovery. Our patient had history of several episodes of hypoglycemia. It is well known that alcohol can cause hypoglycemia through different mechanisms [43,44]. Inconsistently, the patient exhibited insulin resistance immediately before appearance of the main symptoms of the illness, with both glucose and insulin being high in that period. The exact correlation between methanol and insulin has not been studied, but there is a rich literature regarding ethanol and insulin resistance [45]. Some studies concluded that ethanol could induce insulin resistance [46,47], while others showed that ethanol could reduce insulin resistance [48,49]. Insulin resistance in this patient may be the result of repeated and excess simple carbohydrate administration by the parents for the compensation of hypoglycemia that resulted in elevated insulin secretion and consequently transient insulin resistance. Interestingly, neither hypoglycemia nor insulin resistance was observed when zinc treatments were initiated. There is also evidence in the literature that insulin could raise blood alcohol level by lowering CYP2E1 mRNA and protein expression and reducing its metabolism [50]. On the other hand, Repaglinide is a major substrate of CYP3A4 [51] which might trigger the elevation of methanol in a previously compromised enzyme deficiency state. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a defect in methanol metabolism. In our patient, a disorder in the alcohol degradation pathway can be attributed to a novel homozygous mutation in the ADH1C gene. This theory is reinforced by the finding that both of the patient’s parents were heterozygous for this mutation, with no evidence of methanol accumulation in their blood."
6,Conclusion,"A previously unreported inborn error of metabolism has been demonstrated. The indications were an elevated plasma methanol level with undetectable levels of formaldehyde and formic acid, in a patient who had not consumed alcohol of any type, and with a presentation that included intoxicated behaviour. The clinical and biochemical symptoms appeared to be attributable to a novel mutation in the ADH1C gene, which according to the ACMG classification, should be classified as a pathogenic variant. We also report the effective treatment for this genetic disease with zinc supplementation. The results presented in this case report may be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of similar cases, which to this point may have gone unnoticed and untreated."
