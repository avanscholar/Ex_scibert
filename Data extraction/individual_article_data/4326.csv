0,Introduction,"Continued growth in energy demands will require a continued supply of inexpensive and sustainable resources. In addition, concerns about greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels are generating new sets of technological requirements. Instead of using fossil fuels, if biomass is used, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would remain constant. Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) is one of the most promising technologies for conversion of biomass into energy sources and chemical feedstock. SCWG method offers a good opportunity to gasify high moisture content biomass, also water serves as hydrogen donor and a reaction medium. Ionic and free-radical reactions are affected by the critical condition of water. Ionic reactions mechanism is dominant below the critical point because of high ionic product of water. At temperature above the critical point, density of water is lower and free-radical reactions mechanism dominates to produce gaseous products. In the last two decades, Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe in Germany, U.S. Pacific Northwest Laboratory, National Institute for Resources and Environment in Japan, Hawaii Natural Energy Institute and other research centers have had many detailed studies on SCWG of some organic compounds to produce hydrogen. To understand chemistry of biomass conversion to degradation products and intermediates, SCWG studies in literature mainly focused on gasification of model compounds (cellulose, glucose, xylan and lignin) and real biomass [1–5]. Yoshida and Matsumura were tried to explain interaction between cellulose, xylan (hemicellulose) and lignin. They prepared cellulose/organosolv-lignin, cellulose/xylan and organosolv-lignin/xylan mixtures to gasify at 673K, 25MPa and a reaction time of 20min. They reported that presence of lignin suppress production of hydrogen [6]. The subcritical and supercritical water gasification of cellulose, starch, and glucose as representative biomass model compounds and biomass has been investigated in a heated batch reactor. The results have shown that differences in chemical structures produce significantly different product yields [7]. Investigation of parametric effects of pressure, temperature, residence time, reactor size, reactor types, heating rate, reactor wall properties, biomass types, particle size, catalysts and solution concentration, on biomass gasification in supercritical water (SCW) was important to optimize process conditions and overcome technical problems such as chars and tars formation. However, catalysis should be the solution to obtain higher yields of hydrogen and to decrease the amounts of chars and tars. Principal types of catalysts that have been used for SCW gasification are metal catalysts, alkali catalysts, carbon based catalysts. Sınag et al. investigated influence of catalyst (K2CO3 and Raney Nickel) and heating rate on gasification of glucose at 500°C, 30MPa and 1h reaction time in a batch reactor. They found that the relative yields of H2 increase twice as much as without catalyst in the presence of K2CO3 and more CH4 is formed in the presence of nickel, which is a hydrogenation catalyst [8]. Kruse et al. tried to explain the chemistry of biomass degradation and key compounds which are intermediates of the biomass degradation. Effect of K2CO3 catalyst was assumed to be caused by complex formation, acidity/basicity or the presence of active hydrogen due to the water-gas shift reaction [9]. Yoshida et al. [10] found that increasing the amount of Ni catalyst improved the gasification efficiency of cellulose, lignin and cellulose-lignin mixture at 400°C, 25MPa and for a 20min reaction time. Xu et al. [11] and Matsumura et al. [12] studied the effect of carbon catalysts in the gasification of model biomass, glucose in supercritical water at 600°C and 34.5MPa. Most carbon catalyst increased the carbon gasification efficiency while reducing the CO content of the gaseous products. This was apparently due to the enhanced rates of both the water-gas shift reaction and the methanation reaction. Novelty of this study is the usage of natural mineral catalysts in SCWG of biomass. The studies are presented on conventional gasification of biomass with alkali and natural mineral catalysts. Mudge et al. [13] studied the catalytic steam gasification of wood using alkali carbonates and naturally occurring minerals at 550–750°C. They reported the effectiveness of four different catalysts as K2CO3 >Na2CO3 >Trona [Na3(CO3)(HCO3)·2H2O]>Borax [Na2B4O7·10H2O]. They found that impregnated catalysts had little or no carbon deposition as compared to the mixed catalysts. When the biomass was directly impregnated with the catalyst (K2CO3 or Na2CO3 on alumina support), gas yields were low and there was a higher methane content. Orıo et al. investigated Dolomites for oxygen/steam gasification of wood in a downstream catalytic reactor. The increase in gas yield was 10–20vol.%, resulting in an increase of 15% in the lower heating value of the gas. The hydrogen content of the gas increased by 4vol.%, while the content of CO, CO2 and CH4 was relatively unchanged [14]. Turkey has a great agricultural production potential arising out of its ecological and climatological conditions, land property and rich crop pattern. Due to these factors, Turkey is one of the most favored countries in terms of agricultural production. Based on reports of Turkish Statistical Institute in 2010, cereal (wheat, barley, maize, bean, red lentil, sugar beet, etc.) production is 32.7 million tonnes with a decreasing rate of 2.5% when compared to the previous year. According to this statistical result, cotton and tobacco productions were 2.1 million tonnes and 55 thousand tonnes, respectively. The most of agricultural residues formed in Turkey from wheat, barley, maize and cotton with total annual amount of 50–65Mtonnes [15]. The effectiveness of naturally occurring mineral catalysts is important to the development of a commercia1 hydrogen-producing biomass gasification process. Based on the relative costs of the feedstock, use of these materials would be more favorable to process economics than would pure alkali carbonates. An additional consideration is that cost and availability of these materials may be such that catalyst recovery would be unnecessary. In this study, sub- and supercritical water gasification of some agricultural residues from Turkey such as tobacco and cotton stalks was performed in a batch reactor system at a temperature range of 300–600°C. The main objectives of this study are to investigate the effect of temperature and natural mineral catalysts (Trona, Dolomite and Borax) on production of hydrogen and some valuable chemicals from a renewable source."
1,Experimental,
2,Samples,"2.1 Samples In this work, two different types of biomass residues were used. These agricultural biomass samples were tobacco stalk and cotton stalk. Biomass samples were dried at opened-air conditions. These samples were grounded until the desired particle size was obtained and sieved to get <0.5-mm fractions. Elemental analysis of samples was performed using an elemental analyzer (CHNS-932 by Leco, MI, USA). Proximate and ultimate analysis of biomass samples were given in Table 1 . Cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin content of biomasses were analyzed by method of Van Soest [16] and given in Table 2 . Trona [Na3(CO3)(HCO3)·2H2O], Dolomite [CaMg(CO3)2] and Borax [Na2B4O7·10H2O] minerals were used as received. Compositions of these minerals were given in Table 3 . Trona and Borax were dissolved in water to obtain concentration of 10%wt. Dolomite mineral was used directly. Trona (Beypazarı, Ankara), Dolomite and Borax (Eskişehir) were mined in Turkey."
3,Reactor system,"2.2 Reactor system The sub- and supercritical water gasification of residue of agricultural biomass samples were performed in a stainless steel batch reactor. The reactor has a volume of 100mL and designed to withstand a maximum temperature and pressure of 650°C and 40MPa, respectively. The reactor assembly included a rotating shaker with an eccentric and a temperature controller with a PID controller. Schematic presentation of batch autoclave was given in a previous study [17]."
4,Experimental procedure,"2.3 Experimental procedure Desired amount of biomass sample and water (1.2g of biomass/15mL of water) was placed into autoclave. Experiments were performed without and with adding 10wt.% of natural mineral catalysts. The inside of the reactor was swept by an inert gas stream (nitrogen) for 5min to remove air. The reactor was heated with a heating rate of 6Kmin−1 to the desired temperature and held at this temperature for 1h. Maximum pressure reached for all reaction temperatures and catalyst types were given in Table 4 . At the end of each run, the reactor was cooled down to ambient temperature under atmospheric conditions. Volume of the gaseous product was measured by a gasometer and gas samples were taken using gas tight syringes. The gas volume was measured in ±10% accuracy. The products remaining in the reactor were washed with water and filtered to separate solid residue. pH of aqueous products was lowered to 2 by addition of 1–2 drops of concentrated sulphuric acid which was required to inhibit ionization of organic acids. Detailed explanation on analysis of samples of the gaseous, aqueous and solid products was given in Section 2.4. Carbon balance of product yields (gaseous, aqueous and residue) closed within 94–99%. The missing carbon in the balance may be owing to by-products such as sticky brown humin polymers formed and smeared on the inside walls of autoclave, cannot be analyzed. All experiments were performed in triplicate with a resulting precision of product yields about 5%."
5,Product analysis,"2.4 Product analysis 2.4.1 Gaseous product analysis A gas chromatograph (HP 6890, Canada/USA) was equipped with serially connected HP Plot Q (30m long, 0.53mm I.D.) and HP Molesieve (30m long, 0.53mm I.D.) columns. Thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and flame ionization detector (FID) were arranged serially by using a special adapter. Argon was used as carrier gas and oven temperature program was in the following: 45°C isothermal for 2min, 40°Cmin−1 to 60°C isothermal for 14min and 10°Cmin−1 to 250°C isothermal for 10.5min. GC was calibrated with standard gas mixture supplied by HatGaz Company in Kocaeli, Turkey. The composition of the gaseous products (H2, CO2, CO and C1–C4 hydrocarbons) was determined by gas chromatographic methods. The standard deviation for the results of gas composition was calculated to be ±2%. 2.4.2 Aqueous product analysis A TOC analyzer (Shimadzu TOC-VCPH, Japan) was used to determine total organic carbon (TOC) content of aqueous phase. The concentration of total phenols was determined by using Jenway Colorimeter (Model 6051, UK). Light source is tungsten filament lamp and measurements were performed at 470nm. The amounts of carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones, furfurals and phenols present in the aqueous solutions were analyzed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC, Japan). All HPLC analyses were carried out using a Shimadzu LC-20A series liquid chromatography device equipped with a Intersil ODS-3 (250mm length×4.6mm I.D.) column. The HPLC system consisted of a DGU-20AS degassing module, LC-20AT gradient pump, CTO-10ASVP chromatography oven and SPD-20 multi-wavelength ultraviolet detector. Analysis of calibration standards repeated for 5 times and calibration curves were prepared by plotting a linear regression of the average response factor versus analyte concentration. Carboxylic acids, phenols and furfurals were analyzed according to Method I (mobile phases: A: 0.05% vol. H3PO4 (pH: 2.25) – B: CH3CN/H2O (80/20: vol./vol.), flowrate: 1mL/min, detector: UV, low temperature gradient program of mobile phase and detector: 0min 90% A and 10% B, 0min detector wavelength 210nm, 5min detector wavelength 290nm, 7min detector wavelength 285nm, 11min detector wavelength 278nm, 15min detector wavelength 232nm, 17min 90% A and 10% B, 19min detector wavelength 290nm, 25min 65% A and 35% B, 27.5min detector wavelength 290nm, 55min 65% A and 35%, column temperature: 30°C). Aldehydes and ketones were analyzed by applying Method II (mobile phases: A: water – B: methanol, flowrate: 1mL/min, detector: UV (at 365nm), low temperature gradient program of mobile phase: 0min 35% A and 65% B, 5min 35% A and 65% B, 15min 15% A and 85% B, 30min 10% A and 90% B, Column temperature: 30°C). The aldehydes and ketones were derivatized to their hydrozone forms by addition of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine to aqueous samples. 2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazone forms of aldehydes and ketones were separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography as the same method described in the literature [18]. 2.4.3 Residue analysis Solid sample module of a TOC analyzer (Shimadzu TOC-VCPH-SSM-5000A, Japan) was used to determine the total organic carbon (TOC) content of the solid residue."
6,Results and discussion,"In this study, SCWG of two types of different agricultural biomass residues (tobacco and cotton stalks) were studied. Yield and composition of gaseous and aqueous products formed during SCWG of biomasses were investigated as a function of temperature and catalyst type. Because of different carbon content of biomass samples, product yields were expressed in the unit kg C in biomass instead of kg biomass. Contributions of this study to literature in this field [19,20] are diversity of catalysts used and wide range of operating temperature (300–600°C). The operating conditions can be called as subcritical at temperature of 300°C, near-critical at temperature of 400°C and supercritical at temperatures of 500 and 600°C. Fundamental reactions of conventional cellulose gasification are pyrolysis, partial oxidation and steam gasification. Pyrolysis is the thermal decomposition of feedstock into gaseous, liquid and solid products without oxygen or steam. Partial oxidation reaction occurs in the presence of less than the stoichiometric amount of oxygen required for complete combustion. Steam reforming involves the reaction until the biomass-denoted feedstock to evolve CO, CO2 and H2. All of these reactions give products involving CO, H2, CO2 and CH4 rich gases and CO consumption reach to a high value for the reaction. But in SCW, the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction (CO+H2O⇔CO2 +H2) and methanation reaction (CO+3H2 ⇔CH4 +H2O and/or CO2 +4H2 ⇔CH4 +2H2O) are two other important SCW reaction that occur during gasification resulting until the formation of less CO but more CO2, CH4 and H2 rich gas."
7,Effect of temperature and catalyst type on gaseous product yield and composition,"3.1 Effect of temperature and catalyst type on gaseous product yield and composition Experimental studies were performed at temperature interval of 300–600°C and in the absence and presence of natural mineral catalysts (Trona, Dolomite and Borax). The product yield obtained from SCWG of tobacco and cotton stalks were given in Figs. 1 and 2 in terms of wt.%, respectively. The yield of gaseous product increases with increasing temperature. Significant increase in gaseous product yield was obtained by changing reaction conditions from subcritical (<374°C) to supercritical condition (>374°C). Gaseous product yield of tobacco stalk at 600 °C was increased by 7.5% with Trona, 7.8% with Dolomite and 9.9% with Borax. Also, gaseous product yield of cotton stalk at 600 °C was improved by 17.2% with Trona, 14.3% with Dolomite and 18.9% with Borax. As cotton stalk comprised of much lignin which is difficult to gasify, gaseous product yield and hydrogen yield of cotton stalk were found lower compared with results of tobacco stalk for all reaction temperatures and catalyst types. In SCWG of tobacco and cotton stalks, gaseous product yields were found slightly higher when Trona used as catalyst. The catalytic effects of natural mineral catalysts (Trona, Dolomite and Borax) on gaseous product yields at different temperature were given for tobacco and cotton stalks in Figs. 3 and 4 in terms of mol gas/kg C in biomass, respectively. It was found that, gaseous products were composed of hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane as major components and carbon monoxide, ethane, ethene, propane, propene, butane and butene were as minors. As seen in Figs. 3 and 4, like alkali catalysts, mineral catalysts improve hydrogen and carbon dioxide yields. In SCWG of tobacco stalk, yields of CH4 and H2 gases were found slightly higher when Trona used as catalyst. Since, WGS reaction consume carbon monoxide, low yields of carbon monoxide was obtained in catalytic studies. Yanik et al. [20] were gasified sunflower stalk and corncob in batch reactor at 500°C. They reported that H2 yield (mol H2/kg C in feed) of sunflower stalk (9.7wt.% of lignin) was improved from 10.1 to 26.8 and 26.1 by using K2CO3 and Trona, respectively. H2 yield of corncob (3.4wt.% of lignin) was increased from 4.9 to 18.6 and 27.7 by using K2CO3 and Trona, respectively. Presence of Trona nearly triplicates H2 yield which was better than results in SCWG of tobacco and cotton stalks with higher lignin content. At 600°C, hydrogen yield of tobacco stalk was increased by 42.9% with Trona, 15.6% with Dolomite and 30.2% with Borax. Hydrogen yield of cotton stalk at 600°C was enhanced by 39.9% with Trona, 22.3% with Dolomite and 34.2% with Borax. Hydrogen gas yield of cotton stalk was found lower compared with results of tobacco stalk for all reaction temperatures and catalyst types. This situation can be explained by difference in composition of biomasses. When cotton stalk composition was considered, its lignin content (19.4wt.%) is higher compared with tobacco stalk (13.4wt.%). From literature knowledge [6], lignin suppresses gasification efficiency. Lignin structure gain hydrogen during the depolymerization, so decrease in hydrogen amount is understandable. Both presence of mineral catalysts and high reaction temperature increased carbon dioxide and methane yields which are being thermodynamically stable species. Effect of Trona like as alkali salts [9,21] on SCWG gaseous products was explained by formation of formate salts through WGS reaction [22]. 3.1.1 For Trona Na 2 CO 3 · NaHCO 3 · 2 H 2 O → H 2 O 2 NaHCO 3 + NaOH + H 2 O NaOH + CO → Δ , P HCOONa HCOONa + H 2 O → Δ NaHCO 3 + H 2 2 NaHCO 3 → Δ CO 2 + Na 2 CO 3 + H 2 O The effect of Dolomite and Borax on H2 production can be explained by the catalyzed water-gas shift reaction: 3.1.2 For Dolomite 2 CaCO 3 · MgCO 3 + 4 H 2 O → Ca ( HCO 3 ) 2 + Mg ( HCO 3 ) 2 + Ca ( OH ) 2 + Mg ( OH ) 2 Ca ( OH ) 2 + Mg ( OH ) 2 + 4 CO → Δ , P Ca ( OOCH ) 2 + Mg ( OOCH ) 2 Ca ( OOCH ) 2 + Mg ( OOCH ) 2 + 4 H 2 O → Δ Ca ( HCO 3 ) 2 + Mg ( HCO 3 ) 2 + 4 H 2 2 Ca ( HCO 3 ) 2 + 2 Mg ( HCO 3 ) 2 → Δ 2 CaCO 3 + 2 MgCO 3 + 4 H 2 O + 4 CO 2 3.1.3 For Borax Na 2 B 4 O 7 · 10 H 2 O → H 2 O H 2 B 4 O 7 + 2 NaOH + 10 H 2 O ( or 4 H 3 BO 3 + 2 NaOH + 3 H 2 O ) 2 NaOH + 2 CO → Δ , P 2 HCOONa 2 HCOONa + 2 H 2 O → Δ 2 NaHCO 3 + 2 H 2 2 NaHCO 3 → Δ + CO 2 + Na 2 CO 3 + H 2 O The effectiveness for three different natural mineral catalysts in SCWG can be classified as being Trona [Na3(CO3)(HCO3)·2H2O]>Borax [Na2B4O7·10H2O]>Dolomite [CaMg(CO3)2]. Product yields were found lower especially for Dolomite catalyst. Dolomite is a cheap natural sedimentary rock containing calcium and magnesium ores and found all over the world. If the CO2 partial pressure is too high, Dolomite is not a good catalyst when gasification is highly pressurized."
8,Effect of temperature and catalyst type on aqueous product yield and composition,"3.2 Effect of temperature and catalyst type on aqueous product yield and composition Yields of dissolved oxygenated products in aqueous phase and residue obtained from SCWG of tobacco and cotton stalks were given in Figs. 1 and 2 in terms of wt.%, respectively. Significant decrease in aqueous product yield was obtained by changing reaction conditions from subcritical (<374°C) to supercritical conditions (>374°C). Transition from single-phase state to two-phase state strongly affects the product yield and composition. Aqueous product yield of tobacco stalk at 600 °C was lowered by 28.1% with Trona, 27.3% with Dolomite and 16.7% with Borax. Also, aqueous product yield of cotton stalk at 600 °C was decreased by 41.5% with Trona, 47.9% with Dolomite and 44.4% with Borax. The yield of aqueous product and solid residue decreased due to the WGS and methanation reactions catalyzed by mineral catalyst at elevated temperature. Total organic carbon (TOC) of aqueous products decreases with increasing temperature, as the formed aqueous products degraded into gaseous products (Figs. 5 and 6 ). Moreover, TOC of aqueous products in each temperature vary with the catalyst type. TOC of aqueous products increased in the presence of natural mineral catalysts at subcritical (300°C) and near-critical (400°C) conditions while decreased at supercritical conditions. This situation may be caused by formation of some compounds (i.e. sodium acetate) with reaction of sodium (for Trona and Borax), calcium or magnesium (for Dolomite) and carboxylic acids (i.e. acetic acid, formic acid). These compounds complicate gasification and TOC content of aqueous products found higher at 300–400°C. Variation of TOC content of aqueous products with catalyst type may be explained by difference of valence electron of mineral catalysts. 3.2.1 Interpretation of experimental results with reference to prior knowledge The aqueous products contain large number of compounds and the composition of main components was identified partially. Since cellulose and lignin degradation products are mainly composed of carboxylic acids, furfurals, phenols and aldehydes [9,23], we mainly identify and quantify these compounds. Gasification reactions start with the hydrolysis of cellulose at ∼200°C. In aqueous alkali media, glucose is converted to d-fructose and d-mannose. Glucose or fructose is converted to some organic intermediates like formic acid, acetic acid, furfural, 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (5-HMF) and phenols depending on the reaction pathway. Acetic acid in biomass hydrolyzates is derived primarily from deacetylation of the hemicellulose xylan side chains. Formic acid meanwhile arises from the degradation of furfural or 5-HMF, both of which are derived from the dehydration of xylose or glucose, respectively. In SCW, acids, aldehydes, furfurals and phenols can react to produce gaseous products at elevated temperature. Phenol and cresols (o-, m-, and p-cresols) are ones of the aqueous intermediates of biomass degradation products. Supercritical water is a possible solvent that can dissolve and hydrolyze lignin for potentially production of phenolic chemicals. Essential part of the degradation products of lignin is furfurals and phenols. These compounds are also degraded into gaseous products but much slower than small aliphatic hydrocarbons. Even more, these aromatic compounds are generally responsible from formation of unwanted tar and residue [24]. Variation of selected aqueous product yields (based on g aqueous product/kg C in biomass) for SCWG of tobacco and cotton stalks with temperature and catalyst were given in Tables 5 and 6 , respectively. The composition of liquid products changes as the temperatures decrease from mixed oxygenated compounds (i.e. acids, aldehydes, ketones, furan, alcohols, and phenols) to phenolic ether and alkyl phenols (i.e. phenols, benzofuran, benzaldehyde and catechols) in gasification. HPLC and colorimeter results revealed that yield of phenol and total phenols (based on g phenol/kg C in biomass) increased up to 500°C and sharply decrease at 600°C. This situation can be explained by degradation with free radical reaction mechanism at the high temperatures. Yield of analyzed other aqueous products like carboxylic acids (hydroxyacetic acid, formic acid and acetic acid), furfurals (5-methyl furfural, 5-HMF), 1,4 dioxane, aldehydes and ketones (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone and 3-methyl-2-cyclopentene-1-on) decreased with increasing temperature from 300°C to 600°C. The highest yield of aqueous products was obtained at subcritical condition (300°C). Formation of 5-HMF from glucose or fructose in SCW by acid-catalyzed water elimination reactions without addition of any catalyst was explained by Kruse et al. They suggest that around 300–350°C intermediate products are converted into new organics by pyrolysis, dehydration, ring closure and aromatization. Furthermore, 5-HMF degraded into furfural, 5-methyl furfural (5-MF) and 1,2,4 trihydroxybenzene at 340°C [9]. Formaldehyde is not stable in SCW, and its decomposition is highly dependent on temperature. At temperatures above the critical temperature of water, formaldehyde reacts to completion to form methanol, formic acid, CO and CO2. CO is the main product at higher reaction temperatures and methanol at lower reaction temperatures. This conversion of formaldehyde by a Cannizzaro reaction into methanol, formic acid and carbon monoxide affords the possibility of transforming dilute formaldehyde into easily separable methanol. Formic acid decomposes preferentially into CO and H2O (dehydration) at low temperatures (300°C) and at higher temperatures (>380°C), the reaction pathway switches to the production of H2 and CO2 (decarboxylation) [25]. Up to temperatures of 400°C, acetic acid does not decompose. Above that temperature, limited reaction to the extent of 2% was found by Meyer et al. According to this study, decomposition of acetic acid in the temperature range of 475–600°C and at 24.6MPa results principally in CH4 and CO2 [26]. It can be concluded that, the highest aqueous product yields for all analyzed compounds were found when Trona was used as catalyst in SCWG of tobacco and cotton stalks. The main components of aqueous products for both biomasses were acetic acid, hydroxyacetic acid, 5-MF and formic acid. High concentration of carboxylic acids in the presence of mineral catalysts may be due to formation of sodium, calcium or magnesium formates as described in the reactions in Section 3.1. Considering the 5-HMF yield, the results are consistent with earlier literature reports obtained from the gasification of glucose [8], 5-HMF yield is reduced. But, it is not possible to clarify whether formation of 5-HMF is inhibited or its degradation is promoted by catalyst addition. As furfurals can polymerize, they can be regarded as unwanted products. The addition of mineral catalyst leads to a reduced yield of unwanted furfurals. An advantage of the use of mineral catalyst is a decreased phenol content that can be gasified at 600°C."
9,Conclusion,"• In this study, the catalytic gasification of agricultural residues (tobacco and cotton stalk) from Turkey was investigated in SCW. • Natural minerals (Trona, Dolomite and Borax) were used as catalysts. All types of the catalysts improve hydrogen and carbon dioxide yield by lowering carbon monoxide yield through WGS reaction. • Gaseous product and hydrogen yields were found slightly higher when Trona used as catalyst for both of tobacco and cotton stalks. • Since cotton stalk comprised of much lignin which is difficult to gasify, gaseous product and hydrogen yields of cotton stalk were found lower compared with results of tobacco stalk for all reaction temperatures and catalyst types. • The highest aqueous product yields for all analyzed compounds were found when Trona was used as catalyst in SCWG of tobacco and cotton stalks. • It can be concluded that it will be better to use natural minerals as catalysts in SCWG, because of low cost, availability and unnecessity of recovery."
