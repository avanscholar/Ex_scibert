0,Introduction,"Studies investigating the physiological effects of hydrogen gas (H2) have rapidly increased since the discovery of its strong antioxidative effects and demonstration of its potential use in reducing pathological symptoms in a rat model of cerebrovascular infarction (Ohsawa et al., 2007). The effectiveness of H2 inhalation or ingestion of H2-dissolved aqueous solutions (hydrogen water) has been demonstrated in 31 diseases (Ichihara, Sobue, Ito, Hirayama, & Ohno, 2015). Although approximately 75% of these studies utilized animal models, the number of clinical studies is also increasing every year. The effectiveness of H2 as an anti-inflammatory agent for ischemia-reperfusion injury mitigation, in the prevention of metabolic syndrome, and for protection of the central nervous system has also been reported (Ohta, 2014). Moreover, our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the antioxidative effects of H2 on free radicals, such as hydroxyl radicals, and on a variety of other important biological molecules, such as Lyn, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, Akt, GTP-Rac1, inducible nitric oxide synthase, Nox1, nuclear factor kappa B p65, inhibitor of kappa B alpha, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, nuclear factor of activated T cells 1, c-Fos, and ghrelin, has also improved (Ichihara et al., 2015). Importantly, H2 has no known adverse side effects, even at high concentrations (Ohta, 2014), and can therefore be utilized in functional food products. Mammals do not possess the hydrogenase enzyme (Adams, Mortenson, & Chen, 1980; Fritsch, Lenz, & Friedrich, 2013). Therefore, endogenous H2 does not exist in mammals and can only be supplied from outside the body. Currently, H2 inhalation and ingestion of H2-dissolved aqueous solutions (H2 water) have been reported as the primary physiologically means of supplying H2 to the body. However, since H2 absorption requires a special apparatus, consumption of H2 water is more common due to its simplicity. Unfortunately, H2 obtained through consumption of H2 water is transient and only remains in the body for approximately 30min (Shimouchi, Nose, Yamaguchi, Ishiguro, & Kondo, 2009). Alternatively, when indigestible components reach the large intestine, intestinal bacteria consume these materials to produce short-chain fatty acids, H2, carbon dioxide, and other substances (Fischbach & Sonnenburg, 2011; Flint, Bayer, Rincon, Lamed, & White, 2008); this H2 disperses systemically via portal circulation, while a portion is excreted via the lungs during exhalation (Hammer, 1993; Levitt, 1969). Thus, the potential efficacy of H2 water for reducing systemic oxidative stress, in the same manner as ingestion of indigestible materials, has become a research topic of interest (Kajiya et al., 2009; Nishimura, Tanabe, Adachi, Yamamoto, & Fukushima, 2013; Nishimura et al., 2012; Tanabe, Sasaki, Yamamoto, Kiriyama, & Nishimura, 2012; Zhai et al., 2013). Dietary fiber (nondigestible carbohydrates and lignin, which are intrinsic and intact in plants) including functional fiber (isolated, nondigestible carbohydrates that have been shown to have beneficial physiologic effects in humans) (Institute of Medicine, 2005), may be capable of inducing H2 production. These dietary fibers include fructooligosaccharides (Nishimura et al., 2013; Oku & Nakamura, 2003), inulin (Nishimura et al., 2013), pectin (Nishimura et al., 2012), resistant starches (Nishimura et al., 2012; Tanabe et al., 2012), turmeric (curcuma) (Shimouchi, Nose, Takaoka, Hayashi, & Kondo, 2009), lactulose (Zhai et al., 2013) and lactose (milk) (Shimouchi et al., 2009). The intestinal microbiome varies significantly between individuals; therefore, dietary fiber capable of inducing H2 production can also vary among individuals. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have assessed H2 production induced by dietary fiber. One previous study compared the quantities of H2 produced by exhalation following ingestion of eight different ingredients to calculate the energy content of dietary fiber (Oku & Nakamura, 2014). Approximately 65–70% of the world’s population exhibits lactose intolerance based on phenotype and genotype analyses, and the prevalence of lactose intolerance is strongly linked to ethnicity; the prevalence is low in individuals of northern European descent (approximately 15%); moderate in African, Latino, eastern European, and South American populations (70–80%); and high in many Asian populations (near 100%) (Corgneau et al., 2015; Itan, Jones, Ingram, Swallow, & Thomas, 2010; Lomer, Parkes, & Sanderson, 2008). Notably, although more recent studies are needed, the prevalence of lactose intolerance in the Japanese population was previously reported to be approximately 90% (Nose et al., 1979); consistent with this, a recent study of individuals worldwide also showed that the lactase persistence phenotype and genotype are low (Itan et al., 2010). Although many Japanese individuals have lactose intolerance, their symptoms are mild, and they can drink approximately 200mL normal cow’s milk. In fact, the Japan Dairy Association reported that approximately 63.2% of Japanese individuals drink milk more than one time a week (Japan Dairy Association, 2016). Although lactose is viewed as a negative food component for adults, it contributes to H2 production via the intestinal bacteria. In addition, given that only mammalian milk contains high concentrations of lactose, cows’ milk containing approximately 5% lactose is also a natural food source that is capable of promoting H2 production. In a Japanese collaborative cohort study, age-adjusted all-cause mortality rates decreased with increasing frequency of cows’ milk consumption in both men and women compared with that in individuals who never drank milk (Wang, Yatsuya, Tamakoshi, Iso, & Tamakoshi, 2015). Here, we report the identification of a combination of dietary fibers that are capable of inducing H2 production in a large number of people through fecal cultivation system assessment. We also added this combination to normal milk and demonstrated its impact on H2 production through clinical studies. Therefore, we have developed a novel functional beverage product that enables efficient supply of H2 to the body."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Dietary fiber,"2.1 Dietary fiber Oligosaccharides, sugar alcohols, and primarily edible soluble and insoluble dietary fibers were evaluated in this study. Specifically, we tested isomaltooligosaccharides, fructooligosaccharides (FOSs), galactooligosaccharides (GOSs), xylooligosaccharides, lactose, cellobiose, xylitol, sorbitol, erythritol, maltitol, mannitol, pectin, sodium alginate, glucomannan, cellulose, lignin, chitin, chitosan, resistant starch, indigestible dextrin, reduced indigestible dextrin, kale, and green barley, which have all been proposed as candidates for classification as dietary fiber. Each ingredient was prepared in advance as a 2.5% (w/v) solution or suspension using phosphate-buffer saline (PBS), aliquoted, placed in cold storage (−20°C), and thawed immediately before testing."
3,Screening of dietary fiber via fecal culture,"2.2 Screening of dietary fiber via fecal culture Fecal samples were collected from 10 healthy adults (seven men and three women with an average age of 35years and 10months). Samples were placed in an anaerobic state immediately after collection using Anaero Pack Kenki (Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Co., Tokyo, Japan), followed by cold storage until use. Fecal samples were used in culture experiments within 5h after defecation. Approximately 5g of fecal sample was added to 20mL of an anaerobic dilution solution (solution prepared by dissolving KH2PO4, Na2HPO4, l-cysteine HCl, Tween 80, and 0.1% resazurin, then injecting a N2/CO2 [80%/20%] composite gas, sealing using a butyl rubber stopper, and processing with an autoclave). After mixing the samples using a vortex, the remaining solid components, such as undigested food particles, were removed through weak centrifugation (1000g for 1min). Portions of the upper layer (160µL) of the fecal suspension were dispensed into 1.5-mL Eppendorf Safe-Lock Tubes, and 40μL of each indigestible candidate solution was added (final candidate concentration: 0.5%). PBS without addition of these components was used as a control. The fecal suspension and indigestible components that had been combined in tubes were added to glass vials (40mm×75mm, 50mL) with their lids open. Next, a N2/CO2 (80%/20%) composite gas was injected into the Eppendorf tubes and vials using a deoxygenized gas pressure and replace injector, AG-2 (Sanshin Industrial Co. Ltd. Yokohama, Japan), in order to place the mixture into an anaerobic state. The containers were sealed using butyl rubber stoppers and were placed into incubators for cultivation (24h at 37°C). This procedure was performed twice for each sample. This fecal study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Kyodo Milk (permit no.: 2013h-01)."
4,Measurement of H2 concentration,"2.3 Measurement of H2 concentration The gas contained in the vials was stirred five times using a 1-mL Gas Tight syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA). Next, samples (0.5mL) were collected and measured using a TRIlyzer mBA-3000 (TAIYO Instrument INC., Osaka, Japan). Samples were diluted 50-fold with air if the concentration of gas in the samples exceeded detection limits. The dilution was performed as follows: 1mL gas in the vial was collected and injected into 50mL air in a glass vial with a butyl rubber stopper; this mixture was stirred using a 1-mL gas-tight syringe."
5,Extraction of fecal bacterial DNA,"2.4 Extraction of fecal bacterial DNA Fecal bacterial DNA was extracted using the methods described by Matsuki, Watanabe, Fujimoto, Takada, and Tanaka (2004), with some modifications. Briefly, 20mg of fecal samples was directly suspended in 600μL of extraction buffer containing 55mM Tris-HCl, 30mM EDTA, and 0.8% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The suspension was mixed with 500μL of TE-saturated phenol, incubated at 70°C for 10min in a water bath, and vortexed vigorously with 300mg of glass beads (diameter, 0.1mm) for 60s using a Micro Smash MS-100 (Tomy Digital Biology Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at 4000rpm."
6,Construction of a 16S rRNA amplicon library and next-generation sequencing,"2.5 Construction of a 16S rRNA amplicon library and next-generation sequencing The V1-V2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with fusion primers. The forward primer contained an Ion A adapter followed by a key, barcode, adapter (GT), and 27Fmod primer sequence (3′-AGRGTTTGATYMTGGCTCAG-5′). The reverse primer had an Ion truncated P1 adapter and 338R primer sequence (3′-TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT-5′) (Kim et al., 2013). PCR, DNA purification, emulsion PCR, and sequencing were performed on an Ion PGM system according to the manufacturer’s instructions."
7,Data processing and sequence alignment,"2.6 Data processing and sequence alignment Sequence data were obtained in FASTQ format and analyzed using QIIME software (Caporaso et al., 2010). Raw sequences were sorted according to the barcode and screened using an average quality score of 20 or more and the priming sites to obtain sequences of approximately 300bp. The trimmed sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at the level of 97% similarity. The most abundant sequence in the OTU was chosen as the representative sequence. The representative sequences were aligned and checked for potential chimeric sequences using the ChimeraSlayer algorithm. Nonchimeric sequences were assigned to a taxon using the RDP Classifier (Wang, Garrity, Tiedje, & Cole, 2007) at a confidence cutoff value of 80%."
8,Effects of ingestion of H2-producing milk on H2 concentrations in the human breath (clinical study),"2.7 Effects of ingestion of H2-producing milk on H2 concentrations in the human breath (clinical study) 2.7.1 Experiment 1 This study was an open-label, single arm, comparative trial involving healthy adults. The food substances used in testing were as follows: dietary fiber-added milk product (1% galactooligosaccharide, 1% maltitol, and 1% glucomannan added to additive-free milk [H2-producing milk 1]), additive-free milk (cows’ milk), and commercial H2 water (1.57ppm; Melodian Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Healthy adults who consumed 200mL cows’ milk and did not experience diarrhea were recruited. We initially assessed the peak time for H2 production after drinking H2-producing milk, and volunteers whose peak H2 production period occurred 10h after ingestion were excluded from the study since long fasting periods were necessary to accurately measure H2 production. Therefore, nine healthy men with an average age of 40years were enrolled in this clinical study. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Iryouhoujinsyadan Hakusuikai SUDA Clinical Institutional Review Board and was subsequently registered in the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN-CTR; http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/index.htm) under trial ID UMIN000019957. Volunteers were hospitalized for 1day to initiate the trial. This hospitalization was repeated once per week for 3weeks. The results from consumption of H2-producing milk 1, cows’ milk, and H2 water were measured at weeks 1, 2, and 3, respectively. H2 concentrations in the breaths of volunteers following ingestion of each of the test drinks were then evaluated. Testing was initiated after volunteers had fasted for 12h (only consumption of water permitted until start) after dinner, which was required to contain foods having an abundance of dietary fibers. Volunteers were given the same dinner menu before each test for weeks 1, 2, and 3 to eliminate the influence of dinner on the results of breath H2 concentrations. Subjects ingested 100mL of commercial water containing electrolytes and monosaccharides (OS-1, Otsuka Foods Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) at two-hour intervals, starting two-hours after study initiation (2h, 4h, 6h, 8h, and 10h), and ingested rice porridge (Boncolon, Otsuka Foods Co., Ltd.) four hours after initiation of the study. By preliminary study, we confirmed that H2 concentration in breath was not increased by the ingestion of rice porridge (Supplementary Fig. 1). To measure H2 concentration in the breaths of volunteers, measurements were conducted immediately before the volunteers ingested the H2-producing milk 1 or cows’ milk and once per hour for the next 12h (13 measurements in total). Measurements were conducted immediately before the volunteers ingested the H2 water every 5min for 90min, every 10min from 90 to 120min, and once per hour from 2h to 12h. Subjects were instructed to be at rest in a sitting position 5min before their breath samples were collected. During collection, volunteers first inhaled deeply through the nose, and end-alveolar breath was collected into a breath-sampling bag (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) after 15s during exhalation. All subjects underwent training to obtain the end-alveolar breath prior to collection. Samples of the breaths of volunteers (0.5mL) were collected from these bags using gas-tight syringes, and the H2 concentration was measured using a TRIlyzer. The concentration of methane gas present in the breath was measured following the same procedure. 2.7.2 Experiment 2 A clinical test similar to that of Experimental 1 was carried out. In this experiment, the volunteers (n=21) were not hospitalized and content of dietary fibers was changed (1.5% galactooligosaccharide, 1.0% maltitol, and 0.1% glucomannan added to additive-free milk [H2-producing milk 2]). Galactooligosaccharide was increase from 1.0% to 1.5%, and glucomannan was decreased from 1.0% to 0.1% because glucomannan (1%) is difficult to handle industrially. Fifteen healthy adult men and six healthy adult women (average age: 38.5years) were enrolled in this clinical test. However, 10 volunteers refused the test for H2-water consumption before starting the evaluation, despite the consumption of H2-producing milk 2 and normal cows’ milk by all 21 volunteers, because they did not want to fast for the H2-water consumption test. Five volunteers accepted the measurement of H2 concentration during the fasting instead of consumption of test beverages. This experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Kyodo Milk (permit number: 2016h-01)."
9,Statistical analyses,"2.8 Statistical analyses A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA; related) was conducted using area-under-the-curve (AUC) values and H2 concentrations in the exhaled breath at each time point, and two-way ANOVA (repeated measures) was conducted to assess changes over time for each prebiotic ingredient tested, using IBM SPSS statistics version 22 (IBM, Tokyo, Japan)."
10,Results,
11,Selection of indigestible substances with high H2 gas production-promoting capacity,"3.1 Selection of indigestible substances with high H2 gas production-promoting capacity Control ratios of H2 concentrations for each candidate were calculated (Fig. 1 a). Value that were more than 10 times higher are colored blue. Among the prebiotic candidates, the number of volunteers exhibiting H2 production 10 times or greater than the control was as follows: isomaltooligosaccharide, five volunteers; lactose, four volunteers; FOS, seven volunteers; GOS, five volunteers; cellobiose, seven volunteers; xylooligosaccharide, one volunteer; xylitol, six volunteers; sorbitol, four volunteers; erythritol, two volunteers; maltitol, six volunteers; mannitol, five volunteers; pectin, one volunteer; glucomannan, three volunteers; resistant starch, one volunteer; indigestible dextrin, two volunteers; and reduced indigestible dextrin, two volunteers. When prebiotic ingredients were added individually, the ingredients that promoted H2 gas production differed per volunteer. These differences were likely due to variances in the intestinal microbiome between individuals. Exploring different combinations of dietary fiber among the candidates tested in this study showed that a combination of maltitol, GOS, and glucomannan was the most effective in inducing production of large quantities of H2 in all volunteers (Fig. 1b)."
12,Intestinal bacteria correlated with H2 production,"3.2 Intestinal bacteria correlated with H2 production The microbiota in feces (stocked before use) used in the selection of indigestible compounds were analyzed using Ion-PGM, and the correlations between the relative abundance of bacterial groups and the quantity of H2 production following addition of maltitol, GOS, glucomannan, and lactose were evaluated. At the family level, H2 production induced by the addition of GOS was positively correlated with the relative abundance of Rikenellaceae (R2 =0.5958), Clostridiales Incertae Sedis XIII (R2 =0.5713), and Clostridiales other families (R2 =0.5185; Fig. 2 a). At the genus level, H2 production induced by the addition of GOS was positively correlated with the relative abundance of Alistipes (R2 =0.5958), Clostridiales Incertae Sedis XIII other genera (R2 =0.7247), and Ruminococcaceae other genera (R2 =0.6965). H2 production by the addition of lactose was positively correlated with the relative abundance of Odoribacter (R2 =0.5456) and Clostridiales Incertae Sedis XIII other genera (R2 =0.571; Fig. 2b). No significant correlations were identified between H2 gas production by any prebiotic additive and any type of bacteria at the phylum, class, and order levels of taxonomy. The Alistipes genus belongs to the Rikenellaceae family, and because both were equally abundant, all Rikenellaceae bacteria detected were classified as Alistipes."
13,"Effects of ingestion of H2-producing milk, cows’ milk, and H2 water on H2 concentrations in the human breath (clinical study)","3.3 Effects of ingestion of H2-producing milk, cows’ milk, and H2 water on H2 concentrations in the human breath (clinical study) 3.3.1 Experiment 1 The data for this clinical study included results from nine enrolled volunteers. Because volunteer no. 6 exhibited higher H2 gas in the breath before consumption (0h) of cows’ milk than H2-producing milk 1 and H2 water (pre-H2-producing milk consumption: 8.8ppm, pre-milk consumption: 67.0, pre-H2 water consumption: 13.3), the data for this participant were excluded. Following consumption of H2-producing milk 1, H2 concentrations in the breath at 3–11h (p <0.01 for 3–8h, p <0.05 for 9–11h) were significantly higher than those following H2 water consumption. From 2 to 12h postconsumption, volunteers exhibited higher H2 gas concentrations in their breaths after consuming H2-producing milk 1 than after consuming normal cows’ milk. However, the difference was not significant. In the case of normal cows’ milk consumption, H2 concentrations in the breaths of volunteers at 4–8h (p <0.05 for all times) were significantly higher than those after H2 water consumption. A comparison of the H2 concentrations in the breaths of volunteers before and after consumption showed that following H2-producing milk 1 consumption, H2 concentrations after 5h were significantly higher than those before consumption (0h). Additionally, H2 concentrations after 3, 5, 6, 7, or 8h (p <0.05 for 3, 5, 6, and 7h; p <0.01 for 8h) were significantly higher than those after 1h, at which the minimum value was noted. Although an increasing trend in H2 concentrations in the breaths of volunteers was observed following normal milk consumption, the difference was not significant. There was a significant increase (p <0.01) in H2 concentration 15min after consumption of H2 water compared with that at 0h. However, the H2 concentration almost uniformly returned to baseline levels after 1h (Fig. 3 a). The maximum H2 gas concentration in the breaths of volunteers was observed after consumption of each test beverage: H2-producing milk 1, 35.3ppm at 5h; H2 water, 31.1ppm at 10min; and normal cows’ milk, 23.1ppm at 6h. The area under the curve (AUC) value for H2-producing milk 1 was significantly higher than that for H2 water (p <0.01), but was not significantly different from that for normal cows’ milk. The AUC for normal cows’ milk tended to be 2 times higher than for H2 water (p =0.07; Fig. 3b). Fluctuations observed in each volunteer are described in Fig. 3c. Although differences between volunteers were large, we confirmed that all volunteers exhibited increased H2 concentrations in their breaths from baseline values following consumption of H2-producing milk 1. Although the majority of volunteers also exhibited higher H2 concentrations in their breaths following consumption of normal cows’ milk, volunteer nos. 4 and 8 exhibited no increase in H2 concentrations, indicating that their small intestines were capable of fully breaking down lactose. In addition, many of the volunteers also exhibited H2 production for a longer period of time after consuming H2-producing milk 1 than after consuming normal cows’ milk. However, all H2 concentrations in the breaths of all volunteers peaked between 5 and 15min after consumption of H2 water. With the exception of volunteer no. 4, these concentrations returned to baseline levels after 1h. 3.3.2 Experiment 2 Although the consumption of H2-producing milk 2 and normal cows’ milk were carried out in 21 volunteers, 10 volunteers refused the test of H2 water consumption because they felt too hungry. Changes in H2 concentrations in the breath following consumption of test beverages are shown in Fig. 4 a. Following H2-producing milk 2 consumption, H2 concentrations in the breath at 3–10h (p <0.001 for 5–7h, p <0.01 for 9h, and p <0.05 for 3, 4, 8 and 10h) were significantly higher than the values recorded following H2 water consumption. Following H2-producing milk 2 consumption, H2 concentrations in the breath at 5–9h (p <0.001 for 7h, p <0.01 for 9h, p <0.05 for 5, 6, and 8h) were significantly higher than the values recorded following consumption of normal cows’ milk. In the case of normal cows’ milk consumption, H2 concentrations in the breath at 3, 5, and 6h (p <0.01 for 5 and 6h, p <0.05 for 3h) were significantly higher than the values recorded following H2 water consumption. Comparison of the H2 concentration in the breaths of volunteers before and after consumption showed that following H2-producing milk 2 consumption, H2 concentrations after 4–7h (p <0.05 for 4h, p <0.001 for 5 and 6h, and p <0.01 for 7h) were significantly higher than those preconsumption (0h). There were no significant increases in H2 concentrations after consumption of normal cows’ milk and H2 water compared with that at 0h. However, the H2 concentration tended to be increased after 10–20min and was almost uniformly returned to baseline levels after 1h. The maximum H2 gas concentration in the breath of volunteers was observed after consumption of each test beverage: H2-producing milk 2, 51.7ppm at 5h; H2 water, 36.3ppm at 10min; and normal cows’ milk, 23.1ppm at 5h. The AUC value for H2-producing milk 2 was 4.8 times and 2.2 times higher than that for H2 water (p <0.001) and normal cows’ milk (p <0.001), respectively. The AUC value for normal cows’ milk was 2.2 times higher than that for H2 water (p <0.001; Fig. 4b). Breath H2 concentrations following fasting were stable from 3 to 5ppm (Supplementary Fig. 2). Individual changes in breath H2 concentrations are shown in Fig. 4c. Breath H2 concentrations of all volunteers were increased by consumption of H2-producing milk 2. Breath H2 concentrations of a volunteer (Ex2-21) by consumption of H2-producing milk 2 was same as that by the consumption of normal cows’ milk. In all but four volunteers (Exp2-4, Exp2-9, Exp2-13, and Exp2-16), breath H2 concentrations were increased by normal cows’ milk. All H2 concentrations in the breaths of all treated volunteers peaked between 5 and 15min after consumption of H2 water."
14,"Changes in blood glucose level, gastrointestinal discomfort, and breath methane gas","3.4 Changes in blood glucose level, gastrointestinal discomfort, and breath methane gas Because H2-producing milk is a beverage product with added carbohydrates, we also assessed its impact on blood glucose levels. No significant changes in the blood glucose levels of volunteers were observed 90min after consumption of H2-producing milk (Fig. 5 a). In addition, according to survey results, none of the nine volunteers experienced grumbling intestines, a noticeable increase in flatulence, or significant offensive odor in gas as a result of consuming the H2-producing milk (Fig. 5b). Methane gas concentrations in the breaths of volunteers were also measured as part of this study. Methane gas concentrations in breaths were unchanged with the consumption of all test drinks (Fig. 5c)."
15,Discussion,"In this study, we hypothesized that the effective indigestible components may differ among individuals based on individual variations in the intestinal microbiome. This was verified based on the observation that the H2-producing indigestible components differed in each of the 10 fecal samples used in the culturing experiments. This indicates that for some individuals, ingestion of a single dietary fiber did not induce sufficient H2 production. Although FOS is thought to be completely fermented by the intestinal microbiota (Oku & Nakamura, 2014), two fecal samples exhibited insufficient H2 production from FOS, suggesting that there are bacterial metabolic pathways in which H2 is not produced, even if FOS is metabolized. In addition, very little H2 was produced by the addition of insoluble dietary fibers, such as cellulose, pectin, chitin, chitosan, and lignin, indicating that intestinal bacteria produce H2 from soluble indigestible components. We searched for an efficient combination of dietary fiber based on this data and found that a combination of FOS, GOS, and glucomannan, as well as a combination of maltitol, GOS, and glucomannan were effective inducers of H2 gas production in all fecal samples. Because the H2 concentrations in cultured bottles were higher than that of FOS, based on the addition of maltitol, we determined that the most effective combination was maltitol, GOS, and glucomannan. Interestingly, the fecal microbiome of volunteer no. 8 produced H2 only from glucomannan. We consider that a combination of different chemical structures of the indigestible components, such as our H2-producing milk containing a disaccharide (lactose), oligosaccharide (GOS), functional fiber (glucomannan), and sugar alcohol (maltitol), may be important and effective for H2 production by various intestinal microbiomes. Breath H2 concentrations following consumption of H2-producing milk were compared with a previous report; the average peak H2 level after consumption of FOS (5g), which elicited the highest H2 production among dietary fibers, was under 25ppm (Nakamura et al., 2016; Oku & Nakamura, 2014), whereas those of H2-producing milk 1 (each material: 2g) and H2-producing milk 2 (GOS: 3g, maltitol: 2g, and glucomannan: 0.2g) were approximately 35 and 50ppm, respectively. These differences may depend on the high effective rate of H2-producing milk, for which the H2 concentration was obviously increased in 28 out of 30 volunteers. Lactose is not catabolized in the small intestine and must therefore reach the large intestine in people with lactose intolerance, such as Japanese and other Asian individuals. Therefore, it is likely that the large number of people with lactose intolerance (Lomer et al., 2008; Nose et al., 1979) have intestinal microbiomes capable of utilizing lactose to produce H2. Nishijima et al. (2016) showed that Japanese people exhibit a significantly higher proportion of genes in the lactose transport system based on the metagenomic data of feces obtained from 106 Japanese individuals compared with those from 755 individuals from 11 other nations. Many Japanese individuals reporting lactose intolerance carry intestinal bacteria that use lactose as an energy source, suggesting that this phenomenon manifested in tandem with the increased consumption of milk in Japan during the westernization for 70years after World War II. Thus, the potential functions of H2 production following consumption of cows’ milk are still unknown. In fact, similar to a report by Shimouchi et al. (2009), with the exception of six (Exp1-4, Exp1-8, Exp2-4, Exp2-9, Exp2-13, and Exp2-16) out of 30 volunteers (total number of volunteers in Experiments 1 and 2), the H2 concentrations in the breaths of volunteers in this study increased after consumption of regular cows’ milk. In a Japan collaborative cohort study of 94,980 Japanese adults aged 40–79years with no history of cancer, stroke, or chronic cardiovascular diseases conducted between 1988 and 2009, the age-adjusted all-cause mortality rates appeared to decrease with increased frequency of cows’ milk consumption in both men and women compared with that in subjects who never drank milk (Wang et al., 2015). These findings highlighted the potential effects of consumption of normal cows’ milk, induced by lactose-derived H2 production by intestinal bacteria in people with mild lactose intolerance, including Japanese individuals. The effects of H2 produced by intestinal bacteria have been studied in several studies. Kajiya et al. (2009) reported that suppression of intestinal microbiota by antibiotics increased the severity of ConA-induced hepatitis, while reconstitution of intestinal microbiota with H2-producing E. coli, but not H2-deficient mutant E. coli, downregulated ConA-induced liver inflammation. In an animal model of ischemia-reperfusion injury, the results of several studies (Nishimura et al., 2012; Tanabe et al., 2012; Zhai et al., 2013) suggested that increasing intestinal H2 production by administering pectin, resistant starches, or lactulose can result in reduced hepatic oxidative stress and diminished severity of neurological disorders. The results of a study by Nishimura et al. (2013) suggested that increasing the concentration of H2 in the adipose tissues of rats kept on a high-fat diet by administering FOS reduced the concentrations of inflammatory cytokines. In meta-analysis studies, acarbose, an α-glucosidase inhibitor, has been used as a drug for the suppression of postprandial hyperglycemia by inhibiting the digestion of disaccharides and can also suppress the risk of myocardial infarction in patients with type 2 diabetes (Hanefeld et al., 2004). Suzuki et al. (2009) observed that use of acarbose significantly increases H2 concentrations in the breaths of volunteers for 4days. The authors also predicted that use of acarbose would produce more potent effects than H2 water because acarbose can supply H2 to the body for a longer period of time than H2 water. The present study showed that consumption of H2-producing milk resulted in higher peak H2 concentrations in the breath as compared with H2 water. In addition, total H2 production (AUC) was also significantly higher for H2-producing milk compared with that of H2 water, implying that the general effects of H2-producing milk will exceed those of H2 water. We believe that H2-producing milk is probably effective for prevention of diseases caused by oxidative stress. For example, oxidative stress-mediated diseases, including inflammatory diseases, are targets of this product; indeed, many studies have shown the beneficial effects of H2 inhalation or H2 water consumption in disease model rodents and clinical tests (Ichihara et al., 2015). We also expect that this product may have beneficial effects on inflammatory symptoms influenced by the intestinal mucosal immune system because H2 can be provided to the intestinal mucosal immune system at higher quantities and more directly following the consumption of this product than after H2 inhalation and H2 water consumption. Alleviation of oxidative stress caused by daily exercise and training can also be expected. However, it is difficult for H2-producing milk to protect against damage caused by immediate treatments, such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, as reported in many studies (Ichihara et al., 2015), because this product cannot provide H2 to the body reliably on time and during treatment with antibiotics. In previous studies, H2 concentrations in the small intestine, large intestine, cecum, liver, spleen tissues, and blood in mice treated with antibiotics were significantly lower than those in control mice (Kajiya et al., 2009), demonstrating that the H2 produced by intestinal bacteria is transported to each of these organs. However, according to a report by Liu et al. (2014), there is a difference between the different routes of H2 delivery, i.e., oral administration, intraperitoneal, or intravenous administration of H2 water or H2 absorption. Therefore, gathering additional data regarding the systemic distribution of H2 produced as a result of H2-producing milk consumption should be considered in future studies. In contrast, although the consumption of H2 water ameliorated symptoms in a mouse model of Parkinson’s disease, no effects were observed following treatment of mice with lactulose (Ito et al., 2012). Therefore, it is also necessary to test the effects of H2 produced by intestinal bacteria in the context of various disease states in future studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the analysis of intestinal microbiota using next-generation sequencing technology and a detailed investigation of the H2 production capacities of these bacteria. Aguirre, Bussolo de Souza, and Venema (2016) theorized that the presence of Alistipes, which was positively correlated with H2 concentration in the presence of GOS in this study, can contribute to weight loss based on observations of increased relative abundance of Alistipes, in conjunction with increased short-chain fatty acids, as a result of culture experiments involving the addition of dietary fiber (arabinoglucan or inulin) to the feces obtained from lean individuals. This finding supported a positive correlation between the presence of Alistipes and H2 production in our present study because H2 is excreted with short-chain fatty acids by intestinal bacterial carbohydrate metabolism (Fischbach & Sonnenburg, 2011; Flint et al., 2008). Despite the significance of Odoribacter, which was positively correlated with H2 production in the presence of lactose, few reports have described its interaction with dietary fiber additives. Future studies are also needed to determine which bacteria use H2 as an energy source and inhabit the intestinal tract (Maier et al., 2013). Methane gas was not produced by the consumption of H2-producing milk, although H2 was produced. This seemed to depend on the lack of methane-producing Methanobrevibacter, which are less abundant in Japanese individuals (Nishijima et al., 2016). Although we did not detect any bacterial groups that were strongly negatively correlated with H2 production, further studies using more subjects are needed. Lactose is produced by β-1,4-glycosidic bonds between galactose and glucose, GOSs are comprised of glucose molecules bound through the action of the β-galactosidase enzyme, and glucomannan is a molecule comprised of a 2:3 ratio of glucose and mannose joined through β-1,4-glycosidic bonds. These molecules are believed to be degraded via the intestinal microbiome to produce glucose, which may increase blood sugar. However, blood sugar levels did not increase after consumption of H2-producing milk, which can therefore be assumed to present no risk of altering the blood glucose levels of consumers. Cows’ milk, especially whey protein, has strong insulin secretion-promoting and blood glucose-suppressive effects that have been demonstrated in multiple studies involving both healthy individuals and individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (Frid, Nilsson, Holst, & Bjorck, 2005; Gunnerud, Holst, Ostman, & Bjorck, 2012; Mortensen et al., 2012; Nilsson, Stenberg, Frid, Holst, & Bjorck, 2004; Tessari et al., 2007). The results of this clinical study also suggested that consumption of whey protein can help maintain blood glucose levels. These results highlight the important possibility that adding prebiotic components capable of inducing H2 production to milk as a functional beverage product may reduce the risk of blood sugar spikes in those that consume the product. A previous study suggested that consumption of H2 water may also improve glucose metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes (Kajiyama et al., 2008); therefore, it is possible that H2 produced through consumption of H2-producing milk or normal milk may directly maintain blood glucose levels. Moreover, volunteers participating in our study experienced flatulence and gastrointestinal discomfort due to H2 produced in the body, but as these symptoms were mostly “mild”, and only one volunteer reported having a “grumbling intestine”; we believe these side effects were within an acceptable range."
16,Conclusion,"In this study, we first screened a wide variety of indigestible ingredients capable of inducing H2 production in the human intestinal tract, while considering intestinal microbiome diversity between individuals. We also developed a beverage composed of cows’ milk with GOS, maltitol, and glucomannan (H2-producing milk). A clinical trial was conducted to assess the effects of this experimental functional beverage, which confirmed that consumption of H2-producing milk induced higher H2 concentrations in the breath, including higher peak concentrations and persistence for a longer period of time, compared with consumption of H2 water and normal cows’ milk."
