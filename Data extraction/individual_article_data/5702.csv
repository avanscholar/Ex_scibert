0,Introduction,"The presence of hazardous organic compounds and emerging contaminants including organic dyes, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products in water bodies has become a serious concern in recent years [1]. Unfortunately, conventional wastewater treatment technologies such as the activated sludge process are not able to completely remove those categories from water [2]. Pharmaceuticals have been frequently detected in ambient waterways because they can pass unchanged through secondary treatment in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) [3]. Previous investigations have demonstrated that tetracycline (TC) is the second most common antibiotic in human medicine [4,5]. It is excreted via urine and feces of patients at high concentrations to municipal sewage and can lead to harmful toxicological and negative impacts on microbiological aquatic ecosystems. Meanwhile, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), as a highly efficient and environment-friendly oxidant, has attracted much interest owing to its application in wastewater treatment and disinfection processes [6]. It owns the highest amount of active oxygen (47.1 %w/w) with only water as a by-product. Unfortunately, H2O2 is industrially produced via a multistep process of anthraquinone (AQ) oxidation that is high-energy consuming and not environmentally benign. Furthermore, direct synthesis of H2O2 from H2 and O2 in the presence of noble metal catalysts has not yet been scaled up because of the potentially explosive risk of the H2/O2 mixed gases [7]. During the last decade, heterogeneous visible-light-active photocatalytic systems, as a branch of advanced oxidation processes, have received considerable attention owing to their potential usage at ambient operating temperature and pressure, degradation of a wide range of stubborn and non-biodegradable pollutants, and economically reliability [8–11]. Generally, photocatalysts degrade organic compounds by generating reactive oxygen species with strong redox abilities such as hydroxyl radical (•OH) and superoxide radical (•O2 –), H2O2, and holes under light illumination [12–14]. In a similar way, photocatalysis that can directly harvest solar energy to chemical energy has been considered as a sustainable, facile, and energy-saving method for the production of H2O2 with no risk of explosion. Carbon nitride (CN) has emerged as a cheap, visible–light active, and organic semiconductor for many applications from water/air treatments to sustainable energy development [15–18]. Strong stability under harsh conditions, easy preparation from cost-effective precursors (urea, melamine, thiourea, and more), suitable band gap make CN unique from other semiconductors [19–22]. However, the photocatalytic performance of CN is still low, because of the intrinsic moderate light absorption, weak charge separation, and low surface area alongside poor reduction ability [23–25]. One of the principle shortcomings is originated from an uncontrollable solid-state polycondensation process that leads to the sublimation of melamine–based intermediates and gives uncondensed structure of CN. Supramolecular self–assembly has been particularly considered an efficient approach for improvement of the polycondensation process via preventing the sublimation of melamine as the main intermediate [26,27]. Shalom et al. prepared CN with high photoactivity towards the photodegradation of RhB (10 mg L-1 after 105 min) by using a self-assembly of melamine and cyanuric acid [28]. They showed that the thermal polycondensation of the melamine–cyanuric acid complex, as a precursor, gave CN with the enhanced optical and physical properties with nonradiative deactivation pathways. However, one single modification technique can hardly improve both the oxidation and reduction ability of photocatalyst to a great level [29–31]. Because the performance of photocatalysts significantly depends on their valance band (VB) and conduction bond (CB) potentials to induce half-reactions of (•OH/OH–) and (O2/•O2 –), respectively [32–34]. On the other hand, greater visible light harvesting and strong redox potentials are two mutually exclusive goals since the former is limited by a narrower band gap, whereas the latter implies a more negative CB and a more positive VB potential are required [35]. Therefore, exploring additional facile and rational strategies to achieve high efficiency in a short time is also beyond question and more applicable for large-scale utilization. Constructing a Z-scheme heterojunction between CN with another oxidation semiconductor is a great, promising, and rational way to address one single modification approach of CN [15,36]. To aim this approach, the key step is to build a strong and intimate interface between CN with another semiconductor that has well-matched CB and VB edges. After contacting two materials with different work functions, an internal electric field can be built between them. This electric field can effectively accelerate the photogenerated electron-hole pairs and suppresses the exciton recombination [37]. Furthermore, the well–organized composite increases visible light harvesting and presents the strong oxidation and reduction powers for the photogenerated holes and electrons, respectively. To date, heterojunctions with well-matched band edges such as Fe2O3/g-C3N4 [38], TiO2/g–C3N4 [39], and WO3/g–C3N4 [40] have been successfully investigated to tackle two above–mentioned thermodynamic issues. Of these, employing WO3 with interesting characteristics including high stability, visible light activity, more positive VB potential, and more suitable band alignment than CN, is highly intriguing but still single WO3 shows fast charge recombination [41]. For example, WO3/g–C3N4 hollow microspheres were prepared by hydrolysis of Na2WO4 and dicyandiamide in the presence of glucose by hydrothermal and subsequent polycondensation methods [42]. The reported WO3/g–C3N4 showed higher visible–light photocatalytic activity towards the degradation of antibiotics. Despite the successful construct of CN/WO3, it is still far from its possible theoretical value. Because we noted that almost all above studies utilized the traditional polycondensation of melamine [41,43,44], urea [45,46], and dicyandiamide [47] to prepare parent CN, which means fewer heptazine units, more stacking layer, less visible light absorption, and more charge recombination. Despite the fundamental limitations originating from either the intrinsic optical and physical properties of CN’s or WO3′s mentioned above, the geometry configurations of interfaces where they should get along within the contact area are highly challenging. For instance, weak interfaces in some preparation techniques lead to the detachment of small particles from their counterpart during applications, limiting their usage in large–scale recycling [48]. Therefore, in the construction of heterojunctions, the design and engineering of the constituents before and after contact is also critically important and still highly needed to obtain a substantial breakthrough in practical terms. Herein, we successfully prepared a high stable preorganized supramolecular structure of melamine, cyanuric acid, and thiourea (SUP) with a regular rod-like hexagonal morphology. Afterward, a strong and intimate tungsten oxide/carbon nitride heterojunction (W/CN-SUP) was obtained via simple, cost-effective, and facile thermal polycondensation of SUP precursor along with a certain amount of ammonium tungstate(VI). W/CN-SUP showed promising charge separation and unprecedented light harvesting in the solar spectrum. This photocatalyst showed impressive activities for both the photodegradation of organic compounds and H2O2 production under visible light illumination. Based on the liquid chromatography–tandem mass (LC–MS/MS) spectrometry results and intermediates identification, the heterojunction degraded the TC to the intermediate with a higher value of LD50, lower bioaccumulation factor, and negative mutagenicity compared to TC. The trapping experiments were also conducted to investigate the possible dominant reactive species and possible mechanisms."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Cyanuric acid (CY), melamine (ML), thiourea (TU), benzoquinone (BQ), isopropyl alcohol (IPA), triethanolamine (TEOA), rhodamine B (RhB), and terephthalic acid (TA) were purchased from Daejung Chemicals & Metals Co. Ltd. (Gyeonggi–Do, Korea). Tetracycline (TC), ammonium tungstate(VI), and tungsten(IV) sulfide (WS2) were prepared by Sigma–Aldrich Co. and all chemicals were analytical grade when used. Distilled water was used as the solvent for all of the reported experiments."
3,"Preparation of supramolecular based on ML, CY, and TU (SUP)","2.2 Preparation of supramolecular based on ML, CY, and TU (SUP) Recently, the supramolecular strategy has been shown to be an impressive method for promoting the polycondensation process of carbon nitride materials and providing efficient charge carriers centers. This inspired us to use new collaborations based on the supramolecular strategy to prepare parent CN. TU was chosen as the third moiety to steer the typical melamine–cyanuric acid complex, since TU has been reported to act as a template to pre-orient olefins [49,50]. The equal mass amounts of precursors, i.e., ML, CY, and TU at (3:3:3) were individually transferred into boiling water to obtain more transparency. Then, the three solutions were mixed in Teflon–lined autoclave reactors under stirring for 30 min, and left in the oven at 100 °C for 4 h. After natural cooling, the precipitations were centrifuged, and dried at 80 °C in the oven overnight."
4,Preparation of carbon nitride (CN),"2.3 Preparation of carbon nitride (CN) SUP (2.5 g) was loaded into a crucible with lid, and tempered at 540 °C for 3 h under air atmosphere with a heating rate of 3.0 °C min−1, and kept at this temperature for 30 min. The resulting sample did not need further to grind, and was named CN–SUP. A control sample was also synthesized by the pyrolysis of melamine (CN–ML) as a starting material in the same way, to investigate the optical, textural, and other property deviations of the CN–SUP"
5,Synthesis of in situ supramolecular–assisted heterojunctions,"2.4 Synthesis of in situ supramolecular–assisted heterojunctions The as-prepared SUP powder of 2.5 g was dispersed in 100 mL of water by intense sonication for 10 min, and then kept under a sonication bath for 1 h. The initial amount of SUP critically affects the final product. Then, metal sources (ammonium tungstate(VI)) with given amounts of 0.005, 0.01, and 0.2 g were added into the suspension of SUP under vigorous stirring for 15 min. Subsequently, the mixture was strongly sonicated for 10 min, and was taken out into an ultrasonication bath to obtain well–dispersed metal ions within SUP particles. The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature (RT), to stabilize metal ions adsorbed on the SUP surface. The product was dried at 80 °C for 24 h, and grounded in a mortar to obtain uniformity. Next, the solid was loaded into the crucible with a lid, and tempered at 540 °C for 3 h at a heating ramp of 3.0 °C min−1. Under air atmosphere, metal ions and SUP were gradually converted to intimate heterojunction where metal ions intercalated (W/CN–SUP). The products were washed and centrifuged to dissolve the unreacted ions, and were finally dried in air at 80 °C overnight. Scheme 1 shows a schematic of the synthesis pathway of W/CN–SUP."
6,Synthesis references for W/CN–SUP heterojunction,"2.5 Synthesis references for W/CN–SUP heterojunction To fabricate accurate references, two common techniques of impregnation (imp–W/CN–SUP) and physical mixing–thermal treatment (phy@th–W/CN–SUP) were used to study the interfaces in detail. To further refine the references to the best material, the same carbon nitride resulted from SUP was used, instead of using typical bulk carbon nitride. To synthesize imp–W/CN–SUP, 0.22 g of CN–SUP was dispersed in 100 mL of water by sonication process, as described in the previous section. Then, a series of ammonium tungstate of 0.005, 0.01, and 0.05 g was added into the CN–SUP solution, and sonicated for 1 h. The mixture was stirred at 70 °C overnight,to evaporate the water. The gathered material was transferred to a crucible, and heated to 540 °C for 3 h at a heating ramp of 3.0 °C min−1. Note that the primary experiments were conducted to successfully achieve the best mass ratio. For example, the overloading of metal source, less amount of CN–SUP, or harsh temperature condition leads to the sublimation of CN–SUP. To fabricate the phy@th–W/CN–SUP, WO3 particles were first synthesized via the calcination of WS2 at 540 °C for 4 h. Then, different concentrations of WO3 in the water of 2.5, 5, and 7.5 g L-1 were prepared, which is referred to as solution 1. Solution 2 includes 0.4 g of CN–SUP dispersed in 10 mL water under the sonication procedure. Afterwards, solution 1 was poured into solution 2 and stirred for 30 min, followed by sample sonication for 24 h, to give a homogeneous suspension. The suspension was separated by centrifuging, and dried at 80 °C for 8 h. Then the powder was transferred into a furnace under 500 °C for 3 h at a ramp rate of 2.5 °C min−1, to provide as strong as possible contact between the components."
7,Characterization,"2.6 Characterization The crystalline structure of samples was assessed by X–ray powder diffraction (XRD) on a Bruker, D8 ADVANCE with monochromatic Cu–Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) in the 2θ range (10–80)° at RT. The morphology of samples was performed by field–emission scanning electron microscopy (FE–SEM), FEI Nova NanoSEM with Schottky–type thermal FE gun operating at 15 kV. X–ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were made by Thermo Fisher Scientific, ESCALAB 250XI X–ray photoelectron spectrometry using monochromated Al–Kα source with an energy step size of 1.0 eV under an ultrahigh vacuum of 1.0 × 10–10 Torr. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging was conducted on a JEOL, JEM–2100F with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a Q500 apparatus. Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry was conducted using a 1200 Series & HCT basic system from 50 to 3,000 m/z. The photoluminescence spectra (PL) were recorded by Edinburgh Instrument, NF900 (FLS920) spectrophotometry in the range 200–800 nm. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were provided on a Micromeritics Instruments, ASAP2020 instrument, and before measurements, all samples were degassed at 150 °C for 3 h. From the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) equations, the specific surface area, and the pore size distributions were extracted, respectively. UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were taken by Agilent, Cary 5000 spectrophotometry, employing BaSO4 as the reference. The band gap was estimated through Kubelka–Munk theory as shown in Eq. (1), and employed Tauc plot, i.e., (F(R)hν)n against (hν). Accordingly, F(R), R∞, h, and ν are the Kubelka–Munk function, reflectance of a layer, Planck constant, and frequency of radiation, respectively. The n value was taken as 0.5 and 2 for the indirect allowed and direct allowed transitions of a semiconductor. The band gap energy (Eg) was calculated from the extrapolation of the linear section of the spectra to the hν axis. (1) ( 1 - R ) 2 2 × R ∞ = F ( R )"
8,Electrochemical measurements,"2.7 Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical analysis measurements were done in a three-electrode cell on a potentiostat (Versa STAT, Princeton Applied Research) system, using a Pt wire electrode as the counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode, respectively. Na2SO4 aqueous solution (0.5 M) was used as an electrolyte, and the working electrode was prepared as below: 5 mg of the photocatalyst was dispersed in 1 mL of ethanol, and then 100 µL of Nafion solution (5.0 wt%) was added. The mixture was sonicated for 30 min to give a homogenous suspension. A given amount of the slurry was dropped on a 1.0 cm × 1.0 cm Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate by spin coating technique and kept under air to be dried. The electrode was annealed at a rising temperature from 25 to 250 °C for 1 h. A 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a water filter was used as a photoexcitation light source. The electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) was conducted at the amplitude of 5 mV and frequency range 10-1 – 105 Hz. All results vs. Ag/AgCl were converted to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) base on the Nernst equation at RT, according to Eq. (2): (2) E RHE = E AgCl + E AgCl 0"
9,Photocatalytic activity tests,"2.8 Photocatalytic activity tests 2.8.1 Photodegradation Firstly, the photocatalytic capacity of the prepared materials was investigated by the photocatalytic degradation of RhB as a common reference and industrial pollutant. We also monitored the photocatalytic performance of samples by the photodegradation of TC, since RhB may act as a photosensitizer in the visible light region. The photocatalyst powder was dispersed by sonication in 20 mL of pollutant solution (12 mg L–1). Before irradiation, the Pyrex vessel was kept in dark conditions for 60 min, to reach absorption–desorption equilibrium. The vessel was placed at 10 cm from a 300 W Xe lamp with a 400 nm cutoff filter. At given times, 2.5 mL of sample was taken, and the concentration was measured by UV–vis spectrophotometry. Note that RhB has one prominent absorptionpeak at λmax = 553 nm, whereas TC shows two obvious peaks at λmax = 273 and 356 nm. The photoactivity calculation was done usingEq. (3), where, η, C0, and Ct are the photocatalytic efficiency, initial concentration before illumination, and concentration after illumination time, respectively. Moreover, the degradation results were well fitted by the first–order reaction kinetics model, as shown in Eq. (4). (3) η = ( C 0 - C t ) C 0 (4) ln C 0 C t = k app × t 2.8.2 Production of H2O2 The photocatalytic production of H2O2 was performed by adding a certain amount of photocatalyst (10 mg) to a water/EtOH mixture (19/1 v/v, 20 mL). The catalyst was well dispersed by ultrasonication for 5 min and was sealed with a rubber septum. The mixture was bubbled with oxygen for 15 min to obtain an oxygen-saturated suspension followed by stirring for 15 min in the dark to reach the absorption–desorption equilibrium. The mixture vessel was exposed to visible light irradiation provided by a 300 W Xe lamp with a 400 nm cutoff filter. Under illumination, 1 mL solution was withdrawn every 15 min and the catalyst separated with a filter (0.45 μm). The decomposition behavior of H2O2 over prepared photocatalysts was also investigated by adding the sample to an H2O2 solution with 200 μM initial concentration and then irradiated under visible light for 60 min with continuous stirring. The H2O2 concentration in the solution was determined by an iodometric method. In detail, 0.05 mL of 0.01 mol L–1 ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate aqueous solution and 2 mL of 0.1 mol L–1 potassium iodide aqueous solution were added to 1 mL supernatant, and kept for 30 min. The H2O2 molecules reacted with iodide anions (I–) to generate triiodide anions (I3 –). The amount of I3 – was determined by UV–vis spectroscopy on the basis of the absorbance at 350 nm, from which the concentration of H2O2 was calculated by the calibration curve."
10,Detection of active species by trapping experiments,"2.9 Detection of active species by trapping experiments Scavenging experiments were used to further study the effect of active species on performance. 100 µL of IPA, BQ, and TEOA solutions with a concentration of 10 mM were added into the parent solution (photocatalyst plus contaminant), and were illuminated. IPA, BQ, and TEOA act as hydroxyl radical (•OH), superoxide radical (•O2 –), and hole (h+) capture, respectively."
11,Results and discussion,
12,Chemical structure and morphology of supramolecular precursor,"3.1 Chemical structure and morphology of supramolecular precursor The supramolecular aggregates are obtained by mixing equal mass ratios of TU, ML, and CY (3:3:3) in water as a green solvent. As seen from SEM image, SUP exhibits a regular six-sided face which confirms that the presence of TU molecules provides regular orientations for other members ( Fig. S1 a & b of the Supporting Information (SI)). Based on FT-IR results, SUP indicates a prominent difference in the spectrum compared to bare CY, ML, TU which result from the formation of hydrogen bonds between them ( Fig. S1 c of SI). Obviously, new and more prominent peaks can appear in the region of 1357 to 1813 cm−1 which confirms the new interactions within the SUP complex. It is also well documented that CY molecules are connected with ML molecules via hydrogen bonds of N-H…O and N-H…N, and this cusses a blue-shift of C = O stretching vibration in CY and red-shift of triazine ring vibrations in ML [28,51,52]. In our sample, the peak C = O is shifted from 1692 to 1735 cm−1 while the peak at 810 appears at 765 cm−1 as shown in Fig. S1 c of SI. Further, the FT-IR results belonged to the sulfur region are magnified in Fig. S1 d of SI. As seen, the solid-state of TU molecules shows C = S stretching vibration at 1084 cm−1 while there is no similar peak for ML and CY in this region [53]. More interestingly, the C = S shows a bit shifting to a higher frequency which is reasonably considered non-covalent interactions of thiourea with neighbor’s atoms. The XRD results from a combination of ML, CY, and TU and resulting SUP are given in Fig. S2 of SI. It shows the new directionality, which is confirmed by the presence of new and prominent peaks at around 10.8, 11.8, 21.9, 28.1, and 33.2°. More importantly, a close look at Fig. S2 of SI given all pivotal diffraction patterns of ML, CY, and TU, are disappeared in the reborn SUP structure, indicating successfully self-assembly and new orientation of ML, CY, and TU monomers. As a result, it is suggested that TU is possibly mediated between melamine-cyanuric acid complexes, giving a regular rod–like hexagonal shape ( Fig. S1 e of SI)."
13,Chemical structure and morphology of CN,"3.2 Chemical structure and morphology of CN Fig. 1 a shows the XRD diffraction pattern of the main photocatalyst, i.e., W/CN–SUP along with control samples. The typical CN–ML shows one intense peak at 27.4° (002), and a weaker one at 13.1° (100), which belong to the interlayer stacking of heptazine units and in-plane packing nitrogen motif (nitrogen pots) [54,55]. The remarkable decrease in plane of (002) for CN–SUP arises from the reduced stacking layers along the c-axis, and moving from the bulk structure to the nanostructure domain [23]. In addition, these changes in physical structure affect the nitrogen pots, as evidenced by a new deviation of the (100) plan. The XRD peaks of CN and WO3 nanoparticles with (002), (020), and (022) planes appear in the W/CN–SUP photocatalyst [56,57], indicating the successful growth of tungsten nanoparticles and supramolecular self-assembly at the same time. These results suggest that tight combination occurs via the in situ synthesis of constituents. This might also assure the interfacial contact between WO3 and CN, and provides more opportunity for the accelerated charge transfer [42]. Notably, tungsten nanoparticles are not able to overgrow on the CN surface, which is evidenced by weak XRD patterns, because the supramolecular complex can have a confinement effect for tungsten ions. The accurate amount of optimized WO3 in the composite is determined by TGA, which is 6.2 wt% ( Fig. S3 a of the SI). FE–SEM was employed to investigate the transformation of SUP precursor to CN and consequently the formation of W/CN-SUP heterojunction. Fig. 1 shows the FE-SEM images of W/CN–SUP, CN–SUP, and CN–ML. In contrast to the typical CN–ML, CN–SUP shows curly sheet–like nanostructures with small particle size and thickness, which are prone to be an excellent substrate for WO3 nanoparticles (Fig. 1 c). More importantly, the particle size and thickness of CN in W/CN–SUP is decreased in the presence of WO3 nanoparticles, as illustrated in the high-magnification image (Fig.s 1d & e). Moreover, Fig. 1 e clearly shows the curly nanosheets in CN-SUP have changed to a flatter 2D nanosheet in the W/CN–SUP sample. It shows the surface tension is significantly decreased in the presence of WO3 nanoparticles and may provide more surface active sites. Moreover, the formation of nanosheets with small thickness, in turn, promotes the transition of charge carriers throughout the structure due to a short diffusion length and endows many active sites for the surface reactions. The AFM results show the ultrathin thickness of CN in the composite of W/CN–SUP, which is mostly around 4 nm with a small particle size (Fig.s 1f & g). The particle size of WO3 on the CN–SUP is very small, so that it cannot be recognized therein by SEM image. In this sense, elemental mapping images of W/CN–SUP confirm the uniform distribution of W, as well as the C, N, and O elements (Fig. 1 h). Moreover, the EDX spectrum indicates the presence of the mentioned elements in the composite ( Fig. S3 b of the SI). The chemical structure of W/CN–SUP and others reference samples were further studied by the XPS technique in detail (Fig. 2 ). The high–resolution XPS spectrum of C1s reveals two peaks at binding energies of 284.8 and 288.1 eV, corresponding to adventitious carbon and N–C = N bonds, respectively [58,59]. The ratio of N–C = N to C–C increases from 2.03 to 12.08, as shown in Table 1 , confirming the polycondensation improvement of tri–s–triazine in the CN–SUP and W/CN–SUP. The high–resolution XPS spectrum of N1s for CN–ML is deconvoluted into three peaks located at 398.6, 399.6, and 401.2 eV, relating to C–N = C, N–(C)3, and –N–H pending group, respectively [60,61]. Interestingly, Fig. 2 b shows that the ratio of C–N = C to N–(C)3 obviously increases in the order W/CN–SUP (7.91) > CN–SUP (5.62) > CN–ML (1.21). This increase suggests greater condensation of heptazine units, and improves the polycondensation process, since the ratio of C/N for all samples is approximately the same. The XPS peaks associated with C–N = C and N–(C)3 in CN–SUP indicate a slight blue shift, compared with CN–ML. Furthermore, this positive shift is more prominent in the case of W/CN–SUP, indicating the electron density is decreased around N–(C)3 groups (inset arrow in Fig. 2 b). This phenomenon can result from highly condensed CN nanosheets which are in line with further increasing the ratio of C–N = C to N–(C)3. Since there are more nitrogen atoms around the N–(C)3 site, more electrons withdraw from the N–(C)3, and consequently, positive movement occurs. The O1s high–resolution XPS spectra of W/CN–SUP show an asymmetric peak, which could be deconvoluted into two peaks at 530.1 and 532.1 eV ( Fig. S4 a of the SI). The former belongs to the lattice oxygen atoms in W–O–W bonds, whereas the latter is assigned to physically adsorbed oxygen [46]. Notably, a slight negative shift is also observed in the oxygen region of WO3 in the case of W/CN–SUP, which is consistent with a similar negative shift in the W4f high–resolution XPS spectra ( Fig. S4 b of the SI). This means that a strong interface contact occurs by the in situ growth of carbon nitride and tungsten nanoparticles. As a result, this suggests that the in situ supramolecular–assisted W/CN–SUP heterojunction not only provides strong interface contact, but also modifies the polycondensation process, and presents more heptazine units that act as the light-harvesting antenna."
14,Texture properties,"3.3 Texture properties Nitrogen adsorption–desorption analysis is used to further investigate the texture properties of W/CN–SUP, CN–SUP, and CN–ML (Fig. 2 c). All isotherms demonstrate mesoporous texture for the samples with the hysteresis loop of H3-type, which means there is no plateau at high P/P0 values. This can be resulted from slit-shaped pores, originating from the aggregation of layers. Furthermore, a great nitrogen uptake at high P/P0 (0.9 < P/P0 < 1) corresponds to the existence of large mesopores and macropores as seen in the pore size distribution plots (inset in Fig. 2 c). Surface areas and pore volumes of the CN-ML, CN–SUP, and W/CN–SUP are measured to be 9.5, 91.1, 132.1 m2 g−1, and 0.045, 0.26, and 0.61 cm3 g−1, respectively (Table 1). As expected, the modification of the polycondensation process via a simple, facile, and cost–effective approach by taking advantage of preorganized supramolecular structure clearly enhances the texture properties of carbon nitride material. What is more, the specific surface area and pore volume of the W/CN–SUP nanostructure is about 13.9 and 13.5 times greater than those of the CN-ML, respectively. It demonstrates the in situ growth of WO3 nanoparticles within CN can provide a new tunnel path and more exfoliation of CN nanosheets. Hence, the synergistic effect of polycondensation and interface engineering leads to a nanostructure with intriguing textural features. Such a great nanoarchitecture provides plenty of available pores for target molecules and also improves light-capturing through multiple scattering effects [62,63]."
15,Optical and photoelectrochemical properties,"3.4 Optical and photoelectrochemical properties The optical properties and band gaps of samples were revealed by DRS measurements and Kubelka–Munk plots, respectively ( Fig. S5 of the SI & Table 1). The CN-ML shows a typical absorption edge around 450 nm which is corresponded to a band gap around 2.7 eV (Fig. 2 d). The absorption edge in CN-SUP clearly moves to smaller wavelengths compared with CN-ML while showing more intensity. It obviously confirms the polycondensation improvement leads to enhancing the optical properties. The blue shift in the DRS plot is also related to the quantum confinement effect, manifesting the decrease of the particle size [23]. Interestingly, Fig. 2 d shows that an unprecedented light–harvesting is observed for W/CN–SUP in the whole spectrum from 200 to 800 nm, compared to CN–ML, and CN-SUP. One reason might be the high surface area and pore volume, giving multiple reflections in the structure [64]. On the other hand, more heptazine building blocks, which are confirmed by the XPS results, present more absorbance antenna and electron transitions, consequently promotes the light absorbance ability of W/CN–SUP. Despite the color change in the powder from yellow to white and the quantum confinement effect, W/CN–SUP reveals a slight red shift in band gap (2.92 eV), indicating the key role of WO3 and the tight interface built between the WO3 nanoparticles and CN nanosheets. PL is a reliable method to study the charge transfer on the photocatalyst surface, specifically recombination of electron-hole pairs. As seen from Fig. 3 a, the CN–SUP synthesized by the supramolecular self–assembly shows remarkably reduced intensity of PL compared to CN–ML, suggesting the efficient separation of excitons. More condensed tri–s–triazine units drive more delocalized electrons, and depress the recombination of electron–hole pairs. In the case of W/CN–SUP, a slight decrease in the PL intensity is still observed in the PL intensity. The charge separation process is followed by transient photocurrent, as well as electrochemical impedance. As seen from the chronoamperometry, significant jumping is seen in the current as soon as the light encounters the CN–SUP electrode, and then a quick drop occurs without the light (Fig. 3 b). This result is completely compatible with the small semicircle of the Nyquist plot compared to CN–ML (Fig. 3 c). This means that the charge–transfer resistance in the double layer dramatically decreases, which results from the textural and structural improvement of carbon nitride based on a new precursor. Interestingly, the impressive current is achieved for W/CN–SUP compared to the others, manifesting strong charge transition and less resistance within the heterojunction. This improved charge transition indicates the synergy effect of ultrathin CN nanosheets and WO3 nanoparticles indeed decreases the diffusion length of charge carriers in different directions and provides new channels for mass transfer. Further, the electron mobility and charge transport ability corresponding to the charge recombination was investigated from the Mott–Schottky plot as shown in Fig. 3 d [65]. Two important factors of donor concentration and flat band potential can be estimated by using Motte–Schottky equation after constructing a strong interface between WO3 and CN-SUP (Eq. (5)). (5) 1 C 2 = 2 ε ε 0 A 2 e N D V - V fb - K B T e Where C is the surface charge capacitance (F cm−2), ε and ε0 are the dielectric constants of the semiconductor (4.6 for g-C3N4) and the vacuum permittivity (8.85 × 10-14F cm−2), respectively, e is the electron charge (1.60 × 10-19C), ND is the donor concentration per unit volume (cm3), V and Vfb are the applied potential at the electrode and the flat band potential (V), respectively, and k is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10−23 J K−1). The positive slops of all the films exhibit an n-type behavior, reflecting that electrons served as the majority carriers in CN-ML, CN-SUP, and W/CN-SUP heterojunction. Moreover, ND and Vfb (vs. Ag/AgCl) were calculated from the slope and the intercept on the potential axis of the Mott-Schottky plot, respectively. The Vfb values of CN-ML, WO3, CN-SUP, and W/CN-SUP were determined to be −0.89, −0.53, −1.02, and −0.64 V (vs. NHE). It is well-known that the flat bond position in n-type homogenous semiconductors is located a bit more positive than conduction bond maximum. The ND values for CN-ML, CN-SUP, and W/CN-SUP films were 3.3 × 1022, 4.1 × 1022, and 4.6 × 1022 cm3 as listed in Table 1. The higher ND value of CN-SUP film shows that the formation of CN by using supramolecular precursor obviously improves the number of charge carriers. Further, the tight interface between WO3 and CN-SUP leads to a bigger electron density per unit of electrode area in the W/CN-SUP film. It is well documented that when the semiconductor is brought into contact with the electrolyte, space charge regions (Wsc) appears because of the electron movement. Wsc can be calculated based on Poisson’s equation according to Eq. (6), depending on ND and Vfb [66]. (6) W SC = 2 ε ε 0 ( V - V fb ) e N D As seen from Table 1, W/CN-SUP film exhibits the narrowest Wsc (12.61 nm) compared to CN-SUP (15.02 nm), and CN-ML (16.14 nm), manifesting fast and efficient charge separation and consequently photocurrent density enhancement. The higher amount of donor concentration and the narrower value of space charge region in W/CN-SUP can result from two main reasons. First, using supramolecular precursor, in turn, gives CN with highly condensed heptazine units with more degree of π electron delocalization which provide plenty of visible light antenna. Second, the contact area between WO3 nanoparticles and CN nanosheet with high surface area leads to accelerating the interfacial charge transitions with shorter diffusion length. The VB XPS results also estimate the relative position of the VB edges ( Fig. S6 of the SI). Fig. 3 e shows the band alignments of W/CN–SUP, CN–SUP, and CN–ML by taking advantage of the Mott–Schottky plot and Tauc results. Hence, the CB levels of CN-ML, WO3, and CN-SUP were −0.89, −0.53, and −1.02 (vs. NHE), while their corresponding band gaps were 2.69, 2.77, and 2.94 eV respectively. The CB values of CN-ML, WO3, and CN-SUP were estimated to be 1.80, 2.24, and 1.92 V (vs. NHE). The sample of CN–SUP reveals a downward shift (0.12 eV) and upward shift (0.13 eV) in the VB and CB edges, respectively, compared to CN-ML, so the band gap increases to 2.94 eV. This band alignment is able to provide more driving force for electrons on the CB, and holes on the VB levels. Furthermore, the band alignment can be also estimated by using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) analysis for CN-SUP, WO3, and W/CN-SUP using HeI emission (hv = 21.22 eV) as a light source ( Fig. S7 of the SI). The relationship between the incident photon energy (hv), secondary electron cut-off (Ecut-off), and work function (Φ) is expressed by Φ = hv – (Ecut-off) [67]. The calculated Φ of WO3, CN–SUP, and W/CN–SUP were 3.7, 3.3 and 3.6 eV (E vs. Evacuum), respectively. Hence, the complementary band energy levels alignment relative to the vacuum energy level was also graphed in Fig. 3 f."
16,Role of interface in charge transition,"3.5 Role of interface in charge transition To further elucidate the effect of interface contacts on the optical and charge transfer properties, two other different methods were applied to prepare tungsten nanoparticles anchored on the carbon nitride: (i) physical mixing–thermal treatment (phy@th–W/CN–SUP), and (ii) impregnation technique (imp–W/CN–SUP). To deepen understanding of the interface contact and provide control samples that appear more reliable, the modified carbon nitride was used (CN–SUP), instead of the bulk CN–ML. Moreover, the best mass ratio of WO3 to CN was considered. The precise amount of WO3 nanoparticle for phy@th–W/CN–SUP and imp–W/CN–SUP is 5.8 and 4.1 wt% based on the TGA results, respectively ( Fig. S8 of the SI). TEM imagery of the CN–ML with high contrast indicates the infinite degree of stacked units (Fig. 4 a). In contrast, the CN–SUP shows an ultrathin nanosheet with weak contrast, indicating supramolecular–assisted technique impressively decreases the stacking layers of carbon nitride (Fig. 4 b). A low–magnification TEM image of W/CN–SUP shows small nanoparticles of WO3 attached to the ultrathin nanosheet of CN–SUP (white arrows), strengthening the hypothesis that before coming into contact with each other, CN and WO3 particles are modified. The high–resolution TEM image at the scale of 100 nm reveals that well–dispersed WO3 nanoparticles consist of ~ 20 nm nanocrystals (Fig. 4 c). With more focusing to 10 nm, high crystallinity and well–ordered WO3 are clearly observed, which is consistent with the XRD patterns (Fig. 4 d). The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED)pattern of W/CN–SUP illustrates two regions of bright contrast spots, as well as several diffuse rings, strongly suggesting high crystallinity and amorphous domain in this contact area (inset of Fig. 4 e). Interestingly, the TEM image of imp–W/CN–SUP shows a weak distribution of WO3 nanoparticles with larger particle size, despite using the sonication approach, compared to that of W/CN–SUP (white circles in Fig. 4 f). Moreover, the HRTEM image from the contact area obviously confirms the low crystallinity of WO3 nanoparticles, which is in agreement with its SAED pattern with a few bright contrast spots (inset in Fig. 4 g). As a result, in this case, tungsten nanoparticles cannot grow on the CN–SUP surface. Similar results are observed for the phy@th–W/CN–SUP, in which a larger particle size of WO3 is distributed on the CN–SUP (Fig. 4 h). To elucidate the role of lattice spacing, HRTEM images were further analyzed via fast Fourier transform (FFT) in detail, by using the spot mask. The W/CN–SUP with the highest crystallinity reveals the lattice spacing of 0.36 nm in the long direction, which corresponds well with the crystal plane of (200) in the monoclinic system ( Fig. S9 of the SI) [56,68]. Meanwhile, the phy@th–W/CN–SUP with less crystallinity shows the crystal plane of (200) in the above system with lattice spacing of 0.36 ( Fig. S10 of the SI). In contrast, the interplanar distance of 0.26 is observed for the sample of imp–W/CN–SUP that is indexed to the crystal plane of (220) ( Fig. S11 of the SI) [68]. As a result, the in situ technique gives smaller, well–distributed, and high crystallinity WO3 nanoparticles attached to the CN nanosheet through the (200) face, whereas the impregnation approach presents WO3 nanoparticles with less crystallinity anchored onto the CN nanosheet via the (220) face. Interestingly, all the heterojunctions reveal similar nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms, as well as textural properties ( Fig. S12 a of the SI). The imp–W/CN–SUP sample shows a pore volume of 0.53 cm3g−1 and surface area of 146 m2g−1, while the phy@th–W/CN–SUP shows a pore volume of 0.51 cm3g−1 and surface area of 123 m2 g−1. Based on the textural and interface results, the intimate interface plays a crucial role in charge carrier transfer. To further strengthen this hypothesis, the optical and electronic features of the heterojunctions were also studied. However, the three heterojunctions exhibit excellent absorbance abilities in the whole spectrum; nevertheless, the W/CN–SUP endows remarkable improvement from 200 to 800 nm over that of the imp–W/CN–SUP and phy@th–W/CN–SUP heterojunctions ( Fig. S12 b of the SI). Interestingly, no change happens to the band gap of 2.92 eV based on the Kubelka–Munk plots ( Fig. S12 c of the SI). The charge career transitions of the W/CN–SUP, imp–W/CN–SUP, and phy@th–W/CN–SUP heterojunctions were analyzed by chronoamperometry technique. Surprisingly, the W/CN–SUP electrode gives significant current density compared with the other two heterojunctions, manifesting that the in situ growth of WO3 and CN during thermal polycondensation modifies them extraordinarily before contact, and presents a strong interface area for charge transition ( Fig. S12 d of the SI). This result is completely compatible with the lowest PL intensity of W/CN–SUP, as compared to the other control samples ( Fig. S12 e of the SI). Having all data in hand, these results confirms the superior improvement of W/CN–SUP heterojunction in terms of the textural, optical, and photocatalytic activity by the novel in situ supramolecular–assisted approach."
17,Photocatalytic activity,"3.6 Photocatalytic activity 3.6.1 Photodegradation of organic compounds The photodegradation of RhB as a common and comparable pollutant was considered to assess the initial activity of the prepared photocatalysts. No RhB degradation is observed without photocatalyst under visible light irradiation, confirming RhB dye is very persistent without using photocatalyst. It is noteworthy that a sample of CN was prepared by calcination of the melamine-cyanuric acid complex (CN-CM) at the same conditions as CN-SUP. The performance of photocatalysts was evaluated toward degradation of RhB (12 mg L-1) within 25 min. the results showed that the degradation rate of RhB over the CN-SUP is much higher than CN-CM ( Fig. S13 of the SI). As shown in Fig. 5 a, the W/CN–SUP shows extraordinary absorbance and activity toward the photodegradation of RhB (12 mg L–1), even compared to the carbon nitride modified with supramolecular strategy, i.e., CN–SUP. It is interesting to note that around 70 % of RhB is absorbed by the W/CN–SUP photocatalyst in 15 min under dark conditions (Fig. 5 a). By extending the time to 60 min to make sure of the adsorption–desorption equilibrium, CN–SUP also shows high adsorption capacity towards RhB (44 %). The reaction rate constant (k) for W/CN–SUP, CN–SUP, and CN–ML is 0.453, 0.0384, and 0.010 min−1, respectively (Fig. 5 c). This means that the k value on W/CN–SUP is 45.3 and 11.8 times higher than that of the CN–ML and CN–SUP photocatalysts, respectively, which is considered as evidence of the extreme activities by loading tungsten trioxide into carbon nitride. These results disclose the excellent architecture on both sides of the WO3 nanoparticles and CN nanosheets that causes a tight interface between them, and consequently, strong absorption ability in the whole range of the spectrum of 200–800 nm. Fig. S14 of the SI shows the time-dependent UV–vis absorption spectra of the photodegradation process. For more confirmation, five bandpass filters of 400, 420, 435, 495, and 550 nm were used to investigate the visible light ability of the W/CN–SUP heterojunction ( Fig. S15 of the SI). None of the bandpass filters can stop the photodegradation of RhB by the W/CN–SUP heterojunction, confirming the precise relationship between the DRS results and the performance under visible light irradiation. Furthermore, a concentrated solution of TC (12 mg L–1) is also selected as a pharmaceutical pollutant, to monitor the photodegradation because it does not have the visible–light response or visible–light photosensitized effect. It is noteworthy that TC is considered a stable structure, and its photolysis after visible light irradiation is insignificant. Remarkably, the W/CN–SUP heterojunction degrades more than 80 % of TC after 15 min under visible light irradiation (Fig. 5 b). The k value of W/CN–SUP is 2.2 and 6.7 times more than those of the CN–SUP, and CN–ML samples, respectively (Fig. 5 d). Furthermore, Table S1 summarizes the results of recent works on WO3/g–C3N4 heterojunctions. It demonstrates that the present W/CN–SUP photocatalyst was degraded both TC and RhB more efficiently in a shorter time with the highest rate constant. The reasons behind this can be resulted from in situ supramolecular–assisted approach and the intimate interface between ultrathin CN and WO3 nanoparticles. The ultrathin W/CN–SUP nanocomposite can provide plenty of surface active sites with shorter diffusion length for electron-hole pairs whereas WO3 nanoparticles extend visible light absorption. It is noteworthy that the W/CN–SUP composite is used in eight consecutive runs for the degradation of RhB (Fig. 5 e). The photoactivity was quite stable even after mechanical treatment, such as washing, centrifuging, and drying steps. No significant change was observed in the XRD pattern, illustrating the preservation of structure after the eight repeated experiments ( Fig. S16 of the SI). The high stability and reusability approve the in situ supramolecular–assisted approach lead to the intercalation of WO3 nanoparticle during the polycondensation of supramolecular complex, confirming the strong contact area between the CN and WO3. Scavenger experiments were also conducted to investigate the impacts of reactive species on the degradation of both TC and RhB. As shown in Fig. 5 f, the photocatalytic efficiency of the W/CN–SUP composite decreased to 58.6%, 89.1%, and 85.5% following the addition of BQ, TEOA, and IPA, respectively. These results demonstrated that •O2 – played a pivotal role in the photocatalytic degradation of RhB whereas photogenerated holes and •OH do not have the primary role in the degradation. Conversely, the photodegradation of TC obviously depressed to 25.1%, 44.1%, and 59.3% in the presence of BQ, TEOA, and IPA, respectively, confirming the significant role of •O2 –, •OH, and holes in the degradation process. This strongly indicates W/CN–SUP photocatalyst is thermodynamically able to generate both strong oxidizing and reducing species. 3.6.2 Production of H2O2 Since H2O2 has been listed a one of the 100 most important chemicals with wide applications [7], specifically in wastewater treatment and environmental remediation [69], the photocatalytic production of H2O2 was also studied on the prepared samples under visible light irradiation. The time-dependent H2O2 concentration over W/CN–SUP, CN-SUP, and CN-ML are displayed in Fig. 6 a. It is noted that the H2O2 hardly can be detected in the absence of either photocatalyst or light irradiation (not shown). Obviously, the amount of the resultant H2O2 on CN-SUP is 91 μmol L-1 compared to that in CN-ML (65 μmol L-1), uncovering supramolecular precursors approach modifies the polycondensation process and improves the photocatalytic performance of CN. Of particular note is that in the presence of WO3 nanoparticles, the amount of H2O2 reaches as high as 161 μmol L-1 (322 μmol g-1h−1) over W/CN–SUP, demonstrating that dual polycondensation and interface engineering can literally enhance the H2O2 production process. It is well documented that H2O2 molecules can be further attacked by photogenerated charge carriers or light and generate other reactive oxygen species such as •OH or even H2O. For instance, activation of H2O2 to •OH by ultraviolet light has been scaled up [69]. Hence, the continual yield of H2O2 is limited by its decomposition. The photocatalytic decomposition of H2O2 over W/CN–SUP, CN-SUP, and CN-ML are shown in Fig. 6 b. The formation and decomposition of H2O2 can be assessed by zero-order and first-order kinetics, respectively. Therefore, the concentration of H2O2 can be calculated by Eq. (7), where kf (μmol L-1 min−1) and kd (min−1) are the H2O2 formation and decomposition rates, respectively. The kd values were firstly estimated by fitting the data in Fig. 6 c and then kf values were calculated according to Eq. (7) [70]. (7) [ H 2 O 2 ] = K f K d ( 1 - exp ( - k d × t ) As seen in Fig. 6 c, the value of kf for W/CN–SUP (14.1 μmol L-1 min−1) is 11.1 and 3.2 times higher compared with those of the CN-ML (4.01 μmol L-1 min−1) and CN–SUP (1.2 μmol L-1 min−1), respectively. Meanwhile, the value of kd for the W/CN–SUP, CN–SUP, and CN-ML are 0.022, 0.013, 0.0048 min−1, indicating that the decomposition pathway is being less significant. Moreover, no significant decrease in the photocatalytic production of H2O2 is observed for W/CN–SUP, indicating the photocatalyst is stable (Fig. 6 d). These results obviously show that the synergistic effects of the highly condensed structure of CN and intimate interface with WO3 are a great approach to prepare heterojunction with strong photocatalytic abilities in degradation of organic pollutants and H2O2 production. 3.6.3 Intermediates identification and degradation pathway of TC Since TC has been considered as emerging organic contaminants in waterway and water body, characterizing the intermediates formed during the photodegradation process of TC is of great importance. LC–MS/MS analysis was conducted for the photodegradation of TC, to obtain deep insight into the photocatalytic performance of the W/CN–SUP heterojunction. There are investigations on the TC intermediate using photocatalysis in the literature [71,72]. To feel assured, three samples were monitored from standard solution (STD) of TC to adsorption in dark within 15 min and 60 min as shown in Fig. S17 c of the SI. It shows that the parent STD solution indicates one peak at 445 m/z with high intensities, corresponding to the characteristic peak of TC. After 15 min under dark conditions, the intensity of 445 m/z is remarkably decreased from 10000 to 1500, which is in complete agreement with the results obtained from absorption–desorption equilibrium. More interestingly, the decreasing trend of m/z = 445 along with several intermediates is followed by extending the dark condition to 60 min (see chromatogram of adsorption/60 min in dark). This highly suggests that without direct light irradiation, the W/CN–SUP heterojunction can degrade TC for long time. The reason for this might be the strong ability of WO3 nanoparticles as the oxidation catalyst, and its combination with CN nanosheets. This hypothesis is further confirmed after illumination for 15 min, so that no peak associated with TC remains anymore, and only the peak at 416 m/z is pronounced. By keeping the irradiation at 30 min, some intermediates with very low intensities appear around 123, 154, 194, 219, 222, 259, 342, 354, 416, 451, and 542 m/z. According to the above results, a possible degradation pathway based on the LC–MS/MS chromatogramis proposed in Scheme 2 . The degradation pathway can be initiated by attacking photogenerated •O2 – radicals, as the main active species, to N-methyl groups from dimethylamino at C4, since N(CH3)2 functional groups are more susceptible owing to the low energy of the N-C bond. A similar result was reported for the TC degradation [73] and other organic compounds such as RhB degradation [74]. Hence, the oxidation of TC results in the formation of P1 (m/z = 448) following hydration at C11a and C2 and production of P2 (m/z = 416). Leaving amid group from the P2 backbone at C2 along with dehydration at C6 results in the formation of P3 (m/z = 356). Then, P4 (m/z = 356) results from removal of the carbonyl group at C4 which occurs under visible-light illumination. The TC degradation mechanism is perused via simultaneously dealkylation and consequently ring opening several times, giving birth to small fragmentations such as P8 (m/z = 194), P9 (m/z = 154), P10 (m/z = 222), and P11 (m/z = 123). These intermediates produced in a short time after irradiation clearly reveal four important phenomena: (i) demethylation, (ii) amide group oxidation, (iii) double bond oxidation, (iv) dealkylation, and (v) ring openings. 3.6.4 Toxicity evaluation Considering the importance of toxicity for produced intermediate during photodegradation process the acute toxicity (LD50), bioaccumulation factors, developmental toxicity, and mutagenicity of intermediates, were estimated. The toxicity parameters were evaluated using the Toxicity Estimation Software Tool (T.E.S.T.) based on the quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) method [75,76]. Among all intermediates, only the acute toxicity of P6 is not predicted. As illustrated in Fig. 7 a based on the acute oral toxicity, TC considered a very toxic chemical. All degradation intermediates of TC exhibited higher LD50 which indicates acute toxicity for the intermediates is significantly decreased especially for five final produced intermediates. Interestingly, P10 and P11 with LD50 greater than 5000 are not toxic based on the globally harmonized system (GHS) categorization of chemicals. However, as shown in Fig. 7 b, although the bioaccumulative factors of most products are higher than TC, these values for the final intermediate, P10 and P11, are much lower than the original solution which is favorable. As can be seen in Fig. 7 c, TC is a “developmental toxicant”, besides P2, P5, and P7, all other intermediates showed lower development toxicity, and even P9, P10, and P11 become “developmental non-toxic”. Mutagenicity of TC is positive and the treatment process could reduce the mutagenicity of the main final intermediate of P7-P11. Further, for P7, P9, P10, and P11, the value of mutagenicity is declined to the negative ranges (see Fig. 7 d). According to the predicted toxicity, the photodegradation process reduced the toxicity of TC, but some toxicity still remained. It seems that when the third ring of TC has opened the toxicity of intermediate is significantly alleviated, which is in agreement with Khan et.al, when they presented the three-ring structure of TC have similar toxicities to TC [76]. Therefore, although TC can be entirely removed after just 30 min and the final products of P10 and P11 are in the category of non-toxic chemicals, to gain the complete purification process, it is necessary to extend the photocatalytic reaction time. 3.6.5 Photocatalytic mechanism of W/CN–SUP All the experimental and characterization results including textural, photoelectrochemical, optical, and also photocatalytic properties reflect that the W/CN–SUP shows enhanced visible–light ability which is due to its high surface area, large pore volume, and the well-organized interface between WO3 and CN. One of the main reasons due to the fact that well-organized W/CN–SUP is taking full advantage of their interplays. After encountering light to the surface of W/CN–SUP, ultrathin CN nanosheets with high surface area in turn harvest a wide range of visible–light irradiation and accelerate the charge transition from the bulk to the surface because of a short diffusion length. In addition, WO3 with the band gap of 2.77 eV is also able to receive the visible–light wavelengths at the same time, and results in the creation of more photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Based on capturing results, •O2 –, •OH, and holes are produced in the presence of W/CN–SUP photocatalyst, denoting that excitons not only are generated but also are efficiently separated and more accessible to interact with surrounding molecules. The basis on the estimated VB and CB positions for CN–SUP and WO3 components as depicted in Fig. 8 , the holes on the VB level of CM–CN (1.76 eV) are not enough positive to thermodynamically drive the half-reaction of OH–/•OH (1.99 eV), and electrons on the CB level of WO3 (−0.19 eV) are not able to induce the half-reaction of O2/•O2 – (−0.33 eV) [18,77]. Conversely, the photogenerated electron on the CB level of CN–SUP (−1.18 eV) and the photogenerated holes on the VB level of WO3 (2.58 eV) can overcome on thermodynamic barriers of the above-mentioned reactions. Based on the above discussion, a Z-scheme charge carrier transfer mechanism is proposed. The electrons on the CB level of WO3 are quenched by holes on the VB level of CM–CN, presenting electrons and holes with the strongest reduction and strongest oxidation abilities on the CB level of CN-SUP and VB level of WO3, respectively [48,78,79]. Hence, electrons interact with oxygen molecules to produce •O2 – and consequently, holes in the valance band oxidize hydroxide radicals to generate •OH. These active species can attack the adsorbed RhB and TC on the photocatalyst surface having large pore volume, and consequently leading to their removal to CO2 and H2O. In addition, since •O2 – was confirmed as a predominant species in the photocatalytic reaction, it may suggest that the H2O2 can be produced via a two-step single-electron O2 reduction process (Eqs. (8) to (11)). W/CN–SUP photocatalyst with extended optical absorption, excellent physical, and texture properties provides the boosted electron-hole pairs and consequently more high-active species for target reactions. Schematic illustration of the photodegradation mechanism of TC/RhB and H2O2 production over the W/CN–SUP photocatalyst is shown in Fig. 8.

18,Conclusions,"This study reports a simple, scalable, and efficient method presents the impressive W/CN–SUP heterojunction in which highly condensed CN nanosheets, and well–distributed WO3 nanoparticles, are obtained. This method relies on the in situ growth of tungsten ions on the stable supramolecular self–assembly, followed by thermal polycondensation. This leads to the modified solid–state reaction along well–dispersed WO3 nanoparticles, making a tight interface between the WO3 and CN portions. The detailed characterization results unveil extended optical absorption in the whole spectrum, excellent charge separation, and impressive photocatalytic performance. The W/CN–SUP heterojunction exhibits high photocatalytic activities toward the photodegradation of RhB (12 mg L–1) and TC (12 mg L–1) during 8 and 15 min, respectively. Moreover, the photocatalyst showed a high hydrogen peroxide production rate of 161 μmol L-1 under visible light irradiation. This study also provides information on finding better interface techniques, such as impregnation and physical mixing–thermal treatment, for enhancement of the charge carrier transitions. Finally, LC–MS/MS analysis identifies the intermediates with a higher value of LD50, lower bioaccumulation factor, and much negative mutagenicity compared to pollutant TC."
