0,Introduction,"Due to their excellent properties such as low volatility, higher thermal stability, and electrical conductivity, ILs (ionic liquids) have many applications in catalysis, electrical batteries, and displays. Specifically at room temperature, ILs are considered noble solvents as they are composed of ions [1]. Using very simple water soluble anions [2,3] and more complex hydrophobic anions generally small molecular ionic liquids can be prepared readily for many purposes [4–6]. Their highly ionic nature, potent solvent ability, almost zero vapor pressure and non-flammability, high chemical stability and nontoxicity, provide ILs extraordinary and tunable physicochemical environments to be used in energy applications such as for hydrogen generation, solar cells, batteries, fuel cells, and super capacitors [7–12]. ILs have been investigated for advanced material design using LBL (layer by layer) by manipulating their cationic and ionic structures [12–14]. The monomers such as methacrylate-based imidazolium can be modified with various anionic groups e.g., sodium tetrafluoroborate and bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide and used in the synthesis of polymers with various ionic liquid contents with interesting properties. The prepared copolymers showed increased ionic conductivity over an order of magnitude with the lower glass transition temperature (T g) [7]. As ILs are organic salts, and are weakly associated, they can even be employed in flexible, transparent film formations, in fiber and composite preparation, capsule generation and surface modifications [9–15]. The most widely used organic cations and anions used in the preparation of ILs are N-alkylpyridiniums, and N, N′-imidazoluim, as well as tetraalkyammonium ([C4N]+), tetralkylphosphonium ([C4P]+), trialkysulfonium ([C3S]+), tetrafluoroborate ([BF4]−), hexafluorophosphate ([PF6]−), alkylsulfate ([RSO4]−), dicyanamide ([N(CN)2]−), bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([NTf2]−), and trifluoromethanesulfonate triflate ([OTf]−) [15–18]. Also, some metal salts such as NiCl2 and CoCl2 are also used for ionic liquid preparation [4,5,10]. ILs can be rationalized using these non-symmetrical cations according to desired performances to provide different characteristics in terms of reaction solvent, heat capacity, viscosity and so on [8,17]. The use of ionic liquid varies from high CO2 sorption capacity [19] to direct use as catalyst for bio-oil upgrading through the esterification reaction of organic acids and ethanol at room temperature to improve the properties of bio-oils [20]. ILs can also be used for the extraction of phenols from aqueous environments [21]. Cross-linked polymer ionic liquid has been prepared by only a few researchers using imidazole monomers by modification to convert imidazolium ionic liquids with various alkyl chain lengths by in situ polymerization or dispersion polymerization [15,22]. More recently micron-sized ionic liquid particles were prepared after the modification of a cationic monomer, 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl] trimethylammonium chloride to 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl] trimethylammonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide by dispersion polymerization [23]. Here, we report the preparation of p(4-VP) (poly(4-vinyl pyridine))-based colloidal ionic liquid particles by post-polymerization modification methods. Firstly, p(4-VP) pyridine nanoparticles were prepared and modified by quaternization with 1,4-dibromobutane to generate dicationic structures or linkage between the nitrogen atoms of the repeating pyridines. Then ionic liquids of the colloidal p(4-VP) particles were obtained by interacting these quaternized particles with Ni(II) and Co(II) solutions in ethanol. Finally, the prepared dicationic p(4-VP) particles containing metal ions were used as a catalyst system in the hydrolysis of sodium borohydride for hydrogen generation. Sodium borohydride was considered one of the most suitable hydrogen storage materials over the past decade and is still a great interest for portable applications, although the US DOE (U.S. Department of Energy) published a No-Go recommendation [24]. Sodium borohydride was widely studied among the other chemical hydrides because of its high hydrogen storage capacity (10.8%), stability, and nontoxicity. However, according to DOE's No-Go recommendation, the main deficiency of sodium borohydride is its storage capacity targets [24,25]. Therefore, there have been many alternative novel designs in order to improve gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity by using acid or catalyst precursors, or using solid NaBH4/adding water methods or NaBH4 polymers [25]. In addition, many investigations indicate that sodium borohydride hydrolysis reaction is more stable in a basic medium and pH is the limiting parameter [25,26]. By means of heterogeneous catalysis, pH dependence can be decreased for the hydrolysis reaction [26]. Therefore, in this study we investigated the preparation of p(4-VP)BB-CoCl2 and p(4-VP)BB-NiCl2 and their use as catalyst systems in sodium borohydride hydrolysis reaction without using NaOH."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials 4-VP (4-vinylpyridine) (Sigma, 95%) as monomer, EGDMA (ethylene glycol dimethacrylate) (Fluka, 98%) as a crosslinker, APS (ammonium persulfate) (Aldrich, 99%) as redox initiator, and 1-BB (1,4-dibromobutane) (Aldrich, 99%) as modifying and quaternization agent were used. The surfactant, SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate sodium salt), was purchased from Sigma (99%) and used as an emulsifying agent. Nickel (II) chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2.6H2O, Sigma–Aldrich, reagent plus), and cobalt (II) chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2.6H2O, Sigma–Aldrich, reagent plus) were used as received in the preparation of colloidal liquid particles. All the reagents and solvents (acetone and ethanol, acetonitrile) were of analytical grade or highest purity available, and used without further purification. Distilled water, 18.2 megohm-cm (Barnstead), was used throughout the experiments."
3,P(4-VP) and dicationic p(4-VP) synthesis,"2.2 P(4-VP) and dicationic p(4-VP) synthesis P(4-VP) nanoparticles were synthesized in accordance with procedures reported previously with some modification [24–27]. In short, p(4-VP) nanoparticles were prepared in an SDS oil-in-water microemulsion system. To a 0.1 M 150 mL SDS solution, 3 mL (0.02882 mol) of 4-VP was added and mixed. To this solution, 0.525 mL EGDMA (10 mol % relative to 4-VP amount) was added and vortexed until an isotropic solution was obtained. Then this mixture was placed in a temperature-controlled oil bath to bring the temperature to 75 °C at 800 rpm constant stirring rate. The polymerization was initiated by adding 5 mL of aqueous initiator solution that contained APS (2 mol % relative to the monomer) and the reaction proceeded for 12 h. The synthesized p(4-VP) nanoparticles were purified by several centrifugation cycles at 14,000 rpm for 30 min each at 10 °C and washed with acetone, recentrifuged again. Then p(4-VP) nanoparticles were freeze dried and stored in a closed container for further use. Dicationic p(4-VP) particles were prepared as shown in Fig. 1 a, 0.830 g p(4-VP) particles (7.89 mmol based on repeating unit) were placed in 125 mL toluene and placed in an ice bath at 0 °C temperature. Then 0.424 mL (3.55 mmol) 1,4-dibromobutane was added step wise (106 μl was added each time) during a 2 h period in the ice bath. The stirring was continued at this temperature for another 30 min before elevating the temperature to 110 °C for 12 h at 800 rpm mixing rate. The particles precipitated by centrifugation at 14000 rpm and were washed with acetone several times, dried with a heating gun at room temperature and kept in a closed container."
4,P(4-VP) colloidal ionic liquid preparation from Ni and Co salts,"2.3 P(4-VP) colloidal ionic liquid preparation from Ni and Co salts Dicationic p(4-VP) particles weighing 0.00951 mol (based on 4-VP repeating unit) were placed in 60 mL ethanol containing 0.00237 mol dissolved NiCl2.6H2O and CoCl2.6H2O at room temperature under 750 rpm mixing rate. The mixing continued at room temperature for 6 days. Finally, p(4-VP)-(CH2)4-tetrachloro nickelate and p(4-VP)-(CH2)4-tetrachloro cobaltate particles were centrifuged several times at 10,000 rpm to completely remove the soluble nickel chloride/cobalt chloride and precipitate the particles. The washing continued until no more green color for nickel or blue color for cobalt was obtained in the wash ethanol solution. The metal loaded particles, p(4-VP)-(CH2)4-tetrachloro nickelate and p(4-VP)-(CH2)4-tetrachloro cobaltate were dried in an oven at 50 °C and stored in a closed container for characterization and for further use in catalysis experiments."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization The average diameter of the synthesized p(4-VP) particles were determined by a DLS (dynamic light scattering) instrument (Brookhaven Ins. and Cor. 90 plus particle size analyzer). The DLS experiment was carried out employing 90° angle detector, with 35 mW solid state laser detector operating at a wavelength of 658 nm. The results are average values of ten consecutive measurements with an integration time of 2 s. Zeta potential measurements were conducted with Zeta-Pals Zeta Potential Analyzer BIC (Brookhaven Inst. Corp.) in 1 mM KCl solution in water. The FT-IR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Perkin Elmer spectrum 100) spectra of p(4-VP) particles were recorded in the spectral range 4000–650 cm−1 using total reflectance (ATR) at 4 cm−1 resolution. Thermal analyses of p(4-VP)-based particles were carried out using a thermo gravimetric analyzer (SII TG/DTA 6300) to determine the metal content of p(4-VP) particles. TGA (Thermo Gravimetric Analyzer) analysis was performed under nitrogen atmosphere with 100 mL/min flow rate at the heating rate of 10 °C/min up to 1000 °C. The amounts of nickel and cobalt in colloidal particles were also determined by using AAS (Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy) (Thermo, ICA 3500 AA SPECTRO)."
6,Hydrolysis of sodium borohydride,"2.5 Hydrolysis of sodium borohydride P(4-VP) colloidal dicationic particles (0.03 g) were mixed with 50 mL 0.30 g aqueous NaBH4 at 1000 rpm in a reaction flask. The volume of the produced hydrogen gas with time was determined by an upside down graded cylinder experimental setup where the generated hydrogen gas replaces water and obtained hydrogen gas passes through a washing bottle containing concentrated H2SO4 that captures the water vapor. All the reactions were carried out three times at 40 °C and 1 atm pressure. The effects of metal type, temperature, metal loading time and reusability were also investigated. Hydrogen generation rates, activation energy, activation enthalpy and activation entropy were determined."
7,Results and discussion,"Particles based on p(4-VP) have been prepared in microemulsion polymerization for various purposes as antimicrobial agents, drug delivery and catalysis [27–30]. Here, we used p(4-VP) particles for colloidal ionic liquid particle preparation via post modification in which p(4-VP) particles were initially prepared followed by quaternization of the pyridine ring to generate cationic charges. Furthermore, the dicationic p(4-VP) particles were reacted with metal salts in ethyl alcohol for ionic liquid formation. Fig. 1a illustrates the reaction between 1,4-dibromobutane and the nitrogen atoms on the pyridine rings of p(4-VP), whereas Fig. 1b shows the Ni or Co chloride salts reacting with quaternized pyridine rings to form colloidal ionic liquid. These reactions were done on pyridine compounds [4,5,10], here we are reporting the same reactions on colloidal particles derived from p(4-VP)."
8,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization In order to determine the particle size of ionic colloidal liquids, DLS measurements were completed and the sizes of synthesized p(4-VP) particles were around 393 nm, and dicationic p(4-VP) particles were around 519 nm. Zeta potential measurements were also studied, and results are presented in Table 1 . As can be seen, the quaternization reaction of p(4-VP) with BB increases the zeta potential of p(4-VP)BB to 23.26 mV from 0.68 mV. Interestingly, the loading of p(4-VP)BB with Ni and Co chloride salts also further increase the zeta potential of p(4-VP)BB to 38.03 and 35.69 mV for p(4-VP)BB-NiCl4 and p(4-VP)BB-CoCl4 colloidal ionic liquid particles, respectively, as confirmation of metal salt loading. To determine the exact amount of Co and Ni inside p(4-VP) colloidal ionic liquid particles, AAS and TG analyses were performed. P(4-VP)-(CH2)4-tetrachloro nickelate and p(4-VP)-(CH2)4-tetrachloro cobaltate particles were treated three times with 50 mL 5 M HCl to dissolve the metal ions. Thus, the amount of absorbed Co(II) and Ni(II) ions inside p(4-VP) colloidal ionic liquid were determined by using AAS measurements. The effect of metal loading time was investigated by contacting p(4-VP)BB with metal ions for 4, 6 and 10 days. It was found that p(4-VP)-(CH2)4-tetrachloro nickelate particles have 68.63 ± 0.04 mg Ni, and p(4-VP)-(CH2)4-tetrachloro cobaltate particles have 110.96 ± 0.05 mg Co per gram after ten days metal loading, and obtained results are presented in Table 2 . As can be seen the metal loadings increased with the increase in time of contact. Additionally, TGA analysis of colloidal ionic liquids were also carried out to determine the thermal behaviors of particles and to compare the TGA results with the AAS results. The thermograms of p(4-VP), dicationic p(4-VP)BB, p(4-VP)BB-NiCl4, and p(4-VP)BB-CoCl4 systems were recorded and the obtained thermograms are given in Fig. 2 . According to the TGA results, heating up to 1000 °C p(4-VP)BB-NiCl4 has at least 2.16 wt% Ni, and p(4-VP)BB-CoCl4 has at least 16.72 wt% Co particles. Also, as can be seen from TGA analysis, p(4-VP)-based particles are thermally stable and no weight loss can be observed up to almost 300 °C. The prepared colloidal ionic liquids were also characterized by FT-IR analysis, and corresponding results are presented in Fig. 3 . P(4-VP) particles have characteristic C–H stretching frequency at 2934 cm−1, CO stretching at 1723 cm−1, CC stretching at 1595 cm−1 and dicationic p(4-VP) particles have N-R stretching frequency at 3408 cm−1, and quaternization stretching frequency at 1638 cm−1."
9,Sodium borohydride hydrolysis reactions,"3.2 Sodium borohydride hydrolysis reactions The ideal NaBH4 hydrolysis reaction generates hydrogen gas according to the following irreversible and exothermic reaction: (1) NaBH4 (aq) + 2H2O → 4H2 + NaBO2 (aq) + Heat Based on the reaction stoichiometry, fully hydrolyzed 1 g of NaBH4 will produce 2.37 L of hydrogen gas at STP (standard temperature and pressure) [24]. In practice, excess water is required because of the solid by-product. (2) NaBH4 (aq) + (2 + x) H2O → NaBO2∙xH2O + 4H2 In the presence of catalysts and suitable pH ideally x should be zero [25], and this reaction is generally done in the presence of NaOH. The p(4-VP)BB-NiCl4, and p(4-VP)BB-CoCl4 systems were used as catalyst systems during NaBH4 hydrolysis reactions. Colloidal ionic liquids containing 0.54 mmol Co, and Ni particles were used in hydrolysis of NaBH4 at 40 °C and 1000 rpm mixing rate without using NaOH. Although the same amount of NaBH4 (0.30 g) is used, 800 mL hydrogen gas was produced with p(4-VP)BB-NiCl4 particles in 140 min, whereas the same amount of hydrogen gas was produced in 80 min with p(4-VP)BB-CoCl4 providing 98% conversion for both particles for six day metal-loading periods. So, the p(4-VP)BB-CoCl4 particles have better activity than p(4-VP)BB-NiCl4. Fig. 4 a illustrates the comparison of the metal species for NaBH4 hydrolysis. The reaction rates relating to hydrolysis of NaBH4 were 3148 (mL H2) (min)−1 (g of Co)−1 for Co and 1803 (mL H2) (min)−1 (g of Ni)−1 for Ni. The total TOF (turnover frequencies) were calculated for p(4-VP) colloidal ionic liquids, and they were 7.21 mol H2 (mol catalyst.min)−1 and 4.10 mol H2 (mol catalyst.min)−1 for p(4-VP)BB-CoCl4 and p(4-VP)BB-NiCl4, respectively. Results show that NaOH-free colloidal dicationic particles are very effective for catalytic sodium borohydride hydrolysis reaction. Most of the investigations carried out in reaction media containing different amounts of NaOH (1–5 wt%) resulted in somehow faster reaction kinetics; however, this investigation findings are in contrast to generally reported results. The deactivation of the catalyst system in basic media is the formation the NaBO2 that is insoluble when sodium borohydride use in the reaction media that can reduce the lifetime of the catalyst systems [31–34]. Here, in this investigations reactions were carried NaOH free medium as the use of NaOH prevented H2 production. The ability of NaOH free NaBH4 hydrolysis reaction could be due to the presence of quaternized ammonium salts. Therefore, the existence of dicationic functionality in the structure can provide inherently basic medium necessitating no more additional base to the reaction media providing great advantages. The amounts of metal catalysts also affect the H2 production rate in hydrolysis of chemical hydrides. Therefore, to determine whether the metal loading time affects the hydrolysis of NaBH4, prepared colloidal dicationic particles were exposed to metal-loading periods of different times; 4, 6, and 10 days, respectively. Metal loading time affects the amount of absorbed metal species, and it was found that 10 days metal-loaded particles have higher amounts of metal ions. However, according to the sodium borohydride hydrolysis reaction six day-loaded particles were more effective than the other ones. In Fig. 4b and c, the volume of hydrogen gas against metal loading time is presented. All the reactions were carried out at 40 °C at 1000 rpm mixing rate by using 0.03 g colloidal dicationic particles and 0.30 g NaBH4. Four days Co-loaded colloidal dicationic particles generated 700 mL hydrogen gas in 210 min with 85% conversion, 6 day Co-loaded colloidal dicationic particles generated 800 mL hydrogen gas in 80 min with 98% conversion, and 10 day Co-loaded colloidal dicationic particles generated 755 mL hydrogen gas in 76 min with 92% conversion. Hydrogen generation rates are estimated to be 2598 (mL H2) (min)−1 (g of Co)−1 for 4 day-loaded particles, 3148 (mL H2) (min)−1 (g of Co)−1 for 6 day-loaded particles, and 2984 (mL H2) (min)−1 (g of Co)−1 for 10 day-loaded particles. Moreover, 4 day Ni-loaded colloidal dicationic particles generated 700 mL hydrogen gas at 410 min, 6 days, and 10 days Ni-loaded colloidal dicationic particles generated the same amount of hydrogen gas at 110 min and 140 min, respectively, with 85% conversion. For further studies, 6 day Co-loaded colloidal dicationic particles were chosen because of their effectiveness. The difference between metal loading ability for different metal salts could be due to the difference in the absorption characteristics of the dicationic p(4-VP)BB for Ni and Co salts. It is important that the metal salts are in ethyl alcohol assuming not ionic form but rather molecular forms. 3.2.1 Effect of NaBH4 concentration on sodium borohydride hydrolysis To determine the effect of amount of NaBH4, 0.03 g p(4-VP)BB-CoCl4 was used as catalyst system at 40 °C for different concentrations (0.3, 0.6, 1.2 wt%) of NaBH4. In Fig. 5 , the results show that the increase in the amount of NaBH4 increases the hydrogen generation rate. The reaction rates relating to hydrolysis of NaBH4 were 3444 (mL H2) (min)−1 (g of Co)−1 for 1.2 wt% of NaBH4, 3148 (mL H2) (min)−1 (g of Co)−1 for 0.6 wt% of NaBH4, and 2847 (mL H2) (min)−1 (g of Co)−1 for 0.3 wt% of NaBH4. Therefore, for hydrolysis reactions of NaBH4, the optimum amount of NaBH4 was determined to be 0.6 wt%. 3.2.2 Effect of temperature on sodium borohydride hydrolysis To investigate the effect of temperature on hydrolysis of NaBH4 catalyzed by 0.03 g p(4-VP)BB-CoCl4, the reaction was carried out at 30 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C, and 80 °C using 0.30 g NaBH4 without using NaOH. The effects of temperature on NaBH4 hydrolysis were compared using the initial 5 min H2 production extents of hydrolysis reactions carried out at different temperatures under same conditions, and corresponding graph is illustrated in Fig. 6 , and it was found that 70 mL hydrogen gas was generated at 30 °C, 134 mL at 40 °C, 328 mL at 60 °C, and 700 mL at 80 °C. These results verify that temperature rise increases hydrogen generation rates significantly. To analyze the data at different temperatures obtained from experiments three different kinetic models were applied to NaBH4 hydrolysis catalyzed by p(4-VP)BB-CoCl4. According to zero-order kinetics, the rate of consumption of NaBH4 is equal to the reaction rate constant: (3) ( C A , 0 − C A ) = k t If the reaction is first order, the reaction rate becomes; (4) ln ( C A , 0 / C A ) = k t The slope of (C A,0 – C A) and ln(C A,0/C A) plotted as a function of time gives reaction rate constants where C A,0 is the initial concentration of NaBH4, and C A is the concentration at time t (min) and k (min−1) is the rate constant. By using reaction rate constants ln k−1/T curve, and ln (k/T)−1/T graphs were constructed to apply Arrhenius and Eyring equations, respectively. In Fig. 7 , the corresponding graphs are given. Langmuir–Hinshelwood model is also used very often to predict the reaction kinetics: (5) K 0 − 1 ln ( C A , 0 / C A ) + ( C A , 0 − C A ) = k t Here, K 0 is the adsorption constant. Using Eq (5) the slope of K 0 − 1 ln(C A,0/C A) + (C A,0 – C A) plot as a function of time gives the reaction rate constant. In order to predict the optimum K 0 value, hydrogen generation data of 40 and 80 °C were used. Different K 0 values were chosen between the interval of 0.1–2 to find the regression coefficients of K 0 − 1 ln(C A,0/C A) + (C A,0 – C A) plots by means of an iterative method. After that, optimum K 0 value should be estimated by using the following function; (6) f min ( K 0 ) = ( 1 − R 2 2 ) − ( 1 − R 1 2 ) where R 2 is the regression coefficient for data at 80 °C, and R 1 is the regression coefficient for data at 40 °C. The minimum point of the parabolic curve is determined by taking the first derivative and it was found that the optimum K 0 value is 1.27 L/mol in Fig. 8 a. Then reaction constants can be determined by the slope of (1/1.27) ln(C A,0/C A) + (C A,0 – C A) plot. The reaction rate constants based on three different kinetic models were estimated, and the results show that reaction rate constants increase with the increase in reaction temperature, which is given in Table 3 . According to Table 3, zero order kinetics show the best representation for the entire range of investigated temperatures. The Langmuir–Hinshelwood model can be recommended for temperatures above 40 °C. Arrhenius plot for Langmuir–Hinshelwood model is also presented in Fig. 8b. The activation energy, activation enthalpy, and activation entropy for the reaction of NaBH4 solution in the presence of the colloidal dicationic catalyst system were calculated as 43.98 kJ/mol, 40.38 kJ/mol, and −178.22 J/molK, respectively. Six day metal-loaded p(4-VP)BB-CoCl4 with its high hydrogen generation rate, 3148 (mL H2) (min)−1 (g of Co)−1, provides comparable low activation energy to some other previously studied catalyst systems, such as bulk nickel (70 kJ/mol) [31], Co–Mo–B/Ni foam (44.3 kJ/mol), and higher are Pt x Ni1−x nanoparticles (39 kJ/mol) [33]. Therefore, this colloidal ionic catalyst system shows great performance for sodium borohydride hydrolysis as a convenient catalyst system. However, its activation energy is still higher than some expensive catalysts such as Pt–Pd carbon nanotubes [34]. There are many investigations in the literature reported by others [31–35] uses different metal nanoparticles directly, and our groups [35–38] that uses functional hydrogel, microgel/nanogel to directly absorbs metal ions such as Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), Ru (II), Fe(II) and Fe(III) from aqueous environments and use as template for their corresponding metal nanoparticles preparations. Here, the prepared p(4-VP) colloids were modified with bromo alkanes to generate positively charged ionic liquid colloids and these ionic colloid used as template to load metal salts from ethanol solutions that are not dissolved in ionic form but molecular metal salts form as their chloride salts. Moreover, these metal salt loaded ionic colloids were used as catalysts in hydrogen production from NaBH4 hydrolysis. The catalysts ionic liquid colloid reported here is provide at least comparable and hydrogen production rates, and activation parameters and sometimes better than the similar investigations [31–38]."
10,Conclusion,"In this study, a new p(4-VP) colloidal ionic liquid particle preparation was reported and used as catalyst in NaBH4 hydrolysis for hydrogen generation. The amount of Co and Ni salts loaded into modified p(4-VP)BB colloidal particles to generate ionic liquids were determined by AAS. It was found that p(4-VP)-based colloidal ionic liquids containing 0.054 mmol Co(II), Ni(II) can effectively be used in NaOH-free hydrolysis of NaBH4 at 40 °C and 1000 rpm mixing rate. In the hydrolysis studies the reaction rates relating to hydrolysis of NaBH4 were 3148 (mL H2) (min)−1 (g of Co)−1 for Co, and 1803 (mL H2) (min)−1 (g of Ni)−1 for Ni catalyst systems. Different kinetic models were applied to hydrogen generation data for the hydrolysis of NaBH4, and reaction rate constants were determined. For wide temperature range, zero order kinetics were estimated to be applicable. The Langmuir–Hinshelwood model was better suited for temperatures from 40 °C to 80 °C. This model is accurate for the design of reactors that are operating at high temperatures. The activation energy, enthalpy, and entropy for the reaction of NaBH4 solution in the presence of colloidal dicationic Co salt catalyst system were calculated as 43.98 kJ/mol, 40.38 kJ/mol, and −178.22 J/mol.K, respectively. One can say that ionic liquids with their superior properties can be used as an alternative catalyst system for hydrogen generation from NaOH-free sodium borohydride hydrolysis. These ionic liquid colloidal catalyst systems with metal types and contents can also be used as effective catalyst systems for hydrogen generation from other sources such as ammonia borane, natural gas, water and so on with advanced material designs."
