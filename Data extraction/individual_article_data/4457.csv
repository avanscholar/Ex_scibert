0,Introduction,"Selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds to their corresponding unsaturated alcohols is a critical process in chemicals synthesis as the unsaturated alcohols are important intermediates for production of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals [1]. Noble metals such as Pt [2], Ir [3] and Au [4] are normally used as catalysts to achieve high selectivity of unsaturated alcohols in this process. Among them, Pt is one of the most widely studied metals. The common ways to enhance the selectivity of unsaturated alcohols include using different catalyst supports [5], controlling the catalyst particle sizes [6], constraining the catalyst active site space [7] or decorating the primary metals with a second metal component [8]. However, even with the above mentioned methods, completely pure product of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl that without any other by-products is still difficult to be obtained [9]. To improve the selectivity of unsaturated alcohols, alternative reactors were introduced recently to regulate the mass transfer among the reactants, products and active sites of catalyst. For example, Lee et al. [10] used a continuous flow reactor to replace the batch one and filled the reactor with Pt/SiO2 heterogeneous catalysts. They found that the CA selectivity could be enhanced by increasing the residence time. At a residence time of 15min, a 45% conversion and a maximum CAL selectivity of 60% were achieved. This demonstrated that the catalyst activity and selectivity were intimately correlated to the residence time of liquid on the catalyst active site. Rotating foam stirrer reactors (RFSRs) can control the residence time of liquid in the catalyst active site by changing the rotating speed of their stirring blades. Therefore, they were expected to exhibit better catalyst activity and selectivity than the above mentioned continuous flow reactor. Various porous materials, such as monoliths [11], cloths [12], and fibers [13] have been used as both the supports and stirrer in RFSRs to gain better catalyst activity. As a covalent compound, SiC possesses many outstanding advantages, such as high thermal conductivity and chemical inertness [14–15]. Therefore, it can be a promising and potential catalyst support. In present study, a RFSR with SiC foam stirrer blades was designed for the selective hydrogenation of CAL aiming at achieving a higher yield. The SiC foams were first coated by Al2O3 prior to the Pt loading. The factors like hydrogen pressure, cinnamaldehyde concentration and the rotating speed of blades that may influence the selectivity and activity of the catalyst have been systematically investigated and reported in this manuscript."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of SiC foam,2.1 Preparation of SiC foam The SiC foams adopted in this study were prepared by macromolecule pyrogenation combined with reaction bonding method. The detailed synthesis process of the SiC foams can be found in our previous study [16].
3,Preparation of Al2O3 washcoat on SiC foam,"2.2 Preparation of Al2O3 washcoat on SiC foam A stable alumina sol was prepared from pseudo-boehmite and deionized water in a weight ratio of 1:5. The mixture was vigorously stirred at 80°C for 1h, during which a small amount of nitric acid was added slowly to maintain a pH value of 2.0 [17]. Then the SiC foam was immersed into alumina sol for 10min. After taking out the excessive colloids residue in pores by blowing with an air pump, the SiC foam with wet Al2O3 colloids was dried in an oven at 60°C. The coating and drying process was repeated several times until a desired loading amount of Al2O3 was obtained. The as-prepared samples were finally calcined in a muffle furnace at 550°C for 3h to obtain the structured Al2O3–SiC support. The loading amount of Al2O3 (12wt%) was calculated from the weight difference between the weight of SiC after Al2O3 loading, and before Al2O3 loading."
4,Preparation of Pt/Al2O3–SiC catalyst,"2.3 Preparation of Pt/Al2O3–SiC catalyst Pt catalyst was prepared by successive impregnation using H2PtCl6·6H2O aqueous solution (19.3mmol/L) as Pt precursor. Briefly speaking, 5g Al2O3–SiC support was immersed in excessive H2PtCl6·6H2O aqueous solution (20mL) for 10min, dried at 110°C for 2h, and then calcined at 300°C in air for 2h. The same operation was repeated for two times. The catalyst was reduced at 300°C in hydrogen (50mL/min) for 3h prior to the catalytic test. Generally, the metal content in metal supported catalysts is analyzed by ICP, however the SiC is resistant to acid corrosion. Therefore the Pt loading (0.24wt%) was calculated from the weight difference between the weight of Al2O3–SiC after Pt loading, and before Pt loading, which was similar to that reported by Xu and coworkers [18]."
5,Catalyst characterizations,2.4 Catalyst characterizations The surface morphology of the support and catalyst were examined by scanning electron microscope (Inspect F50). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were carried out on a FEI T12 microscope at 120kV. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area was determined from N2 adsorption-desorption measurement (Micromeritics ASAP 2020 analyzer) at 77K. The XRD patterns of the Pt catalysts and support were obtained by a D/MAX-2500 PC X-ray diffractometer with monochromatized CuKα radiation (λ=1.54Å). CO chemisorption measurements were carried out on Catlab with a QIC-20 mass spectrometry from Hiden Analytical.
6,Catalytic reaction,"2.5 Catalytic reaction The hydrogenation experiments were conducted in a 1.0L autoclave with inner diameter of 90mm and height of 160mm, respectively (Fig. 1 ). The catalyst, which can be used as a foam stirrer (with a dimension of 8mm×10mm×60mm), was mounted on a shaft. The hydrogen was introduced from a top port. The reaction was conducted at room temperature and 3MPa under different rotation speeds in the range of 0–400rpm. The total volume of CAL 2-propanol (IPA) solution was 100mL. The reactor was thoroughly purged with H2 before the experiments. A certain amount of the liquid reactant was taken out regularly and analyzed by an Agilent 7890A gas chromatography (GC) equipped with a HP-5(30m×0.32mm×0.2μm) column and FID detector."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalyst characterizations,"3.1 Catalyst characterizations The SiC foam is an open-celled material consisting of reticulated structure of struts, as shown in Fig. S1a. Fig. S1b and Fig. S1c show the cross section of a foam strut coated by an Al2O3 washcoat layer of approximately 20μm thick. It was shown from Fig. S1d that the washcoat layer was well coated on the SiC foam support. The texture properties of the pristine SiC foam, Al2O3–SiC support and Pt/Al2O3–SiC catalyst were listed in Table 1 . It can be seen from the table that the surface area was increased from 1 to 28.4m2 g−1 after loading the Al2O3 washcoat layer on the SiC foam. The surface area is not obviously changed when Pt is loaded on the Al2O3–SiC support. Only obvious SiC and Si (residues in the preparation of SiC) diffraction peaks could be found in the XRD patterns (Fig. S2). The mean Pt particle size from the TEM images (Fig. S3) is 2.51±0.94nm, which is similar to that calculated from the CO chemisorption (1.77nm). The catalyst is very stable even up to 5 recycles, the morphology and surface area of the spent catalyst are not obviously changed."
9,Catalytic activity,"3.2 Catalytic activity 3.2.1 Effect of reaction time The products obtained in the hydrogenation of CAL are cinnamyl alcohol (CA), hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL) and phenyl propanol (PP) (see Scheme 1 in the supporting information), depending on the reaction conditions used. Other possible reaction products, such as methylstyrene, phenylpropane and acetals, were not detected in present work. The initial H2 pressure was optimized to 3MPa (Fig. S4). Fig. 2 gives the variations of CAL conversion ratio and products selectivity against reaction time. The CA selectivity stably maintains at 75% within the time range of 120–420min, whereas after 420min, it decreases while the PP selectivity increases. Most of the HCAL is formed at the initial reaction stage and thereafter the HCAL selectivity decreases gradually. Finally, only very little CAL is converted to HCAL. According to Breen et al. [19], the production of CA will inhibit the further formation of HCAL. Because PP is produced from hydrogenation of HCAL, the higher selectivity of CA is reasonably accompanied by lower PP amount. However, when the amount of CAL is too low (0.04mol/L) to conduct competitive adsorption with that of CA after successive consumption, PP begins to be generated by CA hydrogenation. This is well consistent with the changes of the relative amounts of CA, HCAL and PP in our experiments. 3.2.2 Effect of CAL concentration The initial rates of CAL hydrogenation depend greatly on CAL concentration. As shown in Fig. 3a, the initial rates increase with the CAL concentrations from 0.2 to 0.4mol/L, and then remained almost unchanged with the further increase of the CAL concentration. This result is similar with the work published by de Jong et al. [20] on hydrogenation of CAL over carbon nanofiber supported Pt catalyst. They believed that this can be explained by Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) adsorption kinetics. According to the L-H theory, at lower reactant concentration, only a small fraction of active sites on the catalyst surface are occupied by CAL. With the increase of CAL concentration, the occupation ratio keeps increasing, which results in a linear growth of the reaction rate with concentration. The surface is almost fully occupied by CAL at higher reactant concentration, therefore the activity becomes independent of CAL concentration. The TOF value of the Pt catalyst at the CAL initial concentration of 0.4mol/L, which is 0.78s−1, could be calculated based on the CO chemisorption results. The selectivity of products is also influenced by CAL concentration as shown in Fig. 3b. The CA selectivity increases by increasing the CAL concentration. But when the CAL concentration reaches 0.4mol/L, the influence of CAL concentration on CA selectivity is negligible. At a low CAL concentration, CAL will preferably adsorb in a flat manner on the surface by CC bond, leading to high HCAL selectivity, therefore the PP selectivity is high at low concentration because PP is derived from hydrogenation of HCAL. With the increase of CAL concentration, the adsorbed amount of CAL molecules increases. The adsorption occurs more favorably through a vertical atop geometry with CO bond rather than with CC bond due to the steric hindrance effect, which increases the CA selectivity and inhibit the production of HCAL. 3.2.3 Effect of rotating speed Fig. 4a shows the catalytic activities of the rotating foam stirrer reactor as a function of rotating speeds within the range of 0–400rpm. As is expected, the overall reaction rate with agitation is faster as compared to the static condition. Increasing the rotating speed from 100 to 300rpm gradually enhances the hydrogenation activity. This can be explained by the much improved mass transfer between the solid-liquid interfaces as more fluid flows through the foam matrix at higher rotating speed. It is supposed that the improved mass transfer might have increased the opportunity of contact between the reactants and the active sites, which leads to faster reaction rate. However, the reaction activity decreases dramatically when the rotating speed reaches 400rpm. This may be ascribed to the poor wetting of the internal surface of the foam struts because of the more violent vortices produced at high rotating speeds. Moreover, at excessively high rotating speeds, the contact between the liquid-solid interfaces is inadequate. In other words, the residence time of the reactants on the reactor is too short to react sufficiently. As a consequence, a lower conversion is observed. The relationship between the selectivity of the products and rotating speed is even more complex. As shown in Fig. 4b, CA selectivity shows maximum values at 100rpm. Extremely high selectivity of HCAL and PP is obtained at low CAL conversions when the stirrer is static. At the initial stage of the reaction, the catalyst active sites are saturated by hydrogen and CAL. The selectivity of HCAL is high at this stage, and a higher selectivity of PP is also obtained due to the easy hydrogenation of HCAL. With the production of CA, CA could competitively adsorbed with CAL and favorable for the producing of more CA, because of a steric effect, whereby the CAL adsorbs preferentially through a vertical atop geometry and favorable for the hydrogenation of carbonyl groups when CA competitively adsorbed with CAL [19]. The fast stirring could quickly drive the produced CA near the catalyst and introduce more unreacted CAL, leading to a quicker mass transfer rate, which would be unfavorable for the production of CA and decrease the selectivity of CA."
10,Conclusion,"In this paper, structural support made of SiC foam coated with Al2O3 is applied to prepare rotating foam stirrer catalyst. Selective hydrogenation of CAL is selected as a model reaction, and the effects of CAL concentration and rotating speed on the catalyst activity and selectivity were studied. The highest selectivity of 75% could be achieved at conversion as high as 90% at 100rpm. The selectivity to HCAL and PP is high at the initial reaction stage and then decreases with the successive conversion of CAL. The increased production of CA during the reaction could inhibit the production of HCAL due to competitively adsorption caused by the steric effect. The reaction rate increases with the increasing of the stirring speed up to 300rpm, and then decreased when the stirring speed increased to 400rpm, however the maximum selectivity is obtained at 100rpm."
