0,Introduction,"The conversion of primary and secondary alcohols into their corresponding aldehydes and ketones with high selectivity using semiconductor photocatalysts has been extensively studied in chemical industries. It has been reported that TiO2-based photocatalysts were used to partially convert the alkyl-substituted benzyl alcohols into their corresponding aldehydes in the presence of molecular O2 as an oxidant [1–7]. However, due to the high photocatalytic activity of TiO2 under UV light irradiation, the nonselective oxidation to CO2 easily occurred in the TiO2 photocatalyst system, which led to the low selectivity for the desired products [8,9]. Therefore, from the perspective of industrial applications, the development of novel and efficient visible-light-responsive photocatalysts for high conversion of the primary and secondary alcohol with high selectivity for the desired products is imperative but challenging [10,11]. Tungsten trioxide (WO3) is considered a good candidate for visible-light-driven photocatalysis because it has many advantages, including the wide absorption range in the solar spectrum, stable physical and chemical properties, and long hole-diffusion length [12,13]. It has also been proven that the photocatalytic efficiency is highly related to structure, morphology, and unique surface characteristics [14,15]. In particular, a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical nanostructure with larger specific surface area and more surface active sites and better permeability has tremendous potential in electrochemical, optical and catalytic applications [16,17]. Therefore, considerable efforts have been made to synthesize three-dimensional photocatalysts with unique structures to achieve high activities [18,19]. To date, most of the studies have focused on the morphological control of WO3 in the construction of one-dimensional nanostructures, including nanorods, nanotubes and nanowires [20]. The design of a 3D hierarchical nanostructure on WO3 is rarely reported. On the other hand, the relatively lower conduction band (CB) edge (approximately +0.3–0.5 V vs. NHE) than the reduction potentials of O2 severely limits the photocatalytic applications of WO3, which can largely decrease the photocatalytic efficiency owing to the rapid recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes [21]. Semiconductor coupling [22,23] and noble metal deposition (Au, Pt and Pd) [24–30] on WO3 were reported to solve the above problems because the introduction of other semiconductors or noble metal nanoparticles favor the effective separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes and thus enhance the photocatalytic efficiency. In addition to the above two methods, the construction of photocatalysts with mixed phases has also been investigated to promote the separation of electron-hole pairs. For instance, enhanced photocatalytic performance has been demonstrated in TiO2 photocatalysts with mixed phases, including anatase/rutile [31–34], anatase/brookite [35,36], anatase/TiO2(B) [37], and rutile/brookite [38]. Recently, Bi2O4-x/Bi2O3 [39], In2O3/In2O3·3H2O [40] and WO3/WO3·H2O [41] photocatalysts with mixed phases have also been developed. To the best of our current knowledge, no study has yet been found that describes a facile and effective method that can in situ synthesize the 3D hierarchical structural WO3-based photocatalysts with mixed phases. In this study, we proposed the first report of a facile synthesis of Pd-loaded urchin-like (NH4)xWO3/WO3 photocatalysts with 3D hierarchical structure and mixed phases through thiourea-involved alcoholysis reaction of WCl6 and PdCl2, and subsequent reductive calcination. The realization of the direct construction of such a photocatalyst is based on the following inspirations. Choi et al. synthesized tungsten oxide (W18O49) nanorods through the hydrothermal reaction of WCl6 with ethanol in an autoclave [42]. This synthetic process was considered to obey classical self-aggregation and Ostwald ripening growth mechanisms. It was also reported by Custelcean that thiourea could make organic crystals assemble effectively into nanostructures, including one dimensional chains and even the spatial structure, because thiourea has strong hydrogen-bonding properties [43]. It therefore is feasible that thiourea could be a suitable directing ligand for the construction of inorganic WO3-based nanostructures in an ethanol/WCl6 system. We further investigated the application of the as-prepared visible-light-responsive Pd-loaded (NH4)xWO3/WO3 photocatalyst in the partial conversion of benzyl alcohol solution in the presence of the dissolved O2 as the oxidant. DFT calculations for the reaction mechanism between benzyl alcohol and active radicals were carried out. The results showed the efficient partial oxidation of benzyl alcohol with high selectivity for benzaldehyde production was obtained over the Pd/(NH4)xWO3/WO3 photocatalyst under illumination."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The raw materials, including tungsten (VI) chloride (WCl6), palladium chloride (PdCl2) and thiourea (CS(NH2)2) were obtained from Wako Pure Chemicals Ind., Ltd., Japan. Benzyl alcohol is commercially available and was used directly without further purification. The solvents used in this study are distilled water and absolute ethanol. All other reagents were of analytical grade and used without further retreatment."
3,Photocatalyst preparation,"2.2 Photocatalyst preparation WCl6 (1 mmol, 0.397 g) and a required amount of PdCl2 (0.5 wt % as metal) were first dissolved in 40 mL of absolute ethanol in the beaker at the room temperature, respectively. After completely dissolved, thiourea with different amounts (0-20 mmol) was added into the above solution, and ultra-sonicated for 3 min. The mixture solution was then transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave, sealed and maintained at 180 °C for 8 h. After reaction, the precipitate was collected and washed three times with absolute ethanol and distilled water through centrifugation, respectively. After that, the product was then dried at 60 °C for 5 h. As a control samples were prepared in the presence of different amount of PdCl2 (0.1, 0.5 and 1 wt %) and thiourea (5 mmol) with the other above conditions unchanged. The as-prepared dried product was subsequently transferred in a 30 mL alumina crucible. Then, the 30 mL alumina crucible with the as-prepared sample was placed into a 100 mL alumina crucible containing activated carbon (3 g, Wako Pure Chemicals Ind., Ltd., Japan). The alumina cover was then put on the 100 mL crucible. This reaction container was transferred into the electric furnace which was elevated to a given temperature (450 °C) in 4 h, then maintained at 450 °C for 3 h. After that, the sample was naturally cooled to room temperature and a light grey product was obtained for use. The schematic diagram of the above reductive calcination experiment is shown in Scheme S1."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Zeiss Oberkochen, Germany) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, JEM-2010F, JEOL, Japan) were used to observe the morphology of as-prepared products. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, D8 ADVANC, Germany) using a CuKα with a Ni filter (40 kV, 40 mA) was used to confirm the phases of the as-prepared samples. The chemical states of the as-prepared products were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, JEOL, JPS-9010MCY). The specific surface areas of the as-prepared samples were characterized using N2 adsorption at −196 °C on a specific surface area and porosity analyser (Micromeritics, TRYSTAR 3000, Japan). The band energy information of the as-prepared samples was measured by UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (Shimadzu, UV-2400PC/2500 PC, Japan)."
5,Photocatalytic reaction,"2.4 Photocatalytic reaction A photocatalytic reactor was used in this study as shown in Scheme S2. Xe lamp (500 W, 300 < λ < 600 nm, light intensity 600 μW∙cm−2) was located in the centre of the photocatalytic reactor along the axis and protected by a water-cooled quartz jacket. A magnetic stirrer at the bottom of the reactor was used to achieve effective dispersion by mechanical agitation. A circular test tube rack was inserted in the thermostatic bath to hold up the Pyrex glass tubes. Thus, the visible light (equipped with cutoff filter (L42, Hoya) between the Xe lamp and Pyrex glass tubes was collected into the glass tube and ensured that the photocatalytic reaction occurred uniformly and completely. The reactor was fitted with a magnetic stirrer for stirring at 700 rpm to keep the catalyst in suspension. For the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol, the as-prepared photocatalysts (150 mg) were added in aerated aqueous benzyl alcohol (100 mL, initial amount 130 μmol). The reaction cell was tightly sealed with a rubber cap and then was irradiated by the Xe lamp equipped with a cutoff filter (L42, Hoya). Sample aliquots were taken out of the reactor cell at given irradiation time intervals and then centrifuged for analysis. Sample analysis was carried out by Gas Chromatography (GC7890II, Techcomp) equipped with a Flame Ionization Detector (FID) for the quantitative identiﬁcation of benzyl alcohol and product concentration in solution. The released CO2 was measured using a gas chromatograph (Align model GC-6890 N) equipped with a 2 m Porapak-Q column, a methanizer, and a flame ionization detector, using N2 as the carrier gas. Oxalic acid(C2H2O4) and isopropanol were added to the photocatalytic oxidation system in order to capture the active species holes and •OH in the oxidation process of benzyl alcohol [44,45]. The conversion efficiency is defined as the molar percentage of consumed reactant, while the selectivity of the desired product is determined as the molar percentage of the desired product out of total products. The conversion of benzyl alcohol and the selectivity for benzaldehyde were defined as follow: Conversion rate (%)=(C0-CBA)/C0 × 100; Selectivity (%) = CBDA/(C0-CBA) × 100.Where C0 is the initial concentration of benzyl alcohol and CBA and CBAD are the concentration of the substrate benzyl alcohol and the corresponding benzaldehyde, respectively."
6,Method of calculation,"2.5 Method of calculation DFT calculations were carried out using a plane-wave-based programme, Castep [46,47]. The Perdew−Burke−Ernzerhof functional [48,49] was used together with the ultrasoft-core potentials [50]. Semi-empirical dispersion interaction correction was included based on McNellis et al. [51]. The basis set cut-off energy was set to 300 and 340 eV for geometry optimization and post-energy evaluation. Explicitly considered electrons are H: 1s1, C: 2s22p2, N: 2s22p3, O: 2s22p4, and W: 5s25p65d46s2. Among materials consisting of NH4 and WO3 units, a structure with hexagonal symmetry was adopted (ICSD #23537). The space group is P 63/mcm, and the lattice constants are a = b = 7.388 Å, c = 7.551 Å, α = β = 90° and γ = 60°. To make slab models, the direction along the c-axis was cleaved. The lattice constant was set to c = 30 Å, including the vacuum region. In calculations of the catalytic reaction, all the atomic coordinates were optimized, and the lattice constants were fixed as the original values."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Structure and morphology,"3.1 Structure and morphology Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared samples obtained from the solvothermal reaction without adding thiourea and PdCl2 (a, b) as well as in the presence of thiourea and PdCl2 (c, d). The product obtained in the absence of thiourea before calcination (Fig. 1a) was identified as monoclinic W18O49 (JCPDS Card No. 05-0392) with diffraction peaks of the (010) and (020) planes, respectively. After air calcination, the monoclinic W18O49 totally converted into monoclinic WO3 (JCPDS Card No. 43-1035) with the characteristic diffraction peaks of the (001), (120), (220), (221) and (140) planes, shown in Fig. 1b. While in the presence of thoiurea and PdCl2, the XRD pattern of the as-obtained product before calcination (Fig. 1c) shows the coexistence of the monoclinic W18O49 and hexagonal (NH4)xWO3 (JCPDS Card No. 42-0452) with diffraction peaks of (101), (002), (200), (202) and (220). After calcination under a reductive atmosphere for 1 h, the XRD pattern in Fig. 1d matched the main mixed phases of the monoclinic WO3 and (NH4)xWO3, suggesting the monoclinic W18O49 and a part of (NH4)xWO3 (based on the intensity of their characteristic peaks) were transformed into monoclinic WO3. Meanwhile, a small peak appeared at 40.21°, which was indexed the face-centered cubic (fcc) phase of Pd (Fig. 1d). Based on the above results, thiourea was involved in the reaction, leading to the formation of the (NH4)xWO3 phase. We further investigated the effect of the addition amount of thiourea on the phase formation of the final products after reductive calcination. As shown in Fig. S1, the products with mixed phases can only form when the added amount of thiourea is low. With increasing the amount of thiourea in the solvothermal reaction, the (NH4)xWO3 phase increased first and then decreased and finally was not generated for a high addition amount. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) was carried out to examine the chemical compositions and their corresponding valence states for Pd-loaded (NH4)xWO3/WO3. In Fig. 2 a, the fully scanned spectrum shows the presence of Pd, N, W, O and C in the measured sample. The peak of C in the sample may originate from the carbon tape. The XPS peak of N1s (Fig. 2b) located at 402.1 eV comes from the NH4+ group in (NH4)xWO3. For tungsten, the corresponding W 4f core level XPS spectrum of Pd-loaded (NH4)xWO3/WO3 is shown in Fig. 2c. After deconvolution, the W 4f core level spectra were well fitted into two spin-orbit doublets groups which corresponded to two different oxidation states of W atoms. The main peaks located at 35.4 eV and 37.5 eV are assigned to W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 of W6+, respectively. The lower binding energies of 34.2 eV and 36.3 eV in the second doublet could be assigned to W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 of W5+, respectively. These results regarding the W 4f core level are consistent with the typical nature of tungsten bronze (MxW6+ 1-xW5+ xO3). In contrast, only one group of spin-orbit doublets in a hexavalent oxidation state was fitted in the W 4f core level spectrum from the monoclinic WO3 after air calcination (Fig. S2). The high-resolution XPS spectrum (Fig. 2d) of Pd 3d is dominated by two components. The main peaks located at 335.5 eV and 340.6 eV are assigned to Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2 of the metallic Pd0 state, respectively. The higher binding energies of 336.7 eV and 341.8 eV in the second doublet could be assigned to Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2 of PdO, respectively. Therefore, the states of Pd species on the surface of the as-prepared product under a CO-containing atmosphere were found to be dominantly the metallic Pd0 state with a relatively low amount of the oxide state also judging from the peak position in reference to Pd and PdO (Fig. 2d). Based on the above results, we can determine the chemical composition of the synthesized product as Pd-loaded (NH4)xWO3/WO3. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images and transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of Pd-loaded (NH4)xWO3/WO3 obtained after reductive calcination are shown in Fig. 3 . The Pd-loaded urchin-shaped (NH4)xWO3/WO3 microspheres were observed in Fig. 3a. These microspheres had diameters in the range of 1–3 μm and were interconnected to each other. The high-magnification SEM (Fig. 3b and c) images show that each urchin-like microsphere was assembled by nanorods with diameters of ca. 50 nm. These nanorods radiated from the centre of the sphere, giving them an urchin-shaped structure. In this process, thioureas typically exist in solution as trans-cis rotamer [52]. It can function as a hydrogen-bond acceptor through the lone pairs of the C=S group or act as a hydrogen-bond donor through its two NH protons. Meanwhile, WCl6 can generate protons during its alcoholysis process. These protons may adsorb on the as-prepared nanoparticle surfaces during the growth process and have an interaction with thiourea. With their stong and predictable hydrogen-bonding, N, N′-disubstituted thiourea are robust and versatile groups that can be rationally employed for the synthesis of crystalline solids with three-dimensional urchin-like frameworks. Meanwhile, thiourea used as an ammonium source participates in the crystal growth, thereby tuning the unique morphology and forming the multicomponent nature of the final products. In contrast, the pure WO3 obtained in the absence of thiourea and PdCl2 showed the scattered nanorod-like structure in Fig. S3a, which is the same as the results from previous report of Choi et al. [42]. These results clearly indicate that the introduction of thiourea has a significant effect on the morphological evolution. More details of the nanostructural characteristics of the as-prepared Pd-loaded urchin-like (NH4)xWO3/WO3 particles were studied by TEM measurements. Fig. 3d gives the TEM image of an intercrossed urchin-like (NH4)xWO3/WO3, also showing that numerous nanorods grew pointing towards the centre of the sphere. From the TEM image of an individual nanorod in Fig. 3e, we can see that the (NH4)xWO3/WO3 nanorod has the typical diameter of ca. 50 nm. Meanwhile, this nanorod was covered with a uniform distribution of ∼10 nm Pd nanoparticles. With clear observation from a HRTEM image taken from a part of the nanorod shown in Fig. 3f, the nanorod was confirmed to be polycrystalline. The lattice fringes were calculated to be approximately 0.38 nm and 0.64 nm, corresponding to the (100) and (001) planes of spinel-structured monoclinic WO3 and (NH4)xWO3, respectively. The lattice fringes of Pd nanoparticles ca. 0.46 nm corresponding Pd (111) plane was marked in HRTEM image as shown in Fig. S3b. The thermal behavior of Pd-loaded (NH4)xWO3/WO3 obtained in the presence of thiourea (380 mg) and Pd (0.5 wt%) under reductive conditions is difficult to determine directly. Herein, we tried to measure the change in the mass of Pd-loaded (NH4)xWO3/WO3 by TGA to estimate the thermostability in samples. Fig. 4 showed that the weight loss of (NH4)xWO3/monoclinic W18O49 from room temperature to 100 °C and up to approximately 230 °C could be attributed to the loss of surface-adsorbed water and structural water, respectively. After that, the weight loss in the range of 230–550 °C can be explained by the decomposition of (NH4)xWO3 and W18O49. There is almost no weight loss above 550 °C. In addition, the final product after the TG measurement was indexed as a monoclinic WO3 crystal as measured by XRD (data no shown), indicating the complete decomposition of (NH4)xWO3 into WO3 upon calcination at high temperature. Fig. 5 shows the diffuse reﬂectance UV-vis absorption spectra of the photocatalysts. The Pd-loaded (NH4)xWO3/WO3 showed increased absorbance above 400 nm compared to the product before calcination due to the light scattering by the Pd nanoparticles. The PdO/(NH4)xWO3/W18O49 and Pd-loaded (NH4)xWO3/WO3 showed bathochromic shift compared to the WO3 due to the mixed chemical valence tungsten ions (W6+ and W5+) which exhibited excellent visible absorption properties [53]. The bandgap of Pd-loaded (NH4)xWO3/WO3 was calculated to be 2.5 eV (inset), suggesting that the as-prepared product can respond effectively above 400 nm in the visible light range."
9,Photocatalytic activity,"3.2 Photocatalytic activity Fig. 6 shows the photocatalytic conversion process of benzyl alcohol over a Pd/(NH4)xWO3/WO3 sample in an aerated aqueous benzyl alcohol (PhCH2OH) solution under visible light illumination (420 < λ < 600 nm). At the initial stage of light illumination, the amount of benzyl alcohol gradually decreased with benzaldehyde (PhCHO) production in the solution. The benzaldehyde increased with a relatively steady generation rate and, after illumination for 9 h, the generation of benzaldehyde tended to be saturated. It is interesting to observe that the concentration of benzaldehyde was not significantly reduced in a longer period of irradiation (up to 18 h), and the production of CO2 was negligible and out of the range of detection. On the basis of the amount of benzyl alcohol consumed in the initial period (3 h), the selectivity for benzaldehyde was calculated to be 80% for the Pd (0.5 wt%)/(NH4)xWO3/WO3 photocatalyst when benzyl alcohol was at a low conversion of 27%. Extending the time of light irradiation up to 18 h, the conversion percentage of benzyl alcohol reached up to 84%, and the selectivity for benzaldehyde was still high (ca. 80%). In contrast, the selectivity for benzaldehyde production (58%) at the conversion (66%) of benzyl alcohol over Pd (0.5 wt %)/WO3 nanorods after light irradiation of 18 h is shown in Fig. S4a. However, in the absence of Pd loading, much lower conversion of benzyl alcohol over (NH4)xWO3/WO3 (Fig. S4b) and WO3 nanorods (Fig. S4a) was observed, suggesting the enhanced effect of Pd cocatalysts on the conversion of benzyl alcohol."
10,Mechanism and discussion,"3.3 Mechanism and discussion Here, we propose an explanation of the relatively high selectivity for benzaldehyde production from the conversion of benzyl alcohol in the aqueous solution over Pd/(NH4)xWO3/WO3 under visible light irradiation. It has been reported that the Pd/WO3 system showed high photocatalytic activity towards gaseous organic pollutants, including aldehydes and ketones, resulting in the complete decomposition of the gaseous organic molecules into CO2 due to the activity of the Pd cocatalyst [30]. This means that Pd/(NH4)xWO3/WO3 should have intrinsic oxidation capacity of benzaldehyde to CO2, but the activity was largely reduced in aqueous media. It is thus that one of the possible reasons why Pd/(NH4)xWO3/WO3 became inert in aqueous solution accompanied by the high selectivity of benzaldehyde production might be the shielding of the activity of Pd nanoparticles by the generated benzaldehyde molecules adsorbed to the Pd surface. To verify this, we investigated the photocatalytic oxidation of the initial mixed solution containing benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde over the Pd/(NH4)xWO3/WO3 photocatalyst, as shown in Fig. S5. The initial presence of benzaldehyde did not affect the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol, which was almost the same rate as that in the absence of benzaldehyde. This indicated that Pd cocatalyst-induced O2 reduction was not suppressed by the presence of benzaldehyde in the solution. Otherwise, the high selectivity of benzaldehyde production from the high conversion of benzyl alcohol could not be obtained because the rapid recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes would occur, leading to the low activity of the Pd/(NH4)xWO3/WO3 photocatalyst. Therefore, we infer that the relatively high selectivity of benzaldehyde production could be attributed to the results of the balance between the active species produced by the photogenerated holes on the photocatalyst surface and the active species produced by O2 reduction on the Pd surface. It has been extensively reported that the photocatalytic oxidation reaction of organic compounds on semiconductor photocatalysts proceeds by the following two main ways: the first is the direct oxidation by the photoexcited holes (h+) on the photocatalyst surface; another is the indirect oxidation by the generated active oxygen species, including •OH radicals, •O2− radicals or HO2• radicals. These are generated following Eqs. (1)–(3), respectively: (1) H2O + h+→H+ + •OH (2) O2+e−→•O2− (3) O2+H++e−→HO2• We noticed that the TiO2 photocatalyst is seldom used in the conversion of alcohols unless the photocatalyst system is precisely designed for this purpose. This is because sequential oxidation is prone to occur by the strong oxidation of the photogenerated holes and thus reduces the selectivity of the desired products. However, in the present case, the affinity of the WO3 surface for organic compounds is much lower than that of TiO2 [54], which reasonably may reduce the possibility of direct oxidation of the desired products by photoexcited holes. As evidenced in Fig. S5, benzaldehyde was selectively generated over Pd/(NH4)xWO3/WO3 without releasing CO2 even when benzaldehyde reached a high concentration, indicating that the direct oxidation by the photoexcited holes did not occur on the surface of the Pd/(NH4)xWO3/WO3 photocatalyst. It is thus that the initial reaction started mainly by the indirect oxidation of •OH radicals or other active oxygen species (•O2− or HO2•). On the other hand, since the minimum value of the WO3 conduction band (approximately 0.3–0.5 V vs. NHE) is much lower than the O2 reduction potential by the single electron reduction process, the generation of HO2• and •O2− can thus be excluded in this study, which are generally produced through one-electron reduction processes. Therefore, at the initiation reaction, the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol by •OH radicals produced by the reaction of water molecules with the photogenerated holes was dominant. Meanwhile, based on the results of the preferential oxidation test of the mixed solution containing benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde, as shown in Fig. S5, the lower activity of •OH radicals with respect to benzaldehyde than benzyl alcohol was demonstrated. This may be responsible for the high selectivity of benzaldehyde production from the high conversion of benzyl alcohol in the initial stage of light irradiation. However, with extended irradiation time, when most of benzyl alcohol was consumed, the generated benzaldehyde may be further oxidized by the formed •OH radicals due to their strong oxidation ability. Conversely, the selectivity for benzaldehyde was still high (ca. 80%) at the conversion percentage of benzyl alcohol of 84% after light irradiation for 18 h (Fig. S5). Therefore, the formation of ∙OH radicals by photo-generated holes may be inhibited when benzyl alcohol achieves high conversion. A series of active species trapping experiments were carried out under the above mentioned photocatalytic experimental conditions by the addition of oxalic acid (OA) as hole scavengers and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) as •OH scavengers in the solution. As shown in Fig. S6, when OA and IPA were respectively added to the benzyl alcohol system to trap the holes and •OH. The conversion of benzyl alcohol decreased significantly, revealing that the photogenerated holes and •OH are the major oxidative species for the present photocatalytic oxidation reaction since photogenerated holes indirectly oxidized benzyl alcohol through •OH. DFT calculations were carried out to study the reaction of benzyl alcohol and •OH radicals. To accurately simulate the reaction mechanism of the composite (NH4)xWO3/WO3 photocatalyst, a (NH4)2(WO3)9(OH)2 model was employed. The reason for choosing the (NH4)2(WO3)9(OH)2 model is demonstrated in Fig. S7 and Fig. S8. All the atomic coordinates were optimized, and the lattice constants were fixed to the original values. Fig. S9 shows the optimized structures for HOOH adsorption onto (NH4)2(WO3)9(OH)2 in the singlet state (left) and in the triplet state (right). The O-O bond of HOOH is slightly stretched, and HOOH is loosely bonded to the W atom in the triplet state compared to the singlet state. This suggests that photo irradiation favours generating •OH species. To gain more insights into the reaction mechanism, the reaction of benzyl alcohol and HOOH was further investigated and compared between the singlet and triplet potential energy surfaces (PES), as shown in Fig. 7 . The optimized structures for the co-adsorption of HOOH and PhCH2OH on the (NH4)2(WO3)9(OH)2 unit cell, first transition state (TS1) for PhCH2OH + HOOH → PhCH2O + H2O + •OH reaction, and the intermediate composed of PhCH2O, H2O and •OH in the singlet state are shown in Fig. 7a-c, respectively. The acidic proton of PhCH2O-H was first eliminated by •OH from HOOH, and H2O was generated. Meanwhile, Fig. 7(d–f) show the corresponding optimized structures in the triplet state. By comparison, the difference in structures seems small between the singlet and triplet states. However, the difference in energetics was more significant, as shown in Fig. 7g. Medium level optimization energy and fine level energy determined by the post calculation behave in parallel. In the reaction of PhCH2OH + HOOH → PhCH2O + H2O + •OH, there is an energy barrier for the singlet PES. However, if excited to the triplet state by photo irradiation, the energy barrier disappeared, suggesting a favourable (downhill) reaction for PhCH2OH + HOOH → PhCH2O + H2O + •OH. This change between the singlet and triplet states, which has not yet been observed in other photocatalyst systems, clearly demonstrates the advantage of our designed photocatalyst. Fig. S10 shows the optimized structures for the second TS (TS2) for the PHCH2O +∙OH →PhCHO + H2O reaction and for the product (PhCHO and 2H2O). This latter half reaction was investigated on the singlet PES since quenching seems to occur during the former half reaction (PhCH2OH + HOOH →PhCH2O + H2O + •OH). DFT calculations are highly consistent with the experimental results and clearly demonstrate the reaction mechanism between PhCH2OH and •OH radicals. It has been previously elucidated that the presence of a nanoscale Pd cocatalyst on WO3 facilitated the multielectron O2 reduction by photogenerated electrons (O2 + 2H+ +2e− → H2O2, +0.682 V) as well as Pt [55]. During the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol over the Pd/(NH4)xWO3/WO3, H2O2 began to form via the reaction between the accumulated photogenerated electrons on the Pd surface and dissolved O2 molecules. In the Pt/WO3 system, active Pt metal worked as an electron magnet, as reported by Abe et al. [30] The produced H2O2 was quickly decomposed according to Eq. (4) because H2O2 acted as an efficient electron scavenger. (4) H2O2 + 2H+ +2e−→2H2O, +1.76V This therefore increased the amounts of photoexcited holes, leading to direct oxidation of organic compounds by holes on the WO3 surface [53]. However, Pd showed much lower activity than Pt [56]. Therefore, compared to the H2O2 decomposition in Pt-loaded WO3, the accumulation of H2O2 generated by multielectron O2 reduction on Pd/(NH4)xWO3/WO3 seemed to be reasonable due to the low activity of Pd. This can be demonstrated by the initial photocatalytic reaction of the solution of benzaldehyde and H2O2 over Pd/(NH4)xWO3/WO3 in Fig. S11. H2O2 addition only slightly affected the reaction on Pd/(NH4)xWO3/WO3. This result demonstrated that the photocatalyst generated H2O2 in the process and benzyl alcohol oxidation consumed the H2O2. It is also well known that H2O2 molecules can react with holes in certain photocatalytic processes by Eq. (5). (5) H2O2 + 2h+ → O2 + 2H+ Thus, with prolonged reaction time, the photogenerated holes were preferentially consumed by a portion of the H2O2 produced by the multielectron O2 reduction on Pd cocatalyst to release O2. This therefore decreased the rate of •OH production from H2O molecules, consequently keeping high selectivity for benzaldehyde until the maximum conversion of benzyl alcohol. The effect of Pd loading amount on the conversion of benzyl alcohol and the selectivity for benzaldehyde production was also investigated. When the Pd loading amount on (NH4)xWO3/WO3 was increased from 0.1, 0.5 to 1 wt %, the conversion percentages of benzyl alcohol increased (63%, 84% and 86%) at the initial irradiation of 9 h. However, the corresponding selectivity for benzaldehyde production (85%, 80%, 76%) decreased slightly when the Pd loading amount increased. This demonstrated that the increasing amount of Pd loading effectively promoted O2 reduction by the multi-electron reaction, thereby increasing the oxidation rate of benzyl alcohol. However, with the increase of the Pd loading amount, the selectivity of benzaldehyde production in the high conversion of benzyl alcohol decreased, indicating that the rate of photoexcited holes increased, and a certain degree of undesirable benzaldehyde peroxidation was induced. Finally, the reusability and stability of the used photocatalysts were investigated. The almost unaffected conversion of benzyl alcohol and selectivity of benzaldehyde production obtained under visible light irradiation of 18 h after five cycles as shown in Fig. S12, suggesting the good reusability of Pd/(NH4)xWO3/WO3. In addition, the morphology of photocatalyst after five reuse cycles still maintained the urchin-like structure (Fig. S13), showing good stability of the as-prepared photocatalysts. Therefore, we would like to make the following conclusions regarding the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol over Pd/(NH4)xWO3/WO3 in Fig. 8 : at the initiation of the reaction, the photoexcited holes preferentially participated in an oxidation reaction with water molecules, and •OH radicals were generated. The generated •OH radicals preferentially attacked benzyl alcohol due to the inert reactivity of the (NH4)xWO3/WO3 catalyst surface, leading to a stable rate of benzaldehyde production without releasing CO2 until the max conversion percentage of benzyl alcohol. Meanwhile, the photogenerated electrons were consumed via multielectron O2 reduction on Pd to form H2O2. However, along with the amount of benzaldehyde reached at the maximum, some accumulated H2O2 began to be consumed by holes due to the lower activity of the Pd cocatalyst than Pt. When reaching the max amount of benzaldehyde, the photogenerated h+ preferentially was consumed by H2O2 into O2; meanwhile, the photogenerated electrons reacted with O2 to generate H2O2. Thus, such a cycle of reaction between H2O2 and O2 largely suppressed the peroxidation of benzaldehyde to CO2, resulting in benzaldehyde generation from benzyl alcohol with relatively high selectivity. Finally, we believe that the merits of the 3D hierarchical nanostructure with a mixed phase of Pd/(NH4)xWO3/WO3 increased the rate of photocatalytic conversion of benzyl alcohol compared to that over the Pd/WO3 nanorods, as shown in Fig. S4."
11,Conclusion,"We have successfully prepared Pd-loaded urchin-like (NH4)xWO3/WO3 with a 3D nanostructure and mixed phases through the thiourea-assisted alcoholysis of WCl6 and PdCl2 and subsequent reductive heat treatment. The presence of the thiourea played a critical role in the morphologic evolution and composition of the final product. In comparison to Pd/WO3 nanorods, the Pd-loaded (NH4)xWO3/WO3 exhibited relatively high selectivity for the partial conversion of benzyl alcohol to the corresponding benzaldehyde in aqueous solution containing O2 as the oxidant under visible light irradiation. The high conversion of benzyl alcohol and relatively high selectivity of benzaldehyde production were attributed to the affinity of Pd/(NH4)xWO3/WO3 towards organic compounds being relatively low on the surface, leading to the initially selective conversion of the benzyl alcohol by •OH radicals. Meanwhile, the accumulated H2O2 proceeded through a two-electron O2 reduction by the Pd species due to its relatively low activity. When the max amount of benzaldehyde was achieved, the accumulated H2O2 began to consume the generated holes on the photocatalysts, thus suppressing the peroxidation of the benzaldehyde. Moreover, the 3D nanostructure of the Pd-loaded (NH4)xWO3/WO3 also increased the oxidation reaction rate of benzyl alcohol compared to that over the Pd/WO3 nanorods."
