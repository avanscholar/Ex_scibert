0,Introduction,"Dietary phenolic compounds, abundantly present in vegetables and fruits, have been shown to possess preventive activities toward chronic-degenerative diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer (Kris-Etherton et al., 2002). In the case of cancer, these compounds are believed to inhibit the carcinogenic process at the initiation stage by reducing the oxidative DNA damage through their free radical scavenger activity (Fernandez-Penchon, Villano, Troncoso, & Garcia-Parrilla, 2008). However, phenols are also able to slow down the cancer promotion/progression by the interaction with different intracellular targets resulting in the inhibition of proliferation and the induction of apoptosis in tumour cells (Aggarwal & Shishodia, 2006). Olive oil contains different phenolic compounds represented by phenolic acids, phenolic alcohols, flavonoids, secoiridoids and lignans (Servili & Montedoro, 2002). Among the phenolic alcohols, hydroxytyrosol [3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol (3,4-DHPEA)] and tyrosol [p-hydroxyphenyl ethanol (p-HPEA)] are abundantly present in olive oil as both free compounds and linked to the dialdehydic form of elenolic acid, giving rise to the main secoiridois derivatives 3,4-DHPEA-EDA and p-HPEA-EDA, respectively (Fig. 1 ) (Servili & Montedoro, 2002). It is noteworthy that 3,4-DHPEA, p-HPEA and their secoiridoid derivatives, which include also oleuropein (Fig. 1), oleuropein aglycon and ligstroside aglycon, are exclusively present in olive oil (Servili & Montedoro, 2002). In the last few years, 3,4-DHPEA has been the subject of a considerable interest being deeply studied because of its strong antioxidant activity (for review see Fitò et al., 2007; Visioli, Poli, & Galli, 2002; Waterman & Lockwood, 2007). Indeed, this compound is able to efficiently prevent the hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA damage in a low concentration range (1–10μM) (Fabiani et al., 2008). However, at high concentrations (100–400μM) 3,4-DHPEA is able to induce apoptosis on different human cancer cells, such as colon carcinoma, melanoma and leukaemia HL60 cells (D’Angelo et al., 2005; Fabiani et al., 2002; Guichard et al., 2006). Interestingly, we have recently demonstrated that 3,4-DHPEA at 100μM induces apoptosis on HL60 cells through an oxidative stress represented by the extracellular production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (Fabiani, Fuccelli, Pieravanti, De Bartolomeo, & Morozzi, 2009). In fact, the apoptotic effect of 3,4-DHPEA was effectively inhibited by N-acetyl-cysteine, dietary antioxidants (ascorbate and α-tocopherol), and the enzyme catalase (Fabiani et al., 2009). The aim of this study was to assess the ability of different phenolic compounds, mainly present in the olive oil (Fig. 1) and/or structurally similar to 3,4-DHPEA (Fig. 2 ), to produce extracellular H2O2 and to induce apoptosis in HL60 cells. The involvement of H2O2 in the phenol-mediated apoptosis induction has also been investigated."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials and cell culture,"2.1 Materials and cell culture RPMI 1640 medium and heat-inactivated foetal calf serum (FCS) were obtained from Gibco (Gibco BRL, Life Technologies, Paisley, Scotland). 3,4-DHPEA was obtained from Cayman Chemicals Ltd. (1180 East Ellsworth Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48108, United States), supplied as ethanol solution at a concentration of 320mM. Protocatechuic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, 3,4-dihydroxy-hydrocinnamic acid (3,4-DHHC), o-coumaric acid and syringic acid were obtained from Fluka Chemie AG (Industriestrasse 25, Buchs CH-9471, Switzerland). Gallic acid was from Carlo Erba (Milano, Italy), while oleuropein was purchased by Extrasynthese (Genay, France). 3,4-DHPEA-EDA and p-HPEA-EDA were purified by semi-preparative HPLC from a methanolic extract obtained from a virgin olive oil containing 650mg/kg of total phenols, as previously reported (Fabiani et al., 2006; Montedoro, Servili, Baldioli, & Miniati, 1992). The purity of the preparations was evaluated by HPLC and confirmed by NMR (Montedoro et al., 1993). The compounds were stored at −20°C in the dark and were diluted to the desired concentrations in RPMI 1640 medium just before use. All the solutions were sterilised by filtration on 0.22μm filters (Celbio S.r.l., Milan, Italy). p-HPEA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic (3,4-DHPA), homovanillic acid, homovanillic alcohol, dopamine and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless differently specified (Sigma–Aldrich Co. Ltd., Irvine, UK). Human promyelocytic leukaemia cells (HL60), obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA), were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 2.0mM l-glutamine, 100U/ml penicillin and 100U/ml streptomycin. The cells were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere and seeded every 4days at a density of 0.2×106/ml."
3,Cell treatment and apoptosis assays,"2.2 Cell treatment and apoptosis assays HL60 cells were seeded at a density of 0.2×106/ml in complete RPMI 1640 medium into six well flat bottom plates (Falcon; Becton Dickinson, Oxnard, CA, USA), and incubated for 24h at 37°C and 5% CO2 with the different phenolic compounds (100μM) in the absence and in the presence of catalase (CAT: 100U/ml). The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by a fluorescent microscopy assay. The cell suspensions (100μl) were centrifuged (400g, 7min) and the pellets were resuspended in complete RPMI medium containing the DNA binding dyes Hoechst 33342 (HO 342, 20μg/ml in PBS) and propidium iodide (PI, 10μg/ml in PBS). After 10min of incubation at room temperature, the cells were examined using a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss, R.G., equipped with a 50-W mercury lamp) with ultraviolet excitation at 340–380nm. HO 342 is a plasma membrane – permeable compound, which freely enters the cells with intact membranes, as well as cells with damaged membranes, and stains the DNA blue, whereas PI is a highly polar dye that is impermeable to cells with intact plasma membrane and stains the DNA red. Consequently, the viable cells have been identified by their intact nuclei with blue fluorescence (HO 342), and the necrotic cells by their intact nuclei with yellow fluorescence (HO 342 plus PI). Apoptotic cells were detected by their fragmented nuclei which exhibited either a blue (HO 342) or yellow (HO 342 plus PI) fluorescence, depending on the stage of the process. Under each of the experimental condition, three slides were prepared, and 100 cells were counted for each slide. In some experiments apoptosis was also evaluated by propidium iodide (PI) – staining and flow cytometry. In this case, the cell pellet was resuspended in 0.5ml of hypotonic fluorochrome solution (50μg/ml PI in 0.1% sodium citrate plus 0.1% Triton X-100) in 12×75mm polypropylene tubes (Becton and Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ, USA). The tubes were kept at 4°C for 30min before flow cytometric analysis. The PI fluorescence of individual nuclei was measured using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA, USA) at a wavelength of 488nm. In addition, the externalisation of phosphatidylserine, which is an early event during the apoptotic process, was evidenced by the annexin V-FITC kit (Beckman Coulter, Instrumentation Laboratory, Milano, Italy) according to the manufacturer’s indications. Briefly, the HL60 cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold PBS and the pellet was resuspended in binding buffer to 2×106 cells/ml. Annexin-V-FICT (1–100μl) and PI (5–100μl) were added, the samples were incubated on ice in the dark for 15min, and then analysed by flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter)."
4,Measurement of H2O2 concentration in the culture medium,"2.3 Measurement of H2O2 concentration in the culture medium The concentration of H2O2 in the culture medium was measured by the ferrous ion oxidation-xylenol orange method (Nourooz-Zadeh, Tajaddini-Sarmadi, & Wolff, 1994) as follows: medium (20μl) was mixed with a reaction solution (200μl) containing 250μM ammonium iron(II) sulphate, 25mM H2SO4, 100mM sorbitol and 125μM xylenol orange and incubated at room temperature for 30min. The absorbance was then read at 595nm, and the concentration of H2O2 was derived from a standard curve obtained by adding different concentrations of H2O2 in the RPMI medium just before the assay."
5,Statistical analysis,"2.4 Statistical analysis All tests were run in triplicate for each experimental condition, and each experiment was repeated at least three times; the results are reported as the mean±SD. Significant differences among treatments were assessed using a one-way ANOVA. When a significant (p <0.05) treatment effect was detected, the mean values were compared using Tukey’s post hoc comparisons. The effects of CAT on H2O2 accumulation (Table 1 ) and apoptosis (Table 2 ) were compared with Student’s t-test."
6,Results,"To test the ability of olive oil phenols to produce H2O2, these compounds were preliminarily incubated in RPMI medium (without FCS and HL60 cells) at 100μM for 24h and then the H2O2 concentration in the medium was measured by the xylenol orange method (Table 1). The phenols tested were selected, besides being present in olive oil, because they are structurally similar to 3,4-DHPEA and, in the case of homovanillic acid, homovanillic alcohol and 3,4-DHPA, because they are also important metabolites of 3,4-DHPEA (D’Angelo et al., 2001; Tuck, Hayball, & Stupans, 2002). It is clear that 3,4-DHPEA and its derivatives 3,4-DHPEA-EDA and oleuropein cause the accumulation of H2O2 in the culture medium, while p-HPEA and p-HPEA-EDA have not such an effect (Table 1, left column). These results suggest that (i) the two hydroxyl groups in ortho-position are indispensable for this activity and (ii) the substitution of the hydrogen atom of the ethanol hydroxyl group with a larger molecule, although reducing the H2O2 accumulation, does not eliminate this effect. The comparison of the H2O2-producing activity of the other phenolic compounds with 3,4-DHPEA indicates that substitution of the alcoholic group of 3,4-DHPEA with either an acid (3,4-DHPA) or an aminic (dopamine) group did not reduce the H2O2 accumulation. In addition, the importance of the catechol structure for both 3,4-DHPEA and 3,4-DHPA to induce H2O2 accumulation is further demonstrated by the observation that their O-methylated derivatives, respectively, homovanillic alcohol and homovanillic acid, completely lack this activity. On the other hand, protocatechuic acid and caffeic acid, even if possessing the catechol structure, produce low and statistically not significant amounts of H2O2. Instead, gallic acid which is a 2-hydroxy-protocatechuic acid releases high amounts of H2O2, while the methyl derivative of gallic acid (syringic acid) has no effect. The presence of the HL60 cells (0.2×106/ml) drastically reduced the accumulation of H2O2 in the culture medium (Table 1, central column), indicating that these cells efficiently metabolise H2O2. However, for some compounds (3,4-DHPEA, 3,4-DHPEA-EDA, 3,4-DHPA, 3,4-DHHC, dopamine and gallic acid), a significant higher amount of H2O2, when compared to the control, remains in the culture medium which is completely removed by the presence of catalase (Table 1, right column). In addition, for these last compounds a significant correlation is evident between the concentration of H2O2 produced in the absence and that accumulated in the presence of HL60 cells (Fig. 3 ). One exception is represented by gallic acid which, although is able to produce high amount of H2O2 in the absence of cells, causes a low accumulation of H2O2 in the presence of HL60 cells (Fig. 3). To throw light upon this last aspect we evaluated the production of H2O2 by some compounds as a function of time, either in the absence (Fig. 4 A) or in the presence (Fig. 4B) of HL60 cells. The results show that gallic acid is the most active compound, inducing in the absence of cells the maximum accumulation of H2O2 in a short time (about 100μM after 6h of incubation); 3,4-DHPEA and 3,4-DHHC reached the same effect after 24 and 48h, respectively. The plateau of H2O2 concentration observed, equimolar to that of the phenols used (100μM), suggest that these compounds undergo a chemical modification with the consequent production of H2O2 but do not induce cycling reactions. Worth of note is also the different behaviour of gallic acid in the presence of HL60 cells; in fact, it induces a sharp increase of H2O2 concentration reaching the maximum (30μM) after 1h of incubation, while with all other compounds the H2O2 concentration never exceeded 5μM (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that the low amount of H2O2 found in the presence of cells after 24h of treatment with gallic acid is due to the initial fast production of H2O2, which stops after 6h making it possible the efficient removal of H2O2 by the HL60 cells. In order to investigate whether the H2O2-producing activity is a mechanism by which the phenols induce apoptosis, the HL60 cells were incubated with the different compounds and then the nuclear fragmentation, an hallmark of apoptosis, was determined by fluorescence microscopy (Table 2, left column), and the correlation between the H2O2-producing activity and the pro-apoptotic effect of the phenols was studied (Fig. 5 ). These results indicate that for some compounds a clear relationship exists between the H2O2-producing activity and their pro-apoptotic effect. Indeed, two clusters are evident, the first, on the left down corner, includes compounds that are not able to both produce H2O2 and induce apoptosis, and the second, on the right up corner, includes compounds (3,4-DHPEA, 3,4-DHPA, 3,4-DHHC, dopamine and gallic acid) that produces high amounts of H2O2 together with high levels of apoptosis (Fig. 5). Caffeic acid is in between the two clusters. The involvement of H2O2 in the pro-apoptotic mechanism of these last compounds is further confirmed by the inhibitory effect on apoptosis exerted by catalase (Table 2, right column). In contrast, three compounds seem to break this rule, one is p-HPEA-EDA which, even if it does not produce H2O2, induces high level of apoptosis, and the others, 3,4-DHPEA-EDA and oleuropein, that show a higher and lower pro-apoptotic potential than that expected on the basis of H2O2-forming activity, respectively. In these cases, the H2O2 is not involved in the pro-apoptotic mechanisms since catalase does not reduce the effect (Table 2). Finally, it should be noted that catalase does not completely eliminate the pro-apoptotic activity of both dopamine and, to a less extent of 3,4-DHPEA (Table 2), suggesting that these two compounds may in part induce apoptosis by some other mechanisms rather than H2O2 production."
7,Discussion,"The results of the present investigation confirm previous observations showing that most of the pro-apoptotic effect of 3,4-DHPEA is due to extracellular production of H2O2. In addition, it was found that this phenomenon is common to some other phenolic compounds structurally similar to 3,4-DHPEA, either present (caffeic and gallic acids) or not (3,4-DHPA, 3,4-DHHC and dopamine) in olive oil. Furthermore, a different behaviour was evident for other olive oil phenolic compounds, such as protocatechuic, o-coumaric, vanillic, ferulic, syringic acids, which do not induce both apoptosis and H2O2 formation in the culture medium. Interestingly, we found that the esterification of the ethanol hydroxyl group of 3,4-DHPEA with the dialdehydic form of elenolic acid reduced the H2O2 producing activity. This phenomenon could be due to the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bound between the different oxygen groups of elenolic acid with the 4-hydroxyl group of the catechol since the 3,4-DHPEA molecule is not planar and the C–C bound may rotate. An important finding of this study was the observation that the olive oil secoiridoids 3,4-DHPEA-EDA and p-HPEA-EDA induce high level of apoptosis, which was not dependent upon the H2O2 production. Therefore, other pro-apoptotic mechanisms, in which the change in the molecular structure due to the esterification with dialdehydic form of elenolic acid play a central role, may be involved. It should be underlined that in olive oil, these two compounds are about 100 and 10 times more abundant than 3,4-DHPEA and p-HPEA, respectively (Servili & Montedoro, 2002), and for this reason they may significantly influence the cancer preventive activity of olive oil. In addition, the cancer preventive activity of olive oil could be also influenced by the presence of other tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol derivatives, which have been recently isolated from fruits of Olea europea (Bianco et al., 2006), and which can be present in the olive oil mill wastewaters (De Marco, Savarese, Padano, & Sacchi, 2007). Unexpectedly, oleuropein, mainly present in olive fruit, displayed a peculiar effect: although able to release considerable amounts of H2O2, it induces a low level of apoptosis, which was not reduced by catalase. The reasons of this behaviour are at present not known but the low cytotoxicity of this compound has been previously observed in human salivary gland (Babich & Visioli, 2003) and breast cancer cells (Menendez et al., 2007). Although the anticarcinogenic potential of oleuropein has been previously described (Hamdi & Castellon, 2005), to the best of our knowledge, no study has been performed to address both the pro-apoptotic activity of oleuropein and the H2O2-forming ability of olive oil secoiridoids. Instead, the ability of gallic acid, dopamine and caffeic acid to release H2O2 in the culture medium has been previously investigated (Clement, Long, Ramalingam, & Halliwell, 2002; Lapidot, Walker, & Kanner 2002; Long, Clement, & Halliwell, 2000). Gallic acid is the most active compound and its anti-proliferative effect is mainly due the production of H2O2 (Lee, Hur, Lee, & Lee, 2005). On the other hand, dopamine induces both apoptosis and necrosis in different cell lines but, according to our results, these effects are only partially dependent upon the H2O2 production (Lapidot et al., 2002; Terasaka et al., 2000). In addition, other commonly occurring plant phenolic compounds (flavonoids), such as catechins, flavonols and anthocyanidins have been found to exert different biological effects through a H2O2-mediated mechanism. The extracellular generation of H2O2 has been implicated in the cytotoxicity of quercetin and myricetin (Kajiya, Ichiba, Kuwabara, Kumazawa, & Nakayama, 2001; Robaszkiewicz, Balcerczyk, & Bartosz, 2007), and in the pro-apoptotic and DNA damaging activities of (−)-epigallocatechin gallate (Elbling et al., 2005; Nakagawa, Hasumi, Woo, Nagai, & Wachi, 2004). Interestingly, it was recently found that the growth inhibitory properties of anthocyanidins, differing in the number of hydroxyl groups in the B-ring, is a consequence of their fast degradation in the culture medium producing the respective phenolic acids (Kern et al., 2007). In particular, while the degradation of delphinidin generates gallic acid, which is responsible for a substantial inhibition of proliferation, the phenolic acids (protocatechuic, vanillic and syringic), formed by the degradation of the other anthocyanidins (cyanidin, peonidin and malvidin), do not contribute to the growth inhibitory effect (Kern et al., 2007). The production of H2O2 was suggested also to be involved in the anti-proliferative effect of a complex apple phenolic extract by some authors (Lapidot et al., 2002), while it was questioned by others (Liu & Sun, 2003). Although the phenol-induced H2O2 production has been regarded as an in vitro artifact due to the interaction of the phenol with some yet unknown culture medium compound (Clement et al., 2002; Long et al., 2000), the real in vivo meaning of this property remains to be investigated. Since H2O2 is actually recognised as an important molecule for the signal transduction pathways, which regulate different cell functions, such as proliferation, growth arrest and apoptosis (Giorgio, Trinei, Migliaccio, & Pelicci, 2007), we cannot exclude the possibility that the chemopreventive properties attributed to different phenolic compounds are mediated by their capacity to alter the intracellular concentration of H2O2. In conclusion, the phenols studied can be classified as follows: (1) those which were not able to induce both apoptosis and H2O2 accumulation (tyrosol, homovanillic alcohol and protocatechuic, o-coumaric, vanillic, homovanillic, ferulic and syringic acids); (2) those which showed a pro-apoptotic activity mediated, at least in part, by the production of H2O2 as evidenced by the ability of catalase to inhibit apoptosis (3,4-DHPEA, dopamine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic, 3,4-dihydroxy-hydrocinnamic, caffeic and gallic acids); (3) those which induced apoptosis without the involvement of H2O2 (the secoiridoid derivatives of both hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol). Oleuropein showed a peculiar behaviour since, although it caused an abundant production of H2O2 in the cell culture medium, it exerted a weak pro-apoptotic effect. In addition, the metabolism of 3,4-DHPEA to homovanillic alcohol and homovanillic acid may significantly reduce its chemopreventive potential. From a structural point of view, we may conclude that the catechol moiety of the phenol molecule is necessary for the H2O2 producing activity, although further studies are necessary to investigate the structure–activity relationship of other phenols using new synthesised compounds (Pereira-Caro et al., 2009; Torres de Pinedo, Peñalver, & Morales, 2007)."
