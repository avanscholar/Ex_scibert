0,Introduction,"Renewable, clean energy has been recognized as a promising solution to address resource depletion and air pollution caused by fossil fuel consumption. Among candidates, Hydrogen (H2), which is a zero-emission fuel with a high energy conversion efficiency and the lightest weight, has been attracting increasing research interest in recent years [1]. Many advantages have been noticed for H2, such as the convenience of use, storage, and transportation could be carried out as a conventional petrochemical product, leading to being considered as a long term replacement for natural gas [2]. Currently, several strategies, promising technologies have been proposed for H2 production, such as electrolysis, thermochemical, pyrolysis, gasification, photolysis, dark fermentation, photofermentation, thermolysis, photoelectrolysis, photocatalysis, photoelectrochemical, artificial photosynthesis systems [3–22]. Some case studies have discussed the current advantages and challenges for above systems, which indicates that photocatalysis has very low negative impact on environment [22–25]. Although significant progress has been achieved over the past decades, H2 production is still required for further investigations. To date, renewable and sustainable photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (photo-HER) via sunlight-driven water splitting is much more promising and environmentally friendly than the traditional industrial methods, namely energy-intensive water electrolysis and air-polluting steam reforming [20,26–29]. In this approach, water could be split directly into H2 and oxygen (O2) using photocatalysts with sufficient potential to achieve overall water splitting. Theoretically, the photocatalytic reactions are initiated by excitation of the semiconductor photocatalyst with light energy (hν) equal to or greater than the band gap energy (Ebg) of material. Then, the photogenerated electron (e−), which leaves a photogenerated hole (h+) behind, is promoted from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) of photocatalyst [30]. Upon excitation of the semiconductor with light energy, the fate of the separated e− and h+ can follow several reaction pathways (as illustrated in Fig. 1) [31]. In typical, the water could split to produce H2 and O2 via several steps. Firstly, the water is oxidized by photogenerated h+ toward protons (H+) O2 (E VB > E°(O2/H2O)). Then, the protons are further reduced by photogenerated e− toward H2 molecules (E CB < E0(H2/H+)). It notes that the recombination could quickly occur since the pairs of photogenerated e− and h+ could undergo surface or volume to recombine with each other. It notes that most of the studies have used pure water for carrying out the photo-HER [20,32–35]. Since pure water might become a scarce resource shortly, it is crucial to find a viable alternative for pure water. There is limited research that has carried out the photo-HER from seawater, which is considered the most potential for replacing the pure water. Seawater and sunlight are abundant natural resources, and their use in water splitting is economically favorable. However, seawater contains a high quantity of various ionic (Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, K+, Cl−, and SO4 2−) and impurities components (trace amounts of iron, lead, gold, and protactinium), as shown in Table 1) [36,37]. Hence it might critically affect their photocatalytic activity and stability [38]. Li et al. reported that the reaction conditions significantly affect seawater splitting [39]. Many efforts have also been devoted to enhancing H2 production via sunlight-driven seawater splitting; however, the present efficiency and stability are still low. Besides, because seawater is highly corrosive, few photocatalysts are sufficiently durable for use in photo-HER in seawater. From our view of point, there are some concepts could be considered to promote the sunlight-driven seawater splitting, as follows: (1) inhibiting the rapid recombination of photogenerated pairs; (2) suppressing the fast-backward reaction strenuously, (3) harvesting sunlight by extended visible light absorption range effectively, and (4) minimizing the photo-corrosion. Therefore, it is preferable to develop new photocatalysts for sunlight-driven hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) of seawater [32,40,41]. We have learned that a mixed-valence titanium (Ti3+ and Ti4+) phosphate, which was first synthesized in 1999 [42], was recently found to show a significant photocatalytic property in the sunlight-driven photo-HER [43]. This incorporation of visible-light-absorbing reduced titanium (Ti3+) could effectively absorb the sunlight, leading to enhanced photo-efficiency. Offering the intrinsic features and well-characterized Ti3+/Ti4+ ratios, mixed-valence titanium compounds by direct synthesis may open up new opportunities for developing advanced photocatalytic materials photo-HER. Herein, we expanded the range of available Ti-based oxides by developing a new mixed-valence titanium phosphite (TiHPO3) photocatalyst, namely Mg(H2O)6Ti2 IIITi4 IV(HPO3)12 (denoted by MgTiP), by the hydrothermal method. Then, the sunlight-driven H2 generation from photocatalytic seawater splitting was examined with MgTiP. Two natural seawater samples were taken from the Tamsui River estuary in Tamsui District, New Taipei City, Taiwan, and the Sanxiantai waterfront in Chenggong Township, Taitung County, Taiwan. We found that the visible-light absorbing MgTiP is a durable photocatalyst and is especially suitable and stable for H2 generation from seawater. This study has opened a new facile method to prepare MgTiP photocatalysts for high-efficiency solar H2 evolution from seawater."
1,Experimental section,
2,Synthesis of mixed-valence titanium phosphite (MgTiP) photocatalyst,"2.1 Synthesis of mixed-valence titanium phosphite (MgTiP) photocatalyst In this study, all of the used chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification. Typically, the mixed-valence titanium phosphite (MgTiP) was prepared by the hydrothermal method (as illustrated in Fig. 2). Firstly, titanium foil (3.0 cm × 1.5 cm × 0.127 mm, 99%) was placed in a 23 mL Teflon-lined autoclave containing a mixture of titanium powder (5 mmol, 325 mesh, 99%), magnesium oxide (2.5 mmol), phosphorous acid (15.5 mmol), n-butylamine (2.21 mmol), and H2O (6.45 mL). The mixture was heated at 170 °C under autogenous pressure for 24 h, then slowly cooled to room temperature at 6 °C/h, controlled by a temperature programming controller attached to the furnace. Crystals of MgTiP were shaved from the Ti foil and used for all subsequent experiments."
3,Characterizations of materials,"2.2 Characterizations of materials Single-crystal X-ray diffraction intensity data were collected with a Bruker APEX DUO diffractometer equipped with a charge-coupled device area detector, with Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was recorded by a Bruker D2 PHASER desktop diffractometer at 300 W (30 kV, 10 mA; Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å)). X-band EPR spectra were recorded with a Bruker Elexsys E-580 spectrometer. The seawater's anion concentration was determined with an Ion chromatography (IC) system equipped with a conductivity detector and IonPac AS4A-SC (4 × 250 mm) column. Standard IC solutions of Cl−, Br−, and SO4 2− ions were prepared for constructing anion calibration lines. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was determined by a High-resolution X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer (HRXPS) ULVAC-PHI XPS system."
4,Derivation of Ti valence from structure analysis,"2.3 Derivation of Ti valence from structure analysis The structure of MgTiP-1 consists of three independent Ti sites at the octahedral TiO6 center and six P sites at the center of pseudo-tetrahedral HPO3. Two Mg crystallographic sites are located at unique positions on the three-fold axis, and each of them is coordinated to six water molecules ( Fig. 3). The Mg(1) was determined to be fully occupied, and Mg(2) had half occupancy; this gives multiplicities of 1/3 for Mg(1) and 1/6 for Mg(2). The derived Mg:Ti:HPO3 ratio indicates the formula 1:6:12. For charge compensation, the ratio of Ti3+ to Ti4+ was assigned as 1:2, giving the formula Mg(H2O)6[Ti2 IIITi4 IV(HPO3)12]."
5,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (photo-HER),"2.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (photo-HER) Herein, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (photo-HER) was also performed to evaluate the catalytic performance. Firstly, MgTiP catalyst (15 mg) and water (100 mL; deionized (DI) water / natural and artificial estuary seawater / natural and artificial seashore seawater) were placed in a Pyrex glass reactor and sonicated to increase dispersion. The pH was adjusted to 2.4 with H2SO4. After sonication, the reactor was sealed with a stainless-steel cover and purged with He gas to expel the remaining air in the reactor, as shown in Fig. 4a. The reactor was irradiated with a 300 W xenon lamp (PEC-L11, Peccell Technologies, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan) integrated with a simulated sunlight AM 1.5 G filter. The gas generated in the reactor was collected every hour and analyzed with a gas chromatographic system equipped with a pulsed discharge helium ionization detector. Two natural seawater samples were taken from the Tamsui River estuary in Tamsui District, New Taipei City and the Sanxiantai waterfront in Chenggong Township, Taitung County, which were called the estuary water and seashore water, respectively (Fig. 4b). The sampled seawater was analyzed for its Cl−, Br−, SO4 2− ion concentration by ion chromatography, and the analysis results are shown in Table 2. As expected, the ion concentration of seawater in the estuary is lower than that of seashore seawater. The reason is that the estuary water was sampled close to the river; hence, the ion concentrations of seawater would be diluted by the river water."
6,Results and discussions,
7,Characterizations of photocatalyst,"3.1 Characterizations of photocatalyst The crystal structure of MgTiP was determined from the single crystal, as shown in Fig. 5a, selected from a crystal grown in clusters on Ti foils (Fig. 5b) displaying deep-blue color indicative of mixed-valence titanium. Single-crystal structure analysis indicated that the chemical formula of MgTiP was Mg(H2O)6Ti6(HPO3)12. For detail, the 3D framework of MgTiP viewed along the c-axis, showing 12-membered ring (12 R) channels, was revealed in Fig. 5c, in which TiO6 octahedra are in violet, HPO3 tetrahedra in yellow, Mg atoms in green, O atoms in red, and H atoms in gray. It is expected that this structure plays an important role in mediating the valence of titanium and stability of MgTiP during the HER (vide infra). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy (Fig. 5d) gave a g-factor of 1.84, which corresponds to that of mixed-valence titanium phosphates [44]. The total number of [Mg(H2O)6]2+ units, which the charge on must be balanced by framework charge on [Ti6(HPO3)12], was used to determine the ratio of Ti3+ to Ti4+ in MgTiP. A Ti3+:Ti4+ ratio of 1:2 was confirmed by peak analysis of high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. 5e, high-resolution Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks were deconvoluted into peaks at 457.7 eV (Ti3+) and 459.6 eV (Ti4+) for Ti 2p3/2, and 463.7 eV (Ti3+) and 465.4 eV (Ti4+) for Ti 2p1/2. From the best fitting of the experimental peaks to individual components, the ratio of Ti3+ to Ti4+ was estimated to be 1:2, which perfectly matches the assigned formula."
8,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (photo-HER) using various types of water,"3.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (photo-HER) using various types of water The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (photo-HER) over MgTiP photocatalyst was performed using various water samples (such as DI water, NaCl aqueous, artificial, and natural seawater, etc.) under a simulated sunlight light source. Fig. 6 showed the amount of chloride ion in each sample, and the amount of H2 evolved from the samples. Among the six samples, artificial estuary water, which contained the same amount of chloride as the natural estuary water, produced the highest H2. The amount of H2 produced from the natural estuary water was about half produced from the artificial estuary. This can be attributed to impurities such as organic pollutants and microorganisms in natural seawater, which interfere with light absorption, decreasing the H2 evolution rate. It noted that the natural estuary water gave better results than both samples of seashore water because the higher chloride concentration of seashore water can lead to the formation of a layer of ions, which prevents absorption of water molecules catalyst surface [45]. Natural estuary water also has a higher H+ concentration than seashore water (pH 7.62 vs. 8.25), leading to increases in the H2 evolution rate. It notes that the long-term photo-stability and reusability of MgTiP photocatalyst using DI and natural estuary water are crucial factors for determining the performance and economical cost. Herein, three consecutive photo-HERs without replacing the photocatalyst were carried out to evaluate their stability and reusability. To simulate the actual sunlight-driven seawater splitting to produce H2, each cycle was stopped by turning off the light after 13 h light-reaction. Before the next cycle, the system was evacuated for 30 min, followed by ultra-pure Ar purging for 1 h. Fig. 7 showed that during three photo-HER cycles, the H2 production rate in DI water in the first cycle was higher than that in natural estuary water. The rates were similar in the second cycle. In the third cycle, the H2 production rate in natural estuary water continued to increase, whereas it declined in DI water. However, no sign of level-off in the H2 production rate was observed after three consecutive photo-HERs. This is because seawater is rich in chloride ions, which are effective hole scavenger [46]. It is worth noting that in the photo-HER, the byproducts formed from chloride ions are common disinfectants such as Cl2 or HClO, which are less harmful than those produced by other organic hole scavengers [41]. To reveal the change of chemical states of titanium in MgTiP during the photo-HER, XPS analyses (Ti scan) of MgTiP before and after photo-HER using various water, including DI water, FeCl2 aqueous, and natural estuary water, were closely monitored (as shown in Fig. 8). As we have discussed in previous section, the XPS of fresh MgTiP clearly showed that the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks were deconvoluted into peaks at 457.7 eV (Ti3+) and 459.6 eV (Ti4+) for Ti 2p3/2, and 463.7 eV (Ti3+) and 465.4 eV (Ti4+) for Ti 2p1/2. In this designed MgTiP catalyst, the ratio of Ti3+ to Ti4+ was estimated to be 1:2. As indicated in Fig. 8d and f, the XPS spectrum of MgTiP after photo-HER in FeCl2 shows that the original Ti3+:Ti4+ ratio, i.e., 1:2, was retained. However, the photocatalyst tended to be oxidized by photogenerated holes when the photo-HER was conducted in DI water without sacrificing reagents (Fig. 8b). Photo-corrosion caused by a lack of a hole-scavenger usually damages the photocatalyst structure, resulting in the only Ti4+ for the MgTiP catalyst. Fortunately, the MgTiP structure remained intact, which was confirmed by XRD analysis (Fig. 8g). The reason could explain that the increased positive charge arising from oxidation of Ti3+ to Ti4+ might dissipate through some degree of hydrolysis on [Mg(H2O)6]2+. Then, the proton transfer might be occurred from coordinated water molecules resulting in inbound hydroxide, namely [Mg(OH)2(H2O)4]. For this balance, the overall charge on the catalyst is unchanged without affecting the TiHPO3 framework's integrity. The unique 12-membered ring (12 R) channels structure of MgTiP with tunable hexa-hydrated magnesium ions is considered to provide the long-term photo-stability catalyst. The using FeCl2 sacrificing reagent or using directly seawater could effectively protect the catalysts by retaining the structure and crystallinity of MgTiP photocatalyst."
9,Comparison of photo-HER using seawater,"3.3 Comparison of photo-HER using seawater To date, there is limited researches have carried out the photo-HER for H2 production from seawater. It is believed that the sunlight-driven hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) of seawater would be a favorable renewable, sustainable, and economical process for H2 production since both seawater and sunlight are abundant natural resources. Although the experimental conditions for H2 production from seawater in the literature are different, it is worth comparing the photo-HER on the basis of H2 evolution rate. Table 3 summarizes the recent development of new photocatalysts for photo-HER performance using seawater. In this study, MgTiP was carried out without the presence of a sacrificial agent. Its H2 production rate could reach up to 629.3 µmol·gcat −1·h−1 under simulated sunlight. Recently, Shuang et al. successfully designed porous brookite TiO2 nanoflutes decorated with Pt nanoparticles (Pt/b-TiO2 porous nanoflutes) for direct, overall light-driven seawater splitting under the UV light or sunlight irradiation [47]. The H2 production rate could reach up to 7.2 mmol·gcat −1·h−1 after 5 h of Hg lamp irradiation (λ ≥ 300 nm, 500 W). Interestingly, Guan et al. disclosed on the first demonstration of the excellent production of H2 from simulated seawater on p-GaN-based nanowire arrays without any external bias or sacrificial agents [41]. An H2 production rate of 5.1 mol·gcat −1·h−1 was obtained over p-GaN/InGaN nanowire arrays, among the best-reported performances."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, an unprecedented mixed-valence titanium phosphite (MgTiP) is successfully constructed by controlling the oxidation of Ti metal via adopting Ti foil as an electrode-like substrate. Its intrinsic photocatalytic properties were preliminarily investigated in the presence of a hole scavenger (2 mM FeCl2 solution). The using FeCl2 sacrificing reagent or using directly seawater could effectively protect the catalysts by retaining the structure and crystallinity of MgTiP photocatalyst. Its H2 production rate could reach up to 629.3 µmol·gcat −1·h−1 under simulated sunlight. The long-term stability of MgTiP was confirmed by constant H2 production during day-and-night cycling photo-HER measurements. The novel phosphite-based structure of MgTiP increases the diversity of Ti-based oxides that are available as photocatalysts. This work provides a facile hydrothermal method to prepare mixed-valence titanium compounds and demonstrates the promising application to use natural and abundant sources of sunlight for photocatalytic seawater splitting."
