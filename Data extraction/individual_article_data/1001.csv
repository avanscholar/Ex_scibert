0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is considered to be an environmentally clean energy carrier and a promising fuel of the future, and while it is the most abundant element in the Universe it does not exist in its molecular form in nature. However, hydrogen is a constituent of almost all gaseous, liquid and solid state organic compounds. The various types of renewable and non-renewable sources potentially available for hydrogen production include fossil fuels, alcohols, water and biomass. However, hydrogen recovery from these resources does require the application of energy to the production process. Due to its physical and chemical properties, hydrogen storage and handling is technically problematic, which is why hydrogen is still not widely used as a fuel. Distributed hydrogen production (production at the point of use) [1–5], on-board hydrogen production [6–10] and hydrogen-enriched gas production (gas mixture of hydrogen with other components) [10–12] all appear to share the potential to avoid these drawbacks. The past few years have seen increased interest in hydrogen-enriched hydrocarbon combustion, both gaseous and liquid. It has been shown that hydrogen-enriched gas supplementation of internal combustion processes could potentially reduce NOx and CO emissions and reduce fuel consumption, combined with stable combustion flame fronts allowing operation under lean conditions [10,13–19]. Different kinds of technologies have been proposed for on-board hydrogen production, such as a low current plasmatron fuel converters [19], gliding arc plasma reactors [20], and scaled-down autothermal membrane reformers [9], to name but a few. The plasma processing of gases and liquids by microwave discharge is of high interest due to its numerous advantages, one of which being that the plasma is a source of ionised and excited states of atoms, molecules and radicals, with highly reactive properties [21,22]. Due to the high density of the microwave plasma, which involves highly reactive species that enhance the chemical reaction rates, the catalyst-free processing of hydrocarbons becomes possible [22], and thus avoiding the problems related to catalyst deactivation (chemical, mechanical, and thermal) and regeneration [23]. Microwave plasma (915 MHz, 2.45 GHz) achieves a higher density of reactive radicals in comparison with RF plasma (2–60 MHz), and also ensures faster response times. A well designed microwave plasma system with suitably selected operational parameters can achieve almost 100% microwave power coupling efficiency, from microwave generator to the plasma. Another advantage is the possibility of electrodeless operation, resulting in high purity plasma. This is why this paper describes a method of hydrogen-enriched gas production, based on kerosene combined with an atmospheric pressure microwave plasma system. Atmospheric pressure operation, in contrast to systems using a vacuum plasma, simplifies the method and reduces the operational costs. Kerosene is a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons and is widely used in industry (e.g. as jet engine fuel) and in households (e.g. as lighter fuel and heating oil). The plasma reforming of kerosene has been studied both theoretically and experimentally [11,24,25]. We have published the experimental results of microwave plasma kerosene reforming related to hydrogen production in earlier papers [26,27]. In [26] the optical emission spectroscopy study of CO2 plasma with the addition of kerosene vapour was presented, while in [27] the hydrogen production rate and the energy yield of hydrogen production as the hydrogen production efficiency parameters were evaluated. This paper focuses on the concentrations of gaseous compounds resulting from kerosene processing in a CO2 plasma as a function of the energy delivered to the microwave plasma, kerosene flow rate and CO2 flow rate. The results are presented of both the experimental and the theoretical studies. Section 2 of this paper presents the microwave plasma system for hydrogen-enriched gas production from kerosene including a waveguide-based microwave plasma source (MPS). Section 3 presents the experimental results, while Section 4 (Numerical modelling the Thermodynamic Equilibrium Reactor (TER)) describes the model, the results of the gas composition simulations and the sensitivities of all calculated species to the reactions used in the model. Finally, Section 5 contains a summary and the conclusions."
1,Experimental method,"The experimental method of hydrogen-enriched gas production is based on the decomposition of kerosene vapour in a carbon dioxide microwave plasma, at atmospheric pressure. A schematic representation of the system is shown in Fig. 1 , which consists of a 915 MHz microwave generator equipped with a circulator and water load, bi-directional coupler with dual channel power meter, three-stub tuner, microwave plasma source (MPS), adjustable plunger, kerosene tank, vaporizer supply and control unit, induction vaporizer, CO2 compressed gas tank, gas flow control of the thermal mass flow type, gas-soot separator and SRI 8010C and Shimadzu 2014 gas chromatographs for inlet and outlet gas composition analyses. All the system waveguide components are based on a WR975 rectangular waveguide, of internal dimensions 247.65 × 123.825 mm. In the waveguide-based MPS (Fig. 2 ), the microwave power was delivered to the field-shaping structure in the form of a reduced height section preceded and followed by tapered sections. The reduced height section ensured higher electric field intensity in the plasma forming region, while the tapered sections gave a smooth transition from the standard WR 975 waveguide dimensions to the reduced height waveguide. The dielectric (quartz) tube, of inner diameter 26 mm, outer diameter 30 mm and length 1000 mm, was positioned centrally in the reduced height section and vertically in relation to the waveguide wide walls. Outside the waveguide the quartz tube was surrounded by an outer metal cylinder. The carbon dioxide (Air Liquide Polska), of a purity greater than or equal to 99.8 (% vol.), in the quartz tube was supplied by four inlets, ensuring the formation of a swirl gas flow through the tube. Such a method of introducing gas into the quartz tube stabilizes the plasma and protected the tube wall against overheating. Kerosene (lamp oil) of a chemical composition given by the supplier (Dorex, Poland, Table 1 ) was injected axially into the quartz tube. To initiate plasma generation inside the quartz tube, an igniter in the form of a movable metal pin was used. After plasma ignition, the igniter was withdrawn from the plasma region. The experimental study was performed with a CO2 flow rate of 2700 NL/h, and a kerosene flow rate between 0.4 kg/h and 1.2 kg/h. The kerosene vapour temperature before entering the microwave plasma was set at 400 °C, with the absorbed microwave power being varied between 4 kW and 6 W. In our experimental investigations the total outlet gas flow rate was determined from the mass balance of conversion products. As it was earlier checked results obtained in such a way are in a good correlation with the total gas flow rate of the outlet gas measured using the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique. The application of PIV technique for the total outlet gas flow rate determination was reported by us in [28]. To determine the volume concentration of the gaseous plasma components in the outlet gas each outlet gas sample was analyzed three times. The error in determining the volume concentration of the gaseous plasma components in the outlet gas did not exceed 5%. To confirm reproducibility of the achieved experimental results selected experimental measurements were performed few times for statistics. Results obtained that way confirm good repeatability of the experimental results. The study was performed without the aid of any catalyst."
2,Experimental results,"Composition of kerosene used in our experiments is presented in Table 1. We assumed that kerosene may be represented solely by n-dodecane, thus all chromatographic measurements and further calculations as well as numerical modelling used n-dodecane as kerosene. Initial composition of gas before plasma processing was: CO2 95.5% and kerosene (represented by n-dodecane) 4.5%. The relationship between the volume concentrations of the gaseous plasma components in the outlet gas and the absorbed microwave power is shown in Figs. 3 and 4 . For the results in Fig. 3 the measurements were carried out at a CO2 flow rate of 2700 NL/h, kerosene flow rate of 0.4 kg/h and absorbed microwave power between 4 and 5 kW. In the case of Fig. 4 the measurements were carried out at a CO2 flow rate of 2700 NL/h, kerosene flow rate of 0.8 kg/h and absorbed microwave power between 4 and 6 kW. The following gaseous by-products were registered in the outlet gas volume: hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), acetylene (C2H2), and ethylene (C2H4). It was observed that the products CO2, CO and H2 had the highest volume concentrations, while those of CH4, C2H2, and C2H4 were not higher than 2%. The high volume concentration of CO2 was a result of applying CO2 as an MPS input gas, resulting in unprocessed CO2 appearing in the output gas composition. Fig. 3 shows that at smaller kerosene flow rates (0.4 kg/h), no significant changes in the volume concentration of the gaseous plasma components in the outlet gas were registered at any absorbed microwave power level. This could be considered to be against expectations but, as shown earlier [26], the hydrogen production rate (in NL(H2)/h) did not vary with the absorbed microwave power. The same effect was observed in the case of ethanol and isopropanol plasma reforming at a CO2 flow rate of 2700 NL/h with the amount of liquid compounds containing hydrogen vapour at 0.4 kg/h [27]. In the case of higher kerosene flow rates (0.8 kg/h) the effect of the absorbed microwave power on the volume concentration of the gaseous plasma components became significant. The results in Fig. 4 show that a high absorbed microwave power level was beneficial for hydrogen production, with the H2 volume concentration in the outlet gas growing as the absorbed microwave power was increased. An increase in the absorbed microwave power from 4 to 6 kW, at fixed CO2 and kerosene flow rates, resulted in an increase in H2 concentration of about 40%. Across the absorbed microwave power range (4–6 kW) no saturation of H2 concentration, or that of any other gas component, was observed. This implied that H2 concentration could be improved at higher microwave power values. As with H2, the CO volume concentration also increased with each increase in the absorbed microwave power. The conversion degree of the CO2 also increased with each increase in the absorbed microwave power. The volume concentrations of the CH4, C2H2 and C2H4 decreased with each increase in the absorbed microwave power. This effect of the absorbed microwave power on the volume concentrations of the gaseous plasma components in the outlet gas was also observed in [29]. It is worth mentioning that in [29] the 2.45 GHz microwave discharge was directly generated in a methanol and ethanol solution. The growth of the H2 output concentration with increasing discharge current was also observed in the case of plasma reforming of ethanol using a DC electric discharge in a flowing gas channel with a liquid wall [30]. Figs. 5 and 6 illustrate the effect of the kerosene flow rate on the volume concentration of the gaseous plasma components in the outlet gas. The results corresponded to a CO2 flow rate of 2700 NL/h. Two series of measurements are presented. The first shows an absorbed microwave power level of 4 kW with a kerosene flow rate of 0.4–0.8 kg/h and the second for an absorbed microwave power of 5 kW and a kerosene flow rate of 0.4–1.2 kg/h. As can be seen from Figs. 5 and 6, for a kerosene flow rate range of 0.4–0.8 kg/h the increase in the volume concentration of H2 could be observed with each increase in kerosene flow rate. It implied that increasing the amount of the gaseous compound containing hydrogen introduced to the plasma resulted in higher values of volume concentration of H2 in the outlet gas. At the same time the volume concentrations of CO, CH4, C2H2, and C2H4 increased with each increase in kerosene flow rate while the CO2 volume concentration decreased with each increase in the kerosene flow rate. However, some deviations were observed from this kerosene flow rate effect on the volume concentrations of the gaseous plasma components in the outlet gas at higher kerosene flow rates (see Fig. 6). At a kerosene flow rate of 1.2 kg/h, the lower and the higher values of the volume concentrations of CO and CO2 respectively, was observed in comparison with the values for a kerosene flow rate of 0.8 kg/h. Also, the increase in the H2 volume concentration did not appear to be linear. Moreover, as shown in [27], the hydrogen production rate and the energy yield of hydrogen production increased with each increase in the amount of kerosene vapour introduced to the plasma, although at a sufficiently high kerosene flow rate both parameters become saturated. It should be mentioned that the plasma reforming of kerosene was characterized by a relatively high soot production when the kerosene mass flow rate increases to 0.8 kg/h. The formation of solid carbon was also recorded in [31], dealing with ethanol decomposition in an argon microwave plasma generated using a TIAGO type of MPS. Similarly, as in the experiment described in this paper, solid carbon as a by-product was noticed at higher flow rates of the liquid compounds containing hydrogen (ethanol) introduced to the plasma. We have calculated mass balance of carbon in the process and we have found that soot production is in the range 1.7–2.5 g/min for microwave power 4–6 kW, kerosene flow rate 0.8 kg/h and carbon dioxide flow rate 2700 NL/h. Soot deposit causes the malfunction of the MPS. The most problematic was the soot deposits on the quartz tube inner wall around the plasma generation region. In such a case soot accumulation over time caused the change in the dielectric properties of the quartz tube and thus problem with microwaves penetration to the plasma. Also creating the local hot spots resulted from high microwave absorption by soot may be a cause of tube melting and in consequence it could damage the quartz tube. All of it could disturb the plasma stability and thus the effectiveness of the H2 production. Thus, the above mentioned issue limits the operation of the MPS to the kerosene flow rates lower than 0.8 kg/h. To avoid the mentioned above problem with intensive generation of soot in the plasma generation region we re-designed and built a modified MPS [32]. In contrast to the present MPS, in this case kerosene vapour can be supplied directly into the plasma flame behind the plasma generation region. The results of the experimental tests on hydrogen production by conversion of ethanol in the thermal reforming process in nitrogen plasma in that case are promising and will be given in details in another publication. Based on the results of our previous experimental work on ethanol [33] and isopropanol [34] plasma reforming, it was expected that H2 volume concentration would decrease with each increase in CO2 flow rate. An increased amount of CO2 introduced into the plasma reforming kerosene process resulted in the dilution of H2 in the volume of the gaseous plasma components in the outlet gas as well as an increase in the process energy consumption. As shown in [33,34], increasing the CO2 flow rate resulted in decreasing the hydrogen production rate as well as the energy yield of the hydrogen (in NL(H2)/kWh). An additional confirmation of this effect of the CO2 flow rate on the H2 volume concentration in the outlet gas can be found in [35]. In the case of ethanol decomposition using an atmospheric pressure microwave argon (Ar) plasma, the concentration of the main gaseous products decreased when the Ar flow rate was increased, and a decrease in both gas temperature and electron density was recorded with each increase in Ar. It should be mentioned that in our experimental system the low CO2 flow rate, especially from the long-term hydrogen production point of view, is inadvisable. A sufficiently high CO2 flow rate is required to assure plasma stability and, when operating with microwaves of the order of several kW, to protect the quartz tube against destruction due to overheating. The importance of the effect that the gas supply has on the duration of the ethanol plasma reforming system was also reported in [30]. The amount of hydrogen produced from each litre of kerosene as a function of absorbed microwave power and kerosene flow rate is shown in Fig. 7 . It shows the linear increase in the amount of hydrogen produced from each litre of kerosene with each increase in the absorbed microwave power. However, the dependence of the amount of hydrogen produced from each litre of kerosene on the kerosene flow rate is not linear. Consequently, the above described effect of the kerosene flow rate on the volume concentration of the gaseous plasma components at higher values of kerosene flow rate is reflected in the amount of hydrogen produced from each litre of kerosene as a function of the kerosene flow rate. The best result in terms of the quantity of the hydrogen produced from each litre of kerosene, i.e. 470 NL(H2), was obtained for a CO2 flow rate of 2700 NL/h and absorbed microwave power of 6 kW. Table 2 lists the concentrations of the gaseous plasma components in the outlet gas as well as the hydrogen production rate and the energy yield of the hydrogen as hydrogen production efficiency parameters. We did not detect any n-dodecane in the outlet gas nor in the soot samples. Thus, we assume that the kerosene conversion is complete. Modelling results confirm that we should not detect any n-dodecane after the plasma processing. Water is one of the products of kerosene conversion. It is present in the soot separator. From the mass balance we calculated that 122 g of hydrogen (introduced in 800 g/h of n-dodecane) was converted into about 20 g of light hydrocarbons (CH4, C2H2 and C2H4). The rest, i.e. about 60 g of hydrogen, was transformed into other products like water and heavy hydrocarbons adsorbed on soot particles (we detected them but without identification)."
3,Numerical modelling,"Numerical modelling was carried out for the purpose of optimizing the hydrogen production from kerosene. This was done with a commercial software package: Chemical Work Bench, version 3.1, by Kintech Ltd., Moscow, Russia [36]. Plasma formation was simulated with a Thermodynamic Equilibrium Reactor (TER), in which all CO2 and kerosene vapours were mixed, followed by a Calorimetric Bomb Reactor (CBR) to simulate the gas composition changes caused by the chemical reactions. The simulation was based on a given input energy in the range 1000–50,000 kJ kg−1 and a constant pressure of 0.1 MPa. For the purpose of this work 366 chemical reactions involving 72 species concerning the processing of kerosene were taken in a precise form from [37]. Boundary conditions, i.e. mass flows, initial temperature, initial pressure, initial composition and input energy, were the same as in the experiment. It was assumed that the reaction time was 1 s. The model predicted the complete decomposition of kerosene at low input energy rates of up to 1300 kJ/kg (Fig. 8 ). This value corresponds to an absorbed power of 2.3 kW which, unfortunately, could not be tested experimentally since it was insufficient to sustain the microwave plasma in our system. From Fig. 8 it can also be seen that the highest concentration of hydrogen, with no by-products except CO, could be achieved at an input energy approximately 4400 kJ/kg (7.8 kW). However, our microwave power generator was unable to generate this level of power. Due to the power limitation, as well as the maximum kerosene vapour flow of 0.8 kg/h achievable in the tested system, the only possible parameter for system optimization was the CO2 flow rate. In the experiment this parameter was set at 2700 NL/h, but it could be increased significantly. Fig. 9 shows the concentrations of species monitored in the experiment as a function of the CO2 flow rate. The experimental concentrations related to a microwave power of 6 kW. The calculated and experimental values were generally consistent, especially in the case of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Although the hydrogen concentration was the highest at the experimentally applied CO2 flow rate, a further increase in the CO2 flow rate could result in a gas that is less contaminated with hydrocarbons. The analysis of reaction rates led to the determination of the sensitivities of all the calculated species to the reactions used in the model. The calculation of the sensitivity coefficient matrix demonstrated the most and the least significant chemical reactions in the reactions list. The results of the sensitivity calculation are presented in Figs. 10–14 , which show the reactions responsible for the results seen in Fig. 9. Hydrogen (Fig. 10) is produced mainly in four reactions from ethylene, water, propene and the allyl radical, C3H5. At the same time most is consumed in the reactions in the formation of ethane. The concentrations of ethane in both the model and the experiment were below any detection limits due to the dissociation of the ethane precursor, i.e. the C2H5 radical, which is the main source of ethylene (Fig. 11). This hydrocarbon is formed at much lower rates in two other reactions involving propene and the CH2 and CH3 radicals. At the same time it is also decomposed into the C2H3 radical and acetylene. The latter is formed mainly from C2H3 radicals (Fig. 12) and is oxidized by the hydroxyl radicals. Acetylene oxidation is an important reaction for two other by-products: methane and carbon monoxide. Methane (Fig. 13) is formed from CH3 radicals, and this radical is also a product of methane dissociation. Two other sources of methane are ethane and ethylene. Carbon monoxide (Fig. 14) is produced primarily from the CH2CO radical, as a product of acetylene oxidation. The same radical is also a main path for CO loss, together with the regeneration of CO2."
4,Conclusion,"This paper presented a method of hydrogen-enriched gas production by the decomposition of kerosene vapour in a carbon dioxide microwave (915 MHz) plasma, operated at atmospheric pressure. The experimental and numerical investigations focused primarily on the analysis of the hydrogen-enriched gas composition. Selected experimental results were compared with the results of the numerical modelling. The numerical modelling was also conducted in order to understand the gas composition changes caused by the chemical reactions and to aid in optimizing hydrogen production from kerosene in the future. The analysis of the experimental and numerical results allowed us to make the following conclusions: – the microwave plasma system is capable of producing hydrogen-enriched gas by kerosene reformation, – hydrogen-enriched gas production using microwave plasma system can be operated without the use of any catalyst, – the best result in terms of the quantity of hydrogen produced from 1 L of kerosene was 470 NL(H2), which correspond to a CO2 flow rate of 2700 NL/h and absorbed microwave power of 6 kW, – the best achieved result of hydrogen content in the produced hydrogen-enriched gas was about 12%, obtained at a kerosene flow rate of 0.8 kg/h, CO2 flow rate of 2700 NL/h and absorbed microwave power of 6 kW. The hydrocarbon content, acceptable price, feasible transportation and storage makes the kerosene a prospective fuel for hydrogen gas production. Thus, the most promising application of the described microwave plasma system is on-board hydrogen-enriched gas production to supply aircraft fuel cells for power generation. Fig. 15 shows a block diagram of that idea, with the hydrogen gas being produced from a kerosene-type jet fuel (Jet A and Jet A-1) already typically carried by aircraft. There is also the fact that kerosene-type jet fuel is and, as forecast, will be used as an aviation turbine fuel for the future decades [38]."
