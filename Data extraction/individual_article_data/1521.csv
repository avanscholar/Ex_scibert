0,Introduction,"Synthetic strategies to obtain carbonyl compounds have always been one of the most fertile arenas in the field of academic research and industrial application, for the aldehydes/ketone products are important intermediates in fine chemical and pharmaceutical industry [1–3]. The selective oxidation of alcohols with aqueous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is generally regarded as a great potential route in the view of green chemistry [4,5]. To date, great efforts have been made to the development of efficient catalytic systems for this transformation. Among these, heteropoly acids (HPAs) have been studied extensively owning to their versatile acid/redox properties, excellent stability, high reactivity and selectivity, and high H2O2 utilization efficiency [6–8]. Phosphotungstic acid (HPW), as a classical commercial Keggin-type HPA, usually worked as high efficient catalyst via formation of the active oxygen-transfer species Venturello–Ishii {PO4 [WO(O2)2]4}3- activated by H2O2 during oxidation process [9]. However, most of these processes are still confined to academic research because of the common challenge of homogeneous system like the deactivation, separation and reusability of catalyst and the purification of product [10]. As a result, the development of advanced HPA-based heterogeneous catalysts for this conversion is highly desirable. Up to now, a growing number of researchers have focused on the heterogenization of HPAs, yielding two main strategies, solidification and immobilization. As ILs have recently been noticed for their excellent physicochemical properties and applications in various fields [11–15], a series of IL-based organic cations, such as the quaternary ammonium and imidazolium cations, were employed for solidification with various heteropolyanions to fabricate insoluble hybrid catalysts [16–18]. M. Keshavarz and coworkers reported two novel piperaziniumpolyoxometalate-based acidic ionic liquids presented efficient activity in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol with 35% H2O2 [19]. J. Wang et al. developed a self-assembled mesoporous polyoxometalate-based ionic hybrid catalyst [TMGHA]2.4H0·6PW that gave a high conversion of 97.9% and selectivity of 93.5% in the water-mediated triphasic benzyl alcohol selective oxidation reaction [18]. For the immobilization method, HPAs were chemically immobilized on the solid supporters, such as modified silica [20], metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) [21], metal oxides [22], carbon materials [15] and poly (ionic liquid)s [23]. For example, G. Xue and coworkers immobilized the divanadium-substituted phosphotungstate onto magnetic mesoporous silica to give magnetic catalyst Fe3O4@mSiO2/NH-PV2W that was successfully employed as an efficient catalyst in the synthesis of carbonyl compounds from alcohols [24]. Hence, the issues related to improved surface area, separation and reusability have been addressed to a great extent. Notably, multiple phases including aqueous/organic biphase and solid catalyst phase are involved in the above catalytic systems. Therefore, despite these rapid advances, it remains a long-term goal for the exploration of approaches to the inherent problems of mass transfer, diffusion, the exposure and accessibility of active sites. Seeking appropriate supporters with amphipathicity and high surface area becomes one of the key technology solutions to overcome these drawbacks. Graphene oxide has emerged as one of the most potential supporters because it inherited the unique one-atom-thick layered structure and high specific surface area of its precursor, graphene [25–29]. Moreover, various oxygen-containing functional groups, including carboxylic acid, ketones, epoxy, and hydroxyl groups, are distributed on the basal planes and edges of GO [30,31]. These groups endow GO with favorable hydrophilicity and provide great potential of task-specific modification. Accordingly, the combination of immobilization and solidification strategies led to a unique heterogeneous catalyst consisting of IL cations, GO, and heteropolyanions that confidently satisfy the requirements of efficient conversion of alcohols with H2O2 to useful carbonyl compounds. Based on the above considerations, herein, we have synthesized a class of ionic liquid, PW anions, and GO integrated heterogeneous catalysts through a facile amino protonation and/or anion-exchange reaction between PW and IL-functionalized GO (Scheme 1 ). These materials could offer the advantage of homogeneous catalysts (higher activity) and heterogeneous catalysts (ease of separation/reusing), and then were employed in the selective oxidation of alcohols with H2O2. The obtained hybrids were characterized by solid-state 31P NMR, elemental analysis (EA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurement, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray powder diffraction (PXRD). The results showed that PW anions were successfully intercalated into the IL-functionalized GO sheets of large surface area, offering PW@IL-GO catalysts that had the properties of amphipathicity, stability and accessibility of active sites. As expected, PW@IL-GO exhibited good catalytic performance and excellent reusability in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde with H2O2 under solvent-free condition."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Graphite powder (99.999% purity, 200 mesh) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Phosphotungstic acid (99.0%, H3PW12O40, HPW), benzyl alcohol (99.5%), α-phenethyl alcohol (99.0%), diphenylmethanol (99.0%), cyclohexanol (99.0%), pentan-2-ol (99.0%), n-pentanol (99.5%), N-methylimidazole (99.0%) and 3-bromopropylamine hydrobromide (98.0%) were obtained from J&K Scientific Ltd. Deionized water (resistivity: 18.25 MΩ cm) was commonly used in our laboratory. Unless otherwise specified, the other chemicals and solvents in analytic grade (Damao Chemical Reagent) were supplied by local suppliers and used as received. GO was synthesized via a modified Hummers’ method [32], and amine-functionalized imidazole ionic liquid (IL-NH2) was synthesized according to the procedures reported in the literature [33] (see section 2 in the Supporting Information)."
3,Synthesis of catalysts,"2.2 Synthesis of catalysts Preparation of IL-GO: Typically, the obtained GO (1.0 g) was dispersed in deionized water by ultrasonication for 30 min at room temperature to form a suspension with the concentration of 1.0 mg/mL. Then, IL-NH2 (2.0 g) was added to the above suspension and the salt effect of the GO sheets occurred immediately. The reaction system mixed uniformly under vigorously magnetic stirring, followed by slowly adding a solution of KOH (2.0 g) in 50 mL deionized water and ultrasonication for 30 min. Subsequently, the reactor was transferred to an oil bath and stirred at 80 °C for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the solid was separated by centrifugation and washed with methanol and deionized water until neutral. Finally, the IL-GO was obtained by drying in vacuum at 80 °C for 24 h. FT-IR (KBr): ṽ max = 3350, 2920, 2855, 1590, 1470, 1440, 1410, 1224, 1164, and 624 cm−1. Preparation of PW@IL-GO: Typically, the obtained IL-GO (1.5 g) was dispersed in 100 mL de-ionized water. Then, HPW solution by dissolving 0.5 mmol of HPW in 5 mL deionized water, was slowly dropped into the above IL-GO suspension and stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The solid was separated by filtration and washed with methanol and deionized water until neutral. Finally, the black PW@IL-GO(0.5) powder was obtained by drying in vacuum at 50 °C for 24 h. FT-IR (KBr): ṽ max = 3440, 2920, 2850, 1580, 1520, 1460, 1224, 1164, 1080, 1049, 988, 894, 806 and 624 cm−1. PW@IL-GO(1.0), PW@IL-GO(1.5) and PW@IL-GO(2.0) were prepared by identical condition except that the amount of HPW is 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mmol, respectively."
4,Catalyst testing,"2.3 Catalyst testing The typical procedures for the selective oxidation of alcohols with H2O2: the prepared PW-IL-GO(m) (0.15 mol%), benzyl alcohol (5 mmol) and deionized water (5 mL) were added into a 25 mL two-neck flask. The reaction mixture was heated to 100 °C for 5 min under magnetic stirring. Then, a solution of H2O2 (4 mL, 15 wt%) was added dropwise into the above mixture within 0.5 h and the reaction system was stirred at 100 °C for another 4.5 h. After reaction, the catalyst was recovered by centrifugation. The liquid phase was extracted by dichloromethane and then quantitatively analyzed by GC analysis (6890 N) equipped with a flame ionization detection and a capillary column (HP19091G-B213, 30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 mm) to determine the conversion (conversion = {[(total moles of alcohol) – (moles of residual alcohol)]/[total moles of alcohol]} × 100%) and selectivity (selectivity = {[moles of targeted product]/[total moles of products]} × 100%). The purity and structure of products were also confirmed by 1H NMR and 13C NMR analysis. The recovered catalyst was washed with ethanol and deionized water, dried at 50 °C overnight under vacuum, and then used for the next run. Three parallel experiments were carried out, and the conversion and selectivity were taken as the average."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalysts synthesis,"3.1 Catalysts synthesis As illustrated in Scheme 1, the IL-functionalized GO (IL-GO) was first synthesized through ring-opening reaction between the amino groups of 1-(3-aminopropyl)-3-methylimidazolium bromide (IL-NH2) and pre-existing epoxy groups on GO basal plane. PW@IL-GO(m) (m = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0; m is the initial addition amount of PW) were synthesized by the anion-exchange reaction and then secondary amino protonation reaction of IL-GO with HPW [34]. These as-prepared hybrid catalysts offer several distinct benefits:(1) The high surface area improve the dispersion and exposure of active sites, thereby making the accessibility for substrates more favorable. (2) Oxygen-containing and IL groups give the amphipathicity of catalyst that provide good water/organic bypasses compatibility. (3) Intercalated ILs, as the buffer layer, avoid the dense stacking of GO sheets, making for improving the mass-transfer efficiency. (4) Importantly, the cationic moiety in the skeleton endows a strong cation–anion interaction for the stable immobilization of heteropolyanions anions. Table S1 shows the ICP-OES and N elemental analysis results of the obtained catalysts, and the loading amounts of IL in IL-GO was found to be 1.73 mmol/g. ICP-OES results revealed that the PW loading amount in the PW@IL-GO(0.5), PW@IL-GO(1.0), PW@IL-GO(1.5) and PW@IL-GO(2.0) is 0.16, 0.21, 0.23 and 0.23 mmol/g, respectively. According to the pervious report [34], the anion-exchange reaction is prior to the protonation reaction of secondary amine group during the treatment of IL-GO with HPW. Thus, the components of above catalysts were confirmed, and their structures were described in Chart S1. As is depicted, both PW@IL-GO(0.5) and PW@IL-GO(1.0) were obtained by partly exchanging with PW anions, while both PW@IL-GO(1.5) and PW@IL-GO(2.0) were the totally anion-exchanged and partly secondary amino-protonated samples."
7,Catalysts characterization,"3.2 Catalysts characterization PW@IL-GO(m) (m = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0) catalysts are stable in an air condition, and their structures and compositions were further confirmed by FT-IR, XRD, SEM, TEM, 31P NMR, TGA, and XPS analysis. Fig. 1 depicts the FT-IR spectra of GO, IL-GO, PW@IL-GO(1.5), and HPW. For GO (Fig. 1, curve a), the typical bands at 1732, 1224 and 1050 cm−1 are assigned to CO (COOH) vibration, OH deformation, and C–O (epoxy) stretching, respectively. The band at 1618 cm−1 is for the C–C vibration of the graphitic domains [35]. The broad peak at 3350 cm−1 could be identified as arising from the vibration of hydroxyl groups and/or adsorbed water molecules [36]. Compared with GO, IL-GO shows a strong peak at 1590 cm−1 for the bending vibration of N–H bond generated from the ring-open reaction of –NH2 with epoxy group [35]. Meanwhile, the peak intensity for the hydroxy group (1224 cm−1) increases slightly, and the peak for epoxy group (1050 cm−1) has disappeared in IL-GO (Fig. 1, curve b). Moreover, the two new peaks for the imidazole ring in IL-GO are observed at 1164 and 624 cm−1, which directly indicates that the imidazolium-IL moiety is introduced into the GO sheet [37]. Further, HPW gives four characteristic peaks at 1080, 988, 894, and 806 cm−1 featured for the Keggin structure of HPW, which are attributed to P−Oa (central oxygen), WO (terminal oxygen), W−Ob−W (corner-sharing oxygen), and W−Oc−W (edge-sharing oxygen), respectively (Fig. 1, curve d) [38]. The above characteristic bands PW@IL-GO(1.5) are clearly detected, demonstrating that the structure of the PW anion is well reserved after immobilization (Fig. 1, curves c vs. d). Obviously, the P−Oa peak at 1080 cm−1 is split into two peaks at 1080 and 1049 cm−1, possibly due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the terminal oxygens of PW anion and secondary amino group in IL-GO [34,39,40]. Fig. 2 shows the PXRD patterns of the HPW, PW@IL-GO(m) (m = 1.5, 1.0 and 0.5), IL-GO and GO. HPW displays a series of diffraction peaks of the Keggin crystalline structure (Fig. 2, curve a). However, these sharp peaks disappear in PW@IL-GO(m) (m = 1.5, 1.0 and 0.5) (Fig. 2, curves b, c and d). It suggests the formation of an amorphous phase, possibly due to the highly dispersed nature of PW anions on the surface of GO sheets after the immobilization. On the other hand, the broad peaks appeared in low-angle (2θ = 7.9°) which imply the formation of a new structure assembled by IL cations and PW anions and the existence of cavities between cations and anions of this self-assembled macrostructure [17]. These cavities generate increasing mass-transfer efficiency in the catalytic reactions [41]. Besides, the strong diffraction peak at 2θ = 10.6° for GO (Fig. 2, curve f) is disappeared for PW@IL-GO(m) (m = 1.5, 1.0 and 0.5), indicating disordered stacking of the PW@IL-GO layers [42]. The higher-angle broad peak (25.8°) could be attributed to the stack of reduced GO [36] sheets that generated from the remove of some oxygen-containing groups during the synthesis of IL-GO. The 31P NMR spectrum (Fig. S1) of the PW@IL-GO(1.5) reflects a distinct single signal at δ = 13.5 ppm, against the known only signal (δ = 15.5 ppm) for pure HPW [43,44]. It could be attributed to the strong interaction between IL cations and PW anions, resulting in the distortion of the symmetry of the PO4 structure [45]. A similar phenomenon has been described previously, indicating the single phosphorus environment of the PW@IL-GO(1.5) catalyst [46]. The textural information of PW@IL-GO(1.5) was investigated by nitrogen adsorption-desorption at 77 K. As shown in Fig. S2, the isotherms for this sample revealed a Type I with type IV behavior for hierarchical porous materials. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas of it was calculated to 462 m2/g. The large surface area could be due to the introduction of 3D PW anions between IL-GO sheets efficiently limited the face-to-face stacking [47]. The pore size distribution (PSD) was obtained by the nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT), which suggested the presence of micropores and mesopores. Additionally, The morphology of PW@IL-GO(1.5) was investigated by using SEM and TEM. As shown in Fig. S3A, PW@IL-GO(1.5) exhibited thick sheet-like structures with rough surfaces. The TEM image revealed the small dispersed spots (Fig. S3B), which indicate that the PW clusters anchored onto the GO sheets through the positively charged IL layer [48]. Fig. 3 shows the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of GO, IL-GO, HPW and PW@IL-GO (1.5) in N2 flow at room temperature to 700 °C. GO exhibits about 20.2% weight loss in the temperature range of 30–110 °C (Fig. 3A) mainly due to the removal of surface-adsorbed water and 35.5% of weight loss between 120 and 300 °C due to the successive decomposition of the unstable oxygen containing groups (-OH, C–O–C, –COOH) [49]. As can be seen in Fig. 3B, TGA results demonstrated three weight loss steps for IL-GO. The first weight loss approximately 18.2% occurs between 30 and 150 °C due to the evaporation of the absorbed water. The second weight loss about 12.5% occurs between 150 and 250 °C due to the pyrolysis of partly unfunctionalized oxygen containing groups. The third weight loss continued up to 600 °C possibly due to the degradation of residual oxygen groups and IL species. The thermogram of HPW in Fig. 3C exhibits 6.7% weight loss in the range of 30–120 °C due to the removal of adsorbed water, 3.3% of weight loss between 120 and 250 °C due to the removal of crystallization water molecules ([H2O⋯H+⋯OH2]), and 0.8% of weight loss between 400 and 550 °C due to the removal of all acidic protons from the anhydrous H3PW12O40. It is consistent with the loss of constitutional water anhydrous H3PW12O40 to form [PW12O38.5] [16]. Accordingly, in the case of PW@IL-GO(1.5), it begins to lose absorbed water of approximately 6.0% weight below 150 °C. Then, the continual pyrolysis of oxygen containing groups, PW anions and IL moieties (7.1%) occurs in the large range of 150–600 °C. This subsequent gradual degradation process suggests the mutual stabilization of the PW anions and IL cations. Comparing with GO, the full XPS spectrum of IL-GO shows new Br 3d and N 1s peaks at 75.6 and 401.2 eV, respectively, which are related to the IL functionalities (Fig. 4 A, curve a vs. b). The XPS spectra of PW@IL-GO(1.5) exhibits obvious P 2p, W 4f and W 4d peaks along with the disappearance of Br 3d peak, indicating, qualitatively, a total ion-exchange with PW anions. (curve b vs. c). Fig. 3B, C and D depict the high resolution C 1s of GO, IL-GO and PW-IL-GO (1.5), respectively. For GO, the binding energy of 284.6, 285.5, 286.8 and 288.3 eV are assigned to C–C/CC, C–OH, C–O–C and CO species, respectively, which is well consistent with those in the IL-GO and PW@IL-GO(1.5), giving the values at 284.6, 285.4, 286.7 and 288.2 eV, respectively (Fig. 4B vs. C and D). The peak of C–N emerged at 286.1 eV indicates the ring-opening reaction between amidogen in IL and epoxy group [50]. This speculate is also supported by the significant decrease of C–O–C peak at 285.7 eV along with the increase of C–OH peak at 286.7 eV. Hydroxyl and carboxyl groups were obviously preserved in IL-GO. With the introduction of PW anions, almost no changes in the C 1s spectrum of PW@IL-GO(1.5) were observed comparing to that of IL-GO (Fig. 4C vs. D), implying no direct interaction between PW anions and the carbon atoms [50]. Based on the above results, IL-GO was successfully obtained by the functionalization of GO with ILs, followed by the intercalation of PW anions to give PW@IL-GO(1.5)."
8,Catalytic performances,"3.3 Catalytic performances Initially, the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol with H2O2 was employed as model reaction to evaluate the catalytic performance of various catalysts under organic solvent-free condition. The results were summarized in Table 1 . The blank experiment without any catalyst did not show any activity (Table 1, entry 1). Similar result was observed in the reaction carried out with IL-GO at 100 °C for 5 h (Table 1, entry 2). However, homogeneous HPW catalyst was found to be active under the same reaction conditions and gave a moderate benzyl alcohol conversion (57%) and benzaldehyde selectivity (70%) (Table 1, entry 3). This clearly demonstrated that the PW units played a vital role in this oxidation. As expected, great promotion in conversion and selectivity was observed by introduced the PW anions-containing heterogeneous catalysts PW@IL-GO(m) (Table 1 entries 4–7). Particularly, PW@IL-GO(1.5) offered a much higher conversion of 94% with 91% selectivity (Table 1, entry 6), which is comparable to that of some reported catalytic systems (Table S2). The difference of catalytic performance between PW@IL-GO(0.5) and PW@IL-GO(1.0) is not very significant and probably because of the subtle structural difference (Table 1, entries 4 vs. 5). As we mentioned previously, the catalysts PW@IL-GO(0.5) and PW@IL-GO(1.0) were obtained through only anions-exchange reaction, while both PW@IL-GO(1.5) and PW@IL-GO(2.0) were obtained totally anions-exchange and partly amino protonation. Under the same conditions, both PW@IL-GO(1.5) and PW@IL-GO(2.0) behaved more active than PW@IL-GO(0.5) and PW@IL-GO(1.0) (Table 1, entries 6 and 7 vs. 4 and 5). This observation is similar to the previous report [34], possibly due to positive effect of the featured structure of the mixed secondary amino-attached organic cations in both PW@IL-GO(1.5) and PW@IL-GO(2.0). Obviously, the activity of heterogeneous catalysts PW@IL-GO(m) is much higher than that of the corresponding homogeneous counterpart HPW. It was speculated that this result could be ascribed to the following reasons: (1) the IL-cation/heteropolyanion hybrids confirmed advanced catalytic performance directly and dramatically promoted the transformation; (2) the inherent amphipathicity of IL-GO facilitated the mass-transfer efficiency in the water/organic substrate/solid catalyst triphase system; (3) the large specific surface area and layer structure of GO supporter greatly improved the dispersity and accessibility of active sites. Furthermore, the effect of reaction parameters, including catalyst dosage, reaction temperature, time and molar ratio of H2O2 to substrate was investigated, and the results were presented in Fig. 5 . Firstly, an obviously raised conversion of benzyl alcohol (from 43 to 94%) was obtained as the catalyst dosage increased from 0.05 to 0.15 mol %, correspondingly. Further increasing the catalyst dosage up to 0.25 mol% achieved an excellent conversion of 96% but resulted in a slight reduction in selectivity (Fig. 5A). Similarly, in a specific range, the high molar ratio of H2O2 to substrate is favorable for this selective transformation. When the molar ratio of H2O2 to substrate was increased to more than 2/1, the selectivity of benzaldehyde (82%) declined distinctly due to the over-oxidation of benzyl alcohol (Fig. 5B). As shown in Fig. 5C, the conversion of this substrate was strongly affected by reaction temperature, which rose with it varying from 70 to 100 °C (Fig. 5C). Besides, keeping the other parameters constant, the yield of benzaldehyde increased gradually with the reaction time and 94% of benzyl alcohol was converted to the target product within 5 h (Fig. 5D). Regarding the influence of the time, no remarkable change of the conversion and selectivity were observed. The selectivity remained the same even at extended time, possibly due to the complete consumption of H2O2. Based on the above results, we established the optimal reaction conditions, namely: catalyst amount 0.15 mol%, molar ratio of H2O2 to substrate 2/1, reaction temperature 100 °C, and time 5 h."
9,Substrate scope,"3.4 Substrate scope Encouraged by the above satisfying results, the compatibility of PW@IL-GO(1.5) was further evaluated by employing various alcohols as substrates under the optimal conditions. As presented in Table 2 , this catalyst is still active for the conversion of these alcohols, including α-phenethyl alcohol, diphenylmethanol, cyclohexanol, 2-pentanol, and 1-pentanol. Particularly, aromatic alcohols can be more easily converted into the corresponding carbonyl products under the same conditions. For example, α-phenethyl alcohol gave an excellent conversion of 95% with >99% selectivity (Table 2, entry 2). The steric effect was also observed when using a hindered substrate which led to a relatively lower activity (Table 2, entry 3). However, in the case of aliphatic alcohols, especially aliphatic primary alcohols, the low yields of target products were gained because of the inherent inert reactivity of substrates (Table 2, entries 4–6) [51]."
10,Recycling experiments,"3.5 Recycling experiments In view of the heterogeneous nature of the current hybrid catalyst, recycling tests for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol with H2O2 over PW@IL-GO(1.5) was carried out under the optimal conditions. As expected, PW@IL-GO(1.5) can be facilely recycled by filtration or centrifugation, washing with alcohol and vacuum drying. Then, the recovered catalyst was directly used in the next round of experiments. As described in Fig. 6 A, the catalyst can be reused for at least eight times with no evident loss of activity. Meanwhile, the infrared absorption characteristic peaks of recovered PW@IL-GO(1.5) after eight cycles are well consistent with that of the fresh one (Fig. 6B), reasonably indicating its excellent chemical stability in this reaction system. Moreover, the tungsten species is undetectable in the filtrate, revealing no leaching out of PW anions from IL-GO sheets during the reaction. Combined with the excellent activity and selectivity, the good reusability of robust PW@IL-GO(1.5) further show its industrial application potential in oxidation reactions."
11,Proposed mechanism,"3.6 Proposed mechanism Based on the above results and in combination with the previous works [16,22,39], we proposed a plausible mechanism of the selective oxidation of alcohols into carbonyl compounds using PW@IL-GO catalysts in the presence of H2O2. As described in Scheme 2 , the catalytic cycle started with the reaction between H2O2 in aqueous phase and PW12O40 3− of the catalyst PW@IL-GO(1.5), affording the active peroxo-bridged {PO4 [WO(O2)2]4}3− species. Then, the hydroxyl compound in the organic phase was oxidized by the active species to yield the corresponding carbonyl compound with regeneration of the catalyst. In the water/organic substrate/solid catalyst triphase system, on account of the inherent amphipathicity of IL-GO, the developed catalyst presented good catalytic activity for this selective oxidation."
12,Conclusions,"In summary, we reported a series of heteropolyanions-containing ionic heterogeneous catalyst (PW@IL-GO(m)) prepared by protonating and/or anion-exchanging GO-immobilized IL with Keggin HPW. This immobilization methods provided abundant, well-dispersed and stable active sites of PW anions. Then, PW@IL-GO(m) catalysts were applied as promising catalysts for the organic solvent-free synthesis of carbonyl compounds from alcohols using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant. These catalysts exhibited outstanding catalytic activity to give a high conversion of benzyl alcohol (94%) and selectivity of benzaldehyde (91%). Notably, their catalytic performance is superior to that of the homogeneous counterpart because of the advanced structural and chemical properties. More importantly, the catalyst can be readily recovered and steadily reused for at least eight cycles. The excellent reusability could originate from the ionic GO sheets that provide strong cation–anion interactions towards the stable immobilized PW anions. This study offered a practical way to design robust heteropolyacid-based heterogeneous catalysts as promising candidates for the H2O2-based organic oxidation reactions."
