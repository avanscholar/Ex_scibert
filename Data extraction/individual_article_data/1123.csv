0,Introduction,"Biological production of long chain hydrocarbons, including alkanes and alcohols, holds great potential for generating renewable alternatives to petrochemicals. While alkanes can be used as drop-in biofuels (Choi and Lee, 2013; Schirmer et al., 2010), long chain alcohols (> C12) are value added chemicals having significant uses in making detergents, surfactants, lubricants, additives for gasoline, etc. (Cao et al., 2015; Fatma et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2014, 2016; Sheng et al., 2016). The limitation, however, lies at the production level of these molecules. Several different pathways have been explored for microbial production of both long chain alkanes and alcohols, the most common of those being utilizing fatty acid synthesis type I and type II pathways (Fatma et al., 2016; Haushalter et al., 2015). Various well characterized heterologous hosts like Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytica have been used for successful production of a diverse range of chemicals including drop-in transportation fuels (Buijs et al., 2015; Cao et al., 2015, 2016; d’Espaux et al., 2017; Fatma et al., 2016; Runguphan and Keasling, 2014; Xu et al., 2016). Amongst these hosts, E. coli has been the organism of choice for producing these molecules because of the better understanding of its cellular metabolic network in comparison to eukaryotic hosts. Yarrowia lipolytica has been extensively engineered for fatty alcohol and alkane production. It has a very high capacity for lipid synthesis, though diverting this to fuel molecules required extensive rewiring of the acyl-ACP and acyl-CoA metabolism and the decoupling of lipogenesis from the nitrogen starvation response. This modification resulted in yields of 23.3 mg/L alkane and 2.15 g/L fatty alcohol (Xu et al., 2016). Exploiting the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway of E. coli led to the production of odd chain alkanes as well as even chain fatty alcohols. However, even chain alkanes and odd chain alcohols have also been produced in E. coli by heterologously expressing a 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase with specificity for CoA thioesters, i.e., fabH2 from Bacillus subtilis (Harger et al., 2012) and an α-dioxygenase gene from Oryza sativa (Cao et al., 2015), respectively. The highest reported titer for long chain alkane has been 1.3 g/L (44% and 49.4% being contributed by pentadecane and heptadecene, respectively) in the bioreactor using AAR/ADO (acyl-ACP reductase/aldehyde deformylating oxygenase) pathway (Cao et al., 2016). Expression of a different pathway involving type I polyketide synthase and a hydrogenation step has been reported to result in a pentadecane titer of 140 mg/L (Liu et al., 2015). Similarly, different titers for long chain alcohol have also been reported in E. coli via strain engineering and optimization. For example, 6.33 g/L (Liu et al., 2016), 1.99 g/L (Fatma et al., 2016), 350 mg/L (Akhtar et al., 2013) and 750 mg/L (Liu et al., 2014) of even chain length and 1.95 g/L of odd chain fatty alcohol (Cao et al., 2015) has been reported by exploiting the FASII pathway. Various transcriptomic and proteomic approaches have also been exploited for improvement in hydrocarbon production (Cao et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2014, 2016), but a metabolic modeling approach has not been implemented thus far. Metabolic engineering efforts can be greatly facilitated by the use of metabolic modeling, since this allows the researcher to verify that a given strain design could result in a viable cell capable of maintaining essential functions (such as producing precursors for biomass and fulfilling ATP maintenance demand) as well as desired products (Fong, 2014; Chan et al., 2013; Harder et al., 2016; Kim and Reed, 2010). Metabolic modeling is typically divided into kinetic and structural approaches. Kinetic modeling involves describing a metabolic system in terms of its reaction kinetics, stoichiometry and metabolite concentrations. Structural modeling only takes the stoichiometry and reversibility of the reactions into account. Structural modeling is commonly favoured over kinetic modeling, owing to its simplicity regarding model construction and analysis, its scalability to larger metabolic networks, and its insights into the capabilities of the original or engineered networks (Poolman et al., 2003). Several computational methods based on structural modeling have been suggested for guiding strain engineering: e.g. OptKnock (Burgard et al., 2003; Pharkya et al., 2004); OptReg (Pharkya and Maranas, 2006); OptORF (Kim and Reed, 2010); Robust Knock (Tepper and Shlomi, 2010), and FSEOF (Choi et al., 2010). All of these methods use Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) (Fell and Small, 1986; Varma and Palsson, 1993a, 1993b; Watson, 1986), the application of Linear Programming (LP) to metabolic models, to identify candidate reactions (and ultimately genes) for deletion or overexpression. In addition, there are methods based on elementary modes analysis (Schuster et al., 2000; Trinh et al., 2008), and the related Minimal Cut Set (MCS) analysis (Hädicke and Klamt, 2011; Klamt and Gilles, 2004) and methods derived from it, that have been employed for rational optimization of the network for biomolecule production. The various methods have different properties. Several of them can be applied to large genome-scale models, though this can make the results more complex owing to peripheral routes in the network with very limited capacity for carrying flux being proposed as feasible by-passes of potential knockouts. We thus, followed Trinh et al. (2008) in our study in concentrating only on central carbon metabolism where reactions have the capacity to carry significant flux, but instead of elementary modes we employed an FBA based flux constraint scanning method, such as those described by Choi et al. (2010), Hartman et al. (2014) and Poolman et al. (2009), to identify targets for overexpression. We first implemented the overexpression as an additional constraint during in silico analysis, followed by iterative simulation for identification of further gene targets. The proposed strategy was then implemented experimentally for production of alkane and fatty alcohol. Under the controlled condition acquired through fed-batch cultivation, the engineered strains produced 2.54 g/L of alkane and 12.5 g/L of long chain fatty alcohol, the maximum titers of hydrocarbons reported so far in any microbe."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Construction of an E. coli central carbon metabolic model for hydrocarbon production,"2.1 Construction of an E. coli central carbon metabolic model for hydrocarbon production A model of central carbon metabolism of E. coli was constructed to allow heterologous hydrocarbon (alkane, via fatty aldehyde) production based on a previously published E. coli model (Trinh et al., 2008). In contrast to the original model, glucose was assumed to be the only carbon source available during this analysis. Furthermore, the electron transport chain was modified as described by Hartman et al. (2014) and shown in Fig. 1 and Table S2. Reactions for the fatty acid and alkane biosynthesis pathways were incorporated in the model to reflect the production of alkane (pentadecane) in the recombinant E. coli strain (Table S2). The incorporated reactions for fatty acid biosynthesis (FAS) were taken from the EcoCyc database, and those for cyanobacterial alkane biosynthesis, which involved reactions catalyzed by acyl-ACP reductase (AAR) and aldehyde deformylating oxygenase (ADO), were taken from published literature (Cintolesi et al., 2014; Eser et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012; Schirmer et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2013). The model was built according to our standard approach as an assembly of modules as previously described (Hartman et al., 2014; Poolman et al., 2009). The model consisted of a top-level module, which imported the other modules. These are - (A) Automatically generated reactions: gene names mentioned in the published model of Trinh et al. (2008) were extracted and the corresponding reactions retrieved from the EcoCyc database; (B) Biomass module: biomass was written as a lumped reaction where all metabolites required to form 1 g dry cellular weight per hour (gDW h-1) were written in single reaction; (C) Transporter module: transporters were defined for the exchange of metabolites between the cell and environment including glucose, NH3, PO4 2-, and alkane. All transporters were described with the external component on the left-hand side and the internal on the right-hand side, thus ensuring that positive transport flux is consistently interpreted as import into the system, while negative flux represents export from the system; (D) Electron Transport Chain: This module defines a network of coupled reactions which was capable of synthesizing ATP through NADPH/NADH oxidation and proton pumping; (E) Alkane biosynthesis pathway: Since hydrocarbon biosynthesis along with fatty acid pathways were not included in the previous model, a lumped reaction corresponding to a fatty acid synthase producing palmitoyl-ACP formed from Acetyl-CoA, NADPH, NADH, and ATP was incorporated in the model. To synthesize alkane from fatty acyl-ACP, reactions catalyzing reduction of palmitoyl-ACP (C16) to corresponding aldehyde (C16) and its subsequent conversion to alkane (C15) were added; (F) Extra reactions: This module contained reactions that were required in the model but could not be extracted from EcoCyc through the gene-reaction association. In this model, we have assumed that water, protons, and oxygen were present in excess. The model in ScrumPy (spy) and Systems Biology Markup Language (sbml) file format is available at https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4LBWVX8JlHBZDBNblZVbkpuQXc. Common names of all abbreviated reactions and metabolites are given in Table S2. 2.1.1 Model analysis The metabolic network was analyzed by FBA after ensuring that it was consistent in terms of stoichiometry, mass and energy conservation using the methodology described in Gevorgyan et al. (2008) and Poolman et al. (2013). Its ability to represent biomass formation was checked using the model where the objective function was fixed for minimization of the total flux of reactions present in the model while setting the rate of biomass export and bounding exporters of fermentation by-products to only carry negative flux, as summarized in Eq. (1): (1) minimize : | v | ( objective function ) subject to { N v = 0 ( steady − state ) v b i o m a s s =1 ( biomass flux ) − ∞ ≤ v i ≤ 0 ( By − product export ) In the above Equation, v defines the flux vector of reactions present in the network and N represents the stoichiometric matrix of all reactions. 2.1.2 Identification of gene targets for enhanced hydrocarbon production To identify candidate genes for overexpression, FBA was used to force export of alkanes at different rates, while maintaining a constant rate of biomass export (1 g/h), as expressed in Eq. (2). (2) minimize : | v | subject to { N v = 0 v b i o m a s s =1 v p e n t a d e c a n e = J p e n t a d e c a n e − ∞ ≤ v i ≤ 0 Eq. (2) was then repeatedly solved while imposing a fixed flux in the pentadecane transporter between limits of 0 and 2000 µmol (gDW)−1 h-1. The solutions were saved and a dendrogram constructed to visualize correlations between reaction fluxes as described previously (Hartman et al., 2014; Poolman et al., 2009). Genes encoding enzymes that catalyze reactions showing the greatest positive correlation with the pentadecane export flux were considered as candidates for overexpression. This indicated that glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH, encoded by zwf) as a candidate for overexpression. Gene candidates for knockout were identified after incorporating the overexpression of zwf (encoding G6PDH) as an additional constraint as represented in Eq. (3): (3) minimize : | v | subject to { N v = 0 v b i o m a s s =1 v G 6 P D H = x ( G6PDH fixed to twice original value ) − ∞ ≤ v i ≤ 0 The flux dataset obtained was then compared with the dataset before the overexpression was implemented. The reactions that were diverting the carbon fluxes away from acetyl-CoA or hydrocarbon without providing any reducing equivalents or just acting as carbon sinks were considered one at a time for knockout by fixing the flux value of the reaction under consideration to zero in Eq. (3) and checking the effect on alkane production. This was repeated until the maximum theoretical yield of hydrocarbon was achieved. For determining the optimal fraction of carbon source that can be diverted towards pentadecane formation while fixing a certain value of glucose uptake flux, the objective of Eq. (1) was changed from minimization of fluxes to maximization of the pentadecane formation as represented by Eq. (4): (4) maximise : v p e n t a d e c a n e subject to { N v = 0 v b i o m a s s =1 0 ≤ v G l c ≤ x ˆ ( Upper limit of Glc uptake ) − ∞ ≤ v i ≤ 0"
3,"Microbial strains, reagents, and media","2.2 Microbial strains, reagents, and media E. coli and cyanobacterial strains used in the study along with their sources are listed in Table 1. Strains used for preparing phage lysate were procured from the Coli Genetic Stock Centre (CGSC), Yale University, USA. E. coli DH5α strain (Invitrogen) was used as host for performing all cloning work as well as genomic manipulation. For genomic DNA isolation from Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 and E. coli DH5α, DNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen) and Axygen genomic DNA isolation kit were used respectively as per the manufacturers' instructions. Chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Himedia. Standards for alkane, aldehyde and alcohol were purchased from TCI, India, and Sigma-Aldrich. All restriction endonucleases and other enzymes for molecular biology were procured from New England Biolabs (NEB), while Phusion DNA Polymerase for PCR was procured from Finnzymes. Codon optimized synthetic genes for this study were synthesized commercially at Genscript, USA."
4,Strain and plasmid construction,"2.3 Strain and plasmid construction Detailed information about the plasmids used in this study is given in Table 1. Oligonucleotide primers used for making constructs are listed in Table S1. The codon-optimized aldehyde deformylating oxygenase (ado) gene from N. punctiformes was cloned in pZS21mcs (a low copy number plasmid, kanR, tet promoter) and pQE30 (a medium copy number plasmid, AmpR, T5 lac promoter) to obtain pZF16 and pZF17 plasmids, respectively, with the help of primers as mentioned in Table S1. Different constructs for alkane biosynthesis were made as follows - (i) pZF18 was made by amplifying ado and aar genes from genomic DNA of S. elongatus and was cloned in pQE30 at BamHI/SacI and SacI/SalI restriction site, respectively, as an operon; (ii) pZF19 was made by cloning codon optimized ado gene from N. punctiformes and aar from S. elongatus at BamHI/SacI and SacI/SalI restriction sites, respectively, as an operon; (iii) pZF20 containing fused genes were made by first cloning the codon optimized aar gene in pQE30 at SacI/SalI restriction site, followed by cloning of ado gene without stop codon having glycine-serine linker repeated twice (G4S)2 at 3′ end at BamHI and SacI site; (iv) pZF21 containing fused genes was made by first cloning the codon optimized aar gene in pQE30 at SacI/SalI restriction site, followed by cloning of the ado gene without its stop codon and with a glycine-serine linker repeated thrice (G4S)3 at the 3′ end at the BamHI and SacI site; (v) pZF22 having aar and ado genes with their individual T5 promoter and rrnB terminator was made by amplifying ado from pZF17 along with T5 promoter and rrnB terminator sequences and cloning in pZF13 at the XbaI site present downstream to the terminator sequence. For validation of the in silico findings, the plasmids and strains were constructed as follows. The zwf gene was amplified from E. coli DH5α genomic DNA and cloned in the pZS21mcs plasmid at KpnI and HindIII restriction sites to generate the pZF23 plasmid. Gene deletions in DH5α were achieved through the P1 transduction method (Fatma et al., 2016; Mattam and Yazdani, 2013; Munjal et al., 2012). The phage lysate was prepared and enriched by using the single gene knockout strain obtained from CGSC, and the targeted gene was replaced by an FRT flanked-kanamycin resistance cassette. For sequential deletion, the kanamycin resistant marker gene was removed by transforming the strain with a temperature sensitive pCP20 plasmid carrying a flippase enzyme. After removal of the kanamycin cassette, the strain was further used for making a consecutive knockout of genes through transduction. All the gene deletions were confirmed by PCR using primers listed in Table S1."
5,Growth media and cultivation conditions,"2.4 Growth media and cultivation conditions Luria-Bertani (LB) broth with appropriate antibiotics (100 μg/mL ampicillin and 30 μg/mL kanamycin) was used for all cloning and propagation of bacterial cells. For hydrocarbon production, M9 modified medium (Schirmer et al., 2010) supplemented with 2% glucose as a sole carbon source was used. For determining the optimal IPTG concentration for induction of proteins from pQE30 based plasmid, the experiment was performed in presence of various concentration of IPTG (0.0 mM, 0.1 mM, 0.01 mM and 0.001 mM) (Fig. S1), and 0.01 mM IPTG was considered for further experiment. Anhydrotetracycline (100 ng/mL) were used for induction of protein from pZS21mcs based plasmids. All test tube and shake flask experiments were conducted in 15 mL test tubes and 100 mL flasks with a working volume of 3 mL and 10 mL, respectively, under aerobic conditions. For preparing bacterial inocula, glycerol stock placed in − 80 °C was streaked on LB agar plates with the appropriate antibiotics and placed in a 37 °C incubator overnight. A single isolated colony was inoculated in 5 mL LB and grown overnight at 37 °C. The grown culture was used to inoculate M9 modified medium containing 20 g/L glucose, antibiotics, and inducer to achieve an initial OD600 of 0.02 and incubated for 48 h at 30 °C and 180 rpm. To increase the solubility and reduce the evaporation of hydrocarbon, shake flask culture was overlaid by 10% dodecane and flask were sealed by Parafilm. For growth curve and extracellular metabolites analysis, 1 mL of cell samples were periodically collected and used for measurement of optical density at 600 nm and metabolite analysis by GC-FID/GC-MS."
6,Enzyme assay for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH),"2.5 Enzyme assay for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) A spectrophotometric based assay was used to quantify the change in enzyme activity after overexpression of the gene (zwf) for G6PDH. The assay was conducted in 1 mL volume consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), magnesium chloride (1 mM), glucose-6-phosphate (200 μM), NADP+ (100 μM), cell lysate (50 μL, 100 μL, 150 μL or 200 μL). For the preparation of the cell lysates, overnight frozen cells at − 20 °C were resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to maintain a cell density of OD600 ~ 10. Chloroform (50 μL) was added to 250 μL of cell suspension, quickly vortexed for 10 s and an appropriate volume was then added to the reaction mixture to get an optimal increase in optical density (Yazdani and Gonzalez, 2008). The rate of increase in OD340 indicated the production of NADPH from NADP+. One unit of enzyme activity corresponded to the oxidation of 1 μmol of glucose-6-phosphate per min. Cell density at OD600 of 1 corresponded to 0.5 mg/mL of dry cell mass and the total cellular protein corresponded to 50% of the dry cell mass."
7,Analytical techniques,"2.6 Analytical techniques Cell growth was measured via optical density at 600 nm in a 1 mL cuvette using an Ultraspec 3100 Pro spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences). For hydrocarbon (alkane, alkene, alcohol, and aldehyde) analysis, equal volumes of ethyl acetate having 10 mg/L 1-octadecene as an internal standard and culture were mixed by vortexing for 20 min and then centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 rpm. The volatile upper layer was used for analysis and quantification of hydrocarbon. A gas chromatography system (GC 7890 A from Agilent) equipped with an HP-5 column of 30 m length, 0.32 mm internal diameter and 0.25 µm film thickness was used for measurement. The oven program was set as follows: initial 100 °C for 3 min, then the temperature ramped up to 250 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min and held at 250 °C for 10 min. The inlet and detector temperature were maintained at 150 °C and 280 °C, respectively. Further confirmation of products was made through GC-MS analysis using an HP-5 MS column with almost the same program as above except that the final temperature was 300 °C. The MS quadrupole scanned from 50 to 550 m/z. For confirmation and quantification of hydrocarbon, standards from TCI, India were used. For analysis of extracellular metabolites, e.g., glucose, acetate, formate, succinate, lactate, and ethanol, 1 mL cell culture was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 µm membrane filter and analyzed using an HPLC system (1260 Infinity Series, Agilent) equipped with an HPX-87H anion exchange column (Bio-Rad). Filtered and degassed 4 mM H2SO4 was used as a mobile phase at a constant rate of 0.3 mL/min. The column and RI detector temperatures were maintained at 40 °C and 35 °C, respectively. For quantification of liquid metabolites, standards of 1 g/L from Absolute Standards, USA were used."
8,Fed-batch cultivation for long chain hydrocarbon production,"2.7 Fed-batch cultivation for long chain hydrocarbon production For fed-batch fermentation, the inoculum was prepared by growing cells taken from glycerol stock in 5 mL LB in 15 mL test-tubes for 12 h. This culture (1%) was further used to inoculate 120 mL of secondary culture containing modified mineral medium (6 g/L NH4Cl, 8.5 g/L KH2PO4, 1 g/L MgSO4·7H2O, 0.5 g/L citrate, 0.07 g/L CaCl2·2H2O, 15 g/L glucose, 5 g/L yeast extract, 4 mL trace metal and 4 mL of 10 mg/mL thiamine) (Cao et al., 2016) with glucose as carbon source and grown until OD600 reached 3. The grown secondary culture was then used to inoculate a 5 L bioreactor (Applikon) having 3 L of modified mineral medium as described earlier (Cao et al., 2016), except that the glucose used was as a carbon source instead of glycerol. Ampicillin (100 µg/mL) and kanamycin (30 µg/mL) were used as a selectable marker to maintain the plasmid stability. The growth of culture in both seed and bioreactor was performed at 30 °C. The pH in the bioreactor was automatically maintained at 7.0 using 5 N NaOH and HCl. The dissolved oxygen was maintained between 30% and 40% of saturation throughout the cultivation by a cascade of agitation (500–800 rpm) and oxygen-mixed air supply. The culture was induced with 0.01 mM IPTG and 100 ng/mL of anhydrotetracycline soon after the inoculation in the bioreactor. The culture was grown until the glucose concentration in the bioreactor dropped below 5 g/L. Feeding was then started with a sterile solution containing 200 g/L yeast extract, 500 g/L of glucose, 2.47 g/L MgSO4, 2× antibiotics and 1× inducer to achieve 0.2 h-1 of specific growth rate as mentioned earlier (Yazdani et al., 2004) until 18 h of growth. Beyond 18 h, the feed rate was maintained in order to keep the glucose concentration lower than 10 g/L in the culture. For efficient production of long chain fatty alcohol, 5% of dodecane was overlaid upon starting feed as reported previously (Fatma et al., 2016). Samples were collected at regular intervals to monitor growth, glucose consumption and metabolite formation, as mentioned in Section 2.6."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Model properties and consistencies,"3.1 Model properties and consistencies The central carbon metabolism model considered in this study had 74 reactions (45 of which were irreversible) and 61 metabolites and was capable of generating precursor metabolites needed for biomass formation using glucose as the sole carbon source (Fig. 1 and Additional data file 1). The model was analyzed for stoichiometric consistency and biomass formation under aerobic conditions. It was found that out of the 74 reactions, only 36 were responsible for biomass formation. Solutions obtained by forcing a 2-fold increase in glucose uptake flux through the reaction of glucose transporter did not lead to the formation of alkane; instead, glucose was channelled towards lactate and acetate (Fig. S2). Interestingly, we noticed an incomplete TCA cycle as no flux was computed through the reactions catalyzed by α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and succinyl-CoA synthetase, which is consistent with 13C-metabolic flux analysis reported by Chen et al. (2011)."
11,Constraint-based analysis of model to identify target genes for improvement in hydrocarbon production,"3.2 Constraint-based analysis of model to identify target genes for improvement in hydrocarbon production Since simulation of the model of the E. coli metabolic network did not lead to the formation of any alkane, we adopted a constraint-based flux balance analysis to ascertain gene candidate(s) responsible for diverting flux towards hydrocarbon production. We first identified gene candidates for overexpression based on the assumption that the overexpression candidate gene(s) should be those whose flux would co-vary along with the flux through hydrocarbon synthesis pathway. We collected LP (linear programming) datasets of each simulation and plotted bar graphs to visualize the response in flux carried through each pathway (Fig. S3). To visualize the correlation between the reactions, a dendrogram was made as described previously ( Fig. 2) (Hartman et al., 2014; Poolman et al., 2009). In the dendrogram, reactions with a common parent node are exactly correlated and carry flux in a constant ratio. Inspection of the dendrogram shows that the alkane biosynthesis pathway was found to be closely correlated with the reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and the reactions of the lower half of glycolysis (Fig. 2). The same correlation can be seen in the analysis of the LP dataset where an increase in pentadecane output flux led to a rise in glucose uptake and subsequently an increase in the proportion of glucose metabolism through the PPP ( Fig. 3). This phenomenon reflected the fact that alkane production requires more reducing equivalents in the form of NADPH. We found that apart from the PPP, where flux increased by 153%, fluxes also increased through reactions catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase by 278% (Fig. S4). These changes could be directly related to the PPP itself because it provides additional reducing equivalents as well as terminal metabolites which finally merge with the lower half of glycolysis (Fig. 2). From the visualization of the dendrogram, we expected that increase in flux towards PPP would enhance hydrocarbon production; therefore the flux through the first reaction of PPP catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH; shown as overexpression of zwf in Fig. 4) was increased by 2-fold to 15,220 µmol (gDW)−1 h-1 in the model. However, an increase in flux through G6PDH did not lead to an increase in flux through PPP and also did not result in hydrocarbon production. Instead, the flux was diverted through the Entner Duodoroff (ED) pathway, with pyruvate converted back to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) through PEP synthase (PPS). We therefore introduced another constraint by specifying zero flux through the first reaction of the ED pathway catalyzed by phosphogluconate dehydratase (corresponding to deletion of edd) and the reaction catalyzed by PPS, which led to an increase in pentadecane yield to 10.09% of carbon input (Fig. 4). This change in the network, however, also resulted in the formation of lactate from pyruvate which competed for carbon and thus had an impact on hydrocarbon yield. To avoid this competition, we blocked flux towards lactate synthesis (corresponding to deletion of ldhA), which improved alkane yield to 12.37% (Fig. 4). Deletion of the LDH reaction, however, directed to increased flux through the glyoxylate shunt. We, therefore, blocked the first reaction of the glyoxylate shunt catalyzed by isocitrate lyase (ICL, corresponding to deletion of aceA in Fig. 4). The yield of alkane increased to 12.7% of carbon source with the implementation of the aceA deletion, but there was then acetate formation following deletion. Acetate formation was blocked by assigning zero flux to the reactions catalyzed by pyruvate oxidase (POX) and phosphate acetyltransferase (PTA) together, as individual deletion did not reduce acetate formation. This led to an improvement in pentadecane production to 16.34% of carbon source (Fig. 4). We also observed significant formate formation, mainly due to the reaction catalyzed by pyruvate formate lyase (PFL, encoded by pflB). However, blocking flux through PFL reaction did not lead to any improvement in hydrocarbon production (Fig. 4). We performed further validation of the final solution of the constraint-based analysis by changing the objective function from minimization of the sum of reaction fluxes to maximization of flux for alkane production. This was performed by constraining the flux value of glucose uptake to that obtained in the previous solution, using Eq. (4) as mentioned in the Materials and Methods section. We found that a maximum of 17.3% of the glucose could be utilized for alkane production while maintaining synthesis of biomass precursors for growth. Considering the 17.3% utilization of the carbon source as the 100% theoretical maximum yield for alkane formation under the in silico conditions, the 16.34% of carbon diverted towards pentadecane production corresponded to 94.2% of the maximum theoretical yield. Moving towards our goal of achieving maximum yield, we compared the preferred paths through the network in the FBA solutions of the in silico engineered strain with the FBA solution for the theoretical maximum, and found similarity in terms of the preferred glucose metabolism pathway (Pentose Phosphate Pathway), with no fluxes towards the fermentative pathways, the ED pathway and the glyoxylate shunt (Fig. S5). This similarity supported the accuracy of our predicted gene targets for engineering E. coli for improvement in hydrocarbon production."
12,Assembly of the alkane pathway in E. coli,"3.3 Assembly of the alkane pathway in E. coli The implementation of the in silico findings first required an assembly of the alkane-producing pathway in E. coli. We thus assembled a functional cyanobacterial alkane biosynthesis pathway in E. coli by cloning genes for AAR and ADO of S. elongatus in the form of a single operon in a pQE30 vector under the control of a T5 promoter (pZS18). This resulted in production of ~ 20 mg/L of total hydrocarbon (i.e., sum of all aldehyde, alcohol and alka(e)ne of C13–C18 chain length), including 17 mg/L of alcohols and 2.86 mg/L of alka(e)ne ( Fig. 5A), which was in a similar range to previous reports (Akhtar et al., 2013; Coursolle et al., 2015; Howard et al., 2013; Rahman et al., 2014). Long chain fatty alcohol produced here is due to the activity of endogenous aldehyde reductases, mainly YbbO, that convert long-chain fatty aldehyde, a product of AAR, into the corresponding alcohol (Fatma et al., 2016; Howard et al., 2013; Rodriguez and Atsumi, 2014; Schirmer et al., 2010). Although we did observe alkane production in the recombinant E. coli, proving that the assembled hydrocarbon biosynthesis pathway was functional, the amount of hydrocarbon produced was small and needed improvement. It has been reported (Schirmer et al., 2010) that the ADO enzyme from Nostoc punctiformes PCC73102 has a higher activity for long-chain aldehydes compared to the ADO from S. elongatus PCC7942. Therefore, codon optimized genes for the ADO of N. Punctiformes and the AAR from S. elongatus were commercially synthesized and cloned as an operon in pQE30 (pZF19). However, no significant impact on alkane production was observed. Placing these two genes on separate compatible plasmids also did not improve the alkane titer. To understand which of the two enzymes was limiting in the production of alkane, we supplemented each gene in an E. coli expressing both genes in an operon via separate compatible plasmids. Supplementing AAR led to a 3-fold increase in alkane production (8.2 mg/L), while no impact was seen on ADO supplementation (Fig. 5A), suggesting that AAR being the first enzyme in the alkane pathway beyond fatty acid synthesis has much more control over the flux. Although our data did not show significant differences between the ADOs of S. elongatus and N. punctiformes in terms of alkane production, we proceeded further with ADO of N. punctiformes due to previous findings reported in the literature showing its > 2-fold higher activity (Schirmer et al., 2010). Since the product of the AAR enzyme i.e. fatty aldehyde, is a substrate of the ADO enzyme, their co-localization could help in the channelling of the intermediates and higher yield of targeted products. A similar result has also been shown with cellulolytic enzymes through making fusion constructs (Adlakha et al., 2011, 2012). However, making fusion proteins of two different catalytic domains may interfere with proper folding and catalytic activities of each other. Therefore, two fusion proteins, ADO(G4S)2AAR and ADO(G4S)3AAR, were made where glycine–serine linkers of two different lengths were introduced in between ADO and AAR for independent folding and expressed in E. coli. Alkane production was increased to 12 mg/L (4.28-fold higher) and 3.9 mg/L (1.39-fold higher) for strains carrying ADO(G4S)2AAR (pZF20) and ADO(G4S)3AAR (pZF21), respectively (Fig. 5A). This finding was similar to that reported by Rahman et al. (2014) where the use of a glycine-serine linker led a 4.8-fold higher value than the one without fusion. Apart from channelling, equal molar expression of both enzymes in the fusion polypeptide could be another reason for higher alkane production. We made a further attempt to achieve equivalent high-level expression of these two enzymes by cloning their respective genes in medium copy number plasmids with individual T5 promoters and rrnB terminators (pZS22). We observed a 36-fold increase in alkane production to 102 mg/L (Fig. 5A), with total hydrocarbon reaching to 170 mg/L. Pentadecane and heptadecene were most abundant with 48 mg/L of each amongst the alka(e)nes, and hexadecanol (52 mg/L) was most prevalent amongst fatty alcohols, followed by octadecenol (15 mg/L) (Fig. 5B). The results indicated a significant role of vector modulation and individual promoter in guiding gene expression for improvement in metabolite production."
13,Implementation of in silico finding under in vivo conditions,"3.4 Implementation of in silico finding under in vivo conditions Validation of the in silico findings required selection of a suitable E. coli host strain as the genetic background of the host makes a significant impact on the metabolite profiles (Liu et al., 2014; Mattam and Yazdani, 2013; Song et al., 2016). Therefore we compared hydrocarbon profiles in eight different E. coli strains, i.e., E. coli B, DH5α, M15, MG1655, BW25113, Top10, BL21, and JM109, by transforming them with plasmid pZS22 and found that DH5α showed the highest alkane production (Fig. 5B). We thus adopted DH5α as the background host to validate the FBA predictions. 3.4.1 Improvement in long chain alkane production The in silico identification approach to select gene(s) had resulted in a combination of one overexpression (zwf) and seven knockouts (edd, pps, ldhA, aceA, ptaA, poxB, pflB) for the hydrocarbon production in E. coli ( Table 2). The candidate gene overexpression would likely enhance reducing equivalents (NADPH) for hydrocarbon production, whereas the gene deletions would remove fermentation by-products (lactate, acetate, and formate), prevent diversion of glucose metabolism through the ED pathway and enhance the level of acetyl-CoA. To validate the prediction, the native zwf gene from E. coli DH5α was cloned and overexpressed in a low copy number pZS21mcs vector (pZS23); expression and activity were confirmed by Western blotting using an antibody against the His-tag and by measuring glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. DH5α cells overexpressing zwf gene showed 5.5-fold higher activity compared to the wild-type strain (Fig. S6). Further, sequential knockouts of edd, pps, ldhA, aceA, poxB, ptaA and pflB were created in DH5α through phage transduction (Baba et al., 2006; Mattam and Yazdani, 2013). Gene knockouts were confirmed by PCR using external primers unique to the flanking regions of the genes (Table S1, Fig. S7). The deletion up to aceA gene did not impair the growth rate, but deletion of poxB and pflB prolonged the lag phase (Fig. S8). All the engineered E. coli strains, along with DH5α as control, were co-transformed with plasmid pZF23 carrying the gene for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and the plasmid pZF22 carrying the pathway for alkanes and tested for their ability to produce alkane. We found that over-expression of zwf and deletion of edd, ldh, aceA and poxB had a positive impact on alkane production, while deletion of pps, pta and pflB had an adverse impact on alkane production ( Fig. 6A). The alkane accumulation had reached to 279 mg/L (Fig. 6A) in the case of ZFM5 (ΔeddΔppsΔldhAΔaceAΔpoxB). Layering of dodecane in the culture tube further enhanced the alkane titer to 318 mg/L (Fig. S9A), which was 3.1-fold higher compared to the control strain, and 111-fold higher compared to the un-optimized basal strain at test tube level. When the yield predicted via in silico analysis was compared with the experimental value, the strain engineered for alkane production was found to produce alka(e)ne and total hydrocarbon (including alka(e)ne, fatty aldehyde and alcohol) at 19.68% and 27.82% of the theoretical maximum, respectively. 3.4.2 Improvement in long chain fatty alcohol production It was shown earlier that, when producing alkane in E. coli, significant amounts of C16 and C18 alcohols accumulate in the culture medium (Schirmer et al., 2010). This is because the long chain fatty aldehyde produced by the action of cyanobacterial acyl-ACP reductase undergoes a reduction reaction in E. coli to produce the corresponding alcohol. We earlier characterized a long-chain specific aldehyde reductase of E. coli encoded by ybbO carrying out this reaction with the help of NADPH as a co-factor (Fatma et al., 2016). We performed an in silico study for fatty alcohol production identical to that of alkane production and found similar trends in the percentage improvement of fatty alcohol production. Thus all the sequentially mutated strains (ZFM1-ZFM7) were co-transformed with pZF23 and pZF13 (containing the genes for the AAR of S. elongatus) to assess the production of long chain alcohols. The final strain (ZFM7) was also co-transformed with pZF23 and pZF15 (carrying genes for AAR and YbbO) to observe the impact of overexpression of ybbO on long chain alcohol production. The comparison of results of all the engineered strains demonstrated the stepwise improvement in fatty alcohol production after the successive deletions, except for pta deletion, where alcohol titer declined (Fig. 6B). We achieved a maximum fatty alcohol production of 460 mg/L in ZFM7 strain without ybbO overexpression, which was 3.83-fold higher than in the control strain and 773 mg/L of fatty alcohol along with ybbO overexpression corresponding to 6.4-fold higher than basal strain (Fig. 6B). Dodecane layering on the ZFM7+YbbO strain during cultivation led to the production of 1022 mg/L of long chain fatty alcohols at 58.6% of the theoretical yield. The long chain alcohols were mainly composed of hexadecanol (670 mg/L) and octadecenol (203 mg/L) (Fig. S9B). The yield and titer obtained for fatty alcohol were significantly higher than alkane. Since pathway until second last enzymatic step, i.e., up to AAR, is common among both the metabolites, the relatively low titer of alkane could be attributed to the low activity of ADO as mentioned before (Li et al., 2012; Warui et al., 2015). The turn-over number reported for ADO had been 0.11 min-1 (Das et al., 2014) as against 12.39 min-1 reported for YbbO (Fatma et al., 2016) using Octadecanal as substrate."
14,Effect of phospholipid pathway modulation on alkane and fatty alcohol production,"3.5 Effect of phospholipid pathway modulation on alkane and fatty alcohol production The achieved yields of alkane (27.8% of theoretical maximum) and long chain alcohol (58.6% of theoretical maximum) were still significantly lower than the theoretical maximum yield calculated from the model. This could be due to the fact that while we constrained flux towards biomass in the model, this was not done experimentally. When we measured the carbon source going towards biomass and the fermentative products in the parent and the engineered strains, we found that most of the carbon flux was directed towards biomass formation (Table S3). One way to limit flux towards biomass formation is to limit formation of membrane phospholipids. There are two pathways reported in the literature for phospholipid formation: the first one involves the plsB and plsC genes, and the second involves the plsX and plsY genes (Yao and Rock, 2013). The deletion of either plsB or plsC was found to be lethal. The individual deletion of plsX or plsY gene was found to be non-lethal, though a combined double knockout of these two genes has been reported to be lethal (Larson et al., 1984; Yoshimura et al., 2007). In our previous study (Fatma et al., 2016), we have reported that deletion of the plsX gene (responsible for phospholipid biosynthesis by taking fatty acyl-ACP as a substrate) helped in the improvement of fatty alcohol production. Therefore, we knocked-out the plsX gene in the background of ZFM5 and ZFM7 to generate ZFM8 and ZFM9 strains for production of alkane and fatty alcohol, respectively, and checked the overall effect on cell growth and hydrocarbon production (Fig. S10 and Fig. 7). We observed that with plsX deletion, cells took longer time to reach to an OD600 of 12, and the deletion was ultimately helpful in improving the alkane titer by 1.57 fold (280 mg/L to 425 mg/L, Fig. 7A) and fatty alcohol titer by 1.95 fold (773 mg/L to 1506 mg/L, Fig. 7B), reaching to 34.2% and 86.4% of theoretical yield, respectively, for total hydrocarbon. Therefore, as expected from the in silico studies, limiting biomass formation via plsX deletion helped in improving flux towards hydrocarbon production."
15,Microbial production of long chain alkane and alcohol by fed-batch cultivation,"3.6 Microbial production of long chain alkane and alcohol by fed-batch cultivation Fed-batch cultivation is a useful strategy to improve the titer of the final product by growing the cells to high density with the help of substrate feeding under controlled condition (Cao et al., 2015, 2016). We thus performed fed-batch cultivation for the production of alkane and fatty alcohol in 5 L bioreactor using mineral medium with glucose as carbon source. For alkane production, we used the best alkane producing strain in the shake flask, i.e., E. coli ZFM8/pZF22/pZF23, having deletion of edd, ppsA, ldhA, aceA, poxB and plsX genes and overexpression of aar, ado and zwf genes. Cells were initially grown under batch cultivation until glucose concentration reached ~ 5 g/L. The feed was then initiated at an OD600 of 16 as described in the method section. There was a steep rise in cell density up to OD600 of 102 at 30 h, after which it plateaued and reached to maximum of 128 at 66 h. On the other hand, there was a gradual increase in alka(e)ne until 72 h, following which it plateaued. The total accumulation of alka(e)ne ( Fig. 8A) and hydrocarbon (sum of long chain alkane, alcohol and aldehyde) (Table S4) in the culture had reached to 2.54 g/L (6.2% of theoretical yield) and 5.68 g/L (13.4% of theoretical yield), respectively, by 84 h of cultivation, where the major contributions were from heptadecene (C17:1, 55%) and pentadecane (C15, 40%). Throughout the cultivation, dissolved oxygen was maintained between 30% and 40% saturation because it has been reported earlier that oxygen is the co-substrate for ADO enzyme (Andre et al., 2013; Pandelia et al., 2013). A previously engineered strain of E. coli, where the alkane biosynthesis pathway (AAR/ADO) was overexpressed along with the S. elongatus FD/FNR, has produced 1.3 g/L alkane (0.01 g alkane/gDW) (Cao et al., 2016), whereas our model-assisted engineered strain has achieved 2.54 g/L alkane (0.051 g alkane/gDW). Other industrially relevant microbial platforms based on S. cerevisiae (22.0 μg/gDW) and Y. lipolytica (23.3 mg/L) reported in the literatures have been shown to produce much lesser quantity of alkane (Buijs et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2016). Similarly, we have evaluated the performance of the best fatty alcohol producing strain, i.e., E. coli ZFM9, having deletion of edd, ppsA, ldhA, aceA, poxB, pta, pflB, and plsX genes and overexpression of aar, ybbO and zwf genes. Here, the rise in cell density as well as fatty alcohol was gradual until 60 h. The maximum fatty alcohol accumulation reached to 12.5 g/L (0.249 g fatty alcohol/gDW, 22.16% of theoretical yield) after 72 h of cultivation, of which 90% was contributed by hexadecanol (C16, 66%) and octadecenol (C18:1, 24%) (Fig. 8B). The accumulation of fatty aldehydes was found to be negligible (Table S4). The maximum titer reported so far in the literature for fatty alcohol has been 6.3 g/L (Liu et al., 2016). Thus, the highest titers were obtained in this study for both alkane and fatty alcohol, which indicated the strength of combining metabolic modeling for rational strain design for value added chemical commodities."
16,Conclusion,"In this study, we developed a metabolic model of hydrocarbon production in E. coli which was optimized using techniques derived from FBA. To implement the in silico findings, we first optimized the genetic components of hydrocarbon synthesis and identified a suitable host platform, which led to a 36-fold overall improvement in alka(e)ne production. Based on the in silico predictions, an overexpression of a gene and 7 gene knockouts were introduced sequentially into an E. coli DH5α strain, resulting in 273 mg/L alkane production at test tube level representing a 95.4-fold increase over parent strain. Subsequent cultivation with dodecane layering led to the production of 318 mg/L alka(e)ne, an improvement of 111-fold over the basal strain. When the modifications were tested for production of fatty alcohols, 1022 mg/L fatty alcohol was achieved. The hydrocarbon yields obtained in the engineered strains for alkane and fatty alcohol were 27.8% and 58.6% of the theoretical maximum, respectively. We found that the reason for achieving low theoretical yield could be due to the major carbon flux diverting towards biomass formation. We therefore deleted plsX, which increased the alkane and fatty alcohol yield to 34.2% and 86.4% of theoretical maximum, respectively. Finally, cultivation of the engineered strains (ZFM8 and ZFM9) under fed-batch cultivation resulted in the higher titer of 2.54 g/L of alka(e)ne and 12.5 g/L of fatty alcohol, respectively. Our results demonstrate the potential of a combined modeling and experimental approach to the rational design and engineering of microbial hosts for increased biofuel production."
