0,Introduction,"Worldwide, a criterion of cost-effectiveness is forcing most of the industries to focus on reducing the cost in every step of the process design. Especially, chemical industries are concentrating on reducing the costs in steps involving chemical production, yield, purity of products, recovery of catalysts and solvents as well as purity of the recovered or regenerated materials. Separation of chemicals has been the primary focus of all the chemical and pharmaceutical industries where PV separation has received much attention because it is a cleaner and cost-effusive process compared to other conventional methods such as distillation, adsorption etc. The recovery of high purity solvents is possible only when molecular scale separation is achieved from the liquid feeds. High purity alcohols can be achieved by following the dehydration approaches, of which PV stands to be the best method. High purity alcohols such as methanol, ethanol (EtOH), and butanol from fermentation broths are required in pure form, free from trace quantities of water. Of all the methods, PV is the widely explored technique that aids in the selective removal of water during reversible chemical reactions such as esterification to shift the equilibrium towards the product side and also to enhance the bio-conversions in fermentations. It has been realized that the most potential way to fully exploit PV is the development of novel membranes (Shao and Huang, 2007; Dharupaneedi et al., 2019; Kamali et al., 2019). Since the PV process involves selective permeation of one of the components of the feed mixture via dense membrane followed by evaporation at the downstream side of the membrane under reduced pressure. Membranes used in PV applications are classified as a pure polymeric type or mixed membranes that are loaded with inorganic nanoparticles, called nanocomposite membranes. On top of these, purely ceramic membranes are also employed. In a PV process, polymeric or ceramic membrane materials function as the separating barrier by favourably permeating one of the components of the feed mixture upon contact with the mixture. Permeation is a hydrodynamic phenomenon and due to higher affinity or closer diffusibility of the component with the membrane barriers, the separation occurs. The mass transport is driven by the potential chemical gradient across the membrane, which can be accomplished by either applying very low vacuum pressure of 1–3 mm Hg or by sweeping an inert purge gas at the downstream side. These downstream conditions achieve the continuous mass flow by maintaining lower permeate vapor pressure than the partial pressure of the feed liquids (Slater, 1991). PV has been considered to be a better substitute over the conventional energy demanding technologies like azeotropic distillation, adsorption, etc. This could be due to two qualities of the membranes viz., selectivity and eco-friendly nature of the PV process, especially in the absence of toxic liquid entertainers making it environmentally benign (Slater, 1991). Additionally, components <10 wt% in the mixture can be separated efficiently by the latent heat of energy of only the minor component. Thus, mild operating conditions, no disposal to environment and absence of participation of foreign species in the feed proves PV as an advantageous process than any other conventional techniques. This has prompted extensive research to boost the industrial applications of PV for the separation of heat-sensitive biomaterials, azeotropic mixtures and removing the components even at low concentration (Slater, 1991). In addition, PV and its hybrid processes do not involve frequent regeneration of modules and allow the continuous operation with excellent flexibility in designing of the process, making them advantageous over any other techniques and also economically and industrially more viable."
1,History of pervaporation,"1.1 History of pervaporation The word ‘pervaporation’ was first coined by Kober (1917), who used collodion (cellulose acetate) bag to allow fast evaporation of water from the aqueous solution. Later, in 1935, the protein solution was concentrated by using PV technique (Farber, 1935). This has prompted Heisler et al. (1956), in 1956 for the study of dehydration of aqueous ethanol (EtOH) mixtures using cellulose membrane. The underlying principles and the potential of PV process on the separation of organic mixtures were then firmly established by Binning and co-workers (Binning et al., 1961). For the first time, Aptel et al. (1972); Neel et al., 1983) recognized that sorption of one of the components on the PV membrane surface favor the transport of molecules due to the driving force created by the pressure difference. In later year, despite the extensive research efforts on PV separation, the process has faced low economic viability because of low permeation flux. This problem was resolved by Gesellschaft fur Trenntechnik (GFT) Co. in Germany in 1982, who developed a thin layer of cross-linked PVA onto porous poly(acrylonitrile) substrate and used it for the successful dehydration of aqueous EtOH (Huang et al., 2010). Recently, a plethora of membranes have been developed, and used in PV dehydration of alcohols."
2,Pervaporation process,"1.2 Pervaporation process The combination of PV with distillation, called a “hybrid process” appears more beneficial (Slater, 1991). For example, fermentation of bio-waste (renewable energy) results in EtOH and butanol, which are used as bio-fuels. Alcohols can be concentrated only up to 85% using the conventional distillation, but PV can further concentrate up to 99%, which can be recommended to meet the fuel standard. Simplicity, versatility, flexibility, and compactness are some of the other features of PV making it ranked as the third most energy saving technique (Bravo et al., 1986). Hitherto, PV processes find applications in three main areas (Smitha et al., 2004): (i) dehydration of organic solvents, (ii) removal of dilute organic molecules from aqueous streams, and (iii) organic-organic mixture separation. The latter is not the topic of discussion of this review. Among the other approaches, the dehydration of low molecular weight alcohols has been the most critical issue for the successful application of PV. Water being more polar and smaller in size compared to alcohols, can be preferentially dissolved and transported via hydrophilic membranes (synergic effect). On the other hand, preferential transport of organic species through organophilic membranes cannot be achieved with the same degree of efficiency. Such processes are of high demand in the removal of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the industrial and municipal wastewater streams as well as in the fermentation processes for the extraction of inhibitory products such as EtOH, butanol, and isopropanol (IPA) from the fermentation broth to increase the conversion rate. Though the separation of organic-organic mixtures was also studied by PV (Villaluenga and Tabe-Mohammadi, 2000), but this aspect will not be covered here. Research on the separation of polar/non-polar liquid mixtures viz., methanol/MTBE and methanol/toluene has also gained some success in recent years (Doghieri et al., 1994; Yang et al., 1998)."
3,Mass transport processes in pervaporation,"The species penetrated through the membrane change to the gaseous phase from the liquid phase and because of this, PV is quite different from other membrane separation processes. Multiple factors such as nature and structure of the membrane materials, intermolecular interactions between the penetrating molecules as well as with the membrane surface would affect the PV performance. Hence, it is difficult to propose any universal model to describe every detail of the mass transport processes in PV. Nevertheless, two models such as pore flow model and solution-diffusion model have received the wide acceptance in data analysis. Several types of membranes such as dense, porous and thin film membranes have been explored in the literature to develop PV membranes (Fig. 1 ). Their morphological set-up is quite important as it controls the mass transport phenomena and hence, the separation of components via the barrier separation."
4,Pore-flow model,"2.1 Pore-flow model Liquid and vapor transport processes are combined in a PV process to propose the pre-flow model (Okada and Matsuura, 1991). Here, the three fundamental mechanisms involved are: (i) transport of permeate molecules from pore-inlet of the membrane to liquid-vapor phase boundary, (ii) evaporation of the penetrated liquid molecules at the interface, and (iii) transport of penetrants from the interface boundary to the pore outlet of the membrane. The position of change in the phase of permeate is demonstrated by the pore-flow model. Semi-Quantitative evidence of PV membranes for the pore-flow model was first provided by (Okada and Matsuura, 1992). For a single component system, Darcy's equation was used to describe mass transport with respect to molar flux (Q, mol m−2 s−1) (Sukitpaneenit et al., 2010). (1) Q l i q u i d = A δ a ( P 2 − P ∗ ) w h e r e A = π r 4 ρ N t 8 n L M where A is liquid transport parameter (mol m−1 s−1 Pa−1), δ a is length of the liquid filled section of pore (m), P2 and P* are the upstream pressures at the feed side and saturation vapor pressure at the liquid-vapor phase boundary, respectively; r is the mean pore size of the selective surface layer (m), ρ is denthe sity of the liquid (kh m−3), Nt is tot the al number of pores/membrane effective area (m−2), n L is the viscosity of liquid and M is the molecular weight. In the pore flow model, the pores are filled with the vapor molecules forming an adsorption layer on the walls of the pores. Assuming the validity of the monolayer adsorption and Henry's law, and by simplifying, molar flux is expressed as: (2) Q v a p o r = Q s u r f a c e = B δ b ( P ∗ 2 − P 3 2 ) w h e r e B = π ( 2 r t a − t a 2 ) 2 t a N t 8 r R T μ ( k "" H ) 2 For components i and j of the system, by considering the partial pressure of each component as the driving force and assuming that the first evaporation occurs at the pores of the inlet, the mole fraction (Y) of the ith component at the permeate side is given as: (3) Y i , 3 = Q i , v a p o r Q i , v a p o r + Q j , v a p o r = ( P i , ∗ 2 − P i , 3 2 ) ( P i , ∗ 2 − P i , 3 2 ) + B j / B i ( P j , ∗ 2 − P j , ∗ 2 ) However, the pore flow model failed to explain the interaction between the penetrating species and the membrane material, and hence, the model is suitable for membranes that do not swell upon contact with the feed liquid mixture, which is not the case for polymeric membranes. Since this model considers a macroscopic factor like viscosity, membranes with large pores such as ultrafiltration (UF) are widely used while using this model."
5,Solution-diffusion model,"2.2 Solution-diffusion model Solution-diffusion is the most accepted model for investigating PV-based mass transport through dense membranes. It was first proposed by Graham based on his extensive work on the permeation of gaseous molecules through the dense membranes. In this model, mass transport through dense membranes is believed to take place by three fundamental processes: (i) permeate molecules dissolve onto upstream surface of the membrane (sorption), (ii) diffusion of the dissolved molecules through the membrane matrix (diffusion) and (iii) permeate evaporates through the downstream side of the membrane (desorption). Here, desorption is relatively faster than the first two processes. Therefore, sorption and diffusion of molecules are the rate controlling steps. Sorption is a thermodynamically controlled process, while diffusion is a kinetically controlled phenomenon. Therefore, permeability is the product of these two parameters given as: (4) P = D.K Here, P is permeability of the species; D and K are, respectively, diffusion and kinetic parameters of the species in the membrane. Research efforts in PV separation have focussed to develop suitable membrane materials to attain the synergy between diffusion and kinetic parameters, such that the desired membrane separation efficiency can be achieved. The values of diffusion coefficients (D i ) are calculated using: Eq. (5) (Choi et al., 2012): (5) D i = P i K i where P i is permeability, D i is diffusion coefficient (m2/s), K i is sorption coefficient of the ith component inside the membrane (m3(STP)/m3mmHg), subscript i stands for water or IPA. Sorption coefficient (K i ) is calculated as: (6) K i = C i p i where C i is concentration inside the membrane (concentration inside the membrane matrix is considered to be the same as that of permeate concentration) and p i is partial pressure of ith component."
6,Membrane performance parameters,"2.3 Membrane performance parameters From the PV experiments, total permeation flux (J) and separation factor (α) values were calculated using Eqs. (7) and (8), respectively: (7) J = W A . t ( g / m 2 h ) (8) α = P w P o r g F w F o r g where W is weight of the permeate collected in grams (g), A is the effective membrane area in m 2 , t is time in hours (h); P W and P org are wt.% of water and wt.% of organic in permeate, respectively; F W and F org are, respectively wt.% of water and wt.% of organic in the feed mixture. The driving force normalized parameters viz., permeability ( P i G ) and selectivity (α ij ) can be calculated following the suggestion by Baker and Wijmans (2003) according to which permeability ( P i G ) can be calculated as: (9) P i G = D i K i G = j i ( l p i f − p i p ) The permeance ( P i G / l ) can be calculated as: (10) P i G l = D i K i G l = j i p i f − p i p where the subscript i represents either alcohol(s) or water, D i and K i G are the diffusion and sorption coefficients of the ith component, respectively; l indicates membrane thickness, j i is a molar flux of the ith component; p i f and p i p are the ith component vapor pressures of feed and permeate, respectively. Permeability data are generally reported in Barrer units (1 Barrer = 1 × 10−10 cm3 (STP) cm/cm2.s.cm.Hg). By using the flux ( J i ) values in g/m2.h obtained from the PV experiment, molar volume ( v i ) [22.4 l(STP)/mol] and molecular weight ( m i ) of the ith component, the molar flux ( j i ) can be calculated as: (11) j i = ( J i v i m i ) Using van Laar equation, the partial vapor pressure ( p i f ) is calculated as: (12) p i f = x i γ i p i s where x i, γ i and p i s are molar concentration, activity coefficient, and saturated vapor pressure, respectively of the ith component. The saturated vapor pressure, p i s can be by the Antoine equation given as: (13) log p i s = ( A − B T + C ) Here, A, B and C are the Antoine constants obtained from the literature (Baker et al., 2010) and T is temperature in Kelvin. Membrane selectivity can then be calculated as the ratio of permeabilities of components i (water) and j (alcohols). (14) α i j = P i G P j G where P i G and P j G refer to the permeability of water and alcohol, respectively. It may be noted that in the literature, researchers report the membrane performance in terms of flux and selectivity, whose values vary with parameters like temperature, concentration, type of mixture, etc. It is therefore recommended to use the driving force normalized parameters like permeance and selectivity. This will allow a fair comparison between the various membranes."
7,PV membranes for alcohol dehydration,"Most alcohols form constant boiling mixtures with water such as for instance, 4 wt% of EtOH-water mixture and around 12 wt% of IPA-water mixture form the azeotropic mixtures. Traditionally, a third species like benzene or cyclohexane is added to break the azeotropic mixtures. The use of such solvents might leave an impurity in the alcohol, which cannot be used in pharmaceutical industries, where the presence of impurities would retard the reaction progress. In this regard, PV offers an alternative efficient method of meeting this demand. In fact, dehydration of alcohols represents the single largest use of PV-based processes. This review focusses mainly on the dehydration of water-alcohol mixtures covering different types of membrane systems."
8,Inorganic membranes,"3.1 Inorganic membranes High mechanical and thermal stabilities and resistance to harsh chemical conditions are the significant features of inorganic materials over the organic polymers. Also, inorganic membranes render constant flux and selectivity since they do not undergo swelling. They also have the ability to operate at high temperatures and renders high flux comparatively within a smaller area than the polymeric membranes. Nevertheless, inorganic membranes have lesser flexibility and are not cost effective. Ceramics and zeolites are the most commonly used inorganic materials in PV process. Ceramics are non-metallic, hard, wear-resistant, thermally stable and chemically inert materials produced by the action of heat and subsequent cooling. Ceramic membranes are composed of multiple layers supported on a macro-porous ceramic material. It is generally coated by a thin layer of suitable sol, which is formed and stabilized by sintering. Tubular ceramic silica membranes were prepared and used for PV performance (Cuperus and van Gemert, 2002). Dehydration of mixtures including acetic acid, IPA, and butanol was studied. Similarly, α-alumina-coated PVA was used to separate alcohols (Peters et al., 2006). A novel ceramic hollow fiber supported mixed-matrix composite membrane made of RHO-[Zn(eim)2] (MAF-6, Heim = 2-ethylimidazole) nanoparticles and poly(ether-b-amide) (PEBA) was fabricated via a facile dip-coating approach (Liu et al., 2019). These membranes have shown a remarkable flux of 4446 g/m2 h and a separation factor of 5.6 for a feed of 5 wt % EtOH/water at 60 °C. Recently, Liu et al. (2019), used polyamide (prepared by reacting 1,3-diaminopropane and trimesoyl chloride) coated TiO2 modified ceramic hollow fiber membrane for the dehydration of IPA. The TiO2 interlayer provided a smooth and defect-free layer for the binding of the polyamide layer. Various membrane preparation parameters like monomer concentration, immersion time in the aqueous phase and contact time were investigated. The membrane prepared under optimized conditions showed a PV separation index (PSI) value of 7.83 × 107 with a separation factor >12,000 and permeate flux of 6.44 kg/m2 h for PV dehydration of 90 wt% IPA at 60 °C. Thus, there was no change in the membrane performance even after several cyclic operations. Zeolites are another class of inorganic materials that are extensively studied for PV dehydration. Zeolites are mainly crystalline alumina-silicates that render separation of liquid mixtures at the molecular level by adsorption and diffusion. Zeolite membranes do not swell and possess macro-pores, which form the basis for transportation of molecules corresponding to their size. Also, zeolite membranes have gained a high significance at operations over a wide range of temperature and pH conditions. More than 14 different kinds of zeolite-based membranes have been reported for PV (Peters et al., 2006). Of these, membranes prepared by zeolite NaA, X, and Y, exhibited excellent separation performance for alcohol dehydration (Kita et al., 2000; Shah et al., 2000). Impact of support layer on zeolite nucleation was also examined (Chau et al., 2000) to observe that the nucleation process is hindered by the presence of impurities and contaminants like carbon and sulfur. Van den Berg et al. (2003), employed zeolite A having Si/Al ratio to synthesize on a metal support coated with UV irradiated TiO2 and it was found that exposure of hydroxyl groups to UV irradiation improved the hydrophilicity of TiO2-coated support and increased the interaction between zeolite and the support, which resulted in high-quality membranes. A range of tubular supports having different Al2O3 contents was used as supports to prepare NaA zeolite membranes hydrothermally (Kondo et al., 1997). With an increase in alumina content, permeability increased, but a membrane with 70 wt% was found to be optimum. Okamoto et al. (2001), prepared alumina supported NaA zeolite membranes and evaluated their performance for the dehydration of methanol, EtOH, and dioxane. Morigami et al. (2001), reported the industrial use of zeolite membranes for EtOH dehydration for the first time to observe 420 kg h−1 of 99.8 wt% purity EtOH produced from the solution mixture of 90 wt% EtOH. The crystallization of NaY zeolites was facilitated by developing zeolite membranes for alcohol dehydration aided with and without ammonium fluoride medium (Zhang et al., 2014). NaY zeolites prepared under ammonium fluoride medium showed better flux and separation factor for EtOH/water and butanol/water mixtures. Overall, NaA zeolite membranes were reported with greater efficiency than the hybrid silica membranes. A detailed study on mechanical strength, optimization on chemical composition and upon fine-tuning of pore structures by altering the sol components and preparation conditions, Pervatech BV (a company from Netherlands) has developed HybSi™ membrane and used it for alcohol dehydration (Shao and Huang, 2007)."
9,Polymeric membranes,"3.2 Polymeric membranes The effortless film forming ability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness are the promising factors to use organic polymers for the PV process. Availability of a considerable number of sorption centers is more critical for the membrane to be useful in PV dehydration (Semenova et al., 1997). Water-selective sorption is allowed by the functional polar groups because of ion-dipole, dipole-dipole, and hydrogen bonding interactions between the water molecules and the membrane surface. Additionally, the torturous free volume of membrane credits for enhanced the water diffusion selectivity. Hence, the selection of membrane with any one of these characteristics is more important to achieve a better selectivity. 3.2.1 Alginates Alginate or alginic acid is an anionic polysaccharide made up of co-polymerization of two acid residues viz., α (1–4) linked L-guluronic acid and β (1–4) linked D – mannuronic acid. It is a naturally occurring bio-polymer obtained from cell walls of brown algae. Some of the attractive features of this polymer include hydrophilicity, good film-forming ability, flexibility, easily modifiable functional groups. Hence, NaAlg-based membranes are one of the frequently tested polymers in alcohol dehydration applications (Bhat and Aminabhavi, 2007a). Different sodium alginate (NaAlg) membranes used for PV dehydration performances are summarized in Table 1 . Yeom et al. (1996), made some initial efforts to use NaAlg-based membranes for PV dehydration of alcohols. They concluded that flux decline with temperature is due to the relaxation of polymer chains upon heating. Membrane swelling was decreased by using glutaraldehyde as a cross-linker, but with a concomitant reduction in flux and selectivity. Due to uncontrolled swelling nature, Na-Alg membranes have lesser mechanical strength but still found to offer promising PV performance (Huang et al., 1999a). Cross-linking of Na-Alg with metal ions like Na+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, Fe2+ and Al3+ can be established to be the better approach to address the problems associated with such uncontrolled swelling. For instance, cross-linking with Ca+2 ions is found to offer improved flux, selectivity as well as reduced swelling. Kurkuri et al. (2002), blended Na-Alg with PVA to prepare the blend membranes with comparatively higher flexibility. Increase in PVA concentration increased the flux of the membrane along with selectivity. In the same way, NaAlg was blended with poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) at different concentrations using phosphoric acid as a crosslinker Kalyani et al. (2006). The study concluded that 3:1 ratio of NaAlg: PVP was optimum. Polyethyleneimine (PEI)/NaAlg membranes were also studied for EtOH dehydration at lower pH (Li et al., 2018). PEI and NaAlg were deposited onto the ultrafiltration membrane of PAN by layer-by-layer (LBL) technique. Membranes with multilayers showed a better performance where ionic cross-linking between COO- groups of NaAlg and NH2 groups of PEI played a significant role in PV, resulting in the highest separation factor of 1542 and permeate flux of 1.203 kg/(m2 h). It is observed that ionic crosslinking increased with the diffusion of H+ ions when protonation of NH2 to NH3 + on PEI occurs. Authors were successful to prepare acid resistant PV membranes. PEG functionalized polyoctahedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes nanoparticles were loaded onto alginite matrix in high concentration (Wang et al., 2017a). Optimum performance membrane offered a permeation flux of 2500 g m−2 h−1 and separation factor of 1077. These authors successfully overcame the efficiency problems associated with high nanoparticle loading. 3.2.2 Chitosan Chitosan is a linear polysaccharide with polar functional groups that have an extensive range of modification choices; it is known for its biocompatibility (Veerapur et al., 2007; Aminabhavi et al., 2017; Aminabhavi and Dharupaneedi, 2017). Published reports on chitosan-based PV membranes for alcohol dehydration are listed in Table 2 . Chitosan swells uncontrollably in an aqueous medium due to its hydrophilic nature, thereby leading to decreased performance as well as mechanical and thermal instability (Feng and Huang, 1997; Devi et al., 2005). Various efforts have been made to develop a chitosan membrane with controllable swelling and improved flux and selectivity. Initially, two-step modifications were performed on chitosan to generate carboxylic acid group functionalities and to improve its performance (Zhang et al., 2007). The first step involved the cross-linking of chitosan with glutaraldehyde, while in the second step, cross-linked chitosan was treated with maleic anhydride. These two steps resulted in a simultaneous increase in both flux and selectivity. Chanachai et al. (2000), attempted blending technique to improve the performance of chitosan membrane. Chitosan/hydroxyl ethyl cellulose (HEC) membrane was prepared using 3:1 and 9:1 ratio to observe increased flexibility with an increase in HEC content to offer high flux and selectivity. Jiraratananon et al. (2002a, b) used the cellulose acetate as porous support and prepared chitosan membranes by phase inversion technique. A mixture of urea, formaldehyde and sulphuric acid was used to cross-link the membrane, which gave a better PSI than the pristine membrane. In another study, two different modified chitosan membranes were prepared by Shieh and Huang (1997), for EtOH dehydration. A blend of polyelectrolyte consisting of chitosan and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) was the first type, which was supported onto the polysulfone membrane. A mild heat treatment enhanced the interactions between amino groups of CS and acid groups of PAA. Membrane supported onto polysulfone gave a consistent flux over different temperatures due to the thin active layer on the surface of the composite. Nam and Lee (1997), also prepared the same membrane in an oven at 30 °C for 24 h and were stable up to 200 °C making possible for operation at higher temperatures with moderate selectivity. This was due to polyelectrolytic nature as well as the interactions between PAA and CS. The authors also prepared the CS composite membrane using poly(ether sulfone) support (Lee et al., 1997). But, these showed lower performance than the ones reported by Shieh and Huang (1997). With increased cross-linking, flux declined for EtOH dehydration and hence, the membrane was tailored to attain improved dehydration. It was found that with increasing cross-linking time, flux declined, and this proved the way to tailor membranes by varying the cross-linking time. Huang et al. (1999b), found that before casting, immersion of PSF support in a hydrophilic binding agent enhanced the membrane performance. This is because immersion could increase the surface binding capacity of chitosan onto PSF due to bound hydroxyl functional groups. Thus, CS and PVA blends were prepared with different ratios of 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3 (Svang-Ariyaskul et al., 2006). Thermal cross-linking was first employed, and then glutaraldehyde and sulphuric acid were used for further cross-linking. The CS/PVA with 3:1 ratio gave better flux with high selectivity. Similarly, chitosan/PVA blends were prepared in different ratios of 20, 40 and 60 wt% of PVA (Rao et al., 2007), but cross-linking was done using urea and sulphuric acid, and membranes were prepared by a solution casting method. Here, the increase in PVA increased the flux, but decreased the selectivity. CS/poly(tetra-fluoroethylene) (PTFE) membranes were prepared by Liu et al. (2007), for IPA dehydration. Wettability of PTFE was enhanced by plasma grafting of its surface using poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PSSA) using γ (glycidyloxy propyl) tri-methoxysilane (GPTMS) as a cross-linker; these membranes were stable even after 45 days of continuous PV degradation of IPA-water mixture. Recently, Kononova et al. (2019), prepared self-supporting polyelectrolyte complex membranes by the sequential layering of sodium hyaluronate and chitosan of different orders. The membrane achieved almost 100% selectivity for the feed containing 5% water in EtOH. 3.2.3 Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) PVA-based membranes have been the most widely studied membranes in PV dehydration of alcohols due to their better elongation ability, hydrophilicity, tensile strength, flexibility and most importantly superior abrasion resistance. However, like many other membranes, PVA membranes also face a swelling problem when in contact with aqueous solutions resulting in lower selectivity. Grafting and cross-linking have been attempted to overcome the swelling issue (Das et al., 2011). The earliest commercial PVA membranes prepared were cross-linked. Further research resulted in the development of innumerable PVA-based commercial membranes whose blends/composites are compiled in Table 3 . Use of PVA membranes for PV dehydration was first attempted by Shao and Huang (2007). Amic acid for PVA cross-linking and PV dehydration efficiency was examined for EtOH dehydration; at 45 °C, 0.25 kg/m2h of flux and separation factor of 100 were obtained for a 50 wt% mixture. This success has inspired many researchers to focus on PVA membranes for PV dehydration. Impact of charged co-polymerization on PVA membrane performance was also studied by Praptowidodo (2005). The PVA–co-itaconic acid and PVA–co-N-3-trimethyl ammonio-propyl-acrylamide-chloride membranes were synthesized and cross-linked using glutaraldehyde. This modification allowed increased selectivity but decreased flux due to reduced swelling. The consequences of PVA hydrolysis on PV dehydration of alcohol was studied by Lee and Hong (1997). The degree of hydrolysis was directly proportional to the separation factor and inversely to the flux. Membrane crystallinity increased with increase in the degree of hydrolysis rendering high resistance for mass transport, but an increase in OH groups enhanced the selectivity. Membrane hydrophilicity was also increased by inducing COOH functionalities onto PVA membrane surface using mono-chloro acetic acid (Yong et al., 1990). Interpenetrating network (IPN) of PVA and poly(acrylamide) (PAAm) were also synthesized by Liang and Ruckenstein (1995). These blends gave a separation factor of 4100 and a flux of 0.1 kg/m2h for 5 wt% water/EtOH mixture due to good water sorption ability of PAAm; PAAm incorporation into PVA increased the thermo-mechanical property. Further, the authors used poly(ether sulfone) (PESf) support for the membranes to improve the dehydration performance (Liang and Ruckenstein, 1995) and have succeeded to get a thin active layer of 4 μm thickness, which gave a constant high flux even at longer runs. Cyclodextrin/PVA composite membrane of 1:2 ratio was developed by Yamasaki et al. (1994), which showed increased selectivity, but no change in flux was observed. With the addition of cyclodextrin, free-volume for flow through the membrane was reduced. Poly(NN-isopropylacrylamide) was grafted onto PVA membrane to develop heat-sensitive membranes (Sun and Huang, 1996). These membranes remained stable up to 32 °C and above which selectivity decreased drastically. Modification of PVA membrane surface using a plasma technique, where plasma polymerized acrylic acid or allyl alcohol layer were used to cover the PVA surface (Rafik et al., 2003). At first, membranes were immersed in EtOH/water mixture for 30 days and then used for PV. The acrylic acid grafted membrane was found to be more stable than the other one. However, in comparison with the nascent PVA, flux and selectivity of both the membranes did not significantly improve. A natural protein, such as serin was blended with PVA and used for the PV dehydration of EtOH/water mixture (Gimenes et al., 2007). Amino acid groups and hydroxyl functional groups of serin contributed to increase in hydrophilicity of the membranes; thus, serin was effective in improving the PV performance. Many recent exciting works have been published on PV dehydration of alcohols. For example, PVA/graphitic carbon nitride hybrids for 90 wt% methanol/water PV systems were developed (Wang et al., 2018b). Three types of graphitic carbons and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), activated g-C3N4 (O-g-C3N4) and polydopamine modified g-C3N4 (PDA@O-g-C3N4) nano-sheets were embedded into PVA to study alcohol dehydration. When the polymer/inorganic interface was changed from hydrogen bonding to rigid and flexible chemical bonds, the overall flux decreased from 4634 to 2328 g/(m2h), while the separation factor increased from 32.4 to 57.9. A group of researchers investigated the cross-linked PVA membrane for EtOH dehydration near the glass transition temperature (Liu and Kentish, 2018). The solubility of EtOH-water mixture in the membrane was measured individually, and the experiments were analyzed by perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT). The authors concluded that heat of sorption of water and EtOH remained constant throughout the temperature range, but water permeability decreased with an increase in temperature, signifying the solubility-controlled transport behavior."
10,Mixed matrix membranes,"3.3 Mixed matrix membranes High selectivity, permeability, excellent durability, and economic viability are the most essential characteristics of an ideal PV membrane. As previously discussed, inorganic membranes offer good mechanical stability and high performance. In this context, inorganic materials incorporated into organic polymeric matrix render synergistic characteristics of both organic and inorganic membranes (Zimmerman et al., 1997; Rybak et al., 2017a, 2017b). Control over the composition of polymer and fillers, changing the filler morphology and use of different processes for membrane treatment offers a new type of membrane material (Magalad et al., 2011; Rybak et al., 2014, 2018a, 2019; Aminabhavi et al., 2009). These inorganic fillers are of three major classes, such as porous, non-porous and nanomaterials. Porous fillers benefit the membranes in separating molecules with high selectivity on the basis of their size as well as shape and act as molecular sieves. The higher amount of pore fillers increases the selectivity via increased adsorption and selective flow mechanism. Also, diffusion of small water-like molecules is favored by the torturous diffusion paths created by the non-porous inorganic fillers. The nano-fillers would help to attain the necessary properties at a relatively lower concentration. The efficiency of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) is dependent upon the compatibility between the filler and the organic polymer matrix material as well as removal of interfacial defects. 3.3.1 Clay Smectic clays are a class of layered silicates, where alumina octahedra are sandwiched between two sheets of silica tetrahedra, which are interconnected by sharing O2− atoms at the polyhedral corners and edges (Chen et al., 2008). Sodium montmorillonite (Na+MMT) clay was loaded onto the alginate membrane and used for PV process for the dehydration of IPA, 1,4-dioxane, and tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Bhat and Aminabhavi, 2006a). The 5 and 10 wt% Na+MMT-loaded membranes were prepared that increased the separation factor with a moderate flux. Likewise, Adoor et al. (2006), loaded Na+MMT into PVA matrix to observe similar performance. The water-selective channels of Na+MMT and its hydrophilic nature facilitated selective water transport. Suhas et al. (2014a), further enhanced the performance of clay composite membranes by treating clay with para-toluene sulfonic acid (p-TSA). The p-TSA treatment etched the surface of clay, as a result, both surface area and hydrophilicity has increased. As a consequence, the p-TSA composite membrane showed 140% increase in selectivity compared to the pristine clay composites for the dehydration of IPA. 3.3.2 Zeolites Zeolites are the micro-porous alumina-silicates serving as molecular sieves. Their action is prominent in selective adsorption and enhancing differential diffusion rate, mechanical and thermal stability. Zeolite 4A was incorporated into Na-Alg matrix and tested for IPA dehydration by Sudhakar et al. (2011). Both permeability and selectivity were increased by the zeolite loading. In the same manner, H-ZSM-5 was loaded onto CS membranes and found to offer superior performance for EtOH dehydration (Sun et al., 2008). Impact of Si/Al ratio in zeolites was also studied and concluded that zeolites with a lower ratio of Si/Al possess greater H-bonding interaction and reduce the number of non-selective voids to give more selective water permeation. The same zeolite was incorporated into the PVA matrix that after an increase of alumina content, separation factor was increased (Suhas et al., 2014b). Bhat and Aminabhavi (2007b), succeeded to load K-LTL zeolite into NaAlg MMM and used them for the dehydration of IPA along with other organics such as 1,4-dioxane and THF. Hydrophilic nature of the zeolite resulted in a parallel increase of flux as well as separation factor. Qiao et al. (2006), analyzed the effect of zeolites on membrane performance. Zeolites 5A and 13X were loaded onto P84 co-polyimide membranes; membranes with 13X zeolite gave a better performance due to their higher pore sizes, larger pore-volumes, and superior adhesion. Mosleh et al. (2012), used different concentrations of zeolite 4A and ZSM-5 as fillers for Matrimid-5218. Membranes with zeolite 4A gave better performance compared to ZSM-5/Matrimid membranes. A matrimid membrane with 20% hydrolyzed PIM-1 gave a high flux of 47.8 g/m2h and a separation factor of >5000 for the dehydration of 1-butanol (Yong et al., 2017). Various amounts of magnetite (Fe3O4) and 4 different crosslinking agents were used, i.e., calcium chloride (AlgCa), phosphoric acid (AlgP), glutaraldehyde (AlgGA) and citric acid (AlgC) (Dudek et al., 2017) to develop novel membranes. Based on fractal parameters characterizing self-similarity, most effective alginate membrane for EtOH dehydration was determined. The authors concluded that the degree of multifractality is the better parameter to find different structural properties and predictable performances. A novel seeding method was also developed to prepare silicalite-1 membrane onto tubular silica support with high PV performance using zeolite-dispersed polymer film (Ueno et al., 2018). These membranes gave a flux of 3.16 kg m−2 h−1 and a separation factor of 120 for 10 wt% EtOH/water mixtures at 50 °C. The method was straight forward and has immense applications on industrial scale operation. Without the aid of nano-seeds zeolite NaA dense membranes were prepared (Ma et al., 2018). Dense zeolite NaA membranes mullite‐containing alumina hollow fibers gave the highest flux of 10.8 kg m−2 and a separation factor of over 10,000. The nucleation and growth of the zeolite have been promoted by the hydroxyl groups of mullite‐phase, resulting in dense membranes. The MFI zeolite membranes were tested for the separation of EtOH and water by eliminating the surface SOH groups by a simple dopamine modification (Wu et al., 2018). Dopamine modification eliminated the effect of silanol and improved long-term separation stability. 3.3.3 Hetero-polyacids (HPA) Hetero-polyacids (HPAs) are polyoxometalate inorganic compounds having good hydrophilicity and are composed of tungsten, molybdenum or vanadium. Phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) was incorporated into the PVA membrane matrix and membranes were evaluated for the PV dehydration of IPA (Teli et al., 2007). Selectivity of around 90,000 was obtained for the membrane loaded with 7 wt% of HPA. The PVA-PVP membranes were loaded with PMA and examined for the dehydration of EtOH/water mixture (Magalad et al., 2010a). Membrane containing 4 wt% of PMA gave the separation factor of 8206. On the other hand, Preyssler type HPA-loaded NaAlg membranes gave the separation factor of 59,000 (the highest) for EtOH-water dehydration (Magalad et al., 2010b). Similar types of membranes with a better dispersion of particles showed a higher saturation limit for HPA loading and offered increased performance for 10 wt% IPA/water mixture (Mali and Gokavi, 2012). 3.3.4 Titanium dioxide (TiO2) Most common photocatalyst and widely used pigment material in paint and coating industries is TiO2. Since titania is hydrophilic, it has attracted the attention of many researchers for its use as a filler to develop PV membranes. The 21 nm-sized titania was incorporated into the PVA matrix and used for PV dehydration of IPA (Sairam et al., 2006). Yang et al. (2009), prepared CS/titania membranes by a sol-gel process, where tetra butyl titanate was used as a chelating agent. Membranes with 6 wt% loading of titania were found to be highly saturated. Upon comparison between CS/TiO2 membranes prepared by the blending method and the ones prepared by the in-situ sol-gel method, the latter membranes gave better performance. Titanate nanotubes were also prepared by hydrothermal method and were modified using poly(aspartic acid) and then embedded into CS (Liu et al., 2011). These hybrid membranes (MTNT/CS) were supported over polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and examined for the dehydration of IPA. High flux of 1498 g/m2h and separation factor of 6237 were obtained for the membrane with 6 wt% of filler and the membrane was tested for 10 wt% water in IPA mixture at 80 °C. The authors continued to develop PAN supported hollow TiO2 nanoparticles loaded into chitosan by physical blending. These membranes showed a substantial increase in membrane performance for alcohol dehydration compared to their unmodified counterparts. 3.3.5 Mesoporous materials Mesoporous materials have pore sizes varying between 2 and 50 nm. These kinds of mesoporous materials were used as fillers for PV dehydration of IPA to achieve separation factor of 30,000 by loading with MCM-41 into NaAlg matrix (Bhat et al., 2006a). Conversely, Fe-SBA-15 of slightly higher hydrophilicity gave almost 100% selectivity (Bhat and Aminabhavi, 2006b). Likewise, the separation factor of 70,000 was obtained for 20 wt% AlPO-5 loaded membrane (Bhat et al., 2006b). Higher separation factor and selectivity values are attributed to their large surface area and hydrophilicity nature of the membrane. 3.3.6 Zeolite imidazolate framework (ZIF) ZIFs are made of tetrahedral metal ions bridged by imidazolates and are sub-class of metal-organic framework. ZIF is attractive fillers due to high chemical and thermal stability as well as superior porosity. Different concentrations of ZIF-7 crystals were loaded into chitosan, and ZIF-7/CS MMMs were prepared by Kang et al. (2013). The membrane prepared with 5 wt% loading of ZIF-7 showed the optimum performance with about 19-times higher selectivity than the nascent CS membrane. Alcohol-water induced swelling of polybenzimidazole (PBI)/ZIF-8 membranes was studied by Shi et al. (2013). The decrease in swelling was observed with an increase in ZIF loading due to the ZIF's hydrophobic nature. Higher fractional free volume (FFV) formed by large cavities of ZIF-8 increased the permeation rate as confirmed by positron annihilation studies. Hybrid membranes of 2D ZIF-L nano-sheets and zero-dimensional ZIF-8 nanoparticles were prepared with NaAlg (Liu et al., 2017a). The ZIF-L filled membrane gave a permeation flux of 1218 g/(m2 h) and separation factor of 1840, whereas ZIF-8-filled membrane displayed a permeation flux of 879 g/(m2 h) and a separation factor of 678. Ordered water channels are formed with ordered alignment and regular apertures of ZIF-L that gave suitable molecular sieving effect and showed better performance than the ZIF-8 filled hybrid membranes. Polyimide-based ZIF-8 and mesoporous MCM-41 silica spheres of different size impregnated MMMs were prepared (Kudasheva et al., 2015). MCM with lesser size gave better flux than the higher sized filler with no significant difference in the separation factor. The effect of surface modification of ZIF-90 upon dispersion into P-84 and performance of ZIF-90/P-84 MMMs for PV dehydration of IPA was studied by Hua et al. (2014), wherein 20 wt% of ZIF-90 loaded into P-84 membranes to observe the optimum concentration of fillers that showed a separation factor of 5432. The nano-structured ZIF-8 is another class of ZIF, which was synthesized and incorporated into PVA matrix at different concentrations and used for IPA dehydration (Amirilargani and Sadatnia, 2014). The 5 wt% of ZIF-8 in PVA membrane showed the best PV performance, which is almost five-times higher than that of the nascent PVA. Viscosity-driven in-situ self-assembly of ZIF-90 was used as a cross-linker to PVA and the optimized membrane gave a flux value of 268 g/m2 h and a separation factor of 1379 for the PV dehydration of 90 wt% of aqueous EtOH solution at 30 °C (Wei et al., 2018). ZIF-71 possesses super hydrophobic pore channels and flexible pore architecture, which was used as a filler for recovering alcohols from fermentation broths. PDMS membrane filled with ZIF-71 in 10:2 ratio has shown a quite good performance in recovering IPA compared to pristine PDMS membrane. ZIF-71 was also incorporated in polyether-b-amide and used for separating biobutanol, an alternative source of fossil fuels (Liu et al., 2013). The graphical representation is shown in Fig. 2 . ZIF-71 is found to have excellent compatibility and organophilicity with the polymer matrix and was able to give better efficiency. 3.3.7 Nanotubes Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are known for their mechanical, thermal, optical and electrical applications owing to their potential in many applications like catalysis and materials engineering (Rybak et al., 2018b). Different concentrations of functionalized (oxygenated) CNTs were loaded onto the PVA matrix by Shirazi et al. (2011), and PV dehydration of IPA was examined. These studies revealed that 2 wt% of CNT in the PVA membrane matrix showed a better separation factor of 1794 than the nascent PVA for which separation factor was 119. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were wrapped with poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) to enhance their dispersion into the PVA matrix, and their performance for PV dehydration of IPA was tested to show comparatively improved performance (Amirilargani et al., 2013). Also, amine-functionalized MWCNTs were incorporated into PAA/CS blend matrix to obtain a flux of 78.29 kg m−2 h−1 and a separation factor of 99.5 for the membrane loaded with 15 wt% of nanotubes (Langari et al., 2018). Similarly, single-walled alumina-silicate nanotubes have better compatibility up to 40 wt% with the PVA matrix, resulting in a superior membrane performance (Kang et al., 2012). Amine functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes were also incorporated into P84 polyimide with the aid of 1,6-hexanediamine (HDA) as a cross-linker (Davood Abadi Farahani et al., 2018). Cross-linked membranes consisting of 2 mg/g of nanotubes gave water, EtOH, and IPA permeances of 16.4, 3.3 and 1.4 LMH/bar, respectively at 20 bars of pressure. The CNT was modified by synthesizing TiO2 and hybrid membranes of PVA were prepared that gave a flux of 0.0388 and a separation factor of 805 (Panahian et al., 2015). Whereas, PVA/modified CNT-TiO2 gave lower flux and separation factor. Modified CNT/PVA membranes were better crosslinked due to esterification reaction between hydroxyl groups of PVA and carboxyl groups of MWCNTs and hence, its performance decreased. 3.3.8 Graphene In recent years, the use of graphene oxide (GO) as a filler has attracted much interest, since it is known to produce a dramatic improvement in the mechanical and barrier properties of the derived membrane even if present at very low concentrations (Huang et al., 2012). The GO-derived from graphene nanosheets is quasi-two-dimensional honeycomb lattice type structures with oxygen-containing functional groups on their basal planes and edges, such as hydroxyl, epoxide, carbonyl and carboxylic acid (Allen et al., 2010). These functional groups can be effective to improve the interfacial bonding between GO sheets and the polymer matrix, thereby uniform dispersion can be achieved when embedded in the polymer matrix (Kuila et al., 2012). Suhas et al. (2013), used functionalized graphene sheets (FGS) loaded NaAlg composite membranes for studying the dehydration of IPA. Due to high surface area and polar functional groups of FGS, the composite membrane has shown enhanced selectivity up to an order of one magnitude. Continuing on this initial success, the authors further experimented with FGS and chitosan composites (Dharupaneedi et al., 2014). These results were even better than their previous efforts for the dehydration of EtOH and IPA for which selectivity values were 1093 and 7781, respectively. Further, to enhance the results, authors enhanced functional groups on graphene by hydrogen peroxide treatment and blending with chitosan-poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) PVP composites (Suhas et al., 2015). This has favourably increased the interfacial compatibility between graphene and polymers giving an improved selectivity. Fig. 3 shows the influence of graphene on membrane performance. Recently, Wu et al. (2019), also used GO-incorporated polyelectrolyte complex membranes for PV dehydration of ethylene glycol. They could achieve a 99.25% water selectivity, proving the efficiency of such membranes in dehydration of diol or similar systems. Graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs) are the carbon-based nanomaterials resembling the structure of GO, but having a smaller size of <100 nm, were incorporated into PVA dense selective layer supported onto polysulfone substrate to prepare a composite PV membrane for IPA dehydration (Lecaros et al., 2019). The torturous pathway and presence of polar functional groups favored the permeation of water molecules. Interestingly, the membranes showed higher selectivity towards IPA-water mixture than n-propanol-water mixture. 3.3.9 Miscellaneous type filler materials Metal-organic frameworks (MOF's) with high porosity, tunable chemical and structural formulations as fillers and controllable affinity and adsorption capacity with polymers are the promising materials for developing novel PV membranes. UiO-66 type is one such a filler having a remarkable chemical, thermal and mechanical stability to the membranes formed (Cavka et al., 2008). Xu et al. (2018a), used nano-sized, three different functional UiO-66 fillers (UiO-66-NH2, UiO-66, and UiO-66-F4) for 6FDA-HB/DABA polyimide membranes for three different alcohol dehydration studies viz., methanol/water, EtOH/water, and IPA/water. Among the three fillers, UiO-66-NH2 gave superior performance for IPA/water dehydration. UiO-66-NH2 improved the overall flux of polyimide membrane due to high porosity and hydrophilic functional groups. Also, membranes were stable by continuously testing in cyclic PV experiments for 200 h. Silicotungstic acid modified with melamine (M-STA) particles were embedded in PVA/poly(vinyl amine) membranes to obtain a membrane rich in NH2 functional groups (Chaudhari et al., 2018). MMM with 8% loading of M-STA gave better performance with a flux of 0.36 kg/m2h and separation factor of 485.6 for 20 wt% water–IPA feed mixture at 60 °C. Thermally cyclo-dehydrated poly(imide-oxadiazole) (PIO) membranes where linear hydrazide groups were converted to rigid aromatic oxadiazole rings were used for IPA dehydration (Xu and Wang, 2018). Thermal cyclodehydration (TC) showed a more significant impact on the PV performance and membrane containing TC at 300 °C was found to be optimum that showed extended durability of 180 h. The 2D nano-porous COFTpHZ and PESU composites were fabricated in which COF nano-sheets migrate from membrane bulk to membrane surface forming a gradient distribution, which can be monitored by adjusting the concentration of COF (Yang et al., 2018). A composite with the highest COF contents of 50.90 vol% had greater hydrophilicity, and the optimized membrane gave a permeation flux of 2.48 kg m−2 h−1 and a high separation factor of 1430 for EtOH/water mixture. In order to overcome the difficulty in compatibility of MOFs and polymer matrix in membranes, Zhang et al. (2017), prepared dopamine-coated hydrophilic sulfonic acid group (SO3H-MIL-101-Cr) MOF and PVA membrane. Hydrogen bond formation between amine groups of PDA and hydroxyl groups of PVA resulted in self-polymerization and enhanced the compatibility between PVA and MOF. This has resulted in the highest flux of 7.05 × 10−5 g m−1 h−1 kPa−1and separation factor of 2864 for the ethanol-water system (water content: 10 wt%). The membrane dehydration in the acidic mixture is a challenging task owing to uncontrolled membrane swelling. To overcome this difficulty, Tang et al. (2019), used polyionic liquid (viz., poly[1-cyanomethyl-3-vinylimidazolium bromide]) and incorporated into sodium carboxymethyl cellulose to develop composite membranes for the dehydration of IPA in acidic medium. Compared to the pristine sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, the ionic liquid incorporated membranes showed consistent performance and showed acid resistant nature. However, regardless of a large number of publications on MMMs for dehydration of alcohols, it is perceptible that no commercial MMMs are available."
11,Miscellaneous type membranes,"3.4 Miscellaneous type membranes Polyethersulfone (PESU), polyphenylsulfone (PPSU), polytrimethylphenylethersulfone (T-PESU) and hydrophilic PESU-co-Pluronic (H-PESU) membranes were developed for EtOH and methanol dehydration (Xu et al., 2018b). A combination of rigid hydrophobic PESU and flexible hydrophilic pluronic moieties gave the best performance in dehydrating EtOH with the highest water permeability of 0.322 mg m−1 h−1 kPa−1 and selectivity of 685. Pluronic moiety forms water transport channels, while PESU moiety prevents uncontrolled swelling of membranes. The authors were able to concentrate alcohol permeate up to 86.8%. Very interestingly, a new microbial exopolysaccharide membrane was obtained from low cost and abundant carbon source (glycerol by-product of the biodiesel industry) (Meireles et al., 2013). The authors prepared two types of membranes by direct fermentation of broth and cross-linking by trichloroacetic acid, resulting in a homogeneous membrane, while the other is a composite membrane with a thin film cross-linked trichloroacetic acid supported onto PES as shown in Fig. 4 . Among the two types, PES-supported membrane was found to be potential for EtOH dehydration, since it gave a selectivity of 3000 at 5.0 wt% water concentration. The GO membranes have already shown their remarkable performance in water treatment since they can permeate only the water molecules, but block the permeation of ions (Sun et al., 2012), gases (Shen et al., 2016), alcohols (Nair et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2015). With this standpoint, Damasceno Borges et al. (2018), developed multi-layered GO membranes for alcohol dehydration. They also reported on the use of molecular dynamics and grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations to probe dehydration of EtOH and methanol via GO-based membranes consisting of multiple layered graphene-based films with different interlayer distance values and number of oxygen-containing functional groups. The authors concluded that dehydration properties of these membranes were not only dependent on the enthalpic mechanism, but also on entropic mechanisms governed by the geometric and size factors. Besides, inside the GO 2D-channels, the formation of H-bonding due to water molecular arrangement allows for fast water permeation giving effective dehydration. However, with the increase of oxygen-containing functional groups in the membrane, the separation factor also increased. Ammonia-functionalized GO/polyimide membranes were developed for IPA dehydration (Salehian and Chung, 2017a). The membrane gave 0.198 mg m−1 h−1 kPa−1 and a water/IPA molar selectivity of 6726, which was 35-times higher than that of the pristine co-polyimide membrane without sacrificing water permeability. The authors also coated amine-functionalized GO onto P84 hollow fiber that gave a flux of 1914 g m−2 h−1 and a water purity of 99.1% for the same IPA/water mixtures (Salehian and Chung, 2017b). Aldehyde functionalized GO membrane sheets with adjustable microstructural properties were prepared and tested for dehydration of EtOH, IPA, and n-butanol at various temperatures (Hua et al., 2017). The humic acid, a biopolymer, extracted from organic compost and GO membranes were prepared (Boffa et al., 2017) that were found to exhibit a high degree of membrane structure disorder, which benefited to give increased permeation rate. A 30% biopolymer loaded membrane showed water/EtOH selectivity of 4 and water permeance of 33% higher than the pristine GO membrane. Ultrathin membranes were prepared by LBL deposition of polyethyleneimine and tannic acid, a bio-based polyphenol onto hydrolized PAN. For 90 wt% aqueous EtOH solution, a separation factor of 1012 and a permeation flux of 1343 g/m2 h was obtained, while the thicknesses were found to be 118–220 nm (Liu et al., 2017b). Cheng et al. (2018c), developed a polyamide (PA) thin film nanocomposite membranes (TFNC) via interfacial polymerization (IP) containing ethylenediamine modified graphene oxide (eGO) interlayer on electro-spun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofiber substrate and a thin PA layer. The optimized PA/eGO/PAN TFNC membrane showed excellent dehydration of 90 wt% aqueous IPA solution with an extraordinary separation factor of 1866 and a high permeate flux of 4150 g/m2 h at 70 °C. Gelatin and GO were alternatively deposited onto the hydrolyzed PAN by LBL technique through electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bond, and hydrophobic interaction (Zhao et al., 2015). The nanopores of the hydrolyzed PAN were covered by GO reducing the required deposition cycles for the desired permselectivity, but the deposition of gelatine helped to improve the thermal stability of hybrid membrane that gave 98.7 wt% of pure permeate. Wang et al. (2012), used PAA/PEI multilayers by layer-by-layer technique assembled onto the inner surface of ceramic hollow fiber porous substrate, which was pre-treated by a amino silane coupling agents. The surface hydroxyl groups of ceramic membrane readily reacted with the silane groups of coupling agents forming SiO-ceramic bonds through a condensation reaction. Thus, multilayers of PAA/PEI were developed and heat-treated to achieve appropriate cross-linking by the formation of amides and carboxylate-ammonium complexes. After several permutations and combinations, five layers of PAA/PEI pair onto ceramic membrane surface was found to be more efficient at 75 °C. The authors also developed a dynamic negative pressure LBL assembly of PAA/PEI onto hydrolyzed PAN hollow fiber membranes (Zhang et al., 2008) to achieve separation factor value of 245 and 1338, while the permeate fluxes were 290 and 120 g/(m2 h), respectively for 95 wt% EtOH/water system. However, the reason for the difference in the efficiency in dehydration of alcohol was due to variation in crosslinking temperature. Shi et al. (2015), demonstrated LBL assembly by using the Nexar™ polymer, a sulfonated penta-block copolymer and PEI. With just one bilayer, a separation factor of 127 and a flux of 1160 g/m2 h were achieved at 50 °C for EtOH dehydration. Another work attempted using the PAA/PEI assembly layered onto PESU ultrafiltration support (Zhang et al., 2006). A minimum of four bilayers developed to obtain a relatively high separation factor for EtOH/water mixture, reproducibility of these membranes was questionable. Hyper-branched PEI pre-treatment and aldehyde modification were applied to various polymeric membranes such as Torlon®, Ultem®, and PES hollow fibers (Hua and Chung, 2015). Hyperbranched PEI pre-treatment mitigates the surface defects and augments membrane hydrophilicity to improve water transport, whereas modification with aldehydes has tightened the polymeric chains to enhance the selectivity. For higher selectivity, it is imperative to suppress the macro-voids formation during the phase inversion process. Sukitpaneenit and Chung (2014), suggested a schematic representation (Fig. 5 ) to use dual layer spinneret to control the phase inversion processes for PES hollow fibers formation with required morphologies. Polydopamine-coated and silicone rubber-coated TFC membranes prepared by this method yielded water separation factors of up to 51 and 60, with substantial high fluxes of 6.6 and 7.5 kg m−2 h−1, respectively. By this method, improved efficiency was achieved. Pei-Yao et al. (Zheng et al., 2018a), prepared polyelectrolyte and four different surfactant complex membranes for EtOH recovery. A combination of dihexadecyl-dimethyl-ammonium bromide (DHDAB) and PAA membrane gave the better performance. The crystallinity of membranes showed an adverse effect on both permeability and EtOH selectivity because of the tight packing new crystallinity region which allowed for lesser diffusion. Amorphous PAA-cetyl-trimethyl-ammonium bromide (CTAB) gave the flux and permeates concentration of 2.33 kg⋅m−2⋅h−1 and 18.71 wt%, while those for crystalline PAA-DHDA were 2.09 kg⋅m−2⋅h−1 and 5.5 wt%, respectively. Using fluoroalkyl silane (FAS) as the cross-linking agent, the fluorinated molecular monolayer was developed on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane, while polysulfone was used as the support (Zheng et al., 2018b). FAS ethoxy to PDMS hydroxyl equivalents ratio of 35 gave a flux value of 843 g−2 h−1 at 60 °C for 1 wt% n-butanol/water mixture. Polyamide/PAN hollow fiber composites were used for the IPA/water mixture dehydration (Tsai et al., 2018). SiO2 was added to the polymer solution to increase the hydrophilicity, and the membrane was able to show 419 g/m2h of permeation flux and 96.6 wt% of water content in a permeate of 90 wt% aqueous IPA solution at 25 °C. Crosslinked polybenzoxazine membrane having micropore size was examined for IPA dehydration (Liao et al., 2017). The micropore distribution varied from single to bimodal pattern in wet swollen condition. These changes demonstrated in-situ self-promoted characteristics of PV and improved the membrane performance in terms of permeation flux. The 100% water permeation with 330 g h−1m−2 flux for 70 wt% IPA aqueous solution. Vinyl sulfonic acid (VSA) was used as a monomer and N, N′-methylene bisacrylamide (MBAA) as the cross-linker to prepare a thin-film hydrogel using UV photo-initiation method onto the PES UF support (Liu and Bernstein, 2017). A grafted membrane giving the highest IEC gave 7.5 kg m−2 h−1 flux and a separation factor of 313, the stability of the membrane was not excellent. A polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM) is another class of materials generally used for organic dehydration (Gao et al., 2017). Asymmetric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) supported PIM-1/PVDF TFC membranes were prepared with a thickness of 1.0–2.9 μm. Phosphoric acid was added during the preparation of the PVDF doped solution to control the pore size and porosity. A 5 wt% mixture of butanol and water gave 9 kg m−2 h−1 of flux and 18.5 of separation factor at 65 °C. Cellulose acetate and polyamide cross-linked PDMS membranes were fabricated by a pre-wetting technique for PV dehydration of EtOH (Rezakazemi et al., 2015). Effects of the support layer and permselective thickness revealed that PDMS/polyamide membranes showed an overall better performance than the PDMS/cellulose acetate membranes. Tong et al. (2019), prepared a series of sphere-like homogeneous polyelectrolyte complex membranes by using sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride). PV experiments for EtOH dehydration, using these membranes revealed a satisfactory performance and desired anti-trade-off phenomenon of up to 99.35 wt% water selective permeate to 10 wt% water in feed under 70 °C."
12,Conclusions and future outlook,"PV technique has gained much wider popularity over the past decades, especially for dehydrating alcohols, leading to both product recovery and wastewater treatment. The morphological characteristics of the membranes are the most important aspects that make the process more profitable in terms of energy requirements and environmental pollution. As the membranes display many salient characteristics like independent of vapor/liquid equilibrium, easy to fabricate, low cost, environmentally benign, etc., are all the key parameters making the process more acceptable in industrial sectors. Incorporating suitable fillers into the membrane matrix have been fully explored and more research efforts are still underway in various laboratories around the world. However, polymer crystallinity, thermal stability, and dehydration capabilities are the most important factors for the future success of PV process in alcohol dehydration studies. Considering all the above factors, PV can be regarded as the best alternative technique where conventional distillation is more of a challenging process, costly and more energy conserving. Moreover, PV can be used progressively to improve the membrane performance for either high-level purification of the feeds or even separating the reaction mixtures such as in esterification reactions that are not covered in this review. Since PV is a barrier-based process, these separations can be combined with the reaction step, resulting in considerable improvements in reaction efficiencies, product yields and offer economic process. In this regard, tremendous scope exists for the separation of alcoholic products or even byproducts. Scientists are focusing on developing novel and better membranes with higher fluxes, better selectivity and broader chemical/thermal resistances, which will expand this area for further applications. We strongly recommend future researchers to work on enhancing the surface area and density of polar functional groups on fillers before mixing with the polymer. This approach would enhance interfacial compatibility between filler and polymer, thereby enhancing the membrane performance."
