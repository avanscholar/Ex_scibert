0,Introduction,"Photocatalytic water splitting for H2 evolution based on semiconductor technology is considered to be one of the most efficient approaches for overcoming current global energy and environmental challenges [1–5]. Among reported semiconductors, two-dimensional (2D) g-C3N4 (CN), with high chemical stability, nontoxicity and a small bandgap, demonstrates photocatalytic H2 generation activity, under visible-light irradiation, attracting significant attention. However, the H2 evolution efficiency of pristine CN is usually limited by fast charge recombination [6–10]. To solve this problem, coupling cocatalysts over CN and employing hole scavengers during H2 production test have been evidenced to be an efficient tactic for providing extra active sites and enhancing the charge separation for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [11,12]. However, triethanolamine (TEOA) are usually utilized as sacrificial agents to consume holes, wasting the oxidation capacity of photo-holes. If employing alcohols as hole scavengers during H2 production test, photo-holes can oxidize alcohols into useful aldehydes products in industrial scales [13]. In such case, photogenerated electrons and holes can be effectively utilized without engendering by-product. For example, Chen et al. have coupled Au nanoparticles as cocatalyst over the ZnIn2S4, and the Au/ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst illustrated high oxidation activity of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde (1762 μmol g−1 h−1) and high H2 production (1633 μmol g−1 h−1) [14]. Accordingly, loading suitable cocatalyst to construct novel bifunctional photocatalysts is an opportunity to achieve the simultaneous H2 generation and selective oxidation of value-added organic chemicals [15]. Platinum (Pt) co-catalyst is the most common choice owning to its low overpotential and high stability [16]. Nevertheless, the large-scale appliance of Pt is impaired by short supply and high price [17]. Hence, there is an urgent need to exploit cheap but efficient alternative cocatalysts. Recently, a 2D transition-metal-dichalcogenide (molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)) with stacked S–Mo–S layers has been found to be a serviceable cocatalyst for the photocatalytic HER [18,19]. As is known that MoS2 possesses two typical crystal structures: a semiconductor 2H-phase and a metallic 1T-phase; 1T-MoS2 manifests electrical conductivity that is 107 times higher than that of 2H–MoS2, indicating that 1T-MoS2 may be more suitable as a cocatalyst in the HER [20–22]. Recently, several strategies have been proposed for preparing 1T-MoS2 derived from 2H–MoS2, including metal atom doping [23], light irradiation [24], and nanocrystallization [25]. In particular, metal atom doping can provide electron donation to modulate the electronic structure and form octahedral coordination in 1T-MoS2, thus further enhancing the electrical conductivity and improving the HER performance [26]. For instance, Yang et al. fabricated Co-doped MoS2 with an overpotential of 10 mA cm−2, indicating that the Co-doped MoS2 was an efficient electrocatalyst for H2 production [27]. Attanayake et al. proved that Co- and Ni-doped MoS2 presented a low onset potential of −75 mV and overpotential of −145 mV, which were comparable to those of Pt [28]. Therefore, metal atom doping in MoS2 can simultaneously enhance the electrical conductivity and regulate the active sites; it also seems to be a useful method for enhancing the cocatalytic effect of MoS2 in the photocatalytic HER. In this study, 2D Co-doped MoS2 nanosheets with high electrical conductivity were coupled in-situ over the 2D CN nanosheets, to prepare 2D/2D Co-doped MoS2/CN nano-junctions via a hydrothermal method. The photogenerated electrons of the CN could transfer along the fast channel of the chemical linkage (N–Mo–S–Co) to the Co-doped MoS2 cocatalyst, thus accelerating the charge separation. As expected, the optimal Co-doped MoS2/CN nano-junction can use photogenerated electrons and holes at the same time to realize H2 production (2.96 mmol g−1 h−1) and selective oxidations of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde (1.45 mmol g−1 h−1). This study provides a design pathway for ameliorating the cocatalytic effect of MoS2 to further enhance the HER performance and eliminate the waste of sacrificial agents."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of MoS2/CN,"2.1 Synthesis of MoS2/CN CN nanosheets were fabricated via a thermal polycondensation method [29]. Initially, 200 mg of CN were added to dimethylformamide (DMF) solution; subsequently, different amounts of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate [(NH4)2MoS4] (3, 5, 10, 15 mg) were added and sonicated for 8 h. Then, the whole solution was diverted to a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 12 h. The resulted samples were centrifuged, washed with ethanol, and dried at 60 °C. The corresponding samples with (NH4)2MoS4 contents of 3, 5, 10, 15 mg were named CM-3, CM-5, CM-10, and CM-15, respectively."
3,Synthesis of Co-doped MoS2/CN,"2.2 Synthesis of Co-doped MoS2/CN A series of Co-doped MoS2/CN samples were prepared using the same procedure described in section 2.1, as illustrated in Fig. 1 , except that the amounts of CN and (NH4)2MoS4 were fixed at 200 and 10 mg, respectively. The mixed solution was then combined with different amounts of Co(NO)3·6H2O (0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25 and 1.5 mg). The obtained Co-doped MoS2/CN with different Co-doping content were denoted as CM-Co-0.5, CM-Co-0.75, CM-Co-1, CM-Co-1.25 and CM-Co-1.75."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The composition and structure were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker-AXS with Cu Kα radiation), Raman measurement (DXR spectrometer), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS-Ultra DLD electron spectrometer), Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Thermo Fisher iCAP PRO), respectively. The morphology and UV–visible spectra were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7001F), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100), and UV–visible spectrophotometer (UV2550, Shimadzu, Japan), respectively. The electrochemical behavior was characterized by electrochemical workstation (Chenhua Instruments, CHI660D). Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and work function were tested by a fluorescence spectrophotometer (JASCO FP-6500), electron spin resonance spectrometer (ER200-SRC, A300-10/12) and a SKP5050 K probe system with single-point measurement, respectively."
5,Photocatalytic activity measurement,"2.4 Photocatalytic activity measurement The photocatalytic H2 evolution activity was carried out on an online gas chromatography system (Labsolar-6A, Perfectlight, Fig. S1) with a circulating condensate system (10 °C). 20 mg of samples were separated in the triethanolamine (TEOA) aqueous solution (10 vol%, 80 mL), and the air was pumped out to keep the reactor (Fig. S1) in a vacuum environment. The device was irradiated using an 80 W LED lamp (λ = 420 nm, Silver Bead Technology). The H2-evolution was checked by a gas chromatograph (GC-2014, Shimadzu Co, Japan). For the test of simultaneous H2 evolution and benzyl alcohol oxidation, the test process was similar as stated above, except that 8 ml benzyl alcohol was used to replace the TEOA. The benzaldehyde production was checked by a gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (A91 plus, Panna (Changzhou) Instruments Co., Ltd). For the test of benzyl alcohol oxidation, 10 mg of catalyst was dispersed in the solution containing 1.8 ml of acetonitrile and 200 μl of benzyl alcohol, and then illumined by the 80 W LED lamp for 5 h. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of HER was checked via the equation: A Q E ( % ) = 2 × a m o u n t o f H 2 m o l e c u l e s e v o l v e d i n u n i t t i m e n u m b e r o f i n c i d e n t p h o t o n s i n u n i t t i m e × 100 %"
6,Results and discussion,"The XRD patterns of the CN and the typical Co-doped MoS2/CN nano-junction (CM-Co-1 sample) are illustrated in Fig. 2 a. The XRD pattern of the CM-Co-1 sample is same as that of the CN. The (002) peak at 27.7° corresponds to the interlayer stacking while the (100) peak at 13.1° is attributed to the 2D structure [30]. However, no diffraction peak belonging to the Co-doped MoS2 is observed for the CM-Co-1 sample, which may be because of the small amount of Co-doped MoS2 in the Co-doped MoS2/CN. Loading of the Co-doped MoS2 over CN can effectively enhance the light adsorption ability, which can be clearly seen in the UV–vis spectra (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, with the increase of Co-doping content, the color of the sample would gradually become darker and the absorption of the sample increases gradually in visible light range (Fig. S2). Pure CN demonstrates an evident light adsorption edge at 420 nm. Meanwhile, the Co-doped MoS2/CN composites demonstrate red-shifted light adsorption edges and enhanced visible-light adsorption from 400 to 800 nm, indicating that coupling Co-doped MoS2 nanosheets over the CN nanosheets can enhance the light-responsiveness and thus, increase the HER efficiency [31]. To further confirm the existence of Co-doped MoS2 in the Co-doped MoS2/CN composite, XPS measurement was performed over the typical CM-Co-1 sample. It is obviously that the signals belonging to elements of C, N, S, Mo and Co are observed in the full profile of the CM-Co-1 (Fig. 3 a). The C 1s spectrum of the CM-Co-1 sample (Fig. 3b) illustrates three typical feature peaks at 284.8 eV (C–C), 286.1 eV (C–N–C) and 288.4 eV (C-(N)3), respectively [32]. For the N 1s spectrum (Fig. 3c), three peaks can be found at 395.5, 399.2, 400.9 eV, the first peak is ascribed to the formation Mo–N bond [33], and the second and third peaks located in 399.2 eV and 400.9 eV can be ascribed to C–N–C and C–NH3 of the CN, respectively. In is noted that a Mo–N bond is observed in the N 1s spectrum of the CM-Co-1 sample, indicating that a chemical coupling between Mo and N is formed in the CM-Co-1 sample. For the S 2p (Fig. 3d), the peaks appear at the binging energy of 163.2 and 161.7 eV belong to S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2, respectively. For Mo 3d spectrum (Fig. 3e), two peaks appear at the binding energy of 232.2 and 228.85 eV are ascribed to Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2 [34]. It is noted that Co 2p is also observed in the survey profile of the CM-Co-1 (Fig. 3f). The Co 2p peak of the CM-Co-1 can be disintegrated into four peaks [35], two peaks located at 779.1 eV (Co 2p3/2) and 794.1 eV (Co 2p1/2), respectively, and the Co 2p double peaks at 781.5 and 796.5 eV evidence the successful Co-doping in the MoS2 and formation of the Co–S bond in the CM-Co-1 sample. Based on the above analysis, a chemical linkage of N–Mo–S–Co is formed, which can act as electron transfer channel between the Co-doped MoS2 and CN to accelerate charge separation. The morphology of the CN, Co-doped MoS2, CM-Co-1 samples was investigated by SEM and TEM; both the CN and Co-doped MoS2 samples demonstrated 2D nanosheet morphology, with curly stripes observed for the Co-doped MoS2 (Fig. 4 a and b). The HRTEM image illustrates a lattice fringe of the Co-doped MoS2 nanosheets at 0.68 nm, corresponding to the (002) plane of MoS2 [36]. A few layers are observed around the edge of the Co-doped MoS2, which favors the exposure of more active edges (Fig. 4c). TEM (Fig. 4d) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) pictures (Fig. 4e) of the CM-Co-1 sample authenticates that there is an intimate interface between the Co-doped MoS2 and CN. The SEM image of the CM-Co-1 sample shows Co-doped MoS2 nanosheets grow over the CN nanosheets (Fig. 4f). An obvious EPR signal observed for the CM-Co-1 sample confirms the abundant vacancy defects in the CM-Co-1 sample (Fig. S3) [37]. The corresponding energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis (Fig. 4g) presents a homogenous distribution of C and N elements as well as the coexistence of Mo, S, and Co elements in CM-Co-1, evidencing successful coupling of 2D Co-doped MoS2 over 2D CN. First, pristine MoS2 was utilized as a cocatalyst to promote the H2 generation of CN; the results are displayed in Fig. 5 a and b. It can be found that, with an increasing content of the MoS2 cocatalyst, the MoS2/CN composites demonstrate first enhanced H2 generation, and then, decreased H2 generation. The CM-10 sample demonstrates the highest H2 production of 1.49 mmol g−1 h−1. For comparison, the Co-doped MoS2 was also employed as a cocatalyst to elevate the H2 generation of CN. As expected, the addition of Co-doped MoS2 as cocatalyst also enhances the H2 generation of CN (Fig. 5c and d), and the CM-Co-1 sample demonstrates the highest H2 generation (3.61 mmol g−1 h−1). Excessive Co-doping in MoS2 would create more defects it acts a recombination center, reducing the efficiency of hydrogen production. As shown in Fig. 5e, the Co-doped MoS2 demonstrates a better cocatalytic effect than pure MoS2; the H2 generation of the CM-Co-1 sample (3.61 mmol g−1 h−1) with the Co-doped MoS2 cocatalyst is approximately 2.43 and 68 times higher than that of CM-10 with MoS2 cocatalyst (1.49 mmol g−1 h−1) and pure CN (0.053 mmol g−1 h−1), respectively. This may be because Co-doping in MoS2 increases the edge site activity of MoS2 and the chemical linkage (Co–S–Mo) acting as electron transfer channel accelerates charge transfer, which are partly for the improvement in performance. For comparison, a physically mixed sample (referred to as SCM-Co-1) of the Co-doped MoS2 and CN was prepared, and its H2 generation was tested. The CM-Co-1 sample also presented approximately 6.51 times higher activity than the mixed sample, indicating that the tight interface structure of the CM-Co-1 sample, formed during the in-situ hydrothermal synthesis, is also important for enhancing the HER performance. H2 production using the CM-Co-1 was higher than that of previously-reported non-metallic cocatalyst-modified CN photocatalysts (Table S1), indicating the superiority of the Co-doped MoS2 cocatalyst. To explore the effect of different hole sacrificial agents on the H2 generation activity of the CM-Co-1 sample, TEOA, methanol, and lactic acid were used in photocatalytic HER test; the results of which are shown in Fig. 5f. Consequently, it can be concluded that TEOA exhibits the best effect as a sacrificial agent in the HER, and the CM-Co-1 sample presents higher HER performance in an alkaline environment. Fig. 5g shows the stability of the CM-Co-1 sample. A decrease in H2 generation is observed in the first three cycles, after adding TEOA again, the H2 generation reaches the original level. The slight drop in the third cycle is attributed to digestion of the sacrificial agent. After photocatalytic reaction, CM-Co-1 sample was tested by XRD, SEM, TEM, HRTEM and XPS. The XRD pattern (Fig. 5h) and XPS spectra (Fig. S4) of the CM-Co-1 sample after the HER are almost the same as that of the original sample, corroborating the stability of the CM-Co-1 sample. The SEM, TEM and HRTEM of the collected CM-Co-1 sample is also similar to the original sample (Fig. S5), demonstrating 2D/2D structure and the lattice fringe of 0.68 nm belonging to the Co-doped MoS2. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of the CM-Co-1 sample achieves 9.76% at λ = 420 nm (Fig. 5i). In order to improve the solar conversion efficiency, synchronous appliance of photogenerated electrons and holes is the same system is promising. Herein, benzyl alcohol was employed to replace the TEOA to evaluate the coupling activity of H2 generation and selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde. It can be found that photo-holes and photo-electrons generated by the CM-Co-1 sample can selectively oxidize benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and reduce water to H2 at the same time (Fig. 6 a and b). The selectivity to benzaldehyde reaches 99%. In this situation, the H2 generation and benzaldehyde production rates of the CM-Co-1 sample can reach 0.31 and 0.48 mmol g−1 h−1, which is around 310 and 3.7 times higher compared to CN. The H2 generation and benzaldehyde production rates of the CM-Co-1 are higher than those of the MoS2/CN sample and mechanical mixed sample of Co-doped MoS2 and CN (SCM-Co-1 sample), indicating that the superiority of the Co-doped MoS2 as cocatalyst for enhancing the synchronous utilization efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes. The photocatalytic performance of oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol (yield and selectivity) at 420, 500, 550, and 720 nm over the optimized sample was tested. It is illustrated that the benzaldehyde production rate and selectivity of the CM-Co-1 sample can reach 1.14 mmol g−1 h−1 and 99% at λ = 420 nm. When the light source is extended to 550 nm, the yield is greatly reduced to 4 μmol g−1 h−1, but the selectivity is still 99%. The photocatalytic stability of benzyl alcohol oxidation over the CM-Co-1 sample was tested (Fig. S7). With the extension of illumination time, the amount of benzaldehyde increases and the selectivity remains at 99%. After 15 h, the CM-Co-1 sample was collected. The XRD pattern of the recovered CM-Co-1 sample is the same as that of the fresh sample, further indicating the stability of the CM-Co-1. To determine why the Co-doped MoS2 presented a superior cocatalytic effect than pure MoS2, the structure of the Co-doped MoS2 and pure MoS2 was investigated via XRD and Raman measurements. The XRD spectra of both the Co-doped MoS2 and pure MoS2 samples match well with that reported for MoS2 (JCPDS 37–1492) (Fig. 7 a) [38]. The Co-doping is confirmed by the ICP characterization, the Co-doping content in the Co-doped MoS2 is 3.8 wt%. As for the Raman spectra (Fig. 7b), three characteristic 2H-phase peaks at 281 (E2g), 371 (E1 2g) and 398 (A1g) are found for the as-prepared MoS2 [39]. Here, the E2g and E1 2g peaks are ascribed to the Mo–S vibration at the terrace terminations of 2H–MoS2, while the A1g peak is geared to the Mo–S vibration at the edge sites of 2H–MoS2 [40]. Other than this, 1T-phase signals (145 (J1), 231 (J2), and 334 cm−1 (J3)) are also observed for MoS2 [41], indicating the mixed nature of the 1T and 2H phases. The Raman spectrum of the Co-doped MoS2 is similar to that of MoS2, except that the A1g vibration mode belonging to the 2H phase disappears in the Co-doped MoS2. This indicates that no 2H phase exists on the edge site of the Co-doped MoS2. Overall, the Co-doped MoS2 still contains a mixture of the 1T and 2H phases, and its edge sites are occupied by active sites of the 1T phase, which is beneficial for improving the HER activity. The survey XPS spectrum of the Co-doped MoS2 is similar to that of MoS2 (Fig. 8 a). The existence of the Co-doping is also confirmed by the high resolution XPS spectrum of Co 2p peaks (Fig. 8b), in which the peaks around 779.1 and 794.1 eV is attributed to the Co–S bond and other two peaks at 781.5 and 796.5 eV, belonging to Co2+ [35]. The atomic content of Co element in the Co-doped MoS2 is nearly 1.55%. In the S 2p spectrum of MoS2, peaks for S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 are surveyed at 162.9 and 161.5 eV. Furthermore, the 1T-phase content of MoS2 and Co-doped MoS2 is calculated by the XPS spectra of S 2p, the content of the 1T phase would increase from 72.39% to 77.67% after Co-doping (Table S2), indicating that Co-doping promotes the 1T-phase content in the Co-doped MoS2 [42]. The characteristic 1T phase peaks of Mo 3d3/2 (232.08 eV) and Mo 3d5/2 (228.95 eV), as well as two small peaks (233.27 and 230.17 eV) belonging to 2H phase, are inspected in the Mo 3d spectrum of MoS2 (Fig. 8d) [34]. The last two peaks belonging to Mo6+ of MoO3 and S 2s can be found at 235.83 and 226.28 eV, respectively. Notably, the peaks of Mo 3d5/2 and S 2p3/2 for the Co-doped MoS2 shifted to a lower binding energy compared to those of pure MoS2, proving the formation of the Co–S bond in the Co-doped MoS2 (Fig. 8d). Linear sweep voltammetry curves and Nyquist plots were obtained to investigate the overpotential and interface resistance (Fig. 9 a and b), respectively. The Co-doped MoS2 demonstrates a lower overpotential and lower charge transfer resistance than MoS2, testifying that the Co-doped MoS2 is preferable for employed as a cocatalyst in the HER [43]. Furthermore, the first-principles theory (DFT) calculation was also used to investigate why the Co-doped MoS2 presented a better cocatalytic effect than pure MoS2. As displayed in Fig. 10 a and b, the continuous distribution of the electronic density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level is indicative of the metallic characteristics of MoS2 and Co-doped MoS2. Notably, the increased DOS of the Co-doped MoS2 compared to that of MoS2 indicates that Co-doped MoS2 has higher metallicity [44]. Moreover, work function (WF) of Co-doped MoS2 (001 plane) is determined to be 4.952 eV (Fig. 10c). According to our previous report, the WF of CN is 5.193 eV [45]. When the Co-doped MoS2 is contact with CN, an ohmic junction is formed. To verify the reliability of the theoretical calculation, the WFs of CN and Co-doped MoS2 were tested via Kelvin probe force measurements. The measured WF values of CN and Co-doped MoS2 samples are 4.74 and 4.67 eV, respectively. Accordingly, when the 2D Co-doped MoS2 is in contact with 2D CN, an 2D/2D ohmic-junction is formed ( Fig. 10d). Compared with the Schottky-junction, the electron transfer in the ohmic-junction does not need to overcome the Schottky-barrier; consequently, faster charger separation is realized in the Co-doped MoS2/CN nano-junction [46,47]. Furthermore, the H∗ adsorption energy (ΔG) behavior of MoS2 and the Co-doped MoS2 was investigated using DFT calculations. Usually, when the absolute value of ΔG is closer to 0, the HER is easier to realize [48,49]. As shown in Fig. 11 a and b, the ΔG values of MoS2 and the Co-doped MoS2 were measured to be 0.841 and 0.639 eV, respectively, evidencing the superior cocatalytic effect of Co-doped MoS2 for the HER. Furthermore, photoluminescence (PL), time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), transient photocurrent response (PC), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were adopted to investigate the charge separation behavior of the CN and CM-Co-1 samples. As manifested in Fig. 12 a, CN exhibits a high emission peak at 470 nm, owing to significant charge recombination [50]. The PL intensity of CM-Co-1 is dramatically quenched, indicating that the recombination of photogenerated carriers can be inhibited using Co-doped MoS2 cocatalyst. A faster decay of TRPL (0.087 ns) is observed for the CM-Co-1 sample compared to that of CN (0.16 ns), implying the existence of effective electron transfer channels from CN to Co-doped MoS2 (Fig. 12b) [51]. CM-Co-1 demonstrates a higher PC intensity and lower EIS radius than CN (Fig. 12c and 12d), indicating that loading the Co-doped MoS2 cocatalyst can accelerate the charge separation efficiency and decrease the charge transfer resistance, which is favorable for enhancing the photocatalytic activity [52–54]. To detect electron generation in the CN and CM-Co-1 samples, EPR using 2, 2, 6, 6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) as a radical scavenger was performed (Fig. 12e). Both samples demonstrate typical TEMPO-e- spectra with three significant characteristic peaks. Moreover, the signal intensity of CM-Co-1 is lower than that of CN under visible-light irradiation, indicating that more photogenerated electrons are transferred to the surface [55]. These results confirm that the introduction of Co-doped MoS2 as a cocatalyst of CN can improve the transfer of photogenerated carriers and significantly increase the charge separation efficiency. The band gap can be calculated using formula (αhυ)1/n = A (hυ - Eg); the result is illustrated in Fig. 12f [56]. The band gap of pure CN is 2.68 eV. By combining the results of Mott–Schottky plots (Fig. 12g) and formula Efb = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 × pH + E0 Ag/AgCl (pH = 6.9, and E0 Ag/AgCl = 0.197 eV), the flat potential is calculated to be −0.73 V. The conduction band (ECB) is computed at −1.03 V due to that the ECB is 0.3 eV less than flat-band potential. A schematic of the photocatalytic mechanism is manifested in Fig. 13 . The Co-doped MoS2 as a cocatalyst demonstrates highly metallic characteristics, and possesses extensive active sites, acting as an excellent photoelectron acceptor and active site for the HER. Owing to the intimate interface, the photo-excited electrons rapidly transfer from the CN nanosheets to the Co-doped MoS2 nanosheets as a cocatalyst along the chemical linkage (Co–S–Mo) in the Co-doped MoS2. The rapid transport of electrons causes the large number of holes to accumulate in the valence band (VB) of CN, which provided a stronger oxidation capacity for oxidizing benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. The benzyl alcohol molecules are adsorbed on the surface of the CM-Co-1 composite, resulting in the dehydrogenation process of hydroxyl oxygen group on the benzyl alcohol molecules. Then, the photogenerated holes on the VB of CN lead to subsequent α-hydride elimination of benzyl alcohol to give a deprotonated carbon radical. Followed by the hole oxidation of carbon radical to form the desired benzaldehyde, and this step is accompanied by the H2 generation [57,58]. In summary, the introduction of co-doped MoS2 on CN to form ohmic junctions exposes more active sites while accelerates the electron-hole separation, significantly improving the performance of H2 production and benzyl alcohol oxidation."
7,Conclusions,"To fabricate a novel 2D/2D Co-doped MoS2/CN nano-junction, 2D Co-doped MoS2 nanosheets with an edge-enriched 1T phase were employed as cocatalysts with 2D CN nanosheets. The Co-doped MoS2 possessed higher metallic characteristics, lower H∗ adsorption, and more active sites than pure MoS2 cocatalyst. Moreover, a 2D/2D ohmic-junction was formed between the Co-doped MoS2 nanosheets and CN nanosheets, inducing a chemical linkage (N–Mo–S–Co) as a rapid electron transport channel. As a result, faster transfer of photogenerated electrons was realized in the Co-doped MoS2/CN nano-junction, and the optimal Co-doped MoS2/CN nano-junction displayed the ability to selectively oxidize benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and reduce water to H2 by using photo-electrons and holes at the same time. The simultaneous H2 and benzaldehyde production rates can 0.31 and 0.48 mmol g−1 h−1 over the optimal Co-doped MoS2/CN nano-junction. Accordingly, this work demonstrates a novel direction for the rational development of bi-functional photocatalysts and Co-doped MoS2 is a promising non-metallic cocatalyst for improving the utilization of solar energy."
