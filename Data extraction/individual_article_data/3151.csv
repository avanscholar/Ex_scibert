0,Introduction,"Hydrogen energy is considered to be able to alleviate the ever-growing issue of environment and global energy crisis [1,2]. Electrochemical water splitting is an eco-friendly, sustainable and highly efficient way to produce clean hydrogen fuel [3,4]. So far, due to its negligible environment pollution, high energy conversion efficiency and wide application prospects, this energy conversion technology has attracted widely attention [5]. As we all know, we need to add superior catalyst in the process of water electrolysis to improve the reaction rate and reduce the overpotential [6]. At present, platinum is considered to be the most efficient (overpotential of −32 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and stable electrocatalysts for HER [7,8]. However, the widely application of platinum electrocatalyst is hindered by its high cost and scarcity [9,10]. Therefore, it is urgent to design cheap electrocatalysts with high stability and Pt like activity to replace Pt-based catalysts. Recently, many researches have been devoted to the development of transition metal based electrocatalysts (such as Ni [11–13], Fe [14–17], Co [18–20] and Mo [21–23]) with excellent catalytic activity. Among them, nickel is the most commonly used cathode material for hydrogen evolution in alkaline aqueous solution due to its low price and good corrosion resistance [24,25]. Moreover, the combination of Ni and Mo will bring higher electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance [26–29]. As we all know, most of the NiMo electrocatalysts can be divided into two types according to dimensions. One type is one-dimensional or two-dimensional structure of nickel molybdenum electrocatalysts [30,31]. Due to the limited area of these electrocatalysts, the active sites are insufficient and the electron transport is hindered, which seriously affects the hydrogen evolution efficiency. Moreover, most of one-dimensional or two-dimensional nickel molybdenum electrocatalysts need to add adhesion agent in the process of hydrogen evolution. And using of adhesion agent will not only seriously affect the hydrogen evolution performance of the electrode, but also seriously affect the stability of the electrode. The second type is NiMo electrocatalysts with 3D structure [32–34]. These electrocatalysts usually use carbon cloth (CC) as the substrate and obtain NiMo oxides by hydrothermal synthesis. Finally, NiMo electrocatalysts are obtained by high temperature reduction. The preparation method of this kind of electrocatalyst is complex and tedious, and needs extremely high temperature heating equipment. Therefore, it is necessary to design a three-dimensional NiMo electrocatalyst with simple preparation method and excellent hydrogen evolution performance. Silver is considered to be one of the most suitable elements for large-scale application because of its relatively low cost and non-toxic. And a three-dimensional conductive substrate with good conductivity and stability can be developed by combining silver nanowire and polyurethane foam [35]. Moreover, silver nanowires have strong corrosion resistance, and silver nanowires as conductive substrate can produce synergistic effect with electrocatalyst, which helps to improve the catalytic performance of the catalyst [36,37]. Herein, we combined polyurethane sponge (PU), silver, nickel and molybdenum together by electrodeposition, and successfully prepared 3D AgNWs@NiMo/PU electrocatalyst. It is found that 3D structure provides abundant-exposed active site attachment points. And 3D AgNWs/PU not only promoted the electron transport of 3D AgNWs@NiMo/PU electrocatalyst, but also promoted the activity significantly. The existence of 3D AgNWs/PU makes AgNWs@NiMo/PU electrode have excellent hydrophilic property, which can improve the permeability of AgNWs@NiMo/PU electrode in electrolyte solution and further promote hydrogen evolution. In addition, 3D AgNWs@NiMo/PU electrode does not need adhesive in the process of hydrogen evolution, which further improves the performance and stability of hydrogen evolution electrode. Explicitly, when the electrodeposition time of NiMo is 1200 s, 3D AgNWs@NiMo/PU electrocatalyst exhibits the most excellent HER performance in 1 M KOH aqueous solution, with a lowest overpotential (32 mV) at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a lowest Tafel slope of 72 mV dec−1 for HER. At the same time, the 3D AgNWs@NiMo/PU electrocatalyst also exhibits high durability after 10 h stability test in 1 M KOH solution."

2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals AgNWs were purchased from Suzhou Lengshi Nano Materials Technology Co., Ltd., which were dispersed in ethyl alcohol with a concentration of 5.8 mg/ml. Nickel sulfate hexahydrate (NiSO4·6H2O), citrate sodium (Na3C6H5O7·2H2O), tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane and dopamine hydrochloride were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd..

All chemicals were used without further purification. In addition, polyurethane sponge (PU) were purchased from Nanjing Yongsheng sponge Co., Ltd."
3,Pretreatment of polyurethane sponge (PU),"2.2 Pretreatment of polyurethane sponge (PU) The PU was pretreated according to the method in the previous literature.[35] In a nutshell, the first step is that the commercial PU was cut into a rectangle of 50 × 50 × 3 mm, then cleaned with ethanol and deionized water, and dried at 60 °C for 4 h. Finally, the dried PU was cut into a small pieces with a size of 10 mm × 10 mm × 3 mm. The second step is that dissolve tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (0.242 g) in 200 mL of distilled water and maintain pH at 8–9 with HCl. Then, 0.2 g dopamine hydrochloride was added and dissolved. All PU sheets have immersed in the solution for 12 h and then dried at 40 °C for 2 h."
4,Preparation of 3D AgNWs/PU,"2.3 Preparation of 3D AgNWs/PU The pretreatment of PU was immersed in AgNWs dispersion (AgNWs with concentration of 5.8 mg/mL) for 30 min, and then dried at 40 °C for 2 h. The dip-coating process was repeated until the surface of PU was fully coated with AgNWs."
5,Preparation of 3D AgNWs@NiMo/PU hydrogen evolution electrode,"2.4 Preparation of 3D AgNWs@NiMo/PU hydrogen evolution electrode Electrodeposition of NiMo alloy on 3D AgNWs/PU was conducted with a standard two-electrode electrochemical cell. Briefly, a graphite rod was used as counter electrode and the 3D AgNWs/PU as working electrode. And the electrolyte used in the cell was a mixed aqueous solution of NiSO4·6H2O (20 g/L), Na2MoO4·2H2O (12 g/L), Na3C6H5O7·2H2O (22 g/L) and maintain pH at 10 with NH3·H2O. Then the NiMo alloy was electrodeposited on the 3D AgNWs/PU electrode at a constant current density of −50 mA/cm2 at room temperature. Finally, it was cleaned with deionized water, and dried at 60 °C for 4 h. In this way, 3D AgNWs@NiMo/PU hydrogen evolution electrode was obtained. In order to optimize the electrodeposition time, NiMo alloy was electrodeposited on the 3D AgNWs/PU with various time of 600 s, 900 s, 1200 s and 1800 s at the same current density. The obtained AgNWs@NiMo/PU samples were denoted as AgNWs@NiMo/PU-600s, AgNWs@NiMo/PU-900s, AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1200s and AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1800s, respectively."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization The samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS, HITACHI S-4700), contactangletester (Germany Dataphysics OCA20), X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/Max 2500/PC), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS, Summerfly K-Alpha)."
7,Electrochemical measurements,"2.6 Electrochemical measurements All electrochemical measurements were performed on the CHI760E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co. Ltd.) at room temperature with a typical three-electrode system. AgNWs@NiMo/PU can be directly used as working electrode with the dimensions of 1.0 cm × 1.0 cm. Pt/C electrode (1 mg Platinum carbon powder and 50 µL Nafion were dispersed in 1 mL water/ethanol (3:1) solution, then drop on 3D polyurethane foam.) also can be directly used as working electrode. In addition, Hg/HgO was used as the reference electrode and graphite electrode was used as the counter electrode, and 1 M KOH (pH = 14) solution was used as the electrolyte. For better comparison, all the potentials referred herein has been calibrated and converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The conversion formula was E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. Hg/HgO) + 0.059 × pH + 0.0977 V. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) test was carried out from −0.8 V to −1.5 V (vs. Hg/HgO) with a scanning rate of 5 mV s−1, and all LSV curves have been corrected for iR compensation. The Tafel plots can be obtained from the overpotential (ƞ) and log current (log (j)) in the polarization curve. Moreover, the Tafel slope (b) can be obtained from fitting the linear part of the Tafel plots to the Tafel equation (ƞ = b log (j) + a). Cyclic voltammogram (CV) data were collected by varying scan rates (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 and 50 mV s−1) at overpotential window without occurring the faradaic reactions which is from 0.074 V to 0.174 V (vs. RHE); and double-layer capacitance (Cdl) obtained by calculating CV data. In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data were acquired with the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz, of which the amplitude is 10 mV."
8,Results and discussion,"As shown in Fig. 1 a, a simple electrodeposition process was used to prepare AgNWs@NiMo/PU electrodes with 3D structure. In simple terms, we first pretreated the polyurethane sponge (PU), and the optical photo was shown in Fig. S1a. Then the AgNWs adhered to the pre-treated PU by immersion to obtain the AgNWs/PU with 3D structure, and the optical photo was shown in Fig. S1b. The color of PU changed from gray brown to pure gray after soaking in silver nanowires. Finally, we have obtained the AgNWs@NiMo/PU electrode with 3D structure by electrodeposition, and the optical photo was shown in Fig. S1c. It can be seen that the color of the electrode is further deepened after electrodeposition. And the hydrogen evolution process over 3D AgNWs@NiMo/PU electrocatalyst is shown in Fig. 1b. Fig. 2 a-b shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the 3D AgNWs/PU. It can be observed that the PU surface is covered with a large number of crisscross silver nanowires, which is the premise of good conductivity of the substrate. The magnified SEM image of the pure AgNWs (Fig. 2c) is further shows that the surface of silver nanowires is smooth and the diameter is about 50 nm. In addition, the SEM images of AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1200s are shown in Fig. 2d-f. It can be seen from the figure that after electrodeposition the surface of AgNWs is covered with an array of materials. It also can be seen from the cross section (Fig. S2) that the AgNWs@NiMo nanowires is composed of nano arrays coated on the surface of AgNWs. Furthermore, with the increase of electrodeposition time the array of materials becomes more and more obvious, as shown in Fig. S3 in the Supporting Information. In order to find out the influence of the 3D AgNWs/PU on the electrode, we made contact angle test. As shown in Fig. 3 a-c, the contact angles of water with carbon cloth, conductive substrate and electrode are 147.6°, 70.4° and 29.8° respectively. This fully shows that the existence of 3D AgNWs/PU makes the electrode have better hydrophilicity. And the hydrophilic property can make the electrode have better permeability in the process of hydrogen evolution. First of all, to analyze this array of materials, the crystal structures of the samples was obtained by XRD (as shown in Fig. 3d). The diffraction patterns of 3D AgNWs/PU can be indexed to standard Ag metal (JCPDS 04-0783) [38]. And the peak of 2θ = 44.5°, 51.8°, and 76.3° are corresponded to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of Ni metal (JCPDS 04-0850) [39]. A strong peak appears at about 2θ = 44.5°, which can be attributed to the overlap of (200) plane of Ag and (111) face of Ni. And no metal phase of molybdenum was found in XRD pattern, indicating that the content of molybdenum is low or molybdenum is amorphous [40]. In addition, the corresponding energy dispersive spectra mappings were examined. Fig. 3e shows the skeleton of 3D AgNWs@NiMo/PU electrode and Fig. 3f-i is the corresponding EDX mappings, presenting the distributions of the existing elements (Ag, Ni, Mo, and O) in the 3D AgNWs@NiMo/PU electrode. Secondly, we further examined the compositions of NiMo array on the surface of AgNWs by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XPS of AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1200s and 3D AgNWs/PU are shown in Fig. S4a, confirming the existence of Mo, C, Ag, O and Ni elements in AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1200s, and the C element comes from the polyurethane substrate. Fig. 4 a-d shows the XPS peaks of Ag, Ni, Mo and O element of the AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1200s electrode, and this is consistent with the EDX mappings data. There are two main peaks in the XPS of Ag 3d (Fig. 4a), located at 367.8, and 373.8 eV respectively, which is consistent with the XPS of Ag 3d of the 3D AgNWs/PU (Fig. S4b). Hence the Ag atoms in AgNWs are at metallic state (Ag0) [41]. For the XPS of Ni 2p (Fig. 4b), the peak at 852.3 eV indicated the presence of metal nickel [39,42]. The two peaks at 856.3 eV and 873.9 eV, accompanied with two satellite peaks at 861.8 eV and 879.5 eV, were assigned to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 respectively, which were both Ni2+ valence states [43]. For the XPS of Mo 3d (Fig. 4c), the peak at 227.5 eV was assigned to the Mo0 3d5/2 [44]. And the peak at 230 eV and 235.4 eV are attributed to Mo4+ ions in the type of MoO2. In addition, the peaks at 232.5 eV and 235.7 eV in the AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1200 s indicated the existence of Mo6+ [45–47]. The XPS spectra of O 1 s is shown in Fig. 4d, there is a high energy band and two low-energy band at 531.4 eV, 530.1 eV and 533.2 eV, respectively. The high peak at around 531.4 eV is associated with hydroxyl groups. The lower peak at 530.1 eV represented the state of oxygen in metal–oxygen bonds (M-O). And the peak at 533.2 eV attribute to adsorbed molecular water [43,48]. Therefore, XPS results show that AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1200s electrode contains silver, nickel, molybdenum, nickel oxide and molybdenum oxide. In a word, the combined analysis of SEM, XRD, EDX mappings and XPS indicates the formation that the AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1200s electrode for hydrogen evolution is composed of 3D AgNWs/PU, Ni metal, Mo metal and NiMo oxides on the surface. Fig. 5 a presents the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of AgNWs@NiMo/PU-600s, AgNWs@NiMo/PU-900s, AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1200s, AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1800s, 3D AgNWs/PU, carbon cloth (CC), NiMo-1200s/CC, and Pt/C electrode in 1 M KOH. As shown in the figure, the hydrogen evolution effect of the AgNWs@NiMo/PU electrode is much better than the 3D AgNWs/PU. The results show that the main active sites of hydrogen evolution are NiMo alloy. Moreover, compared with NiMo-1200s/CC, the hydrogen evolution efficiency of the AgNWs@NiMo/PU electrode is also improved. All the results prove that the silver nanowires not only play a role in conducting electricity, but also promote the hydrogen evolution of NiMo. And electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Fig. 5e) also reflects lower resistance of AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1200s. Morover, due to the existence of 3D AgNWs/PU, there is no need to add adhesive in the process of hydrogen evolution, which promotes the performance of HER. And as shown in the Fig. 5b, to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the electrode of AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1200s exhibits a lower overpotential of 32 mV than other samples of which are 3D AgNWs/PU (529 mV), CC (432 mV), NiMo-1200s/CC (120 mV), AgNWs@NiMo/PU-600s (94 mV), AgNWs@NiMo/PU-900s (47 mV), and AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1800s (49 mV). Moreover, the overpotential of AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1200s is slightly close to that of Pt/C electrode (24 mV), indicating its superior electrocatalytic activity. To clarify HER kinetics of the electrodes, Tafel plots were constructed from the basis of LSV curves and are shown in Fig. 5c. The Tafel slopes of AgNWs@NiMo/PU-600s, AgNWs@NiMo/PU-900s, AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1200s, AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1800s, and NiMo-1200s/CC electrodes are 135, 113, 94, 72, 97 mV dec-1, respectively. The lowest slope of AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1200s catalyst is 72 mV dec-1. These results suggest that the electrode of AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1200s further shows higher catalytic activity and excellent kinetics for HER. It is well known that HER catalytic activity of electrocatalysts is closely related to electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) [36]. Detecting of ECSA by electrochemical double layer capacitance (Cdl), the larger Cdl value indicates that the electrocatalyst has a larger number of exposed active catalytic sites, which facilitates the adsorption of water molecules [49]. As shown in Fig. S5, The Cdl of AgNWs@NiMo/PU catalysts were tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV) at different scanning rates in the non-faradaic potential range from 0.074 to 0.174 V (vs. RHE). In addition, the ECSA of AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1200s (86.6 mF cm−2) is higher than AgNWs@NiMo/PU-600s (38.8 mF cm−2), AgNWs@NiMo/PU-900s (75.6 mF cm−2), and AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1800s (74.3 mF cm−2) (Fig. 5d), proving that the AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1200s electrode has excellent electrocatalytic performance for HER. And electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Fig. 5e) also reflects lower resistance of AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1200s. Furthermore, the equivalent circuit of the EIS is shown in Fig. 5f. As shown in Table S1, AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1200s has the lowest charge transfer resistance (Rct), indicating a much faster electron transfer process on it. Besides the electrochemical activity, cycle performance is another critical parameter to evaluate an electrocatalyst. Fig. S6 shows the activity retention rate of AgNW@NiMo/PU-1200s. It obtained by Chronopotentiometry curve of AgNW@NiMo/PU-1200s during electrolysis at a constant current density of −20 mA cm−2, and as shown in Fig. 5g, compared with the electrode of AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1200s before the stability test, the hydrogen evolution performance of the electrode of AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1200s after stability test is only slightly reduced. It represents the electrocatalyst of AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1200s still maintains good catalytic stability after a long testing time of 10 h. Moreover, as shown in the Fig. 5h, to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the electrode of AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1200s after stability test exhibits a low overpotential of 43 mV. In order to further test its stability, we further tested the electrode of AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1200s after stability test by SEM (Fig. S7). It is obvious that the micro morphology of the AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1200s electrode does not change significantly, and the silver nanowires still adhere to the 3D polyurethane. This fully shows that the electrode of AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1200s has good stability. The good stability of the 3D AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1200s electrode benefits from the absence of adhesion agent in the process of hydrogen evolution and its 3D structure. Furthermore, the comparison between hydrogen evolution properties of AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1200s and those reported in recent literatures is shown in Table S2. It can be seen that the electrode of AgNWs@NiMo/PU-1200s has higher catalytic performance."
9,Conclusions,"To sum up, we have developed a new three-dimensional structure of AgNWs@NiMo/PU hydrogen evolution electrocatalyst by coating 3D AgNWs/PU with NiMo alloy. Furthermore, the main reasons for its high electrocatalytic performance are: (i) the three-dimensional structure provides a wider range of active site attachment points and good electrolyte permeability; (ii) the in-situ growth of NiMo alloy on 3D AgNWs/PU makes it unnecessary to add adhesive in the process of hydrogen evolution. (iii) The silver nanowire substrate not only provides excellent conductivity, but also improves the catalytic performance of the catalyst. And the activity of the electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution in alkaline solution is better than the most of catalysts containing NiMo alloy reported in literature. In addition, the strategy of preparing three-dimensional electrocatalysts proposed in this study can also be applied to other transition metals, which provides a new way to construct efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution."
