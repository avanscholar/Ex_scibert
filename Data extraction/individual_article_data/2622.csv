0,Introduction,"Functionalized amines, mainly produced via the catalytic reduction of nitro compounds, serve as central intermediates for the manufacture of dyes, polymers, agrochemicals, herbicides, pharmaceuticals, and various other industrially important fine chemicals [1–3]. Generally, amines can be produced using the catalytic hydrogenation technology. In terms of the different hydrogen sources, two main methods, i.e., (i) the direct use of molecular H2 as the hydrogen source or (ii) catalytic transfer hydrogenation, are used for the hydrogenation of nitro compounds. The catalytic transfer hydrogenation route avoids the use of gaseous hydrogen and high-pressure apparatus and instead uses liquid hydrogen donors such as NaBH4 [4], ammonia borane [5], formic acid [6], and hydrazine hydrate (N2H4·H2O) [7]. Among these various hydrogen donors, N2H4·H2O is regarded as a promising reductant by virtue of its controllable chemoselectivity and low energy consumption. Notably, N2H4·H2O produces only N2 and H2O (environmentally benign byproducts), which guarantees its environmental friendliness and the purity of the anilines [7]. Various supported noble metal-based catalysts have also been explored [8–10]. However, their high cost, scarcity, and low selectivity are the major difficulties that considerably limit their large-scale industrial application. To overcome these difficulties, extensive efforts have been devoted toward transition metal-based heterogeneous catalysts (such as Fe, Co, and Ni) for the selective hydrogenation of nitro groups to the corresponding amine compounds [11–19]. For example, Xu et al. constructed Co@NC nanocomposites with tunable Co contents that could be applied as highly active catalysts for the chemoselective reduction of nitrobenzene [16]. Zhou et al. synthesized Ni-based KIT–6 catalysts via the designed engineering approaches, obtaining an aniline yield of 100% at 90 °C and when applying a H2 pressure of 1 MPa for 1 h [17]. Yang et al. prepared FeS2/NSC nanocatalysts through the sequential hydrothermal treatment, high-temperature carbonization, and sulfurization procedures using biomass as the N and C sources and Fe(NO3)3 as the Fe source. The prepared nanocatalysts exhibited good tolerance for the catalytic hydrogenation of various functionalized nitroarenes in water [18]. Despite these achievements in the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroarenes, there is still a lack of understanding regarding the hydrogenation mechanism [19]. Moreover, majority of the reported nonnoble metal catalysts are susceptible to aggregation and/or leaching during their practical usage, inevitably resulting in irremediable activity decay [20]. Despite the inherent challenges, there is an urgent need to design highly efficient transition metal catalysts and clarify their reaction mechanism [21]. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging as a class of crystalline porous materials with interesting physicochemical properties, including tunable composition and structure as well as favorable metal ion dispersion [22–25]. Based on a simple direct pyrolysis strategy, MOFs, which are self-sacrificing templates/precursors, can be readily converted into carbon-based composites with controllable compositions [26,27], wherein tiny metal and/or metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) are highly dispersed within the porous carbon networks [28–30]. Compared with other metals, iron, as an earth-abundant, low-cost, low-toxicity, and magnetically recyclable element, is a promising candidate for replacing precious metals to develop environmentally benign processes [31]. As a template, a representative Fe-based MOF [MIL–88A(Fe)] was reported to derive magnetic γ–Fe2O3 NPs embedded in porous carbon via high-temperature pyrolysis, which then served as an effective catalyst for the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of functionalized nitroarenes [32]. Amino-decorated MIL–101(Fe) [NH2–MIL–101(Fe)] is a typical MOF material with a large specific surface area, a well-defined porous structure, abundant amino groups, and homogeneous dispersed metal iron sites [33–36]. In this study, we presynthesized NH2–MIL–101(Fe) as the precursor to construct a series of Fe-based nanocatalysts with unusual Fe/Fe3C activated sites uniformly inlaid into N-doped porous carbon supports (denoted as Fe/Fe3C@NC–T, where T represents the pyrolysis temperature). We then investigated their catalytic performance in the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of nitro compounds to the corresponding amines using N2H4·H2O as the reducant (Scheme 1 ). The N atoms incorporated in the catalyst play an important role in tuning the electronic properties of the metal sites [37–39], significantly enhancing the catalytic performance of the derived catalysts. The as-prepared Fe/Fe3C@NC–T nanocomposites exhibited high activity, absolute chemoselectivity, and tolerance for the hydrogenation of a series of functionalized nitroarenes under mild conditions. Furthermore, these Fe nanocomposites could be rapidly separated from the reaction system using an external magnetic field and recycled at least nine times without any decay in catalytic activity and selectivity."

3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained with a Philips PW3040/60 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) with an operation voltage of 40 kV and operation current of 30 mA. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument at − 196 °C after outgassing of the samples at 200 °C under vacuum for 16 h. Surface area, micropore volume, and pore size distribution were determined using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, t-plot analysis, and density functional theory approach, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a Hitachi S-4800 microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired using JEM2100F apparatus operated at 200 kV.

Magnetic hysteresis loops were determined on a Lakeshore Model 7404 vibrating sample magnetometer at 25 °C. The actual amount of Fe in the Fe/Fe3C@NC samples was measured using an inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (ICP–AES, I CAP-QC T, USA). Elemental analysis of C, N, O and H was performed on a vario elcube elemental analysis instrument.

The UV–visible (UV–vis) diffuse reflectance spectrum was recorded on a ThermoFisher Nicolet Evolution 500 spectrophotometer, in which BaSO4 was used as the background."
4,Catalyst preparation,"2.3 Catalyst preparation NH2–MIL–101(Fe): NH2–MIL–101(Fe) was synthesized according to a previously reported procedure [40]. Briefly, FeCl3·6H2O (1.125 g, 4.16 mmol) and NH2–BDC (0.374 g, 2.07 mmol) were mixed in DMF (25 mL) and stirred for 30 min at room temperature to obtain a homogeneous solution. Then, the solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave (50 mL) and solvothermally reacted at 110 °C for 24 h. The products were collected via centrifugation and purified thrice using DMF and methanol. The purified sorrel product was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h to obtain NH2–MIL–101(Fe). MIL–101(Fe) was synthesized according to the same procedure as that for NH2–MIL–101(Fe), except that BDC was used as the organic ligand. Fe/Fe3C@NC: The Fe/Fe3C@NC nanocatalysts were fabricated via a high-temperature carbonization treatment method. A porcelain boat containing NH2–MIL–101(Fe) powder (0.5 g) was placed in a tube furnace heated to the target temperature at a ramp of 3 °C/min under N2 gas atmosphere (40 mL/min). The boat was maintained at the desired temperature for 3 h and then naturally cooled to the ambient temperature. The black powder obtained was denoted as Fe/Fe3C@NC–T (where T represents the thermolysis temperature from 650 °C to 800 °C). Fe/FexO@C–750: The Fe/FexO@C–750 control sample without N doping was prepared according to a procedure similar to that used for preparing Fe/Fe3C@NC–750, except that MIL–101(Fe) was used as the precursor. Fe–Nx@NC–750: To remove the Fe/Fe3C NPs, the Fe/Fe3C@NC–750 powder (0.25 g) was placed into a round-bottomed flask (100 mL) before a solution containing H2O, H2SO4, and HNO3 (50 mL) in a volume ratio of 3:2:1 was slowly added to the flask. The flask was shaken and subjected to ultrasonic treatment for 5 min. The solution was further heated at 80 °C for 24 h, followed by suction filtration and thorough washing using water and methanol. Finally, the acid-treated sample was dried at 120 °C overnight in a vacuum oven."
5,Catalytic activity test,"2.4 Catalytic activity test The catalytic hydrogenation of nitroarene was performed in a Schlenk tube (25 mL). In a typical reaction, the catalyst (20 mg), nitrobenzene (1 mmol), and hydrazine hydrate (4 mmol) were sequentially added into a dried tube with ethanol (5 mL). Then, a thermostatic bath was connected to the tube for obtaining condensation, and the mixture was vigorously stirred at a reaction temperature of 60 °C. The conversion and selectivity of sampling after the catalyst was removed via centrifugation was analyzed on a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2014) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a capillary column (DB-5, 30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm) with n-dodecane as the internal standard. Further, the products were identified using the Agilent 7890A/5976 GC/MS system. To minimize accidental experimental errors, all the experiments were performed in triplicate, and the observed error was within ± 2% in each case. For the durability test, Fe/Fe3C@NC–750 was separated from the reaction solution using an external magnet before being washed with acetone several times and dried at 120 °C for 12 h. It was then used for the subsequent reaction cycle."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The crystal structure and phase composition of the NH2–MIL–101(Fe) precursor and its derived composites were obtained using XRD. The XRD patterns of NH2–MIL–101(Fe) completely coincided with the simulated patterns of MIL–101(Cr) reported in the literature (see Fig. S1, Supporting Information) [41], confirming the successful synthesis of the pure-phase MOF precursor. In addition, the characteristic peaks that can be attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of the primary amine group, inplane skeletal vibration of the benzene ring, and Fe–O stretching vibration can be clearly discerned over the prepared NH2–MIL–101(Fe) (Fig. S2) [35], which is in good agreement with the XRD results. As shown in Fig. S3, NH2-MIL-101(Fe) exhibits distinct optical response from 300 to 800 nm due to the presence of μ-O-Fe cluster and − NH2 group [42]. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the as-prepared Fe/Fe3C@NC–T samples, which exhibited quite similar profiles even though the samples were produced by the thermal pyrolysis of the NH2–MIL–101(Fe) precursor at different temperatures. Notably, all the derived samples exhibited two obvious characteristic diffraction peaks centered at 45° and 65° that are well indexed to the (110) and (200) planes, respectively, of cubic Fe (JCPDS No. 06–0696) [43]. Moreover, the characteristic diffraction profiles assigned to the Fe3C species could be clearly distinguished across the various samples (JCPDS No. 35–0722) [44], likely owing to the in situ reaction between the iron and carbon species components during the high-temperature annealing procedure. In contrast, no detectable peaks ascribable to iron oxides, such as Fe2O3 and Fe3O4, could be detected from the XRD profiles of the derived samples. Furthermore, there existed a weak diffraction hump at approximately 26.5° for all the derived samples, which was attributed to the partially formed (002) plane of graphitic carbon [45]. This result indicates the formation of a graphitic structure during pyrolysis. Additionally, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1, the enlarged diffraction peak became sharper with the increasing pyrolysis temperature, implying that more significant graphitization occurred in Fe/Fe3C@NC–T samples upon high-temperature carbothermal treatment. These results confirmed that graphitic carbon, metallic Fe, and Fe3C species coexisted in the derived catalysts. Furthermore, from the ICP–AES analysis, the Fe contents were estimated to be 44.9%–52.8% (Table S1, Supporting Information), and the N content decreased from 3.8 to 2.1 wt% when the pyrolysis temperature was increased from 650 °C to 800 °C for the derived composites (Table S2). The pore structure characteristics and specific surface areas of various pyrolyzed samples were determined based on the N2 adsorption measurements. As shown in Fig. 2 A, all the hybrids revealed characteristic type-IV isothermal curves along with apparent H3 hysteresis loops in the P/P0 range of 0.4–1.0, indicating the presence of hierarchical porous structures. As further confirmed by the pore size distribution in Fig. 2B, typical micropores (approximately from 0.7 to 1.4 nm) and mesopores (approximately 20 nm) coexisted in the hybrids along with a certain number of macropores (>50 nm). Notably, all the Fe/Fe3C@NC–T samples had the hight specific surface areas (>200 m2/g) and pore volumes (≥0.28 cm3/g) (Table S1, see Supporting Information). The abundant hierarchical porous characteristic and tunable Fe-based metal sites in Fe/Fe3C@NC–T were partially inherited from the NH2–MIL–101(Fe) precursor. On account of their large specific surface areas and pore volumes, the derived Fe/Fe3C@NC–T catalysts were expected to enable sufficient contact between the active sites and reactants, enhancing the catalytic transfer hydrogenation performance [46]. XPS analysis was performed to analyze the elemental composition and bonding configuration of the formed Fe/Fe3C@NC–T samples. The existence of C, O, N, and Fe elements can be verified based on the typical XPS survey spectra of the resultant composites (Fig. S4). The high-resolution Fe 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 3 A and S5–S8) were utilized to estimate the diverse valence states of the Fe species. The peaks centered at 725.2 and 711.3 eV can be attributed to Fe3+ 2p3/2 and Fe3+ 2p1/2, respectively [45]. In combination with the XRD results, it could be confirmed that the Fe3C species were present in the as-synthesized catalysts [47]. However, the XPS signals of metallic Fe species were not observed, and the content of Fe elements detected by XPS (approximately 0.14%–0.3%, see Table S3) was significantly lower than that measured by ICP–AES (approximately 44.9%–47.9%, Table S1), which may have been caused due to the encapsulation of the Fe and Fe3C species by graphitic carbon layers [48]. Furthermore, the N 1 s spectra (Fig. 3B) of the as-fabricated Fe/Fe3C@NC–T hybrids could be deconvoluted into four well-resolved peaks, which can be attributed to oxidized N (403.1 eV), graphitic N (401.1 eV), pyrrolic N (399.8 eV), and pyridinic N (398.5 eV) [49–51], indicating that the N elements were successfully incorporated into the carbon matrix. The relative contents of different N species could be quantified on the basis of the integrated peak areas of N, with the specific data summarized in Fig. S9. Apparently, the pyridinic N and pyrrolic N contents decreased significantly with the increasing annealing temperatures, whereas the proportions of graphitic N gradually increased, implying the thermal instability of the pyrrolic and pyridinic N [52]. Importantly, the pyridinic and pyrrolic N species may have interacted with the metal moieties (such as Fe) and/or reactants [53], which is likely to boost the catalytic performance. In addition, the FT–IR spectra of Fe/Fe3C@NC–T are shown in Fig. S10; the peaks at 3420 cm−1 can be attributed to the N–H bond, whereas those at 1620, 1380, and 1120 cm−1 may be attributed to the C = O, C = N, and C–N/C–O bonds, respectively [54]. Then, Raman spectroscopy was used to investigate the structural features of the formed Fe/Fe3C@NC hybrids. Fig. 4 shows the clearly observable D band at 1355 cm−1 and the G band at 1590 cm−1 for all the Fe/Fe3C@NC–T hybrids, originating from the disorder characteristics induced by lattice defects and the inplane vibration of the sp2-bonded atoms, respectively [55], based on which the formation of graphitic carbon can be confirmed. Furthermore, a weak peak can be observed at approximately 2680 cm−1 for Fe/Fe3C@NC–800, indicating a graphene-like architecture [56]. The high ratio of the intensities of the D and G bands (ID/IG) verified the presence of abundant structural defects in the derived N-doped porous carbon support, which is considered beneficial for the acceleration of mass transfer and for providing adequate exposure of the active sites for catalysis [57,58]. Fig. 5 shows the typical magnetization hysteresis curve of the Fe/Fe3C@NC–T samples. All the samples displayed similar superparamagnetic behaviors owing to the effect of Fe-based NPs, which have a saturation magnetization as high as 87.7 emu/g. Consequently, the strong ferromagnetic properties of the derived samples render them convenient for easy separation from the reaction system in the presence of an external magnetic field, facilitating catalyst recycling and repeated usage [59]. The SEM images revealed that the NH2–MIL–101(Fe) microcrystals comprised well-dispersed octahedrons with sizes of approximately 400 nm (Fig. 6 A and 6B). After annealing at high temperature, the NH2–MIL–101(Fe) octahedrons evolved into Fe/Fe3C@NC–T. Represented by Fe/Fe3C@NC–750 (Fig. 6E), the original polyhedral structure of the MOF precursor was almost maintained, whereas the size was slightly reduced because of decomposition and shrinkage of the MOF frameworks during thermal pyrolysis treatment [60]. On the other hand, the external surface of the hybrids became rougher because of the presence of an abundant porous carbon structure. TEM observations were further used to evaluate the dispersion of Fe/Fe3C NPs in the porous carbon support. Many Fe/Fe3C NPs were highly embedded in individual octahedrons, with Fe-based NPs mainly having sizes of 1–3 nm (Fig. 7 A and S11). Further observations indicated that some large Fe/Fe3C NPs at the core were tightly encapsulated by the continuous carbon layers, forming core-/shell-structured Fe/Fe3C@NC (yellow circle of Fig. 7C). Clear lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.35 nm could be observed from the high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 7D), coinciding with the (200) plane of metallic Fe. Furthermore, a distinct lattice fringe with a spacing of 0.27 nm corresponded with the (211) plane of Fe3C (Fig. 7D). Multilayered carbon shells can serve as a protective layer to effectively impede the agglomeration and leaching of the interior Fe/Fe3C NPs, ensuring that the active sites were highly stable when used in the liquid-phase reaction system [61]."
8,Catalytic properties,"3.2 Catalytic properties Subsequently, the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of nitrobenzene was performed as a benchmark reaction for exploring the catalytic behavior of various MOF-pyrolyzed Fe/Fe3C@NC catalysts using hydrazine hydrate as the reductant. All the as-synthesized Fe/Fe3C@NC–T catalysts were highly active for this transformation but exhibited no obvious difference in reactivity (entries 1–4, Table 1 ). Among the derived catalysts, the catalytic activity of Fe/Fe3C@NC–750 was slightly higher than those of the remaining catalysts, and it could almost quantitatively complete the transfer hydrogenation of nitrobenzene with absolute selectivity for aniline (entry 3). Notably, no conversion occurred in the absence of a catalyst or when considering a lack of hydrazine hydrate (entries 5 and 6). These results reinforce that both the Fe/Fe3C@NC catalysts and hydrazine hydrate are prerequisites for the transfer hydrogenation of nitrobenzenes. A series of control experiments were performed to thoroughly understand the individual contribution of the Fe-containing sites in the catalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene. All the control experiments employing commercially available Fe, Fe3C, and Fe3O4 as catalysts for hydrogenation resulted in trace amounts of aniline (entries 7–10). Moreover, the control catalyst Fe/FexO@C–750 (the analog without N doping) was examined; it exhibited very low conversion under identical conditions (entry 11). XRD analysis demonstrated that the iron components of Fe/FexO@C–750 existed mainly in the form of Fe3O4, FeO, and Fe (Fig. S12), which was consistent with the XPS result (Fig. S13). Furthermore, the specific surface area of Fe/FexO@C–750 was slightly lower than that of Fe/Fe3C@NC–T (Fig. S14 and Table S1). Such findings indicate that the incorporation of N species in the carbon support potentially results in the formation of iron carbide, which is likely to be the main active site in Fe/Fe3C@NC–750. In addition, N doping in the catalyst may help to enhance the adsorption and activation abilities of the nitroarene molecules [62]. To further identify the catalytic active species, an acid leaching experiment was performed on Fe/Fe3C@NC–750 to remove the Fe-based NPs (denoted as Fe–Nx@NC–750). The XRD, XPS, and HRTEM images of the acid-treated catalyst Fe–Nx@NC–750 (Figs. S15–S17) showed that no metallic Fe or Fe3C NPs were detected. However, apparent graphitic carbon layers were preserved, confirming that almost all the Fe-based NPs were removed via washing from Fe/Fe3C@NC–750 (Fig. S17). The specific surface area of Fe–Nx@NC–750 (309.9 m2/g) was significantly larger than that of Fe/Fe3C@NC–750 (212.2 m2/g) (Table S1), which is associated with the liberation of the space occupied by the Fe NPs. The residual Fe species within the N-doped porous carbon may be observed in the form of a single atom in the Fe–Nx configuration (Fig. S18). When Fe–Nx@NC–750 was subjected to the reaction, only a small amount of nitrobenzene could be effectively converted (entry 12), implying that the role of Fe–Nx sites is limited toward catalytic transfer hydrogenation (in comparison with Fe/Fe3C NPs). These observations unambiguously corroborate that multiple iron species and N doping in the porous carbon are synergistically responsible for the high catalytic performance toward nitrobenzene hydrogenation. Furthermore, based on the catalytic performance of other catalysts reported in the literature, Fe/Fe3C@NC–750 is considered to be equally good as them (Table S4). However, the disadvantage of this study is that the reaction temperature is relatively higher (60 °C) compared to the reports investigating the catalytic transfer hydrogenation reactions at room temperature [63,64], resulting in high operating costs in practical production. Further, a recycling experiment for the hydrogenation of o-nitrotoluene was conducted to explore the recoverability and reusability of Fe/Fe3C@NC–750. As shown in Fig. 8 A, both the conversion and selectivity could be well maintained without any decay over nine consecutive cycles, demonstrating the excellent durability of this catalyst. A hot filtration test was performed after the reaction was conducted for 30 min to verify the heterogeneous nature of the Fe/Fe3C@NC–750 catalyst. No further enhancement of conversion was observed within 2 h of the reaction under identical conditions, indicating that the catalyst was stable against leaching (Fig. 8B). The ICP–AES analysis of the reaction filtrate also showed no detectable leaching of the active Fe species during the reaction process. The recovered Fe/Fe3C@NC–750 was also characterized by XRD and TEM (Figs. S19 and S20), which confirmed that there were no obvious differences in the crystal structure or the size and distribution of the Fe-based when compared with the fresh catalyst, demonstrating that the as-prepared Fe/Fe3C@NC–750 catalyst exhibited robust stability under the evaluated reaction conditions. To date, there is a lack of understanding with respect to the reaction mechanism of the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of nitrobenzene [65]. The catalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene can proceed via two different routes, i.e., (i) a direct deoxygenation pathway, PhNO2 → PhNO → PhNHOH → PhNH2 [7], or (ii) an indirect route, in which the intermediates of nitrosobenzene (PhNO) and phenylhydroxylamine (PhNHOH) may be converted to aniline that undergoes condensation to generate azoxybenezene, which gradually reduces to aniline [66]. Because no intermediates or byproducts were detected under the optimal reaction conditions in the current study, we performed the catalytic reduction of nitrobenzene over Fe/Fe3C@NC–750 in an ice bath (0 °C) to reduce the reaction rate and identify any possible reaction intermediates. The GC–MS analysis of the reaction mixture after 2 h of reaction showed that phenylhydroxylamine, nitrosobenzene, and azoxybenzene formed during the reaction procedure (Fig. 9 ), among which the first two compounds were the main intermediates related to the direct reduction pathway. The presence of azoxybenzene suggested a possible azoxybenzene mechanism for the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline. We also tested the hydrogenation of o-nitrotoluene in an ice bath and captured the corresponding reaction intermediates (see Supporting Information in Fig. S21). These results consistently verified the coexistence of the direct route and the condensation route in the current catalytic system. However, azobenzene (as a key intermediate in the condensation route) was not observed at any stage of the reaction. Alternatively, we examined the direct reduction of pure azobenzene to aniline. 23% of the azobenzene was quickly converted into the corresponding aniline (with 90% selectivity) and hydrazobenzene (with 10% selectivity), within a short period of 1 h. Notably, hydrazobenzene was one of the intermediates likely existing in the condensation route. Based on these control experiments, both the direct hydrogenation pathway and the indirect reaction route were likely involved in our catalytic reaction system. The possible reaction path is shown in Fig. 10 . To further demonstrate the general applicability of the Fe/Fe3C@NC–750 catalyst, the hydrogenation reaction was extended to various functionalized nitro compounds. As listed in Table 2 , all the nitro substrates were consistently converted into the corresponding anilines with high conversion rates and exclusive selectivity but without any detectable byproducts. The Fe/Fe3C@NC–750 catalyst could selectively catalyze the bromo- and chloro-substituted nitroarenes to obtain the corresponding haloaromatic amines with excellent conversion (entries 1 and 2). Furthermore, the Fe/Fe3C@NC–750 catalyst could effectively promote the selective hydrogenation of the methyl-substituted nitrobenzenes to generate the desired nitroarenes in quantitative yields (entries 3–5), implying that the steric effect did not cause any negative effects on Fe/Fe3C@NC–750. Moreover, this catalyst also worked for the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of certain nitroarenes bearing other functional groups, such as amino, phenolic hydroxyl, and alcoholic hydroxyl groups, with full conversion and absolute selectivity (entries 6–8). Fe/Fe3C@NC–750 offered only target anilines via the selective catalytic hydrogenation of the nitroarenes decorated with various competing reducible moieties, including ester, ether, ketone, and nitrile moieties (entries 9–12). This notable finding emphasizes the outstanding chemoselectivity of our Fe/Fe3C@NC–750 catalyst, indicating its excellence compared with those of noble metal catalysts. Multiple nitro groups could be simultaneously converted into amino groups (entry 13). These results unambiguously indicate that Fe/Fe3C@NC–750 is highly efficient for the catalytic hydrogenation of diverse aromatic nitrobenzenes."
9,Conclusions,"In summary, we developed a series of highly efficient and magnetically recyclable Fe/Fe3C@NC nanocatalysts via the carbonization of a Fe and N-containing MOF, NH2–MIL–101(Fe), for the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of nitro compounds. The ultrasmall Fe/Fe3C NPs, with sizes of mainly 1–3 nm, were well embedded in the hierarchically porous N-doped carbon matrix, which completely impeded the aggregation/leaching of high-loading metal Fe-based active sites and facilitated rapid mass transfer. Therefore, these nanocatalysts presented extraordinarily high catalytic activity, selectivity, and durability toward the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene substrates in the presence of N2H4·H2O under mild conditions. They were also workable with various substrates involving reducible functional groups. Moreover, the developed Fe/Fe3C@NC hybrids were readily recovered using an external magnet and could be recycled at least nine times without any loss in activity, revealing prospective application to the reduction of nitrobenzenes into anilines. The combination of the characterization results and control experiments revealed that the synergistic contributions of multiple Fe-based NPs and N doping were likely the cause of the excellent catalytic performance of the Fe/Fe3C@NC hybrids."
