0,Introduction,"The world is now being threatened by serious environment and energy crisis due to the combustion of fossil fuels [1,2]. Therefore, an environmentally friendly, sustainable and cheap energy is highly required. Hydrogen is considered to be an ideal energy storage medium and a promising energy carrier to replace traditional fossil fuels [3–5]. In 1972, Fujishima and Honda found that water can be decomposed by visible light into O2 and H2 on TiO2 the photoanode [6]. Since then, photocatalytic splitting water into H2 and O2 had drawn tremendous attention among researchers because this strategy is considered to be a globally accepted way for solving the energy shortage and environmental pollution problems [7–10]. Such process which converts solar energy to chemical energy features green, clean and high efficiency [11,12]. Among various types of semiconductors, titanium dioxide (TiO2), bismuth oxide (Bi2O3), and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) have been extensively studied [13,14]. TiO2 has been paid much attention due to the low price, low toxicity, high stability during the photocatalytic reaction [15]. There are three polymorphs of titanium dioxide: rutile, anatase and brookite [16]. Among them, rutile type has a high electron-hole recombination rate, pure brookite type TiO2 is difficult to prepare, and anatase type is most applied in the field of photocatalysis [17]. The anatase phase has appropriate band gap (3.2 eV) to absorb the ultraviolet part of sunlight [18]. Bi2O3 is an important metal oxide semiconductor with band gap of 2.8 eV [19] and many oxygen vacancies which entrust Bi2O3 responsibility to visible light [20–22] since Bi2O3 has been introduced into the photocatalytic field from 1988 [23]. Polymeric g-C3N4 is a kind of metal-free, non-toxic, and narrow band gap (2.7 eV) semiconductor photocatalyst [24], corresponding to light with wavelength less than 460 nm. It has been applied in kinds of photocatalytic reactions such as water splitting, CO2 reduction, and pollutants degradation [1,25–27]. There are four main stages during the process of photocatalytic water splitting for H2 production: (1) Semiconductor absorbs photons with certain energy to produce electron-hole pairs. (2) Spatial separation of electrons and holes and the charge carriers migrate to the semiconductor surface, or, the recombination of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs occurs in the bulk material. (3) Protons absorbed on the surface of the catalyst reacts with electrons to produce H2. (4) H2O absorbed on the surface of catalyst reacts with holes to produce oxygen [13]. However, the efficiency of hydrogen production is quite low due to the recombination of electrons and holes. To achieve higher hydrogen production efficiency, many researchers added the electron donors called sacrificial agents into the reaction system, so that the sacrificial agents can react with the holes irreversibly and improve the hydrogen production efficiency [28]. The sacrificial agents used in the studies were mainly of the following types: amine (TEOA, for example.), alcohols (ethanol and methanol), organic acid (lactic acid, for example), sulfide/sulfite (S2−/SO3 2−) etc. [3,29–33]. But because the price of the sacrificial agents is high and it might be another source of energy (such as methanol), it is expensive and impractical to add them in practical applications [34]. Therefore, the sacrificial agents should be cheap and easy to obtain, one feasible way is to use the organic pollutants in wastewater as sacrificial agents [28]. Previous studies have demonstrated that organic pollutants in waste water can be used as the sacrificial agents and promote the hydrogen production [35–37]. 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP), a widely used fungicide, herbicide, insecticide and antiseptic, has been recognized as one of the greatest toxic contaminants and frequently detected in surface, ground, and drinking waters [38]. At the same time, 2,4,6-TCP might act as a reductive agent and a valid electron donors which might facilitate the hydrogen production. Through the synergistic effect of 2,4,6-TCP degradation and photocatalytic hydrogen production, the dual aim of pollution control and clean energy production can be achieved simultaneously. Ultrasonic atomization is a promising technique which produces fine droplets with diameters less than 10 μm [39]. Some researchers have combined the photocatalytic process with ultrasonic atomization technique and put forward sono-photocatalysis. Several studies demonstrated that ultrasonic atomization reduced the reaction time and the amount of reagents under moderate reaction conditions [40]. Therefore, sono-photocatalysis have been reported to improve the degradation efficiency of pollutants [39,41–43]. In this study, a high efficiency ultrasonic atomization photocatalytic reactor was designed and built. Photocatalytic hydrogen production with ultrasonic atomization was investigated by using different types of catalyst (mesoporous TiO2, g-C3N4 and mesoporous Bi2O3), catalyst concentration, and ultrasonic atomization. Furthermore, the synergism on the 2,4,6-TCP removal and hydrogen production were investigated. The feasibility to achieve the dual aims of pollution control and clean energy is introduced and evaluated. Finally, we proposed the mechanism and models for hydrogen production by photocatalytic degradation of 2,4,6-TCP in atomized droplets."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals All chemicals used in the experiments were analytical grade or higher and were used as received without further purification. 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP, 98%), melamine (99%), bismuth nitrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O), nitric acid (HNO3, 38%), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 98%)，triethanolamine (TEOA, C6H15NO3), absolute ethyl alcohol (CH3CH2OH), chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6·6H2O), tetrabutyl orthotianate (TBOT), titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), P123 (polyoxyethane-polyoxypropane- polyoxyethane, blockpolyether, EO20-PO70-EO20, MW = 5800), cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTMAB, C16H33(CH3)3NBr). All solutions were prepared with deionized water throughout the experiments by a Milli-Q machine."
3,Synthesis of photocatalyst,"2.2 Synthesis of photocatalyst The mesoporous TiO2 (mTiO2) was synthesized by hydrothermal method from a mixture inorganic precursors (TBOT and TiCl4) and non-aqueous medium [44]. The specific preparation steps are as follows: anhydrous ethanol was used as the solvent. P123 and CTAB were used as structural guidance agents (SDA). 0.34 mmol of P123 was stirred and dissolved in 0.7 mol of anhydrous ethanol at room temperature, then 0.012 mol TBOT and 0.006 mol of TiCl4 were added to the solution, and the mixture was further stirred until a clear solution was obtained. Then transfer the solution to a cultural dish, evaporate the solvent under the 100 °C, and let stand for aging. The viscosity of the solution will increase as the aging, until the titanate gel was obtained. Finally, the sample was calcined under 550 °C in air for 6 h to remove the SDA. The g-C3N4 was fabricated by direct pyrolysis of melamine [45]. 0.08 mol of melamine ground powders were pressed to tablet and placed into a semi-closed alumina crucible and heated in a tube furnace with the heating rate of 20 °C min−1. Then put the sample stay at tube furnace 500 °C for 2 h. After cooling to the room temperature, yellow g-C3N4 samples were obtained. Further grinding is required to obtain smaller grain sizes. Besides, acidizing stripping method was introduced to the preparation of nano-catalyst. 1.0 g of block g-C3N4 sample was put into 50 mL conical flask. A certain amount of H2SO4 was then added to the flask and stirred for about 5 h with a magnetic stirring device at room temperature. Slowly pour the received mixture into 500 mL deionized water and let the solution obtained stand at room temperature for another 5 h. After that, pour out the supernatant and rinse several times until the solution is neutral. Finally, the samples were freeze-dried and ground in an agate mortar for later use. Bi2O3 is a visible light response metal oxide semiconductor which has been further treatment for the developed mesoporous structure, named as mesoporous Bi2O3 (mBi2O3) [46]. Typically, 24.0 mmol Bi(NO3)3 was dissolved in pure acetic acid and the pH value was adjusted less than 2.8 using nitric acid. The solution was continuously stirred for 8 h and then transferred to the autogenic pressure kettle with Teflon lining. Put the autogenic pressure kettle into the oven and set the temperature to 150 °C and maintain 24 h. After that, filter and collect the samples obtained, and anneal samples at room temperature to 600 °C with 10 °C min−1 heating rate. Keep the sample at 600 °C for 3 h."
4,Characterizations of photocatalysts,"2.3 Characterizations of photocatalysts The microstructure and morphology of the obtained samples (TiO2, g-C3N4 and Bi2O3) were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, X650, Hitachi, JP). The crystalline structures were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, X’Pert Pro MPD, PANalytical, NL) equipped with a Cu Ka X-ray source. UV–vis absorption spectrum was recorded on a spectrophotometer (DR 6000, Hach; Loveland, USA) in the wavelength range from 200 nm to 500 nm. The diffusion reflection spectra (DRS) of samples were recorded on an ultraviolet spectrophotometer (Cary 500, Varian, USA). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area was measured on a Quantachrome Autosorb-6B instrument (USA)."
5,Photocatalytic experiments,"2.4 Photocatalytic experiments The experiment setup for 2,4,6-TCP and hydrogen production from atomized catalyst suspension is shown in Fig. 1 . The UV light (254 nm) was placed perpendicularly inside of the vessel (1000 mL), and an 2.4-MHz ultrasonic atomizer was placed at the bottom of the reactor and kept immersed in the liquid level of catalyst suspension. The solution containing catalyst and pollutants is continuously stirred with a magnetic stirrer located below. In this experiment, 2,4,6-TCP was selected as the target pollutant, the mTiO2, g-C3N4 and mBi2O3 are selected as the model photocatalysts. Three concentration gradients (0.01, 0.05, 0.1 g L−1) were adopted to determine the effect of catalyst concentration on the activity of photocatalytic hydrogen production and 2,4,6-TCP degradation. According to the preliminary results, 2,4,6-TCP concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography (U-3000, Dionex Co., Ltd., USA). After centrifugation, the samples are transferred to the vials and passed into a liquid chromatograph for detection. According to the results of liquid chromatography analysis, the concentration of pollutant was monitored. The concentration of hydrogen produced was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-2020 N, Tateworth Co., Ltd., CHN). Collect 0.1 mL sample into the gas chromatograph to obtain the hydrogen peak area which can be calculated to concentration of hydrogen in the atmosphere."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of photocatalysts,"3.1 Characterization of photocatalysts At first, the selected photocatalysts have been analyzed morphologically and structurally. The preparation methods of the three catalysts (mTiO2, g-C3N4 and mBi2O3) all involved calcining and annealing processes, all the three samples have crystal structures. The morphology of mTiO2, g-C3N4 and mBi2O3 was studied by SEM images, as presented in Fig. 2 . The SEM image of mTiO2 is shown in Fig. 2c. The size distribution of the as-prepared mTiO2 particles is uneven, ranging from tens of nanometers to hundreds of nanometers, and the particles are easy to aggregate to form aggregates [47]. The morphology of mTiO2 is mainly spherical and ellipsoidal. It can also be found that the large particles are clustered by many nano-sized particles and the particles have developed small particle structure, which is conducive to the adsorption and catalytic degradation of pollutants on the surface of photocatalyst. As demonstrated in Fig. 2b, it can be seen that the g-C3N4 have the typical peel layer structure. The particle size is larger (>100 nm), and the surface of the particle is covered with mottled flaky structure, similar to the blooming petals. This is owing to the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid. The strong acid environment causes erosion effect on g-C3N4 nanosheet layer and leads to the destruction of interlayer interaction force and sheet swelling. The mBi2O3 sample particles prepared at high temperature are irregular blocks with tens to more than a hundred nanometers (shown in Fig. 2a). The particle may be a crystalline grain of the mixture consisting of Bi2O2CO3, Bi2O2CO3 and β-Bi2O3. The SEM image shows a unique lamellar structure, and the thickness of sheet size is 22–27 nm. The crystallite phase of mTiO2, g-C3N4 and mBi2O3 was analyzed by XRD analysis. Fig. 3 a is the XRD pattern of the as-prepared mTiO2, the identified peaks at 25.4°, 37.9°, 48.1° and 55.1° can be indexed to the (101), (004), (200) and (211) planes of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS no.21–1272). There is also small quantities of rutile TiO2 (JCPDS card no.21–1276) [14]. Research has shown that mixed-phase TiO2 (containing small quantities of rutile in anatase) can promote the photocatalytic activity [48]. The XRD pattern of g-C3N4 (Fig. 3b) shows a peak at 27.4°. The high-angle peak at 27.4° was characteristic of an interplanar steaking peak of hexatomic ring layers, which was indexed as (002) crystallographic plane corresponding to the average interlayer distance d = 0.326 nm [49], the sharper the (002) crystallographic plane is, the better the crystallinity is [50]. For the mBi2O3 photocatalyst treated by high-temperature annealing (Fig. 3c), the XRD pattern for mBi2O3 displays the peaks in 27.4°, 33.3° and 45.1°, corresponding to (120), (200) and (232) of mBi2O3 (JCPDS no. 41–1449). In addition, several tiny peaks of the impurity phase Bi19O30 were observed (tetragonal, JCPDS no. 39–0275). Besides, the N2 adsorption-desorption test was used to measure the pore structure of catalysts. The BET surface area of mTiO2, g-C3N4 and mBi2O3 are 35.2, 45.4 and 42.7 m2 g−1, respectively. In addition to the morphology and crystal structure of catalyst, the optical properties can also has a significant effect on the catalytic activity [51]. UV–vis is a traditional characteristics to analyze the absorptivity of semiconductor, and then determine the band gap of the corresponding photocatalyst. The optical absorptivity of mTiO2, g-C3N4 and mBi2O3 was analyzed by UV–vis DRS (shown in Fig. 4 ). It can be seen that the adsorption edge of mTiO2 is much steeper than the adsorption edges of the other two catalysts (g-C3N4 and mBi2O3). Therefore, the light absorption edge of mTiO2, g-C3N4 and mBi2O3 are determined to be 385 nm, 516 nm and 477 nm, respectively. And the g-C3N4 and mBi2O3 show quite high visible light absorption capacities. The band gap energy (E g) of photocatalyst can be calculated through Kubelka-Munk formula: (1) (αhν) n/2 = A(hν – Eg) Where α, h, ν and A are the absorption coefficient, Plank’s constant, frequency and a constant concerned with valence band and conduction band. For the indirect band gap materials, n is equal to 4 [52]. Thus, the calculated E g values of mTiO2, g-C3N4 and mBi2O3 are 3.0, 2.4 and 2.6 eV, respectively. The difference of E g was mainly attributed to the difference of energy levels induced by the different crystalline phases of catalysts."
8,Photocatalytic H2 production,"3.2 Photocatalytic H2 production 3.2.1 Photocatalytic hydrogen production without ultrasonication Under the UV light irradiation, the photocatalytic activities for hydrogen were evaluated via the photocatalytic degradation of an 2,4,6-TCP aqueous solution without ultrasonic atomization. Besides, the effect of catalyst concentration on hydrogen was also evaluated (Fig. 5 ). As is shown in Fig. 5, no hydrogen was detected without the addition of any catalyst. While after introducing 0.01 g L−1 of catalyst to the photocatalytic system, the hydrogen yield increased sharply. All the three photocatalysts, including mTiO2, g-C3N4 and mBi2O3 exhibited strong photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production. Among them, g-C3N4 showed the highest hydrogen production rate (530 mmol g−1) after 120 min of irradiation, much higher than that of mBi2O3 (250 mmol g−1) under the same condition. This result might attribute to the higher excellent photoabsorptivity and suitable conduction band, as demonstrated by characterization. Fig. 5a outlines the photocatalytic hydrogen production over mTiO2 with different concentration. Unexpectedly, with the increase of mTiO2 concentration, the hydrogen production efficiency decreases immediately. This can be explained by the optical shielding effect of the high concentration catalyst and nanoparticles in water which block the transmission of light. Thus the efficiency of each active site is seriously inhibited. The hydrogen production performance of g-C3N4 and Bi2O3 experienced the same process, similar to that of mTiO2. The highest hydrogen yield of g-C3N4 and Bi2O3 reach 683 mmol g−1 and 150 mmol g−1, respectively. These results implies that the photocatalytic hydrogen production is a severely restricted reaction by light transmittance, especially under the irradiation of UV-light. 3.2.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen production with ultrasonication The effect of ultrasonication on the hydrogen production was further investigated. As shown in Fig. 6 a, when the ultrasonic atomization process was introduced, the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency improved remarkably. And the highest hydrogen yield was 2823 mmol g−1 at the 0.01 g L−1 of TiO2, more than 6 times than that without ultrasonic atomization. With the increase of the TiO2 concentration, the hydrogen production efficiency decreases similarly, suggesting that the light shielding effect still effect even under the ultrasonic atomization condition. This can be inferred that ultrasonic atomization of suspension can disperse nano-catalyst excellently and avoid the aggregation of nano-particles. What is more, we found that the droplets after ultrasonic atomization had particle diameters on the micro scale and the liquid film on the catalyst surface is very thin. So that the mass transfer of the pollutants was much restricted and light shielding was reduced. After introducing the ultrasonic atomization process, the highest hydrogen productions on g-C3N4 and Bi2O3 are 4203 mmol g−1 and 2293 mmol g−1, respectively, and is ca. 6 times and 9 times higher than that on the same catalyst without ultrasonic atomization."
9,"Photocatalytic degradation of 2,4,6-TCP","3.3 Photocatalytic degradation of 2,4,6-TCP In the previous experiment, we found that 2,4,6-TCP is highly stable under UV light irradiation and shows negligible loss of concentration. Fig. 7 shown the direct photolysis and photocatalytic degradation of 2,4,6-TCP in solution or in mist. Obviously, the concentration of 2,4,6-TCP did not change too much under the irradiation of UV light, suggesting the strong photostability of 2,4,6-TCP. 2,4,6-TCP can be removed by photocatalysis, but the removal efficiency proved to be not as fast as expected. After 120 min of treatment, only 60.2% 2,4,6-TCP can be removed from the solution. Impressively, the ultrasonic atomization has a significant acceleration on the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants. The degradation of 2,4,6-TCP by mTiO2 under ultrasonic atomization performed very quickly, and the final degradation ratio was up to 99% or more, indicating the photo shielding effect is a strictly restriction on the performance of certain photocatalysts. Besides, the mass transfer, not only 2,4,6-TCP, but also the free radicals, will be tremendously reinforced as well. The hydrogen production while the degradation of 2,4,6-TCP under the same condition by g-C3N4 is shown in Fig. 7b. Definitely, the results indicated that both g-C3N4 and atomization promoted the degradation rate, reaching almost the complete degradation within 30 min. Even g-C3N4 proved to be not a good photocatalyst which only removed less than 40% of 2,4,6-TCP in 120min. The similar phenomena was observed as shown in Fig. 7c. The results show that the degradation of 2,4,6-TCP is very fast under 254 nm ultraviolet light irradiation, and almost all of it is degraded within 30 min. On the other side, the hydrogen production efficiencies was not much influenced by the presence or absence of 2,4,6-TCP. As shown in Fig. 8 a, expectedly, the hydrogen production by mTiO2 in atomic droplets reached as high as 4375 mmol g−1, much higher than that of without 2,4,6-TCP (2823 mmol g−1) after irradiation of 120 min. Similarly, the hydrogen yield over g-C3N4 with 2,4,6-TCP is also higher than that in blank solution by 30% (6012 mmol g−1 vs. 4203 mmol g−1). The only difference occurred on the mBi2O3 with which in atomic droplet of 2,4,6-TCP will decrease the hydrogen production from 2293 mmol g−1 to 1467 mmol g−1. Generally, 2,4,6-TCP acts as the reinforce for the electron donor and accelerates the hydrogen production. However, when 2,4,6-TCP work with mBi2O3, the photo-generated electrons from mBi2O3 might be at a lower reduction potential due to the lower conduction band minimum (CBM). For sample, CBM of Bi2O3 is 0.7 eV (Φre = 0.38) vs. TiO2 0.05 eV, or g-C3N4 –1.06 eV [53], therefore, the major obstacles of hydrogen production over mBi2O3 might not attributed to the recombination of photogenerated electron and hole, but the utilization of available photo-generated electron. To some extent, the 2,4,6-TCP might consume a fraction of photo-generated electrons by dehalogenation reactions, which might cause the decrease of the hydrogen evolution."
10,Synergistic mechanism,"3.4 Synergistic mechanism From the above analyses, the mechanism of the degradation process for 2,4,6-TCP and hydrogen production with ultrasonic atomization might be proposed as shown in Fig. 9 . The photocatalyst participate the photocatalytic reaction on the surface of the droplets in the mist. The 2,4,6-TCP dissolved in the droplets containing catalyst nanoparticles. The main steps for the photocatalytic hydrogen production, simultaneously, degradation of 2,4,6-TCP might involve the reaction as follows:. (2) UV light + catalyst → e– + h+ (3) h+ + H2O (l) →·OH + H+ (4) h+ /·OH + 2,4,6-TCP → degradation products (5) 2H+ + 2e− → H2 Therefore, the photocatalytic hydrogen production and 2,4,6-TCP degradation can be described as follows: (1) First, when the energy of protons exceed the bandgap of the catalyst, the electron (e–) and hole (h+) pairs will generate from the photocatalytic particles and react with the water into oxidative (·OH, O2 − and 1O2) and reduction radicals (·H and eaq –) [54], (2) Surface chemical reactions between these radicals and 2,4,6-TCP, involving oxidation (primary) and reduction (secondary) reaction; (3) Then two H+ combine with two eaq −, or directly from two ·H, to form H2 and escape from the solution [55], and h+ or ·OH obtained from water oxidize the 2,4,6-TCP into other products [34]. Herein, both oxidative free radicals (·OH, O2 − and 1O2) and reduction radicals (·H and eaq –) are short life active species which cannot migrate too far from the surface of the photocatalyst particles. On the other side, the surface of the photocatalyst is the most active area, no matter for the 2,4,6-TCP adsorption and degradation, the hydrogen production or the utilization of the UV light energy. Therefore, the much reduced water film thickness in the atomized droplet will conduce to the all reactions for pollutant removal and the hydrogen production."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, by introducing the ultrasonic atomization methods, the photocatalysts can achieve the dispersion of (mesoporous) photocatalyst which can avoid the agglomeration of the particles. More than that, it has a significant promotion on both photocatalytic hydrogen production and degradation of pollutants. On one side, the 2,4,6-TCP play a sacrificial agent role in promoting the photocatalytic hydrogen production, especially for the g-C3N4, the most obvious up to 6012 mmol g−1; On the other side, in the photocatalytic hydrogen production process, 2,4,6-TCP can be rapidly removed by three kinds of photocatalysts in atomized droplets within 30 min, much more efficiency that in the solution. Another finding is, with the increase of catalyst concentration, the total hydrogen production immediately inhibited might due to the agglomeration of photocatalyst particles and light shielding. The proposed mechanism for hydrogen production by photocatalytic degradation of 2,4,6-TCP in atomized droplets was proposed. We believe that the thin water film surrounding the photocatalyst particles in the atomized droplet will shorten the pollutant and free radicals transfer distance, and maximize the utilization of UV light, and sequentially facilitate to the pollutant removal and the hydrogen production."
