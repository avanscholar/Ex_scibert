0,Introduction,"Chitosan-based membranes are polymeric materials that are being actively studied in the replacement of Nafion membranes for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In general, chitosan (CS) is an abundant natural polymer derived from the deacetylation of chitin. It has characteristics such as biodegradability, nontoxicity, and adsorption [1,2]. Despite having accountable characteristics, neat CS possesses some shortcomings including high solubility in acid environment, weak mechanical property, brittle and have high water-holding capacity that limits its application as a candidate of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) [3,4]. For that, one promising solution to overcome the limitations is by polymer blending with CS to increase the interfacial bonding between the polymers which can improve the mechanical properties [5]. The polymer blending involves the addition of polymers to transform CS into derivatives or composites [6]. In the CS polymer, it contains of NH2 group that features as a versatile unit to allow modification under mild conditions. By means of simple solution casting method, the chain initiation between polymer-polymer interactions are introduced through the physical mixing of dissolved polymers in its respective electrolyte solutions. The –NH2 or –OH groups in the CS are responsible to produce the macroradicals that led to the chain reactions on formation of composite [7]. As an example, Hu et al. [8] presented a novel composite membrane in acidified attapulgite (ATP)/CS. The composite membrane produced was observed with a significant improvement in the mechanical (tensile strength = 53.1 MPa, which was reported to be 22.7% higher than that of pure CS) and electrochemical properties (proton conductivity = 2.6 × 10−2 S/cm, which was reported to be 25.1% higher than that of pure CS at a temperature of 80 °C). One that received much attention is polymer blending with poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) owing to its low production cost, good physical and chemical properties and excellent film-forming ability characteristics [9–11]. The addition of PVA, a synthetic polymer is an appropriate counterpart to reduce the drawbacks of natural polymers. It possesses several advantages to the natural polymer after composite, which includes: (i) simplicity in chemical modifications to biologically derived natural polymers, and (ii) the ability to result in the alteration in the bulk composite properties [12]. According to Yang et al. [13], the prepared CS/PVA membrane showed improved mechanical strength and proton conductivity. This is in agreement with most of the studies, whereby the polymer blend of CS and PVA offers advantages of stability, biocompatibility, and mechanical strength relative to the properties of the single components [14–17]. Nevertheless, the CS/PVA composite membrane suffers from low proton conduction properties that are inherited from the parent polymer. The IEC value and ionic conductivity reported by Garcia-Cruz et al. [18] were 0.253 mequiv/g and 0.15–0.29 mS/cm, respectively. This issue was also raised by Ye et al. [19] for a pure PVA membrane, in which they referred to the absence of negatively charged ions to support proton transportation. A study conducted by Ambili et al. [20] reported that chemical crosslinking via sulfonation can convert the hydroxyl group in PVA to a sulfonate group, which will conduct protons. The group prepared varying ratios of CS/sulfonated PVA (CS/SPVA) composite membranes to study their properties towards direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) operation. The differences in the polymer ratio are expected to play a role in manipulating the homogeneity of the blend composite, which subsequently affects the proton conduction properties. In our previous study, the same design of approaches was adopted by using sulfosuccinic acid (SSA) as the sulfonate group that contributes to proton transport in the membrane [21]. This work was conducted by synthesizing a CS/SPVA composite membrane under a simple solution casting method and subsequently subjecting the membrane to heat treatment at varying compositions of CS/SPVA from 5:95 to 25:75. The results demonstrated that CS/SPVA with a ratio of 15:85 vol%/vol% yielded the optimum results of proton conductivity and water uptake, 7.33 mS/cm and 215.9%, respectively. These two parameters are crucial in evaluating membrane performance and hydrolytic stability for fuel cell applications. Nonetheless, there are opinions on the need to understand the miscibility between two polymers while conveying strong evidence of polymer-polymer interactions [22–24]. Based on Jawalkar et al. [22], the miscibility of CS and PVA can be confirmed through the calculation of the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter χ via molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The use of MD simulations eases the difficulty of studying the properties of bulk polymers while delivering some important properties (i.e., miscibility of polymer blends) with greater accuracy [25]. A range of CS compositions were simulated, and the results demonstrated that CS/PVA was immiscible up to 50 wt % of CS. In the case of the CS/SPVA composite membrane, the lack of data supporting miscibility is an issue. The involvement of chemical crosslinking influences the tendency to form miscible polymer blends, as the crosslinking effect could lead to an increase in molar mass that is unfavourable for polymer-polymer miscibility [26]. Generally, computational studies include a wide range of simulation models including molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, density functional theory (DFT), machine learning (ML) and random forest with Gaussian process model (RF-GP) [27–32]. Among all the simulation models, MD simulations reserve as a promising analytical tool used to describe the detailed information at atomistic level and femtosecond scale [33]. Besides that, the simulation protocol of a polymer atomistic model which relies on the force fields is beneficial in understanding the bonded and non-bonded interaction between all atom types in the systems [34]. Therefore, using MD simulations to extract and analyse the different transport contributions to the overall complex dynamics of the CS/SPVA composite membrane is beneficial [35]. The proton transport mechanism could be postulated from the study of the dynamic properties of hydronium ions, H3O+, and intermolecular pair correlation functions by the calculation of the mean square displacement (MSD) and radial distribution functions (RDFs). Thus far, there has yet to be any work studying the physical and proton transport properties of CS/SPVA composite membranes via MD simulations, despite extensive experimental work. Hence, the objective of this work is to carry out an MD simulation approach to study the physical and proton transport properties of CS/SPVA composite membranes and to validate the simulation results with experimental work. The success in validating the experimental work via simulations would shed new light, enabling us to further improve the properties of composite membranes through further modification of the composite membrane via computational methods prior to materialization in the laboratory."
1,Computational details,"In this study, the polymer structure is constructed and simulated with Accelrys commercial software (Materials Studio 2017). The ab initio parameterised Class II Condensed-phase Optimized Molecular Potential for Atomistic Simulation Studies (COMPASS) force field is used throughout the simulation by following the functional below [36]: (1) E = Ebond + Eangle + Eoop + Etorsion + Ecross + Eelec + ELJ, where E bond , E angle , E oop , E torsion , E cross , E elec , and E LJ represent the contributions of bond stretching, angle bending, out-of-plane angle coordinates, torsion, cross coupling, and electrostatic and van der Waals interactions, respectively. The COMPASS force field is primarily used to evaluate interatomic interactions, while applications of materials such as crystals, polymers, and inorganic materials have been widely studied. Herewith, an amorphous builder module is used to construct a simulation box packed with a polymer system under three-dimensional (3D) periodic boundary conditions. For the study of interatomic interactions in the boundary cell, geometry optimization and MD are analysed with the Forcite module. The MD simulation is conducted using isothermal-isochoric (NVT) or isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensembles at different equilibration steps [37]. Since the sulfonation of SSA on the PVA matrix can take place in a random order, different combinations of possibilities can arise via chemical reactions, including the formation of unreacted SSA, SSA grafted onto PVA, and crosslinked SSA/PVA interactions [38]. Therefore, we assumed the formation of crosslinked PVA upon sulfonation (as shown in Fig. 1 , with five repeating units of PVA monomers acting as a single chain) to simplify the simulation factors. Such a model is based on the sulfonation degree achieved upon chemical crosslinking to PVA obtained from experimental work [21]. Aside from that, the PVA model used in this work is pristine which serves the interest in studying the key interaction between the key functional groups responsible in the interaction with the polymer and proton ions. Before the construction of the polymer model, the individual polymer chain length of both chitosan and SPVA must be determined. Both chitosan and SPVA are constructed, and then, geometry optimization (at an iteration of 1000) is performed via the calculation of the minimum energy with the conjugate gradient (CG) method. The CG energy minimization approach utilizes the Polak-Ribiere algorithm with a convergence level of 0.001 kcal/mol/Å [22]. Upon acquiring the final structure, an MD simulation is performed to obtain the solubility parameter δ. The relationship between solubility and the number of repeating units is plotted to determine the adequate number of repeating units for simulation. To ensure that the constructed system is fully optimized, four different amorphous cells are created, and geometry minimization is performed to find the lowest energy conformations. The amorphous cell is created with a low initial density of 0.6 g/cm3 to prevent the ring catenation phenomenon, which is due to chain rigidity and stiffness [39]. Then, the conformation with the low potential energy structure is selected for relaxation by performing an MD simulation for 500 ps with an NPT ensemble at a temperature of 500 K and an integration step of 1 fs [39,40]. To certify that the system has approached an equilibrium state, the potential energy of the amorphous cell is monitored until a stable energy curve is obtained. The Coulombic and van der Waals interactions are calculated using the Ewald and atom-based summation, respectively. A convergence level of 0.001 kcal/(mol Å) is applied with an atom-based cut-off of 12.5 Å and spline/buffer widths of 1/0.5 Å. The Berendsen thermostat and barostat are applied to control temperature and pressure with a decay constant of 0.1 ps throughout the simulation [33]."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Miscibility of SPVA and CS,"3.1 Miscibility of SPVA and CS Prior to the construction of the 3D amorphous cell, the minimum molecular sizes of SPVA and CS are determined individually. Polymer chains with different lengths are generated to tabulate their corresponding solubility parameter while plotting a graph of the solubility parameter δ against the number of repeating units, as shown in Fig. 2 . The figure shows the minimum polymer chains involved in the representation of the actual polymer system. Choosing the minimum polymer chains would reduce the simulation time and cost. In practice, a solubility parameter that approaches a constant value, even at longer polymer molecular chains, is considered the representative length for modelling purposes [23]. In the case of SPVA, a small deviation is observed as the polymer molecular weight increases, and it is eventually saturated beyond 23 repeating units of SPVA. On the other hand, the solubility parameter curve of CS was observed with no change beyond 24 repeating units. Although the minimum number of repeating units could effectively represent the actual polymer system, the amorphous cell required a certain degree of polymerization to form a close-packed structure. In addition, the amorphous cell of the polymer blend was also required to achieve a weight ratio of 15:85 (CS:SPVA), which was reported as the best composition in terms of proton conduction properties [21]. Hence, SPVA and chitosan consisting of 24 and 40 repeating units, respectively, are used in this study to save computational time while maintaining computational reliability. Furthermore, an amorphous cell with a weight ratio of 15:85 (CS:SPVA) was constructed with 1 CS chain and 3 SPVA chains, as illustrated in Fig. 3 . To examine the compatibility behaviours between chitosan and SPVA, the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter χ is computed by (2) χ = zΔEmixRT, where z is a coordination number, whose value is taken as 6 for a cubic lattice model [22]. In addition, R and T represent the molar gas constant and absolute temperature of the simulation, respectively. The term ΔE mix is defined as the energy of mixing, which is the product summation of CED (the identity of CED is given by CED = E coh /V, where E coh is the cohesive energy, and V is the volume; it describes the energy required to completely vaporize 1 ml of a liquid and overcome the intermolecular forces between molecules, while in the case of the polymer, this is directed towards the solvent-polymer interactions [41]) and the volume fractions φ of the pure polymers and composite blend, as follows (3) ΔEmix = φA(EcohV)A+φB(EcohV)B-(EcohV)mix, where the subscript indicates the polymer species. Furthermore, the miscibility behaviour of the composite blend is expressed by the critical value of χ, which is shown as follows: (4) χcritical = 121 mA +1mB2, where m A and m B represent the degree of polymerization (actual number of repeating units) of polymer species A and B. According to the literature [42], the blend is considered to be miscible if the computed χ parameter is satisfied with the condition χ < χ critical . In contrast, the blend will be completely immiscible if the χ parameter is larger than χ critical . However, there is a given exemption where two phases coexist in the system when χ is slightly greater than the critical value [23,25]. Note that the solubility parameter is described by the square root of CED, which is defined by the amount of energy per unit volume required to overcome the intermolecular attraction between the molecules in the solvent [43]. Such a parameter can be applied for the calculation of the mixing energy ΔE mix (refer to Eq. (3)), which is referred to as the necessary amount of energy to support the formation of a homogeneous mixture. Then, the estimation of the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter χ (refer to Eq. (2)) can be obtained by using the energy of mixing to evaluate the miscibility of the blend. A boundary line that expresses the miscibility of the blend is computed to be χ critical = 0.0311. Based on the Flory-Huggins theory, χ can either be positive or negative, while the factor deciding miscibility is χ < χ critical . This expression is satisfied for CS/SPVA15 when χ = 0.00021 (see Table 1 ), which indicates the miscibility of these blends, as illustrated in Fig. 4 ."
4,Glass transition temperature,"3.2 Glass transition temperature Moving onto the study of the thermodynamic properties of the polymer system, the glass transition temperature, T g , is one of the most important properties because it determines the polymer processing and working temperature range [44]. In MD simulations, there are varying methods that can be used to compute the T g of polymers. An NPT ensemble is one of the most common approaches used to study the glass-rubber transition state via changes in volume as a function of temperature. The changes in volume is a result of dramatic change in the mobility of polymer chains with temperature. As temperature transit from T g to lower value, the polymer will undergo transformation from soft and rubbery to glassy, rigid and brittle form [45], in which it is crucial for the membrane to operate under this temperature to ensure film's dimensional stability. A constant-NPT MD simulation is performed over a range of temperatures above and below the glass transition temperature, T g , to model the glass-rubber transition state of the polymer system. Experimentally, the T g of the CS/SPVA15-SSA composite system is 421 K according to differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. Hence, a series of constant-NPT MD simulations is performed from 300 K to 500 K by an interval of 10 K (200 ps each) to predict the T g value. According to Klahn et al. [37], the heating cycle was preferred over cooling due to the challenges involved in generating realistic compact polymer structures, particularly at lower temperatures. However, the thermodynamic behaviour of the polymer structure is remarkably complex, and thus, we embraced the average T g value obtained from both heating and cooling cycles. Note that MD simulations are continued by using the final state obtained from the last simulation trajectory. According to the simulation trajectory obtained from the constant-NPT MD simulation, the volume V and density ρ at varying temperatures are computed. Therefore, graphs of volume versus the changes in temperature are plotted in Fig. 5 to find the T g value from the change in slope [46]. The data are fitted with two lines that indicate the data before and after the T g . The intersection point of the two lines suggests the T g value of the polymer system in which phase change has occurred at the representative temperature. As the temperature increases above T g (rubbery state), the polymer system displays a larger increase in volume, as presented in Fig. 5. This is in agreement with Yang et al.‘s [47] interpretation, whereby the polymer molecules experienced disentanglement when they attained a glass transition, thus resulting in an increase in thermal expansion. The T g values simulated for different systems, along with literature data, are summarized in Table 2 . According to the data tabulated, the T g of CS/SPVA15 is observed with a higher shift in temperature, which supports the crosslinking mechanism between SPVA and CS. This further proves that the miscibility between the two polymers expresses a strong polymer-polymer interaction, and thus, it disturbs the chain mobility and vice versa [48]. The simulated T g well matches the literature data with an error of approximately 5%. In addition, such results also indicate that (1) the constructed SPVA molecular structure is embraced with a certain degree of reliability, and (2) the CS/SPVA15 polymer system is capable of remaining stable up to a temperature of 430 K (the general operating temperature in a fuel cell is reported to be 353 K)."
5,Proton conductivity,"3.3 Proton conductivity To evaluate the proton conductivity of the polymer system, the ability of hydrated H3O+ diffusion is considered [51]. Such mobility is essential to act as a quantitative indicator for determining the proton conductivity of the polymer system. The mobility is analysed by calculating the MSD during simulations. An amorphous cell that consists of SPVA, chitosan, water molecules, and hydronium ions is constructed, and its composition is summarized in Table 3 . To compare the results with those of experimental studies and the literature, our present models are applied to mimic the experimental environment of the polymer system. The composition of water molecules in the amorphous system is specified by the following formula, which yields a figure of approximately four molecule units in this study [52]: (5) λ = WUIEC × Mwater where λ, WU, IEC, and M water denote the ratio of the mole number of water molecules to the fixed-charge sulfonate groups, water uptake, ion exchange capacity, and the molecular weight of water, respectively. Notably, WU and IEC were obtained from our previous study by means of experimental values [14]. The amorphous cells are minimized and relaxed via geometry optimization. Upon completing the MD simulation, the MSD of hydronium ions is calculated by the following formula: (6) M S D = [ R ( t ) − R ( 0 ) ] 2 where the term N is the number of diffusing particles, t is the diffusion time, and R i (t) is the position vector of particle i at time t. Then, diffusion coefficient D is defined as the diffusivity of the transported hydronium ions, which is given by the following equation: (7) D = lim t → ∞ [ R ( t ) − R ( 0 ) ] 2 6 t Note that this regime is valid only when the motion of the diffusing particle follows a random walk (i.e., its motion is not correlated with that at any previous time), which is in agreement with Einstein diffusion [53]. Then, the diffusivity of hydronium ions calculated from Eq. (7) is used to determine the ion conductivity σ using the following Einstein equation [51,54,55]: (8) σ = N z 2 e 2 D V k T where e, V, k, T, and z are the elemental charge, volume of the simulation cell, Boltzmann constant (k = 1.38 × 10−23 JK−1), absolute temperature, and total charge in units of e, respectively. To imitate the realistic working environment, MSD curves are obtained at a temperature of 353 K, as illustrated in Fig. 6 . The computed MSD curves are approximately linear, which indicates the constant diffusing movement of hydronium ions in the polymer matrix. Accordingly, the diffusion coefficients are calculated based on the linear regime of MSD curves and tabulated in Table 4 . The proton conductivities of the simulation and experiments for the SPVA membrane are not very different from each other at a temperature of 353 K (according to the results tabulated in Table 4), indicating that the sulfonate groups in the PVA is the key proton transport sites in the PVA polymer system. Meanwhile, the proton conductivity of the CS/SPVA15 polymer system is higher than that of the SPVA system, with a value of 11.15 mS/cm. However, the experimental results show otherwise (the proton conductivity of SPVA is slightly higher than that of the CS/SPVA15 composite polymer, with a value of 7.35 mS/cm to 7.33 mS/cm), which may be attributed to the excessive crosslinked bonds in the CS/SPVA15 polymer system. This is an obstacle, blocking the diffusion path of H3O+ along the polymer backbone [55]. The possible entanglement of polymer that results in different polymer arrangement with the experimental model could be another common consensus in obtaining the lower experimental value, as agree with other works [56,57]. On the other hand, the simulation result demonstrates an ideal environment whereby a minimum number of factors have been involved through the calculation of proton conductivity. Furthermore, a series of MD simulations is performed in the temperature range of 298 K–353 K to study the effect of temperature on proton transfer in the CS/SPVA composite membrane. Such results provide an accurate value of the activation energy E A of diffusion with the use of the Arrhenius equation, which is written as follows [58]: (9) σ = σ o exp [ − E A R T ] The Arrhenius plot of ln σ versus 1000/T for CS/SPVA15 is shown in Fig. 7 , where the slope of linear fitting for hydronium ions gives the expression–E A /R. The activation energy E A of diffusion can be considered a possible proton transport mechanism for the hydronium ions in the CS/SPVA15 polymer model. It defines the energy required for proton hopping or the free energy barrier that a proton overcomes in a successful hop between sites [59]. In general, proton diffusion mainly occurs by two mechanisms, namely, the Grotthuss mechanism (the free proton mechanism) and vehicle-facilitated mechanism (proton diffusion through the medium together with a ‘vehicle’, water) [60,61]. Fig. 7 shows that the operating temperature plays a significant role in the diffusion of protons in the CS/SPVA15 membrane. A linear regime of proton conductivity is obtained with respect to temperature. According to Seo et al. [62], the higher temperature has prompted an improvement in both proton diffusion and molecular diffusion for the polymer system. Subsequently, an improvement in proton conductivity is obtained from the higher diffusion coefficient of hydrated ions. The model yields an E A value of 13.9 kJ/mol for proton diffusion, which is in agreement with the experimental results of 12.7 kJ/mol (less than 15 kJ/mol for the Grotthuss-type mechanism) [21,63]. Hence, the Grotthuss-type proton transfer mechanism together with the relay transport mechanism with classical H3O+ motion can be applied to this model [64]."
6,Radial distribution functions,"3.4 Radial distribution functions The RDFs provide information regarding the interactions among different atoms, such as sulfonate groups, hydronium ions, and water molecules, in hydrated polymer membrane systems [65]. The RDFs are calculated by the following equation: (10) g A … B ( r ) = V N B · n B 4 π r 2 d r where g A … B (r), V, N B, and n A … B represent the pair correlation function between A and B, the volume of the cell, the total number of B particles in the system, and the number of A particles coordinated with particle B within a radius r, respectively. According to Sun et al. [66], RDFs were used to study the proton carrier and its fortified point in Nafion 117. Hence, a similar strategy is applied to elucidate the transfer of hydrated protons in the CS/SPVA15 membrane. Fig. 8 portrays the effects of temperature on the structures of all mobile groups in the CS/SPVA15 membrane. Note that λ is set at four throughout the simulation by the changes in cell temperature to accommodate a constant hydration level of the polymer system. In this figure, the oxygen atom in the free water molecule, the oxygen atom in the hydrated ion, the hydrogen atom in the free water molecule, the hydrogen atom in the hydrated ion and the sulfur atom are denoted as O2, O3, H2, H3, and S, respectively. Based on the results obtained, the RDFs of O2–O3, O3–H2, and S–O3 are nearly unchanged as the temperature increases. Such a result can be explained by the greater stability of the O2–O3, O3–H2, O3–H3 and S–O3 pairs of particles, whereby the strong internal binding force could contain them within their respective groups while keeping the moving scopes of these particles at a consistent distance [66,67]. On the other hand, the O2–O2 pair displayed an increase in distance due to the driving force of the elevated temperature that accelerates the movement of the water molecule and causes the enlargement in the moving fields, which subsequently increases the distance between two adjacent particles. As it stands, the temperature barely affects the distance of O3–H3. The formation of H+(H2O) n is not prominent, as demonstrated by Sun et al. [66], where the maximum RDF value of O3–H3 presents an increase that indicate the dominant formation of H+(H2O) n instead of H3O+. Hence, proton diffusion can be promoted by higher temperatures in the form of H3O+ to enhance proton conductivity. This agrees with the proposed Grotthuss-type proton transfer mechanism, where protons diffuse through the hydrogen bonding networks between hydronium ions and water in the dominant form of H3O+ [68]."
7,Mechanical properties,"3.5 Mechanical properties One of the objectives of obtaining polymer blends of SPVA and CS is to improve the overall mechanical properties. Here, the mechanical properties are estimated based on the generalized Hooke's law in the Voigt notation as (11) σ i = C i j ε j . ( i , j = 1,2 , .....6 ) where σ i is stress with six components, C ij is a 6 × 6 elastic coefficient matrix with C ij = C ji due to the quadratic form of strain energy, and ε j is the strain with six components [69]. The elastic coefficient matrix is computed for the whole computational cell, as shown in Table 5 , to elucidate the properties of the CS/SPVA15 membrane. From Table 5, it can be observed that several parameters are considerably small, and thus, we make an assumption by regarding the polymer system as an orthorhombic crystal system. Hence, the compliance matrix S in Voigt notation is defined as (12) ε i = S i j σ j The mechanical properties (i.e., Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio) of the polymer system can be obtained with the expression of compliance matrix S with an orthorhombic form, which is shown as follows. (13) S = [ 1 E x − v y x E y − v z x E z 0 0 0 − v x y E x 1 E y − v z y E z 0 0 0 − v x z E x − v y z E y 1 E z 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 G y z 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 G z x 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 G x y ] The mechanical properties of the SPVA and CS/SPVA15 membranes are presented in Table 6 . The CS/SPVA15 membrane exhibits an improvement in mechanical properties compared to the SPVA membrane. In general, the stiffness of the polymer is gauged by Young's modulus E i (i = x, y, z). Table 6 shows that the average Young's modulus E increases by approximately 110.1% from 0.79 to 1.66 GPa. The Young's modulus of the SPVA membrane is reported to be relatively similar to the results obtained from the tensile test of 0.62 GPa [70]. This expresses a strong correlation between the simulation results and experimental work, whereby the simulated value emerges with insignificant differences. In addition, the average computed Poisson's ratio v ranges from 0.1 to 0.4, which falls under the range of reinforced thermoplastics [71]. This figure is generally lower than that of a normal polymer (that of natural rubber is v ≈ 0.5), which may be due to the addition of PVA, a thermoplastic material. The elastic coefficient matrix of the polymer was originally considered an anisotropic material, and thus, Young's modulus, E i, and Poisson's ratio, v i , were calculated via Eq. (13). Under the assumption of isotropy for simply understanding the obtained properties, two independent Lamé coefficients, λ, and μ, are used to determine the stress-strain behaviour [72]. The shear modulus, G*(=μ) and bulk modulus, K*, are determined using the averaged Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio in Table 6 as follows: (14) G ∗ = μ = E 2 ( 1 + v ) (15) K ∗ = 3 λ + 2 μ 3 = E 3 ( 1 − 2 v ) The shear modulus G* measures the resistance ability to shear deformation. Here, the CS/SPVA15 membrane demonstrates a shear modulus of 0.958 GPa as opposed to 0.445 GPa in the SPVA membrane. This result indicated that the CS/SPVA15 membrane is more rigid and requires a larger shear force to produce deformation. For the bulk modulus, K*, which is defined by the measurement of the resistance ability to volume change [73], the mixed polymer system has a higher value of 97.1% than the SPVA membrane, reflecting a much more compact polymer structure. In summary, the strong physical crosslinking between SPVA and CS enhances the rigidity and resistance towards elastic deformation. The simulation results in terms of mechanical properties were superior for the CS/SPVA15 membrane, which acknowledges the purpose of performing polymer blending. Although polymer swelling yield greater proton conductivity in general (hydrophilic domains of the membrane swell in size and form an interconnected network of proton conducting channels [74]), dimensional stability remains one of the important features for the development of SPE to prevent the potential of mechanical failure and fuel crossover during fuel cell operation [75]. The much more rigid and compact structure of CS/SPVA15 could prove vital for improving the dimensional stability."
8,Conclusions,"In this research, amorphous cells of SPVA and CS/SPVA15 polymer systems are constructed to study proton conduction and mechanical properties. Prior to the investigation, the miscibility of the polymer blend in SPVA and CS was confirmed via a plot of the Flory-Huggins interaction (the χ value for CS/SPVA15 was below χ critical ). In addition, T g provided information regarding the working temperature of polymers. The simulated T g of 430 K suggests that the proposed polymer system remains stable at the working condition of 353 K, which is proven suitable for its potential in fuel cell applications. The proton conduction properties were quantified by the ability of hydronium ions to diffuse in the polymer matrix. With respect to the CS/SPVA15 membrane system, the increase in the simulated proton conductivity of 11.15 mS/cm in comparison to that of the SPVA membrane of 9.89 mS/cm is attributed to the higher MSD. However, the simulated results are higher than the experimental value of 7.33 mS/cm for the CS/SPVA15 composite membrane. However, the proton transfer mechanism is reported to be similar to the experimental mechanism, whereby proton transfer and transport are governed by the Grotthuss-type mechanism, which is supported by the Arrhenius plot and RDF study. For the mechanical properties, the average Young's modulus of 1.66 GPa of the CS/SPVA15 membrane system demonstrates an approximately 110% improvement compared that of 0.79 GPa for the SPVA single system."
