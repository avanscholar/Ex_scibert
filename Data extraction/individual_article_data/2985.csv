0,Introduction,"Dark fermentation does not require a lot of energy and can be operated at high rates in the absence of light input [1]. Hydrogen production through dark fermentation is controlled by environmental parameters such as temperature, pH, substrate concentration and iron concentration. Among these, temperature is one of the most profound, since it affects both activities of hydrogen producing bacteria and the fermentative production mechanism [2]. Controversial results have been reported on the effects of temperature on hydrogen fermentation. Wang and Wan (2008) [3] reported higher H2 yields by mesophiles (31.9 ml H2/h at 35 °C) than thermophiles (8.5 ml H2/h at 35 °C). On the other hand, Nazlina et al. (2009) [4] reported that biohydrogen production from food waste increased with increasing temperature. Generally, temperatures of 37 °C and 55 °C have been compared. Lee et al. (2008) [5] reported more H2 production at 37 °C (5.34 mmol H2/g-starch), whereas Zhang et al. (2003) [6] obtained higher H2 production yields at 55 °C (78 ml H2/g-starch). Koskinen et al. (2008) studied hot spring enrichments for hydrogen production in the temperature range of 37 °C–70 °C and reported 45 °C was optimal for H2 production (1.67 mol H2/mol glucose) [7]. Mäkinen et al. (2009) studied hydrogen production by a thermophilic strain, Thermovorax subterraneus, isolated from a geothermally active underground mine and reported that optimum temperature was 71 °C [8]. In this study, an intermediate temperature (45 °C) hot spring sample was used to enrich hydrogen producing mesophilic and thermophilic cultures. The effects of pH, glucose concentration and addition of iron and nickel on dark fermentative hydrogen production were studied at 37 °C and 55 °C. Furthermore, the effect of enrichment temperature on microbial communities was determined."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Enrichment of hot spring culture,"2.1 Enrichment of hot spring culture Two H2 producing cultures were enriched at 37 °C and 55 °C from a sediment sample collected from a geothermal hot spring located in Hisarkoy region in the Balıkesir province, Turkey. The water temperature of the sampling site was 45 °C. The pH of a natural hot spring is near neutral values [9]. Two ml of the sample sediment material was inoculated to serum bottles with 50 ml nutrient solution. Enrichments were incubated at 37 °C and 55 °C for 3 days and nutrient solution contained 9 g/l glucose with initial pH 6.8. During the enrichment, the presence of H2, CO2 and CH4 were monitored in biogas. After the second transfer, the cultures were used in the experiments."
3,Experimental procedure,"2.2 Experimental procedure Experiments were performed in 120 ml serum bottles with glucose. One liter of the nutrient solution contained NaHCO3, 4 g; NH4Cl, 0.6 g; NaH2PO4·H2O, 10.7 g; Na2HPO4, 3.2 g; K2HPO4·3H2O, 0.125; MgCl2·6H2O, 0.1 g; CaCl2.2H2O, 0.11 g and 0.5 g iron [10]. 0.5 g/l L-cysteine was used as a reducing agent. Two ml of the enriched culture, 48 ml nutrient solution supplemented with yeast extract (2 g/l) and glucose was added. Glucose concentration was kept constant at 9 g/l for all conditions while it was changed from 4.5 to 27 g/l to study the effect of substrate concentration. The pH of the growth medium was 6.8. Bottles were flushed with nitrogen for 5 min to provide anaerobic conditions, capped with rubber stoppers and placed in a shaker at 150 rpm. The experiments were carried out in duplicate. Effect of initial pH was investigated in the pH range of 5.5–8.0 with 9 g/l glucose. The pH of the media was adjusted using either 3 N HCl or NaOH. The effect of glucose concentration was studied in the range from 4.5 to 27 g/l. Effects of iron (Fe2+) and Nickel (Ni2+) on H2 production was studied by stepwise increase of their concentration from 0.5 to 200 mg/l using FeCl24H2O and NiCl26H2O chemicals. Hydrogen production was calculated as the moles of H2 produced per mole of glucose added and used to compare the effects of variables."
4,Analyses,"2.3 Analyses Syringe method was applied for measuring the volume of biogas produced. The composition of biogas was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2014) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and with Porapak N column (80/100 mesh). N2 was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. The temperatures of the injector, column and detector were 110 °C, 80 °C and 110 °C, respectively. End point glucose and soluble metabolites including acetate, butyrate, formate, lactate and alcohols were analyzed using a Shimadzu LC-20AD high-performance liquid chromatography with a Shodex Sugar SH1011 column (Showa Denko K.K., Tokyo, Japan) and a refractive index detector (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). 0.01 N H2SO4 was used as mobile phase. Final biomass concentration at end of the experiments was analyzed as Volatile Suspended Solid (VSSf) as described in Standard Methods [11]."
5,Molecular characterization of microbial diversity,"2.4 Molecular characterization of microbial diversity Microbial community analysis was performed using DNA extraction and PCR-DGGE (polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) of partial 16S rRNA genes followed by their sequencing. DNA was extracted from the samples using MOBIO Power Soil DNA Extraction kit (MOBIO Laboratories). Amplification of partial bacterial 16S rRNA genes of the community DNA, DGGE and analysis of sequence data were performed as previously described by Koskinen et al. (2007) [12]."
6,Kinetic modeling,"2.5 Kinetic modeling The modified Logistic equation was used for kinetic modeling of cumulative H2 production. The equation was as follows [13]: (1) C H = P 1 + exp [ 4 R m · ( λ − t ) / P + 2 ] Where, C H represents the cumulative volume of H2 hydrogen produced (ml), λ is the lag time (h), P is the H2 production potential (ml), R m is the maximum H2 production rate (ml/h). H2 production rate, r (ml/h), was calculated using Eq. (2) as follows: (2) r = P λ + P / R m Non-linear regression analysis was applied for kinetic modeling of experimental data. Modeling was carried out using solver add-in function of Microsoft Excel program."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Effect of initial pH,"3.1 Effect of initial pH Medium pH is one of the most important factors in hydrogen production affecting Fe-hydrogenase activity, metabolic pathways, and the duration of lag phase (Jo et al., 2008). In this study, the effect of initial pH on H2 production was investigated in the pH range from 5.0 to 8.0 and the results were as shown in Fig. 1 . No methane was detected in this or following experiments. No H2 was produced at pH 5.0 by either mesophilic or thermophilic cultures. At pH above 5.0, H2 was produced cumulatively for 28 h. H2 yield increased with the increase in initial pH. At 37 °C and pH 6.5 the highest H2 yield was 1.25 mol H2/mol glucose, while at 55 °C and pH 7.5 it was 1.0 mol H2/mol glucose. Similarly, Lin et al. (2006) reported the highest mesophilic H2 production at pH 6.5 [14]. The optimum pH with a thermophilic enrichment culture from Hisaralan hot spring was considerably different in our previous study where 1.52 mol H2/mol glucose was produced at pH 6.5, while no H2 was produced at pH 7.5 [10]. Initial pH and temperature had profound effects on cell growth and H2 content in biogas (Table 1 ). Final VSS concentrations were in the range from 0.54 to 1.23 g/l at 37 °C and from 0.51 to 0.70 g/l at 55 °C. Biomass concentrations at 37 °C were about two times higher than at 55 °C except at pH 5.0. H2 content in the biogas had similar profiles as H2 yields with highest hydrogen percentages of 36.2% and 32.4% at 37 and 55 °C, respectively. During fermentation, the pH gradually decreased due to the production of volatile fatty acids. The final pH values (Table 1) were also affected by the initial pH as previously reported [15]. Kinetic modeling was done using the modified Logistic equation, since it was recommended for describing hydrogen producing bacterial cultures [16]. Kinetic modeling gave an excellent correlation with experimental data (Table 1). According to experimental and kinetic modeling results, H2 production was optimal at the initial pH of pH 6.5 and pH 7.5 at 37 °C and 55 °C, respectively. Subsequent 37 and 55 °C incubations were performed at pH 6.5 and pH 7.5, respectively."
9,Effect of glucose concentration,"3.2 Effect of glucose concentration The effect of glucose concentration on H2 production and biomass was studied in the range from 4.5 to 27 g/l and the results were as shown in Fig. 2 and Table 2 . At 37 °C, cumulative H2 production and H2 yields increased with increasing glucose concentration from 4.5 to 9 g/l that had the highest H2 yield of 1.23 mol H2/mol glucose. At the same time, final VSS increased from 0.8 g/l to 1.40 g/l and cumulative H2 production potential increased from 3.13 to 8.23 ml H2/g glucose. Further increasing the glucose concentration decreased H2 yield while there were not major changes in cumulative H2 production, H2 content and kinetic parameters with glucose concentrations over 9 g/l. At 55 °C, the highest H2 yield and cumulative H2 production were obtained with 9 g/l glucose. Higher glucose concentration resulted in higher biomass concentration while H2 production rate decreased. The results indicated that H2 production at lower glucose concentration of 4.5 g/L was more favorable at 55 °C than at 37 °C. At 4.5 g/l glucose, the temperature increase from 37 to 55 °C increased H2 yield and H2 production rate from 0.2 to 0.71 mol H2/mol glucose and from 1.2 to 2.1 ml/h, respectively. However, at 37 °C, H2 yield, H2 production potential and H2 production rate were superior at higher glucose concentrations. Similar to prior pH experiments, higher microbial growth, H2 content, and lower final pH values were obtained at 37 °C. Both at 37 °C and 55 °C, the final pH values decreased with the increasing of glucose concentration due to the production of VFA's [6]."
10,Effect of iron,"3.3 Effect of iron Effect of iron on H2 production was investigated at optimum pH and with 9 g/l glucose. The basal medium contained 0.5 mg Fe2+/l and was stepwise increased up to 200 mg Fe2+/l and the results were as presented in Fig. 3 . Iron addition had similar effect on mesophilic and thermophilic H2 production. Increasing iron concentration from 0.5 to 25 mg/l increased the H2 yield and H2 content in the biogas both at 37 °C and 55 C. H2 production decreased from 1.7 to 1.6 mol H2/mol glucose at 37 °C and from 0.95 to 0.80 mol H2/mol glucose at 55 °C with the increasing of iron concentration up to 50 mg/l. No significant changes were seen at higher iron concentrations. Growth and iron concentrations did not correlate. Similarly, kinetic parameters fluctuated and final pH values were close to each other at all iron concentrations (Table 3 ). Furthermore, higher H2 yield, biomass concentration and H2 production rate were obtained at 37 °C than at 55 °C."
11,Effect of nickel,"3.4 Effect of nickel The influence of nickel concentration (from 0.02 to 200 mg/l) on H2 production and growth was studied (Fig. 4 ). Increasing Ni2+ concentration to 25 mg/l improved H2 yield both at 37 °C and 55 °C. Further increasing of nickel concentration inhibited H2 production at both 37 and 55 °C. H2 yield decreased at 50 mg Ni2+/l and H2 production stopped at 100 mg Ni2+/l and 200 mg Ni2+/l at 55 °C and at 37 °C, respectively. Both at 37 °C and 55 °C, biomass growth increased slightly up to 50 mg Ni2+/l while the growth was inhibited at higher concentrations. Final VSS results show that nickel inhibited more thermophiles since three times higher biomass was obtained at 37 °C (Table 4 ) while ratio of biomass concentration at 37 °C and 55 °C was about 2 in the previous experiments (Table 3). At elevated Ni2+ concentrations metabolite production was inhibited and the medium pH remained constant."
12,Soluble metabolites and H2 production mechanism,"3.5 Soluble metabolites and H2 production mechanism Distribution of soluble metabolites during the pH experiments was as shown in Fig. 5 . Production of the metabolites (Fig. 5) had similar profiles with H2 production (Fig. 1). The lag phase of soluble metabolites at 37 °C was longer than at 55 °C while lower amounts of metabolites were produced at 37 °C. One of the reasons for lower H2 production at 55 °C was associated with the direction of glucose metabolism to VFAs and ethanol instead of H2 production. The distribution of soluble metabolites was different at 37 °C and 55 °C. Formate, acetate and ethanol were the main products in both mesophilic and thermophilic cultures. Small amounts of butyrate and lactate were produced at 37 °C while they were not detected at 55 °C. Ethanol and acetate production pathways exist together with formate production during the ethanol type fermentation [17]. Further degradation of formate produces H2 and CO2 as described in Eq. (3) [18]. (3) C 6 H 12 O 6 + H 2 O → 2 H 2 + 2 CO 2 + C 2 H 4 O 2 + C 2 H 6 O In ethanol type fermentation H2 production decreases with increasing pH and formic acid concentration [17]. The profiles of the H2 and metabolites show that at 55 °C H2 was produced through ethanol type fermentation. At 37 °C, less formate and acetate was seen while H2 production increased with the production of butyrate. This was different from thermophilic H2 production. The increase in the H2 yield was likely related to the butyrate production. Similar results were reported by Hwang et al. (2004) [18]. H2 production through the acetate–butyrate type fermentation proceeds according to Eq. (4) [19]. (4) 3 C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 8 H 2 + 6 CO 2 + 2 C 2 H 4 O 2 + 2 C 4 H 8 O 2 Based on the distribution of soluble metabolites, H2 production at 37 °C was associated with the combination of ethanol and acetate–butyrate type fermentations. H2 production through butyrate type fermentation is dependent on pH [20]."
13,Microbial community analysis,"3.6 Microbial community analysis The DGGE band patterns of enrichment cultures at 37 and 55 °C were as shown in Fig. 6 and the closest relatives of the bands are listed in Table 5 . DGGE profiles of the two cultures show that microbial communities were affected by the enrichment temperature and changes in hydrogen yields and production mechanisms of cultures at 37 and 55 °C were linked to the bacterial community diversity. The enrichment temperature affected microbial communities and their diversity. Eight different bacterial species were present at 37 °C, while seven of them disappeared and Clostridium ramosum (band 8) dominated at 55 °C. The strains at both 37 °C and 55 °C were mostly related to Clostridium species which is typical hydrogen producing bacteria [12,21–24]. Clostridium butyricum (Bands 5 and 6) is very effective H2 producer [25]. Moreover, the butyrate production at 37 °C attributed to the presence of Clostridium butyricum [26]."
14,Conclusions,"Mesophilic and thermophilic hydrogen producing enrichment cultures were obtained from 45 °C Hisarkoy hot spring sample from Turkey. Highest growth and H2 production yields were at initial pH 6.5 and pH 7.5 at 37 °C and 55 °C, respectively. Mesophilic and thermophilic H2 production yield was highest with 9 g/l glucose, which also results in the highest bacterial growth. Iron and nickel addition up to 25 mg/l increased H2 production. Nickel at concentrations over 50 mg/l inhibited H2 production. Higher biomass concentration and H2 production yield were obtained at 37 °C than 55 °C. Differences between mesophilic and thermophilic H2 yields and production mechanisms were associated with changes in microbial community during enrichment. DGGE profiles indicated that both enrichment cultures were dominated with Clostridium species and microbial diversity decreased with increasing enrichment temperature. Ethanol and acetate–butyrate type fermentations shift to ethanol type fermentation when temperature is increased from 37 °C to 55 °C."
