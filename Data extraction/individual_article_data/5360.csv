0,Introduction,"Transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) are preferred in many optoelectronic devices such as touch screens [1–3] and LEDs [4–7]. Also, TCOs are used as an electrode or transport layer in various types of solar cells [8–12]. The TCO film to be used as a front electrode should be conductive as metals and completely transparent in a wide wavelength range in the ideal case but for the practical case, there is always a need for optimization between transparency and conductivity [13]. Various compounds including indium oxide (In2O3), tin oxide (SnO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), titanium oxide (TiO2), cadmium oxide (CdO), and their combinations such as indium tin oxide (ITO), aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO), fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), and gallium-doped zinc oxide (GZO) are used as TCO in industrial and laboratory scale applications [14,15]. Among these, ITO is the most commonly used transparent conductive electrode since it shows low sheet resistance (<200 Ω/sq) and high optical transmittance (>80%) in the visible region [16] owing to its wide bandgap more than 3.75 eV [17]. On the other hand, brittleness of the ITO films causes some disadvantages such as limiting the flexibility of the optoelectronic device and formation of micro-cracks which decreases the conductivity and the mechanical strength of the thin film [18]. In addition, indium sources are limited because it is a rare earth metal [19]. Nevertheless, the demand for ITO electrodes is still high and commercial ITO films mostly prepared by vacuum-based magnetron sputtering which is an effective technique to obtain low sheet resistance but causes a considerable increase in the production cost. It is very obvious that the optical and electrical properties of the ITO films should be enhanced by simple and cost-effective preparation techniques. Also, solution-based methods are advantageous for large-scale productions [20–22]. However, thin films produced by solution-based techniques mostly show lower conductivity compared to vacuum-based physical vapor deposition techniques [23]. At this point, the application of the post-treatment process after preparing thin films is very efficient especially in terms of electrical conductivity. In post-treatment processes, plasma [24,25] or reducing atmosphere [26] is used to provide an increase in the number of oxygen vacancies and the generated oxygen vacancies act as a source of free charge carriers resulting in an improvement in the conductivity. Although there are many studies that apply hydrogen post-treatment to TCO films [27–32], mostly only one parameter such as temperature or H2/Ar ratio was considered in each of these studies. Considering the post-treatment step is very critical, none of them examined the reduction conditions systematically. Therefore, this study aims to obtain ITO films with improved optical and electrical properties by the optimization of hydrogen post-treatment conditions. For this purpose, thin films firstly prepared by the spin coating technique and then subjected to the post-treatment process to decrease sheet resistance and increase surface homogeneity without causing any change in the optical transmittance and crystal structure."
1,Material and methods,
2,Preparation of ITO solution,"2.1 Preparation of ITO solution Anhydrous InCl3 (Alfa Asesar, 99.99%) powder was dissolved in acetylacetone with a concentration of 0.2 and 0.5 M by applying reflux at 85 °C for 1 h. SnCl2.2H2O (Merck, 98%) was dissolved in absolute ethanol and mixed at room temperature. Thereafter, indium and tin solutions were mixed in the ratio of 90:10 (In:Sn), another reflux was applied at 85 °C for 1 h to obtain ITO solution and the solution aged for 24 h."
3,Preparation of ITO films,"2.2 Preparation of ITO films Bare glass substrates (1.25 × 1.25 cm) were cleaned with ethanol, boiled deionized (DI) water, isopropyl alcohol, again DI water in the ultrasonic bath and UV-Ozone Cleaner for 10 min each, respectively. ITO solution was deposited onto bare glass with spin coating technique in two steps consisting of 500 rpm for 5 s and 3000 rpm for 40 s. During the preparation of thin films, deposition and drying at 200 °C for 5 min processes were repeated for each step. To achieve optimum thickness, different number of coatings (1, 3, 5, 7, 15) were applied to ITO films. Also, the effect of annealing temperature (450–650 °C) and annealing time (30–90 min) were analyzed for air medium."
4,Post-treatment with hydrogen,"2.3 Post-treatment with hydrogen The post-treatment process was carried out in the high-temperature furnace which has a connection to H2 and Ar flowmeters. Three main parameters for post-treatment including temperature (200, 300, 400 °C), time (1, 2, 3 h) and hydrogen concentration (5%, 10%, 15% H2 containing Ar medium) were investigated for the ITO films annealed at 600 °C for 30 min."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization Transmittance measurements of the thin films were performed at room temperature using a UV–visible Spectroscopy (Agilent 8453) within the range of 280–1100 nm wavelength. The sheet resistance of thin films was measured using a four-probe measurement set-up (Keithley 2400). The thickness of the thin films was determined by profilometer (Vecco, Dektak 150). Morphology and the homogeneity of the thin films were observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM, Quanta FEG 250). The structural characterization of the ITO films was carried out by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD) (Philips PW-3710) with CuKα radiation source (λ = 0.15406 nm) in the range of 20–90° with 0.02° step, 10 kV power. In addition to these, K-alpha X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Thermo Scientific, XPS) was used for the characterization of surface properties."
6,Results and discussion,"First of all, solution preparation and annealing conditions were optimized for ITO thin films. To investigate the effect of the concentration; 0.2 M and 0.5 M ITO solutions were prepared and coated onto bare glass substrates with a different number of coatings. Fig. 1 shows the effect of solution concentration and the number of coating in terms of sheet resistance. When the molarity of the solution was 0.2, the sheet resistance of the ITO films was measured as 125.3, 97.8, 75.3, 36.9 and 14.8 kΩ/sq for the deposition of 1, 3, 5, 7 and 15 times, respectively. As it is seen, the sheet resistance of the thin films decreased depending on the higher number of coatings. Therefore, the molarity of the solution was increased to 0.5 M to obtain lower sheet resistance with a lower number of deposition. For 0.5 M solution, the sheet resistance of ITO films was measured as 50.8, 7.5, 6.9, 2.35 and 6.9 kΩ/sq as the same number of coatings with 0.2 M ITO solution. The film thickness of the samples coated with 0.5 M solution 5 and 7 times was determined by profilometer as 105 and 120 nm, respectively. Considering the film thickness and sheet resistance 7 times deposition was chosen as the optimum number of coating. On the other hand, 15 times of deposition with 0.5 M solution caused an increase in the sheet resistance which is consistent with the studies in the literature. These studies explain that there is a strong correlation between the increased film thickness and formation of microcracks due to higher internal stress accumulating in the film which results in the formation of defects in the free carrier transport path [18,33–35]. In order to investigate the effect of time on the sheet resistance, ITO films were annealed for 30, 60 and 90 min at 500 °C. The sheet resistance measurements of these films were given in Table 1 . Considering the energy consumption, it was decided that it would be appropriate to anneal the ITO films for 30 min for further studies since the heat treatment time had very limited effect on the sheet resistance and yielded better results. Thereafter, ITO films prepared by 0.5 M solution with 7 times deposition were annealed in the range of 450–650 °C for 30 min to determine the optimum annealing temperature since it is one of the most important parameters for the formation of the crystal structure. Fig. 2 demonstrates the behavior of ITO films with temperature variation before post-treatment. As the annealing temperature increased from 450 °C to 600 °C, the sheet resistance decreased significantly and when the temperature was increased to 650 °C it tended to increase. The lowest sheet resistance was found as 0.86 kΩ/sq which was obtained by annealing at 600 °C for 30 min. Fig. 2 also shows the sheet resistance variation by applying post-treatment in 5% H2 containing Ar medium for ITO films annealed at different temperatures before systematically analyzing the effect of hydrogen reduction. Although the decrease in the sheet resistance after post-treatment was less sharp than before, it still maintained the same characteristic with a decrease up to 600 °C and an increase after this temperature. Post-treatment at 300 °C for 2 h in 5% H2 containing medium for the sample annealed at 600 °C, reduced the minimum sheet resistance down to 0.35 kΩ/sq. It was confirmed that the lowest sheet resistance can be achieved by using optimized as-prepared ITO film (spin coating 0.5 M solution for 7 times and annealing at 600 °C for 30 min) even after applying hydrogen reduction, the post-treatment process conditions were investigated systematically. The sheet resistance of the samples prepared with different post-treatment conditions was given in Table 2 . Here, the reduction represents the change in the sheet resistance of the samples before and after post-treatment by percentage. Considering the post-treatment duration, higher processing time increased the sheet resistance reduction for all samples and post-treatment for 3 h gave better results. It can be said that with respect to S3, S6, and S7 samples or S2, S4, and S5 samples, the most convenient post-reduction temperature was 300 °C. According to the sheet resistance decrease of S3, S8, and S9 samples, increasing H2 concentration up to 10%, increases the efficiency of the reduction process. This is because reducing medium led to the release of oxygen atoms closer to the surface and formation of oxygen vacancies. For further H2 concentration (15%), the efficiency of the reduction process decreased. For this reason, it can be said that there is an optimum value for the temperature and concentration of H2 in the medium. Fig. 3 shows the optical transmittance measurements before and after post-treatment. Transmittance values for all these samples (S1–S9) were measured between 80 and 92% and any difference was not observed after post-treatment. These results are similar to the studies using plasma treatment in the literature [24,36]. Fig. 4 shows the optical bandgap calculation based on the absorbance measurements of the ITO films before and after post-treatment. As it is known, there is a tradeoff between transparency and conductivity. Although the wide bandgap is correlated with the high optical transmittance, it makes the excitation of the electrons difficult. Therefore, it is important to obtain low sheet resistance without decreasing the optical transmittance. As seen in Fig. 4, the bandgap of the ITO films are 3.68 and 3.70 eV for as-prepared and post-treated samples, respectively. The results are also consistent with the literature, as the direct optical bandgap of the ITO films has been reported in the literature with a value between 3.4 and 4.3 eV [37]. A minor increase in the bandgap after post-treatment can be explained by the Moss-Burstein shift which can be attributed to the carrier concentration increment [38,39]. Herein, the post-treatment with hydrogen results in an improvement in the conductivity depending on the formation of oxygen vacancies acting as free charge carriers which will be also discussed in this paper. XRD patterns of ITO films annealed at 600 °C for 30 min (before post-treatment) and subjected to hydrogen reduction at 300 °C for 3 h with 10% H2 containing medium (after post-treatment) are shown in Fig. 5 . It can be seen that ITO featured the characteristics of a cubic structure according to 222 and 400 peaks [40]. The peak at 2θ = 27° in the before post-annealing XRD pattern indicates that some Sn atoms could not properly be incorporated into the In2O3 crystal structure. On the other hand, the post-treatment process enhanced the crystal structure because the intensity of this peak considerably decreased and the peak almost disappeared. The mean crystallite size (D) is calculated by the Scherer equation (Eq. (1)), where the constant K is 0.9 and h1/2 is the diffraction broadening of the peak at half-height for a Bragg’s angle θ with regard to dominant 222 peak as 15.5 nm and 22.4 nm for before and after post-treatment, respectively. Herein, post-treatment provided a growth in the crystal size. (1) D = K λ / h 1 / 2 cos θ SEM images of ITO films (Fig. 6 ) demonstrated that after post-treatment the particle distribution in the surface was homogeneous and the process provided distinct grain boundaries. XPS is a very sensitive quantitative technique to observe the contamination and the chemical composition in the surface. For this reason, the surface of the as-prepared (spin-coated and annealed at 600° for 30 min in air) and post-treated ITO films was investigated by XPS. The XPS survey scan of ITO films (Fig. 7 ) shows that the as-prepared film consists of In, Sn, and O. After post-treatment there was not observable peak shift in the XPS spectrum. Also, there was no detectable contamination except C 1s and the presence of graphitic/aromatic C 1s peak is due to surface contamination of samples before XPS measurements [41,42]. However, the peak intensity of this impurity is very low and thus the effect is negligible. Figs. 8 and 9 show the XPS spectra of ITO films before and after post-treatment. The position of the C 1s peak with the binding energy of 284.48 eV is taken as a reference in both Figs. 8c and 9c. In the Sn 3d spectra (Fig. 8a), two peaks were observed in 494.58 and 486.18 eV which corresponds to Sn 3d3/2 and Sn 3d5/2, respectively [43]. The peak at 486.18 eV corresponds to the Sn4+ bonding state arising from SnO2 [41] and the peak at 494.58 eV can be interpreted to metallic tin or can be contributed by both Sn4+ and Sn2+. SnO2 is thermodynamically more stable than SnO hence the Sn4+ is thought as the predominant state in the ITO films [43,44]. The binding energies of the In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2 peaks were at 444.58 and 451.68 eV, respectively (Fig. 8b). Prior studies have noted that the binding energy of In 3d5/2 at 444.58 eV can be attributed to the In3+ bonding state from In2O3 [45]. This is consistent with our XRD results of In2O3 crystal structure with the 222 characteristic peak at 2θ = 30°. Considering In and Sn peaks after post-treatment given in Fig. 9a and b, no significant difference was observed between as-prepared and post-treated ITO films. On the other hand, O 1s spectra of post-treated ITO (Fig. 9d) differs from as-prepared ITO (Fig. 8d) in a number of important ways. While the amount of oxygen bound to indium (In–O) at a binding energy of 529.68 eV has decreased dramatically, the amount of oxygen vacancies (Vo) at 531.38 eV and hydroxyl bonds arising from InOH3 (also known as chemisorbed oxygen) at 530.58 eV in the structure has increased after hydrogen post-treatment [24]. Also, H2O bonded to surface with the binding energy of 532.18 eV most likely caused by the humidity in the ambient. The atomic ratio variation of O 1s spectra before and after post-treatment is given in Fig. 10 . As seen in the figure, the most noticeable change in the surface was observed in the O2− and OH− groups and there was a slight increase in Vo. The interpreted mechanism of post-treatment is as following; energetic photon irradiation can lead to adsorption of hydrogen onto the ITO surface and heating induces lowering the activation barrier which enables the reaction between hydrogen provided from the gas supply and oxygen situated in the ITO structure. As a result of this reaction, the number of ionized oxygen vacancies and defect sites increase which allowing the excess electrons to release into the ITO film and correspondingly increasing the free carrier concentration [46]. Furthermore, during the post-treatment with hydrogen, the oxygen closer to the surface is effectively released out from the coating but it is difficult to form oxygen vacancies at a depth far from the film surface [23]. Therefore, post-treatment is a process that takes place on the surface of the film. In addition to these, oxygen ions (O2−) in the bixbyite In2O3 structure have an ionic radius of 1.38 Å which is more than that of OH− group with an ionic radius of 1.35 Å. For this reason, OH− is the most probable specie in the ITO film surface [47]. Considering all this information from literature, a possible explanation for post-treatment in our case might be that after the formation of oxygen vacancies, OH− groups which have a smaller ionic radius filled these vacancies which results in a slight change in the atomic ratio of Vo. Although the formation of oxygen vacancies is limited, applying post-treatment to ITO films in 10% H2 containing Ar medium at 300 °C for 3 h provided a major decrease (approximately 70%) in sheet resistance."
7,Conclusion,"In this study, the solution-based preparation of ITO films was performed and the optimum condition was found as annealing at 600 °C for 30 min for the 7 times coated ITO films prepared by 0.5 M precursor solution having the indium to tin ratio of 90:10. The sheet resistance of ITO films prepared in the given circumstances was measured as 0.86 kΩ/sq and the optical transmittance was 87.03%. To reduce the sheet resistance, hydrogen post-treatment mostly performed in an exact condition in the literature although it considerably affects the film properties. Therefore, the post-treatment process in terms of various parameters such as temperature, time and hydrogen concentration were investigated. The basic findings are consistent with research showing that increasing the post-treatment time affects hydrogen reduction yield positively and there is an optimum value for temperature and H2 concentration. The most efficient post-treatment condition was found as exposure of ITO films to 10% H2 containing Ar medium at 300 °C for 3 h which results in approximately 70% sheet resistance reduction. During the post-treatment, O2− ions removed from the surface of the ITO film and thereafter replaced with oxygen vacancies and hydroxyl groups. In addition, these findings provide additional information that hydrogen post-treatment enhances the film morphology and the electrical conductivity without changing the optical transmittance and the crystal structure."
