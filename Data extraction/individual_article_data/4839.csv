0,Introduction,"The enormous solar flux at the earth's surface depicts a unique capacity to deliver clean and renewable energy source for the sustainable future. In the recent era, solar to chemical fuel (hydrogen) conversion has drawn significant attention and has also given a promising solution for global energy and environmental crisis. Photocatalysis provides a major way for storing solar energy in chemical bonds that can efficiently capture sunlight and transform photon energy into chemical energy. Platinum-supported titanium catalysts have been widely used in various industrial procedures due to their excellent efficiency to accelerate the rate of reaction with very low price. In early 1970s, Fujishima and Honda reported water splitting and significant hydrogen generation by using TiO2 and Pt electrode in a photoelectrochemical cell (Fujishima and Honda, 1972). TiO2 (Titanium(VI)dioxide) has drawn extensive attention in photocatalysis and environmental remediation owing to its non-toxicity, stability, wide availability, durability, and low cost. Several disadvantages often restrict the traditional photocatalyst TiO2 for photocatalytic water splitting including (i) wide band gap (3.2 eV) and (ii) rapid charge recombination of photogenerated electron and hole pairs leading to low quantum yield and a poor photocatalytic activity (Asahi et al., 2001; Linsebigler et al., 1995; Chen et al., 2011). To generate hydrogen photocatalytically, extensive efforts are being made across the globe to overcome the above disadvantages and improve the performance of TiO2. The most promising and viable way to overcome the above problem is the incorporation of noble metal nanoparticles (mainly Pt) on TiO2. Platinum is one of the most promising noble metal and light harvesting cocatalyst for photocatalytic enhancement. Platinum exhibits highest Schottky barrier (Chen et al., 2007; Zielińska-Jurek and Zaleska, 2014) and therefore deposition of Pt on TiO2 creates an interface. This interface acts as an electron sink and reduces the chances of electron-hole pair recombination. Deposition of platinum (Pt) metal nanoparticle on TiO2 can absorb visible light and bring significant changes to many aspects of photocatalysis. An increase in activity of photocatalysis is observed when irradiated under visible light due to LSPR effect. Other photocatalysis materials like; MoS2/g-C3N4, Cu2O and CuInZnS nanoparticles have reported as highly photocatalytic performance (Ye et al., 2018; Haijun Huang et al., 2017; Wen al., 2016). This phenomenon occurs when nanoparticles with free electrons interact with an external electric field that matches with the valence electrons oscillating against the restoring force of nuclei (Zielińska-Jurek et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2013). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of platinum is relatively unexplored because Pt nanoparticles show SPR below 450 nm, which makes weak absorption of light (Anpo and Takeuchi, 2003; Amano et al., 2009). Gray et al. reported Pt loading on TiO2 nanotubes with improved photocatalytic activity in visible light for photo-oxidation of acetaldehyde (Bigall et al., 2008). Similarly, Al-Thabaiti et al. synthesized intrinsic decorated TiO2 nanotubes with Pt leading to highly efficient photocatalyst for hydrogen generation under both UV and visible light (Vijayan et al., 2010). Tian et al. reported selective oxidation of alcohol to aldehyde in water based on surface plasmon resonance of platinum nanoparticle loaded on TiO2 under visible light irradiation (Basahel et al., 2014). Li et al. explained deposition of Pt on TiO2 surface with highest activity for H2 generation (Zhai et al., 2011). There are many reports on effect of inorganic ions on photocatalytic degradation and activity of TiO2 has been discussed widely. In this study, TiO2 was modified by depositing Pt onto TiO2 surface by a traditional in-situ-photo deposition method using different illumination sources to understand its influence on photocatalytic hydrogen generation (Li et al., 2001). In this approach, TiO2 has filled VB (Valence Band) & unfilled CB (conduction band) in its electronic structure. When illuminated with photon energy (hv) electron and holes are generated in TiO2. Platinum precursor gets reduced to zerovalent Pt and gets deposited onto TiO2 surface in the presence of ethanol and water. The electrons from CB of TiO2 is trapped by platinum owing to the Schottky barrier created. Ethanol which is added as a sacrificial donor prevents recombination (Kowalska et al., 2009; Kowalska et al., 2012). Such in-situ decorated Pt metal and chloride formation on TiO2 shows valuable improvement in photocatalytic H2 generation rate under UV–Vis irradiation."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All chemicals were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. Aeroxide TiO2 (P-25) (80–20% anatase to rutile) procured from Evonik Degussa Corporation, U.S.A., was used as the catalyst. Ethanol (99.9%) was purchased from Merck. Hexachloroplatinate (IV) solution (50% assays) was purchased from Merck. Ultrapure water (18 MΩ cm) was used for sample preparation and experiment."
3,Synthesis and characterization of catalyst,"2.2 Synthesis and characterization of catalyst Platinum was deposited on TiO2 (Degussa-P25) catalyst by in-situ photo deposition method. TiO2 powder was mixed with a requisite volume of hexacholoroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) solution (consistent to 1% w/w loading), and ethanol was used as a sacrificial donor. A 20:1 volume ratio of de-ionized water and ethanol was added to the photocatalytic reactor. Then, the reaction mixture was illuminated under anaerobic condition (in presences of N2) by using a solar simulator (AM 1.5 G filter, 1 sun) and medium pressure mercury lamp (450 W) with vigorous stirring. The white color of solution transformed into a grey color. After centrifugation and washing with ethanol 2–3 times, the powder was dried at 60 °C temperature in a vacuum oven. The sample designated as Pt/TiO2 (in-situ). The same process as mentioned was carried out except recovered catalyst prior to testing the catalyst for hydrogen generation rate. p-XRD patterns of synthesized materials and crystallinity were determined using Rigaku Miniflex-II Desktop X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation and data were collected in a 2ϴ range. All materials were scanned with a step width of 10 min−1. pXRD recorded pattern were matched with a JCPDS cards. UV–Visible diffuse reflectance spectra were measured by using UV–vis/NIR Agilent spectrophotometer and the absorbance of all materials were analysed the same instrument. Transmission electron microscopy studies carried out on Phillips CM100 electron microscope operating at 100 kV."
4,Light source,"2.3 Light source All experiments were performed with either solar simulator or medium pressure mercury lamp. The simulated solar irradiation was produced using a solar simulator (1000-W Xe arc lamp with an AM 1.5 G filter). It generates simulated 1 sun intensity (100 mW cm−2) 500 W, which matches with the global solar spectrum. Medium pressure mercury lamp was used as a source of UV–visible light (450 W)."
5,Photocatalytic hydrogen generations,"2.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen generations All the experiments were carried out in gas-tight 750 mL borosilicate glass (outer chamber) with quartz inner illumination vessel. TiO2, 1% hexachloroplatinic acid solution, 400 mL deionized water, and 5% Ethanol were taken in an outer glass chamber. The reaction mixture was then degassed by using ultra-pure nitrogen for 25 min to remove all the dissolved gasses. The temperature of the reaction was maintained at room temperature by continuously circulating water through inner quartz vessel. The solution was stirred at 400 rpm. Photocatalyst was irradiated by 450 W medium pressure mercury lamp. The gas mixture was analysed by using online GC-2014 Shimadzu with molecular sieve 5A packed column and N2."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of catalyst (Pt/TiO2),"3.1 Characterization of catalyst (Pt/TiO2) XRD of bare TiO2 and Pt/TiO2, synthesized under the irradiation of medium pressure mercury lamp is presented in Fig. 1 . Similarly, the pXRD pattern of Pt/TiO2 and standard TiO2 is same regarding position and width (Ren et al., 2010) sharp peaks of Pt cannot be detected because its concentration appears to be below XRD detection limit. Another possibility could be due to lower loading and homogeneous dispersion. UV-DRS spectra of bare TiO2 (P-25) and Pt/TiO2 are shown in (Fig. 2 ). The incorporation of Pt metal on TiO2 matrix show a shift in the spectrum (Chowdhury et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2009). The peak for Pt/TiO2 shifted towards visible region leading to a reduction in the band gap of TiO2 from 3.04 eV to 2.38 eV (Red shift). The UV-DRS spectrum reveals the broadband absorption from (300 to 700 nm) of platinum nanoparticles onto TiO2 surface. The morphology and size distribution of metal nanoparticles on photocatalyst Pt/TiO2 was observed by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The TEM study of photocatalyst Pt/TiO2 indicates that Pt nanoparticles were reduced and homogeneously deposited on TiO2 surface. It is also confirmed from the color transformation from the white color of TiO2 to gray color in case of Pt/TiO2. Fig. 3 shows that Pt nanoparticles were deposited onto TiO2 matrix with average particle size of Pt nanoparticle is 10 nm on TiO2 surface. The sharper one at 25.80 indexed at (1 0 1) diffraction angle with interspacing distance of 0.36 nm belong to TiO2 (P-25) of anatase phase."
8,Effect of illumination source,"3.2 Effect of illumination source The effect of illumination source on reaction mixture was analysed by varying the source. The catalyst was illuminated by solar AM 1.5 and medium pressure mercury lamp. Experiments were also carried out in the presence and absence of illumination. In the absence of illumination, no hydrogen generation was observed by the catalyst. Fig. 3 show the hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of 0.107 mmol h−1 for Pt/TiO2 under Solar AM 1.5 G illuminations. The hydrogen evolution rate of Pt/TiO2 was observed to be 17 mmol h−1 under 450 W medium pressure mercury lamp; there is significant enhancement by a factor of 170 (Table 1 ) this is attributed to the presence of in-situ generated Cl− ion from [PtCl6 −] ions adsorbed on the TiO2 surface, facilitate photocatalytic water splitting reaction. We could observe that Cl− ion also influence the hydrogen generation rate. The hydrogen production activity of TiO2 (P-25) was obviously poor compare to the sample deposited with metal."
9,XPS of Pt/TiO2,"3.3 XPS of Pt/TiO2 To affirm the chemical state of Pt Np on the TiO2 surface was further investigated by (XPS) X-ray photon spectroscopy measurement. As it can be seen from XPS pattern (Fig. 4 A) of the survey spectrum, there are Pt 4f, Ti 2p, O 1s are present in the composite form. The Ti2p spectra (Fig. 4B) displays two symmetric peaks at 458.7 eV corresponds to Ti2p3/2 and another one 465.4 eV assigned to Ti2p1/2. The spin-orbital component between two peaks centred Ti2p3/2 and Ti2p1/2 is 5.8 eV, which indicates the Ti4+ state in TiO2 (Wang et al., 2009). The O1s spectra (Fig. 4C) can be fitted into two symmetric peaks located at 529.9 eV, and 530.0 eV can be assigned to TiO2 and H2O (Chem et al., 2011; An et al., 2007). The binding energy of Pt 4f spectra of Pt/TiO2 is situated at 70.7 eV and 74.1 eV as shown in Fig. 4D. Which suggesting the existence of Pt in metallic Pt0 state (Nagai et al., 2002)."
10,Effect of amount of Pt loading on TiO2 surface,"3.4 Effect of amount of Pt loading on TiO2 surface Photocatalytic hydrogen generation enhanced significantly with photodeposition of Pt metal on TiO2 surface. To investigate the effect of loading of Pt, on TiO2 the percent loading was 0% to 2.5% w/w. The hydrogen generation rate increased as loading increased from 0.097 mmol h−1 to 17 mmol h−1 (Fig. 5 ). Significant enhancement was observed up to 1% w/w loading after that an increase in loading up to 2.5% w/w had no impact on hydrogen evolution rate. It might be attributed to two reasons firstly, Pt loading concentration reached to maximum limit, which makes charge layer narrow, as result penetration of depth of illumination surpass space charge layer. This condition favourable for recombination reaction with consequent reduce Titania hydrogen generation rate (Han et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2002). Secondly, as we increased in Pt concentration the amount of in-situ chloride formation also increased. They form inorganic layer on catalyst surface after certain limit and inhibits the photocatalytic hydrogen generation (Krivec et al., 2014)."
11,Effect of ethanol (C2H5OH) volume variation,"3.5 Effect of ethanol (C2H5OH) volume variation The catalyst behaviour has been explored by kinetic measurement and photo reforming of ethanol. It has been observed that ethanol adsorption on the active surface of the catalyst evolves insignificant amount of hydrogen and stops the reaction due to self-positioning effect and exhaust catalyst. However, when catalyst is photo-irradiated it excites bandgap and creates an active oxygen (O−) species. This active O− species at the surface in the presence of water attack active site hole in the metal periphery and leaves the vacant site on the surface of metal (Bowker, 2011). The photocatalytic hydrogen generation rate is enhancing by varying sacrificial donor ethanol from 0% to 100%. It is observed from Fig. 6 a, the hydrogen evolution rate of 5% ethanol rate is close to another dose. As we increase ethanol percentage in the presence of water, it increases with dose but after few minutes comes down due to self-poisoning effect. Kinetic model explains hydrogen production because of redox reaction steps associated with scavenger (ethanol). Fig. 6b depicts the hydrogen generation also takes place through direct electron injection to H+. To evaluate kinetic rate of hydrogen generation, concentration of ethanol varied continuously. As proposed the direct photocatalytic reaction of photogenerated holes and sacrificial donor is possible only if ethanol is strongly absorbed on the surface of TiO2. Therefore, the rate of H2 generation varied with function of CO (ethanol) and absorbed ethanol concentration on the catalyst surface obtained by Langmuir-Hinshelwood equation represented as below (Fig. 7 ). The results are shows that the absorption co-efficient value decreased with increase in ethanol concentration. This present work we assumed that photogenerated photon, arising from ethanol as a sacrificial donor on the photocatalyst TiO2 surface, immediately creates active site on Pt nanoparticle and evolves hydrogen gas. r = d c d t = k K C 1 + K C"
12,Apparent quantum yield,"3.6 Apparent quantum yield The apparent quantum yield was calculated by using formula from previous reports (An et al., 2007). A p p a r e n t q u a n t u m y i e l d φ H 2 % = n u m b e r o f r e a c t e d e - o r h + n u m b e r o f t h e i n c i d e n t p h o t o n The monometallic Pt/TiO2 under UV–Vis illumination produced H2 more efficiently than solar AM 1.5 G illumination. The apparent quantum yield for both was 6.72% and 0.04% for UV–Visible and solar AM 1.5 illuminated systems respectively. A key point was photo-deposition of Pt nanoparticle on TiO2 matrix that affects electronic configuration and forms semiconductor-metal junction which facilitates high yield of H2 production."
13,Reaction mechanism,"3.7 Reaction mechanism Based on the observed results and discussion, a possible reason for enhanced reactivity of Pt/TiO2 has been proposed. Deposition of Pt nanoparticles on TiO2 under the influence of UV irradiation shows dominant charge separation mechanism (Wang et al., 2009). The photoexcited electron generated by TiO2 under UV illumination then transfers electron to Pt nanoparticle which in turn is used for reduction, thus exhibiting higher photocatalytic efficiency under UV light (Singh and Strouse, 2010; Chen and Murray, 1999) (Eqs. (1) and (2)). (1) TiO2 + hv → e− + h+ (2) Ptn + e− CB → Ptn − In the case of semiconductor and metal nanoparticle with different Fermi level like TiO2 and Pt nanoparticle, electron transfers from CB of TiO2 to metal Fermi level until equilibrium is attained with the formation of Schottky barrier, which in turn restricts electron-hole recombination. The surface of metal nanoparticles accumulates excess of negative charge, which creates hydrogen reduction site. Similarly, TiO2 exhibits an excess of positive charge on VB, which creates a site for oxidation of alcohol. When sacrificial donor is present in reaction mixture it shows electrostatic interaction. In the presence of sacrificial donor, the oxidation state of metal nanoparticle depends on pH of the solution (Zhou and Fu, 2013). As reported formation of metallic Pt nanoparticle is also confirmed from pH of the reaction mixture i.e. pH = 3.4, if pH is below 5 then Pt0 state forms and for pH above 5 PtO2 state formation is expected (Zhang et al., 2004)."
14,Importance of chloride ions released from H2PtCl6 molecule,"3.8 Importance of chloride ions released from H2PtCl6 molecule In the present study in-situ formation chloride (Cl−) ions appear during chemical photodeposition in the presence of water and ethanol (Harada and Einaga, 2006). Path 1 [Pt(OH)nCl6−n]2− + OH− → [Pt(OH)n+1Cl5−n]2− + Cl− [Pt(OH)n+1Cl5−n]2− + OH− → [Pt(OH)n+2Cl4−n]2− + Cl− [Pt(OH)n+2Cl4−n]2− + OH− → [Pt(OH)n+3Cl3−n]2− + Cl− [Pt(OH)n+3Cl3−n]2− + OH− → [Pt(OH)n+4Cl2−n]2− + Cl− [Pt(OH)n+4Cl2−n]2− + OH− → [Pt(OH)n+5Cl1−n]2− + Cl− [Pt(OH)n+5Cl1−n]2− + OH− → [Pt(OH)n+6Cl0−n]2− + Cl− Another stepwise mechanism for in-situ formation chloride ions from the photoreduction of H2PtCl6 to Pt0 metal nanoparticles with the instantaneous release of Cl− at conductive band as shown in Scheme 1 is explained in path 2. Path 2 H2PtCl6 ⇌ 2H+ + PtCl6 − PtCl6 − + 2e− ⇌ PtCl4 − + 2Cl− PtCl4 − + 2e− ⇌ PtCl2 − + 2Cl− PtCl2 − + 2e− ⇌ Pt0 + 2Cl− (a) The current innovation of the topic is that Cl− released from platinum metal in H2PtCl6 molecule during in-situ photodeposition reaction and it can act as an internal electron donor for the photocatalytic reaction path. (b) In the photoreduction reaction the rapid release of Cl− ions from above paths will takes place which can useful for restrain photogenerated holes. (c) The continuous release of Cl− ions from inorganic sacrificial reagent H2PtCl6 molecule (as shown in above equations) facilitates the parting of opposite charge for longer duration in the reaction and its causes consequential improvement in (H2) hydrogen evolution. (d) Due to more availability of Cl− ions in the reaction there is continuous supply of electrons to semiconductor which enables the charge separations and enhances the photocatalytic hydrogen production. (e) Finally, the experimental results are supporting that the Cl¯ ions in the solution is playing key role for the extraordinary increase in the photocatalytic hydrogen production. (f) The possible hydroxylation of Pt(OH)6]2− ions generated during treatment of PtCl6 in aqueous medium (path 1) generates proton from water for reduction at Pt site. These studies thus demonstrate that as size of Pt nanoparticle and metallic state formed on the surface of TiO2 during photodeposition reaction can be controlled by in-situ Cl− ion formation and by adjusting pH of reaction mixture. Though reports are available on bimetallic TiO2 composite, scanty reports are available on role of in-situ generation of Cl− ion dopant and donor. It is this unique feature which has been investigated in this report. The observed incredible improvement in photocatalytic hydrogen generation rate was due to presence of indigenous Cl− ion and ethanol as a hole scavenger. The reduction of Pt precursor is mostly deepened on hole suppression rate. On illumination of ethanol containing solution in in-situ photodeposition of oxidized Pt was efficiently reduced to metallic Pt0, where Pt nanoparticle act as electron sink to suppress e−-h+ recombination and photon are absorbed by TiO2. PtCl6 3− + CH3CH2OH + hυ → PtCl6 3− + CH3CHO + H+"
15,Short-term stability of catalyst Pt/TiO2 for H2 generation,"3.9 Short-term stability of catalyst Pt/TiO2 for H2 generation A short-term experiment was performed using Pt/TiO2 under optimized condition up to 12 h to test the stability of the catalyst. The Hydrogen generation rate was higher initially, and then a plateau was observed. The increase in photoirradiation time, it ascribes the growth of Pt nanoparticle on surface of TiO2, this may be evidence that formation of Pt-Pt bond that shows decrease in hydrogen evolution rate (HER) with respect to time (Fig. 8 ). The constant of hydrogen generation rate shows the stability of the catalyst."
16,Conclusion,"Enhancement in the photocatalytic activity is due to the homogenous distribution of platinum metal on TiO2 surface by photo-deposition method. Also, Platinum nanoparticle improves hydrogen production rate due to its plasmonic property in addition to its potential to serve as electron sink site for reduction of hydrogen ion. This work also improves hydrogen production rate in UV–Visible for Pt/TiO2 compared with TiO2. The effect of chloride ions released from H2PtCl6 (platinum metal salt) has been reported for its significant positive impact on photocatalytic hydrogen generation reaction. This is attributed to the presence of in-situ generated hole scavenger (chloride ion) wherein the synergy of chloride ion and externally added donor (ethanol) seems to be outperforming the performance of chloride ion and alcohol."
