0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a green carrier of energy with no pollutant emission to environment during the use as fuel [1,2]. Hydrogen can be produced from the electrolysis of water in the circumstance with surplus supply of electricity, while majority of hydrogen are now produced from the reforming of carbonaceous feedstock, especially from fossil fuels [3]. Fossil fuels are not renewable and the use is accompanied with emission of CO2 and the pollutant gases such as NOx and SOx [4]. Thus, attention from research community has shifted to the use biomass or the derivatives of biomass as the feedstock for hydrogen production [5,6]. Biomass can be gasified directly to hydrogen-rich gases, but the transport of bulky biomass into a refinery could significantly enhance cost of the process [7]. Instead, biomass could be pyrolyzed into bio-oil on site where biomass grows, and the bio-oil with a high volumetric energy density could be transported at a much lower cost [8,9]. Bio-oil is complex in composition and its steam reforming is featured with the formation of a substantial amount of coke [10–12]. Bio-oil from the pyrolysis of agricultural and the forestry waste generally contains abundant carboxylic acids and some alcohols [13]. The fermentation of biomass-derived sugars produces mainly ethanol [14]. Based on the above facts, steam reforming of the carboxylic acids like acetic acids [15–17] and the alcohols like ethanol [18,19] have been intensively investigated. Carboxylic acids and alcohols have the varied molecular structures and they could show the distinct catalytic behaviors and the different tendency towards coke formation, the key issue encountered in steam reforming reactions. Understanding the varied coking behaviors of carboxylic acid and alcohol in steam reforming reactions could provide important information for optimizing the process for steam reforming of bio-oil. Further to this, since carboxylic acid and alcohol have the distinct functionalities, they may have the distinct sensitivity or response towards the coke formed on the catalyst. Understanding of this will be beneficial for preparation of the catalysts with the tailored structures for specially reforming of carboxylic acid or alcohol. Although steam reforming of individual ethanol and acetic acid have been widely performed, the detailed difference of their coking behaviors and their reaction behaviors over the coked catalysts has not been fully understood yet. Clarification of this helps to the development of reforming catalyst with the desirable property for effective reforming of these organics. In this study, the steam reforming of ethanol and n-propanol, the representatives of alcohols, as well as acetic acid and propionic acid, the representatives of carboxylic acids, over 18% Ni/SBA-15 catalyst, a commonly used reforming catalyst [20], were conducted at 300–700 °C to investigate the effects of the hydroxyl group and carboxyl group in these organics on their reaction behaviors, especially on the coking behaviors. The reaction behaviors of the alcohols and carboxylic acids with the same carbon number in steam reforming were compared. The reaction intermediates formed in the steam reforming and the properties of the coke formed were characterized in detail. The results show that although the amount of coke produced by carboxylic acid in steam reforming is small, it is more likely to form amorphous coke, which will cover the surface of nickel particles and hinder the further progress of the reaction. On the contrary, although alcohol produces a larger amount of coke during the reaction, because the coke is in the form of carbon nanotubes, it does not hinder the contact between the reactants and nickel, and therefore does not cause catalyst deactivation."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The 18% Ni/SBA-15 catalyst was prepared via an incipient wetness impregnation method. The detailed steps for the catalyst synthesis and the preparation of the SBA-15 support were according to the specified procedure in reference [21]. Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) was selected as the nickel source. The calcination temperature of the catalyst was 600 °C."
3,Characterizations of the catalysts,"2.2 Characterizations of the catalysts The N2-BET test of the catalyst was carried out with BIAODE SSA-6000 apparatus with high purity N2 as the adsorbent to characterize the structural properties of the catalyst. An elemental analyzer (EA) with the brand of EuroEA 3000-Single was used to measure the C and H contents in the coke. The composition of the crystal phase of the catalysts were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Ultima IV, Japan, λ = 1.5406 Å, Cu Kα target) at a voltage of 40 kV. Temperature programmed reduction with hydrogen (H2-TPR) were performed in an apparatus (Vodo VDSorb–91x). The composition and content of gas products were analyzed with gas chromatography (Zhongjiaojinyuan, GC-7920). Gas chromatography coupling with a mass spectrometer (GC–MS, Shimadzu QP 2020) equipped with a Wax pillar column (30 m of length, 0.25 mm of internal diameter, 0.25 μm of film thickness) were used for testing the concentration of the organics. The identification of the organics was achieved with the standard spectra of the National Institute of Standards and Technology library (NIST 2014). The amount and the thermal stability of coke were determined by thermal gravimetric analysis (TG; 8121 Rigaku Corp.) in air and N2 atmosphere, respectively. The distribution of functional groups on the coke in the spent catalyst was characterized by Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT–IR, Nicolet iS50 instrument). Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) of the coke were performed with Biaode PCA–1200 instrument. In-situ diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) characterization was performed with the Nicolet IS 50 spectrometer equipped with a modified Harrick Praying Mantis DRIFT cell to explore the reaction intermediates formed in the steam reforming reactions. The TEM images were taken on a transmission electron microscope (JEOL2100PLUS, Japan) to characterize the morphology of coke. The degree of aromatization of the coke were studied by Raman technique (Horiba LabRam HR Evolution instrument). The details of the characterization could refer to the reference and it also has been listed in Supplementary Material (Table S1) [22]."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests The catalytic tests were conducted on a fixed-bed continuous flow reactor. The configuration of the reactor was shown in Fig. S1. The gas and liquid products were collected respectively every 30 min and characterized by GC and GC-MS. The selected reaction conditions were the steam to carbon ratio (S/C) of 5 and the liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) of 11.4 h−1 with the reaction temperature increasing from 300 to 700 °C. Before feeding the mixed solution of the organics and water into the reactor, the calcined 18% Ni/SBA-15 catalyst was reduced in situ with a flow of the H2/N2 (60 mL/min each). The more detailed experimental procedures could refer to our previous work [23]."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Physicochemical properties of the catalysts,"3.1 Physicochemical properties of the catalysts The hysteresis loop and the distribution of the pores for the Ni/SBA-15 catalyst were shown in Fig. 1 a. The catalyst has IV type isotherm and H2 type hysteresis loop. This is a typical feature of ordered mesoporous materials, which has a relatively large pore size distribution and a wider ink bottle-like “neck” structure [24]. The specific surface area of the Ni/SBA-15 catalyst was 418 m2/g, while the specific surface area of the SBA-15 used in this study was about 600 m2/g [25]. The reason for the decreased specific surface area and mean pore radius was that the nickel ions introduced through the impregnation process entered and blocked the pores of the carrier. The interaction between the nickel species and the porous SBA-15 support was further characterized by H2-TPR via measuring the reducibility of the nickel oxide. The TPR spectrum and the degree of reduction of the reduced Ni/SBA-15 catalyst are shown in Fig. 1b. The three main reduction peaks were located at 437 °C, 526 °C and 616 °C, respectively. The temperature range of the main reduction peak at 437 °C was basically consistent with the temperature range of the reduction peak of unsupported nickel oxide [26]. The ratio of the area of the individual reduction peaks to the total was shown in the inset pie chart. The result indicated that close to half of the nickel oxide just dispersed and with the low interaction with the silica support. The reason for the reduction peak in the high temperature range might be that part of the nickel oxide entered the pores of the support, which made the reduction more difficult due to the mass transfer limitation for the diffusion of hydrogen into the inner pores. The crystal phases composition of the catalysts was also characterized with XRD. Fig. 1c showed the XRD pattern of the catalyst after calcination and reduction. The diffraction peaks at 2 theta degree of 37.2°, 43.3°, 62.7°, 75.4° and 79.5° were attributed to NiO (PDF#78–0643) in the calcined catalyst. The peak of moderate intensity located at 23.2° was attributed to the amorphous silica on the support SBA-15 framework. After the reduction, majority of the NiO crystal phase in the catalyst was reduced to metallic Ni. The peaks at 44.5°, 51.8° and 76.5° were attributed to metallic Ni (PDF#87–0712) in the reduced catalyst. Since the key of this study was to investigate the correlation of the properties of the coke with the structure of catalysts, thus the reaction behaviors of the organics and the characterization of the spent catalysts were focused on the following sections."
7,Catalytic activity,"3.2 Catalytic activity Conversion of the reactants and the distribution of the main gas products are shown in Fig. 2 . Although the reactants were different, the conversion and the change of the yields of the products versus the increasing temperature showed the similar trends. The higher reaction temperature promoted the conversion of the alcohols or carboxylic acids as well as the yield of CO2 and H2. The catalyst was active for the steam reforming reactions at the higher temperatures, while, at the lower reaction temperature, appreciable amount of CO and CH4 were formed as the main by-products. The CO could be formed via the “incomplete” steam reforming reaction as steam could not be fully activated at the low reaction temperatures [26]. CH4 could be formed directly from the cracking reactions and the methanation reaction [27]. Considering the relatively low yields of H2 and CO2 at the mild temperatures such as 400 °C, the CH4 should be formed from the cracking reactions. The low efficiency for activation of steam would create more chances for the cracking of the organics to form CHx species that would have more chance to integrate with H∗ to form CH4. When the temperature continued to rise to the higher region, the reverse water gas shift reaction was promoted, forming higher yields of CO while the CH4, even was formed, could be reformed with steam. There was no significant difference in catalytic activity of the Ni/SBA-15 catalyst in the steam reforming of ethanol, acetic acid, n-propanol and propionic acid. Obviously, under the selected reaction conditions, the metallic nickel was sufficient to catalyze the conversion of the four reactants through steam reforming. Therefore, the coking behaviors of the varied reactants in the steam reforming reactions versus the prolonged reaction time were further investigated."
8,Steam reforming of the organics versus prolonged reaction time,"3.3 Steam reforming of the organics versus prolonged reaction time Steam reforming of the alcohols and carboxylic acids was conducted in a reaction environment that deliberately favored coking (S/C = 2; T = 650 °C, LHSV = 11.4 h−1). Clear signs of catalyst deactivation could be observed in steam reforming of either the alcohols or the carboxylic acids. However, the extent of deactivation, which was demonstrated inside the Figures in terms of the decreased percentage of hydrogen yields from the beginning of the experiments to the end, for the distinct reactants were different. In steam reforming of either ethanol or n-propanol (Fig. 3 a and c), the catalyst deactivated but the loss of hydrogen production was lower than that in the steam reforming of acetic acid or propionic acid (Fig. 3b and d). In the steam reforming reactions, coke formation was the main reason, as reported in numerous studies [28–32]. The results herein suggested that the amount of coke formed in steam reforming of the carboxylic acids should be more significant than that in the steam reforming of the alcohols, which was further investigated via characterization of the spent catalysts."
9,Analysis of coke in the spent catalysts,"3.4 Analysis of coke in the spent catalysts 3.4.1 TG and TPO characterizations The spent catalyst after 6 h of steam reforming was subjected to TG characterization under air and N2 atmosphere, respectively (Fig. 4 ). It can be seen from Fig. 4a that the weight loss rate of the spent catalyst in steam reforming of ethanol was significantly higher than that in steam reforming of acetic acid. The similar results were observed in steam reforming of n-propanol and the propionic acid. This result indicated that the coke was significantly more during the steam reforming of the alcohols than that in steam reforming of carboxylic acids. However, it can be noticed from the Fig. 3 that the activity of the Ni/SBA-15 catalyst decreased more significantly in steam reforming of the two carboxylic acids than that in steam reforming of the alcohols versus the prolonged reaction time. This should be related to the varied type and properties of the coke formed in steam reforming of the alcohols and the carboxylic acids. The higher amount of coke did not necessarily lead to the higher extent deactivation of the catalysts. In addition, the amount of coke formed in the steam reforming of n-propanol and propionic acid was higher than the amount of corresponding ethanol and acetic acid coke with similar carbon chains. For steam reforming either the alcohols or the carboxylic acids, the longer chain of carbon led to the formation of more coke. The cracking of the carbon chains formed the CHx species, the incomplete gasification of which with the hydroxyl group formed from dissociation of steam would lead to coke formation. The longer carbon chain would inevitably lead to the formation of more CHx species, the precursors of coke, and thus more coke deposit. The higher amount of coke formed from steam reforming of the alcohols might be due to their high tendency towards the formation of the thermal coke from cracking reactions. This was further explored in the cracking experiments with the feeding of pure reactants (in absence of steam) at 650 °C for 2 h. The spent catalysts were characterized by TG-Air, and the result is shown in Fig. 4e. In the absence of steam, a higher amount of coke was observed for all the reactants investigated. This was expected as the absence of steam was a condition deliberately favoring coking [33]. However, the thermal coke formed from the cracking of both ethanol and n-propanol was lower than that from the cracking of acetic acid and propionic acid. The carboxylic acids tended to form more thermal coke in the absence of steam. The results herein also demonstrated that reaction intermediates from steam reforming of the alcohols had the higher tendency towards coke formation, while the reaction intermediates from steam reforming of acetic acid and propionic acid showed the lower tendency towards coking. It has been known that the different types of coke have different thermal stability [34]. Thus, the thermal stability of coke formed on the catalysts after steam reforming of different reactants were evaluated in TG characterization of the spent catalyst under N2 atmosphere. The results were shown in Fig. 4c, where it can be found that the thermal stability of the coke in the spent catalyst formed in steam reforming of either ethanol or n-propanol were higher than that in steam reforming of acetic acid and propionic acid. For the coke formed in steam reforming of the two acids, significant weight loss rate could even be observed at ca. 290 °C, as evidenced by the DTG curves (Fig. 4d). It has been reported that the amorphous coke had the lower thermal stability and it could cover the surface of catalysts including metal sites, leading to rapid deactivation of catalysts [35]. It was probably that the coke formed in steam reforming of the carboxylic acids were more likely to be the amorphous coke, which was further investigated. The TPO characterization was performed to probe the resistivity of the coke in the spent catalyst towards oxidation and the results were shown in Fig. 4 (g, h). The difference in oxidation peak temperature also related to the different thermal stability of the coke. When the reactants were n-propanol and ethanol, the oxidation peak located in the higher temperature range, indicating the higher resistivity to the coke in the spent catalyst towards the oxidation. In comparison, the coke formed in steam reforming of acetic acid and n-propionic acid could be oxidized at the lower temperature, which was in line with the results in Fig. 4c, where the thermal stability of coke produced by steam reforming of the alcohols were much higher than that from the steam reforming of the carboxylic acids. This was the further proof that the coke formed in steam reforming of the carboxylic acids was more amorphous. 3.4.2 XRD characterizations The crystal phases of the spent catalysts were characterized with XRD and the results were shown in Fig. 1(d–f). It could be explicitly seen that, when the reactant was alcohol, nickel species on the catalyst presented two crystal forms, the cubic close-packed nickel (PDF#04–0850, Fm-3m) and hexagonal close-packed nickel (PDF#45–1027, P63/mmc). This, however, was only presented on the catalyst after the catalytic test but did not appear in the spent catalyst after the steam reforming versus the prolonged reaction time, probably due to the coverage of nickel species with the large amount of coke. Such a phenomenon, however, was not observed in steam reforming of the carboxylic acids. The reason for this crystallization transition might be that the alcohol was more likely to be adsorbed on the hexagonal closest-packed nickel, while the detailed reason needs further investigation. In addition, it can be found from Fig. 1f that when the reactant was ethanol, the peak attributable to the nickel crystal phase on the spent catalyst shifted to a low angle. At the same time, the peak became wider. The shift of the peak often indicated the change of the interplanar spacing. The shift to a low angle indicated that the interplanar spacing became larger, and the width of the peak is related to the grain size. The broad peaks often represented smaller particle sizes, which was consistent with the calculated particle size. The crystal phase of carbon was also observed in the spent catalysts from the steam reforming of the alcohols [36], while was not in that from steam reforming of the carboxylic acids. Probably, the coke from steam reforming of the alcohols had the high crystallinity (carbon nanotubes), while that from steam reforming of the carboxylic acids were the amorphous coke with low crystallinity. In addition, the particle size of metallic nickel on the coke after the catalytic activity test and the steam reforming test with the extended reaction time were calculated according to the Debye-Scherrer formula. The results are shown in Table S2. When the reactants of steam reforming were acetic acid or propionic acid, the nickel particles on the coke are larger. This might be due to the higher extent of sintering of the metallic nickel. However, this could also relate to the amount of coke formed as the coke could cover nickel species and affected the diffraction of nickel in the characterization. In addition to the crystallinity, the functionalities of the coke in the spent catalysts were further characterized. 3.4.3 FT-IR characterization The results of the FT-IR characterization of the spent catalysts with distinct reactants after steam reforming versus the prolonged reaction time were shown in Fig. 5 a, and the enlarged view was shown in Fig. 5b. The absorption peaks of O–H, –CH2, H–O–H, –OH, C–O–C, Si–O–Si, Si–OH and Si–O functional groups were observed on the surface of the four spent catalysts. Moreover, the CO was detected at 1719 cm−1 in the spent catalyst obtained from steam reforming of ethanol. The adsorption of CC was also observed at 1588 cm−1 [37]. These unsaturated functionalities on the spent catalyst could belong to the reaction intermediates or the precursors of coke or the coke itself. The functional groups of the coke in the spent catalysts from the steam reforming of acetic acid or propionic acid was not obvious, which was related to the lower amount of coke on surface of the catalyst. In order to further explore the properties of the formed coke, EA and Raman characterization were used to analyze the structural properties of the coke. 3.4.4 EA and Raman characterizations The characterization results of elemental composition of the coke in the spent catalysts were listed in Table 1 . Comparing with the spent catalysts after steam reforming of acetic acid or propionic acid, the coke on the spent catalysts after steam reforming of ethanol and n-propanol had a higher carbon content, which was also consistent with the TG characterization (Fig. 4a). In addition, the coke on the spent catalyst after steam reforming of ethanol and n-propanol has a higher C/H, which indicated that the coke had a higher degree of aromatization [25], while the coke formed in steam reforming of the carboxylic acids was less aromatic as the coke had the lower C/H ratio. This explained their lower thermal stability and the lower resistivity towards oxidation. In addition, the aromatic ring structures of the coke was further analyzed with Raman characterization. Fig. 5c was the result for the Raman characterization of ring structure in the coke generated in the steam reforming versus the prolonged reaction time. The D1 peak at 1345 cm−1 corresponds to the plane vibration of the sp2 bonded carbon structure with structural defects [38,39], and the intensity of this peak represents the abundance of the carbon structure with six or more rings. The G band at 1582 cm−1 corresponds to the plane vibration of the sp2 bonded graphite structure, and the G band represents the abundance of aromatic hydrocarbons with less than six rings [40]. Therefore, the ratio of AD/AG can reflect the bigger to the smaller rings of the aromatic structures in the coke. The increase of this ratio can be attributed to the formation of the aromatics with bigger but defective ring structures [41]. It can be seen from Fig. 5d that when the reactants were ethanol and n-propanol, the AD/AG was higher, suggesting that the coke had a greater degree of aromatization. This is also consistent with the result that the coke formed from the steam reforming of n-propanol and ethanol was more thermally stable (Fig. 4). In contrast, the lower ratio of AD/AG for the coke produced by the steam reforming of acetic acid and propionic acid indicated the formation of smaller ring structures in the coke, which was consistent with their lower thermal stability. The Raman area in the coke formed from steam reforming of ethanol was much higher than others, while the carbonyl functionality was also observed in steam reforming of ethanol in the FT-IR characterization (Fig. 5b), indicating the abundant oxygen-containing functionalities in specially in the coke. The properties of the coke were determined by the reaction intermediates formed, which was further characterized with the in–situ DRIFTS characterization. 3.4.5 In–situ DRIFTS analysis The in-situ DRIFTS characterization of the reaction intermediates formed on the surface of the catalyst during the steam reforming of the organics was performed and the results were shown in Fig. 6 . The absorption peaks of O–H, –CH2, –CO2, CO, CO, CC, –OH, Si–O–Si and Si–OH functional groups were observed on the surface of the Ni/SBA-15 catalyst. Si–O–Si and Si-OH are characteristic absorption peaks on silica-based catalyst supports [42,43]. The absorption peak located at 3740 cm−1 is attributed to –OH, which originates from the dissociation of steam or the adsorption of the reactants [23]. The higher reaction temperature generally enhanced the adsorption of the hydroxyl group as the dissociation of steam and the reaction substrate was favored at the high temperature. The absorption peak at 2840–2921 cm−1 is attributed to methyl or methylene functionality [44], the intensity of which was weak with the increase of reaction temperature. Over the Ni/SBA-15 catalyst, the CHx species could possibly be quickly eliminated with other radicals like H∗ or ∗OH, inhibiting their presence on surface of the catalyst. The absorption peak of –CO2 is also observed at 2304–2380 cm−1, especially at the high temperatures. Unexpectedly, the intensity of the CO2 absorption peak was greater in steam reforming of the alcohols than that in the steam reforming of the carboxylic acids. The decarboxylation of the carboxylic acids was obviously not the main reaction routes for the formation of CO2 in the steam reforming of the carboxylic acids. The conversion of the reaction intermediates from steam reforming of the alcohols tended to form more CO2, the desirable products from steam reforming reactions, which was in line with the higher catalytic stability of the catalyst. The absorption peak attributed to CO was located at 1968 cm−1, and the adsorption of CO by the catalyst is also beneficial to alleviate the formation of coke-like substances. The CO peak was much more significant in steam reforming of the C2 reactants like acetic acid and ethanol. The cracking of these C2 reactants generated the CHx and COx species. Especially, the cracking of ethanol via breaking the C–C bond directly formed the COHx species, resulting in the higher abundance of CO species on surface of the catalyst. The CO absorption peak at 1815 cm−1 belongs to the acid anhydride. It is worth noting that although the reactants are different, the absorption peak could all be observed. When the reactant is acids, the appearance of the absorption peak of anhydride might be due to the intramolecular dehydration of the acids during the reaction. When the reactant is alcohols, eg. ethanol, it has been reported that the dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde is the first step in the steam reforming of ethanol, and there may be two reaction paths afterwards: one is direct steam reforming of acetaldehyde, the other is the steam reforming of acetaldehyde via an acetic acid intermediate [45]. The absorption peak at 1692 cm−1 corresponds to the aldehyde group, which was formed via the dehydration of alcohols or carboxylic acids and could be a precursor of coke. It can be found from Table 2 that when the reactants are ethanol and acetic acid, as the reaction temperature increased, the intensity of the CO absorption peak first increased and then decreased, which indicates that in the high temperature region the reaction intermediate bearing the CO functionality could be gasified more efficiently. It can also be found from Fig. 4a that the amount of generated coke in the steam reforming of ethanol and acetic acid was relatively small. When the reactant was n-propanol, the absorption peak intensity of CO increases continuously with temperature, and the intensity was always greater than that of propionic acid. This was also consistent with the fact that the steam reforming of n-propanol generated a large amount of coke. The absorption peak of CC located at 1564 cm−1, which, similar to the intermediates bearing CO, could be the precursor of coke [46]. As the reaction temperature increased, the intensity of the absorption peak almost always increased firstly and then decreased, which also means that the formation of the reaction intermediates bearing the CC functionalities c were suppressed in the high temperature region. However, the steam reforming of n-propanol was an exception. As the temperature increased, the intensity of the CC absorption peak also increased, which led to the formation of a large amount of coke. The varied reaction intermediates would lead to the formation of not only the different amount of coke, but also might lead to the formation of the coke with the distinct morphologies. This was further investigated with the TEM characterizations. 3.4.6 TEM analysis The results for the TEM characterization of the spent catalyst after steam reforming of ethanol, acetic acid, n-propanol and propionic acid with extended reaction time were shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 . Over the Ni/SBA-15 catalyst and the specified experimental conditions, the morphologies of the coke formed on the four spent catalysts was basically in the form of carbon nanotube structure and the encapsulating coke. The carbon nanotubes with uneven thickness and inner pore diameters as well as the varied length, which was mainly determined by the particle size of nickel and the experimental conditions. On the spent catalyst after ethanol steam reforming, the carbon nanotubes were the main form of coke and some amorphous coke were also observed that could cover metallic nickel sites. The carbon nanotubes were varied in length and the thickness distributing in the range of 1.5–18.5 nm. Nickel species on the tip of the nanotubes could be identified. For the spent catalyst after acetic acid steam reforming, there were also abundant nanotube form of coke but with the smaller diameter. The difference in wall thickness of the carbon nanotubes were also large, between 2 and 17.5 nm. Interestingly, a lot of carbon nanotubes have the inner diameter of ca. 7 nm formed in steam reforming of either ethanol or acetic acid. The detailed reason of it is unknown for now but deserve further investigation. On the spent catalyst after steam reforming of n-propanol, carbon nanotubes with a length of more than 6700 nm could be observed. The span of the diameter of carbon nanotubes were relatively large range, between 15 and 78 nm, and the wall of the carbon nanotube was correspondingly thicker (2.5–32.5 nm). When propionic acid was used as the reactant, although some carbon nanotubes structures were observed, a significant portion of coke should exist in the form of amorphous coke as the carbon nanotube structures were much scarcer and the encapsuled coke could be clearly identified (Fig. 8 e-h). In the spent catalyst from steam reforming of acetic acid, the encapsuled coke could also be identified. In consideration of the other characterization of the TG-nitrogen, TPO, XRD and elemental analysis, it could be concluded herein that in the steam reforming of either acetic acid or propionic acid, the formation of the more proportion the amorphous coke led to the quicker deactivation of the Ni/SBA-15 catalyst, even though the amount of the coke formed in steam reforming of the carboxylic acids was less than that in steam reforming of the alcohols. This was because the encapsulated coke covered the catalyst and prevented further contact between the catalyst and the reactants. The BET characterization of the spent catalyst after the short-term stability test can also confirm this conclusion (Table 3 , Fig. 5)."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, the reaction behaviors of the typical alcohols and carboxylic acids in steam reforming reactions were comparatively investigated. The results indicated that the reactivities of the varied reactants was not significantly different in the steam reforming reactions. Nevertheless, the Ni/SBA-15 catalyst deactivated more rapidly in steam reforming of acetic acid or propionic acid than that in the steam reforming of ethanol or n-propanol. The characterization of the coke, however, suggested that the coke was remarkably more during the steam reforming of the alcohols than that in steam reforming of carboxylic acids. In addition, the steam reforming of n-propanol and propionic acid was prone to form more coke than that in steam reforming of ethanol and acetic acid, as the longer chain of carbon led to the formation of more CHx species that were the precursors of coke. The higher tendency of the deactivation of the catalysts in steam reforming of the carboxylic acids was due to the varied properties but not the amount of the coke. The cracking of either pure acetic acid or propionic acid generated more thermal coke than that from the cracking of ethanol and n-propanol. Nevertheless, the reaction of the reaction intermediates from steam reforming of the alcohols with steam produced more coke. The coke formed in steam reforming of n-propanol and ethanol was more aromatic with a higher C/H, higher crystallinity and higher abundance of the large defective aromatic rings, resulting in their higher thermal stability and higher resistivity towards the oxidation. In comparison, the coke formed in steam reforming of the carboxylic acids were more amorphous and thus easier to be decomposed or oxidized. The coke in steam reforming of the alcohols and the carboxylic acids was basically carbon nanotube and the encapsulating form. Nevertheless, the wall thickness and length of the carbon nanotubes varied in steam reforming of the alcohols and the carboxylic acids, due to the involvements of the distinct reaction intermediates. The formation of more amorphous or encapsuled coke in steam reforming of acetic acid or propionic acid was the main reason for the rapid deactivation of the catalyst, although the amount of the coke was less. The types of the coke, in addition to the amount, matters in affecting the catalytic activity. The higher tendency of the carboxylic acids towards the decomposition to form the thermal coke was the main reason for the formation of more amorphous coke in the steam reforming reactions."
