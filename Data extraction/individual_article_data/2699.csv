0,Introduction,"The shortage of fossil fuels and environmental problems have led to the research and development of various clean and renewable resources worldwide, and the photocatalytic conversion of solar energy into hydrogen energy is an attractive candidate to solve the energy shortage and environmental crisis [1–5]. Therefore, much effort has been made towards the development of new photocatalysts for high-efficiency hydrogen production. However, it is difficult to have a broad light absorption range and a strong redox ability, because the two conditions are mutually exclusive. So, some single-component photocatalysts are also seriously limited in the solar energy conversion to hydrogen energy. Nevertheless, there still remains great space for improving photocatalytic activity through bandgap engineering, surface modification, and hybrid functionalization. Notably, exploring efficient composite photocatalysts is one of the important strategies to solve these problems. In various quaternary metal sulfide semiconductors, CZTS with a tunable bandgap, high activity in the long band of visible light, and chemical stability has been seen as promising solar cell applications [6–8] and catalyst [9,10]. In addition, the CZTS bandgap is 1.4–1.5 eV with high absorption coefficient (≥104 cm−1), and the conduction band is higher than hydrogen ions reduction potential. Thus, the CZTS-base photocatalysts are highly expected to function as an efficient photocatalyst for water splitting. Since Wang's team first reported the CZTS for photocatalytic hydrogen production [11], the CZTS photocatalyst has inspired the researchers' keen interest in the exploring of CZTS photocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 production through water splitting. Nevertheless, bare CZTS has low photocatalytic H2 production performance because of the quick recombination of photoinduced charge carriers. So, a variety of methods have been used to enhance the H2 production efficiency of CZTS, for instance, controlling crystallinity [12], using different synthesis methods [13] and so on. Among these strategies, one of the most favorable ways is through the combination of another appropriate semiconductor materials with CZTS to form the heterostructure to decrease the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes and promote the carrier transfer. Therefore, the key to the preparation of CZTS composite catalysts with effective H2 production is to find candidate heterojunctions with suitable band structure. For instance, Sridharan et al. synthesized CZTS/CeO2 heterostructures, which exhibited excellent hydrogen production performance under visible light irradiation [14]. Yuan et al. prepared CZTS decorated CdS nanorods and obtained high photocatalytic activity of hydrogen production [15]. Jiang et al. fabricated CZTS/ZnS composites and exhibited a high and stable visible light photocatalytic H2 generation [16]. Our group used the Ag clusters and conducting polyaniline as the efficient cocatalysts for CZTS nanocrystals, and achieved extraordinary photocatalytic hydrogen production [17]. Although the CZTS catalysts have been explored to effectively promote photocatalyst activity, the development of new CZTS-based composite catalysts to achieve higher photocatalytic activity is still a problem that needs to be further explored. Many semiconductor metal oxides and their heterojunctions have been effectively used in photocatalytic cracking of water to produce hydrogen. Among these materials, cuprous oxide (Cu2O) is an interesting semiconductor, whose conduction band is much more dynamic than the popularly used extensive bandgap semiconductors. At the same time, due to its excellent light absorption capacity, rich earth content and suitable forbidden band, it is widely used in photocatalysis. For example, Sivaprakash et al. embedded Cu2O into the boron carbonitride sheets, and the synthesized composite material had a great influence on the efficiency of hydrogen evolution [18]. Tezcan et al. synthesized Cu2O on ZnO nanorods array with different electrochemical deposition times and achieved efficient water decomposition [19]. Zhang et al. prepared Cu2O/TiO2 composite catalysts and exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance with H2 evolution [20]. Thus, the introduction of Cu2O significantly increased the catalytic activity of the hybrid catalyst. The construction of special electronic transfer paths can not only maintain the adequate energy levels of the photogeneration electron-hole pairs, but also offer extensive light absorption and spatial separation of charge carriers, which are important for achieving more efficient photocatalyst. According to the band structure features of Cu2O and CZTS [17,21], an effective Z-scheme charge transfer could be looking forward to preparation of CZTS/Cu2O as a composite catalyst. There is almost no report on the preparation and photoactivity of the CZTS/Cu2O dualistic system for visible light-driven hydrogen evolution. Motivated by above strategies and the Z-scheme mechanism, in this study, novel Cu2O nanoparticles modified multilevel structure CZTS microspheres were synthesized by simple solvothermal and oxidation-reduction methods for improving efficiency of solar energy utilization and photo-generated charge transportation. As we expected, the Cu2O decorated CZTS shows much higher photocatalytic hydrogen production performance than pristine Cu2O and CZTS. The excellent performance of CZTS/Cu2O photocatalyst is attributed to the Z-scheme electronic transfer mechanism. It can reduce transportation barrier of charge carrier, which is beneficial to separate and transfer of photo-generated electrons and holes, thus improving photocatalytic ability. This work may inspire the fabrication of other catalytic systems with even better photocatalytic performance."
1,Experimental part,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Copper chloride dihydrate (CuCl2·2H2O), zinc chloride (ZnCl2), stannous chloride dihydrate (SnCl2·2H2O), oleyl amine, thiourea (CH4N2S), copper sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O), and ascorbic acid were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., China. Ultrapure water was used throughout the experiment to prepare the solutions. The other reagents were used as received without further purification."
3,Preparation of CZTS,"2.2 Preparation of CZTS The CZTS was prepared by a simple solvothermal method. Typically, ZnCl2 (0.0954 g), SnCl2.2H2O (0.1579 g), CuCl2.2H2O (0.2386 g) and thiourea (0.2131 g) respectively were dissolved in 50 mL of absolute ethyl alcohol and 20 mL of oleyl amine. Then, obtained mixture solution was transferred into 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. Sealed autoclave was kept in oven at 180 °C for 24 h. Then, naturally cooled to room temperature. Final product was centrifuged and washed with double distilled water and ethanol three times and dried it overnight at 60 °C."
4,Preparation of CZTS/Cu2O,"2.3 Preparation of CZTS/Cu2O Decoration of Cu2O nanoparticles on CZTS microspheres was accomplished by simple oxidation-reduction method as follows: the CZTS (0.1 mM) was dispersed in 100 mL of ultrapure water, then 0.1 mM of CuSO4 (the CZTS/Cu2O molar ratio was thus 1:1) was added and stirred for 30 min. 30 mg of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and 10.0 mL of NaOH aqueous solution (2.0 mol L−1) were added into the above suspension. Then, 10 mL of an aqueous ascorbic acid solution (0.6 mol L−1) was added dropwise and the mixture was aged for 3 h under constant stirring at 55 °C. The obtained precipitation was collected by centrifugation and washed continuously (3 times) with deionized water and ethanol. Finally, the obtained solid samples were dried overnight in a vacuum at 60 °C for further use and subsequent characterization. Accordingly, CZTS/Cu2O composite had been synthesized (Scheme 1 ). The molar ratio of CZTS and Cu2O was altered to 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 by changing the concentration of copper sulfate. The samples were denoted as CZTS/Cu2O-1, CZTS/Cu2O-2 and CZTS/Cu2O-3, respectively. For comparison, pure Cu2O was obtained without adding the CZTS under the same condition."
5,Characterization methods,2.4 Characterization methods X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterizations were completed on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffraction device. The surface morphology and element content of the samples were characterized by JSM-7500F field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were performed using a JEM-2100F apparatus. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization was carried out on an ESCALAB-MKII spectrometer. The UV–vis absorption spectra were obtained with a U-4100 UV spectrophotometer.
6,Electrochemical tests,"2.5 Electrochemical tests The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and photocurrent intensity of the catalysts were measured in a conventional three electrode system with the Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, the platinum wire as the counter electrode and the synthetic sample as the working electrode. Typically, the preparation method of working electrode was as follows: 5 mg of CZTS/Cu2O composite photocatalyst was mixed with 20 μL Nafion solution. Then, 1 mL of anhydrous ethanol was added, and the homogeneous catalyst was obtained after ultrasonic dispersion. A rectangular FTO conductive glass with diameter of 5 mm was used to coat the composite catalyst slurry of 30 μL. Then, the catalyst coated FTO substrate was dried in air and heated at 60 °C for 1 h in oven."
7,Photocatalytic hydrogen production activity,"2.6 Photocatalytic hydrogen production activity In a typical photocatalytic H2 evolution experiment, photocatalyst powders (50 mg) were dispersed in a 100 mL aqueous solution containing 90 mL of deionized water and 10 mL of Methanol (Me). A 300 W xenon lamp was used as a source of visible light with light passing through a cut-off filter (λ > 420 nm visible light illumination). Before irradiation by light, the reactor was degassed with N2 for 30 min to remove air from the system. Meanwhile, in order to ensure the temperature uniformity of the suspension, the whole reaction needs circulating cooling water and continuous stirring. Using high purity N2 as the carrier gas, the H2 was analyzed by gas chromatography (Shimazu GC2010) equipped with a 5 Å molecular sieve column and a thermal conductive detector."
8,Results and discussion,"To determine the crystal structure and possible phase changes after Cu2O loading onto CZTS, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns are collected for the pristine CZTS, Cu2O and CZTS/Cu2O composites (Fig. 1 ). The diffraction peaks of the CZTS microspheres appear at 2θ values of 56.3°, 47.3°, 46.2° and 28.4°, and can be allocated to diffraction from the (312), (220), (105) and (112) planes of kesterite structure in Fig. 1 (curve a). The peaks are exactly similar with those shown on JCPDS card No. 026-0575 [22]. No impurity peaks are found, indicating that the purity of CZTS sample is high. From curve b, the characteristic diffraction peaks centered at 73.52°, 61.38°, 42.24°, 36.36° and 29.48° can be respectively assigned to the (311), (220), (200), (111) and(110) lattice planes, indicating the formation of cubic Cu2O crystallites (JCPDS No. 05-0667) [23]. Curves c ~ e show the diffraction patterns of CZTS/Cu2O with different Cu2O amounts, and the diffraction patterns of CZTS and Cu2O are all observed in the CZTS/Cu2O composites. On the other hand, it is found that the entire diffraction peaks are sharp, which indicates that the synthesized CZTS/Cu2O heterogeneous phase is highly crystalline. Furthermore, in the XRD patterns of the composites, the strength of the characteristic peak of the corresponding Cu2O increases with the increase of the Cu2O loading. The crystal sizes of Cu2O particles in three kinds of compound with different proportions are calculated according to Scherrer formula (d = 0.9λ/β cos θ). The particle sizes of Cu2O are about 24 nm, 25 nm and 27 nm respectively. These results confirm the co-existence of CZTS and Cu2O in the heterostructures, and different particle size may affect the catalytic hydrogen evolution. The morphology and structure of the as-prepared CZTS microspheres and CZTS/Cu2O-2 heterostructures are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig. 2 a and b, the prepared CZTS shows flower-like microspheres assembled by nano flakes. In addition, the microspheres have a size distribution in the range of 1–3 μm with the thickness of the nanosheet being 10–20 nm. The formation mechanism of CZTS flower microspheres has been well elucidated. It is thought to be driven by the anisotropic growth trend of CZTS, and its core is easy to form nano flakes and further self-assemble into flower-like microspheres. Fig. 2c and d correspond to the SEM images of the CZTS/Cu2O-2 heterostructures. After introducing Cu2O into the preparation process of photocatalyst, some Cu2O nanoparticles attach to the nanosheets of the CZTS microspheres. These hierarchically assembled CZTS/Cu2O heterostructures can provide more catalytic active sites during the photochemical reaction. It is more important that the intimate contact between CZTS and Cu2O will be in favor of the electrons transfer at the interface of the heterogeneous junction, thus inhibiting the photogenerated the electron-hole pairs recombination. The energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) analysis data of the CZTS/Cu2O-2 heterostructures are shown in Fig. 2e. O, Sn, Zn, S and Cu elements are detected over the entire area of the CZTS/Cu2O-2 heterostructure samples. The more detailed microstructure of CZTS/Cu2O heterostructures is further studied by TEM and HRTEM. Fig. 3 a presents the TEM image of CZTS microsphere. It is clearly seen that the color of nanoflakes which are vertical to the picture is dark, while the color of parallel nanoflakes is light. The edge of nano flower is similar to that of gauze, which further confirms that the synthesized CZTS is deposited and self-assembled through thin nanoplates. Fig. 3b shows the flower-like microsphere morphology of CZTS/Cu2O-2 heterostructures, and the CZTS microsphere becomes thicker and darker due to the addition of Cu2O. HRTEM image shows the morphology and more details of phase information of CZTS/Cu2O-2 heterostructures. In Fig. 3c, the fringe spacing is about 0.31 nm, which can be assigned to the (112) crystal planes of orthorhombic CZTS. The observe lattice fringes with d spacing of about 0.25 nm can be assigned to the (111) lattice plane of Cu2O. It clearly shows that the composites are made up of CZTS and Cu2O. Meanwhile, the intersecting lattice stripes fully verify the subtle atomic-level near contact interface. This structure can significantly improve the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, and it can also prevent the oxidation of Cu+, which can significantly improve the photocatalytic reaction activity. The surface composition and chemical states of the CZTS/Cu2O-2 heterostructures are further investigated by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. Fig. 4 a presents the survey spectrum of the CZTS/Cu2O-2 heterostructure, proving the co-existence of Cu, S, Sn, Zn, O elements. Fig. 4b is part of Fig. 4a, and two characteristic Cu 2p peaks with a split orbit of 19.6 eV locate at 952.7 and 933.1 eV. The two dominant peaks can be assigned to Cu (I). As shown in Fig. 4c, the Zn 2p spectrum shows the peaks at binding energy of 1044.0 and 1021.7 eV with a splitting energy of 22.6 eV, which are described to the core level Zn 2p 1/2 and Zn 2p 3/2 signals, respectively. The Sn 3d spectrum is fitted to the 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 peaks located at 487.6 eV and 496.0 eV with a peak separation of 8.4 eV, confirming the presence of Sn (IV) (Fig. 4d). O1 s centered peaks at 532.9 eV in Fig. 4f is ascribed to the Cu-O of Cu2O. Moreover, in Fig. 4e, it is also observed that the doublet peaks centered at 161.4 and 162.5 eV with a splitting energy of 1.1 eV correspond to S 2p 3/2 and S 2p 1/2, revealing the presence of sulfur element. It can be seen from the XPS spectra, no other valences such as Sn (II) and Cu (II) are found corresponding to that of secondary phases Cu2SnS3 and CuS. These XPS test results are consistent with previous literature reports [24,25]. Excellent optical property is important for photocatalysts, so the UV–Vis absorption spectra of pristine CZTS microspheres, Cu2O nanoparticles and different Cu2O decorated CZTS composite catalysts are collected and shown in Fig. 5 a. It can be clearly seen that the pure CZTS shows wide absorption from ultraviolet to visible light. The absorption edge for pure Cu2O sample is approximately 630 nm, exhibiting its excellent visible light absorption capacity. Further observation shows that all CZTS/Cu2O heterojunction samples exhibit absorption characteristics in the visible light range of 400–800 nm. Meanwhile, compared with pure CZTS and Cu2O, the absorption edges of CZTS/Cu2O heterojunctions are changed, indicating the formation of heterostructures. The absorption intensities of CZTS/Cu2O heterostructures are gradually improved with the increasing the mole ratio of Cu2O in the composites, and the absorption edges exhibit an apparent red-shift compare with Cu2O. Obviously, the results imply that CZTS/Cu2O heterostructures can make good use of low energy lights. So, it makes more efficient use of solar energy. However, excessive Cu2O nanoparticles can shield the CZTS, which is be not beneficial to the absorption and propagation of light. This is the reason why the CZTS photocatalyst loaded with the 0.5 mmol Cu2O has a relatively weak absorption of light. The CZTS/Cu2O-2 heterojunction has high UV–visible light absorption, and the band gap energies (Eg) of CZTS/Cu2O-2 heterojunctions, pure CZTS and Cu2O can be estimated by the Tauc equation: (1) α h v = A ( h v − E g ) n 2 where A, Eg, v, h and α are representative to a constant, the band gap energy, light frequency, the plank constant and the absorption coefficient. And n represents 4 and 1 for the indirect and direct bandgap semiconductors, respectively. As calculate using the equation, the band gap values of CZTS, Cu2O and CZTS/Cu2O-2 are approximately 1.61, 2.31 and 1.82 eV, respectively. These results are shown in Fig. 5b, which are similar to previously reported results about values for CZTS [26] and Cu2O [27]. For the CZTS/Cu2O heterojunctions, this result distinctly shows that the loading of Cu2O on CZTS microspheres changes the band gap compared with bare CTZS. Under the visible light irradiation, the photocatalytic performance is evaluated by a photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction, and CH3OH (Me) acts as hole scavenger. As illustrated in Fig. 6 a, there is almost no hydrogen produced when pure Cu2O is used as a photocatalyst, suggesting the pure Cu2O is inactive to photocatalytic H2 production. Pure CZTS exhibits a higher photocatalytic activity compared with Cu2O, whereas CZTS/Cu2O shows a higher photocatalytic H2 production performance than that of CZTS and Cu2O for 2 h. In order to further examine the photocatalytic activity, the H2 evolution rate was calculated and shown in Fig. 6b. Clearly, due to the easy occurrence of light corrosion phenomenon [28], The bare CZTS shows a relatively higher photocatalytic hydrogen production rate (112.7 μmol h−1) than bare Cu2O nanoparticles. However, the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of CZTS is still low due to the rapid recombination of photon-generated carriers. Compared to the pristine CZTS and Cu2O, it is clearly seen that after integrating a very small amount of Cu2O (0.1 mmol) with CZTS (CZTS/Cu2O-1), the hydrogen production rate reaches at 569.31 μmol h−1. Because of the synergistic effect between CZTS and Cu2O, the hydrogen production efficiency of the heterojunction is significantly improved. Furthermore, the rate of hydrogen evolution rises with increasing the quality ratio of Cu2O. The maximum rate is 897.23 μmol h−1 (CZTS/Cu2O-2), which is 7.7 times as much as that of CZTS. However, when the amount of Cu2O increases further, the H2 production rate starts to decline. The reason for this result may be that the introduction of excess Cu2O may cover the surface of CZTS, which is not beneficial to visible light absorption. These results lead to a decrease in the number of photogenerated carriers. Apart from the outstanding H2 evolution activity, the stability of photocatalyst is very important for the practical application of catalysts. Therefore, under the same conditions, the long-term optical stability and repeatability of CZTS/Cu2O-2 heterojunctions are further evaluated by four consecutive experiments. It can be found that the catalytic performance of CZTS/Cu2O-2 heterojunctions does not obviously decrease after 20 h testing under visible light irradiation (Fig. 6c). The above results reveal that CZTS/Cu2O heterojunction possesses high-efficiency and high-stability of photocatalytic hydrogen production activity. In order to analyze the separation and migration efficiency of photoelectrons and holes in the samples, photoelectric measurements are carried out by the electrochemical workstation, and the results are shown in Fig. 7 . In Fig. 7a, the pure CZTS and Cu2O give photocurrent intensity of 1.72 and 0.44 μA cm−2 under visible light irradiation, respectively. The low photocurrent response of CZTS and Cu2O could be owing to the rapid recombination of photoproduction electrons-hole pairs. Noticeably, compared with pure CZTS and Cu2O, all the CZTS/Cu2O heterojunctions obtain an extensive rise in photocurrent density. This implies that the modification of CZTS microspheres with Cu2O nanoparticles promotes the separation and transfer of photoproduction charge carriers, and suppresses the recombination of photoproduction electron-hole pairs. When the load of Cu2O is 0.2 mmol (CZTS/Cu2O-2), the photocurrent signal of electrode is further enhanced than that of the other CZTS/Cu2O heterojunctions. These results further confirm that as-prepared CZTS/Cu2O heterojunction is an effective catalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen production application. Fig. 7b shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and the results present in the form of Nyquist plots. The EIS is conducted in the frequency range of 10~104 Hz using an amplitude of 5 mV at the open circuit potential of the system. It is used to investigate the transfer ability of charge carriers. Obviously, the Nyquist impedance plot of CZTS/Cu2O-2 heterojunction has the smaller arc size in contrast to pure CZTS and Cu2O. The observed semi arcs have been fitted with ZView software (equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 7b) to determine the interface charge transfer resistance (Rct). The Rct value for Cu2O is found to be 489 Ω/cm2, which is found to reduce to 327 Ω/cm2 and 214 Ω/cm2 for CZTS and CZTS/Cu2O-2 photoelectrodes, respectively. It also indicates that the lower charge-transfer resistance and the lower recombination rate of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs on the electrode surface in CZTS/Cu2O-2 heterojunction [29]. On the other hand, it is also implied that the Z-scheme system can accelerate the migration speed and improve separation efficiency of photoinduced charge carriers. To help understand the potential mechanism of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, the edge positions of the conduction band and valence band of CZTS and Cu2O are calculated according to the absolute electronegativity values. The calculation formula is as follows: (2) E VB = χ - E e + 0.5 E g (3) E CB = E VB - E g Where χ is the geometric mean of electronegativity of the constituent atoms forming the semiconductor materials (χSn = 4.30, χS = 6.22, χCu = 4.48, χZn = 4.45, and χO = 7.54) [30]. EVB is valence band edge potential. Ee is the free electron energy on hydrogen scale, which is 4.5 eV. ECB is conduction band edge potential. Eg is bandgap, and the test values are estimated from Fig. 5b (CZTS and Cu2O). The values of χ calculated for CZTS and Cu2O are 4.54 and 5.33, respectively. The corresponding positions of ECB and EVB of CZTS (vs. NHE) are found to appear at −0.77 eV and 0.85 eV. Analogously, ECB and EVB of Cu2O are found to appear at −0.33 eV and 1.98 eV. To verify the results of the calculation, the VB energy levels of CZTS and Cu2O are detected by VB-XPS and Mott−Schottky curves, and the corresponding results are plotted in Fig. 8 . The flat band potentials (Efb) calculated from the interception of the linear regions of these plots are 0.60 and 1.70 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) for CZTS and Cu2O (Fig. 8), respectively. For an n-type semiconductor, the CB potential is approximately equal to the flat-band potential. However, the flat-band potential is approximately equal to the VB potential of the p-type semiconductor [31]. Therefore, the EVB for CZTS and Cu2O are roughly reckon up to be 0.80 V and 1.90 V versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) (ENHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.197 V). Meanwhile, VB-XPS spectroscopy of Cu2O and CZTS/Cu2O heterojunctions are shown in Fig. 8b. From the VB-XPS spectra, the VB potentials of pure CZTS and Cu2O are determined to be 0.83 and 1.88 eV. Obviously, the experiment values are close to the calculated results. To be clear at a glance, the CB and VB energy levels of CZTS and Cu2O have been schematically illustrated in Fig. 9 . It illustrates the proposed charge transfer mechanism of the CZTS/Cu2O direct Z-scheme with a heterojunction structure for hydrogen evolution. The interfaces of the two materials are in close contact with each other. The valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) positions for Cu2O and CZTS are calculated to be 0.81 eV and −0.32 eV. Thus, under light irradiation, the photogenerated holes tend to keep in the VB of Cu2O, while the electrons in CB of Cu2O combine with the holes in VB of CZTS. The electrons in the VB of CZTS are further excited to its CB resulting in an efficient space separation of the photogenerated charge carriers. Then, the electrons in the CB of CZTS reduce the proton to produce H2 gas while the holes in the VB of Cu2O underwent oxidation of sacrificial agents. It can create a unique channel for Z-scheme charge transfer in CZTS/Cu2O heterostructures at the interface of two semiconductor materials, which is beneficial to transfer and separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, so as to improve the photocatalytic performance. At the same time, the Z-scheme mechanism photocatalysts retain the stronger reduction and oxidation ability, which is helpful to improve the performance of hydrogen evolution [32]. Obviously, for the CZTS/Cu2O composite photocatalyst, both the conduction band minimum and valence band maximum of CZTS are higher than the corresponding positions of Cu2O. When the CZTS/Cu2O heterojunctions are illuminated, the photogenerated electrons in the conduction band of Cu2O can be easily transferred to the valence band of CZTS and recombine with the photogenerated hole of CZTS. Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes of Cu2O are applied to oxidize the sacrificial agents to finish the catalytic cycle. Therefore, the recombination rates of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in both CZTS and Cu2O would decrease, which results in more reduction of H+ to H2 by the electrons accumulated in the conduction band of CZTS, thus enhancing the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution."
9,Conclusions,"In summary, an efficient visible-light-driven Z-scheme CZTS/Cu2O heterojunction with intimate interface contact was fabricated by simple method. The synergistic effects between CZTS and Cu2O make sure the high-water splitting capacity of CZTS/Cu2O with Z-scheme heterostructures. The optimal hydrogen evolution rate over CZTS/Cu2O is 859.6 μmol h−1, which is 7.7 times higher than that of pure CZTS. Moreover, the cyclic experiment proves that the CZTS/Cu2O heterojunction has a good stability in the photocatalytic hydrogen production. This study could provide a promising example for the design of novel Z-scheme heterostructures with strong photopic response and high photocatalytic performance."
