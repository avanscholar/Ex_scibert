0,Introduction,"Nowadays, global energy requirements are mostly dependent on fossil fuels, which contribute to global climate change, environmental degradation and health problems [1]. Hydrogen is a clean and efficient energy source and has been deemed as a potential energy carrier of the future. People believe that hydrogen-based economy may contribute to meet the growth in world energy demand. Current production of hydrogen can be divided into chemical–physical and biological methods. The chemical–physical methods (e.g., hydrocarbon reformation, water electrolysis) are energy-intensive and expensive. In contrast, the biological methods using renewable resources are environmentally favorable and consume less energy under mild operating conditions [2,3]. Research on biological hydrogen production has been carried out for over a quarter of a century [4], and the biological hydrogen production promises to be an economical and sustainable technology if conversion efficiencies can be increased. Several types of microorganisms such as the photosynthetic bacteria, cyanobacteria, algae or fermentative bacteria are commonly utilized for biological hydrogen production [5]. The hydrogen-producing fermentative bacterium include strict anaerobes (Clostridia, methylotrophs, rumen bacteria, archaea), facultative anaerobes (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Citrobacter) and even aerobes (Alcaligenes, Bacillus) [6]. Among the large number of microbial species, Clostridium sp., which is recognized as an effective hydrogen producer, is the dominant bacteria in the heat-pretreatment of seed sludge that enriched from cow compose, small panda dung, sludge and other resources [7,8]. However, the production of biological hydrogen with pure strain of Clostridium sp. has been rarely reported [9–11]. It is of great significance to reveal the mechanism and characteristic of hydrogen production with Clostridium sp. in order to improve hydrogen production performance of a mixed-culture system. Moreover, the information regarding hydrogen-producing characteristics of Clostridium beijerinckii is surprisingly lacking. The fermentative bacteria are favorable candidates for large-scale hydrogen production due to its higher rate as well as the versatility of the organic substrates used. However, the main constraint is the low yield of hydrogen per mole of organic substrate consumed. Therefore, improvement in yields of hydrogen production is a crucial step towards its commercialization. There are several methods to improve the yield of hydrogen, e.g., genetic operations, detection of mutants, metabolic pathway control and fermentation conditions optimization, etc. For example, Khanal et al. [12] found that a lower initial pH could have caused a metabolic alteration (variation of the acetate/butyrate ratio) and a consequent increase in hydrogen production. Chittibabu et al. reported that recombinant E. coli BL21, in which [Fe]-hydrogenase encoding gene was over-expressed in fast growing non-hydrogen producing E. coli, had a much higher hydrogen yield of 3.12mol/mol-glucose than the wild strain [13]. van Ginkel et al. [14] found that conversion to hydrogen was more efficient at lower substrate loadings at a constant ammonium concentration. Among the improvement approaches, the optimization of fermentation conditions is important and most convenient to be handled for hydrogen process development. In the present work, we isolated hydrogen-producing anaerobes (identified as C. beijerinckii) from anaerobic sludge in an anaerobic bioreactor. Important fermentation process parameters, including carbon source, nitrogen source, initial medium pH, phosphate buffer concentration and temperature, were investigated to identify the proper conditions for hydrogen production with the pure isolate in batch cultivations."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Environment samples,"2.1 Environment samples The bacterial samples were collected from anaerobic sludge in an anaerobic bioreactor that was seeded with heat-pretreated small panda manure obtained from Zhengzhou zoo. Hydrogen (176mL) was produced at 36°C and pH 5.5±0.5 from each gram of corn straw that was pretreated with microbe additives (provided by Gaojiawang Inc., China) under anaerobic condition at 25°C for 15 days."
3,Isolation of hydrogen-producing strains,"2.2 Isolation of hydrogen-producing strains The basal medium used for isolation and cultivation of hydrogen-producing strains consisting of 10g/L glucose, 3g/L peptone, 1g/L yeast extract, 1g/L KH2PO4, 1g/L K2HPO4, 0.5g/L l-cysteine·HCl·H2O, 0.1g/L FeSO4·7H2O, 0.1g/L MgCl2. The pH of the medium was adjusted initially to 6.5. The sludge sample was diluted with sterile distilled water, spread onto agar plates and then incubated at 36°C under anaerobic condition. Single colonies obtained on agar plates were re-streaked more than three times to ensure the purity of the strains. The microbiological work was performed in an Anaerobic Glove Box (Shanghai Yuejin Medical Instruments Factory, China) under a gas mixture containing 85% N2, 10% H2 and 5% CO2. Single colonies were transferred into a serum bottle containing the basal media. The bottles of 140mL (working volume, 50mL) had been flushed with nitrogen gas, capped with rubber stopper and then sterilized by autoclaving at 121°C for 20min. The cultivations were performed at 36±1°C in a gyratory incubator with a shaking speed of 120rpm, and the hydrogen-producing bacteria were selected based on the existence of hydrogen in the evolved gas from the serum bottles. The colony with highest hydrogen production activity was selected for further analysis. The strains were stored at −18°C in sterile 20% (v/v) glycerol solution with an anaerobic environment."
4,Morphological test,"2.3 Morphological test Morphological examinations were performed with a light microscope CH-30 (Olympus, Japan) and an electron microscope AMRAY-1000B (Amray Surg Equip Ltd, USA). Gram staining was performed by the Hucker method, as described by Doetsch [15]."
5,Strain identification,"2.4 Strain identification The identification by 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis was carried out as follows. The genomic DNA was extracted from cells with the standard method [16] and the 16S rDNA gene was amplified by PCR as described [17]. The double-stranded PCR products were sequenced. The 16S rDNA sequence was aligned and identified best matches of the genes against existing DNA sequences in GenBank database using the BLAST program. Automated identification was conducted with Vitek Auto Microbic System (VITEK-32, BioMerieux Vitek, Inc., USA) using VITEK ANI Card."
6,Hydrogen production in the batch culture,"2.5 Hydrogen production in the batch culture The isolate with the highest hydrogen-producing activity was pre-cultured on basal medium and the early-stationary-phase culture was transferred to140mL serum bottles containing 50mL of basal fermentation media to undergo batch hydrogen fermentation. The basal fermentation medium was prepared as follows: 10g glucose, 3g peptone, 1g yeast extract, 0.5g l-cysteine·HCl·H2O, 0.1g FeSO4·7H2O, 0.1g MgCl2, 10mL mineral salt solution (contained 0.01g/L MnSO4·7H2O, 0.05g/L ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.01g/L H3BO3, 0.01g/L CaCl2·2H2O, 0.01g/L Na2MoO4, 0.2g/L CoCl2·6H2O, 0.01g/L AlK(SO4)2·12H2O, 0.001g/L NiCl·6H2O) and 5mL vitamin solution (contained 0.01g/L cobalamin, 0.025g/L Vitamin C, 0.025g/L riboflavin, 0.02g/L citric acid, 0.05g/L pyridoxal, 0.01g/L folic acid and 0.025g/L creatine) were dissolved in 1L of KH2PO4–Na2HPO4 buffer (final concentration 0.20M, pH 6.47). The bottles were shaken at 36±1°C (unless stated otherwise) and 120rpm in the air bath. To determine the effects of various operating parameters on hydrogen production activity, type and concentration of substrate, the pH value, the phosphate buffer concentration and temperature were alternately varied. The biogas volume at regular intervals was measured by releasing the pressure in the bottles using displacement of saturated brine. Cell concentration, pH, carbohydrate concentration and production of biogas and soluble metabolites were also determined. All the experiments were carried out independently in triplicates. The standard deviation in results was within 5%."
7,Analytical methods,"2.6 Analytical methods The concentrations of hydrogen, volatile fatty acids and alcohol were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC, Agilent 4890) [7]. Glucose was measured by the anthrone–sulfuric acid method [18]. The cell dry weight was determined by centrifuging the culture broths (3000g, 10min), washing twice with distilled water and drying at 105°C until constant. Hydrogen gas production was calculated from the headspace measurement of gas composition and the total volume of biogas produced at each time interval using the mass balance equation: (1) V = V 0 γ i + ∑ V i γ i where V is the cumulative hydrogen gas volumes at the current (i); V 0 is the volume of headspace of vials; V i is the biogas volume discharged from the vials at the time interval (i) and γ i is the fraction of hydrogen gas discharged from the vials at the time interval (i)."
8,Kinetic modeling,"2.7 Kinetic modeling The cumulative volume of hydrogen produced in the batch experiments followed the modified Gompertz equation: (2) H = P exp { − exp [ R m e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where H is the cumulative hydrogen production (mL); λ the lag time (h), P the hydrogen production potential (mL), R m the maximum hydrogen production rate (mL/h) and e the 2.718281828. The values of P, R m and λ for each batch were estimated using the solver function in Excel (version 5.0, Microsoft) with a Newtonian algorithm. In this study, R m is expressed as mL/g-substrate h−1, the specific hydrogen production potential (P s) is defined as mL/g-substrate."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Isolation and identification of high hydrogen-producing strain,"3.1 Isolation and identification of high hydrogen-producing strain Ten strains capable of producing hydrogen were screened and purified from the anaerobic sludge sources. The isolates only grew under strict anaerobic conditions. Among the isolates, a bacterial strain Fanp3 with the highest hydrogen production activity was obtained. The bacteria had a rod shape (Fig. 1 ), with the diameter from 0.5μm to 0.9μm and the length from 2.0μm to 4μm. The cells had rounded ends and occurred singly or in pairs. They exhibited Gram-positive staining in both the exponential and stationary growth phases. Spore was observed when nutrients are exhausted or other conditions become unfavorable for growth. The nearly full-length sequences of 16S rDNA gene (1395bp) were determined for the isolate. By aligning with the 16S rDNA gene sequences from GenBank releases, the strain Fanp3 exhibited 99% sequence identity with C. beijerinckii NCIMB8052. The detection data from BioMerieux Vitek showed that the strain belonged to the species C. beijerinckii. According to multiple analysis results, we placed the high hydrogen-producing strain in the species C. beijerinckii Fanp3. In addition, the 16S rDNA gene sequence of C. beijerinckii Fanp3 had been deposited in the GenBank under accession number DQ839378."
11,Hydrogen production with various carbon sources,"3.2 Hydrogen production with various carbon sources The effects of different carbon sources on hydrogen production with C. beijerinckii Fanp3 were investigated. The batch tests were performed in basal fermentation media (pH 6.5) containing 10g/L each carbohydrate as a carbon source. Table 1 summarized the estimated kinetic parameters P s, λ, R m and R 2, which were computed from the experimental data using Eq. (2). As shown in Table 1, the bacterium utilized various carbohydrates, and glucose and sucrose were found to be suited for hydrogen production among the monosaccharides and disaccharides, respectively. The hydrogen yield from glucose was 231.6mL/g-carbohydrate, which was lower than the yield of 274.7mL/g-carbohydrate from sucrose. However, R m (30.3mL/g-carbohydrate h−1) from glucose was higher than that from sucrose. Dextrin was also a suitable substrate, which showed the maximal R m of 38.4mL/g-carbohydrate h−1 with the corresponding P s of 222.6mL/g-carbohydrate. When lactose or CMC was applied as the substrate, the lower hydrogen yields and longer lag times (about 16–16.5h) were observed. In addition, soluble starch and cellulose were hardly utilized. These observations indicate that various types of carbohydrate presented in the wastes could be used for hydrogen production, which will be of great benefit to waste recycling. When glucose was used as the carbon source, the initial glucose concentration had an influence on hydrogen production in the basal fermentation medium. Fig. 2 depicts the time courses of hydrogen production with glucose ranging from 5g/L to 35g/L. As can be seen from Fig. 2, plots based on Eq. (2) satisfactorily fit the cumulative hydrogen production data. The maximal hydrogen yield reached 298mL/g-glucose (2.40mol/mol-glucose) at 5g/L, and then the hydrogen yield gradually decreased with an increase in glucose concentration. The lag time showed an enhancive trend with an increasing glucose level. The longer lag time was attributed to the higher glucose concentration-gap between the pre-cultural and growth conditions. To better understand glucose levels effect on hydrogen production, the residual glucose, cell, P s, R m and hydrogen production activity were plotted against the corresponding glucose concentration as shown in Fig. 3 . R m showed a constant value of about 30.3mL/g-glucose h−1 at glucose concentrations of 5g/L and 10g/L, and then decreased gradually with an increase in concentration of up to 35g/L. When glucose was at low concentration range from 5g/L to 20g/L, almost all of the glucose was consumed and the final cell concentration obviously increased after 80h of cultivation. When glucose concentration further elevated from 20g/L to 35g/L, the amount of residual glucose increased from 1.18g/L (glucose conversion 94.1%) to 17.2g/L (glucose conversion 50.9%), and the final cell growth (approximately 0.8g/L) was not much different. The maximum hydrogen yield based on substrate consumption was 2.52mol/mol-glucose. A significant decrease in hydrogen production activity could be achieved as the value of glucose was raised from 5g/L to 10g/L, beyond which the activity slightly changed. Fig. 3 also showed that the P s decreased with increasing glucose concentration. These phenomena revealed that the higher substrate concentrations induced excess shock load and the lower substrate concentrations were more effectively utilized. In addition, the metabolism for hydrogen production was connected to that of volatile fatty acid production. The lower hydrogen yield at higher substrate concentration suggested that the carbon flux was more directed to the production of reduced by-products such as organic acids and alcohol [13]. In view of conversion efficiency and production intensity, 10g/L glucose was used as carbon source in the following experiments."
12,Hydrogen production with various nitrogen sources,"3.3 Hydrogen production with various nitrogen sources Nitrogen source is vital in fermentation process since it affects the synthesis of enzymes involved in both primary and secondary metabolisms. The effects of various inorganic and organic nitrogen sources using 10g/L glucose as carbon source were tested for their capacity to support hydrogen production. As shown in Fig. 4 , inorganic nitrogen sources NH4NO3 and NaNO3 showed especially low efficiency on hydrogen production. The reason may be that inorganic materials lack of some growth factors that are necessary for microbe growth and hydrogen production. In contrast, organic nitrogen sources, including peptone, yeast extract and beef extract, exhibited higher production yield and were more suitable for hydrogen production because they not only act as the nitrogen sources but also support growth factor, α-amino acid and salt. Fig. 4 also showed effects of nitrogen source concentration in the basal fermentation medium on hydrogen production. Hydrogen yield declined with an increase in yeast extract or beef extract concentration, and the maximal hydrogen yield of about 305.0mL/g-glucose was observed at 2.0g/L yeast extract. When peptone was applied as nitrogen source, the hydrogen yield elevated from 197.6mL/g-glucose to 271.3mL/g-glucose with increasing concentration from 2g/L to 4g/L, and then slightly decreased with a further increase. Hydrogen yields seriously changed using the concentration of each inorganic nitrogen sources in the range from 2g/L to 8g/L, and the lowest yield appeared at that of 8g/L. The inhibition and suppression of hydrogen production at high inorganic nitrogen concentration were more remarkable than at high organic nitrogen concentration. It was interesting that hydrogen yield using 4g/L urea as sole nitrogen source was similar with that of peptone. Since urea is relatively cheap compound and practical for industrial application compared with peptone, yeast abstract and beef abstract, it was selected for the forthcoming experiments at 4g/L. From the above factors, it is clear that C. beijerinckii Fanp3 has excellent ability to utilize various types of nitrogen sources for efficient hydrogen production, which also indicates that the strain has the potential of converting renewable wastes into hydrogen."
13,Effect of initial pH,"3.4 Effect of initial pH In order to determine the optimum initial pH of the medium for hydrogen production, various initial pH of 4.92, 5.29, 5.91, 6.47, 6.98, 7.38 and 8.04 were investigated with C. beijerinckii Fanp3 at the fixed glucose 10g/L and urea 4g/L. The initial pH values were adjusted with 0.20M phosphate buffer. As shown in Fig. 5 , the optimal pH range was 6.47–6.98 where P s and R m were 246.2–252.9mL/g-glucose and 29.9–30.0mL/g-glucose h−1, respectively. Deviating from the optimal pH, both P s and R m decreased significantly. The lag time was also significantly influenced by the initial pH. It was prolonged when the initial pH was inappropriate. The shortest lag time was obtained at initial pH 6.47. It should be emphasized that no hydrogen generation and cell growth were observed at pH 4.92, because the low pH destroyed the cell's ability to maintain internal pH. This finding was consistent with most previous works, in which the optimum initial pH value for hydrogen-producing system occurred in the range of pH from 5.0 to 7.0 [6]. The results clearly exhibited that the initial pH considerably affected the hydrogen productivity because the pH may directly affect the hydrogenase activity [19] and/or the metabolism pathway [20]."
14,Effect of phosphate buffer concentration,"3.5 Effect of phosphate buffer concentration The generation of hydrogen by fermentative bacteria usually accompanies the formation of volatile fatty acid as metabolic products. Since acid accumulation caused a sharp drop of culture pH and subsequent inhibition of bacterial hydrogen production, the effects of phosphate buffer concentrations (0–0.30M) in the medium on hydrogen production were tested by keeping the other operative conditions (initial pH 6.47, initial glucose concentrations 10g/L and urea concentrations 4g/L) constant. As shown in Fig. 6 and Table 2 , a significant increase in the cumulative hydrogen yield could be achieved by raising phosphate buffer concentration from 0M to 0.15M. The maximum P s of 252.8mL/g-glucose and R m of 39.0mL/g-glucose h−1 occurred at the phosphate buffer concentration of 15g/L. After that, the P s and R m decreased gradually with increasing phosphate buffer concentration, which was likely due to the negative effect of increased cytoplasmic osmotic pressure. When no phosphate buffer was added in the medium, the generation of hydrogen began immediately without any lag phase (λ =0h). The final pH increased from 4.20 to 6.02 when phosphate buffer concentrations enhanced from 0M to 0.3M. The lower phosphate buffer concentrations could have caused the high pH depletion. Thus, using phosphate buffer could control the pH and alleviate the medium acidification. As to the cell concentration, an opposite trend was observed as shown in Table 2. At the higher phosphate buffer concentration above 0.25M hydrogen production and cell growth were seriously suppressed, where plots based on Eq. (2) unsatisfactorily fit the cumulative hydrogen production data. These results showed that using phosphate buffer was critically important for a successful fermentative hydrogen production by C. beijerinckii Fanp3. The positive effect of phosphate was mainly due to the buffering capacity more than its nutritious value."
15,Effect of temperature,"3.6 Effect of temperature Operation temperature is frequently a key parameter on the performance of a fermentative process. The hydrogen production rate by C. beijerinckii Fanp3 was varied with temperature ranging from 15 to 45°C. As can be seen in Fig. 7 , the specific hydrogen production rate increased with increasing temperature from 15°C to 35°C while afterwards it dropped significantly. The maximum hydrogen production rate (39.0mL/g-glucose h−1) was obtained at 35°C. It was found that 45°C was critical temperature for hydrogen production because of the inhibition with cell growth and hydrogen production. These results showed a slight difference with the reported work on Clostridium paraputrificum M-21[10], where the hydrogen production and cell growth increased up to 45°C. At high temperature, the denaturation rate of the enzymes in fermentative hydrogen production process was increased [13], which could lead to enzymes inactivation and hydrogen yield decrease. The activation energy (E a) from the Arrhenius plot (inset in Fig. 7) for hydrogen production was calculated as 81.01kcal/mol considering glucose as a substrate. The high regression coefficients (R 2 =0.9745) suggest that the Arrhenius equation could adequately describe the relationships between temperature and hydrogen production. Temperature may also affect the metabolic pathway, resulting in a shift of by-product compositions. Table 3 summarizes the distribution of soluble metabolites production at various temperatures. The dominant metabolic products of hydrogen fermentation are acetic acid (HAc), butyric acid (HBu), ethanol (EtOH) and butanol (BuOH). According to Table 3, the total amount of soluble metabolites increased with increasing temperature from 580.85±24.5mg/L at 15°C to 1904.5±51.3mg/L at 35°C, but dropped to 1808.4±49.1mg/L at a higher temperature of 40°C. Meanwhile, (EtOH+BuOH)/SMP ratio decreased along with the increase in (HAc+HBu)/SMP ratio. The EtOH and BuOH were major aqueous products at lower temperatures such as 15°C. However, HAc and HBu (accounting for over 74% of SMP) became predominance at higher temperatures such as 35°C. Comparison between hydrogen production (Fig. 7) and soluble metabolites production (Table 3) showed that the better hydrogen production was accompanied by a higher (HAc+HBu)/SMP ratio and alcohol production resulted in a correspondingly lower hydrogen yield. It also proved that a major shift in metabolic pathways for hydrogen production with the C. beijerinckii Fanp3 attributed to the variation of temperatures, i.e., from solvent production to acids. The result is quite consistent with the studies conducted by Lee et al. [21]."
16,Energy analysis,"3.7 Energy analysis In this study, the maximum yield of hydrogen from glucose using C. beijerinckii Fanp3 was 2.52mol/mol-glucose. Assuming overall efficiency of fuel cell as 80%, Gibbs free energy of hydrogen as 56.7kcal/mol, the lower heating values of hydrogen and glucose as 58.3 and 686kcal/mol, respectively, following energy analysis was done. Energy recovery from substrate = 2.52 × 58.3 686 × 100 = 21.4 % Final conversion efficiency = 56.7 × 2.52 × 0.8 686 × 100 = 16.7 % However, the energy recovery obtained in this study using C. beijerinckii Fanp3 was found to be lesser as compared to that obtained by recombinant E. coli BL21 (energy recovery 26.68%) [13]."
17,Dynamics of hydrogen fermentation by C. beijerinckii Fanp3,"3.8 Dynamics of hydrogen fermentation by C. beijerinckii Fanp3 So far, the characteristics of C. beijerinckii in hydrogen production have not been well studied. Fig. 8 demonstrated the time course profiles and characteristics of hydrogen fermentation of C. beijerinckii Fanp3. The optimized fermentative medium containing 10g/L glucose, 4g/L urea, 0.5g/L l-cysteine·HCl·H2O, 0.1g/L FeSO4·7H2O, 0.1g/L MgCl2, 10ml/L mineral salt solution, 10ml/L vitamin solution and 0.15M phosphate buffer was used. The initial pH and temperature were 6.47 and 35°C, respectively. With the modified Gompertz equation, P s and R m were estimated as 255.7mL/g-glucose and 39.0mL/g-glucose h−1, respectively. Hydrogen production began immediately after a short lag phase of 3.0h and the hydrogen production rate maintained a high level at 4–12h, where cell growth had entered exponential growth stage. Exponential cell growth was observed from the beginning, and the final cell density was estimated to be 0.77g/L. Hence, hydrogen production by C. beijerinckii Fanp3 is primarily a growth-coupled process. The hydrogen content in the biogas increased sharply since the onset of hydrogen production and reached a maximum of 50.2% after cultivation for 28h. The amount of SMP increased sharply with hydrogen production and reached a top value of 1.9309g/L at the stationary phase. The medium pH dropped significantly from 6.47 to 4.95 in the first 20h and then kept steady at about 4.92 correspondingly with hydrogen production and formation of acidic metabolites. It obviously shows that the residual glucose declined gradually as fermentation proceeded, and the hydrogen yield based on substrate consumption was 268.9mL/g-glucose. The hydrogen production capability of C. beijerinckii Fanp3 was compared with that of some other fermentative hydrogen-producing microorganisms (Table 4 ). Due to the drastic differences in reactor, substrate, and other process conditions, it is difficult to compare hydrogen yield and hydrogen production rate. Nevertheless, we can conclude that the characteristic values of hydrogen production with C. beijerinckii Fanp3 are generally similar to or better than most other hydrogen-producing strains."
18,Conclusion,"In the present study, a newly bacterium exhibiting excellent hydrogen production efficiency was successfully isolated and identified as C. beijerinckii Fanp3. The bacterium could utilize different carbon sources to produce hydrogen, which indicates that it has the potential of converting renewable wastes into hydrogen. Various types of nitrogen sources could be utilized excellently for efficient hydrogen production, whereas urea was selected because of its relatively low price and easy practice for industrial application. The optimal initial pH was 6.47–6.98, and the application of 0.15M phosphate as buffer could improve the overall performance of C. beijerinckii Fanp3 in hydrogen production. Culture temperature of 35°C was established to be the most favorable for maximum rate of hydrogen production. The distribution of SMP was also greatly affected by temperature. The maximal hydrogen yield and the hydrogen production rate were 2.52mol/mol-glucose and 39.0mL/g-glucose h−1, respectively, which were comparable to several high hydrogen producers reported in the literature. It can be concluded that C. beijerinckii Fanp3 is an ideal candidate for the fermentative hydrogen production."
