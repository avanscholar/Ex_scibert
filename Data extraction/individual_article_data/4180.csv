0,Introduction,"The addiction of humanity to fossil fuels has led to enormous emissions of harmful gases, and thus, to the problem of global warming and climate change. One of the main factors that exacerbates this inevitable problem is the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The global average concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has hit a new record during the last two years at 407 ppm and is predicted to reach 600 ppm till the upcoming century [1]. Therefore, it is urgent to develop novel processes in order to suppress the alarming increase of CO2 in the atmosphere and to simultaneously prevent CO2 from re-entering the carbon cycle. One of the most investigated sustainable methods, which has attracted the interest of the scientific community both as a potential source of renewable fuels and as a mean of reducing carbon dioxide emissions is the catalytic reaction of CO2 hydrogenation. The hydrogenation of CO2 remains one of the most intriguing and effective way to face the continuous increase of CO2 emissions, while at the same time a hydrogenation process could be an effective route for added value products formation. At the beginning of the previous century, Sabatier and Senderens [2] were the first who observed the production of methane after CO2 hydrogenation on a reduced nickel catalyst at 250 °C. During the last decades, the majority of the studies concerning the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 has been carried out in fixed-bed reactors using catalysts based on noble metals (i.e. Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt) [3–11]. Various products, depending on the metal-based catalyst used and on operating reaction conditions, are observed, such as methane, carbon monoxide, higher hydrocarbons, methanol, dimethyl ether, higher alcohols, formic acid and formamides [12–19]. Consequently, the CO2 hydrogenation reaction can offer in addition to the deterrence of CO2 emissions, the production of useful chemicals and fuels. Ruthenium based catalysts have been investigated thoroughly in the past [20–25] for CO2 hydrogenation producing mainly methane and carbon monoxide, according to the following reactions: (1) C O 2 g + H 2 g ↔ C O g + H 2 O g Δ H r , 298 K o = 41.5 k J / m o l (2) C O 2 g + 4 H 2 g ↔ C H 4 g + 2 H 2 O ( g ) Δ H r , 298 K o = − 165.0 k J / m o l The first reaction (eq. (1)), also known as Reverse Water Gas Shift reaction (RWGS) is a mildly endothermic reaction and is thermodynamically favored at higher temperatures. Carbon monoxide, the main product of this reaction is very useful in many industrial processes such as the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis [26–28], and processes that require syngas as the main reaction mixture [29]. On the other hand, the methanation process (eq. 2), also known as Sabatier reaction, is a strongly exothermic reaction favored at low temperatures. Synthetic natural gas, SNG, can be produced via this route. It is worth noting that the hydrogen required for CO2 hydrogenation could be produced by electrolysis, utilizing renewable or excess of electrical energy [30,31]. The CO2 methanation rate on Ru-based catalysts is much higher than the observed rate on other noble metal-based catalysts, and high turnover frequency numbers are observed [32] resulting in low requirements in metal loadings and therefore economically feasible catalytic systems. The CO2 methanation mechanism has not been clarified yet, since different intermediate species are possible to be produced, depending on the metal, the type of the support or even the reaction operating conditions [31]. Until today, two are the most well accepted mechanisms for CO2 hydrogenation to methane. The first one involves the direct dissociation of CO2 to adsorbed CO* and O* and further to O* and C*, which are finally hydrogenated to H2O and CH4, respectively [33–37]. The species involved in this mechanism were detected by spectroscopic techniques, including Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transformed Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) [38], and Raman Spectroscopy [39]. The second alternative mechanism is the so called hydrogen-assisted mechanism [40–43]. In this case, the adsorbed hydrogen (derived from the dissociative adsorption of H2 from the gaseous phase [25]) reacts with the adsorbed CO2*, producing surface formates (e.g. COOH* or HCOO*) and/or formyl adspecies (CHxO) [23], followed by CH*, CO* and/or COH*/HCO* formation, with further dissociation to OH* and C* or CH*. These species are finally hydrogenated to produce methane and water [37]. The latter mechanism was supported by Infrared Spectroscopy [21,40] and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy [42,44]. Electrochemical Promotion of Catalysis (EPOC), also known as Non-Faradaic Electrochemical Modification of Catalytic Activity (NEMCA) has been applied to more than 100 catalytic systems in order to improve the catalytic activity of conductive films deposited on solid electrolytes [23–25,45–49]. EPOC has been also investigated in aqueous phase reactions [50–52] while it has been successfully applied to improve the performance of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCS) and Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs), via triode operation [53–58]. Under electropromoted conditions, both the activity and selectivity of conductive metal or metal-oxide catalytic films deposited on various solid electrolytes can be modified in a very pronounced, reversible and predictable manner [45,59–61]. Application of a constant potential or current between a catalyst (working electrode) and an inert conductive counter electrode, both deposited on a solid electrolyte, can lead to ion migration, originating from the solid electrolyte, to the catalytic surface. These ions form an effective double layer, adjusting the work function and thus the chemisorption properties of the catalyst. For example, in the case of YSZ, application of positive potential results in O2− migration from the solid electrolyte to the metal-gas mixture interface through the three phase boundaries (tpb). These ionic species, accompanied by their compensating charge in the metal, form an effective electrochemical double layer, which affects the catalytic activity by modifying the work function of the metal (i.e. working electrode catalytic film) and thus the chemisorptive energy of the reactants and intermediates. In this way, the coverage of the reactants on the catalytic surface is modified and as a result, the catalytic rate increases or decreases according to the kinetics of the reaction. The EPOC phenomenon can be quantified using three parameters, i.e. the rate enhancement ratio, ρ, defined by eq. (3), the apparent Faradaic efficiency, Λ, defined by eq. (4) and the conversion enhancement index (CEI) (used for the first time in this study) defined by eq. (5): (3) ρ = r r o (4) Λ = Δ r ( I / F ) (5) C E I = X i − X i o X i o % In the above equations, r is the electropromoted catalytic rate, ro is the unpromoted rate (i.e. the open-circuit catalytic rate), Δr is the observed change in the catalytic rate (in g-eq/s) under potential, UCAT, or current, I, application between the working and counter electrode and F is the Faraday constant (96485 C/mol). In addition, Xi expresses the conversion of the reactant i under polarization (electropromoted state), whereas X i o is the conversion of the reactant i under open-circuit conditions. In this study, CO2 was selected as the reactant species for the CEI calculation. The rate enhancement ratio, ρ, expresses the increase of the rate during polarization while the Faradaic efficiency, Λ, expresses the number of additional reactant molecules forced to react due to the introduction of one molecule of the promotional species (e.g. O2− in the case of YSZ) on the catalytically active surface. It is worth noting that the Faradaic efficiency, Λ, is a parameter of great importance when the promoting species can potentially take part in the reaction (e.g. O2− during an oxidation reaction or H+ during a hydrogenation reaction) acting actually as sacrificial promoters, according to the sacrificial promoter mechanism [45]). The conversion enhancement index (CEI) demonstrates the percentage increase of the CO2 conversion under electropromoted conditions. Although there are several studies in the literature reporting the electropromotion of CO2 hydrogenation, almost all of them were carried out in laboratory scale reactors using small in size (1 – 2 cm2) anionic (yttria stabilized zirconia, YSZ) [23,24,46] and cationic (β″-Al2O3, BZY) [24,25,47–49] conductors. The majority of them discuss the electropromotion of Ru-based catalysts and their common conclusion is that the methanation reaction follows electrophobic (or nucleophilic) behavior (i.e. CH4 production rate increases with anodic overpotential) while the RWGS reaction exhibits electrophilic (or nucleophobic) behavior (i.e. the CO production rate increases with cathodic overpotential). In the present study, the CO2 hydrogenation was studied in a Monolithic Electrochemically Promoted Reactor (MEPR) loaded with 9 Ru/YSZ/Au plates, all connected in parallel (Fig. 1 ). The MEPR can be considered as a hybrid between a classical monolithic honeycomb reactor and a flat- or ribbed-plate solid oxide fuel cell. Contrary to the case of fuel cells, where the fuel and air gas streams are kept separated, in the case of MEPR there is only one gas stream containing all reactants and products, as in a classical catalytic reactor. The MEPR is a simple reactor which can be assembled and dismantled easily and with only two external connecting wires permits the easy practical utilization of electrochemical promotion [62]. Consequently, considering the fact that fuels (e.g. methane, methanol, gasoline) account for 30 % of the total CO2 emissions [63] there is a great incentive to switch from laboratory studies to practical application and indeed, there seems to exist a significant promise in the selective electropromotion of CO2 hydrogenation."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of Ru/YSZ/Au cells,"2.1 Preparation of Ru/YSZ/Au cells The solid electrolytes components, provided by Kerafol, were square plates of 8 mol % Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) with thickness of 0.3 mm and dimensions of 50 mm x 50 mm (Fig. 2 a). The deposition of the Au counter electrodes on the one side of the electrolyte plates was carried out via DC magnetron sputtering. The YSZ plates were initially introduced into a sputtering chamber, filled with pure argon, and then metal (Au 99.99 %) was deposited onto the substrate at 30◦C. The sputtering conditions were the following: direct current (DC) mode with a discharge of 500 V, argon pressure of 0.4 Pa. Under these conditions and 10 min deposition time the total Au loading was 1.2 mg/cm2. The electrical conductivity of the prepared Au counter electrode was high at ambient conditions (ohmic resistance equal to 0.1 Ω/cm2). The Ru catalyst films were deposited on the other side of the discs, via impregnation of a 150 mM RuCl3 (Alfa Aesar) solution in isopropanol at 50 °C, followed by calcination in air at 500 °C for 1 h. The resulting total mass of the catalyst film was 9−10 mg per cell with a loading of approximately 0.44 mg/cm2. Blank experiments showed that gold was catalytically inactive both for the methanation and the RWGS reaction. It is worth noting that the stability of the catalysts (both in terms of catalytic activity and selectivity) was remarkable since the results were fully reproducible (with deviation below 0.5 %) even after 6 months of experimentation."
3,MEP reactor operation,"2.2 MEP reactor operation The configuration of the MEP reactor was proposed in 2004 [62] in an effort to develop a semi-pilot type reactor for EPOC studies without problems related to expensive thick catalytic films with low metal dispersion (< 0.01 %) and inefficient and complex reactor designs like those used in laboratory scale experiments. The above limitations can be overcome via the use of thin sputtered noble metal electrodes with metal dispersion exceeding 15 % deposited on flat or ribbed plates able to be replaced whenever necessary. Their specific connection, analyzed in detail elsewhere [62], allows all the catalyst films to be electrochemically promoted via only two external connecting wires. Furthermore, one of the plates can be used as a gas-sensor element and utilize the potential signal generated by this element, under open circuit or at a fixed current, to control the current or potential applied to the electropromoted catalytic plates. The first generation of MEPR was used successfully to study the reactions of ethylene oxidation and NO reduction by C2H4 in presence of O2 [49,62]. The design and specifications of the MEPR, used in this study, are shown in Fig. 1. The reactor was placed in a tubular furnace and its temperature was measured and controlled via a type K thermocouple embedded in the metal casing at a distance of 1 mm from the gas mixture entrance (Fig. 2c). In order to accomplish uniform temperature in the reactor under high reactant flowrates, a pre-heater was placed in front of the furnace entrance. The feed gas composition and total flowrate, FT, were controlled by three mass flowmeters (Brooks instrument, SLA 5800 series). Reactants were commercial compressed gases, provided by Linde Hellas, with certified standards of 5.0 % CO2 in He and 15.0 % H2 in He. The total flowrate and inlet gas composition were adjusted (at the desired levels, FT = 500-2500 cm3/min) by using pure He (99.999 %) feed through the third flowmeter. All the experiments were performed at ambient pressure and in the temperature range between 220 °C–370 °C. Before any experiment, a reduction pretreatment step with 15 % H2 in He was performed at 380 °C for 3 h. Reactants and products were analyzed by on-line gas chromatography (Chromatec Analytic GC-2018) in conjunction with an infrared gas analyzer CO2−CO−CH4-O2 (Fuji Electric, ZRE-3). Constant currents and potentials were applied using an AMEL 2053 galvanostat–potentiostat. All the experiments were repeated at least twice with a deviation of less than 5%."
4,Results,"The steady-state effect of the total gas mixture flowrate at T = 370 °C and constant feed composition on the CH4 and CO formation catalytic reactions both under open-circuit and imposed potential conditions, is shown in Fig. 3 . Both catalytic rates initially increase, while the rate of the CH4 formation reaction is reaching a plateau for flowrate values higher than 1000 cm3/min. In this region, the total rate of CO2 consumption (Fig. 4 ) increases only slightly with flowrate, indicating that the mass transfer limitation phenomena are limited. Based on these results, a total gas flowrate equal to 1000 cm3/min was selected for the rest of the catalytic/electrocatalytic experiments with flowrate, the conversion of carbon dioxide XCO2, was approximately 30 % under open-circuit conditions (Fig. 4 bottom), while upon a positive polarization of 2.5 V, XCO2 rose to 37 %. Thus, for the case of 1000 cm3/min the conversion enhancement index (CEI) was 23 % (Fig. 4). Although the CO2 conversions are quite high (15–45 %) under open circuit conditions, over the entire range of the flowrates, significant values of conversion enhancement index (CEI), up to 25 %, were observed under anodic polarization. Fig. 5 shows the effect of the flowrate on the selectivity to CH4 and CO. Under open-circuit conditions, the selectivity to CH4 takes its higher value at 300 cm3/min and decreases down to 65 % at the highest flowrate of 2500 cm3/min. On the other hand, the selectivity to CO increases with flowrate (10 % and 35 % at 300 cm3/min and 2500 cm3/min respectively). Positive potential application (+2.5 V) results in 15–20 % increase of the selectivity to CH4 while negative polarization has the opposite effect regardless of the value of the flowrate. In contrast, the selectivity to CO is favored upon negative potential application (-2.5 V) and decreases (15–20 %) upon anodic polarization. The variation of the selectivity with flowrate can be explained by considering the real ratio of the reactants at every flowrate value (considered equal to the ratio at the outlet of the reactor). Although the PH2/PCO2 ratio is always 7 at the entrance of the reactor, the conversion of CO2, as shown in Fig. 4 (bottom right) is much higher at low flowrate (∼50 % at 300 cc/min) than at high flowrate (∼15 % at 2500 cc/min). Taking into account that hydrogen is always in excess, the smaller the flowrate, the higher is the actual average PH2/PCO2 ratio in the reactor, which approaches the reactor entrance value (i.e. 7) only at high flowrate values and small conversions of CO2 (Fig. 6 ). Based on the previously published kinetics of CO2 hydrogenation, on Ru/YSZ catalysts in single pellet reactors [23,24], methanation is favored at high PH2/PCO2 ratios while RWGS reaction is favored at low PH2/PCO2 ratios. Therefore, one expects higher selectivity to methane at 300 cc/min than 2500 cc/min and vice versa higher selectivity to carbon monoxide at 2500 cc/min than 300 cc/min, which indeed is the case as shown in Fig. 5. The same trend is observed in the yield of each product which is shown in Fig. 7 . Under open-circuit conditions, the yield to methane, YCH4, starts from high values (42 %) and decreases by increasing the flowrate while YCO is almost stable with values close to 6% regardless of the value of the flowrate. More specifically, under low flowrate values (300 or 500 cm3/min) the yield to methane (YCH4) is one order of magnitude higher than the yield of carbon monoxide (YCO). Upon positive potential application (+2.5 V), YCH4 increases by approximately 30 %, depending on the value of the flowrate. The higher the flowrate, the lower the effect of the anodic polarization. The opposite behavior is observed for YCO which is favored under cathodic polarization (increase up to 1 unit). In the specific flowrate value of 1000 cm3/min, there is a 45 % increase of the yield to CH4 (from 23 % to 33 %) and similar decrease of the yield to CO (from 6% to 3.3 %). The effect of the total gas mixture flowrate on the faradaic efficiency values, Λ, and the rate enhancement ratio, ρ, at T = 370 °C and reducing conditions (PCO2/PH2 = 1/7) is shown in Fig. 8 . Interestingly, the ρ and Λ values, both for methane and carbon monoxide are almost constant for flowrate values higher than 1000 cm3/min. The Faradaic efficiency for CH4 is close to 5 and -5 under positive (+2.5 V) and negative (-2.5 V) polarization, respectively, while the corresponding values for CO are very low (between 0 and 0.5) in both cases. The same behavior is observed with the rate enhancement ratio values of CH4 and CO. Under positive polarization (+2.5 V) there is a constant 40–50 % increase (ρCH4 = 1.4–1.5) on the catalytic rate of CH4 for all the studied flowrates which is more or less expected, due to the high CO2 conversion under open circuit conditions (15–45 %, Fig. 4). On the other hand, the rate enhancement ratio of CO is constant at 0.6 (ρCO = 0.6). The opposite behavior is observed by applying negative potential (-2.5 V), with a constant 20 % decrease of the CH4 formation catalytic rate (ρCH4 = 0.8) and a constant 30 % increase of the CO formation catalytic rate (ρCO = 1.3). In general, the methanation reaction follows an electrophobic (or nucleophilic) behavior while the RWGS reaction exhibits purely electrophilic (nucleophobic) behavior in agreement with previous studies of CO2 hydrogenation on Ru-based catalysts in laboratory scale reactors [23–25,47,48]. Fig. 9 shows the open- and closed-circuit light-off curves of the reactor at a volumetric flowrate of 1000 cm3/min and reducing (PCO2/PH2 = 1/7) conditions. More specifically, the effect is shown of temperature on the carbon monoxide and methane formation catalytic rates, as well as on the carbon dioxide consumption and conversion under open-circuit and electropromoted conditions (±2.5 V). Due to the high conversions, the operating temperature range for electropromotion at this flowrate is limited to temperatures below 370 °C. Fig. 9 illustrates that under open-circuit conditions, increasing temperature causes an increase in the overall carbon dioxide consumption rate, up to 22 × 10−7 mol/s and a conversion up to 28.5 % at 370 °C. A significant increase in the CO2 conversion is achieved under positive catalyst polarization of +2.5 V (from 28.5% to 35%), while in the case of negative potential application (-2.5 V) a decrease is observed (from 28.5% to 25.1%). In the same figure, the catalytic rate of methane formation starts at 240 °C. On the other hand, the CO production appears at higher temperatures (after 300 °C) with catalytic rates of one order of magnitude lower than those of CH4 formation. This behavior is in agreement with the thermodynamic analysis of CO2 hydrogenation according to which the methanation reaction is favored at low temperatures, whereas the RWGS reaction is favored at higher temperatures [64]. The promotional effect is pronounced at temperature higher than 320oC due to the increased ionic conductivity of the electrolyte and thus due to the high mobility of oxygen ion promoters. Fig. 10 shows the selectivity to CH4 and CO as a function of the operating temperature for open-circuit and for polarization conditions (±2.5 V). For temperatures up to 300 °C, methane is the dominant product of the reaction. Although selectivity to methane decreases gradually with temperature down to 84 % at 370 °C, it can be successfully enhanced with positive polarization up to 92 %. On the other hand, negative polarization results to a decrease from 84 to 73 %. The opposite effect is observed in the behavior of the CO selectivity, as shown in Fig. 10. Utilizing the experimental data of Figs. 9 and 10 we can follow the effect of temperature on the reaction yield (Fig. 11 ). The maximum yield to methane, YCH4, and carbon monoxide, YCO, observed under open circuit conditions, are 24 % and 5% respectively at 370 °C. These values can be enhanced to 32 % (YCH4, via anodic polarization) and 7% (YCO, via cathodic polarization) or decreased to 18 % (YCH4, via cathodic polarization) and 3% (YCO, via anodic polarization). Fig. 12 shows a continuous anodic and cathodic potentiostatic transient (i.e. O2− supply to the catalyst and O2− removal from the catalyst) obtained at 370 °C with a total gas flowrate of 1000 cm3/min under reducing feed composition (PCO2/PH2 = 1/7), starting with a CO2 conversion exceeding 28 % and a carbon dioxide consumption rate value close to 22 × 10−7 mol/sec. This rate increases under constant potential application of +2.5 V reaching a new steady state with a rate enhancement ratio, ρ, for CO2 close to 1.3, indicating a 30 % increase of the overall carbon dioxide consumption rate. The CO2 conversion at the promoted state is 35 %. During the positive potential application, there is a 40 % increase of the methanation reaction rate (ρCH4 = 1.4) and at the same time a 30 % decrease of the RWGS reaction rate (ρCO = 0.7). The faradaic efficiency, Λ, values were found to be 4.2 and -0.2 for the CH4 and CO, respectively. The observed increase in the methanation rate upon positive polarization can be rationalized by the catalyst work function increase, induced by the supplied O δ − promoting species to the catalytic surface and the establishment of an effective double layer on the gas-exposed Ru surface [45]. The latter results in strengthening of the Ru−H (electron donor species) and weakening of the Ru − CHxO (electron acceptor species) bond strength and thus, in an increase in the H/CHxO coverage ratio value (i.e., θH/θCHxO), which favors the methanation reaction and suppresses the RWGS reaction. The term “CHxO” corresponds to all possible oxygen-containing intermediate compounds formed by CO2 dissociation (x = 0, 1, 2). After current interruption, the catalytic rates of both reactions return to their initial values. This can be attributed to consumption of the promoting ionic species (O δ − or OHζ−) present on the catalytic surface by hydrogen. In contrast, negative polarization, that is, O δ − pumping from the catalyst surface, causes a decrease in the catalyst work function and a subsequent weakening of the Ru−H and strengthening of the Ru − CHxO bond strength, which decreases the θH/θCHxO ratio value and favors the RWGS reaction. During the negative polarization, there is a 40 % increase of the RWGS reaction rate (ρCO = 1.4) and at the same time a 20 % decrease of the methanation reaction rate (ρCH4 = 0.8). The faradaic efficiency, Λ, values were found to be 0.3 and -2.6 for the CO and CH4, respectively. Turnover frequencies (TOFs) of CO2, CH4 and CO were calculated using the experimental values of the catalytic rates and the reactive oxygen uptake, NG, which corresponds to the catalytic active surface under the conditions of Fig. 12. The reactive oxygen uptake, NG, was estimated using the relaxation time constant, τ, which is the time required for the methane reaction formation rate to reach the 63 % of its final value after positive polarization [45] according to the following equation: (6) τ = 2 F N G I where I is the observed current at the new steady state after potential application. Several transient experiments (at 370 °C and UCAT = 2.5 V) under various PCO2/PH2 ratios were used for the calculation of NG. The results are shown in Fig. 13 . Since the NG values are independent of the PCO2/PH2 ratios, the mean value of 2.6 × 10−5 mol O was used for the calculation of the turnover frequencies shown in Fig. 12. The aforementioned values for TOFCO2, are very close to those observed in the literature for this temperature range [32,65]. The effect of the applied potential on the catalytic rates and the selectivity to methane and CO, under reducing conditions, at 370 °C is shown in Fig. 14 . The Methane selectivity follows a monotonic increase with applied potential, taking values very close to 100 % for anodic overpotentials. The opposite behavior is observed for the RWGS reaction, where the selectivity to carbon monoxide is higher for negative applied potentials, with a maximum value of 32 % at -2.5 V. The consumption rate and conversion of CO2, which is the result of the two parallel reactions of methanation and RWGS, is strongly affected by the applied potential showing a plateau at high positive potential values. The effect of the applied potential on the ρ and Λ values is shown in Fig. 15 . The rate enhancement ratio of methane, ρCH4, varies from 0.65 to 1.8 as the potential increases from -2.5 V to 2.5 V. On the other hand, the rate enhancement ratio, ρCO, shows opposite behavior and varies between 1.3 to 0.2 as the potential increases at the same range. The faradaic efficiency, ΛCH4, for the methanation reaction varies between -30 and 11 while that of RWGS reaction, ΛCO, takes values between -0.8 and 2.3. Although the qualitative features of electropromotion (electrophobic behavior for methanation reaction and electrophilic behavior for RWGS reaction) remain the same, the measured ρ and Λ values in our study is almost the half and one order of magnitude lower, respectively, in comparison to those measured for the same reactions studied using thicker (due to the higher loading, 2−4 mg/cm2) Ru-based catalysts in laboratory scale single pellet reactors [23–25,47,48]. The smaller ρ values are certainly due to the high reactant conversions of the present study. Thus, obviously, when the open-circuit (unpromoted) reactant conversion is of the order of 33 %, the maximum possible ρ value is 3. The smaller measured Λ values are possibly due to the lower polarizability of our samples due to the lower loading and thus to the thinner Ru electrodes. However they are of the same order of magnitude as those predicted by Eq. (7), valid for oxidation reactions [45], where ro is the open-circuit rate (∼1.85 × 10−6 mol/s, Fig. 14) and Io is the exchange current (∼20 mA at 370 °C, Fig. 15). (7) Λ t h = 2 F r o I o The small difference between the experimental Λ values and Λth most likely manifests the short life-time of the promoting O2− species on the catalyst surface, as a result of the reducing environment."
5,Conclusions,"The CO2 hydrogenation was studied in a monolithic electropromoted reactor under high flowrates of reactants, up to 2500 cm3/min. Under reducing (PCO2/PH2 = 1/7) and open circuit conditions, the selectivity to CH4 was 100 % at temperatures up to 300 °C. Although selectivity to methane decreases gradually with temperature down to 84 % (at 370 °C), it can be successfully enhanced with positive polarization up to 92 %. Under electropromoted conditions (2.5 V) the maximum observed yield to methane was 32 % at 370 °C. In general, the methanation reaction follows an electrophobic (or nucleophilic) behavior (i.e. CH4 production rate increases with anodic overpotentials) while the RWGS reaction exhibits electrophilic (or nucleophobic) behavior (i.e. the CO production rate increases with cathodic overpotentials). All the results are in agreement with previous studies on CO2 hydrogenation in laboratory scale reactors which proves that the scale up of EPOC via MEPR operation is feasible. The successful electropromoted performance under severe operating conditions in a reactor (MEPR), which is suitable for scale up, is a promising step for the practical utilization of electrochemical promotion of catalysis."
