0,Introduction,"As a renewable and clean energy source, hydrogen (H2) has become a research hotspot due to the increasingly prominent energy crisis and environmental problems. Photocatalysis as a method to prepare renewable clean H2 energy has entered in human sight since 1972.1-2 Nowadays, more and more photocatalysts were used for H2 generation, such as TiO2,3-5 ZnO, 6-8 CuO,9-11 CdS,12,13 and g-C3N4.14-16 Among them, CdS has become a widely studied photocatalyst because of its suitable bandgap width (∼2.4 eV)17. Recently, wang et al. synthesize a ternary CdS@h-BN/rGO catalyst via a structural reconstruction strategy18, the research showed that the electrons on the valence band of h-BN could easily transfer to the CdS active centers under photoinduction for the formation of CdS@h-BN heterointerface, which overcomes the wide bandgap defect of h-BN. However, due to the low electron mobility and the easy recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes of CdS, the problems of a poor photocatalytic H2 production performance and its photo-corrosivity still exist. In general, the loading co-catalyst on photocatalysts is regarded as an effective strategy to improve the photocatalytic H2 production performance.19-21 The co-catalysts not only captured the photogenerated electrons produced from the photocatalysts to inhibit carrier combination22,23, but also provided the abundant active sites for H2 production24,25. While for the limitation of photo-corrosion of CdS, a hole scavengers with a higher redox potential (such as SO3 2-, ∼ –3.0 eV) is needed to inhibit the self photo-corrosion of sulfide photocatalysts, so as to improve the photocatalytic stability. The photo-corrosion phenomenon was because that the narrow bandgap of CdS photocatalysts caused that the S in CdS was easy to be oxidized by both the photogenerated holes and small amount of dissolved oxygen in the dispersion solution. The utilization of SO3 2- with a higher redox potential can preferentially react with the photogenerated holes to avoid the oxidation of CdS. However, it was noting that the continue adding of scavengers was needed to maintain the stability of CdS. Thus, how to improve the photo-corrosion resistance of CdS by constructing composite structure has an important research significance26-28. For instance, Lu et al. reported the strategy to improve photocorrosion resistance properties of CdS by constructing CdS@Ni2P29 and CdS@Al2O3 30. This composite structure could significantly inhibit the nascent formed oxygen induced photo-corrosion and improve the stability of CdS during photocatalytic hydrogen evolution31-33. As we known, the highly active electrocatalysts, such as noble metals34 and non-precious metals21 and used as the co-catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen production were widely reported because the electronic structure of those co-catalysts facilitate the decomposition of water to H2 with a low kinetic activation barrier35. TaS2 with lateral S active sites was reported as a kinds of high efficiency electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution36,37, which could be used as co-catalysts for photocatalysis38. In this work, the CdS nanospheres decorated with S-doped Ta2O5 nanoparticles (S-Ta2O5/CdS) was designed and synthesized via the interfacial diffusion reaction between CdS and Ta2O5 at high calcination temperature. In this system, CdS nanosphere acted as a visible light photocatalyst, and S-Ta2O5 serve as co-catalyst to provide the hydrogen production active sites, which significantly improved the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. More importantly, the decorated S-doped Ta2O5 nanoparticles on the surface of CdS nanosphere via interfacial diffusion reaction could effectively improve the photo-corrosion resistance of CdS core. This work offers a new perspective that S-Ta2O5 improves the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pair and photo-corrosion resistance for the visible light photocatalytic hydrogen production."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals All the reagents in this work were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. Tantalum chloride (TaCl5) was purchased from Maclin, the cadmium acetate (Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O), thioacetamide (CH3CSNH2), sodium sulfite (Na2SO3, AR), sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S·9H2O, AR), and ethyl alcohol absolute (C2H5OH) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagents Beijing Co., Ltd."
3,Preparation of S doped Ta2O5 shell coating CdS nanosphere,"2.2 Preparation of S doped Ta2O5 shell coating CdS nanosphere The cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanospheres were prepared by the hydrothermal reaction. 30 ml of a mixed aqueous solution of Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O (2.4 mmol) and thiourea (24 mmol) were vigorously stirred to form a uniformly dispersed suspension, and then transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with 50 mL volume and heated at 160 oC for 4 h. The obtained CdS nanospheres were collected after filtering and washing with ethanol and water for several times. The amorphous tantalum oxide gel was coated on the surface of prepared CdS nanospheres by sol-gel method. Typically, 0.15 g CdS nanospheres were evenly dispersed in 25 ml of anhydrous ethanol solution, then, 36.28 mg TaCl5 (0.1 mmol) was added into the above solution and stirred for 10 min. After that, the dispersion was put in a 50 ml autoclave, and heated at 200 oC for 4 h. Then, centrifugal washing for several times with deionized water and ethanol was performed to obtain CdS nanospheres@amorphous TaOx (CdS@A-TaOx). The obtained samples were then annealed at 800 oC, 900 oC, 1000 oC, respectively, with a heating rate of 5 oC min-1 in Ar for 2 h to get the final products, which were denoted as S-Ta2O5/CdS, CdS/CdO2/S-Ta2O5 and CdO2/S-Ta2O5, respectively. For comparison, the thickness of the Ta2O5 shell was adjusted by changing the amount of TaCl5 (0.05mmol, 0.1mmol, 0.2mmol, 0.3mmol). Pure Ta2O5 nanoparticles were synthesized by a similar process without adding CdS nanospheres. The S doped Ta2O5 nanoparticles were synthesized by calcining the pure Ta2O5 nanoparticles at 800 oC for 2 h under 10% H2S/Ar atmosphere. The 5 wt% Pt loading on CdS nanospheres (CdS@5 wt% Pt) were synthesized by photo-reduction according to references.39"
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Cu Ka radiation in the range of 20o ≤ 2θ ≤ 60o at room temperature (ThermoFisher, ARL Equinox 3000X) was used to determine the crystal structures of the as-prepared samples. The morphologies of the samples were characterized by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV and a field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Regulus 8100). The differential thermal and thermal gravimetric (TGA-DSC) curves were detected by the thermal analyzer (Mettler-Toledo) at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 in a stream of air (50 mL min−1). UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV2550, Shimadzu, Japan) was used to obtain the UV-visible diffused reflectance spectra of the samples with BaSO4 as a reflectance standard. The bandgap energy was obtained by the followed formular40: (F(R)hν)1/n = B(hν - Eg) Where where F(R), Eg, hν and A are the absorption coefficient, band gap, the photonic energy and a constant, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were obtained to determine the structure of samples by an ESCALab220i-XL electron spectrometer from VG Scientific using 300 W Al KR radiation. The C 1s line at 284.5 eV was used as reference in the binding energies. The Photoluminescence (PL) was acquired using microscopic Raman spectrometer (HORIBA LabRAM HR Evolution) with a laser of 532 nm at room temperature. The N2 adsorption−desorption isotherms of samples were detected by using Pierre Kubox 2000 specific surface aperture analyser (kubo-x2000). The corresponding specific surface area and pore-size distributions was obtained from isotherms based on the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) model and the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) theory. The band structure was analyzed by measuring the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). The work function (ϕ) can be determined by the difference between the photon energy and the binding energy of the secondary cutoff edge. A sample bias of −5 V was applied to observe the secondary electron cutoff (SEC). The valance band (VB) spectra were measured with a monochromatic He I light source (21.2 eV) and a VG Scienta R4000 analyzer."
5,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"2.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions were carried out in a closed quartz round-bottom flask. 5 mg of the obtained catalysts were dispersed in 100 ml aqueous solution composed of 0.25 M Na2SO3 and 0.35 M Na2S by stirring and dispersing evenly. In order to remove the air in the flask, the solution was bubbled with nitrogen for 30 min before irradiation. During the photocatalytic reaction, 300 W xenon lamp with a filter (> 420 nm) was used as the light source, and the distance from the reactor was 10 cm, giving a power density of 226 mW·cm-2, and a cooling water device was used to control the reaction temperature at around 26 oC. H2 generated by photocatalytic reaction was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-7900, CEAULIGHT, China, TCD, nitrogen as a carrier gas and 5 Å molecular sieve column). The apparent quantum efficiency (AQY) was defined by the following equation and was measured using a 300 W xenon arc lamp equipped with an irradiatometer:41 A Q Y % = n u m b e r o f r e a c t e d e l e c t r o n s n u m b e r o f i n c i d e n t p h o t o n s × 100 % = n u m b e r o f e v o l v e d H 2 m o l e c u l e s × 2 n u m b e r o f i n c i d e n t p h o t o n s × 100 % = 2 × n H 2 × N A P S t λ / h c × 100 % Wherein, the NA is the Avogadro's constant (6.02×1023 mol-1); the nH2 is the molar of generated hydrogen per hour; h is the Planck constant (6.626 ×10−34 J s); c is the speed of light (3×108 m s−1); P is the power of Xenon lamp at 420 nm (90.1 mW/cm2); S is the active area under irradiation light (38.48 cm2); t is the photocatalytic reaction time (3600 s), λ is the wavelengths (500×10−9 m and 420×10−9 m);."
6,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.5 Photoelectrochemical measurements Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760C, CH Instruments Inc.) with a three-electrode configuration, and 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution was using as the electrolyte. The carbon rod was used as the counter electrode and the Hg/Hg2Cl2 electrode (SCE, saturated KCl aqueous solution) was used as the reference electrode, respectively. For the working electrode, 5 mg catalysts were dispersed in 1 mL of 1:1 (v/v) water/ethanol solution mixed with 50 μL of Nafion solution (5% in alcohols/water solution, Sigma-Aldrich) and sonicated for 30 min. Then the working electrode was obtained by drop-casting 5 μL of the above solution onto the surface of the glassy carbon (GC) electrode. The electrocatalytic HER activity of overpotential was the potential when the current density of 1 mV cm–2."
7,Results and discussion,"The synthesis process as well as the morphology and structural evolution of S doped Ta2O5 nanoparticles decorated CdS nanosphere were illustrated in Scheme 1 and Figure 1 . Firstly, CdS nanospheres with size of ∼500 nm were synthesized by hydrothermal reaction, which were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in Figure 1 a and confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern in Figure 1 e. From the XRD pattern, the characteristic diffraction peaks at 24.8°, 26.5°, 28.2°, 43.7°, 47.8°, 52.8° were attributed to (100), (002), (101), (110), (103), (201) crystal planes of CdS (JCPDS no.77-2306), respectively. Secondly, the amorphous TaOx was coated on the surface of CdS nanospheres (CdS@A-TaOx) by sol-gel method. Excepted for CdS, no other diffraction peaks were detected by XRD pattern in Figure 1 e, indicating the amorphous TaOx shell. Compared with the rough surface of CdS nanospheres, the spherical morphology was maintained but the surface became smooth due to the coating of amorphous TaOx (Figure 1 b). Thirdly, the interfacial diffusion reaction between sublimation of CdS and crystallization of Ta2O5 was carried out via the high-temperature calcination. The differential thermal and thermal gravimetric (TG-DTA) curve in Figure S1 confirmed the sublimation temperature of CdS was about 800 oC. However, the CdS sublimated slowly due to the protection of amorphous TaOx shell. If the tantalum oxide shell was absent, pure CdS nanospheres completely disappeared after the calcination at 800 oC. Therefore, the Ta2O5 nanoparticles with size of 10-50 nm were decorated on CdS sphere by calcining CdS@A-TaOx at 800 oC, and the according SEM image was shown in Figure 1 c. Excepted for CdS, the XRD pattern in Figure 1 e detected the crystalline Ta2O5 with characteristic diffraction peaks at 22.902o attributed to (001) crystal plane (JCPDS no.25-0922). When the calcination temperature reached to 1000 oC, the disappearance of CdS nanosphere was comfirmed by SEM image in Figure 1 d and XRD in Figure 1 e indicating that the CdS completely sublimated at 1000 oC. The yellow CdS powder was observed at the end of furnace. The porous shell composed of Ta2O5 nanoparticles were observed by SEM in Figure 1 d. Besides, the CdO2 phase (JCPDS 78-1125) with diffraction peaks at 29o, 33.7o and 48.4o were detected, due to the partial oxidation of CdS during the calcination at 1000 oC. The obtained CdO2/S-Ta2O5 possessed the high specific surface area of 174.11 cm2/g, which was larger than those of CdS nanospheres (15.38 cm2/g), CdS@A-TaOx (10.03 cm2/g) and S-Ta2O5/CdS (19.78 cm2/g), as shown in Figure S3. The EDX elemental mapping of Cd, Ta, O and S for CdO2/S-Ta2O5 in Figure S2 showed that Ta and O elements possessed the uniform spherical distribution and the Cd and S elements were randomly distributed. In addition, the CdS@A-TaOx-700 and CdS/CdO2@S-Ta2O5 synthesized at 700 oC and 900 oC were also characterized by SEM images and XRD in Figure S4. The morphology and structure of CdS@A-TaOx-700 were similar with CdS@A-TaOx, no crystalline Ta2O5 was detected under this low calcination temperature. The morphology of CdS/CdO2@S-Ta2O5-900 was similar with that of S-Ta2O5/CdS, but the content of CdO2 significantly increased because that more CdS sublimated and were oxidized by Ta2O5. Being consistent with the SEM images, the CdS nanospheres with size of ∼500 nm was observed by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image in the Figure 2 a1. The HRTEM image in Figure 2 a2 displayed the lattice spacing of 0.335 nm, corresponding to the (002) crystal plane of CdS. After the hydrothermal reaction (Figure 2 b1), no other crystal lattices were detected expect for that of CdS, implying the coating amorphous TaOx layer on the surface of CdS (red zone in Figure 2 b2). When the CdS@A-TaOx under the calcination temperature at 800 oC, the abundant Ta2O5 nanoparticles coated CdS nanospheres were observed (Figure 2 c1). From the HRTEM image in Figure 2 c2, the lattice spacing of 0.35 nm on core part and lattice spacing of 0.38 nm on the nanoparticles were detected, which were corresponding to (100) crystal planes of CdS and (001) crystal planes of Ta2O5, respectively. In addition, the element distribution in Figure 2 e also showed that Cd, S, Ta and O elements were evenly distributed in one nanosphere, further confirming the formation of S-Ta2O5/CdS. The higher calcination temperature of 1000 °C was carried out as shown in Figure 2 d. It showed that only the hollow shell structure composed of CdO2/S-Ta2O5 nanoparticles was observed and the CdS nanosphere disappeared. Two kinds of lattice frings with the crystal spacings of 0.38 nm and 0.26 nm attributed to (001) crystal planes of Ta2O5 and (200) crystal planes of CdO2 were present, respectively, indicating the formation of CdO2/S-Ta2O5. X-photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to probe the surface composition and surface valence of CdS, CdS@A-TaOx, S-Ta2O5/CdS and CdO2/S-Ta2O5, as shown in Figure S5 and Figure 3 . In Figure 3 a, CdS nanosphere and CdS@A-TaOx had similar Cd 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 of Cd2+ with characteristic peaks at 411.7 eV and 404.9 eV,42 implying the weak interface between A-TaOx coating layer and the CdS core. After the calcination at 800 oC (S-Ta2O5/CdS), the binding energy of Cd 3d peak negatively shifted for about 0.1 eV compared with those of CdS and CdS@A-TaOx, implying the strong interfacial structure between CdS and Ta2O5, which was in agree with the previous reports43,44. After calcination at 1000 oC (CdO2/S-Ta2O5), the peak intensities of Cd significantly decreased due to the sublimation of CdS and the transformation from CdS to CdO2. The XPS results for S 2p also confirmed the same conclusion with Cd. In Figure 3 b, CdS and CdS@A-TaOx have the same valence state and position at 162.8 eV and 161.6 eV for S 2p5/2. As for S-Ta2O5/CdS, the characteristic peaks of S 2p3/2 begin to shift to low binding energy. As for CdO2/S-Ta2O5, scarcely any S elements was detected due to the sublimation of CdS. In Figure 3 c, compared to that of CdS@A-TaOx with Ta 4f5/2 and Ta 4f7/2 peaks at 27.91 eV and 26.02 eV,45 the Ta 4f peaks for S-Ta2O5/CdS and CdO2/S-Ta2O5 shifted to the low binding energy with a range of about 1 eV and 1.2 eV, respectively, due to the crystallization of Ta2O5 and S doping into Ta2O5. In Figure 3 d, the XPS of O 1s can be separated into two peaks at 530.6 and 531.7 eV corresponding to the bond of Ta-O and the O defect for CdS@A-TaOx.46 After the calcination at 800 °C, the amorphous TaOx was crystallized to Ta2O5, which resulted in that three peaks appeared at 532.8, 531.3 and 529.7 eV, and this was consistent with the previous report for the O 1s XPS peaks of Ta2O5.47,48 For CdO2/S-Ta2O5, only two O 1s peaks were observed, which may be due to the introduction of a large amount of CdO2, the obvious positive shift of O 1s XPS peaks for CdO2/S-Ta2O5 compared with S-Ta2O5/CdS could also confirm the conjecture. All above XPS results gave a signal that the interfacial diffusion reaction between CdS and Ta2O5 occurred during high-temperature calcination and accompanied by the evolution from CdS to CdO2 and evolution from amorphous TaOx to crystalline S doped Ta2O5. In order to study the photocatalytic H2 production activity of S-Ta2O5/CdS, blank samples were synthesized, including the pure Ta2O5 and S doped Ta2O5, and according SEM images and XRD patterns were shown in Figure S6 and S7. UV-vis absorption spectrum was used to measure the light absorption and the band gap of samples. In Figure 4 a and 4b, the S-Ta2O5/CdS with band gap of 2.1 eV possessed the similar light absorption with CdS (2.16 eV), confirming that the decorative S-Ta2O5 nanoparticles on CdS did slightly affect the visible light absorption. The transmittance of Ta2O5 was measured to be close to 90% as shown in Figure S8, which resulted in that most of the irradiated light was absorbed by CdS. As for CdO2/S-Ta2O5, the absorption edge was similar with those of Ta2O5 and S doped Ta2O5. Figure 4 c showed the photocatalytic H2 evolution rates of CdS, CdS@A-TaOx, S-Ta2O5/CdS, CdO2/S-Ta2O5 and S-Ta2O5 under the visible light radiation (> 420 nm). Remarkably, S-Ta2O5/CdS possessed the highest H2 evolution rate of 54.51 μmol·mg–1·h–1, which was approximately thirty-six times more than those of pure CdS (1.51 μmol·mg–1·h–1) and S-Ta2O5 (0 μmol·mg–1·h–1), implying that the synergistic effect of S-Ta2O5 as co-catalysts and CdS as photocatalysts played an important role in enhancing the photocatalytic activity. The according apparent quantum efficiency (AQY) and H2 generation rates of the S-Ta2O5/CdS under different light wavelength (420 nm and 500 nm) were listed in Figure S9, and the AQY of S-Ta2O5/CdS was 9.43% in 420 nm and 21.65% in 500 nm, respectively. The loading amount of Ta2O5 was optimized to obtain the highest photocatalytic hydrogen production performance as shown in Figure S10. As shown, when the used amount of TaCl5 was 0.1 mmol, the formed S-Ta2O5/CdS possessed the highest H2 evolution rate, which may be due to that the suitable amount of the formed S-Ta2O5 was both beneficial to the light absorption of CdS and co-catalytic action of S-Ta2O5. In addition, the CdS@A-TaOx-700 and CdS/CdO2@S-Ta2O5 were also prepared to confirm the effects of calcination temperature. As shown in Figure S11, the CdS@A-TaOx-700 possessed a much lower photocatalytic hydrogen production of 7.86 μmol·mg–1·h–1 than that of S-Ta2O5/CdS, because of the weak interface reaction between amorphous tantalum oxide (Figure S4) and CdS without sublimation (Figure S1), implying the S doping into Ta2O5 was important to thephotocatalytic hydrogen production. The CdS/CdO2@S-Ta2O5 (Figure S11) also possessed a slightly lower photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 48.33 μmol·mg–1·h–1 than that of S-Ta2O5/CdS, because of the increased content of CdO2 (Figure 1 e), implying the CdO2 was not the cause of high photocatalytic activity. As illustrated in Figure 4 d, the hydrogen production activity of the S-Ta2O5/CdS had no noticeable deactivation over 20 h, demonstrating its excellent photocatalytic stability. Meanwhile, the photocatalytic stability of pure CdS was worse, which was reduced about 41%, as shown in Figure S12. The negligible change of XRD pattern (Figure S13) and XPS result (Figure S14) also proved that the stability of S-Ta2O5/CdS was excellent. Therefore, the S-Ta2O5 nanoparticles on the surface of CdS nanospheres can dramatically improve the light corrosion resistance to enhance the photocatalytic stability of hydrogen production. As a result, the S-doped Ta2O5 was not prone to photo-corrosion and can effectively improve the photo-corrosion resistance of CdS. In order to discuss the reasons of enhanced photocatalytic activity of S-Ta2O5/CdS, the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was used to confirm the energy band matching of CdS, Ta2O5, and S-Ta2O5. In addition, the UPS spectra of secondary edge region and low energy onset region and the according band structure diagram for S-Ta2O5/CdS, as shown in Figure S15, the band-edge potential of the band structure for S-Ta2O5/CdS sample was obtained. From the Ecutoff (secondary electron cutoff) and EVBM (valence band maximum) of UPS recorded in Figure 4 e and 4f, the work function (ϕ) of the sample can be obtained by Ecutoff,49 which were 2.92, 4.12, and 3.82 for CdS, Ta2O5, and S-Ta2O5, respectively. The valence band maximum (VBM) energy levels was obtained by calculating from the UPS data defined by the following equation:33, 50 VBM = hν − (Ecutoff − EVBM) wherein EVBM was the onset relative to the Fermi level (EF) of the Si substrate and hν (21.22 eV) was the incident photon energy. So, the valence band energies (EVB) were determined to be 5.72, 7.62, and 7.72 eV, respectively. Furthermore, from the equation Eg=EVB−ECB, the band gap of CdS, Ta2O5, and S-Ta2O5 were thus determined by UV-Vis result to be 2.16, 3.6, and 3.5 eV, respectively. Figure 4 g showed the energy band structures of CdS, Ta2O5, and S-Ta2O5. The conduction band (CB) of CdS at −3.56 eV vs. Vacuum was higher than that (−4.02 eV vs. Vacuum) of Ta2O5 to confirm the band matching structure, which improved the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron hole pairs and according photogenerated electrons were transferred from CdS to Ta2O5. After S doping, both the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) of S-Ta2O5 shifted down, and the energy gap of 3.5 eV was obtained, which slightly affect visible light absorption. In addition, the conduction band (CB) of S-Ta2O5 at −4.42 eV vs. Vacuum was closer to Zero vs. RHE, implying the S-Ta2O5 was possible to be highly efficient co-catalyst. Usually, the highly active electrocatalysts acted as co-catalysts, such as Pt.51 TaS2 was also reported as efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).52 In order to confirm the speculation, the polarization curve of CdS, Ta2O5, and S-Ta2O5 were tested by electrochemical operation in the three electrodes system , and the onset potential is the applied potential with an apparent cathodic current density of 1 mA cm-2 from the polarization curves53. As shown in Figure 4 h, S-Ta2O5 possessed an onset potential of −173 mV vs. RHE to reach the 1 mA/cm2, which was much lower than those of CdS (> 500 mV) and Ta2O5 (–396 mV), confirming that the S-Ta2O5 was efficient electrocatalysts for HER, which was suitable to act as co-catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen production. The enhanced effect of S-Ta2O5 as co-catalysts was close to or even surpass that of 5 wt% Pt onto CdS nanospheres, the according photocatalytic H2 evolution rate was shown in Figure S16. In addition, the photocatalytic H2 activity of S-Ta2O5 and pure Ta2O5 under UV light irradiation (365 nm) was carried out as shown in Figure S17. Compared to the pure Ta2O5 (2.44 μmol·mg–1·h–1), the higher photocatalytic H2 evolution rate (3.21 μmol·mg–1·h–1) of S-Ta2O5 also confirmed the co-catalyst effect of S-Ta2O5. Therefore, the catalytic mechanism of S-Ta2O5/CdS was shown in Figure 4 i. Under the visible light irradiation, photo-induced electrons on the VB of CdS with appropriate band gap of 2.16 eV jumped to the CB. Due to band matching structure between CdS and S-Ta2O5, the photo-induced electrons transported from CB of CdS to CB (close to zero vs. RHE) of S-Ta2O5, which served as the active sites for reducing H+ into H2. In addition, the S doped Ta2O5 with a large band gap of 3.5 eV slightly affect visible light absorption of CdS photocatalysts, while it could effectively improve the corrosion resistance. Meanwhile, the photoproduction holes were also consumed by sacrificial agents to improve the efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production and the corrosion resistance of CdS. At last, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots (Figure S18a), the photoelectrochemical (PEC) photocurrent responses (Figure S18b), photoluminescence spectrum (PL) results (Figure S18c), fluorescence lifetime (Figure S18d) of CdS and S-Ta2O5/CdS were carried out to confirm the mechanism of efficient photoelectron hole separation efficiency54. As shown in Figure S18a, the S-Ta2O5/CdS had the smallest charge transfer resistance (Rct), which proved its better electron transport efficiency no matter in dark or under light. The larger change of current density from dark to light for S-Ta2O5/CdS compared with that of CdS indicated better photoelectric transmission efficiency (Figure S18b). For photoluminescence spectrum (PL) after loading of S-Ta2O5, the distinct emission peak at 650 nm of S-Ta2O5/CdS was weaken (Figure S18c), implying the reduced recombination rate of photogenerated electron hole pairs. The fluorescence lifetime of CdS and S-Ta2O5/CdS also proved the result, and the according average fluorescence lifetime were 0.002, 0.067 ns (Figure S18d)."
8,Conclusion,"The S-Ta2O5 nanoparticles decorated CdS nanospheres were synthesized via interfacial diffusionreaction between CdS and Ta2O5. In this system, CdS acted as a visible light photocatalyst, and S-Ta2O5 could not only formed heterojunction band matching with CdS, but also serve as co-catalyst to provide the hydrogen production active sites, which significantly improved the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. The obtained S-Ta2O5/CdS possessed the high photocatalytic hydrogen production activity with a H2 evolution rate of 54.51 μmol·mg–1·h–1, much larger than that of CdS (1.51 μmol·mg–1·h–1). More importantly, the formed strong interface structure between CdS and S-Ta2O5 could effectively improve the photo-corrosion resistance of CdS, which exhibited an improved photocatalytic stability of noticeable deactivation over 20 h."
