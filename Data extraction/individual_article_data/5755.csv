0,Introduction,"At present, most countries depend on fossil fuels to sustain their rising energy demands. However, fossil fuels have limited reserves and will be exhausted much faster than new reserves can be created, at the current rate of consumption. Hence researchers concerned to procure bioenergy derived from biomass that can be continuously replenished. Biomass is a rousing, promising energy source that has stored sunlight in different forms such as plants, agricultural crops, fodders, bagasse and municipal wastes. In the past three decades, biomaterials attracted as favourable renewable energy sources, due to the health and environmental benefits by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and provide a constant supply of energy including stabilizing energy prices. Renewable woody biomass is an abundant reserve that can be converted to useful chemicals, materials and fuels, proving cleaner, renewable alternatives to many existing power facilities that currently use fossil fuels. Levulinic acid (LA), one of the substantial platform chemicals, derived from renewable sources such as carbohydrates and also from agricultural wastes. [1,2]. The researchers prompted production of biofuels or chemical intermediates from renewable platform chemicals as the fuel additives as the oil prices are change continuously. Levulinic acid contain a ketone and an acidic carboxyl groups impart a significant array of reactivity that lead to form numerous derivatives having major applications in different fields, consequently making it a resourceful green platform chemical [3,4]. Esterification of LA has been described at different conditions using several homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts to attain preferred selectivity with rise in reaction rates and appreciable yields. The most prevalent methods for the esterification of LA use homogeneous mineral acid catalysts due to their high catalytic activity. The commonly used mineral acid catalysts, such as H3PO4, H2SO4, HCl and HNO3 are preferred due to low cost, easy accessibility and their efficacy in relation to high LA yields. Even though the esterification of LA in the presence of homogeneous catalysts are effective, they show notable drawbacks, such as the deterioration of equipment, additional work up for neutralization of acids, the difficulty in acid recovery for reuse and pollution of sewage [5–8]. These shortcomings can be avoided by changing homogeneous acid catalysts with heterogeneous solid ones. Therefore, the expansion of environmental friendly heterogeneous catalysts for esterification of levulinic acid is desirable. There are numerous reports for the esterification of levulinic acid with alcohols using heterogeneous catalysts with moderate to excellent yields. For instance, solid carbon-based heterogeneous catalysts have been developedin which good to excellent yield of ethyl levulinate was attained [9–11]. Several types of heterogeneous acid catalysts have been used to obtain ethyl levulinate by esterification with ethanol such as ZrO2/TiO2 nanocomposites [12],Solid acid Amberlyst [13],Silicotungstic-Acid [14],nanoporous silica gels [15], clinoptilolite loaded with either SnO2 ,orsulphated SnO2 [16],sulphobenzylated nanoporous Al-SBA-15 [17],ZSM-12 nanolayers zeolite [18]. Meanwhile, modified heterogeneous hydrated and dehydrated UiO66 metal organic framework was fabricated and found active in the conversion of LA into EL with considerable recyclability [19]. Subsequently, an attractive biomass conversion protocol using metal organic framework (MOF)-supported polyoxometalates was studied. The synthesized catalyst showed admirable activity with 100% EL yield at 120 °C for 6 h due to the uniform dispersion of acidic sites in framework [20]. Maggi et al.investigated silica-supported sulfonic acids for esterification of levulinic acid with stoichiometric amounts of alcohols [21]. This methodology demonstrated very active heterogeneous catalysts tolerating primary and secondary alcohols, under mild conditions (75 °C, 2 h). The selectivity towards desired products remained complete in all cases and the bye-product of the reaction, water, did not alter the effectiveness of this solvent-free process. Recently, Zhou and co-workers synthesized titanate nanotubes-bonded organosulfonic acid as solid acid catalyst for the synthesis of butyl levulinate [22]. The heterogeneous catalyst exhibited strong acidic sites with high stability, recyclability proved to be a prospective candidate for butyl levulinate production. Very recently, Chermahini and Assar designed and invented propyl sulfonic acid-functionalized mesoporous silica for the synthesis of butyl levulinate at 90 °C temperature, alcohol-to-LA molar ratio 1:4, using 50 mg loading in 8 h [23]. The interest in EL as a growing ecological and renewable bio-energy source is still unusual, as indicated by numerous publications in scientific journals that focus on esterification of LA and ethanol by sulphonic acid functionalized heterogeneous catalysts [24–29]. Su et al. successfully fabricated kegging type heteropoly acid and ZrO2 functionalized ethane-bridged organosilica hollow nanosphere hybrid materials and evaluated performance for synthesis of methyl levulinate [30]. Successively, ruthenium nanoparticles supported over mesoporous TiO2 as an efficient bifunctional nano catalyst for esterification of LA and methanol at 65 °C in 8 h employed [31].Due to wide array of potential application of various esters of LA, several research groups are engaged with synthesis of different alkyl levulinates using versatile heterogeneous catalyst varying short chain alcohol to long chain including branched alcohols [32–37]. Saravanamurugan and research groupintroduced sulphonic acid functionalized ionic liquids (ILs) for facile conversion of mono and disaccharides to EL [38]. The protocol affords easy phase separation and recovery of the product after the reaction, thermal stability and scale up synthesis, makes the process industrially viable. The influence of IL in the catalyst was further supported by using heterogeneousHPAs and POM-based ILsin the effective conversion of furfuryl alcohol to alkyl levulinates with thehighest butyl levulinate yield of 94% [39]. Recently, Sun et al. demonstrated effective and recoverable Brønsted acidic IL-based hybrid catalysts with high catalytic activity towards synthesis of EL via ethanolysis of furfuryl alcohol [40]. Notably, the deactivation and acid site leaching of catalyst were inhibited efficiently with excellent reusability without loss of activity. G. Corro et al. described biodiesel production from Jatropha curcas crude oil under UV irradiation using ZnO/SiO2 photocatalyst for free fatty acids esterification. The same group has design and fabricated Cr/SiO2 composites for effective photocatalytic esterification of FFAs with methanol [41,42].Manique and his research group displayed application of hydrothermally produced TiO2 nanotubes in photocatalytic esterification of oleic acid [43], with 15% catalyst and a 3:1 M ratio of methanol to oleic acid. It was found that numerous approaches have been established to achieve esterification of LA with alcohols.Yet,there is no preceding report dealing with the production of OL by photocatalytic esterification using BAFPcPDIL catalyst. Bioinspired Porphyrin received attracted wide-ranging attention as a heterogeneous photocatalyst for the degradation of azo dye pollutants in water and air under visible radiation [44]. Besides, phthalocyanine based framework has also been used as photocatalyst for degradation of cationic and anionic dye [45]. However, the literature survey indicated that esterification of LA has not been accomplished by a heterogeneous photocatalytic process. In this study, we have fabricated a BAFPcPDIL, exhibiting strong absorption band in between 557 nm signifying its application for photocatalytic esterification of LA with various alcohols under visible light irradiation at ambient conditions. Thus, BAFPcPDIL photocatalyst incorporated with ionic liquids play the dual role to enhance hydrophilicity and non-covalent interactions, to control over the performance of active species by agitating the energies of the transition states during photocatalysis. These abiological catalytic systems are active and selective toward organic transformations with readily separable products[46,47]. Beside catalyst selection for the esterification reaction, the examination of process variables are too essential to identify environmental benign photocatalyst. (RSM) is widely used as an optimization software for several biomass conversion reactions such as etherification, ethanolysis, transesterification and esterification reactions [48–54]. Literature study indicated that RSM has not been described for esterification of LA with OA reaction using BAFPcPDIL photocatalyst. The present protocol involves effect of process variables for formation of OL using RSM design expert software with BBD over BAFPcPDIL photocatalyst. The design expert software tool is used to attain the best process parameters for esterification reaction with intention to enhance OL yield. The effect of four critical process variables such ascatalyst loading(A),OA to LA molar ratio(B)and power of visible light(C),duration (D)on OL yield was explored by BBD of RSM. Also, this protocol of photocatalytic esterification successfully delivered excellent OL yield with 1:1 M ratio of OA : LA with loading of 10 mg photocatalyst, compare to other reported methodologies. The relationship between the process parameters is attributed using experimental and mathematical equations. The best reaction parameters recommended by RSM were confirmed by experimentations. The optimized reaction variables were used to assess the recyclability of prospective photocatalyst."

5,Strategy ofinvestigation andoptimizationby ResponseSurfacemethodology - (RSM),"2.4 Strategy ofinvestigation andoptimizationby ResponseSurfacemethodology - (RSM) The parameters planned in this protocol are catalyst loading in mg (A), mole ratio (OA:LA) in mmol (B), power of visible light in Watt (C) and duration in hour (D) to capitalize on the conversion of OL. The array of these parameters was selected based on the literature reports of esterification of LA and different alcohols [49,54]. Choice of these disclosures is based on the following justifications: 1. The quantity ofOA increases, equilibrium shifts towards the forward direction and yield of the product increased hence the study of OA: LA mole ratio is significant. 2. Catalyst provides surface to form an active intermediate with the reactants that enhance the rate of the reaction. Consequently, more surface area will be provided by more catalyst loading to increase the rate of reaction. 3. Photocatalytic reactions depend on light intensity. When the light intensity is high, the reaction rate found to be proportional to the square root of light intensity.Conversely, at the low-intensity level, the rate of photocatalysis is directly proportional to the light intensity [41,42]. To initiate photoreaction absorption of photon and formation of electron hole pair is needed which is a strong function of light intensity. 4. Hence to design and fabricate the reactor, catalyst loading in mg, alcohol to LA molar ratio in mmol, power of visible light in watt and duration in hours becomes essential to study. So, in this research quadratic effect of these parameters is studied to optimize the parameters. An experimental pattern for the reaction variables used in the esterification of LA with OA overBAFPcPDIL,photocatalyst to synthesize OL was performed by RSM withDesign-Expert Version 12(Stat-Ease, Inc., Minneapolis, USA). A BBD experimental design was employed in this trial needs 29 experimental runs including five experiments at central point’s [53–54]. The set of experiments as designed by BBD, along with the response has been shown in(Table 3). Each factor in the experimentation was recognized and coded at the three levels by related minus signs (−1) for low levels, zero (0) demonstrating centre value and plus signs (+1) for high levels as shown in the BBD matrix of the four variables in coded units, actual units and corresponding response values are given in (Table 1 ). To know the performance of different process parameters and to ascertain their values which lead to optimum conversion, (3D–graph) response diagrams were generated and the graph plotted between two parameters, keeping the other two parameters constant, is depicted in (Fig. 8). It is apparent that when the condition is constant, a decrease in mole ratio and an increase in the catalyst loading increases the conversion. At a fixed catalyst loading, conversion is a strong function of radiation as compared to the mole ratio. Both catalyst loading and visible light irradiation have a progressive effect on conversion at a constant mole ratio. The optimized process variables predicted by RSM are 10 mg catalyst loading, 1:1 mol ratio (OA: LA) and power of visible light 12 W, time 12 h condition, giving an absolute conversion of 95.58%. The values coded for these factors were calculated by the following equation: (1) (1) X i = x 0 - x i Δ x where xi coded value of ith variable, Xi un-coded value of the ith test variable, Δx difference between the proceeding values and x0 un-coded value of the ith test variable at the center point. The factor levels with the corresponding real values and the design matrix are shown in Table 1. The matrix for the four variables was varied at five levels (–1, 0 and + 1). As usual, random experiments were performed to eliminate the system errors."

7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The FT-IR bands at 3219 and 970 cm−1 of BAFPcPDIL photocatalyst are assigned to –NH stretching and bending vibrations of the phthalocyanine core, respectively.Moreover, -N–H stretching vibrations of the amide group on the side chains could not be notable, due to overlapping of –NH stretching vibration of phthalocyanine core.In addition, a band corresponding to –CN 2241 cm−1, was absent in core which confirm the involvement of this group in the formation of phthalocyanine, lead to excellent agreement with reported IR spectra in the literature [63]. It is also reported that asymmetric and symmetric vibrations of –NO2 in core appear at 1514 and 1357 cm−1, which were inherited from precursors 1D and 2C. The bands in the range of 1695–1697 cm−1 are attributed to-C = O stretching vibration (amide I). The band at about 1591 cm –1 isassigned to -C–N stretching (imide II) and also exits in 2C. The bands at 717–597 cm are designated to the methylene in-plane rocking vibration of a straight alkyl chain comprisingfour carbon atoms (Fig. 3A). The FTIR spectrum of precursor of phthalocyanine 1D is shown in (Fig. 3A).The spectrum shows a broad band in the region 3414 cm−1,which is attributed to –OH groups of –SO3H/SO4H. It is appropriate to rebounds a band in the region 2241 cm−1 and 1514 and 1357 cm−1 corresponding to –CN and –NO2 respectively for asymmetric and symmetric vibrations (Fig. 3A). Similarly, FT-IR spectrum of 2C reflected with sharp bands corresponding to –CN and–NO2. Moreover,the FT-IR bands at 3327 and 970 cm−1 assigned to –NH stretching and bending vibrations of the phthalocyanine core, respectively (Fig. 3). UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were acquired with a UV–Vis-NIR Spectrophotometer (Jasco ISN-723, Sr. no. B 072061154, Made in Japan) was used to evaluate DRS-Spectra of solid sample ofBAFPcPDIL. Wavelength of light displayed 557 nm, representing absorption with respect to the corresponding band gap energy (E) was calculated 2.22 eV (Fig. 3B). based on tauc plot as well as the following equation no. (2) (2) E = h ν = h C λ = 1240 λ where, E = energy, h = Planck's constant, ν = frequency of light, c = speed of light, and λ = wavelengthof light Consequently, the potential reactivity of BAFPcPDIL photo-catalyst might be projected, ascribed to its prominent optical property in the visible light region. [64]. The admirable photocatalytic absorption at 557 nm in visible light irradiation under optimized conditions generated by RSM, is reliable with the DRS results. The Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images of BAFPcPDIL were recorded and the morphologies are shown in Fig. 3C. It is found that uniform agglomeration of photocatalyst was observed and morphologies of all the particles were nearly alike. Fig. 3D also depicted the EDAX spectra of BAFPcPDIL indicating, solid peaks of C, N, O, and S, Cl were present, confirming the existence of sulphonic acid and sulphate ions from sulphuric acid which subsist on BAFPcPDIL surface. Hammett value (H0) of the synthesized BAFPcPDIL has been determined using UV–vis spectroscopy which was interrelated with their catalytic activity shown in (Fig. 4). The acidity of BAFPcPDIL was assessed using 4-nitroaniline as an indicator to recognize the Hammett acidity (H0). The H0 function has been widely used as an extent of surface proton levels that affect acid–base catalyzed reactions. Hammett and Deyrup have established Hammett acidity function for defining the acid strength of solid catalysts. Accordingly, the ratio [I]/[IH] (I represents indicator) was measured from the differences of absorbance before and after the charging of BAFPcPDIL and the proportional acidity was calculated by using Eq. (3) as a Hammett function H0 = 0.78 at 380 nm [39]. (3) H 0 = p K a + log I I H + where, the pKa value of the indicator prepared to an aqueous solution, and [I] and [IH+] are the molar concentrations of the unprotonated and protonated forms of the indicator in the solvent, respectively [65]."
8,Photocatalytic assessment and analysis of product,"3.2 Photocatalytic assessment and analysis of product The photocatalytic esterification experiments were performed in a home-made photo reactor using parameters obtained from RSM using BBD. The experimental set-up is shown in(Fig. 1 ) LED lamps were used as a power of visible light (6 W, 9 W, 12 W), the distance between the reactor and the light was 10 cm, to know light intensity of photo reactor in different power of visible light was(0.0047 W/cm2, 0.0071 W/cm2 and 0.095 W/cm2 respectively), and the reactor was fixed with an exhaust fan to ensure circulation of air to maintain ambient condition. The mixture ofLA with alcoholwas placedin a 100 mL conical flask (Glassco)and then the appropriate amount of BAFPcPDIL was charged. The experiments on photoreactor were performed using following identical process parameters: photo-catalyst (5–10 mg), molar ratio of OA to LA (0.8–1.2 mmol) for different source of light (6–12 W), reaction time (9–15 h), speed of agitation of 350 rpm. After completion of reaction, the mixture ethyl acetate brine solution was added to extract the product in organic layer. The organic extract was dried using sodium sulphate and the required product was obtained by evaporation of solvent under vacuum. The desired product was confirmed by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra, recorded on a Bruker spectrometer operating at 400 MHz at ambient condition using CDCl3 and DMSO‑d 6 as solvent and TMS (δ = 0.00) for 1H and 13C calibration. FT-IR spectrophotometer using KBr pellet method andGas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GC–MS)by Perkin Elmer Clarus 600C mass spectrometer to confirm the formation of product.The experimental yield and predicted yield of OL were 95.58% and 87.58% respectively in all the studied experiments. (Table 3, Run no. 6). In this study, BAFPcPDIL was found to be potential catalyst for synthesis of octyl levulinate bio fuel. Hence, RSM design with BBD is used to investigate influence of various reaction parameters and optimize the yield of bio fuel and other alkyl ester by using optimum conditions. With the optimized conditions in hand, esterification reaction of LA with different alcohols methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, iso-propanol. n-butanol, tert-butanol, n-pentanol, n-hexanol and n-octanol were achieved in the presence ofBAFPcPDIL photocatalyst, (Table 2 ).Fig. 2."
9,Statistical analysis of model,"3.3 Statistical analysis of model For the evaluation of responses, the quadratic model wasgeneratedbyRSMdesign. The percentage yield of OL obtained from LA and OA overBAFPcPDIL, are indicated separately as experimentalandpredicted valuesin(Table 3 ).In all the experiments, the 100% selectivity was found towards OL. As indicated in thetable,theyieldofOL increased from 25.5% to 95.58%, depending on the reaction conditions.From the RSM analysis, the second order quadratic model of coded units for the yield of octyl levulinate (Y) is presented as the following equation:(4 and 5). 3.3.1 Final equation in terms of coded factors (4) Yield Y = + 58.51 + 16.78 A + 4.08 B + 12.20 C + 10.27 D + 2.79 AB - 6.85 AC + 3.34 AD + 0.5200 BC + 3.80 BD + 1.24 CD + 10.58 A 2 - 8.81 B 2 - 3.64 C 2 - 11.44 D 2 The equation in terms of coded factors was used to make predictions about the response for given levels of each factor. By default, the high levels of the factors were coded as + 1 and the low levels were coded as −1 (Table 1). The coded equation was useful for identifying the relative impact of the factors by comparing the factor coefficients. 3.3.2 Final equation in terms of actual factors (5) Yield Y = - 311.72833 - - 21.36900 Cat . + 335.15417 Ratio + 15.66583 Power + 23.01611 Time + 5.57000 Cat . ∗ Ratio - 0.912667 Cat . ∗ Power + 0.445333 Cat . ∗ Time + 0.866667 Ratio ∗ Power + 6.32917 Ratio ∗ Time + 0.137778 Power ∗ Time + 1.69207 Cat . 2 - - 220.14583 Rati o 2 - 0.404120 Powe r 2 - 1.27093 Tim e 2 The equation in terms of actual factors was used to make predictions about the response for given levels of each factor. Here, the levels were specified in the original units for each factor (Table 1). Positive sign in front of linear term reveals that, with an increasing the variable, the response (Y, yield of OL) intensifies linearly (synergistic influence), on other hand negative sign specifies incompatible influence. From the equation, the yield of OL has linear and quadratic effects by the four process variables. From Eq. (4 and 5) and the coefficients values for each effect, can be perceived that the highest influence on the yield of OL by esterification process, for the examined range of values, ascribed to the catalyst present in the system (code A). Then most imperative effects on the response are power of visible light and reaction time (codes C and D), which have nearly equal influence, followed by slightly weaker quadratic effect (code A2). Correlation value (R2) of Eqs. (4) & (5) was 0.9552, concludes that 95.52% of the total variation in the results was recognized to the independent variables studied. R2-adjusted, R2-predicted and adequate precision values were 0.9103, 0.7426 and 16.2578, respectively. The R 2-predicted is in suitably matching with R 2-adjusted and both are larger than 0.6. The adequate precision value > 4 obtained in this case suggests a sufficient signal ratio and reveals that Eq. (5) can be applied for piloting of the design space. The line of perfect fit with points analogous to zero error between the predicted values and actual values was presented in Fig. 5 . It specifies that the model demonstrate a reasonably good account of the investigational data on the OL yield. It could be apparent from the graph that all the points are very adjacent to the line of perfect fit. Therefore, there is suitable correlation between the projected values and the experimental values of the independent variable which further clarified the appropriateness of the model. It has been proved from the Table 4 ANOVA the “Lack of Fit F-value” of 91.16 suggests the Lack of Fit is significant with the error 0.03%. Non-significant lack of fit is respected for the model to fit. Non-significant lack of fit is respected for the model to fit [72]. The perturbation plot in Fig. 6 (i) shows a steep slope for duration (D) compared with photocatalyst loading (A) and molar ratio of LA: OA (B). Therefore, the response is sensitive to these factors and the highest influence arises with the duration followed by photocatalyst loading and molar ratio. Fig. 6 (ii) shows the Box–Cox plot which delivers instruction for choosing the correct power law transformation. Usually, most of the parameter’s assessment might appear to be significant outside the region of the optimum, but near it only a few will be highly significant. Our study model revealed that the minimum confidence interval value is −0.22 and the maximum value is 1.92. The present point of confidence interval (k = 1) matches to model design value (best = 0.87); hence, no transformation of the model was necessary as suggested by the Box–Cox analysis [70,71]. The normalized plot of residuals for the esterification was designed in Fig. 7 . The data follows the straight line, meticulously. This shows that the response transformation affords a better analysis, and the model proposed for the production of OL is acceptable. The statistical treatment of the data was made in three phases. The first phase includes the use of ANOVA, with the aim of studying the effect of factors and their interactions. The second phase consists of the choice of the best model transforms law to obtain the highest correlation between the parameters using Box-Cox Plot for Power Transform. Afterwards, in the final phase, the results have to be optimized [70,71]. A statistical model fit summary comprising inadequacy of fit tests and a sequential model sum of squares supported a quadratic model as the ultimate fitting model.Statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the main effects and the interfaces for the selected response, along with the test of statistical importance for the response surface quadratic model arepresented in(Table 4).The sum of squares is employed for calculation of the F-values (F), which are the ratio of the effect of relevant mean square and the mean square error [49]. Fisher F-test has offered commanding effect (low probability value, P-value < 0.05), therefore it revealed that following effects are statistically important for the response (Y):linear effects of catalyst, molar ratio of OA to LA, power of visible light, reaction time, quadratic effects of molar ratio OA to LA ratio, and reaction time, andinteraction effects of catalyst with reaction time and reaction power, molar ratio with reaction time.Moreover, the value of p < 0.0001 specifies that there is only a 0.01% chance that a large ‘model F-value’ could arise due to noise in the experimentations.From Table 4 ANOVA the consequence and competence of the conventional model was also explained by high value of coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.9552 and adj. value R2 of 0.9103 for the established correlation. It implies that the model explains95.52%of the total variation in the yield of OL which was endorsed to the experimental parameters [72]."
10,Effect of process variables on the yield of octyl levulinate,"3.4 Effect of process variables on the yield of octyl levulinate The results in Table 3 clarify that interactions between variables have extensive influence on the yield of OL. As identified before, model Eq. (4) & (5) can be presented in the form of three dimensional (3D-graph) response surface plots to afford good yield of OL for various values of catalyst quantity ofratio OA to LA (Fig. 8 A), catalyst quantity to power of visible light (Fig. 8B), catalyst quantity to reaction time (Fig. 8C),molar ratio reactants to power of visible light (Fig. 8D), molar ratio of reactants and reaction time (Fig. 8E) and reaction time and power of visible light (Fig. 8F). In all of these cases other two variables were remained unchanged in the production of OL. The consequence of interaction between catalyst quantity and ratio of OA to LA at constant reaction time (12 h) and power of visible light (12 W) is indicated in(Fig. 8A). The yield ofOL was greater than 53.09%when the catalyst quantity and molar ratio of reactants were 10 mg and 1:1 respectively. The yield of the OL was greatly affected with catalyst loading from 5 mg to 10 mg (Table 3, Run No. 6, 7). However, yield of the product was drastically decreased to 47.71% and 60.23% at 7.5 mg (Table 3, Run No. 4 and 8), with molar ratio of reactants 0.8 : 1 and 1.2 : 1 This is concluded that desired molar ratio of OA to LA is 1:1 lead to the highest yield. 95.58%. The influence of catalyst quantity and power of visible light on yield ofOL at a constant molar ratio (1:1) and reaction time (12 h) is shown in (Fig. 8B). The yield ofOL was moved up considerablyby the catalyst quantity and power of visible light from 6 W to 12 W. At low catalyst quantity 5 mg, the yield ofOL enhanced from 25.78% to 70.84% with increasing power of visible light 6 W to 12 W (Table 3, Run No. 7, 12, 14, 20 and 22, 24). The yield ofproduct was modest 57.25% to 59.64% by increasing quantity of catalyst 7.5 mg and changing power of visible light (9 W) (Table 3, Run No. 2, 5, 13, 18, 28). Conversely, it has been found that using 10 mg of catalyst the yield of OL was greatly influenced from 6 W to 12 W with 81.15% to 95.58% respectively (Table 3, Run No. 6, 21). It validates that 10 mg catalyst has positive impact onOL yield in presence of 12 W source of light. The effect of interaction between catalyst quantity and reaction time onesterification of LA at constant molar ratio (1:1) and power of visible light (12 W) is shown in(Fig. 8C). The yield ofOL 46.21% and 62.53% (Table 3, Run No. 17 and 26) and 25.5% to 62.53% was not inclined by using 7.5 mg catalyst (Table 3, Run No. 1, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 23, 25, 29). On the contrary, the yield of OL was significantly influenced by increasing catalyst loading from 5 mg to 10 mg with 70.84% to 95.58% respectively (Table 3, Run No. 6 and 7). It reconfirms that 10 mg catalyst has positive effect onOL yield in duration 12 h. The impact of molar ratio of OA to LAand power of visible light on yield ofOL at a constant catalyst quantity (10 mg) and duration (12 h) is depicted in(Fig. 8D). The yield ofOL was affected 67.18% to 81.68% with increased in molar ratio of OA to LA from 0.8 to 1.2 at 9 W(Table 3, Run No. 3 and 27). The positive effect was observed by changing power of visible light from 6 W to 12 W with drastic change in yield from 81.15% to 95.58%reflecting optimum reaction condition derived from RSM (Table 3, Run No. 6 and 21). However, increasing the duration from 9 h to 15 h using 9 W light lead to increase in the OL yield from 53.09 to 88.75, indicating influence of duration in presence of photocatalyst. (Table 3, Run No. 16 and 19) Similarly, the consequence of molar ratio of OA to LA and duration on yield ofOL at a constant catalyst quantity (10 mg) and power of visible light (12 W) is indicated in(Fig. 8E). and (Table 3, Run No. 6). Finally, the influence of reaction time and power of visible light on yield of product at constant molar ratio of OA to LA (1:1) and catalyst quantity (10 mg) is illustrated in(Fig. 8F). The progressive effect was witnessed by changing power of visible light from 6 W to 12 W with drastic change in yield from 81.15% to 95.58% using 10 mg catalyst and 1:1 ratio of the reactants (Table 3, Run No. 6 and 21)."
11,Optimization by response surface methodology,"3.5 Optimization by response surface methodology The best possible process variables for esterification of LA withOA were acquired by using numerical technique (numerical algorithm) built in the software (Design-Expert Version 12 (Stat-Ease, Inc., Minneapolis, USA) based on the predicted model and the factors in their acute range as the controls [49,59]. The numerical optimization examines the design space using the advanced model in the analysis to identify factor settings that meet the objective of increasing the percent yield ofOL. The independent factors used in numerical optimization include catalyst loading, molar ratio ofOA to LA, duration and power of visible light were set within the range between low (−1) and high (+1) while the yield ofOL 95.58% was set to maximum value. Box-Behnken design was effectively implemented and the experimentations were considered picking the input variables for the level selected. With minimum number of trials information was composed and the models were established. RSM evolved for responses show the influence of each input parameter and its interaction with other factors, representing the trends of response. A quadratic model was projected to designate the relationship between the photo-catalyst loading and two input variables. Analysis of variance specified that the suggested quadratic model was positively interpreted the trial data with coefficient of determination of R2 = 0.9552and adjusted R2 = 0.9103. With condensed number of experimental runs properly considerable, consistent and satisfactory result have been achieved which can be followed for acquiring the most favourable conditions for photo-catalytic esterification of LA. The aim of this study was to nurture the best photocatalytic reaction conditions for esterification of LA with OA using RSM. A three-level factor BBD was applied for studying the interfaces between the critical variables including catalyst loading, power of light and duration of reaction. Thus, an attempt was made to compare the role of photocatalyst loading on production of OL. We have segregated all the runs that involved 5, 7.5 and 10 mg catalyst. It was found a mere 29.03% yield of OL with 5 mg in 12 h under irradiation of 6 W light. (Run 22). The influence of duration was further confirmed when esterification of LA carried out for 15 h under irradiation of 9 W light. (Run 14 and 24). The yield of OL was promoted with molar ratio of OA : LA, afforded 47.85% in the same duration under 9w light. (Run 12 and 20). On the other hand, significant improvement of the yield was noted when the 12 h duration and 12 W power of light was adopted. (Run no. 7). The effects of photocatalyst dosage using 7.5 mg under 6 W light with different duration are shown in runs 1, 9, 23 and 25 of Table 3. The results indicated that increasing the photocatalytic loading caused an increase in OL yield compare to 5 mg catalyst. The interactive effects of the OA : LA mole ratio and differentduration using 7.5 mg photocatalyst under irradiation of 9 W, on the production of OL shows progressive influence on the yield with increase in duration. (Table 3. Run Nos. 29, 2, 5, 13, 18, 28) When it comes to minimum molar ratio of the substrates the yield was slightly enhanced (Run Nos. 11, 15) and accelerated further with higher duration and molar ratio (Run No 10) Moreover, increasing the power of light to 12 W with variation of duration resulted in moderate increase in the OL yield, indicating little influence of 7.5 mg of photocatalyst. (Run Nos. 4, 8, 17, 26) The cumulative effect of the other dependent variables using 10 mg photocatalyst, were illustrated in Table 3. These outcomes can be revealed by the excellent yield of ester, which showed the comparative effects of dependent variables, duration and power of light. The increase in OL yield can be rationalized with catalyst loading due to the formation of photoexcited electrons which increases the photocatalytic esterification. (Run No. 21) A progressive increase in formation of OL is observed as a function of power of light and duration revealing that the requirement of both photocatalyst and light for the highest product yield. (Run Nos. 3, 6, 16, 19 ,27) Thus, as the experimental error is less than ± 10%, it can be resolved that the proposed statistical model was acceptable for predicting the yield of OL by esterification reaction [50,51]. The main objective of a photocatalyst is to absorb radiations to produce electrons and to assist reactions between the excited electrons with reactants to afford reduced products, and/or reactions between the produced holes with reductants to yield oxidized products. However, the number of photoelectrons released per unit area per unit time is directly related to the intensity of light radiations which influence the generation of number photoelectrons. The BAFPcPDIL photocatalyst has an excellent absorption capacity to absorb radiations in the visible region at 557 nm with 2.2 eV band gap. This makes BAFPcPDIL photocatalyst to absorb light in the visible region and generate photoelectrons and holes to promote photocatalytic esterification. The results demonstrated an excellent photocatalytic esterification of LA with 10 mg photocatalyst with irradiation of 12 W light, verified that these conditions are favoured for this reaction at ambient conditions. As the experimental conditions have a substantial impact on catalytic performance. The catalytic performance ofBAFPcPDIL photocatalyst wasevaluated at optimized process parameters for the esterification reaction of LA with different alcohols (Table No. 2).At this specific reaction conditions, the selected catalyst BAFPcPDIL performed best for all the esterification reactions. Hence, the reusability of potential BAFPcPDIL catalyst was tested for synthesis of OL bio-fuel at optimized process parameters obtained by RSM design (Table No. 3). The photo-catalyst BAFPcPDIL was washed with ethanol and acetone, dried for the subsequent recycling run thereby yielding 95.58% to 90.28% after fourthrun. (Fig. 9 A). The reaction rate declined in the fourth run may be ascribed to the overall loss of the photo-catalyst while handling it from the filter to the reaction flask. This verifies BAFPcPDIL catalyst is highly active and reusable. The stability of catalyst was confirmed from the FT-IR spectrum recorded for the fresh and photo-catalyst recovered after fourth run (Fig. 9B). This verifies BAFPcPDIL catalyst is highly active and reusable. The present study for synthesis of OL bio-fuel over BAFPcPDIL catalyst uses green chemistry principles with potential benefits in terms of minimum catalyst loading (10 mg) under visible light irradiations at ambient conditions. The protocol displays good atom economy (1:1 mol ratio of LA: OA) with an excellent yield of 95.58%. Furthermore, cross-contamination of product could be avoided due to single step work-up to separate product after the reaction by extraction with ethyl acetate and reusability of the same solvent for next separation, promotes E-factor i.e. economic efficiency of the protocol. The ironic aspect of this photocatalytic method is that, after the reaction, the photocatalyst could be separated easily by simple filtration and reuse for the next reaction."
12,Esterification mechanism of photocatalysis,"As can be seen in DRS spectrum (Fig. 3B), for photo-catalyst, covers an extensive range of wavelength 557 nm to intensify the electron-hole pair generation and to decrease the electron-hole pair recombination rates as described below. Based on the proposed mechanism in the literature [41]. The photocatalytic esterification proceeds by Langmuir-Hinshelwood reaction pathways: (i) Transfer of alcohol (ROH) and LA (R-COOH) to the surface of photo-catalyst during vigorous stirring of the reactor. (ii) Adsorption of OA and LA on the photocatalyst surface, mainly at perylene which may act electron acceptor as Lewis acid sites [42]. (iii) Generation of photo-induced electrons e − and holes h + due to absorption of photon by photo-catalyst (iv) The photo-generated holes (h + ) react with ROH adsorbed over the catalyst surface, producing hydrogen ions (H + ) and RO· radicals [41–42]. (v) At the same time, RCOOH· radicals are formed by reacting photogenerated electrons (e − ) with LA accumulated over the catalyst surface. (vi) Later, the generated active species H+, R-O·, and R-COOH· react to form desired product through intermediates (alkyl-ester and water), as indicated in the plausible reaction in (Figs. 10 and 11 ). (vii) Finally, the dynamic stirring conditions in the reactor transfer the products from the interface region to the liquid phase."
13,Physical test of fuel,"4.1 Physical test of fuel To know the potential application of OL as fuel additives we have blended diesel samples with 10, 20 and 25, 30%, OL with the diesel sample and matched the properties with the real diesel sample. Of these, cetane number, calorific values (MJ/Kg), density and kinematic viscosity @ 40 °C of the blended samples were found to be analogous with those of the real diesel sample, The flash point and fire point of the blended samples were found to be better with respect to the real sample (Table 5 ). Moreover, emission characteristics in terms of NOx, CO, CO2, HC and O2, Opacity of the blended samples have shown improvement in exhaust gases with reference to diesel sample (Table 6 ). Hawera kinematic viscosity @ 40 has increased proportionality with more percentage of biofuel blending. Consequently, the effect of blending of biodiesel-diesel fuel blending on emission of exhaust gases was also studied. This trial was applied on a diesel engine at 75% engine load and compare with real diesel sample under similar conditions and the results are shown in (Table 6). Exhaust gas emissions were observed using AVL Digas 444 N Gas Analyzer to obtain CO, HC, CO2, O2, opacity and NOx. The purpose of emission characteristics is to study influence of blending biodiesel-diesel fuel on exhaust gas emissions during the combustion process. The blending of 25% in biodiesel-diesel resulted in the reduction of CO, HC, CO2, O2 at 75% load at a different rotation from 1500 to 5500 rpm. Additionally, opacity has shown reduced to appreciable level while NOx level has also been decreased from 1158 to 1128 (Table 6. and Fig. 12) Biodiesel fuel has attracted as one of the best alternative source of renewable energy due to some peculiar characteristics like less polluting than petroleum diesel, absence of sulphur, good miscibility with energy sources and oil, adaptable with existing diesel engines and fuel pumps and lubricating property which support to enhance lifetime of the engine. Conversely, related to diesel fuel the use of B25 biodiesel has some drawbacks, namely its high viscosity and slightly low energy content. The high viscosity acquires poor vaporization, higher size of droplet and contracted injection spray angle. The fuel density is also a crucial factor, which influences directly on fuel injection systems and subsequently on the engine output power due to the different injected fuel masses [74]. Another significant fuel property of biodiesel that contribute a major role in the combustion and performance of diesel engine is cetane number (CN). The CN is a grade allotted to a fuel to rate the excellence of its burning. The higher the CN, the better the burning quality of fuel in the combustion chamber of engine vehicle. Thus, biodiesel B25 has higher cetane number, fire point and flash point than diesel sample. Moreover, B25 has lower pour point than mineral diesel. It is one of the major fuel characteristics that restricts the blending of biodiesel, mainly in cold weathers. [73,75] Table 6. Diesel-powered heavy-duty [78] biodiesel has an abundant prospective to decline environmental pollution as an alternate fuel for diesel engines. The most important environmental problem occurs due to emission of unburnt particulate, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide by transportation. Engine tests have been performed using biodiesel (B25) and compare with real diesel sample. The results found admirable reduction in exhaust emissions, such as particulate matter (HC), nitrogen oxide (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and increase in carbon dioxide and oxygen. (Table 6.) The literature report specified that the increase or decrease ofpercentage of O2 depends on the engine speeds which generate power by consuming the amount of oxygen in the engine cylinder. The source of oxygen in the engine cylinder is the amount of air in the cylinder and oxygen contents of biodiesel. Increasing the oxygen flow to the diesel engines reduces particulate emissions by complete combustion of hydrocarbons and increases engine power output. The variation of NOx emission is dependent on the duration of the flame temperature [78–80] in the combustion chamber, speed of the engine and ratio of air–fuel mixture. The reduction in NOx with B25 may be due to residence time of the high gas temperature within the cylinder was shortened or poor fuel to air ratio. In such case, NO is formed from free radicals by decomposing oxygen molecule to oxygen radicals. This favours formation of only NO avoiding another oxide of N that lead to reduction of NOx as shown by Zeldhovich [79] mechanism: For B25 fuel, it was observed that CO emission decreased and O2 and CO2 increased owing to more “Oxygen content” in biodiesel and complete combustion of CO to CO2. It is necessary to study engine performance under partial load as it is commonly operate under this condition. Engine tests were carried out at constant load and variable speed to determine BSFC at part load conditions. Fig. 12 A and Fig. 12Bshows the variation of BTE and BSFC for constant load values reaching from 0.06 kg to 18.13 kg in steps of 4.5. The speed is diverse from 1441 rpm to 1573 rpm by adjusting the throttle Fig. 13 . The effect of the brake power on BTE and BSFC is observed. It is revealed from the figures that as the brake thermal efficiency of the engine decreases for the real diesel from 1440 to 1525 rpm then suddenly increases while for B25 almost remain constant till 1525 rpm. The probable reasons may be the precise quantity of fuel is injected as per requirement which reduces fuel consumption and also irregular combustion is reduced in AVL mode. Brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) is an amount of the fuel efficiency of engine that burns fuel and provides rotational, or shaft power. Performance of engine fuelled with B25 and real sample display almost constant from 1440 to 1505 and 1525 respectively, and BSFC suddenly increases at these rpms. The decrease in BSFC for the biodiesel blends indicates comparable heating value of B25 with respect to real diesel sample. [76,77]. The comparison of esterification conditions of LA with alcohols, catalysed by various heterogeneous acid catalysts (Table 7 ) [51,66 –69] with the newly established heterogeneous photo-catalyst is illustrated. The results achieved using BAFPcPDIL as a photocatalyst for the production of OL are quite acceptable, with very low (10 mg) catalyst loading. As can be realised from (Table 7), BAFPcPDIL displayed very good photocatalytic activity with 10 mg loading compare to other reported heterogeneous catalyst. However, the described heterogeneous catalysts could undergo esterification with very high catalyst quantity and more drastic conditions at different temperatures. As for the newly designed photo-catalyst in present study, the suitable esterification conditions in presence of visible light, with minimum amount at ambient conditions make this protocol comparable with other reported heterogeneous catalysts. Moreover, this protocol, photocatalytic esterification successfully delivered excellent yield of OL with 1:1 M ratio of OA : LA compare to other reported methodologies. However, consumption of more time compensated with the consumtion o only 0.095 W/cm2 energy during the photocataytic esterification."
14,Conclusions,"In summary, we have successfully synthesized a novelBrønsted acid functionalized phthalocyanine on perylene diimide framework knotted with ionic liquid(BAFPcPDIL) and confirmed by characterization techniques. Hammett value (H0) of the BAFPcPDIL photocatalyst has been determined using UV–vis spectroscopy which was interrelated with their catalytic activity. The acidity of BAFPcPDIL was calculated using 4-nitroaniline as an indicator to recognize the Hammett acidity (H0). The H0 function has been widely used as an extent of surface proton levels that is matching with activity of photo-catalyst. The photo-catalytic performance of BAFPcPDIL was assessed by esterification of biomass derived levulinic acid (LA) with n-octyl alcohol (OA) under visible light irradiation at ambient conditions to acquire n-octyl levulinate (OL). Response surface methodology (RSM)with Box–Behnken experimental design (BBD) was applied to explore the consequences of four crucial process variables of esterification such as catalyst loading (A), molar ratio of alcohol to LA (B) andpower of visible light (C), duration in hour (D) on OL yield. The Design-Expert Version 12 software (Stat-Ease, Inc., Minneapolis, USA) was utilized to acquire the optimal reaction parameters and importance of the quadratic model for LA esterification over BAFPcPDIL photo-catalyst. The optimization tool of design expert software was engaged to acquire the optimum reaction parameters,using a set of 29 experimentsfor esterification of LA overBAFPcPDILphoto-catalyst. Study of variance was achieved to conclude the competence and prominence of the quadratic model. The established quadratic model was found to be appropriate and statistically accurate with correlation value ofR-Square 0.9552to calculate the yield of OL. From the model, the optimum conditions for the utmost conversion were found as being a catalyst dosage of (10 mg), alcohol to LA molar ratio (1:1) and power of visible light (12 W lamp), duration (12 h) for completing esterification reaction with 95.58% yield of OL. The plausible photocatalytic mechanismof the esterification reaction was also described. The predicted yield of OL was found to be 87.43% under prescribed the optimum reaction conditions. With optimum conditions, various alkyl esters such as methyl levulinate 92.14% (ML), ethyl levulinate 93.12% (EL), n-propyl levulinate 91.45% (PL), iso-propyl levulinate 92.38% (i-PL), n-butyl levulinate 85.13% (BL), n-pentyl levulinate 86.35% (PenL), n-hexyl levulinate 89.57% (HL), tert-butyl levulinate 91.58% (t-BL), were successfully synthesized with excellent yields. The study was also extended on the blending of OL with diesel sample with 10%, 20% 25% and 30%, found comparable result with blank diesel samples and matched the properties with the real diesel sample. Of these, density (g/cc), kinematic viscosity @ 40 °C (cST), calorific values (MJ/Kg), and cetane number, flash point (°C), fire point (°C), pour point (°C) of the blended samples were found to be analogous with those of the real diesel sample. Moreover, performance and emission characteristics in terms of CO (%), HC (ppm), CO2 (%), and O2 (%), NOx (ppm), opacity (%) of the blended samples were found appreciable changes in properties of 25% blended diesel sample. Additionally, the photocatalyst displayed an admirable recyclability without the loss of photo reactivity after four runs. Thus, BAFPcPDIL photocatalyst incorporated with ionic liquids play the dual role to enhance hydrophilicity and non-covalent interactions, to control over the performance of active species in heterogeneous photocatalyst. Also, this protocol, photocatalytic esterification successfully delivered excellent yield of OL with 1:1 M ratio of LA : OA with loading of 10 mg photocatalyst, compare to other reported methodologies. However, consumption of more time compensated with the consumption of only 0.095 W/cm2 energy during the photocataytic esterification."
