0,Introduction,"The demand for reliable and effective energy alternatives to fossil fuels has been increasingly rising in recent years [1]. Among the developing alterative energy resources, hydrogen is recognized as a promising future energy carrier because it is clean, recyclable, and efficient. One of the critical components of H2 energy technology is to develop a safe, economically feasible and sustainable way of producing H2. Biological H2 production through photolysis of water as well as light-dependent or independent fermentative pathways appears to be the most environment-friendly means for producing H2 [2,3]. Dark fermentation with mainly acidogenic bacteria (such as Clostridium sp.) could produce H2 by converting various organic substrates (e.g., carbohydrates) into soluble metabolites (i.e., volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols) at a very high production rate [4–7]. The soluble products produced from dark fermentation can be further degraded or mineralized via photo fermentation to produce more H2 at the expense of light energy [8–10]. Hence, the highest theoretical H2 yield of 12 mol H2/mol glucose can be achieved through combination of dark and photo-H2 fermentation [11,12]. However, since phototrophic H2 production is sensitively repressed by the presence of ammonia, nitrogen and oxygen in the environment [13], it becomes the rate-limiting step in the integrated dark-photo fermentation process. Consequently, the rate of phototrophic H2 production must be substantially increased before an effective and economically feasible integrated bioH2-producing system could be achieved. As a result, more efforts need to be made to improve the rate of photo fermentation, thereby promoting the efficiency of overall bioH2 production process. Several strategies could be applied to improve the performance of photo fermentation; they include increasing the light illumination efficiency, avoiding inhibitory factors (e.g., ammonia nitrogen, oxygen, etc.), and proper bioreactor design, etc [14–17]. In addition, from the perspective of reaction kinetics, the performance of photo fermentation should also be highly dependent on the composition and the concentration of the substrate used for photo fermentation. The photosynthetic bacteria could have preference over different carbon source for photo fermentative H2 production. Therefore, the photo-H2 production kinetics based on different carbon sources (mostly volatile fatty acids) should be clearly addressed. In this study, engineering approaches were employed to integrate dark/photo-H2 fermentation for enhancing the overall H2 yield. The feasibility of phototrophic hydrogen production was explored by direct utilization of different carbon sources originating from the dark fermentation process (i.e., acetate, butyrate, and lactate). The effect of carbon sources concentration on photo-hydrogen production was also investigated to reveal the cell growth and H2 production kinetics associated with those carbon sources. Finally, the efficiency and stability of long-time operations of the photo-H2 production system using synthetic dark fermentation effluent were assessed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Bacterial strain and cultivation medium,"2.1 Bacterial strain and cultivation medium The bacterial strain used for dark fermentation was Clostridium butyricum CGS5 [4], which was grown on Modified medium-02 consisted of (g/l): sucrose, 17.8; NH4Cl, 0.717; NaHCO3, 15; K2HPO4, 0.125; CuSO4·5H2O, 0.005; CoCl2·5H2O, 0.000125; MgCl2·6H2O, 0.1; MnSO4·6H2O, 0.015; FeSO4·7H2O, 0.025; L-cystein·HCl, 0.5; sodium thioglycolate, 0.5; Resazurin-2127, 0.001. The bacterial used for photo fermentation was an indigenous photosynthetic bacterium, Rhodopseudomonas palustris WP3-5, isolated from a swine wastewater treatment plant located in central Taiwan [16]. The medium used to cultivate R. palustris WP3-5 consisted of (g/l): K2HPO4, 0.5; KH2PO4, 0.5; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.2; NaCl, 0.4; CaCl2·2H2O, 0.05; yeast extract, 0.2; iron citrate solution (1.0 g/l), 5 ml/l; trace element solution, 1 ml. The trace element solution contained (in mg/l) ZnCl2, 70; MnCl2·4H2O, 100; H3BO3, 60; CoCl2·6H2O, 200; CuCl2·2H2O, 20; NiCl2·6H2O, 20; NaMoO4·2H2O, 40; HCl (25%), 1 ml/l. The anaerobic condition was created by sparging the medium with argon gas. The initial pH value of the medium was adjusted to 7.0 by 5.0 N NaOH and the culture temperature was controlled at 32 °C."
3,Operation of bioreactor,"2.2 Operation of bioreactor The bioreactor and operation procedures used for dark fermentation were identical to those described in our recent work [11]. The continuous dark fermentation was operated at 37 °C, pH 6.5, and a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 12 h using Modified medium-02 as the feeding medium [11]. The photobioreactor (PBR) used for cultivation of R. palustris WP3-5 was a 500 ml glass vessel equipped with external light sources (100 W tungsten filament lamps) adjusted to a light intensity of ca. 95 W/m2. The external light source was mounted on both sides of the PBR. The initial cell concentration of R. palustris WP3-5 was controlled at 0.875 g/l. The batch reactors were controlled at 32 °C, pH 7.1, and an agitation rate of 100 rpm. A gas collection device was used to monitor gas production and the gas volume was calibrated to 25 °C and 760 mmHg. The compositions of the gas products with respect to time were measured using gas chromatography [11]. The culture samples were also collected from the sealed glass vessel at designated time intervals to determine cell concentration, pH and residual concentration of VFA. The hydrogen production performance of the combined dark-photo fermentation was mainly assessed by maximum cumulative H2 production and H2 yield. The definition of H2 yield is as follows (Eq. (1)). (1) H 2 yield = Amount of H 2 produced ( mol ) Amount of substrate consumed ( mol )"
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The gas products (mainly H2 and CO2) were analyzed by gas chromatography (Model 9800, China Chromatography, Taipei, Taiwan) using a thermal conductivity detector. The carrier gas was argon. The column (inner diameter = 2.159 mm; height = 4 m) was packed with Porapak Q (China Chromatography, Taipei, Taiwan) [11]. The volatile fatty acids and ethanol were also detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). HPLC equipped with a refraction index detector (RID-10A, Waters, USA) was also used to detect sucrose, volatile fatty acid and ethanol in the filtered (0.2 mm) supernatant of culture broth during bioH2 production. The column used in HPLC analysis was an ICSep ICE-COREGEL 87H3 column (Transgenomic, USA). The mobile phase was 0.008 N H2SO4 with a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The injection sample volume was 20 ml and the column temperature was controlled at 70 °C. The light intensity on the reactor wall was measured with a LI-250 light meter with a LI-200SA pyranometer sensor (LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, Nebraska, USA). This light meter gives a unit of W/m2 for the measured light intensity. Cell concentration in the culture was determined by optical density (OD) measurement using a spectrophotometer (model U-2001, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The OD values were then converted to dry cell weight concentration via proper calibration [11]. The NH3–N concentration was measured by using ammonia photometer (Model HI 93715, Hanna Instruments, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Composition of effluent from continuous dark fermentation,"3.1 Composition of effluent from continuous dark fermentation To identify the composition of the effluent of dark fermentation, continuous dark fermentation culture of C. butyricum CGS5was conducted using sucrose as the sole carbon source [11]. The composition of dark fermentation effluent was shown in Table 1 . The major soluble metabolites during dark fermentation with C. butyricum CGS5 were formate, acetate, lactate, butyrate and ethanol at a concentration of 125, 556, 2993, 5468 and 17 mg/l, respectively. The follow-up investigations of carbon source effects on photo-H2 fermentation were closely based on the soluble metabolites compositions obtained from the aforementioned dark fermentation experiments."
7,Photo-H2 production performance on different carbon sources,"3.2 Photo-H2 production performance on different carbon sources Each of major soluble metabolites of dark H2 fermentation [17] (namely, formate, lactate, acetate, butyrate, and ethanol) was used as the sole carbon source for phototropic H2 production. The effect of different carbon sources on H2 production was examined in batch cultures containing an initial carbon source concentration of 1.0 g/L and an initial pH of 7.0. Fig. 1 shows that acetate, lactate, and butyrate were readily converted into bioH2 with R. palustris WP3-5, whereas formate and ethanol could not be assimilated by the WP3-5 strain. The maximum H2 production rate was 12.7 ml/h/l (on acetate), 11.3 ml/h/l (on lactate), and 12.2 ml/h/l (on butyrate). The H2 yield was 2.24, 4.37, and 6.75 mol H2/mol substrate, on acetate, lactate and butyrate, respectively. The H2 content in biogas was 92.1 ± 3.1% (on acetate), 91.4 ± 2.1% (on lactate), and 93.0 ± 3.7 (on butyrate). The carbon sources utilization was up to 100%, except for formate and ethanol (Table 2 ). The cell concentration in the bioreactor was also up to 6 g/L. Therefore, the major soluble metabolites (acetate, lactate, and butyrate) of dark fermentation could be used for the growth and bioH2 production with R. palustris WP3-5. Although the H2 production rate was similar for the three carbon sources, the H2 yield tended to increase in the order of a butyrate > lactate > acetate."
8,Kinetics of cell growth and photo-H2 production using acetate as carbon source,"3.3 Kinetics of cell growth and photo-H2 production using acetate as carbon source Literature shows that the type and concentration of carbon substrate are critical factors affecting the fermentation kinetics of biohydrogen production [6]. The experiments mentioned earlier also show that acetate was indeed a major product in the dark fermentative effluent (Table 1). Thus, the effect of acetate concentration on H2 production with photosynthetic bacteria (such as R. palustris WP3-5) should be investigated [18]. In this study, acetate was used as the sole carbon source for phototropic production of H2 and the effect of acetate concentration (CHAc) on H2 production was examined in batch cultures containing different CHAc (1.0–5.0 g/L). Fig. 2 shows that R. palustris WP3-5 could produce bioH2 at all CHAc used. The H2 production rate increased with increasing acetate concentration from 1.0 to 4.0 g/L, while it leveled off when CHAc was further increased to 5.0 g/L. The optimal H2 production rate was obtained at CHAc = 4.0 g/L with a value of 19.8 ml/h/L. The H2 yield obtained from using acetate reached a maximum of 3.46 mol H2/mol acetate at CHAc = 3 g/L and then decreased when acetate concentration was increased to 4.0 and 5.0 g/L. Nevertheless, at all acetate concentrations used (1.0–5.0 g/L), the acetate-based H2 yield was over 68% of the theoretical yield and the H2 content in the biogas was over 91% (Table 3 ). The acetate utilization was nearly 100% at CHAc = 1.0 and 2.0 g/L, over 77% at CHAc = 3.0 and 4.0 g/L, but decreased to 47% when CHAc was increased to 5.0 g/L (Table 3). The trend of cell concentration was similarly to the results of H2 production rate. The cell concentration was up to 6.48 g/L at CHAc = 4.0 g/L (Table 3). The kinetics describing cell growth and H2 production are valuable information for bioreactor design and process scale-up for bioH2 production [19]. Unfortunately, very little work has been devoted to identifying such kinetic characteristics, especially for pure H2-producing bacterial strains. In this work, a thorough kinetic study was conducted to provide kinetic information of growth and H2 production of R. palustris WP3-5 while using acetate, lactate, and butyrate, respectively, as the carbon source for H2 production. The dependence of cell growth rate of R. palustris WP3-5 on acetate concentration was described by Monod-type (Eq. (2)) kinetic models indicated below. (2) μ = μ max S K S + S where μ denotes the specific growth rate (h−1), S denotes carbon substrate concentration (g/L), μ max denotes the maximum specific growth rate (h−1), and KS denotes the half-saturation constant (g/L). The Monod-type model fitted the experimental results with a R 2 value of 0.909 (Fig. 3 a). The estimated parameters for Monod-type model (i.e., μ max and KS ) were 0.06 h−1 and 1.42 g/L, respectively. In addition, the dependence of H2 production rate on acetate concentration was also described by Michaelis–Menten (M–M) model (Eq. (3)). The model could describe the experimental data quite well with a R 2 value of 0.860 (Fig. 3b). (3) v = v max S K m + S where v represents the specific H2 production rate (ml/h/l), v max represents the maximum H2 production rate (ml/h/l); Km represents the Michaelis constant (g/L). The estimated values of ν max and Km from M–M model were 17.68 ml/h/L and 0.265 g/L, respectively."
9,Kinetics of cell growth and photo-H2 production using lactate as carbon source,"3.4 Kinetics of cell growth and photo-H2 production using lactate as carbon source Lactate was present with a significant amount in the dark fermentative effluent (Table 1). Therefore, in this study, lactate, was used as the sole carbon source for phototropic production of H2. The effect of lactate concentration on H2 production was examined in batch cultures containing different initial lactate concentrations (1.0–5.0 g/L). Fig. 4 shows that R. palustris WP3-5 could produce bioH2 at all the lactate concentration (CHLa) used (i.e., 1.0–5.0 g/L). The H2 production rate increased with an increase in lactate concentration from 1.0 to 5.0 g/L. The highest H2 production rate (17.0 ml/h/L) occurred at a lactate concentration of 5.0 g/L, However, the highest H2 yield (4.17 mol H2/mol lactate) took place when CHLa = 1.0 g/L, while the H2 yield decreased slightly for CHLa = 2.0–5.0 g/L (Fig. 4). For all the lactate concentration used (1.0–5.0 g/L), the H2 yield was over 52% of theoretically maximum value (Table 4 ). The lactate utilization was up to 100% for CHLa = 1.0–2.0 g/L, dropped to 85% at CHLa = 3.0 g/L, while decreased to 66% for CHLa = 4.0–5.0 g/L (Table 4). The cell concentration was similarly for all the lactate concentration tested (Table 4). The dependence of cell growth rate of R. palustris WP3-5 on lactate concentration could be described by a Monod-type kinetic model (Eq. (2)) with a good agreement (R 2 = 0.984) (Fig. 5 a). The estimated parameters for the Monod-type model (i.e., μ max and KS ) were 0.08 h−1 and 0.13 g/L, respectively. In addition, the dependence of H2 production rate on lactate concentration was also described by Michaelis–Menten (M–M) model (Eq. (3)). The model could describe the experimental data quite well with a R 2 value of 0.971 (Fig. 5b). The estimated values of ν max and Km from M–M model were 17.33 ml/h/L and 0.64 g/L, respectively. Those estimated kinetic constants could help understand the kinetic properties of using R. palustris WP3-5 for bioH2 production from lactate, which have not been mentioned in the literature to date. In addition, those kinetic parameters could also be useful for bioreactor design and scale-up for phototrophic H2 production processes."
10,Kinetics of cell growth and photo-H2 production using butyrate as carbon source,"3.5 Kinetics of cell growth and photo-H2 production using butyrate as carbon source Butyrate is also a typical major soluble product in dark fermentation [20] and was found to be the predominant soluble metabolite in the effluent of continuous dark fermentation converting sucrose to H2 using C. butyricum CGS5 (Table 1). Therefore, the effect of butyrate concentration (CHBu) on phototropic H2 production with photosynthetic bacteria (such as R. palustris WP3-5) should be investigated under different initial butyrate concentrations (1.0–5.0 g/L). Fig. 6 shows that R. palustris WP3-5 could produce bioH2 at CHBu = 1.0–5.0 g/L and reached the highest H2 production rate (11.67 ml/h/L) at CHBu = 2.0 g/L. However, the H2 production rate started to decrease when butyrate concentration was higher than 2.0 g/L. Like H2 production rate, the H2 yield on butyrate also decreased as CHBu was increased from 1.0 to 5.0 g/L. The highest H2 yield (6.39 mol H2/mol butyrate) was obtained at CHBu = 1.0 g/L. The butyrate utilization was up to 100% at 1.0 g/L of initial butyrate concentration, but gradually decreased when the butyrate concentration increased. The substrate utilization efficiency and H2 production rate for butyrate was markedly lower than that for acetate and lactate. This may be due to more significant substrate inhibition effect of butyrate as will be discussed later. The dependence of cell concentration on CHBu was similar to that of H2 production rate, but the highest cell concentration (up to 7.84 g/L at CHBu = 2.0 g/L) was slightly higher than that obtained from using acetate (6.48 g/L) and lactate (6.76 g/L) (Tables 3–5 ). The dependence of cell growth rate of R. palustris WP3-5 on butyrate concentration was described by Monod-type (Eq. (2)) and substrate inhibition (Eq. (4)) kinetic models indicated below. (4) μ = μ max S K S + S + S 2 / K I Where μ denotes the specific growth rate (h−1), S denotes carbon substrate concentration (g/L), μ max denotes the maximum specific growth rate (h−1), and KS denotes the half-saturation constant (g/L), and KI represents the inhibition constant (g/L). The substrate inhibition model seemed to fit the experimental results better with a R 2 value of 0.999, while prediction with Monod-type model (R 2 = 0.955) displayed a larger deviation from the data (Fig. 7 a and Table 6 ). On substrate inhibition model, the estimated μ max, KS , and KI values were 0.04 h−1, 1.87 g/L, and 2.58 g/L, respectively. The estimated parameters for Monod-type model (i.e., μ max and KS ) were 0.02 h−1 and 0.06 g/L, respectively. In addition, the dependence of H2 production rate on butyrate concentration was also described by substrate inhibition model (Eq. (5)). The model could describe the experimental data quite well with a R 2 value of 0.994 (Fig. 7b). (5) ν = ν max S K m + S + S 2 / K I where v represents the specific H2 production rate (ml/h/l), v max represents the maximum H2 production rate (ml/h/l), Km represents the Michaelis constant (g/L), and KI represents the inhibition constant (g/L). On substrate inhibition model, the estimated ν max, Km , and KI values were 15.6 ml/h/L, 1.08 g/L, and 1.69 g/L, respectively (Table 6). To our best knowledge, this is the first report describing the substrate inhibition kinetics on cell growth and hydrogen production of R. palustris species when using butyrate as the carbon source. This information is quite important since butyrate is often the dominant soluble metabolite of high-rate dark fermentation processes [20–22], and thus a critical component in the dark fermentation effluent during sequential dark-photo fermentation [12]."
11,Continuous photo-H2 production using synthetic dark fermentation effluent as the carbon sources,"3.6 Continuous photo-H2 production using synthetic dark fermentation effluent as the carbon sources With appropriate dilution (5 or 10 fold dilution), the dark fermentation metabolites mentioned above were further utilized as the feeding substrate to carry out continuous photo-H2 fermentation with R. palutris WP3-5 under the condition of 32 °C, 100 W/m2 irradiation and 96 h HRT. As shown in Fig. 8 , the H2 production rate in photo fermentation on synthetic soluble metabolites of dark fermentation was fairly stable, with a mean value of 7.37 ml/h/L (using 5-fold diluted synthetic soluble metabolites (5f-DSSM)) and 7.02 ml/h/L (using 10-fold diluted synthetic soluble metabolites (10f-DSSM)) (Table 7 and Fig. 8b). Total hydrogen yield calculated from sequential dark and photo fermentation (SDPF) reached a high value of 10.30 and 11.97 mol H2/mol sucrose or 5.15 and 5.99 mol H2/mol hexose when using 5f-DSSM and 10f-DSSM, respectively. These results are quite good when compared with the values reported in the literature (Table 8 ). The cell concentration also reached a steady-state value of nearly 9.91 and 13.5 g/L over a 15-day operation with 5f-DSSM and 10f-DSSM, respectively (Fig. 8b). The H2 content in biogas was essentially constant at 92.1 and 91.2% with 5f-DSSM and 10f-DSSM, respectively (Fig. 8a). Meanwhile, nearly 96.2 and 94.9% of the ammonium content entering the photo fermentation process was consumed when using 5f-DSSM and 10f-DSSM as substrate, respectively (Fig. 8 and Table 7). To date, most published investigations on the sequential dark-photo fermentation (SDPF) were conducted with batch operations [23–26]. In this study, we demonstrated that the SDPF process could also be operated stably on continuous mode for over 30 days. In addition, the H2 production yield obtained from this stable continuous process is higher or comparable to most of the reported values (Table 8). As the commercially viable bioH2 processes should inherit the merit of high H2 yield, using the SDPF process becomes inevitable when developing practical bioH2 production process. Therefore, the results presented in this work are valuable and useful for the scale-up and commercialization of the integrated H2 production processes combining dark and photo fermentation."
12,Conclusions,"An indigenous photosynthetic bacterium, R. palustris WP3-5, isolated from a swine wastewater treatment system in central Taiwan could covert major soluble metabolites (e.g., acetate, lactate, and butyrate) in dark fermentation effluent into bioH2. The H2 production rate on acetate was higher than from lactate and butyrate, while the H2 yield on butyrate was higher than acetate and lactate. Using acetate and lactate as substrate, the dependence of cell growth and H2 production rate on carbon substrate followed the Monod-type and Michaelis–Menten kinetics, respectively. However, substrate inhibition took place when using butyrate as substrate. This study also showed that with proper dilution (e.g., 5–10 fold dilution), the dark fermentation effluents could be fed continuously to the culture of R. palustris WP3-5, producing H2 at the highest yield of 11.97 mol H2/mol sucrose or 5.99 mol H2/mol hexose. The continuous dark-photo fermentation could be stably operated for over 30 days using C. butyricum CGS5 for dark fermentation and R. palustris WP3-5 for photo fermentation. This indicates the potential of using those isolated strains for high-yield bioH2 production in an integrated dark-photo fermentation process."
