0,Introduction,"Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) involves hepatocellular injury induced by consumption of ethanol. ALD is a major public health hazard in developed as well as in developing world. In spite of very good scientific efforts made to understand the pathogenesis of ALD, there remains no effective therapy for this disease. Most of the evidence shows that both oxidative stress and abnormal cytokine production play an important etiological role in the pathogenesis of ALD. Therefore agents possessing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties are promising therapeutic interventions for ALD. A large number of research studies have suggested that oxidative stress plays an important role in the development of ALD. Ethanol intake causes accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS); like superoxide, hydroxyl radical, and hydrogen peroxide (Nordmann et al., 1992). These reactive moieties cause lipid peroxidation (LPO) of cellular membranes, oxidation of protein and DNA, ultimately leading to injury of hepatocytes (Kurose et al., 1997; Navasumrit et al., 2000; Rouach et al., 1997). Reduced glutathione (GSH) is one of the most prominent defense molecules in the liver and plays a pivotal role to maintain redox homeostasis (Dickinson and Forman, 2002). A number of research studies have shown evidence that acute ethanol administration decreases hepatic GSH content (Masini et al., 1994; Shaw et al., 1983; Song et al., 2003). Selective depletion of mitochondrial GSH was also reported in ethanol induced liver toxicity (Fernández-Checa et al., 1993). Aberrant cytokine metabolism especially TNF-α is another major feature of ALD (McClain and Cohen, 1989). Intragastrically administered ethanol induces the activation of NFκ-B, which accounts for an increased synthesis of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α. TNF-α plays an important role in the development of liver injury produced by ethanol in rat models (French, 2001; Uesugi et al., 2001). In hepatocytes, activation of NFκ-B by TNF-α activates anti-apoptotic signaling pathways that abolishes TNF-α-induced hepatocytes damage; thus TNF-α mediated toxicity to the hepatocytes is perceptible only when the NFκ-B signal transduction machinery is not working in a well controlled manner (Uesugi et al., 2001). Plant products including extracts and active principles have been used to fight against various inflammation mediated diseases and cancer (Balunas and Kinghorn, 2005). Nutritionally used items like vegetables fruits and spices are rich in phenolics and terpenoids (Wagner and Elmadfa, 2003). Extracts derived from medicinal plants also have terpenoids as their major constituent. The antioxidant property is ubiquitous in these compounds. Monoterpenes are naturally occurring plant hydrocarbons composed of two isoprene units. They are widely distributed in plant flora and are best known in essential oils. There are number of dietary sources of monoterpenes like in orange and citrus peel oils, caraway, dill and green leafy vegetables, cherry and spearmint, lemongrass oil (Crowell, 1999). The monoterpenes have been shown to have antioxidant, chemotherapeutic and chemopreventive effects in different models of cancer (Gould, 1997). Perillyl alcohol (POH) is p-mentha, 1,7-diene-6-ol or 4-isopropenyl cyclohexene carbinol. In recent year's considerable scientific efforts have been done experimentally on this compound and the outcomes shows that POH could be used for therapeutic as well as preventive purpose in different cancer related disease. Many studies on animals reflects that POH is effective in prevention of prostate (Jeffers et al., 1995), liver (Mills et al., 1995), skin (Barthelman et al., 1998), lung (Lantry et al., 1997), pancreas (Stayrook et al., 1997), colon (Reddy et al., 1997) cancer and also been shown to inhibit metastasis (Broitman et al., 1996). One of the previous findings also depict that POH causes apoptosis to cancerous cells without affecting normal cells by increasing the expression of Bak protein (Stayrook et al., 1997). Different hypothesis have been raised about the mechanism of POH action but still obscurity is there. However it has been reported to act possibly by altering mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptors; induce transforming growth factor receptors; decreasing Ras protein synthesis and inducing Phase I and Phase II liver detoxification system. It also caused decreased cyclin D1 protein synthesis in G1 phase that may cause G1 arrest, inhibition of small G protein isoprenylation and CoQ synthesis (Belanger, 1998). The present study was designed to examine the preventive role of POH on ethanol induced acute hepatotoxicity and to assess the effect of POH on liver antioxidant machinery and inflammation for the plausible mechanistic investigation using rat as an experimental model."

A significant (p <0.001) increase of the MDA formation was found in the ethanol treated group when compared with control. We have observed that pretreatment with POH at both D1 and D2 leads to the significant (p <0.05 and p <0.001 respectively) prevention of membrane damage when compared to ethanol treated group (Fig. 1 ). No significant difference was found in the MDA level between control and only D2 groups.
20,"Perillyl alcohol attenuates the serum LDH, AST and ALT activity","3.2 Perillyl alcohol attenuates the serum LDH, AST and ALT activity Protective effect of POH on serum LDH, AST and ALT level observed. Significance change in these parameters was found in the ethanol treated groups as compared to control (p <0.001). Pretreatment with POH was found significantly (p <0.01, p <0.001) effective in the normalization of these markers when compared to ethanol treated group (Figs. 2–4 ). POH alone did not show any significant difference as compared to control."
21,Perillyl alcohol pretreatment restored the hepatic GSH level,"3.3 Perillyl alcohol pretreatment restored the hepatic GSH level Protective effect of POH on hepatic GSH level was marked. The level of GSH was depleted significantly (p <0.001) in ethanol treated group as compared to control group.

24,Effects of perillyl alcohol on the translocation of NFκ-B,"3.6 Effects of perillyl alcohol on the translocation of NFκ-B Nuclear factor κ-B plays a critical role in chronic inflammatory diseases and its activation is essential for cytokine production. Here we have observed remarkable activation of NFκ-B (NFκ-B DNA binding Activity) in ethanol exposed group when compared with the vehicle treated control group (p <0.001). Pretreatment with POH was found to restrict the NFκ-B activation in groups III and IV significantly (p <0.05, p <0.01). No significance difference was observed between only POH treated and control animals as for as the activation of NFκ-B is concern (Fig. 7 )."
25,Discussion,"In the present era attention has been given to natural compounds for the prevention of different human disease. One such class of compound, POH comes under the category of monoterpene, is nontoxic ubiquitous (Crowell, 1999), and anticarcinogenic (Barthelman et al., 1998). Our results showed that supplementation of POH before ethanol administration leads to prevention of hepatic injury. Consumption of alcohol (ethanol) is a leading cause of diseases and death worldwide. There is a number of findings associated with the ethanol induce toxicity, oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokine production thought to be the leading putative etiological factor. Oxidative stress which is generally known to result of the imbalance between generation of ROS, reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and their clearance by antioxidant defense system i.e. imbalance between pro-oxidants and antioxidants (Forman et al., 2002; Nordmann et al., 1992). Hepatic LPO by ethanol ingestion has been largely known to serve as bioindicator of oxidative stress induced injury in animal experimental module as well as in human studies gone through clinical trials (Meagher et al., 1999). In the present study we have observed a noticeable increase of the LPO in ethanol ingested group and further it was found that there is a significant attenuation of LPO by POH pretreatment. In spite of lipid peroxidation ethanol induced liver injury mediated through oxidative stress is associated with protein carbonyl formation, formation of the 1-hydroxyl ethyl radical, formation of lipid radicals, and decreases in hepatic antioxidant defense, especially GSH (French et al., 1993; Polavarapu et al., 1998; Rouach et al., 1997). GSH is the major antioxidative tripeptide in the cell and plays pivotal role in the detoxification of toxicants, metabolism of nutrients and regulation of various pathways to maintain cellular homeostasis (Wu et al., 2004). Different enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions could be involved in GSH mediated scavenging of free radicals and other oxygen species. It has been observed that acute and chronic intake of ethanol causes GSH depletion both in time as well as dose dependent fashion (Fernandez-Checa et al., 1998; Kurose et al., 1997). Chronic alcoholics have been reported to have deplete level of GSH (Jewell et al., 1986). Various mechanisms are thought to be associated with the hepatic GSH depletion by ethanol intake probably by oxidative stress, increased lipid peroxidation, binding to acetaldehyde and by increasing GSH efflux from the liver and/or by inhibiting the biosynthesis, could be responsible for the depletion of hepatic GSH (Garcia-Ruiz et al., 1995; Iimuro et al., 1997; Videla and Valenzuela, 1982). Homeostatic balance of GSH activity could limit the oxidative stress and improve ethanol mediated hepatic toxicity (Garcia-Ruiz et al., 1995). In the present study we have shown that ethanol ingestion causes significant depletion in the hepatic GSH which is in agreement with the previous observations (Garcia-Ruiz et al., 1995; Song et al., 2003). Pretreatment with POH improves the level of hepatic GSH significantly and also shows to enhance the actitivity of GSH dependent enzymes like GPx, GR, and G6PD.Catalse responsible for the detoxification of H2O2 has also been found to be elevated significantly in POH pretreatment group. Our results suggest that one of the major therapeutic effects of POH in ethanol induced liver injury might result from its direct free radical scavenging property including the potentiation of antioxidant defense system. Earlier study on POH against Fe-NTA induced nephrotoxicity from our lab (Jahangir and Sultana, 2007) is also in agreement with our findings. The exact mechanism of action is still not elucidated but POH have action on array of cellular factors which control cell growth and differentiation. It has been shown to increase mannose-6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor-II receptors, increase tissue growth factor beta receptors, apoptosis to cancerous cells, decrease Ras protein prenylation, decrease ubiquinone synthesis, and induce Phase I and Phase II detoxification systems (Belanger, 1998). So it can be suggested that POH may involve some pathway other than the induction of antioxidant defense system in ethanol induced liver injury. Proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α plays an important role in the development of liver injury by ethanol (McClain et al., 2004; Naveau et al., 2005; Yin et al., 1999). Pathogenic role TNF-α has been elucidated in both animal and patient with alcoholic liver disease (McClain et al., 1999) and in alcoholic hepatitis. Oxidative stress is known to stimulate the release of these cytokines (Albano, 2002). Present study provided direct evidence that alcohol administration significantly increases intrahepatic TNF-α. Oxidative stress can also initiate or amplify inflammation through upregulation of several genes involved in the inflammatory response. One such gene is NF-κB, whose activation results in the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines (Pahl, 1999). Oxygen free radicals and TNF-α released during inflammation could activate NF-κB, a redox-sensitive transcription factor, and could activate the subsequent inflammatory cascade. Although interaction between oxidative stress and NFκ-B signaling is not fully defined, it has been supported by different studies that activation of NFκ-B by oxidative stress can be checked by antioxidants and reactive oxygen species scavengers like l-cysteine, NAC, thiols, green tea polyphenols, and vitamin E (Nomura et al., 2000; Schulze-Osthoff et al., 1997). Peroxides, OH radicals, (Schreck et al., 1991) and the cells over expressing activity of antioxidant enzymes (Schmidt et al., 1995) have increased NFκ-B activity. The above findings show the involvement of ROS in NF-k B activation. Number of research findings shows that ethanol ingestion cause oxidative stress and release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and activation of NFκ-B (Nanji et al., 1999). Our present study gives the supporting evidence for the induction and activation of NFκ-B in ethanol treated group. Previous studies show that POH has anticancer (Burke et al., 2002; Karlson et al., 1996; Stark et al., 1995) properties in different cancer animal modules. It has also been reported that POH is able to block various important signaling pathways like Ras and ERK (Belanger, 1998; Bishop et al., 2003; da Fonseca et al., 2006). POH is also known to inhibit NFκ-B signaling in lymphoma cells (Berchtold et al., 2005). Findings of our study is in agreement with the above and shows that perillyl alcohol attenuates ethanol induced liver injury by inhibiting the oxidative stress, inflammation and NFκ-B translocation to the nucleus or activation of its transcription. In conclusion our study demonstrated that POH a monoterpene was significantly beneficial in the prevention of ethanol induced liver toxicity possibly by scavenging reactive free radicals via boosting endogenous antioxidant system, inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine and also by inhibition of NFκ-B activation, implicating that the agent may be further restrict the activation of a series of its downstream effectors. Present findings recommend that POH may be used as a prototype for the prevention of ethanolic liver injury. Further research to explicate the shielding effects of POH in ethanol induced liver damage is important and will provide more evidence for the exploitation of its broader remedial usage."
