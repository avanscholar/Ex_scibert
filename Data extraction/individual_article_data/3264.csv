0,Introduction,"Developments in gene therapy have allowed the use of various genetic materials, which are involved in a wide range of biological processes, as therapeutic agents and diagnostic tools. For last several decades, the increasing researches related to understanding of the processes involved in the delivery of DNA, have offered to the construction of highly diverse, complex polymers for biomedical applications. As nucleic acids are charged and significant susceptibility to enzymatic degradation, most of the developed vehicles are required to form compacted state of polyplexes and equip with modules to encounter both extracellular (serum degradation, immune clearance, and non-specific binding with proteins) and intracellular barriers (poor endosomal escape and degraded of DNA in the lysosome) [1,2]. Two types of vectors (viral and non-viral) have been used in a wide range of gene delivery applications. While viral vectors have the advantage of high transfection efficacy, the therapeutic applications of viruses remain problematic due to safety issues and difficulty in large-scale production, leading to the development of non-viral alternatives [3]. Although compared with viral vectors, non-viral systems show reduced transfection efficacy and need to be equipped with modules to overcome biological barriers, they have several advantages including being biologically safe and they have an unlimited cargo size [4]. Among the various non-viral carriers, polyester amines (PAEs) are one of the most well-known hydrolytically degradable polymers that are being developed for biomedical use with poly(amido-amines) [5,6,7] polyesters [8,9] and poly(ortho ester)s [10,11]. Due to their biodegradable property and the ease of synthesis and processing, PAEs have gained a great deal of interest in the past few years for combinatorial studies. Akinc et al. developed a library of 140 PAEs by documenting the reaction of a primary amine or secondary amine monomer with a diacrylate monomer with screening for lysosomal trafficking, transfection efficiency, and cellular uptake of DNA [12]. The favorable results led the authors to further study using several identified polymers for plasmid DNA vaccination [13]. Using sugar alcohol based carriers in nucleic acid delivery is an obvious choice for improving safety and reducing the toxicity. Sugar alcohol is a class of polyols in which a carbonyl group of aldose or ketose in sugar is reduced to the hydroxyl group. It has been exploited as attractive material for sugar substitutes [14], laxative [15], and hyperosmolar agents for opening the tight junction [16]. Recently, several features of sugar alcohols such as their metabolism in the human body, showing hyperosmotic properties, inexpensiveness and easy availability from renewable sources, and providing functional groups for further modification have led to their use in designing for biomaterials. Similar to Akin et al. [12] a series of PEI sugar alcohol diacrylate with amine functional groups was synthesized via the Michael addition method by Cho et al. and our laboratory. These polymers demonstrate hyperosmotic properties with high transfection efficacy and low cytotoxicity. The addition of PEI to polyol-based carriers can further stimulate the caveolae-mediated endocytic pathway, contributing to the effective loading of genetic materials without lysosomal degradation. This review is mainly focused on exploring the potential of sugar alcohol-based hyperosmotic polymers as gene carriers through the discussion of several in vitro and in vivo results, which have been published or are in preparation for publication. Moreover, we emphasize the role of the sugar alcohol backbone within developed vectors for better understanding of cell type-specific delivery systems for future studies."
1,Structure activity relationship study and mechanism of caveolae-mediated endocytosis of sugar alcohol-based nanocarriers,
2,Background of sugar alcohols,"2.1 Background of sugar alcohols Modern progress in food technology is aimed at the manufacture of artificial sweeteners to satisfy consumer needs. Eight sugar alcohols are considered to be sugar substitutes and have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, including erythritol, hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, isomalt, lactitol, maltitol, mannitol, sorbitol, and xylitol [17]. These artificial sweeteners occur naturally in plants and are added to various products, including confections, baked goods, toothpastes to reduce dental caries, and lotions. These also help retain product moisture and, in most cases, improve the overall quality of a food product that will be slightly less sweet compared to products sweetened with table sugar. Sugar alcohols, also known as polyhydric alcohols (or polyols), can be obtained either by the reduction of an aldehyde or carbonyl group of the carbohydrate to a hydroxyl group or by the hydrogenation of sugars [18]. Most of these substances are derived from their corresponding aldose sugars and are called alditols. For example, reduction of the glucose aldehyde group yields sorbitol, whereas reduction of the mannose carbonyl group results in mannitol. In general, sugar alcohols can be categorized depending on the type of sugar being hydrogenated. The major characteristics of each sugar alcohol are shown in Table 1 ."
3,Delivery mechanism of sugar alcohols: caveolae-mediated endocytosis,"2.2 Delivery mechanism of sugar alcohols: caveolae-mediated endocytosis Poly(amino ester)s (PAEs), a class of cationic polymer, are one of the most well known hydrolytically degradable polymers being developed for biomedical applications. Due to their biodegradability and ease of synthesis and processing, PAEs have gained a great deal of interest in the past few years for combinatorial studies [31–36]. The typical strategy of synthesizing PAEs is to chemically conjugate a primary amine or secondary amine monomer with a diacrylate monomer [37]. To enhance their efficacy and draw potentials, Cho and our group introduced a series of sugar alcohols in polymeric structures to (i) reduce charge density, (ii) stimulate caveolae-mediated endocytosis and (iii) specifically target cell surface receptors (Table 2 ) (Fig. 1 ). Caveolae are flask-shaped, cholesterol-rich plasma membrane invaginations that are a subtype of cholesterol-enriched membrane micro-domains [38]. Caveolin, the main protein component of caveolae, helps to not only regulate diverse biological functions such as cellular adhesion [39,40], cellular migration [41,42], vesicular trafficking [43,44], signal transduction [45] and angiogenesis [46] but also stabilizes the flask-shaped morphology of caveolae as a scaffold protein. Caveolae-mediated endocytosis (CvME) is an endocytosis pathway that can avoid the lysosomal degradation process. Interestingly, nearly a decade ago, Wang et al. found that osmotic stress triggers CvME of plasma membrane domains, which is mediated by the Src-kinase pathway, while downregulating clathrin and fluid-phase endocytosis [47]. These promising results led Park et al. to design a new non-viral vector, polymannitol-based gene transporter (PMT), which shifted the uptake route to CvME using the hyperosmotic activity of PMT. Western blot and fluorescent microscopy analysis demonstrated that polymer osmotic activity can have a significant effect on the determination of the endocytosis pathway by activating Src-kinase, phosphorylating caveolin-1 and subsequently inducing caveolae budding with CvME. These results strongly indicated that PMT/DNA complexes efficiently avoid lysosomal degradation by serving as a caveolae stimulant for endocytosis and substantially affecting the uptake mechanism [48]. Other factors for stimulating CvME are particle size and ligand modification. Reduction of particle size can yield higher cellular uptake efficiency levels and more efficiently facilitate CvME than larger sized polymers, resulting in an improved delivery system. Wang and coworkers showed that PEI complexed to DNA-transfected cells as a function of their size, with 20 nm and 40 nm particles entering cells 5–10 times more effectively than 100 nm particles, indicating that polymers should have a minimum radius to achieve effective stimulation of CvME [49]. As mentioned above, as a component of caveolae, caveolin-1 binds and promotes the ordering of multiple molecules and can thereby trigger the rapid internalization of caveolae. Several ligands are internalized by caveolae including folic acid [50], albumin [51], SV40 virus [52], and epidermal growth factor [53]. This improved understanding of the factors for stimulating CvME may help development of strategies to design an efficient non-viral gene transfer system."
4,Design of sugar alcohol-based therapeutic nanoparticles,
5,Glycerol-based polymer as a non-viral vector for gene therapy,"3.1 Glycerol-based polymer as a non-viral vector for gene therapy Glycerol (1,2,3-propanetriol), first discovered in 1779 by Karl W. Scheele, is a highly flexible molecule containing three hydrophilic alcoholic hydroxyl groups with C2 as a prostereogenic center [60]. Because of the viscous liquid and colorless and sweet nature of glycerol, it has been explored for numerous applications in different fields, ranging from the cosmetic industry, as an ingredient in personal care formulations [61], to the food industry, as a sweetener or anti-freeze. In recent years, glycerol-based polymers have attracted a great deal of attention due to their tunable physical and mechanical characteristics and biodegradable and biocompatible properties. To exert a hyperosmotic effect on the glycerol backbone for facilitating the cellular uptake of polymers and to enhance the endosomal buffering capacity of PEI amine groups for faster endosomal release of polyplexes, in 2008, Arote et al. [62] developed degradable PEAs based on glycerol dimethacrylate (GDM) and the 1.2 kDa branched PEI-1.2. Using a modified Michael addition reaction, the authors synthesized polymers containing different GDM:PEI stoichiometric ratios, including GDM/PEI-1.2 (1:1), GDM/PEI-1.2 (1:2), and GDM/PEI-1.2 (1:4), and evaluated whether different feed ratios of hyperosmotic glycerol had an effect on the transfection efficiency of PEAs (Fig. 2 ). Arote et al. [62] initially measured the molecular weight reduction of the polymer to assess the kinetics of ester bonds. PEA dissolved in Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 0.1 g/mL) showed biphasic degradation patterns and slow degradation up to 6 days; however, after 6 days, it showed rapid degradation due to the breakdown of the main chain. Considering that the accumulation of non-degraded polymers has an effect on cell viability, the hydrolysis of ester bonds under physiological conditions indicates the low cytotoxicity of GDM/PEI nanoparticles. To determine whether the hydrolysis of ester bonds in PEAs at different stoichiometric ratios of GDM/PEI polymers could decrease cytotoxicity, the authors then assessed cell compatibility by adding PEA solutions at different concentrations to three cell lines (HeLa, 293T, and HepG2). Compared with non-degradable polymers (PEI 25 kDa), which resulted in less than 30% cell viability in all three cell lines at 40 μg/mL, GDM/PEI polymers resulted in at least 70% cell viability in all three cell lines at the same concentrations. Furthermore, after transfection of 293T cells with different feed ratios of polymers at a N/P ratio (the ratios of moles of the amine groups of cationic polymers to those of the phosphate ones of DNA) of 30 and qualitative verification of GFP reporter gene expression by confocal microscopy, the GFP signal with GDM/PEI polymers was found to be significantly higher than that of PEI 25 kDa. Similar results were observed by measuring GFP via flow cytometry. Based on these two results, which verified the potential of PEAs as an efficient gene carrier, Arote et al. investigated whether the glycerol backbone of GDM/PEI polymers could affect transfection efficiency by measuring packed cell volume (PCV). Interestingly, the reduction in the PCV of cells treated with GDM/PEI complexes containing 3, 4, and 5 wt-% glycerol was similar to that in the PCV of cells treated with pure glycerol, indicating that the high osmolarity of glycerol led to the shrinkage of cells and that this property of glycerol could improve cellular uptake [62]. To examine the ability of polymers in delivering genes in vivo, aerosol administration of the synthesized polymer GDM/PEI-1.2 (1:4) with pEGFP-N2 was conducted. Similar to the in vitro results, the gene loading efficiency of GDM/PEI-1.2 (1:4) was much higher than that of PEI 25 kDa in the lungs [62]. The study by Arote et al. was the first to use sugar alcohol-based nanoparticles to deliver genes into cells. Based on the modified glycerol, further studies have been carried out using glycerol triacrylate (GTA) and similar results as GDM/PEI were seen (Fig. 3 ). Unlike polyplexes prepared with PEI 25 k, the GTA/PEI polyplexes were less toxic and increased GFP fluorescence after aerosol administration, indicating that the glycerol derivative modification on PEI resulted in increased cellular uptake in both in vitro and in vivo conditions [63]."
6,"Lactitol-based biodegradable, targeted polymeric nanoparticle for liver cancer therapy","3.2 Lactitol-based biodegradable, targeted polymeric nanoparticle for liver cancer therapy Lactitol (β-galactoside-sorbitol) monohydrate is an osmotic disaccharide analogue of lactulose, which is composed of d-galactose and d-sorbitol as a crosslinker [64]. Due to its hyperosmotic properties, lactitol has been used in the treatment of constipation [65] and hepatic encephalopathy [66]. As a laxative, lactitol induces increased fecal volume with stimulating peristalsis, resulting in better palatability, acceptance and tolerance and lesser incidence of adverse events compared with lactulose in various clinical trials [15]. Moreover, since lactitol decreases the absorption and production of ammonia and reduces the intestinal pH, it has been frequently used as a first-line agent for hepatic encephalopathy treatment. Polylactitol can act as a multifunctional carrier because d-galactose contributes to liver-specific targeting via specific binding to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), and d-sorbitol has hyperosmotic properties because of the presence of hydroxyl groups. Furthermore, by conjugation with PEI, polylactitol can facilitate the rapid endosomal escape of genes without lysosomal degradation because of the proton sponge effect of PEI [67]. Based on these ideas, Kim et al. recently synthesized liver-directed multifunctional gene delivery systems called poly (lactitol-co-PEI) (PLT). To develop PLT, the authors first prepared lactitol diacrylate (LDA) by mixing lactitol with acryloyl chloride, followed by addition of low molecular weight branched PEI to LDA (Fig. 4 ). In comparison with PEI and Lipofectamine 2000, the PLT polyplex showed high DNA transfection efficiency in HepG2 cells after purification. Furthermore, even in the presence of serum at different concentrations, the luciferase expression level with PLT at a N/P ratio of 20 was much higher than that of PEI/DNA complexes, indicating that PLT might prevent the interaction with serum proteins by shielding of positive surface charges and hydration of polyols (Fig. 5 ). To evaluate the interactions between the poly-galactose parts of PLT and ASGPRs expressed on liver cells, a competition assay was carried out. The expression level of luciferase delivered by PLT nanoparticles was significantly reduced by 6-, 22-, and 57- fold compared with that in the control groups pretreated with free galactose at 10, 20, and 40 mM, respectively, suggesting that the poly-galactose parts of PLT might promote transfection of HepG2 cells via recognizing and binding to ASGPRs. To evaluate which endocytic pathways are used by PLT to deliver plasmid DNA into cells, three different types of metabolic inhibitors have been investigated; chlorpromazine has been assessed in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, both methyl-beta-cyclodextrin and genistein have been assessed in caveolae-mediated endocytosis, and wortmannin has been assessed in fluid-phase endocytosis. In comparison with untreated cells, cells treated with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin and genistein had approximately 147-fold and 28-fold lower transfection efficiency, respectively, of PLT/DNA complexes. However, there was only a slight decrease in transfection efficiency in the treatment of HepG2 cells with chlorpromazine or wortmannin. These results indicated that caveolae-mediated endocytosis is the main route of cellular internalization for PLT polyplexes. To elucidate the role of PLT as a liver-specific non-viral gene vector, in vivo bio-distribution experiments have been performed. Interestingly, the fluorescence signal was 27-fold and 1.5-fold higher in the mouse liver of the PLT group compared with the naked DNA and PEI/DNA groups, respectively, which were similar to the in vitro results of PLT transfection and competition assays (Fig. 6 ). The first trial using polylactitol as a nucleic acid carrier has been performed and highlighted its multifunctional abilities including its hyperosmotic property, liver-specific targeting ability, and gene degradation inhibition within the late endosome and lysosome, which may be attributed to the proton sponge effect of PEI [59]. However, further in vivo studies using PLT will be required to confirm its application as a non-viral gene vector for treating liver-specific diseases."
7,Mannitol-based polymer for gene therapy of the nervous system,"3.3 Mannitol-based polymer for gene therapy of the nervous system Mannitol (1,2,3,4,5,6-hexanehexol) is a naturally occurring sorbitol isomer polyol that is widely used in the food and pharmaceutical industry for controlling elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) in head injury patients [68], increasing the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in uncomplicated postcardiac-surgery patients [25], and increasing the osmotic pressure and urine volume after kidney transplantation. Moreover, since mannitol has a high osmolar property, it has been intra-arterial administered in over 400 patients with brain tumors for passing through the brain blood barrier (BBB) from 1980 [69,70]. Mannitol also exhibits a crystallization form at room temperature and is poorly absorbed from the intestines, owing to its capability to transiently pass through the BBB, and thus has been used with brain delivering nanoparticles in several studies [71,72]. The value of nanomaterial-based delivery has become desirable for introducing foreign nucleic acids such as siRNA into the exosome, which are limited of broad application by its sensitive to degradation, renal filtration during circulation in the bloodstream, and inefficient cellular uptake. RNA interference (RNAi) is a highly conserved process that post-transcriptionally regulates gene expression. Several studies have demonstrated the potential for RNAi as a therapeutic alternative treatment approach to conventional molecular medicines [73]. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are the most well studied non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and play important roles in post-transcriptionally regulating gene expression by binding to sites in the 3′ untranslated region of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) [74]. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are small ncRNA molecules, 21–26 nucleotides in length, that effect gene silencing by inducing the degradation of corresponding mRNAs in a sequence-specific manner [75]. For successful implementation of RNAi, careful design of an ncRNA delivery vehicle is necessary due to the unstable and negatively charged profile of ncRNAs. Without using mannitol to aid passing through the BBB, Park et al. generated PMT conjugated with the rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) peptide, which has high BBB penetration ability, using polyethylene glycol (PEG). To examine whether the nanoparticles could penetrate the BBB, three different types of in vitro BBB models were constructed: a monolayer culture of a mouse brain capillary endothelial cell line, co-culture of a mouse brain capillary endothelial cell line and rat astrocytoma cell line with contact, and co-culture of both cell lines without contact. After recording the transepithelial/transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) of BBB models using an EVOM resistance meter, those with a TEER of 250 Ohm·cm2 were chosen for permeability assays. To determine whether the mannitol backbone of RVG-PEG-PMT nanoparticles crosses the BBB via the para-cellular route by accelerating the breakdown of tight junctions, RVG-PEG-PEI polymers were used in the control group to measure the integrity of in vitro BBB tight junctions after treatment with both polymers. However, only a small change in the TEER values of the monolayers were observed, indicating that the two nanoparticles did not penetrate the BBB by disrupting tight junctions. To investigate whether RVG-PEG-PMT may internalize at the BBB via other mechanisms, such as through the specific interaction of the surface of BBB endothelial cells with RVG ligands, Park et al. measured the apparent permeability coefficient (Papp, cm/s) of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled RVG-PEG-PMT, PEG-PMT, and RVG-PEG-PEI polymers. The flux of RVG-PEG-PMT/siRNA complexes was 2.2-fold higher than that of PEG-PMT/siRNA complexes, indicating that the RVG ligand plays a key role in the specific interaction with the surface of BBB endothelial cells. Furthermore, to confirm the intracellular mechanism of PMT polyplexes, a competition assay was performed by pre-treating cells with free RVG peptides. The results demonstrated that the BBB penetration of RVG-PEG-PMT/siRNA complexes may be attributed to receptor-mediated transcytosis through the binding of RVG ligands to nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) receptors. Moreover, to ensure the brain-specific targeting of RVG-PEG-PMT, a bio-distribution assay was conducted. Among the six different groups (PBS, siRNA, PEI, RVG-PEG-PEI, PEG-PMT, and RVG-PEG-PMT), the fluorescence intensity in the RVG-PEG-PMT/cy5.5-siRNA group was the highest (1.8-fold higher than those of PEI and RVG-PEG-PEI/cy5.5-siRNA groups; 5.8-fold higher than that in the PEG-PMT/cy5.5-siRNA group). Furthermore, RVG-PEG-PMT nanoparticles effectively reduced BACE1 expression in the hippocampus and cortex in the Alzheimer’s disease mouse model by 3.03-fold and 2.32-fold, respectively [76]. Together these studies demonstrate that PMT is an ideal gene delivery carrier due to both the hyperosmotic property of the numerous hydroxyl groups and the proton sponge effect of PEI. In addition, these data showed that RVG-PEG-PMT could deliver genetic cargoes to the brain by crossing the BBB, which has been one of the main obstacles in gene therapy. Based on the gene transport mechanism of RVG-PEG-PMT, further studies should be conducted to investigate and improve methods of gene regulation by delivering siRNA not only to the brain but also to other organs."
8,Sorbitol-based nanoparticles for lung cancer therapy,"3.4 Sorbitol-based nanoparticles for lung cancer therapy Sorbitol (also known as d-glucitol) is generally extracted from Rosaceae family plants such as apples and pears [77]. Even though sorbitol is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, it has been widely used in food industry as a natural ingredient because of its heat-absorbing ability with a sense of softness, sweetness, and pleasure in the mouth [78–80]. Sorbitol is also widely used in other industries such as an intermediate agent for manufacturing artificially synthesized vitamin C by converting d-sorbitol to l-sorbose with Gluconobacter oxydans [81]. To improve the properties of sorbitol as an nanoparticle, In 2011, Islam et al. synthesized and evaluated polysorbitol-mediated transporter (PSMT) based on polysorbitol diacrylate conjugated with low molecular weight PEI (1.2 kDa) (Fig. 7 ). After purification of PSMT, the authors checked whether PSMT/DNA complexes showed enhanced gene expression in different cell lines (H322, A549, and HeLa cells) compared with the positive controls (PEI 25K). Similar with other polyol-based nanoparticles, PSMT did not exhibit any serum effects up to 20 percent of serum existence [82]. The authors’ next study investigated the influence of polysorbitol and PEI on the cellular uptake mechanism for rapid and selective internalization. Four inhibitors (chlorpromazine, β-methyl cyclodextrin, genistein, and wortmannin) were examined, and cells treated with β-methyl cyclodextrin and genistein showed decreased transfection efficacy when increased its amounts of inhibitors [83]. While β-methyl cyclodextrin showed perturbed internalization via inducing cholesterol depletion from cell membranes, which has an effect on inhibiting endosomal escape and nuclear targeting [84], genistein is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that interferes with dynamin II recruitment by disrupting the actin network at the site of endocytosis membrane [85]. Both β-methyl cyclodextrin and genistein are inhibitors of caveolae pathways. Therefore, this study revealed that PSMT enters the cell through caveolae-mediated endocytosis [83]. Shortly after Islam and coworkers reported that PSMT function via the caveolae-mediated cellular uptake pathways [82,83], Islam et al hypothesize that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) might be involved in the acceleration of PSOAT-based cellular internalization. Post-transfection of PSMT/siRNA, they found that the expression level of both caveolin (Cav)-1 and COX-2 were increased at 30 min, however, at 60 min the expression level of COX-2 was dramatically decreased. These results demonstrated that PSMT induced hyperosmotic stress, resulting in stimulating caveolae endocytosis with increasing expression of Cav-1 and COX-2 at the initial stage of transfection, however, later on interaction of Cav-1 with COX-2 might induce the downregulation of COX-2. The possibility of binding Cav-1 and COX-2 was confirmed by investigating the colocalization study (β-methyl cyclodextrin and PSMT/siRNA). The results indicated that in the presence of inhibitor yielded increased amounts of COX-2, however, decreased amounts of COX-2 in the absence of inhibitor, suggesting Cav-1 might interact with COX-2. Taken together, those results suggested that selective cellular uptake routes (caveolae-mediated endocytosis) of the polyplexes was regulated coincidently with the expression of Cav-1 and COX-2 [86]. To further explore the potential of PSMT vectors, Nguyen et al. used these nanoparticles to deliver the p53 tumor suppressor gene to cancer cells. p53 expression and its therapeutic efficacy in inducing apoptosis were assessed by western blotting and confocal microscopy; p53/PSMT led to morphological changes and propidium iodide (PI) accumulation in the nucleus of apoptotic cancer cells. In contrast, HeLa cells treated with a control (free p53-mCherry plasmid DNA complexes) did not display any noticeable expression of p53 protein [87]. These results demonstrate the broad applicability of PSMT as a non-viral carrier. These promising results led Cho et al. to design PSMT as a carrier for local delivery of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) siRNA in a cutaneous wound healing mouse model. The authors hypothesized that the delivery of negatively charged CTGF siRNA with PSMT particles would facilitate the intracellular release of siRNA, thereby reducing contracted scar in the healed skin of the mouse model. Mice injected with CTGF siRNA containing PSMT under the cut wound showed reduced scar formation with presence of papillary structures. Although the precise role and mechanism of CTGF in collagen remodeling was not studied, Cho and his coworkers demonstrated that the CTGF siRNA-treated group, regardless of its carrier, contained papillary structures between the epidermis and the dermis. These results confirmed the safe siRNA delivery by PSMT with brief insights into the role of CTGF in the cutaneous wound healing model [88]. Folic acid is a small targeting molecule that plays an important role in the biosynthesis of amino acids and is actively recognized by various tumors, particularly ovarian, endometrial, renal, and lung cancers, due to the overexpression of folate receptors on the surface of cancer cells [89–92]. Previously, Islam et al. have reported that administration of PSMT with p62 siRNA activated autophagy, resulting in suppressing angiogenesis and cancer cell proliferation in the lungs of K-rasLA1 mice. However, it did not show that how effectively and selectively does PSMT target lung cancer [93]. Therefore, to enhance specificity of PSMT for lung cancer cell targeting, Cho et al. conjugated a folic acid moiety to PSMT to induce folate receptor-mediated endocytosis. Moreover, to investigate whether apoptosis of mitochondria plays a precise pathogenic role in lung cancers, the authors also delivered mitochondrial dynamin-like GTPase siRNA (siOPA1) using folic acid-PSMT (FPS). Using a therapeutic siRNA against OPA1 mRNA, the authors were able to achieve 60% knockdown of OPA1 in the A549 cell line compared with 20% knockdown for both PSMT and PEI 25k/siOPA1. Furthermore, compared with the FPS/siSCR and siOPA1 groups, only the FPS/siOPA1 group had elevated levels of apoptotic (approximately 50% apoptotic, 30% necrotic, and 20% apoptotic or necrotic cells). Based on the in vitro results of gene delivery by FPS nanoparticles, aerosol delivery of siOPA1 to target lung cancer cells in K-rasLA1 mice was also performed. After inhalation of FPS/siOPA, K-rasLA1 mice showed suppression of lung tumor formation and downregulation of OPA1. Furthermore, compared with the control group (FPS/siSCR), which showed severe thickening of the alveolar septa with invasive growth and loss of normal lung structure, the FPS/siOPA1 group showed only small tumorigenic regions [105]. These results confirm that the FPS vector system offers great potential for use in therapeutic gene delivery for antitumor treatment."
9,Other sugar alcohol gene delivery systems,"3.5 Other sugar alcohol gene delivery systems Erythritol ((2R,3S)-butan-1,2,3,4-tetrol) is a naturally occurring sugar alcohol used as a sugar alternative that shows antioxidant activity and inhibits growth and reduces adhesion of bacteria in dental plaques [94,95]. Erythritol has the smallest molecular weight among the sugar alcohols and exhibits different physiochemical properties from other sugar alcohols because it only consists of four carbon atoms. Unlike other polyols, erythritol exhibits unique properties including its insecticidal effects on fruit fly and spotted wing Drosophila and thus may function as an organic insecticide [96–98]. The acrylation of hydroxyl groups can be achieved by reacting the hydroxyl functional groups with acryloyl chloride in the presence of pyridine as base catalysts. Lee et al. used arylation of hydroxyl groups to a erythritol backbone with acryloyl chloride and pyridine, precipitated the reactants with diethyl ether, and subsequently coupled a low molecular weight PEI through amide bond formation (Fig. 8 ). After purification, erythritol derivative polymers with DNA showed enhanced gene expression in various cancer cell lines. Even though it has disadvantages, erythritol may serve as a unique sugar alcohol for use in the biotechnology industry [106]. Xylitol is a naturally occurring pentahydroxy sugar alcohol that is generally extracted from fruits and vegetables, such as plums, cauliflower, and pumpkin [99]. Xylitol has been widely used in the treatment of dental caries due to its reduction of the levels of Mutans streptococci in plaque and saliva, stimulation of the salivary flow, and increase in pH [100–102]. Xylitol also has pharmaceutical applications for its prevention of acute otitis media properties by reducing the adhesion of microorganisms (Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza) to nasopharyngeal cells [103]. However, the leading application of xylitol is in the food industry as a gradient for chewing gum. To improve xylitol as a genetic vector, a xylitol-based nanoparticle (PdXYP) was synthesized using a similar protocol as the previously mentioned study [61], through Michael addition with a low molecular PEI. Many effective cationic nanoparticles are unable to target brain cells, therefore these compounds are modified with peptide, antibodies, or other molecules to penetrate the BBB. Dixylitol containing an eight hydroxyl-polyol backbone of PdXYP can cross the BBB without aid from other molecules and without affecting the TEER. Garg and his coworkers used an in vitro BBB model to evaluate the BBB transmigration ability of PdXYP/DNA; after 3 h incubation, 73% of fluorescent recovery was observed on the brain side of the BBB in the lower chamber. These results supporting the authors’ hypothesis that hyperosmotic properties of PdXYP play a key role in improving the transmigration efficiency of DNA across the BBB. Moreover, to evaluate whether PdXYP/DNA nanocomplexes induce loosening of BBB compactness, TEER values were monitored. Compared with PEI/DNA complexes, PdXYP/DNA resulted in decreased TEER values without any damage to the integrity of the BBB. These results demonstrated that PdXYP can loosen the tight junction of the BBB via hyperosmotic properties without any cytotoxicity. Transfection of astrocytes (existed in the lower side of the BBB in vitro chamber) after treating PdXYP/DNA in the upper side showed BBB transmigration of polyplexes with 18.5% transfection in brain astrocytes, indicating that the transfection efficacy of PdXYP was retained even after penetrating the BBB. This delivery vehicle was later used for in vivo studies (bioimaging assay) of intravenous injection of luciferase gene to the brain, which resulted in luciferase expression in brain [104]."
10,Conclusion,"Previously, we reported the development of different types of sugar alcohol-based nanoparticles and proposed their therapeutic potential. Over the past decade, we have continued to develop technologies to synthesize more stable carriers with effective disease targeting and improving in vivo properties to develop the next-generation nanoparticle translation into the clinics. As described herein, sugar-alcohols allow biocompatible transfection of genetic materials into different types of cell lines enables chemical modification with high efficiency and reduced cytotoxicity of nanoparticle. Indeed, PEI modifications of sugar alcohol based carriers shows improved gene delivery properties, such as targeting ability with reduced cytotoxicity, high transfection efficiency with extending the spectrum of biological applications. However, major hurdles remains a challenge in order to make significant strides in the successful and efficacious use of the sugar alcohol-based nanoparticles delivery system in clinics. To develop unique nanoparticle systems for clinical trials, significant efforts need to be focused on the development of smart nanoparticle systems with control release of the therapeutic agents and introducing active targeting mechanisms for diseased tissues. Although many of these sugar alcohol based platforms are being studied in vitro and in vivo, future studies in this area will continue to improve them being used towards clinical investigations. In this review, we have not only reported the development of commonly used sugar alcohol based carriers in various industries, but we also discussed their applications as a new strategy for gene therapy. The multifunctional sugar alcohol based delivery system holds a great promise in nanomedicine. Sugar alcohol based nanocarriers are versatile candidates for controlled and targeted delivery of nucleic acids, drugs and proteins. Nanogels have gained wide attention by various researchers owing to its high stability, sufficient solubility, ease of production, biocompatibility with different drug molecules and ease of administration. Moreover, sugar alcohol based carriers’ exhibit excellent physicochemical properties like biocompatibility, stability, non-toxicity, and biodegradability as well as best encapsulation efficiency. Various evidences shows the examples of sugar alcohol‐based gene delivery systems encapsulated with therapeutic/diagnostic agents for cancer therapy. Additionally, preclinical and clinical studies reveals the possibility of using sugar alcohol based gene/drug delivery system to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of nucleic acids and biopharmaceutics."
