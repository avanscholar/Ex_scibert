0,Introduction,"Agricultural and food wastes, as well as carbohydrate-rich industrial wastewaters are promising substrates for biological hydrogen production [1,2]. Acidogenic bacteria can ferment the carbohydrates in these feedstocks to hydrogen, carbon dioxide and volatile organic acids – mainly acetic and butyric acids. However, these bacteria are not able to further break down the organic acids to hydrogen due to the positive Gibbs free energy of the reaction. Liu et al. [3] reported the production of hydrogen from acetate at the cathode of a microbial fuel cell. The biochemical barrier was overcome by increasing the electrochemical potential achieved by bacteria in the microbial fuel cell applying an additional voltage of at least 250mV. Another report on hydrogen production from organic acids is from a mixture of acetic and lactic acids [4]. The Clostridium diolis used in that study was not able to produce hydrogen when acetic, citric, propionic and succinic acids were the only available organic substrates. However, when a mixture of acetic and lactic acids was used hydrogen and butyric acid were produced. In dark fermentative hydrogen production, the presence of lactic acid as a metabolite during hydrogen production is frequently regarded as a sign of lower hydrogen production [5–7]. Lactic acid has been rarely studied as substrate for hydrogen production and despite reports of methane production from lactate [8], no significant hydrogen production was reported when lactate was used as the sole substrate [4,9]. Hydrogen yield with a mixed culture using lactate as substrate was reported to be only 2.2mL H2/g lactate (COD basis) with a substrate conversion efficiency of 0.5% [9]. The effect of the addition of lactic acid to a carbohydrate-containing medium for hydrogen production has not been investigated yet. Our study on the effect of addition of some metabolites, including acetic acid, butyric acid, lactic acid and ethanol, to a hydrogen-producing system showed that extrinsic lactic acid could enhance the hydrogen production. This paper is the first report of the enhancement in hydrogen production by addition of lactic acid to a carbohydrate-containing medium."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Inoculum and treatment condition,"2.1 Inoculum and treatment condition Municipal waste activated sludge from the Adelaide Pollution Control Plant in London, Ontario was used as the inoculum for hydrogen production. Prior to inoculation, the sludge was dewatered and then sieved through 2mm screen. In order to enrich hydrogen-producing bacteria, the inoculum was heat treated at 70°C for 30min."
3,Batch experiments,"2.2 Batch experiments All hydrogen production experiments were conducted in 320mL batch vials. The nutrient medium was prepared using 5g/L starch as a carbon source, plus the following inorganic salts (in mg/L): NH4Cl, 2600; K2HPO4, 250; MgCl2·6H2O, 125; FeSO4·7H2O, 5.0; CoCl2·6H2O, 2.5; MnCl2·4H2O, 2.5; KI, 2.5; Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.5; H3BO4, 0.5; NiCl2·6H2O, 0.5; ZnCl2, 0.5. The solution was buffered with 0.07M sodium phosphate and the initial pH was adjusted to 7 using 2M NaOH or 2M HCl. After the addition of the inoculum each vial was purged with nitrogen for 1min. The cultures were placed in a shaker–incubator at 35°C and 180rpm. The experiments for this study were performed under two categories: 2.2.1 Fractional factorial experiments These experiments included 15 batches to study the effect of addition of ethanol, lactic acid, butyric acid and acetic acid on hydrogen production. The concentration of different metabolites in each batch is presented in Section 2.4. The working volume was 120mL and the inoculum concentration was 1.3g VSS/L. 2.2.2 Lactic acid experiments The experiments were conducted to study the effect of addition of lactic acid on hydrogen production. The concentration of lactic acid was 10mM. The experiments were conducted at working volume of 140mL with 0.8g VSS/L inoculum."
4,Analytical procedures,"2.3 Analytical procedures The total gas volume was measured by releasing the gas pressure in the vials using appropriately sized glass syringes (Perfektum; Popper & Sons Inc., NY, USA) in the 5–50mL range to equilibrate with the ambient pressure as recommended by Owen et al. [10]. Gas volumes were corrected to standard conditions (25°C and 1atm). Biogas composition was determined by a gas chromatograph (Model 310, SRI Instruments, Torrance, CA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a molecular sieve column (Molesieve 5A, mesh 80/100, 6ft×1/8in). The temperatures of the column and the TCD detector were 90 and 105°C, respectively. Argon was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 30mL/min. The concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Varian 8500) with a flame ionization detector (FID) equipped with a fused silica column (30m×0.32mm). Helium was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 5mL/min. The temperatures of the column and detector were 110 and 250°C, respectively. Lactic acid concentrations were measured using a high-performance liquid chromatography system (1200 series, Agilent Technologies) equipped with Aminex HPX-87H ion exclusion column (300mm×7.8mm I.D.; BIO-RAD), and a UV-detector at 210nm. The column temperature was adjusted to 30°C. The same instrument with a refractive index detector (RID) was used to measure the concentrations of alcohols. The temperature of the RID was set to 35°C. The concentrations of volatile suspended solids (VSS) were measured according to standard methods [11]. The cumulative hydrogen production profiles were fitted with the modified Gompertz equation [12]: (1) H = P exp { − exp [ R m e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where H is the cumulative hydrogen production (mL), P is the maximum hydrogen production (mL), R m is the maximum hydrogen production rate (mL/h), λ is the lag phase time (h) and t is the incubation time (h). The cumulative hydrogen data were fitted with Gompertz equation using the CurveExpert software (Curve Expert 1.34, Hyams D.G., Starkville, MS, USA)."
5,Fractional factorial design,"2.4 Fractional factorial design A two-level irregular fractional factorial design (12 runs), augmented by three center-point runs, was implemented to explore the effect of addition of ethanol (x 1) at concentration of 5mM and lactic acid (x 2), butyric acid (x 3) and acetic acid (x 4) at concentrations of 10mM on the maximum hydrogen production and the hydrogen production rate. The maximum concentrations were chosen based on the average concentrations of these metabolites produced in our previous experiments. Table 1 summarizes the test levels of the experimental variables. The detailed experimental design with the coded values of the four variables is given in Table 2 . The design array was set to determine the main effect of each factor and two factor interactions. The analysis of the variance was performed using the Design-Expert software (Version 7.0.0, Stat-Ease, Minneapolis, USA)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Fractional factorial experiments,"3.1 Fractional factorial experiments According to the design matrix (Table 2), fifteen batch experiments including three center points, were conducted. The cumulative hydrogen profiles in these experiments are shown in Fig. 1 . It was observed that all the runs containing 10mM lactic acid (level +1: runs 2, 5, 6, 9, 10 and 12) produced the highest amounts of hydrogen. The center-point runs (13, 14 and 15), which contained 5mM (level 0) lactic acid, produced slightly lower amounts of hydrogen. The lowest amounts of hydrogen, however, were evolved when no lactic acid was added to the culture (runs 1, 3, 4, 7, 8 and 11). The statistical analysis confirmed the large positive effect of lactic acid on hydrogen production. The maximum hydrogen production (P) and maximum hydrogen production rate (R m) were estimated by the Gompertz equation, Eq. (1), and used for the statistical analysis. The estimated equation for the maximum hydrogen production was obtained by multivariable regression in terms of the coded values as follows. (2) P H 2 = 93.23 + 7.81 x 1 + 20.19 x 2 + 0.93 x 3 − 3.72 x 4 + 6.63 x 2 x 3 + 6.74 x 2 x 4 where P H 2 is the predicted maximum hydrogen production (mL) and x 1–x 4 are the coded values of ethanol, lactic acid, butyric acid and acetic acid concentrations as demonstrated in Table 1, which range from −1 to 1. The R-squared value of the model (0.9054) also shows that about 90% of the variability of P H 2 is explained by x 1 to x 4, x 2×x 3 and x 2×x 4. The analysis of the variance (ANOVA) is shown in Table 3 . The calculated Fisher's F value (11.17) and a probability (P) value of 0.0028 in ANOVA demonstrate that the regression model was significant. Generally, if the P value is lower than 0.05, it indicates that the term is statistically significant [13]. It was observed from the ANOVA table that lactic acid (P =0.0001) was the most significant term of the model. Ethanol (P =0.0477) also showed a significant effect on hydrogen production. However, it is probably better to accept higher P values (<0.1) to avoid the chance of missing an important factor [14]. Based on this concept, interactions of lactic acid–butyric acid (x 2×x 3) and lactic acid–acetic acid (x 2×x 4) having P values of 0.0811 and 0.0755, respectively, were also considered as marginally significant terms in the model. These interactions indicated that at higher concentrations of butyric and acetic acids the positive effect of lactic acid on hydrogen production increased. The butyric acid (x 3) and acetic acid (x 4) with P values of 0.7562 and 0.2275 were insignificant factors; however, they were included in the model to satisfy the hierarchy. The curvature F value of 0.26 implies that the curvature, as measured by the difference between the average of the center points and the average of the factorial points, in the design space was not significant. Therefore, the behavior can be represented by a linear change in the response between the high and low levels of experimental variables. The same statistical analysis was also applied for the maximum hydrogen production rate as the response. The results illustrated that only lactic acid had a significant positive effect on the maximum hydrogen production rate (P =0.000) and the effects of the other compounds were insignificant."
8,Lactic acid experiments,"3.2 Lactic acid experiments The results of the fractional factorial design confirmed that addition of lactic acid to the media could enhance both maximum hydrogen production and hydrogen production rate. In order to further study this enhancement, the cumulative hydrogen production from starch in the presence of lactic acid (10mM) was investigated and compared with the cases in which only starch or lactic acid was present in the culture (Fig. 2 ). It was observed that the presence of lactic acid in a starch-containing media increased the hydrogen production from 89.5 to 119.9mL/g COD starch. However, when lactic acid was the sole carbon source, only 2.9mL (3.0mL/g COD lactic acid) hydrogen was produced, similar to the previous observation of 2.3mL/g COD lactate in the literature [9]. The kinetic parameters estimated by the modified Gompertz Eq. (1) are presented in Table 4 . The lag time (λ) in the medium containing both lactic acid and starch was slightly lower than the one with only starch. When 10mM lactic acid was added to the starch medium the maximum hydrogen production rate (R m) and the maximum hydrogen production (P) increased from 4.3mL/h to 8.2mL/h and from 93.0mL to 144.1mL, respectively. The hydrogen production yield also increased by 59% from 5.70 to 9.08mmol H2/g starch. Moreover, even after considering the additional carbon available for fermentation from the lactic acid, hydrogen yield increased by 35% from 14.25 to 19.25mmol H2/g carbon. For the experiments shown in Fig. 2, the concentrations of soluble metabolites were measured at various time intervals during the course of hydrogen production (Fig. 3 ). Formation of the metabolites from starch showed different patterns in the presence and absence of lactic acid. In the absence of lactic acid (Fig. 3A), acetate, butyrate and ethanol were produced at the same level. Lactic acid was also produced but it was completely consumed later. In media containing both lactic acid and starch (Fig. 3B), lactic acid decomposition started after 12h. Butyric acid exhibited the highest rate of formation and it was the most predominant soluble metabolite. Acetic acid was the second major metabolite. Ethanol was formed in lower concentration compared to starch medium. The other difference was the formation of small amounts of propionic acid which was decomposed at the end of the fermentation. In the starch medium, propionic acid was not detected. When lactic acid was the sole carbon source (Fig. 3C), propionate type fermentation was observed. The formation of propionic and acetic acids as the main fermentation products together with some valeric acid coupled with insignificant gas production are characteristic of propionate type fermentation [15]. All the aforementioned characteristics were observed in the culture that contained only lactic acid as carbon source (Figs. 2 and 3C). Clostridium propionicum is one of the species that has the ability to consume lactic acid through the following reaction [16]: (3) 3 CH3CH(OH)COOH→2 CH3CH2COOH+CH3COOH+CO2 Eq. (3) indicates that from the consumption of 3mol of lactic acid, 2mol propionic acid and 1mol acetic acid can be produced. As apparent from Table 5 , in the medium containing only lactic acid, from 8.9mM lactic acid, 5.13mM propionic acid and 2.94mM acetic acid were produced which are respectively 86.5% and 99.1% of the theoretical values calculated from Eq. (3). It is noteworthy that the lactic acid present in starch-containing medium showed completely different metabolic pathway and gave rise to the hydrogen production together with the formation of butyric acid as the major metabolite. If NADH pathway is the pathway for hydrogen evolution, hydrogen will be evolved through the re-oxidation of NADH [17]: (4) NADH+H+ →H2 +NAD+ With increasing excess NADH, the hydrogen yield will be improved. Through the main pathway of glycolysis glucose is decomposed to pyruvate. Pyruvate is then used for formation of organic acids and alcohols. The overall reaction equations [18,19] for the products which were detected in our experiments are presented in Table 6 . The valerate and iso-butyrate were not considered in the calculation of excess NADH, since they are produced by Clostridial species from fermentation of amino acids not carbohydrates [16]. Excess NADH for each condition can be calculated from the difference between produced and used NADH. Assuming that the amount of produced pyruvate is equal to that of used pyruvate [18] the excess NADH can be calculated from the molar concentrations of soluble metabolites as follows: (5) [ Generated NADH ] = [ produced pyruvate ] + [ acetate ] = [ used pyruvate ] + [ acetate ] = { [ acetate ] + 2 [ butyrate ] + [ propionate ] + [ lactate ] + [ ethanol ] } + [ acetate ] (6) [ Used NADH ] = [ lactate ] + 2 [ propionate ] + [ formate ] + [ ethanol ] (7) [ Excess NADH ] = [ generated NADH ] − [ used NADH ] = 2 [ acetate ] + 2 [ butyrate ] − [ propionate ] − [ formate ] Based on Eq. (7) the excess NADH concentrations were calculated from the molar concentrations of soluble metabolites after 48h incubation (Table 5). The results show that the addition of 10mM lactic acid increased the residual NADH from 37.05mM to 50.75mM. It is noteworthy that the aforementioned 37% increase in residual NADH compares well with the 35% increase in hydrogen yield, on unit carbon mass basis. The effect of the addition of different concentrations of lactic acid to a medium containing 5g/L starch was investigated in batch tests. As illustrated in Fig. 4A, the cumulative hydrogen production increased with increasing the concentration of lactic acid and remained constant at concentrations above 3g/L. The addition of lactic acid even at concentration of 5g/L did not cause inhibition to the hydrogen production. If both starch and lactic acid were considered as carbon sources, the highest hydrogen production was 16.9mL hydrogen/g COD removed with the addition of 1g/L lactic acid to the starch culture. When lactic acid concentration was between 0.25 and 2g/L, it was totally depleted by the end of fermentation. However, total consumption did not occur when lactic acid was added at the concentrations of 3–5g/L (33–55mM)."
9,Conclusions,The results of this work demonstrated that the addition of lactic acid (up to 3g/L) to a starch-containing medium could improve hydrogen production. The analysis of soluble metabolites showed that the metabolism of starch was affected by the addition of lactic acid. The increase in hydrogen production in the presence of lactic acid was accompanied by formation of higher amounts of butyric acid as the predominant aqueous metabolite. The increase in hydrogen production yield was assigned to the increase in the available residual NADH for hydrogen production. We are currently working on finding the mechanism of the enhancement of hydrogen production by extrinsic lactic acid.
