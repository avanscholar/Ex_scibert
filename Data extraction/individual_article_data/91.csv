0,Introduction,"Furfural, obtained via acid-catalyzed dehydration of pentose such as xylose and arabinose or via fast pyrolysis of biomass, is one of the most promising biomass-derived platforms as a building block in the bio-refinery approach [1,2]. Selective hydrogenation of furfural has gained much attention for the production of furfuryl alcohol (FA), an important intermediate for the manufacturing of lysine, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), plasticizers, dispersing agent, and lubricants and is mainly used in the manufacture of resins, synthetic fibers, and agrochemicals [3]. In furan industrial process, copper chromite has traditionally been used as the catalyst for hydrogenation of furfural to FA [2,3]. However, concern of the environmental toxic impact due to the chromium presence in the catalysts led to the development of chromium free catalysts. Platinum-based catalysts are known as highly efficient catalysts used in the hydrogenation of furfural to FA because of their ability to hydrogenate the CO under mild conditions [3–5]. Pt nanoparticles in the range of 3–7 nm were found to favor the hydrogenation of furfural to FA whereas Pt particle size less than 3 nm promoted the decarbonylation of furfural to furan [3,6]. However, modification of Pt catalysts by alloying [7,8], adding promoters [7,9], and by using strong metal-support interaction to induce electronic effects [8,10] show significant impact on both activity and selectivity towards FA of the catalysts in furfural hydrogenation. For examples, The metal-support interaction on Pt/TiO2 induced hydrogen spillover, leading to the formation of furfuryl-oxy intermediate on the titania support [11,12]. Synergetic effect between Pt and Co on carbon obtained by co-impregnation was reported to be beneficial in furfural hydrogenation and product selectivity can be adjusted depending on the weight ratio of Pt and Co [13,14]. In this study, monometallic Pt/TiO2 and bimetallic Pt-Co/TiO2 were prepared by flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) and studied in the liquid-phase selective hydrogenation of furfural to FA under mild conditions. The characteristics of Pt-Co/TiO2 formed by one-step FSP were quite different from those obtained by co-impregnation as illustrated by various characterization techniques such as CO pulse chemisorption, H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), transmission electron spectroscopy (TEM), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of adsorbed CO. A structural-activity relationship of these FSP-PtCo/TiO2 catalysts was proposed."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The Pt/TiO2 (0.7 wt% Pt) and Pt-Co/TiO2 (0.7 wt% Pt and 0–0.4 wt% Co) catalysts were prepared by FSP method according to the procedure described in Ref. [15] using platinum (II) acetylacetonate (Pt(C5H7O2)2, 99.99%, Aldrich), cobalt naphthenate (CoC22H14O4, 6 wt% in mineral spirits, Aldrich), and titanium (IV) butoxide (Ti(OCH2CH2CH2CH3)4, 97%, Aldrich) as Pt, Co, and TiO2 precursors, respectively. The catalysts prepared by FSP are denoted as (F) Pt/TiO2 and (F) Pt-Co/TiO2, respectively. The TiO2 supported Pt and PtCo catalysts were also prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using platinum (II) acetylacetonate (Pt(C5H7O2)2, 99.99%, Aldrich), cobalt naphthenate (CoC22H14O4, 6 wt% in mineral spirits, Aldrich) as Pt and Co precursors and P-25 TiO2 as the support. The catalysts were dried in an oven at 100 °C overnight, and calcined in air at 500 °C for 2 h. The impregnated catalysts are denoted as (I) Pt/TiO2 and (I) Pt-Co/TiO2, respectively."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The XRD patterns were recorded using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Ni-filter CuKα radiation. The actual amount of Pt and Co loadings in the samples were analyzed by AAS. The N2 physisorption was conducted by using a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 instrument with the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The TEM observations were performed with a JEOL JEM 2010 transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV and equipped with LaB6 thermoionic electron-gun, an UHR pole piece (point resolution 0.196 nm) and a Pentafet Link-INCA EDX spectrometer (Oxford Instruments). The percentages of Pt dispersion were measured by CO pulse chemisorption using a Micromeritics ChemiSorb 2750 equipped with ChemiSoft TPx software. Prior to chemisorption, the catalyst was reduced with hydrogen (25 cm3/min) at 500 °C for 2 h and then cooled down to the room temperature under helium flow (25 cm3/min). The H2-TPR was carried out on a Micromeritics ChemiSorb 2750 with ChemiSoft TPx software. The sample was pretreated at 150 °C under N2 flow (25 cm3/min) for 1 h. The FT-IR spectra of adsorbed CO were collected using FTIR-620 spectrometer (JASCO) with a MCT detector at a wavenumber resolution of 2 cm−1. The sample was heated to 300 °C and reduced by H2 for 30 min."
4,Catalytic reaction study,"2.3 Catalytic reaction study Prior to the reaction test, the catalyst was reduced with hydrogen (25 cm3/min) at 500 °C for 2 h. Approximately 0.05 g of catalyst was dispersed into the reactant mixture of 50 μL furfural (99%, Aldrich) and 10.0 mL methanol (98%, Aldrich) in 100 cm3 stainless steel autoclave reactor (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan). The selective hydrogenation reaction was carried out at temperature of 50 °C and H2 pressure of 2 MPa for 2 h. After that, the liquid product was collected and analyzed by a gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and Rtx-5 capillary column."
5,Results and discussion,"Based on the XRD patterns of the Pt/TiO2 and Pt-Co/TiO2 catalysts (Fig. 1 ), the crystalline phases of TiO2 consisting of anatase phase at 2θ = 25° (major), 37°, 48°, 55°, 56°, 62°, 71°, and 75° and rutile phase at 2θ = 28° (major), 36°, 42°, and 57° [16] were observed. The characteristic peaks for Pt metal/Pt oxides and Co metal/Co oxides could not be detected due probably to the low amount of metal (Pt and Co) loading and/or high dispersion of these metals on the TiO2 support. As shown in Table 1 , the TiO2 anatase phase composition of (I) Pt/TiO2 (85.8%) was slightly lower than that of (F) PT/TiO2 (89.6%). Adding Co by different methods led to different effects on the TiO2 phase composition. When Co was co-impregnated with 0.7 wt% Pt on the TiO2 support, the anatase phase composition increased from 85.8 to 90.5% with increasing Co loading from 0.04 to 0.2 wt%. Because the ionic radius of Co2+ (0.075 nm) is not much different from Ti4+ (0.061 nm), it has been postulated that Co2+ ions could enter into TiO2 anatase structure and inhibit the phase transformation from anatase to rutile [17]. Upon substitutional dopants, the level of oxygen vacancies decreased, inhibiting the rutile phase transformation [18,19]. On the contrary, the TiO2 anatase phase composition of the FSP-derived bimetallic PtCo catalysts was significantly decreased to ~70% comparing to the monometallic (F) PT/TiO2. The ionic substitution of Ti4+ with metal cationic ions could occur during the particle formation step during FSP. The replacement of Ti4+ with metal cationic ions having lower valences such as Co2+ would generate more oxygen vacancies, promoting phase transformation from anatase to rutile along the flame. Simultaneous formation of TiO2 support and Co metal by using polymeric precursor [20] or by sol-gel technique [21] also showed similar effect of TiO2 phase transformation as in the FSP method. The average crystallite size of anatase phase TiO2 for the (F) PT/TiO2 remained unaltered at 12 nm upon Co loading by FSP method whereas those obtained by co-impregnation led to a slight increase of anatase phase TiO2 crystallite size from 12 to 16 nm. The BET surface areas of the Pt-based catalysts prepared by impregnation were in the range of 52–60 m2/g, and were slightly larger than those prepared by FSP (43–50 m2/g). Regardless of the preparation method used, Co addition as a second metal led to the increment of the BET surface area. For a similar amount of metal loading, Pt dispersion of the Pt-based catalysts prepared by impregnation was higher than that prepared by FSP. During FSP synthesis, suppression of CO chemisorption on surface Pt sites may be due to partial coverage of metal surface by the support matrix [22,23]. However, addition of Co as a second metal resulted in higher Pt dispersion regardless of the preparation method used. The interaction between Pt and Co was reported to compensate the electron deficiency of Pt sites by d-electron rehybridization, thus enhancing the adsorption ability of CO [24]. The H2-TPR profiles of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 . All the synthesized Pt-based catalysts showed three major reduction peaks at 94 - 105 °C, 313–380 °C, and 509–687 °C, which were attributed to the reduction of PtOx particles to metallic Pt0 particles, the reduction of Pt species interacting with the TiO2 support in the form of Pt-TiOx interface sites, and the reduction of surface capping oxygen of TiO2 support, respectively [25]. It is obviously seen that the reduction peak of the Pt-TiOx interface sites for the (F) Pt/TiO2 catalyst shifted towards higher temperature and became broader compared to the (I) Pt/TiO2, indicating the stronger metal-support interaction induced by FSP method. For both cases, Co addition as a second metal in the Pt-based catalysts further shifted the reduction temperature of the Pt-TiOx species, due probably to the PtCo interaction and/or the migration of Co particles onto the Pt surface (decoration effect) [26]. Moreover, the reduction of surface capping oxygen of TiO2 drastically shifted from 545 °C for the monometallic (I) Pt/TiO2 to 615–687 °C for the bimetallic (I) Pt-Co/TiO2 while those of the FSP made catalysts remained unchanged at 510 °C. On the other hand, for bimetallic Pt-Co/TiO2, the Pt-TiOx reduction peak of (I) Pt-Co/TiO2 were located at higher temperatures compared to (F) Pt-Co/TiO2, which could be attributed to stronger metal-support interaction upon Co addition on the impregnated catalysts. As a consequence, the (I) Pt-0.2Co/TiO2 showed higher conversion and selectivity of FA compared to (F) Pt-0.2Co/TiO2, which was consistent with the metal-support interaction from H2-TPR. Nevertheless, it can be suggested that Co addition on FSP-made catalyst was not necessary for improvement of the interaction between metals and support in order to enhance the selectivity to FA. As observed from the TEM images (Fig. 3 ), the monometallic (I) Pt/TiO2 catalyst was significantly composed of very small and narrowly distributed nanoparticles (≤ 2 nm). Very rarely large (10–100 nm) Pt particles could be observed. (F) Pt/TiO2 catalyst showed three types of nanoparticle sizes. First, a collection of very small nanoparticle (≤ 2 nm) similar to the one found on (I) Pt/TiO2, then a collection of nanoparticles between 3 and 10 nm, and finally some very large spherical nanoparticles with sizes of several tens to several hundreds nm. It is suggested that (I) Pt/TiO2 essentially showed very small Pt nanoparticle sizes (≤ 2 nm) and the selectivity of FA was significant lower than the (F) Pt/TiO2. The selectivity of FA may depend on the Pt particle size. It has been report that Pt nanoparticles of sizes less than 2 nm supported on the silica are highly selective towards decarbonylation of furfural to main product of furan over vapor phase furfural hydrogenation [6]. Concerning the Co addition as a second metal, (I) Pt-0.2Co/TiO2 was essentially consisted of very small nanoparticles as (I) Pt/TiO2. The average particle size of these nanoparticles slightly increased with the addition of Co (1.7 nm for (I) Pt-0.2Co/TiO2 and 1.3 nm for (I) Pt/TiO2) and the particle size distribution was substantially broader. There are also very rare of larger particles. The (F) Pt-0.2Co/TiO2 catalyst also showed characteristics similar to those of (F) Pt/TiO2. Two types of nanoparticles and some large spherical ones. The smaller nanoparticles also slightly increase in size of 1.9 nm for (F) Pt-0.2Co/TiO2 compared to 1.5 nm for (F) Pt/TiO2. The intermediate nanoparticles were not vary too much in size (6.8 nm for (F) Pt-0.2Co/TiO2 compared to 6.2 nm for (F) Pt/TiO2). The large spherical particles have several hundreds nm. The larger spherical particles that originated by FSP method were much larger than the size of the grains of titania and thus their interaction was poor, resulting to reduce the catalytic activity. The IR spectra of adsorbed CO on the different catalysts reduced at 500 °C are shown in Fig. 4 . The bands at 2188–2185 cm−1 represented to CO formed with Ti4+ cations on the surface [27]. The band at 2086–2078 cm−1 was assigned to CO linearly adsorbed on low - coordination Pt (Pt0-CO) or Co (Co0-CO) atoms on edge sites, while the band at 1850 cm−1 was assigned to CO bridged between two Pt metal atoms (Pt0-CO-Pt0). It has been reported that linear-type adsorbed CO dominated on small Pt particles while bridge-type adsorbed CO formed mainly on larger Pt particles [28,29]. The ratio of Pt on linearly CO adsorbed (Pt0-CO) to bridged CO adsorbed (Pt0-CO-Pt0) atom was high due to the presence of very small Pt particles size (≤ 2 nm), which was consistent with the average particle size observed from TEM and further increase selectivity of FA with the Co addition. The Pt0-CO band center of (F) Pt/TiO2 shifted to lower frequency with lower intensity compared to (I) Pt/TiO2. The lower shift and increase in intensity of the Pt0-CO band were also observed in bimetallic (F) Pt-0.2Co/TiO2 compared to (I) Pt-0.2Co/TiO2."
6,Catalytic reaction study,"3.1 Catalytic reaction study In this study, FA was the only desired product being formed and 2-furaldehyde dimethyl acetal was the solvent product (SP) which can be generated upon furfural acetalization when using methanol as the solvent [3] in the presence of metal catalysts. The catalytic performances of all the Pt-based catalysts in the liquid-phase selective hydrogenation of furfural to FA are summarized in Table 2 . The furfural conversion and selectivity to FA over (I) Pt/TiO2 catalyst were 84.6% and 71.5%, respectively. Modification of (I) Pt/TiO2 by Co addition, furfural conversion and selectivity to FA increased with increasing Co loading up to 0.2 wt% in which furfural was fully converted within 2 h of reaction time and high selectivity to FA up to 97.5% was achieved. Improvement in furfural conversion upon Co addition by co-impregnation was correlated with high Pt dispersion and high TiO2 anatase phase composition. The subsurface oxygen vacancies on the reduced anatase TiO2-supported metal catalysts were found to be favorable adsorption sites for H atoms [30]. On the other hand, the hydrogen would weakly interact with the rutile TiO2-supported ones [31]. In addition, increase in the selectivity to FA could be attributed to the formation of Pt-TiOx interface sites, in which oxygen atom in the CO group of furfural could be coordinated via a lone pair of electrons, promoting the selective activation of carbonyl bonds in furfural [32]. In the perspective of electronic effect, the stronger interaction between Pt and TiO2 support indicated more electron transfer from support to metals, thus leading to the formation of electron-rich metal particles. The electronegativity of metal catalysts has been reported to affect the CO activation in furfural hydrogenation [32]. Stronger electronegativity of metal particles (or electron-rich metals) could activate the CO bond towards the furfural hydrogenation to FA. Similar results have been reported over Cu/TiO2-SiO2, Au/Al2O3, Fe-promoted NiB amorphous alloy catalyst, Au/ZrO2, and Au/TiO2. Furfural conversion of the monometallic (F) Pt/TiO2 was not much different from the (I) Pt/TiO2 catalyst but the selectivity to FA was found to be largely improved. This improvement was attributed to the stronger metal-support interaction upon FSP. However, Co addition upon FSP slightly improved the selectivity to FA but decreased furfural conversion. It is suggested that the presence of higher rutile TiO2 phase diminish the furfural conversion despite its high Pt dispersion based on CO chemisorption ability. Nevertheless, it could be said that Co addition into the Pt-based catalysts upon FSP was unnecessary for modification of the interaction between metals and support in order to enhance the selectivity to FA. Comparing the bimetallic Pt-0.2Co/TiO2 catalysts prepared by impregnation and flame spray pyrolysis, the (I) Pt-0.2Co/TiO2 catalyst showed higher furfural conversion and selectivity to FA than the (F) Pt-0.2Co/TiO2 catalyst because of higher Pt dispersion, TiO2 anatase phase composition, and the strong interaction between metals and support. Among all Pt-based catalysts in this study, the (I) Pt-0.2Co/TiO2 exhibited the highest FA yield at 97.5%. The activity of 1st cycle and 2nd cycle for (F) Pt-0.2Co/TiO2 catalyst were 71.1% and 67.4%, respectively. It can be observed that the activity decreased by 5.2% after 2nd reaction. Table 3 shows a comparison between the Pt-based catalysts in this study and those reported in the literature. It is notable that one of the best results with furfural conversion (100%) and FA selectivity (95.7%) could be obtained over 2 wt% Pt-1 wt% Re/TiO2-ZrO2 [10], however more severe conditions (130 °C, 5 MPa of H2) and long reaction time (8 h) were used in the presence of ethanol as a solvent. The catalysts in the present studies achieved similar conversion/selectivity under milder reaction conditions."
7,Conclusions,"While Co addition via co-impregnation on Pt/TiO2 catalysts improved both furfural conversion and selectivity to FA due to higher TiO2 anatase phase composition, high Pt dispersion, and stronger interaction between metals and support, formation of Pt-Co/TiO2 by one-step FSP resulted in a decreased furfural conversion despite its high Pt dispersion due to the acceleration of rutile phase transformation of the TiO2. However, a largely improvement of FA selectivity on the FSP-made catalysts was attributed to the stronger metal-support interaction upon FSP as revealed by the higher reduction temperature of the Pt-TiOx interface sites. Thus, modification of the Pt/TiO2 by Co addition was unnecessary for catalyst improvement when using the FSP Pt/TiO2 catalysts."
