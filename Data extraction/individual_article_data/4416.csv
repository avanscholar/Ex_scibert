0,Introduction,"Higher alcohol synthesis from syngas has received renewed attention in the last years for its application in the field of biofuel and fuel additive production [1–6]. Syngas can be obtained by gasification of renewable sources such as biomass [7–9] and organic waste [10] as well as from coal gasification [11–14] and reforming of natural gas [15]. Several catalytic systems have been investigated for higher alcohol synthesis, such as alkali promoted Cu/ZnO [16–21], Cu/Co-based catalysts [22–26], Rh-based catalysts [27–29], and alkali/MoS2-based catalysts [30–32]. These catalysts show either too low higher alcohol (C2+OH) selectivity or too low activity except for alkali promoted MoS2-based catalysts, which exhibit reasonably good activity and selectivity to higher alcohols [30,31,33]. However, traces of organic sulfur components also form during the process [33], which is undesirable, especially when the alcohol product is intended for fuel applications. Previous studies have also reported alkali modified bulk molybdenum carbides as potential catalysts for higher alcohol synthesis [34–36]. However, bulk Mo2C suffers from a low specific surface area due to the high carburization temperature (up to 750°C) and high loading of promoters (up to 10wt% K2CO3, molar ratio of K/Mo=0.14) [34,36], which result in relatively low alcohol yields during CO hydrogenation [34,36]. Xiang et al. [37–40] found that the addition of Ni, Co, and Fe can significantly improve the overall activity of alkali promoted bulk Mo2C for CO hydrogenation, however, hydrocarbons are still dominant products (up to 55Cmol%), which is undesired. Here, we present a prospective approach to increase the activity and selectivity of alcohols over molybdenum carbide by supporting the carbide on high surface area supports. The investigations include evaluations of various support materials like active carbon (AC), carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and titanium dioxide, evaluations of the optimal loadings of both Mo2C and the K2CO3 promoter on active carbon, as well as structural characterization by using BET surface area measurements, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD)."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation AC, CNTs, and TiO2 pellets were crushed and sieved to a size range of 0.6–1.4mm. Additionally, CNTs were purified by refluxing 5g in 500ml of 37wt% nitric acid at 110°C for 5h, followed by filtration, washing and drying before impregnation [41]. The precursor solution of Mo7O24(NH4)6·4H2O was added to the individual supports in amounts corresponding to their pore volume (Table S1 in supplementary materials) and aged at room temperature for 1h. The sample was then dried at 100°C in air for 12–14h and calcined at 450°C in N2 flow for 2h with a heating rate of 5°Cmin−1, and subsequently carburized. Precursors used for preparation of all supported Mo2C catalysts are shown in Table S1 in the supplementary materials. In a typical carburization process, the oxide/support precursors (6–8g) were placed in a quartz holder, which was then placed in a quartz tube inside a tube furnace (Carbolite). The system was first purged with N2 and then subjected to a flow of 20vol% CH4/H2 (52Nmlmin−1) with a temperature programmed ramping (below 280°C, ramp 5°Cmin−1, and above 280°C, ramp 0.5°Cmin−1, up to 750°C and kept at 750°C for 2h). Afterwards the sample was cooled down in the flow of 20vol% CH4/H2 until the temperature was below 280°C. Then N2 was used to flush the system until room temperature was reached. Before removing the sample from the furnace, it was exposed to a flow of 1vol% O2/N2 for at least 2h to passivate the sample [42–45]. For alkali-modified carbide samples, an incipient wetness impregnation step was applied using an aqueous solution of K2CO3. The impregnated samples were then aged for 1h, dried in N2 at room temperature for 12–16h and then calcined in flowing N2 at 450°C for 2h with a heating rate of 5°Cmin−1. Table 1 shows the composition of the prepared catalysts with different supports and different loadings of Mo2C and K2CO3 on AC. The catalysts can be divided in three groups: (a) 5wt% of Mo2C on AC, CNT, and TiO2 (all promoted by K2CO3 to yield a molar ratio of K/Mo=0.14); (b) 5, 20, 40wt% of Mo2C on AC (all promoted to K/Mo=0.14, mol/mol); (c) 20wt% Mo2C/AC promoted to K/Mo=0, 0.14, 0.21, 0.28, mol/mol. For the notation, for example AC_5_14K means that the support is active carbon with a loading of 5wt% Mo and promoted by K2CO3 to yield a K/Mo molar ratio of 0.14. The results for bulk carbides are taken from previous work in our lab [36]."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The specific surface area of supports, oxide precursors, carbides, and fresh catalysts were measured by nitrogen adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature using a QuantaChrome Autosorb iQ2 gas sorption analyzer. The samples were outgassed under vacuum at 250°C for 4h. The measurements of the specific surface areas were performed with a 7-point linear BET plot in the range p/p 0 =0.05–0.3. XRD was carried out on a PANalytical X’Pert PRO diffractometer operated at 45kV and 40mA with a 2θ range of 10° to 80° with a scanning rate of 0.00164°/s on passivated samples; the total scan time was 45min. TEM was conducted on a FEI Titan 80–300 aberration corrected microscope operated at 300kV, equipped with an Oxford Instruments INCA-EDX spectrometer for elemental analysis. The catalysts were dispersed in dry form on the TEM grids, which were Cu-grids coated with a holey carbon film."
4,Catalyst testing,"2.3 Catalyst testing The performance of the catalysts for CO hydrogenation has been evaluated in a fixed-bed continuous-flow reactor with a GC–FID/TCD detection system [33,46]. The following species were quantified: C1-C4 alcohols: methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, and iso-butanol; C1–C3 hydrocarbons: methane, ethene, ethane, and propane, as well as dimethyl ether (DME) and ethyl acetate. The gas flow rate was measured by a bubble flow meter. The mass balance for carbon was generally fulfilled to within 5%. Prior to the reaction, all catalysts were treated in situ with a flow of 20vol% H2 in N2 (35Nmlmin−1) at 350°C for 2h with a heating rate of 3°Cmin−1 to remove a possible passivation layer on the catalyst. The conversion of CO (X CO) is calculated from the molar flow rates of CO (F CO) into and out of the reactor: X CO = F CO in − F CO out F CO in × 100 % The CO2-free selectivity to a given product (S i ) is based on the total number of carbon atoms in the products except CO2: S i = ( n i y i ) ∑ n i y i × 100 % where n i n i ≥ 1 is the number of carbon atoms in component i, and y i is the mole fraction of component i in the product stream."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst structure,"3.1 Catalyst structure The alkali promoted bulk Mo2C suffers from a low specific surface area, because of the high carburization temperature (up to 750°C) and high loading of K2CO3 promoter [34,36]. The high carburization temperature also challenges the thermal stability of the support materials. It is therefore important to evaluate the surface areas of supports, oxide precursors, carbides, and fresh catalysts (carbides promoted by K2CO3). The results in Table 2 illustrate that the applied carburization conditions yield a bulk carbide with low surface area (11.5m2 g−1), although the surface area is increased compared to its oxide precursor (3m2 g−1) due to the generation of pores during the carburization process. However, the surface area decreases significantly to 2.4m2 g−1 after loading of K2CO3 (10wt%), which occupies most of the pore structure. A similar tendency – that supported carbides show higher surface areas than their oxide precursors is observed for all samples except the titanium dioxide supported Mo2C. Generally the surface areas of AC supported samples decrease both upon addition of K2CO3 and with increasing Mo2C loadings. The surface area of the titanium dioxide supported MoO3 decreases by a factor of 3.5 after carburization. This may be because titanium dioxide starts to transform from the higher surface area anatase phase to the low surface area rutile phase when the temperature is higher than 550°C [47,48]. We also observe rutile formation in the passivated TiO2_5_14K sample, as shown in the supplementary material (Fig. S1). However, no specific Mo2C reflection is observed, which is probably due to the small particles being formed and dispersed on the surface, which makes them difficult to analyze by XRD. Similar results are found for the other two 5wt% loading of Mo2C samples (on AC and CNT). Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffractograms of bulk and AC supported molybdenum carbide samples. The observed reflections of bulk molybdenum carbide correspond well to Mo2C in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD files 618291 and 43322). There are two possible structures of molybdenum carbide: orthorhombic Mo2C (often denoted as α-Mo2C) and hexagonal Mo2C (often denoted as β-Mo2C) [49,50]. It is very difficult to distinguish between hexagonal and orthorhombic Mo2C by XRD alone [51]. However, Page et al. [52] used a carburization procedure similar to the one used in this study and found that the formed material had the orthorhombic structure according to the results of neutron diffraction. The XRD pattern of the 5wt% Mo2C/AC sample exhibits no specific Mo2C reflections, but for the higher loadings of 20wt% and 40wt% Mo2C on AC, Mo2C reflections are visible. This is probably due to the higher concentration of Mo2C on the support leading to larger particles and higher crystallinity of Mo2C. The 40wt% Mo2C (AC_40_14K) shows much smaller BET surface area compared to those of lower loadings on Mo2C (20wt% and 5wt%) on AC. Additionally, the TEM images of the 5wt% of Mo2C/CNT sample are shown in the supplementary information (Fig. S2). Mo2C particles are located both inside and outside the CNTs and the observed Mo2C particles are about 3–8nm, as shown in Fig S2. The average inner and outer diameters of CNTs are about 4nm and 8nm, respectively (Fig. S3)."
7,Catalyst activity and selectivity,"3.2 Catalyst activity and selectivity 3.2.1 Time on stream catalytic behavior Fig. 2 shows a typical activity vs. time on stream profile of a supported carbide catalysts, exemplified with the AC_20_21K catalyst. The activity is stable at 250°C and 275°C, while a slight decline in activity over time can be observed at 300°C. The decline in activity could be due to carbon formation, which is a typical deactivation process for bulk Mo2C and therefore most likely also for supported carbides [34,36,53]. Fig. 2 illustrates that the selectivity to methanol and higher alcohols gradually increases over time to a stable level, while the selectivity to hydrocarbons decreases over time at each tested temperature. This behavior could be due to dispersion of K2CO3 taking place during the reaction, as it is known that K2CO3 is critical for alcohol synthesis over bulk molybdenum carbide [34]. 3.2.2 Effect of support Fig. 3 shows the CO conversion and the selectivity to different products at steady state over bulk and supported (5wt% loading) Mo2C catalysts at 250°C. The CO conversion is at the same level for all supported carbides (2.4%, 3.6%, and 4.6% for AC_5_14K, CNT_5_14K, and TiO2_5_14K, respectively), which is comparable to the bulk carbide (3.8%). However, the activity of the supported carbides based on Mo weight is 12 to 24 times higher than the bulk carbide. The TiO2 supported catalyst shows the highest activity, although the catalyst has the lowest BET surface area. The higher activity of TiO2 supported carbide compared to the other supported catalysts could be related to the special properties of TiO2. It is known that TiO2 can transfer electrons from Ti3+ to metals supported on it, which changes their catalytic properties [29,54]. The product composition for the TiO2 supported catalyst resembles the bulk carbide, and shows the highest selectivity to higher alcohols (34.3Cmol%) and a high selectivity to hydrocarbons (46.2Cmol%). The active carbon supported catalyst exhibits the highest total selectivity to alcohols (62Cmol%) with methanol being the main alcohol, and consequently also produces the lowest amount of hydrocarbons. The CNT supported carbide produces mainly methanol and hydrocarbons. As shown in Table 2, the surface areas of the supports (AC, CNT and TiO2) are very different, which probably also leads to a variation of the particle size of Mo2C (5wt% Mo2C loading on all supports) on the different supports. For all the 5wt% Mo2C samples, the particles are too small to be seen by XRD or are in an amorphous form. In addition, the added amount of K2CO3 for the catalysts in Fig. 3 corresponds to a molar ratio of K/Mo=0.14. However, K2CO3 may also be partly deposited on the support leading to less than optimal promoter levels on the active materials. Hence, both the particle size of the supported carbide clusters on different supports and the extent of K-Mo contact can be the origin of the differences among the supports. As described in section 3.1, TiO2 is unstable during high temperature (750°C) carburization, leading to a loss of surface area. However, our recent in situ studies of the carburization process show that the required carburization temperature decreases with a decrease in the particle size of the oxide precursors [55]. Therefore, TiO2 could still be an interesting support for Mo2C for higher alcohol synthesis, if the carburization temperature could be decreased to below 550°C to prevent the phase transition of TiO2 from high surface area anatase to the low surface area rutile. The behavior of the CNT supported sample lies in between the AC and TiO2 supported samples. However, the high cost of CNT makes it less attractive than the AC as a support. AC supported Mo2C retains a large surface area after carburization and has the highest alcohol selectivity and lowest hydrocarbon selectivity. Hence, this catalyst seems attractive for further development, where increasing the loading of Mo2C on AC could be a potential way to increase the activity while keeping the selectivity high (in section 3.2.4). 3.2.3 Effect of temperature Table 3 shows the catalytic performance of the AC_5_14K and TiO2_5_14K catalysts in CO hydrogenation at various temperatures. For the AC_5_14K catalyst the selectivity to higher alcohols remains constant at about 12Cmol% below 300°C, but then decreases to about 6Cmol% at 326°C. From 250 to 326°C the selectivity to hydrocarbons increases from 25.2Cmol% to 71.6Cmol%, while methanol and higher alcohols selectivities decrease. Regarding the TiO2_5_14K catalyst, both the CO conversion and the hydrocarbon selectivity increase steeply with increasing temperature. The higher alcohol selectivity is 34.3Cmol% at 250°C, but the selectivities to both methanol and higher alcohols decrease significantly, when the temperature is increased. 3.2.4 Effect of the loading of active materials Fig. 4 shows for AC supported catalysts the effect of the Mo2C loading on the steady state CO conversion and the product selectivity at 275°C. The bulk Mo2C catalyst (100wt% in Fig. 4) suffers from a low specific surface area, which leads to a low activity for CO hydrogenation [34]. The CO conversion and selectivity to different products vary with the Mo2C loading. AC_20_14K exhibits the highest CO conversion, and a similar tendency can be observed at 250°C and 300°C as well (see Fig.S4 in the supplementary material). Decreasing the level of active material below 20wt% leads to a loss of activity due to dilution from the support. The high selectivity to hydrocarbons might be caused by insufficient loading of the K2CO3 promoter. It has previously been found, that the selectivity to alcohols increases with increasing K2CO3 content up to 10wt% over the bulk carbide (molar ratio of K/Mo=0.14) [34]. In this study, the added amount of K2CO3 for the catalysts in Fig. 4 corresponds to a molar ratio of K/Mo=0.14. However, K2CO3 may be partly deposited also on the support leading to less than optimal promoter levels on the active materials, particularly at low loading of Mo2C. The selectivity to higher alcohols increases with increasing Mo2C loading on AC and reaches a maximum over bulk carbides, while the selectivity to methanol follows the opposite trend. According to our recent studies [55], involving in situ carburization and extended X-ray absorption of fine structure investigations, we found that the Mo-C coordination numbers (CN) in molybdenum carbide structures are 3.2, 3.9, and 4.2 for bulk Mo2C, 40wt% Mo2C/AC and 20wt% Mo2C/AC, respectively. Moreover, Shou and Davis [56] reported that MgO supported (5wt%) Mo2C showed higher CN of Mo-C/O (CN=5.1) than bulk Mo2C (CN=3). These results indicate that the structure/composition of the supported carbide clusters differs from that of the bulk carbide. The change in the structure/composition of the supported carbide clusters may change the electronic structure of the catalytic surface, and consequently affect the catalytic properties. Our studies have also shown that the carbide particle size decreases with decreasing Mo loading on AC [55]. The variation in particle size with carbide loading may also affect the catalytic properties. One would expect smaller particles to have a larger amount of steps and defects that should bind carbon and oxygen more strongly. Smaller particles may therefore have a larger oxygen coverage at the reaction conditions. Density functional theory calculations by Medford et al. [57] showed that oxygen is present in the carbide surface – even in syngas and that increasing oxygen coverage leads to a weakening of the carbon and oxygen binding energies on the surface. Such a weakening of the binding energies would also be expected to influence the catalytic properties. This could be one of the reasons why the catalytic properties of the supported carbides are different from the properties of the bulk carbide. Fig. 5 shows the detailed distributions of alcohols and hydrocarbons that are obtained with varying loadings of Mo2C on AC at steady state. The main alcohols are methanol and ethanol, and the dominant hydrocarbon is methane for both bulk and supported carbides. Bulk carbide typically produces a certain amount of alkenes as by products [35,36,56]. The trends in alkenes and alcohols are similar [35,56]. The bulk carbide produces the most ethanol and ethene, and the lower loading of Mo2C on AC results in smaller amounts of ethanol and ethene, but higher amounts of methanol. 3.2.5 Effect of K2CO3 loading The K2CO3 promoter plays an essential role for higher alcohol synthesis over bulk Mo2C and it has been found that the selectivity to higher alcohols reaches a maximum at a molar ratio of K/Mo=0.14 [34]. The amount of K2CO3 has a major influence on both activity and selectivity to different products [34]. Here, the molar ratios of K/Mo are kept constant (0.14) for all other catalysts. However, a dilution effect of the support should be considered. The 20wt% Mo2C/AC catalyst exhibits the highest activity, and therefore the effect of the K2CO3 loading on the 20wt% Mo2C/AC catalyst has been investigated further. As shown in Fig. 6 , unpromoted Mo2C/AC exhibits a high CO conversion with hydrocarbons as the dominant products (98.4Cmol%). Upon addition of K2CO3 to Mo2C/AC, the overall CO conversion is reduced, while the product distribution shifts from hydrocarbons to alcohols. The increase in alcohol selectivity continues until a molar ratio of K/Mo=0.21, where both selectivities to higher alcohols and to alcohols in general reach a maximum. By addition of K2CO3 corresponding to K/Mo=0.28, the selectivity to alcohols increases from 1.6Cmol% to 70.2Cmol%, while the selectivity to hydrocarbons decreases from 98.4Cmol% to 28.5Cmol% and CO conversion declines from 47.2% to 3.5% compared to the unpromoted carbide. This trend indicates that molybdenum carbides are active species for CO hydrogenation, and yet the presence of K2CO3 promoter is required for a high selectivity to alcohols, which is generally in agreement with the observations from K2CO3 promoted bulk carbide [34]. The effect of an alkali promoter on Mo2C catalysts seems critical for producing alcohols. Lee et al. [35] have evaluated the role of different anions to potassium such as K2CO3, KOH, and CH3COOK over Mo2C. They suggested that the alkali promoter has an electronic effect by changing the surface electron density and a geometric effect by blocking the surface sites for adsorption of reactants [35]. The electronic effect could be related to both the adsorption/dissociation of CO on the K-doped Mo2C surface and a stabilizing effect of K on oxygen containing intermediates. According to density functional theory calculations, Pistonesi et al. [58] found that the adsorption of CO is energetically more favorable in the presence of K preadsorbed on the Mo2C surface and that the activation energy for CO dissociation increases with the K content on the surface of Mo2C. Furthermore Anderson and Yu [59] studied the formation of hydrocarbons and alcohols over MoS2 using molecular orbital theory, and these authors suggest that the K cation should be able to stabilize the oxygen containing reaction intermediates and thereby shift the selectivity toward alcohols. In line with this suggestion Farkas and Solymosi [60] studied the adsorption of methanol and ethanol on a carburized molybdenum surface and observed that the deposition of K on the carburized surface led to very stable CH3O-K and C2H5O-K surface species. This stabilization of the oxygen containing intermediates could be part of the explanation for the improved alcohol selectivity of the alkali promoted carbide. The geometric effect involves the blockage of surface sites that are potential sites for the adsorption of reactants, as it can be seen that the CO conversion rate declines with increasing of K2CO3 loading. 3.2.6 Productivity of alcohols The space time yields (STY) of alcohols shown in Fig. 7 emphasize that the AC supported Mo2C catalysts behave better than bulk carbides, although the majority of the increased alcohol production comes from methanol. At 275°C the AC_20_14K (2wt% K2CO3 promoted 20wt% Mo2C/AC), produces two times more higher alcohols and about 3 times more methanol compared to bulk carbides. Hence, it is possible to raise the alcohol productivity through the use of the active carbon support."
8,Conclusion,"The catalytic activity of potassium promoted molybdenum carbide supported on different materials such as active carbon, carbon nanotubes, and titanium dioxide for higher alcohol synthesis from syngas is significantly affected by the nature of the support. Supporting molybdenum carbide on a suitable carrier such as active carbon, can improve both the activity and selectivity to alcohols compared to the bulk carbide. However, the performance in higher alcohol production is still not sufficient for industrial applications. Titanium dioxide seems to be a promising support due to its better selectivity to higher alcohols, however, the thermal stability of TiO2 limits its application as a support for carbides due to the high carburization temperature (750°C in the present experiments). An interesting option would be to decrease the carburization temperature below 550°C (the phase transition temperature for TiO2 from high surface area anatase to the low surface area rutile [47,48]) for example by decreasing the particle size of molybdenum oxide. Moreover, the productivity of higher alcohols could potentially be improved through optimization of the Mo2C loading on TiO2. The selectivity to hydrocarbons over the Mo2C/TiO2 sample is still too high. One possibility to suppress the hydrocarbon formation is to increase the K2CO3 loading, but this will also be expected to lower the activity. The potassium carbonate promoter plays an essential role in obtaining alcohols rather than hydrocarbons (unpromoted AC supported Mo2C produces predominantly hydrocarbons). The optimum selectivity toward higher alcohols and to total alcohols was obtained at a K/Mo molar ratio of 0.21 over the 20wt% Mo2C on active carbon, which is higher than the optimum ratio for the bulk carbide (K/Mo=0.14). It is likely that the support material dilutes the promoter contents on the carbide. The selectivity to higher alcohols increases with increasing the Mo2C loading on AC (at fixed K/Mo=0.14) and reaches a maximum over bulk carbides, while the selectivity to methanol follows the opposite trend. This effect of the Mo2C loading on the selectivity could be related to the loadings of K2CO3 on the active Mo2C phase and the size, structure and composition of the supported carbide clusters."
