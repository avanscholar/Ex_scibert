0,Introduction,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide (Mulero et al., 2012). Oxidative stress, inflammation status, endothelial dysfunction, and imbalanced carbohydrate and lipid metabolism play a major role in the onset and progression of CVD. An increased concentration of plasma/blood low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is one of the main risk factors for CVD. The LDL-C oxidation causes the activation of endothelium leading to the accumulation of cholesterol esters and the formation of foam cells responsible for the fatty streaks that are the hallmark of atherosclerosis (Holvoet, De Keyzer, & Jacobs, 2008). The intake of fruit, vegetables, and plant-derived beverages has beneficial effects against CVD (Pérez-Burillo, Oliveras, Quesada, Rufián-Henaresa, & Pastoriza, 2018). This is attributed to its bioactive compounds, which exert antioxidant (Park et al., 2015), anti-inflammatory (Sergent, Piront, Meurice, Toussaint, & Schneider, 2010), hypotensive (Balasuriya & Rupasinghe, 2011), and anticoagulant actions (Tome-Carneiro et al., 2012) and have a favorable impact on the metabolism of lipids and carbohydrates (Hanhineva et al., 2010). In particular, orange juice (OJ) not only contains high levels of key nutrients, including vitamins C and B-6, folate, thiamin, magnesium, and potassium (O'Neil, Nicklas, Rampersaud, & Fulgoni III, 2012) but also represents a major source of polyphenols, carotenoids, and melatonin (Abad-García, Garmon-Lobato, Berrueta, Gallo, & Vicente, 2012; Johns, Johns, Porasuphatana, Plaimee, & Sae-Teaw, 2013; Meléndez-Martínez, Vicario, & Heredia, 2007). OJ consumption has demonstrated preventive and therapeutic effects against CVD in healthy individuals and in humans with cardiovascular risk factors, respectively (Bernabé et al., 2013; Dourado & Cesar, 2015; Silveira, Dourado, & Cesar, 2015). We highlight the finding by numerous authors that OJ consumption reduces LDL-C levels in hypercholesterolemic individuals (Aptekmann & Cesar, 2013; Contans et al., 2015). Moderate alcohol consumption (30 g/day for men) has also been associated with a decrease in cardiovascular risk and mortality (Chiva-Blanch et al., 2015; Estruch et al., 2004). Although, current knowledge imply controversy over the cardioprotective effect of alcohol, since there is not enough evidence for a clear positioning (Goel, Sharma, & Garg, 2018; Piano, 2017), the trend is that low to moderate (up to 1 drink -equivalent to about 12 g of ethanol- per day in women, up to 2 in men) fermented beverages (wine, beer, and other fruit-derived beverages) consumption, in the absence of specific contraindications and in the context of healthy eating and a healthy lifestyle, would substantially decrease cardiovascular risk compared to abstainers or heavy/binge drinkers (De Gaetano et al., 2016), due to both their alcoholic content and their non-alcoholic bioactive components (mainly polyphenols) (De Gaetano et al., 2016; Snopek et al., 2018). Also, mounting evidence suggests that ethanol and polyphenols can synergistically confer benefits against chronic cardiovascular diseases (Haseeb, Alexander, & Baranchuk, 2017). Our group previously observed in both healthy mice and those with high-fat-diet-induced metabolic syndrome that consumption of a low-alcohol orange beverage (OB) derived from the alcoholic fermentation of OJ provides greater protection against cardiovascular risk factors in comparison to non-fermented OJ, supporting the proposal of synergy between the bioactive compounds of the fruit and the alcohol (Escudero-Lopez et al., 2015; Escudero-López, Fernández-Pachón et al., 2016). Recently, we have also obtained that carotenoids from OB are more bioavailable than from OJ, probably due to modifications in the matrix of OJ caused by alcoholic fermentation and pasteurization (Hornero-Méndez et al., 2018). The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effect of low-alcohol orange beverage consumption on the lipid profile, antioxidant status, oxidative stress, endothelial function, and inflammation status of hypercholesterolemic humans."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Reagents,"2.1 Reagents Chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Quimica (Alcobendas, Spain)."
3,Orange beverage production,"2.2 Orange beverage production The orange beverage (OB) under study was produced by Grupo Hesperides Biotech S.L. and Mitra Sol Technologies S.L. using a commercial OJ made from Citrus sinensis L. var. Navel late (Huelva, Spain). The OJ was fermented on a semi-industrial scale in 100-L stainless steel tanks, under aseptic conditions, at 22 °C for 10 days in repose. The yeast strain used was Saccharomycetaceae var. Pichia kluyveri, previously isolated from the natural microbiota in the orange fruit. This yeast strain ferments only reducing sugars, resulting in a final product with low alcohol content (1% v/v) and sweet taste. The fermented juice underwent thermal pasteurization at 80 °C for 30 s in a semi-tubular pasteurizer at 25 L/h (Mipaser Prototype, Murcia, Spain), and the product was cooled to 10 °C in an ice water bath. The fermented pasteurized juice underwent carbonation up to a pressure of 4.4 × 104 Pa and was then aseptically filled into aluminum containers (250 mL) and stored at 4 °C until its consumption. The shelf-life of OB is of 12 months from date of packing in the containers. The quality parameters, nutritional composition, bioactive compounds profile, and antioxidant capacity of the OB, analyzed as described by Escudero-Lopez et al. (2013), OIV (2014), and Cerrillo et al. (2015), were previously published (Escudero-López et al., 2018)."
4,Participants,"2.3 Participants Eighteen individuals (8 men and 10 women) were enrolled in the study, with mean age of 36.5 ± 1.8 years and BMI of 26.37 ± 1.79 kg/m2. Their median baseline cholesterol values were moderately high, with total cholesterol (TC) of 260 ± 22 mg/dL and LDL-C of 156 ± 6 mg/dL, as determined by the clinical laboratory of Virgen del Rocio Hospital using routine tests. The health status and healthy habits of volunteers were evaluated through their medical history, anthropometric measurements, routine laboratory tests, lifestyle questionnaire, and three-day food record. Exclusion criteria included: the documented presence of CVD, diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus infection, chronic renal and/or liver disease, malnutrition, neoplastic or acute infectious disease, abnormal baseline blood test results (except for cholesterol markers), tobacco consumption, use of any medication or nutritional supplement in the previous three months, and the consumption of more than six portions of beer or wine per week. All participants gave their written informed consent to participate in the study, which was carried out in accordance with the Helsinki declaration and was approved by the ethical committee of Virgen del Rocio Hospital (IEC 2013PI/022)."
5,Study design,"2.4 Study design The 18 hypercholesterolemic volunteers were randomly assigned to one of two groups: OB group (n = 9) and control group (n = 9). A balanced gender distribution per group was taken into account. OB group consumed 500 mL OB (2 packs of 250 mL) per day for two weeks, and control group did not consume OB over the two-week study period. The OB was consumed by participants during the first month of shelf-life. Blood samples were drawn after overnight fasting for 12 h at the beginning and end of the study period. Volunteers were asked to make no changes in their lifestyle, diet, or level of physical activity during the study period. They were also instructed to limit the intake of beer or wine to a maximum of six portions per week and to avoid the intake of spirit beverages over the study period."
6,Collection of blood samples and biochemical measurements,"2.5 Collection of blood samples and biochemical measurements Blood samples (20 mL) were drawn from antecubital vein into EDTA-containing vials and then centrifuged at 12000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C within 1 h of collection. The resulting samples (plasma and erythrocytes) were apportioned into 0.5 mL aliquots and frozen at −80 °C until biomarker analyses. Biochemical measurements (glucose, insulin, creatinine, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT)) were carried out by routine tests at the clinical laboratory of Virgen del Rocio Hospital."
7,Anthropometric measurements,"2.6 Anthropometric measurements The following anthropometric measurements were obtained: weight, height, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC). A model 780 SECA weight/scale (SECA, Hamburg, Germany) was used to measure height and body weight with the participant in underwear and bare feet. BMI was calculated by dividing the weight (kg) by the height squared (m2). A model 201 SECA flexible tape (SECA) was used to measure the WC around the narrowest portion of the torso. All measurements were obtained using standardized procedures and periodically calibrated instruments (Lohman, Roche, & Martorell, 1988)."
8,Determination of lipid profile,"2.7 Determination of lipid profile Triglycerides (TG), TC, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and LDL-C were measured in plasma samples by enzymatic spectrophotometry (Roche Diagnostics, Madrid, Spain) using a Roche Cobas 8000 Modular Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics). LDL-C/HDL-C and TC/HDL-C ratios were also calculated. Plasma apolipoprotein (Apo) A-I and Apo B concentrations were determined using commercial kits (Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, USA) and Cloud Clone Corporation (Katy, USA), respectively), recording measurements on a SynergyTM HT-multimode microplate reader (Biotek Instruments, Winooski, USA)."
9,Determination of antioxidant status,"2.8 Determination of antioxidant status Plasma antioxidant capacity (PAC) was evaluated by oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. The ORAC assay was performed according to Ou, Hampsch-Woodill, and Prior (2001), diluting plasma samples (1:1000) in phosphate buffer (75 mM, pH 7.4). The FRAP assay followed the method of Delgado-Andrade, Rufian-Henares, and Morales (2005), diluting plasma samples (1:8) in distilled water. PAC measurements were recorded on a SynergyTM HT-multimode microplate reader (Biotek Instruments). The endogenous antioxidants albumin, bilirubin, and uric acid were measured in plasma samples by enzymatic spectrophotometry (Roche Diagnostics) using a Roche Cobas C 701 Modular Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics). Total glutathione levels were determined in plasma samples with a commercial kit (Cayman Chemical Company), recording measurements on a SynergyTM HT-multimode microplate reader (Biotek Instruments). Antioxidant enzyme activities were measured in erythrocyte samples. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR) were determined as previously described by McCord and Fridovich (1969), Cohen and Somerson (1969), Carmagnol, Sinet, and Jerome (1983), and Cribb, Leeder, and Spielberg (1989), respectively. Samples were hemolyzed in miliQ water (1:4, v:v) and then vortexed for 5 s and centrifuged at 14000 x g (30 min, 4 °C). The resulting supernatants were collected and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Measurements were recorded on a SynergyTM HT-multimode microplate reader (Biotek Instruments). Total protein content was assessed by standard Bradford assay (Bradford, 1976)."
10,Determination of oxidative stress,"2.9 Determination of oxidative stress Lipid peroxidation was evaluated according to the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) and oxidized LDL (oxLDL). TBARS was measured in hemolyzed erythrocyte samples according to Buege and Aust (1978), expressing results as malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations. The concentration of oxLDL was measured in plasma samples with a commercially available kit (Cell Biolabs Inc., San Diego, USA). TBARS and oxLDL measurements were recorded on a SynergyTM HT-multimode microplate reader (Biotek Instruments)."
11,Determination of endothelial function and inflammation status,"2.10 Determination of endothelial function and inflammation status Soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1) were evaluated in plasma samples using commercial kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA). C-reactive protein (CRP) content was determined in plasma samples with a commercially available kit from Immundiagnostik AG (Bensheim, Germany). All of these measurements were recorded on a SynergyTM HT-multimode microplate reader (Biotek Instruments)."
12,Statistical analysis,"2.11 Statistical analysis Values were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess the normal distribution of variables. Variables were compared between baseline and the end of the two-week study period in each group using Student's t-test when they were normally distributed and the Wilcoxon test when they were not. Differences with p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. SPSS version 22 (IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY) was used for statistical analyses."
13,Results,"The OB used in this study is a rich source of bioactive compounds (Table 1 ) which were described previously by Escudero-López et al. (2018). Our results show that it contains 11 phenolic compounds (total of 836 nmol/L) and 13 carotenoids (total of 17.8 μmol/L). Total flavanones accounted for 79.8% of total phenolics and total flavones for 17.1%. The most abundant phenolic compounds were hesperidin (445 nmol/L), narirutin (133 nmol/L), and vicenin-2 (130 nmol/L). Among carotenoids, karpoxanthin (1.60 μmol/L), neochrome (1.41 μmol/L), auroxanthin (4.33 μmol/L), mutatoxanthin (2.77 μmol/L), (allE)-zeaxanthin (1.81 μmol/L), β-cryptoxanthin (2.43 μmol/L), and ζ-carotene (1.41 μmol/L) accounted for 88.5% of total carotenoids. Carotenoids with provitamin A activity (β-carotene, α-carotene, and β-cryptoxanthin) are also present (provitamin A value = 71 RAEs/L). ORAC and FRAP assays revealed that the antioxidant capacity of the OB was similar to that of OJ and higher than that of white wine, beer, or other fruit juices (e.g., apple, pineapple, or apricot juice) (Mullen, Marks, & Crozier, 2007; Pellegrini et al., 2003). ORAC values can also be compared with data present in the ORAC Database (2018). Selection of the daily amount of OB to be consumed in the study was based on observations in healthy mice (Escudero-Lopez et al., 2015). Interestingly, despite the daily intake of 24 g of total sugars and 160 kcal from the OB, no significant changes were observed in weight, BMI, WC, glucose, or insulin after its consumption for two weeks, which also had no effect on renal/liver function biomarkers (creatinine, GOT, or GPT). No participants withdrew from the study or reported any problem related to the OB consumption. Table 2 exhibits the baseline biomarker results in all participants (n = 18). These baseline values did not significantly differ between the OB (n = 9) and control (n = 9) groups (data not shown). Table 3 displays the changes in these biomarkers after daily intake of the OB for two weeks. In the OB group, there was a significant reduction versus baseline in plasma levels of TC (from 260.2 ± 21.7 to 219.6 ± 10.9 mg/dL; p = 0.011), LDL-C (155.7 ± 6.3 to 127.9 ± 8.5 mg/dL; p < 0.001) and LDL-C/HDL-C (2.8 ± 0.3 to 2.2 ± 0.3; p < 0.001), whereas there was no significant change in levels of TG, HDL-C, TC/HDL-C, Apo A-I, or Apo B. In the control group, there was no change in any of these lipid metabolism markers over the two-week study period. A significant reduction in CAT activity was observed in the OB group (from 17.61 ± 1.44 to 13.06 ± 0.80 U/mg protein; p = 0.035) but not in the control group, while there was no change in the other antioxidant status markers in either group. Regarding oxidative stress markers, the OB group showed a significant decrease in TBARS versus baseline (from 4.26 ± 0.40 nmol EqMDA/mL to 7.46 ± 0.21 nmol EqMDA/mL; p = 0.018), but there was no change in oxLDL levels in either group. The study of endothelial dysfunction and inflammation status markers showed a significant decrease versus baseline of sVCAM-1 in the OB group (502.83 ± 35.24 to 473.85 ± 37.41 ng/mL; p = 0.047), with no change in the control group. No significant change in sICAM-1 or CRP was observed in either group at the end of the two-week study period."
14,Discussion,"The current manuscript is a preliminary study about the effects of a low-alcohol orange beverage on the cardiovascular risk of hypercholesterolemic individuals. Results obtained indicate that daily consumption of 500 mL of the OB under study exerts a beneficial effect on the lipid profile of hypercholesterolemic humans. The median TC and LDL-C levels of participants were above normal at baseline (260 ± 22 mg/dL and 156 ± 6 mg/dL, respectively) and were significantly reduced after two weeks of daily OB consumption, with a significant decrease in the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio. OB consumption had no significant impact on TG or HDL-C levels or on the TC/HDL-C ratio. A recent study carried out by Moreira et al. (2018) in healthy humans showed that the intake of 500 mL of orange juice/day for 2 weeks reduced cholesterol levels. Some authors have obtained changes in lipid profile of subjects with cardiovascular risk factors using greater volume of orange juice/citrus juice and/or longer period of daily intake. Mulero et al. (2012) also observed a significant decrease in LDL-C in metabolic syndrome patients after the daily consumption of 300 mL citrus juice for six months. In the same line, the daily consumption of 750 mL OJ for eight weeks was found to improve the lipid profile (reduction in TC and/or LDL-C) in normal and overweight individuals (Dourado & Cesar, 2015) and in metabolic syndrome patients (Silveira et al., 2015). Hypolipidemic effect could be promoted by the bioactive compounds present in orange juice. The possible mechanisms could include the reduction of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A and acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase activities, resulting in reduced VLDL secretion and consequently reduced circulating LDL-C, and/or the increase of LDL-C receptors expression in the liver (Bok et al., 1999; Lee et al., 1999; Silveira et al., 2015). In contrast, no change in lipid profile was observed in men with mild hypercholesterolemia after the daily consumption of 600 mL OJ for 4 weeks (Contans et al., 2015) or the consumption of 250 mL/day of OJ for 12 weeks (Simpson, Mendis, & MacDonald, 2016). Rangel-Huerta et al. (2015) also found no significant difference in TC, HDL-C, or LDL-C concentrations in overweight and obese volunteers after the daily intake of 500 mL OJ for 12 weeks. Varied contents of bioactive compounds between the samples could explain the different results in humans with some cardiovascular risk factor, but the phenolic and carotenoid contents of OB were similar to those of OJ subjected to fermentation process, and other commercial orange juices (Escudero-López, Cerrillo et al., 2016). Thus, the positive impact of OB on the lipid profile after a daily intake of 500 mL for only 2 weeks may be mainly explained by two aspects: synergistic effects of the bioactive compounds and alcohol in the fermented beverage, and an improved bioavailability of carotenoids from OB versus OJ, probably due to modifications in the matrix of OJ caused by alcoholic fermentation and pasteurization. In a previous study of healthy mice by our group, daily intake of the OB (at a volume equivalent to 250 mL in humans) for 12 weeks achieved a similar improvement in lipid profile, which was not observed in mice consuming OJ, supporting the proposition of synergy between the juice and moderate alcohol content (Escudero-Lopez et al., 2015). On the other hand, post-intake plasma carotenoid concentrations were measured in 7 healthy subjects at 0–8 h after their consumption of OJ or OB. β-Cryptoxanthin and lutein absorption was significantly higher from OB than from OJ (Hornero-Méndez et al., 2018). No significant changes in Apo A-I or B levels were observed in either group. A significant increase in Apo A-I but significant decrease in Apo B was observed after the daily intake of 500 mL OJ for 12 weeks (Rangel-Huerta et al., 2015), and an increase in Apo A-1 levels was reported after the daily consumption of 600 mL OJ for 4 weeks (Contans et al., 2015). These discrepancies with the present results may be attributable to differences in the intake volume and/or length of the study period. With respect to antioxidant status, CAT activity was reduced by OB consumption, similar to previous reports on OJ. Thus, a significant reduction in this activity was reported in obese and overweight humans after the daily intake of 500 mL OJ for 12 weeks (Rangel-Huerta et al., 2015) and in men with mild hypercholesterolemia after the daily consumption of 600 mL OJ for 4 weeks (Contans et al., 2015). This effect may be attributable to the scavenging activity of hesperidin, which reduces superoxide anions and consequently the amount of lipid peroxide and hydrogen peroxide generated during normal cell metabolism, reducing the need for CAT biosynthesis (Wilmsen, Spada, & Salvador, 2005). Vitamin C intake may also contribute to this effect (Contans et al., 2015). No changes were observed in SOD, GPx, or GR activities in the present study or after the consumption of 600 mL/day OJ for 4 weeks by men with mild hypercholesterolemia (Contans et al., 2015) or 500 mL/day OJ for 2 weeks by obese/overweight individuals (Rangel-Huerta et al., 2015). In relation to levels of endogenous antioxidants (uric acid, glutathione, albumin and bilirubin) and PAC, no significant differences with baseline values were observed after daily OB consumption (Table 3). Similar FRAP values to the present results were reported in healthy humans consuming 500 mL OJ/day for 4 weeks (Morand et al., 2011), while another study found no changes in FRAP values after the consumption of 250 mL OJ/day for 12 weeks (Ekhlasi, Shidfar, Agah, Merat, & Hosseini, 2016). Contans et al. (2015) showed higher FRAP and ORAC values after the intake of OJ by men with mild hypercholesterolemia (600 mL/day for 4 weeks). A large volume consumed over a longer time would derive in higher plasmatic concentrations of bioactive compounds and/or their metabolites, which could explain the increased PAC in comparison to the present findings. Oxidation of LDL is considered one of the main etiological factors in atherogenesis because of its increased capacity to adhere to the arterial wall. In addition, oxidation of membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids initiates a self-propagating chain reaction that destroys membrane lipids, and the end-products of these reactions are hazardous for the viability of cells (Mylonas & Kouretas, 1999). Hence, the protective effect of exogenous antioxidants against lipid peroxidation may impede the pathogenesis of CVD. MDA levels, determined by TBARS assay, were significantly decreased by OB consumption in the present hypercholesterolemic individuals, whereas Ox-LDL levels were unchanged. In previous studies, a reduction in MDA was also observed in normal and overweight individuals after the consumption of 750 mL OJ/day for 8 weeks (Dourado & Cesar, 2015) and in hypercholesterolemic individuals after the consumption of 590 mL OJ/day for 90 days (Foroudi, Potter, Stamatikos, Patil, & Deyhim, 2014). A significant decrease in oxLDL was reported in patients with the metabolic syndrome after the consumption of 300 mL/day citrus juice for 6 months (Mulero et al., 2012). These beneficial effects of the OB may be attributable to the flavonoids and carotenoids it contains, which participate in scavenging the singlet molecular oxygen (1O2) and peroxyl radicals generated by lipid peroxidation (Tapiero, Townsend, & Tew, 2004; Tirkey, Pilkhwal, Kuhad, & Chopra, 2005). Vitamin C has showed equally effect at reducing plasma lipid peroxidation (Johnston, Dancho, & Strong, 2003; Sánchez-Moreno et al., 2003). In addition to it, it could be supposed that the low alcohol content of OB would contribute to the protective effect against lipid peroxidation through the upregulation of liver paraoxonase 1 mRNA and the inhibition of LDL oxidation (Rao et al., 2003). Rangel-Huerta et al. (2015) found no modifications in either oxLDL or MDA in obese and overweight individuals consuming the same volume of OJ (500 mL) as in our study for a longer period of time (12 weeks). Thus, the previously commented synergistic effect of the bioactive compounds and alcohol in OB and the improved bioavailability of carotenoids from OB could be suggested. Intake of the OB by the hypercholesterolemic participants significantly decreased sVCAM-1 levels but had no impact on sICAM-1 levels. Previous studies found no significant change in these endothelial function markers in men with mild hypercholesterolemia after the consumption of 600 mL/day OJ for 4 weeks (Contans et al., 2015) or in overweight individuals after the consumption of 500 mL/day OJ for the same period (Morand et al., 2011). The positive effect of the OB on sVCAM-1 levels may be explained by the previously reported inverse association between levels of endothelial adhesion molecules and alcohol intake (Estruch et al., 2004; Shai et al., 2006). A reduction in VCAM-1 levels has also been associated with intake of the ethanol and bioactive compounds in red wine (Chiva-Blanch et al., 2012). OB consumption had no significant impact on CRP values. A significant reduction in CRP was reported in the metabolic syndrome patients who consumed 300 mL citrus juice/day for 6 months (Mulero et al., 2012) and in the healthy humans who consumed 750 mL OJ/day for 8 weeks (Dourado & Cesar, 2015; Silveira et al., 2015). Study limitations include the fact that no attempt was made to exclude bioactive compounds from the participants' diet. This decision was taken to make the trial more realistic, but a stricter control of their intake might have reduced the variability in results. The study could also be conducted for longer than 2 weeks to explore the effect of the bioactive compounds and moderate alcohol content in OB. Moreover, wider samples are warranted to support the present findings. Considering these limitations, the results obtained should be interpreted with caution and verified in future studies."
15,Conclusions,"The orange beverage derived from alcoholic fermentation of orange juice is a natural source of bioactive compounds and low alcohol content. Its daily consumption by hypercholesterolemic individuals for two weeks produced an improvement in their lipid profile and a reduction of endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress biomarkers. Although these results suggest that intake of this novel product may have protective effects against cardiovascular risk factors in hypercholesterolemic humans, due to small sample size and the short intervention period, the potential statistical effect observed does not permit to completely ensure these conclusions. So, future research is necessary to consider the orange beverage as a functional beverage to be consumed as part of a healthy diet."
