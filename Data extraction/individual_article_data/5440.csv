0,Introduction,"Due to the capacity of nitrogen donor ligands of stabilizing and modulating the reactivity of organometallic complexes, the design and development of alternative nitrogen ligands such as triazenes has been a topic of interest in the coordination and organometallic chemistry [1,2]. Triazenes are versatile compounds of great utility as anticancer agents, in organic synthesis, synthesis of polymers, and in coordination chemistry as ligand precursors [3]. Deprotonation of the triazene gives the triazenide ligand, which can easily coordinate to transition metal centers and stabilize monomeric [4–7] and polymeric complexes [7–10] in different oxidation states. 1,3-Bis(aryl)triazenide ligands ortho-substituted with aryl groups [11,12] and donor groups as esters, ethers, and thioethers have been relatively well studied [13–28]. However, coordination chemistry of triazenide systems substituted with N-heterocycles has been less studied. In the literature few examples of complexes with triazenide ligands substituted with pyrazole [29], imidazole [30] triazole [31,32], tetrazole [33,34], benzothiazole [35,36] and pyridine [37–40] are reported. Catalytic processes where the basic nitrogen works as hydrogen acceptor achieving the activation of the substrate to give way to the chemical transformation have been reported [41–43]. The transfer hydrogenation (TH) of ketones is a key process for the production of a variety of alcohols, which are important products and precursors in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, flavor, fragrances, materials, and fine chemical industries [44,45]. 2-Propanol as solvent and hydrogen source is ideal because is cheap, environmentally friendly and nontoxic [46,47]. In general, inner and outer coordination sphere with ancillary ligand assistance mechanisms have been proposed, where the metal hydride is the active species and a base is needed to generate it through β-H elimination from a metal alkoxide intermediate [48–50]. However, sometimes the presence of a base is undesired, since it can affect the stereo selectivity of the product; also, there are base sensitive ketones [51] and aldehydes [52], which produce corrosion and reduce the life time of the equipment [53–55]. Therefore, metal hydride complexes have been developed and used directly [51,56–59]. However, metal hydride complexes generally are air and water sensitive and in consequence not easy to handle [50]. Alkenones are substrates of certain difficulty due to the possibility to be either selectively hydrogenated at the CO, the CC bond, or non-selectively hydrogenated of both functional groups. Therefore, hydrogenation of alkenones via catalysis is an attractive strategy to induce selectivity, of which there are several examples in the literature of selective hydrogenation at the CO or the CC bond [60–63]. In this direction, we became interested in the selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated and γ,δ-unsaturated ketones using protic N-heterocyclic carbene IrIIICp* [64], triazenide RuII(p-cimene) [18] and triazenide IrIIICp* complexes [30]. Here we report the synthesis of an IrIIICp* complex bearing a triazenide ligand functionalized with pyrazole (2), and the evaluation of its catalytic activity in the transfer hydrogenation of aryl-ketones, alkyl-ketones, as well as α,β- and γ,δ-unsaturated ketones. Control experiments with a complex lacking of pyrazole (3) as precatalyst, were also performed in order to get insight of the pyrazole role in the catalysis (Fig. 1 )."

5,X-Ray crystallography,2.4 X-Ray crystallography The single crystal X-ray diffraction studies were carried out on a Bruker X8 APEX II CCD diffractometer equipped with Mo Ka radiation (λ = 0.71073). Crystals were mounted on a Cryoloop with Paratone oil. Data were collected in a nitrogen gas stream at 100(2) K using f and v scans. The data were integrated using the Bruker SAINT Software program and scaled using the SADABS software program. Solution by direct methods (SHELXT) produced a complete phasing model consistent with the proposed structure.All nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically by full-matrix least-squares (SHELXL). All hydrogen atoms were placed using a riding model. Their positions were constrained relative to their parent atom using the appropriate HFIX command in SHELXL. Crystallographic data are summarized in Table S1.
6,General procedure for transfer hydrogenation reactions monitored by 1H NMR and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS),"2.5 General procedure for transfer hydrogenation reactions monitored by 1H NMR and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS) In the glovebox, ketone or alken-2-one (6.3 × 10−5 mol), 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (2 µL) as internal standard and 0.7 mL of 2-propanol-d8 were transferred into a J. Young NMR tube, and a 1H NMR spectrum was recorded. The tube was brought back into the glovebox, and precatalyst 2 (1.26 × 10−6 mol in 0.2 mL of 2-propanol-d8) was added. At this point, KOH (0.5 M, 5 µL, 2 eq.) in 2-propanol-d 8 was added only to those catalytic reactions performed in presence of base. Outside of the glovebox the tube was placed inside an oil bath at 90 °C. The tube was removed from the oil bath at different times, and 1H NMR spectra were recorded in order to follow the progress of the reaction. The conversions were determined by the integration of either the aromatic protons or the aliphatic protons of the ketone. The value of the integral for the singlet due to the aromatic protons of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (internal standard) was set to 10 units. In addition, the conversion was also determined by GC–MS analysis in order to follow the deuteration process of the substrates, which is a consequence of using 2-propanol-d 8. In addition, the transfer hydrogenation reactions of some aryl- alkylketones and 5-alken-2-ones were performed as above using the same quantities of reactants (precatalyst 2 or 3 and KOH if needed) in regular 2-propanol. The analytical GC/MS system used was Agilent 7890A GC coupled to 5975C Mass detector Agilent Technologies, equipped with a HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm). An Agilent Technologies 7693 auto sampler was used to inject 1 µL of a solution sample. The ionization energy was 70 eV with a mass range of 30 to 800 m/z. The initial temperature of the column was set at 80 °C, held for 2 min, and then a ramp of 10 °C/min to 250 °C. The temperature of the injector was set at 250 °C and the detector at 230 °C. The flow rate of the carrier gas (He) was 1.0 mL/min injected with a gas dilution of 1:50. Identification of the individual components was based on comparison with the mass spectra library (NIST98)."

8,Synthesis and general characterization,"3.1 Synthesis and general characterization 3.1.1 Triazene Triazene 1 functionalized with pyrazole was synthesized with the aim of obtaining one ligand with a pendant nitrogen base able to promote bifunctional interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, proton abstraction or activation of polar and non-polar bonds. The pyrazole group in the triazene structure also has a methyl group, which provides enough steric hindrance to prevent the undesired coordination of the N-heterocycle to the metal center. Triazene 1 was synthesized by the traditional procedure of N-coupling of diazonium salts [66]. The IR spectrum of triazene 1 shows bands at 3177 cm−1 for the NH group and at 1523 cm−1 for the N3 system. The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 shows a broad singlet at 10.32 ppm assigned to the NH group (Fig. S1). In the aromatic region there are two doublets at 7.24 and 7.17 ppm, characteristic of an A2B2 system, and two doublets at 7.41 and 6.33 ppm corresponding to the hydrogens in the pyrazole ring that are coupled to each other. These assignments are supported by gCOSY, 1H–13C gHSQC and 1H–13C gHMBC correlation experiments (Figs. S3 and S4). Two singlets are observed at 3.82 and 2.31 ppm assigned to the N-CH3 and Ar-CH3, respectively. The 13C NMR spectrum of triazene 1 shows the typical signals for aromatic carbons from 142.1 to 116.7 ppm. The ipso carbons to the aryl and the pyrazol groups show signals down field at 142.1 and 159.2 ppm, respectively (Fig. S2). HRMS and EIMS confirmed the molecular weight of triazene 1 (Fig. S5). The adduct [M + Na]+ in the HRMS appears at 238.1072 m/z, whereas the molecular ion in EIMS can be seen at 215 m/z with an intensity of 8%. In addition, some characteristic fragments of the compound were also found, one at 119 m/z belonging to the loss of 1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-3-amine leaving the organic fragment [C6H4(CH3)N2]+. On the other hand, the loss of p-toluidine leaves the fragment 109 m/z assigned to [C3H2(N2CH3)N2]+. The tropylium ion [C7H7]+ was also found at 91 m/z. 3.1.2 Iridium triazenide complexes. Reaction of the ligand precursor 1 with half equivalent of [Ir(η5-C5Me5)(μ-Cl)Cl]2 in acetonitrile and in the presence of triethylamine resulted in the formation of a new monomeric complex {IrCl[Me-p-(C6H4)–NNN-(Me-1-C3H2N2)](η5-C5Me5)}, 2 (Equation 1). Complex 2 was isolated as yellow crystals and its formulation is supported by analytical and spectroscopic data (IR, NMR and HRMS), as well as X-ray crystal structure determination. In the IR spectrum of complex 2, no significant changes were observed compared to the free triazene 1, other than the disappearance of the characteristic NH stretching band at 3177 cm−1 as an evidence of the formation of the triazenide ligand, and a band at 1526 cm−1 for the coordinated triazenide system (N3). In the 1H NMR spectrum of 2, the A2B2 system of the tolyl ring gives signals shifted 0.13 ppm upfield in comparison with the free triazene (Fig. S6). The same behavior is observed for the hydrogens of the pyrazole ring, which appear as doublets at 7.34 and 6.09 ppm (J = 2.3 Hz) in comparison with the free triazene, at 7.41 and 6.33 ppm, respectively. The aromatic signals of the coordinated ligand are slightly shifted upfield compared to the free triazene due to coordination to the metal center. In addition, a similar behavior is observed in 13C NMR in which the aryl ipso carbon to the triazenide system (C1) is slightly shifted downfield at 144.9 ppm after coordination, while in the free triazene it is at 142.1 ppm (Fig. S7). However, the opposite phenomenon is observed in the pyrazole ipso carbon to the triazenide system (C3), which is shifted upfield at 157.4 ppm after coordination, while in the free triazene appears at 159.2 ppm. The sp2 and sp3 carbon signals of the ancillary ligand Cp*, show typical shifts appearing as singlets at 87.5 and 10.3 ppm, respectively [30]. The HRMS (ESI-TOF) spectrum shows a peak with m/z = 600.1465, consistent with the formation of the adduct [M + Na]+, which may be a consequence of using sodium formate as calibrant (Fig. S10). In addition, the reaction of complex 2 with NaH in 2-propanol gave a single organometallic product, which was formulated as the metal hydride 4 since its 1H NMR spectrum exhibited a high-field signal at –7.73 ppm (Scheme 1 ). Interestingly, complex 2 was also able to react with 2-propanol in the absence of NaH to form two major metal hydrides species (5 and 6 as proposed structures), which gave 1H NMR signals at –14.67 and –15.44 ppm (ratio 6 to 4). We hypothesized that these chemical shifts may be consistent with cationic complexes where the triazenide has been protonated and converted into the neutral triazene. Therefore, the hydrogen can be located either at the nitrogen substituted with the pyrazole or at the nitrogen substituted with the aryl group. The ability to form neutral or cationic hydrides species has been observed in related complexes bearing a triazenide functionalized with imidazole and also in complex 3 [30]. Moreover, neutral metal hydrides have been proposed as transient species to explain the mechanism of transfer hydrogenation performed under basic conditions; conversely, cationic metal hydrides have been proposed as transient species to explain the mechanism of transfer hydrogenation under base-free conditions [67]."
9,Description of the crystal structures,"3.2 Description of the crystal structures Crystals of 1 suitable for X-ray diffraction studies were obtained. The triazene crystallized in the monoclinic system, with space group P2(1)/n. The ORTEP diagram of 1 is shown in Fig. 2 with selected bond distances and angles, while crystal data is given in the Supporting information (Table S1). Triazene 1 adopts a trans configuration about the NN double bond and is quasi-planar with the dihedral angle between the p-tolyl and pirazol planes at 4.72°. The N(3)-N(4)N(5) bond angle is 113.68(14)°, whereas the N(3)-N(4) and N(4)N(5) bond distances at 1.2757(18) and 1.333(2) Å, respectively, indicate the presence of single and double bonds. These bond distances and angles are in agreement with those reported for related triazenes with N-heterocycles [33,35,37,38]. The crystal arrangement exhibits intermolecular N(5)–H(5 N)⋯N(3) and C(6)–H(6A)⋯N(2) hydrogen bonds [2.290(10) and 2.454(10) Å, respectively], forming a dimer with three 8-membered supramolecular rings (Fig. S15). This dimer polymerized via intermolecular hydrogen bonds with a bifurcated geometry C(2)⋯H(2B)⋯N(1) [2.883 and 2.643 Å, respectively, <27.84°] resulting in a two-dimensional network of triazene molecules. This arrangement contrasts with the dimers formed by related triazenes with N-heterocycles in which the triazene hydrogen (NH) interacts with a N-heterocycle instead of a second triazene system, forming stronger hydrogen bonds (ca. 2.01 Å) [30,33]. The structure of compound 2 was determined by X-ray diffraction methods. Compound 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic crystalline system, space group (P2(1)/c. Crystallographic data are included in Table S1. The ORTEP diagram of compound 2 is shown in Fig. 3 with selected bond distances and angles displayed in the caption. The molecular structure has pseudo-octahedral three-legged piano-stool geometry around the metal center. The triazenide ligand is coordinated to the metal ion through the N(3) and N(5) atoms, forming a four-membered chelate ring, while the pendant 1-methylpyrazol group remains unbound, as a result of the steric hindrance provided by the methyl substituent. This behavior is in contrast to the coordination mode of related triazenide ligands previously reported, where the N-heterocycle coordinates to the metal center [30,31,34–40]. The octahedral distortion in compound 2 is caused primarily by the small-bite angle of the triazenide [N(3)-Ir-N(5)] of 58.61(16)°, whereas the N-Ir-Cl angle is close to the expected 90°. The equivalent NN bond distances of ∼1.32 Å, the Ir-N bond distances of ∼2.10 Å and the near planarity of the chelate ring, show a characteristic π delocalization over the metal-triazenide system [21,68–71]. On the other hand, the distance Ir-CT (CT = centroid) of the Cp* ligand in compound 2 at 1.773 Å is within the range of centroid distances in related IrCp* complexes [21]."
10,Transfer hydrogenation catalysis,"3.3 Transfer hydrogenation catalysis Complex 2 was used as precatalyst (2% mol) in the transfer hydrogenation of aryl and alkyl-ketones to give the corresponding alcohol using either 2-propanol-d 8 or regular 2-propanol as hydrogen source (Table 1 ). All substrates can be hydrogenated in high yields in the absence of base except the acetylpyridine. Acetophenone can be hydrogenated either in the absence or presence of base with 93 and 83% yields in 39 h, respectively (Entries 1 and 2). In contrast, the hydrogenation of acetylpyridine is slow and required the presence of base to be hydrogenated in high yield in just 18 h (>99%, Entry 2). It is assumed that, in the case of acetylpyridine, the catalytic species is the neutral metal hydride, which formation requires the presence of base. Interestingly, no base was needed when alkyl-ketones are the substrates, for example 4-tert-butylcyclohexanone and β-tetralone were hydrogenated in short times of reaction in high yields (98 to >99%, entries 3 and 5). Moreover, in the case of acetophenone and alkyl-ketones, the addition of base slows down the speed of the catalysis (entries 1, 3 and 5). On the other hand, base-free hydrogenation of 4-tert-butylcyclohexanone gives a mixture of diastereomers cis and trans due to the existence of a chiral carbon at position 4 and the generation of a second chiral center after hydrogenation of the pro-chiral carbonyl group (entry 5). The ratio between diastereomers cis and trans is 27 and 73%, respectively (Figs. S32, S33 and S34). In contrast, control experiments using precatalyst 3 lacking of pyrazole gives high yields in the hydrogenation of β-tetralone and 4-tert-butylcyclohexanone. These results are comparable to those observed with precatalyst 2 at the same reaction time (entries 4 and 6). Therefore, the presence of the pendant pyrazole in complex 2 seems not to be relevant for the substrates shown in Table 1. In the reduction of α,β-unsaturated ketones and aldehydes the main drawback of a catalyst operating by inner sphere hydride transfer is that they are often not very selective for CO bonds over CC bonds, presumably due to a competition between CO and CC bonds for the vacant coordination site [50], although it has been reported that hydrogenation of the CC bond will require less energy [72]. In this context, the ability of complex 2 to be a selective precatalyst in the transfer hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated ketones was explored with trans-chalcone, 4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one, methyl acrylate and butyl acrylate (Table 2 ). Indeed, we have found that the base-free hydrogenation of trans-chalcone is very selective and gives the deuterated analogue of either product B or C using complex 2 as precatalyst (Equation 2). An increase of 20 °C, decreased the reaction time considerably maintaining high conversion. Thus, in the absence of base the olefinic bond is preferably hydrogenated in the first place to give product B in 4 to 32 h of reaction time (94 to 95% yield, entries 1, 4, 8 and 9). Once the substrate has been hydrogenated to B, the reduction of the carbonyl group proceeded smoothly to give C in 4 to 7 d (>99%, entries 2 and 5). On the other hand, addition of base slows down the reaction to give the trideuterated analogue of B in 45% yield (entry 3). Interestingly, no traces of product A were detected after performing the reaction either in the presence or the absence of base. In addition, a series of control experiments for the TH of 7b, 7c and 7d were performed in regular 2-propanol, using as precatalyst complexes 2 and 3 (entries 6, 7, 9 and 10). The results showed that both complexes are very selective in the TH of 7b, 7c and 7d to give B in 1 to 6 h. However, yields are higher in the reactions where complex 2 was used as precatalyst. It has been proposed that chemoselective reduction of CC double bond of α,β-unsaturated ketones involves metal hydride complexes and follow a 1,4-addition pathway [62b]. In this case, the TH is a stepwise process with transfer of the hydride to the β-carbon and transfer of the NH proton to the carbonyl oxygen to give the enol species, which will isomerize to the ketone B. Hydrogenation experiments of the α,β-unsaturated ketones 7a-c, carried out under base free conditions in 2-propanol-d 8, gave the addition of two deuterium atoms to the double bond, to form exclusively the product of entries 1, 4 and 8 (Table 1). The level of deuteration in these compounds was examined by 1H NMR and Mass Spectrometry. In the 1H NMR spectrum of the product of entry 4, the integration values for hydrogens at the alpha and beta positions are consistent with the presence of one hydrogen, as well as the presence of three hydrogens at the methyl group (Fig. S54). Moreover, the spectrum of the product in entry 4 showed the molecular ion (M+) at 150.1 atomic mass unit (amu), which is consistent with the molecular formula of C10H10D2O and their expected isotope pattern (Fig. 4 ). Furthermore, the spectrum showed the sequential fragmentation of M+ giving fragments at 135.0, 107.0 and 92.1 amu, from the loss of methyl, carbonyl and methylene (CHD) groups, respectively (Fig. 5 ). The hydrogenation of 5-alken-2-ones (8a-b) was also studied using complexes 2 and 3 as precatalysts in regular 2-propanol at 90 °C (Equation 3). 5-Alken-2-ones having more functional groups amenable to be hydrogenated, more products would be obtained. Therefore, high selectivity is the main challenge in these experiments. Table 3 shows that hydrogenation of 8a with base of 8a at 70 and 90 °C (entries 1 and 3) gave good selectivity toward the carbonyl obtaining 5-hexen-2-ol (A) as the main product, but hexan-2-ol (C), the product of double reduction, was also observed along with unreacted substrate. In the experiments performed without base (KOH) at 70 and 90 °C, a conversion of 98% to hexan-2-one (B) was achieved with only 2% of substrate remaining (entries 2 and 4). An increase of 20 °C made the reaction 20 times faster maintaining the selective hydrogenation to the olefin. The same reaction without catalyst in the presence of KOH gave 12% of B in 39 h (entry 5). The hydrogenation of 8a without precatalyst nor KOH does not proceed, even after 39 h (entry 6). These results provide an easy access to the two products of mono reduction: selective carbonyl hydrogenation when a base is used (entry 3); selective reduction of the olefinic double bond when no base is used (entry 4). Therefore, it is apparent that these reactions need the precatalyst 2 to improve their performance. For comparison purposes, complex 3, with a triazenide ligand without the N-heterocycle was also tested as precatalyst in the same reaction. Interestingly, the results show that complex 3 is not as fast nor selective in the presence of base giving a mixture of products A, B, C and 4-hexen-2-ol, which is an isomer of A (entry 7). However, the hydrogenation of 8a using 3 in the absence of base was faster and required only 1.33 h to give B and C in 76 and 24%, respectively (entry 8). In this reaction, the ratio did not change too much after 6 h giving B and C in 80 and 20%, respectively (entry 9). Interestingly, analysis of the reaction mixture of 8a and 3 after 10 min of heating at 90 °C showed only 9 and 10% of B and C, respectively. On the other hand, hydrogenation of 8b in the presence of base proceeded very slowly (entry 11). However, without base the hydrogenation of 8b is faster and gives a mixture of products B and C at 87 to 13%, respectively (entry 12). A competition experiment followed by 1H NMR (Figs. S91-S95), using acetophenone (9), 5-hexen-2-one (8a) and the cationic metal hydrides 5 and 6, resulted in the isomerization of the double bond from the γ,δ-position to the α,β-position (10) prior to the double bond hydrogenation (Scheme 2 ). Interestingly, metal hydrides 5 and 6 did not react with 8a or 9 at room temperature even after 24 h. However, the 1H NMR spectrum revealed the disappearance of 5 and 6 after heating the mixture for 1. 5 h at 90 °C. Under these reaction conditions, 10 and 11 were the major species along with unreacted 8a and 9. Surprisingly, after addition of 2-propanol only 8a was hydrogenated. These results show that the pyrazole group in the triazenide ligand of complex 2 induces selectivity in the hydrogenation of 5-alken-2-ones, being A the main product in the presence of base, or being B the main product without added base. In contrast, the hydrogenation of 8a is not selective when complex 3 is used as precatalyst in presence of base (entry 7). Comparing the results between an α,β-unsaturated ketones and γ,δ-unsaturated ketones, it was found that at 90 °C both reactions are selective to the reduction of the olefin without base. However, when base is added the reaction is slower for the α,β-unsaturated ketones. In contrast, the reduction of the carbonyl group in γ,δ-unsaturated ketones is favored by addition of base giving A as the main product, which was not observed when the substrate is an α,β-unsaturated ketone."
11,Conclusions,"A precursor of the triazenide ligand functionalized with pirazol and its IrIIICp* complex was synthesized and fully characterized. X-ray diffraction studies confirmed the molecular structures of both ligand and complex. In compound 2 the triazenide binds to the metal through N1 and N3 forming a four member chelate. Reactivity of 2 in 2-propanol allows the formation of a neutral metal hydride (4) and cationic metal hydrides (5 and 6) when base is added. Complexes 2 and 3 were evaluated as precatalysts in the reduction by transfer hydrogenation of aryl-ketones, alkyl-ketones, α,β-unsaturated and γ,δ-unsaturated ketones with good to excellent yields and high selectivity. Reactions carried out in the absence of an external base turned out to be faster, which can be attributed to the ability of the triazenide to be protonated by the solvent giving a cationic metal hydride species with a neutral triazene ligand, which may be deprotonated by the substrate after transferring the hydride and the proton of the NH group. Both complexes (2 and 3) were excellent precatalysts in TH of aryl- and alkyl-ketones; the presence of the pyrazole in complex 2 does not seem to be relevant for these substrates (Table 1). Nevertheless, for the TH of α,β-unsaturated ketones the presence of the pyrazole in the structure of the precatalyst is relevant since higher yields of the product can be obtained. Moreover, there is an improvement in the chemoselectivity when the TH of γ,δ-unsaturated ketones is catalyzed by complex 2, which can be switched from CC to CO bond by addition of base. In conclusion, the introduction of an N-heterocycle as pyrazole in the structure of the ligand improves the selectivity and the reaction rate in the transfer hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated and γ,δ-unsaturated ketones. Further reactivity and theoretical studies along these lines will be necessary to establish the role of the pyrazole."
