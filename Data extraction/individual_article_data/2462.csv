0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2) is the simplest element on the earth and it has the highest energy content per unit mass (141.9MJ/kg) of any other fuel, and has essentially no emissions when electro- chemically converted to electricity in a fuel cell [1]. These are few of the unique features that make H2 the fuel for the future. Hydrogen-based power systems, such as fuel cells, are promising clean energy technologies; however, a significant obstacle is the production and distribution of H2 [2]. Hydrogen is primarily bound into other molecules such as hydrocarbons, and the conversion of a hydrocarbon into hydrogen or synthesis gas (syngas- a mixture of CO and H2) is accomplished through either catalytic or non-catalytic processes [3]. Hydrogen can be produced from fossil fuels by thermochemical processes such as steam-reforming (SR), auto-thermal reforming (ATR) and thermal partial oxidation (TPOX), from water by electrolysis (electricity source can be renewable energy or nuclear energy), from biomass by thermochemical and biological processes, and from ammonia and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) [4]. Almost 98% of the annual production of hydrogen (mainly used in oil refineries, and for ammonia and methanol production) is from the reforming of fossil fuels [5]. An exhaustive review of the H2 production technologies, and H2 storage and purification methods was provided by Holladay et al. [6], while Abbas and Daud [5] reviewed the H2 production techniques by methane decomposition. A recent review by Hassan and Khandelwal [7] has outlined the key H2 reforming technologies with specific focus on aircraft engine application. If the hydrogen source is a hydrocarbon fuel, the immediate product of SR, TPOX and gasification would be syngas. However, in the ATR process, the hydrogen is separated from syngas by water-shift reaction, releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) as the waste product. Syngas has attraction as a fuel for internal combustion engines, gas turbines and high temperature fuel cells, and as a chemical feedstock for the production of ammonia, methanol, higher alcohols, detergents and synthetic hydrocarbon fuels [6,8,9]. Therefore, researchers give individual importance to syngas while dealing with H2 production from hydrocarbon sources. Partial oxidation and auto-thermal reforming processes usually involve a catalyst that enhances conversion, but a catalyst is prone to poisoning and requires great care with the sulfur content of the fuel and with particulates; the catalysts involved are also expensive and prone to damage [2,10]. Furthermore, for most fuels, operating above the upper flammability limit (UFL) is essential to maximize the H2 production; extending the flammability range can be achieved by recirculation of heat and product, use of catalysts or injection of radicals from plasma jets [11]. Thus, the absence of a catalyst necessitates a high reaction temperature [12], which calls for reforming processes that ensure operation above UFL with reactor cores possessing adequate thermophysical characteristics (particularly un-damageable). The superadiabatic combustion (SAC), wherein the combustion takes place above the adiabatic temperature of the reactant mixture, has been well identified as a viable option to realize reactors operating above UFL [13–15]. It is also well known that combustion inside a porous medium (PM) is the widely adopted mechanism to realize SAC by facilitating internal heat recirculation, and hence is one of the most promising non-catalytic thermal partial oxidation (TPOX) techniques for the production of H2 and syngas [1]. The PM could be a fluidized or a stationary bed. In a fluidized bed system, the incoming velocity of the gases is high enough to lift the particles; the spouted-bed combustor introduced by Weinberg et al. [13] is the best example of such a system. Combustion in stationary PM occurs inside the voids of the porous matrix, either by stationary flame combustion or by filtration combustion (FC). The heat exchange between burning gas mixture and the PM permits the heat energy being stored within the solid matrix, causing the flame temperatures to be much higher than the adiabatic temperature. The history and fundamentals of porous medium combustion (PMC), and its diverse applications and research progress are well documented [16–18,19–23,24]. A review by Al-Hamamre and Al-Zoubi [25] examined the hydrogen production in inert porous media (IPM) based reformers by TPOX, with special focus on the rich combustion of hydrocarbon fuels and the conversion of H2S to hydrogen. Following this review, the present article provides a comprehensive survey of the H2 and syngas production technologies by using SAC (with and without using a PM, and non-catalytic and catalytic). In the reminder of this article, Section 2 presents the historical background, and under Section 3, all the researches with hydrocarbon sources are discussed first, followed by H2 production from H2S, hybrid PM-Catalyst reformer, and SAC-based H2 and syngas production from biomass. Separate sections are devoted for typical modeling studies on the topic (Section 4) and development of new reactors to realize SAC without using PM (Section 5). A summary section is also provided with descriptions on the research and development (R&D) challenges ahead (Section 6), followed by the conclusion section."
1,History of SAC-based Hydrogen Production,"According to the established literature, the first attempt to employ SAC for hydrogen production was reported by Weinberg et al. [13] who experimentally proved that stable combustion could be maintained in spouted beds with a fuel-rich mixture having fuel concentration higher than UFL. This could minimize the fraction of fuel used for heat release in any high temperature partial oxidation, pyrolysis, or other reaction in which the remainder of the fuel is to be processed. Thus, combustion of methane/oxygen/nitrogen mixtures at equivalence ratios (φ) of up to 2.34 yielded large proportions of H2 and carbon monoxide (CO), as well as appreciable amounts of higher hydrocarbons. Fig. 1 shows the layout of the proposed spouted bed PM reactor. In a subsequent study, Drayton et al. [14] experimentally proved that the superadiabatic combustion (SAC) temperatures achieved under fuel-rich conditions could facilitate thermal cracking and/or partial oxidation of various hydrocarbons. They fabricated and tested a reciprocal flow burner (RFB) in which the premixed reactants were introduced into alternate ends of a cylindrical reactor containing an inert porous medium (IPM) through periodic switching of the flow direction, as illustrated in Fig. 2 . Accordingly, the excess enthalpy of the combustion products was stored in the IPM, and the periodic switching of the flow direction allowed this stored energy to be used to preheat the incoming reactants. Consequently the gas temperature at the ignition zone of the RFB could significantly exceed the adiabatic temperature of the incoming fuel mixture, and the combustion heat could be recirculated to the reactant gas mixture without being diluted by the product gases. The concept of RFB was also explored by Dobrego et al. [26–28] for H2 production from methane. They presented a comprehensive numerical analysis to address various aspects of RFB that affect the conversion process, such as effect of reactor scale-up and design [28,27], and the effect of addition of steam during the partial oxidation process [26]. It was shown that the residence time (tr ) growth with reactor scale-up was compensated with decrease of maximum temperature (T max). Reactors with reduced aspect ratio were demonstrated to be good for higher productivity. Smaller PM particles (dp =2–3mm) were recommended for lower specific mass flow rates (g =0.5–1kg/m2 s) and vice versa. Porosity variation did not influence the conversion efficiency (ηc ), while reactor insulation thickness had remarkable effect. It was also predicted that by the addition of steam to the working mixture, the H2 concentration in the product gas could be increased by 0.5–1% and ηc by 10–15%, while the optimum φ remained unaffected. It was observed that the overall chemical kinetics model could be combined with detailed gas-phase kinetics model for the investigation of detailed composition of syngas and intermediary components. Further developments will be discussed in the ensuing sections."
2,Further developments,
3,SAC-based H2/syngas production from hydrocarbon fuels,"3.1 SAC-based H2/syngas production from hydrocarbon fuels After the introductory work of Weinberg et al. [13], Kennedy and co-workers [14,29–35,36] were the leading researchers in the use of SAC technology for H2 or syngas production. Kennedy et al. [29] performed numerical and experimental analyses on the chemical structures of FC waves in an IPM for lean and rich methane-air mixtures. It was found that the ultra-rich SAC could convert up to 60% of methane to CO and H2. A 2-temperature numerical model with detailed reaction kinetics was also developed to analyze species profiles and the combustion mechanism of the filtration waves, which was validated with the experimental data. In their continued effort to optimize the H2 production [33], transient FC waves in a matrix of randomly arranged alumina (Al2O3) pellets were studied experimentally for rich and ultra-rich methane/air waves with oxygen enrichment and depletion. It was observed that mixtures with higher oxygen content in the oxidizer stream (φ =2–3) generated higher amounts of syngas. A comparative analysis of lean, rich and ultrarich combustion of methane, ethane and propane was also done experimentally and numerically by Toledo et al. [35,36] for φ =0.2–2.5 and with constant filtration velocity (vf ) of 12cm/s. The ultrarich partial oxidation had achieved SAC, which yielded syngas with ηc =60%, 70%, 55% for methane, ethane and propane. The maximum ηc was nearly 50% for H2 and 80% for CO for all the fuels tested. Few of their studies were focused on producing H2 and syngas from H2S [30–32,34], which will be discussed later in this article. In a similar experiment Gavrilyuk et al. [37] analyzed the effect of material of the discrete PM on the combustion wave temperature. For rich methane–air mixtures, the maximum combustion-wave temperature (Tmax ) was found to be independent of the packing material or the mass flow rate of the gas mixture ( m ̇ f ). Pedersen-Mjaanes [38] studied H2 production by rich combustion of methanol, octane and automotive-grade petrol with different IPMs such as Cordierite foam, alumina foam and alumina beads. Two tubular burners with stainless steel and quartz were constructed for the experiments (Fig. 3 ). The maximum ηc of methanol to hydrogen was 79% with the alumina beads and 74% with the alumina foam. In a similar experiment [1] with the quartz burner, by considering ηc based on lower heating values (LHV), the syngas yield from methanol was up to 56% with the alumina foam and 66% with the alumina bead. However the syngas production was 45% from methane and 36% from octane and petrol. Significant enhancement in UFL was noticed for all the fuels tested, the superior performance being recorded with the alumina beads. The proposed burner was also tested with methane [39], and with different ceramics as the IPM, and the desiccant alumina beads gave the best results. Maximum H2 production was recorded for φ =2.0–2.5 with ηc =55% based on the LHV of the syngas. This work was pursued further [11] to study the extendibility of the UFL, the burner’s response to transients, and the robustness and reliability of the PM and the burners. It was shown that stable combustion of methane, methanol, ethanol, kerosene, biodiesel, octane and petrol at fuel concentrations in excess of the rich flammability limit was possible. The proposed burner was claimed to be suitable as reformer for fuel cell-powered automobiles and petroleum refinery. Fay et al. [40] experimented two identical reactors with different porous structures to reform methane into H2. The porous structures were Yttrium stabilized Zirconia (YZA) reticulated ceramic with 3.9 pores per centimeter (ppc), and packed bed of 3mm diameter Al2O3 pellets. The H2 production and ηc were significantly better for the reticulated ceramic reactor than the packed bed reactor when compared based on interstitial velocity. Also the conversion in the reticulated ceramic reactor was found to be dependent on the material properties. In their subsequent study [41], detailed numerical and experimental characterizations were performed on the reactor with YZA ceramic PM, with φ =1.5–1.5. Fig. 4 shows the experimental setup employed for the study. The aim was to explore the transient nature of the combustion wave for fuel-rich conditions and its influence on ηc . The steam-reforming zone thickness was found increasing with the progress of combustion wave, and ηc was maximum in a thick, high-temperature zone. Pei-yong et al. [42] developed a ceramic PM reactor with a Swiss-roll heat exchanger arranged outside. It was shown that the Swiss-roll structure and the heat storage of PM could increase the reaction temperature to more than 1600K, and realize the SAC with a maximum ηc of 57% at φ =2. Loukou et al. [43] studied stationary TPOX of methane within IPM with SiSiC open foam structure and a packed bed of Al2O3 cylindrical rings, for φ =1.9–2.9. It was shown that the better thermal properties and the higher porosity of siliconized silicon carbide (SiSiC) matrix enabled longer tr for slow reforming reactions to evolve toward equilibrium and yielded syngas with significantly less soot in terms of particle numbers and mass concentration. Very recently, Araya et al. [44] have presented experimental and numerical studies on the effect of steam addition during FC of methane, with the objective of optimizing ηc . It was shown that ηc increased with increase of steam content in the reactant mixture, and the optimum ηc of 98% was observed for a steam content of 39% compared to ηc =49% without steam addition, at φ = 1.8. Dixon et al. [45] reported conversion of liquid heptane to syngas by using IPM reactor with packed bed of alumina pellets; the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 5 . At constant inlet velocity (vm ), H2 production increased with increasing φ, reaching its peak at around φ =3. For a fixed φ, ηc increased with vm , and reached above 80% for vm =80cm/s. Similar trends were observed for CO conversion and energy efficiencies, where peak values exceeded 90% and 80%, respectively. The best range of φ was found to be between 2.5 and 3.5, and the impact of vm on the performance of non-catalytic reforming of heptane was found to be significant (higher vm causes higher Tmax , resulting in higher ηc ). Smith [46] and Smith et al. [47] conducted experiments and numerical modeling to convert ethanol and wet ethanol to syngas via FC. The effects of φ, vm , ηc and water fraction (χ) was investigated; the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 6 . The peak ηc was 48% at φ =4. The conversion efficiency was a weak function of χ, which indicated that wet ethanol is preferable than dry ethanol for syngas production because of the lesser energy required. The H2 to CO ratio increased with increasing ϰ, and the conversion to both H2 and CO increased with increase in vm . A numerical analysis was also performed based on the FC model with detained reaction kinetics and found that the syngas production is a strong function of vm . Furthermore, the effect of preheating on the extension of operating conditions of ceramic burner was studied experimentally and computationally [48]. This study was extended for conversion of butanol and jet fuel (Jet-A) [49–51] to syngas. The peak H2 and CO yields from jet fuel were 42% and 56% respectively, and the respective yields from butanol were 43% and 72%. The H2 yield continued to increase with φ for jet fuel, and both H2 and CO yields reached peaks within the tested operating range. The results were validated with equilibrium calculations and also with previous results for methane and n-heptane. Rai et al. [52] reported inserting a ceramic honey comb structure as IPM inside a tubular liquid fuel reformer for the TPOX of methanol. The best performance of the reformer was achieved at φ =3.5. An interesting attempt to produce Syngas from diesel by TPOX was reported by Al-Hamamre et al. [8]. Equilibrium and kinetic calculations were performed to determine the main influence parameters on the TPOX. Subsequently, a high-temperature residual free diesel-air mixture was prepared, and the effect of the preheating temperature and the excess air ratio on the evaporation process was investigated experimentally. In the reforming part, a ZrO2 porous foam-based reformer was used to perform the TPOX, and the performance of the evaporator was then assessed with respect to the case without PM. The experimental PM-based diesel reformer is shown in Fig. 7 . Their subsequent work [53] was focused on numerical and experimental studies on the effects of air preheating temperature (Tap ), thermal load and φ on the TPOX and found that φ =2.5 was a practical limit for TPOX, and Tap had no significant influence on the syngas composition. They also conducted experiments with SiC foam and Al2O3 – static mixer (Fig. 8 ) and showed that the performance of SiC foam was relatively better in terms of heat recuperation and soot point. Dmitrenko et al. [54] studied the influence of composition and specific flow rate of methane-air mixture (g) on Tmax in the filtration-combustion wave, the wave propagation velocity (vwp ) and the composition of the reaction products. The maximum concentrations of H2 and CO in the product were 25% and 16% respectively and the maximum ηc was 63%, while the minimum concentration of residual methane in the reaction products was 3% in the optimum conversion regimes. Tmax was found to be crucial for ηc , as also noticed by Dhamrat and Ellzey [41]. Increase in g and decrease in φ had increased Tmax , thereby improving ηc ; however the influence of g on Tmax was remarkable only up to 0.7kg/m2 s, while the minimum limit for φ was observed to be 2.8. Pastore and Mastorakos [55,56] developed two layer PM burners for the conversion of diesel, kerosene and biodiesel (rapeseed-oil methyl ester) to syngas. n-heptane was reformed up to φ =3, with ηc (based on the LHV of H2 and CO over the fuel input) up to 75% for a packed bed of alumina beads. Similarly, diesel, kerosene and bio-diesel were reformed in a zirconia foam burner with ηc over 60%. The effects of PM, thermal load and φ were also studied for these fuels. The experimental setup employed for the study is shown schematically in Fig. 9 , and the developed burners are shown in Fig. 10 . In a promising development in the reforming of long-chain hydrocarbons particularly in mesoscale, Thompson et al. [12] proposed a reactor by incorporating the heat recirculation concept and PMC. Based on the chemical equilibrium calculations for n-heptane, they developed an experimental reactor (9.3in. long and with 4.6in. diameter), which comprised preheated air, convective and conductive annular heat transfer facility, twin- fluid injectors, and non-catalytic PMC, as illustrated in Fig. 11 . The preheated fuel-air mixture passes through the annular region resulting in additional preheating and vaporization of the liquid fuel prior to entering the innermost PMC region wherein the flame is stabilized, allowing for higher burning speeds and thus realizing SAC. The preliminary experimental results by using methane showed stable combustion at φ =3, and their subsequent study [57] was focused on the design features and detailed characterization of the system by numerical simulation with the aid of Chemkin and Fluent programs. Further experiments with fuels such as diesel, biodiesel, soybean oil and glycerol are reportedly in progress. The concept of RFB proposed by Drayton et al. [14] was pursued by Dmitrenko and Klevan [58] to determine the optimal operating conditions of syngas production from methane by experimental investigation of the influence of the g and φ on the temperature in the reversible flow reactor and the composition of conversion products. The concentration of H2 was maximum for φ =2.8 and g =1.8kg/(m2 s). In a subsequent experiment [59] on the reversible flow reactor, the impact of operating pressure in the reactor (PR ) on Tmax and the composition of reaction products was studied. It was shown that for a given value of g, ηc decreased with increase in PR . In a similar study [60], the effect of volume concentration of oxygen in the initial fuel mixture on the same parameters was investigated and found that the addition of oxygen to the initial mixture caused to increase ηc . By using the experimental data of this reactor, Alabbadi et al. [61] have shown that the chemical processes in the IPM of the reactor could be modeled with good accuracy by the standard kinetic scheme for homogeneous processes. A latest work by Toledo et al. [62] has conducted experiments for production of syngas from liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), butane, propane, diesel fuel and heavy fuel oil (HFO) in PM reactor containing fixed bed of Al2O3 spheres. The study has demonstrated the promising potential of syngas production from liquid fuels by PMC. As an interesting breakthrough, Toledo and co-researchers [63–67] have proposed the concept of hybrid filtration combustion (HFC), wherein gaseous and solid fuels are simultaneously converted to H2 or syngas. In their experimental reactor as shown in Fig. 12 [63], the PM was composed of aleatory wood pellets (acted as solid fuel) and Al2O3 spheres, and the gaseous fuel was butane. Temperature, velocity, and combustion products were recorded experimentally for φ =1.0–2.6. Hydrogen and CO were the dominant products of the HFC of butane and wood pellets, and the Syngas yield was found to be essentially higher than that for butane FC in an IPM. This experiment was pursued further with natural gas and coal [64] for a range of volume coal fractions from 0% to 75% at φ =2.3, and a filtration velocity (vf ) of 15cm/s. The results were consistent with those obtained in the wood-butane case; the maximum ηc for the HFC was about 55% for a volumetric coal content of 75%. Later on [67], detailed empirical studies were conducted on the same setup to assess the effect of addition of steam on the syngas yield. Similar experiment was conducted [66] with propane, aleatory polyethylene pellets and alumina spheres, for φ =1.0–1.65. A numerical model with GRI 3.0 reaction mechanism was also applied for the HFC, and the predictions were in agreement with the experimental data. The maximum H2 and CO yields were close to 48% and 89%, respectively. In another study [65], the HFC was studied for lean combustion of methane in bed of aleatory alumina spheres and wood pellets. The maximum ηc was found to be about 99% at φ =0.3, and HFC was proved to be feasible for reforming solid fuels into H2 and syngas. A detailed insight into the HFC mechanism is provided by Torres and Huerta [68]."
4,SAC-based H2 production from H2S,"3.2 SAC-based H2 production from H2S H2S is a main byproduct during the processing of fossil fuels such as natural gas, petroleum and coal. Even though the conventional processes of decomposition of H2S produce elemental sulfur (S2), a significant amount H2 present is lost as water vapor; the SAC technology greatly contributes to minimizing this loss besides eliminating the sulfur recovery catalyst and the associated cost and environmental threat [15]. Therefore, as the proven technique to realize SAC, PMC has attracted researchers in the recovery of H2 from H2S. Liming and Shudong [69] discussed the characteristics and mechanism of SAC in PM, and summarized the advances in the H2S superadiabatic decomposition. A thermodynamic analysis of the process was carried out and its advantages over the conventional process were also highlighted. The Gas Technology Institute (GIT) at Illinois, in collaboration with the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and other industrial partners, has been active in developing novel techniques for the non-catalytic thermal decomposition of H2S [70,31]. As part of this venture, Kennedy and co-workers [30–32,34] of UIC have developed PMC based SAC reactor for H2S decomposition and proved that by using an H2S-rich stream as both the fuel and hydrogen source, the high SAC flame temperature promotes rapid thermal decomposition of most of the H2S to H2 and S2. The conceptual layout of the proposed SAC process is shown in Fig. 13 , and the lab-scale reactor developed for the study is shown in Fig. 14 . They made a comparative study on the FC waves formed in an IPM by methane and H2S, with a range of φ from 1 to 2.5 and 1 to 5.5 respectively [30]. For both methane and H2S combustion, upstream (underadiabatic) propagation corresponded to φ from 1 to 1.7, and downstream (superadiabatic) wave propagation was observed for ultrarich (φ ⩾1.7) mixtures. Up to 60% of the methane was converted to syngas while 20% of H2S was converted to hydrogen. The experimental setup used for the study is shown in Fig. 15 , which employed a packed bed of alumina as PM. Another experiment [32] on the same setup to analyze lean and rich H2S–air mixtures (ϕ =0.1–5.5) also yielded similar results. A thermodynamic model was also developed [34] to assess the product compositions attainable in the superadiabatic zone. The H2S and O2 feed compositions were varied (20–100% and 21–100%, respectively), with φ =2–16, in order to optimize the hydrogen yield. The predictions confirmed favorable H2 and low SO2 yields in the ultra-rich (φ =6–12) superadiabatic zone, whereas pure oxygen operation had shifted the optimum thermodynamic range to φ >12. With O2, high H2 and low SO2 yields were predicted in the superadiabatic systems with lower degrees of heat recuperation."
5,H2/Syngas Production by Hybrid PM-Catalyst Reforming,"3.3 H2/Syngas Production by Hybrid PM-Catalyst Reforming A recent study [71] has focused on incorporating PM upstream and downstream of a catalytic-packed bed for the dry autothermal reforming (DATR) of methane. In the DATR process, part of the chemical energy released from the reaction supplies the energy required for a self-sustaining reaction. The schematic of the proposed technique is shown in Fig. 16 , wherein the upstream PM is the preheating zone (OBSiC foam) while the PM downstream (alumina foam) stores thermal energy and supports the catalyst bed (Pt-Ru coated alumina spheres). The flame stabilization at the interface of the PM and the catalyst bed could enhance the fuel conversion and reforming efficiencies, particularly in the low methane conversion condition. It was shown that the reforming reaction with the hybrid reformer could achieve excess enthalpy under the tested parameters. The energy loss percentage was between 12.7% and 24.6%, while the reforming efficiency was between 64.4% and 79.5%. It was also deduced that upstream PM could be used as a built-in heat exchanger. Another version of the PM-catalyst technique for DATR, is the short contact type catalytic partial oxidation technique (SCT-CPO), which was conceptualized in 1992 and is currently at the level of industrial development for the production of syngas and olefins [72]. The SCT-CPO technology incorporates the features of heterogeneous catalysis and PMC, and the reforming is not dry. However, the SCT-CPO reactors need to be operated at high pressures (1.5–3.0MPa), and the catalytic processes occur at significantly lower residence times compared to other catalytic reactions and faster than those of the free flame reactions [72]. Basini and Guarinoni [72] have elaborated the ongoing development in SCT-CPO for syngas production from hydrocarbon fuels, and the similarities and differences between SCT-CPO and PM combustors. The results from the bench scale experiments were utilized for developing an industrial SCT-CPO reactor, which is likely to be installed in parallel to an existing steam reforming reactor [72]. Use of catalytic PM for H2 was also reported in a subsequent study [73], which has employed SiC porous matrix coated with La – Sr- Fe- Cr- Ru based perovskite catalyst in various compositions. The flammability limits of the combustion of methane and air were explored using both inert and catalytically enhanced surfaces of the ceramic PM. It was found that the catalyst coating could lower the minimum stable φ and improve the combustion efficiency."
6,H2/syngas production form biomass by PMC,"3.4 H2/syngas production form biomass by PMC The use of PMC for H2 and syngas production was reported by Yang and co-workers [74,75] who established that the PM as bed material in the fluidized bed reactor enhances the gas production rate, decreases tar, and promotes degradation of hydrocarbons for gasification. In the experiments, agricultural waste (corn stalk) was air-dried and milled to particle sizes of 0.83–1.65mm. The porous bed material was mixed with silica gel, zeolite and activated alumina to act as a catalytic PM, with particle size ranging from 0.35mm to 0.5mm. Compared with industrial sand as bed material, the PM was more efficient for gasifying biomass to hydrogen-rich gas; this was attributed to the secondary cracking of heavy hydrocarbons due to enhanced heat transfer within the PM. The product yields of hydrogen-rich gas increased with increasing gasification temperature. In a latest development, the HFC technique has been employed for syngas production from residual biomass of forestry and cereal plantations [76]. The biomass pellets made from oat cane, wheat cane, shining gum (Eucalyptus nitens) and insignis pine (Pinus radiata), and Al2O3 spheres formed the solid bed. Experiments were conducted with natural gas–air mixture at φ = 1.1 and also with addition of steam. By using natural gas–air mixture alone, the usage of cereal plantation residuals enhanced syngas production and maximum ηc was achieved with wheat cane. The presence of steam was found to be unfavorable for syngas production in most cases. Though beyond the scope of this article, the recent studies [77,78] on the application of PMC for the cleaning of syngas produced by biomass gasification is worth mentioning. The cleaning of syngas is one of the challenges in the biomass gasification technology [78]. In the proposed methodology, the feasibility of destruction of tar present in syngas was tested experimentally as well as by means of a chemical kinetics model. Toluene was considered as the tar surrogate in the chemical model, and the experiments were performed in a PM burner with pure methane and syngas and with toluene concentration in the syngas varying from 50 to 200g/Nm3. The results revealed that toluene was almost completely destroyed for all tested conditions without affecting the performance of the porous burner."
7,Modeling of H2/syngas production by SAC,"The basic modeling approach for H2/Syngas production by SAC is similar to that of the general PMC modeling (one remarkable exception is that the oxidation is partial with rich or ultrarich mixture), and a comprehensive account of the various modeling approaches is available in the author’s previous work [23]. In addition to the numerical works cited in the preceding sections, few exemplary works on this context are described here. Shabunya et al. [79] stressed the significance of a heterogeneous model for realistic prediction of chemical processes in the decomposition of methane by FC. Guoneng et al. [80] employed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in conjunction with CHEMKIN to model the combustion of H2S in discrete PM of Al2O3 spheres. The standard k–ε turbulence model and a 17-species, 57-elemental reaction mechanism were used in numerical simulation. The numerical results showed good agreement with the experimental data. The SAC phenomenon was demonstrated and the production of H2 and S2 at fuel-rich condition was verified. The proposed CFD model with complex chemical reaction mechanism was proved to be well in modeling the anisotropic flame of H2S in porous media. In their extended studies [81,82], this model was successfully applied for H2 and Syngas production from methane. A thermodynamic numerical model based on Reynold’s Gibbs free energy minimization using the Stanjan computation subroutine was employed by Slimane et al. [34] for the superadiabatic POX of H2S. Pereira et al. [83] performed numerical simulations of methane TPOX within IPM and validated with experiments. The validity of using a quasi-1D approach was explored based on 3D simulations of the isothermal fluid flow through the porous solid structure. Several fluid flow cases were taken into account with two different porous materials (Al2O3 fiber lamellae and SiSiC foam). The detailed fluid flow information obtained from the 3D study was used to provide the realistic cross-sectional area variation of the quasi-1D model. The quasi-1D 12-steps reduced chemistry model predictions were in very satisfactory agreement with the experimental data. The computational domain of the PM reactor model is shown in Fig. 17 . Futko [84] had presented model for low velocity FC methane, and a detailed kinetic analysis of the heat-release structure, dynamics of radical formation and conversion processes under ultra-rich conditions. Li et al. [85] presented a CFD model combined with detailed chemical kinetics for the SAC of methane in a packed bed of alumina spherical particles inside a Swiss-role reactor; the computational domain of the reactor is shown in Fig. 18 . The oxidation model used 17 species and 58 elemental reactions, and the numerical results were validated by experimental data. A 2-temperature numerical model with detailed chemical mechanism for the RFB with an external heat source in the middle section was developed by Zheng et al. [86], to study the effect of the variation of the power of the external heat source on the syngas yield from methane. It was found that syngas production increased significantly with the addition of the external heat source, reaching to a maximum of 97%. Kostenko et al. [87] employed a 2-temperature model for conversion of methane/oxygen/steam mixture within IPM. The reaction kinetics model included a set of gas-phase radical-chain reactions supplemented with the loss of radicals on the surface of inert solid, formation of soot and reactions of the latter with oxygen, water and CO2. The model employed by Thompson and Agrawal [57] for the simulation of their experimental reactor by the combined Chemkin-Fluent platform would be promising for small scale and portable systems, which could be extended for a variety of hydrocarbon fuels. Mendes et al. [88] presented a 2-temperature model with detailed reaction kinetics for the TPOX of methane within a small scale IPM based reactor for maximizing ηc and minimizing the soot formation. The results showed that the optimal φ is a compromise between ηc and soot formation. It was also found that the IPM length and water addition could improve the performance of the reactor. The modeling approach for the HFC is detailed in [68]."
8,Non-catalytic SAC reactor without PM,"Ellzey and co-workers [2,3,10,89,90] have developed novel mesoscale reactors to realize SAC without the use a of PM. Unlike the moving combustion waves in FC, the proposed counterflow reactor offers stationary combustion wave with simplified geometry. Stabilization of SAC zones through internal heat circulation mechanism within the counterflow reactor is illustrated in Fig. 19 a), while Fig. 19b) illustrates the prototype reactor. The heat recirculation between channels with opposing flow directions was shown to achieve reactions beyond the UFL. Experiments with methane [10], propane [3] and heptane [2] showed occurrence of stable reaction fronts at a wide range of φ and vm . With methane, the stationary combustion fronts were obtained at φ =1.8–2.5. For constant φ, operation was possible for a wide range of firing rates, which was equivalent to a large turn-down ratio. In addition, increased reaction rates due to SAC resulted in a high power density of the reactor. For propane, SAC was sustained for φ =2.2–2.9 and vm =37.5–125cm/s; the corresponding ranges for heptane were φ =2.8–3.9 and vm =50–200cm/s. A 2-dimensional numerical model with detailed reaction kinetics (GRI 2.11) was developed [90] to study the reaction zone characteristics with methane as fuel. This reactor was claimed to be promising for portable power supply applications. However it is worth noting that, the peak ηc was significantly lower than that attained via FC in PM, and this discrepancy was attributed to the higher Tmax obtainable in the PM reactors owing to their higher specific surface area for heat transfer compared to the proposed counterflow reactor. The concept of Swiss-role heat-recirculating reactor has also been proved to be promising in achieving SAC with the use of neither a PM nor a catalyst. Such a reactor was recently experimented by Chen et al. [91] for syngas production. In this reformer, the reactants are preheated by the POX products resulting in SAC, yielding syngas without requiring an external heat source. The proposed Swiss-roll combustor was compact and thermally efficient due to the high effectiveness of the spiral heat exchanger. The mechanism of the reforming process the reactor is shown in Fig. 20 . The fuel flexibility was tested with propane, n-heptane and JP- 8, and similar results were obtained for the same φ, with no visible soot formation."
9,Challenges ahead,"Table 1 summarizes the published literature to date, on the researches on H2 and Syngas production by SAC. It is very obvious that a lot of research has been carried out on the exploitation of SAC technique for the conversion of hydrocarbon and other fuels into H2 and syngas. However there is a wide scope for further work, and few of the numerous areas are roughly grouped and described as follows: • Characterization: detailed characterization is required for all the reported reactors with the objective of maximizing the conversion efficiency. While the effect of equivalence ratio is well established, the effects of porous material and structure, and reactor geometry and size need further investigation for developing SAC reactors for suitable for various stationary and portable applications. • Fuel diversity: methane, being the most abundant source of H2, is the most tested fuel, followed by butane, propane, ethanol, methanol, etc. The fuels such as diesel, biodiesel, soybean oil, glycerol etc., and more importantly biomass, need extensive study. • Development of reactors: most of the reported reactors are laboratory level, so further researches should focus on developing practical reactors for diverse applications. For instance, by considering the risk of hydrogen storage, onsite reforming reactors are attractive; therefore, the works on mesoscale portable systems need to be pursued further. On the other hand, biomass-based studies should be extended to develop large-scale systems. Scope is also wide for developing reactors based on reversible flow, HFC, DATR, counterflow heat-exchanger without PM and the Swiss-roll concept (with and without PM). • Economic and environmental assessment: The major part of the global H2 production is by reforming of fossil fuels, for which the main challenge is CO2 capture and storage [92]. Economic feasibility is another issue in commercializing most of the conversion techniques. Therefore any effort toward developing new SAC based reactor should include process and system optimization based on techno-economic analysis, life cycle costing (LCC) and life cycle assessment (LCA). • Modeling: Modeling remains an ongoing challenge. For realistic predictions, more studies should be done on developing 2-temperature multidimensional models with detailed reaction kinetics for the various rectors reported."
10,Conclusion,"A comprehensive and updated review of the researches reported on the SAC-based hydrogen/syngas production is presented. At present the most effective method of H2 production is conversion of the hydrocarbon sources. The energy efficiency of TPOX is higher and practically independent of the power of the reactor as opposed to SR. TPOX does not need external heat sources and additional fluids such as water, and does not require a catalyst. It has a good dynamic response time and can handle both light and heavy fuels. Therefore, small-scale TPOX systems are receiving much interest for both stationary and portable applications. However the main drawbacks of TPOX systems include soot formation under fuel rich conditions, the slow kinetics and the decreased flame stability at low adiabatic flame temperatures. These issues could be effectively tackled by performing TPOX in IPM, which offers flame speeds 20times higher than the laminar flame speed. The internal heat circulation facilitates preheating of the reactants, resulting in SAC. By considering the risks associated with the storage and transportation of hydrogen, onsite production is receiving more attention. The advantage of SAC has been realized even in reactors without PM, such as the counterflow reactor and Swiss-roll reactor. Even though there are diverse kinds of techniques being explored for hydrogen production, the thermal reforming of methane and other fossil fuels will continue despite the CO2 capture and storage threat, until alternative clean technologies are popularized. Therefore as a matured technique to combat CO2 and NOx emissions, the PMC based systems have prominence for the TPOX of fossil fuels for H2 and syngas production. Moreover the SAC systems eliminate the costly and poisonous catalysts. With regard to the H2S decomposition and biomass gasification, this technology has demonstrated excellent performance. The recent works on HFC for conversion of solid biomass to hydrogen and syngas opens doors for new researches and development of novel reactors. However, the research needs a long way to go before materializing SAC based systems (with and without PM, and with and without catalyst) for practical applications."
