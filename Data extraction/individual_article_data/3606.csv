0,Introduction,"Hydrogen can combine with oxygen in fuel cells to produce electricity and water (Hoffmann, 2001). Before hydrogen can become a large scale replacement for other fuels, however, it must be renewably produced. Anaerobic fermentation processes to produce hydrogen have been extensively studied over the last decade (Hawkes et al., 2002) and show promise for renewable hydrogen production. Key challenges remaining are the long-term operation of fermentation processes and the identification of appropriate substrates for hydrogen production. Almost any natural source of microorganisms can yield hydrogen-producing bacteria. Examples of inoculum sources include sewage sludge drying beds (Chen et al., 2002), sludge composters (Ueno et al., 1996), soils (Van Ginkel et al., 2005), secondary clarifier sludge (Yu et al., 2002), and mesophilic anaerobic digester sludge (Horiuchi et al., 2002). Typically, researchers remove hydrogen-consuming methanogenic organisms in the inoculum source with heat shock treatments, pasteurization or boiling (Cohen et al., 1985; Lay, 2000; Logan et al., 2002) although heat treatment may also decrease the inherent hydrogen production capability (Zhu and Béland, 2006). Successful hydrogen production can also be achieved with non-heat treatment inocula by adjusting the pH and solids retention time (Kraemer and Bagley, 2005), aerating, or adding a specific methanogenic inhibitor such as 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid (Zhu and Béland, 2006), but a long-term challenge arises from hydrogen-consuming organisms, in particular methanogenic organisms, that may live in reactor biofilms (Shizas and Bagley, 2005). By applying continuous heat treatment to a sidestream from a continuous hydrogen-producing reactor, Khanal et al. (2006) minimized methanogenic activity in a system fed soluble substrate. If, however, the substrate to be treated, such as primary sludge or municipal wastewater, includes hydrogen-consuming microorganisms, the reactor system will be continuously recolonized. Ongoing heat treatment as proposed by Khanal et al. (2006) may prove impractical and economically infeasible. Bioaugmentation of a hydrogen-producing reactor with a known hydrogen-producing culture may be one method to specifically address the long-term operational challenge posed by the growth of hydrogen-consuming organisms. To be successful, however, bioaugmentation requires an inexpensive, readily available inoculum that can be continuously added. Anaerobically digested municipal wastewater sludge is readily available from many municipal wastewater treatment plants and could serve, with appropriate pre-treatment, as an inoculum source for bioaugmentation. Pelletization of anaerobically digested municipal wastewater sludge produces biosolids pellets that can be beneficially used as part of a solids management plan (Jacques Whitford Ltd., 2004). During pelletization, dewatered digester sludge is subjected to 110–115°C for at least 75min total, increasing the solids concentration from 25% to 30% total solids to over 90% total solids and producing pellets that are approximately 3 mm in diameter (Jacques Whitford Ltd., 2004). These conditions exceed those typically used to prepare hydrogen-producing inoculum by heat treatment. Therefore, the pellets could serve as an inexpensive and renewable inoculum source for fermentative hydrogen-producing reactors, if the pellets are indeed able to support fermentative hydrogen production. Carbohydrates are considered the most suitable substrates for hydrogen-producing fermentations (Hawkes et al., 2002). Glucose and sucrose have been extensively evaluated for their hydrogen production potential (Mizuno et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2001; Fang and Lui, 2002). Other substrates that have also been examined include municipal solid waste (Lay et al., 1999), bean curd wastes (Noike et al., 2002), rice winery wastewater (Yu et al., 2002), and numerous high strength wastewaters including food processing wastewaters (Van Ginkel et al., 2005). Fewer studies have been conducted with municipal wastewater sludges (Ting et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2003) but these studies looked at either waste activated sludge or mixed sludge, not primary sludge. One study has been conducted with domestic wastewater (Van Ginkel et al., 2005). Primary sludge and municipal wastewater merit further examination as possible substrates for fermentative hydrogen production. The primary objective of this work was to test the fermentative hydrogen-producing capability of biosolids pellets which could serve as an inexpensive seed for ongoing bioaugmentation. Biosolids pellets were compared to boiled anaerobic digester sludge and to untreated anaerobic digester sludge. A secondary objective was to compare the hydrogen-producing capacity of two substrates that have not been well studied but are widely prevalent: primary sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment facility and municipal wastewater. Glucose was used as a control substrate."
1,Methods,
2,Inoculum sources,"2.1 Inoculum sources Three inocula were tested in this study: untreated anaerobic digester sludge from a mesophilic sludge digester (untreated sludge), boiled anaerobic digester sludge from a mesophilic sludge digester (boiled sludge) and biosolids pellets. Mesophilic anaerobic digester sludge was obtained from the primary digesters at the North Toronto Wastewater Treatment Plant (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) and used for both the untreated sludge and boiled sludge inocula. The boiled sludge was boiled at 100°C for 30min. Biosolids pellets were obtained from Ashbridges Bay Wastewater Treatment Facility (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). At the Ashbridges Bay facility, the biosolids pellets were prepared from a combination of primary and waste activated sludge that had been anaerobically digested at 35°C. After centrifuge dewatering to 25–30% total solids, a Keppel Seghers HARDPelletiser dried the centrifuge cake at 110–115°C to greater than 90% total solids containing 3–5% iron and 1.5% cationic polyelectrolyte polymer (Jacques Whitford Ltd., 2004; Wlodarczyk, 2003). The total and volatile solids of the three inocula are presented in Table 1 ."
3,Characteristics of the substrates,"2.2 Characteristics of the substrates Unsettled municipal wastewater was obtained from the inlet of the North Toronto Wastewater Treatment Plant (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Primary sludge was obtained from the outlet of the primary settling tank of the same plant. Prior to using, the wastewater and the primary sludge were dried at 105°C over night. The dry residues were used to prepare feed solutions having a total chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration of about 1000mg/L. A glucose solution with a COD concentration of about 1000mg/L was prepared using USP Grade glucose purchased from Caledon Laboratories (Georgetown, ON, Canada). Nutrients were added to the glucose solution according to Kraemer and Bagley (2005) with the amount of each nutrient scaled to the COD concentration of the solution. The characteristics of the three substrates are summarized in Table 2 ."
4,Experimental set-up and operation,"2.3 Experimental set-up and operation The study was conducted using batch tests in 160-mL serum bottles. Bottles were inoculated with 50mg of volatile solids from one of the three inocula. The biosolids pellets were ground in a lab mortar and sieved (ASTM Standard Test-Sieve, No. 25, 710 micron) prior to inoculation. Bottles then received either 100mL of one of the substrates described in Table 2 (to provide approximately 100mg total COD) or 100mL of nutrient solution (used to prepare the glucose feed solution). After inoculation each bottle was sparged for 5min with 0.1L/min of 90% N2/10% CO2 (Praxair, Mississauga, ON, Canada) and then closed with a 20 mm teflon-lined silicone septum and aluminum crimp cap. The bottles were incubated at 35±1°C in a water bath (StableTemp 12-L analog, Oakton Instruments, Vernon Hills, IL). The bottles were shaken daily just before taking headspace gas sample for analysis but were otherwise unmixed. No extra buffer was added to the bottles during the test and pH was not controlled in the bottles. Three series of batch tests were conducted. In the first series, all bottles, except the controls, received the glucose feed. Triplicate bottles were prepared for each glucose-fed bottle with one un-fed control per inoculum source. In the second series, primary sludge was the test substrate, with glucose also examined for comparison. Duplicate bottles were prepared for biosolids pellets and boiled sludge for both primary sludge and glucose, and duplicate bottles were prepared for untreated sludge receiving primary sludge. Un-fed control bottles were prepared for biosolids pellets and boiled sludge (one each). The third series was set up identically to the second series with municipal wastewater used in place of primary sludge."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Total gas production was determined periodically throughout each experiment by measuring the gas pressure in the bottle headspaces using a digital pressure gauge (Cole–Parmer, Concord, ON, Canada). The headspace gas composition (H2, CH4, and CO2) was measured periodically throughout each experiment by taking a 50-μL aliquot with a 100-μl SampleLock™ gas-tight syringe (Hamilton Co., Reno, NV) and analyzing by gas chromatography using the method of Kraemer and Bagley (2005). The volatile fatty acids (VFA) formic, acetic, lactic, propionic, butyric and valeric acids were measured by ion chromatography. At the end of each series of tests, 20mL samples were filtered through Whatman GF/C filters, and diluted with deionized water. Aliquots (3-mL) of these samples were then prepared and analyzed as described by Kraemer and Bagley (2005). All pH measurements were conducted with a desktop pH meter (model 8015, VWR International) with automatic temperature correction. Total COD, soluble COD, TS, VS, TSS, and VSS were measured according to Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater (American Public Health Association, 1998). Soluble COD and suspended solids samples were filtered using Whatman 934-AH glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/C, VWR International, Mississauga, ON, Canada)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Capability of pellets to produce hydrogen from glucose,"3.1 Capability of pellets to produce hydrogen from glucose Biosolids pellets produced the same quantity of hydrogen from glucose as did boiled anaerobic digester sludge (Fig. 1 ) although the biosolids pellets showed a 20h lag to reach full hydrogen production versus boiled sludge. The maximum average H2 recoveries (determined at the maximum H2 production in Fig. 1) ranged from 20.2% to 21.5% (Table 3 ) and were not significantly different (95% confidence) between the different inocula. This fits well within the ranges observed by other researchers of 11.9–22.5% (Mizuno et al., 2000; Yokoi et al., 2002) and is below the theoretical maximum of 33% that would occur if each mole of glucose could be fermented to two moles of acetate, two moles of CO2 and four moles of H2. Little hydrogen consumption was observed in the biosolids pellets bottles after reaching maximum hydrogen production, unlike boiled sludge which showed significant hydrogen consumption after reaching maximum production. Methane production was not detected in either the biosolids pellets bottles or the boiled sludge bottles (data not shown). The untreated sludge showed a spike of hydrogen (Fig. 1) that was then consumed to produce methane. Hydrogen production was not detected in the un-fed control bottles. The soluble COD removal from the biosolids pellets and boiled sludge bottles averaged 18.1% and 14.4%, respectively (Table 3). The soluble COD removal in the biosolids pellets bottles agreed well with the remaining hydrogen COD which accounted for 18.1% of the added COD. In the boiled sludge bottles the mass balance on COD did not close as well – the remaining hydrogen COD accounted for only 5.8% of the added COD providing an overall balance of 91.4%. While the boiled sludge bottles showed higher final soluble COD compared to the biosolids pellets, as expected to account for hydrogen consumption, this did not account completely for the hydrogen COD consumed. This discrepancy may have been due to hydrogen COD that became associated with the biomass in one form or another as the hydrogen was consumed and thus was not measured as soluble COD. Acetate and butyrate were the principal volatile fatty acids measured (Table 3). Lactate and propionate were either not detected or below 1% of the total COD added. The sum of acetate and butyrate COD accounted for 72–73% of the remaining soluble COD. Alcohols were not measured in this study and may account for a fraction of the remaining soluble COD. Additionally, as observed by Khanal et al. (2006), other unidentified soluble constituents may have also formed."
8,Hydrogen production from primary sludge and municipal wastewater,"3.2 Hydrogen production from primary sludge and municipal wastewater Boiled sludge produced more hydrogen from primary sludge than biosolids pellets, although the results between bottles were highly variable (Fig. 2 ). The glucose-fed controls for both boiled sludge and biosolids pellets performed similarly to Fig. 1, both in terms of hydrogen production and variability, but showed less hydrogen consumption after reaching maximum production (data not shown). No hydrogen production was detected in the un-fed controls. The H2 recovery from primary sludge was 5.8–9.0 times lower than the recovery from glucose (Table 3). The recovery difference between the biosolids pellets and the boiled sludge may be due to increased solubilization of the primary sludge in the boiled sludge bottles. Only 5.2% of the added primary sludge COD was soluble while the final soluble COD in the boiled sludge bottles was 23% of the added substrate COD, compared to only 12.1% in the biosolids pellets bottles. The ratio of final soluble COD is 0.52 (biosolids pellets/boiled sludge) while the ratio of H2 recoveries is 0.69. The possibility exists that the boiled sludge inoculum introduced unaccounted soluble COD, but this would have been less than 3.7% of the added COD based on the glucose-fed results (Table 3). Therefore, while apparently less capable of solubilizing primary sludge, the biosolids pellets may have produced equal or more hydrogen per gram of COD solubilized than the boiled sludge. Boiled sludge produced more hydrogen from municipal wastewater than biosolids pellets, but in both cases the amount of hydrogen produced was below the hydrogen produced from primary sludge and glucose (Fig. 3 , Table 3). Produced hydrogen was consumed in both cultures as well (Fig. 3). The maximum H2 recoveries were 4.4–12.0 times lower than the recoveries from primary sludge and 25–108 times lower than the recoveries from glucose. Although the initial soluble COD in the municipal wastewater systems was significantly greater than in the primary sludge systems (Table 2), this material was apparently recalcitrant to hydrogen fermentation. The solubilization of COD from municipal wastewater was greater than that observed for primary sludge and consistent in showing greater solubilization in the boiled sludge bottles than in the biosolids pellets bottles. Similar to the initial soluble COD, however, the COD solubilized during the experiment was also apparently recalcitrant to hydrogen fermentation. The expected initial pH values for the bottles were between 4.4 and 7.9 for the glucose-fed bottles, 5.5 and 7.4 for the primary sludge-fed bottles and 6.4 and 9.1 for the municipal wastewater-fed bottles (the lower number represents the pH calculated for the bottles in equilibrium with the CO2 in the sparging gas during set up and the higher number is from Table 2). The final pH values (Table 3) are consistent with the expected initial pH values and the VFA production from each substrate. pH values lower than 6 are typically used for hydrogen production to minimize methanogenic hydrogen consumption but methane production was not observed with either biosolids pellets or boiled sludge. Nevertheless, the higher pH values in primary sludge and municipal wastewater may have decreased the hydrogen production from these two substrates."
9,Methane production in untreated sludge systems,"3.3 Methane production in untreated sludge systems The degradation of glucose, primary sludge and municipal wastewater in untreated sludge systems was determined to compare the inherent anaerobic degradability of these substrates. Methane was produced from all three substrates (Fig. 4 ) with methane production from the primary sludge less than that from glucose, and methane production from municipal wastewater lower than both. An examination of the final soluble COD shows that the glucose-fed bottles had likely not completed degradation, with 29.3% of the added COD still present (Table 4 ), and 56% of the remaining soluble COD in the form of acetate, butyrate and propionate (data not shown). The low pH likely slowed methanogenic activity in these bottles (Table 4). In contrast to glucose-fed systems, the primary sludge and municipal wastewater systems had low final soluble CODs (Table 4). For primary sludge, a significant fraction of the non-soluble substrate COD was solubilized with the solubilized COD converted to methane. For municipal wastewater, solubilization cannot be confirmed because the sum of the produced methane COD and the final soluble COD is less than the added soluble COD. The initial soluble COD in the municipal wastewater appears recalcitrant to methanogenesis, just as it was recalcitrant to fermentative hydrogen production. If solubilization of municipal wastewater COD occurred, the products were also recalcitrant to methanogenesis, although they were removed by other mechanisms."
10,Comparison to other research,"3.4 Comparison to other research Van Ginkel et al. (2005) also examined the fermentation of municipal wastewater to produce hydrogen. Using a batch system and a heat treated inoculum, they observed an average hydrogen recovery (mg gaseous H2 as COD/mg added substrate COD) of 2.64%, well above the recoveries measured here and comparable to the primary sludge hydrogen recoveries reported in Table 3. Several key differences in experimental design may have facilitated the higher recovery observed by Van Ginkel et al. (2005). First, they concentrated the municipal wastewater to 6.2g total COD/L, 6.1 times more concentrated than was examined here. Second, their soluble COD was 42% of the total COD in the concentrated wastewater, compared to 27% here, so less solubilization would be required in the bottles. Finally, the pH in their bottles was 5.9, compared to 7.0 here. The lower pH may have been more suitable for fermentative hydrogen production. The Van Ginkel et al. (2005) results could be considered maximum hydrogen recovery results for municipal wastewater, with typical results likely to be lower as observed here. Wang et al. (2003) examined the fermentation of waste activated sludge to produce hydrogen. Using a strain of Clostridium bifermentans as the inoculum source, they observed an average hydrogen recovery of 1.02% for untreated sludge. Sludge pre-treatments to increase solubilization increased the hydrogen recoveries to 2.4–3.4%. Ting et al. (2004) reported recoveries of 0.04–0.24% for waste activated sludge, both untreated and subjected to pre-treatment. These results suggest that, similar to methanogenic sludge digestion, primary sludge is a better substrate for hydrogen production than waste activated sludge and also that the Wang et al. (2003) results could be considered maximum hydrogen recovery results for waste activated sludge."
11,Feasibility of using biosolids pellets,"3.5 Feasibility of using biosolids pellets The energy required to produce biosolids pellets also heat shocks the microbial community, inactivating in particular hydrogen-consuming methanogenic microorganisms. The cost to produce the pellets would be expended as part of a sludge management and disposal plan of the municipal wastewater treatment facility. The cost of the inoculum source for the fermentative hydrogen reactor would then be the purchase price of the pellets. While technically feasible (Khanal et al., 2006), heat treatment will likely cost more, both in capital costs to provide biomass retention and heat treatment, and in operating costs, especially for energy. Technical challenges nevertheless remain for using biosolids pellets in fermentative hydrogen reactors. First, the quantities of biosolids pellets required for reactor start-up and ongoing addition must be identified. Second, if biosolids pellets are continuously added to provide bioagumentation, a system to pre-activate the pellets is required before they enter the fermentation reactor. Otherwise, the lag time needed for the pellets to become biologically active may exceed their retention time in the fermentation reactor. Third, the efficacy of bioaugmentation with biosolids pellets as a mechanism to preclude hydrogen consumption should be formally examined. This would be particularly important for waste streams that may contain hydrogen-consuming organisms. Finally, the material to be treated must be suitable for fermentation to hydrogen. Municipal wastewater is likely a poor substrate for hydrogen fermentation and using biosolids pellets does not change this. Primary sludge, however, may be suitable and additional research should examine the suitability of primary sludge for hydrogen production in continuous systems. Carbohydrate-containing wastewaters likely remain the best substrate for hydrogen fermentation. Biosolids pellets should be well suited to be an inexpensive and renewable inoculum source for these systems."
12,Conclusions,"Biosolids pellets produced from anaerobically digested municipal wastewater sludge should be a practical inoculum source for fermentative hydrogen reactors. The hydrogen recoveries for glucose-fed systems were equal, 20.2–21.5%, between biosolids pellets and boiled sludge as inoculum sources, indicating no adverse effects on the pellets due to pelletization and storage. Boiled sludge provided higher hydrogen recoveries than biosolids pellets for primary sludge and municipal wastewater, but the reason may be increased solubilization of added COD. The hydrogen recoveries from municipal wastewater were less than 1% regardless of inoculum source, suggesting that municipal wastewater is a poor substrate for hydrogen production. The hydrogen recovery from primary sludge was 4.4–12.0 times higher than for municipal wastewater, indicating that primary sludge may be suitable for hydrogen fermentation, although carbohydrate-containing wastewaters will remain the best substrates for fermentative hydrogen production."
