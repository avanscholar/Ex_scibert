0,Introduction,"Currently, exploring efficient ways to selectively oxidize the aromatic alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes and derivatives becomes a research hotspot because of their dispensable role in numerous fields such as fine chemistry, medical industry, fragrances or flavorings production [1,2]. Compared to the traditional industry production methods of aromatic aldehydes which are energy-consuming and ecologically-unfriendly, using solar energy to drive the chemical reactions is an environment-benign way and has received great interest [3–6]. Although abundant heterogeneous photocatalysts have been developed for aromatic aldehydes synthesis with molecular O2 as oxidant so far, to design efficient photocatalysts with appropriate physicochemical properties and practical application value is still a challenge work. Porous crystalline materials like metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with well-defined topologies, inherent porosities and excellent photoelectric property [7–10], and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that are commonly built with organic moieties linked by strong covalent bonds [11–13] have attracted a great interest in photocatalytic field around the world. Generally speaking, there are two distinct advantages of MOFs in photocatalysis: (1) easy to optimize the photocatalytic ability through modulating the structure of materials; (2) accelerated rate of catalytic reaction because of its special narrow channels [14–17]. As to COFs materials, there are plenty of studies confirming that the CN linkage (Schiff base) is versatile in constructing extended π-conjugated systems with almost eclipsed and ordered π-columnar structures [18–20]. Moreover, this Schiff base-based COFs materials show stronger optical absorption in the visible region and structure stability in catalytic reaction system [21–23]. However, it cannot be denied that the rapid recombination rate of photo-induced carries is a main inhibiting factor for those materials displaying excellent catalytic performance adequately [24–28]. Fortunately, MOFs materials are good platforms with large surface area and a lot of functional groups to hybridize with other materials to form heterostructures to improve the photocatalytic ability [29–31]. For instance, Lin et al. adopted an effective charge-assisted self-assembly process to encapsulate a noble metal-free polyoxometalate (POM) inside a MOF, leading to efficient visible-light-driven hydrogen production [32]. Recently, Zhang et al. realized to functionalize MOF with single site catalyst, and the resulting (Co/Ru) n -UiO-67(bpydc) displayed ultra-high efficiency in visible light-driven CO2 reduction for syngas production [33]. In addition, utilizing covalent bonds to combine two different materials is more beneficial for not only the confirmed integration, but also the transportation of photo-induced charge carries than other types of connection [34,35]. Hence, it is a reasonable way to improve their photocatalytic activity by covalently combining the MOFs and COFs appropriately. Recently, a novel hybrid core-shell MOF@COF was synthesized by Peng et al. [36] and showed robust photoactivity in photocatalytic degradation organic dye. Zhang et al. [34] designed a Pd nanoparticles doped TiATA@LZU-1, and found synergistic effect among components, namely “donor-mediator-acceptor”, which could enhance the separation and transportation of photo-induced carriers. Besides, Li et al. [37] synthesized a series of covalent-bonds-connected MOF/COF nanocomposites that showed outstanding photocatalytic activity in photocatalytic H2 evolution. However, the applications of MOF@COF hybrids have been rarely reported in the synthesis of fine chemicals. In this work, we successfully prepared a range of covalent-connected NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA nanocomposites with different thickness of COF shell as efficient and stable photocatalysts for the selective oxidation of alcohols under visible light. In detail, the NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA hybrids were prepared through a novel seed growth method [38], mainly based on the Schiff base reaction between aldehyde of monomer and −NH2 groups on MOFs. Put simply, a low concentration of organic monomers was used to form seed particles on the surface of amino-functionalized MOF firstly, and then an additional high concentration of monomers could connect seed and construct hyperbranched and cross-linked poly(azomethine) structures through Schiff base reaction on the surface of MOF."
1,Experimental,
2,Material preparation,"2.1 Material preparation Synthesis of NH2-MIL-125. NH2-MIL-125 was prepared by the previously reported procedures with slight modifications [39]. In a typical synthesis, 2-aminoterephtalic acid (3 mmol) and titanium tetraisopropoxide (0.87 mmol) were added into a DMF/MeOH solution (9/1 v/v, 10 mL) and kept stirring for 30 min at room temperature, before transferred into a 30 mL Teflon liner and heated at 150 °C for 72 h. After cooled down to room temperature, the bright-yellow NH2-MIL-125 power was isolated by filtration, rinsed with DMF and MeOH for several times, and subsequently dried at 80 °C in air atmosphere for 12 h. Synthesis of NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA hybrid materials. To obtain a series of covalently integrated MOF@COF hybrid materials needs two steps which are similar to Yuan's methods [38]. Firstly, terephthaldehyde (PDA, 0.03 mmol) was dissolved in 5 mL MOF suspension (40 mg mL−1 in dioxane/mesitylene, 4/1 v/v) and kept stirring for 1 h until it became homogeneous. Afterwards, 1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl) benzene (PAPB, 0.02 mmol) and 30 µL acetic acid were added under stirring, and the heterogeneous seed nuclei were formed on surface of NH2-MIL-125 subsequently. In the next step, to obtain highly crystalline MOF@COF hybrid, PDA (0.06, 0.12, 0.18 and 0.24 mmol, respectively) and corresponding amount of PAPB (0.04, 0.08, 0.12 and 0.16 mmol, respectively) were dissolved in the above suspension together, followed by adding a certain amount of acetic acid (60, 120, 180 and 240 µL, respectively). Then the reaction mixture was sealed and heated at 120 °C for 72 h under continuous stirring. After reaction, the yellow precipitates were isolated by centrifugation and washed with THF and ethanol for several times, and subsequently dried at 120 °C under vacuum for 12 h. The resulting products were labeled as NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-1, NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-2, NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-3 and NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-4, respectively. Synthesis of COF. The pure COF was synthesized by the similar synthetic process without the presence of MOF [40]. In detail, PDA (0.3 mmol) and PAPB (0.2 mmol) were dissolved into a 5 mL dioxane/mesitylene solution (4/1 v/v) under stirring, followed by adding 300 µL acetic acid quickly. Then, the reaction mixture was sealed and heated at 120 °C for 72 h under stirring. After reaction, the yellow precipitates were isolated by centrifugation and washed with THF and ethanol for several times, and subsequently dried at 120 °C under vacuum for 12 h."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization X-ray diffraction analysis was carried out using a M21X diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 200 mA with Ni-filtered Cu K α irradiation (λ = 1.514 Å) source and a step size of 0.02°. Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) were obtained by a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer. Solid state 13C NMR spectra were collected with a Bruker AVANCE III 400 M NMR spectrometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were collected using a ZEISS SUPRA 55. The details of the structure of samples were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), JEM-2100F transmission electron microscopy, at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were conducted on a Micromeritics ASAP 2460. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were obtained on a Shimadzu UV-2550, and the reflectance standard was barium sulphate (BaSO4). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed under a flowing air with a rate of 100 mL min–1, from 40 °C to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 using a STA 449F3 instrument. Inductively coupled plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP–OES) tests were performed on Agilent ICPOES 730. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded on a PerkinElmer PHI 5000. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were conducted on a Fluoromax-4 spectrophotometer. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), Mott–Schottky plot and photocurrent-time (I-T) profiles were measured by an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D, Shanghai, China) on a three-electrode system. In detail, Pt and Ag/AgCl electrode were used as counter electrode and reference electrode respectively, and Na2SO4 (0.2 M) was used as the electrolyte solution. The working electrode was prepared by dropping 200 µL suspension (2 mg catalyst was dispersed into 1 mL ethanol and 10 µL Nafion mixed solution) onto an ITO glass substrate (1 × 1 cm2) electrode surface and dried at room temperature. A 300 W Xe lamp (λ > 400 nm) was used as the light source during the photocurrent-time (I-T) test. The EIS results were recorded over a frequency range of 0.01–105 Hz with an amplitude of 5 mV at the same bias voltages. Electronspin resonance (ESR) signal of the radicals spin-trapped by 5,5- dimethyl-l-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) was determined on a Bruker ESR A300 spectrometer. For detection of O2·− and phenoxyl radicals (+R-·CHOH·), photocatalyst is dispersed in acetonitrile where DMPO/benzyl alcohol solution (1:10, v/v) was added. The mixture was oscillated to obtain well-blending suspension."
4,Evaluation of photocatalytic activity,"2.3 Evaluation of photocatalytic activity The photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol was conducted in a 50 mL sealed reaction tube containing photocatalyst (20 mg), acetonitrile (3 mL) and aromatic alcohol (0.2 mmol). The reaction system was degassed and saturated with O2, then the irradiation, a white light LED lamps of 5.0 W power (PCX50A Discover reaction system, Beijing Perfectlight Co., Ltd. λ = 420–780 nm, power density ≈ 150 mW/cm2), was carried out under stirring for 24 h. The reaction in the dark was conducted under the same conditions just without light. After the reaction, the solution, obtained by centrifugation, was analyzed by a gas chromatography-mass spectrum (GC–MS, Agilent7890/5975C-GC/MSD) with HP5-MS column."
5,Results and discussion,"The preparation process of NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA hybrids is displayed in Scheme 1 , and all the photocatalysts were prepared according to the above method. Their corresponding photos (Fig. S1) indicated the colors of the materials after coating COF on MOF change from pale yellow to yellow and to bright yellow with the increasing amount of COF. The XRD patterns were used to confirm the formation of the phase firstly. As to COF, its characteristic peaks mainly appear in the small angle region (0°–30°), as shown in Fig. S2, the (100) plane of PAPB-PDA is the most obvious peak at 2.88°, nevertheless the other planes like (110), (200), (210) and (220), corresponding to peaks at 5°, 5.7°, 7.5° and 10°, are so inconspicuous that need to be observed by magnifying the part of picture [40]. As displayed in Fig. 1 , the diffraction peaks of the as-prepared NH2-MIL-125 are in good agreement with reported literature by Ferey group [41]. The core-shell NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA hybrid materials exhibit diffraction patterns similar to NH2-MIL-125 owing to the relatively weak intensity of COF but with a gradually weaker peak intersity with the increasing proportion of COF in hybrid materials. However, there were no significant changes occurred in the NH2-MIL-125 phases after integrating with COF, indicating the well-maintained skeleton structure and crystallinity of NH2-MIL-125. As shown in Fig. 2 , there is no obvious difference after fabricating with COFs during the wavenumber of 1200 cm−1 to 1650 cm−1 and the absorption peaks are normally ascribed to the N−H banding vibration, OCO asymmetric stretching vibration mode and C−N stretching of aromatic amines [42]. However, it is noteworthy that the peak at 1360 cm−1 becomes weaker in line with the amount of COF due to the change of −NH2 in NH2−MIL−125, indicating the successful combination of TAPB-PDA via Schiff base reaction with −NH2 group in MOF. Furthermore, in comparison with pure MOF, a new absorption band of NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA appeared at the wavenumber of 1700 cm−1 was an irrefutable evidence of the presence of Schiff base [41] and its intensity increased with the increased TAPB-PDA/NH2-MIL-125 wt ratio (Fig. S3), hence it could be concluded that the series of NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA hybrid materials have been successfully synthesized. The 13C solid-state NMR spectroscopy was another valid method to investigate more detailed structure information of materials [41,43]. All the characteristic signals of aromatic carbon atom of NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-3 are analyzed in Fig. S4. Among them, it is noteworthy to find the evidence of imine bond, namely the peak at 156.5 ppm, which indicates the resonance of carbon atom in the imine bond, and confirms the formation of covalently integrated MOF@COF hybrid materials again [44]. The content of MOF and COF in the nanocomposites and thermal stability of all samples were assessed by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in air (Fig. S5). Considering the covalent bond connection is more stable than the coordination bond connection, it is reasonable that the pure COF could retain its structure up to 500 °C [45] while the structure collapse of MOF occurs at around 390 °C. As to NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA hybrid materials, the weight loss between 180 °C and 390 °C can be attributed to the removal of water and small organic molecules from the composites. Besides, there are two rapid mass losses occurred at ca. 390 °C and 500 °C, corresponding to the structure collapse of NH2-MIL-125 and TAPB-PDA respectively. According to residual mass of composites at 800 °C, the content of Ti of hybrid materials could be calculated roughly, which are basically in agreement with the ICP tests, as shown in Table S1. As shown in Fig. 3 (a), the bare NH2-MIL-125 exhibited smooth and clean surfaces and sharp edges, and presented uniform morphology with octahedral shape. The morphology of pure TAPB-PDA was nanosphere with a mean diameter of ca. 300–400 nm which was composed of layered-sheet (Fig. S6). The morphology of COF seeds/NH2-MIL-125 is similar to pristine MOF except the surface becomes a little rough (Fig. S7). After hybridization with TAPB-PDA (Fig. 3b), as expected, NH2-MIL-125 still maintains its aforementioned morphology, however, the surface of NH2-MIL-125 MOF in the hybrid materials is uniformly coated with the vertically grown COF nanosheets and the thickness of shell is ca. 10–60 nm (Fig. S8). Although HRTEM hardly show the clear lattice fringes of MOF and COF, the porous structure of MOF@COF hybrid materials is well presented (Fig. 3e). The element mapping image reveals the well distribution of C, N, O and Ti elements in the composite (Fig. 3f). The results of energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Fig. S9) and inductively coupled plasma optical-emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) show that the average content of Ti of NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-3 is about 17.08 wt.%, respectively, which are comparable to the calculated values based on previous thermogravimetric analyses and ICP tests. The presence of Ti, O, C and N in NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-3 was confirmed by the survey XPS spectra (Fig. 4 a) and these results were in accordance with preceding EDS analysis. Then the high resolution XPS spectrum of C 1s, N 1s and Ti 2p were analyzed further. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the C 1s spectrum could be deconvoluted into four peaks at 284.4, 285.0, 285.8 and 286.7 eV corresponding to the sp 2 CC bond of C atom in benzene ring, the C atom in CN linkage, CN and CC respectively [46]. Compared with the C 1s spectrum of pure MOF, the characteristic peaks assigned to CC and CO nearly disappeared suggesting that a majority of the carbon atoms on the surface of hybrids are in the form of a CC and CN linked π-conjugated systems. The binding energy peaks at 398.8 and 400.3 eV in N 1s spectrum (Fig. 4c) could be assigned to pyridine-like and pyrrole-like N which mainly attributed to COF [47]. To look at it more closely, there were two weak peaks at 402.8 and 403.7 eV corresponding to the amino groups in 2-aminoterephtalic acid and this sharp decrease in density with comparison to N 1s spectrum of NH2-MIL-125 could affirm the covalent linkage connection between the NH2-MIL-125 and TAPB-PDA. And as to Ti 2p spectrum (Fig. 4d), the 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 characteristic peaks were found at 459.1 and 464.6 eV which were in agreement with previous published results for Ti4+ in titanium-oxo cluster [48]. Besides, the introduction of TAPB-PDA in hybrids made the Ti 2p spectrum shift to a lower binding energy while a positive shifting of the binding energy appeared in N 1s spectrum, which confirmed the interaction between the MOF and COF with a possible efficient channel for photo-induced carriers transportation [49]. The nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherm was shown in Fig. 5 and the BET surface area was listed in Table S2. It is obvious that the curve of the pure MOF shows type I isotherm which indicates its typical microporous structure [50] and exhibits the maximum BET surface area (1505.7 m2 g-1). The NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA hybrids materials possess features of type I isotherm and type IV isotherm which indicates the coexistence of microporosity and mesoporosity of the MOF@COF hybrids materials due to a slight desorption hysteresis between adsorption and desorption curves. And the BET surface area values of MOF@COF were lower than pure NH2-MIL-125 with different degrees on account of the content of COF in hybrids. In accordance with expectation, pure TAPB-PDA had the minimum BET surface area of (346.2 m2 g-1). In detail, the BET surface of hybrids materials decreased linearly from 1410.1 to 1169.9 m2 g-1 with the increased content of COF after the combination with COF. In order to explore the photoactivity of hybrids materials in depth, UV-vis spectroscopy was conducted to measure the materials optical absorption properties firstly. As shown in Fig. 6 (a), the NH2-MIL-125 exhibits a well optical absorption capability with the adsorption edge at 500 nm, while the optical adsorption edge of pure TAPB-PDA is determined to be 600 nm because of its higher level of conjugation of the aromatic system. With the formation of covalent-connected NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA hybrid materials, the nanocomposites inherit the optical feature of COF and show obviously more extended absorption band with the increasing weight ratio of COF to MOF. The bandgap energy (E g) values were estimated by the corresponding Tauc plots through calculating the intercept of the tangents of (Ahv)2 vs. photon energy [51]. As shown in Fig. 6(b), the E g values of NH2-MIL-125, NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-1, NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-2, NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-3, NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-4 and TAPB-PDA are estimated to be 2.83, 2.66, 2.63, 2.61, 2.59 and 2.54 eV, respectively. Therefore, the integration with extended crystalline π-conjugated COF could regulate the bandgap of MOF@COF hybrids and improve adsorption capability of visible light. In order to analyze the bandgap details, the valence band (VB) and conduct band (CB) positions were obtained by XPS valence band spectrum (Fig. S10) and Mott–Schottky measurements (Fig. S11), respectively. Obviously both MOF and COF are n-type semiconductors and NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-3 is typical type II heterojunction. It is facile to confirm the VB position of NH2-MIL-125 and TAPB-PDA is approximately 2.46 and 1.61 eV, respectively. While the results determined from Mott–Schottky measurements normally are regarded as the Fermi Level or the flat-band potential which is commonly more positive 0.1 eV than conduct band positions [52]. Accordingly, the bandgap of NH2-MIL-125 and TAPB-PDA obtained by the XPS valence band spectrum and Mott–Schottky plots is 2.81 and 2.57 eV, which are basically in agreement with previous results measured by UV-vis spectroscopy analysis (Table S3). In general, the efficiency of generation, migration, and separation of photo-induced carriers is vital to photocatalytic activity [53]. Photocurrent transient response tests are an effective way to measure the photogenerated charge transfer rate. As depicted in Fig. 7 (a), the photocurrent density of NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-3 is nearly 3.5 times and twice higher than that of NH2-MIL-125 and TAPB-PDA, respectively. The aforementioned conclusion was confirmed further by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement. As shown in Fig. 7(b), the order of arc radius of the samples is NH2-MIL-125 > TAPB-PDA > NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-3, which means the NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-3 has the smallest interfacial charge-transfer resistance and the highest transfer rate. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectrum (Fig. 7c) was a common method to confirm the improvement of photoactivity by measuring the intensity of charge carrier trapping and recombination in photocatalyst. With an excitation wavelength of 375 nm, the NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-3 shows a much less intense peak than NH2-MIL-125 and TAPB-PDA, indicating the introduction of TAPB-PDA could reduce the probability of recombination of photoinduced charges and holes. The selective photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde was chosen to value the photocatalytic performance of all samples. According to the results of a number of control experiments, there are three dispensable factors of a good photocatalytic performance, namely O2 atmosphere, irradiation and photocatalyst. As exhibited in Table 1 clearly, the product of reaction was only benzaldehyde which showed superior selectivity of all photocatalysts (Fig. S12). To be specific, either NH2-MIL-125 or TAPB-PDA alone in tests exhibits a negligible photocatalytic activity with low conversion (37.5% and 6.1%, respectively), which could be attributed to their intrinsic high combination rate of photo-induced carriers. However, MOF@COF hybrid materials exhibited a much high benzaldehyde yield than parent NH2-MIL-125 and TAPB-PDA, which confirmed the COF made an important contribution to improve photocatalytic activity, although itself showed relatively poor catalytic activity. In detail, the benzaldehyde production performance increased approximately linearly as the content of COF in hybrids raised until to NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-3, and it exhibited the highest yield of (94.7%) benzaldehyde which is approximately 2.5 times as NH2-MIL-125 and even 15.5 times as TAPB-PDA. The NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-4 showed a distinct decrease in benzaldehyde yield (65.2%) compared to NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-3 because a much thicker COF shell coating on NH2-MIL-125 might either confine the migration and diffusion ability of reactants, or reduce the efficiency of photo-induce electrons transportation between MOF and COF. In addition, based on the ICP test results of NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-3, the mixture obtained by physically mixing of NH2-MIL-125 and TAPB-PDA was also used to the oxidation of benzyl alcohol under the same conditions. As shown in Table 1, the photocatalytic performance of physically mixed NH2-MIL-125 and TAPB-PDA was far worse than the covalent-integrated core-shell NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-3, suggesting the importance of covalent connection and synergistic effect between MOF and COF. To gain more insight into the reaction process, the plots of conversion versus reacted time and corresponding kinetic rate plots [54] were showed in Fig. 8 . On the premise that photocatalysis of benzyl alcohol is a pseudo-first order reaction, the order of rate constants is the following: NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-3 (1.01 × 10−1 h−1) > NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-2 (5.39 × 10−2 h−1) > NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-4 (4.35 × 10−2 h−1) > NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-1 (2.27 × 10−2 h−1) > NH2-MIL-125 (2.27 × 10−2 h−1), which indicated the NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-3 performs a higher reaction rate than other photocatalysts. To better understand the universal application of as prepared MOF@COF photocatalysts, the optimum photocatalyst NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-3 was selected to oxidize a series of derivatives of aromatic alcohol under previous reaction conditions in the subsequent experiments. The results presented in Table 2 showed the NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-3 still kept excellent performance with high conversion rate and selectivity, but different activities were also observed. The hydrogen atoms of the substrates with electron-withdrawing groups are more difficult to be removed than the substrates with electron-donating groups to form carbon centered radicals [55], the p-methyl benzyl alcohol and p-methoxybenzyl alcohol could be oxidized faster than p-nitro benzyl alcohol and fluorobenzyl alcohol. As to secondary alcohols, because it is the most difficult to take the electron away, the conversion rate of diphenylmethanol and ɑ-methylbenzyl alcohol are relative worse than others. After the photocatalytic reaction, NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-3 was collected by centrifugation and washed with ethanol twice and dried in a 70 °C oven for 24 h. Impressively, NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-3 showed only a little decrease of photocatalytic activity after 5 cycles, conversion of benzyl alcohol still maintaining over 87.5% without other by-products (Fig. 9 ). Besides, the information of morphology and crystal structure of used photocatalyst was similar to that of the fresh one, which also confirms its good stability (Figs. S13 and S14). In order to elucidate the scheme of photocatalysis of benzyl alcohol in this experiment, a series of radical trapping experiments were conducted to explore which active radicals played a vital role in photocatalysis [56,57]. As shown in Table 1, there was only a little benzaldehyde production when the p-benzoquinone and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt were used as scavengers for superoxide radical and holes respectively in the reaction. While when the tert-butanol was added as scavengers for hydroxyl radicals, there was only a little decreased conversion of benzyl alcohol. Electron spin resonance (ESR) was also used to prove the presence of active radicals in reaction system under simulated experiment conditions. As shown in Fig. 10 (a), the obvious peaks for phenoxyl radicals (+R-·CHOH·) were detected with the presence of benzyl alcohol and NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-3. And the ESR signal of DMPO O2 ·− species can also be observed distinctly. So, it could be inferred that superoxide radical anion and holes were playing dispensable roles in the process of aerobic oxidation reaction. Accompanied by previous calculated band structures, a probable efficient path of photo-induced carriers between MOF and COF was depicted in Fig. 10(b). Generally speaking, the outer COF of core-shell hybrids is more likely to act like an appropriate light-harvest material to absorb visible light and the inner MOF mainly serves as a robust catalyst to oxidize reactants. In addition, it is the covalent connection between COF and MOF that plays a prominent role in the transportation of photo-induced electrons and holes, which prompts the separation of photo-induced carriers largely. To be specific, COF was more prone to be excited by irradiation to generate plenty of electrons in conduction band (CB) and holes in valence band (VB) due to its intrinsic narrow bandgap. Then a part of photo-introduced electrons in the CB of COF would not recombine with itself holes but migrate to the CB of MOF due to its litter lower CB than that of COF. The electrons accumulated in the CB of MOF could activate O2 to generate ·O2−. Apart from that, the holes accumulated in the VB of COF could take electron from benzyl alcohol to form carbon centered radicals, which also could reduce the recombination rate of photo-generated electron-hole pairs. Finally, the product benzaldehyde was obtained through the reaction between the benzyl methanol radicals and super-oxide radical."
6,Conclusions,"In summary, we have successfully constructed a series of covalent-connected NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA nanocomposites with different thickness of TAPB-PDA shell through a novel and facile seed growth method. As a proof-of-concept, the crystalline and chemical structure, morphology, composition and states of elements, optical properties and photocatalytic performance have been systematically studied. The results showed that fabricating MOF and COF with covalent bond could effectively broaden the absorption band and reduce the recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. In the photocatalytic tests, the NH2-MIL-125@TAPB-PDA-3 showed the highest conversion (94.7%) which is approximately 2.5 times as that of NH2-MIL-125, and still kept relatively high catalytic activity after 5 cycles under the same reaction condition. Importantly, this type of MOF@COF photocatalysts might provide a great prospective strategy to design visible-light-driven photocatalysts for the photooxidation of aromatic alcohols."
