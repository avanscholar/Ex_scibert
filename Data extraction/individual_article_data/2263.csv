0,Introduction,"The utilization of hydrogen will allow the energy generation with less emission in various activities such as electricity generation and automotive chain. Various other technologies could be developed in association with hydrogen chain. However the hydrogen production technologies for electricity generation purposes are not cost effective in this moment. The trend is diminishing costs of hydrogen production and hydrogen generation systems design, assembly and optimization beyond concerning with volume or weight of hydrogen systems (in the case of vehicles and portable applications). An additional infrastructure of production and distribution must also be taken into account. Fig. 1 depicts potential of the market and technology innovation of cited technologies. Every cited technology usually utilizes renewable sources. Various renewable sources can be utilized to generate hydrogen. In this work glycerol is cited since increasing volume to be produced is due to increasing biodiesel production spurred by program developed by Brazilian Ministry of Mines and Energy (in 2010, B5 fuel, i.e., 5% of biodiesel in the composition of commercialized diesel oil in Brazil could already be commercialized) [2]. Glycerol is a co-product of biodiesel production processes via transesterification, due to crescent production and hence, increase of its offer, its price of commercialization is diminishing. However, various steps must being followed such as purification of some glycerol to be utilized as feedstock of hydrogen in catalytic reactions. Other suggested products utilizing glycerol are 1,3-propanediol, succinic acid, 1,2-propanediol, dihydroxyacetone, polyesters, polyglycerols and polyhydroxyalkanoates [3]. In Brazil, various glycerol sources could be utilized such as vegetable and animal feedstocks. The utilization of feedstocks depends strongly on potentialities of each region. Brazil has 76,697,324ha utilized for various cultures, especially soybean, corn (maize) and sugarcane [4]. A supplementary area of 102,170,538ha (12% of overall Brazilian territory) is also able to cultivation [5]. Additionally, an area of 172,333,073ha is comprised by field, which is occupied by bovines [4]. However, the density of the bovine cattle is extremely low, attaining only 1.2 bovine per hectare (considering 205,886 millions of bovines in 2006 as seen in IBGE [4]), varying according with the state [4]. This amount could be easily increased, this enormous area is also utilized for agriculture, guaranteeing a major food, feed and fuel production, revenue, and jobs. Following Scot Consultoria [6], to obtain 8 heads per hectare is possible. Due to the increase of demand and the increase of price of petroleum-based fuels, production of biofuels (such as ethanol and biodiesel) is ever-increasing. However, an attention must also be paid concerning food and feed production since, in some cases, ethanol production from cereals such as corn (in USA), and wheat and sorghum (in Europe) have contributed to the increase of food and feed prices due to displacing of cultures for fuel production. In some cases, substitution of native vegetation for biodiesel production is unfortunately observed in countries of Southeastern Asia such as Malaysia and Indonesia where palm is used. In this case, the benefits of biodiesel utilization are minimized due to the land use change. Various feedstocks could be utilized depending on climate (temperature range and availability of water) and soil conditions. Subsequently, a more accurate study can be performed such as energy balance of biodiesel production utilizing glycerol for hydrogen production. Researches concerning hydrogen production utilizing glycerol have been largely performed worldwide; however, reports and works linking hydrogen production utilizing “bioglycerol” and its impact on economy and agriculture were not available yet. An additional research could be performed to evaluate the “carbon footprint”, which denotes environmental impact of a determined activity such as emission of pollutants from production of their feedstocks to hydrogen production system [7]. The dynamics of biohydrogen production as cited in this work can be altered due to the increase of global temperature. Various works have predicted the increase of temperature in various Brazilian regions, which can contribute to increase or decrease or even stop the agricultural production such as coffee in Minas Gerais state, the biggest Brazilian producer [8]."
1,Transesterification process,"Transesterification is one of the main processes of biodiesel and glycerol production, where one molecule of oil and three molecules of alcohol (methanol or ethanol) allow production of three molecules of ester (biodiesel) and one molecule of glycerol. Some advantages and disadvantages of both alcohols are depicted in Table 1 . In this work, the utilization of ethanol for transesterification process is also suggested due to high availability and consolidated infrastructure of production, storage, transportation and distribution all over Brazilian territory. Most of the reports about transesterification reactions indicate higher reactivity with methanol. Hence, most of the biodiesel facilities are utilizing this type of alcohol. However, the trend is to utilize ethanol in Brazil as higher efficiencies are obtained [9]."
2,Glycerol chemistry,"Studies involving glycerol have occurred only recently due to the increase of its production with the increase of biodiesel production. Taking advantage of its high environmental appeal, various co-products could be obtained as alternative stuffs from synthetic feedstocks, especially petroleum- and coal-based stuffs. A novel term called “glycerolchemistry” was recently adopted by some researchers to evaluate the cited chain [10,11]. The glycerolchemistry is beginning, and to develop its enormous potential, a taskforce must be created."
3,Calculations,"The calculations encountered in this work involve glycerol, hydrogen and electricity production. Calculations to obtain amounts of glycerol were performed utilizing the highest performances found in the literature for the cited feedstocks. Most of the presented reactions confirm higher reactivity utilizing methanol. The calculation of ratios oil/glycerol is based on average content of each oil (which includes different fatty acids) as seen in the work performed by Pousa [12]. In Table 2 , values of higher available conversation rates and obtained ratios oil/glycerol are found. However, ratio oil/glycerol of wastewater was not encountered, being estimated a value of 10. Various technologies of hydrogen production utilizing glycerol are available, especially thermochemical reactions. The adopted technology for hydrogen production utilizing glycerol is steam reforming, however other reactions could be also performed such as cracking, partial oxidation, aqueous-phase reforming, autothermal reforming or even gasification. The main thermochemical reactions are described below [11]: Cracking: C3H8O3 →3(CO)+4(H2) ΔH°=245kJ/mol Partial oxidation: C3H8O3 +1.5(O2)→3(CO2)+4(H2) ΔH°=−603kJ/mol Global steam reforming: C3H8O3(g)+3(H2O)→3(CO2)+7(H2) ΔH°=215kJ/mol Aqueous-phase reforming: C3H8O3(l)+3(H2O)→3(CO2)+7(H2) ΔH°=123kJ/mol Autothermal reforming: C3H8O3 +O2 +H2O→3(CO2)+5(H2) ΔH°=−269kJ/mol The study of reactions could be performed through assessment of response reactions (RERs), whose model was developed by Fishtik et al. [17]. For example, the steam reforming could be performed with production of species such as CH4, CO, solid carbon, and others, not only H2 ad CO2. Indeed, it is necessary to determine the number of species to be produced at each reaction. The steam reforming process was chosen in this work for a more accurate study of hydrogen production utilizing glycerol due to advantages such as high efficiency of hydrogen generation and lower cost of generation. Additional findings could be observed on some reports and works [18]. A physical–chemical analysis was performed by Souza and Silveira [18]. In this work, determined amounts of produced hydrogen were predicted depending on determined thermodynamic conditions. The suggested conditions were reforming at atmospheric pressure and at 700°C. Following these conditions, to produce 1Nm3/h of gaseous hydrogen an amount of 0.948kg/h of glycerol is necessary if an additional amount of glycerol is utilized to supply heat for steam reforming process since this is an endothermic reaction, i.e., an external supply of heat is necessary to generate reaction. However, if other heat source is utilized, an amount of 0.872kg/h is necessary. The electricity could be generated by fuel cells. As syngas from steam reforming process contains high content of gases which are poisonous in low-temperature fuel cells such as PEMFCs (proton exchange membrane fuel cells), the utilization of high-temperature fuel cells such as SOFCs (solid oxide fuel cells) is mandatory. An efficiency of electricity generation of 50% was adopted in the calculations. An annual period of 5000h was considered since most of feedstocks are not produced all year long."
4,Bioethanol,"The production of sugarcane-based-bioethanol in Brazil has been increasing due to demand for automotive purposes. However the utilization of methanol is higher due to higher efficiencies of transesterification detected in various experiments compared with the use of ethanol. As ethanol from sugarcane is renewable and responsible by lower environment impact, the trend in Brazil is a higher utilization of ethanol for this purpose. Table 3 depicts world leaders in sugarcane production. Fig. 2 depicts areas of sugarcane cultures in Brazil. In Southeastern and Southern Brazil higher productions of sugarcane and hence sugarcane-based ethanol is encountered. This higher concentration in these regions is due to higher development of ethanol chain in the last three decades for automotive purposes. This consolidated sugarcane and ethanol production (which involves production, storage and distribution) could contribute to the development of FAEE (fatty-acid ethyl ester) chain, i.e., biodiesel utilizing ethanol, with additional production of glycerol. In regions which concentrates the highest ethanol production, also concentrates the highest production of soybean, peanut, beef tallow, wastewater and utilized edible oil, which allows a major volume of biodiesel production at lower cost mainly due to low cost of transportation of feedstocks, oils, ethanol, and finally FAEE to mix with diesel oil. In other regions, where the highest productions of palm and castor are encountered, an improvement of transportation chain is necessary to get lower cost compared with diesel oil in this way. The production of ethanol in situ is suggested hence avoiding a high environmental impact such as caused by deforestation. The utilization of depleted areas is necessary to confirm the high environmental appeal of this activity. In Table 4 , the production of sugarcane in each state is depicted. As cited by CTC/Copersucar, 2007 [23], 1ton of sugarcane is able to produce 75L if ethanol (better results were encountered attaining 85–90L), 280kg of bagasse, and 280kg of straw (in the case of mechanical harvest). The moisture of bagasse and straw is 50%. For biodiesel production utilizing ethanol, a volume of 3L of oil for each litre of ethanol were estimated [2]."
5,Electricity generation in Brazil,"The electricity production utilizing glycerol could also contribute to distributed generation, especially in periods when a minor amount of water is available to hydroelectric generation. This concern is because this is the most important way of electricity generation in Brazil. Table 5 depicts electricity generation and installed electric power in Brazil."
6,Residues as feedstocks,Various feedstocks encountered in Brazil are currently utilized in transesterification processes. The following residues as feedstocks are cited below. These residues could be utilized due to enormous available volumes.
7,Wastewater (scum),"7.1 Wastewater (scum) The wastewater, which is especially from domestic origin, is comprised by about 160g of solid components (scum) for each 200L of liquid phase. From the scum, 10% is fat [25]. In Brazil, about 60% of the wastewater is collected, and about 30% is treated. The volumes of collected and treated wastewater for each state are cited in Table 6 . Beyond utilizing wastewater to produce gray water, biogas and sludge (being that two last products can be utilized for energy purposes) its treatment contributes to the improvement of life quality, and hence avoids illness. The trend is to continue the development of projects concerning collecting and treating of wastewater, also contributing to diversify energy supply [26]. Table 7 depicts annual potentiality of hydrogen and electricity generation utilizing scum obtained in wastewater treatment plants in progress."
8,Coffee,"7.2 Coffee Brazil has the highest world coffee production, having higher productions in states of Minas Gerais (MG). Espírito Santo (ES), Paraná (PR) and São Paulo (SP). However, about 20% of national production of coffee is composed by defective coffee that could be utilized for biodiesel production [15,27]. Fig. 3 depicts main types of defective coffee, which is not utilized for coffee production for drinking purposes but could be utilized for biodiesel production and bioglycerol via transesterification process. The coffee production in Brazil was comprised by Arabic (76%) and Robust (24%) coffees in 2006 [29]. Fig. 4 depicts distribution of Arabic and Robust coffee in Brazil. Fig. 5 shows distribution of coffee in the world, exclusively in the Tropical macroclimate. Table 8 shows data about coffee production in Brazilian state in 2008, and impact on hydrogen and electricity production. Tables 9–14 depict the same data, however, extracted monthly in 2007."
9,Beef tallow,"7.3 Beef tallow A typical Brazilian bovine head has 470kg as soon as it is killed. About 16kg of beef tallow per head is extracted [35]. The Brazilian bovine cattle are the second highest in the world (see in Table 15 ) and the first if considered only cattle to be utilized in the meat chain. Bovines are widely encountered in Brazilian territory, especially in Mid-Western and Southeastern Brazil. As an example, in the city of Lins (São Paulo State), Bertin (an enterprise that maintain abattoirs) established a biodiesel plant whose capacity is 100,000ton of beef tallow per year [37]. The foreseen volume of predicted hydrogen to be produced is 30,000Nm3 per day, and utilizing a SOFC, the generated energy could attain 64MWh per day. As seen in this text, an array could be performed with objective to optimize energy generation and utilization in the biodiesel plant and abattoirs as a whole. Table 16 depicts the utilization of the land in Brazil. The capacity of energy generation utilizing beef tallow in each state is cited in Table 17 . An attention must be paid to the increase in the price of tallow beef, which is currently utilized in the production of soaps [39]."
10,Other feedstocks,"Among vegetable feedstocks widely utilized in Brazil, the main one is soybean, having palm and castor bean as other important feedstocks. Other feedstocks such as sunflower seed, peanut, babassu and others can be utilized in the near future, taking advantage their potentialities. Last year, an enormous attention was paid to the development of biodiesel chain, especially using castor. This preference was paid due to its high productivity in Brazil and also due to high social impact. These facts were also verified utilizing vegetable feedstocks such as palm (especially in Northern Brazil), babassu (obtained through extractivism way in states such as Maranhão and Piauí), wastewater, utilized edible oil and beef tallow. Other advantage of castor bean is the possibility of development of joint cultures such as green bean, peanut or maize. However, with high social impact paid by these feedstocks, a higher biodiesel production in Brazil is given by soybean due to its low cost, beyond soybean culture is the main Brazilian culture in terms of area. However, the social impact and productivity (oil production per area) is much lower [40]. In 2007, 59% of produced biodiesel came from soybean, 26% came from castor bean, and 15% came from other feedstocks [40]. In Europe, the main vegetable feedstock is canola, which has productivity between 350 and 400kg of oil per hectare, satisfactory for European conditions [8]. Table 18 depicts the cultivated area in Brazil. The first culture is soybean, which is utilized especially for production of edible oils, consumption in natura and for feed, having other cultures such as sugarcane which supplies ethanol. Transesterification process is a recent activity in Brazil with enormous potential to increase. Obviously, the production of soybean, sugarcane, castor bean, peanuts, and others will increase enormously. Table 19 depicts values of vegetable oil production in Brazil. The order of feedstocks (seen in Table 18) and percentage is near that observed in transesterification processes, where the main feedstock is also soybean. Table 20 shows the content of oil of main biodiesel and glycerol feedstocks. Various estimations have been performed to evaluate the potential of utilization of each plant in Brazil. The utilization of jatropha is recent, and in Brazil, the potential is enormous since this plant could be utilized in various Brazilian regions, inclusively arid regions such as Northeastern Brazil. About 40 millions of hectares are able to be utilized for this purpose [41]. In Fig. 6 , regions with high potential of development of jatropha were cited. The potential of the palm is Brazil is high. The actual utilized area in Brazil is about 60,000ha, however, the able area is 100 times higher (considering depleted areas only) [8]. This plant is usually localized in regions where high indexes of pluviosity and high temperatures during the year are encountered (such as Equatorial climate in Brazil, localized in the North region), as seen in Fig. 7 . About 70% of depleted area previously occupied by Amazon Jungle is used for cattle, generally at very low density of heads. One part of this depleted area is also occupied by soybean production. An attention must being paid to avoid disruptions in terms of commerce of products such as meat, soybean and its derivatives such as biodiesel and glycerol. The main argument is the fact of environmentally friendly stuff that is generated with high environmental impact [43–45]. Some plants such as peanut could be utilized to recovery nitrogen utilized in the sugarcane culture and to avoid erosion in periods when soil is not utilized. Brazil has the highest world production of sugarcane, and the potential of peanut production is enormous. Other cultures could be utilized such as soybean. In the case of some regions of Southeastern Brazil, the productivity and revenue paid by peanut also allow the wide development of this culture. In São Paulo State, which has the highest Brazilian production, this culture could be applied between October and February [20]. As said Rodrigues [20], two thirds of the area traditionally utilized by sugarcane could also be utilized for other cultures (via rotation), being that, in this selected area, 20% could be utilized for peanut culture (which has a potential to attain 4ton/ha), and 80% could be utilized for soybean culture (which has a potential to attain 3ton/ha). Cultures of peanut and soybean could be developed out of period of sugarcane (especially between December and March in Mid-Western, Southeastern and Southern Brazil) [20,22]. Table 21 shows the production of peanut in Brazil and São Paulo state [46]. São Paulo State has the highest peanut and ethanol productions, which contributes to develop the biodiesel and glycerol chain utilizing both stuffs, and hence, diminishing their costs. As cited above, soybean could also be utilized to supply nitrogen, highly utilized by sugarcane, taking advantage of the consolidated infrastructure of storage and transportation and knowledge obtained in the last years. The increase in productivity of this plant has been high, being the main feedstock of biodiesel in Brazil. The productivity of peanut is similar to that obtained by soybean (whose production also is observed in Table 22 and in Fig. 8 ), having a high potential of biodiesel and glycerol production. Despite technical problems recently encountered in castor-based biodiesel (such as high viscosity and high cost of production), an area of 4.5 millions of hectares is able to cultivate. Other varieties of castor must be developed with objective to produce a more adequate oil to attain technical specifications [34]. Table 23 shows production of castor bean in Brazil and Bahia state, where the highest Brazilian production is encountered. However, a higher productivity of castor bean could be attained whether consolidated researches are developed since productivity of 2000kg/ha is possible [33]. Table 24 depicts production ratio of each feedstock. Tables 25–28 depict amount of produced glycerol, hydrogen, electricity and average power per hectare, respectively, devoted by some feedstocks depending on the region and month when these feedstocks are harvested, from January (J) to December (D). These data were based on obtained information of 2005. The trend is to increase the values of productivities of cited cultures. The overwhelming increase of sugarcane culture (especially for production of ethanol as a fuel) also allows the increase of peanut and soybean via rotation of cultures."
11,H-BIO,"Recently, PETROBRAS (Petróleo Brasileiro S.A.), a Brazilian company, developed a novel fuel called H-BIO. This fuel comes from a reaction between bio-oil and hydrogen, which could be produced by steam reforming of glycerol cited in this work. Beyond H-BIO, “biopropane” production is detected, whose fuel is constituent of LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) [47]. The obtained volumes of products are cited below [47]: 100 L bio-oil + 35 N m 3 H 2 = 96 L of H-BIO + 2.2 N m 3 of propane The potential of H-BIO and “biopropane” production are depicted in Tables 29 and 30 respectively, from January (J) to December (D)."
12,Potential of hydrogen production and electricity generation utilizing glycerol,"In this topic, the amount of hydrogen production and electricity generation utilizing glycerol was evaluated. Utilizing residues, the amount of collected wastewater, defective coffee and beef tallow were considered. These values were cited above. The highest potential of biodiesel and bioglycerol production is devoted by palm. As cited previously the potential is 60 million of hectares [34]. The potential of soybean was based on areas traditionally utilized by sugarcane (as cited above, 80% of sugarcane area is able for rotation) and areas able to be obtained from bovines whether its density increases to two heads per hectare although as cited previously this density could be increased to eight heads per hectare with additional investments [6,20]. The choice of two heads per hectare is conservative since it depends on availability of infrastructure. Basing on these assumptions, the additional area to be utilized by soybean is about 8.18 million of hectares. In the case of castor bean, as cited previously, the potential of utilization plus area currently utilized is 4.5 million of hectares [34]. And as cited previously, the suggested area to be utilized by peanut is 0.91 million of hectares [20]. Table 31 depicts potential of hydrogen and electricity generation basing on assumptions cited in this work. Considering the cited assumptions, the potential of electricity generation is 56,468GWh, i.e., 14% of electricity generation in Brazil in 2005. Most of the potential is devoted by palm. Other feedstocks are responsible by less than 1% of electricity generation, however this feedstocks could contribute to supply energy in own facilities such as abattoirs (utilizing beef tallow) and wastewater treatment plant (utilizing scum from wastewater). Additionally, some feedstocks such as cotton seed and peanut without irrigation could be harvested in a period of lower pluviosity being an alternative to hydroelectric power plants, the main way of Brazilian electricity generation. This period (in most of Brazilian regions, where Tropical climate is encountered) is between May and August. In Amazon jungle, where palm is encountered, the energy generation utilizing glycerol from palm oil could contribute for a decentralized generation in a region where small cities and villages generate electricity utilizing internal combustion engines whose fuel is petroleum-based diesel, a non-renewable source of energy. The utilization of hydrogen via steam reforming of glycerol associated with fuel cell is an alternative of renewable and decentralized generation of energy with low emission of pollutants."
13,Conclusions,"The results allow evaluating the effectivity of hydrogen generation utilizing glycerol via steam reforming. As cited previously, various thermochemical reactions can be developed for this purpose. A wide range of feedstocks could be utilized to produce glycerol via transesterification of oils and greases. Some calculations were developed to evaluate the potential of hydrogen production and hence, electricity generation via fuel cell. The suggested fuel cells are those operated at high temperatures (such as SOFCs) since high-purity hydrogen is not necessary, diminishing costs with hydrogen purification systems. In the cited feedstocks the potential of hydrogen production and electricity generation in each Brazilian state were also calculated. For feedstocks such as castor bean, palm, peanut and soybean, the potential of hydrogen production and electricity generation per hectare were calculated, and in the case of residual feedstocks (wastewater scum, defective coffee and beef tallow), the potential of hydrogen production and electricity generation based on volume of available feedstocks were calculated. The highest potential, as cited above, was encountered utilizing glycerol from palm oil. The potential of electricity generation utilizing this feedstock is 54,600GWh per annum. The advantage of this feedstock is that its harvest, in contrary to other cultures, is constant, i.e., its harvest can be developed during the year. Taking an assumption of a annual period of operation of 5000h, the foreseen overall installed power of electricity through fuel cells coupled with steam reforming system is 11.3GW, an enormous potential which could contribute to increase the quality of electricity supply, inclusively in regions that are not connected with grid. The annual potential of electricity generation utilizing residues is 318.58GWh with overall installed potential of 63.72MW. The potential of electricity generation of other feedstocks (castor bean, peanut and soybean) is 1587GWh/year, with installed potential of 317.49MW. Additionally, other feedstocks could be considered; however in Brazil some researches are being performed to increase productivity such as jatropha, sunflower and others. In near future this feedstock will be important to consolidate biodiesel production and hence, glycerol, hydrogen and electricity. About utilization of biohydrogen for other purposes, this is a good alternative for some industries such as food industries, which utilizes hydrogen especially in hydrogenation process of oils and greases. In this work, the production of H-BIO was also considered. Utilizing hydrogen produced through steam reforming of glycerol, high amounts of H-BIO and biopropane could be produced. For process of transesterification, utilizing the cited feedstocks, 56 billionL of ethanol are necessary to develop transesterification process to produce biodiesel and glycerol. Not considering utilization of palm, the amount of ethanol decreases to 2.97 billionL of ethanol. Considering a production of 6000L/ha of sugarcane, the extension of the areas necessary to produce the calculated volumes of ethanol are 94.148km2 (with transesterification of palm oil) and 4.951km2 (without transesterification of palm oil). Both values are small compared with available areas to expand this culture."
