0,Introduction,"There is growing consensus that hydrogen (H2) will replace fossil fuels as the principal energy carrier in the near future, though a seamless transition to the envisaged “hydrogen economy” requires major technical advancements in hydrogen production and storage, of which the former is arguably the most challenging [1–4]. Current hydrogen production technologies based around steam methane reforming (SMR) and the water-gas shift reaction are efficient and mature, but are not sustainable long term as they are energy intensive, based on a non-renewable natural gas feedstock and have a significant carbon footprint [5–7]. Various alternative H2 production technologies are presently being pursued [8–12], with water splitting using sunlight and semiconductor photocatalysts considered one of the best long term prospects for the delivery of a carbon neutral H2 supply [13–15]. M/TiO2 photocatalysts, where M represents certain high work function metals including Ni, Pd, Pt or Au, demonstrate good activity and stability for water splitting in the presence of sacrificial reagents under UV or full solar irradiation [16–21]. The band edges of TiO2 are appropriate for water splitting, since the top of the valence band (+2.7V vs. NHE for anatase) is more positive than the O2/H2O redox couple (+1.23V vs. NHE), and the bottom of the conduction band (−0.5V vs. NHE for anatase) is more negative than the H2O/H2 redox couple (0.0V vs. NHE). The band gap energy of TiO2 (E g =3.0, 3.2 and 3.3eV for rutile, anatase and brookite, respectively) is also sufficiently small to allow solar excitation, which is a critical requirement for any practical water-splitting photocatalyst. Whilst bulk absorption of electromagnetic radiation with E > E g generates electron–hole pairs (e−–h+) in TiO2 that could potentially drive water splitting, bare TiO2 surfaces demonstrate negligible activity for H2 production due to (1) rapid electron–hole pair recombination after photoexcitation; and (2) the high overpotential for H2 evolution on TiO2 surfaces. Deposition of Ni, Pd, Pt or Au on TiO2 creates rectifying Schottky junctions [16–21], the formation of which is highly beneficial for hydrogen evolution as the Fermi level (E F) for each metal sits between the bottom of the TiO2 conduction band and the H2O/H2 redox couple (for 5nm Au nanoparticles on TiO2, E F =−0.27V) [21]. Electrons photo-excited into the conduction band of TiO2 and thus migrate onto the supported metal nanoparticles, thereby suppressing electron hole pair recombination in TiO2, whilst the metal nanoparticles themselves function as cathodic sites for H2 evolution. The addition of sacrificial agents (typically electron donors such as methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol or glycerol) with oxidation potentials lower than water further suppresses electron hole pair recombination in TiO2. In such systems, both water splitting (H2O→1/2O2 +H2) and alcohol photoreforming occur (e.g. CH3OH+H2O→CO2 +3H2 and CH3CH2OH+3H2O→2CO2 +6H2), which under carefully optimised reaction conditions can yield H2 production rates as high as 30–40mmolg−1 h−1 at UV fluxes comparable to those in sunlight. For a given M/TiO2 photocatalyst, H2 production rates are known to depend closely on the co-catalyst loading, the TiO2 support composition (anatase, brookite, rutile or biphasic combinations thereof) and the type of sacrificial agent used. A gap in the current literature is the lack of comprehensive studies simultaneously examining the effects of both the TiO2 support and the alcohol hole scavenger on H2 production rates in M/TiO2 systems. It is unclear whether the relative activities of M/TiO2 photocatalysts prepared using different TiO2 supports are altered by the type of alcohol hole scavenger used in the photocatalytic tests, motivating further investigations. TiO2 exists in three main polymorphic forms, all of which have electronic band gaps in the near UV region [22–24]. The three polymorphs are constructed from TiO6 octahedra, differing primarily in the connectivity of the octahedra. Rutile has a tetragonal unit cell (P42/mnm, a =4.5937Å, c =2.9587Å; Z =2), with a structure that can be described as chains of edge sharing TiO6 octahedra running parallel to the c-axis [25]. Rutile is the most stable TiO2 polymorph, though generally has poor photocatalytic activity owing to the fact it is a direct band gap semiconductor which allows fast electron–hole pair recombination following photoexcitation [26,27]. Anatase also crystallises with a tetragonal unit cell (I41 /amd, a =3.7845Å, c =9.5143Å; Z =4), with each TiO6 octahedra edge sharing with four adjacent octahedra [25]. Anatase is an indirect band gap semiconductor, typically displaying photocatalytic activities 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than rutile due to longer charge carrier lifetimes. In brookite, each octahedron shares three edges with adjoining octahedra, to form an orthorhombic structure (Pbca, a =5.4558Å, b =9.1819Å, c =5.1429Å, Z=8) [25]. To date, only a limited amount of data is available about the photocatalytic activity of brookite, owing to historical difficulties in synthesising this polymorph in pure form [28,29]. Though it has yet to be unequivocally confirmed, brookite is considered to be an indirect band gap semiconductor, which is consistent with its photocatalytic activity being comparable to anatase in many photoreactions. Mixed phase TiO2 catalysts have also been widely studied, owing to synergistic electron transfer phenomena that can be realised in such systems. Degussa P25 TiO2 (a 6:1 mixture of anatase and rutile by weight) typically demonstrates superior activity to pure anatase for most photocatalytic reactions [30–32]. Transfer of photo-excited electrons from the conduction band of rutile to that of anatase across interfacial heterojunctions (the conduction band of anatase is 0.2eV more positive versus NHE than that of rutile), and hole migration from the valence band of anatase to that of rutile, facilitates charge separation and increases the number of charge carriers available for photoreactions [33]. Photoreaction rates generally scale in proportion to charge carrier concentrations. Similar positive synergies have also been reported in brookite–rutile and anatase–brookite systems (possible since the conduction bands of anatase, brookite and rutile are offset at −0.5, −0.6 and −0.7V versus SHE, respectively). The effect of the TiO2 support composition on the activity of M/TiO2 photocatalysts for H2 production in alcohol–water systems has been the subject of a number of investigations [27,33–35], but very few studies actually encompass all three TiO2 polymorphs and biphasic supports such as P25. Gauging the relative merits of P25, anatase, brookite and rutile as supports from existing literature is not straightforward, as additional factors including TiO2 crystallite size, crystallite shape, surface area and photocatalytic test conditions also strongly impact H2 production rates in M/TiO2 systems. Arguably the least researched aspect of photocatalytic H2 production in alcohol–water systems is the effect of the alcohol sacrificial agent. Very few literature studies compare H2 rates for M/TiO2 photocatalysts in different alcohol–water mixtures, or even at a single alcohol at different alcohol–water concentrations [16–40]. Bowker et al. reported hydrogen production rates for the photoreforming of a variety of bio-derivable feedstocks over Pd/P25 under UV excitation, and observed that the rate decreased in the order glycerol>aq. d-glucose>methanol>ethanol≈aq. sucrose>1-butanol [17]. Bahruji et al. presented a more comprehensive study of the Pd/P25 system using 20 different sacrificial reagents, and established the reactivity series triols>diols>2° alcohols>1° alcohols>3° alcohols [18]. From this pattern of reactivity, it was concluded that the sacrificial hole scavenger must have an α-H adjacent to the OH group(s), with the other main by-products of alcohol photoreforming being largely predictable based on the alcohol structure. Bowker et al. later investigated the Au/P25 system, and found that H2 production rates decreased in the order methanol>1-propanol>ethanol>1-butanol>2-propanol≫tertiary butanol [19]. Yang et al. examined UV irradiated suspensions of Pt/anatase in different alcohol–water mixtures, and observed that H2 evolution rates decreased in the order methanol≈ethanol>1-propanol≈2-propanol>1-butanol [36]. A correlation was established between the H2 production rate and alcohol polarity. Li et al. investigated Cu2O/P25 photocatalysts for H2 evolution from aqueous solution with different hole scavengers, and established the activity series methanol>ethylene glycol≈glycerol>ethanol under UV–Vis excitation [37]. Wang et al. examined photocatalytic H2 production from aliphatic alcohol–water mixtures over Pt/TiO2 nanotubes [38]. The rate of H2 production followed the trend methanol>ethanol>i-propanol>n-propanol>sec-butanol>tert-butanol. Recently, Su et al. demonstrated that Pd(shell)–Au(core) nanoparticles immobilised on TiO2 exhibit high quantum efficiencies for H2 production in a wide range of aqueous alcohols, observing that photocatalyst activity followed the sequence methanol>glycerol>ethanol>1,2-propanediol>ethylene glycol>aq. glucose>aq. fructose [39]. These studies provide a reasonable guide as to the general reactivity pattern followed by M/TiO2 photocatalysts in alcohol–water mixtures. What is not clear is the influence of the TiO2 support on these reactivity series (all of the above studies used a single TiO2 support). This work aimed to fill several key gaps in the scientific literature concerning photocatalytic H2 production over Au/TiO2 photocatalysts in alcohol–water systems. 1.5wt.% Au/TiO2 photocatalysts were prepared using P25, anatase, brookite and rutile supports, and their performance was evaluated for H2 production in 10vol.% methanol–water, ethanol–water, ethylene glycol–water and glycerol–water mixtures under UV excitation (6.5 mW cm−2). The objectives of this study were 3-fold: (i) to rank the activity of the different Au/TiO2 photocatalysts for H2 production in each alcohol-water system; (ii) to rank the alcohol sacrificial agents in terms of their ability to promote hydrogen production; and (iii) to explore relationships between photocatalytic H2 production rates and specific properties of the alcohols (e.g. number of α-H, number of hydroxyl groups, alcohol polarity or the standard oxidation potential, E ox o)."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials P25 TiO2 (⩾99.5%), brookite (99.99%), titanium(IV) isopropoxide (97%), 2-propanol (99.5%), HAuCl4·3H2O (99%), urea (⩾99.5%), HCl (34–37wt.%) and glycerol (⩾99%), were all obtained from Sigma–Aldrich and used without further purification. Methanol (99.8%), absolute ethanol (⩾99.5%) and ethylene glycol (>95%) were obtained from ECP Ltd and used without further purification. All solutions were prepared using milli-Q water (18.2MΩcm)."
3,Synthesis of sol–gel anatase,"2.2 Synthesis of sol–gel anatase An amorphous sol–gel TiO2 powder was synthesised by the hydrolysis of titanium(IV) isopropoxide in 2-propanol [41]. Briefly, titanium (IV) isopropoxide (28.4g) and 2-propanol (125mL) were poured into a 500mL glass Schott bottle. With vigorous stirring, water (108.1g) was slowly added dropwise to the titanium isopropoxide solution over a period of 1h at 20°C. The solution was then stirred for 24h, and the amorphous TiO2 powder obtained was collected by vacuum filtration and washed repeatedly with milli-Q water. The product was then dried at 70°C overnight to remove any residual water or 2-propanol. The dried amorphous TiO2 was then ground to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle, before being calcined at 475°C for 4h. This calcination treatment yielded an anatase powder with a crystallite size similar to the anatase fraction in P25 TiO2 [42]. This anatase powder is denoted as anatase SG in the text below."
4,Hydrothermal anatase and rutile synthesis,"2.3 Hydrothermal anatase and rutile synthesis The amorphous sol–gel TiO2 powder synthesised in Section 2.2 was also used to make nanocrystalline anatase and rutile powders via hydrothermal (HT) routes. An anatase HT powder was prepared by adding the amorphous sol–gel TiO2 (1g) to 50mL of an ethanol–water mixture (2:1 by volume), and then transferring the resulting dispersion into a teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (the total internal volume of the teflon cup was 100mL). The autoclave was then heated to 160°C for 16h. The obtained anatase powder was collected by centrifugation, washed repeatedly with milli-Q water, and dried in air at 100°C. A rutile HT powder was prepared in a similar manner, using 4molL−1 HCl as the dispersion medium and a higher reaction temperature of 175°C."
5,Au/TiO2 photocatalyst synthesis,"2.4 Au/TiO2 photocatalyst synthesis Au nanoparticles were deposited on the 5 different TiO2 supports (P25, brookite, anatase SG, anatase HT and rutile HT) at a nominal Au loading of 1.5wt.% using the deposition-precipitation with urea method described by Zanella et al. [43]. Briefly, a 4.2mM Au3+ stock solution was prepared by dissolving HAuCl4·3H2O (1.65g) in 1L of milli Q water. TiO2 powder (2g), Au3+ stock solution (37.5mL for target nominal Au loading of 1.5wt.%), urea (5.04g) and milli-Q water (162.5mL) were added to a 500mL glass Schott bottle, then heated with constant stirring at 80°C for 8h. The obtained pale yellow powders (likely Au(OH)3/TiO2 or Au(OH)3− x Cl x /TiO2) were collected by vacuum filtration, washed repeatedly with milli-Q and then air dried at 60°C overnight. The powders were then calcined at 300°C for 2h to reduce surface Au(III) to Au0."
6,TiO2 and Au/TiO2 photocatalyst characterisation,"2.5 TiO2 and Au/TiO2 photocatalyst characterisation UV–Vis absorbance spectra for the TiO2 powders and Au/TiO2 powders were collected over the wavelength range 220–1400nm on a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer fitted with an integrating sphere attachment. BaSO4 powder was used as a reference. TEM images were collected using a TECNAI 12 transmission electron microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 120kV. Powder samples were dispersed in absolute ethanol and then 1μL of the resulting dispersion was placed on carbon coated copper TEM grids for analysis. XRF data were taken on a Siemens SRS3000 spectrometer. Data reduction used Siemens SPECTRA 3000 software. Samples were analysed directly as powders supported on Mylar films. Powder XRD patterns were taken on a PANalytical Empyrean diffractometer equipped with a Cu anode X-ray tube and a curved graphite filter monochromator. XRD data were collected from 2θ =10–90° (step 0.02°, scan rate 2° min−1) using Cu Kα X-rays (λ =1.5418Å, 40mA, 40kV). Anatase, brookite and rutile crystallite sizes (L) were determined from the powder XRD data using the Scherrer equation and line-widths of the anatase (101) reflection at 2θ =25.3°, the brookite (121) reflection at 2θ =30.8° and rutile (110) reflection at 2θ =27.4°, respectively [28,40]. The rutile:anatase ratio in P25 TiO2 was determined according to the method described by Ding et al. [44]. (1) % Rutile = 1 [ 1 + 0.8 I A / I R ] × 100 where I A is the peak intensity for the anatase (101) reflection, and I R is the peak intensity for the rutile (110) reflection. XPS data were collected using a Kratos Axis UltraDLD equipped with a hemispherical electron energy analyser and an analysis chamber of base pressure ∼1×10−9 Torr. Spectra were excited using monochromatic Al Kα X-rays (1486.69eV), with the X-ray source operating at 150W. Samples were gently pressed into thin pellets of ∼0.1mm thickness for the analyses. A charge neutralisation system was used to alleviate sample charge build-up during analysis. Survey scans were collected at a pass energy of 80eV over the binding energy range 1200–0eV, whilst core level scans were collected with a pass energy of 20eV. The spectra were calibrated against the C 1s signal at 285.0eV from adventitious hydrocarbons. Ti L-edge and O K-edge NEXAFS data were collected on the soft X-ray Beamline at the Australian Synchrotron. NEXAFS data were taken in the drain current mode at an analysis chamber pressure of ∼1×10−10 Torr. The drain current data were normalised against a current measured simultaneously on a gold mesh in the beamline to eliminate potential spectral artefacts caused by fluctuations in the beam intensity whilst scanning. The measurements were carried out in high resolution (HR) mode by increasing the photon energies in steps of 0.05 or 0.1eV. EXAFS analyses were carried out on beamline BL01B1 at the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (SPring-8). The storage ring was operated at 8GeV with a ring current of 44–65mA for the duration of the experiments. Transmission mode measurements were taken over the Au LIII-edge (11.7–13.3keV) region using a double crystal Si(111) monochromator. Samples were pressed into 1.5mm thick pellets of 7mm diameter for the analysis. N2 physisorption isotherms were determined at liquid nitrogen temperature (77K) using a Micromeritics Tristar 3000 instrument. Specific surface areas were calculated from the N2 adsorption data according to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method using P/P o values in the range 0.05–0.2 [45]. Cumulative pore volumes and pore diameters were calculated from the adsorption isotherms by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method [46]. Samples were degassed at 100°C under vacuum for 1h prior to the N2 physisorption measurements. Photoluminescence measurements were performed in air at room temperature using a Perkin–Elmer LS-55 Luminescence Spectrometer. Samples were excited at 310nm and photoluminescence spectra were recorded over a range of 330–600nm using a standard photomultiplier."
7,Photocatalytic hydrogen production tests,"2.6 Photocatalytic hydrogen production tests Photocatalytic hydrogen production tests on the Au/TiO2 photocatalysts and the bare TiO2 supports were carried out in a tubular pyrex reactor (105mL volume). Photocatalyst (6.5mg) was placed in the reactor and flushed under a N2 flow for 30min to remove oxygen. Then, 20mL of a 10vol.% alcohol–90vol.% water mixture (alcohols tested were methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol) was injected into the reactor through a rubber septum and the resulting photocatalyst dispersion briefly sonicated then stirred continuously for 1h in the dark (no UV excitation). A 1mL sample of the headspace gas was taken to confirm that no hydrogen formed by dark reactions, after which the reactor was exposed to UV light supplied from a Spectroline model SB-100P/F lamp (100W, 365nm) at a distance of 10cm from the reactor. The photon flux at the sample was approximately 6.5mWcm−2. Hydrogen evolution was monitored by taking gas headspace samples (1mL) at 20min intervals and injecting these into a Shimadzu GC 2014 equipped with a TCD detector and Carboxen-1010 plot capillary column (L×I.D. 30m×0.53mm, average thickness 30μm). H2 evolved was quantified against an external calibration curve of peak area versus moles of H2. Photocatalytic tests for each sample were carried out in triplicate."
8,Results and discussion,
9,TiO2 support characterisation,"3.1 TiO2 support characterisation Fig. S1 shows powder X-ray diffraction patterns for the five different TiO2 supports used in this study. The data confirm that the anatase SG, anatase HT, brookite and rutile HT samples were all pure, single phase titanias. The P25 TiO2 contained both anatase and rutile, with the anatase phase being dominant in accordance with the manufacturers’ specifications (6:1 anatase:rutile by weight). Crystallite sizes were estimated from the linewidths of the anatase (101), rutile (110) or brookite (121) reflections, using the Scherrer equation. Results are summarised in Table 1 , along with other important optical and physico-chemical data for the TiO2 supports. Ti L-edge and O K-edge NEXAFS measurements were used as a further tool for discriminating the anatase, brookite and rutile supports. As outlined in Section 1, the three TiO2 polymorphs are constructed from TiO6 octahedra, but differ in the connectivity of the octahedra. The octahedra are the subject of Jahn-Teller distortions due to bonding and crystal packing effects in the solid state, which changes the crystal field about the Ti4+ centres and energy levels of the unoccupied Ti 3d states. Ti-L edge NEXAFS spectra for P25 TiO2, anatase HT, brookite and rutile HT are shown in Fig. 1 (a). Data for anatase SG support were identical to those shown for anatase HT support and thus excluded. The Ti L-edge spectra show two sets of peaks, denoted L3 and L2, and separated by ∼5.8eV which is equivalent to the spin orbit splitting between the occupied Ti 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 states in TiO2. The L3-edge (Ti 2p3/2 →Ti 3d) and L2-edge (Ti 2p1/2 →Ti 3d) features each show two sublevels (t2g and eg) which arise from crystal-field splitting caused by the octahedral ligand fields about the Ti4+ cations [47]. The pre-edge peaks are assigned to the particle–hole coupling between a 2p63d0 ground and 2p53d1 final-state configuration [47,48]. The main difference between the three TiO2 polymorphs was seen in the eg feature at the L3 edge, which is split into two unresolved components (i.e. dz 2 and dx 2−y 2 states). The eg levels have orbitals which are directed towards the oxygens. For anatase, the dz 2 peak is more intense than the dx 2−y 2 peak, whereas for rutile the relative peak intensities are reversed. This change in the relative intensity of the dz 2 and dx 2−y 2 peaks on going from anatase to rutile is explained by distortion of the Ti4+ site from D2h (in anatase) to D2d (in rutile). For brookite, the dz 2 and dx 2−y 2 peaks have similar intensities. These observations are in good accord with Ti L-edge data reported for mineral and synthetic titanias [47,49–51]. The Ti L-edge spectrum of P25 (85% anatase, 15% rutile) agreed with expectations, being effectively the weighted sum of the anatase and rutile spectra. The O K-edge NEXAFS spectra for all the TiO2 polymorphs showed two intense peaks between 530 and 537eV, separated by 2.6–2.7eV (Fig. 1(b)]. These features can readily be assigned to O 1s→Ti 3d type transitions involving unoccupied Ti 3d–O 2p hybrid orbitals [52,53], with the two peaks arising from the t2g and eg states of the Ti4+ octahedral field. Anatase, brookite and rutile differ in their spectral features at photon energies between 538 and 550nm, which involve transitions from O 1s to O 2p-Ti 4sp hybrid states (O 1s→3a1g and 4t1u orbitals of TiO2) [53–55]. This region can be used to “fingerprint” the individual polymorphs. The O K-edge spectrum of P25 was the weighted sum of the anatase and rutile O K-edge spectra."
10,Au/TiO2 photocatalyst characterisation,"3.2 Au/TiO2 photocatalyst characterisation Fig. 2 (a) shows a digital photograph of the 5 different 1.5wt.% Au/TiO2 photocatalysts prepared using P25, anatase SG, anatase HT, brookite and rutile HT supports. All Au/TiO2 photocatalysts displayed a distinctive purple colour characteristic of nanocrystalline Au0 on TiO2, though the intensity and shade of the purple colour varied considerably depending on the support. The purple colour is due to the localised surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the supported Au nanoparticles, the wavelength of which is almost independent of Au particle size in the range 3–12nm, but is very sensitive to the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium [56–60]. Thus, it is not surprising that the Au/TiO2 photocatalysts exhibited different optical responses. Au particle shape and strength of the metal–support interaction are also important, and explored in detail below. Fig. 2(b)–(e) shows UV–Vis absorbance spectra and Tauc plots for the Au/TiO2 photocatalysts and their bare TiO2 supports. All supports showed intense absorption below 410nm, due to band gap excitation in TiO2. Band gap energies determined from the Tauc plots were P25 (E g =3.16eV), anatase SG and anatase HT (E g =3.18–3.23eV), brookite (E g =3.26eV) and rutile (E g =3.00eV). These values were all in excellent accord with previous literature reports for the P25 and the individual TiO2 polymorphs [23,24,60]. For the Au/TiO2 photocatalysts, an intense LSPR absorption (Au 5d→6sp transitions) was seen that extended from UV–NIR wavelengths, with a maximum centred between 560 and 590nm. Au LSPR wavelengths and absorbances for the different samples are listed in Table 1. For unsupported spherical Au nanoparticles of a particular size in solution, the LSPR redshifts linearly with increasing solvent refractive index [61]. Reported refractive indices for mineral anatase, brookite and rutile are 2.49, 2.58 and 2.61, respectively [60]. Thus for a constant Au nanoparticle size on these supports, a redshift in the LSPR could be expected on going from Au/anatase to Au/brookite to Au/rutile. Indeed, the Au/rutile LSPR is predicted to be ∼40nm higher than that of Au/anatase at the same Au nanoparticle size [20,62]. However, the fact that no such dependence of the Au LSPR maxima on the dielectric properties of the support was observed here suggests that other factors, such as Au particle shape and bonding interaction with the support were more influential. We examine these factors below. TEM images for P25 TiO2 and the 1.5wt.% Au/TiO2 photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . All images were taken at the same magnification to allow direct comparison of the samples regarding the relative size and size distribution of the TiO2 crystallites and supported Au nanoparticles. Fig. 4 shows higher resolution TEM images for the Au/TiO2 photocatalysts, and provides more precise information concerning the bonding interaction of the individual Au nanoparticles with each TiO2 support. Mean Au particle sizes determined from the TEM images are listed in Table 1, and ranged between 5 and 10nm (the mean Au sizes are the average of measurements performed on >50 individual Au nanoparticles). For Au/P25, Au/anatase and Au/brookite, the Au nanoparticles were mainly spherical with contact angles greater than 100° on the TiO2 surface. For Au/rutile HT, the contact angles were typically less than 100° and the particle shape is more lozenge-like suggesting the metal-support interaction (MSI) for Au with rutile is stronger than that of Au with the other polymorphs. The rutile HT support exposed a high proportion of (110) planes. A previous study by Bae et al. [63] demonstrated that Pt nanoparticles have a high affinity for rutile (110) faces. Hence, by analogy, we conclude that Au nanoparticles also adsorb strongly on rutile (110) surfaces, resulting in non-spherical Au particle shapes. A further important observation made for the all Au/TiO2 samples, and especially Au/P25, was the preferential location of the Au nanoparticles on interparticle heterojunctions. Such heterojunctions are known to be catalytic “hot spots”, and the preference of Au nanoparticles for such heterojunctions has important implications for the photocatalytic activity of Au/TiO2, as we explore below. Collectively the data in Figs. 2–4 and Table 1 enable some meaningful conclusions to be drawn regarding the optical properties of the Au/TiO2 photocatalysts. The Au/P25, Au/anatase HT and Au/brookite photocatalysts all exhibit quite spherical Au nanoparticle shapes, and accordingly gave symmetrical Au LSPR features (Fig. 2) at similar wavelengths (560, 563 and 573nm, respectively). For these three photocatalysts, the intensity of the LSPR feature decreased in the order Au/brookite>Au/P25>Au/anatase, reflecting a corresponding decrease in the mean Au nanoparticle size (10nm, 6nm and 5nm, respectively). For Au colloids in solution, the dependence of the LSPR intensity on the Au particle size is well established [64], and appears to translate to supported Au nanoparticle systems also (the Au loading by XRF was the same for all Au/TiO2 samples and so the intensity differences are not simply the result of different Au loadings). The LSPR feature for the Au/anatase SG photocatalyst was much broader and red-shifted compared to the Au/anatase HT photocatalyst (Fig. 2(c)), and consistent with the atypical grey-purple colour of that particular sample (Fig. 2(a)). Since Au/anatase SG and Au/anatase HT have similar mean Au particle sizes (7 and 5nm, respectively), the differences in their absorption spectra must be due to factors other than Au particle size. One plausible explanation is that in the Au/anatase SG sample, the individual Au nanoparticles differ considerably in the extent of their contact with the anatase support. If the Au nanoparticles interact with multiple TiO2 crystallites, and to different extent (the anatase SG support had a far broader anatase crystallite size distribution than anatase HT), then this could broaden/redshift the Au LSPR signal appreciably due to the high refractive index of TiO2 and the sensitivity of the LSPR to the surrounding dielectric medium. For the Au/rutile sample, the LSPR feature was distinctly asymmetric on the long wavelength side of the LSPR peak maximum, which can be rationalised in terms of the lozenge-like Au nanoparticle shape and the non-equivalence of transverse and longitudinal LSPRs [64]. XRD patterns for the Au/TiO2 photocatalysts (Fig. 5 ) were very similar to those of the bare TiO2 supports (Fig. S1), confirming that Au deposition had no effect on the TiO2 supports in terms of phase composition or mean crystallite size. Additional very weak and broad peaks could be discerned in the XRD patterns of the Au/TiO2 photocatalysts, which were consistent with the presence of supported Au nanoparticles possessing a fcc structure similar to the Au reference powder. The Au(111) and Au(200) reflections at 2θ =38.2° and 44.4°, respectively, were the most conspicuous of the Au peaks. XPS and Au L3-edge EXAFS were used to probe the speciation of Au on the surface of the Au/TiO2 photocatalysts, in particular to confirm the complete reduction of Au(III) species, such as initially deposited Au(OH)3− x Cl x or Au(OH)4− x Cl x −, to Au0. Near surface region chemical compositions, including Au:Ti atom ratios, determined for the Au/TiO2 photocatalysts from XPS survey spectra are shown in Table 1. The quantification procedure used peak areas for the Ti 2p, O 1s, C 1s and Au 4f regions and appropriate instrument-modified Scofield cross sections. The C 1s signal originates from adventitious hydrocarbons. The O:Ti ratio determined for the bare TiO2 supports and Au/TiO2 photocatalysts ranged between 2.2 and 2.6, as expected for TiO2-based photocatalysts with no surface cleaning before XPS analyses. The Au:Ti atom ratio for the Au/TiO2 photocatalysts was similar (0.019–0.021), corresponding to “XPS-derived” Au loadings of 3.2–4.5wt.%. This is clearly an overestimation of the true Au loading (1.4–1.6wt.% by XRF for all samples, Table 1), which arises from the fact that XPS only probes the top few nanometres of the Au/TiO2 powders where Au is preferentially located. The Ti 2p spectra for the Au/TiO2 photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 6 (a), and show peaks at 458.9eV 464.6eV in a 2:1 area ratio that are readily assigned to photoemission from the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 states of Ti4+ in TiO2 [65]. No differences could be discerned between Ti 2p spectra of the different Au/TiO2 photocatalysts. Au 4f XPS measurements confirmed that metallic Au was the only surface gold species (Fig. 6(b)). The Au 4f spectra for all photocatalysts showed peaks at 83.8 and 87.5eV in a 4:3 area ratio, which are assigned to Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2 peaks, respectively, of metallic Au0 species on TiO2 [65]. The Au 4f peaks were observed at a slightly lower binding energy than the same peaks for a metallic Au foil (Au 4f7/2 =84.0eV, not shown). The small shift could be due to the transfer of electron density from the oxide support to the Au nanoparticles, as has been reported elsewhere [66], or alternatively to the presence of hydroxyl groups which modify the electronic properties of TiO2. Au L3-edge EXAFS examines electronic transitions from Au 2p3/2 core levels into unoccupied d-like states near the Fermi level of the absorbing Au atoms, and is a sensitive probe of coordination environment and next nearest neighbour effects [67,68]. Au L3-edge EXAFS data for 1.5wt.% Au/P25 TiO2 and its uncalcined precursor are shown in Fig. 7 (a). Note that the EXAFS data presented here for the P25-based photocatalysts are representative of data obtained for all the Au/TiO2 photocatalysts and their uncalcined precursors. An intense peak at ∼11919eV was seen in the Au L3 absorbance spectrum of the Au/P25 precursor, which is characteristic for Au3+ species, and arises from Au 2p3/2 →5d electronic transitions [69]. This feature disappeared after sample calcination at 300°C, with the resulting absorption spectrum being characteristic for metallic Au (5d106s1) and almost indistinguishable from the Au foil reference spectrum. The r-space plots for the Au/P25 precursor showed peaks at ∼1.1 and 1.9Å (Fig. 7(b)), which can be assigned to Au–Cl and Au–O bond distances, respectively [69]. The data support the hypothesis that the species formed on TiO2 using the deposition-precipitation with urea method was Au(OH)3− x Cl x or Au(OH)4− x Cl x −, not surprising given that HAuCl4·3H2O was the Au salt used and the final pH in the synthesis was ∼9.5 [69]. The r-space plot for the Au/P25 photocatalyst was dominated by a peak at ∼2.86Å, which is the characteristic Au–Au bond distance in fcc gold [68,69]. The EXAFS transmittance measurements thus provided further confirmation that metallic Au0 was the only Au species on the surface of the Au/TiO2 photocatalysts. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra collected in air for the different TiO2 supports and the Au/TiO2 photocatalysts are presented in Fig. 8 . Each of the bare TiO2 supports gave an intense photoluminescence signal following UV excitation, with the emission maximum wavelength red-shifting in the order brookite<anatase<P25<rutile. This order reflects the relative band gap energies of the supports (E g =3.26, 3.18, 3.16 and 3.00eV, respectively, Table 1). The photoluminescence signal arises from electron de-excitation across the band gap to annihilate holes in the valence band. Deposition of Au nanoparticles on TiO2 was expected to create a rectifying Schottky junction and suppress electron–hole pair recombination, since the Fermi level of supported 5nm Au nanoparticles is −0.27V versus NHE, more positive than the bottom of the conduction bands of anatase (−0.5V versus NHE), brookite (−0.6V versus NHE) and rutile (−0.7V versus NHE). Photo-excited electrons reaching the surface of TiO2 will thus migrate onto the Au nanoparticles, thereby attenuating the PL signal [19,20,32,56]. The experimental data of Fig. 8 supported this argument, with the PL signals for Au/P25, Au/anatase SG, Au/brookite and Au/rutile being 71%, 45%, 63% and 40% weaker, respectively, than the PL intensities of the corresponding bare TiO2 supports. The PL spectrum for Au/anatase HT is not shown, but was attenuated by 48% after Au deposition."
11,Photocatalytic hydrogen production tests,"3.3 Photocatalytic hydrogen production tests The activity of the bare TiO2 supports and the Au/TiO2 photocatalysts for H2 production was evaluated in a range of different alcohol–water mixtures under UV excitation, at a fixed alcohol concentration of 10vol.%. Alcohols used were methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol, and were selected so the effects of alcohol structure (1°, diol or triol) and alcohol physical properties (especially polarity and oxidation potential) on the H2 production rate could be examined. The bare TiO2 supports exhibited very low activities for H2 production in all the alcohol–water mixtures, with the activity of P25 being fractionally superior to the other TiO2 supports. H2 production rates determined for P25 are summarised in Table 2 , and ranged from 1.3 to 1.9mmolg−1 h−1. The low rates observed for the bare TiO2 supports can be attributed to rapid electron–hole recombination following photoexcitation, and the lack of H:H recombination or H+ reduction sites. The Au/TiO2 photocatalysts demonstrated significantly improved H2 production activities (Figs. 9 and 10 , Table 2), with the activity by catalyst mass (in mmolg−1 h−1) decreasing in the order Au/P25 TiO2 >Au/anatase SG≈Au/anatase HT≈Au/brookite>Au/rutile HT in all the alcohol–water mixtures tested. The activity did not change much if normalised to unit area of the semiconductor (Fig. 10(b)), with the activities following the order Au/P25 TiO2 >Au/anatase SG≈Au/brookite>Au/anatase HT≫Au/rutile HT. The fact that the Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst afforded the highest H2 production rates is easily understood in terms of increased charge carrier availability, resulting from synergistic electron and hole transfer across anatase–rutile heterojunctions that was described in Section 1. For photocatalytic H2 production, the presence of Au nanoparticles on anatase–rutile heterojunctions is highly beneficial [32,33], since electrons photo-excited into the conduction bands of rutile or anatase can readily migrate onto the Au nanoparticles which in turn act as cathodic centres for H2 evolution. The lower H2 production activities observed for the Au/anatase SG and Au/brookite photocatalysts, compared to Au/P25, can be rationalised in terms of lower charge carrier concentrations since both anatase and brookite are indirect band gap semiconductors. The activity of the Au/anatase HT sample was low per unit area compared to Au/anatase SG, which can be attributed to the small crystallite size (10–12nm) and low crystallinity in the anatase HT support as seen by XRD (Table 1). For some photocatalysts, small crystallite sizes can be beneficial for photoreactions by reducing diffusion lengths, though small crystallites usually have high defect concentrations which can serve as electron–hole pair recombination sites. The anatase SG supports appear to have a near ideal anatase crystallite size for photocatalytic H2 production. The Au/rutile photocatalyst exhibited the worst performance, reflecting the fact that rutile is a direct band gap semiconductor. Fast electron–hole pair recombination following photo-excitation results in low charge carrier concentrations for photoreactions. Other considerations, such as the faces exposed on the HT rutile sample, comprising mainly rutile (110) and (111), may also contribute to the low activity. Fig. 9 shows that all the Au/TiO2 photocatalysts were stable during the photocatalytic H2 production tests, as evidenced by the strong linearity of H2 production with time in all alcohol–water mixtures. Previous studies of photocatalytic H2 production in the Au/P25, Au/anatase and Au/rutile systems have demonstrated that H2 production rates are independent of Au nanoparticle size in the range 3–12nm, so differences in the activity seen in Figs. 9 and 10 are not due to Au particle size effects (Table 1). Table S1 summarises some photocatalytic H2 production data reported previously by different research groups for Au/TiO2 photocatalysts in alcohol or alcohol–water mixtures under UV or UV–Vis excitation. The data in Table S1 provide a useful benchmark to that reported in the current study. Comparing the data in Fig. 10 and Table 2, it is evident H2 production rates were strongly dependent on the alcohol used as the sacrificial hole scavenger, with the rate decreasing in the general order glycerol>ethylene glycol>methanol>ethanol for all the Au/TiO2 photocatalysts. The Au/P25 photocatalyst afforded the highest rates, 27.9mmolg−1 h−1 in 10vol.% glycerol, 20.9mmolg−1 h−1 in 10vol.% ethylene glycol, 13.5mmolg−1 h−1 in 10vol.% methanol and 9.8mmolg−1 h−1 in 10vol.% ethanol. We determined the H2 production rate for the Au/P25 photocatalyst in pure water to be 0.25mmolg−1 h−1; thus, the addition of the alcohols to water increased the H2 evolution rates by 40–112 times depending on the alcohol. The relative rates in the different alcohol–water mixtures were remarkably similar for each Au/TiO2 photocatalyst, and can be considered independent of the TiO2 polymorph (at least at the alcohol concentration and Au loading used in this study). This is a key finding of the current study. It is of interest to examine the relative H2 production rates in terms of the structure and physical properties of the different alcohols. Table 3 summarises key physical properties for the four alcohols. Fig. 11 shows plots of H2 production for each Au/TiO2 photocatalyst versus selected physical properties of the alcohols. In all cases, reasonable linear relationships can be established, the basis for which we discuss below. The photoreforming of the alcohols can be represented by the following general equation [21]: (2) C x H y O z + ( 2 x - z ) H 2 O → x CO 2 + n H + + ne - where x, y and z are the number of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms, respectively, in the alcohol and n is the number of protons or electrons liberated. In aqueous media, the photoreaction will proceed via the formation of alpha hydroxyl radicals, which have been identified previously on TiO2 by EPR [18,70]. (3) RCH 2 - OH a + h + ( VB ) → RCH . - OH a + H + (4) R 2 CH - OH a + h + ( VB ) → R 2 C . - OH a + H + By this mechanism, it is easy to envisage why the presence of α-H atoms on the alcohol is critical to achieving high rates of H2 production (a study we performed using tertiary butanol as the sacrificial hole scavenger, which has no α-H, gave a low H2 production rate of 1.2mmolg−1 h−1 for Au/P25). By plotting H2 production rates versus the number of α-H atoms or number of OH groups on the alcohol, reasonable linear relationships were obtained for all the Au/TiO2 photocatalysts (Fig. 11(a) and (b), respectively.) Bowker and co-workers previously identified the importance of α-H adjacent to the OH groups as being important for achieving high rates of H2 production in the Pd/TiO2 system [19]. Considering the physical adsorption of the alcohols and alpha hydroxyl radicals on the TiO2 surface, the interaction of lone pairs on the OH groups with unoccupied Ti 3d states is important. This largely explains the dependence of the hydrogen production rates on the number of OH groups on the alcohols [Fig. 11(b)], and further pointed to a probable relationship between the H2 production rates and alcohol polarity. Fig. 11(c) confirmed the existence of a relationship for all Au/TiO2 photocatalysts, in accord with the findings of Yang et al. for the Pt/TiO2 system [36]. A similar relationship could potentially be drawn between the H2 production rates and alcohol polarisability (Table 3). In Fig. 11(a)–(c), methanol showed slightly different behaviour to the other alcohols, affording a H2 production rate lower than expected. C1 chemistry often differs from that of C2, C3, and longer chain organics, and that appears to be the case here. For methanol, photocatalytic oxidation to formaldehyde then CO may have partially poisoned the photocatalyst surface, with the kinetics of the photocatalytic water-gas shift reaction (CO+H2O→CO2 +H2) impacting the overall rate of H2 production [71]. Using standard Gibbs free energies of formation (Δf G o) of each alcohol, we calculated the standard oxidation potentials (E ox o) of methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol (see Table S2). The calculations gave values of 0.016, 0.084, 0.009 and 0.004V versus NHE, respectively, all significantly lower than the oxidation potential of water (1.23V versus NHE). Hence, during photocatalysis in alcohol–water systems, the alcohols will be preferentially oxidised, though water will also be oxidised through direct water splitting and alcohol photo-reforming. Glycerol and ethylene glycol afforded the highest H2 production rates for all Au/TiO2 photocatalysts (Table 2), which is not surprising given they have the lowest oxidation potentials, making them the best sacrificial hole scavengers. According to current theories of electron transfer reactions between an electron donor and valence band holes in a semiconductor [72], the experimental rate constant (k exp) for such reactions follows the relation (5) k exp ∝ exp - ( E VB TiO 2 o - E ox o ) / RT where E VB TiO 2 o and E ox o are the valence band potential of TiO2 and the oxidation potential of the donor (water of alcohol), respectively. If electron transfer from water or alcohols to TiO2 was the overall rate limiting step in photocatalytic H2 production over M/TiO2 surfaces, then H2 production rates could be expected to correlate with exp - E VB TiO 2 o - E ox o . In Fig. 11(d) we have plotted H2 production rates against the exponential of energy change for the alcohol oxidation reaction; [exp(−ΔE o)], where Δ E o = E VB TiO 2 o - E ox o . The analysis confirms a linear relationship between the H2 production rates and exp(−ΔE o) for all the Au/TiO2 photo-catalysts (data for ethanol were excluded since it did not have a O:C ratio=1 like the other alcohols). We can conclude that the larger the potential gap between the TiO2 valence band (2.7V versus NHE for anatase) and E ox o, the higher the H2 production rate. Further, the data suggest that electron transfer reactions between the alcohols (or water) and valence band holes of TiO2 may be rate limiting in H2 production on Au/TiO2 surfaces. Currently we are attempting to quantify other products formed during the H2 production tests, including O2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6 and CH3CHO in the case of the ethanol–water system, to better understand the photoreaction mechanism(s) and also to determine the relative contributions of water splitting and alcohol photoreforming to the high H2 yields reported here. We are also extending the current study by conducting photocatalytic tests under visible and full solar excitation, to determine the extent to which the plasmonic effect can enhance H2 production rates [70,73]."
12,Conclusion,"The activity of Au/TiO2 photocatalysts for H2 production in alcohol–water mixtures under UV excitation is strongly dependent on the polymorphic composition of the TiO2 support. Au/TiO2 photocatalyst activity decreased in the order P25 (anatase+rutile)>anatase≈brookite≫rutile for each alcohol–water system tested, which can be rationalised in terms of the relative charge carrier concentrations in each TiO2 support under UV irradiation. Au nanoparticles demonstrate a preference for interparticle heterojunctions, and reduce electron–hole pair recombination rates in TiO2 by accepting photo-excited electrons from the conduction band and creating cathodic sites for H2 evolution, thereby explaining their positive role in promoting H2 generation on each TiO2 support. H2 production rates were highest for the Au/P25 photocatalyst (27.9mmolg−1 h−1 in 10vol.% glycerol), and decreased with the alcohol in the order glycerol>ethylene glycol>methanol>ethanol. For all the Au/TiO2 photocatalysts, correlations could be established between the H2 production rate and key physical properties of the alcohols, including the number of α-H or OH groups on the alcohol, alcohol polarity and more importantly on exp - E VB TiO 2 o - E ox o as suggested from electron transfer theory."
