0,Introduction,"The need for concrete with a high compressive strength is increasing day by day [1]. However, the production of concrete with high resistance causes a large amount of cement needed [2]. High cement usage leads to high concrete production costs and carbon emissions with environmental drawbacks [3]. Minerals such as silica fume [4], fly ash [5] and blast furnace slag [6] were added to the concrete to eliminate these disadvantages. It has been determined that the usage of cement in concrete is partially reduced by mineral admixtures [7] and improves its properties such as workability [8] and carbonation depth [9]. Although chemical and mineral admixtures cause some improvements in the concrete, the fact that concrete has low splitting strength, fracture toughness and chemical resistance is still to be developed [10]. The usage of fibers within the concrete is used for high fracture toughness, splitting and bending strength, chemical resistance, energy absorbing ability and preventing cracks in the structure [1,11,12]. One of the most widely used fibers in concrete is steel fibers and the porosity of concrete increased from 1.31% to 1.09% with the use of steel fibers 0.5% by volume usage, the compressive strength of concrete was increasing by 4.88% while decreasing tensile strength capacity from 2.89% to 0.95% [13]. An improvement ratio of 20.54% was provided in the tensile strength at 28 days with the use of steel fibers 0.66% by volume [14]. The average impact toughness index of self-compacting concrete was increased by 18.8% when 1.0% steel fiber by volume are included to the mix [15]. However, steel fibers make heavier the concrete and they are unsuitable for reinforced concrete structures exposed to aggressive environmental conditions such as sewage, seaside, port and pier [16,17]. The second most commonly used fiber is basalt fiber and improves the mechanical and bending strength [18] and thermal stability [16] of concrete (19% improvement rate with 24 mm length and 0.5% by volume) but production cost of basalt fiber is quite high. It has also been determined that polypropylene fibers increase the water permeability, carbonation depth and durability of concrete [19,20], but are less effective on other properties of concrete than other fibers [21,22]. Glass fiber reinforced fibers [23] and carbon fibers [24], among other most commonly used fibers, have been used in the production of concrete with high mechanical strength [25], resistant to aggressive environmental conditions [26]. At the same time, the use of hybrid fibers such as basalt-polypropylene [27], polypropylene-steel [21], basalt-glass fiber [28], carbon fiber-steel fiber [24] has become widespread, i.e. researchers have used two or more fibers simultaneously [16] to resolve the drawbacks of the fibers used alone. However, the biggest disadvantage of the hybrid fibers usage in concrete is that high dosage of use, the production cost and the fibers are added to the mixture separately, not in the form of a composite. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is becoming increasingly attractive as they have a higher shear and splitting strength than polypropylene fibers and have eight-times cheaper production cost than polyethylene fibers [29]. Polyvinyl alcohol is also an important material for the construction industry because it is environmentally friendly [30,31]. The most preferred fiber type for the mortars that has proven to provide high tensile strength [32] production, is PVA fibers [33]. Fiber-reinforced mortar (FRM) is a promising material in terms of the ability to absorb high energy [34], to avoid multiple cracks [33], to have a tensile strength of 4–6 MPa [35] and sustainable building materials production [36]. PVA, which is an important alternative for mortars and engineered cementitious composites (ECC), is generally used in bulk “powdered form” at a maximum of 3% of instead of cement by mass [37]. Another type of usage of PVA in cement mortar is in the form of fiber which gives concrete some advantages and makes some features worse. The PVA fiber-reinforced concrete has a smaller corrosion area [38], a relatively high modulus of elasticity [39], a tensile strength capacity [40], a higher workability, water retention ability, and a lower compressive strength [37,39,41–47] and drying shrinkage [48] compared to the control concrete. To overcome these disadvantages, glass fiber [49], steel fiber [10], metakaolin [22], polypropylene [44,50], and polyethylene [38] were used for mortar manufacturing with PVA. Compressive strength of mortar was increased with the use of steel fibers reinforced PVA are supported by basalt fibers [31] and nano-silica [10,16], but again one of the biggest disadvantages is that the steel fibers have a corrosive structure under aggressive environmental conditions, the cost of basalt fiber production and the materials such as nano silica are carcinogenic because they contain spherical silica. Graphene oxide (GO) with its superior mechanical properties, high hydrophilicity, high dispersion rate in water and non-toxicity manufacturing availability in mass amounts have found large number of applications in building industries [51]. Silver nano particles (AG) has also unique properties such as antibacterial effect, synthesis with non-toxicity and environmentally friendly production process [52]. Therefore, GO and AG may be a promising alternative to composite with PVA. When the literature related to the hybrid fibers reinforced mortars is examined, the novelties of this work can be summarized as follows. (1) Analyzing of the mechanical, thermal, electrical and durability properties of PVA/GO, PVA/AG and PVA/GO/AG hybrid fibers reinforced mortars. (2) Uncover the relationship between the PVA/GO, PVA/AG, and PVA/GO/AG hybrid fibers’ properties such as hardness, contact angle, surface roughness and mortar properties. (3) Unlike the conventional usage in the literature, fibers are added to the mixture in the form of a composite. (4) Investigation of the source of variation in nanoparticles blended hybrid fibers reinforced mortars. In order to exploit these useful properties of nanoparticles blended PVA reinforced hybrid fibers, researchers have been investigating the effects of type and dosage of fibers on several quality criteria–especially mechanical properties –of mortars. Researchers have created mixture designs of PVA in both powder and fiber forms, with or without nanomaterials, and examined their mortar properties. The results of some of these studies can be seen in Table 1 ."
1,Materials and method,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Nanoparticles blended hybrid fibers: Silver nitrate as precursor (≥99.5%), starch as a capping agent from potato and hydrogen peroxide (34.5–36.5%) was supplied from Sigma Aldrich. Polyvinyl alcohol fully hydrolyzed (Mw~145,000), graphite (<50 μm), potassium permanganate (extra pure), sodium hydroxide pellets used for pH adjustments (NaOH,> 99%), D (+) – Glucose as a reducing agent (anhydrous for biochemistry), sulfuric acid (95–97%), ortho phosphoric acid (85%) was obtained from Merck Millipore. In order to synthesis GO and AG [52], improved Hummers' method [64,65] and a kind of redox reaction using glucose was selected as a green solution [66]. Detail information about synthesis and characterization of GO [52] and AG can be seen in the previous study [64,65]. Fiber-reinforced mortars: In the experiments, CEM I 42.5 R type Portland cement, silica sand, fly ash, superplasticizer and water were used as component. In addition, the amount of cement, silica sand, fly ash, chemical additives were kept constant. However, the amount of PVA fiber was taken as varying in order to examine the effect of fiber on some properties of concrete. Portland cement has Blaine fineness of 3312 cm2/g and specific gravity of 3.1. The characteristic properties of Portland cement are presented in Table 2 . The chemical components of fly ash that was used in Class of F as pozzolanic material are also presented in Table 2. Silica sand was also used as aggregate in maximum size of 1.0 mm. Sika Viscocrete SF-18 high performance plasticizing concrete admixture was used in the mixtures in order to increase the workability of fresh concrete at a rate of 0.6% of cement weight. Concrete admixture was added to the mixture by mixing with water."
3,Experimental procedure,"2.2 Experimental procedure Nanoparticles blended hybrid fibers: Solution casting method was used to produce composite films 12 or 36 mg of GO was mixed in 20 ml distilled water for 3 h with the use of an ultrasonic probe. 2.4 g of PVA was dissolved in 80 ml distilled water at 80 °C for 1 h, using a magnetic stirrer. After 3 h, the resulting GO solution was mixed with the PVA solution and 118.1 mg of glycerine. After mixing for a 1 h, 45 ml of solution was poured into a Petri dish. Finally, the “PVA/GO composites” is came into being by drying at room temperature for 3 days and the PVA/GO hybrid fibers were obtained by cutting 1 cm in length and 1 mm in width [67]. For “PVA/GO/AG composites, 2.4 g PVA was dissolved in 80 ml distilled water at 80 °C for 1 h using a magnetic stirrer. 12 mg of GO in 20 ml distilled water and 20 ml of AG suspension (solid: liquid ratios 1:15) were added to the PVA solution and 118.1 mg of glycerine was added to the mixture. After mixing for a 1 h, 45 ml of solution was poured into a Petri dish. Finally, the “PVA/GO/AG composites” is came into being by drying at room temperature for 3 days and the PVA/GO/AG hybrid fibers were obtained by cutting 1 cm in length and 1 mm in width [67] (Fig. 1 ). Fiber-reinforced mortars: After mixing the cement and fly ash for a 1 min, ground fine silica sand is added to the mixture at a low speed to obtain the sand-binder mixture. After stirring for about 1 min, water and 2/3 of the plasticizer are added to the dry cementitious material and stirring is continued for another 5 min. The remaining mixture of water and superplasticizer gradually poured into the mixture to achieve a mixture of suitable flowability. Finally, nanoparticles blended hybrid cutting-fibers were slowly added and mixed for another 5 min to ensure homogeneous dispersion. 48 h later, the specimens were removed from molds and cured under lime-saturated water at 20 °C for 28 days. When the literature is examined, it is seen that the volume fractions of substituted fiber instead of cement vary among 0.5%–2%. Therefore, considering that the main aim of this study is to analyze the effects of the nanoparticles blended fiber type and the fiber properties on the mortars, the fiber type was selected as the only variable while the fiber volume content and components of mortars was kept as constant. This method has been reported by other researchers to identify the effect of hybrid fiber clearly [54,68]. In this study, three types of mortars were designed using hybrid fibers containing GO and AG nanoparticles. Fiber free mortar was also produced as a control experiment. The details of mixture proportion for all tested specimens are summarized in Table 3 . Three specimens were prepared and tested for each type of FRM."
4,Testing methods,"2.3 Testing methods Nanoparticles blended hybrid fibers: FTIR (Fourier Transmittance Infrared Spectroscopy), Thermo DXR Raman spectroscopy, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analyses was used to characterize the synthesized composite films. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Nano Magnetics Instruments AFM Plus and optical microscopy (Nikon SMZ800 stereoscopic zoom microscope) was used to identify the surface roughness and surface morphology of composite films. Synthesized film thicknesses were measured by micrometer at 5 points and average film thickness was determined. The hardness and elastic modulus of the hybrid nanocomposites were determined using a Berkovich-tip indenter, with a 0.1–400 mN nanoindentation load range [69–72]. In order to prevent the film's mechanical properties from the effect of the substrate, the maximum depth of indentation was fixed at 200 nm, which was less than one-tenth to one-seventh of the total thickness [71]. The load and unload times were both 10 s, and the displacement speed of the indenter was 20 nm/s. Mechanical tests was repeated six times on each hybrid nanocomposite film for the determining of durability and flexibility of thin films. Contact angles of the composite film samples were measured by an Attension theta-type tensiometer. The contact angle of composite films is important for determining the surface hydrophility and hydrophobicity that can be used in solar cells, periscopes and lenses, and other biological and environmental applications [73,74]. TA Instruments SDT Q600 device was used to determine the weight loss of the composite films using Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) analysis. Fiber-reinforced mortars: Three 50 mm cubic and 25 × 25 × 50 mm prismatic specimens were produced for all experiments. Compressive strength tests were performed on the cubic specimens according to the ASTM C109. The compression strength tests were carried out in a fully automated press machine which has the capacity for 200 kN. Electrical resistance and its durability indicator counterpart, electrical resistivity, are parameters that are commonly related to transport properties of concrete. Electrical resistivity of FRM was measured by the two probe method in room temperature with the direct current (DC) [75]. In the measurements, the water saturated composite sample in size of 50 × 25 × 25 mm is placed between two parallel metal plates with moist sponge contacts at the interfaces to ensure proper electrical connection. The resistivity of composites between electrodes was measured on the specimens. Electrical resistivity of composites was calculated with Eq. (1) as follows: (1) δ = R.A/L Where δ is the electrical resistivity as Ω*m; the internal electrode distance is symbolized as L (m); the electrode conductive area is defined as S (m2) and R is the measured resistance as Ω. In mortars, water absorption value plays important role on electrical resistivity which is an indicator of durability under environmental effects. Therefore, water absorption values of FRM was determined according to the EN 12390-7 [75]. Charpy method based on potential energy in which a large mass free falls onto specimens [76], was selected as a type of impact test of FRM to assess the resistance of the material to breakage [77]. The Charpy test was applied to determine the fracture energy of the samples (Fig. 2 ). For the experiment, a U-notch with a width of 1.5 mm and a height of 10 mm was made on the 50 × 25 × 25 mm specimens. Charpy experiment is based on the principle of finding the required energy of the sample under dynamic loading by using potential differences. The value obtained by dividing this potential energy found by the fracture area is called fracture toughness. The fracture toughness of the samples was determined by equation (2). (2) K=U/A=(G(h0-h1))/A Where, K, fracture toughness (kN/m); U, potential energy (j); A, cross-sectional area (m2); G, weight of the pendulum (kN); h0, initial height of the pendulum (m) and h1, final height of the pendulum (m) after the impact. The following test procedure and importance of FRM was summarized as Table 4 ."
5,Nanoparticles blended hybrid fibers,"Chemical structures of composite films were investigated by FTIR, Raman, Optical microscopy and AFM analysis. Neat PVA films show severe peaks at 1087 cm−1 are associated with C–C stretching alcohol, 2900 cm−1 are associated with CH2 asymmetric stretching, 1320 cm−1 related to C–O stretching alcohols, 1720 cm−1 related to CO stretch carbonyl groups and 3260 cm−1 are associated with OH stretching from hydrogen bond. After the addition of GO, a new band appears at 1625 cm−1 caused by the stretching CO of the primary amide or aromatic CC stretching [78–81]. Decreasing in the intensity of oxygen-containing groups in FTIR spectrum can be attributed to the binding of the OH groups in the PVA to graphene oxide (Fig. 3 A). Comparing with the FTIR spectra of neat PVA and PVA/GO modified with AG composite, the intensity of the oxygen-containing bands was further reduced. The reason for this is that oxygen was absorbed to the silver surface. Moreover, the band intensity at 1100 cm−1 is weakened due to the reaction between N and Ag atoms. Raman spectroscopy was also used to characterize the structural changes in composite films. For the neat PVA, the peak at 1430 cm−1 is attributing to the stretching vibration of C–H in PVA molecules. After the addition of GO, a two district band appears at 1350 cm−1 and 1590 cm−1 correspond to the D and G band, respectively [82]. The presence of AG within the composite increased both the D and G band and the 2D band intensity at 2930 cm−1 (Fig. 3B). When the optical microscope images of composites films were analyzed, a slightly agglomeration can be seen in only AG-containing graphene oxide PVA composites (Fig. 3C). The reason for this can be thought to be the electrostatic repulsion force between nanoparticles. But in general, it can be said that the nanoparticles in the PVA are homogeneously dispersed in the matrix. AFM images of the composite films can be used to evaluate surface topology (Fig. 3D). Especially, surface roughness, which is a crucial parameter to characterize thin film properties, was calculated on samples for 1 μm × 1 μm areas (Fig. 3D). To investigate the thermal behavior of composite films, thermogravimetric analysis was used upon heating under a nitrogen atmosphere [83]. Composite film samples of 6 mg were submitted to a heating rate of 10 °C/min using aluminum crucibles and a range of temperature from 25 °C to 600 °C. The films started to decompose around 100–200 °C and the films lost their entire weight at about 400 °C. In order to clarify the differences between the thermal stability of the films, weight losses up to 350 °C were determined (Table 5 ). The mean and standard deviation of the film thickness measured at 5 points were also transferred to Table 5. The mean and standard deviation of hardness, elastic modulus and contact angles of the composite films were calculated at 10 points and can be seen in Table 5."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Hardened ECC,"4.1 Hardened ECC Compressive strength: 28 days compressive strength results of FRM are shown in Fig. 4 . All the specimens containing nanoparticles blended hybrid fibers showed lower 28 days compressive strength than of control experiment at the age of 28 days. By adding 2% of PVA/GO nanoparticles blended hybrid fibers into FRM, the compressive strength decreased from 33.47 MPa to 31.33 MPa. As expected, the loss of compressive strength due to the addition of PVA fibers was reduced by the addition of graphene oxide [36,40]. However, it has been observed that when the amount of graphene oxide in PVA is tripled, the loss of compressive strength increases considerably by 28.44%. This is due to agglomerated graphene oxide particles in the PVA matrix (1.5% graphene oxide was used instead of PVA by weight). The poor dispersion of GO particles lead to the formation of GO agglomerations around grains of cement as a result of van der Waals force [84] and more than enough GO usage forms a barrier between the cement paste and water to prevent hydration reaction. A similar situation has been true of PVA/GO12/AG hybrid nanofibers. If the dispersed AG having high stability is directly incorporated into the matrix, agglomeration is avoidable, similar to the PVA/GO12 sample. However, the usage of graphene oxide and AG together caused weak repulse forces between nanoparticles. Agglomeration of nanoparticles in PVA matrix (the increase in surface roughness of nanoparticles blended hybrid fibers is an indication of agglomeration, Table 5) and also in cement paste may be caused loss of strength. When the film properties and FRM properties were analyzed, it was observed that FRM compressive strength decreased as the elastic modulus of the films increased (Fig. 4A). In other words, PVA hybrid nano fibers with a high modulus of elasticity did not prevent loss of strength. As illustrated in Fig. 4B, the differences in film thickness do not change the compressive strength pattern. Another important point is that the decrease in contact angle of films has a negative effect on the compressive strength value. This may be because the hydrophilic polymer surface absorbs water on the surface and then polymer releases the trapped water, causing the polymer to shrink [85]. After voids are formed, shrinkage of fibers may cause increases in the total porosity of the concrete system. It can be thought that the compressive strength at 28 days decreases due to the increase in porosity of FRM. Wang et al. [47] were determined a 4.9% reduction in 28-days compressive strength with a 1.5% by volume of PVA fiber when compared with control specimens. In the 28 days compressive strength, % 6.39 decreases were obtained comparing to the control specimen with a 2.0% by volume of PVA/GO12 hybrid nano fibers. This value is important when compared with the control specimen because the loss of 28-days compressive strength is reduced noticeable by the addition of graphene oxide (0.5% by weight instead of PVA). Electrical resistivity: It is known that electrical resistance increases when graphene oxide is added to cementitious composites due to oxygen-containing functional groups. However, the 28 days electrical resistivity decreased by adding graphene oxide-based nanoparticles blended hybrid fibers into FRM (Fig. 5 ). This may be caused by the hydrogen bonds formed between oxygen-containing functional groups in GO and PVA. The electrical resistance of cementitious composites had reduction by 79.09%, 83.05% and 88.14% by substitution of 2% of PVA/GO, PVA/GO36 and PVA/GO12/AG hybrid nanofibers, respectively. Silver nanoparticles, which one of the highest metals in electrical conductivity may be, decreased the electrical resistance of FRM. Especially in self-monitoring concrete production, having a high electrical conductivity is an important parameter. When the film properties and FRM properties were analyzed, it was observed that the differences in contact angle do not affect the electrical resistivity of FRM (Fig. 5A). The electrical resistance of FRM reduces with the decreasing thickness of nanoparticles blended hybrid fibers (Fig. 5B). Wang et al. [47] were also determined a 7.62% reduction in electrical resistivity with a 1.5% by volume of PVA fiber when compared with control specimens. Mosavinejad et al. [55] achieved 24.4% lower electrical resistivity with the addition of 1.2% of PVA by volume. In this study, an 88.13% increment in 28-days electrical resistivity was obtained by PVA/GO12/AG hybrid nanofiber. Although PVA is not electrically conductive, it increases electrical resistance of FRM as it creates micro pores in the cementitious composite. However; in the literature the highest decrement in electrical resistance was reported as 24.4%. In particular, a significant reduction of 88.13% in electrical resistance was achieved by the formation of hydrogen bonding between PVA and GO and the addition of silver nanoparticles to the fiber. Fracture toughness: Fracture toughness of FRM was increased from 5.63 kN*m−1 to 8.29 kN*m−1, which is highest value in selected nanofibers, with the use of PVA/GO12 nanoparticles blended hybrid fibers (Fig. 6 ). Nanoparticles blended hybrid fibers provide high dense matrix and fills the micro-cracks and plays a more important role in improving the fracture toughness. The improvement in such a high fracture toughness value is more likely to result from the nanomaterial properties rather than the air gap created by the fibers. Although there was some increase in other fibers such as PVA/GO36 and PVA/GO12/AG, a value as high as PVA/GO12 could not be reached. The reason for this is that the use of high levels of graphene oxide causes agglomeration and the amount of silver nanoparticles contained in the dispersion is less and the cement becomes more dominant. A similar trend was observed between the change in surface roughness of hybrid nano fibers and fracture toughness of FRM (Fig. 6A). This trend was attributed to the fact that the nanoparticles blended hybrid fibers which have more roughness could interact with the cement paste and prevent initiation and propagation of micro-cracks. Ling et al. [56] observed higher fracture toughness in FRM produced by silicon nanoparticles and PVA than the control specimen, and associated this phenomenon with the fracture energy. They concluded that the bond between PVA and cement paste was taking part of load until fiber was failed or pulled from the matrix and the crack propagation was prevented by the PVA bridging effect. Yu et al. [86] determined that silicon nanoparticles increase deformation capacity of FRM with the usage of PVA. Thus, nanoparticles such as GO and AgNPs blended hybrid fibers could improve the deformation capacity of FRM and they also increase fracture toughness (Fig. 6B). If the hybrid nano fibers are used too much, the poor fluidity in these FRM, also affects toughness negatively (Fig. 6B). It is well known that agglomeration of nanoparticles in PVA matrix or non-uniform distribution of fibers in cement matrix can cause a decrease in fracture toughness [56]. Liu et al. [54] determined the plain concrete bending strength as 3.93 MPa and its toughness at L/600 is 3 N*m. With the addition of 1% of PVA fiber, the concrete bending strength and toughness has been reached at 4.72 MPa and 4.56 N*m. In other words, 20.10% improvement in bending strength and 52% improvement in toughness were achieved with the addition of 1% PVA. With the addition of 1% of steel-fiber, the concrete bending strength and toughness has been reached at 5.48 MPa and 3.44 N*m. Ling et al. [56] obtained an improvement ratio of 54.19% for initiation toughness while a deterioration ratio of 61.37% occurs in slump flow value. Cao et al. [57] improved the ECC fracture toughness by 13.7% with the addition of 0.5% of PVA by volume. With the use of PVA/GO12 hybrid nano fibers in FRM by volume of 2.0%, 47.24% increment in 28-days fracture toughness was obtained. This improvement ratio is also remarkable for inhibition of the growth and propagation of micro-cracks. It should be noted that the incorporation of graphene oxide significantly improves the fracture toughness due to its high surface area and filling effect. It should not be forgotten that although these results are positive for fiber reinforced concrete, they may cause loss of ultimate tensile stress and tensile strain capacity in FRM. Therefore, its reinforcing agent usage for strain hardening cementitious composites needs further analysis. Water absorption: There was a significant increase in the water absorption percentage of cementitious composites compared to the control specimen. It was expected that the addition of nanoparticles blended hybrid fibers would increase the porosity and air content in cementitious composite and increase water absorption percentage (Fig. 7 ). The differences in contact angle do not affect the water absorption of FRM (Fig. 7A). As expected, the percentage of water absorption increased with the increasing the surface roughness of the cementitious composites (Fig. 7B)."
8,Principal component analysis,"4.2 Principal component analysis Three nanoparticles blended hybrid fibers are located in different regions of the axis, which it is an indication that the characteristics of these films differ from each other. Initially, hybrid nanofiber properties were defined by six properties such as surface roughness, weight loss, film thickness, hardness, elastic modulus and contact angle. First and second principal component explains 56.5% and 43.5% of the total variance in nanoparticles blended hybrid fibers (Fig. 8 A). As a consequence of principal component analysis, six dimensions were reduced to three dimensions which are explained 100.0% of total variance. The maximum variability in nanoparticles blended hybrid fibers is caused by surface roughness, elastic modulus, and weight loss and film thickness nanofibers (Fig. 8B). The loading chart also supports that film thickness and elastic modulus is effective on first principal component while surface roughness, contact angle and weight loss is effective on second principal component (Fig. 8C). The weight loss and contact angle are seems positively correlated according to the loading plot. Principal component scores were calculated using Minitab for selected variables that cause the maximum variation in hybrid nanofibers: F i b e r ( P C 1 ) = 0.509 ∗ ( s u r f a c e r o u g h n e s s ) − 0.472 ∗ ( w e i g h t l o s s ) − 0.142 ∗ ( t h i c k n e s s ) + 0.167 ∗ ( e l a s t i c m o d u l u s ) F i b e r ( P C 2 ) = − 0.217 ∗ ( s u r f a c e r o u g h n e s s ) + 0.306 ∗ ( w e i g h t l o s s ) − 0.598 ∗ ( t h i c k n e s s ) + 0.589 ∗ ( e l a s t i c m o d u l u s ) The fact that these coefficients are close to 1 indicates that the factor has a higher effect on the component. For example, surface roughness with 0.509 values and film thickness with −0.598 values is the most effective factor on the first and second principal component, respectively. When the scree plot created for FRM properties is examined, it is observed that the specimens prepared with different hybrid nano fibers exhibit different properties from each other (Fig. 8D) because it is located in different parts of the coordinate system. The first three major components compressive strength, electrical resistance and fracture toughness explain 100% of total FRM variability (Fig. 8E). Electrical resistance and water absorption of FRM is effective on first principal component while compressive strength and fracture toughness is effective on second principal component (Fig. 8F). Principal component scores were calculated using Minitab for selected variables that cause the maximum variation in FRM specimens: E C C ( P C 1 ) = − 0.456 ∗ ( c o m p r e s s i v e s t r e n g t h ) − 0.545 ∗ ( e l e c t r i c a l r e s i s t a n c e ) + 0.430 ∗ ( f r a c t u r e t o u g h n e s s ) E C C ( P C 2 ) = 0.662 ∗ ( c o m p r e s s i v e s t r e n g t h ) − 0.012 ∗ ( e l e c t r i c a l r e s i s t a n c e ) + 0.748 ∗ ( f r a c t u r e t o u g h n e s s ) E C C ( P C 3 ) = − 0.548 ∗ ( c o m p r e s s i v e s t r e n g t h ) + 0.648 ∗ ( e l e c t r i c a l r e s i s t a n c e ) + 0.485 ∗ ( f r a c t u r e t o u g h n e s s ) Coefficients located in these equations show that compressive strength and fracture toughness has a significant effect on FRM variability. Loading graph also shows that the criteria for FRM are not interdependent each other (Fig. 8F)."
9,Bonding effect,"4.3 Bonding effect In addition to the filling effect, the positive effect of the nanoparticles on the properties of the cement pastes should be evaluated in terms of bonding effect. It is an important critical issue fact that intermolecular interactions and bonds increase the mechanical strength and durability of cementitious composites and even give the pastes self-healing ability with autogenous mechanism [87]. It is also known that non-covalent molecular interaction polymers between nanomaterials formed as chemical bonds and physical interaction make an important contribution to move the polymer chains and nanomaterials. This phenomenon happens at molecular and nanoscopic scale is one of the factors in a healing process [88]. It should be noted that one of the reasons for these remarkable recovery rates is molecular interactions and bonds occurring in the hydrated structure. In particular, the hydrogen bonds of PVA with GO's functional groups such as hydroxyl and carboxyl (Fig. 9 A) and the metallic interaction of PVA with the silver nanoparticles are thought to be an important factor in improving the mechanical properties and fracture toughness of the cement pastes (Fig. 9B)."
10,Conclusions,"In contrast to the traditional method used in the literature, in this study, nano material and PVA were produced as composites and then they were made into fibers and replaced into cementitious composites. Thus, it is aimed to improve the composite properties of the nanomaterials by using fewer nanomaterials by taking part in the PVA matrix. In this study, the following results can be drawn from the current results. 1) A remarkable improvement ratio in fracture toughness of 47.25% was obtained using graphene oxide, instead of 0.5% by weight of polyvinyl alcohol and 0.007% by weight of total binder. Such an improvement in fracture toughness, which is a measure of the growth and propagation of micro-cracks that may occur due to physical, chemical, structural or thermal reasons, is important for fiber reinforced concrete. However, it should be noted that aggregation of graphene oxide in the PVA matrix may adversely affect this property. 2) An 88% reduction in electrical resistance was obtained by adding disperse silver nanoparticles to the PVA/GO matrix, which required an additional cost of $ 0.12. This is quite remarkable for the result for smart and multi-functional cementitious composites production for targets such as road decoding, electrostatic prevention, electromagnetic defense and structural health monitoring. 3) An important finding obtained from the study was that the negative effect of using neat PVA fiber on cementitious composites was reduced by the addition of graphene oxide into the PVA matrix. The loss of 28 days compressive strength decreased to 4.9% by the addition of 0.5% graphene into polyvinyl alcohol matrix. 4) The results obtained by the principal component analysis showed that the properties of hybrid nano fibers significantly on cementitious composite properties cause variability. Especially, film thickness and surface roughness are effective on fracture toughness and electrical resistance of FRM. Nanofibers with high elastic modulus cause higher fracture toughness in cementitious composites. The high contact angle of the fibers causes loss of compressive strength as it prevents hydration of the cement paste and water. 5) It is concluded that even though the electrical resistance of the concrete increases when graphene oxide is mixed into the cementitious composite directly, the mortar's electrical resistance decreases when graphene oxide was added to the mortar in PVA/GO composite form due to the formation of hydrogen bond which may formed between the hydroxyl groups in the PVA structure and the functional groups in the graphene oxide structure."
