0,Introduction,"The surfactant molecule consists of hydrophilic head groups and hydrophobic tail chains which can be arranged on the surface of solution. The surface tension of solution can be significantly reduced although a relatively small amount of surfactant is added. In recent years, surfactants have been used in many fields [1–5] and they are the main components in laundry, cosmetics and household cleaning products, accounting for 15%–40% in total detergent formulation [6]. In general, water is difficult to wet a hydrophobic solid surface due to higher surface tension. However, wetting ability on low energy solid surface is crucial in washing industry [7,8]. Therefore, surfactants, which can improve the wettability of aqueous solution on the hydrophobic solid surface, are essential. And surface tension and contact angle can reflect the wettability [9]. There are a large number of meaningful studies related to wettability. Huang et al. [10] solved the problems about membrane fouling in oilfield based on the principle of wettability. Nascimento et al. [11] researched the factors affecting the wettability of nonionic surfactants, such as surface roughness and different ethoxylation degrees. Yilbas et al. [12] achieved the reversible exchange between the state of hydrophobic and hydrophilicity by depositing functionalized silica nano-particles on the surface of the crystallized polycarbonate. Zhi and his colleagues [13] prepared the superhydrophobic epoxy resin by modifying the silica, and the sample showed great durability, water-repellency and superior adhesion to the substrate. It is quite interesting to study wetting behavior of surfactants. In addition, anionic and nonionic surfactants are widely used in washing industry due to their excellent detergency, water solubility, heat resistance, salt tolerance, low preparation cost and environmental friendliness [14–16]. However, it is difficult for common surfactants to have both anionic and nonionic properties. It is worth mentioning that fatty alcohol ether carboxylic ester is a new type of surfactant (Scheme 1 ) with the characteristics of both anionic and nonionic surfactants. They have a great deal of enjoyable properties. (ⅰ) The ethylene oxide (EO) chain and the COO− group are in the middle and at the end of the molecule respectively, which gives molecule better calcium soap dispersing ability and resistance to hard water and electrolytes [17–19]. (ⅱ) Two hydrophilic groups (EO chain and anionic head group) and one hydrophobic group (carbon chain) give it excellent surface activity, emulsifying properties and foaming properties [20–22]. (ⅲ) The ester group in the fatty alcohol ether carboxylic ester molecule makes surfactant safer and more environmentally friendly because it can form a salt and a nonionic surfactant having outstanding biodegradability by hydrolysis [23,24]. (ⅳ) Linear surfactants have better self-degrading ability than branched ones [25]. However, there have been few reports on the linear fatty alcohol ether carboxylic ester surfactants. In this paper, linear fatty alcohol ether carboxylic ester surfactants (A12/14EC9E-H and A12/14EC9E-Na) were synthesized successfully. Furthermore, a comparative study on the surface activity and adsorption behavior at the air/water interface of fatty alcohol ether carboxylic ester and fatty alcohol ether was carried out. This research will not only be beneficial to the development of novel surfactants, but also broaden the applications such as wetting agents."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemicals and materials,"2.1 Chemicals and materials Linear fatty alcohol ether (A12/14EO9, hydroxyl value = 94.13, average molecular weight = 596) with purity higher than 99% was obtained from Sinolight Surfactants Technology Co., Ltd. Succinic anhydride (molecular weight = 100.07) with purity higher than 99% was purchased from Tianjin Kemiou Chemical Co., Ltd., China. Both A12/14EO9 and succinic anhydride are considered as raw materials of the reaction. Triply water used in the experiment came from pure water machine (UPD-II-20 T, Shanghai China)."
3,Experimental techniques,"2.2 Experimental techniques Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Bruker Vertex 70, Germany) was used to study the functional groups of novel surfactants at room temperature. A small amount of liquid product was coated on the KBr sheet, and the wavenumber of the FT-IR ranged from 4000 to 500 cm−1. A 1H-Nuclear magnetic resonance (1HNMR) spectrum was obtained with a Varian INOVA-400 MHz spectrometer (USA), using deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) as solvent. The MALDI-TOF-MS experiment was performed on a Bruker Ultraflextreme MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Inc., Billarica, MA) with an Nd : YAG laser intensity of 30% and the software package of Bruker Data Analysis 3.3 was used to analyze data. Surface tension of samples was measured at 25 ± 0.2 °C by using a Krüss K12 Processor Tension meter (Wilhelmy plate method). In order to ensure the stability and uniformity of surfactant solutions, samples need to be prepared in advance and placed for at least 12 h. Before experiment, surface tension of triply distilled water (γ = 72.00 ± 0.50 mN/m) was measured to calibrate the surface tension meter. To minimize the error, each sample was tested three times. The conductivity was obtained by using a conductivity analyzer (model DDS-307, Shanghai INESA & Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd) at 25 ± 0.2 °C. Each sample was placed for 3 min prior to the measurement and three iterations of the operation were carried out in order to guarantee the accuracy of the results. Drop Shape Analyzer DSA255 (Krüss Company, Germany) was used to investigate the wetting ability of samples on the paraffin film at 25 ± 0.2 °C. Placing a parafilm with the droplet to be tested in front of the microscope, and the dynamic spreading process of droplet was recorded by the connected CCD camera. Eventually, contact angles at different times were calculated by software. Each sample was measured three times repeatedly to ensure that the deviation was within a reasonable limit as small as possible. The dynamic surface tension of samples was tested by BP-100 Krüss using bubble pressure method at 25 ± 0.2 °C, and the effective surface ages are 0.01–250 s. Samples to be tested were prepared in advance and balanced for at least 12 h."
4,Synthesis,"2.3 Synthesis Acid fatty alcohol ether carboxylic ester surfactant A12/14EC9E-H was synthesized by a green one-step method. It is worth noting that not only irritating substances such as chloroacetic acid and chloroacetate [26] are not involved, but also expensive metals like Pt and Pd [27] are not used. Specifically, A12/14EO9 (59.60 g, 0.100 mol) and succinic anhydride (10.51 g, 0.105 mol) were added to the four-necked flask and reacted at 90 °C for 1 h. As a consequence, the acid product A12/14EC9E-H was obtained. The yield was 97% by determining the acid value before and after the reaction. In addition, a part of A12/14EC9E-H was neutralized with NaOH solution and salt product A12/14EC9E-Na was prepared. The synthetic routes were showed in scheme 2 :"
5,Structure characterization,"2.4 Structure characterization FT-IR, 1HNMR and MALDI-TOF-MS were used to characterize the chemical structure of novel surfactants. The FT-IR spectra of raw material (A12/14EO9) and acid product (A12/14EC9E-H) are shown in Fig. 1 (a), and both of them had similar contours, including -C-H symmetrical and asymmetric stretching vibration peaks at 2800-1300 cm−1, CO characteristic absorption peaks at 1300-1000 cm−1 and OH wide stretching vibration peak near 3400 cm−1. However, at 1737 cm−1, sample A12/14EC9E-H has a characteristic absorption vibration peak of CO, but A12/14EO9 does not. Furthermore, for A12/14EC9E-H, not only the position of stretching vibration absorption peak had a blue shift but also became wider. The possible reason of the phenomenon is the existence of electron withdrawing group in A12/14EC9E-H and the hydrogen bond association of −OH is more likely to occur in −COOH. It is apparent that the ester group is present in the product, indicating that A12/14EC9E-H was successfully synthesized. 1HNMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): 0.872 (3H, a), 1.248 (20H, b), 1.553 (2H, c), 2.640 (4H, f), 3.436 (2H, d), 3.638 (36H, e). The solvent peak appears at 7.289 ppm, and hydrogen in the carboxyl group (g) does not show a peak in the solvent [8]. The spectrum of A12/14EC9E-H is shown in Fig. 1(b). The MALDI-TOF-MS spectrum from A12/14EC9E-H is shown in Fig. 1(c), and the peak of m/z exhibits a normal distribution, which is owing to the fact that material is a polymer (C12/14 and EOn). Specifically, after the sample is combined with the matrix α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (HCCA), the detectable signals are generated, and the molecular weight of each substance can be clearly seen in Fig. 1(c). Furthermore, the m/z values of A12EOn (C12) able to be summarized as 457 + 44n (n is the numbers of EO, which is a positive integer). Similarly, the m/z values of A14EOn (C14) can be replaced by the formula 485 + 44n. For example, the values of m/z are 853 and 881 are the signals of A12EC9E-H and A14EC9E-H, respectively. Two kinds of carbon atoms (C12 and C14) alternates, and EO number performances a normal distribution centered at 9 ( x - EO = 9 ). Finally, the results of MALDI-TOF-MS proved that the high purity A12/14EC9E-H was successfully synthesized."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Static surface tension,"3.1 Static surface tension Reducing the surface tension of aqueous solutions is one of the basic characteristics of surfactants, and static surface tension can directly reveal the ability of surfactants to reduce the surface tension. Furthermore, the surface activities of surfactants are evaluated by critical micelle concentration (cmc) and surface tension at critical micelle concentration (γcmc ). Hence, Fig. 2 shows the relationships between the concentration (7.0 × 10−5 mmol/L < C <0.7 mmol/L) and corresponding surface tension (γ). As the concentration increases, the values of γ decrease in a straight line and then reach to equilibrium. The γcmc of A12/14EC9E-H and A12/14EC9E-Na are 30.20 and 33.01 mN/m, respectively, which has no significant difference with the structurally similar raw material A12/14EO9 (γcmc = 30.33 mN/m). Nevertheless, the cmc of A12/14EC9E-H and A12/14EC9E-Na are 0.044 and 0.070 mmol/L, respectively, which are lower than the cmc of A12/14EO9 (cmc =0.089 mmol/L). Besides, some surface activity parameters of samples at the air/water interface were calculated for further exploration, including maximum surface excess concentration (Γmax ), minimum surface area (Amin ), negative logarithm of C20 (pC20 ) and ability to adsorb and form micelles (cmc/C20 ). They can be obtained by Gibbs adsorption formulas [28]. (1) Γ m a x = − 1 2.303 nRT ( ∂ γ ∂ lg ⁡ C ) T (2) A min = 1 N A Γ m a x (3) pC 20 = - lg ⁡ C 20 Where C is the concentration of surfactant, (∂γ/∂lgC) T is the slope of surface tension (γ) versus logarithm of concentration (lgC) when C < cmc, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/molK), T is the absolute temperature (298.15 K) and NA is the Avogadro's constant (6.02 × 1023). n is considered as the number of solute species, since A12/14EO9 and A12/14EC9E-H are both nonionic surfactants, n is 1. Whereas anionic surfactant A12/14EC9E-Na can ionize without other electrolytes, n is 2. C20 indicates the molar concentration of surfactant solution when the surface tension of water is reduced by 20 mN/m. Therefore, pC20 can be used to evaluate the efficiency of surfactants in reducing the surface tension of aqueous solutions. The surface activity parameters of three surfactants are shown in Table 1 . It can be clearly seen from the table that the trends of Гmax and Amin are opposite. Surfactant molecules with larger Гmax and smaller Amin can be closely arranged at the air/water interface. The Гmax of nonionic surfactants (2.41 and 2.68 μmol/m2) are larger than that of the ionic surfactant (2.02 μmol/m2) with the same EO numbers, which is probably due to the charge repulsions between the polar head groups of ionic surfactants. Interestingly, the Гmax and Amin of A12/14EC9E-H are greater and smaller than that of A12/14EO9, respectively, mainly because −OH has a stronger ability to form hydrogen bonds in the carboxyl group than in the alcohol. In addition, the repulsive force between the polar head groups of A12/14EC9E-H is less than that of A12/14EC9E-Na. As a consequence, A12/14EC9E-H has a stronger ability to reduce the surface tension of aqueous solutions, which is manifested by smaller cmc, γcmc as well as larger pC20 . The value of cmc/C20 reflects the adsorption capacity of surfactants at the air/water interface and the ability to form micelles in the bulk phase. From Table 1, cmc/C20 of A12/14EC9E-Na is lower than that of A12/14EO9 and A12/14EC9E-H. Specifically, the molecules adsorption diagram of A12/14EC9E-H and A12/14EC9E-Na at the air/water interface are vividly shown in Scheme 3 ."
8,Conductivity,"3.2 Conductivity For ionic surfactants, conductivity is another method of measuring cmc. When micelles are formed by ionic surfactants, a part of ions with opposite charges will be attracted to the surface of micelles because of coulomb attraction and combined into a part of micelles. Moreover, the average number of counter ions are bounded to each surfactant ion is called the counter ion binding degree, which is generally expressed by β. As shown in Fig. 3 , the conductivity increases with increasing concentration. However, the increase rate of conductivity becomes slower when micelles are formed, because the moving rate of micelles is slower than that of the ions in aqueous solution. The ionization degree α and counter ion binding degree β (β = 1 - α) can be calculated by comparing the slope of conductivity curve near cmc [29,30]. The cmc of A12/14EC9E-Na is determined by conductivity method to be 0.07 mmol/L, which is consistent with the results of static surface tension. The values of α and β are calculated via Eqs. (4,5) are 0.8961 and 0.1039, respectively. Gibbs free energy of micellization ( ΔG mic ) is 20.48 KJ/mol which can be obtained from Eq. (6). ΔG mic < 0 , so the formation of micelles is spontaneous. (4) α = ( d κ d c ) C > c m c / ( d κ d c ) C < c m c (5) β = 1 − α (6) ΔG m i c = ( 1 + 3 β ) RTln ( cmc / 55.5 ) + 3 RTβln 3 Where R is the gas constant (8.314 J/molK), T is the absolute temperature (298.15 K). In addition, the standard Gibbs free energy of adsorption ( ΔG ad 0 ) also can be obtained from Eqs. (7,8) [31]. (7) π cmc = γ 0 − γ cmc (8) Δ G a d 0 = Δ G m i c 0 − ( π c m c Γ c m c ) Where γ0 is the surface tension of pure solvent (water), πcmc is the surface pressure at cmc. By calculation, the πcmc and ΔG ad 0 values of A12/14EC9E-Na are 39.58 mN/m and -22.44 KJ/mol, respectively. Not only ΔG ad 0 and ΔG mic 0 are negative, but | ΔG ad 0 | > | ΔG mic 0 | , which proves that the adsorption process at the air/water interface is easier than in the bulk phase [32]."
9,Wetting ability,"3.3 Wetting ability The wetting ability of hydrophobic solid surfaces plays a vital role in human's production and life. Surfactants are widely used to facilitate the surface wetting, including pharmaceutical, cosmetics, home care products, agrichemicals and coatings [33–35]. Therefore, it is significant to study the wetting ability of synthesized surfactant on the hydrophobic solid surfaces. The contact angles of A12/14EO9, A12/14EC9E-H and A12/14EC9E-Na solutions on the parafilm are balanced in a short time (Fig. 4 a–c), indicating that the surfactant molecules move fast. As shown in Fig.4d, A12/14EC9E-H has the smallest contact angle at 120 s, so it has the best wettability on the parafilm. Furthermore, in order to better visualize the wettability of surfactants on the hydrophobic film, taking A12/14EC9E-Na as an example, Fig. 5 displays the shape of the surfactant droplets on the parafilm at 120 s. Clearly, when C < cmc (0.02 and 0.05 mmol/L), the spread of droplets is significantly increased as the concentration of surfactant increases. However, when C > cmc (0.2 and 2 mmol/L), the shape of droplet does not change obviously with increasing concentration. The phenomenon can be explained by the Young's equation [21]: (9) γ s g = γ l g c o s θ + γ s l Where θ is the contact angle, γsl , γlg and γsg are the interfacial tension of solid/water, water/air and solid/air, respectively. As the concentration increases, the values of γlg and γsl gradually decrease, and γ sg is considered to be a constant because the paraffin film is used as a solid substrate. Therefore, in order to maintain the Young's equation equilibrium, θ must be reduced, which could explain the reason why the trend of the contact angle with surfactant concentration is similar to the surface tension."
10,Dynamic surface tension,"3.4 Dynamic surface tension By showing changes in surface tension over time, dynamic surface tension can reflect the diffusion and adsorption rate of surfactant molecules at the air/water interface. When surfactant molecules migrate from bulk phase to the surface, the dynamic adsorption properties would affect the performances of surfactant [36]. It is not only crucial for studying the wetting ability, but also essential for exploring the adsorption kinetics. The dynamic surface tension was measured via the maximum bubble pressure method. Specifically, a new air/water interface will be generated inside the solution when the bubble is blown out from the capillary, which would take some time for surfactant molecules in the solution to reach the new interface. The shorter the migration time, the faster the surface tension decreases at the same bubble life and the faster is substrate is wetted. Fig. 6 shows the surface tension versus surface age for samples with various concentrations at 25 ± 0.2 °C. Even though the concentration of surfactant solution is pretty small, each curve in the figure is still smooth, which means that the surfactant molecular membrane at the air/water interface is relatively stable. Obviously, the surface tension of surfactant solutions decreases rapidly at the beginning and then remains stable. When C < cmc, the surface tension cannot get to the minimum whereas C > cmc it can. Hence, the reducing surface tension ability of surfactants is affected by the concentration, and the greater the concentration, the stronger the ability to reduce surface tension. Moreover, when C > cmc, the equilibrium surface tensions of A12/14EO9, A12/14EC9E-H and A12/14EC9E-Na are 31.01, 30.86 and 33.20 mN/m, respectively, which is consistent with the results of static surface tension. Based on the Rosen's theory [37], with the change of adsorption time, dynamic surface tension can be divided into four regions, including induction, rapid decline, meso-equilibrium and equilibrium region. The first three regions follow the Rosen formula: (10) γ 0 - γ t γ t - γ m = ( t t * ) n Where γ0 , γt and γm are the surface tensions of pure solvent, surfactant solution at the time of t and at the moment of meso-equilibrium, respectively. t* is the time while the surface tension is the mean of γ0 and γm . Both t* and n are constants, while t* has a time unit and n is dimensionless. Taking the logarithm on both sides of Eq. (10), Eq. (11) is obtained as follows: (11) lg ⁡ [ ( γ 0 - γ t ) / ( γ t - γ m ) ] = nlg ⁡ t - nlg ⁡ t * According to Eq. (11), the figures of lgk ( k = ( γ 0 - γ t ) / ( γ t - γ m ) ) versus lgt for various samples are displayed in Fig. 7 . The characteristic parameters of dynamic surface tension such as n and t* can be obtained from the slope and intercept of the fitting straight line. When k = 0.1, the induction region ends, and when k = 10, the rapid decline region ends (the meso-equilibrium region begins), so Eqs. (12,13) can be derived. (12) lg ⁡ t m = lg ⁡ t * + 1 /n (13) lg ⁡ t i = lg ⁡ t * - 1 /n Where ti and tm are the time at which the induction region ends and the meso-equilibrium region begins, respectively. The decreases rate of surface tension in the rapid decline region at the time of t* (R1/2 ) is defined by Eq. (14), and the larger the value, the higher the surface activity of the surfactant. (14) R 1 / 2 =( γ 0 - γ m ) / 2 t * Dynamic surface tension is controlled by the adsorption energy and diffusion energy, and Table 2 lists the characteristics parameters, including n, t*, ti, tm , and R1/2 . nlgt represents the surface tension that in the regions of rapid decline and meso-equilibrium, reflecting the diffusion energy of molecules from bulk phase to the interface. n is the fundamental tendency of surfactant molecules to absorb at the air/water interface, and the larger the value, the faster the surfactant molecules diffuse. A12/14EC9E-H has the largest n, indicating the fastest diffusion rate. In addition, for the same sample, the values of n decrease with concentration, which is probably due to the repulsion forces between intermolecular or the formation of micelles hinder their movement. t* is relevant to the adsorption energy and increases with increasing concentration. A12/14EC9E-Na has the lowest adsorption energy because it has the smallest t*. tm is the starting time of meso-equilibrium region and decreases with the increases of concentration. A12/14EC9E-H has the smallest tm , so the rate to reach equilibrium is the fastest, which is consistent with the result of its maximum n. ti is the ending time of induction region, which is connected with the diffusion coefficient of molecules in a short period and the surface coverage. Similarly, the ti value of A12/14EC9E-H is larger, indicating that it has a higher efficiency to reduce the surface tension of solution."
11,Diffusion coefficient,"3.5 Diffusion coefficient The dynamic adsorption process model for surfactants was proposed by Eastoe [38]. He believed that when the concentration of surfactant solution is lower than cmc, the adsorption of surfactant molecules on the fresh surface is divided into two steps. (ⅰ) Surfactant molecules transferred between the surface and subsurface layer, where the thickness of the two is only a few molecules. (ⅱ) Surfactant molecules diffused from bulk phase to the underlying layer. Subsequently, the equation was simplified and quantified by the asymptote equation that was proposed by the Fainerman, which are shown in Eqs. (15,16) [39,40]. (15) γ ( t ) t→0 = γ 0 − 2 nRTC 0 D t π (16) γ ( t ) t→∞ = γ e q + nRTΓ eq 2 C 0 π 4 Dt Where γ(t) and γeq are the surface tensions of surfactant solution at the time of t and equilibrium, respectively. γ0 is the surface tension of solvent water, Γeq is the surface excess concentration at equilibrium and C0 is the concentration of surfactant in the bulk phase. In addition, n is 1 and 2 for nonionic and ionic surfactant, respectively. In the initial adsorption stage, surfactant molecules are readily adsorbed onto the air/water interface. However, in the later stage, only molecules with the same orientation and capability of overcoming the intermolecular repulsive forces can reach the air/water interface. At this point, the adsorption mechanism has been transformed from the diffusion adsorption control to the barrier adsorption control. According to Eqs. (13,14), the dynamic surface tension as functions of t1/2 and t−1/2, including A12/14EO9, A12/14EC9E-H and A12/14EC9E-Na solutions with diverse concentrations are presented in Fig. 8 . When t→0, γ(t) and t1/2 are linear, and the intercept of the line is γ0 . Similarly, when t→∞, γ(t) and t-1/2 are linear, the intercept of the line is γeq . The diffusion coefficients of each sample, such as Dlong (t→∞) and Dshort (t→0), can be calculated from the slope of the line, and the results are listed in Table 3 . As can be seen from Table 3, for the same sample (any one of A12/14EO9, A12/14EC9E-H and A12/14EC9E-Na), as the concentration increases, the time to reach equilibrium is shortened and the decrease rate of surface tension is also increased, which is mainly because a growing number of surfactant molecules diffuse and adsorb to the air/water interface. Interestingly, for the same sample, Dshort is always greater than Dlong , which proves that the diffusion rate of molecules is faster in a short time. This is probably due to the fact that more adsorption sites in the air/water interface during the initial diffusion phase. However, as the concentration of surfactant increases, the repulsive force between the molecules increases, and surfactant molecules diffuse not only from the bulk phase to the surface layer, but also from the surface layer to the bulk phase. Furthermore, we also found that as the concentration increases, the Dshort values of three surfactants increase first (C < cmc) and then decrease (C > cmc). One possible reason is that when the concentration is smaller, the repulsion between intermolecular has less effect on them, whereas the repulsive force become larger with the increases of concentration within a limited air/water interface. At the same time, Dlong decrease with increasing concentration, which may be the result of the intermolecular repulsive force plays a leading role. When C > cmc, Dlong /Dshort < 1, which make clearly the fact that the mechanism of adsorption process is mixed diffusion-kinetic adsorption [41]. For the same concentration of various samples, A12/14EC9E-Na has the smallest Dshort and the largest Dlong , demonstrating that it diffuses the slowest in a short time and the fastest in a long period, respectively. The reason for the change in D is that the repulsive force between the polar head group makes it diffuse slower at the beginning. However, as the concentration increases, the cmc of A12/14EC9E-Na is larger than that of A12/14EO9 and A12/14EC9E-H. In other words, it is difficult to form the slowly moving micelle, so it moves faster in the later stage."
12,Conclusions,"In this study, the novel linear fatty alcohol ether carboxylic ester (A12/14EC9E-H and A12/14EC9E-Na) surfactants have been successfully prepared with a green and efficient one-step method. The results of FT-IR, 1HNMR and MALDI-TOF-MS indicate that the synthesized product is the target product. For nonionic surfactants, the product (A12/14EC9E-H) shows better surface activities compared with the raw material (A12/14EO9), such as larger Гmax, pC20, cmc/C20 and smaller Amin. Furthermore, the acid product A12/14EC9E-H can significantly reduce the surface tension of water to 30.20 mN/m, and the cmc is 0.044 mmol/L. The outcomes of conductivity measurement show that the cmc of A12/14EC9E-Na is consistent with that of the static surface tension and the formation of micelles is spontaneous. In addition, the consequence of the contact angle reveals that A12/14EC9E-H has better wettability on the hydrophobic solid surface and faster diffusion rate to the air/water interface than A12/14EO9, which also can be seen from the outcome of dynamic surface tension. Moreover, the result of dynamic surface tension makes clearly the mechanism of adsorption process is the mixed diffusion-kinetic adsorption for A12/14EO9, A12/14EC9E-H and A12/14EC9E-Na."
