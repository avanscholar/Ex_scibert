0,Introduction,"Environmental issues and depleting fuel and chemical sources have propelled the use of alternative sources to meet the ever-increasing worldwide demand [1-5]. Biomass is considered as a promising source of energy and chemicals because of its high energy potential and sustainability. In addition, the utilization of biomass contributes to the reduction in environmental problems caused by petrochemical processes [6, 7]. Based on this, the conversion of biomass into valuable chemicals has been extensively explored; for example, the pyrolysis of biomass produces liquid biofuel that can be used as a substitute for transportation fuel, while anaerobic digestion of biomass produces fatty acids that are useful for the production of value-added chemicals [8-10]. Generally, the conversion of waste biomass in anaerobic digesters produces short-chain fatty acids that are difficult to separate owing to their miscibility with the fermentation broth [11-13]. Therefore, a method favoring the production of medium-chain fatty acids by utilizing chain elongation technology inside the digester to simplify the separation procedure has been established [14, 15]. Additionally, medium-chain fatty acids have higher energy densities than short-chain fatty acids because of their higher carbon-to-oxygen ratio, indicating their potential for use as alternative fuels or chemical intermediates. The energy of 1 mol of caproate (3452 kJ) is higher than that of 2 moles of ethanol (2638 kJ) [16]. This highlights the importance of medium-chain fatty acids in the production of chemicals and fuels. Octanoic acid is a medium-chain fatty acid that can be produced through the abovementioned technology or by direct pyrolysis of waste plastic and wood dust [10, 17, 18]. It is also present in vegetable oils [19]. Currently, octanoic acid is widely used as a food preservative agent because of its antibacterial and antifungal properties [20-22]. However, regarding the increasing demand for alternative sources of fuels and chemicals, upgrading of octanoic acid through hydrogenation is crucial because it can be converted into more valuable chemicals, such as octanol. Octanol is more versatile as it can be used not only in the production of fragrances, medicines, detergents, lubricants, and emulsifiers, but also as an alternative to conventional transportation fuel [9, 23-25]. Hydrogenation of octanoic acid is complicated by the low electrophilicity of the carbonyl group and the difficulty in controlling the selectivity to octanol. Therefore, catalysts with high hydrogenation activities, of which the activities and selectivities can be controlled, are required [23, 26, 27]. Noble metal-based catalysts are known for their high hydrogenation activities in carboxylic acid hydrogenation [28-32]. However, all reported studies on the hydrogenation of octanoic acid are based on non-noble metal catalysts, such as In2O3/CuP [33], NiMo/ZrO2 [10], Ni/Al2O3 [34], and Ni/ZrO2 [17]. The hydrogenation of octanoic acid over In2O3/CuP resulted in 86 % conversion, but only 55% of octanol selectivity was achieved under harsh reaction conditions [33]. The addition of a second metal to Ni resulted in an improvement in the activity of NiMo/ZrO2 in the hydrogenation of octanoic acid. Although conversion up to 93 % was achieved at 350°C, cracking and esterification limited the selectivity to octanol [10]. Furthermore, the addition of In2O3 to Ni/ZrO2 for the hydrogenation of octanoic acid increased the selectivity to octanol; however, this result was still unsatisfactory, as a conversion of only 80 % and selectivity to octanol of 70 % were achieved [34]. These studies indicate that non-noble metal catalysts have a limitation in the selective production of alcohol from carboxylic acid. The use of noble metal catalysts for the hydrogenation of various carboxylic acids has been widely reported; specifically the use of Ru, owing to its higher hydrogenation activity compared to other noble metals [26, 35]. Ru-based catalysts have been investigated for the hydrogenation of propionic acid [28, 36], oleic acid [37], and lactic acid [38]. For example, Ru catalysts with different supports (TiO2, ZrO2, SiO2, Al2O3, SiO2-Al2O3) have been examined for aqueous phase hydrogenation of propanoic acid [28]. It is reported that in the hydrogenation of propanoic acid, the formation of acyl was the key intermediate and the C=O hydrogenation activity depended on the formation of metal-acid sites on the catalyst. It is also stated that decarbonylation of acyl was preferred on support with lower acidity whereas hydrogenation was more likely to occur on support with higher acidity such as Al2O3. Therefore, the hydrogenation over Ru/Al2O3 started from the adsorption of C=O to form acyl and followed by H transfer to the acyl to form alcohol. While the high hydrogenation activity of Ru ensures high conversions of acids, it has a limitation that must be overcome. Ru is active for C-C bond hydrogenolysis, which can lead to over-hydrogenation of the desired products and a reduction in the selectivity towards the alcohol [28, 39]. Thus, the addition of a second metal to Ru-based catalysts, to control the metal activity, has been extensively studied [40]. Sn is usually added to Ru to selectively convert carboxylic acids to alcohols, because of its ability to selectively cleave C-O bonds [41]. Bimetallic RuSn has been used in the hydrogenation of various compounds, such as rosin [42], dicarboxylic acids [43], crotonaldehyde [44], cinnamaldehyde [45], levulinic acid [46], and succinic acid [47], resulting in high conversions and selectivities towards the respective alcohols. Bimetallic RuSn has also been used in the hydrogenation of ester. Deshpande et al. [48, 49] conducted the hydrogenation of methyl hexadecanoate, methyl-9-octadecenoate and dimethyl succinate over Ru-Sn-B catalyst. They found that the addition of Sn tuned the activity of Ru-B to selectively hydrogenate aldehyde and ester to alcohol. It is reported that the presence of Ru0 and SnOx were important for the high hydrogenation activity, in which that Ru provided hydride transfer and SnOx acted as the adsorption sites for C=O due to its Lewis acidity. They observed the formation of RuSn alloy, but they did not consider the activity of RuSn alloy because of the small amount as compared to the SnOx and Ru0. Pouilloux et al. [50] also observed that Ru0 and SnOx were the major phase and found no formation of RuSn alloy on Ru-Sn-B catalyst for the hydrogenation of methyl oleate. They also found that during the hydrogenation of methyl oleate, transesterification of methyl oleate with oleyl alcohol also occurred depending on the Sn/Ru ratio, with higher Sn/Ru ratio resulting in a heavier ester compound. Recently, Luo et al. reported almost complete conversion of coconut oil and a selectivity towards the alcohol of 96.6 % using RuSn/SiO2 as the catalyst at 240°C and 40 atm H2 [51]. According to this report, the high hydrogenation activity and selectivity to alcohol achieved by the RuSn bimetallic catalyst were due to the formation of a Ru3Sn7 alloy on the surface of the catalyst. This finding is contradictive to the previous report by Pouilloux et al. [50] that states Ru0 and SnOx were the main active sites for hydrogenation. In the report, Luo et al. proposed that Ru3Sn7 was the main active site while the presence of SnOx catalyzed the esterification of the alcohol. They stated that in Ru3Sn7 alloy phase electrons were transferred from Sn to Ru, which increased the electron density on Ru, resulting in a suppression of reduction ability towards C=C bond. The C=O bond of acid attached to the Sn site and H-transfer from Ru occurred to form alcohol [51]. Thus, based on this report, the presence of RuSn alloy is the key for the high activity of carboxylic acid hydrogenation. In our previous study, the vapor phase hydrogenation of butyric acid was studied over RuSn/ZnO [52]. Almost complete conversion of butyric acid and more than 98 % selectivity to butanol were observed when performing the reaction at 265°C, 25 atm, and a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 0.9 h−1. The reported catalyst activity was maintained over 3500 h without any significant deactivation. In this study, the vapor phase hydrogenation of octanoic acid was conducted in a fixed-bed continuous-flow reactor over a bimetallic RuSn/ZnO catalyst. To the best of our knowledge, the hydrogenation of octanoic acid over noble metal-based bimetallic catalysts has not yet been reported. The effects of the operating conditions (temperature, total pressure, H2 partial pressure, and H2 flow rate) and the addition of Sn to Ru/ZnO were investigated in the hydrogenation of octanoic acid. The catalyst stability was also tested over 1000 h."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The chemicals used for the preparation of Ru/ZnO and RuSn/ZnO, such as RuCl3.xH2O (99.9 %), SnCl4.5H2O (98.0 %), and Zn(NO3)2.6H2O (98 %), were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Co. Ltd. (USA). NaOH (98 %) was purchased from Samchun Chemicals (Korea) and used to control the pH of the solution during the catalyst synthesis. Octanoic acid, (>98 %) used as the feed, and n-hexane (>97 %), used as the solvent for GC analysis, were obtained from Sigma Aldrich Co. Ltd. (USA). The standards used for GC quantification, such as octanal (99 %) and octanol (99 %), were obtained from Sigma Aldrich Co. Ltd. and Acros Organics (USA), respectively."
3,Synthesis of Ru/ZnO and RuSn/ZnO,"2.2 Synthesis of Ru/ZnO and RuSn/ZnO Ru/ZnO and RuSn/ZnO were prepared using a sequential coprecipitation-deposition method as described in the previous study [52]. The Ru content for both Ru/ZnO and RuSn/ZnO was set at 1.4 wt%. The Sn content in RuSn/ZnO was set at a Ru/Sn molar ratio of 1/2. The coprecipitation method starts from the preparation of aqueous solution containing 0.1 M Zn(NO3)2.6H2O and 1.0 M SnCl4.5H2O. This solution was then added dropwise to 200 mL of water while adjusting the pH between 7.2 and 7.5 with continuous addition of NaOH. The solution was then continuously stirred for 12 h at room temperature. Ru was then deposited by adding dropwise an aqueous solution of 0.5 M RuCl3.xH2O while adjusting the pH to 7.2 and stirring the solution continuously for 5 h at room temperature. The solution was then heated at 85°C for 5 h without stirring. After heating, the solution was filtered and washed with deionized (DI) water to remove the Na+, NO3 −, and Cl− ions. The precipitate was dried overnight in an oven at 120°C. For Ru/ZnO, the catalyst was calcined in air at 500°C for 4 h to remove the remaining precursor ions, whereas the RuSn/ZnO catalyst was reduced directly without calcination. The purpose of using direct reduction without calcination method was to form pure alloy formation, as reported in our previous literature [52]. The catalysts were then pressed into a disc shape at 400 atm, crushed, and sieved to a specific size (425–1180 μm). The Ru/ZnO catalyst was reduced at 420°C for 4 h at a heating rate of 10°C/min, while the RuSn/ZnO catalyst was reduced using a direct reduction without calcination (DRC) method. The DRC method was as follows: the catalyst was heated from 20°C to 130°C over a ramping time of 1 h, followed by heating to 250°C over a ramping time of 2 h. Next, the temperature was slowly increased to 350°C over a ramping time of 3 h and held at this temperature for 2 h. The temperature was further increased to 420°C over a ramping time of 2 h. Up to this point, the reduction was conducted under 5 % H2/N2 gas. After reaching 420°C, the temperature was maintained for 6 h under a pure N2 atmosphere to increase the interaction of Ru and Sn to form stable alloy phase as reported in the previous literature [52]."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The crystal structures of the catalysts were determined using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Ultima IV, Japan) equipped with a Cu Kα radiation beam (λ = 0.15418 nm) operated at 45 kV and 200 mA. Scanning was conducted from 10 to 80° at a scanning speed of 2°/min. The interlayer spacing (d-spacing) was determined using Bragg's law (d = nλ/2sinθ), and the crystallite size was calculated using the Scherrer equation: (1) D c = K λ β c o s θ where K is the Scherrer constant with a value of 0.9, λ is the X-ray wavelength (0.15418 nm), β (radians) is the full width at half maximum for the respective angle (FWHM), and θ (radians) is the Bragg angle. The surface area of the catalysts was obtained by BET method, using an ASAP 2420 (Micromeritics, USA). The measurements were performed using a pressure range of 0.01–1 P/P0. Prior to analysis, the samples were pretreated by degassing for 30 min at 90°C and heating at 300°C for 4 h. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was conducted to elucidate the morphology of the catalyst and visualize the distribution of the metals on the catalyst. The images were collected using a Talos F200X STEM instrument operated at 200 keV. The Ru and Sn contents in the catalysts were determined by ICP-AES (Thermo Scientific iCAP 6600, USA). High-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted by using Axis Supra (Kratos Analytical Ltd., UK) equipped with monochromatic Al Kα source (1486.7 eV). The pass energy used was 40 eV to detect Ru and Sn oxidation state in the sample. Prior to the analysis, the catalyst was reduced in the similar manner as mentioned before and was passivated in controlled airflow. The sample was then sealed in a glass vial before pelletized for measurement. CHNS analysis was performed to check the possibility of coke formation on the spent catalyst after the hydrogenation experiment. The CHNS analysis was performed by using Thermo Scientific FLASH EA-2000 Organic Elemental Analyzer (EA) with detection limit of 0.1 %."
5,Catalytic experiments,"2.4 Catalytic experiments The reactivity test was conducted in a continuous fixed-bed downward flow stainless steel (SUS 316) reactor with a length of 40 cm and diameter of 0.75 cm (Ilhae System Co. Ltd., South Korea). A mesh was installed inside the reactor to act as a catalyst filter. The reactor was equipped with a heating jacket with a heating capability of up to 500°C, which was controlled by a PID controller. The reactor system was equipped with an HPLC pump (Chrom Tech Series 2, USA) to control the liquid flow rate of octanoic acid that entered the reactor, as well as an MFC controller (Atovac, Korea) to control the H2 flow rate. The system was also equipped with a vaporizer and a line heater at the pre-heating zone to vaporize the octanoic acid prior to it entering the reactor. The vaporizer and line heater temperatures were set at 250°C to ensure that no condensation of octanoic acid occurred before it entered the reactor. The pressure in the reactor was controlled using a back-pressure regulator. The scheme of the apparatus is shown in Figure S1. In a typical hydrogenation reaction, the catalyst (0.5 g) was placed in the middle of the reactor on the top of a quartz wool support. The reactor was subsequently flushed with H2 for several minutes to remove any residual air inside the reactor, pressurized to 30 atm H2, and a leak check was conducted to ensure the safety of the system. The reactor was de-pressurized, and catalyst activation was conducted using the method described in Section 2.2. Upon completion of the reduction process, the reactor was pressurized to 30 atm H2, and the temperature was then decreased to between 250 and 300°C. After reaching the desired temperature, octanoic acid was introduced into the reactor at a WHSV of 2 h−1 while maintaining H2/feed molar ratio at 70.8. The WHSV was calculated using following equation: (2) WHSV ( h − 1 ) = m ˙ O A m ˙ c a t where m ˙ O A (g.h−1) is the mass flow rate of octanoic acid and m ˙ c a t (g) is the mass of catalyst. In the H2 flow rate study, the H2 flow rate was controlled between 40 and 100 mL min−1 while maintaining a constant WHSV of 1 h−1. In the H2 partial pressure study, the total gas flow rate was fixed at 100 mL min−1 by changing the H2 flow rate from 100 to 40 mL min−1 . N2 gas was used as the make-up gas to balance the total flow rate to 100 mL min−1. After the reaction, the flowing vapor was cooled at -5°C in a heat exchanger connected to a chiller. The vapor was then condensed, and separation occurred between the carrier gas and the liquid product. The liquid product was collected by slowly opening the valve on the collection vessel. Liquid samples were collected every hour until a steady result was achieved before moving to the next operating condition. In general, a steady state was achieved after 3 h and the samples were collected every hour for another 2 to 3 h. The carbon mass balance of the products was estimated to be over 95% in all cases. The time on stream graphs for the samples can be seen in Figure S2. The collected liquid samples were diluted in n-hexane to a 5 % v/v concentration before being subjected to GC analysis. The GC used in this study was equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) (Youngin Chromass 6500 GC System, South Korea) and an autosampler (Younglin YL3000A, South Korea). A RTX-5 column (Restek, USA) with dimension of 30 m x 0.32 mm x 0.25 μm was used for the analysis. An injection volume of 1 μL was used, with a split ratio of 1:50. The GC program was as follows: the temperature was held at 40°C for 5 min, increased to 250°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min, and held at 250°C for 4 min. The amounts of octanoic acid, octanal, and octanol in the sample were determined by using calibration curves, while the amount of octyl octanoate was determined using the effective carbon number method as shown in Equation 3. (3) C i = C r e f A r e f × A i × n e f f , r e f n e f f , i The subscripts i and ref refer to the desired chemical species and reference, respectively. Therefore, Ci, Cref, Ai, Aref, Neff,i, and Neff,ref refer to the concentration (C), GC peak area (A), and effective carbon number (Neff) of the desired chemical species and reference, respectively. In this case, octyl octanoate was calculated using octanol as the reference. The catalyst performance was evaluated considering the octanoic acid conversion and selectivity to the products, namely octanal, octanol, and octyl octanoate, which were calculated using the following equations: (4) Conversion ( % ) = ( 1 − mol of octanoic acid in product mol of injected octanoic acid ) × 100 (5) S i = S e l e c t i v i t y o f p r o d u c t i ( % ) = ( v i n i ∑ v i n i ) × 100 In the Equation (5), v i represents the carbon number of respective products i (8 for octanal, octanol, and octanoic acid) and n i represents the number of moles in the product."
6,Result and Discussion,
7,Catalyst Characterization,"3.1 Catalyst Characterization Table S1 shows the BET, CO pulse chemisorption and ICP-AES result. The surface area of RuSn/ZnO is 26.7 m2/g, which is approximately seven times higher than that of Ru/ZnO, possibly due to the difference in the pretreatment for both catalysts. Measurement of the metal content by ICP-AES reveals that the Ru and Sn content in the RuSn/ZnO catalyst are 1.0 and 2.8 wt%, while approximately 1.3 wt% Ru is present in Ru/ZnO, close to the desired metal content. The CO pulse chemisorption result shows that the amount of CO adsorbed on the catalyst for both RuSn/ZnO and Ru/ZnO is 1.5 and 2.2 μmol gcat −1. Since the adsorption of CO does not occur on Sn, the metal surface area and metal dispersion were recalculated based solely on the Ru metal [53, 54]. Recalculation of the CO uptake based on the Ru metal gives 143.4 and 169.4 μmol gRu −1 for RuSn/ZnO and Ru/ZnO, respectively. This corresponds to the active metal surface area of 5.3 and 6.3 m2 gRu −1. The calculation of Ru metal dispersion gives similar result at around 1.5% for both catalysts, despite higher total metal loading in RuSn/ZnO. Although the result of the CO chemisorption shows similar result, the significant difference in the surface area of both catalysts and the addition of Sn play important role in determining the ‘true’ metal dispersion. The RuSn/ZnO has a significantly higher surface area as compared to Ru/ZnO by seven times, meaning that the total CO uptake per area for RuSn/ZnO is exceptionally low as compared to Ru/ZnO. Moreover, Sn also actively blocks CO adsorption site on Ru and contributes to the reduction of the CO uptake. Therefore, the ‘true’ metal dispersion of RuSn/ZnO is underestimated and should have higher value than Ru/ZnO. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of RuSn/ZnO and Ru/ZnO which contain peaks at 31.8°, 34.4°, and 36.3° corresponding to the (100), (002), and (101) planes of ZnO (JCPDS card number 89-510), respectively. These peaks are the main peaks observed for both catalysts, however, the intensity of these peaks is different. The RuSn/ZnO has a lower peak intensity which suggests the formation of less crystalline ZnO as compared to Ru/ZnO. Calculation of crystallite size of ZnO (100) plane by Scherrer equation for both catalysts gives 18.4 and 42.5 nm for RuSn/ZnO and Ru/ZnO, respectively. This difference is caused by the pretreatment method, where Ru/ZnO goes through calcination and RuSn/ZnO does not. The change in the crystallinity in metal oxides as a function of temperature has been observed by Oh et al. [55]. It is stated that higher temperature contributes to the formation of highly crystalline material by sintering to minimize the surface energy. Similar result was observed on the ZnO nanoparticles [56]. Thus, the difference in the crystallinity of the support is attributed to this effect. The analysis of the XRD patterns in the 2θ region of 25 to 50° shows the active metal peaks (indicated by the yellow region and inset in Fig. 1). In the Ru/ZnO pattern, Ru0 peaks are observed at 38.3°, 42.3°, and 44°, corresponding to the (100), (002), and (101) planes, respectively (JCPDS card number 65-1863). These peaks are attributed to hexagonal Ru. The XRD pattern of the RuSn/ZnO catalyst shows a distinct peak at 41°, which corresponds to the Ru3Sn7 alloy (411) plane (JCPDS card number 26-0504). The formation of the Ru3Sn7 alloy phase over ZnO is assisted by the characteristics of ZnO, which provides moderate metal-support interactions, enabling the interaction between Ru and Sn [52]. Table 1 shows the calculated d-spacings and crystallite sizes of the catalysts. The Ru3Sn7 alloy in RuSn/ZnO has a calculated d-spacing of 0.22 nm and lattice parameter of 9.38 Å, which is in accordance with the Im-3m space group of an ordered Ru3Sn7 alloy (standard d-spacing and lattice parameter = 0.22 nm and 9.35 Å, respectively). The crystallite size of Ru3Sn7 (411) is 10.2 nm. In contrast, the Ru0 (101) plane shows a d-spacing of 0.21 nm with a crystallite size of 16.6 nm, as calculated by the Scherrer equation. The smaller crystallite size of Ru3Sn7 in RuSn/ZnO than the Ru0 in Ru/ZnO despite higher total metal loading is attributed to the difference in the pretreatment method. The RuSn/ZnO catalyst was not calcined, in contrast with the Ru/ZnO, so the dispersion of the Ru3Sn7 phase on the catalyst seems to be higher and the particles seem to be smaller. The negative influence of calcination on the metal dispersion of the catalyst has been reported previously [57]. Fig. 2 shows a structural image of reduced RuSn/ZnO, as observed by STEM. Two different lattice orientations are observed on the particles (yellow lines in Fig. 2) with d-spacings of 0.18 and 0.23 nm. The former corresponds to the ZnO (102) plane, whereas the latter corresponds to the (411) plane of Ru3Sn7, showing that the Ru3Sn7 alloy is formed on the surface of ZnO. Following this observation, high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and EDS mapping analyses were conducted, as shown in Fig. 3 . The EDS images indicate the uniform distribution of Ru and Sn on the ZnO support in a similar location, suggesting that Ru3Sn7 alloy formation is likely to occur on the support. The XPS measurement and the peak fitting result for both Ru/ZnO and RuSn/ZnO catalysts are reported in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4(a) shows the peak fitting of the Ru 3d5/2 spectra for both Ru/ZnO and RuSn/ZnO. The Ru/ZnO shows a distinct peak at 280.1 eV, which corresponds to the Ru0 species whereas the RuSn/ZnO shows a similar Ru0 peak at a lower binding energy of 279.5 eV. Meanwhile, the Sn species that present in RuSn/ZnO as observed in Sn 3d spectra can be distinguished into the Sn0 and Snδ+ peaks centered at 484.6 and 486.6 eV, respectively (Fig. 4b). This indicates that there are 3 different species on the surface of RuSn/ZnO: the Ru metal, the Sn metal, and the SnOx phase. Although the presence of both metals has been confirmed by XPS, one cannot simply conclude the formation of RuSn alloy as they can be separately isolated from each other. Thus, the difference in binding energy of the Ru0 becomes important because it can show if there is any interaction between Ru and Sn. From Fig. 4(a), the binding energy of Ru0 for RuSn/ZnO was lowered by 0.6 eV, suggesting that there is an interaction of Ru and Sn upon the addition of Sn. They are most likely interacting in the form of Ru3Sn7 alloy, which is in agreement with the XRD result. Therefore, on the surface of the RuSn/ZnO catalyst, two kinds of active sites can be observed: the Ru3Sn7 alloy phase and the SnOx phase. This observation is in accordance with the result obtained by Luo et al. [51]."
8,Reactivity results for the hydrogenation of octanoic acid,"3.2 Reactivity results for the hydrogenation of octanoic acid 3.2.1 Effect of temperature on RuSn/ZnO and Ru/ZnO Fig. 5 shows the conversion of octanoic acid and product selectivity at 30 atm and a WHSV of 2 h−1 as a function of temperature for the RuSn/ZnO and Ru/ZnO catalysts. A narrow temperature range (250–300°C) was used to prevent condensation of the vaporized octanoic acid. Moreover, the decarboxylation or decarbonylation reactions were significantly enhanced at temperatures above 300°C, as can be observed in Figure S3. As observed in Fig. 5, the octanoic acid conversion slightly increases in the lower temperature region and sharply increases to 99.4 % at 300°C over the RuSn/ZnO. The major products are octanol, octanal, and octyl octanoate. The selectivity to octanol steadily increases with an increase in the temperature and reaches its maximum of 93.0 % at 300°C. The selectivity to octanal and octyl octanoate decreases with an increase in the temperature and eventually reaches a minimum of 2.8 and 4.1 % at 300°C, respectively. In contrast, the Ru/ZnO displays astonishingly low activity, in which the conversion of octanoic acid is only 50.4 % and the selectivity to octanol is only 19.0 %. The major product is the octyl octanoate, with a selectivity of 71.2 %. The conversion values obtained in RuSn/ZnO slightly increase in the range of 250-350°C, which is probably caused by the limitation in the internal and external diffusion of the reactants. To confirm this assumption, calculation of internal and external diffusion was carried out by using Weisz-Prater and Mears criterion, respectively. The Weisz-Prater criterion (CWP) and Mears criterion (CM) are defined in the following equations [58, 59]: (6) C W P = − r A ( o b s ) , ρ c R 2 D e C A s < 0.3 (7) C M = − r A ′ ρ b Rn k c C Ab < 0.15 Internal and external mass transfer limitation can be neglected if CWP and CM are below 0.3 and 0.15, respectively. The parameters used to calculate both CWP and CM are summarized in Table S3 and S4. The result of the calculation is shown in Table S5. In the reaction conditions tested in this study, the CWP and CM values are over 0.3 and 0.15, indicating that the reactions are limited by internal and external diffusion. In general, the mass transfer limitation can be omitted at low conversion region, but more equilibrium reactions can occur, which will increase the esterification activity. For this reason, the activity tests were conducted in the high conversion region. Nevertheless, high hydrogenation activity is observed when using RuSn/ZnO as catalyst. In the earlier studies, the active center in bimetallic RuSn was the interaction between Ru metal and SnOx in the form of Ru-SnOx, where Ru provided the hydrogen transfer and SnOx acted as the adsorption site because of its Lewis acidity [49, 50]. In the recent study, the Ru3Sn7 alloy was thought to be the active center for hydrogenation while SnOx catalyzed the esterification [51]. The Sn in Ru3Sn7 alloy acted as the adsorption site for C=O because of its positive charge, while Ru bonded with Cα and provided hydrogen transfer. According to the characterization result, we observed both formation of Ru3Sn7 alloy and SnOx, which is in accordance with the result from recent study. Therefore, the Ru3Sn7 alloy is most likely the active phase for the high hydrogenation activity of octanoic acid and high selectivity to octanol. The result in Fig. 5 also shows that octyl octanoate is formed in the reaction from the esterification between the octanoic acid and octanol. The esterification is higher at lower temperature due to less hydrogenation activity, and it is catalyzed by the SnOx together with the ZnO. The esterification of carboxylic acids over SnOx and ZnO has been reported in several literatures [40, 50, 51, 60-66]. The presence of Lewis acid sites on both SnOx and ZnO are responsible for the adsorption of acids to these sites. However, it should be noted that the esterification does not occur before the preliminary hydrogenation of octanoic acid as it can only proceed in the presence of both octanol and octanoic acid. This means that esterification can be suppressed by optimizing the reaction condition to minimize the remaining amount of octanoic acid. The formation of octyl octanoate through esterification suggests that the octyl octanoate can undergo hydrogenation as well. Pouilloux et al. [50] reported that the hydrogenation of methyl oleate by using RuSnB/Al2O3 as catalyst. In this work, they suggested that interaction of Ru and SnOx worked as the active site for hydrogenation of methyl oleate. Therefore, the hydrogenation of octyl octanoate to form octanol is possible to happen in this study. One method to determine the possibility of octyl octanoate hydrogenation is through kinetic analysis, however, the esterification between octanoic acid and octanol at low conversion region changes the reaction pathway and limits the kinetic analysis. Nevertheless, it is possible that ester hydrogenation also occurs to increase octanol production. Compared to the RuSn/ZnO, Ru/ZnO exhibits a very low activity due to the difference in the reactant adsorption sites between Ru/ZnO and RuSn/ZnO. In the case of Ru/ZnO, the adsorption of octanoic acid occurs on both the Ru and ZnO sites. The adsorption of carboxylic acid on Ru has been observed in several literatures. For example, adsorption of propionic acid on Ru/AC was observed by Vorotnikov et al. [67]. They did DFT modelling for the adsorption of acid on Ru and found that decarbonylation of the acid occurred on bare Ru metal. Similar result was observed by Chen et al. [68]. Meanwhile, the adsorption of several carboxylic acids, such as stearic acid and oleic acid, on the ZnO has been observed by Roberts et al. [69] by FTIR studies. Nagvenkar et al. [65] observed the esterification of acetic acid over ZnO. They found that the Lewis acid sites on ZnO were the preferable active sites for esterification. Therefore, according to these reported literatures, carboxylic acid can adsorb on both Ru and ZnO. The hydrogenation of octanoic acid to octanol over Ru/ZnO is thought to occur on the Ru sites because Ru can provide hydrogen transfer, while esterification is most likely to occur on the ZnO sites. The hydrogenation activity result shows that octyl octanoate is the main product, indicating that at the same reaction condition the formation of octanol is slow, leaving a significant amount of unreacted octanoic acid. As a result, esterification occurred because both reactants were present. Therefore, the conversion value shown in Fig. 5 for Ru/ZnO is the combined hydrogenation and esterification conversion. Fig. 6 shows the reaction pathway for the hydrogenation of octanoic acid over RuSn/ZnO and Ru/ZnO. 3.2.2 Effect of total pressure, H2 partial pressure, and H2 flow rate on RuSn/ZnO Fig. 7 shows the hydrogenation activity of RuSn/ZnO at different total pressures, H2 partial pressure and H2 flow rate. As expected, the total pressure has a significant effect on the hydrogenation of octanoic acid. The octanoic acid conversion steadily increases with an increase in the pressure from 10 to 30 atm. Corresponding to the increase in conversion, the selectivity to octanol also increases from 69.7 to 81.9 %, whereas the selectivity to octanal consistently decreases from 10.9 to 2.3 % with an increase in the pressure (Fig. 7a). However, there is no significant difference in the selectivity to octyl octanoate with an increase in total pressure. The selectivity to octyl octanoate is approximately 20 % in all cases, albeit with a slight decrease at 30 atm. The increase in total pressure significantly increases the partial pressure of hydrogen, which enhances the hydrogenation activity. As a result, a higher octanoic acid conversion and selectivity to octanol are observed. Moreover, the selectivity to octyl octanoate is not significantly affected by the total pressure. Generally, esterification is accelerated with an increase in total pressure [70, 71]. However, it should be noted that esterification occurred immediately after octanol was formed in this case. Thus, at higher pressures, the formation of octyl octanoate is inhibited because of the increase in the hydrogenation activity, which eliminates most of the octanoic acid. Fig. 7(b) shows the effect of the H2 partial pressure at 10 atm. The H2 flow rate was consistently reduced from 100 to 60 mL min−1, which correlates to a reduction in the H2 partial pressure from 9.86 to 5.91 atm. N2 was used as the make-up gas to maintain the total flow rate to 100 mL min−1. The feed flow rate was also set at a constant of 0.01 mL min−1, corresponding to a WHSV of 1 h−1. Notably, the decrease in H2 partial pressure has almost no impact on the conversion of octanoic acid, but it significantly alters the selectivity. The selectivity to octanal and octyl octanoate increases from 17.2 to 22.9 % and from 13.3 to 21.0 %, respectively, with a decrease in the H2 partial pressure. In contrast, the selectivity to octanol decreases notably from 69.5 to 56.1 % with a decrease in the H2 partial pressure. The reduction in selectivity to octanol with a decrease in the H2 partial pressure is attributed to the change in H2 concentration during the reaction. At the same total flow rate, a reduction in H2 partial pressure causes a significant decrease in H2 concentration, which limits the hydrogenation activity. Thus, the selectivity to octanol decreases, whereas that to the intermediates and side products increase. Fig. 7(c and d) show the effects of varying the H2 flow rate at 30 and 10 atm. In this cases, the H2 flow rate was varied from 40 to 100 mL min−1 without balancing the total flow rate to 100 mL min−1 with N2. The WHSV was maintained at 1 h−1 by maintaining the feed flow rate constant at 0.01 mL min−1. At 30 atm, there is no significant difference in the conversion and product selectivity, whereas an increase in conversion and selectivity to octyl octanoate are observed at 10 atm when the H2 flow rate is reduced from 100 to 40 mL min−1. This indicates that H2 flow rate does not affect the hydrogenation activity at high pressure as compared to low pressure. At 10 atm, the conversion increases from 81.3 to 90.3 % and the selectivity to octyl octanoate increases from 13.3 to 19.4 % with a decrease in selectivity to octanal from 17.2 to 10.9 %. The selectivity to octanol remains constant at about 70 %. The increase in conversion along with the increase in selectivity to octyl octanoate indicates that the esterification of octanoic acid and alcohol is enhanced at low H2 flow rate and low pressure. This is supported by the decrease in selectivity to octanal and constant selectivity to octanol. The decreasing H2 flow rate causes reduction in the H2 concentration while increasing the contact time of reactants on the catalyst, thus lowering the hydrogenation activity and increasing the esterification activity. As a result, the formation of octyl octanoate at lower H2 flow rate and low pressure becomes more significant. This effect is not observed at high pressure because of the high H2 partial pressure inside the reactor. Table 2 shows a comparison between the activity of the catalyst presented here and other previously reported catalysts for the hydrogenation of octanoic acid. The RuSn/ZnO catalyst exhibits an exceptional hydrogenation performance resulting in almost complete conversion of octanoic acid and a remarkably high selectivity to octanol under similar reaction conditions as applied in the other reported systems. As described earlier, the major barrier for the use of non-noble metal catalysts is the trade-off between conversion and selectivity, leading to a poor octanol yield because of the relatively low hydrogenation activity of the active metal species. 3.2.3 Evaluation of the long-term hydrogenation activity of RuSn/ZnO The stability test was carried out under full conversion due to minimize the esterification which is the favored reaction route at low conversion range as described previously. Fig. 8 shows the stability test results for the RuSn/ZnO catalyzed hydrogenation of octanoic acid. The stability of the catalyst was tested over 1000 h at 300°C, 30 atm, and a WHSV of 1 h−1. Notably, RuSn/ZnO shows exceptional stability without any significant change in its hydrogenation performance. In a previous study, RuSn/ZnO was tested at 265°C, 25 atm, and a WHSV of 0.9 h−1 over 3500 h without any significant reduction in its hydrogenation performance [52]. The CHNS analysis was conducted to check the coke formation after long-term hydrogenation test. The result shows that the C and H content were 0.35% and 0.04%, respectively, indicating that the formation of coke was negligible even after long-term reaction under such condition. Thus, compared to the previous study, the catalytic activity of RuSn/ZnO was maintained despite the harsher reaction conditions employed in this study."
9,Conclusion,"In this study, the chemoselective hydrogenation of octanoic acid to octanol was successfully conducted over RuSn/ZnO. Up to 99.4 % conversion of octanoic acid and 93.0 % selectivity to octanol were obtained at 300°C, WHSV of 2 h−1, and 30 atm. Comparison with Ru/ZnO activity shows that the difference in the active sites present in both catalysts plays a significant role in determining the hydrogenation activity. The characterization of the catalysts indicates that Ru3Sn7 alloy and SnOx phase were present on RuSn/ZnO surface, whereas Ru/ZnO only contained Ru metal as the active site. The presence of Ru3Sn7 alloy was most likely the active site for hydrogenation in RuSn/ZnO, while SnOx acted as the site for esterification alongside ZnO owing to their Lewis acid sites. The esterification was enhanced in lower temperature and H2 concentration, where octanoic acid and octanol co-existed, but optimizing the reaction conditions to maintain high conversion was the key to limit esterification. The RuSn/ZnO catalyst showed exceptional robustness over 1000 h with no coke formation, indicating that this catalyst is promising for the valorization of medium-chain fatty acids to their value-added derivatives."
