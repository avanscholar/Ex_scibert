0,Introduction,"Currently, fossil energy resources are used extensively to satisfy most of the world’s energy requirements. Projection of energy use and availability suggests that in the near future, there will be major issues and challenges to be faced with energy supply and demand. Additionally, combustion of fossil fuels leads to atmospheric emissions of carbon particles, CO2 and noxious gases such as NOx, SOx. Thus, environmentally friendly fuels, that are both cost-effective and easily storable, are of great importance for the world's sustainable development [1]. Hydrogen is, in this respect, an ideal candidate as an energy vector [2]. Numerous technologies can be used to generate hydrogen. However, only a few of them can be considered as truly environmentally friendly. Steam hydrocarbon reforming is the current dominant technology for hydrogen production. It requires high temperatures (700–1100°C) and emits large amounts of CO2 [3]. Hence, efforts focused on water splitting are of great potential significance. Water splitting using solar energy is one of the most attractive approaches to produce hydrogen. Water splitting is an eco-friendly process that can be operated at ambient temperature and pressure. This process can take advantage from sunlight; an abundant and inexpensive renewable energy source [4–6]. The most important issue still to be addressed is the low quantum efficiency of photocatalytic materials in photocatalytic hydrogen production. This is related with restrictions in band gap excitation as well as recombination of charge carriers in semiconductor photocatalysts. Thus, promoting to low hydrogen evolution rates, which up to date have limited the practical application of this technology on a large scale. In photocatalytic water splitting, photons are absorbed by semiconductors, and as a result, water splits into hydrogen and oxygen. Nevertheless, water splitting is not thermodynamically favourable. Current research focuses on increasing both the efficiency and stability of the materials [7,8]. This is essential to achieve the commercialization of this process [9,10]. Semiconductors are characterized by two types of mobile carriers: a) electrons in the conduction band and b) holes in the valence band. Both bands are separated by an energy gap. There is a continuous transition of electrons between bands. When a valence electron is given an energy equal or greater than the energy band gap, it is transferred to the conduction band, leading to a pair electron-hole formation. When an electron falls from the conduction band into the valence band, and into a hole, a recombination occurs. Among the various semiconductors, TiO2 has been extensively studied due to its photosensitivity, low cost, low toxicity, and good chemical and thermal stability. There are two main issues with TiO2. On one hand, TiO2 can be activated mainly by near ultraviolet irradiation (near-UV) due to its wide band gap (3.20eV for anatase and 3.00eV for rutile), which limits its practical efficiency while using solar energy. In addition, near-UV radiation makes up only 4–5% of the solar spectrum, further reducing its potential applications. On the other hand, a high electron hole recombination reduces the photoelectric conversion efficiency of TiO2. This being one of the main limitations to the practical application of photocatalysis as a viable technology for solar light harvesting [11–32]. TiO2 can be modified with CdS, ZnO, PbS, Cu2O, Bi2S3, and CdSe forming TiO2 composites. Theoretically combining n-type TiO2 with p-type semiconductors is effective in improving the photoelectric TiO2 conversion efficiency. Many of these modified materials have received less attention due to, under illumination in contact with water, they can experience photocorrosion (e.g. Zn2+ or Cd2+ dissolution) [45,47]. A reliable alternative to improving photoelectric conversion is the addition of noble metals (e.g. Pt, Au, Ag and Pd) during the semiconductor synthesis. Noble metals addition favours water splitting given the separation of photoproduced electron-hole pairs because: a) the surface plasmon resonance of noble metal particles can be excited by visible light, (b) the energy band gap is reduced, and c) the noble metal nanoparticles act as electron traps [46]. CREC-UWO research group developed a platinum modified TiO2 photocatalyst [33–36]. Pt modified photocatalysts were evaluated in a Photo-CREC Water-II (PCWII) Reactor using 2% v/v ethanol water acidic solutions (pH=4.00±0.05) under near-UV light irradiation [36]. Low grade ethanol is a renewable carbon containing scavenger. Dissociated water and photon activated semiconductors yield H and OH. Pairs of H radicals combine forming H2, while the ethanol OH scavenger forms CO2, CH4 and C2H6. Under oxygen-free conditions, Quantum Yields (QY) as high as 8% were obtained. Hydrogen was produced in a stable process with no detectable photocatalyst deactivation [36]. The present study considers the use of mesoporous TiO2 with high specific surface area. It is postulated that the high expected mesoporous TiO2 photocatalytic activity can be enhanced with noble metals, such as Pt. Moreover, Pt can trap photogenerated conduction electron, and electron acceptor H+ obtains the electron in order to produce hydrogen on Pt [38–44]. Furthermore, these noble metals display high Schottky barriers and thus favouring electron trapping and charge separation. To demonstrate high photoactivity with noble metals, the performance of these semiconductors should be ranked with a rigorous evaluation of QY."
1,Photocatalyst engineering,"A phenomenological approach for photocatalyst design for hydrogen production involves the followings: a) Semiconductor purity: the highest possible anatase content close to 100%. This appears to enhance under concurrent conversion of an ethanol scavengers, hydrogen production, a) Surface area of the mesoporous TiO2: the highest possible. This can be accomplished with a mesoporous TiO2 with a regular and nanometric pore sizes, c) Crystallite size: the smallest possible with Pt crystallites, consistent with the pore sizes and pore volume of the synthesized mesoporous TiO2. This can lead to a nanometric Pt crystallites and high Pt metal dispersion."
2,Preparation of mesoporous titania nanoparticles,"The copolymer surfactant CH2CH2O-106-CH2(CH3)CHO-70–CH2CH2O-106 (Pluronic F127, MAVG =12600) was used as a structure-directing template. Hydrochloric acid of 37% purity, as well as citric acid and titanium (IV) isopropoxide (Sigma Aldrich Ti(OC3H7)4), were employed as co-reactants. In a typical synthesis, 400mL of ethanol (CH3CH2OH) from Commercial Alcohols (A Trade Name of Greenfield Specialty Alcohols) were acidified with 33.00g of hydrochloric acid (37wt.% purity). After combining these reagents, 20.00g of Pluronic F127 were added, and the suspension was mixed until dissolution (0.5 h). Then, 6.30g of citric acid were incorporated under intense stirring. Following this procedure, the solution pH was adjusted to 0.75. Mixing continued at ambient temperature for 1h. Once this step was completed, 28.50g of titanium (IV) isopropoxide were poured dropwise. The resultant liquid phase, displaying a sol-gel appearance, was mixed for 24h. At the end of this period, it was split in two equal solutions, labelled A and B. The resulting sol-gel phases were evaporated and calcined by gradually increasing the temperature, from room temperature to 773K (500°C) for flask A and to 823K (550°C) for flask B at a 1°C/min heating rate. Once the desired thermal level was reached (i.e. 773K for A and 823K for B), this temperature was kept during 6h under ambient air to calcine the sample and combust the organic template. Synthesis conditions selected secured template-free self-assembled mesoporous titania nanoparticles. Samples obtained following this process were labelled as TiO2- Meso–500°C and TiO2- Meso–550°C, respectively. Given the importance of doping TiO2 with Pt for water splitting [36], the synthesized mesoporous titania of the present study, was also doped with platinum incorporated into the TiO2 lattice. Titanium (IV) isopropoxide template method was modified with the used of hexachloroplatinic acid hydrate (Sigma Aldrich H2PtCl6*xH2O). Titanium (IV) isopropoxide was added in the sol-gel concurrently with the Pt containing species. Prepared samples using the above described steps were designated as: a) 1.00wt.% Pt-TiO2-Meso–500°C and 2.50wt.% Pt-Meso-TiO2–500°C and b) 1.00wt.% Pt- TiO2- Meso–550°C, and 2.50wt.% Pt-TiO2- Meso–550°C."
3,Photocatalytic performance,The photocatalytic activity of the synthesized semiconductors was determined using a Photo-CREC Water-II bench scale photoreactor (PCWII) [36] containing a hydrogen storage tank with jet driving mixing. PCWII is comprised of a 2.65L internally irradiated slurry annular section and a total 6.00L slurry volume. A 15W EIKO T8 Black-Light-Blue (BLB) lamp is the light source. This lamp displays a wavelength peak at 370nm and emits in the range of 320nm–410nm. The photocatalyst loading was evaluated in the range 0.05–1.00g/l in an acid medium (pH=4.00±0.05). A 1.00g of TiO2/Liter loading was used with Pt embedded in the mesoporous TiO2. This was done to ensure that a 90% of the incident energy was absorbed in all experiments. Absolute ethanol was used as a renewable organic scavenger. Ethanol was kept at 2% v/v as reported in our previous studies [36].
4,Experimental set up,"Fig. 1 reports a description of the Photo-CREC Water-II reactor with the following components: (1) 15-W black light lamp or (BLB), (2) Pyrex glass inner tube with a 3.58cm diameter, (4) silica windows, (5) black polyethylene outer tube, (6) stirred tank, (7) centrifugal pump, (8) purging gas injector, and (9) sampling port. 15-W lamp, 1.33cm radius, 41.3cm length, black-light UV lamp is positioned at the center of the inner Pyrex tube, which was selected given its high irradiation transmittance."
5,XRD diffractograms,"Powder XRD spectra were taken on using a Rigaku Rotating Anode X-Ray Diffractometer employing CoKa radiation. The instrument was operated at 45kV and 160mA. X-rays were collimated using 1° divergent and scatter slits, and a 0.15-mm receiving slit. Continuous scans were collected over the 2θ range 20–80° with a step size of 0.02° for a dwell time of 2s per step. One can observe in Fig. 2 that the characteristic crystalline phases for TiO2 are also present in the mesoporous TiO2 calcined at 500°C and 550°C, respectively. Fig. 2 also provides XRD for other TiO2-based photocatalysts doped with platinum, curves (g)–(l). For those cases, the characteristic anatase peaks at the 2θ diffraction angles of 25, 38, 48, 54, 63, 69, 70.5 and 75° corresponding to the planes (101), (004), (200), (105), (204), (116), (220) and (215) were consistently observed. Fig. 2(d) shows small extra peaks for the 1.00wt.%-Pt-Degussa P25 at 27, 36, 55.1 and 57° corresponding to the rutile phase in the planes (110), (101), (211) and (220) respectively. Furthermore, the XRD diffractograms of Fig. 2(i)–(l), for the loadings of 2.50 and 5.00wt.% platinum, in the mesoporous TiO2, report an extra peak at 47° in the 2θ scale. This can be attributed to the Pt, which modifies the TiO2 with an extra crystalline phase. An interesting observation is that when increasing the Pt loading, the 47° peak augments in intensity. Close examination of the peaks in Fig. 2(i)–(l), reveals that two of them occurred for the samples with Pt. These peaks can be attributed to the (111) and (200) reflections of the Pt° (JCPDF 01-1194) possessing a face-centered cubic structure. These peaks are weak and broad, indicating the nanocrystalline nature of the Pt particles. Fig. 2 also shows the effect of the Pluronic and the Pt loading on theTiO2. It is shown that the Pluronic F127-modified mesoporous TiO2 displays a lower crystallinity than that non-porous TiO2 (i.e. 1.00wt.%-Pt/Degussa P25). However, the addition of the Pt increases crystallinity of the mesoporous TiO2. Moreover, an increase in Pt loading leads to higher XRD intensities with a narrowing of the (111) peak, indicating a progressive growth of crystallites. Table 1 reports the crystallite sizes for several TiO2 used, as calculated with the Scherrer equation. The synthesized mesoporous TiO2 displays 8–11nm crystallite sizes. This is in contrast with the 21–22nm for the Degussa P25 and the 48, 51nm for anatase and rutile, respectively."
6,N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of mesoporous TiO2,"In order to establish the structural differences, potentially affecting the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen formation from water splitting, the synthesized mesoporous TiO2 were analyzed using N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and BET method. Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms at −195°C were measured using a Micrometrics ASAP-2010 specific surface area and porosity analyzer. This was accomplished once the mesoporous TiO2 samples were degassed in a vacuum at 250°C for 2h. Figs. 3 and 4 report typical examples of the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms obtained in the present study. Adsorption-desorption isotherm of the synthesized mesoporous materials (Fig. 3) belongs to a Type IV classification [55–57]. This isotherm features a hysteresis loop, associated with capillary condensation in the mesopores, and a limited nitrogen uptake over a range of high P/Po. The initial branch of the isotherm is attributed to a monolayer coverage. Type IV isotherms are found in many mesoporous industrial adsorbents [58]. Additionally, metal dispersion was calculated by pulse chemisorption analysis using a Micrometrics, AutoChem II 2920V 4.00 unit. Through the hydrogen chemisorption analysis one can speculate that the well-dispersed metal particles onto mesoporous TiO2 surface may improve the electron surface distribution. The specific surface area was calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) plot. As shown in Table 2 , typical values obtained for the mesoporous TiO2 were in the 130–170m2/g range. This was significantly higher than the 50m2/g for the commercial Degussa P25 and compared to the 7–8m2/g for anatase and rutile, respectively. In addition, pore size distributions were calculated by employing the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model. The pore volume was measured at P/Po =0.99. Helium gas was used for dead region measurements, whereas nitrogen was utilized to establish sorbed gas. Fig. 5 reports the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution plots, for the synthesized mesoporous semiconductor calcined at 550°C. Fig. 5 shows a bimodal pore size distribution plot. This bimodal pore volume distribution was consistently observed for the following TiO2 based materials: a) Meso-TiO2–500°C, b) Meso-TiO2- 550°C, c) 1.00wt.%-Pt-Meso-TiO2–500°C, d) 1.00wt.%-Pt- Meso-TiO2–500°C,e) 1.00wt.%-Pt-Meso-TiO2–550°C, f) 2.50wt.%-Pt- Meso-TiO2–500°C. These distributions display pore sizes belonging to both 12–15nm range and 30–46nm range. Only one TiO2-based material studied displayed a single pore size distribution, as shown in Fig. 6 . This was found on the 1.00wt.%-Pt- Degussa P25–450°C. Average pore sizes were in the 4-nm range."
7,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),"X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were performed to investigate: a) the concentration of the titanium and platinum in the mesoporous titania, b) species oxidation state and c) their effect on the semiconductor structure (Fig. 7 a and b). The survey spectra for all samples exhibited strong XPS peaks for titanium and oxygen. On this basis meso-TiO2 powders were examined and this to assess the amount of Ti3+ versus Ti4+ ions. Moreover, the chemical state of platinum on the photocatalyst surface was also investigated with platinum species displaying moderate XPS peaks. Additional discussion of the XPS spectra obtained for the Pt-TiO2 photocatalyst are reported in Appendix I. Evidence suggests that synthesis conditions influence TiO2 structural properties. Synthesis conditions must be carefully controlled during photocatalyst synthesis to achieve adequate pore size distribution and high specific surface area. Thus, a successful photocatalyst design with adequate properties for hydrogen production, should encompass key synthesis steps as follows: a) The preparation of 10–40nm mesoporous TiO2 with carefully sized pores. This can be accomplished using sol-gel synthesis and a wisely selected organic template, b) The addition of a platinum precursor in an acidic medium to achieve high platinum dispersion. This can be attained using a stable platinum containing platinic species under acidic conditions, c) The use of a moderate 500–550°C calcination temperature. This leads to Pt in the metallic state directly, and eliminates the requirement of further reduction steps of the photocatalyst."
8,Band gap,"UV–vis spectra of the photocatalysts in solid phase were recorded by a UV–vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV 3600) equipped with an integrating sphere using BaSO4 as a reference. Determination of semiconductor optical band gap is required to determine wavelengths that activate the photocatalyst. To this end, the Kubelka-Munk (K-M) function and the Tauc plot method was used [48]. “Indirect band gap” data treatment designated as the Kubelka-Munk (K-M) and a Tauc plot is highly recommended for the synthesized photocatalysts [49,50]. Fig. 8 reports the UV–vis spectra at various wavelengths, reported at 500°C for different loadings of platinum. Fig. 8 shows that the commercial TiO2 (Degussa P25) displays the highest absorbance values, whereas the prepared mesoporous materials (Meso-TiO2), consistently gives lower absorbance. This shows as well, that Pt loading influences the UV–vis spectra, with reduced absorbance for increased platinum loadings. Furthermore, considering the straight-line approximation and the intersection with the abscissa axis, one can determine larger wavelengths at zero absorbance or the equivalent, a band gap reduction with increased Pt. This finding agrees with the XRD measurements described above, showing new crystalline phases with Pt addition. Fig. 9 reports the UV–vis absorbance as a function of the wavelength for the photocatalyst calcined at 550°C, an increased wavelength at zero absorbance for both Meso-TiO2 and Meso-TiO2 with loaded Pt is observed. Regarding the optical band gaps, the Kubelka-Munk (K-M) function coupled with “indirect” procedure (Tauc plots) was adopted as follows: a) The α h ν variable was selected for the “y” ordinate, with α representing the UV-vis absorbance. b) The hv variable was chosen for the “x” abscissa, with h being the Planck constant (6.63×10−34 Joule/s), c denoting the light speed (3.0×108 m/s) and v = c λ representing the irradiation frequency. On this basis, Tauc plots as in Figs. 10–12 were obtained. Regarding the Tauc plots method, as in Fig. 10, the linear section close to the inflection point region has to be considered according to the Tauc plots method. The resulting straight line provides the equation ( α * h v ) 1 2 =1.9934 (hv)−6.1884, with a 0.996 regression coefficient. Furthermore, the intersection of this straight line with the abscissa axis at ( α * h v ) 1 2 =0, yields Ebg = hv, 1.9934 (E bg )−6.1884=0 and Ebg =6.18/1.99=3.10eV. A similar analysis is developed in Figs. 11 and 12, for the cases of Meso-TiO2–550°C and 2.50wt.% Pt-Meso-TiO2–550°C. The band gaps are 2.99eV and 2.34eV, respectively. Figs. 13 and 14 describe the influence of platinum loading on the optical band gaps for the semiconductors synthesized in this work. Tables 3 and 4 report a comparison of various band gaps for the materials of the presents study, showing the progressive reduction with the increased Pt loadings. Tables 3 and 4 report the optical band gaps for commercial TiO2 (Degussa P25) and Meso-TiO2–500°C and Meso-TiO2–550°C. These results show that the TiO2 architecture has an effect on band gaps, with this being assigned to the higher anatase content of the mesoporous TiO2. Both Tables 3 and 4 also show that the band gap is consistently reduced by the Pt loading. One can notice that there is a consistent band gap reduction with platinum loading. Furthermore, the higher calcination temperature of 550 °C, provides a slightly enhanced λbg. Thus, on the basis of the above, one can conclude that the platinum added mesoporous materials are able to more effectively use the visible light. A quantification of this enhanced visible light irradiation can be accounted for using the following equation: (1) V i s i b l e U t i l i z e d I r r a d i a t i o n % ( VUI ) = ∫ λ min λ b g I d λ ∫ λ min λ max I d λ x 100 % with I being the irradiance, λmin and λmax representing the minimum and the maximum wavelengths of solar irradiation and λbg denoting the wavelength associated to the measured optical band gap. Both Tables 3 and 4 report the expected VUI% which is increased up to 36%–43%, as a result of Pt addition."
9,Scanning electron microscopy (SEM),"SEM micrographs of mesoporous TiO2 photocatalysts with different Pt loadings are shown in Fig. 15 . One can observe, the Pt-TiO2 powders under calcination at 550°C exhibit increased grain and pore sizes. This may be explained due to calcination at 550°C improved the crystallinity of TiO2 materials and correspondingly the combustion of Pluronic F127 promoted increasing pore size."
10,Hydrogen production via water splitting,"Experiments of hydrogen formation via photocatalytic water splitting were performed using the Photo-CREC Water-II Reactor (refer to Fig. 3). This unit was used with a specially designed H2 collector tank and a BLB lamp that permits the entire use of the near-UV light irradiation spectrum. 2v/v% ethanol (EtOH) as a hole (h+) was employed as a scavenger. This research also took advantage of the mesoporous semiconductor material of TiO2 and its modifications with Pt conveniently reduced optical band gap. Experiments in the Photo-CREC Water-II Reactor also allowed determining the production of different intermediates and by-products such as: 1) liquid phase: CH3COOH and 2) gas phase: forms CO2, CH4 and C2H6 under oxygen free conditions. These were formed during photocatalytic hydrogen generation. Fig. 16 shows that in all cases, there is a steady hydrogen increase throughout the entire run with no observable photocatalyst activity decay. Experiments in the Photo-CREC Water-II Reactor showed a major growth in H2 production when Pt is added in the mesoporous TiO2 at 2.5wt.%. Hydrogen generation with an ethanol scavenger proceeds consistently via a similar redox network path yielding CH3COOH, H2O2, CH4, C2H6, and CO2."
11,Quantum yields (QYs),"The comparison of the performance of TiO2 semiconductors for hydrogen production needs a rigorous assessment of QY [51–54]. The adequate definition of QYs requires macroscopic energy balances allowing Qabs to be measured. The so-called quantum yield is defined as the ratio of the moles of photons effectively converted into products to the moles of absorbed photons. Thus, QY can be calculated as follows: (2) Q Y = 2 M o l e s o f H 2 P r o d u c e d / s M o l e s o f P h o t o n s A b s o r b e d / s In this calculation, the photons absorbed (Pa) were calculated using macroscopic balances taking into account for incident, transmitted and reflected photons [36,37]. The number of Einstein effectively converted in hydrogen production can be easily calculated as twice the moles of hydrogen formed, due to two electrons are needed to produce one hydrogen molecule. A significant increase, from the 7.9% of the previous QY values reported by Escobedo et al. [36], to the 9.6% and to the 22.6% QY values for 1wt.%-Pt-TiO2-Meso–550°C and 2.50wt.%-Pt-TiO2-Meso–550°C photocatalysts is observed, respectively. These QY enhancements are assigned to the favourable influence of mesoporous architectures of the synthesized semiconductors in the present study. Table 5 reports the QY (%) of the semiconductors prepared in this study. The 2.50wt.%-Pt- TiO2-Meso–550°C displays a 22.6% QY, about 6 times greater than that for bare DP25 displaying only a 3.5% QY. Appendix II reports additional clarifications concerning the QYs calculations. Thus, and in the basis of results obtained in the present study, one can establish that doped Pt in mesoporous TiO2, using near UV irradiation and ethanol as a scavenger, can yield considerably enhanced QY for hydrogen production from water splitting. It is our view that the proposed mesoporous TiO2-Pt data may be most valuable for the engineering of scaled up photoreactors for hydrogen production."
12,Conclusions,"a) The mesoporous photocatalysts of the present study, prepared by a sol-gel method, display large surface areas and a bimodal pore size distribution. b) These mesoporous photocatalysts have a dominant anatase crystalline phase and show a decrease of the band gap with Pt addition. c) These semiconductors are shown to display a zero-order reaction for hydrogen production with this being true for all photocatalysts studied. d) Hydrogen formation is proven to increase with Pt loading when using ethanol at 2% v/v concentration. This shows the very important role played by Pt reducing the semiconductor band gap and trapping the electrons generated. e) The synthesized Pt-mesoporous semiconductors are shown to display promising QYs of 22.6% for the 2.5wt.% Pt-TiO2-Meso."
