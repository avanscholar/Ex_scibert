0,Introduction,"At present, most energy required by human beings comes from fossil fuels, which are not renewable. At the same time, the burning of traditional fossil fuels produces many pollutants, such as NOx, soot, CO2 etc., which not only endanger human health, but also have a great impact on climate change [1–8]. Currently, the clean fuels such as biomass fuel [3,4] and hydrogen [9–11] are being increasingly used to gradually replace hydrocarbon fuels to control the emission of soot. However, due to difficulties in manufacturing and transportation, hydrogen is often mixed with other hydrocarbon fuels to increase the energy density of the fuel, improve the combustion stability and reduce soot emission. The influence of hydrogen addition on soot formation has drawn a lot of attention [12–17]. Soot formation is a very complex process, including fuel pyrolysis, the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), soot nucleation, surface growth, oxidization, and coalescence [18]. The soot nucleation process is regarded as the key step in converting gaseous PAHs into nascent soot particles. At present, there are four conceptual paths for the soot nucleation process [18–21]: (1) PAH, such as pyrene, grows along its edge and eventually forms a three-dimensional and space-curled fullerene-like structure through the formation of pentacarbonyl rings. However, the reaction rate predicted by this pathway within the H-abstraction-C2H2-addition (HACA) mechanism is much slower than that observed experimentally. (2) PAH reacts with aryl radicals to form three-dimensional structure. It is important when H atoms are abundant in flames, but cannot explain why nucleation occurs in the post-flame region where H atoms are less. (3) The nascent particles of stacked structure are formed by physical nucleation collision of PAH monomers. However, these polymers are thermodynamically unstable at higher flame temperatures (above 1600 K). For surface growth, the main mechanism used is HACA. In addition, the mechanism of carbon-addition-H-migration (CAHM) is proposed [18–19,22–24]. A variety of soot models were used to describe the process of soot formation [25–30], including empirical models, semi empirical models, detailed soot models, as well as methods with particle distribution. The nucleation models in these models mainly include pyrene dimerization model and the collision model of various PAHs [31]. The surface growth models are mainly based on HACA and CAHM mechanisms [18]. Due to the experimental limitations and the deficiency of traditional numerical simulations, the soot models are still inadequate to depict detailed chemical reaction mechanisms, and the elementary reaction details during the soot evolution process, including nucleation and surface growth, are difficult to directly obtained [32,33]. Experimental results have shown that the formation rate and concentration distribution of soot particles in ethylene flames can be reduced through dilution and chemical effects after H2 addition [13,34]. Liu et al. [35,36] concluded that lower concentrations of acetylene, C3H3 and pyrene in hydrogen-ethylene flames make soot nucleation rate lower through a numerical simulation, which could be the origin of the chemical inhibition effects. However, the simulation only studied the changes of acetylene, C3H3 and pyrene in the reaction process. For hydrogen addition, the detailed mechanism of chemical reaction pathways, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon cyclization, soot nucleation and subsequent growth, are elucidated. ReaxFF, a special reactive force field of molecular dynamic simulation (MD) developed by van Duin et al. [37,38], has been widely applied to complex chemical reaction processes [39,40]. ReaxFF is a general bond-order-dependent force field that can smoothly describe the bond breakage and bond formation among molecules in a system [41–43]. The ReaxFFCHO [44] force field can simulate well the oxidation behavior of hydrocarbons in the combustion process, and the subsequent force field has been revised for condensed carbon [45]. The reaction force field of the Si/C/H/O system reported in Yoon’s work [46] fits well the chemical reaction pathways and mechanical properties of carbon-containing materials. Yuan [47] simulated the process of the initial formation of soot particles from PAHs at different temperatures and found that direct carbon addition should not be neglected, especially at lower temperatures. Under the conditions of high temperature and high concentration of free radicals, the HACA mechanism played a key role in soot nucleation. Han et al. [48] presented a long time ReaxFF MD of fuel-rich combustion for up to 10 ns and it revealed three stages of initial ring formation, nucleation and graphitization by fuel molecules: (1) large ring was generated from activated aliphatic polyene-like chains, (2) nucleation of a nanoparticle was the result of coagulation of PAH-like molecules, accompanied by ring closure reactions that occurred at side chains of the PAHs-like molecules, and (3) graphitization of the nanoparticle was dominated by the transformation of C5/C7 rings to C6 rings with C3 rings as intermediates. In conclusion, the ReaxFF MD simulation can be used to gain fundamental insights into nucleation, surface growth, and graphitization of soot particles. In this work, pyrene acetylene, benzopyrene and other large typical PAH precursors from the ethylene flames under different amounts of hydrogen molecules were selected to explore the nucleation of PAHs and the growth and graphitization of initial soot particles, aiming to reveal the key factors and reaction mechanism under conditions relevant to ethylene diffusion flames with hydrogen addition. To speed up the reaction processes, the present ReaxFF simulations were conducted at temperatures much higher than those of fuel/air flames. It is recognized that the simulation conducted at a significantly higher temperature may not fully reflect the chemical reactions at flame temperatures. Even so, ReaxFF MD results at higher temperatures are still highly useful to improve our fundamental understanding of soot inception and early growth. In future work, ReaxFF MD simulations at flame temperatures will be conducted to better reveal the processes of soot inception and early growth in hydrocarbon/air flames and the results will be reported in the near future."
1,Methods,
2,PAH precursor selection,"2.1 PAH precursor selection According to literature reports [49,50], soot particles are formed by clusters of PAHs. The most abundant molecular mass range of PAH monomers was found to be 202–472 amu by means of laser microprobe mass spectrometry [51,52] (LAMMS) under flame conditions. Due to the high computational cost of ReaxFF MD simulations, existing studies of soot inception using ReaxFF MD are often limited to several widely recognized single components. In order to get as close to real flame conditions as possible, we adopted the CoFlame program to conduct numerical calculations of laminar coflow ethylene/air diffusion flames under different amounts of hydrogen addition using a detailed combustion chemistry model with PAH formation up to five-ring species. This model assumes that two pyrene molecules collide to form dimers, as the inception of the initial soot particles. An examination of the CoFlame results of the soot nucleation area showed that the most abundant small-molecule hydrocarbons and PAHs were acetylene and Benzo (ghi)-fluoranthene (A4R), followed by Pyrene-acetylene (A4C2H), and the OH radical was an important intermediate component that affects the reaction path of H2 and promotes the oxidation of soot particles. In addition, in order to advance the process of PAHs dimerization, some researchers using ReaxFF MD mostly adopted pyrene [40,53], benzo (a)-pyrene [47], coronene [48] and other macrocyclic PAHs structures for model simplification. Therefore, benzo (a)-pyrene (A5) was added in this work to shorten the reaction process. Cyclopentadienyl (C5H5) was selected to explore whether acetylene could drive it to generate and grow the first benzene ring [52]. The scale of this model was 1560–2070 atoms, which is suitable for rapid simulation of ReaxFF MD. The PAH monomer structure included in the model is shown in Fig. 1 ."
3,Simulation strategies,"2.2 Simulation strategies The formation process of soot particles is complex and influenced by temperature, density (pressure), fuel properties and other conditions. To study the effects of temperature and density, this work simulated the model without hydrogen doping under the conditions of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 g/cm3 in the temperature range of 1660–3060 K, so as to determine the optimal temperature and density for the system with hydrogen addition. Then, different amounts of hydrogen were added to the system to explore the effect of hydrogen on the growth of PAHs and the formation of initial soot particles. The simulated operating conditions are listed in Table 1 ."
4,Simulation steps and details,"2.3 Simulation steps and details Before the ReaxFF MD simulation, geometry optimization was made by the Forcite module in the Materials Studio software to stabilize each PAH monomer. A box was constructed using the Amorphous cell module, and geometry optimization was carried out again with a COMPASSII force field until energy converged. Then, a dynamic simulation of the canonical ensemble (NVT) was performed for system equilibrium at 5 K, followed with an energy minimization to stretch the molecular structures and prevent large fluctuations of energy caused by an over-dense arrangement of atoms [54]. Both the equilibrium process and NVT-MD simulation were performed using a time step of 0.1 fs. The temperature was controlled by Nose-Hoover with a damping constant of 0.1 ps. The ReaxFF force field in the large-scale atom/molecule parallel simulator (LAMMPS) package was used to simulate the MD process [55] and the detailed chemical reactions were obtained with the aid of Materials Studio snapshots [56] and Ovito tracks. Fig. 2 shows the methodology flow chart."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Temperature effect,"3.1 Temperature effect Model without hydrogen addition. In order to determine the appropriate high temperature conditions in the ReaxFF MD and characterize the formation process of the initial soot particles in hydrocarbon fuel, the evolution of the number density and percentage of initial soot particles in the system given in Table 1 was analyzed. Frenklach et al. [57] used MD to simulate how two pyrene molecules collide to form a dimer in a real flame. A large number of numerical simulations [58,59] and quantitative calculations [21,60] also simplified the soot formation as the dimerization of two PAH precursors. Since the minimum PAHs (A4C2H) carbon number selected in this work is 18, it is assumed for statistical convenience that when the carbon number of the molecule is greater than 36, the dimerization of the PAHs occurs, resulting in the formation of initial soot particles. Actually, the reaction rate of the PAH dimers with each other in the early stage was greater than that of the small molecule hydrocarbon chain growth rate, which suggests the C atoms of almost all the hydrocarbons in chain growth has not yet reached 36 before they formed a PAH-like structure or combined with the surface of the soot particles. Thus, this statistical method is reasonable. The percentage composition of soot particles was based on the ratio of the mass of the molecular fragments containing more than 36 carbons to the total molecular mass in the box [39,54], and the number density was statistically analyzed by the ratio of the number of initial soot particles to the volume of the box. Fig. 3 shows the morphology of the maximum soot particles formed in the system without adding hydrogen at different temperatures at 1 ns (Table 1: Case B). Temperature significantly affected the rate of the chemical reactions and accelerated the coagulation of PAHs to form soot particles. At 1660 K, it was observed that there were a large number of dimer/trimer structures in the system at the early stage. With the increase of temperature, the coagulation process of the initial soot particles was accelerated, and a larger particle was formed. When the temperature increased to 2660 K, only one soot particle was formed at 1 ns and the surface growth and structural rearrangement occurred afterwards. The soot particle gradually evolved into a regular spherical structure, that is, entered the graphitization stage. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 4 that the number density and percentage of soot particles in the low-temperature stage (1660–1960 K) change relatively slowly. When the simulation time is extended to 1.4 ns, the peak soot percentage reaches 49%, 37.5%, 37% and 37% and the peak number density reaches 0.10, 0.08, 0.09, and 0.09 N/m3 at 1660, 1760, 1860, and 1960 K, respectively, which is still in the early stage of the formation of soot particles. When the temperature rises to 2560 K, the number density drops to 0.01 N/m3 at around 1.2 ns, marking the formation of a single soot particle in the system, although the percentage composition raised quickly to just 75% when the reaction time was between about 1.2 to 1.4 ns, showing that the surface growth of the soot particle dominated instead of graphitization (graphitization in detail below). As shown in Fig. S3, by extending the reaction time, the H/C ratio of the only soot particle decreases continuously, which suggests that the soot particle entered the graphitization stage. Within 2660–3060 K, the number density shows a trend of decline after first rising, and all drop to 0.01 N/m3 within 1 ns. The soot percentage reaches around 80% rapidly and tends to be stable. These results showed that the surface growth reaction began to be balanced and the rearrangement reaction was the main process. By simulating the 2560 K condition for a long time and comparing it with the higher temperature, the influencing factors of the soot formation could be qualitatively studied, since the chemical reaction path was not significantly affected. Therefore, to save the calculation costs and uncover the dominate chemical reaction pathway of the soot formation and the graphitization stage, the temperature of 2660–3060 K was selected as the high temperature condition in this work to study the effect of adding hydrogen on the soot formation. Model with hydrogen addition. Through the above analysis the formation process of PAH precursors can be roughly divided into three stages. The first stage is the growth and dimerization of PAHs, namely the nucleation of initial soot particles. During this period, the number density increases to the peak, and the mass percentage of the soot particles increases rapidly. The second stage is the coagulation process of the soot particles, where the polymer becomes larger, leading to a gradual decrease in the number density and a slow increase in soot mass percentage. In the third stage, according to the simulation trajectory (Fig. 6), the largest and most unique soot particle in the system had been formed and continued structural evolution, namely in the graphitization stage (other conditions are given in Fig. S8). Fig. 5 shows the number density and mass percentage evolution of soot particles formed with 0, 90, 180, 270 initial hydrogen molecules in the system at temperatures of 2660–3060 K (Table 1: Case B). The number density of soot particles in each system first increases to a peak, and then gradually drops to 0.01 N/nm3 (only one soot particle in the system). The mass percentage of soot particles increases rapidly at first, and then slowly increases to a certain value and remained stable. It is worth mentioning that in the system without hydrogen addition, although the number density peak appears earlier with the increased temperature, it doesn’t show a significant decline. With increasing the hydrogen molecules, the number density shows an obvious downward trend at higher temperature. The decrease trend is most pronounced in the system with addition of 270 hydrogen molecules, the peak values are 0.12, 0.09, and 0.08 N/nm3 at 2660, 2860, and 3060 K. These results indicate that the effect of adding hydrogen to the system on soot formation is greater than that due to the temperature change from 2660 to 3060 K."
7,Hydrogen effect,"3.2 Hydrogen effect 3.2.1 Overall evolution Evolution of number density and percentage composition of soot particles. Because increasing the temperature between 2660 and 3060 K had little effect on the role of hydrogen addition, 3060 K was selected to conduct a detailed analysis on the initial soot formation with different amounts of hydrogen addition to shorten the calculation time. Fig. 7 shows the statistical and regression analysis results of the maximum number density as well as the soot mass percentage in different systems of different initial hydrogen molecules. The mass percentage of the final soot particle is highly correlated with the initial amount of hydrogen: the more hydrogen added, the lower the soot mass percentage. This is because the addition of hydrogen prevents the surface growth processes of soot particles. When hydrogen addition is small (30–90 molecules), the maximum number density rapidly decreases from 0.11 N/nm3 to 0.09 N/nm3, and then enters a gradual leveling off period. In addition, the particle–particle collisions are also delayed, which are 136.4, 141.6, 174.7, 161.1, 149.7, 174.8, and 231.4 ps when the added hydrogen molecules were 0, 30, 45, 60, 90, 180, and 270, respectively (Fig. S6). The results show that the addition of hydrogen could inhibit the coagulation process of the PAH precursors, resulting in a decrease in the peak number density. Regression analysis was conducted on the production of hydrogen and, as shown in Fig. 8 , the more initial hydrogen molecules were added, the lower the relative amount of hydrogen generated in the final system. It showed a high negative correlation: 175 hydrogen molecules were eventually generated in the system without initially adding hydrogen, while only 53 hydrogen molecules were generated when 270 hydrogen molecules were added to the system, which was more than three times lower. The above analysis shows that adding hydrogen can reduce the dehydrogenation reaction and effectively inhibit the formation and growth of initial soot particles. Evolution of the number of small molecular fragments. In the simulation conducted by Yuan et al. [47], it was found that small molecular radicals, such as OH and C2H, are important intermediates that promote PAH activity and condense into polymers at high temperature, but the reaction mechanism was not analyzed fully. Therefore, this paper tracked the pathways of PAHs attacked by small molecules, such as an OH radical, aiming to reveal the detailed mechanism of the coalescence reactions of PAH-like molecules. Fig. 9 shows the overall reaction evolution of the OH radicals in Case A at 3060 K. The OH radicals were rapidly consumed at the initial stage of the reaction. Some of them reacted with H atoms to form H2O while others attacked the PAH precursors and C1–C4 small-molecule species, making them decarbonize to form CO. After 100 ps, a large number of highly active PAHs and small molecular radicals existed in the system, providing conditions for the growth and nucleation of PAHs. In addition, a special type of OH radicals attack on PAHs were also observed in the simulation, as shown in Fig. 10 , where two OH free radicals add on the side chain directly (Fig. 10a), resulting in the carbon atoms being out of balance and connected with the adjacent carbon atom to form a three-ring structure (Fig. 10b). After a period of time, the aromatic ring opened (Fig. 10c) and one OH radical caused three carbon atoms to fall off the aromatic ring to form an alcohol aliphatic radical (Fig. 10d). Then, the alcohol aliphatic hydrocarbon radical removes a carbon atom to form CO, and the OH radical on the side chain of the PAHs dehydrogenates the connected carbon atom to form a closed pentacyclic aldehyde structure (Fig. 10f). It can be inferred that the OH radicals attack PAHs to open the aromatic rings at the initial stage, which can improve their activity and promote dimerization. As shown in Fig. 11 (b), the consumption rate of OH radicals increase rapidly with the addition of hydrogen. When adding 0, 45, 60, 90, 180, 270 H2 molecules, the total consumption time of the OH radicals are approximately 45, 44, 44, 40, 36, 40 ps, respectively. This may be due to the increased probability of reaction between hydrogen and OH radicals, leading to more production of H2O (Fig. 11a) and H radicals (Eq. (1)) or H3O+ (Eq. (2)) at the initial stage. This in turn decreased the probability of OH attacking the PAH precursor (Fig. 11c), which may reduce the activity of the PAHs and decrease the number density of soot particles during the first stage. After 100 ps, the amount of H2O begins to decrease. It was found that the H2O reacted with C radicals and generated CO and H2, which corresponded to the rising of CO (Fig. 12 b, Eq. (3)). Along with the increase in hydrogen, the generation time of methane is also obviously (Fig. 12a) advanced. When the added hydrogen molecules were increased to 270, the amount of methane reached 50. Table 2 lists the methane formation paths observed under condition of 180 hydrogen molecules, from which it can be seen that the H2, on one hand, removes C atoms from aromatic hydrocarbons or small molecules to form CH-like radicals and, on the other hand, methanides with CO under the hydrogen rich conditions [61]. Besides, intermediates such as the C2–C4 species (in Fig. S7) showed a dramatic rise and then a decrease. We can infer that hydrogen can promote C2–C4 species formation and cleave into a C1 hydrocarbon, which restricts the increase of C atoms on the surface and growth of soot particles. (1) OH + H 2 → H 2 O + H · (2) OH + H 2 → H 3 O + · (3) H 2 O + C · → CO + H 2 · 3.2.2 Physical and chemical properties of the largest molecule H/C ratio. In this section, the C number of the largest molecules formed during the soot nucleation process, was used to study the evolution of initial soot particles and to characterize the soot nucleation process in the simulation. The H/C ratio of the largest soot particle is a crucial factor in describing its properties. It is generally believed [52,54] that the H/C ratio of young soot particles is greater than 0.2, while that of mature soot particles is as low as 0.05, and even as low as 0.02 for fullerenes. As shown in Fig. 13 , the number of C atoms in the largest soot particle suddenly increases during the first stage (0–150 ps), to 200 until 150 ps. The number of C6 rings in the largest soot particle increases slowly, and there are hardly any C5 or C7 rings (Fig. 14 ), indicating that PAH monomers grows into dimers or trimers. During the second stage (150–400 ps), the number of C atoms continues to increase to 812, but the formation rate is slower than that in the first stage. It can be seen from Fig. 14 that the number of C5/C6/C7 rings increases rapidly before 400 ps and slows down during 400–800 ps. At the end of the second stage, the number of C5/C6/C7 rings increases to 64, 225, 49, respectively. It can suggest that a coagulation of large molecules occurred. During the third stage (400–1000 ps), the largest soot particle grows slowly, and the C5/C6/C7 rings begin to reach a plateau period. This may be caused by a graphitization reaction: the initial soot particles joined into one and undergo structural change. During the graphitization process, the dehydrogenation reaction continues, and the mutual transformation between the C5/C6/C7 rings make the structure of the soot particle more regular, transforming from a complex network structure to a hemispherical particle structure with a smooth surface (Fig. 6). In addition, the H/C ratio decreases continuously to 0.09 at the end of the reaction. This phenomenon is consistent with the results of the experiment in a premixed flame and a simulation by Han et al., in which the H/C ratio of the soot formation area decreased to 0.1. The properties of the largest soot particles at different temperatures are shown in Fig. S4. Fig. 15 shows the evolution of the C atoms in the largest soot particle formed in the system under different hydrogen addition conditions. The largest soot particles are formed in each system around 400 ps, and the number of carbon atoms decreases gradually with increased hydrogen content. As shown in Fig. 16 , it is obvious that the C number of the largest soot particle increases to 860 at 1000 ps in Case A, while the number is 745 when 270 hydrogen molecules were added, reducing by 115 carbon atoms. It is worth noting that the H/C ratio of the largest soot particle gradually increases when the number of initial hydrogen molecules is 0 to 180, but when the hydrogen molecules increase to 270, the H/C ratio rapidly decreases to 0.09. This may be because the increase in the C1–C4 species causes H2 to react, producing a large amount of methane. Density of the largest soot particle. Figs. 17 and 18 show the variation of the density and H atoms of the largest soot particle at 100 ps intervals. The maximum molecular density was solved according to van der Waals volume [52,62]. At the initial stage, the density of the PAHs fluctuates around 1.7–1.8 g/cm3, and rapidly increases during the second stage, which corresponds to the dimerization and polymerization growth of PAHs and a large number of dehydrogenation reactions. At the third stage, the density of the largest soot particle changes to stabilize around 2.0–2.2 g/cm3. This result shows that the maximum molecular structure and its H/C ratio has an effect on its density, which is roughly consistent with the calculated density value (1.8–2.0 g/cm3) of soot particles in the literature [63]. Hydrogen addition inhibits the dehydrogenation of soot particles. The amount hydrogen in the largest soot particle in Case B shows an overall upward trend compared with that in Case A, while the density of the largest soot particle shows an overall downward trend. Combined with Fig. 15, it can be seen that hydrogen can significantly inhibit the growth of soot particles and the structural rearrangement in the graphitization stage, resulting in reduced density and final mass reduction. Final morphology of the largest soot particle. Fig. 19 shows the final morphology of the largest soot particles in the system under different hydrogen addition conditions. The largest soot particle formed in the system without hydrogen addition shows an irregular hemispherical structure with only a few branch chains on the surface, which is relatively smooth (Fig. 6). In Fig. 19, when the number of H2 added is 30, one part of the soot particle is in a semi-spherical stacked structure, while the other part formed a nearly planar network structure, and the H/C ratio increases to 0.085. When the number of added H2 is 45, the stack structure gradually shrinks, forming a large planar network structure, and there are more branch chains on its surface, with an H/C ratio of 0.087. When the number of hydrogens added is 60, the network structure of the soot particle is long and thin in the middle, with small hemispherical concave structures on both sides. The network structure becomes very irregular when the number of added hydrogen molecules reaches 90. As the box has periodic boundaries, aromatic rings on both sides are stacked in a disorderly manner. The H/C ratio continues to rise close to 0.11. When the number of added H2 reaches 180, the final morphology of the largest soot particle once again shows a large area of a flat mesh surface, accompanied by a small portion of tubular structure. When the system initially contains 270 H2, the morphology of the largest soot particle changes from a mesh structure to a tire-like structure, and the H/C ratio also decreases from 0.125 to 0.09. According to the final morphology map of the largest soot particles in the system, adding a certain amount of hydrogen can slow down the transformation of a soot particle from a network to a spherical structure, and inhibit the graphitization stage. However, the difference is that, when the number of the added hydrogen increased to a certain number (270), the largest soot particle formed a tire-like hemispheric structure. Combined with the H/C ratio in Fig. 16, this phenomenon may suggest that adding enough hydrogen molecules can increase the size of the box to maintain the constant initial density, leaving enough room for the soot particles to bend and deform, which may indicate that excessive hydrogen can promote the formation of branched chains and easily form internal bridging or structural rearrangement, evolving from the mesh structure to the tire-like structure. 3.2.3 Initial chemical reaction pathway for soot nucleation Through the above analysis, the formation process of the initial soot particle can be divided into three stages. Using the Materials studio and Ovito visualization program, the system’s evolution can be observed, and the chemical reaction pathway of soot nucleation formed at different stages can be analyzed in detail. Effect of H2 on PAHs activity. In this work, the formation of the initial soot particles starts from the dimerization of the PAH precursors. In Case A, it was observed that acetylene lose H atoms to form acetenyl, and then added to the active sites of the PAHs to realize the growth and nucleation of the PAHs. In addition, it was also observed that OH radicals could attack PAHs in a dehydrogenation reaction, increasing the activity of the PAHs and promoting dimerization. However, with an increase in the initial hydrogen content, the OH radicals were rapidly consumed to produce H2O, and the pathway of attack of the PAHs was different. Fig. 20 shows the detailed reaction pathway of H2 attacking A5 a under the addition of 180 hydrogen molecules. The H atom in H2 was added at one site of the C6 ring with PAH (Fig. 20a), and then the C–C bond broke between two adjacent C atoms. After the aromatic ring opened (Fig. 20c), the surrounding hydrogen continued to preemptively attack the active site, leading to the removal of one side chain and the formation of an acetaldehyde-like molecule (Fig. 20e), but the C–C bond on the other side chain remained saturated. The reaction pathways of the other PAHs attacked by H2 and OH radicals are given in Table 3 . After H atoms were added to the active site of the PAHs, they were not occupied by acetylene to realize the growth of PAHs, that is, the HACA mechanism. However, the adjacent C atoms were mostly attacked by hydrocarbons such as the acetylene group, leading to the continuous extension of the side chain and the growth time. Thus, the extended side chains are susceptible to attack by H2 or oxidative removal of excess OH from the actual flame. In particular, the reaction time of surface growth and coagulation of the PAHs with H2 addition (Case B) was longer than that of without H2 addition (Case A), indicating that H2 could inhibit the reaction process better than OH radicals. Growth and coagulation of PAHs. The dehydrogenation reactions and attacks by OH radicals at high temperatures increased the number of active sites on the PAH precursors and promoted mutual coagulation under chemical reactions. There are three main coagulation modes observed in the simulation. One is through the CAHM mechanism, in which a carbon atom on the acetylene directly adds on the pyrene, without going through dehydrogenate first. In the other, the PAH precursors lose a hydrogen atom to form an active site, and then small molecular hydrocarbons, such as acetylene or polyacetylene, are added to the active site, which is consistent with the HACA mechanism. In addition, the simulation also observed other growth patterns. The side-chain growth of the PAH precursors formed a macrocyclic structure, which was then connected with other PAHs and bridges within the rings to form a stable structure, such as a five or six carbon ring. This phenomenon is similar to the simulation results of Han et al. Fig. 21 records two types of dimerization growth of PAH precursors. One shows two A4 molecules connected with an ethynyl to form a dimer, in which the aromatic ring loses stability and the C–C bond is broken, then an unsaturated carbon atom and ethynyl form an eight carbon ring structure with bond breaking and binding, and finally form a dimer with two five carbon rings and a six carbon ring. The other shows the process of extending the side chain of a trimer and then bonding with the adjacent aromatic ring to form a five-carbon ring. Fig. 22 shows the formation and evolution of initial soot particles under the addition of 180hydrogen molecules (other conditions are given in Fig. S8). To distinguish the H atoms in the PAHs, all H atoms in the added H2 are marked in blue. It was observed from the trajectory that a large amount of hydrogen distributed around the PAHs during the total stage, inhibiting the dehydrogenation reaction, which is consistent with experimental observations [9]. Fig. 23 shows the number of C–H bonds and C–C bonds under different hydrogen addition conditions. With an increase of H2, the breakage rate of the C–H bonds gradually decreases, while the C–C bonds shows an opposite trend within 200 ps, indicating that a large amount of H2 promotes the decarbonization of PAHs to form small aliphatic hydrocarbons at the early stage of the reaction. Thus, the number of C–C bonds decreases rapidly, while the number of C–H bonds decreases slowly. After 200 ps, the initial soot particles are agglomerated, and the number of C–C bonds increases rapidly in Case A, while growing slowly with an initial hydrogen content. This suggests that hydrogen could effectively inhibit the formation of C–C bonds on the surface of soot particles. Besides, adding hydrogen can significantly affect the morphology of the largest soot particle, as can be seen in Fig. 19. As more hydrogen was added, the network surface structure of the soot particle became more pronounced, which may be due to hindered surface growth of the soot particle by the addition of H atoms to the active site of the aromatic ring during the soot nucleation process and delaying the structural rearrangement of the graphitization stage (Fig. 24 ). Graphitization of the soot nanoparticle. The H/C ratio of the largest soot particle in Case A dropped to 0.2 and began to enter the initial stage of graphitization. This stage lasted until the end of the simulation, occupying two thirds of the entire reaction time, similar to experiments reported in the literature [64]. At this stage, the number of surface growth reactions between the soot nanoparticles and the small hydrocarbon molecules decreased, but still existed due to defect sites at the edges of the soot particle. In order to compare the evolution in Cases A and B, Fig. 25 shows all the reaction types of the largest soot nanoparticles in Case A (571–572 ps) and Case B under addition of 180 hydrogen molecules (741–742 ps) when the H/C ratio reached the same value of 0.15. There were seven main types of reactions in the graphitization stage of soot particles in Case A and structural rearrangement was very active. The macrocyclic compounds could transform into small rings (type 3) through intra-ring bridging and formation, and the small rings could transform into unstable large rings with internal bond fractures (type 1), which suggests that the growth of soot particles is reversible. At the same time, it was also observed that the reticulated aromatic ring was continuously deformed and extruded during the reaction process and finally formed a highly complex three-dimensional hinged aromatic ring (type 6). In Case B, the aromatic ring bridging reaction was observed only twice (type 4 and type 6). One was the three-carbon ring formed by bridging inside the four-carbon ring, and the other was the C–C bond formed by the fracture of a carbon atom in the five-carbon ring to a carbon atom in the adjacent large ring, thus forming a six-carbon ring. However, hydrogen atoms were added to the active site of the nanoparticle nine times during 1 ps, and one of the hydrogen atoms reacted with an oxygen atom to form a hydroxyl radical. Therefore, hydrogen can continuously attack the surface of the soot particles and add to the active sites. In addition to repeated dehydrogenation and hydrogen abstraction during the graphitization stage, the soot nanoparticle in Case A almost no longer underwent the surface growth reaction, while the addition of branch chains can be seen in the hydrogen doped case. Type 1 showed that the long chain aliphatic hydrocarbon containing 14 carbon atoms was directly added to the active site of the aromatic ring at the edge of the soot nanoparticle, and some small molecules, such as acetylene, were also added to the surface. Combined with the final hydrogen content in Fig. 7 and the analysis in this section, it can be inferred that the addition of hydrogen prolonged the coagulation stage of the PAH precursors and the growth of the initial soot particles. The more hydrogen atoms in the system after the graphitization stage, the more slowly the dehydrogenation reaction occurred on the surface of soot particle and the more pronounced the graphitization process was."
8,Conclusions,"In this study, the transformations from PAHs and aliphatic hydrocarbons to polymers, and finally to initial soot particles in the ethylene flames were simulated using ReaxFF MD under different hydrogen addition conditions. Hemispherical soot nanoparticles with a smooth surface formed within 1 ns in different systems revealing the potential mechanism of the overall evolution. The formation of soot nanoparticles was divided into three stages. During the first stage, the activity of the PAH precursor increased. In the system, small molecules such as aliphatic hydrocarbons and OH radicals, PAHs and PAHs, and PAHs and OH radicals underwent complex reactions to form the initial soot particles. The second stage consisted of the initial nucleation and surface growth process of the soot particles, including the PAH polymers coalescing into clusters, addition of small molecules such as acetylene groups on the surface, and oxidation by OH radicals. The third stage was mainly the graphitization reaction, during which the dehydrogenation of soot particles occurred and the structure transformed to fullerene-like. In addition, the results showed that acetylene addition also led to PAH ring growth and five-membered ring PAHs were found in our simulation. The influence of adding different amounts of hydrogen into the system on the transition process of the PAH precursors to the soot nanoparticles was analyzed. Hydrogen reduced the activity of the species in the system by reacting with OH radicals and aliphatic hydrocarbons, leading to a decreased nucleation rate and number density of soot particles and inhibiting the condensation process of the polymers. By continuously attacking the surface of soot particles and adding to the soot surface active sites, hydrogen atoms reduced the surface reaction and inhibited the dehydrogenation of soot particles, prolonging the structure rearrangement process in the graphitization stage. Hydrogen promoted the decarbonization and dehydrogenation of PAHs and hydrocarbons to form a large amount of methane and other aliphatic hydrocarbons, which was a main factor affecting the size growth of soot particles."
