0,Introduction,"In recent years, the scientific community has identified a link between climate change and increases in gaseous emissions, which result, in part, from the burning of fossil fuels. Forecasts for the year 2030 made by the International Energy Agency (IEA) [1] indicate that fossil fuels will remain the dominant global source of energy and will account for 83% of the overall increase in energy demand between 2004 and 2030. Thus, minimization and control of the environmental impacts of fossil fuel use are critical. Hydrogen is an efficient energy carrier, with 122 kJ g−1 of energy density [2], 2.75 times greater than the energy density of oil. Its most attractive application is in fuel cells, which convert hydrogen into electrical power without generating pollutants. The four basic processes used to produce hydrogen gas from primary sources of non-fossil energy are (i) the electrolysis of water, (ii) thermochemistry processes, (iii) radiolytic processes and (iv) biological processes. The biological production of hydrogen is attractive because organic waste can be used as a feedstock. Wastewaters are raw materials that do not incur production costs. In addition, the sustainability of the biological process used to generate hydrogen from wastewater can be further optimized by combining fermentation with the production of high value-added products, such as organic acids and biopolymers [3]. The fermentation process for generating hydrogen can use various wastewaters and mixed or pure cultures [4,5]. Several studies have reported the use of various effluents and wastewaters that contain cellulose, pentose, xylose [6,7]; glycerol, which is a residue of biodiesel production [8,9]; the by-products of cheese processing [10], dairy processing [11] and wheat flour processing [12]; molasses [13]; solid food wastes [14]; the by-products of paper factories [15]; domestic sewage [8]; the vinasse from bioethanol production [7]; and so on. Small soft-drink industries compose approximately 30% of the Brazilian market, and they generate effluents during production. Due to their high concentration of carbohydrates, wastewaters from the production of soft drinks have the potential to produce biohydrogen because these compounds are the preferred source for hydrogen production during fermentation [3]. This research evaluated the possibility of generating hydrogen from soft-drink wastewater in bench-scale upflow anaerobic packed-bed reactors. The effects of supplementing the wastewater with macro- and micronutrients on hydrogen production were also investigated."
1,Materials and methods,"Two packed-bed reactors, R1 and R2, were operated with semi-synthetic wastewater from soft-drink production. The nutrient-deficient wastewater was supplemented with a solution of macro- and micronutrients in reactor R1."
2,Bioreactor,"2.1 Bioreactor A schematic description of the upflow anaerobic packed-bed reactors is presented in Fig. 1 . The reactors had a diameter of 80 mm, a height of 750 mm, a total volume of 3.8 L and a working volume of 2.370 L. The fixed bed occupied 66% of the total volume and had a height of 500 mm."
3,Semi-synthetic wastewater,"2.2 Semi-synthetic wastewater The composition of the semi-synthetic wastewater was based on the discharge that resulted from washing the tanks used to produce soft drinks. One liter of this semi-synthetic wastewater was composed of tap water (997.831 mL), soft-drink discharges (2.080 mL), detergent belltype® DBC (0.075 mL) and lubricant belltype® E-150 (0.014 mL). Reactor R1 was fed with the semi-synthetic wastewater and the nutritional medium listed in Table 1 . Reactor R2 was operated without nutrient supplementation. The characteristics of the semi-synthetic wastewater were very similar to the characteristics of actual wastewater from soft-drink factories, which are described in Table 2 . To achieve a working pH of 6.5, hydrochloric acid (10 mol L−1) and sodium bicarbonate (0.5 g L−1) were used in both reactors."
4,Support matrices,"2.3 Support matrices The bed zone of the reactor was packed with recycled low-density polyethylene particles to support cell growth. The bed zone of each reactor contained 295 g matrix L−1, which resulted in bed porosities of 55%. Recycled low-density polyethylene was obtained from a garbage bag manufacturer and cut into cylindrical shapes with average diameters of 12.7 mm and heights of approximately 30 mm. This material provided a surface area of 7.94 m2 g−1 with no porosity."
5,Inoculation and biomass attachment on the fixed bed,"2.4 Inoculation and biomass attachment on the fixed bed The inoculum for both reactors was generated during fermentation of the semi-synthetic soft-drink wastewater without nutrient addition inside the influent tank. Natural fermentation of 100 L of semi-synthetic wastewater occurred after five days of exposure to the atmosphere at approximately 25 °C. The fermented semi-synthetic wastewater was pumped into the reactors and recirculated for five days to ensure adequate contact time between the fermented wastewater and the support material for adhesion of the biomass, as described by Leite et al. [17]. After this procedure, the fermented wastewater was discarded, and the influent tank was cleaned before the unfermented semi-synthetic wastewater was added."
6,Operation of the reactors for hydrogen production,"2.5 Operation of the reactors for hydrogen production By adjusting the volumetric flow rate of the feed using a positive displacement pump (Prominent® Concept plus), the reactors were operated with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 0.5 h, based on a working volume of 2.370 L. The reactors were placed in a thermostatic chamber, and the temperature was set at 25 ± 1 °C. The liquid effluent was collected from the side of the reactor, while the gaseous effluent was collected from the top. After exiting the reactor, the biogas entered a gas separator in which CO2 was retained in a solution of NaOH (5 mol L−1) that was changed periodically. One reactor (R1) was fed with the semi-synthetic wastewater supplemented with macro- and micronutrients (Table 1), while the other (R2) was only fed with semi-synthetic wastewater. The initial pH of the semi-synthetic wastewater was maintained at 6.5, a favorable value for hydrogen production [18]. Hydrodynamic assays were performed with a Texas® TI-89 graphing calculator and a CBL data acquisition device coupled with a Vernier® conductivity probe to detect the tracer concentration of 300 mg L−1 in the effluent. NaCl was used for the step stimulus assay [19] and monitored for 3 h. Data from the assays were processed with Microcal Origin 6.1® to evaluate the flow pattern and the actual HRT."
7,Analytical methods,"2.6 Analytical methods The flow rate of the generated hydrogen was recorded with a Milligascounter gas meter (Ritter®). The composition of the biogas (hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane) was determined by gas chromatography (GC 2010 Shimadzu®) [20] with a thermal conductivity detector and argon as the carrier gas. The temperatures of the injector, detector and column were maintained at 30 °C, 200 °C and 230 °C, respectively. Organic acids were analyzed with a Shimadzu® high pressure liquid chromatograph (HPLC) system that was composed of an LC-10ADvp pump, an FCV-10ALvp solenoid valve, a CTO-10Avp oven (working temperature of 45–50 °C), an SCL-10Avp controller, an SPDM10Avp UV detector with a diode array of 205 nm and an Aminex HPX-87H ionic exchange column (0.3-m length and 7.8-mm internal diameter). The moving phase was 0.005-M H2SO4 and had a flow rate of 0.6 mL min−1. The solvent concentrations were measured with a gas chromatograph (GC 2010 Shimadzu®), which was equipped with a flame ionization detector and a sample introduction system with a Combi PAL® headspace (model AOC 5000 and 30-m × 0.25-mm HP-INNOWAX® with a 0.25-μm film thickness). Carbohydrate concentrations were determined by the colorimetric method developed by Dubois et al. [21]. BOD, COD, nitrogen, phosphorous, alkalinity and pH values were determined in accordance with the Standard Methods for Examination of Water and Wastewater [22]."
8,Molecular analyses,"2.7 Molecular analyses Total DNA was extracted using glass beads, phenol and chloroform, as described by Griffiths et al. [23]. The DNA templates were amplified via a polymerase chain reaction by using specific primers for the partial amplification of 16S rRNA genes for bacteria domains (968f and 1392r) and PCR programs described by Nielsen et al. [24]. The primers were synthesized by Invitrogen, and a GC-clamp [25] was added to the forward primers of the three primer pairs. The amplified DNA fragments were separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) [25], with denaturing concentrations of 30% and 70% (urea and formamide). DGGE was conducted with a Dcode® Universal Mutation Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Electrophoresis was conducted at 65 °C for 16 h in 1X TAE buffer with a constant voltage of 75 V. The polyacrylamide gel was stained with ethidium bromide for 20 min and displayed on a UV transilluminator, which was coupled to a computer with Eagle Light UV software to visualize the bands (Stratagene, CA, USA). High-intensity bands were cut from the DGGE gel. The eluted DNA was re-amplified by using primers without the GC-clamp and purified by using the Ultraclean® PCR Clean-up® Kit (Mobio). Using the BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA), the purified DNA was used as the template in the cycle sequencing reaction. Sequencing was performed on an automated ABI PRISM 310 sequencer according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The sequences were verified with the DNA Star program (SeqMan) and subsequently compared to other sequences in the GenBank database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using the basic local alignment search tool (BLASTn). The sequences were aligned with the CLUSTAL X program [26] and analyzed with MEGA software [27]. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed with the neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm with bootstrap values calculated from 500 replicate runs from routines in MEGA 3.1 [28]."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Continuous hydrogen production in fixed bed bioreactors,"3.1 Continuous hydrogen production in fixed bed bioreactors The substrate consumption, soluble metabolites concentration in the liquid effluent, hydrogen generation rate and biogas composition were monitored throughout the course of hydrogen fermentation. The data for reactor R1 and R2 are presented in Figs. 2 and 3 respectively. The hydrogen generation and substrate conversion efficiencies are summarized in Table 3 . In both cases, the biogas consisted of CO2 and H2, whereas CH4 was undetected. Typical soluble metabolites included citric acid (HCi), lactic acid (HLa), formic acid (HFo), acetic acid (HAc), propionic acid (HPr), butyric acid (HBu) and ethanol (EtOH)."
11,Performance of the bioreactor with supplemental nutrients (R1),"3.2 Performance of the bioreactor with supplemental nutrients (R1) During operation, the influent and effluent pH were maintained at approximately 6.5 and 6.0, respectively. The carbohydrate concentrations in the influent and effluent were 1464.94 mg L−1 and 946.36 mg L−1, respectively, with an average carbohydrate degradation rate of 35%. This limited amount of conversion was mainly due to the low HRT. The theoretical HRT was 0.5 h at the beginning of reactor operation. On the 61st day of operation, a hydrodynamic assay showed that the real hydraulic retention time of R1 was 10 min, three times less than the initial HRT. The trend of decreasing substrate utilization, as shown in Fig. 2A, was possibly related to this decrease in the HRT. The accumulation of biomass in the reactor and the subsequent decreases in the working volume decreased the HRT. Chang et al. [29] observed that the substrate utilization efficiency of a bioreactor packed with activated carbon and fed with sucrose decreased by approximately 10% when the HRT was decreased from 3 h to 1 h. Carbohydrate degradation in this reactor could possibly be enhanced by increasing the HRT or minimizing the effects of biomass accumulation, for example, with packed beds with higher porosities. Regarding the low percentage of H2 in the biogas, as shown in Table 3, Chang et al. [29] demonstrated that, when using fixed beds with activated carbon supports to produce H2, a decrease in the HRT or an increase in the substrate loading rate decreased the volumetric hydrogen production rate (VHPR) and H2 content in the biogas. They showed that the VHPR remained nearly constant at 0.62 L h−1 L−1 (H2 content, 24–30%) when the reactor was operated with HRTs of 2 and 3 h, but when HRT was decreased to 1 h, the VHPR and H2 content in the biogas dropped to 0.42 L h−1 L−1 and 12.5%, respectively, in the biogas. According to these authors, the decreased H2 content in the biogas at lower HRTs was mainly caused by excessive CO2 production by bacteria species that do not produce H2. This claim was supported by the results of thermal treatment experiments in which cultures were heated to 75 °C for 1 h. Hydrogen production improved temporarily, but carbon dioxide generation resumed at approximately the same level as before the heat treatment. Because hydrogen-producing bacteria in the sludge were identified as spore-forming Clostridium species, which are resistant to high temperatures, the thermal treatment was expected to isolate the hydrogen-producing bacteria by eliminating other bacterial populations at high temperatures. Thus, the percentage of hydrogen in the biogas could be increased by using thermal treatment processes, which are not be feasible in large-scale reactors. However, a feasible strategy to avoid the drop on hydrogen production could be reducing the organic loading rate by altering the concentration of organic matter in the influent or adjusting the HRT. Fig. 2B shows that, on the 5th day of operation, the maximum hydrogen generation rate was 11.41 mL min−1. After the 8th day of operation, H2 production ceased, directly affecting the biogas composition, as shown in Fig. 2D. The major soluble metabolites produced were butyric acid, acetic acid and propionic acid, with average concentrations of 142.14 mg L−1, 116.34 mg L−1 and 105.09 mg L−1, respectively. According to Antonopoulou et al. [30], the production of propionic acid during the fermentation of carbohydrates for hydrogen production consumes hydrogen in the system, as shown in Reaction 1. Conversely, the production of acetic and butyric acids releases hydrogen into the system, according to Reactions 2 and 3. (1) Propionic acid production: C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 → 2 CH 3 CH 2 COOH + 2 H 2 O (2) Acetic acid production: C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COOH + 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 ↑ (3) Butyric acid production: C 6 H 12 O 6 → CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH + 2 CO 2 + 2 H 2 ↑ The sole carbohydrate source in the semi-synthetic wastewater was sucrose. Thus, when acetic and butyric acids are produced, the theoretical yields are 8 mol H2 mol−1 of substrate and 4 mol H2 mol−1 of substrate, respectively. Reactor R1 produced more butyric acid than reactor R2. Consequently, this system should produce more hydrogen, but this was not observed. A considerable decrease in liquid-gas mass transfer could have occurred. Paus et al. [31] evaluated liquid-gas mass transfer in three reactor configurations, including an upflow sludge bed reactor (UBF), similar to the one used in this study. These researchers showed that, in a UBF with a low HRT and an organic loading rate of 27.0 g COD L−1 d−1, the observed concentration of hydrogen in the liquid phase was 52 times greater than the theoretical concentration, indicating that the reactor was supersaturated with hydrogen. As a result of the hydrodynamics caused by excess biomass growth, liquid-gas mass transfer could have been substantially hindered in reactor R1, as reported by Paus et al. [31]. As shown in Fig. 2B and C, the sharp decrease in the production of hydrogen seems to be related to the increase in the amount of non-reduced compounds. Levin et al. [32] stated that the synthesis of long-chain acids consumes generated hydrogen. This hypothesis is supported by the data shown in Fig. 2C. According to the data from Figs. 2C and 3C, the average production rates of citric acid (24.48 mg L−1), formic acid (52.90 mg L−1) and lactic acid (78.30 mg L−1) were approximately two, three and four times higher, respectively, in reactor R1. In addition, the average ethanol concentration (58.43 mg L−1) was two times higher than that of reactor R2. It is possible that the elevated levels of both ethanol and lactic acid production were caused by the environmental composition of reactor R1. That is, the addition of a medium containing several nutrients could have favored the prevalence of solvent-producing microorganisms such as Klebsiella sp. [33] and Clostridium barkeri [34], a known lactic acid producer. The decrease in the working volume of the reactor caused by excessive biomass growth, which reduced the HRT, may have also caused the high concentrations of lactic acid. The reduced HRT may have led to the accumulation of lactic acid because the reaction time was not sufficient for the conversion of lactate and acetate to butyrate and hydrogen. This hypothesis is supported by the results of Jo et al. [35] and is demonstrated in Reactions 4–6. (4) Lactate + 0.4 Acetate + 0.7 H + → 0.7 Butyrate + 0.6 H 2 + CO 2 + 0.4 H 2 O Δ G o = − 183 . 9 kJ mol − 1 (5) Lactate + Acetate + H + → Butyrate + 0.8 H 2 + 1.4 CO 2 + 0.6 H 2 O Δ G o = − 59.4 kJ mol − 1 (6) 2 Lactate + H + → Butyrate + 2 H 2 + 2 CO 2 Δ G o = − 64.1 kJ mol − 1 From Fig. 2B and C, a relationship can be established between hydrogen generation and metabolite production. Because propionic acid consumes hydrogen from the system, the generation of hydrogen will considerably decrease as propionate production increases. This trend was observed for reactor R1. As soon as propionate generation began to peak at 146.82, 148.35, 211.19 and 175.56 mg L−1, hydrogen production ceased, suggesting that the metabolic pathway associated with the formation of propionate and other products such as citric acid, formic acid, lactic acid and ethanol apparently ended hydrogen production. Table 4 presents a mass balance in terms of COD conducted for reactor R1 to confirm the accuracy of the experimental data. The mass balance shows a considerable amount of missing electron equivalents, ranging from 16.7% to 22.9%. The formation of undetected metabolites or the presence of alternative electron sinks was the main reason for this deficit in the electron mass balance. However, as CH4 and H2S were not detected, the missing electron equivalents were not likely caused by the flow of electrons toward CH4 or H2S, two common terminal electron acceptors involved in anaerobic processes. Rather, some soluble metabolites that were not monitored (e.g., higher-carbon fatty acids or solvents) likely contributed to the calculated range of missing equivalents."
12,Performance of the bioreactor without added nutrients (R2),"3.3 Performance of the bioreactor without added nutrients (R2) The average pH values in the influent and effluent were 6.4 and 6.0, respectively, similar to those observed in reactor R1. According to Fig. 3C, butyric acid, acetic acid and propionic acid were the major soluble metabolites produced, with average concentrations of 120.21 mg L−1, 110.47 mg L−1 and 104.67 mg L−1, respectively. The concentrations of carbohydrates in the influent and effluent were 1469.35 mg L−1 and 1013.80 mg L−1, respectively, with an average carbohydrate degradation rate of 30.4%. This average value of carbohydrate conversion is similar to that observed for R1 but with the opposite trend, as depicted in Figs. 2A and 3A. A hydrodynamic assay performed in reactor R2 on the 70th day of operation showed that the actual HRT was 17.2 min, which was 7.2 min longer than that of reactor R1. The main suggested cause for the shortening of the HRT is biomass accumulation inside the packed bed. This phenomenon was visible in each reactor, but it was impossible to measure as volatile suspended solids (VSS) during operation. To illustrate the hypotheses of different levels of interstitial biomass accumulation inside the reactors, Fig. 4 shows pictures of both reactors on the 53rd day of operation. Lee et al. [36] studied the effect of bed porosity on hydrogen production. They found that higher bed porosities favor hydrogen production because more space is available for cell growth in the liquid phase. The reactors operated by Lee et al. [36] achieved a value of 7.4 L h−1 L−1 with 17.8 g L−1 sucrose, an HRT of 0.5 h and a bed porosity of 90%. This result was explained on the basis of granule formation. As a strategy to avoid washout, the microorganisms in the reactors formed suspended granules of 2–3 mm at an HRT of 0.5 h. According to these authors, suspended cell growth is responsible for more hydrogen production than solid-phase biomass (biofilm). Because reactor R1 had less void space available for suspended cell growth, hydrogen production may have been negatively affected. Reactor R2, which mainly operated under restrictions of nitrogen and accumulated less biomass, may have favored the maintenance of void spaces needed for suspended growth, as shown in Fig. 4. The observed void space decreases, higher CO2 levels in the biogas and higher propionic acid and ethanol concentrations in reactor R1 could be related to the higher COD:N ratio used in this system. Reactor R1 was operated with a COD:N ratio of 100:0.7 because nitrogen in the form of urea was added, whereas reactor R2 did not receive any supplementation, resulting in a COD:N ratio of 100:0.3. Srrethawong et al. [37] evaluated the effect of COD:N ratios of 100:2.2, 100:3.3 and 100:4.4 by using 4-L sequencing batch reactors (ASBR) operated at 37 °C to produce hydrogen from cassava wastewater. The lower COD:N ratio (100:2.2) yielded a gas production rate of 2.3 L h−1, with 40.6% H2 in the biogas, 10,500 mg L−1 of mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) and concentrations of approximately 500 mg L−1, 100 mg L−1, 1100 mg L−1, 200 mg L−1 and 0 mg L−1 of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid and ethanol, respectively. A higher COD:N ratio (100:4.4) yielded a gas production rate of 2.1 L h−1, with 27.2% H2 in the biogas, 12,000 mg L−1 of MLVSS and concentrations of approximately 300 mg L−1, 310 mg L−1, 4500 mg L−1, 2500 mg L−1 and 10,300 mg L−1 of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid and ethanol, respectively. In this research, reactor R1 generated higher concentrations of biomass and soluble metabolites; however, reactor R2, which had a lower COD:N ratio, generated less biomass and fewer metabolites and consequently produced more hydrogen. This trend, which is similar to that noted by Srrethawong et al. [37], indicates that excessive nitrogen addition changed the metabolic pathway of hydrogen production, prompting cell growth rather than gas production and increasing the generation of less-reduced compounds, which can trap hydrogen in long acid chains and solvents and prevent its release as biogas. The effects of nutrient addition, the key factor in this study, on hydrogen production were also observed by Argun et al. [38]. In 2-L serum bottles incubated at 37 °C, the C/N ratio of the medium was varied between 20 and 200, while the C/P ratio was between 50 and 1000. This experiment was conducted to determine the influence of these ratios on the yield and formation rate of hydrogen from the fermentation of wheat powder. The results obtained by Argun et al. [38] demonstrated that, at low C/N ratios (<46), hydrogen yields increased as the C/P ratio decreased; thus, more phosphorous is required at high nitrogen concentrations. At high C/N ratios (>110), the hydrogen yield increased as the C/P ratio increased, demonstrating low phosphorous requirements at low nitrogen concentrations. The N and P requirements were proportionate to one another and to the carbon source as a result of the prevailing stoichiometry of anaerobic metabolism. The highest hydrogen yield, 281 mL H2 g−1 of starch at STP, was obtained with the highest C/N and C/P ratios of 200 and 1000, respectively. This result corresponded to a C:N:P relationship of 100:0.5:0.1, which is similar to the ratio in reactor R2 (100:0.8:0.3) but not to the ratio in reactor R1 (100:1.8:0.4). The C/N and C/P ratios applied to reactor R1 were 57 and 250, respectively, whereas R2 was subjected to ratios of 120 and 316, respectively. It is worth mentioning that sucrose was assumed as the single carbon source in the calculations. The best hydrogen production performance was achieved in reactor R2, which showed higher C/N and C/P ratios, similar to those of the best performing reactor (200 C/N, 1000 C/P) in the study of Argun et al. [38]. These authors concluded that the highest C/N and C/P ratios showed the best hydrogen production performance because low nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations are necessary for low growth yields of anaerobic microorganisms. High nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations could inhibit hydrogen formation by dark fermentation, which likely alters the metabolic pathway. A change in the metabolic pathway can be observed in the metabolite profiles of reactor R1 in Fig. 2C. Fig. 3B shows that the maximum hydrogen generation rate achieved in reactor R2 was 29.44 mL min−1, nearly three times greater than the rate achieved in reactor R1. This was explained by the production patterns of the metabolites. Fig. 3B and C show that hydrogen production effectively began after the 20th day of operation, when the concentration of propionic acid strongly decreased from 166.64 mg L−1 to 65.40 mg L−1. After the 20th day of operation, the butyric and acetic acid concentrations were similar, and the average HAc/HBu ratio was 0.94 until the end of the experiment; however, this ratio was 0.83 for reactor R1. According to Khanal et al. [39], the highest yields of hydrogen from carbohydrates can be achieved with a high HAc/HBu ratio and a pH of approximately 6.5. The average HAc/HBu ratio of reactor R2 was higher than that of reactor R1, indicating that higher HAc/HBu ratios improve hydrogen production performance. Other ratios were studied to better understand the differences in the metabolic pathways observed in reactors R1 and R2. According to the experimental data, reactor R2 exhibited two positive trends for efficient hydrogen production. The gradual increase of the HAc/HPr ratio started around 1.1 and achieved 2.8 by the 61th day of operation, indicating a reduction in propionic acid production as compared to acetic acid production. The HAc/EtOh ratio reached 6.9 by the 14th day of operation and remained around 4.5 until the 61th day, indicating a low level of ethanol production in this bioreactor. The same behavior was not observed in reactor R1. In this reactor, HAc/EtOh and HAc/HPr ratios reached 3.8 by the 7th day of operation and 4.5 by the 14th day, respectively. However, after the 14th day of operation, HAc/EtOh and HAc/HPr ratios presented a sharp decrease resulting in 2.4 and 2.1, respectively, in the end of the operation. The low HAc/HPr and HAc/EtOh ratios observed in reactor R1 indicate that the metabolic pathway supported both propionic acid production, which is unfavorable for hydrogen production, and ethanol production, which does not benefit hydrogen production because it consumes a large amount of the free electrons required to form hydrogen [37]. These facts are in accordance with the higher ethanol production and increased amount of carbon dioxide in the biogas in reactor R1, as shown in Fig. 2C and D. According to Reaction 7 from the study of Srrethawong et al. [37], the substrate can be directly converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide. This partially explains the low hydrogen yield and volumetric hydrogen production rate of reactor R1. (7) C 6 H 12 O 6 → 2 CH 3 CH 2 OH + 2 CO 2 Lay [18] reported that solvent formation is part of the fermentative metabolism of the hydrogen producer Clostridium sp., the most common microorganism associated with hydrogen production in bioreactors, and that this microorganism produces long-chain acids during its exponential growth phase. In addition, this microorganism’s metabolism only shifts to solvent production during its last growth step. Nutrient supplementation (mainly excess nitrogen) may have prompted the use of substrate for direct cell maintenance instead of reproduction; thus, the last growth step was maintained in reactor R1, favoring solvent production. As reported in Table 5 , the mass balance for reactor R2 showed fewer missing electron equivalents than the balance for reactor R1 (Table 4). This indicates that the hypothetical undetected metabolites in reactor R1 were not present in reactor R2. The hypothesis that CH4 and H2S served as terminal electron acceptors in reactor R2 was also discarded because they were not detected in this reactor."
13,Comparative study of anaerobic packed-bed reactors for fermentative hydrogen production,"3.4 Comparative study of anaerobic packed-bed reactors for fermentative hydrogen production Compared to the value of 0.3 L h−1 L−1 obtained by Jo et al. [35], reactor R2 produced a higher hydrogen yield (HY) of 3.5. mol H2 mol−1 substrate and a higher volumetric hydrogen production rate (VHPR) of 0.4 L h−1 L−1. Jo et al. [35] fed a packed-bed reactor with 5.0 g L−1 of glucose and used an HRT of 2 h; polyurethane foam was used as the support material. Further, these researchers used a reinforced clostridial medium (Merck) as a nutrient supplement. This medium was composed of the following materials: 10.0 g L−1 meat extract, 5.0 g L−1 peptone, 3.0 g L−1 yeast extract, 5.0 g L−1 D(+) glucose, 1.0 g L−1 starch, 5.0 g L−1 sodium chloride, 3.0 g L−1 sodium acetate and 0.5 g L−1 L-cysteinium chloride. Chang et al. [29] used activated carbon as a support material in a packed-bed reactor that was operated at an HRT of 1 h and fed with 17.8 g L−1 glucose and recorded a VHPR of 0.42 L h−1 L−1; this is comparable to the data from reactor R2 in the present study. However, Chang et al. [29] supplemented the reactor with the following compounds: 5.24 g L−1 NH4HCO3, 6.72 g L−1 NaHCO3, 0.125 g L−1 K2HPO4, 0.100 g L−1 MgCl2.6H2O, 0.015 g L−1 MnSO4.6H2O, 0.025 g L−1 FeSO4.7H2O, 0.005 g L−1 CuSO4.5H2O and 0.0000125 g L−1 CoCl2.5H2O. Lee et al. [36] recorded 2.9 mol H2 mol−1 substrate and a VHPR of 7.4 L h−1 L−1 using packed-bed reactors with activated carbon as a packing material, an HRT of 0.5 h and 17.8 g L−1 glucose; this is much greater than the VHPR in the present study, and this discrepancy can be explained by the higher applied load of carbon in the form of sucrose. Lee et al. [36] used the same medium as Chang et al. [29] and a different HRT. The HRT that provided the best results for Chang et al. [29] was 1 h, whereas 0.5 h was the best HRT for Lee et al. [36]. Yokoi et al. [40] also obtained a higher VHPR (0.78 L L−1 h−1) than that achieved in the present study, but a higher concentration of carbon (10 g L−1 sucrose) was used, and a medium containing 10 g L−1 Polypepton, 2 g L−1 KH2PO4, 0.5 g L−1 yeast extract and 0.5 g L−1 MgSO4·7H2O was added. Table 6 depicts the results from several authors using packed-bed reactors. The majority of the studies in this table used synthetic substrates with carbohydrates as the carbon source and a specific medium for microorganism growth. These factors certainly contribute to hydrogen production, but they also increase costs. The present study attempted to use raw wastewater to produce hydrogen to increase the sustainability of the fermentative process. Many other types of reactors have been evaluated for hydrogen production from sucrose, but some configurations have been used more frequently. The fluidized bed reactor is commonly used. Lin et al. [44] used an 8-L draft tube fluidized bed reactor (DTFBR) containing immobilized cell particles to continuously produce hydrogen. This reactor was operated at an HRT of 2.2 h and showed 0.26 ± 0.01 L h−1 L−1 and 1.83 ± 0.10 mol H2 mol sucrose−1 at a substrate concentration of 5 g COD L−1. The upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASB) is also common, and it was used by Zhao et al. [45]. Their reactor had a volume of 4 L and was operated with 14.5 g L−1 sucrose at an HRT of 16.4 h. Under these operational conditions, their system achieved 1.62 mol H2 mol hexose−1 and a volumetric hydrogen production rate of 0.123 L L−1 h−1. The most widely used continuous reactor for hydrogen production is the continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). Yuan et al. [46] used a 1-L CSTR, a sucrose concentration of 11.1 g L−1 and an HRT of 2 h to evaluate the effect of calcium supplementation on hydrogen production. They recorded 24.5 ± 0.5 L d−1 L−1 as the VHPR and a hydrogen yield of 3.74 ± 0.32 mol H2 mol sucrose−1. The performance parameter related to the volumetric hydrogen production rate is much higher than that obtained with our reactor; we believe that the elevated substrate concentration in the feed was mainly responsible for this result. Compared to the aforementioned reactors, the packed-bed reactor configuration has certain advantages, including simple construction and increased cell retention time, which is essential for hydrogen production since most part of the high rate reactors are operated at very low HRT [17,29,36,40–42,44]. Further on retaining cells, the packing material can help in the selection microbial populations [47]. In addition to the aforementioned advantages of the packed-bed reactor, the support matrices can be made of recycled material and there is no need for mechanical agitation or a recirculation apparatus in this configuration, resulting in low costs in reactor construction and operation. Even so, some disadvantages must be taken into account, such as the development of unwanted microorganisms attached to the support material and clogging of the packed-bed. The problem related to the accumulation of unwanted microorganisms can be solved by using suitable support material, as reported in the study of Silva et al. [47]. Using low-density polyethylene, the same immobilization matrix utilized in this study, the authors demonstrated that this support material was the best matrix for the attachment of hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria, among polyurethane foam, vegetal carbon and alumina-based ceramics. In fact, hydrogen sulfide or methane were note detected in any experiment, which indicates that these microbial populations were not favored using low-density polyethylene. Clogging of the packed-bed could be solved by structuring the immobilization matrix in order to maintain the desired bed porosity in the reactor. As already mentioned in the paper, Lee et al. [36] demonstrated that in packed-bed reactor it is critical to maintain high bed porosities. It is worth mentioning that, before upscaling the packed-bed reactors into technical scale, studies in bench-scale reactors must be done with different support material and searching for bed arrangements that provide high bed porosities to avoid excessive biomass accumulation and growth of undesirable microorganisms. The characteristics of the substrate are so important as the reactor configuration, and possibly can determine the use of other types of bioreactors. The use of a continuous stirred tank reactor, for example, would be more suitable with lower C/N ratio wastewaters, since in this condition there are more possibilities to occur a change in the metabolic pathway for hydrogen production and promote the development of non-hydrogen producing microorganisms [37]."
14,Molecular analyses,"3.5 Molecular analyses To verify the existence of different communities in each reactor, mixed samples of attached and suspended biomass were collected during the 61st day of operation from both reactors. It is worth mentioning that primers for Archaea and Eucarya domains were not used in this study. Since the inoculum was fermented naturally under atmospheric conditions, without any hygienization or pretreatment before being pumped into the reactors, any kind of anaerobic microrganisms could have germinated. Despite this fact, the aim of the microbiological examination was to search for Clostridium sp., that is the predominant microorganism in hydrogen production processes [48]. The DGGE profile for each reactor showed the predominance of certain bands in the analyzed samples. Bands named 1 and 2 were present in all samples (R1 and R2). In Table 7 , are presented the bands that were excised, re-amplified and sequenced from the DGGE samples with a bacteria domain primer. Bands 1 and 2 are similar to those of Clostridium sp., the expected microorganism to grow in the bioreactors because of the specific operational conditions applied, such pH, low hydraulic retention time and carbon source. Band 3 is similar to that of Klebsiella sp., a genus included in the Enterobacteriaceae family [51] and a nitrogen-fixing microorganism [52]. Lo et al. [53], using pure strains of H2-producing microorganisms, performed batch tests in 200-mL serum vials filled with 17.8 g L−1 sucrose and a nutritional medium to compare the performance of Clostridium pasteurianum CH4 and Klebsiella sp. in the production of hydrogen. C. pasteurianum CH4 produced 600.3 mL H2 at a maximum rate of 76.7 mL h−1 H2, while Klebsiella sp. produced 85.8 mL H2 with a maximum rate of 2.4 mL h−1 H2. EtOH accounted for 5% of the soluble microbial products of C. pasteurianum CH4 and 15% of those for Klebsiella sp. C. pasteurianum CH4 did not form 2,3-Bu(OH)2, while the 2,3-Bu(OH)2 produced by Klebsiella sp. accounted for 57% of the soluble microbial products. For C. pasteurianum CH4, the total volatile fatty acids and soluble microbial products accounted for 9625 and 10,140 mg L−1 COD, respectively. In contrast, Klebsiella sp. produced 1977 mg L−1 COD as total volatile fatty acids and 16,784 mg L−1 COD of soluble microbial products, indicating that its metabolism was more directed to the production of solvents. The low rate of hydrogen production of Klebsiella sp. in the study of Lo et al. [53] is similar to that reported by Wu et al. [54], who obtained 0.92 mol H2 mol−1 sucrose in a batch experiment with an initial sucrose concentration of 30 g L−1 COD at 37 °C. In this study, the major soluble metabolites were 2,3-butanediol and ethanol, accounting for 58% and 29%, respectively, of the total soluble microbial products. The detection of Klebsiella sp. in reactor R1 suggests that the high range of missing electron equivalents (Table 4) could be related to the production of 2,3-butanediol, a metabolite that was not monitored. The higher average ethanol concentration of 58.43 mg L−1 in reactor R1 as compared to the concentration of 30.35 mg L−1 found in reactor R2 also supports the occurrence of this metabolic pathway because 2,3-butanediol and ethanol are limited by oxygen and the pH decreased [55]. If 2,3-butanediol was being produced, the average concentration required to reduce the electron equivalents should have been approximately 215 mg L−1 (42.3% of total soluble metabolites), similar to the results reported by Lo et al. [53] and Wu et al. [54]. The macroscopic yellow tint of the biofilm in reactor R1 may have been caused by the presence of Klebsiella sp. Dworkin et al. [55] reported that Klebsiella strains are surrounded by a thick hydrophilic polysaccharide capsule composed of repeating basic units of four to six sugars responsible for the glistening, mucoid appearance of colonies on agar plates. The addition of urea, nickel sulfate, ferrous ions (Fe2+) and other components, as presented in Table 1, likely influenced the presence of Klebsiella sp. in reactor R1. Several species of Klebsiella hydrolyze urea, and in some, urease plays an important role in nitrogen metabolism. The hydrolization of urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide depends on the presence of a nickel-containing enzyme (urease), and ferrous ions are an essential cofactor for hydrogenases in the production of hydrogen [32]. Band 4 is similar to that of Enterobacter. According to Wang and Wan [56], Enterobacter cloacae can produce 6 mol H2 mol−1 sucrose in batch reactors and is associated with the pathway utilization of NADH, which uses hydrogenase from the reoxidation of NADH produced during glycolysis to generate hydrogen [57]. In spite of the presence of Clostridium sp., the specific dominant strain of Clostridium could not be determined for either reactor. According to Levin et al. [34] C. pasteurianum, Clostridium butyricum and Clostridium beijerinkii are good H2 producers, whereas Clostridium propionicum is a poor H2 producer. Fig. 3C shows that, from the 20th day of operation, reactor R2 was directed toward a HBu-HAc metabolic pathway. According to Lin et al. [58], this metabolic pathway suggests the presence of Clostridium acetobutylicum, Clostridium tyrobutyricum and Clostridium beijerinckii. The constant propionate production observed in reactor R1 suggestsed that C. propionicum could be the favored strain in this system; however, the 16S rRNA analysis showed 91% similarity to the Clostridium sp. As previously determined, all identified microorganisms were involved in hydrogen production; in addition, according to the DGGE profile, Bands 1 and 2 (Clostridium sp.) were favored for both reactors. However, Bands 3 (Klebsiella sp.) and 4 (Enterobacter sp.) were favored in reactors R1 and R2, respectively. The use of the same carbon source and similar environmental conditions likely resulted in the development of similar communities."
15,Conclusions,"This study demonstrated the feasibility of continuous hydrogen production in upflow anaerobic packed-bed reactors using soft-drink wastewater as the feedstock, yielding 3.5 mol H2 mol−1 substrate. Lower hydrogen yields and volumetric hydrogen production rates were recorded for the reactor fed with a supplementary nutritional medium (R1 – C:N:P = 100:1.8:0.4) as compared to the reactor only fed with semi-synthetic wastewater (R2 – C:N:P = 100:0.8:0.3). The addition of nutrients to reactor R1 likely caused the observed change in the metabolic pathway for hydrogen production, produced excessive biomass growth and consequently decreased the void space. Excessive biomass growth was mainly caused by a low C/N ratio. The finding that soft-drink wastewater without added nutrients can enhance hydrogen generation indicates that the costs of hydrogen production can be significantly decreased; a simple inoculation procedure by natural fermentation makes biohydrogen fermentation feasible at a large scale. The molecular analysis demonstrated that all excised bands, re-amplified and sequenced from the DGGE samples obtained with a bacteria domain primer, represented microorganisms known to produce hydrogen. We also observed that the predominant strains, as determined by molecular analysis, were the same in reactors R1 and R2. Although improvements to the packed bed are necessary to avoid excessive biomass accumulation (e.g., controlling bed porosity by using structured array of the support matrices), this reactor configuration employed in the hydrogen production from soft-drink wastewater is a step toward sustainable biohydrogen production because it does not require a recirculation apparatus, the support matrices can be made of recycled low-density polyethylene and heat system is not necessary unless it is operated in regions with average temperatures below 25°C. The effluent, which was rich in organic acids, alcohols and carbohydrates, could be used in methanization in a second reactor, increasing the sustainability of the process by recovering CH4 and more efficiently removing organic matter."
