0,Introduction,"Photocatalytic hydrogen production through semiconductors and solar energy irradiation is regarded as a promising technique to solve the energy crisis in future [1]. However, the current studies have not found an ideal semiconductor photocatalysts system with high efficiency because it is a complex reaction which refers many kinetic and thermodynamic process. The semiconductors as photocatalysts must satisfy some rigorous rules such as suitable band gaps, negative conduction band and so on [2]. During the past few decades, various photocatalysts including metal oxides, sulfides, oxynitrides and perovskites have been developed. [3–6] In order to enhance the photocatalytic activities, some strategies, for example constructing junctions, elemental doping and surface modifications, are tried and many of them exhibit promoted photocatalytic hydrogen production performance [7,8]. However, the design and synthesis of new materials for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production is still the flash point of scientific research. Manganese oxides, mainly including MnO2, Mn2O3 and Mn3O4, have been widely studied for many years owing to their outstanding properties in catalytic, electrochemical, magnetic, optical, and electrocatalytic biosensors and their non-toxicity, abundance and cost effective feature [9,10]. Manganese is also the main ions of photosynthesis in green plants which could catalyze oxygen production. Some works have been shown that manganese oxides cluster displays excellent oxygen production ability in photocatalysis [11,12]. However, the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of manganese oxides have been seldom investigated. Surface area and morphology of photocatalysts could deeply affect their activities [13]. Hierarchical structure materials possess large surface area and the special structures that favors charge transport and promote the photocatalytic activity. To control the surface morphology of semiconductors is a great challenge. Solvothermal method is an effective approach to prepare hierarchical structure materials, and different oxides such as TiO2, ZnO, titanates etc could be synthesized by solvothermal method [14–16]. To study the photocatalytic activity of manganese oxides, hierarchical Mn2O3 microsphere assembled with nanosheets have been controllably prepared through solvothermal method. The obtained hierarchical Mn2O3 microspheres show enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production performance as compared to Mn2O3 particles. The promoted photocatalytic activity could be attributed to the hierarchical structure which favors charge transfer."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemicals and reagents,2.1 Chemicals and reagents All the reagents were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification. Deionized water was used throughout the experiment.
3,Synthesis of hierarchical Mn2O3 microspheres,"2.2 Synthesis of hierarchical Mn2O3 microspheres 2.45g manganous acetate and 0.3g sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were dissolved in 40mL ethylene glycol (EG) to form a clear pink solution, then the solution was stirring for 1h to make the SDS completely dissolved. After that, the pink solution was transferred into 50mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, which was then sealed and heated at 160°C for 12h. After solvothermal process, the obtained dark pink precipitate was centrifuged and washed three times with absolute alcohol, and dried in vacuum at 60°C for 4h. The hierarchical Mn2O3 microspheres were obtained by annealing the precipitate at 500°C for 2h. The Mn2O3 particles were prepared by annealing commercial MnO2 particles at 500°C for 2h."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by Bruker D8. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs were taken using a Hitachi S-4800 instrument operating at 15KV. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiment was performed on a JEM-2100 electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) with an acceleration voltage of 200kV. Carbon-coated copper grids were used as the sample holders. The specific surface area was determined according to the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method using a Tristar II 3020 surface area and porosity analyzer (micromeritics). UV–vis absorption spectroscopy was recorded using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU UV-2550). The X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was tested using a Kratos-AXIS ULTRA DLD apparatus with Al(Mono) X-ray source, and the binding energies were calibrated with respect to the signal for adventitious carbon (binding energy=284.6eV)."
5,Evaluation of photocatalytic activity,"2.4 Evaluation of photocatalytic activity The photocatalytic H2 production experiment was conducted in an online photocatalytic H2 production system (AuLight, Beijing, CEL-SPH2N) at ambient temperature (20°C). In a typical experiment, 0.1g of photocatalyst was suspended in a mixture of 80mL distilled water and 20mL methanol in the reaction cell by using a magnetic stirrer. 1wt.% Pt loaded photocatalysts were prepared by known standard method of in-situ photodeposition method using H2PtCl6 aqueous solution. Prior to the reaction, the mixture was deaerated by evacuation to remove O2 and CO2 dissolved in water. The reaction was carried out by irradiating the mixture with visible light from a 300W Xe lamp (AuLight, CEL-HXF300) with a UVCUT filter (AuLight, 400–780nm). Gas evolution was observed only under photoirradiation, being analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (SP7800, TCD, molecular sieve 5Å,N2 carrier, Beijing Keruida Limited)."
6,Results and discussion,"X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique is regarded to be the most effective method to reveal the crystal structure of materials. Fig. 1 is the XRD patterns of prepared Mn2O3 precursor and products calcined at different temperature. It could be learned from the XRD of Mn2O3 precursor that the peak in low angle around 10° is the typical peak of metal glycolate which had been reported everywhere [5,14]. When the precursor calcined at low temperature of 300°C, the product is amorphous because this temperature is lower than the minimum crystallization temperature of manganese oxides. After annealing at 500°C, pure phase Mn2O3 is obtained. All of the XRD reflection peaks can be readily indexed to a bixbyite orthorhombic phase of Mn2O3with the calculated lattice constant a=0.941nm, b=0.942nm, and c=0.940nm, respectively, which are in good agreement with the literature results (JCPS No 41-1442) [17]. It could be learn from XRD, that the precursor possesses metal glycolate structure. To further study the organic groups in the precursor, FT-IR spectrum of the as-prepared Mn2O3 precursor is measured as shown in Fig. 2 . The absorption peaks in the range of 2849∼2924cm−1 correspond to υas and υs (CH) bands, at ∼1572cm−1 correspond to CO bands, and in the range of 1050 ∼1125cm−1 is attributed to ρ(CH2), υ(CO), and υ(CC) bands [18]. These organic groups reveal that the precursor is metal-EG organic complex. It is well known that EG is a bidentate ligand and can react with metal ions to form the metal-glycolate polymer with chain like structure for its coordination ability with transition metal ions [19]. This means the precursor contains organic frameworks which could be removed and leaving holes when calcined. The morphology of the precursor and hierarchical Mn2O3 microspheres is studied by SEM. The SEM images in Fig. 3 show that the precursor is flower-like microsphere (Fig. 3A and B) with the diameter approximately 8–10μm. The microspheres is composed by thin curly nanosheets to form hierarchical structure with many aggregated holes. When they are calcined at 500°C for 2h, the hierarchical flower-like microsphere structure (Fig. 3C and D) remained without obviously changes but the thin sheets become thick and leave some pores. The high resolution SEM images in Fig. 3 E and F clearly show that there are many holes on the nanosheets. These holes are produced as a result of removing the organic frameworks by annealing. It is sure that the resultant holes are beneficial to increase the surface area of product. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of hierarchical Mn2O3 microspheres after calcination are shown in Fig. 4 . The BET surface area is about 25m2/g. It is about three times higher than that of Mn2O3 particles (8.86m2/g) which is applied for comparison. The high surface area is suggested to have positive affect on the activities. TEM and HRTEM images of the hierarchical Mn2O3 microspheres are shown in Fig. 5 . It could be learn from the thin edge of the microsphere as shown in Fig. 5B, that the microsphere is composed of thin nanosheets with porous morphology and consistent with SEM and BET results. HRTEM image in Fig. 5C shows that the lattice fringes at d-spacing (d222 =0.27nm) correspond to the (222) crystallographic planes of bixbyite orthorhombic phase of Mn2O3. The clear well-defined lattice fringes reveal that the material is highly crystalline. As it is seen from the SEM images of hierarchical Mn2O3 microspheres precursor that the microsphere is assembled with nanosheets. It is interesting to make the growing process of the hierarchical microspheres clear. The SEM images of the collected samples at different hydrothermal time intervals in Fig. 6 show the growing process of the hierarchical microspheres. Nanosheets are formed at the beginning of solvothermal reaction, then the nanosheets begin to assemble together to form aggregates owing to the hydrogen bond and Van der Waals' forces. Finally, the aggregates keep growing to hierarchical sphere-like structure because sphere-like of the aggregates is the optimal geometrical structure which have the lowest surface energy. It is common knowledge that light absorption by the material as well as migration of the light-induced electrons and holes are the key factors to control a photocatalytic reaction, which is relevant to the electronic structure characteristics of the material [20]. Fig. 7 illustrates the light absorption properties of hierarchical Mn2O3 microspheres and Mn2O3 particles (for comparison). For a crystalline semiconductor, the optical absorption near the band edge follows the equation αhv =A(hν-Eg)n/2, where a, ν, Eg and A are the absorption coefficient, the light frequency, the bandgap and a constant, respectively [21]. Among them, n decides the characteristics of the transition in a semiconductor that n=1/2 is applied in this work according to the literature [22]. The bandgap of the hierarchical Mn2O3 microspheres is calculated to be about 3.2eV from the onset of the absorption edge. The band structure of hierarchical Mn2O3 microspheres is much important to its photocatalytic activity. However, seldom works report the conduction and valence band of Mn2O3. To make this clear, XPS valence band spectra is measured to confirm the valence band of Mn2O3. Difference correlation method is applied to calculate the conduction band of Mn2O3. The clearly reported band diagram of MnO2 is chosen for comparison [23]. XPS valence band spectra in Fig. 7B show that the valence band of hierarchical Mn2O3 microspheres and Mn2O3 particles are the same, however, it is 0.62eV positive to MnO2. It means that the morphology of Mn2O3 does not change the band structure and its valence band is 0.62eV positive than MnO2. According to the band gap of Mn2O3 and MnO2, the structures of Mn2O3 and MnO2 are shown in Fig. 7C. It is obvious that the conduction band of Mn2O3 lies at about −1eV, which is more negative than the potential of H+/H2. The negative conduction band makes the thermodynamic reduction of H+ much easier. Theoretically, the prepared hierarchical Mn2O3 microspheres is a great candidate for photocatalytic hydrogen production, owing to its suitable band structure and large surface area. The time course H2 production efficiency of hierarchical Mn2O3 microspheres and Mn2O3 particles is shown in Fig. 8 A. The SEM image of Mn2O3 particles is shown in Fig. 9 which indicate that the morphology of the particles are irregular with an average diameter of about 300–500nm. The H2 production efficiency of hierarchical Mn2O3 microspheres and Mn2O3 particles is 74.24 and 25.36μmolgh−1, respectively. It is almost three times higher than that of Mn2O3 particles. It could be also learn that both the hierarchical Mn2O3 microspheres and Mn2O3 particles are very stable that can produce H2 continually for 5 times recycling experiment in 20h, as shown in Fig. 8B. The enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production activity could be attributed to the following factors: (i) the hierarchical microsphere structure that favors charge transport to accelerate the charge separation; (ii) the large surface area caused by the wrap and overlap nanosheets as well as the obtained porous structure by removing the organic frameworks; (iii) the suitable band structure with very negative conduction band that possesses great photo-reduction ability."
7,Conclusions,"In summary, hierarchical Mn2O3 microspheres assembled with porous nanosheets have been prepared by solvothermal method. The self assemble process of the microsphere are studied. The band structure of Mn2O3 microspheres calculated from UV–vis and XPS valence spectra reveals that the conduction band is more negative and potentially much suitable for photocatalytic hydrogen production. The H2 production activity of hierarchical Mn2O3 microspheres and Mn2O3 particles is 74.24 and 25.36μmolg−1 h−1, respectively. The promoted photocatalytic hydrogen production activity may come from the interesting hierarchical structure and suitable band gap of Mn2O3 microspheres. This Mn2O3 microspheres photocatalyst give a new choice to prepare high efficiency photocatalysts for solar hydrogen production."
