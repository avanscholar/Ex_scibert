0,Introduction,"Benzaldehyde is one of the most industrially useful member of the family of aromatic aldehydes [1]. It has been used in perfumery, food and plastic industry, as a solvent or for the manufacture of dyes, pesticides, medicinal, and can also be an industrial intermediate for the production of benzoic acid and many other organic compounds. According to the last report on the global benzaldehyde market published in 2019, the benzaldehyde sales will reach about 117 MT in 2023, with an annual growth of 3.18% [2]. It has significantimportance whether in industry or in a laboratory-scale. Currently, two methods are industrially important to produce benzaldehyde, the hydrolysis of benzal chloride which is the oldest process, and the air oxidation of toluene, the source of the majority of the world’s synthetic benzaldehyde [1]. The first process requires the use of activated carbon as a catalyst, treated with sulfuric acid (>95%) or impregnated with metal chloride (ferric chloride) and/or a metal sulfate such as cupric sulfate. Water and benzal chloride were pumped into a vaporizer (200–340 °C), the reaction mixture passed through the catalyst column maintained at a constant temperature to accomplish hydrolysis. A maximum yield of 97% benzaldehyde can be obtained [3]. The aggressive operating conditions and the liquid pollution generated during the washing of the catalyst decreases the efficiency of this process. When toluene oxidation requires extreme operating conditions, high pressure and temperature produces low yield because of by-products formation and finally generates a large amount of carbon dioxide, which contribute to global warming [4]. Selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol is an alternative method to produce benzaldehyde, and it occurs traditionally by using inorganic oxidants employed, generally, in stoichiometric amounts, such as chromium salts [5,6], manganese [7], bromine [8] or the use of chlorinated oxidants often in organic media. These oxidations suffer from poor selectivity and produce environmentally hazardous or toxic by-products [9]. To overcome the disadvantages of stoichiometric oxidation processes, the use of green oxidants, such as molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide with recyclable solid catalysts is considered as a new ecologically benign synthetic route. Indeed, several heterogeneous catalysts have been developed for oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, such us, WO3/g-C3N4 [10], Fe3O4 [11], MnO0.5/(Ba0.05Ce0.95)0.5 [12], Co@SiO2@[Ni(II)SBC] and of Co@SiO2@[Zn(II)SBC] [13], Co2MgxAl-LDHs [14], Ni3[Fe(CN)6]2 [15], H2WO4/(NH4)2MoO4 [16], ZP and ZPZn [17]. Recently, supported noble metal catalysts attracted a growing interest because they were exceptionally active for oxidation of benzyl alcohol, while achieving high selectivity to benzaldehyde. Here are some examples: Au-Pd/C [18], Au@Pd/TiO2 [19], Au-Pd/TiO2 [20], Au/CuO [21], Au/SBA-15[22], Au/UiO-66 [23], Au/Al2O3 [24], Au/HMS [25], Au/Mn-CeO2 [26], Ag/SBA‐15[27], Pd-Zn/TiO2 [28], Pd/Zirconia [29], Pd/SiO2 [30], Ag/SiO2 [31], Pd/CeO2-NG [32], Pt/ZnO [33], Cu-Ni nanoparticle-supported catalysts [34], CuSO4 [35], CuBr2 [36] and ZPCu [37]. Unfortunately, the high cost of noble metals limits their industrial applications. In this work, we report a cheap and mild procedure for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol by Zr-Ni/Natural Phosphate. The catalyst was characterized using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The effect of operational conditions on the catalytic performance has been investigated as well as the reuse capacity of the developed catalyst."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation and characterization of Zr-Ni/Natural phosphate catalyst,"2.1 Preparation and characterization of Zr-Ni/Natural phosphate catalyst Natural phosphate was collected from ore resources in Khouribga (Morocco). This raw material has undergone a series of treatments in order to obtain a phosphate concentrate and to eliminate gangue minerals, organic matter, and other impurities. We followed the previously published protocol [38]. The raw NP is carried out by quartering, followed by washing and granulometric separation. The fraction of particle size 100–400 μm was isolated, calcined at 900 °C for 2 h and washed with water, recalcined again at 900 °C for 30 min and finally crushed and sieved to have a fraction < 63 μm. The bimetallic Zr-Ni material was synthesized by an impregnation method where aqueous solutions of 15% of nickel and zirconium were added into the natural phosphate (85%) in 20 mL water. The mixture was kept under vigorous magnetic stirring for 6 h. After evaporation of the water under reduced pressure, the solid is dried at 120 °C overnight. The final solid was calcined at 400 °C for 3 h. The prepared catalyst was labeled as Zr-Ni/NP."
3,General reaction procedure of oxidation of benzyl alcohol,"2.2 General reaction procedure of oxidation of benzyl alcohol In a typical experiment, a mixture of benzyl alcohol (1 mmol), H2O2 (1 mmol) and a specific amount of catalyst was placed in a sealed round bottom flask with vigorous magnetic stirring and without organic solvents for a specific temperature and time. The reaction temperature was maintained constant by immersing the round bottom flask in a constant temperature oil bath. The reaction was monitored by thin layer chromatography (silica gel, hexane: EtOAc). After the completion of the reaction, the catalyst was removed by filtration, and the obtained product was extracted from the aqueous medium with ethyl acetate. Then, ethyl acetate was removed from the product by evaporation. The pure product was obtained by column chromatography over silica gel using hexane/ethyl acetate as eluent."
4,Catalytic performance test and reusability of catalyst,"2.3 Catalytic performance test and reusability of catalyst The effect of reaction parameters such as the nature of the solvent, the amount of catalyst, the reaction time, and the temperature was studied. To examine the reusability of Zr-Ni/NP, the used catalyst was recovered from the reaction mixture by filtration, washed thoroughly with distilled water and dried at 120 °C. Then it was reused as a catalyst in the catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol under the optimized conditions."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The result of X-ray diffraction scanning on Zr-Ni/NP in Fig. 1 shows that no major differences are observed in the XRD pattern in comparison with the XRD peaks of NP indicating that the apatite crystal lattice has not been affected by the presence of 15% of nickel and zirconium. The main peaks of the apatite structure appear at 2θ = 31.8°; 33.0° and 34.0° corresponding to the standard fluorapatite sheet (A.S.T.M sheet number 01–087-2462) [39]. We can also raise, in Zr-Ni/NP pattern, the apparition of a new crystalline phases, including NiO and Zr1.5Cl2 at 2θ = 43.16° and 37.14° respectively. Nearly similar results were obtained by the impregnation of hydroxyapatite by nickel nitrate [40]. In the IR absorption spectra of Ni-Zr/NP and NP, the typical bands for apatite of PO4 3- are represented in Fig. 2 which confirms the apatitic structure of the two catalysts. The absorption band positions and their assignments are summarized in Table 1 according to the literature data."
7,Catalytic activity for benzyl alcohol oxidation,"3.2 Catalytic activity for benzyl alcohol oxidation 3.2.1 Catalyst synergetic effect Fig. 3 compares the catalytic activity of different catalysts under the same reaction conditions. The results show that benzyl alcohol oxidation requires the use of a catalyst to get the reaction to go, contrariwise, the highest activity was observed for Zr-Ni/NP catalyst. Zirconium and nickel individually had almost similar catalytic behavior but the combination of them enhanced the activity of natural phosphate. This fact confirms the synergistic effect in the catalytic properties between Zr and Ni for benzyl alcohol oxidation. This result is in agreement with the literature which states that heterogeneous catalysts comprising supported bimetallic particles are exceptionally active for many reactions compared to their monometallic analogs. Actually, supported gold–palladium catalysts have been found to be effective for oxidation of Alcohols (Au-Pd/C [18], Au Pd/Ce0.62Zr0.38O2 [50], Au-Pd/TiO2 [51]). 3.2.2 Effect of solvent variation Water has emerged as a versatile solvent for organic chemistry especially the oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol [52], we tested it with other solvents such as toluene, acetonitrile and without solvent. The obtained results in Fig. 4 show that the best result has been achieved using a solvent-free system. Similar results were obtained in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol using titania-supported gold–palladium catalyst [53,54] and Mg-Al layered-double hydroxide (LDH) [55]. 3.2.3 Effect of catalyst amount The catalyst amount optimization studies were carried out by varying catalyst quantities ranging from 0.05 to 0.2 g. The other parameters such as reaction time (1 h), temperature (80 °C), initial dose of H2O2 (1 mmol) was maintained constant. The results are shown in Fig. 5 . By increasing the catalyst mass between 0.05 and 0.08 g, there was an increase in the reaction yield which has reached its maximum value of 93%. The reason behind that could be due to the speed up the decomposition of H2O2 over the large surface area available with a higher mass catalyst, which influenced the quantity of oxidant obtainable throughout the reaction [56] and [57]. 3.2.4 Effect of temperature Fig. 6 shows the effect of temperature on the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. The yield increased from 0% to 93% with an increase in temperature from 25 °C to 70 °C while it remained unaffected when increasing the temperature from 70 to 80 °C. At higher to 80 °C, the yield started decreasing. A plausible reason for the decrease in catalytic activity at temperatures above 80 °C was the thermal decomposition of H2O2 which is greatly enhanced at elevated temperatures [58]. Therefore, the optimal temperature is 70 °C. 3.2.5 Effect of reaction time Reaction time has a significant impact on the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. The results of the effect of reaction are presented in Fig. 7 and indicates that there is an almost linear increase in the reaction yield by increasing the time from 15 to 45 min, after that, the reaction yield is almost stabilized. This is due to the time required for the formation of reactive intermediate as a result of the interaction between the alcohol and the catalyst and then the conversion to the final product [59]. Therefore, 45 min was selected as the optimal reaction time."
8,Catalyst reutilization,"3.3 Catalyst reutilization Designing a catalytic process which lend themselves to recover and reuse the catalyst is a very important aspect from both an economic and an environmental viewpoint [60]. The reusability of the Zr-Ni/NP catalyst was investigated under the optimum reaction conditions for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol, and the results are shown in Fig. 8 . During the first two reuses, the catalyst still maintains its catalytic performance, but from the third reuse, the catalyst begins to lose up until it reaches 64% yield in the 5th reuse. This is probably due to the deactivation of the active sites of the catalyst surface, which is common in heterogeneous catalysis. After several reuse, the spent catalyst cannot be released in a natural environment because of the presence of metallic elements, in particular nickel, and for both environmental and economical issues, nickel and zirconium shall be recovered and reused for the production of new catalyst, this will reduce the possible negative impact on the environment, and also may substantially reduce the cost of the process, which is very advantageous for future industrial application. With regard to the reaction mechanism of such complex and versatile material like natural phosphate, whose knowledge of the operating action is still poorly understood today, further studies are currently underway. Nevertheless, and based on the results found in this study as well as on the behavior of similar catalysts in the literature, we can draw a preliminary mechanism of the oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol on Zr-Ni/NP. It is important to emphasize that the reaction did not start without catalyst (Fig. 3), this proves that hydrogen peroxide needs an activating agent to initiate the oxidation reaction [61]. We can also observe from the results, that incorporation of nickel and zirconium ions on natural phosphate surface’s, whether alone or together, increased significantly the catalytic activity of Zr-Ni/NP. It could be concluded that metallic ions in surface play an important role in the BzOH oxidation, which has been confirmed by the literature [62]. Furthermore, the apatitic structure of Zr-Ni/NP confirmed by IR spectrum, supposes the existence on the catalyst surface, sites of high electron density representing the basic character according to Lewis (Oxygen), and electron-poor sites contributing to the acid character of phosphates (Phosphorus and calcium). Based on all these informations, and according to literature [37,63-65], preliminary mechanistic studies for such reaction indicated that the mechanism might be based on the following steps (Scheme 1 ), the metal lewis acid site on the surface of the catalyst interacts with H2O2 to form (A) and it reacts with benzyl alcohol to give an intermediate (B) which gives benzaldehyde compound and regenerated active sites by two steps of dehydration."
9,Catalytic performance of Zr-Ni/NP,"3.4 Catalytic performance of Zr-Ni/NP The performance of the Zr-Ni/NP catalyst is measured in terms of the benzaldehyde productivity in benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde oxidation. As can be seen from Table 2 , the productivity scatter between 0.59 and 180 mmol of benzaldehyde/g/h and the phosphate-based catalysts whether natural or synthetic, showed outstanding catalytic performance. Zr-Ni/NP showed the highest yield for benzaldehyde under mild condition, and α‐Zirconium phosphate whether in combination with nickel or copper, showed the highest productivity. Among all the catalysts, Zr-Ni/NP exhibits a rather good performance in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol."
10,Conclusion,"In summary, a mild oxidation system has been developed to convert benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde using natural phosphate supported Zr Ni bimetallic particles. The results of preliminary experiments showed that the synthesized Zr-Ni/NP can be effectively used as a heterogeneous catalyst for the solvent-free oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde with H2O2 as a green oxidant. Under the optimized conditions, the yield of benzaldehyde reached 93%. It was demonstrated that Zr-Ni/NP could be easily separated from the reaction mixture and reused at least for three runs, even though with some loss of catalytic activity. More importantly, the synthesized catalyst presented a good catalytic performance in comparison with others one reported recently in the literature. Future work on this reaction would have to study the effect of catalyst loading on the catalytic performance and to study the mechanism of the oxidation reaction before considering an industrial application."
