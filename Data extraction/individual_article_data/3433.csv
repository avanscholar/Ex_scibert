0,Introduction,"The increasing energy demands and rapid combustion of fossil fuels are one of the most important reasons for environmental pollution and climate changes. However, over the last decades, efforts have been focused on searching for new alternative energy sources including biomass and waste, which are used to produce bioethanol, biomethane or hydrogen. In particular, hydrogen is of great interest due to its high energy yield (122 kJ/g) and cleanness since its combustion produces only water vapor without CO or CO2 emission. However, at present hydrogen is almost exclusively produced by traditional methods from fossil fuels (natural gases, oil, coal) mostly via steam reforming, which is energy consuming and contributes to greenhouse gas emission [1–3]. In contrast, biological methods of hydrogen production, although less efficient, are environmentally friendly and utilize variety of waste and biomass of plant origin. Among various biological methods of hydrogen generation, photo- and dark fermentations pay special attention. The first process utilizes simple organic substrates like volatile fatty acids or monosaccharides and is conducted by photosynthetic microorganisms needing the access to the light as a source of energy [4,5]. Whereas hydrogen production through dark fermentation (DF) allows to decompose macromolecular organic compounds into volatile organic acids, alcohols, simple sugars and hydrogen, and is favorable over photofermentation due to higher operating rates and no light requirements. In dark fermentation, hydrogen is generated as a product of both acidogenesis and acetogenesis in which anaerobic bacteria are involved, including Enterobacter spp., Clostridium spp., Bacillus spp., Ruminococcus spp. or Thermoanaerobacterium spp. [6]. Generally, substrates of plant origin are used in this process for example waste from agri-food industry, waste from sugar industry or food waste. The main component of these substrates is lignocellulose, which is hardly degradable in its original form. Lignocellulose in the plant waste represents a complex of polymers that interact together forming a recalcitrant matrix in which cellulose and hemicellulose are tightly bound to lignin. Simple sugars (pentoses and hexoses) within a lignocellulose structure are not easily useable since the lignin coating is highly resistant to environmental factors like temperature [7,8]. Hence, an appropriate pretreatment is required to efficiently produce biofuels from plant biomass. There are three main groups of pretreatment methods applied for lignocellulose materials: physical, chemical, biological and a combination of them [8–10]. An ideal substrate for sustainable production of biohydrogen should meet specific criteria: should be rich in carbohydrate, be produced from sustainable resources, be of easily accessible, require a minimum pretreatment and must be performed at low cost. The substrates, which meet the above conditions, include sugar beet pulp (SBP), corn silage (CS) and fruit and vegetable waste (FVW). Fruit and vegetable waste seems to be an ideal feedstock for dark fermentative hydrogen production because it contains a high polysaccharide fraction, it is cheap and easily available throughout the year. Unfortunately, a considerable fraction of this waste still is disposed by landfilling thus increasing uncontrolled methane and carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. Sugar beet pulp is a by-product obtained in large quantities during beet processing in sugar factories. According to the data of Central Statistical Office in Poland, a total of 3.7 million tons of sugar beet pulp was produced in Poland between September 2017 and January 2018. A part of this material is used as forage for ruminant animals, but there is still a problem with management or utilization of the remaining SBP. Corn silage is a high-quality forage crop for cattle breeding due to its great digestibility and potential for biogas and hydrogen production. A common problem with corn silage are molds, which are toxic to livestock and damage silage quality. They appear especially when silage is exposed to air. Fusarium along with Aspergillus, Gibberella and Penicillium are common molds that cause problems [11]. Although the hydrogen production from fruit and vegetable waste has been described in many papers, the literature dealing with dark fermentation of CS and especially SBP is scarce. Moreover, most investigations were performed in bench scale using simple batch tests, the results of which do not reflect the real processes that occur in full-scale installations. Therefore, this study investigates dark fermentation of SBP, FVW and CS in a semi-continuous installation under various operating conditions. In addition to assessing the process for hydrogen yield, the authors have focused on the behavior of volatile fatty acids and sugars during fermentation as these aspects have not been widely described in the literature. Furthermore, a detailed microbial analysis of the digestates and its link to the hydrogen production in each fermentation process has also been performed. And last but not the least, the experiments showed new findings towards the growth of methanogens during dark fermentation."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Inoculum and pretreatment,"2.1 Inoculum and pretreatment Anaerobic sludge collected from an anaerobic mesophilic digester at the Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant in Lodz, Poland and served as inoculum for the experiments. The analysis revealed had total and volatile solids concentrations of 25.87 g TS/kg and 16.52 g VS/kg, respectively (Table 1 ). The characteristics of inoculum used in this study are shown in Table 1. Inoculum contains microflora that produce H2 via dark fermentation but also archeons, which produce CH4. To avoid the activity of methanogens, the inoculum was thermally treated at 80 °C for 1.5 h before being placed in the reactors. Moreover, during the experiments, pH in the reactors was maintained at approximately 5.5 by with the use of 20% NaOH solution."
3,Substrate characteristics,"2.2 Substrate characteristics The experiments were conducted using hydrolyzed sugar beet pulp (SBP), corn silage (CS) and fruit and vegetable wastes (FVW). Sugar beet pulp was collected in Dobrzelin Sugar Factory, corn silage was obtained from a local farm in Belchatow, whereas fruit and vegetable waste was collected in individual households of the authors. After collection, corn silage and fruit and vegetable wastes were ground in a grinder (FIMAR TS-32D400V, Italy) to particles of diameter approx. 3–13 mm. Each substrate after mechanical pretreatment was mixed to obtain homogenous pulp. The substrates were stored at −30 °C prior to use. Before the experiments, the feedstocks were defrosted, diluted with water and stored at 4 °C. Sugar beet pulp used for the tests were subjected to hydrolysis beforehand by using a mixture of two commercial multienzyme preparations: Viscozyme® and Ultraflo® Max (Novozymes, Bagsvӕrd, Denmark). These enzymes exhibite cellulolytic (Viscozyme – 13.8 U/ml; Ultraflo Max – 27.6 U/ml), xylanolytic (24.9 U/ml and 127.1 U/ml, respectively) and pectinolytic (411.8 U/ml and 24.0 U/ml, respectively) activity. The saccharification (enzymatic degradation of cellulose, xylan and pectins) of sugar beet pulp was conducted at the temperature of 45 ± 1 °C and pH of 5.5 with mixing for 10 h. Additionally, at the end of the hydrolysis process, the temperature was raised to 80 °C, which deactivated the enzymes. The characteristics of substrates used for the investigation are shown in Table 1."
4,Experimental setup and operational conditions,"2.3 Experimental setup and operational conditions Semi-continuous tests were carried out in three identical reactors, cylindrical in shape, made of glass. Each reactor had a total volume of 3 dm3 and a working volume of 1 dm3. The reactors were placed in a thermostat to maintain constant mesophilic temperature of 35 ± 1 °C. Each digester was coupled to a 4 dm3 gas collecting tank to measure daily biogas production by a water displacement method, and to provide strict anaerobic conditions. The digesters were operated semi-continuously with feeding and discharge performed once a day using a peristaltic pump. Initially, the reactors were filled with 700 g of the substrates and 300 g of inoculum to initialize the digestion process. Then the reactors were flushed with nitrogen gas for around 5 min to ensure anaerobic conditions. As fresh substrates were too dense to be pumped into the reactors, thus they had to be diluted with water. Moreover, different dilutions were applied to recognize the best operating conditions. The pH values of all fresh substrates were close to 4, which was too low for dark fermentation. Hence, pH was adjusted by adding 20% NaOH solution to the feed. Based on the previous findings [12–14], initially, a solids retention time (SRT) of 3 days was established for all the feedstocks used. However, as discussed later, sugar beet pulp needed longer retention time due to the process instability under SRT of 3 days. Operating conditions and performance of the reactors are summarized in Table 2 , whereas an installation for the experiments is illustrated in Fig. S1."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Total and volatile solids (TS, VS) as well as pH were determined according to the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater [15]. Chemical oxygen demand (COD), total ammonium nitrogen (TAN) and ortophosphates were determined using a DR6000 spectrophotometer (HACH-LANGE, Loveland, USA) and HACH-Lange tests no. 8000, 8038 and 8048, respectively. The tests were conducted according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Elemental composition (C, N, H, P, S) was determined using a Flash Elemental Analyzer (Thermo Finnigan, Italy), following the manufacturer’s procedures. The total carbon was divided by the total nitrogen to obtain the C/N ratio. Total volatile fatty acids (TVFA) in the supernatant were measured by a HACH-Lange method LCK365 and a DR6000 spectrophotometer. Individual volatile fatty acids were also quantified with a high performance liquid chromatography using a Finnigan Surveyor chromatograph (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, USA) coupled with an Aminex HPX 87H column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA), and a refractive index detector. Separation during the HPLC tests was performed using sulfuric acid (5 mmol/L) as a mobile phase, which was applied at a flow rate of 0.6 cm3/min. The concentration of lactate ions was also measured spectrophotometrically using a d-/l-Lactic Acid (K-DLATE) Assay Kit (Megazyme, Bray, Ireland). For determination of methanol a GC-FID analysis was conducted on an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph (Santa Clara, CA, USA), equipped with a FID detector, a split/splitless injector, and a capillary column (HP-Innowax, 60 m × 0.32 mm inner diameter × 0.50 μm film thickness; Agilent). Each sample was injected (1 μl) using an autosampler in a split mode (1:45). The temperature of the injector and FID was kept at 250 °C. The oven temperature program was as follows: 40 °C initial, 6 min hold; 2 °C min−1 to 80 °C; 5 °C min−1 to 210 °C final, 5 min hold. The flow rate of the carrier gas (helium) through the column was 2 cm3/min. The saccharide profile of substrates and digestates was measured using a UV-spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific Multiskan GO; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Munich, Germany) and Megazyme Kits (Megazyme Ltd, Bray, Ireland): D-xylose assay kit (K-XYLOSE), D-glucuronic acid and D-galacturonic acid assay kit (K-URONIC), raffinose/D-galactose assay kit (K-RAFGA), the d-mannose, D-fructose and D-glucose assay kit (K-MANGL), the L-arabinose and d-galactose assay kit (K-ARGA) and L-rhamnose assay kit (K-RHAMNOSE). The analyses were conducted according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Biogas yield was monitored on a daily basis by the water displacement method as described anywhere in the literature [16]. Biogas composition was analyzed using a portable gas analyzer GA-21plus (Madur, Poland), equipped with electrochemical sensors, which measured the concentrations of O2, H2 , CO2, CH4 and H2S."
6,Metagenomics survey of microbial populations,"2.5 Metagenomics survey of microbial populations The first step, which is the most crucial is sample processing. The extracted DNA should be representative of all cells in the entire content of the digester. The sample was collected twice for every substrate, which corresponds to long time of process. DNA was extracted from 0.7g of hydrolyses sugar beet pulp, fruit and vegetable waste and maize silage (each sample after dark fermentation) using FastDNA™ SPIN Kit (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA, USA). The protocol for DNA extraction was based on the manufacturer’s guidelines. DNA was quantified by using a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Carlsband, Ca, USA). The bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified by using universal prokaryotic primers, 341 F and 785 R targeting the V3–V4 regions. All PCR reactions were conducted in triplicate in 50 μL containing 5 μL of DNA as a template, 25 μL of NEBNext® Hot Start High-Fidelity 2 × PCR Master Mix (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and 10 pmol of each primer. The amplification of bacterial fragments was lead in few steps: initial denaturation (98 °C for 30 s), followed by 15 cycles of denaturation (98 °C for 10 s), annealing (52 °C for 75 s), extension (65 °C for 75 s), final extension (65 °C for 5 min). DNA libraries were constructed by using the Nextera Index Kit according to the library preparation protocol for short amplicons (2 × 250 bp) provided by the manufacturer. Paired-end (PE, 2 × 250 nt) sequencing was performed on the Illumina MiSeq (MiSeq Reagent kit v2) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) at Genomed (Warsaw, Poland)."
7,Statistical analysis,"2.6 Statistical analysis All the analytical tests were performed in triplicates. The mean and standard deviation values, error bars were calculated in Microsoft Excel 2010 and in R version 3.5.0."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characteristic of substrates and inoculum,"3.1 Characteristic of substrates and inoculum The characteristic of FVW, SBP and CS are shown in Table 1. Earlier study revealed that hydrogen could hardly be produced from raw sugar beet pulp (only 31 dm3 H2/kg VS). However, when the SBP was enzymatically hydrolyzed, significant quantities of hydrogen could be generated [17]. The hydrogen yield from enzymatically pretreated SBP was therefore 5-times greater and reached 150 dm3 H2/kg VS. Based on this finding, the semi-continuous experiments were performed with enzymatically pretreated SBP. Fruit and vegetable waste had the average solids concentration of 148 g/kg, of which organic fraction represented around 85%TS. The average total solids concentration of fresh corn silage was 410 g/kg with organic fraction of only 31%TS, whereas the corresponding values for sugar beet pulp were 204 g/kg, and 95%TS, respectively. Considering nutrient content, typically, the inoculum was rich in nitrogen (3.17%TS) and phosphorus (2.02%TS). Fruit and vegetable waste was also abundant in nitrogen (6.91%TS) whereas the content of phosphorus was only around 0.32%TS. In contrast, beet pulp displayed a very low concentration of both phosphorus (0.02%TS) and nitrogen (0.1%TS). The deficiency of micro- and macro nutrients in SBP has been reported in many studies [18,19]. Sugar beet pulp was the most abundant in simple sugars compared to the other materials. The main sugars detected in the liquid fraction of SBP were raffinose, glucose, galactose and arabinose. Glucose is a product of cellulose hydrolysis, whereas galactose and arabinose are the components of hemicelluloses and pectins. In turn, raffinose is a trisaccharide composed of glucose, galactose and fructose, also found in sugar beets [20]. The main sugars found in FVW were fructose, mannose and glucose, which can be linked to the significant fraction of fruit in this material. In contrast, corn silage was characterized by low sugar content probably due to the substrate origin and short ensilage period. However, as literature shows [21] CS from the whole plant after enzymatic pretreatment contains approximately 54.4 g/dm3 of glucose and 7.5 g/dm3 of xylose."
10,Process performance,"3.2 Process performance Table 2 summarizes operating parameters and performances of the dark fermentation experiments. Specific hydrogen and methane productions (SHP, SMP) were examined as important responses (Figs. 1–3 ). They showed hydrogen production potential and were found to vary as a function of changes in the process parameters: pH, SRT and OLR. The experiments with sugar beet pulp started with an SRT = 3 d and a corresponding OLR = 12.55 gVS/m3•d (SBP-1). Under these conditions the biogas and hydrogen production was very unstable as the amount of hydrogen fluctuated from 11.23 to 65.03 cm3/gVS with an average of 26.30 cm3/gVS, and biogas H2 content of 43.31%. To improve the generation of hydrogen, in SBP-2 experimental run the SRT was extended to 5 days and OLR dropped to 9.98 gVS/m3•d. Although the process was still unstable with rapid fluctuations of daily biogas yields, the average hydrogen yield in this run reached 35.62 cm3/gVS. Hence, in run SBP-3 at the same SRT of 5 days, an OLR value was further reduced to 8.02 gVS/m3•d. Under such conditions, the hydrogen production was more stable with average yield of 37.16 cm3/gVS. Changes in hydrogen yield were not as rapid as in case of SBP-2. However, after five weeks of operation, the hydrogen production significantly dropped to around 10 cm3/gVS. Interestingly, although the pH value in the digester was 5.48 on average (close to the ideal for dark fermentation – Van Ginkel and Logan, Wang and Zhao) [23,24] apart from hydrogen, a considerable methane production was also observed. The approximate methane yield in SBP-3 was 4.91 cm3/gVS and biogas methane content was nearly 5%. This implies that lower OLR favored both hydrogen and methane yield during dark fermentation despite low pH. In the last experimental run (SBP-4), the SRT value was lowered again to 3 days and the OLR value was set at 16.21 gVS/m3•d. This resulted in a deterioration in both hydrogen production and process stability. The average hydrogen yield dropped to 16.50 cm3/gVS and at the same time a significant methane production of 4.93 cm3/gVS was observed. Moreover, the methane percentage of biogas exceeded 10%, which was twice as high as the corresponding value reported in SBP-3 run. A very low hydrogen yield in SBP-4 run could be due to the growth of methanogens and acetic acid bacteria (Acetobacteriaceae) in that experiment (Fig. 5). The former utilize hydrogen for methane production whereas bacteria from Acetobacteriaceae family produce acetic acid from sugars with no hydrogen yield, as discussed in the next sections. The experiments with fruit and vegetable waste were performed with the same SRT of 3 days, whereas in the subsequent runs the substrate density and OLR value were increasing. The highest hydrogen yield of 52.1 cm3/gVS was obtained in FVW-2 run operated at OLR of approximately 15 gVS/m3•d and this was the greatest H2 production reported in the whole study. This yield was comparable to the hydrogen production of 55 cm3/gVS obtained in batch experiments with food waste reported by Nathao et al. [25]. Furthermore, the biogas contained as much as 52% H2 with only around 1.3% CH4, hence, the activity of methanogens was insignificant. However, when OLR was increased to 17.56 cm3/gVS (FWV-3), hydrogen production significantly decreased to 30.29 cm3/gVS, and this could be linked to the increased concentration of lactic acid and low content of butyric acid detected in that run, as discussed below. The hydrogen yields form FVW obtained in our study are generally lower to the values reported in the literature values reported in the literature [1,17,25]. However, the cited authors performed their experiments in batch conditions, which are close to ideal and almost always give higher hydrogen yields compared to the values obtained in semi-continuous trials. Batch tests are performed with high amount of inoculum, which provides the necessary nutrients like phosphorus as well as microorganisms. Another reason of higher hydrogen production reported in the literature is specific composition of waste. Kitchen waste is more diverse as it consists of vegetable, fruit, as well as meat, plant and animal fats, fish, which could provide various nutrients, sometimes more easily available for microorganisms. Fig. 3 illustrates the hydrogen and methane productions from corn silage. For that substrate, only two experimental runs were performed due to a specific character of this material. Although CS was ground and diluted with water, there were problems with its pumping as the wires tended to clog. Moreover, despite mixing, CS easily settled and accumulated on the bottom of the digester leading to a gradual decrease of its active volume. This might be one of the reasons of limited studies dealing with this material. The CS experiments were performed with two OLR values of 27.53 and 23.67 gVS/m3•d. The hydrogen yield from corn silage was moderate reaching only 26.63 cm3/gVS, which was much lower than the values reported in the literature (81.5 cm3/gTS by Ivanova et al. [26]) as well as in our earlier batch tests (115.28 cm3/gVS) [17]. It is worth noting that low hydrogen yield from corn silage could be linked to low amount of sugars (7.69 g/l) in that material, nearly tenfold lower than in SBP (Table 1). Another possible reason of low hydrogen production is relatively high loading rate, in contrast to the values applied in SBP and FWV experiments. Interestingly, the biogas from CS experiments was relatively rich in hydrogen (around 50%) with only negligible percentage of methane (below 0.5%)."
11,Substrate degradation and metabolic products,"3.3 Substrate degradation and metabolic products The analysis of the metabolic products provides useful information on the evolution of the DF process and can be used to explain the observed H2 and CH4 generation yields. It is generally known that pH is one of the most important factors affecting hydrogen production in dark fermentation. The optimal pH values reported in the literature vary between 5 and 7, depending on the substrate type and process conditions with peak hydrogen production often recorded at pH = 5.5 [3,13,16,22]. Generally the reactors operated with no pH control showed a gradual pH drop to 4.0 and production of hydrogen ceased. This was particularly visible in sugar beet pulp experiments. Hence, each reactor operated in this study was supplemented with 20% NaOH to increase alkalinity. The optimal pH in SBP and CS experiments was around 5.5 whereas for FVW slightly higher (5.6–6.0). Lee et al. [27] also reported higher optimal values in food waste dark fermentation within the range of 6–7. Apart from pH, the stability of dark fermentation also depends on the concentration and profile of volatile fatty acids. The profiles of individual fatty acids are depicted in Fig. 4 . Generally five acids were only detected in the digestates with acetic and lactic being the predominant ones. This corresponds to the high abundance of lactic acid producing bacteria detected in all experimental runs as discussed in the next section. As shown in Fig. 1, the SBP-1 and SBP-2 runs were highly unstable and this corresponded with great lactic acid production of over 10,000 g/m3. The average concentrations of acetic acid in SBP-1 and SBP-2 runs were 16,648 g/m3 and 10,209 g/m3, respectively. It was found in our previous study [28] that as much as 50 g/l of lactic acid can be achieved via fermentation of enzymatically hydrolyzed sugar beet pulp by the action of Lactobacillus strains including L. lactic, L. acidophilus, L. delbrueckii, L. plantarum and L. brevis. Moreover, these bacteria can use both hexoses and pentoses as carbon sources for lactic acid production. High concentrations of both lactic and acetic acids also corresponded with the greatest contents of ethanol of 1740–1810 g/m3 reported in the whole study (Table 3 ). This may suggest that lactic acid could have been produced via both homofertemtation and heterofermentation pathway [29]. In SBP-3 experiment the concentration of lactic acid substantially dropped to 863 g/m3 whereas acetic acid slightly decreased to 8144 g/m3. Simultaneously, more butyric acid was detected in this run (2315 g/m3 on average). These values corresponded with the highest hydrogen yield reported in sugar beet pulp experiments. Great instability and high concentrations of lactic acids reported in SBP-1 and SBPR-2 can be linked to the highest abundance of Lactobacillaceae bacteria (Fig. 5), which, in turn, could inhibit hydrogen production [3,30] as discussed in the next section. On the other hand, in experiment SBP-3 the concentration of butyric acid increased giving a butyric-to-acetic acid ration of 0.28, which was closer to the range of 0.80–0.85 regarded as optimal for dark fermentative hydrogen production [16]. Interestingly, the profile of fatty acids reported in SBP-4 run was similar to the VFA profile in SBP-3, however in the SBP-4 experiment the average hydrogen production dropped to 16 cm3/gVS. In both experimental runs, apart from hydrogen, also methane was produced at comparable levels of around 5 cm3/gVS. However, in SBP-3 methane accounted for 4.93% of biogas whereas in SBP-4 that contribution exceeded 10%. This may suggest that in both runs, most lactic acid was decomposed into methane [31] but in SBP-4 run a part of hydrogen might also have been converted into methane. The experiments with fruit and vegetable waste showed a similar behavior of fatty acids to that observed in runs with sugar beet pulp. As shown in Fig. 2, the hydrogen production in FWV-1 was associated with the highest lactic acid release of over 12,000 g/m3, which undoubtedly inhibited dark fermentation process. Acetic acid was the second predominant carboxylic acid with the average content of 10,548 g/m3. The average concentrations of propionic and butyric acids were 2229 g/m3 and 3990 g/m3, respectively, and these values were much greater than the corresponding ones determined for SBP. A considerable production of lactic acid in FWV-1 run was inhibitory to hydrogen production as discussed above. Likewise, the hydrogen yield was likely to be affected by propionic acid because hydrogen cannot be produced via propionate production pathway [32,33]. On the other hand however, larger concentration of butyric acid gave higher butyric-to-acetic acid ratio of 0.38, which was favorable for hydrogen production. The concentrations of all determined acids significantly dropped in FWV-2 experiments for which a maximum hydrogen yield was detected. However, in FWV-2 the level of lactic acid increased again to over 10,000 g/m3, as a result hydrogen production was lowered. Considering corn silage experiments, the profiles of fatty acids generally followed the same trends observed in the SBP and FWV runs. In CS-1 experiment, lactic and acetic acids were the main metabolic products among VFAs detected with the average concentrations of 8106 g/m3 and 7270 g/m3, respectively. In CS-2 run, the concentrations of acetic acid and especially lactic acid dropped to 6508 g/m3 and 3616 g/m3, respectively, whereas more butyric acid was detected, and this can be linked to the greater hydrogen yield of 27 cm3/gVS compared to 24 cm3/gVS in CS-1. It is widely known that in dark fermentation processes, hydrogen is basically produced from simple sugars. Hence, in this research, the changes in sugar contents during digestion and potential links between individual sugars and hydrogen production were also investigated. The concentrations of sugars in fresh materials and the digestates are summarized in Tables 1 and 3. Hydrolyzed sugar beet pulp was the most abundant in sugars among all the materials used in this study. The sum of simple sugars measured in SBP was 77.8 g/dm3, wherein raffinose, glucose, galactose and arabinose were the predominant ones (Table 1). During dark fermentation, hexoses were degraded in 90% and more whereas arabinose in around 80%. This proved that both hexoses and pentoses can successively be used for hydrogen production, however, the latter ones are less-favorable for fermentation as discussed by Berlowska et al. [28]. According to the cited authors, especially glucose and fructose can be metabolized almost completely, which was also confirmed in this study. It is worth noting that the highest sugar content in SBP corresponded with the lowest amount of nutrients (0.21% N and only 0.02% P) as shown in Table 1, and this may also explain only a moderate hydrogen production obtained from this substrate. Regarding fruit and vegetable waste, the main sugars detected in fresh material were fructose, mannose and glucose, and the total sugar content was 37.8 g/m3. Interestingly, the content of pentoses was generally low suggesting that FWV can be a better substrate for hydrogen production. As with SBP, dark fermentation of FWV resulted in an almost complete utilization of monohexoses (glucose, fructose and mannose) whereas the other sugars were degraded to a lesser extent. Compared to SBP and FWV, corn silage showed much lower concentrations of sugars, which averaged 7.7 g/m3. Glucose and raffinose were predominant sugars found in fresh CS, however, their concentrations reached only around 2 g/m3. After dark fermentation, the sugar contents were at comparable levels to the corresponding values reported in the FWV digestates. It might also be concluded that the low sugar content in corn silage could be linked to a relatively low hydrogen yield from this material. The literature concerning the behavior of sugars during dark fermentation is very limited. Guo et al. [33] found that reducing sugars in corn stalk were almost completely degraded by hydrogen fermentation. The authors also observed an increase in acetic and butyric acid concentrations in proportion to the decrease in the level of sugars."
12,Analysis of the microbial communities,"3.4 Analysis of the microbial communities The samples of digestates as well as inoculum were collected to analyze microbial communities in the reactors. DNA sequencing data revealed the presence of 61 families belonging to 2 domains, 10 phyla and 20 classes in digested sugar beet pulp, fruit and vegetable waste and corn silage (Fig. 5). The main observation was a visible effect of the inoculum on the microbial structure of the digested materials. The inoculum was very diverse and contained both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms, including H2-consumers (non-spore-forming bacteria and methanogens) and H2-producers (endospore-forming bacteria including Clostridium and Bacillus genera). A number of bacteria found in the inoculum were originated from activated sludge whereas such families as Syntrophaceae, Methanobacteriaceae were closely related to the sludge stabilization process in anaerobic digesters. Dark fermentation resulted in selection of microorganisms and considerable reduction of microbial diversity. In SBP digestate, Lactobacillaceae was most abundant family, which accounted for 36–59% of all microorganisms in SBP trials, depending on the OLR applied. Lactobacillus was the dominant genus within the Lactobacillaceae family and its abundance, especially in SBP-1 run (59%) corresponded with the high concentration of lactic acid (Fig. 4). Earlier study demonstrated that various Lactobacillus species could grow on both hexoses and pentoses [28] and the hydrolyzed SBP was abundant in these sugars (Table 1) as discussed in the previous section. The SRT value of 3–5 days applied in the experiments was ideal for the growth of these microorganisms, because the generation time of Lactobacillus sp. generally varies between 24 and 36 h. Unfortunately, an intensive growth of Lactobacillus sp. in a digester could inhibit or even stop hydrogen production in dark fermentation reactors. It was reported that Lactobacilli compete for substrate with hydrogen-producing bacteria, which leads to system instability like in our study [32]. Lactic acid bacteria can also inhibit the hydrogen-producing bacteria by acidification the environment and by release of antimicrobial agents like hydrogen peroxide or bacteriocins [3,34]. On the other hand, the Clostridium species hardly generates hydrogen from lactic acid [30,35]. Bacteria from the order Clostridiales, accounted for 23–29% of all detected microorganisms in SBP experiments with the main families of Mogibacteriaceae, (11–18% relative abundance) and Ruminococcaceae (4–12% relative abundance). These bacteria are regarded as the major group of hydrogen-producers in dark fermentation systems. High relative abundance of Mogibacteriaceae can be linked to their capacity to synthesize cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes [36]. Mogibacteriaceae were also quite frequent in inoculum used to start the experiments. Ruminococcaceae, in turn, almost exclusively represented by the Ruminococcus genus, are fibrolytic bacteria that produce hydrogen mostly from hemicelluloses [37]. The highest relative abundance of Ruminococcus (12%) was reported in SBP-4 run, and corresponded with the highest percentage of Acetobacteraceae (14%). Furthermore, in that run, around 1.7% of microorganisms were affiliated with Methanosphaera genus, which belongs to the domain Archae. Acetobacteraceae is a family of gram-minus bacteria, which can metabolize sugars and ethanol into organic acids, including acetic, citric and lactic acid [38]. The appearance of Methanosphaera is surprising because methanogens are basically grow at a pH range of 6–8 [33], whereas the pH value in the reactors was kept at approximately 5.5 (Table 3). However, it has been reported that some methanogens, including the genus Methanosphaera, can grow and produce methane under acidic conditions at pH values of 5 or even less [39,40]. Methanogens grow slowly, particularly in acidic environment, which explains their activity only after several weeks since the beginning of the SBP runs. Furthermore, the growth of Methanosphaera corresponded with the increased abundance of Ruminococcus. As described in the literature [41] Ruminococcus often grows with methanogens (including the genus Methanosphaera) where both microbial groups are involved in interspecies hydrogen transport according to which hydrogen produced by bacteria is rapidly consumed by methanogens. Considering metagenomic profiles of the FVW digestates, the primary bacterial families identified were Coriobacteriaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Mogibacteriaceae as well as Prevotellaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae observed in further runs (Fig. 5). At the order level, Clostridiales represented 20–24% of all microorganisms detected, however, within this order, Mogibacteriaceae dominated only in FVW-1 run. In FVW-2 run, in which the highest H2-production was observed, the main Clostridiales families were Mogibacteriaceae (15%), Vellonellaceae (9%) and Ruminococcaceae (6%), whereas the corresponding values reported in FVW-3 run the percentage of Mogibacteriaceae decreased to 5. Bacteria from the family Vellonellaceae can utilize lactic acid into acetic, propionic, butyric and valeric acids [42]. Moreover, some Vellonellaceae species, especially from the genus Acidaminococcus, are able to produce hydrogen in the presence of sodium ions [43]. Considering lactic acid producing bacteria (LAB), Coriobacteriaceae dominated in FVW1 and FVW-2 runs (31% and 21% of relative abundance, respectively), whereas in FVW-3 run, the primary LAB were Prevotellaceae (32%) and Bifidobacteriaceae (17%). It is noteworthy to highlight the highest lactic acid yield determined in FVW-1 experiment in which the relative abundance of lactic acid producing bacteria (as the sum of Lactobacillaceae, Bifidobacteriaceae, Coriobacteriaceae and Prevotellaceae) was nearly 60% of microbes (a similar relationship was observed in SBP-1 experiment as discussed earlier). Coriobacteriaceae is the family of gram-positive non-spore forming fermentative bacteria that produces organic acids with no hydrogen generation. Some Coriobacteriaceae species, especially from the genus Olsenella, have characteristics similar to Lactobacillus sp., hence they can compete with hydrogen-producing bacteria [34,44]. Prevotellaceae, in turn, represented by the genus Prevotella, were found in the greatest abundance (32%) in FVW-3 digestate. These bacteria can degrade hemicelluloses into acetic acid and CO2, however some species (e.g. P.albensis) could also produce considerable amounts of hydrogen [36,37]. Many Prevotella species also show a proteolytic activity, hence, their greater abundance can be linked to the higher content of proteins in fruit and vegetable waste [45]. Likewise Lactobacillus sp., some scientists observed secretion of bacteriocins by Prevotella sp., which might inhibit hydrogen production [34]. As mentioned earlier, corn silage was the substrate difficult to feed, and the digestate samples, especially from CS-1 run, were not homogenous. For this reason, the metagenomic profile was only made for CS-2 digestate. The results of this analysis revealed a high abundance of Bifidobacterium sp. (25%) and relatively low abundance of Lactobacilllus sp. (10%), compared to the SBP and FVW runs. The order Clostridiales represented 25% of all microorganisms among which Mogibacteriaceae (16%) and Clostridiaceae (4%) were two predominant families. The appearance of Enterobacteriaceae (10%) is also noteworthy. High abundance of Bifidobacterium sp. can be linked to the presence of starch in corn silage, which is degraded by these bacteria into simpler molecules readily available by hydrogen-consuming organisms [46]. The genus Bifidobacterium belongs to the group of lactic acid bacteria, which produces acetic acid and lactic acid in 3:2 M ratio. The appearance of Bifidobacterium sp. in CS-1 as well as in FVW-2 and FVW-3 can be explained by higher pH of the digestates (Table 3) because these bacteria have a lower acid tolerance [29]. Regarding the family Enterobacteriaceae, these bacteria are capable to produce hydrogen from organic acids and some alcohols (e.g. 2,3-butanediol), but hydrogen yield gained in this way is lower than the production obtained by the activity of Clostridiales [3]."
13,Conclusions,"This study showed that sugar beet pulp after enzymatic pretreatment is abundant in sugars and can be used for hydrogen production. However, the dark fermentation process was unstable due to the high activity of lactic acid bacteria and the presence of methanogens, which could grow despite low pH in the digester. More stable digestion operation and greater hydrogen yield of up to 52 cm3/gVS was achieved for fruit and vegetable waste, however, hydrogen production was diminished by lactic acid secretion. In contrast, corn silage turned out to be a rather poor substrate for hydrogen production due to the low sugar content and specific character of this material, which rapidly settled and could hardly be pumped. The analysis of microbiota revealed that the primary hydrogen-producing bacteria were affiliated to the families Mogibacteriaceae and Ruminococcaceae, whereas little or no Clostriduim species were detected. On the other hand, lactic acid producing bacteria constituted as much as 40–60% of all detected microbes, and were mainly represented by Lactobacillaceae, Coriobacteriaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae at a family level. Lastly, a noticeable percentage of microbes were affiliated to the genus Methanosphaera, and this observation proves that methanogens can grow in dark fermentation systems and lower hydrogen production."
