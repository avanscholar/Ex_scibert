0,Introduction,"Higher alcohols (C2+OH) have attracted significant interest for their extensive applications. They are considered as attractive fuel additives and feedstocks to synthesize high value-added chemical products such as lubricants, plastics and detergents. [1–3] Traditionally, ethanol was mainly produced through sugar fermentation, while butanol and other long-chain alcohols were mostly obtained from the hydration of petroleum-derived light olefins [4]. With the declination of petroleum reserves and increasing demand for clean fuel, alternative routes via non-petroleum-based resources have drawn increasing attention. The direct synthesis from syngas (CO + H2), which can be derived from coal, biomass or natural gas, is one of the most promising approaches due to its economy and environment-friendly features. [5,6] Co-based catalysts modified by Cu have been extensively studied owing to its superior activity and relatively high selectivity to higher alcohols under mild reaction conditions. Most studies suggest that metallic Co catalyzes CO dissociation while metallic Cu favors CO adsorption and insertion. [7–9] For CuCo-based catalysts, Cu-Co alloy was assumed to be the active site for higher alcohol synthesis (HAS) [10]. The close contact between Cu and Co sites is thus critical for increasing higher alcohols yield. However, the bulk Cu-Co alloy is unstable due to the low solubility of these two metals. The dealloying would result in the deactivation of the catalyst and the formation of byproducts [11,12]. In recent years, some researchers have proposed that Co2C played a significant role in the formation of higher alcohols as well. Baker and coworkers [13] claimed that higher alcohols could be produced over Co/SiO2 without additives, and the characterization results evidenced that Co0 and Co2+ species were responsible for HAS. It was demonstrated that CO could be linearly adsorbed on Co2C sites, which was essential for CO nondissociative adsorption. [14,15] Furthermore, Pei et al. [16] presented a combined experimental and theoretical study to investigate the role of Co and Co2C. They concluded that Co2C sites were efficient for CO molecularly adsorption while metallic Co was active for dissociative CO adsorption. The Co-Co2C interface was found to be essential for CO insertion. These studies demonstrated that Co-Co2C species could act as efficient active sites for HAS. The formation of carbide in Co-based catalysts thus attracted increasing attention. Lebarier et al. [17] pointed out that the amount of Co2C significantly depended on La2O3 promoter, and the formation of Co2C was energetically favorable. In addition, several studies were performed to explore the promotional effect of carbon materials. It was reported that graphene and carbon polymer matrix could enhance the formation of iron carbides species. [18,19] Zhang and coworkers [20,21] demonstrated an appropriate addition of CNTs would increase CO conversion and alcohol selectivity in HAS. They also found that CNTs-free catalysts were rich in Co0 while the CNTs promoted catalysts contained more Con+. However, the identification of Co species and the mechanism of how carbon materials influenced Con+ formation was not mentioned. Thus, a further understanding of the promotion effect of carbon materials on cobalt carbide species is quite necessary for the reasonable design of catalysts. Graphene oxide (GO), a two-dimensional sheet of graphitic carbon, is an attractive material applied in many areas due to its superior electronic properties and high mechanical strength. Herein, GO-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) composite were synthesized as supports of cobalt catalysts for HAS. To better understand the role of GO in carbide formation and CO hydrogenation, the catalysts with different GO contents were prepared and characterized systematically. Based on quantitative analysis of cobalt species, relationships among GO-OMS support properties, Co-Co2C dual sites distribution, and correspondingly catalytic performance were well established, which may provide new possibilities in design and fabrication of efficient catalysts for HAS."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Graphite powder (99.8 wt.%) and NaNO3 (99.0 wt.%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. KMnO4 (99.5 wt.%) and HCl (36.0–38.0 wt.%) were purchased from Tianjin Jiangtian Chemical Technology Co. H2SO4 (95.0–98.0 wt.%), tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, 99.0 wt.%), H2O2 (30.0 wt.%) and Co(NO3)·6H2O (98.5 wt.%) were all purchased from Tianjin Kemiou Chemical Reagent Co. Pluronic P123 (EO20PO70EO20) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All the chemicals were used as received without any pretreatment."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation GO was synthesized by oxidation of graphite powder according to Hummers method [22]. Typically, the mixture of graphite powders and NaNO3 were stirred in 46 mL of 98% H2SO4 in the condition of iced bath. KMnO4 was gradually added to the above solution at 2 °C. The mixture was then stirred at 35 °C for 4 h and 60 mL of deionized water was added. The resulting mixture was further stirred at 98 °C for 15 min. Then 100 mL of deionized water followed by a 30 wt.% H2O2 solution was added and stirred for 30 min. The resulting mixture was filtered and washed several times with HCl solution and deionized water until the pH value maintained at 7. After centrifugation, the obtained GO dispersion (1.20 mg/mL) was used in the following preparation of GO-OMS composite. As shown in Scheme 1 , GO was suspended in 30 mL of deionized water. Then the suspension was mixed with 4.0 g of Pluronic P123 and 2 M HCl aqueous solution under stirring for 10 h. Then TEOS was added. After aging at 40 °C for 24 h, the solution was transferred to autoclave and treated at 100 °C for 24 h. The obtained mixture was washed with deionized water, dried and calcined at 600 °C for 4 h in N2 flow. The obtained sample is denoted as xGO-OMS, where x defined as the weight percentage of GO relative to the composite support. The above process without GO solution is the typical synthesis of OMS support. The Co/OMS and Co/xGO-OMS catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method with cobalt nitrate. After exposed in air for 24 h at room temperature, the samples were dried at 50 °C for 12 h under vacuum condition. Finally, the samples were calcined at 400 °C for 4 h in N2 flow."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The cobalt content of catalysts was determined on an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Varian Vista-MPX). Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was performed in air by using a TG 209F3 analyzer (NETZSCH). The samples were hated from 35 to 1000 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in air flow. Hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was carried out by Micromeritics Atuchem II 2920 unit with thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction-mass spectrometry (H2-TPR-MS) was performed by the same reactor equipped with HPR-20 QIC gas analysis system. The calcined catalyst was first treated at 200 °C in Ar for 1 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the catalysts were then heated to 1000 °C in 10 vol. %H2/Ar, and the heating rate was 10 °C/min. Raman spectra was analyzed by DXR-Microscope at room temperature. All spectra were recorded between 50 and 3500 cm−1 with 5 accumulations of 120 s each. The scanning electron micrograph (SEM) characterizations were obtained by using a Hitachi S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a JEOL JEM-2100 F microscope field-emission transmission electron microscope. The sample was crushed and ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol. The obtained suspension was then dropped and dried on a Cu grid with a layer of carbon film. Nitrogen adsorption was analyzed at −196 °C on ASAP 2020 instrument. Samples were degassed at 300 °C under N2 flow for 3 h before analysis. The surface area of sample was calculated according to the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted with a Rigaku C/max-2500 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The identification of crystalline phases was analyzed using the JCPDS PDF library, and the particle size was calculated by the Scherrer equation. For semi-quantitative analysis, the samples were scanned from 39 to 48° at a scanning rate of 1°/min. The fraction of cobalt carbide and metallic cobalt were calculated by the following equation, where I is the intensity of the most intense peak of each phase obtained from fitting the XRD results, and reference intensity ratios (RIR) are available in PDF library. [23] ω x = I x R I R x ∑ i = 1 n I i R I R i X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) was collected on a Kratos XSAM 800 spectrometer using Al Kα (hν = 1486.6 eV) as the X-ray radiation source. The calcined catalysts were reduced in H2 at 430 °C for 10 h and carbonized in CO at 225 °C for 24 h, then cooled down to room temperature and immediately transferred into the chamber. The binding energy of Si 2p at 103.4 eV was used as the reference for correction. Zeta potential was performed on Malvern Nano ZS instrument. The solutions for Zeta potential measurement were prepared by dispersing 80 mg of GO-OMS support powder into 30 mL of deionized water. The in situ diﬀ ;use reﬂectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS) of CO adsorption were collected using a Thermo Scientific Nicolet 6700 spectrometer equipped with a MCT/A detector. The catalysts (20 mg) powders were placed in the cell and reduced under a hydrogen flow of 30 mL/min for 2 h at 430 °C and then cooled down to 225 °C. Subsequently, the background spectra were scanned and CO was fed to the cell. The in situ DRIFTS spectra were collected until it no longer changed over 30 min. The amount of CO uptake and cobalt dispersion were measured by pulsed CO chemisorption using a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 unit. 100 mg of sample was reduced in H2 flow at 430 °C for 2 h, followed by purging with He at the same temperature for 30 min and then cooled down to 30 °C. Subsequently, the pulse CO chemisorption was performed with 10% CO/He until the peak area no longer changed."
5,Catalytic activity evaluation,"2.4 Catalytic activity evaluation The catalytic evaluation was carried out in a fixed-bed reaction system. 0.2 g of catalysts, diluted with quartz were placed in the certain part of the reaction tube where the temperature was constant. Catalysts were reduced in hydrogen at 430 °C for 10 h, then carbonized by CO at 225 °C for 24 h. Subsequently, the pressure was increased to 3.0 MPa and a mixture of feed gas (H2/CO/N2 = 6/3/1, GHSV = 10,800 mL/(gcat·h)) was switched into the reaction system. Catalytic activity and product selectivity were measured when the reaction was steady. During the reaction, the outlet gas products were analyzed online using Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph. CO, CO2, CH4, H2, N2 were analyzed by thermal conductivity detector (TCD) using N2 as the reference gas. The analysis of hydrocarbons from C1 to C6 were performed by flame ionization detector (FID). The liquid products were offline analyzed on Agilent 4890B by internal standard method using sec-butyl alcohol as the reference. CO conversion and product selectivity (Si) were calculated on a carbon basis. C O C o n v e r s i o n = C O i n l e t - C O o u t l e t C O i n l e t × 100 % S i = n C i C O i n l e t - C O o u t l e t × 100 % Where COinlet and COoutlet represent moles of CO in the feed gas and outlet gas, respectively. n and Ci represent carbon atoms number in the molecule and the moles of a carbon-containing product, respectively."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Textural properties of GO-OMS support,"3.1 Textural properties of GO-OMS support To investigate whether the GO-OMS composite support was successfully synthesized, SEM and TEM images of GO-OMS support were recorded. As shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. S1, GO and OMS composites are successfully combined in the self-assembled process. GO sheets are partly coated on the surface of OMS (Fig. 1 A and B), and another part of GO sheets are embedded in the bulk of OMS as shown in the yellow square in Fig. 1(C and D). The two combining forms of OMS with GO are determined by the designed special synthetic method (Scheme 1). Surface morphology of P123 surfactant at interface strongly depends on the property of substrate. [24] As described in Scheme 1, GO was firstly suspended in aqueous solution, and then amphiphilic P123 surfactant absorbed on GO sheets forming highly dispersed GO-P123 solution. GO-OMS composite support could be finally obtained with the subsequent hydrolytic precipitation of TEOS. In this way, GO was introduced in the self-assembled process of P123, which was crucial for the interaction between GO sheets and OMS matrix. Thus, either covering OMS or inserting in OMS, GO could maintain good contact with subsequently impregnated active sites. Moreover, the length and width of GO sheets are several microns but the thickness is in nano size, which will easily lead to the folding between GO sheets. In this study, we introduced GO to insert into mesoporous silica, which could overcome the folding limitation to a certain degree. [25] To investigate the effect of GO addition on the structural properties of OMS support, low-angle XRD patterns of xGO-OMS supports were measured. As shown in Fig. S2, the (100), (110) and (200) reflection peaks of OMS are clearly visible in all patterns. Combined with the TEM images of GO-OMS composite support (given in Fig. S1), these results indicate that the ordered structure maintained after GO addition [26]. In addition, the surface area of xGO-OMS composites increases with the increasing addition of GO (Table 1 ). We deduce that it is caused by the GO stacks and the intercalated structure between GO sheets and OMS. The contents of GO are determined by the weight loss of calcined as-prepared xGO-OMS samples in TG and DTG analysis (Fig. 2 ). No obvious weight loss is observed in the OMS sample, indicating the completely decomposition of P123 during the calcination. There is a rapid weight loss in the range of 500–700 °C, which is assigned to the decomposition of GO in air. [27] The weight loss of xGO-OMS samples is 1.6 wt.%, 3.3 wt.% and 6.3 wt.%, respectively, which is in good agreement with the theoretical values of GO addition."
8,Morphology and particle distribution of Co/xGO-OMS,"3.2 Morphology and particle distribution of Co/xGO-OMS The cobalt loading of Co/xGO-OMS catalysts determined by ICP-OES is listed in Table 1. All catalysts have a similar Co loading, which is close to designed value of 12 wt.%. The reduction behavior of Co/xGO-OMS catalysts was studied by H2-TPR (Fig. S3). And we also measured the H2-TPR-MS profiles of Co/OMS and Co/3GO-OMS to demonstrate the influence of carbon decomposition. The signals of CH4 and CO at m/z = 16 and 28 were monitored and shown in Fig. S4, respectively. For Co/OMS catalyst, the peaks centered at 145, 220 and 450 °C represent a stepwise reduction process of Co3O4 → CoO → Co0 [28], and no obvious CH4 and CO signals were detected during the TPR process (Fig. S4A). As for Co/3GO-OMS, a shoulder peak at 600 °C is observed. Correspondingly, an apparent MS signal of CH4 is observed over the temperature range of 500–700 °C (Fig. S4B). Combined with TG results, this peak can be attributed to the carbon gasification. And a weak CO MS signal appears in the same range, which is due to the decomposition of surface oxygenic functional groups. [29] Thus, the shoulder peaks of Co/xGO-OMS catalysts at 600 °C detected by TCD are assigned to the gasification of GO materials. According to H2-TPR-MS and TG results, GO have decomposed completely before 800 °C. Nevertheless, relatively weak peaks at 850–1000 °C are observed in all catalysts in TCD signal, which belong to the tiny amount of difficultly reduced CoO species. [30] The calculated contents are listed in Table S1. It is demonstrated that all the catalysts have similar contents of difficultly reduced CoO species, which are as low as 2% of all cobalt species. XRD patterns of reduced Co/xGO-OMS catalyst was further measured to analyze the crystalline structure of cobalt species. As shown in Fig. S5, the broad diffraction peak centered at 22° corresponds to amorphous SiO2, and the peaks at 2θ of 44.2°, 51.5° and 75.8° are assigned to (111), (200) and (220) planes of metallic Co. Moreover, the XRD patterns show extremely weak and broad diffraction peaks of CoO, which implies that a little amount of difficultly reduced CoO species exists. Combined with H2-TPR results, it is indicated that Co species can be mostly reduced to metallic cobalt after reduction at 430 °C for 10 h. In addition, the sizes of Co particle calculated by Scherrer formula are shown in Table 1. The grain size of Co decreases slightly from 11.5 nm to 9.8 nm with the increment of GO contents. In order to identify the morphology of reduced Co/xGO-OMS catalysts, TEM images were shown in Fig. 3 . All the GO-OMS supports can maintain composite structural integrity after reduction. More wrinkled sheets can be discovered with the increasing addition of GO. In addition, Co nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed on GO-OMS support. Some particles are encapsulated into the pores and some are dispersed on GO sheets. The mean particle sizes were obtained by counting about 200 nanoparticles from TEM images. The observed grain size decreases from 9.3 nm to 8.4 nm with the increasing of GO addition (given in Table 1). Combined with the results of XRD, it is indicated that the addition of GO leads to a high dispersion of Co nanoparticles."
9,Effect of GO on the active species,"3.3 Effect of GO on the active species After the reduced catalysts were carbonized in CO atmosphere at 225 °C for 24 h, they were characterized by TEM, XRD and XPS to investigate the role of GO on the carbonization of Co species. The representative TEM images of carbonized Co/3GO-OMS are shown in Fig. 4 . There are no significant changes in GO-OMS composite morphology and no aggregation of Co particles after carbonization. As shown in Fig. 4(B), the lattice fringes of 2.11 Å and 2.19 Å are the characteristic interlayer spacing of Co2C (111) and Co2C (002) planes, and the lattice fringes of 2.04 Å is assigned to Co (111). [16,31] And the different diffraction planes assigned to Co (111), Co2C (111) and Co2C (002) could be clearly distinguished in the Fourier transform image (given in the inset of Fig. 4B). Because Co2C formed from the carbonization of metallic Co, Co and Co2C could keep close contact during reaction, which would greatly facilitate the synergistic catalysis of Co-Co2C dual sites. [16] In the previous study, Co/Co2C interface was proposed to be responsible for CO insertion, and the close contact between metallic Co and cobalt carbide dual sites could reduce the generation of byproducts. [32] Fig. 5 (A) shows the XRD patterns of carbonized Co/xGO-OMS catalysts. The diffraction peaks at 44.2°, 51.5° and 75.8° are assigned to metallic Co. According to H2-TPR results and XRD patterns of reduced catalysts, a tiny amount of difficultly reduced CoO existed. Though the overlap occurred between Co2C peak (2θ = 42.7°) and CoO peak (2θ = 42.4°), the peaks at 2θ of 41.5°and 45.7° can clearly demonstrate the existence of Co2C species. XRD results indicate that metallic Co and Co2C exist simultaneously in the carbonized catalysts. In order to obtain a semi-quantitative analysis of the Co2C percentage in cobalt species, the detailed XRD patterns of the carbonized Co/xGO-OMS catalysts were fitted and displayed in Fig. 5(B). The relative ratio of different species is calculated by the intensity of the most intense peak of each phase and RIR obtained from PDF library [23], which detailed information is shown in experimental section. The calculated relative ratios of Co2C to metallic Co are shown in Table S2. The ratio of Co2C to Co increases with increasing GO addition and reaches the highest value for Co/3GO-OMS. Thus, it indicates that addition of GO can promote the formation of Co2C species. But it is noteworthy that the ratio of Co2C to Co slightly decreases when further increases GO content to 6 wt.%, which needs further discussion below. Moreover, the grain size of Co2C and metallic Co calculated by Scherrer formula are listed in Table 1. No significant increase in the particle size can be observed, which demonstrates that Co species don’t aggregate during carbonization process, consistently with the TEM images. Furthermore, XPS was measured to verify the surface compositions of carbonized Co/xGO-OMS catalysts (Fig. 6 ). The binding energy of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 for carbonized catalysts show peaks at 778.2 and 793.3 eV, respectively, which assigned to metallic Co. [33] The Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 binding energy located at 782 and 798 eV correspond to Co2+. And the appearance of two satellite peaks at 787.5 and 803.7 eV in the Co 2p spectra further confirms the existence of Co2+ species. [34,35] Assuming that Co2+ ions and Co0 atoms have the same surface area and identical atomic sensitivity factors, the surface molar ratio of Co2+ to Co can be estimated by calculating the ratio of fitted peak areas of Co2+ and Co. As shown in Table S2, the surface ratio of Co2+ to Co increases from 1.36 to 1.80 with GO content increasing from 0 to 3 wt.%. When GO is further added to 6 wt.%, the ratio slightly drops to 1.65. According to the calculated results of H2-TPR profiles (given in Table S1), all of catalysts show a similar low content of CoO species existing in catalysts. Combined with the XRD and TEM results of carbonized catalysts, it is demonstrated that the variation of Co2+ species could be dominantly attributed to Co2C. Moreover, the C 1s spectra of carbonized Co/xGO-OMS catalysts are shown in Fig. S6. The dominant peak centered at 284.5 eV corresponds to CC bonds, which originates from the carbon material support. [16] The shoulder peak located at 283.3 eV is assigned to carbide species [33,36]. However, the peak of carbide species is relatively weak due to the influence of large amounts of CC bonds existing in GO support [37]. As shown in Fig. S6, the C1 s peak of Co/xGO-OMS shifts to low binding energy, due to the generation of cobalt carbide. And the shifting trend is consistent with the surface ratio of Co2+ to Co obtained by Co 2p spectra, which further confirms that Co2+ species should be assigned to Co2C. Based on the above analysis, it is indicated that addition of GO could influence the formation process of Co2C, thus different ratios of Co-Co2C dual sites are obtained. As shown in Fig. 7 , the ratio of Co2C to Co obtained from XPS presents a volcanic curve with the increase of GO content, which is consistent with XRD results. It is worthy to notice that the surface ratio of Co2C to Co is slightly higher than bulk ratio, which is mainly because Co2C are more inclined to form surface species during carbonization. [36]"
10,Effect of GO on catalytic performance,"3.4 Effect of GO on catalytic performance The catalytic performance of HAS over Co/xGO-OMS catalysts is shown in Table 2 . Each catalyst was tested twice under the same reaction conditions to make sure the reliability of the results. As shown in Table S4, both CO conversion and products selectivity were similar for each test with a low relative deviation, indicating that the measuring results were reproducible and reliable. Co/xGO-OMS catalysts exhibited promising catalytic performance under comparable low reaction temperature at GHSV as high as 10,800 mL/(gcat·h). We can find that only a minor amount of CO2 produced, which is due to the low water-gas shift (WGS) activity of cobalt-based catalysts. [38,39] With increasing GO content from 0 to 3 wt.%, the total alcohol selectivity significantly increases and the maximum value reaches 43.3% for Co/3GO-OMS. When GO content is further added to 6 wt.%, the selectivity to alcohols drops slightly from 43.3% to 40.7%. Moreover, to further discuss the effect of GO on alcohols selectivity, the Co/xGO-OMS catalysts were tested at different GHSV to get a similar CO conversion [40] (Table 3 ). It is worthy to point out that the alcohols selectivity obtained at the same CO conversion level exhibits a good linear correlation with the surface ratio of Co2C to Co (shown in Fig. 8 ), which demonstrates that Co2C species play an important role in the formation of alcohols. To further discuss the role of Co2C, the reduced Co/3GO-OMS without carbonization pretreatment was characterized and tested under the same reaction conditions. As shown in the XRD patterns of reduced and carbonized catalyst (Fig. S7), the reduced Co/3GO-OMS is a carbide-free sample, while metallic cobalt and Co2C exist simultaneously in the carbonized Co/3GO-OMS sample. The catalytic performances of HAS over reduced and carbonized Co/3GO-OMS catalysts are shown in Table S3. Due to the strong CO dissociation and carbon chain growth ability of metallic Co, a high CO conversion and a large amount of long-chain paraffin hydrocarbons produced over the reduced Co/3GO-OMS catalyst without carbonization, which is consisted with the literature reported result [29]. The total alcohol selectivity is as low as 9.4%. As for the carbonized Co/3GO-OMS catalyst, the alcohol selectivity is significantly increased to 43.3%, which could be attributed to the presence of Co2C that enhances CO non-dissociated adsorption, reduces the formation of hydrocarbons and weakens the carbon-chain growth ability. In addition, the XRD patterns of the Co/3GO-OMS catalysts before and after 24 h reaction are compared in Fig. S8. There are no obvious phase changes happened of both samples during the 24 h reaction. For the reduced Co/3GO-OMS catalyst, the phase of metallic cobalt was observed in both samples before and after 24 h reaction and there was no obvious Co2C phase detected after 24 h reaction. As for the carbonized Co/3GO-OMS catalyst, the diffraction peak at 44.2° is assigned to metallic Co, and the peaks at 2θ of 41.5°, 42.7° and 45.7°demonstrate the existence of Co2C species. There is no obvious variation of crystalline structure after 24 h reaction. Thus, the catalytic performance difference between the reduced and carbonized Co/3GO-OMS catalysts demonstrated the significant role of Co2C in the formation of alcohols. Additionally, here the alcohol distribution doesn’t change significantly. A similar result was reported by Liu and coworkers [41], who suggested that it may be because of the close contact between Co and Co2C active sites. Based on the above observations, it is deduced that the addition of GO influences the ratio of Co and Co2C dual sites, which further influences the alcohol selectivity. It is reported that the HAS reaction mechanism includes the following process [32]: (1) the dissociative adsorption of CO and H2, (2) the hydrogenation of C* leading to the formation of surface CHx, (3) the non-dissociative adsorption of CO, (4) the insertion of undissociated CO/CHxO* to surface H*/CHx * leading to the generation of oxygenates. Thus more non-dissociative CO insertion sites would be more favorable for the production of alcohols. And the hydrogenation and coupling of CHx * results in the formation of methane and other long chain hydrocarbons. Based on the previous research about the mechanism of HAS [14,16], Co2+ species were proposed to be responsible for CO associative adsorption and CO insertion, which was crucial for HAS. In this work, the XRD and XPS results of carbonized Co/xGO-OMS catalysts demonstrated that a variation of the relative ratio of Co2+ to Co0 could be obtained by adjusting the content of GO. Surface CHx * may be formed on Co0 sites and then interact with CHx * and H* to form hydrocarbons. Meanwhile, CO may be molecularly adsorb on Co2+ species and then coupled with CHx * and H* to form oxygenates. A high content of Co2+ over Co/xGO-OMS facilitated the non-dissociative adsorption of CO and CO insertion process, leading to an increased selectivity to alcohols. GO addition not only increases the higher alcohol selectivity but also improves the catalytic activity for CO conversion. As shown in Table 2, the CO conversion increases from 20.1% to 35.4% with GO content increasing from 0 to 3 wt.%. As proved by BET, XRD and TEM results, catalyst with a larger surface area and smaller cobalt particle size can be achieved by the addition of GO. And the defects on GO sheets may also serve as anchored sites of Co nanoparticles, which leads to a higher dispersion. However, CO conversion decreases to 19.4% when increasing GO to 6 wt.%. To further explore the reason that catalytic activity decreased, CO chemisorption was conducted. As shown in Table S5, the dispersion of Co nanoparticles shows a volcanic curve with the increasing GO addition. This trend is consistent with the results that Co/3GO-OMS reaches the highest catalytic activity among different GO additions. The accessible surface area of cobalt species decreases when 6 wt.% GO is introduced. It can be deduced that a part of cobalt active sites are probably enveloped by the GO wrinkle sheets when an excess of GO is introduced, leading to the decrease of availably exposed Co active sites, the catalytic activity thus decreases. The similar restack of graphene sheets also occurred in its application in Li-ion batteries [42,43]. The stability tests of the Co/OMS and Co/3GO-OMS catalysts were investigated for a 108 h’s reaction (Fig. 9 ). For Co/OMS catalyst, the CO conversion showed a visible decrease from 48 h. The selectivity of undesired CO2 and hydrocarbon significantly increased during reaction, resulting in a continuous decrease of alcohol selectivity. As for Co/3GO-OMS catalyst, there is not a visible decrease of catalytic performance before 60 h’s reaction. Obviously, the Co/3GO-OMS exhibits an enhanced catalytic stability compared to Co/OMS catalyst. XRD was further measured to analyze the crystalline structure and particle size of the catalysts after 108 h reaction. As shown in Fig. S9, the diffraction peak at 2θ of 44.2° is assigned to Cofcc (JCPDS 15-0806) and the peaks at 2θ of 41.5°, 42.7° and 45.7° correspond to Co2C phase (JCPDS 05-0704). It can be observed that metallic Co and Co2C existed simultaneously in carbonized catalysts. After 108 h’s reaction, new peaks corresponding to the Cohcp diffraction peaks (2θ = 41.7 and 47.6°) appeared, which was due to the decomposition of Co2C [44]. Although the decomposition of Co2C into Cohcp is found in both Co/OMS and Co/3GO-OMS catalyst, some of Co2C could still be detected in the used Co/3GO-OMS catalyst. In addition, the size of Co particle calculated by Scherrer formula are shown in Table S6. A more significant particle growth can be observed over Co/OMS catalyst. Thus, the addition of GO could slow the decomposition of Co2C and prevent the growth of cobalt to a certain degree, which leads to an enhanced catalytic stability compared to Co/OMS."
11,Mechanism of GO effect,"3.5 Mechanism of GO effect According to the results obtained above, apart from the promotion of cobalt dispersion, the addition of GO also influenced the distribution of Co-Co2C active species, which might originate from the GO effect on carbide formation process. Recent attempts have been made to analyze the formation of metal carbide supported on nanocarbon materials. [18,45,46] However, few research mentioned the influencing mechanism of carbon materials. The graphitization degree played an important role in the fundamental study of graphitic materials, in particular providing valuable information about surface defects and sintering resistance. [47,48] To explore the effect of different graphitization degree on the surface properties, Raman characterization was measured. As shown in Fig. S10, the Raman spectra of xGO-OMS supports exhibit the characteristic D band (1337 cm−1) and G band (1585 cm−1) with a D-to-G intensity ratio of about 1.30, indicating a relatively similar graphitization of all supports [49]. Thus, the influence of different graphitization degree could be excluded. To establish the relationship between carbon materials and carbide sites, Zeta potential characterization and in situ DRIFTS of carbonization process were further applied in this study. The zeta potential is defined as electrical potential between the aqueous solution and the surface charges, which is widely used to characterize the surface charge of carbon materials. [50,51] As presented in Table 4 , the surface of xGO-OMS supports is negatively charged. The negatively charged GO could serve as an electron donor to cobalt species, and the electron donor effect is related to the amount of negative surface charge. [52] The zeta potential value shows an increase with GO is added from 0 to 3 wt.%, which demonstrates a stronger electron donor effect is obtained by increasing GO contents. But the value of zeta potential slightly decreases when further increasing GO addition, resulting in a weakened electron donor effect. This is mainly because of the inhomogeneous charge distribution caused by severe stacks of GO sheets [53]. Moreover, in situ DRIFTS of CO adsorption was further measured to verify the electron donor effect of GO on cobalt carbonization. The in situ DRIFTS spectra of reduced catalysts were recorded at reaction temperature after 30 min of CO adsorption. As shown in Fig. 10 , the bands at 2175 cm−1 and 2115 cm−1 are attributed to the rotational and vibrational transitions of gaseous CO [54]. Additionally, the bands between 2100 and 1990 cm−1 are assigned to the stretching vibrations of CO linearly adsorbed on metallic Co species [55]. It is obviously that this peak shifts to lower wavenumbers with the addition of GO. It has been reported that dissociation of CO bond was strongly related to the strength of metal-carbon bond [56]. In Co/xGO-OMS catalysts, GO serves as the electron donor to cobalt, which would strengthen the π back bonding from Co0 to absorbed CO. The strong Co0 CO bond hence weakens the CO triple bond, resulting in a decrease of CO stretching frequency. [23] In this way, the weakened CO bond could favor the carbon deposition on metallic cobalt during CO carbonization, thereby promoting the formation of carbide species [57]. The similar electronic donor effect was reported in alkali metals additives, which act as the promoter to enhance the CO adsorption and dissociation of Co species, facilitating the formation of the Co2C phase. [23] While further increasing GO contents, the stacks of GO result in different electronic properties [58], hence weaken the electron donor effect and decease the formation of carbide species. As mentioned earlier, GO has been proved to be helpful in Co dispersion. Additionally, GO sheets can act as the electron donor to cobalt, which leads to a stronger CO adsorption and promotes CO disassociation, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity. However, severe stacks would weaken the electron donor effect, resulting in slightly low activity."
12,Conclusion,"A series of GO-OMS composite supported cobalt-based catalysts were successfully prepared and applied to HAS. The alcohol selectivity and catalytic activity significantly increased with the increase of GO contents at beginning, and the maximum C2+OH yield was obtained over Co/3GO-OMS. It was found that not only the addition of GO improved metal dispersion, but also GO acted as an electron donor to promote CO adsorption and disassociation on Co species, both leading to a higher catalytic activity. The electron donor effect of GO was reflected in the carbide formation process as well. The increased ratio of Co2C/Co with GO addition remarkably enhanced the selectivity of alcohols in HAS. However, when further increased GO addition, the stacks of GO would cover a part of active sites and weaken the electron donor effect, resulting in a lower C2+OH yield. The use of carbon-silica composite support could be a promising route to affect the carbonization of cobalt, leading a flexible adjustment of synergistic effect between metallic cobalt site and Co2C site. These insights into the role of carbon materials in CO hydrogenation reactions and metal carbonization process may lead new possibilities in rational design of efficient catalysts."
