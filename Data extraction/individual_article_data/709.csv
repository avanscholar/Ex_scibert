0,Introduction,"Mixed alcohols synthesis from coal or natural gas via syngas has been attracting researchers’ interest due to their potential application as a good gasoline blend or alternative motor fuel for the reduction of exhaust emission in the past 30 years [1–3]. Among those catalysts systems available for mixed alcohols synthesis, Cu-based catalyst containing metal active towards Fischer–Tropsch (F–T) synthesis (Fe, Co or Ni), such as Cu–Co based catalyst, was considered as one of the most promising catalysts. However, the report associated with Cu–Co based catalyst for large scale industrial application, to our best knowledge, is not available due to the poor stabilization with long-term run and the low total alcohol selectivity from the practical point of view although the related catalysts have also been published by some authors more recently [4–8]. The catalysts systems which replaced Co by other F–T synthesis catalysts (such as Fe, Ni) were also investigated by some researchers. Sibillia et al. [9] found the addition of Fe to Cu/ZnO methanol synthesis catalysts led to a significant improvement of hydrocarbons. Uchiyama et al. [10] reported a copper and sodium added NiO–TiO2 catalyst, producing about 50wt.% C2+OH in total alcohols. Unfortunately, the serious methanation was also observed. Thus, both activity and selectivity have been still the major obstacles for the further development. Recently, an efficient Fe-modified CuMnZrO2 catalyst has been developed at our lab [11]. The introduction of Fe into CuMnZrO2 catalyst led to a rise of the interaction between copper and iron and then promoted chain growth to form higher alcohols. However, Fe modified CuMnZrO2 catalyst still suffered from the poor selectivity to C2+OH and severe operation conditions due to the strong interaction of iron oxide with support. Thus, the effect of zinc and manganese promoters, along with pretreatment atmospheres (H2, syngas or CO), was investigated to optimize the overall catalytic performance in the present work."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Cu–Fe catalysts with or without promoter were prepared by conventional co-precipitation method. Typically, a mixture of copper, iron and related metallic (zinc and/or manganese) nitrates was precipitated with an aqueous solution of NH3 ·H2O at 70°C and a constant pH of 7–8 in a well-stirred thermo-stated container. After aging for 2h, the precipitate was washed thoroughly with distilled water, and was dried at 120°C for 12h and then calcined at 450°C in air for 3h. In all cases, each metallic component was added with equal atom ratio."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization BET surface area of Cu–Fe catalysts were determined by N2 adsorption at −196°C using ASAP-2000 Micromeritics instrument, and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the catalysts were recorded on a Bruker D8 advanced diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation."
4,Catalyst pretreatment and testing,"2.3 Catalyst pretreatment and testing Before testing, the calcined catalysts were activated in syngas with the H2/CO of 2.0 at ambient pressure with a designed temperature-programmed procedure, which was employed as followed: RT→120°C in 0.5h and keeping for 1h; 120°C→240°C in 1h and for 2h; 240°C→300°C in 1h and for 12h. A steady gas flow rate of 60mL/min was maintained through the whole activation process. Also, CuZnFeMn catalyst activated in H2 or CO was also examined in order to probe the effect of pretreatment atmosphere with identical procedure above. The catalytic performance testing was conducted with a fixed-bed, stainless flow micro-reactor. After on-line activation described above and cooling to room temperature, syngas was introduced into reactor, followed by a rise of reaction temperature with a rate of 2°C/min. All synthesis reaction was employed at 240°C, 4.0MPa, and 6000h−1 with the H2/CO of 2.0 in feed gas apart from CuZnFeMn catalyst, whose performance was tested with different temperatures, varying from 220°C to 280°C with a gradient of 20°C. The steady-state activity measurements were taken after at least 24h on the stream. Both gaseous and liquid products were analyzed off-line by gas chromatographs. H2, CO, CH4 and CO2 were determined by thermal conductivity detector (TCD) with a TDX-101 column. The water and methanol in liquids were also detected by TCD with a GDX-401 column. The alcohols were analyzed by flame ionization detector (FID) with a Porapack-Q column and oil and wax were analyzed in OV-101 capillary columns. The carbon balance and mass balance were 100±5%."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Physic-chemical properties and catalytic performance,"3.1 Physic-chemical properties and catalytic performance As given in Table 1 , zinc and manganese co-promoted Cu–Fe catalyst had a surface area of 125.9m2/g with the average pore size of 10.3nm and the pore volume of 0.32cm3/g, and the diffraction peaks in XRD patterns could be ascribed to the presence of ZnFe2O4 in calcined catalyst (see Fig. 1 and Table 1). Li et al. [12] also observed the same phase over Fe2O3–Zn–K–Cu F–T synthesis catalysts. They proposed that ZnFe2O4 inhibited the sintering of Fe oxide phases at low Zn contents and provided a matrix for the isolation of Fe2O3 at high Zn contents, leading to an increase in surface area after thermal treatment and activation in synthesis gas. The overall performance of CuZnFeMn catalyst with syngas pretreatment for mixed alcohols synthesis appeared as a function of temperature (see Tables 2 and 3 ). From Table 2, it can be seen that the alcohol yield was fairly high even at a relatively mild condition, i.e. 0.20g/mLh (amounting to approximately 140g/kgh with the bulk density of 1.3–1.4g/mL) of total alcohols at 240°C, which was comparable to the results over Cu–Co catalysts [1] and much higher than other modified Cu–Fe catalysts [9,10]. Kiennemann et al. [13] reported a Fe–Cu–Mo–U catalyst with the production of C1–C6 linear alcohols up to 100g/kgh at 280°C and 8.5MPa. In all cases, a little amount of other oxygenates, less than 5wt.% in liquid products, including aldehydes, ketones, esters and ethers were also detected. The product distributions are listed in Table 3. The alcohol products were comprised of C1–C6 linear mixed alcohols as expected. Moreover, the C2+OH selectivity was over 40% in total alcohols at the temperature of as low as 220°C and reached 53.88% at 280°C, although it was probably slightly lower than that of Cu–Co catalysts as reviewed by Xu et al. [1]. Similar to Cu–Co catalyst, the carbon number distributions of either alcohols or hydrocarbons over this Cu–Fe based catalyst followed excellently Anderson–Schulz–Flory (A–S–F) plots (logarithm of mole fraction vs. carbon number) (not shown). In addition, the hydrocarbons were mainly composed of C2–C4 olefins and C5–C11 alkanes, and the CH4 selectivity was relatively lower compared with Cu–Co or other Cu–Fe based catalysts. Thus, the present CuZnFeMn catalyst could be considered as a potential candidate for the combined production of mixed alcohols and gasoline. The change trends of chain growth probability (α parameter) for alcohols and hydrocarbons with reaction temperature, calculated on the basis of A–S–F distribution function, are presented in Fig. 2 . Unlike Cu–Co catalysts, over which the α parameters, for both alcohols and hydrocarbons appeared in parallel [14], the Cu–Fe based catalyst showed different α parameters for two products. Such an obvious discrepancy should be due to the bulk compositions in two catalyst systems, and unequal α parameters between F–T synthesis and mixed alcohols synthesis indicated that alcohol and hydrocarbon did not derived from the same intermediates. Over Cu–Co based catalysts, a chain growth mechanism that adsorbed CO moved to an adsorbed alkyl group and inserted between metal sites and the alkyl group was generally accepted [14]. Thus, there should be something different from Cu–Co catalysts, whose attribute will be identified in Section 3.3, located at the interface between Cu and Fe. As shown in Fig. 2, the α parameter of alcohols reached a plateau after experiencing the initial increase in 220–240°C range. However, it is well known that appropriately increasing temperature will be favorable to C2+OH selectivity since possible equilibrium of methanol synthesis is reached. This unexpected finding supported the unlike observation between Cu–Co catalyst and the present Cu–Fe based catalyst. As for hydrocarbon products, it was noted that the α parameter generally shows a monotonous decrease with the increasing reaction temperature. The present observation might be again indicative of the difference between Cu–Co based catalyst and Cu–Fe based catalyst, the detailed discussion of which is presented below."
7,Role of zinc and manganese in the catalyst,"3.2 Role of zinc and manganese in the catalyst The catalytic performance of model catalysts with or without promoter was also tested to investigate their promotional effect upon CuFe catalyst (see Table 4 ). CuFe catalyst showed the reaction behavior of F–T synthesis rather than mixed alcohols synthesis stemmed from the strong activation tendency of iron towards CO in dissociative mode. The addition of zinc oxide into CuFe catalyst changed evidently the performance for CO hydrogenation, in which a drastic increase in CO conversion and a decrease in C2+OH selectivity were observed clearly. The higher CO conversion was not obviously associated with the aspect of BET surface area since it was decreased greatly after zinc addition as listed in Table 1, but rather to the stabilization effect of zinc oxide towards iron due to the formation of ZnFe2O4 as proposed by other authors [12]. And, a lower C2+OH selectivity might be caused by the weakening synergistic effect between copper and iron due to lower dispersion of them judging from smaller BET surface area and more pronounced phases (for example, the emergence of the strong peaks due to CuO, ZnO and ZnFe2O4) detected by XRD in Table 1 by comparing with CuFe catalyst. Contrarily, manganese promoted CuFe catalyst hardly improved the CO conversion, even less than unpromoted CuFe catalyst. Nevertheless, the larger BET surface area, given in Table 1 and the better dispersion of Cu and Fe, disclosed by our previous study [15], promoted the synergistic effect between copper and iron, leading to the higher selectivity to total alcohols despite a decrease in C2+OH selectivity derived from its dilution effect. Based on these observations, it was suggested that zinc and manganese promoted CuFe catalyst in different manner. Zinc oxide could be considered to be an electronic/chemical promoter whereas manganese was a structural promoter. Thus, the obvious synergistic effect of zinc and manganese existed over co-promoted CuFe catalyst, which led to a change in overall catalytic performance as listed in Tables 2 and 3. As far as CO2 was concerned, it was well known that copper and iron compounds were active towards water–gas shift (WGS) reaction. Kubur et al. [16] proposed that one measure of the WGS activity was the CO2 selectivity defined as the rate of CO2 production divided by the total rate of CO consumption (or the percentage of CO converted to CO2) assuming that all the CO2 was produced by the WGS reaction. The CO2 selectivity of catalysts in total carbon basis is shown in Table 4. In the trinary catalysts, either zinc or manganese showed no distinct effect on the increase in the rates of WGS reaction. However, the same synergistic effect between zinc and manganese led to a significant decrease in CO2 selectivity, displaying only 10.44% at 240°C (see Table 2)."
8,Effect of pretreatment atmosphere on the performance,"3.3 Effect of pretreatment atmosphere on the performance A comparison in the effect of different atmospheres on the Cu–Fe based catalyst was made and the results are presented in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 . H2 activation resulted in the lowest CO conversion and then the lowest yield of alcohols and hydrocarbons, but syngas and CO pretreatments showed the nearly similar performance, displaying a better result. It was well known that H2 activation led to the formation of magnetite and metallic iron, whereas syngas and CO activations gave rise to the formation of iron carbides and magnetite [17]. This indicated that the formation of iron carbides was indispensable for the production of alcohols. In addition, the relative contents of total alcohols and hydrocarbons selectivity calculated on the basis of CO2-free result were 1:1.39, 1:1.46 and 1:1.48 for H2, syngas and CO-pretreated catalysts, respectively, indicating invariable values approximately. This possibly suggested that the pretreatments played a slight or neglectable role in the mechanism of alcohols synthesis. As mentioned in Section 3.1, the mixed products over CuZnFeMn catalyst under syngas pretreatment followed well A–S–F distributions. The α parameters was not equal basically between alcohols and hydrocarbons. Moreover, the change trend of the α parameters for alcohols and hydrocarbons with pretreatment atmosphere was also different as seen in Fig. 4, indicating different manner of carbon chain growth upon the Cu–Fe based catalyst. As for the production of hydrocarbon, the change trend in α parameter as a function of pretreatment atmosphere indeed indicated that its chain growth was affected directly by the buildup content of graphitic carbon. Dry [18] pointed out that the rate of carbon deposition was directly proportional to the factor of P CO / P H 2 2 under H2/CO atmosphere. Thus, it could be expected that the carbon content would increased with the rise of CO partial pressure from H2 to syngas, and to CO. Similarly, the reverse change trend between α parameter of hydrocarbon and reaction temperature after syngas pretreatment as discussed above could be the same reason. And something, different from Cu–Co catalysts and located at the interface between Cu and Fe, must be graphite-type inactive carbon. In the case of the production of alcohol, the α parameter went through a maximum among catalysts studied. The lowest α value in H2-activated catalyst suggested its inability to propagate carbon chain due to the absence of iron carbides. However, CO-pretreated catalyst showed lower α value in comparison to syngas-pretreated one even if their nearly identical activities. A possible explanation was that the intimate contact between Cu and Fe would be strongly weakened by blocking the interface of Cu and Fe due to severe buildup of graphitic carbon over CO-pretreated catalyst. This led to the weakening interaction between Cu and Fe and then low yield of C2+OH. Based on this, it was understandable that the α parameter of alcohols reached a plateau after experiencing the initial increase in 220–240°C range as described in Section 3.1. As a result, a rise in reaction temperature was favorable to the production of C2+OH. On the other hand, the carbon content, proportional to reaction temperature, resulted in the weaker synergistic effect between copper and iron. Accordingly, the α parameter would stay nearly unchanged when a equilibrium between this two influencing factors reached. In summary, a promising catalyst for mixed alcohols synthesis combined production of gasoline was developed at fairly moderate reaction condition with the activity and selectivity of more than 0.20g/mLh and 50%, respectively, and further investigation in the overall performance improvement is now in progress."
9,Conclusion,"The production of alcohols or hydrocarbons over zinc, manganese co-modified Cu–Fe catalyst followed A–S–F distributions. Unlike Cu–Co catalysts, α parameters for both alcohols and hydrocarbons were essentially different due to the impact of free carbon deposited on the surface of catalyst. The obvious synergistic effect of zinc and manganese was observed over co-modified CuFe catalyst, which led to a rise in the overall performance. The formation of iron carbides was indispensable for the production of mixed alcohols. Thus, the catalyst activated under syngas showed better activity to alcohols and selectivity to C2+OH than that under H2 or CO."
