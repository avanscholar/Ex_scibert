0,Introduction,"Seafood is nutritious and one of the fastest animal sources of food in the world. Seafood is reported to be high in quality protein, omega-3 fatty acids, essential micronutrients and minerals (Goulas, Chouliara, Nessi, Kontominas, & Savvaidis, 2005; Iwamoto, Ayers, Mahon, & Swerdlow, 2010). Similarly, it is also source of income to both developing and developed coastal countries (Sudha, Divya, Francis, & Hatha, 2012). Iwamoto et al. (2010) described seafood to include shellfish (molluscs, crustaceans) and finfish. Seafood serve as source of nutrients required in balanced diet (Sirot, Dumas, Leblanc, & Margaritis, 2011; Wang, Li, & Li, 2014). Health benefits of seafood consumption includes reduction of risk of heart diseases (Kris-Etherton, Harris, Appel, & Committee, 2002; Mozaffarian & Rimm, 2006) and development of neurons during gestation and at infancy (Daniels, Longnecker, Rowland, & Golding, 2004; Fewtrell et al., 2004; Iwamoto et al., 2010). Subsequent contamination of seafood may occur in various stages like processing, storage and distribution of seafood. Sources of contamination include water, facilities, equipment and handlers. The processing stage is particularly important, due to potential high microbial load on the surface. The number of microorganisms present in the product determines whether the contamination will cause microbial deterioration or disease (Zwietering, de Koos, Hasenack, de Witt, & van't Riet, 1991). The rate of spoilage of seafood is affected by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as composition of the seafood, water activity, packaging method and storage temperature (Cayre, Vignolo, & Garro, 2003). Seafood quality depends on causes of deterioration among other factors. Seafood spoilage could be autolytic, chemical or microbial. Diverse microbiota is observed in seafood. Only few of these bacteria known as specific spoilage organisms (SSO) cause spoilage. Understanding spoilage mechanism will help maintain its quality and extend shelf-life of seafood. Spoilage of seafood could be as a result of microbial activities, autolysis or chemical oxidation (Gram & Huss, 1996). While seafood indigenous enzymes are responsible for autolysis, microbial activities of specific spoilage organisms result into spoilage of seafood more often than chemical oxidation or autolysis (Parlapani, Mallouchos, Haroutounian, & Boziaris, 2014). Specific spoilage organisms (SSOs) produce off flavours, off odour metabolites and dominate microbiota of seafood (Olafsdóttir et al., 1997). These spoilage organisms are mainly Gram negative bacteria (Herbert, Hendrie, Gibson, & Shewan, 1971). The off odour produced includes hydrogen sulphide, trimethylamine (TMA) and biogenic amines due to amino acid decarboxylation activity (Ge, Zhu, Ye, & Yang, 2017). They also produce enzymes such as DNase, lipase and protease. These spoilage markers reduce consumers' acceptability, seafood palatability and shelf-life. Off flavours and off odour metabolites produced are collectively known as volatile compounds. These metabolites are broadly grouped into sulphur compounds, alcohol, amines, aldehydes, esters and organic acids and ketones often produced during seafood spoilage (Shewan & Murray, 1979). Volatile organic compounds (VOC) used as seafood spoilage indicators are characterised by initial absence or presence in low levels in seafood, majorly produced by dominant spoilage bacteria increase with spoilage microbial succession and sensory evaluation, and increase over storage period (Jay, 1986). It is however, important to monitor VOC profile during storage period and record order of appearance from first day of storage to end of shelf-life (Parlapani et al., 2014). Volatile organic compounds used as seafood spoilage indicator depends majorly on storage conditions which could be air, vacuum or modified atmosphere, state of sample (raw, smoked, cooked or fermented) and dominant spoilage bacteria (Miks-Krajnik, Yoon, Ukuku, & Yuk, 2016). Although various studies on microbial quality of mussels (cooked and raw) have been carried, to the best of our knowledge, no study investigating the spoilage potential and volatile metabolites produced by spoilage bacteria isolated from modified atmosphere packaged live mussels have been carried out. This study therefore aimed to evaluate specific spoilage bacteria isolated from modified atmosphere packaged live mussels for microbial spoilage indices and spoilage volatile metabolites."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Source of bacteria - isolation,"2.1 Source of bacteria - isolation Samples of live freshly harvested mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were obtained from commercial farm at East coast Tasmania, Australia. Samples were transported into the lab in iced Styrofoam box. Mussels were sorted, cleaned and depurated in saltwater for 4–12h. Modified atmosphere packaging of 8–10 mussels was carried out at 80% headspace oxygen with 50mL sterile fresh water added to provide humid condition for the mussels. Samples were stored at 4°C for 15days. Microbiological analysis was carried out on day 0, 4, 7, 10 and 15. On each sampling day, 10g of mussel meat and pouch water was added to 90mL of alkaline peptone water containing bacteriological peptone 10g (Code LP003T, Oxoid, UK) and 20g NaCl (Code 0314B92, Amcresco, USA). This was then homogenized in stomacher (Stomacher Lab Blender 400, Australia) for 1min before serially diluting 1mL of the homogenate in 9mL of 0.1% alkaline peptone water was carried out. Thereafter, 10μL of decimal dilutions (100–105) from each mussel sample and pouch water was spread. Bacteria were isolated from both mussel meat and pouch water using Iron agar (bacteriological peptone 20g – Code LP0037, Oxoid, UK), Lab lemco powder 3g (Code L29, Oxoid, UK), yeast extract 3g (Code LP0021, Oxoid, UK), ferric citrate 0.3g (Code 28381, BDH, UK), sodium thiosulphate 0.3g (Code 517, Ajax Chemicals, Australia), cysteine 0.6g (Code 37055, BDH, UK), NaCl 5g (Code 0314B92, Amcresco, USA) and agar 15g (Code LP0011,Oxoid, UK). Black pigmented colonies on Iron agar were selected randomly based on their colony morphology as described by Makino et al. (2010). Isolates were further purified (Fig. 1 ) on Tryptone soy agar - TSA (Code CM0131, Oxoid, UK) before re-culturing in Iron agar to confirm production of black pigment due to oxidation of Iron sulphide (FeS) because of utilization of cysteine and thiosulphate (Makino et al., 2010; Romalde, Diéguez, Lasa, & Balboa, 2014). Stock cultures were prepared from the isolates and preserved at −80°C while the working cultures were continuously used in this study."
3,Biochemical identification,"2.2 Biochemical identification Selected biochemical tests as described in Bergey's manual, Beaz-Hidalgo, Agueria, Latif-Eugenin, Yeannes, and Figueras (2015), Dehaut, Midelet-Bourdin, Brisabois, and Duflos (2014), Deng et al. (2014) and Dileep et al. (2003) were used for phenotypic characterization of H2S producing isolates. Stock cultures of the isolates were subcultured from Iron agar unto freshly prepared TSA and incubated at 25°C overnight. Isolates were Gram stained, tested for catalase and oxidase reactions. Thereafter, isolates were re cultured on Iron agar to reconfirm black pigment. Similarly, isolate cultured on DNase agar (CM0321, Oxoid, UK), Kligler iron agar (CM 0033, Oxoid, UK). Carbon utilization (glucose, d-sorbitol, l-arabinose, and lactose) and amino acids assimilation (arginine, lysine and ornithine) were tested. API 20 E (Code 20160, Biomeriuex, France) and Microbact 24E (Code 1404973, Oxoid, UK) were also used for biochemical identification. Salt tolerance (0–10%) and growth at varying temperatures (4–37°C) were also investigated."
4,Physiological characterization,"2.3 Physiological characterization 2.3.1 H2S production on sulphur containing agar Isolates were screened for production of H2S on different Iron agar prepared as follows: IA1 with the above components: IA2 (only cysteine added), IA3 (only sodium thiosulphate added) and Kligler Iron agar (KIA). Isolates were inoculated on freshly prepared sterile agar and incubated at 25°C for 24h. Production of H2S on the agar after 24h incubation was designated positive (Nespolo, Martineli, & Jr, 2012). 2.3.2 Salt tolerance Salt tolerance among the isolates was investigated. The following concentration of salt (NaCl) was added to Iron agar: 1.5%, 3%, 4.5%, 6% and 10% before autoclaving at 121°C for 15min. After cooling the agar to 45°C, agar was poured into plates and allowed to solidify. Thereafter, 24h cultures of the isolates were inoculated into each of the plates and incubated at 25°C for 24–72h. Plates were observed on each day for visible growth and colony formation. Isolates that could not grow after 72h were regarded as non - viable. 2.3.3 Ability to growth at different temperatures Isolates were tested for ability to grow at different temperatures using TSA agar. Fresh cultures (18–24h) of the isolates were inoculated into freshly prepared TSA. Plates were incubated at 4°C, 25°C and 37°C for 24h (25°C and 37°C) and 72h (4°C). 2.3.4 Proteolytic activity Therefore, both enzymatic activities were examined in this study. Proteolytic activity of all the isolates was carried out using skim agar. Skim milk - 99.9% fat free (Devondale, Murray Goulburn Ltd., Australia was added to nutrient agar (Code CM 0001, Oxoid, UK). The nutrient agar was prepared by adding 800mL of distilled water to 23g agar. This was autoclaved and was cool to 45°C before adding skim milk (200mL). Overnight cultures of the isolates were then spot inoculated unto the plates and incubated at 25°C for 72h. Plates were observed for clear zone after 24, 48 and 72h. Zone of clearance was obtained based on below: Zone of clearance = Total diameter of zone of clearance − diameter of colony Diameter of colony 2.3.5 Lipolytic activity The ability of the isolates to degrade lipids was investigated through use of Tween 80 (Code 1603215643, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Australia). Nutrient agar was prepared as above with Tween 80 added instead of skim milk and autoclaved at 121°C for 15min. Thereafter, after pouring into petri dishes and allowed to solidify, 10μL of overnight broth culture of the isolates was used to inoculate the plates. Plates were incubated as above and observed for clear zone. 2.3.6 DNase DNase agar prepared according to manufacturer's instruction was used to investigate DNase production (J.J. Wang et al., 2014). Methyl green was added to serve as indicator of zone of clearance."
5,Spoilage potential,"2.4 Spoilage potential 2.4.1 Preparation of inoculum Isolates were inoculated into sterile TSA-YE+6% NaCl agar and incubated overnight. Thereafter, a sterile loop was used to touch the surface of the colonies and inoculated into freshly prepared 1mL NB in cell culture plates before incubating at 25°C for 24h. Cooked mussel juice was inoculated with 20μL and 10μL of the prepared inoculum in cooked mussel juice agar. 2.4.2 Preparation of medium A - cooked mussel juice and medium B - cooked mussel juice agar Media A and B were prepared following modified methods of Makino et al. (2010) and Polo, Feal, Varela, Monteagudo, and Romalde (2014). Freshly harvested blue mussels (M. galloprovincialis) obtained from mussel farmer in East coast Tasmania, Australia were used in making mussel juice agar. Mussels were shucked with sterile shucking knife while 100g of mussel meat (gut excluded) was weighed and added to 400mL of commercially sold chemical free water (Pureau, Australia) and homogenized for 60s. This was further divided into part A and B each containing 50g of mussel in 200mL of chemical free water. The homogenates were sieved to remove mussel flesh while 300mL of chemical free water was added to each part before autoclaving at 121°C for 15min. The autoclaved mussel juice (broth/slurry) was then allowed to cool at room temperature to allow mussel meat debris to settle and then decanted into another sterile. Thereafter, 7.5g of bacteriological agar was prepared with 100mL of chemical free water and autoclave as above. The prepared sterile agar was allowed to cool to 45°C before adding mussel juice part A while part B was used as mussel broth. This was then swirled for proper mixing and then poured into sterile petri dish. 2.4.3 Mussel protein degradation Mussel juice agar prepared above was used to investigate protein degradation potential among the isolates. It was prepared by adding autoclaved 1.5% agar to sterile mussel juice. After cooling to 45°C, the agar was poured into petri dishes and used for protein degradation by spot inoculating overnight cultures from TSA unto the dry surface of mussel juice agar. Plates were incubated at 25°C for 72h. Plates were observed for clear zone after 24, 48 and 72h. 2.4.4 Production of off odour Cooked mussel juice was prepared as above. Thereafter, 0.4g KH2PO4 and 0.575g K2HPO4 were added to 100mL of cooked mussel juice and sterilised at 121°C for 15min as described by Liu, Chen, Wang, and Ji (2004). Filter sterilised Trimethylamine N-oxide - TMAO (1.6g) and L cysteine (0.4g) were added while 10mL of the prepared cooked mussel juice was distributed into screw capped tubes. Tubes were inoculated with isolated and incubated at 25°C for 10days. Sample analysis was carried it on each day by pouring 1mL into petri dish and observed for smell – no off odour, weak off odour and strong off odour. Similarly, plate count of H2S bacteria on using serial dilution and spread plate methods were carried out. 2.4.5 TMAO reduction to TMA Reduction of TMAO to TMA is an indicator of spoilage in seafood. Isolates were therefore investigated for reduction of TMAO to TMA following modified method of (Makino et al., 2010; Mozaffarian & Rimm, 2006). The medium used per 100mL consisted of 2g peptone, 0.3g Lab Lemco powder, 0.3g yeast extract, 0.03g ferric citrate, 0.03g sodium thiosulphate, 0.4g NaC1, 0.4g KH2PO4, 0.575g K2HPO4, 0.05g MgSO4, 0.04g l-cysteine, 0.5g TMAO - 2H20, 0.4g agar and 0.1g of tetrazolium chloride as redox indicator. Both l-cysteine and TMAO were filter sterilise before adding to sterilised agar while 10ml of prepared medium was pour into screw cap tubes. Each tube was inoculated with 20μL of 103–104 cfu/mL culture and covered with sterile paraffin oil before incubating at 25°C and observed daily for colour change due to reduction of TMAO and precipitation of black FeS from sodium thiosulphate and L cysteine because of production of H2S production."
6,Molecular characterization,"2.5 Molecular characterization A single pure bacterial colony was used in molecular characterization. Culture was streaked on TSA and incubated overnight at 25°C. Thereafter, a loopful of each culture was then mixed with 100μL of PrepMan buffer in 1.5mL Eppendorf tube. Tubes were heated for 5min at 100°C for cell lysis. Amplification of 750bp region of the gene was carried out using universal primers: forward primer B27F (5′ - AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG - 3′) and reverse primer: 1429R (5′ - GGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT - 3′) and then sequenced using Applied Bio systems 3730 DNA analyser by Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF, Melbourne Australia). Chromatogram generated was edited with Bio Edit while the nucleotide sequence was analysed using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) of the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Sequence was then aligned with closest relatives. The sequence was also deposited in NCBI GenBank and was assigned MF599111 as the accession number. Phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA 7 software (DePaola, Jones, Noe, Byars, & Bowers, 2009)."
7,Qualitative volatile metabolites analysis,"2.6 Qualitative volatile metabolites analysis 2.6.1 Sample inoculation Based on the results of the spoilage evaluation described above, isolate sw19 was selected and used for investigating volatile metabolites production in cooked mussel broth. The isolate was cultured overnight in peptone broth. This was then 5-fold serially diluted using sterile distilled water. Thereafter, 100μL of the sample was added to 900μL of sterile distilled water while 100μL of inoculum as axenic culture was then used to inoculate 200mL mussel juice broth. Uninoculated mussel juice broth served as control. Both were incubated at 4°C for 10days. 2.6.2 Headspace volatile metabolite analysis using SPME GC MS Detection and identification of volatile metabolites produced by the axenic culture inoculated in the mussel juice broth was carried out using headspace solid phase micro extraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry (HS – SPME GC–MS) technology. The first step was selection of suitable fibre capable of detecting broad range of volatile metabolites. Divinylbenzene – DVB/Carboxen – CAR/Polydimethylsiloxane – PDMS Stable flex, a 3 phases fibre was selected based on this criterion. The fibre was pre-conditioned using 10mL of freshwater in screw capped vial for 20min for decontamination purpose. Water sample firstly incubated at 80°C for 30min. The inserted fibre was then transferred into GC MS machine (Bruker 300 – MS TQ Mass Spectrometer) for <10min. In the second step, 20mL mussel juice broth (both inoculated and control) in 40mL septum vial were incubated at 80°C for 30min in an oven (Hewlett Packard 5590 series 11) to attain equilibrium of the volatile metabolites. Thereafter, the pre-conditioned fibre was inserted into the samples via the septum at room temperature for 20min. Caution was taken not to allow the fibre to touch the sample before the exposed fibre was transferred into GC injector for 8-minute desorption of the volatile metabolites. The GC MS machine used was a split/splitless injector with full scan quadrupole detector equipped with Agilent DB 5MS capillary column based on helium as carrier gas with flow rate of 1mL/min, injector temperature of 270°C. Initially holding temperature was 40°C for 4min, then 80°C for 6C/min and then 250°C to 290°C at 25°C/min. The mass detector used was ion mass/charge ratio (35–350 m/z) with full scan mode. Acquired chromatogram and spectral obtained was analysed using Mass Spectrometer (MS) Data review by marching each spectrum with available compounds in the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST, USA) database. A baseline of >90 relative march was used as standard. Peak area of each spectrum was used to quantify volatile metabolites in the samples. 2.6.3 Data analysis Paired t-test was used to evaluate significant differences in enzymatic activities between the isolates from pouch water and mussel meat. Peak area of each volatile metabolite was normalised to quantify the volatiles. GraphPad Prism 7 was used in all the statistical analysis."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Isolation,"3.1 Isolation In this study, depuration treatment lasted for 4h, 8h and 12h post farm harvest. Commercial packs were used as control. Samples were then packed (modified atmosphere - MAP) at 80% headspace oxygen before incubating at 4°C for 15days. No H2S producing bacteria were isolated on day 0 (Table 1 ). Few colonies were barely (<20 colonies) observed on day 4 at 4h, 12h depuration and control. On day 7, H2S producing bacteria were moderately present (colonies>50) in samples from 4h depuration and control while colonies>20<50 were observed in samples from 12h depuration. Similar pattern was observed on day 10 while the bacteria were abundantly present in all the samples on day 15. The gradual increase in the number of H2S producing bacteria in the samples during storage has been described as major attribute of seafood spoilage bacteria (Gram & Dalgaard, 2002). A total of 46 H2S producing bacteria (61% of the isolates were from pouch water while 39% of the isolates from mussel meat) were randomly picked for biochemical characterization. Although sterile fresh water was added to the packs to maintain humid environment for the mussels thereby mimicking commercial practice, it was noted that the pouch water became suitable environment for microbial proliferation due to the mussels defecating into the packs. Information on the role of H2S producing bacteria such as Shewanella species in spoilage of fish and other seafood have been documented. However, there is dearth of information on role of Shewanella species on spoilage of MAP live mussels. Goulas et al. (2005) reported isolation and identification of S. putrefaciens in vacuum packaged and MAP shucked mussels (M. galloprovincialis) stored at 4°C. In a similar study by Caglak, Cakli, and Kilinc (2008), no Shewanella species was reported from wild M. galloprovincialis as only total viable count (TVC) was investigated in their study. None of the isolates from TVC was identified using biochemical or molecular method. Studies of Erkan (2005) and Turan, SÖNmez, ÇElİK, YalÇIn, and Kaya (2008) on quality and spoilage of refrigerated shucked mussels did not include bacteria as cause of spoilage. Ulusoy and Özden (2011) also investigated microbiological quality of MAP stuffed mussels stored at 4°C but no information on presence or absence of Shewanella species was reported. Pastoriza, Bernárdez, Sampedro, Cabo, and Herrera (2004) and Bernárdez and Pastoriza (2011) both studied quality of live mussels rather than spoilage. The former uses faecal coliform, Escherichia coli and Salmonella to indicate quality of live mussels, the later used TVC as quality indicator. Bernárdez and Pastoriza (2013) isolated H2S producing bacteria from intervalval liquid of live packaged mussels stored at 2°C and 7°C, however, no isolates were identified."
10,Biochemical and physiological characteristics,"3.2 Biochemical and physiological characteristics The biochemical and physiological characteristics of the isolates investigated in this study are stated in Table 2 . Production of black pigment on Iron agar due to oxidation of Iron sulphide (FeS) because of utilization of cysteine and thiosulphate has been used as differential phenotypic characteristic of Shewanella species (Makino et al., 2010; Romalde et al., 2014). To confirm this, all isolates (initially produced black pigment on Iron agar) were further tested on Iron agar with different sources of sulphur. H2S production indicated by black colonies was observed on all sources of sulphur tested including KIA after 24h incubation at 25°C. However, 8 isolates (w6, w11, w23, w29, m31, w36, m42 and m45) showed deeper black pigment than others. Abilities of the isolates to tolerate different levels of salt were investigated. All isolates could grow at 0–4.5% salt levels after 24h. However, it was observed that after 24h incubation, 65% (30/46) of the isolates could not grow at 6% salt level. Plates were further incubated for another 24h. At this time, only 22% (10/46) of the isolates could not grow. This led to incubating the plates for further 24h. All the isolates were observed to grow after 72h incubation. Our result was similar to that of Di Pinto, Terio, Di Pinto, Colao, and Tantillo (2012). They observed that all S. baltica tested were able to grow at 6% salt level but observed variation in growth at increased salt level of 8–12%. Birte Fonnesbech Vogel, Venkateswaran, Satomi, and Gram (2005) also observed similar variation among 80 strains of S. baltica isolated from ice stored fish. In contrast, Ge et al. (2017), reported that none of the 10 strains of S. baltica isolated from fish (yellow croaker) could grow at 6% salt level. The results of our study demonstrate the ability of the isolates to grow and survive in salt water environment in which the mussels were farmed. Salt tolerance have also been used to differentiate Shewanella species (Vogel, Jorgensen, Christensen, Olsen, & Gram, 1997), however, this may not be true in all cases. There is need for further investigation on use of salt tolerance for species differentiation. >55% (26/46) isolates could not grow at 4°C after 72h incubation. However, all the isolates investigated in this study could grow at 25°C and 37°C as shown in Table 2. This was different from the result obtained by J.J. Wang et al. (2014) in which all S. baltica isolated from spoiled shrimp were not able to grow at 37°C. Ge et al. (2017) reported that 8 isolates of S. baltica obtained from spoiled large yellow croaker could not grow at 37°C but could grow at 4°C, 25°C and 30°C. Duan and Su (2005) also reported aerobic growth of S. baltica isolated from spoiled whiting at 4°C to 30°C but not at 37°C. Similarly, our result was contrary to that of Ziemke, Hofle, Lalucat, and Rossello-Mora (1998) who isolated S. baltica strains that are unable to grow at 37°C from Baltic Sea. However, our result was similar to that of Birte Fonnesbech Vogel et al. (2005). In their study, some strains of S. baltica isolated from fish that were caught from Baltic Sea could grow at 37°C. The use of growth at 4°C and or 37°C to differentiate S. baltica and S. putrefaciens has been a long-time practice (Vogel et al., 2000). Our result shows that this may not be true in all cases. No reported study on isolation of S. baltica from MAP live mussels could be identified in the literature so as to compare our result. Di Pinto et al. (2012) observed that S. baltica could grow at 37°C after 3–6day incubation while isolates were incubated for 24h in this present study. This current result and that of others showed psychrotrophic abilities of S. baltica isolated from different seafood (Di Pinto et al., 2012; Duan & Su, 2005). It also indicates the spoilage potential of S. baltica at different temperatures. As stated by Tryfinopoulou et al. (2007), variation in growth at different temperatures could be as result of the different techniques. Some of the studies used broth for growth studies with or without salt (NaCl) added while some used agar with or without yeast extract supplement. The type of medium used will determine available sources of nutrients for the bacteria and hence could result into false positive or false negative results. Media used were not stated in few of the studies thereby undermining repetition of the study by other researchers. Tryfinopoulou et al. (2007) also stated that seafood storage temperature could determine the type of Shewanella species that will be prevalent in the samples. The ability of 20 out of 46 isolates being able to grow at 4°C signifies the potential of the isolates to cause spoilage of MAP mussels stored at cold temperatures."
11,Enzymatic activities,"3.3 Enzymatic activities Marlina, Son, Cheah, Napis, et al. (2007) hypothesized both protease and lipase enzymes in seafood spoilage bacteria can enhance seafood spoilage. This is because protease enzyme is required for degradation of seafood protein while lipase breaks down fatty acids present in seafood. We therefore examined both enzymes and DNase which is required for breakdown of DNA molecules (Di Pinto et al., 2012). Presence of protease was examined using skim milk agar, nutrient agar supplemented with Tween 80 was used for lipase activity among the isolates while DNase agar was used to detect presence of DNase enzyme. It was observed that 20% (9/46) of the isolates could not produce protease enzyme (Table 2). 50% of pouch water isolates and 61% of isolates from mussel meat showed moderate proteolytic activities. DePaola, Nordstrom, Bowers, Wells, and Cook (2003) reported presence of protease in S. baltica with only 2 isolates out of 8 not being able to produce protease. Unlike in our study, assay kit (bacterial protease) and photometric methods were used. Devi, Surendran, and Chakraborty (2009) also reported that Shewanella sp. produced protease at cold storage temperature. Di Pinto et al. (2012) stated that proteolytic activity in Shewanella is strain dependent rather than specie dependent as observed in our study. 24% of the isolates tested in our study could not produce lipase enzyme. Lipase enzyme is required for breakdown of fatty acids which are very much present in seafood including mussels. It was observed that isolates w9, w12, m17, w23 and w29 could not produce both enzymes. Only 2% could not produce DNase enzyme among the isolates. Similar to our result, Dileep et al. (2003) observed production of DNase in S. baltica isolated from ice stored fish."
12,Spoilage potential,"3.4 Spoilage potential To investigate spoilage potential and volatile metabolites production among the isolates, mussel protein degradation, reduction of TMAO to TMA and production of off odour (sulphide) were used as spoilage indices. All isolates were screened for mussel protein degradation due to presence of protease enzyme. It was observed that the isolates could degrade mussel protein (Fig. 2 ). There was no significant difference (p>0.05) in in the number of isolates from pouch water and mussel meat that could degrade mussel protein (Fig. 3 ). Based on the result obtained, mussel protein degradation activity among the isolates could be grouped into no proteolytic activity (NPA), slight proteolytic activity (SPA), moderate proteolytic activity (MPA), and strong proteolytic activity (STPA). About 7% of the isolates from pouch water could not degrade mussel protein. While 11% of isolates from mussel meat could not (NPA) degrade mussel protein. None of the isolates in pouch water showed slight proteolytic activity. >5% isolates from mussel meat could slightly degrade mussel meat. Among the isolates from pouch water, 25% and 39% from mussel meat could moderately degrade mussel protein. Most of the isolates could strongly degrade mussel protein as observed in this study with more of the isolates (68%) from pouch water and 44% from mussel meat. Overall, the isolates exhibited strong proteolytic activity on mussel meat agar incubated for 72h than on skim milk agar. This could be because of the different sources of protein. However, this assertion needs further investigation. There have been various reports on use of TMAO reduction as seafood spoilage index. However, no such study has been carried out among isolates of Shewanella obtained from mussels. Result of TMAO reduction is shown in Table 2. It was observed that only 26% (12/46) of the isolates could reduce TMAO to TMA. This was similar to the report of DePaola et al. (2003). Di Pinto et al. (2012) observed that 3 out of 16 strains of S. baltica from fish could not produce TMA Majority (9/12) of isolates that could reduce TMAO were from the pouch water samples. This was in contrast to the study of Dileep et al. (2003) that reported all strains of S. baltica isolated from ice stored fish were able to produce TMA. Duan and Su (2005) also reported that four S. baltica strains isolated from spoiled ice stored whiting fish could reduce TMAO at 25°C. It is noteworthy that our isolates were from mussels and not fish. Due to this, we further verify production of sulphide off odour among the isolates. We observed that 28/46 produced sulphide off odour while 7 could not produce either off odour and reduce TMAO to TMA. Reduction of TMAO therefore maybe dependent on source of isolates rather than generalised behaviour among Shewanella species."
13,Molecular characterization,"3.5 Molecular characterization Isolate m19 coded as MSSA1 from mussel meat showed highest mussel protein degradation, growth at 4°C, 25°C and 37°C within 24–72h. The isolate was halotolerant and lyse horse blood, produce H2S, reduce TMAO and contain lipase, DNase and protease enzymes. It was biochemically identified as Shewanella specie. However, there was need to use molecular method to identify the isolate at specie level as biochemical method of identification is not sufficient to distinguish species of Shewanella (Duan & Su, 2005). Due to this and other spoilage potential, 750bp region of 16S rRNA gene of the isolate was sequenced. The sequence was compared with nucleotides in NCBI database. The sequence was deposited into GenBank with accession number MF599111. The closest relative of the isolate at 100% similarity was S. baltica C422 (Fig. 4 ) which was isolated from Pacific shrimp stored at cold and ambient temperatures. Studies indicated that S. baltica caused spoilage of fish samples stored at 4–8°C. DePaola et al. (2003) reported isolation of S. baltica strains from spoiled yellow croaker fish stored at 4°C. Like this present study, they reported that S. baltica strains produced black pigment except 2 strains that produced white colonies on Iron agar and could reduce TMAO, and grow between 4°C to 30°C. The isolates also produced protease and lipase enzymes. In another, Duan and Su (2005) isolated S. baltica from spoiled whiting fish stored 8°C for 6days. In contrast to our study, the studies used both 16S rRNA and gyrB genes for molecular characterization of S. baltica. Di Pinto et al. (2012) reported prevalence of S. baltica in refrigerated swordfish and red tuna. In a recent study, Eja et al. (2008) isolated S. baltica from salmon and whiting fillets stored at 4°C. Results from these studies imply that Shewanella species are part of normal flora of farmed or wild seafood and becomes prevalent at cold storage temperatures."
14,Qualitative volatile metabolites analysis,"3.6 Qualitative volatile metabolites analysis Till date, no studies have reported isolation of S. baltica from live mussels. The result of this study indicates that S. baltica is responsible for degradation of mussel once they are dead in the packs. An evidence of this was the olfactory assessment of sulphide off odour observed in the packs during storage. To proof this, we investigated the headspace volatile metabolites of axenic culture of S. baltica in cooked mussel broth stored for 10days at 4°C. Using 3 phases fibre and GC MS, the volatile headspace metabolites of cooked mussel broth before and after inoculation with S. baltica strain MSSA1 were detected and identified. The chromatogram obtained is shown in Fig. 5 . A total of 44 volatile metabolites were obtained on day 10 whereas 27 were obtained before inoculation (Table 3 ). The compounds could be grouped into alcohols, aldehydes, phenol, furans, ketone, esters, organic acid, aromatic hydrocarbons, alkanes, nitrogen and sulphur containing compounds. Some of the compounds were found only in cooked mussel broth before inoculation or after inoculation (Fig. 6 ). The following aldehyde compounds were responsible for freshness flavour of mussels as obtained in this study: hexanal, heptenal, lilac aldehyde. Fakruddin, Sultana, Ahmed, Chowdhury, and Choudhury (2013) opined that aldehyde, ketone and alcohol volatile metabolites in seafood originated from enzymatic activities of lipoxygenase on unsaturated fatty acid in seafood. Sulphur compounds such as dimethyl sulphide, dimethyl disulphide, and dimethyl trisulphide were spoilage volatile metabolites (Fig. 7 ). Dimethyl trisulphide, methyl-phenol, 2-Ethyl-5-methylfuran, 3,5-octadiene and thiohexene were unique to inoculated sample while only 2-Ethylfuran was not obtained in control. Fewtrell et al. (2004) identified over 100 volatile metabolites from fresh and rotten mussels using GC MS. Among which are, alcohol, phenols, aldehyde, ketones, ester, carboxylic acid and hydrocarbon. In this study, we observed that some of the volatile metabolites were present consistently while some fluctuated. This was observed by Polo et al. (2014) in their recent study on microbial volatile metabolites obtained from inoculated sun bream fish stored at 0–2°C. Hexanal, heptenal, lilac aldehyde, octadecanal and C12–C15 aldehyde were identified on day 0 (before inoculation). Fakruddin et al. (2013) stated high occurrence of hexanal in M galloprovincialis. Benzaldehyde, nonanal, decanal and tetradecanal could be attributed to metabolic products of S. baltica strain MSSA1 because they were detected on day 10 in inoculated cooked mussel broth but not in control in addition to the previous 5 aldehyde compounds. This contrasted with the results of Polo et al. (2014) that reported presence of nonanal and decanal in fish broth. In our study, hexanal, heptenal, lilac aldehyde, octadecanal and C12–C15 aldehyde were observed to be high amount in mussel broth before inoculation but decreased on day 10 after inoculation. The following alcohols were detected on day 0 before inoculation: octenol, nonedienol and heptanol while octadienol and 3 methyl butanol were produced from microbial activities as they were only detected on day 10 post inoculation. Polo et al. (2014) reported production of 3 methyl butanol from microbial activity of Shewanella in fish stored in air and MAP. Previous study have also shown presence of alcohol in raw mussel meat (Fakruddin et al., 2013) similar to other seafood such as fish (Kim, Lee, Hwang, & Yoon, 2012). Four ketone compounds were identified. Methyl heptanone and methyl phenyl oxime were detected on day 0 while octenone, nonanone, methyl heptanone and methyl phenyl oxime were detected on day 10. The result of this study shows octenone and nonanone were from microbial activity of S. baltica. Indole was the only nitrogen compound detected in this study on day 10 after inoculation. Hence it could be attributed to microbial activity. This was like the result of Jun et al. (2012) that reported indole as product of microbial activity in shrimp. Both dimethyl sulphide and dimethyl disulphide were detected on day 0 while dimethyl trisulphide was detected on day 0 with the first two. Studies have shown that dimethyl sulphide could be derived from the breakdown of dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) commonly found in marine algae (Hara-Kudo et al., 2001; Higgins, Thompson, Deeks, & Altman, 2003). It could also be produced as gut microbiota by product of seafood or enzymatic activity (Hara-Kudo et al., 2001; Iwamoto et al., 2010). Mussels used in this study were harvested from mussel farm where they feed mainly on marine algae. In our study, it was observed that dimethyl sulphide and dimethyl disulphide increased on day 10 similar to report of Polo et al. (2014). This noticeable increase could be attributed to microbial activity of S. baltica while the initial detected dimethyl sulphide and dimethyl disulphide either from algae consumed by the mussels or enzymatic activity. The genus Shewanella has been mentioned among marine bacteria taxa that can degrade DMSP (Fakruddin et al., 2013). However, sterile mussel broth was used. Therefore, it may not be from enzymatic activity. Dimethyl disulphide significantly increased than the other two sulphur compounds. Soccol and Oetterer (2003) reported detection of dimethyl disulphide in wild mussels similar to the result of Ye, Huang, and Chen (2012) that detected dimethyl disulphide in deteriorated oyster. Dimethyl trisulphide could be attributed to metabolic activity of S. baltica. Kirs et al. (2011) reported dimethyl trisulphide in deteriorated clam which is a bivalve shellfish. Unlike the result of Kirs et al. (2011) who stated trimethylamine as dominant volatile metabolite, in our study, dimethyl disulphide was more abundant in deteriorated mussel broth. In this current study, butyl ester was identified only on day 10. This implies, the metabolite must have originated from microbial metabolism. Only one fatty acid was identified in this study. 16: OFFA was identified on day 0 and day 10 in inoculated and uninoculated samples. Mussels have been reported to be are rich in fatty acids such polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and amino acids (Chakraborty & Surendran, 2008; Franco-Monsreal & Flores-Abuxapqui, 1989; Greig et al., 2012) and mostly obtained from diet (Fyfe et al., 1997). Gil et al. (2007) reported that fatty acids could be were found in different organs of both male and female blue mussels (M. galloprovincialis). In a recent study, it was noted that MUFA and PUFA increased in autumn than in other seasons (Gonzales-Barron & Butler, 2011). These nutritional compositions of mussels could serve as precursor for either freshness or spoilage volatile metabolites due to microbial, enzymatic activities and autolytic degradation. Pentylfuran 1 and Pentylfuran 2 were both identified in this study. However, only pentylfuran 2 was identified on day 10. It was not detected in the samples on day 0 before inoculation. Zwietering et al. (1991) reported other furans such as 2-propyfuran and 2,3-dihydrofuran identified in Greenshell mussels. Other volatile metabolites identified are methyl phenol and TB henol. Phenol was detected on day 0 and 10 while methyl phenol was identified only on day 10. Aromatic compounds identified are toluene, 3,5 octadiene, ethylbenzene, 3-ethylthiophene, naphthalene and Bis(dimethylethyl) benzene aside the following hydrocarbons: tetramethyl pentane, undecane, dodecane, tridecane, pentadecane and heptadecane. Like our study, presence of hydrocarbons in mussels (Fewtrell et al., 2004; Lomelí-Ortega & Martínez-Díaz, 2014; Zhou, Zhong, Long, Han, & Liu, 2014) and other seafood (Franco-Monsreal & Flores-Abuxapqui, 1989; Fuenzalida et al., 2007; Fyfe et al., 1997) have been previously reported. Naphthalene was reported in deteriorated oyster by Ye et al. (2012). However, in our study, naphthalene was detected on day 0 and 10 after inoculation."
15,Conclusion,"The result of this study showed that live mussels harbour H2S producing bacteria such as S. baltica strain MSSA1 as normal flora. It is psychrotrophic and halotolerant spoilage bacterium that produces spoilage volatile metabolites during cold storage of live mussels. The spoilage potential of this isolate was proven and showed dimethyl disulphide as off odour volatile metabolites produced during storage of cooked mussels at 4°C for 10days. Our results show volatile metabolites could be used to assess freshness and spoilage of MAP mussels using HS-SPME GC/MS. There is need to study microbial community in MAP live mussels, spoilage potential and volatile metabolites produced in raw mussel meat with the use of either axenic and or mixed culture. Under the current commercial practice, live mussels only have 10days' shelf-life. Observed spoilage indices reduce consumers' acceptance, palatability and shelf-life of MAP live mussels Understanding spoilage mechanism and attendant spoilage indices will help in designing effective mussel quality protocols and shelf-life extension."
