0,Introduction,"As demand for energy continues to grow while the limited deposits of fossil fuels diminish (BP Statistical Review of World Energy, 2017), efforts to generate natural gas from coal (i.e., coalbed methane, CBM) have increased considerably over the last two decades (Scott et al., 1994; Flores et al., 2008). CBM has received global attention since its combustion emits significantly less CO2, NOx, SOx, and mercury than conventional hydrocarbons (Barnhart et al., 2017; Davis and Gerlach, 2018). CBM is formed mainly through geological (thermogenic) and biological (methanogenic) processes (Formolo et al., 2008; Park and Liang, 2016; Rice, 1993). Thermogenic CBM is generated at high pressures and temperatures through coalification, while biogenic CBM requires the metabolic activities of microorganisms and is classified as either primary or secondary. Primary biogenic CBM is formed during peatification, but is then removed from the system during compaction and coalification (Butland and Moore, 2008; Formolo et al., 2008; Scott et al., 1994; Scott, 1999). Secondary biogenic CBM is formed after the burial, coalification, subsequent uplift, and erosion of a basin margin (Huang et al., 2013a). Once biogenic CH4 gas is generated from coal deposits, new natural gas formation can be stimulated to extend the CH4 production life (Jones et al., 2008, 2013). The generation of biogenic CH4 from coal is a multi-step process involving the interaction of bacteria and archaea (Jones et al., 2010; Park and Liang, 2016; Ritter et al., 2015; Strąpoć et al., 2011; Thielemann et al., 2004). Under anaerobic conditions, methanogenic archaea generate biogenic CH4 by consuming only simple carbon compounds as substrates (e.g., acetate, formate, and CO2/H2). These methanogenic substrates are provided by complex microbial activities that consist mainly of fermentation and acetogenesis. Fermentative bacteria may first initiate the release of soluble organics from coal, and then biodegrade them into intermediates (e.g., fatty acids and alcohol) and simple by-products (e.g., acetate and H2/CO2) (Davis and Gerlach, 2018; Schink, 2006). More acetate can be produced by acetogenic bacteria from (i) H2 via acetogenesis by consuming CO2 and (ii) H2-producing acetogenesis by converting fatty acids (Green et al., 2008; Park and Liang, 2016). To accelerate the above process of biogenic methane generation, Scott (1999) proposed the concept of microbially enhanced CBM (MECBM). Current MECBM projects most commonly employ the following scheme: the introduction of nutrients into coal seams (i.e., bio-stimulation), addition of microorganisms (bio-augmentation), hydraulic fracturing to increase microbial access to coal, and chemical treatment to increase the bioavailability of coal (Colosimo et al., 2016; Jones et al., 2013; Ritter et al., 2015). However, given that field tests of MECBM pilot projects have not produced CH4 as expected at commercially viable levels, other methods are being developed (Ritter et al., 2015). Considering that coal solubilization is a rate-limiting step for successful MECBM production (Green et al., 2008; Park and Liang, 2016), chemical agents have been used to solubilize coal for subsequent microbial activities (Bumpus et al., 1998; Green et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2013a, 2013b; Papendick et al., 2011). Previous studies (Mae et al., 2001; Miura et al., 1997; Tamamura et al., 2016) have also shown that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can substantially solubilize lignite (low-rank coal) in batch experiments and generate organic acids (e.g., acetic and formic acids), which have been identified as methanogenic substrates (Chen et al., 2017; Strąpoć et al., 2011). In addition, H2O2 is not a pollutant because it decomposes to O2 and H2O (Doskočil et al., 2014; Klenk et al., 2000; Tamamura et al., 2016). Accordingly, Aramaki et al. (2017, 2015) proposed the concept of subsurface cultivation and gasification (SCG) using H2O2 as a solubilizing agent to enhance the in situ biogenic CH4 generation from lignite in northern Hokkaido, Japan. Their laboratory experiments confirmed the relatively fast production (<1 year) of biogenic methane (>2 cm3 per gram of lignite) from the reaction solution of lignite and H2O2 (by methanogens) (Fig. S1). More recently, Haq et al. (2018) encouraged the field application of SCG by demonstrating the optimization of biogenic CH4 yield from the increased solvable components in bulk lignite after reaction with H2O2. The concept of SCG mainly involves the injection of high-pressure H2O2 solution into lignite seams to rapidly produce low-molecular-weight organic substances for methanogenesis (Fig. 1 ). During H2O2 injection, acidification and oxidation likely occur, and are detrimental to native microorganisms (Gallagher et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2013). Therefore, other reagents (e.g., reducing and pH neutralizing agents) may also be injected, when the natural buffering capacity (Heron et al., 1993; Langmuir, 1997) does not sufficiently regulate the subsurface environment after H2O2 injection to allow microorganism growth. The SCG concept for the production of biogenic methane has great promise, yet its applicability in the field remains uncertain since only batch experiments have been conducted in the laboratory (Tamamura et al., 2016; Aramaki et al., 2017). Therefore, the main purposes of this study are to confirm (i) the reactivity of lignite with H2O2 under simulated natural conditions using column experimental systems, and (ii) biogenic methane production from reaction solutions of lignite and H2O2 by methanogens in lignite."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Lignite,"2.1 Lignite The lignite used in this study was collected from the Miocene Soya coal-bearing formation in the Tempoku Coalfield in Horonobe, northern Hokkaido, Japan, which is the largest lignite deposit in Japan (recoverable resources of 1 billion tons; Kato et al., 1990). The sample was collected from a riverbed outcrop in the Teshio Experimental Forest of Hokkaido University. Specifically, clumpy lignite (1000–10,000 cm3) was dug out from depths of 5–40 cm, where anaerobic conditions were likely maintained, as inferred from the presence of active methanogens in the sampled lignite (Aramaki et al., 2017; this study). The collected lignite, used as microbial inoculum for cultivation experiments, was immediately packed under anaerobic conditions using an AnaeroPack system (Mitsubishi Gas Chemical). Outcrop samples, rather than core (in situ lignite), were selected not only because they were more easily obtained but also because they were likely to contain a methanogenic microbial community that utilizes lignite as a carbon source, similar to in situ lignite. In the laboratory, the lignite was dried and ground to 0.5–1.0 mm under ambient atmosphere, using a mortar and pestle for column experiments. For cultivation experiments, it was crushed in an anaerobic chamber to <2 cm, small enough to fit into a glass vial. The total organic carbon (TOC) content, volatile matter content, and calorific value of the sampled lignite are about ~69%, 47%–53%, and 6900–7200 kcal/kg, respectively, on a dry ash free (DAF) basis (Haq et al., 2018; Tamamura et al., 2016)."
3,Column experiments,"2.2 Column experiments A glass column (inner diameter, 1.1 cm; length, 30 cm) was loaded first with a baffle layer of spherical glass beads (diameter, 2 mm), then with lignite (17 g) and another baffle layer (Fig. S2). Hydrogen peroxide solution was injected into the column layer at room temperature (22 ± 2 °C) by a peristaltic pump (MP-2000, Tokyo Rikakikai, Japan). Four cases with different H2O2 concentrations and flow rates were tested (Table 1 ). As a control, a similar column experiment was performed using ultrapure water. These columns and measurements were duplicated to evaluate data reproducibility. The effluent solutions were directly collected in a 100 mL bottle kept in a cooler box to retard possible reactions before their removal for sampling and replacement. The collected samples were analyzed for concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), organic acids, and H2O2, as well as pH and oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) (Fig. S3). Effluent collection continued until the DOC and organic acid concentrations were stable. These conditions were achieved before the lignite lost 20% of its weight by solubilization."
4,Cultivation experiments,"2.3 Cultivation experiments To evaluate methane production from the reaction solution of lignite with H2O2, methanogen cultivations were set up (Fig. S4) using the effluent solutions collected from the column experiments when the organic acid concentrations were relatively high (above average). Each effluent solution was heated at 70 °C for 24 h to reduce remaining H2O2 concentration by reaction with the DOC components. However, the solution in case 3 (i.e., 0.3% H2O2, low flow rate) was not heated because the effluent's H2O2 concentration was already low (<0.05 ppm; Fig. S5). Heating lowered the H2O2 concentration in case 1 to <0.05 ppm, but not in cases 2 and 4 (in which it remained >0.5 ppm). Considering that H2O2 is detrimental to microorganisms, cultivation experiments were therefore continued only with the effluents from case 1 (with heat treatment) and case 3 (without heat treatment). Tables S1 and S2 respectively summarize the resultant DOC and organic acid concentrations of these effluent solutions. After vacuum filtration (2 μm filter paper, Kiriyama, Japan) of the collected effluents, phosphoric pH buffer (0.6 M NaH2PO4, 0.1 mL per 100 mL) was added into them. Eight different cultivation conditions were prepared in these solutions with or without minerals and a reducing agent (Table 2 ). The minerals consisted of NH4Cl (0.5 g/L), MgCl2·6H2O (0.5 g/L), CaCl2 (0.14 g/L), KCl (0.1 g/L), Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2·6H2O (0.002 g/L), NaHCO3 (2.5 g/L), and trace mineral solution SL-10 (1 mL/L). The trace mineral solution contained FeCl2·4H2O (1500 mg/L), ZnCl2 (70 mg/L), MnCl2·4H2O (100 mg/L), H3BO3 (6 mg/L), CoCl2·6H2O (190 mg/L), CuCl2·2H2O (2 mg/L), NiCl2·6H2O (24 mg/L), Na2MoO4·2H2O (36 mg/L), and 10 mL of 25% HCl. The minerals were dissolved completely into the effluent. Each effluent, with or without these minerals, was subsequently neutralized to around pH 7.0 with 2.0 M NaOH. In an anaerobic chamber, the various effluents (40 mL) were transferred into a 50 mL autoclaved-glass vial in the presence of 35 g of the pulverized lignite as methanogenic inoculum. Then, 0.4 mL of reducing agent (50 g/L Na2S) was added to the vials of treatment 3, 4, 7, and 8 (Table 2) in the chamber. After sealing the vials with a butyl rubber stopper and an aluminum crimp, the headspace gas in each vial was substituted with a gas mixture comprising anoxic N2/CO2 (80:20, by volume) using a gas exchanger (GR-8, Sanshin Industries, Japan) before incubation at 27 °C for 130 days. Each cultivation treatment was duplicated, and a control with similar cultivation conditions using ultrapure water was also tested. During the incubation, the CH4 concentration in the headspace was periodically measured by collecting 1 mL of the gas using a gas-tight syringe."
5,Analysis,"2.4 Analysis The DOC concentrations of the sample solutions were analyzed by a TOC analyzer (TOC-VCHS TOC analyzer, Shimadzu, Japan) with a precision of better than ±0.30%. Before injecting the sample solution into a combustion tube (720 °C), it was automatically acidified using HCl and purged with pure air to remove inorganic carbon. Organic acids (formic, acetic, oxalic, malonic, and succinic acid) were measured by an ion chromatograph (761 Compact IC, Metrohm, Switzerland) with a precision of better than ±2.0%. The concentration of H2O2 was measured by a commercial colorimetric method (Hydrogen Peroxide Assay Kit, CL-204, National Diagnostics, USA) with an accuracy of better than ±3.0%. Gas compositions (CH4, CO2, O2, and N2) were measured by gas chromatography (GC-14B, Shimadzu, Japan) with a precision of better than ±3.5%. At the end of the cultivation experiments, bulk DNA was extracted from lignite slurry samples (2 mL) using a MoBio Powersoil® DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio Laboratories, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The samples were collected from vials by a syringe after disinfecting the butyl rubber and shaking each vial to mix the sample. To increase the DNA recovery, the method was modified by repeating (2–3 times) the addition of “Solution 3 (200 μL)” from the isolation kit to precipitate humic substances as impurities. The extracted DNA was amplified and sequenced at FASMAC Laboratory, Kanagawa, Japan. V4 regions of 16S rRNA genes were amplified using a universal primer set: 515f (5′- GTGBCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3′) and 805r (5′-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3′). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed according to the following protocol: 94 °C for 2 min; 23 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s; and a final step at 72 °C for 2 min. After purification of the PCR products, they were sequenced using an Illumina Miseq Next Generation Sequencer. The sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using a cut-off of 97% identity to the 16S rRNA gene sequences. After taxonomy assignments, diversity indices (Chao1) and coverage values were calculated. The latter were calculated using eq. [1-(n/N)], where n is the number of OTUs in a single read and N is the total number of reads (Narihiro et al., 2014). The 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing data obtained in this study have been deposited in the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) under the accession number DRA006757."
6,Results,
7,Reaction solution of lignite with H2O2,"3.1 Reaction solution of lignite with H2O2 Concentrations of both DOC (Fig. 2 ) and organic acids (Fig. 3 ) increased rapidly during the initial stage of the column experiment (Table 1), and then both stabilized following a similar trend. In terms of the effects of flow rates, the concentrations of DOC and organic acids were higher at a lower flow rate than at a higher flow rate. At the lower flow rate, the maximum DOC concentration reached 6330 mg/L, with maximum concentrations of acetic acid, formic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, and oxalic acid of 612, 1810, 528, 919, and 1380 mg/L, respectively. At the higher flow rate, the maximum DOC concentration was 3940 mg/L, while the maximum concentrations of the acids were 380, 1030, 393, 362, and 1590 mg/L, respectively. From previous studies, the DOC components other than these organic acids would be glycolic acid (Miura et al., 1997), adipic acid, pimelic acid (Doskočil et al., 2014), and humic acid (Haq et al., 2018). The concentrations of DOC and organic acids were proportional to the initial concentration of H2O2 in the influent solution: the reaction of 3% H2O2 with lignite resulted in higher DOC and acid concentrations in the effluent solution compared with those from 0.3% H2O2. However, the effluent of 3% H2O2 was not used as a cultivation solution because the remaining H2O2 concentration was high, as mentioned above."
8,Biogenic CH4 generation from lignite–H2O2 reaction solutions,"3.2 Biogenic CH4 generation from lignite–H2O2 reaction solutions The CH4 concentrations (Fig. 4 ) in the cultivation experiments (Table 2) showed a high degree of reproducibility, with relative standard deviations of <1.0%. Cultivation with the higher flow rate (Fig. 4a) produced CH4 concentrations (6.9%–10.2%) lower than those achieved using the lower flow rate (Fig. 4b; 11.9%–14.6%) in each condition. The production of CH4 was greater with neither minerals nor reducing agents than those when minerals only, a reducing agent only, or both minerals and a reducing agent were present. The CH4 production did not result from desorption from the lignite samples, as very low levels of CH4 (<0.02%) were detected from the control. The concentrations of organic acids just before the cultivation experiments (Table S3) significantly decreased to <10 mg/L afterwards, thus reaching levels similar to those in the control solution. These results suggest that the dominant carbon sources for microbial growth included these organic acids (e.g., acetic and formic acids) in the lignite–H2O2 reaction solution."
9,Microbial community structure in the cultivations,"3.3 Microbial community structure in the cultivations The 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing analysis using a universal primer set showed diverse archaeal and bacterial cultures in the vials that would lead to the generation of CH4. In total, 31,900 archaeal and 948,000 bacterial sequence reads were generated (Table 3 ), with average number of reads of 3990 and 118,000, respectively. The Chao1 estimates of total microbial diversity (i.e., archaea and bacteria) were higher (63%–84%) than the observed number of OTUs. The coverage values were > 99%, suggesting that the OTUs retrieved in this study were sufficient for estimating the microbial diversity (Narihiro et al., 2014). The OTUs affiliated with the class Deltaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Betaproteobacteria, Clostridia, and Methanomicrobia were major microbial constituents in the methanogenic culture with lignite-H2O2 reaction solution. Phylogenetic classifications of the archaeal and bacterial sequences are given in Figs. 5 and 6 , respectively. The families Methanoregulaceae (20%–68% OTUs) and Methanosarcinaceae (16%–52% OTUs) were the most prevalent methanogens in all the cultivation treatments, followed by Methanocellaceae (1.7%–16% OTUs). Methanobacteriaceae, Methanosaetaceae, and Methanomassilicocaceae were also present in minor (<5% OTUs) amounts. In contrast, few methanogens (<8% of total archaeal) were detected in the control culture. Bacterial sequences among the cultivation treatments varied, with about 40% of OTUs at the genus level occurring at relative abundances of <1% and being classified as “other”. They consisted mainly of anaerobic fermentative, acetogenic, and syntrophic bacteria. At the phylum level, Proteobacteria (29%–46% OTUs) followed by Bacteroidetes (13%–30%) and Firmicutes (7.5%–15% OTUs) were dominant. At the family level, Geobacteraceae and Syntrophaceae (of the phylum Proteobacteria) dominated the total community with abundances of 2%–17% OTUs and 5%–8% OTUs, respectively, followed by Veillonellaceae (1%–12% OTUs) and Clostridiaceae (1%–2% OTUs) of the phylum Firmicutes. Cultivation without minerals or reducing agent led the family Rhocyclaceae (Dechloromonas) to show relatively high abundances (6%–8% OTUs). The families Porphyromonadaceae (Paludibacter) and Spirochaetaceae (Treponema) were also observed with relative abundances of 3%–6% OTUs and 2% OTUs, respectively, in the presence of minerals only and a reducing agent only."
10,Discussion,"The reaction of H2O2 under simulated groundwater flow conditions “consistently” solubilized lignite (Fig. 2) and generated acetic and formic acids (Fig. 3), comparable to the findings of batch tests (Tamamura et al., 2016; Aramaki et al., 2017). The DOC and organic acid concentrations were also consistent with the amounts of CH4 generated (Fig. 4). Specifically, the CH4 concentrations resulting from the lower flow rate were higher than those from the higher flow rate, while the DOC (Fig. 2) and organic acid (Fig. 3) concentrations at the lower flow rate solution were also higher than those at the higher flow rate. However, if the percentage concentrations of headspace CH4 from the 17 g of lignite used in these column experiments are converted into cm3 CH4 per g lignite, as summarized in Fig. S6, less biogenic CH4 would be produced from the lignite at the lower flow rate than at the higher flow rate. The calculated results (Table 4 ) indicate that about 6 cm3 CH4 could be generated per g lignite, and the maximum production rate over 130 days was 0.14 cm3/g/day. The CH4 generation potential here is mostly higher than the CH4 produced from reaction solutions of lignite and H2O2 in batch experiments (Aramaki et al., 2017; Fig. S1) and previous results using various combinations of microorganisms and coals, which have been reported to vary between 0.006 and 8 cm3/g (Fallgren et al., 2013a, 2013b; Green et al., 2008; Jones et al., 2008; Opara et al., 2012; Papendick et al., 2011; Zheng et al., 2017). The reactions CH3COOH → CO2 + CH4 and 4HCOOH → CH4 + 3CO2 + 2H2O (Ehrlich and Newman, 2009) indicate maximum theoretical CH4 conversions from acetic and formic acids of 7.8 and 11.3 cm3/g lignite, respectively, at low and high flow rates, respectively, based on the initial acetic and formic acid concentrations (Table S3). They correspond to increases of 1.6–1.9 times relative to the extrapolated CH4 generation (Table 4). These inconsistencies between the theoretical and extrapolated CH4 production values might be caused by microbial assimilation (Alber et al., 2006; Clifton, 1951). It is possible that part of the acetate (and formate) may be used for cell growth (assimilation), and not for methanogenesis. Although this study did not exactly represent in situ conditions due to, for example, substantially greater pressures in subsurface coal beds (e.g., >2 × 103 atm at depths of >455 m; Davis and Gerlach, 2018; Zhao et al., 2016), the CH4 production seen here confirmed that the enrichment of substrates in reaction solutions of lignite and H2O2 could support microorganisms for methanogenesis. An interesting finding of this study was that the highest CH4 productions were observed without additional minerals or reducing agent (Fig. 4a). In many previous studies, such additions at appropriate concentrations stimulated microbial growth (Colosimo et al., 2016; Fallgren et al., 2013b; Jones et al., 2013; Ritter et al., 2015), but here they did not raise CH4 production. Because lignite as a microbial inoculum was sampled from a riverbed outcrop, the microbial consortia might have comprised aerotolerant organisms. This could explain the negligible effect of the reducing agent in stimulating methanogenesis in the culture. The identification of diverse microbial communities (Table 3) provided some insights into the likely pathways involved in the CH4 generation in this study. The microbial consortium of the lignite sample contained a substantial proportion of methanogens (Fig. 5) that are different from those found in Yubari coal mine, central Hokkaido (Shimizu et al., 2007). Methanogens of the family Methanoregulaceae, associated with a hydrogenotrophic pathway (Oren, 2014a), were found to be the most abundant in this study. Some can utilize H2 and formate (Methanoregula formicica; Yashiro et al., 2011); others are strictly H2-utilizing methanogens (Methanoregula boonei; Bräuer et al., 2011). The second most abundant methanogen family was Methanosarcinaceae, which is a versatile genus of acetate-utilizing methanogens. They are not only capable of cleaving acetate to CH4 and CO2, but also of converting H2/CO2 to CH4 and growing on methylotrophic substrates (Oren, 2014b; Zinder, 1993). While the reaction solution of lignite with H2O2 provided acetate and formate as ready substrates for direct methanogenesis, the methanogenic pathways might also have been affected by the activities of the bacterial population (Fig. 6), which was dominated by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes. These bacteria are commonly found in coal bed consortia (Green et al., 2008; Jones et al., 2008; Robbins et al., 2016; Strapoć et al., 2008). Among these bacterial groups, the family Geobacteraceae was the most abundant in the cultivations, especially in the presence of minerals and a reducing agent. They can syntrophically oxidize organic acids and aromatic hydrocarbon to produce CO2 (Coates et al., 1995; Lovley and Lonergan, 1990; Röling, 2014). The second most abundant bacterial group was the family Syntrophaceae, which grows only in the presence of H2/formate-utilizing partners in syntrophic association and is capable of oxidizing acetate to H2/CO2 completely (Kuever, 2014). In contrast, Clostridiaceae may act as homoacetogens that are able to produce acetate by consuming H2/CO2 (Green et al., 2008; Park and Liang, 2016; Zhang et al., 2015). In addition, Paludibacter, Dechloromonas, and Treponema, which were detected in all methanogenic cultures in this study, are fermentative bacteria capable of producing H2/CO2, formate, and acetate from a wide range of organic substrates (Jones et al., 2013; Robbins et al., 2016; Strąpoć et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2017). Based on the above discussion, possible transformation pathways of lignite in the Tempoku coal field via H2O2 into biogenic CH4 are summarized in Fig. 7 . During the reaction of lignite with H2O2, organic substrates such as acetate, formate, and other substrates (e.g., succinic, and oxalic acids) emerge (Fig. 3). After H2O2 decomposition and pH neutralization, fermentative bacteria convert part of the solubilized organic substrates from the lignite into H2/CO2 and acetate. Owing to the presence of syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria, acetate should also be converted into H2/CO2 (Hattori, 2008). Finally, biogenic CH4 is generated from the acetate, H2/CO2, and formate by the hydrogenotrophic (formate-utilizing) and aceticlastic methanogenesis pathways (Ehrlich and Newman, 2009; Zinder, 1993). These findings present a great opportunity to produce biogenic CH4 from the world's lignite seams. The Tempoku coal field, for example, contains at least 7 billion m3 of CH4 potentially recoverable by injecting H2O2 into its lignite seams without additional microorganisms (bio-augmentation) or minerals (bio-stimulation), estimated by the present results. Furthermore, the enriched O-functional groups in the solvable components of lignite after H2O2 reaction would promote the additional production of substrates, thereby enhancing the biogenic CH4 yield of SCG (Haq et al., 2018). Aramaki et al. (2017) examined the potential leakage of toxic substances (Cd, CN−, Pd, Cr(IV), As, total Hg, alkyl-Hg, Se, NO3 − + NO2 −, F−, and B) from a reaction between H2O2 and lignite collected at the same location as used in the present study (10 g lignite reacted with 1 L 1% H2O2). The results showed that most substances were leached at levels below Japanese regulated values; the only exception was As, which leached (0.025 mg/L) at a level slightly above the regulated maximum (0.01 mg/L). Some carcinogenic organic substances, such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), might also leach from lignite during reaction with H2O2. Depending on the subsurface conditions, if these pollutants are likely to appear, countermeasures (e.g., groundwater monitoring, immobilization of contaminated groundwater, and barriers) should be taken (Aramaki et al., 2017; Tamamura et al., 2016)."
11,Conclusions,"The findings of these column and cultivation experiments are as follows. (1) Lignite was substantially solubilized in H2O2 under simulated groundwater flow conditions and generated organic acids, similar to the previous batch tests. (2) Microbial consortia associated with lignite from the Soya Formation utilized solubilized organic substances resulting from the lignite using H2O2 to produce nearly 6 cm3 CH4/g lignite over 130 days, with a maximum rate of 0.14 cm3 per g per day. (3) Pyrosequencing analysis of the microbial consortium confirmed the presence of methanogens, such as Methanoregulaceae and Methanosarcinaceae, as the dominant archaea in the culture. (4) The in situ application of SCG without additional minerals, reducing agent, and methanogens is possible, provided that the pH of the reaction solution is neutralized."
