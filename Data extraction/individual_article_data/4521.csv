0,Introduction,"Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) have been extensively investigated in the past decade, because of their great potential for use in wastewater treatment and energy recovery applications [1,2]. BESs can be broadly classified either as a microbial fuel cell (MFC) or a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC). An MFC operates under resistance, while an MEC operates under an applied voltage. In the anode chamber of the MFC or MEC, there is a bacterial anode that oxidizes a carbon source. Subsequently, there is a generation of electrons and protons that transfer to the cathode [3,4]. Oxygen reduction to H2O occurs on the cathode of the MFC, leading to electricity formation, whereas in an MEC under anaerobic conditions there is a reduction of H+ to hydrogen gas [5,6]. The performance of a BES strongly relies on the activity and efficacy of the bacterial anode, which is considered the limiting element [7,8]. The major parameters influencing the bacterial anode activity are the electrode material and the exoelectrogenic biofilm on the anode [9]. Carbon-based materials in BESs are used as anodes, due to their high conductivity, good chemical stability and relatively low cost [10–14]. However, the hydrophobic character of carbon materials prevents microbial attachment to the electrode. To overcome this problem and to enhance the carbon hydrophilicity and biocompatibility, the carbon materials are pretreated, for example, with acid, high temperature and nitrogen-doping [15,16]. Wang et al. (2009) [17] reported on an MFC utilizing a carbon-mesh anode which was preheated in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for 30 min. This MFC reached a maximum power density of 922 mW m−2 at an approximate voltage of 0.6 V, compared to an MFC employing untreated carbon mesh which yielded only 811 mW m−2. Feng et al. (2010) [18] investigated surface oxidation of a carbon-fiber anode by soaking it in acid (H2SO4) while heating, which resulted in an increase of 25% in the maximum power density, compared to pristine carbon fibers. Scott et al. (2007) [19] examined the influence of graphite anode surface activation by nitric acid followed by a heat treatment at 200 °C, which increased the power density about 3-fold. However, these methods require extreme conditions to improve the bacterial attachment and the anode bioelectric activity. Recently an environmentally friendly method was reported, using cold nitrogen plasma to enhance the carbon-felt anode's hydrophilicity and biofilm formation [13]. The anode pretreatment with the various mentioned methods was not sufficient to protect the exoelectrogenic bacteria in wastewater from its harsh conditions or from the attachment of undesired bacteria. Immobilization of bacteria with hydrogels has been investigated in the past two decades; it is applicable in drug delivery [20], the food industry [21,22] and environmental remediation [23]. Hydrogel technology allows the immobilization of cells in an aqueous environment that is biocompatible and stress-protective in a wide range of temperatures, pH values, and in various chemicals, solvents and heavy metals. In addition, it allows diffusion of oxygen and nutrients inward, and of wastes outward [20,24,25]. Calcium alginate is an organic polymer commonly used for bacterial cell immobilization. It is considered a cost-effective, widely available material with easy preparation as a hydrogel. However, it has low mechanical strength, which causes the cells to be released from the hydrogel. This disadvantage can be overcome by mixing calcium alginate with chitosan. It was reported that the strong ionic interactions between the amino groups of chitosan and the carboxyl groups of alginate can lead to better mechanical properties of the composite layer, which prevent cell release [26–28]. Duarte et al. (2013) [27] studied Saccharomyces cerevisiae immobilization in calcium alginate and chitosan beads, in a tubular fermentation reactor for ethanol production. They reported that the calcium-alginate beads and chitosan were reused in eight fermentation cycles of 10 h each. The final ethanol concentrations were stable in all fermentations, and no bacterial contamination was observed [27]. Only a few reports have been published to date on immobilized bacteria using polymers in BECs. A mixed bacterial culture in an air-cathode MFC was immobilized using polyvinyl alcohol and powdered active carbon to treat distillery wastewater [29]. Recently, an MFC based on a bacterial anode that was immobilized using agarose (by inserting the anode into agar solution) exhibited power densities of 610 and 370 mW m−2, with acetate concentrations of 5 and 10 g L−1, respectively. In comparison, the power densities in the non-immobilized MFC were only 343 and 240 mW m−2, respectively [30]. In our study, the bacterial anode was immobilized using organic polysaccharides, namely alginate, and a combination of alginate and chitosan. The MECs which were based on the immobilized anodes were compared with a control MEC based on a non-immobilized anode (the control anode). Hydrogen evolution was identified based on the current output at the cathode of the cells (using a two-electrode system). The MECs based on the immobilized anodes along with the control MEC were operated in the presence of acetate as well as wastewater. In addition, COD removal and the bacterial communities using 16S rRNA were analyzed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of a single-chamber MEC utilizing alginate and chitosan to immobilize a Geobacter sulfurreducens anode, for hydrogen production and COD removal."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Treatment of carbon-cloth using cold low-pressure nitrogen plasma,"2.1 Treatment of carbon-cloth using cold low-pressure nitrogen plasma The carbon-cloth anode material was treated with cold low-pressure nitrogen plasma, using a plasma cleaner system (Harrick PDC-32G2-, USA; RF of 60 Hz, power of 18 W) for 2 min at a pressure of 2 torrs. Nitrogen cylinders (>99.00%) were purchased from Oxygen and Argon Works Ltd., Israel. The treated anodes were rinsed in demineralized water to preserve the hydrophilic nature of their surface [13,31]. The plasma-treated electrodes were used for the immobilization of G. sulfurreducens with alginate and chitosan, with alginate alone, and as a non-immobilized anode."
3,"G. sulfurreducens immobilization on anodes using alginate, and alginate-chitosan","2.2 G. sulfurreducens immobilization on anodes using alginate, and alginate-chitosan The process for bacterial immobilization on the anode was carried out using carbon-cloth with alginate, or with alginate and chitosan. In preparing plasma-treated carbon-cloth with immobilized bacteria using alginate (A-bacterial anode), 3% (w/v) sodium alginate was dissolved in 10 mL boiled distilled water (alginate solution) and gently shaken (24 °C, 1 min) with 10 mL G. sulfurreducens (1.0 OD590). This was followed by immersing the anodes into the bacteria-alginate suspension; 1.09 ± 0.1 mL of the suspension became attached to each of the anodes. The immersed anodes (containing the alginate and bacteria) were transferred to 150 mL of BaCl2 solution, incubated for 1 h for alginate polymerization (A-1 bacterial anode) [27], and sparged with N2 gas to maintain an anaerobic environment. After soaking in the BaCl2 solution, the electrodes were rinsed with sterile water and kept in Geobacter medium until set into the MEC. In preparing plasma-treated carbon-cloth with immobilized bacteria using alginate and chitosan (the AC-bacterial anode), 3% (w/v) sodium alginate was dissolved in 10 mL boiled distilled water (alginate solution) and gently shaken (24 °C, 1 min) with 10 mL G. sulfurreducens (1.0 or 0.1 OD590) (AC-1 and AC-0.1 bacterial anodes, respectively). The immersed anodes (containing the alginate and bacteria) were transferred to 150 mL of BaCl2 solution and incubated for 1 h for alginate polymerization [32]. The alginate-immobilized anodes were submerged into a 0.25% chitosan solution (0.25% chitosan in 1% acetic acid; pH was increased to 6.0 by adding 0.1 M NaOH) and kept under mild shaking for 10 min; each anode absorbed 0.31 ± 0.05 mL chitosan. The electrodes were rinsed with sterile Geobacter medium and kept in Geobacter medium until set into the MEC."
4,Operation of MEC utilizing the immobilized and non-immobilized anodes,"2.3 Operation of MEC utilizing the immobilized and non-immobilized anodes A single-chamber MEC was constructed using commercially available glass bottles (ISO LAB, Germany) with a total volume of 100 mL and a working volume of 80 mL. The bottles were sealed with a screw cap and GL-45 silicone rubber septa stoppers (SCHOTT AG, Germany) to avoid air exposure. Woven carbon-cloth (2.5 cm × 2.5 cm Parex fiber fabric; Fuel Cell Store, USA) was used for immobilized and non-immobilized anodes. For the cathode, one side of the carbon cloth (2.5 cm × 2.5 cm) was coated with platinum (Pt-0.5 mg cm−2; Fuel Cell Store, USA). The electrodes were spaced parallel to each other and separated by a polypropylene spacer net. Titanium wires were used as conductive material for both working and counter electrodes. An Ag/AgCl electrode (3.0 M KCl, +199 mV vs SHE; ALS Co. Ltd, Japan) was used as a reference electrode. Prior to constructing the MEC, each working electrode (carbon-cloth) was pretreated by cold low-pressure nitrogen plasma [13]. The different anodes were tested in quadruplicate: the carbon-cloth anode that was plasma-treated only (non-immobilized anode) which served as a control anode, the plasma-treated carbon cloth with immobilized G. sulfurreducens, using alginate with a turbidity of 1 OD590 (A-1 bacterial anode), and two anodes comprised of plasma-treated carbon cloth with immobilized G. sulfurreducens, using alginate and chitosan with a turbidity of 1.0 or 0.1 OD590 (AC-1 or AC-0.1 bacterial anode, respectively). The MEC that was based on the non-immobilized anode (the control anode) was inoculated with approximately the same bacterial amount as were the immobilized anodes. The MECs were replenished with Geobacter medium containing sodium acetate (10 mM), or with wastewater (WW; 1000–1600 mg L−1 COD), and were maintained at a temperature of 35 °C. The cells were placed on a magnetic stirrer for continuous electrolyte stirring at 120 rpm. The duration of the experiment was 5 weeks to provide enough time for bacterial development and investigation of bioelectrochemical activities."
5,G. sulfurreducens inoculum,"2.4 G. sulfurreducens inoculum G. sulfurreducens (DSMZ 12127) was grown in Geobacter medium (N′ 826, DSMZ Germany) in 12 borosilicate glass serum bottles in an atmosphere of 80% N2: 20% CO2 for about 5–6 days, until a significate of red bacterial aggregates was formed [12]."
6,Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of the bacterial anodes,"2.5 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of the bacterial anodes The AC-1 and A-1 bacterial anodes and the non-immobilized anode were collected from the MECs at the end of the experiment and were washed 3 times with a phosphate buffer solution. The samples were fixed by incubation in Karnovsky's fixative solution (mixture of 5% glutaraldehyde and 4% formaldehyde in 0.064 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) followed by incubating for 1 h in tannic acid (1%) and OsO4 (4%), to prevent bacterial cell shrinkage and thermal damage. The samples were washed three times with the phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.2) after each process. Finally, they were dehydrated using ethanol (30–100%) for 15 min at each concentration. The samples were air-dried and sputtered with gold. The morphology of the anodes was examined using a MAIA3 SEM in ultra-high resolution (TESCAN, Czech Republic)."
7,Microbial community analysis,"2.6 Microbial community analysis The microbial community analysis was conducted by HyLabs Pvt Ltd, Israel. DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Powersoil kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 16s library preparation for sequencing on Illumina was performed using a 2-step PCR protocol. In the first PCR, the v4 region of the 16s rRNA gene was amplified using the 16s 515F and 806R from the Earth Microbiome Project with CS1 and CS2 tails. The second PCR was done using the Fluidigm Access Array primers for Illumina, to add the adaptor and index sequences. Sequencing was done on the Illumina Miseq, using a v2-500 cycles kit to generate 2 × 250 paired-end readings. Demultiplexing was performed on Basespace (the Illumina cloud), to generate FASTQ files for each sample. The data was furthered analyzed using CLC-bio to generate OTU and Abundance tables."
8,Electrochemical analysis,"2.7 Electrochemical analysis The MEC was connected to a MultiEmStat3+ potentiostat (Palmsens, Netherlands) in a 3-electrode configuration. Potentiostatic control was maintained by poising the anode to +0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl (3.0 M KCl). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed in the potential range of −0.5 to 0.8 V and scan rate of 5 mV s−1, in order to acquire mechanistic and phenomenological data of the processes occurring in the system [33]. A scan rate of 5 mV s−1 was chosen after confirming the steady-state condition with the differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) results by attaining similar I–V curves. A similar scan rate has been used in other slow electrochemical reactions [11,34]. In all the cases, the potential (V) vs. Ag/AgCl reference electrode, unless specified otherwise. DPV analysis was applied in the same potential range for determining the current voltage (I–V) curve under stable semi-steady-state conditions. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) and pH were determined using APHA standard methodologies [34,35]. COD was determined using a closed reflux COD digester (MRC Labs, China), while pH was determined with a pH meter. Electrochemical tests were performed using a MultiEmStat3+ potentiostat (Palmsens, Netherlands). The chemicals and reagents used were analytical grade, and distilled water was used for medium preparation. ANOVA testing was performed in Microsoft Excel for all the comparisons. Hydrogen production rates were measured in the 2-electrode configuration, under an applied constant potential in the range of 0.2–0.8 V. The hydrogen production rate was calculated according to Equations (1) and (2) [12]. (1) Q H 2 = V H 2 [ m 3 ] × t [ d − 1 ] × V r [ m − 3 ] Here, VH2 = Volume of hydrogen production (m3); t = time (seconds/day); Vr = Volume of reactor (m3). (2) V H 2 = I × t × R × T k × F × P Here, I= Current (A); t = Time (s); R = Gas constant (0.0820577 L atm, mol−1 K−1); T = Gas temperature (K); k = Valence of substrate; F= Faraday's constant (96,485 C mol−1); P= Gas pressure (atm)."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Electrochemical activity of MEC based on AC anodes inoculated with different bacterial concentrations,"3.1 Electrochemical activity of MEC based on AC anodes inoculated with different bacterial concentrations To determine the optimal cell inoculation in the immobilized bacterial anode, an alginate bacterial solution was prepared containing 3% sodium alginate and G. sulfurreducens culture (0.1 or 1.0 OD590 nm) in a ratio of 1:1. The carbon-cloth anode was immersed in the alginate bacterial solution, resulting in about 1 mL of the solution becoming attached to the anode. The anode was transferred to a BaCl2 solution for alginate polymerization [32], then submerged in a chitosan solution to strengthen the ionic interactions [27]. In the latter step, about 0.3 mL of the chitosan solution became attached to the alginate anode. The alginate-chitosan (AC) bacterial anode was connected to the MEC; and on the 30th day, DPV measurement was conducted using acetate as the carbon source for the AC bacterial anode activity. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the MEC based on the AC-1 bacterial anode (inoculated with 1 OD) produced a current density of 10.09 ± 0.03 A m−2. In contrast, the MEC with the lower bacterial density of 0.1 OD (the AC-0.1 bacterial anode) generated only 5.40 ± 0.15 A m−2. It is interesting to note that in both cases, the onset potential (defined by the rise of the oxidation current above the background level) was nearly −0.5 V. A plateau curve was obtained from 0.1 V and −0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl, for the AC-1 bacterial anode and the AC-0.1 bacterial anode, respectively. The plateau curve was continued up to the highest potential used in this study, 0.8 V. Similar results were reported by Guo et al. (2017) [2] using a stainless-steel flame-oxidized electrode, where the onset current was around −0.45 V vs. Ag/AgCl, and a plateau curve was observed from −0.2 V until 0.2 V [2]. Flexer et al. (2016) [36] studied a prospective new microbial hierarchical porous electrode. The results showed that the onset potential was −0.45 V and reached a plateau of maximum current at around 0.15 V vs. Ag/AgCl. They suggested that the maximum current was limited by either the enzymatic activity of acetate degradation, or the diffusional limited current of reactive intermediates through the three-dimensional film on the electrode; i.e., the arrival of acetate and diffusion of H+ outside of the biofilm. The effect of bacterial concentration in the immobilized layer on hydrogen formation was examined using an MEC utilizing the AC-1 and AC-0.1 bacterial anodes. These MECs were connected to the potentiostat in a 2-electrode configuration (the working electrode was connected to the platinized carbon cloth, while the reference and counter electrodes were connected to the AC-1 or AC-0.1 bacterial anode). As can be seen in Fig. 1B, the MEC employing the AC-1 bacterial anode yielded the highest cell current density, 9.75 ± 0.053 A m−2 at an applied voltage of 0.8 V; while the MEC operating with the AC-0.1 bacterial anode produced only 5.04 ± 0.15A m−2. A 52% higher hydrogen evolution rate (at a potential of 0.8 V) was calculated with the AC-1 bacterial anode (1.47 m3 m−3 d−1), compared to the AC-0.1 bacterial anode (0.76 m3m−3d−1)."
11,"DPV measurements of MECs utilizing immobilized and non-immobilized anodes, where the carbon source was acetate or wastewater","3.2 DPV measurements of MECs utilizing immobilized and non-immobilized anodes, where the carbon source was acetate or wastewater Current and hydrogen production measurements in MECs based on the AC-1 bacterial anode were compared to the anode in which same bacterial inoculum was immobilized using only alginate. In the latter case, the carbon-cloth anode was immersed only in a bacterial solution containing a suspension of sodium alginate and G. sulfurreducens culture (1 OD590 nm) in a ratio of 1:1, followed by transfer to BaCl2 for alginate polymerization. This anode was designated as A-1. Another MEC was constructed using the same bacterial inoculation as for AC-1 and A-1 bacterial anodes, but without the immobilization process (served as the control anode). This control was designated as the non-immobilized bacterial anode, and the inoculum was added directly to the MEC medium. The DPV was measured in a set of 15 potentials (between −0.6 and 0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl), with time intervals of 300 s at each potential; measurement was conducted on the 20th day with acetate, and on the 29th day in WW (Fig. 2 A and B). Fig. 2A shows the measured current density attained with electrode potential polarization, in the range of −0.6 to 0.8 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in the MEC operated on acetate. The highest current density values were obtained at the applied-potential range of −0.2 to −0.1 V. The current densities of the immobilized anodes were 9.77 ± 0.271A m−2 and 8.78 ± 0.096 A m−2, for A-1 and AC-1, respectively. The non-immobilized anode led to the highest current density of 10.95 ± 0.714 A m−2, 15% beyond those of the immobilized anodes. A plateau curve of all measured anodes occurred up to the highest measured potential, 0.8 V. Fig. 2B shows the measured current densities when WW was used as the carbon source. The MEC applying the AC-1 bacterial anode led to the highest current density value of 11.52 ± 0.0924 A m−2 at a potential of 0.2 V. In the A-1 bacterial anode, the maximum current density was 10.30 ± 0.347 A m−2 under the applied voltage of 0.5 V. In contrast, the non-immobilized anode showed a maximum current density of only 8.14 ± 0.025 A m−2 at the applied potential of 0.8 V. In the MEC which was operated using WW, the plateau region of these curves began at 0.2, 0.5 and 0.3 V, for AC-1, A-1 and non-immobilized anodes, respectively. When the MEC was fed with acetate, the plateau curves began at lower applied potentials of about −0.1 to 0 V."
12,Hydrogen formation in the MECs based on the immobilized bacterial anodes (AC-1 and A-1) and the non-immobilized anode,"3.3 Hydrogen formation in the MECs based on the immobilized bacterial anodes (AC-1 and A-1) and the non-immobilized anode The effect of the immobilized bacterial anodes (AC-1 and A-1) and the non-immobilized anode on the rate of hydrogen formation was examined when the different MECs were in a complete cell (2-electrode configuration). The LSV steady-state polarization for a cathode in the MECs was examined when the MEC was operated in acetate (Fig. 3 A) and in WW (Fig. 3B). The results depicted in Fig. 3A show that the highest hydrogen reduction current (11.52 ± 0.643 A m−2 at applied cell voltage of 0.8 V) was obtained in the MEC with the non-immobilized anode fed by acetate. In WW (Fig. 3B), the MEC applying the AC-1 bacterial anode led to the highest reduction current (12.01 ± 0.391 A m−2 at applied cell voltage of 0.8 V). Calculation of hydrogen evolution rates was performed according to Equations (1) and (2) in Materials and Methods. Under applied voltage of 0.5 V and with a pure culture of G. sulferreducens in a sterile medium containing acetate as the carbon source, the MEC based on the non-immobilized anode showed the highest current density and hydrogen evolution rate: 6.17 A m−2 and 0.58 m3m−3d−1, respectively. By contrast, in MECs based on the AC-1 and A-1 immobilized anodes, current densities were only 4.10 and 4.57 A m−2, respectively; hydrogen evolution rates were 0.39 and 0.43 m3m−3d−1, respectively. However, when the MECs were fed with wastewater containing different bacterial genera such as Methanobrevibacter, Methanocorpusculum, Bacteroidales, Bacteroides and Dysgonomonas (Fig. 6), the MEC based on the AC-1 immobilized anode led to the highest current density and hydrogen evolution rate: 5.96 A m−2 and 0.56, m3m−3d−1, respectively. The A-1 immobilized anode led to 3.22 A m−2 and 0.30 m3m−3d−1, respectively. In contrast, the non-immobilized anode led to only 1.66 A m−2 and 0.16 m3m−3d−1, respectively. We assume that when the MEC was based on a pure culture of G. sulferreducens and fed with sterile medium, the higher bioelectroactivity of the non-immobilized anode was evolved from the effects of mass-transfer limitations in the immobilized anodes. Many studies have shown external and internal mass-transfer limitations in fermentations based on immobilized whole cells [37–39]. However, when the MEC was fed with wastewater that contained many bacteria other than G. sulferreducens the immobilized anodes showed higher bioelectroactivity compared to the non-immobilized anode. In this case, we assume that the organic polymers alginate and chitosan limited the invasion and attachment of non-electrogenic bacteria existing in wastewater. As shown in Fig. 6, the immobilized anode was comprised of roughly 91% G. sulferreducens, while the non-immobilized anode had only 73%. The bioelectrochemical activity of the bacterial anode that was immobilized using alginate and chitosan (AC-1), which was higher compared to the anode that was immobilized using only alginate (A-1), probably stems from the high mechanical strength of the polymer derived from the presence of chitosan, which helps to maintain higher bacterial amounts. It has been reported that the strong ionic interactions between the amino groups of chitosan and the carboxyl groups of alginate can lead to better mechanical properties of the composite layer, which prevent cell release [26–28]. It is very difficult to compare our results with other studies reporting HER rates in MECs, since there is no uniform protocol. Therefore, many operating parameters vary considerably, including MEC configuration, electrode materials, cathode catalyst, distance between electrodes, reactor volume and carbon source [34,43–45]. The data depicted in Table 1 compares reported HER results of MECs having a reactor volume of less than 580 mL, a single chamber, and a carbon source of acetate, lactic acid or WW. Previously, Call and Logan (2008) reported on an MEC which led to a HER rate of 3.12 m3m−3d−1 with acetate, in a reactor volume of 0.03 L in a single-chamber membrane-less MEC at an applied potential of 0.8 V with a graphite-fiber brush anode [43]. Another study reported a HER rate of 0.53 m3m−3d−1 with a current density of 9.3 A m−2 in a single-chamber membrane-free MEC at the potential of 0.6 V with the volume of 0.1 L [46]. Jeremiasse et al. (2010) studied a Ni-foam cathode which showed a HER rate of 0.05 m3m−3d−1 at a potential of 1 V with a graphite-felt anode, 0.04 L and acetate as the carbon source [44]. To summarize, as seen in Table 1, carbon-brush electrodes in low-volume reactors at high over-potentials provided the highest HER rate (3.12 m3m−3d−1 at an applied voltage of 0.8 V). However, the results presented in our work are among the highest reported from MECs with a 2D carbon-cloth electrode in a relatively large-volume reactor (0.1 L) at low potentials (0.5 V). Moreover, in a partial low potential, this unoptimized cell design provided 0.56 m3m−3day−1, suggesting low energy consumption and lower cost of H2 production."
13,Measuring the currents versus time in MECs based on the AC-1 bacterial anode using acetate and wastewater as the carbon source for the bacterial anode activity,"3.4 Measuring the currents versus time in MECs based on the AC-1 bacterial anode using acetate and wastewater as the carbon source for the bacterial anode activity The currents obtained in MECs based on the AC-1, A-1 and non-immobilized bacterial anodes were measured during 37 days under an applied voltage of 0.3 V. The MECs were operated with acetate during 1–21 days, and with WW as the carbon source from 22 to 37 days (Fig. 4 ). On the 9–10th day, all the MECs reached a peak current of about 7.83 mA, and in each MEC the current decreased after several days with the depletion of acetate. Upon adding acetate, an increase in the produced current was seen, and in the 4th cycle of acetate feeding (18th day), the observed currents were similar in all the MECs: around 7.1–8.1 mA. A slightly higher current was observed in the MEC utilizing the non-immobilized anode (8.14 mA), compared to the immobilized anodes (7.5 and 7.8 mA). On the 21st day, the average observed current in the three MECs was about 3.9 mA. On the 22nd day, the MECs were fed with WW (1000 mg L−1 COD), and the current in the MEC utilizing the non-immobilized bacterial anode was only 3.81 mA. In comparison, the MECs utilizing the immobilized anodes exhibited currents of 6.13 (A-1) and 6.91 (AC-1) mA, respectively. On the last 3 cycles of WW feeding, the current produced by the AC-1 bacterial anode was between 8 and 10 mA, and about 8 mA with the A-1 bacterial anode. In contrast, the non-immobilized bacterial anode yielded only 3–4 mA. We assume that the higher activity of the MEC utilizing the AC-1 bacterial anode is attributed to the protection of the anode biofilm from invasion by non-exoelectrogenic bacteria present in the WW. Yong et al. (2013) studied graphite/alginate granule immobilization with Shewanella oneidensis in microbial fuel cells. Their results showed that a 150 mL dual-chamber MFC with immobilized cells led to higher columbic efficiency compared to that of an MFC with suspension cells: 0.84, 1.79, and 0.62 times higher on the 2nd cycle, the 3rd cycle, and in the total of 3 cycles, respectively [47]. It was reported that cell immobilization significantly increased the charge transfer, and that the electricity output of the MFC with the immobilized cells was much more stable than with suspension cells, at even high salt loadings [47]. Ganguli et al. (2012) immobilized yeast in electrically conductive alginate granules with a graphite-nanoparticle anode. The MFC applying this granulated anode led to a significant peak power density of ~244 μW cm−2; this was reported as the highest power density for yeast-based fuel cells [48]. Liu et al. (2011) studied a chitosan nanocomposite as a biocompatible biocathode material to enhance the electricity generation of an MFC by electrochemical deposition. The electricity generation increased by 67% and power density was increased by 130% with the chitosan nanocomposite MFC, compared with an MFC with a carbon-paper biocathode [49]."
14,COD removal,"3.5 COD removal Acetate and WW organic material degradation rates were evaluated by analyzing the COD in MECs applying the immobilized and the non-immobilized anodes. The COD inlet (in a range of 1000–1600 mg L−1) and removal percentages, where the carbon source for the MECs was acetate or WW, are shown in Fig. 5 . The 3rd and 4th cycles of adding acetate (the only acetate cycles shown in Fig. 5) revealed about 95% COD removal in all MECs. A slightly higher COD removal was observed in the MEC based on the non-immobilized anode (90%), compared to the immobilized anode (85%). In the first two cycles of adding WW with a COD of 1000 mg L−1, the COD removal percentage was about 75% in MECs based on the immobilized anode, whereas in the MEC based on the non-immobilized anode it was only 40%. In the 3rd and 4th cycles of adding WW with the inlet COD of 1000 and 1600 mg L−1, respectively, the COD removal percentage was about 78% in the MEC based on the immobilized anode; in the non-immobilized anode it was only 40%. Wang et al. (2018) [50] proposed an MEC-coupled up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor with an ultrasound sonication system for WW pretreatment. In this system, effluent COD concentration was maintained at 320–380 mg L−1 with a COD removal efficiency of 61.3%. Gil-Carrera et al. (2013) [51] examined the COD effect and the configuration of a semi-pilot modular MEC with a volume of 2 L domestic wastewater with the COD concentration of 100 mg L−1; the removal efficiency of COD was up to 85%. In fact, other research [41] has reported that MECs fed by domestic wastewater with a reactor volume of 0.58 L, using graphite granules in an anode chamber with a COD concentration of 360 mg L−1, achieved a final removal efficiency of nearly 86–90%. These results demonstrate that wastewater treatment based on MECs is feasible along with a concurrent generation of hydrogen. Besides MECs, an MFC was also applied to wastewater treatment. For example, reduction of chromium (VI) and vanadium (V) together with electricity formation was achieved in a dual-chamber MFC by employing vanadium as the cathodic electron acceptor. The efficiencies of vanadium and chromium reduction were 67.9 ± 3.1% and 75.4 ± 1.9%, respectively [52]. MFCs with sulfide and a COD removal efficiency of 91% and 52%, respectively, generated a maximum power density of 744 mW m−2 during 72 h [53]. The recalcitrant pollutant methyl orange dye was decolorized with an efficiency up to 90.4% within 360 min in a single-chamber MFC [54]. Pyridine at an initial concentration of 200 mg L−1 was degraded up to 82.9% in an MFC after 360 min of operation [55]."
15,Microbial diversity analysis on the immobilized and non-immobilized bacterial anodes,"3.6 Microbial diversity analysis on the immobilized and non-immobilized bacterial anodes The microbial diversity in the biofilm of the immobilized anodes was compared to the non-immobilized anode after the MECs were operated for four weeks in WW. The microbial diversity of each anodic biofilm was evaluated, based on 16S rRNA. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) readings were identified and phylogenetically classified. A total of 9 distinct phyla and nearly 30 genera were identified (Table 2 and Fig. 6) in all bacterial anodes. The microbial community varied significantly in the immobilized and non-immobilized MECs. In the three bacterial anodes, the dominant phylum was Proteobacteria. The non-immobilized anode biofilm included 74% Proteobacteria, while the A-1 and AC-1 bacterial anodes included about 92% Proteobacteria. The organisms belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria related mainly to Geobacter (AC-1: 91%; A-1: 91%; non-immobilized: 73%). The methanogenic bacteria in the immobilized anodes were less than 0.5%, while on the non-immobilized anode they were about 6%. These results showed that the AC-1 and A-1 bacterial anodes had lower species diversity than the non-immobilized anode, indicating that the in-situ immobilization of the anode partially blocked the invasion and development of other microbial communities on the anode. Zhang et al. (2019) studied microbial community responses to different geological environments and observed that Geobacter existed in all surface mineral soil/water samples [56]. Luo et al. (2016) [30] studied agarose immobilization on a bacterial anode in an MFC, where the diversity mainly consisted of Proteobacteria (68%), Bacteroidetes (16%), and Synergistetes (6.0%). In a non-immobilized anode MFC, 49% Proteobacteria, 15% Bacteroidetes and 15% Lentisphaerae were found. The comparative richness of Geobacter in the immobilized MFC was much higher than in the non-immobilized MFC (62% vs. 40%). The probable reason was that the average pore size inside 1% agarose gel is smaller than 0.5 μm; thus, it was more difficult for bacteria in the anolyte to invade the agarose gel. To summarize, immobilization of bacteria using organic polymers can prevent the invasion of non-desired bacteria into the anode."
16,SEM analysis,"3.7 SEM analysis With the naked eye it was observed that the AC-1 and A-1 anodes were covered with brick-red bacterial cells and a layer of alginate, while the non-immobilized anode was covered with brick-red aggregate bacterial cells only. However, at the end of all MEC operation (30 days), the anodes were visualized by SEM analysis. SEM images of immobilized and non-immobilized anode electrodes with a magnification of 150× (left) and 1000× (right), are shown in Fig. 7 . SEM images of the non-immobilized anode showed bacterial aggregation on and between the carbon fibers. SEM analysis of the AC-1 and A-1 bacterial anodes showed a dense coating layer on the anode, which wasn't seen in the non-immobilized anode. Under this layer there was a developed biofilm."
17,Conclusion,"In this study, G. sulfurreducens bacterial anodes were immobilized using alginate in combination with chitosan (AC bacterial anode), and alginate alone (A bacterial anode). The bioelectrochemical activity of the MECs based on the immobilized bacterial anodes was compared to an MEC based on a non-immobilized anode (control). MECs based on the AC bacterial anodes with different bacterial inoculations (1 and 0.1 OD 590 nm, designated as AC-1 and AC-0.1 bacterial anodes, respectively) generated a current density of 10.09 ± 0.027 A m−2 and 5.40 ± 0.153 A m−2, respectively. In both cases, the onset potential was nearly −0.5 V, and a plateau curve was obtained from 0.1 V and −0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl (for the AC-1 bacterial anode and AC-0.1 bacterial anode, respectively). The plateau curve was continued up to 0.8 V. When acetate was used as the carbon source, the current density of the MEC based on a non-immobilized anode was 10.95 A m−2, 15% higher compared to the immobilized anodes. When the MEC was operated using WW, the AC-1 bacterial anode led to the highest current density of 11.52 A m−2 at a potential of 0.2 V, 11% and 29% higher than the A-1 and non-immobilized anodes, respectively. When the MECs were operated with WW, the MEC utilizing the AC-1 bacterial anode provided a HER rate of 0.56 m3 m−3day−1 at an applied voltage of 0.5 V. In contrast, the A-1 yielded 0.30 m3 m−3day−1, and the non-immobilized anode provided only 0.16 m3 m−3day−1. When the MECs were operated with WW, the COD removal was about 78% in the MEC based on the immobilized anode, while with the non-immobilized anode it was only 40%. Microbial diversity analysis of the immobilized and non-immobilized bacterial anodes showed that the main organism on the immobilized anodes, Geobacter, was about 90%, while on the non-immobilized it was only 73%. SEM analysis of the immobilized anodes revealed a biofilm covered with a layer of presumed alginate. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating an MEC based on an immobilized bacterial anode using alginate and chitosan which produced high HER and efficient COD removal."
