0,Introduction,"Gold-based catalysts were well reported to exhibit super catalytic activity in a lot of reactions, e.g. glycerol oxidation, WGS reaction, and selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehydes, etc. [1–3]. Among the applied catalysts, Au-Pd bimetallic catalyst has shown its significant enhancement in catalysis, involving reactions of catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol, low-temperature methane oxidation and primary carbon-hydrogen bonds activation, direct formation of H2O2, etc. [4–7]. Direct synthesis of aldehydes with the corresponding primary alcohols is a very important chemical industrial process as the aldehydes are the critical pharmaceutical intermediates. The traditional processes for the production of aldehydes involve the use of inorganic oxides (e.g. permanganate or chromate), which are not only high-priced but also environmentally-unfriendly [8]. Instead, producing aldehydes with O2 or air as an environmentally-benign oxidant and noble metal as a catalyst has provided a novel approach to overcome the caused pollution. Direct catalytic conversion of benzyl alcohol under solvent-free is one of the most studied examples. Bimetallic Au-Pd catalysts have attracted big research attention for benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction since the catalytic activity was enhanced by twenty-five-fold compare to Au catalyst alone whilst retaining the selectivity towards benzylaldehyde, which was attributed to the electron transferring from Pd to Au [4]. As supports for Au-Pd nanoparticles, zeolite, titania, carbon, etc. have been widely used and reported, showing high catalytic performance under similar tested conditions [8–11]. There are many factors affecting the catalytic activity from the immobilized Au-Pd catalyst such as particle size, synthesis method, physico-chemical properties and morphologies of the support etc. As a typical catalyst support, CeO2 has attracted significant research attention owing to the excellent oxygen storage capacity, the closely interaction between metal and support, and the capability of easy shuttling between Ce3+ and Ce4+ oxidation states. CeO2 supported Au-Pd was reported to show outstanding catalytic performance in many reactions [11,12]. Interestingly, CeO2 morphology could decide the exposure of reactive planes and further influence the particle size of active metal, the interaction between noble metal and CeO2, and the dispersion of the precious metal. Recently, CeO2 with different morphologies exposing different facets were prepared successfully and indeed exhibited different catalytic activities in water-gas shift reaction [11,13]. Liu et al. synthesized CeO2 rod under the protection of N2 followed by in-situ load of Au and Pd nanoparticles applying surface redox mechanism between CeO2 and noble metal to produce AuPd/CeO2 rod catalyst, which showed high benzyl alcohol conversion and benzaldehyde selectivity [14]. David et al. also prepared Au-Pd/CeO2 nanorod catalyst with sol-immobilization method using NaBH4 as a reducing agent, which exhibited high catalytic activity in the same reaction under solvent-free condition [15]. In addition, Au-Pd supported on ceria-zirconia mixed oxide was also applied for the benzyl alcohol oxidation, a synergistic effect existed between Au and Pd during the reaction [16,17]. Up to now, only few reports focused on the influence of catalytic behavior of Au-Pd/CeO2 caused by the morphology/crystal plane of CeO2 in oxidation of benzyl alcohol. In the present research, CeO2 with different morphologies (rod, cube, and polyhedrons) was synthesized by hydrothermal method and used as supports for immobilization of Au-Pd bimetal through deposition- precipitation approach with urea as precipitant. Systematic investigations were carried out on the impact of support morphology of Au-Pd/CeO2 for benzyl alcohol oxidation under solvent-free."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemical reagents and gases,"2.1 Chemical reagents and gases The chemical reagents used in our experiments were all supplied by Aladdin company (Shanghai China) and used as received: benzyl alcohol (99.8%, purity), Urea (99.5% metal basis), NaOH (99.9% metal basis), Ce(NO3)·6H2O (99.95% metals basis), PdCl2 (99.999% metals basis), and HAuCl4·3H2O (≥99.9% trace metals basis). O2 (99.999%, purity) was supplied from Taiyuan iron and steel corporation."
3,Synthesis of CeO2,"2.2 Synthesis of CeO2 CeO2 nanorods, nanopolyhedrons, and nanocubes were synthesized by employing hydrothermal method based on Mai et al.’s report [11]. For CeO2 nanorods, 60 mL deionized water was applied to dissolve the 19.2 g sodium hydroxide and 20 mL deionized water was used to dissolve the 1.736 g cerium nitrate hexahydrate, respectively. Subsequently, the former was dripped into the latter. After stirring for 15 min, the mixed solution was injected into a 100 mL hydrothermal autoclave. Then the container was heated to 100 °C and hold for 24 h. When the obtained product was centrifuged and washed, the sample was dried at 105 °C for 12 h and calcined at 400 °C for 4 h to achieve the final product. For CeO2 polyhedrons, we only changed the dosage of NaOH from 19.2 g to 0.32 g. For the preparation of CeO2 with cubic shape, we only adjusted the hydrothermal temperature from 100 °C to 180 °C."
4,Au-Pd NPs immobilized on nanostructured CeO2,"2.3 Au-Pd NPs immobilized on nanostructured CeO2 Au-Pd nanoparticles immobilized on CeO2 (rod, polyhedron, and cube) were prepared through the deposition-precipitation approach with urea as the precipitant. Typically, to fabricate the Au-Pd/CeO2-rod, 2.00 mL aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (5 mg Au/mL), 1.08 mL aqueous solution of PdCl2 (5 mg Pd/mL), 0.985 g CeO2-rod and 3.48 g urea were added into 100 mL H2O, respectively. When the solution was stirred for 12 h at 80 °C. The autoclave was then cooled to ambient temperature, the obtained solution was aged for another 12 h. Subsequently, the precipitate was centrifuged, washed and dried. Finally, the obtained product was roasted at 300 °C for 2 h. For simplicity, CeO2-rod, CeO2-polyhedron, CeO2-cube, Au-Pd/CeO2-rod, Au-Pd/CeO2 -polyhedron, and Au-Pd/CeO2-cube catalysts were denoted as CR, CP, CC, ACR, ACP, and ACC, respectively."
5,Catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol,"2.4 Catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol The evaluation experiment was performed in a mechanically stirred reactor (50 mL glass-lined, Anhui Kemi machinery Technology Co., Ltd, China). Typically, 15 mL benzyl alcohol and given mass of catalyst were introduced into the reactor, the reactor was sealed and purged for 5 times by O2. Then, the autoclave was pressurized to 0.3 MPa with O2 at ambient temperature. After the reaction vessel was heated to the preset temperature the stirring was set to1000 rpm to start the reaction, the oxygen reservoir was kept linking during the reaction for the purpose of replenishing the consumed oxygen. The mixture after reaction was analyzed by GC (FuLi GC9790, Zhejiang, China) equipped with FID and DM-5 column. The benzyl alcohol conversion and the TOF values were calculated as follows: X = n benzylalcohol , in - n benzylalcohol , out n benzylalcohol , in × 100 % ; TOF = n benzylalcohol , in × X ( n Au + n Pd ) × t ; ( X ⩽ 15 % ) ‘n’ is the molar mass; ‘t’ is the reaction time;"
6,Catalyst characterization,"2.5 Catalyst characterization ICP-AES was performed to quantitatively analyze the Au-Pd contents of the prepared samples on an Agilent 735-ES instrument. Before measurements, the catalysts were dissolved in aqua regia for about 24 h. An ASAP2020 instrument was applied to analyze the BET surface area, pore diameter and pore volume of the prepared samples. The BET method and t-plot methods were used to get the specific area and micropore volume. XRD was conducted on a powder diffractometer (Rigaku D/max-RC with CuKα), which was operated at 25 mA and 40 kV. The data was collected within 10–90° at a scanning speed of 8°/min. Visible Raman spectra was carried out on a Raman microscope (Renishaw in Via) at ambient temperature. TEM was conducted on an electron microscope (JEM-2100) operated at 200 kV. HAADF-STEM was carried out on a FEI Titan Cubed Themis G2 300 aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope manipulated at 300 kV. XPS was conducted on a PHI-1600ESCA spectrometer applying Mg-Kα at 1254 eV."
7,Results and discussion,"For keeping the Au:Pd molar ratio at 1:1, the nominal loadings of Pd and Au on the ACR, ACP, and ACC were respectively 0.54 wt% and 1.00 wt% The actual concentration of Au and Pd determined by ICP-AES was summarized in Table 1 , demonstrated that >90% of Au and 83% of Pd were immobilized on the supports. The difference between nominal and actual concentration further verifies the existence of metal loss in the preparation process, which might be connected with the leaching of weakly adsorbed Au-Pd during filtration or washing process in the catalyst preparation. The specific physical structural parameters of the CeO2 supports and Au-Pd/CeO2 catalysts were summarized in Table 2 . For these three kinds of CeO2, the BET surface area and the total pore volume are arranged as follows: CR > CP > CC. However, CP presented the smallest pore diameter compared to the other two carriers. It is also found that these three physical parameters (surface area, average pore diameter, and pore volume) were inhibited to different extent after loading active components, which could be related to the pore blockage by immobilization of Au and Pd NPs. XRD was conducted to analyze the structure of the prepared CeO2 supports, ACR, ACP, and ACC, the corresponding patterns were displayed in Fig. 1 . Nine prominent peaks located at 2θ = 28.5, 33.1, 47.5, 56.3, 59.1, 69.4, 76.7, 79.2, and 88.4° were detected in CR, CP and CC. These peaks should be assigned to Miller indices (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (2 2 2), (4 0 0), (3 3 1), (4 2 0), and (4 2 2) crystalline planes of the typical Cerianite structure (PDF 34-0394). The average CeO2 crystallite size of these samples were obtained by employing the Scherrer equation based on the diffraction peak information located at 28.5°, which demonstrated that the CeO2 crystallite size in CC (27.9 nm) is significantly bigger than CP (10.2 nm) and CR (7.3 nm). And, there was no significant changes of XRD patterns happened after the support of Au-Pd NPs. It might be attributed to low concentration of metal and relatively smaller Au-Pd particle size compare to the supports (Au-Pd nanoparticles size ca 2–4 nm). The above results also demonstrated that the structure of CeO2 supports, and the average particle size of CeO2 were unaffected by the loading of Au and Pd nanoparticles. It is generally accepted that Raman spectroscopy is another mean to investigate the catalyst structure, which could identify the oxygen defects on CeO2 based materials. The visible Raman was carried out to investigate the CR, CP, and CC supports before and after immobilizing Au-Pd nanoparticles. As shown in Fig. 2 , two bands were detected, the sharp peak between 462 and 465 cm−1 belonged to F2g vibration mode, the small band peaked at 598 cm−1 could be attributed to oxygen defect-induced (D) mode [18]. The CR displayed a much broader F2g peak compared to CP and CC, which further supports that CR has the smallest crystallite size analogously to the XRD results. The variation in peak linewidths of F2g mode was previously reported as the size-dependent phenomenon detected in CeO2, which could be interpreted as the phonon confinement and the inhomogeneous strain attributed to the particle size distribution [19]. According to the previous report [18], the amounts of oxygen defects on Ce-based catalysts have a positive correlation with the relative intensity ratio of ID/IF2g . For the tested CeO2 supports, ID/IF2g value decreases in the following order; CR (0.1189) > CP (0.0309) > CC (0.0184), suggesting that the amounts of oxygen defects on CeO2 is closely related to the morphologies of supports. After introducing Au-Pd nanoparticles on CeO2, no bands attributed to Au or Pd nanoparticles were detected in these samples. It is interesting that the position of the peak assigned to F2g vibration mode in Au-Pd/CeO2 catalysts was shifted to lower wavenumber from bare CeO2, which might be related to the formation of Ce-O-Au or Ce-O-Pd bonds. The ID/IF2g values of Au-Pd/CeO2 catalysts were also calculated and following the sequence; ACR (0.1329) > ACP (0.0804) > ACC (0.0649), which indicates that the amounts of oxygen defects were further enhanced compared with the pure CeO2. Unlike Raman spectra, the shift of the peak position was not detected in XRD results, which could be related to the different range of measurement between XRD and Raman scattering. The former is suitable for probing the long-range order materials and the latter is applied to examine the short-range order of crystallinity. By using Raman spectra, we confirmed that the oxygen defects and the average CeO2 particle size were intimately correlated to the different morphologies of CeO2 supported catalysts. TEM and HAADF-STEM were performed to analyze the crystal facets and morphology of the ACR, ACP, and ACC samples, together with the distribution of Au-Pd nanoparticle size. As shown in Fig. 3 , each prepared Au-Pd/CeO2 catalyst exhibits corresponding the rod, polyhedron, and cube shapes, respectively. Fig. 3a1 demonstrated TEM image of ACR with diameter of about 8 nm and the length about 40–100 nm. The regular interplanar spacing 0.27 nm of ACR was consistent with d value of {2 0 0} facet, indicating {1 0 0} facet of CeO2 was selectively exposed on ACR surface based on the HRTEM image result in Fig. 3a2. As previously reported, ceria nanorod usually grows along (1 0 0) direction with exposed {1 1 0} and {1 0 0} facets [20], which is consistent with our results. TEM and HRTEM images of ACP were exhibited in Fig. 3b. From the microscopy data we can see that the average size of ACP was about 13 nm, the spacing between lattice fringes was measured to be 0.31 nm and this value is in alignment with interplanar spacing of (1 1 1), suggesting that ACP is covered by {1 1 1} facets. In addition, microscopy results in Fig. 3c showed that the particle size of ACC was mainly distributed between 15 nm and 60 nm, two interplanar spacings of 0.31 and 0.27 nm were detected, indicating the surface of ACC was enclosed by {1 1 1} and {1 0 0} facets. Particle size distribution of AuPd nano particles on each support was characterized using HAADF-STEM. Based on measuring over 100 particles from the STEM results, it could be found that the bimetallic Au-Pd nanoparticles stay 3.05 nm in size on ACR sample. Meanwhile, ACP and ACC catalysts showed a similar Au-Pd particle size distribution compared to ACR, with the corresponding values of 3.23 nm and 2.92 nm. Therefore, it is conducted that the distribution of Au-Pd NPs on all the CeO2 supports are less affected by the support morphology and the exposed crystal facet. XPS is a surface sensitive technology which could provide quantitative and qualitative information of surface elements. In the present work, XPS was carried out to characterize the composition and chemical state of elements on the surface of Au-Pd/CeO2 catalysts. Fig. 4 a and b exhibited the XPS spectra of Au 4f and Pd 3d, respectively. As reported, the typical binding energies located at 87.7 and 84.0 eV could be attributed to the Au 4f5/2 and Au 4f7/2 signal of Au0, respectively [21]. As shown in Fig. 4a, two peaks located at 87.3 and 83.6 eV were detected on the ACR sample, which shifted to lower binding energy compared with the standard values. The similar negative shifts were also observed for ACP and ACC catalysts, which may be related to the electron transfer from CeO2 to Au and electronic decoration of Au species by combining with Pd, suggesting the existence of strong interaction between Pd and Au [4]. The electron transfer from CeO2 to Au would occur in Au-Pd/CeO2 catalysts, because the work function of CeO2 (4.69 eV) is lower than that of Au (5.31–5.47 eV) [22]. It is noteworthy that gold is mostly present as Au0 in these samples and no ionic Au species attributed to Au3+ (89.6 eV, 87.0 eV) and Au+ (88.5 eV, 84.6 eV) were detected on the prepared Au-Pd/CeO2 samples. XPS spectra of Pd 3d on the ACR, ACP, and ACC were depicted in Fig. 4b. As reported, the bands of Pd 3d could be deconvoluted into sub-peaks and the binding energies for metallic Pd (Pd0) and ionic Pd2+ species should be in the range of 334.8–336.2 eV and 336.2–338.7 eV, respectively [23]. It is clear that both metallic Pd and ionic Pd2+ were detected in the prepared ACP and ACC catalysts. However, only ionic Pd2+ could be detected in the ACR catalyst. The peaks at 337.7 and 342.9 eV are ascribed to 3d5/2and 3d3/2 orbits of ionic Pd2+, whereas the binding energies at 335.7 and 335.2 eV belong to the 3d5/2 orbits of metallic Pd0. The percentages of Pd2+ species present in Au-Pd/CeO2 catalysts were obtained by calculation of the fitting areas Pd2+/(Pd2++Pd0). Obviously, the concentrations of Pd2+ in Au-Pd/CeO2 catalysts decreased as the following order: ACR (100%) > ACP (85.9%) > ACC (76.3%). It is acknowledged that the production of ionic Pd2+ was closely related to the catalyst surface oxygen species, which could supply oxygen to the Pd particles due to the high redox property. Fig. 4c showed the Ce 3d XPS spectra in the ACR, ACP, and ACC catalysts, which could be fitted by eight sub-peaks based on the previous reports. The four peaks between 880 eV and 899 eV corresponding to v, v′, v″, and v‴ components are attributed to 3d5/2 features and the rest of four peaks between 900 eV and 918 eV labeled as u‴, u″, u′, and u are attributed to 3d5/3, respectively. Meanwhile, u‴ component is a fingerprint of Ce4+ state which does not have 4f0 state. It was known that the components u′ and v′ are characteristics of Ce3+ and u, u″, u‴, v, v″, and v‴ are characteristics of Ce4+ . The equation of Ce3+/(Ce3+ + Ce4+) was applied to calculate the Ce3+ ratios on each catalyst based on the peak area and the corresponding results were also listed in Fig. 4c. The analysis results demonstrated that Ce4+ is the dominant oxidation state in all Au-Pd/CeO2 catalysts and the Ce3+ ratio on ACR surface (14.8%) is higher than that on ACP (13.7%) and ACC (12.9%). It has been reported that two oxygen vacancies could be generated by one Ce3+, so the higher proportion of Ce3+ implies a higher amount of oxygen vacancy on the catalyst surface [24]. Thus, the above analysis has further confirmed that more oxygen vacancies existed in ACR catalyst, which fit well with the Raman’s results mentioned before. O1s XPS spectra for Au-Pd/CeO2 catalysts were displayed in Fig. 4d. The sub-band at 529.4–529.7 eV should be attributed to the lattice oxygen (marked as Oβ), another sub-band detected at 531.5 eV-531.8 eV should be due to the surface adsorbed oxygen (labeled as Oα), respectively [25]. It is assumed that the surface adsorbed oxygen shows higher mobility than lattice oxygen, Oα not only can stabilize Au-Pd nanoparticles, but also facilitate the catalytic oxidation reaction. Thereafter, the content of Oα was estimated by using Oα/(Oα + Oβ), the calculation results demonstrated that the Oα on ACR (32.4%) is higher than that on the ACP (31.4%) and ACC (31.7%) , which is in align with the sequence of Ce3+ ratios observed on the catalyst surface. The surface atomic composition derived from the XPS results was listed in Table 3 . Compared with ICP-AES results, it could be found that the concentrations of Pd on the surface of ACR, ACP, and ACC catalysts were higher than that in the corresponding bulk. In contrast, the concentration of Au detected on the catalyst surface was lower than the value in bulk. Based on the observed Pd and Au elements on the catalysts by using XPS, the molar ratios of Au/Pd were calculated and ranked by ACP > ACR > ACC. These values based on the XPS characterization were found lower than the nominal Au/Pd values, which suggests the enrichment of Pd species on CeO2 surface, the similar phenomenon was also reported by David et al, which could be assigned to the variation in XPS analysis depths between Pd and Au [15]."
8,Catalytic performance measurement,"Au-Pd bimetal immobilized on different morphologies of CeO2 were applied to investigate their reaction performance for solvent-free benzyl alcohol oxidation at 120 °C under 0.3 MPa O2. The conversion of benzyl alcohol and the selectivity to benzaldehyde on the ACR, ACP, and ACC catalysts were exhibited in Fig. 5 . The benzyl alcohol conversion over CeO2 samples and the selectivities towards other generated products, such as benzene, benzoic acid, toluene, and benzyl benzoate on the CeO2 and Au-Pd/CeO2 catalysts are also listed in Table 4 . Based on the experimental results of the present work, it is found that the primary product was benzaldehyde, which is consistent to those published works from AuPd catalysis [26,27]. Meanwhile, it also could be observed that CeO2 support alone exhibited limited catalytic activity. As showed in Fig. 5, ACR catalyst exhibited the highest benzyl alcohol conversion of 78.15% after reaction carried for 3 h. By contrast, only 55.14% and 48.84% benzyl alcohol conversion could be achieved on ACP and ACC catalysts under the identical reaction conditions. In addition, it was noteworthy that the benzyl alcohol conversion over ACC catalyst maintained almost the same after reaction for 2 h, which might be caused by the poisoning of Pd as Pd surface is saturated by benzyl aldehyde during the reaction. As it is widely reported that Pd can be easily deactivated due to the desorption problem of aldehyde products on the catalyst surface [28–31]. We suggest that Pd poisoning affected the conversion of ACC containing the highest amount of Pd (Au/Pd molar ratio of 0.26) on the catalyst surface according to XPS measurements. Fig. 5 shows that ACC displayed the highest selectivity to benzaldehyde (>92%) within 6 h reaction compared with ACR and ACP, which is well in agreement to the explained phenomenon. Therefore, different morphologies of CeO2 supports lead to a different exposed amount of Pd on the catalyst surface, which interact with reactant molecules, affecting its catalysis performance in catalytic oxidation benzyl alcohol. To further clarify the dependence between the catalytic performance and the property of catalyst structure, it is essential to calculate the turnover frequency (TOF) values for each Au-Pd/CeO2 catalyst with different morphology in the catalytic conversion of benzyl alcohol. Generally, the catalytic conversion should be controlled below 15% when calculating TOF values. Therefore, the catalytic performance of each catalyst was compared at a reaction time of 0.5 h with less amount of added catalyst into the reaction (14 mg). The TOF results were exhibited in Fig. 6 . Obviously, the highest TOF value (31,757 h−1) was obtained on the ACR catalyst (benzyl alcohol conversion: 13.86%). While the ACP and ACC catalysts exhibited relatively lower catalytic activity with TOF values of 27,226 h−1 (benzyl alcohol conversion: 14.83%) and 10,339 h−1 (benzyl alcohol conversion: 4.55%) under the corresponding experimental conditions. Based on all the characterization results and the catalytic activities tests, it could be inferred that the performances of Au-Pd/CeO2 catalysts in solvent-free benzyl alcohol oxidation are indeed closely related to their physico-chemical properties from the different morphologies of the supports."
9,Conclusion,"In conclusion, Au-Pd NPs were immobilized on CeO2 with diverse morphologies through deposition-precipitation method, benzyl alcohol was used as the probe molecule for investigating catalytic activities over each catalyst under solvent-free condition. The results of characterization and catalytic performance tests demonstrated that the catalytic activities for Au-Pd/CeO2 in benzyl alcohol oxidation were largely dependent on CeO2 morphologies, a rod-shape structure in the catalyst support (ACR) is more favoured compared with structures of polyhedrons (ACP) and cube (ACC). Series of characterization results of XRD, Raman, TEM, HAADF-STEM and XPS indicate that CeO2 support of rod structure contains a higher concentration of oxygen defects, especially for Oα, a higher number of Ce3+ and Pd2+ on the catalyst surface, all these characters have played important roles in solvent-free benzyl alcohol oxidation."
