0,Introduction,"Lignocellulosic biomass is an important alternative of fossil resource for manufacturing valuable oxygen-containing chemicals. Levulinic acid (LA), as a platform chemical that can be further converted to γ-valerolactone (GVL) [1,2] and 1,4-pentanediol [3,4] (1,4-PDO), can be obtained by the hydrolysis of renewable biomass [5]. Both GVL and 1,4-PDO are valuable raw material for manufacturing the fine chemicals such as 2-methyltetrahydrofuran [6,7], pentanol [8], valeric acid [9,10], valeric esters [11], alkanes [12], and polymer precursor [13], which are used as fuel, fuel addictive or intermediates in polymer industry [14]. Thus, how to selectively convert LA to GVL or 1,4-PDO is of great importance to bridge the production chain from biomass to the fine chemicals. The production of GVL from levulinic acid or esters can be achieved via the hydrogenation and lactonization routes [15]. The carbonyl group in levulinic acid or esters can be firstly hydrogenated to hydroxyl group to form the reaction intermediate, 4-hydroxypentanoic acid or its esters, as is shown in Scheme 1 , and then GVL is further produced via the lactonization of the reaction intermediates [16]. This process needs the involvement of hydrogenation sites for the hydrogenation reactions and other active sites such as acidic sites for the lactonization [17]. The GVL formed can be converted to 1,4-PDO via the further hydrogenolysis [4]. Therefore, the production of 1,4-PDO from levulinic acid/esters is consecutive reactions with GVL formed as the intermediate product. The selectivity towards GVL or 1,4-PDO depends on the specific catalytic performance of the catalysts for the elementary reactions including hydrogenation, lactonization and ring-opening of GVL, which are closely related to the formulation of catalyst, or rather, the distribution of hydrogenation sites, acidic/basic sites, and the characteristics of pore structures, etc. Noble metal catalysts, including Ru [18,19], Au [20], Pd [21,22], and Pt [23,24] etc. were developed for the conversion of levulinic acid/esters to GVL, but increasing attention should also been paid on the conversion of GVL to 1,4-PDO. Noble metal catalysts are costly in manufacturing, while the non-noble metal catalysts, including Cu [25–27], Co [28,29], and Ni [30,31] were also reported to be active for the conversion of LA or GVL to 1,4-PDO [32], and they are much cheaper. Thus, it is practically more important to develop the transition metal-based catalysts for producing GVL or 1,4-PDO from levulinic acid or esters. Cu catalysts have been reported to be effective for the hydrogenation of levulinic acid to GVL or 1,4-PDO [1,4,6,32–35]. Cobalt or nickel catalysts could also be considered as the alternative of Cu-based catalysts, as cobalt and nickel are also active for hydrogenation reactions [28–31]. For example, Ni-MoOx/Al2O3 and W-Ni/TiO2 catalysts were synthesized by varied research groups, and they both achieved the conversion of GVL to 1,4-PDO and/or 2-methyltetrahydrofuran [7,30]. The silica-supported cobalt catalysts were prepared for hydrogenation of LA to GVL and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran at 200 °C and 225 °C, respectively [36], while 1,4-PDO was produced as the minor by-product. In addition, Cen et al. developed the Co/ZrO2 catalysts for the conversion of ethyl levulinate (EL) to GVL (94%), 1,4-PDO (78%) and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (77%) at 190 – 230 °C [8]. The yield of 1,4-PDO was moderate and reaction temperature was relatively high. Thus, there is still room for development of the Co-based catalysts with high activity at low reaction temperatures. As for the factors determining the selectivity to GVL and 1,4-PDO, in addition to the hydrogenation sites from metals, the acidic or basic sites dispersed in carrier could also affect the catalytic activity. To flexibly adjust the selectivity to GVL and 1,4-PDO, the carrier with tunable acidic or basic sites and porous structures should be considered. Layered double hydroxides (LDH) could be used as the precursor of carrier to create abundant acidic and basic sites, and facilitate the highly dispersed metallic particles due to the developed porous structures and interaction between metallic species and the carrier [37]. Herein, the Co-based catalysts derived from LDH could obtain the bi-functional hydrogenation catalysts with Co species for catalyzing the hydrogenation, and acidic sites for catalyzing the lactonization and ring-opening process. Co-based catalysts with LDH as the precursor were synthesized and used for the selective hydrogenation of EL to GVL or 1,4-PDO (Scheme 1). The introduction of Al species in Co-based catalysts improved the catalytic activity for the conversion of EL to ethyl 4-hydroxyvalerate, the lactonization of ethyl 4-hydroxyvalerate to GVL and the conversion of GVL to 1,4-PDO. The activation energy of various reaction processes was determined based on the kinetic analysis, and the conversion of GVL controlled the production of 1,4-PDO from EL. The synergy between the hydrogenation sites and acidic sites, generated from Al species, could accelerate the conversion of GVL to produce 1,4-PDO with a high yield over Co-Mg-Al and Co-Al than Co-Mg. The adsorption of oxygen-containing functionalities over Lewis acidic sites, the enhanced conversion of the reaction intermediates and GVL over Brønsted acidic sites, and the activation of hydrogen over metallic Co accelerated the overall reaction rates, achieving the high yield of GVL (98%) in water and the high yield of 1,4-PDO (98%) in isopropanol."

EL, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran (THF), isopropanol, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), sodium dydroxide (NaOH), cobalt nitrate [Co(NO3)2⋅6H2O], light magnesium oxide (MgO) and magnesium nitrate [Mg(NO3)2⋅6H2O] were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. D008, a commercial sulfonic acid resin solid acid catalyst, was purchased from Cary Environmental Technology Co., Ltd (China). All chemicals are analytical grade and were used directly."
3,Catalyst synthesis,"2.2 Catalyst synthesis Co-Mg-Al catalysts with different elemental formulations (Co, Mg and Al) were synthesized by a co-precipitation method. A mixed aqueous solution containing both Co(NO3)2 and Mg(NO3)2 (the total concentration of cobalt and magnesium salts was 0.75 mol/L) was prepared, concentration of which was triple to that of Al(NO3)3. The detailed preparation procedure of LDH precursor of Co-Mg-Al catalysts followed the previous study [37]. The LDH precursor was further calcined at 600 °C for 4 h in muffle furnace, and then the calcined samples were reduced at 600 and 750 °C in a mixture of N2 and H2 (flow rate of both of them: 60/60 mL/min), respectively. With regard to Co-Mg (the concentration of Co2+ and Mg2+ was all 0.25 mol/L) and Co-Al (the concentration of Co2+ and Al3+ was all 0.25 mol/L), they were also prepared following the synthesis procedure of Co-Mg-Al catalysts."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test The catalytic experiments were conducted in an autoclave reactor with a stirring speed of 600 rpm. Before the test, the reactants, solvents and catalyst were loaded into the reactor. Purging was performed by pressurized hydrogen, and then the reactor was charged with pressurized hydrogen. The reactor was maintained at the reaction temperature for a specific reaction time, and then the liquid products and the catalysts were collected for further analysis. A gas chromatography coupling with a mass spectrometer (GC–MS, Shimadzu GC–MS-QP 2020) was used for the quantitative calculation of liquid products, and the detailed instrument parameter and operating procedure followed our previous study [4]. The conversion of reactants and the yield of targeting products were calculated following Eqs. (1 and 2). The turn over frequency (TOF) for the conversion of GVL over Co-based catalysts was calculated. TOF and TOFacidic sites were calculated with Eqs. (3 and 4), respectively. (1) Conversion % = Mole of reactant converted Mole of reactant loaded × 100 % (2) Yield % = Mole of targeting product produced Mole of reactant loaded × 100 % (3) TOF h - 1 = Mole of GVL converted Mole of metal × dispersion × reaction time (4) TOF acidic sites h - 1 = Mole of GVL converted Mole of acidic sites × reaction time"
5,Catalysts characterizations,"2.4 Catalysts characterizations Co-based catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction spectrometer (XRD, Rigaku Ultima IV), N2 adsorption-desorption measurement (Biaode SSA-6000 instrument, China), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM 2100 plus), temperature programmed reduction in hydrogen (H2-TPR, Vodo VDSorb 91x instrument made in China), temperature programmed desorption using H2 as the probing molecule (H2-TPD), temperature programmed desorption (Biaode PCA-1200 instrument) with CO2 or NH3 as the probing molecule (CO2-TPD or NH3-TPD). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on a Perkin-Elmer PHI pectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV) source by ESCALAB 250 (Thermo Electron). The crystalline size of metallic Co (d(Co0)) was calculated as follows: d(Co0) = 96/dispersion (Co) [8]. The operating procedure of mentioned characterization methods followed the previous studies [37,38]. In-situ Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was employed by using a Nicolet iS50 spectrometer equipped with a modified Harrick Praying Mantis DRIFT cell to investigate the reaction mechanism for the hydrogenation of levulinic acid. Before the analysis, the reduced samples were loaded in the cell, and the reaction substrate was added dropwise on the surface of the sample. Afterwards, the samples were heated to 200 °C with a ramping rate of 10 °C/min and maintained for 20 min at this temperature. H2 (50 mL/min) was fed for the occurrence of the hydrogenation. During this process, the spectra were recorded simultaneously with the interval of every 7 s. Pyridine-FTIR was also performed by using the same instrument. The samples were pretreated at 150 °C for 30 min in a N2 flow (80 mL/min), and then pyridine was introduced in a N2 flow for 1 h. After that, N2 was used for removing the physically adsorbed pyridine for 30 min, and then the pyridine-FTIR spectra were recorded. The adsorption of GVL over different samples, such as MgO, Al2O3 and LTMS, was performed by using DRIFTS. Typically, the samples were pretreated at 150 °C in a N2 flow (80 mL/min) for 20 min. After that, GVL was introduced for the adsorption on the surface of samples at 150 °C for 30 min, and then the purging of samples was performed in a N2 flow for 30 min. Finally, the spectra were recorded."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterizations of the catalysts,"3.1 Characterizations of the catalysts 3.1.1 X-ray diffraction Fig. 1 (a) shows that the catalysts derived from the different precursors showed the different diffraction patterns. The LDH structure, including magnesium aluminum hydroxide hydrate (JCPDS 35-0965) and cobalt aluminum hydroxide hydrate (JCPDS 51-0045), was observed in Co-Mg-Al and Co-Al, and only Mg(OH)2 (JCPDS 86-0441) was formed in the precursor of the Co-Mg catalyst, which might further affect the dispersion of metallic Co particles. After the calcination, MgO was observed in Co-Mg catalyst, and Co3O4 was formed in all samples, except for 0.9Co-2.1 Mg-Al catalyst due to the low Co content, as is shown in Table S1. Different reduction temperatures were employed for the reduction of cobalt oxides. Fig. 1(c and d) show the diffraction peaks of the Co-based catalysts reduced at 600 and 750 °C, respectively. The reduction at 600 °C could not achieve the complete reduction of cobalt oxides in the Co-Mg-Al catalysts, as the strong interaction of metallic Co with the carrier was present. Table 1 shows that the particle size of metallic Co in Co-Mg-Al catalysts was slightly lower than that in Co-Al and while was much lower than Co-Mg catalyst, indicating that Mg-Al LDH as the precursor suppressed the sintering of Co particles during the calcination and reduction. The various compositions of the catalyst might affect the microstructure of catalysts, which was also investigated. 3.1.2 Transmission electron microscope The obvious sintering of Co species was observed in Co-Mg catalyst (Fig. 2 a), as evidenced by the highest Co particle size. The Co-Mg-Al catalysts with the Co content of 19.1% and 30.5% (Table S1) showed the layer structure derived from LDH precursor (Fig. 2b and c) [38], and Co particles were highly dispersed across the surface of carrier. When the Mg content in Co-Mg-Al catalysts decreased, no obvious layer structure was observed, indicating the necessity of co-presence of Mg and Al for maintaining the layer structure even after calcination and reduction. Besides, the slight sintering of Co species was also observed in Co-Al and 2.1Co-0.9 Mg-Al catalysts due to the high Co content. The particles size of various Co-based catalysts detected by the TEM analysis in Table 1 was consistent with that from the XRD results (Fig. 1d and Table 1). In addition, the results of HRTEM indicated that the interlayer spacing of ca. 2.04 Å belonged to the exposed (111) facet of Co, as is shown in Fig. 2(f), indicating that the lattice planes of Co (111) were exposed and acted as hydrogenation sites. Furthermore, the distribution of elemental Co was also further measured, as is shown in Fig. S1. Elemental mapping of Co indicated that highly homogeneous distribution of Co was observed, which also confirmed the high dispersion of metallic Co in the 1.5Co-1.5 Mg-Al. In addition, the effects of various precursors of Co-based catalysts on specific surface area and porous structure were further investigated. 3.1.3 N2 physical adsorption/desorption The higher specific surface area was observed in Co-Mg-Al catalysts rather than Co-Mg, and the surface area gradually decreased with the decreasing Mg content. Mg was essential for the formation of the LDH structures [4]. Co-Mg-Al and Co-Al catalysts exhibited a lower pore size than Co-Mg, as they possessed the developed porous structures. Fig. 3 (a) shows that the isotherms of all samples were assigned to a type IV isotherm, and the hysteresis loops were H3-type. The relative pressure of isotherm ranged from 0.8 to 1.0, indicating the formation of mesoporous structures. The pores distribution located in the range of 2 to 40 nm, confirming the formation of mesoporosity in samples [39]. With the increasing Co content, the pore size became more concentrated (Fig. 3b). 3.1.4 Temperature programmed reduction in hydrogen Fig. 3(c) shows that all samples exhibited two reduction peaks. The reduction peak of Co3+ to Co2+ was observed at a low temperature region, and the peak at a high temperature belonged to the reduction of Co2+ to Co0 [40]. Co-Mg catalyst exhibited the lowest reduction temperatures owing to the weak interaction of Co species with the MgO carrier. Co-Mg-Al and Co-Al catalysts exhibited a much higher reduction temperature, as the strong interaction of Al species with the cobalt oxides was present in these catalysts. In addition, Mg-Al LDH as the precursor faciliated the high dispersion of cobalt oxides, which was also beneficial for the dispersion and contact of cobalt species with Al species, making cobalt more difficult to be reduced. Therefore, the catalyst reduced at 600 °C could not achieve the full reduction of Co3O4 to metallic Co particles. With the increasing Co content in Co-Mg-Al catalysts, the reduction temperature decreased gradually, as the Co particles with a big size were inclined to be reduced easier than that with a small size due to the less sufficiently contact with the support. In addition, the reduction degree was also determined, as shown in Table S1. Co-Mg-Al catalysts exhibited a lower reduction degree, as more abundant porous structure and the strong interaction of Co species with the carrier made the reduction of the cobalt oxides more difficult. This was also evidenced from another aspect by the higher reduction degree of Co-Mg and Co-Al that possessed smaller specific area and bigger pore size. The dispersion of metallic Co species in various catalysts was also investigated. 3.1.5 Temperature programmed desorption of H2 Fig. 3(d) shows that the temperatures of desorption peaks were centered at 50 to 300 °C, which could belong to the desorption of adsorbed hydrogen on the surface of catalysts, and the amount of metallic Co sites was also calculated (Table 2 , Entries 1 to 5). Co-Mg and Co-Al with a higher Co content (Table S1, Entries 1 and 5) also naturally exhibited more metallic Co sites (Table 2, Entries 1 and 5). The 2.1Co-0.9 Mg-Al with a higher Co content and surface area showed the highest amount of metallic Co sites compared to other catalysts. The Co-Mg without LDH as the precursor possessed a comparable amount of metallic Co sites with Co-Mg-Al and Co-Al. A lower amount of metallic Co sites was observed in 0.9Co-2.1 Mg-Al and 1.5Co-1.5 Mg-Al catalysts with a lower Co content. In addition, the dispersion of Co0 and crystallite size of Co0 were also calculated, as shown in Table 2. Co-Mg-Al catalysts exhibited a higher dispersion of metallic Co and a smaller crystallite size of Co0 than Co-Mg and Co-Al, indicating that the strong interaction of Co species with the carrier facilitated the dispersion of metallic Co and, as indicated by the XRD analysis (Table 1 and 7). The Co-based catalysts reduced at 600 °C were also characterized by H2-TPD. Table S1 and Fig. S2 indicated that the strong interaction of metallic Co with the carrier containing Al species made the reduction of the cobalt oxides in Co-Al and Co-Mg-Al difficult at a low reaction temperature. A higher amount of metallic Co sites was observed in Co-Mg, which was higher than that in Co-Mg-Al and Co-Al catalysts (Table S1, Entries 1 to 5), as shown in Fig. 1(c) and Fig. 3(c). The desorption temperature of hydrogen over the Co-Mg-Al and Co-Al catalysts shifted to a higher temperature range (Fig. S2), which could be due to the desorption of spill-over hydrogen over cobalt oxides [41]. In addition to metallic Co sites, acidity and basicity of catalysts were also investigated. 3.1.6 Temperature programmed desorption of NH3 or CO2 and pyridine-FTIR Acidities of the Co-based catalysts were determined by the NH3-TPD analysis, as shown in Fig. 4 (a) and Table 3 . Co-Mg-Al and Co-Al catalysts exhibited more acidic sites than Co-Mg due to the presence of Al in catalysts. The calcined Mg-Al LDH facilitated the generation of more pores, and thus more acidic sites were exposed. The results of pyridine-FTIR showed that the absorption peaks at 1439 and 1544 cm−1 belonged to the Lewis and Brønsted acidic sites (Fig. 4b) [4], respectively. The peak of the sum of Lewis and Brønsted acidic sites was observed at 1481 cm−1 [4]. Co-Mg showed a lower amount of acidic sites, and the ratio of Brønsted to Lewis acidic sites in Co-Mg catalysts was also lower than that in 2.1Co-0.9 Mg-Al and Co-Al catalysts. The presence of Al in Co-based catalysts created more Brønsted acidic sites. In comparison, Mg as base metal could affect the formation of basic sites (Fig. S3 and Table S2). Co-Mg-Al catalysts with abundant Mg species and a high surface area exhibited abundant basic sites, the intrinsic abundance of which related to the content of MgO [42], while their exposure was determined by their specific area (Table 1, Entries 1 to 4). The Co-Al showed the lowest abundance of basic sites than Co-Mg-Al and Co-Mg catalysts due the absence of Mg in catalyst (Table S2, Entries 1 to 5). The various elemental compositions in Co-based catalysts could further affect the present form of Co species, which was further investigated. 3.1.7 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy To further investigate the surface distribution of elements and valence state of Co species, the Co-based catalysts were characterized by XPS. Fig. 5 shows that Co2+ of Co2p3/2 and 2p1/2 was observed at ca. 783.0 and 800.0 eV [43], which originated from the passivating treatment after the reduction of catalysts. Co0 of Co2p3/2 and 2p1/2 was observed at ca. 777.8 and 793.0 eV [41,44]. Thus, Co species in Co-based catalysts were present with the metallic oxide forms of CoO and metallic Co. The relative ratio of Co0/Co2+ was further calculated, as shown in Table S3. The Co-Al catalyst exhibited the highest ratio of Co0/Co2+, and the presence of Al in Co-based catalysts could suppress the oxidation of metallic Co, due to the strong interaction of Co species with the carrier. The presence of the Co0 species and acidic sites on the surface of catalyst was necessary as it could act as the active sites, and the effects of which on the catalytic activity for the conversion of levulinic acid/esters were further investigated."
8,Catalytic activity,"3.2 Catalytic activity 3.2.1 Influence of reaction temperature Table 4 shows the distribution of products versus the various reaction temperatures. The conversion of EL did not reach 100% over Co-Mg, 0.9Co-2.1 Mg-Al and 1.5Co-1.5 Mg-Al catalysts at 120 °C. Although the complete conversion of EL was achieved over Co-Al and 2.1Co-0.9 Mg-Al, the yield of GVL was not high (Table 4, Entries 1 to 5). The reaction intermediate, such as ethyl 4-hydroxyvalerate, was not further converted to GVL via the lactonization process. The lactonization of ethyl 4-hydroxyvalerate might control the reaction rate for the conversion of EL to GVL, which will be further investigated. 0.9Co-2.1 Mg-Al and 1.5Co-1.5 Mg-Al catalysts with a low Co content exhibited the inferior catalytic activity to Co-Al due to the lack of enough hydrogenation sites (Table S1, Entries 2 and 3), as metallic cobalt species were the main active sites for hydrogenation of the carbonyl functionality in EL [28]. However, even though the Co-Mg catalyst reduced at 600 °C showed a higher amount of hydrogenation sites, but the conversion of EL was only 64% at a low reaction temperature (Table 4, Entry 1). The increasing reaction temperature could facilitate the formation of GVL via the hydrogenation and lactonization. The conversion of EL reached 100% over the catalysts, except for the 0.9Co-2.1 Mg-Al catalyst that had the lowest content of cobalt. A higher GVL yield was also obtained over Co-Mg catalyst than that over Co-Al and 2.1Co-0.9 Mg-Al catalysts (Table 4, Entry 6). The presence of Al in the catalyst formulation was not beneficial for the formation of GVL at a low reaction temperature. Co-Mg catalyst had abundant hydrogenation sites, achieving a higher catalytic performance for the production of GVL. The reaction intermediates were further converted to GVL with a higher yield at 180 °C (Table 4, Entries 11 to 15). Reaction temperature was of great importance for the occurrence of the lactonization to produce GVL. In addition, 1,4-PDO yield was still very low even though the reaction temperature increased from 120 to 180 °C. The further ring-opening of GVL was very difficult in ethanol medium. Other reaction conditions need to be investigated to facilitate the conversion of GVL. 3.2.2 Influence of reaction solvents and hydrogen pressure Table 5 shows the effects of the reaction mediums with various properties on the conversion of EL. Compared with ethanol as the solvent, the use of water could achieve a higher GVL yield over the Co-based catalysts (Table 5, Entries 1 to 5), and the highest yield of GVL came to 98% over the Co-Mg catalyst (Table 5, Entry 1). Water, which has a lower hydrogen solubility [38], as the solvent could enhance the H-spillover effect on the catalyst surface [45]. This accelerated the reaction rate of levulinic acid or esters in water than that in isopropanol or tetrahydrofuran. Water could also enhance the adsorption of reactant and reaction intermediates, resulting in a higher conversion of ethyl levulinate and a higher yield of GVL [45,46]. However, water could not benefit the conversion of GVL, as a higher free energy for the conversion of GVL was confirmed in water than other alcohol solvents [45], indicating the limitation of water for the conversion of GVL to 1,4-PDO. The ring-opening of GVL occurred, producing more 1,4-PDO especially over the Co-Al and 2.1Co-0.9 Mg-Al catalysts with simultaneously both more acidic sites and metallic cobalt sites (Table 5, Entries 6 to 10). Further to this, the higher hydrogen solubility of THF also facilitated the conversion of GVL to 1,4-PDO [38]. When isopropanol, a solvent with a higher hydrogen solubility, was used, the similar result was obtained. GVL produced was further converted to 1,4-PDO (Table 5, Entries 11 to 15). Co-Al catalyst reduced at 600 °C exhibited a higher 1,4-PDO yield again. In addition, the elevated hydrogen pressure benefited the conversion of GVL to produce 1,4-PDO (Table 5, Entries 16 to 20). The Co-based catalysts reduced at 750 °C could also facilitate the conversion of GVL to 1,4-PDO (Table 5, Entries 21 to 25), as more metallic cobalt species were exposed for catalyzing the ring-opening reactions via the hydrogenolysis. Nevertheless, the 1,4-PDO yield was not high enough and other reaction parameters should be further optimized. 3.2.3 Influence of essential reaction parameters on ring-opening of GVL Table 6 shows that the increasing catalyst loading benefited the further conversion of GVL to 1,4-PDO when compared with the results in Table 5. The yield of GVL increased with the prolonging reaction time, but it was not significant over the catalysts reduced at 600 °C (Table 6, Entry 1 to 10). The reduction of the Co-based catalysts at 750 °C could remarkably enhance the catalytic selectivity of 1,4-PDO. 2.1Co-0.9 Mg-Al catalyst showed the 1,4-PDO yield close to 90% (Table 6, Entry 14). More exposed metallic cobalt species in the catalyst with the porous structure are clearly important for accelerating the formation of 1,4-PDO. In addition, reaction time was further prolonged to 10 h, and Co-based catalysts reduced at 750 °C even showed the higher yield of 1,4-PDO (98%, Table 6, Entry 24). The existing results showed that a higher 1,4-PDO yield was observed over Co-Mg-Al and Co-Al catalysts compared to the Co-Mg, indicating that the catalyst with a smaller Co particles size and more hydrogenation and acidic sites benefited the ring-opening of GVL. The porous structure of the catalyst is not the only determining factor as the 0.9Co-2.1 Mg-Al catalyst with the developed porous structure and the Co-Mg catalyst with a bigger pore size also showed a low activity for the formation of 1,4-PDO. The above results also indicated that the ring-opening of GVL controlled the production rate of 1,4-PDO from EL. In addition, other starting reactants, LA and isopropyl levulinate, were also further investigated. When LA was used, the yield of 1,4-PDO was higher than that using EL as the reactant, as LA itself is acidic, which might benefit the formation and conversion of GVL to 1,4-PDO (Table 6, Entries 6 to10 vs Table S4, Entries 1 to 5) [47]. In addition, steric hindrance should also be considered, as the use of isopropyl levulinate, a molecule with a bigger molecular skeleton, exhibited a lower 1,4-PDO yield compared to EL as the reactant (Table S4, Entries 6 to 10). Further to this, in terms of the steric hindrance, the porous structures of the catalyst also matter. The 1,4-PDO yield from LA over Co-Mg catalyst was higher than 2.1Co-0.9 Mg-Al catalyst, which was probably due to its bigger pore size (Table S4, Entries 1 and 4 vs Table 6, Entries 6 and 9). In addition, the catalytic activity of the 2.1Co-0.9 Mg-Al for the hydrogenation of levulinic acid/esters was compared with the previous references. As is shown in Table S5, both noble and non-noble metal catalysts were used for the conversion of levulinic acid or esters to GVL and 1,4-PDO [4,7,8,33,34,45–55], Co-Mg-Al catalyst synthesized in this study showed a higher reactant conversion and GVL yield (97%) than those in most of the previous references. However, the reaction conditions developed in this study were milder and the reaction time was also shorter in water. In addition, the 1,4-PDO yield in this study was also higher than that over most of the previously developed catalysts, indicating that Co-Mg-Al catalysts derived from the Mg-Al LDH could maintain the superior activity for the selective hydrogenation of EL to GVL or to 1,4-PDO via switching the catalysts and the reaction conditions."
9,Kinetic analysis for hydrogenation of EL,"3.3 Kinetic analysis for hydrogenation of EL Hydrogenation of EL, the lactonization of ethyl 4-hydroxyvalerate, and the ring-opening of GVL are important reaction steps for producing 1,4-PDO from EL, which were selected for the kinetic evaluation of the rate-determining steps over the 2.1Co-0.9 Mg-Al catalyst. The conversion of various reactants versus reaction time and Arrhenius figures for hydrogenation of EL, the lactonization of ethyl 4-hydroxyvalerate and the ring-opening of GVL are shown in Fig. 6 . The conversion of various reactants increased linearly from 110 to 170 °C, and the reaction rate constants of the various reaction steps were also calculated, as shown in Table 7 . The reaction rate constants for the conversion of ethyl levulinate were always higher than that of ethyl 4-hydroxyvalerate and GVL (Table 7, Entries 1 to 4). Obviously, the hydrogenation of EL was easier than the lactonization of ethyl 4-hydroxyvalerate and was much easier than the ring-opening of GVL, as evidenced by the much higher conversion and reaction rate constant. The corresponding activation energies are shown in Fig. 6(d). The apparent activation energy of ring-opening of GVL was 84.0 kJ/mol, which was obviously higher than that of the lactonization of ethyl 4-hydroxyvalerate (78.0 kJ/mol) and the hydrogenation of EL (63.5 kJ/mol). Therefore, it can be concluded that the ring-opening of GVL was the rate-determining step for the production of 1,4-PDO from EL, and the lactonization of ethyl 4-hydroxyvalerate controlled the total reaction rate of the production of GVL from EL, as is shown in Scheme 2 . The GVL yield of 98% was achieved over the Co-Mg catalyst in water (Table 5, Entry 1), and the 1,4-PDO yield of 98% was obtained over the 2.1Co-0.9 Mg-Al catalyst (Table 6, Entry 24). Herein, the Co-based catalysts that showed the high GVL and 1,4-PDO yields must exhibit the superior activity towards the lactonization of ethyl 4-hydroxyvalerate and the ring-opening of GVL, the two key steps for the conversion of EL to 1,4-PDO. For example, Co-Mg-Al and Co-Al catalysts achieved a higher GVL yield than that over the Co-Mg catalyst (Table 6, Entries 11 to 15, and Entries 22 to 25). Presence of Al in Co-based catalysts also facilitated the ring-opening of GVL to 1,4-PDO, as the TOF value for the conversion of GVL increased with the increasing of the abundance of Al species (Table 2). The lactonization of ethyl 4-hydroxyvalerate and the conversion of GVL could be mainly affected by the distribution of acidic and hydrogenation sites. Herein, the catalyst should be more active for the conversion of GVL by containing abundant hydrogenation and acidic sites to accelerate the formation of 1,4-PDO from EL."
10,"Roles of acidic sites and hydrogenation sites in conversion of EL to 1,4-PDO","3.4 Roles of acidic sites and hydrogenation sites in conversion of EL to 1,4-PDO The co-catalysts, including D008 (a sulfonic acid resin catalyst, containing Brønsted acidic sites) and LTMS (including Lewis acidic sites), together with the 2.1Co-0.9 Mg-Al were used for the conversion of EL to 1,4-PDO. When only 2.1Co-0.9 Mg-Al was used as the catalyst, the sum yields of GVL and 1,4-PDO were low, and the reaction intermediate (ethyl 4-hydroxyvalerate) was maintained in the reaction medium with a high abundance and was not further converted to GVL (Table S6, Entry 1). However, when D008, containing exclusively Brønsted acidic sites, was used together with 2.1Co-0.9 Mg-Al, and the reaction intermediate was converted to GVL and further to 1,4-PDO. Nevertheless, the increasing loading of D008 could suppress the conversion of GVL, maintaining a higher yield of GVL (Table S6, Entries 1 to 3). Brønsted acidic sites could thus facilitate the lactonization of ethyl 4-hydroxyvalerate to GVL and the subsequent conversion of GVL, but the amount of Brønsted acidic sites should be carefully restrained. When LTMS was used, the yield of GVL was also enhanced (Table S6, Entries 4 and 5). MgO could not facilitate the conversion of GVL, maintaining GVL as the main product (Table S6, Entry 6), indicating that acidic sites played the important roles in facilitating the lactonization reaction of ethyl 4-hydroxyvalerate and the conversion of GVL to 1,4-PDO. The presence of abundant basic sites could lower the availability of acidic sites, resulting in the decreasing 1,4-PDO yield. Pyridine was also added to poison the acidic sites, and the lactonization of ethyl 4-hydroxyvalerate and the further ring-opening of GVL were suppressed owing to the deactivation of acidic sites (Table S6, Entry 7). When benzoic acid was used to poison the basic sites on surface of the catalyst, GVL was maintained as the main product and was not further converted to 1,4-PDO (Table S6, Entry 8). Excessive Brønsted acidic sites suppressed the ring-opening of GVL to 1,4-PDO, producing other by-products. GVL was also used as the reactant, and Brønsted acidic sites could also facilitate the conversion of GVL to 1,4-PDO (Table S6, Entries 10 and 11), but the amount of Brønsted acidic sites should be restrained. When more Brønsted acidic sites was present, the ring-opening of GVL could be suppressed and the by-products could form. On the contrary, using LTMS as the co-catalyst accelerated the conversion of GVL to 1,4-PDO (Table S6, Entries 12 and 13), indicating that both Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites could facilitate the ring-opening of GVL. Brønsted acidic sites could also facilitate the lactonization of ethyl 4-hydroxyvalerate. MgO as the co-catalyst, however, lowered the activity of 2.1Co-0.9 Mg-Al for the conversion of GVL (Table S6, Entry 14), which might be due to the reason that basic sites lowered the availability of acidic sites. When acidic sites in 2.1Co-0.9 Mg-Al were poisoned by pyridine, conversion of GVL was suppressed and 1,4-PDO was difficult to be formed (Table S6, Entry 15). Benzoic acid was used to poison the basic sites and also to provide more Brønsted acidic sites, but the excess of which suppressed the conversion of GVL (Table S6, Entry 16), increasing the chance for forming by-products. The commercial Al2O3, MgO and LTMS catalysts were also used for investigating the adsorption of GVL on catalysts, as shown in Fig. S4. The functional groups of GVL could be observed over Al2O3 and LTMS catalysts, but not on MgO, indicating that Lewis acidic sites enhanced the adsorption of GVL. MgO as the co-catalyst could neutralize the acidic sites, and GVL produced thus could not be further converted. The TOF was further calculated based on the conversion of GVL over Co-based catalysts, as shown in Table 2. The introduction of Al into Co-based catalysts enhanced the ratio of Co0/Co2+ (Table S3), and also the ratio of Brønsted to Lewis acidic sites (Table 3), which accelerated the conversion of GVL and increased the TOF value for the conversion of GVL (Table 2, Entries 1, 4 and 5). The relationship between acidic and hydrogenation sites was summarized based on the TOF values of both acidic and hydrogenation sites, as is shown in Fig. 7 . With increasing amount of hydrogenation sites, TOFacidic sites increased linearly, indicating that hydrogenation sites could cooperate with acidic sites for the conversion of GVL to 1,4-PDO [56]. However, the TOFhydrogenation sites (the TOF based on the abundance of metallic Co) firstly increased linearly and then lowered when the amount of acidic sites increased monotonously (Fig. 7b), which was also confirmed in Table S6. More acidic sites could result in the strong adsorption of reactants or reaction intermediate and facilitated the formation of by-products, which could suppress the consecutive reaction for the conversion of GVL to 1,4-PDO. Therefore, the synergy between acidic and hydrogenation sites could be confirmed. The co-presence of acidic and hydrogenation sites could facilitate the lactonization of reaction intermediates to GVL and the subsequent ring-opening of GVL to 1,4-PDO."
11,In-situ Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform spectroscopy study and proposed reaction mechanism,"3.5 In-situ Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform spectroscopy study and proposed reaction mechanism Fig. 8 , Fig. S5 and Table S7 show that the absorption peaks at 3521, 1773, 1169, 1120, 1056, and 940 cm−1 were assigned to OH, CO, C-O-C, C-O in primary alcohol, C-O in secondary alcohol and OH in LA [7,57,58], respectively. The change of these functional groups was observed at a higher temperature, due to the occurrence of the hydrogenation reactions, etc. The relative abundance of the various functional groups was summarized in Table S7. The Co-Mg catalyst without the presence of Al species showed a lower relative ratio of other functional groups to the CO group than 2.1Co-0.9 Mg-Al and Co-Al catalysts (Table S7, Entries 1 to 15). With regard to the ratios of C-O-C or C-O in primary or secondary alcohol to CO, 2.1Co-0.9 Mg-Al catalyst exhibited the much higher ratios than that over Co-Mg, and the presence of Al species created more Lewis acidic sites, which facilitated the adsorption of oxygen-containing functionalities. C-O-C and C-O groups were present in GVL and 1,4-PDO, and the higher ratio of these groups showed a higher reaction rate for the hydrogenation of levulinic acid/esters to reaction intermediates, and the subsequent lactonization process and the ring-opening of GVL. The stronger adsorption of reactants and reaction intermediates on the surface of the catalysts with the introduction of Al species could be responsible for the superior activity for producing GVL or 1,4-PDO. Therefore, even though the lactonization of the reaction intermediates and the hydrogenolysis of GVL possessed higher apparent activation energy, but the synergy between hydrogenation sites and the acidic sites produced from Al species could facilitate these reaction processes. The proposed reaction mechanism and the roles of hydrogenation and acidic sites for the catalytic hydrogenation of levulinic acid/esters were shown in Scheme 3 . Typically, levulinic acid or esters was firstly adsorbed on the surface of catalyst, and H2 was activated over metallic Co. The C-O-C or OH in levulinic ester or LA could be adsorbed by Lewis acidic sites generated mainly from Al species, which could further accelerate the hydrogenation of CO group in reactant. After that, the Brønsted acidic sites acted facilitated the lactonization of reaction intermediates to form GVL. GVL was further converted with the aid of both abundant hydrogenation and acidic sites, as Lewis acidic sites could further adsorb the oxygen-containing groups (C-O-C) in GVL. The conversion of GVL could happen via the hydrogenolysis to form 1,4-PDO, which was due to the synergy between hydrogenation sites and Brønsted acidic sites."
12,Catalytic reusability,"3.6 Catalytic reusability Fig. 9 shows the results of the reusability of various Co-based catalysts. The Co-based catalysts reduced at both 600 and 750 °C could still maintain the catalytic activity after four reusability tests, and a slight deactivation of the Co-Mg and Co-Mg-Al catalysts with a higher Mg content was observed, as is shown in Fig. 9(b). EL was easily converted to ethyl 4-hydroxyvalerate, due to the low Ea for the hydrogenation of EL (Fig. 6d). Therefore, GVL was selected as the reactant, as the conversion of GVL could be controlled to below 100%, and the results are shown in Fig. 10 . The Co-Mg-Al and Co-Al catalysts with the introduction of Al species exhibited the superior reusability for the conversion of GVL with negligible deactivation observed. An obvious decreasing GVL conversion was observed over Co-Mg catalyst with the absence of Al species. In addition, the reaction rate for the conversion of GVL was also calculated by comparing with the fresh and spent Co-based catalysts. Table 8 shows that the 2.1Co-0.9 Mg-Al catalyst exhibited a slight decreasing reaction rate for the conversion of GVL, indicating that 2.1Co-0.9 Mg-Al exhibited the superior activity and reusability for the production of 1,4-PDO. The presence of Mg species in catalysts resulted in the sintering of Co species (Table 1, Entry 1). On the contrary, the introduction of Al into catalysts could improve the catalytic stability of Co-based catalysts by suppressing the sintering of metallic Co, due to the strong interaction of Co species and Al-containing carrier, Herein, developing the robust and environmentally friendly Co-based catalysts by introducing the Al species for forming LDH as the precursor could efficiently suppress the deactivation of catalysts, and achieve the superior catalytic activity as well as stability for the conversion of biomass-derived EL."
13,Conclusions,"In summary, a series of Co-based catalysts derived from Al-containing LDH was prepared and used for the selective hydrogenation of EL to GVL or 1,4-PDO. Using LDH as the precursor induced strong interaction of Co species with the carrier, which could benefit the dispersion of Co species, create developed porous structures and facilitate formation of abundant acidic sites. The Co-Mg-Al and Co-Al catalysts exhibited the superior catalytic activity for the production of GVL or 1,4-PDO from EL. This was mainly due to the synergy between hydrogenation and acidic sites, which efficiently catalyzed the lactonization reaction and the conversion of GVL. The Ea for the conversion of GVL was 84.0 kJ/mol, which was the rate-determining step for the hydrogenation of EL to 1,4-PDO. In comparison, the Ea for the lactonization process for the formation of GVL was 78.0 kJ/mol, which was higher than that for the hydrogenation of EL (63.5 kJ/mol). The lactonization of ethyl 4-hydroxyvalerate was the rate-determining step from EL to GVL. The increasing Al species in Co-based catalysts favored the formation of acidic sites and the abundance of Co0 species, which facilitated both the formation and ring-opening of GVL. The Al-containing LDH structure also benefited the structural stability of the catalysts and suppressed the sintering of Co species, rendering the catalyst with good recyclability. This results herein provide some information about the reaction kinetics for the conversion of EL to GVL or 1,4-PDO and also are the proof for the synergy of hydrogenation and acidic sites, which benefits the development of the highly active catalysts for selective conversion of the biomass derivatives."
