0,Introduction,"In food processing industries, waste is produced from the separation of desired products from undesired by-products [1,2]. Such food industry wastes are product specific and therefore the composition of the waste does not vary significantly as the final product must have a consistent quality [3]. Numerous efforts have been made to utilize the biodegradable fraction of food processing waste (FPW) to produce useful products. Food waste valorization to useful products not only offers economic benefits, but also provides a solution to nuisances created by food waste degradation in the environment and landfills. FPW may be produced in solid, liquid or semi-solid form. Liquid wastes are generated as a result of use of large amounts of water for many applications, including temperature control, cleaning, process water, sanitation, transportation, cooking and as auxiliary water [4]. The effluent consists of suspended solids, organic matter and nitrogen in several forms, fats and oils and other inorganic materials [5]. Common liquid effluents include whey from cheese and yogurt production, whey from tofu production, bakery effluent from equipment washing, brewery effluent, oil mill effluent, soda industry effluent, potato processing wastewater, and apple pomace sludge. Some of the major solid wastes are tomato waste, apple pomace, inedible dough, waste bread, potato waste, soybean curd residue and grape pomace from wineries. Solid food wastes are rich in starch, lignin, cellulose and monosaccharides, mainly fructose and glucose, whereas the nutrients in liquid food wastes are available in diluted form. Generation of large amounts of food waste has an adverse impact on natural resources like water, land and biodiversity [6]. While both solid- and liquid-phase FPW would appear to have significant potential for conversion to alcohols or other renewable fuels, there are some barriers to widespread adoption of this practice. The feedstock for fuel production must be abundant and should not compete with food resources for humans or animals [7]. Also, high moisture content has been identified as a major obstacle to FPW management [2]. Another major barrier is obtaining FPW data in terms of volumes produced, often considered proprietary by the food manufacturers. Knowing waste volumes produced is important, as substrate availability is a major constraint in waste conversion processes. However, the amount of food processing waste generated is increasing every year as food production increases to support a growing population. Moreover, there is a trend of increased consumption of processed food items, especially as standards of living rise worldwide. Fig. 1 shows increasing trend of FPW volume and a linear forecast based on current increase in the waste generation rate from four representative sectors. The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) database 1 1 USDA-Economic Research Service, http://www.ers.usda.gov/. was used to obtain quantities of cheese produced, and tomatoes and potatoes processed from year 1970 to 2010. Several assumptions were then used to calculate the amount of waste produced from cheese production and processing of potatoes and tomatoes. Based on previous data, food waste volumes were linearly extrapolated to year 2040. The extrapolation shows that “business as usual” food waste generation will continue to increase significantly. Increasing food waste volume is a serious concern in terms of greenhouse gas emission, water footprint, land conversion and economics. Recent declines in fossil fuel prices, depleting natural resources and rising prices of raw materials stress the need to incentivize production of fuels from renewable energy sources. Production of biofuels, particularly fuel alcohols using lignocellulosic biomass, has gained increased interest over the last decade. While household and institutional food waste could be effectively treated using anaerobic digestion [3,8,9], alcohol production might be a good option to treat processing wastes. Because the costs involved in processing lignocellulosic raw material are high, it is necessary to evaluate cheaper raw materials to produce renewable alcohols. One such raw material is food waste that has low or zero cost of procurement. Food waste is a rich source of nutrients for microbes and can be converted to useful products like biofuels through biodegradation pathways. Carbohydrates and certain amino acids in food waste can be converted to a mixture of fuel alcohols -ethanol, butanol and propanol through fermentation. Such an approach would not only contribute to overcoming fuel supply constraints, but also help in reducing the wastes produced by food processing industries and the associated disposal costs. Commercializing biofuels using food waste substrates can be attractive because of these dual economic benefit. Although alcohol production is a potentially efficient option to convert food waste, careful evaluation of the technology and optimization of process economics is important before scale-up and commercialization. In this paper, various FPWs that could potentially provide raw materials for alcohol production have been evaluated. The major physical characteristics, organic and inorganic nutrient content of FPW were analyzed using statistical methods to approximate the composition of these wastes based on reported literature data. FPWs were divided into two categories: liquid effluents that are low in solids, and wastes that are rich in solid content. The liquid effluents analyzed included tofu processing wastewater, cheese and yogurt whey, potato processing wastewater and sweet beverage industry effluents. Waste materials that are rich in solids included apple pomace, tomato pomace, grape pomace, spent coffee grounds and bread waste. Beyond assessing the technical feasibility of food waste-to-alcohol conversion, the paper also considers the sustainability implications of production in terms of environmental and economic impacts. Bioenergy production from household and commercial food waste were reviewed before with the main focus being hydrogen and biomethane [10]. Other reviews evaluated various pathways of food waste conversion into new products, reducing the burden on virgin raw materials and assessment of challenges in large scale implementation of food waste recycling [11]. Several reviews focused on producing high value added products from food [12–16]. This review is believed to provide comprehensive information on major types of food processing wastes, physical and chemical characteristics, and their use in production of ethanol, 1-butanol, 3-methyl 1-butanol and organic acids. The composition of representative food wastes was estimated by averaging reported values from literature. Standard deviation was calculated for a given number of samples; however, as the data distribution was random, the standard deviation values were high for certain food waste due to outliers. Therefore, it was determined that reporting median values would be the most appropriate approximation of the composition of food wastes. Median values were calculated by ranking the numbers in ascending order and choosing the middle value. Median values, however, were calculated only for those properties that have a sample size of more than 3 reported values. Average, mean and median values were reported by analyzing the data from various literature for the micro and macro nutrients present in FPWs. Macro nutrients include carbohydrates, proteins and lipids. Micro nutrients include the minerals calcium (Ca2+), potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), magnesium (Mg2+), iron (Fe3+), manganese (Mn2+), zinc (Zn2+), phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S). In addition, certain physical and chemical properties like pH, total solids, ash content and COD were also reported from existing literature. This paper also summarizes literature data on ethanol, 1-butanol, 3-methyl 1-butanol and organic acid production from various FPWs. For consistency, all the values reported in Tables 1 through 5 were reduced to a common number significant figures."
1,Properties of food processing waste,"The wastewater from food processing industries can be considered nontoxic as it contains no or very few hazardous and non-biodegradable compounds [17]. As wastewater mainly contains organic materials, it can be treated conveniently using fermentation; however it may sometimes contain low concentrations of cleaning products that could be toxic. Tofu processing wastewater results from cooking soybeans and pressing tofu curds into blocks that are then prepared for sale. One kg of soybeans used in a typical tofu production operation generates 10l of wastewater and 0.25kg of solid waste known as tofu curd residue [18]. Tofu wastewater is rich in nitrogen, but low in carbon. It contains some complex polysaccharides in small amounts which make pretreatment necessary before conversion via fermentation. Whey is a food processing byproduct representing the strained liquid portion after coagulation of cheese or yogurt. Both cheese and yogurt whey are rich in lactose. Although lactose cannot be directly fermented by all microbes, certain microbes like Kluyveromyces can directly utilize lactose in whey to produce ethanol. Potato processing wastewater results from different operations. Silt water is a result of washing raw potatoes, while processing water results from peeling, cutting, cooking, grinding and packing [19]. Potato processing wastewater is rich in starch which theoretically makes a good substrate for alcohol production. Tomato waste is one of the most produced and least explored types of waste. The majority of tomato pomace produced is used in animal feed, and its application in fuel production is not well studied. An average 40% of the weight of processed tomatoes ends as waste, and is obtained after pressing of fresh tomatoes, and typically contains 33% seeds, 27% skin and 40% pulp [15]. In addition, dried tomato pomace contains fermentable simple sugars like fructose, glucose and sucrose [20]. Apple pomace is produced as a result of apple processing and includes peel, core, seed, calyx, stem and soft tissues [15]. Commercial technologies are becoming effective in reducing the amount of pomace produced, however 12–20% of the original weight of processed apples end up as pomace produced by the juice industry [21]. Grape pomace is the solid residue that remains after juice extraction or wine production from grapes [22]. Typically pomaces are composted, processed into animal feed or used in extraction of oil from seeds. Though many of these wastes have some degree of utilization, not all are utilized to their full potential. Therefore using these wastes in alcohol production could be a promising option."
2,Physical and chemical properties and organic content,"2.1 Physical and chemical properties and organic content The physical and chemical parameters reported here are, pH, COD, total solids, total carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and ash content. The pH of the waste is indicative of its freshness, as pH always changes upon storage or hydrolysis. Regardless of the pH of fresh waste, it is always required to control pH of the fermentation to meet process needs. COD is a measure of total amount of organic compounds present in the waste; by definition, it is the amount of oxygen required to oxidize all the organic matter present in waste. The higher the COD content, the higher is the nutritional value of the waste. Total solids indicate the amount of solids that remain after the waste is heated at 100°C until a constant weight is obtained. Ash content is an indication of total inorganic material present in the waste. Inorganics like metal ions play an important role in fermentation by acting as cofactors of enzymes of the alcohol production pathway. The organic composition plays an important role in waste treatment and production of valuable products. The higher the oxygen demand of a waste, generally the more difficult it is to treat, but it could act as a good substrate for production of alcohols. A high carbohydrate content is preferred to produce alcohols, especially ethanol; however very high concentration may have a detrimental effect in ethanol production [23,24]. Therefore it is necessary to dilute high sugar containing food wastes to achieve a free sugar concentration of 15–20% [18]. The presence of reducing sugars is necessary for alcohol fermentation, otherwise a pretreatment like acid hydrolysis, heat treatment or enzymatic hydrolysis will be necessary to convert complex sugars into reducing sugars. Pretreatment of raw material always involves additional energy and material costs. It is important to balance the amount of carbohydrates with the amount of proteins, as proteins are rich source of nitrogen. The substrate should always provide a balanced carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C/N). For example, co-fermentation of corn with a protein rich soy skim milk was found to enhance the fermentation rate of ethanol production by 18–25% [25]. Certain proteins tend to interact with starch, making the starch less susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis [26]. This could cause negative impact of starch utilization, leading to low ethanol production efficiency. Therefore, a careful combination of carbon and nitrogen sources is important to avoid antagonistic effects. The wastes from food processing are not generally rich in nitrogen, and addition of certain supplements may be necessary. Certain lipid molecules are known to produce varied stimulatory effect on yeast growth. The lipids rich in free fatty acids have been found to be controlling factors in ethanol tolerance of yeast, which was increased from 13% to 14% when lecithin, palmitic acid and cholesterol were added to the medium [27]. It was also found that low concentration of lipids stimulated ethanol production and high concentration reduced it when molasses was used as the substrate. Lipids affect fermentation in various ways, including as antifoam agents and improving the tolerance and growth stimulation. Before using food wastes for any production process, it is of utmost importance to characterize the amount and types of macronutrients available. Understanding the composition helps in careful design of an optimum process. The major physical and chemical properties and composition of organic nutrients are listed in Tables 1a, 1b. It is clear that the nutrients in liquid effluents are in diluted form. Carbohydrates are the major driving factor of alcohol production. The carbohydrates in liquid effluent range from a median value of 0.45%w/v to 4.3%w/v. This indicates that using liquid effluents in alcohol production almost always requires supplements like a reducing sugar or a nitrogen source to fulfill the nutrient requirements. Therefore the liquid effluents perhaps make a better dilution agent or replacement for process water during production rather than acting as production media themselves. Use of liquid effluents as process water reduces the water foot print of conventional processes to a great extent. The carbohydrate content of the wastes rich in solids range from a median value of 29.2%w/w to 54.6% w/w (Table 1.b) which is significantly higher than liquid effluents. Therefore, these wastes can form a better raw material for alcohol production. Although they are rich in carbohydrates, a few like apple pomace are low in nitrogen, and in such cases, nitrogen supplementation may be necessary to meet the medium requirements. A combination of solid-rich waste and liquid effluents can also form an ideal production medium; however economic aspects like transportation costs must be analyzed before using the combined raw materials."
3,Inorganic content (minerals),"2.2 Inorganic content (minerals) Inorganic content of food waste is contributed by various metal ions. Metal ions play an important role in metabolism of all organisms, as they take part in a variety of biocatalytic reactions, and act as co-factors for enzymes responsible for growth and product formation. They also maintain osmotic pressure of the cells in the production medium. Both metal limitation and overload can cause cell death [27] and hence limit alcohol production. Therefore, mineral composition of a substrate can significantly affect the yield of alcohol. For example, addition of supplemental ferrous sulfate to cheese whey increased butanol concentration from 0.06 to 7.13g/L, and supplementing ferric chloride yielded 4.32g/L butanol under the same experimental conditions [28]. It was hypothesized that metal ions selectively alter fermentative metabolism in Clostridium, leading to higher or lower concentration of alcohols, and improve the capacity of Clostridium to produce ferredoxin, a key protein in the metabolism. Under such circumstances, addition of minerals is essential as a single type of food waste may not have all the micronutrients necessary to achieve high yields. Addition of minerals to whey was also found to alter the ratio of butanol to acetone [29], and an increase in this ratio is an important factor in reducing the energy requirement during downstream processing of butanol. The presence of Mg2+, Mn2+, Fe2+ and K+ were shown important for stabilizing the yeast strain and improving ethanol production using mango residues [30]. Statistical design of experiment (DOE) method was applied to optimize the concentration of metal ions to produce ethanol from molasses [31], sea weed [32], bagasse [33] and other lignocellulosic biomass. There is a general need for better understanding of the effects of minerals while producing alcohols from FPW. It might be necessary to supplement these minerals in the form of micronutrient solution to achieve higher alcohol yield. Metal absorption is hypothesized as a controlling mechanism in alcohol tolerance levels in microbes [34]. This theory can be used to genetically modify microbes to better absorb minerals and thus acquire improved alcohol tolerance and higher productivity. Tables 2.a, 2.b show mineral composition of various FPWs. The reported values indicate that the wastes rich in solids have high concentration of minerals, increasing the possibility of using these wastes as complete production medium. However, some of them may need to be supplemented in order to fulfill the metal ion requirement of microbes. For example, magnesium and zinc are key metal ions in ethanol fermentation, because they act as modulators of important enzymes in the glycolytic pathway and regulate yeast stress, dynamics and stability of cell membranes [35]. All of the food wastes listed except grape pomace are zinc deficient, indicating a need for zinc supplementation. Grape pomace could possibly be used as a zinc supplement to other waste materials reducing the need for addition of expensive zinc salts."
4,Alcohol products from FPW conversion,"Renewable fuels and biofuels have gained increasing importance because of raising environmental concerns associated with combustion of fossil fuel resources [36]. Alcohols are now used as oxygenating blending components for gasoline. Ethanol is the most commonly used alcohol, however, advanced biofuels like propanol, 1-butanol, and 3-methyl 1-butanol are receiving attention from alcohol producers. Ethanol is produced commercially using corn as the primary feedstock, while other feedstocks have not been widely used for large-scale ethanol production except sugarcane molasses. There are significant research and development efforts underway for the large-scale production of butanol from lignocellulosic materials, though butanol has not yet been regulated as a fuel blend in the USA. There are limited efforts on using propanol as a fuel, possibly due to its relatively high viscosity. Methanol is used at a lesser extent as fuel, produced by chemical synthesis. Though alcohol production from FPW was explored several years ago [37–40], a continued research effort is required to reduce the production cost of higher alcohols to achieve commercial viability. FPWs are cheaper raw materials compared to all other substrates currently being used, e.g., corn, lignocellulosic biomass and molasses. However, food waste composition varies significantly with geographical location and season, and therefore optimizing the production process plays an important role in overcoming spatial and temporal variations in food waste composition and still achieving acceptably high yield."
5,Ethanol,"3.1 Ethanol Ethanol production from food wastes with solid content as high as 35% w/w has been studied using mashed potatoes, sweet corn and white bread collected from cafeterias, households and retail stores [41,42]. Ebner et al. have reported an ethanol yield of 295L/ dry ton of retail food waste processed. They also indicated that this process resulted in negative greenhouse gas emission impact and approximately 500% improvement relative to corn ethanol process [43]. Though higher ethanol yield can be achieved using these wastes, pretreatment is an essential step that accounts for a high fraction of total production cost. If pretreatment methods are optimized to reduce the cost, these wastes can be potential substrates for production. Whey is typically used for production in the form of whey permeate or concentrated whey [44]. Using whey as substrate, it is possible to reach the maximum theoretical yield of ethanol, though final production volume may be lower. Various researchers were able to achieve ethanol concentration of 8.8g/L to 22g/L using crude and pretreated whey. This indicates that whey could act as potential substrate for a small-scale ethanol production unit distributing the product locally. Apple pomace was explored as a substrate for alcohol production several years ago [45], but further efforts on research and development have been limited. Some recent studies have shown that apple pomace can be fermented in solid state with or without pretreatment and supplements to obtain higher yield of ethanol [46,47]. Therefore, apple pomace appears to be a promising substrate; however, seasonal availability of apple pomace could pose potential challenge in its availability as a substrate. The possibility of using tomato pomace has also been investigated [48], however, the yield achieved by conversion of untreated tomato pomace is not economically viable. The observed ethanol concentrations from various FPWs are shown in Table 3. The maximum reported ethanol concentration from apple pomace is 190g/kg using enzyme pretreatment and a vacuum extraction recovery method [49]. Tomato pomace has not been directly used to produce ethanol, though a serum obtained from supercritical extraction of tomato pomace yielded an ethanol concentration of 46.8g/L [48]. Ethanol producing yeasts are not capable of utilizing all types of carbohydrates present in the food waste. For example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacks enzymes to utilize lactose. Certain yeast species like Klyuveromyces are capable of hydrolyzing lactose and are suitable for whey fermentation. In some circumstances, co-fermentation will be necessary to efficiently convert different carbohydrates present into ethanol. In one study, Saccharomyces coreanus and Pichia stipites were used in co-fermenting hexose and pentose present in food waste. The carbohydrates that were not utilized by one organism were utilized by the other at a later stage in the fermentation process. This improved overall conversion efficiency and the ethanol concentration increased from 40.6g/L to 48.6g/L [50]. Co-fermentation was examined using starch degrading fungus and ethanol producing yeast [51]. This approach reduced the need for pretreatment of the waste and hence was more energy efficient. Co-fermentation of solid bakery wastes with cheese whey in the presence of enzymes was shown to improve the ethanol yield by 30–33% [52]."
6,Butanol,"3.2 Butanol Butanol, a four-carbon alcohol is an important bulk material for the synthesis of a variety of chemical products and an efficient biofuel with properties clearly superior to those of ethanol [53]. These properties include higher mileage, non-corrosiveness, ability to be used without engine modifications, non-hygroscopic nature and ability to use in existing pipelines. [36,54–56]. Butanol, like ethanol, helps to reduce carbon monoxide levels in the engine exhaust since it is a good oxygenate [57]. Its non-hygroscopic nature generally makes fuels with butanol have a longer shelf life. Butanol is less corrosive than ethanol, which means that there may be more potential for distributing butanol via pipeline instead of batch movement by truck or rail as is done for ethanol. Currently, butanol is synthesized chemically for industrial uses and much of the research is based on fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass. Several researchers however, have reported the use of apple pomace [58] and bakery waste in 1-butanol production [41]. Whey is one of the most widely studied food-processing liquid wastes to produce butanol. Table 4 shows reported 1-butanol concentrations from various FPWs. To our knowledge, there is no published literature for the use of tomato pomace and tofu wastewater in butanol production. A butanol concentration of 22g/L has been reported using apple pomace when apple pomace was supplemented with nitrogen source and minerals [40]. In addition to 1-butanol, a few researchers have investigated production of 3-methyl 1-butanol, also known as isobutanol.3-methyl 1-butanol, commonly known as isobutanol, has several properties superior to those of 1-butanol: higher heating value and carbon content, and more stable as it has more side chains than 1-butanol. Only a few microorganisms, particularly ethanol producing yeasts, possess capability to produce isobutanol [59]. Hence, there are only a few research efforts to produce isobutanol from yeast using food waste ( Table 5). A 3-methyl 1-butanol concentration of 80mg/L for whey permeate using K. fragilis has been reported in literature [60]. To our knowledge, there are no other reports on use of crude whey in the production of isobutanol. Though food wastes show some potential to produce isobutanol, the observed yields are too low to be economical; however, this could be an important research opportunity to genetically modify yeasts to produce high amounts of isobutanol. One such effort looked into producing isobutanol using genetically modified E coli to ferment protein waste from food processing. These researchers were able to obtain an isobutanol concentration of 4g/L through this effort [61]. This research is promising in exploring the use of protein-rich food waste materials like meat processing waste in alcohol production which are otherwise unsuitable for anaerobic digestion or composting."
7,Other alcohols and precursors,"3.3 Other alcohols and precursors Although ethanol and 1-butanol are widely proposed for fuel applications, other higher alcohols like propanol have large number of applications as a bulk material in synthesis, cosmetic ingredient, sanitizing agent and flavoring compound. Few authors have suggested fermentative production of propanol, however it is mostly produced using synthetic media. The production of other alcohols and organic acids is summarized in Table 6. A recent study on microbial production of propanol reviewed the published literature for fermentative production of propanol [62] and reported a maximum propanol concentration of 25.1g/L obtained till date using a genetically modified Clostridium sp. There are no reported studies on use of FPW in propanol production. Some authors have indicated that Rhizopus oryzae can produce variety of flavoring compounds, including propanol [63,64]. Organic acids like acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid are precursors of alcohols as well as important industrial commodity chemicals. These compounds can also be produced from conversion of food wastes [65]. Whey lactose has been reported to be a good raw material for the production of propionic acid, which not only acts as a precursor in the production of alcohol but also used as an antifungal agent in food, as an intermediate in bioplastic synthesis and as a solvent in pharmaceuticals [66]. Apple pomace can be a useful raw material in the production of acetic acid [49], lactic acid [67] and citric acid [68]. When the food wastes are used exclusively for the production of organic acid a very high yield can be achieved, for example acetic acid concentration of 614g/kg was achieved using apple pomace as substrate and Acetobacter acetii bacterium [49]. Acetic acid can be converted into ethanol using simple catalytic processes."
8,Sustainability considerations and challenges in alcohol production from FPW,"Food processing operations generally have a large water footprint. For example, the water requirement in beer processing ranges from 9000 to 15,000L/metric ton, 9000–18000L/metric ton for dairy products, and up to 32,000L/metric ton in fruit processing [17]. Both solid waste and wastewater are the primary areas of pollution control in food processing. Using these waste streams to produce alcohols and other value-added products would increase the environmental benefits of food processing operations. The majority of food wastes generated in the USA and many other countries are currently landfilled, but diverting food wastes from landfills would save limited space and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, especially methane resulting from degradation of organic materials [69]. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization, the footprint of food produced and not consumed is approximately 3.3 gigaton of CO2 and 250 cubic kilometer of water equivalent [70]. Considering these sustainability aspects, it would seem essential to reduce the carbon and water footprint of food processing industries by using the waste as raw materials for alcohol production or other beneficial use. This would not only reduce the environmental footprint of the food manufacturer, but also the environmental impact relative to conventional alcohol production processes. As the raw material used is a waste stream, there will not be any negative impact that could have come from land use, growth, harvest and harsh pretreatment methods of the conventional process. Using wastewater as diluent could also reduce the water footprint of alcohol industries. Therefore, use of food processing solid and liquid wastes as raw materials in alcohol production will have better environmental benefits compared with conventional methods. To date, no known studies have assessed the life cycle impact of alcohol production from food processing wastes. An economic analysis conducted on production of butanol using wheat straw estimated that nearly 27% of the annual operating cost of production originates from raw materials [71]. The corn ethanol raw material cost accounts for 45–58% of the total production cost without assigning any co-product credits [72,73]. Lignocellulosic raw materials account for approximately 32% of the total ethanol production cost. All conventional processes involve high raw material cost. Although food waste cannot replace all the raw materials due to limited availability, it can reduce the annual operating cost by contributing at some capacity. Also, alcohol plants could generate additional revenue by charging a tipping fee to the food waste haulers. Alternatively, food processing facilities could build their own small or medium scale alcohol plants to generate revenue from their waste. Crude ethanol concentration in fermentation broth, produced from corn ranges between 8% and 12% based on the initial solids loading [74–76]. From Fig. 2(a), it is clear that waste bread, apple pomace, retail store wastes and restaurant waste are capable of meeting or surpassing the average 10% ethanol concentration in commercial operations. Other food wastes like grape pomace, tomato pomace and potato waste show potential to produce ethanol, however the yields obtained are too low to scale up. High solids content wastes like apple pomace and mixed restaurant or retail waste streams generally have more potential as feedstocks than liquid effluents. The concentration of butanol from various food wastes are presented in Fig. 3. The food wastes that yield more than 1.5% crude butanol in fermentation broth were considered as potential substrates, because the maximum achievable butanol concentration reported in various literature ranges between 1.5% and 1.8% with a total solvent concentration of 2% in batch fermentation using Clostridium strains. Higher yield can be obtained by continuously recovering the product by methods like gas stripping, extractive fermentation or membrane separation. In such cases, mixed food waste with or without pretreatment makes the best raw material for producing butanol. The practical difficulties in obtaining higher butanol yield are currently attributed to lower tolerance level of the clostridial strains. Other food wastes like apple pomace, sweet and acid whey and bakery wastes have shown equal potential to produce butanol provided a suitable in situ product recovery method is used. This review would point to these materials as worthy of further study on the commercial viability of food waste-to-butanol conversion. As production of alcoholic fuels appears non-feasible for many food wastes, these food wastes could potentially be used in the production of solvent alcohols. The U.S. produces annually more than 1200M liter of butanol and over 750M liter of ethanol for chemical and solvent uses. The production is mainly a chemical process using propylene as raw material for butanol production, and ethylene as raw material for ethanol; both propylene and ethylene are derived from fossil fuels. The demand for isobutanol is nearly 100M liter per year [77]. These statistics indicate that there is not only huge demand for alcohols as fuels, but also as solvents. Production of solvent alcohols from food wastes could be more practical compared to fuel production, as the demand is significantly lower than for fuels and market prices are higher. Food processors could have a small-scale solvent production facility to derive additional economic value out of the waste they generate. Ethanol is used extensively as a solvent in the manufacture of perfumes and varnishes, as preservative of biological specimens, pharmaceutical solvent, formulation of essence and flavoring agents, disinfecting and tincture solutions [78]. Butanol is used as an extracting solvent in recovery of antibiotics, hormones and vitamins, as a paint solvent, ink ingredient, intermediate in the production of butyl acrylates and butyl ethers, automotive polish, perfume ingredient, degreasing and cleaning agent [79]. Also, propanol is used in manufacture of resins, adhesives, floor polish and metal degreasing fluid, sanitizers, insecticides, herbicides, pharmaceuticals and packaging polymers [80]. The energy requirements and cost of production are very high when chemical synthesis methods are used. Therefore, a cheap raw material like food waste opens up potential opportunities to reduce the energy demand and overall cost of production. As food waste is high in organic content, storage and transportation pose significant operational challenges. It is always difficult to haul liquid food wastes unless there are pipelines from food processor to the bio-refinery. Solid food wastes must be dried before they are stored and transported to avoid faster decay of organic materials, but drying incurs additional cost of handling. The feasibility of operating an alcohol plant using food waste is not completely understood. There is a need to assess the relative merits of centralized or independent small- and medium-scale alcohol plants capable of treating food wastes, as well as establishing policies for incentivizing this technology. The production capacity of corn ethanol outnumbers all other technologies including lignocelluloses, municipal wastes, and food processing wastes. The potential barriers of each new raw material in the production of alcohols would need careful consideration and systematic planning. Fig. 4 outlines the practical barriers for commercialization of alcohols produced from FPW. Although alcohol production is a potential option for food waste valorization, there are several research gaps and constraints that must be addressed to further develop the technology. The yield of alcohols from food waste are higher only when an in situ product recovery method is used. There is still a need to develop energy efficient and economic product recovery techniques to improve alcohol production from food wastes. There is also a need to optimize cheaper and more efficient pretreatment methods for recovering the highest amount of fermentable carbohydrates from food wastes. It would be useful to develop a co-fermentation process to use food wastes with corn and lignocellulosic raw materials. Catalytic conversion of ethanol to a higher alcohol like butanol could offer great advantages in terms of energy value, transport and storage, as well as minimizing requirements for modification of conventional gasoline engines. A major constraint in butanol production is poor tolerance of microbes to higher butanol concentrations. A genetic engineering approach to design microbes with improved tolerance would address this problem. While there is an increasing demand for drop-in biofuels, newer technologies and cheaper raw materials are essential to bridge this gap. Also, it is difficult to meet a significant fraction of fuel demand with current alcohol production potential of food waste. In this regard, use of food wastes in production of alcohols for industrial applications may be a more favorable option to consider."
9,Conclusions,"This paper reviewed physical and chemical characteristics of FPW and discussed current status and constraints in producing alcohols from FPW. The waste composition varies widely across sectors, which makes standardizing a production process difficult. FPW can be utilized in ethanol production to a significant extent, but producing other higher alcohols needs extensive research. Though there are a number of published articles in this area, only a few studies have shown promising results in terms of alcohol yields. The forecasted waste quantities showed that FPW generation will continue to increase in the future and must be effectively utilized. A proper understanding of waste composition and generation quantities would help in standardizing a production process. An industrial ecology approach could be used to map the food waste resources available in a particular region, and thereby provide an estimate of the share of food wastes available for the production of various alcohols. Before using food wastes for large-scale production of alcohols, it is important to evaluate life cycle energy requirement and environmental impact of the production process. A thorough economic evaluation of the technology, particularly for upstream processing, is important as using food waste could significantly reduce the cost of raw material and production."
