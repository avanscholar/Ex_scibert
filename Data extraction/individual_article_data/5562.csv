0,Introduction,"In recent era electricity is the fastest developing form of energy. Regardless of the fact that it is being utilized more efficiently, and extensive research and developments have been carried out toward fuel switching other than oil, there are many challenges which electricity industry still facing among them, the most important one is the environmental impact of electricity production and its application (Divya, Rana, Alwarappan, Saraswathi, & Nagendran, 2019; Pandey, 2019). The harmful emissions related with traditional energy production systems can be decreased by diversifying energy resources. Relating to this, the advancement of new, affordable, and sustainable power sources have gained great attention (Vijayakumar & Khastgir, 2018). As fuel cells are clean energy producing devices, they play a major role in reducing high demands of petroleum derivatives and their unfriendly environmental impacts in energy generation systems (Devi, Divya, Kaleekkal, Rana, & Nagendran, 2018; He et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2017). Fuel cell is basically an environmental friendly energy production system, converts chemical energy of fuel into electrical energy through redox reactions without elimination of harmful byproducts (Hasani-Sadrabadi, Dashtimoghadam, Mokarram, Majedi, & Jacob, 2012; Lee, Gil, Kim, Han, & Lee, 2016). Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) are a further upgrade of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) which have been broadly examined for clean energy production (Divya, Saraswathi, Alwarappan, Nagendran, & Rana, 2018). It has found applications in a variety of fields such as transportation, aerospace, and mobile power generation systems. There are some beneficial points related to the use of DMFC such as high energy density, simple design, easy storage, and transportation of fuels (Peng, Lai, & Liu, 2016; Prapainainar, Du, Kongkachuichay, Holmes, & Prapainainar, 2017). The polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) is the main component of DMFCs, and it performs two major jobs: it acts as proton transfer medium and plays the role of partition between the gases/fuels and oxidant among anode and cathode (Cheng et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015). At present, the membrane electrolyte components of DMFCs are prepared using standard Nafion® and Felmion® based polymers manufactures by DuPont. Such polymeric membranes possess some admirable features including excellent chemical stability and outstanding ionic conductivity, i.e 0.1S/cm (Rajendran & Prabhu, 2017; Ryu et al., 2017), which make them the best candidates for DMFC. Conversely, Nafion® based electrolyte membrane pose serious drawback of fuel permeability from one electrode (anode) to other (cathode). Moreover, such Nafion®-based membrane electrolytes lower their ionic conductivity at elevated temperatures. These disadvantages result in lowering of cell performance, and adversely affecting fuel efficiency. Other shortcomings are their high swelling and high cost (Jin, Zhu, Zhang, & Li, 2018). Research is being carried out to synthesize new alternative polymer composite membranes with low cost, low swelling rate, and high proton conductivity (Kim et al., 2017) Alternative PEMs such as sulfonated polyether ether ketone (SPEEK)/polyetherimide (PEI), (Muliawati et al., 2017) sulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone)/fluorenyl, (Hu et al., 2016) polybenzimidazole/SiO2, (Devrim, Devrim, & Eroglu, 2016) and polyethylene glycol (PEG)/SiO2 have been synthesized through sol-gel processes and examined for DMFC (Chang & Lin, 2003). Chitosan (CS) is a naturally occurring biopolymer. It offers some characteristic properties including the ease of fabrication, environmentally-friendly behaviors, and high hydrophilicity. These properties enable CS to be used in various kinds of membrane fabrication and employed in many applications including reverse osmosis, ultrafiltration pervaporation, and lithium batteries (Malmiri, Jahanian, & Berenjian, 2012). Currently, the excellent properties of CS are also being applied to synthesize PEMs for different kinds of fuel cells including alkaline fuel cells, biofuel cells, and DMFCs (Ma & Sahai, 2013). In DMFCs, chitosan helps to achieve the requirements of low cost and exceptional alcohol rejection (Kraytsberg & Ein-Eli, 2014). The other necessary properties, including mechanical, thermal, and chemical stability, good ionic conductivity, and low swelling, are obtained either by sulfonation, phosphorylation, quaternization, crosslinking or making blends with other kinds of polymeric materials (Marroquin, Rhee, & Park, 2013; Wu, Liu, Chen, Yang, & Chen, 2010). Plasticization and crosslinking increase the amorphous domain and lower the crystalline phase of chitosan-based membrane, increasing ionic conduction (Chávez, Oviedo-Roa, Contreras-Pérez, Martínez-Magadán, & Castillo-Alvarado, 2010; Tripathi & Shahi, 2011). Due to hydrophilicity, CS has a high degree of water uptake which leads to high swelling and causes the membrane to be fragile which reduces its durability in fuel cells (Ikram, Ahmed, Ali, & Agarwal, 2017). Smitha et al. prepared a CS and pyrrolidone (PVP) blend to overcome the downsides of the low mechanical stability of CS based MMMs (Smitha, Sridhar, & Khan, 2006). Vijayakumar and Khastgir fabricated CS and sulfonated polyaniline based electrolytes which exhibited good mechanical stability and improved oxidative stability along with enhanced proton conductivity (Vijayakumar & Khastgir, 2018). PVA is most widely used as a matrix for the fabrication of composite membranes due to its inherent filmmaking capacity and high affinity for water (Zhiwei et al., 2019). Pure PVA membranes present a very high swelling rate in cold water and a high solubility in water. Therefore, various modification and insolubilisation reactions such as grafting or crosslinking are carried out to make PVA-based films with enhanced mechanical strength and lower water permeation (Sidharthan & Joseph, 2019). PVA (Polyvinyl alcohol) has good methanol blocking ability and possesses good chemical and mechanical strength which makes it an acceptable candidate for the preparation of blended PEMs (Erkartal, Usta, Citir, & Sen, 2016). However pure PVA has no fixed charges, therefore a variety of functional groups (OH, NH2,COOH, RSO3 −, NR+ 4) are introduced into the PVA matrix for the generation of ionic species. All multifunctional compounds with the ability to react with hydroxyl groups can be applied to prepare three-dimensional structures. Many cross-linked PVA-based composite membranes have been prepared and reported (de Oliveira, Nascimento, & De Oliveira, 2016; Zhou, He, & Xie, 2016). The polymer’s solubility can be further reduced by the addition of inorganic fillers, including zirconia, clays, and silica (Laberty-Robert, Valle, Pereira, & Sanchez, 2011). The induction of inorganic fillers allows not only incorporate the favorable characteristics from both inorganic and organic materials but also produce completely new configurations with truly distinctive features (de Oliveira et al., 2016; Üçtuğ & Nijem, 2017). Among other inorganic particles, zeolites have gained substantial research interest due to their distinctive molecular sieving effect and effectively open crystal system with a pore size of several angstroms, along with their malleable framework. Generally, zeolites are three-dimensional microporous crystalline bifunctional materials with pore opening channels in the range of <20 Å, basically consist of [SiO4] and [AlO4] tetrahedral units that contain cations in the frame work (Prokešová-Fojtíková, Mintova, Čejka, Žilková, & Zukal, 2006). In addition, in a composite system these materials can retain water within the polymer matrix due to hydrophilic ionic clusters, and help in proton transport by a vehicular mechanism (Zhang et al., 2011). They also improve the acidity of the polymer composite because of the presence of aluminum in their structure and also offer large surface area and appealing cation exchange capacity that can lower the methanol permeation in DMFCs. The introduction of zeolites within polymer structure usually improves the dimensional stability of prepared composite PEMs at elevated temperature (Erkartal et al., 2016; Sasikala, Gopi, & Bhat, 2016; Vaghari, Jafarizadeh-Malmiri, Berenjian, & Anarjan, 2013). The main limiting factor of zeolites is their low proton conductivity when compared to perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA). In zeolite-based composite membranes, zeolite creates a hindrance to methanol transportation, but at the same time they also hamper proton transport, but recent research shows that it is possible to obtain high conductivity with zeolites by modifying them with sulfonic acid groups or silane coupling agents (Prapainainar, Kanjanapaisit, Kongkachuichay, Holmes, & Prapainainar, 2016). The functionalization or surface modification of the zeolite is important before incorporating it into the polymer blend/matrix. The unmodified zeolite is more hydrophilic like those found in nature and may exhibit more swelling and fuel cross over, which may lower proton condctivity of resultants MMMs (Sasikala et al., 2016). It is likely that the grafting of aromatic rings and less acidic COOH groups on chitosan balances out its hydrophilic-hydrophobic nature and improves proton conducting properties. Furthermore, by blending with other polymers and attaching strong acidic groups (SO3H) a functionalized inorganic material can show high proton conductivity and stability (Kalaiselvimary, Sundararajan, & Prabhu, 2018; Shirdast, Sharif, & Abdollahi, 2016). Keeping in mind the above factors in this study, the synergetic effect of mixed matrix membranes comprising of N-p-carboxy benzyl chitosan (CBC) /PVA with unmodified (UZ) and modified/sulfonated zeolite (MZ) was studied for DMFC. Here, we used microporous zeolite-13X due to its uniform pore size, high water sorption, large surface area, high proton transfer capacity, and acid resistance (Zhang et al., 2011). However, the functionalization of Zeolite-13X becomes necessary before it is trapped in polymers which also make it more compatible and homogeneous with polymer matrix. The surface modification (sulfonation) of zeolite was done by silane condensation reaction. The prepared MMMs were characterized using different techniques including attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The conductivities of prepared MMMs consisting of UZ and MZ contents were investigated via impedance spectroscopy and the methanol permeability was investigated using gas chromatography."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Chitosan 90 % (Mw=∼2 × 105 was obtained from ACROS ORGANICS. Analytical grade PVA Mw =89000 Da, Zeolite- 13X < 60 μm, 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane MPTMS were acquired from Sigma Aldrich. Acetic acid was purchased from Merck Co. Germany. Nafion® 117 membranes from DuPont Co. USA. Platinum Pt was gotten from Johnson–Matthey UK. Nafion solution from Sigma-Aldrich Corp. USA."
3,Fabrication of C-CPMZ composite membranes,"2.2 Fabrication of C-CPMZ composite membranes A schematic illustration of the synthesis strategy for C-CPMZ composite membranes is presented in Fig. 1 . It consists of the following steps. 2.2.1 Synthesis of surface modified zeolite The surface modification (sulfonation) of zeolite was done by silane condensation reaction. For this purpose, 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS) was used as sulfoanting agent (Sun, Lu, Chen, & Jiang, 2008). In a typical procedure, 5 g of zeolite, MPTMS (1 ml), and toluene (60 ml) were allowed to mix well under mechanical stirring and refluxed at 100 °C for 5 h. As for the thiol precursor (MPTMS), the mercapto groups grafted onto zeolite was oxidized into sulfonic acid groups with 30 wt. % H2O2 solution at 25 °C for 20 h. The resultant sulfonated zeolite was filtered, washed 3–5 times with ethanol and water to remove unreacted silane residue, and allowed to dry overnight at 110 °C for further use. 2.2.2 Synthesis of N-p-carboxy benzyl chitosan In a typical synthetic procedure, chitosan (CS) was dissolved in an acetic acid solution at pH 3. After complete dissolution, an appropriate amount of 4-carboxy benzaldehyde was added. The mixture was stirred continuously for 5 h at room temperature. After the development of imine (Schiff’s base) by the condensation of aldehyde and amine functionality, the pH was slowly raised up to 4.5 by using an alkali solution. The obtained mixture was stirred for 1 h and finally precipitated in alcohol. The precipitate was washed by ethyl alcohol and deionized water. The obtained product was saved for further use. 2.2.3 Crosslinking of CBC/PVA with MA For crosslinking purpose MA is used (Han, Li, Chen, Xu, & Wickramasinghe, 2003; Meng, Chen, Yu, Li, & Jiang, 2000). Initially the CBC solution was prepared by adding 4 g of CBC into 40 ml of acetic acid (AA) and heating for 2 h at 55 °C. In another beaker, a 10 % PVA solution was prepared. Both solutions were mixed together and crosslinker MA (0.6 g) was added dropwise to ensure the uniformity. The resultant mixture was heated at 50 °C for 1 h until a homogeneous solution was obtained. 2.2.4 Incorporation of zeolite into the crosslinked CBC/PVA blend Three different weight percentages of UZ (10, 30, and 50 wt. %) were added into the cross-linked CBC/PVA blends as shown in Table 1 . The reaction mixture was then stirred at 55 °C for 2–3 h and sonicated for 15 min to obtain complete dispersion. The solutions were kept overnight to removes bubbles. Using a dissolution casting technique (Libby, Smyrl, & Cussler, 2003), the bubble free solutions were then cast on identical Petri dishes to ensure uniform thickness. The Petri dishes were evaporated at room temperature for 2 days. After complete evaporation, the membranes were peeled off using of sharp blades. The same procedure was followed for modified zeolite (MZ) composite membranes. The prepared composite membranes were labeled as C-CPUZ10, C-CPUZ30, C-CPUZ50, C-CPMZ10, C-CPMZ30, and C-CPMZ50. The possible reaction mechanism between CBC/PVA and MZ is given in Scheme 1 ."
4,Characterizations,
5,Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),3.1 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) FTIR analysis of the prepared composite membrane was carried out with an IR Prestige-21 (Shimadzu) with the help of attenuated total reflectance (ATR) accessory armed with a zinc selenide (ZnSe) crystal. Before each sample scan an air background of the instrument was run. The range of frequency was from 4000 to 400 cm−1 at a 4.0 cm−1 resolution of and average of 64 scans per spectrum was recorded.
6,X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements,"3.2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements The crystallography of synthesized composite membranes was studied by X-ray diffraction. The XRD pattern was attained at ambient temperature by X-ray Powder Diffractometer (D/Max-3A Regaku) utilizing Cu Ka radiation (λ =1.5418 Å), 30 mA current, and 35 kV voltage. The scanning range was from 0° to 100°."
7,Scanning electron microscopy (SEM),"3.3 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) The surface features of all samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Philips XL30ESEM). The SEM was run in low vacuum mode to examine the membranes. Before analyzing the samples were sputtered with gold for about 120 s in order to make certain that no charge at surface is present. Gold sputtering was conducted via Denton Vacuum Sputtering Auto-matico Desk IV."
8,Ion exchange capability (IEC),"3.4 Ion exchange capability (IEC) The IEC of prepared membranes were found by applying a titration method. Each membrane was weighted before immersion in NaCl solution of (2 mol L−1) for a period of 24 h to ensure the replacement of H+ by Na+ ions. The titration of residual solution was done using a 0.01 mol L−1 NaOH solution. Phenolphthalein was used as an indicator. The IEC (mmol g−1) of sample membranes was measured by using Eq. (1), where VNaOH (ml) shows NaOH solution volume used in the titration while Wd (g) represents dry membrane’s weight. (1) I E C = 0.01 ( m E q ) × 1000 ( m E q ) × V N a O H ( m l ) W d"
9,Methanol permeability,"3.5 Methanol permeability The methanol permeation capacities of sample membranes were investigated using a glass diffusion cell containing two compartments having similar volumes detached by the membrane sheet. The membranes samples were dipped in DI water for 24 h before fixing them in the diffusion cell. In a typical procedure, two sections were filled with a H2O and MeOH solution (12 mol L−1) respectively. The methanol concentration was investigated by using a gas chromatography (Agilent 6820) having a DB624 column and a TCD detector. The methanol permeation was determined by Eq. (2), where S shows the slope of methanol concentration curve VB (mL) is the water volume in water compartment; CA (mol L−1) is the stating methanol concentration in methanol compartment. A (cm2) and L (cm) are the thickness and area of the membrane, respectively (2) p = S V B L A C A D"
10,Water uptake,"3.6 Water uptake In order to measure the water uptake (WU), the prepared membranes were dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 4 h. The weight of the dried membrane was noted. In next step, the membranes were soaked in DI water for 24 h at room temperature. After the completion of 24 h the residual water from wetted membrane was wiped with the help tissue paper and weight was again measured instantly. The WU was find out using Eq. 3: (3) W U = W w e t - W d r y W d r y × 100 % Where Wwet and Wdry were the masses of dried and wet membrane samples respectively."
11,Proton conductivity,"3.7 Proton conductivity The proton conduction of mixed matrix membrane was measured with four-probe AC impedance spectroscopy technique. Before the investigation of proton conductivity, the sample was allowed to equilibrate in 0.2 mol L−1 H2SO4 for 24 h. The conductivity measurements for the zeolite filled mixed matrix membranes were carried out within fully-humidified condition with a frequency range of 1–106 Hz and oscillating voltage of 10 mV. The measurements were recorded at different temperatures range i.e. 25 °C–100 °C. All the membranes have the thickness of 35–45um and size membrane sample was 5 × 5 cm² and all measurements were repeated by three times The proton conductivity (Scm−1) of each membrane was calculated by Eq. (4) (4) o = L A R Where L is the thickness, A is area of membrane, and R is membrane resistance."
12,Fuel cell performance,"3.8 Fuel cell performance Membrane electrode assemblies with a three-layer structure were prepared. Toray Carbon Paper with thickness of 0.27 mm was coated with gas diffusion layer, in next step catalyst layer was coated onto the GDL. The carbon paper was brushed with using 10 wt. % PTFE solution to make it wet proof. The anode catalyst was comprised of (20 wt. % Pt +10. wt % Ru on carbon) in 5 wt. % Nafion. While the cathode was prepared by coating the same catalyst ink without Ru with same loading. Both prepared electrodes were cold pressed membrane followed by curing at 50 °C for 15 h followed by hot pressing at 110 °C for 5 min at 1.2 MPa. The MEA was fixed in a single cell. The measurements were performed in the oxygen mode of operation at a 10 psi pressure with varied concentration of methanol feed at the anode side with a pressure of 7 psi at 80 °C for all prepared PEMs."
13,Results and discussion,
14,"Analysis of functional group, crystal structure, and morphology","4.1 Analysis of functional group, crystal structure, and morphology The FTIR analysis of UZ, MZ, and CBC/PVA-MZ membranes is presented in Fig. 2 . The characteristic zeolite bands at 900, 659, and 544 cm−1 are present in both UZ and MZ spectra. These bands are related to the stretching vibrations of the (Si, Al)O4 tetrahedral framework and double ring vibration of the octahedral zeolite structure (Wang, Yang, Zheng, Jiang, & Li, 2008). In MZ, some strong additional bands appeared at 1070 and 1257 cm−1 associated to SO3 stretch demonstrating the presence of sulfonic acid groups on the zeolite surface (Abu-Saied et al., 2017) (Sanaeepur, Kargari, & Nasernejad, 2014). Moreover, the silane modification results in a condensation reaction between the hydroxyl groups of zeolite with silanol groups which reduce the band intensity at 3655−3239 cm−1. This shows the successful modification of zeolites with a modifying agent (Sasikala et al., 2016; Wang, Zheng et al., 2008). In C-CPMZ0, the absorption band found at 1730 cm−1 is related to the characteristic vibration of the CO groups of MA, confirming the occurrence of a cross-linking reaction between the polymer matrix and MA. Actually, PVA and MA go through esterification reactions via grafting or crosslinking under heat treatment to form the ester group. In addition, the absorption bands appearing at 1246 demonstrate the development of bonding between CH2 and OH. Another specific band found at 1400 cm−1 exhibit the formation of ether bonds among hydroxyl (OH) of PVA and carboxyl (COOH) of either MA or CBC (Zhu, Xia, Liu, & Jin, 2010). In C-CPMZ (0 wt. %–50 wt. %) the broad band at 3624–3005 cm−1 shifts to lower wavenumberss and appeared at 3590–2992 cm−1 exhibiting the occurrence of ionic interaction or hydrogen bonding among OH of PVA and NH2 of CS (Maarouf, Tazi, & Guenoun, 2017). The distinct band located at 939 cm−1 in C-CPMZ10 (10 wt. %) was attributed to TO4 framework of zeolite content. This band shifted to higher wavenumbers and became more intense due to the increase in zeolite content from C-CPMZ30 (30 wt. % MZ) and C-CPMZ50 (50 wt% MZ) (Sanaeepur et al., 2014) While some common bands associated with characteristic vibrations of CO of CBC and PVA molecule appeared in the range of 1200–1000 cm−1, these bands overlapped with the TO stretching vibration in prepared composite membranes indicating the presence of zeolites (Sanaeepur, Kargari, Nasernejad, Amooghin, & Omidkhah, 2016). It is clear that Si-O-Si groups are the results of condensation reaction occurred between SiOH groups from hydrolyzed MPDMS and COH groups from PVA and CBC. Under an acidic environment, PVA reacted with a cross-linking agent and silanol groups and formed the COC and SiOC groups. The formation of SiOC and COC groups will be in favor to enhance compatibility between organic and inorganic parts, and a better homogeneity of inorganic and organic matrix at molecular scale leads h stable membrane. Fig. 3 showed the XRD patterns of UZ, MZ, and prepared MMMs. From Fig. 3(a), sharp peaks with high intensity were observed in the region of 10-40° indicating the high crystalline structure of the unmodified zeolite (UZ). In MZ, the characteristic peaks (10-40°) of UZ were also present, showing that the surface functionalization does not change crystalline structure. However, in MZ less intense characteristic peak also appeared at 15–35° indicating slightly amorphous crystalline structure which may be due to the existence of the silane modifying agent at the surface of MZ as shown in Fig. 3(a). The pristine chitosan membrane showed four distinctive bands at 11.7°, 18.6° 23.4° and 26.5° respectively while pure PVA showed characteristics crystalline peaks at 19.89° and 35°- 40° as shown in Fig. 3(b) (Casado-Coterillo, Andrés, Téllez, Coronas, & Irabien, 2014). However, in the C-CPMZ0 (0 wt. % MZ), the intensity of these peaks was decreased as compared to the pure PVA and pristine CS. The characteristic peaks of CBC/PVA in C-CPMZ (10−30 wt% MZ) exhibited much lower intensity than those in C-CPMZ0 although the position of the peaks remains unchanged. In addition, the peaks at around 20° and 35° become less intense in C-CPMZ (10−30 wt% MZ) membranes. The decreasing peak intensity with increasing MZ content was attributed to the development of intermolecular interaction between the polymer blend and modified zeolite (Schaffer et al., 2017). The crystallinity of the chitosan is highly affected by the hydrogen bonding between its OH, COOH, and -NH2 groups. However, with the introduction of the zeolite, these groups would presumably also interact with the OH groups on the surface of the zeolite, decreasing the intra- and inter-molecular interactions of the chitosan membrane. This interaction would interrupt the polymer crystal structure and enhance the compatibility among the tough zeolite and elastic polymer chains, making a suitable environment for methanol rejection. This also limits the mobility of the chitosan chain, further lowering methanol permeability. Thus the lowering intensity of the characteristic CS/PVA bands with increasing MZ content indicates that the induction of filler disrupts the crystalline nature of the polymers (Yen, Yang, & Mau, 2009). Fig. 4 shows the surface and cross sectional morphology of the UZ and MZ and CBC/PVA-MZ composite membranes. From Fig. 4(a), UZ showed three-dimensional crystalline structure. Another observable thing is the presence of some small aggregates made up of few attached particles. After the functionalization, the spherical particles formed irregular shapes because of the attachment of sulfonic acid groups (SO3H) at the surface. In addition, MZ exhibited larger aggregates because of newly developed adhesive forces among amine functional groups at surface zeolites as shown in Fig. 4(b) (Sanaeepur et al., 2014). The C-CPMZ0 (Fig. 4c) showed smooth surface morphology without any agglomerate due to good polymer compatibility. The surface of C-CPMZ10 (Fig. 4d) was uniform and smooth without noticeable moieties, voids, or MZ aggregation within the membrane. This showed the uniform dispersion of MZ within the polymer matrix. This result indicates that interactions among the zeolite and polymer matrix are reinforced due to silane modification, thus improving interfacial morphology. However, increasing the MZ content up to 30 wt. %, as presented in Fig. 4 C-CPMZ30 (Fig. 4e, f), the distribution of MZ content was no longer homogeneous and tended to agglomerate with each other. This agglomeration was clearer on further increasing MZ contents up to 50 wt. % as shown in Fig. 4(g, h, 1), thus affecting other properties such as methanol and water uptake and proton conduction. Fig. 4 from right side presents the cross-section SEM images of (a*) UZ, (b*) MZ, (c*) C-CPMZ0, (d*) C-CPMZ 10, (e*) C-CPMZ 30 and (f*) CPMZ 50). The modified zeolites surface is completely covered with a continuous crystalline layer. No defects and no holes between the zeolite crystals were observed ((b*). The cross-sectional image of the as-prepared membrane presents a smooth morphology. From the cross-sectional views of composite in Fig. 4 c*–f*, the C-CPMZ0 membrane shows a void-free dense structure while the particles of the CS/PVA based membranes loaded with MZ are visible, and the particle density obviously increased with the zeolite content. In addition, no voids or cracks existed between the filler particles and polymer matrix as shown in c* and d*. The direct mixing of the modified zeolite particles with the polymer matrix is beneficial for uniform zeolite particle distribution in the CS/PVA matrix, preventing filler aggregation (Deng et al., 2016). The much better interfacial morphology was obtained after zeolite incorporation, indicating an increase in compatibility between the polymer and inorganic filler. The membrane shows better interfacial morphology for the 13X zeolite / polymer composite membranes. Thus, a uniform distribution of 13X zeolite filled polymeric membranes exhibit enhanced flux and selectivity."
15,Evaluation on fuel cell related properties,"4.2 Evaluation on fuel cell related properties 4.2.1 Methanol permeability Fig. 5 (a) shows that the methanol permeation of recast Nafion® 117 membrane (27 × 10−7 cm2/s) is much greater as compared to prepared MMMs. The C-CPUZ0 (0 wt. %) shows lower methanol permeability value then Nafion® 117 membranes. The methanol permeability was further lowered on increasing unmodified zeolite content and the minimum value found was 3.0 × 10−7 cm2/s with C-CPUZ50 (50 wt. % UZ). The effect of silane modification on the methanol permeability of prepared MMMs was also examined. It was found that the methanol permeation of the composite membranes reduced by increasing MZ percentage and reached 2.3 × 10−7 cm2/s at the lowest value in C-CPMZ50 (50 wt. % MZ). The methanol permeation of Nafion® 117 is much more than the CS-based membranes indicating the suitable selection of CS as an outstanding methanol obstructive medium. (Maiti, Kakati, Lee, Jee, & Yoon, 2011). It was reported in the literature that methanol permeation of a Nafion® 117-based membrane was increased by increasing methanol concentration, however, in case of CS/PVA and other PVA-based membranes, the trend is the opposite (Kim et al., 2009). The lowering methanol permeability after the addition of zeolite relates with the following factors: (1) increasing of path length and tortuosity of methanol permeation due to the dispersion of inorganic particles; (2) the addition of the stiff structured zeolite results in the compaction of the polymer matrix and reduces the volume between polymer chains, lowering the swelling rate and methanol uptake of the membrane (Duangkaew & Wootthikanokkhan, 2008; García-Cruz, Casado-Coterillo, Iniesta, Montiel, & Irabien, 2016; Kim et al., 2009; Wang, Jiang, Li, & Yang, 2010). The silane-modified zeolites exhibited good compatibility toward the organic polymer blend. The transitional stage developed at the inorganic-organic border seals the minor spaces and joins the two components. The silane modification process also reduces the pore size and total pore volume of the zeolite which also favors a reduction in methanol uptake. The SO3H groups present at the surface of the modified zeolite develop strong interactions with the OH groups of CBC/PVA, resulting in the development of a compact structure with less methanol permeation (Prapainainar et al., 2016; Souto et al., 2017). Additionally the relatively low methanol permeability of the prepared membranes can be explained on the basis of the lack of significant interactions between methanol and ionic clusters, SO3H and COOH groups, from the inorganic and organic components, respectively, of the cross-linked membranes. Ionized groups hydrate strongly and exclude organic solvents, which is an essential feature of the polyelectrolyte membranes. The value of methanol permeability of pure Nafion117 and PVA membranes has been tested previously but the experimental conditions are different for different experiments. The methanol permeability of pristine Nafion 117 reported as 31 × 10−7 cm2/s (Wang et al., 2014) at room temperature is in good agreement with the present value of recast Nafion = 27 × 10−7 cm2/s at 25 °C. Cui et al. (2015) reported Nafion/Zeolite based PEMS for DMFC applications. They obtained minimum methanol permeability values of 2.28 × 10−7 cm2/s higher C-CPMZ50 (p = 2.3 × 10−7 cm2/s) composite in this study. They used expensive Nafion composite membrane herein we used low cost PVA based PEMs. Liao, Yang, Hu, Pai & Lue (2015) found a methanol permeability value of 2.99 × 10−6 cm2/s for Q-PA/5%Q- chitosan composites, which is higher than our study. Yang et al. reported that the methanol permeability of PVA/ 20 % montmorillonite(MMT) composites was 2.85 × 10-6 cm2/s at 25 °C (Yang, Lee, & Yang, 2009) which is higher than the than C-CPMZ50 composite (2.3 × 10−7 cm2/s) in this study. It is clear that pure Nafion and pure PVA have higher methanol permeability then our novel prepared composite membranes Nafion117 and PVA membrane. 4.2.2 Ion exchange capacity (IEC) The Ion exchange capacity (IEC) values of prepared CBC/PVA-zeolite membranes and recast Nafion®117 are presented in Fig. 5(b). The IEC values of prepared CS and crosslinked C-CPMZ0 composite membranes were found to be 0.167 and 0.62 mmolg−1 respectively. These value IEC values were much less than that of the Nafion®117 membrane, i.e. 0.887 mmol g−1 as reported in the literature (Wu et al., 2007). The IEC values of zeolite incorporated CBC/PVA membranes are somewhat less than that of pure CS and C-CPMZ0, and a decreasing trend is observed with increasing zeolite content from 10 wt. % to 50 wt. %. The IEC values of unmodified zeolite filled CBC/PVA membranes were lower than that of sulfonated zeolite filled CBC/PVA membrane because of the existence of SO3H and COOH groups on inorganic and organic parts, respectively, that provide more ion exchange moieties and thus enhance the water absorption capacity and proton conductivity (Holmberg, Hwang, Davis, & Yan, 2005; Wang, Yang et al., 2008). IEC provides an indication of the density of ionizable hydrophilic groups present in the membrane matrix which can be involved in proton conduction and acts as a secondary, indirect means of measuring proton conductivity. 4.2.3 Water uptake percentage PEMs with high water uptake and low methanol permeability are desired for DMFC applications. The influence of modified and unmodified zeolite on water uptake of prepared membranes is shown in Fig. 5(c). The pure PVA showed higher water uptake compared to Nafion®, CS, and all prepared MMMs. The water uptake lowered upon the addition of UZ and MZ contents. The high water uptake of pure pristine PVA membrane is related to its hydrophilicity (Srinophakun, Thanapimmetha, Plangsri, Vetchayakunchai, & Saisriyoot, 2017). The higher water uptake the pure chitosan membrane is also related to the hydrophilicity of its hydroxyl and amine groups. However, upon blending of PVA with CBC and cross-linking with MA, the uptake was evidently lower due to less flexible structures of the crosslinking network. PEMs having a high carboxyl group concentration help the development of intermolecular hydrogen bonding which in turn lowers the number of water bonding sites. The existence of CBC and MZ reduces the rate of water desorption. Hence, both CBC and MZ play a role of binder for water in the membrane matrix because of inter- and intramolecular interactions. The free water in the ionic (COOH and SO3H groups) membrane matrix is less mobile and showed that if more water is bound in the hydrophilic domains it is less apt to dehydrate. When PVA is crosslinked with MA, its solubility rate declines greatly and the membrane becomes more stable in humid conditions. The stability is because of the development of ester linkages among PVA and MA during grafting or crosslinking (de Oliveira et al., 2016; Üçtuğ & Nijem, 2017). Studies showed that crosslinking MA with an entirely miscible polymer blend results in a dehydration reaction among COOH and OH. A maleic acid group processes two ion-exchangeable sites and crosslinking can occur with OH group of PVA. In addition, the introduction of malic acid into the polymer matrix makes it possible to control the charge density of the prepared membrane (Şimşek, Rzayev, & Bunyatova, 2016; Wu, Xie, Ng, Shen, & Zhou, 2017). The crosslinking of MMMs dictates the mechanical properties of the whole membranes (Srinophakun et al., 2017). The lowering of water uptake upon the addition of UZ and MZ contents is associated with the lower hydrophilicity of MZ and UZ than the pure, PVA, CS and cross-linked PVA/CBC (C-CPMZ0). The filling of MZ and UZ causes the polymer chain to become more rigid. In case of MZ filled MMMs, the negative trend in water uptake is because of the reinforcement of adhesive forces among the polymer and the MZ, thus the number of pores and resulting in a void-free framework. Like the other inorganic fillers, the higher MZ and UZ contents may also cause the development of aggregated structures within the MMMs (Srinophakun et al., 2017), thus lowering the water uptake value with increasing UZ and MZ content. However, water uptake value for MMMs with modified zeolite (MZ) was higher than MMMs with unmodified zeolite (UZ). The MMM with 10 wt% MZ (C-CPMZ10) content showed the highest water uptake values. A similar trend was also seen in case of UZ based MMMs. Binsu et al. (Binsu, Nagarale, Shahi, & Ghosh, 2006) reported the water uptake value of 41.2 % of pure Nafion membrane at room temperature, which is in good agreement with our study. Cui et al. (Cui et al., 2015) reported Nafion/Zeolite based PEMS for DMFC; they obtained the water uptake value in range of 20–28 %. Similarly Yoon et al. studies showed that water uptake behavior of PVA based membrane for DMFC application is in the range of 30–60 % (Kakati, Maiti, Das, Lee, & Yoon, 2015). Similarly Liew et al., reported the water uptake values of PVA based PEMS in range of 47–58 % (Liew, Ramesh, & Arof, 2014). These reported value of PVA based PEMS are lower than C-CPMZ10 composite in this study. 4.2.4 Proton conductivity measurements The pristine CS membrane and PVA under fully hydrated conditions showed proton conductivity values of 0.0299 and 0.009 Scm−1, respectively. Fig. 6 (a) presents the proton conductivity values of prepared MMMs, and it shows that proton conductivity decreases with increasing zeolite content (30−50 wt. %). The effect of temperature on proton conduction was also studied. It was found that the ionic conductivity of all composite membranes improved slightly with increasing temperature up to 80 °C. The maximum proton conductivity value found was 0.0170 Scm−1 shown by C-CPMZ10 (10 wt. %) at 80 °C. From Fig. 8(b), the proton conductivity value of Nafion® 117 was 0.064S cm−1 at room temperature and increased from 25 to 80 °C. The highly conductive recast standard Nafion® membrane showed a maximum conductivity 0.152 S cm−1 at 80 °C. From Fig. 8(c), a similar trend was seen in the case of modified zeolite membranes. However, MMMs with modified zeolite contents showed more conductivity compared to MMMs with unmodified ones. The maximum value of proton conductivity, 0.0527 Scm−1, obtained was shown by C-CMPZ10. The ionic conductivity of CS-based membrane correlates to the number of NH2 and OH groups in the PEMs (Göktepe, Çelik, & Bozkurt, 2008). When a chitosan solution is prepared in weak acid, its amine groups could be protonated and these protons can move across the membrane, leading to the ionic conductivity of the membrane (Eldin et al., 2017). In chitosan, protons may transfer via the Grotthuss or jump mechanism where they pass down the OH or NH2 groups by jumping from one site to another. Chitosan modified with N-p-carboxy benzyl chitosan (NCBC) introduces an aromatic ring grafted with carboxylic acid to act as the proton conducting group. On the other hand, PEMs have the ability to hold much water due to the inherent hydrophilic behavior of CS, so proton transfer may possible by vehicle mechanism (Schaffer et al., 2017) This mechanism involves the proton forming complexes with the solvent molecules, like H3O+ or CH3OH2 +, getting moving through the membrane via diffusion. Therefore, it is believed that the vehicle mechanism is highly related to the availability of water or methanol molecules within PEMs (Smitha, Sridhar, & Khan, 2005; Wang et al., 2010; Wang, Zheng et al., 2008). The hydrophilicity of PVA makes possible to hold a large amount water and hence enables the membrane to transfer a large number of protons via vehicular mechanism. This shows that hydrophilicity is one of the major contributors to increasing proton conductivity even when the material is a nonelectrolyte. The CBC/PVA composite membranes can absorb more water as compared to the recast Nafion membrane. The addition of PVA into the chitosan membrane results in the formation of hydrophilic, causing more water absorption, enabling easier proton transfer, and leading to higher ionic conductivity (Liu, Dai, Chao, & Chang, 2014). The blended CBC/PVA-MZ membranes retain the intrinsic characteristics of both PVA and CS. PVA has semicrystalline framework while chitosan possesses a less compact structure with a comparatively higher free volume. Hence the blending of chitosan and PVA lowers the crystalline nature of PVA and enables more water absorption (Zhu et al., 2010). Although the addition of MZ in CBC/PVA lowers water uptake as compare to pure CS and PVA but still higher than recast Nafion membrane. The organic-inorganic composite PEMs, having acidic functional groups (SO3H and COOH), dissociated due to hydration, permitting the transport of hydrated protons (H3O+). Polyelectrolyte membranes with high IEC showed a higher conductivity because of the more fixed charge carrier. It was also observed that, due to its more acidic nature, membranes with higher concentrations of SO3H groups had higher conductivities than those containing the less acidic COOH groups. Because of this, the conductivity may be able to be further enhanced by crosslinking and adding filler containing SO3H groups to increase the number of ions in the membrane. However, the addition of zeolite considerably lowers the methanol and water uptake of the membrane, so a decrease in proton conductivity was observed in this study. The existence of zeolite in the polymer matrix elongated the protons pathway, thus reducing proton conduction. Consequently, the proton conduction in CBC/PVA-MZ composite membranes is lowered by increasing MZ content owing to lower water uptake (Wang et al., 2010). At room temperature, high water sorption assists protons transfer via process structural diffusion. At high-temperatures, proton conductivity relates to the higher ionic mobility (diffusivity), the greater segmental motion of polymer chain, and higher polymer free volume, enlarging the transport path for ions to pass more easily. Increasing temperature also reduces the crystalline phase and increase the segmental motion of the polymer chain, however, further increases in temperature lowers the value of conductivity. The due to the loss of water by evaporation (Liao et al., 2015). As proton conductivity is thermally activated, it is clear to expect an increase in the conductivity with temperature. The deterioration of conductivity values above 80 °C observed for all prepared MMMs was accompanied by a dehydration of the membrane. Thus, not only the capacity for water uptake but also the capacity of the membrane to retain water at elevated temperatures is crucial for proton conductivity. This can be explained by the presence of free and bound water content in the membranes. According to the vehicular mechanism, free water can act as a proton transferring medium. However, free water vaporizes faster than bound water. The proton conductivity of all PEMs recedes at higher temperature due to the loss of free water (Hu, Luo, Wagner, Agert, & Conrad, 2011). The effect of temperature can be further explained by the fact that when the temperature raises up to 80 °C, the vibrational motion of the polymer matrix and movement of water in membrane increase, and gradually the system reaches equilibrium with thermodynamically and morphologically comparatively stable condition at around 80 °C. During this period of equilibrium, the randomly arranged water gradually becomes interconnected, forming relatively broader H-bonded networks of water, and establishing larger proton-conducting ion–water channels, which directly trigger the increase in proton conductivity (Kunimatsu, Bae, Miyatake, Uchida, & Watanabe, 2011). The pendant side chains, which anchor the sulfonate groups to the fluorocarbon backbone, are labile enough to rearrange and stabilize water clusters as the amount of water increases (Moilanen, Piletic, & Fayer, 2007). However, when the temperature increased above 80 °C, though the movement of water and polymer matrices increases, the additional movement of water and possible morphological changes were not favorable to make the Hbonded network larger, and as a result, the proton conductivity also failed to increase (Sen, Leach, & Varjian, 1995). 4.2.5 Fuel cell performance It is obvious that the presence of sulfonated composite, a strong proton-conducting medium in the composite membrane, lets them to achieve higher conductivity of protons which improves the efficiency of DMFC. Although the crossover of methanol across the pristine PVA membrane is less than that seen across the Nafion-117 membrane, literature reveals that the efficiency of DMFCs using pristine PVA-based PEMs is lower than that of DMFCs using Nafion-117-based PEM and is due to lower PVA conductivity and weak membrane adhesion with catalyzed electrodes (Sahu et al., 2008). The Nafion membranes have their own drawbacks (set out already in the introduction section). So the option would be to prepare composite membranes as an alternative to Nafion membranes. Keep in mind that we are designing PVA based membrane for the use of intrinsic PVA properties appropriate for DMFC applications such as lower permeability of methanol. The performance of all prepared PEMs membrane was tested using different methanol concentrations i.e 10 % (0.247 M), 20 % (0.742 M) and 60 % (1.485 M) in feed at 80 °C and the obtained results are presented in Fig. 7(a–c) . The variations of power density and current density were observed upon changing filler content (10, 30, 50 wt. %) under similar experimental conditions. The MMMs showed slow decrease in cell voltage along with increase in current density, and also exhibited high power density. Among all prepared MMMs C-CPMZ10 showed highest value of power density and current density which is in good agreement with conductivity results. At low methanol concentration, low methanol crossover across the all PEMs increased the open circuit voltage (OCV) and significantly improved the performance. In this study, all PEMs showed almost comparable open circuit voltage of CV (0.45 V). The approximately comparable performance of these membranes to the Nafion® 117 reveals their suitability for DMFC application. The existence of a PVA constituent in the blend membrane is supposed to provide resistance to the perceived attack of in situ-generated H2O2 during cell activity due to its excellent stability toward peroxides. In addition, because of the higher water absorption of the composite membrane, the concentration of H2O2 produced inside the fuel cell during operation is decreased. In addition to these characteristics, the well-connected network is expected to reduce gas crossover during cell activity, thus avoiding the creation of deleterious radicals known to affect the Nafion membranes. The above characteristics, together with the findings shown in this review, render this blend membrane competitive with Nafion membranes Added to these features, the well cross-linkedd network is expected to reduce the gas crossover during the cell operation, thereby preventing the formation of deleterious radicals that are known to affect the Nafion membranes (Inaba et al., 2006). A detailed study on these aspects is currently underway in the authors’ laboratory. The above-mentioned features, along with the results reported in this study, make this blend membrane competitive with Nafion membranes (Sahu et al., 2008). The zeolite induction into the PVA/CS blend resulted in lower polymer crystallinities, which enhanced the amorphous phase and the free volume, permitting protons to pass through the polymer matrix more easily. Secondly, the easier proton transfer through the polymer matrix ensured higher ionic conductivity. Thirdly, zeolite-based membranes had lower methanol permeability than the pristine PVA. Reduced methanol permeability showed that the methanol solubility and/or the diffusion coefficient was reduced. Zeolite addition causes a dilution effect on solvent uptake and the size-selectiveness in the composite with increased polymer free-volume resulting in the preferential transport of ions while limiting methanol passing through the membranes. Therefore, the decreased fuel crossover can minimize the methanol oxidation potential on the cathode and improve cell voltage (García-Cruz et al., 2016). 4.2.6 Durability test The stability of synthesized composite was analyzed after long-duration cell operation at 40 °C. The obtained results are given in Fig. 8 . The variation in the discharge voltage was measured at a constant current of 50 mA with time. The data was recorded with 30 min off-periods every 24 h over a continuous operating period of 120 h. The cell potential decreased from 0.55 to 0.44 V during the first cycle, then the cell potential increased to 0.567 V during the off-period. There was a greater voltage loss in the fourth cycle than in the previous three cycles. According to Liao et al. (2016) the consequence of a reduced concentration of fuel is a small voltage loss. Therefore, we replaced the spent fuel cell anode with a fresh one, and the cell potential increased from 0.209 to 0.237 V. Due to the voltage drop fluctuation shown in the fourth cycle, the discharge voltage curve was split into two parts to determine the individual rate of decay. The decay rate in the first four cycles was about 2.88 × 10−3 V h−1 and 1.53 × 10−3 V h−1 in the last two cycles. The average rate of decay was approximately 2.06 × 10−3 V h−1. The fuel cell was dissembled at the end of long-term cell testing, and the membrane was examined. During this long operating time the composite membrane remained intact and displayed stability."
16,Conclusion,"Zeolite was functionalized using 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS) silane-coupling agents and introduced into a CBC/PVA matrix to prepare enhanced performance PEMs with high methanol rejection ability for DMFC. Surface modification of zeolite results in the improvement of interfacial compatibility with the polymeric blend, thus lowering permeation of methanol and improving proton conductivity. The CBC/PVA-MZ membranes exhibited more hindrance to methanol diffusion than membranes containing unmodified zeolite. The proton conductivity values of prepared MMS were lower as compared to standard Nafion®117 based electrolytes. However, methanol permeation of these MMMs was much lower 2.3 × 10−7 cm2/s (C-CPMZ 50 wt. %), than that of Nafion®117. The prepared MMMs also showed good cell performance results and remained intact and displayed stability during long term operating time. Considering, low cost, environment-friendly nature, and ease of fabrication, these factionalized, zeolite filled CBC/PVA-MZ mixed matrix membranes may be encouraging PEMs for DMFC development."
