0,Introduction,"Primary alcohols, particularly aliphatic primary alcohols, are among the most commonly used organic compounds in industry. They are valuable solvents, intermediates for the synthesis of other reagents (formaldehyde, resins, ether, etc.), and fuels (Sheldon, Arends, & Dijksman, 2000). While the chemical oxidation of alcohols into aldehydes and carboxylic acids (primary alcohols) and ketones (secondary alcohols) is one of the most important transformations due to the versatility of these products (Zhong, Liu, Bai, Liao, & Li, 2015), most of the reported procedures require specific catalysts (Enache et al., 2006; Velusamy, Srinivasan, & Punniyamurthy, 2006; Xu, Lumb, & Arndtsen, 2015), heat, harsh conditions (concentrated acids or bases), and/or an excess of oxidants (hypochlorite, chromate, permanganate, etc.) (Ciriminna, Pandarus, Béland, Xu, & Pagliaro, 2015; Heidarnezhad & Zamani, 2015; Nogueira et al., 2019). In general, these processes are not only relatively expensive, but also typically use organic solvents and lead to the generation of waste containing heavy metals (Brink et al., 2000). Many groups have also investigated the electrochemical oxidation of alcohols (Puthiyapura, Lin, Russell, Brett, & Hardacre, 2018) but this process rarely allows the formation of aldehydes with high efficiency and the reaction may be affected by the adsorption of reaction products to the electrode (Garcia et al., 2016; Puthiyapura et al., 2018). Therefore the electrochemical oxidation of alcohols is typically optimized to proceed towards CO2 as the final oxidation product (Crabtree, 2017), and therefore has limited analytical applicability. Targeting water treatment applications, a number of groups have also combined oxidants with catalysts and/or light, in what is now mostly referred to as advanced oxidation processes (Pho et al., 2016). Although these approaches appear to be promising (fast kinetics and competitive efficiency), they also tend to proceed until the complete oxidation of the organic molecules, making them unsuitable for analytical applications. Because alcohols lack chromophore groups and feature relatively low boiling points, alcohols are routinely analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to flame ionization detectors or by liquid chromatography coupled with refractive index detectors (Wiśniewska, Śliwińska, Dymerski, Wardencki, & Namieśnik, 2015). Other approaches based on spectrophotometry (Choengchan et al., 2006), density (González-Rodrı́guez, Pérez-Juan, & Luque de Castro, 2003), calorimetry (Oliveira et al., 2018), colorimetry (Benedetti et al., 2015; Cardoso et al., 2017), or the oxidation by enzymes (Barroso et al., 2018; Gomez et al., 2018) have been also reported, but they often present shortcomings like narrow linear ranges or limited selectivity. Albeit some of these shortcomings can be addressed by integrating a fast separation step by capillary electrophoresis (CE) with electrochemical derivatization and conductivity detection (Ferreira Santos, Silva Lopes, & Gutz, 2017; Santos, da Costa, Gutz, & Garcia, 2017; Santos, Lopes, Vidal, do Lago, & Gutz, 2012), the analysis still requires specific instrumentation and skilled personnel to integrate the steps. Aiming to provide a simple alternative for the analysis of alcohols in real samples, this report describes the combination of a photochemical sample pretreatment step (derivatization to carboxylic acids using a UV-LED and H2O2) with separation and detection steps performed in a standard CE instrument. To allow the use of the UV detector (standard in most commercial CE instruments), indirect detection was implemented by modifying the background electrolyte with benzoic acid. The utility of the proposed methodology was demonstrated by analyzing the ethanol concentration in a variety of alcoholic beverages, ranging from beer (5%) to whiskey (53%). The method also enables the simultaneous determination of methanol, critical to enforce quality standards in distilled spirits."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemicals and solutions,"2.1 Chemicals and solutions All solutions were prepared using deionized water (>18 MΩ.cm) from Barnstead NANOpure UV, Thermolyne (Dubuque, IA) and reagents of analytical grade or better. Methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, formic acid, acetic acid, and propionic acid were obtained from Merck (Kenilworth, NJ). Benzoic acid, l-histidine (His), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), 2-morpholin-4-ylethanesulfonic acid (MES) and NaOH were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO). Hydrochloric acid and hydrogen peroxide (35% v/v) were purchased from J. T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ) and EMD Millipore (Temecula, CA), respectively."
3,Apparatus and procedure for photochemical experiments,"2.2 Apparatus and procedure for photochemical experiments All experiments involving the photochemical treatment of alcohols were performed using a homemade UV-LED reactor (Fig. 1 ). The UV radiation source consisted of a commercial high power LED (10 W, EPISTAR Corporation, Taiwan, China) with 9 diodes arranged on a chip as a 3 × 3 array (1.6 cm2) that presents maximum emission at 367 nm (UV-A). The UV-LED chip was mounted over an aluminum heat sink (flat surface, 3.5 cm × 3.5 cm) and maintained at nearly room temperature with a computer cooling fan. Taking into account the low effect of the temperature on the oxidation reaction (García Einschlag, Féliz, & Capparelli, 1997), this was not only considered appropriate but also a significant advantage over other oxidants (i.e. K2Cr2O7) that require elevated temperatures. A commercial 12 V D.C. switching power supply (S-25-12, Mean Well; Fremont, CA) with voltage adjustment was used to operate the UV-LED at 700 mA as well as the computer fan placed below the chip. A switch (on/off) was also installed to control both UV-LED array and the exhaust fan when needed. All photochemical treatments were carried out in a quartz cuvette (1.0 cm optical path), although at 367 nm glass or plastic cuvettes or flasks could be used instead. For the photochemical experiments, 200 µL of the sample (or standard), 570 µL of H2O2 (35% v/v, yielding a final concentration of 2%), and 100 µL of HCl 0.1 mol L−1 were mixed in a 10 mL volumetric flask and filled to the mark with DI water. From this solution, a 2 mL aliquot (standard or real samples) was dispensed in the quartz cuvette. As shown in Fig. 1, the cuvette was then placed over the UV-LED array."
4,Capillary electrophoresis and procedure,"2.3 Capillary electrophoresis and procedure A standard capillary electrophoresis equipment with UV detection (CE-UV; SCIEX P/ACE MDQ AB; Brea, CA) was used for all experiments. The UV detector was positioned 50 cm apart from the injection tip of a 50 µm i.d., 60 cm long fused silica capillary (Polymicro Technologies; Phoenix, AZ). The 214 nm wavelength was selected to monitor the carboxylic acids formed after UV-treatment (indirect detection based on the absorbance of benzoic acid, present in the background electrolyte). Samples were injected hydrodynamically during 10 s at 1 psi (6.9 kPa). The voltage applied during the separation was 30 kV. Before the analysis, the capillary was preconditioned by sequential rinsing steps with 0.1 mol L−1 NaOH solution, deionized water, and background electrolyte (10 min each). The peaks in the electropherograms were assigned based on a simulation with the software PeakMaster (Gaš, 2011. downloaded from https://web.natur.cuni.cz/~gas/ (Accessed January 2018)) and confirmed by recording electropherograms upon spiking with a standard solution containing the carboxylic acids. It is also important to note that results are expressed as “corrected peak areas”, which are calculated as the peak area divided by the respective migration time (Schaeper & Sepaniak, 2000). This correction accounts for the different electrophoretic mobilities of the anions and could become relevant if the total area for the electropherogram is to be considered."
5,Real samples,"2.4 Real samples A set of twelve alcoholic beverages was selected to demonstrate the applicability of the described approach. The samples included: beer (Blue Moon Mango wheat, 5.4% v/v); liqueur (Aperol, 11% v/v); prosecco (La Marca, 11% v/v); white wine (Kirkland, Pinot Grigio, 12.5% v/v); red wine (Trapiche Malbec, 13% v/v); Martini (Extra dry, 15% v/v); coconut rum (Captain Morgan, 21% v/v); peach whisky (Evan Williams, 35% v/v); cognac (Courvoisier VSOP, 40% v/v); tequila (Patron Añejo, 40% v/v); moonshine (Midnight Moon, 51% v/v); and single malt whisky (Balcones, 53% v/v). Prior to the analysis, 10 mL of each sample were placed into an ultrasonic bath for a few minutes to remove most of the CO2 present. Then, samples were diluted (as needed) to fit into the calibration curve and ranging from 1:715 (beer) to 1:4000 (tequila, moonshine, and whisky). Upon the UV-LED/H2O2 treatment, a 750 µL aliquot of each irradiated sample was transferred to a vial and analyzed by CE-UV. Calibration curves ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 mmol L−1 were obtained for acetic acid and ethanol after the UV-LED/H2O2 treatment. For the sake of comparison, all samples were injected into the CE-UV before and after UV-treatment. All injections (standard solutions and real samples) were carried out in duplicate."
6,Results and discussion,"Since the primary alcohols are neutral species, one strategy to analyze them by CE is to convert them into charged ones, in this case, to the corresponding carboxylic acids (Santos, Lopes, & Gutz, 2014; Santos et al., 2012). It is important to note that the oxidation of primary alcohols can produce aldehydes, carboxylic acids, and/or CO2 in proportions that depend on the mechanism (e.g., chemical, electrochemical, or photochemical), the reaction time, the temperature, and the environment (pH, competing species, etc.) (Ferreira Santos, Cordeiro, Cieslarová, Gutz, & Garcia, 2019). Regarding the photochemical oxidation in the presence of excess of H2O2, selected for this work with the expectation that it would be the simplest and cleanest alternative, it is known from the literature that the reaction kinetics can be described by a second order rate law, with respect to the organic compounds and the OH radicals (Oppenländer, 2007). Moreover, the rate constant slightly favors the oxidation of ethanol (1.9 × 109 L mol−1 s−1) over methanol (0.97 × 109 L mol−1 s−1) (Oppenländer, 2007). For the derivatization procedure herein described, a careful balance between reaction conditions and carboxylate yield was ascertained considering that, as part of a CE methodology, the analysis time should be short and that the production of CO2 should be avoided. In order to determine the optimum composition of the background electrolyte for CE, experiments were performed using standards of formic, acetic and propionic acids. These acids were selected because they correspond to oxidation products of the alcohols of interest based on their relevance to quality control of alcoholic beverages (methanol and ethanol) or their potential to be used as internal standards (1-propanol). Next, the mechanism involved in the oxidation process was probed to determine the number of detectable compounds produced from each analyte. Then, and considering the potential applicability of the methodology, the experimental conditions involved in the photo-oxidation reaction were investigated using ethanol as the model analyte. Finally, and after determining the analytical figures of merit, the applicability of the proposed strategy has been proven by analyzing a broad range of real samples."
7,Separation conditions,"3.1 Separation conditions The background electrolyte used for the analysis was chosen considering the pKa values and electrophoretic mobility of the carboxylic acids generated in the photochemical treatment, the total analysis time, and the sensitivity of the (indirect) detection step. A histidine (His) buffer was selected since it provides adequate buffer capacity around pH 6, a value that is higher than the pKa values of the carboxylic acids (pKa = ∼4.7), thus ensuring that they will be negatively charged and allowing their separation by zone electrophoresis. Since the UV-detector is the most frequently available one for CE but the target carboxylates have no significant absorptivity in the UV–vis, benzoic acid (pKa = 4.2) was the selected anionic chromophore for indirect detection (de Jesus et al., 2018). Benzoic acid is readily available, soluble in water, and features a high molar absorptivity in the UV region (log ε = 2.96) that remains constant under a wide range of experimental conditions (Ungnade & Lamb, 1952), thus simplifying the indirect detection of the organic acids. Benzoic acid also favors high resolution because of its electrophoretic mobility (−33.6·10−9 m2 V−1 s−1) (Desiderio, Fanali, Gebauer, & Boček, 1997), which is close to that of the target carboxylates (Foret, Fanali, Ossicini, & Boček, 1989). Besides that, the electro-osmotic flow was reversed by the addition of 0.2 mmol L−1 CTAB to the background electrolyte since otherwise at pH 6.5 the electro-osmotic flow cannot overcome the electromigration of the anionic analytes and drive them to the detector (electro-osmotic flow moving to the cathode and analytes moving to the anode). This approach is typically referred to as co-electro-osmotic flow capillary electrophoresis (da Costa et al., 2012; Quirino & Breadmore, 2012) and several modifiers such as long-chain alkylammonium salts have been proposed to develop these semi-permanent (dynamic) coating on the silica surface by taking advantage of strong electrostatic interactions between the capillary wall and the adsorbate. Under these conditions the negatively charged carboxylates as well as the electro-osmotic flow move toward the anode, providing baseline separation of the analytes in a short time. Fig. 2 summarizes the results obtained during the optimization of the background electrolyte composition considering the migration time and peak area of the target carboxylates. For these experiments, a standard solution containing 200 µmol L−1 of formate, acetate, and propionate was used. At first, the effect of the concentration of His was evaluated in the 10–50 mmol L−1 range and the effect of the concentration of benzoic acid was evaluated in the 5–25 mmol L−1 range. As it can be observed in Fig. 2A, by increasing the concentration of His, a slight decrease in the migration time (approximately 10%) for acetate and propionate was observed until a plateau was reached at 30 mmol L−1. Because the increase in the buffer concentration also produced a significant decrease in the peak areas of the selected carboxylates (Fig. 2B), a background electrolyte containing 30 mmol L−1 His was selected as a compromise between peak area and migration time. This solution was used for all further experiments. Next, the effect of the concentration of benzoic acid on both the migration time and peak area was investigated. In Fig. 2C and D it can be observed that increasing concentrations of the chromophore produced an approximately linear growth of the migration time and an almost linear decrease in the response to the carboxylates. These effects were attributed to a progressive increase in the ionic strength (which caused the decrease in the electro-osmotic flow) and the reduced fraction of the benzoate displaced by the analytes, respectively. Aiming to obtain a low analysis time with good sensitivity for the species expected after UV-treatment, the background electrolyte composition was defined as 30 mmol L−1 His, 15 mmol L−1 benzoic acid, and 0.2 mmol L−1 CTAB."
8,Photo-oxidation products,"3.2 Photo-oxidation products It has been previously reported that the photochemical degradation of primary alcohols using high pressure mercury lamps (and specially in the presence of H2O2) can lead not only to the formation of the corresponding organic acids but also of other byproducts such as aldehydes, shorter chain carboxylic acids, and CO2 (Aghighi, Haghighat, Zhong, & Lee, 2015; Ponczek & George, 2018). This issue is particularly important for the analysis of ethanol in beverages, because the presence of formate could indicate potential contamination with methanol. Therefore, and aiming to determine the reaction products, standard solutions containing 1 mmol L−1 of either methanol, ethanol, or 1-propanol were irradiated for 15 min in the presence of 2% (v/v) H2O2 and 10 mmol L−1 HCl. Fig. 3 summarizes the results obtained. As it can be observed, the electropherogram of the blank solution presents a large peak at 1.8 ± 0.1 min and a peak at 2.8 ± 0.1 min, attributed to chloride and phosphate, respectively. The latter is a common stabilizing additive in commercial solutions of hydrogen peroxide. Photo-oxidation of 1 mmol L−1 of methanol under the optimized conditions resulted in one additional peak at 2.2 min (b), which was assigned to formate. Photo-oxidation of 1 mmol L−1 of ethanol under the optimized conditions also resulted in one additional peak at 2.7 min (c), which was assigned to acetate. On the other hand, in addition to propionate (co-migrating with phosphate), acetate and formate were generated during the photo-oxidation of 1 mmol L−1 1-propanol (d). Although for 2-propanol and under irradiation of a low-pressure mercury vapor lamp (strongly emitting down to 254 nm), the formation of acetic acid and formic acid has been reported before (Kawaguchi, 1993), a similar result was obtained here with a relatively mild radiation from a 365 nm LED source. These results suggest that the reaction mechanism in homogeneous phase is also significantly different from the electrochemical one (Ferreira Santos et al., 2017; Santos et al., 2017; Santos et al., 2012). While these findings suggest that additional experiments may be needed to process samples containing significant amounts of 1-propanol, this alcohol is not expected to be found above trace levels in alcoholic beverages. For these cases, 0.1 mmol L−1 MES can be used as internal standard, to correct possible variations during the CE analyses."
9,Photochemical oxidation conditions,"3.3 Photochemical oxidation conditions The conditions for the combined action of H2O2 and UV irradiation during the oxidation process were ascertained using ethanol (as a model analyte) by considering the effect of the amount of H2O2 added, the pH of the medium and the UV irradiation time, keeping the irradiance of the UV-LED source constant. It is well-known that under UV light, the initial stage of H2O2 photodecomposition occurs mainly through generation of hydroxyl radicals (H2O2 → 2OH ) and, to a lesser degree, with the detachment of atomic oxygen (H2O2 → O + H2O) or hydrogen (H2O2 → H + HO2 ). These radicals are short-lived, react non-selectively with organic molecules, and their concentration is, as expected, dependent on the initial [H2O2] (Oppenländer, 2007). Thus, the effect of the H2O2 concentration on the oxidation of ethanol to acetate was first investigated. In this case, standard solutions containing 1 mmol L−1 of ethanol were mixed with H2O2 to final concentrations of 0, 0.15, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0% (v/v), placed in a quartz cuvette, and exposed to the UV light for 15 min (following the procedure described in Section 2.2). Next, the irradiated solutions were analyzed by CE-UV and the peak areas corresponding to the acetate (generated carboxylate) were plotted as a function of the H2O2 concentration (Fig. 4 A). As it can be observed, exposing the sample to UV light (without H2O2) did not render a detectable amount of acetate while increasing concentrations of H2O2 led to an asymptotic growth in the acetate produced, effect that leveled out when more than 0.5% (v/v) of H2O2 was used. Based on this result, 2% was selected and used for subsequent experiments. Next, the effect of the UV irradiation time on the oxidation of ethanol to acetate was investigated. For these experiments, standard solutions containing 1 mmol L−1 of ethanol and 2% of H2O2 were placed in the quartz cuvette and irradiated by using the proposed UV-LED photoreactor. A summary of the results obtained (peak area of acetate formed after UV-treatment) as a function of the irradiation time is presented in Fig. 4B. As already stated, the oxidation reaction proceeds only under irradiation, as no acetate was detected in the control experiment (no UV irradiation). It can also be observed in Fig. 4B, that the longer the irradiation time, the higher the conversion of ethanol to acetate, indicating that the rate of further oxidation to CO2 is of secondary importance at least during the first 90 min. Based on these results, 15 min was selected as a compromise between yield and time required for the derivatization, although it is evident that the yield could be increased by extending the irradiation time, in case a lower detection limit is needed. To evaluate the influence of the pH during the photochemical conversion of ethanol into acetate, standard solutions of ethanol at 1 mmol L−1 containing 2% (v/v) of H2O2 were prepared in acidic (10 mmol L−1 HCl), alkaline (10 mmol L−1 NaOH) and nearly neutral media and irradiated during 15 min. The results obtained (peak area) corresponding to the acetate generated in each condition after derivatization are shown in Fig. 4C. As it can be observed, a much lower yield of carboxylates was obtained in alkaline medium. These results are in line with previous reports describing that alkaline conditions favor the deprotonation of H2O2 (pKa ∼ 10.4) and the subsequent formation of hydroperoxide, which has a significantly higher absorption coefficient (affecting the fraction of light being absorbed by peroxide) and that decomposes to water, hydroxyl radicals, and hydroxide (effectively decreasing the concentration and strength of the oxidant). Once the derivatization yield is better at pH 2 than in water (pH ∼ 5.6 due to CO2 absorption), but a higher acidity could compromise the buffer capacity of the background electrolyte for CE, 10 mmol L−1 HCl was chosen as irradiation medium and used for all further experiments."
10,Analytical figures of merit,"3.4 Analytical figures of merit To determine the analytical figures of merit, a calibration curve was developed from solutions containing known amounts of ethanol (after UV-treatment for 15 min in the presence of 10 mmol L−1 HCl and 2% (v/v) H2O2) in the 0.1–2.0 mmol L−1 range (Fig. 5 ). As it can be observed, the method provides excellent linearity in the considered range (R2 = 0.999) with a calculated limit of detection of 50 µmol L−1 (3σ/sensitivity). Although these values are comparable to those described elsewhere (Santos et al., 2017; Santos et al., 2012), the proposed methodology does not require coupling an electrochemical/conductivity detector. The repeatability of the proposed methodology was evaluated by analyzing a set of standard solutions (n = 5) of 1 mmol L−1 ethanol under the optimized condition and subsequently injected 10 times each one. A relative standard deviation (RSD) better than 5.5% for peak area (n = 50) was obtained. Fig. 5 also shows the calibration curve obtained under identical conditions but injecting standards of acetic acid. Comparison of this slope (4046 ± 5 AU mmol−1 L, R2 = 0.999) with the one obtained with photo-oxidized ethanol (672 ± 15 AU mmol−1 L) allows estimating a yield for the photo-oxidation of 17%. Coincidently, a similar yield has been obtained before by electrochemical oxidation (Santos et al., 2012), but here it can be easily increased, e.g., to 50% by simply extending the irradiation time to 90 min (Fig. 4B)."
11,Application to real samples,"3.5 Application to real samples To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology towards the analysis of ethanol, twelve different alcoholic beverages with alcohol content varying from 5% to 55% (v/v) were analyzed. All the real samples were diluted before analysis to fit them into the calibration curve (715 to 4000 times, as described in the Section 2.4). Fig. 6 A summarizes the results in a graph of the relative peak areas (calculated as experimental peak area multiplied by the dilution corresponding to each sample performed) versus the respective alcohol content declared on the label. It is also important to mention that the contribution of acetic acid in the original samples (while expected to be minimal if the sample is well-preserved) can be discounted by running the underivatized sample. The samples herein reported did not render observable responses unless derivatized under the selected conditions (see example in Fig. 6B). As it can be observed, a very good agreement was obtained for all but two samples demonstrating the applicability of the proposed method, which provides the possibility to not only analyze a wide range of concentrations but also identify the presence of potential contaminants such as methanol. In such case, and considering that the concentration of methanol is expected to be much lower than that of ethanol, a careful adjustment of the dilution factor and/or the separation conditions (Tůma & Opekar, 2015) would need to be implemented to avoid peak overlaps."
12,Conclusions,"This report describes a fast, simple and clean analytical method for monitoring the ethanol content in different alcoholic beverages – from beers and wines to spirits – based on the photochemical oxidation of ethanol by using UV-LED/H2O2 system as a derivatization step preceding CE-UV with indirect detection. The conversion of primary alcohols to the corresponding carboxylic acid is carried out by irradiating the samples with a 10 W UV-LED during 15 min in the presence of 2% H2O2 and 10 mmol L−1 HCl and renders a reproducible efficiency of about 17% in the formation of acetic acid. The chosen background electrolyte composed of 30 mmol L−1 histidine, 15 mmol L−1 benzoic acid and 0.2 mmol L−1 CTAB allowed baseline peak separation of acetate from formate (and other relevant compounds) in less of 3 min and with RSD better than 5.5%. The linear range extended from 0.1 to 2.0 mmol L−1 and the limit of detection expressed in terms of ethanol was 50 µmol L−1. The method was successfully applied to the analysis of ethanol content in a set of twelve alcoholic beverages ranging from beer (5% v/v) to whiskey (53% v/v)."
