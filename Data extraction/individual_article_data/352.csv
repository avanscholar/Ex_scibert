0,Introduction,"The systematic and extreme diminution of the conventional fossil fuels in the last two decades led to the incessant depletion of restricted resources of renewable energies around the globe. Additionally, oscillation in price and their serious environmental impacts had driven the interest of researchers in the field of alternate renewable energy [1]. Among the various types of renewable biofuels like bioethanol, biobutanol, biogas and bio-oil; biohydrogen has received the most attention as a promising alternative energy source due to its advantages over the other. Biohydrogen is known for carbon-neutral, easy and eco-efficient productivity, zero greenhouse gas emission, and high energy content among all exiting fuels. During the conversion of energy hydrogen yields pollution-free byproducts in the form of water vapor. Hydrogen is also called as, “clean energy choice” due to its wide application in automobiles, central electricity and thermal energy production [2]. Hydrogen can be used as fuel for fuel cells or fuel for an internal combustion engine. In the last 5 years, the quality and sale of hydrogen becomes stringent and increased by 6% annually and are likely to enter into the gasoline market. The utilization of hydrogen energy will help to reduce the emission involved with environmental impacts significantly."
1,Current status of hydrogen production,"At present more than 90% of hydrogen in the market is provided by steam reforming of methane [3,4]. Hydrogen vehicles are opened for public transport in many countries like China, Korea, and Japan. According to The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), India has a massive demand for hydrogen, and the consumption will rise to 10 folds by 2050. The market value of hydrogen is $50 million in 2017 and expected to grow by 7% annually and reach $81 million in 2025. It is one of the essential industrial chemicals and majorly used in refineries for refining crude oil. India joined in International Partnership for Hydrogen economy in 2003 to establish the industrial use of hydrogen, which presently, produces 500 billion units of hydrogen fuel to supplement the automotive use of petrol and diesel. The chemistry of hydrogen is very different, and it promotes various chemical interactions and bond-forming compounds with other elements in the periodic table. For the real sustainable production and wide spread utilization of hydrogen has many technical problems in usage, storage and conversion which has to be addressed honestly. Hydrogen can be produced from organic material either by the biological fermentation or thermochemical method process [5]. Microbial methods of hydrogen production can be grouped into two categories based on the source of energy as light-dependent and light-independent processes. Light-dependent pathways comprise direct photolysis, indirect photolysis, whereas dark fermentation is exemplified by the light-independent process. In the thermochemical method, hydrogen is produced either by gasification or pyrolysis method. Usually, the biological hydrogen production rate and yields are lower and are unable to compete with fossil hydrogen. Undoubtedly, utilizing the waste feedstock material will reduce the production cost of hydrogen and besides reduces a load of environmental pollutants. Currently, the major application of hydrogen is fossil fuel processing and methanol production. The researchers are keen to figure out the various technologies to continually produce and store biohydrogen at low cost with commercially feasible and multivariate integrated bioprocesses for energy-saving disbursement, reuse of energy-rich industrial waste. The schematic representation of hydrogen production from the various biomass material is depicted in Fig. 1 ."
2,Hydrogen production process,Energy security and global climate change are the crucial drivers behind the clean biohydrogen energy generation. The major challenges for the biohydrogen production process are as follows. • Feedstock for hydrogen production • Types of pretreatment of feedstocks • Factor influencing hydrogen production • Hydrogen production method • Separation and purification process
3,Feedstock for hydrogen production,"3.1 Feedstock for hydrogen production Biomassis a sustainable feedstock for biohydrogen production is considered as the important energy source derived from various renewable organic materials. The feedstock should be natural and non-fossil material, abundant, renewable, and does not compete with food crops [6]. The wide availability of waste biomass and feedstock includes agricultural waste, energy crops, food waste, municipal waste, industrial waste, etc. The energy sources are converted into hydrogen energy after a sequence of reactions. The Department of Energy in the U.S. aims to substitute 20% of fossil fuel with green energy in 2030 and similarly, China has already clean energy initiative projects by using biomass feedstocks. The various type of potential feedstocks for hydrogen production are discussed below. 3.1.1 Food waste With the rapid development of the economy and modern society, wastage of food products is augmented annually in the emerging areas in Asia. About 1.3 billion tons of food waste are generated annually over the world and in particular, China alone produces 140 million tons of food waste and increasing 10% every year [3,4]. Food waste generally composed of raw and cooked food discarded either before or after food preparation and typically contains a significant volume of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, nitrogen and inorganic salts, etc. The composition of the food waste varies depending on the cultural habits and region and chiefly comprises of organic content (15–30%), water content (75–85%), salt content (up to 1.5%). The utilization of food waste for the large-scale production of hydrogen enjoys numerous benefits like energy production, waste reduction, elimination of the toxic gas emission and groundwater contamination. The researchers have focused their attention on food waste food processing waste as a sustainably renewable source for industrial hydrogen production from an anaerobic digestion process or through the gasification process [7]. Simple sugars like glucose, sucrose, xylose, or hexoses are produced during the hydrolysis of carbohydrates. Rice, wheat and potato slurry constitute a high source of carbohydrate. Oil and dairy products constitute the sources of lipids and on hydrolysis yields free fatty acid and glycerol. Cellulose and lignocelluloses are the utmost profuse biopolymers from fruits and vegetables that comprise a variety of sugars that can be used as a substrate for biohydrogen production. However, the biochemical composition of all these waste comprises a various concentration of carbohydrate, fat, protein cellulose and hemicellulose content. These various concentrations of the substrate itself become a limiting factor for hydrogen production due to the hydrolysis rate. Cheese whey waste contains a rich source of lactose (carbohydrates) along with other organic acids as a suitable substrate for hydrogen production by the clostridium species. The organic fraction of municipal solid waste includes a kitchen and municipal waste. This waste can also be managed as a feedstock for the production of hydrogen as they contain protein, fat, and a little number of carbohydrates. The carbohydrate-rich high solid organic waste could produce 20 times more hydrogen when compared with fat-rich high solid organic waste. 3.1.2 Industrial waste The industrial effluents pollute the environment and the ecosystem drastically over the past three decades. Extensive studies are made on the various industrial waste as a substrate for biohydrogen production and obtained an optimistic note on hydrogen production and commendable reduction in pollution. Hydrogen combustion provides high energy and in one hand generates water as its byproduct and on another hand treatment of wastewater is done. The various waste includes ethanol-producing industries, dairy waste, beverage wastewater, distillery waste, pharmaceutical waste and biodiesel industry. Molasses after fermentation into alcohol, the left out reside effluent is called vinasses. All alcohol-producing industries produce vinasses after distillation and have a high potential in hydrogen production due to their high sugar content. It is assumed that around 650 billion liters production annually and also reported that for every 1 ​L of ethanol production 10 ​L of vinasses are produced [8]. Vinasses are usually dark brown, high organic content with BOD and COD of 10–60 g/L and 50 g/L respectively. Abundantly available classes and vinasses are extensively demonstrated for hydrogen production. Vinasses offers a promising fermentative substrate for the industrial production of biohydrogen and reported the maximum yield of 131 mmol hydrogen per mol substrate consumed [9]. Vinasses are capable of producing hydrogen with high energy potential (140kJ/g COD) when compared with various wastewater. When the vinasses are coupled with the bio-methanation process along with the hydrogen production high level of COD reduction is possible. COD removal is crucial before the final disposal of the effluent. Crude glycerol is produced as a byproduct from the biodiesel industries in enormous quantities. The energy content of the crude glycerol is found to be high due to the presence of impurities like methanol and few traces of biodiesel. The energy content acts as a good carbon source for hydrogen production by many organisms likeE. aerogenes, Thermotoganeapolitana, Rhodopseudomonas palustris, and Klebsiella sp. [10]. [11]; reported that using crude glycerol as substrate by Thermotoganeapolitana DSM 4359 yields 0.14 ​mol of hydrogen produced per each mole of glycerol used. The oxidative metabolism of crude glycerol by different organisms produces different organic compounds as intermediate and also yields hydrogen. Other industrial wastes like dairy industries, palm oil waste, food industries, textile wastewater and petrochemical industries are also reported as a potential substrate for hydrogen production. Palm oil is the major cash crop in many developing countries and during the extraction of palm oil, the liquid effluent generated is known as palm oil mill effluent (POME). The POME is a highly viscous liquid with pH 4 and contains 95% water, 0.6–0.7% oil, 4–5% total solids with high BOD (25,000 mg/L) and COD (50,000 mg/L). POME sludge was initially used as a seed culture for biohydrogen production and therefore initiated the usage of POME sludge for the enhanced biohydrogen production in thermophilic conditions. The organic-rich palm oil mill effluents are used for hydrogen production by Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum microbe at the thermophilic condition. Wastewater from the cheese and dairy industry is rich in lactose which can be consumed as an organic substrate for the production of biohydrogen. The protein, lipids and other complex organic polysaccharides are typical dairy waste along with water soluble-vitamin and mineral salt that yields sugar, amino acids and fatty on hydrolysis. Several studies carefully assessed the hydrogen production from cheese whey and dairy wastewater, coupled with wastewater treatment. The wastewater generated from the petrochemical industries contains a huge amount of organic and inorganic compounds with fewer toxic substances. Ethylene glycol present in the waste serves as the organic compound for the anaerobic production of hydrogen. The textile industries consume a huge amount of water for the process like bleaching, scouring washing, and dyeing. The wastewater contains a dye, starch surfactant and other chemicals. Carbohydrates and other organic compounds turn the textile wastewater as an effective feedstock the hydrogen production [12]. 3.1.3 Other renewable sources Fresh algal feedstocks are produced around 150–600 tons per hectare annually represents an excellent opportunity for the industrial production of hydrogen [13]. Chlorella sp. and Saccharina sp. are used as an effective feedstock for hydrogen production coupled with biodiesel production. Protein, carbohydrates, and lipids are found to be the basic biochemical components of algae. Hydrogen can be produced either by photofermentation or dark fermentation process. Hydrogen is produced aerobically in the photofermentation process by deriving the energy from sunlight whereas, in dark reaction, certain species of algae produce hydrogen anaerobically by utilizing the organic compounds as an energy source [14]. Compared to other traditional methods of hydrogen production, algal biomass gasification seems to be more effective in resource utilization. Around, 11.4 billion of biomass are produced annually from global form land and forest [15]. Extensive studies are carried out on lignocellulosic biomass comprises of agricultural residues like straws, stalks, forest residues, yard clippings, grass, wood chips,etc. for the utilization/valorization of waste for biohydrogen production. Hexoses and pentose sugars are largely available in the lignocellulose materials. The biohydrogen production is limited by the complex matrix of cellulose which ultimately resulted in various types of pretreatment processes to degrade the cellulose into simple sugars."
4,Types of pretreatment of feedstock,"3.2 Types of pretreatment of feedstock One way or another all the raw feedstocks need a pretreatment process for effective hydrogen production. The cellulose content of the lignocellulosic materials is not readily utilized for hydrogen production due to its rigid crystalline structure and undergoes either physical, chemical or biological pretreatment [16]. Similarly, organic waste and wastewater resources from food waste and industrial waste are not directly used. To overcome these problems there are many methods of pretreatment of feedstocks are available. These sequences of a pretreatment process result in a higher proportion of readily available feedstocks for the fermentation process by microorganisms for hydrogen production. Sometimes a combination of pretreatment is employed based on the feedstock to attain superior results related to single pretreatment methods. The merits and demerits of various pretreatment methods as represented in Table 1 . 3.2.1 Physical pretreatment Physical pretreatment comprises the physical forces to treat the feedstocks without the action of enzymes and chemicals. Thermal, microwave, freeze and thaw and ionizing radiation are the physical methods available for the pretreatment of feedstocks. 3.2.1.1 Thermal treatment Thermal treatment is the most commonly used method in solubilizing/hydrolyzing the biomass of organic compounds for hydrogen production. Thermal pretreatment decomposes the complex substrate into a simpler substrate by biomass liquefaction and augments the anaerobic digestion process. In high temperatures, thermal denaturation occurs due to the disruption of chemical bonds of the cell wall and the membrane [17]. The higher temperature not only enhances the hydrogen production but it also deactivates counterproductive non-hydrogen producing microbes. Temperature adopted for putrefying biomass varies depending on the substrates since few substrates are thermally liable. The most widely used temperature is 121 ​°C for 20–30 minutes however, for the waste activated sludge the temperature ranges from 100 ​°C to 175 ​°C and duration time about 15–60 min for the hydrogen production. Cellulose-based compounds the temperature varies on a large scale from 50 to 220 ​°C and time duration from 20 minutes to 24 hours. Since thermal pretreatment is always carried out in combination with other methods for the cellulose-based feedstocks. In combination with chemical hydrolysis, lignocellulose feedstocks release toxic compounds like furfural, carbonic acid and phenolic compounds when the thermal treatment carried above 110 ​°C. The toxic compounds may be removed via precipitation with calcium chloride or adsorption with activated carbon. 3.2.1.2 Autoclaving Autoclaving is the common sterilization technique followed in laboratories for many years. This technique employs a steam sterilization process to lyse the microbial cell or rupture microalgal cells at 121 ​°C at 15 psi pressure [18]. Autoclaving is carried out at different temperatures and times based on the needs to reduce energy consumption. The other added advantage of autoclaving is preserving the nutrients present in the waste without the addition of any chemicals and eliminates the unwanted microbes present in the feedstocks. Currently, thermal treatment by autoclaving is carried out for treating municipal and food wastes. In this method, food waste is broken down into fiber-like material which in turn enhances the production of hydrogen or can be reclaimed as an organic fertilizer. Several studies have witnessed that sterilization of microalgae Scenedes musobliquus biomass before fermentation yields more hydrogen. The methanol, an inhibitory agent present in crude glycerol, can be substantially removed by autoclaving at 121 ​°C in 15 minutes before fermentative hydrogen production. 3.2.1.3 Microwave Microwaves are electromagnetic waves which provide high disruption efficiency in a short time on a microorganism with frequency ranges from 0.3 GHz to 300 GHz.Microwave irradiation generates the heat energy which led to cell disruption in the solution by interacting with dielectric and polar molecules. The continuous effect on the alignment and realignment of polar molecules rupture hydrogen bonds [19]. A microwave heating provides uniform heating over the feedstock when compared with the conventional heating method [20]. revealed that the solubilizing of sludge was three times more in microwave treatment when compared with the heat treatment at the same temperature. A 2450 MHz of a wavelength is generally applied to the extraction of lipids from the microalgal cell. 3.2.1.4 Freezing and thawing pretreatment Freezing and thawing are applied to treating waste activated sludge and microalgal biomass. The freeze-drying enhances the cell swelling by large ice crystal resulting in cell disruption and the intracellular components are released through a shattered cell during thawing at room temperature. [21]; observed that freezing and thawing of wastewater sludge could enhance 40% hydrogen yield but no significant improvement in the sludge solubilization. High energy demand and heavy operation, restrict use in industrial application and literature support of hydrogen production via microalgal are very rare in laboratory-scale experiments itself [22]. 3.2.2 Chemical treatment Chemical pretreatments are usually preferred for easy scale-up and their low energy demand. Many organic and inorganic solvents are employed in the cell disruption and extraction of pigments from algae and hydrolysis of lignocellulosic components from food waste. But in this session is restricted to acid and alkaline treatment because of easy operative and does not require modern equipment when compared with the addition of oxidizing agent. 3.2.2.1 Acid/alkali pretreatment In acid/alkaline pretreatment cell wall destruction and carbohydrate hydrolysis of feedstock is employed concurrently by integrating the liquefaction and saccharification process in a single step. Sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrogen peroxide and phosphoric acid are used in acid pretreatment and whereas in alkali pretreatment sodium or potassium hydroxide and aqueous ammonia are commonly employed. Acid hydrolysis breaks the polymer molecule while; the base saponifies the ester bonds of cell wall lipids contributing to cellular matrix disintegration and cellular crystallinity destruction [23]. revealed in his studies that the maximum production of hydrogen was obtained in 6 hours when the activated sludge was treated with 0.5% (w/v) HCl [24]. stated that 3 and 2.6 folds of hydrogen production increased in treating the food waste at pH 2 and 12 respectively when compared with control. Similarly few studies reported that alkaline pretreatment at pH12 yields 82.4% hydrogen from waste activated sludge. The lignocellulose materials undergo the decomposition of cellulose and hemicellulose for the ready utilization of microbes by a fermentation process. The strong acid completely dissolves cellulose and lignin in rice straw at 40 ​°C and gradually improves the hydrogen production whereas in dilute acid (2% concentration) the lignin remains without degradation. The acid treatment effectively solubilizes 80% of cellulose at a reasonable cost. The crystalline and unstructured structure of cellulose is weakened and modified by alkali treatment and improves the thermodynamic stability of lignocellulose material. Alkali treatment combined with the enzyme or ultrasound may enhance the anaerobic digestion of sugarcane the biohydrogen production by increasing the cellulose and hemicellulose surface area and removes lignin. Acid and alkali treatment is usually carried out at room temperature and needs long residence time when they are used alone. For easy and to get high efficiency usually acid/alkali treatment is carried out along with thermal treatment. The pretreated feedstocks are desired to undergo the neutralizing process for the pH adjustment before the fermentation process which is either economically or environmentally safe. Apart, from acid/alkali treatment oxidizing agents are used for pretreatment of feedstocks. The strong oxidizing ability of ozone gas is used in solubilizing the feedstock through the ozonolysis process. In applying ozone to the wheat straw, the hydrogen production is improved by 158% by decreasing the inhibitor present in the feed. The nascent oxygen generated from H2O2 can break the glycosidic bonds of carbohydrates into simple sugars. This drawback of ozonolysis is that it requires a large volume of ozone and a very expensive process [25]. 3.2.3 Biological pretreatment Biological pretreatment commonly employed in treating the cellulose-based feedstocks and algal biomass and does not require high temperature and chemicals. However, the biological pretreatment usually carried out after the physical or chemical pretreatment. The biological method is pretreatment requires high retention time which ultimately results in time-consuming process and the microorganism/enzymes readily utilize the carbohydrates during the pretreatment process. 3.2.3.1 Enzymatic pretreatment Enzymes are specific in action, and it is termed as biocatalyst. The feedstocks are converted into suitable raw material after various physical or chemical pretreatment and require the enzymatic pretreatment process as a stable process for hydrogen production. The lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose components present on food waste and other lignocellulose based feedstocks are usually degraded by laccases, xylanases and cellulose enzymes respectively. The toxin derivative of lignin present in the feedstock inhibits the hydrolysis of feedstock and hence the extraction of lignin with the aid of chemicals leads to biomass swelling. The biomass swelling alters the lignin structure and allows the cellulolytic enzyme to degrade the lignin. These enzymes act on the feedstock and convert them into five or six carbon atoms like glucose, xylose, arabinose, or mannose. The microorganism could utilize these five and six carbon and produces biohydrogen via a fermentation process. For the pretreatment process, either pure form of enzyme or microbes which secretes enzymes is used during the fermentation process. However, continuing suitable circumstances for the effective hydrolysis of waste in much important in the enzymatic pretreatment process. The polyphenols, melanoid in and heavy metals present in the molasses wastewater may cause the microbial inhibition andthe biodegradability is improved by enzyme treatment [26]. reported that hydrolyzing rice straw using cellulose enzyme produces 54.18g/L sugar and 2.58LH2/L of the hydrogen production. 3.2.4 Mechanical pretreatment process The ultimate goal of the mechanical pretreatment method is to increase the surface area and reduce the crystallinity, which is achieved by various processes like milling, grinding and chipping. The mechanical method of pretreatment is always assisted with either with physical, chemical or biological methods for the effective utilization of a substrate. 3.2.4.1 Ultrasonication In the ultrasonication process, ultrasonic waves are introduced for the cell disruption and particle solubilization in the frequencies ranges of 10 kHz–20 kHz. The electrical energy transformed into physical energy resulting in the formation of the bubble and cavitation in the waste due to the generation of pressure. The cavitation releases enormous energy with powerful vibration results in the formation of high localized temperature and shear forces that breaks the cell walls. The ultrasonic waves damage the cellular components at higher frequencies by the generation of free radicals [22]. Ultrasonication usually applied to solubilizing activated sludge in food waste industries and bacterial and algal cell lysis for the protein, lipid extraction with the use of an ice bath. The application of ultrasound to lignocellulose feed stock disintegrates a lignocellulosic structure by splitting the hydrogen bond present in and thereby reducing the hydrogen production fermentation time [21]. reported in their studies using ultrasonication they could enhance the COD solubilization by 5% in waste activated sludge and hydrogen yield by 60% [27]. employed ultrasonication pretreatment in distillery wastewater and used RSM methodology which resulted in increased hydrogen production of 1.4 fold. ScenedesmusobliquusYSW15 produces hydrogen of 2.5mL/L in the dark fermentation process after pretreatment by Ultrasonication (40 kHz, 2.2 kW) for 15 min. Similarly, many studies reported that high frequencies of ultrasonic waves are very effective in algal cell disruption and enhance hydrogen production by 25%. The cell disruption by ultrasonic waves is highly dependent on size, shape, age of the culture and cell suspension density apart from process parameters."
5,Factor influencing hydrogen production,"3.3 Factor influencing hydrogen production Hydrogen production from organic waste reduces waste minimization and concurrent energy generation. At present nearly 1% renewable energy feedstock/biomass is utilized for hydrogen production. However, various parameters like microbial culture, nutrient composition, temperature, pH, Hydraulic retention time (HRT), Organic Loading Rate (OLR), reactor model and operation influences the scale-up factors of hydrogen production after the substrate pretreatment. Hence, various studies in the last few years have witnessed the importance of understanding the various factors affecting large scale biohydrogen production. 3.3.1 Microbial culture Microbes play a dynamic role in the fermentative production of hydrogen. Among the various types of microorganism Clostridium and Enterobacter are widely used as inoculum and their yield of hydrogen are promising [3,4]. Apart from these, a diverse group of organisms includes aerobic strain, pure and mixed strain and mesophilic and thermophilic strains are used for the dark fermentation process. In thermophilic conditions, the competitive growth of another organism is reduced and thermophilic strains result in higher substrate efficiency. However, the mesophilic strains have the potential of higher productivity of hydrogen. The Clostridium strains report hydrogen production of 0.84mol H2/mol hexose consumed through dark fermentation. The pure culture is always highly selective and the growth of the organism and the operational conditions can be easily monitored. However, from an engineering perspective, the fermentative hydrogen production is carried out in the mixed culture from anaerobic sludge; municipal sewage sludge is used as inoculum. The major hindrance in scaling up the hydrogen production results in low yield caused by contamination. The food and other organic waste are subjected to pretreatment before fermentation to remove hydrogen consuming bacteria and enhance hydrogen yield. Apart from bacterial species microalgae like Chloropyta, Rhodophyta and Bacillariophta can be cultivated in any form of water and could tolerate a wide environmental condition for hydrogen production. The productivity and the age of the inoculum play a vital role in hydrogen production. 3.3.2 pH pHis a crucial and important parameter in hydrogen production. The cell structure, metabolic pathway, microbial growth and yields are powerfully concomitant with the pH. Since any change in the desired pH value would eventually affect the growth and metabolic production of hydrogen [28]. Initial pH found to influence the hydrogen yield and scale-up process. Many studies have revealed that the optimum pH of 5.2–6 yields maximum hydrogen through the fermentation process by using pure or consortia culture. However, it is important to know that hydrogen production was not reported at a pH of less than 4 and greater than 8. Lower pH affects the hydrogenase enzyme activity and inhibits the hydrogen producer and at extreme pH condition,a methanogenic organism is eliminated [11]. [29] reported the maximum biohydrogen production is achieved with the initial pH 7 when compared with controlled pH of 5.5 throughout the study. The pH of the system has to be monitored to maintain the activity of hydrogen-producing bacteria. The usage of buffers like sodium or potassium hydroxide or calcium carbonate or few livestock manures may enhance the buffering capacity and maintain the pH for better biohydrogen production. Hydrogen yield was found to increase by 0.9 mol H2/mol hexose in scaling up of the system to 150 L reactor using alkali pretreated (pH 12) food waste at controlled temperature and C/N ratio. 3.3.3 Temperature Temperature is a vital variable parameter in hydrogen production which affects the substrate degradation, microbial growth and metabolic activity. The different temperature ranges for the anaerobic fermentation process for the hydrogen production process are mesophilic, thermophilic and hyperthermophilic. Mesophilic temperature of 30–49 ​°C is ambient for hydrogen production and also favors the process in terms of expenses and other technical features. However, the biohydrogen production performance and substrate degradation can be effectively attained at a higher temperature and also limits the activity of propionic acid and methane producer. Depending upon the substrate and organism, the temperature is properly maintained for the hydrogen production. Whenever the mesophiles lack the propensity to act on a cellulose substrate for hydrogen production thermophiles can be used for its high hydrolysis rate [30]. stated that biohydrogen yields 0.78 mol H2/mol of cheese whey consumed in mesophilic conditions, whereas 1.03 mol H2/mol of glucose consumed at the thermophilic condition. In general, high temperature promotes hydrogen production by increasing the system entropy and results in high-energy investment and operation maintenance. 3.3.4 Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) Hydraulic retention time (HRT) or fermentation describes the meantime, during which a substrate remains reactor system before discharge and significantly influences hydrogen production by restricting the methanogenic activity. Reaction velocity, active biomass concentration and composition are the several factors that influence the HRT. In dark fermentation processes, the ideal HRT for the hydrogenation process usually takes a few hours to one day. The optimum HRT is maintained between 8 and 14 hours for hydrogen production. The dairy and chemical wastewater are used as a substrate for acidogenic activity hydrogen can be produced within 0–14 hours whereas mixed culture, constantly yields hydrogen after 3 days. The increase in the specific growth rate of the organism leads to shorter HRT. The HRT is measured by the dilution rate in a CSTR and optimum HRT can be resolved on the bioprocess used. The increase in flow rate results in cell washout which in turn decreases the HRT and hydrogen productivity. Biohydrogen producing organism prefers short HRT. In the scale-up process, exceeding the suitable length of HRT will lead to a decrease in hydrogen yields because of hydrogen consuming bacteria and volatile fatty acid formation. Variation in HRT could change the loading rate of nutrients, substrate utilization efficiency and yield of biohydrogen [31]. 3.3.5 Organic Loading Rate (OLR) The quantity of the organic substrate fed into the reactor per unit volume for bio-digestion in a given unit period time is known as Organic Loading Rate (OLR). The OLR has a notable impact on biohydrogen production. The transformation of carbohydrate in organic material is inversely proportionate to OLR in the reactor, which means the overloading of organic materials may affect the reactor performance. The high OLR reduces the hydrogen yield due to the overloading of organic substrate vice versa the highest hydrogen yield achieved at a lower feed rate of organic substrates [30]. The optimal OLR of a reactor depends on the various aspects which include pH, temperature, substrate concentration and the reactor type. An optimum OLR of 38.4 g COD/L in 24 hours with facultative anaerobic bacteria shows a maximum hydrogen production by utilizing the citric acid wastewater. By optimizing HRT and OLR in the continuous system will enhance the hydrogen production and is known as the threshold [32]. 3.3.6 Bioreactor configurations Bioreactor design and processes are the key parameters that affects biohydrogen in the micro-environment [33]. Batch reactors are widely used studies while in the commercial-scale Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) has been widely used for hydrogen production from industrial wastewater. The demerits like low hydrogen production from batch reactor paved the way for the development of CSTR. The height-width ratio, impeller diameter, speed of agitation and baffle arrangements plays a crucial role in CSTR design. The CSTR are widely used for continuous hydrogen production by providing the perfect mass transfer between the substrate and microorganism. Due to the mixing pattern, the CSTR is unable to hold large quantity of microorganism for fermentation and thus results in substantial biomass washout. Immobilization technique helps to retain the biomass within the CSTR to increase the biohydrogen yield and to avoid the biomass washout. The HRT, and in turn with OLR had a great impact on substrate conversion efficiency, metabolic pathway and hydrogen production. The short HRT at low pH level is used to clean out the hydrogen consuming bacteria and to increase the hydrogen production. There are various types of CSTR like upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor, anaerobic fluidized bed reactor membrane bioreactors and packed bed reactor are available. These bioreactors influence the microenvironment of the reactor, hydrodynamic behaviour, wastewater-biocatalyst contact, microbial population survival and contact with the substrate. 3.3.7 Other parameters The continuous production of hydrogen can overcome the limitation of batch reaction like reducing the length of lag phase, shutdown period and cleaning of instruments. The availability of nutrients like carbon, nitrogen, vitamins, phosphates and trace elements are essential to maintain the optimum microbial growth. Peptone a nitrogen source from corn starch waste enhances hydrogen production. For the stabilization of the fermentation reaction, maintaining an optimum C/N is important. The optimal range of C/N ratio 13 to 25 was reported. Extreme ratios could develop a negative effect on biohydrogen production [34]. The volatile fatty acids like acetic acid, lactic acid and propionic acids are formed as intermediate byproducts during hydrogen production anaerobically. In contrast, no hydrogen production occurs if lactic acid and propionic acid are produced as intermediates. A series of substrate pretreatment steps are followed to prevent the influence of lactic acid bacteria and other hydrogen consuming bacteria during the fermentation of hydrogen production. Apart from these, there are few more factors that also influence hydrogen production like dilution rate, critical factor, hydrogen partial pressure and composition of nutrients."
6,Hydrogen production methods,"3.4 Hydrogen production methods At present, around 90% of the hydrogen production, constitutes from fossil fuels and its utilization reduces the fossil resources. Around 53% of the hydrogen produced is used for the synthesis of ammonia and butanediol. Besides, biohydrogen also serves as a primary substrate for technologies like hydrocracking, synthetic gas generation and methanol synthesis. Production of hydrogen from renewable energy sources includes biofuels, sewage sludge, agri-food, and industrial waste through the metabolic process of a microorganism [35]. Hydrogen is produced by the biological and thermochemical processes. Hydrogen produced from the biological process is called biohydrogen and is mainly classified as a light-dependent and dark fermentation process in which the organic substrates are converted into hydrogen. The light-dependent fermentation process i) direct photolysis, ii) indirect photolysis, iii) photo fermentation and the dark fermentation processes are called light-independent processes. 3.4.1 Direct photolysis Direct photosynthesis produces hydrogen by using photosynthetic organisms like cyanobacteria and algae. These organisms utilize solar energy by the photosynthesis process to split water into oxygen and hydrogen. Algae have established their capability to unleash protons and electrons in the progression of splitting water using solar energy. Photolysis utilizes water as a substrate and produces hydrogen and carbon dioxide as the product. Subsequently, electrons are shifted to hydrogenases and/or nitrogenases. Hydrogenases enzyme under anaerobic condition converts the hydrogen ion into hydrogen gas. However, low yield and inhibition of oxygen by hydrogenases enzyme restrict the process. Oxygen ion is used by the organism for its respiration. Normally, hydrogen production by these algae under anaerobic conditions requires several minutes to few hours to induce hydrogenases enzyme. The process produces H2 and O2 at a 2:1 ratio simultaneous as represented in equation (1) [36]. documented that sulfur-deficient green algae could induce hydrogenase reaction to produce hydrogen photosynthetically under anaerobic conditions. Low light conversion efficiencies, oxygen-sensitive hydrogenases are the few challenges to be addressed. (1) 2H2O ​+ ​light energy →2H2+ O2 3.4.2 Indirect photolysis Indirect photolysis is also a light-driven process that entails the use of photosynthetic bacteria which occurs by two steps and mediated by a few pigments [37]. A blue-green algae (Cyanobacteria) photoautotrophic organism can synthesize and evolve hydrogen through this process. The Cyanobacteria may be either nitrogen-fixer or non-nitrogen fixer. The nitrogen-fixing bacteria primarily utilizes the nitrogenase enzyme for hydrogen production whereas the non-nitrogen fixing bacteria uses bidirectional hydrogenase enzyme for hydrogen production. In the first step, large number of carbohydrates are produced through photosynthetic processes. In the second step, stored carbohydrate is used as a substrate for the hydrogen production as shown in equation 2and 3 [38]. (2) 6H2O + 6 CO2 + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2 (3) C6H12O6 ​+ ​2H2O → 4H2 ​+ ​2CH3COOH ​+ ​2CO2 To prevent oxygen inhibition by hydrogenase enzyme in indirect photolysis during photosynthesis, the evolution of hydrogen and oxygen are temporally or partially separated at various stages. 3.4.3 Photofermentation In photofermentation, in the presence of sunlight, the anaerobic bacteria (purple non-sulfur bacteria) metabolize the volatile organic acid for the production of hydrogen gas. The volatile acids are used as a substrate by the microbes and release hydrogen as a byproduct as shown in equation (4). The simple purple non-sulfur bacteria has only photosystem I, which is not so powerful to split the water as in photolysis. Therefore, these bacteria use external organic compounds or even dihydrogen sulfide as an electron donor under anaerobic conditions in the presence of sunlight and produce hydrogen gas. (4) CH3COOH + 2H2O ​+ ​light energy → 4H2+ 2CO2 ΔGo + 104 KJ The fermentation of acetic acid could release 4 ​mol of hydrogen through photosynthetic process. The Gibbs positive energy indicates an external source of energy is necessary for the process to continue. The hydrogen production by photofermentation is highly dependent on light energy. The photo fermentation bacteria can utilize a wide variety of organic substrates like industrial and agricultural waste [39]. The non-sulfur bacteria also have the ability to liberate 100% electron from the organic compounds and generate hydrogen and carbon dioxide with few byproducts via the photo fermentation process. 3.4.4 Dark fermentation In dark fermentation, the obligate or facultative anaerobic microorganism utilizes various organic substrates to produce hydrogen at higher rates when compared to other fermentation processes. During anaerobic fermentation, the organic substrates are broken down into simpler elements and produce hydrogen along with lactic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, fertilizer and ethanol as a high-value intermediates chemicals [40]. Pyruvate is the key anaerobic metabolite formed during the production of hydrogen from glucose. The pyruvate used to produce acetyl CoA by anyone of the enzymes namely formatelyase or ferredoxinoxidoreductase. Based on the fermentation process and microbes used either acetic acid or butyric acid is produced as metabolites along with hydrogen gas. When compared to all metabolites acetic acid pathways yields 4 mol hydrogen and whereas the butyric acid generates only 2 ​mol of hydrogen as shown in equations (5) and (6) below. (5) C6H12O6 + 2H2O → 4H2 + 2CH3COOH + 2CO2 ΔGo-48 KJ (6) C6H12O6 ​+ ​2H2O → 2H2 ​+ ​2CH3CH2COOH ​+ ​2CO2 ΔGo-137 KJ The Gibbs’s negative energy implies that energy is released during the process and further can proceed without an additional energy source. Fig. 2 represents the schematic pathway of biohydrogen production from biomass using various enzymes. Above all fermentation process dark, fermentation seems to be a more advantageous and attractive route for hydrogen production from renewable sources in the absence of light. 3.4.5 Thermochemical method Hydrogen production by treatment of biomass as substrate/feedstock either by biological machinery or through the thermochemical process is also termed as biohydrogen [41]. The bioconversion route of the thermochemical process consists of gasification and pyrolysis. Biomass gasification is considered as one of the economic and convenient methods of biohydrogen production [42]. Biomass gasification is one of the thermochemical methods operated at high temperature (600–1000 ​°C) by assessing a limited amount of air and oxygen. This process is applied to a wide variety of renewable biomass and carbon-based resources like agricultural residue, municipal waste and agro-industrial waste [6]. Biomass gasification to hydrogen production takes place either by steam gasification or supercritical water gasification. The combined biomass comprises of palm shell, fiber and empty fruit bunch e catalyzed and yielded 1.481 m3/kg of hydrogen gas at the temperature of about 750 ​°C–900 ​°C.Pyrolysis, another thermochemical method of hydrogen production from biomass takes place at elevated temperature (200–600 ​°C). Based on the heating process rate pyrolysis is classified into fast and slow pyrolysis. Hydrogen gas is produced along with other producer gas likeCO2, H2S, N2 and CH4. The efficiency of the thermochemical process depends on various parameters like type of catalyst, particle size, bed material, steam to biomass ratio, temperature and gasification time [43]. The efficiency and yield of hydrogen production in the industrial-scale are found to be more promising in the gasification method when compared with pyrolysis. However, the calorific value of the hydrogen gas is reduced if the water content is higher. Apart, from the above-mentioned process, the hydrogen can also be produced by microbial electrolysis cells (MECs). This is a remarkable method of hydrogen production by utilizing the organic degradable biomass and transfer the electron to the anode in the microbial fuel cell. This method comprises a double compartment where anode and cathode are separated by the membrane and the oxidation of organic matter releases a proton (H+) and electron (H-) when transferred through the membrane. The hydrogen gas is produced inside the cathode, where the proton and electron are chemically reduced in the presence of a catalyst."
7,Hydrogen separation and purification methods,"3.5 Hydrogen separation and purification methods The gas mixture obtained after the fermentation process is incompatible for direct use as it contains hydrogen along with CO2 and other trace gases. Therefore, hydrogen purification becomes mandatory for the industrial application process to withstand as renewable energy. In this process, the impure hydrogen gas is purified, compressed and stored densely to compete with the energy values of other gasses like gasoline and natural gas [44]. Cryogenic, Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA), membrane separation and electrochemical separation process are most commonly used in industries for hydrogen purification processes. 3.5.1 Cryogenic process The basic principle of the cryogenic separation process involves, cooling of gasses at low temperatures so that CO2is liquefied and separated. Cryogenic processes of hydrogen purification are expensive, requires numerous instruments and energy-intensive process as it is operated at very low temperature (−250 ​°C). This process relies on partial condensation of the gas mixture at high pressure and low temperature. The cryogenic process can be carried out either with distillation or without distillation process and the efficiency of the purification process lays between 95 and 98%. The cryogenic process is widely applicable for the larger production process and thus it is unsuitable for small portable units of hydrogen plants for purification and compression process. 3.5.2 Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) Pressurizing Swing Adsorption (PSA) is a conventional technique and most studied technology for hydrogen separation which depends on diverse adsorption capacity of absorber at high and low pressures. In this process, the gasses are selectively adsorbed at high pressure and desorbed at low pressure. The pressure swing between high-pressure feed and low-pressure tail gas. To improve the purity of the adsorbed hydrogen, the number of adsorption beds is increased in the range of 4–12. The multiple bed absorbers provide the constant flow rate of feed, product and tail gas [45]. PSA is a state of the art technology of pure hydrogen production in all petrochemical industries. The purity of hydrogen ranges from 99.5 to 99.9%.PSA can be used medium to large industries and as well as in pilot and small portable system. 3.5.3 Membrane separation process The membrane separation is the most common and widely used technique in the hydrogen separation/purification process. The driving force for hydrogen separation is applying the pressure gradient across the membrane. To initiate the gaseous through the hermetically sealed membrane, the high pressure gradient is created by maintaining high inlet pressure at one side and low pressure on the opposite side. Two important parameters that affect the separation process are permeability of the gas and selectivity [46]. The most standard classification of membranes for hydrogen separation is by its composition as follows a porous inorganic membrane and dense metallic membrane. Porous inorganic membranes with the pore diameter less than 2nm separate hydrogen from other light gases like CO2, CO, CH4, H2O along the particulates H2S. The separation process mainly relies on a molecular sieving mechanism to achieve hydrogen separation. Pores size and shape are the main elements in the porous inorganic membrane separation process and generally show greater H2/CO2 selectivity at a higher temperature. The other types of porous membranes are into zeolite membranes, silica membranes and carbon-based membranes. The dense metallic membrane or metal alloyed membrane has attracted the attention of researchers for the hydrogen separation process. The metal membranes are commonly prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical sputtering, or electroless plating. The Pd and Pd–Cu alloyed metallic membranes are most commonly used for their thermal resistivity. Selectivity towards hydrogen and long term stability. Many other types of membranes exist for the hydrogen purification process. The separation and purification process is essential for the sustainable development of the hydrogen production system."
8,Prospective and future research,"Hydrogen production from fossil fuels is predominately used for its applicable technologies and high efficiency. Regarding the hydrogen production process, low production rate, yield, facility, operational and material cost are the major challenges to be addressed for the feasible practical process. Production of hydrogen from organic renewable resources is needed to be studied more intensively. Dark fermentative hydrogen production from waste biomass produces cheap, abundant hydrogen and has dual benefits like environment cleaning and hydrogen production economically. Applying genetic and metabolic engineering to the microbes which could effectively hydrolysis and tolerance towards inhibitor present in the waste organic material. The integration of various pretreatment methods will improve the hydrolysis rate and fermentation process which results in better the hydrogen yields. For the continuous production of hydrogen from the feedstock, many investigations are on the pretreatment process from the laboratory level to the industrial scale. Apart from heat treatment, a combination of various treatments can be considered for the effective utilization of biomass/feedstock. Strong technical knowledge and technologies are needed to shift the hydrogen production process from laboratory scale to industrial scale. The design and operational procedures of the reactors are needed to be studied further, since, OLR, HRT, is the major influencing parameter in the hydrogen production process. The conversion of biomass into hydrogen by biological or thermochemical means are not entirely free from greenhouse gas emission in terms of CO2 equivalent emission. The CO2 equivalent emission varies with the feedstock and its conversion pathway. The other challenges which need to be addressed in biohydrogen production are hydrogen storage, transportation and distribution system should be strengthened for the wide use of high-energy hydrogen."
9,Conclusions,"The production of hydrogen biologically has advantages over the other method to meet the present-day energy demand and ensures energy security without increasing greenhouse gas. The hydrogen production from biomass depends on the type of feedstocks, process condition and process technology. Utilization of organic-rich waste from industrial, agricultural and food waste as a feedstock/substrate after proper pretreatment could effectively enhance the fermentative hydrogen production. More knowledge of the reaction and parameter influence will increase the production of hydrogen under a controlled environment. Furthermore, knowledge in the downstream processing will help to recover, separate and purify the hydrogen produced and stored for further uses. Coproducts production like methane and ethanol by biorefinery concept will give sustainable and economic development of bio-based hydrogen production."
