0,Introduction,"Atherosclerosis is a pathological process of chronic inflammatory changes that occur on the walls of the large and middle arteries caused by multiple factors. Previous studies have shown that intestinal H2S may have a systemic antihypertensive effect, and intestinal microbial endotoxemia can cause chronic inflammation, which is thought to be associated with atherosclerosis."
1,Hydrogen sulfide production and metabolism,"The synthesis of H2S in mammalian cells can be divided into two pathways, the enzymatic pathway, and the non-enzymatic pathway (Wang et al., 2017). H2S can also be released from intracellular sulfur storage (sulfane sulfide). Studies have found that five enzymes in mammals are involved in the regulation of endogenous H2S production, namely cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE), 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST), cysteine Aminotransferase (CAT) and D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) (Mani et al., 2014; Pan et al., 2012; Panthi et al., 2016). The non-enzymatic source of H2S is primarily inorganic polysulfides (Peers 2012) and this pathway allows H2S to be delivered through the dietary pathway (Benavides et al., 2007). The non-enzymatic synthesis pathway is the fermentation of sulfur-containing amino acids, sulfates and other precursors by sulfate-reducing bacteria to form H2S(Martin et al., 2010). There are a variety of bacterial phyla in the gut, including Fusobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia (Hermann-Bank et al., 2013), of which anaerobic Bacteroides and thick-walled bacteria account for 90% of the total bacterial species (Flint et al., 2012). H2S is one of the richest metabolites in the gut microbiota and the concentration of hydrogen sulfide produced by rodents and human intestinal flora is 0.2–3.4 mmoL/l (Blachier et al., 2010). Facultative anaerobic bacteria produce H2S by assimilation of sulfate or by the degradation of cysteine. However, the former renders a small yield and is quickly assimilated into organic sulfur compounds, while the latter has a large yield, which is the main production mode of H2S(Luhachack and Nudler 2014). Sulfate-reducing bacteria ferment substances such as sulfur-containing amino acids and sulfates to form H2S, but their physiological and/or pathological effects are still unclear. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are anaerobic microorganisms commonly found in the gut of humans and animals (Fite et al., 2004). More than 90% of the SRBs living in the human intestine belong to the genus Desulfovibrio, which is a Gram-negative bacterium. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the cell wall is one of the causes of chronic inflammation (Cani et al., 2007). The mechanism by which different bacteria degrade cysteine to produce H2S is different. Bacillus anthracis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus mainly rely on CBS and CSE to produce H2S, while Escherichia coli does not contain CBS and CSE, mainly relying on the synergistic action of CAT and 3-MST to produce H2S(Shatalin et al., 2011; Luhachack and Nudler 2014). In the intestinal tissue, H2S is cleared by methylation of thiocyanate producing enzyme (RHOD) and thiol S-methyltransferase (TSMT) to form methyl mercaptan and dimethyl sulfide (Furne et al., 2001). The microenvironmental stability of gut microbiota helps to protect the intestinal mucosal barrier, helps nutrient intake and regulates metabolism, assists in the maturation of immune tissues and prevents pathogenic microorganisms from entering the systemic circulation (Hamilton et al., 2015). Changes in the gut microbiota may damage the intestinal barrier, cause the flora to shift and the level of systemic inflammation to increase, thereby affecting the overall health of the body. The microbiota-derived molecules entry into the circulation is regulated by the gut-blood barrier (GBB). GBB is a complex multi-layered system that blocks the compounds from the free diffusion between the intestinal lumen and circulation. The transport of substances in GBB requires different routes depending on the physicochemical properties of the molecules. Small and lipophilic hydrophilic compounds are transported extracellularly, with larger hydrophilic compounds being transported extracellularly, while amino acids and vitamins are transported actively. The integrity and normal function of GBB depends on many factors that are not fully understood, including intestinal bacterial composition and adequate blood perfusion (Ufnal and Pham 2017; Farhadi et al., 2003). The easier entry of enterogenous molecules into the circulation may potentially affect the progress of the disease. Dysfunction of the intestinal mucosal barrier allows LPS to easily enter the bloodstream and function throughout the body, perpetuates mucosal inflammation, and leads to metabolic endotoxemia, which is found to be common in atherosclerosis (Morelli et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020). It has been reported that symbiotic bacteria enhances the completeness of GBB (Gaci et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015). The immune defense against pathogens is controlled by the gut-associated lymphoid tissue system, rather than the immune defense against symbiotic bacteria. One study showed that the total sulphide concentration in the large intestine of human, rat and mouse is in the range of 0.2–3.4 mmoL/l (Magee et al., 2000). The feces of rodents and humans have greater binding capacity. It was found that less than 8% of the total sulfides were in free form (Levitt et al., 2002; Jorgensen and Mortensen 2001). Mammalian tissue has a high ability to oxidize H2S, which occurs in the mitochondria (Hildebrandt and Grieshaber 2008). The oxidation products include persulfides, sulfites, thiosulfates, and sulfates. It has also been found that colonic epithelial cells convert sulphide to thiosulfate more efficiently than other tissues (Furne et al., 2001). Levitt et al. perfused intraperitoneally with radioactive H2S in rats, and then analysis of cecal venous blood revealed that all absorbed H2S was oxidized to thiosulfate (Levitt et al., 1999). Flannigan et al.(Flannigan et al., 2011) studied the ratio of bacterial to colonic H2S synthesis. As a result, it was found that sterile mouse fecal samples contained half of the H2S as compared with the control group. In addition, one study showed that the lack of vitamin B6, a CSE and CBS cofactor, in the diet resulted in a 50% reduction in H2S in the feces, possibly due to inhibition of H2S enzyme synthesis in colon tissue (Flannigan et al., 2011). After 6 weeks on a diet deficient in vitamin B6, the H2S levels in the feces recovered to the same level as the control group. This indicates that by increasing SRB activity, the production of H2S in the intestines of sterile mice is transferred to a non-enzymatic pathway (Flannigan et al., 2011). Studies have found that internal Na2S (H2S donor) increases the levels of sulfone sulfur and thiosulfate in portal blood, but this remarkable effect was not observed in peripheral blood. This suggests that the systemic effects of colon-derived H2S and its derivatives may be partly because of certain liver-dependent mechanisms (Tomasova et al., 2016)."
2,H2S and gut microbiota,"H2S can act as a signal molecule to initiate a free radical response and increase the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics. Shatalin et al.(Shatalin et al., 2011) found that after knocking out the genes for H2S-producing enzyme of B. anthracis, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and E. coli, or inhibiting the activity of CSE, CBS and MST with dl-pargyl glycine, aminoxyacetic acid and aspartic acid, these bacteria would become highly sensitive to antibiotics. This sensitivity can be reduced if the H2S concentration is increased by exogenous addition or endogenous. Exogenous hydrogen sulfide and endogenous sulfides generated by CBS have been shown to improve the integrity of the colon barrier (Zhao et al., 2016). Studies by Li et al. have shown that detoxification enzymes expressed in colon tissue are sufficient to protect the harmful effects of intestinal cell vulcanization (Figliuolo et al., 2017). In a mouse model of ligation and puncture-induced sepsis, gaseous sulfide reduces local (Wu et al., 2018) and systemic (Ferlito et al., 2014) inflammatory responses to collagen-induced arthritis. The protective role of sulfides in inflammatory processes may be due to their ability to modulate the activation and survival of macrophages and CD8+ T cells (Mirandola et al., 2007; Lohninger et al., 2015), as well as their contribution to regulatory T cells production (Yang et al., 2015). Endogenous H2S also attenuates NLRP3 inflammatory-mediated neuroinflammation via inhibiting P2X7 receptor 14 which is widely expressed in immune cells (Zhao et al., 2017)."
3,H2S and atherosclerosis,"Atherosclerosis is a chronic progressive pathological process of arteries and an important pathological manifestation of many cardiovascular diseases. H2S has a variety of vascular protective effects, including inhibition of regulating blood pressure and vascular tone, reducing oxidative stress, preventing platelet aggregation and leukocyte adhesion, promoting endothelial cell proliferation, inhibiting vascular proliferation and migration, and finally inhibiting low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and foam cell formation (Mani et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2011) (Fig. 1 ). Proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) is one of the characteristic causes of atherosclerosis (Dzau et al., 2002). H2S is an effective inhibitor of VSMC proliferation and migration both in vivo and in vitro (Du et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2006). Overexpression of H2S releasing compound and CSE gene showed inhibition of VSMC growth in vitro (Du et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2004). H2S can down-regulate CX3CR1 expression in macrophages by activating PPAR-γ or inhibit atherosclerosis via NF-κB/ICAM-1 pathway (Wang et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2012). Other studies have shown that the loss or reduction of CSE producing H2S or its activity may lead to endothelial dysfunction and accelerate the development of atherosclerosis (Eme and Doolittle 2015). The H2S-induced vasodilation effect is mainly through a non-endothelial-dependent manner, and a small contribution through an endothelium-dependent mechanism. Non-endothelial dependent means activation of vascular smooth muscle K+ channels, reducing intracellular pH and metabolic inhibition and intracellular acidification (Gheibi et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2007; Kiss et al., 2008). In rat aortic tissue, removal of the endothelium and blocking of nitric oxide synthase weakened H2S-induced vasodilation. This suggests that the vasodilating effect of H2S is partially dependent on endothelial and nitric oxide (NO) (Zhao and Wang 2002)."
4,Gut microbiota and atherosclerosis,"The human intestinal tract contains up to 100 trillion (1 × 1014) microbes, each of which has its own unique function in the intestine (Qin et al., 2010). The mammalian gut microbiota is one of the sources of various metabolites and can influence the adjustment of the circulatory system. First, gut bacteria and their metabolites can stimulate the enteric nervous system and then communicate with the brain through afferent sensory fibers, which may affect the activity of the brain center involved in the control of the circulatory system (Ufnal 2012). Second, gut bacteria and their metabolites may enter the circulation to influence the function of organs and tissues that play the main function in the homeostasis of the circulatory system (Tomasova et al., 2016). Gut microbiota metabolizes fats, carbohydrates, proteins and many other compounds. These compounds enter the intestines along with food and enterohepatic circulation, including short-chain fatty acids, aldehydes, alcohols, amines, aromatic derivatives of amino acids and gases such as methane, H2S, NO and carbon monoxide (CO). Gut microbiota and its metabolites are closely related to the production and development of atherosclerosis, and also affect the stability of atherosclerotic plaque. Ma et al.(Ma et al., 2017) Ma et al. found that trimethylamine-n-oxide (TMAO) promotes monocyte adhesion by up-regulating the level of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM1), and activates protein kinase c (PKC) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathways, causing endothelial cell dysfunction, which in turn affects early pathological process of atherosclerosis. Both carotid atherosclerosis and coronary atherosclerosis showed a decrease in Bacteroides and an increase in the ratio of the thick walled bacteria/Bacteroides. The severity of the disease is closely related to the reduction of probiotics such as Bacteroides, Plasmodium and Faecalibacterium (Li et al., 2017). Metabolites produced by the microbiota are taken up by intestinal epithelial cells and resident inflammatory cells. Its metabolites enter the circulation as a compound in the blood, reaching almost all organs and tissues that contribute to the homeostasis of the circulatory system. Unstable atherosclerotic plaque increases the risk of myocardial infarction. Early intervention on gut microbiota and its metabolites can help us better control the occurrence and progression of atherosclerosis, stabilize atherosclerotic plaque and reduce the risk of myocardial infarction."
5,Gut microbiota promotes atherosclerosis,"5.1 Gut microbiota promotes atherosclerosis The etiology and pathogenesis of atherosclerosis have not yet been fully elucidated and important risk factors affecting the onset - hyperlipidemia, obesity, diabetes and hypertension-are closely related to intestinal flora alteration (Marchesi et al., 2016; Cho and Blaser 2012). Koren et al.(Koren et al., 2011) used pyrosequencing to detect the bacterial composition of human carotid atherosclerotic plaques and found that the plaque flora coincides with the oral and intestinal microbiota. Analysis of bacterial metabolites in human intestinal and atherosclerotic plaques showed that the risk of human atherosclerosis and the promotion of atherosclerosis in mice are associated with the phosphatidylcholine metabolites choline, carnitine and TMAO (Hodge and Nunez 2016; Hazen and Brown 2014; Wang et al., 2011). Choline deficiency can cause muscle damage and fatty liver. The choline in the food is metabolized to trimethylamine (TMA) by the trimethylamine lyase contained in the gut microbiota, absorbed and transported to the liver through the portal vein, where it is oxidized by flavin monooxygenase (FMO) to form TMAO (Zhu et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2011; Bennett et al., 2013). TMAO is a small organic molecule that is an amine oxide. High concentrations of TMAO are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis, suggesting that the gut microbiota plays a key role in the occurrence of atherosclerosis (Ding et al., 2018). TMAO can increase the expression of scavenger receptor 36 (CD36) and scavenger receptor A (SRA) before atherosclerosis, which causes cholesterol accumulating in the cells, to promote foam cell formation, and inducing platelet hyperresponsiveness (Koeth et al., 2013). TMAO can induce the expression of inflammatory markers in endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells and increase the adhesion of white blood cells to endothelial cells, indicating that TMAO has a pro-inflammatory ability in both endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells (Matsumoto et al., 2020). TMAO hinders bile synthesis by inhibiting bile acid synthetase Cyp7a1, Cyp27a1 (Charach et al., 2012; Charach et al., 1998; Lu et al., 2010) and bile acid transporter expression in the liver to affect cholesterol clearance from the body. In addition, bile acids also affect different metabolic pathways through Takata G-protein coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) and the nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR). FXR has been shown to regulate FMO3, implying that bile acid metabolism interacts with the TMO pathway (Verhaar et al., 2020). The level of TMAO in the blood depends on a variety of factors, including gut microbiota composition, diet, liver oxidation of TMA, levels of methylamine excretion and the function of the GBB that controls the entry of visceral-derived molecules into the blood (Nowinski and Ufnal 2018). TMAO plasma levels in humans, rats and mice ranged from 0.5 to 10 μmol/L (Nowinski and Ufnal 2018)."
6,Gut microbiota against atherosclerosis,"5.2 Gut microbiota against atherosclerosis 5.2.1 TMA inhibitor Therapies targeting the gut microbiota and its metabolites are emerging as a new and attractive area of research for cardiovascular disease. Trimethylamine oxide will naturally be the first to be noticed. Some antibiotics may have potential as anti-atherosclerotic drugs and a new intestinal strain has been found to catabolize TMA (Li et al., 2017). Wang et al.(Wang et al., 2015) found that 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol (DMB) inhibited TMA production. The therapeutic mechanism of DMB is different from that of cholesterol-lowering drugs and its target is the molecular pathway of intestinal bacteria rather than the metabolic enzymes in human cells. Because it does not kill intestinal bacteria and rarely causes bacteria to become resistant to drugs, and may be an ideal candidate for the treatment of atherosclerosis (Wang et al., 2015). In addition, supplementing ApoE−/- mice with 0.4% resveratrol significantly remodeled intestinal microorganisms to limit TMAO production (Cheng et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2016). 5.2.2 Fecal microbiota transplantation The research on the clinical treatment of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is increasing and receiving special attention, and has achieved remarkable results in the clinical treatment of C. difficile infection (Azuma et al., 2000). Fecal microbiota transplantation is to transfer the gut microbiota from the donor to the recipient's intestine, which can increase the diversity and change the composition of the gut microbiota (John and Mullin 2016; Cammarota et al., 2014; Parekh et al., 2014). Ramezani et al.(Ramezani et al., 2018) showed that intestinal colonization with certain methanogenic archaea (MA) reduced the plasma concentration of TMAO. However, fecal microbiota transplantation carries the risk of transmitting unknown bacteria and viruses to the recipient (Kelly et al., 2015). Therefore, developing this method is relatively difficult. 5.2.3 Archaea The archaea lifestyle includes aerobic and anaerobic respiration. Gaci et al. found that methanogenic archaea M. smithii and M. stadtmanae exist in the human intestine. Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis B10 reduces the concentration of TMA in the intestine by metabolizing TMA to odorless inert gas methane (Wang 2002). All of these may play a role in anti-atherosclerosis, but more tests are needed to confirm their ability to inhibit this disease. 5.2.4 Probiotic Probiotics are a general term for active beneficial microorganisms that are present in the human gut and produce health benefits, mainly including lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. The intake of exogenous probiotics can directly or indirectly affect the host gut microbes. The direct effect can be achieved by directly changing the type and structure of the original flora in the intestine. The indirect effect refers to the effect on the metabolism of short-chain fatty acids, bile acid metabolism, the absorption of minerals in the intestines and the enzyme activity in the intestine after ingestion (Andrade et al., 2015; Tilg and Moschen 2015). A variety of probiotic preparations have been used in China and abroad to regulate intestinal flora imbalance and probiotics for the extraction of active ingredients from fermented Chinese medicine to treat diseases. 5.2.5 Dietary intervention Diet is a major external factor in the development of cardiovascular disease, and long-term diet is a major determinant of microbial type (Wu et al., 2011). To date, the evidence that lifestyle effects on cardiovascular health are mediated by gut microbes is limited. However, there are many reports in the literature that a high-fiber diet and the use of high-quality dietary fats gut and reduce the content of harmful bacteria, thus reducing blood pressure and preventing atherosclerosis (Marques et al., 2017; Gerdes et al., 2020; Mas-Capdevila et al., 2020). Therefore, nutritional interventions tailored to individual differences may become new treatments for cardiovascular disease."
7,"Gut microbiota, hydrogen sulfide and atherosclerosis","Gut microbiota and its metabolites are closely related to the onset and development of atherosclerosis and also affect the stability of atherosclerotic plaque. Hydrogen sulfide is widely studied as both inflammatory stimulator and anti-inflammatory factor (Tables 1 and 2 ). The physiological concentration of H2S can reach 50–160 μmol/L (Wang 2002, 2012). Numerous studies have shown that H2S and its oxidation products help to regulate the circulatory system. In general, physiological levels of H2S can reduce myocardial damage, protect the vascular endothelium, inhibit inflammation, and regulate blood pressure. However, H2S has a very short half-life in vivo, often ranging from a few seconds to a few minutes (Mani et al., 2014). It has been found that H2S can play a direct role in a paracrine manner and store it in the form of acid labile sulfur and/or bound sulfanil sulfur, which is then delivered to various tissues and responded to physiological signal release (Teng et al., 2013). The opening of ATP-sensitive channels appears to be one of the mechanisms of H2S-dependet vasodilation. In addition, the hemodynamic effects of H2S may also depend on H2S releasing NO from S-nitrosothiols and interacting with NO to form bioactive products (Cortese-Krott et al., 2015; Berenyiova et al., 2015; Ondrias et al., 2008). H2S also can be oxidized to thiosulfate and other products which have been verified to have remarkable biological effects. Studies have shown that the reduction of endogenous H2S synthesis is one of the causes of hypertension (Nowinski and Ufnal 2018). A study by Yang et al.(Yang et al., 2008) showed that gene deletion of cystathionine γ-lyase, an enzyme that synthesizes H2S, produces hypertension in mice. Lenka et al.(Tomasova et al., 2016) have shown that intraluminal administration can provide longer effective tissue concentrations of H2S and its active derivatives. The authors found that intracutaneous injection administration of Na2S significantly increased thiosulfate and sulfanil levels in portal plasma. This provides strong evidence that the hemodynamic effects of Na2S depend on increased intestinal absorption of H2S and its derivatives (Mishanina et al., 2015; Toohey and Cooper 2014)."
8,Summary and future directions,"As a gas signal molecule, H2S plays an important role in atherosclerosis lesions. Gut microbiota and its metabolites are closely related to the occurrence and development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The effects of dysbacteriosis, intestinal barrier destruction, chronic inflammation associated with intestinal flora translocation, TMAO, bile acids, short chain fatty acids. on CVD have been confirmed, but the mechanism of action remains to be further studied. In addition, how to exclude the differences in the intestinal flora of the individual, age, environment, diet and other influencing factors is also a difficult point of research. By studying the relationship between gut microbiota and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, it opens up new avenues for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Prevention and treatment can be achieved according to whether the metabolite is a bacterium that inhibits or promotes atherosclerosis, increases or decreases the concentration in the body, or increases or decreases the intestinal tract to produce such a metabolite. Although the gut microbiota is the largest source of H2S in the body, the effects of colon-derived H2S on the circulatory system still require extensive research. Taken together, these findings suggest a triangular relationship between gut microbiota, hydrogen sulfide and atherosclerosis, and intestinal sulfate-reducing bacteria and their products may be therapeutic targets for cardiovascular disease."
