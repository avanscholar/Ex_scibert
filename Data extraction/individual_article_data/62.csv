0,Introduction,"Biomass as a renewable resource for the production of chemicals and fuels has great potential for addressing energy and environmental issues [1]. Furfural (FFR) is considered as a key platform molecule for converting biomass feedstock into high value-added fuel due to its multifunctional nature of carbonyl (CO), π-conjugated (CC–CC) groups and five-membered ring structure [2]. And its primary hydrogenation product, furfuryl alcohol (FOL), can be used to produce fine chemicals, resins, vitamin C, lysine, lubricants, perfumes, dispersants and plasticizers, etc., with broad application prospects [3]. FFR catalytic hydrogenation to FOL can be carried out in a gas phase or liquid phase. Although the gas-phase continuous reaction is somewhat superior to the liquid-phase batch reaction, FFR is usually obtained by catalytic hydrolysis of xylose [4], which results in a large amount of energy consumption to vaporize the FFR solution in the gas-phase hydrogenation. The liquid-phase catalytic FFR hydrogenation is not only conducive to the connection with upstream products, but also to higher selectivity to FOL [5]. Furthermore, liquid-phase hydrogenation has mild reaction conditions and a clear hydrogenation mechanism. Therefore, the catalytic system for the liquid-phase catalytic FFR hydrogenation to FOL was preferentially explored by previous researchers. Noble metal catalysts, e.g. palladium [6–9], ruthenium [6,10] and platinum [7], exhibit high intrinsic hydrogenation activity, but excessive hydrogenation produces a large number of by-products, which makes the separation difficult. Moreover, the high cost and finite reserve of noble metals limit their extensive application. Therefore, it is meaningful to develop abundant non-noble metal catalysts. Ni-based catalysts [11,12] are known for their good hydrogenation properties, but due to the strong interaction between the furan ring and the Ni site [12], most of the Ni-based catalysts cause deep hydrogenation to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol. Although Co/ZrLa0.2Ox [13], CoB amorphous [14] and Al–Zr@Fe3O4 [15] catalysts have high selectivity to FOL, they have poor H2 activation and low stability. In addition, Cu-based catalysts have attracted great attention because of their unique catalytic performance. Have proved that the adsorption configuration of FFR on the surface of Cu is η1-(O)-aldehyde, making it tend to catalyze CO hydrogenation and avoid CC hydrogenation [16]. Sitthisa et al. [17] also reported that the strongest interaction between FFR and Cu surface. The furan ring is not firmly bound to Cu surface, and exhibits an increasing repulsive force. This is due to the partial overlap between the 3d band of Cu and the anti-bonding orbital of the furan ring. Moreover, Xiong et al. [18] showed that the tilted adsorption configuration of FFR is more stable than a perpendicular one. As shown in Scheme 1 , the FFR molecules are tilted adsorbed on Cu surface, while the H2 is also adsorbed and dissociated on the surface of Cu. Since FOL has two more hydrogen atoms than FFR, the process of FFR to FOL involves breaking of the CO bond and the addition of two activated hydrogen atoms. It implies that FFR hydrogenation to FOL involves two steps. It can be seen in Scheme 1 that, the conversion of FFR to FOL can be largely conducted through two competitive pathways (R1 and R2). The first reaction route is to add hydrogen to the carbon atom of the CO group to form an alkoxide intermediate, and then the second hydrogen is added to the oxygen atom in the alkoxide to form FOL. Unlike the R1, for the R2 reaction route, the hydrogen atom first attacks the oxygen atom in CO group, and then the carbon atom is hydrogenated to form FOL. Because of the low activation energy required to form ahydroxyalkyl intermediates [17], the R2 reaction mechanism is more acceptable. Cu-based catalysts, therefore, the hydrogenation mechanism is clear, avoid the hydrogenation of furan rings, and they are beneficial for the selective catalytic hydrogenation of CO bonds. Many studies have also shown that Cu-based catalysts have high selectivity for FFR catalytic hydrogenation to FOL [19–22]. In Cu-based catalysts, other metals are often introduced to improve their catalytic performance, such as CuZn [20], CuMgAl [19], CuFe [23], etc. Among them, ZnO has been shown to effectively improve the dispersibility of Cu, thereby providing more active sites for the reaction [24]. Moreover, ZnO is oxygenophilic, which protects the carbonyl group and reduces the decarbonylation. ZnO can also change the electron density of metallic Cu, thereby increasing catalytic activity and anti-deactivation activity [25]. In addition to introducing other metals, the activity and stability of Cu-based catalysts were closely related to the choice of the support [5]. For example, silica is widely used as a Cu-based catalyst support, because of its excellent physical and chemical properties, abundant natural resources, and low cost [19,26–28]. Recent research results showed that the preparation method of the catalyst has a great influence on the catalytic performance. Koley et al. [23] prepared Cu/CuFe2O4@C–B catalyst using metal-organic framework as a sacrificial template. The catalyst (Cu/CuFe2O4@C-A) exhibited extraordinary catalytic ability compared with the conventional Cu/CuFe2O4@C–B catalyst which was prepared by the wet impregnation method. Furthermore, metal-organic framework assisted preparation of PdCo3O4@NC and PdFe3O4@NC nanoparticles via facile in situ thermolysis, provides excellent catalytic activity for the reduction and upgrading of FFR [29]. Similarly, the Cu-based catalysts prepared by the conventional impregnation and deposition-precipitation methods have not only low dispersion of active Cu metal, but also weak interaction between the active Cu and the SiO2 support, leading to fierce aggregation and deactivation of active Cu particles under working conditions [30,31]. It is still a key challenge to synthesizing novel Cu-based catalysts with excellent activity and stability. Water is a green and inexpensive solvent that meets the requirements of green environmental protection. In this study, a series of new and efficient Cu-based catalysts were synthesized by an in-situ synthesis method on the surface of SiO2 microspheres, and then FFR was selectively hydrogenated to FOL with water as solvent. For comparison, SiO2 supported Cu catalysts were also prepared by conventional impregnation and deposition-precipitation methods to catalyze FFR hydrogenation to FOL. The prepared catalysts were characterized and the relationship between their physicochemical properties and catalytic properties was discussed. And the catalyst stability was investigated by cyclic experiments."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All chemicals were used as received without further purification. Furfural (AR, 99%), furfuryl alcohol (AR, 99%), ammonia water (AR, 25 wt%-28 wt%) and absolute ethanol were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Copper(Ⅱ) nitrate hydrate (AR, 99%), zinc(Ⅱ) nitrate hexahydrate (AR, 99%) and sodium carbonate anhydrous (Na2CO3) were purchased from Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China)."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation SiO2 microspheres (<400 nm) were synthesized using the Stöber method described in the literature [32]. First, 9 mL of ammonia was added to 25 mL of distilled water to form solution A. Secondly, 8 mL of ethyl orthosilicate was added to 45.5 mL of absolute ethanol to form solution B. Then solutions A and B were mixed and magnetically stirred at 313 K for 2 h to form a white turbidity liquid. Finally, it was washed several times with absolute ethanol: distilled water = 1:1 mixture, and the obtained SiO2 microspheres were dried for use. The Cu, Zn and Cu–Zn catalysts supported on SiO2 microspheres were prepared by an in-situ synthesis (IS) method. First, SiO2 microspheres were dispersed in deionized water to form a SiO2 suspension with SiO2/water weight ratio of 1:50, and a certain amount of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and/or Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was added to a diluted ammonia solution (6.7 wt%) to form a dark blue transparent liquid. Then, the SiO2 suspension was added dropwise to the above transparent liquid. After further magnetic stirring for 10 min, the resulting mixture was transferred to a hydrothermal reactor and kept at 413 K for 10 h. The obtained precipitate was washed, centrifugated, dried at 355 K for 6 h and calcined at 723 K for 4 h. After ground and sieved, the prepared catalyst was marked as Cu/SiO2-IS, Zn/SiO2-IS or Cu–Zn/SiO2-IS. By adjusting the addition of metal nitrate(s), all catalysts contained approximately the same metal loading, i.e. 20 wt% Cu, Zn or mixed Cu–Zn. For Cu–Zn/SiO2-IS preparation, different mass ratios of Cu(NO3)2 and Zn(NO3)2 were used to obtain three Cu–Zn/SiO2-IS samples with Cu/Zn atomic ratios of 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2, denoted as Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS, CuZn/SiO2-IS and CuZn2/SiO2-IS, respectively. Furthermore, SiO2 supported 20 wt% Cu catalyst was also prepared by incipient-wetness impregnation (IM) and deposition-precipitation methods (DP), as described elsewhere [19]. First of all, SiO2 microspheres were dispersed in a Cu(NO3)2 aqueous solution. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10 h, and then dried at 355 K for 6 h and calcined at 723 K for 4 h. The obtained sample were labeled as Cu/SiO2-IM. The Cu supported catalyst on SiO2 microspheres prepared by DP uses Na2CO3 as precipitator. First, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and excess Na2CO3 are separately dissolved in a certain amount of distilled water to form aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2 or Na2CO3, in order to ensure uniform precipitation, aqueous solution of the above two salts was simultaneously dropwise added to a suspension containing 0.5 g of SiO2 microspheres under magnetic stirring. Finally, resulting mixture was aged at 333 K for 1 h, followed by filtration and washing the precipitate, and then dried at 355 K for 6 h and calcined at 723 K for 4 h. The obtained catalysts were referred to as Cu/SiO2-DP."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were observed on a D/max-A diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm). The 2θ range was from 15° to 80° at a scanning rate of 20°/min. The crystalline phases were identified using the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS). The crystal size was calculated by Scherrer equation, D = Kλ/(βcosθ), where D is the average size of crystal in the direction perpendicular to the plane, K is the Scherrer constant which is usually regarded as 0.89, and λ is the incident X-ray wavelength, θ is the Bragg diffraction angle, and β is the half-height peak width of the diffraction peak. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the samples were recorded from 400 cm−1 to 4000 cm−1 using a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer equipped with a DTGS detector. The samples were mixed with KBr and plated before scanning with a spectral resolution of 4 cm−1. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a JEM-2100F equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray. Before measurement, catalysts were dispersed in ethanol. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was conducted on a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha + equipped with Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV). The binding energy was referred to the line position of C 1s (284.80 eV)."
5,Catalytic test,"2.4 Catalytic test Prior to test, all catalysts were reduced in a 120 mL/min H2 flow at 623 K for 2 h and then cooled down to ambient temperature in H2 flow. The FFR catalytic hydrogenation was carried out in a 250 mL stainless steel autoclave equipped with a magnetic stirring and electric heating furnace. 60 mL deionized water, 2 mL FFR and 0.3 g reduced catalyst were mixed in the autoclave and vigorously stirred at 800 rpm. After purging with hydrogen thrice, the autoclave was heated to 120 °C and hydrogen was further introduced up to 2.5 MPa. After 4 h reaction, the reactor was cooled down naturally. After filtration, aqueous phase was collected and analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC-126) equipped with FID and SE-54 capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm). The FFR conversion and specific product selectivity or yield were calculated by the following equations: (1) Conversion ( % ) = moles of FFR converted moles of initial FFR × 100 (2) Yield ( % ) = moles of specific product moles of initial FFR × 100 (3) Selectivity ( % ) = moles of specific product moles of FFR converted × 100"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characteristics,"3.1 Catalyst characteristics The crystallite structures of the calcined Cu/SiO2-IS, Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS, Cu/SiO2-DP and SiO2, reduced Cu/SiO2-IS and Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS, and used Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS catalysts are shown in Fig. 1 . A broad diffraction peak appearing at around 22° can be detected in all the catalysts, which is ascribed to SiO2, demonstrating the successful preparation of the SiO2. As show in Fig. 1a, diffraction peaks for Cu/SiO2-DP are 2θ = 35.6°, 38.7°, 48.7°, 58.3°, 61.8°, corresponding to the (002), (111), (202), (202) and (113) facets of CuO, respectively, which matches the standard data of a tenorite phase (JCPDS 89–2529). As shown by the vertical dotted line in this figure, diffraction peaks observed for calcined Cu/SiO2-IS and Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS samples at 2θ of 20.4°, 31.2°, 35.8°, 57.3° and 63.2° are assigned to CuSiO3, which matches the standard data of a typical layered copper silicate phase (JCPDS 3–0219). The weak diffraction peaks of this layered copper silicate were also observed in the report by Zhu et al. [33]. Unlike the calcined Cu/SiO2-DP sample, the diffraction peaks of CuO did not appear in the calcined Cu/SiO2-IS and Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS samples, indicating that the Cu species completely changed into CuSiO3. Compared with the calcined Cu/SiO2-IS sample, the layered copper silicate diffraction peak in Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS sample is not obvious. On the one hand, the content of Cu is relatively small, and the more important reason is that the addition of Zn increases the dispersion of Cu species [24]. As can be seen from Fig. 2 b, in the reduced Cu/SiO2-IS sample, the characteristic peak at 2θ = 62.7° indicates the existence of CuO, which may be caused by the decomposition of CuSiO3 in the sample during the reduction process. In addition, the broad peaks appearing at 2θ = 36.4° and 43.3° in the reduced Cu/SiO2-IS and Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS samples can be attributed to Cu2O (111) (JCPDS 65–3288) and Cu (111) (JCPDS 65–9743) [34], respectively. The characteristic peaks at 50.5 and 73.8 indicate that the CuSiO3 was reduced to elemental Cu. This phenomenon indicates that Cu2O and Cu appear after the samples are reduced, and it can also be seen that the diffraction peak of Cu2O in the reduced Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS sample is not obvious, indicating that the addition of Zn promotes the reduction of Cu2+ and Cu+. The XRD of used Cu2Zn/SiO2–SI sample is also shown in Fig. 1b. It can be seen that the characteristic peak type and intensity of Cu have no obvious change. The particle size of Cu was calculated by Scherrer equation to be about 6.3 nm, only a small increase in the size of Cu particles (the particle size was about 5.7 nm) was observed in reduced Cu2Zn/SiO2–SI, indicating that Cu2Zn/SiO2–SI catalyst has good thermal stability. As shown in Fig. 2, the colors of the calcined Cu/SiO2-IS samples are very different, the Cu/SiO2-IS catalyst prepared by IS method is green, and does not exhibit the color of CuO, while the samples prepared by the IM and the DP both exhibit the color of CuO, especially the Cu/SiO2-DP sample is dark brown. This also indicates that the Cu species of the calcined catalyst prepared by the IS method is different from those of Cu/SiO2-IM and Cu/SiO2-DP. The TEM characterization can give detailed information about the shape of the catalyst. Fig. 3 shows typical TEM images of calcined Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS catalyst. It can be seen that the SiO2 microspheres are uniform in size, and about 400 nm in diameter. In addition, a uniform layer of silicate on the surface of SiO2 microspheres is observed. The shape of silicate is floc and the thickness is about 50 nm. This silicate growing on the surface of SiO2 microsphere may be due to the fact that the surface of SiO2 microsphere dissolves in ammonia solution, forming silicate ions, and reacts with Cu2+ and/or Zn2+ released by ammonia complexation ions to form silicate. Among them, the dissolution of SiO2 microspheres occurs simultaneously with the formation of silicate. Fig. 4 shows the FTIR spectra of calcined catalysts to determine the presence of copper silicate. Characteristic peaks of 1093 cm−1 and 800 cm−1 are designated as antisymmetric stretching vibration and symmetric tensile vibration of Si–O–Si, and the peaks at 3449 cm−1 and 1636 cm−1 are attributed to the tensile and bending vibration of the O–H bond in the surface water molecules, respectively [35]. In addition, the peak at 467 cm−1 is caused by the bending vibration of Si–O. However, the tensile and bending vibration peaks of the O–H bond shared by three copper atoms at the octahedral position are small bands centered at 3610 cm−1 and 675 cm−1 [36]. Compared with Cu/SiO2-IM and Cu/SiO2-DP, the disappearance of the peak at 630 cm−1 in the calcined Cu/SiO2-IS and Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS samples (corresponding to the tensile vibration of Cu–O) confirmed that the Cu2O phase completely changed to copper silicate [37]. The surface chemical nature of Cu and Zn species of the calcined Cu/SiO2-IS and Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS catalysts were investigated by XPS analysis. Although Zn related species is not found in the characterization of XRD and FTIR, but as shown in Table 1 , the chemical composition of the calcined Cu/SiO2-IS and Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS samples obtained from the XPS results (Atomic %). Both samples contain Cu species, and the atomic percentage of Zn in the Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS sample is 4.57%, indicating the successful introduction of Zn species. Furthermore, according to the general XPS spectra shown in Fig. 5 a, the characteristic peak of Zn species is clearly present in Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS sample, also indicating the successful preparation of bimetallic component silicate. In order to further testify the copper species in calcined Cu/SiO2-IS and Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS catalysts, the XPS spectra of Cu 2p were collected. As observed in Fig. 5b, the calcined Cu/SiO2-IS and Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS catalysts exhibit peaks located at 935.6 eV. This is assigned to Cu 2p3/2, which is the characteristic of CuSiO3 species [38], indicating the successful synthesis of copper silicate by in-situ synthesis method. It is also consistent with the XRD result. In addition, the two calcined catalysts show the Cu 2p3/2 peaks at 933.1 and 943.1 eV, which are the characteristic of CuO species [39]. The appearance of CuO may be due to the decomposition of a small part of the copper silicate during the calcination process. Because CuO content is very small and highly dispersed, there are no characteristic peaks in the XRD of the calcined Cu/SiO2-IS and Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS samples. Fig. 5c shows Zn 2p spectra of the calcined Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS catalyst. The Zn 3p3/2 peaks occur at 1021.9 and 1022.6 eV, illustrating that the Zn valence exists mainly as +2, and these two peaks correspond to the ZnO and Zn2SiO4 species, respectively. Similarly, the formation of ZnO may also be caused by the decomposition of Zn2SiO4 during the calcination of the sample. In short, CuSiO3 and CuO species are contained in both calcined Cu/SiO2–SI and Cu2Zn/SiO2–SI catalysts. It can be seen from XRD that CuO and CuSiO3 can be transformed into Cu2O and Cu after reduction. Therefore, it can be inferred that both Cu2O and Cu are contained in the reduced Cu/SiO2–SI and Cu2Zn/SiO2–SI catalysts. For calcined Cu2Zn/SiO2–SI, there are also two existing states of Zn species, namely ZnO and Zn2SiO4. Among them, ZnO interacts with Cu, and Zn2SiO4 acts as a support to support ZnO and Cu."
8,Catalytic performance,"3.2 Catalytic performance For FFR hydrogenation over Cu/SiO2-IS, Zn/SiO2-IS and Cu–Zn/SiO2-IS catalysts, the experimental results are listed in Table 2 . FOL is the main product under the experimental conditions used in this work. However, accompanied by FOL, a trace of 2-methylfuran (2-MF) is also produced for FFR hydrogenation over these catalysts, indicating that excessive hydrogenation exists in the process of FFR catalytic hydrogenation. The relatively low yield of 2-MF indicates that the side reaction is effectively limited, and these catalysts have high selectivity to FOL. Obviously, the catalytic activities of these catalysts are quite different. The results of hydrogenation reaction of FFR on reduced Cu/SiO2-IS catalysts prepared by different methods are shown in entries 1–3. For comparison, the Cu source used in the three methods to prepare these catalysts remains the same. The dry, calcination and the reduction temperatures are completely consistent, and the catalytic hydrogenation reaction system is also the same. The results show that the properties of Cu/SiO2-IM, Cu/SiO2-DP and Cu/SiO2-IS catalysts vary greatly in both reactant conversion and product yield. The Cu/SiO2-IS catalyst has a large difference in activity from Cu/SiO2-IM and Cu/SiO2-DP catalysts. It can be seen in entry 3 that Cu/SiO2-IS exhibits the highest FFR conversion and FOL yield, indicating that Cu/SiO2-IS catalyst prepared by in-situ synthesis method has higher catalytic activity than those prepared by conventional method. The catalytic performance of Cu/SiO2-IM catalyst is the worst. The catalytic activity of Cu/SiO2-DP catalyst is better than that Cu/SiO2-IM, which is consistent with the research results of Du et al. [38]. In order to explore the effect of active metals, various metal catalysts were assessed, and the results are shown in entry 3–7 in Table 2. It can be seen that the catalytic activity sequence of various catalysts is: Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS > Cu/SiO2-IS > CuZn2/SiO2-IS > CuZn2/SiO2-IS > Zn/SiO2-IS. Interestingly, although the conversion of FFR is the highest on Cu/SiO2-IS catalyst, the selectivity of FOL is relatively low. This indicates that during the hydrogenation of FFR, there are side reactions such as decarbonylation and deep hydrogenation. The large amount of by-products is not conducive to the separation and purification of the main products in industrial production. It can be seen in entry 7, the Zn/SiO2-IS exhibits the lowest FFR conversion and FOL selectivity among all the catalysts. This indicates that there is little hydrogenation activity when only ZnO is present in the catalyst. However, the Zn species is oxophilic and can protect the carbonyl group, so the addition of the second component Zn significantly increases the FOL selectivity [25]. In entry 3 and entry 4 of Table 2, the addition of Zn species effectively improves the selectivity of FOL, which also illustrates this point. In addition, previous studies have shown that the synergistic effect of Cu and ZnO is related to the strong metal support interaction between them. Under the condition of reduction, ZnO will partially cover the surface of Cu [40,41]. This interaction between ZnO and Cu may improve the stability and dispersion of Cu. Finally, previous XRD characterization results have demonstrated that the introduction of Zn species greatly promotes the reduction of Cu, providing more active sites for the reaction. The results also show that the bimetallic Cu–Zn/SiO2-IS catalyst with Cu/Zn atomic ratio of 2/1 has better intermetallic interaction, which makes the bimetallic catalyst have better catalytic activity. However, the addition of excessive Zn inhibits the activity of the catalyst to a certain extent, probably due to the excessive Zn species occupying a large number of active sites of Cu. In summary, there is an optimal interaction between Cu and Zn in the Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS catalyst, which changes the electronic properties of Cu metal and improves its dispersion and reducibility [24]. Therefore, bimetallic catalysts with different chemical properties from single metal catalysts inhibit decarbonylation and deep hydrogenation and promote the fracture of CO bonds, which is more suitable for the produce of FOL. In order to further evaluate the catalytic activity of Cu/SiO2-IS and Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS catalysts prepared by the in-situ synthesis method, they were compared with other Cu-based catalysts. The results are shown in Table 3 . It can be seen from the entries 1–3 in the table, the Cu/SiO2 catalysts prepared by the IM and DP have a lower FFR conversion and FOL yield, and the Cu/SiO2 catalyst prepared by the IS has higher catalytic performance. It shows that the catalyst prepared by IS has excellent hydrogenation activity. Entries 4 and 5 show supported Cu–Zn bimetallic catalysts. Although CuZn/Kieselguhr catalyst has higher FFR conversion and FOL yield, the pressure required for its reaction is too large, which is neither safe nor economical. The Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS catalyst prepared in this work achieves similar conversion and product yield under mild conditions, which is sufficient to illustrate the excellent catalytic performance of the Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS catalyst prepared in this work. Finally, although the catalytic performance of the CuCo/SiO2 catalyst shown in entry 5 is similar to that of the Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS catalyst prepared in this work, but the reaction conditions are not mild. In addition, compared with Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS, the FFR conversion is higher on the CuCo/SiO2 catalyst, but the FOL yield is lower, indicating that the selectivity of the CuCo/SiO2 catalyst is also significantly lower than Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS in this work. In short, the Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS catalyst prepared by IS method has better catalytic performance than other methods, and it possesses a great potential as catalyst for FFR hydrogenation to FOL under a moderate reaction condition. Furthermore, the hydrogenation of FFR to FOL is a volume reduction reaction, and increasing the hydrogen pressure can increase the conversion rate of FFR. The Cu/SiO2-IS catalyst used in entry 3 in Table 3 is prepared by IS method. Due to the fact that the surface of SiO2 microsphere dissolves in ammonia solution, forming silicate ions, and reacts with Cu2+ released by ammonia complexation ions to form silicate on the surface of SiO2 microsphere. As shown in Fig. 3, the silicate on the surface of SiO2 increases the specific surface area of the catalyst. However, the entry 2 in Table 3, Cu/SiO2(I) catalyst prepared by traditional impregnation method, Cu species will not only block the pore structure of SiO2, cause the specific surface area to decrease, and the dispersion of Cu will also decrease. Therefore, catalyst prepared by IM method has lower activity. In the entry 2 and entry 3 in Table 2, the activity data of the two catalysts measured under the same conditions also illustrate this point. To explore the catalyst stability and reusability, circular tests in FFR catalytic hydrogenation to FOL were conducted over Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS catalyst with the best catalytic performance, 60 mL deionized water, 2 mL FFR and 0.3 g reduced catalyst were mixed in the autoclave and vigorously stirred at 800 rpm, under H2 pressure of 2.5 MPa at 393 K for 4 h. After each reaction, catalyst was separated from reaction solution by centrifugation. The obtained catalyst was washed with absolute ethanol and dried at 355 K overnight, and then calcined at 723 K for 4 h to remove deposited carbon. Finally, the calcined catalyst was reduced in a 120 mL/min H2 flow at 623 K for 2 h and then cooled down to ambient temperature in H2 flow. The pre-reduced catalyst was again used to test the FFR catalytic reaction. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 6 . After the fourth assessment of the recovered sample, the FFR conversion over Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS is close to 73% and the selectivity to FOL still reaches 80%, indicating that the reduced Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS catalyst has a good catalytic stability. The good stability of the catalyst may be attributed to the fact that the presence of a strong metal-support interaction between the ZnO and Cu. ZnO will partially cover the surface of Cu under the condition of reduction [40,41], as a protective layer for Cu. Thus, the anti-deactivation activity of Cu is reduced."
9,Conclusions,"The Cu/SiO2 catalysts prepared by different methods were used to catalyze the hydrogenation of FFR to FOL in aqueous phase. Different preparation methods have significant effects on the microstructure and copper species of the samples. Cu/SiO2-IS catalyst prepared by in-situ synthesis method has no obvious CuO after calcination, and the active component appears after the catalyst is reduced. The formation of flocculent silicates increases the specific surface area and dispersion of Cu, making the in-situ synthesized Cu/SiO2-IS have better catalytic activity than those by impregnation and deposition-precipitation. Moreover, the addition of Zn species has a significant promoting effect on Cu-based catalysts, Zn species not only promote the reduction of CuO, improve the dispersion of Cu, provide more active sites for the reaction, but also effectively prevent the decarbonylation reaction and improve the selectivity of FOL. Bimetallic catalyst having Cu/Zn atomic ratio of 2/1 showed the best catalytic activity. After repeated use of this catalyst for four times, there is no obvious deactivation of the catalytic reaction, indicating that Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS catalyst has good catalytic stability. Therefore, Cu2Zn/SiO2-IS catalyst has excellent catalytic performance and has great potential as an industrial catalyst for FFR aqueous phase catalytic hydrogenation to FOL."
