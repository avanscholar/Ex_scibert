0,Introduction,"With the growth of energy demand, petroleum alternative fuels like coal-based oils have attracted increasing attention [1,2]. As a low-rank coal, lignite is rich in heteroatom-containing aromatics [3]. The content of oxygen in lignite is higher than that in bituminous coal and anthracite, and results in a lower calorific value [4,5]. During coal utilization like combustion, nitrogen and sulfur are released as NOx and SOx, respectively, and cause environmental pollution such as acid rain, photochemical pollution and smog [6,7]. Therefore, the removal of heteroatoms in lignite plays a key role in the production of coal-based oils. Heteroatoms exist as different functional groups in the organic matter of coal. According to the analysis using 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Allen et al. [8] reported that the organic oxygen in a lignite mainly existed in the form of aryl ether and partially as furan. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy were used to study the chemical form of organic nitrogen-containing compounds in coals, which was mainly pyridines [9,10]. Most of organic sulfur-containing compounds in coals were found in the form of thioethers, thiols and thiophenes by using a pyroprobe gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) [11]. To reach efficient and clean utilization of coal, catalytic hydrogenation for coal has been developed and is regarded as one of the most effective methods producing clean liquid fuels [12,13]. During catalytic hydrogenation, heteroatoms can be effectively removed from organic matter in coal. Considering the compositional complexity of organic matter in coal, coal-related model compounds (CRMCs) are an option to study the reactivity of organic matter in coal [14]. Aromatic compounds containing heteroatoms were often used as CRMCs to investigate the mechanisms of heteroatom removal during the production of coal-based fuels [15,16]. Catalytic hydrogenation of dibenzyl ether, a CRMC, was studied using Ni/Z5A as the catalyst [17]. Active H was proven attacking the C–O bridge bond in dibenzyl ether to obtain methylcyclohexane and toluene. Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid was studied in the catalytic hydrogenation of two CRMCs, benzyloxybenzene and diphenylmethane [18]. The C–O and C–C bridge bonds in the two CRMCs were broken by the attacking of H radicals. Both CRMCs were almost completely converted into monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In recent years, bimetallic catalysts have been widely studied for the effects of heteroatom removal during hydrogenation [19,20]. Baeza et al. [21] studied a Co-Mo bimetallic catalyst used in removing heteroatoms from a lignite, and proved that Co and Mo atoms impregnated on the surface of a single support exhibited a higher catalytic activity and synergistic effect. Liaw et al. [22] studied the hydrogenation reactions of a coal-derived naphtha catalyzed by Ni–Mo/Al2O3 and Co-Mo/Al2O3. Ni–Mo/Al2O3 exhibited a higher activity during hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reactions, while had a lower catalytic activity in hydrodesulfurization (HDS) compared to Co-Mo/Al2O3. Compared with single metal catalysts (Co/γ-Al2O3 or Mo/γ-Al2O3), a bimetallic catalyst Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3 exhibited an enhanced conversion rate during HDS, around 10 times [23]. Bimetallic catalyst has good activity in the catalytic reactions of HDS, HDN and HDO because of the synergistic effect of binary metals. In this work, a series of Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic supported catalysts were prepared by impregnation method. Four CRMCs were selected to study on the catalytic activity of the bimetallic catalysts in HDS, HDN and HDO reactions. The proposed reaction pathways of CRMCs and the corresponding catalytic mechanisms of Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic supported catalysts were explored, which provided a theoretical basis for directional conversion and heteroatom removal of lignite."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials n-hexane (analytical pure) was purchased from Xilong Scientific Co., Shantou, China and γ-Al2O3 was bought from Jikang New Material Co. LTD, Hangzhou, China. (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (>99.9%), Co(NO3)2·6H2O (>99.9%) and four CRMCs (dibenzyl ether, furan, thiophene and quinoline) with purity higher than 99.9% were purchased from Aladdin Reagent Co., shanghai, China."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation A series of Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic supported catalysts with different Mo/Co molar ratios were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method. The support γ-Al2O3 was dried in a blast dryer for 2 h. Deionized water was added to make the support viscous and saturated with water. (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O and Co(NO3)2·6H2O with different Mo/Co molar ratios (Mo/Co = 1.6, 2.0, 2.4, 2.8 and 3.2) were dissolved in deionized water to obtain mixed solutions. 1.0 g dried γ-Al2O3 was added into a solution, standing for 12 h and then drying in an oven at 110 °C for 4 h. The dried powder was calcined in air atmosphere at 550 °C for 4 h to oxidize Co and Mo. Previous researches reported that sulfided Co-Mo catalysts can activate H2 for the catalytic removal of heteroatom in hydrocarbon streams than oxidized catalysts [24,25]. Through a sulfidation treatment, metal oxides could be completely converted into metal sulfides, which enhanced the activity and stability of catalysts [26]. In this work, 0.4 g oxidized catalyst and 0.1 g sulfur powder were put into a 100 mL stainless steel autoclave. After replacing air in the autoclave with N2, the autoclave was pressurized with H2 to 4 MPa at room temperature. Then the autoclave was heated at a heating rate of 10 °C/min till 320 °C and kept at the temperature for 120 min. After vulcanization, the excess sulfur was removed by CS2 extraction to obtain the sulfurized catalyst."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The specific surface area and pore size distribution of the catalysts were measured on a gas sorption analyzer (Autosorb iQ/MP-XR, Quantachrome Instruments Co., USA) using N2 adsorption-adsorption technology. Prior to the measurement, the catalysts were degassed at 300 °C for 3 h to remove any adsorbed gas/moisture on the surface. Temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) experiments were performed on a Chem-Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) Pulsar temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)/TPD chemisorption analyzer (ChemBET Pulsar, Quantachrome Instruments Co., USA) to understand the acidity of the catalyst. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Quanta TM 250, FEI Co., USA) and field emission transmission electron microscope-energy dispersion spectroscopy (TEM-EDS, Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN, FEI Co., USA) were employed to investigate the morphology of the catalysts. XPS was recorded on a Thermo Fisher Scientific Escalab 250Xi spectrometer (USA) using a monochromatic Al-Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV) as the excitation source. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the catalysts were recorded by a Bruker D8 Advance powder diffractometer (Germany) using a Cu Kα (k = 0.15406 nm) radiation at a scanning rate of 0.2 s/step."
5,Catalytic conversion of CRMCs,"2.4 Catalytic conversion of CRMCs To investigate the conversion pathways of CRMCs and the catalytic mechanisms of Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalysts, 0.1 g Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3, 1 mmol CRMC, and 20 mL cyclohexane were put into a 250 mL stainless steel and magnetically stirred autoclave. After replacing air in the autoclave with N2, the autoclave was pressurized with H2 at room temperature till an initial pressure. Then the autoclave was heated at a heating rate of 10 °C/min till a specific temperature and kept at the temperature for a certain time. The detailed reaction conditions are listed in Table S1. The reaction mixture was filtered through a polytetrafluoroethylene membrane with a pore size of 0.45 μm to obtain filtrate and residue. Each filtrate was analyzed with an Agilent 7890/5975 GC/MS and the MS data were processed by using MSD ChemStation software. Meanwhile, dodecane was used as the internal standard compound for quantitative analysis of the products."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of catalysts 3.1.1 BET analysis Fig. 1 shows the nitrogen adsorption desorption curves of the support γ-Al2O3 and the catalyst Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3. According to the standard division of adsorption desorption isotherm, the two adsorption desorption curves in Fig. 1 belong to both type II adsorption isotherm and H Ⅲ hysteresis loop, implying the existence of mesoporous structures [27]. The pore size distribution and detailed textural properties of the materials are summarized in Fig. 2 and Table 1 , respectively. As expected, the catalyst exhibits a narrower pore size distribution than the support. The specific surface area, pore volume and pore diameter of Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst are significantly lower compared with γ-Al2O3, indicating that active components of the catalyst are successfully dispersed in micropores and mesopores of the support. Similar characteristics are exhibited in the two curves in Fig. 2, where the pore volume of the support decreases significantly after loading the active components. 3.1.2 NH3-TPD analysis NH3-TPD profiles for both γ-Al2O3 and Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3 are presented in Fig. S1. The desorption peak below 350 °C belongs to the absorption peak of weak acid, while the desorption peak at 350–550 °C is related to the strong acid site [28]. The bimetallic catalyst shows a weak acid desorption peak at 204.2 °C and a strong acid desorption peak at 490.5 °C. Such desorption peaks are related to the acidic position of the support γ-Al2O3 [29–31]. However, a stronger acidic desorption peak appears at 654.3 °C, which does not appear on the desorption curve of γ-Al2O3, indicating that the addition of Co and Mo limited the formation of Lewis acid sites and formed Brønsted acid [30]. Therefore, the Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst has a strong reactivity. 3.1.3 SEM analysis Shown in Fig. 3 are SEM images of the γ-Al2O3 and the Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3 with various magnifications. The particle distribution of the support γ-Al2O3 is disordered without fixed shape. The particles of Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3 catalyst exhibit a spherical shape and uniform size. Comparing Fig. 3c and f, the Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3 SEM image shows some smaller particles, and the distribution of these particulate substances is relatively uniform. It illustrates that Co and Mo metal particles have been well deposited on the surface of support. 3.1.4 TEM-EDS analysis TEM images of the γ-Al2O3 support and the Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3 catalyst are shown in Fig. 4 with an average particle diameter of 2.1 and 3.0 nm, respectively, obtained by Image J. Compared to the clean surface of the support, a uniform distribution of metal particles clearly appears on the surface of γ-Al2O3 as shown in Fig. 4f, indicating successfully loading of active components. Comparing Fig. 4c and d, the bimetallic catalyst exhibits a distinct layered accumulation and distribution while not for the support. The layered stacking and distribution are formed due to the lattice mismatch between MoS2 and support, forming thin clusters on the crystal plane of catalyst [32]. According to the EDS data shown in Fig. S2, the Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3 catalyst contains only O, S, Co, Mo and Al elements on the surface, indicating that no impurity was introduced during the preparation of catalyst. 3.1.5 XPS analysis Shown in Fig. 5 a is the XPS spectrum of the bimetallic catalyst with a Co/Mo ratio at 1. The main elements on the surface of the catalyst are S, O, Co and Mo, which are consistent with the EDS data in Fig. S2. A strong O1s peak represents O in the support γ-Al2O3. Mo–O–S was formed when the active Mo was exposed to air at a low sulfurization temperature [33]. The sulfurization degree of Mo and the corresponding distribution on the support can be inferred from the Mo3d spectrum. The peak of Mo3d covers an energy range from 227 to 238 eV, overlapping with the binding energy of S2s [34]. Peak fitting for Mo3d-S2s is shown in Fig. 5b, and the binding energy and peak area of S2s are calculated based on the data in Table 2 . On the surface of catalyst, S exists in the form of sulfide, oxysulfide and sulfate, and the corresponding relative content are shown in Fig. S3. Mo3d shows a strong double band in Fig. 5b, indicating that Mo mainly exists in the form of Mo4+ [35,36]. In Fig. S3, the relative content of Mo6+ is 44.6% higher than that of Mo4+, which contradicts the results in Fig. 5b. The possible reason is that most of Mo6+ was not sulfurized during the preparation of catalyst because of the low temperature. According to the data in Fig. 5c and Fig. S3, the relative content of Co2+ is around 3 times of that of Co-Mo-S, because only a partial Co2+ was sulfurized during the preparation of catalyst. Therefore, Co mainly exists in the catalyst in the form of Co2+. 3.1.6 XRD analysis As shown in Fig. 6 , XRD was used to analyze the crystal structure characteristics of γ-Al2O3 and Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3. Uncured Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3 has a series of characteristic peaks similar to γ-Al2O3 (2θ = 25.65°, 35.22°, 37.85°, 43.41°, 52.61°, 57.57°, 66.54°, and 68.25°). After loading of Co and Mo, the crystal structure of γ-Al2O3 did not change, indicating that impregnation did not destroy the crystal structure of the support. The characteristic peaks of MoO3 (2θ = 12.76°, 23.50°, 27.33°, and 33.75°) and Al2(MoO4)3 (2θ = 14.14°, 15.64°, 20.87°, and 22.13°) result from the interactions between Mo and γ-Al2O3 [37]. However, the diffraction peaks of Co and Co-Mo-S were not observed, which were related to the high dispersion of Co species on the surface of γ-Al2O3 and the amorphous morphology of Co-Mo-S [38]."
8,Catalytic conversion of CRMCs,"3.2 Catalytic conversion of CRMCs The effects of Mo/Co molar ratio, reaction temperature, reaction time and initial hydrogen pressure on the catalytic hydroconversion of CRMCs were investigated, respectively. Table S1 shows the range of reaction parameters for hydroconversion of the CRMCs. As shown in Fig. S4, dibenzyl ether was used as a model compound to determine an optimized Mo/Co molar ratio to reach the best reaction activity. Furthermore, effects of reaction parameters on hydroconversion of the four CRMCs are exhibited in Fig. S5-S8. 3.2.1 Catalytic conversion of dibenzyl ether As shown in Fig. S4, toluene is the main product in the hydrocracking of dibenzyl ether, indicating the cracking of Calk-O bridge bond. Besides toluene, compounds like 1-benzyl-2-methylbenzene and 1,2-diphenylethane were also detected. With the increase of Mo/Co ratio, both the selectivity for toluene and the conversion of dibenzyl ether first increase and then decrease. The enhancement of selectivity and conversion might be related to the synergistic effect between Mo and Co, which can form a number of active sites contributing to hydrogenolysis reaction [39]. However, further increase to Mo/Co ratio can bring more MoS2, which limits the production of Co–Mo–S active phase and leads to a low selectivity and conversion [40]. A proper Mo/Co ratio can result in the highest activity during hydroconversion, and the optimal Mo/Co ratio was chosen as 2.4 for the following experiments. In addition, the effects of reaction temperature, reaction time and initial hydrogen pressure on the HDO of dibenzyl ether are shown in Fig. S5. Scheme 1 shows the proposed conversion pathways of dibenzyl ether. Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3 can promote the activation of H2 to H⋯H, which is further split into an immobile H− attached on Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3 and a mobile H+ [41]. In path 1 (including step 1, step 2, step 3, step 4 and step 5), due to the high electronegativity of oxygen atom, H+ preferentially attacks the oxygen atom in dibenzyl ether, resulting in the cleavage of Calk–O bridge bond to generate benzylium positive ions and phenylmethano. In step 1, benzylium cation attracts and strips the immobile H− adsorbed on the surface of Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3 to form toluene. According to step 2, phenylmethanol adsorbs mobile H+ to generate the protonated phenylmethanol, which can be dehydrated to form benzylium cation again in step 3. On the one hand, in step 4, phenylmethanol can react with toluene to remove H2O and generate 1,2-diphenylethane. On the other hand, phenylmethanol and toluene react with active hydrogen, and toluene is demethylated and dehydrated with phenylmethanol to form diphenylmethane as shown in step 5. In path 2 (including step 6, step 7, step 8, step 9 and step 10), benzylium cation undergoes an addition reaction at 2-position of phenylmethanol to obtain (2-benzylphenyl)methanol in step 6 and step 7. In step 8, (2-benzylphenyl)methanol adsorbs mobile H+ to form protonated benzyl alcohol, which is dehydrated to form 1-benzyl-2-methylbenzene cation in step 9. Finally, in step 10, 1-benzyl-2-methylbenzene cation attracts and strips the immobile H− adsorbed on the surface of Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3 to form 1-benzyl-2-methylbenzene. 3.2.2 Catalytic conversion of furan As demonstrated in Fig. S6, the main hydroconversion products of furan are tetrahydrofuran and butane. Fig. S6(a) illustrates the effect of temperature on the catalytic hydroconversion of furan. From 240 °C to 300 °C, the selectivity for butane and conversion of furan increased with reaction temperature, but the selectivity for tetrahydrofuran decreased. The possible reason is that with the increase of temperature, the activity of catalyst increases and more active hydrogen is produced. The conversion of furan, selectivity for butane and selectivity for tetrahydrofuran remained stable between 300 °C and 320 °C. Hence the catalytic hydrogenation temperature of furan was optimized to 300 °C. In addition, the initial hydrogen pressure and reaction time were also optimized as 3 MPa and 120 min, which are shown in Fig. S6(b) and (c), respectively. Shown in Scheme 2 is the proposed hydrogenation mechanism of furan. There are two possible reaction paths for the catalytic hydrogenation of furan. In path 1 (including step 1, step 2 and step 3), the CC bonds in heterocyclic ring are hydrogenated to form tetrahydrofuran as exhibited in step 1. In the following step 2, the C–O bonds in tetrahydrofuran are attacked by active hydrogen to break the C–O bond and generate butanol. The –OH in butanol is easy to combine with active hydrogen following by the removal of H2O and generation of stable butane in step 3. In path 2 (including step 4 and step 5), due to the strong electronegativity of O atom, active hydrogen attacks O atom and breaks C–O bonds to form butene (step 4). The unsaturated CC double bonds in butene are easily attacked by active hydrogen to form butane in step 5. 3.2.3 Catalytic conversion of thiophene The main hydrocracking product of thiophene is butane, indicating the cracking of C–S bond. Fig. S7 shows the effects of different reaction conditions on the catalytic hydrogenation of thiophene. The effects of reaction temperature on the catalytic hydrogenation of thiophene are shown in Fig. S7(a). The selectivity for butane and conversion of thiophene increased with reaction temperature. Tetrahydrothiophene was detected under 300 °C, because aromatic heterocyclic ring was hydrogenated to generate tetrahydrothiophene at a low temperature. With the increase of temperature from 300 °C to 320 °C, the cleavage of C–S bond can make the selectivity of butane close to 100%. Therefore, 320 °C is considered as the optimal temperature for producing butane with a high selectivity. Moreover, the initial hydrogen pressure and reaction time were optimized as 2 MPa and 100 min, which are shown in Fig. S7(b) and (c), respectively. Scheme 3 shows the proposed conversion mechanism of thiophene. There are two possible paths in the hydrodesulfurization of thiophene. First, direct desulfurization process occurs in step 1. The C–S bonds in thiophene molecule were broken by the attacking of active hydrogen, and 1,3-butadiene was formed. Sulfur vacancies on sulfurized Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3 catalyst provide reaction space for the hydrodesulfurization of sulfur-containing compounds [42]. Furthermore, due to the instability of CC bonds in 1,3-butadiene, it can be converted into butane with a higher stability via electrophilic addition reactions. Second, trace amount of tetrahydrothiophene was detected after the reaction. Compared with the direct cleavage of C–S bond in thiophene, hydrogenating of CC bond requires a lower energy barrier [43]. Therefore, the CC bond in thiophene molecule in step 2 is preferentially attacked by active hydrogen, with the generation of tetrahydrothiophene. Due to the existence of S vacancy on the catalyst, the C–S bonds in tetrahydrothiophene can be attacked by active hydrogen, and then butane is produced. 3.2.4 Catalytic conversion of quinoline The catalytic hydrogenation conversion of quinoline under different conditions is shown in Fig. S8. In Fig. S8(a), the conversion of quinoline increases with reaction temperature, and the main products are propylbenzene, 1-propylcyclohex-1-ene and propylcyclohexane. Intermediates like 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline and 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinoline were also detected, indicating that the hydrocracking of quinoline was carried out through the hydrogenation of both benzene ring and N-ring. The selectivity for propylbenzene, 1-propylcyclohex-1-ene and propylcyclohexane increases with reaction temperature from 260 °C to 340 °C. Since the maximum working temperature of the reactor is 340 °C, selectivities for these main products reach the highest value at 340 °C. Therefore, 340 °C is considered as the optimal temperature for the hydrogenation of quinoline. In addition, initial hydrogen pressure and reaction time were also optimized as 4 MPa and 180 min, which are shown in Fig. S8(b) and (c), respectively. Scheme 4 shows the proposed conversion mechanism of quinoline. Since the C–N bond on the heterocyclic ring is relatively strong, it is difficult to reach direct hydrodenitrogenation [44]. The hydrocracking of quinoline is realized through two paths, hydrogenation of nitrogen-containing heterocycles and benzene rings. Path 1 (including step 1, step 2, step 3, step 4, step 5, step 6, step 7 and step 10) shows the possible pathways via the hydrogenation of nitrogen ring. In step 1, active hydrogen atom attacks the unsaturated bond on the heterocyclic ring, resulting in hydrogenation and generating 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline. There are two possible pathways, step 2 and step 3, for the following conversion of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline. In step 2, the CC bonds on the aromatic ring of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline are attacked by active hydrogen, generating decahydroquinoline. In the following step 10, since C(SP3)–N bond in decahydroquinoline is easy to cleave [45], the breaking of C–N bond induces the formation of phenylcyclohexane. On the other hand, as shown in step 3, the C–N bond in the saturated heterocycle is attacked by active hydrogen, inducing the bond breaking to form 2-propylaniline. In the following step 4, due to the strong electron absorption ability of amino N atom in 2-propylaniline, the Car-N bond is attacked by active hydrogen, and NH3 is removed to form propylbenzene. Meanwhile, in step 6, more stable 1-propylcyclohex-1-ene was obtained by hydrogenation of propylbenzene. In step 7, 1-propylcyclohex-1-ene can easily undergo electrophilic addition with active hydrogen to form stable propylcyclohexane. Path 2 (including step 8, step 9 and step 10) shows the possible pathways via the hydrogenation of aromatic ring. As shown in step 8, the aromatic ring in quinoline is hydrogenated to generate 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinoline. In the following step 9, the heterocyclic ring in 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinoline continues to be hydrogenated to form decahydroquinoline, and phenylcyclohexane is formed in step 10 via the breaking of C–N bond. With a strong electronegativity, N atom can easily adsorb H⋯H to form a saturated ring. Data of GC/MS show that the yields of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline and 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinoline are 33.6% and 20.0%, respectively. Therefore, the main path for hydroconversion of quinoline is the hydrogenation of N-ring [46]."
9,Conclusions,"Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst exhibits a high activity for the catalytic hydrogenation of four CRMCs. Co and Mo particles were uniformly distributed on the surface of support γ-Al2O3, and strongly interacted with the γ-Al2O3 skeleton without agglomeration. In the catalytic hydroconversion process, Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3 can promote the activation of H2 to H⋯H, which further split into immobile H− attached on Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3 and mobile H+. In the hydrogenation of dibenzyl ether, toluene exhibited a selectivity at 75.3%, which was mainly caused by the breaking of Calk-O bond due to the transfer of H+ to oxygen atom. The hydroconversion of furan was realized via direct cracking and hydrogenation of heterocycles, generating butane and tetrahydrofuran as the main products. There are sulfur vacancies on the surface of sulfurized Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3, and π electrons in aromatic heterocycles are easy to pair with the active hydrogen atoms adsorbed to the Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3. For thiophene, the aromatic heterocycles were first hydrogenated, following by indirect removal of heteroatoms as the main path for hydroconversion. The hydroconversion of quinoline can be divided into two routes and the main route is hydrogenation of N-ring. In summary, the Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst exhibited excellent HDO, HDS and HDN effects. In particular, the Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst is selective for the hydrogenation of dibenzyl ether to toluene and provides an important theoretical basis for the directional conversion of organic matter in lignite."
