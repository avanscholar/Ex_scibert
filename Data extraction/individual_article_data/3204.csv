0,Introduction,"At the start of the 21st century, we face significant energy challenges. As a main energy source used, fossil fuel has been overly consumed and is one of the significant causes of global warming and acid rain. The sustainable development urgently calls for a new energy source alternative fossil fuel [1,2]. Hydrogen, a renewable and entirely carbon-free fuel with a high combustion enthalpy (185kJ/l), is regarded as an alternative to fossil fuel [3]. Its application to fuel cells is a typical example [4,5]. To date, hydrogen is produced in large amounts by the chemical and physical methods, e.g. the steam reforming, partial oxidation of fossil fuels, which make hydrogen production expensive and further environment pollution occurs [2,6]. In contrast, hydrogen generation via biological routes is economical, highly effective, and pollution free. It is expected that it will be the main feasible approach for supplying hydrogen energy in the future [2]. Hydrogen can be produced by four kinds of microbes, including anaerobic fermentative bacteria, photosynthetic bacteria, cyanobacteria, and algae [6–11]. But most of the relevant researches on them almost used pure cultures as biocatalysts and were carried out on a laboratory scale [7,8]. The mixed anaerobic fermentative bacteria have significant advantages in economical energy production. This bio-energy process not only couples the need for waste treatment on a large scale and hydrogen recovery under mild operating conditions, but also couples high hydrogen production rates and low energy requirement [12,13]. But hydrogen production via acclimated sewage sludge or facultative anaerobe has been analyzed only in a few works, and these researches mainly focus on the mechanism of hydrogen production on batch experiment from single carbohydrates or continuous hydrogen production on a laboratory scale [14–17]. In the present study, facultative anaerobes were a mixed microbial system containing hydrogen production bacteria and other anaerobic microbes. Compared with other hydrogen-producing bacteria such as sludge anaerobic bacteria, hydrogen-producing bacteria used in our research have many merits, e.g. shorter hydraulic retention time (HRT) and easier acclimatization. An improved 50 m 3 upward-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor was used, whose cubage is by far larger than for other pilot-scale experiments [15–17] and closer to practical production. It is well known that if the HRT was short, facultative anaerobes would be predominant in this system by virtue of their shorter generation time (8–12h) than that of methanogenic bacteria (1–2days). But over-short HRT makes the treatment efficiency low. Therefore, finding the optimum HRT is a key for effective continuous hydrogen production [18–20]. Furthermore, optimized operating parameters and the feasibility of employing UASB reactor were also investigated."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Wastewater,"2.1 Wastewater Citric acid wastewater from a local factory was used in this investigation. The characteristics of the raw wastewater are given in Table 1 . This kind of raw wastewater was used as a single carbon source, without any balanced nutrients supplemented, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and other nutrient microelement. But for the influent pH stability, a buffer tank was prepared by addition of 10 mol / l NaOH solution. In spite of the high cost, a certain amount of sodium carbonate was added into wastewater in order to strengthen buffer capacity."
3,Inoculum,"2.2 Inoculum Both bacterial culture and growth medium were identical to those used in the previous studies [21,22]. The facultative anaerobic organisms (predominantly Clostridium pasteurianum) under anaerobic conditions were inoculated into a 1.5 l completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR), followed by the growth in fed-batch culture for about 1month. The resultant culture was subsequently acclimated to enrichment cultures in non-sterile 2 m 3 tanks containing the mixture of raw citric acid wastewater and some nitrogen sources in anaerobic conditions. After an additional month's growth, this facultative anaerobic enrichment cultures could be used to treat wastewater, and was finally poured into UASB reactor."
4,UASB reactor,"2.3 UASB reactor The experiment was conducted in an improved UASB reactor made of carbon steel. Its working volume was 50 m 3 with a height of 6m. In order to ensure complete mixing of the organic wastewater and bacteria, the reactor was equipped with not only distributed inflow but also stirrer. Three liquid sampling ports were evenly installed among the height of the column (1.3, 2.6, and 3.9m, respectively). The upper part of the reactor was a gas–liquid–solid separator. The whole reactor was wrapped with a thermal insulating layer. A schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1 . Gas production was measured with a volumetric gas flow meter (LUGB Yutao, China) and pH was controlled by pump (MDP-20R Boshan, China)."
5,Start-up and continuous operation,"2.4 Start-up and continuous operation The start-up and continuous operation were controlled under 35– 38 ∘ C and initial pH of 7.0 ± 0.2 . The start-up continued for about 20days. Influent velocity was increased stepwise from 2 to 8 m 3 till the reactor was full. Once all kinds of concentrations of VFAs maintained steady, the amount of fermentative gas was evolved, apparent hydrogen production occurred, and continuous operation started formally. Two series of experiments were conducted to investigate both effects of HRT and VLR on hydrogen production. In Series 1, the HRT was gradually decreased from 48 to 8h while wastewater concentration, initial pH, and temperature were maintained at about 18 kg COD / l , 7.0 ± 0.2 , and 35– 38 ∘ C , respectively. In Series II, the organic loading rate was increased stepwise from around 10.0 to 75.0 kg COD / m 3 d via adjusting both HRT and substrate concentration under the conditions of temperature 35– 38 ∘ C and influent pH of 7.0 ± 0.5 . HRT experiment consists of 6 runs. Each run lasted for about 10–15days. In volume loading rate (VLR) experiment, VLR was slightly changed once per 2–4days. When the reactor attained steady state, in which biogas and effluent compositions were stable, both COD removal efficiency and TSDE achieved better results, the next run began. Mixing by stirrer was controlled once per hour and for 20min each time."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods The composition of hydrogen was determined with a gas chromatograph (GC, Shimadzu 14B, Japan) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 2-m stainless column packed with TDX-01B (60/80 mesh). The operational temperatures of injector, column, and detector were 95, 80, and 100 ∘ C , respectively. Argon was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 30ml/min. The concentrations of VFAs were also determined using a gas chromatograph (GC, Shimadzu 14B) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). The temperatures of injection, column, and detector were 180, 150, and 180 ∘ C , respectively. The carrier gas was also argon at a flow rate of 35ml/min. COD was measured by the standard method [23]. The pH values were measured with a pH meter (PHS-3B Shanghai, China). The concentrations of total sugar were determined by the phenol-sulfuric acid method using anhydrous glucose as a standard. The TKN was determined by standard methods with an apparatus (KDN-D8A, Changchun, China)."
7,Results and discussions,
8,Effect of HRT on COD removal efficiency and TSDE,"3.1 Effect of HRT on COD removal efficiency and TSDE Fig. 2 a illustrates the influence of HRT on the COD removal efficiency. The removal efficiency of COD changed slightly (above 60%) with HRT increasing from 12 to 48h. Generally, the COD removal efficiency over 60% satisfied needs in first stage of wastewater treatment. But when HRT was less than 12h, COD removal efficiency decreased remarkably. This change above might be due to the fact that a great mount of microbes were washed out of reactor when HRT was less than facultative bacteria generation time (8–12h). Fig. 2b shows the HRT-dependent profile of TSDE. TSDE gradually increased when HRT increased from 8 to 12h, and then decreased slightly when HRT was more than 12h. At HRT equal to 12h, the TSDE reached the maximum (i.e. 96.6%), which was also close to or over 90% during the experiment. The two results indicated that facultative bacteria used had higher efficiency in wastewater treatment."
9,Effect of HRT on evolved gas rate and gas content,"3.2 Effect of HRT on evolved gas rate and gas content Fig. 3 a shows the effect of HRT on total biogas production rate and hydrogen production rate (HPR). At higher or lower HRT, both total evolved biogas rate and hydrogen production rate were lower. The optimum biogas production rate of 1.95 m 3 / m 3 reactor d and the optimum HPR of 0.72 m 3 H 2 / m 3 reactor d were both obtained at 12h of HRT. Results illustrate that the anaerobic bacteria can degrade organic materials effectively in wastewater at shorter HRT. While the HRT was less than 12h, both parameters declined rapidly. The reason for such rapid drop might be that a large number of bacteria were washed out of the reactor and pH value decrease due to an increase in VFAs. Meanwhile, biogas only consists of H2 and CO2, and the content changes of H2 and CO2 at different HRTs are illustrated in Fig. 3b. CH4 and H2S were not found in this study, suggesting that the facultative microbial flora were competitive and reactor inside was in the absence of methanogenic bacteria and sulphate-reducing organism during the experiment. Since generation time of facultative anaerobic bacteria used was far less than that of methanogenic bacteria, short HRT suppresses methanogenic bacteria, which maybe also had effect on the balance between H2-producing bacteria and others in the mixed culture."
10,Effect of HRT on H2 recovery fraction and the soluble metabolites,"3.3 Effect of HRT on H2 recovery fraction and the soluble metabolites Aside from hydrogen and carbon dioxide, the major soluble metabolites produced in this study were VFAs, including acetic acid (HAc), butyric acid (HBu), and propionic acid (HPr). VFAs were useful indicators for monitoring hydrogen production. Fig. 4 a summarizes the effect of HRT on typical VFAs. From Fig. 4a it can be noticed that the distributions and fractions of VFAs vary markedly with an increase in HRT. The amount of HPr produced increased from 676 to 1096 mg / l with the increase of HRT and decreased to 876 mg / l when HRT was beyond 36h. The amount of HAc, however, decreased from 895 to 416 mg / l during the experiment. The amount of HBu changed remarkably. An initial increase occurred from 1089 mg / l to the maximum ( 3002 mg / l ) , followed by a rapid decrease from the maximum value to 2340 mg / l . But the amount of HBu was always the highest among three kinds of acids. The results show that HBu is the major soluble product for the system. At the same time, the remarkable variation in production fractions may indicate that the metabolism route, in which butyrate is converted to acetate, is dominant. But it has already been reported that the high presence of some VFAs concentrations might result in the production of alcohols [24,25]. In this study, small amounts of alcohols actually existed throughout the experiment and their concentrations decreased gradually with HRT increasing (concrete data not shown here). It may indicate that other routes still exist in the system, and that these route switches may be an adaptive response of the microbe to the lower pH environment [26]. A plot of the H2 recovery fraction versus HRT is shown in Fig. 4b. The optimum recovery fraction range of H2 (16.7–17.1%) appeared in the range of HRT 12–36h. These results agreed well with above conclusions in Fig. 2. High recovery fraction of H2 corresponded well with high hydrogen production rate, TSDE, and COD removal efficiency at 12h of HRT. At 12h of HRT, the optimized HPR was 0.72 m 3 H 2 / m 3 reactor d , and the TSDE was 96.6%, and the COD removal efficiency reached 61.4%. In the case of the UASB reactor used, these results suggest that the optimum HRT value is 12h, which could not only satisfy the need in bacterial metabolism, but also ensure continuous hydrogen production."
11,Effect of VLR on the bio-hydrogen production and pH,"In the citric acid-producing plant, the alternating use of pachyrhizus or cassava as raw materials remarkably lead to the variation in characteristics of wastewater and thus no corresponding linear relationship between HRT and VLR existed. In order to find the optimum value of VLR, the effect of VLR on the hydrogen yield was also investigated. The variation in both H2 yield and the hydrogen production with VLR is shown in Fig. 5 a. There was a similarity between both curves, firstly increased when VLR varied from about 10.0 to 38.4 kg COD / m 3 d , and then decreased as VLR was over 38.4 kg COD / m 3 d . The optimized value nearly appeared at the same positions. When VLR was 38.4 kg COD / m 3 d , the optimized hydrogen production and the optimized H2 yield were 34.4 m 3 / d and 0.84 mol H 2 / mol hexose consumed, respectively. Apparently, the VLR of 38.4 kg COD / m 3 d was optimum for treating this kind of citric wastewater. Low pH environment always causes a failure of bacteria propagation. Fig. 5b examines the influence of VLR on system pH (effluent pH) as influent pH is controlled at 7 ± 0.5 . As shown in Fig. 5b, the effluent pH first almost maintained at the same level (5.2–5.3) when VLR increased from 10.0 to 36.2 kg COD / m 3 d , the decrease in pH values from about 5.2 to 4.5 subsequently happened as VLR was over 36.2 kg COD / m 3 d . The experimental results indicate that accumulated VFAs may be mainly responsible for this decline."
12,Operation analyses,"COD removal efficiency and TSDE are two important parameters for evaluating operation stability. In Fig. 5c, TSDE and COD removal efficiency vary with an increase in VLR. When the VLR was from 20.0– 48.0 kg COD / m 3 d , the COD removal rate was over 60% all the time, even up to 72.4% at the VLR of 34.5 kg COD / m 3 d . TSDE was close to or over 90% as VLR existed in the range of 10– 60 kg COD / m 3 d , even up to 94.4% at a 38.4 kg COD / m 3 d of VLR. All experimental results demonstrate that the whole set of UASB reactor used in this study is highly efficient for hydrogen production and excellent system stabilization."
13,Conclusions,"In the 50 m 3 UASB reactor, the facultative anaerobic bacteria was used to continuously produce hydrogen using the citric acid industrial wastewater as single carbon source. Biogas was composed of hydrogen and carbon dioxide without detectable methane. As the wastewater contains lower BOD concentration (about 8000 mg / l ), the optimized continuous H2 yield of 0.72 m 3 / m 3 reactor d , and the maximum volumetric production rate of 0.84molH2/molhexose removed were still obtained, at HRT of 12h and VLR of 38.4 kg COD / m 3 d . Due to higher biogas yield and operation as low as 12h of HRT, the UASB reactor seemed to be a better choice for continuous hydrogen fermentation and wastewater reduction. Furthermore, COD removal efficiency mostly exceeded 60% and TSDE was almost over 90% during the experiment. The obtained results provided useful data for biological hydrogen production on a large scale."
