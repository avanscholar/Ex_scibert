0,Introduction,"In recent years, hydrogen evolution via water splitting through photo−/electrochemical catalysis has gained much attention in scientific research worldwide because of energy crisis. Storing solar energy in the form of hydrogen is touted as the energy currency of the future and a simple and promising method for hydrogen production is electrolysis of water [1,2]. The cathodic half reaction of the water splitting reaction is hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the reaction equation in the acid solution is as follows [3]: 2 H 3 O + + 2 e − ↔ H 2 + H 2 O Highly active and stable electrocatalyst is crucial for efficient electrocatalysis of HER to produce hydrogen at low-cost. It is commonly accepted that noble metal platinum (Pt) or Pt based catalysts are the most efficient catalysts. However, its expensive cost and scarcity hindered its large-scale application. Considerable efforts have been made in the past years to develop certain inexpensive and efficient catalysts as substitutes for Pt based materials for HER, such as transitional metal chalcogenides [4], phosphides [5], carbides [6,7], and oxides [8]. Some materials exhibited fantabulous HER catalytic properties through modifying such as introducing carbon as catalyst support even if they are not excellent in nature [2,5,9]. Ternary oxides of germanates have drawn great attention in many fields, such as electrochemical sensors [10], optics [11], electrocatalysts [12] and lithium-ion batteries [13,14]. CuGeO3 is the first inorganic solid material which is found to undergo a spin-Peierls transition and it is the only compound having GeO4 tetrahedra lie on one side of the chain among all the ABO3 compounds with pyroxene structure [15]. Due to its unique structural properties, CuGeO3 has been studied as anode materials for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries [16,17] and electrode for the electrochemical detection [10,18–20]. However, as far as we know, it has not been used as a catalyst for HER. In this paper, CuGeO3 was synthesized with different morphology compared with reported nanowires or nanoflowers [18,19,21], using a simple one-step hydrothermal method with the assistance of ethylenediamine. The standard broom-like CuGeO3 exhibits more excellent electrocatalytic activity with low overpotential and good stability."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of the catalysts,"2.1 Synthesis of the catalysts The synthesis of CuGeO3 was carried out by a mild hydrothermal process assisted by En. All chemical reagents were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification. Firstly, 0.2123 g CuCl2·2H2O was added to 40 mL of deionized water. 0.1255 g GeO2 was mixed with 5 mL of aqueous NaOH (4 g/L) under vigorous stirring until it was completely dissolved. Then the two solutions above-mentioned were mixed and the mixed solution was adjusted to a certain pH value of 2.5 with aqueous HCl (0.2 mol/L). Finally, 100 μL En was added drop by drop into the mixed solution slowly to form a homogeneous solution. The mixed solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave maintained at 180 °C for 3–16 h. After reaction, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally. The products were washed with deionized water and alcohol repeatedly to remove inorganic and organic residues and dried at 60 °C in ambient air."
3,Materials characterization,2.2 Materials characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were taken with XRD-6100 equipped with a graphite monochromatized Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained with JSM-6610 SEM (20 kV). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were carried out with JEM-2100 TEM with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were recorded on ESCALAB 250Xi system to study the chemical composition of the catalysts with an Al Kα radiation.
4,Electrochemical measurements,"2.3 Electrochemical measurements All electrochemical tests were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI760E, Chenhua, shanghai) at room temperature in a standard three electrode cell. The 0.5 M H2SO4 solution was used as electrolyte, a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode and a platinum wire were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. For the working electrode preparation: 5 mg catalyst was dispersed into 1 mL distilled water under ultrasonic stirring for 30 min. Then about 18 μL of the homogeneous mixture was dropped on the surface of the glassy carbon electrode (5 mm). 3 μL Na+-exchanged Nafion® solution was added on the as-prepared catalyst film which was dried at room temperature overnight. All the potentials obtained from linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) were converted to values with the reference of a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the following equation [9,22]: E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.197 + 0.0591pH Prior to measurements, the electrolyte was thoroughly gotten rid of air by purging it with N2 for 30 min. The LSV curve was conducted within the range of −0.2 ~ −0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl (scan rate: 5 mV/s) and the Tafel plot was generated by an additional LSV test which was performed at a lower scan rate of 1 mV/s. Electrochemical double-layer capacitance of the catalysts was derived from CV diagrams under different scan rates of 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 mV/s. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out with the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz of an amplitude 10 mV under −0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Structure and morphology characterization,"3.1 Structure and morphology characterization The phase and the chemical composition of the as-prepared sample were investigated by XRD and XPS. From Fig. 1a, all the diffraction peaks can be indexed to pure orthorhombic phase CuGeO3 (JCPDS card no 32–0333) with calculated lattice constants of a = 0.4802 nm and c = 0.2943 nm. The strong and high-pitched diffraction peaks show good crystallinity of the product. No other impurity peaks were detected. Fig. S1a, b and c are the higher resolution XPS of Cu2p, Ge2p and O1s, respectively. All XPS spectra were calibrated by using C1s peak at binding energy of 284.6 eV from absorbed carbon-containing organic pollutants. The two strong peaks in the Cu2p spectrum at 935.4 eV and 955.6 eV are assigned to the Cu2p3/2 and Cu2p1/2 (Fig. S1a) [23] and the peaks at 943.0 eV and 963.2 eV are the typical shake-up of Cu2+ [20]. The presence of a shake-up satellite in the Cu2p spectra confirm the existence of Cu2+ state, which is apparently different from that of Cu+ and Cu0. Ge2p spectrum of the sample is displayed in Fig. S1b. The peaks at 1251.7 eV and 1220.7 eV can be assigned to the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 of Ge4+ according to the XPS handbook [24]. A strong O1s peak centered at 531.3 eV is assigned to oxygen in its O2− oxidation state (Fig. S1c) [19]. Based on the above experimental XRD and XPS data, we confirm that the sample is composed of pure orthorhombic phase CuGeO3. The microstructure and morphology of the electrocatalyst were analyzed by SEM and TEM. As shown in Fig. 1b-d, the SEM and TEM images distinctly appear the broom-like morphology of CuGeO3. The SEM image in Fig. 1b shows each CuGeO3 micro-nanostructure has the typical length in the range of 20–50 μm and the diameter in the range of 3–4 μm. Remarkably, the end of the CuGeO3 microstructure is bifurcated into finer nanowires with the average diameter of about 150 nm, as indicated by the white arrow in Fig. 1b and TEM image (Fig. 1c). High resolution-TEM image in Fig. 1d confirmed that these nanowires are crystalline."
7,HER performance of the broom-like CuGeO3 catalyst,"3.2 HER performance of the broom-like CuGeO3 catalyst The CuGeO3 samples with different morphologies are prepared by controlling the reaction time and denoted as A1-3h, A2-5h, A3-7h, A4-9h, A5-12h, A6-16h, for reaction time of 3 h, 5 h, 7 h, 9 h, 12 h, 16 h, respectively (Fig. S3). The XRD patterns confirm that pure orthorhombic phase CuGeO3 was synthesized in three hours and no other impurities form with the increase of time (Fig. S2). The HER measurement was carried out in 0.5 M H2SO4 (pH = 0.3) using a standard three-electrode configuration. Choose A2-5h represents microstructure, A3-7h represents standard broom-like micro-nanostructure, A6-16h represents nanostructure for comparison. In Fig. 2a, after thousands LSVs under the same condition for activation, the HER overpotentials of A3-7h is 135 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is lower than those of A2-5h (338 mV) and A6-16h (227 mV), suggesting the excellent electrocatalytic activity among the as-investigated samples. Tafel plots were then employed to investigate the HER kinetic of these samples. As we all know, the HER proceeds in the sequence of three principal reaction steps in acidic solution as shown in following equations: H 3 O + + e − → H ads + H 2 O H ads + H 3 O + + e − → H 2 + H 2 O H ads + H ads → H 2 The corresponding Tafel slopes are 120, 40 and 30 mV dec−1, respectively [3,25]. In Fig. S4, different Tafel slopes of 179, 98 and 132 mV dec−1 were obtained for A2-5h, A3-7h and A6-16h, respectively, indicating that the HER kinetic of these samples follows the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism [26,27]. And all the slopes are close to 120 mV dec−1, suggesting the rate-limiting step is the electron transfer step, in other words, the step of the proton gains electrons to form an absorbed state of hydrogen atom (Hads) on the surface of the electrode. EIS of the as-prepared samples was carried out to study the electrode kinetics of HER at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte. As the Nyquist plots shown in Fig. 2b, all the samples present the same ohmic drop in the high-frequency zone and the obtained semicircles of EIS indicated that change transfer resistance (RCT). The smaller semicircle, the faster electron transport for hydrogen evolution [28,29]. Rct value of A3-7h (~17.5 Ω) is much lower than those of A6-16h (~110 Ω) and A2-5h (~170 Ω), implying the fast HER kinetics. A6-16h is lower than that of A2-5h because of the effect of size, which demonstrate clearly nanostructure exposed more active sites than microstructure. Compared with A2-5h and A6-16h, the unique architecture of A3-7h can effectively prevent the stacking and aggregation of CuGeO3 during the catalytic process, which is beneficial to expose more edge sites. To further verify the supposal, the double-layer capacitances (Cdl) was also measured to evaluate the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). The Cdl value of the samples were the linear slope by plotting the current density variation △j (janodic - jcathodic) at 0.39 V vs. RHE against the scan rate, which were derived from cyclic voltammetry diagrams (Fig. S5) [30,31]. As shown in Fig. S5d, the Cdl of A3-7h (170 μF cm−2) is higher than A2-5h (97 μF cm−2) and A6-16h (93 μF cm−2), suggesting A3-7h has more accessible active sites than others. The long-time durability of broom-like CuGeO3 was performed by repeating LSV loops and the current density value under the potential of 260 mV vs. RHE, as plotted against the time in Fig. S6a. The standard broom-like samples exhibit the good stability which could be maintained for over 80 h. Combining the SEM images above (Fig. S3), the samples with standard broom-like micro-nanostructure show a better catalytic activity. We speculate that the micro-nanostructure is more conductive to exposing more active sites as shown in Fig. S6b - d. From the morphology of A2-5h, it can be seen that the low bifurcation degree leads to the micro-part in the majority. When the sample is dripped onto the electrode surface, it tends to form the stacked structure (Fig. S6b). Similarly, A6-16h, the nano-part is in the majority, also exhibits this structure (Fig. S6d). However, for the standard micro-nanostructure, the forked structures at the front end intersect and support each other to form a network like structure (Fig. S6c) which can expose more active sites. Nyquist plots and Cdl values verify the speculation to a certain extent. The broom-like CuGeO3 demonstrate good electrocatalytic activity, as comparated with some of the reported electrocatalysts in the acidic solution (Table. 1 ). The research of a robust catalytic system based on ternary metal oxides electrocatalyst for HER remains a deficiency. In this paper, the results of the broom-like CuGeO3 demonstrate good electrocatalytic activity, as compared with some of the reported electrocatalysts in the acidic solution (Table. 1). Compared to the overpotential of bare MoP (150 mV at 10 mA cm−2) which has been intensively examined as potential HER electrocatalyst, the bare broom-like CuGeO3 has a lower overpotential (135 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and we believe it is worthy of further studying as potential HER electrocatalyst, such as importing the carbon layer as the support material to improve the conductivity."
8,Conclusion,"In summary, unique broom-like CuGeO3 micro-nanostructures were fabricated by a facile hydrothermal method in a short time. Our XRD, TEM and XPS results confirmed the broom-like micro-nanostructure is pure orthorhombic phase. The typical broom-like structure exposes more active sites on the surface of electrode and exhibits the best overpotential of 135 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 compared to the as-investigated samples. The stability test shows the good catalytic activity over 80 h. This study showed CuGeO3 can act as electrocatalyst for the HER and has great potential and new possibilities for electrocatalytic application."
