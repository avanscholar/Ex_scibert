0,Introduction,"Being a non-precious and environmentally friendly metal, bismuth has attracted increasing interest as a suitable alternative to replace more expensive, corrosive, and toxic industrial catalysts. Bismuth has been proposed as catalyst for several chemical transformations either in the form of salts or organometallic compounds [1]. Furthermore, similarly to other p-electron metals (e.g. Pb, Sn, Sb), when added in low concentration, bismuth has demonstrated to act as promoter and/or modifier of noble metal catalysts [2]. The modification with Bi has been reported to affect the catalytic performances of Pd-, Pt- and Au-based catalysts in several reactions, such as the selective oxidation of biomass derived substrates (e.g. alcohols [2–6], glycerol [7,8], glucose [9], 5-hydroxymethylfurfural [10], glyoxal [11]), the hydrochlorination of acetylene [12], the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) [13], hydrogenation reactions [14], the electrooxidation of formic acid [15] or NaBH4 [16] for hydrogen production, and many others. Trimetallic Au-Pd-Bi catalysts have been already demonstrated to exhibit unique selectivity and stability in alcohol oxidation processes. Although numerous studies appeared investigating the nature of the promoter role of Bi by advanced ex situ and in situ characterization techniques [6,17–20], this subject still remains a matter of debate. Various interpretations have been proposed for the promotional effects; for example including (i) the geometric blocking of low-selectivity sites (edges, corners, terraces) on the noble metal nanoparticles, (ii) modification of the electronic properties of the vicinal noble metal atoms and the subsequent effects on adsorption properties, (iii) the stabilization of metal phases, and (iv) the ligand effects by the formation of complexes among bismuth and noble metal atoms and the adsorbed reactants/products. Further complicating matters, the nature and the role of bismuth strongly depends on the experimental procedure followed for its deposition on the catalyst surface. Depending on the synthesis conditions, different location and speciation of Bi can be obtained, alternatively resulting either in the formation of a trimetallic ensemble or more segregated systems [21,22]. In this work, we have investigated the role of Bi as modifier of bimetallic well-defined AuPd nanoparticles supported on carbon, when used as catalysts for oxidation and hydrogenation reactions. Cinnamyl alcohol and cinnamaldehyde were selected as model substrates due to the fact we can study the preferential oxidation of the C-OH, CO, and preferential reduction of CC, CO functional groups. According to Scheme S1, the cinnamyl alcohol oxidation can proceed through a complex pathway leading to a large variety of products. The dehydrogenation of the hydroxyl group produces cinnamaldehyde, an interesting product with application in food industry as flavoring, in agrochemistry as insecticide and in metallurgy as corrosion inhibitor. Cinnamyl alcohol can also undergo hydrogenolysis resulting in the production of trans-1-phenyl-1-propene or hydrogenation of the carbon–carbon double bond to form 3-phenyl-1-propanol. Both trans-1-phenyl-1-propene and 3-phenyl-1-propanol can be further transformed into 1-phenylpropane, used as solvent in printing ink industry and textile industry. Although the occurrence of hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation reaction might sound implausible in oxidative conditions, it finds adequate explanation in the reaction mechanism, involving formation of metal-hydride species [23,24]. The latter can then transfer hydrogen to the adsorbed reagent or product molecules. Indeed, also cinnamaldehyde can be hydrogenated to 3-phenylpropanal. In addition, cinnamaldehyde can be decarbonylated to CO and styrene, while carbon‑carbon bond cleavage leads to benzaldehyde. Similarly to cinnamyl alcohol oxidation reaction, the presence of many functional groups in the substrate is responsible for the complex reaction pathway of the cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation reaction (Scheme S2). The hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde can involve either the alkenyl group or the carbonyl group. In the former case 3-phenylpropanal, a compound widely used as artificial flavoring additive in food and cosmetics, is produced. The selective hydrogenation of carbonyl group leads to cinnamyl alcohol, which can undergo hydrogenolysis to trans-1-phenyl-1-propene. The hydrogenation of both carbonyl and alkenyl group results in the formation of 3-phenyl-1-propanol. Both trans-1-phenyl-1-propene and 3-phenyl-1-propanol can be converted into 1-phenylpropane. Herein, the comparison between two different Bi deposition experimental procedures as well as the use of a combination of several characterization techniques (transmission electron microscopy, X-rays absorption spectroscopy) help in determining the structure-activity relationships of trimetallic Au-Pd-Bi catalysts with respect to analogue AuPd catalysts."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation 2.1.1 Monometallic Pd/AC preparation Solid Na2PdCl4 (0.051 mmol) (Sigma-Aldrich, purity >99.9%) and 1 mL of a PVA solution (1 wt%) were mixed in 0.1 L of H2O (Pd:PVA 1/0.5 wt/wt%), forming a yellow solution. After 3 min, a precise volume of 0.1 M of NaBH4 solution (Pd/NaBH4 1/8 mol/mol) was added in the solution under magnetic stirring and a colloid was produced. Within a few minutes of colloid generation the pH was regulated to the value of 2 by addition of sulphuric acid and the support was added to the vigorously stirring colloidal solution. The amount of the support was accurately weighed in order to obtain a final metal loading of 1 wt% (in the assumption of quantitative loading of the metal on the support). The catalysts were filtered and washed several times and dried at 100 °C for 2 h. 2.1.2 Bimetallic AuPd/AC preparation Solid NaAuCl4. 2H2O (0.062 mmol) and Na2PdCl4 (0.040 mmol) (Au/Pd ratio 0.73/0.27 wt%) and 2 mL of a PVA solution (1 wt%) were mixed in 0.2 L of H2O (Au/PVA 1/0.5 wt/wt%). After 3 min, a 0.1 M of NaBH4 solution (Au/NaBH4 1/4 mol/mol) was added to the solution under vigorous magnetic stirring. Within a few minutes of their generation, the colloids (after pH regulation to pH = 2, by sulphuric acid) were immobilized by dispersing the support in the vigorously stirring colloidal solution. The amount of the support was controlled in order to obtain a final metal loading of 1 wt% (on the basis of quantitative loading of the metal on the support). The catalysts were filtered and washed several times and dried at 100 °C for 2 h. 2.1.3 Trimetallic AuPdBi/AC and physical mixture preparation Bismuth was added to a portion of AuPd/AC prepared with the methodology reported above. BiO(NO)3 (0.12 mmol) was dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water at pH = 2 (pH modified using concentrated H2SO4). Bi amount was calculated in order to have a final loading of 1%. AuPd/AC was added to the solution and left under stirring for 2 h. The solid was re-dispersed in 100 mL of distilled water and a 0.1 M fresh solution of NaBH4 (metal/NaBH4 = 1:1 mol/mol) was added under stirring. The catalyst was filtered, thoroughly washed with distilled water and dried at 100 °C for 2 h. For physical mixture preparation, solid Bi2O3 and AuPd/AC were physically mixed before adding to the reactor. The amount of Bi2O3 was calculated in order to have the same Bi loading as in the previous catalyst 1%Bi."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization 2.2.1 Electron microscopies STEM/EDX measurements were performed on a FEI Talos 200× scanning transmission electron microscope equipped with a Super-X energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer at the University of Manchester. AuPd/C particles were dry dispersed on lacey-C Cu grids with high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging and EDS mapping performed with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. L-family X-rays were used for generation of Au and Pd background subtracted X-ray intensity maps. SEM measurements were performed on a TESCAN MAIA 3 field emission gun scanning electron microscope operating at 15 Kv. EDX maps were acquired on an Oxford Instruments X-MAXN 80 detector. 2.2.2 X-ray absorption spectroscopy X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements were carried out on the B18 beamline, Diamond Light Source, UK. All measurements were carried out in fluorescence mode using a 9-element solid state Ge detector. A Si (111) double crystal monochromator (DCM) was used for measurements of the L-edges of Au and Bi, with a Si (311) DCM was used for the Pd K-edge. Each scan was ~30 min, with a minimum of 3 scans required to achieve an appropriate signal-to-noise ratio. The merged spectra were analysed using Athena and Artemis from the Demeter IFEFFIT package [25,26]."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests 2.3.1 Cinnamyl alcohol oxidation The reactions were carried out in a thermostat controlled stainless steel reactor (30 mL) agitated with an electronically controlled magnetic stirrer connected to a large reservoir (5000 mL) containing oxygen at 2 atm. The oxygen uptake was followed by a mass flow controller connected to a PC through an A/D board. The oxidation experiments were carried out in xylene (0.3 M substrate, substrate/Pd = 1000 (mol/mol), 80 °C, pO2 = 2 atm). The reaction was monitored by analysing periodically withdrawn samples. Mass balances, in the analysis, were always 98% ± 3.

5,Results and discussion,"1 wt% AuPd/AC catalyst (Au:Pd molar ratio 6:4) was prepared by an established two step procedure, able to produce alloyed structures as we have shown in previous publications [27,28]. The bimetallic catalyst has been modified by subsequent Bi deposition to prepare a trimetallic AuPdBi/AC catalyst (1 wt% Bi loading). The bimetallic and trimetallic catalysts were tested in both oxidation and hydrogenation model reactions. The comparison with monometallic Pd/AC catalyst allowed to reveal the synergistic effects deriving from the addition of Au and Bi in bimetallic and trimetallic catalysts, respectively. Cinnamyl alcohol was selected as a model substrate to evaluate the catalytic performances of as prepared materials in liquid phase oxidation processes, using xylene as solvent. The main results are summarized in Table 1 . The oxidation of cinnamyl alcohol on Pd/AC catalyst produced cinnamaldehyde (69% selectivity at 90% conversion) and a large amount of 3-phenylpropanol (27%) as by-product deriving from the hydrogenation of the CC bond. As reported above, according to the literature the hydrogenation of the double bond is promoted by the formation of PdH species during the dehydrogenation process [29]. Although metal hydride species should be expected to react with oxygen to form water or hydrogen peroxide, actually substrate and product molecules can compete with oxygen for these species. The occurrence of hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions even under aerobic conditions has been reported by Keresszegi et al. [30], which observed the formation of products from hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reaction over Pd/Al2O3 even in the presence of molecular oxygen, which is more likely responsible for oxidative removal of degradation products. In situ XAFS studies by Lee et al. demonstrated that oxygen has an active role in minimizing the adsorbate-induced catalyst reduction and restructuring phenomena on Pd/C catalyst, by restoring surface PdOx species which are responsible for high activity and selectivity in cinnamyl alcohol oxidation [31]. More recently, Rucinska et al. investigated the role of oxygen in the cinnamyl alcohol oxidation over 1%AuPd/TiO2 catalysts under experimental conditions (solvent: toluene, pO2 = 3 bar and T = 120 °C) close to those used in this work [32]. A higher selectivity to cinnamaldehyde was attained under aerobic conditions compared to unaerobic conditions (3 bar N2), however also in this case hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis products were formed and accounted for ca. 15%, in agreement to the results reported in Table 2 . Alloying Au to Pd resulted in a catalyst 1.5 times more active than monometallic Pd (253 h−1 vs. 402 h−1 TOF for Pd and AuPd, respectively) and limited the hydrogenation of the CC bond compared to Pd (27% vs. 2% selectivity to 3-phenylpropanol, and 69% vs. 80% selectivity to cinnamaldehyde on Pd and AuPd, respectively). In addition, the 3-phenylpropanol produced in more modest amount, was further oxidized to the corresponding aldehyde (3-phenylpropanal). These results suggested that i) the addition of Au prevented the formation of PdH species, as reported in the literature [33,34], thus limiting the hydrogenation of the CC bond; ii) Pd is less prone to oxidize non activated –OH group than AuPd. This evidence was further corroborated by a further experiment consisting in 3-phenyl propanol oxidation (as an intermediate of cinnamyl alcohol oxidation), which confirmed the observed catalytic trend, being Pd about 7.5 times less active (TOF 10 h−1) than AuPd (TOF 75 h−1) in the specific reaction (Table 2). When trimetallic AuPdBi catalyst was tested in cinnamyl alcohol oxidation, the catalytic activity was increased by a factor of 1.25 compared to Pd catalyst, even if ca. 20% decrease in activity (315 h−1) was observed compared to bimetallic AuPd catalyst (402 h−1). Interestingly, for the trimetallic catalysts, the oxidation of cinnamyl alcohol proceeded with a very high selectivity to cinnamaldehyde (90%). This experimental evidence suggested that Bi significantly suppresses the CC hydrogenation process in agreement with current literature [14]. Phenylpropanal and phenylpropanol were present just as traces, the former deriving from the oxidation of the latter, as confirmed by 3-phenyl propanol oxidation tests (Table 2). To better understand the effect of Bi in the hydrogenation activity of catalysts, interesting considerations could be drawn from the evaluation of the catalytic performances in cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation reaction in terms of reduction of the CC or CO functional group (Table 3 ). Comparing Pd, AuPd and AuPdBi, in terms of activity the same trend was observed as in the case of the oxidation reaction. Alloying Au to Pd led to a higher catalytic activity by a factor of 1.12 than monometallic Pd (1425 and 1274 h−1 for AuPd and Pd respectively) whereas the addition of Bi slightly decreased the activity (1209 h−1). However, the differences in the activity were not as remarkable as in the case of oxidation reaction. More interestingly, concerning the selectivity, the addition of Bi enhanced the selectivity to 3-phenylpropanal (from 70% with AuPd to 93% in the case of AuPdBi), i.e. the CC hydrogenation product, while it inhibited the formation of 3-phenylpropanol, which was present in discrete amount in the case of Pd and AuPd catalysts and could derive from the further hydrogenation of 3-phenylpropanal or from cinnamyl alcohol hydrogenation pathway. In order to understand the catalytic role of bismuth in relation with its insertion in the preformed AuPd structure, morphological and structural characterization of bimetallic and trimetallic catalysts was performed. Particle size distributions from TEM analyses (Fig. S1) demonstrated that both monometallic (Pd/AC), bimetallic (AuPd/AC) had similar mean particle sizes (3.2–3.9 nm), as typically observed in catalysts prepared by this specific sol-immobilisation procedure. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) coupled with elemental mapping by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy confirmed the presence of random-alloyed structure of bimetallic AuPd nanoparticles in AuPd/AC catalyst (Fig. 1 ). X-ray absorption spectra (EXAFS) at the Pd K-edge and Au L3-edge (Fig. S2) and values of coordination numbers (N), nearest-neighbours distances (R) and Debye-Waller factors (σ2) reported in Table 4 confirmed the formation of an AuPd alloy. Actually, the presence of AuPd bonds was clearly observed and PdPd and AuAu distances were comparable to the PdAu (Tables 4). The alloyed structure of AuPd was maintained also in the trimetallic catalysts, while concerning bismuth EXAFS data analysis indicates the presence of only a BiO and a BiBi coordination. It seems, then, that Bi is not alloyed with Au and Pd rather it is present as a segregated bismuth oxide phase. Even if an alloyed structure between Au, Pd and and Bi cannot be supposed on the basis of EXAFS, we might guess that the bismuth oxide phase is in the close proximity of AuPd NPs. In fact, SEM-EDX analysis revealed the co-presence of trimetallic systems with homogeneous Au, Pd, Bi distribution in close contact with a segregated bismuth phase as is shown in Fig. 2 . In any case, the occurrence of moderate segregation did not alter the mean particle size (Fig. S1). The modification of activity and selectivity observed for trimetallic AuPdBi catalysts could be ascribed to the presence of bismuth oxide phase highly dispersed and in intimate contact with Au and Pd sites. Indeed, when a physical mixture of Bi2O3 mixed to the bimetallic AuPd/AC catalyst is tested both for the model oxidation and hydrogenation reactions (Tables 1, 2 and 3, entry 4). No significant differences in activity and selectivity were observed compared to AuPd/AC, thus suggesting that when introduced as physical mixture bismuth oxide acts as spectator species. We propose that the deposition of highly dispersed bismuth phase provokes a partial blockage of a fraction of active sites, which could be likely responsible for both selectivity enhancement and slight activity drop. However, we cannot exclude that the interaction of bismuth with AuPd might also cause a modification of the electron density on the metal sites (e.g. charge transfer effects)."
6,Conclusions,"Investigations on trimetallic AuPdBi/AC catalysts revealed that bismuth slightly depresses the activity of AuPd alloyed NPs and modifies the selectivity in both oxidation and hydrogenation reactions in agreement with previous reports. Structural, compositional and morphological characterization revealed the co-presence of segregated bismuth oxide and trimetallic AuPdBi nanoparticles. This outcome suggests that Bi basically acts as a “physical” blocker for the most active sites on AuPd NPs, limiting the occurrence of consecutive reactions. The addition of low amount of bismuth (1 wt%) to AuPd NPs thus appears as a good compromise to achieve a significative enhancement of selectivity with negligible decrease in the activity. Further experimental (e.g. CO chemisorption) and theoretical studies are still needed, aimed to identify the nature of blocked active sites on AuPd NPs (e.g. atoms at corners, edges, low-coordination sites) and their interactions with bismuth phase. The effect of the synthesis conditions, and in particular the role of stabilizing agent (PVA) in controlling the dispersion and sitting of Bi phase, are additional aspects which deserve to be investigated in more detail."
