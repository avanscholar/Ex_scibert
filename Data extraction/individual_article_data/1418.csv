0,Introduction,"Ever increasing global energy demand and depletion of fossil fuel resources and environmental concerns, particularly greenhouse gas emissions have motivated researchers to look for alternative energy resources. Microalgae are one of the most promising types of biomass due to their higher photosynthesis efficiency, simple cell structure, lowest sulphur content, and high CO2 capture capacity (Milano et al., 2016). In addition, the high-protein nature of microalgae makes it very suitable for production of various high-value nitrogen-containing fine chemicals (Huang et al., 2017; Maliutina et al., 2017). Hydrogen is one of the most promising fuels with a very high energy density and numerous environmental and socio-economic advantages over fossil fuels (Kırtay, 2011; Sharma and Arya, 2017). Hydrogen is a clean source of energy as it does not form CO2 when used in hydrogen fuel cells and the only by-product of its combustion is water (Azwar et al., 2014). Hydrogen is mainly produced by thermochemical conversion of fossil fuels such as natural gas, naphtha, heavy oils, and coal (Kırtay, 2011). Hydrogen is mainly used for production of fertilisers and petroleum refining (Konieczny et al., 2008), and can also be used for power generation or fuelling vehicles. Microalgae are promising sources for sustainable production of hydrogen, which can decrease the net CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. However, the hydrogen production technologies from microalgae require further development to increase its competitiveness. One way to achieve this is development of a poly-generation approach for production of several value-added products. Pyrolysis of microalgae for co-production of hydrogen, nitrogen containing compounds, and bio-char may increase its competitiveness in energy market. The conversion of microalgae into biofuels has been realized via thermochemical and biochemical conversion. However, the high cost and low efficiency of microalgae to biofuels techniques hinders the competitiveness of the biofuel produced from these methods with fossil fuels. An alternative approach is the production of value-added products from microalgae via pyrolysis. Pyrolysis of microalgae for co-production of bio-oil, bio-gas, and bio-char has been reported in the literature. Miao et al. (2004) carried out fast pyrolysis of two different types of microalgae in a fluidized-bed reactor with a short vapor residence time of 2–3 s. Bio-oil was characterized by low oxygen content with a higher heating value of 29 MJ/kg, making it suitable as a fuel. In our previous study (Maliutina et al., 2017) the fast pyrolysis behavior of Chlorella vulgaris was investigated in an entrained-flow reactor. It was found that increasing the temperature greatly affected the product yields and composition. High protein nature of microalgae led to formation of nitrogen-containing compounds such as indole, imidazole, and pyridine in bio-oil. In another study by the authors (Huang et al., 2017) catalytic microwave pyrolysis of Chlorella vulgaris and Spirulina sp. was investigated for formation of nitrogen-containing compounds. It was found that activated carbon promoted the formation of nitrogen-containing aliphatics, while the yield of nitrogen-containing aromatic compounds was promoted in presence of magnetite. The formation of nitrogen-containing species during pyrolysis was also reported by other researchers (Li et al., 2017; Maddi et al., 2011; Trinh et al., 2013). Reaction pressure may significantly affect the pyrolysis process in terms of product yield and composition. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), wire mesh reactor, fluidized-bed reactor, and entrained-flow systems have been used to investigate the influence of pressure on pyrolysis (Garcia-Nunez et al., 2017). Basile et al. (2014) investigated the effect of pressure on pyrolysis of biomass and reported that pyrolysis process may shift from endothermic (primary decomposition process, leading to the formation of volatiles) to exothermic (vapor-solid interactions, leading to secondary char formation) at higher pressures. Melligan et al. (2011) used a fixed-bad reactor for pyrolysis of Miscanthus under pressurized conditions. They observed that the surface area of char decreased significantly with increasing the pyrolysis pressure from atmospheric to 2.6 MPa. Wafiq et al. (2016) studied the pyrolysis of raw and torrefied Miscanthus in a drop tube reactor at 800 °C and pressures of 1–3 MPa. They reported that pressure significantly affected the yields of products, gas composition, and char structure for both raw and torrefied biomass. Ateş et al. (2015) investigated the influence of pressure on dried distillers grains with soluble and canola seed press cake in a fixed-bed reactor and observed that at elevated pressures the yield of non-condensable gases and chars increased, while a lower yield was obtained for pyrolysis liquids. Qian et al. (2014) carried out pressurized pyrolysis of rice husk using a fixed-bed reactor and reported that high pressure promoted the deoxygenation, dehydration, and decarboxylation of bio-oil, while the concentration of methane increased in bio-gas. Mahinpey et al. (2009) studied pressurized pyrolysis of wheat straw using a tubular reactor at temperature of 500 °C and obtained the highest bio-oil and syngas (CO and H2) yield at 40 psi and 20 psi, respectively. Large body of work has focused on pressurized pyrolysis of lignocellulosic and waste biomass and the impact of pressure on pyrolysis of microalgae is not fully understood. Furthermore, majority of pressurized pyrolysis experiments have been carried out using TGA, and small scale fixed-bed reactors, which suffer from low heating rates. The composition of microalgae pyrolysis products at atmospheric pressures is very complex, which makes them very difficult to separate and purify. Therefore, new technologies need to be developed to increase the selectivity of the value-added products during pyrolysis process of microalgae. Pressurized entrained-flow pyrolysis of microalgae is a promising method to increase the selectivity of value-added products under single-particle heating mode and fast heating rates similar to that of industrial reactors. The present study aims to establish the influence of pressure on the yields and composition of microalgae pyrolysis products during fast entrained-flow pyrolysis. Pressurized pyrolysis tests were carried out in temperature range of 600–900 °C and pressures of 0.1–4 MPa and the impact of pressure on bio-oil, bio-gas, and bio-char yields and composition was systematically studied using various analytical techniques."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Biomass characterization,"2.1 Biomass characterization Microalgae Chlorella vulgaris was supplied by Spirulina Bio-Engineering Co. Ltd., China with a particle size of <105 µm. Samples were dried at 105 °C for 24 h and stored in a desiccator to avoid the moisture reabsorption. The proximate analysis of microalgae were performed following ASTM standards of D3173 for the moisture, D3174 for the ash, and D3175 for the volatile matter, and the fixed carbon content was calculated by difference. The proximate analysis of microalgae was as follows: moisture (wt%, ar): 10.21; volatile matter (wt%, db): 80.41; ash (wt%, db): 5.54; and fixed carbon (wt%, db): 14.05%. The ultimate analysis of microalgae was carried out using a Euro Vector Euro EA elemental analyzer. The proximate analysis (wt% daf) of microalgae was as follows; C = 43.85%, N = 7.86%, H = 6.07%, S = 0.71%, O (by difference) = 41.61%. Chlorella vulgaris sample contained 56.44 wt% protein, 12.4 wt% lipids, and 17.3 wt% carbohydrates. The methods followed for calculating the protein, lipids, and carbohydrate contents in microalgae can be found elsewhere (Maliutina et al., 2017)."
3,Pressurized entrained-flow pyrolysis experiments,"2.2 Pressurized entrained-flow pyrolysis experiments The pressurized entrained-flow experimental setup used in this study can operate at a maximum pressure of 7 MPa and temperatures of up to 900 °C. The entrained-flow reactor had an inner diameter of 20 mm and was heated in an electric furnace with five heating zones. The total length of the heating zone was 1500 mm. The char collector at the bottom of the reactor was trace-heated to 250 °C. The reactor wall temperature was calibrated and found to be within ±10 °C of the furnace temperature. The pressure of the system was controlled by a pressure regulator and a back pressure valve. Pressurized pyrolysis experiments were carried out at temperatures of 600, 700, 800, and 900 °C and pressures of 1, 2 and 4 MPa. The sample feeding rate was 0.5 g/min. High purity nitrogen (99.999%) with a flow rate of 5 L/min was used as the sweep gas during pyrolysis experiments. This led to a gas residence time of 5–6 s in the reactor. For each experimental run, approximately 30 g of dried microalgae was charged to the feeder. The carrier-gas was split into two streams. One stream was passed through the feeding system to prevent any contact between the sample and pyrolysis gas and the second stream was heated to 300 °C in a preheater before being fed directly to the pyrolysis reactor. After purging the feeder and the reactor for 1 h, the system was heated and pressurized to the desired temperature and pressure. The reactor outlet gas was then analyzed using a portable flue gas analyzer (Testo 350) to ensure an inert atmosphere inside the reactor. The pyrolysis vapors were passed through two water-cooled (a mixture of water and ethylene glycol at −5 °C) condensers. The dissolved organic bio-oil was separated from dichloromethane (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) by distillation. The duration of each pyrolysis run was 30 min, after which the system was depressurized and the reactor was cooled to room temperature."
4,Product yields,"2.3 Product yields The total volatiles matter yield and char yield during pyrolysis of microalgae under different experimental conditions was calculated using ash tracer method (Eq. (1)) (Lewis and Fletcher, 2013). (1) % Mass Release Ash Tracer daf = 1 - X ash 0 X ash char 1 - X ash 0 where xash char and x0 ash were the ash content of the char and microalgae, respectively. The yield of non-condensable gases was calculated from micro-GC measurements and the volume of gases produced in pyrolysis reactor. The bio-oil yield was calculated by difference."
5,Bio-gas analysis,"2.4 Bio-gas analysis A micro gas chromatography system (490 Micro-GC, Agilent Technologies Equipment) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) with a 10 m (Molecule sieve) MS5A column and a 10 m (Polar Plot U) PPU column was used for the analysis of bio-gas derived from pressurized entrained-flow reactor. The injection temperature of MS and PPU columns was set as 60 °C and 75 °C and the column temperatures were 85 °C and 120 °C, respectively. The pressure of MS and PPU columns was set as 150 and 120 kPa, respectively. Helium and argon were used as carrier gases in the columns and the micro-GC was calibrated with standard gases prior to experiments."
6,Bio-oil analysis,"2.5 Bio-oil analysis A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS, Thermo Scientific ISQ) was used for detailed analysis of bio-oil samples. GC–MS analysis allowed a semi-quantitative comparison of chemical compounds in bio-oil samples derived from pressurized pyrolysis. The GC–MS contained a capillary column and an electron impact (70 eV) quadruple analyzer. The GC oven was first ramped from 40 to 100 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min, followed by heating from 100 to 280 °C at 15 °C/min, before being held at 280 °C for 15 min. The carrier gas was helium with a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The GC–MS data were analyzed in comparison with the equipment database. The water content in the bio-oil (wt%) was determined by separation with crystallohydrate (CaCl2, anhydrous, p.a; ISO 9001) and the weight difference."
7,Bio-char characterization,"2.6 Bio-char characterization The elemental composition of bio-chars was measured using a Euro Vector Euro EA elemental analyzer. The surface morphology of microalgae bio-chars was studied using scanning electron microscopy analysis (SEM, ZEISS Sigma HD). The swelling ratio of bio-char particles under pressurized pyrolysis conditions was calculated by dividing the average particle size of bio-chars to that of raw microalgae (d/d0). The effect of pressure on the carbon structure of bio-chars was investigated using a Horiba Jobin Yvon Xplora plus Raman spectrometer. The spectrometer was equipped with a 50X lens that focused the 532 nm Ar laser beam on the bio-char samples. The Raman spectra (500–2500 cm−1) of three bio-char particles were randomly obtained for each sample. A commercially available data processing program (Origin Plus) was applied for curve-fitting analysis of Raman spectra of bio-chars to gain a detailed understanding of the changes in microcrystalline structure of chars."
8,Results and discussion,
9,The influence of pressure on pyrolysis product yields,"3.1 The influence of pressure on pyrolysis product yields Fig. 1 shows the volatile matter yields during pressurized entrained-flow pyrolysis of microalgae as a function of pyrolysis pressure. The pressurized pyrolysis results were compared with the entrained-flow pyrolysis of microalgae at atmospheric pressure which was reported in our previous study (Maliutina et al., 2017). In general, the volatile matter yield decreased with pyrolysis pressure at all temperatures studied and the decreasing trend was more significant at pressures above 1 MPa. As expected, higher pyrolysis temperatures led to an increase in primary decomposition and higher volatile matter yields. At lower pyrolysis temperatures of 600 °C and 700 °C, the difference in volatile matter yields between atmospheric and 4 MPa pressure was 17.68% and 12.80%, respectively. However, the influence of pressure on total volatile release was not significant at 800 °C and 900 °C, with a yield difference of only 5.25% and 4.34%, respectively. Lower volatile matter yields at higher pyrolysis pressures can be explained by the effect of pressure on the vapor-liquid equilibrium and hindered mass transport within char particle (Zeng and Fletcher, 2005). At elevated temperatures, heavier tar molecules tended to remain in the char as their low vapor pressure couldn’t overcome the surrounding pressures to escape from the char particle. On the other hand, light tar molecules and light gases had higher vapor pressures and could leave the char particle, even at pressures as high as 4 MPa. The yields of bio-char, bio-oil, and bio-gas from entrained-flow pyrolysis of microalgae at elevated pressures were obtained and compared with the atmospheric pressure results in Table 1 (Maliutina et al., 2017). The distribution of pyrolysis products changed greatly with pyrolysis temperature and pressure. As expected, the bio-char yield generally decreased with pyrolysis temperature at all the pyrolysis pressures studied. However, a completely different trend was observed in bio-char when the system pressure was increased. The bio-char yield increased monotonically with increasing pressure at all temperatures tested. As discussed above, this observation can be attributed to the hindering effect of pressure on the release of heavy tar components from microalgae. As a result, heavier tar molecules were retained in char structure, leading to higher char yields at elevated pressures. The bio-oil yield generally decreased at elevated pressures, particularly at lower pyrolysis temperatures. Lower bio-oil yields can be attributed to the cracking and reforming of tar to light gases as well as the condensation reactions, which lead to retention of tar molecules in the carbonaceous char structure. These results indicated that these reaction were promoted at elevated pressures. At all pressures tested, the bio-oil yield was highest at 800 °C. This may be attributed to higher thermal stability of lipids in microalgae structure which decompose at higher temperatures compared to proteins and carbohydrates (Wang et al., 2017). The highest bio-oil yield of 71.08 wt% was obtained at 800 °C and 1 MPa. The content of water in bio-oil showed a decreasing trend at higher temperatures and pressures. This may be due to the higher dehydration of bio-oil and possibly steam gasification of char at elevated temperatures and pressures (Yuan et al., 2015). It can be seen in Table 1 that pyrolysis pressure had a negative impact on the yield of non-considerable gases and the lower bio-gas yields were obtained at elevated pressures regardless of pyrolysis temperature. This observation can be explained by longer residence time of volatiles inside microalgae particles at higher pressures which led to higher chance of secondary polymerization and condensation reactions, thereby increasing the char yield in expense of light gases. These results indicated that pyrolysis pressure had a significant impact on the yield of pyrolysis products of microalgae under entrained-flow conditions."
10,Effect of pressure on composition of bio-oil,"3.2 Effect of pressure on composition of bio-oil The influence of pressure on the composition of microalgae bio-oils was investigated using GC–MS analysis and the results were compared with those of atmospheric pressures (Maliutina et al., 2017). Bio-oils derived from entrained-flow pressurized pyrolysis of microalgae were a mixture of different organic compounds. To investigate the effects of pressure on bio-oil composition, the detected compounds were grouped into aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons (single-ring), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), oxygen-containing species (O-containing), alcohols, acids, esters, phenols, nitrogen-containing species (N-containing), and others. Fig. 2 shows the chemical composition of bio-oil derived from entrained-flow pyrolysis of microalgae as a function of pyrolysis pressure and temperature. The detailed composition of bio-oils is given in Table 2 . It should be noted that only compounds with GC–MS peak areas of higher than 0.5% are listed in Table 2. It can be seen in Fig. 2 that the concentration of single-ring aromatics, such as benzene, ethylbenzene and styrene, which accounted for nearly 16–47 area% in temperature range of 600–900 °C and atmospheric pressure decreased significantly to lower than 3.5 area% under pressurized pyrolysis conditions. At atmospheric pressures, PAHs in bio-oil increased with temperature and accounted for 14.3 and 18.2 area% of bio-oils at 800 and 900 °C, respectively. PAHs at atmospheric pressure consisted of mostly Naphthalene and its derivatives. As shown in Fig. 2a, the composition of bio-oils derived from pressurized pyrolysis of microalgae at 600 °C was slightly different from that at atmospheric pressure. Predominant compounds formed at elevated pressures were alcohols and nitrogen-containing species. The 3,7,11,15-Tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol with concentrations as high as 20.5 area% was the major alcohol component in bio-oil. The highest alcohol yield was obtained at 1 MPa, which decreased with further increasing pyrolysis pressure. This was accompanied by a relative increase in concentrations of PAHs and phenols in bio-oil. Olefins acted as precursors for Diels-Alder reactions and formation of cyclohexene ring. Further dehydrogenation of cyclohexene systems and oxidation in presence of nitrous oxide led to the formation of phenols. Phenolics may also form during decomposition of basic amino acids such as Tryptophan in microalgae. The major nitrogen-containing compounds at 600 °C were pyridine and derivatives, indolizine, imidazole, indole and derivatives and quinoline. Small amounts (<1 area%) of nitrogen-containing chemicals such as paromomicyn and deoxyspergualin were also detected in bio-oil. The highest yield of nitrogen-containing compounds (28.53 area%) was obtained at 1 MPa. Naphthalene and derivatives were the major PAHs at atmospheric pyrolysis bio-oil, while elevated pressures led to the formation of biphenyl, 1H-Indene, 1-methylene, naphthalene, naphthalene, 1-methyl, phenanthrene, and pyrene. Fig. 2b shows the composition of bio-oil derived from entrained-flow pyrolysis of microalgae at 700 °C. It can be seen that the influence of pressure on bio-oil composition at 700 °C was higher than that of 600 °C. The concentration of aliphatic hydrocarbons fell sharply with increasing the pressure to 1 MPa (2.89%) and the aliphatic hydrocarbons were not detected at higher pressures of 2 and 4 MPa. A similar trend was observed for single-ring aromatics. This was accompanied by promotion of condensation reactions and PAHs formation, especially at pressures higher than 2 MPa. The concentration of PAHs in bio-oil at 700 °C reached a maximum of 53.02 area% at 4 MPa. The highest concentration of nitrogen-containing species in bio-oil (37.42 area%) at 700 °C was obtained at 1 MPa and decreased to 17.26 area% with further increasing the pressure to 4 MPa. A similar trend was observed for phenols, where its content in bio-oil reached 16.09 area% at 1 MPa and then fell sharply to 7.59 area% at 4 MPa. Fig. 2c and d shows that the changes in chemical compositions of bio-oils at 800 °C and 900 °C with pyrolysis pressure followed a similar trend. At 800 °C (Fig. 2c), the concentration of nitrogen-containing species increased from 27.16 area% at 0.1 MPa and reached a maximum of 46.60 area% at 1 MPa, which was the highest among all experimental conditions tested. These results indicated the great potential of pressurized entrained-flow method for selective production of high value nitrogen containing compounds. These value-added nitrogen-containing species may find applications in biochemical and bio-medical industries. Further increasing pyrolysis pressure led to a slight decrease in the concentration of nitrogenated species in bio-oils. Fig. 2d shows that the nitrogen-containing species were mostly decomposed at 900 °C. Detailed analysis of compounds in Table 2 showed that pyridine and derivatives, indolizine and imidazole were decreased at 900 °C, while the formation of nitrogen-containing polyaromatics such as quinoline, phenantridine and carbazole were promoted. Ring expansion of indole may lead to the formation of quinoline (Gribble and Kishbaugh, 2016). One major feature of bio-oil derived from entrained-flow pyrolysis at elevated pressures and temperatures of higher than 800 °C was the formation of significantly large amount of PAHs, which was in great contrast with the bio-oil derived from atmospheric pressure pyrolysis. The 4, 5, and 6 fused ring PAHs were hardly detected at temperatures below 800 °C. It can be seen in Table 2 that when the temperature was increased from 800 °C to 900 °C, the concentrations of acenaphthylene, naphthalene and derivatives, biphenylene, fluorene, benz[a]anthracene, 7H-Benzo[c]fluorine, fluoranthene, and pyrene increased significantly. The maximum PAHs concentration of 72 area% was obtained at 4 MPa and 900 °C. PAHs were formed during secondary pyrolysis reactions and direct fusion of benzene radicals, which were promoted at higher pyrolysis temperature and pressure. The increased residence time of radicals in bio-char due to the pressure effect may also enhance the formation of PAHs. The possible reaction pathways during decomposition of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids in microalgae structure were postulated based on the composition of microalgae and pyrolysis products. The decomposition of carbohydrates (R1) may result in the formation of phenols, acids, alcohols, esters, and oxygen-containing heterocyclic species. Gunawardena and Fernando (2011) suggested that the decomposition and restructuring of glucose under pressure led to the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons such as styrene and phenolics. Decomposition of proteins in microalgae cellular structure (R2) involved cracking of primary peptide bonds to form intermediate nitrogenated precursors. The major reaction pathways for the formation of primary nitrogen-containing species such imidazole, pyridine, and indole were discussed in detailed in our previous study (Maliutina et al., 2017). These compounds are formed during decomposition of basic amino acids such as tryptophan and histidine (Gallois et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2017). The amino acids generated from proteins may react with sugarsderived from carbohydrates to form nitrogen heterocyclic compounds (Chen et al., 2014; Sheng et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2015). At elevated pressures, the promotion of dehydration and dehydrogenation reactions lead to the formation of linear amines and amides (precursors for Diels-Alder reactions), subsequently forming nitrogenated aromatics (such as pyridine) with unsaturated side-chains. Linear amines, amides, pyridine and derivatives may act as precursors for quinoline, isoquinoline and phenanthridine. This process involves the release of nitrogen-containing gases such as HCN and NH3, which play an important role during secondary pyridine (Diels-Alder mechanism) and benzonitrile formation. Pyridine can be formed during the reaction of vinyl cyanide or cyano radicals with unsaturated hydrocarbons (Diels-Alder mechanism). The detailed analysis of bio-oils indicated the formation of nitrogen-substituted polycyclic aromatics (NPAHs), which were not detected at atmospheric pressure. The NPAHs such as quinoline, isoquinoline, phenanthridine, and carbazole can be formed from pyridine precursors during hydrogen abstraction, acetylene addition reaction (HACA) (Parker and Kaiser, 2017), which were promoted at elevated pressures. Primary decomposition of lipids led to the formation of acids, aldehydes and ketones (R3). The secondary decomposition of acids, aldehydes and ketones led to the formation of gaseous species such as CO, CO2 and water. Some oxygen-containing species such as benzofuran were also detected in microalgae bio-oil under pressurized conditions which were formed as a result of cyclization of esters (Khaghaninejad and Heravi, 2014). The majority of chemical compounds detected in microalgae bio-oil at elevated temperatures and pressures were PAHs (Fig. 2 and Table 2). Some PAHs such as acenaphthylene, fluorene, benz[a]anthracene, 7H-Benzo[c]fluorine, and fluoranthene were only detected in bio-oils derived from entrained-flow pyrolysis at higher temperatures (800 °C and 900 °C) and pressures (Table 2). Hydrogen Abstraction-Acetylene Addition (HACA) and Diels-Alder mechanisms are knows as the major mechanisms for the formation of PAHs (Kislov et al., 2005; Kislov et al., 2013). Kislov et al. (2005) showed that the Diels-Alder tractions has a lower rate constants at high temperatures compared with the HACA reactions. Therefore, the Diels-Alder reactions (R7 and R8) were likely the major mechanism of formation of acenaphthalene, phenanthrene, and pyrene at lower temperatures (Kislov et al., 2005). These results agreed with the proposed polyaromatics formation and growth mechanism in the literature (Comandini et al., 2012; Ranzi et al., 2017; Wang and Violi, 2006). Single ring aromatic hydrocarbons may act as precursors for the formation of PAHs. Naphthalene was detected in all bio-oil samples, indicating that R4 (Bittner-Howard mechanism) took place under all experimental conditions. However, the presence of PAHs with 3 or more rings indicated the formation of acenaphthalene via R5 and R6 reactions (Frenklach mechanism) by HACA-sequence in parallel to R4 reaction. Acenaphthalene then acted as the precursor for HACA reactions, leading to the ring growth and formation of larger PAHs such as phenanthrene and pyrene (Kislov et al., 2005). It should be noted that the ring growth mechanism led to the release of a large amount of hydrogen radicals during secondary pyrolysis reactions. Biphenylene and biphenyl were mostly detected in bio-oil derived from pressurized entrained-flow pyrolysis of microalgae at temperatures of higher than 700 °C (Table 2). Biphenylene may form by direct combination of two o-Benzyne radicals. The rupture of one C–C bond in biphenylene structure may lead to the formation of biphenyl. The biphenyl-ion can further act as the precursor for the formation of phenanthrene via the HACA mechanism (R8). It can be concluded that that higher pressures and temperatures promoted the HACA reactions, leading to a significant increase in the concentration of PAHs with 3, 4 and 5 rings in microalgae bio-oil."
11,Effect of pressure on composition of bio-gas,"3.3 Effect of pressure on composition of bio-gas Fig. 3 compares the composition of bio-gas derived from entrained-flow pyrolysis of microalgae under different experimental conditions. The atmospheric pressure results were adopted from our previous study (Maliutina et al., 2017). The main gaseous species at atmospheric pressure and low temperatures were CO2 and CO. With increasing temperature at atmospheric pressure, the formation of CO and H2 was promoted, while the concentrations of CO2, CH4, and C2H6 were greatly decreased. It can be seen in Fig. 3 that pyrolysis pressure had a remarkable influence on the composition of bio-gas at all temperatures studied. Unlike atmospheric pressure, the major component of bio-gas at elevated pressures was hydrogen, while a significant decrease in the concentrations of CO, CO2, and CH4 was observed. Hydrogen formation under pressurized pyrolysis conditions can be partly attributed to dehydrogenation of radicals, the secondary tar cracking and condensation reactions as a result of longer residence time of volatiles in microalgae char particle and direct dehydrogenation of char at elevated pressures (Muradov et al., 2010; Uzun et al., 2007). As discussed above, higher pyrolysis pressures promoted the formation of PAHs via Hydrogen Abstraction-Acetylene Addition (HACA) reaction (Fig. 2). Hydrogen was continuously released during ring growth in HACA, leading to a significant increase in the concentration of H2 in the gas phase. The maximum H2 concentration in bio-gas (88.01 vol%) was obtained at 4 MPa and 900 °C. In order to better understand the fate of hydrogen during pressurized pyrolysis, the distribution of hydrogen in pyrolysis products as a function of pyrolysis pressure and at 900 °C was calculated from the elemental analysis of bio-char and bio-oil and the hydrogen content of the bio-gas and the results are shown in Fig. 4 . It can be seen that with increasing pyrolysis pressure, the retention of hydrogen in bio-char was decreased steadily from 10.93 wt% to 6.73 wt%. A similar trend was observed for bio-oil, where the hydrogen content decreased from 65.92 wt% at 0.1 MPa to 53.42 wt% at 4 MPa. This was accompanied by a significant increase in the hydrogen transfer to the bio-gas. With increasing pyrolysis pressure from 0.1 MPa to 4 MPa, the hydrogen content of bio-gas increased from 23.15 wt% to 39.84 wt%, indicating that elevated pressures enhanced the hydrogen transfer to the gas phase in the form of H2. This significant observation implies great potential of microalgae pressurized entrained-flow pyrolysis for enhanced large scale H2 production. Fig. 3 showed that CH4 concentration is bio-gas was enhanced at higher pyrolysis temperature and at atmospheric pressure due to the release of methoxy groups from microalgae structure during primary pyrolysis as well as tar cracking (Blanco López et al., 2002). Higher pyrolysis pressures led to a decrease in concentration of CH4. As discussed above, this was accompanied by enhanced hydrogen formation at elevated pressure. Therefore it can be postulated that part of hydrogen was formed as a result of decomposition of methane during secondary pyrolysis reactions (Shah et al., 2001). The decrease in CO2 concentration in bio-gas at higher pyrolysis temperatures and pressures (Fig. 3c and d) may have enhanced the water gas shift and methane reforming reactions leading to the formation of more H2 (Beneroso et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2016). These results indicated that pressurized entrained-flow pyrolysis of microalgal is a promising approach for the large scale production of hydrogen rich bio-gas, which may find wide applications in power generation, hydrogen fuel-cells, and production of fertilisers."
12,The influence of pressure on bio-char morphology and carbon structure,"3.4 The influence of pressure on bio-char morphology and carbon structure The SEM analysis of the bio-chars derived from the pressurized entrained-flow pyrolysis of microalgae indicated that pyrolysis conditions had a significant influence on the morphology of microalgae bio-char. The sphericity and surface smoothness of the bio-char particles increased at higher pyrolysis temperature and pressure. The higher smoothness of char particles at elevated pressures suggested that microalgae bio-chars underwent softening and plastic layer formation under pressurized entrained-flow fast pyrolysis conditions. Formation of blow holes was observed on bio-char particles especially at elevated pressures, which can be attributed to the fast release of volatiles from the softened bio-char particles. Extensive bubble formation was evident under the surface of microalgae bio-chars at high pressures. The bobble growth during fact devolatilization of microalgae under pressure led to the formation of larger char particles with hollow structure. Similar morphologies have been reported in literature for bituminous coal chars at elevated pressures (Yu et al., 2004, 2007; Zeng and Fletcher, 2005). The swelling ratios of microalgae bio-chars under entrained-flow pyrolysis conditions and as a function of pressure was calculated from the average particle size of bio-chars compared to that of the raw biomass (d/d0). Elevated pressures had a significant influence on the swelling of bio-char particles, where the swelling ratio increased with pressure and peaked at 2 MPa and decreased with further increasing the pressure to 4 MPa. Swelling ratios as high as 10 were observed for bio-chars formed at 2 MPa and under fast entrained-flow pyrolysis conditions. This phenomenon can be explained by two competing forces during pressurized pyrolysis. Continuous devolatilization and the increased fluidity of the bio-char led to bubble growth and enhanced particle swelling under pressure (Yu et al., 2004). On the other hand, higher pressures in particle surroundings limited the bubble growth and restrained the particle swelling. Consequently, there existed an optimum pressure of 2 MPa where the swelling of bio-char reached a maximum value. The elemental composition of microalgae bio-chars as a function of pyrolysis pressure and temperature is given in Table 3 . At atmospheric pressure, the carbon content of bio-chars increased monotonically with pyrolysis temperature, while the nitrogen and oxygen content of char was decreased, implying that the devolatilisation was enhanced at higher temperatures. However, a drastically different trend was observed for the changes in composition of bio-chars with pyrolysis pressure. Pyrolysis of microalgae at elevated pressures led to a lower carbon content in char, while the nitrogen and oxygen retention in char was enhanced. These results agreed with the total volatile matter yields in Fig. 1, implying that pyrolysis at elevated pressured led to increased retention of oxygen and nitrogen in bio-char, thereby decreasing the volatile matter yields. A different trend was observed for the hydrogen content in bio-char, which was decreased at higher pyrolysis pressures, implying the promotion of dehydrogenation reactions under pressurized conditions. The retention of oxygen in char and enhanced release of hydrogen can explain the higher H2 and lower CO and CO2 concentrations in bio-gas (Fig. 3). The effects of pyrolysis conditions on carbon structure of bio-chars were investigated using Raman spectroscopy. Curve-fitting analysis was carried on the Raman spectra of bio-char to gain a better understanding of the changes in their microcrystalline structure under pressurized entrained-flow conditions. The Raman spectra of chars were curve-fitted to a series of five bands in the first order Raman region. Peak assignments were done according to the literature (Maliutina et al., 2017; Zhu and Sheng, 2010). The band at 1586 cm−1 (G band) was assigned to the E2g symmetry in graphite layers (Zhu and Sheng, 2010). The D1 band at 1362 cm−1 was interpreted as aromatic clusters having more than 6 rings (Li, 2007). The D2, D3, and D4 bands at around 1683, 1501, and 1174 cm−1 were assigned as disordered surface graphene layers, functional groups and small aromatic clusters, and aromatic ethers, respectively (Li, 2007; Sheng, 2007). The higher full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the defect bands (D2, D3, and D4) in Raman spectra suggested that the carbon structure of bio-chars was highly amorphous in nature. The changes in band area ratios of ID1 /IG (small ring clusters to the G band), ID3 + ID4 /IG (ratio of structural defects, organic matrix, and functional groups to the G band), and IG /IAll (G band to the integrated area under the Raman spectrum) were used to investigate the influence of pyrolysis pressure on the carbon structure of microalgae bio-chars. The changes in the band area ratios are shown in Fig. 5 . It can be seen in Fig. 5a that at atmospheric pressure, the ID1 /IG ratio of bio-chars increased with pyrolysis temperature, indicating an increase in concentration of relatively small aromatic rings with around 6 benzene rings (Zhu and Sheng, 2010). This was accompanied by lower IG /IAll ratios at higher temperatures (Fig. 5b). These results suggested that at atmospheric pressure, the temperatures of 600–900 °C were not high enough to cause any significant structural ordering in carbon structure of bio-char and the major phenomenon under these conditions was the removal of functional groups and organic constituents from bio-char (Maliutina et al., 2017). The detailed Raman spectroscopy analysis of bio-chars derived from pressurized entrained-flow pyrolysis indicated that pressure had a significant influence on the carbon structure of bio-chars. It can be seen in Fig. 5a that the ID1 /IG ratio of bio-chars decreased sharply at elevated pressures. The changes in ID1 /IG ratio were more significant at higher temperatures. These results suggested that at elevated pressure, the small aromatic ring clusters in bio-char structure were turned into turbostratic carbon. This was supported by the increasing trend of the IG /IAll ratio of bio-chars with pyrolysis pressure (Fig. 5b), indicating a more ordered carbon structure in bio-chars derived from pressurized entrained-flow pyrolysis. Fig. 5c shows that the ID3 + ID4 /IG ratio of bio-chars decreased with pyrolysis pressure, implying that structural defects, organic matrix, and functional groups were removed from the bio-char structure at elevated pressures."
13,Conclusion,"The influence of pressure on the pyrolysis behavior of microalgae was investigated. Higher pyrolysis pressures promoted the formation of nitrogen-containing species, where the highest yield of 46.60 area% was obtained at 800 °C and 1 MPa. The promotion of HACA reactions during secondary pyrolysis led to a significant increase in the concentration of H2 in bio-gas and PAHs in bio-oil. The highest H2 concentration of 88.01 vol% was obtained at 900 °C and 4 MPa. Different from atmospheric pressure, pyrolysis at elevated pressures showed a great potential for poly-generation of H2, nitrogen containing compounds and highly porous bio-char."
