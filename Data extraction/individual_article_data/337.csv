0,Introduction,"Increasing demand for fossil fuels is one of the main causes of climate change and global warming. Fuel deposits are rapidly decreasing, and there is a limited energy supply for the next 150–200 years [1–3]. It is important to find alternative energy resources that are environmentally friendly, low cost, and renewable [1]. Biofuels are one of the possible renewable energy sources and are expected to play an important function in the energy supply in the future [4]. Hydrogen is known as a clean energy source, with a high energy capacity and a high energy yield of 122 kJ/g, which is 2.75 times greater than hydrocarbon fuels [5]. Biological hydrogen production is an environmentally-friendly way of hydrogen production from renewable sources, while non-biological processes rely on non-renewable materials and fossil feedstocks which release gaseous emissions, particularly CO and CO2 [6–8]. There are four different biological processes that can produce biohydrogen gas. Among these processes, dark fermentation is the most widely reported in the literature [9–11]. The advantages of dark fermentation are high yield, low cost, and simple operation on a small scale [12]. However, a drawback is a low hydrogen production rate. In the fermentative process, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) such as acetic, butyric, propionic and lactic acids occur as intermediates and by-products [13]. The VFAs cause a pH drop in the system and inhibit bacterial growth, which is the main cause of an unexpectedly low hydrogen production yield [14–16]. Nanoparticles are widely used in biosystems. Many researchers have attempted to use nanotechnology for enhancing biohydrogen production rate and yield. Nanoparticles react rapidly with electron donors leading to a kinetic improvement [17]. They also act as biocatalysts to improve the performance and enhance the activities of microorganisms [18]. Numerous nanoparticles have been applied to promote biohydrogen production including gold [19], silver [20], copper [21], Ni and NiO [22,23], Fe2O3 [24], Fe3O4 [25], hydrotalcite (HT) [26] and activated carbon [27]. Activated carbon is known to be a versatile and effective adsorbent. It is mainly used for removing metals from wastewater and unwanted compounds from gas, vapors, and liquids in the chemical industries, and removing pollutants in soil. Activated carbon possesses a highly porous structure, large surface area and high adsorption capacity [28–30]. Thus, it was used as a supporting material for metal nanoparticles [31] such as Ni loaded on activated carbon [32] and zerovalent iron on activated carbon [33]. In general, there are two main processes for preparing activated carbon: physical and chemical activations. In chemical activation, KOH, ZnCl2, H3PO4, and K2CO3 are commonly used as chemical activation agents to activate the precursor materials [34]. H3PO4 is a more preferable chemical agent for replacing ZnCl2 because of environmental and economic concerns, lower temperature and easy recovery [35]. The advantages of using commercial activated carbon are time savings and no requirements for burning bio-char. Numerous studies were interested in the modification of commercial activated carbon by using H3PO4 as a chemical agent for improving the efficiency of adsorption capacity, especially for organic compounds [36–38]. In dark fermentation, activated carbon was added into a system with an optimum concentration of cocultures, 200 g/L [27]. Efficient hydrogen production was achieved at a yield of 1.203 mol H2/mol glucose. Wimonsong and Nitisoravut [39] found that the optimum loading of activated carbon was 33.0 mg/L. This enhanced the hydrogen production yield to 2.60 mol H2/mol sucrose, which was a 73 % increment as compared to the control. The possible roles of activated carbon are to adsorb VFAs and to provide a high surface area where the microorganisms can grow easily on surfaces, as well as to sustain the cell viability and enhance the density [40]. HTs and HT-like compounds (HTLCs) or layered double hydroxides (LDHs), which are also known as anionic clays, have been used in many applications such as adsorption, catalysis, biomedicine, separation, ion exchange, acidic-basic buffering, and environmental treatment [41,42]. There were also a few studies that used HTs to improve the hydrogen production via dark fermentation [26,43,44]. The effects of HT concentrations ranging from 0 mg/L to 833 mg/L were studied. The optimum concentration for biohydrogen production was 167 mg/L using anaerobic sludge as the inoculum and sucrose as the substrate. The maximum hydrogen production was up to 2.30 mol H2/mol sucrose [44]. Similarly, Ni-Mg-Al HT was used in batch experiments using sucrose as the substrate and anaerobic sludge as the inoculum. The optimum concentration was 250 mg/L, and the maximum hydrogen production yield was 3.37 mol H2/mol [43]. In the study of Wimonsong and colleagues [26], HT combined with Au nanoparticle could enhance the hydrogen production yield up to 2.74 mol H2/mol sucrose with the an optimum concentration of 167 mg/L. The structure of HT consists of elements, which microorganisms can use as micronutrients once released. The biohydrogen production was enhanced due to the presence of basic centers in HTs and bacteria immobilized in the interlaminar structure of HTs, which enabled electron transfer. This provided a better chance of contact with the substrate [26,43,44]. This study improves the biohydrogen production rate and yield by using a composite material of modified commercial activated carbon as the support for Zn-Ni-HT."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Inoculum and substrate,"2.1 Inoculum and substrate The inoculum was collected from an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor from a brewery company in Thailand. The anaerobic sludge was pre-treated at 105 °C for 30 min to inhibit the activity of methanogens prior to use as an inoculum. Sucrose (20 g/L) was used as a carbon source for bacteria. The nutrient solution was comprised of NH4HCO3 (160 mg/L), KH2PO4 (80 mg/L), FeCl2⋅4H2O (70.5 mg/L), MgSO4⋅7H2O (4 mg/L), NaCl (0.4 mg/L), MnSO4⋅7H2O (0.6 mg/L), Na2MoO4⋅2H2O (0.4 mg/L), and CaCl2⋅2H2O (0.4 mg/L)."
3,Modified commercial activated carbon by H3PO4,"2.2 Modified commercial activated carbon by H3PO4 Commercial activated carbon (CAC) was obtained from the Carbokarn Co., Ltd., Thailand. It was made from coconut shell and consists of granules. The activated carbon was sieved to approximately 1 mm particles size. Commercial activated carbon was modified by the impregnation method using H3PO4. The ratio of commercial activated carbon to concentrated H3PO4 was 1:1(w/w). The acid solution was prepared with 14 mL of H3PO4 (85 % W/V) diluted to 150-mL. The modified activated carbon was prepared by an impregnation method. Commercial activated carbon (20 g) was soaked in the H3PO4 solution and shaken at 90 rpm for 12 h. The mCAC was then heated at temperatures of 400 °C, 500 °C, 600 °C and 700 °C under N2 atmosphere for 1 h. After the heating process, it washed with distilled water until pH 7 and dried at 105 °C for 24 h."
4,Commercial activated carbon support for HT preparation,"2.3 Commercial activated carbon support for HT preparation Activated carbon was used as a support for HT to enhance the activity for fermentative hydrogen production. Activated carbon supported HT was prepared by the incipient impregnation method. The Zn-HT solution was prepared using 0.13 g of Zn(NO3)2⋅6H2O, 1.17 g of Mg(NO3)2⋅6H2O and 0.34 g of Al(NO3)3⋅9H2O in 6-mL of water. Likewise, Ni-HT solution was prepared using 0.13 g of Ni(NO3)3⋅6H2O, 1.17 g of Mg(NO3)2⋅6H2O, and 0.34 g of Al(NO3)3⋅9H2O in 6-mL of water. The 6-mL Zn-HT solution was added dropwise to 6 g of activated carbon under continuous mixing. Then, the samples were dried in an oven at 60 °C for 1 h. After that, the mixture was dried at 105 °C for 3 h. Similarly, these processes were also applied to Ni-HT. Then, a 6-mL mixed solution of NaOH (2.25 M) and Na2CO3 (0.45 M) was prepared and co-precipitated by adding dropwise onto the activated carbon. Aging was performed in an autoclave at 60 °C for 24 h. The samples were then dried at 60 °C for 4 h, washed with distilled water until pH 7 was obtained, and dried at 105 °C for 24 h."
5,Experimental procedure,"2.4 Experimental procedure Batch experiments were conducted in 120-mL serum bottles. The optimum concentration of catalyst was determined by adding the activated carbon supported HT at a concentration of 8.33 g/L to the fermentation mixture, comprised of 5-ml of nutrient, pre-treated sludge (10-mL solution), and 45-mL of the substrate. The control samples were without activated carbon supported HT. The initial pH was adjusted to 5.5 by using NaOH (1 N) or HCl (1 N). The bottles were capped with butyl rubber stoppers and sealed with aluminum crimps. To create anaerobic conditions, the bottles were sparged with nitrogen for 3 min. To prevent the activities of photosynthetic bacteria, the serum bottles were wrapped with aluminum foil. Finally, the serum bottles were cultivated in an incubated shaker under mesophilic conditions at 37 °C and shaken at 90 rpm. The amounts of produced gases were measured by syringes at room temperature. The compositions of gases were determined by a gas chromatograph. After 240 h of fermentation, mixed liquor samples were drawn to determine the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and pH."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods The characteristics of commercial activated carbon supported HT were analyzed by nitrogen adsorption isotherms (surface area analyzer, BET), and the morphologies of the activated carbon supported HT were examined by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) at the Center of Scientific Equipment for Advanced Research, Thammasat University, Thailand. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to determine the functional groups. FTIR spectra were recorded on a 6700 spectrophotometer at ambient temperature using the potassium bromide (KBr) disk method. All samples were prepared from a disk containing 0.001 g of sample mixed with 0.1 g of potassium bromide (KBr). The spectra were recorded at 4 cm−1 resolution for a total of 32 scans with wavenumbers ranging from 400 to 4000 cm−1. The structure of HT was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) at the National Nanotechnology Center, Thailand."
7,Kinetic modeling,"2.6 Kinetic modeling The modified Gompertz model was used for fermentative hydrogen production, to describe the progress of a batch fermentative hydrogen production process and to establish the relationships among the substrate degradation rate, the hydrogen-producing growth rate, and the product formation rate (Eq. 1). (1) H= H max exp - exp R m *e H max λ-t +1 where, H and Hmax denote the cumulative hydrogen production (mL) and the maximum hydrogen production (mL), respectively. Rm represents the hydrogen production rate (mL/h), λ is the lag-phase time, a period of little to no replication seen in bacteria that are introduced to new media (h), and t is the cultivation time (h)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterizations of supporting materials,"3.1 Characterizations of supporting materials 3.1.1 Surface area and pore volume Commercial activated carbon may vary in properties and qualities, depending upon the carbon precursors and activation processes. The specific surface area is typically from 500 to 1500 m2/g [45]. Re-activation using H3PO4 was implemented to refresh the properties of CAC and remove impurities such as acids, alcohols, and other chemical compounds contained in the pores. Thus, the pores became open, leading to an increase in pore sizes. Moreover, the re-activation could improve the properties of the surface by increasing the adsorption capacity [46]. As reported by many researchers, this process could increase the specific surface area by up to 15 % (Table 1 ). As this study incorporated not only H3PO4 activation but also heat treatment, the modifications caused a decrease in specific surface area by up to 98 %. This almost destroyed the porous structure of CAC. A decrease in the specific surface area as a result of heat treatment was also observed by Martinez et al. [47]. However, the consequences were more severe in this study. This indicated the negative impact of heat treatment on the specific surface area of CAC, as it physically destroyed the porous structure, resulting in a pore volume reduction from 0.26 to 0.01-0.05 cm3/g. Anisuzzaman et al. [36] also reported a loss of weight, shrinkage of the carbon structure, and a porosity reduction for temperatures above 500 °C. When the CAC was impregnated with Zn-Ni-HT, the specific surface area slightly decreased. This was possibly due to the nanosized HT which blocked the pores of CAC, causing a reduction in the specific surface area [26,48]. When mCAC600 was impregnated with Zn-Ni-HT, the specific surface area was nearly the same as Zn-Ni-HT/CAC. This indicated that the specific surface area was mainly contributed by HT as the porous structure of CAC and mCAC was blocked and destroyed. 3.1.2 Functional groups Fig. 1 shows FTIR spectra at 400−4000 cm−1 for CAC and mCAC. The spectra show similar peaks with and without modification. The broad band and strong absorption line at 3570-−3200 cm−1 represent the hydroxyl group (OH stretching), while 2370 cm−1 is attributed to CO2 (CO2 stretching). The band at 1500−1650 cm−1 is assigned to CC aromatic ring stretching. The band at 1200 cm-1 represents CC and CO vibration in alcohols, ethers and phenols. The peak from 700 to 800 cm−1 is assigned to the presence of CH out-of-plane bending in benzene derivatives. However, after H3PO4 activation, some phosphate compounds were left on the activated carbon surface. The bands at 900−1300 cm−1 are assigned to phosphorous species. The band around 1275 cm-−1 is assigned to the stretching mode of hydrogen-bonded PO, OC stretching vibration in the POC aromatic linkage, and POOH. The band around 1100 cm−1 is attributed to be the PO bond. The peak around 1000 cm−1 is assigned to ionized linkage the P+- O in acid phosphate esters [49–51]. Thus, the modifications of CAC by H3PO4 and heat treatments caused physical changes through the loss of the porous structure. The modification also caused the chemical changes with adding of phosphate functional groups, which could affect hydrogen production. For the impregnation of HT on CAC and mCAC, FTIR spectra (Fig. 2 ) clearly show the functional groups of HTs on the surface of activated carbon. The peak around 1556 cm−1 is assigned to H2O [26,44,52]. The band around 1384 cm−1 is assigned to carbonate the (CO3 2-) group. The peak around 400−800 cm−1 is assigned to the metal oxide group. 3.1.3 Structure of HT The XRD profiles of the CAC and mCAC supported HT are shown in Fig. 3 . The diffaction peak at a 2θ of 23° can be attributed to the structure of activated carbon [53]. The peaks at a 2θ of 43° and 62° correspond to NiO (200) and NiO (220) [54,55]. The peaks at a 2θ of 31°, 34.5° and 36.3°, which have been identified as Zinc oxide (ZnO), could be indexed to (100), (002) and (101), respectively [56]. The XRD patterns confirm the existence of Zn and Ni ions, which are components of hydrotalcite. 3.1.4 Morphology and porosity Fig. 4 shows the morphology and porosity structure of Zn-Ni-HT/CAC and Zn-Ni-HT/mCAC600. Examinations of Zn-Ni-HT/CAC and Zn-Ni-HT/mCAC600 showed that some particles of hydrotalcite were present in the pores and on the surface of the activated carbon."
10,Effect of supporting materials on biohydrogen production,"3.2 Effect of supporting materials on biohydrogen production The addition of supporting materials resulted in a higher hydrogen production yield and rate, as compared to control (no added supporting material). The highest cumulative hydrogen production was observed for mCAC600 about 6.58 mmol, which was 17 % higher than the control. mCAC400, mCAC500, and mCAC700 showed a similar result but lower in hydrogen production. The addition of CAC and modified CAC increased the hydrogen production yield. The t-test was calculated, as indicated in Table 2 , to provide a clearer understanding of the effects of modified CAC on biohydrogen production. For each term, a greater significance is expected at a smaller p-value. The modified CAC for H3PO4 and heat treatments showed statistically significant differences in the hydrogen production yield, compared to the control (p < 0.01). This means that the acid and temperature activation affect the hydrogen production yield. There was no statistically significant difference between CAC and the control (p > 0.01). Among the modified CAC, mCAC600 showed a statistically significant difference (p < 0.01) in hydrogen yield compared to other treatment conditions. The highest hydrogen production yield was 2.62 mol H2/mol sucrose. In addition, the modified CAC (by H3PO4) changed the characteristics of the activated carbon such as the surface area, pore size, volume, and functional groups. This affected the adsorption ability as it depended on these characteristics. H3PO4 with a high amount of oxygen changed the functional groups of the activated carbon, creating large pores on the surface of the activated-carbon surface [49]. Zn-Ni-HT was loaded on mCAC600 and CAC. The highest cumulative hydrogen production obtained for Zn-Ni-HT/mCAC600 was 7.24 mmol, whereas Zn-Ni-HT/mCAC generated 5.91 mmol H2. Zn-Ni-HT/mCAC600 increased the hydrogen production rate by approximately 30 % as compared to the control and about 12 % higher than mCAC600. When mCAC600 was impregnated with Zn-Ni-HT, it significantly affected the hydrogen production rate and yield. Table 3 shows a statistically significant difference (p < 0.01) for Zn-Ni-HT/mCAC600 compared to mCAC600 and Zn-Ni-HT/CAC. A positive effect may be due to the properties of HT that benefit fermentative conditions. First, the alkaline nature of HT can neutralize hydrogen ion during fermentation. Second, the structure of HT contains various anions and cations such as CO3 2−, Cl−, NO3 −, Zn2+, Mg2+, Na2+ and Fe2+ which are necessary micro-nutrients for microbial activities. Third, Zn was found to be an active site of several enzymes such as hydrogenase [26]. It is also an important trace element for most microorganisms as it can act as a bridge between enzymes and substrates. Last, Zn and Ni can help the efficient transfer of electrons to hydrogenase, which increases hydrogen production [44]. In this study, CAC was low in efficiency despite its ability to adsorb VFAs [39]. However, the modification of CAC by H3PO4 could improve hydrogen production. An inclusion of mCAC600 as a supporting material for Zn-Ni-HT in dark fermentation gave a better performance as it provided hybrid functions with the alkaline properties of HT and availability of micronutrients. The kinetic parameters such as the lag phase time, hydrogen production rate, and maximum hydrogen production were obtained by curve fitting using the Gompertz model (Table 4 ). All experimental data were fitted, with R2 > 0.99. The Zn-Ni-HT/mCAC600 shows the highest hydrogen production rate and yield. The addition of composite materials could significantly reduce the lag phase of fermentative hydrogen production compared to the control."
11,Soluble metabolize distribution,"3.3 Soluble metabolize distribution The residual volatile fatty acids (VFAs) are an important indicator for hydrogen production performance. Acetic, butyric, lactic and propionic acids were determined after fermentation. Theoretically, 8 mol and 4 mol of hydrogen per mole of sucrose are produced when acetic and butyric are by-products of reactions [13], respectively (Eqs. 2 and 3). (2) C 12 H 22 O 11 + 5 H 2 O → 4 CH 3 COOH+4 CO 2 +8 H 2 (3) C 12 H 22 O 11 + H 2 O → 2 CH 3 C H 2 CH 2 COOH+4 CO 2 +4 H 2 In this study, both acetic and butyric acids were observed, indicating multiple path-ways for hydrogen production. There were no lactic and propionic acids found. As can be seen in Fig. 5 , high concentrations of butyric acid were found in all treatments and the control. The concentration of butyric acid at the end of fermentation was highest at 6816 mg/L for thecontrol while the lowest was 2211 mg/L for mCAC600. It is well known that the practical hydrogen production yield is about 2 mol or slightly higher. In this study, the highest concentration of acetic acid was observed at 2704 mg/L for Zn-Ni-HT/mCAC600, which also provided the highest hydrogen production yield. The maximum hydrogen production yield with composite material was higher than the control but still lower than that in theory. Moreover, pH is a factor that affects hydrogen production. A lower pH inhibits the hydrogenase activity and production of VFAs in the system. A higher ending pH was observed for Zn-Ni-HT/CAC and Zn-Ni-HT/mCAC600 at 4.11 and 3.89, respectively (data not shown). The pH of samples containing HT was generally higher than the samples without HT. When HT was loaded on the activated carbon, it could prevent or slow a drop in pH and help adsorb unfavourable VFAs during fermentation."
12,Metal leaching of supporting materials,"3.4 Metal leaching of supporting materials As HT is constructed from multiple metal elements, there is a possibility of metal leaching causing effects on fermentative hydrogen production. Fig. 6 shows the metals, particularly Ni2+, Mg2+, and Al3+, which were leached out from the supporting materials under acidic conditions. It should be noted that Zn2+ was not detected in the fermentation broth. As Zn-HT was loaded prior to Ni-HT on the activated carbon during impregnation, it adheres firmly onto the surface causing poor or no release of Zn2+. A gradually slow release of Ni2+ was detected at a low concentration of Zn-Ni-HT/mCAC600 and Zn-Ni-HT/CAC. High concentrations of Mg2+ were observed, ranging from 104.30 to 292.60 mg/L for Zn-Ni-HT/CAC and 82.42 to 152.30 for Zn-Ni-HT/mCAC600. A low concentration of Al3+ was observed, form at 3.66 to 59.48 mg/L for Zn-Ni-HT/CAC and 3.51 to 7.55 mg/L for Zn-Ni-HT/mCAC600. Both Mg2+ and Al3+ were affected by heat activation, causing fixation and stabilization. This was not clearly observed for Ni2+. Depending upon the type of metals and their concentrations, both positive and negative effects can be found on biohydrogen fermentation. Mg2+ ion is the active site component for many enzymes, which are functioned as electron transfer [57]. Feng et al. [58] reported that the addition of 0.3 g/L Mg2+ ion concentration generated a hydrogen production rate of 256 mL H2/l, while excessive or lack of Mg2+ ion caused a decrease in the hydrogen production rate. A higher rate and yield of H2 production were found for Zn-Ni-HT/mCAC600 at 152.3 mg Mg2+/L and Zn-Ni-HT/CAC at 292.60 mg Mg2+/L. This means that this level of Mg2+ concentration did not outweigh other positive factors of biohydrogen production such as heat activation and Ni2+ concentration. This was confirmed by a higher amount of Ni2+ for Zn-Ni-HT/mCAC600 as compared to Zn-Ni-HT/CAC. It is noteworthy to mention that Ni2+ is a fundamental component of Ni-Fe hydrogenase, which can improve the hydrogen production yield."
13,Conclusion,"Biohydrogen production was enhanced by adding modified activated carbon using H3PO4 and heat treatments. The highest hydrogen production yield was observed at 600 °C (mCAC600) with a 17 % increment when compared to the control. The increment was associated with the properties of activated carbon such as surface area, pore structure, and adsorption ability. Further enhancement can be obtained through the application of HT onto mCAC600 to produce Zn-Ni-HT/mCAC600, a composite material. The maximum hydrogen production yield was 2.95 mol H2/mol of sucrose, which was nearly 12 % and 30 % higher than mCAC600 and the control, respectively. The result showed increased performance for hydrogen production rate and yield. The enhancement was due to the multiple functions of Zn-Ni-HT/mCAC600. These functions include microbial-colonization habitat, buffer capacity, adsorption abilities for unfavorable VFAs, and a slow release of beneficial metals such as Ni2+."
