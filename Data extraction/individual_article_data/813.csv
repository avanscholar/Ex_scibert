0,Introduction,"The rapid diminishing global energy and increasing environmental concerns have triggered the urgent demand in producing clean and sustainable energy resources [1,2]. Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) process provides a very promising route to convert methane-rich feedstocks (natural gas, coal, biomass) into diverse commodity chemicals via the syngas (a mixture of H2 and CO) intermediate [3–5]. Among these F-T products, higher alcohols (HA), containing 2 or more carbon atoms, show great potential as the alternative energy source owing to their vast applications including fuel additives, hydrogen carriers or precursors for major platform chemicals [6–9]. Therefore, the direct higher alcohols synthesis (HAS) from syngas leaps out of a catalytic route of prominent interest. Currently, great efforts have been devoted to optimising the catalytic system for industrial implementation. Many active metals including Cu, Fe, Co, Mo have shown good activity for this reaction. Among these elements, Co-based catalysts are most favoured over others owing to their low cost, high chain growth capability and excellent stability [10,11]. It is widely believed that HAS from syngas follows CO insertion mechanism, coupling C-O bond cleavage to form alkyl chains CnH2n* via CHx* addition and CO* insertion to produce alcohols [12–14]. Both reaction steps should occur simultaneously to boost the formation of higher alcohols. However, the active sites for CO dissociation and insertion are usually different. For Co-based catalysts, Co0 nanoparticles are always responsible to produce paraffins, whereas Coδ+ species with higher valence have been reported to be active for alcohols formation [15,16]. Normally, modification of Co catalyst with Cu or Mo can facilitate the formation of Co2C, thus promotes CO insertion rate towards the production of higher alcohols [17–20]. It is reported that the Co2C species are critical for selective HA formation in the Cu modified Co catalysts. Moreover, bimetallic carbide Co3Mo3C has been found active for CO insertion during HAS in the prepared Co-Mo catalysts [21,22]. Except for the nature of active sites, their microenvironment in the catalysts also plays important role in HAS, such as dispersion and proximity between the active centres. Highly dispersed active sites are the primary reason for efficient CO conversion, whereas low distribution of active sites in bulk Co catalysts usually leads to poor CO conversion and quick deactivation due to particle aggregation. Using supports with high surface area, such as active carbon, γ-Al2O3, could solve this problem. Additionally, the close affinity of two functional groups for CO dissociation and CO insertion is essential to promote a synergistic effect between two species for high HA output [23]. However, the impregnation method for conventional catalyst preparation always evokes randomly distribution of active sites and reduces the synergism, which remains a crucial challenge for the design of efficient catalyst for HAS. As a result, it is highly imperative to develop a rational strategy to accurately control the dispersion of active sites and their proximity for HAS reaction. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), the assembly of metal nodes and organic linkers, have attracted tremendous research interests for sustainable catalysis as a new class of porous materials [24,25]. The well-defined structure of MOFs allows the isolation of metal sites by the organic ligands. Besides, functional groups, such as polyoxometalates (HnXM12O40, where X is P, Si, etc. and M is Mo, W, etc.) can be installed in the MOF cavities due to their high porosity and the matched size of polyoxometalates molecule and MOF cage [26,27]. Moreover, the MOF-mediated synthesis (MOFMS) strategy has been a promising approach to construct novel catalysts with unrivalled performance [28–30]. MOFs-derived nanoparticles containing carbon (NP@C) possess the additional advantage that the resultant metal NPs are spatially restricted in the carbon skeleton, minimizing the sintering issues during reaction, facilitating specific reaction chemistry and enabling the tunability of catalytic activity through the confinement effects. Additionally, our previous efforts demonstrated that the successful incorporation of H4SiW12O40 in the UiO-66 can lead to a sturdy catalyst in a favourable hierarchical texture for dimethyl ether formation [31]. It inspires us to further explore the possibility to incorporate a Mo-based polyoxometalate in a Co-based MOF to achieve the homogenous arrangement of Co and Mo with intimate contact. With precisely controlled calcination in inert atmosphere, a novel catalyst can be produced with multiple active sites for HAS, such as Co0, CoMo bimetallic carbide, or Moδ+. Furthermore, the organic linkers in MOF can be transformed to a robust carbon skeleton after pyrolysis, thus providing an excellent architecture where these active centres can be in an optimum arrangement not only to keep their intimacy but also to prevent their aggregation under HAS. However, such strategy has been rarely reported for F-T synthesis, in particular for higher alcohols production. Herein, we report a novel catalyst derived from phosphomolybdic acid (PMA)-MOF composite for higher alcohols production from syngas. For this purpose, the phosphomolybdic acid (H3PMo12O40) was firstly trapped in zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) cages via a facile one-pot synthesis strategy, as can be seen in Scheme 1 . Through precise calcination, the resultant carbon supported Co/Co6Mo6C catalyst shows very high activity with exceptional stability for HAS. The strategy to use MOF as the precursor to prepare dual or multi-components may be expanded to other catalysts to improve more catalytic reaction systems."
1,Material and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Cobalt (II) nitrate trihydrate (Co(NO3)2 .6H2O, 99.9%), 2-methylimidazole (C4H6N2, 99%), phosphomolybdic acid (H3PMo12O40, 98%), and methanol (CH3OH, 99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without any further purification."
3,Preparation of MOF precursors and MOF-derived catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of MOF precursors and MOF-derived catalysts 2.2.1 Preparation of ZIF-67 and phosphomolybdic acid encapsulated ZIF-67 The pure ZIF-67 was synthesized according to previous report [32]. Typically, 3.49 g of Co(NO3)2.6H2O was dissolved in 120 mL methanol to get the solution A and 3.94 g of 2-methylimidazole was dissolved in 60 mL methanol to prepare the solution B. Then the solution B was poured into solution A and stirred for 15 min. The resultant purple mixture was kept still for 24 h at room temperature. The purple precipitate was collected after centrifuging, washing thoroughly with methanol, and drying at 80 °C overnight. The phosphomolybdic acid encapsulated ZIF-67 was prepared by following the similar procedure. However, different amounts of phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) (0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 g) were mixed with Co(NO3)2.6H2O and dissolved in methanol to form the solution A and the resultant PMA@ZIF-67 composites were denoted as PZIF-L, PZIF-M and PZIF-H based on the PMA content in low, medium and high loading, respectively. 2.2.2 Preparation of MOF derived catalyst The synthesized MOFs (ZIF-67, PZIF-L, PZIF-M and PZIF-H) were carbonized in a tube furnace under a nitrogen atmosphere. The temperature was ramped from room temperature to 600 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C/min and held for 4 h. The final black powders were referred to as Co@C, Co7.3Mo@C, Co4.7Mo@C and Co2.2Mo@C."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer equipped with Cu-Kα source (λ = 1.5406 Å). The bulk elemental composition of the prepared MOFs and final catalysts was quantified using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) on the Optima 8300 (PerkinElmer). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed in air on a TGA instrument (METTLER TOLEDO) equipped with an alumina pan. Nitrogen sorption analysis was carried out on a Tristar II 3020 instrument (Micromeritics) at the boiling point of liquid nitrogen (−196 °C). Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method was applied to estimate the specific surface area. All samples were degassed at 180 °C under vacuum overnight prior to analysis. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was recorded to evaluate the morphologies of catalysts on a FIBSEM (Zeiss Neon 40EsB) with an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out using an FEI Talos FS200X G2 electron microscopy with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted on a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD machine with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray gun. Prior to fitting, the binding energy was calibrated using C 1s at 284.6 eV."
5,Evaluation of catalysts,"2.4 Evaluation of catalysts The HAS reaction was performed on a fixed-bed reactor (Spider 3F-T instrument, AMTech, Germany). Detailed description of the experimental procedure is available elsewhere [8]. Typically, 0.2 g of prepared catalysts with particle size ranging from 53 to 150 μm were diluted thoroughly with 1.8 g of γ-Al2O3. Then the catalysts were reduced in situ with a H2/N2 flow mixture (H2/N2 = ¼, total flow rate = 100 mL/min) under 450 °C and ambient pressure. The HAS reaction was carried out at 275 °C, 3.0 MPa using total gas flow rate of 100 mL/min (H2/CO/N2 = 2/1/3). The tail gas was analysed online on an Agilent 7890/5977 GC/MS apparatus, which was equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) connected to a TDX-01 packed column to analyse H2, N2, CO, CH4 and CO2 and a mass spectrometry detector (MSD) connected to an HP-5 column for measuring the organic products. The mass transfer line was held at 200 °C to avoid product condensation. The CO conversion and product selectivity were calculated on the molar carbon basis."
6,Results and discussions,
7,Characterizations of prepared MOF composites,"3.1 Characterizations of prepared MOF composites We developed PMA modulated ZIF-67 precursors by adding different amounts of PMA into the precursor mixture. This strategy allows for homogeneously dispersed PMA to enter into the ZIF-67 channels without jeopardizing the structural and compositional features of both ZIF-67 and PMA clusters [33]. Here, the representative samples ZIF-67, PZIF-M and PZIF-H were precisely characterized due to their vast difference in composition. Elemental analysis evidenced that PZIF-M and PZIF-H contain 12.7% and 23.6% (by weight) of PMA, as shown in Table 1 . The successful formation of PZIF samples was verified via different characterization techniques. The XRD patterns of all prepared MOFs (Fig. 1 -A), for instance, are identical with the simulated ZIF-67 patterns (CCDC#671073), indicating the intact framework of ZIF-67 after PMA modulation. The lack of crystalline PMA domains clearly confirms that the PMA clusters were fully enclosed in the well-developed ZIF-67 pores. N2 adsorption/desorption analysis (Fig. 1-B) provides another convincing evidence of PMA trapping in ZIF-67. The pristine ZIF-67 provides the largest BET surface area of 1960 m2/g. The PZIF-M and PZIF-H with increased PMA loading remain highly porous, with clearly reduced SBET values of 1655 and 1035 m2/g, respectively. It is worth to mention that the measured surface area for PZIFs is smaller than the calculated value when PMA was assumed to be physically mixed with ZIF-67. This is a logic observation as the PMA molecules occupy part of ZIF-67 cages and make the final composite less accessible for N2 (more detailed explanation ca be found in supporting information). Furthermore, TGA results under air atmosphere (Fig. 1-C) reveal that the weight loss of ZIF-67 between 50 and 600 °C was 65%, much higher than that of PZIF-M (58%) and PZIF-H (51%). This clearly demonstrates the effect of PMA trapping on the compositional feature of ZIF-67. To ensure the intact architecture of prepared MOFs, SEM and TEM analysis were also employed, as shown in Fig. 1-D and Figure S1. All synthesized MOFs are rhombic dodecahedral in shape, typical morphology of ZIF-67. Moreover, the ordered polyhedral crystals with 6 exposed [110] facets demonstrate high symmetry with smooth surfaces [34]."
8,Characterizations of MOF composites derived catalysts,"3.2 Characterizations of MOF composites derived catalysts The above discussions corroborate that the PMA molecules are successfully anchored into the ZIF-67 cages via the facile one-pot synthesis method. After pyrolysis in the N2 atmosphere, the MOF precursors were decomposed and new species emerged, as observed in XRD patterns in Fig. 2 -A. All the characteristic peaks for ZIF-67 and PZIFs disappear after calcination at 600 °C. For the pure Co containing sample Co@C, only Co0 phase is presented with three peaks located at 44.3°, 51.6° and 75.9° corresponding to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0) and (2 2 0) planes of metallic cobalt (JCPDS 01-015-0806). For another two Mo containing samples Co4.7Mo@C and Co2.2Mo@C, it's interesting to find that a novel bimetallic carbide Co6Mo6C was formed along with extra Co0 phase. The peaks located at 2θ = 32.7°, 35.8°, 40.5°, 43.0°, 47.1°, 60.4°, 65.6° and 73.6° are indexed to the (4 0 0), (3 3 1), (4 2 2), (5 1 1), (4 4 0), (5 5 1), (7 3 1) and (8 2 2) planes of Co6Mo6C (JCPDS 01-080-0338). Especially, as the Co/Mo ratio decreased from 4.7 for Co4.7Mo@C to 2.2 for Co2.2Mo@C, strengthened Co6Mo6C peaks and weakened Co0 peaks are observed, indicative of enhanced Co6Mo6C formation and less Co0 content in the catalyst. No peaks corresponding to monometallic carbide (i.e., Co2C and MoxC) can be observed. This is a striking observation because the formation of bimetallic carbides is generally favoured through the interaction of cobalt molybdate (CoMoO4) with a carbon source at a higher temperature (800–1000 °C) [35]. The corresponding mechanism behind this phenomenon is described as follows. The encapsulation of PMA in ZIF-67 leads to the homogeneous C, Co and Mo elemental distribution with optimum arrangement maintaining not only the required intimacy but also proper close distance to prevent aggregation via the MOF framework. During the pyrolysis step in N2 atmosphere, 2-methylimidazole molecules in MOF framework were transformed to carbon skeleton with reducing gas release, whereas the PMA will be converted initially to MoO3. After the decomposition step, the formed carbon will react with adjacent Mo and Co, leading to the formation of Co6Mo6C. The same phenomenon was also observed in the previous report [36]. Based on ICP analysis, the molar content of Co is 4.7 and 2.2 times higher than that of Mo in PZIF-M and PZIF-H. Thus, the excessive Co was reduced to metallic Co0 nanoparticles simultaneously. To further verify the existence of Co6Mo6C, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was applied to Co4.7Mo@C sample derived from PZIF-M precursor MOF. The survey spectrum verifies the coexistence of C, N, P, Co and Mo with the corresponding peaks located at binding energy of 284, 398, 134, 779 and 231 eV (Fig. 2-B). The high-resolution Co 2p peak (Fig. 2-C) can be deconvoluted into eight sub-peaks with four components corresponding to Co0, Co2+, Co3+ and satellite peaks. The peaks located at 793.4 and 778.2 eV are assigned to metallic Co (Co0). Co2+ is observed with binding energy peaks at 796.4 eV for 2p 1/2 and 780.4 eV for 2p 3/2, indicative of the presence of Co6Mo6C. Co3+ is also shown at 798.9 and 783.0 eV, which was formed due to passivation upon air exposure [35]. In the case of Mo 3d spectrum (Fig. 2-D), after curve deconvolution, the peaks located at 229.8 and 228.5 eV are ascribed to Mo2+ 3d3/2 and Mo2+ 3d5/2 of C-Mo bond from cobalt molybdenum carbide [22,36]. Other four peaks at 232.2 eV / 235.4 eV (3d3/2 / 3d5/2) and 233.5 eV / 236.8 eV (3d3/2 / 3d5/2) are assigned to Mo4+ and Mo6+, which are also due to the surface oxidation. The XPS results of Co 2d and Mo 3d solidly confirm the formation of cobalt molybdenum carbide through the facile pyrolysis of heteropolyacid-MOF composite. The C 1s peak can be fitted into five peaks, indexing to C-C (284.6 eV), C-P (285.3 eV), C-N (286.0 eV), C-O (287.3 eV) and Metal-C (283.9 eV), as shown in Figure S2-A [37,38]. The spectrum of N 1s (Figure S2-B) can be deconvoluted into 3 peaks at 398.5, 299.5 and 400.9 eV, corresponding to pyridinic N, pyrrolic N and graphitic N, respectively, suggesting the successful incorporation of N into the carbon framework [39]. In the high-resolution spectrum (P 2p peaks in Figure S2-C), except the P-O bond (134.2 eV) and P-C bond (133.2 eV), P-Metal bond (P-Co or P-Mo) was also formed, peaking at 129.8 eV [36]. Although beyond the detection by XRD, the existence of metal phosphide is clearly revealed from the XPS results. This can be attributed to the unique structure of PMA molecule, where one P atom is closely surrounded by twelve Mo atoms. Thus, MoP can be easily formed during the thermal treatment process. As reported elsewhere, the MoP or CoP was also found to be able to improve the catalytic activity and selectivity of C2+ alcohols [40,41]. Thus, the prepared Co4.7Mo@C catalyst might exhibit exceptional activity for HAS. With the formation of bimetallic carbide, Co4.7Mo@C exhibits slight difference with Co@C in morphology. Co@C has retained the rhombic dodecahedral morphology and nanocage size of ZIF-67, with a rough surface as shown in SEM and TEM images (Fig. 3 -A). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) of Co@C (Fig. 3-A3) shows an interplanar distance of 0.177 nm, corresponding to the (2 0 0) plane of Co0 [42]. However, the SEM image for Co4.7Mo@C reveals that the nanocage of PZIF-M exhibit severe shrinkage after carbonization at 600 °C, leaving distorted surface with much smaller nanocages (Fig. 3-B1). This is because that the oxygen atoms from PMA inside the MOF cages consume larger amount of carbon in the ZIF-67 during pyrolysis, rendering indentation in the structure. The HRTEM image (Fig. 3-B3) provides further evidence for the formation of bimetallic carbide and metallic Co. Along with Co0 (2 0 0) plane, the (5 1 1) and (3 3 1) plane for Co6Mo6C are also observed with the lattice spacing of 0.210 and 0.250 nm, respectively [35]. It is also observed that Co0 is closely adjacent to Co6Mo6C, which promotes an intimate and extensive interface. Moreover, the EDS mapping further manifests the homogeneous dispersion of Co, Mo, C, N and P in the formed polyhedrons (Fig. 3-C). The porosities and specific surface areas of ZIF-derived catalysts were also altered sharply with the Mo modulation, as investigated by N2 adsorption/desorption measurement. The results are shown in Figure S4 and Table 1. A vast decrease of N2 uptake volume is clearly observed with the increasing amount of Mo in the final catalyst. Co@C, which was developed from thermal treatment of pure ZIF-67, has the largest N2 uptake with a surface area reached up to 334 m2/g. In the case of Mo containing samples Co4.7Mo@C and Co2.2Mo@C, they own smaller N2 uptake and the corresponding surface areas have substantially decreased to 132 and 38 m2/g, respectively. This is consistent with the morphology changes for both samples, that the oxygen would take away more carbon atoms in the MOF and make the resultant catalysts less porous. Similarly, the pore volume values of Co4.7Mo@C and Co2.2Mo@C are 0.08 and 0.05 cm3/g, respectively, much lower than Co@C (0.13 cm3/g)."
9,Catalytic performance for higher alcohols synthesis,"3.3 Catalytic performance for higher alcohols synthesis To investigate the impact of Mo modification on higher alcohols formation, herein, we have tested these ZIF-derived catalysts for HAS at 275 °C and 3.0 MPa with a GHSV of 15000 mLsyngas/gcat.h. The catalytic performance was evaluated in terms of CO conversion, product selectivity, alcohol distribution and space time yield, as shown in Fig. 4 and Table S1. The pure Co sample Co@C under the reaction conditions exhibited the lowest CO conversion of 22.2% with a CO conversion rate of 92 μmol/gmetal.h. CH4 and others (mainly hydrocarbons) were the dominant products. The corresponding selectivity towards alcohols was only 8.6%. Moreover, methanol accounts for 52.5 wt % of total alcohols, with a space-time-yield (STY) of 28.6 mg/gcat.h. As for Mo containing samples, for example, the Co4.7Mo@C catalyst demonstrated a remarkable CO conversion of 48%, which is 2.2 times higher than Co@C. Despite the slightly lower BET surface area, the CO conversion rate of Co4.7Mo@C reached a higher level of 174 μmol/gmetal.h. In the meantime, the alcohols selectivity significantly increased to 11.9% and CH4 selectivity was significantly reduced. A high C2+OH portion in total alcohols (80.3 wt %) is obtained, signifying that methanol formation was greatly suppressed. Moreover, the C2+OH STY was greatly raised to 99 mg/gcat.h, which is 3.8 times higher than that of Co@C (26 mg/gcat.h). However, the Co2.2Mo@C exhibits slightly inferior performance. The corresponding C2+OH fraction and STY were 73% and 41.6 mg/gcat.h, respectively, at a CO conversion of 37%. As identified by XRD results, Co2.2Mo@C contains the largest fraction of Co6Mo6C and the lowset content of Co0. The catalyst of Co7.3Mo@C containing the least amount of Co6Mo6C exhibited slightly higher activity than Co2.2Mo@C in HAS, with a CO conversion of 42.6% and a C2+OH STY of 75.7 mg/gcat.h. Therefore, we envision that a synergetic effect exists between Co and Co6Mo6C and the equilibrium of two species would shift the reaction toward higher alcohols formation. Additionally, linear Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) distributions for the alcohol products of all three catalysts are observed, suggesting that the higher alcohols formation on these catalysts follows same mechanism (Figure S5), and the carbon chain growth possibly occurs mainly on the metallic Co0 component providing the active centres for CO dissociation and hydrogenation to form CHx* monomer and following chain propagation via CnH2n* formation [43]. Nevertheless, the bimetallic carbide Co6Mo6C undoubtedly promotes the carbon chain propagation ability towards higher alcohols. The calculated chain growth probability (α) to alcohols over Co4.7Mo@C and Co2.2Mo@C catalysts are 0.67 and 0.64, respectively. Both values exceed that for Co@C (0.56). Therefore, the essence of Co6Mo6C in Co4.7Mo@C and Co2.2Mo@C catalysts could be rationalized by providing the active centres for CO nondissociative adsorption, coupling the CnH2n* formed on the Co0 part at the Co0/Co6Mo6C interface to produce oxygenate intermediates, which undergo further hydrogenation to produce the final alcohols. To gain further insight about the role of the bimetallic carbide Co6Mo6C in HAS, the counterpart sample Co6Mo6C@C was fabricated by etching away the metallic Co0 particles in Co4.7Mo@C using 1 M HCl solution. The corresponding Co/Mo ratio dropped to 1.18 after etching treatment based on the ICP analysis, close to the theoretical value of Co6Mo6C. Under the same reaction conditions, the Co6Mo6C@C only exhibits a CO conversion of 3% and a C2+OH STY of 5.5 mg/gcat.h, much lower than that of Co4.7Mo@C. This remarkable difference in catalytic performance demonstrates that sole Co6Mo6C phase exhibits poor activity for HAS reaction, which is in good agreement with previous report that metal carbides are usually less active than the corresponding metals [44]. It is widely known that the HAS process requires different active sites to fulfill C-C chain growth and CO insertion processes simultaneously. Based on the catalytic properties and corresponding performance, it is conclusive that prepared Mo-containing catalysts serve as nanoreactors, where the individual components of Co0 and Co6Mo6C encapsulated in the carbon matrix are responsible for different steps in the relay reactions of higher alcohols production from syngas, as illustrated in Fig. 5 . Metal Co firstly dissociatively adsorbs CO to produce CHx*, followed by chain propagation to promote the CnH2n* intermediate. The short distance between Co0 and Co6Mo6C provides more feasibility for the fast transfer of CnH2n* from Co0 to Co6Mo6C phase. Meanwhile, the Co6Mo6C would assist in the nondissociative adsorption of CO to produce the active CO*, which inserts in the adjacent CnH2n* species to give the acyl intermediate CnH2nCO* and then hydrogenate to produce the final Cn+1OH alcohols. A recent study revealed that CO* insertion is the rate-determining step for C2+ oxygenates production [45]. Thus, the integration of Co and Co-Mo carbide will shift the reaction towards higher alcohols formation, rendering larger output. Indeed, monometallic carbides (Co2C, Mo2C, etc.) are well acknowledged to exhibit typical noble-metal-like features in the hydrogenation process and water gas shift (WGS) reaction [46,47]. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations proved that CO molecules can be adsorbed associatively on Co2C (111) and then insert in the CH2 intermediates [43]. Likewise, the formed bimetallic carbide Co6Mo6C in our experiment is very likely to perform the similar function as Co2C. Moreover, the above discussion proves that the relative concentration of Co and Co6Mo6C on the catalyst surface is pivotal for the catalytic performance in HAS reaction. The catalyst Co4.7Mo@C with Co/Mo ratio of 4.7 exhibits the largest higher alcohol formation because it offers the best compromise between chain growth and CO insertion. However, the larger Co fraction in catalyst Co7.3Mo@C produces more CH4 due to enhanced CO dissociation (Table S1), whereas the highest concentration of carbide component in Co2.2Mo@C has resulted in the slightly lower CO conversion with the largest CO2 selectivity owing to the enhanced water gas shift reaction. The WGS reaction would change the H2/CO ratio and contribute to the decrease in CO insertion and carbon chain growth [8]. Despite the high activity and selectivity to higher alcohols, long-term stability plays vital role concerning the industrial implementation of PZIF derived catalysts. The time-on-stream evolution of CO conversion and alcohols selectivity for Co4.7Mo@C catalysts is summarized in Fig. 4-D. Significantly, superior stability is achieved in a 100 h of time-on-stream evaluation. After 20 h of reaction, the catalytic system reached the steady state, CO conversion ranging between 42% and 48% with alcohols selectivity above 10%. The outstanding stability is ascribed to the homogenously dispersed Co and Co6Mo6C components on the formed carbon skeletons after pyrolysis in N2 atmosphere. XRD analysis of the spent catalysts (Figure S6) clearly reveals the fact that Co6Mo6C can endure the harsh reaction conditions without transforming to other unfavourable phases of MoxC or CoMo alloy. Moreover, the catalytic performance achieved in our experiment is comparable with the relevant results from previous literature as shown in Fig. 6 and Table S2, demonstrating the high prospects of MOFs derived catalysts for large-scale application. To date, there are only a few reports about the MOF-derived catalysts for HAS. Wang et al. reported the K-promoted Co3O4 catalysts derived from ZIF-67 exhibited a high selectivity to C2+ oxygenates in virtue of the homogenous distribution of Co nanoparticles and formation of Co2C species under reaction conditions [57]. Unfortunately, the CO conversion at 270 °C is below 1% and the stability is unknown. Compared with this monometallic catalyst, the Co-Mo bimetallic catalysts have shown great advantages in catalytic activity and chain growth probability in the formed Co/Co6Mo6C@C nanoreactors. The close affinity of Co0 and Co6Mo6C ensures fast transfer of reaction intermediates and thus high production of higher alcohols."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, we report a novel MOF-assisted strategy for developing well confined Co-Mo bifunctional catalyst with unique polyhedral nanocages as a highly active catalyst for HAS. This strategy relies on the confinement effect and in situ carbonization of the ZIF-67 composites (PZIFs) consisting of ZIF-67 host and PMA (H3PMo12O40) guest resided in the nanopores, which enables close contact between C, Co and Mo source and facilitates the simultaneous formation of cobalt molybdenum carbide (Co6Mo6C) and metal Co (Co0) nanoparticles embedded in the N doped carbon matrix after pyrolysis in N2 atmosphere. Under HAS conditions of 275 °C and 3.0 MPa, the as-prepared Co4.7Mo@C stemmed from PZIF-M exhibited remarkable activity for higher alcohols formation from syngas with a CO conversion of 48% and C2+OH STY of 99 mg/gcat.h, much better than its counterpart Co@C or Co6Mo6C catalyst. Benefiting from the protection of resultant N-doped carbon scaffold, this catalyst displays exceptional stability, and no catalyst deactivation was observed during the 100 h long-term stability test. Moreover, the relative content of Co and Co6Mo6C in the nanoreactors plays crucial role for higher alcohols production. Higher fraction of Co6Mo6C in Co2.2Mo@C derived from PZIF-H with higher Mo content enhances water-gas shift reaction and prohibits the formation of higher alcohols. Correlating the nature of Co@C, Co4.7Mo@C and Co2.2Mo@C and their corresponding catalytic performance in HAS, a strong synergism between Co and Co6Mo6C species in the catalyst is well defined, where Co0 is mainly for CO dissociation and carbon chain growth, and Co6Mo6C is responsible for CO nondissocative adsorption and subsequent CO insertion to produce HA. Moreover, our results open new opportunities for rational design of bifunctional catalyst for HAS with optimized activity. By tuning the types of MOF, such as Fe- or Ni-MOF, highly porous FexMoxC or NixMoxC can also be developed which might be exclusively active for HAS."
