0,Introduction,"Onboard processing of liquid fuels is regarded as the most promising method of supplying hydrogen to proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) mounted in a vehicle [1]. Among the various processes that have been proposed for onboard hydrogen generation from liquid fuels, such as primary alcohols, gasoline and diesel etc., autothermal reforming of methanol, or oxidative methanol reforming (OMR), is regarded as the leading candidate for fuel-cell-driven automobiles [2–4]. The following advantages of the OMR process have been identified: • sufficient energy density of methanol; • low or zero sulfur content of methanol; • easy availability and safe handling/storage of methanol; • low reaction temperature and low formation of CO; • rapid startup of the reformer and fast response to load changes; • simplicity and compactness of the system. The OMR reaction is regarded as a combination of partial oxidation (POM, Eq. (1)) with steam reforming (SRM, Eq. (2)) at such a ratio that the overall reaction is thermally neutral or modestly exothermic. In reality, the OMR reaction cannot be totally heat-balanced (ΔH°=0) because of heat loss. An OMR reaction that is almost heat-balanced is illustrated in Eq. (3): (1) CH3OH(l)+1/2O2 →CO2 +2H2 (ΔH°=−154.8kJ/mol) (2) CH3OH(l)+H2O(l)→CO2 +3H2 (ΔH°=+131kJ/mol) (3) CH3OH(l)+1/2H2O(l)+1/4O2 →CO2 +5/2H2 (ΔH°=−12kJ/mol) Although the notable benefits that are listed above are features of the OMR process for producing hydrogen, literature studies on this reaction are limited in number. Huang and Wang [5,6] first reported the effect of the addition of O2 to the SRM reaction. After they studied the kinetics of the OMR reaction over Cu–Zn–Al catalysts, they proposed that the rate of the combined OMR process could be calculated by the sum of the rates of the SRM and POM reactions. Reitz et al. [7,8] reported that the catalytic performance of a Cu–Zn–Al catalyst was strongly dependent on the copper oxidation state. Cu0, Cu+ and Cu2+ species could be detected on the active catalyst surface. Recent studies by Velu et al. [9,10] and by Murcia-Mascarós et al. [11] on Cu–Zn based catalysts revealed high activity for methanol conversion and high selectivity and efficiency for hydrogen production. The decomposition of precipitated hydrotalcite-like precursors was used by those authors to prepare more homogeneous and more stable catalysts. However, the vulnerability to temperature (e.g. 270°C) of Cu–Zn based catalysts is a barrier to its application in the OMR process for hydrogen production in on-board PEMFCs for automobiles. In the search to develop catalysts that work at higher temperatures (e.g. >330°C) for the OMR process, the Pd/ZnO catalyst system could become an alternative to Cu–Zn based catalysts. Takezawa et al. [12–14] first reported that Pd/ZnO exhibits high activity and selectivity towards the SRM reaction. The H2CO and methylformate species were supposed to be involved in the SRM process, and its high selectivity could be related to the formation of a Pd–Zn alloy on the catalyst. Similar catalytic performances were recently confirmed by Chin et al. [15]. On the other hand, Cubeiro and Fierro [16] have studied the POM reaction on Pd/ZnO. The formation of a Pd–Zn alloy was also confirmed on their samples after reduction in hydrogen above 300°C. A high yield of hydrogen was obtained when water was not added to the reaction. The application of Pd/ZnO in the OMR process seems to be very promising. However, few experimental data under real OMR conditions are available in the literature. The effects of preparation and Pd loading on the catalyst are still not systematically studied. The aim of the present work is to investigate the performances of Pd/ZnO catalysts prepared by different methods with varying Pd loadings in the OMR reaction under practical conditions for commercial application."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Pd/ZnO catalysts were prepared by either impregnation (IMP) of ZnO supports with an aqueous solution of Pd(NO3)2 or the coprecipitation (CP) of Zn(NO3)2 +Pd(NO3)2 with 2M NaOH+0.5M Na2CO3 aqueous solutions at room temperature. For samples where the Pd loading exceeded 25%, 1M Na2CO3 was employed to replace the 2M NaOH+0.5M Na2CO3 mixed solution. An aqueous solution of Pd(NO3)2 from Aldrich (10% Pd(NO3)2 in 10% HNO3) was used for the impregnated and coprecipitated samples (CP series with Pd loading of 1–30%). The amount of loading was designated as the Pd weight percentage in Pd/ZnO without further notification. For higher Pd loadings of 25–45% (HCP series), a homemade, partially hydrolyzed aqueous solution of Pd(NO3)2 (0.017g/mL in 1% HNO3) was used. After precipitation, the slurry was aged at 50–60°C for 2h. The precursor was isolated by filtration, washed thoroughly with deionized water, then dried at 80°C overnight. The analytical grade Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, NaOH and Na2CO3 that we used were supplied by Wako Chemicals. ZnO powder from Sakai Co. was used for the preparation of IMP samples with Pd loadings of 1–10%. Another series of samples (IWI series) containing 3.5% Pd was prepared by impregnation of different ZnO supports with the Pd(NO3)2 solution from Aldrich using an incipient wetness technique. The ZnO supports were prepared by coprecipitation of Zn(NO3)2 with Na2CO3 or H2C2O4·2H2O (Wako Chemicals) in aqueous solution. The resulting suspension was aged at 55°C for either 30min or 3h. The filtrated solid was washed thoroughly with deionized water, then dried at 105°C overnight. The precursors were then decomposed and calcined at different temperatures. The catalysts were named according to their preparation method and their designated loading amount of Pd. For example, the sample prepared by the IMP method with 3.5% Pd loading was named as IMP3.5, and the sample prepared by the CP method with 15% Pd was named as CP15 and so on. All of the samples were finally calcined at 450°C for 2h and crushed to 0.15–0.25mm for the activity test."
3,Catalytic reaction,"2.2 Catalytic reaction The catalytic reactions were carried out in a conventional-flow fixed-bed quartz reactor of 6mm ID that was charged with 0.3g of catalyst at atmospheric pressure. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was reduced in situ in a stream of 20% H2 in N2 (160mL/min) at 400°C for 2h. After the catalyst was cooled down to the reaction temperature, a methanol+water mixture (H2O/CH3OH molar ratio (S/C)=1.5) was fed into a vaporizer by a liquid pump at a rate of 0.44g/min and conveyed into the reactor by N2, which acted as both the carrier gas and an internal standard for product analysis. The N2 flow was adjusted precisely by a STEC mass flow controller to a rate of 120mL/min. The O2 was adjusted by another mass flow controller and was fed into the reactor at a rate of 16.7mL/min, which gave an O2/CH3OH ratio (O2/C) of 0.1. The above conditions determined that there was a methanol weight hourly space velocity (WMHSV) of ∼47h−1 and a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of ∼110,000h−1. After the reaction, the product gases were passed through a cold-water (5°C)-circulated condenser followed by a water-scrubber that was kept in iced water. The scrubbed gases were analyzed on-line using a Shimadzu GC-8A gas chromatograph automatic analysis system equipped with Parapak-Q and Molecular sieve 13X columns. Unless otherwise mentioned, the initial activity was evaluated from the data collected between 1 and 3h of reaction time on stream. The gas yield (moles of CO2 +CO produced per mole of methanol fed) was used as a measure to compare the catalyst activity. The reaction selectivity was defined as moles of CO2 in the products per mole of CO2 +CO formed."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded on a Rigaku RINT1100 diffractometer using Cu Kα (λ =0.15406nm) radiation. The 2θ angles that were scanned ranged from 10° to 80°. The Scherrer equation (D h k l = Kλ/β cos(θ), K =0.94) was applied to the diffraction peaks of ZnO(101) and Pd–Zn(111) to calculate the corresponding crystal size, based on the line broadening. However, these results are only used to give a relative comparison of the mean crystal size. The specific area of the CP samples (CP and HCP series) was calculated by applying the BET method to the nitrogen adsorption isotherms obtained at liquid nitrogen temperature on outgassed samples at 110°C using an automatic Quantachrome AUTOSORB1-MP adsorption instrument. The average pore diameter was determined by applying the BJH method."
5,Results,
6,X-ray diffraction,"3.1 X-ray diffraction 3.1.1 ZnO support and IWI samples Different ZnO supports derived from the decomposition of Zn–oxalate and Zn–hydroxycarbonate precursors at different temperatures were characterized by the XRD technique. Fig. 1 a shows the XRD patterns of the precursors dried at 105°C. The aging time of the precipitates caused no significant differences in the XRD patterns. The precipitation of Zn(NO3)2 by an H2C2O4·2H2O aqueous solution produced well-crystallized ZnC2O4·nH2O (n ≤2), and the precipitation of Zn(NO3)2 by Na2CO3 produced a Zn–hydroxycarbonate mixture mainly consisting of hydrozincite and zinc carbonate hydroxide hydrate. The decomposition of these precursors generated well-crystallized ZnO, as illustrated in Fig. 1b. The ZnO that was derived from the decomposition of Zn–oxalate gave sharper diffraction peaks than that derived from Zn–hydroxycarbonate. The crystal sizes of all the prepared samples were calculated by applying the Scherrer equation to ZnO(101) diffraction data at a 2θ angle of 36.3°. The data are shown in Fig. 2 . It is clear that, after calcination at 400°C, ZnO samples from both the hydroxycarbonate and the oxalate have very similar crystal sizes of about 15nm. However, calcination at higher temperature greatly increased the size of the ZnO crystallites. The temperature-dependence of the crystal size for Zn–oxalate-derived ZnO is much stronger than for the Zn–hydroxycarbonate derived material. Using a longer aging time for the Zn–hydroxycarbonate precursor exerted a slight but noticeable enhancement on the crystal size of the calcined samples. After 3.5% Pd was loaded on the ZnO, the XRD patterns of the IWI-series samples showed a weak diffraction when 2θ was around 42.1°; this was attributed to the PdO(110) in the samples. The crystal size of the ZnO supports was increased to some extent after impregnation and calcination at 450°C. The XRD patterns of several spent IWI samples after the activity tests are illustrated in Fig. 3 . All of the samples showed new diffraction lines at 2θ of 41.2° and 44.2°, which were indexed to the diffraction of the Pd–Zn(111) and the Pd–Zn(200), respectively [17]. It is clear that the Pd–Zn alloy which formed on Zn–oxalate-derived ZnO yielded a more intense diffraction than that which formed on Zn–hydroxycarbonate-derived ZnO. The size of the Pd–Zn crystallites on the Zn–oxalate-derived ZnO was calculated to be around 25nm in the direction perpendicular to the (111) plane. 3.1.2 Impregnated (IMP) samples The XRD patterns of freshly prepared and spent IMP samples are shown in Fig. 4 . No extra peaks other than those due to ZnO could be observed with IMP1. The diffraction lines from PdO in freshly-prepared samples and the lines from the Pd–Zn alloy in spent samples appeared at Pd loadings exceeding 2%. Though they are initially broad and weak, the PdO diffractions from the freshly-prepared samples became stronger with increasing Pd loading. A variation in the intensity of the ZnO diffraction lines was also noticed. From the calculated crystal size, based on the broadening of the (101) diffraction, it can be seen that the ZnO crystallites become bigger with increasing Pd loading and the size leveled off when the Pd loading was over 5% (Fig. 5 ). After the activity test, the size of the ZnO crystallites was noticed to decrease, and it remained the same as that of the original ZnO support. However, the intensities of the diffractions from the Pd–Zn alloy increased noticeably with increasing Pd loading. Bigger crystallites of the Pd–Zn alloy were formed at higher Pd loading, as indicated in Fig. 5. 3.1.3 Coprecipitated (CP) samples At Pd loadings below 15%, the XRD patterns (Fig. 6 a) of the freshly prepared CP samples were very similar to those of the IMP samples. Diffraction from PdO appeared at Pd loadings exceeding 3.5% and increased in intensity with increasing loading of Pd. However, for CP20 and CP30, the diffractions from both PdO and ZnO became much more diffuse. The diffractions from the Pd–Zn alloys of the spent samples (Fig. 6b) were broadened, and were quite different from those of the spent IMP samples. The calculated size of Pd–Zn crystallites (Fig. 7 ) was about 8–15nm, and no obvious variation was observed at Pd loadings above 10%. However, when the Pd loading was 5–8%, the Pd–Zn crystal size seemed somewhat larger than it was for other samples with lower or higher Pd loadings. The crystal sizes of the ZnO for both the freshly prepared and the spent samples were very similar, varying between 12 and 18nm, which is much smaller than the IMP samples. The XRD patterns of the HCP samples are shown in Fig. 8 . The diffractions from the ZnO became weaker with increasing loading of Pd. However, no clear change was observed for the PdO diffractions. After the reaction, the intensity of the diffractions from the Pd–Zn alloy increased with increasing Pd loading, and the diffractions from the ZnO became weaker. At a Pd loading of 45% (HCP45), no diffraction due to the ZnO can be observed. It is worth pointing out that the diffractions from elemental Pd at 2θ of 40.2° for Pd(111) and 46.8° for Pd(200) were observed for HCP37.5 and HCP45. The calculated crystal sizes of Pd–Zn alloy and ZnO supports are also illustrated in Fig. 7. The freshly-prepared samples had very similar ZnO crystal sizes to those of the CP samples, but the crystal sizes of the Pd–Zn alloy (30nm) and the ZnO support (20–25nm) in the spent HCP samples were much larger than that of the CP samples."
7,BET measurement,3.2 BET measurement The surface area and average pore diameter of the CP as well as the HCP samples are plotted in Fig. 9 as a function of Pd loading. The surface area of the CP samples tends to increase with increasing Pd loading above 3.5%. It is obvious that CP20 and CP30 have much larger surface areas than the other CP samples. All of the HCP samples exhibited a similar surface area of about 75m2/g. The average pore diameter decreased with increased Pd loading for both the CP and the HCP samples.
8,Catalytic activity,"3.3 Catalytic activity 3.3.1 IWI samples The OMR reaction was carried out at 250°C with S/C and O2/C ratios of 1.5 and 0.1, respectively. All of the IWI samples showed high activities towards the OMR reaction. The best performances were obtained when the Zn–hydroxycarbonate-derived ZnO was used as the support. This had been calcined at 400°C, while its precursor had been aged at 55°C for 30min. Its gas yield reached 66% with a selectivity of 91.7%. The formation rate of hydrogen reached 700μmol/(g-cats) and its concentration in the products was 72.5%, on a dry- and nitrogen-free basis. Variations in the gas yield with the calcination temperature of the ZnO support are illustrated in Fig. 10 a. The corresponding selectivity of the CO2 formation is shown in Fig. 10b. Samples prepared with ZnO derived from the decomposition of Zn–hydroxycarbonate at lower temperature showed higher activities, and the corresponding selectivity results were higher than those of the Zn–oxalate-derived samples. Calcination at 600°C always gave a lower gas yield and higher CO formation. The longer aging time of the precipitates of the Zn–hydroxycarbonate also seems to give lower activities and higher CO formation. 3.3.2 IMP samples Fig. 11 a illustrates the variation of the gas yield and the selectivity with reaction time on stream for several IMP samples. Within a reaction time of 4h, no decrease in gas yield was observed. Nevertheless, the selectivity was decreased, albeit moderately. The variation in the catalytic performances of the IMP samples with different Pd loadings is illustrated in Fig. 12 . The gas yield was increased greatly at low Pd loading, but assumed an essentially constant value at above 5%. On the other hand, the selectivity increased with increasing Pd loading and also leveled off at a Pd loading of 5%. 3.3.3 CP and HCP samples The catalytic performances with reaction time on stream for several CP samples are illustrated in Fig. 11b. No decrease in either the gas yield or the selectivity was observed. All the CP samples appeared to be rather stable in the OMR reaction under the examined conditions. The gas yield on CP6.5 was 68% at a selectivity of 92%. The dependence of the gas yield and selectivity on the Pd loading for the CP samples is also shown in Fig. 12. It is clear that the highly active samples generally correspond with high selectivity, and that higher activity was obtained with higher Pd loading. Nevertheless, the variation in the catalytic performance with Pd loading does not occur in a monotonous way. The gas yield and selectivity increased sharply with increasing Pd loading below 5%, but maintained a constant value at 5–10% Pd loadings. When the Pd loading was above 10%, the gas yield increased again and reached a maximum at 20%. Any further increase in Pd loading reduced the gas yield. By contrast, the selectivity increased monotonously and moderately at 10–30% Pd loadings. On CP30, the selectivity reached 98% at a gas yield of around 75%. The catalytic performance values of Pd/ZnO at Pd loadings exceeding 30% were obtained for the HCP samples, as illustrated in Fig. 12. Comparing these with the CP samples, the gas yield on the HCP samples was low, but high selectivity was maintained for HCP25, HCP30 and HCP37.5, where the selectivity was 95–97% with gas yields of over 65%. Further increasing the amount of Pd on the ZnO (HCP45) abruptly reduced the gas yield and selectivity to less than 50%."
9,"Catalytic performances of CP30 in SRM, POM and OMR reactions","3.4 Catalytic performances of CP30 in SRM, POM and OMR reactions To understand more about the OMR reaction on Pd/ZnO catalysts, we evaluated CP30 further under various reaction conditions. The temperature dependence of the SRM, POM and OMR reactions was examined; the results are shown in Fig. 13 . The gas yield from the SRM and OMR reactions increased linearly with increasing reaction temperature. In contrast, the gas yield from the POM reaction only increased slightly at temperatures between 240 and 310°C. Since no gaseous oxygen was detected in the product gases, the conversion of oxygen was close to 100% at all of the temperatures that we examined. The selectivity on CP30 for the SRM and OMR reactions was high and almost independent of the reaction temperature. Nevertheless, the selectivity for the POM reaction decreased considerably from 82 to 67% at temperatures between 240 and 310°C. The effect of the O2/C ratio on the OMR reaction is shown in Fig. 14 a. The gas yield and the selectivity varied inversely with increasing O2/C ratio. A gas yield of close to 100% can be obtained when the O2/C ratio is higher than 0.2. The gas yield and the selectivity of the OMR reaction were also strongly dependent on S/C, as shown in Fig. 14b. The gas yield and selectivity increased greatly as S/C increased up to 1.0, but then leveled off for higher S/C ratios. The temperature dependence of the gas yield and the selectivity at different values of S/C are shown in Fig. 15 . The gas yield increased sharply with increasing reaction temperature when S/C exceeded 0.5. At lower S/C ratios, it only increased slightly with temperature. In contrast, the selectivity showed a strong temperature dependence when S/C was below 0.5, and remained almost constant at higher S/C ratios."
10,Discussion,"As stated in Section 1, Pd/ZnO is a good catalyst in SRM and POM reactions. It is also expected to perform well in the OMR reaction. However, little experimental data on the OMR reaction is available in the literature for this catalyst. Our results confirmed its applicability in the OMR reaction, and excellent performance was achieved with Pd/ZnO catalysts. The formation of the Pd–Zn alloy, the effects of the ZnO support and the Pd loading, the stability of the catalyst and the reaction routes for CO formation are discussed below."
11,Pd–Zn alloy formation,"4.1 Pd–Zn alloy formation As revealed by the XRD characterization, a Pd–Zn alloy was formed after pre-reduction and the OMR reaction. This is evidenced by the diffraction peaks that appeared at 2θ values of 41.2° from Pd–Zn(111) and at 44.2° from Pd–Zn(200), which is consistent with the reports by Iwasa et al. [13] and Cubeiro and Fierro [16]. Diffractions from the Pd–Zn alloy can be observed when the Pd loading exceeds 2% for IMP samples and 3.5% for CP samples. The calculated crystal sizes shown in Figs. 5 and 7 indicated that the Pd–Zn crystallites formed on the CP samples are smaller than those on the IMP samples, suggesting higher dispersion of the Pd–Zn alloy on samples prepared by the coprecipitation method. However, much bigger Pd–Zn crystallites were formed on the HCP samples after the OMR test. This is due to the hydrolyzed Pd(NO3)2 solution used for the preparation of the HCP samples. The Pd(OH)2 clusters/particles contained in the solution may eventually result in bigger Pd–Zn crystallites. Though the crystal sizes as well as the crystallinity values of the Pd–Zn alloy are very different depending on the preparation methods and the Pd(NO3)2 solution, no significant shifts in the 2θ values of Pd–Zn alloy diffractions were observed. This suggests that the composition of the Pd–Zn alloy formed on the ZnO is identical, irrespective of the amount of Pd loading. As shown in Fig. 8, diffractions from the ZnO disappeared for HCP45, where the Pd–Zn alloy was the main phase detected, though it also contained trace amounts of elemental Pd. The two strongest diffractions at 2θ values of 41.22° and 44.14° are identical to the JCPDS data [18] indexed to a Pd–Zn alloy having tetragonal symmetry with a Pd:Zn atomic ratio of 1:1. Since the designed Pd:Zn atomic ratio for HCP45 is 1:1.6, an additional amount corresponding to 18–22% ZnO of either ZnO or metallic Zn should exist in the spent sample after the OMR test. However, besides the Pd–Zn alloy phase and trace amounts of elemental Pd, no other phases were detected by XRD analysis. This suggests that the additional amounts of the Zn-species in either the metallic or oxide forms (or both) are highly dispersed on the Pd–Zn alloy particles. Surface characterization of Pd/ZnO by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been reported by several research groups [16,19–22]. A shift of +0.7 to 1.0eV in the binding energy of the Pd(3d) levels was commonly observed when PdZn alloy was formed by hydrogen reduction treatment. On the other hand, exposure of the reduced samples to oxygen, even at room temperature, can shift the Pd(3d) levels towards a lower binding energy, and the Zn would reoxidize rapidly and the Pd would become more like bulk Pd metal. Apparently, strong metal-oxide interactions may exist in the Pd/ZnO system, and these may be responsible for the high dispersion of the Zn-species in Pd/ZnO catalysts with a high Pd content, which is believed to be essential to its catalytic performance in the OMR reaction."
12,Effect of ZnO support,"4.2 Effect of ZnO support As shown in Fig. 2, ZnO from the decomposition of Zn–oxalate usually has a larger crystal size than that from Zn–hydroxycarbonate, and calcination at higher temperature greatly increased the size of the ZnO crystallites. On the other hand, variations in catalytic activity follow a reverse trend to that for crystal size. In Fig. 16 , the gas yield was plotted as a function of crystal size for ZnO supports of IWI samples. Although the data are somewhat scattered, it is evident that high activity can be achieved with ZnO that has a smaller crystal size. The smaller crystal size may benefit both the dispersion of the Pd–Zn alloy on the surface and the interaction between the Pd–Zn alloy and the ZnO support. The intensity and broadness of the diffraction lines at 2θ values of 41.2° and 44.2° in Fig. 3 also revealed that the Pd–Zn alloys formed on Zn–hydroxycarbonate-derived ZnO have smaller crystal sizes than those formed on Zn–oxalate-derived ZnO. The higher dispersion of the Pd–Zn alloy on Zn–hydroxycarbonate derived-ZnO may contribute to the higher activities of these samples. It can thus be deduced that the decrease in activity of the samples prepared with ZnO calcined at higher temperatures was mainly due to the larger crystal size/lower surface area and poorer dispersion of the Pd–Zn alloy. Regarding the variation in the size of the ZnO crystals with the calcination temperature of the ZnO support (Fig. 2), catalyst sintering may occur at temperatures exceeding 400°C."
13,Effect of Pd loading,"4.3 Effect of Pd loading 4.3.1 Effects on the activity The effect of Pd loading was first investigated using IMP samples with Pd loadings of 1–10%. It is evident that increasing the amount of Pd on the ZnO results in significant changes in both the crystal size of the ZnO support before reaction and of the Pd–Zn alloy after reaction (Fig. 5). It is also noticed that the sizes of the ZnO crystallites were drastically decreased and then remained the same as those of the original ZnO support after the activity test. This can be explained in terms of the dissolution of the ZnO support in the Pd(NO3)2 +HNO3 aqueous solution during impregnation. After drying and calcinating, larger ZnO crystallites could be developed on the catalyst surface. For higher Pd loadings, more ZnO was dissolved in solution, and therefore the size of the newly-formed ZnO crystallites increased. The heterogeneity of the ZnO surface was increased by such a surface reconstruction. However, the new ZnO crystallites should be tightly connected to the PdO particles. During the reduction in 20% H2 gas flow at 400°C, the ZnO crystallites reacted with the PdO to form the Pd–Zn alloy. The ZnO support, which was not affected during impregnation, remained essentially unchanged after the reduction and OMR reaction. The increase in size of the Pd–Zn crystallites of the spent IMP samples suggested poor dispersion of the Pd–Zn alloy at higher Pd loadings. The variations in the crystal size of the Pd–Zn were also reflected in a variation of the catalytic performances (Fig. 12). The rapid increase in activity at lower Pd loading may be attributed to an increase in the surface concentration on the Pd–Zn alloy. At higher Pd loadings, the Pd–Zn alloy crystallites grew larger, which inhibited any further increase in the surface concentration of the Pd–Zn alloy and resulted in a relatively constant gas yield at Pd loadings exceeding 5%. The impregnated samples showed better performance than the coprecipitated ones at Pd loadings below 5%, which was most probably due to the higher surface concentration of Pd on the catalysts. Nevertheless, at higher Pd loading, the coprecipitated samples gave higher gas yields than the impregnated ones. A highly-active Pd/ZnO catalyst that is comparable to commercial Cu–Zn catalysts can be obtained by higher Pd loading (see below). At 5–10% Pd loadings, the gas yield on the CP samples also attained a constant value, very similar to that for the IMP samples. Correspondingly, the Pd–Zn crystal size appeared as a plateau at 5–8% Pd loadings. For further increases in Pd loading (up to 20%) the gas yield for the CP samples again increased (albeit moderately) compared to the case for Pd loadings of below 5%. The smaller Pd–Zn crystallites and high surface area of these samples may have contributed to the high gas yield. The catalytic activity of the HCP samples is lower than the corresponding CP samples, which may be related to the poorer dispersion or the bigger Pd–Zn crystallites. The calculated size of the Pd–Zn crystallites is very similar for all the HCP samples. However, the gas yield on HCP45 is much lower than that on other samples. The Pd–Zn alloy itself was reported to be very selective in the steam reforming reaction of methanol [23]. However, the activity seems to be very low without the presence of ZnO. If one considers the lower content of Zn-species (as discussed in Session 4.1), one would conclude that a certain amount of ZnO is necessary for achieving high activity and selectivity for Pd/ZnO catalysts with very high Pd contents. 4.3.2 Effects on the selectivity As shown in Fig. 12, the variation in selectivity as a function of Pd loading was basically the same as the variation in gas yield. High activity and selectivity were attained within a window of 5–37.5% Pd loading. Outside of this window, the gas yield and selectivity are low and the formation of CO is high. At Pd loadings of below 5%, the selectivity of either the CP or the IMP samples sharply increased as Pd loading rose from low values. CO formation is thus shown to decrease greatly with an increase in Pd on the ZnO. IMP selectivity exceeded that of the CP samples at Pd loadings of less than 5%. Larger Pd–Zn crystallites or well-crystallized Pd–Zn alloy particles would appear to have higher selectivity towards the OMR reaction. In the case of lower Pd loadings (as with CP1 and CP2), the Pd–Zn crystallites should be quite small. Such small Pd clusters and/or very small non-perfect Pd–Zn crystallites may not be selective in the OMR reaction and may therefore promote CO formation. For very small Pd–Zn crystallites, the metal-oxide interface may not be the same as that for larger ones, thus modifying the metal-support interaction and varying the selectivity of the catalyst for the OMR reaction. The selectivity of the IMP and CP samples is only slightly increased at Pd loadings of above 5%. The larger Pd–Zn alloy crystallites may have been the reason for this, but with the attainment of a certain size, any further increase would not be likely to have any significant effect on the selectivity of the catalyst. The reasons for this are not presently explainable, but further characterization of the catalyst surface may provide some clarification. An excess amount of Pd on the ZnO generates more elemental Pd sites that either show no interaction or else only weakly interact with the support, as in the case of HCP45. The substantial increase in CO formation on HCP45 can probably be attributed to the presence of the elemental Pd phase, which is reported to be active towards methanol decomposition [24] as shown in Eq. (4) (4) CH3OH(g)→CO+2H2 (ΔH°=+92kJ/mol)"
14,Catalyst stability,"4.4 Catalyst stability As shown in Fig. 11, the gas yield was stable for both the CP and IMP samples, but the selectivity of the IMP samples decreased with reaction time on stream. The CP samples are more stable with respect to selectivity. The XRD results indicated that the CP samples were more homogeneous than the IMP samples, and this would appear to be the reason for their better stability in the OMR reaction. The surface heterogeneity caused by the dissolution of ZnO during impregnation of the IMP samples may accelerate the changes in the Pd–Zn crystallites and the Pd–Zn alloy composition during oxidative reforming, with a consequent reduction in the reaction selectivity and increased CO formation. A comparison of CP20 with a commercial Cu–Zn catalyst is shown in Fig. 17 . It is clear that the Pd–Zn catalyst gave a much more stable gas yield than the Cu–Zn catalyst within 4h of reaction. However, the formation of CO on the Pd–Zn catalyst was higher than on the Cu–Zn catalyst. The concentration of CO in the product gases on Cu–Zn was 3300ppm (dry and N2-free base) while about 8000ppm of CO was produced on the Pd–Zn catalyst. Increasing the selectivity and decreasing the CO formation are significant in the development of advanced Pd/ZnO catalysts for the OMR reaction."
15,Reaction routes for CO formation,"4.5 Reaction routes for CO formation Because CO is a poison to the electrocatalyst at the fuel cell anode, CO formation is of particular concern in the development of commercial catalysts for hydrogen production by methanol reforming reactions. Since OMR is a combination of POM and SRM, the formation of CO could be more complex than those with only the POM or SRM reactions. The mechanism of SRM has been widely discussed in the literature [25–32]. The reaction is believed to proceed via four steps on Cu-based catalysts, as described below: (1) Dissociative adsorption of methanol to form surface methoxy groups (5) CH3OH→CH3O(a)+H(a) (2) Dehydrogenation of methoxy to formaldehyde or methylformate (6) CH3O(a)→H2CO+H(a) (7) CH3O(a)+H2CO→CH3OCHO+H(a) (3) Hydrolysis of formaldehyde or methylformate (8) H2CO+OH(a)→HCOO(a)+H2 (9) CH3OCHO+OH(a)→HCOO(a)+CH3OH (4) Decomposition of the surface intermediates (10) HCOO(a)→CO2 +H(a) (11) H2CO→CO+H2 where (a) denotes the adsorbed species. The dehydrogenation of the methoxy group is believed to be the rate-determining step [30,31]. A similar mechanism was also proposed for SRM on a Pd/ZnO catalyst [12,13]. As regards the high selectivity of Pd/ZnO for SRM, it is clear that the decomposition of the surface formate through dehydrogenation to CO2 and H2 (Eq. (10)) is dominant, and that CO is mainly formed via the decomposition of formaldehyde. The mode of further conversion of formaldehyde to either the surface formate or simple decomposition to form CO is probably related to its adsorption state on the catalyst surface. It is speculated that the surface monodentate H2CO is stabilized on either Cu or the Pd–Zn alloy and undergoes further hydroxylation and dehydrogenation to form the surface formate, while the bidentate H2CO tends to decompose directly to CO and H2. However, under the oxy-reforming condition, other reactions such as methanol decomposition (Eq. (4)) and reverse water gas shift (RWGS, Eq. (12)), which are very similar from a mechanistic point of view to the decomposition of surface formate through “dehydration” to CO and OH(a) (Eq. (13)), may also contribute to CO formation, depending on the surface characteristics and the composition of the catalysts. This is evidenced by the significant increase in CO formation on HCP45, in which elemental Pd was detected by XRD (12) CO2 +H2 →CO+H2O(ΔH°=+41kJ/mol) (13) HCOO(a)→CO+OH(a) The CO formation route in the POM reaction is expected to be similar to that in SRM, due to the common reaction intermediates such as the surface formate and formaldehyde [6,32–35]. The major differences between POM and SRM could be in the initial stages. Under POM conditions, the dissociative adsorption of oxygen may promote the dehydrogenation of either methanol or the intermediate methoxy group (Eqs. (14), (15) and (16)) and thus accelerate the conversion of methanol. However, due to the absence or very low partial pressure of water, the hydrolysis of formaldehyde or methylformate is much less than in the SRM condition, which may finally result in decomposition and an increase in CO formation (14) CH3OH+O(a)→CH3O(a)+OH(a) (15) CH3O(a)+O(a)→H2CO+OH(a) (16) CH3O(a)+OH(a)→H2CO+H2O The reaction results on CP30 (Fig. 13a) proved the combination effect of POM and SRM. With 100% conversion of oxygen, the gas yield of OMR is roughly the sum of the POM and SRM reactions. However, the total of OMR may not simply be the sum of POM and SRM. As can be seen from Fig. 13b, much more CO was produced in POM than in either SRM or OMR. The presence of water significantly inhibited CO formation (Fig. 14b). If one considers that WGS is a slow reaction, one may conclude that the marked decrease in CO formation by increasing the S/C ratio may not be directly related to the WGS reaction, but might be attributable to the interaction of water with the reaction intermediates such as the formaldehyde and methylformate species. The relevance of the temperature to the formation of CO on CP30 depends on the characteristics of the reaction. Considering the endothermic characteristic of methanol decomposition, which is difficult to avoid under both reforming and partial oxidation conditions, one sees that a higher temperature may favor the formation of CO by methanol decomposition. An increase in CO formation can be clearly seen in Fig. 15b. When the S/C ratio is below 0.5, the selectivity of CO formation is strongly dependent on the reaction temperature, indicating the contribution of methanol decomposition reaction to CO formation. However, CO formation usually decreases with increasing temperature at higher S/C ratios (above 1.0), though only slightly. We speculate that water adsorption on the catalyst surface may compete for sites that favor the methanol decomposition reaction. Once the partial pressure of water is high enough, the interaction of water with the reaction intermediates may reduce the decomposition and increase the selectivity of the reaction. If one takes this into consideration, it seems to be difficult to obtain higher selectivity or lower CO formation with the OMR reaction than with the SRM reaction."
16,Conclusion,The present study revealed that Pd/ZnO is very active and selective towards the OMR reaction to produce hydrogen. It showed high stability under the OMR condition. The catalyst activity is strongly related to Pd loading. Highly active and selective catalysts were obtained by the coprecipitation method with Pd loadings of between 5 and 37.5%. Excess amounts of Pd on the ZnO decreased the activity and increased CO formation. The characterization of fresh and spent catalysts by XRD revealed the formation of a Pd–Zn alloy under the OMR condition. The crystal sizes of both the ZnO support and the Pd–Zn alloy affect catalytic performance. The strong interaction between the Pd–Zn alloy and the ZnO support is speculated to be responsible for the high selectivity of the catalyst towards both the SRM and OMR reactions. The presence of elemental Pd promotes CO formation. A highly-dispersed and well-crystallized Pd–Zn alloy seems to be the prerequisite for an active and selective OMR catalyst. Small ZnO crystallites will be of benefit to both the dispersion of the Pd–Zn alloy and to the interaction between the Pd–Zn alloy and the ZnO support.
