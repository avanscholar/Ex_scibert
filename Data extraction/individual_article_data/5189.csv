0,Introduction,"Aqueous phase conversion of lignocellulosic biomass-derived oxygenated hydrocarbons to liquid alkanes has become a focal point, which was highly valued as a renewable route for bio-jet or diesel fuel production [1,2]. This process includes four consecutive steps: hydrolysis of biomass into C5 C6 sugars, acid-catalyzed dehydration of sugars to furfural and its derivatives, aldol condensation of furfural-based compounds with ketone to form the oxygenated hydrocarbons such as furfurylidene acetone (FA) and difurfurylidene acetone dimer (F2A) with the increased carbon chain, and the subsequent hydrogenation/hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) to liquid alkanes [3,4]. However, efficient hydrogenation/HDO process is usually difficult to obtain in aqueous phase conditions due to the lack of hydrophilic groups and the co-existence of unsaturated double bonds of CC and CO in the molecules of FA and F2A, which have caused water-insolubility and instability of these intermediates in hydrogenation/HDO treatment [5–7]. Recently, several approaches have been reported [8,9]. Chatterjee investigated a direct HDO process for FA conversion in supercritical carbon dioxide flow [10]. The two-step process of converting FA to jet/diesel fuel-range alkanes from hemicellulose-derived aqueous solutions was reported by Huber et al. The first step was the low-temperature hydrogenation (110–125°C) to saturate double bonds of FA and F2A over Pd/Al2O3, Pd/MgOZrO2 and Ru/C catalysts. The second step was a high-temperature HDO reaction of the hydrogenated intermediates for O removal and C7 C15 alkane production over Pt/SiO2 Al2O3 [11]. Previous studies also reported that the carbon yield distribution of the produced alkanes was greatly affected by the multifunctional support such as Al2O3 and SiO2 Al2O3 [12,13]. Yet few concrete experiments have been reported for the detailed effects of the acidity and pore structure of the supports on hydrogenation/HDO performance. In the same time, most of the reported approaches were carried out in the solvent of tetrahydrofuran (THF), using noble metal-based catalysts [14,15]. Preliminary studies from our groups have achieved remarkable HDO performance from lignin-derived phenolic compounds over SiO2 ZrO2-supported catalysts [16–18]. In the present work, direct HDO conversion of F2A in a batch reactor was investigated using the supported-Pt catalysts, including SAPO-11, HZSM-5, MCM-22, SiO2 Al2O3 and home-made SiO2 ZrO2. In the same time, a two-step process for F2A conversion, including the low-temperature hydrogenation of F2A to the oxygenated intermediates (H-F2A) in a batch reactor and the subsequent HDO of the hydrogenated H-F2A dimers to liquid alkanes in a fixed-bed reactor, was also carried out using the relatively cheap Raney Ni and Pt/SiO2 ZrO2 respectively. Methanol was used as solvent, considering its protonation effect, which could accelerate the O removal during hydrogenation/HDO process [19]. Particular emphasis is placed on the effect of the conversion process, the type of the solvent, pore size and acidity of the catalyst, reaction temperature, and H-F2A concentration for efficient F2A conversion to liquid alkanes (C8 C14)."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Raney Ni was prepared from nickel-magnesium alloy powder, which was slowly introduced into 10% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution at 95–100°C. The sodium hydroxide solution was removed and the obtained powder was washed and preserved in ethanol before use. Ni/Al molar ratio of the obtained Raney Ni was 5.4 with BET surface area of 27.3m2/g and pore volume of 0.03cm3/g. SiO2 ZrO2 support was prepared by the following procedure: the saturated NH4·NO3 aqueous solution and 25% ammonia solution were slowly introduced into 0.3mol/L Na2SiO3⋅9H2O and 0.1mol/L ZrOCl2⋅8H2O aqueous solutions with stirring respectively. The addition was kept until the pH values of the solutions were 8.0, by which the precipitates of Si(OH)4 and Zr(OH)4 were prepared respectively. The two precipitates were mixed, whisked, and then aged at 60°C for 3h. Subsequently, the mixed precipitate was filtered and washed with distilled water to remove chloride ions completely. The obtained solid residue was dried overnight at 120°C and calcined at 500°C for 4h, by which the home-made SiO2 Al2O3 support with Si/Zr molar ratio of 3.0 was prepared. Five supported Pt catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnating of chloroplatinic acid aqueous solution over four commercial supports of SAPO-11, HZSM-5, SiO2 Al2O3 and MCM-22 and the home-made SiO2 ZrO2. The BET surface area of the supports is 85.6m2/g, 416m2/g, 279m2/g, 534m2/g and 327m2/g. The pore volume is 0.096cm3/g, 0.21cm3/g, 1.53cm3/g, 0.75cm3/g and 0.92cm3/g respectively. The Pt loading amount was 1wt%. The catalyst precursor was dried at 120°C, calcined at 450°C for 4h and milled to 180–200 mesh for direct HDO process. The powder of 1wt%Pt/SiO2 ZrO2 was further pressed at 18MPa and sieved to 40–60 mesh for the second step of HDO reaction in the fixed-bed reactor during the two-step hydrogenation/HDO process."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The texture properties of the catalysts were determined by N2 physisorption at −196°C in a Quantachrome-ASIQMO002-2 apparatus. The acidic properties were analyzed by the NH3-temperature programmed desorption (TPD) program, performed in a Quantachrome-ASIQACIV200-2 apparatus. Each sample (0.20g) was pretreated at 600°C for 2h in He flow, cooled to 120°C, and then saturated with ammonia flow for 30min. After purging with He flow for 1h to remove the physisorbed ammonia, the desorption of ammonia was carried out at a heating rate of 10°C/min from 120°C to 750°C. The thermal analysis curves (TG/DSC) of the used catalyst were obtained by STA409C (Netzsch Instruments) from 40°C to 900°C at the heating rate of 10°C/min in air condition. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the catalysts were obtained with a Rigaku D/max-rC X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation, operating at 40kV and 40mA."
4,Direct HDO and two-step of hydrogenation/HDO processes,"2.3 Direct HDO and two-step of hydrogenation/HDO processes Direct HDO process was carried out in a batch reactor of 140mL at 260°C, 5.0MPa and 800rpm stirring with the supported 1wt%Pt powder catalyst. For each run, 1.2g of the freshly reduced catalysts, 6.0g F2A and 54ml methanol as solvent were charged into the batch reactor. After 12h reaction, the reactor was cooled down and the liquid samples were withdrawn and analyzed. Each operation was repeated twice to minimize the experimental errors. In the two-step process of hydrogenation/HDO, the first step of F2A hydrogenation was carried out in the same batch reactor of 140mL at 50°C, 1.0–5.0MPa and 800rpm stirring with Raney Ni catalyst. In each run, 8.0g of F2A, 2.0g of Raney Ni and 32ml solvent (methanol, THF or cyclohexane) were charged in the batch reactor. After 2h reaction, the cooled liquid was withdrawn and the solvent was removed via a vacuum evaporator. The condensed sample was dissolved in methanol again to obtain 18wt%, 28wt% and 38wt% of H-F2A methanol solution respectively, which was charged to a fixed-bed reactor (ID: 10mm, Length: 300mm) by a syringe pump for the second step of HDO conversion at 260–320°C. The liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) of H-F2A solution and H2 flow rate was 0.75h−1 and 60ml/min respectively. The liquid samples were collected via a condenser and a gas–liquid separator after time on stream (TOS) of 3h."
5,Product analysis and calculation,"2.4 Product analysis and calculation Liquid samples were qualitatively analyzed by Agilent 7890-5975C GC–MS equipped with a DB-5 column using ultra-high purity helium as the carrier gas. The temperatures of injector and detector of GC–MS were both set at 250°C and the column temperature was programmed with a sequence: hold at 40°C for 1min, ramp at 250°C at 20°C/min and hold at 250°C for 2min. The quantitative analysis was performed by a Shimadzu GC2010 with SE-30 column and FID detector using n-C15H32 as internal standard to calculate conversion and carbon yield. The temperature of injector and detector of GC was set at 250°C and 280°C respectively. And the column temperature was programmed with a sequence: hold at 50°C for 1min, ramp at 250°C at 10°C/min and hold at 250°C for 4min. The light alkanes (C1 C5) in the gaseous product were quantified by GC equipped with Porapak Q column and FID detector. F2A conversion, selectivity to the different intermediates of the hydrogenated F2A dimers (H-F2As) and carbon yield were calculated based on carbon atoms. Conversion of F 2 A % = ( moles of F 2 A Initial −moles of F 2 A Final ) / ( moles of F 2 A Initial ) × 100 % Selectivity of H- F 2 A dimer % = ( moles of H- F 2 A dimer ) / ∑ moles of H- F 2 A dimers × 100 % Yield of Cn %=(n ×moles of Cn produced/(13×moles of F2A converted))×100%, Cn -the produced alkanes or oxygenated-hydrocarbon intermediates whose carbon number is n. Selectivity of H-F2A dimer represents the selectivity of H-F2A dimer in the liquid samples after the first-step of low-temperature F2A hydrogenation in the batch reactor, which is calculated by the peak are normalization method. Yield of Cn represents the carbon yield of the produced alkanes or oxygenated hydrocarbons or the F2A-derived intermediates with carbon number of n after HDO reaction."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Direct HDO process for F2A conversion,"3.1 Direct HDO process for F2A conversion F2A was completely converted over different Pt catalysts after 12h reaction of direct HDO operation at 260°C. Yet quite amount of carbon in F2A was converted to the oxygenated hydrocarbons, including C11 C13 chain alcohols & ketones and F2A-derived hydrogenated dimers with furan rings (H-F2A, the detailed compounds were exhibited in Fig. 4 below), as shown in Table 1 . And the distribution of carbon yield differed with the Pt catalysts used. The carbon yield of H-F2A species was 23.5% over 1wt%Pt/SAPO-11. The produced liquid exhibited a color of yellow–brown as shown in Fig. 1 (A), which indicated its insufficient HDO performance. The small pore structure of the ten-membered rings as 0.4×0.65nm in SAPO-11 of 1wt%Pt/SAPO-11 should be main reason of its poor HDO performance [20]. It had a great chance to be blocked by the agglomerated Pt particles at the mouth of pores, which decreased the micropore volume to 0.047cm3/g as shown in Table 2 . The low carbon yield (33.9%) of C8-14 alkanes over 1wt%Pt/HZSM-5 might also be deduced by its small micropore volume of 0.09cm3/g, together with its relatively large amount of medium acidic centers, shown by the big desorption peak at 200–500°C in Fig. 2 . The medium acidity of 1wt%Pt/HZSM-5 has also accelerated the hydrocracking of the primarily produced liquid alkanes, which shifted alkane carbon distribution to light hydrocarbons with 20.4% to C8 C11. However, high yield of C8 C14 alkanes was not obtained over 1wt%Pt/SiO2 Al2O3 which has the relatively large pore size of 20nm. It was reported that the HDO performance is highly depended on the acidity and active metal centers of the catalysts [21]. In the same time, the self-condensation of the oxygenated intermediate species could also occur on the strong acidic centers of the catalyst [22]. In this context, 1wt%Pt/SiO2 Al2O3 has the highest intensity of medium acidic centers at 200–500°C in Fig. 2, which had enhanced the polymerization and hydrocracking of the intermediates during direct HDO process and resulted in high CH4 yield of 9.4%. C8-14 alkane yields of more than 45% were obtained over both 1wt%Pt/MCM-22 and 1wt%Pt/SiO2 ZrO2 with moderate acidity and pore structure, especially over 1wt%Pt/SiO2 ZrO2 with 9nm pore size. However there is still 12.2% carbon yield of the oxygenated hydrocarbons after 12h reaction. And the liquid sample exhibited a light yellow color in Fig. 1(B), indicating the inefficient saturation of the double bonds in the intermediates. To improve the performance of direct HDO process, longer operation time was carried out over the optimized 1wt%Pt/SiO2 ZrO2 and the results are shown in Table 3 . With the increase of reaction time from 4h to 20h, the carbon yield of C11 C13 chain alcohols & ketones and H-F2A decreased from 16.6% to 6.44% and 23.7% to 2.41% respectively, which indicated the improved HDO performance over 1wt%Pt/SiO2 ZrO2 with the prolonged reaction time. However, the increased carbon yield of light alkanes of C1 C7 with reaction time was also observed. And the C8-14 alkane yield was decreased to 51.3% and 47.2% after 16h and 20h reaction respectively. The phenomenon that the carbon yield decrease of H-F2A is faster than that of C11 C13 chain alcohols & ketones could also be observed in Table 3. Combining with the other results that the carbon yield of C11 C13 chain alcohols & ketones was higher than that of hydrogenated H-F2A dimers over all Pt catalysts used in Table 1, it could be deduced that hydrogenation and deoxygenation of CO bonds for O removal is more difficult than the saturation of CC bonds in the F2A-derived intermediated. The effect of reaction temperature is shown in Fig. 3 . C13 alkane with 41.5% of carbon yield is the primary component in the liquid samples at high HDO temperature of 260°C, which had favored the ring opening reaction of H-F2A intermediates and the subsequent hydrogenation reaction over Pt catalysts. Yet the alkane yield of C8 C14 decreased to 36.9% when the temperature was further increased to 280°C and color of the liquid sample became darker as shown in Fig. 1(C). The thermal instability of F2A was the main reason, which was easily aggregated and adhered on the wall of the reactor or the surface of the catalyst to decrease liquid alkane yield. And it should be pointed that the carbon yield of the detectable components, including alkanes and oxygenated hydrocarbons, is less than 85% in the direct HDO experiments for F2A conversion discussed above, which means that quite amount of carbon in F2A was wasted either by aggregation or by polymerization. That co-existence of the three kinds of double bounds, alkene CC, furan ring CC and acyl CO, and one ether bond in furan ring of F2A molecules was the main reasons, which required different hydrogenation or deoxygenation condition before the saturated structures were formed."
8,Two-step hydrogenation/HDO process for F2A conversion,"3.2 Two-step hydrogenation/HDO process for F2A conversion To increase carbon yield and improve the stability of F2A and the intermediates, a two-step process for F2A conversion to liquid alkanes was studied, including a low-temperature hydrogenation of the double bonds of F2A to H-F2A dimers over cheap Raney Ni and the subsequent high-temperature HDO of H-F2A dimers to liquid alkanes. 3.2.1 Low-temperature hydrogenation reaction of F2A F2A was dissolved in three types of solvents, methanol (protic polar solvent), tetrahydrofuran (THF, aprotic polar solvent) and cyclohexane (nonpolar solvent). The effect of solvent on the performance of low-temperature hydrogenation reaction in the batch reactor is shown in Fig. 4 . Nine hydrogenated intermediates of H-F2A dimers were detected by GC–MS, which indicated a multi-step hydrogenation of the double bonds and ether bonds in F2A molecules. These H-F2A dimers could be sorted into three types: ketone H-dimers (type I), alcohol H-dimers (type II); and spiro-H dimers (type III), according to the different hydrogenation degree in F2A molecules. Rapid hydrogenation of F2A with Raney Ni in methanol was obtained with 99.5% F2A conversion after 25min reaction. F2A conversion was 80.5% and 59.7% at 25min reaction time in the solvent of THF and cyclohexane respectively, which was increased to 99.6% and 88.4% at 2h reaction time. Yet the predominant components were the ketone H-dimers, as shown in Fig. 4(B), which was the hydrogenation of CC bonds in the alkene chains and the rings of furan. Thus the selectivity of deep hydrogenated intermediates, such as alcohol H-dimers and spiro-H dimers was low. For examples, the selectivity of 1,5-bis(tetrahydrofuran-2-yl) pentan-3-ol(II-c) and 2-(2-(tetrahydrofuran-2-yl)ethyl)-1,6-dioxaspiro [4.4]nonane(III-b) was 19.0% and 10.0% in THF and cyclohexane solution respectively. While 80.8% selectivity of II-c and III-b was obtained in methanol solution at 2h reaction time. It could be due to the protonation effect of methanol, which accelerated the activation of double bonds of alkene CC, furan CC and acyl CO in F2A molecule. Thus the dissociated H species, adsorbed on the surface of Raney Ni, provided the necessary H species for the saturation of these functional groups. Especially the hydrogenation of acyl CO increased the selectivity of alcohol H-dimers, which also increased the solubility and stability of intermediates in methanol solvent. Table 4 shows the effect of H2 pressure on the selectivity of H-dimers after reaction for 2h with Raney Ni in methanol solution. 99.5% of F2A conversion was obtained even at 1MPa of H2 pressure, indicating the considerable hydrogenation ability of Raney Ni. The result is even comparable with that over noble Ru/C catalysts at 110°C [11]. The primary H-F2A intermediates were ketone H-dimers at low H2 pressure of 1MPa, which was 33.6% and 22.6% for I-e and I-d respectively. The selectivity of alcohol H-dimers was increased with the enhanced H2 pressure. II-c selectivity was 72.1% and 83.0% at 2.5MPa and 5MPa of H2 pressure respectively. III-b selectivity of spiro-H dimers decreased from 8.7% to 0.6% at 5MPa. The selectivity of I-e, the ketone H-dimer with acyl CO bond decreased from 33.6% to 13.8% as H2 pressure increased from 1MPa to 5MPa. It seems that the conversion of I-e to the alcohol H-dimer of II-c was the rate-determining step in the low-temperature hydrogenation of F2A over Raney Ni in the batch reactor, according to ca. 14% selectivity of I-e even at high H2 pressure of 5MPa. 3.2.2 High-temperature HDO reaction of H-F2A dimers After low-temperature hydrogenation of F2A in methanol for 2h over Raney Ni at 5.0MPa and 50°C, the produced liquid sample, consisting primarily of alcohol H-dimers, was concentrated using a rotary evaporator, subsequently dissolved by methanol again to prepare the H-F2A methanol solution with the desired concentration of 18wt%, 28wt% and 38wt%. The solutions were pumped to a fixed-bed reactor for the second step of high-temperature HDO over the optimized 1wt%Pt/SiO2 ZrO2 as described in Section 3.1 and the results are shown in Table 5 . Carbon yield of C8-14 alkanes was decreased as the high concentrated H-F2A effluent was the feedstock, which was 65.6% and 51.9% using 28wt% and 38wt% H-F2A solutions respectively. And the carbon yield of C13 alkane decreased from 70.0% to 42.4%. The carbon yields of C11 C13 chain alcohols and alkenes, such as tridecanol and dodecanol, increased. The carbon yield of tridecanol was increased from 0.9% to 4.3% with the enhanced H-F2A solution concentration from 18wt% to 38wt%. And the color of the produced liquid sample became dark with the increase of H-F2A concentration. It may be due to the insufficient HDO capability over 1wt%Pt/SiO2 ZrO2 when high H-F2A-contained feedstock was used. Effect of reaction temperature on HDO performance is shown in Table 6 , using 18wt% H-F2A methanol solution as feedstock. The yield of C8 C14 alkanes was as low as 40.5% at 260°C and the obtained liquid sample was light yellow as shown in Fig. 5 (A), which indicated the existence of the compounds with unsaturated CC bonds. Some intermediates such as tridecanol and dodecanol and tridecene were detected by GC–MS. The carbon yield of tridecanol was as high as 11.7%, which decreased the yield of liquid alkanes correspondingly. HDO performance was greatly improved with clear and transparent liquid sample as the temperature of HDO reaction was increased to 280°C, which naturally separated into two phases of methanol solvent and liquid alkane products as shown in Fig. 5(B). The carbon yield of tridecanol was decrease to 0.9%. The carbon yield of C8 C14 alkanes was 82.9% and C13 alkane was the primarily component of 70.0%, as shown by the carbon yield distribution in Fig. 6 . The increased carbon yield of CH4 indicated the concurrent reaction of hydrocracking reactions at higher HDO temperature of 300°C and 320°C. In the same time, more than 10% of unsaturated H-F2A dimers, such as ketone H-dimers of I-e in the feedstock, may have self-polymerized at high HDO temperature to form the cross-linked heavier materials, which decreased the carbon yield of C8 C14 alkanes to 71.0% and 64.0% with the increase of HDO temperature to 300°C and 320°C respectively. The stability of high-temperature HDO performance over 1wt%Pt/SiO2 ZrO2 was tested at a lower LHSV of 0.6h−1 for a long time TOS and the results were shown in Fig. 7 . The carbon yield of C8 C14 alkanes was 67.3% at 10h TOS, lower than that of 82.9% at LHSV of 0.75h−1 in Table 6 due to the relatively low feed rate of H-dimer solution. However the carbon yield of C8 C14 alkanes was stable and kept at 58.2–72.8% during 120h TOS. C11 C14 alkanes were the primary products, which accounted for 51.0–62.1% of total carbon yield. The stable activity of 1wt%Pt/SiO2 ZrO2 during HDO reaction might be deduced from its textural and acidic properties: (a) The medium acidic centers of SiO2 ZrO2 support favored the activation of the oxygenated intermediates and the decrease of carbon deposition on the catalyst surface, as reported in the HDO reaction of guaiacol in our previous reports [17]; (b)SiO2 dispersed Pt active centers and ZrO2 with its large surface area to increase the mass transferring during HDO reaction; (C)SiO2 ZrO2 support was relatively stable under hydrothermal condition during hydro-treating of the oxygenated compounds to liquid alkanes, compared with A2O3-based supports [23]. To verify the deduction mentioned above, the characterizations of 1wt%Pt/SiO2 ZrO2 by XRD, NH3-TPD and thermal analysis were performed, shown in Fig. 8 . The NH3 desorption peak of the fresh 1wt%Pt/SiO2 ZrO2 is at 150–450°C, indicating the existing of weak and medium strength of acidity. These acidic centers were formed due to the substitution of Zr into TO4 structure of SiO2 during catalyst preparation process, which caused the formation of hybrid bonds of M1 OM2, and thus affected the electrostatic potential of the support [24]. NH3-TPD pattern of the used 1wt%Pt/SiO2 ZrO2 after 120h TOS of HDO reaction exhibits the decreased desorption area at 200–400°C with the increased desorption area above 400°C. That indicated the formation of the stronger acid centers, which had activated HDO reaction of the oxygenated intermediates discussed above. While the similar XRD patterns of the fresh and used 1wt%Pt/SiO2 ZrO2 in Fig. 8(B) indicated the stability of the catalyst structure and active Pt phase during long time operation of HDO, which shows the characteristic peaks corresponding to SiO2 ZrO2 at 2θ =20–30° and Pt phase at 2θ =39.8°, 46.3° and 67.5°. The weight loss at 150–600°C of the used 1wt%Pt/SiO2 ZrO2 is about 32% in the TG profile of Fig. 8(C). The weight losses at 280–400°C and 400–600°C were attributed to the combustion of the reaction residues and precursor species of the deposited carbon respectively, confirmed by the exothermic heat curve of DSC. For comparison, the used 1wt%Pt/SiO2 ZrO2 was washed by methanol solvent and analyzed by thermal method, which corresponded to a weight loss of only 7wt% at 150–650°C. And there is no obvious exothermic heat peak in its DSC curve. So it could be deduced that methanol solvent could dissolve and carry away the coke precursor to decrease carbon deposition on the catalyst surface during HDO reaction in the fixed-bed reactor. That may be the one of the reasons for the stable HDO performance over 1wt%Pt/SiO2 ZrO2 in methanol solvent in this context. 3.2.3 Reaction pathway of two-step hydrogenation/HDO process for F2A conversion Hydrogenation or HDO of biomass-derived furfural compounds to liquid alkanes is usually a balance of multi-step or concurrent reactions with the complicated reaction network of hydrogenation, decarbonylation, decarboxylation, hydrocracking/hydroisomeration, dehydration, which involved many oxygenated compounds such as H-F2A species, tridecanol, and tridecylic aldehyde as intermediates, as shown in Scheme 1 . The lone pair of electrons from O atom, together with the other four electrons in the furan ring of F2A, determinates that cyclic ring part of F2A molecule has the number of the π electrons of 6, following the Hückel’s rule to have aromatic properties. Thus the hydrogenation of CC bond in the furan ring of F2A is much more difficult than that of the CC bonds in the chains of the alkenes. According the results of carbon yield distribution discussed above, the low selectivity of I-a, I-b and I-c in the H-F2A solution indicates the quick hydrogenation rate of the CC bond in the chains of alkenes. The primary intermediate component, the alcohol H-dimer of II-C, might have followed the two different pathways during F2A hydrogenation reaction over Raney Ni catalysts at low temperature of 50°C: (1) I-a→I-b→I-c→I-d→I-e→II-c; (2) I-a→I-b→I-c→II-a→II-b→II-c. The quick hydrogenation of CC bonds in the chains of alkenes results in the rapid reaction steps of I-a→I-b→I-c. Due to the much more difficulty of CO bond hydrogenation than that of CC bonds in furan rings, it could be presumed that the pathway (1) should be the most possible route for II-c production. And the rate-determining step is I-e→II-c, confirmed by the existence of more than 10% of I-e selectivity after low-temperature hydrogenation reaction. And the difficulty of CO bond hydrogenation also resulted in the low selectivity to II-a and spiro-H dimers. I-e could be further hydrogenated to II-c over Pt//SiO2 ZrO2 catalyst due to the excellent hydrogenation activity of Pt. The furan rings in the molecules of H-F2A dimers were broken to form tridecylic aldehyde by the acidic centers of SiO2 ZrO2 support [24]. After the quick reactions of the ketone/aldehyde hydrogenation, the intermediates of polyols were produced, which were dehydrated to form the corresponding alkenes over the acidic centers of 1wt%Pt/SiO2 ZrO2. And the alkenes were further hydrogenated to the desired long-chain alkanes. Due to the quick ketone/aldehyde hydrogenation, alcohol dehydration and tridecene hydrogenation, these intermediates were detected with trace amounts in the final products, especially when the HDO temperature was above 280°C. The light alkanes were derived from the hydrocracking of intermediates and alkanes over acidic centers. The increased yield of light C1 C7 alkanes over 1wt%Pt/HZSM-5 with micropore structure and Pt/SiO2 Al2O3 with strong acidic centers indicated severer hydrocracking of the produced long-chain alkanes and intermediates. As 1wt%Pt/SiO2 ZrO2 was introduced, the yield of C8 C14 was enhanced due to its medium acidity and proper pore size. The existence of small amount of C14 alkane in the products may results from the coupling reaction between the long-chain alkenes dehydrated from the corresponding alcohol and the light hydrocarbons, although the detailed formation mechanism needs to be further investigated [11]. Small amount of CO and CO2 was also detected in the gaseous product, which may be the result from either methanol decomposition reaction or the reactions of decarbonylation/decarboxylation over the acidic supports [25]."
9,Conclusion,"Direct HDO and two-step hydrogenation/HDO processes for the catalytic conversion of F2A to liquid alkanes was investigated. Modifying the supports of Pt catalysts with home-made SiO2 ZrO2 could improve liquid alkane yield, resulting from the moderate acidity and pore structure of 1wt%Pt/SiO2 ZrO2 catalyst. Yet the efficient performance of direct HDO process is not obtained due to the co-existence of the double bonds (alkene CC, furan CC and acyl CO) and furan O in the molecules of F2A, which required different optimization condition for hydrogenation and deoxygenation reaction. The high carbon yield of C8 C14 alkanes as 82.9% was obtained in the two-step hydrogenation/HDO process. Protonation effect from methanol solvent increased the conversion of low-temperature hydrogenation of F2A and high-temperature HDO of H-F2A dimers over Raney Ni and Pt/SiO2 ZrO2 respectively. The first step of low-temperature hydrogenation reaction could pre-saturate the double bonds of alkene CC, furan CC and acyl CO with cheap Raney Ni, which increased the solubility of H-F2A intermediates in methanol solvent and decreased the carbon deposition on the catalysts. And rate-determining step was acyl CO bond hydrogenation in the first step of F2A hydrogenation, due to the primary component of alcohol H-F2A dimer II-c in the intermediate samples and more than 10% content of I-e as ketone type of H-F2A dimers. In the second step of HDO conversion of H-F2A, the stable operation was obtained over 1wt%Pt/SiO2 ZrO2 catalyst in a fixed-bed reactor, resulting from the weak and medium acidic centers for the reactions of furan ring breaking and dehydration and metal centers for hydrogenation. The electrophilic acidic centers from SiO2 ZrO2 support had activated the acyl and oxygen atoms of II-c and I-e, which were likely to be attacked by the dissociated H species, adsorbed on the surface of the adjacent Pt sites, to form the saturated alkanes. Furthermore, acidic and pore structure of catalysts could also determine the product distribution via controlling the competitive hydrogenation and hydrocracking reaction during HDO conversion of H-F2A."
