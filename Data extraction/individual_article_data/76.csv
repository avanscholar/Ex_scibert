0,Introduction,"The ever-increasing human population and the consequent economic activity have led to an insatiable demand for energy. Currently, 84% of the world's energy supply is met with fossil fuel; however, the fast depletion of fossil fuel, environmental pollution, and global warming has made it vital to search for alternative environmental-friendly and renewable energy resources [1]. Jules Verne (1874) once said that “Water will be the coal of the future” [2] and in the last five decades, solar energy conversion by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen has been demonstrated to be a potential renewable energy resource [3]. Hydrogen (H2) is one of the primary candidates amongst the future solar energy fuels, and among all the fuels it has the highest energy density (∼120 MJ/kg) and is abundant on earth in the form of water, organic matter, and hydrocarbons [4]. H2 can be produced by several methods i.e. natural gas steam reforming, partial methanol oxidation, gasification of coal, thermochemical water splitting, high-temperature electrolysis, photo-biological water splitting, photo-electrochemical water splitting, and photocatalytic water splitting. However, the efficient and environmentally friendly extraction of H2 from natural resources has been a challenge and technological development is still a work in progress. Renewable generation of H2 was greatly boosted by the discovery of photocatalytic water splitting by Honda and Fujishima in 1972 [3]. Since then, the photocatalytic method has been extensively used for the study of water recycling and purification, self-cleaning surfaces, and water splitting [5]. Water splitting in presence of solar light and a powdered photocatalyst by mimicking the photosynthesis process is one of the promising routes of H2 production. The particulate photocatalytic H2 production method has drawn wide attention due to its simplicity and cost-effective design. The particulate photocatalytic water splitting (PPWS) system requires only a water pool containing reusable semiconducting photocatalysts and solar light. This simple system has the potential to scale up H2 production on an industrial scale to fulfill the dream of a clean and green hydrogen economy. Pinaud et al. studied the economic and technological feasibilities of single bed particle suspension, dual bed particle suspension, fixed panel array, and tracking concentrator array hydrogen production systems and reported that the particle bed system i.e. PPWS system will cost the least [9]. However, the highest solar to hydrogen conversion (STH) efficiency reported for the PPWS system is under 5% and for commercial viability, the required STH efficiency is 10% [10]. To date, the research on photocatalytic hydrogen production via water splitting has progressed in a direction of achieving quantum efficiency almost equal to unity [6]. Several photocatalysts capable of handling overall water splitting (OWS) under ultraviolet and visible light via one-step excitation and two-step excitations have been developed over the decades. In general, light-harvesting ability, charge carrier separation efficiency, stability in aqueous solution, reaction system, and the cost of the catalysts are particularly important in selecting a photocatalyst [7,8]. These aspects of the photocatalysts are covered in detail in some of the excellent recent review articles published. For example, Takashi Hisatomi et al. reviewed the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of large-scale solar hydrogen production via water splitting [128a]. Qian Wang et al. focused on the obstacles affecting the practical feasibility of the PPWS system and potential future design strategies to overcome the limitations [8a]. Shanshan Chen and coworkers discussed the surface modification strategies such as surface functionalization, crystal phase, and facet, defect engineering, and construction of heterostructure and Z-scheme systems for the PPWS system [8b]. Zheng Wang et al. presented methods to evaluate accurately the photocatalytic performance and reviewed the one-step and Z-scheme mechanism, and summarized the OWS for the immobilized particulate systems [8c]. Similarly, Zhiliang Wang and coworkers introduced the standard testing protocols and efficiency measurement for the PPWS system, as there is a wide disparity in the reported STH and AQE values in the literature [8d]. Several other review articles focused on material aspect [10a,10b], surface modification and defect engineering [10c], light-harvesting strategies [16a], charge transport mechanism [16b,16c], photo corrosion [28c], effect of external field [12a], state-of-the-art characterization methods [12b] and sacrificial hydrogen production [62] have been reported and interested readers are encouraged to refer to these review articles for further study. However, in most of the review articles on the PPWS system, less attention has been paid towards the comparative evaluation of the AQE and STH conversion efficiency of various organic, inorganic and hybrid materials. Herein, we present the most significant studies with the highest reported AQE and STH conversion efficiencies carried out in the development of the PPWS system to give readers an outlook on the progressive direction of the photocatalytic materials research for OWS and H2 production via photo-reforming. Finally, the limitations of existing photocatalytic H2 production systems and the future perspectives on the designing of an efficient photocatalytic system are explained."
1,General principles of water splitting,"As shown in Fig. 1 , water splits into oxygen and hydrogen upon light irradiation at the photocatalyst surface and the overall reaction is given as: (1) 2 H 2 O → 2 H 2 + O 2 ( E > 1.23 eV ) The overall reaction is a highly endothermic uphill chemical reaction involving a Gibb's Free Energy change of ΔG° = 237 kJ mol−1 [11]. Hydrogen production from water necessitates a significant amount of input energy and for a water-splitting photocatalyst; the potential difference (voltage) must be above 1.23 V at 0 pH. The following are the main steps involved in the water-splitting process [12–14]. 1. Photon absorption and generation of excitons in the semiconductor photocatalyst 2. Separation and migration of electron-hole pairs to the semiconductor surface 3. Reduction (hydrogen evolution) and oxidation (oxygen evolution) reactions to produce H2 and O2 from water The two half of the water-splitting reactions are [12,13]: Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER): (2) 2 H + + 2 e − → H 2 Acidic aqueous solution (3) 2 H 2 O + 2 e − → H 2 + 2 OH − Alkaline aqueous solution Oxygen evolution reaction (OER): (4) 2 H 2 O → O 2 + 4 e − + 4 H + Acidic aqueous solution (5) 4 OH − → O 2 + 4 e − + 2 H 2 O Alkaline aqueous solution The aforementioned three fundamental processes and their efficiencies account for the overall solar energy conversion efficiency, ηtotal (6) η total = η absorption × η separation × η reaction where ηabsorption is the photon absorption efficiency (the electron−hole pair fractions generated by the incident photon flux), ηseparation is the charge separation efficiency (amount of distinct charge carriers that isolate and diffuse to particle surface), and ηreaction is the reaction efficiency or charge utilization processes (the efficiency of the surface reactions occurring at the solid-liquid interface). Understanding the thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives of water splitting provides insight into materials selection and designing an efficient photocatalyst. A kinetic outlook into the two half-reactions shows that they have identical reaction rates, but the HER reaction involves two electrons and two protons, while four electrons and four protons are required for the OER reaction, and it is extremely difficult to achieve such a kinetic equilibrium. Thus, it is the oxidation half-reaction that is the restraining factor of the overall performance of a photocatalytic system [15]. So, study on the spontaneous HER and OER processes occurring in a photosystem are challenging and the use of scavengers to scavenge holes (for HER) and electrons (for OER) have been employed to enhance the photo activity. These photocatalytic half-reactions have substantially lower ΔG than OWS (237 kJ mol−1) or even negative ΔG, and solely produce H2 or O2. The performance of a photocatalyst is evaluated based on the efficiency of solar energy conversion and the lifetime of a catalyst. Typically, activity is evaluated as the rate of reaction concerning the total gas produced per unit illumination time. It is important to note that the unit photocatalyst mass (i.e. μmolh−1g−1) does not normalize the activity since the reaction rate is not inherently comparative to the mass of the photocatalyst that was used in the reaction. Besides, it is not prudent to explicitly match the reaction rates of photocatalysts reported by diverse groups because of the differences in experimental conditions. The concept of apparent quantum yield (AQY), solar to hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency, and turnover frequency (TOF) have therefore been added to explain suitable comparisons irrespective of the experimental settings [14,15]. The quantum yield (Q.Y.) can be used to assess the activity of a photocatalyst for water splitting. However, due to the scattering and reflection of light, there are practical complications in determining the absorbed photons or reacted electrons. Thus, IUPAC recommends the use of the terms “apparent quantum yield” and is calculated as [10]: (7) A . Q . Y . ( % ) = 2 ( Number of H 2 molecules released ) Number of incident photons ∗ 100 The STH conversion efficiency is calculated by using the following equation [16]. (8) STH ( % ) = Energy of generated H 2 Energy of incident solar light * 100 = E H 2 E Solar * 100 And E H 2 = ( H 2 in mol sec ) * 232 kJ / mol E Solar = P*S*t where, P = irradiated solar energy (W/m2), S = area of irradiation (m2), t = irradiation time (sec). The Turnover frequency (TOF) is the number of water molecules split on an active site in a particular period of time (sec) and is given by [14]. (9) TOF = mol H 2 mol cat ∗ time"
2,Hydrogen production via overall water splitting,"2.1 Hydrogen production via overall water splitting In the overall water splitting (OWS), H2 and O2 are produced in the stoichiometric ratio (2:1). The OWS can be classified based on one-step and two-step photoexcitation photocatalysts. 2.1.1 One-step photoexcitation catalysts for water splitting In a one-step photoexcitation process, electrons and holes are generated in a single semiconducting photocatalyst and as shown in Fig. 2 (a), the photogenerated charge carriers split water into H2 and O2. The transition metal ions with d0 and d10 electronic configurations (Ti4+, Ga3+, Ta5+, Zr4+, In3+, Sn4+, etc.) are the typical metal cations that have been effectively employed for OWS. The conduction band minima (CBM) of d0 and d10 oxides are primarily made of hybridized d and sp orbitals, respectively. The valence band maxima (VBM) is consisting of O (2p) orbitals and is positioned at 3 V approximately (versus NHE, at pH = 0). Consequently, if the CBM is placed at a higher negative potential compared to H+/H2 energy, the bandgap energies for these oxides would surpass 3 eV. Therefore, concerning the OER, all d0-type and d10-type metal oxides appear to unveil an excess potential difference. The incorporation of an occupied energy state above the O2p level can shift the valance band edge and bandgap of d0 and d10 metal configurations from UV light to the visible region. The first report on one-step photoexcited catalysts for OWS by PPWS system was the solid solution of GaN and ZnO mixed with rhodium and chromium oxide. Both these wide bandgap materials absorb only UV irradiation but the light absorption was found to be extended up to 500 nm in the solid mixture [17]. After calcination a quantum yield of 5.9% was achieved [18]. Calcination of (Ga1−x Znx) (N1−x Ox) enhanced its water splitting activity due to the reduced density of oxygen and/or zinc-related defects that function as recombination centers for the photogenerated carriers. Strontium titanate is another potential photocatalytic material with bandgap energy of 3.2 eV and its AQE for OWS has been improved over the years. Very recently, Domen and Co-workers modified an aluminum-doped strontium titanate (SrTiO3:Al) photocatalyst to accomplish an AQE of 96% at the wavelength range of 350–360 nm (Fig. 3 ) [6]. To promote the HER and OER reactions separately, selective photodeposition of co-catalysts Rh/Cr2O3 and CoOOH on various crystal facets of SrTiO3 was performed. In addition to facet engineering, aluminum (Al) doping was used for defect suppression, and a Cr2O3 shell was used to inhibit oxidation-reduction back reaction. Similarly, Bin Tian et al. reported a one-pot solvothermal process for the direct preparation of few-layer black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets. These BP nanosheets were modified with amorphous cobalt phosphide (Co–P) nanoparticles. The efficient light absorption by black phosphorus nanosheets (∼75% of solar energy) and the high-charge carrier separation efficiency achieved was ascribed to the loading of Co–P. The amorphous Co–P modified BP was used for OWS with an AQE of 42.55% at 430 nm and STH conversion efficiency of 5.4% (Fig. 4 ). [7]. However, the STH conversion efficiency of 5.4% was achieved at a higher temperature of 353 K. The hydrogen-evolution rate was shown to be improved monotonically from 29.4 to 131.6 μmol h−1 as the temperature increases from 298 to 353 K at ambient pressure. The temperature dependency points out its drawback and limits the economic viability of Co–P modified BP photocatalysts. A high STH value of 5% was also reported for pristine cobalt oxide (CoO) nanoparticles by Jiming Bao and co-workers [19]. The nanocrystalline CoO was synthesized from micron-sized CoO powder by two separate approaches (mechanical ball milling and femtosecond laser ablation) and the efficiency achieved was attributed to the shift in the band edge position. However, the synthesized CoO nanoparticles were found to be unstable and become deactivated after 1 h of reaction. Even though the deactivated nanoparticles remained as CoO single crystals, they do not exhibit the sharp facets as before as they seem to have been corroded or oxidized. Furthermore, several transition metal oxynitrides and nitrides have been widely studied for OWS because of their intense absorption of visible light. For example, Ta3N5 single-crystal nanorods free from grain boundaries were selectively formed on the ends of lattice-matched cubic KTaO3 particles and used for OWS in presence of Rh/Cr2O3 cocatalyst [20]. LaMgxTa1 – x O1+3x N2−3x (x = 1/3) are another class of archetypal oxynitrides based on d0 electronic configurations that are synthesized from solid solutions of two perovskite-type materials (the complex oxide LaMg2/3Ta1/3O3 and the oxynitride LaTaON2) and it is the first example of OWS occurring at 600 nm. The LaMg1/3Ta2/3O2N photocatalysts exhibited an AQE of 0.03% (440 ± 30 nm), 0.031% (500 ± 30 nm), and 0.0048% (560 ± 30 nm) [21]. Kudo and Kato showed that doping of NaTaO3 with Ba, Sr, La, Nd, Sm, Pr, Gd, Dy, and Tb lanthanides can enhance the photocatalytic water splitting activity [22,23]. Lanthanum was the most successful dopant and the NiO/Na–TaO3:La photocatalyst yielded an AQY of 56% at 270 nm [24]. Orthorhombic alkaline-earth tantalates ATa2O6 (A = Ca, Ba, and Sr), in the sequence of SrTa2O6 > BaTa2O6 > CaTa2O6, are also capable of photocatalytic water splitting [25,26]. Metal chalcogenides photocatalysts also exhibit OWS due to their visible light responsiveness, effective charge transfer, and adequate band synchronization with the redox potentials. A widely studied catalyst of this class is CdS and recently its surface modification with Pt (reduction co-catalyst) and Ru (tpy)(bpy)Cl2 (oxidation co-catalyst) was reported [27,28a]. Although the chalcogenides have proven to be potential solar water harvesters, they are not durable against photocorrosion as their S2− and Se2− are more sensitive to self-oxidation by excited holes than the water oxidation process. An effective strategy to stabilize the sulfide system is the incorporation of S 3p with O 2p orbitals to produce oxysulfides which increases the stability of lattice S2− ions. An advance in this direction occurred with the development of a Y2Ti2O5S2 photocatalyst by Domen and co-workers in 2019 [28b]. The material characterizations inferred the potentiality of the catalyst in both one-step and Z-scheme water-splitting systems. The OWS reaction was carried out with Y2Ti2O5S2 deposited with IrO2 and a core/shell Rh/Cr2O3. The Rh/Cr2O3/IrO2-loaded Y2Ti2O5S2 yielded a maximum AQE of 0.36% (420 nm), 0.23% (500 nm), and 0.05% (600 nm) at the reaction pH of 8.5. Even though the AQE of Y2Ti2O5S2 is low but it offers novel concepts for activating and stabilizing sulfide-based photocatalysts, which are commonly thought to be unstable against hole oxidation. The conjugated polymers have also been used as an OWS photocatalyst due to their delocalized π system and varied synthetic modularity. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), a metal-free polymer semiconductor with a bandgap of 2.7 eV has been shown to yield OWS [29,30]. The VBM and CBM of g-C3N4 are formed of N2pz and C2pz orbitals, respectively. Thus, upon light irradiation, holes are generated by the nitrogen atoms for the OER, and electrons by the carbon atoms for the HER [30,31]. Wang et al. achieved OWS with g-C3N4 modified with Pt, CoOx, and PtOx [32]. Furthermore, Liu J.et al. reported CDots-C3N4 composites made of low-cost, environmentally benign materials, which can split water into H2 and O2 with QEs of 16% (λ = 420 ± 20 nm) and 6.29% (λ = 580 ± 15 nm). The calculated overall STH conversion efficiency for the CDots-C3N4 composites was 2.0% [33]. Though the theoretical calculations and lab-scale experiments proved the photocatalyst to be highly stable, their practical application with seawater showed a decreased activity with an STH conversion efficiency of just 0.45% with a QE of 3.86% at 420 nm. Moreover, specific studies to understand the underline reason for the observed STH of 2% have not been investigated. Lately, 1,3-diyne-linked conjugated polymer nanosheets formed by oxidative coupling of terminal alkynes have exhibited OWS. The extremely thin sheet-like structure with huge surface areas and high mobility charge carriers assured that the photo-induced charges could instantly enter the surface of polymer for redox reactions resisting unfavorable recombination of electron-hole pairs. For the system, an AQE of 10% (420 nm) and about 0.6% STH conversion efficiency was obtained [34]. One of the most important issues for practical application of the PPWS system is reproducibility and to date, no further studies have reported similar results for CoO, black phosphorous, and g-C3N4 based systems. 2.1.2 Two-step photoexcitation catalysts for water splitting Inspired by natural photosynthesis, the two-step photoexcitation system (Z scheme) incorporates two separate photocatalysts that produce H2 and O2 (Fig. 2 (b)). In the H2 evolution photocatalyst (HEP), photogenerated electrons reduce H+ to H2, and in an O2 evolution photocatalyst (OEP) the holes oxidize H2O to O2. In the Z scheme system, recombination of photoexcited charge carriers’ can take place via solid-state electron mediator or through a redox mediator [35]. In general, this mechanism can use semiconductors that have a more positive CBM compared to H+/H2 reduction potential or a more negative VBM compared to the O2/H2O potential. It is an 8-electron process unlike the 4-electron process in the one-step photoexcitation system implying that to obtain a similar STH, the QE required is twice that of the one-step photoexcitation system. The two-step OWS method was first reported in 2001 for amalgamated anatase (HEP) and rutile (OEP) phases of TiO2 [36]. The IO3 −/I− was used as an aqueous redox mediator with a redox potential of +0.67 V V NHE (pH 7). To accomplish a two-step photoexcited OWS, several narrow-bandgap semiconductors have been utilized. In particular, the key materials investigated as HEPs are SrTiO3: Rh-based photocatalysts, oxy-nitrides and oxy-sulphides such as MgTa2O6– x Ny/TaON, Sm2Ti2S2O5 and g-C3N4, and CdS [31,37–43]. Several photocatalysts such as WO3, BiVO4, Bi4NbO8Cl, TiO2:Cr/Sb, and Ta3N5 have been utilized as potential photo-responsive OEPs [37,44–46]. To facilitate the charge carrier transport between HEP and OEP various redox couples are conventionally used, such as IO3 −/I−, Fe3+ /Fe2+ , [Co(phen)3]3+/2+ , [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ , [Fe(CN)6]3−/[Fe(CN)6]4− , and [SiW11O39MnIII(H2O)]5−/[SiW11O39MnII(H2O)]6− [37,39,46]. Miseki Y. et al. constructed a Z-scheme photocatalytic system with Fe-H-Cs-WO3 and Ru/SrTiO3:Rh photocatalysts capable of producing O2 and H2 independently with the help of a novel VO2+/VO2+ redox mediator. The efficiency of the system was tested for a one-pot and stepwise process and a solar to hydrogen energy conversion of 0.03% and 0.06% were obtained [39b]. A ZrO2/TaON (HEP) photocatalysts were developed with Pt/WO3 (OEP) for two-step water splitting under monochromatic visible light irradiation with AQYs of 6% at 420.5 nm [43]. The AQY was further improved to 6.8% at 420 nm by using MgTa2O6-xNy/TaON heterostructure with PtOx-WO3 as the OEP and IO3-/I− as a redox mediator [42]. Tantalum nitride (Ta3N5) has a theoretical STH conversion efficiency of 15.9% and is one of the promising photocatalysts for water splitting reactions. Barium-modified Ta3N5 (HEP) with PtOx/WO3 (OEP) has been reported for water splitting in presence of IO3 –/I− pairs as a redox mediator [42,43]. Many oxysulfides have been successfully used as HEPs for Z Scheme water splitting reactions although the STH values are very low. One such system is Sm2Ti2O5S2 as HEP coupled with WO3 as the OEP and the I3 −/I− redox mediator with an STH of 3 × 10−3% (approx.) [39]. Other oxysulfide catalysts such as Pt/NiS–La5Ti2AgO7S5, La5Ti2CuO7S5, and La6Ti2O5S8 have also been used as HEPs for water splitting in a two-step photoexcitation process [47]. Recently, modified HCa2Nb3O10 nanosheets were sensitized by Ru(II) tris-diimine complex with WO3-based OEP, and an iodide/iodide redox couple have been used for water splitting. Furthermore, incorporation of amorphous Al2O3 clusters to the Pt intercalated HCa2Nb3O10 nanosheets accounts for the highest reported AQY of 2.4% at 420 nm for dye-sensitized photocatalyst [48]. Compare to liquid redox mediator, in a solid-state electron mediator system the transfer of charge carriers occurs between a HEP and an OEP through a solid electron mediator or interface contact. The first report of solid-state two-step OWS was on a mixture of Ru/SrTiO3:Rh and BiVO4 semiconductors [49]. Numerous materials such as Ir, Rh, Ni, Ag, Au, Pt, reduced graphene oxide, and carbon dots have been tested as solid-state electron mediators [50–53]. A visible-light-driven Z-scheme OWS system with ZrO2/TaON as HEP, BiVO4 as OEP and [Fe(CN)6]3-/[Fe(CN)6]4- as a redox mediator was reported to have an AQE value of 10% (420 nm) [54]. The Au and CoOx dual co-catalysts were selectively deposited at the electron-rich {010} and hole-rich {110} facets of BiVO4 and the metallic Au transfers the electron from BiVO4 to [Fe(CN)6]3-, thus facilitating the oxidation of water. The STH conversion efficiency of the system was 0.5%, however, after fine-tuning of the {110} and {010} facets ratio on the BiVO4 resulted in the highest quantum efficiency of 71% for the Z-scheme water-splitting photocatalyst without any back reactions. Moreover, the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of the system was increased to 1.8% [55b]. In recent years, attempts have been made to develop a photocatalytic sheet system for OWS. In this method, the photocatalysts are coated on a conducting sheet instead of suspended particulate photocatalysts. Wang et al. prepared Ru/Cr2O3-loaded SrTiO3: La, and BiVO4: Mo as the OEP, while Rh was used as the HEP and Au as the conductive layer [56]. The OEP and HEP particles were connected electrically by the back contact layer for efficient charge transfer. An AQE of 33% (419 nm) and an STH of 1.1% at 331 K were recorded for a photocatalytic sheet system. In the ensuing work, the WS back reaction was minimized by replacing the conductive Au layer with a carbon film and thus increasing the STH to 1.2% at 331 K and 10 kPa [57]. As a major development to the OWS, the photocatalyst sheet model is an emerging method in which the photocatalysts can be quickly separated and substituted from the system when necessary. The OWS efficiency of some of the potential photocatalysts is shown in Table 1 ."
3,Hydrogen production via photocatalytic reforming,"2.2 Hydrogen production via photocatalytic reforming The OWS is a challenging process and only a few photocatalysts are known to split water with high AQE and STH conversion efficiency. One of the major obstacles in OWS is the quick recombination rate of the photogenerated electrons and holes. One method of suppressing the recombination rate and producing the renewable H2 from water is to use a hole scavenger [58,59,109,110]. Using the scavengers or sacrificial reagents containing oxygenated organic compounds (OOCs) such as glycerol, ethanol, methanol, glucose, etc. in the aqueous solutions can enable the conversion of renewable sunlight energy into useful H2 gas via photo-oxidation of the sacrificial reagent combined with the water-splitting process. This photo-reforming process is a substitute method for H2 production. Furthermore, the risk of backward reaction can be suppressed as O2 is not produced in the system, which can result in an enhanced H2 evolution rate [60,61,113]. The water-splitting reaction is a chemically uphill reaction demanding a Gibbs free energy change of ΔG = +237 kJ mol−1. The sacrificial reagent-based photocatalytic system is also an uphill reaction, but the energy requirements are less compared to the pure water-splitting system. For instance, the Gibbs free energy change for the H2 evolution from the methanol reagent-based system is +9.3 kJ mol−1 [62]. The selection of a sacrificial agent for a photocatalytic reaction depends on its redox potentials w.r.t. the photocatalysts and their adsorption on the surface of the photocatalysts [116]. Alcohols are more frequently used as a sacrificial agent for photocatalytic H2 generation, specifically with TiO2-based photocatalysts, as the alcohol groups contain more α –H and OH groups which directly leads to a higher H2 production rate. Glycerol and methanol are some of the most used alcohols for sacrificial agent-based H2 production [114,115]. Photocatalytic oxidation of methanol has two probable pathways as described by the previous studies [63–66]. Firstly, the direct oxidation by photogenerated holes present in the medium, and the second one is the oxidation of methanol by •OH radicals generated in the solution. These •OH radical species are produced from the OH− groups or adsorbed water molecules on the surface when they trap the valence band holes. Due to the limited probe techniques, it is really difficult to differentiate between the two mechanisms in experimental conditions. The reaction pathways produce different by-products depending on the structure of the scavengers [67]. For example, methanol decomposes into CO2 and H2, while ethanol and 2-propanol yield methane as a by-product. The hydrogen atoms attached to the alpha carbon in the compounds play an important role in the oxidation mechanism. It is possible to predict the amount of H2 evolved by counting the number of alpha-hydrogen atoms present in the structure [67,68]. Consequently, glycerol and methanol show higher photocatalytic activities as their all-carbon atoms contain alpha hydrogen. Nevertheless, the yield of the H2 production can be reduced subsequently as the level of sacrificial agents in the reaction system is decreased. These sacrificial reagents can be classified based on the presence of various oxygenated organic electron donor groups such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, carbonyl, saccharides, and amines, as well as the raw biomass feedstock. The ratio of H2 produced from water and sacrificial reagent can be calculated using the following equation and presented in Table 2 . (10) C m H n O k + ( 2 m - k ) H 2 O → mCO 2 + ( 2 m + ( n/ 2 ) - k ) H 2 The scavenger methanol has a less energy requirement (9:3 kJ mol−1) compared to other scavengers of the same class and is most frequently used for photocatalytic H2 production. Y. Okamoto et al. reported AQE of 65% at 300 nm for Rhodium-doped calcium niobate nanosheets in water/methanol solution. During the reaction process, methanol was first oxidized by holes to formaldehyde, then to formic acid, and finally to carbon dioxide. Usage of a long carbon chain alcohol like ethanol results in more requirement of energy (97.4 kJ mol−1) compared to methanol. Q. Xiang et al. obtained an AQE of 9.7% at 365 nm in water/ethanol solution for TiO2 photocatalyst with 0.5 wt % MoS2/graphene co-catalyst [69]. The complex monools such as butanol, 2- butanol, propanol, 2-propanol also demonstrated H2 production via photo-reforming process [70–73]. Polyols are expected to yield higher photocatalytic H2 production via the photoreforming process compared to alcohols as they contain multiple hydroxyl groups. D. Tristantini et al. reported an AQE of 37.36% in the 10 vol % glycerol/water solution with Pt (1%)-N-TiNT photocatalyst [74]. Similarly, Valentina Gombac et al. showed that the CuOx-TiO2 photocatalyst produced H2 with an AQE of 29% in the presence of glycerol scavenger [75]. Chen et al. also demonstrated that the oxidation potential and polarity of the alcohols could affect the H2 generation rate at low vol% (>15) aqueous sacrificial agent solution and glycerol produced the maximum H2 generation rate, and the other compound followed the order of ethanol < methanol < glycerol [76]. M. Tahir et al. studied the effects of various hole-scavengers such as methanol, Na2S, and Na2SO3, phenol, glycerol towards dynamic H2 evolution and compared the different alcohols-water mixtures for photocatalytic H2 evolution over Au-WO3/TiO2 catalyst under solar light irradiation. They observed that the 10% (v/v) glycerol: water mixture produces the highest H2 and reported a ∼9 fold enhancement in H2 production with an apparent quantum yield of 28.3% at ʎ∼420 nm [187,189]. Similarly, Tasleem et al. reported higher H2 production with glycerol over Ni2P/Ti3AlC2/TiO2 heterostructure photocatalysts [188]. The photoreforming H2 production depends on the number of hydroxyl groups present in the sacrificial reagent. Monools such as ethanol and methanol has only one hydroxyl group, ethylene glycol as diols has two and glycerol has three, which is one of the main reason for higher activity shown by glycerol with metal oxides based photocatalysts. Therefore, the higher the amount of hydroxyl groups present, the higher is the sacrificial H2 evolution over the photocatalyst [190]. Kumaravel V et al. studied the H2 production activity of three promising photocatalysts TiO2–P25, CdS, and g-C3N4 with several sacrificial agents such as methanol, ethanol, glycerol, isopropanol [191]. They concluded that glycerol and glucose are the most recommended sacrificial agents for an oxide photocatalyst while triethanolamine is for polymeric and metal sulfide-based photocatalysts. The carboxylic acid groups have also been used efficiently as a scavenger for H2 production. For example, NiS/CdS photocatalysts in lactic acid aqueous solution showed an AQE of 51.3% at λ > 420 nm [77]. Recently, Zhang et al. reported urea derived g-C3N4 coupled with P3H with a broad visible light absorption (400–700 nm) could offer an efficiency of 10.7% at λ ≥ 500 nm and at λ = 420 nm, the AQE increased to 77.4% in a water/ascorbic acid medium [78]. Yue et al. observed that a metallic MoP co-catalyst could improve the H2 production activity of CdS photocatalyst in the lactic acid medium with a 16.7% quantum efficiency (λ > 420 nm) [79]. Recently, Wang X et al. [184], reported 93.08% quantum efficiency in ascorbic acid-water media for Sv-ZnIn2S4/MoSe2 photocatalyst at 380 nm. Similarly, carbonyl groups such as aldehydes have been effectively used in the H2 production. Formaldehyde is the simplest form of aldehyde and a potential candidate for photocatalytic H2 evolution [80–82]. The H2 production rate of the aldehyde group decreases with an increase in the carbon chain length [83]. Complex aldehydes like glyceraldehyde, acetaldehyde, butyraldehyde, and benzaldehyde have also been reported for H2 production [84]. However, the photocatalytic H2 evolution from aldehydes is not as efficient as from alcohols. The other group explored as a scavenger for photocatalytic H2 production includes amines. Amines groups such as trimethylamine, triethanolamine, and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid have attained much attention as a sacrificial agent for the photo-reforming process [85,86]. A metal-free, visible light-responsive photocatalyst and organic material g-C3N4 have shown superior photocatalytic H2 production activity in the triethanolamine medium compared to other scavengers. Junying Xu et al. reported that EY-sensitized g-C3N4 synthesized from urea shows an apparent quantum yield of 18.8% (λ > 420 nm) [87a]. Martin et al. [87b] reported a quantum yield of 26.5% (420 nm) for structurally modified g-C3N4 in the presence of triethanolamine. Furthermore, the saccharide class containing monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides has also been used as a scavenger. The photo-reforming efficiency of saccharides depends on their geometrical arrangement of C: H ratio and availability of α-hydrogen. Fu et al. observed that the H2 production activity in presence of saccharides decreases and follows the order of monosaccharide (glucose) > disaccharide (sucrose) > polysaccharide (starch) depending on their structural degree [88]. Silva et al. reported that the H2 generation rate of Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts reduces in the order of arabinose > glucose > fructose > cellobiose [89]. The H2 production rate in presence of saccharides is lower than carbonyl, hydroxyl, amines, and carboxyl groups. According to Carraro et al. the H2 generation rate declines in the order of ethanol > glycerol > glucose [90]. The AQE reported for saccharide photo reforming is very less. For instance, Andrea Speltini et al. reported a quantum yield of 1.1 × 10−2 and 0.8 × 10−2 for glucose and sucrose, respectively [91]. Furthermore, several other biomass-derived products have been used as a scavenger for photocatalytic H2 production such as olive oil, green plant, green algae, paper, sawdust, etc. [92–95]. However, the photocatalytic H2 production efficiency of raw biomass feedstock is very low. The Na2S/Na2SO3 mixture is also one the most explored inorganic sacrificial reagent which is mainly used with the metal sulfide photocatalysts such as CdSe, and CdS [111,112] Hongjian Yan et al. reported an AQE of 93% (420 nm) [Fig. 5 ] for H2 evolution using sulfide and sulfite as a sacrificial reagent [96]. Recently, Liu M et al. [186], achieved a quantum efficiency ∼ 100% (425 nm) using Na2S/Na2SO3 as sacrificial agent for Pt/NixS/Cd0·5Zn0·5S photocatalyst (Fig. 5). Wang et al. study the H2 production activity of g-C3N4, TiO2, and Zn0·5Cd0·5S photocatalysts in presence of various sacrificial agents. The g-C3N4 showed the best activity with TEOA compare to methanol and Na2S/Na2SO3 reagents, while TiO2 and Zn0·5Cd0·5S exhibited the higher activity with methanol and Na2S/Na2SO3 medium, respectively [116]. The sacrificial agent TEOA possess a lower oxidation potential and a higher permittivity compared to other amines of the same class [117] and Na2S/Na2SO3 gives the best H2 production activity when they are used with sulfide photocatalysts as it can reduce the self-photo-corrosion of the photocatalysts [111,116]. Photocatalytic water splitting combined with photo reforming of oxygenated carbon compounds is one of the alternatives and feasible approaches to H2 production. The H2 production from photo-reforming of oxygenated carbon compounds could provide enhanced activity, stability, and efficiency than that of OWS. The most common materials explored for the photo-reforming of a range of oxygenated carbon compounds are Metal oxides, metal sulfides, and semiconducting polymers. The oxygenated carbon compounds like crude glycerol or bio-ethanol are considered as H2 carriers as they demonstrated tremendously higher H2 production rates by photo-reforming, as shown in Fig. 5 and Table 3 . Choosing the right sacrificial agent and its amount in a particulate photocatalytic hydrogen production system is crucial to achieving higher H2 production [118] (see Table 4 )."
4,Factors affecting particulate photocatalytic water splitting reaction,"2.3 Factors affecting particulate photocatalytic water splitting reaction Several factors, as mentioned below, can affect the water-splitting efficiency of the PPWS system. Controlling these parameters simultaneously or sequentially is a time and energy-consuming and tedious process. However, achieving the targeted STH conversion efficiency of 10% required that these parameters be optimized and evaluated for a PPWS system. 2.3.1 The crystallinity/morphology of the photocatalyst The morphology and crystallinity of the particulate photocatalysts affect the H2 production rate. A larger surface area provides a higher number of reactive sites which in turn produces more H2 [97,98]. The smaller-sized photocatalysts have the benefit that their photo-induced charge carriers can speedily transport to the reaction sites on the photocatalytic surface, consequently reducing the recombination rate [99]. The synthesis techniques adopted greatly influence the structure and morphology of the photocatalysts; different temperatures, surfactants, and pH values can directly affect the structures, shapes, and crystal sizes. For instance, acid (HNO3) treated graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) exhibited a better H2 production rate compared to the bare one though they were prepared under the same experimental conditions [100]. This occurred because of the protonation of g-C3N4 which promotes exfoliation of the graphitic carbon nitride structures and generates ultra-small pores. These ultra-small pores help in the charge transfer properties. Therefore, the morphology/crystallinity and structure of the photocatalyst can influence the H2 production activity in the particulate photocatalytic system. 2.3.2 Responsiveness to visible light The minimum energy required to split water is 1.23 eV and a semiconductor material with bandgap energy larger than this is required for achieving an effective photocatalytic WS reaction. Unfortunately, the majority of the photocatalytic systems tried over the decades for this process have bandgap energy larger than 3.0 eV. Even though a wider bandgap semiconductor can facilitate efficient charge transfer, it results in shorter wavelength absorption. Usage of UV irradiation with wavelengths shorter than 350 nm would largely hinder the solar light absorption in higher fractions as visible light constitutes 43% of the solar light spectrum and higher STH can be achieved by designing a visible light photocatalyst [8a]. Several strategies have been developed for effective photon absorption without violating the thermodynamic constraints of photocatalysis as summarized below [178]: • Up-conversion process: It is possible to change the absorption behavior of a wide bandgap photocatalyst by doping it with rare earth metals such as Ln+3 and Er+3. Doping can alter the light absorption, charge carrier generation, and transport properties of the photocatalysts via the intermediate 4f states of the rare earth metal cations [177a] [177b]. To date, there have been very few reports on actual water splitting with rare earth metals based up-conversion process [177c], and it remains largely unexplored. • Lattice defects and Inter-band states: Decreasing the bandgap of a semiconductor is an effective approach to extend the light absorption of the photocatalysts while upholding its redox properties. In wide-bandgap metal oxides, the VB is made of O 2p orbitals and to achieve OWS necessitates that the bandgap is greater than or equal to 3eV. The bandgap can be tuned towards visible light absorption by hybridization of the s or p orbitals of p-block metal ions or anions with the O 2p orbitals, respectively while fulfilling the redox conditions. For instance, the addition of N leads to the hybridization of N 2p orbitals with O 2p, which ultimately reduces the bandgap of the material and may introduce the inter-band states [178]. The optical and electronic properties of the semiconductor photocatalysts can also be altered by doping of foreign metal ions such as Cr3+, Fe3+, Ni2+, V4+, Rh3+, and Mn3+ [8]. • Plasmonic materials: The absorption properties of the wide bandgap photocatalysts can also be modified by coupling with plasmonic metal nanoparticles such as Au, Pt, Ag, Ru. Such modification helps to improve the photocatalytic activity by facilitating the visible light absorption and charge carrier separation efficiency due to their Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) properties. In such a system, the LSPR gets converted into hot electrons and holes on the plasmonic material surface, and these hot charge carriers move to the semiconductor surface. The LSPR of noble metal nanoparticles have been extensively modified across the visible-near infrared region by changing their composition, size, and shape [(179a)] • Solid Solutions: Solid solutions of isostructural semiconductors voluntarily undergo orbital hybridization between various atoms resulting in changes in the band structures. They are also used as supporting agents to enhance photocatalytic properties. Charles et al. have reviewed the achievements made in the solid solutions mixture for photocatalytic HER, OER, and also in the OWS reactions [180]. • Use of Dye Sensitizer: Use of a dye sensitizer is also proved to be an effective approach to extend light absorption. Even though a sensitizer doesn't act as a catalyst, it aids the photocatalysts in the photocatalytic reaction by absorbing visible light. The electrons from the sensitizer are readily injected into the wide bandgap semiconductor after the light absorption, which reduces protons to hydrogen [181]. For example, the OWS activity of KTa(Zr)O3 was enhanced when porphyrinoids were used as light harvesters [8]. The dye sensitizer can improve light absorption by d-d, π−π*, metal to ligand, or ligand to metal charge transition. 2.3.3 Charge carrier separation and transport The particulate photocatalytic system has quite a lot of advantages because of its simple design. However, it possesses certain technical challenges such as poor charge carrier separation and transport as well as the water-splitting back reactions. Firstly, upon light irradiation photogenerated charge carriers are formed in the semiconductor. These charge carriers are expected to transfer to the surface of the photocatalyst and continue separated as long as the desired redox reaction takes place. But the shorter lifetime of the charge carriers resulted in quick recombination on the order of nanoseconds, even before they can participate in the redox reactions. While the water reduction half-reaction takes place in milliseconds, the oxidation half-reaction can take seconds to occur. To complete the redox reactions, photogenerated carriers must reach the active sites on the photocatalyst surfaces and interfacial charge transfer and separation is necessary for this to occur. To address this challenge, several strategies as mentioned below have been adopted. Decreasing the particle size of a photocatalyst is one of the most straightforward methods to reduce the charge carrier diffusion distance. The experimental methods, synthesis conditions, and also the precursors used can affect the particle size of a photocatalyst. Kato et al. have demonstrated that improved OWS can be achieved with a smaller particle size of NiO-loaded NaTaO3:La with an AQY of 56% at 270 nm [24]. Metal-semiconductor or semiconductor-semiconductor heterojunctions can be used to extend the charge carrier lifetime. Coupling metal nanoparticles with a photocatalyst are beneficial for the separation of charge carrier via the formation of the Schottky barrier. The Fermi levels or band edges at the metal-semiconductor are positioned in such a way that the carriers would eventually accumulate themselves on the opposite sides of the junction. If a metal of a lower Fermi energy compared to the semiconductor comes in contact with the semiconductor then it will lead to the transfer of electrons from the semiconductor to the metal. The resultant band bending at the interface gives a Schottky barrier which inhibits the back-transfer of the electron [178]. Therefore, the metal nanoparticles not only help in the separation of the charge carriers but also improve the light absorption via the surface plasmon resonance effect [199]. Similarly, efficient charge separation can also be achieved through interface contact between two semiconductors. In conventional Type II photocatalytic systems, as shown in Fig. 2(b), the electron and holes transfer in opposite directions ultimately lead to effective separation of the charge carriers [178]. However, improved charge-carrier separation efficiency is obtained at the cost of reduced redox ability from the thermodynamic perspective in Type II photocatalytic systems. The photogenerated electrons accumulate on the less negative CB and the holes on the less positive VB, resulting in weakened reduction and oxidation abilities. Realization of effective charge carrier separation while upholding the high redox capabilities is possible in Z-scheme photocatalytic systems. The natural photosynthesis process in plants follows the Z-scheme mechanism. There are three types of Z-scheme systems, the traditional redox mediator Z-scheme, solid-state Z-scheme, and the direct Z-scheme photocatalytic systems. The Z-scheme mechanism of charge transfer is one of the promising methods in photocatalysis, where the more energetic carriers are used in the reactions while the less energetic carriers recombine [37,39], [200]. However, the Z-scheme also has its limitations such as the difficulties in finding the appropriate redox mediators, its application limited to the solution phase, stability of the redox mediators. The solid-state Z-scheme abolishes the requirement of a redox mediator by replacing it with a nano-sized conductor and in the direct Z-scheme, both the semiconductors form close interface bonding for charge separation [201]. Recently, another mechanism called S-scheme heterojunction has been proposed by Fu and co-workers [202]. The S-type heterojunction system forms between two semiconductors, one is oxidation photocatalyst (OP) which has a higher work function and lower Fermi level and the other is reduction photocatalyst (RP), which has a higher Fermi level and lower work function. In such a system, the electrons from RP will transfer to OP across their interface, forming an electric field directing from RP to OP. Ultimately, the oxidation reaction is initiated at the valence band of OP and reduction takes place at the conduction band of RP. Therefore, the Z-scheme, S-scheme, and Type II photocatalytic systems are promising mechanisms to enhance charge separation and transport [199,203]. Recently, the positive effect of structural defects of the photocatalyst for photocatalytic H2 production reactions has also been explored using g-C3N4 photocatalyst. In such studies, some defects such as shallow trap sites can aid in improving the charge carrier separation and overall photocatalytic performance [182a] [182b] 2.3.4 Water splitting back reaction Another challenging issue in OWS is the back reaction of produced H2 and O2, which tend to recombine in the reaction system to form water again. This is an unfortunate event as it causes a product to lose and hence a loss of efficiency. It is necessary to avoid backward reactions to achieve high photocatalytic efficiency. Several strategies are effectively employed to suppress the backward reactions. For instance, Perfluorodecalin has been used to stop the back reaction, as it can dissolve the oxygen and reduce its amount in the reactor [(183a)]. Another approach employed is to deposit a thin layer of Cr2O3 on the photocatalyst surface as Cr2O3 hinders the entry of O2 molecules from reaching to H2 evolution sites [6]. Also, Mo coating was used in the overall water splitting reaction using Pt/SrTiO3 photocatalyst to inhibit the backward reaction. It was observed that the Mo coating was stable in acidic media for long hours of photocatalysis [(183b)]. Besides it is also reported that the addition of a small amount of I− into the suspension of Pt–TiO2 photocatalyst can effectively suppress the backward reaction over the Pt surface [(183c)]. 2.3.5 The reaction temperature The reaction temperature doesn't influence the photocatalytic activity thermodynamically as it cannot help in the charge carrier generation. However, the operating temperature of the photocatalytic system can increase desorption of products from the photocatalyst surface which promotes the photocatalytic activity and helps to increase the reaction rate. The effect of temperature on activity may vary from catalyst to catalyst. Reduced temperature gives a negative impact on the H2 generation activity as desorption of the products becomes slower compared to adsorption of the reactants to the catalyst surface. When the temperature is high, it facilitates the charge carrier's transfer from valance band to higher energy states which makes the photocatalytic system more effective against charge carrier recombination that ultimately leads to higher H2 generation rates [101]. For example, the optimal reaction temperature for the TiO2 photocatalyst was studied by Zhang and Maggard [102] and they observed that it showed the best activity when the reaction temperature range was in-between 60–80 °C. Their studies further confirmed that lesser temperatures have a detrimental effect on the H2 evolution rate. Similarly, L. Huaxu et al. reported that Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst exhibited an increased photocatalytic activity from 4.71 mmol/g to 15.18 mmol/g in 4 h upon a reaction temperature variation from 45 °C to 55 °C [103]. 2.3.6 Intensity of the light source The productivity of a particulate photocatalytic water splitting system is a function of incident photon absorption. The efficiency can be enhanced by improving the photon absorption with energies more than the activation threshold [104,105] Tambago and Leon have demonstrated that the H2 evolution activity of Cd0·4Zn0·6S photocatalysts was enhanced by two times when the irradiance of light was increased from 33 mW/cm2 to 70 mW/cm2 [106]. Furthermore, Baniasadi et al. studied the variation in photocatalytic H2 evolution rate in a ZnS-based photocatalytic system and reported that the photocatalyst exhibited 20% higher H2 production activity when the light intensity was increased from 900 to 1000 W/m2 [107]. The electromagnetic spectrum of UV irradiation can be divided into three parts, UV-A (315–400 nm), UV-B (280–315 nm), and UV-C (100–280 nm). In most of the studies, the UV-A light provides light photons sufficient for photonic activation of the catalyst. UV-C is absorbed by the atmosphere before reaching the earth's surface. So, only the lamp-driven photoreactor system can utilize UV-C irradiation artificially for photonic activation of the catalyst [108]. 2.3.7 The solution pH The influence of pH on water splitting is dependent on the type of reaction system under study. On considering the OWS systems, most of the photocatalysts work at the normal pH of 6.7–6.9, and no apparent change in the pH of the water before and after the reaction is expected as the stoichiometric decomposition of pure water will balance the concentration of the H+ and OH− generated. While the pH seems to have a great dependence on certain catalysts as there are many redox mediators, HER and OER catalysts are involved. Upon acidification of a reaction solution, there is a difference in the electrostatic forces between the reactant molecules, and this change in the isoelectric point of each system affects the adsorption of the mediator ions to the photocatalyst which in turn increases the H2 production. In systems like BiVO4/Fe (III) [55], Ru/SrTiO3:Rh– BiVO4 [49] and GaN:ZnO solid solution [17], adjusting the pH leads to improved interparticle electron transfer, which helps in the H2 production activity. In H2 production via photoreforming, the adsorption of the sacrificial agent on the semiconductor has a crucial role in determining the pH conditions of the system [119]. If the proton concentration in the photocatalytic system increases, it promotes the protonation of the photocatalyst at low pH conditions. Thus, the pH conditions of the particulate photocatalytic system are typically close to the electron donor's pKa value [120]. The tertiary aliphatic amines are commonly used electron donors in the photocatalytic systems and triethylamine (TEA) (pKa 10.7) and TEOA (pKa 7.9) form an alkaline medium (pH > 8) [121]. The capability of amine groups to offer two electrons from each absorbed photon and their irreversible oxidation is favorable for their performance. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), which is a tertiary amine, can also act as an electron donor at lower pH (5–7) conditions [121,122]. Ascorbic acid (pKa 4 and 11.3) is also broadly used as an electron donor as well as a proton donor to produce H2 under moderately acidic conditions [121]. Carboxylic acids, such as oxalic acid (pKa 1.2 and 4.2) and lactic acid (pKa 3.9) are also well explored in particulate photocatalytic systems over a varied pH range from mildly acidic to alkaline [123]. Hence, it is important to work at a pH that is close to the pKa of the electron donor used in the system to improve the H2 production activity. 2.3.8 Reactors design Current research on photocatalytic H2 production is mainly focused on laboratory-scale setup with suspensions of powder catalyst in quartz, borosilicate, or flask-type glass reactors [124,125]. Most of these reactor systems are of 100–1000 mL capacity and they produce only a small amount of H2. Also, it is a common trend in literature that the amount of H2 produced is extrapolated per gram of catalysts used. However, practically when the amount of catalyst is increased, the rate of H2 evolution decreases within the same reactor system, as the number of light penetration decreases and the catalysts tend to aggregate. Several reaction parameters related to the reactor design affect the photocatalytic H2 production such as the amount of catalysts and water used, shape and size of the reactor, thickness of the reactor, material of the reactor (quartz, borosilicate, etc.), and distance of the light source, illumination intensity, and uniformity of the light intensity. Several types of reactors such as batch type photoreactor, continuous type of reactor, semi-batch type photoreactor have been utilized. However, these systems are not suitable for large-scale applications as they have certain limitations. A high amount of water is required for large-scale application, so reactor manufacturing tends to be costly and the particulate photocatalysts tend to settle down at the bottom of the reactor when the reaction mixture is not continuously stirred, and thus lack to utilize the incident photons energy efficiently [128c]. Recently, few review articles on reactor design have summarized these aspects in greater detail. For example, Takashi Hisatomi et al. discussed the limitation of conventional flask-type reactors and envisioned the penal type reactors as a potential solution for large-scale H2 production [128a]. Rohini and coworkers numerically evaluated the combined effects of device design, concentrations of semiconductor particles, and redox shuttles in a vertically stacked particle suspension reactor [128d]. Kevin et al. used a UV-irradiated fluidized bed/separator reactor for water splitting and compared the experimental data with the mathematical modeling for the Pt-deposited TiO2 particle suspension system. It was shown that in the fluidized bed reactor system, the rate of H2 evolution and AQE are directly depending on the mass transfer in the separator unit [128e]. Nguyen et al. reviewed the various reactor systems and focused on a twin photoreactor system for simultaneous H2 production, CO2 conversion, and pollutants degradation applications [128f]. Recently, Muhammad Tahir and coworkers have discussed the recent advances in photo-reactors and compared the various types of gas and liquid phase photoreactors such as monolith, fixed bed, coated optical fiber, fluidized, and slurry types [204]. Among these reactors, the gas phase monolith photocatalytic reactor was reported to be more efficient because of its higher illuminated surface area, improved mass transfer, higher mechanical strength, and thermal stability compared to other reactors. Even though the most common annual slurry photocatalytic reactor has the advantage of higher surface illumination but it suffers from a low active contact area for the photocatalytic reaction and required continuous stirring. Sehar Tasleem et al. have studied and compared extensively the performance of slurry, fixed-bed, and monolith photocatalytic reactors using TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 photocatalyst in presence of visible and UV light under batch and continuous flow operation [208]. The slurry photocatalytic reactor has shown better H2 production performance compared to the monolith and fixed bed reactors under continuous mode and visible light irradiation, while the monolith photoreactor exhibited better performance under UV light. Interestingly, the monolith and fixed bed reactors have shown much-improved performance under batch mode compared to continuous mode under visible light irradiation. In another report, Muhammad Usman Azam et al. used a gas-phase continuous flow honeycomb monolithic reactor for H2 production using La/TiO2 photocatalyst and reported ∼9 times higher H2 production with monolith reactor in comparison to the slurry type reactor [205]. Furthermore, the calculated AQE and space yield was 1.4, and 4.5 fold higher in the monolith reactor than the slurry type photoreactor, and the photocatalyst exhibited more stability and reusability with the monolith reactor. Fajrina N et al. have shown that H2 production in a two-phase monolith reactor coated with Ag-montmorillonite/pCN-TiO2 photocatalysts is ∼9 and ∼12 fold higher than the two and three-phase fixed bed and slurry type reactors, respectively [206,207]. Another approach to improve the H2 production is by using a compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) with the photoreactor to increase the light incident on the catalyst's surface. Jing et al. designed a tubular reactor combined with a CPC which was made up of pyrex glass with an overall length of 1.5 m, and a maximum half incident angle of 14° [126]. In addition to the reactor design issues of light penetration depth, illuminated surface area, mass transport, active contact area, and continuous stirring requirements, the collection and filtration of the photocatalytic powder from the reactor solution for reusability is a challenging and important factor for cost reduction and long-term sustainability. To overcome these challenges, recent investigations have focused on an immobilized type photocatalytic system where the powder photocatalyst is coated on thin transparent sheets [127]. The particulate photocatalysts can be coated onto these thin substrates by drop cast techniques with the help of binders such as silica [128]. Schröder and coworkers designed a flat panel-type immobilized photocatalytic system with a light-acceptance area of 0.76 m2. The immobilized photocatalytic system was consisting of g-C3N4 photocatalyst and triethanolamine was used as a sacrificial agent, as shown in Fig. 6 (a, b) [129]. The reaction properties and STH efficiency determination of these immobilized type photocatalytic systems remain largely unexplored. The challenge in the immobilized photocatalytic system is to set up a scalable reactor with high STH efficiency that allows effective water-splitting along with the transfer of product gases. For more details about photocatalytic reaction systems, the readers are encouraged to read an excellent review article by Zheng Wang and coworkers [128c]” 2.3.9 Stirring of the reactor solution In a multi-phase photocatalytic system, the adsorption of the reactants and desorption of the products from the surface of the photocatalyst to the gas phase is an important factor, if the products (evolved H2 and O2) are allowed to stay longer on the photocatalyst surface, it can facilitate the back-oxidation reactions. This happens when the mass transfer of the products from the photocatalyst surface is sluggish than the reaction kinetics, which ultimately leads to the limitation of H2 and O2 evolution rates [130]. A previous report on experimental evidence of mass transfer limitations suggests that the UV light irradiated photocatalyst exhibited enhancement in the H2 production rates when the stirring rate increased from 350 rpm to 900 rpm [131]. This enhanced activity implies that the mass transfer confinements on boundary layers (the gas-liquid and solid-liquid interfaces) can be altered via increasing the stirring rate. K. Reilly et al. have shown that in the case of a fluidized bed/separator system, a severe mass transfer limitation in the liquid-gas interface (product separation) exists and when the surface area of the liquid-gas interface increased, the H2 evolution rates also increased significantly by 350% [132]. The mass transfer area, liquid level, and stirring rate should be carefully designed to avoid the limitations offered by mass transfer to the photocatalytic reaction. 2.3.10 Adsorption of sacrificial reagents On the photocatalysts surface adsorption and dissociation of molecules takes place consecutively. During the photoreforming process, oxidizing agents such as superoxide anions and hydroxyl radical may form on the surface of the photocatalysts and these radicals’ species may also be responsible for the oxidation of scavengers with the holes. The degree of hydrophobicity of the photocatalysts surface and adsorption capability of the scavenger can affect the H2 production activity. For example, the H2 production rate of g-C3N4 based photocatalysts is low in presence of alcohols but higher with triethanolamine scavenger due to poor adsorption of alcohols on the hydrophobic g-C3N4 surface [191]. The density of hydroxyl groups on the surface also affects the adsorption of scavengers. When it comes to alcohols, it has been found that the H2 production rate is higher with primary alcohols compared to secondary alcohols. For example, Tasleem et al. studied the photocatalytic activity of Ni2P/Ti3AlC2/TiO2 heterostructure with various alcohol sacrificial agents for photocatalytic H2 generation and observed that the H2 production rate increases in the order of ethanol (C2H6O) < methanol (CH4O) < ethylene glycol (C2H6O2) < glycerol (C3H8O3) [188] The H2 production strongly depends on the number of OH bonds, standard oxidation potential, and polarity. Thus, the polarity of the alcohol used can affect the dissociative adsorption on the photocatalyst surface which enhances the H2 evolution. Y. Li et al. correlated the ratio of carbon atoms to hydroxyl groups present in ethylene glycol, methanol, glycerol, and anhydrous ethanol to their corresponding H2 production activity. The ratio was found to be two for anhydrous ethanol and one for ethylene glycol, methanol, and glycerol. The anhydrous ethanol exhibited the lowest and methanol the highest H2 production activity [209a], [b] [c]. In metal oxides, ethanol prefers to adsorb on the oxide due to the higher heat of adsorption of the oxides [210]. Computational studies have shown that on TiO2 surface, ethoxides are predominant compared to ethanol molecules and after interaction with protons, half of the ethoxides dehydrate to ethylene or dehydrogenate into acetaldehyde [211]. Carbon monoxide (CO) is one of the intermediate species for alcohols and oxidation of CO to CO2 is considered as one of the rates determining steps. For H2 production, the number of α-hydrogen and adsorption efficiency of the scavenger plays a key role, as the hydroxyl radical can extract the α-hydrogen and oxidize it to aldehyde, carbolic acid and, CO2 [191]. It has been reported in the Pd/TiO2 system that methanol forms a chemisorbed monolayer and methanol photoreforming occurs on the Pd vacant sites by adsorption and dehydrogenation process [210,212]. Methanol decomposes over the Pd catalysts and is oxidized to CO in dark at room temperature. However, due to CO poisoning of the surface, the reaction stops until exposed to the light. When exposed to light, the photogenerated oxidizing agents convert CO to CO2, therefore, cleaning the catalyst's surface. After CO2 desorption, anion vacancy is created in the metal oxide and the metal site becomes free. These vacant sites are then occupied by water molecules, which further produce more H2. The number of OH groups and length of the carbon chain facilitates the chemisorption and dictates the coordination efficiency of alcohols on the surface of photocatalysts. Compared to other alcohols, polyols and carbohydrates have been demonstrated to reacts quickly with holes in nanoseconds. On the other hand, carboxylic acid tends to adsorb on the surface of metal oxides such as TiO2 as carboxylate anions [213]. Griffin et al. observed that the decomposition of ethylene glycol on the Pd showed similar characteristics. Ethylene glycol was shown to adsorb on Pd surface via its oxygen atom by eliminating the α-hydroxyl hydrogen, resulting in the formation of ethylene dioxide [214]. In the case of saccharides such as glucose, sucrose, and fructose, the H2 production is lower than polyols, even though it has a high number of hydroxyl-functionalized carbon atoms. Kennedy et al. proposed that with saccharides, the reaction rate is dictated by the molecular mass of sugar due to the slow diffusion through the reaction solution [215]. The bulkier structures of sugar can also lead to less accessibility of active sites on the photocatalysts."
5,"Merits, limitations and future perspectives","Photocatalytic water splitting systems for the production of renewable hydrogen is an appealing solution to the universal energy crisis and environmental pollution. It is anticipated that a 2,50,000 km2 area and 10% STH conversion efficiency of a photocatalyst can provide one-third of the energy needs of the world [138]. Even though the photovoltaic (PV)-assisted photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells manifest high STH conversion efficiencies, these are expensive and complex to design on large scale. In comparison, on their flexibility and cost-effectiveness, particulate (suspension and immobilized) photocatalytic water splitting systems are projected to have superiority over PEC systems. The cost of hydrogen production by a single bed particle suspension based on photocatalyst powder slurry may reach the target choice of $1 to $3.5 kg per 10% STH efficiency [ [139,140]]. However, several issues act as a bottleneck in achieving a higher STH conversion efficiency. (1) To achieve an STH conversion efficiency of 10%, the photocatalysts should absorb the visible light of wavelength 600 nm with an AQE of 60% or above [15]. However, to drive the oxidation and reduction of water efficiently, minimum band gap energy greater than 2.0 eV is essential which restricts the performance of a photocatalyst. This condition leaves out most of the solar spectrum and restricts the overall realistically achievable STH performance to less than 10%. Consequently, technological advances such as up-conversion, multiple exciton generation (MEG), multi-strategy modifications, metal doping, formulating a heterojunction, and hot electron transfer are required to improve STH efficiency. MEG is a mechanism by which manifold electron-hole pairs or excitons are formed in the semiconductor nanocrystals upon absorption of a single high-energy photon. The up-conversion process in a photocatalyst is a challenging strategy as the appropriate choice of luminescent canters and suitable materials with minimal phonon energy, high chemical stability, and extraordinary tolerance are required. Thus an appropriate bandgap engineering to meet the necessities of a visible light-responsive catalyst will enhance the efficiency and thus strive towards reaching the required STH. (2) The other issue is the back reaction that decrease the efficiency of water splitting. The simultaneous release of H2 and O2 in a single-step photoexcitation system and extended molecular transport lengths in the two-step- photoexcitation leads to an uncertainty in the completion of water splitting. Fine-tuning of the material to enhance the charge carrier separation and migration can be attained by crystal structure modification, crystallinity improvement, surface passivation, nanostructure design, and heterojunction formation with semiconductors. (3) Furthermore, most of the studies on solar-driven water splitting are on the laboratory scale. A thorough exploration of the reactor design to scale up the photocatalysis is imperative to achieve the 10% STH. Along with designing a standard reactor, a global standard for comparison of the various catalysts at different environments can be of great significance to narrow down the potential photocatalysts [8d]. The impracticality of the typical photoreactor encompassing the particulate photocatalyst stirred in the water suspension is to be studied in detail concerning the additional energy input during stirring. Thus, a sheet-like system wherein the photocatalyst is fixed on solid plates can be promising in the exchange of catalytic materials. It is noteworthy that the progression to sheet-like photocatalyst upsurges the water decomposition activity in neutral pH water (pH = 7) which is otherwise in the case of conventional two-step particulate photocatalytic system which depends on the pH of the suspension."
6,Conclusion,"Over the past few decades, a large number of photocatalysts have been employed and notable achievements have been reported in the particulate photocatalytic water splitting system. The current study has addressed the significant progress made and highlighted the major challenges associated with the particulate photocatalytic water splitting system. Overcoming the major limitations such as lack of suitable visible light response photocatalysts and efficient charge carrier separation can drastically enhance the efficiency of the photocatalytic system. Maximizing the solar light absorption range of a photocatalyst from 500 nm to 1000 nm can potentially raise the STH efficiency to 25% and higher. Thus, a catalyst capable of capturing light up to 650 nm will be an appropriate candidate for water splitting. The quick transportation of photo-induced charge carriers to the surface reaction sites and inhibition of back reaction is desired to obtain effectual photocatalytic efficiency while avoiding recombination or trapping of these charge carriers."
