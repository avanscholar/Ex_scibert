0,Introduction,"Higher alcohols (C8–C22) are important materials used for the production of a plasticizer or detergent. One of the major manufacturing routes to produce these alcohols is to hydroformylate accessible and cheap higher olefins to aldehydes, which were further hydrogenated [1], as shown in Scheme 1 . It is known that rhodium–phosphine complex catalysts are widely used for the hydroformylation of propene to produce n-butanal, but are generally less suitable for the hydroformylation of normal internal higher olefins in the detergent area. Because of Rh catalyst's low double bond isomerization activity, the hydroformylation of internal olefins is a relatively slow process and shows low regioselectivity for the linear products. So far, the Shell cobalt–phosphine catalyst system is the preferred option to produce linear higher alcohols from normal internal higher olefins [2–4]. The primary advantage of cobalt catalysts over rhodium catalysts is their good reactivity toward internal olefins. The main problem in the Shell process is the difficult separation of homogeneous cobalt catalysts from the product (because of the high boiling point) after the reaction [5]. Another problem is the formation of alkyl formate by-products under the reaction condition, which have to be hydrolyzed after the reaction. So it is very significant to develop heterogeneous catalytic systems for the convenient recovery of the cobalt catalyst. An efficient aqueous/organic biphasic cobalt catalytic system is of special importance for catalyst recycling in the hydroformylation of higher olefins. Also the formation of alkyl formate in the aqueous biphasic media will be cut off theoretically since a large amount of water will lead to an easy ester hydrolysis reaction. Till now the aqueous/organic biphasic catalytic systems based on cobalt [6–10] have been relatively less studied in comparison with those based on rhodium. Very few studies have been presented in publications [6,7] which addressed cobalt catalyst recycling for the hydroformylation of internal olefins. Thermoregulated phase-transfer catalysis [11,12] (TRPTC) has been successfully applied in the rhodium-catalyzed hydroformylation of higher olefins in an aqueous/organic biphasic system. In our previous work, a kind of thermoregulated phase-transfer cobalt catalyst has been applied for the hydroformylation of 1-octene [13] in the aqueous/organic biphasic system. In this paper, further research on the production of higher alcohols from internal olefins is presented."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Normal C11–12 internal olefins were obtained from Fushun Petrochemical Company of CNPC. Other chemicals were purchased and used without prior purification. The polyethylene glycol tailed phosphine ligands L1 [Ph2P(CH2CH2O) n CH3] and L2 [ n BuPhP(CH2CH2O) n CH3] (Ph=phenyl, n Bu= n-butyl and n≈16) were prepared by a known method [14,15]. The cloud point of L1 was 77°C and that of L2 was 76°C (1% aqueous solution)."
3,Catalytic reaction,"2.2 Catalytic reaction A mixture of the polyethylene glycol tailed phosphine ligand, Co2(CO)8, C11–12 olefins, n-decane (as internal standard) and water was added into a 75mL stainless-steel autoclave. Then the autoclave was charged with 4.0MPa (initial pressure) of syngas (p H2/p CO =2) and immersed in a thermostatic oil bath with magnetic stirring. Under the reaction condition, a thermoregulated phase-transfer cobalt catalyst can form in situ from the phosphine ligand and cobalt carbonyl, and catalyze the reaction. After a fixed reaction time, the reactor was cooled to room temperature and depressurized. The reaction mixture was separated into two phases, the upper organic layer and the red brown aqueous layer containing the cobalt catalyst. The aqueous catalyst phase was isolated by phase separation from the reaction mixture and reused directly in the catalyst-recycling test by adding fresh C11–12 olefins and n-decane. The organic layer was analyzed quantitatively by gas chromatography (Techcomp 7890GC with 50m×0.25mm OV-101 column, column temperature program: 140°C (hold 16min), 220°C (10°C/min) and 220°C (hold 10min), and FID detector). The yield of alcohols (Yol) was the molar percentage of alcohols obtained to the C11–12 olefins added, and so the yield of aldehydes plus alcohols (Yal+ol). The selectivity Sol (or Sal) of alcohols (or aldehydes) was the molar percentage of alcohols (or aldehydes) to the sum of alcohols and aldehydes in the reaction mixture. The linearity of alcohols was the molar ratio of the linear alcohols to the sum of alcohols."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Hydroformylation reaction,"3.1 Hydroformylation reaction Two types of thermoregulated phase-transfer cobalt catalysts (L1–Co and L2–Co), were formed in situ from the phosphine ligand L1 and L2, respectively, and their catalytic results in the conversion of C11–12 olefins into alcohols under different reaction conditions were summarized in Table 1 . It can be seen that the reaction temperature had an obvious effect on the alcohol yield and selectivity. At 140°C, only a small amount of aldehydes formed and no alcohol was found (entries 1–2 and 10–11). With an increase of reaction temperature from 140°C to 180°C, the yield and the selectivity of alcohols increased for both catalysts. The highest alcohol yield was achieved at 180°C. These results were similar to the research work of others [6,7]. The catalyst performances were influenced by the molar ratio of the phosphine ligand to cobalt (L/Co) in the range from 1:1 to 4:1. At a reaction temperature of 160°C, as the L/Co molar ratio increased, the linearity of alcohols increased obviously for both L1–Co and L2–Co catalysts. At a reaction temperature of 180°C with the increase of the L/Co molar ratio, the linearity of alcohols was nearly the same with L1–Co as the catalyst, but it increased slightly with L2–Co as the catalyst. The difference of basicity of these two phosphine ligands is the main reason for this phenomenon. It was known that under the reaction condition, the given equilibrium existed, HCo(CO)3L+CO⇌HCo(CO)4 +L. Both HCo(CO)3L and HCo(CO)4 are active for the hydroformylation of olefin, and HCo(CO)4 is more active but leads to low selectivity to a linear product [4]. Phosphine coordinated hydrocobaltcarbonyl HCo(CO)3L had a higher selectivity for a linear product than HCo(CO)4. Under the same reaction temperature with the same L/Co ratio, a ligand L2 modified cobalt catalyst gave alcohol products with higher linearity. This may come from the following reasons, (i) ligand L2 with stronger basicity made the coordination equilibrium more on the left side and a more phosphine coordinated cobalt catalyst gave rise to more linear alcohols, and (ii) an electron-rich phosphine ligand favored the isomerization of an internal double bond to generate the terminal olefins, which were necessary for the formation of linear alcohols in the hydroformylation process [16,17]. The yield of alcohols in the reaction system is related to the activity and stability of the cobalt catalyst. For the two ligands with different basicity to stabilize the cobalt catalyst in the above mentioned coordination equilibrium, their optimal L/Co ratios should be different. Because HCo(CO)4 is prone to decompose at high temperature, due to a L1–Co catalyst with a weaker basic ligand L1, the yield of alcohols was low when the L/Co ratio was 1:1 and an optimal yield of alcohols was observed with a L/Co ratio of 2:1. Under the optimized reaction condition with a catalyst composition of L1–Co and L2–Co (L/Co=2:1, entry 9 and 18), the yield of alcohols reached 84% and 86%, and correspondingly the catalyst turn-over frequency (TOF=(mol alcohol)/(mol cobalt×time)) reached 2.1h−1 and 2.2h−1, respectively. These results indicated that in this aqueous/organic biphasic catalytic system for the hydroformylation of very hydrophobic substrate C11–12 internal olefins, the water soluble cobalt catalysts had similar activities in comparison with that of cobalt catalysts modified by typical lipophilic phosphine ligands, such as Phoban derivatives, patented by the Shell Oil Company [2], (Yol 77–85%, TOF=1.8–2.4h−1) or n-Bu3P (Yol 77%, TOF=0.6h−1) in the homogeneous hydroformylation of normal internal decenes [3]. The thermoregulated phase-transfer cobalt catalyst in an aqueous/organic biphasic system is promising for the production of linear higher alcohols from C11–12 internal olefins. The reaction rate was not limited by the poor solubility of the higher olefins in water. That was attributed to the special feature of the TRPTC system, i.e. at high temperature the catalyst modified by polyethylene glycol tailed phosphine would transfer into the organic phase due to its inverse water solubility and a homogeneously catalytic reaction proceeded [13]. In addition, no alkyl formate by-product was detected in this aqueous/organic biphasic catalytic system."
6,Catalyst-recycling test,"3.2 Catalyst-recycling test A prerequisite for the technical use of aqueous biphasic cobalt catalysts is the simple separation of the cobalt catalyst and the product, and the efficient reuse of the catalyst. In this thermoregulated phase-transfer cobalt catalytic aqueous/organic biphasic system, after reaction on cooling to room temperature, the catalysts would recover their water solubility and return into aqueous phase. So the catalytic process takes place in a style of monophasic reaction combined with a biphasic separation. The recycling of the cobalt catalyst was tested up to 4 times under the optimized reaction conditions (T =180°C, L/Co=2:1, P =4.0MPa, t =15h), and the leaching of cobalt into the organic phase was detected by ICP-AES. The recycling test results were summarized in Table 2 . It can be seen that in every successive recycling reaction, for L1–Co catalyst, the yield of alcohols decreased from 80% (1st run) to 67% (4th run) and the leaching of cobalt into the organic phase was 0.9%–2.7% of the total cobalt initially added, but for L2–Co catalyst, the yield of alcohols decreased from 80% (1st run) to 72% and the leaching of cobalt into the organic phase was 0.8%–1.7%. It could be concluded that the L2–Co catalyst could keep better catalyst activity and lower leaching of cobalt on a recycling test. The good reusability of the L2–Co catalyst might be due to the stronger basicity of ligand L2 and hence better coordination ability, which enabled more cobalt to be complexed. So at high temperature the L2–Co catalyst is more stable than the L1–Co catalyst and at room temperature L2–Co returns to the aqueous phase leading to less leaching in the organic phase. The leaching of phosphorus into the organic phase was also measured in every recycling reaction. It was found that no more than 1% of P element initially added could be detected in the organic phase each time. From the comparison of the catalyst activity and the loss of cobalt each time, it could be deduced that there was catalyst deactivation during the reaction. Decomposition of cobalt catalyst by some way may take place during a high temperature reaction. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that after 4 times of recycling, the TON (turn-over number, TON=(mol alcohol)/(mol cobalt)) of L1–Co and L2–Co catalysts reached 147 and 154, respectively, which were superior to the Shell's homogeneous cobalt catalysts (TON=68–85) in the hydroformylation of C10–C14 internal olefins [2,3]. Furthermore the TON of the thermoregulated phase-transfer cobalt catalyst would increase through more recycling times. Further works on improving the stability and reusability of this thermoregulated phase-transfer cobalt catalyst are ongoing."
7,Conclusion,"The thermoregulated phase-transfer cobalt catalyst has been applied for the first time to the production of linear higher alcohols from normal C11–12 internal olefins via hydroformylation and hydrogenation in the aqueous/organic biphasic system. Good catalyst activity and high linear product selectivity have been obtained. Easy catalyst recovery can be realized by phase separation, and the aqueous phase containing the cobalt catalyst has been reused directly in successive recycling reaction for 4 times. The catalyst's TON was around 150, better than the homogeneous cobalt catalysts' TON (68–85)."
