0,Introduction,"MCM-41, a kind of aluminosilicate crystal with regular channel and cage structure, consists of basic structural units tetrahedral SiO or AlO connecting by common oxygen bridge [1]. The MCM-41 with long-distance ordered arrangement of hexagonal structure is a vital member of the M41S family [2,3]. The MCM-41 is widely used in various fields, including energy, environmental protection, aerospace, ionic exchange, separation by adsorption and catalysis [4–6]. MCM-41 is particularly prominent because of the great specific surface area (1000 m2·g−1), uniform pore size and simple composition [4,7]. It has shown well prospect of application in heterogeneous catalytic reactions, which has aroused great interest of researchers worldwide [8,9]. However, it is a problem that MCM-41 with pure silicon has few active sites. Metal-loaded modification is the common method for the MCM-41 with heteroatoms, and the size and dispersion of metal particles are important factors affecting the catalytic performance [10] [11]. With the decrease of the size of metal particles, the more unsaturated ligating atoms on surface results can improve the catalytic activity of catalyst [12–16]. But on the other hand, the metal particles will agglomerate easily [17]. Therefore, it is difficult to balance the dispersion of mental species with the catalytic activity. The modification of MCM-41 with heteroatoms doping into the framework can avoid above problems availably. A. Corma, et al. [18] prepared the Ti-MCM-41 in 1994, and the material gave rise to useful catalysts for the oxidation of some organic compounds. N. Ulagappan and C. N. R. Rao synthesized the Cr-MCM-41 with redox catalytic properties in 1996 [19]. Highly ordered Ni-MCM-41 samples were prepared by Y. Yang, et al. [20]. K. Wu, et al. [21] synthetized V-MCM-41 with high content of vanadium in the framework. Moreover, the V-MCM-41 showed excellent catalytic performance for the oxidation of cyclohexane. The above indicated that the modified MCM-41 with transition metals (TM) in framework could be synthetized successfully. Besides, the samples exhibited the well activity for the different catalytic reactions, which indicated the doping of transition metals effectively increased the active sites of pure silicon MCM-41. The Pd@Cu(II)-MOF was synthetized by G. Chen, et al. [17] showing excellent catalytic activity for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol and selectivity for benzaldehyde. Therefore, the oxidation of benzyl alcohol provides the possibility for the preparation of benzaldehyde with porous materials [22]. The MCM-41 as an important porous material has the advantages of simple synthesis, low cost, good thermal stability and chemical stability of framework compared with MOF, and it can be widely used in industrial catalysis in the future [18]. The benzaldehyde, an indispensable organic chemical material, could be used for the production of lauraldehyde, lauric acid, phenylacetaldehyde and benzyl benzoate [23]. It is also an important intermediate for dyes, spices and pharmaceuticals [24–27]. In traditional production, chlorobenzene is produced by chlorination of toluene and then hydrolyzed to benzaldehyde. Organochlorine or benzoic acid will be introduced in the process inevitably, and their existence seriously limits the application of benzaldehyde in perfume and other industries [28–30]. The common oxidation products of primary alcohols are corresponding aldehydes and carboxylic acids. The aromatic primary alcohol with simplest configuration, benzyl alcohol, can be oxidized to benzaldehyde and anisole [26,31–34]. Therefore, the aldehydes should be removed quickly from the system to prevent further oxidation in the process of preparation of aldehydes by oxidation of primary alcohols [35]. The oxidation of benzyl alcohol for benzaldehyde still needs the catalysts with better performance. In general, the study of synthesis and catalytic performance of TM-MCM-41 is still very valuable. MCM-41 is usually synthetized under alkaline conditions. Because precipitation of vanadium species is not easy to form under the condition and the variable valence state of vanadium, the vanadium is chosen as heteroatom to increase the active sites of MCM-41. In contribution, the highly ordered V-MCM-41 with high content vanadium was prepared in the system by controlling the amount of weak base, showing good catalytic performance for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. In addition, we found that the weak base is more suitable for the crystallization of MCM-41 than the strong base (NaOH) in this paper. The paper provides the possibility for the synthesis and industrial application of highly ordered V-MCM-41 with well-dispersed vanadium."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All the chemicals with analytical grade were used without any further purification. The chemicals were ethyl silicate (TEOS), ammonium hydroxide (NH3·H2O, 25 wt% Aldrich), vanadium sulfate (VOSO4), hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (C19H42BrN, CTAB), benzyl alcohol (C7H8O), benzaldehyde (C6H5CHO), benzoic acid (C6H5COOH), acetonitrile (C2H3N), chlorobenzene (C6H5Cl), H2O2 (30%) and deionized water."
3,Synthesis,"2.2 Synthesis The synthesis of V-MCM-41 was based on a previous paper with revision [36]. The specific synthetic steps were as follows, 0.30 g hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) was dissolved in 11.20 g deionized water then stirred for 1 h. A certain amount of ammonium hydroxide (NH3·H2O) was added to the CTAB solution and stirred for another 1 h in the closed system to prevent the volatilization of NH3·H2O. Meanwhile, different qualities of vanadium sulfate (VOSO4) were dissolved in 3.80 g deionized water until uniform dissolution was completed. Then VOSO4 solution slowly dropped into the above mixture with strong agitation. 1.67 g ethyl silicate (TEOS) was dripped very slowly to ensure the sufficient hydrolysis. After stirring for 2 h, the mixture was transferred into a steel autoclave for hydrothermal treatment. The product was filtrated and washed with hot deionized water of 343 K until neutral condition and dried at 353 K for 12 h. The V-MCM-41 was calcined in air atmosphere with temperature-programmed route to remove the structure-directing agent (2 K·min−1 to 773 K for 4 h). The final product was noted xV-MCM-41 (x was the ratio of n V/n Si in the system). To study the optimal conditions of MCM-41, various conditions were introduced to synthesize MCM-41, and the detailed experiments were listed in Tables S1, S2 and S3 (Supporting Information). To study the effect of different kinds of bases on final products, the NaOH solution (1 mol⋅L–1) and NH3·H2O (25 wt%) were used to regulate the alkalinity of the reaction system. The detailed experiments are listed in Tables S4 and S5 (Supplementary Material). To study the applicability of the synthetic method of V-MCM-41 above, the preparation of MCM-41 modified by the other transition metals were carried out, including Mn, Ni, Zn, Cu, Co, Cd, Fe and Cr. The mole ratio of each metal to silicon was 0.05, and other synthetic conditions were the same as the V-MCM-41."
4,Material characterization,"2.3 Material characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was used to obtain the information about the composition and structure of materials at 40 kV and 40 mA with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation. The composition of materials and the oxidation state of V were identified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) that was performed on ESCALAB250Xi. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was collected at 77 K which detected the unpaired electrons in atoms or molecules to explore the structural characteristics. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) pattern was measured by the method of KBr pellet recording the data from 400 to 4000 cm−1. Raman spectrum was obtained using a Thermo Scientific spectrometer, with a 532 nm excitation line. Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis) of the materials was collected on a JapaneseJasco (UV-550) scanning spectrophotometer and the integrated sphere was used. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, PerkinElmer Optima 2000DV ICP-OES) was used to determine metal content. Surface area of material was determined by Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) method using Micromeritics ASAP-2020 and the materials were degassed at 473 K for 12 h before the test. The morphology and dimensions of the material that was gold-sputtered were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, NOVA NanoSEM 450, FEI). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) was attached to the scanning electron microscope. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurement was carried out using ChemBET Pulsar TPR/TPD equipment to analyze the reducibility of materials. The material was placed in a quartz tube reactor in the interior of a controlled oven before reduction. The material was flushed with high purity argon at 573 K for 1 h in order to remove water and other contaminants. A gas mixture, 5 vol% H2 in Ar, passed through the material continuously."
5,Catalytic test,"2.4 Catalytic test The reaction, oxidation of benzyl alcohol, was carried out to test the catalytic performance of V-MCM-41. Acetonitrile (5 ml) as the solvent and 2 ml 30% H2O2 as oxidant were added in a round-bottom flask equipped with a condenser. Besides, 1.00 g of benzyl alcohol and 0.10 g of V-MCM-41 were mixed, and then were stirred at 343 K for 10 h. The mixture was filtered by a sand core funnel. Chlorobenzene as the internal standard, the liquid was analyzed by GC-7890F equipped with a FID detector and a SE-54 column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). The main products were benzaldehyde and benzoic acid (Scheme 1 )."
6,Results and Discussions,
7,The weak base in favor of the synthesis of V-MCM-41,"3.1 The weak base in favor of the synthesis of V-MCM-41 In order to determine the optimal synthesis conditions of MCM-41, several factors including the reaction temperature, reaction time and alkalinity were considered. Fig. S1a and Table S1 (Supplementary Material) showed the XRD patterns of all silica MCM-41 synthesized at different temperatures ranging from 333 K to 463 K for 72 h. With the increase of reaction temperature, the intensity of the diffraction peaks of the synthesized MCM-41 enhanced until 393 K, while the XRD intensity declined above 393 K or even disappeared at 463 K. Fig. S1b and Table S2 (Supplementary Material) showed the XRD patterns of the samples obtained by different reaction time at 393 K, suggesting that the additional time had little effect on the XRD intensity of MCM-41. As for different amounts of ammonia in reaction system (Fig. S2 and Table S3), the XRD intensity and peak locations of MCM-41 were shifted. The quantity of ammonia with 7.12 g NH3·H2O was beneficial to the synthesis of MCM-41 with pretty crystallization. Therefore, the optimal conditions for the synthesis of MCM-41 were determined as 7.12 g NH3·H2O at 393 K for 12 h. V-MCM-41 with different amounts of vanadium was synthetized based on the above results (Table S4 and S5). Fig. 1 (1°–5°) showed the XRD patterns of V-MCM-41, and the x of xV-MCM-41 was the initial molar ratio of vanadium to silicon (V/Si). The XRD result with different bases in NaOH (Table S5) and NH3·H2O (Table S4) was showed in Fig.1a and b. The V-MCM-41 in NaOH and NH3·H2O systems could be synthesized successfully, and both of the maximum addition of vanadium reached 0.25 (V/Si). However, there were a few differences in the diffraction peaks, as clearly depicted in Fig. 1c. The peaks of samples in NH3·H2O system had the stronger intensity and narrower full width at half maxima than those in the NaOH system, indicating that the weak base was beneficial to the generation of highly ordered hexagonal mesoporous structure. Because of the large amount of VOSO4, the overfull OH− was necessary. Molecular sieves were synthesized in the basic medium in which OH− assisted in the crystallization process of silicate species, including the polymerization, depolymerization and repolymerization [37–39]. Nevertheless, the silicate radicals would hydrolyzed fleetly because NaOH in the system produced large amount of OH− instantly, leading to the produce of abundant SiO bond. Meanwhile, the continuing increase of NaOH to excess led to the dissolution of silicate species. It was difficult for SiO bond to hydrolyze and reorganize ordered structure around the structure-directing agent. The slow hydrolysis of excessive weak base, producing the continuous and small amount of OH−, was more conducive to the depolymerization and repolymerization of silicate species and heteroatom species. Also, it was a sufficient time for silicate species to grow into highly ordered structures, and the heteroatom species could fully mix with silicon species to build the SiOV framework. On the other hand, the NH3·H2O and transition metal ions may form complexes to avoid precipitation and facilitate the dispersion of transition metal species to form the framework structure. Overall, the weak base was more suitable for synthesis of high ordered V-MCM-41 with well-dispersed vanadium. The intensity of all diffraction peaks was weakened with the addition of vanadium in the system of NH3·H2O (Fig. 1b). There was more and more vanadium oxide accumulated out of the framework causing the obstruction of channels, and the heteroatoms species hindered the process of mineralization of MCM-41 [40]. Besides, the crystal surface spacing of (100) in Table 1 , d110, was enlarged with the introduction of increasing vanadium (V/Si < 0.10). When V/Si > 0.10, the value of d110 decreased with the increase of vanadium atoms in framework. The possible reason for the above results may be that the larger vanadium atoms replaced the smaller silicon atoms leading to the expansion of pores and the increase of d110, which could be proved by the phenomenon that the diffraction peak of (100) was shifted to a smaller angle [41]. When the vanadium increases to a certain extent (V/Si > 0.10), the vanadium species in the channel resulted in the decrease of pore diameter and interplanar spacing of (110). Fig. 1d shows the XRD pattern of V-MCM-41 within the range of wide angle. The peaks of (210) showed the same change as the other peaks. There were no any peaks attributed to the vanadium species, and only the wide peak belonged to amorphous silica, which illustrated the well dispersion of vanadium species. The XRD pattern confirmed the successful synthesis of MCM-41 with different metals in Fig. 2 . The V-MCM-41 presented the best diffraction peaks with the strongest intensity and the narrowest width, confirming the best degree of order of V-MCM-41. The vanadium species did not precipitate under alkaline conditions, while the other transition metal ions were easy to precipitate under the condition. The results of EDS identified the existence of each transition metal in Fig. S3. Therefore, the synthesis method of V-MCM-41 was also applicable for the preparation of MCM-41 modified by the other transition metals. The influence of vanadium doping on the morphology of V-MCM-41 was further studied by FE-SEM (Fig. S4 and Fig. 3 ) to observe the changes of morphology with the augment of vanadic content. All samples presented the irregular block within 1–2 μm grain size. When V/Si ≤ 0.10, there were few fine particles on the surface and the blocks were clean. When the content of vanadium continued increasing, many particles accumulated on the surface and the morphologies became more amorphous. In view of what was aforementioned, the most reasonable explanation was that the excessive vanadium impeded the mineralization of silicate and vanadium species [42]. In other words, the addition of VOSO4 affected the polymerization, depolymerization and repolymerization of SiOSi bond [43]. Consequently, when the amount of doping vanadium increased to a certain extent, the vanadium species and silicate stacked on the surface of samples and affected the crystallization. Correspondingly, the intensity of XRD peaks weakened and the full width at half maxima broadened, as supported by XRD patterns (Fig. 1b). The FE-SEM images of V-MCM-41 in the system of NaOH solution are showed in Fig. 4 . The sizes of MCM-41 and V-MCM-41 synthesized in NaOH system were larger than those synthesized in the NH3·H2O system, and the sample blocks all piled together. Besides, there was so much debris around the samples that they look particularly messy, indicating that the crystallization and growth of molecular sieve were not complete. By comparing the morphology of samples synthesized in different systems, it presented that the MCM-41 and V-MCM-41 in NH3·H2O system had the more orderly and regular shape. The above proved the NH3·H2O to be more conducive to the formation and growth of highly ordered structure of MCM-41 again. It was consistent with XRD results."
8,Characterization of V-MCM-41,"3.2 Characterization of V-MCM-41 To reveal the well-dispersed vanadium in the framework of MCM-41, various techniques (IR, Raman, UV–Vis, EDS, XPS, ICP-AES, EPR and TPR) are to be used. Fig. 5a showed the IR spectra of MCM-41 and V-MCM-41. The peak at 478 cm−1 was attributed to the SiO stretching vibration [44]. The peaks at 798 cm−1 and 1085 cm−1 corresponded to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibration of the framework tetrahedral SiO [45]. The vibration of SiOSi at 1240 cm−1 was the characteristic group of MCM-41. The intensity of bands at 3460 cm−1, 1640 cm−1 and 970 cm−1 assigned to the surface SiOH and H2O decreased with the increase of vanadic content. The possible reason was that the vanadium replaced the framework silicon resulting in the reduction of OH group [36], as illustrated by Fig. 5b [46]. This result was supported by the decrease of the wall thickness of samples listed in Table 1. And the peak around 820 cm−1 due to the vibration of VOV group did not appear [47], which indicated that there was little vanadium species or the vanadium species well dispersed in the channels and on the surface of V-MCM-41 [48]. In order to further determine the vanadium state in V-MCM-41, Raman spectrum was exhibited in Fig. 5c. The typical peaks of VOV appeared when the doping amount is up to 0.10 (V/Si) [3]. Besides, the intensity became stronger when the initial ratio of vanadium to silicon was 0.25. Therefore, not all the vanadium was in the framework of MCM-41 and the other vanadium species out of framework dispersed well. For confirming the environment of vanadium in V-MCM-41, the UV–Vis spectra were depicted in Fig. 5d. The spectra of V-MCM-41 with different vanadic content were divided into three parts. The first band around 220 nm belonged to the framework of silicon based materials [44]. The other two absorption bands ranged from 250 nm to 400 nm and 400 nm to 600 nm. The former was caused by the charge transfer transition of framework O2− → Vn+, and absorption strength of the band was enhanced with the increase of vanadium doping amount [49]. The result could prove that the vanadium replaced the silicon in tetrahedral coordination environment successfully [40]. The latter, narrow and weak absorption band, ascribed to the d–d transition of vanadium species, which illustrated the existence of extra-framework vanadium species even in the 0.005 V-MCM-41 with a small amount of vanadium [44]. In summary, most vanadium got into the framework while the others dispersed well outside the framework. It was in accord with the results of the XRD, IR and Raman. In Fig. S3a, the main elements of 0.05 V-MCM-41, Si, O and V, were detected by EDS, which were consistent with the result of the XPS (Fig. 6a, 0.10V-MCM-41). The contents of vanadium in all samples were 0.15 wt%, 0.25 wt%, 0.89 wt%, 1.41 wt%, 2.42 wt%, 4.05 wt%, 4.94 wt% and 5.17 wt% as confirmed by ICP-AES, which is listed in Table 1. The binding energy (BE) of Si2p spectrogram (Fig. 6b) was located in 103.7 eV that attributed to the framework silicon of OSiO in MCM-41 [50]. The spectrum of O1s (Fig. 6c) was fitted into four peaks, and the binding energies of peaks were 530.7 eV, 533 eV, 533.5 eV and 534 eV, which originated from the VO/VO x , SiOSi, SiOV and SiOH respectively [51–54]. The BE of SiOV was larger than vanadium oxide and framework SiOSi, which could be illustrated that V substituted Si of chain-silicates changing the electron density of framework. There were three bands of V2p3/2 spectrum (Fig. 6d) at 516.4 eV, 517.3 eV and 518.4 eV vesting in SiOV (IV), VO x and SiOV (V) [55–59]. The above results suggested that most of the vanadium existed in the framework with tetravalent and pentavalent states and the rest of vanadium species were outside the framework. The valence states of vanadium were further affirmed by EPR and TPR. Fig. 7a exhibited the EPR spectra of representative samples, 0.005V-MCM-41, 0.10V-MCM-41 and 0.25V-MCM-41. Because of the less amount of vanadium or the existence of pentavalent vanadium in 0.005V-MCM-41, no signal peak appeared (V5+ with the electron state of 3d0) [40]. While the others, 0.10V-MCM-41 and 0.25V-MCM-41, had the responsive peaks with 8-fold hyperfine splitting that was caused by V4+ in the quadridentate environment (g‖ ≈ 1.97, A‖ ≈ 179 G or 17.9 mT and g┴ ≈ 1.98, A┴ ≈ 65 G or 6.5 mT) [60,61]. The phenomenon was incurred by the interaction of free electrons of V (IV, 3d1) with the magnetic nuclear moment of 51V (I = 7/2) [62,63]. The stronger intensity testified the more vanadium with quadrivalent status in the framework. Otherwise, the vanadium would be oxidized to pentavalence easily in the process of removing the template by calcination (873 K for 4 h). Furthermore, the conclusion of TPR was in agreement with the above-mentioned (Fig. 7b). The reduction peaks of samples appeared in the range of 700 K–1100 K. The first stage <800 K belonged to the reduction of vanadium (V) species out of the framework. The main peaks lied in 800 K– 900 K, which owed to the vanadium (V) with tetrahedral coordination [64]. The reduction temperature of pentavalent vanadium in the framework was higher than that out of the framework, indicating the strong interaction of vanadium in framework with OSiO chains of V-MCM-41. The last one that is higher than 900 K was vested in the further reduction of vanadium (IV) [65]. Moreover, the reduction temperature of samples went up with the increase of vanadic content, which indicated the increase of vanadium in the framework [66]. The result proved the existence of pentavalent vanadium in framework. Above all, the valence state of vanadium was further identified, existing in V and IV states. The pore structure and properties were characterized by TEM (Fig. 8 ) and nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. 9 ). By comparing the TEM images, the images of 0.005 V-MCM-41 could find the neat edge, the two-dimensional hexagonal mesoporous and well-ordered pore arrangements. The textural characteristic of 0.10V-MCM-41 was not clear as 0.005V-MCM-41 but remained a complete structure, which verified the good dispersion of vanadium species and the result of SEM again. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of some samples are showed in Fig. 9a. The isotherms were typical type-IV, which signified the mesoporous structure of MCM-41 with different vanadic contents [67]. The hysteresis loops of type H4 implied the slit-like mesoporous with uniform shape and size, which also affirmed the well dispersion of vanadium species [67]. The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of V-MCM-41 showed two hysteresis loops at both relative pressure ranges of 0.2–0.4 and 0.4–0.8, while the MCM-41 had only one hysteresis loop range of 0.4–0.8. Because of the vanadium species on the surface of V-MCM-41, the irreversible chemical adsorption was enhanced, resulting in the appearance of tiny hysteresis loop range of 0.2–0.4. The D p of the MCM-41, 0.005V-MCM, 0.10V-MCM-41 and 0.25V-MCM-41 were 3.05 nm, 3.08 nm, 3.08 nm and 3.07 nm (Fig. 9b), and the specific surface area were 980 m2·g−1, 891 m2·g−1, 843 m2·g−1, and 424 m2·g−1, respectively. With the increase of vanadium content, the D p of V-MCM-41 were enlarged because of the replacement of smaller atomic radius silicon (0.117 nm) by vanadium (0.135 nm), and the S BET reduced owing to the introduction of vanadium and the existence of vanadium species out of framework. However, the abnormal date about the S BET of 0.25V-MCM-41 declined sharply. The excessive addition of vanadium led to the destruction of structure and accumulation of large amounts of vanadium species out of the framework, affecting the original structure and properties of MCM-41 seriously (the same as FE-SEM)."
9,Catalytic performance of V-MCM-41,"3.3 Catalytic performance of V-MCM-41 A. L. Cánepa, et al. tested the catalytic performances of V-MCM-41, Fe-MCM-41 and Co-MCM-41 for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol [9]. The V-MCM-41 had better catalytic performance than Fe-MCM-41 and Co-MCM-41, showing high TON (1100 mol·mol−1·V−1), selectivity to benzaldehyde (95%) and 31.7% yield [9]. Hence, we chose the oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol to evaluate the catalytic performances of the materials. Comparison of catalytic effects of MCM-41 was modified by different transition metals with the same doping ratio (Fig. 10b); the 0.05 V-MCM-51 showed the best performance about the conversion (71.33%) of benzyl alcohol. The possible reason was the most variable valence state of vanadium or the minimum inhibition for the crystallization of MCM-41. The 0.05Cu-MCM-41 and 0.05Zn-MCM-41 had the best selectivity for benzaldehyde. For the V-MCM-41 with different vanadic contents (Fig. 10a), the conversion of benzyl alcohol became better with the increase of vanadium when V/Si ≤ 0.10. Meanwhile, the conversion decreased with increasing vanadic content (V/Si > 0.10). Thus, 0.10V-MCM-41 was the optimal catalyst for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol, the conversion of benzyl alcohol up to 74.83%, selectivity for benzaldehyde up to 96.20% and the yield for benzaldehyde up to 71%. The yield of benzaldehyde in other catalytic reaction in this paper was also favorable (Fig. S5). The oxidation mechanism of benzyl alcohol with V-MCM-41 is listed in Scheme 2 [44,45]. The main active species during the catalytic process was probably the transition metals in the framework of MCM-41. The reactant molecules could be activated by vanadium in the framework and to be oxidized more easily. The vanadium in the framework of MCM-41 could combine with hydrogen peroxide in some ways, touching with the substrate. Thanks to the large specific surface area and special pore structure of MCM-41, the special sites of vanadium in framework of MCM-41 were beneficial to the oxidation of benzyl alcohol, providing the special reaction place (on the surface or in channel) [8,68]. The more vanadium atoms in the framework, the more active sites in the catalyst, the lower the activation energy of the reaction and the more benzyl alcohol molecules to be oxidized easier over the same period. Vanadium species accumulated outside the framework would affect the activity of vanadium in framework. Therefore, the highly ordered 0.10V-MCM-41 with the most vanadium atoms in framework showed the best catalytic performance. Because of the different states of vanadium (pentavalent and tetravalent framework vanadium) in V-MCM-41, there were two routes about catalytic reaction of benzyl alcohol by V-MCM-41. In the oxidation of benzyl alcohol, the valence state of vanadium in MCM-41 framework determined the reaction pathways and products of the catalytic reaction. The vanadium in the framework with pentavalence was beneficial to the production of benzoic acid, while the vanadium with the state of tetravalence was propitious to the generation of benzaldehyde. Combining with the previous analytic results of V-MCM-41 that with different contents of vanadium, the most reasonable explanations were that the doping of vanadium could add the active sites of MCM-41 effectively and hardly disturbed the original ordered structure of MCM-41 at the same time (V/Si ≤ 0.10). The continued increase of vanadium destroyed the structure of MCM-41 seriously causing the accumulation of excess vanadium species, and led to a worse catalytic effect, instead. Comparing with the catalytic data in other literatures (list in Table 2 ), the catalytic performance of V-MCM-41 in this paper was better than the transition metals modified MCM-41 in others, but the effects were not as good as zeolite containing rare earth element and noble metal [28,46]. To study the morphology and structure changes of catalysts after catalytic test, the XRD pattern, SEM images and XPS analysis results were shown in Figs. S6–S8. There were few changes of 0.10V-MCM-41 after catalytic test, indicating the well structural stability of the prepared samples. The samples after catalytic test could be recycled and used for the catalytic reaction. Overall, the V-MCM-41 synthesized in this paper did have a better catalytic performance combining the economically affordable applicability with the simplicity of synthesis. The paper provided the possibility for large-scale production of benzaldehyde by oxidation of benzyl alcohol with V-MCM-41 in industry."
10,Conclusions,"The highly ordered V-MCM-41 with high vanadic content was synthetized under the excessive alkaline condition. Contrasting the effects of NH3·H2O and NaOH for the synthesis of V-MCM-41, the result indicated that NH3·H2O was more conducive to the synthesis of material with well-ordered hexagonal structure. The possible reason was that the slow hydrolysis of weak base was more beneficial to the mineralization of V-MCM-41 and the good dispersion of vanadium species in framework. Therefore, the paper provided the efficient synthesis method for highly ordered V-MCM-41 with well-dispersed vanadium species. The maximum initial ratio of vanadium to silicon reached 0.25. When V/Si = 0.10, the sample showed the best catalytic activity for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol comparing the catalytic results of V-MCM-41 with different vanadic contents. It provided the possibility for the application of V-MCM-41 in the industry including the oxidation of benzyl alcohol for the preparation of benzaldehyde. The catalytic result proved that the excessive doping would reduce the catalytic performance of materials. Besides, MCM-41 doped with other transition metals can be synthetized by the method in this paper successfully."
