0,Introduction,"Environmental deprivation and depletion of the stock of fossil fuels are the two major problems currently experienced by globally. Extraction of these fossil fuels and major consumption decreases the ground-based carbon sources. So, in the present context, the research for alternative fuels is justified, which will promise the overall development in the sustainable energy resources, environmental up-gradation and develop sustainable fuel life cycle. Bio-origin, i.e. plant-based and animal fat-based fuels are alternative fuels and can be used to address the global petroleum crises. The summary of world energy consumption of various energy sources is shown in Table 1. The role of biofuel in th primary fuel consumption has shown an increase in 2019 and is projected to follow similar trend in the coming 15 years. Biofuels with low carbon impression have appeared as a prospective nominee that can substitute fossil-based energy sources (Mandotra et al., 2018). It has taken over five decades to launch biofuels as a piece of the global energy portfolio. The use of biofuels was started in 1900 when Rudolf Diesel displayed an engine running fuelled with peanut oil at World Exhibition in Paris, trailed by Henry Ford in 1908, anticipated to run a motor fuelled with corn ethanol. The upheaval of vegetable oils as feedstock for diesel fuels started in 1940s, and its advancement took diverse ways in various nations being managed with various strategies (Ziolkowska, 2018). Due to the environmental and economic benefits of biofuels in contrast with petroleum products, they are rapidly progressing as elective alternates of sustainable sources (Sekoai et al., 2019; Shahir et al., 2015b). Afterwards, for the last several years, broad endeavours are being made looking for substitute energy to beat the reliance on petroleum derivatives and minimize ecological contaminations. In this respect, a few substitute fuels such as oxygenated fuels like ethanol, biodiesel, dimethyl ether, biogas, and hydrogen have been widely examined (Sekoai et al., 2019; EJ et al., 2017). Latest investigations demonstrate that biofuels are the best from the most anticipated substitute fuels for diesel in light of its sustainable, biodegradable, oxygenated, and sulphur free qualities (Tamilselvan et al., 2017). In 2016 around 4% of global transport fuels were provided from biofuels (corresponding to 8X107 TOE) liable for about 23% of overall CO2 releases (Oh et al., 2018; Matthews et al., 2016). For instance, European Union (EU) energy directives offer 10% for biofuels in the EU energy blend by 2020 (Flach et al., 2015), and the US sets an aggregate production objective of 36 billion gallons of biofuel by 2022 (EPA, 2007). Many governments of different countries are offers subsidies and waiving their tax on the production of biodiesel in order to establish the biodiesel industries. Cost of biodiesel is still comparable with the cost of other alternative fuels. Table 2 shows the overall average fuel prices across the world (Shahir et al., 2014). Utilizing straight biodiesel in diesel engine have favourable properties such as a decrease in most of the combustion discharges, biodegradability, inborn lubricity, and of renewable nature (Rodríguez-Couto, 2019), on the other hand, it has burdens such as higher density, lesser heating value, low cetane number, lower flash point, higher fuel consumption, high oxides of nitrogen, and poor solubility mainly in cold climates (Mofijur et al., 2015a). Thus, using blends of biodiesel is preferred and have numerous advantages like decrease in exhaust discharges, reduced lubrication oil utilization and practically matching efficiency compared to diesel fuel (Tamilselvan et al., 2017). In doing so, the diesel–ethanol mix may be a decent alternative. However, this mix has stability issue and in addition, inferior physicochemical properties when compared to diesel fuel and needs some additive constituents to stay stable (Mofijur et al., 2015a; Arul Mozhi Selvan et al., 2014). To ease emission and improve the process of combustion in diesel engines, oxygenated fuels like ethanol is advised as an encouraging blending constituent (Lapuerta et al., 2017). Using diesel fuel blended with ethanol in diesel engines has greenhouse gasses emission reduction potential by about 80% (Mofijur et al., 2015b; Berg, 2013). While biodiesel is employed as an auxiliary substance in the diesel–ethanol mix, it boosts the physicochemical assets of the ternary mix, engine performance and furthermore it expands renewable share of the mix (Arul Mozhi Selvan et al., 2014; Shahir et al., 2015a). When formulating a mix of diesel–biodiesel–ethanol, the concentration of utilized ethanol must be ≥ 99%, and its quantity in the mix ought to be not more than 5%. Similarly, the measure of biodiesel must be resolved by its quality (Mofijur et al., 2015a; Shahir et al., 2015b). It is not practicable solution to replace diesel fuel with ethanol completely in compression ignition (CI) engines, but blending diesel with ethanol fuels significantly reduces particulate emissions from CI engines without alteration in its fuel and ignition systems owing to the better oxygen amount in the blend and can mend the cold flow properties of the fuel (Avulapati et al., 2016; Hulwan and Joshi, 2011). The common performance-enhancing techniques pursued diesel engines are modifying the engine, fuel alteration, and exhausts emission management (Avulapati et al., 2016; Basha and Anand, 2013). Nonetheless, engine modification is not the simplest alternative as it additionally magnifies the expense of the engine (Wu et al., 2018) and utilizing exhaust gas handling technique appliances like catalytic converter or diesel particulate filter is not a good option as it influences the performance of CI engines (Khond and Kriplani, 2016). Thus, the addition of fuel seasoning substances to the base fuel is measured as an effective technique of enhancing the physiochemical fuel properties (Avulapati et al., 2016; Chandrasekaran et al., 2016). Usually, fuel modification is done by addition of improver substances such as metal-based materials called nanoparticles (NPs) with the base fuel (Tamilselvan et al., 2017; Basha and Anand, 2013). Nanotechnology is derived from a Greek word “nano” which means ‘dwarf’ that is made by modifying materials at nuclear and sub-atomic scale to form a new sub-atomic structure known as “nanomaterials” (Warad and Dutta, 2004). As per the scientific metric description, the “nano” division is one billionth part of the element. Nanomaterials have astonishing and new features that differ from qualities of the base materials they are attained from, usually with a dimension of less than 100 nm (Ziolkowska, 2018; Saxena et al., 2017a; Venkatesan et al., 2017; López-Serrano et al., 2014). Usually, NPs are considered as nanorods, nanowires, nanofibers, nanoclusters of metals and metal oxide nano-catalysts which are also quite dissimilar from the ordinary catalysts in size and shape (Razack et al., 2014). NPs have exceptional qualities comprising huge explicit surface area, higher surface energy, and considerable dominance that provides a wide dynamic surface for chemical reactions in the formation of 2 nd generation ethanol or biodiesel from transesterification of oils and fats (Rodríguez-Couto, 2019). NPs are added to the base fuel in very small extents extending from 100 parts per million (ppm) to a few thousand ppm which are readily soluble in fuel, and their fundamental objective is to enhance, sustain, and give appreciated qualities to the fuel deprived of influencing the performance and oxidation constraints (Wu et al., 2018; Khond and Kriplani, 2016; Chandrasekaran et al., 2016). This paper reports on the application of Nanoparticles in biofuel production and bioethanol production process. Also, the present work gives a detailed and informative discussion on fuel properties, engine performance, combustion analysis and emissions characteristics with respect to the addition of various alcohol and different nanoparticles in the blends of biodiesel. "
1,Application of nano particles in biofuel production process,"Nanotechnology has been chosen as a potential competitor in the endeavours of biomass degradation and second-generation of biofuel production (Ziolkowska, 2018; Eggert and Greaker, 2014). Advancements and wide range of application of nanotechnology has been reviewed extensively. Fig. 1 shows the various practical utilizations of nanotechnologies (Rodríguez-Couto, 2019), biofuel production and modifying biofuels through nanoparticle loading are currently emerging. The utilization of NPs in the biofuel business has developed as a promising device in giving savvy and process-proficient strategies to enhance biofuel creation (Sekhon, 2014). Biofuel is a name designated to fluid, or vaporous fuels originated from biomass (Berg, 2013), animal fats, and sugars by transesterification and fermentation (Rodríguez-Couto, 2019). The most common methods of producing biofuels from biomasses are thermochemical and biochemical processes. Biofuel production by thermochemical processes are attaining significant considerations as they offer certain and tactical benefits, such as exceptionally shaped mechanical foundation and the biofuels can be supplied from a wide range of available biomass. Thermochemical transformation is a common way of producing biodiesel, bio-oil, bioethanol, bio-hydrogen and bio-syngas (Saoud, 2018). The worldwide biofuel generation in 2014 has expanded to 127.7 billion litres, i.e. by 9%, comprising entire forms of biofuels including vegetable oils, biodiesel, and ethanol (Kushwaha et al., 2018), and estimated to grow to 201 billion litres in 2020 (Kristoufek et al., 2012). However, its generation is confronting many technical barriers because of its energy-intensive production nature (EJ et al., 2017; Rodríguez-Couto, 2019). Bearing in mind the expensive production cost, natural, economic and ecological concerns, the involvement of nanotechnology in the overall process has appeared as a practical way out with an option to establish strong nano-biocatalytic scheme with low cost of production in a sustainable manner (Ziolkowska, 2018; EJ et al., 2017; Rodríguez-Couto, 2019). Numerous known energies generating organizations are spending huge amount of money to realize the activities of converting second and third-generation feedstocks into bioethanol (Kushwaha et al., 2018), besides it is helpful for the recovery of catalysts (Rodríguez-Couto, 2019). It can reduce feedstocks transportation cost, advance feedstock preparation efficiency, better oil extraction yield, and productivity, which might eventually help to decrease the biofuels generation costs and lessen the ecological footprint (Ziolkowska, 2018). The utilization of nanotechnology compromises a steady and compassionate enzymatic system that can endure the unfriendly impacts of different diluents utilized to produce biodiesel (Rodríguez-Couto, 2019). For example, the major cost of microalgae biodiesel production is consumed by the lipid extraction processes due to the complex nature of its carbohydrates and glycoproteins chemical resistance (Lee et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2013). But with the use of NPs, reliable, safe and easier means of lipid extraction with higher oil yield along with lower-cost production is possible (Zhang et al., 2013). NPs Metals (Fe, Al, Mg, Mn, Ag, Au, Cu, B, Si, etc.), metallic oxides (Al2O3, Co3O4, CeO 2, TiO 2, ZnO, CuO etc.), and metallic combinations (Mg–Al, Carbon nanotubes (CNT)) etc., are used as an additive chemical in biofuel production and utilization to enhance the fuel physiochemical properties and fuel performances (EJ et al., 2017; Rodríguez-Couto, 2019; Basha and Anand, 2013). For financially practical large-scale biodiesel production, magnetic NPs based catalysts are beneficial because of their capacity to be effectively detached from process media and be reused (Gardy et al., 2018). The biocatalysts immobilization within lipase-catalyzed biodiesel and cellulosic ethanol generation procedure is another promising use of nanotechnology in the biofuel business (Kim et al., 2018). Enzyme immobilization is a fascinating strategy used to advance mechanical procedures by settling a biocatalyst in biocompatible and passive approach (Romo-Sánchez et al., 2014). Compared with free biocatalyst, it offers a few preferences such as enhancement of catalyst filling and activity, better thermal and pH steadiness, recovery and biocatalyst reusability (Eş et al., 2015). Nano-encapsulation, frame-up with silaffin, and adsorption are some of the methods shaped for proteins immobilization utilizing NPs, which could have the reduction of biofuel production costs (Zhang et al., 2013). Additionally, processes such as; progressive fermentation, rapid catalytic pyrolysis, jet fuels, reactant transformation of syngas, hydrocarbon bio-refineries, biofuel cell, biochar, carbon capture and storage, gasification, thermal liquefaction, conversion and enhancement of ethanol are some of the potential areas in biofuel production where nanotechnology might conceivably realize leaps forward (Nizami and Rehan, 2018)."
2,Application of NPs in biodiesel production,"2.1 Application of NPs in biodiesel production Biodiesel (fatty acid methyl or ethyl ester) is synthesized fuel developed from the vegetable oils that usually happen in natural renewable sources and from animal fats via esterification and trans-esterification processes of FFAs (free fatty acids) and triglycerides, respectively. It can be produced from different oil crops, animal fats or from lipid extracted from algae (EJ et al., 2017; Hussein, 2015; Vijay Kumar et al., 2018; Leung et al., 2010; Murugesan et al., 2009). The most common biodiesel production methods are batch reaction, ultrasonic reactor, supercritical process and lipase-catalyzed method (Mishra, 2018). Straight oils formed from renewable resources are synthetically prepared by transesterification, in which alcohol and base catalysts are added to the pure oil under reasonable conditions. During the course of esterification reaction, the triglycerides in oil converts into alkyl esters and glycerol. Transesterification reaction takes place in 50 to 80 °C temperature ranges in the presence of ethanol/methanol and base catalysts such as Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH) (Basha and Anand, 2013; Hashmi et al., 2016). Nanotechnology has pulled in a notable procedure of enthusiasm for the rationalization of biodiesel generation through the use of NPs based catalysts and has prompted the advancement of proficiency, financially robust, and nano-catalysts stability, holding the possibility to accomplish higher product value and produces (Nizami and Rehan, 2018). Though, there are very few reports where the immediate use of NPs as nutritional additions in feedstock generation, an investigation performed by Sarma et al. (2014) on microalga Chlorella Vulgaris enriched with MgSO 4 NPs, and organic-carbon basis have disclosed an improved photosynthetic effectiveness with a notable decrease in glycerol utilization, with a rise in lipid products (Sarma et al., 2014). To amplify the development of microalgae (Chlorella Vulgaris species) for high lipid extraction, Silica NPs (SiO 2) and methyl functionalized silica (SiO 2-CH3) were utilized. Utilizing SiO 2-CH3 NPs with a dry mass of 1.49 g/L has acquired a higher outcome compared to controlled experimentation. Moreover, by using 1.00 g/L of SiO 2-CH3 NPs a supreme product of FAME (fatty acid methyl ester) was attained from the cells of C. Vulgaris. Similarly mixing of 0.2% by weight of SiO 2-CH3 NPs improved the dry mass and FAME efficiency by 210% and 610%, correspondingly (Jeon et al., 2017). A study by Shah et al. (2007) reported ethyl butyrate transesterification by immobilizing lipase into CNT has attained about 97% lipase action (Shah et al., 2007). In biodiesel generation, the fat mining process adds one of the real parts of the whole expense (Lee et al., 2015). Recently, the most widely recognized methodology of removing lipid is by the utilization of various solvents such as chloroform, methanol, and hexane, utilized either solely or in mixture form in various ratios and the lipid yield fluctuates altogether with the utilization of various dissolvable mixes (Nizami and Rehan, 2018). To eradicate algae from fish ponds and freshwater bodies, magnetic iron oxide NPs are utilized (Wang et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2013). In another investigation, 80% increase in activity of lipase has been demonstrated by using nano-gel polymer in contrast with 10% action of free lipase (Ge et al., 2009). About 94% butyl biodiesel generation was accomplished by utilizing of electrospun polyacrylonitrile nano fibre (Sakai et al., 2010). By using PCL (P. Cepacia Lipase) immobilized on Fe3O4 magnetic NPs, full percent transformation of oil into biodiesel is described (Wang et al., 2009) in the presentation of covalent bond T. lanuginosus fat with amino-functionalized attractive NPs, 90% biodiesel transformation efficiency was accomplished (Xie and Ma, 2010). 94.8% conversion of biodiesel from olive oil at 150 °C in 8 h response time utilizing ZnO nanorods mixture as catalysts were reported in Molina (2013) master’s thesis (Molina, 2013). Moreover, magnetic NPs offer pronounced suitability and minimal cost option because of their modest recapture from reaction mixtures and improved thermal reliability (Verma et al., 2013)."
3,Application of NPs in bioethanol production,"2.2 Application of NPs in bioethanol production Ethanol is a low-cost oxygenated fuel that can be produced from sugarcane, sugar beet, corn, barley, molasses, and cassava root by alcoholic fermentation procedure with high oxygen contented 34% (wt) (Hulwan and Joshi, 2011). Bioethanol is the most widely recognized biofuel, representing over 90% of aggregate use. It is produced by enzymatic transformation of starch-containing biomass into sugars by fermentation and sugars and to ethanol (Hashmi et al., 2016). The use of NPs within the ethanol formation process assists in enhancing the whole efficiency of the system by boosting the ability of handling, enzymatic hydrolysis, and improving the degree of reaction in the course of fermentation (Chaturvedi et al., 2012). Immobilization over the bi-functionalized nano provision constituents gives the best introduction to the enzyme dynamic spots and furthermore expands the action and dependability (Cipolatti et al., 2014). By utilizing NPs higher measure of chemicals can be immobilized because of their high surface area, and a superior bio-catalytic action and stability could be accomplished, which offers lower mass transfer resistance in contrast with macro particle size (Verma et al., 2013). One of the basic issues in ethanol formation is catalyst reusability due to its immediate effect on the cost of production (Miletić et al., 2012). Using NPs in the production of ethanol from lignocellulosic based biomass in biorefineries is putting forth other innovative upgrades for the complex production procedures and recovery of cellulose catalysts (Rodríguez-Couto, 2019). In the syngas fermentation process, 166.1% bioethanol production is informed using methyl functionalized silica NPs; though, recovery of the NPs for reuse was difficult (Kim et al., 2014). In another study using functionalized silica magnetic NPs, higher ethanol production (213.5%) is reported by using cobalt-ferrite-silica (CoFe 2O4@SiO 2-CH3) (Kim and Lee, 2016). In the presence of magnetic NPs, enhanced bioethanol fermentation with an efficiency of 91% of the theoretical yield is reported by Ivanova et al. (2011). Shiny carbon electrode amended by graphene oxide NPs utilized to determine the complete reduction of sugars into ethanol, and better precision and reusability of the prepared scheme was attained (Santos et al., 2016). Though the utilization of NPs in the field of generation of biofuels is in a lab-scale, wide assortments of NPs has been utilized for biomass pretreatment and its conversion into biofuels. Their efficiency has been effectively revealed and has been demonstrated the practicality and reusability of NPs-based approaches are better than the conventional systems. The foremost disadvantages of the conventional biofuel production process such as; the slow rate of reaction, higher cost of production, lower efficiency, and poor quality and lower quantity of product can be improved by effective utilization of NPs."
4,"The influence of nanoparticles on performance, combustion, and emission characteristics","Recently, academic research society is giving attention to the reliability features of biofuels and enhancement of engine performance elements and burning qualities to reduce the exhaust discharges of regular diesel engines by utilizing NPs loaded diesel–biodiesel fuel mixes. Latest investigational studies on utilizing nano-sized metals, nonmetals, natural and blended elements in the base fuel for diesel engine have shown up in existing literature. A review of Shaafi et al. (2015) describes that fuel modification is among the essential techniques to increase performance and minimize exhaust emission compared to engine modification and after discharged gas handling procedures. The utilization of NPs as additive substances in diesel enhances thermo-physical properties by improving the larger surface area to volume fraction, thermal conductivity, and mass diffusivity when distributed in liquid medium (Shaafi et al., 2015). It is largely discovered that the direct use of biodiesel or biodiesel–alcohol mixes in diesel engine declines the power because of lower calorific values in contrast to pure diesel fuel. Methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, pentanol and diesel fuels have a calorific value of 20.08 MJ/kg, 26.83 MJ/kg, 29.82 MJ/kg, 32.01 MJ/kg, 32.16 MJ/kg and 42.8 MJ/kg, respectively (EJ et al., 2017; Zaharin et al., 2017). An investigative inspection according to IS 1448 standards depicts that the addition of 5% ethanol by volume to Jatropha, Soybean, Palm, and Cottonseed based biodiesel with diesel decreases the kinematic viscosity, pour point and cloud point of biodiesel blends (Madiwale et al., 2018). Oxygen amount is the fundamental factor in enhancing efficiency as it improves combustion with methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol and pentanol comprising 49.93 %, 34.73%, 36.62%, 21.59%, and 18.15% of oxygen content by weight, respectively. Due to the higher combustion temperature, biodiesel–alcohol has higher NOx discharges reaching up to 22% due to their higher oxygen content. In the meantime, it brings down CO releases as much as 33%, decrease the productions of HC by 96% and PM discharges by about 76% when contrasted with that of diesel fuel (EJ et al., 2017; Zaharin et al., 2017). A study piloted to investigate the effect of ethanol in an SC-4S diesel engine with the variable speed at full load by varying ethanol amount has described that with the ethanol ratio increment, the level of HC and CO emission HRR and in-cylinder pressure has increased. Conversely, the level of CO2 and NO x are reduced considerably along with shortened oxidation period and enhanced ignition delay (ID) (Mirzajanzadeh et al., 2015). Simulation utilizing Diesel-RK commercial software has been piloted to assess the performance, combustion and exhaust gas release qualities of a DICI diesel engine operating with typical biodiesel mixed with alcohol as fuel by Datta and Mandal (2017) to study the impacts of ethanol and methanol addition to palm-based biodiesel. The anticipated outcomes demonstrated marginally higher BSFC and BTE compared with neat biodiesel. The impact is found to be more with the methanol added blend. Moreover, the BSFC increment is high in the case of the alcohol biodiesel blend. The maximum in-cylinder temperature reduces with the ethanol and methanol mixed biodiesel, whereas, no substantial deviation is detected with the exhaust smoke temperature. HRR is observed for the alcohol blended biodiesel while the peak pressure rise inside the combustion chamber during combustion is lower. By adding 15% of ethanol and 15% of methanol by volume independently to biodiesel declines the NO x discharge by 30% and 19%, respectively. Though no substantial impact on CO2 discharge is noted, an insignificant decrease in CO2 release is seen with methanol. Then, PM and smoke discharge rise highly with the alcohols blended biodiesel compared to the neat biodiesel (Datta and Mandal, 2017). Tse et al. (2015) tested the effect of diesel–biodiesel–ethanol (DBE) mixed fuels their burning qualities and their particulate releases from a diesel engine, where, diesel and biodiesel are mixed with 0%, 5%, 10% and 20% ethanol carried in a four-stroke DI diesel engine at 1800 rpm constant speed under five test conditions. Equated with neat diesel fuelled​ engine, the high heat rate (HHR) and the cylinder pressure are improved with the addition of ethanol in the mix. Decrease in PM by mass and by number, with a diminishing of NO x discharges, and prompting lower BSPM, BSPN and BSNO x that can hinder the PM–PN–NOx trade-off relationship was observed (Tse et al., 2015). An assessment conducted by Zhang and Balasubramanian (2016) using an SC-4S DI diesel engine to determine impacts of mixing butanol and pentanol with biodiesel in the diesel engine. The test uses 10% butanol and 20% pentanol by volume. Their impact on engine performance and the physicochemical attributes of PM discharges driven at steady engine speed and three different load conditions contrasted with biodiesel, butanol-biodiesel mixes lead to an improvement in brake thermal efficiency (BTE) by 1.6% and a growth of 1.9–3.9% in the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) at lower and medium engine loads, compared to the biodiesel fuelled engine. Furthermore, it has brought an enhancement in BTE, an increment in BSFC by 2% and lessens the PM and elemental carbon (EC) discharges. Conversely, the extent of particulate bound organic carbon (OC) and water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) show increment for all mixed fuels (Zhang and Balasubramanian, 2016). A study with the aim of assessing the impact of utilizing butanol in diesel–biodiesel mixed fuel in engine performance and exhausts releases of a full load operating DI diesel engine lead by Atmanlıet al. (2014). Pure canola hazelnut cottonseed oil (CHC) and slick sunflower corn–soybean oil (SCS) mixes were set up as equivalent %vol by sprinkle mixing technique. 70%vol 0f diesel fuel and 10% of butanol were included in CHC and SCS mixes (signified as DCHCnB and DSCSnB), respectively. As per the engine performance and gases discharge test values of DCHCnB and DSCSnB, mean estimates of torque decrease by 6.08% and 6.67%, brake power reduction of 4.12% and 4.59%, BTE decline by 10.80% and 11.66%, exhausts gas temperature lessening of 15.11% and 14.99%, carbon dioxide(CO2) cut of 1.12% and 2.30% and hydrocarbon (HC) declined 36.71% and 32.28%, respectively are detected. In contrast, BSFC escalation of 18.43% and 19.58%, oxides of (NO x ) rise by 27.27% and 30.36% and carbon monoxide (CO) surge by 41.57% and 26.89%, respectively are found higher than pure diesel fuel (Atmanlıet al., 2014). A study conducted by Imdadul et al. (2016) of fuel properties, thermal stability, performance and exhaust discharges of an SC-4S DI diesel engine operating with pentanol in diesel–biodiesel mixes alongside EHN (2-Ethylhexyl nitrate) combustion reformer was conducted. EHN in biodiesel–alcohol mix decreases the density of the fuel with a minor decrement of viscosity and calorific value when compared to diesel and alcohol washed biodiesel mixes. Though, the cetane number of the reformed mixes was enriched by 6.06% and 14.67% correspondingly for the PB20P5E1 and PB20P5E2 weighed with PB20P5. Correspondingly, weighed with PB10Pn10 the rise was 5.12% and 11.2% exclusively. The thermal stability of EHN added adjusted mixes was found to be extended. The more addition of EHN extent in the mixes makes the thermal stability steady. The brake power and BSFC of the EHN treated mixes was similarly enhanced than the alcohol-treated biodiesel mix. The adjustment of the ternary mixes by including EHN displayed more cetane number, reduced injection delay (ID), lesser NO x and decreased smoke discharge. Although increased HC and CO release were detected (Imdadul et al., 2016). Srinivasa Rao and Anand (2016) show the working attributes of biodiesel in CI engines is essentially affected in the presence of water and NPs. As the experimental result shows, the biodiesel has lower BTE and higher emissions than pure diesel fuel. The performance and discharge qualities of the test engine were remarkably upgraded by the inclusion of water and NPs (Srinivasa Rao and Anand, 2016). An experiment carried out by Hosseini et al. (2017) to assess performance and exhaust gas release of SC-4S CI at engine speeds of 1800, 2300, and 2800 rpm using CNTs as an added substance with B5 and B10 blended diesel fuel utilizing 30, 60, and 90 ppm CNTs concentrations in each blend revealed that CNT addition shows an impressive improvement in BTE with, a 8.12% increase and a SFC reduction of 7.12%, accompanied by an increase in EGT (5.57%). CO, HC, and soot diminished respectively by 65.70%, 44.98%, and 29.41%. Whereas NO x increased by 27.49%, as shown in Fig. 2 (Hosseini et al., 2017). A related work reported by Vellaiyan (2019) has investigated the effect CNT addition on the combustion, performance and emissions of diesel soybean biodiesel and their blends fuelled in diesel engine. The nanoparticle blending was performed with the help of an ultrasonic emulsifier. 100 ppm of CNT nanoparticle was used in the study. A drop of 4.5% in BSFC is noticed for CNT nanoparticle included fuels at maximum BMEP condition, and a drop of 4.9, 3.7, and 4.7% in EGT has been noted with CNT nanoparticle included base fuels contrasted with neat base fuels. The CNT nanoparticle consideration in PD and SB advances better burning, performance, and greener discharges. The CNT nanoparticle incorporation with base fuels fundamentally improves the burning, performance, and discharges level independent of engine load conditions (Vellaiyan, 2019). A test to analyse the impact of CNT on the discharge qualities of neem biodiesel-fuelled (NBD) diesel engine led by Ramakrishnan et al. (2019) was completed and the outcomes compared with ordinary diesel. The NBD discharges 4.8% higher NO diesel at peak load operation and CNT nanoparticle consideration at 100 ppm advances 9.2% lower NOx contrasted with NBD. The Overall HC and CO discharges are 6.8% and 4.7% lower for NBD compared with diesel. CNT expansion at 100 ppm further decreases the HC and CO emissions by 6.7% and 5.9%, respectively, compared to NBD. The amount of CO2 emission in NBD is 6.6% higher than diesel at full load conditions. The CNT consideration with NBD further builds the CO2 discharge because of complete burning. The smoke of NBD is 2.1% lower than diesel. The addition of CNT at various ppm further lessens its smoke discharge by 7.8% when contrasted with NBD (Ramakrishnan et al., 2019) . Similarly, investigational assessments using biodiesel–diesel mixes with different proportion of palm oil biodiesel in Cummins diesel engine to study impacts of the addition of carbon layered aluminium (Al@C) in engine performance and combustion byproduct releases was carried out by Wu et al. (2018). The experimental outcome of diesel–biodiesel (10%) mix, diesel–biodiesel blend with ethanol (4%), and with both ethanol (4%) and 30 ppm of Al@C NPs demonstrated that enhancement of engine BTE is seen with reduction BSFC by 6%, a decrease in NO X discharge of 6% alongside a drop of 19% in CO discharge and an increased HC outflow 2.2 times in the presence of Al@C is detected. Besides, the Al@C NPs is found converted into Al2O3 after the combustion process (Wu et al., 2018). The effect of nanoparticle size on the performance and emission characteristics was investigated by Devarajan et al. (2019) with in biodiesel-powered diesel engine with copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticle of 10 and 20 nm sizes. The base oil used for the production of biodiesel in the study is not clear from the manuscript as two different sources are used in the abstract and main body, namely Mahua and soybean. The performance parameters were contrasted with regular diesel fuel. The concentration of the nano particle is fixed at 100 ppm in the current study. BSFC of BD100 is accounted for to be higher than that of diesel while BTE is lower than that of diesel (D100). Blending of 10 nm molecule size of CuO nanoparticle in BD100 has reduced the BSFC by 1.3% and improved the BTE by 0.7% when contrasted with BD100. The CuO nanoparticle consideration at 20 nm nanoparticle in biodiesel further improves the performance boundaries than those at 10 nm nanoparticle. Further, the BD100 advances a lower level of smoke discharges, carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrocarbon (HC), and a conspicuous expansion in oxides of nitrogen (NOx) discharge. The consideration of 10 nm molecule size of CuO nanoparticle in BD100 lessens the Ox, HC, CO, and smoke emissions by 3.9, 5.6,4.9, and 2.8%, respectively. Overall, an improvement on BTE, decrease in BSEF and emissions of the major pollutant gases is observed with an addition of 20 nm CuO (Devarajan et al., 2019). Yuvarajan et al. (2018) carried out an experiment utilizing a vertical, AC SC-4S diesel engine driven with diesel, neat mustard oil methyl ester (MOME) and MOME emulsions containing TiO 2 NPs to resolve the impact of TiO 2 NPs on the emission qualities of the blended fuel. The adding of TiO 2 NPs into the base fuel resulted in a decrease of HC, CO and smoke discharges in all test conditions, and NO x discharges were declined fundamentally (Yuvarajan et al., 2018). Örs et al. (2018) demonstrated the addition of butanol to diesel and biodiesel from waste cooking oil mix influenced the majority of the vital properties of the blend. TiO 2 NPs influences engine performance positively as well as declines the BSFC. In addition, it reduced exhaust emissions by enhancing the ignition process (Örs et al., 2018). Correspondingly, enhanced properties of conventional diesel and better BTE and lower BSFC due to the addition of TiO 2 NPs is reported by D’Silva et al. (2015) compared to diesel fuel. Moreover, the emission of CO and HC is reduced by about 25% and 18%, respectively (D’Silva et al., 2015). The work by Vellaiyan (2019) is focused on the addition of TiO 2 with water in diesel emulsion fuel. The exhaust gas emissions was characterized by fuelling it in diesel engine under different BMEP conditions. They have tested water content of 5 and 10% and TiO 2 concentration of 50 and 100 ppm for the test fuel preparation. The have used Sorbitan monolaurate as a surfactant and an ultrasonic emulsifier for the emulsion preparation. It is reported that HC and CO emissions with the emulsion fuel are higher at lower engine loads. The trend changes with the engine load increasing. The 10% water in BD decreases the EGT by about 8.8% at the topmost BMEP condition. A consideration of TiO 2 nanoparticles fundamentally improves the emission qualities (Vellaiyan et al., 2019). An investigative inspection on diesel engine working at variable states of load and speed using Alumina NPs to a blend of Jojoba biodiesel (JBD) and regular diesel fuel at the proportion of 20% and 80%, respectively, at ratios ranging from 10–50 mg/l homogenized with an ultrasonicator blender shows that the BTE is improved by about 7%, total BSFC is lessened by about 6%, 70% of NO x , 75% of CO, about 5% of smoke blackness, and around 55% of UHC was observed when contrasted with a fuel blended with only 20% biodiesel is utilized. For ultimate engine performance operation, the appropriate NPs addition percentage is found to be around 30 mg/l (Attia et al., 2014). Radhakrishnan and Munuswamy (2018) have investigated the effect of alumina nanoparticles addition with cashew nutshell biodiesel. The difference of this work with other related works is that the nanoparticle is added before the transesterification to the raw cashew nutshell oil. However, there is no comparison on the performance and emissions of post and pre-transesterification nanoparticle addition in contrary to the problem statement. A comparative report to explore the impact of alumina nanoparticles on emission and performance attributes of a diesel engine. The exploratory outcomes on unmodified diesel engine show that discharge parameters like CO, HC, NOx, and smoke were diminished by 5.3%, 7.4%, 10.23%, and 16.1% for BD100% and 8.8%, 10.1%, 12.4%, and 18.4% for B100 A, respectively, contrasted with diesel fuel. At full load conditions, contrasted with diesel fuel, the BTE dropped by 1.1% and 2.3%, while the BSFC expanded by 3.8% and 5.1% for B100 A and B100, respectively (Radhakrishnan and Munuswamy, 2018). An investigation to comprehend the impacts of CNT and CeO 2 NPs as fuel-borne NPs added substances in performance, burning and emission release qualities of a VCR CI engine under different mixing ratios of CERIA-CNT in diesel–ethanol blend fuel was done by Arul Mozhi Selvan et al. (2014). In light of the experimental inspections, the BTE raises by 7.5% the gas pressure in the cylinder and the maximum HHR was found advanced. The 50 ppm CERIA-CNT included mixes (E20 + CERIA 50 + CNT 50) boost the CO by 22.2%, improve the burning quality and decreases the hydrocarbon and smoke discharge by 7.2% and 47.6%, respectively, but did not show a massive decrease on the nitrogen oxide discharge with regarding to the E20 blend (Arul Mozhi Selvan et al., 2014). An analysis conducted in a steady speed diesel engine in four stages utilizing pure jatropha based biodiesel, Alumina mixed biodiesel, CNT mixed biodiesel, and Al2O3 – CNT mixed biodiesel fuels in mass portions of 2 5 ppm and 50 ppm shows impressive improvement in BTE and a significant decrease in destructive discharges for the NP mixed biodiesel fuels contrasted with those of straight biodiesel fuel. Besides, the influence of reduced ignition delay and enhanced thermal conductivity rate related to the NPs mixed biodiesel fuels are obtained (Basha and Anand, 2013). An analysis to determine the impact of consolidated CeO 2 and MWCNT NPs added with B5 and B10 diesel; biodiesel mixes in a DI diesel engine with NPs proportion ratio of 30, 60 and 90ppm was accomplished by Mirzajanzadeh et al. (2015). From the outcomes discovered, it is reported that an enhancement in the combustion and huge decrease in the exhaust gas discharge is depicted—improved power and torque (engine performance) by about 7.81% and 4.91% respectively. Reduced BSFC of 4.50% ( Fig. 3 ) is described when utilizing B20 and 90 ppm NPs in the mix. Besides, a decrease of 26.3%, 71.4% and 18.9% of HC, CO and NO x respectively is stated contrasted with that of B20 fuel (Mirzajanzadeh et al., 2015). Ghanbari et al. (2017) examined performance and exhausts gas discharges qualities of diesel engine working on nano-diesel biodiesel mixed fuel with genetic programming (GP) simulation model by using selected measurable criteria of root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of assurance (R2). 40 ppm, 80 ppm and 120 ppm CNT and 40 ppm, 80 ppm and 120 ppm nanosilver particles were prepared and added as improver substance to biodiesel diesel mixed fuel. 6-cylinder, AC-4S, DI diesel engine with the distributed system was filled with these new mixed energizes and worked at varying engine speeds. The investigational test outcomes demonstrated adding NPs to diesel, and biodiesel mixed fuel increases engine performance factors including engine power and torque yield up to 2% increment, BSFC was reduced by 7.08%. CO2 discharge expanded by 17.03% and CO outflow of biodiesel diesel fuel with NPs was lower essentially (25.17%). HC discharge with silver nano diesel–biodiesel mixed fuel lessened (28.56%) while energizes, which contains CNT NPs expanded by 14.21%. By adding NPs to the fuel, NO x amplified by 25.32% contrasted with the net diesel fuel (Ghanbari et al., 2017). A study concentrated on the synchronous use of water (3, 5, and 7 wt%) and CeO 2 NPs (90 ppm) as metal-based additional substance into biodiesel and diesel fuel mix (B5) and their effects on the performance and exhaust discharge attributes of an SC-4S diesel engine was inspected by Khalife et al. (2017). The results discovered that the burning quality was enhanced by the fluid nano-emulsion of CeO 2 NPs. Clearly, the BSFC of B5 containing 3% of water and 90 ppm of CeO 2 (B5W3m) was found 5% and 16% lower than pure B5 and neat B5 containing 3% water (B5W3), respectively. Furthermore, B5W3 fuel mixes raise the BTE by more than 23% and 11% with respect to B5W3 and B5, respectively. Furthermore, remarkably lessened CO, HC, and NOx releases by 51%, 45%, and 27%, respectively (Khalife et al., 2017). A study by EL-Seesy et al. (2018) with the addition of graphene oxide (GO) to jatropha methyl ester (JME) in one cylinder AC-DICI diesel engine is stated to have great improvement in efficiency parameters and a huge reduction in exhaust emission discharges with a GO concentration of 50 mg/l (EL-Seesy et al., 2018). Similarly, the same author in his another study using a GO NPs added to diesel–biodiesel blend (B20) in a fraction of 25, 50, 75 and 100 mg/l demonstrated that, improved BTE and lesser BSFC in addition to a significant reduction in the overall emission reduction is reported especially at 50 mg/l dosage (El-Seesy et al., 2018). Another experimental engine test conducted by [33] at a constant speed of 2100 rpm with a varying load to evaluate effect of GO addition to conventional diesel fuel showed that most performance parameters were found enhanced along with a significant reduction in BSFC. Moreover, the results of exhaust analysis showed that CO reduces by 7 to 20%, HC decreased by 15 to 28%. However, a slight increase in CO2 (6%–10%) and NOx (5%–8%) is reported (Hoseini et al., 2018). Chen et al. (2018) conducted an experiment utilizing three different kinds of NPs (Al2O3, CNT and SiO 2) dispersed in measurements of 25 ppm, 50 ppm and 100 ppm with neat diesel at engine loads of 0%, 25%, half, 75% and 100% at a steady engine speed of 1800 rpm. The author reported that the BSFC was lessened by 19.8% and BTE improved by 18.8%. SiO 2 mixes demonstrate preferable outcomes over Al2O3 mixes in several sides, such as higher BTE and lower BSFC along with lower CO discharges. Al2O3 and SiO 2 indicate stable mix conditions, then the diesel blends with CNT, while CNT blend show an improve BSFC and BTE by about 19.85% and 18.80%, respectively (Chen et al., 2018). Similarly, A better BTE and lower BSFC is described by Kumar et al. (2017) by adding ferrous based NPs into a diesel–biodiesel blended fuel along with a significant reduction in exhaust emission (Kumar et al., 2017). The outcomes are extremely inspiring due to the sound upgrade in thermo-physical and chemical properties of improved fuel, such as, high surface to volume proportion, higher responsive mode for ignition, upgraded thermal and mass transport properties because of higher heat conductivity, flash point enhancement, flash point, pour point and so forth relying on the kind of Nps utilized, their molecular size and fraction with base fuel (Saxena et al., 2017b). "
5,Discussion,
6,Performance,"4.1 Performance The addition of oxygenated fuels to diesel fuel increases the oxygen content of the blend and reduces the density and viscosity (Madiwale et al., 2018; Imdadul et al., 2016). Use of higher ethanol percentages in diesel–biodiesel–ethanol blend reduces BTE and increases the BSFC (Atmanlıet al., 2014). BSFC is a vital engine performance indicator, and at all times its lesser amount is anticipated. It tells us how much amount of the fuel delivered to the engine is converted efficiently into useful work. The following points can be drawn from the works of literature surveyed as summarized in Table 3. The use of metallic and metallic oxide NPs and their combinations such as Al2O3, Al2O3+ CeO 2, Al2O3+ CuO, CuO, Rh2O3, CNT, Al@C, CeO 2+ CNT, TiO 2, GO, graphene, and ferrous fluid additives with diesel fuel or diesel blended with biodiesel and ethanol in DICI diesel engines increase the BTE by about 1%–25% (Arul Mozhi Selvan et al., 2014; Basha and Anand, 2013; Wu et al., 2018; Hosseini et al., 2017; Örs et al., 2018; Attia et al., 2014; EL-Seesy et al., 2018; Kumar et al., 2017; Gumus et al., 2016; Perumal and Ilangkumaran, 2018; Manibharathi et al., 2014) mainly attributed to their catalytic effect and better combustion compared to diesel and its blends with biodiesel and ethanol without NPs additives (Sadhik Basha, 2013). Diesel fuel blended with 20% of biodiesel using graphene NPs, JME used with GO NPs, diesel fuel blended with 20% of JME and using a combined NPs of Al2O3 and CeO 2 and a diesel–biodiesel–n-butanol blend with TiO 2 NPs as an additive in diesel engines are reported as more effective to increase the BTE of DICI diesel engines by 25.%, 20%, 12%, and 9.74%, respectively (Örs et al., 2018; EL-Seesy et al., 2018; El-Seesy et al., 2018; Prabu, 2017). Similarly, significant improvement of combustion, performance and emissions at all engine loads is reported with the blending of 100 ppm CNT in both pure diesel and biodiesel beside their blends (Vellaiyan, 2019). The effect of TiO 2 nanoparticle blending on the performance of 20% of Calophyllum Inophyllum biodiesel with 80% diesel (B20) is investigated. The BTE is reported to increase by 3.1% as compared to the base blend fuel (B20) when the engine is operated at 1500 rpm, and engine load varied at 0, 25, 50, 75, 100% (Praveen et al., 2018). Different concentrations of TiO2 (50 and 100 ppm) are also utilized as a blend with Pongamia based biodiesel to study the combustion, performance and emissions in a single-cylinder four-stroke diesel engine. An improvement on the brake specific fuel consumption and BTE is reported with both concentrations (Rangabashiam et al., 2019). A waste fry oil methyl ester [WFOME] from the potato chips industry used to produce biodiesel. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes in 25 ppm and 50 ppm mass fraction were then added to WFOME to prepare biodiesel blend. An experimental test performed on a twin-cylinder four-strokes diesel engine fuelled with biodiesel–MWCNT mixes to study at its performance, ignition, and emission qualities. The test result shows improved BTE, better burning property, and lesser UHC emissions. Contrasting the addition of 10 ppm, 32 ppm, and 50 ppm MWCNT into WFOME, The UHC exhaust is exceptionally less for the 10 ppm at full load contrasted with clean diesel fuel. The 50 ppm addition shows lesser CO discharge. Moreover, decreased opacity and shorter ID delay when utilizing MWCNT nanoparticles in mixed fuels (Sulochana and Bhatti, 2019). Ooi et al. examined the impacts of graphite oxide (GO), single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), and cerium oxide (CeO 2) nanoparticles on the burning, performance, and discharge qualities of a four-stroke single-cylinder diesel engine under different engine loads. Shortened ID, improved ignition, shortened burning duration, improved BSFC, decreased CO outflow, and lesser UHCs discharges of 10.3%, 18.5%, 14.6%, 15.2%, 23.4%, and 24.1%, respectively were accomplished with the addition of SWCNTs nanoparticle at 25 ppm proportion ratio. SWCNTs and GO added substances could be a practical methodology for decreasing the emissions from diesel engines (Ooi et al., 2018). The increase in BSFC is dependent on the amount of the biofuel share in the blend. Improved BSFC in favour of the NPs added fuel blends are reported in most of the experimental results ranging from 0.5%–28.37% (Örs et al., 2018; Kumar et al., 2017; Gumus et al., 2016). Similarly, this could be attributed to NPs enhanced surface area to volume ratio and their catalytic effect during combustion (De Luca et al., 2005). However, the BSFC had increased when Al2O3 NPs added with D70B20E10 and Al2O3 combined with CeO 2 NPs added with JBD B20 is used in DICI diesel engines (Venu and Madhavan, 2017; Prabu, 2017). The addition of TiO 2 NPs in diesel–biodiesel–n-butanol blends and neat diesel fuel and the use of graphene NPs in B20 showed higher BSFC reductions (Örs et al., 2018; D’Silva et al., 2015; El-Seesy et al., 2018), and the least BSFC reduction is observed from using CuO NPs with B20 and Al2O3 combined with CuO NPs mixed with pure diesel (Gumus et al., 2016; Perumal and Ilangkumaran, 2018). The application of NPs in fuels with lower calorific value such as biodiesel and ethanol boosts fuel properties and improves BTE and reduces BSFC along with the reduction of harmful exhaust emissions (Rangabashiam et al., 2019)."
7,Combustion,"4.2 Combustion Ignition delay (ID) is characterized as the time span elapsed amid the start of fuel injection into the engine cylinder to the beginning of burning inside the combustion chamber (Dorado et al., 0000). Most pieces of literature depicted that fuel blends added with NPs have shorter ID compared to that of neat fuels. Type of fuels utilized and their amount in the cylinder charge are fundamental factors that influence ID significantly. The primary variables in charge of controlling the length of the ID of the engine are changes related with the charge temperature amid pressurization, pre-ignition energy discharge, and heat transfer to environment (Anon, 2019; Liu and Karim, 1995). Cylinder pressure makes the fuel to blend immediately with air and to begin burning inside the engine combustion chamber. The use of biofuel blends with diesel enhances the latent heat of the blend and improves the in-cylinder pressure by improving the air–fuel mixture formation during the ID period. Higher cylinder pressure is usually related to extra fuel burnt during the premixed oxidation stage (Venu and Madhavan, 2017). The HRR and in-cylinder pressure is improved by the addition of ethanol in diesel–biodiesel blend (Tse et al., 2015). Addition of Al2O3 NPs into D70B20E10 blends of diesel–biodiesel–ethanol, CeO 2+ CNT into E20, TiO 2 into diesel–biodiesel–n-butanol, GO into JME, and graphene into B20 has improved the HRR and in-cylinder pressure of DICI diesel engines (Arul Mozhi Selvan et al., 2014; Örs et al., 2018; Venu and Madhavan, 2017). In contrast, the use of Al2O3+ CeO 2 into E20 has resulted in decreased HRR and in-cylinder pressure (Prabu, 2017), which could be attributed to the early combustion, reduced ID, improved combustion due to NPs, higher cetane number, a greater rate of evaporation and better surface area to volume ratio (Basha and Anand, 2011b,a)."
8,Emissions,"4.3 Emissions Emission of CO from a diesel engine is low as it usually operates in lean arrangements of the stoichiometric air–fuel mixture ratio. However, the combustion of oxygenated biofuel mixes in diesel engine alters the CO production. Addition of biodiesel and ethanol into diesel fuel with NPs additive substances changes the fuel properties and the oxygen measure of the mix and then influences the CO arrangement. Generally exhaust emission of HC, CO and smoke reduces by the use of biofuels as additives in diesel engines. Considerable reduction in the emission of HC and CO is reported when higher oxygenated fuels are used in diesel, biodiesel ethanol blends, correspondingly the number of PM decreases. Exhaust gas emission concentrations are heavily dependent on the concentration of biofuels used in the blend and the operating condition of the engine. The amount of PM decreases by mass and number when using ternary blends of diesel, biodiesel and ethanol in DICI diesel engine (Tse et al., 2015; Zhang and Balasubramanian, 2016). Whereas, due to higher oxygen content in biodiesel and ethanol, NO x emission from blended diesel is higher than pure diesel in most circumstance (EJ et al., 2017; Imdadul et al., 2016; Hosseini et al., 2017; Ghanbari et al., 2017). A reduction of NOx, HC, CO, and smoke emission by 9.2%, 6.7%, 5.9%, and 7.8%, respectively was reported through the combined effect of CNT nanoparticle neem biodiesel blending in diesel fuel. The experiment was conducted in a naturally aspirated single-cylinder, four-stroke diesel engine operated at 1500 rpm and varied engine loads (Ramakrishnan et al., 2019). A similar reduction of NOx, HC, CO, and smoke emission by 3,8%, 2.1%, 1.9% and 2.7%, respectively was reported with 100 ppm TiO2 is also utilized as a blend with Pongamia based biodiesel while the engine operated at full-loaded (Rangabashiam et al., 2019). Al2O3 mixed with B20 reduces all exhaust emission gasses, including HC and CO emissions by about 55% and 75%, respectively (Attia et al., 2014). That could be attributed to the effective mass transfer and improved radiation heat transfer properties (Tyagi et al., 2008; Krishnamurthy et al., 2006). Similarly, HC and CO emissions from DICI diesel engines are minimized by the addition of CuO, Rh2O3, CNT, Al@C, TiO 2, GO, graphene and ferrous fluids in biodiesel fuels (Wu et al., 2018; Srinivasa Rao and Anand, 2016; Yuvarajan et al., 2018; EL-Seesy et al., 2018; El-Seesy et al., 2018; Perumal and Ilangkumaran, 2018; Manibharathi et al., 2014). The addition of Al2O3 and CeO 2 in B20 reduces the emission of HC and CO, including all exhaust emission gases (Prabu, 2017). The case of simultaneous higher BSFC and higher CO emissions could be attributed to a large amount of low calorific value fuel admission into the cylinder and encounters incomplete combustion inside the cylinder. The concentration of HC in the exhaust emission release is usually because of incomplete combustion, poor flame propagation inside the combustion chamber, too lean or too rich air–fuel​ mixture, low mixture temperature or low injection pressure inside the engine cylinder (Anon, 2019). Usually, a DICI diesel engine with complete fuel oxidation in combustion chamber produces higher NO x as a result of higher combustion temperature (Qi et al., 2011). High pressure and temperatures in the cylinder due to improved oxygen amount of blended fuels and thermal mechanisms during the oxidation process makes the NO x release to increase (EJ et al., 2017; Zaharin et al., 2017). However, except with the use of Al2O3NPs with D70B20E10 blends, CNT NPs in B5 and B10, and TiO 2 in diesel–biodiesel–n-butanol​ blends (Hosseini et al., 2017; Örs et al., 2018; Venu and Madhavan, 2017) radical decrease of NO x is described with the application of NPs in DICI diesel engines (Srinivasa Rao and Anand, 2016; Hosseini et al., 2017; Attia et al., 2014; EL-Seesy et al., 2018; El-Seesy et al., 2018; Manibharathi et al., 2014; El-Seesy et al., 2017). The emission of NOx from JME fuels added with NPs in DICI diesel engine is low compared to neat JME biodiesel due to the effect of reduced ID (Suppes et al., 2001). Whereas, NO x concentration in the emission has increased with the addition of CNT into B5 and B10 substantially, and by addition of TiO 2 into diesel–biodiesel–n-butanol blend slightly (Hosseini et al., 2017; Örs et al., 2018). Complete burning and lesser exhaust emission can be achieved by improving the amount of oxygen in the mix (Anon, 2019). However, simultaneous reduction of all the exhaust release gases from DICI diesel engine is inconceivable as they are produced at various conditions. Some of them because of the high temperature amid burning. For example; HC and CO because of lower temperature and inadequate ignition of the fuel, and NO x because of excess oxygen and higher temperature inside the combustion chamber of the engine. The performance, combustion and emission characteristics of DICI diesel engine fuelled with diesel and blended diesel–biodiesel–ethanol fuels with NPs are affected by various factors such as; make and model of the test engine, fuel type, concentration ratios of constituent fuels in the blend (Saxena et al., 2017a; Venu and Madhavan, 2017), engine operating conditions, running cycles, testing methods, and instrumentations used. Despite all the benefits of using NPs for fuel modifications, combustion and efficiency enhancements, and exhaust emission reductions of DICI diesel engines, to some degree vague and inconsistent findings are found in the literature due to the above stated and many other reasons. Thus, further experimental investigations are necessary using different NPs to identify the best NPs to be used in DICI diesel engines, to estimate the proper dosage of NPs to be used for the anticipated performance enhancement and to identify the appropriate running conditions of the engine for better outcomes and to analyse many more NPs implications when used with DICI diesel engines as a fuel additive. Detail study could be gathered regarding the effect of nanoparticle addition as blend in diesel–biodiesel–ethanol blends on the performance, emissions and combustion. Detail literature review and the impact on the research progress is well discussed in this section. The role of the nanoparticles on the emissions, PM in particular, has not been studied to the nano-scale. Does the nanoparticle leave the cylinder along with the exhaust? If this is the case, what will be the effect of the nanoparticles on the environment and health-wise on humans? These questions are critical in the wide application of nanoparticles as biofuel blends. Carbon based nanoparticles are expected to burn along with the fuel. The major concern, however, is with the metal-based nanoparticles."
9,Conclusions,"The application of the current biofuel production technologies and nanotechnology together delivers steady and tolerant chemical reaction which can minimize unfriendly impacts of different solvents and catalysts utilized during biofuel generation; moreover, it can reduce biofuel’s cost of production. It is comprehended that most of the fuel properties can be enhanced by adding NPs. Thus, to determine the consequence of NPs utilization in DICI diesel engine performance, combustion and emission characteristics; critical selection of NPs and their best dosages are crucial. Furthermore, the physicochemical properties of the fuels used and their mixes have to be verified. Utilizing diesel fuel blended with biodiesel or both biodiesel and ethanol fuels in DICI diesel engines slightly reduce the BTE and Increases the BSFC. Though, the harmful exhaust emissions can be reduced considerably. Whereas, the use of NPs along with the diesel, biodiesel ethanol blends significantly increases BTE and substantially reduces BSFC. Besides, the harmful emission discharges such as HC, CO and PM can be reduced significantly. In most of the investigations piloted, the diesel engine performance enhances apparent with the NPs addition for most of the diesel, diesel–biodiesel and diesel–biodiesel–ethanol blends utilization in DICI diesel engines. A portion of the experiments demonstrated that increasing the concentration of NPs did not result in performance improvement equivalent to the proportions of NPs added. Thus, In order to find best performance enhancement effects, the main factor in choosing the ideal scope of NPs type, size and concentration ratio. Finally, using NPs in DICI diesel engine has the prospective to boost the performance and reduce the harmful exhaust emissions from the engine considerably."
