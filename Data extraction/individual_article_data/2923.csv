0,Introduction,"Recently, limited conventional energy resources as well as environmental issues persuade human societies move toward finding alternative energy sources and promote the energy efficiency of the systems [1–3]. Among different solutions, hydrogen is known as a clean energy carrier which is suitable for fuel cells systems. [4–6]. The application of hydrogen in fuel cells provides potentially higher efficiency compared to conventional internal combustion engines [7,8]. The fuel cell system emits nearly no harmful compounds such as CO2, NO x and SO x but faces storage and safety problems especially in automobiles [9]. This problem can be solved by in situ hydrogen production through the reforming of liquor hydrocarbons particularly alcohols [10,11]. Methanol due to its low cost and high safety is the most appealing in situ hydrogen production source [12]. The absence of strong CC bond in methanol, allows low temperature reforming (200–300°C), which is not possible for other fuels such as methane [13] (reforms above 500°C) or ethanol [14] (reforms around 400°C). Three traditional technologies are used to produce hydrogen from hydrocarbon fuels including steam reforming (SR), partial oxidation (PO), and autothermal reforming (ATR) [15–17]. Their main reactions will be represented as below: (R1) CH 3 OH + 0.5 O 2 = 2 H 2 + CO 2 Δ H ° = - 192 kJ / mol (R2) CH 3 OH + H 2 O = 3 H 2 + CO 2 Δ H ° = 50 kJ / mol (R3) CH 3 OH + ( 1 - 2 α ) H 2 O + α O 2 = CO 2 + ( 3 - 2 α ) H 2 Δ H ° = - 248 × 2 α + 50 kJ / mol Comparing two former methods, it can be found that partial oxidation (POM, R1) has rapid start-up [18] while produces lower amount of hydrogen (67%) and higher CO as by-product which is harmful for fuel cell anode catalyst [19]. On the other hand, steam reforming of methanol (SRM, R2) produces the highest hydrogen amount (75%) and low CO (<1%) due to the inhibiting role of water [18,20,21]. The auto thermal reforming of methanol is the combination of partial oxidation and steam reforming of methanol reactions and is known as an energy saving and fast start up reaction. In this reaction, overall heat of reaction depends on methanol to oxygen molar ratio, which also affects the concentration of produced hydrogen [19,22–24]. Among these, the steam reforming of methanol reaction is typically the preferred process for hydrogen production, since it yields high hydrogen amount relative to the other methods [25]. SRM catalysts are categorized into two main groups. First, copper based catalysts as the most common ones due to their high activity and selectivity [26]. These catalysts suffer from stability problems due to sintering of copper active sites at high temperatures. Second, 8–10 group catalysts which have been reported in the literature as highly stable active phases [27]. With respect to catalytic activity, the latter group has the drawback of producing less hydrogen in comparison with Cu-based catalysts. Copper containing catalysts are the most common ones, working at 240–260°C [23,28]. They are very active and low cost even though they originate a significant concentration of carbon monoxide, show low stability and have pyrophoric nature [29]. Catalytic deactivation can be then caused by sintering, coke formation, catalyst poisoning (chloride, sulfur) and change in oxidation state. Coke formation can be prevented using extra amount of water and generally, the best results are obtained for water/methanol molar ratio of 1.5:1 [30]. CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst is well known as commercial catalyst for SRM [31–33].Two approaches can be followed to modify Cu-based catalysts in order to produce more hydrogen and less carbon monoxide: (a) adding promoters [21,34] (b) changing/modifying the preparation method [35,36]. Although alumina weakens the SRM reaction, its small amount is necessary to provide mechanical stability of the catalyst and desired surface area. The optimum content for alumina is 10wt.% [31]. Therefore in this study, catalysts with different Cu, Zn, Ce loadings and fixed alumina loading (10wt.%) were synthesized to identify the promotional effect of ceria. Furthermore, urea-nitrate combustion as the novel synthesis method was applied for fabrication of these catalysts. The physicochemical properties of fabricated nanocatalysts were investigated by XRD, FESEM, PSD, EDX, TEM, BET, and FTIR techniques. Their catalytic performance was studied in a fixed bed reactor through the steam reforming of methanol."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Copper nitrate tri-hydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O), zinc nitrate tri-hydrate (Zn(NO3)2·3H2O), ceria nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O) and aluminium hydroxide (Al(OH)3) as nanocatalyst precursors and urea (CO(NH2)2) as combustion fuel, were supplied from Merck company. All of the reagents were used as their received forms without any further purification."
3,Nanocatalysts preparation and procedure,"2.2 Nanocatalysts preparation and procedure The CuO/ZnO/CeO2/Al2O3 nanocatalysts were synthesized by the urea-nitrate combustion method. The schematic procedure of preparation steps is illustrated in Fig. 1 . As shown, the preparation pathway of nanocatalysts consists 3 steps: (a) Precursor preparation. (b) Urea-nitrate combustion synthesis. (c) Nanocatalysts post treatment. At first step, Al(OH)3 was heated under air flow at 400°C and heating rate of 1–2°C/min for 4h to produce boehmite (AlOOH) as alumina source. Nitrate salts of copper, zinc and ceria and synthesized AlOOH with the selected ratios were solved in deionized water and mixed with appropriate amounts of urea (urea/nitrates=3mol/mol) for 45min. In the second step, the solution was preheated to 80°C to remove excess water and form viscous gel. The gel was introduced in an open muffle furnace maintaining at 400°C. The gel started frothing and foaming, after a short time ignition, along with rapid evolution of a large quantity of gases, resulting in a foamy combustion powder. In the last step, the obtained powder was calcined at 400°C for 3h under air flow to remove any remaining carbon residues and then shaped for loading in the reactor. The reliability of the synthesis procedure was ensured by keeping the amounts of produced catalyst constant. The synthesized nanocatalysts were labelled as CZCxA where C, Z, C, A denotes for CuO, ZnO, CeO2 and Al2O3, respectively, and x is the ceria weight percent."
4,Nanocatalysts characterization techniques,"2.3 Nanocatalysts characterization techniques The X-ray diffraction analysis was carried out by D5000 Siemens X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ =0.154056nm) with an X-ray tube operated at 30kV and 40mA in a scanning range of 2θ =15–90° with scanning rate of 0.02°/s to confirm the presence of metal oxide phases in synthesized nanocatalysts. The phase recognition was performed by comparison of resulted patterns with Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS). The average crystallite size and relative crystallinity was specified by XRD. The microstructure, morphology and combustion pores formed to remove combustion gases, were studied by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, HITACHI S-4160). Scanning electron microscope-energy dispersion X-ray (SEM-EDX) mapping for local elemental analysis was obtained by VEGA II-TESCAN equipped with BSE detector. To address the morphology of the samples, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was carried out using a Philips CM-200 electron microscope. Samples were ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol, then a drop of the suspension was put on a thin carbon film. The specific surface area of the nanocatalysts was measured by N2 physisorption at 77K on a Quantachrome ChemBET-3000 apparatus. To address surface functional groups, metal oxide groups and surface OH bounds, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, UNICAM 4600) was conducted over the wave number range of 400–4000cm−1 using KBr plate at room temperature."
5,Experimental setup for catalytic performance test,"2.4 Experimental setup for catalytic performance test The schematic diagram for the experimental setup, as shown in Fig. 2 , consists of a gas feeding section, a fixed bed reactor and the analysis section. Argon was utilized as a carrier gas and its flow was controlled by the means of mass flow controllers (MFC, Beijing Seven Star Electronics Co., Ltd.). It was passed through methanol/water mixture in a saturator container. Its flow rate was set on 70ml/min to provide the reactor feed with H2O/MeOH=1.5. The SRM reaction was carried out in a U-shape Pyrex tubular packed bed reactor (ID=8mm and length=32cm). It was loaded with 0.4g of nanocatalysts. Prior to the catalytic and stability tests, the nanocatalysts were reduced using hydrogen stream with a flow rate of 100ml/min at 300°C under atmospheric pressure for 3h. Catalytic performance was studied over the temperature range of 200–300°C in atmospheric pressure. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was set to 10,000cm3/gcat h. Reactants and products were analysed by means of on-line gas chromatography (GC Chrom, Teif Gostar Faraz, Iran) equipped with Plot-U Column (Agilent) as well as TCD and FID detectors. A methanizer reactor was connected prior to the FID detector to convert carbonaceous molecules (CO and CO2) to methane to be detectable. The conversion of methanol and selectivity of products were calculated as follows: (1) X CH 3 OH % = F CH 3 OH in - F CH 3 OH out F CH 3 OH in × 100 (2) S H 2 % = F H 2 out F H 2 out + F CO out + F CO 2 out × 100 (3) S CO % = F CO out F H 2 out + F CO out + F CO 2 out × 100 (4) S CO 2 % = F CO 2 out F H 2 out + F CO out + F CO 2 out × 100 where Fi is the flow rate of component i in the gaseous effluent."
6,Results and discussions,
7,Nanocatalysts characterization,"3.1 Nanocatalysts characterization 3.1.1 XRD analysis Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of CZCxA nanocatalysts with different ceria loadings prepared via the urea-nitrate combustion method. Diffraction peaks at 2θ =35.5°, 35.6°, 38.8°, 38.9°, 48.7°, 61.6° and 68.2° are attributed to monoclinic copper oxide crystallites (JCPDS: 01-080–1268). In addition, characteristic peaks at 2θ =31.7°, 34.4°, 36.2°, 47.5°, 56.5°, 62.8°, 67.9° and 69.0° as well as 2θ =28.8°, 33.2°, 47.7°, 56.6°, 59.4°, 69.8°, 77.1°, 79.5° and 88.9° determines the existence of hexagonal zinc oxide (JCPDS: 01-076–0704) and cubic cerium oxide (JCPDS: 01-075–0076) crystallites, respectively. It should be noted that as expected in all the XRD patterns of synthesized nanocatalysts, the absence of peaks of Al2O3 phase may be attributed to the fine dispersion, its coverage by other metal oxides and/or its formation in amorphous phase. Addition of ceria decreased the strength of sharp peaks of CuO and ZnO phases. This may be due to the enhancement of crystallites dispersion by increasing ceria content. Decrease in CuO peaks intensity with addition of ceria implies the increase in CuO dispersion of the nanocatalysts. Also, it can be seen that ZnO peaks fall down in CZC5A and CZC20A nanocatalysts. Crystallites size of metal oxides were calculated by Scherrer equation and reported in Table 1 . Addition of CeO2 decreased CuO and ZnO crystallites size which is in the range of 17–20nm. The XRD relative peak intensities at 2θs of 38.8 for CuO, 31.7 for ZnO and 28.8 for CeO2 are attributed to the relative crystallinity. It can be seen that CuO and ZnO relative crystallinity decreased from 100% to 48.5 and 43.8% for CuO and ZnO, respectively, whereas for ceria it increased from 30.8 to 100%. 3.1.2 FESEM analysis Morphological analysis of synthesized nanocatalysts is shown in Fig. 4 . This analysis depicts surface particle size distribution and surface properties of the synthesized samples. These images clearly reveal the porous structure of nanocatalysts resulting from the evolution of combustion gases. Using combustion method, beside the possibility to achieve nano-size uniform distribution of active phase, increases the pores facilitating accessibility of reactants to interior surface of the nanocatalysts. Combustion gases plays a significant role on the variation of crystallites size, relative crystallinity, controlling the particle growth and final morphology of the particles. The removal of combustion gases create pores on the nanocatalyst surface known as combustion pores. Combustion pores are classified into micro-pore and nano-pore based on their size. Particle agglomeration and cluster formations can be seen in Fig. 4a. Addition of ceria up to 10wt.% decreased particle size and made it more uniform. For the CZC20A sample, it can be seen that it has inverse effect on particle size. Due to the constant urea/nitrate ratio, with addition of ceria, urea content should be increased which resulted higher production of combustion gases. This phenomenon is favourable up to 10wt.% of ceria amount, afterwards it increases micropores and nanopores. 3.1.3 PSD analysis Further investigations were performed to study the particle size distribution (PSD) of synthesized samples. Particle size is an important parameter in coke formation. The results for CZC10A sample are presented in Fig. 5 . Particle size is distributed in the range of 11.9–54.2nm with standard deviation of 7.7. Nanocatalysts synthesized via urea-nitrate combustion method have uniform particle size distribution; So that more than 95% of particles are below 40nm, and of those, over 77% are in the range of 20–35nm. The average particle size is reported 28.3nm. Beside nanostructured catalyst, highly porous powder can also be achieved by applying the combustion synthesis method. 3.1.4 TEM analysis Fig. 6 illustrates TEM images of the CZC10A sample prepared by the urea-nitrates combustion method. Most of the particles are in spherical form as the most proper morphology to ensure proper reactivity properties. TEM images prove the nanometric structure of the CZC10A nanocatalyst with no agglomerates. Good interactions between copper and zinc species can be detected from TEM micrographs. These appropriate properties can promise the suitable catalytic activity of this sample through the steam reforming of methanol process. 3.1.5 EDX analysis The EDX dot-mapping analysis of the CZC10A nanocatalyst is illustrated in Fig. 7 . The nanocatalyst composition is close to the primary gel composition which proves no material loss was happened during synthesis method. All the elements used in the preparation steps of the nanocatalyst, which some of them were not detected by XRD patterns such as aluminium, can be seen in EDX analysis. This analysis shows uniform dispersion of the elements (Cu, Zn, Ce and Al) especially the active copper species in CZC10A nanocatalyst. Furthermore, no sintering or particle growth on the surface can be seen. 3.1.6 BET analysis The surface areas of synthesized nanocatalysts are given in Table 1. As expected the surface areas of the combustion synthesized samples are low. It should be noted that, addition of promoter did not affect surface area significantly. 3.1.7 FTIR analysis Fig. 8 shows the FTIR spectra of CZC0A, CZC5A, CZC10A and CZC20A nanocatalysts in the range of 400–4000cm−1. Generally, peaks in the 400–675cm−1 range are related to metal-O bonds. The peaks of all samples in this range can be observed with proper intensity. In details, the peak at 512cm−1 corresponds to the presence of ZnO. The OCuO bond causes appearance of peaks at about 500 and 1384cm−1. In addition, peak near 582cm−1 introduced the alumina presence. Some tiny peaks in the range of 1000 to 3500cm−1 can be designated to surface adsorption of H2O and CO2 which exists in the sample structure between layers [37–39]. The peaks around 3300–3500cm−1 is related to OH bond [40–42]. Peaks around 1225 and 1740cm−1 correspond to adsorbed CO2 [43–45]. As mentioned above the Al2O3 presence in samples can be proved by FTIR which was not observed in XRD patterns [46]."
8,Reaction mechanism of nanocatalysts formation,"3.2 Reaction mechanism of nanocatalysts formation The urea- nitrates combustion synthesis method is known as a novel, fast and simple method for fabrication of metal oxide nanocomposites and subsequently nanocatalysts. The basis of the combustion synthesis technique comes from the thermochemical concepts used in the field of propellants and explosives [47]. Fuels used in this method serves two purposes [48]: (a) It releases heat, CO2 and H2O gases as a source of C and H. (b) It facilities homogeneous mixing of the cations in the solution by formation of complexes with the metal ions. During evaporating the excess water of nitrate solution of metals to form the primary gel, urea as the combustion fuel decomposes in two stages. It decomposes into ammonia and water to keep the pH of the solution constant. The second dissociation occurs while heating the gel where urea finally converts to HCNO. But if excess amount of urea is introduced, such as the samples synthesized in this paper, it would be reacted and produced C2H5N3O2, through the following reaction: (R4) CO ( NH 2 ) 2 → HCNO → C 2 H 5 N 3 O 2 Along with the mentioned urea decomposition, metal nitrate salts decomposes to Me(OH)x and HNO3: (R5) Me ( NO 3 ) x + x H 2 O → Me ( OH ) x + xHNO 3 Then ions produced from metal oxides as below; prevent hydroxide group precipitation: (R6) Me ( OH ) x + x C 2 H 5 N 3 O 2 → Me ( C 2 H 5 N 3 O 2 ) x + + x OH - Then using the heat released from fuel (urea) combustion, the following reaction takes place: (R7) CO ( NH 2 ) 2 + 1.5 O 2 → CO 2 + 2 H 2 O + N 2 Δ H ° = - 129.9 kcal / mol Desired compounds are obtained and the overall reaction is as following: (R8) Cu ( NO 3 ) 3 + Zn ( NO 3 ) 3 + Ce ( NO 3 ) 3 + ( 17 / 3 ) CO ( NH 2 ) 2 → CuO + ZnO + CeO 2 + ( 55 / 6 ) N 2 + ( 17 / 3 ) CO 2 + ( 34 / 3 ) H 2 O"
9,Catalytic performance study toward methanol steam reforming,"3.3 Catalytic performance study toward methanol steam reforming 3.3.1 Methanol conversion Fig. 9 illustrates the catalytic performance of fabricated nanocatalysts for conversion of methanol to products. As it can be addressed by thermodynamics of the reaction, increasing temperature will result increase of methanol conversion. At low temperatures, the sample with no ceria loading shows minimum conversion. Higher conversion for the nanocatalyst with 10wt.% of ceria loading is evident, which has dropped by increasing of ceria loading from 10 to 20wt.% in CZC20A nanocatalysts. This is indicating that there is an optimum value for ceria loading in CZA nanocatalysts. As mentioned in XRD interpretation, CeO2 improves dispersion of CuO and ZnO. Also, it has unique redox properties which improve the reducibility of CuO. Generally, addition of CeO2 to an optimum ratio improves the SRM reaction and its further addition lowers the efficiency of the nanocatalyst. FESEM images showed that, addition of ceria up to 10wt.% has favourable effect. Uniform particle size, increase in nanopores and decrease in micropores are some of the useful effects. However, introducing higher amount of ceria disrupted the nanocatalyst structure. So, in this study 10wt.% CeO2 is introduced as the optimum content. 3.3.2 Products selectivity The products of SRM reaction are H2, CO2 and CO, while CO is an undesired product which is generated by a side reaction called reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS). As stated previously, CO can poison the anodic catalyst of the fuel cells as well as affecting negatively the permeation of Pd-based membrane reactors [49]. So, hydrogen rich feed to the PEMFC fuel cells should have minimum CO impurity. The products selectivity of synthesized nanocatalysts is depicted in Figs. 10–12 . CZC10A nanocatalyst illustrates the best performance in product selectivity. It shows the minimum ratio for undesired products and maximum selectivity toward desired product in whole temperature ranges. CO selectivity of CZC10A is zero up to 260°C. The sample with 10wt.% ceria has the best performance and the favorable temperature range for this nanocatalyst is 260–280°C. 3.3.3 Time on stream performance Time on stream study of the CZC10A nanocatalyst for methanol steam reforming reaction was evaluated at 260°C, atmospheric pressure, GHSV=10,000cm3/gcat h and H2O/MeOH=1.5 and its result is depicted in Fig. 13 . The stability study was performed for 1600min. Life time study showed that the catalyst with 10wt.% CeO2 has suitable performance in terms of methanol conversion and CO production. Low surface area is gained via the combustion synthesis method, but the foam structured nanocatalyst eases the access to the interior parts. Long-term time on stream performance of CZC10A nanocatalyst can be addressed by its physicochemical characterizations including structure and morphology. These appropriate characteristics lead to enhancement of methanol conversion, suitable product distribution and reduction of carbon deposition."
10,Reaction mechanism of methanol steam reforming,"3.4 Reaction mechanism of methanol steam reforming In this section, possible reaction pathways for the formation of hydrogen via steam reforming of methanol over CeO2-promoted CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 nanocatalyst is studied and illustrated in Fig. 14 . In Table 2 all the reactions involved in overall network are summarised. Species with (∗) superscript denote the intermediates adsorbed on surface, while ones with (S) subscript show species which are adsorbed on molecular state. CeO2 is applied in this research because of its unique redox properties. A catalytic cycle is formed in Cu/CeO2 interface involving 4 steps [50]: (a) Methanol and water as reactants adsorbed on Cu/CeO2 interface. (b) The surface reaction and desorption of gaseous products. (c) Surface oxygen migrates from CeO2 to reduced Cu (oxygen reverse spill over). (d) The regeneration of partially oxidized copper and oxygen vacancies. SRM starts through methanol and water adsorption and dissociation. Studies showed that dissociative adsorption of methanol on Cu(100) and Cu(110) form methoxy species (CH3O). It is offered that absorbed O on catalyst surface increases the formation of methoxy groups [51,52]. It should be noted that source of O sites could be the transitory O remained on Cu surface because of incomplete reduction. However, Fischer and Bell [53] suggested that it could be supplied by moisture present in the feed [54], noting that H2O dissociation over reduced polycrystalline has been seen at temperatures as low as 73°C [55]. Hydrogen pretreatment also favours the formation of oxygen vacancies and the decrease of the oxidation state of copper clusters [50]. Based on two distinct active sites proposed for the SRM reaction, methoxy species could undergo two pathways. Both of reaction pathways ending to formate (CHOO) formation [56]. In the methanol adsorption analysis, aside methoxy species, formate is one of the most common intermediates. Different reaction channels toward formation of formate proposed including Cannizzaro reaction of formaldehyde (CHHO) [57] and dehydrogenation of dioxymethylene species (CH2OO) [53]. The oxidation of dioxymethylene into formate and hydroxyl has also been seen [58]. Again as mentioned above, based on two type of reaction active site, formate could undergo two different reaction channels. It could dissociate into CO and OH, in which CO reacts with surface O and gives CO2 or directly formate dissociates into CO2 and surface H site. Reaction between H∗ gives H2, as main product. As Cu-based catalysts are also active for reversible water gas shift reaction, CO2 reacts to CO through reverse water gas shift reaction. Boudouard reaction produces coke as catalyst deactivating agent. For all reactions in reaction network, specific heat, enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy are provided as temperature functions in the form of least-square coefficients [59]: (1) H T ° RT = ∫ C P ° dT RT = a 1 + a 2 T 2 + a 3 T 2 3 + a 4 T 3 4 + a 5 T 4 5 + a 6 T (2) S T ° R = ∫ C P ° RT dT = a 1 ln T + a 2 T + a 3 T 2 2 + a 4 T 3 3 + a 5 T 4 4 + a 7 (3) G T ° RT = H T ° RT - S T ° R = a 1 ( 1 - ln T ) + a 2 T 2 - a 3 T 2 6 - a 4 T 3 12 - a 5 T 4 20 + a 6 T - a 7 It should be noted that the H T ° is different to the H T ° - H T ° ( ref ) function, but it is defined as: (4) H T ° = Δ H f ° ( T ) + ∫ 298 T C P ° ( T ) dT So that H T ° / RT , S T ° / R and G T ° / RT values calculated from the polynomial equations can be directly used to compute standard properties of species and reactions."
11,Conclusions,"Nanostructured CuO/ZnO/CeO2/Al2O3 catalyst was successfully prepared by the combustion synthesis method. Physicochemical characterizations show that CeO2 made CuO and ZnO crystallites more dispersed and it slightly reduced crystallinity. Catalytic performance study also proved that the catalyst with 10wt.% CeO2 had higher methanol conversion and selectivity toward H2. Also, it produced less amount CO as the undesired product due to its harmful effect on fuel cell systems. Life time study also showed that the catalyst with 10wt.% CeO2 has suitable stability. The urea nitrate combustion method as a simple, fast and cost effective method presented as an appropriate method, producing mixed oxide nanocatalysts."
