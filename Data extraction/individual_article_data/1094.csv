4,Results and discussion,
5,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization 3.1.1 Thermal analyses Aminomethylphosphine-Ru(II) and Ni(II) complexes supported on Fe3O4@SiO2 nanocomposite behaved the similar thermogravimetric properties as seen in Figure S1. All the complexes showed four endothermic degradation bands in TG/DTA/DTG curves. Firstly, the adsorbed water molecules were desorbed from the ambient temperature to 90 °C. The dissociation of silanol groups and chloro ligands degraded to about 300 °C with an endothermic band. Aminophosphine and p-cyemene ligands having aromatic and the aliphatic substituents decomposed to over 600 °C with an endothermic band. The last band was due to the formation of metal-oxides. The total degradations of the complexes were 15–20%. Fe3O4, SiO2, and metal-oxide derivatives have arisen after the temperature program. 3.1.2 Morphology Non-uniform spherical structures were observed in TEM and SEM images of Fe3O4-supported aminomethylphosphine-Ru(II) and Ni(II) complexes. It can be said that silica was covered on the spherical magnetite particles. The diameter of the supported complexes on the spherical particles have about 10 nm (Fig. 3 ). The diameter of Fe3O4@SiO2@L3-Ni(II) complex particle calculated as 6.14 nm ± 0.75 nm for Fe3O4@SiO2@L3-Ni(II) (Fig. 4 ). 3.1.3 EDX The EDX spectra of the synthesized Fe3O4@SiO2@aminomethylphosphine-Ru(II) and Ni(II) complexes were confirmed the complexation on the nanocomposite surface having phosphorus, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, iron, silicon, chlorine and the metal for each complex. (Figure S2). 3.1.4 XRD analyses In order to study the crystalline structural properties and phase information of the synthesized Fe3O4@SiO2 based aminomethylphosphine-metal complexes, X-Ray diffraction analyses were conducted. The XRD patterns for Fe3O4, Fe3O4@SiO2, Fe3O4@SiO2@L3-Ru(II) and Fe3O4@SiO2@L3-Ni(II) were given in Fig. 4. The graphic explicitly demonstrates both the crystalline and amorphous structures formation. The highest crystalline structures obtained for Fe3O4 nano-particles with obvious six peaks at around 2θ angle of 30.10°, 35.42°, 43.12°, 53.65°, 56.96° and 62.52 correspondings to the (220), (311), (400), (422), (511) and (440) crystal planes of the Fe3O4 (Ref. Code. 01–075–1610, PDF2 database) similarly also found in recent literature [46,47]. In the illumination of the XRD results, the cubic structure of Fe3O4 nanoparticles is synthesized. The crystalline size of the nanoparticles was found by utilizing the Scherrer formula determined as 44.3 nm. There is also a small peak around 44.67 related to the cubic form of iron (Ref. Code: 01–087–0721). The bottom lines demonstrate the reference card bars of Fe3O4 and Fe with red and black color, respectively. The XRD pattern of Fe3O4@SiO2 nanocomposite decreases the intensity of Fe3O4 diffraction pattern that indicates the existence of the disordered structure of Fe3O4@SiO2 nano-particles [48]. The diffraction pattern of Fe3O4@SiO2@L3-Ni(II) composite is given in green in Fig. 5 , with introducing aminomethylphosphine-Ni(II) complex to Fe3O4@SiO2 composites, the pattern slightly changed. The most apparent peak centered at 44.67° indicates iron phase. Also, for Fe3O4@SiO2-L3-Ru(II) complex, the crystalline peak at 44.67° and 64.98° represents the existence of iron phase. 3.1.5 Optical absorption analyses The metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) transitions of the complexes were observed at around 360 nm due to the π-acidity of phosphorus-carbon σ * − antibonding orbitals in aminomethylphosphine ligands in the metal complexes. Thus, these type of the ligands are known as σ-donors and strong π-acceptors [23,49,50]. MLCT transfer bands were seen in UV spectra of Fe3O4@SiO2@bis(diphenylphosphinomethyl)amine-Ni(II) and Ru(II) complexes. Besides, the forbidden d-d-d transitions of the complexes were recorded at around 485 nm as very small bands [23, 49, 50]. 3.1.6 FT-IR The band gap of the synthesized nanocomposites was calculated by using the Tauc equation; ( A h v ) n = B ( h v − E g ) here, E g is optical band gap of the composites, hv is the photon energy, B is material constant, A is the amount of absorbance and n is constant depends on the material. The selected UV–Vis. spectra and the calculated band gaps of all the synthesized complexes were given in Fig. 6 and Fig. S3. The graphics of band gap energies of the synthesized nanoparticles under the light of the above mentioned studies were plotted as seen Fig. S3 [51-55]. The band gap values of Fe3O4 were reported as 2.04 eV in the literature [56], but in our study, we found band gap of Fe3O4 as 2.08 eV. The band gap increased by introducing SiO2 to 2.31 eV was found in this study. The calculated band gaps were given in Figure S2 and band gap values for Fe3O4@SiO2@L1-Ni(II) and Fe3O4@SiO2@L4-Ru(II) was calculated as 2.37 eV and 2.38 eV respectively. 3.1.6 FT-IR spectra Silica peaks from the covering on the magnetite in the complexes were impressed to the vibration modes of the functional groups in FT-IR spectra. The silanol-OH and secondary amine NH stretching modes of the magnetite@SiO2 supported aminomethylphosphine-metal complexes were overlapped with a wide band at about 3100–3400 cm−1. Aromatic and aliphatic CH stretching modes were recorded at around 3000–2890 cm−1. Aromatic C = C stretching mode was seen at around 1620 cm−1. The wideband around 1060 cm−1 was because of Si-O asymmetric stretching modes. P-Ph and C-N stretch of the supported aminomethylphosphine-metal complexes were collected as one broad peak at about 1400 cm−1. Besides, M-P and M-Cl vibration modes of the complexes were collected about 530 cm−1and 430 cm−1 in FT-IR spectra of the complexes (Table 1 and Figure S4)."
6,Catalytic synthesis of D-Sorbitol by d-Glucose transfer hydrogenation: aldose reductase mimetics,"3.2 Catalytic synthesis of D-Sorbitol by d-Glucose transfer hydrogenation: aldose reductase mimetics The novel synthesized nanocomposite supported, magnetically recoverable aminomethylphosphine-Ru(II) and Ni(II) complexes were used in the transfer hydrogenation of d-glucose to D-sorbitol in isopropyl alcohol under microwave power in 1 h reaction time. Isopropyl alcohol (i-PrOH) is used as a solvent and hydrogen source in the transfer hydrogenation reactions, which is cheap, safe, nontoxic, environmentally friendly [57]. All the novel Ru(II) complexes showed outstanding catalytic activities, especially Fe3O4@SiO2@L2-Ru(II) complex was the best at 97.18% selectivity with 99.11% conversion when compared to the literature in the route of the transfer hydrogenation of d-glucose to D-sorbitol [36,37,40,58-63]. Fe3O4@SiO2@L2 Ni(II) complex was also very active in the transfer hydrogenation of d-glucose to D-sorbitol over 68.89% selectivity with 97.15% conversions (Fig. 8, 9, Table 2 ) (chromatograms given in each catalyst in supplementary as separate pdf files). According to the possible catalytic reaction mechanism (Fig. 7 ) and the literature, catalysis is very important for the transfer hydrogenation of d-glucose to D-sorbitol working as a brain in the reaction. The high selectivities can be obtained by using a catalyst in the transfer hydrogenation [36,37,40,58-63]. The nano-core magnetite (Fe3O4) is a unique supporting material because of its large area and its magnetic properties for the silica gel's controlly precipitation. In addition, covering of SiO2 on a nano-core provides additional vital features because of its unique chemically and physically stability in severe chemical and physical conditions for the catalyst supporting. Ru(II) complexes of aminomethylphosphine ligands supported on Fe3O4@SiO2 calculated small band gap like a semiconductor (Figure S3) gives unique properties in the transfer hydrogenation of d-glucose to D-sorbitol due to the electron transfer from i-PrOH (reducing agent) to metal center and finally to the substrate in the possible mechanism. In addition, nanocomposite supported complexes having about 2.0–2.5 eV band gaps supply an easy electron circulation from the substrates to the reducing agent (i-PrOH). Also, the effect of the microwave excitation to the bonds provides a large positively charged surface area for the binding of substrates and the reducing agents with a complexation in the reaction possible mechanism (Fig. 10 ). Aminomethylphosphine ligands have excellent steric and electronic properties that can increase the catalytic transfer hydrogenation activity because of having π-back bonding properties in the metal complexes. π-acceptor aminomethylphosphine ligands can form π-back bonding with metal centers, and they can play unique catalytic activities in the catalysis mechanism. Because the strong π-back bonding in the complex can facilitate the leaving of chloro and p-cymene ligands, and then formed d-glucose-Ru(II)-aminomethylphosphine-(i-PrOH) pre-complexes in the effect of K2CO3 base. In the activated Ru(II) complexes, having coordinated the sugar substrate and the reducing agent can easily change the molecular structure of the chelated metal-ligand complexes in the proposed catalysis mechanism. The hydrogen transfer from i-PrOH to the carbonyl group of glucose in the coordination sphere can be formed and then acetone and D-sorbitol leaves from the metal center (Fig. 5) [6,16,34,35,57,59,64,17-23,33]. The microwave power in the closed reactor system increased D-sorbitol selectivity with Ru(II) catalyst while controlling the oxidizing to gluconolactone and rearrangement and isomerization of d-glucose to d-mannitol and d-fructose in the transfer hydrogenation reaction mechanism like a processor. Additionally, the microwave irradiation in the closed system provided the bond activation of sugar having dipole fields with the homogeneous heating resulted in the transfer of hydrogen from isopropyl alcohol to d-glucose efficiently. Thus, it was obtained 97.18% selectivities with 99.11% conversions that is the best in the literature [35,38,40,58,62,63,65]. The Ru (II) complexes were removed from the reaction medium with a magnet and washing after each analysis, and re-usability was examined in the cycles. The Ru(II) complexes, which have the highest recovery in five cycles, especially Fe3O4@ SiO2@L2-Ru (II) complex (Table 3 , Fig. 11 )."
