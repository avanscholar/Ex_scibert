0,Introduction,"The catalytic transformation of CO2, which is an abundant, nontoxic, and industrial exhaust carbon source [1–4], to various valuable fuels and chemical feedstocks (such as light olefins, carbonates, formic acid, and alcohols) [5–11] is highly attractive owing to significant global warming and other environmental issues. Among these, ethanol is a fundamental chemical product, as an important solvent, an industrial building block, and a promising renewable fuel [12,13]. Direct CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol is a particularly attractive and promising route for ethanol production and hydrogen storage in the carbon-neutral perspective [6,14,15]. However, there remain major challenges such as the activation of CO2 and high CH4 selectivity [16,17]. Therefore, CC coupling needs to be enhanced to further improve ethanol selectivity. Most research on direct CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol is focused on noble-metal catalysts [14,15,18,19], owing to their outstanding ability to activate CO2/H2 and catalyze CC coupling. For example, Rh/SiO2 catalysts promoted by Li [20] and Fe [21] have been employed with ethanol selectivity of 15.5% and 16.4% at 240 °C, respectively. Ordered Pd–Cu nanoparticles have been fabricated as efficient catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol, with selectivity up to 92.0% at 200 °C [15]. Pt/Co3O4 catalyst showed excellent selectivity for C2–C4 alcohols at 140 °C [14]. Considering the cost and scarcity of noble metals, inexpensive and abundant non-noble-metal-based catalysts seem a better choice for industrial applications. K/Cu–Zn–Fe oxides could achieve 19.5% selectivity of ethanol at 300 °C and 7 MPa pressure of CO2 and H2 in a fixed-bed reactor [22]. Subsequently, the CoMoS based catalyst has been shown to produce 5.5% ethanol at 340 °C and 10.4 MPa [18]. The harsh conditions (high temperature and pressure) and low product selectivity are still obstacles to the reaction in a fixed-bed reactor. Further, several catalytic systems could achieve excellent selectivity for ethanol in an autoclave reactor under mild conditions. For example, Cu/Mo2C catalysts could acquire 14% ethanol selectivity at 200 °C. CoAlO x catalysts give 92.1% ethanol selectivity at 140 °C. It is worth noting that Cu- and Cs-functionalized MOF produced ethanol with >99% selectivity and a turnover number of 490 mol/mol at 100 °C [23]. However, the low CO2 conversion and catalytic stability in the autoclave reactor limit the industrial application of non-noble metals. Therefore, more efficient and selective non-noble-metal catalysts under milder conditions in fixed-bed reactors remain highly desirable. In recent years, transition metal carbides have received much attention due to properties similar to those of noble metals in the production of oxygenates. For example, a simple β-Mo2C catalyst could produce 1% ethanol through CO2 hydrogenation [24]. A Co2C/SiO2 catalyst generated alcohols with up to 65.6% selectivity under conditions of 220 °C, 3 MPa, and H2/CO = 1/1 [25]. Remarkably, in our previous work, the CoMn–CuZnAlZr catalyst was proved to achieve oxygenates with selectivity up to 58.1% from syngas and to promote CC coupling by the formation of Co2C [26]. Furthermore, a Na-promoted Co-based catalyst has been shown to be highly selective in higher alcohols. Davis et al. [27] showed that the presence of Na in the Co/SiO2 catalyst could promote the stability of Co2C during Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS), and the selectivity for alcohols increased to 73.2%. We also certified that a Na promoter favored the formation of Co2C and acted as an electronic donor to enhance CO adsorption and dissociation on the CoMn catalyst in FTS. After Na doping, the olefin selectivity of C2-4 = increased from 15.4% to 52.4% [26,28,29]. Therefore, Na-promoted Co2C was beneficial for high oxygenate selectivity, owing to its excellent ability to absorb CO and catalyze CC coupling. Unfortunately, the conventional Co2C phase usually suffers from instability under H2 above 220 °C, which diminishes its long-term performance [30–33]. Here, a series of Na-promoted cobalt catalysts, Na–Co/X (X = Al2O3, ZnO, SiO2, AC, Si3N4, and TiO2), have been prepared and employed in direct CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol. The influences of supports on the formation and stability of Co2C during reduction and reaction were investigated in detail through XRD, TPX-MS, XPS, Raman, and in situ characterization. They indicated that Co2C anchored with SiO2 and Si3N4 achieved high selectivity and 300 h long-term stability, which was attributed to the strong interaction between Co2C and supports, as well as CO-induced regeneration and reconstruction of Co2C during reaction. Finally, in situ DRIFTS characterization validated that CO derived from the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) inserted into CH x intermediates to generate ethanol over Co2C."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation A series of Na-promoted Co-based catalysts with different supports were prepared through the incipient wetness impregnation method. An aqueous solution of cobalt nitrate (Co (NO3)2·6H2O, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.) and an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.) were sequentially added dropwise to supports, i.e., SiO2 (Aladdin, 99.9%), γ-Al2O3 (Sasol), ZnO (Nanjing XFNANO Materials Tech Co.), Si3N4 (Alfa, α-phase, 95%), TiO2 (P25 Evonik Industry, 80% anatase and 20% rutile), and AC (activated carbon; Brilliant Tech Co.). All catalysts had the same Co and Na loadings of 20 and 2 wt%, respectively. The AC support was pretreated to remove impurities by stirring it in a 25% HNO3 solution at 80 °C for 2 h and washing several times with deionized water until neutralization. All catalysts were dried overnight at 60 °C after each impregnation step followed by calcination at 350 °C for 4 h in static air (the catalyst on AC was calcined under a nitrogen flow)."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The concentrations of Na and Co were obtained with an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Optima 8000, PerkinElmer). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) at 40 kV and 40 mA in a scanning angle (2θ) range of 5°–90°. In situ XRD patterns were measured on the same instrument with an in situ chamber for reduction and reaction. Catalysts were reduced in a flow of CO (50 ml/min) and XRD patterns were recorded at temperatures ranging from 30 to 450 °C (5 °C/min) with 100 °C as an interval. The reaction process was simulated using reduced catalysts at 250 °C in a flow of H2/CO2 (3/1; 50 ml/min). Each scan was performed every 1 h for 2θ ranging from 5° to 90°. The morphology of samples was measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on a JEOL-JEM 2011 electron microscope (200 kV). The samples were prepared using ultrasound dispersion in ethanol and taking one droplet of suspension dropped on a carbon-coated copper grid. Nitrogen adsorption measurements were carried out on a TriStar II 3020 instrument. About 100 mg of a sample was outgassed at 200 °C under vacuum for 10 h followed by nitrogen adsorption–desorption experiments at 77 K. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation was used to calculate the specific surface area, and the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method was used to determine the total pore volume and the average pore size. H2 (or CO) temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were conducted on a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 instrument equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and an MKS Cirrus 2 mass spectrometer. Samples of 50 mg were first purged with Ar at a flow rate of 60 ml/min at 200 °C for 2 h and then cooled down to 50 °C. H2 TPR (or CO TPR) was then conducted under H2 (or CO) by raising the temperature from 50 to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C /min. For H2 TPD, about 100 mg of reduced catalysts was calcined at 200 °C for 2 h in a flow of Ar. After cooling to 50 °C, the catalysts were flushed with 10% H2/N2 (50 ml/min) for 2 h. Then the gas was switched to Ar to remove the physically adsorbed H2 for 1 h. The program was performed from 50 to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha spectrometer using AlKα radiation (150 W, hν = 1486.6 eV) under ultrahigh vacuum (5 × 10–7 bar). The C1s spectra of all catalysts were calibrated at 284.8 eV. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIRS) experiments were carried out on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet Is10 spectrometer. Before measurement in static air, the samples were mixed with KBr, ground, tableted, and dried (minimizing the interference of adsorbed H2O in the air). The spectra were collected in an infrared cell from 400 to 4000 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1 and an accumulation of 32 scans. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFS) measurements were carried out on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet 6700 spectrometer. A powder sample (30 mg, without KBr) was placed directly in the in situ cell with a ZnSe window and pretreated at 250 °C for 20 min with an Ar flow of 20 ml/min, and then the background spectrum of the sample was collected from 650 to 4000 cm−1. CO2 (20 ml/min), H2/CO2 (3/1, 20 ml/min), CO (20 ml/min), and H2/CO (2/1, 20 ml/min) was introduced into the cell, respectively. After holding for 30 min (recorded every 10 min), the temperature was increased from 250 to 300 °C and the spectra were recorded. Raman spectra were measured on a Thermo Scientific DXR 2xi Raman Microscope with an EMCCD detector and a 514 nm Ar ion laser. In situ Raman spectra were collected with the same equipment. The samples were tested at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 310 °C in flows of H2/CO2 (3/1) and H2, respectively, using a laser power of 2.0 mW, a scanning time of 0.2 s, and 200 scans."
4,Catalytic evaluation,"2.3 Catalytic evaluation CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol reactions were conducted in a stainless fixed-bed reactor (inner diameter 8 mm). In this experiment, 1.5-ml catalysts (40–60 mesh) and 3 ml quartz sand diluent (40–60 mesh) were mixed and then placed in the middle of the reactor. The inert quartz sand was large crystalline particles as distinguished from the amorphous nano-SiO2 that we used as supports. The catalyst was reduced by pure CO under the condition of 2000 h−1 gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) prior to the reaction. The reduction process was first carried out at 180 °C and 0.5 MPa for 5 h, and then the temperature was increased to 250 °C for 5 h at a heating rate of 1 °C/min, and finally held at 300 °C for 5 h. After reduction, the temperature was cooled to 180 °C and the feed flow was switched to a mixture of H2, N2, and CO2 (N2/H2/CO2 = 3/72.4/24.6, 3 vol% of N2 as the internal standard, 4000 h−1). Afterward, the reaction was tested at 250 °C and 5 MPa. The products were collected every 20 h during the reaction. The reactor effluent was analyzed online by two Shimadzu GC-2014C gas chromatographs. One was equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) using a TDX-01 column to analyze H2, N2, CH4, CO, and CO2; the other was equipped with a hydrogen flame ionization detector (FID) using a modified alumina-packed column to analyze C1–C7 hydrocarbons. The liquid products were analyzed offline on the same chromatograph equipped with TCD and FID (two Porapak Q columns). The CO2 conversion was calculated on a carbon atom basis by the equation C O 2 C o n v e r s i o n = n C O 2 i n - n C O 2 o u t n C O 2 i n × 100 % where n C O 2 i n and n C O 2 o u t are the numbers of moles of CO2 at the inlet and outlet, respectively. CO was produced from the reverse water gas shift reaction and the selectivity was calculated according to the equation C O S e l e c t i v i t y = n C O o u t n C O 2 i n - n C O 2 o u t × 100 % where n C O o u t represent the numbers of moles of CO at the outlet. The selectivity for individual hydrocarbon or oxygenate products Si was calculated following the equation S i = C i × n i ∑ ( C i × n i ) × 100 % where C i indicates the molar fraction of product i (hydrocarbon or oxygenate), and ni is the carbon number of product i."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalytic performance,"3.1 Catalytic performance Amphoteric Al2O3 (acidity and alkalinity), ZnO and TiO2 with oxygen vacancies, AC with large specific surface area, and inert SiO2 and Si3N4 were used as supports to investigate performance in CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol. The catalysts reduced by pure CO at 300 °C were tested at 250 °C, 5 MPa, and H2/CO2 = 3/1, and the catalytic performance is listed in Table 1 . The CO2 conversion for the catalysts supported on Al2O3, ZnO, AC, and TiO2 was much higher than that on those supported on SiO2 and Si3N4. However, methane dominated among products, with low CO selectivity and alcohol selectivity (<1%). In striking contrast, the catalysts supported on SiO2 and Si3N4 exhibited superior total alcohol selectivity of 9%, and ethanol dominated in alcohols at 62%. The CO selectivity was up to around 30% and the CH n selectivity decreased significantly to around 60%. Notably, Na–Co/SiO2 exhibited excellent catalytic stability in terms of CO2 conversion and ethanol selectivity during 300 h evaluation (Fig. 1 and Table S1 in the Supporting Information). The distinctive performance among those catalysts reveals that supports have a significant impact."
7,Correlation between performance and cobalt species,"3.2 Correlation between performance and cobalt species To reveal structure–performance relations for these Co-based catalysts with various supports, XRD characterizations were employed to determine the phases of the calcined, reduced, and spent catalysts. As shown in Fig. 2 a, all catalysts exhibited diffraction peaks after calcination at 31.3°, 36.8°, and 65.2° (2θ, JCPDS card PDF#43-1003), which can be assigned to the Co3O4 phase. In Fig. 2b, obvious discrepancies can be noted after reduction. All Co3O4 on ZnO was reduced to CoO. The cobalt phases on Al2O3 consisted mainly of CoO (2θ = 36.5°, 42.4°, and 61.5°, PDF#43-1004) with minor unreduced Co3O4. Notably, Co2C (2θ = 41.5°,43.0°, and 45.9°, PDF#50-1371) and CoO coexisted on the other four supports (AC, TiO2, SiO2, Si3N4). In addition, hcp Co (hexagonal close-packed cobalt; 2θ = 41.7°, 44.8°, 47.6°, PDF#05-0727) could be observed on AC. Fig. 2c demonstrated the variations of catalysts after reaction. The CoO phase in ZnO and Al2O3 was reduced by hydrogen to hcp Co. All Co2C on AC and TiO2 was also decomposed to hcp Co after reaction. To our surprise, the CoO phase on SiO2 and Si3N4 disappeared and transformed into the Co2C phase. TEM images in Fig. 3 confirmed similar variation of cobalt phases (see Figs. S1 and S2 for details). Only CoO (0 0 2) appeared on Al2O3 and ZnO after reduction. Co2C could be observed simultaneously on other supports after reduction, in which the (1 1 1) facet was the dominant crystal plane. Previous reports have indicated that Co2C (1 1 1) is beneficial for the formation of alcohol [34]. However, Co2C (1 1 1) could be observed merely on SiO2 and Si3N4 supports after reaction, while the cobalt phases on other supports were almost transformed into hcp Co (1 0 1). Based on these characterization results, Co2C failed to form on Al2O3 and ZnO supports after reduction. Although Co2C could form on AC, TiO2, SiO2, and Si3N4 supports after reduction, it only remained stable on SiO2 and Si3N4 after reaction. Combining the catalytic performance with the evolution of corresponding cobalt phases, we draw the tentative conclusion that Co2C might be the active phase in CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol, while high CO2 conversion and CH n selectivity were attributed to the formation of metallic Co. In addition, the possibility that CoO contributed to the generation of ethanol was excluded (Fig. S3). Therefore, ethanol generation was closely associated with Co2C, whose formation and stability depended on supports."
8,Effects of supports on the formation of Co2C,"3.3 Effects of supports on the formation of Co2C Various methods of characterization were employed to investigate support effects on the formation of Co2C. First, the textural properties of calcined catalysts were tabulated in Table S2. The particle size of Co3O4 followed the sequence Si3N4 > ZnO > TiO2 > SiO2 > Al2O3 > AC, and the specific surface area was reversed. It was concluded that the particle size and dispersion of Co3O4 did not affect the formation of cobalt carbide. In situ XRD was carried out to reveal the reduction processes (Fig. 4 ). Three sequential steps could be involved: (1) The Co3O4 phase would first be reduced to CoO from room temperature to 250 °C. (2) CoO would be further converted to Co2C at 300 °C. (3) If the temperature was raised above 400 °C, Co2C would be partly decomposed to hcp Co. The steps were thus (1) Co3O4+ CO → 3CoO + CO2 (2) 2CoO + 4CO → Co2C + 3CO2 (3) Co2C + 4CO → 2Co + 2CO2 + 3C It can be inferred from Fig. 4 that Na–Co/Al2O3 and Na–Co/ZnO could only undergo step (1) under identical reduction conditions. In contrast, other catalysts would readily go through step (2). Therefore, only Al2O3 and ZnO mainly supported CoO, which failed to be further carbonized to Co2C. A similar conclusion could be drawn from CO TPR profiles as shown in Fig. 5 . All catalysts exhibited a minor signal peak at 180–300 °C, which corresponded to the partial reduction of Co3O4 to CoO (Step 1). The large peak centered at 279–360 °C was attributed to the reduction of most Co3O4 to CoO and CoO to Co2C (Step 2). The broad peak above 400 °C might be assigned to the decomposition of Co2C (Step 3). It was obvious that the second reduction temperature (Step 2) on Na–Co/Al2O3 (360 °C) and Na–Co/ZnO (344 °C) was higher than other catalysts. Thus, they could only be reduced to CoO. Ruling out the effects of particle size and dispersion, the difficulty of the formation of cobalt carbides was probably the result of the existence of cobalt aluminate species [35] and oxygen defects [36] on Al2O3 and ZnO, respectively. XPS characterization of calcined catalysts was conducted to determine the electronic properties of cobalt species on supports (see Fig. 6 ). From the Co2p spectra, the binding energies of Co2p 3/2 for all catalysts were in the range from 779 to 781 eV, which corresponded to Co3O4. The lower binding energies of Co2p 3/2 on Na–Co/Al2O3 and Na–Co/ZnO than on other catalysts suggest that they had higher electron density, and charge transfer from Al2O3/ZnO supports to cobalt oxide was proved. The results hindered the reduction of Co3O4, corresponding to the previous TPR results. The above analyses also indirectly illustrate that cobalt aluminate species on Al2O3 and oxygen defects on ZnO may exist. In short, the discrepancy in the degree of reduction was attributed to the difference in interaction form between cobalt precursors (or Co2+) and supports during calcination."
9,Effects of supports on the stability of Co2C,"3.4 Effects of supports on the stability of Co2C As shown above, although the Co2C active phase could form on AC, TiO2, SiO2, and Si3N4 after reduction, Co2C was almost completely decomposed on AC and TiO2 during reaction. The unsupported Na–Co3O4 catalyst was prepared to verify the effects of support. Part of Co2C was also converted to hcp Co after reaction under identical conditions (Fig. S4), resulting in higher CHn selectivity (Table S3). Therefore, supports could remarkably affect the stability of Co2C. We used AC, TiO2, SiO2, and Si3N4 (all of which could form Co2C during reduction) to discern how supports affected the stability of Co2C during reaction. The textural properties of reduced and spent catalysts were tabulated in Table S4 and S5. The particle size of Co2C on reduced Na–Co/TiO2 and Na–Co/AC catalysts were smaller than on the others, which probably rendered Co2C readily decomposed. The morphology and structure of Co2C were identified using TEM characterization (Figs. S1 and S2), which showed irregular shapes on four supports. This suggested that the effects of morphology and structure are not the main reason for the stability of Co2C. To obtain direct evidence of Co2C variation over supports, the dynamic processes were monitored using in situ XRD. As shown in Fig. 7 , Co2C on reduced Na-Co/AC and Na-Co/TiO2 remained intact at room temperature under Ar. However, raising temperature to 250 °C and switching Ar to CO2/H2 led to the rapid decomposition of Co2C to hcp Co. The decomposition rate of Co2C on AC (1 h) was higher than that on TiO2 (6 h). Moreover, Co2C was directly reduced by H2 instead of initially oxidized by CO2 or H2O [37]. In contrast, Co2C on Na–Co/SiO2 and Na–Co/Si3N4 exhibited excellent stability. As shown in Fig. S5, cobalt phases of Na–Co/SiO2 consisted of pure Co2C after 100 h reaction. When reaction time was prolonged to 300 h, the peak intensity of Co2C increased, which indicated enhancement of the crystallinity of Co2C. TEM images in Fig. S6 further verified the crystalline structure of the cobalt phase after the reaction. All lattice fringes were assigned to the crystal phases of Co2C. Based on these results, it was speculated that the stability of Co2C could be attributed to strong metal–support interaction (SMSI). H2 TPR-MS and H2 TPD-MS experiments were carried out to further validate the SMSI. Co2C formed on four catalysts after reduction was reacted with H2, and CH4 formation signals during the H2 TPR process are given in Fig. 8 . Na–Co/SiO2 exhibited two reduction peaks at 210 and 348 °C. Similarly, two reduction peaks at 233 and 390 °C were detected on Na–Co/Si3N4. In contrast, Na–Co/TiO2 and Na–Co/AC showed only one reduction peak at 190 °C (The broad peak in the range 400–700 °C on Na–Co/AC was attributed to the hydrogenation of the AC support [42]). For all the catalysts, the peak below 300 °C was attributed to Co2C decomposition (Co2C hydrogenation) [25,32]. From these results, we concluded that Co2C on TiO2 and AC was completely decomposed under actual reaction conditions (250 °C and H2 atmosphere), which could be ascribed to its weak interaction with supports. In contrast, partial Co2C on Na–Co/SiO2 and Na–Co/Si3N4 was not decomposed until above 348 °C, which was associated with their excellent stability under reaction conditions. We believe this was due to the strong interaction between Co2C and SiO2/Si3N4. The H2 TPD profiles of reduced catalysts further validated the interaction. As shown in Fig. 9 , both H2 and CH4 signal peaks (at around 300 °C) existed on reduced NaCo/SiO2 and NaCo/Si3N4. However, only two CH4 signal peaks (at 250 and 400 °C) could be detected for Na–Co/TiO2 and Na–Co/AC. CH4 and H2 signals represented the decomposition of Co2C by H2 and the desorption of H2 on Co2C, respectively. These results indicate that a significant amount of Co2C remained on SiO2 and Si3N4 supports to absorb H2, while Co2C was totally decomposed on TiO2 and AC and unable to absorb H2, which again illustrated the interaction between Co2C and supports. In addition, the significant signal of H2O in H2 TPR-MS (Fig. S7) and FTIRS (Fig. S8) showed that more hydroxyl groups existed on Na–Co/TiO2 and Na–Co/AC, which might weaken the interaction between metal and supports. However, Co2C was still unstable during the reaction after removal of surface hydroxyl groups on AC supports (Fig. S9 and Table S6). Therefore, the form of the interaction was not affected by hydroxyl groups on the supports. To further reveal the reason for the formation of interactions, XPS analysis was conducted and the results are given in Fig. 10 . As shown in Fig. 10a, the Co2p XPS spectra of all reduced catalysts showed Co2+ (the peak at around 781.2 eV) [38], which could be attributed to Co2C and CoO (the specific values of Co2p 3/2 peaks are compiled in Table S7). Notably, the binding energy of the 2p3/2 electron on Na–Co/SiO2 and Na–Co/Si3N4 shifted to higher energy (0.2–0.4 eV) than on Na-Co/TiO2 and Na-Co/AC, which indicated that Co2+ on SiO2 and Si3N4 supports had more electronic defects and the electrons transfer could occur more readily [39]. C1s XPS spectra also showed identical surface electron properties (Fig. 10b). Deconvolutions of the C1s peaks of reduced catalysts were located at 283.2, 284.8, 285.9, and 287.2 eV, which were assigned to CoC, CH, CO, and CO bonds, respectively [40–42]. The CoC binding energies of NaCo/SiO2 and NaCo/Si3N4 were 0.3–0.4 eV lower than the others, suggesting higher electron density and a more stable CoC bond. These results indicated the interaction might be due to the electron effects. Based on the above-mentioned electron effects on NaCo/SiO2 and NaCo/Si3N4, we paid more attention to the surface electron properties of SiO2 and Si3N4 supports to further elucidate the relationship between electron effects and interaction. The obtained spectra of O1s and Si2p are given in Fig. 11 and specific binding energies are listed in Table S8 and S9. As seen in Fig. 11a and b, the O1s XPS spectra of pure SiO2 and Si3N4 showed two peaks at around 530.6 and 533.4 eV, which can be assigned to the oxygen defect and lattice oxygen (OSiO), respectively [43,44]. Similar peaks were observed on the reduced and spent NaCo/SiO2 and NaCo/Si3N4 (the peak at around 534.0 eV was associated with the surface-adsorbed oxygen or hydroxyl groups). However, the binding energy of lattice oxygen on Co2C-supported catalysts (NaCo/SiO2 and NaCo/Si3N4) shifted to lower energy compared to pure SiO2/Si3N4. Si2p XPS spectra also showed similar results in Fig. 11c and d. The peaks of 101.3 and 103.5 eV for the pure SiO2 were attributed to the SiO x (Si3+ or Si2+) [44,45] and OSiO (Si4+) [43,46], respectively. The peaks of 99.3, 101.5, and 103.4 eV for Si3N4 were assigned to SiN x , SiN (Si3N4), and SiO bonds, respectively [47–50]. The binding energies of OSiO (or SiO) on reduced and spent catalysts shifted to lower energy. This evidence illustrated that SiO2 and Si3N4 loaded with Co2C obtained higher electron density than its original state. As mentioned above, the higher electron density of the SiO bond signified that more electrons have been seized by supports. Considering that Co2+ possessed more electron defects and the SiO bonds of supports had higher electron density, it can be concluded that electrons transferred from Co2+ to supports and stable SiOCo chemical bonds formed on NaCo/SiO2 and NaCo/Si3N4, which strengthened the CoC bond and further stabilized Co2C during reaction. Raman spectroscopy of reduced catalysts was carried out to further investigate the chemical environment of Co2C on different supports. As shown in Fig. 12 , two peaks in the ranges 1342–1376 and 1586–1602 cm−1 were respectively attributed to the D and G bands of C in Co2C, which were observed on the four catalysts. The D band originated from an A1g vibration mode of carbon atoms’ in-plane terminations in disordered graphite [51,52], and the G band was assigned to the E2g mode of graphitic carbon. The I D/I G (the integrated intensity ratio of these two bands calculated according to the peak area) could reveal the disorder degree of defects on Co2C [53], which were 1.36, 1.39, 1.81, and 2.00 (ca.) for reduced NaCo/SiO2, NaCo/Si3N4, NaCo/TiO2, and Na–Co/AC catalysts, respectively. The I D/I G values on SiO2 and Si3N4 were lower than that on TiO2 and AC, suggesting that Co2C on SiO2 and Si3N4 possessed lower disorder degree of defects, which rendered the surface energy of Co2C low. In addition, the obvious redshift of D band occurred on SiO2 and Si3N4 compared with TiO2 and AC supports, which was ascribed to the weakened vibration energy of chemical bonds on SiO2 and Si3N4 supports [54]. These results further demonstrated that the chemical environment of Co2C was different on the four supports, and it was more stable on SiO2 and Si3N4 due to the formation of SiOCo bonds."
10,Mechanism for CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol on Co2C,"3.5 Mechanism for CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol on Co2C In situ DRIFTS of reduced NaCo/SiO2 catalysts was conducted to further determine the reaction path of CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol on the Co2C active phase. As shown in Fig. 13 a, the reduced Na–Co/SiO2 catalyst was first exposed to CO2 at 250 °C. A broad absorption band at 1070–1340 cm−1 was attributed to carboxylate (CO2 δ−) and bidentate carbonate (CO3 2−) [15]. The band at 1340–1600 cm−1 corresponded to unidentate carbonate (υ(OCO)) [35]. When CO2 was removed by Ar and a mixture of CO2 and H2 (H2/CO2 = 3/1) was introduced, obvious sharp peaks at 1261 cm−1 and 1425 cm−1 appeared in 30 min, which were associated with the adsorption band of CO3 2−. New peaks at 1340 and 1595 cm−1 were attributed to formate species (HCOO−). The peak at 1458 cm−1 was related to OCO stretching [55–57]. The υ (CH) vibration mode of CH4 was located at ca. 3014 cm−1. It was worth mentioning that the trace peaks at 1965 and 2110 cm−1 were assigned to linear chemisorbed CO and gas-phase CO on Co2C [58], respectively, which implied that the RWGS occurred in our catalytic system. The adsorbed formyl species (CHO*), which were intermediates in the formation of ethanol, centered at 1740 cm−1 [59,60]. Notably, the intensity of peaks at 1070, 2863, and 2946 cm−1, which were assigned to unsaturated CH (CH x *) species or methoxy (CH3O*) [15,26,56,61], increased with rising temperature from 250 to 300 °C. Because CO and CH x * were observed simultaneously in our experiment, we speculated that absorbed CO (CO*) first generated through RWGS was hydrogenated to CH x *, followed by the insertion of CO* and final hydrogenation to ethanol. To verify the path, the DRIFTS measurements were performed under a mixture of CO and H2 in Fig. 13b. CO was first introduced at 250 °C. Two bands at 2112 and 2176 cm−1 corresponding to gas-phase CO adsorption could be observed. With removal of CO and switching to syngas (H2/CO = 2/1), the peaks resembled those in CO2 hydrogenation, which appeared within 30 min at 250 °C. The peaks at 1740 cm−1 were attributed to CHO*, and the peaks at 1087, 2863, and 2927 cm−1 corresponded to CH x * or CH3O*. The linear chemisorbed CO was centered at 1938 cm−1. The intensity of these peaks increased as the temperature rose. Briefly, these reaction intermediates of CO2 hydrogenation were identical to those in CO hydrogenation. The results confirmed that the catalytic mechanism for both reaction was analogous, including an identical and essential step, insertion of CO* into CH x *. Based on the above analysis, we further proposed that reaction-induced evolution of Co2C on SiO2 and Si3N4 supports might occur. As shown in the previous H2 TPR-MS and H2 TPD-MS, Co2C could also be partially decomposed on SiO2 and Si3N4 supports below 250 °C under H2, but metallic Co was not observed through XRD, TEM, or XPS (Fig. S10) after the reaction. We speculated that although the surface Co2C might be decomposed to metallic Co due to the absence of interaction with supports, they could regenerate and reconstruct by CO induction during reaction. The reconstruction could be proved indirectly through a range of characterizations. For example, the XRD diffraction peak intensities of Co2C on SiO2 and Si3N4 noticeably increased after reaction (Fig. 2c and Fig. S5), which corresponded to the strengthened crystallinity. It was obvious that Co2C redistributed over the reaction in TEM images (Fig. 3 and Fig. S11). In addition, the BET area, pore volume, pore size, and particle size of Co2C definitely changed after the reaction from those before the reaction (Table S10). What is more, the binding energy of Co2p 3/2 rose slightly (Fig. S12) and the binding energy of the Si–O bond dropped somewhat (Table S8 and S9) after the reaction, which suggested enhanced interaction. These phenomena indicated that the surface structure of Co2C on supports varied after the reaction. More importantly, the reconstruction originated from the regeneration of Co2C from metallic Co. Although the surface Co2C might be decomposed to metallic Co during the reaction, the interior Co2C interacting with the supports could produce CO through RWGS to carbonize metallic Co. The CO-induced metallic Co reconstruction to form Co2C has already been demonstrated [62]. We also indirectly observed the regeneration of surface Co2C by in situ Raman characterization (Fig. S13). Therefore, new Co2C might be continuously generated and reconstructed on SiO2 and Si3N4 supports in our results (Scheme 1 ). Some newly formed surface Co2C could migrate to supports to form the SMSI, which finally became more stable. The decomposition and formation of Co2C would reach dynamic equilibrium, ensuring the excellent stability and ethanol selectivity on Co2C during reaction."
11,Conclusions,"Na–Co-based catalysts on various supports (Al2O3, ZnO, AC, TiO2, SiO2, and Si3N4) have been prepared and investigated for direct CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol. Utilizing SiO2 and Si3N4 as supports, the catalysts showed excellent performance, with 18% CO2 conversion and 62.8% ethanol selectivity in the alcohol distribution, with up to 300 h stability. The improved performance was due to the existence of stable Co2C during the reaction. The stability of Co2C originated from strong metal–support interaction (SMSI) formed by the SiOCo bond. Mechanism studies demonstrated that ethanol was generated by the insertion of CO produced from RWGS into CH x intermediates on Co2C. Meanwhile, the decomposed surface Co2C could be continuously regenerated and reconstructed by CO induction to achieve long-term stability. We believe that rational and sophisticated design for cobalt carbide catalysts on this basis will further improve the catalytic performance of CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol and make industrial applications possible."
