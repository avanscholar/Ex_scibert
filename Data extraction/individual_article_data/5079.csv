0,Introduction,"Furfuryl alcohol (FOL) is an industrial chemical used primarily in binders for foundry sands in the production of cores and molds in metalworking [1]. Furfuryl alcohol can be produced by hydrogenation of furfural (FAL) in the gas phase over a copper chromite catalyst. Furfural itself can be produced sustainably from agricultural wastes such as corn cobs, bagasse, etc. Thus furfuryl alcohol and other furfural derivatives can be considered to be environmentally friendly, sustainable chemicals. Conceptual flowsheets for the furfural alcohol process with vapor phase reaction have been published [1,2], however no detailed modeling studies of this process are available in the literature to our knowledge. That is the purpose of this contribution. Section 2 of this article describes the assumptions employed in the modeling. Section 3 reports the results of the steady-state design and optimization. Section 4 reports the results of the dynamic modeling and control. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 5."
1,Process model,
2,Reactions and kinetics,"2.1 Reactions and kinetics The desired reaction is the hydrogenation of furfural: Furfural + H2 → Furfuryl alchohol Further hydrogenation of furfuryl alcohol produces the undesired byproduct 2-methyl furan: Furfuryl alcohol + H2 → 2-methyl furan + H2O Although the desired reaction is theoretically reversible, the equilibrium constant permits conversion greater than 99% at standard operating conditions and therefore many of the kinetic models published in the literature approximate the reaction as irreversible. Several authors have studied the hydrogenation of furfural and reported kinetic data and/or kinetic models for the reaction [3–19]. A variety of different types of catalysts have been investigated for the reaction, including copper chromite, copper/sodium silicate and platinum catalysts. Copper chromite is the most widely used catalyst in the industry [2] and offers good yield and high selectivity to furfural alcohol with 2-methyl furan and water being the only significant byproduct. Therefore, in this work, the kinetics reported by Borts et al. [3] using a copper chromite catalyst are employed: r FOL = 3.14 × 10 16 exp ( − 10 , 740 T ) C FAL C H 2 2 where the concentration of reactants C FAL and C H 2 are in mol/L and the temperature T is in Kelvin. Borts et al. do not provide data or a kinetic model for the rate of the undesired reaction. However, information about the production of 2-methylfuran at 99% conversion of furfural and at different temperatures is provided by Zeitch [2]. These data were used to regress parameters of a kinetic rate expression for the second reaction. The result is: r 2 - MF = 1.41 × 10 20 exp ( − 19 , 000 T ) C FOL C H 2 where temperature and concentration have the same units as for the desired reaction. As with any industrial process, small quantities of other chemicals in addition to furfural alcohol, methylfuran and water may be formed in the reactor. Possible additional byproducts include tetrahydrofurfural alcohol, 1,2- and 1,5-pentanediol and n-amyl alcohol. However, if a copper chromite catalyst is used these byproducts are expected to be produced in sufficiently small amounts that they do not significantly affect the process."
3,Thermodynamics,2.2 Thermodynamics The NRTL model with the Hayden–O'Connell correlation was used to model the vapor–liquid equilibrium in the simulation. The source of binary interaction parameters is given in Table 1. The predicted temperature and composition of stationary points at 0.2 bar is given in Table 2. Values are provided at a reduced pressure because the distillation column discussed later is designed at a lower pressure. Furfural alcohol and water form an azeotrope at atmospheric pressure but the azeotrope is not present at reduced pressure [23]. The binary T–xy diagrams for all pairs of species except those with hydrogen are given in Fig. 1. The numerical values of the NRTL binary interaction parameters are given in Table 3.
4,Process design and optimization,"The process flowsheet is shown in Fig. 2 . Because high conversion and high yield of the desired product can be achieved in the reactor, the design of the reactor and separation system do not affect each other significantly and therefore they can be designed separately. Therefore they are discussed separately in this section."
5,Reactor design,"3.1 Reactor design The reactor was modeled using the RPlug block in Aspen Plus. The material and energy balance equations were solved assuming perfect mixing in the radial direction and no mixing in the axial direction. Coolant temperature was assumed to be constant and heat transfer between the reactor tubes and the coolant was described by an overall heat transfer coefficient. The reaction rate was converted to a reactor volume basis using an assumed catalyst density of 1.2 g/cm3. The pressure drop in the reactor was calculated using the Ergun equation. The feed to the reactor is assumed to be hydrogen that is nearly saturated with furfural vapor at the reactor inlet temperature and pressure (135 °C and 1.1 bar). The feed ratio of hydrogen to furfural at the reactor inlet was considered as a design variable, and the total annual cost of the process as a function of that molar ratio is shown in Fig. 3 . Although a higher ratio favors the reaction, it also results in an increase in the recycle ratio of hydrogen and the associated compression costs, which dominates the economics. A lower bound on the ratio is necessary to ensure that all species remain in the gas phase as the reaction proceeds at atmospheric pressure. An amount of furfural slightly less than the saturation concentration was employed to ensure that all species remained in the vapor phase in the reactor. The molar ratio of hydrogen to furfural at the reactor inlet was set to 3.28. The most important consideration in the reactor design is to ensure that adequate area is available for heat transfer to absorb the heat of reaction and maintain stable reactor operation. In this design catalyst is diluted with inert packing to reduce the specific reaction rate and prevent the reactor from overheating. A catalyst pellet size of 1 cm and a tube inner diameter of 3 cm are assumed, the latter value being the smallest value that was thought to be reasonable, in order to maximize the surface are for heat transfer. Given the importance of removing the heat of reaction, the overall heat transfer coefficient between the reactor contents and the cooling medium is a critical parameter. The overall heat transfer coefficient U was calculated using the method described by Harriott [24]. The overall resistance to heat transfer can be expressed as a sum of resistances in parallel: (1) 1 U = 1 h j + r wall + 1 h w + 1 h bed where 1/h j, r wall 1/h w, and 1/h bed are the resistances to heat transfer in the jacket, the metal wall, the gas film at the wall, and the catalyst bed. Among these, the greatest resistance to mass transfer is in the gas film, and the film heat transfer coefficient is estimated from the following correlation: (2) N u w = 1.94 R e p 0.5 P r 0.33 Harriott also presents an expression for the critical temperature difference between the reactor and the jacket, ΔT c. This is the maximum allowable temperature difference between the reactor and the jacket. (3) Δ T c = R T max 2 E where T max is the maximum temperature in the reactor. To provide a good margin of safety and controllability, it is desirable that the maximum difference between the reactor and the jacket be less than half of the critical temperature difference. The reader is referred to the book by Harriot for a derivation of Eq. (3) and a discussion of the applicability of this method. The procedure for the design of the reactor then is as follows: 1. The coolant temperature was set to 140 °C based on a description of the process in the literature [2]. 2. The tube diameter was set to 3 cm, the smallest value that was thought to be reasonable, to provide maximum area for heat transfer. 3. A value for the catalyst dilution factor was specified. 4. The number of tubes and the length of each tube were determined to achieve 99% conversion of furfural with a reasonable overall reactor aspect ratio. 5. The maximum temperature difference between the reactor and jacket was determined. If the value was >10 °C, the catalyst dilution factor was increased and the procedure was repeated from step 3. The resulting temperature and composition profile in the reactor are shown in Fig. 4. Table 4 shows the resulting reactor properties."
6,Distillation column design,"3.2 Distillation column design The process requires a single distillation column to separate the product furfural alcohol from the unconsumed furfural and the byproducts water and 2-methylfuran. It is advantageous to operate the column at reduced pressure because the relative volatility between furfural and furfural alcohol is larger at lower pressure. The top column pressure was set at 0.2 atm so that cooling water could be used to cool the distillate. The column bottom composition was set at 99.2% furfural alcohol by adjusting the bottom flowrate, and the mole fraction of furfural alcohol in the top product was set to 1% by adjusting the reflux ratio. The remaining design degrees of freedom were the number of stages and the feed stage. These variables were adjusted iteratively to find the column design with the lowest total annual cost. The total annual cost of the process as a function of the number of stages and the feed stage is shown in Fig. 5. The complete column design is shown in Table 5. The process stream is shown in Table 6."
7,Economics,"3.3 Economics A breakdown of the total annual cost is given in Table 7. The total annual cost is calculated assuming a payback period of 3 years. Other equations used in calculating the capital and operating costs are given in the Appendix. The total annual cost of the process is estimated to be $831,000/year. In order to estimate the cost associated with loss of raw materials due to selectivity losses, purge losses and incomplete conversion, it was necessary to include a cost for furfural and hydrogen in the economic calculations. The costs of hydrogen, furfural and the catalyst used in this work are $1/kg, $1000/ton and $100/kg respectively. The total annual cost as a function of the cost of furfural is shown in Fig. 6. The profit of the process (the difference between the value of the raw materials and the products) is not included in the economic calculations because the results would be very sensitive to this price differential. Instead a process design is sought which produces a specified amount of product with the minimum cost."
8,Process dynamics and control,"Dynamic simulations were conducted in Aspen Dynamics to test the operability and control of the proposed process. Fig. 7 shows the proposed control structure. The recycle flow rate of hydrogen is manipulated to maintain the desired ratio of hydrogen to furfural at the reactor inlet, and the fresh feed of hydrogen is manipulated to maintain the pressure in the hydrogen recycle line. A reactor effluent composition controller is used to maintain the desired conversion in the reactor by adjusting the reactor temperature setpoint in the case of production rate changes or catalyst deactivation. In the distillation column it was found that single-point composition control was adequate to maintain product purity and avoid excessive loss of raw materials from the top of the column. Fig. 8 shows the temperature sensitivity diagram for a change in the reboiler duty. The diagram indicates that the first stage (the reboiler) is the most suitable stage for temperature control. Fig. 9 shows the response of the process to a production rate change. The responses are nearly symmetric. The reactor temperature changes as desired to achieve nearly 99% conversion of furfural. The column bottom temperature returns to the setpoint within about 10 h. The bottom composition changes slowly but remains well above the product purity specification (99%) at all times. The column top flowrate of furfural alcohol remains small. Fig. 10 shows the response of the process to a change in the composition of water in the furfural feed. Again the response is nearly symmetric and the product purity remains within the specification at all times. If the water content increases, the production rate of furfural alcohol decreases and vice versa because there is less furfural available to convert to product. Fig. 11 shows the response of the process to a deactivation of the catalyst. Reactor coolant temperature is raised up to about 150 °C within about 10 h. The desired 99% conversion of furfural is still achieved after 50% catalyst deactivation. The column responses are fast and the product purity also remains above specification. Fig. 12 shows the reactor temperature profile at base case and after catalyst deactivation with and without control of the reactor effluent composition. Compared with the base case, the highest temperature in the reactor is about 8 °C cooler after deactivation if no composition control is employed. If composition control is employed, the composition controller raises the reactor temperature so that the peak temperature is about 12° higher than the base case in order to achieve the same conversion with reduced catalyst activity. Although single-point temperature control was found to be satisfactory for the column, for completeness single-point composition control was investigated as well. The dynamic responses of column variables (top furfural alcohol flow rate and bottom composition) are shown in Fig. 13 . The column performance was satisfactory but generally slower than for temperature control, particularly at the top of the column, where in some cases the flow rate of furfural alcohol in the distillate required >100 h to reach steady state. (All variables did reach steady state eventually.)"
9,Conclusions,"The design and control of a process to produce furfuryl alcohol has been studied. Simulations indicate that the process is capable of producing furfuryl alcohol with the desired purity. The total annual cost of a process to produce 50 kmol/h of furfural alcohol is $831,000/year. Control studies indicate that the process can be controlled and can reject disturbances while maintaining the desired product purity at all times. The process can be utilized in the production of valuable chemicals from agricultural waste.w"
