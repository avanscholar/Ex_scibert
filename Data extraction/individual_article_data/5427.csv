0,Introduction,"Many possibilities exist for practical applications of light-sensitive semiconductor materials in the technologies of photocatalytic gas-phase and liquid-phase neutralization of environmental pollutants [1–4], the production of molecular hydrogen from water and water-alcohol solutions [5], in photopolymerization [6], and synthesis of organic compounds [7]. For these purposes improving the functional characteristics of semiconductor photocatalysts is essential. Typically, traditional semiconductors that absorb UV light (TiO2, ZnO, ZnS) were used to carry out the reactions mentioned above. Examples of inorganic semiconductors successfully operating visible light are limited, mainly, to modified titanium dioxide (sensitization by ruthenium complexes or dyes, nitrogen or sulfur doping, metal nanoparticles coating) [8–10], or nanostructures containing toxic metals (e.g. cadmium selenide and sulfide or mixed zinc cadmium sulfides) [11]. The main disadvantages of the used photocatalytic processes are low quantum yields, low sensitivity to visible light, and the use of toxic elements. Recently, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has attracted the attention of researchers [12–14] due to the capability to partially absorb visible light. The band gap of carbon nitride varies from 1.9 to 2.7 eV, depending on the methods of synthesis and can be tuned by subsequent modification. The potential of the conduction band (ECB) varies from −0.75 to −1.53 V and the potential of the valence band (EVB) varies from 1.03 to 1.9 V, compared to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) at pH 7 [13]. These basic values allow g-C3N4 to take part in the reaction of photocatalytic water splitting to hydrogen and oxygen. In addition, g-C3N4 has a high heat resistance and is stable upon treatment with acids and alkalis. Unlike metal-containing photocatalysts requiring expensive metal precursors, g-C3N4 can be easily obtained by thermal polycondensation of cheap bulk chemicals (e.g. melamine, urea). However, this material is not devoid of several disadvantages: a relatively small surface area, relatively low concentration of active centers, and low mobility of photogenerated charges leading to their poor separation and rapid recombination [12]. In this regard, various approaches are proposed to improve the physical and chemical characteristics of g-C3N4, in particular, creating a composite with other materials on its basis [15–19], doping [20–24], spatial organization [25], and exfoliation [26–28]. The effect of post-synthesis thermal treatment of the initial bulk g-C3N4 in molten salts was studied to obtain crystalline graphitic carbon nitride (CGCN) [29–32], which exhibits significantly higher activity, in particular, in the photocatalytic production of molecular hydrogen. However, this procedure implies the use of expensive inert gases. This significantly limits the possibility to scale up the synthesis of CGCN and sophisticates the selection of optimal synthesis parameters. The aim of this work is to study in a systematic way the effects of temperature and duration of pyrolysis of melamine on the production of bulk graphite carbon nitride, as well as the effect of an additional heat treatment of synthesized g-C3N4 in the melt of LiCl + KCl salts in the presence of the air on the physical and chemical properties as well as the photocatalytic activity of the resulting crystalline carbon nitride in the reaction of molecular hydrogen evolution from aqueous solutions of electron-donor substrates."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials In this work, commercially available melamine (Aldrich, 99% purity), KCl (ACROS Organics, 99+% purity), LiCl (Merck, ≥99 % purity), lactic acid (Aldrich, 85%, FCC purity), ethyl alcohol (Himlaborreaktyv, chem. pure), were used without additional purification."
3,Synthesis of graphitic carbon nitride and crystalline graphitic carbon nitride,"2.2 Synthesis of graphitic carbon nitride and crystalline graphitic carbon nitride Bulk graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was synthesized by calcining melamine for 4 h at a temperature of 500 °C in the presence of air [29]. The resulting product was cooled to room temperature, grounded in an agate mortar to a powdered state, and stored at room temperature in the dark. Crystalline graphitic carbon nitride (CGCN) was prepared according to [29] based on the pre-synthesized g-C3N4. In the typical procedure, 0.6 g g-C3N4, 3.3 g KCl and 2.7 g LiCl were thoroughly grounded in a ball mill to a homogeneous mass. The mixture was placed into a glass flask, heated in a muffle furnace to 550 °C, and calcined at that temperature for 4 h in the presence of air (sample CGCN (Air)), or by blowing the reaction mixture with an argon stream with a flow rate of 1 L/min (sample CGCN (1)) or 2 L/min (sample CGCN (2)). Then, the resulting mass was cooled to room temperature, dispersed in distilled water and carefully stirred until the salts completely dissolved. The slurry was further centrifuged at 5000 rpm to separate the supernatant from the obtained material. This procedure was repeated several times for the complete removal of the salts. Finally, the product was washed several times with ethanol, separated by centrifugation and dried in air at 60 °C. In addition, to elucidate the effect of the temperature and duration of melamine pyrolysis on the photocatalytic activity of crystalline carbon nitride, two series of samples were prepared. In the first one, the melamine calcination temperature (TC) was varied in the range of 400−650 °C at a fixed pyrolysis time of 4 h. In the second one, the pyrolysis duration was varied in the range of 0.5−6 h at TC = 500 °C. The resulting samples were further subjected to thermal aerobic treatment in the molten salts using the method described above."
4,Characterization methods,"2.3 Characterization methods Diffractograms of the samples were recorded using an X-ray diffractometer DRON-3 M (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 0.1540 nm). Diffuse reflection spectra in the ultraviolet and visible regions were recorded with a Specord 210 spectrophotometer, using BaSO4 as a white standard and converted into the coordinates of the Kubelka-Munk function. Infrared spectra were recorded with a Perkin Elmer “Spectrum One” FTIR spectrometer in transmittance using the KBr pellets method. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using a Perkin-Elmer LS55 luminescence spectrometer under light excitation with λ = 400 nm. Scanning electronic microphotographs (SEM) were obtained with a Tescan Measure 3 microscope, equipped with an Oxford X-max energy-dispersive X-ray assay for 80 mm2, for an accelerating voltage of 5−20 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) investigations were performed with an ESCALAB™ 250Xi (Thermo Scientific) XPS spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV). The overview and high-resolution XPS spectra were measured at pass energies of 200 eV and 20 eV, respectively. To avoid photodegradation under prolonged exposure to X-rays, the spectra were collected on several fresh points. The XPS spectra were fitted using Voigt profile peaks and Shirley-type backgrounds."
5,Photocatalytic experiments,"2.4 Photocatalytic experiments The photocatalytic activity of the obtained materials was investigated in the hydrogen evolution reaction from aqueous solutions of electron-donor substrates–mixtures of ethanol and lactic acid, which according to our previous work [32] are optimal in such systems. The given amount of photocatalyst (0.05 g) and co-catalyst Pd (1%)/SiO2 (0.01 g) were added to the aqueous solution of the electron-donor substrates (5 mol/L of ethanol, 3 mol/L of lactic acid) and placed into a glass reactor. Then, the reactor was degassed for 10−15 min with a vacuum pump (pressure <0.1 mm Hg). The stirred reaction mixture was irradiated using a high-pressure mercury lamp DRSH-1000 under visible light with λ > 400 nm allocated by ZhS10 cut-off light filter. The light intensity was measured using a ferrioxalate actinometer at λ = 405 nm selected by a combination of light filters ZhS10 + PS13. The amount of hydrogen in the system was determined chromatographically. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of hydrogen was calculated by the formula: AQY 405 nm = V H 2 × 2 I 405 n m × 100 % where V(H2) is the hydrogen evolution rate (mol/h), and I is the intensity of light (mol·quanta/h)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Structure and morphology,"3.1 Structure and morphology 3.1.1 X-ray diffraction spectra The diffractogram of the material obtained by calcining of melamine in the air is shown in Fig. 1 . In the XRD pattern, two characteristic reflexes of g-C3N4 are observed. The main one at 2θ = 27.4° corresponds to the interplane spacing between monolayers d002 = 0.326 nm. The second one at 13.0° is less intense and comes from the periodicity with d100 = 0.681 nm between heptazine fragments, which alternate within a single monolayer [33]. The diffractograms of the samples obtained by the additional processing of the original g-C3N4 in the molten salts undergo significant changes (Fig. 1). In particular, a new intensive reflex at 2θ = 28.0° (d = 0.318 nm) is observed for the samples thermally treated both in the stream of argon and in air. This indicates an increase in the degree of planarity of carbon nitride layers, leading to an increase in the electron interaction between the π-systems of neighboring layers and their convergence [34]. However, the preserving of the peak at 2θ = 27.2° indicates the presence of several polytypes with different interlayer stacking [35]. A reduction of the argon flow and the post-synthesis thermal treatment of the bulk g-C3N4 in the air lead to redistribution in the intensities between these two peaks (polytypes). In addition, a new reflex at 2θ = 8.1° (d = 1.09 nm) is observed in the X-ray diffraction patterns of the CGCNs. The reasons for its appearance can be a specific arrangement of tri-s-triazine units within the monolayer [29–31], as well as an incorporation of K atoms, which are larger than C and N, into the g-C3N4 crystal lattice [36]. The peak shifts from 27.4 to 28.0°, its narrowing, and also the appearance of a new narrow peak at 2θ = 8.1°, according to the literature [29], points to the increasing the sample crystallinity after treatment in the molten salt. It should be noted that there are several low-intensity diffraction peaks at 2θ = 14.0, 21.5, 36.0, 44.0° (marked by stars in Fig. 1) in all diffractograms of the CGCN samples. The most distinct ones belong to the diffractogram of the CGCN (Air) sample, which may correspond to potassium poly(triazine imide) (PTI) [36,37]. This indicates the possibility of PTI formation from g-C3N4 during its heat treatment in the LiCl and KCl melt. 3.1.2 UV-vis spectra The additional thermal treatment of the initial carbon nitride in the LiCl and KCl melt leads to a significant increase in the intensity and the bathochromic shift of the band corresponding to the absorption of carbon nitride. These changes are consistent with the literature data [29]. As can be seen from Fig. 2 a, the absorption edge is shifted from 450 nm to about 460 nm, which corresponds to a decrease in the band gap from 2.82 to 2.75 eV (Fig. 2b). The magnitude of the bathochromic shift is almost the same for all crystalline samples and does not depend on the thermal treatment conditions of the original g-C3N4 in the molten salt in the air or inert atmosphere. Such spectral changes, according to [34], can be explained by the increase in the length of the conjugation regions within the individual carbon nitride layers and the decrease of their interlayer distance as a result of the enhancement of the van der Waals interaction between adjacent layers. 3.1.3 Infrared spectra In the IR spectra of all obtained carbon nitride samples (Fig. 3 ) in the range of 3000−3500 cm−1, there is a broad band due to valence vibrations of H–bonded adsorbed water molecules and residual amino groups. The presence of amino groups is confirmed by the observation of a deformation vibration at 886 cm−1 [12]. The maximum of the broad absorption band undergoes a shift from 3160 cm−1 in the spectrum of g-C3N4 to 3420 cm−1 for CGCN samples (Fig. 3). According to [38], such a shift could indicate a denser packing of heptazine blocks with the removal of a portion of the excess amino groups between which the formation of hydrogen bonds is possible. In addition, in the infrared spectra of the crystalline CGCN samples (Fig. 3), a band at 2168 cm−1 appears, which corresponds to the vibrations of CN terminal groups, originating from the loss of ammonia during the heat treatment in the molten salt [29,31]. In the spectra of all CGCN samples, two bands at 990 and 1150 cm−1 can be assigned to symmetric and asymmetric vibrations of metal-NC2 groups, respectively [36]. These bands can serve as additional evidence of the introduction of potassium atoms into g-C3N4 crystalline lattice. All samples of carbon nitride show a clear band at 808 cm−1, so-called ""fingerprint"" of the triazine and heptazine heterocycles (deformation vibrations of NCN bonds) [12,31]. In addition, there is a set of bands at 1700−900 cm−1, which can be attributed to the vibrations of the tri-s-triazine lattice [12], as well as deformation vibrations of water. It should be noted that the IR spectrum of CGCN (Air) is similar to the spectra of CGCN (2) and CGCN (1) and does not have bands that could indicate the formation of oxygen-containing groups. This indicates a weak influence of air oxygen on the structure of crystalline carbon nitride, obtained by thermal treatment of the original g-C3N4 in the melt. 3.1.4 Photoluminescence spectra The photoexcitation of bulk g-C3N4 (λex = 400 nm) leads to photoluminescence (PL) in the range 420−600 nm (Fig. 4 ) with a maximum at 460 nm (2.70 eV). Compared to the initial g-C3N4, the PL intensity of all CGCN samples is reduced by more than an order of magnitude (Fig. 4). This can indicate an improvement in their crystalline structure and a reduction of the number of structural defects during the thermal treatment of g-C3N4 responsible for the radiative recombination of photogenerated charges. Consequently, quenching of the PL of the samples after thermal treatment of carbon nitride in the melt can contribute to an increase in the efficiency of initiating photocatalytic reactions by photogenerated charges. 3.1.5 Electronic microphotography As shown in SEM micrographs (Fig. 5 a), the bulk g-C3N4 sample comprises of particles of a few micrometers with a visually detected layered structure. These data are consistent with both the results of X-ray diffraction (reflex at 2θ = 27.4°, corresponding to the interplanar distance between monolayers) and the literature data [31]. Additional thermal treatment of bulk g-C3N4 in molten salts leads to significant changes in its morphology, namely the formation of elongated particles of several hundred nanometers length and a width of about 50 nm (Fig. 5b, c), consistent with data of [29]. The thickness of the particles formed is quite small, as evidenced by their low contrast. This indicates that additional thermal processing of the original g-C3N4 does not only lead to an increase in crystallinity of the starting material, but also to its exfoliation and reduction of the lateral size to the nanometer range. It should be noted that the morphology of CGCN (Air) and CGCN (2) samples is similar. So, there is no significant influence of oxygen on the morphology of the samples during the thermal treatment of g-C3N4 in the melt. According to the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, the samples of crystalline carbon nitride, in particular, CGCN (2) and CGCN (Air), contain about 6% of potassium by weight, but they contain no chlorine at all. Lithium cannot be detected by an available EDX detector. These results are consistent with the data from [29], claiming that potassium can be embedded into the structure of carbon nitride under the additional thermal treatment of g-C3N4 in the molten salt. 3.1.6 X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) The survey X-ray photoelectron spectra of the bulk g-C3N4 and the crystalline CGCN(2), CGCN(Air) samples are shown in Fig. 6 a. The surfaces of the samples consist predominantly of carbon and nitrogen with atomic ratios of C:N ≈ 3:4 (Table 1 ). Oxygen is found as an impurity (∼2–4%). Interestingly, the oxygen content in the CGCN(Air) obtained by thermal treatment of bulk g-C3N4 in the molten salt in the air is of the same order of magnitude as for samples similarly treated in argon. The CGCN(2) and CGCN(Air) samples additionally contain K (∼4 %) and Li (∼3 %) while Cl is not detected. The Li1s has significantly lower photoemission cross-section by Scofield compared to the core-level levels of other elements [39], so its peaks in XPS are less pronounced (Fig. 6a, inset). Furthermore, the C1s, N1s, O1s, and K2p high-resolution XPS spectra are considered in more detail for the identification of functional groups at the surface (Fig. 6b-d). The C1s spectra of both the initial and thermally treated g-C3N4 (Fig. 6c) show two peaks at 287.6 and 284.2 eV. The first one, more intense, corresponds to sp2-hybridized carbon in a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring (NC = N). The second one refers to carbon impurities mostly in the form of graphite (CC). Oppositely to the pristine g-C3N4, the thermally treated CGCN(2) and CGCN(Air) samples show a peak at 286.0 eV corresponding to cyano groups (CN) [31], which is in agreement with the results of IR spectroscopy. Two broad features at 292.8 and 298.5 eV in the spectrum of the pristine g-C3N4 correspond to π-π* satellites. The π-π* related peaks in the C1s spectra of CGCN(2) and CGCN(Air) samples strongly overlap with the K2p doublet and are taken into account during fitting. The K2p3/2 and K2p1/2 lines at 292.5 and 295.3 eV (Fig. 6c) are identified against the C1s levels due to characteristic spin-orbit splitting of 2.8 eV and relative peak intensities K2p3/2/K2p1/2 ≈ 2:1. The K2p doublet is detected both in CGCN(2) and CGCN(Air), however, it is absent in the initial bulk sample. The presence of K is additionally confirmed by the K2s line in the survey spectra (Fig. 6a). In the N1s spectra (Fig. 6d), four main components are considered in the fittings. The most intense one at 397.9–398.0 eV corresponds to sp2-hybridized nitrogen in the tri-s-triazine ring (CN = C). These data are in agreement with the C1s spectra and indicate an overwhelming amount of nitrogen in the form of aromatic triazine or heptazine rings. The peak at 400.2–400.3 eV, according to [29,37], corresponds to tertiary nitrogen in the groups N-(C)3. Apparently, the content of the tertiary nitrogen during the thermal treatment in the melt remains unchanged, which is consistent with our idea about the arrangement of heptazine blocks during modification of the original g-C3N4. The component at 398.7–398.8 eV corresponds to nitrogen of amino groups (-NH2, -NH-) in bridged or terminal positions and at defects associated with pyrrole blocks [40,41]. After thermal treatment, the contribution of this peak diminishes, which indicates a decrease in the number of amino groups due to the crosslinking of heptazine blocks. This result is again consistent with the IR spectroscopy data. The broad peaks at 403.0–403.5 and 405.3–405.7 eV can be interpreted as n-π* satellites of the aromatic heptazine fragments in the structure of g-C3N4. The O1s spectra can be fitted with two components with maxima at 530.7–531.0 and 532.0–532.3 eV for all samples (Fig. 6b). These binding energies are typical for CO and CO groups in organic compounds and graphene oxide [40] and may indicate minor surface oxidation of carbon nitride that is natural due to the storage and processing of the samples in the air. It is especially interesting that the oxygen content in the CGCN(Air) sample does not exceed the oxygen content in the CGCN(2) sample thermally annealed in argon (Table 1). These facts allow concluding that air oxygen negligibly affects the content and type of the functional groups at the surface of g-C3N4 during annealing in the LiCl + KCl molten salt at 550 °C."
8,Photocatalytic performance,"The investigation of the photocatalytic activity of carbon nitride samples was carried out in the reaction of molecular hydrogen evolution from aqueous solutions of biodegradable electron-donor substrates – ethanol and lactic acid – under visible light. As can be seen from Fig. 7 , the rate of hydrogen formation in the presence of CGCN exceeds the corresponding rate of the original g-C3N4 by more than an order of magnitude. Reducing the flow of argon under additional treatment of g-C3N4 in LiCl + KCl melt does not significantly reduce the photocatalytic activity of CGCN samples. In the case of CGCN (Air), the photocatalytic activity reaches almost the same value as for using the CGCN(2) sample and amounts to 520 μmol × h−1 × g−1. Under optimal synthesis conditions, the maximum value of the quantum yield of hydrogen at λ = 405 nm excitation is about 22%. Thus, the thermal treatment of g-C3N4 in molten salts in order to obtain crystalline carbon nitride can be carried out without the use of inert gas, while retaining high photocatalytic activity. This greatly simplifies the process of synthesis of the photocatalyst, removes the necessity of inert atmosphere usage (N2 or Ar) and opens up the way for its up-scaling. It is worth noting that the synthesis of one sample (ca. 0.6 g) in the inert medium requires about 1–2 kg of Ar or any other inert gas [29–32]. In the course of studying several factors that influence the process of hydrogen evolution from aqueous solutions of electron-donor substrates, it was established that the pre-synthesis of bulk g-C3N4 is a necessary condition for obtaining an active crystalline CGCN (Air) photocatalyst. In particular, the material obtained by processing of melamine in the LiCl + KCl melt at 550 °C within 4 h does not exhibit any photocatalytic activity. The duration of melamine calcining in the synthesis of g-C3N4 also significantly influences the efficiency of the CGCN photocatalyst in hydrogen evolution (Fig. 8 ). With the increase of the calcining time to 1 h, the photocatalytic activity of the resulting crystalline carbon nitride increases, and then practically does not change in the investigated time interval. The results obtained indicate that the formation of g-C3N4 from melamine is almost complete during the first hour of synthesis and the resulting carbon nitride remains stable with further calcining. The dependence of the photocatalytic activity of CGCN (Air) in the hydrogen evolution upon the synthesis temperature of the initial g-C3N4 is described by a dome-shaped curve. The activity of CGCN photocatalysts reaches a maximum value at a melamine calcining temperature of 550 °C and then slowly decreases with further temperature increase (Fig. 9 ). The decrease in the photocatalytic activity of CGCN (Air) with an increase of the temperature of g-C3N4 synthesis can be attributed to the increase in the number of defects in crystalline carbon nitride, which are the centers of recombination of photogenerated charges. An increase in the number of defects thus leads to a decrease in the efficiency of hydrogen evolution. Conditions: mphotocatalyst = 0.03 g, m (Pd/SiO2) = 0.01 g; C(lactic acid) = 3 mol/L; C(ethanol) = 5 mol/L; λirr > 400 nm; τ(calcining) = 2 h."
9,Conclusions,"The influence of the synthesis conditions of crystalline graphitic carbon nitride on its photocatalytic activity under visible light was investigated in the process of molecular hydrogen evolution from an aqueous solution of a mixture of lactic acid and ethanol as electron-donor substrates. It was established that a decrease of argon flow at additional calcination of g-C3N4 in LiCl + KCl salts does not significantly reduce the photocatalytic activity of CGCN samples. The morphology of CGCN (Air) obtained by the aerobic way is similar to the morphology of the sample synthesized in an inert medium (CGCN (2) or CGCN (1)). In addition, there are no significant differences between the electronic reflection spectra, IR and XPS spectra of CGCN (2) or CGCN (1) synthesized in inert gas and the presence of air – CGCN (Air). Therefore, thermal treatment of g-C3N4 in the melt in order to obtain CGCN (Air) can be carried out without the use of inert gas, retaining high photocatalytic activity. It greatly simplifies the process of synthesis, decreases the amount of reagents for synthesis, namely 1–2 kg of inert gas per 1 sample [29–32] and opens the way for synthesis scale-up. It has been shown that the preliminary synthesis of graphite carbon nitride by melamine calcining is a necessary condition for obtaining active CGCN (Air) samples since the material obtained by the treatment of the melamine in the LiCl + KCl melt at 550 oC for 4 h does not exhibit photocatalytic activity in the investigated process. The photocatalytic activity of CGCN (Air) is significantly influenced by the duration of calcination of melamine. Increase of the duration of melamine thermal treatment up to 1 h, the photocatalytic activity of crystalline carbon nitride increases, and then practically does not change in the investigated time interval. The obtained results indicate that the formation of g-C3N4 from melamine stops in the first hour of synthesis, and the resulting carbon nitride remains stable at further calcination. The dependence of the photocatalytic activity of CGCN (Air) in the hydrogen formation depends on the temperature maintained during the synthesis of the original g-C3N4. The activity of the CGCN (Air) samples first increases, reaching a maximum at a melamine calcination temperature of 550 oC, and then slowly decreases, which could be explained in terms of the number of defects growth in the final crystalline carbon nitride. Such defects could act as recombination centers for photogenerated charges to reduce photocatalytic activity. According to our opinion, future trends in crystalline nitride studies – an extension of its photosensitivity to a wider wavelength region with the same high photocatalytic activity."
