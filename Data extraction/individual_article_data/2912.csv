0,Introduction,"Continuously increasing demand of energy of the contemporary society is the consequences of tremendous changes in life style. On the other hand, due to the limited life span, fossil fuels are unable to deliver it fully because of its limited reserve, high fluctuation in cost and their serious environmental impact on the environment (Gonzalez and Rong, 2019; Duffy et al., 2018). Renewable energy production and utilization is one of the most attentive topics and currently seems to be potential alternative to replace fossil fuels (Rosen and Fayegh, 2016). In this context, biofuels are suggested to be highly potential and green alternative as the renewable energy sources, and may be capable to compete with the global energy crises, originated due to the various limitations of fossil fuels (Kumar and Majid, 2020; Saravanakumar et al., 2016). Moreover, biofuels production using biomass is considered as a potential solution to overcome these challenges (Ahorsu et al., 2018; Ben Iwo et al., 2016). Biomasses are one of the most versatile carbon rich, renewable and low-cost resources, being employed to produce various kinds of biofuels like biodiesel, bioethanol, biobutanol, biogas and biohydrogen (Beschkov, 2017; Busic et al., 2018). Among these, biohydrogen is known to be an excellent renewable energy source and has received enormous attention because of its unique properties like being inexhaustible, renewable, pollution free and low-cost (Hroncova et al., 2016). Additionally, it also acknowledges to carry the highest energy density and no carbon dioxide is generated since the combustion of H2 produces only water vapor as the by-product (Salvatore et al., 2021; Billaud et al., 2016). Hydrogen can be produced using different techniques such as physical, chemical and biological processes (Raghulchandrana et al., 2020). Among these, biological process of hydrogen production presents significant advantages over the other processes due to the various advantages e.g. less cost-intensive, use of diverse organic substrates and microorganisms, meanwhile being the renewable in nature and eco-friendly (Xia et al., 2018; Islam et al., 2021). Lignocellulosic biomasses have huge availability, comprising of high cellulosic content and thus can be utilized as sustainable and renewable substrates for the hydrogen production through biological routes (Al-Battashi et al., 2019; Kucharska et al., 2018). Cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin are the main constituents of the lignocellulosic biomass, and their availability in free form is essential for the effective bioconversion following dark fermentation (Akubude et al., 2021; Sarangi and Nanda, 2020). Biohydrogen production through dark fermentation (DF) using sugar hydrolyzate shows various advantages e.g. high H2 production rate, use of broad range of organic substrates, but suffers from the drawback of low yield (Osman et al., 2020; Mishra et al., 2019; Bhatia et al., 2021). Further, it is noticed that due to the high H2 production rate, huge amount of low fatty acids are formed as the metabolites which makes the fermentation medium more acidic and thus impedes the H2 production process (Slezak et al.,2020). However, these low fatty acids are the key substrates for photo-fermentative (PF) H2 production, but this route suffers from the poor yield of H2. Nevertheless, the above drawbacks involved in case of DF and PF can be overcome when both the processes are combined, and this will significantly contribute to enhance the H2production rate and yield both. Thus, following such an integrated approach high cumulative biohydrogen production can be achieved (Ntaikou, 2021; Cai et al., 2019; Islam et al., 2021). In view of the above facts, the objective of the present review is to provide an assessment and the feasibility of integrated biohydrogen production as an advanced biochemical route to improve and accelerate the biohydrogen production technology in a sustainable manner. The review also evaluates practical viability of the integrated approach of biohydrogen production along with future analysis to elevate this technology on the commercial ground while implementing various economical and environment friendly approaches."
1,Lignocellulosic biomass to Biohydrogen: Process overview,"Cellulose rich biomass is an ideal candidate considered nowadays for the second-generation biofuels production due to their huge advantages like being renewable, broadly and easily availability, perennial nature, relatively easy bioconversion, non-toxic, environment friendly as well as pollution free characteristics (Ferdes, et al., 2020). Among various available processes of biohydrogen production, dark fermentation is known to be the most prominent, explores maximum possibility to utilize lignocellulosic substrate for the biohydrogen production (Fatma et al., 2018; Calderon and Arantes, 2019). Additionally, lignocellulosic biomasses are the highest cellulose containing biomass and therefore most effectively studied for biohydrogen production following the dark fermentation (Venegas et al., 2015). Agro-industrial residues such as sugarcane bagasse, cornstalk, corn stover, corn cobs, corn bran, wheat straw, sorghum rusk, sorghum leaves, sorghum stover, rice straw, rice bran, rice husk and oat straw, are well reported for the dark fermentative biohydrogen production (Wei et al., 2016; Wang and Yin, 2018; Sekoai and Daramola, 2018; Raghulchandrana et al., 2020; Magalhaes et al., 2019). However, the complex structures of these biomasses require complicated pretreatment method for making it simple which are the factors and directly influencing the efficiency of biohydrogen production technology. Three polymers namely cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin build up the complete structure of the biomass which is needed to be firstly processed to remove lignin and hemicellulose via pretreatment methods (Baruah et al., 2018). Removal of lignin and hemicellulose creates smooth passage of cellulose, breaking down into sugar via enzymatic hydrolysis under the optimum conditions. Enzymatic hydrolysis can be proceeded by mutual interaction of cellulase enzymes and lignocellulosic biomass under the optimum condition by producing high amount of sugars (Zoghlami and Paës, 2019; Robak and Balcerek, 2018). Although, sugar production via bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass is one of the main concerns of the biohydrogen production technology, the complicated pretreatment methods and utilizations of costly cellulolytic enzymes makes the overall process less economically viable (Loow et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2018). Pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) can be done by three different methods e.g. physical, chemical and biological. Among these, chemical pretreatment method is most-effective and frequently used to remove the lignin contents. However, due to the high cost of the chemicals and neutralizing agents, this process is not always feasible for the industrial application. In addition to the pretreatment cost, enzymatic hydrolysis cost of LCB via cellulase enzyme is another point of concern for its industrial and economic application. Moreover, at present, these cellulolytic enzymes are produced using synthetic substrate by implementing genetically modified strains separately which further increases the overall cost of the biomass to biohydrogen production technology. In this reference, use of low-cost sustainable technologies for the effective pretreatment and low-cost enzyme production may be useful to cut down the major challenges significantly. With the combination of suitable pretreatment processes and low cost substrate based efficient cellulase production either from mesophilic or thermotolreant microorganism may help to cut down the overall production cost involved in biohydrogen using LCB. Several studies have explored that the chemical pretreatment and thermotolreant fungi could be potential contributors for cutting down the cost involved in LCB to biohydrogen production process (Nadeem et al., 2020). Nevertheless, inhibitors formation is one of the major constrains related to the pretreatment process of LCB which hinders the overall productivity of the enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation process (Bundhoo and Mohee, 2016; Srivastava et al., 2020). Kumar et al., (2015), reported detoxification methods for the pre-hydrolysates obtained via pretreatment and concluded that the efficiency of any detoxification method depends on both, firstly on hydrolyzate composition, which differs according to the raw material used and secondly on the hydrolysis conditions employed therein. Because several inhibitory compounds are formed during the hydrolysis, the identification of these inhibitory compounds, optimization of the hydrolytic process and the choice of the best hydrolyzate detoxification method are crucial for improving the efficiency of the fermentative processes. As each detoxification method is specific to a certain types of compounds, better results can be obtained by combining two or more different methods (Reddy et al., 2017). Furthermore, biomass to biohydrogen production process also depends upon the types of microorganisms employed in fermentation process. Anaerobic bacteria like Enterobacter, Bacillus, and Clostridium are well known H2 producers at large scale via dark fermentation in case of both SSF [simultaneous saccharification and fermentation] and SHF [separate hydrolysis and fermentation] (Kucharska et al., 2018; Pugazhendhi et al., 2019). Based on the intense research studies, it is well established that the SHF is superior to SSF because of the feasibility to avoid the harmful impact of the enzymatic hydrolysis such negative impacts of inhibitors, raised temperature due to the shaking conditions and the pH change which directly affect the fermentative microorganisms and consequently biohydrogen production (Shanmugam et al., 2020). Nevertheless, it usually noticed that the high H2 production rate may lead dark fermentative medium highly acidic soon due to the large amount of the produced acidic metabolites e.g. acetic acid, butyric acid, malic, propionic, fumaric and succinic acid (Wainaina et al., 2019; Petra Muri et al., 2016; Baumann and Westermann, 2016). Because of the high production of these metabolites as the byproducts, hydrogen production ceases soon and thereby hinders the overall H2 production yield (Nagy et al., 2018). Nevertheless, these metabolites effluent i.e. volatile fatty acids (VFAs) are the potential substrate for the photo-fermentative bacteria to produce H2 via photo-fermentation under the optimized conditions (Liu et al., 2015; Cai et al., 2019; Ghosh et al., 2018). Additionally, by consuming these VFAs effluent the overall biohydrogen production can be significantly enhanced by overcoming the challenge of low H2 production rate in case of photo-fermentation. Therefore, following the integrated approach as presented in this review that combines dark and photo fermentation (DF + PF) while using LCB as substrate can further improve the biomass to biohydrogen production process, significantly. Table 1 describes various studies reported on the dark and photo-fermentation using LCB for biohydrogen production."
2,Dark fermentation: Concept & mechanism,
3,Concept,"3.1 Concept Biological fermentation mode of H2 production in absence of light is regarded as dark fermentation which also known to be the simplest H2 production methods at ambient condition while using organic substrates (Soares et al., 2020; Mishra et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019a). This is the very commonly used biological method of H2 production using versatile range of organic and cellulosic wastes (Rosa and Silva, 2017; Hajizadeh et al., 2021). Apart from the substrate versatility and simple operation mode, H2 production rate is much higher in this mode when compared to other known fermentative methods along with the feasibility to utilize various fermentative microorganisms (Preethi et al., 2019; Sivagurunathan et al., 2017). Clostridium beijerinckii, Clostridium butyricum, Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter asburiae are some well known potential producers of H2 in dark fermentation process using versatile range of substrates (Wang and Yin, 2019). Moreover, potential consumptions of different lignocellulosic biomass by these microorganisms have been well reported in literatures (Ding et al., 2016; Ferdes, et al., 2020). Furthermore, like any other biochemical process, dark fermentative biohydrogen production is also influenced greatly by its physicochemical parameters like temperature, pH, hydraulic retention time, inoculum amount and size (Preethi et al., 2019; Sivagurunathan et al., 2017). In addition, H2 production is completely driven by the presence of two major H2-producing enzymes; hydrogenase and nitrogenase (Mishra et al., 2019; Najafpour et al., 2016). Hydrogenase catalyzes the inter-conversion of hydrogen to protons and electrons, and are categorized into three classes namely; [NiFe]-hydrogenase, [FeFe]-hydrogenase, and [Fe]-hydrogenase (Ogata and Lubitz, 2020). Further, these enzymes are participated into two pathway of dark fermentation known as; the acetate pathway which gives theoretical yield of 4 mol H2 from 1 mol glucose whereas the other pathway called as the butyrate pathway and gives the theoretical yield of 2 mol H2 from 1 mol glucose (Islam et al., 2021; Sarangi and Nanda, 2020; Sekoai and Daramola, 2018). In the first stage of dark fermentation, NADH is produced viaoxidation of substrate into pyruvate and may be utilized by microorganisms having NADH: ferredoxinoxidoreductase (NFOR) to produce reduced ferredoxin (Pandey et al., 2021; Preethi et al., 2019).While in the second stage, pyruvate can be converted in to acetyl-CoA and formate by pyruvate formatelyase (PFL) or acetyl-CoA and reduced ferredoxinviapyruvate-ferredo; xinoxidoreductase (PFOR) to produce H2 (Zhou et al., 2015; Sağır and Hallenbeck, 2019). Nevertheless, high production of acids during this process lowers the yield of H2and is considered as one of the biggest challenges required to be addressed by researchers. The acids metabolites like ethanol, acetic acid, fumaric, lactic, butyric acid, and propionic acid are produced along with the dominant end product PHB. The overall process of dark fermentative reaction can be presented by following equations (Sarangi and Nanda, 2020): (1) C6H12O6 + 2NAD+→2CH3COCOO−+4H++ 2NADH (2) CH3COCOO−+CoA-H → acetylCoA + HCOO− (PFLP) (3) HCOO−+H+→CO2 + H2 (4) CH3COCOO− + CoA + Ferredoxin (Fd)ox → acetyl CoA + Fdred + CO2 (PFORP) (5) Fdred + 2H+→ Fdox + 2H2 (6) Acetyl CoA + H2O → CH3COO− + H+ + CoA-H (7) Acetyl CoA + 2NADH + 2H+ → CH3CH2OH + CoA-H + 2NAD+ H2 NADH + H+→NAD+ + Efficiency of the dark fermentative biohydrogen productions have been investigated in many studies (Pandey et al., 2021; Preethi et al.,2019). Reddy et al., (2017), investigated biohydrogen production using sugarcane bagasse under the dark fermentation. About 69.6% biohydrogen production was found in presence of magnetite nanoparticles using Enterobacteriaceae, Clostridium spp. Whereas control system (absence of nanoparticles) showed maximum hydrogen yield (HY) of 0.874 mol (mol glucose−1) at the optimum pH 0.5.0 Table 1 summarizes numerous studies reported on the dark-fermentative biohydrogen production using different types of lignocellulosics biomass."
4,Mechanism,"3.2 Mechanism The fermentative H2 production pathway adaptation depends upon the types of microorganism responsible for performing the dark fermentation (Li et al., 2019). Microorganism PFL pathway was not able to utilize NADH for H2 generation, resulting theoretical value limited to 2 mol of H2per mol of glucose (Srivastava et al., 2017). Further, in the intermediate stage, Acetyl-CoA is ultimately transforming into lower VFAs salt like acetate, butyrate as well as ethanol. The acetate pathway offers the highest yield of 4 mol H2/mol glucose (4 mol of H2 from 1 mol of glucose, 33% of theoretical yield 12H2) and this happens due to the avoiding of additional consumption of NADH by microorganism while H2is produced. Moreover, only 4 mol of H2/mol of glucose is considered as the maximum hydrogen yield via direct dark fermentation of glucose and refer as the Thauer limit (Thauer et al., 1977). Whereas, practicallyH2 yields are lower than the theoretical value being in the range of 1.2–2.3 mol H2 /mol glucose. In contrast, the butyrate pathway is limited to 2 mol H2/mol glucose [Fig. 1 ]. Osman et.al (2020) studied the biohydrogen production via dark fermentation using rice straw as substrate and Clostridium pasteurianum employed as the fermentative microorganism. A maximum 47.6 mL/g hydrogen yield was reported at initial pH 7.5 and temperature 37 °C (Osman et.al., 2020). Following the similar pattern Soares et. al, reported biohydrogen production using Rice, corn and wheat residues employed as the lignocellulosic biomass (Soares et. al, 2020). The result so obtained revealed that biohydrogen production were ranging from 12 to 7019 mL H2/L via mixed culture under the optimum condition of temperature 37 °C, pH 7.0 and the hydraulic retention time 72 h (Soares et al., 2020). Similarly, Bhatia et al. (2021) recorded the highest specific H2 yield of 4 mol H2/mol glucose or 497.8 mL H2 /g glucose via the acetic acid pathway (Bhatia et al., 2021)."
5,Photo-fermentation: Concept & mechanism,
6,Concept,"4.1 Concept Photo-fermentation is another most popular and adopted mode of biological hydrogen production after the dark fermentation, which is facilitated via the photosynthetic purple non-sulphur (PNS) bacterial group (Reungsang et al., 2018). These bacteria may utilize long and short chain of volatile fatty acids which can be efficiently converted into H2 and the related metabolites via nitrogenase enzyme under the presence of light source (Pandey et al., 2021). Additionally, these bacteria have the capability to utilize broad range of organic substrates while using energy in form of light to produce H2 efficiently. Further, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Rhodobacter capsulatus, Rhodovulums ulfidophilumW-1S and Rhodopseudomonas palustris, Rhodobacter species are the group of PNS bacteria and well known for H2 production via photo-fermentation with high yield using VFAs as substrate (Kessi and Hörtensteiner, 2018; Mishra et al., 2019). Organic acids, such as acetic, butyric, propionic, malic, and lactic are potential VFAs substrates that have been reported for the significant photo-fermentative H2 production (Pandey et al., 2021; Assawamongkholsiri et al., 2019; Mishra et al., 2019). While some of the investigations have also reported photo-fermentative H2 production directly from the sugars like glucose and sucrose showing their promising nature towards the H2 production (Rai et al., 2014; Pandey et al., 2021). Along with substrate and microbes, physicochemical parameters optimization is also crucial for the high yield of H2in case of photo-fermentation (Soto et al., 2019; Pandey et al., 2021). Most of the photo-fermentative bacterial cell growth and hydrogen production are achieved at medium temperature range 30–40 °C, whereas pH in a range of 5.0–7.0 and at normal atmospheric pressure with different substrate and using different light source having wavelength 522, 805, and 850 nm (Liu et al., 2015). Additionally, effluent of the dark fermentation can be directly used for the photo-fermentation in the sequential process because no pH change is required (Soto et al., 2019). Substrate type and conversion efficiency may also contribute significantly to improve the photo-fermentation mediated H2 production (Zhang and Zhang, 2018). In case of photo-fermentation reaction; substrates’ conversion efficiency of malate, lactate, and acetate can be given as following equations (Assawamongkholsiri et al., 2019): Malate C4H6O5 + 3H2O ------ 6H2 + 4CO2 Lactate C3H6O3 + 3H2O ----- 6H2 + 3CO2 Acetate C2H4O2 + 2H2O ----- 4H2 + 2CO2"
7,Mechanism,"4.2 Mechanism Photo-fermentative H2 production via PNS is also an enzyme system called as nitrogenase mediated biochemical process which can be conducted using variety of different organic acids as electron donor (Higuchi-Takeuchi and Numata, 2019). The electrons released by the carbon substrate are pumped via large number of electron carriers while protons are pumped over the membrane forming proton gradient, generating ATP in the presence of ATP synthase. The excess ATP formed could be utilized to transport the additional electrons to the electron acceptor ferredoxin (Fd) (Jianga et al., 2020). Additionally, in the absence of molecular nitrogen, the electrons placed from ferredoxin are used by nitrogenase to reduce protons into hydrogen. Photo-fermentation has been reported to be high theoretical hydrogen yield which is 8 mol of H2/mol of glucose via PNS bacteria (Mishra et al., 2019). Whereas, the key drawbacks associated with this process include high-energy consumption, low solar energy conversion efficiencies, and the low volumetric production rates (Arimi, et al., 2015). It is reported that the maximum H2 yield is dependent upon the kind of organic acids chosen, for an example butyric acid gives the theoretical highest yield (HY) of 10 mol H2/mol substrate, while acetic acid yields the lowest value of 4 mol H2/mol substrate (Zhang et al., 2017) [ Fig. 2 ]. The chemical equation for photo-fermentative hydrogen production from acetate is given in the following equations. 2CH3COOH + 2H2O → 4H2 + 2CO2, ΔGo = + 104 kJ In biological photo-fermentative hydrogen production process practical HY is always less than the theoretical HY and this might be due to the various environmental impact such as temperature, pH fluctuations, viability rate of microorganism in the fermentative medium, substrate-production inhibition and also the impact of intermediate inhibitors (Zhang et al., 2017). Liu et al., (2015) recorded hydrogen yield of 160 mL-H2/60 mL using acetic acid as substrate, at pH 7.0 and with inoculum time of 14 h using bacterium Rhodopseudomonas sp. nov. strainA7 (Liu et al., 2015). Mishra et al. (2016), performed photo-fermentative H2 production and recorded an yield of 2.86 mL H2/mL POME using isolated Rhodopseudomonas palustris under the light illumination of 4 flux, temperature 30 °C, in a batch operational mode (Mishra et al., 2016). Lu et al., (2016) also investigated the maximum specific hydrogen yield (SHY) of 111.85 ± 1 mLH2/g TS using apple waste as substrate via photo-synthetic bacteria (PSB) HAU-M1 at initial pH 7.14, light intensity of 3029.67 lx and temperature 30.46 °C following the RSM method (Lu et al., 2016)."
8,Integrated biohydrogen production via dark and photo-fermentation,"In spite of being the most advantageous and sustainable method, both the fermentative biohydrogen production methods (DF and PF) suffer fromcertain drawbacks which creates main hurdles in the way of sustainable and economic biohydrogen production technology (Islam et al., 2021; Ghosh et al., 2018; Cabrol et al., 2017). Low yield, unavailability of the potential substrates and the high production cost are the main drawbacks of DF process whereas poor H2production rate is the main constrain of PF process. In this reference, integration of both the processes while using LCB as the substrate may help to overcome these challenges (Cheng et al., 2011a). Further, utilization of the VFAs as the effluent of DF which are produced in large amount can be exploited as initial substrate for PF process either by directly or by incorporating with minor physicochemical parameters changes. This strategy may likely to improve the overall yield of H2 (Patel et al., 2021). Thus, by using residual organic VFAs like acetic acid, butyric acids, lactate, formate and propionic acids in PF process is an excellent approach and has enormous potential to be employed in the integrated fermentation technology (Liu and Smith, 2020; Mohsenpour et al., 2020). Moreover, this process does not require any external pH adjustment, substrate inhibition and also reduces the operational time due to the running operation in a single stage (Kehrein et al., 2020). The maximum conversion of substrate in to H2 can be achieved directly by combined DF and PF process at minimum physicochemical changes. Moreover, the highest theoretical hydrogen yield up to 12 mol H2/mol glucose can be achieved via this integrated approach (Patel et al., 2018). The integrated biohydrogen production can be operated in a single batch system or in a sequential two step batch system. In the single stage batch system of H2 production, both types of microorganisms responsible for the DF and PF are utilized in mixed form under the certain optimized conditions, but the pH control is difficult. Additionally, microorganisms performing both the processes may also have to face mutual metabolites inhibitory effect along with the substrate and the product inhibition factors. On the other hand, in case of sequential two stage integrated H2 production system, microorganisms of PF process are introduced to the reaction medium after the completion of DF meanwhile with the possible adjustment of the pH if required (Tawfik and El-Qelish, 2012). In addition, temperature of this system is best suited in the range 28–30 °C, which is also the common temperature range of DF and PF mode of H2 production. Moreover, the optimum experimental conditions would not be compromised in case of two stage sequential integrated H2 production system (Yang et al. 2015). The positive impact of the integrated process that combines DF and PF exhibited improved H2 production, and has been confirmed by previous studies (Cheng et al., 2011b; Tawfik and El-Qelish, 2012; Ghimire et al., 2016; Mishra et al., 2019). Ghimire et al., (2016), investigated an integrated biohydrogen strategy while using effluent of DF in form of organic acids and alcohol under the optimum conditions e.g. pH 6.5, and temperature 24 ± 2 °C. The total 256 (±2) N mL H2/g chemical oxygen demand (COD) could be achieved in a sustainable manner. Further, Mishra et al. (2016), conducted a single stage sequential H2 production by integrating DF and PF process. The maximum H2 yield could be gained in the first stage of DF was recorded to be 0.78 mL H2/mL POME, which further could be enhanced up to 2.86 mL H2/mL POME after the photo-fermentation via lab isolate Rhodopseudomonas palustris (Mishra et al., 2019). Pandey et al., (2021) investigated the efficiency of Spirulinaplatensis hydrolysateas substrate in DF process mediated by Bacillus firmus NMBL-03 and produced 23.06 ± 3.63 mmol of H2 with yield of 1.92 ± 0.20 mmol H2/g COD reduction. Whereas, in the second stage of PF process, 1510 ± 35 mL/L H2 was recorded using Rhodobacter sphaeroides NMBL-01 under the optimum conditions (Pandey et al., 2021)."
9,Key factors influencing the integrated biohydrogen production: Future prospects,"5.1 Key factors influencing the integrated biohydrogen production: Future prospects 5.1.1 Substrate Substrate and its composition play a key role to improve the integrated biohydrogen production process, especially in case of single stage sequential integrated method (Kuppam et al., 2017). For the enhancement of biohydrogen yield, initial substrate should be highly rich of cellulosic contents. High cellulose and less lignin substrate may reduce the pretreatment time and the cost, meanwhile improve the sugar contents, required for the fermentation to generate H2 (Bhatia et al., 2021; Kucharska et al., 2018). Additionally, lignocellulosic biomasses are known for the highest cellulosic biomass to produce biohydrogen with the generated metabolites. Moreover, high sugar content will also ensure the production of a huge amount of VFAs as the byproduct of dark fermentation and this may be potential as the initial substrate for photo-fermentation (Zagrodnik and Seifert, 2020; Mishra et al., 2019). Bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass via cellulolytic enzymes will also help to reduce the production of inhibitors for continuous production of H2 in DF and PF processes simultaneously. Although, there are a number of lignocellulosic biomass yet needed to be more explored to find out the optimum feed-stocks for improving the H2production rate and the yield and for the sustainable process economy of the integrated H2 production technology (Sivagurunathan et al., 2017; 2017;; Periyasamy et al., 2018). In addition, it is also confirmed from many studies that the organic-rich biomass such as rice straw, wheat straw and sugarcane bagasse have huge potential to be utilized as substrate for the biological mode of hydrogen production (Rai and Singh, 2016; Sołowski et al., 2020; Venegas et al., 2015). Therefore, it may be concluded that the substrate selection directly influence the overall H2production following integrated technique that combines DF and PF process (Osman et. al., 2020). A simple and low-cost pretreatment technology and cellulolytic enzymes production may also improve the sustainability of the overall integrated biohydrogen production process along with the rate and yield of H2 (Li et al., 2018; Islam et al., 2021). However, this research area requires much attention in form of more intense studies for the better exposure at practical ground. Nevertheless, till date limited studies have been devoted on integrated biohydrogen production process using lignocellulosics biomass [Table 2 ]. 5.1.2 Nanocatalyst approach Nowadays, application of nanomaterials is considered as a potential approach to improve the overall biomass to biohydrogen production process when employed as catalyst or co-factor. The unique physicochemical properties of nanomaterials along with feasibility to recycle and long lasting impact can elevate every steps of the biohydrogen production process (Bhatia et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2018; Kwona et al., 2020). In general, use of nanomaterials can improve the efficiency of the chemical pretreatment of biomass, enzyme production and stability in the enzymatic hydrolysis, speed up the fermentation process, product recovery and microorganism growth, and for these reasons use of nano-additive can be considered as advanced area of research (Kayfeci et al., 2019; Kuppam et al., 2017; Mishra et al., 2019). Moreover, utilization of nanomaterials such as, Fe2O3, Fe3O4, NiCo2O4, CuO, NiO, CoO, ZnO have been confirmed to improve the biohydrogen production since they function as a co-factor of enzymes that help to enhance the efficiency of the enzymes involved in both DF and PF process (Srivastava, et al., 2019). For an example, Fe is the key co-factor to influence the enzymatic activity of hydrogenase enzyme in DF whereas nitrogenase enzyme in case of PF process, as well as they are an important nutrient element of the microbial fermentative media for both the process (Teng et al., 2019; Taherdanak et al., 2016). Further, Fe-based nanomaterials may be exploited for multipurpose in the complete process of biomass to biohydrogen production following the integrated fermentation. Additionally, being the catalyst these nanomaterials cannot be spent in the process and hence are required in very less amount for the long term utilizations with no toxic effect in the fermentation medium under the optimal concentration and also participate to improve the metabolite reactions of microorganisms (Jayasekara and Ratnayake, 2019). Further, recycling of the used nanomaterials at each step in the process are possible for their re-utilization again and again at pilot scale which may offer an economic path to achieve its pilot-scale production goal. Concepts of nanomaterials on influencing the DF and PF mediated biohydrogen production have been reported in many studies (Trchounian et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2015; Preethi et al., 2019; Srivastava et al., 2019). Zhang et al. (2015) studied the effect of zero-valent iron activated carbon (ZVIAC) micro-electrolysis system following dark fermentative H2production using glucose and the mixed bacterial consortium. These authors observed positive results with the addition of ZVI that helped to obtain ~ 38.2% more hydrogen yield, and ZVI-AC micro-electrolysis could further enhance the hydrogen yield (improving rate 50.2％). In a recent study, Zhang et al., 2021 evaluated DF process using nickel ferrite nanoparticles and maximum H2 yield of 222 and 130 mL/g of glucose were recorded in presence of 200 mg/L NiFe2O4 NPs (55 °C) groups, respectively, which were much higher than control. It was concluded that NiFe2O4 NPs might functioned as carriers in the intracellular electron transferring during DF mediated H2 production (Zhang et al., 2021). Henceforth, integration of DF and PF while implementing nanomaterials as catalyst can be more effective and sustainable way in the hybrid stage system for improving the process economy of the H2 production using lignocellulosic biomass (Mishra et al., 2019; Nemestóthy et al., 2020). Table 3 also summarizes various studies on the applications of nanomaterials for enhanced biohydrogen production using lignocellulosics biomass. 5.1.3 Genetic engineering Genetic engineering is always considered as booming technology for improving the dark and photo fermentative H2 production process. Metabolic manipulation in microorganisms for both the processes are the most innovative tool, and are being employed from past many years for enhancing the H2 production yield (Preethi et al., 2019). Elimination of H2 uptake gene, modification of homologous or heterologous gene, development of synthetic metabolic reactions and association of various methods are frequently used approaches which may enhance the H2 production significantly (Song et al., 2017; Patel et al., 2018). Moreover, genetic manipulation in H2 producing enzymes in both the processes (DF and PF) like knock out technology is very commonly used method to enhance the biohydrogen production yield (Peters et al., 2015). Additionally, these tools should be used separately for both the processes before performing the integrated technique. Wu et al. (2018), recorded improved H2 production by improving gene expression of NiFe-hydrogenase in Pyrococcusfuriosus. These authors modified three new strains for the determination of the specific hydrogen production activity by reducing methylviologen in form of artificial electron donor. Based on the obtained results, it was concluded that the specific activity of the hydrogen production was 1.14-fold higher in case of genetically manipulated strain as compared to control (Wu et al., 2018). An increment in 2-fold specific hydrogen production rate with unaffected oxygen tolerance were reported in site-directed mutagenesis of [NiFe]-hydrogenase ofE. coli(Flanagan et al., 2016). Further, a number of studies are available on improving the H2 production, employed genetic modification in the size of light harvesting antenna of the photosynthetic apparatus in case of photo-fermentation process (Wu et al., 2018; Song et al., 2017; Patel et al., 2018). Additionally, genetic manipulation in nitrogenase enzymes is also reported in photo-fermentative H2 production either by suppressing, introducing new or over expressing existing genes (SundaraSekar et al., 2017). Zhang et al. (2018), conducted a pilot scale study on sequential integrated biohydrogen production using 11 m3 reactor in which 3 m3 volume was covered by dark whereas 8 m3 by photo compartments. These authors performed dark fermentation at pH 4.5 and 35 °C whereas photo fermentation at pH 7.0 and 30 °C using corn stover employed as substrate. It was noticed that out of the 87.8 ± 3.8 m3/d produced biogas, dark fermentation unit contributed 68%. However, challenges like poor mixing, lack of homogeneity were associated with the large-scale operational condition, caused large variation in hydrogen production rate in case of dark and photo-fermentation. In this context, for the industrial application point of view focus should be given on the selection of both types of fermentative microorganisms (responsible for dark/photo) which may capable to work on either similar or closer pH with efficient H2 production proficiency in order to avoid pH shifting, wastage of resource utilization at large-scale. Further, H2 production can be significantly enhanced by reducing or eliminating the various competing biochemical pathways following the integrated biohydrogen production technology using lignocellulosics biomass as potential substrate. Nevertheless, rigorous studies are needed to be devoted to find out novel strategies to further achieve high H2 production rate and yield using lignocellulosic biomass for its practical application in near future [ Fig. 3 ]."
10,Conclusion,"This review has been devoted on the development of integrated biohydrogen production process as an advanced biochemical technology for the economical production of H2 using lignocellulosic biomass. It was noticed that in spite of a number of advantages, very limited research studies were performed and therefore this technology is needed to be more explored. This review emphasized on numerous aspects like potential utilizations of lignocellulosic biomass as low-cost substrate, implementation of nanocatalyst and genetic manipulation as the possible approaches to elevate the integrated technology of biohydrogen production in a sustainable way for its practical applications in near future."
