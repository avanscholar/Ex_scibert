0,Introduction,"Cleaner, greener and sustainable energy is the need of the hour as continuous use of fossil fuels is causing irreversible damage to the environment. Direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) has been viewed as one of the emerging sustainable technologies which can play a vital role in future for cleaner and greener energy conversions. In DMFCs methanol is used as fuel, which can be produced from agricultural waste and other waste biomass, making it a sustainable source of energy. At the same time DMFC only produces CO2 as byproduct, maintaining the carbon cycle without increasing the carbon footprint. High cost of electrocatalyst and polyelectrolyte membrane used in the cation exchange type of DMFCs are the major hurdle for commercialization of the DMFC technology [1]. An alternative is the alkaline type of DMFCs, wherein the costly noble metal based electrocatalysts can be replaced by low cost metal catalysts [2]. There are several other advantages of alkaline medium in DMFCs, like superior corrosion resistance of DMFC materials in alkaline medium compare to that in acidic medium. During OH− transport via electro-osmotic drag, water is dragged away from cathode side, preventing the flooding problem and transport of OH− from cathode to anode will reduce the methanol crossover, which in case of acidic medium generally gets dragged with H+ ions [3]. But, the roadblock for alkaline type DMFCs is that the commercial polymer electrolyte membranes are still under development [4]. A recent review shows that quaternary ammonium, quaternary phosphonium, imidazolium, guanidinium and piperazinium cations based AEMs have been investigated in literature for their use in Alkaline DMFCs [5]. Most of the polymeric materials used are based on synthetic polymers, which are not easy to degrade and if used in large amounts, will create environmental issues. PVA is one of the synthetic polymers which is well known for its biodegradability in the presence of suitable microorganisms, under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions [6–7]. PVA has been used in both acidic and alkaline type of fuel cells. Maiti et al. (2012) [8] have provided a detailed review on PVA as polyelectrolyte membrane and its current status in relation to commercial Nafion® membrane from DuPont for DMFCs. Similarly, PVA has also been investigated for its application in alkaline direct alcohol fuel cells [4]. The problem with PVA is that it does not contain strong cationic functionalities for hydroxyl ion transport and its hydroxyl ion conductivity is not sufficient enough. Moreover, its water solvency nature creates mechanical stability issues, creating the need for addition of another component in the PVA matrix to improve ion conductivity and mechanical stability. Different organic and inorganic materials have been investigated to improve these properties of PVA membranes [4,8]. In organic materials, mainly polymers are used to prepare a blend with PVA, which brings the environmental concerns back. Other organic materials which can be used includes carbon-based nanofillers such as carbon nanotubes [9], graphene [10], graphene oxide [11] etc. Incorporation of such fillers to polymer matrix to form composite membrane has been reported to enhance hydroxide conductivity and alkaline stability along with providing adequate dimensional stability, good mechanical strength, and improved electrochemical performance [12]. But, cost of production of these materials is high and large scale production is still an issue for them. Inorganic fillers include metals, metal oxide and different metal alloy nanoparticles, different type of clays and zeolites. Some of these require pre-processing, which will increase the cost and some are less efficient in terms of ion conductivity [4]. Several studies have also reported the incorporation of basic materials such as KOH in the membrane, showing good conductivity but poor stability [13–16]. Use of biopolymers and bio-nanofillers produced from waste, along with the PVA matrix for the preparation of AEMs, is another good option to convert waste into wealth. Cellulose and chitosan are the two most abundant biopolymers found in nature. In our previous studies, we have shown the use of chitosan as well as cellulose derived cellulose nanocrystals in PVA matrix for their potential application as ion conductive membranes for acidic type DMFCs [17–18]. Similarly, chitosan has been utilized with the PVA matrix for the alkaline type DMFCs to improve its properties [19–20]. Proteins and their derivatives are another category of biopolymers, which can be extracted from plants and waste animal biomass. Proteins are well known for their charge transferability and photosynthesis is one such example. There are several reports which have described the charge transfer mechanisms for different types of proteins [21–24]. Bradley et al. (2004) [22], in their study have shown the charge transfer between protein and carbon nanotubes. Similarly, Dhar et al. (2019) [25] have prepared genetically engineered protein based nacre-like nanocomposites with superior electrochemical performance, showing the ability of proteins to be utilized for the fabrication of bioengineered devices. Use of protein in biofuel cells as substrate and bioelectrocatalyst is also well stablished [26–28]. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, which contain both acidic and basic functionality. Upon deprotonation amino acids form carboxylate anion and upon protonation they form ammonium cation. Thus, there is a possibility to utilize proteins in the both acidic and alkaline type of polymer electrolyte membranes. Ho et al. (2004) [29] have fabricated ion transport proteins based block copolymer membrane and suggested its possible application to prevent leaking of protons in Nafion® as well as production of current driven by protein, across these membranes in acidic type fuel cells. There are few other reports as well, where amino acids have been directly used to modify the nanofillers and incorporated in different polymer matrixes to prepare proton conductive membrane for acidic type fuel cells [30–33]. For the alkaline type of fuel cell membranes, it is hard to find any such report where proteins or its derivatives (amino acids, peptides) have been utilized as electrolyte. Another issue with proteins or their derivatives is their preparation and purification process, which may enhance the cost of electrolyte membrane. To overcome this issue, the use of the crude proteins from waste biomass without purification and with minor thermo-chemical treatment can be a good alternative to prepare electrolyte. In the current investigation, we have used human hair waste biomass as a source of protein-based electrolyte and incorporated it with PVA matrix to prepare the anion exchange membrane for alkaline DMFC. Human hairs are composed of proteins and α-keratin is the major component. Twisted coil structure with hydrogen bonding and disulfide linkage between keratin strands gives it high chemical and mechanical stability [34] and makes it insoluble in water. Enzymatic and thermo-chemical hydrolysis processes can be used for the disintegration of keratin strands by breaking the disulfide bonds. Hydrolysis process results in the formation of water soluble amino acids, peptides and lower molecular weight keratin [35–36], which makes it easy to utilize and process for the fabrication of electrolyte membrane. Further, there are reports on chemical-free green hydrolysis of keratin in microwave reactor through thermal treatment [35,37]. Based on these facts, a thermal treatment based green approach has been utilized in this study to prepare hair protein-based electrolyte, which has been further characterized and used with PVA matrix to prepare AEMs. Properties of the thus prepared environment-friendly and cost-effective electrolyte based AEMs have been discussed in the subsequent sections."
1,Material and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Poly (vinyl-alcohol) (99% hydrolyzed and Mw-89 000–98 000 Da) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich India. 25% v/v glutaraldehyde (GA) solution was used as crosslinking agent and it was purchased from Rankem, India. Acetone LR grade (99% pure) for washing purpose and methanol AR grade (99.8% pure) for analysis purpose were purchased from HiMedia laboratories private limited, India. 5 wt% Nafion perfluorinarted resin solution was purchased from Sigma–Aldrich, USA. 10 wt% Pt-Ru/C and 10 wt% Pt/C electrocatalysts were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich, India."
3,Green thermal hydrolysis of hairs,"2.2 Green thermal hydrolysis of hairs Indian men human hairs were collected from local barbershop and washed multiple times by Hiclean (Liquid soap from HiMedia laboratories private limited, India) soap solution, and after that with acetone to remove oil and dust. The cleaned hairs were dried in hot air oven at 60 °C overnight. For thermal hydrolysis, a sealed steel vessel with 200 ml capacity was used. Around 500 mg of the dried hairs were taken in the vessel and 50 ml water is added into it. The vessel was sealed and kept on a heating plate at 200 °C for 7 h for thermal hydrolysis. After 7 h of thermal hydrolysis, the solution was centrifuged and the supernatant was taken out in a separate beaker. As per water–vapor pressure–temperature correlation, at 200 °C water-vapors can build pressure up to 15 bar. Thus, high temperature and pressure resulted in the digestion of the hairs during hydrolysis and most parts of it was dissolved in water, resulting in a black-brownish supernatant. The supernatant was dried in a hot air oven at 100 °C. The dried material consisting of mixture of amino acids, peptides and low molecular weight proteins of hair keratein was used for further analysis as well as an ion conductive material in the PVA matrix to prepare AEMs with different weight ratios."
4,Fabrication of PVA-HH based composite AEMs,"2.3 Fabrication of PVA-HH based composite AEMs AEMs with different wt.% loadings (1 wt%, 5 wt% and 10 wt%) of HH in PVA matrix were investigated to find the optimum loading for alkaline fuel cell application. 2 wt% GA was used as a crosslinking agent to provide the PVA matrix mechanical stability in presence of water. A total of 2 g of materials was taken for the preparation of a single AEM, in which the PVA and the HH content was varied as per the wt.% of the hydrolysate. PVA was dissolved in 50 ml of water by stirring at 85 °C and the HH was dissolved in 10 ml of water at room temperature. Both the solutions were mixed along with GA and stirred for 30 min at 85 °C. Later the solution was poured in a 15 cm dia. petri dish and dried at room temperature to prepare the AEMs. For all the wt.% loadings several samples were prepared to carry out different analyses and check the repeatability of the performance of the AEMs. For comparison of the results with base matrix, PVA membranes were prepared by using PVA solution and 2 wt% GA in a similar way. The thickness of the prepared membranes was in the range of 135 ± 20 μm with having diameter of 15 cm."
5,Characterization,"The Presence of proteinaceous material in the HH was confirmed through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), where the carbon and nitrogen elemental analysis was done in a JEOL-JPS-9010MC/SP system with a MgKα X-ray source. Carbon C1s peak at 285.0 eV was taken as the reference. The HH was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (in a PerkinElmer Frontier FT-IR Spectrometer system) for its structural analysis. Molecular weight distribution of the proteinaceous material present in the HH was analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS (matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization – time of flight – mass spectrometry) analysis by using α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix in an Autoflex Speed, Bruker system. The amino acid profile of HH sample was carried out at Aqua Research Laboratory, Department of Zoology, University of Delhi, Delhi, India using automated L-8900 Amino Acid Analyzer (Hitachi Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Initially, hydrolysis of the powdered sample was carried out with 6 N HCl for 22 h at 110 °C. Nitrogen evaporator (PCI Analytics Pvt. Ltd., Maharashtra, India) was used for drying the hydrolyzed sample. In the 0.5 mg/mL concentration of the protein sample, 0.02 N HCl was added. Autosampler was used for injecting the 20 μl of sample volume. Since hydrolysis of sample with 6 N HCl destroys methionine, cysteine and tryptophan, these are estimated using specific reagents. Performic acid and hydrobromic acid (48%) were used for methionine and cysteine. Hydrolysis of the sample was carried out with 4 N methane sulfonic acid and 3-(2-aminoethyl) indole for tryptophan. The rest of the methodology was same for all amino acids. The ninhydrin derivative of proline and hydroxyproline was observed at 440 nm, and monitoring of all the other amino acids was done at 570 nm. Quantification of the amino acids was done based on respective peak area in comparison to the amino acids mixture standard solutions. Wako Pure Chemical Industries Limited, Japan provided the Type B and Type AN-2 standards. Sigma-Aldrich, USA supplied standard solutions for glutamine and tryptophan. Morphology of dried hydrolysate powder, its crosslinked morphology and membrane morphological analyses were carried out using field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) (a SUPRA Ultra-high resolution FESEM system from Carl Zeiss, India). The crystalline nature of dried hydrolysate powder and membrane composites was investigated by X-Ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy (a Rigaku TTRAX, Seifert XRD 3003 T/T model) with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.1541 nm) as X-ray source. Thermal stability analysis of hydrolysate and composite membranes was done by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (in a PerkinElmer Thermogravimetric Analyzer TGA 4000 system), while crystallization and melting behavior of HH was observed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (in a NETZSCH DSC 204 F1 Phoenix system). Water uptake and %swelling of the membranes was checked by using 5 cm2 dried membrane samples. For each wt% composite membrane, three dried samples (for calculating the average value) were taken after noting down their initial weight and dipped in a solution of 0.5 M KOH for 24 h. Then the samples were taken out and their final weight, as well as their dimensions were measured, after removing the surface solution by soft tissue paper. Water uptake was calculated by taking the difference of the initial and final weight of the samples and dividing it by initial weight, which was converted to percentage by multiplying by 100. Similarly, %swelling was calculated by taking the difference of the initial and average final length of the sample and dividing it by initial length and then multiplying the result with 100. The usefulness of the composite membranes for an alkaline fuel cell was checked by ionic conductivity analysis. The ionic conductivity analysis was carried out by using 5 cm2 size three samples of each wt.% membrane in a single cell assembly. Prior to analysis each sample was kept in 0.1 M HCl solution overnight for formation of cations and after that rinsed multiple time with water to remove the excessive acid. The samples were sandwiched between graphite plates with channels for liquid flow. The outer side of each graphite plate was covered by copper plate electrodes and the cell was closed. 0.5 M solution of KOH was prepared and a constant flow of the same solution was maintained in both the sides of the membrane through graphite plate flow channels. Impedance spectroscopy measurements (in an Autolab PGSTAT204 system from Metrohm, India) were carried out after 1 h (after reaching the saturation state of the membrane by KOH solution) in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz at 0.1 V. The impedance measurements were carried out at different cell temperatures between 30 and 70 °C with 10 °C gap and the cell temperatures were maintained within ± 2 °C range. Ionic conductivities of the samples were calculated by using Eq. (1) [17]. Activation energy of ion transfer from one site to next site was calculated by calculated by using Eq. (2), Methanol permeability of the samples was analyzed by cyclic voltammetry in the −1.0 to 0.4 V range at 100 mV/s scan rate. Platinum wire (10 mm length) was used as a working electrode and a 3 mm diameter platinum electrode was used for counter electrode, while Ag/ AgCl was used as a reference electrode for cyclic voltammetry (All the electrodes purchased from Metrohm, India). A calibration curve was prepared for known concentrations of methanol in 0.5 M KOH solution through cyclic voltammetry by plotting the methanol oxidation peak intensity vs concentration. To keep the condition near to real alkaline fuel cell testing conditions, methanol permeability of the samples was carried out in the single cell, similar to ion conductivity analysis. On one side of the membrane 0.5 M methanol and 0.5 M KOH solution was used and the other side of the membrane only 0.5 M KOH solution was used. The methanol permeability tests were carried out for 6 h for each sample (the test was done for three samples for each type of membrane). The methanol crossover through the membrane from the methanol–KOH solution side to only KOH solution side was monitored by cyclic voltammetry analysis by measuring the methanol oxidation peak at different time intervals. The unknown concentration of the methanol that reached the pure KOH solution at different time intervals was calculated by interpolation, using a calibration curve and calculation of methanol permeation was done by using Eq. (3) [17]. (1) σ = L R s A ( S . cm - 1 ) (2) ln ( σ ) = ln σ 0 - E a RT (3) P = kVL A C a ( cm 2 s - 1 ) where σ : Ion conductivity R s : Membrane resistance (calculated by impedance spectroscopy) A : Area of the membrane L : Thickness of the membrane σ 0 : Pre-exponential factor E a : Activation energy R : Gas constant T : Temperature (K) k : Slope of the time vs methanol concentration in the pure KOH solution curve V : Initial volume of the Pure KOH solution C a : Initial concentration of methanol in methanol + KOH solution Swelling is one of the major issues with PVA based membranes. So to further enhance the crosslinking and crystallinity, annealing of the membrane samples was done at 120 °C temperature for 3 h. The HH wt.% sample, which showed the best results among the all the wt.% samples for ionic conductivity, was chosen for annealing and properties like %swelling, water uptake, thermal stability, mechanical stability, thermo-mechanical stability, methanol permeability and ionic conductivity were compared with the sample before annealing. To investigate the changes in the mechanical stability of the membrane, tensile test was carried out on TST350 tensile testing stage from Linkam Scientific. While changes in thermo-mechanical stability of the composite membrane were investigated by dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) (a NETZSCH DMA 242 E model). PVA is water soluble polymer, so to check the stability of the annealed sample in water at higher temperature, the annealed samples were weighed and after that kept in Millipore water at 70 °C for 72 h. After 72 h, the samples were taken out, dried and weighed again to check the weight loss in the samples. To check the stability of the annealed HH based membrane in alkaline medium, an indirect method was used, where the ionic conductivity of the fresh annealed sample was calculated and later the sample was dipped in 0.5 M KOH solution for 10 days. After 10 days the membrane sample was again used to check the ionic conductivity and the decrease in the ionic conductivity was used as indirect measure of decrease in stability of the membrane in alkaline medium. Fuel cell performance of the annealed membrane for alkaline DMFC was evaluated through single cell test. Pt-Ru/C was used as anode electrocatalyst, while Pt/C was used as cathode electrocatalyst. The electrolcatalyst inks were prepared by taking each catalysts in separate small glass beakers and adding 30 μl of 5 wt% Nafion perfluorinarted resin solution, along with 100 μl of water and 1 ml of isopropyl alcohol in each. Each beaker was sonicated till a fine ink was obtained. The prepared catalyst inks were coated on PTFE treated Toray carbon paper (from Sigma-Aldrich India) and loading of both anode and cathode electrocatalysts was kept at 2 mg/cm2. Thus prepared carbon paper diffusion layer supported electrocatlysts were dried at 80 °C for 6 h. The membrane electrode assembly (MEA) was prepared by sandwiching the membrane between anode and cathode electrocatalyst loaded carbon papers through hot press method using 100 °C temperature and 98 bar pressure for 10 min. The active surface area of the MEA was 6.25 cm2. It was fitted in a single cell, where anode compartment was fed with 3 M methanol + 2 M KOH solution at a flow rate of 5 ml/min flow rate, while cathode chamber was fed with pure oxygen at 25 sccm flow rate. The cell temperature was fixed at 60 °C and a manual fuel cell test station from K-PAS Instronic Engineers India Pvt Ltd was used for recording the cell voltage data."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Confirmation of presence of amino acids/peptides in HH by XPS and FTIR,"4.1 Confirmation of presence of amino acids/peptides in HH by XPS and FTIR Binding energy peaks corresponding to all the bonds in amino acids/ peptides are present in the XPS spectra of the HH (shown in Fig. 1 ) and verified with existing literature [38]. The carbon 1 s spectra (Fig. 1(a)) includes the peak for CC and CH bonds at binding energy 285 eV, the peak for CO and CN bonds is observed at 286.3 eV and N CO amide carbon bond peak is observed at 288.2 eV. The presence of nitrogen peaks in nitrogen 1 s spectra (Fig. 1(b)) confirms the existence of amino acids/ peptides in HH, where peaks at 398.8 eV, 400.2 eV and 401.8 eV corresponds to NC, N CO and NH binding energies respectively. Amide A, amide I, amide II and amide III peaks present in the FTIR spectra (Fig. 2 ) certifies the presence of protein/ peptides in the HH. All the characteristic bands of peptides, as indicated in existing literature, are present in the FTIR spectra of HH [39–42]. The band at 3286 cm−1 is the result of combination of NH (amide A) stretching and OH stretching, while the transmission bands at 1658 cm−1 and 1538 cm−1 are for CO stretching (amide I) and NH bending (amide II) respectively. The band at 1238 cm−1 is attributed to amide III (a combination of CN stretching and NH in-plane bending) and CC stretching and CO bending vibration. According to Bhimareddy et al. (2015) [40] the band at 1452 cm−1 corresponds to the π–π interactions in peptide. The higher energy band at 618 cm−1 is resulted due to the presence of CS bond, while a clear band around 470 cm−1, corresponding to the disulfide bond (SS) for undigested keratin, as reported in previous literature [42], is missing from the FTIR spectra shown in Fig. 2, indicating the complete cleavage of disulfide bonds. The presence of small bands at 1080 cm−1 and 1042 cm−1 is due to sulfate oxides, which might have formed during the cleavage of the disulfide bonds in keratin and their subsequent oxidation during thermal hydrolysis. The band at 2962 cm−1 corresponds to the CH stretching vibration."
8,Molecular weight analysis of HH,"4.2 Molecular weight analysis of HH Molecular weight of HH calculated by MALDI-TOF-MS (as shown in Fig. 3 ) for three different batches, displayed two different ranges of mass distribution, one is from lower molecular weight below 1 KDa to 7.5 KDa and the other is from 7.9 KDa to 15 KDa. The peak position for lower side molecular weight distribution varied between 1 and 2 KDa, while for the higher side molecular weight distribution, it is fixed around 7.9 KDa. Thus, it became clear that the hair keratin which generally has molecular weight in the range ≈ 44–66 KDa [43], was decomposed by thermal hydrolysis process and reduced to lower molecular weight range hydrolysate that can be easily dissolved in water."
9,Amino acid composition of HH:,"4.3 Amino acid composition of HH: The results for amino acid composition in the HH are shown in Table 1 indicates that in the HH approximately 70 wt% part is keratin protein. Around 27 wt% part of HH consists of charged amino acids (arginine, histidine, lysine, aspartate and glutamic acid) and approximately 19 wt% part consists of polar amino acids [44]. The presence of charged and ionizable hydrogen donor and acceptor species in amino acids helps in the ion conduction. Recently, Liu et al. (2020) [45], reported that a layer of protein nanowires worked as power generation unit by using only ambient moisture gradient across the layer as sole driving force, wherein the layers accept the charge from ionized water (H(H2O)n + /HO(H2O)n −), resulting in closed-loop current flow. Charged amino acids consists of both acidic and basic type and polar amino acids can be polarized by changing the pH, which indicates that proteins are capable of transferring both cationic and anionic species. Transfer of protons through proteins in biological systems (such as photosynthesis) is well known. While proton transport in processes like photosynthesis follows a very rigorous mechanism, the proton transport in enzymes involved for energy generation occurs through special proton conducting channels consisting of protonable groups of protein connected by water [24]. Stuchebrukhov (2009) [24] further described the proton transfer mechanism for three possible cases along the channel. In the first case where deficiency of water is observed in the channel, the proton transfer happens through localized charge, where water molecules carry the charges in the H3O+ or OH− form between hydrogen donor and acceptor groups of protein. In the second case, where a continuous chain is formed by water molecules inside the channel, the transfer occurs via thermally activated hopping of charge and partial hydrogen bonding and localized solvation reduces the activation barrier. In the third case, when water molecules form a chain of hydrogen bonds with strong coupling, the proton transfer becomes delocalized between donor and acceptor and transfer becomes much faster compare to other two cases. Similar kind of mechanism has been proposed by Chen et al. (2009) [46] for proton transfer in guanine-cytosine base pair. During high energy radiation positive holes and electrons are formed within the DNA. The holes transfer to guanine, while electron shifts to cytosine. To balance the charge, one proton gets transferred from another site of guanine to cytosine. This proton transfer in the absence of water is difficult, resulting in the damage of DNA strand due to excess of electron on cytosine, while the slight hydration allows the transfer of protons. In the event of bulk hydration charge transfer takes place by delocalization and the base pair captures extra electron due to ease of charge transfer, which can again result in DNA damage. Anion transport through protein is well known in red blood cell proteins called erythrocyte, which facilitates the exchange of Cl− for HCO3 − across the plasma membrane of the cell [47]. The red cell membrane shows quite high selectivity for anions in comparison to cations. It was assumed by Mond (1927) [48] that fixed positive charges lined in water filled channel in the membrane are the reason for the high selectivity of the red blood cell membrane. Selectivity of the anion permeability is regained by loading of OH− ions. Knauf (1979) [49] has provided a detailed review chapter on erythrocyte in which he has mentioned that a large number of substrates can be transported through the membrane which includes some exotic compounds such as spin labels, superoxide radical, cyclic nucleotides, carboxylic and sulfonic acids. So, such protein compounds can be used for OH− anion transport. Further, he has detailed the mechanism of anion transport which mainly includes simultaneous and ping-pong models. In the simultaneous model the anions combine with the system and then translocated simultaneously, while in ping-pong model one anion is combined and translocated before the other. These mechanisms are similar to currently known mechanisms like the surface hopping mechanism for H+ and OH− ions transport, which is site dependent and where charges hop through certain functional groups present in the ion conductive membranes by converting water in certain intermediate species and then translocating [50]. Knauf [49] also provided review on the nature of sites responsible for anion transfer in erythrocyte and concluded that the guanidino group is the most probable site of anion binding compare to other amine sites present in the protein. In general, the presence of quaternary ammonium derived functional groups in the polymer chains is well known for its use in AEMs [50]. But, use of guanidino group in anion transport can be an added advantage as it provides preferable anion binding site. As shown in amino acid analysis, approximate 7 wt% of HH contains arginine which possesses the guanidino functional group. Arginine as an anion transfer unit has advantages of two positive charge sites, one in form of guanidino group and other is amino group. Charge delocalization in guanidino group can further help in charge transfer and in the acidic medium as explained by Henry & Sykes (1995) [51], it gets easily protonated and deprotonated in water, making it suitable for proton transport in the cationic fuel cell membranes. The most important advantage of arginine is the stability of the guanidino group in the charged (protonated) form in a strong basic medium [52], which is known to be low for organic cations of the anionic fuel cell membranes in alkaline medium [53–55]. Thus, inclusion of HH in PVA membrane can provide anion transfer capability to the matrix through different cationic functionalities of amino acids present in it by following a hopping kind of mechanism, shown through the representative image in Fig. 4 ."
10,Crystallinity analysis and thermal stability of HH,"4.4 Crystallinity analysis and thermal stability of HH The crystal structure analysis of HH powder through XRD spectroscopy showed its crystalline nature. There are two crystalline peaks (Fig. 5 ), one is around 2θ = 9.7° for α-helix structure, which is very small and hardly recognizable and the second is around 2θ = 20° for β-sheet structure of peptides present in the HH [56]. The presence of amide I band around 1658 cm−1 in FTIR spectra indicates the presence of α-helix structure in the HH [57], which has been further supported by XRD results. Thermal stability of the HH can be observed from Fig. 6 (a). The differential thermogravimetric graph (DTG) shown in Fig. 6(a) shows four major weight loss zones. The weight loss below 150 °C can be attributed to removal of physically bound moisture to the sample. The second weight loss region in the temperature range of 150 °C to 350 °C is due to the decomposition of the β-sheet structure of the HH and a sharp weight loss peak just adjacent to the second weight loss peak is observed due to the decomposition of the α-helix structure. The final weight loss beyond 380 °C represents the pyrolysis of remaining material in the N2 atmosphere. With increasing temperature, there was hardly any crystallization and melting behavior observed by DSC analysis for the HH (Fig. 6(b)), and only a very small endothermic peak can be observed around 200 °C due to slight melting of crystals present. Beyond 200 °C, the material simply degrades, leaving behind around 10 wt% ash content."
11,Morphology of HH and PVA-HH membranes,"4.5 Morphology of HH and PVA-HH membranes The spherical shape nanoparticle morphology along with some micron size agglomerated nanoparticles of the HH (Fig. 7 (a)) matches with the morphology of keratein micro and nanoparticles reported in the literature [39,41–42]. To check the effect of crosslinker GA on HH, 10 mg of HH was dissolved in 1.5 ml of water and 100 μl of GA solution was added into it. One drop of the solution was taken on aluminum foil and drop casted by drying at 100 °C for 10 min and its FESEM images were taken. Fig. 7(b) shows that GA can crosslink the spherical HH nanoparticles to form a random chain morphology. In the background of the random chain morphology as shown in Fig. 7(b), the rest of the un-crosslinked HH particles can be seen prominently. PVA-1 wt% HH GA crosslinked membranes showed random morphology. As shown in Fig. 7(c), one part of the membrane depicts the presence of HH nanoparticles, globular shaped bigger particles of the HH nanoparticles, and rod shaped morphology can be observed in the background. In another part of the membrane (Fig. 7(d)), globular and cross shaped morphologies of the HH in the PVA matrix can be seen. While the globular morphology may be observed due to combining of several HH nanoparticles, the rod-shape morphology may be present due to combined effect of crosslinking and alignment of hydrophobic-hydrophilic sections of HH. The crosslinking gives the HH chain-like structure, at the same time hydrophobic zones of chains may align inwards as PVA is hydrophilic, forming a rod-like crystal morphology. The cross-shape morphology is formed by joining of hydrophilic ends of four such rods. The effect of alignment of hydrophobic-hydrophilic sections of the HH is clearly visible in the higher concentrations (5 wt% and 10 wt%) of HH. In case of PVA-5 wt% HH membrane (Fig. 7(e)), channel formation in the membrane by HH can be observed. Due to increased concentration, the HH forms separate channel-like sections, where it tries to bring hydrophobic parts together and align them on the inward side of the channels, while keeping the hydrophilic sections outwards and the PVA matrix lies in between two channels. Such micron size channels in the presence of water will provide a continuous path for charge transfer, reducing the charge transfer barrier. The magnified image (Fig. 7(f)) of the channels shows the presence of rod-like and flower-like morphology. As explained for PVA-1 wt% HH membrane, the rods are crystals formed by alignment of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts of the crosslinked HH chains. Due to higher concentration the rod-shape morphology is clearly visible in PVA-5 wt% HH membrane. While the flower shape morphology also can be contributed to increased concentration, where the hydrophilic ends of multiple small rods combined to form the flower morphology, similar to the formation of cross shape in previous case. This can be further verified from Fig. 7(i) where multiple rods combine together to form the flower shape and as edges of the rods touches each other, they create a hollow section in the center of the flower. The assumption of formation of rods by crystal formation through the arrangement of HH nanoparticles can also be verified through Fig. 7(j) in which very small to bigger size nanoparticles can be seen in the magnified image of flower shape morphology. As the concentration of HH is further increased to 10 wt% in PVA matrix, we can see the formation of even bigger rods and 3D flowers formation by smaller rods (Fig. 7(h)). But higher concentration also results in the formation of multiple flat agglomerated phase sections in the channels, as shown in parts of Fig. 7(g), as well as it blocks the gap between two channels, subsequently blocking the continuous path of charge transfer and resulting in higher resistance to charge transfer. The ion conductivity results agree with the morphological analysis results and they are discussed in the subsequent section. The overall mechanism of formation of different types of morphologies in different wt.% HH loadings in the PVA matrix membranes is explained in Fig. 8 ."
12,Thermal stability of PVA-HH membranes,"4.6 Thermal stability of PVA-HH membranes The thermal stability of base PVA-GA and its composite membrane with HH is shown in Fig. 9 . The base membrane depicted four weight loss regions in the DTG curve. The first weight loss region below 200 °C is common in all the membranes, which is observed due to evaporation of physically bound water to the samples. The second region between 230 °C and 330 °C is degradation region of amorphous part of PVA and the third region from 330 °C to 420 °C is observed due to decomposition of crystalline PVA. The final weight loss region beyond 420 °C is simple pyrolysis of remaining sample. After inclusion of HH in the PVA matrix there is not much change found in first and final weight loss regions, only the final weight loss started from a little lower temperature (400 °C-410 °C) for the composite membranes. The noticeable changes were observed in the second weight loss region, as the peak of second weight loss in DTG curve slowly disappeared with increasing the concentration of HH in the PVA matrix. It indicates that the HH crystals during formation of particular type of morphology such as rod shape and cross shape in 1 wt% HH loading and rod shape and flower shape in case of 5 wt% and 10 wt% HH loadings, tries to arrange the PVA chains along with them by interaction of their exterior hydrophilic sites with hydrophilic PVA chains to form a single phase. So, as the concentration of HH goes up the weight loss peak due to amorphous section was reduced continuously and it was completely merged to the third weight loss peak in 10 wt% HH loading, showing single weight loss zone in the temperature range 230 °C to 420 °C. Thus, it could be concluded that interaction between HH and PVA matrix improved the thermal stability of composite membranes in comparison to base PVA-GA membrane."
13,"Ionic conductivity, methanol permeability and selectivity of the PVA-HH membranes","4.7 Ionic conductivity, methanol permeability and selectivity of the PVA-HH membranes Hydroxyl ion conductivity was analyzed in the alkaline medium for the PVA-HH samples and the results are listed in Table 2 and a comparison was made with the base PVA membrane. The ionic conductivities of all the samples were increased with increase in the temperature. All the HH based samples showed at least a decimal order of magnitude higher ionic conductivity at all the temperatures, compared to the base membrane. As expected through the examination of morphological analysis, the best results for ionic conductivity (7.46 mS/cm at 70 °C) were observed for 5 wt% HH loading, where we could observe clear channel network for ion conduction in the membrane. While introduction of HH by adding 1 wt% into the PVA matrix improved the ionic conductivity, adding higher amount (10 wt%) resulted in the blocking of channel network and the increased crystal network increased the resistance to ion permeation, resulting in the reduction of ionic conductivity. By following the earlier reports [58,59], activation energies for ion transfer from one site to the next site was calculated from the slope of Arrhenius plots (Fig. 10 ). Due to absence of strong charge transfer cationic sites, base PVA membrane showed highest activation energy of 14.4 kJ/mol. As observed from the morphological analysis, 1 wt% HH loading sample had different HH morphologies distributed in the membrane randomly, it showed lower activation energy (7.8 kJ/mol). While in case of 5 wt% HH loaded sample, the alignment of hydrophilic–hydrophobic sections formed the channels and cationic sites are only available inside it, so ions can only move through the channels, thus, the activation energy was increased again for the 5 wt% HH sample to 12.8 kJ/mol. For 10 wt% HH sample due to increased concentration, there was no proper channel network and the formed flower and rod shape morphologies are distributed throughout the sample with having cationic charge transfer sites on the surface. Due to higher concentration and no strict path formation, 10 wt% HH sample showed the lowest activation energy requirement (6.7 kJ/mol). The pre-exponential factor for the 5 wt% sample was highest among all the samples, thus even having higher activation energy, it showed better ion conductivity. Effect of interaction between hydrophilic PVA matrix and HH (observed through TGA analysis) as well as increased crystal network content can be observed through methanol permeability data (Table 3 ). Increasing the content of HH resulted in the improvement of methanol barrier properties and 10 wt% HH loading sample showed lowest methanol diffusion coefficient (4.14 × 10−7 cm2/s). As per selectivity data, which is ration of ion conductivity to methanol permeability, 5 wt% HH loading sample showed the best results with a selectivity value of 6.14 × 103 S.s/cm3. The ionic conductivity of the membrane is lower compared to its counterpart reported in literature, which can be improved by separation of cationic amino acid and cationic charged peptide chains and use it for the membrane preparation."
14,Water uptake and % swelling of PVA-HH membranes,"4.8 Water uptake and % swelling of PVA-HH membranes Presence of water is important for the ionic conductivity of the membranes as it works as ion carrier and a continuous water channel helps in ion transport. But excessive water uptake is a problem for PVA based membranes as it creates excessive swelling, reducing the stability of the membranes. At the same time during cell reaction production of water will create a flooding problem. As it can be observed from Table 4 , the water uptake for PVA-GA membrane is quite high, which results in the high swelling%. Inclusion of the HH introduced crystalline network in the PVA matrix, resulting in a reduction of %swelling with increasing HH content. At the same time, the HH contains more hydrophilic functional groups, resulting in again increasing trend for water uptake. %swelling has reduced to 30% in comparison to 50% for base PVA membrane, but 30% swelling is still high. To reduce the %swelling further annealing was done for the 5 wt% HH loaded membrane samples at 120 °C. Annealing of polymers is well known process to improve the crystallinity, at the same time, as reported in literature [60] annealing of PVA improves the crosslinking. Both of these processes reduces the free volume available in the membranes. Reduced free volume reduces the water uptake as well as %swelling and increased crosslinking improves the thermal and thermo-mechanical properties. 5 wt% HH loaded PVA membrane sample was chosen for annealing based on its better ion conductivity and selectivity. The changes in various properties of the 5 wt% HH loaded PVA membrane sample due to annealing are discussed in the subsequent section."
15,Effect of annealing on the properties of PVA-5 wt% HH membrane and its alkaline stability,"4.9 Effect of annealing on the properties of PVA-5 wt% HH membrane and its alkaline stability Annealing of the membrane results in the crystallization of PVA matrix as well as improvement in the crosslinking which affects all the properties of membrane related to an AEM. Increase in the crystallinity of the membrane due to annealing can be observed through XRD spectra shown in Fig. 11 . The peak around 2θ = 20° showed drastic increase in the intensity which is combined peak of β-sheet structure of peptides present in the HH and PVA (101) crystal plane. The other PVA peaks around 2θ = 23° and 41° for crystal planes (200) and (102) did not change much, indicating that (101) is the main crystal plane formed in the matrix. Slight improvement in the crystallinity due to α-helix structure of HH was also observed, which is visible from slight increased intensity of α-helix band around 9.7°. Crystallization of the membrane had very significant effect on the mechanical and thermo-mechanical stability. From Table 5 , we can clearly observe that due to annealing the tensile strength of the membrane was enhanced significantly (more than 200%). At the same time, %elongation at break was reduced from around 129.3% to 14.6%, indicating that the membrane has lost its plastic nature significantly and it is mechanically more stable after annealing. Thermo-mechanical stability showed drastic improvement as storage modulus (E′) was increased from around 1800 MPa for before annealed sample to around 6800 MPa for annealed sample at 25 °C and it remained around 950 MPa at 100 °C for the annealed sample, while for before annealed sample it reduced to around 100 MPa (Fig. 12 ), showing the impact of increased crosslinking. Reduction in elongation due to increased crystallinity can also be detected through DMA analysis, as shown in Fig. 12, where under continuous force of 1 N during sample run, the total elongation observed for before annealed sample having initial sample length of 10 mm, is around 2.70 mm, while after annealing it is observed to be around 1.45 mm. Hydrolytic stability analysis of the annealed sample after keeping it in the water at 70 °C for 72 h, showed that the annealed membrane is stable in water, as the observed average weight loss for the membrane was below 0.4 wt%. Uncrosslinked HH in the membrane could be the reason for minute weight loss. Thermal stability of the base matrix did not change much by annealing, only the small peak for degradation of amorphous part of PVA present before annealing in the temperature range 230 °C-330 °C, completely merged in the thermal degradation peak of crystalline PVA (Fig. 13 ). A noticeable change was found in the weight loss region due to evaporation of bound moisture, where weight loss started around 30 °C in the membrane sample before annealing, while after annealing it got delayed and started around 85 °C. It showed the increased capability of the membrane sample to trap the water molecules in between crystals and keep it bound tightly till 85 °C. Another noticeable thing is weight loss due to evaporation of trapped water, which is around 10 wt% before annealing and after annealing it was reduced to 4 wt%, confirming the reduction in water uptake of membrane and it was also supported by water uptake data shown in Table 5. Increment in crystallinity improves the barrier properties, which is quite indicative by both methanol permeability as well as ionic conductivity data shown in the Table 5. Increased crystallinity increased the barrier for charge transfer, resulting in the reduction in the ionic conductivity of the annealed membrane sample by more than 1 mS/cm. At the same time, it also improved the methanol barrier property of the sample by reducing the methanol permeability to almost one decimal place, subsequently increasing the selectivity of the membrane. Annealing had impact on the water uptake and %swelling as well. A reduction of around 100% (from 144% to 40%) in water uptake was observed. While presence of 40 wt% of water with respect to dried membrane is more than enough for ion conduction, the lower water uptake had a positive effect on %swelling which reduced from 30% to 15% (Table 5). Thus, to conclude the effect of annealing on the properties of PVA-5 wt% HH composite membrane, there is only one negative point, that is reduction in ionic conductivity, while all the other properties related to AEMs improved, which includes improvement in thermal, thermo-mechanical, water uptake, %swelling, methanol permeability and selectivity. The annealed sample was also tested for the alkaline stability by keeping it in 0.5 M KOH solution for the 10 days. After 10 days the calculated ionic conductivity was found to be 6.09 ± 0.26 mS/ cm at 70 °C. It shows very small reduction from the initial ionic conductivity (6.16 ± 0.23), indicating the high stability of the HH based membrane in alkaline medium."
16,Fuel cell performance,"4.10 Fuel cell performance Performance of the PVA-HH based membrane for alkaline DMFCs was obtained through single cell analysis. Due to its stable nature and better ionic conductivity, annealed PVA-5 wt% HH membrane was used for analysis and the results obtained for it are shown here through the polarization curve and power density curve in Fig. 14 . The open circuit voltage (OCV) of the single cell was observed to be around 0.74 V. The effect of activation losses, ohmic losses and mass transport losses is clearly visible in the polarization curve. Maximum power density was observed to be around 12.1 mW/cm2 at the current density of 33.6 mA/cm2 for 3 M methanol + 2 M KOH solution and pure oxygen as oxidant. The fuel cell performance results obtained for the annealed membrane sample clearly shows its applicability for alkaline DMFC."
17,Conclusion,"The HH obtained by simple and green thermal hydrolysis of human hair bio-waste containing 70 wt% of proteinaceous material, has been successfully utilized as an ion conductive material in the PVA matrix with GA as crosslinking agent. Molecular weight obtained by MALDI-TOF-MS analysis showed two different ranges of molecular weight distribution, one is in lower molecular weight range, having distribution peak in the range of 1–2 KDa, while another one was distributed in the range of 7.9–15 KDa. Thus, it contained small amino acid chains to peptides to small size protein chains. FTIR and XRD analysis confirmed the presence of both α-helix and β-sheet structure in the HH. Presence of 27 wt% of charged amino acids and 19 wt% of polarizable amino acids in the HH helped in providing the charge transfer functionalities. Further, the presence of 7 wt% arginine in the HH, which has a continuous delocalized net positive charge in the guanidino group (the same group which works as anion binding site in red blood cells), may make the composite membranes stable in highly alkaline conditions. This was verified by indirect method of alkaline stability test, by ionic conductivity analysis, which showed the high stability of HH based membrane in alkaline medium. The HH formed rod and flower shape morphology by aligning its hydrophobic parts inward and hydrophilic parts outward which interacted with hydrophilic PVA matrix. The interaction between hydrophilic sections of both materials improved the thermal stability of the membrane, as with the continuous increase in the loading of HH decreased the weight loss peak due to degradation of the amorphous phase of PVA. Moreover, the HH crystals formed a channel-like continuous network, which in presence of water and alkaline medium provided a straight path for ion transfer and ion conductivity of around 7.46 mS/cm at 70 °C was obtained for 5 wt% loading of the HH in PVA matrix. Higher loadings generated more amount of crystals resulting in blockage of the channels and subsequent reduction in ionic conductivity. Thus, 5 wt% loading was considered to be optimum loading for ionic conductivity. To overcome the issues of high water uptake and swelling, annealing of the 5 wt% HH loaded samples was done at 120 °C for 3 h. The annealing resulted in the improvement of crystallinity of the sample which in turn improved the mechanical and thermo-mechanical stability of the membrane. Annealing also resulted in a drastic reduction in water uptake (almost 100%), which helped in reduction of %swelling from 30% to 15%. Increased crystallinity had impact on the barrier properties as well, as ionic conductivity was reduced to 6.16 mS/cm at 70 °C due to increased barrier for charge transfer. At the same time methanol permeation was reduced to almost one decimal place, helping in improving the selectivity of the membrane from 6.14 × 103 to 6.00 × 104 at 30 °C. The indirect method to check the stability of the membrane by change in ionic conductivity after keeping the sample in KOH solution for 10 days, showed small reduction in conductivity, indicating the high stability of the membrane. Single cell performance of the annealed membranes for alkaline DMFC showed acceptable results. Thus, it can be concluded that the HH, which is a cheap material, obtained from human hair bio-waste can work as anion conductive material and its inclusion in the PVA matrix showed promising results for its utilization as AEM in alkaline fuel cells. Lower ion conductivity of the current HH based membranes can be further improved by simple separation of cationic type of amino acid and cationic charged peptide chains from HH and utilized it for membrane preparation, as well as by reducing their crystallization in the membrane. Subsequent investigations on it as well as studies on ion transport mechanism in such materials will provide better insight and provide the path for further improvement in the properties of AEM."
