0,Introduction,"Reducing the negative environmental impacts caused by human activities is nowadays a central issue in the politics of international countries associations and several individual states. Particularly worrying are the consequences of the greenhouse effect to climate changing with important repercussions for the environment, economy, and human life. Most of the principal greenhouse effect gases, i.e. nitrogen oxides (NxOy), carbon dioxide (CO2) and sulfur oxides (SOx), are mainly produced by the combustion of fossil resources such as carbon, petroleum, or natural gas, and the reduction of their emissions is increasingly compulsory. One way to limit the emissions of greenhouse gases is the substitution of technologies based on the combustion of the fossil resources by free emission technologies, for instance, solar cells and wind power, or even fuel cells (FC) when the fuel used in them is obtained from renewable resources. Solar cells and wind power are already being used in many countries to produce electricity, and the demand of these technologies are thus increasing continuously around the world. On other hand, fuel cells can achieve high efficiencies, being their use possible in mobile and stationary applications [1]. A future predictable application of fuel cells is in the transportation sector and if vastly employed, it will definitely contribute to the reduction of exhaust gases emissions if the fuel used in them is produced in renewable mode. The most promising fuel cells in the transportation sector are the proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC), which usually use hydrogen as fuel. This chemical species is nowadays habitually produced in a non-renewable mode from the reforming of fossil resources like natural gas [2,3] but it can be also produced in a renewable mode, for instance, through the reforming of light alcohols, such as methanol or ethanol [4–6]. The latter are usually produced by biomass fermentation or gasification [3,7–9]. Methanol is also obtained through the synthetic gas (Syngas) process (see eq. (1)) but this reaction consumes hydrogen being consequently not adequate to produce methanol with the aim of obtaining hydrogen through its reforming [10]. (1) CO (g) + 2H2 (g) → CH3OH (g) The reforming of hydrocarbons or alcohols is not an unique chemical process, in fact, there are several modalities of reforming according to the type of reaction carried out such as, for instance, those named steam reforming (SR), partial oxidation (POX) and oxidative steam or autothermal reforming (OSR; ATR) [2]. As an example of the industrial importance of reforming processes, the catalytic reforming is widely used in the refinement of naphthas distilled from crude oil to obtain gasoline with high octane concentration. Coming back to the reforming options just mentioned, steam reforming is based on the reaction of a hydrocarbon or alcohol with steam on a solid catalyst. This process is usually endothermic and thus requires a heat source but on the other hand, it gives a hydrogen fluent with a high H2/CO ratio [2], which is a very important feature for its use as fuel in PEMFC. Notice that CO poisons the platinum catalyst used in the PEMFC even at extremely low (ppm level) concentrations [11]. Further, in the partial oxidation process, the hydrocarbon or alcohol is partially oxidized by O2, producing H2 and CO with a molar ration from 1:1 to 2:1 and therefore, this technology is not adequate for the production of hydrogen for PEMFC due to the high CO contents in the hydrogen effluent [2]. Reforming by partial oxidation is usually an exothermic process where the catalyst is not always necessary and the steam is not present in the reaction medium [2]. Both technologies (SR and POX) are combined in the oxidative steam reforming process. That is, O2 is added to the SR mixture leading to the production of a hydrogen effluent with high H2/CO ratio followed by an almost thermoneutral process, since the heat produced in the POX part is used in the SR one. This represents a theoretical advantage because the practical implementation of this technique is expensive due to the fact that O2 has to be supplied pure to avoid dilution of H2 in the effluent by the inert N2 [2]. Therefore, at industrial level, the steam reforming technique is the most appropriate one to produce H2 to be consumed in PEMFC. Reforming processes produce mainly H2 and CO (or CO2 on some catalysts) but also other byproducts like carbon (coke), which is deposited on the reforming catalyst poisoning it avoiding the catalysis of alcohol or hydrocarbon decomposition [2]. Methane (CH4) can be also produced on some reforming catalysts by the Syngas process, especially on those based on Ni, reducing the H2 amounts delivered (see eq. (1)). As stated before, the production of CO during the reforming process has to be avoided when the goal is to gather hydrogen for PEMFC [11]. This can be done by utilizing reforming catalysts that lead directly to the CO2 formation [12–14] or by the transformation of CO into CO2 through processes like the direct CO oxidation or the Water Gas Shift reaction (WGS, CO + H2O → CO2+ H2). Note that, the latter reaction not only transforms the CO into CO2 but it increases as well the hydrogen content of the effluent allowing the use of reforming catalysts with less selectivity towards CO2 [2]. Here it has to be recalled that, at industrial level nowadays, hydrogen is mostly produced by steam reforming (SR) of methane (approximately 95% of natural gas is methane) at high temperatures (>800 °C), producing also carbon monoxide (CO) [2,3] which is frequently eliminated through the WGS or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) [11,15–17]. Despite that, hydrogen can be also produced in renewable mode through the steam reforming of light alcohols like methanol or ethanol [4,6], these chemical species are being obtained by fermentation of biomass or sugar [3,7–9]. Indeed, the methanol SR requires lower temperatures and pressures than the SR of methane, usually 250-350 °C and 1–5 MPa, making it clearly an alternative source to methane for H2 production [3]. This work presents a systematic and critical survey of the advances in the catalysts for the reforming of light alcohols with the aim of hydrogen production. It is especially remarkable the increase of their thermal stability or the lower selectivity toward undesirable byproducts as CO, CH4 or carbon (coke) achieved by the addition of adequate dopants to the catalyst active phase. Therefore, the published works chosen for this review are those aiming at the improvement of reforming catalysts for hydrogen production from light alcohols through the formation of multicomponent active phases. Special attention is paid to theoretical works focused on that topic. In fact, the catalysts used in the methanol SR reforming have experienced a continuous evolution during the last decades to avoid problems, such as the catalyst poison by coke, the CO and CH4 formation or the lack of catalyst stability. The first catalysts probed in the methanol SR were based on pure copper, but they are pyrophoric and suffer of fast sintering [18]. A better thermal stability and selectivity towards hydrogen has nevertheless been achieved using a PdZn-based catalyst but its activity is lower than that of copper-based catalysts [19,20]. The PdZn-based catalysts activity was further increased up than that of Cu-based catalysts, holding the high thermal stability of the former [21–23]. Anyhow, Cu and PdZn based catalysts led to considerable CO, CH4 or coke formation, decreasing therefore the H2 yields by the poison of the reforming catalyst by coke or by the formation of CH4 which consumes hydrogen. Moreover, a hydrogen effluent with even lower CO concentrations is not adequate to be used in PEMFC [11]. The selectivity and activity of methanol reforming catalysts have been really increased by considering catalysts with an active phase composed of a bimetal (one of them a noble metal) supported on an oxide, such as: Au–Ru/Fe2O3, Au–Cu/TiO2, Au–Pd/ZnO [24–27] or Pd–Cu/ZnAl2O4 [28] catalysts. All these catalysts are more active and less selective towards CO, CH4 or coke formation than the correspondent monometallic catalysts. For instance, the methanol conversion over Au–Cu/TiO2 catalyst reaches almost the 100% of H2 selectivity (not methane formation) at high temperature while CO selectivity is below 20% [25]. On Au–Ru/Fe2O3 catalyst the full conversion of methanol is obtained at 523 K while the maximum hydrogen selectivity is achieved at 553 K (92%); CO selectivity is over 20% for all the range of temperatures studied [26]. Further, the methanol conversion reaches the 99.5% on Au–Pd/ZnO catalyst at 573 K with a hydrogen selectivity of 65.6% and a CO selectivity lower than 5%. Different reasons have been given for the better performance of these bimetallic catalysts with respect to the monometallic counterpart ones, namely: in the case of gold based catalysts that was related with the lower particle size of the active phase of bimetallic catalysts compared to that of monometallic ones, thus contributing to a more effective stabilization of reactants in the surfaces of the catalysts [24–27]. In the case of Pd–Cu/ZnAl2O4 catalysts, their better performance was attributed to the formation of the alloy that presents a different reactivity than the isolated pure components [28]. Additional experiments have been carried out to test alternative bimetallic catalysts for the methanol SR, namely those based on: (i) Ni–Al/layered-double-hydroxide precursor [29] where the products selectivity largely depends on the calcination temperature of the precursor (methanol conversion about 100%, hydrogen selectivity ~50%, CH4 selectivity in the range of 20%–50% and CO selectivity ~5% at 673 K for all the catalysts tested), (ii) Zn–Cu/CeO2 that presents lower selectivity, especially at low temperature, towards CO (<0.5% at 230 °C) which is formed by the reverse WGS reaction [30], or (iii) the Ga–Pd/Gallia that presents a better CO2 selectivity (CO selectivity of 100% for monometallic catalyst and lower values for Ga-doped catalysts depending on the Ga content), since the latter is opposite to CO selectivity, than the monometallic Pd/Al2O3 catalyst [31]. Metal (or bimetallic) nanoparticles dispersed on a support, usually an oxide, is not the unique scheme for methanol steam reforming catalysts, in fact, there are catalysts where the active phase comprises a combination of oxides or a mixed oxide. Within these, Zhang et al., [32] studied the methanol steam reforming on La2CuO4/CuZnAl-oxides obtaining that this catalyst presents a lower CO selectivity (0.2%–0.5% points lower at 250–300 °C) and a higher H2 selectivity (1%–2% point higher at 250–300 °C) than the commercial CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst which it is related with the synergic effects between La2CuO4 and CuZnAl oxides. On the other hand, the addition of ZrO2 oxide to CuOZnOxGa2O3 increases its activity and stability for methanol steam reforming by increasing the catalyst surface area and by modification of the catalyst's reducibility [33]. This catalyst presents a high H2 selectivity, not coke formation and a CO selectivity lower than 0.3% mol at 523 K, being the CO formed by reverse WGS reaction [33]. Moreover, the support can have also an important role in the catalysis of methanol reforming, for instance, in Cu/CeO2 [34,35] and Ni/CeO2 [36] catalysts where the improved performance for that reaction was explained by a synergic effect between the metal and the ceria oxide. Even, not supported catalysts as La2CuO4 crystal nanofibers can be used for the catalysis of the MSR with success, obtaining H2 without detection of CO byproduct at temperature below 300 °C [37]. Moreover, the catalysts activity can also be modified by other non-structural factors such as, for example, the irradiation with microwaves in the case of the CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst [38]. Methanol steam reforming does not occur always as an isolated reaction, being also part of more complex processes as dimethyl ether steam reforming where its occurs after the dimethyl ether hydrolysis [39]. This process is catalyzed, for instance, by V–Ni/Al2O3 catalyst which avoid the deposition of coke and the formation of methane at high temperature [39]. Overall, it can be concluded that the catalyst activity for the methanol steam reforming and catalyst stability can be altered by modifying its structure through the addition of other components to the active phase or even by the change of the catalyst support. Among the large series of catalysts tested during the last decade for the methanol steam reforming, it is clear that Ru is the most reactive metal and its combination with other metals like Pt (Pt–Ru) or Rh (Rh–Ru) leads to very active catalysts [13,40]. Nevertheless, the latter metals are extremely expensive and, in some cases, rare, thus precluding their use for the elaboration of industrial catalysts. As such, catalysts based on less expensive metals like Ni or Cu have been developed for the methanol SR. The combination of both metals affords a bimetallic (Ni–Cu) catalyst that, despite its less activity, provides a better selectivity towards CO2 than e.g. Ru–Rh as well as being of course less expensive [40]. The hydrogen yields obtained with the bimetallic Ni–Cu catalyst can be substantially increased by the use of membranes to separate the CO and CO2 gases from H2, especially those based on the Pd–Ag alloy, [40]. The structure and composition of the support affect the activity and selectivity of the bimetallic Ni–Cu catalyst as well. For instance, different dopants of the ZrO2 support give rise to different reactivity's, the Ce being the most suitable dopant for the hydrogen production on the Ni–Cu/ZrO2 catalyst (hydrogen selectivity over 99.5% for all the catalysts tested) [41]. In addition, supports with surfaces comprising amorphous ZrO2 oxide shells enhance the reactivity of the Ni–Cu catalyst compared to other structures of that oxide with higher grade of crystallinity; this being mainly due to the higher presence of active sites for the water adsorption on the amorphous phase [14]. The experimental conditions employed during the support preparation can further influence the activity of the catalysts. For example, when the bimetallic Ni–Cu catalyst supported by CaO–SiO2 is prepared under specific conditions, a high specific surface area to disperse the bimetallic nanoparticles can be attained and that leads to a higher catalyst reactivity (95% mol of hydrogen selectivity at 250 °C) [42]. Further, the structural characteristics that make the bimetallic Ni–Cu catalyst more reactive and stable than the correspondent monometallic Cu catalyst have been studied at microscopic level by several authors [43,44]. The authors have concluded that the Ni/Cu ratio is a crucial aspect to determine its activity and selectivity [14,43]. In fact, high Ni contents in the catalyst favor the methanol decomposition towards CO (not suitable to be used in PEMFC) while high Cu contents favor the WGS reaction that produces CO2 (plus H2 in both cases) reducing the CO amounts to values between 0.7% and 5.3% depending on the experiment temperature [12,45]. What is more, methane formation has not been detected for this bimetallic catalyst [45]. On the other hand, ethanol reforming also produces hydrogen and this compound is less toxic than methanol but it has the disadvantage that its C─C bond is difficult to cleave [4–6]. The break of this bond needs more reactive reforming catalysts and higher temperatures (typically > 450 °C) than in the reforming of methanol [7]. As in the case of methanol, ethanol reforming had been tested in large series of catalysts based on a metal dispersed on a support, such as Rh/CexZr1-xO2 [46], Ir/CeO2 [47], Cu/Nb2O5 [48], Ni/MgO [49], Co/ZnO [50], Ni/Al2O3 [48], Co/MgO [49], Pt, Rh, Pd on Al2O3 [51], etc. Taking into account both the activity and the associated costs, the catalysts based on Co and Ni seem to be the most appropriated for the ethanol reforming [49–55]. The Co-based catalysts activity and selectivity for ethanol reforming can be improved by adding dopants atoms from more reactive metals like Rh, giving rise to a bimetallic Rh–Co catalyst that presents a higher H2 and lower CO (close to 0%) and CH4 selectivity's [56,57]. The role of Rh in such bimetallic catalyst is related to an increase of its activity for the C─C bond break in Rh sites as so as in Co sites [56]. Moreover, the addition of Pt to Co-based catalysts enhances the catalyst activity for the ethanol steam reforming [58] and for other reactions like the ethanol oxidation [59]. As in the case of the Rh dopant, the role of Pt in ethanol SR is related to an increase in the catalyst activity for the C─C bond break, decreasing at the same time the catalyst selectivity towards coke, CO (<2%) and CH4 (<4%) [58]. Dopants as Mn or Fe also increase the activity of Co based catalysts for the ethanol steam reforming, but the role of these dopants is instead related with the enhancement of the Co reducibility by the formation of bimetallic nanoparticles [60]. The combination of both cheap metals, Co and Ni, leads to a bimetallic Co–Ni catalyst which produces H2 with a purity up 99% while low CO (0.1% mol) and CH4 (0.4% mol) selectivity's are obtained [61]. On the other hand, Ni-based catalysts can be doped with other metals such as Cu, which enhances the catalyst activity for the C─C bond break and facilitates the ethanol dehydrogenation towards H2, with CO selectivity close to zero for some catalysts and, H2/CH4 selectivity's about 60%/10% depending on the reaction temperature [62,63]. Similar products selectivity's (65% for H2 and <1% for CO) are also obtained when the catalyst is formed by Ni embedded in mesoporous carbon, favoring this catalyst structure the WGS reaction which converts CO to CO2 and additional hydrogen [64]. Other dopants as Re [65] or Ce [66] were also added to Ni based catalysts and achieved good performance for reforming reactions; Re favors the dispersion of Ni nanoparticles through preventing their sintering and improves the coke resistance of the catalyst during the biomass reforming while CeO2 interacts with Ni enhancing the catalyst activity for ethanol steam reforming. Combinations of most reactive metals for reforming of alcohols such as Pt, Ru, Pd, Rh provide very reactive bimetallic catalysts but the cost of these metals prohibits their employment in industry if high quantities are necessary, and therefore, catalysts based on Co and Ni are still the most promising ones for the ethanol steam reforming. Among the bimetallic catalysts for ethanol steam reforming developed with expensive metals, the PtRu/ZrO2 [67] gives low CO yields and the RhPd/CeO2 catalyst coated on a monolithic silicon microreactor [4] presents a high H2 selectivity. Monometallic Pt, Rh or Pd/Al2O3 promoted with Ca also present a high reactivity for the ethanol SR, that being related to their catalyst ability for breaking the C─C bond [51]. Metal nanoparticles dispersed on a support is not the unique scheme possible for designing catalysts for ethanol SR. In fact, combination of several oxides as NiO/ZnO/ZrO2 can be also active for the catalysis of this reaction, producing a hydrogen fluent almost free of methane (CO selectivity close to 0% at low temperature but increasing up 20% at high temperature) and making stable the catalyst for a longer time [68]. Further, NiO/La2Sn2O7 catalyst is also high active for the ethanol steam reforming but it produces considerable amounts of undesirable products such as CO or CH4 and therefore it is not suitable for hydrogen production to be used in FCs [69]. Mixed oxides such as LaNiOx [70], Y2Ce2-xRuxO7-δ (x = 0–0.4) [71] or La2Ce1·8Ru0·2O7 [72] are also high reactive for the ethanol reforming; the later reaches a 99% of ethanol conversion at ~325 °C and a 70% of H2 selectivity while the Y2Ce2-xRuxO7-δ and LaNiOx reach hydrogen selectivity's of 84% and ~70%, respectively. Moreover, Co oxides also present a considerable capacity for the ethanol steam reforming catalysis, with selectivity lower than 2% for CO and lower than 0.8% for methane while the catalyst activity is maximum at 375 °C [73]. Metallic cobalt and CoO oxide can coexist in the catalyst active phase after the reduction of the spinel cobalt oxide, being both responsible for the catalytic activity [74]. Oxides can also act as catalytic promoters for the ethanol steam reforming, as in the case of Rh supported on Ca–Al2O3, ZrO2 or MgO where the addition of Fe2O3 oxide is able to block the CO formation on Rh/Ca–Al2O3 catalyst but on the other hand, CH4 selectivity is of 39.7% [75]. For Rh/MgO and Rh/ZrO2 catalysts the promotion by Fe2O3 is less effective increasing even the CO amounts in the case of Rh/ZrO2 catalyst [75]. For these catalysts the interaction between Rh/Fe2O3 and the support plays a crucial role in the availability of active sites for the ethanol steam reforming without CO production; moderate support and iron oxide interactions favor the formation of Rh/FexOy sites which are the responsible for the CO-free ethanol steam reforming [75]. In a similar fashion, Gonçalves et al. [76] added TiO2 oxide to the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst resulting in a higher CO2/CO ratio and formation of less stable coke, related to the variation of the support acidity by the addition of TiO2 oxide. Even though the composition and structure of the active phase are usually the decisive catalyst’ features to establish its activity and selectivity for ethanol SR, the support’ role cannot be ignored. Indeed, the support interacts with the activity phase governing the dispersion of the nanoparticles’ active phase or causing synergic effects that modify the catalyst performance [77,78]. Moreover, the catalyst structure and composition is not the unique aspect determining the catalytic activity of the reforming reactor, in fact, parameters as the reactants pressures, reaction temperature and reactants feed ratios also influence the products selectivity's in the hydrogen production from acetone-butanol-ethanol water mixture [79]."
1,Results and discussion. Study of hydrogen production from light alcohols reforming on multicomponent catalysts: General aspects and applicability of computational methods,"As seen, the enhancement of the catalysts activity and selectivity towards H2 from methanol or ethanol reforming is usually achieved by adding extra components to the catalyst active phase, i.e., to become multicomponent catalysts [24–28,56–58,64–67]. Other factors such as the support or catalyst preparation method and pretreatment can also alter the catalyst activity or selectivity [34–38,77,78]. Therefore, the crucial aspects in the improvement of the catalysts for light alcohols reforming are the catalyst composition and morphology. It is special noticeable that the dependence of the catalyst activity with the nanoparticle size of the active phase [24–27], which at microscopic level is related to the presence of surface defects where low coordinated atoms are present. But as it can be corroborated through the comparison of the CO, CH4, coke and H2 selectivity's for the ethanol or methanol reforming on multicomponent catalysts (see Introduction section), the catalysts obtained during the last years have limitations yet. Indeed, despite the considerable improvement gather by addition of extra component to catalysts active phases or supports their CO selectivity does not usually reach the ppm level required to be used in the hydrogen production for FCs. Further, the majority of studies are focused on increasing the catalyst stability, H2 yields or on decreasing the CO, CH4 or coke selectivity's separately, but a catalyst with long time stability, high alcohol conversion, high H2 and low CO, CH4, coke selectivity's at the same time is desirable. In this section, we will mainly analyze the theoretical methods normally employed in the study of the hydrogen production by light alcohols reforming since these may help in the improvement of the catalysts, along with the procedures used in the catalysis of such chemical process. Most theoretical methods used in this field are based on quantum mechanics and within those, Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods are the most common because they permit the study of the adsorption of reactants along with the reactivity on the catalytic surfaces with a reasonable computational cost [80]. The results obtained then enable us to gather information about the effects in the catalyst reactivity of the morphology of its active sites and composition, plus species coverage or reaction conditions [80]. Moreover, adsorption and reaction energies as well as rate constants can be derived from the data obtained with computational methods like DFT, thus allowing one to infer the reaction mechanism with the possible different products and byproducts formed [80]. The information about the reaction mechanism or different sites reactivity can be further used to improve the catalyst studied and even to predict the reactivity of other catalysts by resorting to promising general relationships derived [81–83]."
2,Quantum mechanics calculations: ethanol reforming studies by DFT,"2.1 Quantum mechanics calculations: ethanol reforming studies by DFT As referred to above, DFT methods tend to be the most applied in theoretical studies with the aim of improving the H2 production by reforming of light alcohols. In fact, these methods have been extensively used in those type of studies by resorting to extended surfaces to model the catalysts faces. The surfaces used in the majority of these DFT studies correspond to metals among those considered the most reactive for the reforming of alcohols like Rh, Co or Pt and which constitute the active phase of the reforming catalysts [84–88]. Within the DFT studies for the ethanol reforming, the oxygen steam reforming of ethanol on Rh(111) surface has been investigated by Syu et al. [84] through periodic DFT calculations along with plane waves to describe the catalytic system. Their results show that the ethanol decomposition starts with the O─H bond break to form ethoxide adsorbed on this surface (see scheme of Fig. 1 for general reaction paths for oxidative ethanol steam reforming; this scheme was generated putting together all the reaction steps given in literature). Following to the ethoxide formation, the ethanol decomposition evolves through the α or β ethoxide dehydrogenation on the Rh(111) surface which generates the key intermediaries, that is, acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) and oxametallacycle (CH2CH2O) species [84]. Both species decompose easily on the surface into carbon (C*), surface methylidyne (CH*) and carbon monoxide (CO*) which oxidations towards CO2 are the rate determining steps of the global process [84]. The oxidation of these species can be accelerated if oxygen is present on the surface, suggesting that the use of promoters that increase the surface oxygen concentration accelerates the OSR on the system studied [84]. Further, a stepped rhodium surface, the Rh(211) surface, was used by Zhang et al. [85] to study, also through DFT calculations, the ethanol steam reforming on rhodium catalysts. In this case, the SR evolves through the acetaldehyde intermediary, that is, the ethanol adsorbs on the Rh(211) surface losing the hydrogen joined to the oxygen which produces adsorbed ethoxide that is then dehydrogenated to acetaldehyde [85]. The latter species decomposes to acetyl and then acetyl to CO, which reacts with water (water gas shift reaction) to produce CO2 and H2 (see scheme of Fig. 2 for general reaction paths for ethanol steam reforming; this scheme was generated putting together all the reaction steps given in literature). The final step (WGS) is considered to be the rate determining step of the global SR process on this surface [85]. Therefore, a way to increase the Rh-based catalysts performance for the ethanol SR is to improve their activity forward the WGS reaction catalysis [85]. The reforming processes studied in Ref. [84] (OSR) and Ref. [85] (SR), despite being different processes, have in common the alcohol decomposition part. That is, the steps up reaching the formation of the CO are the same in both processes (cf. schemes in Figs. 1 and 2). After taking place the decomposition of the alcohol, in the SR process, CO reacts with steam to produce CO2 and H2 (WGS reaction) while, in the OSR, CO is oxidized by the O atoms on the surface and H2 is produced only by H atoms recombination. Therefore, considering that the methodologies used in Refs. [84] and Ref. [85] are equivalent (see Table 1 ), a measure of the effect of the low coordinated atoms in the catalysis of ethanol decomposition by rhodium can be done by direct comparison of the energetic quantities for common steps in OSR on Rh(111) and SR on Rh(211). The first step of the ethanol decomposition in both surfaces is the alcohol dehydrogenation towards ethoxide and this is characterized by an energy barrier of 0.32 eV on Rh(211) and 0.59 eV on Rh(111). The ethoxide decomposition can be followed by α- or β-dehydrogenations that produces acetaldehyde and oxametallacycle, respectively. The α-dehydrogenation is characterized by an energy barrier of 0.95 eV on Rh(111) and 0.69 eV on Rh(211) while the β-dehydrogenation presents energy barriers of 0.55 eV on Rh(111) and 0.97 eV on Rh(211). Following the decomposition sequence, the acetaldehyde α-dehydrogenation towards acetyl has an energy barrier of 0.09 eV on Rh(111) and 0.19 eV on Rh(211), etc. [84,85]. Therefore, when one compares the barriers for the common steps in both surfaces, a clearer trend cannot be found, suggesting that the ethanol decomposition on Rh surfaces is not a structure sensitive reaction. The ethanol SR has been theoretically studied as well on catalysts from other metals like platinum. For example, Sutton et al. [86] used the Pt(111) surface to represent a flat platinum catalyst face and the obtained DFT data were further used in a microkinetic analysis of the global process. The kinetic analysis of the global reforming process indicated that the ethanol steam reforming occurs on this surface through the thermal decomposition of the alcohol towards CO, followed by the WGS reaction which generates CO2 and H2 [86]. The microkinetic analysis results agreed well with the experiments carried out in the same work, confirming the reliability of computational methods for the study of ethanol reforming [86]. Moreover, the ethanol decomposition on Pt(111) starts with the ethanol adsorption on the surface followed by its α-dehydrogenation which produces CH3CHOH adsorbed on the surface. The later species evolves towards acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) by the break of its O─H bond on the surface or towards CH3COH by a new α-dehydrogenation, being the last species the most probably intermediary of both [86]. Further, acetyl (CH3CO) is formed from the CH3COH dehydrogenation on the catalyst through the O─H bond break. Furthermore, the acetyl suffers two consecutive dehydrogenations producing ketenyl (CHCO) which cleavages into CH and CO on the surface, this path being the most favorable for the C─C bond break [86]. Following to the thermal decomposition, the WGS oxidizes the CO toward CO2 and additional H2 while the CH produced can evolve towards CH4 by consecutive hydrogenations [86]. It should be highlighted here that this work demonstrated also the importance of considering the direct and the reverse reactions directions for each step and not only the direct one as it is habitually done on DFT based works [86]. As it was shown previously, catalysts based on multicomponent active phases improve substantially the activity and selectivity of reforming processes towards H2 and CO2 production. For this reason, computational methods have also been applied in the study of ethanol reforming on multicomponent catalytic surfaces. Kelly et al. [89], for example, studied the deoxygenation, reforming, and dehydrogenation of ethanol on solely molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) catalyst surfaces and on metal-modified ones by applying both experimental (temperature programmed desorption “TPD” and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy “HREELS”) and computational (DFT) methods. The addition of Ni metallic adatoms to Mo2C increases its catalytic activity for the C─C bond break leading to higher yields of CO and H2. On the other hand, the addition of Cu metallic adatoms to Mo2C increases its catalytic properties towards the C─H bond break yielding then to acetaldehyde production (see schemes in Fig. 1 or Fig. 2 for reaction paths) [89]. In this work, the DFT calculations were used to determine the binding energies of ethanol and other reaction intermediates on molybdenum and metal-modified (with Ni or Cu adatoms) molybdenum carbides. The DFT calculations showed that the adsorption energies are higher on the bare molybdenum carbide surface than on modified molybdenum carbide ones [89]. Experiments (HREELS spectroscopy) and DFT calculations have been used as well by Chen and co-workers in their study of the ethanol reforming on flat Ni(111) and Pt(111) surfaces and also on bimetallic Ni/Pt(111) surfaces [90]. Experimentally, the authors showed that the bimetallic Ni/Pt(111) surface with a Ni monolayer in top of the flat Pt(111) surface presents a higher reactivity than pure Ni(111) and Pt(111) surfaces as well as on other bimetallic surfaces since that is where the Ni atoms diffuse into the platinum subsurface [90]. The DFT results were in well agreement with these experimental observations, predicting higher adsorption energies for the species involved in the reaction on the Ni/Pt(111) surface with a Ni monolayer in top than on surfaces where platinum atoms are in the top layer [90]. The authors also found a linear correlation between the DFT adsorption energies and the d-band center of the surface, in which the binding energies increase when the d-band center shifts towards the Fermi level of the band [90]. However, the Ni/Pt(111) catalyst with a Ni monolayer in top of Pt(111) surface targeted by Chen and co-workers [90] is not stable at high temperature due to the Ni segregation towards the Pt phase and for this reason, Ren et al. [91] proposed an alternative catalyst for the ethanol reforming where the Pt is substituted by tungsten monocarbide (WC) for making it more thermally stable. The reaction pathways for the ethanol reforming are only slightly modified by the change of Pt with WC [91], suggesting that WC can be used to replace Pt in the Ni/Pt catalysts studied in the work by Chen and co-workers [90], apart from being less expensive. Importantly, Li et al. [92] studied the available reforming technologies for hydrogen production from biomass. A DFT database has been generated [93] containing energetic parameters for the reforming of ethanol, methanol and ethylene glycol on Pt, Pd, Cu and Ru surfaces, along with a compilation of WGS and oxygen decomposition steps. A multiscale method that encompasses microkinetic modeling was used to determine the activity, stability and selectivity toward H2 of different catalysts under a variety of reforming conditions, and the results were compared to experimental data [92]. Validity of linear scaling relationships (LSR) has also been validated using the database and the LSR found even allowed the extrapolation of results to large molecules like glycerol [92]. Within the LSR, Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi (BEP) relationship have been extensively used in heterogeneous catalysis for the prediction of catalysts activity from simple descriptors [94]. Within this, a considerable number of works were carried out by us and other co-workers to predict the catalytic activity of metallic surfaces for the WGS reaction [82–83, 95-97], a reaction that it is usually carried out during the reforming processes to convert CO to CO2 (se Introduction section) and, in some catalysts, is that considered to be the rate determining step [85]. The most important achievement from these works is that the adsorption energy of the water dissociation products can be used to predict the catalyst activity for the WGS reaction (or unless for its first step, the water dissociation) on metallic and bimetallic surfaces [82,83,95–97]. Finally, DFT calculations have been used as well to study the thermodynamics associated with the ethanol steam reforming under cold plasma conditions [87]. Notice however that the reaction routes followed during this process in cold plasma are different from those presented in Fig. 2. Indeed, cold plasma conditions provide electrons to the reactive medium, making thus possible reaction routes not allowed during the SR without a source of extra electrons. The results obtained from the DFT calculations showed that the dissociation of ethanol and water are the less thermodynamically favored steps but, nonetheless, the SR can be carried out at room temperature under cold plasma conditions avoiding the carbon deposition [87]. 2.1.1 Relationship between the catalyst structure and activity for the ethanol reforming catalysis The composition of the catalyst active phase or support is not the unique aspect determining the catalyst activity for the ethanol reforming. In fact, the nanoparticle size and dispersion are crucial factors determining the catalyst active phase exposed area and the availability of low coordinated atoms which are usually more reactive. These aspects of the catalyst structure are usually governed by the support used [77,78] or by other parameters, such as the catalyst preparation method or the presence of dopants during the catalyst preparation. An example for instance of the latter is the case of Ni based catalysts for H2 production from biomass, in which the Re dopant favors the Ni dispersion preventing its sintering [65]. Formation of bimetallic alloys in the nanoparticles of the catalyst active phase also enhances the catalytic activity; this is what occurs in the Co/ZnO catalyst when it is doped with Mn or Fe, leading to the formation of the alloy which modifies the Co reducibility and the catalyst reactivity [60]. Moreover, nanoparticles dispersed on a support (usually on an oxide) is not the unique scheme for the ethanol reforming catalysts, because the high performance of mixed oxides in the catalysis of this reaction has also been demonstrate. For example, in the cases of LaNiOx [70], La2Ce1·8Ru0·2O7 [72] or Y2Ce2-xRuxO7-δ (x = 0–0.4) [71] whose structure favors the synergic effects among Ru and Ce ions leading to the enhancement of the catalytic activity. Another example of the importance of the inner catalysts structure in the catalysis of ethanol reforming and its products selectivities can be seen when Rh supported on Ca–Al2O3, ZrO2 or MgO is doped with Fe2O3 oxide. Moderate Fe2O3-support interaction (Ca–Al2O3 support) favors the formation of Rh/FexOy active sites where ethanol steam reforming occurs without the formation of CO gas [75]. As referred to before, computational methods have also shown, in concordance with experimental results, the importance of the catalyst microscopic structure in the ethanol steam reforming. For instance, the bimetallic Ni/Pt(111) surface presents a higher reactivity for this reaction than that of the monometallic Ni(111) and Pt(111) surfaces [90]. Further, previous studies performed in our group [82,83,95–97] have proven the importance of the low coordinated atoms in the catalysis of WGS reaction, the latter being usually carried out during the ethanol reforming to convert CO into CO2. 2.1.2 Support effect in the ethanol reforming catalysis and DFT calculations The support not only plays a crucial role in the dispersion and size of the nanoparticles of the active phase [77,78] but, as referred to in the Introduction section, it can also influence the reactivity during the reforming process. For instance, in the ethanol reforming on catalysts based on Rh/Fe2O3 supported on Ca–Al2O3, ZrO2 or MgO, the Ca–Al2O3 support plays a crucial role facilitating the availability of Rh/FexOy active sites for CO-free reaction [75]. Moderate interaction between Fe2O3 and the support, which only occurs in the case of Ca–Al2O3 support, is related with the formation of Rh/FexOy sites [75]. The support acidity also plays an important role in the reduction of CO and coke formation during the ethanol reforming on Ni/Al2O3 catalyst and this is modified by the addition of TiO2 oxide [76]. DFT calculations have been also used to establish the support effect in the reactivity of bimetallic Ni–Pt catalysts. Concretely, DFT calculations have been used to study the relative stability of bimetallic Ni–Pt nanoparticles adsorbed on two different oxides, namely: TiO2 or γ-Al2O3 oxides. However, the obtained DFT results did not suggest a preference of the oxide TiO2 for the adsorption of any kind of bimetallic nanoparticles [98]. Here it should be remarked that the bimetallic Ni–Pt nanoparticles supported on TiO2 oxide are more reactive than on γ-Al2O3, outperforming the monometallic catalysts only when they are supported on the former oxide [98]. The different reactivity of bimetallic nanoparticles when they are supported on TiO2 or γ-Al2O3 oxides was found to be related to the variation in the binding energy of the nanoparticles on those oxides. Actually, TiO2 adsorbs weakly the bimetallic nanoparticles allowing an easier segregation of the Ni atoms towards the nanoparticle surfaces, which in turn increases the performance of the catalyst for the ethanol reforming [98]."
3,Quantum mechanics: methanol reforming studies by DFT,"2.2 Quantum mechanics: methanol reforming studies by DFT The methanol reforming on catalytic surfaces has been also extensively studied by DFT methods. Firstly, by comparing the schemes presented Figs. 2 and 3 , one should perceive that the reforming mechanism of methanol is much simpler than that of ethanol, since it is not necessary the break of a C–C bond as in the case of ethanol. Therefore, the catalysts for the methanol reforming do not need to be so active and the reaction temperature so high than in the ethanol reforming, but albeit this, compound methanol is toxic. Within the DFT works focusing in the study of the methanol reforming, Luo et al. [88] investigated the mechanism for the methanol SR on Co(0001) and Co(111) surfaces. Their DFT results clearly show that both surfaces must have a very similar reactivity following the small variation of the energetic quantities for methanol SR from one to another surface [88]. This ought to be expected since both surfaces only differ in the third layer of atoms. Moreover, the study of the full reaction mechanism (see scheme of Fig. 3 for general reaction paths for methanol steam reforming; this scheme was generated putting together all the reaction steps given in literature) shows that the methanol SR on those cobalt surfaces is more favorable following the route which includes the formaldehyde evolution towards formyl with its posteriori decomposition to CO, than the route which implies the formic acid formation by reaction of formaldehyde with a hydroxyl on the surface [88]. Among the steps comprising the faster route, the metoxide dehydrogenation to formaldehyde is that considered to be the rate determining step [88]. The CO oxidation towards CO2 can occur through the WGS reaction or directly by oxidation with O atoms, the former process being limited by the strong adsorption of the CO on these surfaces [88]. The authors also realized that cobalt surfaces are more reactive for the O─H bond break of water than surfaces of other transition metals, since the latter originate higher concentrations of O and OH on the surface, facilitating associative and dissociative steps where the O─H bond is involved [88]. It should be remembered here (see Section 2.1.1) that linear scaling relationships as BEPs were proposed as valid for the prediction of the reactivity of metallic and bimetallic surfaces as well as nanoparticles for the WGS reaction [82,83,95–97]. Note that this reaction is usually used to convert CO to CO2, increasing also the H2 amounts of the reforming process. A different picture is obtained for the methanol SR on the Cu(111) surface, the DFT calculations showed that the methanol SR starts with the O─H bond break followed by the methoxide dehydrogenation towards formaldehyde, these steps being also followed by the methanol SR on Co [88] surfaces. Formaldehyde reacts further with adsorbed OH to produce hydroxymethoxy, which decomposes to CO2 through the formic acid and formate intermediaries (this route is also exemplified in Fig. 3) [99]. The rate determining step for the methanol steam reforming on Cu(111) is the formaldehyde formation from adsorbed methoxide. Following the route just mentioned, the CO oxidation towards CO2 occurs directly without the participation of the WGS reaction or other oxidation reactions (see Fig. 3 for reaction routes). DFT calculations have also been used in the study of the methanol decomposition on the Pt(111) and Ru(0001) [100] surfaces, since this reaction route is the central part of the reforming process (see Fig. 3) [101–104]. On the platinum surface, the most favorable route is that starting with the C─H bond break (CH3OH → H2COH → HCOH → CO), which is faster than those starting with the O─H bond break (CH3OH → H2CO → HCO → CO) and with the C─H bond break followed by O─H break (CH3OH → H2COH → H2CO → HCO → CO) [101–103] whereas on the Ru(0001) surface the route starting with the O─H bond break is the most favorable. Comparing the results obtained on Pt(111) surface with those on Co surfaces, one can see that the preferential reaction route is not the same in both surfaces, because on cobalt surfaces is more favorable the reaction route starting with the O─H bond break [88]. Anyhow, the three paths are suggested as possible reaction routes for the methanol decomposition on Pt(111) surface [101–103]. Moreover, DFT calculations allowed as well to clarify the reasons for the structure sensitive of the methanol electrooxidation on Ag, Au, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ir, Rh and Ni catalysts by comparison of the onset potential and reaction mechanism on (111) and (100) terminated surfaces of those metals [105]. The DFT results presented previously for the methanol reforming (Refs. [88–105]) correspond to studies for the reaction on single monometallic surfaces but, this theoretical method has also been applied in the study of the methanol reforming on more complex catalysts models like bimetallic systems. Smith et al. [106], for example, studied through DFT calculations the methanol steam reforming on bimetallic PdZn supported on ZnO oxide. The principal conclusion of this work is that both the methanol and water dissociation are highly structure sensitive on this catalytic system. This is, the barriers on PdZn(221), PdZn(110) and PdZn(321) surfaces, which possess low coordinated atoms, are lower than on flat surfaces such as PdZn(111) or PdZn(100) [106]. Therefore, the presence of low coordinated atoms in this type of catalysts can be particularly important in the methanol SR catalysis at low temperatures. Interestingly, the methanol SR seems to follow the mechanism starting with the methoxide formation on the PdZn surfaces despite the complete routes were not investigated in thatwork [106]. An alternative route for the methanol SR is the methyl formate route in which, if water is not present, the methoxy reacts with the formaldehyde to yield methylformate that can be further hydrolyzed to formic acid, this species being then decomposed on the catalyst towards CO2. This route was investigated by Lin et al. [107] on the PdZn(111) surface but the authors conclude that it may play a minor role in the methanol SR due to the fact that the methylformate desorption is more favorable than methylformate hydrolysis towards formic acid. The methanol reforming has been as well studied by DFT methods on other bimetallic surfaces, such as those based on Co plus Pt(111) or Ni plus Pt(111). Higher binding energies for methanol and methoxy were obtained for the surfaces where the Ni or Co atoms are in the top layer and that match well with the experimental observations, which revealed higher decomposition rates for the methanol and methoxy on those surfaces [108]. These binding energies are linear correlated with the d-band center of the surfaces, which shifts towards the Fermi level when the binding energy increases [108]. The methanol reforming (OSR, SR, POX) on the ZnCu(111) bimetallic surface has been studied too by DFT calculations and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations [109]. The obtained results showed that the rate determining step of all the reforming processes is the formaldehyde formation by methoxy dehydrogenation. The presence of Zn atoms in the copper surface increases the catalyst activity toward the formaldehyde formation, which enhances the catalyst performance toward H2 production due to the fact that the turnover frequencies (TOFs) of H2 depend on the activation energy of this step [109]. Finally, DFT methods have also been applied to study the reforming of other chemicals, for example, alkanes. Here, it must be remembered that nowadays hydrogen is mainly produced by steam reforming of methane [2,3], which is the major component of natural gas. For instance, in the study of the methane steam reforming on Ni(111), DFT calculations have been used to study the methane, intermediates of methane steam reforming and steam adsorptions on Ni(111) surface, and the theoretical data obtained have allowed explaining experimental kinetic measurements [110]. The competition between steam and methane for the adsorption sites on the surface only should occur at high steam concentrations on the feed stream, and the modulation of steam/methane ratio in the feed stream can allow the minimization of CO production [110]. The steam reforming of other alkanes as propane was also studied through DFT calculations, and the obtained theoretical results permit to explain the enhanced sulfur tolerance of the Rh–Ni bimetallic catalyst in relation to monometallic ones [111]. Apparently, the improved sulfur tolerance of bimetallic Rh–Ni catalyst is linked to the lower sulfur-binding strength on the bimetallic surfaces, which reduces the impact of the sulfur in the reaction barriers [111]. 2.2.1 Relationship between the catalyst structure and activity for the methanol reforming catalysis As in the case of ethanol reforming, the catalysts structure is also a crucial aspect in the methanol reforming catalysis which conditions the catalytic activity or selectivity toward desirable products. For instance, the better performance of Au–Ru/Fe2O3, Au–Cu/TiO2, Au–Pd/ZnO catalysts [24–27] for methanol reforming, with respect to the respective monometallic ones, was related with the formation of smaller nanoparticles in the bimetallic active phase rather than in the corresponding monometallic ones which better stabilize the adsorption of reactants. Besides a smaller particle size implies a higher content of low coordinated atoms that are more reactive for reactions like the WGS [82,83,95–97]. However, in the Pd–Cu/ZnAl2O4 [28] catalyst the enhanced reactivity, with respect to the corresponding monometallic catalysts, was related with the formation of the Pd–Cu alloy. Combinations of mixed oxides as La2CuO4/CuZnAl-oxides present a higher reactivity and better H2 or CO selectivity for the methanol reforming than those of the commercial CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst, and the enhancement of their reactivity being related to the addition of La2CuO4 by the synergic effects between both oxides [32]. Further, if ZrO2 oxide is added to CuOZnOxGa2O3, a higher catalytic area and better reducibility is obtained which enhances the catalyst activity for the methanol reforming [33]. Furthermore, the activity of promising Ni–Cu catalysts for methanol reforming is also affected by the structure of the support (see next section). For example, the amorphous structure of ZrO2 support favors the water adsorption enhancing the catalyst reactivity [14]. Theoretical methods (DFT) have been successfully employed in the clarification of the structure sensitivity of methanol electrooxidation, through the comparison of the onset potential and reaction mechanism for the process on (100) and (111) surfaces of Ag, Au, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ir, Rh and Ni metals [105]. Moreover, the comparison of the barriers for the methanol and water dissociation on PdZn(221), PdZn(110) and PdZn(321) surfaces with those on flat PdZn(111) or PdZn(100) surfaces also showed the strong structure sensitive character of these reactions on PdZn based catalysts [106]. 2.2.2 Support effect in the methanol reforming catalysis and DFT calculations As stated in Section 2.1.1, the support plays a crucial role in the dispersion and size of the active phase nanoparticles that are established during the catalyst synthesis [77,78] but, on the other hand, it can influence directly the reactivity too. For instance, the good performance of Cu/CeO2 [34,35] and Ni/CeO2 [36] catalysts for the methanol reforming was related to the synergic effect between metallic phase and ceria oxide. Further, the activity and selectivity toward hydrogen of bimetallic Ni–Cu catalyst for methanol reforming can be also affected by the support composition and its crystal structure. If ZrO2 support is doped with Ce the catalyst reactivity is enhanced [41], as well as this is higher if the ZrO2 oxide has an amorphous structure in comparison with those of a higher grade of crystallinity [14]. Amorphous ZrO2 oxide presents a higher number of sites able to adsorb water [14]. DFT calculations have been employed also towards studying the support effect in the reactivity of the bimetallic PdZn/ZnO catalyst for methanol reforming, and the obtained results suggest that this can play an important role in the catalysis of that reaction [106]."
4,Thermodynamic simulation studies,"2.3 Thermodynamic simulation studies Other theoretical methods not based in quantum mechanics have also been employed for the study of light alcohols reforming or to optimize the reactor model and reaction conditions of this industrial process. For instance, Collins-Martínez et al. [112] have applied thermodynamic simulations based on the Gibbs free energy minimization technique to check the most favorable operating conditions for producing H2 with a high purity through ethanol and methanol steam reforming. Their analysis was focused in the convenience of using or not CO2 absorbents such as CaO, CaO*MgO, Na2ZrO3, Li2ZrO3 or Li4SiO4 to increase the activity and selectivity during the ethanol and methanol SR. The authors reached to the conclusion that a better performance of the steam reforming process is obtained when CO2 adsorbents are used [85]. In particular, the reactor performance was especially enhanced when promoters like CaO, CaO*MgO, Na2ZrO3 are used. Moreover, H2 free of carbon can be produced when the steam/alcohol feed molar ratios are lower than the stoichiometric ones since that increases the yield and purity of H2 effluent [85]. Thermodynamic analysis can also be used for the election of the most appropriate reforming process (steam reforming, partial oxidation or autothermal reforming) for the hydrogen production from ethanol in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) [113]. For example, the thermodynamic analysis study carried out by Tippawan et al. [113] shows that the steam reforming technique provides the highest yield of H2 but it is also the highest energy consuming, this technique offering the best performance for a steam/ethanol ratio of 1.6 and at temperature of 980 K. Other application of thermodynamic analysis has been concerned with the selection of the most appropriate reactor (fixed-bed reactor FBR1, fixed-bed reactor with H2-selective membrane (FBR2) or fixed-bed reactor with CO2 adsorption (FBR3)) for the methanol SR. Such analysis showed that FBR2 and FBR3 reactors produce H2 with a strong reduction of carbon, carbon monoxide and methane byproducts [114]."
5,Conclusions,"Hydrogen is a promising new energy source that is used as fuel in FC and does not produce exhaust gases emissions. This chemical can be produced in a renewable form through the reforming of light alcohols obtained from biomass fermentation or gasification. However, the reforming process produces considerable amounts of undesirable chemicals such as CO, CH4 or coke. Specifically, coke is deposited on the reforming catalyst poisoning it, methane formation consumes hydrogen reducing its yields, and carbon monoxide poisons the platinum catalyst used in FC even at ppm levels. Therefore, studies aiming at improving the catalysts currently used in the reforming of light alcohols are compulsory to avoid the production of those chemicals. This critical review highlights how multicomponent catalysts enhance the catalyst stability and reduce the formation of species as CO, CH4 or coke during the reforming of methanol or ethanol. Special attention was paid to the helpfulness of theoretical methods in understanding the hydrogen formation by reforming of these light alcohols − i.e. steam reforming, oxidative steam reforming or partial oxidation processes, and how the information provided by them can be successfully applied to improve the catalysts used so far in these processes. Towards such goal, it is especially noticeable how the use of DFT methods allows one to determine the reactivity of a specific catalyst site by inspecting the adsorption of the involved species and reactions on it. The data obtained from DFT calculations can then be further applied in mean-field microkinetic or kinetic Monte Carlo simulation analyses of the reforming processes on the required catalyst, making possible to infer their mechanisms and, thus allowing to really close the gap with experiments. Several examples of mechanisms for ethanol or methanol reforming were presented here, both on monocomponent and multicomponent catalysts. The mechanisms for the reforming of light alcohols can be grouped in those which produce CO2 and H2 directly or those where the alcohol is decomposed on the catalyst up the formation of CO, which is further oxidized to CO2 by the WGS reaction (SR) producing also additional H2 or by other oxidation reactions. The routes followed during the alcohol decomposition or directly CO2 formation depend on the process and catalytic surface considered, different intermediaries being involved on each process and surface. Thus, this information can be further used to the design new catalysts for alcohols reforming in a rational way. Lastly, theoretical methods have also been employed in other predictive tasks, such as the election of the best reforming process for a target catalyst, in the election of the best reactor model or to optimize the reactor conditions for hydrogen production. Indeed, theoretical results have led to the conclusion that the steam reforming produces the higher yield of hydrogen despite being the most energy demanding process, and that the reactors with CO2 absorbents are the best for the hydrogen production by steam reforming."
