0,Introduction,"Indubitably, the future use of oil reserves will most likely focus on heavy, extra-heavy crude oils, and natural bitumen [1]. In addition, the depletion of traditional (conventional) light crude oil reserves, combined with rising energy consumption, motivate the interest of companies for the production, transportation and processing of heavy oils [1,2]. However, these stages present some difficulties due to the low or zero mobility of heavy oil and bitumen at reservoir conditions and on the surface. The low fluidity of heavy crude oils is attributed to their high viscosity, low API gravity and low H/C ratio compared with light crude oils. And not only that, heavy oils are also characterized by having high content of heteroatoms (sulfur, nitrogen) and metals concentrated in high-molecular weight compounds (asphaltenes) [3,4]. All of these issues can be solved by means of heavy oil upgrading technologies either partial in-situ upgrading in reservoir to improve production and transportation, or total ex-situ upgrading in downstream facilities. The most used technologies for upgrading of heavy oil are based on hydrogen addition. In the case of in-situ heavy oil upgrading, the most representative hydrogen-addition based technology is hydrothermal upgrading (catalytic and non-catalytic) during steam stimulation, which is considered as one of the main thermal enhanced heavy oil recovery methods. Water-gas shift (WGS) reaction has been reported as the main technique to supply hydrogen in-situ, whereby the upgrading and hydrogenation of heavy oil is enhanced [5–7]. However, the amount of hydrogen supply by WGS reaction through in-situ upgrading of heavy oil during steam stimulation is not that enough to achieve the required hydrogenation degree [8–10]. One way to increase this heavy oil hydrogenation is by using hydrogen donors (HD). For instance, Liu and Fan [11] first observed that after reaction the viscosity of the upgraded oil increased fast in 5–20 days, which was attributed to the fact that active chains generated by the cleavage of C-S and C-N bonds during aquathermolysis could combine and polymerize to form heavy compounds. This problem was prevented by using 0.8% of tetralin as hydrogen donor [12]. HDs are mainly polycyclic organic compounds or polycyclic naphthenic-aromatic chemicals that can be hydrogenated and dehydrogenated reversibly in the reacting mixture. This feature makes them able to easily transfer hydrogen to the heavy oil by their dehydrogenation and release certain amount of hydrogen [1,7,13]. There are various hydrogen donors reported in the literature, each one with different capacity for donating hydrogen, cost, and hydrogenation and dehydrogenation conditions, especially temperature [14–16]. In general, almost any organic compound with a low oxidation potential can be used as hydrogen donor. This low oxidation potential enables the transfer of hydrogen(s) from the donor to the substrate under mild reaction conditions [1]. It should be mentioned that HDs have been used for long time in different areas such as hydrogen carries, i.e., liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) [17–21], or as additives for improving the biomass liquefaction process, where solvents such as sub- and supercritical water, alcohol, decalin, glycerol and tetralin were employed as potential HD to improve the liquid oil yield with low oxygen content [22–27]. A series of H-donors has been reported to be used during in-situ or ex-situ upgrading as well as in hydrotreating of heavy oils and bitumen as summarized in many works [1,6,28–32]. Tetralin is the most-tested HD in presence or absence of catalyst [12,30,31,33–35]. Different experimental results have demonstrated that using a catalyst together with a HD can accelerate the transfer of hydrogen atoms to the heavy oil compounds, thus improving the quality of the upgraded oil and minimizing the polymerization of the heavier molecules [32]. On the other hand, various studies have been focused on the development of stable and active dehydrogenation catalysts based on Pt or other noble metals, as well as their modifications [36–40]. However, due to their high cost (especially Pt), researchers are seeking for other substitutes. As a result, repeated attempts have been undertaken to replace noble metals. Nickel-based catalysts, which are cheaper and readily available, have shown to be particularly promising in this scenario [41,42]. In addition, different hydrogenation/dehydrogenation catalysts have been tested for heavy oil upgrading [43]. Hart et al. [44] investigated the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of tetralin and naphthalene to explore heavy oil upgrading using NiMo/Al2O3 and CoMo/Al2O3 catalysts heated with steel balls via induction. It was found that Ni metal showed higher hydrogenation/dehydrogenation functionality than Co. Eblagon et al. [45] studied the hydrogenation reaction of N-ethylcarbazole using different Ru-based catalysts. Simultaneously, the catalytic performances of various supported catalysts using noble metals, such as Ru, Rh, and Pd, on the hydrogenation of N-ethylcarbazole as a LOHC, were compared [46]. More studies about the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation catalysts were summarized recently in a review article [47]. Going back to HDs, decalin is also an appropriate hydrogen source because of its high theoretical hydrogen capacity of 7.3 wt% (64.8 kg H2/m3), and physical–chemical properties [48,49]. The dehydrogenation of decalin is widely recognized to be an endothermic reaction. In this regard, extremely active catalysts capable of carrying out multiple hydrogenation/dehydrogenation cycles without losing activity are required for a successful dehydrogenation reaction [50]. Nickel-based catalysts have recently shown to be more suited for this reaction due to their low cost, availability, and efficiency [50]. The performance of Ni-based catalysts with decalin depends on the nature of the heavy oil to be upgraded. Asphaltenes content and their properties, heteroatom content, among others play an important role to determine the extent of hydrogen donation. Therefore, more research with different heavy oils is needed to properly establish the best conditions for appropriate heavy oil upgrading. To contribute with the study of this reaction, decalin is used in this work as HD under the catalytic and non-catalytic hydrothermal upgrading of a heavy oil from Tatarstan (Russia) oilfield. The upgrading and donating (dehydrogenation) capacity and conversion of decalin in the presence of Ni-based catalyst (nickel (II) stearate) were evaluated. All of the experiments were carried out at 300 °C, 72 bar (1044.27 psi) and 24 h of reaction time. Conversion of decalin, release and consumption of hydrogen during decalin dehydrogenation in the presence of nickel (II) stearate and composition of the dehydrogenated products were studied."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The properties of the heavy crude oil used in all experiments are presented in Table 1 . It is characterized by high content of sulfur, low API gravity, and high viscosity. Decalin (decahydronaphthalene, mixture of cis + trans) used as HD was purchased from Sigma Aldrich with a purity of 99%. Solvents used for SARA (Saturates, Aromatics, Resins, and Asphaltenes) analysis, n-heptane (99 %), toluene (98.5 %), and isopropyl alcohol (98 %), were supplied by Eco. 1 Company (Russia). Dichloromethane, also provided by Eco. 1, was used as solvent to collect dehydrogenated (converted) products after reaction. Commercial nickel (II) stearate with purity ≥ 98% was used without further treatment as catalyst."
3,Experimental setup and procedure,"2.2 Experimental setup and procedure All experiments of hydrothermal upgrading of heavy oil in the presence and absence of decalin and nickel (II) stearate were carried out in a 300 mL volume high pressure/high temperature reactor (Parr Instruments 4560, USA). Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of the experimental device. In a typical experiment, the reactor was loaded with the heavy crude oil and water in a ratio of 70:30 g/g, respectively. The catalytic and non-catalytic reactions were conducted in the presence and absence of heavy crude oil for ease evaluation of hydrogen releasing and consumption, as well as conversion degree of decalin. For hydrothermal experiments in the presence of decalin and nickel (II) stearate, 1.4 g (2 wt% based on the total amount of heavy oil loaded to the reactor) of each of them was loaded to the reactor. Regarding the catalytic and non-catalytic dehydrogenation experiments with decalin (without heavy oil) the same amounts of decalin and Ni-stearate than those used with heavy crude oil (1.4 g) were used. All the experiments for upgrading of heavy oil and dehydrogenation of decalin were carried out at 300 °C, 72 bar (1044.27 psi) and 24 h of reaction time under N2 atmosphere. The initial nitrogen pressure for the experiments in the presence of heavy oil and water with and without decalin and catalyst was 2 bar (29.01 psi) and it reached 72 bar (1044.27 psi) during experiments. To maintain the same pressure for all tests, experiments of decalin dehydrogenation were carried out at 52 bar of initial nitrogen pressure, which reached 72 bar at 300 °C. For the dehydrogenation of decalin in the absence of heavy crude oil under catalytic and non-catalytic conditions, the same amounts of decalin and Ni-stearate than those utilized with heavy crude oil (1.4 g) were used. More details of the experimental procedure can be found in our previous works [2,51]. At the end of the experiments (after 24 h reaction time), the heating system was stopped, and the reactor was cooled down to room temperature. Later, the evolved gases obtained were analyzed by a Chromatek-Crystal 5000 GC model, which directly connected to the outlet of the reactor. Fig. 2 illustrates the experimental procedure for evaluation of the upgrading of heavy crude oil and dehydrogenation of decalin during catalytic and non-catalytic conditions. Five experiments (3 in presence of heavy crude oil, and 2 without heavy oil) were conducted as follows: I – decalin, II – decalin with Ni-stearate, III – heavy oil with decalin and water, IV – heavy oil with decalin, Ni-stearate and water, and V – heavy oil with water as a control (reference) experiment for comparison."
4,Analysis of upgraded oil,"2.3 Analysis of upgraded oil Hydrogenated (upgraded) oils were separated from water using an Eppendorf 5804R centrifuge set to 40 °C and 5000 rpm for 2 h. A Perkin Elmer 2400 Series II analyzer was used to determine the elemental composition of both the initial and hydrogenated oil samples. In addition, oil samples were separated into SARA fractions (after excluding decalin and its dehydrogenated products such as tetralin and naphthalene using GC) using the ASTM D 4124 standard [52]. In this method, asphaltenes are separated from other hydrocarbon components by the addition of n-heptane. The remaining components, called maltenes were separated into saturates, aromatics, and resins using a chromatographic column with different adsorbents (according to ASTM D 4124 method) as described in detail in our previous work [2]. Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph was used to analyze the carbon number distribution in saturates of initial and upgraded oils. Gas chromatography was used to determine the composition of evolved gases including methane (CH4), sum of C1–C4 hydrocarbons, hydrogen, H2S, CO2, and N2. More details about the materials and procedures regarding gas chromatography, elemental and SARA analysis can be found in previous works [2,10,53]. Furthermore, a Clever C31 655 energy dispersive XRF spectrometer equipped with a high 656 resolution detector (135 eV) with electric cooling on a Peltier 657 element was used to determine the microelements including V, Ni, Fe and Cu [54]. Moreover, the viscosity of initial and upgraded oil samples was measured using a rotational viscometer (Viscolead One L, Fungilab) at 25 °C and 1 bar (14.50 psi)."
5,Analysis of dehydrogenated products,"2.4 Analysis of dehydrogenated products The composition of the dehydrogenated products were determined using a chromatograph-spectrometric study (Agilent 6890 N/5973 “Agilent” quadrupole gas spectrometer, USA) with the ionization method (electron ionization). The energy of ionizing electrons was 70 eV and the temperature of the ion source was 230 °C. An HP-5MS capillary column (30 m length, 0.25 mm diameter). The thickness of the phase layer is 0.25 µm. The carrier gas is helium. The conditions for obtaining a chromatogram were: injector temperature of 320 °C, flow division (split) of 1:5, and column heating was carried out in the program mode in sections: initial temperature of 100 °C (5 min), heating rate of 20 °C/min up to 300 °C, and final temperature of 300 °C (30 min). Furthermore, the carrier gas flow through the column was 1 mL/min. The temperature of the device for communication with the mass spectrometer is 300 °C. Additionally, the sample volume was 1 μL with the analysis time for one sample of 45 min and mass range of 50–800 amu. It should be mentioned that, the dehydrogenated products (for the experiments without heavy crude oil) were collected by washing the reactor with dichloromethane followed by their filtration (2.5 μm filter). Later, the remained dehydrogenated products on the filtration paper were washed using the same solvent by extraction. After that, dichloromethane was removed with a rotary evaporator. To calculate the dehydrogenation conversion of decalin (total content of cis- and trans-isomers), the following equation was used: (1) Conversion = C 0 ∑ D - - C ∑ D C 0 ∑ D × 100 where, C0∑D and C∑D are the initial and final content of transformed decalin, respectively."
6,Analysis of initial and spent oil-soluble catalyst,"2.5 Analysis of initial and spent oil-soluble catalyst The transformation of nickel (II) stearate to nanoparticles was carried out at the same condition of the best performance of hydrothermal upgrading (nickel (II) stearate, heavy oil and decalin under N2 atmosphere). The condition of the experiment were as follows: 300 °C, 72 bar (1044.27 psi) and 24 h of the reaction time. At the end of the experiment, the formed nanoparticles were obtained by washing the reactor with dichloromethane followed by their filtration, extraction and removal of the used solvent using a rotary evaporator. Then, the formed nanoparticles together with the initial Ni-stearate were collected, dried and analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. D2 Phaser (Bruker Axs GmbH) was used to record the diffraction patterns of initial and spent Ni-stearate after catalytic hydrothermal upgrading of heavy oil [10]."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Evaluation of the upgrading performance,"3.1 Evaluation of the upgrading performance 3.1.1 GC analysis of gases The composition of produced gases is one of the main factors for evaluating the heavy crude oil upgrading performance by using different HDs or catalysts [5,55]. According to Hyne et al. [56], during hydrothermal upgrading of heavy oil various non-condensable gases can be produced such as light hydrocarbons (C1-C4, isoalkanes and alkenes, etc.), H2S, CO2, and hydrogen. The composition of the non-condensable gases produced in the five experiments including the thermal and thermal catalytic conversion of decalin without out heavy oil is reported in Table 2 . For the experiments in presence of heavy oil, the total amount of methane and sum of C2–C4 including alkanes, isoalkanes, and alkenes increased by adding decalin and Ni-stearate to the upgrading system. Cleavages of alkyl side chains linked to resins and asphaltenes are the reasons of this increase. In addition, the presence of H2S, H2 and CO2 indicates the occurrence of hydrodesulfurization and thermal decomposition reactions. Regarding the experiments without heavy crude oil, the content of H2 for decalin (1.0641 wt%) increased by adding Ni-stearate (2.9318 wt%), which confirms the degree of dehydrogenation of decalin under such conditions [50]. The presence of CO2 for the experiments with decalin + Ni-stearate without heavy crude oil may indicate the thermal decomposition of carboxylic functional group of Ni-stearate. Furthermore, thermal decomposition of side chains of stearate to small fragments can be the main reasons of the presence of propanes and butanes in the produced gases. 3.1.2 Viscosity and SARA analysis of oil samples before and after upgrading Table 3 shows the values of viscosity and SARA analysis for heavy crude oil and upgraded oils with and without decalin and Ni-stearate at 300 °C, 72 bar (1044.27 psi) and 24 h. The results with only water showed that the viscosity at 25 °C was slightly reduced (11%). When decalin and decalin + catalyst were added, additional viscosity reductions were obtained, 50 % and 69 %, respectively. This clearly indicates the positive effect of both decalin and catalyst. In terms of changes in SARA fractions, the results show that upgrading of heavy crude oil in presence of water only results in a minor decrease in the content of resins and asphaltenes, and consequently a small increase in the amount of saturates and aromatics. Furthermore, during hydrogenation (both catalytic and non-catalytic), more noticeable decreases in the content of resins and asphaltenes and increases in the content of saturates and aromatics were observed. Cleavages of heteroatom bonds (such as C-S), that split resins and asphaltenes molecules into smaller fragments, can explain the improved quality of upgraded oil [57–59]. Such changes in the resins and asphaltenes structures during hydrothermal upgrading have been studied in various works [60–62]. Yi et al. [59] investigated the change of asphaltene and resin properties after catalytic aquathermolysis in the presence of various oil- and water-soluble catalysts at 280 °C and 48 hrs. The conversion of resins and asphaltenes was evaluated by different techniques including ultimate analysis, 13C and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), average molecular weight, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and vapor pressure osmometer (VPO). The results indicate that aromatization and dealkylation of asphaltene could produce asphaltene products with higher polarity. In addition, the average structural parameters and molecular weight of asphaltenes and resins showed that these heavy compounds partly aggregated after aquathermolysis thus increasing their molecular weight as compared with the heavy oil asphaltenes and resins [59], which has contrary behavior than hydroprocessing of heavy oil [63]. This highlights the importance of detailed characterization of asphaltenes and resins before and after hydrothermal upgrading of heavy crude oil to explain the performance of different catalysts and hydrogen donors, which is planned for future studies in our laboratory. Viscosity reduction can be masked by the dilution effect of decalin addition. To be clear about this, the heavy crude oil was diluted with 2 wt% of decalin. The resulting dynamic viscosity of the blend was 1794.3 mPa.s, corresponding to 13.5 % reduction compared with the heavy crude oil. By comparing this viscosity value with those obtained with the use of decalin and catalyst, it is clearly confirmed that the influence of both is beyond the dilution effect. 3.1.3 Elemental analysis H/C ratio and the content of heteroatoms are other properties that can help evaluate the hydrogenation and thermal conversion of heavy crude oil and their components [63]. It is well-known that heteroatoms are mostly concentrated in resins and asphaltene molecules as C-O, C-N, and C-S bonds [64]. The weakest bonds are always cleaved first during hydrothermal upgrading. In turn, from the dissociation energies of the C–H, C–C, C-N, and C-S main bonds (96–99, 83–85, 69–75, and 66 Kcal/mol, respectively), the C-S bond is the easiest to be cleaved [2]. Table 4 shows the results of elemental analysis and sulfur removal before and after hydrothermal upgrading. It is observed that both nitrogen and sulfur contents were reduced, particularly sulfur reached a maximum removal of 15.84% by introducing decalin and nickel (II) stearate. In addition, the H/C molar ratio increased after upgrading, especially when using decalin and catalyst, which reveals that a higher degree of hydrogenation was achieved. The reduction of heteroatoms contents indicates that resins and asphaltenes are experiencing changes in their molecular structure, which can be due to both thermal effect and catalytic effect, which are the causes of viscosity decrease [64]. 3.1.4 Carbon number distributions in saturates Table 5 illustrates the results of carbon number distribution in saturates fraction for initial and upgraded oil samples. To ease the comparison, the carbon numbers were grouped into two parts, C10 − C20 corresponding to light distillates (216–342 °C), and C21 − C31, heavy fractions (356–458 °C). An increase in the content of the light fractions (C10 − C20) at expenses of the heavy fractions (C21 − C31) was observed for all upgrading experiments. The cleavage of those long-alkyl side chains present in resins, asphaltenes and probably in aromatic hydrocarbons, may be responsible for the increasing of C10-C20 content [3]."
9,Evaluation of donating (dehydrogenation) degree of decalin,"3.2 Evaluation of donating (dehydrogenation) degree of decalin The chemical composition of the dehydrogenated products obtained at 300 °C, 72 bar (1044.27 psi) and 24 h in presence and absence of heavy crude oil is presented in Fig. 3 . These compositions were used together with Eq. (1) to calculate the conversions of decalin for the different cases, which are depicted in Fig. 4 . The results show that the dehydrogenation degree of decalin under non-catalytic conditions without and with heavy crude oil was relatively low, 3.95 and 4.62%, respectively. However, when introducing Ni-stearate catalyst, decalin conversions increased to be 21.95% and 17.98% in the presence and absence of heavy crude oil, respectively. In all cases, the main dehydrogenation product is tetralin. Naphthalene was produced in small amount. Additionally, as shown in Fig. 3, such a decalin dehydrogenation occurs via cis-decalin conversion rather than trans-decalin conversion, which confirms previous studies in this area [65,66]. It was also found that conversion of decalin under non-catalytic conditions favors the isomerization of cis-decalin towards trans-decalin as mentioned by Kalenchuk et al. [65]. Even in the absence of Ni-stearate, there are substantial interconversions between decalin, tetralin and naphthalene. This behavior would explain the similar effectiveness of these compounds as hydrogen donors. It should be noted that the performance of decalin conversion with and without catalyst in presence of heavy crude oil was slightly higher (almost 4%) than that in absence of heavy crude oil. This may be due to the presence of various metals in the initial heavy crude oil, such as Ni, Fe, and Cu, which can act as promoters of decalin conversion. Estimation of the amount of hydrogen released during catalytic and non-catalytic conversion of decalin is important for appropriate evaluation of the dehydrogenation reaction performance. Fig. 5 shows the release (dehydrogenation) and consumption (hydrogenation) of hydrogen (wt %) during decalin conversion in presence and absence of nickel (II) stearate. As mentioned in the literature, the total potential of the hydrogen capacity of decalin system is 7.3 wt% [48,49]. In this work, Chromatek-Crystal 5000 Gas chromatograph (see part 2.2) was used to evaluate the releasing and consumption degree of hydrogen during catalytic and non-catalytic conversion of decalin in the presence and absence of heavy crude oil. The results show that, the maximum release of hydrogen was 2.93 wt% in presence of decalin and Ni-stearate without heavy crude oil. The decrease of hydrogen content observed during catalytic and non-catalytic dehydrogenation of decalin confirms the hydrogen addition (in-situ upgrading) to the heavy crude oil, which is also supported by the increases of H/C ratio and API gravity, and changes in SARA composition discussed above."
10,Changes of oil-soluble catalyst before and after hydrothermal upgrading,"3.3 Changes of oil-soluble catalyst before and after hydrothermal upgrading X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) technique was used to evaluate the changes of oil-soluble catalyst before and after hydrothermal upgrading of heavy crude oil. XRD patterns of obtained spent Ni-stearate are shown in Fig. 6 . Nickel oxide (NiO) and nickel sulfide (Ni3S2) are the main observed phases. This means that nickel in these two phases can play a role as active form and accelerate the extent of dehydrogenation of decalin, hydrogenation of the heavy crude oil and enhancing the hydrodesulfurization, leading to an additional sulfur removal [67,68]. Based on the obtained results for heavy crude oil upgrading with and without catalyst and on the decalin dehydrogenation, as well as on previous theoretical and experimental basis in this area, the possible reaction mechanism of decalin dehydrogenation is shown in Fig. 7 [1,7,50,66]. First, the active sites of catalyst (nickel oxide and sulfide) attack mainly the C-S bonds of the side chains of aliphatic and aromatics parts of resins and asphaltenes) [2,6,59,69] Later, the obtained free radicals after thermal decomposition of side chains will be linked with hydrogen produced during dehydrogenation of decalin as named by hydrogenation route. Generally, the dehydrogenation of decalin includes four simultaneous, reversible reaction pathways: (a) tetralin formation from trans- and (b) cis-decalin, (c) the conversion of tetralin to naphthalene, and (d) isomerization of cis- and trans-decalins."
11,Conclusions,"The effect of decalin as a hydrogen-donor solvent under the catalytic and non-catalytic hydrothermal upgrading of heavy oil from Tatarstan oilfield (Russia) was studied. The upgrading, donating (dehydrogenation) capacity and conversion of decalin in presence of nickel-based catalyst (nickel (II) stearate) were also evaluated. All the experiments were carried out at 300 °C, 72 bar (1044.27 psi) and 24 h of reaction time. From the obtained results, the following major conclusion can be drawn: • Regarding the catalytic and non-catalytic dehydrogenation of decalin: • The maximum conversions of decalin with Ni-stearate are 21.95% and 17.98% in presence and absence of heavy crude oil, with selectivity mostly towards tetralin formation; • Even in the absence of Ni-stearate, substantial interconversions between decalin, tetralin and naphthalene are observed, indicating that all of these compounds are effective as hydrogen donors; • Efficient releasing of hydrogen is achieved by dehydrogenation of decalin with and without catalyst; • The decrease of the content of hydrogen released during catalytic and non-catalytic dehydrogenation of decalin in presence of heavy crude oil confirms the in-situ upgrading heavy crude oil; • Ni-stearate was mainly in-situ transformed into particles of NiO and Ni3S2, which act as active phases for catalyzing the dehydrogenation of decalin and promoting heavy oil upgrading. • The addition of decalin as hydrogen-donor under catalytic (using Ni-stearate) and non-catalytic hydrothermal conditions promotes the in-situ upgrading of heavy crude oil; • Introducing Ni-stearate as an oil-soluble catalyst together with decalin enhances the donating capacity of decalin, thus improving the upgrading performance; • In the presence of decalin and catalyst a noticeable improvement of the physical properties and chemical composition of upgraded oils are obtained, such as viscosity reduction (from 2073.7 to 637.8 mPa·s), increase of H/C ratio, reduction of sulfur content, increase of saturates and aromatics, and decrease of the content of resins and asphaltenes; • An increase of the light fractions (C10 − C20) and decrease in the content of C21 − C31 in saturates is observed for all upgrading experiments, with a significant improvement in the presence of decalin and Ni-stearate."
