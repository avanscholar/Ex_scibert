0,Introduction,"There is an increasing interest in renewable fuels for combustion application, both in the transport sector and in power generation. Although electric vehicles for personal transportation is gaining popularity, the need for liquid fuel will remain for the foreseeable future for air, land and sea transportation [1,2], and also for power production using gas turbines [3]. Furthermore, there is existing infrastructure for liquid fuel, which makes the transition to liquid biofuel attractive for practical and economic reasons. Another advantage is that liquid biofuels have similar properties to traditional fossil fuels [4], and the industry is working on increasing the efficiency of transforming biomass into biofuel [5]. Small alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, and propanol, show promise as substitute fuels and have been studied in detail the latest decade. Combustion experiments of small alcohol fuels using shock-tubes [6–9], spherically expanding flame [10,11], meso-scale diverging channel [12], heat flux- [13,14], and counter-flow burners [15,16] have been used to study combustion characteristics, including chemical kinetics. Several complex kinetic mechanisms have been developed and validated against these data sets, as outlined below. These models contain up to thousands of reactions and hundreds of species, allowing for simulations of zero- and one-dimensional experimental setups for a large range of conditions. One of the first methanol mechanisms was made by Westbrook et al. [17] and then further updated by Held et al. [18]. Li et al.[19] developed a methanol mechanism that has been widely used and which was then further improved by Skodje et al. [20]. For ethanol combustion, there exist many complex mechanisms. The well-known mechanism by Marinov is widely used for high temperature ethanol combustion [21]. Konnov et al. [22] made a mechanism to accurately predict the temperature dependence of laminar burning velocity. Olm et al. [23] developed a mechanism for ignition, flame propagation and species profiles. Similarly, Dagaut et al. [24] developed a mechanism for 1–10 bars, for ignition, flame propagation and species profiles in flow reactors. Recently, Li et al. [25] created the AramcoMech 2.0 mechanism, with updated ethanol chemistry, based on the previous AramcoMech 1.3 [26], which was focused on the C1-C3 chemistry, with limited validation for biofuels. AramcoMech 2.0 is validated against experimental data for a wide range of C1-C4 hydrocarbons fuels, including several oxygenated molecules. Although there are several publications of AramcoMech 2.0 being used for methanol and ethanol modelling, there is limited validation included for propanol. Gong et al. used AramcoMech 1.3 as a starting point when developing their propanol mechanism [27] (referred to as Gong in the following). These are the most detailed and widely validated representations of real alcohol combustion chemistry that is currently available. To assist in development of engines and fuels in the transition from fossil fuels to liquid biofuels, the engine- and gas-turbine industries uses Computation Fluid Dynamic simulations (CFD). These simulations enable predictions and optimisations of engine performance, to a lower development cost compared to corresponding experimental studies. A common CFD approach for simulating turbulent reactive flows is the Large Eddy Simulation (LES). Using LES, both turbulence and kinetic models can be combined to accurately simulate the physics involved in highly turbulent combustion applications [28]. This process is computationally expensive and requires a small and highly accurate kinetic mechanism of the size 20–30 species and 60–80 reactions [29]. These mechanisms should still be able to reproduce the results of the complex mechanism in a given range of conditions. The detail of the chemistry model should be on the same level as the transport model, according to Hilbert et al. [30], which means that a simple one or two step mechanism cannot be used. Small kinetic schemes of less than 20 species and around 40 reactions are available for the simplest hydrocarbon fuel, methane [31,32]. As the complexity of the fuel molecule increase the chemistry rapidly becomes more complex and thus a larger number of species and reactions need to be included to accurately represent the chemistry. For longer chain alkane fuels, small mechanisms can be constructed by simplification of the intermediate chemistry, as described by Zettervall et al. [28]. Oxygenated fuels like the alcohols have a structure with many potential isomeric fuel radicals for a given carbon chain length, which increase the number of reaction paths. The simplest example is that the simplest alcohol, methanol, has two different unique hydrogens that can be abstracted while the corresponding alkane methane only has one. The authors of the present work have recently developed a method for reduction of complex kinetic mechanisms and with success applied it to the case of methanol to produce a kinetic mechanism with 18 species and 55 reactions, for SI-engine conditions [33]. There exist many reduced kinetic schemes for the smallest alcohol fuels, with various degree of validation. Extensive study has been carried out for methanol, with small mechanisms for ignition being developed by Seiser et al. [34] and Aranda et al. [35]. Liao et al. [36] made a mechanism that reproduced laminar burning velocities as well as some species profiles. For ethanol, Minuzzi et al. [37], developed a 24 species and 26 reaction skeletal mechanism for jet diffusion flames using Directed Relation Graph (DRG), which was further reduced by steady state approximations to a ten step scheme [37]. Millán-Merino et al. [38] used a similar approach to develop a skeletal mechanism of 85 reactions and 19 species, but for a wider range of conditions, spanning autoignition, laminar burning velocity, counter-flow flame structure and extinction [38]. Liu et al. [39] made a mechanism for fuel blends of alcohols, from methanol to n-pentanol, which is one of few skeletal mechanisms for n-propanol. The main issue with developing small kinetic mechanisms is that the important chemistry of flame propagation is not the same as for extinction phenomenon, which in turn is different from high- or low temperature ignition. The complexity increases further when the carbon chain length of the alcohol increases, as fuel isomers have different reaction paths, leading to more reactions that have to be part of the mechanism. As outlined in our work on n-heptane [40] the different combustion characteristics rely on different subsets of the chemistry and creation of a reduced kinetic mechanisms can be made in an efficient way by knowledge of which reaction subsets are needed for a mechanisms tailored for a particular application. In the present work, kinetic mechanisms for combustion of small alcohols are investigated with the aim of comparing the chemistry required in a small kinetic mechanism of methanol, ethanol and n-propanol. Seven reduced skeletal mechanisms are presented, one for methanol, one for ethanol and five for n-propanol, which highlights the important chemistry for reduction of small alcohols. The methanol and ethanol mechanism have been developed and validated against ignition, flame propagation, and extinction, while the n-propanol mechanisms are developed for one phenomenon each (and one for the combined set). Following validation plots, the included chemistry of the mechanisms is discussed, and comparisons of the pathways for the different alcohols are made."
1,Mechanism development,"The seven skeletal models presented in this article have been derived from either AramcoMech 2.0, for methanol and ethanol, or Gong for n-propanol. Initially, all reactions containing species with four or more carbon atoms were removed from AramcoMech 2.0, reducing the size of the mechanism to 171 species and 1929 reactions (counting each reversible reaction twice), from 493 species and 5131 reactions. The same procedure was carried out for Gong, but the limit was five instead of four, reducing the size from 257 species and 3118 reactions, to 137 species and 1695 reactions. This initial reduction was made after some preliminary reduction tests showed that no species with more carbon atoms than the fuel was ever selected. This initial reduction brought down the computational times, and enabled more computational resources to be spent on optimising the relevant chemistry selection, while still retaining some possibility of larger species being formed. In the list of reactions for each mechanism, found in Supplementary material, it can be seen that even though this was a possibility, no species with more carbon atoms than the fuel was selected, which makes the preliminary assumption valid. Table 1 presents a list of development conditions, chosen to be similar to internal combustion engine conditions, that was used for the reduction and optimisation. The Ant-Colony Reduction (ACR) methodology, previously applied to create a small skeletal mechanism for methanol combustion at SI-engine conditions [33] and several skeletal mechanisms for atmospheric chemistry simulations [41], was used in this study. The semi-stochastic algorithm selects a number of reactions and species from a base mechanism to form a skeletal mechanism. This mechanism is then tested and optimised to fit the result of the base mechanism. To compensate for missing chemistry, the A-factors of the Arrhenius parameters for each reaction were optimised within a specified range. If the original rate is x, then the new rate y is in the range x λ , λ x , where λ was chosen as 1.2 for reactions only containing C0-species and 3.0 for the rest. The choice of λ is was made using a crude estimate of uncertainty for each reaction rate based on reaction class in order to keep the legitimacy of the chemistry intact. Each simulation type from Table 1 was used individually to create mechanisms. These mechanisms were then combined into one mechanism for each fuel named “Full”. A mechanism for n-propanol ignition at high temperature (>1100 K) was also created, using the IDT conditions. The naming convention for the mechanisms is C1 for methanol, C2 for ethanol, and C3 for n-propanol, combined with the condition type, e.g. C3-IDT for ignition delay time for n-propanol. Each subset for methanol and ethanol is not presented in this article, as the main discussion will be focused around the n-propanol chemistry, but instead the combined mechanism spanning all of the conditions in Table 1 are presented. The size of each skeletal mechanism is found in Table 2 , and was chosen as the smallest possible mechanism with less than 5% average deviation from the corresponding complex mechanism. Interesting to note is that the C3-NPE mechanism is the smallest mechanism of the C3-mechanisms, indicating that extinction chemistry is represented by a small number of reactions. This finding is in contrast to the work by Esposito and Cheliah where it was concluded that for the fuel ethylene non-premixed extinction required more complex chemistry than ignition and flame propagation [42]."
2,Validation,"Both AramcoMech 2.0 and Gong have been thoroughly validated against experiments for their respective fuels, methanol and ethanol for Aramco, and n-propanol for Gong. This means that it is enough to find agreement between the skeletal mechanisms and the corresponding complex mechanism to validate the chemistry selection of the reduction. The chemistry solver used in this article was CANTERA 2.4 [43]. For extinction strain rate, the strain increase was set to 10% per iteration and the nozzles were 5 mm apart, with pure fuel in one and air in the other of equal mass flow. The flame was considered extinct if the maximum temperature of a stable solution was below 1700 K. The grad and curve parameters for both the extinction and freely propagating flame simulation were set to 0.1 and 0.2, respectively, and mixture average diffusion was used. Ignition delay time was defined as the global maximum gradient of OH radicals of the whole simulation range, and the simulation continued until at least 0.05 s and equilibrium of OH had been found. The result of these simulations are visualised in Figs. 1–7 . Figs. 1–3 show extinction strain rate from the reduced mechanisms compared to their corresponding complex mechanism. Fig. 1 shows the methanol case with AramcoMech 2.0 and C1-Full; Fig. 2 shows the ethanol case with AramcoMech 2.0 and C2-Full; and Fig. 3 shows the n-propanol case with Gong and C3-Full and C3-NPE. For methanol and ethanol, Figs. 1 and 2, the skeletal mechanisms accurately reproduce the simulation results of AramcoMech 2.0, with a small deviation for the 40 atm case of ethanol. In Fig. 3, a similar discrepancy at the high pressure case can be observed for C3-Full, but in general there is good agreement. C3-NPE, on the other hand, underperforms for the 40 atm case, but agrees fairly well with the remaining conditions. Fig. 4 shows laminar burning velocities for the reduced mechanisms and their corresponding complex mechanism. Except for a small deviation in the case of low pressure and high equivalence ratio for ethanol, all the skeletal mechanisms have excellent agreement with their complex counterparts. The deviation between skeletal and complex mechanisms are in all cases within common uncertainties and scatter in experimental data. Figs. 5–7 show ignition delay times for the stoichiometric case for each of the skeletal mechanisms. Although the log-scale of the y-axis makes it difficult to exactly determine the deviation, it can be seen that the skeletal mechanisms follows the complex mechanisms very well, and each trend is perfectly replicated. For the small alcohols, there is no Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC)-region, as for long chained fuels like, for example, n-heptane, but the low temperature ignition still requires many species and reactions, and the IDT mechanisms were among the largest ones for all fuels. Figures, corresponding to Figs. 5–7, for the lean and rich case of IDT demonstrate similar agreement, shown in Supplementary material."
3,Reaction path analysis,"The chemical pathways found in the skeletal mechanisms for each of the alcohol fuels are very different. All species and reactions that contain carbon in each of the skeletal mechanisms are visualised in Figs. 8–12 . The reaction diagram of the mechanism C3-IDT-HT and C3-Full, as well as a comparison of C3-IDT-HT and C3-IDT, can be found in Supplementary material. Fig. 8 shows the reaction paths of C1-Full, the skeletal mechanism for methanol. From the figure, it is clear that three possible fuel breakdown reactions are present. Yet, the paths converge through formaldehyde before completing the oxidation route to CO2, indicating that it is only the fuel breakdown stage for methanol that is sensitive to the initial combustion conditions. This mechanism is dominated by oxygenated species, and it is only at high temperatures that the C–O bond is broken, but is quickly formed again as CH3 reacts and becomes CH2OH. Moving up in complexity, ethanol has five possible fuel breakdown paths compared to the three of methanol. Fig. 9 shows the reaction paths of C2-Full, the skeletal mechanism for ethanol. Interesting to note is that out of the five possible fuel breakdown reactions only three are retained in the reduced mechanism C2-Full. This reduction from five to three fuel breakdown paths indicate that at the target conditions the chemistry can be sufficiently described by the two reactions, which enable significant reduction of mechanism size compared to the complex reaction mechanism used as a starting point. The three retained breakdown reactions of ethanol are the high temperature fuel decomposition that breaks the C–C bond, forming CH3 and CH2OH, and the H-abstraction from either of the carbon atoms resulting in PC2H4OH and SC2H4OH depending on which carbon atom that lost a hydrogen atom. The CH4 seen in Fig. 9, is a by-product of CH3 radicals reacting with the fuel. In the fuel decomposition case, both of the carbon species follow a similar reaction path as can be seen for methanol in Fig. 8, even including the possibility to form methanol temporarily. In the H-abstraction case, the chemistry is more complex, but can be broken down into three separate paths. The first path is that the C–O bond is broken, and the remainder of the combustion path is similar to alkane chemistry. The second path keeps the C–O bond, but after a couple H-abstractions, the C–C bond is broken and the rest of the chemistry is similar to the methanol case. The last path binds O2 to the fuel radical, forming O2C2H4OH, similar to the start of the reaction chain of low temperature ignition chemistry of NTC regions of alkanes. The molecule is then decomposing, in an irreversible reaction, into two formaldehyde molecules. This reaction ends the OO chemistry early, and is caused by the lack of an extended C-chain to react with in order to form QOOH, which implies that this is the only possible reaction path. Similar can be found in the case of the complex mechanism, thus confirming that the skeletal mechanism kept that entire low temperature chemistry path. As is shown in Fig. 6, the logarithm of the ignition delay times has a linear relation with the inverse temperature, even at low temperatures, which means that there are no competing reactions causing a similar behaviour as the NTC region of alkanes. For n-propanol, the chemistry is getting even more complex, with seven possible fuel breakdown reaction paths. Given the high complexity, the following pathway analysis has been split into sub-mechanisms for each of the simulation cases found in Table 1. Fig. 10 shows the simplest system, the C3-NPE skeletal mechanism developed for extinction strain rate of n-propanol. Out of the seven possible fuel breakdown paths, only one has been selected. The fuel radical in turn, only has one decomposition reaction into C2H3OH and CH3. C2H3OH follows a similar H-abstraction path as the second path discussed for C2-Full in Fig. 9, while CH3 connects to a methanol like reaction branch. The extinction process is mostly governed by high temperature chemistry, but in order to get the point of extinction correct, the low temperature kinetics matters as well. Similar to the discussion for C2-Full, n-propanol does not contain enough carbon atoms in the chain in order to form the whole OOQOOH chemistry for low temperature cases, which means that there are fewer competing reactions in the intermediate temperatures. This explains why only the high temperature reactions are needed to describe the extinction process in the skeletal mechanism. In Fig. 3, it is shown that for the high pressure case, C3-NPE predicts extinction at a lower strain rate than the complex mechanism, which is likely due to the lack of large species in the mechanism, changing the diffusive properties a little. A closely related mechanism, the C3-FP skeletal mechanism developed for laminar burning velocity of n-propanol, is visualised in Fig. 11. This mechanism contains many more reactions than the mechanism for extinction, and starts with three fuel breakdown reactions instead of one. The H-abstraction of the hydroxyl group leads into the breaking of C–C bond and formation of C2H5 eventually, with the oxygenated carbon atom either becoming CO or CH2O, both of which follow the C1-chemistry seen in C1-Full. The C2H5 chemistry is similar to the C2-Full mechanism, making this path similar to the smaller fuels. The two remaining paths, H-abstraction from the first or the third carbon atom, decomposes in the next step into one alkane part and one oxygenated C1 or C2 species, followed by the corresponding reaction path found in C1-Full or C2-Full. The C3-FP mechanism is thus just a few fuel breakdown reactions away from closely resemble the mechanisms of the smaller alcohol fuels. The final mechanism, C3-IDT, that was created for ignition delay times of n-propanol, is around twice the size of the C3-FP mechanism and is visualised in Fig. 12. It contains five of the seven fuel breakdown reactions, skipping the breaking of the C–O bond and the C–C bond between the two non-oxygenated carbon atoms. Since the ignition delay time is strongly dependent on the fuel chemistry, it makes sense that more emphasis on details of this part is found in the C3-IDT mechanism compared to the C3-FP or C3-NPE. Furthermore, the detail of the C3 and C2 chemistry is much higher than the other skeletal mechanisms. Instead of breaking up the C3 species into fragments in two steps, there are several channels available that are interconnected. A similar interconnectivity is found for the C2 species, especially the non-oxygenated ones, revealing a high empathsis on the C3-C2 chemistry. The C1-subset is similar to the other skeletal mechanisms, with many reactions leading to formaldehyde, with only a few more species not found in previously presented mechanisms."
4,Conclusion,"One skeletal mechanism for combustion at engine conditions of methanol, one for ethanol, and four for n-propanol were presented. The selection criterion was the smallest mechanism with less than 5% deviation in simulation results between the mechanism and the corresponding complex mechanism. The species and reactions selected in the mechanism reduction process are the most prominent reactions for each case, and this identification of subsets of reactions of high relevance can serve as a starting point for small alcohol mechanism. For example, there is a common base set of C1-chemistry, presented in Supplementary materials, found in all the applications, suggesting that all those reactions are always required to accurately predict ignition delay times, laminar burning velocity, or extinction strain rate. This is very prominent in the C3-NPE mechanism, which only contains a few fuel breakdown reactions on top of the C1-set. A similar approach most likely would work for all small oxygenated fuels with carbon chains shorter than four. The C3-IDT mechanism requires many species and reactions to accurately reproduce ignition delay times of the complex mechanism, since there are many competing reactions that become relevant when reaching the lower temperatures. When only the high temperature (>1100 K) region was used, the mechanism could become 16 species and 59 reactions smaller, indicating that the low temperature region requires significantly more detail in the chemistry. This shows the importance of tailoring the selection of conditions to the target application, in order to keep the size of the skeletal mechanism to a minimum. The skeletal mechanisms presented in this article are suitable, or just above the upper limit in size, for LES applications. The exception is the C3-IDT, which is too large, and further studies are needed to fully understand how to reduce the low temperature subset enough while still retaining the accuracy of the result. We consider the mechanisms developed in the present work as the minimum size of skeletal mechanism retaining an intact hydrocarbon chain, to accurately reproduce the results of the complex mechanisms for the present conditions. Further reduction in size likely require additional simplifications, like lumping of reactions or species."
