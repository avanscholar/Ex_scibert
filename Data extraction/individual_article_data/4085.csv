0,Introduction,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a collective term of very small reactive molecules that include a variety of free oxygen radicals (superoxide anion, nitrite and hydroxy radical) but also oxygen derivatives such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), peroxynitrite and ozone [1,2]. ROS are an essential physiological regulator and serve as an important biological messenger in cell signal transduction cascades [3]. Therefore, balanced production of ROS is critical for normal aerobic metabolism and functioning of several signaling in the body. However, the overproduction of ROS leads to oxidative stress, resulting in significant damages to cell structures such as lipid, DNA and proteins [4]. Accumulation of oxidative stress damages over time is associated with many life-threatening diseases including asthma, cystic fibrosis, Alzheimer’s and related neurodegenerative diseases, arthrosclerosis, and cancer [5]. In particular, H2O2 is a major ROS in living organism and plays a key role as a second messenger in normal cellular signaling. Its homeostasis can have diverse physiological and pathological consequences [1]. Recently, numerous publications have suggested that controlled burst of hydrogen peroxide can serve beneficial roles for cell survival, growth, differentiation and maintenance. However, the overexpression of H2O2 causes oxidative damages to tissues and organs and has been implicated in inflammatory responses and afore-mentioned life-threatening diseases [6]. It is well known that asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and lung cancer are induced by the enhanced generation of ROS such as H2O2 [7]. Nitric oxide (NO) is a highly reactive free radical synthesized from the amino acid l-arginine by the reaction of nitric oxide synthases (NOS) [8]. Despite its essential physiological role in the regulation of vascular tone, response to vascular injury and hemostasis under physiological states, NO is also recognized as an important immunomodulatory and cytotoxic mediator of inflammatory responses in the lung [9]. The excessive NO production causes tissue damages in which NO reacts with oxygen free radicals to form peroxynitrite which is a strong and important oxidant in various diseases [10]. It was also reported that human asthmatics have the higher level of NO and increased expression of iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthases) in the airway of epithelium than non-asthmatic humans [11]. Therefore, ROS have great potential as a diagnostic and therapeutic biomarker of various inflammatory responses and there is increasing interest for the development of strategies to reduce oxidative stress by ROS [12,13]. p-Hydroxybenzyl alcohol (HBA) is the major active ingredient of Gastrodia elata which has been a widely used herbal agent for the treatment of headache, tetanus and inflammatory diseases in oriental countries. HBA is one of phenolic compounds and plays a protective role against oxidative damage-related diseases such as ischemic brain injury and coronary heart diseases [5,12,13]. It is also a powerful scavenger of free radicals such as superoxide and hydroxyl radical and exerts antioxidant activities [14]. Recently, it was reported that HBA isolated from the ethylacetate fraction of G. elata exhibited anti-asthmatic activities by inhibiting the intraluminal accumulation of inflammatory cells particularly eosinophils and neutrophils [15]. Thus, there is increasing interest in the use of HBA as a potent antioxidant and pharmaceutical agent. We have developed polyoxalate (POX) as a biodegradable drug carrier through the simple reaction of oxalyl chloride and aliphatic diol. By taking the advantages of the ease synthesis of polyoxalate and potent antioxidant activity of HBA, we developed HBA-incorporated copolyoxalate (HPOX) and reported its physico-biological properties and potential as a drug delivery system [16]. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the activity of HPOX nanoparticles as a polymeric antioxidant to reduce the oxidative stress and to treat the inflammatory diseases in vivo and in vitro. The H2O2 scavenging activity of HPOX nanoparticles was evaluated using the Amplex Red assay. We measured the level of ROS such as NO and H2O2 during the stimulus-induced inflammatory response of RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. The potential of HPOX nanoparticles to reduce the oxidative stress in vivo was studied using a murine model of asthma."
1,Experimental,
2,HPOX synthesis,"2.1 HPOX synthesis HPOX was synthesized as previously reported [16]. In brief, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol (21.96 mmol) and 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (5.49 mmol) were dissolved in 20 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF), under nitrogen, to which triethylamine (60 mmol) was added dropwise at 4 °C. Oxalyl chloride (27.45 mmol) in 25 mL of dry THF was added to the mixture dropwise at 4 °C. The reaction was kept under nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature for 6 h and polymers were obtained through the extraction using dichloromethane and isolation by precipitating in cold hexane. The chemical structure of polymers was identified with a 400 MHz 1H NMR spectrometer (JNM-EX400 JEOL). 1H NMR in deuterated chloroform on a 400 MHz spectrometer: 7.2–7.3 (m, 2H, Ar), 7.5–7.6 (m, 2H, Ar), 5.3 (m, 2H OCH2-PhO), 4.1–4.3 (m, 4H, COOCH2CH), 1.8–2.0 (m, 2H, C(CH2) 3HO), 1.0–1.8 (m, 8H, Cyclic CH2)."
3,Particle preparation and characterization,"2.2 Particle preparation and characterization Fifty milligrams of polymers dissolved in 500 μL of DCM was added to 5 mL of 10 (w/v)% PVA, poly(vinyl alcohol) solution. The mixture was sonicated using a sonicator (Fisher Scientific, Sonic Dismembrator 500) for 30 s and homogenized (PRO Scientific, PRO 200) for 2 min to form a fine oil/water emulsion. The emulsion was added into 20 mL PVA (1w/w%) solution and homogenized for 1 min. The remaining solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator. Nanoparticles were obtained by centrifuging at 11,000g for 5 min at 4 °C, washing with deionized water twice and lyophilizing the recovered pellet. The morphology and size of polyoxalate nanoparticles were observed by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi) with accelerating voltage of 10 kV."
4,Cytotoxicity assay of HPOX nanoparticles,"2.3 Cytotoxicity assay of HPOX nanoparticles MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was performed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of HPOX nanoparticles. RAW 264.7 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well in a 24 well plate containing 1 mL of culture medium and incubated for 24 h to reach ∼90% confluency. Cells were given various amounts of nanoparticles (10 μg/mL to 100 μg/mL) and incubated for 48 day. Each well was given 20 μL of MTT solution and was incubated for 4 h. Two hundred microlitters of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to cells to dissolve the resulting formazan crystals. After 30 min of incubation, the absorbance at 570 nm was measured using a microplate reader (E-Max, Molecular Device Co.). The cell viability was obtained by comparing the absorbance of nanoparticles-treated cells to that of control cells."
5,Scavenging of hydrogen peroxide,"2.4 Scavenging of hydrogen peroxide Various amounts of HBA, HPOX or POX nanoparticles were added into 1 mL of hydrogen peroxide solution (10 μM). The hydrogen peroxide solutions were incubated at 37 °C with mechanical stirring for 24 h. After short centrifugation, the hydrogen peroxide concentration of the supernatant was determined using the Amplex Red assay (Invitrogen, US) according to the manufacturer’s protocol."
6,Measurement of intracellular ROS,"2.5 Measurement of intracellular ROS RAW 264.7 cells (1 × 106 cells) were seeded in a glass bottom dish (MatTek Corp.) and incubated for 24 h. Cells were treated with HBA, HPOX nanoparticles and POX nanoparticles for 4 h and incubated with H2O2 (200 μM) or PMA (0.5 mg) for 4 h. DCFH–DA (dichlorofluorescin–diacetate) was added to each dish and 0.5 h later the fluorescence images were made with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss). To quantify the fluorescent cells, flow cytometry was also performed with a Flow Cytometry Caliber (Becton Dickinson, US). The percentage of cells in positive events was calculated as the events within the gate divided by total number of events then subtracting percentage of the control sample."
7,Detection of NO and iNOS,"2.6 Detection of NO and iNOS RAW 264.7 cells (1 × 106 cells/well in a 24 well plate) were pretreated with a various amount of HPOX nanoparticles for 4 h and then treated with 1 μL of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 mg/mL) for 2 days. The concentration of NO was determined using a colorimetric assay based on the Griess reaction. Fifty microlitters of cell culture medium was collected and given 100 μL of Griess reagent (6 mg/mL) at room temperature for 10 min, and then the NO concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm using a microplate reader (E-Max, Molecular Device Co, US). The NO standard curve was constructed using known concentrations of sodium nitrite. For the detection of iNOS, cells were also subjected to immunofluorescence staining using a monoclonal antibody for iNOS (Santa Cruz, US). Cells were blocked with protein block, serum-free (Dakocytomation. Inc, US) for 1 h, and treated with a primary antibody iNOS (Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Inc, USA) for 18 h and a secondary antibody, mouse IgG labeled with Alexa Fluoro 555 (Invitrogen, US) for 3 h. Cells were also stained with DAPI for nuclear counterstain."
8,Animal model and histological analysis,"2.7 Animal model and histological analysis Animal studies were performed according to the protocol (CBU 2010-020) approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee Review Board and ChonbukNational University Laboratory Animal Center. BALB/c mice (n = 4) were sensitized by i.p. injection of 50 μg ovalbumin (OVA, Sigma–Aldrich) on day 1. On day 8 and 15 mice were challenged intranasally with 50 μg of OVA. Mice were given 50 μL of POX or HPOC nanoparticles intranasally on days 16 and 17. Control mice were given PBS only. On day 18, mice were euthanized and their lungs were perfused with PBS, removed and fixed in 4% buffered formalin. Lungs were embedded in paraffin, sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Unstained lung tissue sections were also stained with a monoclonal antibody for iNOS (Santa Cruz, US)."
9,Results,
10,Development of HPOX nanoparticles,"3.1 Development of HPOX nanoparticles As shown in Scheme 1 , HPOX was synthesized from a simple one-step reaction of oxalyl chloride with diols, 0.8 equivalent of cyclohexanedimethanol and 0.2 equivalent of HBA. HPOX prepared in this study possesses both aromatic and aliphatic peroxalate esters and has hydrophobicity sufficient for nanoparticle formulation by a single emulsion method. As shown in Fig. 1a, HPOX nanoparticles were round spheres with a smooth surface and a mean diameter of ∼450 nm. MTT assay was performed to test the cytotoxicity of HPOX nanoparticles using RAW 264.7 cells. Cells were treated with various amounts of HPOX nanoparticles for 1 and 2 days and the cell viability was determined. No change in the cell viability was observed with cells after 1 day of incubation with HPOX nanoparticles (Fig. 1b). After 2 days of incubation, cells incubated with 100 μg of HPOX particles showed the slightly reduced cell viability. However, no cytotoxicity was observed with cells treated with HPOX nanoparticles less than 100 μg, demonstrating that HPOX nanoparticles have excellent cytotoxicity profiles."
11,H2O2 scavenging of HPOX nanoparticles,"3.2 H2O2 scavenging of HPOX nanoparticles Either HPOX nanoparticles, POX nanoparticles or HBA was added into 1 mL of H2O2 solution (10.0 μM) and the H2O2 concentration was measured after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C using the Amplex Red assay. Fig. 2 illustrates the reduction of H2O2 concentration by HBA, POX nanoparticles or HPOX nanoparticles. POX nanoparticles exhibited a slight reduction of H2O2 concentration in a dose-dependant manner. HBA showed minimal reduction of H2O2 concentration. However, HPOX nanoparticles showed a significantly lower H2O2 concentration than POX nanoparticles and HBA. More than 50% of reduction of H2O2 concentration was observed with 1 mg of HPOX nanoparticles, demonstrating that HPOX nanoparticles quench H2O2 in a dose-dependent manner. HPOX nanoparticles showed a more dose-dependant H2O2 scavenging activity than POX nanoparticles and HBA."
12,Reduction of oxidative stress by HPOX nanoparticles in H2O2–stimulated cells,"3.3 Reduction of oxidative stress by HPOX nanoparticles in H2O2–stimulated cells The inhibitory effects of HPOX nanoparticles on the production of intracellular ROS were investigated using an intracellular fluorochrome, dichlorofluorescin-diacetate (DCFH–DA). RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with either HBA, POX nanoparticles or HPOX nanoparticles for 4 h and incubated with exogenous H2O2 (200 μM) as an oxidant as well as a stimulant for the generation of oxidative stress. DCFH–DA was then added to each well and the H2O2-induced fluorescence was observed with a confocal fluorescence microscope. The level of intracellular fluorescence was quantified by flow cytometry. Fig. 3 reveals the effects of HPOX nanoparticles on the generation of H2O2-mediated ROS. Cells given DCFH–DA only showed very weak fluorescence. A strong fluorescence was observed with cells treated with exogenous H2O2 because DCFH–DA was oxidized to fluorescent DCF by the exogenous H2O2 and H2O2-mediated oxidants. Pretreatment of free HBA reduced the H2O2-induced fluorescence in a dose-dependent fashion. POX nanoparticles also showed reduction of H2O2-induced fluorescence almost the same extent as 0.5 mM of HBA. HPOX nanoparticles exhibited a significantly reduction in H2O2-induced fluorescence in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment with 50 μg of HPOX nanoparticles resulted in more than 80% reduction in H2O2-induced fluorescence."
13,Reduction of oxidative stress by HPOX nanoparticles in PMA-stimulated cells,"3.4 Reduction of oxidative stress by HPOX nanoparticles in PMA-stimulated cells Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) was also used to stimulate cells for ROS generation and the PMA-induced intracellular oxidants were observed with a confocal fluorescence microscope and flow cytometry (Fig. 4 ). PMA-stimulated cells showed a strong fluorescence because DCFH–DA was oxidized by intracellular ROS including H2O2, hydroxyl radical and peroxynitrite, which were generated during PMA-stimulation. Pretreatment with 0.5 mM of HBA resulted in the reduction of PMA-induced fluorescence due to its antioxidant activity. POX nanoparticles also exhibited the inhibitory effects on PMA-induced fluorescence to some extent. Pretreatment with HPOX nanoparticles significantly reduced PMA-induced fluorescence in a dose-dependent manner. More than 90% reduction of PMA-induced fluorescence was observed by 50 μg of HPOX nanoparticles."
14,Reduced generation of nitric oxide by HPOX nanoparticles in LPS-stimulated cells,"3.5 Reduced generation of nitric oxide by HPOX nanoparticles in LPS-stimulated cells RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with either HBA, POX nanoparticles or HPOX nanoparticles for 12 h and then treated with 1 μg of LPS for 48 h to generate NO. The inhibitory effects of HPOX nanoparticles on NO production were examined based on the Griess reaction. Fig. 5 shows the inhibitory effect of HPOX nanoparticles on the NO production in activated cells. LPS-stimulation resulted in a large production of NO and the NO concentration increased up to 18 μM at 48 h post-stimulation. Pretreatment with 62 μg of HBA completely inhibited the LPS-induced NO production. HPOX nanoparticles also inhibited the NO production, in a dose-dependent manner. Complete inhibition of LPS-induced NO production was achieved with 50 μg of HPOX nanoparticles. NO production was not detected even 48 h after the treatment of HPOX nanoparticles. However, POX nanoparticles exhibited no inhibitory effects on NO production. In order to confirm if inhibitory effects of NO generation result from the suppression of iNOS production, LPS-stimulated cells were subjected to immunofluorescence staining with a monoclonal antibody to iNOS. Fig. 6 shows the representative micrographs of immunofluorescence staining. Bright immunofluorescence was demonstrated with an LPS-treated group. iNOS immunofluorescence staining was markedly attenuated with cells treated with 0.5 mM HBA. Weak immunofluorescence was observed with cells treated with 25 μg HPOX nanoparticles and no immunofluorescence was observed after the treatment of 50 μg HPOX nanoparticles. However, POX nanoparticles showed no effects on iNOS expression. The results clearly demonstrate that HPOX nanoparticles inhibit NO production by suppressing iNOS expression."
15,Reduction of oxidative stress by HPOX nanoparticles in the pulmonary inflammation,"3.6 Reduction of oxidative stress by HPOX nanoparticles in the pulmonary inflammation Pulmonary inflammation was induced in mice by the ovalbumin (OVA) sensitization and challenge. Either HPOX nanoparticles or POX nanoparticles were intranasally delivered to the mice and the antioxidant activity of HPOX nanoparticles on pulmonary inflammation was studied. The histological examination of the lung sections is shown in the top panel of Fig. 7 . Few inflammatory cells were observed in the lung of PBS-sensitized and challenged control mice. Lungs from OVA-sensitized and challenged mice showed severe inflammation, evidenced by epithelial damage and a large number of inflammatory cells infiltrated around the terminal bronchioles, alveolar sac and peripheral vasculature [17,18]. Luminal narrowing due to the airway wall oedema and luminal obstruction with excess mucus were also observed, which are typical hallmarks of bronchial inflammation. HPOX nanoparticles intranasally delivered resulted in the reduction of inflammatory cell infiltration in a dose-dependent manner. Mice treated with 100 μg of HPOX nanoparticles showed considerable inhibition of inflammatory cell infiltration around the respiratory track. However, POX nanoparticles did not attenuate airway inflammation, though they exhibited H2O2 scavenging activity to some extent in vitro. Unstained lung sections were examined for expression of iNOS by staining with antibody against iNOS. The bottom panel of Fig. 7 shows the immunohistochemistry of iNOS expression patterns. Control mice showed no expression of iNOS. In contrast, OVA-sensitized and challenged mice showed a significantly high expression of iNOS in bronchial epithelia and inflammatory cells such as macrophages and eosinophils [19]. POX nanoparticles showed minimal or no reduction of iNOS-stained cells. However, HPOX nanoparticles significantly inhibited the iNOS expression."
16,Discussion,"Polyoxalate was chosen as a scaffold of the polymeric HBA prodrug because of its easy synthesis, biocompatibility and excellent biodegradation profiles [20,21]. HBA has diols on the aromatic ring and is therefore suitable in the synthesis of polyoxalates which have been prepared from a simple reaction of oxalyl chloride and diol [20,22]. We thus pursued fully biodegradable HBA-incorporated polyoxalate (HPOX), which contains potent antioxidant HBA covalently in its backbone and is able to serve as a polymeric prodrug of HBA. In this study, the molar ratio of cyclohexanedimethanol to HBA was decided after the careful consideration of stability in aqueous environments and reactivity to H2O2 [6,16]. It has been reported that the aromatic peroxalate compounds instantaneously react with H2O2 specifically to decompose into carbon dioxide, and rapidly degrade under aqueous conditions via hydrolysis [6,23,24]. In contrast, polyoxalate with aliphatic peroxalate ester has low reactivity to H2O2 and undergo slow hydrolytic degradation under aqueous conditions. Therefore, we reasoned that HPOX containing both aliphatic and aromatic peroxalate ester linkages is able to scavenge H2O2 and completely degrades because aromatic peroxalate ester linkages in the polymer backbone react with H2O2, leading to the cleavage of the polymer backbone and the release of HBA. As demonstrated in the SEM image, HPOX we developed with 0.8 equivalent of cyclohexanedimethanol and 0.2 equivalent of HBA was hydrophobic enough to formulate into nanoparticles under aqueous conditions. We first investigated the ability of HPOX nanoparticles to scavenge H2O2 in vitro. As shown in Fig. 2, HPOX nanoparticles remarkably reduced the H2O2 concentration after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C. Unexpectedly, POX nanoparticles showed reduction of H2O2 concentration to some extent, suggesting that aliphatic peroxalate ester linkages are also capable of reacting with H2O2. However, H2O2 scavenging activity of POX nanoparticles is moderate in comparison with HPOX nanoparticles. The higher H2O2 scavenging activity of HPOX nanoparticles can be explained by the presence of aromatic peroxalate ester linkages in the backbone, which have high reactivity to H2O2 [6,24]. We next investigated the inhibitory effects of HPOX nanoparticles on intracellular ROS in stimulus-activated RAW 264.7 cells using DCFH–DA. DCFH–DA has been widely used to measure various oxidative stress in cells because of its unique features [13,25–27]. It can diffuse passively into cells and is non-fluorescent until it can be oxidized by the action of various intracellular oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical and peroxynitrite [28,29]. The exogenous H2O2 (200 μM) was used as an oxidant and a stimulant for the generation of other ROS [30] in cells. H2O2-treated cells exhibited a bright fluorescence because DCFH–DA was oxidized by the added excess H2O2 and H2O2-mediated ROS including hydroxyl radical and peroxynitrite to form dichlorofluorescein that can emit a strong fluorescence. A remarkable inhibition (∼60%) of H2O2-induced intracellular fluorescence was observed with cells pretreated with 62 μg of HBA (0.5 mM). Since HBA has no or minimal H2O2 scavenging activity as shown in Fig. 2, the significant reduction of H2O2-induced fluorescence by HBA is attributed to its ability to suppress H2O2-mediated ROS such as superoxide, hydroxyl radicals and peroxinitrite, demonstrating that HBA is an excellent antioxidant [5,14]. As expected from the H2O2 scavenging experiment (Fig. 2), POX nanoparticles also reduced H2O2-induced intracellular fluorescence. The reduction of H2O2-mediated ROS by POX nanoparticles is due only to H2O2 scavenging activity of aliphatic peroxalate esters because POX does not release HBA. It turns out that aliphatic peroxalate esters in POX readily react with H2O2 in cells and therefore are capable of scavenging H2O2. In comparison with POX nanoparticles, HPOX nanoparticles showed a significantly lower intensity of H2O2-inducedfluorescence. The suppression of H2O2-induced fluorescence by 50 μg of HPOX nanoparticles is even more potent than that of 0.5 mM HBA. We also observed that cyclohexanedimethanol which is one of degradation products showed no scavenging activity of H2O2-mediated ROS (data not shown). Therefore, the remarkable reduction of H2O2-induced fluorescence by HPOX nanoparticles can be explained by the combined effects of aromatic peroxalate ester linkages and HBA released. Aromatic peroxalate ester linkages rapidly reacted with and therefore scavenged H2O2, leading to the degradation of HPOX nanoparticles. Potent antioxidant HBA was subsequently released during the degradation and inhibited the production of H2O2-mediated ROS. We also used PMA as a stimulant to generate intracellular ROS. Pretreatment with POX nanoparticles resulted in ∼30% reduction in PMA-induced intracellular ROS. However, HPOX reduced more than 90% generation of PMA-induced intracellular ROS. These results suggest that aromatic peroxalate ester linkages in the HPOX backbone effectively scavenge PMA-induced H2O2 and HBA released from the HPOX nanoparticles inhibits the generation of various intracellular oxidants. Nitric oxide (NO) is a highly reactive radical and may serve a protective function to scavenge superoxide under physiological conditions [7,19,31]. Despite its protective functions, the excessive production of NO contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammation, cellular injury and tissue damages in a lung [3,12,17,32]. We investigated the inhibitory effects of HPOX nanoparticles on NO production during the inflammatory response of LPS-stimulated cells. Inhibition of NO production by 62 μg of HBA (0.5 mM) is in agreement of previous reports [13]. In comparison with POX, HPOX nanoparticles exhibited highly potent antioxidant activity to inhibit completely the generation of NO. The results demonstrate that the strong inhibitory effects of HPOX nanoparticles on NO production are due mainly to the HBA which is released from HPOX during its degradation. NO production is known to be catalyzed by inducible nitric oxide synthases (iNOS) [33]. It has been well known that the suppression of iNOS-derived NO is a closely linked anti-inflammatory action [32]. To ascertain the hypothesis that the reduction of NO generation results from the suppression of iNOS expression, the cells were stained with antibody against iNOS. As shown in Fig. 6, pretreatment with HPOX nanoparticles reduced the level of iNOS expression, demonstrating the HPOX nanoparticles release HBA which inhibits the NO production by suppressing the iNOS expression. Another oxygen-mediated mechanism of damage is inflammation, during which inflammatory cells release mediators that may cause broncoconstriction and edema as observed during an asthmatic reaction [19]. The potent antioxidant activity of HPOX nanoparticles prompted us to further investigate whether HPOX nanoparticles could exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities in asthmatic lungs. We used a murine model of asthma to test whether HPOX nanoparticles attenuate the allergen-induced pulmonary inflammation by scavenging ROS and/or inhibiting the ROS generation. HPOX showed a considerable reduction in the established pulmonary inflammation, evidenced by the less epithelial damage and decreased number of infiltrating inflammatory cells in the interstitial and peribronchovascular regions, in comparison with control and POX nanoparticles. The anti-inflammatory effects of HPOX nanoparticles may result from the strong antioxidant activities such as scavenging H2O2 and inhibiting the generation of various oxidants such as NO. Immunohistochemistry of iNOS expression revealed that HPOX nanoparticles reduced the generation of iNOS in pulmonary inflammation, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory activity of HPOX nanoparticles is attributed to HBA which is released during their degradation and suppresses the expression of iNOS [18,34]."
17,Conclusions,"We developed fully biodegradable polyoxalate (HPOX) nanoparticles, which can release HBA during the hydrolytic degradation and exert antioxidant activities. HPOX nanoparticles significantly reduced the level of intracellular oxidative stress during the stimulus-induced inflammatory response in RAW 264.7 cells. HPOX nanoparticles intranasally delivered significantly reduced the expression of iNOS and attenuated allergic inflammation in a murine model of asthma. The potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of HPOX nanoparticles result from the combined effects of aromatic peroxalate esters in the HPOX backbone and HBA released. Aromatic peroxalate ester linkages in the backbone of HPOX readily reacted with and scavenged H2O2, leading to the degradation and subsequent HBA release. HBA released from HPOX significantly inhibited the generation of NO by suppressing the expression iNOS. We believe that fully biodegradable HPOX is a potent polymeric antioxidant and is very useful for the treatment of oxidative stress-related diseases."
