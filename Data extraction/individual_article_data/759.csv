0,Introduction,"Cephalexin (CEP) is a beta-lactam cephalosporin antibiotic (He et al., 2019). It is one of the prescribed and excellent antibiotics due to the wide range of antibacterial activity and high solubility in water (Aram et al., 2020). More than 90% of this antibiotic enters the environment through urine and feces because it has a low bioavailability rate which raises environmental concerns (Tavasol et al., 2020). Cephalexin is a widely prescribed drug to treat infectious diseases worldwide (2670 tons of CEP in 2013 in China, 163 tons of CEP in 2005 in Brazil) (Davari et al., 2017; Aram et al., 2020). Cephalexin concentrations were reported 5 μg/L in their effluent the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) (Minh et al., 2009). The elimination efficiency of CEP in conventional WWTP treatment was documented to be 9–96% (Watkinson et al., 2009; He et al., 2019). However, this antibiotic has been found in 81% of seawater samples and 50% of coastal sediment samples, which confirms the need to upgrade conventional WWTPs systems to further remove it (Kafaei et al., 2018). As a result, antibiotic-contaminated wastewater treatment is a fundamental issue, and highly efficient options should be considered to destroy drug compounds from wastewater. Recent methods used to remove cephalexin from aqueous solution are including NiO-clinoptalitaneno photo-catalyst (Ajoudanian and Nezamzadeh-Ejhieh, 2015), physicochemical methods (Calvete et al., 2019), chlorine gas for removal/decomposition (Acero et al., 2010), nanoparticles ZnO nanocatalyst under the new sun (He et al., 2019), adsorption, ozonation, membrane filtration (He et al., 2019), sono-degradation (Magdziarz et al., 2016), and Fenton oxidation (Soltani and Lee, 2016). Among these technologies, photo-catalysts based on semiconductor metal oxide are more advanced in protecting the environment (Yang et al., 2020a, 2020b, 2020c). Therefore, compared to other methods, photocatalysts have recently attracted tremendous research in the field of research to eliminate antibiotic pollutants from water due to their cheapness and high efficiency (He et al., 2019). Recently, ultraviolet (UV) has also been used to treat emerging contaminants (Wang and Wang, 2016). A combination of UV and hydrogen peroxide has been examined to increase the ability of UV in destroying contaminants (Michael et al., 2013). The oxidizing potential of H2O2 can be reasonably promoted by synthesizing OH• by splitting O–O and energy of the quantum photon (above 213 kJ/mol, energy band, corresponding to a λ < 280 nm) (Michael et al., 2013). Therefore, with the UV process, a lower concentration of oxidant is used, which leads to a reduction in treatment costs (Michael et al., 2013). Therefore, a great effort has been put into TiO2-based photocatalysts, mainly by combining them with organic and/or mineral materials for absorbing more UV wavelengths and preventing the recombination of carriers (Calvete et al., 2019). Another mechanism in advanced processes is based on ultrasound (US), which produced hydroxyl radical by the pyrolysis of water molecules. Ultrasonic waves also accelerate the reaction by increasing the mass transfer. The synergistic influence of ultrasonic with other advanced oxidation systems (AOSs) overlaps many problems of ultrasonic alone in terms of economic (energy consumption) and time (Rayaroth et al., 2016). Also, the effectiveness of H2O2 for increasing the rate of sono-degradation of pharmaceuticals has been proven to produce more radicals (Michael et al., 2013). Recently, to improve the efficiency of the AOSs, catalysts such as C–N–S–TiO2 (Wang et al., 2011a), C–N–TiO2 (Wang et al., 2011b), N–TiO2 (Vaiano et al., 2015), Biochar–TiO2 (Kim and Kan, 2016), FeO-GO-TiO2 (Wang et al., 2018), AlG-TiO2 (Sarkar et al., 2015), Sn doped Co3O4 (Keerthana et al., 2021b), Sm doped zinc ferrite (Keerthana et al., 2021a), Co and Ni-Ox-ACs (Murugesan et al., 2021), and sistal fiber-TiO2 (Orbeci et al., 2016) compounds have been effectively tested to remove contaminants. The mentioned catalysts face challenges like costs despite their suitable efficiency. Therefore, researchers will use waste to provide catalysts with lower costs. One of the wastes that researchers have so far overlooked is seabed sediments. The sea sediments are usually cleaned in the piers every few years. This sediment (or sludge) contains a variety of organic and mineral compounds. Therefore, if it is properly processed, it can probably be used as a photocatalyst. Therefore, in this work, the photocatalytic properties of sea sediments were intensified with titanium dioxide to activate hydrogen peroxide. The sea sediment-titanium photocatalyst beside UV and ultrasonic waves were applied to remove CEP removal from aqueous environments. The influence of contact time, photocatalyst (sea sediment-titanate) mass, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) quantity, cephalexin concentration, aqueous environment pH on the cephalexin decomposition has been investigated. The best kinetic model for acquired data was also explored. Besides, the mechanism of pollutant decomposition and synergistic effects of the components of the system (sea sediments-titanate/H2O2/US/UV), as well as the interfering effects of cations and anions and energy consumption, were tested."
1,Material and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Titanium isopropoxide (Ti{OCH(CH₃)₂}₄) and H2O2 (35%) were provided from Merck Company and Kimia Exir, respectively. Ethanol (C2H5OH, 96%) was supplied from Khorasan Distribution Company. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) were manufactured by Kimia Materials. The cephalexin powder (formula: C16H17N3O4S·H2O and molecular weight: 347.390 g/mol, and purity: 99.89%) was purchased from Dana Pharmaceutical Company. The exact amount of 0.2 g CEP powder was delivered to 20 mL distilled water to provide a 1000 mg/L CEP. This solution was prepared daily due to instability. The COD value of 100 mg/L CEP was analyzed to be 208 mg/L."
3,Reactor specifications and tests conditions,"2.2 Reactor specifications and tests conditions The batch tests were implemented in a 3-Liter ultrasonic instrument (Sonica, 2200 EP, frequency: 40 kHz). A steel reactor equipped with a UV lamp (Charge Jiang model, intensity: 15 W/m2) was put inside the ultrasonic bath. The antibiotic solution with a desired content was poured into the reactor to be exposed to UV light and ultrasonic waves. Details of the reactor are given in Fig. S1 in the supplementary section. The tests were performed in batch mode and each test was repeated three times and their average and standard deviation were provided in the results. The details of test conditions are listed in Table S1."
4,Preparation of sea sediment-titanate photocatalyst,"2.3 Preparation of sea sediment-titanate photocatalyst The wasted sediments were prepared from active docks in Bushehr province, Iran. The precursor of catalyst (wasted sediments) first dried completely at 105 °C during a day. Then, the dried-sediments were becoming mill and screened (mesh number 40). The metal content of the dried sediments was analyzed using ICP and the achieved findings are listed in Table S2. The sol-gel along with the heat approach was used to prepare the catalyst (Liu et al., 2018). To do this, Solution #1 and #2 were prepared as follows: Solution #1: 12 mL of titanium isopropoxide was poured drop by drop into 2 mL ethanol (C2H5OH) and mixed for 0.5 h. Solution #2: 0.4 mL HNO3 and 2 mL distilled H2O were mixed with 17 mL C2H5OH. Solution #2 was added to Solution #1 drop by drop (3 mL/min) and mixed for 1 h to obtain a colorless sol. Two grams of dried wasted sediment were added to the colorless sol and agitated for 30 min. After that, the resulting mixture was placed in the laboratory room for one day. To vaporize the alcohol content and prevent exploding the catalyst in the furnace, the ultimate solution was first placed at 80 °C for 6 h. The dried solution was then heated at 500 °C for 2 h. The photocatalyst was powdered and used in the cephalexin removal tests."
5,Measurements,"2.4 Measurements FE-SEM photos of the photocatalyst samples were taken by an electronic scanning device (German company ZEISS, model SIGMA VP). The specific surface area of the material was determined using the automatic accelerometer BET (Micrometric, ASAP, 2020). Active chemical groups were measured by an FTIR device (Tensor Model II, manufactured by Bruker-Germany). To determine the crystalline structure of the catalyst, X-ray reflection patterns (XRD, Pert Pro ’X, Panalytical Co.) was used at 40 mA and 40 kV. EDX-mapping (Oxford Instrument) was also utilized to examine the chemical compound of the samples. The COD parameter (HACH spectrophotometer model DR6000) was performed by the photometric method (λ: 620 nm) after intervention removal. The ICP-OES device (730-ES, Varian) was applied to detect the metals in the dried-wasted sediment."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Properties of the photocatalyst,"3.1 Properties of the photocatalyst The FTIR spectrum of the optimal photocatalyst is shown in Fig. 1 A. The wavelength of 2320 cm−1 corresponds to the carbon dioxide in the FTIR device. The wide peak at 1418 cm−1 is linked to the C–H flexural vibration (Basaldella and Legnoverde, 2010) and CC in aromatic rings (Javidparvar et al., 2019b), which may have interfered with the C–H peak and caused the expansion. The peaks were also detected at the wavenumber of 1047 cm−1 (C–N bond) (Ramezanzadeh et al., 2018), 871 cm−1 (O–H bond outside the plate) (Zhang et al., 2008), and 711 cm−1 (C–S bond). The intensity of these peaks is exacerbated after the cephalexin removal, which indicates the reaction of CEP or intermediates with the catalyst. Wide peaks at the wavenumbers >800 cm−1 are correlated to metal oxide (like TiO2) (Miao et al., 2016). Decreasing the peak intensity for the utilized catalyst can reflect the binding of the CEP's molecules to the catalyst and the reaction of CO and metals in the sediment (Tavasol et al., 2020). Fig. 1A also shows two weak peaks at 2980 cm−1 (symmetrical tensile vibrations of C–H) and 2890 cm−1 (asymmetrical tensile vibrations of C–H) in the photocatalyst (Javidparvar et al., 2019a). The XRD spectra of the fresh and utilized photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 1B. The two XRD spectra have almost identical peaks. The compounds of CaCO₃ (Ref. #01-086-2334), SiO2 (Ref. # 01-077-1060), and TiO2 (Ref. #01-075-1582) are identifiable in the photocatalysts. Distributed peaks show the phases of anatase (Aram et al., 2020) and the Rutile of TiO2 (Bansal and Verma, 2018b). A comparison of the two XRD spectra also showed that the peak intensity has reduced in the used photocatalyst. This decrease could be due to a coating of cephalexin molecules (or its intermediates) on the photocatalyst (Tavasol et al., 2020). In Fig. 1B, the catalysts peak used for the catalyst is wider than the fresh type which indicates that the pollutant (cephalexin) is sitting on the photocatalyst. Also, the peaks widening signify a reduction in the crystal size of TiO2. Scherrer relationship was utilized to compute the crystal diameter (D, nm). (1) D = K λ / B cos ( θ ) In this formula, λ is the wavelength of X-ray (i.e., 1.54 Å), K is the factor of shape (≈0.9), B is the maximum intensity of peak at half altitude, and θ is the Bragg angle. The amount of TiO2 crystalline size was about 17.68 nm for the wasted sediment-titanium catalyst. In a study (Ajoudanian and Nezamzadeh-Ejhieh, 2015), the mean crystal size of the NiO–NCP catalyst to remove cephalexin was 40–70 nm. In our study, the crystal size of the wasted sediment-titanium catalyst is smaller compared to this study. As the crystal size decreases, the area will increase, which results in an increase in the active locations at the photocatalyst, thus promoting its activity (Kaur et al., 2018). In the photocatalyst of this study, the low size of crystalline particles (17.68 nm) has led to an increase in surface area and promote photocatalytic activity, which is most effective in removing pollutants. The morphology changes of the wasted sediment modified with titanium before and after the sonophotic reaction have been shown in Fig. 2 . As depicted in Fig. 2, photocatalyst particles have different sizes and white agglomeration with spherical shapes and the average size of 37–58 nm. White round particles might be due to the reaction of elements (Ti, Cl, Mg, Al, Ca, Si, Fe, Zn, S, Na, and K) in sea sediment with TiO2 (Tavasol et al., 2020). Fig. 2 also shows the photocatalyst particles after the reaction. In the used catalyst, there are irregularly crystalline with a small accumulation and the network of uniform particles with a mean diameter of 52–94 nm. According to the images of the pristine photocatalyst (Fig. 2), the presence of high amounts of calcium and metals like magnesium, zinc, copper, and aluminum along with chlorine and sodium, confirm the presence of sea sediment, which could play a photocatalytic role in cephalexin removal. Also, according to the XRD & Mapping tests, the presence of titanium in the catalyst has been strongly confirmed (Tavasol et al., 2020). The results of EDX- Mapping analysis after reaction are illustrated in Fig. 2. According to the post-reaction results, the weight percentage of C, S, N, and especially oxygen (O) compared to the pre-reaction sample incremented remarkably and the level of Ti and other metals in sea sediment catalyst diminished. This confirms the significant interaction of the CEP antibiotic and the photocatalyst surface (Tavasol et al., 2020). The BET and BJH results for the studied photocatalyst are shown in Fig. 3 . The BET area of the photocatalyst before the reaction was obtained at 52.29 m2/g. The relatively high BET area of the generated catalyst is associated with the interaction of Mo and Mn (Sun et al., 2018) and other elements in the sea sediment (Pinto et al., 2018). The high surface area of the activator is an affecting factor for the progress of the reaction with contaminants. The rate of the specific surface area obtained after sonophoto-catalytic process was 58.91 m2/g. Increased catalyst surface after the reaction might be caused by free radicals. The external surface area for the fresh photocatalyst was 51.07 m2/g, which can be linked to the increasing in titanium (Mogyorósi et al., 2003). Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm and the corresponding pore diameter of the photocatalyst is shown in Fig. 3. The photocatalyst isotherm belongs to type IV. This type linked to mesoporous particles. There is a large ring of hysteresis at high P/P0 (type H1), in which the agglomerate particles or ball-shaped particles are ordered in a cylindrical shape. Based on the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller model (BET) and the IUPAC classification, this type of hysteresis represents materials with cylindrical openings at the two ends (Mashayekh-Salehi et al., 2017). The relative pressure (P/P0) at 0.5–0.95 indicates the mesoporous nature of the photocatalyst cavities, which is due to the accumulation of crystals and the interconnection of the internal spaces of the fine crystals (Rostamizadeh and Yaripour, 2016). The N2 adsorption capacity increased rapidly after the relative pressure of 0.5 and sudden changes in the P/P0 value of 0.6–0.8 due to the nitrogen capillary density. The construction parameters of the pores, such as the size have decreased, indicating that the TiO2 deposition on the surface of the sea sediment photocatalyst causes the clogging of the photocatalyst pores. Also, TiO2 particles may not only settle inside the internal cavities of the sea sediment but also cover the surface (Tavasol et al., 2020). The BJH model was used to calculate the pores volume of the photocatalyst and the acquired findings are represented in the inset image in Fig. 3. Also, according to Fig. 3, most of the particle cavities have a diameter between 10 and 20 nm, which indicates the photocatalyst is mesoporous."
8,pH effect,"3.2 pH effect Fig. 4A shows the influence of pH on the cephalexin removal in the sonophoto-catalytic reaction with H2O2 in the pH range of 3–9. Examination of the effect of solution pH on cephalexin degradation showed that the sonophoto-catalytic process with H2O2 had a higher efficiency in pH close to neutral. The cephalexin removal was initially increased at pH 3 and then decreased. At pH 8, the best removal rate (87.01%) was seen. Again, at the pH of 9, cephalexin elimination was decreased to 78.84%. The type of radical varies at different pHs. Accordingly, different yields of antibiotic degradation were achieved (Yang et al., 2019). The water pH affects the rate of degradation through absorbing the compound at the TiO2 surface which has an amphoteric property. Thus, a negative or positive charge can create on the TiO2 surface (Verma et al., 2013). Also, the water pH affected the acidic-basic character of CEP being a zwitterion compound (Ghodbane and Hamdaoui, 2009). Cephalexin (CEP) is a non-volatile molecule. In the sonophoto-catalytic degradation, cavitation and bubble interference occurred where the hydroxyl concentration is highest. Changes in pH cause changes in the hydrophobic properties of CEP, because CEP is neutral (zwitterion). Therefore, cephalexin is present at the highest content on the bubble and is easily attacked by ·OH. At higher and lower pHs, CEP is mainly present in an anionic or cationic state in the water. Thus, the solubility and hydrophilicity of CEP increase. As a result, the decomposition takes place in the solution bulk, where the content of ·OH is lower. Only 10% of ·OH produced in the bubble can penetrate the solvent mass (Goel et al., 2004). Also, high pH levels may cause more radical abduction and reduce radical hydroxyl (·OH) concentration (Wang et al., 2009). It is the reason for decreasing in cephalexin removal at a higher pH (Guo et al., 2010). At high pHs, negative OH− ions predominate over photocatalytic sites and its surface becomes more negative. Accordingly, the attraction between cephalexin cations and photocatalyst increases. However, with decreasing pH, the positive H+ ions are more pronounced at the photocatalyst surface and the repulsive force between cephalexin cations and the catalyst increases, and less removal occurs (Mahramanlioglu et al., 2002). According to the published study (Ejhieh and Khorsandi, 2010), two processes may occur at high –OH concentrations. First, ·OH reacts with OH‾, producing radical H2O2 • and HO2 •. The potential of these radicals to react with pollutants is lower than ·OH. Second, due to the high content of ·OH radicals, radical reactions occur. In general, inactive ·OH has been reported at high pH (Ejhieh and Khorsandi, 2010). Therefore, at pH of 8, the reaction of cephalexin molecules and sonophoto-catalyst has the best result (Nezamzadeh-Ejhieh and Amiri, 2013). As the highest degradation of contaminant occurred at pH 8, we conclude that cephalexin anionic form is more unstable than neutral one at pHs <7, and therefore more degradation has been occurred. At low pH, iron is leached from sea sediment-titanate (according to the ICP test). Thus, the simultaneous effect of photoFenton with the sonophoto-catalytic process leads to the production of higher amount of ·OH, which increases the CEP removal rate at low pH of 3. As it is observed from Fig. 4 A, the pH of the purified solutions is approached to neutral. This can be useful because all the sewage must be neutral to discharge into the environment. Other pHs have also been shown to be neutral, indicating that the sea sediment catalyst/titanium is amphoteric."
9,H2O2 effect,"3.3 H2O2 effect Fig. 4B shows the effect of hydrogen peroxide at different doses of 1.63, 10, 40, 100, 150, and 250 mg/L. The highest removal rate (87.01%.) was observed for 1.63 mg/L H2O2, which has been due to the increased production of hydroxyl radicals (Bansal and Verma, 2018a). Research has also shown that •OH is the predominant species in the photo-based AOSs (Lou et al., 2017). With the increase in hydrogen peroxide content, the removal of cephalexin has been declining. The produced hydroxyl radicals are converted to H2O2 at higher concentrations. High H2O2 doses play a negative role (Azimi and Nezamzadeh-Ejhieh, 2015; Bansal et al., 2017). According to a study (Bansal et al., 2017), it can be understood that increasing H2O2 doses not directly contribute to the photocatalytic process. Therefore, increasing degradation by increasing the dose of hydrogen peroxide to a certain extent is desirable (Nezamzadeh-Ejhieh and Amiri, 2013; Bansal and Verma, 2018b). According to the literature (Bansal et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2019), adding an oxidant such as hydrogen peroxide to an optical degradation system increases the rate of pollutant degradation. The effect of hydrogen peroxide on the removal percentage has been proven to be different (Azimi and Nezamzadeh-Ejhieh, 2015; Bansal et al., 2017). High levels of H2O2 on the photocatalytic surface can be absorbed by the light and reduce the removal of contaminants due to excessive reaction of H2O2 with OH radicals (Nezamzadeh-Ejhieh and Amiri, 2013) and can effectively disrupt OH radicals (Nezamzadeh-Ejhieh and Amiri, 2013). Hydrogen peroxide/electron acceptor can also increase the OH radical concentration in the photocatalytic purification process, thereby disrupting the electron combination of the cavity (Verma et al., 2013). The electron generated from the bond accepts the transfer and thus enhances the charge separation, as well as forming ·OH. However, H2O2 acts as a scavenger at high concentrations (Verma et al., 2013) and changes to less reactive species of ·OOH (Rayaroth et al., 2016). In addition to competing with active compounds over electrons, the competition of radicals against target pollutants can also lead to less pollution than expected (Mijin et al., 2009; Nezamzadeh-Ejhieh and Amiri, 2013). In our study, the hydrogen peroxide will be increasing due to the competition of mediated compounds produced by cephalexin during sonophoto-catalytic process and the competition of these compounds to react with hydroxyl radicals. After a certain concentration of H2O2, there is a little progress in the yield of photo-decomposition for aromatic compounds (Nezamzadeh-Ejhieh and Amiri, 2013). Therefore, determining the optimal value of H2O2 is important. According to the results, 1.63 mg/L H2O2 was obtained as the optimal concentration."
10,Photocatalyst dose effect,"3.4 Photocatalyst dose effect The impact of the photocatalyst mass (0.1–5 g/L) on CEP degradation was explored and the results are presented in Fig. 4C. Increasing the photocatalyst dose from 0.1 to 1.5 g/L led to a growth in CEP pollutant degradation, and the maximum degradation efficiency was achieved at a dose of 1.5 g/L with a removal rate of 87.01%. The elimination efficiency was reduced at higher doses. This trend has also been reported in other studies (Ajoudanian and Nezamzadeh-Ejhieh, 2015; Yang et al., 2019). In fact, at a relatively low photocatalyst dose has a less oxidizing ability (Yang et al., 2019). As the mass of photocatalyst increases, the rate of decomposition increases due to the growth of active semiconductor sites accessible for photons (Yang et al., 2019) and thus the generation of more hydroxyl radicals. It is notable that the higher doses of the photocatalyst has a negative effect through suppress the transmission of UV light in the suspension, which lead to less photon reaching the photocatalyst and reduce deletion efficiency (Nezamzadeh-Ejhieh and Amiri, 2013; Azimi and Nezamzadeh-Ejhieh, 2015). The higher density of the photocatalytic particle may also be an increase in the UV light scattering by the particles (Yang et al., 2019). Our study is consistent with other researches (Verma et al., 2013) because with increasing photocatalyst concentration, the rate of the photocatalytic process increases and then decreases. The excessive quantity of wasted sediment/titanium has a high iron content of 0.52% (by weight). Iron probably causes the scavenging effect of OH radicals (Bansal et al., 2018) and affected the CEP degradation by the following reactions (Yang et al., 2019): (2) Fe3+ + hν → Fe2+- (3) CEP− Fe3+ + hν → CEP − Fe2+-"
11,Effect of reaction time-cephalexin concentration and process kinetics,"3.5 Effect of reaction time-cephalexin concentration and process kinetics Fig. 5 A shows the effect of the initial concentration of CEP against different times on the rate of cephalexin degradation. As can be seen, the concentration of the reactant affects the rate of the reaction. The extent of pollutant degradation has been reduced from 50 mg/L to 300 mg/L. As a result, mass transfer is restricted when the CEP content in the solution is high. At high initial concentrations of cephalexin, mass transfer is restricted, so the reaction rate is low (Fig. 5A). The result is similar to those reported for the removal of pesticides (Stephan et al., 2011) and antibiotics (Lou et al., 2017) in the wastewater. At high concentrations of cephalexin, more CEP molecules are absorbed on the catalyst, and more ·OH or ·O2− radicals are required to decompose the contaminant. As the radical formation of the catalyst is constant and therefore, produced radicals are not sufficient to decompose high concentrations of pollutants and decrease decomposition (Ajoudanian and Nezamzadeh-Ejhieh, 2015). At higher concentrations, CEP molecules react more with the photocatalyst surface, which has an inhibitory effect on the decomposition progress (Liu et al., 2013), because titanium is less likely to be excited. The high doses of CEP molecules can also absorb the main part of the input photons and cause fewer production of •OH (Azimi and Nezamzadeh-Ejhieh, 2015). This reduces the decontamination efficiency by the photo-degradation process. There are two possible reasons for the effect of primary pollutant concentrations: - Many organic pollutants absorb ultraviolet radiation. As the concentration of the contaminant increases, the UV penetration into the water decreases, so that the effect of the internal filter is created. At the same time, not only the CEP removal prohibited but also the decomposition of peroxides is reduced, thus, the pollutant degradation is reduced (Ao and Liu, 2017; Yang et al., 2019). - High concentrations of pollutants increase the production of intermediates, which consume some of the produced radicals (Yang et al., 2019). In general, at a constant oxidant concentration, as the concentration of the pollutant will high, the level of pollutant degradation will decrease (Hazime et al., 2013; Ao and Liu, 2017). Similar phenomena have been observed in the degradation of drugs on various UV-based AOSs (Yang et al., 2019). Photocatalytic oxidation of various organic pollutants on TiO2 under radiation follows the first-order kinetic model: (4) − d C E P d t = k . C E P (5) l n C E P 0 C E P = k . t Drawing ln CEP0/CEP versus time shows a straight line where the slope on linear regression is equal to k (constant rate of the first-order kinetic). In other studies, a linear relationship has been observed between CEP concentration and the time of degradation. Based on the constant rate in Fig. 5B, the best degradation rate for cephalexin is 0.031 min−1. A study on tetracycline and cephalexin removal by a photocatalytic process (Azimi and Nezamzadeh-Ejhieh, 2015) and also the study on cephalexin and metronidazole elimination using the Urea/TiO2/ZnFe2O4/Clinoptiloite (Aram et al., 2020) have been followed the first-order kinetic. According to the degradation rate in Fig. 5B, the removal rate of 50 mg/L CEP was 4 times higher than that of 300 mg/L CEP. The constant kinetic rate for cephalexin degradation was 0.019, 0.015, and 0.01 min−1 for cephalexin concentrations of 100, 200, and 300 mg/L and its correlation coefficient (R2) was 0.9433, 0.9413, and 0.9588, respectively."
12,UV power effect,"3.6 UV power effect The effect of ultraviolet light intensity (6, 15, and 25 W/m2) on the cephalexin degradation was evaluated at optimal factors using wasted sediment-titanate/UV/US/H2O2. The findings are depicted in Fig. 6 . This figure shows a slight increase in the percentage of COD removal with growing light intensity for a particular CEP concentration. The removal efficiency of a 15 W/m2 UV lamp is higher than that of a 6 W/m2 UV lamp. Because higher UV intensity provides more energy to activate titanium and generate electron-hole pairs (Lou et al., 2017). The UV intensity is an essential factor in the destruction of antibiotics because electron-cavities are produced by UV light (Lou et al., 2017). The effect of UV light intensity on the rate of CEP destruction (r) can be modeled based on the following formula (Assadi et al., 2013): (6) r = k a p p ∗ ( I ) α At low UV intensity (here, I), the α quantity is ≈ 1, providing the first degree (kapp) of reactive degradation (Assadi et al., 2013). The degree of reaction decreased with the increasing intensity of ultraviolet light. Fig. 6 illustrates that the rate of cephalexin degradation increases with ultraviolet radiation initially following the first-order reaction. This finding implies an almost linear relationship between the UV light intensity and the constant kinetic of cephalexin degradation. Therefore, the use of electron-hole pairs is performed at a slower rate by chemical reactions than recombination (Lou et al., 2017). On the other hand, in a UV intensity of 25 W/m2, the removal of cephalexin has decreased to 79.8% compared to that of 15 W/m2 with a removal rate of 87.01%. This phenomenon can be due to the production of electron pairs (e/h+) in TiO2 level which is absorbed by UV photons. The recombination of electron cavities lowered the catalysis rate which is a weakness of TiO2 (Lou et al., 2017) and is very clear in this experiment. Also, the reason for the decrease in the removal percentage in UV intensity of 6 W/m2 and 25 W/m2 compared to 15 W/m2 can be attributed to the decrease in pH during the sonophoto-catalytic reaction. Due to the high amount of ·OH radicals and the synergistic properties of the sonophoto-catalytic process, the possibility of radical scavengers has occurred which will consequently reduce the percentage of CEP removal in 25 W/m2 radiation (Nezamzadeh-Ejhieh and Amiri, 2013)."
13,Effect of system components and comparison of photocatalyst with other catalysts,"3.7 Effect of system components and comparison of photocatalyst with other catalysts To confirm the prominence of the multiple effects of the system components developed in this study, experiments were performed using different modes of the developed process at the optimal conditions (Fig. 7 ). Cephalexin removal by using studied system components including, wasted sediment-titanate, UV, H2O2, US, wasted sediment-titanate/H2O2, wasted sediment-titanate/UV, and wasted sediment-titanate/US were evaluated. Also, the zeolite-titanate, MgO, and clay-titanate was synthesized and then incorporated with UV/US/H2O2 and tested to evaluate the effectiveness of the studied photocatalyst (wasted sediment-titanate). The achieved findings are illustrated in Fig. 7. As depicted in Fig. 7, it can be concluded that the synergistic effect of the photocatalyst/UV/US/H2O2 method had the highest removal percentage (87%) compared to other methods. At equal conditions, the CEP removal efficiency for clay-titanium/UV/US/H2O2 and zeolite-titanium/UV/US/H2O2 methods was about 68% and 70%, respectively. The developed photocatalyst can form by the Schottky barrier between the metal in the wasted sediment and TiO2 which acts as an electron trapper and prevents the electron returns to cavity. Therefore, metal nanoparticles, as an electron sinker, increase the tendency to suppress recombination of the charge carriers, the tendency to produce free radicals that lead to photooxidation of various organic pollutants (Jaafar et al., 2015; Mishra et al., 2018). With the TiO2/UV/US/H2O2 system, a relatively suitable efficiency (79%) of pollutant removal was obtained. But the efficiency was less than that of obtained by the main system (wasted sediment-titanium/UV/US/H2O2). The use of the TiO2 solution form in the treatment can lead to its presence in the reactor outlet, which will probably have environmental effects. Also, the modified clay and zeolite with TiO2 may not have this wasted sediment property and therefore, had a lower removal efficiency than the sea sediment-titanium. Zeolite-titanate/UV/US/H2O2 has removed 70.01% of cephalexin and played less role in cephalexin removal than the developed photocatalyst. However, zeolite's role in the CEP removal may be linked to the high surface area and pores of zeolite (Nezamzadeh-Ejhieh and Amiri, 2013). With the ‘US + photocatalyst’ method, the removal percentage was 41.24%, which was almost similar to a study in the removal of 4-chloro-2-nitrophenol pollutants by the same method (Verma et al., 2013). The removal percentage of cephalexin with a photocatalyst, US, and UV was 32.54, 9.11, and 3, respectively. In a study (De la Cruz et al., 2012), the overall destruction of micro-pollutants after 10 min with UV254 radiation was only 46%. The decontamination percentage of 4-chloro-2-nitro phenol using TiO2 was only 9% (Verma et al., 2013). The destruction of pollutants by direct photolysis largely depends on the desired composition (Kim et al., 2009) and other parameters such as permeability cross-sectional area, product quantum process, photon flow velocity at the excitation wavelength, and the content of dissolved molecular oxygen (Legrini et al., 1993). Also, the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the aqueous solution can reduce the possibility of direct and indirect UV photolysis (De la Cruz et al., 2012). Therefore, these reasons may also cause less destruction of cephalexin under UV radiation by 3%. According to Fig. 7, the removal of cephalexin contaminant in ‘UV + photocatalyst’ and ‘H2O2+ photocatalyst’ methods was obtained 49.58% and 45.89%, respectively. This shows that the ‘UV + photocatalyst’ process has been more efficient than the ‘H2O2+ photocatalyst’ process in removing the contaminant by 7.04%. This finding is consistent with other studies (Rodrigues-Silva et al., 2013; Lou et al., 2017). As most drugs are photoactive and therefore absorb light, the presence of UV can be effective in the CEP removal. According to various studies, several active drug compounds can be decomposed by light, because they contain aromatic rings, heterogeneous, and functional groups, can absorb radiation, and produce a reaction with photons that stimulate their degradability in the water (Rivera-Utrilla et al., 2013). The photocatalyst alone, ‘US + photocatalyst’, and ‘UV + photocatalyst’ had a CEP removal percentage of 32.54%, 41.24%, and 49.58%, respectively. The absorption of light by TiO2 causes the formation of Ti3+ for empty O, which prevents the recombination of e−/h+ in TiO2 (Lou et al., 2017). The decrease in CEP removal by the sediment-titanate by 32.54% is due to the precipitation of CEP on the wasted sediment-TiO2 surface, thus stopping almost all active photocatalyst sites that cause further adsorption of CEP. Similarly, when the H2O2 test was performed alone, only 6.12% of CEP was removed. It is due to the insufficient production of hydroxyl radicals (Bansal et al., 2018). In this study, •OH is produced not only by the heterogeneous wasted sediment-titanate and the ultrasonic process but also by the homogeneous process of photo-Fenton (iron and other elements leaked from the sediment). They are also increase the destruction rate (Tavasol et al., 2020). According to Fig. 7, the elimination order of the studied processes is as follows:photocatalyst/UV/US/H 2O2˃ TiO2/UV/US/H2O2˃ MgO/UV/US/H2O2˃ zeolite-titanate/UV/US/H2O2 ˃clay-titanate/UV/US/H2O2 ˃photocatalyst. Therefore, ultrasound waves significantly improved the rate of photocatalytic degradation. Ultrasound stimulates the absorption of organic matter and mediators from the photocatalyst onto the solution (Babu et al., 2016) and thus increase the availability of catalyst surface. On the other hand, sonication increases the number of cavities on the catalyst. Thus, increasing the cumulative pressure (the number of cavities produced by the pressure drop caused by a single cavity) and at higher power levels (Sivakumar and Pandit, 2001) will leads to a corresponding increase in CEP degradation (Guo et al., 2010). Studies have shown that sonophoto-catalytic degradation leads to faster degradation of pollutants than a separate process under similar conditions. Ultrasound waves increase fluid turbulence conditions; therefore, increasing the mass transfer between the liquid and the catalyst surface. Catalyst fragmentation and non-agglomeration increase the emission rate of pollutants. The main mechanism for both ultrasound and photocatalytic oxidation is the production of free and active H• and ·OH radicals. If these beam modes are combined, the number of radicals will be more available for the reaction (Verma et al., 2013). Numerous studies have provided the notion of synergism between photo- and sono-catalysis processes (Selli, 2002)."
14,Effect of anions and water matrix,"3.8 Effect of anions and water matrix At this stage, the effect of anions (NaCl, NaNO3, and Na2SO4) on the elimination of cephalexin was investigated. The results are presented in Fig. 8 . As can be seen, with a specific initial concentration (100 mg/L) of Cl‾, NO3‾, and SO4 2− anions in cephalexin solution, the removal percentage was obtained 89.79, 82.25, and 81.59%, respectively. Many researchers have examined the role of water impurities in sono-degradation (Rayaroth et al., 2016). Mineral ions can increase or decrease the degradation rate, which depends on the contaminant nature and the reaction of the ions with ·OH (Rayaroth et al., 2016). In the case of chloride ions, the percentage of cephalexin removal was increased by 2.78% compared to the absence of ions, possibly due to the production of Cl2 • ‾ and Cl•, although they have a less reactive than ·OH (Nguyen et al., 2011). The rate of destruction of sulfamethoxazole (Ao and Liu, 2017) and carbamazepine (Deng et al., 2013) increased in the presence of 30–100 mM Cl−, which is consistent with our study. The amount of nitrate ion in the solution caused a relative decrease in cephalexin destruction by 81.59% compared to the controlled solution (87.01%). The NO3 ‾ ions have negative and positive effects on the photocatalysis reactions. NO3 ‾ can uptake UV photon, so it may act as an internal filter to block ultraviolet radiation from transmitting light to the aqueous solution (Yuan et al., 2011). Although the radical reaction of NO3 −• may be considered, due to the oxidation potential, however, its reactivity is less than that of ·OH (Nguyen et al., 2011). Based on Fig. 8A, the degradation efficiency in the co-existence of sulfate ions has reduced due to the consumption of electrons by this anion that reduce hydroxyl radicals (Nezamzadeh-Ejhieh and Amiri, 2013). Sulfate radicals can degrade cephalexin molecules, but their activity rate is low. These observations are in line with published works (Ghaly et al., 2007; Nezamzadeh-Ejhieh and Amiri, 2013). In a study, the presence of NO3 − (0.340 μM/min), Cl− (0.351 μM/min), and SO4 2− (0.368 μM/min) have hindered the progress of the reaction (Rayaroth et al., 2016). Anions can block active sites on the photocatalytic surface and inactivate catalyst degradation (Nezamzadeh-Ejhieh and Amiri, 2013). In this study, different anions can reduce degradation efficiency. The behavior of the studied anions on the CEP removal can be ranked as Cl− ≥ without ions ≥ SO4 −2 ≥NO3 −. Therefore, the presence of salts led to a reduction in the rate of destruction of pollutants. Cephalexin was added to tap water and wastewater samples and then its reduction was tested in the developed system (Fig. 8B). The cephalexin removal rate from tap water media was attained 76.21%, which was reduced compared to the control solution. The anions in the tap water have inhibitory effects on the optical degradation process if combined with semiconductors (Ghaly et al., 2007). Water compounds generally tend to scavenge reactive species and suppress elimination efficiency (Rayaroth et al., 2016). On the other hand, the competition of the anions with CEP to react with ·OH and prohibits photo-catalytic degradation (Rayaroth et al., 2016). In other studies, chloride ions reduced the rate of degradation (Rao et al., 2016). The destruction of ketoprofen in the UV/PS system has been shown to significantly reduce Kobs in brackish and saline water (Yang et al., 2019), which is consistent with the study. The elimination of CEP from a hospital wastewater sample was also investigated. The sewage sample was provided from the chlorinated sewage output of a hospital in Bushehr (Iran) and tested in the laboratory after filtration. The results are presented in Fig. 8B. Two types of spike and non-spike samples with CEP were examined and the COD removal of 63.27% and 86.24% were obtained, respectively. Compared to the control solution (87.01%), the elimination percentage is relatively low. The organic matter in hospital wastewater can reduce active UV light (Yuan et al., 2011). Reducing the rate of cephalexin removal in hospital wastewater in both cases compared to the control state can be attributed to the higher concentration of soluble organic carbon (DOC), nitrate, sulfate, and chloride in the hospital wastewater, as most radical ·OH scavenger (Yuan et al., 2011). According to a study (Yuan et al., 2011), the direct photolysis oxytetracycline and deoxycillin antibiotics in natural waters decreased compared to deionized water. The hospital wastewater pH during the experiment was 8.31, and according to pH studies, there was a decrease in efficiency of CEP removal at pH above 8. At high concentrations of OH−, ·OH may react with OH‾ and produce radicals of H2O• 2 and HO• 2 (Ejhieh and Khorsandi, 2010), which their activity is less than ·OH. In general, inactive ·OH has been reported at high pH (Nezamzadeh-Ejhieh and Amiri, 2013)."
15,Energy analysis,"3.9 Energy analysis AOSs consume electrical energy (EE) because of the equipment used in them. In this regard, EE can provide useful information to determine the required energy in any process based on the electrical energy consumed. EE (kW⋅h/m3) is calculated using the following formula (Miklos et al., 2018): (7) E E = P ∗ t ∗ 1000 V ∗ 60 ∗ lg ( C E P i n i t i a l C E P f i n a l ) where P implies the input of the required electrical energy in AOS (kW), t implies the treatment time (min), and V implies the liquid volume (L). Then, the particular energy consumption (PEC) for the process is computed using Eq. (8) (Miklos et al., 2018): (8) P E C = ∑ P ∗ t ( C 0 − C f ) ∗ V Based on Eq. (7), the EE factor to reduce COD from distilled water by the wasted sediment-titanate/UV/US/H2O2 system was 0.031 kW h/m3. On the other hand, the PEC parameter of the system was computed using Eq. (8) to be 0.153 W h.The results are consistent with the study of high levels of COD removal from synthesized cephalexin solution using the H2O2/sonophoto process (Poblete and Pérez, 2020)."
16,Photocatalyst reclimation,"3.10 Photocatalyst reclimation The photocatalyst was reclimed 5 times. This test was performed under optimal conditions. After each use, the resulting catalyst was placed in a furnace at 150 °C to remove organic matter from the surface. The photocatalyst was then immersed in deionized water and then dried at 105 °C for 4 h. As depicted in Fig. S2, the efficiency is still high until the fourth reuse. However, in the fifth stage, the efficiency has decreased, which may have been due to the destruction of the photocatalyst surface."
17,Conclusion,"In this study, the wasted sediment was first modified with titanium by thermal and sol-gel methods and used as a photocatalyst for the cephalexin removal in the presence of UV, US, and H2O2. The amount of TiO2 crystalline size for the sediment-titanium catalyst was about 17.68 nm. The optimal CEP removal using wasted sediment-titanate/US/UV/H2O2 was obtained at hydrogen peroxide of 1.63 mg/L, pH 8, and photocatalyst dose of 1.5 g/L. The UV light with the intensity of 15 W/m2 had the highest efficiency. The components of wasted sediment-titanate/US/UV/H2O2 were evaluated individually and in combination, and the effectiveness of the photocatalyst was compared with other catalysts like zeolite, clay, and magnesium oxide. The two ions of sulfate and nitrate reduced the cephalexin removal efficiency and chloride had an increasing effect. In tap water and sewage, the rate of elimination of pollutants has been reduced. The electrical energy (EE) for sediment-titanate/US/UV/H2O2 system was computed to be 0.031 kW h/m3. The photocatalyst of this study (wasted sediment-titanate) has a good catalytic role for decomposing anibiotic like CEP from wastewater."
