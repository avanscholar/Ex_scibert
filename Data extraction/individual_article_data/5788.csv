0,Introduction,"Isopoly- and heteropoly-oxometallates of Keggin and Dawson-type have been well recognized as efficient catalyst in numerous chemical processes in gas–solid, liquid–solid and liquid systems [1–8]. Some compounds from this group are also capable of catalyzing the electrooxidation of organic substances such as methanol [9,10], NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, reduced form) coenzymes as well as l-cysteine on glassy carbon (GC) or fibre carbon (FC) electrodes [11–15]. Furthermore, catalytic action of oxometalates has been demonstrated in electroreduction of inorganic compounds such as nitrate, nitrite, peroxidsulfate, chlorate, bromate, iodate, oxygen, hydrogen peroxide [4,16–34]. Special attention has been devoted to the voltammetric behavior of molybdenum oxo-species introduced into the electrolyte solution and/or embedded into a film deposited on GC or metallic electrodes. The first study in this field concerned the catalytic activity of molybdenum(III) species formed from molybdate ions at the Hg electrode in acidic electrolyte solution in electroreduction of nitrate [23] and of chlorate ions [24] It was postulated that the enhanced reduction current can be used for polarographic determination of these compounds and traces of molybdenum(VI). Later, a remarkable catalytic effect has been observed in the reduction of Br O 3 − and Cl O 3 − ions on a GC electrode modified with phosphomolybdic anion ( PMo 12 O 40 3 − ) [25,26]. A similar phenomenon was found with isopolymolybdic acid entrapped in a polyaniline film [27] and with the molybdotungstate polyanions doped into a polypyrrole film or present in acidic solution at the GC electrodes [28,29]. On the other hand, enhanced reduction of Br O 3 − and Cl O 3 − ions appeared only in the presence of a six electron reduction product of PMo 12 O 40 3 − at Au electrodes [30–32] and on a Pt electrode modified wit silicon dioxide gel doped with 12-molybdophosphoric acid [33]. The same was observed in electroreduction of H2O2 on the latter electrode. Furthermore, some authors have suggested that the reduction of inorganic oxo-anions can be also catalyzed by the non-stoichiometric, mixed valent molybdenum(VI,V) oxides (MoO3−x with 0< x <1) as well as by molybdenum bronzes (H x MoO3 =MoO3−x (OH) x with 0< x <2) electrodeposited on GC or FC carbon electrodes [34]. All the above-mentioned phenomena have been generally explained assuming the EC mechanism involving regeneration of the electroactive species in a chemical reaction coupled to the preceding electron transfer reaction at the electrode/solution interface [25,27,31,32,34]. We have found a substantial enhancement of the reduction rate of alkenes and their hydroxyl-derivatives on a polycrystalline Pt electrode in strongly acidic solutions containing Mo(VI) oxo-species, relative to that obtained when using a supporting electrolyte alone. To the best of our knowledge, no other data on this subject have been published except an announcement that ethene was preferably formed upon electroreduction of ethyne on a Pt electrode coated with a film of poly-3-methylthiophene containing Mo(VI), while the presence of Mo O 4 2 − ions in the 0.1M NaOH solution resulted in a higher production of ethane then ethene [35]. In the present paper, attention is focused on the catalytic effect of Mo(VI) species in electroreduction of AA and vice versa. A detailed recognition of the mechanism of this effect is of primary importance for development of appropriate sensors of high sensitivity for detection of allyl alcohol and Mo(VI) oxo-species. Kinetics of the electroreduction Mo(VI) and of AA alone on the investigated polycrystalline Pt electrode is reported for the sake of comparison. Earlier DEMS (differential electrochemical mass spectrometry) and FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) studies in situ [36] as well as ESR (electron spin resonance spectroscopy) and MS (mass spectrometry) ex situ experiments [37] have shown that the reduction of AA occurring in the hydrogen adsorption/evolution region on porous Pt(PTFE) and Pt/Pt electrodes in acidic solutions results initially in formation of propene and then propane as the main volatile reaction product. Next, an effective hydrogenation of the bulk and adsorbed propene to propane at the Pt(PTFE)/acidic solution interface was proven by quantitative analysis of the mass spectrometric cyclic voltammograms (MSCVs) obtained for a number of m/z values in parallel with the conventional CVs [38]."
1,Experimental,"All electrochemical experiments were performed in a conventional three compartment cell adapted to electrolyte exchange, at room temperature (295K) and under Ar (99.998%) atmosphere. A polycrystalline Pt sheet of geometric area of 0.4cm2 served as the working electrode. A large area Pt sheet was a counter electrode and a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) with 1M HClO4 solution was used as a reference. Prior to each experiment, the working electrode was repeatedly activated in deaerated 1M HClO4 solution by cycling (1–10Vs−1) within the potential range 0.025–1.6V, until a reproducible voltammogram was obtained. Finally the roughness factor of Pt (2.4±0.2) was determined from the charge corresponding to the hydrogen adsorption and/or desorption, according to the well-known procedure, assuming that a hydrogen monolayer requires 0.24mCcm−2. Potentiodynamic measurements were carried out with a computerized 9431EI potentiostat–galvanostat (Atlas-Sollich, Poland) equipped with an IR drop correction system and connected to a 9515 signal generator working in the programmable potential sequence in the triangular potential sweep (TPS) mode with appropriate changes in the potential range, number of cycles and scan rates as well as after holding the electrode potential at various constant values for various periods of time. Current–potential–time dependencies were recorded and analyzed with a computer-based system equipped with a MC112-12 interface (Mescomp, Poland). All the obtained I–E dependencies were analyzed using a self-made program written in Pascal. The faradaic charge related to the electroreduction (Q Red) and/or electrooxidation of molybdenum and/or organic species (Q Ox) was determined by integration of the respective CVs, recorded in the first and subsequent cycles. The charge corresponding to the double layer or that corresponding to the oxide layer formation in a supporting electrolyte was always subtracted from the total charge involved in the electrode process investigated. The adsorption experiments were performed according to the following procedure. After cycling the Pt electrode in the deaerated supporting electrolyte solution containing AA and desorption of residues at 1.6V for 5ms, the electrode potential was switched to a constant value (E ad) for a given period of time (t ad). Next, after replacement of the solution investigated by pure supporting electrolyte under potential control, the strongly adsorbed species remaining on the Pt surface were oxidized or reduced during the first positive or negative going potential scan, respectively. The adsorption time of 120s ensured a maximum coverage of the Pt surface with the adsorbate. The potentiodynamic profile of a blank Pt electrode was obtained in the second or third potential cycle. The relative coverage of the electrode surface with the adsorbed AA species (Θ) was evaluated according to the procedure described in our earlier paper [39], from the difference (ΔQ H) between the charge related to the hydrogen desorption at Pt in the supporting electrolyte ( Q H ° ) and after adsorption of the compounds investigated (Q H), using the expression: Θ = Δ Q H / Q H ° = ( Q H ° − Q H ) / Q H ° . The number of electrons transferred per one Pt site upon the oxidative desorption of the surface species was calculated as: n eps = Q ox/ΔQ H. The oxidation state of molybdenum species, remaining on Pt after repetitive cycling for 30min within the potential range 0.4–0.33V and 0.1–0.17V versus NHE (at 0.025Vs−1) in deaerated 4M HClO4 solution containing 2×10−3 M Na2MoO4, was established by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). After the voltammetric procedure in an argon purged glove box, the Pt electrodes were thoroughly rinsed with Millipore Milli-Q water and transferred into an UHV chamber (vacuum below 5×10−8 mbar) of the X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. High resolution XPS spectra were collected using an ESCA 150 spectrometer (VSW Scientific Instruments Ltd., Manchester, England) equipped with an aluminium Kα (1486.6eV, 200W) radiation source, a hemispherical electron energy analyzer (150mm in diameter) operating at a constant pass energy and a Leybold multichannel detector. Further details of XPS experiments have been outlined elsewhere [40]. Data acquisition was made starting from the Mo 3d binding energy region. The XPS binding energy scale was calibrated against the C 1s signal at 284.6eV. Analysis of the obtained XPS spectra was performed using the XPSPEAK 41 peak-fitting program [41] including Shirley background subtraction [42]. All solutions were made with p. A. grade chemicals and Millipore Milli-Q water. The chemicals were used as received: allyl alcohol, perchloric acid suprapur (Merck) and sodium molybdate p. A. (Aldrich). Argon 99.998% (BOC, Poland) served for deaeration and stirring of the investigated solutions."

3,Electrochemical behavior of Mo(VI) oxo-species on a polycrystalline Pt,"3.1 Electrochemical behavior of Mo(VI) oxo-species on a polycrystalline Pt 3.1.1 Electroreduction of Mo(VI) on Pt in 1M HClO4 solution Fig. 1 shows an exemplary CVs obtained for different scan rates (v) on a polycrystalline Pt electrode in 1M HClO4 solution containing Na2MoO4. The electroreduction of Mo(VI) species is manifested by a broad cathodic peak which starts in the negative going scan at the electrode potential of about E ≈0.5V and reaches a maximum (I p,c) at E ≈0.3–0.35V, prior to the beginning of H+ reduction to Had. In the positive going scan it is accompanied by the anodic counterpart (within the potential range 0.25–0.6V) in the form of a sharp symmetric peak characteristic of oxidative desorption of the surface species [43]. The maximum of this peak (I p,a) is centered around 0.4–0.5V for the molybdate concentrations of 5×10−5 M and 5×10−2 M, respectively. One can see in the insert in Fig. 1 that both the electroreduction and the electrooxidation current in the peak maximum increase almost proportionally with v up to 1Vs−1 which was predicted for a surface-confined process [43,44]. The slope of the double logarithmic plot of I p,c and I p,a versus the scan rate is equal to 0.75±0.05 and 0.85±0.05Vdecade−1, respectively. As typical of such a case, stirring of the solution had no influence on the I–E dependencies under the above-mentioned conditions. There is no doubt that the reduced molybdenum oxo-species remain strongly adsorbed on the Pt surface in 1M HClO4 solution until they undergo oxidative desorption in the first positive going scan after reversal of the scan direction. This strong adsorption is indicated by a suppression of the current related to the oxidative desorption of hydrogen from the Pt surface and by an almost equal charge involved in the reduction of molybdenum(VI) species and in the re-oxidation of the reduction product, which was ascertained upon integration of the cathodic and anodic parts of CVs. Some distortion of the CV signal observed in the potential range of the PtOH/PtO layer at E >0.8V, after oxidative stripping of the reduced adsorbate points to a fast re-adsorption of the parent Mo(VI) species on Pt. Unfortunately, due to overlapping of the reductive adsorption of molybdenum species and their oxidative stripping with the adsorption–desorption of hydrogen, it was not possible to determine the electrode coverage with the individual species and/or the number of electrons transferred per one adsorbed molybdenum species. Therefore, the valence state of molybdenum oxo-species present in the surface layer on the investigated Pt electrode at E <0.5V was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (see below). Nevertheless, the fact that the half peak potential of the cathodic peak appearing in the voltammogram of the system investigated at pH 0 (Fig. 1) is close to the value of the standard potential of the Mo(VI)/Mo(V) redox couple (E =0.4V versus SHE [45]) allows the assumption that this CV signal corresponds to one electron reduction of Mo(VI) to Mo(V) species. Consistent with this conclusion is the value of the Tafel slope of approximately dE/dlog I =115±5mVdecade−1, which was obtained in the kinetic range of the I–E curves (0.4V< E <0.5V) irrespectively of the scan rate (from 0.005Vs−1 to 0.1Vs−1) and Mo(VI) concentration in 1M HClO4 solution. Some decrease in the current at each electrode potential in the above-mentioned Tafel range with increasing acid concentration in solution above 1M at a constant Mo(VI) concentration (see peak I in Fig. 3A), resulted in a negative value of the reaction order with respect to H+ ions ( z H + = − 1 ) . This might suggests partial deprotonation of the Mo(VI) species prior to or in the charge-transfer step. 3.1.2 XPS analysis of molybdenum species on a Pt surface As exemplified in Fig. 2 , the XPS spectrum of the surface layer remaining on the working Pt electrode after multiple repetitive potentiodynamic cycling in the potential range between 0.5V and 0.1V exhibits a broadened doublet in the Mo 3d electron binding energy (E B) region, of almost the same shape when using 1M or 4M HClO4 as a base electrolyte. The fitting analysis of the experimental signals permitted identification of two individual Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 doublets (FWHM of 1.8±0.1). In agreement with the E B data reported in the literature [46–48], the doublet with the peak maxima located at E B (3d5/2)=232.5±0.1eV and E B (3d3/2)=235.7±0.1eV corresponds to Mo(VI) species, while the second one centered at E B (3d5/2)=231.6±0.1eV and E B (3d3/2)=234.8±0.1eV can be assigned to Mo(V) states. No indication was found of the presence of Mo (III) and Mo(IV) in the layer deposited on Pt. These results suggest that the parent Mo(VI) surface species converts upon electroreduction into a mixed-valent Mo(V)/Mo(VI) strongly bound adsorbate. According to the literature data, it may include among others isopolyoxomolybdates comprising both Mo(V) and Mo(VI) centers, such as [ M o n V M o 12 − n VI O 40 ] ( 8 + n ) − , [ H x M o n V M o 12 − n VI O 40 ] ( 8 + n − x ) _ , [ M o n V M o 36 − n VI O 112 ] ( 8 + n ) − , and [ H x M o n V M o 36 − n VI O 112 ] ( 8 + n − x ) − [17,20,25,26], as well as molybdenyl molybdate ( Mo V O 2 ) 2 Mo VI O 4 , stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric oxides (Mo2O5, Mo4O10, Mo4O11, MoO3−x with 0< x <1) or molybdenum bronzes (H x MoO3 =MoO3−x (OH) x with 0< x <1), containing inserted protons and incorporated water [34,49]. It should be underlined that the nature of this adsorbate does not change with a shift of the electrode potential in the negative direction up to the hydrogen evolution, albeit some increase in the relative contribution of Mo(V) to Mo(VI) species in the surface layer on Pt was evidenced by an increasing ratio of the integral intensities of the respective doublets in the XPS spectrum. 3.1.3 Influence of acid and molybdate concentration in solution on electroreduction of Mo(VI) oxo-species on Pt It is worth noting that an increase in the HClO4 concentration above 1M at a constant Mo(VI) concentration (1×10−4–5×10−2 M) prompts the onset of a subsequent new reduction process of the molybdenum species, reflected in CVs in Fig. 3(A and B) as the second distinct signal in the form of a flat cathodic peak (II) at E <0.25V following the first cathodic peak (I) in the potential range 0.5–0.25V. When using the 4M HClO4 solution, the limiting current of the cathodic peak II at a given Mo(VI) concentration achieves a maximum value, considerably higher than that of the preceding peak I, whose magnitude remains independent of pH value. The same observation was made with increasing acid concentration for the reaction rate in the kinetic range of peak II (see insert in Fig. 3A). In contrast to peak I which is attributed to the formation of a stable and reoxidizable mixed-valent Mo(V)/Mo(VI) surface layer from preadsorbed Mo(VI) species, cathodic peak II corresponds to the reduction of an electroactive Mo(VI) reactant diffusing from the bulk solution to the electrode surface. As characteristic in such a case [50–54], analysis of the CVs obtained at different scan rates (Fig. 3B) for the molybdate concentration up to 5×10−4 M in 4M HClO4 revealed a linear dependence of the limiting current of peak (II) on the square root of the scan rate from v =0.002Vs−1 to v =0.05Vs−1. Additionally, the diffusive limitation in the electrode process occurring at E <0.25V was reflected in an increase in the peak current upon stirring the solution with the bubbling inert gas. Furthermore, when the potential sweep was reversed from the negative to the positive direction in the potential range of the cathodic peak II, then the coulombic charge involved in the oxidative desorption of the strongly bound reduced molybdenum species from the Pt surface was much lower than that related to the actual electroreduction process (see insert in Fig. 3B). It was only a little greater then that obtained after reversal of the scan direction prior to the onset of peak II, i.e. in the potential range of peak I, at E >0.25V. Obviously, the majority of the reduction products formed in the potential range of peak II move into the solution and the strongly bound surface species in this potential domain are formed only in a parallel side reaction. By taking into account the well known influence of pH on the relative concentration of several molybdenum(VI) species existing in aqueous molybdate solutions [55–60] these data imply the interpretation of cathodic peak II as corresponding to the electroreduction of molybdenum(VI) oxo-species of another nature then those which participate in the electrode process in the potential range of peak I and in a side reaction occurring at E <0.25V. According to the literature data obtained among others in UV–Vis and Raman spectroscopy studies [57–60] the major component in molybdate solutions at pH 1.5–0.4 is the monomeric molybdic acid in the form of trioxo- and dioxo-moieties ( [ Mo VI O 3 ( H 2 O ) 3 ] , [ Mo O 2 VI ( OH ) 2 ( H 2 O ) 2 ] ) being in a rapid equilibrium with oligomeric aggregates, from [ M o 12 VI O 40 ] 8 − and [ H x M o 12 VI O 40 ] ( 8 − x ) − to [ M o 36 VI O 112 ] 8 − and [H x Mo36O112](8−x)−. All these strongly adsorbable species may be involved in the electroreduction process responsible for the cathodic current in the potential range of peak I (0.25<E <0.5V), giving Mo(V) containing surface moieties identified on a Pt electrode by the above presented XPS spectra. Further acidification below pH 0 of the molybdate solutions (c Mo(VI) ≤2.5×10−3 M) favors formation of singly charged protonated mononuclear cations described as [ Mo VI O 2 ( OH ) ( H 2 O ) 3 ] + or HMo O 3 + and some remarkably lower amount of double charged cations [ Mo VI O 2 ( H 2 O ) 4 ] 2 + or H 2 Mo O 3 2 + [57–60]. Because cathodic peak II achieves the highest value on the Pt electrode in the molybdate solution in 4M HClO4, it may be deduced that the concentration of cationic Mo(VI) species, being electroactive at E <0.25V, reaches a maximum at this H+ concentration. An interesting finding is that this is a precondition for the catalytic effect found by us in the electroreduction of unsaturated organic compounds and described below in Section 3.2.2. Irrespective of pH of solution, the Tafel slope obtained in the kinetic range of the current–potential curves (insert in Fig. 3A) at E <0.25V is close to dE/dlog I =60±5mVdecade−1. According to the formal electrochemical kinetics [44,52,54] this implies the second charge transfer as the rate determining step, assuming that in the first step an intermediate adsorbed under Temkin conditions is produced. Thus it is reasonable to suppose that the cathodic peak II corresponds to a successive reduction of the above-mentioned cationic Mo(VI) species to the respective cationic Mo(V) species (such as [ Mo V O ( OH ) 2 ( H 2 O ) 3 ] + or [ Mo V O ( OH ) ( H 2 O ) 4 ] 2 + ) and then to Mo(III) moieties (such as [ Mo III ( OH ) 2 ( H 2 O ) 4 ] + or [ Mo III ( OH ) ( H 2 O ) 5 ] 2 + ), being very stable in solutions at pH<0. This conclusion is justified by a similar value of the half-peak potential of the cathodic peak (II) obtained on Pt in 4M HClO4 solutions containing molybdate and the theoretical value of the standard potential for the Mo(VI)/Mo(III) redox couple, E =0.11V versus SHE [45]. Additionally, the shift of the half peak potential (E p/2) of cathodic peak II to the positive direction with increasing concentration of H+ ions in solution by about E p / 2 / log c H + = 60 mV decade − 1 informs that each electron transfer upon reduction of Mo(VI) to Mo(III) cations is accompanied by an addition of one proton to the reduced species. From the fact that no anodic counterpart to cathodic peak II appears in CVs up to E =1V it follows that both the cationic Mo(V) and the Mo(III) species are not readily reoxidized at the Pt/solution interface. An alternative reduction pathway of Mo(VI) to Mo (IV) as the stable final product seems unlikely because no Mo(IV) species were found among the surface species strongly bound to the electrode surface in the XPS data obtained ex situ and furthermore, there is no indication, so far, of the existence of stable Mo(IV) aqua ions in solution. In view of the above presented results, the sequence of reactions occurring upon electroreduction of monomeric Mo(VI) species at E <0.25V on Pt at high perchloric acid concentration in solution can be tentatively described as (1) [ Mo VI O 2 ( OH ) ( H 2 O ) 3 ] + ⟶ + H + + e − [ Mo V O ( OH ) 2 ( H 2 O ) 3 ] + ⟶ + 2 H + + 2 e − [ Mo III ( OH ) 2 ( H 2 O ) 4 ] + [ Mo VI O 2 ( H 2 O ) 4 ] 2 + ⟶ + H + + e − [ Mo V O ( OH ) ( H 2 O ) 4 ] 2 + ⟶ + 2 H + + 2 e − [ Mo III ( OH ) ( H 2 O ) 5 ] 2 + Kinetic limitations in the second step of this processes are clearly manifested as a decrease in cathodic peak II on stirring of 4M HClO4 solution with c Mo(VI) ≥1×10−3 M. Apparently, some part of the intermediate Mo(V) species move away from the vicinity of Pt electrode into the bulk solution prior to their reduction to Mo(III) moieties. This means that the rate constant of the Mo(V) reduction to Mo(III) must be lower than that of the Mo(V) formation from the parent substrate, Mo(VI). However, the question remains still open about the exact structure of the electroactive substrate and the reduction products. It is not easy to clarify this problem, since as shown in Fig. 4 the shape of the voltammetric response depends not only on the acid concentration but also on the analytical molybdate concentration in solution of pH=const, in parallel to changes in the relative distribution of various Mo(VI) forms at the electrode/solution interface. From the insert in Fig. 4 which presents CVs for various concentrations of Na2MoO4 in 4M HClO4 solution, it follows that both the diffusion-limited plateau current attributed to the reduction of monomeric Mo(VI) cations into the respective Mo(III) cations and the current in the Tafel range of cathodic peak II (at E <0.25) increase linearly with molybdate bulk concentration increasing up to c Mo(VI) =1×10−3 M. This means the reaction order of z Mo(VI) =1 with respect to Mo(VI) in accordance with the reaction schema proposed above. However, at c Mo(VI) =2×10−3 M to 5×10−3 M the cathodic peak II reaches a maximum and then gradually decreases. In parallel, cathodic peak current I attributed to the reduction of adsorbed oligomeric Mo(VI) species to Mo(V) moieties continuously increases. By taking into account the fact that an increase in the total molybdate concentration in acidified solutions promotes condensation of monomeric Mo(VI) cations into dimers, such as [ M o 2 VI O 5 ( OH ) ( H 2 O ) 5 ] + and [ M o 2 VI O 5 ( H 2 O ) 6 ] 2 + [58,59] or H2Mo2O6 + and H3Mo2O6 3+ [60], this result points to a substantial amount of dimeric cations in 4M HClO4 solution when the total Mo(VI) concentration exceeds c Mo(VI) =1×10−3 M. The reduction of such dimeric species connected with their dissociation into monomeric ones on the electrode surface could be responsible for the observed linear increase in the maximum current of peak (I) with the square root of the Mo(VI) concentration ( c Mo ( VI ) 1 / 2 ) at c Mo(VI) >1×10−3 M. This type of relationship between the reaction rate and the reactant concentration has been reported for several heterogeneous processes including dissociative chemisorption of organic reactants [61]. A simultaneous decrease in peak (II) implies that neither Mo(VI) nor Mo(V) dimeric or oligomeric forms undergo reduction at E <0.25V and the only reducible species in this potential range are monomeric Mo(VI) cations. Note, that the wave resulting from the reduction of dimeric Mo(VI) cations appeared at more positive potentials as compared with that due to the reduction of monomeric Mo(VI) species also on Hg in trifluoromethanesulfonic acid solution [62]."
4,Electrochemical behavior of allyl alcohol on a polycrystalline Pt in acidic solutions with and without of Mo(VI),"3.2 Electrochemical behavior of allyl alcohol on a polycrystalline Pt in acidic solutions with and without of Mo(VI) As mentioned in the introduction, the addition of Na2MoO4 to the concentrated HClO4 solution resulted in enhancement of the cathodic current corresponding to the reduction of AA on a polycrystalline Pt electrode. In order to obtain information on the mechanism of this effect we investigated the kinetics of electroreduction of AA alone and in the presence of Mo(VI) in solution, upon cyclic voltammetry conditions at various scan rates and after holding the electrode potential at a constant E ad value for various AA (5×10−5–1×10−1 M), Mo(VI) (1×10−4–1×10−1 M) and acid concentrations (1–4M). The results obtained are described below. 3.2.1 Electroreduction of allyl alcohol on Pt Exemplary CVs of AA on the polycrystalline Pt electrode in acidic solutions are presented in Fig. 5A for several scan rates at a constant AA concentration and in Fig. 5B for different AA concentrations at a constant scan rate. The irreversible electroreduction of AA at E <0.25V is manifested during the negative going sweep by a well developed cathodic peak with a maximum between E ≈0.12V and E ≈0.07V at the AA concentration 1×10−4 M and 5×10−1 M, respectively. There is no doubt that a relatively fast adsorption of the reactant dissolved in the supporting electrolyte solution is involved in the initial step of this process. The electrode coverage with the adsorbed AA species is clearly evidenced in Fig. 5A by a suppression of the current related to the hydrogen adsorption–desorption at E <0.4V on a bare Pt surface in a supporting electrolyte solution and by the appearance of an anodic peak corresponding to the oxidation of the surface moieties within the potential range 0.8–1.6V, in the presence of the (OH)ad/Oad species on the Pt surface. This points to a higher rate of the AA adsorption compared to that of its reductive desorption. Additionally, the independence of the cathodic current reflecting the AA electroreduction at the foot of the of the CV signals on the solution composition for c AA ≥1×10−3 M (see Fig. 5B) reveals that the electrode coverage with the reactant attains the limiting value under such conditions, which means the reaction order equal to zero with respect to AA. Accordingly, the I–E dependencies at the electrode potentials positive to the peak maximum were not influenced by the scan rate. However, the rate of AA consumption due to electroreduction at the potential of the peak maximum exceeded that of the mass transport from the bulk solution to the electrode surface up to v <0.04Vs−1 as proved in the insert in Fig. 5A by the linear plot of the peak current (I p) versus square root of the scan rate (v) according to the Randles–Ševčik equation for diffusion controlled electrode processes [50–53]. This conclusion is supported by the presence of the cathodic current on scanning the potential in the positive direction. Consequently, stirring of the solution with argon results in the appearance of a cathodic wave with a distinct limiting current in the potential range negative to the potential at which the much lower peak current was obtained under stationary conditions. In the insert in Fig. 5B one can see that both for the stationary and stirred AA solutions there is a linear relation between the peak current and the substrate concentration (from 1×10−4 M to 1×10−1 M) at v <0.04Vs−1. Thus, the Pt electrode might be used for quantitative determination of AA content in solution in the above-mentioned concentration range, albeit the CV signal for the lower concentration limit is very small. On increase in the sweep rate above 0.04Vs−1 and in consequence of the mass transport, the overall reduction rate at the potential of the peak maximum appears to be determined by the kinetics of adsorption of the substrate and/or one of the steps included in the successive hydrogenation of AA species. This is reflected in a negative deviation from the linear I p − v 1 / 2 dependence depicted in the insert in Fig. 5A. A successive decrease in the amount of AA species adsorbed on the electrode surface is well visible in CVs by an increase in the current related to the oxidative desorption of hydrogen from the electrode surface. Finally, at a sufficiently high scan rates the re-adsorption of AA can be almost avoided, as also observed on the platinized Pt electrode in 1M H2SO4 [63]. We have found that the electrode coverage with the adsorbate formed in 5×10−4 M AA solution becomes negligibly small at v ≈ 0.5 V s − 1 but v ≈ 5 V s − 1 must be used when the AA concentration in the investigated solution is equal to 5×10−3 M. Thus it is almost certain that the reduction of AA on the investigated polycrystalline Pt electrode, similarly as on a Pt/PTFE electrode [36], obeys a CE mechanism in which the non-electrochemical step, chemisorption of AA molecules, precedes the reductive charge transfer at the electrode/solution interface connected with the addition of hydrogen to the surface species. As shown in Fig. 6 , the half peak potential of the AA electroreduction is shifted in the positive direction with increasing concentration of H+ ions in solution by about E p / 2 / log c H + = 0.06 ± 0.005 V decade − 1 . It is clear that each electron transfer in this process is accompanied by an addition of one proton to the reduced AA species. This result is in agreement with those of previous DEMS and FTIR studies on a porous Pt electrode [36], which detected propane as the main product of electroreduction of bulk AA. The Tafel slope of dE/dlog I =0.050±0.005Vdecade−1, independent of the concentration of the supporting electrolyte between 1M and 4M HClO4 (see insert in Fig. 6), points to the second heterogeneous hydrogenation step to be rate determining in the overall reaction pathway occurring in the Tafel potential range. On the other hand, detection of some amount of propene during the AA reduction on a porous Pt electrode [36] might suggests that the hydrogenation of AA to propene: (2) CH2 CHCH2OH+2H+ +2e− →CH2 CHCH3 +H2O occurs somewhat faster than the following hydrogenation of propene to propane: (3) CH2 CHCH3 +2H+ +2e− →CH3CH2CH3 The reason for some differences in the kinetics of individual hydrogen addition steps upon electroreduction of AA to propane on a polycrystalline and porous Pt electrodes may be the different surface structure of these two types of electrodes. Influence of the electrode potential on the amount and nature of the species present on the surface of the polycrystalline Pt electrode after adsorption of AA at a constant potential E ad (in the range 0.07–0.8V) for a constant time t ad is illustrated in the representative CVs in Fig. 7 obtained during the first positive or the first negative going sweep after replacement of the reactant-containing electrolyte with a pure supporting electrolyte. Having analyzed the electrode coverage with strongly bonded AA species and the charge corresponding to the direct complete adsorbate oxidation to CO2, which was identified as the sole oxidation product of all the adsorbed organic species [36,38,39,64–67], we have established the highest and almost constant number of electrons transferred per one Pt site (n eps ≈5) at E ad between 0.25V and 0.4V, positive enough to prevent any reductive desorption of AA. A broad anodic signal visible in Fig. 7A during the first positive going scan at E >0.8V (with a maximum around 1.05V) after AA adsorption in the above-mentioned potential range (0.25–0.4V) proves the co-existence of several surface species. Similar behavior was earlier ascertained using DEMS and FTIR on a porous Pt not only for AA [36] but also for alkyne and alkene [38,39,64] as well as for aliphatic alcohols and diols [65–67]. By taking into account that ca. 5 electrons are transferred per each Pt site of our electrodes upon the direct oxidative desorption of the AA surface species formed in the considered potential range, it is reasonable to suppose that the ad-layer consists predominantly of the associatively bonded reactant molecules along with partially dehydrogenated AA species C3H y OH with y ≤3 (such as or ) due to abstraction of vinyl hydrogen atoms and the hydrocarbon-type residues C3H y with y ≤3 (such as or ). Since the C3 hydrocarbons were detected as the main product of hydrogenation of AA [36] it is obvious that the C3-carbon skeleton remains preserved in a large majority of the surface species. Therefore it can be concluded that the AA species adsorbs predominantly with the double CC bond arranged almost parallel toward the electrode surface whereas the interaction of the π and di-σ orbitals of AA with Pt having half-filled orbitals facilitates splitting and formation of CH bonds as well as rupture of the CO bond. Such type of coordination to Pt surface sites was earlier reported among others for etene [64], propene [38], ethyne [39] and propanol-2 [65] adsorbates. At E ad above 0.5V, as generally found for all these organic compounds, one can see in CVs in Fig. 7B a decreased Pt coverage with strongly bound species and the charge involved in their oxidation to CO2. Because in parallel the n eps values gradually decrease, this means that an increasing amount of the C3-adsorbate must be in a higher oxidation state than that present in the potential range 0.25–0.4V. The absence of methane in the DEMS experiments constitute an indirect proof that formation of diol related residues can be ruled out [66,67]. Thus, it is almost certain that progressively stronger interaction between the organic species and Pt, along with the shift of the electrode potential in the positive direction, results in an increase in the dehydrogenation degree of the AA surface species. Additionally, the coexistence of various species differently bound to the Pt surface was corroborated by CVs obtained during the first negative sweep after adsorption at E ad ≥0.25 and electrolyte exchange. As follows from Fig. 7C, the majority of the organic adsorbate which was formed under such conditions undergoes an almost complete hydrogenation to molecular hydrocarbon at the electrode potentials below 0.25V and desorbs from the Pt surface. Consequently, one can state a recovery of the hydrogen adsorption–desorption. Furthermore, the current related to the oxidation of the remaining residues during the succeeding positive sweep is clearly decreased in comparison to that observed upon the direct positive sweep starting from E ad (Fig. 7A). One part of the cathodically non-desorbable species gets oxidized in the potential range 0.6–0.9V, typical of the electrooxidation of adsorbed CO/CHO-like species [36,38,39,64], while the rest can be removed from the Pt surface at higher electrode potentials (E >0.9V) characteristic of the electrooxidation of hydrocarbon-type moieties (C x H y , x ≤3) [38,39,64]. Interestingly, exclusively the CO/CHO-like species existed in the ad-layer present on Pt when the electrode potential was held at E ad ≤0.12V. During the direct positive going sweep it was manifested as a well developed anodic peak corresponding to generation of CO2 at around 0.75V (Fig. 7D) whereas ca. 2.5 electrons were transferred per Pt site (n eps ≈2.5). This can be seen as indicative that the carbon backbone of some AA species upon adsorption on the electrode surface partially covered with hydrogen ad-atoms undergoes dissociative decomposition while the majority of AA is reduced to propane. Most probably the limited number of free Pt sites enable a part of AA molecules to get adsorbed via the oxygen atom of the alcohol group, with the carbon chain in perpendicular position toward the Pt surface. It is well known that such an adsorbate orientation favors cleavage of the OH bond in the alcohol group and of at least one of the CH bonds at αC, which is accompanied by dissociation of the neighboring CC bond according to the equations: (4) C3H5OH→COad +(C2H3)ad +3H+ +3e− (5) C3H5OH→CHOad +(C2H3)ad +2H+ +2e− While the adsorbed CO/COH-like residues remain strongly bound on the Pt surface, the C2-hydrocarbon residues may easily undergo hydrogenation to ethane which was confirmed with DEMS on a porous Pt electrode [36]. A continuous change in the composition of the ad-layer with a shift of E ad from 0.1V toward 0.25V is clearly demonstrated by changes in the shape of the CV response obtained during the direct oxidation of the adsorbate to CO2. As shown in Fig. 7E, the electro-oxidation of strongly bound species after AA adsorption at E ad =0.15V generates two current peaks with the maxima at E ≈0.75V typical for CO/CHO residues [36,38,39,64] and at E ≈0.85V which might suggest the presence of organic residues with carbonyl group, detected earlier with FTIR [36]. The amount of CO-like adsorbate decreases with the shift of the electrode potential in the positive direction (Fig. 7F) and finally, from a comparison of CVs in Fig. 7D–F with those in Fig. 7A and B it is clear that neither adsorbed CO nor the carbonyl group containing species are formed on setting E ad ≥0.25V. 3.2.2 Electroreduction of allyl alcohol on a Pt/Mo(VI) electrode An appreciable rise in the rate of AA reduction on a polycrystalline Pt electrode was discovered in the presence of cationic Mo(VI) species in concentrated perchloric acid solutions. It is evident when one compares CVs obtained after the addition of sodium molybdate to 4M HClO4 solution containing AA with that characteristic of AA in a pure supporting electrolyte. Fig. 8A exemplify the influence of increasing Mo(VI) concentration on the wave-shaped cathodic peak corresponding to the AA reduction at E <0.25V, having an inflection point around E ≈0.7–0.9V. One can see that the cathodic peak current obtained in solution containing AA at a concentration c AA ≤2×10−4 M in the presence of 2×10−3 M Mo(VI) is about two orders of magnitude higher in comparison with that observed for AA alone. At increased AA concentration (e.g. c AA =1×10−3 M) and the same amount of Mo(VI) the AA reduction occurs about 17 times faster then in the absence of Mo(VI). Moreover, for the solutions containing a constant molybdate concentration in 4M HClO4 we have found that the rate of electroreduction of Mo(VI) species on a polycrystalline Pt electrode is greatly increased on the addition of AA as compared with that in the absence of AA – see Fig. 8B. This phenomenon enable a detection of remarkably lower amounts of AA in bulk solution than in the absence of Mo(VI) and also a detection of substantially lower amounts of Mo(VI) in bulk solution than in the absence of AA. It should be emphasized that the presence of Mo(VI) in acidic solution was indispensable for the catalytic effect in reduction of AA on a Pt electrode. No increase in the reaction rate was observed in CVs when the Pt electrode modified with the electrochemically deposited mixed-valent Mo(VI)/Mo(V) oxide layer was transferred into the AA solution in 4M HClO4 not containing Na2MoO4. From comparison of CVs in Fig. 8 and in Fig. 3 it follows that the enhanced reduction rate of AA is observed in the potential range which almost coincides with that of the reduction the monomeric cationic Mo(VI) species to the respective cationic Mo(V) and subsequently to Mo(III) species (peak current II at E <0.25V) in solutions without AA. Accordingly, the extent of catalysis strongly depends on the proton concentration, albeit pH has no influence on the magnitude of the peak current corresponding to the electroreduction of AA alone (see Fig. 6). As shown in Fig. 9 , the catalytic properties of the Pt/Mo(VI) electrode toward AA reduction achieve the highest level when using 4M HClO4 as a supporting electrolyte. However, further increase in the acid concentration has practically no effect on the kinetics of the process investigated. Therefore, the 4M HClO4 solution was specified as the optimum electrolyte for catalytic reduction of AA in the presence of Mo(VI). At this H+ concentration, as mentioned above in Section 3.1, the amount of cationic Mo(VI) species in solution and consequently the peak current II, corresponding to the electroreduction of these species alone, achieve a maximum, in agreement with the results of UV–Vis and Raman spectroscopic studies [57–60]. Hence it is obvious, that the magnitude of the catalytic reduction current observed in the AA–Mo(VI) system (Figs. 8 and 9) strongly depends on an amount of cationic Mo(VI) species in the bulk solution. However, the Tafel slope equal to dE/dlog I =0.060±0.005Vdecade−1 is independent of the concentration of the supporting electrolyte in the range 1–4M (insert A in Fig. 9), thus suggesting that the mechanism of the AA reduction from the acidified molybdate solution does not change with changes in pH. The Tafel slope value suggests that the second step of AA hydrogenation determines the overall reaction rate, just as in the absence of molybdenum (Section 3.2.1). Accordingly, it follows from the insert B in Fig. 9 that the reaction order with respect to H+ is equal to one. By taking into account the results described above, the observed catalytic effect both in the AA and Mo(VI) reduction can be explained by the cyclic regeneration of the electroactive molybdenum species in a fast non faradaic reaction between AA coming to the electrode from bulk solutions and the Mo(III) and/or Mo(V) cationic species formed at the Pt/solution interface in the consecutive charge transfer steps from the cationic Mo(VI) species. The appearance of cathodic current in CVs after reversal of the scan direction into the anodic once, visible in Figs. 8 and 9, supports this conclusion. Additionally, it was verified by the fact that the observed catalytic peak current was almost independent of the scan rate up to v ≈0.1Vs−1, which was predicted by the theory developed for the irreversible catalytic chemical reaction coupled to the preceding irreversible charge transfer [50,51,68], although a relatively slow electroreduction of the preadsorbed AA occurs in an almost the same potential range. According to this theory the limiting catalytic current may be described by the equation: I p = n F k 1 / 2 c Ox D Ox 1 / 2 c Z 1 / 2 , where k is the rate constant of the catalytic chemical reaction, c Z is the concentration of the substance undergoing reduction in the non-faradaic reaction with the reduced form of the electroactive catalyst of the concentration c Ox. As shown in Fig. 10A, we have found that the catalytic current under conditions of a constant amount of AA (c AA =1×10−5–5×10−3 M) in 4M HClO4 solution increases linearly with increasing Mo(VI) concentration above c Mo(VI) =5×10−5 M and for each AA concentration attains a maximum value at c Mo(VI) =1×10−3–2×10−3 M. It is obvious, that this Mo(VI) concentration is optimal for analytical application. Furthermore, the addition of AA to the analyzed solution results in a higher precision of detection of Mo(VI). Considering the experimental data collected in Fig. 10B, one can state that at a constant amount of Mo(VI) in solution there is initially a linear relationship between the catalytic peak current and the square root of AA concentration, but the rate of the reduction process approaches slowly the limiting value at c AA >5×10−4 M. All these dependencies of the catalytic wave-shaped peak current (I p) on c Mo(VI) and c AA justify the assumption that the catalytic reduction process investigated involves formation of an associative adduct between the molybdenum species and AA, whereas the rate of the non-faradaic electron transfer from the conduction band of Mo(III) and or Mo(V) species to AA along with the reductive cleavage of its CO bond and the addition of hydrogen to the organic molecule are most probably decisive for the overall reaction rate. Such associative complex is likely to be formed due to interaction of π-electrons of the double bond of AA with unoccupied ds orbitals of molybdenum cations. The question is still open if AA forms such a complex with the reduced Mo(III) and/or Mo(V) species only or also with the parent Mo(VI) cations, prior to the first charge transfer step. It is reasonable to expect that the presence of hydrogen in the structure of Mo(V) and Mo(III) species facilitates the hydrogenation of AA to propene and next to propane which was identified by using DEMS on a porous Pt electrode [36,38]. However, the exact structure of molybdenum species taking part in the catalytic reduction of AA is unknown at present. Therefore, the reaction sequence accounting for the enhancement of the reduction current in the AA–Mo(VI) system investigated is proposed below for one of the possible protonated forms of the cationic molybdenum species (see Section 3.1): (6) (7) The first pathway (6) involves the cationic Mo(III) species, which in the reaction with AA, giving propene, are reoxidized to Mo(V) species. The other possibility (pathway 7) is formation of propene from AA accompanied by a continuous regeneration of the parent Mo(VI) species from Mo(V) species. Analogous mechanism is believed to be responsible for the catalytic effect in the further hydrogenation of propene to propane, since a similar kinetic regularities of Mo(VI) has been detected upon reduction of alkenes in the presence of Mo(VI). The appropriate results will be reported elsewhere. Keeping in mind that various Mo(VI), Mo(V) and Mo(III) species may exists in solution, it cannot be excluded that all of them are involved in the catalysis. It should be noted that the side reaction consisting in the reductive decomposition of AA and formation of adsorbed C1-oxygen-containing residues, partially blocking the Pt surface for the main reaction, does not occur in the presence of Mo(VI) in the vicinity of the Pt electrode. The current signal corresponding to the oxidation of CO-like species, which is present in CVs after the AA adsorption at E ad =0.1V from the electrolyte solution containing this alcohol alone (see Fig. 7D), disappears completely when the same experiment is made after the addition of molybdate to the electrolyte solution used in the system investigated. During the direct anodic sweep one can find solely a small peak current attributed to the oxidative stripping of Mo(V/VI) surface species, with a maximum at about 0.5V. This result suggests that the C3-carbon skeleton remains intact under such conditions and all AA species get reduced to propene and next to propane. There are two possible reasons for such behavior: (1) the strong coordination of the alcohol CH2OH group in the complex with molybdenum species prevents its interaction with the Pt surface and thus the rupture of the carbon skeleton of AA at αC atom and (2) due to an electronic effect of adsorbed Mo(V/VI) species, the Pt electrode surface reveals no affinity to CO. Further mechanistic information can be expected from studies with in situ spectroelectrochemical techniques."
5,Conclusions,"Efficient catalysis of AA reduction on a polycrystalline Pt electrode in 4M HClO4 solution containing Mo(VI) oxo-species was demonstrated. Simultaneously, the rate of electroreduction of Mo(VI) species was found to be effectively increased in the presence of AA. A considerable enhancement of the reaction rate was achieved in the potential range of the wave-shaped peak current II corresponding to the electroreduction of monomeric cationic Mo(VI) species to the appropriate Mo(V) and Mo(III) species in the absence of AA. The cathodic wave-shaped peak current obtained in the AA–Mo(VI) system was by about 1–2 orders of magnitude greater then that of AA or Mo(VI) alone. Examination of the experimentally established dependencies of the cathodic peak current at E <0.25V on the AA and Mo(VI) concentration in the electrolyte solution lead to the conclusion, that the observed catalytic effect results from the cyclic regeneration of the electroactive molybdenum species via a chemical reduction of AA in reaction with Mo(III) and/or Mo(V) moieties produced in the preceding reductive charge transfer step. The behavior of Mo(VI) and of AA alone at a Pt electrode in acidic solutions under the same experimental conditions was presented for the sake of comparison. It was shown that each electron transfer upon successive reduction of Mo(VI) cations to the Mo(V) and Mo(III) cations was accompanied by the addition of protons to their structure, which consequently facilitated hydrogenation of AA. An important finding was that CO-like species do not arise as a side-product of the reductive AA hydrogenation in the electrolyte solution containing Mo(VI) cations. Thus, in this way poisoning of the Pt surface can be eliminated. It should be emphasized that the Pt electrode in a strongly concentrated perchloric acid solutions appears to be attractive for practical application in monitoring of AA in the presence of Mo(VI) and/or of Mo(VI) in the presence of AA. The obtained results specify optimal conditions for electrochemical detection of these compounds."
