0,Introduction,"To satisfy the burgeon energy requirements and reduce serious environmental pollution, semiconductors photocatalysis has been widely studied in academic community and industry since the discovery of the Fujishima and Honda effect in 1972. 1–3 This technology help human beings realize their urgent desire, such as water splitting, 4–11 pollutant degradation, 12–17 CO2 reduction, 18–25 and selective synthesis of organic compounds. 26–29 Nevertheless, (I) poor visible light absorption, (II) low separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, (III) unsatisfactory quantum efficiency, and (IV) unexceptional stability remain the main hurdles of semiconductor photocatalytic technology for practical application, especially for hydrogen production from water splitting. 2 Fortunately, researchers had come up with several strategies to overcome these hurdles, such as doping engineering, noble metal deposition and semiconductors combination. Among numerous photocatalysts, Bi-based photocatalysts, Bi2WO6, Bi2MoO6, Bi4Ti3O12 (three simplest Aurivillius family perovskites), and anther special meltimetal oxide BiVO4, have been widely researched due to their ideal compositions, structures and properties. Nevertheless, some shortcomings of ABO3 formulated perovskite hinder its effective use as water splitting photocatalysts. Herein, we summarize the modification strategies to efficiently improve the activity of Bi-based perovskite oxide photocatalysts for water splitting to H2. Moreover, we deeply illustrate and analyze the relationship between the morphological, photophysical and photochemical properties of Bi-based perovskite oxide photocatalysts, namely focus on, morphological control, dopant or defect structures and semiconductor combination. These aspects reflect the research status of Bi-based perovskite oxide photocatalysts, and their great potential in the field of clean energy production. The schematic diagram of three main modulation strategies about four Bi-based multimetal oxides is shown in Fig. 1 ."
1,Different types of Bi-based multimetal oxides,
2,Bismuth tungstate,"2.1 Bismuth tungstate Bismuth tungstate (Bi2WO6) has been widely researched due to its satisfactory compositions, structures and properties. 31–35 It is generally fabricated by using Bi(NO3)3 and Na2WO4. Bi2WO6 consists of [Bi2O2] and perovskite-type layers, possessing relatively narrow band gap of 2.6–2.9 ​eV. 30 , 36 And the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) of Bi2WO6 consist of O 2p and Bi 6s orbitals, W 5d and O 2p orbitals, respectively. 30 , 37 The layered configuration can satisfactorily promote electron conductivity and determine visible light absorption. Hence, the photocatalytic activity of Bi2WO6 can be maximized over a large range due to its tunable physical and electronic properties. It has been used in a variety of photocatalytic applications because of its low cost, nontoxicity, and excellent thermal and chemical stability. 3–28 Recently, zero dimension Bi2WO6 quantum dots and one dimension Bi2WO6 nanofibers have attracted wide research attention. Also, Bi2WO6 nanofibers exhibit broad prospects with the development of electrospinning technology, especially the coaxial electrospinning. 38"
3,Bismuth molybdate,"2.2 Bismuth molybdate Bismuth molybdate (Bi2MoO6) is a member of aurivillius oxide perovskite, in which [Bi2O2]2+ layers are surrounded the corner-sharing structure of MoO6 octahedra, leading to a relatively narrow band gap of 2.5–2.8 ​eV Bi2MoO6 are generally formed with Bi2O3·nMoO3 (n ​= ​3, 2, 1), namely α-Bi2Mo3O12, β-Bi2Mo2O9 and γ-Bi2MoO6, 39 , 40 among which γ-Bi2MoO6 has become a hot spot in photocatalytic field due to its best photocatalytic performance. In addition, the visible light response edge of Bi2MoO6 can be extended to ca. 500 ​nm. 41 , 42 Its conduction band (CB) is composed of Mo 4p and Bi 6p orbitals, and the valence band (VB) made up of O 2p orbitals. 43 In spite of its merits, few attention was paid on employing Bi2MoO6 in hydrogen production by water splitting. Zhang et al. prepared porous nanoflake BiMO x (M ​= ​W, V, and Mo) photoanodes via a hydrothermal anion exchange method. 44 Note that Bi2MoO6 was formed by replacing WO4 2− in bismuth tungstate with MoO4 2−. They introduced porous nanoflake Bi2MoO6 in water splitting as photocatalyst and obtained a result of 120 ​μA ​cm−2, which was almost the highest in all reported results of Bi2MoO6. Therefore, there are still quantities of efforts need to be made for water splitting with Bi2MoO6 as photocatalyst."
4,Bismuth vanadate,"2.3 Bismuth vanadate Thanks to its low cost, non-toxicity, simple synthesis approach, good stability, narrow band gap, favorable visible light response and other advantages, Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) has been considered to be the best Bi-based photocatalyst for water splitting to H2, especially in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. 45–48 BiVO4 possesses three main crystal phases: tetragonal scheelite, monoclinic scheelite and tetragonal zircon, in which monoclinic scheelite is considered to be the excellent photocatalyst due to its appropriate band gap of 2.4 ​eV. 49 The CB of BiVO4 is composed of Bi 6p, V 3d, O 2p orbitals, and the VB of BiVO4 is composed of Bi 6s, O 2s orbitals. The CB of BiVO4 (approximately 0.3 ​V vs. NHE) is higher than the hydrogen reduction potential. Notably, the advanced works of morphological control and combining with other semiconductors can highly enhance its hydrogen production rate. No matter the direct or indirect band gap, BiVO4 is an suitable candidate of the hydrogen production during water splitting. 50 , 51 Under the condition of BiVO4-based photocatalysts’ assistance, the hydrogen production rate can reach thousand even tens of thousands μmol h−1 g−1."
5,Bismuth titanate,"2.4 Bismuth titanate Titanate-based photocatalysts has been reported frequently in recent years because of its abundance and environment friendlyness. 52–54 Bismuth titanate (Bi4Ti3O12), a member of aurivillius phase perovskite oxide, possesses a wide band gap of approximately 2.9–3.0 ​eV. The Bi4Ti3O12 has alternating layers of (Bi2O2)2+ and (Bi2Ti3O10)2−, existing in the form of orthorhombic crystal system. 53 , 55 , 56 However, the separation of photogenerated carriers of pure Bi4Ti3O12 could not be conducted successfully, resulting in poor performance of pure Bi4Ti3O12 for hydrogen evolution. 54 Obviously, great efforts should be paid on efficiently inhibiting the recombination of photoinduced electrons and holes. Modification of Bi4Ti3O12 is vital. For example, coupling with silver-based semiconductors not only retain the wide band gap of Bi4Ti3O12, but also promote the transfer of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. 57 Fig. 2 a–d shows the crystal structures of four Bi-based multimetal oxides. 36 , 58–60"
6,Modulation strategies of Bi-based multimetal oxides,
7,Morphological control,"3.1 Morphological control The size and morphology determine the performance of the catalyst to a certain extent. Changing the morphology of the catalytic materials can alter the exposure of the active site, affecting reactivity. It is universally understood that large specific surface area with increased exposure of active sites and appropriate band gap with enhanced visible light absorption would contribute to the reactivity. Bi-based nanocrystals fabricated by different methods show different structures, particle sizes, morphologies and other properties, and they have their own advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, to overcome the drawbacks observed in Bi-based particles, it is necessary to further study the synthesis process to explore new morphologies. Nowadays, researches of morphology become a new hotspot in many fields, such as zero dimension (0D) quantum dots, one dimension (1D) nanofibers, two dimension (2D) ultrathin/monolayer nanosheets/plates, three dimension (3D) hierarchical and hollow nanostructures. Note that the combination of above morphologies possesses broad prospects. 3.1.1 0D nanostructures Zero-dimensional quantum dots (QDs), approximately 1–10 ​nm, have been deeply studied due to a high light absorption and excellent optical stability. The large intrinsic dipole moments in QD material can suppress the recombination of photogenerated carriers. 61–63 Bi2WO6 is one of the most commonly studied quantum dots over the last decade. Li et al. 64 prepared Bi2WO6 QDs by a hydrothermal method and found that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)/Bi2WO6 QD hybrids showed an enhanced PEC performance at high photocurrent densities, good electron transport properties, long electrons lifetime and increased carriers densities. Although Bi2WO6 QDs exhibit the characteristics of random agglomeration, it can be uniformly dispersed on the surface of BN nanosheets with a size range of 5–8 ​nm. Notably, there are few reports about 0D Bi-based quantum dots, further research work on low dimensional nanomaterials should be done urgently. 3.1.2 1D nanostructures With relatively short quantum diffusion length, easy relaxation on flexible substrates and separation from aqueous suspensions through only sedimentation, the use of 1D nanostructures in photocatalysis have been extensively studied for approximately ten years. 65 , 66 There are diverse approaches for synthesizing one-dimensional Bi-based materials, exemplified by electrospinning, 67 , 68 solvothermal method, 69 and hydrothermal method. 70 Bi-based nanofibers prepared by electrospinning are scarcely reported in application of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Normally, electrospinning nanofibers are prepared with the assistance of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) or polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP). For example, Zhao et al. synthesized Bi2WO6 microbelts via simple electrospinning processes. 67 The PVP/Bi2WO6 composite microbelts with 1D textured structures were oriented in a random manner, with width of 3–4 ​μm and lengths of approximately tens of micrometers. After high-temperature (500 ​°C) calcination and PVP removal, a clear belt texture, namely the 1D structure could be still retained, while the width of the belts substantially decreased to about 1.5 ​μm. This demonstrated the 1D microbelts were composed of Bi2WO6 nanoplates. Fig. 3 a–d clearly illustrate the morphological changes of the one-dimensional structure in this process. Therefore, the as-prepared Bi2WO6 microbelts possessed large specific surface areas and narrow band gap. The specific surface areas of the Bi2WO6 microbelts reached 14.8 ​m2 ​g−1. In addition, Zhang et al. prepared PAN/Bi2MoO6 hybrid nanofibers through a two-step synthetic routes (solvothermal and heat treating processes). 71 These 1D nanofibers prepared by electrospinning showed higher photocatalytic performances than other processes. The activity of Rhodamine B degradation reached 90%. Moreover, there is great potential of 1D Bi-based nanofiber materials to be used in hydrogen production due to their extensive visible light response and low-dimension beneficial for the effective separation of carriers. Despite the great progress in the design of 1D Bi-based perovskite oxide nanofibers, a practical method is still urgently required considering the economic effectiveness. In addition, spatially ordered 1D Bi-based perovskite oxide architectures can narrow the disparity between the nanoscale and micro- or macroscale. Regarding the preparation of 1D Bi-based perovskite oxide nanofibers, the electrospinning, especially the coaxial electrospinning, is broadly applicable. 3.1.3 2D nanostructures 2D nanomaterials have been intensively studied thanks to their large specific surface areas, the enhanced separation ability of photoinduced carriers and the improved visible light absorption capacity. 72 , 73 Compared with powder materials, ultrathin 2D materials have aroused widespread interest because 2D monolayer materials can form a thin heterojunction interface superior to conventional ones. The thickness of the monolayer samples is several nanometers, and the length is 200–400 ​nm. Traditional Bi2WO6 can be modified to form a 2D monolayer by a CTAB-assisted hydrothermal method. 19 , 36 , 74 Hu et al. synthesized a monolayer Bi2WO6 sandwich structure using the CTAB-assisted hydrothermal method and decorated it on black phosphorus (BP) nanoflakes to form a heterostructure. 74 Similarly, Zhou’s group successfully synthesized a freestanding monolayer of Bi2WO6 by the same method. 36 All of them possessed excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution performances (4208 and 2667 ​μmol ​h−1 ​g−1, respectively). The structure of pristine monolayer Bi2WO6 is shown in Fig. 4 a. The bandgap energy of the monolayer was approximately 2.7 ​eV, 0.2 ​eV lower than that of the traditional nanocrystal Bi2WO6. In addition, the composition of the top of the VB and the bottom of the CB was different, whether the monolayer Bi2WO6 is modified by Br ion or not. The formation mechanism and the morphology of monolayer Bi2WO6 with Br ions and CTAB assistance can be seen in Fig. 4b–e. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the Bi2WO6 monolayers is shown in Fig. 4f–i. This result indicated that the Br ions were nonstoichiometrically coordinated with the [BiO]+ layers and CTA+, further illustrating the superiority of 2D monolayer Bi2WO6 over conventional nanocrystal Bi2WO6. Significantly, under the sensitization of Rhodamine B and the assistance of cocatalyst Pt (3 ​wt%), the activity of hydrogen evolution got highly increased. Additionally, 2D reduced graphene oxide (rGO) like rGO-BiVO4 often utilized to modify Bi-based materials for H2 evolution and pollutants removal due to the large specific areas and outstanding electric conductivity. 75 In another report, 2D BP/BiVO4 composite materials exhibits an excellent photocatalytic performance in hydrogen evolution, 76 which will be introduced below in detail. Although the research on 2D Bi2WO6 nanomaterials has made remarkable achievements over the past few years, there are promising explorations on synthesizing 2D nanosheet plates with uniform thicknesses. Moreover, ultrathin monolayer materials are prone to agglomeration, reducing the surface active sites. Hence, various strategies have been utilized to enhance the stability of 2D nanostructures. In addition, the preparation of atomic-scale Bi2WO6 structures with a manageable number of plies may have broad prospects. 3.1.4 3D nanostructures 3D nanostructures are generally assembled with low-dimensional structural materials. 77–83 3D hierarchical nanostructures or microstructures can not only overcome the issue of acute agglomeration in low-dimensional materials but also possess the properties of both nanoscale materials. The photocatalysts with 3D hierarchical nanostructures or microstructures feature an abundance of surface active sites and high light absorption. 84 Benefiting from large specific surface areas, Bi-based perovskite oxides with 3D hierarchical nanostructures or microstructures generally show strong adsorption on substrates. In addition, hollow structures (including low-dimensional structures) can greatly facilitate mass transfer and efficiently utilize visible light. 85 Recently, Fu et al. successfully prepared 3D Bi2MoO6, and it was further combined with 2D Bi2O3 to enhance the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity via a solvothermal treatment. 86 Fig. 5 a gives the nanostructure and schematic illustration depicting the formation mechanism of Bi2O3/Bi2MoO6 composite materials. Notably, they tuned the ratio of Bi2O3 and Bi2MoO6 by controlling the amount of NaOH. The pristine Bi2MoO6 and the composite samples all exhibited hierarchical micro structures (Fig. 5b–g). Although the visible light absorption ability was relatively low, the hydrogen evolution rate could reach 12.97 ​μmol ​h−1 ​g−1. This can be attributed to the synergistic effects between 2D ultrathin nanostructures and 3D hierarchical nanostructures. Apart from some conventional 3D shapes such as flowers, there are navel-like, 87 grape-like, 88 and core-shell shapes 89 as well. For example, Chen et al. prepared 3D navel-like Bi2WO6 hierarchical microspheres. 87 The navel-like hierarchical structures could maintain their integrity. The specific surface area was approximately 35.40 ​m2 ​g−1. The small mesopores might be produced during the crystal growth, while the large macropores might be caused by the gap between Bi2WO6 nanosheets. Lu et al. prepared novel magnetic Fe3O4@SiO2@Bi2WO6/CeO2 (FSBC) hierarchical microspheres with a grape-like morphology with a diameter of approximately 1.0 ​μm. 88 The FSBC sample showed excellent photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, magnetic composites could be used in the synthesis of various multifunctional mixtures with increased photoelectric performance and magnetic ability. Meng et al. synthesized plasmonic and magnetically separable Ag/AgCl–Bi2WO6@Fe3O4@SiO2 core-shell composites, which were used in visible-light-induced water detoxification. 89 In this work, Ag/AgCl QDs were loaded on the particle surface to form Ag/AgCl-(M) Bi2WO6. These novel 3D nanomaterials can be well used for photocatalytic H2 evolution, possessing great prospects in water splitting. In addition, Pan et al. designed 3D brochosomes-like TiO2/WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction materials and applied them in PEC hydrogen evolution. 90 The samples possess regular and dense hollow porous morphologies (see Fig. 5h-m), and exhibit a high activity of PEC hydrogen production due to their low EIS and high photocurrent density (PC), resulting in an enhanced performance. In summary, the nano/microstructures of Bi-based perovskite oxides greatly affect their properties. While the synthetic factors affect the structures of 3D materials, but they are not the primary reasons. Significantly, scholars should conduct follow-up research in this field, such as conducting electron spin resonance (ESR) and thermogravimetric analysis to detect defects and study the chemical stability, and exploring some deep theoretical calculations to understand some deep-level attributes. Furthermore, some economic factors should be also considered. Overall, there is still a long time before achieving a large-scale, economically viable production of Bi-based perovskite oxides."
8,Semiconductor combination,"3.2 Semiconductor combination Semiconductor-based heterojunctions can promote rapid charge separation, which become a significant strategy for the efficient utilization of solar energy. Moreover, the heterostructure formation of semiconductor composites can also extend the wavelength of photoresponse. 91 , 92 Generally, semiconductor architectures can be roughly divided into three categories according to band structure alignment (Fig. 6 a–c): type I, type II, type III, respectively. 91 Notably, in terms of type II, the redox reactions take place on semiconductor A with a low oxidation potential and on semiconductor B with a low reduction potential, respectively, and the corresponding reducibility and oxidizability will decrease. Therefore, Z-scheme photocatalytic system has been put forward and it is suitable for semiconductor combinations, because it can maintain the high reducibility of electrons and high oxidizability of holes (Fig. 6d). 93–101 If semiconductors A and B have suitable band gaps and tight surface conjugation, then an effective charge transfer occurs by redox shuttle and electron mediators, electrostatic adsorption or chemical bonds, forming the Z-scheme heterojunction. 91 , 101–104 Aurivillius phase perovskite oxide such as Bi2WO6, can be combined with other semiconductors to construct heterojunction, so as to extend the light response range. Black phosphorus (BP) has been widely researched in recent years due to its unique optical, chemical and physical properties, as well as response in near infrared (NIR) regions. Therefore, it is normally combined with some semiconductors, such as bismuth-based photocatalysts. 105 , 106 For instance, the monolayer Bi2WO6 (MBWO)/BP heterojunction photocatalysts of Hu’s group exhibited an enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. 74 The band gap energies of BP and monolayer Bi2WO6 were 1.5 ​eV and 2.67 ​eV, respectively. e− in the conduction band of monolayer Bi2WO6 combined with the h+ in the valence band of BP, and the photogenerated electrons remaining in the conduction band of BP were strong enough to produce hydrogen from water splitting (H+/H2 ​= ​0 ​V). Surprisingly, the highest hydrogen evolution rate of 12% BP/MBWO can reach 4208 ​μmol ​h−1 ​g−1. Similarly, Zhu et al. constructed an 2D Z-scheme BP/BiVO4 heterojunction to produce hydrogen and oxygen under visible light irradiation. 76 The morphology of the pure and heterojunction materials are shown in Fig. 7 a–d; and Fig. 7e–h showed the different element components of the heterojunction. In this work, they utilized Co3O4 as a cocatalyst to modify the heterojunction. The heterojunction possessed a suitable band gap whereas the photogenerated electrons transferred from the CB of BiVO4 to the VB of BP (Fig. 7i). With the assistance of the cocatalyst, photocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen evolution activity significantly improved (266.7 ​μmol ​h−1 ​g−1) (Fig. 7j-m). In addition, the sample also showed a good stability after three runs, reaching 240 ​μmol ​h−1 ​g−1 (Fig. 7n–o). BiVO4 combined with other semiconductors through Z-scheme or II-type heterojunction always exhibits an excellent hydrogen evolution activity. On the basis of the original Bi-based work, Hu et al. prepared the Z-scheme ZnIn2S4/BiVO4 hierarchical heterojunction, which has been well utilized in hydrogen production. 107 Notably, its hydrogen production rate reached 5944 ​μmol ​h−1 ​g−1, higher than that of pure ZnIn2S4 and pure BiVO4. This is in line with the concept of heterojunction, constructing a semiconductor photocatalyst with appropriate band gap to improve the photocatalytic activity via combining the advantages of every semiconductor. In addition, the NiO/CDs/BiVO4 composite material prepared by Liu et al. possessed an outstanding hydrogen evolution activity. 108 The composite photocatalysts could realize visible light-driven overall water splitting without using any scavenger, and the optimal hydrogen production rate was 121 ​μmol ​h−1 ​g−1. It also presents satisfactory stability. Notably, NiO’s own transition (Ni 3 ​d8→3 ​d9) could extend the wavelength of useable visible light to over 450 ​nm. Significantly, NiO/CDs/BiVO4 photocatalysts had effective electron separation ability and high electron transfer rates, prolonging the lifetime of photoinduced carriers, thus greatly enhancing the hydrogen evolution activity. In addition, Prof. Kazunari Domen et al. used SrTiO3: La, Rh (La/(La ​+ ​Sr) ​= ​Rh/(Rh ​+ ​Ti) ​= ​4 ​mol%)/Au/BiVO4: Mo (Mo/V ​= ​0.05 ​mol%) to realize overall water splitting reaction, 109 in which Au performed as a bridge to transfer the carriers. The hydrogen production rate was 4750 ​μmol ​h−1 ​g−1 at the annealing temperature of 573 ​K. It is worth mention that the energy conversion from solar to hydrogen in this work exceeded 1%. Moreover, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), with a medium band gap of ca. 2.7 ​eV is a novel metal-free polymeric semiconductor, that exhibits high chemical and thermal stability. 110–114 In addition, g-C3N4 demonstrated a vital influence on the specific surface area, suitable band gap, wide light absorption, separation of carriers, and reduction potentials of Bi-based perovskite oxide for water splitting. Li et al. constructed a heterojunction in which Bi2MoO6 was in situ grown on g-C3N4 with an improved hydrogen evolution activity under visible light irradiation. 115 The author use Pt as a cocatalyst to enhance the hydrogen evolution rate and the critical value of the ratio of Pt was 20%, and found the activity of hydrogen production were decrease when the ratio was more than 20%. Notably, the H2 evolution rate could reach 563.4 ​μmol ​h−1 ​g−1, much higher than that of pure Bi2MoO6 (17.5 ​μmol ​h−1 ​g−1) and g-C3N4 (146.7 ​μmol ​h−1 ​g−1), respectively. However, there is a lack of reports on combining Bi4Ti3O12 with other semiconductors to produce hydrogen via water splitting because the band gap of Bi4Ti3O12 is wider than other Bi-based perovskite oxides. Fortunately, Zhao et al. successfully synthesized Bi2Ti2O7/g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12 ternary heterojunctions with an extensive visible light response and a hydrogen rate of 638 ​μmol ​h−1 ​g−1. 116 Notably, the H2 evolution activity of the heterojunctions increased as the rising temperature due to the increase of activated molecules. Moreover, the prolonged lifetimes of them promoted the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes efficiently. So far, it remains a hurdle to photocatalyze water splitting to generate H2 and O2 simultaneously, because the separation of H2 and O2 is difficult due to an insufficient photoreduction and photooxidation potential. The bandgap of a photocatalyst must be strictly wider than the minimum requirement of 1.23 ​eV. Notably, sufficiently large overpotentials are indispensable at the CB and VB, which are relative to the reduction potential of H+/H2 (0–0.059 ​pH ​eV vs RHE) and the oxidation potential of O2/H2O (+1.23–0.059 ​pH ​eV vs RHE). Fortunately, the Z-scheme heterostructure can be successfully employed to produce H2 and O2 via water splitting. It can also efficiently promote the separation of photogenerated carriers, making them more actively participate in the redox reactions to form ·OH and ·O2 −, eventually enhancing photocatalytic performance. Although significant advances have been made in the construction of abundant Bi2WO6-based hybrids, its photocatalytic near infrared (NIR) response should be further studied."
9,Doping and defect engineering,"3.3 Doping and defect engineering The strategy of introducing impurities into the structure of materials by doping may lead to defects and mediate the characteristics of the semiconductor. Incorporating metal ions into the lattice can largely suppress carriers recombination. 117–127 For example, M. Tayebi et al. prepared BiVO4 co-doped with W and Mo to enhance the performance of PEC hydrogen production. 128 In this work, the doped photocatalysts exhibited porous structures (see Fig. 8 a–d) and the band gap of BiVO4 was determined to be approximately 2.3 ​eV (see Fig. 8e–f). Significantly, the H2 evolution rate of the best sample was 40-fold higher than that of pure BiVO4, due to the rapid separation of photogenerated carriers. The amount of hydrogen evolution reached 19.5 ​μmol ​cm−1 in 2 ​h. Bi-based perovskite oxides with metallic doping usually possess large specific areas, excellent conductivity, high absorption of visible light and large amount of active sites. For instance, Chen et al. doped Cr into Bi4Ti3O12, and the obtained sample achieved a satisfactory photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity with its hydrogen evolution rate reaching 116.75 ​μmol ​h−1 ​g−1. 129 In addition, the samples exhibited outstanding chemical stability. The low EIS for the best sample indicates that the photogenerated electrons and holes could rapidly separate. Moreover, Qiang et al. prepared I doped Bi2O2CO3/Bi2WO6 heterojunction photocatalysts. 130 The resultant sample presents microspheres with dispersed nanoplates (Fig. 8g-o). In this heterojunction system, there existed fully O–O bonding (Fig. 8p–r). Moreover, the best sample exhibited high photocurrent density and low EIS, which enabled I doped Z-scheme system well realize the rapid separation of carriers and achieve the hydrogen evolution rate of 664.5 ​μmol ​h−1 ​g−1. Defect structures can tune the local electronic and bond properties. For example, the existence of oxygen vacancies not only enables the relatively low formation energy and the wide light response range, but also form active atoms with unsaturated coordination, namely, localized electrons and dangling bonds, which lead to the modulation of the electronic states and coordination structures of the adsorbate. 131–134 In Wang’s work, the Bi2WO6-x nanosheets showed outstanding stability and durability, and exhibited highly increased activity owing to the synergistic effect between the Bi quantum dots and oxygen vacancies. 135 In addition, Sun et al. prepared Bi2WO6 nanosheets in which graphene oxide mediated the cogeneration of doped C and oxygen defects. 136 C doping could change the pathway of charge transfer and suppress the recombination of photogenerated carriers. 136 Oxygen vacancies generated could simultaneously facilitate the adsorption and activation of O2, which led to the more efficient formation of reactive ·O2 −. In a word, there are many approaches to introduce oxygen vacancies, such as doping, hydrothermal, reduction, and postsynthetic etching treatments. Although doping can satisfactorily adjust the optical, physical and chemical properties of Bi-based perovskite oxides, there is still an urgent demand for controlling the dopant distribution and adjusting the oxygen vacancy concentration. However, there is a lack of thorough study of doping sites currently. In general, the four types of Bi-based multimetal oxides all possess broad prospects in photocatalytic hydrogen production. Here we summarize the HER performances of these Bi-based multimetal oxide photocatalysts, as shown in Table 1 ."
10,Perspectives and outlook,"With plenty of outstanding properties, including low cost, nontoxicity, environmental friendliness, visible light response, distinctive layered structure, chemical stability, morphological controllability, good dispersity and easy fabrication, Bi-based materials have been applied in hydrogen evolution via water splitting. The band gaps of Bi-based multimetal oxides are almost 2–3 ​eV. This makes them easily to modify by various methods, especially constructing heterojunction interface. Moreover, Bi-based multimetal oxides can extend the light absorption to visible light and in terms of practical value, their application in hydrogen production are of more potential, compared to conventional P25 and CdS. Significantly, the stability of Bi-based multimetal oxides is superior to conventional ones, especially after modifications. Nevertheless, the photocatalytic activities of Bi-based materials are limited by some obstacles, such as their limited visible light response, low surface area, rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers and poor quantum yield. Above all, breakthroughs of Bi-based materials in regard of performance are the most critical. So far, the most difficult hurdle about Bi-based multimetal oxides is the activity of hydrogen production. Therefore, great efforts have been put into overcoming these drawbacks. This review summarizes the recent work on Bi-based heterojunction for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water splitting. Among them, II-type and Z-scheme heterojunctions have been the most studied recently in terms of semiconductor combinations. In addition, morphological control, doping, defect, and metal deposition combined with heterojunction can largely promote the hydrogen evolution activity during water splitting. Although the modification of Bi-based photocatalysts improves their photocatalytic performance, there still exist many challenges with them. First, there is a lack of in situ measurement technology to directly visualize the dynamics and structure. Moreover, there are few studies about the relationship between the facet exposure and photocatalytic performance. Although great breakthroughs have been made in improving the photocatalytic performance of Bi-based photocatalysts, plenty of disagreements about the specific mechanisms behind the improved photocatalytic activity have been left, such as the transfer paths of photoinduced carriers in regard to metal deposition. In addition, the application of Bi-based photocatalysts should be popularized to some ohter fields (like environmental remediation), rather than only focused on hydrogen production. In future research work on the practical application of Bi-based photocatalysts, we should pay attention to the following points: (I) Design porous structure with co-exposed surface. (II) Combine morphological control, doping, defect structure and heterostructure to suppress the recombination of photoinduced carriers. (III) In terms of semiconductor combination, take the advantage of Z-scheme heterojunction used in water splitting to maximize the utilization of resources. (IV) Introduce in situ growth method to construct heterostructures. Among them, low-dimensional morphology materials (such as 0D quantum dot and 1D nanofiber, especially nanofiber) show more advantages. These materials can be prepared by electrospinning, and coaxial electrospinning is of great prospects, especially in water splitting to H2. (V) Photoelectric synergy is the most mainstream catalysis direction in the future. Therefore, combining the advantages of photocatalysis and electrocatalysis may make the hydrogen production performance of Bi-based multimetal oxides a great leap forward."
