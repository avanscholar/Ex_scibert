0,Introduction,"The excessive consumption of fossil fuels leads to dramatically rise of atmospheric CO2 concentration. Capturing CO2 to produce fuels or chemicals is an important approach for the carbon–neutral economy. Microbial electrosynthesis (MES) provides one of the most promising ways for converting CO2 into organic matter (e.g. CH4, acetate, and alcohol) [1,2]. In this system, renewable electricity is used to oxidize H2O to form O2, H+ , and e− in the anodic chamber, and then H+ and e− are transported to the cathode chamber in which they are used by autotrophic microbes to fix CO2 [3]. So far, the main products of MES were still methane and acetate, but the low current density (i.e. low production rate) and low energy efficiency hampered its practical application [3,4]. Several methods have been deployed to improve the current density of biofilm-based MES: 1) enrichment of functional microbes and genetically modification of microorganisms; 2) modification of cathode materials; 3) optimization of reactor operation conditions [5–8]. All the above-mentioned methods have based the strategy to promote cathodic biofilm formation and enhance the extracellular electron transfer (EET) from cathode to microbes. However, these strategies are limited by the following reasons other than inherent metabolic rates restriction of microbes: 1) the increase of the biofilm thickness is highly limited by the cathode spatial structure [9]; 2) the diffusion of reactants from the bulk electrolyte to the interior biofilm close to cathode was limited in dense biofilm (e.g. thickness over 400 μm); 3) electrons (or electron carriers) are depleted before reaching the exterior biofilm surface, and thus products and OH– build-up could result in decreased stability or productivity [10]. More importantly, the required current density for the practical application of MES needed to be above 500–1000 A·m−2, however, it is insufficient to meet this value by scaling-up biofilm-based MES (only 10–100 A·m−2) [11] because the current density does not increase linearly with the scale-up of the effective surface area of the cathode. Thus, strategies that promote biomass catalytic capacity beyond the limitation of dense biofilm are more desirable. The cathodic EET mechanisms include direct transfer through the membrane-bound redox systems and indirect transfer mediated by H2 or formate [12]. Theoretically, H2 could be in situ generated at the cathode and then being consumed by suspended microbes to produce CH 4 without the limitation of biofilm and electrode surface area. The electrolytic H2 evolution is kinetically more facile than biofilm-based bioelectrochemical CO2 reduction and could achieve a high current density with a very low energy input simultaneously [13]. Moreover, the catholyte is rich in ultrafine hydrogen bubbles and is supersaturated with dissolved H2 [14]. The ultrafine bubbles provide more interface between gas and liquid phases [15]. If H2 could be continuously generated from electrolysis and sufficient CO2 is supplied, suspended autotrophic microbes could rapidly synthesize biomass and bio-based products [16]. Thus, these suspended-microbes-driven MES systems hold more potential for achieving the requirement of current density and overall current-to-methane efficiency of the practical application of MES. Several studies have deployed to use in situ electrolytically generated H2 as the feedstock of suspended autotrophic microbes to power the biochemical reduction of CO2, which offered possibilities for industrial application of MES [17,18]. While this integrated platform also presents a significant challenge because of the limited solubility of H2 with 0.79 mM in water at ambient conditions [19]. Although a higher current density with suitable cathode material could lead to a high flux of H2 evolution [20], a higher H2 evolution rate is not readily translated to a high CO2 reduction rate. The mass transfer of H2 to autotrophic microbes is the rate-determining factor of this integrated MES process [13,17]. Ensuring even mass transfer at the gas–liquid-microbes interface is beneficial to promote the productivity of MES. It should be noted that ideal reactor design contributes to strengthening mass transfer, for example, forced-flow-through flat-reactor reached higher current density and productivity than H-type reactors with magnetic stirring [21]. However, improving the mass transfer of H2-mediated MES from the reactor design aspect has not been reported yet. Moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) has the potential for making the suspended bio-carriers turn into a fluidized state by aeration and flow promotion in a reaction tank. The bio-carriers could disperse large bubbles and thus increase the retention time and gas–liquid mass transfer under efficient mixing, and it offers a chance for biomass growth as well [22]. Taking these advantages, it has been widely used in the aerobic mode for municipal and industrial wastewater treatment, aquaculture, potable water denitrification [23,24], but its usage in MES for CH4 production from CO2 and H2 has not been reported thus far. The carriers are beneficial for dispersing large H2 bubbles into small bubbles. Gas recirculation was designed to prolong H2 retention time in the reactor. Thus, we postulated that utilization of the advantages of MBBR could accelerate the kinetics of H2 mass transfer in the MES process and thereby alleviate the H2 solubility constraints. Here we developed an electrolytic-hydrogen-fed MBBR reactor (Electro-MBBR) in which the cathode and anode were designed at the bottom of the reactor to in situ generate H2 nano- or micro-bubbles (Fig. 1 ). The MBBR part was placed on the top of the electrodes to increase the retention time of the H2 bubbles in the reactor. Gases were continuously recirculated by a gas recirculation pump to increase H2 retention time. Three different currents (1, 2, and 5 A) were applied corresponding to three different CO2 flow rates (2, 4.1, and 10.3 mL·min−1) to study the effect of high current density on CO2 conversion efficiency. Temporal dynamics in the microbial communities, methane, and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) production were closely followed over 38 days and linked to different operational conditions."
1,Material and methods,
2,Electro-MBBR reactor design and construction,"2.1 Electro-MBBR reactor design and construction The design of the novel Electro-MBBR reactor can be seen in Fig. 1 and S1a. The reactor was made from PVC plastics and it consisted of a tubular electrolyzer (height 19.0 cm) at the bottom and a modified MBBR at the top. The electrolyzer was composed of a tubular anode, a tubular cathode, and a tubular CEM (10 cm × 24 cm, Hangzhou Xinhui Membrane Technology Co., Ltd., China) to separate anode and cathode. The anode was an IrO2-coated Ti mesh (8 cm × 9 cm, Baoji Zhiming Special Metal Co., Ltd, China). The cathode was made from a 9 cm × 50 cm stainless steel perforated mesh (304 L, round hole diameter: 4 mm, thickness: 0.5 mm, Anguo Chengli Metal Co., Ltd, China), of which was twisted into a spiral shape with a diameter of 5.5 cm (Fig. S1c). The anode column was 19.0 cm in height and 11 cm in diameter. The cathode column was connected with the modified MBBR column, and had a total height of 127.5 cm with 6.4 cm diameter and increase the diameter to 10 cm at 105 cm. The working volumes for the anolyte and catholyte were 1 L and 4.5 L, respectively. The Electro-MBBR reactor was equipped with a gas recirculating pump (UV-U1, You Cheng Industrial Co., Ltd., China), a CO2 mass flow controller (D07-7, Beijing Sevenstar Flow Co., Ltd, China), a pH controller (Huzhou Tianze Biological Technology Co., Ltd., China) and a silicon heating pad (20 cm × 40 cm). The introducing CO2 and the generated H2 and CH4 were recirculated from bottom to top via a gas recirculation pump. The reactor was filled with 0.5 L of a cylindrical high-density polyethylene ring-shaped carrier (AnoxKaldnes, K1 carrier) to disperse large bubbles generated by gas recirculation and increase mass transfer efficiency [25]. The off-gas coming out of the scrubbing bottle was connected to a water displacement column (filled with 250 mL 5 mM H2SO4) to measure gas flow rate."
3,Reactor startup and operation,"2.2 Reactor startup and operation A modified M9 medium was used as the cathodic electrolyte which contains 6 g·L−1 Na2HPO4, 3 g·L−1 KH2PO4, 0.5 g·L−1 NH4Cl, 0.5 g·L−1 NaCl, 0.1·gL−1 MgSO4·7H2O, 14.6 mg·L−1 CaCl2, 1 mL ·L−1 trace element solution, and 0.1 mL ·L−1 vitamin solution [26]. The compositions of the trace metal solution and vitamin solution are provided in the supporting information (SI) Table S1. The catholyte was sparged with N2 gas for 20 min before feeding to the cathode chamber, and afterward, CO2 was bubbled into the catholyte as a carbon source. The anodic chamber was filled will 1 L phosphate buffer solution (6 g·L−1 Na2HPO4, 3 g·L−1 KH2PO4). The cathodic chamber was inoculated with 214 mL effluent from a single-chamber microbial electrolysis cell that was fed with glucose. The temperature was controlled at 37 ± 0.5 ℃ by the silicone heating pad. Half of the cathodic medium was replaced after operating for 26 d when the OD value gradually decreased. The reactor was replenished 1 mL·L−1 trace element, 0.1 mL·L−1 vitamin and 0.5 g·L−1 NH4Cl at day 12 and 20 when the concentration of NH4-N decreased below 0.20 g·L−1. The reactor was operated in the galvanostatic mode controlled by a DC power supply (KA3005P, KORAD), and the cathode chamber was continuously bubbled with pure CO2 through a mass flow controller. The operation conditions of the Electro-MBBR are summarized in Table 1 . The CO2 was over-feeding over the entire operation (H2/CO2 ratio was around 3.65:1) to ensure maximum H2 conversion. The reactor was run in continuous gas-supply mode and the gas was circulated at a rate of 2 L·h−1. The catholyte pH was automatically maintained around 7 by the pH controller using a 5 M NaOH solution to avoid acidification due to the VFAs production. When the catholyte pH exceeded 7.5 due to the consumption of protons and CO2, it was manually adjusted with 2 M HCl. Anolyte was periodically added to compensate for the water consumption induced by water electrolysis and evaporation. The catholyte was sampled daily to quantify OD600 and products concentration. Each time, 30 mL of liquid sample was taken and the same amount of fresh medium was added to the reactor to maintain 4.5 L working volume. 5 mL of the sample were used for OD600 measurement, and the rest was frozen for VFAs and microbial community analysis. The reactor was operated for another cycle under galvanostatic currents of 1 A and 2 A to test its reproducibility."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The gas flow rates were measured by the water displacement method for a period of 2 h. The gas samples were taken periodically from the scrubbing bottle and immediately analyzed by GC after measuring the gas flow rates. The gas composition of CO2, H2, CH4 were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC, 7890B, Agilent) equipped with a TCD detector, an FID detector and an HP-PLOT Al2O3 S PT column, a HyasSep Q + MolSieve 5A column and a Porapak Q column. Pure helium was used as the carrier gas at a total flow rate of 69 mL·min−1, and the temperature of the injector, the column, and the detector was 90 ℃, 250 ℃, and 250 ℃, respectively. The presence of VFAs from C2 to C4 in liquid samples from the reactor were extracted by diethyl ether first and then analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-2010 Pro, AOC-201, Shimadzu) with an FID detector and capillary column (SH-Rtx-1, L30 m × ID 0.25 mm × DF 1.0 mm). Pure nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 9.4 mL·min−1, the temperature of the injector and the detector were 250 ℃ and 320 ℃, respectively. The temperature–time programming of the column was set as follows: 1) held at 90 ℃ for 3 min; 2) increased to 200 ℃ at a rate of 30 ℃ per min and held for 1 min; 3) further increased to 260 ℃ at a rate of 30 ℃ per min and held for 1.20 min. Suspended microorganism concentrations were measured by OD at 600 nm. All the analyses were carried out in triplicates. The volumetric mass transfer coefficient of H2 (kLa, h−1) describes the H2 transfer resistance (or efficiency) through the gas–liquid interface, which could be measured by the dynamic-gasing method as already reported [27]. The reactor was filled with M9 medium without inoculum. Temperature and pH were set at 37 ℃ and 7, respectively. The system was assembled with a dissolved hydrogen sensor (Clean, DH200, China) at the external recirculation loop of the column to measure and record dissolved H2 concentrations. The kLa of pure H2 flushing, electrolysis, electrolysis with gas recirculation, and electrolysis with recirculation and carriers were measured under the same liquid volume, N2 sparging rate, and stirring speed. For each experiment, the reactor was first degassed with N2 and then flushed with pure H2 or electrolytic H2 for around 30 min until reaching saturation. Afterward, stopping supplying H2, the dissolved H2 concentration decreased by natural exchange through the gas–liquid interface. The dissolved hydrogen sensor data was recorded every 1 min until equilibrium was reached. The kLa was calculated according to the exponential curve following desorbing equation [27,28]: (1) c t = c 0 × exp ( - k L a × t ) The coulombic efficiency (CE), energy efficiency (ηenergy ), and reaction yield (Y) were calculated as described in the literature (Eqs. (2)–(4)) [7,29,30] to reflect the productivity and the energy efficiency ratio of the reactor: (2) CE = F M p , j n e ∫ 0 t Idt (3) η energy = ∑ j M p , j × G f , j I E cell t (4) Y = Mas s product Mas s substrate With F, Faraday’s constant; Mp,j , product (s) (mol); ne, the number of electrons required for the products; I, current (A); Gf,j, the free energy content in the product j; Ecell , the voltage over the system (V)."
5,"DNA extraction, sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis","2.4 DNA extraction, sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis Inoculum samples and the samples of suspended cells in the catholyte solution after the reactor being operating for 0 d, 5 d, 11 d, 15 d, 23 d, 26 d, 31 d, and 35 d were collected, respectively. DNA was extracted from the samples through three freeze–thaw cycles. Total isolated DNA was visualized on a 1% agarose gel and quantified using the NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit (Thermo Scientific). Samples were provided to Majorbio Institute (Shanghai, China) for 16S rRNA Amplicon paired-end sequencing by Illumina Miseq Platform using the primers 338F (ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG) and 806R (GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT). Quantification of archaea was carried out by primers 524F10extF (TGYCAGCCGCCGCGGTAA) and Arch958RmodR (YCCGGCGTTGAVTCCAATT). Triplicates were combined, quantified, and sample amplicons were pooled equally. Sequence data processing of primer and adapter sequences removal, denoising, error correction, paired-end read merging, chimera removal, and dereplication were performed using DADA2 pipeline [31]. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was performed by XLSTAT (an Addinsoft to excel) to describe the correlations between environmental variables, samples, and microbial compositions [32]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,kLa determination and dissolved H2 concentration,"3.1 kLa determination and dissolved H2 concentration The kLa was measured under different conditions to determine the mass transfer rate of dissolved H2 in the gas–liquid interface (Fig. 2 a). Electrolytic generated H2 was beneficial for enhancing the gas–liquid interface mass transfer. Indeed, as evidence in the pure H2 flushing, and the 1 A current applied tests, the kLa increased from 0.062 to 0.109 h−1. When gas recirculation was switched on (2 L·h−1), the kLa rapidly increased to 0.56 h−1, which is 9 times high than that by sparging pure H2. The kLa continued to increase to 1.02 h−1 after carriers being added. More surprisingly, the dissolved H2 concentration gradually increased from 0.51 to 0.82 mg·L−1 under electrolysis with gas recirculation and carriers condition after 30 min decrease (Fig. 2b). This is because that the carriers could enhance gas holdup [33] and thus increase dissolved H2 retention time. Moreover, it could disperse large gas bubbles to smaller bubbles to increase gas–liquid interfacial area as well [34]. These results confirmed that the electrolysis and carriers were favorable for accelerating the mass transfer rate between the gas–liquid interface via increasing H2 mass transfer efficiency and retention time."
8,CH4 and C2-C4 VFA production,"3.2 CH4 and C2-C4 VFA production The CH4, H2, and VFAs production over time under different galvanostatic currents is shown in Fig. 3 . The reactor was operated to investigate the effect of applied currents for in situ H2 evolution on the production of chemicals over 38 days. To facilitate acclimation of the microbial community, the reactor was operated under gradually increased current from 1 A to 5 A. The OD600 of the cathodic medium represents the suspended biomass, and it increased from 0.002 after inoculum to 0.027 after 3 days operation (Fig. 3a). The maximum of OD600 reached 0.507 at day 23 with 2 A, and then gradually dropped down to 0.178 (at day 26) before cathodic medium replacement. The concentration of NH4-N declined from 500 mg·L−1 to around 187 mg·L−1 on day 26 before cathodic medium replacement, which suggested that the depletion of nutrients led to the decline of biomass [35,36]. Subsequent recovery of the OD600 value reached 0.466 after replacing the cathodic medium confirmed the above-mentioned as well. The OD600 value quickly decreased to 0.166 after switching current to 5 A, which was likely caused by the toxicity of catholyte alkalization to microbes (Fig. S2). Meanwhile, vigorous H2 evolution at 5 A led to the floatation of microbes from the gas outlet and eventually the decrease of OD600 as well. CH4 was the predominant product in this kind of Electro-MBBR reactor when being galvanostatic operated at 1 A. The production rate of CH4 was fairly low after inoculation as being expected, but it gradually increased after only 2 d operation and was stabled around 0.57 L·L−1·d−1. The overall VFAs concentration gradually increased to 2.03 g·L−1 with a fluctuated production rate, and 76% of the produced VFAs was acetate (Fig. 3b). The production rate of acetate slightly increased to 12.05 mM·d−1 at day 9 first and then quickly decreased until operated for 12 d (Fig. S3). The other VFAs, such as propionate and butyrate were detected until being operated for 3 d with very low concentrations (below 0.2 g·L−1, Fig. 3b and c). The acetogenic population probably developed in the compartment, which resulted in a slight fluctuation of acetate production. Almost all the electrolytically generated H2 was consumed by the reactor (Fig. 3d). After the galvanostatic current increased to 2 A, the CH4 production rate decreased from 1.02 L·L−1·d−1 to 0.57 L·L−1·d−1 from day 13 to day 18, while the acetate production rate increased during the same period. Thereafter, the CH4 production rate quickly rebounded and reached its maximum of 1.20 L·L−1·d−1 on day 24, while the concentration of VFAs decreased to 1.77 g·L−1 at day 21 and then increased to 2.84 g·L−1 at day 25 (Fig. 3c). The disturbance of cathodic medium replacement resulted in the decline of CH4 and VFAs production at day 26, and finally, the CH4 production rate rose to around 1.1 L·L−1·d−1, while the VFAs production rate declined to 4.54 mM·d−1 (Fig. S3a). During the entire operation, the VFAs production rate sharply increased when the OD600 started to drop at some days, which could be attributed to the degradation of the biomass (Fig. 3a and S3). It also can be observed from Fig. 3d that the uptake of electrolytically-generated H2 utilization nearly reached beyond 70% except for some slight fluctuation when being galvanostatic operated at 1 A and 2 A. The CO2 uptake reached 83.8% after being operated for 3 d and was kept with near 99% utilization efficiency when being operated at 1 A, while it fluctuated at the next stage corresponding with CH4 and VFAs production (Fig. 3b and d). When the galvanostatic current was increased to 5 A, current density as high as 111.1 A·m−2 could be used to support vigorous H2 evolution. The maximum production rate of CH4 was achieved based on projective cathode surface area (141.5 L·m−2 cat·d−1) and cathodic volume (1.42 L·L−1·d−1). Whereas, the productivity of CH4 remained over 1.1 L·L−1·d−1 (105.8 L·m−2 cat·d−1) only for the first 3 days operation and then sharply decreased below 0.65 L·L−1·d−1 after being operated for 34 d and slightly recovered during day 35–38. The productivity deterioration of this system was owing to the alkalinization of the catholyte and floatation of microbes resulting from hydrogen evolution (Fig. 3a and S2). Simultaneously, essential cations for microbes growth, such as Mg2+, Ca2+, have been deposited on the cathode surface due to the local alkalinization at the cathode-electrolyte interface (Fig. S4). It can also be seen that at the first two stages, the H2 and CO2 uptake efficiency were maintained over 80% excluding the replenishment of NH4-N and displacement of catholyte. Replicated experiment of the reactor was done under galvanostatic current of 1 A and 2 A (Fig. S5). It can be seen from the repeatability test that the trend of the CH4 production rate and the VFA production were in great agreement with the results in Fig. 3b. The H2 and CO2 uptake efficiency were as high as 100% and 80%, respectively (Fig. S5b). All of the results mentioned above indicated that this reactor configuration could dramatically promote H2 uptake by microbes in the reactor."
9,Electron balance and energy conversion,"3.3 Electron balance and energy conversion The electron balance could estimate electron utilization efficiency in this reactor, it could be calculated following Eq. (2). Most of the electrons ended up in CH4 and the residual H2, the rest were transferred to VFAs and biomass (Fig. 4 ). Electrons attributed to CH4 production increased from ~ 2% to ~ 91% within 7 days, which was then stabled around 88% until the end of galvanostatic operation at 1 A. While the electrons ended up in acetate increased from ~ 4.6% at 2 d to ~ 48% (9 d) and sharply decreased to ~ 0% at the end of this stage. After switching to 2 A, the percentage of electrons that went to CH4 decreased from day 13 to 18, while the electrons ended in H2 increased over this period (from 10.2% to 57.7%). When the galvanostatic current continued to rise at 5 A, H2 accounted for nearly 80% of the total electrons, and CH4 accounted for ~ 30%-45% of the total electrons. In general, the average CE of CH4 and VFAs (electrons to CH4 and VFAs production efficiency) decreased as the galvanostatic current increased, while the average CE of H2 was just the opposite. On some days when the CE exceeded 100%, there is no significant change in VFA concentration while the OD600 decreased sharply. Hence, this phenomenon verified our hypothesis that the degradation of biomass resulted in the CE being greater than 100%. Excluding the catholyte refreshed and the system start-up phase, the average (maximum) CE of CH4 (electrons to CH4 efficiency) for the three stages were 85.8% (96.5%), 72.3% (92.5%), and 20.7% (45.7%), respectively. And the total CE for CH4 and VFAs production was all close to 100% except for catholyte refreshed at 1 A and 2 A. To further analyze the system efficiency, the energy efficiency, reaction yield is shown in Fig. 5 . Energy efficiency would undoubtedly be a suitable indicator to represent the part of the electrical energy that ends up in the CH4, H2, and VFAs. The highest energy efficiency was 43.4% at 1 A, 39.6% at 2 A and only 29.7% at 5 A (Figs. 4 and 5a). Nearly 25%-30% of the electrical energy was consumed for CH4 production after system start-up, and less than 10% of the electrical was contributed to VFAs production (Fig. S6). The reaction yield could denote the amount of products converted from CO2 [7]. The fluctuation of the reaction yield was consistent with the productivity of chemicals from CO2. The system exhibited a substantially higher reaction yield over 0.6 to 0.9 except for operation at 5 A (Fig. 5b). Actually, although high current densities could support strong H2 evolution, the short residence time of H2 and low OD600 value caused by alkalization of catholyte and biomass flotation limited the promotion of the system productivity. Thus, it is necessary to promote H2 evolution rate and residence time and keep pH around neutral to enhance this kind of Electro-MBBR system productivity."
10,Microbial community analysis,"3.4 Microbial community analysis Microbial community analysis was performed at inoculum, 0 d, 5 d, 11 d, 15 d, 23 d, 26 d, 31 d, and 35 d to analyze the effect of the galvanostatic current on the microbial community structures compared to the initial inoculum (Fig. 6 ). Methanobacterium were predominant in the inoculum and accounted for 97.9%, and the rest of the methanogenic consortia in the inoculum were Methanobrevibacter (Fig. 6a). Methanobrevibacter acts as a strict hydrogenotrophic methanogen by using only H2/CO2 for methanogenesis, while Methanobacterium could ferment VFA, carbohydrate, amino acid, etc [37,38]. That’s why Methanobrevibacter gradually became the specific microorganism in the entire galvanostatic operation. Based on the results above, it is conceivable that in situ coupling of electrochemical hydrogen production and microbial CO2 fixation via hydrogen contributed to the enrichment of strictly hydrogenotrophic methanogens. The domination of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes belonged to 6 phylas (Fig. S7), namely Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes, Synergistetes, and Actinobacteria. The dominated genus of the inoculum was Geobacter (49.4%), a typical electrochemical active bacteria which belonged to the Proteobacteria phyla, however, it was not detected in the subsequent microbial electrosynthesis process (Fig. 6b and S8). Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla were dominated during the galvanostatic operation process, accounting for over 76.1% of the communities. Firmicutes are well-known to produce butyrate as its metabolic end product and Bacteroidetes phyla have been reported to metabolize amino acids to produce various VFAs [39]. The rise in the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla from 12.5% and 15.2% to 64.3% and 23.5% for the initial inoculum and suspended microbes after being operated for 15 d (Fig. S7), respectively, verified that the CE beyond 100% in the Electro-MBBR system came from protein degradation. Relative abundance of Petrimonas and Proteiniborus (belong to Bacteroidetes) increased from 2.1% and ~ 0.03% to 24.1% and 5.4% at 35 d, respectively, further proved the results mentioned above (Fig. 6b and S7-S8). At the genus level (Fig. 6b), it can be noted that the suspended community compositions were different from the original inoculum source. Sporomusa were enriched to 74.3% after operation for 5 d from the collective relative abundance of 4% in the initial inoculum and accounted for 32.8% to 61.8% in the entire operation except day 23 and day 35. Sporomusa genera is a gram-negative anaerobic acetogen that could use CO2 and H2 to produce acetate [40–42]. The predominated of Sporomusa agreed with the acetate production rate. Canonical correspondence analysis was performed to highlight the correlation between current density and CH4 production, acetate production, pH as well as microbial compositions (Fig. 7 a and b). Strong positive correlations can be seen between current density and CH4 production (Fig. 7a), which is coincided with the observed CH4 production in Fig. 3b. However, the pH has less effect on CH4 production compared with current density. It is also noted that Methanobrevibacter which corresponds to a higher CH4 production rate at 11 d, 15 d, 26 d, and 31 d. Sporomusa, Petrimonas, Proteiniphilum, Pseudomonas, and Azospira were correlated with acetate production at 11 d, 15 d, 23 d, 26 d, and 31 d, while Dechlorobacter, Lentimicrobium, and Sphaerochaeta were negatively correlated with that of acetate production, which corresponds to acetate production dynamics in the entire operation. Therefore, maintaining a higher current density is suggested to facilitate CH4 and acetate production."
11,Discussion,"3.5 Discussion The productivity of this Electro-MBBR reactor and the previous methane-producing MES reactors are summarized in Table 2 . Most studies are devoted to improving biofilm formation by developing cathodes with a higher affinity for biofilm attachment or focused on developing biological induced H2 evolution to drive a high rate of chemical production (Table 2). The highest CH4 production rate based on projective cathode surface area (65 L·m−2 cat·d−1) were achieved on granular active carbon cathode with fixed current density (35 A·m−2), while that based on cathodic volume (0.54 L·L−1·d−1) were achieved on carbon cloth cathode with extreme negative cathode potential (-1.15 V). However, the maximum CH4 productivity of this Electro-MBBR reactor was nearly 2 times (L·m−2 cat·d−1) and 2.4 times (L·L−1·d−1) higher than the highest CH4 production rate mentioned above. Surprisingly, the average CE of this Electro-MBBR reactor reached 73.2% as well. Although a 50 L pilot-scale reactor was studied in the previous research, the CH4 production rate was only 0.25 L·m−2 cat·d−1 (0.01 L·L−1·d−1), which is extremely lower than that of the Electro-MBBR reactor. For H2 induced CO2 reduction, the kinetic of H2 oxidation by hydrogenases is rate-determining as H2 has limited solubility in water at ambient conditions [18]. Taking the advantage of MBBR, this research achieved as high as 100% of H2 utilization efficiency during the whole operation. When the electrochemical water splitting reaction takes place, the generated H2 is delivered by gas recirculation or carriers in the aqueous medium. The process of H2 transfer as a reducing equivalent to microbes is significantly accelerated along with gas recirculation and carriers. Such an accelerated H2 transfer led to higher mass transfer of the gas–liquid-microbes interface and realize nearly 100% H2 utilization and 90% overall reaction yield. We noted that gas recirculation and H2 bubbles attached to the carriers increase the hydrogen retention time in the liquid medium (Fig. 2b). Meanwhile, the higher current density offered a desirable electron supply to enhance the CO2 reduction rate, the higher H2 transfer facilitated CO2 reduction reaction yield. Therefore, this study performed competitive productivity compared to previous studies, which corresponded with the maximum CH4 production rate of 141.5 L·m−2·d−1 (1.42 L·L−1·d−1) and the highest acetate production of 18.7 mM·d−1 as well. Moreover, suspended microbes were benefited from the higher contacting surface between gas and microbes without being limited by electrode surface area compared to that biofilm-based microbes. All in all, these results highlight that the surprising perspective of this Electro-MBBR reactor for CH4 production, and provide a new road for other H2 induced bioprocesses, such as carboxylic acid production [2], denitrification [43], and single-cell protein production [44]. Matching the fast abiotic H2 evolution and slow biotic CO2 reduction is the key challenge to achieve a desired microbial electrochemical CO2 conversion efficiency in this designed Electro-MBBR reactor. Thus, we took advantage of gas recirculation and carriers to increase dissolved hydrogen concentration, elongation H2 retention time, and increase biomass amount to promote microbe-gas–liquid interface mass transfer. Even more strikingly, most of the electrochemically produced H2 was used to produce CH4, only 1%~2% H2 was left in the off-gas when a steady state was reached. This low hydrogen percentage is allowed to be injected into the natural gas pipeline. Moreover, the presence of H2 in the compressed CH4 could improve the fuel-burning efficiency of the internal combustion engine [45]. However, the dissolved hydrogen concentration in this study (0.55 mM) is only 18% to 27% of some electrolyzers (2–3 mM) [46], the gas–liquid interface mass transfer could be further promoted to enhance CH4 production. Thus, it is significant to take strategies to increase dissolved hydrogen concentration to reach the over-saturation of dissolved hydrogen. In addition, nano- or micro- H2 bubbles are beneficial for increasing H2 retention time in the reactor and thus promoting gas–liquid-microbes interface mass transfer. More details on the H2 bubbles distribution and the gas–liquid-microbes interface mass transfer rate need to be investigated. The maximum CH4 productivity of this study (~1.4 L·L−1·d−1) is one of the best among reported biofilm-based MES reactors, but it is still 12 times lower than other biological methanation of CO2 and H2 process (15.4 L·L−1·d−1) [47]. The main reason can be attributed to the much lower biomass in the reactor than that in other biological methanation of CO2 and H2 (OD less than 1 vs. OD greater than 10). In this reactor, we did not see obvious biofilm formation on the carrier surface. SEM images of the carrier showed microbes only sparsely attached on the surface with low density (Fig. S9). Thus, it was mainly the suspended microbes that were producing methane from H2 and CO2. The role of the carriers in the reactor was mainly a gas mass transfer enhancer rather than a biofilm carrier. The poor biofilm formation was likely caused by the shear force in the reactor was too high and the biocompatibility of the carrier was not high enough. On the other hand, although continuous gas recirculation could increase the H2 retention time in the column and higher current density led to vigorous H2 evolution, they cause some suspended microbes to float out of the reactor at high current density, and this biological inert of the polyethylene carriers are not conducive to microbes attachment as well. Carriers that have a good bio-compatibility with microbes attaching, especially that are conductive to methanogens adhesion could effectively avoid microbial floating out of the reactor and increase biomass for CH4 production from CO2 and H2. Besides, carriers that have a good binding affinity with H2 bubbles could increase dissolved hydrogen concentration as well. Thus, more work needs to be done on increasing the bio-compatibility and hydrogen affinity of carriers to increase the attached biomass on carriers and dissolved hydrogen concentration."
12,Conclusion,"This study developed a novel Electro-MBBR reactor in which an electrochemical cell was designed at the bottom and an MBBR column was designed on the top for microbial electrosynthesis of methane. This system achieved excellent performance with a maximum CH4 and acetate production rate of 1.42 L·L−1·d−1 (141.5 L·m−2 cat·d−1) and 18.5 mM·d−1, respectively, and maximum reaction yield and energy efficiency were 0.92 mol·mol−1 CO2·d−1 and 39.6%, respectively. The reactor reported here achieved the best CH4 productivity along with 3.74 g·L−1 VFAs among the previous MES system. At the galvanostatic current (current density) of 2 A (44 A·m−2 cat), the maximum coulombic efficiency of CH4 (electrons to CH4 efficiency) reached 92.5%. Gas recirculation and carrier could facilitate the mass transfer rate of H2 bubbles to the methanogens. The reactor design reported here provides a stepping-stone for the future optimization and developments of efficient microbial electrosynthesis. Further studies should be carried on to verify the H2 bubbles distribution and H2 transfer rate in the gas–liquid-microbes interface in the reactor. Additionally, strategies on carrier modification to improve its affinity for microbes and H2 could further increase biomass in the reactor and enhance energy efficiency with higher current density."
