0,Introduction,"Nowadays, the necessity to release energy production from oil and natural gas as primary energy sources and, more in general, to diversify such sources in order to assure supply makes the interest in membrane reactor (MR) technology more pressing. Moreover, the increasing effort dedicated to the reduction of environmental problems has recently led to the development of clean technologies, designed to enhance both the efficiency and environmental acceptability of energy production, storage and use, in particular for power generation (Wadhwani et al., 2002). Among the clean technologies, the exploitation of light hydrocarbons is surely the main realistic energy source, allowing both power generation and environmental-friendly fuel production, with a specific reference to hydrogen. In particular, the stream coming out of a reformer or of a coal gasification plant is of great industrial interest because it contains around 50% of hydrogen (in dry condition) that must be recovered and between 40–45% of CO that, usually, can be reduced in an upgrading stage, producing more hydrogen at the same time. In traditional applications, the upgrading of reformate streams is performed by using a multi-stage CO-shift process, with an intermediate carbon dioxide absorption stage and a final CO2 removal process. CO + H 2 O = CO 2 + H 2 Δ H 298 K 0 = - 41 kJ mol - 1 Water gas shift (WGS) reaction is exothermic (ΔH=−41.165kJmol−1) and favoured by a low temperature; on the other hand, by reducing the temperature, the catalyst activity decreases, with a consequent lower reaction rate. Therefore, in accordance with the commercial CO shift systems (widely used in the petrochemical industry), the traditional process is based on a series of catalytic reactors: the first, operating at high temperatures (about 350–400°C), taking advantage of the high reaction rate, converts a large portion of carbon monoxide giving hydrogen and CO2, the others, operating at a low temperature (around 220–300°C), refine the carbon monoxide conversion, thus allowing a lower CO final concentration (less than 1% molar) (Raggio et al., 2005). The H2 rich stream coming out from the last reactor is sent to a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit for H2 separation from the other gases. It should be pointed out that the new utilization of H2 as feed in fuel cells for mobile power sources requires the anode inlet gas to have a CO concentration lower than 10–20ppm (Barbir, 2005) in order to avoid catalyst poisoning with consequent drops in the cell efficiency. Hence, the purification step of the H2 produced from hydrocarbon or alcohol reforming, must be very efficient in order to reduce the CO level to cell requirements. A Pd–Ag membrane reactor allows these different units to substituted, combining the reaction and H2 separation in a single step. The Pd–Ag membrane placed in the reactor, showing a hydrogen infinite selectivity, allows the selective removal of this reaction product from reaction volume, implying several advantages with respect to the traditional operations: • Increasing of residence time of reactants • Exceeding of the equilibrium of a traditional reactor • Positive effect of feed pressure on CO conversion Furthermore, it must be considered that WGS is a reaction limited by thermodynamic equilibrium, which happens without changes in the mole number, thus not being influenced by the reaction pressure from a thermodynamic point of view. In the case of the upgrading of a syngas mixture the maximum conversion achievable in a TR (TREC) cannot be higher than 36% (Fig. 1 ), in the temperature range investigated in this work (270–330°C). By preliminary experimental tests on a TR, in fact, it was shown that CO conversion did not exceed 20% at all the operating conditions. The highest CO conversion is achieved at 300°C. At a lower temperature, in fact, the limitations imposed by kinetics were relevant due to the fact that the kinetic is favoured by the increasing of the temperature (Amadeo and Laborde, 1995). the However, for a temperature higher than 300°C the thermodynamics limitations on CO conversion are stricter. Thus, among the several advantages that are more important in the upgrading of a reformate stream offered by an MR, the positive effect of the feed pressure on the system performance becomes strongly relevant. Since the driving force for the permeation is the reaction pressure, it acts positively on the reaction pushing it towards further product formation (Barbieri et al., 2001, 2005; Kikuchi et al., 1989). Another way to show this positive effect on the reaction is also to consider that to achieve the same conversion of a TR, the catalyst amount necessary for an MR can be significantly reduced. For instance, only 25% of the catalyst required by a TR is necessary in a Pd-alloy MR to reach 90% of the equilibrium conversion of a TR operating at 280°C and 1000kPa (Barbieri et al., 2005). In this context , the use of MR in the upgrading of reformate streams follows the logic of Process Intensification Strategy, pursuing the reduction of plant size and the improvement of the process yield. In the past, palladium-alloy membranes were successfully used for hydrogen production/separation also for the WGS step (Shu et al., 1991; Lewis, 1967; Uemiya et al., 1991; Dittmeyer et al., 2001; Paglieri and Way, 2002; Seok and Hwang, 1990; Tosti et al., 2003). However, the majority of these studies proposed the use of sweep gas to promote H2 permeation and only a small part combines the use of a low feed pressure to the sweep gas for improving the permeation. The use of sweep gas produces a dilution of the H2 stream that, thus, needs a further separation step. In this work, the role of promoting H2 permeation has been assigned to the feed pressure, which allows a pure H2 stream to be obtained, not requiring a further separation steps. In particular, the upgrading of a syngas stream, with a composition similar to that coming out of the reformer (CO 45%; H2 50%; CO2 4%; N2 balance), was carried out in a Pd–Ag MR, for achieving higher CO conversion with respect to TR and a pure H2 stream, directly usable in a PEMFC."
1,Materials and methods,"The MR used consists of two concentric tubes (Fig. 2 ): the outer tube is a stainless steel shell; the inner tube is the Pd-alloy self-supported membrane. The membrane is blind and has only one exit. The characteristics of the membrane and MR are shown in Table 1 . A CuO/CeO2 commercial catalyst (Engelhard) is packed in the shell side. This configuration was demonstrated to be more efficient for the heat exchange between the reaction volume and the furnace (Marigliano et al., 2001), allowing a better catalyst exploitation. Pd-alloy membranes are generally utilised in a temperature range where the diffusion in the metal bulk is the rate determining step as in the present investigation. Therefore, Sieverts’ law (Eq. (1)) is used generally for the mathematical description of H2 permeating flux in these membranes. The hydrogen flux is a linear function of the driving force that is given by the difference of the square root of H2 partial pressure on both membrane sides. (1) H 2 permeating flux = permeance H 2 0 e - E / RT ( P H 2 reaction side - P H 2 permeate side ) The permeation membrane properties, already studied in our previous work (Barbieri et al., 2008), are reported in Table 2 . The experimental apparatus used in the reaction tests is shown in Fig. 3 . The MR was placed in a temperature controlled electric furnace (with PID control). A mass flow controller (Brooks Instrument 5850S) was used for feeding the gaseous mixture, while an HPLC pump (Dionex P680A) was used to feed the water. A heating coil was put into the furnace to vaporize the water. The flow rates of the outlet streams were measured by means of bubble soap flow-meters. The chemicals on the retentate and permeate streams were analysed by means of a gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890N) with two parallel analytical lines. Each line is equipped with two columns: an HP-Plot-5A (for separating permanent gases such as H2, N2 and CO) and an HP-Poraplot-Q (for other species) and a TCD. The temperature was measured by using a thermocouple positioned on the middle of the reactor shell. The operating conditions used in the experiments are reported in Table 3 . Wet and dry compositions are reported since the stream coming out by a reformer is generally indicated on a dry basis but WGS reaction requires also water vapour. It should be pointed out that the reaction tests were performed for around six months and during this time no changes in the membrane properties were shown. Furthermore, no carbon deposition was observed, as can be appreciated by the error bars reported in the experimental data: always lower than 5%. The reaction tests were carried out also analyzing the effect of the GHSV (gas hourly space velocity), which is a variable generally used for indicating the reverse of the residence time of reactants and catalyst. A low GHSV indicates a high residence time and, thus, favours the conversion, while the contrary applies for a high GHSV. The highest possible GHSV value is desired from an industrial point of view. CO conversion of TR and MR was calculated using the Eq. (2), including CO and CO2 present in the outlet streams. In particular, the retentate stream contains the unconverted reactants, CO2 and not permeated H2 fraction, and the H2 stream permeated through the membrane. (2) CO conversion = 1 2 [ ( F CO 2 retentate - F CO 2 feed F CO feed ) + ( 1 - F CO retentate F CO feed ) ] The conversion is calculated as the mean value of CO2 produced (lower value) and CO present in the outlet streams (upper value). The difference of the two values is the carbon balance. The upper limit of a chemical reaction is given by the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion. The equilibrium conversion of a TR (TREC) is a widely consolidated concept; the equilibrium of an MR was introduced rather recently (Barbieri et al., 2001). The permeation equilibrium has to be reached in an MR in addition to the reaction equilibrium typical of a TR. Therefore, the MR equilibrium conversion (MREC) is a function of the thermodynamic variables (e.g. T, P) and initial composition on both sides of the Pd-alloy membrane. (3) MREC = MR equilibrium conversion = f ( Kp , T reaction , P reaction , Y i feed , T permeation , P permeation , F feed / F sweep , Y i sweep ) MREC gives the maximum conversion achievable with the MR; it is independent of the membrane performance influencing the time-dependent variables (Barbieri et al., 2001) (e.g. the MR residence time) necessary to reach equilibrium, but the final value reached depends on the extractive capacity of the system. The recovery capability of the MR was quantified in this study in terms of recovery index (Barbieri et al., 2005), defined as (Eq. (4)): (4) H 2 recovery index = R I H 2 = F H 2 permeate F H 2 permeate + F H 2 retentate It is the H2 fraction permeated through the membrane with respect to the whole H2 both produced by reaction and fed to the MR. In addition, in the MR technology, the quantification of H2 recovered with respect to that totally available in the feed is an important issue. The extraction index (EI), defined as the ratio between H2 permeated through the membrane with respect to that totally fed to the reactor (Eq. (5)) gives an indication about the limitations that MR use implies for the achievement of a complete conversion: (5) Extraction index i = E I H 2 = F H 2 permeate F H 2 available in the feed = F H 2 permeate F H 2 feed + a · F CO feed a = { m per m < 1 1 per m ≥ 1 EI takes into account the hydrogen fed as H2 molecules and that is contained in the feed stream in other chemicals (e.g., H2O). The term ( a F CO feed ) of the Eq. (5) considers the maximum H2 extractable from the chemicals present in the system. The coefficient (a) takes into account the defecting reactant (CO or H2O) by means of the feed molar ratio H2O/CO. (a) is equal to the feed molar ratio if this latter is lower than 1 (CO in defect with respect to H2O). (a) will be equal 1 when the CO exceeds the H2O. As defined, EI depends on the membrane properties, feed molar ratio and CO conversion achieved in the MR, at set operating conditions. The capability of reaching a conversion higher than a TR, exceeding the TR equilibrium limits is a typical property of an MR. Moving in the logic of the new metrics of the Process Intensification Strategy, in a previous work (Brunetti et al., 2007) the conversion index (CI) was defined (Eq. (6)), as the ratio between the conversion achieved in an MR and that of a TR, for a set reaction volume. This index gives an evaluation of the gain in terms of conversion and its use is particularly indicated when the feed mixture also contains reaction products. (6) Conversion index = CI = ( conversion ) MR ( conversion ) TR | set reaction volume"
2,Results and discussion,"In a Pd–Ag MR, CO conversion is significantly promoted by the feed pressure which, even though it does not influence the reaction from a thermodynamic point of view, promotes the permeation driving force, allowing the selective H2 removal from the reaction side. This can be seen in Fig. 4 where the partial pressure profiles of each species involved in the WGS reaction when a syngas mixture is fed into the MR (Brunetti et al., 2007) are reported. H2 partial pressure profile on the reaction side rapidly decreases along the reactor owing to the effect of permeation."
3,CO conversion,"3.1 CO conversion Fig. 5 shows the improvement in CO conversion at 325°C as a function of the feed pressure. CO conversion is significantly higher than that achievable in a TR (also referring to the TREC), in the same operating conditions reaching a value of 65% (at 3200h−1 and 300kPa) to 85% (at 2600h−1 and 600kPa) much higher than TREC. CO conversion achieved at 2600h−1 is always higher than that reached at a higher GHSV (3200h−1), in the whole range of operating conditions considered. A lower GHSV implies, in fact, a higher contact time among reactants and catalyst and, thus, a higher CO conversion. Furthermore, the CO conversion curve corresponding to 2600h−1 is closer to the MREC as the feed pressure is higher, because of the combined positive effects of high residence time and favoured H2 permeation through the membrane. However, also working at the higher GHSV, the improvement in CO conversion was significant, reaching around 80% and, thus, implying significant advantages in terms of better catalyst use and the possibility of treating bigger feed streams in a lower catalyst volume reaching the same CO conversion. In the whole temperature range investigated (Fig. 6 ) the highest conversions were achieved at the highest feed pressure. At 600kPa, for both the GHSVs considered, CO conversion follows an increasing trend up to the highest value reached at 300°C, after which it slightly decreases (at 2600h−1). This trend is explained considering that even though the low temperature favours the reaction from a thermodynamic point of view, on the contrary, both the reaction kinetics and the permeation are not favoured since they follow an Arrhenius law. Therefore, CO conversion increases with temperature up to 300°C; after a maximum, CO conversion is depleted, with the thermodynamics constraint becoming relevant. In all cases, CO conversion obtained in an MR, reaching e.g. 90% at 300°C and 2600h−1, is significantly higher than the TR one."
4,Hydrogen recovery index,"3.2 Hydrogen recovery index A high CO conversion means, in other words, a high H2 production or, rather, a high H2 partial pressure on the reaction side. This is traduced in a high permeation driving force and, thus, in more H2 recovered in the permeate. The recovery index (Eq. (4)) indicating H2 fraction recovered, follows a linear dependence on the Sieverts driving force (Fig. 7 ), in the whole temperature range. Furthermore, at the same GHSV, RI increases with temperature, the kinetic and the permeation being favoured. In particular, H2 RI is always higher at 2600h−1, due to the higher CO conversion with respect to the case at 3200h−1. In a previous work Wadhwani et al. (2002) a relationship taking into account the CO inhibition effect on H2 permeation and, thus, on the hydrogen recovery index was identified. CO concentration is a function of the progress of the reaction. The reaction affects hydrogen production and, hence, its partial pressure. GHSV can be considered to indicate indirectly the reaction extent or better (specifically) the hydrogen production: a higher GHSV value means lower conversion and H2 production and vice versa. Therefore, the following Eq. (7) was obtained to represent the RI lines at all the GHSVs (Barbieri et al., 2008). (7) RI = k · GHSV GHSV 0 · 1 α Δ P H 2 It considers any increase/decrease of GHSV with respect to reference values GHSV0 (2600h−1) and the permeance reduction owing to CO hindrance. The terms α in the Eq. (7) estimates the effect of unconverted CO present in the MR on H2 permeance with respect to the H2 permeance of a pure H2 feed stream (Barbieri et al., 2008). The proportional factor, k, has to be evaluated at each temperature. It does not have a regular dependence on the temperature because the reaction approaches the chemical equilibrium at the highest temperature. (8) H 2 permeance reduction = α = 1 - ( permeance ) H 2 during reaction ( permeance ) H 2 permeation tests , Fig. 8 shows this correlation for the three temperatures of Fig. 7. There is a good agreement between the experimental data and the regression lines through the origin. Therefore, Eq. (7) well represents H2 RI as a function of the GHSV, feed pressure, etc. at any investigated temperature. The best results in terms of RI were reached at 325°C and 600kPa for GHSV=2600h−1, recovering up to 80% of the total H2 produced (Fig. 9 ). However, also at 3200h−1 the MR allows 75% of H2 produced to be recovered. This is a very important result, indicating the possibility of processing a higher feed flow rate with the same catalyst amount, achieving, however, a good H2 recovery. It is very important to observe the effect of the feed pressure on RI at all the investigated temperatures. RI becomes 3–4 times higher when the feed pressure ranges from 300 to 600kPa, owing to the promotion of the permeation that improves CO conversion much more and thus the hydrogen production."
5,Hydrogen extraction index,"3.3 Hydrogen extraction index In the evaluation of the extractive capability of the MR, it is important to compare the H2 amount permeated with that stoichiometrically extractable by the reactants. The EI (Eq. (5)) gives this information as the ratio between H2 permeated with respect to maximum H2 extractable. EI (Fig. 10 ) shows an increasing trend as a function of temperature, similar to that of RI, even though always lower owing to the incomplete conversion, in all the cases. However, higher EI is achieved at the highest temperature and feed pressure both favouring the permeation, at all the GHSVs considered and reaches 75% at 2600h−1. This means that the MR has a significant extractive capability and, thus, assures a good exploitation of the reactants."
6,Conversion index,"3.4 Conversion index To have an immediate idea of this advantage in the use of an MR with respect to a TR, the conversion index (Eq. (6)), can be used, particularly when the feed mixture also contains products apart from reactants. It compares the conversions obtained by an MR and a TR, working in the same operating conditions, on the same catalyst volume. Considering, for instance, the case at 325°C, the CI shows an increasing trend with the feed pressure, ranging from 3 to 5 (Fig. 11 ). This means that, with the same reaction volume, CO conversion achieved in the MR is 3 to 5 times higher than that of the TR. CI is favoured by a high feed pressure that improves the product formation. Furthermore, it is higher at the higher GHSV, the more relevant improvement in CO conversion being offered by an MR with respect to that of a TR, in the same operating conditions. This fact emphasizes the advantages offered by the MR use: a significantly higher CO conversion than that achievable in TR is obtained in all cases, thus, a larger amount of feed stream can be treated with the same catalyst volume, reaching CO conversion 3–5 times higher than that of the TR. In the whole temperature range considered, the CI trend is similar to that shown at 325°C: even if CO conversion of both MR and TR are lower, their ratio is quite the same (Fig. 12 )."
7,Conclusions,"A syngas mixture was upgraded in one-stage using a Pd–Ag membrane (60μm thick) by means of water gas shift (WGS) reaction. The thermodynamics and the furthermore limitation due to the H2 presence (50%) in the feed stream did not limited WGS reaction in the MR: the measured CO conversion of 90% was 3–4 times higher than that of a TR, greatly exceeding the equilibrium conversion of a TR (36%). The MR performance was evaluated in terms of CO conversion, H2 recovery, etc. for the water gas shift reaction, using a Pd–Ag membrane 60 micrometers, operating at 280–320°C and up to 600kPa. No sweep gas was used to promote the permeation but only the pressure difference between the two membrane sides. Therefore, pure H2 was obtained as permeate stream. The MR showed satisfactory performance also at a higher GHSV, achieving a CO conversion at least three times higher than TR. This means the possibility of processing a higher feed flow rate with the same catalyst volume, obtaining, in any case, a high CO conversion and good H2 recovery. The improvement of CO conversion and hydrogen recovery was more relevant at a higher feed pressure, which being responsible for the driving force promoting H2 permeation, showed two significant effects on the system: the first, 80% of H2 stream is recovered as pure on the permeate side; the second, the retentate stream is already compressed and rich in CO2 which can be more easily captured. In particular, H2 recovery index (at each temperature) is a linear function of the permeation driving force, and permeance in the actual condition and space velocity. It increases with the permeation driving force, H2 permeance and conversion (owing to the higher H2 production) but decreases with space velocity. Further increases of CO conversion and, as a consequence, hydrogen recovery are expected working at higher feed pressure."
