0,Introduction,"Photocatalytic water splitting into H2 is considered as ideal candidate addressing energy- and environment-related issues. Thus, how to achieve efficient conversion of solar energy to hydrogen energy has become a topic of research [1–4]. When the catalyst is photoexcited, the resulting electron-hole pairs will be separated and transferred to the surface of the material for the redox reaction [5–7]. However, due to the rapid recombination of electron hole pairs and sluggish reaction kinetics, a very small number of electron hole pairs can be utilized, resulting in very low photocatalytic activity [8–11]. Thus, low charge separation efficiency is still the main factor limiting photocatalytic activity [12]. The key to solve this problem is to design and develop catalysts for new structures and constitution with efficient electron-hole transfer capability. Designing a photocatalyst based on semiconductor heterostructure can realize the effective separation of photogenerated carriers and the reduction of Gibbs free energy, which is of great significance to enhance the photocatalytic H2 release [13]. Although the construction of heterojunction can theoretically promote the electron transfer, the solid-solid interface contact problem seriously affects the electron transfer between components, which seriously hinders the actual efficiency of semiconductor heterojunction [14]. It is an effective strategy to improve the contact state of different components to construct a high-quality interface with strong mutual influence, which can accelerate the separation of carriers [15,16]. However, the interfaces currently synthesized only form point-to-point bonding between substances, which allows photoexcited carriers to move along the material from the inside to the outside, extending the carrier transfer path [17]. Thus, if a compact heterogeneous interface is formed on the basis of a large area of contact, forming an ""electron welcome zone"", providing a continuous channel for electron transport, it will exhibit the shortest carrier diffusion path, which is essential for the separation and transfer of photogenerated electron-hole pairs within the material and at the interface. To promote the separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs and improve their photocatalytic performance, many methods have been developed [18–20]. Constructing a built-in electric field at the interface of the heterojunction was considered to be the most effective way to further achieve photoelectron-hole pair separation because the presence of the built-in electric field can provide a driving force for charge directional separation [21,22]. In recent years, an interesting design strategy, the P-N junction heterostructure has been proven to be an effective strategy for separating electrons and holes. When an n-type semiconductor contacts with a p-type semiconductor to form a P-N heterojunction, electrons flow from the n-type semiconductor to the p-type semiconductor to align the Fermi levels of the two semiconductors, forming an internal electric field at the material interface. For example, Cui et al. prepared p-n homogenous perovskite for application in solar cells, and the built-in electric field generated can promote the directional transmission of photo-generated carriers, thus reducing the recombination efficiency of carriers and improving the efficiency of solar cells [23]. Successful cases have shown that introducing a built-in electric field into a material with an ordered structure will be a promising approach. In the formation of semiconductor heterojunction, the contact between components is usually chaotic, which results in random electron-hole transfer, and eventually leads to a relatively fast recombination of electrons and holes. At present, it has been found that the co-catalyst, loaded on the semiconductor in a spatially distributed state, can transfer electron-hole pairs directionally for reduction and oxidation reactions, respectively. Although this design can effectively improve the photocatalytic efficiency, the application of precious metals and the complex process of hard template etching seriously hinder the development of catalysts [24–27]. More importantly, the supported reduction and oxidation catalysts only had the ability to receive electrons and holes, and the catalyst still lacks the power to drive the electron-hole pair separation, so there is no amazing effect. Understanding from the above analysis, we demonstrate a sequential ion-substitution method to synthesize a new class of sequential heterojunction of hollow dodecahedron CoS/CdS/CuS with built-in electric field with rich and compact hetero-interfaces: (1) with Co metal-organic framework (ZIF-67) as a precursor, hollow CoS dodecahedra were firstly synthesized through sulfurizing ZIF-67 with thiourea; (2) with hollow CoS dodecahedra as a template, hollow CoS/CdS/CuS dodecahedra were synthesized through sequential K sp-based cation substitution, producing two large contact interfaces between CoS and CdS, CdS and CuS. The unique sequence structure constructed the in-situ ""electron welcome zone"", which provides a continuous channel for electron transfer and ensures a wide and short electron diffusion path, and forms the directional movement of electrons under the action of the internal electric field. In addition, the existence of CoS can reduce the Gibbs free energy of the reaction via theoretical calculation. With as-formed hollow CoS/CdS/CuS dodecahedra as a photocatalyst and lactic acid as a hole scavenger for water splitting to H2, H2 evolution rate was up to 123.2 mmol h−1 g−1 with an impressive apparent quantum efficiency of 45.6%. Such a H2 evolution rate was among the highest values of CdS-based photocatalyst. This novel ""electronic welcome zone"" design provides a promising strategy for efficient electron transfer engineering in photochemistry."

7,Synthesis and characterization of triple-shelled CoS/CdS/CuS hollow dodecahedra,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization of triple-shelled CoS/CdS/CuS hollow dodecahedra The synthetic procedures for constructing the triple-shelled CoS/CdS/CuS hollow dodecahedra were composed of three steps as shown in Fig. 1. Firstly, with Co2+ (as a metal ion) and 2-methylimidazole (as a linker), zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-67) were initially synthesized (Fig. S1) [28]. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image observed solid dodecahedral nanostructures with side length ca 0.400 nm ( Fig. 2a and e). Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detected Co, N and C (Fig. 1i). Subsequently, through sulfurizing ZIF-67 with thioacetamide (TAA) in ethanol at 120 °C for 4 h, the sulfurized product still adapted dodecahedral morphology (Fig. 2b), and switched to hollow dodecahedra (Fig. 2f). The magnified TEM image observed that ca. 4 nm nanoparticles located on the surfaces (Fig. S2). EDS detected Co and S, but not N and C (Fig. 2j). Through XRD, as shown in Fig. S2, it can be seen that the cleanliness of cobalt sulfide was relatively low and there was no diffraction peak. Inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurements revealed the molar ratio of Co: S was 1:1.01. Moreover, the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image observed lattice fringes of 0.292 nm (assigned to (1 0 0) crystal plane of CoS [29]) (Fig. S3). The results indicated that solid ZIF-67 was sulfurized to hollow CoS. The sulfurized process was a diffusion-controlled anion exchange process [30]: (1) S2- released from the decomposed TAA, diffused into ZIF-67 surface and further reacted with Co2+ forming a thin layer of CoS, which hindered further reaction of outside S2− with inner Co2+; (2) the gradually outward diffusion of Co2+ (smaller size) was dominant compared to the inward diffusion of S2−; (3) the continuous dissolution of ZIF-67 cores and deposition of CoS on the shells produced hollow CoS dodecahedral nanostructures. The specific surface area (with the mean size of pores about 2.5 nm) was evaluated to be 136 m2 g−1 (Fig. S4). As a continue, as-formed hollow CoS was treated with Cd2+ in ethylene glycol at 180 °C for 3 h. The product still adapted hollow dodecahedral nanostructures with roughed surfaces (Figs. 2c, g and S5). EDS detected Cd, Co and S (Fig. 2k). The diffraction peak of CdS can be seen by XRD (Fig. S2), which proved that CdS was generated. Inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurements revealed the molar ratio of Co: Cd: S was 0.13: 0.87: 1. Moreover, HRTEM image detected a newly appeared lattice fringes of 0.357 nm (assigned to the (1 0 0) crystal plane of CdS [31]) with the lattice fringe of 0.292 nm remained (Fig. S5). The results showed that 87% CoS converted into CdS. Due to the fact that K sp of CdS was much smaller than that of CoS [32]: (1) Cd2+ in ethylene glycol (η = 19 cP) firstly contacted with hollow CoS surface, substituted Co2+ from CoS with converting into CdS, (2) with the reaction proceeding, Cd2+ slowly permeated into the inner layer of CoS, (3) the inwardly diffused Cd2+ further substituted Co2+ with CoS switching to CdS. Thus, hollow CoS/CdS dodecahedra with inner layer of CoS and outer layer of CdS were synthesized. As expected, upon varying reaction time from 0 to 3 h, the content of Cd2+ gradually enhanced, and Co2+ accordingly decreased (Table S1). Alternatively, if ethylene glycol was replaced by water (η = 1 cP), the hollow dodecahedral nanostructures were completely destroyed (Fig. S6), proving that the viscosity of solvent plays an important role in the synthesis of materials. Moreover, it was proposed that the K sp-based cation substitution was a diffusion-controlled process. According to the same procedure, the cation exchange was further implemented through as-formed CoS/CdS reacting with Cu2+ in ethylene glycol at room temperature for 1.5 h. The final product also adapted hollow dodecahedral morphology with further roughed surfaces (Figs. 2d, h and S7). There was no peak of copper sulfide detected by XRD (Fig. S2), which may be the reason for the low content. EDS detected Cu, Cd, Co and S ( Fig. 3l) and ICP-MS revealed the molar ratio of Co: Cd: Cu: S was 0.13: 0.77: 0.10: 1. HRTEM image displayed a clear and newly appeared lattice fringe of 0.301 nm (102 crystal plane of CuS) (Fig. 3a) [33]. Interestingly, the lattice fringes of 0.292 nm (CoS) and 0.357 nm (CdS) were still kept. The results demonstrated: (1) inner side of CoS was not disturbed by Cu2+, (2) Cu2+ substituted 11% (0.10/0.87) Cd2+ in CdS with CdS partially converting into CuS. As a result, hollow CdS dodecahedrons with spatially separated CoS (inner layer) and CuS (CoS/CdS/CuS) was synthesized, which was further confirmed by the elemental mapping images (Fig. 3b). Thus, two interfaces (CoS/CdS and CdS/CuS) were formed through cation diffusion and K sp-based cation substitution. In addition, the interfaces appeared in CoS/CdS/CuS were clearly identify. A STEM (scanning transmission electron microscopy)-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy line scan was performed through an individual CoS/CdS/CuS dodecahedron as shown in Fig. 3c. As shown in Fig. 3d. The results show that there was no obvious boundary between CuS and CdS, and between CdS and CoS, showing a large area of interface contact [34,35], which was conducive to electron transmission and forms two large ""electron welcome zone"". Compared with the interface contact of the traditional point-to-point contact, the ""electron welcome zone"" provides a continuous channel for electron transport, ensures a wide and short electron diffusion path, and facilitates the separation of photogenerated carriers in the semiconductor heterojunction. In addition, most of the CoS existed in the inner layer, which was conducive to the directional movement of electrons and improved the separation efficiency of photo-generated carriers [36]. In order to further study the composition of samples, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to study the element composition of CoS/CdS/CuS. The test results were shown in Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 4a, in addition to the peaks of element Cd and element S, two peaks of element Co and Cu can be clearly observed, which was consistent with the result of element mapping. The spectra of Cd 3d shown two peaks at 405.2 and 411.9 eV, as shown in Fig. 4b, corresponding to Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2, respectively. Fig. 4c shown the Co 2p spectrum. Four peaks appeared in the Co 2p spectrum. Peaks at 781.4 and 797.3 eV can be attributed to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 of the Co2+. The other two peaks at 785.9 and 802.5 eV were the two satellite peaks. The spectra of Cu 2p show two peaks at 931.7 and 951.6 eV, as shown in Fig. 4d, corresponding to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 respectively. The spectra of S 2p were divided into two peaks, and their binding energies were 161.6 eV and 162.6 eV respectively (Fig. 4e), corresponding to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 respectively, indicating the existence of S2- in the sample. The XPS results further demonstrated that all three substances coexist in the product."
8,Performance in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"3.2 Performance in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution Based on the discussion above, the synthesized CoS/CdS/CuS hollow dodecahedra structures with ""electron welcome zone"" as photocatalysts were applied for water splitting to H2 under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). Upon light irradiation on CoS/CdS/CuS, a steady accumulation of H2 (within 4 h) was observed as shown in Fig. 5a. The H2 evolution rate was evaluated to be 123.2 mmol g−1 h−1 (Fig. 5b), which was the highest value among CdS-based photocatalysts without noble metal involved ( Table 1). There was an impressive apparent quantum efficiency of 45.6% at 420 nm. The evolution of plentiful bubbles commenced as soon as irradiated by the light source can be clearly seen from the Video S1. As a comparison, CoS, CdS, CdS-Pt and CoS/CdS were applied as photo-catalysts, respectively (Fig. 5a), the corresponding H2 evolution rate were 0, 1.7, 31.4 and 35.2 mmol g−1 h−1 (Fig. 5b). CoS did not exhibit photocatalytic H2 production because it was only used as a co-catalyst. CdS shown a low performance of photocatalytic H2 production, with only 1.7 mmol g −1 h−1. This was because the photoelectron-hole separation efficiency of individual CdS was low, and most of them recombine before taking part in the reaction. When CdS was supported with Pt as a co-catalyst, the hydrogen production of 31.4 mmol g−1 h−1 was demonstrated. However, compared with the production of CoS/CdS-3/CuS-1.5, Pt as a co-catalyst produces only one-third of the hydrogen production of CoS/CdS-3/CuS-1.5. For CoS/CdS-3 catalyst, the hydrogen production efficiency reached 35.2 mmol g−1 h−1, which was much higher than CdS alone and superior to CdS-Pt, proving that CoS was an excellent co-catalyst. Supplementary material related to this article can be found online at doi:10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120763. The following is the Supplementary material related to this article Video S1. Video S1 . In order to prove the function of CoS, theoretical calculation was carried out. The hydrogen adsorption free energy ΔGH* had been used as an index to evaluate the hydrogen evolution reactivity of catalysts [50,51]. Density functional theory (DFT) was used to calculate the Gibbs free energy (ΔGH*) and evaluate the potential of CoS as a co-catalyst for hydrogen evolution (see the Methods section in the Supporting Information). The adsorption diagram of H on the CdS/CoS model was shown in Fig. 5c. The calculated results shown that the ΔGH* (0.12) value of the CdS/CoS heterostructure was close to zero compared with the pure CdS (0.97) value and CoS (0.45) value (the adsorption diagram of H on the model was shown in Fig. S8), which was similar to that of Pt (−0.10), indicating that the prepared heterostructure had good catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution, as shown in Fig. 5d. In the experiment, the hydrogen production activity of CdS/CoS was higher than that of CdS-Pt, which may be due to the existence of ""electron welcome zone"" in CdS and CoS, which was favorable to the separation of photogenic carriers. In addition, compared with CoS/CdS-3 catalyst, the catalytic activity of CoS/CdS-3/CuS-1.5 was significantly improved. Such a high H2 evolution rate was possibly due to highly efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs produced in CoS/CdS-3/CuS-1.5. In order to explore the source of the excellent photocatalytic performance of ternary compounds, optical and photoelectric tests were carried out. It can be seen from the UV–vis DRS that the addition of CoS and CuS can greatly improve the light absorption capacity of the material, as shown in Fig. S9a. Excellent light absorption capacity was the basis of photocatalytic performance. In order to clarify the role of CoS and CuS, we conducted in-depth electrochemical research and studied the energy band structure of materials. It can be seen from Mott-Schottky point that the CdS was an n-type semiconductor. This flat band potential corresponds to the Fermi level of the material, for the Fermi level of the n-type material near the conduction band of the material [52]. As shown in Fig. S10a, the leading band position of CdS was −0.94 V versus Ag/AgCl, corresponding to −0.37 V versus NHE [53]. For CoS, there's a positive flat potential here, showing that electrons can be transferred from CdS to CoS [54]. Therefore, when CdS and CoS formed heterojunctions, the hydrogen production performance of the composite increases significantly. For CuS, it can be seen from the flat band potential test that CuS was a p-type semiconductor (Fig. S10b). For the Fermi level of p-type semiconductor was close to the valence band of material. The valence band of CuS was 0.61 V versus Ag/AgCl, corresponding to 1.17 V versus NHE. According to literature reported, when the p-n junction was formed, the Fermi energy level of the two would be leveled, thus creating an internal electric field at the interface between the two [52]. The presence of built-in electric field could greatly promote the separation of photoelectron-hole pairs, thus greatly enhancing the photocatalytic activity. According to the light absorption properties of materials, CdS and CuS can be obtained with bandgap width of 2.14 and 1.29 eV (Fig. S9b). The detailed band structure can be obtained as shown in Fig. 5e. After the p-n junction was formed, the new band structure of the two can be obtained due to the flattening of the Fermi energy level, as shown in Fig. 5f. The photocatalytic stability was examined through repeating the experiment five times ( Fig. 6a, black line), and even after six months (Fig. 6a, red line), exhibiting almost the same H2 evolution activity. After the formation of p-n junction, the holes generated in the valence band of CdS would quickly transfer to the valence band of CuS, thus inhibiting the photo-corrosion of CdS and providing high stability. In addition, after cyclic illumination test, the hollow structure of CoS/CdS/CuS had not changed significantly (Fig. S11), which further confirmed the excellent optical stability of CoS/CdS/CuS. In order to further study the source of ultra-high activity of CoS/CdS/CuS (representing CoS/CdS-3/CuS-1.5), we conducted a more detailed study, and observed different hydrogen-producing activities by synthesizing materials with different interfaces, as shown in Fig. 6. As a comparison, CoS-CdS/CuS and CoS-CdS-CuS with different interfaces (“/” standing for large interface; “-” standing for less interface) were synthesized and further applied for water splitting into H2 (Fig. 6a). The corresponding H2 evolution rates were 47.2 and 9.4 mmol g−1 h−1, respectively (Fig. 6b). When the interface between CdS and CuS becomes the “electron-welcome zone”, the hydrogen production activity of the contact interface material was increased by 5.02 times compared with the point-to-point interfacial contact material (CoS-CdS-CuS). On the other hand, when the interface between CdS and CoS became “electron-welcome zone”, the hydrogen production activity of CoS/CdS/CuS increased by 13.1 times, indicating that the construction of the ""electron-welcome zone"" ensured a wide and short electron diffusion path, provided a continuous channel for electron transport, and promoted the separation of photogenerated carriers in the semiconductor heterojunction. In order to study the effects of different interfaces on photogenerated carriers, photochemical (PEC) experiments were performed. Fig. 6d depicts the EIS Nyquist diagrams of electrodes with different interface materials. In the EIS Nyquist diagram, the arc radius of CoS/CdS/CuS electrode decreases obviously, indicating that the formation of ""electron-welcome zone"" at the material interface can reduce the electron migration resistance at the material interface [55]. At the same time, fluorescence emission spectroscopy (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy test showed that, as shown in Fig. 6e and f, the fluorescence intensity of CoS/CdS/CuS was significantly reduced and the electron life was significantly enhanced (Table S2). Thus, when the interface changes from point-to-point connection to ""electron-welcome zone"", which was beneficial to the separation of photoelectric hole pairs [56]. Based on the above research and analysis, a schematic of the proposed charge transfer for CoS/CdS/CuS was proposed, as shown in Fig. 7. In the experiment, p-CuS and n-CdS can form p-n junction, and a built - in electric field (ɛ) would form at the interface, which can transfer the hole of the valence band of CdS to the valence band of CuS, and react with sacrificial agent and be consumed. The electrons in the conduction band were rapidly transferred to the conduction band of CdS, and the electrons were transferred to the CoS through the conduction action of CoS, which reacted with H+ to generate H2. Moreover, the material prepared by continuous ion exchange had a large contact interface and can form ""electron-welcome zone"", which was more advantageous to the separation of photocarriers. The ""electron-welcome zone"" could shorten the electron transfer distance and further improved the separation efficiency of photo-generated electron-hole pairs. More importantly, the presence of the electron welcome zone can increase the area of the built - in electric field and promote the separation of photogenerated carriers. Therefore, the super-strong photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst prepared in this experiment was due to the following three factors: (1) the existence of the built-in electric field (ɛ) formed by p-n junction; (2) The construction of ""electron-welcome zone"" increased the area of the built - in electric field and promoted the separation of photogenerated electron-hole. (3) the existence of CoS can reduce the Gibbs free energy of the photocatalytic hydrogen production by theoretical calculation."
9,Conclusion,"In summary, sequential heterostructure of hollow dodecahedron CoS/CdS/CuS were synthesized in this study through a sequential K sp-based cation substitution, producing two “electron-welcome zone”. Due to the electron trapping effect of co-catalyst (CoS) and the presence of the internal electric field established at the interface between p-n junction, the efficiency of charge directional separation and hydrogen-generation kinetics can be greatly improved. The synthesized CoS/CdS/CuS hollow dodecahedra as photocatalysts exhibited a superior and stable photocatalytic H2 evolution rate (123.2 mmol h−1 g−1). There was an impressive apparent quantum efficiency of 45.6% at 420 nm and the visible bubbles of hydrogen gas were clearly observed. This developed strategy could be further extended for synthesizing other highly efficient sequential catalysts with “electron-welcome zone” and built-in electric field for solar energy conversion."
