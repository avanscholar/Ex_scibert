0,Introduction,"Ammonia represents a potential COx-free (x = 1,2) and high-density source of hydrogen fuel that benefits from a well-developed synthesis and distribution technology [1–4]. However, the decomposition of ammonia into hydrogen remains challenging in the absence of high-performance catalysts under mild conditions [2]. For example, catalysts based on Ru, Ni, and Mo have aided the decomposition of gaseous ammonia to produce hydrogen, albeit at high temperatures (>400 °C) [5–9]. Alternatively, 3d-orbital transition metal nitrides have exhibited high activity for the electrolysis of gaseous ammonia at lower temperatures but required a supporting electrolyte [10–14]. Moreover, amides (LiNH2, NaNH2, KNH2, N,N-dimethylformamide, etc), used as supporting electrolytes, have facilitated the electrolysis of liquid ammonia at extremely cold temperatures ranging between −70 and −65 °C using pure platinum electrodes [15,16]. The electro-oxidation of aqueous ammonia into hydrogen at ambient temperature and pressure is considered feasible and attractive because of the favourable thermodynamics over the electrolysis of water [17,18]. Various materials, including noble metals, metal oxides, and non-metals, have shown high activity for this reaction [19–25]. Specifically, Pt has provided the most effective ammonia electrocatalyst to date. However, most ammonia electro-oxidation systems require strong alkaline media (for example in NaOH), which causes the rapid deactivation and poisoning of Pt catalysts, oxygen evolution, and production of NOx. Electrodeposited Pt electrodes [19] and nanotubes [20] have easily oxidized ammonia into hydrogen under strongly alkaline conditions. Moreover, SnO2-modified Pt/C has electrolyzed aqueous ammonia into hydrogen in high concentration alkaline solutions [21]. Pt/Ir on multi-walled carbon nanotubes has recently produced hydrogen from ammonia in the dilute alkaline solution [22]. However, oxygen evolution, NOx detection, and electrode stability information were not given. As an alternative, a graphite electrode has displayed enhanced activity for ammonia oxidation only if chloride is present in the reaction system [23]. Thermally decomposed iridium oxide films have also proven catalytically active for direct aqueous ammonia oxidation in the absence of pH control or adjustment [24]. However, oxygen evolution and elemental nitrogen adsorption deactivate IrO2 in these native pH solutions. Tin oxide-based materials have attracted significant research interest in widespread applications such as gas sensor materials, oxidation catalysts, and transparent conductors [26]. Tin oxides (SnOx), and especially spherical tin dioxide (SnO2, 110), can interact with NH3 molecules by covalent adsorption [27,28]. In particular, the four-coordinate Sn2+ cations at the bridging oxygen vacancies of oxygen-deficient SnO2 (1 1 0) surfaces were “more acidic” than their five-coordinate Sn4+ counterparts, consistent with covalent bonding between NH3 and Sn(II) upon adsorption [28]. However, in most cases, NH3 was decomposed by single SnOx to N2 and H2O instead of hydrogen [27]. Moreover, hydrogen adsorption and desorption were not observed by thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS), indicating that the single SnOx didn’t have the ability to oxidize ammonia to produce hydrogen [28]. On the other hand, the compared study of hydrogen activation indicated that Pt(1 1 1)SnOx had more spillover hydrogen than the single Pt(1 1 1) [29–31]. Therefore, the synthesis of high-performance SnOx electrocatalysts containing Pt(1 1 1), which has a stronger resistance to potential OH− poisoning, could be the key to hydrogen production from aqueous ammonia under native pH conditions. Herein, the Pt-(SnOx:Sb)/Ti electrocatalyst (PSTE) was synthesized by a simple layer-by-layer method. The electrocatalyst displayed high stability and activity for aqueous ammonia decomposition for the production of hydrogen under native pH conditions. Meanwhile, NOx molecules were not detected during the electrolysis. Experimental physicochemical characterizations demonstrated that the PSTE was a tri-functionalised electrocatalyst featuring the ammonia adsorption function of SnOx, hydrogen transfer function of SnOH and hydrogen spillover function of Pt. The proposed mechanism could guide the synthesis of future high-performance electrocatalysts for hydrogen production from aqueous ammonia, ammonia-containing wastewater, hydrazine, and organic amines."
1,Experimental section,
2,Instruments and reagents,"2.1 Instruments and reagents All chemicals were of analytic or guaranteed grade and supplied by Adamas Reagent Co., Ltd. The PtSnOx(Sb-doped)/Ti electrocatalyst (PSTE) was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL7800F), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, IRPrestige-21, SHIMADAZU), X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku RAD-C), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi electron spectrometer). The activity and stability of the PSTE were measured by an electrochemical work station (CHI660E Chenhua). The NOx generation was determined according to standard methods (Federation W. E. American Public Health Association. Standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater. American Public Health Association (APHA): Washington, DC, USA, 2005)."
3,Synthesis of the PtSnOx based electrocatalyst,"2.2 Synthesis of the PtSnOx based electrocatalyst 2.2.1 Titanium surface treatment A commercial titanium plate (Ti, purchased, >99.9%, 1 mm thickness, 10 mm × 10 mm with a 120 mm tail) was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with a 1.0 mol/L NaOH solution. The washed matrix was pretreated by sandpaper (120, 250 and 400 meshes) to remove oxides, increase the roughness and grind a smooth edge. The pretreated matrix was then heated at 80 °C for 2 h in a saturated oxalic acid solution to form cavities on the surface. 2.2.2 Preparation of (SnOx:Sb)/Ti Concentrated hydrochloric acid (12.0 mol/L)-dissolved Sb2O3 was mixed with an alcohol mixture that consisted of stannous chloride (Sn:Sb = 67:1, mol/mol), ethanol, butanol, isobutanol and ethylene glycol (25:10:12.5:1.5, vol/vol) to obtain the precursor. The treated Ti matrix was immersed in the precursor for 5 min at 40 °C and baked for 30 min at 145 °C. This process was repeated five times. Next, the substrate was calcined for 5 h at 600 °C to form a conductive layer. 2.2.3 Preparation of Pt-(SnOx:Sb)/Ti Modified acrylate was dropped into a mixture composed of H2PtCl6·6H2O (0.1 g) dissolved in concentrated hydrochloric acid (0.5 mL, 12 mol/L) and mixed alcohols (1.0 mL, polyethylene glycol (PEG(800)):ethanol = 40:56, m/m) to form a film. The film was applied four times to the surface of SnOx:Sb/Ti and baked for 10 min at 145 °C. After the fourth film covered SnOx:Sb-doped)/Ti, it was calcined for 1 h at 600 °C to form the electrocatalyst. The electrocatalyst was described as the PtSnOx based electrocatalyst (PSTE)."
4,Evaluation of the electrochemical performance of the PSTE,"2.3 Evaluation of the electrochemical performance of the PSTE Typically, the decomposition of aqueous ammonia was studied under alkaline conditions at 40 °C. The ammonia solution was prepared by adding ammonia spirit (15 mol/L, 1.0 mL) into 70 mL NaOH solution (1.0 mol/L). Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed between −1.50 and 2.50 V at a sweep rate of 50 mV·s−1. The PSTE and Hg/HgO were paired to provide the counter, working and reference electrodes (10 mm × 10 mm). To eliminate edge effects, the edge was sealed with epoxy resin. Only one side of the PSTE was used so that the current data equaled the current density. Under native pH conditions, except the NaOH solution was replaced by deionized water, the other settings were not changed."
5,Determination of total nitrogen oxides,"2.4 Determination of total nitrogen oxides The routine examination of NO2 N and NO3 N in the reaction system was performed using an ion chromatograph equipped with a SH-AC-1 anion exchange column (ICI-100, ShengHan). The flow rate of the mobile phase, which was composed of 3.6 mmol/L sodium carbonate and 4.5 mmol/L sodium hydrogen carbonate, was fixed at 1.5 mL/min at 30 °C. The mobile phase and all samples were filtered to avoid blocking the column."
6,Result and discussions,
7,The physicochemical characteristics of the PSTE,"3.1 The physicochemical characteristics of the PSTE Surface morphologies of the PSTE and its precursor (SnOx:Sb)/Ti were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figs. 1 and S1 (see Supporting Information)). Surface oxides formed nearly spherical SnOx particles upon conversion into the PSTE, indicating which has the higher performance for ammonia adsorption in the prepared electrocatalyst [32]. Concurrently, the Sb-doped SnOx particles shrank from 1 to 2 μm (Fig. S1(a)) to approximately 50 nm (Fig. S1(b)) but without avoiding agglomeration. The formation mechanism of the spherical PSTE particles was proposed in Fig. 1 . First, the H2PtCl6-containing modified acrylate adhesive film was anchored to the (SnOx:Sb)/Ti surface. Next, the carboxyl group of the acrylate coordinated with the Sb-doped SnOx surface oxides to form a metal-organic complex. Finally, the organic template was removed by calcination to form the PSTE. The FT-IR spectra of the PSTE showed that the material mainly consisted of SnOx (Fig. S2). Specifically, the absorption band at 636 cm−1 suggested that SnOH groups were partly converted to highly crystallized SnOx by oxo-bridge formation [33,34]. A band assigned to SnOH was observed at 550 cm−1, indicative of the existence of SnO in the PSTE [33,34]. The bands at 1626 and 3433 cm−1 revealed the presence of OH and/or NH groups on the PSTE. The NH group possibly came from the modified acrylate adhesive, which connected with Sn to form the SnNH linkage. This hypothesis was verified by the absorption band at 3774 cm−1. Moreover, the absorption at 2382 cm−1 indicated that hydrogen was adsorbed on Pt. All data proved that SnNH…Pt and/or SnOH…Pt coexisted on the PSTE. The PSTE structure was further investigated by XRD (Fig. S3). The XRD patterns featured four peaks at (1 1 0), (1 0 1), (2 1 1), and (3 0 1) for SnOx as well as four peaks at (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), and (3 1 1) for Pt. These revealed that both SnOx and Pt adopt a polycrystalline structure. Previous reports have shown that ammonia and hydrogen are adsorbed on SnOx (1 1 0) and Pt (1 1 1), respectively [26]. Hydrogen is more readily adsorbed and activated on the Pt(1 1 1)SnOx catalyst than its Pt analogues [29–31,35–37]. Therefore, the PSTE could be a high-performance electrocatalyst for the selective oxidation of the NH bond. Fig. 2 displays the XPS spectra of Sn and Pt on the PSTE. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of Sn shows two binding energies at 485.7 eV and 494.2 eV (Fig. 2(a)), corresponding to Sn2+ [38], which interacts more easily with NH3 than Sn4+ [28]. The peaks at 487.1 eV and 495.5 eV were assigned to Sn4+ [39], which represents a shift of 0.8 eV from Sn 3d5/2 (486.3 eV) and 3d3/2 peaks (494.7 eV) [37]. Changing of the binding energy was consistent with SnOPt covalent bond formation [30]. Moreover, the peak at 497.2 eV was assigned to Snδ+ [29]. Fig. 2 (b) shows two different valence states for Pt. Binding energies for the Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 doublets were detected at 71.3 eV and 74.6 eV, respectively, which corresponded to Pt0. Two additional peaks at 72.7 eV and 76.0 eV were assigned to Pt2+, which indicated the formation of Pt(1 1 1)O band [40,41]. Furthermore, three binding energies were detected at 533.5 eV, 532.1 eV, and 530.6 eV in the XPS spectrum of O 1s (Fig. S4). The peak at 533.5 eV was attributed to the antimony oxide, which increased the electrical conductivity of the electrocatalyst [42]. The main O 1s peak was observed at 530.6 eV, which may be due to the formation of the PtO and SnO bonds on the surface of the PSTE. Overall, these data proved that SnO and Pt(1 1 1)SnOx were present in the PSTE."
8,Ammonia electro-oxidation under alkaline conditions,"3.2 Ammonia electro-oxidation under alkaline conditions To test the performance of the PSTE, the ammonia electro-oxidation was carried out under alkaline conditions. Cyclic voltammograms (Fig. 3 ) showed that ammonia was oxidized on the surface of the PSTE. However, no oxidation occurred in pure NaOH solution (1.0 mol/L, 70 mL), which indicated that water was not electrolyzed in the given range. As expected, an oxidation peak (−0.26 V) appeared once ammonia was added, which revealed that ammonia was oxidized under the same condition [19]. In addition to the current densities of the oxidation peaks increased, the voltage moved more positive potentials when ammonia concentration increased. Meanwhile, the peak corresponding to hydroxyl desorption (OH− des) shifted from −0.68 to −0.72 V. The peak attributed to hydrogen desorption at −0.37 V (H− des) also shifted towards more negative values before disappearing when 4.0 mL ammonia spirit was added to the NaOH solution. These desorption peaks confirmed that ammonia was selectively oxidized into hydrogen [19]. In addition to improving the mass transfer and regulating the pH values, OH− participated in the reaction. Once the applied voltage increased to 0.8 V, the OH− in solution was oxidized to H2O and O2. Concurrently, as NH3 in solution increased, the possibility of OH− oxidation was decreased. The NO2 − and NO3 − concentrations were lower than the detection limit, which also proved that ammonia was selectively oxidized into nitrogen and hydrogen. These findings indicated that the PSTE can be used to treat aqueous ammonia, ammonia-containing wastewater, hydrazine, and organic amines to obtain hydrogen. To investigate the effect of alkaline concentration, 0.1 mol/L NaOH solution was used for the reaction system using the PSTE and SnOx:Sb/Ti as the electrode, respectively. From Fig. 3, we found that peaks of OHdes −, Hdes and NH3oxi changed, which indicated concentration of OH− affected the electro-oxidation of ammonia to hydrogen. The weakened OH− des peak verified the reaction of OH− and PtSnOx was no longer the main path of ammonia decomposition. Especially, the shifted peak of NH3oxi from −0.25 V to 0.0 V implied that reaction paths would be different under diverse alkaline concentration conditions. Furthermore, both Hdes and OH− des were weakened when SnOx:Sb/Ti was used as the electrode. Meanwhile, peaks at 0.63 V and 0.75 V were appointed the oxidation of NH3 and the form of N2Hx, respectively [19,28]. All data indicated the decomposition of ammonia to produce hydrogen under dilute alkaline or alkaline-free solution was possible. The effect of applied voltage on NOx generation during ammonia decomposition was investigated. NOx levels were recorded by ion chromatography after aqueous ammonia electrolysis at 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 V (Figs. S5 and S6). The generation rate of NO2 − increased as the applied voltage increased, especially at 3.5 V (Fig. S5(a), inset). Similar trends were observed in the relationship between the produced NO3 − and applied voltage (Fig. S5 (b)). The rate constant, k, also revealed that the applied voltage played a critical role in the ammonia decomposition for hydrogen generation under alkaline conditions. The k3.5V/k2.0V values amounted to 6.6 × 102 and 5.4 × 106 for NO2 − and NO3 −, respectively (Table S1), which indicated that the produced NO3 − increased sharply at 3.5 V (Fig. S6). Based on the abovementioned data, a NOx generation pathway was proposed for ammonia decomposition in alkaline media (Scheme 1 ). In this pathway, SnOH reacted with ammonium hydroxide to produce the intermediate SnONH4 + (Scheme 1, part (1)), which gave NO2 − in the presence of OH− (Scheme 1, part (2)). The generation of NO2 − was the rate-determining step at a higher applied voltage. Subsequently, NO2 − was rapidly oxidized to NO3 − in the presence of oxygen, which was released from the electrolysis of water (Scheme 1, parts (3) and (4))."
9,Ammonia electro-oxidation under native pH conditions,"3.3 Ammonia electro-oxidation under native pH conditions Although the aforementioned results indicated that the PSTE was a high-performance electrocatalyst under alkaline conditions, the addition of alkaline compounds (such as NaOH) into aqueous ammonia induced alkali metal contaminations. Moreover, the fact, which ammonia decomposition was also occurred under lower alkaline solution, implied the reaction was realized possibly under alkaline-free condition. Considering the intrinsic alkalinity of ammonia, the catalytic performance of the PSTE was also evaluated in aqueous ammonia without additional pH adjustment. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) suggested that the PSTE effectively electrolyzed ammonia under native pH conditions (Fig. 4 ). CV curve displayed four peaks for hydrogen (−1.5 V), adsorbed hydrogen (−0.5 V), oxidized ammonia (+0.65 V), and oxygen (+2.5 V). In contrast to ammonia decomposition in a 1.0 mol/L NaOH solution (Fig. 3), the oxidation peak of ammonia shifted to 0.65 V and the adsorption of hydroxyl ions (Fig. 4, inset) was very weak under native pH conditions, which indicated that the electro-oxidation mechanism was different from alkaline condition. Moreover, an excess or a deficit of ammonia would not benefit the ammonia decomposition to generate hydrogen, which suggested that water contributed to the reaction as well. A lower ammonia concentration was not conducive to the competitive adsorption of ammonia over water on the Sn(II) surface. On the other hand, the intermolecular repulsive forces of ammonia at a higher concentration increased the desorption energy of N2Hx in the adlayer [28]. Electrocatalytic activity and stability were the critical factors in the oxidation of ammonia to hydrogen. Most electrocatalysts, especially platinum, deactivate rapidly in the presence of ammonia and alkaline solutions because the adsorption of atomic nitrogen and hydroxyl ions blocks surface active sites [19,43]. Therefore, the activity and stability of the PSTE were evaluated continuously for nine weeks (Fig. 5 ). Aqueous ammonia was suitable for the PSTE-catalyzed electro-oxidation to produce hydrogen under native pH conditions. Furthermore, the PSTE remained relatively stable and active after nine weeks, but lower and higher ammonia concentrations were less satisfactory because of competitive reaction with water and ammonia, competitive adsorption of ammonia and hydroxyl ion, and the intermolecular repulsive forces of ammonia, respectively. On the one hand, most of NH3 would react with H2O to generate NH4 + and OH− in the lower ammonia concentrations. The generated OH− would interact with Pt on the SPTE, and the possibility of NH3 adsorbed on the SnOx would reduce sharply because of most of them dissociated to NH4 +. On the other hand, once the higher ammonia concentrations would be used for the generation of hydrogen, the intermolecular repulsive forces hindered NH3 to react with NHx to form N2Hx. Ultimately, the reactivity was decreased due to the wanted N2Hx was not obtained largely. Based on abovementioned analysis and experimental results, the optimum concentration of ammonia in the reaction system should be between 1.9 and 7.5 mol/L. Such a wide range of electrolytic concentration is very conducive to industrial hydrogen production. In particular, hydrogen adsorption (Hads, Fig. 5(a)) and ammonia oxidation (NH3oxi, Fig. 5(b)) retained high current densities after the electrode was used for nine weeks. The ratio of Hads and NH3oxi peak values (Table S2) revealed that the PSTE displayed a surprising stability and activation for ammonia concentrations from 1.9 mol/L to 7.5 mol/L. From the straight slope (Fig. 5(a) and (b)), it was found that the stability of the PSTE increases with the increase of ammonia concentration. The highest stability appeared using ammonia spirit (15.0 mol/L) as the electrolyte, although the activation was not optimal in ammonia spirit solution. Simultaneously, the lowest stability and activation were observed in a 0.2 mol/L ammonia solution. A possible reason was that OH− in water prevented hydrogen spillover on Pt [19–21]. All data indicated that the optimum concentration range was 1.9–7.5 mol/L. To further understand the stability and activity of the SPTE, the reaction rate constants of Hads and NH3oxi were given (Fig. 5(c)). At lower ammonia concentrations (0.2 mol/L), the smaller constants at 0.65 V proved that the oxidation reaction of NH3 was difficult, although the adsorption-desorption of H2 was attractive. Unfortunately, both NH3 oxidation and H2 adsorption-desorption in ammonia spirit were low, indicating high ammonia concentration was unfavorable to produce hydrogen by ammonia decomposition. The reaction rate constants confirmed that moderate ammonia concentrations (Fig. 5(c), grey area) were more suitable for hydrogen generation by oxidation."
10,Deactivation analysis of the PSTE,"3.4 Deactivation analysis of the PSTE To guide the synthesis of high-performance electrocatalysts and understand the reaction process, FT-IR, XRD, and XPS analyses were performed to characterize the PSTE before and after reacting for nine weeks in a 0.2 mol/L ammonia solution. The FT-IR spectra changed dramatically upon reaction (Fig. S2(a) and (b)). Peaks corresponding to SnOH (550 cm−1) and OH (3433 cm−1) disappeared after the reaction, which indicated that OH played a critical role in the decomposition of ammonia. Moreover, the peak at 686 cm−1 indicated that SnO was converted to SnO2 under the applied voltage conditions, weakening the ability of SnOx on the PSTE to adsorb ammonia. Simultaneously, the band at 2382 cm−1 disappeared, which implied that no adsorption bond formed between hydrogen and Pt. The XRD patterns showed some differences in the SnOx-related peaks but little change for their Pt counterparts after reaction (Fig. S3). Especially, peaks attributed to SnOx (1 1 0) and (2 1 1) changed obviously, which indicated the main reason for the deactivation of the anode. Table 1 showed variations between the XPS spectra of Pt and Sn before and after the reaction. During the reaction, Pt0 and Pt2+ were oxidized to generate PtO2 (73.1–76.3 eV) under the sustained interaction of the applied voltage, which suggested that some PtSnOx decomposed into PtO2 and SnO2 [40]. The degradation of PtSnOx reduced the adsorption and desorption of hydrogen on the PSTE. At the same time, Snδ+ (488.0 and 496.0 eV) coexisted with SnO and SnO2, which were also the main components of SnOx. Moreover, the binding energy of O 1s at 532.1 eV disappeared, and a peak appeared at 532.9 eV, which was due to the SnO-bound hydroxyl disappearing after the reaction (Table 1). This indicated that SnO was oxidized to produce SnO2 [44], which decreased the adsorption and oxidation of NH3 on the PSTE."
11,The proposed mechanism of the PSTE under native pH conditions,"3.5 The proposed mechanism of the PSTE under native pH conditions A possible mechanism under native pH conditions was proposed according to the experimental data and the physicochemical properties of the PSTE. Both the electrolyte (NH3, H2O, and OH−) and species (SnO, SnOH, and PtSnOx) on the PSTE surface participated in the reaction. In the absence of applied voltage, aqueous ammonia was free (Scheme 2 , A-1). Once a constant voltage was applied, anodic and cathodic regions displayed different reaction pathways. In the anodic region, ammonia was immediately adsorbed on the surface of SnOx to form OSnNH3 because its lone pair electrons interacted with SnOx (Scheme 2, A-2) [7]. Concomitantly, hydrogen flowed from SnNH3 onto the neighbouring PtSnOx by a hydrogen adsorption effect to form SnNH2 and the PtH bond. The SnNH2 continued adsorbing free ammonia to give SnNH2 NH3 (Scheme 2, A-3) [27]. Thanks to the strong affinity of hydroxyl groups for hydrogen, the oxygen of the SnOH linkage could easily approach PtH, resulting in the SnOH bond breaking and dehydration. Under a low applied potential, the negatively charged hydroxyl ion approached the positively charged SnO framework to reconstruct SnOH. In contrast, under a high applied potential, it moved towards the positively charged SnNH2 to generate the by-products NO2 − and NO3 −. Similar reactions continued until ammonia was fully converted into water and nitrogen gas (Scheme 2, A-4-A-6) [27]. Anode deactivation did not occur unless the hydrogen on SnOH approached PtH to form HPtH, which resulted in hydrogen evolution and highly crystallized SnO2 (Scheme 2, A-7-A-8). In the cathodic region, water was immediately adsorbed to the oxygen atoms of SnOH to give SnOHOH2 (Scheme 2, C-2) due to hydrogen-bonding interactions. Simultaneously, hydrogen on the SnOH migrated to the neighboring Pt to form SnO and PtH bonds (Scheme 1, C-3). Furthermore, if the water was continuously adsorbed on SnO, SnOHOH and HPtH linkages would form in addition to OH (Scheme 2, C-4). Similar reactions continued until ammonia was fully converted into hydroxyl ions and hydrogen (Scheme 2, C-5). This suggests that SnO plays an important role in the activation of the PSTE cathode. The hydrogen evolution mainly occurs on the PSTE cathode due to the presence of the HPtH linkage. The OH– produced in the cathodic region migrates to the anodic region to reactivate the anode. Cathode deactivation would only occur if SnOHHOH was dehydrated (Scheme 2, C-6). Combined FT-IR, XRD, and XPS data, along with the proposed mechanism, indicate that the PSTE is a tri-functionalised electrocatalyst associating the ammonia adsorption function of SnO, the hydrogen transfer function of SnOH, and the hydrogen adsorption function of PtSnOx. Moreover, anodic hydrogen evolution (Scheme 2, A-7 and A-8) and cathodic water production (Scheme 2, C-6) caused the deactivation of the PSTE, which is a critical question. Therefore, how to synthesize a high-performance electrocatalyst would be the key to resolving the life-time and stability problems."
12,Conclusions,"A Pt-(SnOx:Sb)/Ti electrocatalyst was synthesized by an simple layer-by-layer method, which was a more sustainable chemical method than other reported approaches because no additives were used in the reaction system. The catalyst displayed high performance and selective hydrogen generation by ammonia decomposition under alkaline and native pH conditions. It retained its catalytic activity for ammonia decomposition under native pH conditions even after exposure to the ammonia solution for nine weeks. This suggested that the PSTE was a very stable and highly active electrocatalyst. FT-IR, XRD, and XPS analyses showed that the PSTE was a tri-functionalised catalyst, which simultaneously facilitated the ammonia adsorption on SnOx, hydrogen adsorption on PtSnOx, and hydrogen transfer along SnOH. Moreover, the proposed mechanism could guide the synthesis of highly durable electrocatalysts for ammonia decomposition to produce hydrogen."
