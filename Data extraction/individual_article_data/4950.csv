0,Introduction,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a promising carbon feedstock. In carbon capture and usage (CCU), it serves as a one-carbon synthetic (C1) building block [1–5], and it has large potential for hydrogen storage [6–8]. While activation and functionalization of neutral CO2 are challenging [9], electron attachment generates the potentially reactive carbon dioxide radical anion CO2 − [10–13]. Bare CO2 has a negative electron affinity and CO2 − undergoes auto detachment [14–16], but solvation with CO2 or H2O [10–12] as well as interaction with metal centers [17,18] stabilizes the radical. The electronic structure of solvated CO2 − has been elucidated by photoelectron spectroscopy [19–22]. Formation of CH, CN, and CS bonds has been mechanistically studied in gas phase clusters [23–27], and radical substitution with CH3I to form CH3CO2 − has been reported [28,29]. In the condensed phase, pulse radiolysis studies [30] report adduct formation of CO2 − with NO [31], pyridin-3-ol [32], 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane [33], and acrylamide [34], as well as hydrogen atom transfer from SH groups to form HCOO− [35–37]. For use of CO2 as a C1 building block, addition of CO2 − to a vinyl group is a key step in possible large-scale polymer production processes [5]. Electrocarboxylation of olefins has been reported already in the early 1970s [38–39]. A mechanistic understanding on a molecular level, however, is still lacking. We have recently studied the addition of the carbon dioxide radical anion to methyl acrylate [40]. Here we present a combined experimental and theoretical study of the addition of CO2 − to allyl alcohol C3H5OH in gas phase water clusters."
1,Experimental and computational details,"The mass spectra were recorded on a modified Bruker Spectrospin CMS47X FT-ICR mass spectrometer [41,42], equipped with a Bruker Infinity cell and an APEX III data station. CO2 −(H2O) n , n ≈20–50, were produced in an external laser vaporization source [43–45] as described before [42]. The ions were transferred by electrostatic lenses through several stages of differential pumping into the high-field region of the superconducting magnet and stored inside the ICR cell. Allyl alcohol (Sigma–Aldrich, ≥99%), degassed by three cycles of pump-freeze-thaw, is introduced to the cell region of the mass spectrometer via a needle valve at a constant pressure in the range of 2.0×10−9 to 5.0×10−8 mbar. The reaction is monitored by taking mass spectra with different reaction delays. Quantum chemical calculations at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory were performed with the Gaussian09 program package [46] to aid and support the interpretation of our experimental results. All reported energies are zero-point corrected."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Experimental results,"3.1 Experimental results When hydrated carbon dioxide radical anions CO2 −(H2O) n , n ≈20–50, are exposed to gaseous C3H5OH in the cell of a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer, a sequential uptake of the reactant is observed. This uptake is accompanied by the loss of water molecules due to the heat released by the uptake of C3H5OH in the cluster, reaction (1), and due to black-body infrared radiative dissociation (BIRD) [47–58], reaction (2). (1) [CO2,(C3H5OH) m ,(H2O) n ] − +C3H5OH→[CO2,(C3H5OH) m+1,(H2O) n−x ] − + xH2O (2) [CO2,(C3H5OH) m ,(H2O) n ] − + hν →[CO2,(C3H5OH) m ,(H2O) n−1] − +H2O A typical mass spectrum for the reaction of CO2 −(H2O) n with C3H5OH after 2s reaction delay is shown in Fig. 1 . Summing the intensities over all cluster sizes n, a kinetic fit can be applied to the data assuming a pseudo-first order rate law. The corresponding kinetic analysis is shown in Fig. 2 . The rate coefficients for reaction (1) for m =0–3 are listed in Table 1 . They are quite similar (1.4–1.6×10−9 cm3 s−1) and lie close to theoretical collision rates [59] estimated with the surface charge capture (SCC) model, k SCC =1.5×10−9 cm3 s−1, and the hard-sphere average dipole orientation (HSA) model, k HSA =1.4×10−9 cm3 s−1, assuming a hard-sphere radius of 3.5Å for C3H5OH. This clearly indicates that reaction (1) proceeds close to collision rate. The nanocalorimetric analysis [42] of reaction (1) yields x =1.6±1.0 for m =0 and x =1.0±0.8 for m =1, 2 (Table 1). These values correspond to reaction enthalpies of 69±43kJ/mol for m =0 and 43±35kJ/mol for m =1, 2. Both the rate coefficients and nanocalorimetry are consistent with an exchange of water for allyl alcohol. The higher nanocalorimetry value for the first reaction step is potentially caused by formation of a weak covalent bond. After 20s, all water molecules are evaporated, and [CO2,(C3H5OH) m ] − remain, as shown in Fig. 3a. These species slowly lose allyl alcohol until m =1 is reached. Interestingly, a new product with the composition [CO2,C3H5OH,H]− is clearly visible in the mass spectra after 50s, displayed in Fig. 3b. This suggests that [CO2,C3H5OH] − undergo a very slow hydrogen atom transfer in collisions with allyl alcohol, reaction (3). The neutral allyl alcohol radical C3H4OH formed in reaction (3) is resonance stabilized. (3) [CO2,C3H5OH] − +C3H5OH→[CO2,C3H5OH,H]− +C3H4OH To confirm this interpretation, [CO2,(C3H5OH)2] − was mass selected after 20s, and the kinetics followed for additional 200s. The kinetic fit of this experiment is displayed in Fig. 4 . The primary reaction is unimolecular loss of C3H5OH, while [CO2,C3H5OH,H]− is fitted best as a secondary product. This hydrogen atom transfer is strong evidence that a new CC bond has been formed in [CO2,C3H5OH] − between the carbon dioxide radical anion and the vinyl group of allyl alcohol. The two conceivable reaction pathways for CC bond formation, followed by hydrogen atom transfer, are displayed in Scheme 1 . The experimental data, however, leave two questions open: Is the newly formed CC bond really so weak that only 69±43kJ/mol are released, or is the CC bond formed only delayed? Why is H atom transfer only observed for [CO2,C3H5OH] − colliding with a new molecule C3H5OH, and not in the decomposition of [CO2,(C3H5OH)2] −?"
4,Density functional theory studies,"3.2 Density functional theory studies To gain insight into the mechanism of the reaction of CO2 − with allyl alcohol, our experimental observations are complemented by quantum chemical calculations at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory. The possible carboxylated products formed from the reaction of CO2 − with allyl alcohol are shown in Scheme 1. Both radicals formed in the potential pathways (a) and (b) of Scheme 1 are distonic radical anions [60–62], i.e. negative charge and radical are located at different carbon atoms. As expected, the secondary radical 1, the carboxylation product of pathway (a), is 17kJ/mol more stable than the primary radical 2 from pathway (b), and radical addition to the terminal carbon atom is less sterically hindered. In addition, the radical anion 1 has been observed in electron spin resonance by Norman et al. [63], while 2 is not known in the literature. All arguments support the interpretation that 1 is the carboxylation product formed in the experiments. Mechanisms of the formation of both structures 1 and 2 for the reactions of small model systems CO2 −(H2O) n , n =0–5, with allyl alcohol have been further examined using DFT calculations. The solvation shells were built up by successive addition of water molecules based on structures obtained from earlier works [13,19,27]. The potential energy surface (PES) for n =5 and the corresponding structures for pathway (a) is shown in Fig. 5 . Solvating an allyl alcohol onto the lowest-energy structure of CO2 −(H2O)5 (R) [19] yields the initial complex C, in which the hydroxyl group of the allyl alcohol is hydrogen bonding to one oxygen atom of CO2 − and one hydrogen atom of the water network with bond lengths of 1.80Å and 1.95Å, respectively. Bond rotations of the allyl alcohol with its terminal carbon being moved toward the carbon atom of CO2 − results in the transition structure TS, featuring an imaginary vibrational mode aligned with the direction of the incipient CC bond with a length of 2.33Å. In the product P, the covalent CC bond is formed with the bond distance of 1.57Å and both oxygen atoms of the carboxylate group remain solvated by the water network. The product energy of −78kJ/mol, relative to the separated reactants, is close within error limit to the nanocalorimetric value of −69±43kJ/mol. Similar calculations for pathway (b) give the transition structure and product with relative energies of 8kJ/mol and −60kJ/mol, respectively. To illustrate the accessibility of reaction pathways (a) and (b), the barrier heights for reaction (4) (E TS(C-a) and E TS(b)) and its reverse reaction (E TS(P-a) and E TS(P-b)) as a function of the number of water molecules n in the cluster are plotted in Fig. 6 . For comparison, the energies needed to evaporate a water molecule from the clusters, reaction (5), are also given. (4) CO2 −(C3H5OH)(H2O) n →HOC3H5COO −(H2O) n (5) CO2 −(C3H5OH)(H2O) n →CO2 −(C3H5OH)(H2O) n−1 +H2O The barriers of the forward reactions for pathway (a) (E TS(C-a)) are around 25–30kJ/mol, which are significantly higher than that for pathway (b) (E TS(C-b)) and the evaporation of water. Therefore, the formation of 1 via pathway (a) is preferred. For the reverse reactions, the activation energies for both pathways (E TS(P-a) and E TS(P-b)) are almost identical and are significantly higher than the energy of water evaporation for n >1. It is therefore highly unlikely that the reverse reaction occurs under the conditions of the experiment. To learn why the hydrogen atom transfer reaction (3) is observed only with unsolvated 1, PESs of the reaction of HOC3H5COO − solvated with m =1 or 2 additional molecules of allyl alcohol have been calculated. Only the reaction (3) for product 1 was considered. The PESs are shown in Fig. 7 . The initial complex C R is formed by a hydrogen bond between the OH group of the neutral allyl alcohol and an oxygen atom of the carboxylate group, with a distance of 1.74Å. In the transition structure, an allyl hydrogen in the neutral molecule is transferring to the radical site of the distonic radical anion 1. The product complex C P features the planar neutral radical C3H4OH which is hydrogen bonded to the final ionic product HOC3H6COO− (3). In agreement with experiment, the transition structure of the hydrogen atom transfer lies below the entrance channel only for m =1. The barrier for m =2, however, lies 10kJ/mol above the entrance channel."
5,Conclusions,"The carbon dioxide radical anion, stabilized in gas-phase water clusters, can form a weak covalent bond with allyl alcohol. Experiment and calculations are consistent with a covalent bond formation upon uptake of the first molecule allyl alcohol, but a delayed formation of this bond cannot be strictly ruled out. Additional allyl alcohol molecules are added to the cluster via ligand exchange. In combination with a detailed theoretical study of CO2 −(H2O) n with n =0–5, it was possible to describe the mechanism of the functionalization of hydrated carbon dioxide radical anion with allyl alcohol in the gas phase. The product is a distonic radical anion, with the radical located in the secondary carbon, while the charge is located in the carboxylate group (1). In the late stage of the reaction, this radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from a neutral allyl alcohol molecule, resulting in HOC3H6COO− (3) as the final product."
