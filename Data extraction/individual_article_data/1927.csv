0,Introduction,"Furfuryl alcohol (FOL), as one of the most important chemicals, can be produced by the CO bond hydrogenation of hemicellulose-derived furfural (FAL) platform molecule [1]. Further, a variety of high value-added compounds, such as 2-methylfuran, cyclopentanone (CPO), pentanediol, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, can be produced by selective hydrogenation/hydrodeoxygenation of FOL [2–6]. Considering several disadvantages of homogeneous catalysis including easy loss of active components and difficult separation/recovery, recently, supported noble metal catalysts have been employed in the FAL hydrogenation to produce FOL [7–11]. However, their applications are greatly limited due to the high cost and the scarcity of these metals. Therefore, it is desirable to develop highly efficient non-noble metal catalysts in the above reaction. Up to now, among non-noble metal catalysts, various Cu-based catalysts, such as Cu/Cr2O3, Cu/SiO2, and Cu/ZnO [12–14], are investigated widely. Recently, Zhu et al. reported Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 catalyzed FAL hydrogenation under relatively mild reaction conditions [15,16]. Although high FOL yields can be achieved through gas-phase hydrogenation of FAL under high reaction temperatures and hydrogen partial pressures [17], the reactors easily are blocked by reactants due to the thermal sensitivity. On the other side, as a versatile chemical used for the manufacture of various pharmaceuticals, polymers, and flavors [18,19], CPO can be traditionally produced through the pyrolysis of fossil-derived adipic acid and relevant derivatives, as well as the cyclopentene oxidation, under harsh reaction conditions and cumbersome processes [20,21]. More attractively, CPO can be synthesized by eco-friendly aqueous phase FAL hydrogenation on some monometallic and bimetallic catalysts (e.g. Pt, Pd, Au, Ni-Cu, Pt-Co) [22–27]. For example, a Pd–Cu catalyst was reported to achieve a high CPO yield of about 90.3% at 160 °C and 3 MPa hydrogen pressure [28], while supported Cu-based catalysts could afford relatively high CPO yields (62% for CuZnAl and 81% for CuZn/carbon nanotubes) at 4.0 MPa hydrogen pressure [29,30]. Very recently, we reported a Cu/ZrO2 catalyst, which delivered a high yield of CPO (91.3%) under mild conditions (i.e. 1.5 MPa hydrogen pressure and 150 °C) [31]. Although some promising results are obtained based on aqueous phase FAL hydrogenation, further exploration is requirable to develop new efficient and structurally stable non-noble metal catalysts for practical industrial application. Presently, owing to several structural advantages including high mechanical robustness, favorable heat/mass transfer property, and low-pressure drop in complex catalytic systems, heterogeneous structured catalysts have received increasing attention [32–34]. Compared with traditional catalyst systems, they showed superior catalytic performances. As for metallic foam-based catalysts, however, there exist some disadvantages such as the deficiency of surface-active sites and easy exfoliation of surface coatings [35–37], thereby leading to their low performance. In this regard, presently, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and derived mixed metal oxides (MMOs) film materials have attracting increasing interest [38–44], due to their significant performance in surface chemistry and catalysis. Moreover, LDH materials also are known as the precursors of metal catalysts, because divalent and trivalent cations can uniformly distribute within on the brucite-like layers at the atomic scale [45]. Subsequently, highly dispersive metal-based catalysts can be constructed by the topological transformation of LDH precursors [46]. In this contribution, new structured Cu-based film catalysts with large quantities of interlaced aligned nanosheets on the anodic aluminum oxide/aluminum (AAO/Al) substrate were successfully fabricated through in situ growth of CuZnAl-LDH precursors on the AAO/Al substrate. As-fabricated structured Cu-based film catalysts with abundant mutual interfaces between highly dispersed metallic copper nanoparticles (NPs) and ZnAl-MMO component, surface three-dimensional porous nano/microstructure, and appropriate surface acidity showed excellent catalytic performance in the FAL hydrogenation to produce FOL and CPO under mild reaction conditions, and the formation of FOL and CPO in the FAL hydrogenation can be well controlled by adjusting reaction temperature. Meanwhile, strong interactions between surface copper-containing nanosheets and the substrate and between copper species and ZnAl-MMO component within nanosheets are beneficial to the improvement in the structural stability of Cu-based film catalysts. Up to now, there is no report about such 3D structured copper-based film catalysts for FAL hydrogenation to produce FOL or CPO in water."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation of samples,"2.1 Preparation of samples The AAO/Al substrate was prepared by our previously reported anodization method [47]. The thickness of the AAO/Al substrate obtained is about 0.1 mm. First, an AAO/Al substrate with the area of 40 cm2 was immersed into a solution with a total metal concentration of 0.02 M and a Cu/(Zn + Cu) molar ratio of x:5 (x = 0, 3, 4 or 5), where NH4NO3 (0.5 M), Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved into deionized water. Subsequently, the dilute ammonia–water was added to adjust the pH value of the solution to about 7.0. Then, the suspension was aged at 80 °C and held for 16 h to obtain LDH film precursor (denoted as Cu-x-L). The resultant film sample was washed with deionized water and calcined at 500 °C for 3 h to obtain calcined samples (denoted as Cu-x-C). At last, the calcined films were heated to 300 °C at a ramping rate of 2 °C/min in a 10% (v/v) H2/Ar atmosphere and held for 3 h to get structured film samples (denoted as Cu-x-F). Moreover, a reference powdered sample (Cu-4-P) was synthesized based on the above procedure without the addition of AAO/Al substrate in the presence of Al(NO3)3·9H2O (0.02 M)."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The metal contents in samples was analyzed on an ICPS-7500 inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) produced by Shimadzu Ltd. Company. Before the ICP-AES analysis, a part of LDH layer in situ grown on the substrate was scraped off with the knife to determine surface Cu/(Zn + Cu) and M2+/Al3+ molar ratios. In addition, after dissolving the film sample in dilute hydrochloric acid (6.0 M), the actual copper mass per unit area of film could be determined. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected from Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer using a Cu Kα radiation. Micromeritics ASAP 2020 sorptometer was applied to carry out low-temperature nitrogen adsorption-desorption experiments. Supra 55 electron microscope was used to perform scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were observed on a JEOL JEM-2010 electron microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) data were obtained using VG ESCALAB 2201 XL spectrometer at an Al Kα X-ray radiation (1486.6 eV). H2-N2O titration was performed on Micromeritics ChemiSorb 2920 instrument to determine the copper surface area of film samples. First, calcined film samples (40 cm2) were reduced under a 10% v/v H2/Ar flow (40 ml/min) at 300 °C to obtain the amount of H2 consumption (X). After reduction, a 10% N2O/N2 flow was purged to oxide the reduced sample. At last, another reduction process was carried out to obtain another amount of H2 consumption (Y). Based on the amounts of H2 consumption in the H2-N2O titration, the dispersion of Cu0 (Dis) can be estimated according to the equation (Dis = 2 × Y/X). Assuming a spherical shape of Cu0 particle with a surface copper concentration of 1.47 × 1019/m2, the Cu surface area could be gained and the particle size of Cu0 particles (DN2O) can be estimated according to the equation (DN2O = 0.5 × X/Y). Micromeritics ChemiSorb 2920 was used to perform hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) experiments. For H2-TPR, the sample was reduced under a mixture gas of H2 and Ar (10%, 40 ml/min) at a rising rate of 10 °C min−1 from 50 °C to 400 °C. For NH3-TPD, the reduced sample was degassed under He flow at 300 °C for 1 h and switched a NH3/He flow (5% v/v) for 1.5 h at 50 °C. Subsequently, the sample was purged with a He flow for 1 h. Finally, NH3 was desorbed at a ramping rate of 10 °C min−1. In situ infrared (IR) spectra of FAL adsorption were collected using Thermo Nicolet 380 FTIR spectrophotometer. First, a self-supporting wafer of powdered sample scrapped from films (0.3 mg) was placed into the IR cell then evacuated at 350 °C for 1 h. FAL was introduced at 30 °C and held for 1 h. At last, IR spectra of FAL adsorption were recorded under vacuum."
4,Aqueous-phase hydrogenation of FAL,"2.3 Aqueous-phase hydrogenation of FAL Aqueous-phase hydrogenation of FAL was conducted in a 50 ml of stainless-steel autoclave reactor. First, the film catalyst (40 cm2) was fixed in the upper Teflon holder (Fig. S1), and then FAL (0.1 ml) and deionized water (20 ml) were added into the reactor. After that, nitrogen was purged into the reactor for three times. When the reactor was heated to a certain temperature, H2 was purged and pressurized to a certain partial pressure and the hydrogenation reaction was initiated at a stirring speed of 900 rpm. After the reaction, trichloromethane was added to the reaction solution at room temperature and stirred to extract the reactants. The above extraction process was repeated for three times. Liquid products were quantitatively analyzed on a gas chromatograph (Agilent GC7890B) equipped with DB-WAX capillary column and flame ionization detector by external standard method. The detector temperature was set at 240 °C, while the column temperature was elevated from 100 to 240 °C with a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. In all cases, the carbon balance was above 98%. And, gas chromatogram spectra of FAL feedstock and reactants (Figs. S2 and S3) reveal that besides FOL, CPO and cyclopentanol (CPL), no other products could be detected. The conversion and product selectivities were calculated by following Eqs. (1) and (2): (1) Conversion ( % ) = Numbers of converted FAL (mol) Numbers of total FAL feedstock (mol) × 100 % (2) Selectivity ( % ) = Numbers of a single product formed (mol) Numbers of converted FAL (mol) × 100 %"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Structural analysis of samples,"3.1 Structural analysis of samples XRD patterns of as-fabricated LDH film precursors with different Cu/(Zn + Cu) molar ratios are shown in Fig. 1 A. Obviously, two series of weak characteristic (0 0 3), (0 0 6), (0 0 9) and/or (0 1 2) diffractions indexed to nitrate-type and carbonate-type LDH phases with two different basal spacings of about 1.0 and 0.8 nm can be observed in each case [48], besides strong characteristic diffractions assigned to the Al substrate at about 45° and 65°, respectively. No other phases can be detected. It reflects the successful formation of LDH layer over the substrate. Interestingly, the stronger (0 1 2) plane of LDH phase suggests a prior orientation of LDH crystallites over the substrate, where the ab plane is well-ordered perpendicularly to the substrate. And, the broad diffraction between 10 and 20° is a character of the sample holder used for XRD measurement (Fig. S4). During the synthesis of film precursor, surface AAO layer formed can be easily activated to form Al(OH)4 - ions in the presence of divalent metal ions [49–52]. Furthermore, the ICP-AES results of aqueous ammonia solution used for the preparation of LDH films confirm the existence of Al3+ ions in the synthesis solution. Subsequently, LDH crystallites may in situ grow on the substrate via a heterogeneous nucleation-growth mode [47], resulting in tight attaching of LDH crystallites to the substrate and thus the formation of strong LDH layer-substrate interactions. The ICP-AES analysis determines Cu/(Zn + Cu) and M2+/Al3+ molar ratios on the surface LDH layer in LDH precursor films (Table 1 ). In addition, surface Cu/(Zn + Cu) molar ratios obtained by the XPS results are almost the same as those measured by the ICP-AES (Table S1), further confirming the homogeneity of the surface LDH phase in LDH film precursors. After calcination and reduction, three Cu-containing film samples present the characteristic diffractions for metallic copper phase (Fig. 1B). In the case of Cu-free Cu-0-F film, XRD patterns only show characteristic peaks of ZnO phase, besides those for the Al substrate. However, no crystalline alumina phase can be observed, mainly due to the formation of amorphous Al2O3 and/or ZnAl-MMO component. For reduced Cu-containing film samples, these Al2O3 and ZnAl-MMO components as dispersive phases can improve the dispersion of metallic copper species (Table 1). Especially, Cu-4-F possesses the highest dispersion degree of copper and surface metallic copper area. The above results illustrate the reduction of Cu2+ species within surface layers. According to the mass loss after calcination and reduction, the mass of the surface reduced layer on the substrate also is determined (Table 1). Fig. 2 a and b present SEM images of Cu-4-L film precursor. Noticeably, many interlaced and vertically aligned platelet-like LDH nanosheets with the thickness of about 100–200 nm are grown almost perpendicularly on the substrate, thus forming a 3D highly porous surface nest-like framework. In addition, other film precursors also present a similar surface microstructure with many interlaced nanosheets to that for Cu-4-L sample (Fig. S5), while the cross-section SEM image of Cu-4-L sample reveals that the thickness of surface LDH layer is about 4.3 μm (Fig. S6). After calcination and reduction, the resultant Cu-4-F film completely remains its initial surface morphology (Fig. 2c), despite the formation of metallic copper and ZnAl-MMO phase within the nanosheets, while the EDX spectrum of Cu-4-F film (Fig. 2d) reveals the presence of Cu, Zn, and Al elements. Further, based on the cross-section image of Cu-4-F film, the thickness of the surface layer on the substrate is determined to be about 3.8 μm (inset in Fig. 2d). TEM and HRTEM images of different reduced Cu-based film samples are shown in Fig. 3 . In each case, small black copper NPs with narrow particle distributions are evenly distributed within the surface nanosheet layer. However, with the increasing Cu/(Zn + Cu) molar ratio, the average diameter of Cu NPs slightly increases based on the particle size distributions, mainly due to the increasing Cu loading amount in samples. It is noted that the crystalline sizes of metal copper nanoparticle deduced from the XRD line broadening of (1 1 1) plane are slightly larger than those values obtained from TEM images (Table S1), due to the irregular shape of Cu0 particles. In the cases of Cu-4-F and Cu-5-F samples, however, the sizes of Cu0 particles calculated from N2O titration are smaller than those obtained from the XRD and TEM results (Table S1), probably due to the occurrence of strong interaction between Cu0 particles and ZnAl-MMO and thus the formation of a large amount of Cu0 particles with irregular shapes. Typically, for Cu-4-F sample, copper NPs are well-dispersed within the nanosheet, and two well-resolved crystalline lattice spacings of about 0.208 and 0.247 nm are associated with the (1 1 1) and (1 0 1) planes of metallic copper and ZnO, respectively. In comparison, the XRD patterns of powdered Cu-4-P sample present intensive characteristic diffractions of metallic copper phase, indicative of the formation of large-sized Cu0 particles (Fig. S7). Further, as further evidenced by the TEM image (Fig. S7), a large amount of uneven large-sized Cu particles with the average particle size of about 31 nm can be observed."
7,Surface property of samples,"3.2 Surface property of samples To uncover the structural character of calcined Cu-containing LDH film precursors, H2-TPR characterization of samples were performed (Fig. 4 ). Obviously, TPR curves of samples present a wide and asymmetric reduction region in the range of 170–350 °C, mirroring the formation of several chemical states of copper species. Calcined CuAl-LDH film (Cu-5-C) presents an intensive main reduction peak of Cu2+ species assigned to bulk CuO at about 270 °C, with a small and broad reduction peak at about 231 °C attributable to the reduction of highly dispersed Cu2+ species. Meanwhile, the peak at a higher temperature of 300 °C corresponds to the reduction of large-sized CuO particles in bulk. Obviously, with the introduction of Zn, the intensity of the high-temperature reduction peak is reduced and finally, it disappears in the case of Cu-3-C sample. While the reduction peak related to highly dispersed Cu2+ species also negatively shift to 223 °C for Cu-4-C to 207 °C for Cu-3-C. Especially, for Cu-3-C sample, the temperature of the main reduction peak is lowered to about 235 °C. The above results strongly illustrate the enhancement of copper dispersion within the surface layer due to the formation of ZnAl-MMO phase in samples [53,54]. In addition, based on the amounts of H2 consumption in the TPR process (Table 1), the reduction degree of copper species from Cu2+ to Cu0 is calculated to about 0.95 for Cu-3-F, 0.93 for Cu-4-F, and 0.89 for Cu-5-F, considering the absence of Cu+ species in reduced samples (see the following XPS results). In this case, unreduced Cu2+ species may exist in the form of Cu-containing spinels. It further confirms that the reduction of Cu2+ species can be enhanced with the increasing Zn content. XPS characterization was carried out to determine surface chemical states of Cu and Zn species on samples (Fig. 5 ). As for Cu-containing film samples, the fine Cu 2p3/2 spectra deconvoluted by Gaussian peak fitting shows two peaks at binding energies (BEs) of about 932.4 and 936.5 eV, respectively, indicative the existence of Cu0/Cu+ and Cu2+ species [55,56]. Specially, the small peak at 936.5 eV may be correlated with Cu2+ bonded to Zn2+ and Al3+ ions in spinels. Further, as shown in the inset in Fig. 5A, a broad peak in Cu LMM XAES of Cu-4-F sample is attributable to Cu0 species at the kinetic energy of about 918.7 eV [57,58]. While no signal of Cu+ species at about 916.5 eV can be observed in three cases. The above results confirm the reduction of cationic Cu species into metallic copper species. Correspondingly, surface Cu0/(Cu0 + Cu2+) ratio in reduced film samples is determined to be 0.87 for Cu-5-F, 0.90 for Cu-4-F, and 0.91 for Cu-3-F, well consistent with the above TPR results. As for Zn-containing samples, two peaks belonging to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 core levels of Zn2+ species appear at about 1022 and 1045 eV, respectively. It is interesting to note that higher BEs of Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 core levels for Cu-4-F sample appear at 1023.2 and 1046.1 eV, respectively, reflecting the formation of stronger interactions between Cu species and ZnAl-MMO component with the surface layers. Further, NH3-TPD experiments were performed to determine surface acidity of reduced film samples (Fig. 6 ). In all cases, there is a wide desorption in the range of 50–850 °C. According to the shapes of desorption peaks, the desorption can be approximately divided into three regions in the temperature range of about 50–200 °C, 200–450 °C and 450–850 °C, which are attributable to NH3 desorption on weak acidic sites, medium-strength acidic sites and strong acidic sites [59,60], respectively. The weak acidic sites and medium-strength or strong acidic sites are associated with surface metal-hydroxyl groups and metal-oxygen pairs, respectively. Further, a quantitative result of surface acidity shows that the surface density of total acidic sites on film samples decreases in the following order: Cu-0-F > Cu-4-F > Cu-3-F > Cu-5-F (Table 2 ). Notably, with the introduction of ZnO, the second desorption region corresponding to medium-strength acidic sites is progressively enhanced, which originates from the existence of more surface Zn–O pairs. Especially, the surface density of strong acidic sites on the Cu-4-F sample is the largest among these Cu-containing film samples, probably because of the formation of more highly dispersive ZnAl-MMO component with the enhanced metal-support interactions, as evidenced by the above XPS results."
8,Catalytic performance of structured Cu-based film catalysts,"3.3 Catalytic performance of structured Cu-based film catalysts To demonstrate the structural advantage of the as-fabricated structured Cu-based film catalysts, the aqueous-phase hydrogenation of FAL into FOL was first evaluated as a probe reaction to study their catalytic performance. We applied Cu-free Cu-0-F film, Zn-free Cu-5-F film, Zn-containing Cu-based films (Cu-4-F and Cu-3-F), and powdered Cu-containing Cu-4-P sample to study the function of ZnAl-MMO and film structure at 100 °C and 2.0 MPa hydrogen pressure. Typically, FAL (0.1 ml, 1.2 mmol) was dispersed in water (20 ml) to form a homogeneous suspension under stirring. The structured film catalysts (40 cm2) were fixed into the upper part of suspension in the reactor filled with hydrogen (Fig. S1). After the reaction, the film catalysts could be directly taken out from the reactor. Under the present reaction conditions, other by-products stemming from the aromatic ring hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation of carbonyl groups cannot be detected (Figs. S2 and S3). Further, combining the results of the carbon balance, polymerization reaction between FAL and FOL do not easily occur under the present mild reaction conditions (i.e., low reaction temperatures in the range of 100–150 °C). Therefore, the influence of non-detected products on the quantification of products can be ignored. As shown in Fig. 7 A, over the Cu-5-F film, a 56.0% FOL yield is achieved after a reaction of 2 h. In the case of Cu-4-F film, FOL yield reaches as high as 93.6% after 2 h, despite the lower Cu content in the Cu-4-F than that in the Cu-5-F. Furthermore, FAL can be completely converted into FOL over the Cu-4-F catalyst in 3 h, indicative of an absolute reduction of the CO bond in FAL. Meanwhile, as presented in Fig. S8, the initial formation rate of FOL over the Cu-4-F film almost raises linearly with the increase in the area of surface active layer (namely, the amount of the surface active layer), demonstrating a first-order kinetic relationship with the mass of surface active layer. With the increasing content of Zn, FAL conversion is decreased to 37.7% over the Cu-3-F film, due to the smaller content of Cu species suppressing the catalytic activity. Noticeably, as the metallic copper surface area of Cu-x-F film catalysts increases, conversion of FAL gradually increases (Fig. 7A), indicating that the metallic property of Cu-x-F catalysts can play an important role in governing their catalytic activity. Note that Cu-0-F film only delivers a trace FAL conversion of 0.6%, due to the absence of copper species. In comparison, a low 12.6% FOL yield is achieved over the powdered Cu-4-P sample, which is correlated with the poor dispersion of active copper species originating from its much larger size of Cu0 particles. To determine the intrinsic activity of different structured Cu-based catalysts, the turnover frequency (TOF) of FAL converted was obtained based on the moles of converted FAL per mole surface metallic copper in the initial 10 min. As presented in Fig. 7B, the TOF value over the Cu-4-F film reaches 23 h−1, which is much higher than those over other Cu-based film catalysts. In addition, the TOF value over the powdered Cu-4-P catalyst is much lower than those of other Cu-based film catalysts. The above great difference in the TOF value for different Cu-based catalysts illustrates that surface Cu0 species are not the sole active sites for the FAL hydrogenation. Besides active Cu0 sites, abundant surface acidic sites at the interface between Cu NPs and Al2O3 or ZnAl-MMO interface, especially, strong acidic sites, may coordinate the carbonyl oxygen in FAL in the course of FAL hydrogenation, probably efficiently improving the instinct activity of structured film catalysts. To further understand the origin of active sites in the present Cu-based film catalyst system, in situ IR spectra of FAL adsorption on different structured samples were collected (Fig. 8 ). All samples present two absorption peaks: one weak peak at about 1722 cm−1, which is indexed to the CO stretching vibration due to the physisorption of FAL molecule; another absorption band at about 1672 cm−1, which is correlated with the decreased energy of CO bond due to chemical adsorption of FAL. Especially, the strongest adsorption at 1672 cm−1 is detected in the case of Cu-4-F sample. In contrast, the weakest chemical adsorption of FAL occurs on the surface of Cu-0-F sample. In the cases of Cu-containing films, Al2O3 or ZnAl-MMO component functioning as Lewis acidic sites can govern the adsorption and activation of FAL molecule through the coordination of the lone pair of electrons of the CO bond with acidic sites. For Cu-4-F, the greatly enhanced chemical absorption of FAL may be correlated with the presence of more strong acidic sites, thus easily activating the CO bond in FAL in the course of FAL hydrogenation. Further, we investigated the change in the FAL conversion and the selectivities of products with different reaction temperatures from 100 to 150 °C over the Cu-4-F film in the FAL hydrogenation after a reaction of 2 h. As shown in Fig. 9 , FAL conversion is slightly increased from 93.6 to 98.1% with the elevated reaction temperature from 100 to 110 °C, along with a decreased FOL selectivity of 96.3%, due to the production of a small amount of CPO through the rearrangement of FOL and following hydrogenation [61]. Further increasing reaction temperature from 110 to 120 °C leads to a slightly increased conversion up to 100%. With the elevated reaction temperature from 110 to 140 °C, the CPO selectivity is rapidly increased from 3.7 to 86.5%. Meanwhile, a small amount of CPL is formed through the CO bond reduction in CPO molecule. When the reaction temperature is elevated to 150 °C, the CPL selectivity is increased to 9.5%. The above results indicate that in the course of hydrogenation, FAL can be first efficiently converted into FOL and then FOL intermediate in aqueous medium is further converted into CPO or CPL at higher reaction temperatures (>100 °C). Therefore, Cu-4-F catalyst can not only facilitate the CO bond reduction in FAL but also favor the FOL rearrangement to CPO. For comparison, as shown in Fig. 10 , Cu-0-F film only exhibits a very low activity with a 3.5% FAL conversion at 140 °C and 2 MPa hydrogen pressure after a reaction of 2 h. In addition to the production of a small amount of CPL, the CPO selectivity gradually decreases from 86.5% over the Cu-4-F to 82.5% over the Cu-3-F and 37.3% over the Cu-5-F, despite a slightly decreased FAL conversion, mainly due to the decreasing amount of surface total acidic sites. While pure LDH-derived Cu-4-P catalyst only afforded a low CPO yield of 13.4% at a FAL conversion of 43.4%. Compared with some previously reported metal-based catalysts including noble metal catalysts [19,28,29,62–66], the present Cu-4-F film catalyst shows better catalytic performance in terms of the FAL conversion and the selectivity of FOL or CPO (Table S2), despite different reaction conditions. The above characteristic and experimental results show that the variation in the Cu/(Zn + Cu) molar ratio in structured Cu-based film catalysts can lead to changes in the surface property of samples including the dispersion of copper species, the number of surface-active sites and surface acidity. In the present catalytic system, although the actual content of active copper species applied in the Cu-4-F film is equal to that in the powdered Cu-4-P sample, as-fabricated structured Cu-based catalyst shows much better catalytic performance for the FAL hydrogenation. Moreover, the instinct activity of Cu-4-F catalyst (i.e. TOF value) is much higher than those of other Cu-containing film catalysts. The high catalytic efficiency of the catalyst may be attributable to the following three factors: (i) In the present Cu-based catalyst system, Cu0 species should be main catalytic active sites for the dissociation of hydrogen in the FAL hydrogenation to produce FOL or CPO [16,67]. While Al2O3 or ZnAl-MMO component within surface nanosheets functioning as acidic sites can contribute to the adsorption/activation of FAL and the transformation of FOL to CPO [68]. Despite the smaller amount of copper species in the Cu-4-F than that in the Cu-5-F, surface metallic copper area of Cu-4-F determined by N2O titration is larger than that of Cu-5-F catalyst (Table 1), accounting for the increased activity of Cu-4-F catalyst to some extent. Despite the smaller amount of copper species in the Cu-3-F, the higher density of surface acidic sites on the Cu-3-F than that on the Cu-5-F can facilitate the transformation of FOL to CPO, thus leading to a higher CPO yield than that over the Cu-5-F film. (ii) In comparison to that in the Cu-4-P, stronger interface interaction between highly dispersed copper NPs and adjacent ZnAl-MMO component in the Cu-4-F can be formed within surface active nanosheets, due to the formation of abundant metal-support interface, thus greatly facilitating the activation of the carbonyl group. (iii) Unique surface 3D porous micro/nanostructure superstructure of structured Cu-based film catalysts can not only enhance the dispersion of active metallic copper but also facilitate reactants to diffuse to more fully exposed surface adsorption/reaction sites on the interlaced nanosheets, in comparison with pure CuZnAl-LDH-derived powdered catalyst. As a result, the excellent instinct catalytic activity of Cu-4-F film catalyst is mainly correlated with the synergy between highly dispersive Cu species and favorable surface acidic sites originating from ZnAl-MMO component within surface active nanosheets, as well as the presence of abundant Cu-MMO interface, which can play important roles in promoting the FAL conversion and further transformation of FOL intermediate in the course of FAL hydrogenation. Further, the recyclability of Cu-4-F film catalyst was tested through successive eight runs. After the reaction, the structured catalyst may be directly taken out from the reactor, washed with ethanol, indicative of one of the most attractive characters in actual applications. As shown in Fig. 11 , after eight runs of reactions, the yield of FOL only slightly decreased. SEM images of used Cu-4-F catalyst (Fig. S9) reveal no change in the surface microstructure of film, while ICP-AES analysis for the filtrate shows negligible leaching of active Cu species. The results illustrate that the present film catalyst is extremely stable in terms to the chemical compositions and the structure, mainly attributable to the strong interactions between the substrate and surface Cu-containing active layer, thereby effectively suppressing the exfoliation of active layers from the substrate. In addition, the high stability of the film catalyst may be associated with the strong interactions between active copper species and ZnAl-MMO component within surface layer, which is beneficial for dispersing and stabilizing surface Cu species, thus avoiding the aggregation and leaching of Cu particles in the course of hydrogenation. In addition, as-fabricated structured Cu-4-F film catalyst exhibits good catalytic performance for the hydrogenation of different carbonyl compound substrates (Table 3 ), demonstrating that the present Cu-based catalyst is universal in selective hydrogenation of a variety of carbonyl compounds."
9,Conclusions,"In summary, the in-situ fabricated structured Cu-based film catalyst with surface porous 3D microstructure showed excellent catalytic performance for the FAL hydrogenation to FOL and CPO. In the process of structured catalyst precursor formation, Cu2+ species could uniformly distribute over the brucite-like lattice of Cu-containing LDH layers, thus leading to the high dispersion of metallic copper species strongly interacting with surface intercrossed ZnAl-MMO nanosheets bonded to the AAO/Al substrate. The Cu-based film catalyst with a Zn/Cu molar ratio of 1:4 delivered an almost complete conversion with the 100% selectivity to FOL at 100 °C and 2.0 MPa hydrogen pressure after a reaction of 3 h. Moreover, the catalyst also could give a 86.5% CPO yield at 140 °C after 2 h. Such high catalytic efficiency is mainly associated with high dispersive Cu species and favorable surface acidity, as well as strong interface interactions between Cu0 particles and ZnAl-MMO component within surface active nanosheets, which were mainly responsible for enhancing the conversion of FAL into FOL and CPO. Finally, the structured Cu-based film catalyst possessed good structural stability, owing to strong adhesion of in situ grown surface-active layers on the AAO/Al substrate, as well as strong interactions between active copper species and ZnAl-MMO component within the surface layer. Such type of highly efficient, stable and structured metal catalysts may be practically promising for a variety of industrially important catalytic processes."
