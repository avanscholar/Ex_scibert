0,Introduction,"The use of biomass as raw materials to produce hydrogen is one of the most interesting alternatives to the concern caused by both the decrease of non-renewable resources and the increasing global warming effect, because it is renewable and its consumption is almost neutral with respect to greenhouse gas emissions [1–3]. Hydrogen can be produced from oxygenated hydrocarbons via aqueous-phase reforming [4–7] or from other biomass feedstock via steam reforming and gasification [8–10]. Hydrogen production via steam reforming of alcohols such as methanol, ethanol or glycerol is very attractive since the reforming reaction can be performed using well-known technologies, conducted at atmospheric pressure and using conventional fixed-bed reactors. Significant amount of glycerol is obtained as a by-product in biodiesel production by transesterification of vegetable oils, which are available at low cost in large quantity from renewable raw materials. With increased production of biodiesel, an excess amount of glycerol is expected in the world market and this by-product could become a waste. With this perspective, the conversion of glycerol to hydrogen via steam reforming would be an interesting alternative as compare to other alcohols bringing in the following advantages: (i) the raw material is a renewable energy resource and (ii) the reduction in the biodiesel cost associated with the glycerol storage and management cost. However, steam reforming of glycerol involves complex reactions that results in several intermediates affecting the selectivity of the hydrogen and the most important difficulties presented by process are the high carbon formation rate [11,12]. Glycerol steam reforming is given by Eq. (1): (1) C3H8O3 (g) + 3H2O (g) → 3CO2 (g) + 7H2 (g) which may be viewed as the combination of Eqs. (2) and (3): (2) C3H8O3 (g) → 3CO (g) + 4H2 (g) (glycerol decomposition) and (3) CO (g) + H2O (g) ⇔ CO2 (g) + H2 (g) (Water Gas Shift reaction) In addition methanation and coke formation reactions are also possible according to the following processes: (4) CO (g) + 3H2 (g) ⇔ CH4 (g) + H2O (g) (5) CO2 (g) + 4H2 (g) ⇔ CH4 (g) + 2H2O (g) (6) CH4 (g) ⇔ H2 (g) + C (s) (7) CO2 (g) + H2 (g) ⇔ 2H2O (g) + C (s) (8) 2CO (g) ⇔ CO2 (g) + C (s) (Boudouard reaction) Pioneering work concerning reforming of glycerol and other biomass-derived polyalcohols in aqueous phase has been reported by Dumesic et al. [1]. Monometallic supported catalysts based on Ni, Pd, Pt, Ru, Rh and Ir have been studied for this process, being Pt and Pd-based the most effective. Bimetallic, Ni-, Pd- and Pt-based catalysts have been studied in the Aqueous Phase Reforming (APR) process. Ni-based catalysts are very active for APR but they are not stable under reaction conditions due to the production of significant amounts of alkanes. However, the catalytic activity of Ni-based catalyst is not modified by adding Sn [13]. Trimm [14] hypothesizes that the similar electronic structure of carbon and elements of groups IV and V of the periodic system may favor the interaction of these metals with Ni 3d electrons, thereby reducing the chance of nickel carbide formation. Although the formation of nickel carbide has been discarded as the initial step in the metal dusting process of nickel alloys [15], recent first-principle calculations on the adsorption of CO, OH, C and H on Ni3Sn surfaces has pointed out that the adsorption energy of these species depends on the presence of Sn as nearest or next-nearest neighbor of the nickel-atoms [16]. These results are in agreement with recent work by Nikolla et al. [17,18] that shows that the barrier for C–C bond formation increases with doping with tin Ni (111) and (211) surfaces. The nature of support influences the catalytic performance of supported Ni catalysts for the steam reforming of alcohols since it affects dispersion and stability of the metal, moreover, the support may participate in the reaction. Among supports, alumina-based supports are often used in reforming catalysts because their mechanical and chemical resistance under reaction conditions. Nevertheless the use of alumina as support promotes catalysts deactivation by deposition of carbon from ethylene intermediate produced via dehydration reactions of alcohols on acid sites of the supports. Thus, basic additives or promoters that favor water adsorption and OH surface mobility are usual in Al2O3 supports to neutralize its acidity and to decrease the rate of coke deposition on catalysts surfaces [19]. Alternatively, coking may be reduced by gasifying the deposited carbon species [20–22]. The modification of the support by adding alkaline components such as MgO, K2O [23] or lathanide oxides [24,25] favor the gasification of coke. The combination of adding a basic promoter and an alloying element of nickel catalysts must result in favoring coke resistant Ni catalyst for the steam reforming of hydrocarbons. This work is part of a wide study devoted to the design of catalyst for the steam reforming of biomass-derived fuels. We have studied previously a series of bimetallic Ni–Sn catalysts supported on magnesia-modified γ-Al2O3 in the methanol steam reforming [26]. In this paper, the same series of catalyst were evaluated in the glycerol steam reforming and the influence of the acid–base properties of the support on coke deposition was studied. The purpose is to increase hydrogen selectivity maximizing the CO2/CO ratio and minimizing coke deposition on the catalyst."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation and characterization,"2.1 Preparation and characterization A series of NiSn/MgO–Al2O3 catalysts containing a 15 wt.% NiSn loading with a Ni/Sn = 3 weight ratio and different MgO load (0, 5, 10 and 20 wt.%) were synthesized by the incipient wetness method. All solids were calcined at 700 °C for 12 h in flowing 0.1% NO x /He/10% H2O/synthetic air. The calcination process is performed in NO x atmosphere in order to obtain better dispersion of Ni particles [27]. The supports were named as 0MgAl, 5MgAl, 10MgAl and 30 MgAl according to their MgO load (wt.%), and similarly, the catalyst were referred as NiSn/0MgAl, NiSn/5MgAl; NiSn/10MgAl and NiSn/30MgAl. The characterization before catalytic test was performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and textural properties. The experimental details have been reported elsewhere [26]."
3,Pyridine adsorption,"2.2 Pyridine adsorption The surface acidity of the catalysts and supports was investigated by means of a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic (FT-IR) study of pyridine adsorption. Spectra of adsorbed pyridine were recorded on a Nicolet Avatar 380 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a DTGS detector. The samples were pressed into self supporting wafers, placed in a quartz IR cell and treated under vacuum (10−6 torr) at 600 °C for 1 h. After cooling at room temperature, the samples were exposed to subsequent doses of pyridine until surface saturation and spectra (128 scans, 2 cm−1 resolution) were recorded after addition of each one of the doses. The thermal stability of the formed species on the surface was also studied."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test The catalytic glycerol steam reforming was performed in a commercial computerized Microactivity Reference Catalytic Reactor from PiD Eng&Tech, employing a Hastelloy C-276 tubular reactor (Autoclave Engineers) with 9 mm internal diameter. Prior to reaction, the catalyst was reduced at 750 °C for 1 h in a 100 mL min−1 H2 (50 vol.% in inert) stream. The experimental runs were performed using a steam-to-carbon molar ratio of 4 and 100 L g−1 h−1 space velocity at 650 °C. The catalyst sample (0.1 g) was diluted with quartz (0.1 g) both with a particle size between 100 and 200 μm. Furthermore a blank test was carried out in order to analyze the effect of the diluent in the reaction. Gas products were analyzed on line using a μGC (Varian 4900) equipped with Porapak Q and MS-5A columns. Liquid products and glycerol not transformed were analyzed by HPLC (Varian 356-LC) equipped with a Refractive Index Detector."
5,Analytical methodology,"2.4 Analytical methodology The performance of the catalyst was evaluated in terms of total glycerol conversion, x (Eq. (9)), glycerol conversion into gaseous products, x gas phase (Eq. (10)), and glycerol conversion into liquids products, x liquid phase (Eq. (11)). These parameters were calculated based on the following equations: (9) x ( % ) = n C 3 H 8 O 3 in − n C 3 H 8 O 3 out n C 3 H 8 O 3 in × 100 (10) x gas phase ( % ) = n CO 2 + n CO + n CH 4 + n C 2 H 4 3 n C 3 H 8 O 3 in × 100 (11) x liquid phase ( % ) = ∑ i = 1 ( n i x i ) 3 n C 3 H 8 O 3 in × 100 where n i corresponding to moles of specie i and x i is the number of carbon atoms in the specie i. Hydrogen yield (%) has been calculated from (Eq. (12)): (12) H 2 yield ( % ) = H 2 moles produced maximum of moles of H 2 ( = 7 ) × 100"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Acid–base properties: adsorption of pyridine,"3.1 Acid–base properties: adsorption of pyridine In order to demonstrate the decrease of the acid properties of the support after MgO incorporation, a FT-IR study of pyridine adsorption on the prepared solids has been performed. Fig. 1 a shows the spectra of pyridine adsorption after saturation at room temperature on the considered supports. All bands observed are characteristic of pyridine adsorbed on Lewis acid centers of the solid; no evidences of Brönsted centers capable of adsorbing pyridine to form PyH+ species (characterized by IR bands at about 1540 cm−1) were detected. It is noteworthy that the introduction of MgO induces a decrease in the area of all bands, pointing out the diminution of the number of the Lewis acid sites in the support. In special, it is evident the loss of the band at 1622 cm−1 characteristic of pyridine adsorbed on Ia-type Al3+ tetracoordinated centers [28]. The disappearance of this band must be related with a decrease in the Lewis acidity of the solids after MgO incorporation. In the case of the NiSn catalysts (Fig. 1b), similar results and trends are obtained, however the acidity of the samples are lower than those of the corresponding supports, because the metallic cations are placed in the free positions of the spinel structure. In according to Hughes et al. [29], the concentration of Lewis acid sites in the supports and catalyst may be estimated from the Lambert–Beer law (Eq. (13)): (13) A = b · C Lewis ∫ e v d v where b is the ratio between mass and surface in the wafer, C Lewis is the concentration of Lewis acid sites, A is the absorbance of the band more intense and the integral corresponding to molar extinction coefficient. The absorbance may be calculated by integration of the band and the molar extinction coefficient is equal to 1.413 cm μmol−1. In Fig. 2 are represented the concentration of Lewis acid sites calculated for the supports and catalysts. It can be observed that the addition of MgO decreases the concentration of Lewis acid sites in all solids, and is lower in the catalyst than those supports. It is well known that the incorporation of MgO in the alumina structure provokes the formation of the MgAl2O4 spinel and modifies the acid–base properties, while that the introduction of metallic cations produces a saturation of the non-coordinated positions in the spinel structure [26,30]. In a previous work [26] we have investigated by XRD measurements the structural changes that are produced in the alumina support by addition of MgO directly affecting the surface composition of the catalysts, and the acid–base properties as a consequence. We have observed that for MgO contents lower than 28%, the coexistence of MgAl2O4 and NiAl2O4 spinels is possible, while if the MgO quantity is higher than this value, only the magnesium spinel is formed, remaining the excess of Mg and Ni in form of MgO–NiO solid solution, due to the high temperature of calcination and the complete miscibility of MgO and NiO phases. Furthermore, we have obtained information about the electronic states of active phases from XRD after of a reductive pretreatment. All catalysts presented structural modifications after of reduction at high temperature leading to the formation of Ni x Sn y alloys. The higher intensity of the XRD peaks of NiSn alloys for higher magnesium contents point to the preferential formation of MgAl2O4 spinel. Since the formation of this phase causes the increasing of the nickel species out of the structure (when the added nickel quantity increases), its combination with the tin is provided, generating the detected metallic alloy. This fact was also evidenced by the TPR profiles: the reduction peaks of nickel species increases in intensity for the highest MgO loading. In conclusion, we can achieve that the addition of MgO to alumina provokes structural modifications that affecting directly to the acid-basic properties decreasing the surface acidity of Al2O3."
8,Glycerol steam reforming,"3.2 Glycerol steam reforming Thermodynamic analyses predict that high temperatures, low pressures and high H2O/C molar ratios favor the hydrogen production. According to Adhikari et al. [31,32], the optimal conditions to produce hydrogen are temperatures higher than 627 °C and a 9:1 molar ratio of water to glycerol. Under these conditions, methane production is minimized and coke formation is inhibited. It is worth noting that water excess is beneficial because allows higher selectivities to hydrogen. Thus, in this work, the reaction tests were performed at 650 °C, water/glycerol molar ratio 12/1 and atmospheric pressure. Catalytic results are shown in Figs. 3 and 4 . It can be observed that the MgO addition favor the conversion to gaseous product and NiSn/30MgAl catalyst presented the highest and stable glycerol conversion. It should be noted that hydrogen production is notably increased when alumina is loaded with 5 wt.% of MgO, however only is slightly improved when the load of MgO is increased. The performance of the nickel-tin catalysts was improved with the addition of MgO, being the hydrogen production very similar between NiSn/10MgAl and NiSn/30MgAl and slightly lower for the NiSn/5MgAl. According to our previous work [26], the degree of nickel interaction with alumina may be modified in the presence of MgO by formation of MgAl2O4 species, which inhibits the incorporation of nickel in the Al2O3 phase thus improving Ni dispersion. Therefore, the lower performance detected for the NiSn/0MgAl may be attributed to the presence of NiAl2O4 in that solid, which provokes a decreasing of Ni0 sites (active sites) generated after the reductive pre-treatment. NiSn/30MgAl and NiSn/10MgAl catalysts show the highest hydrogen production due to the major fraction of reduced nickel (Ni0) in those samples. The blank experiment using quartz under the same operating conditions presented a glycerol conversion equal to 40% indicating that the quartz is not an inert material. Table 1 shows the molar composition in gas phase for all samples studied after 1 h reaction. Four catalysts presented a similar composition while that in the quartz is different. In according to Valliyappan et al. [33], in the range of temperature 650–800 °C occurs the pyrolysis of glycerol to gaseous fuel and other condensable products over a packed bed consisting of quartz or silicon carbide, and the gas composition obtained by these authors is analogous to the showed for the quartz in Table 1. In Figs. 3 and 4 are compared the conversion to product gaseous and hydrogen yield obtained in the quartz and the four catalysts. It should be noted that the mixture catalyst-quartz improves the conversion to gas and increases the hydrogen yield. On the other hand, Fig. 5 shows the production of condensable products in the quartz and the catalysts presenting the quartz a large production of liquids. Wu and Williams [34] investigated the pyrolysis-gasification of plastic waste with a double reactor, involving a first stage of pyrolysis and a second stage catalytic. In good agreement with theses authors our results suggest that pyrolysis takes place on the quartz and the products obtained are reformed in the catalyst. In absence of catalyst only the cracking of glycerol is possible and the liquids production is higher. In summary, we can achieve that both thermal decomposition and catalytic reforming reactions take place during the steam reforming of oxygenates. The decomposition involves both thermal cracking reactions prior to entering the catalyst bed and the acid-base catalyzed reactions at the acidic and basic sites of the catalyst support."
9,Relationship between catalytic activity and acid–base properties,"3.3 Relationship between catalytic activity and acid–base properties For understanding the effect of Mg in the acid–base properties of the catalysts, from Fig. 6 is compared the number of Lewis acid centers with the glycerol conversion after 1 h of reaction as a function of MgO loading. It is observed that glycerol conversion to gas increase and liquids production decrease when the content of MgO is increased, while that total conversion is almost the same in all samples. In Table 2 are presented the liquids composition expressed in wt.% dry bass and without the glycerol not transformed. That product distribution can be explained according to the scheme proposed by Dumesic and Simonetti [35], where the conversion of glycerol to hydrogen takes place through the formation of a variety of chemical intermediates, such as alcohols and ketones. In Fig. 7 the involved reactions in the glycerol steam reforming are illustrated schematically, including the values of ΔG o and ΔH o at 250 °C. One can see that dehydrogenation reactions of glycerol to dihydrixoxyacetone and glyceraldehyde have small values of ΔG o, and the successive transformation to lactic acid and its reduction to propanediol are favorable (ΔG o = −24 kcal/mol and (ΔG o = −1 kcal/mol), therefore, all mentioned species may be present during catalytic processing. Alternatively, as shown in Fig. 7, the conversion to propanediol may take place first by dehydration to 2-hydroxy-2-propenol ((ΔG o = −15 kcal/mol) and to hydroxyacetone ((ΔG o = −9 kcal/mol). In a following step, the CC or CO double bonds can then be hydrogenated to produce propanediol ((ΔG o = −3 kcal/mol). This path for conversion of glycerol to propanediol could be performed over bi-functional catalysts, containing acid or basic sites to achieve dehydration and metal sites to facilitate hydrogenation reactions. In Table 2 is observed that production of acetone and propanediol is increased with the %MgO loading, and decreased the production of dihydroxyacetone. These results pointing out that basic sites favors the propanediol formation route from hydroxyacetone, and the hydrogenation of propanediol to acetone. Furthermore, from Fig. 7 it may be observed the formation route of synthesis gas (CO and H2), which is highly endothermic and is favorable to high temperature. As is observed in Fig. 6, gas conversion is increased with the decrease in the number of Lewis acid sites, which indicates that the basic sites favor the route to synthesis gas formation. Accordingly, the production of synthesis gas from glycerol must be operated at high concentrations of water and/or over catalyst that facilitate the water-gas shift reaction, and for this a high molar water:glycerol (12:1) ratio was used. In order to investigate the effect of catalyst in the WGS reaction, Yixin Lian et al. [36] have studied the effect of MgO in the water gas-shift reaction in function of temperature and the loading of MgO, and its have reported that at low temperatures the CO conversion increases rapidly with the content of MgO, but at high temperatures the conversion as a function of temperature were rather smooth, suggesting that less influence of MgO on WGS activity of the catalysts was observed at higher temperature. Therefore, the MgO is beneficial for the WGS reaction but at high temperature the effect is minimized since this reaction is exothermic and equilibrium is displaced to CO production. Other liquids such as methanol, ethanol, acrolein, acetic acid and propanol are also identified. For explaining the presence of these products from Fig. 8 are represented the routes proposed by Gandarias et al. [37]. Acrolein is the most abundant chemical of all products corresponding to that route, and methanol and ethanol were only identified in the quartz. It has been reported that the addition of basic metal oxide results in the gasification of carbonaceous species [23]. The carbon deposition can be mainly originated from three different manners: CH4 decomposition, CO disproportionation and the polymerization of unsaturated carbonaceous species such as C2H4, C2H4O and their fragments. The presence of acid sites induces dehydration reactions of adsorbed dehydrogenated fragments and consequently, unsaturated compounds increase. Therefore, the production of ethylene indicates the loss of the C–C bond breaking capacity provoking the coke formation. Fig. 9 shows the rate of ethylene formation in all samples investigated. It can be observed that the flow of produced ethylene in the quartz is unchanged indicating that the C2H4 is generated by thermal decomposition of glycerol while that in all the catalysts was increased up to reach the steady state. It should be noted that the addition of MgO decreases the rate of formation of ethylene; however, the catalyst with higher MgO loading increases rapidly the rate formation. The addition of low MgO loading lead to MgAl2O4 spinel formation favoring a high dispersion of the active phase (Ni metallic) and strong interaction with the support, and therefore facilitating the carbonaceous species gasification and decreasing the formation of ethylene. On the contrary, a higher MgO loading induces the formation of MgO layer over the MgAl2O4 spinel phase and produces an agglomeration of free Ni species that is responsible for coke formation. Fig. 10 displays a schematic representation of the influence of Mg in the catalytic performance. In the catalyst NiSn/0MgAl is formed the NiAl2O4 spinel and the number of acid sites is very high, which its provoke the secondary reaction of liquids formation. In the case of NiSn/10MgAl a surface layer of MgAl2O4 and the nickel particles are highly dispersed with a strong interaction with the MgAl2O4. For MgO content of 30%, one layer of MgO is formed over MgAl2O4 and nickel is dissolved in the MgO–NiO solid solution. In that case, interaction between support and active phase is weak and Ni is sintered. These results are agreement with the study realized by Koo et al. [38], which have reported an optimal MgO promotion for minimize the coke production in a series of catalysts Ni/Al2O3–MgO for the CO2 reforming of methane. In summary, the promotion of MgO on NiSn/Al2O3 catalysts for glycerol steam reforming decreases the concentration of Lewis acid centers and suppresses the secondary reactions that lead to liquids formation. With low MgO content (0–5 wt.% MgO), inactive NiAl2O4 spinel is formed and acid sites are present, which results in coke formation. On the contrary, agglomeration of nickel is responsible for coke formation with 30 wt.% MgO. The optimal content of MgO is 10 wt.%, which is the catalyst that exhibits better hydrogen production and higher conversion into gas phase with a lower coke formation."
10,Conclusions,"Hydrogen production from glycerol steam reforming was investigated over NiSn supported catalysts on xMgO-Al2O3 (x = 0, 5, 10 and 30 wt.%). Characterization of the catalysts showed that the modification of alumina support by addition of MgO directly affects the surface composition of the catalysts, and the acid–base properties are modified. With increasing MgO loadings, a decreasing of the surface acidity of Al2O3 was deduced from FT-IR of adsorbed pyridine. The decrease in the number of acid centers avoids the secondary reactions that lead to liquids intermediates. When the deactivation occurs the formation of ethylene is observed, indicating the loss of the C–C bond breaking capacity, and may be due to the formation of unsaturated compounds or the sintering of active phase. The catalyst NiSn/10MgAl exhibited the best catalytic activity and gas conversion with a lower coke formation. This is mainly due to the low concentration of acidic centers and strong interaction Ni–MgAl2O4, which favored the dispersion."
