0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is an important basic chemical and industrial gas as well as special gas, which has a wide range of applications in petrochemical industry, electronics industry, metallurgical industry, food processing, manufacture of float glass, synthesis of fine organic chemicals, aerospace, and other industries [1–3]. Considering worsening environmental challenges such as shortages of fossil fuels and climate change with an associated sea level rise, hydrogen is also an ideal secondary energy source because of its high calorific value of combustion, pollution-free combustion, and established production process [4–7]. Hydrogen can potentially contribute to a strategy for sustainable progress, which can only be achieved when global development resonates with the environment [8]. As a favorable candidate for new energy, the production, storage, transportation, and application of hydrogen should receive the appropriate attention including research efforts [9–12]. As a part of such efforts, studies on hydrogen detection and the determination of its concentration are required, since hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless flammable gas with a considerable explosion hazard and cannot be detected by human senses [13–15]. Consequently, high performance hydrogen sensors should be developed to detect and monitor hydrogen leaks. In recent years, catalytic sensors, thermal conductivity measurements, electrochemical sensors, optical sensors, metallic sensors, and semiconducting metal-oxide sensors have been used to accurately detect the presence of hydrogen [1]. Among them, metal-oxide gas sensors have been widely investigated since the 1960s due to their low cost, ease of use, scalability, and high sensitivity [16–18]. As such a metal-oxide sensor material, indium oxide (In2O3) is a semiconducting metal oxide with a wide bandgap of 3.6 eV at room temperature, which is widely applied in gas sensing due to its good conductivity and high stability [19–21]. Good sensing properties have been reported using In2O3 nanostructures to detect carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ethanol, methane, and hydrogen [22–25]. Li et al. [26] reported that mesoporous In2O3 showed a response of 18.0–500 ppm H2 with a response time of 1.7 s and a recovery time of 1.5 s at 260 °C. Qurashi et al. [27] reported that In2O3 nanowires showed a response of 0.1% for 500 ppm H2 with a response and recovery time of 31 s and 80 s, respectively, at 200 °C. However, the responses of the In2O3-based hydrogen gas sensors in these previous investigations were very low while the optimum operating temperatures remained high. Therefore, a hydrogen gas sensor with higher response, faster response and recovery time, and lower operating temperature is required. Several strategies have been followed to enhance the hydrogen sensing performance, such as doping with noble metals [28–30], decoration with transition metal oxides [31–33], and the formation of heterostructures [34–36]. Due to the substantial improvement in sensing performance achieved by these strategies, researchers have investigated the effects of a wide range of materials used for doping or the construction of heterostructures [37]. According to published studies, palladium oxide (PdO) contributes considerably to the improvement of sensor material in hydrogen detection [38–40]. Moschogiannaki et al. [41] reported for 1 wt% PdO-decorated p-type CoV2O6 nanoparticles a response of 114 for 30,000 ppm H2 with a response time of 17 s at 300 °C which is better than undecorated CoV2O6. Inyawilert et al. [42] demonstrated a response of 3526 for 10,000 ppm H2 with a response time of 2 s at 250 °C using 0.50 wt% PdO-decorated In2O3 nanoparticles, while the undoped In2O3 exhibited a response of 1582 with a response time of 5 s for the same H2 concentration under the same conditions. Furthermore, the ability of nickel oxide (NiO) to decrease the response and recovery time of gas sensors used for hydrogen detection has been discovered [43,44]. Wang et al. [45] reported for p-NiO/n-SnO2 heterojunction composite nanofibers a response of 3 for 5 ppm H2 with both a response and recovery time of about 3 s at 320 °C. Kamal et al.[46] have found that NiO-decorated graphene showed a response of 52.4% for 2000 ppm H2 at 200 °C. However, regardless of PdO-decoration or NiO-decoration, the existing requirements for hydrogen sensing could not be fully satisfied in the mentioned studies, since either the operating temperature is too high or the response is too low. With the aim to investigate methods to improve the sensing performance of hydrogen sensors, we found through literature research that sensing performance could be significantly improved by loading a combination of two materials compared to loading with either of them [47,48]. Since mono-doping could not meet our requirements for high performance hydrogen sensing, the synergistic effect of co-doping has been used to achieve our goals in this research. In this work, a hydrogen gas sensor with excellent sensing performance was successfully fabricated based on PdO and NiO co-doped In2O3 nanotubes. First, NiO-doped In2O3 nanotubes were prepared by electrospinning, and then PdO was loaded on the NiO-In2O3 nanotubes by impregnation under UV irradiation to form the final co-doped In2O3 nanotubes. The obtained sensor demonstrated an ultrahigh response, fast response time, low operating temperature, and high selectivity towards hydrogen. The underlying enhanced sensing mechanism was discussed in detail."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemicals and materials,"2.1 Chemicals and materials In(NO3)3·4.5H2O was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China), Ni(NO3)2·6H2O from Tianjin Kemiou Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Tianjin China), PdCl2 from Shenyang Keda Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shenyang China), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) from Rionlon BoHua (Tianjin) Pharmaceutical & Chemical Co., Ltd (Tianjin, China), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, MW ≈ 130,0000) from Sigma-Aldrich Inc. (USA), and ethylcellulose and α-terpineol were purchased from Alfa-Aesar Inc. (USA). The above chemical reagents were analytical grade or higher quality and used without further purification."
3,Synthesis of NiO/In2O3 heterojunctions,"2.2 Synthesis of NiO/In2O3 heterojunctions NiO/In2O3 heterojunctions were prepared by electrospinning employing the following preparation process. First, 0.4 g In(NO3)3·4.5H2O and 22.79 mg Ni(NO3)2·6H2O were added to a mixture of 5 mL DMF and 5 mL ethanol under vigorous stirring. After the metal salts were completely dissolved, 0.68 g PVP was added followed by magnetically stirring for 8 h at room temperature to attain sufficient viscosity required for electrospinning. The obtained precursor solution was loaded into a plastic syringe. In a typical electrostatic spinning process, the solution was delivered at a constant flow rate of 0.4 mL·h−1, the distance from the needle tip to the collector was 15 cm, and a voltage of 15 kV was applied. The obtained fibers were annealed in air at 600 °C for 2 h with a rate of 3 °C·min−1 and then allowed to cool to room temperature to obtain the final NiO/In2O3 nanotubes. For comparison, pure In2O3 nanotubes were also fabricated by using the same method without adding Ni(NO3)2·6H2O."
4,Synthesis of PdO/NiO/In2O3 heterojunctions,"2.3 Synthesis of PdO/NiO/In2O3 heterojunctions To form a PdO/NiO/In2O3 heterojunction, 10 mg NiO/In2O3 nanotubes were added to 20 mL deionized water and sonicated until the NiO/In2O3 nanotubes were uniformly suspended. Then, an aqueous solution of PdCl2 (2.5 mmol L−1) was added to the above suspension and subjected to UV irradiation by a 16 W UV lamp at 254 nm for 5 h. At a rate of 8000 r·min−1, the mixture was centrifuged for 7 min, the supernatant was removed and deionized water was added followed by further centrifugation for 5 min; this procedure was repeated using alcohol instead of water in the second cycle. After drying at 80 °C overnight, the PdO/NiO/In2O3 heterojunction material was obtained. PdO/In2O3 nanotubes were also fabricated by the same method for comparison."
5,Fabrication of gas sensors and gas detection measurement,"2.4 Fabrication of gas sensors and gas detection measurement All prepared samples were respectively mixed with an appropriate amount of 10 wt% ethylcellulose in α-terpineol as organic binder and uniformly printed to the surface of a ceramic tube equipped with a pair of Au electrodes and four Pt pins. Then, the as-printed tubes were dried at 80 °C and annealed at 400 °C in a tubular furnace to remove organic residues. To form a sensor, the ceramic tubes were welded on a hexapod arrangement attached to a base, and a Ni-Cr wire coil was used as a heater to control the operating temperature by changing the heating current, as shown in Fig. S1. The gas-sensing performance of the device was measured by using a WS-30B gas-sensing instrument (Wei-Sheng Electronics Co., Ltd., Zhengzhou, China). In a typical measurement process, the sensor was placed in an 18 L test chamber, which was initially filled with air, and then a certain concentration of target gas was injected into the chamber with a syringe. For a required concentration, the volume of the injected gas ( V ) can be calculated as follows: (1) V = V 0 × C / C 0 where C is the desired concentration of the target gas; V 0 is the volume of the test chamber; and C 0 is the concentration of the target gas in the bottled gas. In the test chamber, two electric fans were installed to speed up the gas dispersion and obtain a homogeneous test gas mixture. After the detection step, the chamber was opened to introduce air and allow for sensor recovery. As In2O3 is a typical n-type semiconductor and hydrogen is a reducing gas, the sensitivity is defined as: S = R a / R g , where R a and R g are the resistances of the sensors when testing in air and the target gas atmospheres, respectively. Furthermore, the response time is defined as the time for a 90% change in resistance after exposure to the target gas, and the recovery time is defined as the time, after re-exposure to air, for a change in resistance to 90% of the initial resistance value."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization The crystal structure of the material and its components were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Philips X’ Pert Pro, Cu Kα, λ = 1.5418 Å). The morphology and structure of the materials were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Tescan Lyra3), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM, FEI Tecnai 200S). The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis was performed with the TEM attachment. The elemental composition and chemical states of the materials were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250 using Al as the excitation source)."
7,Results and discussions,"The XRD patterns of pure In2O3 and doped In2O3 samples are presented in Fig. 1 . The main peaks located at 21 . 5 ° , 30 . 6 ° , 35 . 5 ° , 41 . 8 ° , 45 . 7 ° , 51 . 1 ° , 56 . 1 ° , and 60 . 6 ° are corresponding to the (211), (222), (400), (332), (431), (440), (611), and (622) lattice planes, respectively, which match well with cubic-phase In2O3 (JCPDS card 06-0416). In the case of the doped samples, no characteristic peak assigned to PdO or NiO could be observed, which might be attributed to the PdO- and NiO-concentrations being below the detection limit of the XRD instrument. However, the effect of doping with PdO and NiO on the crystal structure of pure In2O3 is reflected in the different lattice constants calculated from the XRD peaks, as shown in Fig. S2. SEM images of pure In2O3, NiO-In2O3, PdO-In2O3, and PdO/NiO-In2O3 are shown in Fig. 2 a-d, respectively. Fig. 2a indicates that the produced pure In2O3 exhibits a typical nanotube structure, and NiO-In2O3, PdO-In2O3, and PdO/NiO-In2O3 show a nanotube morphology similar to that of pure In2O3, as evident from Fig. 2b-d. However, after doping, the morphology of In2O3 slightly changed. The average diameter of pure In2O3 nanotubes is 92 nm, while PdO-In2O3 nanotubes are with a diameter of 95 nm slightly wider than the pure sample. The average diameters of NiO-In2O3 nanotubes and PdO/NiO-In2O3 nanotubes are 199 nm and 211 nm, respectively, which are much larger compared to pure In2O3 and PdO-In2O3. The TEM images of PdO/NiO-In2O3 nanotubes in Fig. 3 a suggest that this material is composed of nanoparticles like the other samples as shown in Fig. S3. The HRTEM image of PdO/NiO-In2O3 including lattice information is shown in Fig. 3b-c. The lattice distances of 0.283 nm, 0.238 nm, and 0.409 nm correspond to the (200) plane of PdO, (111) plane of NiO, and (211) plane of In2O3. Fig. 3d-h displays the STEM image and elemental scanning results of PdO/NiO-In2O3, confirming the presence of O, In, Pd, and Ni elements and their uniform distribution. The analysis of the XPS spectrum of Pd 3d and Ni 2p in PdO/NiO-In2O3 is presented in Fig. 4 and reveals two major peaks centered at 336.90 eV and 342.22 eV, corresponding to Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2, respectively, and indicating the presence of Pd 2 + state in PdO/NiO-In2O3. In Fig. 4b, the peaks centered at 855.07 eV and 872.59 eV correspond to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively, indicating the occurrence of Ni atoms in the Ni 2 + state in the same material. The analyses demonstrate that PdO and NiO were successfully doped on In2O3 nanotubes. The hydrogen gas sensing properties of the four materials were studied in detail. As operating temperature is one of the most significant parameters of metal-oxide semiconductor gas sensors, the response of the sensors constructed with pure In2O3, PdO-In2O3, NiO-In2O3, and PdO/NiO-In2O3 was tested at different temperatures to obtain the optimal operating temperature. Fig. 5 a illustrates the responses of these sensors to 5 ppm H2 in the temperature range of 160–300 °C. The response to hydrogen of the In2O3-based sensor is low ( S max = 1.79 at 300 °C) and does not change significantly with increasing temperature, which is similar to the behavior of the NiO-In2O3 gas sensor ( S max = 2.48 at 300 °C). However, with the doping of PdO, the hydrogen gas sensing of In2O3 was substantially improved. Firstly, the PdO-In2O3 and PdO/NiO-In2O3 sensors demonstrated a higher response than the In2O3 sensor at all test temperatures as well as a significant reduction in the optimum operating temperature to 160 °C as the lowest temperature in the investigated temperature range. Secondly, while the response of the PdO-In2O3 gas sensor to 5 ppm hydrogen at 160 °C is improved to 16.21, the response of PdO/NiO-In2O3 reaches a remarkable value of 487.52. Importantly, due to the limitations of the test equipment, the lowest operating temperature of the sensor is limited to 160 °C, and the optimum operating temperature of the PdO-decorated sensors may be achieved at even lower temperatures. Fig. 5b presents the gas response in dependence of the hydrogen concentration between 0.1 and 5 ppm at their respective optimal operating temperatures, and the inset is an enlargement of the response for concentrations between 0.1 and 0.5 ppm. The curves of pure In2O3 and NiO-In2O3 are nearly identical, implying that the addition of NiO does not significantly enhance the response of In2O3 to hydrogen. After doping with PdO, the response of In2O3 nanotubes and NiO-In2O3 nanotubes to hydrogen has been significantly improved, and a lower detection limit of these sensors has been found. The detailed dynamic response-recovery curves of PdO/NiO-In2O3 at 160 °C are shown in Fig. 6 a-f. The sensor responds significantly even at a hydrogen concentration of 0.1 ppm. Due to equipment limitations, we have not tested the response of the sensor at lower hydrogen concentrations, but we believe that its detection limit is below 0.1 ppm. Next to the sensitivity of gas sensors, their response and recovery time is an important indicator of gas sensing performance. Fig. 7 presents the response and recovery times of the four materials to 5 ppm hydrogen at 160 °C for comparison. Dynamic response and recovery sensing curves of pure and doped In2O3 nanotubes are shown in Fig. S4. The observed response times of pure In2O3 and NiO-doped In2O3 samples are 153 s and 97 s, respectively, while after doping with PdO the response time of both pure In2O3 and NiO-doped In2O3 nanotubes are reduced by ~99% to 1 s, which indicates an acceleration in the rate of hydrogen adsorption by PdO doping. However, the addition of PdO did not result in a reduction of the recovery time as evident from the increase of the recovery time from 232 s for pure In2O3 to 674 s for PdO-In2O3. However, the doping with NiO improved the recovery performance of the sensors. As shown in Fig. 7, the recovery time of NiO-In2O3 nanotubes and PdO/NiO-In2O3 nanotubes of 168 s and 336 s are reduced by 27.6% and 50.1% compared to In2O3 and PdO-In2O3, respectively. In practical applications, the exclusion of the interference of other gases and the sole response to one specific gas are important for a gas sensor. Fig. 8 shows the response at 160 °C of the four gas sensors to 5 ppm H2 and to 100 ppm of selected typical interfering gases. It should be highlighted that, compared to other materials, PdO/NiO-In2O3 nanotubes showed a ultrahigh response to 5 ppm hydrogen at 160 °C but almost no response to other interfering gases, indicating an excellent hydrogen selectivity. In addition, cycle repeatability and long-term stability are two important properties that affect the practical applications of sensors. As shown in Fig. 9 a, the dynamic response-recovery curves of PdO/NiO-In2O3 nanotubes were determined in the detection of 5 ppm H2 at 160 °C for five cycles with the result that the response of the sensor remained almost constant. For the same concentration and operating temperature, the long-term stability of PdO/NiO-In2O3 was tested over 30 days, which remained stable as shown in Fig. 9b and reveals the potential for monitoring hydrogen in practical applications. Table 1 lists the hydrogen responses of previously reported Pd/PdO-decorated In2O3 sensors in comparison with the PdO/NiO-In2O3 materials studied in this investigation. Of the materials published previously, the best response is demonstrated by Pd-functionalized In2O3-loaded ZnO nanofibers reported by Lee et al. [54] with a response of 114 to 5 ppm H2 at 350 °C. In comparison, the sensor of this work reaches a significantly higher response of 487.52 at the same H2 concentration and at a lower temperature. Furthermore, the lowest working temperature of the listed materials is with 200 °C [51] higher than in this work. Therefore, comparing to previous research, the prepared PdO/NiO-In2O3 nanotubes exhibited the best response to hydrogen and the lowest working temperature, indicating that the co-doping of PdO and NiO provides In2O3 nanotubes with excellent hydrogen sensing characteristics. As In2O3 is a typical n-type metal-oxide semiconductor, its hydrogen sensor mechanism could be explained by the change in resistance caused by the adsorption and desorption of the gas molecules on the surface. As shown in Fig. 10 a, when exposed to air atmosphere, the surface of In2O3 nanotubes adsorbs oxygen molecules in the forms of O 2 - , O - , and O 2 - at different working temperatures [49]. In this adsorption process, oxygen traps electrons from the conduction band of In2O3 nanotubes resulting in the formation of an electron depletion layer on the surface of the material, which induces a high-resistance state of the sensor. The adsorbed oxygen will react with hydrogen on its introduction and will be replaced by hydrogen, releasing electrons to the conduction band of In2O3 nanotubes and leading to a reduction of the resistance of the sensor, as shown in Fig. 10b. When re-exposed to air, the surface of In2O3 nanotubes becomes occupied by oxygen molecules, and the sensor returns to its initial high-resistance state. The above process could be expressed by the following equations: (2) O 2 + 2 e - → 2 O - (3) H 2 + O - → H 2 O + e - (4) 4 H + + O 2 + 4 e - → 2 H 2 O After doping with PdO and NiO, the co-doped In2O3 nanotubes show a very high response towards hydrogen, which mechanism might be explained as follows. Based on the analysis shown in Fig. 4, Pd and Ni are present in PdO/NiO-In2O3 nanotubes in the form of Pd 2 + and Ni 2 + . When PdO and NiO, which are both p-type metal-oxide semiconductors, are contacted with the n-type semiconductor In2O3, p-n heterojunctions are generated resulting in the formation of charge depletion layers in the nanotubes. The adsorbed oxygen can completely reduce the remaining charge and react according to equation (2), causing a great reduction in the sensor resistance, as shown in Fig. 11 . The definition of the gas sensor response ( S = R a / R g ) implies that a higher resistance of the sensor in air will result in a higher response. Compared to PdO-In2O3 nanotubes, the co-doping of PdO and NiO provides more p-n heterojunctions resulting in a greater increase in the initial resistance of In2O3 nanotubes and consequently in a greater increase in response. In addition, the presence of PdO causes a chemical sensitization effect on adsorption of hydrogen, resulting in a homogenous split of H2 to hydrogen atoms followed by a spill-over to the In2O3 nanotubes [40]. Through this process, more hydrogen is adsorbed, and the rate of its reaction with oxygen is increased facilitating the process of Eq. (3) and leading to a lower resistance of In2O3 nanotubes when exposed to hydrogen. Because of the definition of the sensor response, a lower resistance of sensors in hydrogen results in a higher response. Since NiO has a catalytic effect on oxygen adsorption facilitating the process of Eq. (4), the recovery time is shortened, and the gas-sensitivity performance of the sensor is enhanced. Towards hydrogen, however, NiO does not exhibit a significant chemical sensitization effect and does not contribute to increasing the hydrogen response and the response rate when doped on In2O3 nanotubes. The schematic diagram of the sensing mechanism of PdO/NiO-In2O3 is presented in Fig. 10c-d."
8,Conclusions,"In this work, In2O3 nanotube material co-doped with PdO and NiO was prepared and its hydrogen gas sensing performance was investigated. Compared to pure or mono-doped In2O3 nanotube samples, the Pd-Ni co-doped material exhibited an ultrahigh response of 487.52, a fast response time of 1 s, and high hydrogen selectivity in a 5 ppm hydrogen-air gas mixture at a sensor operating temperature of 160 °C. In addition, it demonstrated a considerable long-term stability, offering the possibility of the sensors to be used in practice. The enhancement of the gas sensing performance was ascribed to the resistance modulation based on the chemical sensitization effect of PdO on hydrogen adsorption and the catalytic effect of NiO on oxygen adsorption. This work demonstrates that co-doping of PdO and NiO on In2O3 nanotubes constitutes an effective way to improve hydrogen sensing performance and provides a material for potential application in the detection of hydrogen."
