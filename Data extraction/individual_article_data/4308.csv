0,Introduction,"Pervaporation (PV) has been established to be an efficient membrane separation process for azeotropic mixtures and close-boiling point liquid mixtures. Its separation efficiency largely depends on the membrane. The pervaporation membrane must show good stability in organic solvents while giving a reasonable permeability and selectivity. Polymeric membranes have still been a choice for industrial pervaporation applications and are still developing [1]. Hydrophilic polymers such as chitosan [2–4], sodium alginate [5–7], and poly(vinyl alcohol) [8–11] have been widely researched for pervaporation. A typical problem encountered in this type of hydrophilic PV membranes is swelling and to prevent it the membrane must be cross-linked or introduce fillers that can enhance the stability. A nanomaterial, as a filler, that possess hydrophilic groups is a good candidate as it may serve as carrier for water permeation and also provide good compatibility with the hydrophilic polymer used [5,7,12]. Therefore, it is still essential to evaluate new emerging materials that could potentially augment the separation efficiency of PV membranes. Graphene oxide (GO), which is a 2D carbon-based nanomaterial has been extensively studied in different separation processes such as pervaporation [3–5,7,13], gas separation [14,15], nanofiltration [16,17], and reverse osmosis [18,19]. This unique material has hydrophilic regions that easily attracts water and hydrophobic regions that resembles graphene and serves as a frictionless pathway for water molecules. In our previous works on pervaporation, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in chitosan membranes exhibited an effective methanol/water separation performance [4] and the GO with minute amounts of PVA showed good stability and separation of acetic acid/water mixture [13]. The separation in these membranes was mainly due to the interlayer space of GO sheets. GO has a large lateral dimension (~1 µm) that provides a long-tortuous path for the permeating molecules. Thus modifying graphene sheets with artificial pores has been reported to effectively enhance the permeation [20,21] but this additional process provides additional cost and impractical for large-scale production. A possible way to enhance the permeation is to find a material that has a smaller lateral size but possess similar structure as GO. Currently, researchers are focused on utilizing graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs). GOQD is an emerging nanomaterial and has been widely used in fields such as biomedical [22–24], sensors [25–27], and electronics [28,29] due to its biocompatibility and optical properties. GOQDs possess a few-layer of graphene sheets with a lateral size of less than 100 nm. GOQDs have the similar sp2 carbon structure and hydrophilic functional groups as GO but is contained in a very small size. Hence, shorter tortuous pathway for permeating molecule is expected. Membranologists are recently utilizing quantum dots as an additive to enhance the membrane performance for various separation process like nanofiltration [30,31], forward osmosis [32] and pressure retarded osmosis [33]. Therefore, GOQD is a good candidate as an additive for membrane fabrication to enhance the hydrophilic character. It is expected that the GOQDs within the polymer matrix would attract water molecules and augment the separation of alcohol/water mixtures. Compared to GO, the synthesis of GOQDs is easier. A facile “bottom-up” approach was used in this study to synthesize GOQDs through the partial carbonization of citric acid (CA) by moderate pyrolysis [34]. The GOQDs were integrated in poly(vinyl alcohol), a good film-forming polymer and industrially used for PV, to prepare composite membranes. The effect of integrating GOQDs on the membrane physicochemical property was characterized and the dehydration performance was evaluated."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Citric acid anhydrous (CA) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) pellets were purchased from SHOWA Chemical Industry Co., Ltd (Japan). Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA, MW 146,000–186,000, 99+% hydrolyzed) and Glutaraldehyde (25% in water) were from Sigma Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Methanol (HPLC grade) was acquired from Aencore Chemical Pty. Ltd. (Victoria, Australia). Hydrochloric acid (HCl) was obtained from Nihon Shiyaku Reagent (Japan). Isopropanol (i-PrOH), n-propanol (n-PrOH), ethanol (EtOH), n-butanol (n-BuOH), and t-butanol (t-BuOH) were all from Echo Chemical Co., Ltd. (Taiwan). The polysulfone (PSf) support membranes were provided by R&D Center for Membrane Technology (Taiwan)."
3,Synthesis of GOQDs and membrane fabrication,"2.2 Synthesis of GOQDs and membrane fabrication GOQDs were synthesized through the partial carbonization of citric acid (CA) through moderate pyrolysis following the method of Dong et al. [34] with slight modification. Briefly, 2 g of CA was placed in a 100 mL glass bottle immersed in an oil bath at 200 °C. The CA was liquefied and after 30 min it turned into an orange solution signifying the formation GOQDs. The orange solution was then neutralized to pH 7.0 by adding a drop by drop amount of it in a 100 mL of 10 mg mL-1 NaOH solution under vigorous stirring. The resulting aqueous dispersion was dialyzed using a CelluSep H1 dialysis tube with a MWCO of 2000 Da from Membrane Filtration Products Inc (Senguin, Texas, USA). The GOQD was kept in refrigerator at 4 °C until use. The PVA membranes with GOQDs or hybrid membranes were prepared on an air-dried PSf support membrane by solution casting method. The GOQDs at different concentrations (100, 300, and 500 ppm) were first dispersed in deionized water by sonication for 30 min. Followed by dissolving PVA into the GOQD suspension to make 4 wt% polymer solution at 90 °C for 12 h under vigorous stirring. After filtration to remove undissolved substance the casting solution was cooled at room temperature. The casting solution was cross-linked by maintaining the molar ratio of glutaraldehyde to PVA at 0.2 [35]. A certain amount of 10 wt% methanol and HCl was added as the quencher and catalyst, respectively. The resulting cross-linked casting solution was cast on the PSf support membrane using a 200 µm casting knife. The solvent was allowed to evaporate at 60 °C for 2 h in an oven followed by vacuum-drying at room temperature for 12 h to remove excess solvent and moisture. The membranes were named as PVAx-GOQDn, in which the “x” denotes cross-linked membranes and n (= 100, 300, 500) represents the GOQD concentration in ppm. Uncross-linked PVA and PVAx membranes without GOQDs were prepared for comparison. Homogeneous free-standing membranes were also prepared in glass plates with similar conditions described earlier for characterization."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM- 2100) was used to characterize the size of the synthesized GOQD. The GOQD aqueous suspension was sonicated for 30 min and dropped onto a copper grid with carbon mesh followed by vacuum drying before TEM testing. The crystallinity of the membranes and GOQDs were characterized through X-ray diffraction (XRD, Model D8 Advance Eco, Bruker) at a scan range of 5° ≤ 2θ ≤ 60°. The height profile and chemical composition of GOQDs was analyzed using an atomic force microscope (AFM, Bruker) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS, Thermo Scientific, K-Alpha), respectively. The GOQDs aqueous suspension was dropped on a silicon wafer then dried before AFM and XPS testing. Chemical structure of the membranes and GOQDs was acquired using a Fourier-transform infrared spectroscope (FTIR, Spectrum One, Perkin Elmer) while the cross-section morphology of the membranes was captured with field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Model S-4800 SEM, Hitachi). The membranes were freeze-fractured in liquid nitrogen then placed on the sample stage and coated with platinum using before FESEM testing. The static water contact angle was obtained for the surface hydrophilicity analysis of the membrane using a contact angle testing instrument (WCA, Model PV-DP, Face Kyowa Interface Science). The swelling degree test was done by using the free-standing homogeneous membranes pre-vacuum dried to remove moisture followed by measuring their weight. The membranes were soaked in various concentration (10–90 wt%) of i-PrOH for 24 h at 25 °C. After soaking, the residual solvent on the membrane was removed using delicate wipes. Then the membranes were weighed immediately. The swelling degree (SD, %) was calculated by the following equation: (1) SD = W S − W D W D × 100 % where W S and W D is the weight of the swollen and dried membranes, respectively. Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) was performed to characterize the free volume measurements of the membrane in dry and wet state. The wet state membranes were pre-soaked in 70/30 wt% i-PrOH/water or n-PrOH/water mixture. The sample preparation and measurement are described in our previous study [36–40]. The free-volume radius (R 3 ) is calculated by the semi-empirical equation correlating with the positron lifetime (τ 3 ): (2) τ 3 = 1 2 [ 1 − R 3 R 3 + ∆ R + ( 1 2 π ) sin ( 2 π R 3 R 3 + ∆ R ) ] − 1 where τ 3 is in ns and R 3 in Å, and ΔR is equal to 1.656 Å."
5,Pervaporation test,"2.4 Pervaporation test The dehydration separation performances of the composite membranes for alcohol/water mixture were conducted as described previously [4,13,41,42]. The liquid feed was made in contact to the active layer of the membrane for pervaporation (PV) The effective membrane area used was 5 cm2. The effect of feed temperature was operated from 25 °C to 70 °C while the effect of feed concentration was investigated with 10/90, 30/70, 50/50, 70/30, and 90/10 wt% i-PrOH/water mixtures at 25 °C [43,44]. The pressure on the permeate side was kept under vacuum at 300 Pa using a vacuum pump. The permeate was collected in a trap immersed in liquid nitrogen. The concentration of both feed and permeate was determined through gas chromatography equipped with TCD (GC, China Chromatography 8700T). The total permeation flux (J, g m-2 h-1), pervaporation separation factor (α PV ), and pervaporation separation index (PSI) were calculated based on the following equations: (3) J = W A × t (4) α PV = Y Water / Y i − PrOH X Water / X i − PrOH (5) PSI = J × ( α − 1 ) where W (g) is the weight of the collected permeate at sampling time interval t (h). Y and X refers to the mass fraction of each component in permeate and feed, respectively. The relationship of feed operating temperature and individual permeation flux (J i , kg m-2 h-1) of each component i is determined through the Arrhenius equation given: (6) J i = A e − E p / RT where A (kg m-2 h-1) is the pre-exponential factor; E p (kJ mol-1) is the apparent activation energy of component i; R (kJ mol-1 K-1) is the ideal gas constant which is equivalent to 8.314 × 10-3 kJ mol-1 K-1 and T (K) is the operating feed temperature. The E p was obtained by plotting ln(J i ) vs 1000/T. To normalize the effect of driving force on the separation performance, permeance (P/l, 1 GPU = 7.501 × 10-12 m3(STP) m-2 s-1 Pa-1) and selectivity (β) were calculated based on the following equations: (7) ( P / l ) i = J i p i 0 − p il = J i γ i 0 x i 0 p i 0 sat − p il (8) β = ( P / l ) Water ( P / l ) i − PrOH where J i (g m-2 h-1) is the permeation flux of each component i (water or i-PrOH) and transformed into volumes under standard temperature and pressure (STP). l (m) is the thickness of the membrane. p i0 and p il (Pa) are the partial pressure of component i in the feed and permeate side. p il can be considered to be 0 due to the high-vacuum conditions in the permeate side. γi0 is the activity coefficient of component i in the feed solution which is determined by Wilson equation using Aspen software (Aspen V9 Pro). x i0 is the mole fraction of component i in the feed solution. p i0 sat (Pa) is the saturated vapor pressure of pure component i."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of synthesized GOQDs from citric acid,"3.1 Characterization of synthesized GOQDs from citric acid The GOQDs were successfully synthesized by the moderate pyrolysis of citric acid (CA) at 200 °C. After moderate pyrolysis, CA can be partially carbonized to form nanosheets rich with small sp2 clusters ( Fig. 1a). These sp2 clusters are passivated with oxygen functional groups that was inherited from CA during incomplete carbonization [34]. The optical property of the GOQDs suspension is shown in Fig. 1b–d, where it exhibited its blue luminescent character under UV light at 365 nm. Additionally, particles were confirmed to be formed in solution through testing the Tyndall effect proving that the light had interaction with the particles that constitute colloidal system and homogeneity [45,46] (Fig. 1d). TEM images of the well dispersed GOQDs is shown in Fig. 2a where it revealed a particle size around 15–20 nm [34,47]. The XRD pattern of GOQDs (Fig. 2b) showed a wide peak at 2θ = 25° corresponding to a d-spacing of ~0.34 nm, exhibiting a similar interlayer space of graphene [48]. The AFM image and height profile (Fig. 1c and d) also revealed that the particles are around 20 nm in width and an average height of ~1.0 nm. Graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets usually has an average height of ~1.2 nm [4]. The synthesized GOQDs fall on the same range implying that it has 1–3 layers of GO-like sheets [30,49]. All of the characteristics of the synthesized GOQDs with the similar preparation is comparable to the reported literature [34]. The chemical structure and composition of GOQDs were characterized by FTIR and XPS analysis given in Fig. 3. The FTIR spectrum of GOQDs (Fig. 3a) exhibits absorption peaks of the deformation of C-O and stretching vibration of C˭O in the carboxyl group at 1385 and 1558 cm-1, respectively. Additional stretching vibration of C˭O at 1700 cm-1 [50] was also observed confirming the existence of carboxyl groups in GOQDs [51]. The XPS deconvoluted spectrum (Fig. 3b) further confirmed the chemical functional groups present in the GOQDs. Similar to GO, the four types of carbon bonds [13]: C–C (284.4 eV), C–O (286.0 eV), C˭O (287.8 eV), and O–C˭O (289.0 eV) was observed. The presence of high C–C with C–O peaks confirmed the partial carbonization of citric acid."
8,Physicochemical properties of PVA hybrid membranes,"3.2 Physicochemical properties of PVA hybrid membranes The morphological change on the cross-section of the membranes after integrating GOQDs was compared with uncross-linked PVA and glutaraldehyde cross-linked PVA (PVAx) membranes ( Fig. 4). The polysulfone (PSf) support membrane (Fig. 4a) used has porous finger-like macrovoid structure as a result of phase-inversion precipitation in a non-solvent coagulation bath. The PVA was cast on top surface of the PSf support membrane through solution casting method. The pristine PVA cross-section (Fig. 4b) resulted into a thickness of 5.96 ± 0.15 µm while after cross-linking with glutaraldehyde (PVAx) (Fig. 4c) slightly declined to 5.38 ± 0.04 µm. Upon addition of 100, 300, and 500 ppm of GOQDs (Fig. 4d–f) resulted to the thinning of the dense selective layer to 3.52 ± 0.14, 3.01 ± 0.05, and 3.21 ± 0.12 µm, respectively. A similar observation for sodium alginate membrane was found where the layer slightly decreased upon addition of quantum dots [52]. The decline in PVA layer thickness may have resulted from the additional intermolecular attraction or disturbances in H-bonding of GOQDs with PVA and glutaraldehyde. The enhancement of cross-linking with GOQDs may have allowed the polymer chains to assemble properly. The effect of cross-linking on the chemical structure and crystallinity of the membrane was confirmed by FTIR and XRD spectra analyses in Fig. 5. In general, the effect of cross-linking with glutaraldehyde and PVA would result into a decrease in the absorption at –OH and formation of acetal groups will occur [8]. From Fig. 5a, the –OH absorption peak of the PVAx membrane slightly decreased. Interestingly with the addition of GOQDs the hydroxyl group further declined and shifted which may indicate that changes in H-bonding had occurred. In addition, the formation and appearance of a small shoulder peak around 1700 cm-1 is attributed to the C˭O of the carboxyl groups present in the GOQDs (as observed from Fig. 3a). The diffraction peak of PVA membrane at 2θ = 19.9° was observed in the XRD spectra presented in Fig. 5b. The semi-crystalline nature of the PVA membrane was enhanced by the intermolecular H-bonding where a decrease in peak height was observed after cross-linking with glutaraldehyde for the PVAx membrane. This was attributed to the reduction in crystallinity with an increase in cross-linking density of the membrane [9]. For incorporating fillers into polymer matrix, it is assumed that the crystallinity will be affected by some factors such as: (a) the hydrogen bond barrier effect, (b) the nucleating effect, and (c) the restack effect [53,54]. The hydrogen bond barrier effect was observed with PVAx membranes where glutaraldehyde has reacted with the hydroxyl groups of the PVA polymer chain thus resulting to a less crystalline structure. On the other hand, the integration of GOQDs into the membrane for PVAx-GOQD300, even cross-linked with glutaraldehyde, increased the crystallinity due to the nucleating effect. The restack effect (i.e. decrease in crystallinity after addition of filler) was not observed probably indicating that the GOQDs are well dispersed in the polymer matrix. A similar case was observed for PVA-graphene [53] and PVA-rGO systems [54]. The intensity for PVAx-GOQD300 is still lower compared with pristine PVA due to the effect of cross-linking. The semi-crystalline nature of the membrane was altered showing changes in the polymer chain mobility and may directly affect the separation performance. The surface hydrophilicity of PVA, PVAx, and PVAx-GOQD300 membranes are based on the results from the water contact angle(WCA) test. In general, cross-linking would increase the water contact angle of PVA membranes due to the reacted hydroxyl groups. As seen in Fig. 6a, the WCA of pristine PVA membrane was around 51.2 ± 0.9° while the PVAx membrane was around 54.2 ± 1.6°. The increase in contact angle after cross-linking indicated the reaction between the hydroxyl groups of PVA with glutaraldehyde. Upon addition of GOQDs, the surface hydrophilicity was not greatly affected but increased as the contact angle was around 53.8 ± 0.1°. The slight increase in hydrophilicity may indicate that the GOQDs are present on the polymer matrix. The impact of GOQDs on the swelling resistance of the membrane towards the feed solution (70/30 wt% i-PrOH/water) is shown in Fig. 6b. PVA achieved the highest swelling degree (SD) followed by PVAx then PVAx-GOQD300. Even though the WCA of PVAx-GOQD300 is lower compared with PVAx, the SD of PVAx-GOQD300 is still lower. This may be the effect coming from the interfacial interactions between PVA and GOQDs which restrict the adsorption of water towards the PVA matrix [52]. It was also reported that the swelling of PVA was restrained due to the oxygen functional groups of GO (e.g. –COOH and –OH groups) that can provide additional cross-linking action and also form hydrogen bonds with PVA [55]. Since GOQDs possess similar functional groups with GO the effect towards integration in PVA is assumed to be the same."
9,Pervaporation performance of PVA hybrid membranes,"3.3 Pervaporation performance of PVA hybrid membranes The azeotropic concentration of i-PrOH/water mixture is 87.8 wt% and the waste i-PrOH solution concentration commonly released by semiconductor industry is about 70 wt% [2]. Thus the pervaporative dehydration performance on 70/30 wt% i-PrOH/water was investigated in this study. The effect of GOQDs loading on the separation performance in the pervaporation dehydration at 25 °C was investigated. As shown in Fig. 7a, the uncross-linked PVA membrane showed the highest total permeation flux of 581.0 ± 26.1 g m-2 h-1 with a water concentration in permeate of 95.78 ± 0.68% compared to the membranes that was cross-linked with glutaraldehyde and integrated with GOQDs. However, the relatively lower selectivity of PVA membrane was due to the possible occurrence of local defects and excessive swelling. PVAx membrane showed slightly lower total permeation flux but improved water selectivity than PVA membrane. This is due to the cross-linking effect of glutaraldehyde where the amorphous region allows the transport of permeating molecules. While more amorphous regions are present, the affinity towards water is lessen and in return the flux decreases [9]. Also based from the SD test, PVAx membrane showed better swelling resistance due to fewer amounts of hydroxyl groups than PVA membrane. The effect of integrating GOQDs into the PVAx matrix showed a decreasing trend in total permeation flux with an increase of GOQDs loading. The total permeation flux decreased from 546.28 ± 4.95 g m-2 h-1 (PVAx-GOQD100) to 436.2 ± 27.4 g m-2 h-1 (PVAx-GOQD500) due to the possible increase in crystallinity of the membrane when GOQD is integrated. Another possible reason for the flux decline is the presence of a tortuous path due to the GOQDs and the interface between PVA. The GOQDs could capture water molecules because of its –COOH and –OH groups while i-PrOH molecules experience higher transport resistance. Thus, the water selectivity of the membrane was augmented and PVAx-GOQD300 membrane showed the highest water concentration in permeate of 99.51 ± 0.01%. From Fig. 7b, the separation factor and PSI value of PVAx-GOQD membranes dramatically increased with increasing loading amount of GOQDs from 0 ppm (PVAx) to 300 ppm (PVAx-GOQD300) and then declined by further increasing loading amount to 500 ppm (PVAx-GOQD500). The PVAx-GOQD300 membrane showed the optimum separation performance with a separation factor of 476.4 ± 8.25 and PSI value of 2.20 × 105 g m-2 h-1, which was approximately 5 and 4 times larger than PVAx membrane, resepectively. The decline of separation factor and PSI value after adding more than 300 ppm of GOQDs could be the result of possible restrictions given by the excess GOQDs particles in PVA polymer matrix. Because of this, PVAx-GOQD300 membrane was used to further evaluate the effect of operating conditions in pervaporation."
10,Effect of water concentration in feed on the pervaporation dehydration with PVAx-GOQD300 membrane,"3.4 Effect of water concentration in feed on the pervaporation dehydration with PVAx-GOQD300 membrane The effect of water concentration in feed from 10 wt to 90 wt% was investigated at 25 °C using PVAx-GOQD300 membrane. In Fig. 8a shows that the total permeation flux increased sharply from water concentration in feed of 10–50 wt% followed by maintaining the flux after 50 wt%. The water concentration in permeate declines with an increase in concentration in feed. The increase in swelling enhances the mobility of the polymer chains. The plasticizing effect played a role in this observation where the membrane is swollen at higher water content resulting to the enlargement of free volume thus allowing the transport of both permeating molecules. Regardless, the water concentration in permeate was 98.12 ± 0.08% for water in feed of 90 wt%. To explain these changes, the water and i-PrOH flux for PVAx-GOQD300 membrane was provided in Fig. 8b. While increasing the water concentration in feed, the i-PrOH flux exhibited a slight increase from 2.26 ± 0.12 g m-2 h-1 to 12.5 ± 1.34 g m-2 h-1 , while the water flux increased from 461.2 ± 18.1 g m-2 h-1 to 645.1 ± 0.99 g m-2 h-1. The increased water concentration in feed would mean that the partial pressure of water on the feed side also increased while the permeate side was kept under vacuum conditions. Thus enhancing the driving force for water more than i-PrOH. Nevertheless, from Fig. 8b, the permeation rate of water was extremely higher than that of i-PrOH. Further analysis of permeation, the permeance of each component with normalized driving force and membrane thickness is shown in Fig. 8c. The water permeance gradually increased after 30 wt% water in feed while the i-PrOH increased with increasing water concentration in feed. Thus further proving that the swelling greatly affects the polymer chain mobility at water concentration in feed >30 wt%. The selectivity after 30 wt% water in feed dropped to about 3-folds. Suggesting that the membrane is more stable up to 30 wt% water in feed."
11,Effect of feed temperature on the pervaporation dehydration with PVAx-GOQD300 membrane,"3.5 Effect of feed temperature on the pervaporation dehydration with PVAx-GOQD300 membrane The effect of feed temperature with PVAx-GOQD300 was performed using 70/30 wt% i-PrOH/water mixture from 25 °C to 70 °C. The total flux and separation factor is shown in Fig. 9a where a rapid increase in flux was observed while the separation decreases with increasing feed temperature. The partial flux of water and i-PrOH in Fig. 9b tells that the water increases more rapidly than i-PrOH. This could be explained by the following two reasons: (a) the increase of partial pressure of each component in the feed side while the permeate side remained under vacuum condition, thus driving force is enhanced; and (b) the thermal motion of the permeating molecules as well as the polymer chain mobility is directly affected, thus promoting faster permeation for both components. The influence of temperature on permeation flux is quantitatively measured using the apparent activation energy (E p ) based on the Arrhenius equation given in Eq. (6). The apparent activation energy for water (E p,water = 26.3 kJ mol-1) and i-PrOH (E p,i-PrOH = 50.3 kJ mol-1) are shown in Fig. 9c. The much higher i-PrOH activation energy suggests that i-PrOH flux responds more sensitively towards temperature. While lower water activation energy indicates that water molecules require smaller amount of energy to penetrate through the membrane. Normalizing the driving force and membrane thickness to show the inherent property of the hybrid membrane, the permeance of each component and selectivity are shown in Fig. 9d. The water permeance decreases due to the increase in partial pressure while i-PrOH permeance increased at 40 °C from 25 °C due to the direct effect of increasing the temperature. From here, it could be noted that the increase of temperature to 40 °C greatly affects the polymer chain mobility and permeant thermal motion. The i-PrOH permeance decreases after 40 °C which is mainly the effect of the increase of partial pressure in the feed side and this resulted to the decrease of selectivity. Nevertheless, the water concentration in permeate was around 98.04 ± 0.09 wt% for a 70/30 wt% i-PrOH/water feed concentration at 70 °C showing an effective dehydration of alcohol with high water content."
12,Effect of various alcohol/water mixture on the pervaporation dehydration performance of PVAx-GOQD300 membrane,"3.6 Effect of various alcohol/water mixture on the pervaporation dehydration performance of PVAx-GOQD300 membrane The pervaporation dehydration with various 70/30 wt% alcohol/water mixtures were also investigated to show the effect of molecular size on the separation performance. It was earlier found that the permeation flux decreases while selectivity increases with an increase in the molecular weight of compounds [56]. Both PVAx and PVAx-GOQD300 membranes followed this trend. In Table 1, alongside the increase in carbon atoms of alcohol is the increase in water concentration in permeate because large molecules require a larger amount of energy to diffuse through the membrane. However, an interesting observation was found for isomeric alcohols (e.g. propanol and butanol) if the performance of both membranes are being compared. For isomeric alcohols, the linear alcohol (n-PrOH and n-BuOH) has higher flux compared with their sterically hindered (branched) structure (i-PrOH and t-BuOH). This could be explained by the lower molar volume and average dynamic cross-section of linear alcohol than their branched isomer shown in Table 2. The water selectivity with the butanol isomers is similar when both of the membranes are being compared. An unusual observation was seen with the propanol isomers, where the total flux of i-PrOH/water was lower with PVAx-GOQD300 membranes than in PVAx membranes while that for the total flux of n-PrOH/water was higher in PVAx-GOQD300 membranes than in PVAx membranes. For better visualization of the trend, the flux and water concentration in permeate for the separation of propanol isomers using both membranes are shown in Fig. 10. A possible reason for this unusual behavior may come from the polarity of the molecule. Based on their Dimroth’s solvent polarity value, n-PrOH (50.7 kcal mol-1) is more polar compared with i-PrOH (48.6 kcal mol-1), water has a Dimroth’s solvent polarity value of 63.1 kcal mol-1 [58]. Yoshikawa et al. [59] mentioned before that the permselectivity of the membrane during pervaporation toward water gradually increases with the increase in the difference in Dimroth’s solvent polarity values between alcohol and water. Assuming that the polarity of the membrane with GOQDs is also enhanced, due to more polar groups, the interaction of the membrane with the n-PrOH molecules enhances. This would mean that the n-PrOH molecules compete with water molecules in diffusing through the membrane. To investigate why the PVAx-GOQD300 membrane seems to have higher affinity with polar molecules. The free volume character of PVAx and PVAx-GOQD300 membranes were tested using positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) under dry and wet conditions. At wet condition, the membranes were pre-soaked in either 70/30 wt% n-PrOH/ water or i-PrOH/water mixtures for 24 h. The fractional free volume characteristics are shown in Table 3. The values for the o-Ps lifetime (τ3) of the dry membranes are smaller compared with the wet membranes. To better understand the free volume size distribution in the membranes, the positron lifetime distributions and τ3 with the corresponding radius distribution for both dry and wet states is shown in Fig. 11. In Fig. 11a, it is clearly seen that the free volume radius and its distribution are comparable for PVAx membrane in both propanol isomers. While in Fig. 11b, the distribution and free volume radius for PVAx-GOQD300 membrane in n-PrOH/water is wider and larger compared with the membranes immersed in i-PrOH/water. This may suggest that the integration of GOQDs would promote additional affinity with n-PrOH, since its polarity is higher than i-PrOH thus the interaction between n-PrOH and water molecules are stronger. PVAx-GOQD300 showed larger values in n-PrOH while for PVAx is in i-PrOH. Thus directly showing that alcohol/water mixtures affect the free volume radius (R 3 ) and free volume intensity (I 3 ) of the membrane. From the results, PVAx in i-PrOH/water has larger R 3 (3.206 ± 0.004 Å) and I 3 (19.433 ± 0.377%) than PVAx-GOQD300 (2.863 ± 0.008 Å and 18.820 ± 0.338%), which justifies the lower water selectivity of PVAx membrane (Table 1). Overall, based from the PALS analysis, it is noteworthy to mention that the integration of GOQDs in the cross-linked PVA matrix would provide additional interaction for linear structured alcohol than the sterically hindered isomer."
13,Long-term pervaporation test and comparison of performance with other membranes,"3.7 Long-term pervaporation test and comparison of performance with other membranes The stability of the membrane at long-term operation process is an important test to evaluate the PV separation performance. The long-term pervaporation test of PVAx-GOQD300 membrane with 70/30 wt% i-PrOH/water mixture at 70 °C is presented in Fig. 12. The flux was maintained to ~2000 g m-2 h-1 and water concentration in permeate at >98% for 336 h of operation at 70 °C. The stability of this membrane shows potential for practical applications. Finally, the pervaporation performance of different PVA-based and GO-based membranes reported in literatures for the separation of i-PrOH/water mixture is listed in Table 4. The performance of PVAx-GOQD300 membrane shows comparable separation performance compared with PVA-based and GO-based membranes even at high operating temperature. This shows that the facile synthesis of GOQDs gives additional advantage as a potential filler for polymeric PV membrane."
14,Conclusion,"An emerging material, graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs), was evaluated for its potential as a filler for pervaporation membrane. It was integrated in poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and uniformly cast on a support membrane. The integration of GOQDs into glutaraldehyde cross-linked PVA matrix had an effect on its physicochemical structure resulting to changes in separation performance with 70/30 wt% i-PrOH/water mixture. The integration of GOQDs into the glutaraldehyde cross-linked PVA matrix regained its crystallinity as the particles acted as a nucleating agent. This resulted into a tortuous path for the permeating molecules and augments the water selectivity of the membrane. It was also found that the augmentation of water selectivity was due to the presence of hydrophilic oxygen functional groups found on the sp2 clusters that is similar with graphene oxide (GO). The membrane integrated with 300 ppm of GOQD (PVAx-GOQD300) showed the highest separation performance in terms of separation factor and PSI value. It has a total permeation flux of 463.5 ± 18.2 g m-2 h-1, a separation factor of 476.4 ± 8.25 and a PSI value of 2.20 × 105 g m-2 h-1. An unusual finding was observed when PVAx-GOQD300 membrane was tested for the pervaporation separation of propanol isomer/water mixture. The positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) results revealed that the fractional free volume and size of the membrane varied when in contact with the different propanol isomer/water mixture. The PVAx-GOQD300 membrane showed larger free volume size in n-PrOH/water than i-PrOH/water mixtures which justified the low separation for the linear alcohol/water mixtures. The PALS analysis also revealed that integrating GOQDs would provide additional interaction of the membrane towards linear structured alcohol than the sterically hindered isomer. The PVAx-GOQD300 membrane showed good long-term operation stability up to 336 h at 70 °C with 70/30 wt% i-PrOH/water mixture. The long operating time, high operating temperature, and high water content in feed shows the potential stability of the membrane for practical application. The findings from this study provided an evaluation for a new hydrophilic filler that is easily synthesized for the dehydration of alcohol/water mixtures by pervaporation."
