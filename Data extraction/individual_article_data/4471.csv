0,Introduction,"Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is an important ultra large scale integration (ULSI) fabrication process that is usually applied during terminal downstream steps such as silicon substrate polishing [1,2], the interlevel line and dielectric dual damascene steps [3–6], and shallow trench isolation (STI) [7]. As a result, post-CMP defect targets are typically the most stringent in the process. At this stage, defects inevitably translate into loss of yield [8]. As ULSI feature sizes shrink to 14 nm, post-CMP defect tolerances have decreased to the order of dozens of pico-meters. Thus, strategies for reducing all types of defects have become critical to fabrication. Scratches are the most detrimental CMP defect [9,10] because they cannot be removed by other means during post-CMP cleaning. Rather, they can only be prevented. Although reducing nano-scale scratches is critical to ULSI, the nature of the scratch formation is not well understood. Particles larger than 0.5 μm resulting from particle agglomeration in the slurry are the most probable cause of scratches [11–13]. In addition, Kim et al. claimed that scratches may be caused by pad asperities themselves [14,15]. Thus, the effects of tribological interactions between the polishing pad and wafer on scratch formation have been studied extensively. Kim et al. proposed that scratching can be mitigated by decreasing the friction coefficient, and decreasing the ratio of the pad hardness to the copper hardness [16]. Choi et al. stated that pores and grooves determine the slurry transportation parameters and contact area at the pad/wafer interface, and that scratches are generated from sources present on the polishing pad [17]. Furthermore, proper pad conditioning contributes to scratch reduction by optimizing the pad surface roughness and porosity and by opening pad micro-holes that can trap polishing byproducts [9,18–20]. Therefore, given the increased yield targets for advanced technological nodes and beyond, it is critical to reduce nano-scale scratching by improving tribological behavior [14,15] and removing polishing byproducts [21–23] during CMP, in addition to controlling large particles in the slurry. Surfactants are widely used in cleaning technology [24–26], the textile industry [27], oil-water separation [28], synthesis of nanoscale materials [29], lubricants [30–34], and lubricating coatings [35,36]. A properly chosen surfactant can contribute to particle dispersion [35,37–39], serve as an effective lubricant that reduces mechanical stress [40–42], and enhance cleaning efficiency [24–26]. However, although surfactants exhibit great potential to reduce CMP scratch defects, surfactant studies have been focused on stabilization of particulate dispersions [43–45], enhancing topographical selectivity [46], and post-CMP cleaning [24,26,47]. There are few systematic investigations of the role of surfactants during scratch formation. In this paper, we demonstrate synergy between dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA) and isomeric alcohol polyoxyethylene ether (iAEO) for reduction of nano-scale scratches during copper CMP. DBSA is a metal ion-free anionic surfactant that can reduce surface tension [48] and modify particles by adsorbing efficiently at the interface [46,49–51]. iAEO is a fatty alcohol polyoxyethylene ether (RO(C2H4O)nH) that represents an inexpensive, environmentally friendly [52,53], nonionic surfactant and dispersant [54]. When n = 4–6, AEO is an outstanding wetting agent with excellent hydrophilicity and permeation [55–59] because polyethylene oxides exhibit strong hydrogen-bonding affinity with water [55]. The isomeric structural shift of the hydroxyl group towards the center of the alkylene chain gives it high efficiency [60,61] and speed [62,63] in decreasing surface tension and allows it to form stable hydrogen bonds [64] during adsorption. The synergistic effects of DBSA and iAEO described in this work may significantly improve dispersibility, enhance tribological behavior, and have a large impact on the transport of slurry byproducts during CMP. Finally, this work can contribute to the prevention of scratch formation."
1,Experimental,"A slurry without a surfactant was used as a baseline (BL) for comparison of the relative polishing performances of the surfactant-containing slurries developed in this study. The BL slurry consisted of 3 wt% colloidal SiO2 (Fuso Co., Japan), 0.15 wt% FA/OII chelating agent (reagent grade, developed in our lab [65]), 0.5 wt% H2O2 (electronic grade, BASF Co., Germany) as an oxidizer, and deionized (DI) water. To investigate the surfactant effect, a series of slurries was prepared by adding 0.1 wt% DBSA (ACS reagent grade, Sigma-Aldrich Chem. Co., USA) and 0.3 wt% iAEO (ACS reagent grade, LexxisoTM1305, Exxon-Mobil Co., USA) to the slurries separately. The physical properties and chemical structures of the surfactants are described in Table 1 and Fig. 1 , respectively. Since different slurry pH levels lead to different modified surface physical and mechanical properties [66,67], each of the slurries was adjusted to a pH of 9.7 by adding KOH or HNO3 (electronic grade, BASF Co., Germany). Next, the slurries were filtered using a filter with 0.7 μm pores (3 M Inc., USA). The mean particle size and zeta potential of the slurry were measured using a NICOMP 380ZLS (PSS Company, USA). Large particles (>0.5 μm) were counted using a Nicomp AccuSizer 780 (PSS Company, USA). A JD200D static angle analyzer (Shanghai Zhongchen Inc., China) was used to measure the slurry surface tension. Twelve-inch blanket copper wafers (1 μm thick via electrochemical plating) were polished using a France Alpsitec E460 polisher with an IC 1000 (DOW Electronic Materials, USA) polyurethane pad. Before the experiment, pad break-in was performed for 20 min. The working pressure was 1.5 psi, the head and platen speeds were 55 rpm and 65 rpm, respectively, and the slurry flow rate was 300 ml/min. Ex-situ conditioning was performed using a C4 diamond conditioner (3 M Inc., USA). During polishing, the pad temperature was measured in-situ using an infrared thermometer located above the pad surface. The polished wafers were subsequently cleaned to remove particles using a polyvinyl alcohol brush and an internally developed alkaline cleaning solution [65]. The material removal rate (MRR) was calculated by measuring the difference in the copper film thickness before and after CMP using a four-point probe. The 300 mm polished Cu wafers were scanned with a 3 mm edge exclusion zone using an optical inspection system (KLA Tencor 2915 optical microscope, USA) to detect defect locations. The inspection limitation was 0.06 nm for 14 nm ULSI production. The defect morphologies were then carefully examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, KLA-Tencor, USA) review system that was guided by the defect map (Fig. 2 ). Scratches were counted manually from each image. Three 60 s polishing runs were performed and average MRRs and scratch counts were reported. The normalized scratch counts (scratches per wafer) were defined as the mean of three sets of scratch data divided by the number of scratches formed by using a baseline slurry on a new pad. In order to investigate time-dependent MRR and scratch behavior, a series of CMP experiments, each for 14 h of pad lifetime, were performed separately and continuously using different slurries and four fresh pads. To start, a Cu blanket wafer was polished using a new pad to obtain MRR and scratch data. To age the pad, a Cu disc (99.99%) was then polished for 15 min with the same slurry. This was followed by 3 min of pad conditioning. This cycle was repeated until the Cu blanket wafers were polished for 2 h of pad lifetime. New slurries were prepared before additional Cu blanket wafers were polished. In order to describe the mechanical and structural changes to the pad surface after CMP, a series of tests was performed after 14 h of pad lifetime. The pad hardness was measured using a Shore duratometer. The JD200D static angle analyzer was used to measure the contact angles between the pad and slurries by taking photographs immediately after dropping a small amount of slurry onto the pad surface. A dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA, Tritec-2000B, England) was used to measure the elastic properties (stiffnesses) of the pads. Plain pad samples (40 mm × 7 mm × 2 mm) without grooves were taken from used pads. The storage modulus and energy dissipation were then obtained at a frequency of 1 Hz (single-cantilever bending mode) using a temperature ramp rate of 3 °C/min. Morphological changes to the pad ware characterized using an SEM with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Before characterization, the pad was cleaned with DI water for 15 min."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Slurry characterization,"3.1 Slurry characterization Fig. 3 (a)–3(d) show spherical slurry morphologies with different particle sizes, with and without surfactants. Fig. 3(e) shows the different slurry particle size distributions (PSD). Table 2 shows the surface tensions, zeta potentials, and average particle sizes (obtained from the PSD in Fig. 3(e)) of these slurries. The slurries with surfactants exhibit lower surface tensions than those without. There is no significant change in the ζ potential upon addition of either DBSA or iAEO. It is well known that silica is negatively charged in the basic pH range [68,69]. Therefore, the anionic surfactant DBSA adsorbs little [46] because of strong electrostatic repulsion by negative charges on silica. In contrast, iAEO is a nonionic surfactant that adsorbs onto silica [70] via hydrogen bonding between surfactant ethoxy groups and hydroxyl groups on the silica. However iAEO does not change ζ potentials because it is electrically neutral. In contrast, as shown in Table 1, the ζ potential exceeds that of the BL when DBSA is added to iAEO-containing solutions. DBSA adsorption is enhanced due to hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions between surfactants. Hydrocarbon chain interaction between DBSA and iAEO is strong because the relative hydrocarbon chain lengths are similar [71]. The synergistic effects of the surfactant mixture modify the surface charges and thus the electrostatic forces. Moreover, the adsorbed surfactant layer helps to keep the particles at a greater separation distance due to steric forces [72], which in turn decreases the attractive forces between particles. In addition, the silica particles exhibit different particle sizes in the presence of different surfactants at the same pH value (9.7) (Table 2). These particle sizes are obtained from the particle size distributions in Fig. 3(e) and are in good agreement with morphologically determined sizes obtained via SEM (Fig. 3(a)–3(d)). Addition of either the anionic surfactant DBSA or the nonionic surfactant iAEO causes no significant slurry dispersion. Instead, the average particle size of a slurry with iAEO is greater (75.90 nm) than that of a baseline slurry (67.11 nm). This is because the tails of adsorbed iAEO molecules can bridge particles, leading to aggregation [43,44]. Only the slurry with both DBSA and iAEO exhibits improved dispersibility, as synergy between surfactants provides sufficient electrostatic repulsion and steric forces between the particles. A schematic of surfactant adsorption onto silica particles that is consistent with our ζ potential and particle size data, as well as the above discussion, is shown in Fig. 4 . We believe that the synergistic dispersibility effects observed in these alkaline slurries are similar to the synergistic effect of cationic and nonionic surfactants reported for acidic slurries [45]. These hypotheses are verified using the large particle count (LPC) tests in Fig. 5 . The error bar is derived from the standard deviation of the three LPC measurements. The slurry LPCs rank as follows: iAEO > baseline > DBSA > iAEO + DBSA. This further demonstrates that the synergistic effect of DBSA and iAEO on particle dispersion coincides well with the adsorption mechanism in Fig. 4. Small populations (≤1 ppm) of large (>0.5 μm) particles are the chief instigators of CMP-induced defect formation [11,13]."
4,Polishing performance,"3.2 Polishing performance The MRR and scratch number are plotted in Fig. 6 (a) as a function of the surfactant type. The error bar is derived from the standard deviation of the three sets of polishing data. Slurries with iAEO or DBSA are less effective at material removal than BL. Organic surfactants can serve as lubricants between the copper wafer and polishing pad by coating abrasive particles [41] (like iAEO) or in unabsorbed form in the slurry fluid [46,73] (like DBSA). This is expected to decrease friction and thus decrease temperatures because of the linear relationship between the pad surface temperature and the product of the coefficient of friction (COF) × pressure × velocity [74]. To confirm this, the polishing pad temperature evolution is monitored [75,76] in Fig. 6(b). The temperatures of surfactant-containing slurries are lower than that of the BL. This confirms that all of the surfactants act as lubricants and lower the COF, thus lowering the MRRs of iAEO- and DBSA-containing slurries. This result coincides with data from early reports [41,77,78]. Fig. 6(a) shows that the synergistic effects of DBSA and iAEO can increase the MRR even though they increase the ζ potential (Table 1) and lower the temperature (Fig. 6(b)). A higher MRR indicates a smaller mean particle size and uniform distribution in the mixed-surfactant slurry. The theory presented by Luo and Dornfeld [79] suggests that this leads to more “active” abrasive particles that cause abrasions and yield a larger MRR. This observed trend is consistent with some previously reported data [80] and is in agreement with molecular-scale [81,82] and physics-based [83] CMP models. The relationship between the scratch number and surfactant type is shown in Fig. 6 (a). The slurry with both DBSA and iAEO has the fewest scratches. This indicates that agglomerated particles are a major factor in causing scratches during CMP [11,13]. Furthermore, the addition of iAEO or DBSA separately decreases scratching in Fig. 6(a). Previous research indicates that surfactants have the opposite effect on scratching. Hong Liang stated that CMP is a “chemical boundary lubrication (CBL) process” [84] where the boundary to mixed regimes on the Stribeck curve are demarcated during polishing [85]. The addition of a lubricant lowers the COF and shifts the tribological mechanism toward partial lubrication according to the Stribeck curve illustrated in Fig. 7 [74,86], thus reducing scratching [17,23]. On the other hand, addition of a lubricant lowers the polishing temperature (Fig. 6(b)), which hardens the pad [87] and eventually increases scratching. According to S. Kim, N. Saka, T. Eusner, and J.-H. Chun [14–16], increasing the pad hardness causes scratching. However, in our experimental case, it is concluded that lubrication has a more significant effect than changes in the pad hardness."
5,Polishing performance during the pad lifetime,"3.3 Polishing performance during the pad lifetime Furthermore, a series of CMP experiments, each for 14 h of pad lifetime, were performed separately and continuously using different slurries and four fresh pads to investigate time-dependent MRR and scratch behavior. The results are plotted in Fig. 8 . Similarly, the error bar in this figure is derived from the standard deviation of the three sets of polishing data. The MRRs of all wafers are stable over time. This implies that the diamond conditioner maintains stable pad surfaces and avoids glazing [20,88]. However, the scratch number varies with the slurry. The fewest scratches are formed over 14 h of pad lifetime when the slurry with both DBSA and iAEO is used. This indicates that the synergistic effect of the surfactant mixture produces stable, lower scratch densities throughout polishing. In slurries that do not contain iAEO, the number of scratches increases as a function of time. In contrast, the number of scratches remains low in slurries with iAEO. We sought to further understand the differences between pads that have been used with slurries that contain various surfactants. We observed pad mechanical and material properties using a Shore duratometer, DMA, contact angle measurement apparatus, SEM, and EDS. To begin, we monitored the pad hardness as a function of the polishing time (Fig. 9 (a)). The error bar is derived from the standard deviation of the three measurements. The hardness of a new pad follows the order BL < iAEO < DBSA < mix. This may contribute to the different polishing temperatures shown in Fig. 6(b). The pads used with an iAEO-free slurry harden with time, while the pad used with an iAEO-containing slurry remains soft. Reasonable relationships are observed between the slurry additives, pad hardnesses, and scratch numbers. Slurries without iAEO can harden pads even with conditioning, and thus increase the number of scratches [14–16]. Fig. 9(b) compares the storage modulus (E’) and its ratio with the loss modulus (tan δ) for pads B (DBSA-containing slurry) and C (iAEO-containing slurry). Pad C has a lower storage modulus and a higher tan δ than pad B. The storage modulus determined via DMA measures the ability of the polymer to store elastic energy and is associated with recoverable elastic deformation [89,90]. The higher rigidity of pad B may be attributed in part to structural changes that occur during polishing. In addition, the ratio of the loss and storage moduli (tan δ) is the viscoelastic response of the polymer formulation. It represents the ratio of the energy dissipated in the form of heat to the maximum potential energy stored during a deformation cycle [89,90]. The higher tan δ of pad C indicates physical modification of the pad during CMP. The differences between the hardnesses and material properties of pads B and C may be explained by two factors. First, pad C may have a greater water uptake than pad B. Since the polyurethane pad is negatively charged in a basic environment [68], nonionic surfactant iAEO molecules can adsorb onto its surface via lipophilic groups [91]. This does not occur with DBSA due to electrostatic repulsion. Fig. 10 shows contact angles between slurries and pad surfaces after polishing for 14 h of pad lifetime with various surfactant solutions. The contact angle decreases from 62° to 37° in the presence of iAEO. iAEO causes water molecules to penetrate pores via capillary action according to Washburn's equation [92] because of its excellent permeation [55–59] and wetting abilities, which are enhanced by its branched hydrophobic chain [62,63]. The polyurethane polymer hardness decreases monotonically as the water uptake increases [93]. Therefore, a more hydrophilic pad surface leads to higher water uptake, and eventually a softer pad. Second, we can assume that abrasive particles and polishing byproducts penetrate into the polishing pad during CMP [94]. iAEO molecules can attach to the pad surface and polishing byproducts quickly during CMP because surfactants with branched chains have high dynamic surface activities [62,63]. The fast adsorption efficiency of branched [62,63] iAEO results in surfactant molecules that attach to the pad and polishing byproduct surfaces. This allows them to participate in direct mechanical contact between the wafer, pad surface, and iAEO, and produce higher shear forces [95–97] that can remove particles and byproducts from the pad during conditioning. To confirm this, SEM and EDS of pads B (DBSA-containing slurry) and C (iAEO-containing slurry) are shown in Fig. 11 . Pads B and C have the same morphology after conditioning, but EDS analysis confirms that the pad B surface contains silicon components. In-Ha Sung et al. observed the same chemical composition during EDS analysis of used pads [94]. Chen et al. used molecular dynamics simulations to determine that abrasive clusters can become completely embedded into a pad during CMP [98]. In contrast, silicon is completely absent from the pad C (iAEO-containing slurry) surface. Hence, it can be deduced that iAEO increases shear forces and reduces the degree to which particles can adhere tightly to the pad, resulting in the removal of abrasive particles and polishing byproducts and a low probability of scratch generation [21–23,97], as shown in Fig. 8. A schematic that shows changes in the surfaces of pads B (DBSA-containing slurry) and C (iAEO-containing slurry) during CMP and conditioning is illustrated in Fig. 12 . Based on data from the Shore duratometer, DMA, contact angle tool, SEM, and EDS, we believe that one possible mechanism that explains why the number of scratches increases with time in the absence of iAEO, but remains low in the presence of iAEO is: 1) iAEO increases pad water uptake via its excellent permeation and wetting abilities. This softens the pad and thus reduces scratching. 2) iAEO absorbs between the pad and abrasive particles or polishing byproducts during polishing because its branched chain provides fast, efficient adsorption. This leads to effective removal of abrasive particles and polishing byproducts, which reduces scratching. This phenomenon has never been reported before."
6,Conclusion,"In summary, we have demonstrated that surfactants play an important role in reducing nano-scale scratching. Inclusion of either the anionic surfactant DBSA or the nonionic surfactant iAEO in a slurry contributed to shifting the tribological mechanism towards partial lubrication on the Stribeck curve and reduced scratching by 16% and 6%, respectively. However, inclusion of these surfactants produced lower MRRs. On the other hand, their similar hydrocarbon chain lengths generated strong synergistic effects when these anionic and nonionic surfactants were used together. This led to excellent abrasive particle dispersion, low slurry large particle counts, and 86% fewer scratches than BL without affecting the MRR. In addition, scratch data measured after 14 h of pad lifetime showed that slurries with both DBSA and iAEO offer better stabilities and lower scratch densities than the slurry without iAEO. Data from the Shore duratometer, DMA, contact angle tool, SEM, and EDS suggest that iAEO may increase pad water uptake and effectively remove polishing byproducts from the pad, thus significantly reducing scratches. Therefore, synergy between DBSA and iAEO can reduce nano-scale scratching during chemical mechanical polishing remarkably. This knowledge can help researchers to reduce scratch formation from slurries intended for various CMP processes, such as interlevel line or dielectric dual damascene processes (colloidal silica-based slurry) and STI processes (ceria-based slurry), in order to meet the need for increased ULSI yields."
