0,Introduction,"Disposal of polymers such as nylon, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride has always been an issue toward our environment. This is due to the non-biodegradable characteristic of those polymers by the microorganism and bacteria in the water/soil. Therefore, there is an increasing interest in producing biodegradable polymers for various applications. One among those is polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). PVA is a synthetic polymer with a backbone that consists primarily of hydroxyl bonds, which is biodegradable. PVA is widely used in the production of adhesives, fibers, paper, membranes, drug release media and pharmaceutical products. It is tasteless, odorless and possesses good mechanical properties [1]. Unlike other polymers, which are normally produced via polymerization, PVA is produced from hydrolysis of polyvinyl acetate. The hydrolysis reaction of polyvinyl acetate to PVA was first introduced by Herrman and Haehnel in 1924. The catalysts most often used for the hydrolysis reaction are alkali catalysts such as sodium or potassium hydroxide. PVA is normally produced from polyvinyl acetate in continuously mixed flow reactors. The acetate groups are hydrolyzed by the anion from alcohol (CH3O–) in the presence of catalyst [2,3]. PVA is soluble in water but mostly insoluble in organic solvent. Therefore, thin white flakes of PVA are precipitated out during the hydrolysis process of polyvinyl acetate which is soluble in methanol [4]. Fig. 1 shows the reaction pathway in which polyvinyl acetate is hydrolyzed to PVA by methanol. When polyvinyl acetate is alcoholized with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as a basic catalyst in methanol, a mixed polymer containing both hydroxyl and acetyl groups is formed. Different by products produced from the hydrolysis of polyvinyl acetate. In the presence of methanol, the by product is methyl acetate. In addition to the degree of polymerization of PVA products (molecular weight range 20,000–400,000) [5], the common commercial grades of PVA is classified into partially hydrolyzed (10–15 mol% acetate groups); intermediate hydrolyzed (3–7 mol% acetate groups) and fully hydrolyzed (1–2 mol% acetate groups). Many mechanical properties of PVA such as water solubility is strongly associated with the degree of hydrolysis where it is also known as the degree of saponification of polyvinyl acetate during reaction [4]. Fully hydrolyzed PVA has low water solubility compared to partially hydrolyzed PVA [6]. The applications of PVA differ based on the degree of hydrolysis in PVA product due to the different properties of it. Completely hydrolyzed PVA is widely used in water-resistant adhesive where a high degree of wet tack is required. Partially hydrolyzed PVA is used in making films for packages such as for bleaches, bath salts, insecticides, and disinfectants. Partially hydrolyzed PVA is also known as a copolymer of vinyl alcohol and vinyl acetate as it contains both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts in its structure [4]. PVA productions have been tested mostly starting from different monomers and conditions [4,7,8] as well as the influence of different variables during those processes. It is also widely being tested as feed for other materials due to its biodegradable properties. Although the reaction to produce PVA is known and there are commercial scale productions of PVA in the market, there are still some unexplained issues occur during production. The present study aims to provide additional insight into the influence of the operating parameters on the degree of hydrolysis during the production of PVA directly from polyvinyl acetate for future reference."
1,Material and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The feedstock, polyvinyl acetate, M.W.100,000 used was from ACROS Organics. Methanol (laboratory grade), another reactant was from Fischer Scientific. Sodium hydroxide, NaOH (97%) from Systerm Chemicals and hydrochloric acid, HCl (37%, reagent grade) from Quality Reagent Chemical were both used as catalyst and titration agent, respectively."
3,Hydrolysis of polyvinyl acetate,"2.2 Hydrolysis of polyvinyl acetate Hydrolysis process was based on Alihemati & Navarchian [3]. 3 g of polyvinyl acetate was dissolved in 120 ml of methanol in a 250 ml round bottom flask. Then the required amount of catalyst, NaOH or HCl, was added based on a required ratio of catalyst to polyvinyl acetate. A solution of NaOH and methanol with 50:50 volume parts each was added to the polyvinyl acetate solution. The hydrolysis reaction was allowed to occur at predetermined temperature for a specific time of reactions. The speed of stirring was set at 700 rpm except when the effect of stirring speed was studied. The mixing and heating were done under a reflux system to avoid evaporation of solution especially methanol due to high reaction temperatures. Similar procedure was carried out for the experiments conducted using HCl as the catalyst. Once the hydrolysis reaction was done, the PVA was recovered from the solution via filtration (<25 μm) and washed with water. The filtrate was then dried in the oven at 60 °C overnight [9]."
4,Product analysis and testing,"2.3 Product analysis and testing 2.3.1 Degree of hydrolysis Titration was carried out for the calculation of the degree of hydrolysis in PVA formed from a given time and temperature of reaction. This titration procedure was adapted from the procedures by JECFA [10]. 1 g of the dried sample was added to a 250 ml round bottom flask. Then 25 ml of 0.5 M NaOH and 25 ml of distilled water was added to the flask. The mixture was refluxed for 30 min at 100 °C with a stirring speed of 500 rpm. After 30 min the mixture was cooled to room temperature, added two drops of phenolphthalein indicator and immediately titrated using 0.5 M HCl. The indicator was prepared by dissolving 0.5 g of phenolphthalein powder in 50 vol% of ethanol (50 ml ethanol and 5 ml water). The initial and final volume of HCl in the buret was recorded and the degree of hydrolysis was calculated using the Eqs. (1) and (2) [10]. (1) S = 39.997 V 2 − V 1 × M W (2) D H = 100 − 7.84 × S 100 − 0.075 × S where S = saponification value; V 2 = volume of HCl consumed by blank; V 1 = volume of HCl consumed by sample; M = molarity of HCl solution (0.5 M); W = weight of sample (1 g); DH = degree of hydrolysis. 2.3.2 Solubility test The solubility test is based on Haweel and Ammar [4]. The solubility test on PVA with different degree of hydrolysis was done by dissolving 4 wt% of PVA in distilled water which was preheated to 40 °C. The PVA was let to dissolve in water and the time which was taken by PVA to dissolve in water (when the solution turning transparent) were recorded. 2.3.3 PVA characterization The surface morphology was studied on a Quanta FEG450 scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The elemental composition was analyzed by using an energy dispersive X-ray detector (EDX) by Oxford Instrument. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer was used to identify the surface functional groups of PVA. The spectra were recorded over the range of 4000–600 cm−1 using Perkin-Elmer System 2000 spectrometer."
5,Result and discussion,
6,Effect of reaction temperature on degree of hydrolysis,"3.1 Effect of reaction temperature on degree of hydrolysis The effects of reaction temperature on the degree of hydrolysis of polyvinyl acetate during the reaction were carried out at temperature: 35 °C, 50 °C and 70 °C in the presence of alkali catalyst, NaOH. The degree of hydrolysis in PVA obtained from reactions at different temperatures is shown in Fig. 2 . Fig. 2 shows that the degree of hydrolysis trend lines is increasing with temperature regardless of the reaction time length. The increasing trend is expected as higher temperature increased the rate of reaction. The hydrolysis of polyvinyl acetate in the presence of alkali catalyst is an endothermic reaction [3]. Hence, at higher temperature more heat is available for the reaction to occur at a faster rate leading to the increase in the rate of reaction. Thus, more acetate groups in polyvinyl acetate are hydrolyzed forming PVA of a higher degree of hydrolysis. Similar result trends are also reported [4]. In general, as shown in Fig. 2, the degree of hydrolysis increases with reaction temperature from 35 °C to 70 °C for reactions with different reaction times. For the reaction of 60 min, the degree of hydrolysis obtained at 35 °C is 75.7%. The degree of hydrolysis increased to 96.1% when the reaction temperature increased to 70 °C. The reaction rate was reported slow for reaction temperature below 60 °C [11]. Therefore, temperature around 60 °C is normally used in order to achieve higher (>90%) degree of hydrolysis PVA. Temperature much higher than the boiling point of methanol (65 °C) may cause evaporation of the solvent. So, in order to avoid unwanted evaporation, 60 °C is better to be used in the production for higher degree of hydrolysis by tuning other operating parameter. It is also suggested as the optimum temperature by Shibutani et al. [12]."
7,Effect of reaction time on degree of hydrolysis,"3.2 Effect of reaction time on degree of hydrolysis The effect of reaction time on the degree of hydrolysis during reactions was carried out in the presence of alkali catalyst, NaOH with catalyst ratio 0.06. Fig. 3 shows that the degree of hydrolysis increases with the reaction time. Longer reaction times enable more hydroxyl groups to be formed in the polymer. The presence of more hydroxyl group contributes to the autocatalytic effect of the reaction [3,4]. Autocatalytic effect is present in a reaction when the product of the reaction itself acts as a catalyst to the reaction and increases the rate of reaction. In the hydrolysis reaction of polyvinyl acetate with alkali catalyst, the hydroxyl group that replaces the acetate groups functions as a catalyst itself. Thus, the rate of hydrolysis increases with the reaction time in producing more hydrolyzed PVA. For a reaction of 20 min, it was observed as the minimum amount of time for the cloudy solution to appear, indicating the presence of PVA. This means mere 20 min reaction time is insufficient to hydrolyze the polyvinyl acetate to higher degrees. As shown in Fig. 3, even at 70 °C reaction temperature for 20 min reaction time, the PVA produced was just 78.9% hydrolyzed. PVA with lower degree of hydrolysis is not widely used in the industry, as it will face difficulties to dissolve in aqueous solution. Hence, in order to achieve an 85% partially hydrolysis PVA, the reaction need to be carried out at 70 °C with at least 50 min in the present study. Therefore, the industry standard intermediately hydrolyzed (93–97%) and fully hydrolyzed (98–99%) PVA [4] can be obtained at reaction time at/or longer than 60 min with temperature at/or higher than 60 °C."
8,Effect of catalyst ratio on degree of hydrolysis,"3.3 Effect of catalyst ratio on degree of hydrolysis The effect of catalyst ratio for NaOH to polyvinyl acetate on the degree of hydrolysis of PVA produced was investigated at 70 °C for 40 min. The influences of catalyst ratio were studied in the range from 0.04–0.08 and the results are shown in Fig. 4 . It is clearly found that the degree of hydrolysis of PVA increases with the increasing of catalyst ratio at constant temperature and time. The trend is expected as higher catalyst ratio tends to decrease the activation energy which leads to higher reaction rate and higher degree of hydrolysis [4]. In the present study ranges, a slight increase of catalyst ratio from 0.04 to 0.08 increased the degree of hydrolysis from 78.1% to 92.8% at 70 °C for 40 min. Herein, in addition to reaction temperature and time, catalyst ratio can also be used to control the degree of hydrolysis during reaction."
9,Effect of stirring speed on degree of hydrolysis,"3.4 Effect of stirring speed on degree of hydrolysis The effect of stirring speed on the degree of hydrolysis of PVA was also studied at 70 °C for 40 min. The reactions were conducted by varying the stirring speed within the range of 350 and 1200 rpm. Fig. 5 shows the effect of stirring speed on degree of hydrolysis of PVA at 70 °C for 40 min. In general, the degree of hydrolysis increases with the stirring speed. Nevertheless, the increment in degree of hydrolysis with the stirring speed is relatively slow when comparing to the effect of catalyst ratio under the same reaction time and temperature. This can be seen when the stirring speed increase about three times from 350 rpm to 900 rpm, the degree of hydrolysis has only increase less than 5% from 80% to 84%. This effect is inferior comparing to the effect of catalyst ratio (Fig. 5) in which the degree of hydrolysis increases about 19% when the catalyst ratio was doubled. Another interesting observation in Fig. 5 is that further increase of stirring speed from 1100 to 1200 rpm did not further increase the degree of hydrolysis which were both around 93%. This phenomenon could be due to the repulsive forces between the hydroxyl groups of the polymer with the methanol molecules surrounding due to high degree of hydrolysis (close to 100%) of the polymer. This force was high enough to prevent further hydrolysis of the remaining acetyl group with even higher mechanical stirring vibration."
10,Different type of catalyst on hydrolysis reaction,"3.5 Different type of catalyst on hydrolysis reaction Both alkali (NaOH) or acid (HCl) was used as a catalyst to study their effect on the PVA produced. The temperature and time of reaction were compared at 60 °C for 60 min for both of the catalysts. In the presence of NaOH as a catalyst in methanol, the operating condition was sufficient for the reaction to proceed to produce a cloudy solution and eventually titration revealed that 92% hydrolyzed PVA was produced. In the case of HCl catalyst, it was observed that the solution remained transparent and colorless even after 60 min of reaction. When some amount of distilled water was added to the mixture, the mixture turned cloudy producing PVA. This scenario showed that the presence of water is required for the complete dissociation of the acid in order to proceed to the reaction that produces PVA, which is insoluble in methanol. In pure methanol, HCl acts as a weak acid and only partially dissociates [13]. Thus, water was added to the mixture with an acid catalyst at 50 vol% of water and 50 vol% of HCl. The PVA formed was a sticky gel-like lump. This sticky scenario made the resulted PVA difficult to be further tested or analyzed. It was believed that partially hydrolyzed PVA had formed. It was also observed that, when the reaction was carried out with acid catalyst purely in water (in the absence of methanol), the reaction was totally inhibited because polyvinyl acetate is insoluble in water. Since polyvinyl acetate could not dissolve, the homogenous reaction between polymer and methanol that occurs in the liquid phase could not happen. Thus, the amount of water added for the acid catalyst reaction should be given additional attention because it must be appropriate to avoid zero reaction or lumps of PVA would be produced [11]."
11,Effect of degree of hydrolysis on solubility of PVA,"3.6 Effect of degree of hydrolysis on solubility of PVA The degree of hydrolysis in PVA highly influences the solubility of PVA in water. The solubility test was carried out by measuring the time taken for PVA with different degree of hydrolysis to dissolve in water at 40 °C. The result is shown in Fig. 6 . As the degree of hydrolysis increases, the time which is taken for PVA to dissolve in water decreases indicating that the degree of hydrolysis and solubility of PVA in water are directly proportional but only to certain hydrolysis degree. From Fig. 6, one can see that the time taken for PVA to dissolve in water is reducing from a 75% degree of hydrolysis PVA to 91–92% degree of hydrolysis PVA. This observation is similar to that reported by Chaouat et al. [14] in which the best solubility of PVA can be achieved with an 87–89% degree of hydrolysis. In the present study, the best solubility obtained was at 91.5% degree of hydrolysis where the PVA dissolves in approximately one hour. The increasing number of the hydroxyl group in PVA with a higher degree of hydrolysis enables more hydrogen bonds to be formed between water molecules and the polymer leading to the hike up of solubility of PVA. However, at a higher degree of hydrolysis above 91.5%, the dissolution time of PVA increases (Fig. 6). At a higher degree of hydrolysis, there are more hydroxyl groups within the PVA polymer. This cause an increase in intra- and intermolecular PVA polymer-polymer hydrogen bonding. These strong bonds prevent the PVA polymer from forming bonds with water molecules around, therefore become less soluble in water. Similar results were also reported elsewhere [13,14]. Though the solubility decreases beyond 91.5% degree of hydrolysis, the solubility of PVA is still better than that of PVAs with degree of hydrolysis below 85% in the study range."
12,Effect of degree of hydrolysis on properties of PVA,"3.7 Effect of degree of hydrolysis on properties of PVA Fig. 7 shows the surface morphology of PVA samples obtained under different operating conditions with different degrees of hydrolysis. Fig. 7(a) depicts a rough surface while Fig. 7(b) shows a smoother surface. This scenario should be due to the difference in the degree of hydrolysis. A higher degree of hydrolysis in PVA tends to have a higher degree of crystallinity because there is a lesser number of acetate groups and thus smoother surfaces [1]. Hence, Fig. 7(b) shows a smoother surface as the sample is PVA of 97.6% hydrolyzed compared to 82.6% hydrolyzed in Fig. 7(a). Anyhow, PVA in Fig. 7(b) does show some roughness. This could be due to the reaction carried out by using the alkali catalyst, NaOH. The rate of hydrolysis in the presence of alkali catalyst is faster than the acid catalyst. The rapid reaction causes difficulties in producing PVA with smoother and more regular surface [15]. Thus, there is surface irregularity even in PVA of a higher degree of hydrolysis. Industrial PVA is usually referred to as semi-crystalline because the common catalyst used in the industry is NaOH and its usage produces PVA with a mixed amorphous-crystalline surface. An image of a commercially available PVA sample with 96% hydrolyzed (M.W. 95,000) is shown in Fig. 7(d). Fig. 7(c) shows the micrograph of PVA which was 77% hydrolyzed. The image has some bits of crystal structures indicating the presence of sodium acetate [16]. Sodium acetate is actually a major impurity in PVA which is prepared by using the base catalyst. In such a case, the catalyst NaOH is consumed in the reaction. It tends to react with acetic acid, a side product formed during reaction, into sodium acetate [17]. The presence of element sodium in the recovered product was confirmed by EDX (Fig. 8 ). NaOH is a strong base while methanol is a weak base. At low temperature (40 °C), sodium hydroxide is more reactive compare to methanol to react with acetate end at polyvinyl acetate. Therefore, significant sodium acetate salts were observed as shown in Fig. 7(c). In this case, the operating conditions (<60 °C) might promote some of this reaction and thus led to less NaOH to remain in the solution during the reaction. Hence, the rate of reaction is reduced to lower catalytic effect compare to that of other reactions. Sodium acetate is slightly soluble in methanol at room temperature and decompose when near 60 °C. This explained the reason why the needle like crystal structure only observed in the PVA produced at low temperature (<60 °C). The presence of sodium acetate in PVA accelerates the thermal degradation of PVA which makes the production of PVA based product highly sensitive to high temperatures [18]. Thus, the sodium acetate content of PVA needs to be removed in the industry before further usage. Fig. 8 shows the EDX results showing the elemental composition of PVA samples. The EDX shows that the composition of carbon atom is the highest. Carbon content in PVA with 82.6% hydrolyzed (Fig. 8(a)) and PVA with 97.6% hydrolyzed (Fig. 8(b)) are found to be 54 wt% and 53 wt%, respectively. These numbers matched the values estimated theoretically by using polyvinyl acetate of M.W. 100,000 (86.09 g/mol per unit molar mass) and being hydrolyzed to 82.6 and 97.6%. Theoretically calculated values are 54.8 wt% and 54.5 wt% respectively. Aluminum and chlorine in Fig. 8(a) was believed to be the contaminant in the sample. PVA products were also characterized by FTIR. Fig. 9 depicts three spectrums of PVA synthesized under different operating conditions, which are 35 °C for 40 min with catalyst ratio of 0.06; 70 °C for 60 min with catalyst ratio of 0.06 and 70 °C for 40 min with catalyst ratio of 0.04. These PVA product samples were hydrolyzed at 76%, 96% and 78%, respectively. These spectrums have similar functional groups. The broad band between 3700 and 4000 cm−1 indicates the presence of typical strong hydroxyl groups in all PVA samples which are O–H stretching band. The peaks that appeared at 3200–3500 cm−1 corresponds to hydrogen bonded band which was due to intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonding that are likely to occur among PVA chains because of high hydrophilic forces [19]. The vibrational band between 2900 and 3000 cm−1, ascribed to v (C–H) stretching from alkyl groups. The bands between 1800 and 1940 cm−1 are associated to the stretching bands of ester groups [3]. The peak around 1630 to 1750 cm-1 are due to stretching of C=O and C–O which are related to carbonyl group of the residual acetate remaining in PVA after saponification reaction of polyvinyl acetate. The absorption peaks between 1300 and 1500 cm−1 are associated with CH and CH2 deformation vibrations. The bands between 760–930 cm−1 attributed to C–O–C ring vibration due to motion of the carbon skeleton of PVA."
13,Conclusion,"This study was conducted to analyze the effects of reaction temperature, reaction time, catalyst ratio and stirring speed during reaction on the degree of hydrolysis in PVA synthesized. All these factors were found to have positive influence toward the degree of hydrolysis in PVA synthesized but with different degree. The solubility of PVA increased with the degree of hydrolysis but only up to 91%. Thus, it is important to choose and perform the reaction at suitable operating condition in order to synthesize PVA with required degree of hydrolysis. The degree of hydrolysis of PVA is vital as it affects the properties of the resulted PVA directly, including solubility in water and biodegradability."
