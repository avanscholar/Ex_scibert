0,Introduction,"In 2019 the tequila industry used approximately 1,342,600 tons of agave, generating about 537,000 tons of bagasse as a residue [1]. The large quantity of this residue, the limited use as feed for animals, and the improper use in agricultural lands, have raised a serious problem of waste management in the tequila industry. An alternative to address this environmental concern is the use of agave bagasse for production of biofuels like ethanol, methane, and hydrogen (H2). Hydrogen stands out from other options due to its high energy content (142 kJ/g), its combustion produces only water, and the possibility of its direct use in internal combustion engines or fuel cells [2]. H2 can be produced biologically through dark fermentation, which is the anaerobic conversion of carbohydrate-rich organic matter into short-chain organic acids, alcohols, H2 and CO2, principally [3]. Agave bagasse is a lignocellulosic residue whose composition differs according to its origin. Roughly, the cellulose content may range from 53% to 30%, the hemicellulose content from 54% to 32% and lignin content from 14% to 7% [4,5]. Due to the high content of cellulose and hemicellulose, the agave bagasse is considered a carbohydrate rich residue that can be further transformed into fermentable carbohydrates through a suitable hydrolysis process (saccharification) for H2 production. It is worth to note that, given that agave pinnacles are subjected to physical and thermal processes during tequila manufacturing, no additional pretreatments are required previous to the saccharification process [6]. In contrast to other saccharification processes, enzymatic processes are characterized by their high specificity; consequently, they do not produce inhibitory compounds (furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural, acetic acid, phenols), which can be detrimental for dark fermentation [5,7]. Readily commercial enzymatic preparations have been widely used for saccharification of lignocellulosic materials [8–11]. In particular, lignocellulose-specialized enzymes such as Celluclast 1.5 L, Macerex PM, Ctec2, Htec2, β-glucosidase 188, have been used for the saccharification of non-pretreated agave bagasse, with saccharification yields between 0.19 and 0.42 g carbohydrates/g bagasse [12–14]. From these commercial enzymes, Celluclast 1.5 L agave bagasse hydrolysates have been successfully used for the production of H2 in batch [9,11,15] and continuous systems [16–18]. Interestingly, previous studies reported significant improvements in carbohydrates release and H2 production, using Celluclast 1.5 L in combination with another lignocellulose-specialized enzyme Viscozyme L [11,18]. For instance, Galindo-Hernández et al. [11] reported an increase in the total sugar yield by 2-fold using an enzymatic mixture (cellulases -hemicellulases), evidencing a synergism. Furthermore, the hydrolysate obtained from the enzyme mixture improved 1.5 times the overall yield of H2 production. Despite the promising results of using Celluclast 1.5 L and the combination of Celluclast 1.5 L and Viscozyme L, the application at the regional Mexican scale could be hindered by their cost and availability. Therefore, alternative non-lignocellulose-specialized enzymatic preparations found in the local market have been recently investigated [18,19]. In most of the cases, such enzymes were not designed ex professo for being used with lignocellulosic materials; nevertheless, their enzymatic activities make them attractive for such purpose [19]. Accordingly, it is of great importance to investigate new alternatives of non-lignocellulose-specialized enzymes that allow achieving H2 productivities similar or even greater than those obtained with specialized enzymes. Cellulase 50 XL is an enzymatic preparation widely used in the Mexican food industry that has been recently evaluated for the saccharification of agave bagasse and the production of H2 in batch systems [19]. In particular, the hydrolysates with Cellulase 50 XL have yielded a total carbohydrates concentration of 9.3 g/L and a H2 production up to 1.65 L H2/L-d (2.30 mol H2/mol hexose consumed), these values were similar to those obtained with Celluclast 1.5 L and Stonezyme agave bagasse hydrolysates [19]. So far, the performance of Cellulase 50 XL agave bagasse hydrolysates in continuous H2 production has not been evaluated. Therefore, in the present work, agave bagasse hydrolysates obtained with Cellulase 50 XL, individually and in mixture with Viscozyme L, were evaluated for the continuous H2 production in a suspended-biomass reactor. Finally, to analyze and summarize the recent advances in H2 production with enzymatic hydrolysates of agave bagasse, the results from this and previous studies with cellulosic and alternative non-lignocellulose-specialized enzymes were gathered and compared."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Agave bagasse preparation,"2.1 Agave bagasse preparation Agave bagasse was provided by Casa Herradura (Amatitán, Jalisco, Mexico). Immediately after receiving the material, it was sundried to avoid its decomposition. Then, it was ground in a knife mill to reduce its particle size. The resulting material was then washed three times (1 h of duration each time) with a tap water: bagasse ratio of 7:1 (volume:volume), with the objective of eliminating the soluble residual organic matter. Finally, the agave bagasse was sundried for a second time and sieved in a mesh to obtain fibers of 0.5–4 cm."
3,Saccharification of agave bagasse,"2.2 Saccharification of agave bagasse Two commercial enzymes were used for the hydrolysis of agave bagasse: i) Cellulase 50 XL (ENZIQUIM, Mexico) and ii) Viscozyme L (Novozymes, Denmark). Enzymatic activities of Cellulase 50 XL were as follows: cellulase, 1960 FPU/mg protein; 1–4-β-endoglucanase, 1280 EGU/mg protein; β-glucosidase, 70,588 U/mg protein; and xylanase, 7.1 × 10 6 U/mg protein. The enzymatic activities of Viscozyme L were as follows: cellulase, 118 FPU/mg protein; 1–4-β-endoglucanase, 21 EGU/mg protein; β-glucosidase 87 U/mg protein; and xylanase, 4231 U/mg protein. The first hydrolysis was carried out with Cellulase 50 XL at a final concentration of 0.53 mg protein/L (12.54 FPU/g dry bagasse). The second hydrolysis was prepared with a mixture of Cellulase 50 XL (same concentration as the individual hydrolysis) and Viscozyme L at a concentration of 0.1 mg protein/L (0.14 FPU/g dry bagasse). In both cases, agave bagasse was dispersed at a concentration of 87.7 g/L in citrate buffer (50 mM and pH 6). Both hydrolyses were carried out in a 10 L (8 L working volume) stirred tank reactor (Prendo model U1 TPLC/FAM, Mexico). The temperature and agitation of the hydrolysis reactor were controlled at 45 °C and 100 rpm, respectively. As the reaction times of both hydrolysis were unknown at such scale, the release of carbohydrates and chemical oxygen demand (COD) over time was determined in the first three batches of each enzymatic hydrolysis to establish the optimal reaction times. At the end of each hydrolysis, the hydrolysates were filtered through cotton-cloth to eliminate large fibers of agave bagasse and the excess of solids. The filtered liquid was stored at 4 ºC before its use in dark fermentation."
4,Inoculum and mineral medium,"2.3 Inoculum and mineral medium The inoculum source was anaerobic granular sludge from a full-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor treating tequila vinasses from Casa Herradura (Amatitán, Jalisco, Mexico). The sludge was heat-treated at 105 ºC for 24 h [16]. Afterward, it was ground in a ceramic mortar and sieved to a particle size of 850 µm [19]. The content of total suspended solids (TSS) and volatile suspended solids (VSS) of the sludge after pretreatment were 0.96 g/g sludge and 0.9 g/g sludge, respectively. The mineral medium added to the reactors was modified from Contreras-Dávila et al. [16] to contain (g/L): NH4H2PO4, 4.5; Na2HPO4, 0.635; K2HPO4, 0.125; MgCl2·6H2O. 0.1; ZnCl2, 0.075; FeCl2·4H2O, 0.021; MnCl2.4H2O, 0.011; CuCl2·2H2O, 0.0035."
5,Experimental set-up,"2.4 Experimental set-up The fermentation experiments were carried out in a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) (Applikon model Z310210011, The Netherlands) with a working volume of 1 L. Stirring (300 rpm), temperature (37 ºC), and pH (5.5), were automatically controlled. The reactors were started up with inoculum and substrate concentrations of 4.5 g VSS/L of heat-treated sludge and 10 g COD/L of enzymatic hydrolysate, respectively. To set up anaerobic conditions, the reactors were flushed with a mixture of CO2/N2 (80:20) for 10 min. The CSTR systems were operated in batch mode for 24 h and changed to a continuous regime. Two independent CSTR systems were set up and operated: CSTR-I fed with hydrolysates prepared with Cellulase 50 XL, and CSTR-II fed with hydrolysates prepared with the mixture Cellulase 50 XL - Viscozyme L. The organic loading rates (OLR) in CSTR-I ranged from 44 - 120 g COD/L-d with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 6 - 10 h; whereas in CSTR-II the OLR was between 52 - 80 g COD/L-d with a fixed HRT of 6 h. In all cases, the changes in the OLR were applied with an increase of the substrate concentration, except for the stages VIII and IX of the CSTR-I where the change in OLR was in function of the HRT (fixed substrate concentration of 30 g COD/L). Each OLR condition was maintained for at least 20 HRT and steady-state conditions were considered when the variation of the volumetric H2 production rate (VHPR) was less than 10% during three consecutive days. The performance of both reactors was evaluated by the H2 content, VHPR, specific H2 production yield (L H2/kg bagasse), carboxylates production, total carbohydrates removal, COD removal, and VSS."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods Gas production was measured by a liquid displacement device (Prendo model MVG-10, Mexico), and the composition was determined by gas chromatography using a thermal conductivity detector [16]. All gas volumes are reported at standard conditions (1 atm and 273.15 K). Parameters including COD, VSS, and TSS, were measured according to the standard methods 5220, 2540-B, and 2450-E, respectively [20]. The concentration of total carbohydrates was determined through the phenol-sulfuric method [21]. The concentrations of the main carboxylates (formate, acetate, propionate, lactate, and butyrate) were quantified by capillary electrophoresis as reported elsewhere [22]."
7,Statistical analysis,"2.6 Statistical analysis One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the effects of operating conditions on hydrogen production. The effect was considered to be significant at a p value lower than 0.05. The response variable was verified to be normally distributed through graphical inspection (q-q plot). The heteroscedasticity was also verified with residual plots. Alternatively, the non-parametric test of Kruskal-Wallis was used. All statistical analysis were conducted with R software [23]."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Saccharification of agave bagasse,"3.1 Saccharification of agave bagasse Agave bagasse hydrolysates were obtained with two different enzymatic preparations: an individual enzyme (Cellulase 50 XL) and a mixture of enzymes (Cellulase 50 XL - Viscozyme L). In both cases the saccharification of agave bagasse started immediately after the addition of the enzyme. According to the profiles of COD and total carbohydrates concentration (data not shown), the hydrolysis ended within the first 100 min. Therefore, subsequent hydrolysates were prepared with 1.5 h of hydrolysis time. The hydrolysis time was remarkably shorter than other experiments reported for agave bagasse enzymatic hydrolysis, where hydrolysis times were between 6 and 12 h [18]. A short reaction time could reduce hydrolysis costs and, consequently, the cost of H2 production. Moreover, in terms of reaction times, the present results are closer than other saccharification strategies such as acid, alkaline, biological, steam explosion, and ozone, among others [7,9,24,25]. Table 1 presents the characterization of the enzymatic hydrolysates. The results indicate that the use of Viscozyme L, as an accessory enzyme, increased the release of COD (22.2%) and carbohydrates (28.5%) from agave bagasse compared to individual Cellulase 50 XL. The positive effect of Viscozyme L as an accessory enzyme was previously reported in mixtures with Celluclast 1.5 L [11,18]. Galindo-Hernández et al. [11] concluded that the addition of Viscozyme L had a synergistic effect on both carbohydrates and COD release. Additionally, other authors have described similar phenomena using different enzymes, suggesting that simultaneous hydrolysis enhances the hemicellulose hydrolysis, increasing the total concentration of glucose and xylose in the hydrolysates [26,27]. Table 1 also shows the hydrolysis yield from both experiments. Binary hydrolysate (Cellulase 50 XL - Viscozyme L) showed a hydrolysis yield of 0.23 g total carbohydrates/g agave bagasse, which was 27.7% higher than the one obtained with the individual hydrolysate (Cellulase 50 XL). These yields were comparable to those reported previously for enzymatic (0.15 0.27 g total carbohydrates/g agave bagasse) and ozonated-enzymatic hydrolysates (~ 0.20 g total carbohydrates/g TS) in agave bagasse [7,16–18]. However, the binary hydrolysate yield was remarkably higher than those found with rumen fluid (~ 0.01 g total carbohydrates/g TS) [7], and steam-explosion agave bagasse hydrolysates (~ 0.15 g total carbohydrates/g TS) [7]. By comparing our results versus acid hydrolysis, using HCl resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in the hydrolysis yield [7,15]. Nonetheless, with the acid pretreatment, several compounds such as furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural, phenols, acetic and propionic acids, can be formed at inhibitory concentrations for fermentative microorganisms [7,15,28,29]. The presence of these compounds has been reported recently also in hydrolysates obtained by ozone pretreatment and steam-explosion of agave bagasse [7]."
10,H2 production from hydrolysates obtained with Cellulase 50 XL,"3.2 H2 production from hydrolysates obtained with Cellulase 50 XL The CSTR-I, fed with hydrolysates obtained with Cellulase 50 XL, was successfully operated for 70 days at different OLR and HRT; the operational conditions and reactor performance are shown in Fig. 1 and Table 2. During the whole reactor operation, the H2 percentage was 44.9 ± 3.5% on average, while methane was not detected. As shown in Fig. 1A, the increase of OLR from 44 g COD/L-d (stage I) to 100 g COD/L-d (stage V) resulted in the rise of the VHPR from 3.7 ± 0.2 L H2/L-d to 9.9 ± 0.1 L H2/L-d. The increase of the VHPR was accompanied by a parallel increament of the carbohydrates consumption rate from 21.5 ± 0.1 (stage I) to 48.9 ± 1.0 g total carbohydrates/L-d (stage V). In stage VI, the OLR was further increased to 120 g COD/L-d, i.e. the hydrolysate was fed without dilution. At such conditions and considering the whole stage period (n = 7 days), the VHPR and carbohydrates consumption rate were 10.8 ± 1.0 L H2/L-d and 52.3 ± 5.4 g total carbohydrates/L-d, respectively. The VHPR values obtained in this work were in the same range as those reported for hydrolysates prepared with Celluclast 1.5 L - Viscozyme L (13 ± 0.1 L H2/L-d); however, this VHPR was obtained at an OLR of 90 g COD/L-d with a carbohydrate consumption rate of 26.2 g total carbohydrates/L-d [18]. Nevertheless, both the VHPR and carbohydrates consumption rate decreased unexpectedly after reaching maximum values at day 48. Possibly, this occurred due to substrate overloading, product inhibition (>15 g total carboxylates/L were obtained in that stage), or both. It could even be due to inhibition by the presence of components in the commercial enzyme [30,31]. Substrate overloading is a common problem reported in CSTR systems at OLR > 140 g COD/L-d and TRH < 8 h [22,32]. In the case of carboxylates concentration, it has been reported that the presence of acetic and butyric acids at total concentrations of 25 mM (1.5 g/L acetate + 2.2 g/L butyrate) decreased the H2 yield by 24% at pH 5.5 [33]. The relatively high carboxylates concentrations, found in stage VI, is a likely explanation for the decrease of the VHPR and carbohydrates consumption. In stage VII, the OLR was changed to 60 g COD/L-d (same as stage III) to restore the system performance, obtaining a VHPR of 5.3 ± 0.1 L H2/L-d and an average carbohydrates consumption rate of 31.6 ± 0.3 g total carbohydrates/L-d. These values indicated the recovery of the fermentation performance. Moreover, to further investigate the H2 production performance with undiluted hydrolysates, in stages VIII and IX, the HRT was changed to 10 h and 8 h, respectively. In stage VIII, at an OLR of 72 g COD/L-d, the VHPR was 4.7 ± 0.1 L H2/L-d with a carbohydrates consumption rate of 31.7 ± 0.6 g total carbohydrates/L-d. Finally, in stage IX, at an OLR of 90 g COD/L-d, the VHPR was 5.5 ± 0.1 L H2/L-d with a carbohydrates consumption rate of 35.5 ± 0.4 g total carbohydrates/L-d. In sum, the operation at HRT > 6 h resulted in VHPR lower than those obtained at comparable OLR with HRT of 6 h. Probably, this result was associated with the presence of undesired species having detrimental impact on H2 production [34]. This hypothesis is consistent with the increase of formate and lactate in stages VIII and IX compared with previous stages at similar OLR (Stages III-V) (Table 2). The specific H2 production yield is the relation between the volume of H2 that is produced per day and the mass of hydrolyzed agave bagasse consumed per day. As observed in Fig. 1B, the specific H2 production yield was between 18.8 and 32.5 L H2/kg agave bagasse, with a similar trend to that observed with VHPR. A maximum value of 32.5 ± 0.1 L H2/kg agave bagasse was obtained at an OLR of 100 g COD/L-d (stage V). In general, the yields observed were below the values reported with the obtained hydrolysates using Celluclast 1.5 L (45–105 L H2/kg agave bagasse, prepared with 3.5 – 4% w/v) [16,17]. The specific H2 production yield is directly affected by the VHPR and the COD concentration obtained in the enzymatic hydrolysis. In turn, the obtained COD in each hydrolysis is affected by the concentration of agave bagasse used in each experiment. Acetate, butyrate, and formate were the main carboxylates produced during the CSTR-I operation (Table 2). The average concentrations of acetate and butyrate were found in the ranges of 2.1 – 5.4 and 0.7 – 4.4 g/L, respectively. The production of both acetate and butyrate was significantly linked with VHPR (acetate: F1,8 =76.97, R2 =0.89, p < 0.05; butyrate: F1,8 =156, R2 =0.95, p < 0.05), OLR (acetate: F1,8 =113.3, R2 =0.93, p < 0.05; butyrate: F1,8 =225.4, R2 =0.96, p < 0.05), and the carbohydrates consumption rate (acetate: F1,8 =143, R2 =0.94, p < 0.05; butyrate: F1,8 =235, R2 =0.96 p < 0.05). Moreover, the acetate/butyrate ratio (Table 2) was negatively associated with the increase of VHPR (F1,8 =13.24, R2 =0.58 p < 0.05), OLR (F1,8 =16, R2 =0.63, p < 0.05), and carbohydrates consumption rate (F1,8 =17.25, R2 =0.64, p < 0.05). Overall, the behavior of acetate and butyrate production suggests that both carboxylates are favored by the increase of OLR; however, the increase of butyrate production was higher than acetate. The increase of butyrate is possibly linked with inhibition phenomena caused by the accumulation of H2. Previous studies showed that the increase of OLR often leads to an increase of VHPR, but it also leads to the accumulation of dissolved H2, which is a pivotal factor impacting the metabolic routes of dark fermentation [35,36]. In particular, most probably, the increase of dissolved H2 causes the partial inhibition of H2 production from NADH. Theoretical estimations indicate that the synthesis of H2 from NADH (at equal concentrations of the oxidized and reduced forms of the electron donors) is not feasible at partial pressures > 60 Pa. Therefore, alternative routes for the deposition of electrons from NADH are used. The butyrate pathway, for example, requires 2 mol of acetyl-CoA (precursor of acetate) and 2 mol of NADH. This latter case would lead to a decrease of the acetate to butyrate ratio. The synthesis of formate was also associated with the OLR, carbohydrates consumption rate, and VHPR. For instance, a maximum formate concentration of 5.8 ± 0.3 g/L was found at an OLR of 120 g COD/L-d. It is suggested that the production of formate was possibly linked with a low-activity of the enzyme formate-lyase involved in the transformation of formate to H2 and CO2, which is associated with the accumulation of dissolved H2 [19,37]. Moreover, formate production can also occur during the first steps of homoacetogenesis (acetate production via the consumption of H2 and CO2), which has also been linked with the increase of dissolved H2 [38]."
11,H2 production from hydrolysates obtained with the mixture of enzymes,"3.3 H2 production from hydrolysates obtained with the mixture of enzymes The CSTR-II, fed with hydrolysates obtained with a mixture of Cellulase 50 XL and Viscozyme L, was successfully operated for 35 days. Fig. 2 and Table 3 show the operational conditions and reactor performance. In all stages during the CSTR-II operation, the H2 concentration in the gas stream was 46.8 ± 1.9% in all stages, except for stage VI, where the concentration of H2 was 39 ± 1.5%. Methane was not detected throughout the whole reactor operation. In stage I (60 g COD/L-d), the average VHPR was 4.0 ± 0.1 L H2/L-d, while in stage II (70 g COD/L-d) the average VHPR was 4.2 ± 0.1 L H2/L-d (Fig. 2A). The average carbohydrates consumption rates in these stages were 26 ± 0.1 and 31.2 ± 0.3 g total carbohydrates/L-d, respectively. In stage III (80 g COD/L-d), the VHPR started to drop from 4.05 L H2/L-d at the beginning of the stage to 2.9 ± 0.6 L H2/L-d after six days of operation. Interestingly, the carbohydrates consumption rate remained about 33.9 ± 0.4 g total carbohydrates/L-d (Fig. 2B). To recover the H2 production, in stage IV the OLR was set to 52 g COD/L-d. In this stage, the VHPR was 1.8 ± 0.1 L H2/L-d with a stable carbohydrates consumption rate of 23.5 ± 0.1 g total carbohydrates/L-d. The decrease of the H2 productivities observed in stage III could indicate a possible shift in the metabolic pathways to non-H2-producing routes. The most common routes reported previously are solventogenesis (production of ethanol, butanol, and acetone) and the formation of medium-chain carboxylates [39,40]. Given the cellular retention time (the same that the HRT) in our system, the production routes of ethanol, butanol, and acetone, are more probable [41–43]. Once the CSTR-II performance stabilized, the OLR of 70 and 80 g COD/L-d in stages V and VI, respectively, were evaluated again. The VHPR during stages V and VI were 3.1 ± 0.1 and 2.1 ± 0.1 L H2/L-d, respectively. These values were considerably lower than those obtained in stage II and III, respectively. However, the consumption of carbohydrates was quite similar to that observed in such stages (31.7 ± 0.6 and 36.6 ± 0.4 g total carbohydrates/L-d, respectively). Besides the possible appearance of non-H2-producing routes, the microbial communities could have suffered irreversible changes in their composition during stage III that hindered the recovery of H2 production performance in later stages. However, further experimental work will be required to test both hypotheses. The specific H2 production yield was in the range of 13.0 ± 0.3–25.2 ± 0.4 L H2/kg agave bagasse (Fig. 2B) following a similar trend to the observed with VHPR. These values were quite lower than those obtained in CSTR-I, indicating that the addition of Viscozyme L had little to any effect on the efficiency of dark fermentation. The carboxylates produced during the operation of CSTR-II are shown in Table 3. Acetate and butyrate were the main carboxylates produced, with concentrations ranging from 1.0 ± 0.1–2.7 ± 0.2 g/L and 1.00 ± 0.1–2.4 ± 0.1 g/L, respectively. These concentrations were considerably lower than those reported for CSTR-I, where (at similar OLR) acetate and butyrate were found in concentrations between 4.2 – 5.4 g/L and 2.5 – 3.7 g/L, respectively. The low concentrations of acetate and butyrate (products of main H2-producing pathways) were consistent with the low VHPR observed. In contrast to CSTR-I, no clear relationship was found between OLR, VHPR, and the acetate to butyrate ratio (Table 3). Moreover, formate and lactate were found during the whole operation of CSTR-II. Formate was found at concentrations in the range of 0.2 ± 0.1 – 1.2 ± 0.4 g/L (except stage V). In general, the concentrations were lower than those observed in CSTR-I (at similar OLR). Since formate is usually associated with the accumulation of H2 in the fermentation broth [38], the lower concentrations are possibly a direct consequence of the lower VHPR observed in CSTR-II. On the other hand, lactate was observed in all stages of operation at concentrations ranging from 0.7 ± 0.2 – 2.3 ± 0.3 g/L. The production of lactate indicated the presence of lactic acid bacteria, which are microorganisms associated with substrate competition and production of inhibitory compounds (bacteriocins) [38,44]; both are detrimental for H2 production. Previous studies report that the presence of lactic acid bacteria can be associated with stages of high H2 production, where H2 and carboxylates are accumulated up to inhibitory concentrations (for H2-producing bacteria); at such conditions, H2-producing bacteria are suppressed, leading to the establishment of other non-H2-producing microorganisms, mainly lactic acid bacteria [38]. Nevertheless, the conditions of CSTR-II were distant from being inhibitory for H2-producing bacteria, while lactate was present during the whole reactor operation, not only in specific stages. Therefore, we hypothesize that the production of lactate is possibly linked to the presence of substrates not consumed by H2-producing bacteria but by lactic acid bacteria. Similar investigations in CSTR systems operated at OLR between 30 100 g COD/L-d already reported the coexistence between lactic acid bacteria (genus Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Sporolactobacillus, principally) and H2 producing bacteria (genus Clostridium, Enterobacter, principally) [32,38]. However, despite the possible positive coexistence of dark fermentation and lactic acid fermentation, the efficiency of carbohydrates removal was below 83% (Table 3), suggesting the presence of some carbohydrates that the microbial community developed in the CSTR-II could not metabolize. Overall, since using Viscozyme L as an accessory enzyme improved the release of total carbohydrates and COD in the hydrolysates (Section 3.1), it was expected that the CSTR could be operated at high OLR (e.g. > 100 g COD/L-d). Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that the use of Viscozyme L, to enhance the release of total carbohydrates during the hydrolysis, was not directly linked with H2 production performance. Conversely, the present results suggest that the difference in H2 production performance is probably due to the hydrolysates composition and its specific characteristics, such as the polymerization degree of the carbohydrates released in the hydrolysis and the components of the commercial enzymes. In particular, it has been reported that glucose and xylose are the two major monosaccharides released in enzymatic hydrolysis of agave species, with glucose: xylose ratios between 1:2 and 1:5 [14,45]. However, glucose and xylose concentrations corresponded to approximately 40 – 50% of the total sugars released during the enzymatic saccharification. The remaining percentage can include other monosaccharides (e.g. mannose, galactose, fructose), disaccharides (e.g. cellobiose) and polysaccharides (e.g. oligosaccharides, xylo-oligosaccharides) [14,46]."
12,Comprehensive analysis of H2 production from diverse enzymatic agave bagasse hydrolysates,"3.4 Comprehensive analysis of H2 production from diverse enzymatic agave bagasse hydrolysates To compare the results obtained in this work with those previously reported, Fig. 3 and Table 4 present the analysis of the results. Table 4 shows the characteristics of different hydrolysates and the OLRs at which the maximum VHPR and yields were reached. Fig. 3 presents the VHPR and specific H2 yield obtained with various hydrolysates at different carbohydrate loading rates. VHPR and specific H2 production yield are presented as a function of the total carbohydrates because dark fermentation is carried out through the consumption of carbohydrates, mainly monosaccharides (glucose, xylose, among others) [47]. As shown in Fig. 3A, a maximum average VHPR of 13 L H2/L-d was reached with the hydrolysate prepared with the mixture of Celluclast 1.5 L and Viscozyme L [18]. The system fed with hydrolysates prepared with Cellulase 50 XL also showed competitive values of VHPR, with a maximum of 9.94 L H2/L-d. On the contrary, Celluclast 1.5 L [16] and Stonezyme [18] showed VHPR values not higher than 2.53 and 2.2 L H2/L-d, respectively. In general, a positive relationship between carbohydrates loading rate and VHPR was observed in systems using agave bagasse hydrolysates prepared with Celluclast 1.5 L [16], Celluclast 1.5 L - Viscozyme L [18], Stonezyme [18], and Cellulase 50 XL (this study). Conversely, in the case of the systems using agave bagasse hydrolysates prepared with Cellulase 50 XL - Viscozyme L (this study) and Celluclast 1.5 L [17], such a relationship was not observed. Interestingly, a similar carbohydrates loading rate led to remarkably different values of VHPR. For example, at a carbohydrates loading rate of approximately 30 g total carbohydrates/L-d, the VHPR values ranged from 2 to 13.5 L H2/L-d. Considering that the concentration of carbohydrates is often referred to as one of the most determinant factors of dark fermentation (in terms of H2 and carboxylates production), the variance in VHPR was not expected because it is generally assumed that similar concentrations of carbohydrates could lead to similar VHPR. Nevertheless, it seems that the type of carbohydrates present in the hydrolysates is the determining factor. In particular, the presence of oligomers is considered detrimental for H2 production since these compounds are difficult to metabolize by H2-producing bacteria due to their complexity and polymerization degree [46,47]. Therefore, the hydrolysates obtained with enzymes such as Stonezyme, Celluclast 1.5 L, and Cellulase 50 XL - Viscozyme L, possibly had a higher proportion of polymeric carbohydrates than hydrolysates obtained with Celluclast 1.5 L - Viscozyme L and Cellulase 50 XL. However, to sustain this hypothesis, experimental work aimed to determine the carbohydrate composition (monomers, dimers, and oligomers) for each hydrolysate will be required. The specific H2 production yield of each enzymatic agave bagasse hydrolysate is summarized in Fig. 3B. It was observed a positive correlation between carbohydrates loading rate and specific H2 production yield with Celluclast 1.5 - Viscozyme, which was comparable to the observed with the VHPR. Interestingly, a similar relationship was not observed with Cellulase 50 XL hydrolysates. As it was defined in Section 3.2, the specific H2 production yield is a comprehensive term that provides the volume of H2 that can be produced per mass of agave bagasse that is hydrolyzed. Therefore, the differences observed in the specific H2 production yield can be due to the higher concentration of agave bagasse used in the hydrolysis with Cellulase 50 XL (87 g/L) in comparison with Celluclast 1.5 L (35–30 g/L) (Table 4). A possible strategy that could increase the H2 production yield with Cellulase 50 XL hydrolysates is to reduce the concentration of agave bagasse used in the hydrolysis; nevertheless, such strategy may also lead to lower hydrolysis yields (COD and total carbohydrates) while it could reduce the processing capacity of the hydrolysis step. Further work will be required to define the best strategy for agave bagasse hydrolysis in terms of agave processing capacity and specific H2 production yield with Cellulase 50 XL. From our point of view, the H2 production performance and the composition of hydrolysates do not provide enough information to select for a specific hydrolysate; nevertheless, a third factor that could help is the cost of H2 production. For this purpose, a preliminary estimation of the lab-scale H2 production costs was calculated following the methodology proposed by Tapia-Rodriguez et al. [19]. The costs estimation is based on the prices of enzymes, chemicals, water, and electricity required for the hydrolysis and operation stages. It is important to note that, for comparison purposes, the cost of all relevant supplies was standardized for 2020 prices; therefore, the costs calculated in this study can differ from previous reports. In general, the cost of H2 production ranged from 0.6 to 2.3 USD/L H2 ( Fig. 4). For all cases, about 64.6 ± 7.2% of the cost corresponded to the enzymatic preparation, while 33.8 ± 6.8% was attributed to chemicals, and < 2% to water and electricity. In particular, H2 produced with hydrolysates prepared with Stonezyme [18] and Celluclast 1.5 L [16] showed the highest production costs (1.9 and 2.3 USD/L H2, respectively). The cost was consistent with the low VHPR values observed in those systems. On the contrary, the lowest H2 production costs were observed with Celluclast 1.5 L - Viscozyme L [18] and Cellulase 50 XL (this study) (0.6 and 0.7 USD/L H2), which also reported the highest VHPR values. According to the H2 productivities and production costs, using hydrolysates prepared with Celluclast 1.5 L - Viscozyme L is the best option for H2 production from agave bagasse. Using these enzymes is advantageous because they have been specially designed for the saccharification of cellulosic biomass and biofuels production. However, the convenience of Cellulase 50 XL (evaluated in this work) was quite competitive in terms of productivities and costs despite being designed to be used in sectors different from bioenergy (e.g. food markets). Our results indicate that the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass for H2 production is not necessarily limited to the use of specialized-brand enzymes; there are alternatives from other sectors that can be evaluated and optimized. On the other hand, in comparison with the cheapest lab-scale batch system reported by Tapia-Rodríguez et al. [19], the production costs in continuous mode with the different hydrolysates were between 12% and 75% lower. This result is basically due to the lower cost of chemicals and high H2 yields in continuous reactors. In the same way, formal techno-economic evaluations have reported dark fermentative H2 production costs of 2.29 and 1.02 USD/m3 using food waste [48,49], while the Fuel Cell Technologies Office of the US Department of Energy estimated in 2014 a cost of 51 USD/kg H2, and it projected to drop to 5.6 USD/kg H2 by 2025 [50]. In comparison, the H2 production costs estimated in the present study were quite higher. However, it is important to note that the present estimation was conducted 1) at lab scale and 2) based only on the costs of supplies (not considering costs of raw materials, operating labor, maintenance, etc. nor any other profitability schemes such as sells of carbon dioxide and waste treatment). In any case, substantial efforts on the development and optimization of dark fermentation technology are still required since the production costs with other renewable technologies such as solar, wind and biomass gasification are in the range of 1.5–9 USD/kg [51]."
13,Conclusions,"Overall, the use of Viscozyme L as an accessory enzyme in combination with Cellulase 50 XL allowed to improve the hydrolysis yield (in terms of carbohydrates and COD) compared to the single use of Cellulase 50 XL. However, the volumetric H2 production rate values in the system fed with hydrolysates prepared with Cellulase 50 XL and Viscozyme L remained below 4.15 L H2/L-d (OLR of 70 g COD/L-d). In contrast, a maximum of 9.94 L H2/L-d (OLR of 100 g COD/L-d) was obtained with hydrolysates prepared only with Cellulase 50 XL (no accessory enzyme required). The analysis of these results and those previously reported on H2 production from enzymatic hydrolysates of agave bagasse, show that total carbohydrates concentration is not directly linked with H2 production performance, and it seems that the type of carbohydrates present in the hydrolysates is the determining factor. The use of Cellulase 50 XL lead to one of the best balances between VHPR and production costs in continuous systems with enzymatic agave bagasse hydrolysates at high OLR, reported so far. Thus, the non-lignocellulosic Cellulase 50 XL positions as a competitive option for the saccharification of lignocellulosic materials and subsequent H2 production."
