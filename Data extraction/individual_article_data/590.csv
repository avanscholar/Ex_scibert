0,Introduction,"Global warming caused by the emission of the greenhouse gas (i.e. CO2) results in multifarious and disastrous ramifications [1]. The CO2 concentration in the atmosphere increased to more than 400 ppm from 280 ppm in the past 150 years and has currently reached the highest level in the last 800,000 years [2]. Almost 100% of the CO2 emission all over the world comes from the combustion and processing of fossil-based fuels (such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas). It is estimated that approximately 4.5 × 1020 J of energy consumption worldwide per year comes from fossil fuels, which gives rise to environmental damage amounting to over $1.2 × 1012 worth of governmental expenditure [3]. Moreover, the long-term insobriety use of fossil fuel will eventually result in energy exhaustion and cause irreversible destruction on the environment. Therefore, there is a pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas discharge and other toxic pollutants. Two main advantageous strategies to minimize the atmospheric CO2 concentration are (1) conversion of CO2 into valuable carbon-based products (such as methanol, and formic acid), and (2) to the use of more sustainable and greener energy sources as alternatives to substitute fossil fuels. Sustainable energy sources such as solar [4], wind [5], and geothermal energy [6] are regarded as promising substitutions of fossil-based fuels. They can be more cost-attractive, reliable, sustainable, as well as environmentally amicable. Technology to convert solar and/or wind energy into electricity has matured and is currently extensively used in large-scale to connect to the public grids. However, these sustainable energy sources have their limitations. The supply of solar and wind powers are subjected to the weather and climate, whereas geothermal energy is confined to specific geographical regions. In these regards, hydrogen energy serves as an alternative renewable energy source that are not subjected to natural or geographical restrictions [7]. Not only is hydrogen the most abundant chemical element in the universe, the use of hydrogen energy emits zero greenhouse emissions, with water being the only by-product. Another attractive feature of hydrogen energy is high energy storage capacity. The energy that can be generated from 1 kg of hydrogen is around 120 MJ (= 33.33 kWh), which is 3 times that of conventional diesel, 4 times that of coking coal (wet basis), and 6 times that of coal (wet basis) [7a]. Therefore, hydrogen is considered an ideal energy carrier to provide a variety of opportunities for fuel cell applications in stationary energy supply, energy logistics, and hydrogen-powered mobile devices. The limitation facing the hydrogen energy development is the extremely low volumetric energy density of hydrogen. For instance, at standard temperature and pressure (STP), the volumetric energy density for gasoline is 32 MJ/L, while only 0.01 MJ/L for hydrogen [8]. This makes efficient hydrogen storage as a fuel at ambient conditions difficult to achieve. According to the setting by U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the ultimate target for the gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen on-board storage capacity is 0.065 kg H2/kg system and 0.050 kg/L, respectively [7a,7d]. To achieve this target, various methods have been developed for efficient large-scale hydrogen storage. The initial approach is characterized by physically increase hydrogen gas density via pressure or cryogenics [9]. Hydrogen gas can be stored in specialized tanks under high pressure (700 bar) and/or extremely low temperature (21 K). Due to elemental hydrogen's low ignition limits and energy, high diffusion rate in air, and low boiling point, dedicated infrastructures are therefore necessary for safe handling of hydrogen. These inevitably led to significantly increase in the overall cost of hydrogen usage [10]. Alternatively, hydrogen can also be physically adsorbed in high surface area adsorbents (such as porous nanomaterials) [11] or chemically stored into hydrides (such as metal hydrides and chemical hydrides) in the solid state [7d,12]. However, harsh storage conditions (e.g. extremely low temperatures and/or high pressures) are necessary to store hydrogen by physisorption. Furthermore, the extremely strong chemical binding in the hydride often results in sluggish kinetics and impractical hydrogen desorption temperature, thereby reducing the efficiency and suitability for practical applications. In contrast, stable hydrogen storage at ambient conditions can be achieved through the binding atomic hydrogen to hydrogen-lean molecules in liquid compounds. Some comprehensive reviews on liquid-phase chemical hydrogen storage materials have been reported [7e,7f,13,14]. Indirect hydrogen storages can be generally classified into two ways, according to the property of hydrogen-lean molecules. In the first case, the hydrogen-lean molecule is derived from the atmosphere or exhaust gas mixtures (e.g. CO2 and N2). The typical hydrogenated forms of such hydrogen-lean molecules are formic acid (HCOOH, FA) (Section 2), alcohols (Section 3), and ammonia (Section 4). The second type is termed liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) (Section 5), which undergo fully reversible hydrogenation/dehydrogenation cycles. Furthermore, the hydrogen-lean compound is typically high-boiling-point molecules. Pure H2 is thus relatively easy to be separated from the liquid molecules via condensation process. Such a hydrogen-storage approach is therefore economically and technologically attractive for implementation in actual applications. This review summarizes the scientific foundations and recent advances of chemical hydrogen storage in liquid hydrogen-rich molecules (Fig. 1 ), along with perspectives towards sustainable and economical hydrogen storage."
1,Formic acid,"As the simplest carboxylic acid, FA is a nontoxic liquid at room temperature, which is beneficial for storage, handling, and transportation [7e,7f,13]. FA can be obtained via natural biological metabolic processes as well as from the hydrogenation of CO2. FA is extensively investigated as a useful energy carrier in fuel cell applications. On one hand, it can be directly fed into a direct formic acid fuel cell (DFAFC) for electricity generation. On the other hand, FA contains relatively high hydrogen content of 4.4 wt% (53 g L−1), and can serve as a hydrogen carrier by releasing H2 through a catalytic dehydrogenation process. Moreover, in the aqueous medium, the free energy required for the formation of FA is as low as −4 kJ mol−1, which is extremely smaller than other hydrogen vectors. An ideal carbon-neutral H2 storage/release cycle comprises of the quantitative hydrogenation of CO2 to FA followed by the selective dehydrogenation of the resultant FA. To date, a diversed range of catalysts (either heterogeneous or homogeneous) with excellent catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability, have been developed for the hydrogen storage/release based on the FA/CO2 under mild condition [13,14]. Herein, we summarized the latest development of catalysts for formic acid dehydrogenation to produce H2 and its regeneration from reduction of CO2."
2,Hydrogen production from the dehydrogenation of formic acid,"2.1 Hydrogen production from the dehydrogenation of formic acid 2.1.1 Formic acid dehydrogenation with homogeneous catalysts Generally, the decomposition of FA can undergo two routes: (1) decarboxylation to produce H2 and CO2, and (2) decarboxylation to produce H2O and CO. Given the emission of CO will poison the catalysts in fuel cells, the second FA dehydrogenation pathway should be avoided. This can be achieved by tailoring the FA-decomposition pathway by appropriate regulation of reaction conditions (e.g. temperature, pressure, additives, and reactant concentration) and the choice of catalysts, The first homogeneous catalysts for FA-decomposition was reported in 1967 to be a iridium-based complex bearing a phosphine ligand (i.e. (IrH2Cl(PP3)3)), which displayed a turnover frequency (TOF) value of 1187 h−1 at an elevated temperature [15]. The emission of undesired CO by-product cannot be avoided and the deactivation of the catalyst during the FA dehydrogenation reaction became inevitable. In 2008, Beller group [16] and Laurency group [17] reported using water-soluble Ru-based complexes to catalyze the dehydrogenation of FA in the basic aqueous solution, thereby demonstrating a great practical protentional of FA in hydrogen technology. They revealed that the thermal decomposition of FA into CO and H2O was depended on the FA concentration and temperature, and become more consequential at elevated temperatures. By using a highly efficient catalyst, FA decomposed instantly at high temperatures, reducing the residence time, and therefore, avoiding the production of CO. Ever since then, tremendous efforts have been put forth to develop high-activity homogeneous catalysts for the production of H2 from formic acid under mild conditions. To date, noble metal-based (Ir-, Ru-, Pt-, and Rh-) complexes constitute some of the most promising catalysts for efficient hydrogen generation from FA [13,14a,18]. Amongst these, Cp*Ir complexes (Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)) bearing aromatic N^N-bidentate ligands (Fig. 2 ) served as the representative catalysts. Li and co-workers developed Ir-based complexes containing conjugated N,N’-diimine ligands (Fig. 2a) [18,19] which exhibited excellent catalytic activity for the decomposition of FA to H2 in base-free and additive-free aqueous conditions. The as-synthesized [Cp*Ir(L1)Cl]Cl (L1 = 2,2′-bi-2-imidazoline) complex demonstrated an impressive TOF value of 487,500 h−1 at 90 °C, which is the highest reported TOF so far. In the mechanistic study, it was revealed that the rate-determining step involved the formation of [Ir-H] intermediate species. Himeda group investigated the effects of ligands on iridium complexes on the catalyzing the production of hydrogen from FA [19]. They reported that ligands with electron-rich structures (e.g. pyrimidine, imidazole, and imidazoline) show higher catalytic activity than those with electron-deficient structure (e.g. pyridine). . Amongst the series of Cp*Ir complexes with imidazoline derivatives (Fig. 2b), the Cp*Ir complex with a bidentate pyridyl-imidazoline ligand completed FA decomposition with a fixed reaction rate even under higher FA concentration conditions, resulting in a large quantity of H2 (1.02 m3) generation in water without any organic additives [20]. More recently, a new Cp*Ir catalyst coordinated with an electron-enriched dipyridylamine ligand (Fig. 2c) was studied for the production of hydrogen from FA [21]. By leveraging the as-synthesized [IrIIICp*{(4-dimethylaminopyridin-2-yl-kN)(pyridin-2′-ylkN)amine}(OSO3)] complex, the high decomposition catalytic activity for aqueous and neat FA dehydrogenation were achieved, with the TOF of 38,236 h−1 and 13,292 h−1, respectively, at 100 °C without the presence of base. Furthermore, CO was found to be not produced in both reactions. The introduction of electron-donating substituents onto the ligands was found effective in increasing the catalytic activity for FA dehydrogenation. Highly electron-donating substituents, such as hydroxyl and amino-functional groups (Fig. 2d, e, f, and g), were found to perform much better than other substituents with methyl or methoxy moieties. A panel of Cp*Ir catalysts with 2,2′-bipyridine (bpy) ligands with amino-functionalized moieties were studied to explain the electronic effect of functionalized ligands on the catalytic performance in the FA-dehydrogenation process under base-free solution (Fig. 2f, and g) [22]. It was found that the Ir complexes containingligands with amino groups functionalized at the para-positions exhibit greater catalytic performance in FA-dehydrogenation, compared to complexes containing ligands functionalized with hydroxyl groups at the same positions or amino groups at the ortho-positions. In addition to Ir-based complexes, other hydrophilic noble metal-based (e.g. Pt-, Ru-, and Rh-) catalysts, were also widely investigated (Fig. 2h to l) [13,23,58]. However, these complexes show relatively low catalytic activities and/or the need for additional additives (e.g. amines and organic solvents). In addition to the noble metal catalysts, the development of efficient and low-cost non-precious metal-based (e.g. Ni-, Fe-, Co-, and Mn-) catalytic systems is highly demanded (Fig. 2k to n) [13,24,42a]. For instance, a cobalt catalyst (Fig. 2k) was reported for hydrogen generation from FA in a basic aqueous medium [24a]. In addition, a phosphine-free manganese complex containing biomimetic κ2-NN type ligands was found to exhibit improved catalytic activity and stability for the decomposition of FA in the presence of KOH (Fig. 2l). The Mn(pyridine-imidazoline)(CO)3Br complex was even found to be stable and active in the reaction for more than three days and able to produce an H2/CO2 gas mixture more than 14 L [24b]. Hydrogen storage can also be achieved in a system containing formate and bicarbonate salt. Fig. 3 illustrates the reversible hydrogen storage/release cycles based on the FA/CO2 (without base) and the formate/bicarbonate (with base) couples. Without the addition of bases, the hydrogenation reaction consists of the CO2 reduction with two electrons leading the FA formation. Under basic condition, FA is converted into formate conjugated base. The dehydrogenation of formate produces H2 which was channeled to hydrogenate the bicarbonate salt in the system. The handling of aqueous metal formate and bicarbonate salt is also convenient due to their benign nature and non-corrosive properties. While the addition of bases (such as DBU, NEt3, Na2CO3, and KOH) significantly promotes the reactions and makes the reaction process more controllable, their presence also decreases the overall system H2 storage density, as well as complicates the gas products during the dehydrogenation process. Therefore, an additive-free reaction condition is desired for both the FA-dehydrogenation and CO2-hydrogenation. Recently, several non-noble metal complexes were explored for the dehydrogenation of FA in additive-free solution, and were found to exhibit high catalytic activity. Pincer-supported iron complex (iPrPNMeP)Fe(H)2(CO) (iPrPNMeP = CH3N(CH2CH2PiPr2)2) (Fig. 2m) was found to achieve a high turnover number (TON) value of 100,000 for additive-free FA decomposition [25]. The outstanding catalytic performance can be ascribed to the enhanced stability of the catalyst coordinated by the iPrPNMeP ligand. 2.1.2 Formic acid dehydrogenation with heterogeneous catalysts Despite the high efficiency of homogeneous catalysts, they suffer from complicated product separation processes and non-recyclability, therefore hampering the potential applications for practical interests. Driving by this, heterogeneous catalysts gain increasing attention for hydrogen storage and generation based on FA and CO2. In heterogeneous catalysis, noble metals and their alloys nanoparticles (NPs) serve as attractive candidates to catalyze the formation and selective decomposition of FA [14b,14e,19,26]. Furthermore, their catalytic activity can be effectively improved by employing appropriate support materials, which can effectively avoid the aggregation of those metal NPs, thus offering more active sites by dispersing active metals over the nanomaterials. Nanomaterials, such as porous carbons, nanostructured silica (SiO2), and porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), possessing ultra-high surface areas, high porosity and chemical stability properties are feasible candidates for metal NPs supports [19]. Moreover, the functionalization of the nanomaterial is a promising approach to enhance the interactions between metals and support materials, facilitating the dispersity of metal NPs, therefore leading to high catalytic performance. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are attractive support materials for ultra-fine metal NPs, owning to their synthetically-tailorable surface area, pore size, and pore distribution, thus offering tunable physical and chemical properties of catalysts [26a]. A representative example was reported by Xu and co-workers [27]. Through a simple liquid impregnation method, bimetallic AuPd NPs were successfully immobilized in the MOF (MIL-101) and its amine grafted counterpart (ED-MIL-101, ED = ethylenediamine), respectively. The resultant AuPd/MIL-101 and AuPd/ED-MIL-101 composites displayed excellent catalytic activity and selectivity for FA decomposition to produce pure H2 at an moderate temperature, and with a high tolerance to CO poison. Shokouhimehr et al. prepared an ultra-small sized Pd particles via the support of Cr-MIL-101 functionalized with diamine groups (Fig. 4 ) [28]. The coordination of diamine groups on the active metal sites (Cr) promoted the improvement of the catalytic performance for the high-quality H2 generation from FA at room temperature. The as-synthesized Pd@(ethylene diamine)/Cr-MIL-101 possessed a high TOF value of 583 h−1 at temperature of 55 °C. Through a simple sequential impregnation-reduction method, CrPd NPs were successfully immobilized on NH2-functionalized porous metal-organic framework (MIL-101) [29]. Due to the strong interactions between metal and the support (MIL-101-NH2) the as-prepared Cr0.4Pd0.6/MIL-101-NH2 catalyst showed superior catalytic activity for FA decomposition with an initial TOF as high as 2009 mol H2 mol Pd−1 h−1 at 50 °C. Besides MOF, other porous nanomaterials, such as active carbon and SiO2, are also widely investigated for stabilizing metal NPs to facilitate hydrogen generation from FA dehydrogenation. Recently, Pd NPs were successfully attached to polyaniline-modified carbon (PANI-Pd/C) via interfacial microenvironment regulation technique. The resultant ultrafine 0.01-PANI-Pd/C composite exhibited a high TOF (5654 h−1) and excellent resistance to CO poisoning [30]. Xu and co-workers reported a phosphate-mediation approach to fabricate highly active metal NPs (Fig. 5 ) [31]. Au2Pd3@(P)NC catalyst was prepared by immobilizing highly active AuPd NPs on N-doped porous carbon by this approach. Highly dispersed ultrafine AuPd NPs were obtained because of the surface phosphate group of the N-doped carbon. The as-prepared Au2Pd3@(P)NC catalyst possessed superior catalytic activity for the decomposition of FA at room temperature (303 K) with a high TOF of 5400 h−1 and 100% H2 selectivity. IrPdAu/NH2-SBA-15 was fabricated through a conventional wet chemical strategy by leveraging on trimetallic alloys (IrPdAu) nanoparticles and amine-modified mesoporous SiO2 (NH2-SBA-15). The obtained IrPdAu/NH2-SBA-15 catalyst displayed high catalytic activity to dehydrogenate FA at room temperature (298 K) [32]. 100% H2 selectivity with extraordinarily high initial TOFs of 6316 h−1 and 4737 h−1 was achieved with and without the additive of sodium formate (SF), respectively. The unprecedented performance of IrPdAu/NH2-SBA-15 catalyst was ascribed to (1) the amine moiety anchored on the SBA-15, (2) the electronic synergistic effect of alloys NPs, and (3) the strong metal-support interaction. Chen et al. designed a series of PdCoNi NPs anchored on N-doped carbon nanosheets (NCN) (PdCoNi/NCN). As the introduction of pyrrolic N to CN, the size of the obtained Pd0.6Co0.2Ni0.2 NP significantly reduced to 1.60 nm, resulting in the conspicuous improvement of catalytic activity. Using PdCoNi/NCN catalyst, the conversion of FA dehydrogenation can reach up to 99%, the selectivity of H2 was reached 100%, and a high TOF was recorded of 1249.0 h−1 at room temperature [33]. Likewise, Cai and co-workers incorporated adatom-doped approach in the design of C-supported Pd NPs to accelerate the hydrogen generation from FA [34]. Kinetic studies and DFT calculation revealed that the ability of H, CO, and formate intermediate (HCOO−) to attach to the catalyst can be tailored via the incorporation of adatoms (such as Bi). With the Pd@Bi/C catalyst, faster H2 production with a TOF of 4350 h−1 under mild conditions (303 K) in a mixture of FA and sodium formate solution can be achieved."
3,Hydrogen storage via the regeneration of formic acid,"2.2 Hydrogen storage via the regeneration of formic acid 2.2.1 Formic acid regeneration with homogeneous catalysts While the by-product CO2 generated from FA dehydrogenation can be captured and reconvert to FA by a reaction with H2the process of recycling CO2 needs to overcome high energy barrier due to the thermodynamical stability of the molecule [13]. This may be overcome by the use of a catalyst. A library of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts have been developed to catalyze the reduction CO2 to regenerate FA, which has been well-discussed in several recent reviews [13,14b,35]. Metal complexes with highly electron-donating ligands tend to exhibit higher catalytic activity for the CO2 hydrogenation to FA-formation. Water soluble noble metal (such as Ru-, and Ir-) complex and non-noble metal (such as Fe-, Ni-, and Co-) complexes bearing electro-rich ligands are widely explored for CO2 fixation (Table 1 ). By the introduction of hydroxy groups and electron-rich diazole rings possessing an uncoordinated NH moiety to the bidentate ligands, the catalytic performance of the Cp*Ir complexes was significantly improved (a TOF of 2000 h−1) compared to the bipyridine ligand [36]. UV–vis spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that electronic properties of Ir-based complexes was altered by the reversible deprotonation of the OH and NH groups on ligand's pyridineand diazole rings, which increases the electron donating ability, resulting in the high catalytic activity of the designed Ir complexes. Li and co-workers developed a highly efficient iridium catalyst bearing a NˏN´-diimine ligand [Cp*Ir(NˏN´)Cl]Cl (NˏN´ = 2ˏ2´-bi-1ˏ4ˏ5ˏ6-tetrahydropyrimidine) to directly convert CO2 to FA in base-free aqueous solution [37]. An initial TOF of over 13 000 h−1 and a TON of over 10 000 were achieved under mild reaction condition. The catalytic CO2 reduction to FA cycle consists of the following steps: (1) a hydride intermediate was formed by the heterolytic H2 cleavage and (2) CO2 inserted into the Ir-H bond. According to the findings from kinetic and NMR studies, the CO2 insertion step is the rate-limiting step. Besides, the kinetics of the catalytic cycle was also influenced by the dissociation of the coordinated water from the Ir-based catalyst. Leitner and colleagues developed a novel Ru complex [Ru(Acriphos)(PPh3)(Cl)(PhCO2)] [Acriphos = 4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)acridine] for the catalytic synthesis of FA in DMSO and DMSO/H2O without the use of any amines [38]. The Ru catalyst displayed excellent activity in the base-free CO2 hydrogenation catalytic process with a TON value approaching 4200 and TOF up to 260 h−1. Computational calculations demonstrated that the hydrogen bonding between FA and reaction medium contributed to the thermodynamic stabilization of FA. Fe(II) hydrido carbonyl complexes with coordinated PNP (PNP = 2,6-bis(di‑tert-butylphosphinomethyl)pyridine pincer ligands were applied to boost the catalytic formation of formate from CO2 under mild conditions (8.5 bar and 25 °C). In the presence of a base, quantitative FA yields and high TONs were achieved through the use of the iron catalyst [39]. Recently, Renaud and co-workers prepared a new stable phosphine-free iron catalyst system to promote the reduction of CO2 in pure water in the presence of base. The reported diaminocyclopentadienone Fe tricarbonyl complexes exhibited the highest TON of 3540 amongst the other iron catalysts without any air-sensitive ligands [40]. A series of water-soluble nickel-azatrane complexes were also explored for the hydrogenation of bicarbonate to formate in H2O, which was reported to achieve an outstanding TON of 121 at 120 °C and 60 bar. The incorporation of isopropyl and methyl groups on the ligands was reportedly crucial for efficiently improving the formate conversion [41]. Multiphasic reaction system has gained considerable research attention in the formic acid formation from carbon dioxide. Recently, a base-free DMSO-mediated homogeneous catalyzed CO2 hydrogenation system was reported [46], whereby the application of a multiphasic approach (n-heptane/DMSO) facilitated the successful immobilizing of the catalyst in the n-heptane phase and promoted the facile product separation in the catalyst-free DMSO phase according to the strong DMSO-FA molecular interactions. Furthermore, acetic acid was considered as an ideal co-solvent to distill pure FA. The application of biphasic reaction approach facilitated the separation of catalysts, boosted the reaction rate, and promoted the product purification process. Kothandaraman et al. presented a green and direct approach of CO2 capture by amines in aqueous solution and storage in the form of ammonium formate [47]. In this system, the dual functional amines served as the catcher of CO2 as well as the stabilizer of the formate product. The CO2 conversion reached 95% through the use of Ru-PNP and Fe-PNP pincer complexes at moderate conditions (50 bar H2 at 55 °C). The catalyst recyclability experiment was carried out in a H2O/Me-THF biphasic solvent system, in which the catalyst can be recycled for 5 cycles with a TON > 7000 for the overall approach. An aqueous biphasic catalytic system was demonstrated to synthesize formate solutions directly from amine solution using cis-[Ru(dppm)2Cl2] (dppm = bis-diphenylphosphinomethane) catalyst. In this system, the catalyst immobilized in the organic stationary phase, while the formate-amine product quantitatively extracted in the aqueous phase as amines tended to partition between the two phases according to the polarities (Fig. 6 ) [48]. The highest single batch activity was achieved in presence of NEt3 with TOFav of 35,000 h−1 and an initial TOF of 180,000 h−1 in the solvent pair of methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC) and H2O . 2.2.2 Formic acid regeneration with heterogeneous catalysts Apart from homogeneous catalysts, heterogeneous catalysts are also extensively used in the reduction of CO2 to FA, and they exhibit high catalytic activity and good recyclability. For example, through a simple linkage of the cyclopentadienone iron tricarbonyl complex with the Cr dicarboxylate MOF MIL-53(Cr), the obtained heterogeneous FA generation catalyst showed a TON up to 3006, which was the highest TON value among reported phosphine-free iron catalysts thus far [49]. A series of ruthenium-based catalysts Ru-NHC-MOF were successfully prepared by post-synthetic metalation via immobilizing Ru complexes on an azolium based MOF [50]. The as-prepared Ru3 NHC-MOF catalyst displayed the highest activity due to the stronger electron-donating ability of C6Me6 ligand (C6Me6 = hexamethylbenzene) in [Ru (C6Me6)Cl2]2 complex. A TON up to 3803 was recorded at 120 °C in DMF with K2CO3 added as additive under a total pressure of 8 MPa (H2/CO2=1) for 2 h. In addition, the Ru3 NHC-MOF catalyst can be effectively recovered from reaction mixture through simple filtration without significant loss of catalytic activity. Ru (III) catalyst prepared through immobilization of RuCl3•xH2O onto a melamine polymer-network (MPN) showed catalytic activities for hydrogenation of CO2 to FA [51]. The nitrogen-rich MPN network would stabilize the Ru species through formation of stable complexes. In the presence of triethylamine, the catalyst could produce formate with a concentration of 0.42 mol L−1 with an initial TOF of 4964 h−1. In addition, ionic liquid (e.g., 1‑butyl‑3-methylimidazolium acetate [Bmim][OAc]) was investigated for the CO2 hydrogenation to FA over Pd/C NPs under mild conditions (40 °C) [52]. [Bmim][OAc] promoted the catalytic process accessible in base-free conditions, in which it played multiple roles, including CO2 activation, Pd nanoparticle modification, as well as FA stabilization. This Pd/C-[Bmim][OAc] catalytic system displayed high efficiency for FA formation with a reaction rate of 233.5 mmol g−1 h−1 and TON of 594. The covalent triazine frameworks (CTF) is a promising solid supporting material as they possess ultrahigh surface areas and high densities of quasi-bipyridine moieties, thus offering a desired coordination environment for molecular catalysts [14b,53,54], Owing to the strong binding capability between CTF and metal centers, the obtained catalyst possesses high thermal and chemical stability even under harsh supercritical and flow conditions. Yoon et al. developed a heterogeneous Ir-based catalyst by coordinating with the {IrCp*} unit onto a highly porous CTF, bpy-CTF-[IrCp*Cl]Cl [53a]. The hydrogenation of CO2 can be catalyzed with an initial TOF of 5300 h−1 and TON of 5000 after 2 h. In addition, the designed heterogenized exhibited excellent stability in air. Unfortunately, the efficiency of the catalyst was decreased over consecutive runs (∼10% in each cycles). To improve on the recyclability, oxyanionic ligands were introduced in the coordination sphere to afford a route to assist the heterolysis of H2 while avoiding of the deleterious interactions [53b]. Moreover, a higher activity metal (Ru) was used to replace Ir. The tailored heterogenized Ru-based catalyst, [bpy-CTF-Ru(acac)2]Cl, displayed excellent recyclability over consecutive operation (TOF = 22 700 h−1), and produced formate with a concentration of 1.8 M in 3 h. Due to its excellent air stability and outstanding catalytic activity, a [bpy-CTF-RuCl3] complex was investigated for the large extent FA/formate production [53c]. By coupling commercially available RuCl3•xH2O with a bipyridine-functionalized CTF, the as-prepared Ru complex displayed good selectivity and an unprecedented TOF value of 38,800 h−1(Fig. 7 ). The obtained Ru-based complex exhibited superior stability during the successive operation and yielded the final formate with a concentration of about 2.1 M within 2.5 h. More recently, the same group used a trickle-bed reactor system for continuous synthesis of FA [53d]. Using a fixed bed reactor, the as-prepared Ru/bpyTN-30-CTF catalyst showed substantial catalytic efficiency with the highest formate productivity of 669.0 gform Gcat −1 d−1 and CO2 conversion yield as 44.8% for a superficial gas velocity of 72 cm s−1. Moreover, in the successive CO2 hydrogenation process, the Ru catalyst kept the catalytic stability for continuous operation over 30 days, obtaining a total TON of 524 000 without significant deactivation."
4,Interconversion of H2/CO2 and HCOOH via bifunctional catalysts,"2.3 Interconversion of H2/CO2 and HCOOH via bifunctional catalysts The reduction of CO2 and decomposition of HCOOH for hydrogen storage discussed in the earlier sections often occur in separate steps involving two or more different catalysts. This complicates the carbon-neutral H2 storage/release cycle process and increasing the overall cost. The exploring new catalysts with robust stability, high activities, and fast kinetics for the interconversion of H2/CO2 and HCOOH in a continuous and reproducible manner is thus desired for economically viable hydrogen technology. Herein, the reversible hydrogen storage based on formic acid using one single catalyst in the same reaction medium will be discussed. Fujita group designed a novel dinuclear Cp*Ir complex ([2(OH2)2 ]4+) possessing a proton-responsive ligand (4,4ˊ,6,6ˊ-tetrahydroxy-2,2ˊ-bipyrimidine) for the pH-switchable H2 storage based on FA (Fig. 8 ) [55]. Due to the presence of pH-sensitive -OH moieties on the ligand, [2(OH2)2 ]4+ can be reversibly converted into [2ˊ(OH2)2 ] through the control of pH value, resulting in the alteration of the catalytic activity. Under basic condition, [2ˊ(OH2)2 ] boosted the CO2 hydrogenation with reaction rates as fast as 70 h−1 and 53,800 h−1 at 25 °C and 0.1 MPa, and at 80 °C and 5 MPa, respectively. Under low pH conditions, [2(OH2)2 ]4+promoted the generation of CO-free hydrogen from FA-dehydrogenation with TOF of 228,000 h−1 and TON of 308,000. The water-soluble and pH-sensitive catalyst was thus able to drive the interconversion of H2/CO2 and HCOOH by controlling the solution pH. Himeda's group reported a pH-modulatable imidazoline-based iridium complexes with two hydroxyl groups on the ortho and para positions of one coordinating pyridine ring, which displayed the best catalytic performance in the hydrogenation of CO2 (TOF = 106 h−1) in basic water. Meanwhile, the CO-free H2 production from FA (TOF = 56,900 h−1 at 60 °C) was successfully conducted in an organic solvent/additive-free aqueous solution [56]. A novel Cp*Ir-catalyst bearing OH-modified pyridyl-pyrazole was developed by Onishi et al. [57] which was found to exhibit a high catalytic activity in the fixation of CO2 as well as excellent robustness in the decomposition of FA with a TON as high as 10 million. Two hydrophilic bis-N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes of Ru and Ir were reported by Jantke et al. to exhibit high catalytic activity in both H2 generation from FA and hydrogenation of bicarbonate to formate [58]. With the application of Ru-based complex, the improved catalytic performance was obtained with TOF of 39,000 h−1 and TON of 449,000 for H2 generation at 100 °C in acid aqueous solution (pH = 2). In bicarbonate reduction, high catalytic activity was achieved even without additionally additivities. While these pH-dependent catalysts exhibited excellent activity in reversible hydrogen storage using FA, it would be interesting to develop new catalysts triggered by other stimuli, such as light and temperature. Besides, to further reduce the cost for practical applications, reducing the loading of noble metal catalyst or developing non-noble metal catalysts should be worked towards."
5,Alcohols,"In addition to formic acid, alcohol is another promising candidate for hydrogen storage. Methanol is cost-attractive and commercially available, exists in liquid state at room temperature, exhibits good solubility in water, easy to handle and transport. It is also one of the most important building blocks to produce valuable chemicals [13,59]. Be analogous to FA, methanol can be used as the liquid fuel in fuel cell (i.e. direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) and polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC)) thus rendering it a promising energy carrier employed in portable power applications. Moreover, the high hydrogen content (12.6 wt%, 99 g/L) and good heating value (638 kJ/mole) of methanol makes it a promising hydrogen vector. A carbon-neutral hydrogen storage/release cycle based on methanol consists of the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol and subsequently, the regeneration of methanol to yield H2 (Fig. 9 a)."
6,Hydrogen storage via methanol formation,"3.1 Hydrogen storage via methanol formation 3.1.1 Methanol formation with homogeneous catalysts Due to the kinetic and thermodynamic stability of CO2, the direct capture and conversion of CO2 into MeOH is challenging. In 2015, Sanford's group reported a novel MeOH synthesis approach from tandem amine and Ru-catalyzed CO2 reduction to form methanol [60]. In this system, the dimethylamine could not only directly react with CO2 to generate dimethylammonium dimethylcarbamate, but also intercept the intermediate FA to produce dimethylformamide. With the assistant of amine, high MeOH production (> 95%) was obtained at mild conditions. This amine-assisted CO2-to-MeOH system opens up the possibility for the integration of CO2 capture and conversion into methanol. Typically, the amine-assisted CO2-to-MeOH system contains two steps (Fig. 9b) [61]. In the first step, formylated amine is formed in situ via the reaction between CO2 and amine with the consumption of 1 equivalent of H2. In the subsequent step, the resulted formamide is further hydrogenated with 2 more equivalent of H2 to synthesize CH3OH, along with the regeneration of the amine. Recently, Prakash group developed several Ru pincer complexes [RuHClPNP R (CO)] (R = Ph/i-Pr/Cy/t-Bu) to explore the effects of molecular structure on the MeOH yield with the assistance of amines [61]. Amongst these, the Ru-Macho (R = Ph) complex demonstrated the highest efficiency in MeOH production in the one-pot-reaction in the presence of diamines or polyamines. Besides, the choice of ligands was also found to significantly influence catalytic activities. Taking the Ru-Macho complex for an example, the bis-carbonyl species could be re-generated to the active species through CO dissociation in the reaction, thus able to catalyze the hydrogenation of in-situ formed formamides to MeOH. The Ru-Macho-BH catalyst was established to exhibit the highest efficiency for the conversion process and still remain active after 10 days of reaction, with TOF of 9900. A low-pressure CO2 capture method with aminoethanols was demonstrated by Milstein et al. for CO2 capture and the subsequent MeOH formation [62]. By using (2-methylamino)ethanol or valinol, CO2 can be captured in the presence of Cs2CO3 at low-pressure (1–3 bar) to generate the intermediate oxazolidinones (Fig. 10 a). High MeOH production (92% - 100%) was achieved via the hydrogenation of oxazolidinones by PNN Ru catalysts, along with the regeneration of aminoethanol. Polymeric amines were also reportedly employed to assist the CO2-to-MeOH conversion [63]. A homogeneous catalyst system with pentaethylenehexamine and Ru-Macho-BH was reported for the catalytic conversion of CO2 to CH3OH at 125–165 °C, achieving a TOF of 70 h−1 at 145 °C [63b]. It was interesting that the produced CH3OH could be easily separated from the reaction mixture by distillation, and the catalyst can be reused for five cycles with high activity (TON > 2000). Fig. 10b showed the proposed reaction sequence for CO2 capture and in situ hydrogenation to MeOH using a polyamine. Most importantly, CO2 captured from air would be directly converted to MeOH by the system with yield of 79%. Apart from the amine-assisted conversion of CO2 to MeOH, alternatives such as using the CO2 derivatives (such as carbonate, formate, and formic acid) to synthesize methanol are widely studied as well [65]. For instance, FA disproportionation to MeOH was demonstrated by Ir complexes in D2O with a yield as high as 75%. In the absence of H2, FA could serve as a hydrogen donor to produce MeOH in a single reaction with concentration of 1.84 M at 50 °C. Higher MeOH concentration can be achieved through incorporation of H2 under aerobic condition, in which the highest concentrations of MeOH can be achieved up to 9.8 m with TON of 1260 [65a]. The catalytic activity of non-noble metal complex for methanol generation from CO2 hydrogenation is much lower than that of the noble metal catalyst [64]. Beller's group developed a homogeneous cobalt complex to hydrogenate CO2 at a low temperature (100 °C) [64a]. While this was the first homogeneous non-noble metal complex for the capture of CO2 and conversion into MeOH, a relatively low TON was reported. An iron pincer complex was explored for the catalytic generation of MeOH from CO2 an H2 with a TON of 590 [64b]. By coupling CO2 with H2 and amine, a formamide was formed, which underwent catalytic deaminative hydrogenation to produce MeOH. A cobalt-catalyst for the reduction of CO2 to MeOH was developed by replacing the ligand in Co(acac)2 and Co(NTf2)2 with modified triphos ligands [64c]. Though a relatively low TON (125) was obtained, the catalyst remain active below 100 °C. The effects of the catalyst structures and amines were studied to optimize the production of MeOH. Recently, a manganese pincer complex was explored to hydrogenate both carbamates and urea derivatives to MeOH, accompanying the generation of amine and alcohol [65c]. By utilization of the Mn-based complex, a quantitative conversion of the carbamate could be achieved even at lower H2 pressure (20 bar), of which 91% methanol yield was obtained. For the hydrogenation of urea derivatives, in the presence of KOtBu (4 mol%) under H2 (20 bar) at 130 °C for 48 h in THF, more than 70% MeOH yield was achieved as well. It was revealed that linear urea derivatives with aromatic substituents gave higher yields of MeOH than those bearing aliphatic substituents. This methodology might present an attractive approach for methanol generation by hydrogenation of CO2 derivatives using an earth-abundant metal catalyst. Additionally, a series of organic carbonates were catalytically reduced to produce MeOH and alcohols in the presence of a molecularly-defined homogeneous cobalt catalyst [65d]. The combination of Co(BF4)2•6H2O bearing a triphos-derived ligand displayed the high catalytic activity for the reduction of both cyclic and acyclic carbonates. Optimal results were obtained at relatively mild conditions (120 °C, 50 bar H2 pressure) with Co(BF4)2-L4 -based catalytic system. For example, both of ethyl formate and paraformaldehyde could be completely hydrogenated to produce MeOH with yield of 86% and 88%, respectively, and ethanol in more than 99%. 3.1.2 Methanol formation with heterogeneous catalysts In the development of high-performance heterogeneous catalysts for the CO2 conversion to generate methanol, many studies have been reported [14b,65b,66,67]. Song and co-workers reported the influence factor of improving the catalytic activity of Pd-based nanocatalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol formation [66a]. Exploiting mesoporous silica supports (i.e. MCM-41 and SBA-15), generating the uniform dispersion Pd NPs, which were promoted by the alkaline additives. They revealed that the small mesopores of MCM-41 and SBA-15 served as a template for the formation of ultrafine Pd NPs, leading to the higher activities for the production of methanol. Later on, the same group developed bimetallic Pd–Cu catalysts for selective CO2 hydrogenation to methanol [66b]. Due to the strong synergistic effect, the prepared amorphous silica-supported Pd–Cu bimetallic catalysts showed high efficiency in the methanol formation reaction. Furthermore, a similar bimetallic promotion effect was also observed for Pd-Cu catalysts supported on other precursors, such as uniform mesoporous MCM-41, SBA-15 and MSU-F. Geng and co-workers reported CO2 hydrogenation to methanol over Pd/ZnO/Al2O3 [66c]. The catalytic performance could be tuned by the reaction condition, preparation method, and the loading ratio of Pd NPs. They disclosed that the methanol selectivity depended on the content of PdZn alloy, which could be synthetically changed. Apart from the Pd-based catalysts, other metal catalysts are also widely studied for methanol generation from CO2 [14b,65b,77]. Hutchings and colleagues used stable amorphous georgeite as a precursor to prepare high-performance catalysts. Through the supercritical anti-solvent precipitation, the obtained precursor with low amounts of Na and defined structure. After the calcination, a complex mixture of CuO and abnormally small disordered ZnO was obtained, in which, notable interactions between Cu and ZnO was observed after reduction. Recently, a periodic mesoporous organosilica (PMO) was prepared as a precursor to load Ir-based complex on the pore surface. The as-prepared heterogeneous Ir-PMO catalyst exhibited superior FA conversion and methanol selectivity with respect to traditional homogeneous Ir-based complex (Fig. 11 ). The improvement of the MeOH selectivity of the Ir-PMO complex would be associated with the confinement effect in the meso‑channels with their high aspect ratios for the retention of generated H2/CO2 mixture, which suppressed the competing processes involving FA decomposition and promoted formic acid hydrogenation. To date, significant achievements have been attained for hydrogen storage/release based on methanol/CO2 couple, such as the decomposition of methanol under considerably mild conditions with even non-noble metal-based catalysts and full conversion can be made under basic condition with proper operation. Strategies, involving (1) the implementation of CO2 or its derivatives into cascade catalysis hydrogenation, (2) the intelligent combination of biocatalysts and metal complexes to reduce the reaction temperature, (3) the utilization of photochemistry in the hydrogen evolution reaction, and (4) the employment of additives to promote H2 storage and release, are common in the hydrogen generation/release cycle based on the alcohols/carbon dioxide couple. Besides, new concepts to further improve the reaction efficiency are thriving. For example, (1) directly fulfill the hydrogen storage and generation with amine-additives; (2) the release hydrogen along with the production of valuable products; and (3) making use of biomass or other renewable materials as raw materials."
7,Hydrogen production from methanol dehydrogenation,"3.2 Hydrogen production from methanol dehydrogenation 3.2.1 Methanol dehydrogenation with homogeneous catalysts As we known, the generation of H2 from methanol dehydrogenation is an endothermic process, typically, performed with heterogeneous catalysts under harsh reaction conditions such as high temperature (200–300 °C) and high pressure (25–50 bar) [13,59a,59b]. With the development of hydrogen technology, low-temperature hydrogen production from methanol dehydrogenation can be achievable in present days, though restrictions, such as requiring basic additives and expensive noble metal complexes still exist. Therefore, the quest for novel economical high-performance catalysts and reaction systems for hydrogen production from methanol dehydrogenation is highly urgent. Up to now, numerous efforts have been devoted to developing highly efficient catalysts systems [68]. The production of H2 and CO2 via methanol decomposition can be dated back to the 1980s through the use of Ru-based complexes at a high temperature (over 200 °C). Mechanistic investigations revealed that the incorporation of bulky and electron-withdraw ligands were able to enhance the catalytic activity significantly. Belller‘s group presented an efficient methanol reforming approach to produce H2 in aqueous medium at low temperature (65–95 °C) and ambient pressure (Fig. 12 ) [68a]. By using the Ru PNP complex, [RuHCl(CO)(HN(C2H4PiPr2)2)] (iPr = CH(CH3)2), a unprecedented TOF value of 4700 h−1 and TON over 350,000 can be achieved. Notably, all available hydrogen atoms in CH3OHH2O system (including the hydrogen in water) were effectively converted into H2. The Ru PNP complexes has been benchmarked as the representive catalysts for the low-temperature (below 100 °C) hydrogen generation from methanol-reforming in the methanol-water system [68b,68c]. A ruthenium complex bearing a chelating bis(olefin) diazadiene ligand (trop2dad) was investigated by Rodríguez-Lugo et al. [68d] The catalytic performance of the obtained Ru complex [K(dme)2][Ru(H)(trop2dad)] was evaluated for the production of hydrogen in the methanol-water mixture. During the catalytic cycle, the Ru-based complex possessed a co-operative trop2dad ligand, which acted as molecular electrocatalyst for the conversion of methanol to hydrogen. The coordination of electronically and chemically ‘non-innocent’ co-operative ligands to the metal complex served as an efficient strategy for the dehydrogenation of methanol to CO2 and H2. Milsterin‘s group explored an analogous Ru-PNN pincer complex to regenerate methanol under low-temperature with H2 yield of up to 82% [68e]. Interestingly, the Ru-based catalyst was reusable and the catalytic activity lasting for around 30 days without attenuating. An anionic bipyriddonate-iridium-based catalyst was reported by Yamaguchi and coworkers for the hydrogen production in a methanol-water system [68f]. Hydrogen was generated from the methanol-water system at temperature below 100 °C without any addition of organic solvent. Recently, a bicatalytic system (Ru-based complexes) was developed in the reforming of aqueous methanol to boost the hydrogen production [69b]. The reaction process was reported to contain multiple steps, and thus the approach is to use of more than one catalyst to enhance the catalytic efficacy. In addition to the expensive noble metal catalysts, lower-cost non-noble metal such as iron and manganese were also reported to exhibit high catalytic performance for the menthanol regeneration [13,69]. A pincer-supported non-precious iron complex was developed to catalyze the methanol dehydrogenation in a base-free methanol-water mixture with a TON up to 51,000 [69a]. To promote the decarboxylation of the intermediate Fe formate, a trace amount of Lewis acid was added. The PNP ligand in the Fe catalyst which possesses bifunctional reactivity, played a crucial role in the reaction. Besides, Mn complex (Mn-PNPiPr) also showed excellent long-term stability for the generation of hydrogen in the methanol-water system with a TON over 20,000 TON [69b]. Chemo-enzymatic hydrogen production from methanol is emerging as an interesting strategy for methanol dehydrogenation at low temperature [70]. Prechtl‘s group reported the use of linkage of the enzymatic and Ru-based catalysis for methanol reforming at room temperature. To overcome the high-temperature constrains faced by purely metal-based catalysis system, a suitable intergration between the biocatalysts and metal complexes could be employed. With the assistance of dehydeogenases, methanol was completely converted into hydrogen and carbon dioxide at 30 °C in weak basic media [70c]. Fig. 13 describes this strategy that involves two processes: (1) CH3OH→HCOOH→H2 and (2) CH3OH→NADH→H2, where NADH is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Through the use of alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, FA and NADH were obtained simultaneously. Using the Ir catalyst (Cp*IrCl2(ppy), ppy = polypyrrole), FA was converted into hydrogen with a speed of 17.8 μmol h−1 gcat −1. At the same time, an enzyme mimic was applied to convert DADH to H2. Besides, Zhou and co-workers applied the chemoenzymatic hydrogen production approach to continually synthesize hydrogen from methanol for around 32 h at near-room temperature [70d]. Apart from the use of thermal dehydrogenation catalysts for the dehydroganation of methanol, photochemical anhydrous methanol dehydrogenation was also investigated for the low-temperature hydrogen generation from methanol [77]. Furthermore, the intermediates (anhydrous formaldehyde) obtained in the light-induced reaction can be a useful chemical feedstock for the synthesis of other value-added chemicals. An Fe- complex containing o-phenylenediamine (opda) ligand was investigated for the photochemical hydrogen evolution reaction at room temperature [77a]. In the catalytic cycle, the hydroquinone ligand in the tris(o-phenylenediamine) iron(II) complex [FeII(opda)3](ClO4)2 acted as H+/e− donor, to facilitate the metal-ligand interaction. Chang and co-workers reported the photo-induced hydrogen evolution reaction from anhydrous methanol at room temperature using photocatalysts, including o-aminophenol (apH2), o-aminophenolate (apH−), and the non-noble Fe complex trans-[FeII(apH)2(MeOH)2] [77b]. According to mechanistic study, the hydrogen radical generated behaved as a trigger for the photochemical hydrogen evolution reaction. The products (hydrogen and formaldehyde) can be generated under excitation at 289 ± 10 nm even without the use of photosensitizers. Very recently, a metal-free photocatalysis was investigated with cyano-carboxylic bifunctionally-modified polymeric carbon nitride [77c]. In the catalytic process, the cyano group was related to the catalyst photoelectric performance, while the carboxyl groups was active to boost the hydrogen generation from methanol. 3.2.2 Methanol dehydrogenation with heterogeneous catalysts Hydrogen production from methanol steam reforming (MSR, Eq. (3.1)) is considered as an efficient approach in the future clean energy infrastructure for fuel-cell applications. Because catalysts used in fuel cells (i.e. PEMFCs) are extremely sensitive to CO and easy to get poison to cause performance degradation, one of the purposes of the MSR process is to decrease the CO amount as much as possible. (3.1) CH3OH + H2O→CO2 + 3H2 Up to now, there are two main classes of heterogeneous catalysts, i.e. Cu-based and Pd-based catalysts, which showed high catalytic activity for hydrogen generation in MSR reaction. Among which, Cu-based catalysts (such as Cu/Zn/Al2O3, and Cu/ZnO/Al2O3) are generally low cost and demonstrate high catalytic activity and good CO2 selectivity. However, they are prone to sinter and gradually deteriorate at an elevated temperature. For example, the most commonly used copper-based catalyst, i.e. CuO/ZnO, displayed good activity only at a temperature below 250 °C; the catalytic activity of Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 dropped 40% after 60 h on stream. Whereas the MSR reaction is a strong endothermic process, a high temperature is favorable for the reaction, making the copper-based catalyst difficult to be widely utilized. To improve the catalytic activity, anti-deactivation ability, and stability performance of copper-based catalysts at higher temperatures, different methods have been attempted. Kniep et al. revealed the relationships between the catalytic activity of copper catalysts and surface/bulk structure. They noted that the structure of the catalyst influenced the catalytic activity more than variations in the chemical composition, while the structural characteristics of copper-based catalysts can be tuned directly during the preparation process [72]. A Cu/ZnO catalyst promoted by Sc2O3 was revealed by Pu et al., by which, the hydrogen production rate from MSR reaction at temperatures higher than 260 °C was increased by three times. They demonstrated that the Sc3+ ion was adequately mixed with ZnO lattice, leading to the strength interaction between Cu metal and support oxide, and subsequently enhanced catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst in the MSR process [73]. Pan et al. [74a] and Zhou et al. [74b] added Zr to improve the reducibility of copper and achieve higher metal surface area to improve the catalytic performance in MSR. Own to its unique structure and ability to participate in the MSR reaction, the metal-organic framework material, such as Cu-BTC, is regarded as a useful dual-functional supporting material for hydrogen production in the MSR. Recently, Yu and co-workers loaded CuO/ZnO on different masses of Cu-BTC to improve the catalytic activity, anti-deactivation ability, and stability performance in the MSR reaction. Comparing to the CuO/ZnO catalyst, CuO/ZnO/Cu-BTCs with 0.5 and 1 g Cu-BTC exhibited an enormously faster hydrogen generation rate at 300 °C. Furthermore, two MOF-modified copper-based composites with unique stings structures on the surface of the reacted particles delayed the deterioration temperature to 320 °C, which is higher than the unmodified CuO/ZnO catalyst with a deactivation temperature at 280 °C [75]. The Pd-based catalyst is one of the most active species for catalyzing the methanol steam reforming reaction [76]. Through supporting the Pd NPs on ZnO and reduced at temperatures above 300 °C, the obtained Pd/ZnO catalysts exhibited high activity and anomalously high CO2 selectivity. Moreover, Armbrüster and colleagues revealed the reason why the ZnO-supported PdZn catalysts showed high CO2 selectivity in MSR by a combination of catalytic studies and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. They discovered that the water activation ability of the catalyst had been improved dramatically by partially oxidating the PdZn NPs, resulting in high CO2 selectivity [76b]. Bonivardi and co-workers found that the MSR reaction only occur in the presence of support material ZnO using Pd-based catalysts (i.e. Pd/ZnO and Pd/ZnO/CeO2) and the reaction was considerably affected by the kind of support materials [76c]. Recently, Guo and coworkers prepared a zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) as the precursor to support Pd/ZnO alloy catalyst to obtain uniformly dispersion and stability of Pd nano-catalysts. After reducing at 300 °C for 2 h, the Pd/ZnO catalyst displayed excellent catalyst performance, with a methanol conversion of 97–98% and the CO2 selectivity is up to 86.3%. Also, the prepared catalyst showed good stability after a 50 h time-on-stream test [76d]. Since the pure Pd NPs are not consistently dispersed and easy to agglomerate during the reaction, resulting in a negative change in catalytic activity. Furthermore, the hole construction at the supporting material surface facilitates the transportation of substrates/products and guarantees the accessibility of active sites. Consequently, a high-surface-area supporting material is a key factor to prepare a high-performance catalyst."
8,Hydrogen production based on other alcohols dehydrogenation,"3.3 Hydrogen production based on other alcohols dehydrogenation Apart from MeOH, other alcohol substrates, such as C2 alcohols (ethanol, ethylene glycol, 2-aminoethanol, n-propanol, and isopropanol), C3 alcohols (glycerol, and n-butanol), C4 alcohols (1,4-butanediol), and C5&C6 alcohols (fructose, glucose, and cellulose) are also regarded as promising potential liquid hydrogen vectors [77,78,79,80]. The capture of CO2 and subsequent conversion to higher alcohols commonly occurs in nature, such as the photosynthesis of glucose. However, differing from MeOH and FA, a closed hydrogen storage cycle involves the reversibly conversion between CO2 and higher alcohols current are not feasible. Herein, the latest developments of hydrogen generation from the dehydrogenation of higher alcohols will be introduced. Ethanol (EtOH) is one most promising candidates for hydrogen storage, due to its high hydrogen content (13.13 wt%) and ease of synthesis from biomass. Industrial bio-EtOH aqueous solution (5% H2O) was reported to produce H2 by the catalytic reaction with pincer-type transition metal catalysts [Ru(H)(Cl)(CO)( i Pr2PEtN(H)EtP i Pr2)] complex with an optimal conversion of 70% . A initial TOF of 1770 h−1 and TON of 80,000 after four days were reported in the presence of base (8 M NaOH, 90 °C) [77a]. The produced H2 can then be directly utilized in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, where extremely low CO are recorded. The experiment demonstrated a protocol to use industrial bio-EtOH without H2O removal for H2 generation. Han and coworkers developed a monometallic Ru3(CO)12 complex to boost the synthesis of ethanol from CO2 in the ionic liquid [77b]. The formation of ethanol was operated at temperature of 120 °C, which was the lowest temperature recorded so far. They revealed that the employment of ionic liquid (i.e. 1‑butyl‑3-methylimidazolium chloride ([bmim]Cl)) effectively enhanced the catalytic activity with the TON of 180 after five cycles. Ehylene glycol (EG) is another important C2 diol, and widely used in chemical industry due to its abundant production and non-toxicity [78]. Recently, an efficient liquid hydrogen storage system based on EG and EtOH was developed, in which the dehydrogenative esterification and reverse hydrogenation under low H2 pressure (5 bar) could efficiently catalyzed by ruthenium pincer complexes [78a]. The EG-EtOH couple exhibited a relatively high theoretical gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity (HSC > 5.0 wt%), thus providing potential value for application in hydrogen storage and portable energy systems. Another convenient and reversible hydrogen storage system based on EG was developed with theoretically HSC of 6.5 wt%, in which hydrogen can be efficiently loaded and discharged by using the same ruthenium pincer complex under similar reaction conditions [78b]. The common challenges related to usage of EG for hydrogen storage was overcame by the special characteristics of the acridine ligand-backbone. Those findings can help to push forward the development of LOHC as energy vectors for large scale applications, such as energy storage and transportation. The first dehydrogenation of isopropanol (hydrogen capacity = 13.42 wt%) was reported in 1960, in which rhodium chloride and Rh-Sn complexes could convert isopropanol to acetone. Recently, a highly-performing catalyst for the dehydrogenation of isopropanol was developed using an in-situ system fabricated from a ruthenium precursor [RuH2(PPh3)3CO] and an equimolar amount of the aliphatic ligand HPNP i Pr [79a]. The catalytic system showed a high catalytic activity with a TOF of 8382 h−1 when the reaction time is 2 h at a temperature below 100 °C. Triol glycerol is another promising reagent in the C3 alcohols with hydrogen capacity of 8.76 wt%. The dehydration of glycerol not only produces H2, but also generates lactic acid as a valuable byproduct. An efficient catalytic system was reported to display an unprecedented activity for the triol glycerol dehydrogenation with TOF of 11,060 h−1 after 2 h (0.52 ppm Ru-MACHO, 1.5 MKOH, 125 °C), which is 300-fold higher than the benchmark value reported in 1980s [79b]. The TOF of reaction could be increased to 84,072 h−1 under optimized conditions with extended reaction time of 12 h. Nevertheless, the lactic acid yield of 67% could be achieved through the use of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as the solvent with 7.3 M NaOH at 140 °C, where the catalytic activity is as high as 26,000 h−1. More recently, TiO2/rGO/Pt photocatalysts were explored to produce hydrogen from both synthetic and crude glycerol under the irradiation of visible light [79c]. In this photo-reforming system, the operating parameters were investigated in detail, and the highest hydrogen generation rate could up to 70.8 and 12.7 mmolg− 1 g −1 using the synthetic and crude glycerol, respectively. The hydrogen production was influenced by variety effects, involving the fraction of glycerol, solution pH, catalyst loading amount, temperature, light source, the incorporated amount of GO nanosheets and Pt nanoparticles, and impurities in the glycerol. C4 alcohols, such as 1,4-butanedol and n-butanol, are regarded as a link between the complex alcohols derived from biomass and simple monohydric alcohols. They were investigated as potential hydrogen carriers as well. A traditional catalyst [RuH2(N2)(PPh3)3] was reported to convert n-butanol (hydrogen capacity = 13.6 wt%) to the corresponding aldehyde with TOF of 500 h−1 [80a]. So far, the highest catalytic activity for C4 alcohols was found as Ru-MACHO, which reached a TOF of 1330 h−1 after 3 h at 130 °C [80b]. A one-pot protocol was demonstrated for catalytic hydrogen generation of mono-saccharides, disaccharide, cellulose and lignocellulose by using a ppm amount of pincer-type iridium catalyst IrH2Cl(PNP i Pr) at low temperature (bellow 120 °C) [80c]. In the solution of diglyme with 1.5 equiv NaOH at 95 °C, the mono-saccharides l-(−)-fructose and d-(+)-glucose achieved a high dehydrogenation activity of TOF as 5560 h−1. IrH2Cl(PNP i Pr) also displayed good catalytic activity for cellulose (TOF = 3400 h−1) when the polysaccharide solubility is improved in an optimized condition. More specifically, the TON for lignocellulose from bamboo reached up to 3000. Most interestingly, even the used cigarette filters contained cellulose acetate can produce H2 under the optimized conditions with a TON of 630. This protocol provides an opportunity for applying lingo cellulosic biomass through heterogenerous catalysis procedures instead of well-known enzymatic fermentation processes."
9,"Ammonia, hydrous hydrazine, and primary amines",
10,Ammonia,"4.1 Ammonia Ammonia (NH3) is regarded as an activated nitrogen building block for materials synthesis in both natural processes and chemical industry [81]. Its global production reached 176 million metric tons in the year of 2014. It contains high hydrogen capacity (17.8 wt%), and can be used directly as a fuel in internal combustion engines or solid oxide fuel cells. Ammonia is a promising hydrogen carrier with a relatively high volumetric energy density (108 kg-H2/m3 NH3 at 8.6 bar and 20 °C) and gravimetric energy density (17.8 wt%). The mass and density of various hydrogen vectors are illustrated in Fig. 14 [81e]. When storing the same amount of hydrogen, the required weight and volume of metal amine salts (e.g. Ca(NH3)8Cl2 and Mg (NH3)6Cl2) is significantly less than that of metal hydrides (e.g. Mg2NiH4, LaNi5H6, and NaALH4). In contrast to FA and alcohols, hydrogen generation from the decomposition of NH3 does not involve the liberation of carbon dioxide. Numerous catalysts were investigated for the ammonia decomposition reaction, which normally proceeds only at temperatures above 650 °C, way beyond the operating temperature of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) (∼ 85 °C) in mobile applications [81c,d]. Furthermore, the functionality of PEMFCs is sensitive to the ammonia, whereby even 1 ppm ammonia in the air will poison the catalyst. A more feasible alternative is required for applying ammonia in stationary applications combining with solid oxide fuel cells, which operated at around 800 °C [81f, 81 g]. Thus, to attain higher energy efficiency, developing new catalysts that completely decompose ammonia to release pure hydrogen at a lower temperature (below 450 °C) is critically necessary. 4.1.1 COx-free hydrogen production from ammonia decomposition In the past decade, many researchers have been working on developing better-performing catalysts for the production of COx-free hydrogen from ammonia decomposition. The catalytic activity of a series of metallic complex for ammonia dehydrogenation was in the order of Ru > Ni > Rh > Co > Ir > Fe >> Pt > Cr > Pd > Cu >> Te, Se, Pb [81h]. The noble metal Ru complex is considered as the most active metallic catalyst. Its high cost and low availability, however, makes extensive employment in actual applications rather difficult. Typically, multi-component catalysts processes involve alloy nanoparticles, promoter, and support materials to decompose ammonia. By changing the support material, promoter, and composition of alloy nanoparticles, the physical structure of the catalyst and/or the electronic structure of the active sites can be positively regulated, resulting in higher performance in ammonia dehydrogenation. An impressive work was reported by Torrente-Murciano and coworkers using cesium promoted Ru-based NPs anchored on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to produce hydrogen in-situ at low temperature (590 K) [82a]. Cs located on the surface of metal ruthenium and near to the CNT surface, behaved as a strong electron donor that modify the electronic structure of the ruthenium. The yielded Ru/MWCNT composite displayed a strong effect in reducing the activation barrier of ammonia decomposition and the catalytic activity increased with the Cs loading. The ammonia dehydrogenation rate initially increase with the increase of the Cs/Ru ratio in the Ru/MWCNT composite while an excess Cs loading in the catalyst could decrease the Ru active sites and resulting in the slow reaction speed. Ru-based complexes exhibited the highest activity in the ammonia decomposition, and the decomposition rate can be further improved with the doping of alkali metal hydroxides. A LiOH-promoted Ru-based catalyst was recently explored to show a high TOF of 17.7 s−1 at a temperature as low as 623 K, while the unmodified pure Ru catalyst only revealed a TOF of 2.7 s−1 under the same conditions [82b]. The dehydrogenation performance can be significantly altered by varying the catalyst-support materials. A MgO supported Ru-based catalyst was synthesized by deposition precipitation approach to dehydrogenate ammonia. A high density of basic sites and a suitable Ru particle size could be achieved due to the application of support precursor material 4MgCO3•Mg(OH)2•4H2O. Therefore, the as-prepared Ru catalyst performed high activity in the COx-free hydrogen generation with robust stability in the long-term run (over 100 h) [82c]. A support material of Ba-ZrO2 was prepared to immobilize Ru NPs for the production of COx-free hydrogen from ammonia decomposition [82d]. Because the formation of BaZrO3 phase in the supporting material, strong electron-donating ability, intimate metal-support interaction and highly dispersed Ru NPs were achieved. Feng and co-workers investigated the catalysis of ammonia dehydrogenation using Ru/La2O3 complex at temperatures 300–550 °C. A high ammonia conversion of 90.7% was obtained at 525 °C (TOF = 1537.6 h−1) [82e]. The high costs of Ru-based catalysts has made them relatively unattractive for ammonia decomposition processes in real-life applications. Recently, Wang et al. explored an excellent high-entropy alloy (HEA) catalyst using low-cost earth abundant elements (i.e. Co, Mo, Fe, Ni, and Cu) (Fig. 15 a) [83a]. In the decomposition of ammonia, the obtained CoMoFeNiCu NPs exhibited robust stability and outstanding catalytic performance, with a 20-fold improvement in comparison with using the Ru catalyst. By estimating the nitrogen adsorption energies, it was revealed that the catalytic activity can be tuned by the HEA composition. On the Co-rich left side (Fig. 15b), the weak binding between N and catalyst resulted in a high kinetic barrier for decomposition, while on the Mo-rich right side, the binding was too strong for N to desorb from the HEA surface. Therefore, by varying the Co/Mo ratio, the HEA could exhibit tailorable catalytic activity to fit different reaction conditions. Zhang group prepared the CoxFe3-xO4@mSiO2 composite which was reported to exhibited high ammonia dehydrogenation performance [83b]. The as-prepared catalyst was stable for 2 days with the ammonia conversion of 88% at 600 °C. The high ammonia decomposition performance was ascribed to several reasons: (1) large specific surface areas, (2) the intimate Fe-Co interaction, and (3) the unique mesoporous SiO2 shells. Through changing the chemical stoichiometry of CoxFe3-xO4 nanosheets, the nitrogen desorption ability could be tailored which led to the positive altering in catalytic activity. A CeO2 supported Ni catalyst was recently explored by Lucentini et al. [83c] Ascribed to a particular metal-support interaction, the Ni/CeO2 sample demonstrated higher catalytic activity in the ammonia dehydrogenation reaction compared to its alumina-supported counterparts. Very recently, the carbon supported Co-based catalysts were investigated to catalyze COx-free hydrogen from ammonia in the microwave reactor. Due to the strong microwave energy, ammonia completely decomposed at low temperatures from 350 to 400 °C under pure ammonia flow (GHSVNH3 of 36,000 ml/gcat.h) [83d]. 4.1.2 Hydrogen storage via ammonia formation The Haber–Bosch process is a well-developed ammonia synthesis technology with the first-generation heterogeneous catalytic system for the main industrial production of NH3 and still in service today. The process converts N2 from atmosphere into NH3 through the reaction with H2 by employing a metal catalyst (typically an iron catalyst) under high pressures and high temperatures. However, the Haber-Bosch process is energy consuming and not sustainable. The sustainable NH3 production required the discovery of new methods for N2 fixation under ambient conditions. In past few decades, a lot of efforts have been investigated to develop catalytic systems for N2 fixation under mild synthesis conditions to generate NH3 and other valuable nitrogen-containing materials. These include electro-catalysis, electro-catalytic reduction, non-thermal plasma catalysis, photo-catalysis, and enzymatic catalysis [84–90]. This section collates the latest development of the sustainable NH3 production approaches. One of the very first methods to prepare ammonia under ambient condition is through electro-chemical process. Typically, the electro-chemical reduction of N2 follows the following simple model (Eqs. (4.1)–(4.4)): (4.1) H + + e − + * K H ↔ * H (4.2) N 2 + * K N ↔ * N 2 (4.3) H + + e − + * N 2 k N → * N 2 H (4.4) H + + e − + * H k H → H 2 + * * = ative site on the catalyst; K = equilibrium constants In the electrochemical reduction of N2, the first hydrogenation was regarded as the rate-determining step, thus the rate of step (3) determined the rate of NH3 generation. Step (1) was faster than step (4), the backward reactions of step (3) and (4) were neglected due to the low conversion. However, this method is limited mainly by the low selectivity toward NH3 over H2 [84c]. A qualitative model of electro-chemical N2 reduction suggested that the selectivity of NH3 can be improved through limiting either proton or electron availability at the surface [84c]. The electro-catalytic reduction of N2 to NH3 (N2 + 6H+ + 6e− → 2NH3) is an emerging pathway to complement the Haber-Bosch process used in chemical industry [86], because of its environmentally benignity and energy saving properties. It can even be powered by renewable solar and wind energy. It expands the operating conditions of NH3 synthesis from high temperature N2/H2 steams to very mild ones, which could promote the NH3 synthesis to the on-site production of carbon free fertilizers by using natural power, such as sunlight. Catalysts such as Co/BaCeO3−xNyHz and 5LiH-Fe/MgO showed reasonable activities at all temperatures, but the competition between high activity and poor selectivity was needed to be addressed at low temperature (< 100 °C). The low electronic/ionic conductivity of materials should therefore be considered at intermediate to high temperature (> 500 °C). To date, the systems for intermediate temperatures were close to the real application. Recently, Zhao et al. activated single-wall boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) by encapsulating metals for catalytic synthesis of NH3 from N2 (Fig. 16 ) [86b]. The first principles calculations and micro-kinetic modeling suggested that the encapsulating early transition metals (e.g. Ti, Zr, V, Cr and Sc) in BNNTs can break the π conjugation of BN network and release the pz orbitals of B atoms for N2 activation. NH3 synthesis was conducted through associating N2 hydrogenation in the enzymatic route. Through changing the metal filler and BNNTs diameter, the binding strength of reaction molecules and intermediates on the B reaction center can be efficiently tuned. For example, the maximum TOF is 2.61 × 10−5 s−1 site−1 (at 700 K, and 100 bar) with 25% of the N2/(N2 + H2) ratio was achieved for Ti/BNNT with tube diameter of around 1.1 nm, which was competitive to that of Fe catalyst. The TOF could be further improved through enhancing the N2 adsorption by increasing the N2 partial pressure. The nonthermal atmospheric plasma catalysis ammonia synthesis has been widely explored and found to exhibit great potential for practical applications. In such system, metal catalysts (such as Ru-, Ni-, and Mg- complex) that have been employed together with different plasma discharges (such as the dielectric barrier discharge (DBD)) to stimulate the cleaving of the triple nitrogen bond to prepare ammonia at low temperatures. Recently, NH3 synthesis via atmospheric DBD plasma discharge over zeolite 5A was demonstrated by Carreon et al. [87] The zeolite in the DBD reactor prompted the generation of micro-discharges and an obvious change of voltage-current characteristics, which would promote the dissociation of N2, resulting in an improved catalytic activity. The energy yield reached 15.5 g-NH3/kW h at the equal molar ratio of N2 to H2 with zeolite 5A, which was 50-fold higher than that of catalytic system without zeolite. A plasma-enhanced catalytic preparation of NH3 was developed at 35 °C and ambient pressure in a water-electrode designed coaxial dielectric DBD reactor using transition metal catalysts (M/Al2O3, M = Fe, Ni, Cu) [88]. Fig. 17 shows a schematic diagram of the experimental setup for a plasma-enhanced catalytic preparation of NH3. The incorporation of catalyst significantly improved the NH3 production rate and energy efficiency, with their activities were in the order: Ni/Al2O3 > Cu/Al2O3 > Fe/Al2O3 > Al2O3. All catalysts maintained stable performances for 6 h, and Ni/Al2O3 kept high efficiency after five catalytic cycles. The plasma-catalytic preparation of NH3 using Ni/Al2O3 showed the highest production rate as 471 μmol g−1 h−1, which was 100% higher than that of plasma preparation without catalyst. Notable differences for the discharge of all catalysts were not observed, indicating the enhanced catalytic activities were dominated by the chemistry factors of catalyst surface over its physical effects. The weak acid sites of Al2O3 could affect the performance of catalysts during the NH3 synthesis. Ni/Al2O3 exhibited a more uniform plasma discharge than Al2O3 or plasma, which was the key factor to enhance the radical reactions of N, H and NH in gas phase and reactions on the catalyst surface. The acid surface of Ni/Al2O3 reduced the amount of medium and strong acid sites in the reaction, which would improve the synthesis rate of ammonia. The synergy was also affected by strength of M-N bond (Ni-N < Cu-N < Fe-N), in which the weakest Ni-N bond may inhibit NH3 decomposition and enhance the TOF of NH3 synthesis though reducing the energy for dissociating NH3 from the catalyst surface. Synthesis of ammonia under ambient condition by photo-driven N2 fixation has drawn increasing attention. It is a sustainable and resilient method to produce nitrogen-containing commodities, such as fuels and fertilizers [85]. The first photo-catalytic NH3 synthesis was reported 75 years ago, which focused primarily on titania catalysts. Since then, a series of catalytic systems based on wide materials library were demonstrated for the photo-catalytic NH3 synthesis, including natural materials (e.g. soils and desert sands), titania based materials (e.g. Fe2Ti2O7), semiconductor materials (e.g. BiOBr and ZnO), transition metal based materials (e.g. Ru/TiO2), biomimetic materials (e.g. nitrogenase enzymes), carbon materials (e.g. C60 and graphene) and polymeric materials (e.g. conducting polymer composites) [85]. Furthermore, the cadmium sulfide (CdS)/molybdenum-iron (MoFe) protein biohybrids provide a photo-chemical model for achieving light-driven N2 reduction to NH3 under mild condition (Fig. 18 ) [89]. CdS nanocrystals could photosensitize the nitrogenase MoFe protein, in which the resulted energy by light harvesting replaced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis to drive the enzymatic reduction of N2 to NH3. The turnover rate was reported to be 75 min−1, which was 63% that of the ATP-coupled reaction rate for nitrogenase. Photocatalytic N2 fixation exhibits great potential to prepare ammonia under mild condition. However, further investigations are needed to study the catalysts’ working mechanisms, enhance the performance of catalysts, as well as to improve the device configuration. Typically, the catalysts for N2 fixation and reduction were based on the metals or metal complexes, as described above. Recently, Légaré et al. reported a non-metal di-coordinated borylene showed capability to bind and reduce N2 [90]. In this system, N2 binding to two borylene units generated in either neutral (B2N2) or dianionic ([B2N2]2 −) products using potassium graphite as a reductant, which can be inter-converted by exposure to further reductant or to air, respectively. These results provided a key evidence for N2 activation by the p block elements. Besides, the reduction of N2 to NH3 by nitrogenase was conducted through delivering protons and electrons to molecules that was bounded on the catalytic metal cluster site of FeMocofactor [84a]. A mediated cyclic voltammetry provided a quantitative analysis of electron flowing to nitrogenase. The analysis of system indicated a catalytic rate of 14 s−1, which is limited by the nitrogenase function instead of the electro-chemical system. The reported method can be used to solve the conundrum in the introgenase study, suggesting that the electron flowing through nitrogenase is obviously inhibited by increasing the N2 partial pressures. As mentioned previously, the main hurdle in the hydrogen storage using NH3 is the sustainable synthesis of ammonia under near ambient conditions. Though the Haber–Bosch process is widely used for ammonia production in industry, it requires high temperature and pressure for N2 fixation, and that consumes energy. Hence, large scale ammonia production under ambient conditions through such as photocatalytic nitrogen fixation, plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis, and electro-catalysis are promising on-going and future research direction."
11,Hydrous hydrazine,"4.2 Hydrous hydrazine 4.2.1 Hydrogen production from the dehydrogenation of hydrous hydrazine Anhydrous hydrazine (H2NNH2), with a hydrogen capacity as high as 12.5 wt%, is a liquid at room temperature. According to the catalysts and reaction conditions, the decomposition of hydrazine can be divided into two ways: (1) complete decomposition (equation 4–5) and (2) incomplete decomposition (equation 4–6). Whereas, anhydrous hydrazine is difficult to use safely, because of its hypergolic nature and will cause explosion if exposed to metal catalysts surface. Therefore, from the view of safety, anhydrous hydrazine is not a feasible hydrogen storage materials. Nevertheless, in contrast to anhydrous hydrazine, hydrous hydrazine%, is safer for handling and applied in hydrogen generation. For example, hydrazine monohydrate, H2NNH2•H2O (hydrogen content =7.9 wt%), can decompose and regenerate in a safe way [91]. Additionally, hydrous hydrazine is easy recharged using the current infrastructure of liquid fuels, and only generate nitrogen as the byproduct when complete decomposition to hydrogen. These advantages of hydrous hydrazine make it a highly promising medium for hydrogen storage. (4.5) H2NNH2 → N2(g)+2H2(g) (4.6) 3H2NNH2 → 4NH3 + N2(g) Xu group demonstrated that the key to effectively decompose hydrous hydrazine to generate hydrogen is to develop efficient and selective catalysts [91a]. Through the screening of the catalytic activity of a series of metal nanoparticles, including Co, Ru, Ir, Cu, Ni, Fe, Pt, and Pt nanoparticle-catalysts, Xu and colleagues found that the Rh(0) NPs displayed the highest selective (∼ 44%) for hydrogen production from hydrous hydrazine decomposition at ambient conditions. Whereas, other metal NPs exhibited low or even no selectivity for hydrogen. In contrast to the monometallic metal catalyst, alloy materials showed distinct bind properties with reactants and leading to the improvement of hydrogen selectivity. Via suitable selection and control over the composition of alloy catalysts, highly efficient catalysts with excellent selective are achievable. For instance, to achieve higher selectivity for hydrogen by the room-temperature decomposition of hydrous hydrazine, an Rh-Ni nanoparticle-catalyst was developed by Xu and co-workers. By suitable control of the ratio of Rh and Ni, 100% hydrogen selectivity was obtained [91b]. In addition to noble metal nanoparticles, Xu group also found that cost-effective non-noble metal nanoparticles (i.e. Ni-Fe alloy nanoparticles) exhibited excellent catalytic performance for the complete decomposition of hydrous hydrazine [91c]. In a basic solution, the bimetallic NiFe NPs showed 100% hydrogen selectivity from hydrous hydrazine decomposition at 343 K, which was much better than their parent metal nanoparticles. They demonstrated that the high hydrogen selectivity was ascribed to the distinct surface properties of different non-noble metals. Though bimetallic Ni-Pt nano-catalysts showed 100% selectivity for the hydrazine decomposition reaction in aqueous solution have been reported a decade ago, the TOF of the catalyst was relatively low with the best value of 7.9 h−1 for Ni0.69Pt0.31 at ambient reaction conditions [91d]. Supported metal catalysts were intensively studied own to their outstanding performance in the complete hydrazine decomposition reaction. As the template supporting materials facilitate the good dispersion of nanoparticles, prepared nano-catalysts with ultrafine size, and exhibiting dramatically enhanced catalytic activity. For example, Cheng and coworkers synthesized ultrafine monodisperse alloy NiPt NPs by coreduction of nickel acetylacetonate and platinum acetylacetonate [91e]. The obtained Ni84Pt16 NPs were deposited on graphene and exhibited 100% hydrogen selectivity for the hydrous hydrazine decomposition, with TOF values of 415 h−1 at 50 °C, and 133 h−1 at 25 °C. Recently, Xu and co-workers prepared ultrafine and uniformly alloy nanocatalysts by immobilized the bimetallic Pt-Ni NPs on 3-dimensional N-doped graphene networks (NGNs) through a facile wet chemical reduction method [91f]. NGN-supported Pt0.5Ni0.5 NPs exhibit extremely high catalytic activity for the dehydrogenation of hydrazine hydrate, achieving 100% H2 selectivity with a high TOF value of 943 h−1 at 303 K, which is the highest TOF value reported at that time. Very recently, Xu group prepared another ultrafine bimetallic PtNi nanoparticles (with an average size of 1.8 nm) by immobilizing the PtNi nanoparticles on a MOF based zirconia/porous carbon/reduced graphene oxide support (Fig. 19 ) [91 g]. The obtained highly dispersed ultrafine PtNi nanoparticles exhibited a significantly improved catalytic activity for the complete decomposition of hydrous hydrazine to produce hydrogen, with an extremely high TOF of 1920 h−1 at 323 K. They disclosed that high catalytic activity was ascribed to (1) the small size effect; (2) the strong synergistic effect between Pt and Ni atoms; and (3) the strong metal-support interactions. 4.2.2 Hydrogen storage via the formation of hydrous hydrazine The key to the hydrazine-based hydrogen storage system is the effectively conversion of the by-product (i.e. nitrogen) back to hydrazine. Normally, instead of nitrogen gas, nitrogen containing materials (i.e. ammonia or urea) are used as starting materials for the production of hydrazine. For example, the Rasching process, as shown below (Eqs. (4.7)–(4.9)): (4.7) 2NaOH + Cl2 → NaOCl + NaCl + H2O (4.8) NaOCl + NH3 → NH2Cl + NaOH (4.9) 2NH3+NH2Cl → N2H4+NH4Cl As the direct recycling of nitrogen back to hydrazine has not been established, ammonia remains a valuable starting material for the production of hydrazine. In the future, seek an economic and practical method for recycling nitrogen to hydrazine is crucial for the sustainable development of hydrogen technology."
12,Some primary amines and their corresponding nitriles,"4.3 Some primary amines and their corresponding nitriles In addition to ammonia and hydrous hydrazine, some primary amines and their corresponding nitriles are promising hydrogen carriers [92].The RCH2NH2/RCN pair was considered as the potential hydrogen energy carriers recently, due to the development of primary amine dehydrogenation by an oxidant-free process without hydrogen acceptor. Both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of RCH2NH2 can be efficiently catalyzed under rather mild conditions by ruthenium complexes [92a]. An oxidant-free, acceptor-less, and chemo-selective dehydrogenation of primary and secondary amines to the corresponding nitriles and imines with H2 was developed by using an amide-derived NNN-Ru(II) hydride complex [92b]. The catalyst system is tolerable for oxidizing functionality and selective for the dehydrogenation of primary amines (-CH2NH2) in the presence of amines without α-CH hydrogens. The oxidative conversion of primary amines to nitriles have been widely recorded, however, this complex is the firstly reported homogeneous catalyst to conduct the reaction in good yields without additives. The dehydrogenation of primary amines to nitriles with the H2 production was successfully catalyzed by the ruthenium complexes [(p-cym)-Ru(NHC)Cl2] (NHC = N-heterocyclic carbene), in which the reaction is conducted under air and mild conditions without any additive and acceptor [92c]. Nevertheless, the ruthenium complex supported on the surface of graphene still kept its catalytic activity after 10 catalytic cycles. Thus, those advantages obtained in terms of catalytic activity, stability, and recyclability indicated its potential application of the amine/nitrile pair as a LOHC. However, the selective dehydrogenation is still challenge, such as controlling transamination reactions to avoid the imine formation."
13,Liquid organic hydrogen carriers,"The LOHC system consists of the couple of hydrogen-lean and hydrogen-rich organic molecules, in which H2 can be reversible stored and released via repeating catalytic hydrogenation/dehydrogenation cycles [93,94]. In the previously mentioned liquid hydrogen storage media (i.e. formic acid, alcohols, and ammonia), the dehydrogenation products are gas mixtures (H2 and CO2 or N2), imposing difficulty in the obtaining H2 through purification process. In contrast, the hydrogen-lean molecules used in the LOHC systems are normally high-boiling-point compounds, facilitating the isolation of hydrogen gas from the dehydrogenation product stream through condensation, rendering the LOHC system a powerful hydrogen vector in practical applications. Normally, LOHCs with relatively high hydrogen content, low toxic features, stable chemical properties, and high reversibility are used, contributing to ease of storage, handling, and transportation. Additionally, LOHC systems are economically attractive options. In an off-grid self-supply power station, such as an isolated tourist attraction, the price for electricity generation from fossil-based fuel (i.e. diesel) (around 6 €/kWh) can cover the total cost for LOHCs production and storage [93e]. Moreover, they enable compatibility with existing industrial assets, such as barges, tank trucks, and wagons, further reducing the cost for the overall storage system. A H2 storage and release cycle based on LOHC systems contains an exothermic hydrogenation process and an endothermic dehydrogenation process. Fig. 20 a showed the catalytic (de)hydrogenation reaction for a LOHC system. Currently, two main LOHC systems have been developed, which are the aromatic hydrocarbons and the N-heteroaromatics, respectively [93e]. Table 2 and Fig. 20b summarized the selected LOHCs and their hydrogen storage properties."
14,Hydrogen storage/release based on aromatic hydrocarbon LOHCs,"5.1 Hydrogen storage/release based on aromatic hydrocarbon LOHCs The early studies of aromatic hydrocarbon type LOHC systems for hydrogen storage were mainly focused on the toluene (TOL)/methylcyclohenxane (MCH) couple (6.1 wt% H2). While high heat is produced in the MCH dehydrogenation process (−68.3 kJ/mol H2), the harsh conditions are necessary to completely decompose MCH. Progress in LOHC technology was achieved through the use of other aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, including benzene/cyclohexane (CHE), naphthalene/decalin, monobenzyltoluene (H0-MBT)/perhydromonobenzyltoluene (H12-MBT), and dibenzyltoluene (H0-DBT)/perhydrodibenzyltoluene (H18-DBT) (Table 2). The H0-DBT/ H18-DBT couple (6.2 wt% H2) is an attractive example of the aromatic hydrocarbon-based LOHC system. It integrates the basic requirements of a safe LOHC system for real applications, including wide liquid ranges (mp = −34 °C and bp = 390 °C for H0-DBT), good thermal robustness, low flammability and low toxicity. Besides, the H0-DBT/ H18-DBT system has been used in large-scale as heat transfer oil (traded as “Marlotherm”). The hydrogenation reaction of hydrogen-lean molecules can be tuned by controlling various parameters, such as the catalyst, the reaction reactor, and reaction conditions. Fig. 21 shows the hydrogenation of toluene into MCH using Ni/SiO2 as catalyst in a packed reactor [95a]. The selective conversion of toluene to MCH was studied under partial steam pressures (0–10 KPa), at different molar ratios of H2/toluene (1–5) and temperature (393–453 K). By using dry H2, the toluene conversion up to 100% with increasing H2 partial pressure to 10 kPar at 120 °C, while the MCH selectivity was decreased with temperature increasing. In the case of wet H2, the toluene conversion kept almost constant under whole range of steam pressures, but the MCH selectivity was enhanced with increasing steam partial pressure. These results suggested that the incorporation of steam inhibited the formation of by-products during the toluene hydrogenation process. The NH3-TPD experiment indicated that the occupation of the Brønsted acid sites on the surface of Ni/SiO2 by H2O decreased reaction sites for side reactions. An industrial 5 wt% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (particle size: 1.4 ± 0.4 nm) was studied to catalyze the charging of toluene, in which n-fold coordinated Pt-hydrides and four different types of linear Pt-hydrides were identified and characterized by many analytical technologies, such as synchronous DRIFT/XAS/MS, FT-IR spectroscopy and inelastic neutron scattering [95b]. The n-fold coordinated Pt-hydrides were converted into linear ones when reducing H2 coverage and vice versa, due to a morphological and electronic reconstruction of Pt NPs. Thus, for the dynamics of Pt NPs in the hydrogenation, only a partial surface of Pt-hydrides was directly involved in the toluene hydrogenation, and the other parts would maintain the morphological and electronic stability of Pt NPs to avoid the catalyst deactivation. An efficient catalyst system comprising of Ru2P/SiO2 for toluene hydrogenation was developed through screening a group of transition metals and metal phosphides supported on silica (M/SiO2 and MxPy/SiO2, M = Pt, Pd, Ir, Rh, Ru, Ni, and Co) [95c]. The phosphidation of noble metals (Pt, Pd and Ir) strongly decreased their catalytic activates in toluene hydrogenation. In contrast, the catalytic activity of Ru was significantly enhanced by 26-folds through phosphidation. Ru2P/SiO2 displayed a good catalytic activity comparable to other Pt group metals but with much lower cost. The improved catalytic activity of Ru by phosphidation was mainly contributed by the special surface structure of Ru2P, which exhibited large electron-deficient Ru ensembles to enhance toluene absorption for hydrogenation. The charging and discharging of DBT-based LOHC system were also well established [94a, 96]. Wasserscheid and colleagues investigated the hydrogenation process of H0-DBT using 1H NMR to reveal the reaction pathway [96b]. They reported that the two side phenyl rings of H0-DBT were hydrogenated prior to the middle phenyl ring with a Ru/Al2O3-catalyst at temperatures between 120 °C and 200 °C and a pressure of 50 bar. This result was further confirmed by HPLC analysis. More recently, the catalytic dehydrogenation of H18-DBT was investigated by systematic method [93b]. By using 1 wt% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the degree of dehydrogenation could be increased from 40% to 90% by increasing temperature from 290 to 320 °C. However, the temperature increase would increase the formation of by-product, leading poorer purity of H2. The degree of dehydrogenation could be furtherly increased to 96% when 2 wt% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was applied at 320 °C. The reaction kinetics study indicated the H18-DBT dehydrogenation performed in first order, and the activation energies for 1 wt% Pt/Al2O3, 1 wt% Pd/Al2O3 and 1:1 wt% Pt-Pd/ Al2O3 catalysts were 205, 84 and 66 kJ•mol−1, respectively. Wasserscheid‘s group also investigated the dehydrogenation of H18-DBT, which produced hydrogen using Pt/C with 1% metal loading at temperature 290 °C with more than 95% conversion [96a]. Recently, they discovered that by applying of the same reactor for both charging and discharging of LOHC systems, a higher energy efficiency could be achieved [96c]. The typical H18-DBT dehydrogenation catalyst (such as Pt on alumina) exhibited activity in the H0-DBT hydrogenation reaction at temperature over 220 °C. Based on the interesting hydrogen storage strategy, they used a Pt on alumina catalyst for both the hydrogenation of H0-DBT and the dehydrogenation of H18-DBT at temperatures range from 290 to 310 °C by just varying the hydrogen pressure (Fig. 22 ). They described that in a hot pressure swing reactor, the heat generated by the hydrogenation reaction could be used for the dehydrogenation process. Very recently, they discovered a simple pre-dried and pre-purified approach to obtain high purity hydrogen (>99.999%) from the dehydrogenation of H18-DBT with only a trace amount of CO recording (below 0.2 ppmv) [96d]."
15,Hydrogen storage/release based on N-heterocyclic LOHCs,"5.2 Hydrogen storage/release based on N-heterocyclic LOHCs Aromatic hydrocarbon molecules are widely used for hydrogen storage. However, they have the drawback of relatively high heat generation during (de)hydrogenation reactions. For example, TOL and H0-DBT generate 68.3 kJ/mol and 65 kJ/mol heat during the hydrogenation, respectively. In order to reduce the heat of (de)hydrogenation, a series of N-heteroaromatics-based LOHC systems were developed and screened. These include N-ethylcarbazole (H0-NEC)/dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole (H12-NEC), indole/indoline, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline/quinolone, pyridines/piperidines, and perhydronaphthyridines/naphthyridines [97]. The H0-NEC/ H12-NEC system (Fig. 23 ), with 5.8 wt% H2 and 50 kJ/mol hydrogenation heat, is the most widely used N-heteroaromatic LOHC system for hydrogen storage and release. In addition, another LOHC system based on 2-aminoethanol/cyclic peptide glycine anhydride was reported to work under a mild condition (105–135 °C) with the use of homogeneous Ru-complex (carrying PNNH ligands) catalyst [97b]. Briefly, the incorporation of nitrogen in LOHC molecules would improve (de)hydrogenation thermodynamics and kinetics, the resulted systems exhibit much lower process temperature and reaction enthalpy to facilitate the H2 release. Thus, N-heteroaromatics based LOHC systems have received increasing attentions recently in both academic research and industrial applications. Here we summarize the latest developments on LOHC systems based on N-heteroaromatics. Smith and colleagues reported the charging of H0-NEC to form H12-NEC over a supported Ru catalyst at 7 MPa and 130–150 °C, in which hydrogenation followed the first-order kinetics with an apparent activation energy of 99.5 kJ•mol−1. The dehydrogenation of H12-NEC over a supported Pd catalyst at 101 kPa and 150–170 °C also followed the first-order kinetics with an apparent activation energy of 126.7 kJ•mol−1, in which 100% conversion and a maximum 69% recovery of the stored H2 were achieved at 170 °C [93c]. Recently, a highly active bifunctional Ru-Pd catalyst (Ru-Pd/Al2O3) was reported to exhibit excellent catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability in both charging and discharging the N-heteroaromatic-based LOHC system [97e]. Moreover, because of the synergistic effect between Ru and Pd, the catalytic performance of the as-synthesized catalyst was superior to that of the commercial Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. Suh and co-workers exploited a one-pot solvent deficient precipitation approach to effectively synthesize mesoporous palladium-alumina catalyst (MPdA) to dehydrogenate four different N-heterocyclic molecules (i.e. octahydroindole, decahydroquinoline, perhydro 2-methyl-6-(n-methylbenzyl)pyridine, and H12-NEC) at or below 250 °C [97b]. Using the newly designed MpdA complex, N-heterocyclic compounds were able to produce 20% more hydrogen than that with the conventional Pd/γ-AL2O3. Particularly, in the dehydrogenation of 2-(n-methylbenzyl)pyridine, no obvious deactivation was observed for the MPdA complex even after five consecutive runs. Such a high catalytic performance was ascribed to the intimate Pd-Al interaction and the well-dispersed palladium phase. A highly selective cobalt catalyst Co(BF4)2/L2 (in which L2 is tris(2-(diphenylphosphino) phenyl)phosphine ligand)was developed to hydrogenate quinolone and other related N-heterocycles with good yield under mild conditions [97c]. The incorporation of the modified tetradentate L2 ligand to the non-noble catalyst system enabled the selective hydrogenation of quinolone based N-heterocycles with a series of sensitive functional groups, such as carboxylic acid, cyclic imide, alkene, alkyne and aldehyde. As shown in Fig. 24 , the cobalt-based hybrids encapsulated cobalt nanoparticles (Co NPs) within the porous N-doped graphene displayed good performance in the selective hydrogenation of quinoline compounds to tetrahydro derivatives (THQs) with almost quantitative yields [97d]. In this system, quinoline could be catalytically converted to corresponding decahydroquinoline (DHQ, hydrogen capacity = 5.8 wt%) with 100% selectivity by CoOx@CN under 3 Mpa at 120 °C, achieving TOF of 6.5 h−1. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) of CoOx@CN indicated that Co NPs were well encapsulated inside the carbon layers, in which the defects surrounded carbon layers would the small channels for the reactions (Fig. 24c). The improved activity of catalysts was contributed by the encapsulation structure, which would extremely decrease the extent of leaching of metals to inhibit the growing of Co NPs."
16,Hydrogen storage/release based on alternative LOHC systems,"5.3 Hydrogen storage/release based on alternative LOHC systems In addition to the aromatic and N-heteroaromatic type LOHC systems, other organic molecules with the potential for reversible storage and release of hydrogen were also widely explored. These alternative LOHC systems include but are not limited to 2-aminoethanol-glycine anhydride system [98], ethylene urea-ethylenediamine system [99], methylpyridines/ methylpiperidines system [100], amine-alcohol systems [101], silane-alcohol system [102], ammonia-borane system [103], and amine-borane system [104]. A reversible LHOC system was developed based on a safe, cheap, and abundant organic molecules (i.e. 2-aminoethanol (AE)) [98]. In the dehydrogenation process, a Ru pincer catalyst (Ru/PNN), catalytically converted AE into a cyclic dipeptide glycine anhydride (GA) with the release of H2 at 89% yield at 105 °C. In the hydrogenation process, GA was hydrogenated to regenerate AE with 96% yield using the same catalyst at 110 °C (70 bar H2 pressure). However, in the repetitive cycles of dehydrogenation/hydrogenation reactions, the initial dehydrogenation and hydrogenation yields were 86% and 97%, respectively, which were still kept as 76% and 81% respectively, even after 3 repetitive cycles. A rechargeable LOHC system was developed based on the hydrogenation of ethylene urea (EU), and the dehydrogenation of ethylenediamine (EDA) and methanol using the same Ru-pincer complex RuHCl( t BuPNNH)(CO) as catalyst [99]. N-(2-aminoethyl) formamide was regarded as the important intermediated for the conversion between ethylene urea and N,N’-(ethane-1,2-diyl)diformamide. During dehydrogenation, EDA and methanol were converted to EU by Ru catalyst, which produced H2 with 99% yield at 150 °C; while in the hydrogenation process, EU was hydrogenated with high pressure H2 (60 bar) to regenerate EDA and methanol with 100% yield at 170 °C. This system exhibited a theoretically hydrogen capacity as high as 6.52 wt%, and high efficiency in the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation cycles. Two solvent-free LOHCs were developed based on a single heterogeneous supported Pd catalysts, in which 2-picoline/2-methylpiperidine and 2,6-lutidine/2,6-dimethylpiperidine exhibited theoretical HSC of 6.1 and 5.3 wt%, respectively [100]. The Pd supported by activated carbon (Pd/CHS) would be easily fabricated in situ by simple blending Pd(OAc)2 with activated carbon and methylpiperidines. The Pd/CHS could efficiently catalyze the dehydrogenation of 2-methylpiperidine and 2,6-dimethylpiperidine to 2-picoline (91% yield) and 2,6-lutidine in excellent yields (100% yield), while generating H2 with a fast rate. The mechanism study indicated that mild acids or acidic groups on the support surface could obviously accelerate the dehydrogenation of 2-methylpiperidine and 2,6-dimethylpiperidine. Nevertheless, the hydrogenation of both 2-picoline (2–7 bar) and 2,6-lutidine (1.6–5 bar) would be achieved under exceptionally low H2 pressure. And the Pd/CHS can be easily recovered and reused without an obvious decrease in catalytic activity. A simple homogeneous LOHC system was developed by employing ethylenediamine and ethanol as the hydrogen carriers, which is very different from the existing hydrogen storage systems. The H2 would be produced with excellent yields by the PNN ruthenium pincer complexes even with its loading value as low as 0.2 mol% without the addition of other stoichiometric additives. High concentrations of substrates, such as 5 mol ethylenediamine/mL dioxane and 12 mol ethanol/mL dioxane, did not decrease the catalytic efficiency of catalysts. The reactions still exhibited excellent conversions after three cycles even the catalyst loading value is 0.4 mol% [101a]. A hydrogen storage system based on the catalytic dehydrogenative coupling of 1,2-diamine and MeOH was studied by Prakash and co-workers. The related products, N-formamide and N,N’-diformamide would be hydrogenated to form amine and CH3OH by swing hydrogen pressure with good yields (> 90%). Thus, it acted as a clean source of H2 without CO2 or CO production. In theory, the CH3OH/amine hydrogen storage systems exhibited a hydrogen storage capacity as high as 6.6 wt% [101b]. Very recently, a LOHC system based on non-noble-metal catalysis was developed, in which the Mn-catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling of MeOH and N,N’-dimethylethylenediamine to form N,N’-(ethane-1,2-diyl)bis(N-methylformamide) with maximum selectivity of 97%, and the reverse hydrogenation reaction constitute a hydrogen storage system with a theoretical hydrogen capacity of 5.3 wt% [101c]. The silane/alcohol pair has received increasing attentions as a potential LOHC for energy storage recently. The compound [Ru(p-cym)(Cl)2(NHC)] was used for the coupling of silanes and alcohols at room temperature with the concomitant formation of H2 (TOF = 6000 h−1), in which high catalytic efficiency is found for a lot of substrates with quantitative conversion yields in minutes when catalyst loading value is as low as 0.1 mol% [102a]. The Ru catalyst would be immobilized onto the surface of graphene to benefit the easy separation and recyclability of catalyst. The catalytic activity was enhanced by the addition of rGO, due to the stability enhancement offered by the rGO. In addition, silanes and alcohols are environmentally friend compounds and no special handling precautions is required. These properties make the silane/alcohol pair as a good LOHC candidate for the real applications in the automotive industry. The dehydrogenative coupling reaction of silanes/alcohols demonstrated a convenient process for H2 generation using iridium catalysts [IrCp*(Cl)2(NHC)] [102b]. Quantitative yields of H2 could be obtained in less than 5 min at 30 °C by the coupling of dimethylphenylsilane and MeOH with a catalyst loading value of 0.5 mol%. The dehydrogenative coupling of 1,4-disilabutane and MeOH provided an effective hydrogen storage capacity of 4.3 wt%, which is as high as other LOHCs, such as formic acid (4.4 wt%). The iridium complex could be heterogenizated on graphene, which can be reused for at least 10 catalytic cycles without decreasing of catalytic activity. The metal-ion-doped zeolitic imidazolate frameworks have received increasing attentions for their structure tailorability and high catalytic activity [102c]. Cu ion-doped ZIF-8 nanocrystals could be prepared by the simply mechanical grinding of Cu(NO3)2, ZnO and 2-methylimidazole with ethanol as an additive. The XPS, X-ray and auger electron spectroscopy study indicated that Cu(II) and Cu(I) coexist in this Cu-doped ZIF-8. Because of the mixed valency of Cu ions, Cu-doped ZIF-8 displayed good catalytic performance in the dehydrogenative coupling of silanes and alcohols. For dehydrogenative coupling of dimethylphenylsilane with n-butanol, an Cu85%ZIF-8 nanocrystals generated H2 with a TOF of 34.9 h−1, and still displayed good activity after 5 catalytic cycles. A series of half-sandwich ruthenium(II) complexes RuCl2{η6:κ1(P)-C6H5(CH2) n OPR2}] would be easily prepared in two steps from the readily accessible phosphinite ligands R2PO(CH2) n Ph and dimers [{RuCl(μ-Cl)(η6-arene)}2] (arene = p-cymene, benzene) with isolated yields of 61–82% [102d]. Those complexes exhibited high activity for the dehydrogenative coupling of hydrosilanes and alcohols under mild conditions at room temperature and generated H2 smoothly, in which the TOF and TON values are up to 117 600 h−1 and 57 000, respectively. Ammonia borane (AB = NH3BH3, hydrogen capacity = 19.6 wt%) were studied extensively in recent years, probably due to its potential application as a chemical hydrogen-storage material [103a]. The generating H2 from AB would occur thermally without any catalyst, but the high temperatures and slow generating rate limit the real application of AB as a carrier for H2. However, the catalytic generating H2 from AB by metal catalysts can take place at a much lower temperature and generate H2 with a faster rate. The iridium pincer complex (POCOP)Ir(H)2 (POCOP) = [η 3–1,3-(OP t Bu2)2C6H3]) could catalyze the efficient production of H2 from AB at reasonable rates under mild conditions. The dormant form of the catalyst could be prepared from the reaction of BH3 with an Ir hydride, and the active species could be regenerated with H2. The reasonable rates and clean catalyst regeneration for this Ir pincer system under H2 demonstrate a promising initial step toward the development of AB as a potential hydrogen-storage material. A series of iron bis(phosphinite) pincer complexes with the formula of [2,6-( i Pr2PO)2C6H3]Fe-(PMe2R)2H (R = Me, 1; R = pH, 2) or [2,6-( i Pr2PO)2–4-(MeO)C6H2]Fe(PMe2Ph)2H (3) were prepared and applied for dehydrogenation of AB [103b]. All catalysts could release 2.3–2.5 equiv of H2 per AB in 24 h at 60 °C. Among of them, catalyst 3 exhibited the highest activity in terms of both the rate and the extent of H2 release, in which the initial rate for the dehydrogenation of AB is first order in 3 and zero order in AB. The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) for doubly labeled AB (k NH3BH3/k ND3BD3 = 3.7) is the product of individual KIEs (k NH3BH3/k ND3BH3 = 2.0 and k NH3BH3/k NH3BD3 = 1.7), indicating that B-H and NH bonds are simultaneously dissociated in the rate-determining step. NMR studies also suggested that the intermediated catalytic species is an AB-bound iron complex generated by displacing trans PMe3 or PMe2Ph with AB. A hetero-structure of Ni/Ni2P nanoparticles deposited on a defective carbon framework were fabricated via phosphorization, which exhibited good catalytic activity for the hydrolysis of AB due to their polarized chemical environment of interfacial components [103c]. Through optimizing the content ratio of Ni and Ni2P in the hybrid material, the H2 releasing from the catalytic hydrolysis of AB under neutral conditions would be efficiently improved with a TOF of 68.3 mol (H2) mol−1 (Cat) min−1 and an activation energy of 44.99 kJ mol−1, suggesting potential value as noble-metal-based catalysts in applications of hydrogen energy. A catalytic system AB@Pd/HNTs for pyrolysis releasing H2 from AB was prepared, in which the Pd catalyst was intergraded in natural halloysite nanotubes (HNTs), while AB was encapsulated in the HNTs channels by coating on the surface of HNTs as a uniform nanolayer [103d]. The catalytic efficiency of AB pyrolysis was enhanced by the ultra-small Pd nanocatalysts (∼1.4 nm) and the nanoconfinement of AB immobilized on HNTs, which not only inhibited the formation of byproducts, such as ammonia, diborane and borazine, but also restricted the foaming and expansion of AB during the reaction. Nevertheless, the nanoconfinement of AB immobilized on HNTs could improve the kinetics of H2 release at 60 °C, in which the activation energy of AB@Pd/HNTs is 46 kJ mol−1 (neat AB of 183 kJ mol−1). Those properties suggested that natural HNTs would be used for the formation of AB@Pd/HNTs hydrogen storage composites to enhance the dehydrogenation of AB. The copper ferrite was successfully prepared from glycine-nitrate precursor by combustion method, which then was applied for the AB hydrolysis. For both of hydrolysis and hydrothermolysis of AB, a cubic spinel Cu0.67Fe2.33O4 with Fe2+ higher content exhibited the highest activity when compared to other copper ferrite compounds [103e]. TEM and X-ray study indicated that copper ferrite was reduced to nano-sized Cu0 and Fe0 during the reaction. By incorporation of copper ferrite, the releasing rate of H2 for 1 g AB was increased from 30 to 76 ml•min−1, achieving the highest gravimetric hydrogen capacity of 7.3 wt% at 90 °C. In the past two decades, amine boranes have received increasing attentions because of potential value for chemical hydrogen storage. The dehydrogenation of azetidine-BH3 in situ is a potential candidate for hydrogen storage, which has been investigated for its rigorous structure and thermochemistry. The structural analyses were intergraded with gas electron diffraction and high-level quantum calculations, in which the route for H2 release reaction was predicted at the CBS-QB3 level using BH3 as a bifunctional catalyst [104a]. The catalyzed dehydrogenation route displayed an energy barrier lower than that of calculated BN bond dissociation energy, thus favoring the dehydrogenation reaction over the dissociation of material. The calculated enthalpy of dehydrogenation at the CCSD(T)/CBS level indicated that hydrogen release would be occurred under mild reaction conditions. In addition, the calculation also suggested that the reaction is exergonic, energetically feasible, and would take place spontaneously toward H2 release. A hydrogen storage platform based on well-defined BN heterocycle materials was demonstrated, in which a simple route for the hydrogenation of N-t-Bu-1,2-dihydro-1,2-azaborine to from related BN cyclohexane using H2 and H−/H+ sources [104b]. The crystallographic study of intermediates in the regeneration route established the structural assignments, which revealed the changes of unique bonding associated with the hydrogen content increasing on boron and nitrogen. Two well-defined Ti(III) metallocene complexes Cp*2TiMe (1Me) and Cp*2TiH (1H) (Cp* = η 5-C5Me5) was developed for the dehydropolymerization of RNH2•BH3 [104c]. Those catalysts combined advantages of high activity and cheap price. When compared to the late transition metal catalysts, 1Me exhibited reactivity toward various primary amine-boranes, including those containing reactive unites such as olefinic groups. The functionalized side chain in polyaminoborane [RNH-BH2]n offered a method to control their activities. The study of Me2NH•BH3 dehydrogenation supported a bond-metathesis/β-hydride elimination, and redox-neutral mechanism with a Ti(III)-H resting state. The Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst was fabricated by employing Ru-Rh precursors (particle size = 3.42 ± 0.33 nm) decorated on polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), which then was applied in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of MeAB with catalytic activity (TOFinitial = 206.2 min−1) [104d]. For the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of MeAB, the activation energy (Ea = 43.5 kJ/mol), activation enthalpy (ΔH = 41.18 kJ/mol) and activation entropy (ΔS = −104.25 J/mol K) were well calculated according to the standard methods. The MeAB can be 100% converted at room temperature. However, the catalyst could only keep its initial catalytic activity as 67.0% after 5 catalytic cycles. The rate of hydrogen release was 0.92nd order and 0.52nd order, which was strongly effected by catalyst and substrate concentrations, respectively. The rapid dehydrogenation of dimethylamine borane was occurred by reaction with a bidentate pyrrole based rhenium tetracarbonyl complex at room temperature [104e]. The generation of H2 could be detected at temperatures as low as 238 K, in which the initial formation of a Re-H-B σ bound adduct is supported by NMR spectroscopy. The rate of dehydrogenation was obviously affected by the electron density of the central metal and the property of the alkyl group on the ketone carbon of the pyrrole ligand, such as CH3 or CF3. Each LOCH medium has its sets of advantages and disadvantages. For example, N-heteroaromatics based LOHC systems (such as H0-NEC/H12-NEC) shows promising properties for hydrogen storage, such as mild dehydrogenation temperature, biodegradability and low vapor pressure. The hydrogenation/dehydrogenation of N-heteroaromatics based LOHC systems can take place under a milder condition with respect to the aromatic hydrocarbons systems. But they encounter the problem of low chemical stability of the N-alkyl bond which leads to poor reversibility and low decomposition conversion. Even though great achievements have been obtained, further efforts are still needed to increase the LOHC system working performance. The dehydrogenation temperature of common LOHCs (around 300 °C) are higher than the boiling point of some hydrogen-lean compounds (e.g. toluene bp 101 °C), leading to difficulty in the H2 purification. Consequently, developing of highly active catalysts is required to improve the (de)hydrogenation conversion and to minimize the generation of by-products in order to enhance the selectivity. Besides, designing a new reactor facilitate the treatment of the generated large gas and employment of the exhaust heat effectively. Due to the complex hydrogenation and dehydrogenation process of LOHCs, on-board storage applications are currently difficult. The temperature of the LOHCs dehydrogenation (∼300 °C) is far away from the PEMFC operation temperature (∼ 85 °C), and therefore, seeking new LOHC molecules with low enthalpy of reaction is desired. Several good review papers already reported the thermochemical and computational studies to find new potential LOHCs to fit the working conditions of PEMFCs [105]. The diphenyl ether derivatives, and N-alkycarbazole derivatives were considered as seminal candidates for LOHCs due to their high hydrogen storage capacity and very low volatility."
17,Conclusions and future perspectives,"In this review, we summarized the state-of-art liquid-phase hydrogen storage systems based on four types of liquid hydrogen-rich molecules, including formic acid, alcohols, ammonia, hydrous hydrazine, primary amines and LOHCs. These liquid hydrogen-rich molecules exhibit advanced features as hydrogen carriers, such as high hydrogen content, long-term stability, low-cost, non-flammability, and low-toxicity. More importantly, these molecules are compatible with existing energy infrastructures and can be easily transported by tank trucks. All of those advantages have created various applicable engineering possibilities, where the liquid-phase hydrogen storage systems can be implemented in stationary power stations, hydrogen logistics, mining, industry electrification, etc. However, the large-scale application of liquid-phase hydrogen storage systems as a clean energy source is still limited by several defects, such as harsh reaction conditions, low stability and recyclability of catalysts, the high price of noble catalysts, undesired side reactions, and the emission of harmful gasses. Thus, further optimization and innovation of hydrogen storage systems are urgently needed to achieve the economically feasible systems, which can be summarized as follows: (1) seeking new high-performance catalysts without supportive additives; (2) improving the catalytic activity by integrating the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis; (3) developing economical non-noble catalysts with high efficiency; and (4) exploring theoretical simulation methods for the new efficient hydrogen storage system to push forward the frontier of clean energy research. Interestingly, an intelligent combination of the advantages of diversified hydrogen-storage systems would generate a new system with better performance. For example, the hydrogen storage capacity, stability, and recyclability of a solid-state hydrogen storage substrate can be efficiently enhanced via functionalizing its porous nanostructures with hydrogen-rich groups. Those new findings may provide an alternative approach to obtain high efficient system though well integrating current hydrogen storage systems. Therefore, considered the development of materials chemistry and enormous new catalysts for the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation of liquid-phase hydrogen storage systems in the past few decades, we believe that breakthroughs in hydrogen storage based on liquid media will be continuously developed to generate sustainable hydrogen-based energy system in the near future."
