0,Introduction,"The consumption of fossil resources causes serious environmental problems such as global warming and air pollution. As major issues in the current world, there is an urgent need to stop CO2 levels increasing and to find new renewable energy sources to use instead of fossil fuels. Hydrogen production from water and solar energy (artificial photosynthesis) has received a great deal of attention while developing renewable and clean energy sources [1]. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been a leading photocatalyst for the production of H2 from H2O since the discovery of photoelectrochemical H2 evolution using TiO2 by Honda and Fujishima [2]. Photocatalytic water-splitting over TiO2 is initiated by charge-separation in TiO2 upon photoexcitation [3]. The electron reduces water to generate H2 while the hole oxidizes hydroxide to generate hydroxyl radicals [4]. In most cases, noble metals (Pt, Pd, and Au) are deposited onto the TiO2 to accelerate the reduction of water by electrons, and electron-donating sacrificial agents (hole scavengers) are added to accelerate the consumption of hydroxyl radicals, thus enhancing H2 evolution (sacrificial H2 production) [5,6]. In general, TiO2 can catalyze the three processes shown in Scheme 1. The photooxidation of organic compounds and pollutants with oxygen can easily proceed over TiO2, since it is an extremely down-hill process (Scheme 1A). Water-splitting into O2 and H2 (Scheme 1B) is not an easy process because of the large up-hill reaction and rapid reverse reaction. Sacrificial H2 production is an up-hill process but the energy change is small (Scheme 1C). Therefore, sacrificial H2 production proceeds smoothly compared with water-splitting without sacrificial agents, thus providing a convenient method to generate H2. The first study on sacrificial hydrogen production was reported by Kawai and Sakata in 1980 [7]. They succeeded in evolving H2 from sugar and carboxylic acids in photocatalytic reactions over RuO2/Pt/TiO2 [7] and Pt/TiO2 [8,9], respectively. With this back ground, various kinds of reviews have been published. For example, water-splitting over TiO2-based photocatalysts without sacrificial agents was reviewed by Ni et al. in 2007 [10]. Fornasiero et al. reviewed the photo-reforming of biomass-derived sacrificial agents over metal oxides in 2011 [11]. Moreover, Puga reviewed sacrificial photocatalytic H2 production from biomass-derived materials from the viewpoint of the development of the photocatalyst in 2016 [12]. This paper reviews sacrificial H2 production from polyols, carboxylic acids, and saccharides, focusing on the chemical yields of H2 production."
1,Titanium oxide-based photocatalysts,"The electrolysis of water proceeds theoretically by the application of 1.23V of voltage. Since water splitting is a two-electron process, 237.14kJmol−1 of energy is required [13]. TiO2 can absorb a light at 384nm which corresponds to 308.5kJmol−1 of excitation energy and exceeds the required energy. For photocatalytic reaction, almost all research has used TiO2 in the form of P25 (Degussa Co. Ltd, Germany) and ST01 (Ishihara Sangyo Co. Ltd., Japan). P25 is prepared by hydrolysis of TiCl4 and comprises 75% anatase and 25% rutile, whereas ST01 is prepared by hydrolysis of TiOSO4 and comprises 100% anatase [14]. There are several methods to enlarge the surface area of TiO2. For example, PEG (polyethylene glycol) was used as a pore-forming reagent to prepare porous TiO2 [15]. Silica gel (SiO2) supported TiO2 was used to prepare a TiO2-SiO2 composite by mixing Ti(OPri)4 with silica gel and then calcining [16]. In order to enhance the photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution, a Pt-loaded TiO2 (Pt/TiO2) was used. A photo-deposition method developed by Kennedy III and Datye is the most popular method, which is performed by irradiating an aqueous slurry of TiO2 in the presence of H2PtCl4 and ethanol [17]. Many researchers have used Pt/TiO2 for sacrificial H2 production [18–24]. Other noble metals such as Pd [25], Au [26,27], and Au-MOx (M = Ag, Cu, Ni) [28] have been loaded onto TiO2. Among the noble metal-loaded TiO2 photocatalysts (1% Ag, 1% Au, 1% Pt, and 0.5% Pt), Pt/TiO2 (Pt = 1wt%) was the most active for H2 production [29]. Other metals such as Cu [30], Ir, Ru, Rh, Ni [18], NiO [31,32], and RuO2 [33] have also been loaded onto TiO2. Kang et al. [34], Sun et al. [35], and Bandara et al. [36] succeeded in enhancing the reactivity of TiO2 by the deposition of CuO instead of Pt. Fluorinated Pt/TiO2 was prepared by flame spray pyrolysis of a precursor solution containing Ti(OPri)4, propanoic acid, K2PtCl6 and C6F6 [37]. Table 1 summarizes the results of sacrificial hydrogen production over the TiO2–based photocatalysts reported so far."
2,Alcoholic sacrificial agents (1),"Some typical alcoholic sacrificial agents are listed in Table 2. Early work on sacrificial H2 production was performed in neat alcohols such as methanol (1a), ethanol (1b) and 2-propanol (1d) [38,39]. Now, most sacrificial H2 production is performed in aqueous alcoholic solution. Aqueous solutions of 1a are the most typical sacrificial agents used to evaluate and optimize photocatalytic activity. 1a underwent oxidation up to CO2 through the formation of formaldehyde and formic acid along with the formation of H2 [19,40]. Kondarides et al. reported that the molar ratio of H2 to CO2 obtained from 1a was experimentally confirmed to be 3:1 [41]. The decomposition mechanism of 1a over Pt/TiO2 was discussed on the basis of a direct interaction of 1a with free or trapped holes in the TiO2 [42], or via attack of the HO·radical produced by the oxidation of the hydroxyl group by hole [43]. From product analysis using D2O, Selli et al. have elucidated that oxidation of 1a occurs indirectly through oxidation by the HO· radical at low concentration of 1a, and directly by oxidation through hole transfer from the TiO2 at higher concentrations of 1a [44]. Currently, initiation by hole transfer to water is responsible for the mechanism of decomposition of 1a over Pt/TiO2 [19]. In 1999, Bowker et al. proposed the decomposition mechanism of 1a over Pd/TiO2, where the decomposition of methanol was initiated by dissociation to CO and H2 on Pd and CO was oxidized into CO2 by O- generated by photo-excitation of TiO2 [18,22,25]. Moreover, photocatalytic steam reforming of 1a was reported over noble metal-loaded TiO2 [29,44]. Sacrificial H2 production has been applied to other alcoholic sacrificial agents such as 1b [45–48], 1-propanol (1c) [38], 1d [49,50], 2-butanol (1f) [51], and 1,2-ethanediol (1g) [52,53]. In particular, glycerol (1h) received much attention as a sacrificial agent because it was found that H2 evolution had a high yield and was highly efficient. In 2008, Kondarides et al. reported sacrificial H2 production from 1h over Pt/TiO2 (0.1–0.5wt%) [54]. They proposed that the decomposition of 1h proceeded through the formation of methanol and acetic acid which were eventually decomposed into CO2 and H2 in a ratio of 3:7 [55]. They also performed photo-oxidation and photo-reforming of 1h over Pt/TiO2 in the presence of O2 [56]. H2O2 was formed by a coupling reaction with HO· which was generated by oxidation of the hydroxyl group by hole. Another formation route of H2O2 was reduction of O2 generated by the photocatalytic reaction. They reported that the formation of H2O2 increased in the presence of 1h [57]. Bowker et al. examined the photocatalytic reforming of 1h over M/TiO2 (M = 0.5wt% Pd, 2.0wt% Au) [58]. Slamet et al. have prepared nanotube-type Pt–N/TiO2 (1wt% Pt) which was applied to sacrificial H2 production with 1h whose quantum yield for H2 evolution reached 0.37–0.36 [59]. Decomposition of 1h was initiated by hydrogen atom abstraction from the terminal CH2OH group by HO·. Yu et al. have reported that CuO/TiO2 (1.3wt% of CuO) was used for sacrificial H2 production with 1h [60]. Heteroatom (B, N)-doped Pt/TiO2 catalyst produced H2 in 88.7–90.9% yields from 1h under xenon-lamp-irradiation [61]. The B, N-doped Pt/TiO2 had absorption in visible light region (400−500nm). Practical application to H2 production from residual 1h obtained from biodiesel synthesis was reported [62,63]. As other type of sacrificial agents, Ohtani et al. converted lysine to pipecolinic acid along with the formation of H2 by photocatalytic reaction over Pt/TiO2 [64]. Sacrificial H2 production from ammonia over Pt/TiO2 produced H2 and N2 in 3:1M ratio [65]. Under acidic conditions, H2 evolution was suppressed due to the formation of ammonium ion. Methylamine and dimethylamine were decomposed by HO·radical generated by irradiation of TiO2 under an aerated atmosphere [66]: the amino groups were mainly converted to NH4 +. Sacrificial H2 production from aqueous solution of triethanolamine, diethanolamine, and ethanolamine over Pt/TiO2 were studied [67]. Chung et al. [68], Bowker et al. [22], and White et al. [69] reported water gas shift reaction from CO and H2O to H2 and CO2 over Pt/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2."
3,Chemical yields of hydrogen production from 1,"Idriss et al. examined sacrificial H2 production over M/TiO2 (M= Rh, Pd, Pt) to compare the rate of H2 production between neat alcohols (1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, and butanol) which was dependent on the solvent polarity [70]. Recently, they reported a structural dependence of the reactivity of aqueous alcoholic solution over M/TiO2 (M= Pd, Pt, Au) [71,72]. The H2 production rates decreased in the order 1h > 1g > 1,2-propandiol (1n) > 1a >> 1b > 1d > tert-butyl alcohol >> water, depending on the alcohol polarity and oxidation potentials. Bowker et al. also compared the reactivity of alcoholic sacrificial agent such as monools (1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 1f, tert-butyl alcohol) and polyols (1g and 1h) over M/TiO2 (M= Pd, Pt, Au) [73–75]. Leung et al. examined the structural effect of sacrificial agents using C3-polyols such as 1d, 1n, and 1h over Pt/TiO2 [76]. The alcohols that had more OH groups exhibited higher H2 evolution rates. Davies et al. examined the effect of the molecular structure of polyols on the rate of H2 evolution over Pd/TiO2 [77]. In this case, methane was detected in sacrificial H2 production from 1b, 1d, 1f, and 2,3-butanediol (1o) over Pd/TiO2 under UV irradiation. In 2013, Yasuda et al. discussed the structural effect of sacrificial agents based on the chemical yields of H2 production determined according to the following method [51]. The Pt/TiO2 (100mg, 2wt% Pt) was suspended in an aqueous solution (150ml) of 1 (0.25–1.25mmol). After O2 was purged from the reaction vessel using N2 gas, UV-irradiation was performed under vigorous stirring until gas evolution had ceased. The limiting quantity of H2 (H 2 max) obtained from one mole of the sacrificial agent with an infinite amount of the catalyst was determined from the intercept of the plots of molar ratio of H to sacrificial agent (H2/sacrificial agent) against the molar ratio of sacrificial agent to the catalyst (sacrificial agent/catalyst). The limiting quantity of CO2 (CO 2 max) obtained from one mole of the sacrificial agent at an infinite amount of the catalyst was also determined from the plots of CO2/sacrificial agent against sacrificial agent/catalyst. An example of the plots is shown in Fig. 1. If sacrificial agents (1, CnHmOp) is entirely decomposed into CO2 and H2O by HO· radicals, 2n–p + 0.5m equivalents (P) of H2 will be evolved in the TiO2-photocatalytic reaction Eq. (1). The P values are listed in Table 2. Therefore, the chemical yield of H2 production was defined to be 100 H 2 max/P. In the case of H2 production along with methane, the chemical yield was defined to be 100(H 2 max + 4CH 4 max)/P. (1) C n H m O p + 2 n − p H 2 O → n CO 2 + 2 n − p + 0.5 m H 2 In the cases of 1g, 1h, 1,2,3,4-butanetetrol (erythritol, 1i), and 1,2,3,4,5-pentanepentol (arabitol, 1j) which have oxygen atoms at all of the carbon, their H 2 max nearly equaled the P values. CO 2 max values were also close to the theoretical values, showing that the sacrificial agents were completely decomposed into CO2 and water by the photocatalytic reaction. In order to elucidate the relationship between structure and CO 2 max, alkanepolyols such as 1,2,3-butanetriol (1k), 1,2,4-butanetriol (1l), 1,2-butanediol (1m), 1n, 2,3-butanediol (1o), 1,3-propanediol (1p), 1,4-butanediol (1q), 1,3-propanediol (1r), and 2-butanol (1f) were used for sacrificial H2 production. Though considerable amounts of CO2 were evolved from 1k–1o, the CO 2 max (1.2–1.8) did not reach the theoretical values. The CO 2 max of inner continuous diols (1o) and the discontinuous diols (1p–1r) were small (0.4–0.5). Moreover, CO2 did not evolve from mono-ols such as 1f at all. Thus, in the case of these polyols, which have one or two non-hydroxy- substituted carbons, the H 2 max and CO 2 max values did not reach the theoretical values, resulting in no complete decomposition into CO2 and H2O. In sacrificial H2 production from aqueous solutions of amines, the chemical yield of H2 reached almost 100% in the cases of 1,2-diaminoethane, 2-aminoethanol, 2-amino-1,3-propandiol, and 3-amino-1,2-propandiol which have hetero-atom (N and O) at all of the carbon [78]."
4,Decarboxylation of carboxylic acids (2),"The degradation of alcoholic sacrificial agents proceeded through hydrogen-atom abstraction by HO· radical from the hydroxylated methylene and methine groups Eq. (2) and the aldehyde Eq. (3) [51]. Therefore, alcoholic sacrificial agents are decomposed through the formation of carboxylic acid. Many researchers proposed that the decomposition of carboxylic acids is initiated by hole transfer to the carboxylic group rather than H-abstraction by HO· radicals [49,59,79,80]. The CO2 evolution proceeds through a “photo-Kolbe”–type decarboxylation via carboxyl radicals (RCO2·; Eq. (4)). Lu et al. reported the degradation of formic acid (2a) and oxalic acid (2b) which can adsorb on Pt/TiO2 to give one equivalent H2 under irradiation [81,82]. 2a was the most degradable sacrificial agent which was decomposed to CO2 in a single step. Zielinska et al. used 2a as a sacrificial agent to evaluate the photocatalytic reactivity of strontium titanate (SrTiO3) [83]. The reaction intermediate produced during photocatalytic H2 production from glycolic acid (2c) was analyzed by infrared spectroscopy by Lin et al. [84]. Absorption due to HCO2 and CH3O on TiO2 were observed at 1356, 1540, 2874, 2955cm−1 and 2835, 2930cm−1, respectively, indicating the decarboxylation of 2c. Decomposition of 2c adsorbed on TiO2 proceeded through the formation of dioxymethylene (−OCH2O−). Mozia et al. reported that acetic acid (2d) was decomposed into H2, CO2, and CH4 over TiO2 without Pt [85], although Zheng et al. reported that a trace amounts of CH4 was detected from 2d over Pt/TiO2 (Pt = 1.0wt%) [86]. Sacrificial H2 production was applied to the treatment of organic pollutants such as ClCH2CO2H and Cl2CHCO2H [87]. (2) Image 1 (3) Image 2 (4) Image 3 Yasuda et al. determined the limiting chemical yields of H2 from carboxylic acids such as 2a, 2b, and 2c, which have oxygen atoms at all of the carbon [78]. They were decomposed quantitatively into H2 and CO2 since their H 2 max nearly equaled the P values. In the cases of 2d, lactic acid (2e), pyruvic acid (2f), malonic acid (2g) and propanoic acid, all carbons did not convert into CO2, but rather converted partially into methane, resulting in lower H 2 max values compared with the P values. The decomposition of propanoic acid (2h) was inefficient [78]. Thus, these results showed that the presence of the hydroxy group on the α-position of the carboxylic acid intermediates is required for efficient decarboxylation ( Scheme 2)."
5,Saccharides and related compounds (3),"Ascorbic acid (3a) [88], glucose (3e) [61,89–92], xylose (3i) [93], fructose (3i) [91], and sucrose (3j) [61] were subjected to sacrificial H2 generation over Pt/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 under UV irradiation. According to the method described for polyols (Section 4), the chemical yields were determined for H2 production from sacrificial agents including pyranoses such as 3e, galactose (3f), mannose (3g), sorbose (3h), and fructose (3i), and disaccharides such as 3j and cellobiose (3k) as well as related compounds such as ascorbic acid (3a), sugar alcohols such as xylitol (3b) and sorbitol (3c) and gluconic acid (3d) ( Scheme 3) [63]. The yields were nearly 100% in the case of 3a–3k, as shown in Table 1. Since all saccharides have oxygen atom at all of the carbons, the saccharides continued to serve as electron sources until their sacrificial ability was exhausted. The quantum yields (Φ) was precisely determined to be 0.057 for photocatalytic H2 production from 1b (0.434M) using Pt/TiO2 (Pt content 1.0wt%) at pH 10.0 by de Lasa et al. [47]. Using this value as actinometer, Yasuda et al. determined Φ at various concentrations of saccharides (3, 8–40mM) to determine the limiting quantum yields (Φ ∞) at an infinite concentration of 3 [94]. Scheme 4 was postulated as the reaction mechanism for photocatalytic H2 generation. Here, k R and k D are the rate constants for hydrogen atom abstraction from 3 by the HO· radical and the recombination of electrons with HO· radicals, respectively. Eq. (5) can be derived from Scheme 4 and was modified by inverse calculation of both members of equation to give Eq. (6). In double reciprocal plots of Φ vs [3] ( Fig. 2), the inverse of the intercept of the plots was equated to αβ (= Φ ∞) which was determined to be 0.058–0.201 for 3a–3k, as shown in Table 1. (5) Φ = a β k R [ 3 ] k D + k R [ 3 ] (6) 1 Φ = 1 α β ( 1 + k D k R [ 3 ] )"
6,Hydrogen production from lignocelluloses through enzymatic hydrolysis and photocatalytic reaction,"Plants collect sunlight energy through photosynthesis and store it as a variety of polymeric saccharides. Polymeric saccharides are easily converted into monomeric saccharides, which are then used for energy in all living organisms. Thus, saccharides are energy-storage substances which have great potential as resources to construct renewable energy systems as alternatives to petroleum-based fuels. Bio-ethanol production is a typical method to produce liquid fuel from a variety of biomasses such as starch, lignocellulose, and algae through glucose-fermentation [95]. However, the ethanol concentration is usually too low (<50gL−1) to separate it by distillation with low energy costs [96,97]. On the other hand, gaseous H2 can be spontaneously isolated from reaction mixture without requiring a dedicated separation operation. Therefore, hydrogen production from saccharides derived from biomass is an economical approach to biofuel production [98]. In a recent review published by Shimura and Yoshida in 2011, sacrificial H2 production from biomass derivatives was compared with other catalytic reforming, showing the advantage of the photocatalytic process [99]. Cellulosic materials are widely recognized as being promising sustainable sources for bio-ethanol, since they are not directly in competition with food sources [100]. Thermal catalytic H2 production from lignocelluloses was reviewed by Beltramini et al. [101]. Recently sacrificial H2 production (PR) was combined with biological treatment in order to convert lignocelluloses to H2. Enzymatic saccharification (SA) of lignocelluloses by cellulases from Acremonium cellulolyticus, Trichoderma viride, and Aspergillus niger under acidic conditions (pH 5.0) gave glucose and xylose Eq. (7). Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) using cellulases and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) gave ethanol and xylose Eq. (8). Glucose and xylose can be converted into H2 through PR over Pt/TiO2 Eq. (9). Yasuda et al. applied these processes to the production of bio-fuels from Italian ryegrass, Napier grass, bamboo, rice straw, and silvergrass, resulting in the formation of H2 and/or ethanol [102–104]. In general, lignocelluloses had to be subjected to pretreatment process to remove lignin and promote enzymatic digestibility of the cellulosic components. To do this, alkali–pretreatment or low-moisture anhydrous ammonia (LMAA) pretreatment using ammonia were applied. Plants can produce glucose from CO2 and H2O under irradiation from sunlight Eq. (10). Glucose with combustion energy of 2803kJmol−1 can theoretically be converted into 12 equivalents of H2 with total combustion energy of 3430kJ Eq. (11) [105,106]. The total energy recovery efficiencies (E ff) in the conversion of lignocelluloses to bio-fuels (ethanol and H2) are summarized in Table 3. Since the PR process proceeded with high efficiency, the E ff values were mainly dependent on the biological processes. Practical photocatalytic reforming of hydrolyzed products of lignocelluloses, lipids, and Chlorella was reported [107].

7,Conclusion and perspectives,"We elucidated the fact that sacrificial agents having oxygen atoms at all of the carbon can continue to serve as an electron source until their sacrificial ability is exhausted [52]. Since almost all biomass-derived materials belong to this type of sacrificial agent, biomass reforming through sacrificial H2 production over Pt/TiO2 will provide new ways to produce renewable and sustainable energy. Recent trends are shifting to the development of solar-light responsive photocatalysts. Solar water splitting was reviewed by Ahmad et al. in 2015 [108]. Kondarides et al. photo-reformed 1h over CuOx/TiO2 (Cu= 0.01–2.8wt%) under visible light irradiation [109]. H2 production over a CuO-TiO2 composite was performed by Pai et al. using 1a and 1h under sun-light irradiation [110]. Cu2O/TiO2 [111–113] and NiTiO2 [114] were designed for visible-light driven photocatalyst in sacrificial H2 production from 1a, 1b, 1g and 1h. CdS/Pt/TiO2 [115] and Cu/S-TiO2 [116] were applied to sacrificial H2 production from lactic acid under visible light irradiation. TiO2, which has a rather wide-band gap was coupled with a narrow-band-gap semiconductor (SiC) to prepare multi-composite catalysts such as IrO2/SiC-NiO/TiO2 [117] and S-TiO2-SiC [118]. SrTiO3-TiO2 was applied in sacrificial H2 production from 1g under visible light irradiation [119]. Anpo et al. prepared a thin film of TiO2 which operate as photocatalyst at > 450nm for sacrificial H2 production from methanol [120]. The practical use of sacrificial H2 evolution is accomplished by a use of solar radiation. H2 evolution over Cu/TiO2 [121], Pt/TiO2 [122], and Au/TiO2 [123] using formic acid and formaldehyde were developed under solar irradiation. If H2 is produced by a photocatalytic process using solar energy and sacrificial agents supplied by biomass, it will be a most promising sustainable energy source."
