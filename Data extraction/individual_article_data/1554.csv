0,Introduction,"Chemical research has been an important contributor to our societal progress. The future of this progress depends on harnessing the potential of chemical research to address crucial sustainability issues like resource depletion, global warming and affordable access to renewable resources. Hence it is imperative to supplement laboratory research with metrics which enable incorporation of sustainability aspects in chemical process development, i.e. at early stage. Anastas’ Twelve Principles of Green Chemistry [1] were a milestone in this respect and since then, there have been some developments toward quantitative operationalization of these principles [2,3]. The renewability of feedstocks is one of the core characteristics of a sustainable chemical process. Hence there has been increased research interest in the development of new routes to produce chemicals and fuels from biobased resources [4]. Continuing research and development efforts in this direction have resulted in the commercialization of renewables based chemical processes for production of ethanol, ethene, propylene glycol, butanol [5] among others. The production of these chemicals and fuels from biobased resources has been shown to offer environmental benefits like lower greenhouse gas emissions and non-renewable energy use [6–9]. However, continued progress on this path hinges on the development of novel inherently sustainable chemical processes which are optimized across economic, environmental and social parameters. In the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the production of bioethanol [10] from first generation biobased feedstocks like corn and sugarcane. For the medium to long term, the production from lignocellulosic resources offers a potentially more sustainable [11] and reliable supply of bioethanol. With these feedstock and chemical process developments, bioethanol is emerging as one of the key building blocks for production of renewable chemicals. This has led to identification of several conventionally produced chemicals for which production from bioethanol is an attractive alternative [12]. One such potentially interesting family of products is Guerbet alcohols which are widely used in the chemical industry for applications like cosmetics, chemical intermediates, lubricants and solvents [13,14]. The process of producing higher alcohols from ethanol via Guerbet reaction has already been known for over a century [15]. It is generally accepted that the Guerbet reaction is a sequence of different reactions starting from dehydrogenation of alcohol, followed by aldol condensation, dehydration and finally hydrogenation of the unsaturated aldehyde (Fig. 1 ). However, there have also been studies that claim a direct condensation of starting alcohol without intermediate aldol condensation step [16]. Depending on the starting alcohols the Guerbet alcohols are either linear or branched primary alcohols. One of the most widely known Guerbet alcohols is 2-ethyl-1-hexanol (2-EH) which is used primarily for the production of plasticizers (dioctylphthalate) and has a global market volume of 2.5 million metric tonne per year [17]. Industrially, homogeneous catalysts are applied to convert starting alcohols containing usually more than 6 carbon atoms toward Guerbet alcohols. Usually corrosive bases such as potassium hydroxide with or without the presence of a soluble metal complex are used. The water produced is continuously removed by the addition of a desiccant like CaO [18–22]. Apart from reliance on conventional fossil feedstocks, one other disadvantage of this approach is the corrosive nature of soluble bases used. This leads to high initial capital costs and high amounts of spent catalyst per tonne of product leading to increased requirements for wastewater treatment. Consequently 30% of the selling price is product purification and waste treatment [23]. Hence a potential solution, which is the target of current research, is to perform this reaction in gas phase utilizing a heterogeneous catalyst and bioethanol as starting alcohol. There are several examples in the literature that utilize heterogeneous catalysts, mainly for the Guerbet conversion of ethanol to 1-butanol. Catalysts used are mainly MgO, MgAl mixed oxides and hydroxyapatites. A good review of applied heterogeneous catalysts for ethanol condensation toward 1-butanol is given by Kozlowski [24]. In our research we used alkaline earth metal oxide nanoparticles of different base strength supported on carbon nano-fibers (CNF) as catalysts. CNF have a relatively high surface area (∼150m2 g−1) and are inert and therefore suitable as catalyst support under demanding conditions. Simple base oxides are capable of, next to performing the aldol reaction, conducting dehydrogenation/hydrogenation reactions (first and last step of Guerbet reaction, see Fig. 1). For the latter steps often high temperatures are required with these catalysts rendering the catalytic system less sustainable in terms of energy consumption [25]. A possible solution to decrease the amount of energy required, i.e. by lowering the reaction temperature is to add a metal function to the basic oxide as metals are far more efficient dehydrogenation/hydrogenation catalysts [26]. More elaborate information on the current state of the art on heterogeneously catalyzed Guerbet reaction has been included in Appendix D1 [23,24,27–42]. In this article we use 2-ethyl-1-hexanol (2-EH) as a representative compound for higher Guerbet alcohols and report the application of different sustainability metrics in parallel with catalyst developments. We highlight the laboratory developments alongside stepwise sustainability analysis at different stages. Thus, we present the advances in catalytic research and also analyze the accuracy of the early-stage sustainability assessment method and explore how it could be improved. Accordingly the following facets are covered in this study: (1) Laboratory developments for Guerbet alcohols. (2) Primary early-stage sustainability assessment (primary ESA) at the onset of laboratory research. (3) Detailed analysis based on process design, techno-economic (TE) analysis and life cycle assessment (LCA) for 2-EH as an example for Guerbet alcohols. (4) Updated early-stage sustainability assessment (updated ESA) based on new insights gained in process design. An important aim of this research is to bring together quantitative sustainability assessment methods and laboratory research to enable effective development of sustainable chemical processes. Using very early stage information and results at the onset of this chemical research, sustainability assessments for nine processes were performed [43] based on the methodology reported in Patel et al. [2]. One of these early-stage analyses was based on a one reactor approach for the production of 2-EH from ethanol and helped to highlight the potential benefits and drawbacks of this process. The assessment indicated that a biobased process would be potentially favorable. Following this first assessment, we present in this paper a more detailed analysis that was performed with techno-economic (TE) analysis and life cycle assessment (LCA), based on a conceptual process simulation model. In the course of process model development it was found that instead of one reactor, a scheme involving four reactors is more feasible for this process which was therefore the basis for the simulation model (including economic assessment and LCA). Considering the change in lay-out, a new early-stage analysis according to Patel et al. [2] was performed for a four-stage reactor configuration which relied on the new insights gained during detailed assessment. We then investigate the conformity of results obtained from the different early stage analyses and the detailed analysis. This has enabled us to identify the suitability of early stage analysis, pinpoint the sources of differences in the outcomes compared to detailed analysis and provide guidance for future assessments. This study highlights the learning realized by making use of the results of the experimental research for assessment activities which, in turn, allowed to take informed decisions for the next round of expertiments. This learning is demonstrated by the progress in the catalyst development and assessment approaches. Thus in this article we present the results for laboratory developments, two variants of early stage assessment and for prospective techno-economic and life cycle assessment for the production of 2-EH."
1,Materials and methods,This study involves a combination of laboratory experiments and analytical models. In this section we present the methods and key assumptions that underpin each of the four facets of this study as listed earlier in the introduction. Appendix A lists some of the key data inputs common across all the facets of this study.
2,Laboratory developments for Guerbet alcohols,"2.1 Laboratory developments for Guerbet alcohols 2.1.1 Materials and reagents All reagents were used as received. Magnesium nitrate hexahydrate, 99+%, for analysis and copper(II) nitrate trihydrate, 99%, pro-analysis were acquired from Acros. Barium nitrate, ACS reagent, ≥99%, was acquired from Sigma–Aldrich. Oxidized CNF (oxidizing agent HNO3) was used as support and was prepared as described elsewhere using Ni/SiO2 as growth catalyst [44–46]. 2.1.2 Catalyst preparation Supported base (alkaline earth) catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using aqueous solutions of the corresponding nitrates on oxidized CNF (425–212μm). All samples contained the same molar metaloxide loading (1.5mol%). After impregnation the samples were dried under dynamic vacuum at RT and stored under inert atmosphere. Cu-MgO/CNF was prepared by co-impregnation of an aqueous solution of Mg-nitrate and Cu-nitrate. The MgO (MgO 1.5mol%) to Cu ratio was varied from 10 to 30 thereby resulting in different weight percentage of copper (0.27, 0.41 and 0.82). A sample containing only copper (Cu/CNF, 0.82 weight percentage of copper) was also synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation using copper nitrate. The alkaline earth metal oxides (AEMO) were activated at 600°C (ramp 5°Cmin−1, dwell 3h) in N2 (30mlmin−1). In case Cu was present this treatment was followed by a reduction step (350°C, ramp 5°Cmin−1, dwell 5h) in N2/H2 (2/1, 30mlmin−1). After activation the catalysts were stored under inert atmosphere before further use. In case Cu/CNF was synthesized without the presence of base, this catalyst was directly reduced without prior activation step (350°C, ramp 5°Cmin−1, dwell 5h in N2/H2 (2/1, 30mlmin−1)). 2.1.3 Characterization techniques applied The crystallinity and particle size of the catalysts were characterized using a Bruker D8 Advance XRD with Co Kα radiation (λ =1.789Å). The basicity of the samples assessed using CO2 chemisorption was performed on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 V4.00 system. The samples, previously activated at 600°C under nitrogen for 3h were loaded in the reactor in a glove box. CO2 adsorption measurements were performed at 0°C. Adsorption isotherms were obtained by plotting CO2 uptake versus absolute pressure. By extrapolating the linear part of the isotherm to zero bar pressure the total number of basic sites was determined. N2 physiosorption measurements were carried out using a Micromeretics TriStar 3000 V6.08 A system at −196°C to determine BET surface area and pore volume (p/p 0 =0.96). TEM analysis of the samples was performed with an FEI Tecnai 12 an FEI Technai 20 F. The samples were placed on a holy carbon grid, and both bright field and dark field TEM images were recorded. Characterization results are provided in Appendix D1. 2.1.4 Catalyst testing The catalysts were tested for the Guerbet reaction starting from ethanol (T =300°C, using 200mg of catalyst weighed under inert atmosphere). A plug flow quartz reactor with a 4mm i.d. was used. Before testing the catalyst was heated to the reaction temperature in inert atmosphere (N2) and kept at that temperature under static conditions for 5h. In parallel the ethanol and propane (internal standard) flow was adjusted and stabilized. Subsequently that stabilized mixture was introduced to the reactor. Ethanol was supplied by means of a HPLC pump (9μlmin−1) into a flow of 30 (mlmin−1) N2 (containing 1.67mol% propane as internal standard) through heat traced stainless steel tubing kept at 177°C. This results in an 11vol% ethanol feed stream. Contact time in ethanol was 5.6s or 2h−1 WHSV. For the test with a physical mixture 0.5g MgO/CNF and 0.2g Cu/CNF were used (activated as described above for Cu-MgO/CNF). The reaction using this physical mixture was conducted at 200°C with a contact time in ethanol of 18.3s while the other conditions were the same as mentioned above. The physical mixture was compared to MgO/CNF also tested at 200°C and a contact time in ethanol of 18.3s. The conversion is calculated based on the GC areas of ethanol (A ethanol,in) and the internal standard propane (A propane,in) determined before the reaction and area of ethanol and internal standard during the reaction (A ethanol,out, A propane,out): (1) Conv ( % ) = ( A ethanol , in / A propane , in ) − ( A ethanol , out / A propane , out ) A ethanol , in / A propane , in Selectivities are defined as the GC area of the product ‘i’ as a fraction of the total GC area of all products that are formed. (2) Sel ( % ) = A i ∑ i = 0 n A n × 100 % Productivity is defined as: (3) Productivity = Ethanol in ( mmol / h ) × Conv ( % ) × Sel ( % ) g catalyst"
3,Primary early stage sustainability assessment (primary ESA),"2.2 Primary early stage sustainability assessment (primary ESA) The Primary early-stage sustainability assessment (primary ESA) was based on the methodology reported in Patel et al. [2] which makes use of information from laboratory research like reaction yields, concentrations and reaction temperature. The methodology compares the performance of a novel chemical process with a conventional process as a reference. In this paper, only the environmental and economic aspects of this methodology (pillars 1–3 2 2 Refers to the 5 pillars (indicators) as described in the methodology article. ) have been used to ensure a fair comparison with TE and LCA based detailed assessments. The categories and respective weighing factors (numbers associated with arrows) used for the purpose of this analysis are represented in Fig. 2 . Consequently the economic aspects and environmental impacts have an effective weighting factor of 0.55 and 0.45 respectively in the integrated total score. As the indicators used are impacts, the lowest possible total score is aimed for. The sustainability index ratio (SIR) is the ratio of the total score of the biobased process to that of the fossil based process. Thus a SIR of less than ‘1’ indicates that the biobased process is more favorable. Please refer to Appendix B for more information regarding the reasoning behind the weights and calculations based on this methodology. The primary ESA was performed at the onset of the project based on the limited information for the biobased process available from laboratory experiments and assumptions at that time. This primary assessment which is based on a one-reactor approach has been reported under a different set of assumptions and data inputs in Patel et al. [2]. Based on the methodology, the early stage assessment analyzes a potential future process case with a one reactor system and a potentially ideal separation system 3 3 A separation system which completely separates out the unreacted raw materials for recycle, the products, the co-products and the waste stream. which would lead to the final 2-EH product. It is envisioned that all the unreacted raw materials and the intermediate alcohols and aldehydes are recycled back to the reactor for further conversion to higher alcohols. Fig. 3 gives a schematic of the process configuration which formed the basis of the assessment. The relevant assumptions and mass balance data which form the basis of this assessment can be found in Appendix C. Appendix also includes a description of the reference conventional fossil based process for production of 2-EH."
4,Detailed analysis,"2.3 Detailed analysis 2.3.1 Analysis methodology For the purpose of in-depth assessment, a process simulation model was developed for a prospective 2-EH production process from ethanol. This simulation was developed using ASPEN Plus process engineering software [47]. Pinch analysis [48] was used to estimate the optimal heat integration potential for this process design. The unit operations, for which it was impossible or impractical to implement heat integration in practice (e.g. temperature difference less than 10K, cooling of compressors) have been excluded from the Pinch analysis. The process has been modeled and sized to convert 375,000 metric tonnes of bioethanol into 213,000 metric tonnes of 2-EH per year while operating for 8400h per year. The processing capacity is based approximately on the expected output of Abengoa bioethanol production plant in Rotterdam [49]. The mass and energy balance simulation formed the basis of TE assessment. The economic feasibility assessment was based on equipment price data from the SCENT tool [50] and raw material price data from various sources [51–55]. The year of reference for the economic analysis is 2011. Hence, the chemical market prices used in this study refer to June 2011. A discounted cash flow analysis was performed following the methodology of NREL [56] to arrive at a minimum viable product price at a fixed 10% internal rate of return and a zero net present value. The ratio of this minimum viable price and the market price of 2-EH produced from fossil resources is used an indicator for economic viability of the production process from ethanol. The mass and energy balances from the process simulation model also form the basis of LCA model for the biobased process. The LCA models for the biobased and the fossil based routes were prepared using SIMAPRO software [57] and is based on data from the Ecoinvent v2 database [57] and other literature sources [9,58,59]. The geographical scope for the production is a potential plant in the Rotterdam area of the Netherlands. This is used as a reference for location specific data like the electricity and natural gas supply mix. A natural gas based combined heat and power (CHP) unit with an overall efficiency of 72% and an electricity factor (EF) of 0.613 4 4 The heat output of the CHP unit is {(1/(1+EF))×input energy×overall efficiency} and the remaining useful output is electricity. [60] is assumed to provide the steam and electricity requirements for both the biobased and conventional fossil based processes. It is also assumed that at the end of life, the energy contained in the product is recovered via waste incineration with an overall efficiency of 33% (11% as electricity and 22% as heat) based on lower heating value of the product [61]. Since the bio-based and the fossil based process lead to chemically identical products, the use phase 5 5 Use phase includes the use of this chemical to further produce other chemicals which are transformed into products that are then used by the consumers and at the end of their useful life are discarded as waste. In this study we consider that this waste is incinerated thus leading to energy recovery and emissions at the end of life. is same for both the systems and hence is not considered for this comparative analysis. In contrast, end-of-life waste management has to be modeled due to the different origin of the carbon embodied in the final product (fossil versus bio-based). Figs. 4 and 5 show the system diagram for both the biobased and fossil based systems for 2-EH. Climate change contribution (equivalent kg CO2 units) based on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and cumulative energy demand (CED) are the two impact categories studied in the assessment. This choice was made to ensure consistency with the early stage assessment methodology and based on literature [62] information regarding the usefulness of these indicators. The calculation for climate change contribution is based on the IPCC GWP100 methodology [63] and the CED calculation is based on the methodology reported in Huijbregts et al. [62]. In line with the early stage assessment [2], we assume also for the detailed analysis that both the CED and GHG contribute equally to the environmental impact indicator. More specific information regarding the variety of data and assumptions used for economic analysis and life cycle assessment can be found in Appendix D section D3 and D4. It is acknowledged that more environmental impact categories would need to be taken into account for a complete environmental impact assessment (compare [64]). As reported in Tufvesson et al. [65], inclusion of other environmental impacts apart from CED and the contribution to climate change offers a more complete understanding about the impacts associated with the chemical process. However, this information should be included simultaneously in the early stage and detailed analysis in a consistent manner with appropriate indicators. Further studies are needed to pinpoint specific indicators and methods that will enable inclusion of such impacts without significantly increasing the data requirements for an early stage analysis. Similar to early stage assessment, a sustainability index ratio (SIR) was calculated for the in-depth assessment following the methodology described by Fig. 6 . The numbers associated with the arrows represent the weighting factors for economic and environmental impact categories, which are in-line with the weights of these categories for the early stage assessment. Before applying the weighting factors, each of the indicators (price ratio, GHG and CED) is normalized internally (divided by the maximum value for biobased and fossil based). This ensures unit-less numbers which can be weighted and added to yield a total score. SIR is the ratio of the total score for the biobased process and the fossil based process; the method applied is identical for the early stage assessment and the in-depth assessment, allowing direct comparability. 2.3.2 Process description The conversion of ethanol to 2-EH takes place via two Guerbet reactions. The first Guerbet reaction involves conversion of ethanol to 1-butanol which is subsequently converted to 2-EH in the second Guerbet reaction step (see Table 1 ). The Guerbet reaction takes place via dehydrogenation to aldehydes and hydro-condensation (involving aldol condensation, followed by dehydration and finally hydrogenation reactions to higher alcohols). Hence, contrary to the assumption of one single reactor according to the primary ESA (see Fig. 2), it was found that the Guerbet reaction should be preferably carried out in two reactors. The first reaction can be carried out in the gas phase in a dehydrogenation reactor operating at low pressure to shift equilibrium toward the formation of aldehydes and hydrogen. The second high pressure hydro-condensation reactor would favor the subsequent aldol condensation and hydrogenation reaction steps. To ensure lower by-product formation and higher yields in conversion of ethanol to 2-EH, we decided to use a four reactor configuration. In this configuration the first two reactors convert ethanol to 1-butanol and the subsequent two reactors convert purified 1-butanol to 2-EH (see Table 1). Section D2 in Appendix includes more information on the reasoning behind a four reactor approach. Fig. 7 shows the process flow diagram for the simulation. The process is divided into seven sections as indicated in the figure. It is assumed that the required utilities (electricity, heating, cooling and waste treatment) are purchased from outside the battery limits. The aim of the analysis is to assess a best case future scenario for this reaction scheme, hence high yields are assumed. Table 1 gives the conversions and selectivities for the various reactions modeled in the four reactors. Additional detailed description of the process model and assumptions can be found in Appendix D. 2.3.3 Updated early stage assessment (updated ESA) The assumption of only one reactor according to the primary ESA was modified once the detailed process design had been developed. Hence, an updated ESA was carried out based on the process model assumptions to study the change in results of ESA. This updated ESA was based on a four reactor configuration and is represented in Fig. 8 . The assumptions regarding the reactions are same as the ones for process model, while those for the separation sequence and subsequent evaluation are based on the methodology as described in the earlier section on primary ESA."
5,Results and discussion,In this section we first present the results from laboratory research on catalyst development. Thereafter we put these results into a broader perspective by providing findings and a discussion for each of the three sustainability assessment facets of this study. Subsequently the results from these three facets are compared to understand the applicability of the assessment methods and to identify the preferred approach offering practically usable and reliable metrics for process development at the laboratory stage.
6,Laboratory developments for Guerbet alcohols,"3.1 Laboratory developments for Guerbet alcohols Fig. 9 displays the selectivities obtained (conversion levels plotted in Fig. 10 ) over two catalysts after 1min (MgO and BaO) and 1h time on stream (MgO-1h and BaO-1h). These selectivities are obtained with similar mol% of MgO and BaO supported on CNF. In general, the main products obtained were ethanal and 1-butanol. Clearly the simple alkaline earth metal oxides alone are capable of catalyzing all the consecutive steps of Guerbet reaction including dehydrogenation/hydrogenation steps at 300°C. Fig. 9 also shows that increasing basicity of the corresponding alkaline earth metal oxides (BaO having higher basicity than MgO) leads to increased production of higher alcohols such as 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and 1-octanol in the case of BaO after 1min of reaction. In case of MgO after 1min of reaction time the highest alcohol obtained is 1-hexanol. After 1h of reaction time (bars MgO-1h and BaO-1h) the highest alcohol obtained with MgO was 1-butanol and in the case of BaO it was 1-hexanol. Fig. 10 displays the ethanol conversion as function of time over MgO and BaO catalysts whose selectivities are depicted in Fig. 9. Clearly both catalysts lost a significant part of their activity during the first hour time on stream, from around 30% ethanol conversion to 1% in case of MgO and 5% in case of BaO. Nevertheless BaO retains a low but significant activity (5%) after that. To increase the activity of supported alkaline earth metal oxides we added a metal (Cu) to MgO (MgO was chosen since it the best available and more sustainable alkaline earth metal oxide) as metals are much better dehydrogenation/hydrogenation catalysts than oxides [26]. Cu was chosen as dehydrogenation/hydrogenation catalyst based on our catalytic results (not shown) where Cu alone supported on CNF was highly selective toward ethanal production from ethanol. Fig. 11 shows selectivities obtained with different Cu/MgO/CNF (Mg/Cu=10, 20, 30 and pure MgO/CNF) catalysts after 1min time on stream. All catalysts contain the same mol% of MgO. Fig. 11 shows that adding a metal (Cu) by impregnation to MgO did not have a significant influence on the selectivity of the reaction. Also ethanol conversions were not affected by addition of Cu by impregnation (results not shown). Better results were obtained by using a physical mixture of copper and magnesium oxide, both supported on CNF. In this case the catalysts were tested at 200°C. The lower temperature was chosen based on the fact that fast deactivation of Cu alone supported on CNF during ethanol conversion at 300°C was observed. Initial conversion dropped in that case from 90% to less than 5% within 4h reaction time, ethanal being the main product formed. In addition, alkaline earth metal oxides supported on CNF are capable of conducting aldol reaction (one of the steps in the overall reaction scheme (Fig. 1) at even lower temperatures than 200°C. For example, propanone aldol condensation using alkaline earth metal oxides supported on CNF is conducted at a temperature of around 0°C [66]. In Fig. 12 selectivities obtained at a reaction temperature of 200°C and different reaction times (1 and 5h) are depicted for MgO/CNF and physical mixture (PM) of MgO/CNF and Cu/CNF (PM (MgO+Cu)) both supported separately on CNF. In this graph the conversions obtained are also displayed (secondary axis). MgO/CNF alone showed low conversion of only 1% due to its low dehydrogenation/hydrogenation abilities at this low temperature. Addition of Cu/CNF to MgO/CNF, thus making a physical mixture, greatly increased conversion of ethanol (Fig. 12). After 5h on stream the physical mixture of MgO/CNF and Cu/CNF showed an ethanol conversion of 12% while MgO/CNF was barely active at all. MgO/CNF was more selective toward 1-butanol than the physical mixture of MgO/CNF and Cu/CNF which showed the highest selectivity toward ethanal followed by 1-butanol. In case of the physical mixture also 1-hexanol was obtained which was not seen in case of MgO/CNF. Based on conversions and selectivity's obtained in Fig. 12, in case of physical mixture productivity of 1-butanol was around 8 times higher than if MgO/CNF alone was used at reaction temperatures of 200°C (0.74mmol1-butanol/hgcatalyst for PM (MgO+Cu) and 0.09mmol1-butanol/hgcatalyst for MgO/CNF at t =1h). Addition of copper, an effective dehydrogenation/hydrogenation catalysts confirms the notion that oxides, in this case alkaline earth metal oxides, are not efficient dehydrogenation/hydrogenation catalysts as they are efficient aldol condensation catalysts. Irrespective of the base strength of alkaline earth metal oxide (MgO vs BaO) or addition of a metal function (Cu) to the base catalyst, the main alcohol formed from ethanol was always 1-butanol. Thus, applying heterogeneous catalysis for the synthesis of 2-ethyl-1-hexanol based on literature study and own catalytic results at least two reactors are needed. In the first reactor ethanol is converted to 1-butanol and in the second reactor 1-butanol is converted to 2-ethyl-1-hexanol. However, based on process design, a four reactor approach would enable use of more selective catalysts in conditions favorable for the reactions, which can reduce the formation of by-products and lead to higher yields for specific higher alcohols like 2-ethyl-1-hexanol."
7,Primary early stage assessment,"3.2 Primary early stage assessment Fig. 13 shows the integrated result of the primary ESA. With a sustainability index ratio (SIR 6 6 Ratio of the total score of biobased process to that of the fossil based process. ) of 0.95, the figure shows that subject to relevant assumptions, the biobased process can be beneficial as compared to the fossil based process. The marginally higher economic benefits of the fossil based process are negated by the higher expected environmental impacts. Thus an ethanol based process which progressively cycles intermediates to higher alcohols in one single reactor can seem to be an attractive option. However, it is important to note that this outcome does not take into consideration viability of the assumptions regarding catalyst and process performance along with other uncertainties such as prices of commodities. Also contrary to the analysis reported in Patel et al. [2] this analysis does not take into account EHS (Environment, Health and Safety) aspects which would be important to consider when assessing a chemical process. This has been done to ensure consistency with the detailed analysis. To analyze EHS aspects, process simulation information about the conventional process would also be needed which is not available."
8,Detailed analysis,"3.3 Detailed analysis Table 2 shows the mass balance results of the process simulation model for the biobased process for production of 2-EH from ethanol. The overall modeled selectivity of ethanol to 2-EH is 80.5% on a carbon mole basis (i.e. 80.5% of the theoretical maximum). The majority of the mass losses occur in the two low pressure reactors along with some minor losses (1%) in the separation steps. Table 3 shows the total energy requirements for the process with and without heat integration. It can be observed that the heating and cooling requirements can be reduced by over 50% through heat exchange. Table 4 provides a summary of the economic analysis results for this process. The minimum viable price (MVP) for the biobased product is about 45% higher than the market price of 1.56 EUR/kg for fossil based 2-EH. Using an ethanol price of about 0.71EUR/kg in Brazil, the MVP for 2-EH at 2.08EUR/kg is still about 33% higher than the market price. The MVP of the biobased product is sensitive to the price of feedstock ethanol and hydrogen which contribute 65% of the total MVP. Also for the fossil product, based on estimations for early stage assessment, the feedstocks contribute to approximately 65% of the market price. In the absence of an increase in the price of fossil based product, the price of ethanol has to drop to about 0.43EUR/kg for the biobased product to achieve price parity. Following the NREL methodology for the analysis of process economics, 100% equity financing and modified accelerated cost recovery depreciation regime have been assumed. Instead, if 0% equity (and therefore loan financing at 8% interest rate for a 10 year time period) and straight line depreciation were chosen, then the results change only very marginally. The MVP of biobased product increases only by 2% (contribution of change in depreciation regime is only 0.06%) to 2.32EUR/kg. As the price for biobased product is still about 48% higher (compared to 45% before) than the fossil based product, this would hence not influence the final conclusion. It should be noted that these results refer to a best case biobased process performance which assumes significant developments in catalyst research for this process. Fig. 14 shows the results for the cumulative energy demand (CED) for the biobased and fossil based systems for 2-EH determined with the life cycle assessment model. In the figure the CED is shown as a sum of its two components, viz. renewable (REU) and non-renewable energy use (NREU). The biobased system has a higher CED as compared to the fossil based system. This is because the fossil based system starts from liquid crude oil as compared to solid biomass and also it has been optimized through decades of process chain improvements. However, the biobased system entails about 40% lower NREU thus helping to reduce dependence on non-renewable resources. The CED as a whole is a proxy for a variety of environmental impacts [62] and hence reduction of CED is an important objective for further development of a biobased process system. Fig. 15 shows the results for greenhouse gas emissions associated with the process systems. As can be observed the base case GHG emissions are about one-third lower for the biobased system compared to the fossil based system. The base case value will be used for the calculation of sustainability index ratio in the further course of this paper. A still debated, but potentially important aspect associated with biobased systems [67] is land use change. It entails that introduction of new biobased process systems leads to changes in conventional land use patterns (e.g. diversion of virgin forest or peat lands for agricultural use) which can lead to a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions. For the biomass system used in this study for ethanol production, the estimates for this increase range between 2 (low) and 25 (high)kg CO2/GJ ethanol [68]. Hence the graph below also shows the effect of this uncertainty on the base case GHG emission estimate for the biobased process system. Based on the above results for economic and environmental assessment, integrated results for the detailed analysis are shown in Fig. 16 . Contrary to the primary ESA we now observe a SIR of 1.23 which indicates that the biobased system is not preferable compared to the fossil based system. The fossil based system scores better on the economic aspects as well as the overall environmental impact, considering the lower cumulative energy demand. However, this integrated outcome is also heavily dependent on the price, CED and GHG emissions associated with the bioethanol feedstock. Ethanol production from different systems like Brazilian production or lignocellulosic resource based production could lead to a lower overall SIR of 1.01 and 0.78 respectively. 7 7 These are mainly provided as indicative scenarios based solely on different ethanol prices, CED and GHG emissions. [53,56,57,59] Ideally, these systems would be associated with different parameters for a range of other inputs which will be governed by the geographical location of the production systems. The reduction in SIR is mainly due to lower GHG emissions associated with these two ethanol production systems. This analysis is based on comparable assumptions, like combined heat and power based utilities, for both systems to ensure a fair comparison of metrics. However, in reality the fossil based systems with older technologies might not necessarily have such upgrades, thus leading to higher environmental impacts. For example, the absence of a CHP unit for the fossil based system can lower the SIR from 1.23 to 1.17."
9,Updated early stage assessment,"3.4 Updated early stage assessment Table 5 shows the individual indicator results for the updated early stage assessment based on the four reactor design which was adopted considering the insights gained during the detailed process modeling. Since there was no change in the fossil based process data, the values for the fossil based 2-EH in updated ESA remain same as in the primary ESA. As can be observed the biobased process has higher scores (less preferable) for three of the four categories. Fig. 17 shows the integrated results for this updated ESA. With an SIR of 1.18 the ESA now indicates that the biobased process is less preferable as compared to the fossil based process."
10,Comparative analysis,"3.5 Comparative analysis Fig. 18 summarizes the outcome of the three analyses. As explained above, an SIR of more than ‘1’ indicates that the biobased process is less preferable as compared to the fossil based counterpart and vice versa. The difference in primary ESA and the detailed analysis results are mainly due to the fact that the primary ESA was based on a one reactor model while the new insights gained in detailed analysis led to the implementation of a four reactor concept. The conformity of the detailed analysis results with updated ESA indicates the validity of the early stage assessment method. In the updated ESA the biobased process scores increased on all the three early-stage indicators viz. economic constraint, environmental impact of raw material and processing costs and environmental impacts. The reasons behind the specific choices made for primary ESA were the very limited amount of information available and more importantly, the lack of a process engineering perspective. Hence although the early stage assessment gives useful insights in the absence of a detailed process model, it is important that there is a good understanding of the principal design of the process already early on in the research. A variety of reaction and process information like reaction pathways, by-product formation and reaction energy are collected as a part of the early stage analysis. This information can also be used to develop an improved process layout. Such an approach can lead to a more informed early stage assessment which yields more accurate results and hence more specific guidance for catalyst development."
11,Conclusion,"In this study we have considered the developments of catalytic process toward production of Guerbet alcohols from biobased resources. This biobased process was analyzed using techno-economic and life cycle assessment based early stage and detailed metrics at different points in process development timeline. Developments in the laboratory show that the alkaline earth oxide by itself can catalyze the Guerbet reaction, however, higher temperatures are needed which can lead to a higher energy demand. To lower the energy demand of the reaction, addition of a metal function to the alkaline earth oxides, gives better dehydrogenation/hydrogenation leading to much higher productivity than alkaline earth oxides. In addition, a bi-functional catalytic system can make it possible to apply a two reactor configuration for the production of 2-ethyl-1-hexanol from ethanol; however, for this approach a more extensive catalytic study would be required. For future research it is important to incorporate the metrics into laboratory research in an iterative approach for development of effective catalysts. The detailed process analysis for a best case process performance scenario indicated that the biobased process might be less favorable than the fossil based process. However, this outcome depends on the feedstock parameters, system choices and market scenarios. Alternative feedstock choices indicate a comparatively better outcome for the biobased process. System choices like use of a combined heat and power units also affect the outcome. Also this analysis was carried out for a specific Guerbet alcohol (2-EH). Different market scenarios and production systems for other higher alcohols will certainly play an important role. These should be investigated in future to provide specific catalyst development guidance for production of a variety of higher alcohols via biobased processes. From a methodological perspective inclusion of EHS aspects in future can add a new dimension to the analysis and provide additional information about the hazard aspects and their scalability from early-stage to detailed assessment. The integration approach used in this study can be used to incorporate such additional indicators. The same approach can also be applied for analysis of scaled up processes. At the onset of the study an early stage assessment for a future scenario indicated a potentially favorable biobased process. However, this was found to be at odds with the results from detailed analysis which was based on process design, techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment. This difference mainly emanated from the uninformed choices which were made at the onset of the analysis. As demonstrated by the updated early stage assessment the underlying methodology led to similar findings as those from the detailed analysis. This strongly indicates the validity of the methodology proposed for early stage assessment. Hence, although the early stage assessment cannot be a replacement for detailed process analysis, it can certainly provide a quick scanning metric for development of more sustainable chemical processes. According to this case study the main challenge of the early stage assessment is to properly anticipate the reactor configuration. Collaboration with experienced process engineers and better use of the information collected during early stage analysis could make this task more feasible. Nonetheless it is important to recognize that sustainability is a complex subject, which makes it necessary to further improve the early stage assessment methodology to improve its predictive power while incorporating more diverse economic, environmental and social impacts. With increasing sustainability challenges and emergence of a wide variety of potentially interesting solutions, such quick analysis metrics can help to effectively utilize both human and natural capital to enable a sustainable future."
