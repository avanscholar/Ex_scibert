0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is one of the most important raw materials in the chemical and petrochemical industries. Furthermore, it could also be considered as an attractive energy carrier with a reduced environmental impact [1]. Then, it can offer an answer to the threat of global climate change and avoid undesirable issues associated with the use of fossil fuels [2]. Hydrogen does not exist in nature in a form that can be collected and consumed but it can be currently produced by a number of processes such as natural gas or biogas reforming [3], gasification of coal and biomass [4,5], water electrolysis [6], photoelectrolysis [7] and biological processes [8]. Traditionally, large-scale production of hydrogen is mainly based on the methane reforming process. However, this pathway has a non-renewable nature as methane is mainly obtained from natural gas. Furthermore, together with hydrogen, other carbon derived products such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are formed as side products. In this sense, there is a growing interest in the search for effective alternatives to produce hydrogen from renewable sources. In this regard, ethanol is very attractive because of its relatively high hydrogen content, broad availability, non-toxicity, secure storage and handling. In addition, it can be obtained from the fermentation of biomass [9]. The catalytic steam reforming of ethanol is an endothermic process that requires external heat input: (1) C2H5OH+3H2O→2CO2 +6H2 (ΔH =173.1kJmol−1) which could be supplied from external sources in order to maintain the system at a steady reaction temperature. Heat can also be supplied externally by the combustion of part of the feed, by burning combustible off gases or by a combination of both processes. Additionally, the ethanol-steam mixture is catalytically converted to carbon monoxide according to the following reaction: (2) C2H5OH+H2O→2CO+4H2 (ΔH =298.5kJmol−1) Hydrogen production via catalytic reforming of ethanol involves two more additional steps aimed at reducing the concentration of CO below the stringent levels required by hydrogen fuel cells operating downstream: the water gas shift reaction (WGS, Reaction (3)) and CO preferential oxidation reaction (COPROX, Reaction (4) and Reaction (5)). WGS (Reaction (3)) is an important step in which CO is generally oxidized to CO2 in excess steam: (3) CO+H2O↔CO2 +H2 (ΔH=−41kJmol−1) In the COPROX process, the following reactions occurs in the gas phase: (4) CO+1/2O2 →CO2 (ΔH =−238kJmol−1) (5) H2 +1/2O2 →H2O (ΔH =−242kJmol−1) The final step is the purification of the hydrogen from the gas stream exiting the COPROX process, which can be accomplished using several techniques. The most common methods are: pressure-swing-adsorption (PSA) to separate CO2 followed by the condensation of the remaining H2O, PSA to separate H2, and membrane separation of H2 [10]. Consequently, production of high purity hydrogen by catalytic ethanol reforming is a complicated process including several reaction and separation steps. A novel process based on ethanol electrooxidation (also called electrochemical reforming of ethanol) has recently attracted great interest since it allows the simultaneous production of pure hydrogen and accomplished its separation in a single step. In addition, the separation in a single-step of the reaction product from the reaction chamber shifts the reaction equilibrium to the right and thus, higher yields are achieved. This process is based on a low temperature proton exchange membrane (PEM) reactor configuration, consisting on a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) formed by an anode/membrane/cathode, which allows simultaneous production and separation of hydrogen. Consequently, this technology allows to produce pure hydrogen in a quick and convenient way. In addition, this process can be used to store electrical energy via H2 production [11]. Recent studies have shown very promising results when the electrolysis of water–alcohols mixtures proceeds. Thus, methanol [12–15], ethanol and bio-ethanol [11,16], glycerol [17,18] and ethylene glycol [19] have been successfully tested at lab scale. When compared to water electrolysis, the electrochemical reforming of organics can be carried out at significantly lower voltages, thus leading to a reduction of electricity consumptions. In the electrochemical reforming process, an ethanol–water mixture is supplied to the anode cell. The electro-oxidation of ethanol is carried out by applying an electrical power, turning into the production of protons on the anode catalyst-electrode according to the following reaction: (6) C2H5OH+xH2O→Cderivedproducts +yH+ +ye− The produced protons are selectively transported through the PEM membrane to the cathode compartment, which leads to the production of hydrogen: (7) 2H+ +2e− →H2 This study aims to compare the energetic performance of two technologies for renewable hydrogen production via reforming of ethanol–water mixtures: electrochemical and catalytic ones. The performance of both processes was evaluated by material and energy balances performed using conditions reported in the literature. The energetic analysis was carried out by simulating these processes with Aspen HYSYS (Aspen Tech V.7.1). Finally, a comparative study of the two processes was performed in order to evaluate the yield and energy consumption in the production of hydrogen."
1,Methodology,"The simulation of the catalytic steam reforming and electrochemical reforming of ethanol–water mixtures processes was performed under stationary conditions using the flowsheeting simulator Aspen HYSYS (AspenTech V.7.1). Peng–Robinson equation was used to calculate the thermodynamic properties of each flow stream. This equation of state is widely used in reforming processes of ethanol and thus, it was used in this work for comparison purposes [19,20]. The component list was restricted to C2H5OH, H2O, H2, CO, C2H4O, CO2, CH4, O2, N2 and C2H4 for the catalytic steam reforming [21–24] and C2H5OH, H2O, H2 and C2H4O for the electrochemical reforming as experimentally confirmed [16]. The reaction conditions for the catalytic steam reforming of ethanol were taken from literature data for a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (1wt.% metal loading) [21]. In the case of the electrochemical reforming of ethanol, catalysts based on Pt–Ru (40wt.% Pt-20wt.% Ru) and Pt (20wt.% Pt), both supported on carbon, were used. The metal loading was of 1.5mgcm−2and 0.5mgcm−2 for the Pt–Ru and Pt catalysts, respectively. As reported in literature, these metals have been typically used as the anode (Pt–Ru) and cathode (Pt) electrodes in electrochemical reforming reactors [19]. The operating conditions and the polarization curves for the process simulation were also taken from literature [11,19,21–24]. The following assumptions were considered: - Air water and ethanol were injected into the process at room conditions (T =25°C and P =1atm). - The composition of atmospheric air was fixed at 21% O2 and 79% N2. - 10% of excess air was used in the combustion furnace to heat the reforming reactor unit. - 10% of excess air was used in the COPROX reactor unit for CO oxidation. - The adiabatic efficiency of pumps and compressor was considered to be 80%. - An average pressure drop of 9.807kPa was considered for the heat exchangers, heaters and splitter. - The reforming reactor and PEM reactor units were simulated as a conversion reactor using reported data. - WGS and COPROX reactor were simulated as equilibrium reactors."

3,Catalytic steam reforming of ethanol–water process,"3.1 Catalytic steam reforming of ethanol–water process Fig. 1 shows the flow diagram of the catalytic steam reforming process. The hydrogen production process began by pumping liquid water (stream Water) and liquid ethanol (stream Ethanol). Both feedstocks were separately fed at reference environmental conditions, i.e., 25°C and 1atm with a water/ethanol molar ratio=6/1. The streams were later pumped by a centrifugal adiabatic pump to a pressure of 2.5atm and subsequently mixed (stream C-03). This pressure was high enough to deal with the successive pressure drops originated in downstream units. The water/ethanol mixture was then heated (stream C-10) before entering the reformer reactor. The required heat was provided by a heat exchanger network (from HE-01 to HE-06). The final temperature of this stream (T =800°C) was finally reached with heater H-01 [24]. The hydrogen production in the ethanol reformer process was carried out at T =800°C and P =1.8atm with a molar flow of 736.6molh−1 for water and 122.7molh−1 for ethanol. The global conversion of ethanol in this process was fixed at 60% [21]. This conversion was the sum of all the reactions taking place in the catalytic reforming reactor. The reformer reactor (SR) was equipped with a furnace which provides the required heat to perform the endothermic reforming reaction. 30% of the outlet stream coming from the reformer reactor was subsequently fed to the combustor (B-01), which was modeled as an equilibrium reactor. This value was optimized according to the energy consumption through different simulations (not shown here). The minimum amount of supplied energy for H2 production was 32.70kWhkg−1 of H2. Then, stream C-27 was burnt with 10% of excess of air (Stream C-28) [25]. Next, the stream coming from the reformer, which contained mainly H2 and CO, was conducted to the water–gas shift (WGS) reactor, where a large amount of CO is converted to CO2 and H2 (Reaction (3)). Water gas shift reaction is reversible. At low temperatures, the reaction equilibrium shifts to the right and favors the formation of H2 and CO2. On the other hand, at high temperatures, the equilibrium shifts to the left, limiting the complete conversion of CO [26]. As usual, this reaction was carried out in two steps. This way, a high temperature shift reactor (HTS), which operates at 400°C, and a low temperature shift reactor (LTS), which operates at 250°C, were considered [22]. The remaining CO coming from the latter reactor was oxidized with 10% excess of air [22] (Reaction (4)) in a COPROX reactor unit at 170°C. As expected, hydrogen was also oxidized (Reaction (5)). The lack of inlet air in the COPROX reactor (operating at 170°C [23]) produce an incomplete conversion of CO, i.e., the CO concentration did not reach the specified value (20ppm). On the contrary, an excess of air can produce an excessive oxidation of hydrogen, leading to a decrease of its yield [27,28]. In addition, an excess of air increases the electric energy consumption in the compressor [25]. The temperature of the reactor clearly influenced the performance of both reactions. A strong temperature increase due to the high exothermicity of both reactions involves a loss of selectivity towards CO oxidation since its activation energy is lower than that of H2 oxidation. In addition, low reaction temperatures reduce the possibility of formation of NO x (produced from the reaction of nitrogen and oxygen gases in the air during combustion). Finally, the hydrogen was separated by using a membrane process (SP-01) at 300°C [10], which was modeled as a black box (split unit) with a prescribed membrane effectiveness releasing a pure hydrogen stream (Stream C-30). The membrane effectiveness was defined as the molar percentage of the inlet hydrogen that was transferred to the product stream [10]. In practice, a real membrane should be capable of producing hydrogen with purity higher than 99% (Stream Hydrogen). The different material and process energy are shown in Table 1 ."
4,Electrochemical reforming of ethanol–water process,"3.2 Electrochemical reforming of ethanol–water process For the hydrogen production via electrochemical reforming of ethanol, an integrated process was proposed according to a previous work focused on the electrochemical reforming of ethylene glycol [19] (Fig. 2 ). Aspen HYSYS cannot directly simulate an electrochemical reforming PEM reactor unit but it could be modeled as a sequence of a conversion reactor and a split separation unit, where the produced hydrogen was completely separated from the reaction mixture. Table 2 summarizes the description of the different material and process energy included in the process. The operating conditions of this process were optimized in a previous work devoted to the electrochemical reforming of ethylene glycol [19]. Water and ethanol were mixed at 2atm to form a 1mlmin−1 flow with a concentration 6M ethanol. Then, the mixture was preheated by a heat exchanger (HE-01) using the sub-product stream C-10. This stream contained water and acetaldehyde produced by the electrochemical reforming of ethanol according to the following overall reaction: (8) C2H5OH→C2H4O+H2 The resulting stream (C-04) was then mixed with the recycle stream which was rich in ethanol (C-09). The stream (C-05) was heated to 90°C (operating temperature of the PEM electrochemical reforming unit). The electrochemical reforming of ethanol–water mixtures occurred at the anode of the PEM (A), leading to the production of acetaldehyde (Reaction (8)) (C-07) and pure hydrogen in the cathode (C) (Reaction (7)). Stream C-07 also contained an important amount of unreacted ethanol, due to the low efficiency of the process. Consequently, this stream (C-07) was separated in a splitter unit (S-01) and then pumped and recycled (C-09) to the PEM electrochemical reforming cell. The splitter unit (S-01) allowed to calculate, in a theoretical way, the energy required for the separation of the unreacted ethanol."
5,Process simulation and energetic evaluation,"Table 3 illustrates the main operation parameters used in the simulation of both processes [11,19,21–24]. Firstly, the temperature of the reformer reactor was established from a previous study of the catalytic ethanol steam reforming. According to Khila et al. [22], the highest hydrogen concentration was obtained at a temperature of 800°C. Temperatures beyond 800°C would increase the heat required, thus reducing the process efficiency. Thus, a steam reforming reactor temperature of 800°C was selected. According to Liguras et al. [21], the overall ethanol conversion for a reforming process carried out at 800°C with a Pt catalyst is 60% under the explored reaction conditions. In this work, the following side reactions in the reforming reactor was also considered: (2) C2H5OH+H2O→2CO+4H2 (9) C2H5OH+2H2 →2CH4 +H2O (10) C2H5OH→C2H4 +H2O (8) C2H5OH→C2H4O+H2 The conversion of each reaction were established from the selectivity values reported by Liguras et al. [21] (Table 3). 80% of the CO was converted in the high temperature water gas shift reactor (HTS) whereas 12% of the remaining CO was converted in the lower temperature water gas shift one (LTS). The gas leaving the WGS reactors contained about 1% of CO due to thermodynamics limitations [22]. Therefore, a second step for removing CO was necessary. In the COPROX reactor, the remaining CO was oxidized to CO2 at 170°C with a 10% excess air (Reaction (4)). Giunta el al., [23] analyzed different temperature control schemes for the COPROX reaction and found that the most suitable temperature in terms of selectivity toward CO was 170°C. However, hydrogen is partially oxidized at these conditions (Reaction (5)) [25]. Reaction (5) was thermodynamically favored because the hydrogen concentration in the mixture was clearly higher than that of CO. For this reason, the catalyst used should be highly selective to the total oxidation of CO (Reaction (4)). The product stream was mainly composed by hydrogen, containing less than 20ppm of CO. The high purity of this stream made it suitable to be used in PEM fuel cells [23]. The final step is the separation of the hydrogen from the gas stream exiting the COPROX reactor, which is mostly constituted by H2, H2O, C2H5O, CO2 and air, which can be accomplished through a membrane. Membrane processes for hydrogen separation is a promising technology that is receiving high attention in the last years, producing a high purity hydrogen stream (>99%). The membrane operated at 300°C and pure hydrogen was obtained at atmospheric pressure [10]. Table 4 summarizes the values of the main variables of the catalytic steam reforming process. It can be observed that the hydrogen production rate was 85.09molh−1 i.e., 0.0236mols−1. Additionally, several byproducts with industrial applications such as ethylene, acetaldehyde and methane were also obtained. Acetaldehyde is mainly used as a starting material in the synthesis of acetic acid, n-butyl alcohol, ethyl acetate, and other chemical compounds. Ethylene is the raw material used in the manufacture of polymers and methane can be used as fuel and raw material for synthesizing other compounds. As abovementioned, the operating conditions of the electrochemical reforming unit were obtained from a previous work [11,19]. The ethanol–water mixture (6M ethanol concentration) was fed at 90°C with a flow rate of 1mlmin−1 (stream C-06). The electrical energy applied to the PEM cell (e4) was set from the current–potential curves (I =0.4A and V cell =0.9V) [11,19]. These parameters were directly related to the hydrogen produced in the cathodic side of the PEM cell by the Faraday law, i.e., r H2 = I /nF, where r H2 is the hydrogen production rate (mols−1), n is the number of transferred electrons, and F is the Faraday constant. This theoretical hydrogen production rate value was experimentally confirmed by de Lucas-Consuegra et al. [16,19]. As described by Caravaca et al. [16], acetaldehyde is one of main byproducts from the electrochemical reforming of ethanol. For this reason, acetaldehyde was assumed to be the unique by-product of the reaction (Reaction (8)). Table 5 shows the value of the overall molar balances of the electrochemical reforming unit. Under these conditions the ethanol conversion obtained in the simulation process was 2.05% for a hydrogen production rate of 7.46210−3 molh−1 i.e., 2.07210−6 mols−1. Fig. 3 summarizes the value of the overall energy consumption per mol of hydrogen produced in the different units of the process of steam reforming (a) and electrochemical reforming (b). It can be observed that the highest energy input for the catalytic steam reforming was the energy stream e-3 (unit H-01), which provided the additional energy to heat the inlet stream (C-03) at the reforming reactor temperature (T =800°C). Energy stream e-4 accounted for the second highest energy consumption in the process, which was used for providing the necessary energy to carry out the endothermic reforming reaction. This result is in agreement with a previous work of Tippawan and Arpornwichanop [29]. On the other hand, the lower energy consumption corresponded to the energy required for pumping the feed streams (e-01 and e-02). In the electrochemical reforming process, two kinds of energy streams can be distinguished: the process energy (e-1, e-2, e-3, e-5, e-6), which includes all the energy required in the process except the electrical energy needed for the electrochemical reforming reaction and electrical ones (e-4). In this case, the highest energy input corresponded to the electrical energy consumption in the PEM cell (e-4=173.6kJmol−1 H2). This energy consumption was similar to that recently reported (116.3kJmol−1 H2) for the electrochemical reforming of ethylene glycol [19]. Both values were obtained from experimental potential and current values, i.e., P = V × I (W). This electrical energy value is more than twice the thermal energy required for heating stream C-05 (e-3) and several orders of magnitude higher than those required for the pumping of streams and the separation of the unreacted ethanol. Fig. 4 displays for each process a comparison between the amount of produced H2 in kg of hydrogen per kg of ethanol and the energy balance in kWh per kg of hydrogen. For comparative purposes, the yield of hydrogen production was referred to the amount of consumed ethanol (Fig. 4a). Regarding the catalytic steam reforming of ethanol, the value obtained in this work (0.0301kg H2 kg−1 C2H5OH) was similar to that reported by Khila et al., [22] (0.0347kg H2 kg−1 C2H5OH). Regarding the case of the electrochemical reforming of ethanol, the obtained value (0.0434kg H2 kg−1 C2H5OH) was in the same range than those obtained by de Lucas-Consuegra et al., [19] for the case of the electrochemical reforming of ethylene glycol (0.0598kg H2 kg−1 C2H6O2). From the feed stock consumption point of view, it was observed that the electrochemical reforming process was slightly more productive that the catalytic one. On the other hand, the overall energy consumption for both processes was also calculated (Fig. 4b). It can be seen that the electrochemical reforming process consumed less energy per kg of hydrogen produced, (29.2kWhkg−1 of H2) than the catalytic one (32.70kWhkg−1 of H2). The higher energy efficiency of the electrochemical reforming process for H2 production, if compared to that of the catalytic one, can be related to the simplicity of this process, which also operates at higher temperatures and pressures and does not require of further purification and separation steps (e.g., water gas shift reactors, COPROX reactor, etc.). It should be mentioned that a lower consumption energy value (12.18kWhkg−1 of H2) have been previously reported for the ethanol steam reforming process [24]. In the present work, experimental catalytic results were used in the simulation of the reforming unit, in contrast with reference [24], where the authors assumed that the reforming reactor operated at equilibrium conditions. Concerning the electrochemical reforming process, a value of 17.14kWhkg−1 of H2 was recently reported for the electrochemical reforming of ethylene glycol [19]. On the other hand, a value of 21.53kWhkg−1 of H2 was also reported for a methanol electrolyzer stack [30] where the electrical energy was the only requirement considered. Unlike this work where the electrical energy requirement (29.2kWh/kg of H2) was set from the deactivated current–potential curves, i.e., when the system reaches the steady state value, references [19] and [30] set this requirement from fresh MEA. In addition, it should be mentioned that the electrical energy consumption value found here is lower than the amount of energy required by a commercial water electrolyzer stacks, which are in the range of 53.4–70.1kWhkg−1 of H2 produced [26,31]. In this sense, the US Department of Energy (DOE) has pointed out that the electrical energy input to the electrolyzer stack should drop to 43kWhkg−1 of H2 in 2020 [32]. Even considering the DOE output energy for ethanol of 7.4kWhkg−1 of H2 [33], the value of the required total energy for the electrochemical reforming of ethanol make this technology to be competitive. The use of ethanol is certainly promising due to its possible renewable production (fermentation of biomass or steam reforming of cellulosic materials) with reasonably low energy cost [34]. Ethanol allows electrolysis at potential <1V if compared to that of water (1.23V), leading to electrical power savings [16,34]. Apart that the electrochemical reforming process seems to be more simple and competitive that the most widely studied catalytic steam reforming, the former process allows to produce H2 of high purity quickly and conveniently (single reaction and a separation step at mild operating conditions)."
6,Conclusions,"The following conclusions could be drawn from this study: - The electrochemical reforming process allowed to obtain pure hydrogen in a single step while the catalytic process required additional steps of purification and separation leading to a more complicated H2 production plant. - For the catalytic steam reforming process electrical and thermal energy consumption was considered. The highest energy consumption corresponded to the stream e-3, which provided the energy required to heat the outlet stream from the heat exchanger network to the reforming reactor temperature (T =800°C). - Electrical energy consumption and process energy (electrical and thermal energy) consumption were computed in the electrochemical reforming process. In this case, the main energy requirement was the electrical energy one. - The electrochemical reforming process seemed to be less intensive in feed stock material and energy consumption for H2 production than the process based on the catalytic conventional route. In addition, the calculated energy consumption of the overall electrochemical reforming process was lower than that required by a traditional water electrolyzer stack."
