0,Introduction,"Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) is the first type of calcium silicate composite developed by Torabinejad for dental applications [1]. As a root filling material, MTA has received particular attention in the dentistry due to its bioactivity properties and capability of sealing the existing gap between the root canal space and the surface of the external root [2]. The perfect biocompatibility, not releasing calcium ions into the body solution, high pH, root canal high sealability, hard tissue formation induction, radiopacity, curing ability aside moisture, antibacterial features, body fluids small solubility, excellent dimensional stability, and adjustment to tooth structure have led to the MTA wide application in the dental field [3]. Despite the entire cited virtues of the MTA cement, long setting time and low workability must be resolved [4]. Many efforts have been made to eliminate these shortcomings while holding the many favorable characteristics of the MTA [5]. A new calcium silicate base compound was introduced by Sanaee and Danesh Manesh to improve the setting behavior of this dental material. The idea was based on decreasing the particle size on a nanometer scale and not using any chemical additive. The cement is named Nano Fast Cement (NFC) [6]. According to their results, however, decreasing the MTA particle size decreases the setting time considerably; it has a negative impact on both compressive and flexural strength. The compressive and flexural strength of MTA is an essential factor due to the increased risk of failure and possible micropenetrate in clinical applications. Micropenetrate can occur at the tooth to material interface and also through the material microstructure [7]. The other drawbacks of the NFC consist of poor workability because of the consistency related to sand and first looseness. Considering this, the NFC could be conveniently cleansed by water and hard to be employed in particular clinical treatment [8]. One method of achieving sufficient workability and high strength in cement is to use a water-reducing mixture like polymers to improve its flow and workability [9]. The styrene-butadiene rubber, SBR, emulsion and the poly(acrylic ester), PAE, emulsion have been vastly used as concrete mixture admixtures [10]. Also, cement workability can be improved by adding methylcellulose or calcium chloride. It has also been found that poly(vinyl alcohol), PVA, addition to the Portland cement improves its resistance of crack, adhesion property, finishing capability, shape durability, alkali resistance, and dispersibility [11]. PVA is regarded as a hydrophilic synthetic polymer, employed to fortify concrete cement to provide alkali resistance and high tensile strength. Furthermore, it offers acceptable chemical and physical adhesive characteristics because of its hydrophilicity. The good impact of PVA upon cement paste workability is principally explained for better consistency on the grounds of not only the ball bearing action but also the polymer dispersing impact. Yet relatively high polymer-to-cement ratios decrease the paste workability on account of a rise in paste viscosity [12,13]. The PVA slows down the hydration; however, it raises the compressive strength and lessens the porosity of concrete. These outcomes originate from the chemical interaction between the PVA and cement. This study aimed to use the PVA as an additive to improve the workability and strength of the NFC, yet, properties such as setting time, biocompatibility, and radiopacity retain acceptably. For achieving the goal PVA with 0, 3, 6 and 9 wt% was added to NFC. The setting time and workability of NFC and NFC/PVA combination were investigated. The present phases, morphology and microstructure of NFC and NFC/PVA were analyzed utilizing the X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and field emission scanning microscopy (FESM). The mechanical behavior of the fabricated nanocomposite was investigated using compressive and flexural testing. The relationship between changes in mechanical properties and microstructural variation due to adding PVA in NFC has been discussed in detail. The biocompatibility of the NFC and NFC/PVA samples was evaluated on MCF-7 cell lines using MTT assay. Radiopacity is an essential physical characteristic required for sealer materials to be identified in the root canal. The radiopacity of NFC and NFC/PVA samples were examined according to ISO 6876/2012 [14]."
1,Material and methods,"Materials used in this study consisted of modifying Portland cement (Sanat Avaran Vista, Iran) as the base component, PVA (molecular weight range 146,000–186,000 g/mol, degree of hydrolysis> 99.0%; Aldrich, St Louis, MO) as the additives and distilled water as the solvent. Particle size analysis (PSA) was carried out on the cement powders utilizing VASCO Flex equipment (Cordouan Technologies, Pessac, France) to find the initial cement particle sizes."
2,Powder preparation,"2.1 Powder preparation The most important step was to prepare the NFC powder. For this purpose, the cement particles were reduced to nano-size utilizing a Wet-Stirred-Media-Milling (WSMM). The WSMM take place in a vertical and cylindrical crushing chamber made of polyethylene. The ceramic beads and modify Portland cement was added to the grinding chamber. Pure ethanol (99.9%, Merck, Germany) was added to the mixture to fill half the chamber. A vertical rotating shaft with horizontal vanes was embedded into the chamber. Then, a stirrer was utilized to make a strike between the grinding media for a time delay of 15 h. A stainless steel mesh detached the beads from the solution of NFC and ethanol. To get a dry NFC and to expedite the ethanol escape, the solution was incubated in a dryer chamber with a constant temperature of 37 °C and within 24 h. The prepared cement powder is called NFC, as stated by Sanaee and Danesh Manesh [6]. The PSA method was utilized to measure final particle sizes. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, MIRA3-TESCAN, Czech Republic) was used to observe the morphology of the prepared NFC powders."
3,Solution preparation,"2.2 Solution preparation The PVA aqueous solution has been prepared by dissolving the PVA powder in the water at a temperature of 80 °C. The water contains 0, 3, 6, and 9 wt% PVA was used to product NFC0, NFC3, NFC6 and NFC9 samples, respectively."
4,Paste preparation and molding,"2.3 Paste preparation and molding In this stage, the nanocomposite powders were mixed by solution with different amounts of PVA. They gently stirred using a spatula for 30 s to attain a deformable and homogenous paste. The chemical compositions of NFC0, NFC3, NFC6, and NFC9 paste are presented in Table 1 . The obtained pastes were molded in silicone molds and allowed to set. The material processing is schematically shown in Fig. 1 ."
5,Phase evaluation,"2.4 Phase evaluation The hydrated and un-hydrated NFC samples were analyzed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) method to identify the presence phases. The XRD patterns were determined with a diffractometer (D8 Advance Model, Bruker, Germany) utilizing Cu-kα radiation at a wavelength of 1.5 A in the 2θ range of 20°–60°. Identification of patterns was performed using JCPDS reference cards and Xpert high score software."
6,Microstructural evaluation,"2.5 Microstructural evaluation Scanning electron microscopy (VEGA3-TESCAN, Czech) was used to study the structural changes of samples after one day of hydration. The samples were covered with gold using the sputtering method for better electrical conductivity. The SEM images were taken at different magnification. Then, the morphology and distribution of pores were evaluated through the SEM observations. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was performed with a spectrometer ((RONTEC, USA) to find elemental distribution through the microstructures."
7,Physical and mechanical properties evaluation,"2.6 Physical and mechanical properties evaluation 2.6.1 Setting time The NFC setting times were assessed according to ISO 6876/2012 [14]. The experiment materials were blended and molded in cylindrical stainless steel die with a diameter of 5 mm and a height of 10 mm. After mixing, the samples were put in an incubator at a temperature of 37 °C and relative humidity of 95%. A 1 mm diameter flattened indenter was employed with a 400 g load and lowered meticulously and perpendicularly to the tested material surface. This process was reiterated every 60 s. The final setting time was registered when the needle was not capable of making an indentation. 2.6.2 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) In the present study, the hydration processes of the NFC and NFC/PVA nanocomposite has been monitored utilizing FTIR. The FTIR spectra were obtained for anhydrous NFC powder and all hydrated specimens using a Spectrometer (Tensor II, Bruker, Germany). Spectra were acquired in transmission mode from powders in the frequency range of 500–4000 cm−1. 2.6.3 Compressive strength Universal testing machine (Intron, Zwick, Germany) with a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min was used for the measurement of the produced calcium silicate nanocomposite compressive strength (Fig. 2 a). Each specimen was tested after a 24-h molding in a silicone mold (4 mm in diameter and 6 mm in height). Three samples were tested for each prepared composite. After testing, the maximum load needed to break off each sample was specified as its compressive strength. 2.6.4 Flexural strength The universal testing machine with an indenter and a grip designed for bending test was used for measurement of flexural strength of different samples. The prepared samples with beam shapes were permitted to set for 24 h. Then three-point bending test was performed at room temperature and a 1 mm/min crosshead speed. The equipment and sample setting in equipment are shown in Fig. 2b. 2.6.5 Workability The workability of samples was assessed by a texture analyzer (CT3, Brookfield, Middleboro, USA) with a 4.5 kg load cell. The analytical probe with a 5 mm diameter was compressed into each specimen with a one-cubic-centimeter volume up to 4 mm depth at 0.02 mm/s rate after blending the sample. The probe measured the maximum contact force necessary for compression up to specified depth as the workability. 2.6.6 Biocompatibility Biomaterials that will be in permanent contact with the body tissues should exhibit low cytotoxicity [15]. The MTT assay is a proper method for assessment of cell viability and determines of biomaterial toxicity [16]. The cytotoxicity of the NFC and NFC/PVA samples was evaluated on MCF-7 cell lines utilizing MTT assay. In this method, H2O2 was used as the positive control and culture medium was considered as negative control. In the next step, 106 cells were suspended in 15 ml of RPMI% medium containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and transferred by a sampler, 100 μL of the cell suspension to a 96 well microplate, thereby sowing 10,000 cells. Then, the microplate incubated in an incubator contains 95% air, 5% CO2, and a temperature of 37 °C to give the cells a stable state. Afterwards, 100 μL of the synthesized cement particles were replaced with previous media. In the next step, 25 μL of the MTT was transferred to each well and incubated for 4 h in standard condition. Due to the mitochondrial performance of viable cells, purple formazan crystals formed, which dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used to dissolve them. Finally, the absorption of each well was measured at 570 nm wavelength utilizing a microplate reader (Model 50, Bio-Rad Corp, Hercules, California, USA). 2.6.7 Radiopacity Radiopacity is an essential physical characteristic required for the cement to be identified in the root canal. For evaluating this property, the NFC samples were prepared according to ISO 6876/2012 [14]. Then the specimens were compressed into a ring-shaped die with an internal diameter of 10 mm and 1 mm height. Afterwards, the specimens were stored at 37 °C and relative humidity over 95% in an incubator for 24 h. Each sample was radiographed aside an aluminium step wedge in the thickness range of 1–10 mm and increments of 1 mm as a reference. The images were taken using a radiographer camera (Gilardoni S.P.A, Italy) that operates at 60 Kv and four mA. The exposure time and target-film distance were considered as 0.3 min and 30 cm, respectively. A densitometer (Macbeth model, Italy) was used to control the optical density of the X-ray films."
8,Results & discussion,
9,Material characterization,"3.1 Material characterization Particle size analysis (PSA) indicated that the mean particle size of the prime Portland cement was 2723 nm. The PSA measurements revealed that the cement particle sizes were reduced to 322 nm after WSMM operation. The FE-SEM images of the initial and final cement particles (NFC) are presented in Fig. 3 . The XRD examination was performed to identify the compounds present in un-hydrated and hydrated nanocomposite cement. The results of XRD examination are given in Fig. 4 . As can be seen from Fig. 4a, the un-hydrated NFC is composed primarily of di-calcium silicate, tri-calcium silicate, and zirconium dioxide. Tri-calcium silicate and di-calcium silicate exhibit strong multi-peaks at 29.42°, 32°, 32.2°, 34.26°, and 41.24°. The XRD results of hydrated NFC are plotted in Fig. 4b. As illustrated, the hydrated NFC consists of di and tri-calcium silicate, calcium hydroxide, and C–S–H gel. Di and tri-calcium silicate are prime components of the cement that has not been involved in the hydration reactions, exhibit peaks in a similar location of un-hydrated NFC (Fig. 4a). Calcium hydroxide and C–S–H gel are the productions of hydration reactions. The peak of calcium hydroxide is sharply seen at 34.1°and 47.13°. The characteristic peaks of the C–S–H compound weakly revealed, and are located at angles of 32.4°, 32.9° and 46.2°. Zirconium oxide peaks are visible at hydrated and un-hydrated products and angles of 27.37°, 31.40°, and 49.3°. It means this compound has not been involved in the hydration reactions."
10,The effect of poly(vinyl alcohol) on setting behavior,"3.2 The effect of poly(vinyl alcohol) on setting behavior The NFC composed of the hydrophilic particles which harden at the presence of moisture [6]. This material is an alternative for MTA, which shows a long setting time that is a disadvantage in clinical application [17]. In this section, the setting behavior of NFC has been evaluated. Moreover, the effects of PVA on the setting time of NFC have been discussed. Setting or hydration of NFC is due to a series of complicated reactions. As it is seen from the XRD results, elements of NFC that are involved in the hydration reactions include tri-calcium silicate or C3S (Ca3SiO5) and di-calcium silicate or C2S (Ca2SiO4), and the reaction products contain C–S–H gel and Ca(OH)2. The reactions have been introduced for hydration are as follow [18]: (1) C 3 S + H 2 O → C - S - H + C a ( O H ) 2 (2) C 2 S + H 2 O → C - S - H + C a ( O H ) 2 The most active component is C3S that hardens the cement in the early stage of the hydration processes [19]. The main product component in this stage is C–S–H, which has low crystallinity and is mostly in the form of amorphous. This part is the primary binding phase in calcium silicate-based cement and an essential factor in cement hardening. The initial and final setting time of different produced samples is compared in Fig. 5 . According to Fig. 5, the initial setting time of NFC0 (sample free of PVA) is about 5 min, and the final setting time for this sample was measured as 15.75 min. One of the most used cement in dental applications is the MTA [20]. It has been reported a setting time of 2–3 h for this material, which is very slow and may cause clinical problems [21]. The results indicate using the net NFC can shorten the setting time in order of 7.5–11 times compare to the MTA. Also, Fig. 5 shows that the initial and final setting times of NFC rise with the increase in amount of PVA in the prepared samples. The increase in setting time by the increase of PVA is due to the influence of PVA on retardation of the hydration reactions [11]. Spectroscopic system is generally used to investigate the chemistry of cement hydration products. In infrared spectroscopy different molecules absorb different wavelengths of infrared lights depending on atoms that constituent the molecule or group, therefore, be utilized to find both crystalline and amorphous phases [22]. For more clarification, the FTIR test was taken on the hydrated and un-hydrated samples. The FTIR analyses of hydrated samples with varying values of PVA are plotted in Fig. 6 . The peaks appeared at 454, 796, 896, 2321, and 2962 cm−1 corresponds to zirconia. The characteristic absorption peak of carbonates is seen at 1452 cm−1 and 1412 cm−1 that confirm the presence of C2S and C3S in un-hydrated NFC. The FTIR of hydrated specimens shows that the peak of free hydroxyl in the Ca(OH)2 molecule, generated during the NFC hydration reactions, appears at 3414 cm−1. With attention to Fig. 6, the intensity of this peak decreases with increasing the amount of PVA that indicates decreasing of Ca(OH)2 component in the NFC hydration productions. The characteristic absorption peak of the most essential cement hydration productions C–S–H (Si–O is band related to C–S–H), is located near 514, 1015 and 1250 cm−1. Fig. 6 shows that using PVA decreases the spectral data at 1250 Cm−1 that it is a reason for the reduction of C–S–H gel in the sample. Dropping of C–S–H gel in the NFC is a reason for increasing the hardening or setting time of produced cement. The results coincide well with the setting time investigation presented in Fig. 5. The increase of setting time in the NFC/PVA combination can be explained by the effects of this polymer on the hydration reactions. Investigations have shown that the presence of a water-soluble polymer such as PVA extends the induction time and interferes with the initial cement hydration reactions [23]. Several explanations are available for these interfere of the cement and polymers: Firstly, polymers can be covered the surface of un-hydrated cement particles, that of preventing the contact with water [24]. Secondly, the poly(vinyl alcohol), used in the present study, contains a large number of hydroxyl groups, which can form hydrogen bonds with oxygen ions on the surfaces of the anhydrous components and prevent the formation of hydration compounds [25]. Third, the adsorption of polymers on the Ca(OH)2 and C–S–H nucleation sites can disturb the development of those phases [26]. Some researchers connected the retardation of the cement hydration reactions in water/polymer solution to the ion constancy. The constancy of ions is due to the dissolution of polymer in water and the increase of the viscosity of the mixture. Increasing the viscosity of the mixing water restricts the movements of ions and reduces the dissolution rate of the un-hydrated phases and the precipitation of hydrates [27]. It is important to note, although, there is a relative increase in the setting time of samples with PVA, the setting time is still much less than MTA. Interestingly, this increase in setting time by using PVA improved handling of the NFC for dental applications."
11,Workability evaluation,"3.3 Workability evaluation The maximum contact force necessary for compression up a probe with a diameter of 5 mm to a 4 mm depth in the prepared pastes, was measured as the workability. The contact force of the prepared samples with 0, 3, 6, and 9 wt% PVA is compared in Fig. 7 . With attention to the figure, the required contact force of samples decreases sharply by using 3 wt% PVA in the NFC paste and then increase slightly by utilizing 6 and 9 wt% PVA. The contact forces for the sample contain 0 wt% PVA (NFC0) is 1123 gr, which decreased to 204 gr by using 3 wt% PVA in the NFC3. It can be seen that using 3 wt% of PVA causes 5.5-time improvement in the workability of the NFC paste. Improving the NFC workability by adding the small amount of polymer (3 wt%) can be explained by the effect of this additive on the physical properties of the mixture. According to the result of Knapen, the workability of the cement/polymer is significantly improved because of the plasticizing and air-entraining effects of the polymer [28]. The modified system shows higher water trapping than the conventional cement systems. This may be related to an improvement in the prevention of dry-out, and it also leads to superior adhesion to porous substrates of the cement. Furthermore, utilizing water-soluble polymers decreases bleeding and improves the homogeneity of cement by controlling the segregation of fresh mixtures [29]. Another positive impact of PVA on the cement paste workability is mainly interpreted in terms of improved consistency of composite due to both the ‘ball-bearing’ action and the dispersing effect of polymer. The ball-bearing action facilitates the movement of the particles over each other, which in turn enhances the fluidity or the workability of the paste [30]. According to Fig. 7, NFC6, and NFC9 specimens contain 6 and 9 wt% PVA, respectively, required a contact force of 253–500 gr. However, the values of workability are still higher than NFC0 but show some drop compared with NFC3. This drop possibly associated with the strong cohesive force of PVA, which restricts the flow of cement particles during the mixing processes [31]. Moreover, when the weight percent of the PVA increases, the paste workability decreases due to the increases of paste viscosity."
12,Microstructural investigation,"3.4 Microstructural investigation Fig. 8 shows SEM images of the NFC with 0, 3, 6, and 9 wt% of PVA after 24 h of setting. As seen in this figure, the microstructure, pore size, and pore distribution of NFC changed due to incorporation with PVA. Fig. 8a shows the microstructure of the sample contains 0 wt% PVA (NFC0). The zirconia particles were being intertwined with the cement hydration outputs (C–S–H matrix & calcium hydroxide crystals) can be seen in the microstructure. Some small and large multifaceted pores are also visible in the microstructure of NFC0. Fig. 8b shows the microstructure of the modified NFC with 3 wt% of PVA (NFC3). The surface image shows the C–S–H matrix along with the pores where the calcium hydroxide crystals are dispersed in this background phase. A thin layer of the polymer which continually precipitated to form a polymer film is seen in the microstructure. The size and shape of pores in NFC3 decreased compare to NFC0. The decrease is due to the presence of PVA that enhanced the NFC particle movements to fill the gaps, thereby shrink the pores into the medium-size or even wipe many of them out. Fig. 8c is the SEM image of NFC with a 6 wt% PVA (NFC6). It is seen as PVA content increases, polymer film blend with the hydration products in the fast cement matrix that form an interconnected network structure. This structure enhances the mechanical properties of the NFC6, especially flexural and compressive strength. Decreasing of pore size is also seen in the SEM observation of NFC6. Fig. 8d is the SEM image of NFC with 9 wt% PVA (NFC9). It can be seen; the excessive incorporation of PVA in NFC9 led to the formation of a dense polymer film on the hydration products. This massive layer of polymer on NFC covered the cement particles and prevented them from having contact with water. This phenomenon delayed the rate of hydration reactions and consequently caused an increase in setting time that has already been discussed. Fig. 8d indicates that the size and volume percentage of the pores has decreased considerably with the rise of PVA to 9 wt%. The large amounts of polymer in NFC9 facilitated the movement of the cement particles and caused filling the gaps. The polymer itself also moves via the cement particles and fill up more free spaces, and that is a strong reason for the increase in NFC strength, which will be discussed later. The elemental map of Ca, Si, C, O, and Zr were taken from the hydrated NFC sample (NFC0) to detect how elements and compounds were distributed in the microstructure. The resultants are presented in Fig. 9 . As it is seen, the hydrated NFC consists of calcium, silicon, carbon, oxygen, and zirconium. The homogeneity distributions of these elements are seen in EDS analysis of the hydrated NFC. The EDS analysis and phase evaluations (Fig. 4) also confirm the presence of phases that are marked on the microstructural analysis."
13,Mechanical properties evaluation,"3.5 Mechanical properties evaluation Mechanical tests were performed to find the material strength and to assess the resistance of the material to incoming functional loads. Strength is defined as the amount of stress necessary to cause material failure. Two types of strength are important in endodontic, including compressive and flexural strength. Here, we examined these mechanical behaviors of NFC/PVA nanocomposite, utilizing compressive and flexural tests. Fig. 10 demonstrates the variation of compressive strength of produced samples with respect to the weight percentage of PVA. Overall, the sample strength increases with increasing the PVA content. The compressive strength rose from 8.1 MPa to 13.1 MPA when the PVA increased from 0 to 3 %wt (NFC0 & NFC3 samples). It is an enhancement of about 62%. The increase in strength is more noticeable as PVA content in NFC increased from 0 to 9 wt% (NFC9 sample). The value of compressive strength for this sample is about 2.8 times higher than that of NFC0. It is important to note that NFC3 showed optimum workability. The effects of poly(vinyl alcohol) on the flexural strength of NFC are presented in Fig. 10. The same trend can be seen in the flexural strength of NFC with the variation of PVA content. The graph shows that the flexural strength of NFC increases by 23% with an increase of PVA content from 0 to 3 wt%. Again the maximum increase in flexural strength was obtained of NFC9 sample with 9 wt% PVA. The enhancement for this sample was about 2.4 times that of NFC0. The flexural strength is more clinically relevant than compressive strength, because it better reflects the clinical function of restorative material. A restorative site may be exposed to flexural loading and causes perforation of repairs followed by micro-leakage and associated bacterial penetration [32]. Flexural strength is also crucial during amalgam condensation upon the NFC repair region in where stress related to amalgam condensation can increase up to 9 MPa [33]. The improvement of the compressive and flexural strength is attributed to the role of PVA in bonding between aggregates and the reduction of pores in NFC. When PVA mixed with NFC, PVA fibers autonomously occupy the interface between the solid particles. They may increase the paste aggregate bond and decrease the interfacial transition zone thickness in total paste bond model system [34]. This mechanism is schematically shown in Fig. 11 . Furthermore, the mechanical strength of cement is principally relevant to the size, number, and shape of porosities. It has been revealed that the compressive strength of the cement-based nanocomposites increases with decreasing the size and number of the porosities [35]. The SEM micrographs of NFC, nanocomposite with and without PVA have been shown in Fig. 8. The results indicate that by using PVA in NFC the size and amount of pore decreased significantly. This decrease is more clearly visible when compared the NFC0 microstructure to the NFC9."
14,Biocompatibility of NFC/PVA,"3.6 Biocompatibility of NFC/PVA An endodontic material must be tested biologically by in vitro examinations before implantation in the body to minimize its adverse effects. In other words, dental materials that are in permanent contact with the body tissues should display low toxicity [36]. The MTT assay is a proper system for diagnosis of cell viability and specifies of biomaterial toxicity. The results of MTT assay for the control cell, NFC0 free of PVA, and NFC3 with 3%wt PVA, which indicates the optimum workability are presented in Fig. 12 . It can be seen from the results, the cell viability in NFC0 was about 82% and that for NFC3 was about 69%, when compared to the control cell. The results indicated that the NFC and NFC/PVA nanocomposite are biocompatible."
15,The effect of PVA on the radiopacity of samples,"3.7 The effect of PVA on the radiopacity of samples In this study, the zirconium oxide was used as a radiopacifer in replacement of bismuth oxide. The reason for such a choice might be due to some investigation results which show the zirconium oxide possesses biocompatible characteristics with favorable mechanical properties and corrosion resistance [37]. A minimum value of radiopacity is crucial to diagnose the material in the root canal, and allow filling failures to be identified and corrected before finishing the restoration. The minimum radiopacity required by ISO 6876/2001 specifications is equivalent to 3 mm of aluminum [14]. Prepared samples with 0, 3, 6, and 9 %wt PVA were used for the radiopacity test. The results of this test are presented in Table 2 . Overall, all test samples have shown radiopacity values higher than the 3 mm equivalent of Aluminum. The NFC0 contains 0 wt% PVA shows the radiopacity equivalent of 3.3 mmAl. For NFC3 with 3 wt% PVA, the radiopacity is similar to NFC0. It can be seen from the results that adding 6 and 9 wt% PVA caused a small decrease in the radiopaque properties of NFC; however, the values are still higher than the minimum requirements for dental restorations. The first point is that zirconia can be a good substitute for the bismuth oxide in calcium silicate composite. The second point is that poly(vinyl alcohol) has no significant effect on the radiopacity property of the prepared samples."
16,Conclusions,"In this study, the effects of poly(vinyl alcohol) on physical, mechanical, and clinical properties of a Nano Fast Cement (NFC) were investigated. The results have shown adding of the polymer affected the hydration reactions and bonding of the cement particles. The polymer also decreased the size, shape, and quantity of pores. These structural changes improved the mechanical properties of the NFC, particularly the compressive strength and workability behavior. Compared with NFC, adding an optimum amount of PVA (3 wt%) to NFC enhanced the workability and compressive strength by 5.5 times and 62%, respectively. Interestingly, this improvement in the mechanical behavior of NFC was achieved while there was a slight increase in the setting time. Finally, according to in vitro examinations, the developed nanocomposite is biocompatible, and it does not cause inflammation of body tissues."
