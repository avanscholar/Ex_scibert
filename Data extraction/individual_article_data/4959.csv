0,Introduction,"Recent years, the consumption of fossil fuels have generated a serie of environmental concerns, which seriously influenced on human life and ecological balance. Therefore, it is very urgent to develop the alternative energy sources [1–3]. Because the hydrogen energy possesses the characteristic of non-pollution and cleaning, it should be feasible in the alternative energy source [4,5]. The photocatalytic splitting water offers an efficient way for hydrogen production [6,7]. Apparently, the semiconductor photocatalyst materials are important to photocatalytic hydrogen production from water splitting. However, one of the influence factors on photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency is the high recombination rate of electrons and holes [8–10]. Fortunately, the combination of two or several semiconductor materials forming composite is an effective way to solve this problem [11–13]. So it is more significant to design the new-type compound semiconductor photocatalysts. Recently, Jo et al. reported a new direct Z-scheme photocatalysts CaIn2S4 Marigold-Flower-like/TiO2, which displayed the superior photocatalytic efficiency [14]. In this photocatalyst, the wide-band semiconductor of the lower valence band (VB) is coupled with the narrow-band semiconductor of higher conduction band (CB), which employs the conduction-band position of wide-band semiconductor being close to the valence-band position of narrow band semiconductor forming a recombination center of electrons and holes to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency [15–18]. According to this property, we designed a new Z-scheme photocatalysts Ta2O5-CaIn2S4 to more effectively carry out the photocatalytic hydrogen production from water splitting. The Ta2O5, due to its outstanding performance, has been utilized in photocatalytic hydrogen production field [19–23]. Particularly, because the band gap of Ta2O5 is much wider (Ebg = 3.9 eV) [24,25], with enough dynamic of hydrogen production and velocity of photocatalysis, so the Ta2O5 displays the higher photocatalytic efficiency of hydrogen production. And the CaIn2S4, due to the relatively negative CB (Ecb = −1.1 eV), has also been utilized in photocatalytic hydrogen production field [14,26]. Further more, because the position of CB for Ta2O5 (Ecb = −0.3 eV) is similar with the position of VB for CaIn2S4 (Evb = +0.88 eV), the electrons on the CB of Ta2O5 can well recombine with the holes on the VB of CaIn2S4. Thus, the rest of electrons and holes in the highly negative and positive potentials of the CB edges of CaIn2S4 (−1.1 eV) and VB edges of Ta2O5 (+3.6 eV) can more efficiently reduce the H+ and oxidize the sacrificial agent, respectively. In general, Ta2O5 (Ebg = 3.9 eV) can be stimulated only under ultravoilet-light (λ < 380 nm) irradiation due to it wide-band gap to carry out the photocatalytic reaction. Nevertheless, ultravoilet-light makes up only 5.0% of the total incoming solar radiation, which greatly limits its application [27,28]. The researche shows that the up-conversion luminescence agents can obviously increase the photocatalytic efficiency of wide band-gap semiconductor [29–33]. Therefore, in order to satisfy the energy requirement of Ta2O5, we employ a kind of up-conversion luminescence agent, Er3+:YAlO3, which can transform the visible-lights into the ultraviolet-lights to improve the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity for Ta2O5. In order to furtherly enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4, the reduced graphene oxide-MoSe2 (RGO-MoSe2) hybrid as the co-catalyst was introduced to this system. This co-catalyst employs the superior electro-conductivity, special surface, high adsorption and the two-dimensional nature of RGO [34,35] and the lower electric potential, higher electrical conductivity and the coverage rate of H on the edge of MoSe2 [36–38], which can fastly export electrons enhancing the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4. In this study, we reported the synthesis of Er3+:YAlO3 and Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5 compound by sol-gel process, and then the co-catalyst MoSe2-RGO hybrid was prepared by hydrothermal method. At last, the direct Z-scheme Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO photocatalyst was assembled by hydrothermal method. Afterwards, the compositions, morphologies, photocatalytic performances of the samples were investigated and the mechanism of photocatalytic splitting water under visible-light irradiation to produce hydrogen was proposed. The experiment result showed that the Z-scheme Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO photocatalysts displayed the enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency under visible-light irradiation, compared to the Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/MoSe2-RGO and CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO. Further more, the cyclic photocatalytic hydrogen production experiments demonstrated that the activity of hydrogen production for this Z-scheme Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO photocatalyst basicly remain stable in this system."

At first, Y(NO3)3 and Er(NO3)3 solutions were prepared by dissolving stoichiometric Y2O3 (0.0464 g) and Er2O3 (2.7281 g) into appropriate hot HNO3 (30 mL) solution (about 60 °C). The prepared Y(NO3)3 and Er(NO3)3 solutions were mixed with Al(NO3)3·9H2O while stirring magnetically, and the homogenous solution was obtained. Then the solid citric acid was added into the above mixture solution (mole ratio of citric acid: metal ion is 3:1). The solution was further stirred and heated at 50–60 °C until the transparent sol was successfully formed. Afterwards, the transparent sol was heated at 80 °C for 24 h and became the gel. After being cooled in the air, the gel was ground into fine homogeneous powders. Subsequently, in order to remove residual organic components and nitrate ions the particles were calcined at 1100 °C for 2.0 h. At last, the sintered substance was taken out of the muffle furnace and allowed to cool down to the room temperature in atmosphere. Then, the desired white Er3+:YAlO3 powders were obtained."
4,Preparation of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5 composite,"2.3 Preparation of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5 composite The Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5 coated samples were prepared by sol-gel process. At first, the transparent TaCl5 solution was obtained by dissolving the required amount of TaCl5 in absolute alcohol then adding the nano-sized up-conversion luminescence agent (Er3+:YAlO3) particles. The citric acid as chelating agent of tantalum ions, in which the molar ratio of tantalum ions to citric acid was 1: 2, was dissolved in a suitable amount of ethanol-water (with a volume ratio of Ethanol: H2O = 9: 1). The obtained citric acid solution was slowly mixed with the TaCl5 solution. Then a reasonable quantity of polyethylene glycol as crosslinker was added. After continuous stirring for 2.0 h, the highly transparent sol was formed and heated at 80 °C in a water bath to obtain the corresponding gel. Afterwards, the transparent gel was dried at 110 °C for 12 h. Finally, after fully grinding and calcining at 500 °C for 5.0 h in air, the catalyst Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5 compound was obtained."
5,Preparation of MoSe2-RGO,"2.4 Preparation of MoSe2-RGO The MoSe2-RGO was prepared by simple hydrothermal method. 1.0 mmol Na2MoO4·2H2O was dissolved in 50 mL distilled water and then 0.0134 g graphene oxide (5.0 wt% in MoSe2-RGO) was added under ultrasonic irradiation at room temperature until forming a homogeneous solution. In another flask, 2.0 mmol Se powder was disperse in 10 mL hydrazine hydrate solution. Immediately, the color of obtained solution transformed from colorlessness to dark brown and kept invariability at least for one day. Then the obtained solution was added to Na2MoO4 and RGO oxide solution. Then the color of mixture changed into orange-red. The mixture was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave heated at 200 °C for 10 h. After cooling to room temperature naturally, the black sediments were gathered by centrifugation, washed with redistilled water and ethyl alcohol at least four times. Finally, the obtained substance was annealed at 200 °C in vacuum atmosphere for 12 h to attain final products."
6,Preparation of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/MoSe2-RGO,"2.5 Preparation of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/MoSe2-RGO Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/MoSe2-RGO catalysts were prepared through the simple hydrothermal method. The Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5 coated compound and MoSe2-RGO powders, whose mass ratio of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5 and MoSe2-RGO were adopted as 99.25: 0.75, were added into a 200 mL beaker filled with 20 mL redistilled water, dispersed by ultrasound (frequency: 80 kHz, output power: 50 W) for 30 min. Then the 10 mL C2H5OH was added to the suspension, stirring for 1.0 min. Then the mixture was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave heated at 200 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature naturally, the sediments were washed with redistilled water for three times. Finally, the obtained substance was dried at 110 °C in vacuum atmosphere to attain final products."

Afterwards, the Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5 was added into above reaction mixture and stirred for 30 min at room temperature. Then, the reaction mixture was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 393 K for 24 h. After cooling naturally to room temperature, the precipitate was gathered by centrifugation, washed with redistilled water and ethyl alcohol at least four times. The obtained substance was dried at 343 K in vacuum atmosphere to attain final products."
9,Analytical method,"2.8 Analytical method The prepared Er3+:YAlO3, Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5, MoSe2-RGO, Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/MoSe2-RGO, CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO and Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (D-8, Bruker-axs, Germany) using Ni filtered Cu Kα radiation in the range of 2θ from 10° to 70°, scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-5610LV, Hitachi Corporation, Japan), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100, Hitachi Corporation, Japan) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB-250, Thermal VG Corporation, USA). The UV–vis absorption spectra and photoluminescence spectra of Er3+:YAlO3 were measured by using UV–vis spectrograph (UV-2450, Shimadzu, Japan) and photoluminescence spectrograph (RF-5301PC, Shimadzu, Japan). Energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS, JEOL JSM-5610LV, Hitachi Corporation, Japan) and the Raman spectra were recorded on a LabRAM HR spectrom-eter with a laser excitation of 532 nm (HORIBA, Jobin Yvon, France)."
10,Visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production experimental,"2.9 Visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production experimental The experiments of photocatalytic splitting water for hydrogen production were conducted in a 500 mL Pyrex reactor. The headspace of the reactor connected with an inverted buret to measure the produced hydrogen gas, which is filled with methanol-water solution at atmospheric pressure. In the reactions of photocatalytic splitting water for hydrogen production, a needed amount of photocatalysts (250 mg) were dispersed in methanol-water solution (10.0 wt %) under continuous stirring. After purging the suspensions by argon flow for at least 30 min to wipe out dissolved air, the suspensions were irradiated for 5.0 h using a 300 W xenon lamp (Microsolar300, Beijing perfectlight science and technology Ltd, China). The irradiation wavelength was controlled by a combination of a cold mirror (CM-1) and a water filter (350 < λ < 800 nm). For visible-light irradiation, a cut filter (L42) was fitted to the aforementioned light source (400 < λ < 800 nm). The produced hydrogen was confirmed by the gas chromatograph (GC-8A, MS-5A column, TCD, Ar Carrier, Shimadazu, Japan)."
11,Results and discussion,
12,"XRD, SEM, TEM, EDS, Raman and XPS analyses","3.1 XRD, SEM, TEM, EDS, Raman and XPS analyses Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of Er3+:YAlO3 (a), Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5 (b), MoSe2-RGO (c), Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/MoSe2-RGO (d), CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO (e) and Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO (f). From Fig. 1(a), it can be found that the characteristic diffraction peaks of 2θ = 18.15°, 33.50°, 41.50°, 46.62° and 55.12° are similar to that of the standard YAlO3 card (JCPDS-70.1677). It demonstrated that we had well synthesized the YAlO3, in which the Er3+ ions entered the crystal lattice, taking the place of the partial Y3+ ion. Fig. 1(c) displays the XRD patterns of MoSe2-RGO hybrid and the main peaks can be indexed with the standard diffraction data of MoSe2 nanosheets (JCPDS-00-05101426). And that, the diffraction peak of 2θ = 26.52° can prove the existence of RGO. Fig. 1(d) shows the XRD patterns of CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO and it can be found that the characteristic diffraction peaks appear at 2θ = 14.51°, 23.34°, 27.45°, 28.71°, 33.42°, 43.94°, 48.01°, 56.96°, 59.71° and 66.94°. It proves that the CaIn2S4 has been synthesized [14]. The characteristic peaks of MoSe2-RGO can hardly be found in Fig. 1(d), since the amount of MoSe2-RGO in the compounds is too low. As shown in Fig. 1(b, e and f), we can found that the diffraction peaks of Ta2O5 are nearly invisible in these XRD patterns and the characteristic diffraction peaks of Er3+:YAlO3 such as 2θ = 18.15°, 33.50°, 41.50°, 46.62° and 55.12°, 43.94° are present. Thus, it can prove that the Ta2O5 is essentially amorphous and well synthesized [19]. Moreover, in Fig. 1(f), the diffraction peaks of CaIn2S4 exist at diffraction angles at 2θ = 27.45°, 28.71°, 46.62°, 56.96° and 59.71°. The peaks of MoSe2-RGO in Fig. 1(f) are similar to that of peaks in Fig. 1(d) and hardly be found, which indicates that the amount of MoSe2-RGO in the compounds is not enough to generate the obvious characteristic peaks in XRD patterns. The SEM images of Er3+:YAlO3 (a), Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5 (b), MoSe2-RGO (c), Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/MoSe2-RGO (d), CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO (e) and Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO (f) were showed in Fig. 2 . As clearly shown in Fig. 2(a), the up-conversion luminescence agent, Er3+:YAlO3, presents the spherical particles with 30–50 nm size. In Fig. 2(b), it can be seen that a lot of solid particles without definite shape are Ta2O5 which are attached with many spherical particles with 30–50 nm size. Fig. 2(c) shows that the wrinkled nanosheets are RGO and MoSe2 particles are attached on the surface of RGO nanosheets. The particle size of MoSe2 is about 30 nm and it becomes much small after fully dispersed as displayed in TEM. The CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO is showed in Fig. 2(d). It can be found that the particles with the sizes about 60 nm are CaIn2S4 attached on the surface of RGO and the particles with slightly little size are MoSe2 also on the surface of RGO. Fig. 2(f) presents the images of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO, each component of sample gets together, which may be because the RGO with some wrinkles wrap them. On the surface of RGO, the particles whose size is about 60 nm are CaIn2S4. The Ta2O5 particles attached with the Er3+:YAlO3 with the particle size about 30–50 nm successfully couple with the CaIn2S4 particles. And then, there are a lot of MoSe2 particles on the surface of RGO. So it can be proved that the photocatalysts Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO has successfully been prepared. For comparison, the Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/MoSe2-RGO image is also showed in Fig. 2(e). The smaller particles are Er3+:YAlO3 on the Ta2O5. To further obtain the microscopic morphology and structure information, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO has been performed. Fig. 3 gives an overview of a typical TEM image of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO. The CaIn2S4 and MoSe2 particles can be obviously found, which dispersed on the RGO in Fig. 3. The partial images exhibit fringes with lattice space of crystallite is 0.270 nm, which correspond to the (400) plane of CaIn2S4. In addition, it can be seen that Er3+:YAlO3 particles closely adhered to the Ta2O5, resulting in intimate contact, which was beneficial for activating Ta2O5 to produce photogenerated electron-hole (e– - h+) pairs. The HRTEM images are local enlargement of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO sample. The phase with the lattice fringes (0.398 nm) could be observed, which corresponded to the (001) plane of Ta2O5 and the lattice space of crystallite is 0.183 nm, which agreed well the (102) plane of YAlO3. Besides, the spherical MoSe2 are some tiny particles (10 nm < diameter < 5 nm), which as co-catalysts are indeed dispersed randomly on the surface of RGO. Therefore, the HRTEM micrographs demonstrate the existence of MoSe2 and RGO phase not detectable by XRD measurements. The chemical composition of the Er3+:YAlO3 (a), Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5 (b), MoSe2-RGO (c), CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO (d), Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/MoSe2-RGO (e) and Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO (f) were measured by EDS. In Fig. 4 (a), the determined result reveals that the Er3+:YAlO3 contains Er, Y, Al and O elements without any impurity. From Fig. 4(b) and (c), it can be confirmed that the strong peaks of O, Ta, Mo and Se atoms belong to the Ta2O5 and MoSe2, respectively. Based on Fig. 4(d), the peaks of Ca, In and S elements can be clearly observed, which belong to the CaIn2S4 nanoparticles. In addition, the signal peaks of all existing elements in EDS spectra (Fig. 4 (e and f)) can further confirm the formation of Er3+:YAlO3, Ta2O5, CaIn2S4 and MoSe2-RGO in the composites. The atomic ratios of prepared Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO in EDS spectra are basically the same as those given in the preparation. It demonstrates that the Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO has successfully been prepared. Raman spectroscopy is a powerful technique for evaluating the structural properties of grapheme. In order to confirm the existence of RGO, the special D band (k point phonons of A1g symmetric vibrational mode) and G band (E2g vibrational mode of sp2 bonded carbon atoms) of RGO were detected by Raman spectroscopy. In Fig. 5 , the Raman spectrum of the Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO exhibits two prominent peaks at 1393 cm−1 and 1621 cm−1, attributing to the typical D and G bands of RGO, respectively. In addition, it is also displayed that two main peaks appear at 721 cm−1 and 848 cm−1, corresponding to the vibration spectrum of Ta2O5 [34,35]. The coupled mode indicates that the bands at 721 cm−1 and 848 cm−1 mainly involve the stretching vibration of various Ta-O-Ta bonds [34,35]. Based on the above considerations, it can be confirmed that RGO and Ta2O5 exist in Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO composites. The XPS spectra of the Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO has been showed in Fig. 6 . From Fig. 6(o), it can be confirmed that this photocatalyst contains Ta, Ca, In, S, Er, Y, Al, O, C, Mo and Se elements and there are no other impurity peaks. It shows that the purity of obtained material Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO is relatively high. Specifically, Fig. 6(a) shows the peak of Er (4d) positioned at 167.3 eV which is assigned to the Er (4d5/2), demonstrating that the valence of Er is three. Fig. 6(b) displays the Y (3d) with peaks of 156.4 eV (3d5/2) and 159.4 eV (3d3/2), demonstrating that the valence of Y is also three. In Fig. 6(c) the peak at 74.35 eV assigned to the Al (2p), demonstrating that the valence of Al is three. Further more, according to Fig. 6(k), the peak of 532.7 eV is the O (1s), indicating that the valence of O is two. So Fig. 6(a, b, c and k) prove that the up-conversion luminescence agent Er3+:YAlO3 has been synthesized. Fig. 6 (d) shows the characteristic peaks of Ta (24.5 eV (4f7/2) and 26.5 eV (4f5/2)), demonstrating that the valence of Ta is five. From Fig. 6(e–g), the characteristic peaks of Ca2+ (346.7 eV (2p3/2) and 350.5 eV (2p1/2)), In3+ (446.7 eV (3d5/2) and 454.5 eV (3d3/2)) and S2− (168.5 eV (2p1/2)) indicate that the CaIn2S4 has been synthesized. Fig. 6(h–j) show the XPS of Mo, Se and C in co-catalyst MoSe2-RGO. Fig. 6(h and i) shows the characteristic peaks of Mo4+ (229.5 eV (3d5/2) and 230.8 eV (3d3/2)) and Se2+ (60.6 eV (3d5/2) and 61.6 eV (3d3/2)). And then, the characteristic peaks at 284.6 eV assigned to the C (1s) proves the reduction of GO to graphene."
13,UV–vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra of up-conversion luminescence agent (Er3+:YAlO3),"3.2 UV–vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra of up-conversion luminescence agent (Er3+:YAlO3) In order to prove the up-conversion luminescence properties of Er3+:YAlO3, the UV–vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra were measured as displayed in Fig. 7 . From Fig. 7(a), it can be obviously seen that there are several typical absorption peaks located in 400–700 nm visible-light region. It indicates that the prepared Er3+:YAlO3 is able to absorb the visible-lights. In the photoluminescence spectra of Er3+:YAlO3, when the 452 nm and 651 nm are used as excitation wavelengths, respectively, some emission peaks can conspicuously be found in the ultraviolet-light region (220–350 nm) as shown in Fig. 7(b and c). There are many absorption peaks for Er3+:YAlO3 displayed in Fig. 7(a), which heralds that the solar light with continuous spectrum can be fully utilized as illumination source. In this work, we just randomly choose two absorption peaks at 452 nm and 651 nm as excitation wavelengths. So, it can be proved that the Er3+:YAlO3 can emit the high-energy ultraviolet-light by absorbing low-energy visible-light. The ultraviolet-light generated from Er3+:YAlO3 can activate Ta2O5 to effectively perform the photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction."
14,Activity of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO in visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production,"3.3 Activity of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO in visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production The activity of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO as Z-scheme photocatalyst in visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production was displayed in Fig. 8 . In order to demonstrate the enhancement, the visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production activities of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/MoSe2-RGO, CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO and CaIn2S4/MoSe2 were also investigated. For these four photocatalysts, it can be found that, along with the extension of visible-light irradiation time, the hydrogen yields increase gradually. However, compared to the hydrogen yields of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/MoSe2-RGO, CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO and CaIn2S4/MoSe2, the hydrogen yields of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO is the highest. It is because that the Ta2O5 is well coupled with CaIn2S4 forming a Z-scheme photocatalyst. The electrons of CB(Ta2O5) are recombined with the holes of VB(CaIn2S4). The remainder electrons in highly negative CB(CaIn2S4) can more efficiently reduce the H+ to generate H2, and the remainder holes in highly positive VB(Ta2O5) can more well oxidize the sacrificial agent. The hydrogen yields of CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO and MoSe2-RGO are much less than that of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/MoSe2-RGO because the VB position of CaIn2S4 is low, leading to its low oxidizability of the holes and also the CaIn2S4 as photocatalyst is most likely to be photocorrosion."
15,The stability of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO for photocatalytic hydrogen production,"3.4 The stability of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO for photocatalytic hydrogen production It is worth pointing out that the reusability for any photocatalyst is a crucial factor for the practical applications. To confirm the reusability of the obtained photocatalyst, five circulating run experiments were examined for Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible-light irradiation (as shown in Fig. 9 ). In Fig. 9, it can be found that there is no significant decrease in the hydrogen production after every eight hours. That is, the hydrogen production has only a slight decrease as the used times increase. Over all, the Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO nanocomposite can be effectively recycled for five repetitive cycles without an apparent deactivation in its visible-light photocatalytic activity, which demonstrates its great potential as an efficient and reusable photocatalytic material."
16,Possible visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production mechanism for Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO,"3.5 Possible visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production mechanism for Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO In Fig. 10 , on the basis of up-conversion luminescence feature of Er3+:YAlO3 a tentative mechanism for visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution using Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO catalyst was proposed. In Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO photocatalytic hydrogen evolution system, the Er3+:YAlO3 as up-conversion luminescence agent can absorb low-energy visible-light, and then emit high-energy ultravoilet-light, which satisfies the energy requirements of wide band-gap semiconductor catalysts. Ta2O5 is a wide-band gap semiconductor photocatalyst, which can play an important role in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. When Ta2O5 combine with up-conversion luminescence agent (Er3+:YAlO3), it can effectively enhancing of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. And the CaIn2S4, due to the relatively negative CB (Ecb = −1.1 eV), has been utilized in photocatalytic hydrogen production field. Particularly, when Ta2O5 is combined with CaIn2S4, the composite can effectively suppress the recombination of the photo-generated electron (e−)-hole (h+) pairs. Furthermore, the graphene oxide (RGO)-MoSe2 (RGO-MoSe2) hybrid as a conduction band co-catalyst in the composite can efficiently export electrons enhancing the photocatalytic hydrogen production of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4. The Er3+:YAlO3 as an up-conversion luminescence agent can effectively emit ultraviolet-light in the region of 220–350 nm pumped by a 542 nm and 651 nm. Moreover, some groups have also researched the up-conversion luminescent characteristics of Er3+:YAlO3, and the mechanisms are also discussed in detail [29,32]. When the Er3+:YAlO3 are pumped by a 486.5 nm and 542.4 nm, the up-conversion signals can be observed at 318.7 nm and 320.1 nm. Besides, when the excitation wave length is controlled at 652.2 nm (or 657.8 nm), the signals of 326–342 nm and 354–359 nm are also found. The up-conversion phenomenon of Er3+ in Er3+:YAlO3 excited by F9/2 has been investigated by ETU and ESA processes [39,40]. According to the energy level data, the 326–342 nm in ultraviolet emission is from 2H9/2 to 4I13/2 and the 354–359 nm in ultraviolet emission from 4D5/2 to 4I11/2 [41]. If the visible-light region (400–800 nm) in solar light is employed as excitation source, the up-conversion process may easily take place in Er3+:YAlO3 crystals. Just as Fig. 7 described, Ta2O5 can be activated by enough energy generated from up-conversion luminescence agent, Er3+:YAlO3, via absorbing the visible-light in sunlight and emitting ultraviolet-light. Under the irradiation of ultraviolet-light emitted by up-conversion luminescence agent, the electrons in the VB leap into the CB of Ta2O5, creating photogenerated electrons in the CB and photogenerated holes in the VB, simultaneously. Similarly, under the irradiation of visible-light, the electrons in the VB leap into the CB of CaIn2S4, creating photogenerated electrons in the CB and photogenerated holes in the VB. The position of CB for Ta2O5 (Ecb = −0.3 eV) is similar with the position of VB for CaIn2S4 (Evb = +0.88 eV), the electrons on the CB of Ta2O5 can well recombine with the holes on the VB of CaIn2S4 forming a recombination center. The rest of photogenerated electrons in the highly negative CB of CaIn2S4 can transfer onto the RGO surface and then be accepted by MoSe2 nanoparticles as active sites for hydrogen production. That is, the photogenerated electrons transfer from the CB of CaIn2S4 to MoSe2 nanosheets due to the presence of RGO sheets acted as electron-transporting bridge and then the photogenerated electrons can well reduce the H+ ions at the edges of MoSe2 to produce hydrogen. The rest of photogenerated holes in the highly positive potentials of the VB of Ta2O5 can more efficiently oxidize the sacrificial agent (methanal) forming methanoic acid. Detailed hydrogen generation processes are as shown in (0)–(8): (0) hν (visible-light) + [Er3+:YAlO3] → [Er3+:YAlO3]* (1) [Er3+:YAlO3]* → [Er3+:YAlO3] + hν (ultravoilet-light) (2) Ta2O5 + hν (ultravoilet-light)→e− CB (Ta2O5) + h+ VB (Ta2O5) (3) CaIn2S4 + hν (visible-light)→e− CB (CaIn2S4) + h+ VB (CaIn2S4) (4) e− CB (Ta2O5) + h+ VB (CaIn2S4) → hν or hot (in the assumed recombination center) (5) e− CB (CaIn2S4) + RGO-MoSe2 → (e−) RGO-MoSe2 (6) (e−) RGO-MoSe2 → RGO-MoSe2 (e−) (7) 2H+ + 2 RGO-MoSe2 (e−) → 2 RGO-MoSe2 + H2 (8) R + h+ VB (Ta2O5) → R+ Based on the above analysis, it can be believed that the presences of up-conversion luminescence agent (Er3+:YAlO3) and co-catalytic (MoSe2-RGO) enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of Ta2O5-CaIn2S4 composite."
17,Conclusions,"In summary, we have successfully synthesized an effective up-conversion luminescence agent, Er3+:YAlO3, and prepared the Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4 composite and MoSe2-RGO as a co-catalyst. At last, a new Z-scheme Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO photocatalyst was prepared for visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production. The photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of Ta2O5-CaIn2S4 composite by splitting methanol aqueous solution can be immensely enhanced by adding Er3+:YAlO3 as up-conversion luminescence agent and MoSe2-RGO as co-catalyst. Also, the prepared Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO photocatalysts with 50:100 mass ratio of Er3+:YAlO3 to Ta2O5, 1:1 mass ratio of Ta2O5 to CaIn2S4 and 1.0 wt% MoSe2-RGO loading display a highest amount of evolved hydrogen (1050 μmol g−1) within 5.0 h visible-light irradiation. Furthermore, the cyclic photocatalytic hydrogen production experiments demonstrated that the activity of hydrogen production for this Z-scheme Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-CaIn2S4/MoSe2-RGO photocatalyst basicly remain stable in five-times loops. Perhaps, it provides a strategy for large-sale hydrogen production using solar energy in the future."
