0,Introduction,"The reduction of the carbonyl moiety to an alcohol via hydrogenation is a key step in the industrial synthesis of fine chemicals, leading to molecules with hydroxyl functionalities [1]. Traditionally, a stoichiometric amount of metal hydrides (e.g., NaBH4, boranes, and LiAlH-(OR)3) were used to realize such a transformation with the generation of a large amount of undesirable waste [2]. Since several decades, transition metal-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation reactions of ketones and aldehydes with HCOOM (M = Na, NH4, H) or isopropanol have been developed [3]. Nevertheless, either a certain pH range is necessary, or the generation of inorganic salt by-products is inevitable. Along with increasing environmental awareness, the hydrogenation of C=O bonds catalyzed with H2 gas as a clean and green reagent by transition metal complexes has been well explored and applied as the most useful catalytic method of hydrogenation of ketones and aldehydes for the production of alcohols due to the easy manipulations, high reaction activities, and wide substrate scope. To date, a number of transition metal catalysts (Ru, Rh, Ir, Fe, Co, and Mn) have been developed for hydrogenation reactions of ketones and aldehydes [4]. However, most systems are based on a base and high-pressure H2 gas, and organic solvents are required for promoting the reduction smoothly. In the presence of a base, self-aldol side reactions unavoidably occurred, and the use of high-pressure H2 gas needs specialized experimental setup for safety. More importantly, given that organic solvents are used in vast quantities as compared to reactants, solvents have been the focus of environmental concerns. Using green solvents is urgent because of the toxicity and unfriendly environment of organic solvents. Herein, water is attracting more and more interest from both industrial and academic perspectives as a replacement for organic solvents. Catalytic reactions in water mediated by aquo-soluble coordination compounds could provide an interesting solution to most of the problems found in the catalytic synthesis of organic solvents [5]. But as far as we know, only two catalysts were reported, which hydrogenate aldehydes or ketones under 1 atm H2 pressure and base-free conditions. In 2014, Do and co-workers developed an iridium catalyst for the hydrogenation of aldehydes and ketones under 1 atm H2 without a base in mixed solvents of t-BuOH/H2O (1:9), in which eight examples were reported with high yields for 24 h under room temperature (Scheme 1 , a) [6]. Additionally, Choudhury and co-workers reported an iridium-based catalyst for hydrogenation of aldehydes for general applicability under atmospheric-pressure H2 gas and base-free conditions in H2O or ethanol/H2O (Scheme 1, b) [7]. The catalytic reaction can be utilized only for the hydrogenation of aldehydes, but not for the hydrogenation of ketones. Thus, developing a method for highly efficient catalytic hydrogenation of aldehydes, as well as ketones, without a base in pure water under ambient-pressure H2 gas is still an issue with great challenge. In recent years, Fujita, Yamaguchi, and co-workers have previously reported a series of metal–ligand bifunctional Cp*Ir complexes, which bear functional ligands with an α-hydroxypyridine or bipyridonate skeleton [8]. These catalysts exhibit high catalytic activity for borrowing-hydrogen reactions. On the basis of previous findings, we reported the synthesis of α-alkylated ketones via tandem acceptorless dehydrogenation/α-alkylation from secondary and primary alcohols [9a], the dehydrogenative cyclization for the construction of quinazolinones from o-aminobenzyl alcohols with ketones [9b], and the transfer hydrogenation of aldehydes and ketones with isopropanol under neutral conditions [9c] by using [Cp*Ir(2,2′-bpyO)(H2O)] or [Cp*Ir(6,6′-(OH)2–2,2′-bpy)(H2O)][OTf]2. More recently, we have developed the catalyst [Cp*Ir(2,2′-bpyO)(H2O)] for the hydrogenation of ketones and aldehydes under 1 atm H2 in tert-amyl alcohol [10]. As part of our ongoing interest in hydrogenation of ketones and aldehydes, we herein report a highly efficient and general catalyst for the hydrogenation of ketones and aldehydes without a base under 1 atm H2 at 30 °C by a water-soluble Iridium complex [Cp*Ir(2,2′-bpyO)(OH)][Na] in water (Scheme 1, c)."
1,Results and discussion,"Exploring the best reaction conditions for the hydrogenation reaction, our initial catalytic investigations were carried out using the hydrogenation of acetophenone (1a) as a benchmark reaction (Table 1 ). With a series of water-soluble catalysts in hand, we next examined the catalytic activity for the hydrogenation reaction of acetophenone (1a) in H2O for 12 h at 30 °C. Disappointingly, conducting this reaction in the presence of [Cp*Ir(H2O)3][OTf]2 (cat. 1), [Cp*Ir(NH2)3]Cl2 (cat. 2), [Cp*Ir(bpy)(H2O)][OTf]2 (cat. 3), [Cp*Ir(6,6′-(OMe)2bpy)(H2O)][OTf]2 (cat. 4) resulted in only ≤ 12% yield of the desired product. When [Cp*Ir(6,6′-(OH)2–2,2′-bpy)(H2O)][OTf]2 (cat. 5) was texted bearing a functional bihydroxypyridine under same conditions, we obtained the 1-phenylethanol (2a) in 80% yield. Interestingly, a higher yield of 1-phenylethanol (2a) was obtained when using [Cp*Ir(2,2′-bpyO)(OH)][Na] (cat. 6) with the bis-pyridonate ligand, and 95% yield was obtained after filtration through a pad of silica gel. It was apparent that the bis-hydroxypyridine or bis-pyridonate ligand is indispensable for high catalytic performance. The catalytic activity of cat. 6 with the bis-pyridonate ligand was higher than cat. 5 bearing the bis-hydroxypyridine ligand under the same conditions. This was probably because the cat. 5 must go through producing a monocationic unsaturated species intermediate having a 2-pyridonate-based ligand in the process of hydrogenation. However, analogous water-soluble catalysts [Cp*Rh(6,6′-(OH)2–2,2′-bpy)(H2O)][OTf]2 (cat. 7) and [(p-cymene)Ru(6,6′-(OH)2–2,2′-bpy)(H2O)][OTf]2 (cat. 8) showed a lower activity than cat. 6. Additionally, the hydrogenation reaction also proceeded with lower amounts of the catalyst (0.50 mol %, cat. 6), giving a slightly lower yield. After establishing optimal reaction parameters (1 mol% cat. 6, 1 atm H2, 1 mL H2O, 30 °C, 12 h), the hydrogenation of various ketones was studied (Table 2 ). The substituted 1-phenethyl alcohol derivatives such as 1-(o-tolyl)ethanol (2b), 1-(p-tolyl)ethanol (2c), 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethanol (2d), and 1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanol (2e), carrying electron-donating groups were isolated in 89–92% yields. Similarly, the presence of one or two halogen atoms (fluorine, chlorine, or bromine) at the aromatic ring led to good conversion, and the corresponding products (2f-2j) were obtained with 86–96% yields. When 4-hydroxyacetophenone (1k) and methyl-4-(1-hydroxyethyl)benzoate (1l) were used as the substrates, the desired products 2k and 2l were obtained in 91% and 94% yields. Reactions with strong electron-withdrawing substituents, such as trifluoromethoxy, nitro, and cyan groups afforded the desired products 2m-2o in 93–96% yields. When 2-acetylpyridine (1p) and 2-acetonaphthone (2q) were examined, the desired products were obtained in good yields. Interestingly, when benzalacetone (1r) was subjected to the reaction under standard conditions, only the C=O bond was selectively hydrogenated with retaining C=C bond and the desired product 2r was obtained in 96% yield. In addition, nonmethyl ketone (1s) was proven to be a suitable substrate, and the desired product 2s was obtained in 94% yield. It was possible that due to the steric hinerance, the yields of 2-methyl-1-phenyl-1-propanol (2t) and 2,2-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1-propanol (2u) were slowly depressed. Finally, aliphatic ketones, including cyclohexanone (1v) and octanone (1w), were also evaluated, which provided the corresponding products 2v and 2w in 92% and 85% yields, respectively. Next, we studied the general applicability of this procedure for the hydrogenation of aldehydes, and the results were listed in Table 3 . Overall, cat. 6 was efficient for the hydrogenation of differently functionalized aromatic aldehydes, as well as heterocyclic aromatic substrates and aliphatic aldehydes. Reactions of benzaldehyde (3a) and the electron-donating aromatic aldehydes afforded the desired products 4a-4d in 93–96% yields. Similarly, the electron-poor (fluorine, chlorine, and bromine) benzaldehydes were proved to be the ideal substrates to deliver products 4e-4h in 90–95% yields. 4-Hydroxybenzaldehyde (3i) and methyl-4-formylbenzoate (3j) were proved suitable substrates, giving the corresponding products 4i and 4j in 93% and 95% yields. When benzaldehydes with a strong electron-withdrawing group, 4-nitrobenzaldehyde (3k) and 4-cyanobenzaldehyde (3l) were used as the substrates and the desired products were obtained in 93% and 95% yields. For 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde (3m) and 2-naphthaldehyde (3n), the corresponding products 4m and 4n were isolated in 94 and 95% yields, respectively. When benzenepropanal (3o) was used, the desired alcohol 4o was obtained in 94%. It is important to note that various aliphatic aldehydes (3p and 3q), including cyclic and linear aliphatic aldehydes, were tolerated, giving 90% and 93% yields of the corresponding alcohols. Encouraged by the above result, we next sought to the hydrogenation of a series of unsaturated aldehydes under standard conditions (Table 4 ). As we expected, the reaction with cinnamyl aldehyde (5a) afforded the desired product 6a in 97% yield. It was found that parasubstituted substrates with incorporation of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents, such as Me-, MeO-, and Cl-, reacted efficiently with H2 to produce the desired products 6b-6d in 90–93% yields. High catalytic activities were also observed when cinnamaldehydes bearing a substituent on the α-position were used, and the desired products 6e-6g were obtained in good to excellent yields. Particularly, the industrially important perillyl alcohol (6h) was also obtained in 91% yields. Moreover, cyclohex-3-enecarbaldehyde (5i) was reduced to 3-cyclohexene -1- methanol (6i), which was an important compound for the fragrance industry, in good yield of 93%. In order to test the utility of this strategy, a 10 mmol gram-scale reaction was conducted (Scheme 2 ). The hydrogenation reaction of acetophenone (1a) also performed very well in H2O with a smaller amount of solvent and catalyst. To our delight, the product 2a was obtained using a simple separation from the mixture without another organic solvent, giving the product in a higher yield compared to the optimal benchmark reaction (Table, entry 6), which proved to be a green and significant potential protocol with a wide range of applications in industry. Based on the previous reports by Fujita and Yamaguchi [8d,8e,11,12a] as well as our works [9c,12b], a possible mechanism for the hydrogenation reaction of acetophenone (1a) was shown in Scheme 3 . Initially, the anionic iridium hydride species A was generated via the reaction of cat. 6 with H2. Protonation of the bipyridonate ligand by water would give neutral hydride species B. Then, the simultaneous transfer of the hydride on iridium with the hydroxyl proton on the functional ligand in iridium species B to C=O bond of acetophenone (1a), which would be subjected to the formation of the corresponding alcohol 2a to generate the unsaturated species C. Finally, cat. 6 would be regenerated by the reaction of C with a hydroxide anion [13]."
2,Conclusions,"In summary, we have demonstrated that the water-soluble Iridium complex [Cp*Ir(2,2′-bpyO)(OH)][Na] with a functional bipyridonate ligand is a highly active and general catalyst for the hydrogenation of ketones, aldehydes, and unsaturated aldehydes with H2 gas at normal temperature and atmospheric pressure in water. Of significant practical importance was that the catalyst tolerated aromatic, heteroaromatic, and aliphatic aldehydes or ketones as well as a range of synthetically useful functional groups including alkyl groups, alkoxy groups, halogens, nitro groups, esters, and olefins. Moreover, high yields, up to 97%, were observed under the optimal conditions. Overall, this water-soluble Iridium complex represented a catalyst for the hydrogenation of ketones and aldehydes with higher efficiency, higher activity, and more environmental friendliness to date. Importantly, the gram-scale experiment has been successfully conducted, which might indicate that this strategy has more applications in the future."

4,"General procedure for catalytic hydrogenation of ketones, aldehydes or unsaturated aldehydes","4.1 General procedure for catalytic hydrogenation of ketones, aldehydes or unsaturated aldehydes To an oven-dried 5 mL round-bottom flask were added ketones or aldehydes or unsaturated aldehydes (1 mmol), cat. 6 (5.5 mg, 1 mol %) and H2O (1 mL). Next, vacuum was applied to the flask followed by filling with H2 gas and keeping the flask attached to a balloon filled with H2 gas. The mixture was heated at 30 °C for 12 h. After completion of the reaction, the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (5 mL × 3). Then, the ethyl acetate layers were combined, dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated by evaporation under reduced pressure. The alcohols were isolated and purified by filtering a hexanes/ethyl acetate (8:1) solution of the crude product through a pad of silica gel. Then the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to afford the corresponding products. The purity of alcohol products was assessed using 1H NMR spectroscopy."
5,Procedure for gram-scale synthesis of 2a [21],"4.2 Procedure for gram-scale synthesis of 2a [21] 1a (1.2 g, 10 mmol), cat. 6 (27.5 mg, 0.5 mol %) and H2O (5 mL) were added into an oven-dried 10 mL round-bottom flask with a stirrer. Next, vacuum was applied to the flask followed by filling with H2 gas and keeping the flask attached to a balloon filled with H2 gas. The mixture was heated at 30 °C for 12 h. After completion of the reaction, the product 2a could be obtained through the separation of organic phase and aqueous phase. The conversion rate of 1a was proved to be 100% by 1H NMR. And finally, a minimum supply of water was removed under reduced pressure using a rotary to give 2a (1.17 g) in 96% yield."
