0,Introduction,"Boswellia is a genus of anacanthous shrub or small and medium-sized arbor belonging to family of Burseraceae, which is mainly distributed in India and the coast of the Red Sea, such as South Arabia, tropical region of northeast Africa, Northeast Tanzania, Madagascar, and so on [1–3]. The genus Boswellia mainly comprises ten more species, including Boswellia carterii Birdw., Boswellia bhau-da jiana, Boswellia serrata, Boswellia papyrifera, Boswellia frereana, Boswellia rivae, Boswellia neglecta, Boswellia globosa, Boswellia pirottae, Boswellia ogadensis, and Boswellia microphylla, most of which can secrete gum resin by the bark [4–9]. Especially, the gum resin produced by the bark of Boswellia carterii Birdw. is reported and used as olibanum in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) [10], which is widely used for multiple indications, such as heart pain, ulcerative carbuncle, traumatic injury, painful menstruation, rheumatism, and so on. The medicinal applications are connected with the chemical constituents contained in the gum resin of B. carterii inclusive mainly of mono-, di- and tri-terpenoids [11–13]. Furthermore, cembrane-type diterpenoids characterized by a particular 14-membered carbocycle are the significant members, which exhibit a wide variety of activities, including anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antitumor, and so on [14–16]. The characteristic 14-membered macrocyclic structures and wide range of bioactivities of cembrane-type diterpenoids drew our interest in the gum resin of B. carterii. With the purpose of structurally novel and diversely bioactive cembrane-type diterpenoids, an investigation for the cembranoid constituents from the gum resin of B. carterii was conducted, leading to the identification of five new cembrane-type diterpenoid alcohols (1–5) (Fig. 1 ), all of which were characterized by one epoxy ring, two hydroxy groups and two double bonds. Herein, the isolation, structural determination, anti-inflammatory effects, and hepatoprotective effects for the five new cembranoid alcohols are described."

2,General experimental procedures,"2.1 General experimental procedures Optical rotations and IR spectra were conducted with a SGW-531 digital polarimeter and a Nicolet 5700 spectrometer. HRESIMS analysis was performed by a Bruker Impact II mass spectrometer. NMR experiments were recorded by a BURKER 400 NMR spectrometer with CDCl3 being as the test solvent. Column chromatography was performed using packing materials of silica gel (200–300 mesh) and reversed-phase C18 (60 μm, YMC Co., Ltd., Japan). Preparative HPLC chromatography was carried out by a Shimadzu LC-6 CE gradient system equipped with a reversed-phase C18 column (YMC-Pack ODS-AU 20 × 250 mm, 10 μm), analyzing by a SPD-10A detector."
3,Plant material,2.2 Plant material The investigated gum resin of B. carterii Birdw. in this study was the same as used in our previous reports [17–19].
4,Extraction and isolation,"2.3 Extraction and isolation The pretreatment of the gum resin of B. carterii (6 Kg) was the same as that described in our previous reports [17–19]. Briefly, the olibanum was extracted firstly by 95% EtOH to obtain the crude extracts, which were extracted subsequently with petroleum ether (PE), CH2Cl2, ethyl acetate (EtOAc), and n-BuOH to obtain parts of different polarities. The PE part (2000 g) was rapidly partitioned into four fractions by silica gel column chromatography (CC) eluting with solvents of PE, CH2Cl2 and EtOAc. The partitioned PE fraction (500 g) was subsequently applied to silica gel CC (PE-EtOAc, from 100:0 to 0:1) to obtain four fractions (PE-1 ~ PE-4). Fraction PE-2 [PE- EtOAc (25:1), 12.0 g] was repeatedly subjected to silica gel CC (PE-EtOAc, from 100:0 to 0:1) to yield 9 fractions (PE2–1 ~ PE2–9). PE2–4 [PE- EtOAc (5:1), 75 mg] was purified using preparative HPLC [mobile phase: CH3CN-H2O (65:35); flow rate: 5 mL min−1; UV detection at 205 nm] to afford compounds 3 (7 mg). PE2–8 [PE- EtOAc (3:1), 60 mg] was purified using preparative HPLC system [mobile phase: CH3CN-H2O (65:35); flow rate: 5 mL min−1; UV detection at 205 nm] to afford 5 (11 mg). Fraction PE-3 [PE- EtOAc (15:1), 24.0 g] was repeatedly subjected to silica gel CC (PE-EtOAc, from 100:0 to 0:1) to yield 10 fractions (PE3–1 ~ PE3–10). PE3–7 [PE- EtOAc (3:1), 50 mg] was purified using preparative HPLC system [mobile phase: CH3CN-H2O (55:45); flow rate: 5 mL min−1; UV detection at 230 nm] to afford 1 (14 mg). PE3–9 [PE- EtOAc (3:1), 25 mg] was purified using preparative HPLC system [mobile phase: CH3CN-H2O (50:50); flow rate: 5 mL min−1; UV detection at 210 nm] to afford 2 (8 mg) and 4 (9 mg). 2.3.1 Boscartinol A (1) Colorless oil (CH3OH-CHCl3); [α]D 25 = −6.25° (c 0.8, CH3OH); IR (KBr) νmax: 3440, 2968, 2877, 1614, 1455, 1381, 1246, 1064 cm−1; 1H NMR (DMSO‑d 6, 400 MHz) and 13C NMR (DMSO‑d 6, 100 MHz), see Table 1 ; HRESI-MS (positive mode) m/z: 345.2398 [M + Na]+ (calcd.

Briefly, as for the anti-inflammatory assay, LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cell model was treated with compounds 1–5 at five concentrations of 1.25, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0 μM, and then the cell supernatants was taken and reacted with Griess reagents I and II to measure the NO production, with dexamethasone served as the positive control.

Furthermore, cellular cytotoxicity of these compounds for HepG2 cell was measured by the MTT assay at the concentration of 10.0 μM."
6,Results and discussion,"Five new cembranoid alcohols (1–5) were obtained from the petroleum ether part of the gum resin of B. carterii by repeatedly column chromatography upon silica gel and preparative HPLC, which were elucidated as the isopropyl-type cembrane diterpenoids by the NMR analysis (Tables 1 and 2), revealing the characteristic signals of one 14-membered macrocyclic and one isopropyl. Compound 1 was obtained as colorless oil. The molecular formula of C20H34O3 was determined according to the positive HRESIMS analysis exhibiting ion peak at m/z 345.2398 [M + Na]+ (calcd. For C20H34O3Na, 345.2400), consistent with 4 indices of hydrogen deficiency. Its IR spectrum indicated absorption bands for hydroxyl (3440 cm−1) and olefinic (1614 cm−1) groups. Combined analysis of the 13C NMR and HSQC spectra of 1 revealed 20 carbon signals, associated with five methyls, six methylenes, five methines including two oxygenated carbons at δ C 66.9 (C-7), 78.4 (C-11), two sp2 olefinic methines at δ C 121.2 (C-3), 125.6 (C-9), and four nonprotonated carbons including two oxygenated carbon at δ C 88.2 (C-1), 84.4 (C-12), and two sp2 olefinic carbons at δ C134.2 (C-4) and 138.1 (C-8). Additionally, signals of one isopropyl at δ H 0.88 (3H, d, J = 7.2 Hz, Me-16), 0.96 (3H, d, J = 7.2 Hz, Me-17), 1.82 (1H, m, H-15), three methyls at δ H 1.16 (3H, s, Me-20), 1.73 (3H, s, Me-19) and 1.62 (3H, s, Me-18), two oxygenated methines at δ H 4.71 (1H, t, J = 6.8 Hz, H-7), 3.20 (1H, dd, J = 2.4,13.2 Hz, H-11), two olefinic protons at δ H 5.11 (1H, t, J = 6.4 Hz, H-3), 5.57 (1H, dd, J = 3.6, 12.4 Hz, H-9) were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1. The above presented NMR features of 1 matched with a C1-isopropyl typed cembranoid additionally possessed three tertiary methyls of Me-18, Me-19 and Me-20 located at C-4, C-8 and C-12, respectively, which were further confirmed by the five fragments of (a) CH2–2-CH-3, (b) CH2–5-CH2–6-CH(OH)-7, (c) = CH-9-CH2–10-CH(OH)-11, (d) CH2–13-CH2–14, (e) CH-15-CH3–16/CH3–17 assigned by the 1H 1H COSY correlations and the HMBC correlations of the five joints between H2–2/H-3/H-15/Me-16/Me-17 and C-1; between H2–2/H-3/H2–5/H2–6/Me-18 and C-4; between H2–6/H-7/H-9/H2–10/Me-19 and C-8; between H2–10/H-11/H2–14/Me-20 and C-12; between H-15 and C-1/C-2/C-14. Furthermore, two endocyclic double bonds at C3 C4 and C8 C9 were supported by the HMBC correlations of H-3 to C-1/C-5/Me-18, H-9 to C-7/C-8/C-10/C-11/Me-19, Me-18 to C-3/C-4/C-5, Me-19 to C-7/C-8/C-9 (Fig. 2 ). Apart from three degrees of unsaturation for two double bonds and a 14-membered carbocycle, the presence of one additional epoxy ring for a typical 1:12-epoxy in compound 1, was supported by the chemical shifts of two oxygenated tertiary carbons of C-1 and C-12 in combination of the molecular formula. Additionally, two hydroxy groups were linked at C-7 and C-11 according to the HMBC correlations of H-7 to C-5/C-6/C-8/C-9/Me-19, and H-11 to C-9/C-12/C-13/Me-20 (Fig. 2). Hence, compound 1 possessed a planar structure of 1:12-epoxy-3,8-cembrandine-7,11-diol. Analysis of the NOESY spectrum and coupling constants established the relative structure for 1. Two Z-geometry double bonds at C3 C4 and C8 C9 were deduced by the NOESY correlations of H-3 with H-7, H-11, Me-18, H-9 with H-10a, H-11, Me-19. Correlations of H-7 with H-3, H-10a, H-11; H-11 with H-3, H-7, H-9, H-10a, H-13a, Me-20; Me-20 with H-10a, H-11, Me-16, Me-17, indicated that signals of H-7, H-10a, H-11, H-13a, Me-20 were β-oriented, accordingly assigning the hydroxyl functionalities at C-7 and C-11 both as α-orientations (Fig. 3 ). Furtherly, the large coupling of H-9/H-10a, H-10a/H-10b and H-10b/H-11 indicated by the constants of J H-9,H-10a = 12.4 Hz, J H-10a,H-10b = 13.2 Hz, and J H-10b,H-11 = 13.2 Hz, and the small coupling of H-9/H-10b and H-10a/H-11 indicated by the constants of J H-9,H-10a = 3.6 Hz and J H-10a,H-11 = 2.4 Hz, established a torsional angle about 180° between the intersected flats of H(9)C(9)C(10) and H(10a)C(10)C(9), and the intersected flats of H(10b)C(10)C(11) and H(11)C(11)C(10) (Fig. 3), revealed an α-oriented hydroxy group at C-11, as well as the NOESY confirmed α-oriented hydroxy group at C-7. Finally, the relative configuration of 1 was elucidated as 1S,7R,11R,12R,3Z,8Z and structure was established as rel-(1S,7R,11R,12R,3Z,8Z)-1:12-epoxy-3,8-cembrandine-7,11-diol with additional aid of the 3D model structure (Fig. 3) by Chem 3D 17.1 program adopted energy minimized MM2 force field calculations, named as boscartinol A. Compound 2 was obtained as colorless oil. The molecular formula of C20H34O3 was determined according to the positive HRESIMS analysis exhibiting ion peak at m/z 323.2575 [M + H]+ (calcd. For C20H35O3, 323.2581), consistent with 4 indices of hydrogen deficiency. Its IR spectrum indicated absorption bands for hydroxyl (3440 cm−1) and olefinic (1644 cm−1). Combined analysis of the NMR data of compound 2 revealed an isopropyl-type cembrane diterpenoids showing the exact planar structure in agreement with that of boscartin K, i.e. (1S,3E,7S,11R)-1:12-epoxycembr-3,8(19)-diene-7,11-diol, previously separated from the title plant by our group [18], with the differences fixed at the configurations of 2, which were further determined by the NOESY spectrum and coupling constants. As for the configuration of double bond at C3 C4, NOESY correlations of H-3 with H-11, H-15, and Me-18 with H-2a, H-7, as well as the absent correlations between H-3 and Me-18, deduced an E-geometry. Correlations of H-7 with H-2a, H-9a, H-10a, H-11, Me-18; H-11 with H-9a, H2–19, Me-20; H-10a with H-7, H-11, Me-16, Me-17, Me-20 indicated that signals of H-2a, H-7, H-9a, H-10a, H-11, Me-20 were β-oriented, accordingly assigning the hydroxyl functionalities at C-7 and C-11 as α-orientations (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the large coupling of H-9a/H-9b, H-9b/H-10a, H-10a/H-10b and H-10b/H-11 indicated by the constants of J H-9a,H-9b = 14.0 Hz, J H-9b,H-10a = 14.0 Hz, J H-10a,H-10b = 14.0 Hz, and J H-10b,H-11 = 14.0 Hz, and the small coupling of H-9a/H-10a, H-9a/H-10b, H-9b/H-10b indicated by the constants of J H-9a,H-10a = 4.8 Hz, J H-9a,H-10b = 4.8 Hz, J H-9b,H-10b = 4.0 Hz, and no peak splitting between H-10a/H-11, established a torsional angle about 180° between the intersected flats of H(9b)C(9)C(10) and H(10a)C(10)C(9), and the intersected flats of H(10b)C(10)C(11) and H(11)C(11)C(10) (Fig. 3), revealed an α-oriented hydroxy group at C-11, as well as the NOESY confirmed α-oriented hydroxy group at C-7. Finally, the relative configuration of 2 was elucidated as 1S,7R,11R,12R,3E and structure was established as rel-(1S,7R,11R,12R,3E)-1:12-epoxy-3,8(19)-cembrdiene-7,11-diol with additional aid of the 3D model structure (Fig. 3) by Chem 3D 17.1 program adopted energy minimized MM2 force field calculations, named as boscartinol B. Compound 3 was obtained as colorless oil. The molecular formula of C20H34O3 was determined according to the positive HRESIMS analysis exhibiting ion peak at m/z 323.2585 [M + H]+ (calcd. For C20H35O3, 323.2581), consistent with 4 indices of hydrogen deficiency. Its IR spectrum indicated absorption bands for hydroxyl (3443 cm−1) and olefinic (1646 cm−1). Further analysis of the NMR data tested for compound 3 inferred an isopropyl-type cembrane diterpenoid structure greatly resembled to that of compound 2. And the main differences were defined as the migration of the two double bonds from C3 C4 and C8 C19 to C4 C5 and C7 C8, and the hydroxy group from C-7 to C-3, which were further confirmed by the HMBC spectrum with correlations of H-3 (δ H 4.86) to C-1 (δ C 89.3), C-2 (δ C 43.0), C-4 (δ C 140.5), C-5 (δ C 123.6), Me-18 (δ C 17.3), H-5 (δ H 5.40) to C-3 (δ C 65.7), C-6 (δ C 25.7), C-7 (δ C 123.0), Me-18, H-7 (δ H 5.45) to C-5, C-6, C-9 (δ C 33.5), Me-19 (δ C 17.0), Me-18 (δ H 1.67) to C-3, C-4 (δ C 140.5), C-5 (δ C 123.6), Me-19 (δ H 1.65) to C-7, C-8 (δ C 132.2), C-9 (Fig. 2). Thus, a planar structure for 3 was in agreement with that of 1:12-epoxy-4,7-cembrdiene-3,11-diol. Analysis of the NOESY spectrum and coupling constants established the relative structure for 3. NOESY correlations of H-5/Me-18 and H-7/Me-19 indicated that the double bonds at C4 C5 and C7 C8 were both Z-geometry. Correlations of H-3 with H-2b, H-6a, H-7, H-11, H-15; H-11 with H-2b, H-3, H-7, Me-16, Me-17, Me-20; H-2b with H-3, H-11, Me-16, Me-17 indicated that signals of H-2b, H-3, H-6a, H-11 were β-oriented, accordingly assigning the 3- and 11-hydroxyl functionalities as α-orientations (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the large coupling between the large coupling of H-2a/H-2b and H-2a/H-3 indicated by the constants of J H-2a,H-2b = 15.2 Hz and J H-2a,H-3 = 8.8 Hz, and the small coupling of H-2b/H-3, established the above ascertained configuration for H-3, rendered an α-oriented hydroxy group at C-3, as well as the NOESY confirmed α-oriented hydroxy group at C-11. Finally, the relative configuration of 3 was elucidated as 1S,3R,11R,12R,4Z,7Z and structure was established as rel-(1S,3R,11R,12R,4Z,7Z)-1:12-epoxy-4,7-cembrdiene-3,11-diol with additional aid of the 3D model structure (Fig. 3) by Chem 3D 17.1 program adopted energy minimized MM2 force field calculations, named as boscartinol C. Compound 4 was obtained as colorless oil. The molecular formula of C20H32O3 was determined according to the positive HRESIMS analysis exhibiting ion peak at m/z 345.2400 [M + Na]+ (calcd. For C20H34O3Na, 345.2400), consistent with 4 indices of hydrogen deficiency. Its IR spectrum indicated absorption bands for hydroxyl (3410 cm−1) and olefinic (1615 cm−1). Further analysis of the NMR data tested for compound 4 inferred an isopropyl-type cembrane diterpenoid structure greatly resembled to that of compound 1. And the main differences were defined as the migration of the double bond from C8 C9 to C6 C7, and the hydroxy group from C-7 to C-8, which were further confirmed by the HMBC spectrum with correlations of H-6 (δ H 5.62) to C-4 (δ C 135.0)/C-5 (δ C 40.1)/C-7 (δ C 139.5)/C-8 (δ C 72.5), H-7 (δ H 5.29) to C-5/C-6 (δ C 124.0)/C-8/C-9 (δ C 37.7)/Me-19 (δ C 31.6), Me-19 (δ H 1.15) to C-7/C-8/C-9, OH-8 (δ H 4.32) to C-8/C-9/Me-19 (Fig. 2). Thus, a planar structure for 4 was in agreement with that of 1:12-epoxy-3,6-cembrdiene-8,11-diol. Analysis of the NOESY spectrum and coupling constants established the relative structure for 4. Two E-geometry double bonds at C3 C4 and C6 C7 were deduced by the NOESY correlations of H-3 with H2–2, H-9a, H-11, Me-19, Me-18 with H-7, OH-11, H-6 with H2–5, OH-8, H-7 with H2–5, H-11, Me-18, as well as the large coupling constant of J H-6,H-7 = 15.6 Hz between H-6 and H-7. Correlations of OH-8 with H-6, H-9b, H-10a; OH-11 with H-9a, H-10b; H-11 with H-3, H-9b, H-10a, H-13a, 14b; H-13a with H-11, 14b, Me-16, Me-17, Me-20, indicated that signals of H-11, H-9b, H-10a, H-13a were β-oriented, accordingly assigning the hydroxyl functionalities at C-8 and C-11 both as α-orientations (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the large coupling between H-11 and H-10b indicated by the constant of J H-11,H-10b = 11.6 Hz established the above ascertained configuration for H-11, rendered an α-oriented hydroxy group at C-11 [13]. Finally, the relative configuration of 4 was elucidated as 1S,8S,11R,12R,3E,6E and structure was established as rel-(1S,8S,11R,12R,3E,6E)-1:12-epoxy-3,6-cembrdiene-8,11-diol with additional aid of the 3D model structure (Fig. 3) by Chem 3D 17.1 program adopted energy minimized MM2 force field calculations, named as boscartinol D. Compound 5 was obtained as colorless oil. The molecular formula of C20H34O3 was determined according to the positive HRESIMS analysis exhibiting ion peak at m/z 323.2584 [M + H]+ (calcd. For C20H35O3, 323.2581), consistent with 4 indices of hydrogen deficiency. Its IR spectrum indicated absorption bands for hydroxyl (3427 cm−1) and olefinic (1613 cm−1). Combined analysis of the NMR data of compound 5 revealed an isopropyl-type cembrane diterpenoids showing the exact planar structure in agreement with that of compound 4, i.e. the structure isomer of 4, with the differences fixed at the relative configurations, which were further determined by the NOESY spectrum and coupling constants. As for the configurations of double bonds at C3 C4 and C6 C7, NOESY correlations of H-3 with H-2b, H-11, H-14b, and Me-18 with H-2a, H-5b, H-6 with H-5b, H-11, Me-19, H-7 with H-5a, H-9a, H-11, Me-19, as well as the large coupling constant of J H-6,H-7 = 15.6 Hz between H-6 and H-7, deduced E-geometry for these two double bonds. Correlations of OH-8 with H-6, H-7, H-13b, H-15, OH-11 with H-9a, H-10a, H-13a, Me-19, H-11 with H-3, H-6, H-10a, H-15, H-15 with Me-16, Me-17, indicated that signals of OH-8, H-10a, H-13b, H-11 were β-oriented, accordingly assigning the hydroxyl functionalities at C-8 and C-11 as β and α-orientations, respectively (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the large coupling between H-11 and H-10b indicated by the constant of J H-11,H-10b = 12.0 Hz established the above ascertained configuration for H-11, rendered an α-oriented hydroxy group at C-11 [13]. Finally, the relative configuration of 5 was elucidated as 1S,8R,11R,12R,3E,6E and structure was established as rel-(1S,8R,11R,12R,3E,6E)-1:12-epoxy-3,6-cembrdiene-8,11-diol with additional aid of the 3D model structure (Fig. 3) by Chem 3D 17.1 program adopted energy minimized MM2 force field calculations, named as boscartinol E. As results shown, these five cembranoid alcohols 1–5 preserved the same isopropyl-type cembrane backbone, and a proposed biogenetic pathway was given in Fig. 4 , with incensole being as the origin [12,19]. It is indicated that the precursor of incensole biosynthesized a series of target compounds through oxidation, hydroxylation, dehydration, which further verified the above determined structures for 1–5. As for the biological activities, hepatoprotective and anti-inflammatory activities for 1–5 were tested using two cell models of APAP-induced HepG2 and LPS-induced RAW 264.7, with bicyclol (inhibition rate of 27.8%) and dexamethasone (2.2 μM) served as the positive controls according to the traditional pharmacological activities of the gum resin of B. carterii. Towards hepatoprotective activity, compounds 1 and 5 showed remarkable hepatoprotective activity (inhibition rate of 51.6% and 39.8%, respectively) at 10 μM, with the other three compounds of 2–4 showing less potently hepatoprotective (inhibition rates of −2.8%, 5.1% and 13.4%, respectively) (Table 3 ). Towards anti-inflammatory activity, compounds 2–4 showed significant inhibitory effects on NO produced by LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cell (IC50 values of 13.40 μM, 7.08 μM and 14.26 μM), with the other two compounds of 1 and 5 showing less potently anti-inflammatory activities (IC50 > 100 μM). Additionally, the cellular cytotoxicity against HepG2 and RAW 264.7 cells was tested by the MTT assay, with results showing no cell toxicities. It is suggested that the locations and configurations of hydroxy groups and double bonds may act importantly for the two kinds of biological activity. For instance, compounds 4 and 5 were a pair of isomers differentiated by the configuration of hydroxy group at C-8, with 8S and 8R showing different activities of anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective, respectively."
7,Conclusions,"In this current study, five new cembrane type diterpenoid alcohols, boscartinols A-E (1–5) were discovered from the gum resin of B. carterii. Notably, all these five compounds 1–5 preserved an isopropyl type cembranoid skeleton, featured the same groups of one epoxy ring at C1-C12 and one hydroxy group at C-11, as well as two double bonds migrating from C3 to C9 and one hydroxy group from C3 to C8 within the cembranoid structure. These five cembranoid alcohols were subjected to hepatoprotective and anti-inflammatory evaluations using two cell models of APAP-induced HepG2 and LPS-induced RAW 264.7. For hepatoprotective activity, compounds 1 and 5 showed remarkable hepatoprotective activity (inhibition rate of 51.6% and 39.8%, respectively) at 10 μM, with the other three compounds of 2–4 showing less potently hepatoprotective (inhibition rates of −2.8%, 5.1% and 13.4%, respectively) (Table 3). For anti-inflammatory activity, compounds 2–4 showed significant inhibitory effects on NO produced by LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cell (IC50 values of 13.40 μM, 7.08 μM and 14.26 μM), with the other two compounds of 1 and 5 showing less potently anti-inflammatory activities (IC50 > 100 μM). It is suggested that the locations and configurations of hydroxy groups and double bonds may act importantly for these two kinds of biological activity, with functionalities of 7,11-diol and 3,6-cembrandine in 1 may acting importantly for hepatoprotective activity and 3,11-diol and 4,7-cembrandine in 3 for anti-inflammatory activity, which show significantly interest for further investigation to prove the active functionalities as well as possible hepatoprotective and anti-inflammatory mechanisms."
