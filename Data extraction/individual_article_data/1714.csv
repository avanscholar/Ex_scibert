0,Introduction,"As an eco-friendly energy carrier, oxidant and environmental remediation agent [1,2], hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has been extensively used in organic synthesis, disinfection, environmental restoration and sustainable energy conversion/storage [3]. Nevertheless, the disconnection between huge demand and low production efficiency based on the conventional anthraquinone-based industrialized production technique [4], is impelling numerous researches on exploiting green, energy-saving, high-efficiency and sustainable strategies for H2O2 production [5]. In recent years, photocatalytic H2O2 production with semiconductor materials has attracted particular attention as only H2O, O2, sunlight and photocatalyst are involved during the proton-coupled electron transfer process [6], generally either a direct two-electron O2 reduction or a sequential two-step single-electron O2 reduction [7]. Researchers are devoting themselves to design and construct various photocatalysts for the H2O2 production according to the rational match of conduction/valence band, such as TiO2-based [8], graphite carbon nitride based [9], inorganic [10], metal–organic materials [11], metal-free polymer [12] and hybrid photocatalyst [13] et.al. To improve their photocatalytic performances, the focal point is tuning morphology, anchoring precious metal nano-particles and constructing heterojunction to increase active surface area, boost visible light utilization and promote separation/transportation of photogenerated carriers [6]. CuBi2O4, as a narrow band-gap semiconductor, has aroused great research enthusiasm due to its favorable photocatalytic activity with a strong visible light response [14]. However, its narrow band-gap and high photogenic electro (e- ) – hole (h+ ) pair recombination immensely limited the further application of pure CuBi2O4 [15], especially in photocatalytic production. Many kinds of research on CuBi2O4-based catalysts [16–18] have been carried out through constructing heterojunction with suitable semiconductors to possess substantially staggered band alignment for improving photocatalytic activity. Recently, constructing heterojunctions via introducing heteroatoms is an effective strategy for creating a new doping energy level [19], in which the crystal structure of the host cannot be changed and the band-gap position of semiconductors can be effectively modulated [20]. For example, a substitution of N or C for O in metal oxides partially will increase valence band position, narrow band-gap and boost its catalytic properties [21]. Furthermore, the formed nanointerfaces during constructing heterojunctions can synergistically promote the charge transfer on account of the mutual interaction at the interface [22], and the exposed defects can provide more active sites to improve the catalytic performance. Nevertheless, it is still a great challenge to synthesize defective CuBi2O4-based nanointerfacial photocatalysts with excellent performance for H2O2 production. Generally, tuning the interfacial charge transfer and band bending towards a direct Z-scheme photocatalytic system can retain photogenerated charges with more robust redox capability [23–27]. Hence, we synthesized a direct Z-scheme one-dimensional (1 D) CuBiOS@CuBi2O4 nanorod heterojunctions with tunable OS nanointerface via in-situ anion exchange. The synthesis process in detail was shown in Scheme1 . The constructed core (oxide)-shell (sulfide) nanostructure and OS interpenetrated nanointerface with surface oxygen vacancies could effectively reduce interface contact resistance, facilitate band bending, improve charge transfer, facilitate separation and migration of photo-excited carriers, and thus significantly boost photocatalytic activities. The as-prepared CuBiOS@CuBi2O4 with tunable compositions exhibited a greatly improved photocatalytic performance in the production of H2O2 with a yield of 201.9 μmol·L-1 and the in-situ generated H2O2 effectively accelerated the reduction of chromium(VI) (Cr(VI), 95.4% within 15 min). This work may advance the utilization of practical photocatalysts for H2O2 production and environmental remediation, and inspire further development of catalytic materials with well-defined nanointerface for various applications."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, 99%), copper nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, 99 ∼ 102%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 96%), sodium sulfide (Na2S, 98%), potassium iodide (KI, 99%) and ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 99%) were bought from Sinopharm chemical reagent Co. Ltd (Shenyang)."
3,Synthesis of rod-like CuBi2O4 and CuBiOS@CuBi2O4 composites,"2.2 Synthesis of rod-like CuBi2O4 and CuBiOS@CuBi2O4 composites Typically, 2.42 g Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, 0.60 g Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and 0.87 g NaOH were dissolved in 80 mL of deionized water via stirring for 3 h, then the solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 180 °C for 24 h. Then the final rod-like CuBi2O4 was washed with deionized water and dried in an oven at 70 °C for 8 h. The rod-like CuBiOS@CuBi2O4 composites were obtained via surface anion exchange. Specifically, 0.25 g of the as-prepared CuBi2O4 powder was added into 35 mL solution containing different amounts (10 mg, 30 mg, 50 mg and 300 mg (excess)) of Na2S. After stirring for 30 min, the above solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 120 °C for 4 h. Finally, the product was washed with deionized water, and dried in an oven at 70 °C for 8 h. Finally, the obtained CuBiOS@CuBi2O4 composites with different vulcanization degrees were named as CuBiOS@CuBi2O4-1, CuBiOS@CuBi2O4-2, CuBiOS@CuBi2O4-3, CuBiOS, respectively."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations The as-synthesized photocatalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) with X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS, SU8010, Hitachi Co., Japan), transmission electron microscope (TEM, 2100F, JEOL Co., Japan), X-Ray powder diffraction (XRD, D8 advanced diffractometer, Bruker Co., Germany), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy(FTIR, PerkinElmer Co., America), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250 Xi, Thermo Electron Co., America), electron spin resonance (ESR, ER200-SRC, Bruker Co., Germany), UV–visible spectrophotometer (UV–vis, UV-2600, Shimadzu, Japan). Mott-Schottky plot, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and time-resolved photocurrent were carried out on a computer-controlled electrochemical workstation (CHI 660D, Shanghai ChenHua Instruments Co., China) in a three-electrode configuration with the as-prepared materials (5 mg) on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, 2 × 2 cm2) as the working electrode, the Pt wire as the counter electrode, the Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and 0.10 mol·L-1 (M) Na2SO4 as electrolyte. Quantitative analysis was obtained by UV–vis absorption spectrometer (TU-1900, Beijing Puxi General Co., China)."
5,Photocatalytic H2O2 generation,"2.4 Photocatalytic H2O2 generation The photocatalytic H2O2 generation was evaluated by the molecular oxygen activation under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm) with a 300 W Xenon lamp. Typically, 50 mg catalyst was dispersed into 50 mL ethanol/H2O (1/20, v/v) mixed solution in a reaction vessel and ultrasonic dispersed evenly. After that, the suspension (pH = 3, adjusting with 1 mol·L-1 HClO4) was stirred in dark for 60 min to achieve adsorption–desorption equilibrium among catalyst, oxygen and solution before irradiation. During the process of photocatalysis, 1 mL suspension was taken at an interval of 30 min, then 2 mL 0.1 mol·L-1 KI and 0.05 mL 0.01 mol·L-1 (NH4)6Mo7O24 were added in the above solution after centrifugation, and the absorbance was determined by UV–Vis spectrometry. The linear equation of H2O2 production was shown in Fig S1 . The decomposition behavior of H2O2 over catalysts was also investigated by dispersing 50 mg catalyst in 50 mL 5 mmol·L-1 H2O2 solution (pH = 3) and irradiated for 60 min under continuous stirring."
6,In-situ H2O2-assisted Cr(VI) reduction by photocatalysis,"2.5 In-situ H2O2-assisted Cr(VI) reduction by photocatalysis Typically, 20 mg photocatalyst was put into 50 mL 10 mg·L−1 Cr(VI) solution (pH = 3, ethanol / H2O = 1/20, v/v), and magnetically stirred 30 min in dark to achieve adsorption–desorption equilibrium with continuous purging O2, then the degradation of Cr(VI) was evaluated under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm) with a 300 W Xenon lamp. During the photocatalytic reduction, 4 mL suspension was taken at an interval of 30 min and the residual Cr(VI) was quantified with a UV–vis spectrophotometer after centrifugation. After the determination, the solution was poured back to keep the solution volume constant. Photocatalytic reduction (PCR) of Cr(VI) was also carried out in a similar process without ethanol and O2 at pH = 2."
7,Results and discussion,"The morphologies of catalysts were characterized by SEM. As shown in Fig. 1 a–c, the obtained CuBi2O4 exhibited a nanorod structure with a smooth surface. The average diameter of CuBi2O4 was about 130 nm and the length was about 1 μm. After surface vulcanization (Fig. 1d), the outer surface became very rough without changing the rod structure (Fig. 1e, f), indicating that the outer CuBi2O4 might in-situ transform to CuBiOS. When it was vulcanized entirely, most of the rod-like structure was destroyed (Fig. 1g) and the surface of the remaining nanorods became much rougher (Fig. 1h–i). EDS analysis confirmed the presence of Cu, Bi, O of CuBi2O4 nanorods ( Fig. S2 a) and the introduction of S with different vulcanization ( Fig. S2 b, c). The microstructure of CuBiOS@CuBi2O4-2 was further observed to prove the formation of heterojunction by TEM and HRTEM. A large number of rough nanorods with an average diameter below 200 nm were appeared in Fig. 2 a–b. In the HRTEM image, the clear lattice spacing of 0.32 and 0.29 nm (Fig. 2c) were in accordance with the (211) crystal plane of CuBi2O4 [16] and (102) of CuBiOS. The surface lattice disordered area (in the blue dotted box) might be induced by the replacement of O with S, which would generate surface oxygen vacancy defects and offer extra active sites for catalysis [28]. Moreover, the TEM element mapping images (Fig. 2d) of Cu, Bi, O, S and all mixed elements mapping confirmed the homogenous distribution and intimate contact of CuBi2O4 and CuBiOS in the as-constructed heterojunction, which was beneficial for reducing the interface contact resistance and consequently promoting the charge transfer. The crystal structures of photocatalysts were characterized by XRD and the corresponding patterns were displayed in Fig. 3 a. The diffraction peak of the as-obtained CuBi2O4 was consistent with the diffraction peak of the orthorhombic CuBi2O4 (JCPDS No.42–0334) [18,29]. Additionally, the relative intensity of (211) peak gradually decreased and the intensity of (220) peak gradually increased without changing the crystal structure. In other words, the peak intensity ratio of (211) / (220) was decreased gradually ( Fig. S3 ), indicating that the crystal plane of (220) was more easily damaged and oxygen vacancy was more liable to generate at this crystal plane [30]. After complete vulcanization, CuBi2O4 was completely transformed into CuBiOS (JCPDS No.46–0436). The FTIR spectra displayed a series of coexisting peaks as shown in Fig. 3b: a broad peak centered at 3400 cm−1 and the peak of 1640 cm−1 were related to the OH stretching and bending vibration; the peak located at 1386 cm−1 was assigned to Bi-O stretching vibration and the broad peak at 542 cm−1 was attributed to Cu-O/Bi-O stretching vibration [31]. After vulcanization, new peaks at ∼ 618 and ∼ 1109 cm−1 assigning to Cu-S/Bi-S and SO bond enhanced progressively with the increasing vulcanization, respectively [32,33], further confirmed S element was successfully introduced into CuBi2O4 with different degrees. Further evidence was also acquired from the Raman spectra in Fig. 3c, and there were five peaks centered at 124, 187, 259, 404 and 583 cm−1 assigned to the typical Raman signals of CuBi2O4 [34]. Notably, the intensities of peaks at 259, 404 and 583 cm−1 became weaker and broader gradually with a bit of positive shift ( Fig. S4 ) as the vulcanization degree increased, which indicated the content of oxygen vacancies were also increased [30]. And the peaks at 107 and 150 ∼ 170 cm−1 for Bi-S [32] and 472 cm−1 for Cu-S [35] were gradually enhanced with the vulcanization degree increased. XPS spectra were performed to elucidate the compositional information and valence states of CuBi2O4 and CuBiOS@CuBi2O4-2. The full spectra ( Fig. S5 ) revealed the expected elements of Cu, Bi and O for CuBi2O4 and the late introduction of S for CuBiOS@CuBi2O4-2, respectively. In the Cu 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 3d) of CuBiOS@CuBi2O4-2, the representative Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2 peaks were divided into two peaks, respectively, in which the binding energy at 932.1 eV / 951.9 eV could be assigned to Cu+ species [36], and the peaks at 934.3 eV / 954.1 eV could be Cu2+ species [37]. The presence of low valance Cu+ generally indicated the existence of oxygen vacancy, ultimately leading to an increased acceptor density and photocurrent density [38]. From Fig. 3e, the peaks of Bi 4f centered at 159.1 eV and 164.6 eV were assigned to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2, respectively, confirming the existence of Bi3+ [39,40]. Apart from this, there were two peaks of S 2p at 163.4 eV and 164.2 eV corresponding to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, while the peak at 168.8 eV was assigned to SO4 2- [41,42]. In Fig. 3f, the O 1 s spectrum for CuBi2O4 was deconvoluted into three peaks located at 529.8 eV (lattice oxygen, OL), 531.0 eV (vacancy oxygen, OV) and 531.6 eV (chemical oxygen, OC) [43,44], in which the vacancy oxygen was dominant. The generated oxygen vacancies on the nanointerfaces could effectively facilitate band bending, promote the oxygen molecule activation process and thus enhance the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons-holes [45]. Based on the above results, the surface partially vulcanized CuBiOS@CuBi2O4 nanorods were successfully synthesized. UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectrum was implemented to investigate the optical absorption characteristics of photocatalysts and shown in Fig. 4 a. The light absorption abilities of the as-prepared heterojunctions with different vulcanization degrees in the full spectrum were enhanced compared with CuBiOS. As shown in Fig. 4a, CuBiOS@CuBi2O4-2 exhibited the highest light absorption mainly owing to the formation of the surface state energy between CuBi2O4 and CuBiOS [46,47], thereby generating more photo-induced carriers benefiting for improving photocatalytic activities. According to Kubelka-Munk theory, the band gaps of CuBi2O4 and CuBiOS were 1.8 eV and 1.3 eV (inset in Fig. 4a), respectively. It is reported that the approximate Fermi level could obtain from the flat band potential of semiconductor materials in equilibrium [27]. Therefore, Mott-Schottky analysis was carried out to explicit the semiconductor type and flat band potential. As illustrated in Fig. 4b, the positive linearity implied that both CuBi2O4 and CuBiOS were n-type semiconductors [48]. As the conduction band (ECB ) of n-type semiconductor was 0.1 – 0.3 eV lower than the potential of flat band potential [32], the corresponding ECB of CuBi2O4 and CuBiOS were −0.64 eV and −0.69 eV vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively. According to ECB = EVB − Eg [49], the valence band potentials (EVB ) of CuBi2O4 and CuBiOS were 1.16 eV and 0.61 eV vs. NHE, respectively. Transient photocurrent response was carried out to further survey the separation of photo-induced electrons-holes. As shown in Fig. 4c, CuBiOS@CuBi2O4-2 heterojunction exhibited the highest photocurrent compared with other catalysts, indicating more efficient charge separation efficiency on the heterogeneous element heterojunction without any interface between CuBi2O4 and CuBiOS. From the EIS Nyquist plots in Fig. 4d, the circular radius of CuBiOS@CuBi2O4-2 was smaller than that of CuBi2O4 and CuBiOS, indicating a lower charge transfer resistance [50]. The enhanced transient photocurrent and the decreased circular radius revealed a faster population of charge carrier driven by the built-in electric field at the OS interpenetration nanointerface [51,52]. The formed OS interpenetration as an integrated and barrier-free of electron transfer layer between CuBi2O4 and CuBiOS would provide more active sites and effective charge transfer channels, effectively inhibite the photo-generated charge carrier recombination and thus enhance the photocatalytic performance. The performance of photocatalyst for H2O2 production was evaluated in oxygen saturated acid solution (pH = 3) under visible light irradiation. It was found in Fig. 5 a that the H2O2 production was gradually climbed up and then declined with the increase of the vulcanization degree, and the optimum photocatalytic performance was achieved by CuBiOS@CuBi2O4-2 with a largest photocatalytic H2O2 production of 102.3 μmol·L-1 at 30 min. The photocatalytic reaction time was extended to 180 min to further investigate the stability of photocatalytic H2O2 production, the H2O2 yield tended to be stable and ultimately achieved 201.9 μmol·L-1, which was 1.7 times of that with CuBi2O4 alone. The amount of H2O2 was measured with a colorimetric method by UV–vis spectroscopy and it could be clearly observed ( Fig. S6 ) that the absorbance at 350 nm increased gradually with time increased. In addition, there was no H2O2 generation without visible light or photocatalyst, demonstrating photocatalyst and visible light were essential for H2O2 generation. The excellent photocatalytic performance might be due to the formation of OS interpenetration in CuBiOS@CuBi2O4 with the unique shell-core structure and the intimate contact due to inter-doping nanointerface, which would promote electron transfer, improve the separation efficiency of photogenic carriers, and thus enhance photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, gas environments and pH of the initial solution have a great influence on H2O2 production. In Fig. 5b, it clearly showed that the oxygen atmosphere was one of the prerequisites for the photocatalytic H2O2 production. The H2O2 yield was reduced with air and completely inhibited with N2, indicating that the production of H2O2 with CuBiOS@CuBi2O4-2 might be achieved through the photoelectron reduction of O2. The solution pH played a vital role in photocatalytic H2O2 production, because the process of H2O2 generation was a proton-coupled electron transfer process [53]. As shown in Fig. 5c, only 121.5 μmol·L-1 H2O2 was generated within 120 min as pH = 1, which might be due to the gradual oxidation of H2O2 to H2O by excessive protons (H2O2 + 2H+ + 2e- = 2H2O). As pH increased to 3, the production of H2O2 reached the maximum (164.3 μmol·L-1), while pH further increased to 5, the H2O2 production decreased instead (91.1 μmol·L-1). In conclusion, photocatalyst, visible light, O2 and moderate protons were critical factors for H2O2 production. The cycle experiment of H2O2 production with CuBiOS@CuBi2O4-2 was also investigated for four runs. As presented in Fig. 5d, nearly no decline in the H2O2 yield was observed. Moreover, XRD pattern (Fig. 5e) and SEM image (Fig. 5f) of CuBiOS@CuBi2O4-2 after cycle experiment showed no obvious difference compared to the fresh CuBiOS@CuBi2O4-2, confirming the excellent recyclability of the as-prepared photocatalyst. It should be noted that H2O2 was instability at room temperature in terms of thermodynamic perspective. As shown in Fig. 5a, the H2O2 yield was gradually invariable as the existence of two competing paths (the production and decomposition of H2O2) during the photocatalytic reaction [54]. Especially under high concentration of H2O2, the generated H2O2 was easily decomposed via reacting with photogenerated electrons in the conduction band and holes in the valence band [55] (H2O2 + 2H+ + 2e- = 2 H2O, H2O2 + 2H+ = O2 + 2H+), which would greatly hinder the production of H2O2. Therefore, to get a better insight into the photocatalytic production of H2O2, the decomposition behaviors of H2O2 (5 mmol·L-1) with the as-prepared photocatalysts under the same conditions were also investigated. It was clearly shown in Fig. 6 a that H2O2 was decomposed in different degrees with different photocatalysts, and there was less than 2% of H2O2 decomposed without photocatalyst. Moreover, the kinetic rate constants of H2O2 production (Kp ) and decomposition (K d) were obtained by fitting Fig. 5a and Fig. 6a with zero-order kinetics (Fig. 6b) and first-order kinetics (Fig. 6c), respectively. As shown in Fig. 6d, the Kp value of the as-prepared catalysts with different sulfurization ratios showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing, while the K d value increased slowly. Notably, CuBiOS@CuBi2O4-2 exhibited the largest Kp/K d ratio, which indicated that CuBiOS@CuBi2O4-2 was more favorable for the photocatalytic generation of H2O2 with the highest yield. Furthermore, the PCR of Cr(VI) (10 mg·L-1, pH = 2) over various catalysts were also carried out under visible light. As shown in Fig. 7 a, CuBiOS@CuBi2O4-2 exhibited the highest degradation efficiency (96.0% within 30 min) toward Cr(VI) compared with other catalysts. It was obvious that the degradation efficiency was enhanced by adjusting the content of S. Moreover, the experimental results were conformed to the pseudo-first-order kinetic model ( Fig. S7 a) based on the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model, and the apparent rate constants (k) of CuBiOS@CuBi2O4-2 was the highest (62.7 × 10−3 min−1), which was about 16 times of CuBi2O4 (3.90 × 10−3 min−1). Additionally, the photocatalytic activity of CuBiOS@CuBi2O4-2 had barely declined after four cycling runs ( Fig. S7 b), confirming the excellent stability and reusability. Furthermore, the in-situ generated H2O2 played a critical role in accelerating the pollutant degradation for water treatment and environmental remediation [56]. As shown in Fig. 7b, the content of Cr(VI) was photocatalytic reduced to Cr(III) with the solution color faded rapidly from brilliant yellow to pale green (photographs inset in Fig. 7b), further confirmed CuBiOS@CuBi2O4-2 was a very promising photocatalyst for H2O2 production and expediting water treatment applications. Actually, the actual reduction of Cr(VI) was achieved by two different pathways: direct photochemical reduction by e- and indirect chemical reduction through the in-situ generated H2O2 as shown below: (1) Photochemical reaction: Cr(VI) + 3e- → 2Cr(III) (2) Chemical reaction: HCrO4 - (pH less than 6) + 3H2O2 + 8H+ → 2Cr3+ +3O2 + 8H2O To explore the pathway of photocatalytic production of H2O2, a series of free radical trapping experiments were implemented. Citric acid (CA), isopropyl alcohol (IPA), silver nitrate (AgNO3) and p-benzoquinone (PBQ) were served as scavengers for h+, ·OH, e- and ·O2 –, respectively. There was almost no reduction in the H2O2 production after adding CA or IPA (Fig. 8 a), indicating h+ and ·OH were not active species during the catalytic reaction. However, the yield of H2O2 was decreased obviously with AgNO3, implying e- was an indispensable active species during photocatalysis. Moreover, the production of H2O2 was also significantly decreased (more than 80%) with the addition of PBQ, indicating that O2 – was mainly responsible for the H2O2 production and might undergo a single-electron reduction approach (O2 + e- → ·O2 – + e- + 2H+ → H2O2) through O2 reduction reaction. To probe this, ESR combined with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) was also used to measure the ·O2 – generation of CuBiOS@CuBi2O4-2. The characteristic peaks of DMPO-·O2 – could be obviously observed under light in Fig. 8b, further confirming that CuBiOS@CuBi2O4-2 could generate ·O2 – to be further reduced to H2O2 via a single-electron reduction approach. Furthermore, ·OH could not be generated as the EVB of CuBiOS@CuBi2O4-2 was lower than the standard potential of ·OH/H2O (2.4 eV vs. NHE) based on the analysis of band-gap, also confirming that the process of photocatalytic H2O2 production was undergoing a reduction pathway rather than an oxidation way. XPS spectra were used to probe the electron-migration pathway, in which the acceptance of electrons would lead to a negative shift in binding energy [57]. As shown in Fig. 8c, the binding energy of Cu2+ in CuBiOS@CuBi2O4-2 negatively shifted compared to CuBi2O4, suggesting the photogenerated electrons were moved from CuBi2O4 to CuBiOS in accordance with a direct Z-scheme mechanism. Moreover, the M−S plot of CuBiOS@CuBi2O4-2 (Fig. 8d) exhibited two linear sections and a stationary region in the midsection. The linear sections with positive slopes were consistent with the characteristic of n-type semiconductor, and the stationary region independent of potential was a feature of high-density monoenergetic nanointerface states at the CuBiOS@CuBi2O4 heterojunctions [58,59]. Due to the OS interpenetration, the interfacial charge transfer was modulated and thus formed a quasi-continuous high-density monoenergetic nanointerface with low electric resistance, which was beneficial for the photo-induced carriers transfer from CuBi2O4 to CuBiOS driven by the interface potential, ultimately prolong carriers’ lifetime, lower recombination efficiency and facilitate to form a solid-state Z-scheme photocatalytic system between CuBi2O4 and CuBiOS [58]. According to the above analysis, the charge-transfer mechanism of photocatalytic H2O2 generation over CuBiOS@CuBi2O4-2 heterojunction was proposed in Scheme 2 . In general, the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) potential of 0 V relative to the vacuum energy (EVAC) level is −4.5 eV. The Fermi level (EF) of CuBiOS was more negative than CuBi2O4 due to the introduction of S element, and thus the work function (WF) obtained from WF = EVAC − EF for CuBiOS was lower than that of CuBi2O4, suggesting that electrons generated from CuBiOS would more easily escape from the solid. After contact, the electrons tended to migrate from CuBiOS to CuBi2O4 to achieve Fermi level equilibrium. Then, the interface between CuBiOS and CuBi2O4 was charged, and thus formed an internal electric field pointing from CB of CuBi2O4 to VB of CuBiOS through a direct Z-scheme charge transfer pathway, which would induce the charge redistribution and bring the depletion or accumulation of free charge carrier on the OS nanointerface. Besides, the energy band edges in CuBiOS with high Fermi levels were bent upward continuously toward the interface, and those in CuBi2O4 with low Fermi levels were bent downward towards the interface [60]. Ultimately, the accumulated electron on the CB of CuBiOS would react with dissolved O2 to generate O2 – (−0.33 eV vs.NHE), and then together with e- and H+ to produce H2O2 or directly reduce O2 to H2O2, finally leading to a high yield of H2O2. Meanwhile, ethanol as an electron donor could not only provide enough electrons for photocatalytic reduction, but also consume excess holes and greatly restrain photogenerated carriers restructuring and thus improve the photocatalytic performance. Based on these analyses, the possible reaction equations were proposed as below: (3) CuBi2O4 + hv → h+ (VB) + e- (CB) (4) CuBiOS + hv → h+ (VB) + e- (CB) (5) O2 + e- → O2 – (6) ·O2 – + e- + 2H+ → H2O2"
8,Conclusion,"A direct Z-scheme CuBiOS@CuBi2O4 nanorods heterojunction with core (oxide)-shell (sulfide) nanostructure and OS interpenetrated nanointerface was controllably synthesized through an in-situ partial anion exchange. The CuBiOS@CuBi2O4 photocatalyst with tunable OS interpenetration and rich O vacancies exhibited greatly improved photocatalytic performances in the H2O2 production with a yield of 201.9 μmol·L−1 in 180 min with a good stability and reusability, which was 1.7 times of that with CuBi2O4 alone. Moreover, 96.0% of Cr(VI) was degraded within 30 min with a highest apparent rate constants compared with others controlled photocatalysts, and the Cr(VI) degradation was significantly accelerated with an efficiency of 95.4% within 15 min by the synergistic effect of photocatalytic reduction and chemical reduction by the in-situ generated H2O2. A series experiments revealed that the photocatalytic H2O2 production was undergoing a sequential two-step single-electron O2 reduction reaction via a Z-scheme transfer mechnism driven by internal-electric-field. This work provides a novel sight to develop high-efficiency photocatalyst via nanointerface engineering and effectively utilize the in-situ generated H2O2 for accelerating the pollutant elimination."
