0,Introduction,"Production of chemicals and fuels from abundant, renewable biomass and its derivatives provides a viable route to alleviating the strong dependence worldwide on the depleting fossil fuels [1–3].A wide range of chemicals such as furfural, 5-hydroxymethyl furfural, levulinic acid, xylitol and glucaric acid are obtained from agricultural waste [4]. Furfural has a large spectrum of industrial applications and it is a major platform chemical. Furfural is obtained from the dehydration of fivecarbon sugars, such as xylose and arabinose, commonly obtained by acidic hydrolysis of hemicellulose-rich agricultural wastes [5]. Furfuryl alcohol produced by the hydrogenation of furfural is widely used in fine chemical and polymer industries. The major applications of furfuryl alcohol are the production of acid proof bricks, thermostatic resins, corrosion resistant polymer concrete, corrosion resistant fiber glass and liquid resins for galvanic bath tub. Furfuryl alcohol is also an important intermediate chemical in the synthesis of vitamin C, lysine, lubricants, dispersing agents, plasticizer and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol [6,7]. The main method for preparation of furfuryl alcohol is vapor-phase catalytic hydrogenation of furfural [8,9]. This approach requires high reaction temperature and high pressure of hydrogen. That mean an external hydrogen generation station is required to supply the hydrogen. The hydrogenation at high pressure also creates safety problems such as leakage, pumping, storage and explosiveness. In addition, most catalysts and solvents used for furfural hydrogenation have high toxicity and thus cause severe environmental pollution [10].Therefore, there is an urgent need for a green chemical process with moderate operating conditions for controlling pollution and eliminating safety hazards. Electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) offers a mild alternative to traditional chemical catalytic methods. This approach is not only usually performed at atmospheric pressure and temperatures below 100°C, but also avoids the need for externally supplied, fossil-based hydrogen gas and associated handling equipment. Ideally, the needed electricity would come from carbon-free sources such as solar, wind, or even nuclear power [11]. In the ECH process, the chemisorbed hydrogen (Hads) generated in situ on the catalytic electrode surface by electroreduction of hydronium ion or water(Reaction 1) reacts with the adsorbed organic substrates (Y=Z) (reaction2-4)under normal pressure and low temperature. These mild conditions prevent side reactions usually encountered in chemical catalytic hydrogenation. (1) H 3 O + +(H 2 O)+ e − → H ads + H 2 O(OH −) (2) Y = Z → Y = Z ads (3) Y = Z ads +2H ads → YH − ZH ads (4) YH − ZH ads → YH − ZH (5) 2H ads → H 2 (Tafelstep) or (6) H ads +(H 3 O + )(H 2 O)+ e − → H 2 + H 2 O(Heyrovskystep) However the competition between the substrate hydrogenation and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)(Tafel 5 or Heyrovsky 6 reactions) can drastically lower the current efficiency or prevent the ECH of substrates. Previous research on ECH of furfural showed that it is hard to obtain high yield of furfuryl alcohol because of the low conversion of furfural or low selectivity to furfuryl alcohol [12–16]. Nevertheless, research on ECH of phenol [17–19], guaiacol [11] and lactic acid [20] have shown that large cathode surface area are usually necessary to achieve high reaction rates. The conventional metal electrode have been used in many reactions but they have poor surface area. Electrodes made with pressed metallic powder particles have big surface area, but their mechanical strength is weak [21]. In order to improve these disadvantages, a well-defined catalytic cathode need to be developed. The use of carbons as catalyst supports is well established and activated carbon is the essential support material used by the industry, supporting metal catalysts. Recently, new forms of activated carbon, activated carbon fibers(ACF) are being prepared and has been used as electrode in the treatment of wastewater [22,23].This new form of activated carbon materials present noticeable advantageous characteristics in relation to usual activated carbons:(a)The apparent surface area of this active carbon is usually high, normally in the range 600-3000m2g−1.The porous network of ACF is mainly formed by deep pores in a narrow range of sizes, especially micropores [24]; (b)ACF can be easily processed to all kinds of shapes and easily to bent and rolled. The ACF's three-dimensional network of large pores provides electrically conductive host sites to support the metal catalyst particles. To develop a high-efficiency catalytic cathode, we immobilized platinum onto ACF using incipient wetness impregnation and electrodeposition methods. Platinum supported on carbon has been shown to be an efficient catalyst for classical chemical hydrogenation of various organics such as nitrobenzene [24], phenols [25], olefin [26], o-chloronitrobenzene [27]. In this investigation, ECH of furfural was assessed in terms of reactivity, product yield and current efficiency as functions of catalyst parameters (e.g. electrode types, preparation methods, platinum contents) and reaction conditions (temperature and electrolyte).Effect of starting furfural concentration and potential were also investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Reagents and electrodes,"2.1 Reagents and electrodes Furfural, furfuryl alcohol, H2PtCl6·6H2O, H2SO4, HCl, HClO4, NaOH, which are commercial available, were used without further purification. Activated carbon fibers(ACF) was obtained from Nantong Senyou Carbon Fiber Company Limited. The cathode material, including copper rod(Cu), nickel rod(Ni),lead rod(Pb) and platinum sheet(Pt) were obtained from Tianjin Aida Technology Development Company."
3,Pt/ACF preparation,"2.2 Pt/ACF preparation ACF was chosen as the support for the platinum catalysts due to good conductivity and high surface area. For most of the experiments, ACF was first washed in deionized water, and then boiled in concentrated HCl solution for three days to remove impurity, at last the ACF was thoroughly rinsing with deionized water to remove residual HCl, and then drying in the oven at 100°C [11]. Two methods were used for the catalyst preparation: incipient wetness impregnation and electrodeposition. For conventional impregnation method, an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 was used as precursor and two platinum loadings (3 wt% and 5 wt%) were prepared. Typically, an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 (0.04g H2PtCl6·6H2O in 10mL water, Pt content 0.015g) was used as precursor for 3 wt% Pt loading. A piece of ACF (1cm×1.5cm, about 0.05g) was first soaked in 1ml platinum precursor solution to saturate the ACF pores(Pt metal loading 3 wt%). For 5 wt% Pt loading, an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 (0.066g H2PtCl6·6H2O in 10mL water, Pt content 0.025g) was used as precursor. The wet ACF was dried under room conditions, then vacuum dried at room temperature, and finally reduced in a fixed-bed flow reactor with H2 (30 mLmin−1) at 400°C for 2h to give Pt/ACF catalyst [25]. For electrodeposition method, 3 wt% platinum loadings were prepared(EDPt/ACF) .Typically, an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 (0.008g H2PtCl6·6H2O in 10mL water, Pt content 0.003g) was prepared as catholyte, a piece of ACF(0.1g) was fixed with electrode holder as cathode. Thoroughly galvanostatic deposition was run in an undivided cell(volume15ml) with a current of 1 A. A piece of Pt sheet was used as the counter electrode. Working electrode was placed in the middle of the cell and electrolyte was stirred with magnetic stirrer during electrodeposition [28]."
4,Apparatus and experimental procedures,"2.3 Apparatus and experimental procedures All measurements were carried out in a H-type cell(30ml per chamber) with cation exchange membrane(DuPont® Nafion-117).The cell was cleaned by employing a standard procedure [29] for removing traces of organic and inorganic contaminants. Oxygen was removed by bubbling argon through the solution prior to the voltammetric experiments. Pretreatment of the electrodes was carried out to remove the metal oxides, which can deactivate the reaction when existing on the electrode surface. After polishing with sand paper, Ni, Cu,Pb and Pt electrodes were acid washed with 1M HCl solution for 1h. After pretreatment, all electrodes were rinsed with deionized water [15].The surface area (cm2) of the electrodes, used to calculate the current density (mA cm2) was obtained based on geometric area, except for Pt/ACF. In all experiments, a large platinum sheet was used as a counter electrode while a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was employed as a reference electrode. Electrochemical cell potentials were controlled with a potentiostat (DJS-292A,Shanghai xinrui, China). Catholyte (20mL) consisted of different concentrations H2SO4,HCl,HClO4 and NaOH depending on the experiments. The whole cell was placed in a water bath for experiments at controlled temperatures.The distance between cathode and anode was 3cm."
5,Product analysis,"2.4 Product analysis The organic products were diluted ten-fold with acetonitrile, filtered through 0.22μm filters and analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC, Shimadzu GC-2014 Series GC System, flame ionization detector) with a Rtx-wax capillary column (30 m×250μm).A gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer combination (GC-MS, Thermo Scientific AS 3000 Series) was used to identify the organic compounds."
6,Calculations,"2.5 Calculations The conversion, selectivity and electrochemical efficiency were calculated according to the following equations: Conversion=(molesfurfuralconsumed/initialmolesfurfural)×100 Selectivity=(molesdesiredproduct/totalmolesproducts)×100 Currentefficiency=(electronsusedtogenerateproduct(furfurylalcohol)/totalelectronspassed)×100"
7,Results and discussion,
8,ECH of furfural using different cathode,"3.1 ECH of furfural using different cathode To determine suitable metal to load on the ACF as electrode, copper, lead, nickel and platinum were chosen as electrode materials in this study. Fig. 1 shows cyclic voltammograms of the electrochemical reduction of furfural. In the voltammograms the onset potentials are visible, at which the reduction currents increase and hence the reduction reactions commence. In electrochemical reactions the current flow is proportional to the amount of compound converted per time. For the reduction of furfural the onset potential is about -1.1V, -0.9V, -0.8V, -0.2V on Cu,Pb,Ni and Pt respectively. As shown in Table 1 , on copper electrode in 0.1M NaOH,the electrolysis was performed at -1.2V. 80% of the initial furfural was consumed only 15% was transformed into furfuryl alcohol. The analysis by GC-MS have shown that other products are 2-methylfuran, 1,5-pentanediol(coming from the opening of the furan ring) and hydroxyfuroin(coming from electrohydrodimerization)(Fig. 2 ). This result is consistent with the findings of Parpot [13]. On lead cathode, the applied potential was set at -1.1V. Though the conversion of furfural is high(90%),the yield of furfuryl alcohol remained low (40%). It was found that the main reaction products were also coming from electrodimerization processes(Fig. 2). On nickel cathode,only 25% of the initial furfural was consumed and 80% were transformed into furfuryl alcohol. With Pt cathode, though the conversion remained very low (8%), the selectivity to furfuryl alcohol was very high(99%). Indicate that there were no other side reactions occur. This result showed that platinum is a suitable cathode material. Because of lack of active surface area with smooth platinum electrode, the conversion of furfural was low. This result may improved by a large active surface area on platinum [30]. So we choose platinum as catalyst to load on the ACF as cathode."
9,Characterization of Pt/ACF catalysts,"3.2 Characterization of Pt/ACF catalysts The catalytic cathodes’ BET surface area, micropore area and micropore volume were analyzed (Table 2 ). In order to assess the underlying support properties of the catalyst supports, blank ACF was pretreated in the same manner as the catalyst, by washing with DI water and reducing with hydrogen.The freshly prepared blank ACF and Pt/ACF catalysts were characterised by SEM. The blank ACF has a BET surface area of 2398m2g−1, very similar to the value reported in the literature [24]. Compared with other supports used for cathodes [11], this kind of support has much larger surface area. The majority of the pores are micropores and the volume is 1.13 cm3g−1(Table 2). Upon loading with different content of platinum, the ACF's micropore volumes decreased, suggesting that some of the micropores were filled by platinum or platinum deposition may occured on the mouth of the pore and resulted in the pore blockage. Fig. 3 A gives the SEM image of the blank ACF. It was clearly displayed a network structure with its carbon fibers knitted together. So the conductivity of ACF is very high, making it a good electrocatalyst support [24]. As shown in Table 2, 3%EDPt/ACF prepared by electrodeposition method, has a very small surface area and micropore volume than the other catalysts.This is probably due to drastic electrolysis process and platinum layers covered only on the surface of ACF and the micropore was blocked(Fig. 3B). SEM images of the 3% and 5% Pt/ACF prepared by impregnation method are shown in Fig. 3C and D. As seen in Fig. 3C, most of the platinum was distributed into white spots of nanoscale in 3%Pt/ACF. But SEM images of 5%Pt/ACF indicate partial platinum were agglomerated to bulk (Fig. 3D). This is probably due to excessive platinum precursor(H2PtCl6). Dispersion of Pt detected by CO adsorption is summarized in Table 3 . It is clear that both dispersion and metal area per gram of catalyst (or Pt) decrease sharply with increase in Pt loading from 3% to 5%. However, the particle size shows the opposite trend and both in nanoscale(2.1nm and 6.5nm), this result is consistent with SEM images of the 3% and 5% Pt/ACF. In addition, there is a sharply decrease in CO uptake with an increase of Pt loading from 3% to 5%, implying that more active hydrogenation sites are present on 3%Pt/ACF. These results concluded that the dispersion of Pt depends strongly on Pt loading and the preparation method."
10,ECH of furfural using different Pt/ACF catalysts,"3.3 ECH of furfural using different Pt/ACF catalysts ECH of furfural was studied with several different catalysts prepared using two methods (incipient wetness impregnation and electrodeposition).Two platinum loadings (3%,5% for impregnation method and 3% for electrodeposition method) were employed. Fig. 4 shows cyclic voltammograms of the electrochemical reduction of furfural with three kinds of Pt/ACF electrodes. The onset potential of these Pt/ACF electrodes is -0.35,-0.35V and -0.32V on 3%Pt/ACF,5%Pt/ACF and 3%EDPt/ACF, respectively. The results of electrocatalytic reduction of furfural with these electrodes(with potential of -0.5V) were summarized in Table 4 . Pt/ACF catalysts prepared from different methods showed different activities toward ECH of furfural. 3%Pt/ACF exhibited the highest activity among the three catalysts, followed by 5%Pt/ACF and 3%EDPt/ACF. This result may be attributed to decrease of catalytic activity area caused by pore blockage in 5%Pt/ACF and 3%EDPt/ACF. But all three Pt/ACF electrodes exhibitted better catalytic activity than metallic Pt electrode. This may be attributed to high real surface area of Pt/ACF electrodes [31]. According to K.Amouzegar and O.Savadogo [32]. The higher activity of Pt/ACF might not be completely due to higher surface area. Another contributing factor may be the interactions between Pt and the carbon support. It has been proposed that when Pt(with an electron work function of 5.4eV) is deposited on supports with a lower electron work function such as carbon or gold(4.7 and 4.3eV, respectively), the Pt electron density increases. The increased negative charge on Pt would result in a weakening of Pt-H bond and consequently an activation of reactions on supported Pt."
11,Control experiments,"3.4 Control experiments A control experiment carried out at room temperature using the blank ACF with no catalyst in 0.1M H2SO4 showed no furfural conversion(Table 4). For this control experiment, there were no metal active sites for atomic hydrogen, and no catalyst for the reaction.Thus, the ACF alone is incapable of hydrogenation. Another control experiment with 3%Pt/ACF catalyst and gaseous hydrogen(H2 gas was supplied by bubbling through the solution) run at room temperature similarly showed no reaction, confirming that Pt needs to be in electrical contact for hydrogenation of furfural to occur at the mild conditions of this study."
12,Effect of temperature,"3.5 Effect of temperature The effect of temperature on furfural ECH was studied with 0.1M H2SO4 as catholyte under a potential of -0.5V. Four different temperatures, 30, 50,70and 90°C, were studied, all much lower than those used in classical catalytic hydrogenation of furfural [10,33]. The current efficiency is a function of the competition between electrocatalytic hydrogenation and hydrogen desorption. Relative rates of hydrogenation and hydrogen evolution are thought to depend on the intrinsic thermochemistry of the reduction,adsorption modes and energies of the reactants and products, and the activity of chemisorbed hydrogen [17].Raising the temperature from 30°C to 50°C increased current efficiency from 78% to 85% but further heating to 90°C dropped it back to 74% (Fig. 5 ). This indicates that electrocatalytic hydrogenation was favored from 30°C to 50°C, while hydrogen desorption rates accelerated as temperature increased from 50°C to 90°C. Similar increases in the conversion and current efficiency with increasing temperature have been previously noted in the ECH of (a) lactic acid to lactaldehyde and propylene glycol [20] over 5% Ru/C in an RVC electrode using 0.01M H2SO4 as the electrolyte. (b) bio-oil derived phenolic compounds using ruthenium supported on activated carbon cloth studied by Li.et al. [11] (c) phenol to cyclohexanol on dispersed Pt electrode in 0.05M H2SO4, studied by Amouzegar and Savadogo [31]. The effects of temperature on the product selectivities are also shown in Fig. 5.At 30°C, product was almost all furfuryl alcohol,while raising the temperature from 30°C to 90°C decreased selectivity of furfuryl alcohol from 99% to 85%. It was found that the other reaction products were coming from electrodimerization processes(like Cu electrode,see Fig. 2)."
13,Effect of potential,"3.6 Effect of potential Potential, directly related to the total reaction rate, may have an effect on the current efficiency and product yield. Several different potentials from -0.4 to -0.7V were studied. As shown in Fig. 6 , furfural conversion increase when potential is in the range of -0.4V to -0.6V and then decrease at -0.7V. Current efficiency are basically invariant when potential is in the range of -0.4V to -0.6V and decrease drastically at -0.7V.An optimum potential usually exists for ECH of organic compounds [34]. When potentials are smaller than this optimum value, the surface coverage of the Hads is smaller. The probability of the collision between Hads and (furfural)ads is lower. With more negative potentials, the availability of surface Hads atoms increases, the ECH of furfural accelerates. However, the more negative the applied potential is, the unwanted HER step is more competitive, proceeding through Tafel or Heyrovsky steps [Eqs. (5) and (6)]. Hydrogen gas bubbles generated on the Pt/ACF electrode surface as the applied potential became higher than -0.6V.Therefore,the measured current efficiency reaches a maximum at -0.5V (85%) and decreases to 72% at -0.7V. Additionally, product selectivities are only slightly affected by potentials."
14,Effect of electrolyte,"3.7 Effect of electrolyte ECH of furfural was carried out in various electrolytes at 50°C and potential of -0.5V. Previous studies have shown that this reaction was hard to happen in neutral and alkaline medium with Pt electrode [13], so the study was carried out in the acidic medium. Electrolytes studied were 0.1M H2SO4, HClO4, HCl, 0.05M HCl and 0.2M HCl.The final yields of the products and current efficiencies are listed in Fig. 7 . In the concentration of 0.1M electrolytes,the yield of furfuryl alcohol was found to decrease in the order HCl,H2SO4 and HClO4.The adsorption of anions on electrode surfaces and their effects on hydrogen adsorption on metal surfaces have been extensively studied. The relative strengths of adsorption of the anions were found by Horanyi to decrease in the order Cl−>HSO4 −> ClO4 − on Pt electrode [35]. This was consistent with the experimental results of this study. In the HCl electrolytes of different concentration, the yield of furfuryl alcohol and current efficiency decreased in the order 0.1M>0.05M>0.2M. Controlling the hydrion concentration during the hydrogenation process is important for obtaining a high yield of furfuryl alcohol. Strongly acidic conditions lead to increase of H2 and decline of current efficiency .In addition,furfural adsorption onto catalyst sites is a key step in the hydrogenation reaction. The ionization state of furfural varies with solution pH, potentially affecting its adsorption characteristics."
15,Influence of starting reactant concentration,"3.8 Influence of starting reactant concentration Different starting concentrations of furfural were chosen to study their effects on the furfuryl alcohol yield and current efficiency during ECH. As shown in Fig. 8 , the current efficiency was maximized when the starting concentration was 80mmol.L−1. As the concentration was reduced below 80mmol.L−1, the hydrogenation of furfural became slower so that hydrogen evolution became more competitive. This is because there were many empty catalyst sites when starting concentration of furfural is low, so the unwanted HER step is more competitive and lead to decline of current efficiency. When the concentration of furfural is large, hydrogenation should be favored relative to the hydrogen evolution reaction. However, when all catalyst sites were occupied by furfural, more reactant needs more reaction time and this lead to more furfuryl alcohol volatilize."
16,Catalyst stability,"3.9 Catalyst stability Catalyst deactivation is an important concern during hydrogenation process. To evaluate the stability of Pt/ACF during ECH of furfural, the catalysts were reused three times. After each reaction, it was washed thoroughly using deionized water, followed by drying in vacuum desiccator. At the beginning of the next experiment, pre-electrolysis was carried out at -0.8V for 10min. As shown in Fig. 9 , for the ECH of furfural to furfuryl alcohol, the Pt/ACF electrode had a nearly constant activity after being reused three times at 50°C. The furfuryl alcohol yield and current efficiency remained at 82% and 78%, respectively, in third reuse, indicating a good stability of the electrode."
17,Conclusions,"Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol was accomplished with Pt, Ni, Cu, and Pb as cathode materials. The cathode material had a large effect on the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of furfural, with Pt giving the best result of product selectivity among those studied.This work shows that Pt/ACF is an efficient catalyst for electrocatalytic hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol under mild conditions compared to other catalytic reductions, including other ECH schemes. Catalyst comparisons demonstrated that Pt/ACF catalysts prepared via the impregnation method show much better activity than that prepared by electrodeposition method. When using incipient wetness impregnation, 3%Pt/ACF showed the highest activity among the two Pt loading studied. With 3%Pt/ACF as catalyst, -0.5V was the best electrolytic potential.The kind of electrolytes also affected product selectivities and current efficiency. Furfuryl alcohol had an best yield when 0.1M HCl as electrolyte. Based on the results from this investigation, electrocatalytic hydrogenation with Pt/ACF is a potential strategy for ambient pressure hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol at low temperatures, and it may offer a very promising process for furfuryl alcohol production"
