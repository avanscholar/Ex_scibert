0,Introduction,"In the past, the roles of hydrogen in the anaerobic digestion process were considered a load or alarm indicator, without the energy view. However, today hydrogen is a promising candidate as an ideal and clean source of energy [1]. Anaerobic hydrogen-producing enrichment cultures have been used to produce hydrogen from organics [2]. Biological hydrogen production is more attractive if organic wastewater or other wastes could be used as raw materials. Organic wastewater and wastes contain a variety of components requiring various microorganisms to perform the degradation process. Sulfate is frequently found in some wastes produced from pulp/paper, sea-food processing and alcohol fermentation industries. These wastes contain a biomass that is a good source for biohydrogen production. However, high sulfate content adversely affects anaerobic digestion [3]. Only slight consideration has been paid to the anaerobic hydrogen producing process. Many acidogenic reactors fed on sulfate using pure cultures were reported to produce methane and only little hydrogen gas [4–6]. Recently, we found that high hydrogen production from sucrose could be obtained using enriched mixed-microflora at a high sulfate concentration of 3000mg SO 4 2 - / l at pH 5.5 and hydraulic retention time (HRT) 12h [7]. These operating conditions effectively enhanced hydrogen production by 40% in hydrogen yield (the ability converting substrate into hydrogen, HY), hydrogen production rate (the rate of hydrogen production from a fermenter, HPR) and specific hydrogen production rate (the rate of hydrogen production from a fermenter by a unit weight of biomass, SHPR) to values of 3.6mol-H2/mol-sucrose, 374mmol-H2/l-day and 90mmol-H2/g-VSS-day, respectively. These operating conditions, therefore, are considered a good strategy for producing hydrogen from sulfate-rich substrates. HRT and organic loading rate are important factors affecting biological systems. Some studies show that shortening HRT to values of 4–8h could efficiently elevate hydrogen production [8–12]. Hydrogen fermentation of a sulfate-rich biomass at proper operating HRT could effectively enhance hydrogen production. Based on the above developments, the objective of this study is to investigate the HRT and organic loading rate effects on fermentative hydrogen production at high sulfate concentration. Specifically, the process efficiency is elucidated. Sucrose is readily found in a variety of biomass-related agricultural and industrial wastes and was used as the substrate."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Seed sludge,"2.1 Seed sludge The sludge was obtained from the wasted sludge at a municipal sewage treatment plant (an activated sludge process, at Taichung). The collected sludge was screened with a No. 8 mesh (diam. 2.35mm) and was heated at 100 ∘ C for 45min to inhibit methanogen or other microorganisms bioactivity. The pH, volatile suspended solids (VSS, to express the biomass concentrations) and total solids concentrations of the seed sludge were 6.81, 33280 and 65130mg/l, respectively."
3,Substrate,"2.2 Substrate Sucrose was used as the substrate with a concentration of 20g-chemical oxygen demand (COD)/l. The substrate contained sufficient inorganics for bacterial growth ([10]; mg/l): NH4HCO3 5240, K2HPO4 125, MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O 100, MnSO 4 · 6 H 2 O 15, FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O 25 , CuSO 4 · 5 H 2 O 5 , CoCl 2 · 5 H 2 O 0.125, NaHCO3 6720."
4,Reactor operation,"2.3 Reactor operation A CSTR (continuously stirred tank reactor) bioreactor with a working volume of 4.0L was operated at a temperature of 35 ± 1 ∘ C and HRTs of 10, 8, 6, 4 and 2h (the organic loading rates are 48, 60, 80, 120 and 240g-COD/l-day, respectively) with starting-up at 12h (40g-COD/l-day). The substrate was fed in a continuous mode. The bioreactor was operated at a sulfate concentration of 3000mg SO 4 2 - / l with pH around 5.5 (favorable pH value for hydrogen production [7,8,11]). When a steady-state condition was reached and the desired data were obtained the HRT was reduced. At each run the reactor was operated for more than 10 times of the HRT to develop a steady-state condition. Steady-state conditions reached when the product concentrations such hydrogen gas content, biogas volume and metabolite concentrations were stable (less than 10% variation). For each steady-state data measurement, 6–10 samples were determined. The reactor was routinely monitored for pH, alkalinity, oxidation–reduction potential (ORP), gas production and composition, sucrose concentration, sulfate concentration, ethanol concentration, volatile fatty acid (VFA) distribution and VSS concentrations. The gas volumes were corrected to a standard temperature ( 0 ∘ C ) and pressure (760mmHg) (STP)."
5,Analyses,"2.4 Analyses The mixed liquors sampled were centrifuged ( 900 g , 15min) and the supernatants were taken for metabolite analysis. VFA and ethanol were analyzed with a gas chromatograph having a flame ionization detector (Shimadze GC-14, Japan). Biogas volume was determined by a gas meter (Ritter, Germany). Biogas composition except hydrogen sulfide was analyzed with a gas chromatograph having and a thermal conductivity detector (China Chromatograph 8700T, Taiwan). Hydrogen sulfide gas was analyzed with a gas chromatograph having a flame photometric detector (capillary column, 150 ∘ C ; injection temperature, 150 ∘ C ; carrier gas, N2). Other analytical details for the VFA, ethanol and biogas assays were the same as those in our previous study [9,13]. Turbidimetric and methylene blue methods in Standard Methods [14] were used for analyzing sulfate and hydrogen sulfide concentrations in the mixed liquor, respectively. Anthrone-sulfuric acid method was used to measure sucrose [15]. Other water quality parameters were measured according the procedures of Standard Methods [14]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Reactor performance,"3.1 Reactor performance Fig. 1 shows the daily variations in hydrogen gas content, biogas production rate, ORP and alkalinity during hydrogen fermentation at each HRT. When the HRTs were reduced, various change tendencies were observed for different monitoring parameters. For example, alkalinity and biogas production rate changed readily but obvious hydrogen gas content and ORP changes occurred only at the HRT reduction of from 4 to 2h. Quite lower hydrogen gas content and biogas production rate were observed right after the reduction of HRT from 4 to 2h. At this HRT reduction the ORP immediately increased from - 550 to - 400 mV . These ORP values were favorable to hydrogen production [16]."
8,Data under steady state conditions,"3.2 Data under steady state conditions Table 1 summarizes the experimental results obtained at each HRT for the reactor reached steady state conditions. Sucrose degradation decreased from 99.4% to 24.7% when decreasing the HRT from 10 to 2h. During fermentation, sucrose was converted into biomass, hydrogen gas and liquid metabolites. A HRT of 2h produced a high organic load rate of 240g-COD/l-day which might cause hydrogen production inhibition. A similar inhibition result was experienced for hydrogen production from glucose at a high organic load rate [12]. Another reason that sucrose degradation deteriorated at HRT 2h was biomass wash-out. The average biomass concentrations were 0.68–3.54g-VSS/l and decreased with decreasing HRT. The biomass concentration at HRT 2h was 0.68g-VSS/l, which was only 34% of that at HRT 4h. HRT of 2h seemed too short for the massive growth of hydrogen-producing cultures. The biogas production rates were quite HRT-dependent ranging from 6.6 to 41.1l/l-day. HRTs 4 and 2h exhibited the peak and least biogas production, respectively. The average hydrogen gas contents were constant (50.1–51.9%, v/v) at HRTs 10–4h but drastically reduced to 36.3% at HRT 2h. Another major gas component was carbon dioxide. Hydrogen sulfide, a fuel cell-hazardous gas, was below the detection level ( < 100 ppb ) . Hydrogen sulfide gas resulted from sulfate consumption (0.2–7.5%) by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in the hydrogenic mixed cultures. These SRB consumed sulfate using the fermentation products, VFAs and ethanol, as the electron donors [17]. The residual sulfate increased with the HRT decreased and approached to 100% with the HRT under 4h. The result could be contributed by the seed sludge after thermal pretreatment and the shortened HRT those demonstrated to benefit to the hydrogen producing microorganisms but harm to others [18,19]. Moreover, the pH value is a key factor affecting sulfate reduction and SRB are usually inhibited at pH values lower than 6 [6]. The pH values of this study were controlled around 5.5."
9,Hydrogen production,"3.3 Hydrogen production The HRT effects on microflora hydrogenic activity at high sulfate concentrations were evaluated using the variation in HY, HPR and SHPR. Fig. 2 depicts the variations in HY, HPR and SHPR at each HRT under steady state conditions. HRT-dependent hydrogen production was observed. The HY values ranged from 4.16–4.70mol-H2/mol-sucrose (at HRTs 10–4h) to 0.62mol-H2/mol-sucrose (at HRT 2h) with a peak at HRT 4h. These HY values at HRTs 10–4h were 19–34% higher than those reported for HRT 12h (3.5mol-H2/mol-sucrose) at the same sulfate concentration [7]. The HPR values were 542, 690, 738, 874 and 98.4mmol-H2/l-day and SHPR values were 155, 206 258, 432 and 146mmol-H2/g-VSS-day for HRTs 10, 8, 6, 4 and 2h, respectively. These values were 50–300% higher than those reported for HRT 12h at the same sulfate concentration [7]. Note that HRT 4h always gave much more efficient hydrogen production from peaked HY, HPR and SHPR values. A similar result has been reported that a short HRT of 6–4h resulted in peak hydrogen production for glucose and sucrose degradation without sulfate [19,20]. As discussed above, the marked decrease in hydrogen production at HRT 2h might be related to the high organic load rate and the biomass wash-out of hydrogen-producing cultures. The ORP values were decreased from - 476 to - 545 mV (Table 1) and various hydrogen production values were increased (Fig. 2) when HRT decreased from 10 to 4h. Lower ORP values generally were favorable to the biohydrogen generation and this incident was revealed to concern the accumulation of NADH [21]."
10,Variations in soluble metabolite product (SMP) concentrations,"3.4 Variations in soluble metabolite product (SMP) concentrations Hydrogen production by anaerobic degradation of organics is accompanied with SMP (VFA and ethanol) production. The average total VFA concentrations were quite HRT-dependent with 10860, 10000, 7734, 5469 and 981mg-COD/l at HRTs of 10, 8, 6, 4 and 2h, respectively. Efficient hydrogen production was always accompanied with producing a proper amount of metabolites. Low VFA concentration of 5469mg-COD/l at HRT 4h related to efficient hydrogen production at this proper operating retention time. Measuring the metabolite distribution is a good way to elucidate any metabolism shift during HRT reduction. At HRTs 10–4h, a constant metabolite distribution was obtained with acetate 13.3–17.3%, propionate 1.0–2.1%, iso-butyrate 0.7–2.5%, normal-butyrate 71.9–81.2% and ethanol 3.6–6.5% (Table 2 ). Butyrate was the major SMP and its concentrations decreased with decreasing HRT with values of 8357, 7936, 6500, 4419 to 607mg-COD/l as HRT at each HRT tested from 10 to 2h. Moreover, when the HRT was reduced to 2h, at which hydrogen production was not efficient, a marked change in metabolite distribution was experienced with acetate 27.3%, propionate 6.5%, n-butyrate 55.0 and ethanol 11.2%. At this HRT the fractions of acetate and ethanol increased obviously (almost double for both components). Based on having high hydrogen production and butyrate concentration distribution, the fermentation at HRTs 4–10h was in a butyrate type. Butyrate-type fermentation favors hydrogen production Table 3 . However, the marked increase in the ethanol concentration and a marked decrease in the hydrogen gas content at HRT 2h implied that the metabolic pathway had shifted from butyrate to ethanol-type fermentation. Propionate concentration also relates to hydrogen fermentation efficiency and should be kept at low values to have high hydrogen production [21]. At HRT 2h, a higher propionate concentration fraction was determined (6.5% vs. 1.0–2.1% at other HRTs). The propionate concentration fraction has not been reported to increase at other hydrogen fermentation rates with sulfate-free substrates at short operating HRTs. Note that a small amount of iso-butyrate (0–2.2% in metabolite fractions) was determined and decreased from 256 to 0mg-COD/l when the HRT was reduced from 10 to 2h. Iso-butyrate has been little reported in fermentative hydrogen production from sulfate-free substrates and its presence in biohydrogen production from a sulfate-rich substrate has not yet been elucidated."
11,Significance of the experimental results,"3.5 Significance of the experimental results Fig. 1 and Table 1 reveal that the biogas production rate increased from 100 to 155L/day with the HRT reduced from 10 to 4h. This suggests that at a proper HRT range decrease can enhance biogas production rate without changing hydrogen gas content. Moreover, comparing with a report value obtained at HRT 12h at the same sulfate concentration [7], although the hydrogen content was at the same level, the biogas production rate in the present study was markedly increased by 110%. The experimental data obtained at HRT 2h were low biomass concentration values, substrate degradation, biogas production rate, hydrogen gas content, HY, HPR and SHPR (Table 1 and Fig. 3 ). This indicates that HRT 2h was not a proper operating retention time. On the other hand, the experimental data obtained at HRT 4h showed peak biogas production rate and low biomass concentration and substrate degradation values (Table 1). These resulted in peak HY, HPR and SHPR values (Fig. 1), which indicate that HRT 4h was the optimal operating retention time. Compared with the reported hydrogen production values at long HRT of 12h at the same sulfate concentration (Table 1, Fig. 3, [7]), 4h HRT effectively enhanced hydrogen production in HY, HPR and SHPR by 30%, 110% and 320%, respectively. This indicates that the enhancement of hydrogen production efficiency can be obtained by properly controlling HRT. Moreover, a comparison of these hydrogen production indicator values with those of at HRT 12h without sulfate (2.57mol-H2/mol-sucrose, 269 and 58.2mmol-H2/l-day [13]), the increments of HY, HPR and SHPR were 80%, 220% and 600%, respectively. This also indicates that the presence of sulfate can efficiently enhance fermentative hydrogen production using natural mixed cultures. However, Fig. 3 reveals that a small decrease or increase from 4 h HRT markedly reduces the hydrogen production indicator values. For example, at HRT 3h, the HY, HPR and SHPR values reduced by 62%, 62% and 34%, respectively. This implies that intimate HRT control is important to obtain efficient hydrogen production. For fermentative hydrogen production using natural mixed microflora, most of these studies were at pH 5.5–6.7 [19,22]. The data obtained in this study were pH 5.5, reported as the optimal value for Clostridium species producing hydrogen from glucose [22,23]. In a pH 5.5 fermenter, hydrogenic microorganisms are reported to dominate but the SRB cannot survive [6,8,21]. Referring to these, pH 5.5 is a good value for operating a hydrogen-producing fermenter fed on a sulfate-rich substrate."
12,Conclusions,"The hydrogen fermentation at a sulfate concentration of 3g- SO 4 2 - / l is readily affected by HRT in HY, HPR and SHPR. These values could peak at HRT 4h with 4.70mol-H2/mol-sucrose, 874mmol-H2/l-day and 432mmol-H2/g-VSS-day, respectively. The metabolite concentration distribution is also HRT-dependent. Intimate HRT and pH control are important to obtain efficient hydrogen production. A HRT of 2h is too short in retention time to efficiently produce hydrogen because of substrate high load rate inhibition, biomass washout and metabolic pathway shift. Based on a biological growth comparison, pH 5.5 was considered to be the optimal value for operating a hydrogen-producing fermenter fed on sulfate-rich substrate."
