0,Introduction,"The fast depletion of fossil fuels and global climate issues have prompted researchers to consider alternative eco-friendly energy sources. Water electrolysis, which is a sustainable method for the clean production of pure H2, requires highly efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER, respectively).[1] Significant efforts have been devoted to developing high-performance HER and OER catalysts using non-precious elements to replace noble-metals, such as Pt and Ru-based catalysts.[2,3] Affordable transition-metal-and-heteroatom-doped carbon (TMC) catalysts have drawn increasing interest owing to their excellent catalytic activity, facile preparation, and high chemical stability.[4] Owing to their porous structure, tunable composition, numerous shapes and structural variants, and high C and N contents, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have evolved as promising precursors for developing inexpensive electrocatalyst.[3] MOFs have been extensively used as scaffolds to develop metal-embedded nanoporous carbons with remarkable electrochemical performance and high surface areas.[4-6] Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), a subclass of MOFs with various structures, dimensionalities, and morphological features, mainly comprise of imidazolate linkers tetrahedrally coordinated with metal ions (Zn, Co).[7] ZIFs have attracted increasing interest owing to their robust structure, chemical and thermal stability, and have been used as precursors for TMC-based materials for energy conversion.[5] Pan et al. [8] fabricated a hollow Co/NCP nanohybrid via the pyrolysis of core–shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67 polyhedra. The nanohybrid presented a low HER overpotential (η10 ) of 243 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH. The use of 3D ZIF polyhedral crystals is hindered by their slow mass transport, weak interparticle connectivity, and long diffusion pathways of the derived Co–N x –carbons.[4] Recently, researchers have focused on 2D ZIF-derived materials owing to their characteristic leaf-like morphology, high surface area, fast electron transport, and excellent active-site utilization.[3,9] Typically, 2D ZIF-L (Zn, Co) exhibits a two-dimensional layered structure with cushion-shaped cavities between layers, where L denoting leaf-like particles. The layers are stabilized by interpenetrated hydrogen-bonding interactions between monodentate methylimidazole (mIm) and free mIm ligands.[10] 2D leaf-shaped ZIF-Co-L consists of identical ZIF-67 building blocks; however its topology is different from that of 3D ZIF-67. Cheng et al. [11] used leaf-shaped 2D ZIF-Co-L as the precursor to synthesize arrays of hybrid Co@C with rich active sites and high HER catalytic activity (η10 = 171 mV) in 1 M KOH. Jingjing et al. [4] fabricated bimetallic Co-Zn ZIF nanoleaves using a “shape-transforming” method in an aqueous medium, and used them as precursors to prepare a porous Co–N x /C catalyst with excellent oxygen reduction reaction activity. However, current reports are limited to leaf-shaped ZIF-Co-L with smooth edges. Hence, it is desirable to develop 2D ZIF-Co-L precursors with favorable morphology, particularly faceted edges (oriented growth) in the leaf shape with abundant active sites to derive their morphological benefits. The electrochemical properties of ZIF-derived TMCs strongly depend on the shape and structural features of their ZIF precursors. A rational design of 2D ZIF-Co-L with a unique morphology and faceted growth is critical for enabling abundant shape-dependent active sites in ZIF-derived electrocatalysts to achieve excellent catalytic performance. Typically, 2D ZIF-Co-L with a leaf-like morphology is synthesized in an aqueous medium at 25°C using a metal-to-mIm mole ratio of 1:≤10.[10] Water molecules plays a crucial role in the formation of the 2D layered ZIF-Co-L, wherein hydrogen-bonding interactions facilitate the layer stacking. In addition, water molecules occupy the interlayers of the ZIF-Co-L structure, as indicated by the formula of ZIF-Co-L (Co(mIm)2·(HmIm)1/2·(H2O)3/2).[12,13] Hence, water (solvent) in sufficient quantity would facilitate a leaf-like morphology, whereas insufficient water would affect the structure and morphology of the resultant ZIF-Co-L by weakening the hydrogen-bonding interactions.[4] Therefore, solvent-induced effects are critical during ZIF-Co-L growth and can be used for developing novel morphologies and promoting unique phase transformations in ZIFs directly by controlling solvent volume and indirectly by incorporating functional molecules with water-trapping and water-releasing properties, which can regulate water content.[14] Graphene oxide (GO) has a layered structure similar to graphite but with attached oxygen and –OH groups in their layers, resulting in buckling of planes, and the interlayer spacing increases to 6 to 7 Å, depending on degree of oxidation during synthesis.[15] GO can accommodate guest molecules, such as water and alcohol into their interlayers owing to the chemical groups at their surface, and can also intercalate hydrated ions via strong hydrated ion–π electron interactions.[16] Hence, GO being hydrophilic, can easily be hydrated on exposure to humid air or liquid water, which increases their interlayer distance upto ~ 12 Å. [15,17] Due to these attributes, GO serve as a promising filtration membrane and ion-sieving material for water remediation owing to its excellent permeability to water molecules and tunable interlayer spacing.[16,18] Thus, GO can be used to regulate the water content of ZIF reaction mixture, leading to new morphologies and structural variants of the 2D ZIF-Co-L precursor. In this study, we synthesized a new hexagonal-shaped variant of 2D ZIF-Co-L at 25°C by tweaking the GO contents in the reaction medium. The shape of ZIF-Co-L transformed from typical leaf-like (low GO amount) to elongated hexagonal (high GO amount) driven by water-regulating properties of GO, which created a water-deficient reaction medium. Under water-deficient conditions, the constrained crystal growth of ZIF-Co-L along the a direction led to elongated hexagonal-shape variant, associated with water-driven perturbed hydrogen-bonding interactions. Subsequently, 2D ZIF-Co-L and 2D ZIF-Co-L@GO hybrids were carbonized to fabricate Co-embedded N-doped carbon (Co-NC) and Co-NC@reduced GO (rGO) electrocatalysts, and hexagonal-shaped variant of Co-NC@rGO was investigated as an excellent and durable HER electrocatalyst."

2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O; 98% purity), 2-methylimidazole (mIm; 98% purity), potassium hydroxide (reagent grade), poly (vinylidene fluoride), and Ni foam were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. GO was acquired from Standard Graphene Company, South Korea. Acetylene black was purchased from Denka, Japan. N-methyl pyrrolidone (ACS grade) was obtained from Duksan Chemicals, South Korea. All the chemicals were used as received without further purification. Ultrapure deionized water was used for all the experiments."
3,Synthesis of 2D ZIF-Co-L and 2D ZIF-Co-L@GO,"2.2 Synthesis of 2D ZIF-Co-L and 2D ZIF-Co-L@GO The 2D ZIF-Co-L@GO hybrids were prepared as follows. First, 2 mmol (0.5821 g) of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 16 mmol of mIm were dissolved in 40 mL of water each. Thereafter, appropriate amounts of GO were added to 10 mL of deionized water. The concentration of the GO dispersions was varied by increasing the GO-to-Co(NO3)2·6H2O weight ratio in the range of 10–80%. For example, the sample fabricated using a GO-to-Co(NO3)2·6H2O weight ratio of 10% was prepared by dispersing 0.0582 g of GO in 10 mL of deionized water. Subsequently, the prepared Co(NO3)2·6H2O and mIm aqueous solutions were mixed, and then the prepared GO dispersion was instantaneously added to the mixture under stirring. The reaction mixture was stirred for 3 h at 25°C. The product was collected through centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 5 min, washed with water five times, and then oven-dried at 70°C overnight to obtain violet crystals. For simplicity, the samples prepared using GO-to-Co(NO3)2·6H2O weight ratios in the range of 10–80% are denoted as ZIF-Co-L@x%GO, where x is the GO-to-Co(NO3)2·6H2O weight ratio. Pristine 2D ZIF-Co-L was synthesized using the same procedure; however, Co(NO3)2·6H2O and mIm were dissolved in 45 mL of water, and GO was not added to the reaction mixture. The Co(NO3)2·6H2O-to-H2O weight ratio of pristine 2D ZIF-Co-L was 1:154 (total water content of 90 mL)."
4,Synthesis of 2D ZIF-Co-L under water-deficient conditions,"2.3 Synthesis of 2D ZIF-Co-L under water-deficient conditions 2D ZIF-Co-L samples with low water contents were synthesized following the aforementioned procedure using 10 mL (total 20 mL) and 5 mL (total 10 mL) of water to dissolve the Co(NO3)2·6H2O and mIm precursors each, respectively, and the estimated Co(NO3)2·6H2O-to-H2O weight ratios of the fabricated samples were 1:34 and 1:17, respectively."
5,Synthesis of 2D Co-NC and 2D Co-NC@rGO,"2.4 Synthesis of 2D Co-NC and 2D Co-NC@rGO 2D Co-NC and 2D Co-NC@rGO were fabricated via single-step pyrolysis of ZIF-Co-L and ZIF-Co-L@x%GO, respectively, at 900°C for 2 h at a heating rate of 5°C min−1 under an Ar atmosphere. The Co-NC@rGO samples fabricated via carbonization of the ZIF-Co-L@x%GO precursors are denoted as Co-NC@xrGO-leaf or Co-NC@xrGO-Hex., where leaf and Hex. denote leaf-like and hexagonal morphologies."
6,Electrochemical characterization,"2.5 Electrochemical characterization Electrochemical measurements were performed using a Parstat electrochemical workstation with a three-electrode configuration. Ni foam, graphite rod, and Hg/HgO electrode were used as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively, and 1 M KOH solution was used as the electrolyte (pH 13.6). Electrocatalyst paste prepared by adding catalyst (80 wt%), acetylene black (10 wt%), and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (10 wt%) to N-methyl pyrrolidone solvent and was coated onto the working electrode (geometrical area of 1 cm2) and dried at 100°C for 12 h. All the potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The raw potentials (ERaw ) were iR-corrected (where i is the current, and R is the electrolyte resistance) using the uncompensated series resistance determined from the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the samples (Ecorrected = ERaw − iR). The EIS profiles were acquired at potentials corresponding to the ƞ 10 values of the samples in the frequency range of 105–0.01 Hz. The long-term stability of each fabricated electrocatalyst was determined via chronoamperometry (CA) at a potential corresponding to a current density of 15 mA cm−2. The electrochemical active surface areas (ECSA) of the electrocatalysts were estimated from the double layer capacitance (Cdl ) which was determined from their respective cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves at different scan rates in the non-faradaic region."
7,Material characterization,"2.6 Material characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis was performed using a 3D high-resolution EMPyrean/PANalytical XRD instrument with Cu Kα radiation at a step size of 0.01° in the 2θ range of 10–80°. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses were performed using a Hitachi S-4800 apparatus and a FEI Tecnai F20 (200 kV) device, respectively, at the Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI), Gwangju Center, South Korea. Raman spectra were collected using a Horiba Jobin Hyon ARAMIS instrument with a backscattering geometry at the KBSI. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed using an VG Multilab 2000 spectrometer with an Al target anode for X-ray generation. The X-ray photon energy (Al Kα) was 1480 eV with a line width of 0.5 eV. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer 400 instrument with KBr pellets in the wavenumber range of 400–4000 cm−1 at the Center for Development of Fine Chemicals, Chonnam National University, South Korea. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas of the electrocatalysts were determined from their N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms collected at 77 K using a Belsorp mini analyzer. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) profiles of the samples were acquired using a Shimadzu DTG-60H instrument under an air atmosphere, in the temperature range of 0–900°C, and at a heating rate of 10°C."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Shape transition to hexagonal ZIF-Co-L,"3.1 Shape transition to hexagonal ZIF-Co-L A new rational approach was used to regulate the morphology of 2D ZIF-Co-L by manipulating its GO content, and the crystal growth mechanism was analyzed. Typically, the 2D ZIF-Co-L precursor was synthesized via a simple coprecipitation reaction from aqueous solutions of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and mIm precursors, as reported in Section 2.2.[19] ZIF-Co-L@GO hybrids were synthesized by adding aqueous GO dispersions to the violet-colored ZIF-Co-L reaction mixture shortly after the precursors were mixed. The effect of GO on the shape evolution of 2D ZIF-Co-L in the ZIF-Co-L@x%GO (x = 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80) was evaluated. The changes in shape of 2D ZIF-Co-L on the ZIF-Co-L@x%GO with increasing GO content were monitored using FESEM (Fig. 1 ). Pristine ZIF-Co-L presented a leaf-like morphology with smooth, round edges, and an average layer thickness of 220 nm, which was consistent with previously reported data (Fig. 1 a and b).[19] The ZIF-Co-L@10%GO, ZIF-Co-L@20%GO, and ZIF-Co-L@30%GO samples retained a leaf-like morphology (Fig. 1 c–e). The morphology of ZIF-Co-L@40%GO changed significantly from round-edged leaf-like to elongated hexagonal-shaped crystals. This indicated that GO, a functional additive played a significant role in the shape evolution of ZIF-Co-L hybrid materials (Fig. 1 f). ZIF-Co-L@60%GO and ZIF-Co-L@80%GO retained the elongated hexagonal shapes (Fig. 1 g–i). A consistent change in morphology of the synthesized ZIF-Co-L@GO hybrids from leaf-like to elongated hexagonal crystals by varying the GO content, facilitates the advent of novel ZIF@GO hybrid precursor with unique morphologies for developing efficient electrocatalyst. The morphology of ZIFs is usually correlated directly to their crystal structure and dimensionality, unless a topotactic transformation from one ZIF form to another is induced.[5] Typically, 2D ZIF-L (Co, Zn) presents a leaf-like morphology, whereas 3D ZIF-67 (Co) and ZIF-8 (Zn) comprise truncated polyhedron-shaped crystals.[5] The new elongated hexagonal-shaped crystals are unique to ZIF-Co-L or any other ZIFs, or to another partially transformed mixed ZIF-Co-L@ZIF hybrid. An extensive literature survey retrieved only two reports on elongated hexagonal-shaped 2D ZIF-L, which were synthesized via heterovalent doping (Cu+ and Ce3+ ions) of the Zn-based 2D ZIF-L structure.[20,21] The distinct hexagonal morphology of ZIF-L was not considered or discussed in that report, because ZIF-L was used only as a precursor to fabricate electrocatalysts for the water reduction reaction.[20,21] Recently, Sujeong et al. [22] fabricated a hollow hexagonal-shaped 3D ZIF-8 structure using a leaf-shaped 2D ZIF-L template via topotactic phase transformation, through the secondary growth of ZIF-8 over a ZIF-L template, using zinc nitrate and mIm precursor solutions. Hence, the shape transition of leaf-shaped ZIF-Co-L to elongated hexagonal variant, which was achieved by adjusting the GO concentration, was unique and can be promising precursor for the Co-based electrocatalyst. Further the effects of pH and thickness of 2D ZIF-Co-L crystals with varying GO contents were evaluated. Subsequently, changes in the thickness of the leaf-like and elongated hexagonal-shaped ZIF-Co-L on ZIF-Co-L@GO crystals with increasing GO content were estimated (Fig. 1 j, Fig. S1 , Supporting information ). The average thickness of the as-formed ZIF-Co-L layers indicated significant and irregular changes in ZIF-L thickness with increasing GO content. The thickness of the GO sheet was neglected when calculating the thickness of ZIF-Co-L, since our goal was to understand the effect of the GO content on the ZIF-Co-L morphology. The layer thickness of pristine leaf-like ZIF-Co-L layers was ~220 nm thick, which was consistent with the literature.[19] The ZIF-Co-L@10%GO crystals presented the thickest ZIF layer (~466 nm) of all the samples. Upon increasing the GO content to 20 and 30 wt%, the thickness of the ZIF layer decreased to ~420 and ~295 nm, respectively, and the samples retained a leaf-like morphology. As the GO content was increased to 40 wt%, thickness of the ZIF layer decreased to ~176 nm, which was the thinnest among all the samples; in addition, the shape of the sample crystals changed from leaf-like to elongated hexagonal-shaped. Further increase in the GO content to 60 and 80 wt%, the ZIF layer thickness increased to ~450 nm and then decreased to ~320 nm, respectively. The atypical changes in layer thickness of the synthesized ZIF@GO hybrids and associated morphological changes with increasing GO content were anticipated to changes in pH of the GO dispersion. Hence, the changes in pH of the GO dispersions used to synthesize ZIF@GO hybrids were summarized in Fig. 1 k and Table 1 . The abundant functional groups (i.e., carboxyl/carbonyl groups at the edge plane and hydroxy/epoxy groups at the basal plane) of the GO sheets rendered the aqueous GO dispersions highly acidic (pKa 4.3), in addition to pKa values of 6.6 and 9.0.[23] As expected, the prepared 10% GO (5.82 mg mL−1) dispersion that was added to the ZIF precursor mixture was highly acidic (pH 2.50). Upon increasing the GO content to 30%, 40%, and 80%, the dispersions became increasingly acidic, and their pH decreased to 2.08, 1.76, and 1.60, respectively (Table 1). However, after the addition of GO dispersion to ZIF-Co-L reaction mixture, the resultant pH ranged from ~8.70 to 8.25 after 2 min and did not alter much even after 3 h stirring (Table 1). Furthermore, the changes in shape and thickness of the ZIF-Co-L@GO hybrids were evaluated using PXRD, Raman spectroscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy, and XPS analyses."
10,"Structural, chemical, and surface analysis of GO-modified hexagonal-shaped ZIF-Co-L","3.2 Structural, chemical, and surface analysis of GO-modified hexagonal-shaped ZIF-Co-L The PXRD profiles of the ZIF-Co-L@GO hybrids are presented in Fig. 2 a. A highly crystalline 2D ZIF-Co-L phase with orthorhombic structure and Cmce space group with a chemical formula of Co(mIm)2·(HmIm)1/2·(H2O)3/2 was observed in all the samples (Fig. 2 a).[12,24] Upon increasing the GO content from 10 to 80 wt%, the PXRD peak intensities of ZIF-Co-L@GO hybrids reduced gradually owing to the decrease in ZIF-L content. A new broad amorphous peak at 9.5° emerged in the PXRD profile of ZIF-L@40%GO, which downshifted in the ZIF-L@60%GO (9.4°) and ZIF-L@80%GO (8.8°). The amorphous peak was more intense than the main (004) peak of the ZIF-Co-L phase in the ZIF-L@80%GO. The amorphous peak did not match with characteristic PXRD peak of GO at ~11.9° (Fig. 2 a). The new amorphous peaks in the 2θ range of 8.8–9.5° were assigned to the intercalated GO derived from the insertion of water molecules, increasing the interlayer spacing of the GO sheets.[15,17] Typically, the interlayer spacing of layered materials, such as GO, is sensitive to the presence of guest molecules in the interlayer region.[25] The PXRD profiles of the ZIF-L@GO hybrids namely ZIF-L@10%GO, ZIF-L@20%GO possess similar interlayer spacing (7.4 Å) to that of pure GO, which increased to 9.3, 9.5, and 10 Å for ZIF-L@40%GO, ZIF-L@60%GO, and ZIF-L@80%GO, respectively. The intercalation of a monolayer of water molecule causes the lattice of GO to expand by 2.2 – 2.5 Å, that matches with the increase in interlayer distance from 7.4 to 10 Å in the ZIF-L@x%GO (x = 0 to 80).[26] Further the possible restacking of GO sheets at higher GO concentration did not affect the insertion of water molecules into their interlayers.[16] To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the precise control of the interlayer distance of GO sheets (upto 10 Å) in the ZIF reaction media, and these intercalated GO can be promising candidates in developing GO membranes for heavy metal ion sieving. In addition, the main (004) Bragg reflection of ZIF-Co-L upshifted with increasing GO content, suggesting a decrease in the interlayer spacing of 2D ZIF-Co-L along the c axis attributed to the loss of water molecules between the 2D ZIF layers. The (004) reflection corresponded to the interlayer spacing of the layered ZIF-L structure connected via hydrogen bonds along the c axis (Fig. 1 j).[27] Hence, it was concluded that the water molecules in the ZIF reaction mixture were transferred to the interlayers of GO, which eventually caused a decrease in the interlayer spacing of 2D ZIF-Co-L. The ideal intercalation of water between the GO layers occurred at a critical GO concentration, was related to the amount of GO added to the ZIF reaction mixture that caused a forceful intercalation between the GO layers. Further, we conclude that acidity of GO is not responsible for the morphology change of ZIF-Co-L@GO.[28] Any further increase in GO content above 80 wt% was challenging owing to the experimental limitations in dispersing large amounts of GO in the selected volume of solvent (10 mL). Hence, it is understood that the water accessibility for the reaction of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and mIm precursors affected the morphology transformation of the ZIF-Co-L@GO hybrid to elongated hexagonal-shape by adjusting the GO content, which regulated the water content. Therefore, the hexagonal-shaped morphology of the ZIF-L@GO hybrids with faceted growth can facilitate the development of shape-dependent Co-based electrocatalyst for the HER. To further evaluate the shape changes of ZIF-Co-L@GO induced by water-regulated GO, FT-IR spectroscopy was employed (Fig. 2 b). The characteristic vibrational bands of imidazole ring were present in the pristine ZIF-Co-L, where the bands in the wavenumber range of 1350–1500 cm−1 were associated to the entire ring stretching. [22,29] The bands in the wavenumber range of 900–1350 cm−1 were assigned to the in-plane bending of the imidazole ring, whereas those at wavenumbers below 800 cm−1 were ascribed to the out-of-plane bending of the imidazole ring.[30] The prominent peak at ~427 cm−1 was assigned to the vibration of the Co–imidazole-N bonds, which downshifted, indicating the weakening of the Co–N bonds in the ZIF-Co-L network ( Fig. S2 , Supporting information ). [31] The intensities of the characteristic ZIF-Co-L@GO bands decreased with increasing GO content owing to the decrease in ZIF-Co-L content. Upon increasing the GO content to 40 wt%, the band positions of the in-plane and out-of-plane bending modes remained unchanged, suggesting negligible interactions between GO and ZIF-Co-L molecules or their existence as separate entities. As the GO content was increased beyond 40 wt%, a broad peak emerged in the wavenumber range of 900–1100 cm−1 owing to the stretching of the C–O bonds of GO.[31] Furthermore, the presence of intercalated water molecules was evaluated using the vibrational bands in the wavenumber range of 3000–3750 cm−1. Water used as the solvent during the synthesis of ZIF-Co-L played a crucial role in the formation of ZIF network by facilitating the formation of hydrogen bonds (N–H···N) between free mIm rings with uncoordinated NH groups and monodentate mIm rings. Upon introducing GO to the reaction mixture, water accessible for the ZIF reaction decreased, causing weakening of hydrogen bonds, would lead to an increase in the number of free NH of mIm. The increase in number of free NH groups with peaks in the range of 3350–3500 cm−1 with increasing GO content from 0 to 60 wt% [32] confirmed that water regulated effect of GO, which subsequently affected the hydrogen-bonding interaction between ZIF-Co-L layers. The characteristic bands of NH groups at >3000 cm−1 were no longer observed for the ZIF-Co-L@80%GO, owing to the significant increase in GO content suppressing the NH signal. Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy was used to analyze the interactions between 2D ZIF-Co-L and GO. The Raman spectrum of pristine ZIF-Co-L included the signals of Co–N bonds (262, 322 cm−1), mIm rings (692 cm−1), C–N bonds (1139, 1192 cm−1), C–C bonds (1455 cm−1), ring C–H bonds (1510 cm−1), and methyl C–H bonds (2928 cm−1) as shown in Fig. 2 c [33]. The D and G bands of GO in the Raman spectra of ZIF-Co-L@10%GO and ZIF-Co-L@40%GO emerged at 1353 and 1598 cm−1, respectively, and the characteristic peaks of ZIF-Co-L were completely suppressed. The ID/IG ratio increased from 0.94 for pristine ZIF-Co-L to 1.07 for ZIF-Co-L@10%GO and 1.32 for ZIF-Co-L@40%GO, suggesting an increase in number of defect sites caused by the water molecule intercalated into the GO interlayers. Moreover, XPS analysis was used to evaluate the binding interactions of the ZIF-Co-L@GO hybrids and were presented in Fig. 2 d and e. The surface elemental composition of the samples determined using XPS data revealed a significant increase in O content from pristine ZIF-Co-L to ZIF-Co-L@10%GO. Moreover, the O content of the ZIF-Co-L@x%GO samples with x = 10, 20, 30, 40, and 80 was almost constant. The C content of the ZIF-Co-L@x%GO samples increased linearly with increasing GO content ( Fig. S3 , Supporting information ). The decrease in Co content from 10 to 80 wt% was assigned to the increase in GO content. The peak at 781.3 eV in the high-resolution Co2p XPS profile of pristine ZIF-Co-L corresponded to the Co–N bonds[3] and downshifted with increasing GO content from 10 to 80 wt%. This indicated the weakening of Co–N bonds and partial formation of Co–O bonds, which confirmed the confined water molecules at the GO interlayers in presence of GO (Fig. 2 d).[3] By contrast, the main N1s, O1s, and C1s peak positions remained unchanged with increasing GO content. However, the C1s peaks in the high binding energy (BE) range of 285–288 eV broadened, indicating the presence of oxygenated carbon species (C–O, C = O) of the O-based functional groups of GO (Fig. 2 e).[34] Hence, the insertion of water molecules at the GO interlayers by trapping water molecules from the reaction mixture, was responsible for the shape transition of elongated hexagonal ZIF-Co-L variant."
11,Shape transition induced by water-deficient ZIF-Co-L reaction mixtures,"3.3 Shape transition induced by water-deficient ZIF-Co-L reaction mixtures To further verify the GO-driven shape transition via regulating the amount of available water, pristine ZIF-Co-L was synthesized by decreasing the water volume from 90 to 20 and 10 mL, which translated into an increase in the Co(NO3)2·6H2O-to-H2O weight ratio from 1:154 to 1:34 and 1:17, respectively. Hexagonal-shaped crystals were observed in the FESEM images of the water-deficient ZIF-Co-L, fabricated using Co(NO3)2·6H2O-to-H2O weight ratios of 1:34 (Fig. 3 b and e) and 1:17 (Fig. 3 c and f); whereas leaf-shaped crystals were observed in the pristine ZIF-Co-L fabricated from Co(NO3)2·6H2O-to-H2O weight ratio of 1:154 (Fig. 3 a and d). These results confirmed that the GO-regulated water in the reaction mixture was responsible for the shape evolution of elongated hexagonal-shaped ZIF-L variant. The controlled crystal growth of ZIF-Co-L under water-deficient conditions proceeded along the edges of the plane of the leaf-like structure. Further, a significant change in the thickness of hexagonal-shaped ZIF-Co-L under water-deficient condition was anticipated to the pH of the reaction mixture with a Co(NO3)2·6H2O-to-H2O weight ratio of 1:17 (11.2) being higher than that of the Co(NO3)2·6H2O-to-H2O weight ratio of 1:154 (8.5) (Table 2 ), suggesting that pH played a significant role in the size or thickness of ZIF-Co-L. Furthermore, the PXRD profiles of the 2D ZIF-Co-L synthesized under water-deficient conditions were same as those of pristine 2D ZIF-Co-L, confirming that the crystal structure was retained (Fig. 3 g). Moreover, the (004) reflection of the ZIF-Co-L synthesized under water-deficient environment upshifted for the Co(NO3)2·6H2O-to-H2O weight ratio of 1:17. These changes were similar to those observed in the PXRD patterns of ZIF-Co-L@GO samples (Fig. 2 a) and further confirmed that GO trapped the water molecules from the ZIF-Co-L reaction media, mimicking the water-deficient synthesis conditions."
12,Mechanistic insight into the synthesis of GO-induced hexagonal ZIF-Co-L variant,"3.4 Mechanistic insight into the synthesis of GO-induced hexagonal ZIF-Co-L variant The shape transition of leaf-like ZIF-Co-L to elongated hexagonal-shaped ZIF-Co-L was explained based on the crystallographic and bonding interactions attributed to the regulating effect of water at the GO interlayers. ZIF-Co-L exhibits a 2D layered structure with a leaf-shaped morphology. Cushion-shaped cavities are present between the stacked layers, which are connected via hydrogen bonds along the c axis.[12] Water remains an integral part of ZIF-Co-L lattice as indicated from their chemical formula. (Co(MeIm)2·(HMeIm)1/2·(H2O)3/2).[12] The crystallographic structure of ZIF-Co-L is determined by the directional growth of leaf-like particles (inset of Fig. 1 j). The typical ZIF-L unit consists of two types of asymmetric crystallographic Co sites, four types of mIm ligands, and one “free” HmIm molecule.[12] The Co2+ ions adopt a tetrahedral symmetry wherein the Co1 ions are coordinated to the N16, N16, N26, and N26 μ2-bridging N atoms of the mIm units and the Co2 ions are coordinated to the N15, N25, and N35 atoms of three mIm units and N45 atom of a monodentate mIm unit (Fig. 4 a). Six μ2-bridging mIm ligands are bonded to two Co1 ions in opposite directions along the ab plane of the structure; furthermore, four Co2 ions form a large hexagon, and four μ2-bridging mIm ligands bind two Co1 and two Co2 ions, forming a small parallelogram. The parallelograms and hexagons are interconnected to create a 2D layer network along the ab plane, while the 2D layers are stacked along the c direction. Furthermore, the N atoms of monodentate mIm (N46) form hydrogen bonds with the H atoms of free mIm (N55) (–N···H–N), which are the basis for layer stacking along the c axis (Fig. 4 b).[12] The crystallographic orientation of ZIF-Co-L is associated to their morphological characteristics. The ab plane of ZIF-Co-L structure is associated with the basal plane of the leaf-shaped particles, wherein longest corner-to-corner length of the leaves is oriented along the b axis and width of the leaf-shaped particles is oriented along the a axis.[27] Typically the reaction of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and mIm precursors in aqueous medium, is preceded by the hydrogen bond formation between the amine-N atom of monodentate mIm ligands and H atoms of water molecule (solvent) as shown in Fig. 4 c.[10] Such hydrogen bonds further serve as bridges for inducing the formation of N···H–N hydrogen bonds between the amine-N atoms of monodentate mIm and H atoms of free mIm ligand, and these hydrogen bonds link the sodalite layers to form the 2D ZIF-Co-L structure (Fig. 4 c).[14] Any changes in the water content controls the hydrogen bond formation along the c axis which would dictate the crystal growth along the ab direction of the crystals. Hence, the strength and nature of hydrogen bonds in ZIF-Co-L affect crystal growth and morphology of the leaf-like crystals. Water-regulated shape variation of ZIF-Co-L can be achieved directly by reducing the amount of water as solvent or indirectly using functional materials that can trap or release water molecules during reaction. In this study, GO was successfully used as a functional additive to trap water molecules that could regulate the shape of ZIF-Co-L precursor. Owing to its adjustable interlayer spacing, GO serve as an energy-efficient material with numerous potential applications including water desalination and purification and gas and ion separation.[18,35] GO tends to swell upon immersion in the aqueous solutions by absorbing water molecules, and its interlayer spacing would increase and can reach upto ~12 Å.[16] Hence, a water-deficient reaction medium was achieved in presence of suitable GO contents, hindered the hydrogen bond formation in the ZIF-Co-L, as evidenced using PXRD, FT-IR spectroscopy, and XPS analyses, and this restricted the crystal growth along the a direction of the leaf-like crystals owing to weak hydrogen-bonding interaction (Fig. 4 c). Crystal growth along the b direction of the leaf-like crystals was unaffected owing to their fast growth and non-essential hydrogen-bonding interactions.[27] Hexagonal-shaped ZIF-Co-L were fabricated by quickly adding GO dispersions to the ZIF-Co-L reaction medium to obtain a violet-colored dispersion. Leaf-shaped ZIF-Co-L were fabricated in the absence of GO or using a GO content of less than 30 wt%. By contrast, hexagonal crystals were fabricated using GO contents of ≥ 40 wt%, and their synthesis was driven by water-deficient reaction conditions, which were achieved when GO trapped water into its interlayer spacing. The increase in the interlayer spacing of GO from 7.4 Å for ZIF-L@10%GO, ZIF-L@20%GO, and ZIF-L@30%GO to 9.3 and 10 Å for ZIF-L@40%GO and ZIF-L@80%GO, respectively, confirmed the GO trapping of water molecule leading to increase in the GO interlayers (Fig. 4 d). Hence, the critical GO content can be efficiently used to alter the shape of ZIF-Co-L by regulating the amount of reaction water. The synthesis of the unique hexagonal-shaped 2D ZIF-Co-L variant using an appropriate GO content is promising for the fabrication of high-performance Co-NC electrocatalysts for the HER. Co-NC-leaf, Co-NC@10rGO-leaf, and Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. electrocatalysts were synthesized by carbonizing ZIF-Co-L, ZIF-Co-L@10%GO, and ZIF-Co-L@40%GO, respectively at 900°C for 2 h under an Ar atmosphere. Carbonization transformed ZIF-Co-L and GO into Co-NC and rGO respectively, thereby forming Co-NC anchored onto rGO sheets. The phases and crystalline nature of the fabricated carbon materials were subsequently characterized via PXRD. The PXRD patterns of the carbonized samples were similar (Fig. 5 a) and included diffraction peaks corresponding to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of face-centered cubic metallic Co (PDF #01–089-7093), the (002) planes of hexagonal carbon (PDF #01-075-1621), and the (311) plane of trace of spinel cubic Co3O4 (PDF #01-080-1534). A significant narrowing of the peak corresponding to the (111) plane of metallic Co occurred with increasing GO content from 10 to 40 wt%, suggesting the cobalt aggregation in GO hybrid materials. By contrast, the peak broadening of (002) plane of carbon indicated the formation of amorphous carbon with increasing GO content, particularly in Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. The characteristic D and G bands of carbon at 1350 and 1580 cm−1, respectively, were present in the Raman spectra of all the samples, including pristine ZIF-L, indicating that C was also formed via the carbonization of the ZIF-Co-L precursor (Fig. 5 b). The ID/IG ratio of Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. (0.76) was lower than that of Co-NC@10rGO-leaf (0.92), indicating a higher graphitization degree or lower defects in the hexagonal crystals. The ID/IG ratio of Co-NC-leaf was 0.75. Moreover, a second-order band (2D) at ~2700 cm−1 was observed for Co-NC-leaf, and the I2D/IG ratio can provide insight into the number of graphene layers. [36,37] Co-NC@leaf, with a high I2D/IG ratio of 0.70, comprised multi-layered graphene, whereas Co-NC@10rGO-leaf and Co-NC@40rGO-Hex., with lower I2D/IG ratios of 0.36, comprised bulky graphene sheets owing to the aggregation of GO in the ZIF-Co-L precursor.[38] N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were used to analyze the pore structure of the fabricated Co-NC samples. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of Co-NC, Co-NC@10rGO-leaf and Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. exhibited typical type-IV hysteresis loops, indicating their micro/mesoporous nature (Fig. 5 c).[4] Conversely, pristine Co-NC-leaf exhibited higher characteristic of microporous materials. The microporous nature of Co-NC-leaf was further confirmed by the sorption properties of Co-NC-leaf at low pressure region and its pore size distribution with abundant pores with a diameter of ≤ 2 nm (Fig. 5 d).[39] The specific surface areas of Co-NC-leaf, Co-NC@10rGO-leaf, and Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. were ~250, 113, and ~89 cm−3 g−1, respectively. The pore size distribution curves indicated that Co-NC@10rGO-leaf and Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. contained more mesopores than Co-NC-leaf. The surface area of microporous Co-NC-leaf, which was derived from pristine ZIF-Co-L, was higher than those of mesoporous Co-NC@10rGO-leaf and Co-NC@40rGO-Hex., which were derived from GO-containing ZIF-L precursors.[40] Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed to compare the amount of carbon of Co-NC@10rGO-leaf, and Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. with that of Co-NC-leaf. Two weight loss regions were observed in the TGA profile of Co-NC-leaf. The first weight loss of ~2%, which occurred below 240°C, corresponded to the elimination of adsorbed water. The second weight loss of 32.7%, which occurred in the temperature range of 280–500°C, was attributed to the combustion of carbonaceous materials and decomposition of Co in air.[41] The differential thermal analysis (DTA) results indicated that an endothermic process that occurred in the temperature range of 280–500°C was associated with multiple phase transitions from Co(0) to CoO(II) and Co(II, III)3O4 (Fig. 5 e). The weight loss above 600°C was negligible. The TGA profiles of Co-NC@10rGO-leaf, and Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. were similar to that of Co-NC-leaf; however, the weight losses of Co-NC@10rGO-leaf, and Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. in the temperature range of 320–500°C were 35.8% and 45.8%, respectively, indicating that the net rGO contents of Co-NC@10rGO-leaf, and Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. were ~3% and 13%, respectively (Fig. 5 f). The thermal stability of Co-NC@10rGO-leaf, and Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. was higher than that of Co-NC-leaf, as indicated by the TGA and DTA results ( Fig. S4 , Supporting information ). The formation of Co-NC-leaf, Co-NC@10rGO-leaf, and Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. was subsequently analyzed using FESEM and TEM (Fig. 6 ). According to the FESEM image of Co-NC-leaf, the carbonized sample retained the leaf-like morphology of the pristine ZIF-Co-L precursor; moreover, the leaf-like particles presented slightly rough surfaces, which formed upon releasing CO2 and H2O gas molecules during carbonization (Fig. 6 a). The TEM images of Co-NC-leaf illustrate the leaf-like particles with sizes in the range of 2–3 µm and the homogeneous distribution of ultrafine Co nanocrystals in the porous N-doped carbon matrix (Fig. 6 b and c). The lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of ~2.0 Å, which were ascribed to the (111) plane of metallic Co nanocrystals. (inset of Fig. 6 b). The (311) plane of Co3O4 with a d-spacing of ~2.4 Å is also observed. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of Co-NC-leaf further confirmed the high crystallinity of the sample (Fig. 6 d), and the elemental mappings of Co-NC-leaf revealed the uniform distribution of Co, C, and N throughout the sample (Fig. 6 e–g). The FESEM image of Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. indicated that the sample retained the elongated hexagonal shape of the ZIF-Co-L@40%GO precursor and revealed the porous structure of the surface of Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. (Fig. 6 h). The TEM images of Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. revealed the presence of hexagonal crystals of ZIF-derived Co-NC, with well-dispersed Co nanocrystals in the carbon matrix (Fig. 6 i). Moreover, lattice fringes with a d-spacing of ~2.03 Å, corresponding to the (111) plane of metallic Co were observed in the high-resolution TEM image of Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. (inset of Fig. 6 j). The SAED pattern of Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. contained fewer bright spots than that of Co-NC-leaf, indicating that Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. was relatively less crystalline than Co-NC-leaf (Fig. 6 k). Furthermore, elemental mapping analysis (Fig. 6 l–n) indicated the homogenous distribution of Co, C, and N in the Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. crystals. Co-NC@10rGO-leaf, exhibited a leaf-like morphology similar to that of Co-NC-leaf, with a uniform distribution of Co, C, and N ( Fig. S5 , Supporting information ). The surface chemical composition and N doping contents of the carbonized samples were evaluated using XPS analysis. The XPS survey scans of Co-NC-leaf, Co-NC@10rGO-leaf, and Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. revealed the presence of Co, C, N, and O on the catalyst surfaces (Fig. 7 a). Moreover, the XPS data revealed that the N/C ratio of Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. was slightly higher than that of Co-NC-leaf. The N content of Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. (~5.3 at.%) was higher than those of Co-NC@10rGO-leaf (~3.9 at.%) and Co-NC-leaf (~2.5 at.%) because the availability of carbon/graphene for N doping of Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. was higher than those of the other samples (Table 3 ). The mIm ligands of the ZIF-Co-L precursor featuring C–N bonds served as the N source because they decomposed during carbonization. The prominent bands in the BE ranges of 775–792 eV and 794–810 eV in the high-resolution Co2p XPS profiles of Co-NC-leaf and Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. were assigned to Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2, respectively (Fig. 7 b). The metallic Co and surface-oxidized Co peaks emerged at 779.2 and 781.4 eV, respectively, corresponding to Co2p3/2 species. The N1s XPS profiles of Co-NC-leaf, Co-NC@10rGO-leaf, and Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. can be fitted into three types of N species, viz., pyridinic-, graphitic-, and pyrrolic-N, and their corresponding peaks were observed at ~398.5, 400.6, and 399.7 eV, respectively (Fig. 7 c). The high content of pyridinic-N of the samples was favorable, because pyridinic-N atoms can form active sites (N–C) by themselves or coordinate with Co atoms to form Co–N x –C sites for efficient HER (Table 4 ).[42] Metallic Co is a well-known catalyst for the graphitization of amorphous carbon derived from organic ligands. The graphitization of imidazole ligands caused C–N bond breaking, resulting in the low N content of Co-NC-leaf. Conversely, the higher N content of ZIF-Co-L@GO was attributed to the high stability of the ZIF precursor in presence of GO, which can retain numerous C–N bonds during carbonization. This was further confirmed by the increase in N-doped carbon (C–N bond at 285.8 eV) is apparent in the rGO samples (Fig. 7 d). In addition, the peaks at 284.6, 287.3, and 289.3 eV in the C1s XPS profiles indicated the presence of sp2-C atoms, N–C=O bonds, and C=O bonds, respectively. The O1s XPS profiles revealed the presence of Co–O bonds (530 eV), indicating that the samples contained minors amount of Co3O4 and surface oxide species, Co–OH bonds (531.2 eV), and adsorbed H2O (533.5 eV) (Fig. 7 e). The HER catalytic performance of Co-NC-leaf, Co-NC@10rGO-leaf, and Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. coated on Ni foam supports was evaluated using a 1 M KOH solution as the electrolyte, and the results were compared with those of commercial Pt/C catalyst and bare Ni foam. The Tafel slopes of Co-NC-leaf, Co-NC@10rGO-leaf, and Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. were determined by plotting the Tafel equation: η = a + b × log|j|, where η, a, b, and j are the overpotential at 10 mA cm−2, intercept, Tafel slope, and absolute value of the current density, respectively, and were used to study the mechanism of the HER activity of the electrocatalysts. The LSV polarization curves of the electrocatalysts were obtained at 5 mV s−1 after uncompensated iR correction (Fig. 8 a). Co-NC@10rGO-leaf exhibited the highest HER activity of all the analyzed electrocatalysts, requiring an η 10 of 220 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The η 10 value of Co-NC@10rGO-leaf was 10 mV lower than those of Co-NC-leaf and Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. (Fig. 8 a). The low η 10 of Co-NC@10rGO-leaf was attributed to the suitable rGO content (~3 wt%) forming a Co–rGO interface. The rGO content of Co-NC@10rGO-leaf was much lower than that of Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. (~13 wt%), as indicated by the TGA results (Fig. 5 f). The catalytic activity of Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. was relatively lower than that of Co-NC@10rGO-leaf owing to the lower Co-to-carbon/rGO content which decreased the net content of catalytically active Co(0) species of the catalyst. Despite its high rGO content (~13 wt%), the η 10 value of Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. was similar to that of Co-NC-leaf. The η 10 value of Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. was theoretically calculated to be 200 mV ( 87 × 230 100 ) by neglecting its high rGO content (~13 wt%) and considering the catalyst content to be 87 wt%. This was higher than the η 10 value of Co-NC-leaf (230 mV), which did not contain carbon. If the carbon content of Co-NC@10rGO-leaf (~3 wt% rGO content and experimental η 10 of 220 mV) was considered to be 3 wt%, the η 10 value of Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. was estimated to be ~197 eV ( 87 × 220 97 ) which was lower than that of Co-NC@10rGO-leaf. The estimated mass activities of the catalysts indicated that Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. outperformed Co-NC@10rGO-leaf and Co-NC-leaf as a HER catalyst, owing to the unique hexagonal shape of its ZIF-Co-L@40%GO precursor. To determine the precise role of hexagonal morphology on the HER performance of Co-NC@40rGO-Hex., we attempted to remove rGO from Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. via annealing in air at 700°C to form Co3O4 and subsequent reductive annealing for oxidic conversion to metallic Co. However, we faced significant experimental challenges, involving the formation of excess nonreducible Co3O4, which hindered the estimation of the real catalytic activity of Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. The Tafel slope of Co-NC@10rGO-leaf (128 mV dec−1) was lower than those of Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. (146 mV dec−1) and Co-NC (161 mV dec−1), indicating a rapid charge transfer kinetics for the HER process in alkaline media (Fig. 8 b). A faster HER kinetics of Co-NC@40rGO-Hex., than Co-NC-leaf with a lower Tafel slope, further confirming the exceptional activity of Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. Tafel slopes in the range of 120–162 mV dec−1 suggest that water electrolysis follows a Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism, involving the following steps: H2O + e− → Hads + OH− (Volmer step, rate determining step) and H2O + Hads → H2 (g) + OH− (Heyrovsky step).[43,44] The high HER electrocatalytic activity of Co-NC@10rGO-leaf was attributed to the synergistic effects of the ultrafine active Co nanocrystals, suitable content of rGO, and N dopant, which can improve the electrical conductivity of the catalyst and provide numerous active sites.[43] The EIS profiles of the catalysts (Fig. 8 c) offered further insight into their excellent HER activity. The Nyquist curves revealed that the charge transfer resistance (Rct ) of Co-NC@10rGO-leaf (3.3 Ω) was lower than those of Co-NC-leaf (4.0 Ω) and Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. (3.9 Ω). This indicated the formation of a Co–rGO interface, which facilitated charge transfer at the catalyst–electrolyte interface and corroborates with the excellent HER activity (lowest η 10 of 220 mV) of Co-NC@10rGO-leaf. Moreover, the Rct value of Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. (3.9 Ω) was slightly lower than that of Co-NC-leaf (4.0 Ω). Despite the low content of catalytically active metallic Co particles (87 wt%) and high rGO content (~13 wt%) of Co-NC@40rGO-Hex., its high charge transfer was mainly attributed to its hexagonal morphology with exposed Co sites and also to the high N dopant content (~5 at.%), which improved catalyst conductivity. To determine the number of catalytically active sites for the HER, the ECSAs of the catalysts were evaluated using the corresponding Cdl values determined from their CV curves (Fig. 8 d, and Figs. S6 and S7 , Supporting information ). Catalysts with large ECSA values possess abundant catalytically active sites and present high catalytic performance. Cdl is linearly related to the effective ECSA of catalysts.[45] The CV curves of Co-NC@10rGO-leaf were acquired in the non-faradaic region of 0.13–0.23 V vs. RHE, and the Cdl value of Co-NC@10rGO-leaf was calculated at 0.18 V vs. RHE. The slope of the plot of the difference in current density (ΔJ = Janodic − Jcathodic) vs. the scan rate was equal to 2Cdl (Fig. 8 d). Therefore, the Cdl values of Co-NC@10rGO-leaf and Co-NC-leaf were 21.8 and 19.6 μF cm−2, respectively, suggesting that the number of catalytically active sites for the alkaline HER of Co-NC@10rGO-leaf was higher than that of Co-NC-leaf. These results were in agreement with the LSV data (Fig. 8 a and e). Conversely, the Cdl value of Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. was the lowest among all electrocatalysts in this study owing to its rGO content (~13 wt%) being higher than those of Co-NC-leaf and Co-NC@10rGO-leaf and masking the catalytically active metallic Co sites. The HER performance of Co-NC@10rGO-leaf and Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. in an alkaline medium was higher than those of several literature-reported metallic Co-based carbon catalysts, namely carbon nanotube (CNT)/Co-phthalocyanine (η10 = 221 mV),[46] Co/N-doped carbon particles (η10 = 243 mV),[8] Co/N-doped CNT particles (η10 = 245 mV),[8] Co@N-doped porous carbon (η10 = 259 mV),[47] Co-N-doped graphdiyne (η10 = 280 mV),[48] and Co with N-doped graphene (η10 = 337 mV)[49] (Fig. 8 f and Table 5 ). Stability is an important criterion for the practical applicability of electrocatalysts. CA measurements were performed to evaluate the long-term (10 h) durability of the catalysts in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Co-NC-leaf and Co-NC@10rGO-leaf retained ~89% and ~ 82%, respectively, of their initial current densities, after 10 h of continuous operation (Fig. 8 g). By contrast, Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. retained only ~60% of its initial current density after 10 h. Co-NC@20rGO-leaf was also analyzed, and its stability was lower than that of Co-NC-leaf ( Fig. S8 a–c, Supporting information ). The actual rGO contents of Co-NC@10rGO-leaf, Co-NC@20rGO-leaf, and Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. were determined to be ~3, ~7, and ~13 wt%, respectively, using TGA data ( Fig. 5 f and Fig. S9 , Supporting information ). These results indicated that the stability of the catalysts decreased with increasing rGO content. Furthermore, the trend in overpotential drift of the LSV curves acquired after a 10 h stability test was similar to that of change in the current density (Fig. 8 g), further indicating that an increase in rGO content led to a decrease in catalyst stability (Fig. 8 h). To understand the stability of the Co-NC@rGO catalysts, post-stability analyses, namely morphological and chemical composition analyses, were performed via SEM and XPS, respectively ( Fig. S10 , Supporting information ). The SEM images illustrated that the catalysts retained their morphological features after the stability test. In addition, the small hexagonal plates in the size range of 1–2 μm observed in post-CA catalysts were attributed to the hydroxylation of Co nanoparticles (NPs) to cobalt hydroxide, even under reductive HER conditions in the alkaline media.[50] The post-CA XPS profiles of the catalysts confirmed the formation of cobalt hydroxide, as evidenced by the O1s (531.3 eV) and Co2p (781.5 eV) XPS peaks ( Fig. S10 e and f, Supporting information ). Furthermore, the post-CA SEM and XPS results indicated that the amount of cobalt hydroxide increased with increasing rGO content of the hybrid catalysts irrespective of morphology. This suggested that rGO induced Co NP hydroxylation during CA favoring the formation of cobalt hydroxide as byproduct. The conversion of metallic Co to cobalt hydroxide is detrimental to the HER performance of catalysts because cobalt hydroxide exhibits poor electronic conductivity and poisons the catalytically active metallic Co sites.[51-53] The high OH− content of the catalysts, which was attributed to the presence of cobalt hydroxide, inhibited the desorption of OH species, which is necessary for the H2 adsorption step of the HER.[53] The excellent electrocatalytic performance of Co-NC@10rGO-leaf and Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. was attributed to the following aspects. (i) Hexagonal-shaped ZIF-Co-L@40%GO and leaf-like ZIF-Co-L@10%GO served as promising precursors for fabricating ultrafine Co/N-doped carbon/graphene electrocatalyst with abundant active sites, fast mass transport, and high charge transfer properties for the HER. (ii) The Co-carbon hybrid catalysts derived from the hexagonal-shaped and leaf-like variants of the ZIF-Co-L precursors combined the advantages of efficient Co-NC active sites, high graphitization, and high N dopant content. (iii) Micron-sized ZIF crystals, which served as a scaffold for GO, favored a suitable carbon content with well-dispersed active sites and Co nanoparticles. (iv) The HER activity of Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. was lower than that of Co-NC@10rGO-leaf because of the difference in rGO content, rather than morphology effects. The higher carbon content of Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. (~13 wt%) than that of Co-NC@10rGO-leaf (~3 wt%) inhibited the HER catalytic activity of Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. with fewer catalytically active Co NPs than Co-NC@10rGO-leaf. Therefore, leaf-like and hexagonal-shaped Co-embedded N-doped carbon electrocatalysts with high nitrogen contents, excellent conductivity, and abundant active sites were fabricated using GO-modified 2D ZIF-Co-L as molecular precursors."
13,Conclusion,"A new hexagonal-shaped 2D ZIF-Co-L variant was fabricated by tweaking the GO content in the reaction mixture. GO served as a shape-directing agent by regulating the amount of water in the ZIF reaction medium. The water-absorbing capacity of GO under spontaneous water inflow into their interlayers was adjusted to facilitate the shape transformation to hexagonal-shaped ZIF-Co-L under water-deficient conditions. Crystal growth along the a direction of the hexagonal-shaped ZIF-Co-L variant was restrained compared with that of typical leaf-like ZIF-Co-L owing to the suppressed hydrogen-bonding interactions driven by the amount of water molecules. Furthermore, the fabricated hexagonal-shaped and leaf-like 2D ZIF-Co-L@GO hybrid precursors were converted into high-performance Co-NC@rGO electrocatalyst for the HER. Co-NC@10rGO-leaf exhibited remarkable HER catalytic activity in alkaline media delivering a low η10 of 220 mV and presenting excellent Tafel kinetics with facile H2 evolution and high durability for ~10 h. Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. delivered a η10 of 230 mV, and its slightly higher η10 value was attributed to the high rGO content (13 wt%) compared with that of Co-NC@10rGO-leaf (~3 wt%), rather than the shape effect. The outstanding performance of Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. and Co-NC@10rGO-leaf hybrid catalysts toward the HER was attributed to the synergistic effect of the ultrafine Co NPs, high N content, and abundant catalytic sites; robust structure; stable shape; fast charge transfer; and high intrinsic catalytic activity of the highly porous the N-doped 2D-carbon/graphene nanosheets. The new hexagonal variant hybrids fabricated using 2D ZIF-Co-L and 2D GO can serve as promising desalination membranes for ion-sieving and water purification applications owing to the dual complementary effect of the large interlayers spacing of GO (≤10 Å) and small ZIF-Co-L interlayers (≤5 Å). We believe that the synthesis approach proposed in this study can be used to fabricate new metal-embedded carbon-based catalysts for electrocatalytic water splitting."
