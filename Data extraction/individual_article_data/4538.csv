0,Introduction,"Antibiotics are types of antimicrobial substances that are extensively utilized in therapy and prohibition of infections, and also as growth promoters in creatures, and veterinary and domestic uses (Klein et al., 2018). The global application of antibiotics has increased continuously during recent years due to elevation in their consumption and other parts of trading enterprises (Klein et al., 2018). For instance, antibiotic usage in chattels reached by 63,151 tons in 2010 and is forecasted to increase by 67% by 2030 (Van Boeckel et al., 2015). Among the antibiotics, amoxicillin (AMX) is a penicillin antibiotic relating to the β-lactam group (Matta et al., 2019) and is the most commonly consumed antibiotic in the world (Matta et al., 2019), which has the lowest metabolism among medicines (Matta et al., 2019). AMX properties cause many unwanted effects, including the low ability of biological decomposition, high toxicity, and providing drug resistance (Matta et al., 2019). Due to the excessive utilization of antibiotics in various sectors, these compounds are now found in large quantities in wastewater treatment plants (Rizzo et al., 2013). In addition, as antibiotic contamination is imperfectly managed on regional and universal scales, antibiotic molecules are progressively detected in tellurian and aquatic environments (Boy-Roura et al., 2018). Also, excessive utilization and misuse of definite antibiotics have led to noxious environmental influences and have risen humans҆ health dangers (Grigorakis and Rigos, 2011). Various methods have been tested to decrease antibiotic concentration from water or wastewater, including adsorption (Li et al., 2017), ozonation (Lu et al., 2019), photocatalytic approaches (Li and Shi, 2016), and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) (Chu et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019). In the last decades, AOPs have been utilized to decrease and mineralize medicinal and organic pollutants in water into simple products (Han et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021). AOP is a simple, low-cost, and highly efficient technique (Khan et al., 2018). The majority of AOPs depend on the production of active oxidizing components like hydroxyl radicals (Khan et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2021). The aid provided by a catalyst is a principal item for advancing catalytic efficiency (Jia et al., 2005). Zeolite has been used as a catalyst or the agent supporting nanoparticle catalysts due to its valence for ionic interchange (Akhmedov and Al-Khowaiter, 2007; Han et al., 2019), high durability, and non-production of secondary pollutants (Matta et al., 2019; Han et al., 2020). Remarkable interspersed metals in the zeolite are utilized to apply hydrogenation-dehydrogenation activity and thus, supply acidity for the formation of the catalyst (Pliekhov et al., 2020). Numerous kinds of zeolites like β- and Y- types have been surveyed as a surface for catalyst dispersal (Zhang and Smirniotis, 1999; Deldari, 2005). Catalytic ozonation of penicillin G (PG) via cerium-loaded natural zeolite is a cost-effective and efficacious procedure for removing high concentrations of PG in the solution (Zhang et al., 2020). Also, AU-type zeolite has been evaluated for the degradation of ofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole antibiotics (79%) from aqueous solutions (de Sousa et al., 2018). Seawater contains inorganic ions like Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, I+, SO4 2−, and Br− (Yang et al., 2015). Many of the seawater ions have catalytic properties if properly processed. So far, catalysts have been prepared from waste sludge produced by shipping docks (containing sea salt) and have been used to remove AMX (Damiri et al., 2020), phenol (Khoshtinat et al., 2021), and cephalexin (Tavasol et al., 2020, 2021). However, sea salt has not been used to modify catalysts. The ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) is used as an important chemical in different pharmaceutical industries, laboratories, food industry, toxicity treatment, plating, and agriculture. This substance is biodegradable and non-toxic for aquatic animals. The Fe(II)-EDTA has been shown to catalyze the CaO2 system for treatment of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) (Si et al., 2018). Furthermore, it has been found that dealumination with EDTA provides a completely controllable, foresighted, and safe process of Al leached from the zeolites’ structures (Pliekhov et al., 2020). Advantages of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in contrast with periodate, persulfate, and chlorine are proper storage and oxidation power of OH• and OOH• radicals, which can oxidize organic compounds once diffused in water (Pazda et al., 2019). Degradation of tetracycline in a schorl/H2O2 has been investigated at a low H2O2 dose (Zhang et al., 2018). H2O2 plays a major role in reducing and mineralizing sulfamethazine (Huang et al., 2019). As the salinity of seawater is nearly 3.4% (w/w) (Yang et al., 2015), the main goal of this research was promoting the catalytic activity of zeolite Y using sea salts. Therefore, specific objectives of this work were (I) optimizing the production process of zeolite Y-sea salt catalyst for the decomposition of AMX in the presence of H2O2, (II) evaluating the effect of operating factors (pH and quantity of catalyst, H2O2, and AMX), (III) removing AMX from various media (distilled water, urine, urban water, and wastewater) using the developed system, and (IV) investigating kinetics, reusability, and AMX degradation pathway."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and solutions,"2.1 Materials and solutions AMX (C16H19N3O5, 99.99%) was acquired from the Kosar Medicinal Company (Iran). The stock solution of AMX was provided with a concentration of 0.01 g in 100 mL of double-distilled water. Due to probable reaction and volatilization of AMX, the solution was prepared daily before experiments. H2O2 (30% m/v), isopropyl alcohol, methanol, humic acid (HA), fulvic acid (FA), NaOH, and HCl were obtained from the Merck Company (Germany). Also, zeolite Y was provided from the Alfa Aesar Company (USA). EDTA (C10H16N2O8, 99.5%) was purchased from the Kimia Exir Chemical Company (Iran). Sea salt was taken from water of the Persian Gulf, in Bushehr Port (Bushehr Province, south of Iran). About 20 L of seawater was prepared from the northern shores of the Persian Gulf (at a geographical location of 28.9234 N, 50.8203 E) for the whole experiment. The seawater was filtered through a cloth filter to remove turbidity."
3,Synthesis and optimization of zeolite-sea salt catalyst,"2.2 Synthesis and optimization of zeolite-sea salt catalyst EDTA binds to divalent ions (such as calcium and magnesium) and precipitates at high pH. The precipitated material was used to rectify the framework of the zeolite. To do this, 2 g of EDTA was added to 100 mL of seawater, and pH was adjusted to 13.0 by adding NaOH to make more amounts of the precipitate. Then, the solution was placed for 1 h to make two phases (transparent and opaque). The transparent phase was extracted and was added to 100 mL of double-distilled water and 2 g of zeolite and then, pH was adjusted on 13.0 and the slurry was shaken for 1 h in a shaker incubator. Afterward, the slurry was filtrated and dried in the oven at 105 °C for 24 h. Because, furnace temperature was the first variable, the dried materials were heated at (200–500 °C) for 2 h. Each of the catalysts obtained at the desired temperature was assessed to treat AMX under the following conditions: “catalyst dose: 2 g.L−1, reaction time: 60 min, AMX concentration: 100 mg.L−1, and pH of 6.0” in order to determine optimal temperature. Meanwhile, the time duration in the furnace was surveyed to achieve the optimized catalyst as shown in Table S1."
4,Experimental design and procedure,"2.3 Experimental design and procedure Different parameters, including solution pH (5.0–9.0), dosage of catalyst (0–10 g.L−1), AMX concentration (50–300 mg.L−1), reaction time (10–130 min), and concentration of H2O2 (0–6 mL/100 mL) were studied to evaluate their effect on AMX degradation. In the beginning, experiments were followed by finding the optimized pH. Then, runs continued to find the optimized dose of catalyst, reaction time, AMX concentration, and H2O2 concentration, respectively. Meanwhile, the effect of various cations, anions, and organic matter (ETDA, HA, and FA) with a concentration of 50, 100, and 200 mg.L−1 was also surveyed. In another part, AMX was removed from different matrices (urine, distilled water, and sewage) under optimal conditions (pH of 6.0, AMX concentration: 100 mg.L−1, reaction time: 100 min, H2O2 concentration: 0.1 mL/100 mL, and catalyst dosage: 7 g.L−1). The effect of radical scavengers (methanol and isopropyl alcohol) was explored under the following conditions: solution pH of 6.0, AMX concentration of 100 mg.L−1, catalyst quantity of 7 g.L−1, reaction time of 100 min, and scavenger concentration of 200 mg.L−1. For performing catalyst reusability tests, the used zeolite-sea salt catalyst was first washed with acetonitrile, ethanol, and distilled water and then was dried at 50 °C overnight. Reusability tests were performed under optimal conditions (pH of 6.0, AMX concentration: 100 mg.L−1, reaction time: 100 min, and catalyst dosage: 7 g.L−1). Removal efficiency (%) of the AMX was computed based on the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal and via Eq. (1): (1) Efficiency, % = ( [ C O D ] i n i t i a l − [ C O D ] t i m e t [ C O D ] i n i t i a l ) × 100 The COD test included a reactor for measurement (HACH Company, DRB200) and a photometer for preparation (HACH Company, DR900). This test has already been used to evaluate the elimination of antibiotics (Damiri et al., 2020; Mashayekh-Salehi et al., 2020)."
5,Measurements,"2.4 Measurements For characterization of the catalyst before and after being used in reactions and also raw zeolite, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), mapping, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were applied. The surface morphology of the samples was specified by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) using SIGMA VP scanning electron microscope, ZEISS Company (Germany). Speciﬁc surface characterizations of the samples were done via BET device (BET, BElSORP Mini model, Microtrac Bel Corp Company) at 180 °C. Functional groups were analyzed using FTIR device (FTIR- 4600typeA) over a wavenumber of 0∼4000 cm−1. For identifying crystal framework, XRD (X-ray diﬀraction, X’ Pert Pro apparatus, Panalytical Company) patterns were provided at a 2θ° range of 5–80. Chemical combination was evaluated by EDX (Energy-dispersive X-ray, Oxford Instrument, England) coupled with mapping experiments. TGA (thermogravimetric analyzer, Rheometric Scientific device, STA 1500 Company, TGA model, USA) was performed at 800 °C under air atmosphere (30 mL min−1) for combustion. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC- MS) (GC-MSD, Agilent Technologies) was used to distinguish the intermediate of AMX degradation under the optimized conditions. The pHZPC parameter was measured to survey the surface charge of the catalyst (zeolite-sea salt). For assigning pHZPC, 0.3 g of the optimal catalyst was added in 100 mL of distilled water and was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. NaOH and HCl (1 M) were used to regulate the initial pH levels of 4.0, 5.0, 7.0, 12.0, and 13.0. After the desired time, the initial and final pH of the samples was evaluated using a digital pH meter (Mettler Toledo) and the curve was depicted against the initial pH levels."
6,Statistical analysis,2.5 Statistical analysis All the tests were repeated three times and their mean was presented with standard deviation. The deviation of the two values was <5%. Statistical analysis was done by subjecting the data to the Mann-Whitney U test using the SPSS software version 20 at a 95% of confidence level.
7,Results and discussion,
8,Optimization process of the catalyst,"3.1 Optimization process of the catalyst According to Fig. 1 (a), as the temperature was increased, the degradation rate was more elevated. Increased degradation efficiency with the increase in furnace temperature (in catalyst production) can be related to the expansion of the catalysts҆ crystal lattice and reconstruction of bonds (Kaur et al., 2018). A temperature of about 500 °C is required to form a crystalline structure and higher temperatures reduce the catalyst surface. Also, at this temperature, the catalyst has the highest surface area and an appropriate number of active parts (Wang et al., 2020). In general, an excessive increase in furnace temperature, in any case, reduces catalytic activity. At temperatures above 500 °C, particle aggregation may be faster or higher, which in turn reduces the catalytic activity of the catalyst (Senobari and Nezamzadeh-Ejhieh, 2020). According to the scientific literature, at very high temperatures, micro-structures of zeolite change and the number of acidic sites is decreased (Liu et al., 2020). Also, at 600 °C, it was found that compaction was formed and particle size was increased greatly, resulting in catalyst sintering, which reduced surface area and volume of the cavity. This intense condensation prevents mass transfer and leads to a decrease in catalytic activity (Yu et al., 2020). At 400 °C, a decrease in catalytic activity was observed, which is attributed to doping with some intermediates formed to increase the recombination rate (Makki et al., 2020). At lower temperatures of 200 and 300 °C, no significant activity was observed. The inhibitory effect becomes weakened at low temperatures and the possibility of trapping intermediates is reduced (Liu et al., 2020). As depicted in Fig. 1(b), the most degradation rate was detected at 4 h. Less removal in a short time (1 h) could be due to imperfect transformation and also, less removal within 3 h is linked to particle association (Abdullah and Chong, 2010). Meanwhile, the effect of heated zeolite and unheated zeolite was also studied. It was found that the heated zeolite had better efficiency than the unheated one, which might be related to the formation of lanthanide metal-like types in the zeolite. Metal imides or metal-like types in zeolite Y may influence its catalytic properties (JoongáKim, 1992). Being in the furnace for a long time causes less catalytic activity due to the high probability of producing dense particles (Senobari and Nezamzadeh-Ejhieh, 2020). Short residence time in the furnace also reduces efficiency due to not providing a suitable surface for the catalyst (Isa et al., 2021). There was no considerable difference (p-value > 0.05) in the efficiency of catalysts obtained at residence times of 2–4 h and for saving energy, a residence time of 2 h was used to produce catalysts and perform further tests."
9,Characterization of the optimized catalyst,"3.2 Characterization of the optimized catalyst The results of surface characteristics (FE-SEM, EDX, and mapping) are shown in Fig. 2 (a–f) and Figs. S1(a–c). According to Fig. 2(a and b), it can be understood that the elements in crude zeolite were only oxygen, silicon, and aluminum. However, based on Fig. 2(c and d), in addition to these three elements, metals, such as iron, copper, zinc, zirconium, vanadium, and magnesium also exist in the catalyst, originating from sea salt in the catalyst. Comparing the micrographs obtained from the FE-SEM test, it was observed that filamentous particles are formed on the surface of the used catalyst, which can indicate the presence of remaining drug or by-products on the surface. An enhancement in the percentage of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon in the EDX result of the used catalyst compared to the fresh one could be another confirmation regarding the presence of the drug residue (or its intermediates) on the catalyst surface. The findings of the TGA test are shown in Fig. S2(a). According to Fig. S2(a), zeolite does not have significant weight loss due to ceramic structure. The slight weight loss observed in the sample is dependent on the evaporation of water in the formation process. Weight dissipation in fresh and used samples of zeolite-sea salt catalyst at temperatures below 200 °C was almost equal. At this temperature, water is absorbed on the surface as well as structural water located between the zeolite layers, and in both samples, about 7% of the material mass is reduced (Musyoka et al., 2015). At temperatures between 200 and 400 °C, weight loss is related to the rupture of hydroxyl links during the dehydroxylation process (Musyoka et al., 2015). It was observed that after this temperature, the weight loss of the catalyst was greater in the used sample in drug decontamination. Weight dissipation at temperatures upper than 400 °C is related to the thermal disintegration of organic compounds present in the internal structure of the catalyst. Therefore, further weight dissipation was observed in the reacted sample, reflecting adsorption of the remaining drug (or its degraded by-products) to the catalyst surface. Changes in the crystal structure of the catalyst before and after AMX removal are shown in Fig. S2(b). According to Fig. S2(b), in the crude zeolite, the diffraction pattern of the Al2O3 crystal structure can be seen with the reference code of 98–006-2965. The diffraction plates corresponding to each peak in this diffraction pattern are marked on the same peak. However, in the zeolite-sea salt catalyst, the diffraction pattern corresponding to natural zeolite (clinoptilolite with reference code of 00-047-1870) was specified. These peaks have been also detected in other studies (Zamani et al., 2013; Beycioglu et al., 2016) and are linked to natural zeolites. As can be seen, the XRD patterns are almost identical for the two catalyst samples (reacted and unreacted). The diffraction plates corresponding to each peak are shown in the XRD pattern. Carefully comparing the peaks, it was found that after removal reaction; the intensity of the peaks was decreased slightly, which might be related to coating of the AMX molecules on the catalyst surface. The crystalline size (D, nm) of the studied catalysts was determined using Scherer's equation (Eq. (2)) shown below (Zeleke and Kuo, 2019): (2) D = K λ / B cos ( θ ) In this equation, λ is the X-ray wavelength (here, equals 1.54 Å), K is the shape factor (almost equals 0.9), B is peak width at half-height, and θ is peak location. The crystallinity value was calculated to be 463.10, 410.82, and 444.05 nm for zeolite Y, fresh zeolite-sea salt, and the used zeolite-sea salt, respectively. The increase in crystallinity after the removal process may be due to the presence of antibiotic compounds on the investigated catalyst. The FTIR spectra of the studied zeolite Y, zeolite-sea salt catalyst before and after elimination of AMX are presented in Fig. S2(c). According to Fig. S2(c), the peaks conspicuous at wavenumbers of 3412 cm−1 and 3626 cm−1 correspond to extensile vibration of O–H and N–H bonds in the catalyst, respectively (Javidparvar et al., 2020). The peak that appeared at 1631 cm−1 is related to the bending vibration of O–H groups in the catalysts҆ framework (Khosravi et al., 2018). The peaks appeared at wavenumbers of 111 cm−1, 1062 cm−1, 671 cm−1, and 452 cm−1 are related to flexural vibration of C–H bond (Harfouche et al., 2017), tensile vibration of O–Si–O bond (Javidparvar et al., 2016), tensile vibration of Si–O–Al bonds (Li et al., 2019), and bending vibration of Si–O–Si (Li et al., 2019), respectively. Also, in the crude zeolite, peaks that appeared at wavelengths less than 650 cm−1 are related to symmetrical tensile vibration, tensile vibration of six-membered rings, and flexural vibration of silicon oxide and aluminum oxide bonds (Ke et al., 2019). Thus, it can be concluded that the permeability of these bonds is reduced after the elimination of AMX, which may be due to placement of this drug on the used catalyst. Also, in this spectrum, it was observed that after exposing the catalyst to drug-containing media, a new peak appeared at 1728 cm−1 belonging to carbonyl groups (CO) in chemical structure of AMX and confirming placement of the drug on the catalyst surface (Li et al., 2019). Fig. 3 shows the BET analysis of crude zeolite, modified zeolite by sea salt (before reaction), and zeolite-sea salt catalyst after the reaction. As can be seen, the BET surface of zeolite (2.33 m2g−1) was increased 5.4 folds after modification with sea salt (12.69 m2g−1). Increasing surface provides a greater chance for catalyzing the AMX removal reaction. Size of the pores of raw zeolite and reacted catalyst was equal to 8.74 and 25.08 nm, respectively, which is consistent with findings of the previous works (Hidayat et al., 2018). The amount of specific surface area and volume of cavities did not differ significantly for fresh and used catalysts (p-value > 0.05), indicating the strong structure of the catalyst. Since the diameter of the catalysts҆ pores (zeolite and zeolite-sea salt catalyst) falls within the range of 2–50 nm, so the studied materials are mesoporous. The type of adsorption-desorption isotherm for zeolite and catalyst (before and after use) belongs to group IV, corresponding to mesoporous materials. The hysteresis ring is almost identical in all three cases (zeolite and catalysts) and is associated with clay and zeolites with the plate and aggregated particles."
10,The effect of operational parameters,"3.3 The effect of operational parameters 3.3.1 Solution pH The rate of chemical reactions depends on pH and directly or indirectly influences the oxidation process. According to the results depicted in Fig. 4 (a), elimination of AMX was decreased as the solution pH was increased, showing that removal efficiency under acidic conditions was favorable than alkaline and neutral ones. Molecular charge of AMX depends on different functional groups, such as carboxyl (pKa1 = 2.68), amine (pKa2 = 7.49), and phenolic hydroxyl (pKa3 = 9.63). At pH < pKa1, the positive charge of AMX determines molecular charge (Anastopoulos et al., 2020). At a pH level between pKa1-pKa2, carboxyl group deprotonation and neutral AMX are predominant (Anastopoulos et al., 2020). For values between pKa1-pKa3, the deprotonated form of carboxyl and amine groups is predominant. Finally, at pH > pKa3, deprotonation of phenolic hydroxyl is more considered and the AMX molecule is negatively charged (Anastopoulos et al., 2020). At pH levels between 3.0 and 6.0, AMX is in a neutral state, allowing it to penetrate the catalyst structure. At pH > 6.0, it has been found that removal of AMX is decreased by the developed system, which is related to the charge of AMX (Anastopoulos et al., 2020). At pH 6.0, carboxylic groups of AMX are gradually separated, creating a net negative charge on the molecule (Anastopoulos et al., 2020), which causes abduction of AMX by the catalyst and, as a result, increases removal efficiency. It is noteworthy that the decrease in removal efficiency at alkaline pH may be due to competition between hydroxyl ions and ions present on active parts (Dehghani et al., 2018). A high pH value always leads to a low ●OH oxidation potential therefore, its ability to attack AMX molecules becomes weakened (Zhang et al., 2017). Also, as pH is increased, the number of OH− groups is increased, indicating a decrease in the positive charge of AMX at binding sites and consequently, a decrease in removal efficiency (Khosravi et al., 2018). Removal efficiency was insignificantly higher at pH 5.0 than pH 6.0 (p-value > 0.05). Therefore, a pH of 6.0 was used for subsequent tests. 3.3.2 Quantity of catalyst The results of the catalyst quantity effect are presented in Fig. 4(b). It is notable that with the increase in the catalyst dose, removal became more significant (Fig. 4(b)), which could be related to the increment in the existing surface area for the generation of hydroxyl radicals (Damiri et al., 2020). According to Fig. 4(b) and also based on results of statistical analysis, there was an insignificant difference between the catalyst doses of 7 and 10 g.L−1 (p-value < 0.05). So, the catalyst dose of 7 g.L−1 was chosen as the optimized dose to have a cost-effective process. It should be noted that there was still a major difference between the doses of 5 and 7 g.L−1 (p-value > 0.05), and as a result, the dose of 5 g.L−1 was not used for subsequent tests. As indicated in Fig. 4(b), the amount of AMX adsorption by the catalyst was also investigated. The amount of adsorption was increased by increasing catalyst quantity. This may be due to an increase in accessible surfaces to absorb AMX. At an optimal catalyst dose of 7 g.L−1, uptake was ∼20%. 3.3.3 AMX concentration and contact time The results regarding the effect of AMX concentration and contact time are shown in Fig. 4(c). Degradation had the best efficiency at the lowest concentration and longest time. As can be observed, when the concentration is increased and as contact time is considered shorter, removal of antibiotic would be insignificant. It has been shown that as the concentration is increased, inadequate amounts of radicals generated by H2O2 completely eliminate the pollutant (Liu et al., 2018). 3.3.4 Content of H2O2 The influence of H2O2 on AMX elimination is depicted in Fig. 4(d). When the concentration was increased from 0.1 to 6 mL/100 mL, the elimination rate was decreased significantly. This should be related to the verity that surplus H2O2 can act as an ●OH scavenger based on the following reaction (Deng et al., 2018). (3) · O H + H 2 O 2 → H O 2 · + H 2 O Though scavenging reactions generate different radicals (e.g., HO2 ●), they are entirely unreactive in comparison with ●OH for degradation of the majority of organic pollutants in aqueous solutions (Deng et al., 2018). Therefore, according to Fig. 4(d), the maximum removal efficiency was obtained at 0.1 mL/100 mL of H2O2, confirming that if the amount of H2O2 is lower, then removal will be more significant."
11,"Co-existence of cations, anions, and organic matter","3.4 Co-existence of cations, anions, and organic matter The results regarding the effect of different cations on AMX elimination are presented in Fig. S3(a). A high concentration of Mg2+ had a reverse influence on AMX elimination, leading to an increase in the amount of OHˉ produced during the degradation process, which in turn leads to the subsequent formation of magnesium deposits. These deposits are accumulated on the surface of the catalyst and prevent the activity of catalyst particles (Yang et al., 2015). According to Fig. S3(a), as the concentration was increased, the removal efficiency was decreased. Therefore, it can be said that the existence of Al3+ ions may damage the surface of the catalyst and prevent the availability of useful catalysts҆ components for a radical generation (Yang et al., 2020). According to the results, as the concentration of K+, Ca2+, and Na+ was increased, removal had reverse efficiency, indicating the existence of metal cations that prohibit recombination of hole-electrons (Li et al., 2017). The effect of co-existing anions on AMX removal was studied and the results are presented in Fig. S3(b). Results showed that the AMX elimination was reduced considerably in the existence of PO4 3− and SO4 2− (Eqs. (4) and (5)) (Dehghani et al., 2018). In the presence of NO3 − and Cl−, a light decrease was achieved in AMX removal, which could be due to ionic radii. Ionic radii of Cl−, PO4 3−, NO3 −, SO4 2−, and Br− are equal to 0.181, 0.238, 0.179, 0.230, and 0.196 nm, respectively (Dehghani et al., 2018). The ionic radii of PO4 3− and SO4 2− are larger than the other two anions and NO3 − and Cl− have negligible differences (Eq. (6)) (Dehghani et al., 2018). Also, surface charge densities of PO4 3− and SO4 2− are higher than other studied ions; thus, they are more adsorbed onto the catalyst surface. Overall, it was found that SO4 2− has a higher inhibitory influence on catalytic degradation than Cl− and Br−. These ions influence the adsorption of the pollutant and also play the scavenging role of hydroxyl ions. It has been revealed that Cl− and SO4 2− are adsorbed on the catalyst surface and hinder the progress of the reaction (Dehghani et al., 2018). Also, Cl− displayed a negative effect on antibiotic removal, explicated by the two aspects: (I) the HSO− 5 could merge with a little concentration of Cl− to form HOCl and Cl2 through Eqs. (7) and (8) (Ghanbari et al., 2020); (II) Cl− reacted with SO4 ●ˉ to produce Cl●, in which Cl● continued to react with another Cl− to generate chlorine radical (Cl2 ●ˉ) (Eqs. (9) and (10)) (Xu et al., 2019). Br− did not have a significant effect on AMX degradation and there was no significant difference between Br− containing samples and the blank one (p-value > 0.05). (4) P O 4 3 − + O H · → P O 4 3 − · + O H − (5) S O 4 2 − + O H · → S O 4 2 − · + O H − (6) N O 3 − + O H · → N O 3 − · + O H − (7) C l − + H S O 5 − → S O 4 2 − + H O C l (8) 2 C l − + H + + H S O 5 − → S O 4 2 − + C l 2 + H 2 O (9) C l − + S O 4 · − → S O 4 2 − + C l · (10) C l · + C l − → C l 2 · − The results of AMX degradation in the presence of EDTA, HA, and FA are depicted in Fig. S3(c). Both HA and FA can have an adverse effect on AMX degradation (Ashok et al., 2016). As the HA concentration was increased, elimination was decreased notably, which can be due to electrostatic interplays related to HA involving O-containing functional groups (carboxyl and phenolic groups) and aromatic fractions, H- linking, and π-π (Yang et al., 2014). FA has been shown to noticeably reduce the elimination of AMX through interplays of carboxyl groups with hydrogen links on the catalyst (Xu et al., 2018). Simultaneously, the noxious electrostatic scope would be presented around the adsorbed FA molecules, which would considerably influence the removal of AMX (Fu et al., 2013). Based on Fig. S3(c), as the EDTA concentration was increased, AMX degradation was increased remarkably from 81 to 89%, revealing that EDTA concentration is directly related to degradation. It was found that when the concentration was increased from 50 to 200 mg.L−1, AMX removal was increased, which could be related to a lower reaction of HO● with EDTA or effective radical production in the presence of a high concentration of EDTA (Miao et al., 2015)."
12,Different matrixes,"3.5 Different matrixes Based on Fig. S (4), the antibiotic removal was effective from all three studied environments (wastewater, urine, distilled water, and urban water). Mean removal efficiency of AMX from distilled water was not significantly different from urine and urban water, while for distilled water and wastewater, the difference was statistically significant (p-value < 0.05), implying that in very complex environments, such as wastewater, removal efficiency decreases, possibly due to the presence of degradation-resistant compounds or radical scavengers (Stucchi et al., 2018)."
13,Kinetics of AMX degradation,"3.6 Kinetics of AMX degradation The findings for kinetic modeling are provided in Table S2. R2 values of the pseudo-first-order kinetic model for AMX elimination in the zeolite-sea salt/H2O2 system were higher than other evaluated models. Thus, our data were well-matched to the first-order kinetic model. Also, based on the results, the elimination rate was faster for lower AMX concentrations than higher ones. Similar results have been found by other researchers (Pezoti et al., 2016; Demirezen et al., 2019) for the elimination of AMX."
14,Reutilization of zeolite-sea salt catalyst,"3.7 Reutilization of zeolite-sea salt catalyst The results of the catalyst reusability are shown in Fig. 5 (b). According to Fig. 5(b), the removal rate of AMX was decreased after each step, reaching about 42% after the seventh step. The decrease in efficiency after each cycle can be due to the separation of active components of the catalyst from its body so that, the catalyst is no longer able to convert H2O2 into hydroxyl radical."
15,Radical scavengers,"3.8 Radical scavengers Based on the literature, methanol digests both hydroxyl and sulfide radicals but, isopropyl alcohol only traps hydroxyl radicals (Cano et al., 2020; Solís et al., 2020). According to Fig. 5(c), both radical consumers have reduced elimination yield by about 70%. Considering the results on the catalysts҆ characteristics, no sulfide groups were probably present in the reaction. In other words, hydroxyl radical was the only decomposing agent of AMX, which is in agreement with the amount of AMX adsorbed to the catalyst (reported to be 20%). In other words, only 20% of pollution removal does not occur due to radicals."
16,Pathway for AMX oxidation,"3.9 Pathway for AMX oxidation Two degradation pathways of AMX by the desired system are explained in Fig. 6 (a). Catalytic degradation of AMX using zeolite-sea salt and H2O2 as an oxidizer caused the production of OH● radicals promoting the reaction (Kanakaraju et al., 2015; Dou et al., 2020). The proposed structures and degradation paths due to loss of amine groups (Dou et al., 2020), ring-opening, oxidation of methyl groups (Dou et al., 2020), and separation of the bond between pentagonal and hexagonal rings (Dou et al., 2020) are shown in Fig. 6(b). Smaller parts in this figure have been also proven in the previous studies (Guo et al., 2015). In this study, two pathways are described regarding AMX degradation. The ion with an m/z ratio of 366 is correlated with the molecule of AMX. The ion with an m/z value of 310 is formed due to the epimerization process. For explicating about the ions with m/z values of 295 and 277 located near mineralization rate, these equations can be followed as: 295 (C16H21N3O6S + H+ –CO2 –NH3–CO2) → 277 (C16H21N3O6S + H+-CO2–NH3–CO2–H2O) (Dou et al., 2020). Furthermore, the ion with m/z value of 256 may change from the ion with m/z value of 277 due to methyl carboxylation (Dou et al., 2020). Then, the ion with m/z value of 256 is catalyzed by active oxygen in the shape of hydroxyl radicals and another mediocre (253 m/z) is produced. In the following, the ion with m/z value of 253 is degraded to the ion with m/z value of 218 with HO and COOH functional groups. Finally, the ion with m/z value of 218 easily forms the ion with m/z value of 206 without β-lactam ring (Bian et al., 2019). The second route begins with aliphatic combinations and small carboxyl groups that are gently formed, which are remarkably mineralized into CO2 and H2O (189 m/z) (Dou et al., 2020). At last, p-hydroxybenzoic acid (138 m/z) is a product of subsequent hydroxylation and dihydroxylation of the previous step as the primary amino group, followed by decarboxylation (elimination of CO2) reaction (Ganiyu et al., 2016)."
17,Conclusions,"The current study was done to produce a new catalyst from zeolite-sea salt for AMX removal in the presence of H2O2. During the generation of zeolite-sea salt, furnace temperature of 500 °C and time duration in the furnace of 4 h caused the maximum removal of AMX. Physicochemical properties of the optimized catalyst were also determined. The majority of AMX was removed by the zeolite-sea salt/H2O2 system under the optimum conditions (pH of 6.0, H2O2 concentration of 0.1 mL/100 mL, catalyst dosage of 7 g.L−1, AMX concentration of 50 mg/L, and contact time of 100 min). Radical scavengers reduced removal efficiency by about 70%. The AMX degradation through the developed system followed the first-order kinetics. The catalyst was recycled seven times and its efficiency was decreased after each time. Therefore, it can be concluded that zeolite-sea salt catalyst can be applied as an available and cost-effective catalyst for the elimination of AMX in many matrices."
