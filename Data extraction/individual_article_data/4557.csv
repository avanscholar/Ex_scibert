0,Introduction,"Nowadays many indispensable and fundamental reactions in organic synthesis, such as oxidations and reductions, are still performed using stoichiometric amounts of harmful inorganic reagents [1]. Safety hazards associated with these reagents and their by-products, and the difficulty to work-up the reaction mixtures are the major problems that make such widespread processes not environmentally friendly and not accepted in the concept of green chemistry. Consequently, there is tremendous demand for new processes that satisfy increasing environmental concerns and constraints. Thus, numerous catalytic methods using small amounts of metallic derivatives have been developed [2]. Unfortunately, most of these catalytic transformations are accomplished in costly and toxic organic solvents. Furthermore, in the homogeneous processes, the separation of the catalysts from the reaction products and their quantitative recovery in an active form are still the most important and difficult problems. Aqueous organometallic catalysis that has emerged as an active field of research in green chemistry is an excellent approach to overcome these drawbacks [3,4]. The use of water as solvent is important for economical, safety, and environmental reasons. The water-soluble catalyst which operates and resides in water is easily separated from the reaction products by simple decantation. In addition, the products are not contaminated with traces of metal catalyst, and the use of organic solvents, such as benzene and chlorinated hydrocarbons is circumvented. This review summarizes recent work from our group regarding the synthesis of various organic compounds based on the concept of aqueous-phase catalysis."
1,Results and discussion,
2,Oxidation reactions with tert-butyl hydroperoxide,"2.1 Oxidation reactions with tert-butyl hydroperoxide The oxidation of carbinol and methylene groups to the corresponding carbonyl moieties remains one of the most important reactions in organic synthesis [2]. Different transition-metal catalysts such as Cr, Co, Mn, Fe, Ru, Rh, Au, and Cu has been studied for such processes, particularly benzylic oxidations with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) [2,5–8]. The interest in TBHP resides in its relative stability during the oxidation reactions, its low price and its reduced form which can be recycled. Despite the economic and environmental benefits of copper-based catalysts compare to the other transition metals that are either toxic or very expensive, their use for oxidations is not abundant [9,10]. With all these metals, the vast majority of catalytic processes are, unfortunately, performed in costly and toxic organic solvents. Very few organic solvent-free processes have been reported for benzylic oxidation with TBHP [7,8]. However, these processes are based on high temperatures and are limited to very few substrates. We reported that the catalytic system composed of CuCl2·2H2O and 2,2′-biquinoline-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid dipotassium salt (BQC) is a highly effective catalyst for the oxidation of secondary benzylic, allylic, propargylic and 1-heteroaryl alcohols with TBHP in the presence of catalytic amount of tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBAC) [11,12]. The synthetic utility and limits of this catalytic system were illustrated by various alcohols. Secondary benzylic alcohols afforded selectively the corresponding ketones with full conversions. Allylic and propargylic alcohols underwent chemoselective oxidations leading to the corresponding unsaturated ketones with high yields, and no other products from epoxidation or rearrangement [13] reactions were detected. The catalytic system proved also to be able to catalyze the oxidation of unactivated alcohols, albeit in low yields (20–39%). Also, under the same conditions, the substitution of TBHP with greener oxidants, namely hydrogen peroxide (30% in water), sodium percarbonate or sodium perborate, gave no reaction. To get more insight into the catalytic activity of this oxidation method, the reaction was extended to 1-heteroaromatic-1-alkanols. 1-Heteroaromatic ketones are among the most important functionalized heterocycles that are essential precursors to a variety of biologically active compounds such as alkaloids. 1-Heteroaromatic ketones are frequently prepared by Friedel–Crafts acylation of heteroaromatic rings [14–17], condensation of metalated heterocycles with nitriles [18], and stoechiometric oxidations of 1-heteroaromatic-1-alkanols [19]. Although a plethora of catalytic methods have been developed for the oxidation of alcohols, the catalytic oxidations of 1-heteroaromatic-1-alkanols to the corresponding ketones are limited [20–22]. Our catalytic system was found to be highly efficient for the selective oxidation of secondary 1-heteroaromatic-1-alkanols to the corresponding heteroaromatic ketones, with aqueous t-butyl hydroperoxide at room temperature or 40°C (Scheme 1 ). It is compatible with various heterocycles groups such as 1, 2 or 4-pyridyls, 2-thienyl, 2-furyl, 2-pyrrolyl and indolyl. In the case of 2-pyridylcarbinols, where the nitrogen atom is very close to the hydroxyl groups, the reactions are sluggish and very poor results were obtained at room temperature and 40°C. Remarkably, the oxidation performed using higher catalyst/substrate ratio, and longer reaction time led to full conversion of the alcohols. The broad synthetic scope of this catalytic system was demonstrated in the synthesis of 2-ketopyrroles [14,15] and 2-ketoindoles [15–17,23] known for their biological properties, and for the synthesis of bis heteroaromatic ketones containing 2-thienyl moieties coupled with 2-pyridyl, 2-imidazolyl, or 2-thiazolyl group. These results indicate also the significant synthetic utility of our system since the oxidations of 2-pyrrolyl alcohols were performed with free (NH)-pyrroles, and there was no need to introduce protecting groups. We further extended CuCl2/BQC/TBHP to the oxidation of benzylic [24] and propargylic [25] methylene moieties. Alkylarenes were efficiently oxidized to the corresponding benzylic ketones in high yields (58–100%) at room temperature under solvent-free conditions. Benzylic tert-butylperoxy ethers (0–20%) and benzylic alcohols (0–12%) were observed and suggested as the reaction intermediates. In terms of efficiency, CuCl2/BQC system is comparable or superior to various catalytic systems described in the literature and which require the use of one or more of the following conditions: toxic organic solvent, high temperature, anhydrous TBHP, or catalyst that may be toxic, expensive or difficult to synthesize. α,β-Acetylenic ketones are essential precursors to a variety of biologically active compounds, such as C-nucleosides [26], anti-cancer agents [27] and pheromones [28]. These conjugated ynones are highly versatile building blocks for various organic compounds such as heterocycles [29]. α,β-Acetylenic ketones are frequently prepared by different methods including, acylation of alkynyl organometallic reagents [30], cross-coupling between terminal alkynes and acyl chlorides [31], carbonylation of terminal alkynes in the presence of aryl halides [32] and multistep synthesis [33]. α,β-Acetylenic ketones are also prepared by oxidation reactions of either propargylic alcohols or the corresponding alkynes. While the oxidation of propargylic alcohols using stoichiometric [34] or catalytic [35] processes is not frequent, direct oxidation technologies of alkynes to α,β-acetylenic ketones are scarce [36–42]. Stoichiometric and large excess amounts of chromium(VI) reagents have been used for α-oxidation of alkynes. However, low yields were obtained [36]. The first Cr(VI)-catalyzed α-oxidation of alkynes with tert-butyl hydroperoxide was reported, and only moderate yields were reached although large excess of TBHP used and long reaction time. In addition, the oxidation reactions were mostly performed in benzene [37]. SeO2/TBHP system was also used for the oxidation of propargylic methylenes [38]. The internal alkynes studied underwent α,α′-oxidation which led to a mixture of mono- and di-oxygenated acetylenic alcohols and ketones, with ynones as minor products [38]. A recent report showed that alkynes were converted by aerobic oxidation into α,β-acetylenic ketones with good yields using N-hydroxyphthalimide combined with a transition metal [39]. Aerobic oxidations of alkynes were also performed using hydroperoxides and metallic catalysts [40,41]. Nonheme iron complexes combined to hydrogen peroxide or TBHP led to poor yields and selectivities for α,β-acetylenic ketones [40], while better results were obtained with Cu(II)/TBHP system [41]. Finally iron phtalocyanines grafted onto silica were successfully used as catalysts for the oxidation of alkynes to ynones with excess TBHP [42]. To the best of our knowledge there were no reports previous to our work concerning selective α-oxidation of alkynes to α,β-acetylenic ketones in water. We, thus, disclosed an unprecedented highly efficient oxidation of alkynes to the corresponding ynones in water with aqueous tert-butyl hydroperoxide catalyzed by the system composed of CuCl2 and BQC [25]. To evaluate the synthetic potential of CuCl2/BQC system, various aromatic and aliphatic alkynes were subjected to the oxidation with four equivalents of TBHP under mild conditions (Scheme 2 ). Full conversions of alkynes were reached with excellent selectivities and propargylic tert-butylperoxy ethers were observed and suggested as the reaction intermediates. In the case of terminal alkynes the oxidations are sluggish and low yields ranging from 32 to 40% were obtained."
3,Hydrogen transfer oxidation and reduction,"2.2 Hydrogen transfer oxidation and reduction Oppenauer-type oxidation of secondary alcohols and Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley-type (MPV-type) reduction of ketones and aldehydes are elegant and highly selective processes that can be carried out under mild conditions, and are compatible with many functional groups such as carbon-carbon double and triple bonds, halogens, amino groups or sulfur atom-containing groups. Various transition-metal complexes have been studied as catalysts for Oppenauer-type oxidations [43,44] and MPV-type reductions [45]. Despite the obvious economical and ecological importance of aqueous-phase catalysis, few catalytic systems were reported for the hydrogen transfer reduction of aldehydes and ketones using as reducing agents sodium formate [46–48] and isopropanol. In this latter case, water-soluble aminosulfonamide complexes were reported as catalysts [49]. However, the transformation was limited to acetophenones, 1-indanone and 2-acetonaphtone, and no attempts have been made to recycle the catalysts. As part of our research program devoted to the synthesis of organic compounds in water, we were interested in developing an effective recyclable water-soluble catalyst for Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley-type reduction. We reported that the water-soluble rhodium complex generated in situ from [Rh(COD)Cl]2 and TPPTS has been found to be a quite effective catalyst for transfer hydrogenation of aldehydes and ketones with isopropanol, under basic conditions (Scheme 3 ) [50]. Various aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes and ketones were selectively converted to the corresponding alcohols, in good to excellent yields, indicating the wide synthetic scope of the catalytic system. It is important to note that [Rh(COD)Cl]2/TPPTS is a poor catalytic system for Oppenauer-type oxidation of secondary alcohols. We were pleased to discover that using iridium complex instead of rhodium one and BQC instead of TPPTS leaded to very active system. Thus we reported the first water-soluble system which catalyzes the oxidation of secondary alcohols with acetone (Scheme 3) [51,52]. [Ir(COD)Cl]2/BQC is highly efficient for the selective oxidation of benzylic, 1-heteroaromatic, aliphatic, and allylic secondary alcohols using catalyst/substrate ratios ranging from 0.4 to 2.5%. Sterically hindered allylic alcohols underwent selectively good conversions to the corresponding enones, while unhindered ones are completely isomerized to saturated ketones. The mercury tests indicated that the catalytic process is likely homogeneous. The mechanism proposed for this Oppenauer-type oxidation including the isomerization process is based on iridium-alkoxide species that would undergo β-hydride elimination of the coordinated alkoxide to produce the desired ketone and iridium hydride species. β-Hydride elimination from metal alkoxides have been observed [53] and proposed for hydrogen transfer reactions. In our case, the production of ortho-hydroxypropiophenone from 4-chromanol is in agreement with this suggestion. The comparison of the oxidation rates of PhCH(OH)CH3 and PhCD(OH)CH3, under the same conditions, indicates that the rate limiting step does not involve β-hydride elimination since the isotope effect is low, k H/k D =1.2."
4,Synthesis of amines and amides,"2.3 Synthesis of amines and amides Amines and their derivatives are widespread among natural products, and are highly versatile building blocks for various organic substrates and essential precursors to a variety of biologically active compounds such as pharmaceuticals [54,55]. Consequently, synthesis of amines is a very active field in medicinal chemistry and modern organic synthesis. The direct reductive amination (DRA) of aldehydes and ketones with amines to target higher alkylated amines is an elegant and a powerful methodology [56]. The two commonly used direct reductive amination processes are based on either hydride reducing agents or catalytic hydrogenation. Among the hydride reducing agents [57–60], different borohydrides are frequently used to carry out this transformation, mainly sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH3CN) [57] and sodium triacetoxyborohydride (NaBH(OAc)3) [58]. However, the processes based on such reducing agents have many limitations. Furthermore, they are not environmentally friendly and not accepted in the concept of green chemistry. In general it is necessary to use excess amount of amines in order to limit or prevent the competitive reduction of carbonyl groups. In addition, they frequently generate undesirable wasteful salts. NaBH3CN is expensive and highly toxic. Moreover, it may contaminate the product with cyanide [61] and generates toxic byproducts HCN and NaCN upon work-up. NaBH(OAc)3 is flammable, water-reactive, and poorly soluble in most of the commonly used organic solvents. Pyridine-BH3 [59] and tin hydride [60] are also used for the reductive amination of aldehydes and ketones. Pyridine-BH3 is unstable to heat and must be handled with extreme care [62], while tin hydride and its organotin byproducts are highly toxic [63]. Consequently, there is still tremendous demand for new processes that satisfy increasing environmental concerns and constraints. Direct reductive amination of carbonyl compounds were also performed by hydrogenation methods. In contrast to hydride reducing agents, the use of molecular hydrogen is attractive for economical and ecological viewpoints despite its incompatibility with some functional groups such as carbon-carbon double and triple bonds. While the literature abounds with heterogeneous hydrogenation processes [56], little attention has been paid to the direct reductive amination which are catalyzed by homogeneous catalysts [64,65]. DRA are mostly performed in costly and toxic organic solvents. Furthermore, anhydrous conditions were applied in order to avoid the decomposition of reducing agents or catalysts, and to enhance the generation of the intermediates imines or imminium ions. If direct reductive amination of carbonyl compounds could be performed in water, the processes would attract considerable interest. Thus, the challenging development of effective catalysts or reagents that tolerate water is highly desirable. Beller and co-workers reported the first DRA of aldehydes with ammonia using molecular hydrogen and water-soluble catalysts [64]. Excellent results were obtained, however organic solvents such as THF or methyl tert-butyl ether were used. Moreover, the reactions were performed at high temperature (135°C) and high hydrogen pressure (65bar). We recently reported an unprecedented highly efficient direct reductive amination of aldehydes with primary and secondary amines catalyzed by water soluble transition metal complexes under hydrogen pressure [66]. The catalysts are generated in situ using TPPTS or BQC. The best results were obtained with Pd(PhCN)2Cl2/BQC that allows full conversion of aldehydes and the formation of desired higher alkylated amines with excellent yields and selectivities (Scheme 4 ). Another important reaction we developed is water is the hydration of nitriles to the corresponding amides. Carboxamides can be prepared by the hydration of the corresponding nitriles in the presence of a strong base or a strong acid. However, the formation of carboxylic acids as side products is not easy to control. Consequently, several attempts have been made to develop catalytic methods which can give the desired amides selectively, and only few water-soluble catalysts have been reported for this transformation [67–70]. While the water-soluble catalysts Pd(OH)(bipy)(H2O) [67] and IrH(CO)(TPPTS)3 [68] gave low activities and no attempts have been made to recycle the catalysts, K2CO3 assisted by microwave irradiation [69] and Ruthenium immobilized over chitosan [70] acted as efficient recyclable catalysts. Our system composed of [Rh(COD)Cl]2/TPPTS has been found to be a very effective catalyst for the hydration of nitriles, under basic conditions [71]. A number of aliphatic and aromatic nitriles were successfully converted to the corresponding amides in good yields (Table 1 )."
5,Enhancement of reaction rates and recycling of the catalysts,"2.4 Enhancement of reaction rates and recycling of the catalysts In aqueous-phase organometallic catalysis, the water-immiscibility of organic reactants allows an easy recovery of the catalysts by simple decantation. However, it tends to decrease reaction rates since reactants and catalysts reside in two different phases. Thus it is important to develop experimental concepts that permit good yields in reasonable reaction time, and separation of the products from the aqueous phase containing the catalyst without its leaching to the organic phase. In order to increase the reaction rates, several methods have been suggested such as addition of surfactants, co-solvents and tenside ligands [11,72]. In the case of oxidation reactions with tert-butyl hydroperoxide catalyzed by CuCl2/BQC, it is necessary to add sodium carbonate to the reaction mixture (catalytic amounts are sufficient) since its absence is prejudicial to the processes leading to low conversions [11,24]. The role of Na2CO3 is to keep the system CuCl2/BQC in its water-soluble active form. We demonstrated also that the addition of co-solvents such as methanol or acetonitrile, phase-transfer catalysts such as cyclodextrins or ammonium salts, enhance reaction rates, and the best results were obtained with tetrabutylammonium chloride [11]. In the case of hydrogen transfer reactions, acetone (Oppenauer-type oxidation) [51,52] and isopropanol (Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley-type reduction) [50] are used in excess not only as reagents, but also as co-solvents that significantly improve the efficiencies of both processes, under our conditions. Since we aimed the quantitative recovery and recycling of the catalysts, it is important to select judiciously a proper solvent for the extraction of the products without leaching of the catalysts to the organic phases [72]. For oxidation reactions with TBHP catalyzed by CuCl2/BQC, examination of different solvents, under the oxidation conditions showed that TBHP and TBAC allowed the leaching of the catalyst from the aqueous phase to the organic one in the case of CH2Cl2, ClCH2CH2Cl and PhCN. However, other solvents, namely ethyl acetate, toluene and diethylether, allow the extraction of the products without leaching of the catalyst. Using then ethyl acetate as the solvent for the extraction procedure, we demonstrated the stability and recyclability of the catalytic system CuCl2/BQC, which gave excellent conversions up to six cycles, by adding for each cycle a fresh charge of the substrate, TBHP and TBAC [11,25]. Based on the same strategy, we developed also excellent procedures for the recovery and recycling of the catalysts for hydrogen transfer reactions [50–52] and reductive amination of aldehydes [66]. We studied also the catalyst recycling for the hydration of acetonitrile catalyzed by [Rh(COD)Cl]2/TPPTS [71]. Five consecutive cycles were performed and a decrease in activity was observed after each of the five recycling experiments. This decrease in activity was attributed mainly to the leaching of the catalyst which is very soluble in acetamide organic solutions [71]. In summary, for all the reactions that we studied based on catalysis in water, we developed wisely the experimental conditions which allowed achieving excellent results. Thus, our catalytic systems are not only recyclable but also more performing than many catalytic systems studied in organic solvents."
6,Conclusion,"With regard to economic and environmental issues, it is important to develop organic reactions which respect the concept of green chemistry. For the last fourteen years, we succeeded to synthesize a wide variety of organic compounds using water-soluble catalysts that are cheap and environmentally friendly. Many of these catalytic systems can be recycled with no significant loss of activity. We disclosed unprecedented procedures including: (i) selective oxidation with TBHP of alcohols, alkylarenes and alkynes catalyzed by water-soluble CuCl2/BQC system; the oxidation of alkynes to α,β-Acetylenic ketones and synthesis of heteroaromatic ketones are particularly interesting since such oxidations are scarce; (ii) Oppenauer-type oxidation of secondary alcohols and Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley-type reduction of ketones and aldehydes based respectively on [Ir(COD)Cl]2/BQC and [Rh(COD)Cl]2/TPPTS; (iii) direct reductive amination of aldehydes with primary and secondary amines catalyzed by water soluble Pd(PhCN)2Cl2/BQC system, and finally (iv) hydration of nitriles to the corresponding amides catalyzed by [Rh(COD)Cl]2/TPPTS."
