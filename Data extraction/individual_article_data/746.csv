0,Introduction,"Aromatic amines are widely used as intermediates for the production of polymers, pigments, pesticides, dyes, and pharmaceuticals [1,2]. In practice, aromatic amines are produced mainly by the reduction of respective aromatic nitro compounds which are usually readily available. Metals (Zn, Sn, Fe) in the presence of acids can be used as the reducing agents [1]. The methods of catalytic hydrogenation [3–5], including those using supercritical co-solvent CO2 [6] are applied. In recent years, considerable attention has been focusing on the reduction of nitroarenes to amines with the use of catalytic hydrogen transfer systems including alcohols, hydrazine hydrate, triethylammonium formate, etc. as the hydrogen donors [7]. The catalysts are Ru/C [8], Au/TiO2 [9,10], Au/C [11], Cu–MgO–Al2O3 [12], KOH–NiO–Al2O3 [13], KOH–ZrO2–NiO [14], etc. As shown in our recent studies of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde 1 and 4-nitroacetophenone 2 reduction in a flow reactor in sc-CO2/isopropanol solvent in the presence of Al2O3 [15,16], the reduction of carbonyl groups is accompanied by partial reduction of nitro-groups to amine-groups (Scheme 1 ). In these reactions, isopropanol acts both as solvent and hydrogen donor and converts to acetone (contact time≤6min). The use of this simple and readily up-scalable catalytic system for the reduction of nitroarenes to amines seems quite promising although the selectivity to aminoarenes in [15,16] was low. The present work is focused on the development of efficient method for selective production of aminoarenes from nitrocompounds in a flow reactor using reducing system alcohol/alumina."
1,Experimental,"Commercially available nitroarenes and 4-methylpentan-2-one 14 (see Scheme 5), Aldrich were used as received without purification. N-Isopropylaniline 7 (see Scheme 2 ) was synthesized in accordance with article [17]. The supplied isopropyl alcohol and methanol contained no less than 99.8wt.% of the main substance and no more than 0.05wt.% of water. CO2 was a stated purity of 99.9vol.% and contained no more than 0.02vol.% water. The reactor was loaded with γ-Al2O3 (Macherey-Nagel, pH 7±0.5, free BET surface area ∼130m2/g) of 50–200μm particle size without pretreatment. Experimental studies were performed in the laboratory-scale set-up described earlier [18,19], using a tubular flow-type reactor (6.0mm×0.8mm, length 3.0m) loaded with 42cm3 (39.1g) of alumina. The initial mixture was fed to the reactor as two streams. The first stream – 1% substrate solution in alcohol – was fed at a rate of 3ml/min to a mixer at the reactor inlet. The second stream was supplied into the same mixer by a syringe pump through a heat exchanger where it was preheated to the reaction temperature. The second stream rate was varied depending on the solvent in order to provide almost the same reagent concentration in all experiments. In case of CO2 the rate was 5ml/min; the rates of isopropanol and methanol were 7 and 4ml/min, respectively. The residence time (τ) was determined as the ratio between the catalyst volume in the reactor V c (cm3) and the total inlet rate of the mixture Q (cm3/s). Depending on the second stream rate, the residence time varied from 4.2 to 6.0min. The reactions were performed in the temperature interval of 545–615K at pressure P ≈20MPa. To determine critical parameters of the studied systems and experimental conditions (temperature and pressure) providing single-phase supercritical state of the reaction mixture, thermodynamic calculations and phase diagram plotting were made using RKS EOS [20]. Table 1 presents the calculated critical temperatures and pressures for the selected mixtures in comparison with respective values for CO2 and i-PrOH. The reaction products were cooled at the reactor outlet and analyzed. Gassing in the reaction products was not observed. Composition of the reaction products in the liquid phase was determined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) using an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer Agilent 5975C as a detector. Quartz column HP-5MS (copolymer 5%-diphenyl–95%-dimethylsiloxane) of length 30m, internal diameter 0.25mm and stationary phase film thickness 0.25μm was used for the analysis. The standard deviation for chromatographic analysis is not more than 3%. Qualitative analysis was performed by comparing retention indices of components and their complete mass spectra with the corresponding data for pure compounds if any and with the data of the NIST library, the Wiley7 library of mass-spectrometric data. The percentage composition of mixtures was calculated from the surface areas of chromatographic peaks using no correction coefficients. 1H and 13C NMR spectra: Bruker DRX-500 apparatus at 500.13MHz (1H) and 125.76MHz (13C) in CDCl3; chemical shifts δ in ppm rel. to residual CHCl3 [δ(H) 7.24, δ(C) 76.90ppm], J in Hz. The structure of the products was determined by analyzing the 1H and 13C NMR spectra, 1H,1H double-resonance spectra and 13C,1H-type 2D-COSY (J(C,H)=160Hz). HR-MS: DFS Thermo Scientific spectrometer in a full scan mode (15–500 m/z, 70eV electron impact ionization, direct sample administration)."
2,Synthesis of 4-methylpentane-2-ol 18 (see Scheme 6),"2.1 Synthesis of 4-methylpentane-2-ol 18 (see Scheme 6) 4-Methylpentan-2-one 14 (120ml, 96g) was dropped under stirring and cooling to 0°C into a solution of 28.9g LiAlH4 in 400ml of dry Et2O. After stirring the mixture for 3h at 0°C, 200ml H2O was added. The sediment was filtered and washed with Et2O. This mixture was washed 3 times with 100ml of brine and dried with MgSO4. After filtering the drying agent and solvent evaporating, 81.0g (83%) of 4-methylpentan-2-ol 18 was obtained. The 1H NMR-spectrum of the synthesized 4-methylpentan-2-ol 18 coincided with respective spectrum reported in literature [21]."
3,Identification of compounds 8 and 9,"2.2 Identification of compounds 8 and 9 The reaction mixture resulted from the reduction of nitrobenzene in isopropanol at 615K (Scheme 2 and Table 2 ), was distilled. A part of the obtained fraction (0.021) was separated in NEt3-deactivated SiO2 column using hexane with ethyl acetate gradient from 0 to 100% as the eluent containing 1% NEt3. As a result, 0.007g of 2-isopropoxy-N-isopropylaniline 8 was obtained. The rest (0.067g) was separated in NEt3-deactivated Al2O3 column using hexane with methylene chloride gradient from 0 to 100% as the eluent containing 1% NEt3. As a result, 0.012g of 2-isopropoxy-N-isopropylaniline 8 and 0.006g of 4-isopropoxy-N-isopropylaniline 9 were obtained. The NMR spectra of the compounds are in the Supplemental Material."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Reduction of nitrobenzene 3,"3.1 Reduction of nitrobenzene 3 In experiments on selective reduction of nitroarenes into amines in a flow reactor in the presence of alumina, nitrobenzene 3 was used as the first substrate. At the first step, a system containing supercritical solvent CO2/isopropanol was used, in which we observed the reduction of nitro-groups in compounds 1 and 2 in our previous works [15,16]. At 515K, the conversion of nitrobenzene 3 did not exceed 1%. Aniline 4 was the only detected product (Scheme 2 and Fig. 1 ). As the temperature increased to 545K, the conversion increased to 7% and, besides aniline 4, its methylated derivative (N-methylaniline 5) was detected. Note that the possibility of compound 5 formation from aniline 4 and CO2 was shown in recent paper [22] in experiments with the use of catalytic system N-heterocyclic carbenes/ZnCl2 and reducing agent PhSiH3. In our work, the reaction proceeds in the presence of ordinary Al2O3 with isopropanol as the reducing agent. The authors of [22] suggest the reaction proceeds through the formation of intermediate N-phenylformamide 6. However, in our experiments compound 6 was not detected, most likely, due to high rate of aldehyde reduction in the used system [15,23]. At 580K, the nitrobenzene 3 conversion reached almost 100%; the selectivity to aniline 4 was 66%. The reaction by-products were compounds 5 and 7, and 2-isopropoxy- and 4-isopropoxy-N-isopropylanilines 8 and 9 (1:1.3). Besides, N-isopropylideneaniline 10 and 4-isopropoxyaniline 12 were detected in the reaction mixture. Probably, imine 10 and compound 12 are intermediates in the formation of compounds 7 and 9, respectively. As the temperature raised to 600K, the content of N-isopropylaniline 7 and compounds 8 and 9 increased. And, finally, at 615K the content of compounds 8 and 9 decreased, the selectivity to aniline 4 slightly increased. To clarify the effect of CO2 on the reduction of nitrobenzene 3, we performed experiments with compound 3 in neat supercritical isopropanol. Table 2 presents the results obtained. Expectedly, the reaction products contain no N-methylamine 5 that proves the suggested route of its formation involving CO2. In experiment at 545K, the selectivity to aniline 4 was 70% at nitrobenzene 3 conversion of 35%. Noteworthy, the reaction mixture contained large amount of alkoxy-compounds 8, 9, 11, 12 (total content 26%) and insignificant quantity of N-isopropylaniline 7. As the temperature increased to 615K, the selectivity to aniline 4 decreased; total content of compounds 8, 9, 11, 12 increased attaining 39%. Among them, compounds 8 and 9 containing primary amino-groups were the main products. In contrast to nitrobenzene 3 reduction in the presence of CO2, in these experiments, increasing temperature caused insignificant increase in the content of compound 7. Compounds 8 and 9 have not been previously described in the literature. To determine their structure, we performed preparative separation of the reaction mixture obtained at 615K on deactivated SiO2 and isolated compound 8. Compound 9 seems to be unstable under these separation conditions. We were able to isolate it only in NEt3-deactivated Al2O3 column. Scheme 3 presents probable route for the formation of compounds 8, 9, 11, 12. It may proceed through the formation of N-phenylhydroxylamine 13 which transforms to iminium cations capable to react with isopropanol to produce compounds 11 and 12. Subsequent N-alkylation of amines 11 and 12 may yield compounds 8 and 9. Similar transformations at catalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene 3 in the presence of strong mineral acids, yielding 4-aminophenol (Bamberger rearrangement) have been reported in literature [24,25]. Iminium cations are supposed to be the key intermediates in this reaction [26,27]. The suggested scheme for the formation of compounds 8, 9, 11 and 12 is proved also by the fact that in experiments on the reduction in individual isopropanol of aniline 4 which is unable to transform to iminium cations under the used experimental conditions, no alkoxylation products were detected at temperatures 590 and 615K. The only product of aniline transformations at 615K was N-isopropylaniline 7 (Scheme 4 ) detected in the amount of 8%. Transformations of compound 7 under the same conditions also yielded no alkoxylation products 8 and 9. At 615K, insignificant (∼1%) decomposition of compound 7 to aniline 4 was observed. Thus, the use of supercritical co-solvent CO2 produces significant effect on the course of both nitrobenzene 3 reduction to aniline 4 and secondary/side reactions. In the presence of CO2, significant amount of N-alkylated compound 7 was formed; without CO2, the products of aromatic ring alkoxylation – compounds 11 and 12, and 8 and 9 were formed. One of the possible explanations of the role of CO2 may include the increasing in acidity of supercritical fluid in the presence of CO2 which affects the reactions ways. Formation of N-isopropylaniline 7 from aniline 4 may proceed by two ways, namely, direct alkylation by isopropanol, or through intermediate formation of imine 10 and its subsequent reduction (Scheme 2). The first route is proved by the formation of compound 7 in experiments with aniline 4 without acetone (Scheme 4), the second one – by the presence of compound 10 in the reaction mixture at the reduction of nitrobenzene 3 (Scheme 2). To check the feasibility of the route proceeding through imine 10 formation and subsequent reduction, we added 10% of acetone (molar ratio nitrobenzene 3:acetone=1:17) to complex supercritical solvent CO2/isopropanol. Since the reduction of one nitrobenzene 3 molecule yields three acetone equivalents, the adding of 17 acetone equivalents facilitates strong acetone excess that may shift the system toward high content of compound 7 in the reaction mixture. Since the reaction was performed at high temperatures (595 and 615K), the nitrobenzene 3 conversion was complete in all experiments (Table 3 ). The content of compound 7 in the reaction mixtures indeed increased, although not as much as would be expected assuming its production by exclusively imine-mediated route. This means most likely that both routes of N-isopropylaniline 7 production from aniline 4, by direct alkylation with isopropanol or through intermediate formation of imine 10, proceed simultaneously (Scheme 2). When acetone was replaced by sterically hindered ketone (4-methylpentan-2-one 14), only insignificant amount of compound 15 (Scheme 5 ) was observed in the reaction mixture. Most likely, it was a product of reduction of intermediate imine 16, which, however, was not detected. Again, compound 7 appeared as the main secondary product, although in smaller quantities than in the experiment with the addition of acetone. The observed significant effect of complex supercritical solvent on the reaction mechanism and selectivity induced the need for a separate study of an alcohol solvent component. First, we replaced isopropanol by methanol in the supercritical complex CO2-containing solvent. Since the reactions of aniline 4 with both methanol and CO2 produced the same secondary product (N-methylaniline 5), the reaction mixture became less complex (Table 4 ). The conversion at 515 and 545K was low, only compounds 4 and 5 were detected in the reaction mixture. As the temperature increased to 580K, the conversion attained 100%; N,N-dimethylaniline 17 was one of the main products. At 615K, compound 17 became the main product with a content of 68%. Note that N,N-dimethylaniline 17 is the key intermediate in industrial synthesis of triarylmethane dyes [28]. At 580K, reduction of nitrobenzene 3 in individual methanol showed lower conversion than the reaction in the presence of CO2. The content of alkylated products 5 and 17 was lower as well, in agreement with the regularities observed in our earlier studies of the reactions in isopropanol. At 615K, the product distributions in the reactions with and without CO2 were similar. Note that the formation of alkoxylated products was observed only at 615K; their content did not exceed 3% independently of CO2 presence. When sterically hindered solvent/reagent 4-methylpentan-2-ol 18 was used instead of methanol or isopropanol in a mixture with CO2 at 575K, the selectivity to aniline 4 increased considerably and reached 95% at conversion of 71%. Only one secondary product 4-(4-methylpentan-2-yloxy)aniline 19 was observed (Scheme 6 and Table 4). Similarly to experiments with isopropanol, CO2 was used in this case for lowering the critical temperature and reducing the contribution of alkoxylation reactions. As the temperature was increased to 595K, the conversion reached 100%, but selectivity to aniline 4 decreased to 75%. Thus, depending of the alcohol, the reaction of nitrobenzene 3 reduction may yield either aniline 4, or alkylated amines as the main products."
6,Reduction halogen-substituted nitrobenzenes,"3.2 Reduction halogen-substituted nitrobenzenes Halogenated aromatic amines are widely used as intermediates in the production of polymers, pigments, pesticides, dyes, pharmaceuticals [29]. At the same time the reduction of halogenated nitrobenzenes is often impeded by partial dehalogenation that imposes additional requirements to the used catalytic systems [29,30]. In this regard, development of efficient methods for their synthesis is an important task [31,32]. In the present work, the studies on the reduction of o- and p-halogen-substituted nitrobenzenes 20–23 were performed using the same conditions as those in the studies of compound 3 reduction. Transformation of 4-chloronitrobenzene 20 in scCO2/iPrOH at 545K showed the selectivity to 4-chloroaniline 24 of 78% and conversion of 75%; 4-chloro-N-isopropylaniline 28 and 4-chloro-N-methylaniline 32 (Scheme 7 and Table 5 ) were the byproducts. At 575K the conversion attained 100%, the content of alkylated products 28 and 32 increased. As the temperature was elevated to 615K, the content of 4-chloroaniline 24 decreased to 32%, the content of non-chlorinated products 4, 7 and 4-isopropylaniline 34 (Fig. 2 ) increased. Based on these data, further experiments were performed at temperatures 545 and 575K. Conversion of 2-chloronitrobenzene 21 under the same conditions was slightly lower compared to that of isomer 20, whereas the selectivity to target product 2-chloroaniline 25 appeared high and reached 90–92% depending on the temperature. In case of 4- and 2-bromonitrobenzenes 22 and 23, the selectivity to amines 26 and 27 reached 83%. Compared to the respective transformations of chloronitrobenzenes 20 and 21, the contribution of dehalogenation processes yielding compounds 3, 4 and 7 increased, especially in the case of 2-bromonitrobenzene 23. 2,4-Dibromoaniline 35, resulting obviously from bromination of 4- and 2-bromoanilines 26 and 27, was detected in the reaction mixture. In experiments with 4-bromonitrobenzene 22, similarly to its chlorinated analog 20, the reaction mixture contained significant amounts of N-alkylated products 30 and 33, whereas the o-substituted compounds 21 and 23 were not alkylated. When individual isopropanol was used as the supercritical solvent in the experiments with halogen-substituted nitrobenzenes, the contribution of amino-group alkylation reactions decreased considerably (Table 6 ) – the same effect was observed in experiments on nitrobenzene 3 reduction. In contrast to transformations of nitrobenzene 3, the reduction of halogen-substituted nitrobenzenes 20–23 yielded no alkoxylation products. Reduction of 4-chloronitrobenzene 20 proceeds with high conversion even at 545K and shows almost 100% selectivity to 4-chloroaniline 24. At 575K the conversion attains 100%, but the selectivity slightly decreases due to side reactions of hydrodechlorination and alkylation of the amine-group in compound 24, yielding 4-chloro-N-isopropylaniline 28. Formation of 2-chloroaniline 25 from compound 21 proceeded with high selectivity of ∼98% at both 545 and 575K; conversion at the latter temperature was 100%. Reduction of 4-bromonitrobenzene 22 showed a 73% conversion at 545K; the selectivity to the main product 4-bromoaniline 26 was ca. 98%. As the temperature increased to 575K, the conversion reached 100%, the selectivity slightly decreased (90%) due to side reactions of hydrodebromination and N-alkylation in compound 26, yielding compound 30. In experiments with 2-bromonitrobenzene 23, the selectivity to target product 2-bromoaniline 27 was 82 to 86%; hydrodebromination was the only side reaction leading to the formation of nitrobenzene 3 at 545K or aniline 4 at 575K."
7,Conclusions,"For the first time, the reduction of nitroarenes using supercritical alcohols as a source of hydrogen was studied in a flow reactor in the presence of alumina. The reactions were performed in the temperature range of 515–615K at contact times not exceeding 6min. In experiments on nitrobenzene 3 reduction, the maximum selectivity to aniline 4 (up to 95%) and high conversion was reached in a mixture of sterically hindered alcohol 4-methylpentan-2-ol 18 and CO2. The reaction in methanol yielded N,N-dimethylaniline 17 as the main product. The reduction in isopropanol was complicated by alkylation of amine group in aniline 4 leading to compound 7 and competitive reaction of aromatic ring alkoxylation. The use of scCO2 as a co-solvent had a significant effect on the progress of both nitrobenzene 3 reduction to aniline 4 and secondary/side reactions. Indeed, in the presence of CO2, significant amount of N-alkylated derivative 7 was formed, without CO2 the products of aromatic ring alkoxylation (compounds 8, 9 and 11, 12) were detected in the reaction mixture. Besides, the formation of N-methylaniline 5 from aniline 4 and CO2 under the used reaction conditions was observed. It was reasonably suggested that N-isopropylaniline 7 could be formed by competitive routes: direct alkylation of the amine group nitrogen by isopropanol, and through intermediate formation of imine 10 followed by its reduction. The conditions were found for the reduction of chloro- and bromo-substituted nitrobenzenes to respective amines with high conversion and almost 100% selectivity. Significant contribution of hydrodehalogenation processes was proved to occur only at high temperatures."
