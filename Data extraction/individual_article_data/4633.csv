0,Introduction,"Rapid development of the economy has improved significantly the quality of people's lives. However, environmental and energy problems have become increasingly prominent, and their impact on people's normal lives has been gradually intensified [1]. Especially, the energy issue is attracting more and more attention from people all over the world, so how to effectively solve the problem of energy is extremely urgent [2]. In order to solve the above energy crisis, people urgently look for alternative ways to develop renewable energy. At present, scientists are researching and developing alternative energy sources such as biological energy [3], geothermal energy [4], solar energy [5], wind energy [6], nuclear energy [7]and so on [8]. Furthermore, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, solar cell, phase-change materials [9] and rechargeable metal air batteries and other technologies also have an attractive application prospect in energy field [10]. Among them, photocatalysis technology is treated as a prospective and effective mean to solve environmental and energy problems due to its simple operation, low cost and no secondary pollution and so on. High-efficient photocatalyst can not only effectively catalyze the purification of wastewater [11], but also can effectively catalyze hydrogen production by water splitting under solar illumination [12]. However, the majority of traditional photocatalysts (such as TiO2, bismuth-based compounds, etc.) generally possess wide band gap and high combination frequency of light-activated carriers, resulting in weak visible-light-driven (VLD) catalytic activity of such photocatalyst materials [13]. Therefore, the development of new VLD photocatalysts currently have become the main research topic of many researchers in material chemistry and catalysis field [14]. To improve the VLD hydrogen production performance of traditional photocatalysts and enable them to make efficient use of solar energy, a large number of composite photocatalysts with superior performance have been synthesized through a variety of different modification methods, such as heterostructure building [15], metal/non-metal doping [16], crystal shape regulation [17], surface modification [18], plasma generation [19] and introduction of special performance materials [20]. For instance, Sun et al. [21] designed an anatase-TiO2 (B) biphase nanowire/ZnO nanoparticle, Han et al. [22] synthesized a Ni-Mo/g-C3N4 nanoparticle, and Chen et al. [23] reported a lanthanum modified Ni/sepiolite catalyst to reforming of tar model compounds. Research shows that these measures can enhance the light response of photocatalysts, promote the fast conduction of photo-induced carriers at interfaces of different components, so as to effectively reduce the combination frequency of photoexcited carriers and endow the photocatalysts with superior VLD catalytic activity. In recent years, in view of the high specific surface area, good adsorption performance, good chemical stability, high electron conductivity, non-toxicity and easy preparation of two-dimensional graphite phase carbon-nitrogen compounds (2D g-C3N4), a large number of studies have concentrated on the application of 2D g-C3N4 in photocatalyst synthesis [24]. Compared with traditional photocatalysts, 2D g-C3N4, a new non-metallic photocatalyst material, presents a wider light absorption range for its small band gap (~2.7 eV) [25]. Researches show that g-C3N4 can effectively activate molecular oxygen to generate superoxide radicals, thus effectively catalyzing the degradation of organic pollutants in wastewater [26]. When combined with some co-catalyst for hydrogen evolution, the unique 2D structure of g-C3N4 can possess superior light absorption, also presents fast interfacial charge conduction characteristics, which promotes the effective separation of photo-excited carriers and high-efficiently facilitates the reduction of water molecules to evolve hydrogen [27]. Such as Zhu et al. [28] reported a g-C3N4/Fe3O4 photocatalys, Shen et al. [29] designed a g-C3N4/Cu3P composite, Patnaik et al. [30] synthesized a Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 composite, and Zhuang et al. [31] prepared a MoB/g-C3N4 Schottky catalyst. Silver halide (AgX, X = Cl, Br, I), a kind of good photosensitive material, was widely used to improve the catalytic performance of traditional photocatalyst via many scientific researchers in recent years, such as C-CoFe/Ag-AgX (X = Cl, Br and I) [32], Ag@AgI/BiOI [33], Ag@AgCl/ZnO [34], Ag/AgX/rGO (X = Cl or Br) [35], Ag@AgX nanowires [36] and so on. For the introduction of AgX co-catalyst, especially when the small size AgX NPs are well dispersed in different semiconductor photocatalyst, a typical composite heterostructure will be formed, which will improve the photo-response ability and speed up the interfacial charge migration ability, so as to effectively reduce the combination frequency of photo-induced carriers and ultimately significantly enhance the VLD catalytic properties of photocatalyst. To improve the VLD catalytic hydrogen production activity of 2D g-C3N4, the superior photosensitive AgBr co-catalyst was imported to 2D g-C3N4 structure via solvothermal technology, and the CNAA-α (α = 1, 2, 3) composite heterostructures with different AgBr incorporation were prepared. Although the similar structures had been reported by other researchers [37], all their applications were focused on the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants, also the sufficient evidence for the formation of heterstructure was not supplied. In this research, the morphologies, compositions and photoelectrochemical characteristics were analyzed by a variety of characterization technologies. Meanwhile, the VLD catalytic activities of CNAA-α heterostructures were measured by the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Compared with pristine 2D g-C3N4 structure, the CNAA-α presented significantly enhanced VLD catalytic activity at absence of Pt co-catalyst, especially the CNAA-2 exhibited the highest activity (47.84 μmol·g−1·h−1). Also, the formation of g-C3N4-AgBr p-n heterointerfaces and generation of Ag plasmas were also demonstrated by the XRD, XPS and Mott-Schottky (M-S) measurements, and the corresponding catalytic mechanism of CNAA-2 heterostructure was explored based on the research results."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Melamine (C3H6N6), ethylene glycol (EG), silver nitrate (AgNO3), potassium bromide (KBr), ethyl alcohol (EA), potassium ferricyanide (K3[Fe(CN)6]), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) and triethanolamine (TEOA) were obtained from Aladdin Chemical, and all them were analytical reagents and were used directly without any processing."
3,"Synthesis of g-C3N4 and CNAA-α (α = 1, 2, 3) heterostructures","2.2 Synthesis of g-C3N4 and CNAA-α (α = 1, 2, 3) heterostructures The synthesis method of g-C3N4 is as follows: A ceramic crucible containing 10 g C3H6N6 was placed in a muffle furnace and kept for 4 h at 550 °C (10 °C/min), then the pale yellow powder (g-C3N4) was obtained (as Fig. 1 ). The CNAA-α (α = 1, 2, 3) heterostructures were constructed by solvothermal method. 100 mg g-C3N4 was dispersed in 80 mL EG with ultrasonically stirring for 30 min. Then, stoichiometric AgNO3 (0.01 wt%, 0.02 wt% and 0.03 wt% to the amount of g-C3N4) was added to above mixture, and a slight excess KBr was added after ultrasonic stirring for half an hour. When the uniform mixture was formed, it was transferred to an autoclave with capacity of 100 mL, then the autoclave was kept for 10 h at 180 °C (as Fig. 1). Here, CNAA-α (α = 1, 2 and 3) was used to express the final products, and “α” expressed the introducing amount of AgNO3 (0.01 wt%, 0.02 wt% and 0.03 wt%)."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on German AXS D8 QUEST. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was taken on the Germany AXS Vertex70. Laser confocal Raman spectrometer was recorded on American THEM. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas were calculated from the multipoint BET method on a N2 adsorption/desorption analyzer (ASAP2460, USA). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was operated on Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN with corresponding energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS SUPRA made in British) was used to investigate the type and valence of elements. UV–vis diffuse reflection spectra (UV–vis DRS, Lambda 25 of Perkinelmer) was performed to analyze the light response of the samples. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured by FS5 fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh, UK) with Xenon 150 W lamp as steady light source."
5,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements In this experiment, all electrochemical measurements were performed on a PARSTAT 4000 electrochemical workstation by the three electrode systems in the quartz electrolyzer. ITO glass (15 mm × 15 mm × 1.5 mm) coated with sample, platinum electrode and Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. 300 W xenon lamp was used as the light source for photocurrent testing. The detailed operation was performed according to our previous study [38]."
6,Test of hydrogen evolution,"2.5 Test of hydrogen evolution The on-line photocatalytic analysis system of LabSolar-IIIAG was used to generate H2. In the closed glass circulation system, Xenon lamp (PLSSXE300) was used as light source and gas chromatograph (GC 7900, TCD) was used to detect the content of generated hydrogen. In detail, 30 mg catalyst was ultrasonically dispersed in 50 mL deionized water containing 15 wt% TEOA, then the dispersion was transferred to the photo-reaction vessel and was stirred continuously. The entire system was kept vacuum state, and the reaction solution was illuminated with a xenon lamp. The H2 was detected by gas chromatography at the interval of 1 h, and the process lasted for 6 h by continuously monitoring the amount of generated H2."
7,Results and discussion,
8,"Morphology, composition and structure","3.1 Morphology, composition and structure XRD was performed to study the crystal structure and composition of the samples, and the corresponding XRD patterns of pristine g-C3N4, AgBr and CNAA-α are shown in Fig. 2a. A characteristic peak (27.2°) of pure g-C3N4 corresponds to the (002) crystal plane, which attributes to the interlayer deposition of conjugated aromatic hydrocarbons [39]. This peak can also be observed in other three composite catalysts, indicating that it does not change the crystal structure of 2D g-C3N4 by composting with Ag/AgBr NPs. Furthermore, the diffraction peaks of (200), (220), (222), (400), (420) and (422) plane of AgBr (JCPDS 06-0438) [40] can be observed at 30.9°, 44.3°, 55.0°, 64.5°, 73.3° and 81.6°, indicating that the AgBr component exists in the 2D g-C3N4 structure. Beyond that, a new diffraction peak appears at 38.1° in all CNAA-α samples, which corresponds to the (111) plane of Ag (JCPDS 04-0783) [41]. It indicates that metallic silver is generated during the synthetic process of CNAA-α. Obviously, as the increase of Ag/AgBr content, the diffraction peak intensity of Ag (JCPDS 04-0783) and AgBr (JCPDS 06-0438) present more distinct and strong, indicating that the CNAA-α composites are successfully synthesized. The FTIR spectra in Fig. 2b displays the comparisons of g-C3N4 and CNAA-2. Five characteristic peaks can be observed at the wavelength of 1245, 1326, 1413, 1563 and 1633 cm−1, which attributes to the stretching vibration of CN bond and CN bond in heterocyclic g-C3N4 compounds [42]. The sharp characteristic peak at 809 cm−1 assigns to the vibration of triazine unit [43], and this absorption peak can also be observed in the spectrum of CNAA-2. Furthermore, the characteristic peak corresponding to -NH2 at 3500–3300 cm−1 is significantly weakened in the spectrum of CNAA-2, which is because that the -NH2 groups in g-C3N4 structure can be used as excellent ligands to complex with Ag+ ions, and this plays an important guiding role for in situ generation of Ag/AgBr NPs. Compared with g-C3N4, the absorption strength at 1579 cm−1 greatly reduces, which is caused by the construction of g-C3N4-Ag/AgBr nanostructures. Furthermore, the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms in Fig. 2c show that both g-C3N4 and CNAA-2 possess H3 type hysteretic loop, which indicates that the porous structures are originated from the stacking of lamellar structures. The BET surface areas of g-C3N4 and CNAA-2 can be confirmed to be 69.71 m2/g and 17.16 m2/g, respectively. The pore size distributions in Fig. 2d show the obvious porous structure, which is attributed to the formation of some chemical bond defects during the high-temperature calcination of melamine, so that the increased BET surface area can be obtained. However, the subsequent decrease of BET surface area is caused by the existence of AgBr NPs, which may block some pore structures of g-C3N4 nanosheets for the proper particle size. Also, the morphology and crystal structure of g-C3N4 and CNAA-2 are characterized by TEM. Obviously, the g-C3N4 presents a typical 2D flake graphite packing structure (Fig. 3a). Similarly, it can also be seen that some small particles are immobilized on 2D g-C3N4 surface, which is presumed to be AgBr NPs. Then, HRTEM image is displayed in Fig. 3b–d, and the lattice fringes of 0.28 nm can be observed clearly (Fig. 3c), which corresponds to the (200) crystal plane of AgBr (JCPDS 06-0438) [44]. Besides, the lattice fringes of 0.235 nm can be observed (Fig. 3d), which assigns to the (111) plane of Ag (JCPDS 04-0783) [45], and its Fourier transform diagram (FFT, as inset of Fig. 3b) also proves this conclusion. In addition, the selected region is characterized to be polycrystalline feature by a selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset of Fig. 3b) [46]. Then, the EDX mappings were used to analyze the element composition of CNAA-2 surface, and it indicates that the surface of CNAA-2 is composed of C, N, Ag and Br element. Meanwhile, EDX spectrum of Fig. 4 shows that the approximate content of each above element is respectively detected to be 41.91%, 55.10%, 1.57% and 1.42%, and it is consistent with XRD, EDX and TEM results, which indicates that the g-C3N4-Ag/AgBr photocatalyst was successfully prepared. The surface elemental compositions and chemical states of g-C3N4 and CNAA-2 were analyzed by XPS characterization. The C 1s peak was corrected according to the standard peak position. The survey spectra of Fig. 5a show that the Ag and Br element can be detected on the surface of CNAA-2 except the C and N element. Both the C 1s core-level spectra of g-C3N4 and CNAA-2 were fitted into three characteristic peaks with binding energy of 288.2, 286.0 and 284.6 eV (Fig. 5b), which correspond to the binding energy of (C-(N)3) [47], N-C=N [48] and CC [49] in g-C3N4 structure, respectively. Furthermore, four characteristic peaks with binding energy of 403.9, 400.7, 399.0 and 398.4 eV in the N 1s core-level spectra (Fig. 5c) are assigned to the binding energy of π-excitation [29], graphite N, N-(C)3 and C-N-C in g-C3N4 structure [50], which corresponding to oxidized pyridinic (pyridinic N+O−) nitrogens, graphitic, pyrrolic and pyridinic, respectively [51]. This proves the successful synthesis of graphite phase g-C3N4 [52]. The peaks of Ag 3d3/2 and Ag 3d5/2 can be respectively further fitted into two different peaks. The peaks at 374.1 and 367.7 eV can be assigned to the Ag 3d3/2 and Ag 3d5/2 of Ag+, and the peaks at 373.2 and 367.2 eV belong to the Ag 3d3/2 and Ag 3d5/2 of Ag0 (Fig. 5d). Two characteristic peaks of Br 3d5/2 and Br 3d3/2 are located at 67.7 eV and 68.7 eV (Fig. 5e), indicating the existence of Br− in CNAA-2 structure. Importantly, compared with g-C3N4, some binding energies of N 1s, Ag 3d and Br 3d in CNAA-2 shift slightly. Especially, the N 1s orbital shifts in the direction of high binding energy for the coordination interaction between amino groups with AgBr and Ag. The change of binding energy of Ag and Br indicates that electron transfer takes place between them. Ag loses electrons and leads to the binding energy shifting to the high field, and Br gains electrons and leads to the binding energy shifting to the low field. These results indicate that the Ag/AgBr NPs successfully grow on g-C3N4 surface, so the g-C3N4-Ag/AgBr heterostructure was indeed fabricated for effective formation of the interactional interfaces between different components. Besides, the XPS VBs was detected to confirm the valence band maximum (VBM) of AgBr and g-C3N4 (Fig. 5f), and it is about 1.8 and 1.4 eV, respectively."
9,Photochemical and electrochemical characterization,"3.2 Photochemical and electrochemical characterization UV–vis DRS was performed to analyze the light absorption ability of the samples (Fig. 6a). As shown as Fig. 6a and Table 1 , the maximum absorption edge of pristine g-C3N4 is about 497 nm, which shows that the g-C3N4 exhibits visible-light response. Due to the good photosensitive ability of AgBr, its absorption edge locates at 563 nm. Therefore, the photosensitive AgBr was in situ anchored on g-C3N4 surface to improve the light response. Obviously, the maximum absorption edge of CNAA-α heterostructure gradually shifts to the large wavelength with the increase of the amount of AgBr, indicating that the light absorption ability is greatly enhanced for AgBr introduction. According to the UV–vis DRS data, the corresponding band gaps of g-C3N4 and AgBr were calculated from Tauc equation (αhν)1/n = Α(hν − Ε g ) [53]. In this formula, the α, hν, E g and A respectively stands for the absorption coefficient, photon energy, band gap and constant. The n values of direct semiconductor and indirect semiconductor are 4 and 1. g-C3N4 is direct semiconductor, and AgBr is indirect semiconductor, so their n values are 4 and 1, respectively [54]. Then, the band gaps of g-C3N4 and AgBr were calculated as 2.77 and 1.9 eV (Fig. 6b), respectively. PL analysis was performed to detect the combination frequency of photo-induced carriers (Fig. 6c). When being induced by light with the wavelength of 340 nm, pure g-C3N4 exhibits a strong emission spectrum, indicating that the photo-induced carriers of g-C3N4 are very easy to combine. However, the emission peak intensity of the samples can be weakened gradually with increase of Ag/AgBr addition. For more positive conduction band (CB) of AgBr, the electrons on the CB of g-C3N4 can easily transfer to the CB of AgBr through their heterointerfaces, which in turn transfers to the surface Ag plasmas. Therefore, the combination of photo-induced carriers of g-C3N4 can be effectively inhibited, indicating that proper introduction of Ag/AgBr can form the good heterojunction between g-C3N4 and AgBr. Additionally, the fluorescence lifetime of g-C3N4 and CNAA-α were studied (Fig. 6d). When the samples are illuminated, then the light source was cut off in time. Apparently, the life attenuation curve of g-C3N4 presents more obvious trailing situation compared with that of CNAA-α, which also indicates the strong recombination ability of g-C3N4. In summary, above results indicate that the formation of the heterostructure accelerates the electron transfer at the heterointerface and effectively inhibits the combination of photogenerated electrons and holes. EIS analysis was performed to further detect the interfacial charge transfer ability. As shown as Fig. 7a, compared with g-C3N4, the Nyquist arc radius of CNAA-α is reduced obviously, and the radius of CNAA-2 is the smallest in the samples. Because the right amount of Ag/AgBr promotes the construction of effective heterostructure between the interfaces of g-C3N4 and AgBr, which accelerates the interfacial charges conduction significantly. However, the radius of CNAA-3 is larger than that of CNAA-2, indicating that the excess addition of AgBr impedes the fast interfacial charge transfer for the destruction of heterostructure. Fig. 7b displays the transient photocurrent responses of g-C3N4 and CNAA-α. Obviously, the photoelectron densities of CNAA-α samples are significantly enhanced when providing visible light irradiation (20 s). Furthermore, the photoelectron density of the sample increases gradually with the increase of Ag/AgBr components. It indicates that adding AgBr can increase the photoexcited carrier density of the sample for the superior photosensitive ability of AgBr. Therefore, under light illumination, the CNAA-α is more likely to be excited, which is also one reason for the improvement of photocatalytic performance. After that, the LSV curves were detected to characterize the samples (Fig. 7c) in a 0.2 M Na2SO4 electrolyte with three electrodes, and all the electrodes show the cathode current in the range of 0 to −2.5 V (relative to RHE). When the current densities are equal to −15 mA·cm−2, the onset potentials required for g-C3N4, CNAA-1, CNAA-2, and CNAA-3 are −2.27 V, −2.22 V, −2.20 V and −2.15 V, respectively (as Table 1). After adding AgBr, lower onset potential indicates that the interfacial charge migration between the sample and electrode is accelerated significantly. In addition, the Tafel slope can reflect the hydrogen production activity of the catalyst, so the linear part of the Tafel curves were used to conform the Tafel equation (η = b log j + α, α and b are two constants, α represents the overpotential value per unit current density (1A cm−2), and b is a constant mainly related to temperature) [55]. As shown in Fig. 7d, the Tafel slopes of g-C3N4, CNAA-1, CNAA-2 and CNAA-3 are 322.0, 157.0, 61.0 and 77.2 mV·dec−1, respectively. Furthermore, the corresponding overpotentials were also obtained according to the Tafel curves. When reach the current density of 100 mA·cm−2, their overpotentials are 465.3, 229.0, 86.5 and 106.6 mV (Table 1 and Fig. S2), respectively. Both the onset potential, overpotential and Tafel slope of CNAA-2 are the smallest in LSV and Tafel analysis, indicating that the decrease of breaking energy of CNAA-2 leads to the enhanced HER performance. In order to further reveal the heterostructure type between the interfaces of g-C3N4 and AgBr, M-S measurements were performed. In general, the positive and negative slope in M-S curves can be used to represent the n and p type of semiconductor. The negative slope represents a p-type semiconductor characteristic, while the positive slope represents a n-type semiconductor characteristic. Obviously, pristine g-C3N4 is a typical p-type semiconductor characteristic (Fig. 7e), and pristine AgBr is a typical n-type semiconductor (Fig. 7f), and we can also observe from that the flat band potential values of g-C3N4 and AgBr are 0.92 and −0.11 eV, respectively (Fig. S3) [56]. Therefore, in this study, the p-n heterojunction was successfully constructed on the interfaces between g-C3N4 and AgBr components."
10,Photocatalytic activity and photostability,"3.3 Photocatalytic activity and photostability In this process, the VLD activities of CNAA-α heterostructures for producing H2 were studied. The H2 was not detected in g-C3N4 within 6 h (Fig. 8a and Table 2 ), but the hydrogen production rates of CNAA-1, CNAA-2 and CNAA-3 in 6 h are approximately 41.07, 47.84, and 44.98 μmol·g−1·h−1 (Fig. 8b and Table 2), respectively. Furthermore, the amounts of hydrogen of all samples increase linearly (Fig. 8c), indicating that they have excellent photocatalytic activities and photostabilities. Relatively, the hydrogen production and its evolution rate of CNAA-2 within 6 h is the maximum. Therefore, when the amount of Ag/AgBr is proper, the effective heterojunction can be built at the interfaces of g-C3N4 and AgBr, so that the enhanced activity of hydrogen production can be obtained. In order to study the photostabilities of the CNAA-α heterostructures for hydrogen production, five recycling HER experiments were carried out under same conditions. Obviously, the hydrogen production activity of CNAA-2 only slightly decrease after 5 cycles (Fig. 8d), which may be due to the partial loss of catalyst in recovering process. To further study the structure stability of CNAA-2, the recycled sample was analyzed by XRD characterization. Obviously, the XRD pattern of recycled CNAA-2 does not present obvious change (Fig. 8e), indicating that the CNAA-2 sample possesses stable crystal structure. Therefore, above results indicate that the CNAA-2 heterostructure is a highly efficient and stable photocatalyst."
11,Photocatalytic mechanism of CNAA-2 heterostructure,"3.4 Photocatalytic mechanism of CNAA-2 heterostructure From the above conclusions, it can be concluded that AgBr as a co-catalyst, not only improves the light absorption of the sample, but also accelerates the transfer and separation of photo-induced carriers. Therefore, the recombination of light-excited carriers can be inhibited effectively, which greatly improves the VLD catalytic HER performance of the sample. On the one hand, AgBr was selected as the co-catalyst to improve the activity of g-C3N4 for superior photosensitive effect. By combining AgBr with g-C3N4, the composite will exhibit very enhanced visible-light response. Besides, compounding AgBr with g-C3N4, the formation of interfacial heterostructure between g-C3N4 and AgBr and generation of Ag plasmas with electron acceptor effect accelerate the interfacial charge transfer, improving the VLD photocatalytic HER performance. Fig. 7e and f shows that the p-n heterojunction was successfully constructed between g-C3N4 and AgBr. Besides, XRD and XPS characterizations prove that the Ag plasmas were also generated on the surface of AgBr. Under visible-light illumination, photocurrent will be generated on the surface of catalyst, then the photocurrent can be transferred at the p-n heterojunction interfaces. In fact, the p-n heterojunction is equivalent to a cathode-anode system. The electrons migrate towards the cathode side, then the released electrons on the cathode side are captured by water molecules, thus reducing to produce hydrogen. The general process of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and the detailed mechanism of photoexcited carrier transport and separation are shown in Fig. 9 . Under visible-light, electrons on more negative CB can spontaneously move to the more positive direction. Therefore, the electrons on the CB of g-C3N4 are first transferred to the CB of AgBr for its more negative potential, then the received and generated electrons on CB of AgBr can further transfer to the surface Ag plasma for its superior electron acceptor ability. For very high density of electrons on CB of AgBr and its Ag plasmas, the HER (H2O + e− → H2) can be easily induced for more negative potential than the hydrogen reduction potential (φH2/H+). Simultaneously, the holes on the VB of g-C3N4 and AgBr are immediately captured and quenched by the added TEOA with high concentration, thus hindering the rapid recombination of photoexcited carriers and the generation of oxidizing active radicals, which is also a very important reason for the improvement of HER performance of the sample."
12,Conclusions,"In this paper, to improve the VLD catalytic activity of two-dimensional g-C3N4, g-C3N4 and Ag/AgBr NPs were used as the carrier and cocatalyst, and the g-C3N4/Ag/AgBr (CNAA-α, α = 1, 2 and 3) heterojunctions with different amounts of Ag/AgBr were synthesized via solvothermal technology. The morphology, composition, structure, photoelectrochemical characteristics of the samples were analyzed through a series of characterizations, and the VLD catalytic hydrogen evolution activities of the samples for hydrogen evolution was studied by catalyzing water splitting. Research showed that the CNAA-2 exhibited the smallest overvoltage (86.5 mV vs RHE) and Tafel slope (61.0 mV·dec−1), so that the highest VLD catalytic activity (47.84 μmol·g−1·h−1) for hydrogen evolution was obtained at the absence of Pt co-catalyst. Furthermore, this heterojunction photocatalyst exhibited good photostability and could be recycled several times with no significant decrease of its activity. This indicated that the addition of Ag/AgBr NPs to the two-dimensional g-C3N4 nanosheets to construct an effective p-n heterojunction system at their interfaces could promote the conduction of photo-induced carriers and inhibit their combination, so that it would significantly improve the photoresponse ability and photocatalytic activity of two-dimensional g-C3N4 nanosheets."
