0,Introduction,"With the improvement of people's living standard, environmental pollution and energy shortage become more and more serious [1–3]. Therefore, finding a sustainable clean energy is the key to solve these problems [4–6]. As is known to all, hydrogen energy has high calorific value and no pollution to the environment, which is the best energy to replace the traditional non-renewable energy [7]. Photocatalytic split of water to produce hydrogen is an economical and environmentally friendly method for converting solar energy into hydrogen energy [8]. The catalysis technology based on photochemical reaction is called photocatalytic technology, which mainly deals with energy crisis and environmental pollution. It has been developing rapidly in the field of chemistry in recent years. It can be regarded as a relatively special chemical and physical process, through the light, under the action of catalyst can be converted water into clean hydrogen energy. Therefore, the research focus is to develop efficient, stable and cheap catalysts [9]. So far, a large number of semiconductors have been developed for photocatalytic split of water to produce hydrogen, such as metal oxides (TiO2 [10,11], ZnO [12], WO3 [13]), metal sulfides (CdS [14], MoS2 [15,16], Bi2S3 [17]) and nitrides (C3N4 [18–21]). In addition, some precious metals (Pt [22], Au [23], and Pd [24]) and phosphides (NiP [25], CoP [26,27]) have also been used for photocatalytic split of water to hydrogen production. Nickel-based material is an effective catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction. Ni(OH)2 has good electrochemical properties [28], ion exchange [29] and hydrothermal synthesis [30], etc. Ni(OH)2 has become a hotspot in the study of photoelectric materials [31,32]. However, due to the slow diffusion rate of protons in the layered structure, the composite rate of electrons and holes increases. Due to the change of band dielectric and magnetism caused by nanocomposites in the process of composites [33], nanocomposites are beneficial in improving the ion exchange capacity of thermal stability, high porosity, electrical conductivity, and good optical and catalytic properties [34]. According to previous reports, in order to further improve its performance, a built-in electric field [35,36] or a supported co-catalyst can be constructed by constructing heterojunctions to promote electron transfer in photocatalytic decomposition reactions, thus improving hydrogen production activity [37–41]. Bismuth-based semiconductor photocatalytic materials have a unique layered structure, which facilitates the effective separation and transfer of photocarriers between layers, thus obtaining a good photocatalytic performance [42,43]. Bi2S3 is a metal sulfide with spherical structure, promising in the field of visible photocatalysis, with a narrow band gap and a reasonable band gap of 1.3–1.7 eV [44–49]. It absorbs almost all the visible and near-infrared wavelengths of the sun and can be made simply by hydrothermal processes. However, the rapid recombination of charge carriers limits its application. Building heterojunction with Bi2S3 and another suitable semiconductor can solve the above problem. In this paper, nano-spherical Bi2S3 was prepared by simple hydrothermal method and then it combines with Ni(OH)2 by hydrothermal method, formed a n-n heterojunction. The composite catalyst Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2 obtained in the dye sensitization system had a high visible photocatalytic activity to decompose water to hydrogen production, excellent electrochemical properties and a large specific surface area. Fluorescence spectroscopy showed that the load of Bi2S3 promoted the photoelectron transfer of Ni(OH)2. We speculated the mechanism of dye sensitization photocatalytic split of water to produce hydrogen in the representational results."

In typical experiments, 10 mg of catalyst and 22 mg of EY were dissolved in 30 mL 10% (v/v) triethanolamine (TEOA) water solution, respectively by ultrasonic dispersion and magnetic stirring for 10 min. Then, N2 was used to remove air from the reactor, ensuring that the mixture reacts under anaerobic conditions. The reactor was placed in a multi-channel source using a 5 W LED (λ ≥ 420 nm) light source for hydrogen production (Perfect Light, PCX50B Discover). Hydrogen production was determined though gas chromatography (Ruili SP-2100, TCD, 13X column, N2 as carrier)."
7,Photoelectrochemical measurement,"2.6 Photoelectrochemical measurement A three-electrode electrochemical workstation (Versa Stat 4-400, Advanced Measurement Technology, Inc.) was used to test the photoelectrochemistry quizzes containing transient photocurrent responses (I-T), current intensity (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott-Schottky plots.

8,Results and discussion,
9,XRD analysis,"3.1 XRD analysis The crystal structures of samples Bi2S3, Ni(OH)2 and Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% were carried out XRD [50]. Fig. 1 (a) shows the diffraction peaks of Ni(OH)2 appear at 19.2°, 33.0°, 38.0°, 52.6°, 59.5° and 62.6°, which respectively belong to the (001), (100), (101), (102), (110) and (111) crystal planes of Ni(OH)2 (JCPDS No.14-0117). The characteristic peaks of Bi2S3 present in the composite catalyst can be indexed from the standard card (JCPDS No.89-8965). The diffraction peaks at 24.9°, 28.6°, 31.8° and 46.3° correspond to the (420), (221), (211) and (312) crystal planes of Bi2S3. However, in the composite catalyst Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10%, the peak of Bi2S3 is relatively low, which is due to the low content of loaded Bi2S3. Further, according to the Scherrer formula, the average particle diameters of Bi2S3 and Ni(OH)2 are calculated to be 35.24 nm and 16.57 nm, respectively [51]. The diffraction peaks of Ni(OH)2 in all samples have not moved significantly, which proves an evidence that the structure of Ni(OH)2 has not been damaged after loading Bi2S3. Fig. 1(b) shows the XRD pattern of the composite catalyst Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–5%, Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10%, Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–15%, Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–20%, and Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–30%. From the figure it can be seen that the characteristic peaks of Bi2S3 and Ni(OH)2 have not changed. Only with the increase of Bi2S3 load, the characteristic peak strength of Bi2S3 in the composite catalyst increased. Overall, the XRD results confirm that the composite Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2 catalyst is successfully prepared."
10,SEM and TEM analysis,"3.2 SEM and TEM analysis The SEM image of pure Ni(OH)2 has a 3D nano-flower structure, which is composed of many smooth nano-flakes and the size of Ni(OH)2 is around 6 μm, as proven in Fig. 2 (a). However, unlike the two-dimensional nanosheet structure, the three-dimensional nanoflower structure avoids the stacking of the nanosheets, thus exposing more edge active sites. In addition, the three-dimensional nano-flower structure has good advantages in the adsorption of EY and nanoparticles. Fig. 2(b) shows the SEM image of Bi2S3, and Bi2S3 is spherical particles. Fig. 2(c) shows the SEM image of Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10%, Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2 composite catalyst of Ni(OH)2 rich layers not only offers Bi2S3 attachment sites, but also for Bi2S3 has good dispersion effect, due to the load Bi2S3, make the edge of the Ni(OH)2 appear jagged, provides evidence that the load of Bi2S3 causes defects in Ni(OH)2, which increases the catalyst specific surface area, provides more active sites, and enhances the photocatalytic capacity to split of water to produce hydrogen. The TEM photograph of the composite catalyst Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10%, and it can be observed that Bi2S3 is successfully loaded on Ni(OH)2, as shown in Fig. 2(d). Fig. 2(e) shows the HRTEM images can reflect the deep structural features of Bi2S3 and Ni(OH)2. The lattice spacing of 0.28 nm corresponds to the (221) crystal plane of Bi2S3 and the lattice spacing of 0.137 nm corresponds to the (110) crystal plane of Ni(OH)2. Fig. 2 (f) is energy dispersive EDX, indicating that Ni, Bi, O, S and C elements are contained in the compound catalyst Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10%. In addition, according to EDX/HAADF mapping analysis (Fig. 2g-k), the composite catalyst Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% is consisted of elements Ni, Bi, O, S, and uniformly distributed in the sample."
11,XPS analysis,"3.3 XPS analysis Fig. 3 shows the XPS test results of sample Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10%. As shows in Fig. 3(a), the full spectrum of XPS. It is proved that Bi, S, O, and Ni exist in the composite optical electrode Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10%. Fig. 3(b) shows in Ni 2p location of the spectra the binding power peaks at 856.27 eV and 874 eV are attributed to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, and two satellite peaks corresponding to Ni2+ in Ni(OH)2 appear at the binding energies of 861.97 eV and 879.97 eV [52]. As show in Fig. 3(c), the Bi3+ of Bi2S3 is divided into two peaks of Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2, which is at 158.70 eV and 164.0 eV, respectively [53,54]. As proven in Fig. 3(d), the spectrum of element O, showing that the binding energy at 531.28 eV belongs to element O in the hydroxyl group (OH) in Ni(OH)2 [55]. As shown in Fig. 3(e), the high-resolution spectrum of S element. The peaks of 158.80 eV and 164.00 eV matched with S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 of Bi2S3, and the satellite peak of 168.00 eV corresponds to S 2p [56,57]."
12,BET analysis,"3.4 BET analysis Fig. 4 (a) shows the adsorption-desorption isotherms of Bi2S3, Ni(OH)2 and Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10%. From the figure can observe that the composite catalyst Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% is an H3-type hysteretic loop of mesoporous structure of IV adsorption and desorption isotherm [58]. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the aperture distribution curves of Bi2S3, Ni(OH)2 and Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10%. A similar curve is shown. The composite material Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% is approximately the mesoporous structure of 0–50 nm. The specific surface area of Ni(OH)2 is 21.31 m2/g, and after loading Bi2S3, the specific surface area increased to 32.00 m2/g can clearly observed in Table 1 . The large specific surface area is beneficial to the adsorption of more EY molecules and the rapid transfer of electrons, thus improving the photocatalytic activity to produce hydrogen."
13,Photocatalytic H2 evolution performances,"3.5 Photocatalytic H2 evolution performances Fig. 5 (a) shows the H2 production of pure Ni(OH)2 is only 48 μmol within 5 h, while the maximum H2 evolution of the composite catalyst after adding Bi2S3 in the same conditions (22 mg EY, pH = 10 TEOA-H2O) is 119 μmol, which is 12 times and 2.5 times of the hydrogen evolution of Bi2S3 and Ni(OH)2, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the H2 production of the composite catalyst varies with the load of Bi2S3 during the preparation process. When the load of Bi2S3 increases from 5% to 10%, the hydrogen production increases from 78 to 95 μmol. However, as the load of Bi2S3 continues to increase, excess Bi2S3 again becomes a composite center of electrons and holes, lead to decreasing in the photocatalytic activity to produce hydrogen. The pH of the photocatalytic reaction system has a notably influence on activity to product hydrogen. The composite catalyst Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% hydrogen production is compared when the pH of the solution is from 8 to 11, as shown in Fig. 5(c). When pH is equal to 10, the system produces the maximum amount of hydrogen, which reaches 100 μmol moles in 5 h. As the pH of the sacrificial agent increases or decreases, hydrogen production decreases. This is because TEOA tends to be protonized in acidic environment, resulting in shorter EY life, lower efficiency and lower hydrogen production. The decrease of H+ concentration in alkaline environment leads to the decrease of hydrogen evolution kinetics. The amount of sensitizer added has a certain influence on the H2 evolution system. The hydrogen evolution of the composite catalyst Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% is compared when EY addition is from 16 mg to 24 mg, as shown in Fig. 5(d). When the amount of EY added goes from 16 to 22 mg, the amount of hydrogen produced goes from 55 to 119 μmol. However, when the addition of EY continues to increase, the composite catalyst Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% hydrogen evolution decreases. Increasing the amount of EY can promote the transfer of photoelectrons and improve the photocatalytic performance. But, when excess EY is added, the shielding effect of EY hinders the absorption of light by the photocatalyst, reducing the electron transfer rate and inhibiting the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. So as to test the stability of the catalyst, the TEOA solution with sensitizer is stabilized. As shown in Fig. 5(e), the experiment is divided into four cycles. In the first cycle, the hydrogen evolution of the composite catalyst increased steadily within 5 h. This is because the large specific surface area of Ni(OH)2 provides the electron channel, while the cocatalyst Bi2S3 provides the electron outlet, and the EY also provides a part of the electrons. Under their combined action, the system shows stable and efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production by water decomposition. Before each cycle begins, N2 instead of the gas in the reaction system and no additional EY is added. In these cycles, hydrogen production decreases because the EY degrades slightly with reaction time. Because of the poor stability of sensitizers, EY is degraded over time under light conditions. When the fourth cycle finished, the hydrogen evolution had reduced by around 30% compared to the first cycle due to long-term exposure the EY sensitizer will degrade. The XRD patterns of Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% composite catalyst before and after hydrogen production are compared to further evaluate the stability of the catalyst. As shown in Fig. 5(f), the obtained spectra indicate that the phase of the composite catalyst has not changed before and after hydrogen generation. In general, the composite catalyst Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% has high stability."
14,Photoluminescence analysis,"3.6 Photoluminescence analysis It is generally believed that the PL signal is closely related to the electron and hole recombination. Fig. 6 shows the photoelectron migration of EY, EY-Ni(OH)2, EY-Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% is studied by steady-state PL experiment. When the excitation wavelength is 538 nm, pure EY shows strong fluorescence intensity, indicating that its photoelectron-hole pair recombination is serious. When Ni(OH)2 photocatalyst is added, at the same wavelength appears the emission peak. However, the intensity is slightly lower and quenching occurred [59]. The photoluminescence intensity of EY-Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% is the lowest among all samples. It indicates that the composite catalyst can effectively inhibit the photoelectron and hole recombination. And the composite catalyst is more conducive to the photocatalytic reaction of the system. Photoluminescence conforms to the trend of photocatalytic hydrolysis for hydrogen evolution, which the addition of Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% is more conducive to the photocatalytic reaction of the system also can be observed."
15,UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra,"3.7 UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra As shown in Fig. 7 , in order to further investigate why the composite material has better photocatalytic activity, UV–visible diffuse reflection spectra of Bi2S3, Ni(OH)2 and Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% products. The absorption of Ni(OH)2 is weak in visible light, while the absorption of Bi2S3 is strong and wide. Since the color of the catalyst is also one of the factors affecting the absorption intensity of light, and the pure Bi2S3 is black, the absorption intensity of the composite catalyst Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% is lower than that of the pure Bi2S3. The absorption edge of Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% catalyst has obvious redshift [60] and the broadening of Bi2S3 into the visible region was achieved by loading Ni(OH)2 [61–64], which shows good optical adsorption under light stimulation. Therefore, Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% catalyst has good photocatalytic activity. According to previous reports, the band gap of Ni(OH)2 and Bi2S3 are 4.2 eV [65] and 1.49 eV [46]. Fig. 7(b) shows the band gap of the composite catalyst Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% is 3.68 eV. The Eg of composite catalyst Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% was less than that of Ni(OH)2, illustrating that the addition of Bi2S3 reduces the bandgap of the composite catalyst Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% and make it easier to be excited, thus improving the electron migration rate and promoting the catalyst hydrogen evolution activity."
16,Photoelectrochemical properties,"3.8 Photoelectrochemical properties So as to better understand the electron transfer process of catalyst, photochemical test was carried out in 0.2 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 8 (a), the samples Bi2S3, Ni(OH)2 and Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% get the instantaneous photocurrent-time curve under visible light by controlling the circulation of open-close light. The photocurrent density of the composite catalyst Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% is the highest. This indicates that loading Bi2S3 on Ni(OH)2 is making for enhancing the separation of photoelectron from holes and inhibiting photogenerated charge recombination, which has the same results of H2 evolution and PL. The activity of H2 evolution by the photocatalytic split of water is related to the overpotential of the sample. Bi2S3, Ni(OH)2 and Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% were studied by LSV. Fig. 8(b) shows the composite Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% electrode exhibited the lowest overpotential at the same voltage. Considering that the activity of catalysts in photocatalysis depends on overpotential [66], it is further proved that the composite Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% is an effective photocatalytic catalyst for hydrogen production by water decomposition. The EIS impedance maps of Bi2S3, Ni(OH)2 and Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10%, as proven in Fig. 8(c). The diameter of the semicircle in the curve reflects the impedance of the interfacial charge transfer. As can be seen from the Fig. 8(c), the semicircle diameter of the sample Ni(OH)2, Bi2S3, Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% decreases once. The results show that the interface resistance of the single Ni(OH)2 electrode is the largest, which is not conducive to the efficient transfer of charge[67–69]. It can be observed that the order of resistance of electron transmission is Ni(OH)2 > Bi2S3 > Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10%, which demonstrates that the electrode impedance of Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% is the smallest. And Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% can improve the ability of internal charge separation and transfer. Fig. 8(d) is the mott-schottky diagram of Bi2S3 and Ni(OH)2. It shows that both Bi2S3 and Ni(OH)2 have positive slopes, so both Bi2S3 and Ni(OH)2 are n-type semiconductors. According to previous report [46,65], the flat band potential (Efb) of Bi2S3 and Ni(OH)2 can be calculated as −0.9 V and −1.2 V. Because the CB edge of n-type semiconductor is 0–0.1 eV higher than the plane potential. Then, the formula is: ENHE = ESCE + 0.24 V [70]. The ECB value of Bi2S3 is calculated to be −0.76 V, and the ECB value of Ni(OH)2 is −1.06 V. The CB and VB positions of the individual semiconductors can be calculated by empirical formulas: EVB = ECB + Eg [71,72]. The band gaps of Bi2S3 and Ni(OH)2 are 1.1 eV and 4.2 eV , respectively. The EVB of Bi2S3 and Ni(OH)2 are calculated to be 0.73 eV and 3.14 eV."
17,Proposed reaction mechanism,"3.9 Proposed reaction mechanism According to the experimental results of this work, the mechanism of photocatalytic water splitting is described, as shown in Fig. 9 . Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% catalyst can absorb a number of EY dyes. Under light conditions, visible light photons are absorbed by EY molecules, forming a singlet excited EY1*, and then transiting to stable triple excited state (EY3*). In the reaction system, TEOA can reduce EY3* to EY−* with strong reducibility [73]. Electrons can be transferred rapidly from EY−* to the conduction band of Bi2S3 and Ni(OH)2. EY−* has lost electrons forms EY molecules at the same time. Since the initial CB potential (−1.06 eV) of Ni(OH)2 is lower than that of Bi2S3 (−0.76 eV), e− further migrate from the CB of Ni(OH)2 to the CB of Bi2S3, and h+ also transfer from the VB of Ni(OH)2 to the VB of Bi2S3. The e− and h+ accumulate in Bi2S3 and form n-n heterojunctions on the surface of Ni(OH)2. Photogenerated electrons clustered on Bi2S3 reduce H+ to H2, while holes in Bi2S3 are consumed by TEOA. The formation of heterojunctions between Bi2S3 and Ni(OH)2 effectively enhanced e− and h+ separation, so the composite material has better photocatalytic HER activity than Ni(OH)2 alone. The corresponding chemical reaction is as follows: EY → h ν EY 1 ∗ → ISC EY 3 ∗ + T E O A → EY - + TEOA + EY - ( e - ) → N i O H 2 ( e CB - ) → Bi 2 S 3 ( e CB - ) 2 e - + 2 H 2 O → H 2 + 2 OH - h + + T E O A → TEOA + Ni ( O H ) 2 → h υ e CB - + h VB + h VB + → Bi 2 S 3 h VB + + T E O A → TEOA +"
18,Conclusion,"The n-n heterojunction composite catalyst Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% is successfully designed and prepared. The Composite catalyst Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2 has a high photocatalytic activity to hydrogen production that is about 12 times and 2.5 times higher than that of Bi2S3 nanoparticles and Ni(OH)2. The structure of n-n heterojunction can promote the separation of electrons and holes. Specifically, floral Ni(OH)2 provides lots of attachment points for Bi2S3 nanoparticles and eosin. The hydrogen evolution activity of photocatalytic water under visible light irradiation is enhanced. The result of PL shows that the composite catalyst Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% has high charge separation efficiency. Photochemical tests have proved that the composite catalyst Bi2S3/Ni(OH)2–10% has a high separation of photoelectron from holes. These results also indicate that Bi2S3 nanoparticles as hydrogen-producing catalyst is a robust strategy to improve the photocatalytic hydrogen production by Ni(OH)2 photocatalytic decomposition of water. This work identifies the potential of n-n heterojunction catalysts and this strategy is expected to be extended to the synthesis of similar catalysts."
