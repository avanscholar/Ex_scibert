0,Introduction,"The growing global needs highlighted in material and energy resources, considering the use and prospect of depletion of natural and fossil sources associated with growing and justified environmental concerns, promote great interest in the search for renewable sources, in the areas of matter and energy. In this way, sustainable food, chemical inputs and clean energy production must converge. An interesting example of the appeal of this topic and the potential economic interest involved is the development of the process for the synthesis of polyethylene furanoate (PEF) from sugar-based plants. This bio-based polymer is expected to progressively replace polyethylene terephthalate (PET) with beverage bottle production and many major companies have already invested or plan to carry out this strategy (for example, Coca-Cola, Ford Moto, Heinz, Nike and P&G) (Fasolini et al., 2019). Following the approach justified above, research on the rational use of carbohydrates from plant biomass is considered interesting. Of these natural renewable materials, it is possible to select and use saccharides, considering their high content. The production route that leads to polyols, given their lignocellulosic or starch origin, has shown itself to be of worldwide interest, and is growing at the rate that it presents itself as a range of economically viable alternatives (Almohalla et al., 2018; Vijaya Shanthi et al., 2018; Werpy and Petersen, 2004). Cellulose, the most abundant polymeric carbohydrate in biomass, consists of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen, receiving considerable attention in this context as a vitally renewable alternative to fossil fuels. In this same domain, the polymeric carbohydrate hemicellulose remains in the second level of presence in biomass, in which xylose and arabinose units constitute its structure. Transformations by catalytic action occur over these compounds involving the numerous CO and CC bonds, consisting of a set of possibilities for obtaining a varied range of derivatives. From the polymeric structure, via hydrolysis, oligomers and monomers are obtained, which can be chemically functionalized. Then, according to the hydrogenating transformation pathway, these compounds in their smallest units (monomers, dimers, …) can be hydrogenated by providing other monomers (hydrolysis), larger polyols (hydrogenation) and by hydrogenolysis resulting in smaller polyols, glycolysis and alcohols. The saccharides obtained from acid hydrolysis of biomass are mostly hexoses and pentoses, such as fructose, xylose, and glucose (Chheda et al., 2007). An alternative, with satisfactory results for converting biomass into chemicals of industrial interest, involves the extraction and decomposition of cellulose or hemicellulose into glucose or xylose arabinose oligomers, from which they can be extracted as monomers and in large quantities by through the acid hydrolysis process, generally using diluted sulfuric and/or hydrochloric acid (Li et al., 2017; Miranda et al., 2012; Vijaya Shanthi et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019). By hydrogenation or hydrogenolysis in aqueous media, polyols are produced as chemicals with higher added value. In particular, originated from cellulosic glucose, sorbitol can be produced in large quantities, being considered one of the most important platforms composed in biomass conversion programs (Almohalla et al., 2018). From the hemicellulosic fraction by hydrolysis with liquid mineral acids (diluted sulfuric acid), monomers and other smaller oligomers are produced. Similarly, from the monomer xylose, xylitol, its polyol produced by hydrogenating functionalization, is obtained. Following acid hydrolysis of cellulosic and hemicellulosic saccharides, hydrogenations occur in the presence of catalysts composed of supports such as silica, zeolite, alumina, titanium dioxide, carbon nanofibers, activated carbon and with active metallic phases (nickel, ruthenium, rhodium, platinum, palladium, copper) (Liu et al., 2019; Schmal, 2011; Zhao et al., 2010). In particular, activated carbon is widely used in the systems indicated for hydrogenating processes due to its high surface areas and stability at high temperatures and pressures. For industrial application, nickel is a viable metal for catalytic hydrogenation processes, taking into account the relationship between cost and its catalytic performance (Liu et al., 2015; Vijaya Shanthi et al., 2018). The selective hydrogenation of xylose has diverse industrial applications, such as cosmetic, food, pharmaceutical and resin industries (Mishra et al., 2013). High pressure autoclave equipment is often used to produce xylitol from xylose in batch systems (Mikkola et al., 2003). However, more recently, xylitol was produced in a continuous reactor (Fehér et al., 2018), operating under 90 bar and with a volumetric flow of 10 mL min−1, reaching a high yield (97%). The disadvantage of this application is the high assembly, maintenance, operation costs. The leaching of the metals supported over the catalyst at high pressures and temperatures is another frequent problem, which was investigated by Wang et al. (2018), due to the possibility of decreasing the hydrogenation yield. Under more severe conditions of temperature and pressure, when hydrogenolysis occurs, catalysts produced from metals such as nickel, but added with ruthenium, platinum or palladium, are used efficiently in the conversion of sorbitol and xylitol to produce other smaller polyols and glycols (Hoffer and Prochazka, 2010; Xiao et al., 2017). According to Aho et al. (2015), the particle size is an important parameter to be taken into consideration. The authors identified that the glucose hydrogenation reaction is a structure-sensitive reaction, reporting that ruthenium particles of 3 nm are ideal catalysts. Given the scenario of the valorization of renewable plant resources, the objective of this work was to obtain polyols from biomass, considering the availability of extracted carbohydrates originated from hemicellulose of plants, and their conversions with emphasis on the production of xylitol and derivatives. In this direction, xylose hydrolysis-hydrogenation processes were used, using researched and established catalytic conditions, and using catalysts supported with different levels of metallic phases. The present work specific goals were the following: • Formulate mono and bi-metallic catalysts, prepared by wet impregnation and characterized; • Carry out reaction tests with the catalysts prepared in a batch reactor, performing analysis through high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); • Evaluate the holocellulose acid hydrolysis efficiency using dilute sulfuric acid; • Evaluate the kinetic evolution of the xylose-rich hydrolysate catalytic hydrogenation."
1,Methodology,
2,Synthesis of Ni–Ru/C catalyst,"2.1 Synthesis of Ni–Ru/C catalyst The method of preparation of the supported catalysts consisted of three stages: wet impregnation, drying and reduction (Payal and Vaidya, 2018). Activated carbon with average particle size of 95 μm (particle sizes range: 85–105 μm) was supplied by Carbomafra S/A (Brazil) and was thoroughly washed with boiled water. Aqueous solutions were prepared with the precursor salts, namely ruthenium chloride trihydrate, RuCl3·3H2O (99% A.P. Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), and nickel nitrate hexahydrate, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (97 % A.P. Vetec, Brazil). The concentration of each salt was determined so the catalyst had a resulting metallic composition of 10% Ni and 1% Ru (w/w), maintaining a solution volume/support mass ration of 15 mL g−1. For each impregnation, the solution was kept in continuous stirring for 48 h at room temperature. After each impregnation, the suspension was filtrated, and the solids were transferred to the oven at 70 °C for 24 h. The oven-dried material was then subjected to a reduction step at 500 °C for 3 h and continuous flow of a mixture of hydrogen and argon (flow rates: 50 cm3 H2 min−1 and 50 cm3 Ar min−1). According to the results obtained, we can state that the system works under a diffusion resistance-free regime, with no considerable resistance to mass transfer, based on the Weisz criterion (Villermaux, 1993), and estimating the effective diffusivity through the Wilde-Chang correlation (Bird et al., 2006)."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Characterization procedures aimed to determine the essential characteristics of the prepared catalysts, which are related to their performance in chemical reactions. Moreover, characterization techniques allow predictions of the catalyst selectivity and stability and were selected based on the feasibility of applying the analytical technique for powdered solids and access to equipment. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out in an X-ray diffractometer model D-8 Advance (Bruker), through a source of Cu-Kα radiation with a voltage of 30 kV and a current of 30 mA. The angle of diffraction (2θ) varied from 5 to 80º with 0.05° pitch and intervals of 2.0 s. The obtained XRD patterns were assessed according the respective Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) for ruthenium and nickel in the metallic form. Specific surface area assessment, was performed in a surface area analyzer model Coulter Ominisorp 100CX, in which adsorption isotherms were obtained after vacuum gasification procedure (of the order of 10−6 Torr), using synthetic N2 atmosphere at 77 K as adsorbate gas. TGA analysis was performed on a thermogravimetric analyzer model STA 6000 (Perkin Elmer) with a heating rate of 20.0 °C min−1, under a flow of 20.0 mL min−1 of N2. The initial mass of material used in the platinum melting pot was fixed at 10.0 mg and they were heated from 30 °C to 800 °C. The results obtained were treated with the aid of the Pyris Data Analysis software, version 11. The determination of the zero-point charge (pHZPC) was performed by placing 0.1 g of the Ni–Ru/C in contact with distilled water, in flasks which pH ranged between 2 and 11. Initial and final pH’s (pHinitial) were measured in a pHmeter (Mettler Toledo, Brazil) and were adjusted with the addition of HCl and NaOH solutions (0.1 mol L−1). All samples were then placed in an orbital table under agitation of 300 rpm for 24 h and their final pH’s (pHfinal) were measured. For the determination of pHZPC, the graph (pHfinal – pHinitial) versus pHinitial was ploted, in which the curve that intersects the axis of the pHinital corresponds to the point in which the difference of surface charges of the material was zero."
4,Lignin extraction and bagasse acid hydrolysis,"2.3 Lignin extraction and bagasse acid hydrolysis The lignin extraction process consisted of four different extract steps. For the first three steps, the temperature and agitation conditions were the same (70 °C and 350 rpm). The temperature and agitation parameters for the fourth step was 90 °C and 350 rpm. First, 20.00 ± 0.01 g of sugarcane bagasse was introduced in the stirred-tank reactor, shown in Fig. 1 , with 400 mL of HCl 0.5 % (v/v) aqueous solution. In the second extraction, lignin was extracted using 250 mL of NH4OH 0.5 % (v/v), followed by an extraction with 250 mL of absolute ethanol. The last step was the subsequent acid hydrolysis, performed in the same reactor, using 400 mL of H2SO4 1.0%, 2.0% and 2.5% (v/v). After each step, the solid material was thoroughly washed with distilled water and oven-dried for 24 h at 60 °C. For each step, the extraction time was 240 min, keeping the extraction temperature constant. Samples were collected hourly for further analysis. Furthermore, holocellulosic material (without lignin) was submitted to acid hydrolysis reactions of hemicellulose contained in the material in the same reactor used to extract lignin. The acid hydrolysis reactions were performed using H2SO4 solutions of different concentrations (0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0% v/v). At each experiment the temperature of the reaction environment was kept constant under 90 °C for a total reaction time of 4 h, with sampling every 1 h of reaction and under atmospheric pressure, and stirring speed of 350 rpm. The liquid fraction of this stage corresponded to the xylose-rich hydrolysate."
5,Hydrogenation of xylose,"2.4 Hydrogenation of xylose The procedure description consisted of the addition of 500 mL of the hydrolysate solution from the acidic hydrolysis step of the hemicellulosic fraction in the presence of H2SO4 in the respective concentrations (0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0% v/v). In the preparation of the solution to be processed, neutralization using calcium hydroxide was required and the amount to be added for neutralization was calculated from stoichiometry. After neutralizing the hydrolysate solution, the hydrogenation reaction was performed in the presence of 5 g of the Ni–Ru/C catalyst. Catalytic evaluation of the Ni–Ru/C catalyst was carried out by hydrogenation reactions, which were performed in a three-phase slurry reactor, model PARR 3543 (Fig. 2 ). The stainless-steel reactor was electrically heated with a PID controller for temperature control. The system operated in batch for the solid and liquid phases and semi-continuous for the gas phase. Finally, H2 was injected into the reactor through a valve at the top of the reactor keeping the total pressure of the same constant (500 psi) with the help of a transducer and a gas regulating valve. The reaction temperature was measured through thermocouples and regulated according to specific controllers. After the reactor reached the set temperature and pressure for the reaction (100 °C and 500 psi), we started the sample collection, taking as initial processing time ""t0"". Samples of 3.0 mL was then collected every 0.5 h through a porous diffuser immersed in the liquid. The reactor was closed for the liquid (hydrolysate solution) and solid phases (Ni–Ru/C catalyst), in which the catalyst remained in suspension form in the liquid phase. Hydrogen (in a semi-open system) was introduced from a porous device of 2.0 μm diameter; the pressure was kept constant at 500 psi with the help of a regulating valve. The temperature was set according to the process temperature (100 °C). Sampling was performed in the liquid phase every 1 h of reaction processing. The collected samples were diluted 1:5 (v/v) and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography – HPLC. The analysis method used for reaction monitoring is described below."
6,Reagent and product analysis,"2.5 Reagent and product analysis The monitoring of reagents and products was performed through high performance liquid chromatography technique – HPLC, combined with an interface model 350 (Hitachi) with refractive index detection. The applied method used the column series AMINEX HPX-87H (300 × 7.8 mm, particle size of 9 μm), suitable for the separation of xylitol and xylose. The mobile phase was H2SO4 solution (4.0 mmol L−1) with a flow rate of 0.6 mL min−1 and column temperature of 50 °C, heated by a thermally controlled oven. For determination of reagent and product concentrations, the external standardization method was used, where solutions of known concentrations were injected and their areas were obtained. In order to obtain a relationship between area and concentration, an analytical curve was determined, which was plotted for the respective carbohydrate (xylose) and polyol (xylitol) from the carbohydrate."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Ni–Ru/C characterization,"3.1 Ni–Ru/C characterization Catalyst was characterized by XRD, BET specific surface area and pore volumes, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), assessment of zero-point charge and catalyst activity, as described in Section 2.1. BET analysis showed that the specific surface area of Ni–Ru/C decreases to more than half in comparison to active carbon data (Table 1 ), indicating the occupation of the support surface by Ru and Ni particles. Despite the specific surface area being a significant variable in adsorptive processes, and consequently in heterogeneous catalysis, the synterization of the metallic element on the support is essential to assure the catalyst selectivity. Both BET isotherms (Fig. 3 a and b) can be characterized as type IV, which is characteristic of mesoporous materials, according to IUPAC technical report for pore size distribution (Pessôa et al., 2019; Thommes et al., 2015). In these materials, the interactions between adsorbent and gas sorbate in might also take place in condensate state; moreover, the natural condition for hollocellulose hydrolysis conducted in this work is heterogeneous liquid-solid reaction (Payal and Vaidya, 2018). XRD patterns of pure activated carbon (Fig. 3c) exhibits an intense peak at 2θ = 28º, which can be associated to a carbonaceous layered structure, specific for graphitic materials (Pessôa et al., 2019). In the case of bimetallic Ru–Ni/C catalysts, characteristic diffraction peaks corresponding to FCC Ni° reflections were observed at 2θ = 44,5°, 47°, 61° and 63° (JCPDS card No. 04-850) related to (111), (200), and (220) crystallographic planes, respectively. In addition, Ru° reflections were detected at 2θ = 38.8°, 69.6° and 78.4° (JCPDS No. 00-006–0663), indicating the presence of Hexagonal Close Packing (HCP) Ru° nanoparticles. Thus, the most intense diffraction peaks of Ru° at 2θ = 43.8° and Ni° at 2θ = 44.5° overlapped. An expanded region of XRD analysis for Ru–Ni/C is shown in Fig. 3d. A shift of the resulting peak was observed towards lower angles as the atomic percentage of Ru was increased. Similar behavior has been reported by different authors in the literature (Liu et al., 2011; Romero et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2014). In the case of Ru–Ni/C, overlapped peak is close to 2θ = 44.5° since these catalysts had the highest nickel metal loading. However, this peak moved around 2θ = 43.8° for Ru–Ni/C because in this case Ru–Ni ratio was the highest one in comparison with the other bimetallic catalysts. Thermogravimetric analysis with derivative thermogravimetric (TGA/DTG) showed an intense mass loss at 100 °C (nearly 10%), which is attributed to the decrease of moisture adsorbed in the catalyst (Fig. 4 a). Then, the second weigh decrease is observed at temperature 500 °C, which is attributed to residual organic matter uptake. This behavior evidences the high thermal stability of Ni–Ru/C catalyst. Fig. 4b shows that pHZPC of the activated carbon was 6.3, evidencing that in this pH, all charges distributed on the surface are neutralized. In this sense, for pH’s greater than pHZPC, the liquid surface charge is negative, thus attracting cationic species. For pH's below pHZPC, the surface charge is positive, which favors the adsorption of anionic compounds (Regalbuto, 2006). Thus, since during the wet impregnation step, the solution pH was nearly 7, the activated carbon surface charge was negative, favoring the adsorption of the metallic cations."
9,Xylose extraction from sugarcane bagasse,"3.2 Xylose extraction from sugarcane bagasse Due to the importance of the product obtained from acid hydrolysis (pentosans), the results were expressed in grams of xylose from the data of HPLC analysis, as described in Table 2 . From the kinetic evolution of lignin production (Fig. 5 a–b) it is possible to verify that the reaction reached the maximum extraction after 4 h. According to Fig. 5b, it is noted that as the concentration of the acid solution increased, a higher amount of xylose was obtained from the pretreated holocellulose. This is due to the fact that H2SO4 played the role of a homogeneous catalyst for the hydrolysis of hemicellulose, and allowed the catalytic cleavage of the bonds present in hemicellulose. The present work studied up to the maximum concentration of acid 2.5 % v/v. High concentrations of xylose obtained in the hydrolysis process evidenced the effectiveness of the pre-treatment methodology used (with HCl, NH4OH and ethanol). Finally, the effect of the parameters (temperature, concentration of solutions, rotation, etc.) in xylose production might be subject of further research."
10,Hydrogenation of hydrolyzed compounds of the hemicellulosic fraction,"3.3 Hydrogenation of hydrolyzed compounds of the hemicellulosic fraction The catalytic hydrogenation of the biomass hydrolysates obtained by acid hydrolysis considered processing H2SO4 acid solutions of xylose with Ni–Ru/C catalyst during 4 h, at 373 K. Xylose (X) was converted up 99 % to produce xylitol (XL) with selectivity S X L = 10 2 C X L C X 0 - C X nearly 80%. This conclusion is in agreement with the literature regarding the yield of xylitol production from hemicellulosic hydrolysate (López-Linares et al., 2018), with results higher than those obtained using soybean hull biomass hydrolysate (50%) (Chen et al., 2019; da Cunha-Pereira et al., 2017)."
11,Kinetic of hydrogenation of the hydrolyzed biomass,"3.4 Kinetic of hydrogenation of the hydrolyzed biomass Considering the production of xylose in different hydrolysates, their processing with the formulated catalyst was evaluated with a view to converting them into xylitol. In this case, operations were carried out at 100 °C and 500 psi for the considering the production of xylose in different hydrolysates, its processing with the formulated catalyst was evaluated. In this case, the operations were carried out at 100 °C and 500 psi for the hydrolysate solutions obtained in operations with 1.0 % (v/v), 2.0 % (v/v) and 2.5 % (v/v) H2SO4), and treated with calcium hydroxide to neutralize and remove sulfur residues. The kinetic behavior of the hydrogenation process of this hydrolyzed is represented in Fig. 6 (a, b, c) shown decreasing residual concentration of xylose and corresponding increasing production. Xylose conversion X X = C X 0 - C X C X 0 × 10 2 reached higher levels after 90 min of reaction for the three different acid hydrolysates, while high yield of xylitol was obtained. These results show that the synthesized bimetallic catalyst is efficient to conduct the xylose hydrogenation. This behavior is in agreement with recent works found in the literature (García Martín et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2019). In the sequence of evaluation, the processing carried out at 353 K and 393 K, under the conditions tested at 373 K (Fig. 6), complemented the evaluation of the hydrogenation of the biomass hemicellulose acid hydrolysates, referring to that obtained with 2.5% H2SO4 (v/v). Table 3 lists the results obtained in the operations carried out at the three temperatures, expressed in terms of xylose concentrations. To represent the observed kinetic behavior, a mathematical model was proposed (Eq. (3)), considering the participation of the components of the liquid phase, hydrogen gas and catalyst. Conditions practiced in the slurry reactor included powder catalyst (dp < 150 μm, quick internal diffusion), saturation of the liquid with H2 under pressure, and vigorous stirring of the solution (elimination of the outer layer of liquid on the catalyst particles). Under these conditions, surface reactions with the liquid phase components under weak adsorption and absence of mass transfer resistances were assumed. The apparent reaction rate is represented by ""rX "" as xylose consumption, (1) r X = k a p C X where the apparent reaction rate constant is expressed by, (2) k a p ' = k K X K H 2 P H 2 H H 2 - 1 C X From the reactor mass balance - w c a t r X = V R d C X d t results, (3) - d C X d t = k a p C X where k, KX e KH2 are the reaction and adsorption rate constants of xylose and hydrogen, respectively. For hydrogen there is Henry's constant (HH2 ) and pressure (PH2 ), while CX is the concentration of xylose. The adjustment of the data in Table 3 to the model proposed by the equation allowed us to estimate the reaction rate constants at the three temperatures. These initial values were used for a second adjustment procedure considering both the independent variables time and temperature (t, T), where the effect of temperature was assumed as a result of the application of the Arrhenius equation. Following the adjustments with a correlation coefficient (R2) in the range of 0.9678–0.9835, an activation energy (Arrhenius’ law) was calculated. The adjustment of the data in Table 3 to the model proposed by Eq. (3) allowed to estimate the reaction rate constants at the three temperatures. These initial values were used for a second adjustement procedure considering the both independent variables time and temperature (t, T), where the effect of the temperature was assumed as a result of the application of the Arrhenius equation. Following the adjustments with correlation coefficient (R2) in the range of 0.9678–0.9835 the activation energy (Arrhenius law, k a p = k a p 0 exp - E a t R T - 1 ) was calculated. The estimated activation energy in the order of 40.76 ± 2.64 kJ mol−1, characterized for the temperature range from 80 °C to 120 °C, is significant in terms of the activity of the formulated catalyst, capable of processing the hydrogenation of xylose at similar levels of several of that previously practiced processes (Delgado Arcaño et al., 2020), that revealed energy values in the range of 20.9–53.1 kJ mol−1, with Ru catalysts on different supports (C, Al2O3, CF, HYZ) and Raney nickel catalysts, in the range of 353 K–413 K."
12,Conclusions,"In the search for the development of a low cost and efficient technology for the production of xylitol, it was possible to obtain high amounts of xylose from the biomass subjected to lignin extraction under the evaluated effect of the concentration of sulfuric acid. It was observed that the extraction of lignin from the biomass with H2SO4 2.5% (v/v) resulted in a xylose yield greater than 99% of the total content contained therein. The yielded aqueous solution of extracted xylose was hydrogenated using Ni–Ru/C catalyst formulated with Ni 10.0 wt.% and Ru 1.0 wt.% promoting high conversion (>90%) at low temperatures (80 °C–120 °C) and producing xylitol with high selectivity (>80%). Kinetic evolutions were conducted at 80 °C, 100 °C and 120 °C in a slurry reactor and evaluated based on a pseudo first order mathematical model applied under chemical regime conditions. The experimental results were adjusted in terms of operating time and temperature, providing hydrogenation activation energy values of the order of 40.76 kJ mol−1."
