0,Introduction,"Nowadays, fossil fuels represent the largest source of worldwide energy; however, it is well recognized that the reserves of these fossil fuels are decreasing dramatically. This fact together strictest environmental regulation has led to the research and development of alternative source to replace traditional fossil fuels. The use of biomass as sustainable feedstock is a suitable option for the production of energy and chemicals and with lower greenhouse emissions than fossil fuels [1]. The most abundant and competitive non-fossil carbon source is lignocellulosic biomass which does not interfere in the food chain, as occurred with the first generation of renewable feedstock [2]. Lignocellulose, composed by cellulose (40–50%), lignine (15–25%) and hemicellulose (20–35%), is fragmented by acid hydrolysis to form pentosans and xylans from hemicellulose and cellulose, which can be dehydrated to obtain furfural (FUR) and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) [1,3], two important building blocks for the synthesis of a large spectrum of chemicals and biofuels. FUR is one of the main products obtained from the biomass with a production about 280,000 tons/year [4] due to its high versatility. Itself, furfural displays excellent properties as extractant to remove aromatic compounds from lubricants, additive for the synthesis of cross-linked polymers, nematocide or fungicide [5–7]. The presence of an aldehyde group and conjugated double CC bonds in furfural confers high versatility for the synthesis of other high value-added chemicals, by means of a large variety of reactions, such as decarbonylation, oxidation, acetylation, aldol or Grignard reaction [1,4,8,9], and hydrogenation, ring opening, oxidation or alkylation [1,4,10,11], respectively. In this sense, the hydrogenation of furfural can give rise to linear alkanes, furoic acid, maleic acid, furan, 2-methyl furan (MF), 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran (MTHF), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFOL) and furfuryl alcohol (FOL), among others. The furfural hydrogenation to furfuryl alcohol can be carried out both in gas and liquid phase conditions. The major hurdle limiting the liquid-phase batchwise operation process is the economical unattractiveness for large-scale applications due to its high operating costs, the expensive equipment required for high pressure conditions, and the elapsing time between successive reaction cycles. All these drawbacks can be overcome by using gas phase. Copper chromite catalyst is traditionally used in industrial hydrogenation of furfural; however, the presence of chromium species [12], with a high toxicity and leachable in the reaction medium, makes unsustainable this process. This fact has prompted the development of more sustainable environmentally Cr-free based catalysts as alternative to the industrial catalyst. Thus, it has been reported in the literature the use of Cu [13–25], Ni [21,25,26], Co [21], Pd [23,25], Pt [27,28] or Au [29] as active phase for the hydrogenation of furfural in gas phase. The catalytic activity, mainly the selectivity, of catalysts in FUR hydrogenation is directly related to the hydrogenating capacity of the active phase. Thus, noble metals, such Pd, Pt or Ni, favor the opening of furanic ring leading to hydrocarbons, such as butane and pentane [25,26,30], while catalysts with lower hydrogenating capacity, or larger contact time, give rise to furan, which is also a building block for the synthesis of tetrahydrofuran, pirrol or thiophene [7]. The use of an active phase with even lower hydrogenating capacity, such as Cu, avoids the carbon atom loss during the reaction, leading to furfuryl alcohol and 2-methylfuran, which have a high industrial interest. Thus, FOL is used in the manufacture of foundry resins due to its excellent thermal [31], chemical and mechanical properties, plastics, non-petroleum chemicals pharmaceutical and agrochemical products [1], while MF is a promising biofuel component [1,5,32] although also displays other applications as solvent in the production of chloroquine (antimalarial drug), nitrogen and sulfur heterocycles [1,32,33]. The design of a suitable catalytic system is a challenge in heterogeneous catalysis. In the case of catalysts used in the hydrogenation of furfural, they can be classified in two groups: those that use supports, such as Al2O3, SiO2 [25,26], or mesoporous MCM-41 silica [13], with high thermal, chemical or mechanical stability where the active phase is highly dispersed, and metal nanoparticles (Cu) interacting with metal oxides, such as MgO [15,16] or ZnO [14]. This interaction modifies the electronic density of the metal species, and the formation of nanoparticles favors the availability of a high amount of active sites. It is well recognized that ceria (CeO2) displays a high ability to store and release oxygen by the presence of two kinds of oxygen species: surface oxygen, which is favored for CeO2 with lower particle size, and bulk oxygen, typical of larger particles, which provides interesting properties for oxidation process [34,35]. Nevertheless, the use of Cu/CeO2 catalysts has been previously reported in hydrogenation processes [36–38]. The presence of ceria in copper-based catalytic systems modifies the properties of metal copper particles, favoring the reduction of copper oxide to Cu0 at lower temperatures, as previously reported in the preferential oxidation of CO to CO2 [35,39], by comparing ceria with other supports, such as SiO2 [13], MgO [15] and ZnO [14]. In this sense, the decrease of the reduction temperature is a key factor to obtain small Cu0 particles, thus the sintering effect is minimized, which is also avoided by the strong copper-ceria interaction [36]. Moreover, the relatively low reaction temperature can limit this sintering effect. The present research studies the catalytic activity and stability of Cu/CeO2 catalysts in the furfural hydrogenation in gas phase. In addition, the influence of experimental parameters, such as Cu/Ce molar ratio, reaction temperature and contact time, on the catalytic performance has been also evaluated."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of catalysts,"2.1 Synthesis of catalysts The precursors of Cu/CeO2 catalysts were synthesized using a co-precipitation method from aqueous solutions of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (Aldrich, 99%) and Ce(NO3)4 3H2O (Aldrich, 99%) ​with a total concentration of 0,3M, and the adequate amounts of Cu(II) and Ce(IV) salts to obtain the desired Cu/Ce molar ratios. An aqueous solution of NaOH (0.3M) was slowly added to the copper/cerium solution until pH 11 to precipitate both copper and cerium hydroxides [40,41]. Thereafter, the precipitate was aged at 60°C for 4h, and then at room temperature for 12h. The solid was filtered and washed with water until reach a neutral pH to ensure the removal of Na+ species. Finally, the solid was dried overnight and calcined at 400°C for 1h, with a rate of 2°Cmin−1. The reduction temperature was estimated by taking into account the profile of the H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2 TPR) curves, and it was maintained for 1h in order to ensure the full reduction of copper species. Samples were labeled as Cu-CeO2-x, where x is the Cu/Ce molar ratio."
3,Characterization methods,"2.2 Characterization methods Powder XRD patterns were collected on a X’Pert Pro MPD automated diffractometer (PANalytical B.V.) equipped with a Ge (1 1 1) primary monochromator (strictly monochromatic CuKα1 radiation) and an X’Celerator detector with a step size of 0.017°. Diffractograms were recorded between 10° and 70° in 2θ with a total measuring time of 30min. The particle sizes of CeO2 and Cu° and the lattice strain were estimated by the Williamson-Hall method, using the equation B cosθ=(K λ/D)+(2 ε sin θ), where θ is the Bragg angle, B is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the XRD peaks, K is the Scherrer constant, λ is the wavelength of the X ray and ε the lattice strain [42]. The cell parameters were obtained from Rietveld method by using the XPert HighScore Plus software. Raman spectra were recorded in a Jobin Yvon Horiba Raman dispersive spectrometer with a variable power He-Ne laser source (632.8nm) with an input power of 0.9nm using a 10×objective for every wavelength. The detector is a CDD Peltier-cooled detector. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiments were carried out using 0.080g of catalyst previously treated with a He flow (35mLmin−1) at 100°C for 30min. After cooling to room temperature, the H2 consumption was studied between this temperature and 800°C, by using an Ar/H2 flow (48mLmin−1, 10vol.% of H2) and a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1. Water formed in the reduction process was removed with an isopropanol-liquid nitrogen trap and a cold finger (−80°C). The H2 consumption was measured with an on-line gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-14A) provided with a TCD, and quantified by calibration with pure CuO as reference standard (Aldrich), assuming a total reduction of CuO to Cu0. The carbon content, after the catalytic test, in spent catalysts was determined by elemental analysis with a LECO CHN 932 analyzer. The textural parameters were evaluated from nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms at −196°C, as determined by an automatic ASAP 2020 Micromeritics apparatus. Prior to measurements, samples were outgassed at 200°C and 10−4 mbar overnight. Specific surface areas (SBET) were determined by using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation considering a nitrogen molecule cross section of 16.2Å2. Pore size distribution was determined using the density functional theory (DFT). Metal surface area and dispersion were evaluated by N2O titration [43]. This method is based on the formation of a monolayer of Cu2O by oxidation of superficial Cu0 with a N2O flow, according to the reaction: 2Cu0 +N2O→Cu2O+N2. Before analysis, the CuO phase is reduced under a 10vol.% H2/Ar flow (48mLmin−1) and a rate of 5°Cmin−1, until 220°C for CuCe-x catalysts and 350°C for Cu catalyst, during 1h. Then, samples were purged under a He flow and cooled down to 60°C. The oxidation of Cu0 to Cu+ is carried out by chemisorption of N2O (5vol.% N2O/He) at 60°C during 1h. Later, the catalyst was again purged with an Ar flow and cooled to room temperature. After this, the reduction of Cu2O to metallic Cu was carried out raising the temperature up to the aforementioned values for CuCe-x catalysts (220°C) and freshly oxidized Cu2O (350°C). X-ray photoelectron spectra were performed using a Physical Electronics PHI 5700 spectrometer with non-monochromatic Mg Kα radiation (300W, 15kV, 1253.6eV) with a multi-channel detector. Spectra were recorded in the constant pass energy mode at 29.35eV, using a 720μm diameter analysis area. Charge referencing was measured against adventitious carbon (C 1s at 284.8eV). A PHI ACCESS ESCA-V6.0F software package was used for acquisition and data analysis. A Shirley-type background was subtracted from the signals. All recorded spectra were always fitted using Gaussian-Lorentzian curves to more accurately determine the binding energy of the different element core levels. Both fresh and spent catalysts were stored in sealed vials with an inert solvent. The sample preparation was done in a dry box under a N2 flow, where the solvent was evaporated prior to its introduction into the analysis chamber, and directly analysed without previous treatment. The error in BE was estimated to be ca. 0.1eV. A short acquisition time of 10min was used to examine Ce 3d and Cu LMM XPS regions in order to avoid, as much as possible, photoreduction of Cu+ and Ce4+ species. Nevertheless, a partial reduction in high vacuum during the analysis cannot be excluded [44]."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test The vapor-phase hydrogenation of furfural was performed in a tubular quartz reactor with an internal diameter of 6.35mm (¼”), by putting the pelletized catalyst (325–400μm) at the center of the reactor tube, between two layers of glass beads and quartz wool and controlled by a thermocouple in direct contact with the catalyst bed. Prior to the catalytic test, catalysts were reduced in situ under a H2 flow (60mLmin−1, Air Liquide, 99.99%) for 1h at 573K. After reduction, catalysts were cooled down to the selected reaction temperature under a H2 flow (10mLmin−1). When this temperature was reached, a flow of 3.87mLh−1 of a furfural (Sigma-Aldrich) solution in cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME) (Sigma-Aldrich) (5vol.%) was continuously injected by using a HPLC pump. CPME is an environmentally friendly solvent that has been used in different organic reactions, thus demonstrating to be a green co-solvent for the selective dehydration of lignocellulosic pentoses to furfural [45]. The reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-14A) equipped with a Flame Ionization Detector and a CP-Wax 52CB capillary column. The furfural conversion and selectivity were calculated and defined as follows: Conversion ( % ) = mol of furfural converted mol of furfural fed × 100 Selectivity ( % ) = mol of the product mol of furfural converted × 100 The turnover frequency was calculated: TOF = − ln ( 1 − X ) ( W/F ) · M where F is the molar rate of furfural (molh−1), W is the catalyst weight (g), X is the conversion and M is the mole of sites loaded (molg−1). This formula was used because conversions were close to 100% so were far from differential conditions, and an integral analysis was needed. This equation, in which −ln(1−X) substitutes for X assumes a pseudo first-order reaction which may be justified by the excess of hydrogen [46]."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of catalysts Powder XRD patterns of catalyst precursors exhibit in all cases, except for the bulk Cu precursor, broad diffraction peaks located at 2θ=28.5, 33.4, 47.5, 56.5, 59.2 and 61.6°, which can be assigned to CeO2 with a cubic fluorite-type structure (PDF 00-034-0394) (Fig. 1 A). These signals, as expected, become wider and less intense as the copper content increases. In addition, precursors with higher copper content (Cu-CeO2-2.5, Cu-CeO2-6 and Cu) also display additional bands located at 2θ=32.5, 35.5, 38.7, 48.8, 53.5, 58.3, 61.6, 66.2 and 68.1°, associated to the presence of crystalline CuO (monoclinic tenorite, PDF 00-048-1548). The average crystal size of ceria, estimated by the Williamson-Hall equation [42], is very small in all cases, diminishing from 11.9to 3.9nm with the copper content. This fact can be explained by the increasing strain due to the presence of a higher amount of grain boundaries, as consequence of the small crystal size. Concerning the crystallite size of CuO, the Williamson-Hall equation cannot be resolved for Cu-CeO2-0.2 and Cu-CeO2-0.4 precursors; nonetheless, it can be observed that CuO crystal size is directly related to the amount of copper content incorporated, increasing from 6nm for Cu-CeO2-0.2 to 41nm for Cu precursor. The crystal size of CeO2 and CuO confirm that a suitable dispersion of copper species is attained by using a co-precipitation method in the presence of CeO2. The cell parameters and the quantification of each crystalline phase of the catalytic precursors were determined by Rietveld method (Table 1 ). The lattice parameters of the CeO2 reveals that the addition of copper species seems to affect the CeO2 and CuO lattice parameters (Fig. 2 A), being the catalyst with a Cu/Ce molar ratio of 1 that with the highest deformation in their lattice parameters. This fact suggests that a small proportion of copper oxide species are incorporated into the ceria framework during the synthetic procedure. For this purpose, the Cu-CeO2-1 catalyst synthesized by coprecipitation method was compared with another sample with Cu/Ce=1 molar ratio which was synthesized using CeO2 as support with the incorporation of copper by incipient wetness volume and subsequent calcination (Cu-CeO2-1-i). This catalyst exhibits a CeO2 and CuO crystal sizes larger than those of the catalyst synthesized by the coprecipitation method. The sample synthesized by the impregnation method shows that both ceria and copper oxide maintain the lattice parameters of pure CeO2 and CuO, so the incorporation of copper species into the ceria must be discarded. In this sense, it is reported in the literature that the insertion of hydrogen as H− in several oxides, as CeO2, favors the insertion of cations such as Cu2+ or Ni2+ [47], similarly to was shown for other transition metals. This fact can lead to the formation of oxygen vacancies located in the Cu-CeO2 interface [48], the generation of different hydrogen species envisaged [49], or the modification of metal-Ce4+ interaction [50] that modifies the interaction between Cu and CeO2 [51]. On the other hand, it is noteworthy the agreement between the weight fraction of each crystalline phase determined by the Rietveld method and those used in the synthesis step for Ce and Cu precursors. Raman spectroscopy was employed to corroborate the insertion of copper into the ceria lattice (Fig. 2B). The Raman spectrum of the CeO2 exhibits a main band located at 462cm−1, which is assigned to the F2g vibrational mode of the cubic fluorite-type structure of cerianite. In addition, weaker bands are observed at 610cm−1, associated to oxygen vacancies in the ceria lattice, and 245cm−1, assigned to the displacement of oxygen atoms from their ideal fluorite lattice positions [52,53]. The incorporation of copper down shifts the wavenumber values due to the formation of a small proportion of CuO that shields ceria [35]. It is well known that the shift of Raman spectra is directly related to the modification in the lattice parameters. Thus, a comparison between Cu-CeO2-1 and Cu-CeO2-1-i catalysts reveals that, though both catalysts have different lattice parameters, the F2g vibrational mode is similar. This fact suggests that copper has not been inserted in the ceria framework, but rather the bulky ceria cell is more susceptible to suffer small distortion due its smaller particle size [54]. The appropriate reduction temperature of precursors has been determined from the corresponding H2-TPR curves (Fig. 3 ). In the case of CeO2 (Fig. 3A), it has been previously reported that the reduction process occurs in two stages: i) starting from 225°C with a maximum at 350°C, is attributed to the reduction of Ce coordinately unsaturated located on the surface which is favored for ceria with smaller particle size and ii) at temperatures above 600°C, H2 consumption is attributed to the bulk CeO2 species which requires higher temperatures to be transported to the surface before the reduction [35,39]. In the case of bulk CuO (Fig. 3B), the reduction process takes place in one step, with a maximum at 254°C, whereas the low H2 consumption located about 185°C would suggest the existence of a fraction of small copper particles. The formation of a CuO-CeO2 system improves the redox behavior of copper species due to the oxygen mobility generated by the ceria promotes spillover process in interfacial sites of CuO-CeO2 [55,56]. Thus, Fig. 3B reveals that higher ceria content favors the reducibility of copper species. H2-TPR curves can be decomposed in three contributions: i) at lower temperature, denoted as α peak, is attributed to the reduction process of isolated CuO species that interacts with the CeO2, ii) the second contribution (β peak) is assigned to highly dispersed CuO species in close contact with CeO2, and iii) at higher temperature (γ peak), it is assigned to bulk copper species (Table 2 ) [55]. H2-TPR profiles show that γ peak is majority in all catalysts, except in the case of Cu-CeO2-0.2 sample, which has the lowest copper content leading to a smaller particle size and a higher dispersion of Cu0. The H2 consumption values are slightly higher than the theoretical ones, which would indicate the overlapping between the reduction process of copper species and the formation of hydrogen spillover species on the surface of the ceria [39]. According to the reduction temperature shown in the H2-TPR profiles, a temperature of 250°C was considered to reduce the Cu-CeO2-x precursors, while a temperature of 300°C was chosen for Cu precursor and CeO2, maintaining this temperature for 1h in all cases to ensure the complete reduction of the precursors. After the reduction step, the XRD study of fresh catalysts (Fig. 1B) reveals that diffraction peaks associated to ceria lead to similar average crystal size and strain than those observed in the precursors, which confirms the stability of ceria during the reduction process. Moreover, it can be ruled out the presence of diffraction signals attributed to CuO, corroborating its complete reduction, concomitantly with the appearance of new diffraction peaks located about 2θ=43.4 and 50.5°, that are assigned to metallic copper (PDF 00-004-0836). Average particle sizes of Cu0 crystals are similar to those found for CuO particles in the corresponding precursors, except in the case of bulk Cu catalyst, where sintering takes place during the reduction process. This behavior points that ceria favors the dispersion of copper species. Concerning the lattice parameters of both CeO2 and Cu0, it can be observed a similar pattern than their respective precursors, inasmuch as the distortion of the lattice parameters is maintained after reduction, mainly for Cu-CeO2-1 catalyst (Fig. 2A). The textural parameters of Cu-CeO2-x catalysts were determined by N2 adsorption-desorption at −196°C (Fig. 4 ). According to the IUPAC classification, CeO2 catalyst displays a type IV isotherm, typical of mesoporous material; however, the addition of copper changes the isotherms to type II, characteristics of macroporous materials (Fig. 4A). All catalysts display hysteresis loop of H3 type, which suggests the presence of slit porous originated from layered aggregates [57]. BET surface area values decrease from 115.2 until 50.3m2 g−1 (Table 3 ), as the CuO content increases [43]. The pore size distribution, estimated by the DFT method (Fig. 4B), shows the absence of micropores, being attributed the porosity to the interparticular space, which is favored for smaller copper particles. The increase of copper content gives rise to larger copper particles, as can be inferred from XRD data (Fig. 1B), which provokes a decrease of interparticular voids and consequently of the SBET values. This fact is confirmed by the DFT method (Fig. 4B), since CeO2 exhibits a relatively homogeneous pore size distribution with a maximum about 8.5nm, which confirms the mesoporosity. The incorporation of copper leads to a more heterogeneous pore size distribution. The quantification of the Cu0 species exposed on the surface of catalysts was carried out by N2O titration (Table 3). The metal surface and dispersion depend on the copper content, varying from 18.9mCu 2 g−1 for Cu-CeO2-0.2 to 10.6m2 Cu g−1 for Cu-CeO2-6 catalyst. The metal surface decays until values close to 0.7m2 Cu g−1 for bulk Cu. In order to evaluate the superficial composition and oxidation state of chemical elements located on the surface, XPS measurements were carried out. Table 4 compiles the Ce 3d 5/2 and Cu 2p 3/2 binding energy values and the superficial Cu/Ce molar ratio of catalysts. Cu 2p core level spectra display three contributions (Fig. 5 A). The first one, located at lower binding energy (932.0–932.5eV), is attributed to reduced copper species. The small contribution between 934.3 and 934.6eV can be assigned to Cu2+ species, which would indicate the presence of unreduced copper species, due to the reduction temperature is very close to the total reduction observed in the H2-TPR curves, or the reoxidation of the copper species favored by the presence of CeO2, and/or the superficial oxidation of the copper by the contact with the air contact during the manipulation of the samples. Finally, the third contribution (940–945eV) is associated to the typical shake-up satellite which is characteristic of divalent species such as Cu2+ [58]. The percentage of reduced copper species was estimated from the Cured/CuO ratio. In all catalysts, this ratio varies between 2.22 and ∞, indicating that the reduced copper species are majority, mainly for the catalysts with higher copper content. This is confirmed by determining the ratio between the satellite peak and the main peak (ISat/Imain). From the Cu 2p 3/2 signal, it is not possible discern between the Cu0 and Cu+ oxidation states, being necessary the Auger CuLMM signal to distinguish between both copper species (Fig. 5B). The broad band can be deconvoluted in two contributions located at 919.0eV and 916.0eV which indicates the existence of Cu0 and Cu+ species, respectively. Ce 3d core level spectra (Fig. 5C) can be deconvoluted in six contributions v, u (Ce 3d 9 4f 2 O 2p 4) and v”, u” (Ce 3d 94f 1 O 2p 5): v”’, u”’ (final state of Ce 3d 94f 0 O 2p 6) assigned to that Ce4+ 3d final states and four contributions v 0, u 0 (Ce 3d 9 4f 2 O 2p 5) and v’, u’ (Ce 3d 9 4f 1 O 2p 6) assigned to Ce3+ as a consequence of the hybridization between the Ce 4 levels and the O 2p states, thus reveling that both Ce3+ and Ce4+ species are present in all catalysts [59]. The profile of the Ce 3d core level spectra shows the coexistence of Ce3+ and Ce4+. The Ce3+/Ce4+ molar ratio is in the range of 0.19–0.31, indicating that Ce4+ is the main oxidation state, although the H2 treatment and the low particle size of ceria favor the reduction of coordinately unsaturated surface capping oxygen ions (Fig. 3B) [39]. Finally, the surface Cu/Ce molar ratios, estimated by XPS, are close to the theoretical values for the catalysts with low copper content. However, these are lower for higher copper loadings due to the sintering of copper species during the calcination and the reduction steps, while CeO2 maintains its small particle size, as inferred from XRD data (Fig. 1B)."
7,Catalytic tests,"3.2 Catalytic tests Cu-CeO2-x catalysts, synthesized by the coprecipitation method, have been evaluated in the hydrogenation of furfural in gas phase, at atmospheric pressure, by using a solution of FUR in cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME), a solvent with favourable properties such as a low boiling point (106°C), relative stability under acid and basic conditions, low formation of peroxides and low solubility in water in comparison with other ethereal solvents [60]. In a preliminary test, CPME was fed without furfural to ensure that this solvent is inert under the experimental conditions used in furfural hydrogenation. Thereafter, the stability of the Cu-CeO2-x catalysts was evaluated at 190°C for 5h on time-on-stream (TOS) with a furfural fed of 5%vol. (Fig. 6 ). This study has demonstrated that Cu-CeO2-x catalysts are more active than pure Cu and CeO2, which confirms the synergic effect between Cu0 and CeO2. In this sense, previous research has pointed out that the interaction between metal Cu0 and basic or amphoteric oxides, such as CaO, ZnO or MgO [14–17] has a beneficial effect on the catalytic performance of Cu-based catalysts in the hydrogenation of furfural, probably due to the modification of the electronic density of the active phase. In the presence of CeO2, the high oxygen mobility favors the reducibility of the catalytic system, diminishing the reduction temperature of precursors. Moreover, the amphoteric character of ceria, which modifies the electronic density of metal copper, together with the small particle size and high dispersion of both CeO2 and Cu0 synthesized the coprecipitation method, lead to very active catalysts for furfural hydrogenation. From Fig. 6A, it can be deduced that initial conversion values of Cu-CeO2-x catalysts are close to 100%, and then catalysts undergo deactivation with TOS, which is more pronounced for the catalyst with lower Cu/Ce molar ratio, obtaining a furfural conversion of 55% after 5h of TOS for Cu-CeO2-0.2 and Cu-CeO2-0.4 catalysts. However, catalysts with higher Cu/Ce molar ratio seem to be more resistant against deactivation, maintaining the Cu-CeO2-6 catalyst a conversion of 83% after 5h. These results reveal that catalysts with smaller metal particle sizes deactivate faster due to their higher initial activity in furfural hydrogenation (Table 3). Regarding the reaction products, previous research on furfural hydrogenation has demonstrated that catalysts with low hydrogenating capacity, such as copper, favor the formation of products that do not involve the cleavage of CC bonds, mainly furfuryl alcohol (FOL), 2-methylfuran (MF), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFOL) and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF), depending on the experimental conditions [4,14,15,25]. In the present work, only FOL and MF were detected. In all cases, the selectivity to FOL increases with TOS (Fig. 6B), which can be explained by considering that the deactivation mainly affects to the more active hydrogenation sites, which could be favored by the presence of water generated in the conversion of furfural or furfuryl alcohol to 2-methylfuran. This evolution of FOL selectivity together with a high resistance to deactivation of catalysts with higher copper contents gives rise to an increase of FOL yield with TOS. Thus, the highest FOL yield (67%) is obtained for the Cu-CeO2-6 catalyst, whereas catalysts with the lowest Cu/Ce molar ratio, Cu-CeO2-0.2 and Cu-CeO2-0.4, originate FOL yields below 50%, after 5h at 190°C. Therefore, this catalytic behavior could be explained by the existence of two types of active sites: more hydrogenating centers leading to the hydrogenation of FUR to MF and another favoring the formation of FOL, with a lower hydrogenating capacity, being the former more susceptible to deactivation by the formation of carbonaceous deposits [61]. However, other explanation would involve the existence of a single type of metal sites on which takes place the consecutive reactions of FUR→FOL→MF, where deactivation by sintering and/or deposition of carbonaceous deposits avoids the FOL→MF reaction [62]. The evolution of turnover frequency (TOF) values (Fig. 7 ) reveals that the catalyst with the lowest copper content, i.e., Cu-CeO2-0.2, displays the lowest value, 48.9h−1 after 1h TOS, decreasing to 26.6h−1 after 5h. An increase of the copper content leads to a progressive raise of TOF values, which can be explained by the decrease of the dispersion degree of copper species, thus decreasing the metal copper surface area, as well as the higher conversion values. Thus, after 5h, the Cu-CeO2 catalyst with the highest copper content, i.e., Cu-CeO2-6, reaches a maximum TOF value of 105.3h−1. The diffractograms of spent catalysts reveal an increase of metal particle sizes for CeO2, and mainly for Cu0, (Table 1), being more noticeable for Cu-CeO2-0.2 and Cu-CeO2-0.4 catalysts. In this sense, H2-TPR profiles showed that catalysts with lower copper content are more easily reducible (Fig. 3B), causing the sintering of metal particles, which decreases the amount of available Cu0 sites. XPS study of spent catalysts (Table 4) has demonstrated that copper species do not suffer clear modifications in its oxidation state. Thus, copper is mainly in its reduced form, coexisting Cu0 and Cu+ species on the catalyst surface, although the Cu+ contribution increases with respect to fresh catalysts (Table 4); however, this species was not detected by XRD. This fact could be attributed to XPS is a surface characterization technique, which only allows to study the first 3–4nm of the outer region of particles. With regard to the cerium species, the surface Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio is maintained after the catalytic test, which confirms the high stability of ceria, as was suggested in the XRD study (Fig. 8 A and Table 1). The surface Cu/C molar ratio of spent catalysts are lower, which could be explained by the presence of carbonaceous deposits. The formation of these deposits is more pronounced for the catalysts with higher copper content, although their high metal surface area makes to these catalysts more resistant to the deactivation process. In this sense, it has been reported in the literature that the organic feedstock are adsorbed strongly at relatively lower temperatures, as takes place in the furfural hydrogenation, causing the deactivation of the sites [63]. According to these catalytic results, the Cu-CeO2-6 catalyst, which has shown the highest FUR conversion and more resistance against deactivation, has been chosen to evaluate the influence of different experimental parameters on FUR hydrogenation. Firstly, the influence of the reaction temperature was evaluated in the range of 170–210°C (Fig. 9 ). The catalytic results demonstrate that the FUR conversion increases directly with the reaction temperature due to its endothermic character, being thermodynamically favored at higher reaction temperatures [24]. Thus, FUR conversion rises from 21 to 83% by increasing the reaction temperature from 170 to 210°C, after 5h TOS. Several authors have pointed out that a higher reaction temperature favors the polymerization of FUR and the generation of higher amount of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface, thus decreasing FUR conversion and MF yields [14,62]. In the present work, it has not been observed the typical volcano shape due to the maximum reaction temperature used in this work was 210°C. The use of a reaction temperature close to the reduction temperature (250°C) would result in the sintering of metal copper species, with the concomitant loss of metal surface centers and the generation of carbonaceous deposits which leads to a worse catalytic behavior. In all cases, both FOL and MF were the only detected reaction products. From Fig. 9B–C, it can be highlighted that the MF yield increases directly with the temperature, being the main product at the beginning of the reaction; nonetheless, this product decreases with TOS, reaching values of 4.3 and 43% at 170 and 210°C, respectively, after 5h TOS. The decrease of the MF along the reaction is accompanied by an improvement of the FOL yield, reaching a maximum FOL yield of 67% after 5h TOS when the reaction occurs at 190°C. This fact corroborates that the formation of MF provokes the fast deactivation of the active sites responsible of its formation, as previously noted. The diffractograms of spent catalysts at different reaction temperatures (Fig. 8B) show that all samples display similar diffraction patterns after the catalytic tests, maintaining the Cu° crystal size between 50 and 57nm, so the sintering of the active Cu0 species by the modification of the reaction temperature can be discarded. In this sense, the small particle size and high stability of the CeO2 play a key role in the dispersion of the Cu0 crystals, avoiding the sintering of the active sites. With regards to the XPS of the used catalysts (Fig. 10 ), both Cu 2p and Ce 3d core level spectra maintain their contributions with similar proportions to those shown before the catalytic test, which confirms the high stability of the Cu-CeO2-6 catalyst. However, the Cu/Ce molar ratio slightly decreases from 1.06 for the fresh catalyst to 0.92 for used catalyst at 210°C as well as Cu/C molar ratio also suffers a clear decrease. This fact suggests the formation of carbonaceous deposits on the surface of the catalyst, and more specifically on the Cu0 particles, inasmuch as Cu0 crystal size is maintained after the catalytic test, while Cu/Ce molar ratio decreases progressively (Table 4). The H2 flow was also varied (Fig. 11 ), and the catalytic data show that FUR conversion is barely modified with the time on stream for low H2 flow (10mLmin−1); however, the use of a higher H2 flow (60mLmin−1) leads to lower FUR conversion. Thus, a lower H2 flow involves a higher contact time, i.e., more FUR molecules are available to be adsorbed on active sites, being favored the consecutive reactions FUL→FOL→MF, and the opposite is found for higher H2 flow (lower contact time) leading to lower MF yields. The influence of the furfural fed was analyzed in the furfural hydrogenation for Cu-CeO2-6 catalyst (Fig. 12 ). Catalytic data show that the use of higher furfural content provokes a slight decrease in the catalytic conversion. However, yields towards MF and FOL are strongly affected. Thus, the use higher furfural content in the feed provokes a decreasing of the MF yield, which is accompanied with an increasing of the FOL with the time of stream due to the deactivation of the hydrogenating sites evolved in the MF obtaining. Finally, the influence of Cu0 crystal size on the catalytic activity was also evaluated (Fig. 13 ). For this purpose, Cu-CeO2-1 and Cu-CeO2-1-i samples, which display different CeO2 and Cu° crystal sizes (Table 1), were tested in FUR hydrogenation. The catalytic results show that Cu-CeO2-1 catalyst is more active and stable than Cu-CeO2-1-i due to its lower particle sizes, which could point out the existence of a higher metallic surface, i.e., higher amount of available sites, favoring the formation of MF. However MF yield tends to diminish with TOS, which provokes an increasing of the FOL yield. In the case of Cu-CeO2-1-i sample, the larger crystal sizes provoke a decrease of the amount of available sites, entailing this catalyst is undergone to higher deactivation process as can be observed after 5h TOS."
8,Conclusions,"A series of Cu-CeO2-x catalysts with Cu/Ce molar ratio in the range of 0.2–6.0, synthesized by the coprecipitation method, has been tested in the gas-phase hydrogenation of furfural. They exhibit a high dispersion of the active phase, as can be inferred from their high metal surface. All catalysts have shown an excellent catalytic behavior and high stability due to the strong metal-ceria interaction, which modifies the electronic density of the active copper species, reaching a furfural conversion of 83% with the best catalyst (Cu-CeO2-6) after 5h TOS at 190°C. FOL and MF were the only detected products, being MF the main product at short reaction times, while FOL yield increase for longer, which can be explained by the formation of carbonaceous deposits on the highly hydrogenating sites, and the oxidation of the active phase by water generated in the hydrogenolysis of FOL to MF. The analysis of spent catalysts also reveals that the average crystal sizes of both CeO2 and Cu0 are similar to those of fresh catalysts, thus confirming the high stability of these species under the experimental conditions employed in the catalytic process, mainly for catalysts with higher copper content, so the deactivation by sintering can be ruled out."
