0,Introduction,"The family of zinc-containing, medium chain alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) includes enzymes with diverse activities and amino acid sequences, but usually very similar three dimensional structures [1–5]. The catalytic zinc in ADHs binds the alcohol and promotes the deprotonation of the hydroxyl group and facilitates hydrogen transfer, as based on structural studies, pH dependencies and chemical principles [6–8]. In dimeric horse liver and human ADHs, and in tetrameric yeast and other ADHs, the catalytic zinc is ligated to two cysteine residues and one histidine residue, and an oxygen from a water, substrate, or a glutamate to form a tetrahedral coordination [9–21]. Sequence alignments and three dimensional structures show that the three residues ligated to the zinc are conserved in dimeric vertebrate ADHs, but one cysteine (equivalent to Cys-153 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ADH1) may be substituted with an aspartic acid residue in some related dehydrogenases [2,5,22–28]. The enzymes with the aspartate generally are more active with secondary alcohols and ketones than with primary alcohols and aldehydes as compared to the enzymes with cysteine [29]. ADHs from Thermoanaerobium brockii and Alcaligenes eutrophus prefer isopropanol, 2-butanol, or 2,3-butanediol over primary alcohols [30,31]. Threonine dehydrogenase also acts on a secondary alcohol [32]. Some enzymes have a glutamate residue instead of cysteine (~153), often with a deletion of the preceding adjacent residue. Butanediol dehydrogenase from S. cerevisiae has Glu-175 and best activity on 2,3-butanediol [33]. Sorbitol dehydrogenases (SDH) are homologous to the classic alcohol dehydrogenases [2,34]. Diols and polyols are better substrates for these enzymes, as fructose, sorbitol, and 2,3-butanediol are good substrates for SDH [35]. Rat, human and Bemisia argentifolii SDHs have Glu-155 (or 152), which appears to bind to the zinc in the rat enzyme, but not in the other enzymes, and instead is suggested to act as a base to activate a water bound to zinc [36–38]. The apoenzymes have the alternative coordination where Glu-70 (or 67) is ligated to the catalytic zinc in a distorted tetrahedral or octahedral coordination, and is displaced when a substrate analogue binds to form a pentacoordinated zinc, as shown in the human enzyme [38]. The E155C substitution in the rat enzyme decreased catalytic efficiency by 110-fold even though turnover increased 4-fold [39]. The E154C substitution in the yeast Galactocandida mastotermitis xylitol dehydrogenase decreased catalytic efficiency on sorbitol by 5200-fold, turnover by 140-fold at pH 9, and shifted pH profiles upward with pK values from 7.4 to 9.1, consistent with a mechanism that involves base catalysis [40]. The glucose dehydrogenase from Haloferax mediterranei has Glu-64 and Glu-150 ligated to the zinc in binary complexes with NADPH, but Glu-150 binds to the zinc-bound water in ternary complexes with glucose or gluconolactone [41]. In contrast, glucose dehydrogenase from Sulfolobus sofataricus has Gln-150 that binds to a water that is bound to the catalytic zinc [42]. As noted above, the coordination of the catalytic zinc varies dynamically in the dehydrogenases and their complexes. Of particular relevance for the present study, a glutamate residue (Glu-67 in yeast ADH1), following the conserved His-66, binds the zinc in the apoenzymes and is displaced by the oxygen of the substrate with inversion of the configuration of the zinc in the ternary complexes with coenzyme [14–17,43]. This alternative coordination was first discovered in some subunits of dimeric human ADH3 (χχ, glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase) and subsequently in the tetrameric ethanol-inducible E. coli ADH and yeast ADH1 [15,18,44]. The inversion of the coordination might provide a mechanism for exchange of water with a substrate oxygen as shown in Scheme 1 [13,15,43–46]. The change in coordination essentially occurs by movement of the zinc by ~2.6 Å and small movements of the side chains of the glutamate, cysteine and histidine residues. In addition to the defined alternative positions in some structures, X-ray crystallography indicates that the zinc is mobile because the electron density is elongated or shows approximately bipyramidal coordination [14,27,44,46,47]. Calculations showed that it is energetically feasible for the zinc coordination to switch [45]. It appears that Glu-67 is displaced from the zinc in ternary complexes that have a bound substrate analogue, except for the glucose dehydrogenases discussed above where the sugar does not bind to the zinc, but rather to a water bound to the zinc. A catalytic role for Glu-67 in yeast ADH1 and human ADH3 is supported because substitutions with neutral residues severely decrease enzyme activity [47,48]. The general conclusion from the structural studies is that the zinc is mobile and the coordination is flexible. The zinc participates directly in the catalysis of hydrogen transfer by binding the oxygen of the substrate, or perhaps to a water that interacts with the substrate. Extensive studies with the horse liver ADH suggest that the pK of the water bound to the zinc in apoenzyme is shifted significantly by binding of the nicotinamide rings of NAD+ and NADH near to the zinc [8,49]. The pH dependence of the enzymes kinetics is controlled by the pK values of water and ligands bound to the zinc, while His-51 in the protein relay system in ternary complexes also participates in acid/base catalysis; see Scheme 2 [8,50,51]. The ligands and the local environment modulate the potential of the zinc to polarize the C-O bond of the substrate, and changing a ligand to the zinc could affect the substrate specificity, catalytic activity and pH dependencies. Some studies on zinc ligands have been done, as noted above, but substituting Cys-153 with an aspartic acid residue in an ADH needs to be done in the context where other amino acids are the same as in wild-type enzyme. Substrate specificities might show more activity with secondary alcohols and diols. Structures, kinetics and mechanisms have been studied in yeast ADH1 as a foundation for this work [15,52–54]. Several dehydrogenases with substitutions of the homologous cysteine have also been studied."
1,Experimental procedures,
2,Site-directed mutagenesis,"2.1 Site-directed mutagenesis A single stranded template derived from the gene for ADH1 in the yeast shuttle vector, YEp13 [55], was mutated with the oligonucleotide 5′-C CCC ATC TTG GAT GCT GGT ATC-3' (where the underline shows the changes in coding from Cys to Asp) with standard methods [56,57]. The substitution was confirmed by the loss of a FokI restriction site and by sequencing the DNA. The SphI fragment was subcloned into the YEP13 plasmid and transfected into E. coli XL1-Blue cells for production of the plasmid that was then transfected into an ADH-negative strain of S. cerevisiae with selection for growth without leucine and production of the substituted C153D ADH [53,58]."
3,Enzyme purification,"2.2 Enzyme purification Yeast were grown to full density (OD600 = 12) at 30 °C in 6 1.5-L flasks of YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose), with vigorous shaking. The enzyme was purified by precipitation with protamine sulfate and PEG4000 and chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B and Octyl-Sepharose CL-4B, except that EDTA was not added to the buffers [53]. (The half-life of the purified C153D enzyme in the buffers generally used in the purification of ADH1 (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mM EDTA) was less than 35 min. The enzyme activity was completely lost on the Octyl-Sepharose column when the standard buffer system (1 M ammonium sulfate in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mM EDTA) was used. In 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) without EDTA, the final enzyme preparation was reasonably stable (t½ > 30 days) at 4C. The final enzyme preparations appeared to free of other proteins by SDS and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. From 120 g wet yeast cells, about 30 mg of enzyme was obtained with a 16-fold purification. The concentration of purified protein was estimated using A280 = 1.26 cm−1 (mg/ml)−1. The concentration of active sites was determined by spectrophotometric titration with NAD+ in the presence of 100 mM pyrazole [59]. The turnover numbers (V/E t, s−1) were calculated from the enzyme subunit concentrations and controlled by the activity in a standard assay [60]. Relative to the concentration of protein subunits determined by A280, 55% of the subunits could bind NAD+ and pyrazole."
4,Steady-state kinetics,"2.3 Steady-state kinetics A physiological buffer of 83 mM potassium phosphate and 40 mM KCl, pH 7.3, was used for the kinetics experiments [61]. Enzyme activity was determined by measuring the change in absorbance at 340 nm with a spectrophotometer at 30 °C, with a FORTRAN program to estimate initial velocities with a linear or parabolic fit of the data. The concentrations of substrates were varied in a 10-fold range around the corresponding K m values. The data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation with the HYPER program [62]. The kinetic constants for the sequential bi mechanism were determined by initial velocity studies with concentrations of both substrates varied in a systematic manner (5 × 5 matrix) and fitting the data to Eq. (1) with the SEQUEN program, where concentrations of reactants (A = NAD+, B = alcohol) are given in brackets, and the kinetic constants for the respective substrates have the corresponding subscripts. For the reverse reaction, P = aldehyde is substituted for B, and Q = NADH is substituted for A [63]. Data from the initial velocity patterns for dead-end inhibitors were fitted to Eq. (2) with the COMP program. Standard errors for kinetic constants were usually <10–20% of the values, indicating good estimates. (1) v = V 1[A][B]/(K ia K b + K a[B] + K b[A] +1) (2) v = V 1[B]/(K b(1 + [I]/K d) + [B]) Primary kinetic isotope effects were determined with a fixed concentration of 2 mM NAD+ with the concentrations of protio and ethanol-d 5 varied over a 10-fold range up to 150 mM."
5,pH dependence,"2.4 pH dependence The kinetic constants were determined at 30 °C by initial velocity studies with concentrations of ethanol varied from 15 to 150 mM and 2 mM NAD+. Buffers of 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate and 0.25 mM EDTA containing sufficient sodium phosphate to produce a final ionic strength of 0.1 and the desired pH were used [54]. The buffers in the pH range of 5.5–9.0 were prepared by mixing stock solutions of pH 5.5 and 9.5 in the appropriate ratios. The buffers with pH over 9.0 were prepared from stock solutions of pH 9.4 and 10.7 that contained 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.25 mM EDTA, and 5 mM sodium carbonate for good buffering capacity. All buffers were made as double strength and diluted in the reaction mixture with substrates and NAD+ just before the assay was started. The pH did not change significantly after the enzyme reaction. The pK values for the pH dependencies were determined by fitting the kinetic constants with a nonlinear least-squares program (NONLIN, C. M. Metzler, The Upjohn Co.) to equations derived for various mechanisms."
6,Results,
7,Steady-state kinetics,"3.1 Steady-state kinetics The oxidation of ethanol and reduction of acetaldehyde showed intersecting initial velocity patterns, indicative of a sequential bi mechanism (Fig. 1 ). Table 1 shows that the overall kinetic constants were similar to those for wild-type enzyme, except for the turnover number for oxidation of ethanol (7-fold slower) and Michaelis constant for acetaldehyde, K p (9-fold higher). Catalytic efficiencies, as defined by V 1/E t K b and V 2/E t K p, are decreased 18- and 8-fold respectively, indicating that the binding of substrate to the enzyme-coenzyme complex, hydride transfer, or product release (or some combination of steps) have been significantly affected by the C153D substitution. Trifluoroethanol and pyrazole are competitive inhibitors against ethanol for the C153D enzyme, just as for ADH1. Trifluoroethanol, an inactive analogue of ethanol, probably binds zinc as the alkoxide. The 5-fold lower affinity for trifluoroethanol (1/K d) compared to the value for the wild-type enzyme might suggest that the zinc is more negatively-charged because it is ligated to a carboxylate (pK of 4.1 [64]) rather than to a cysteine thiolate (microscopic pK of 10.0 [65], with bond distances of 2.4–2.7 Å to the zinc determined by X-ray crystallography [15]). The enzyme-NAD+-pyrazole complex might resemble a transition-state structure [59,66], and the 65-fold lower affinity of the C153D enzyme for pyrazole might suggest changes in this structure. However, the UV difference spectrum showed peaks at 286 and 292 nm due to the NAD-pyrazole complex, as for wild-type yeast enzyme. Alterations of the electrostatic charge on the zinc, local structure or ligand exchange equilibria could decrease affinities for trifluoroethanol and pyrazole. Primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects on V 1/E t and V 1/E t K b with ethanol at pH 7.3 were determined to be 3.0 ± 0.4 and 3.8 ± 0.5 respectively. The large isotope effect on V 1/E t, relative to the value for wild-type enzyme (1.8 ± 0.1 [54]) suggests that hydride transfer has become more rate-limiting for the overall turnover. The isotope effect on V 1/E t K b for wild-type enzyme is 3.2 ± 0.2, which shows that hydride transfer is at least partially rate-limiting the reaction of the enzyme-NAD+ complex with ethanol to form and release acetaldehyde for both enzymes."
8,Substrate specificities,"3.2 Substrate specificities Turnover numbers and catalytic efficiencies (V 1/E t and V 1/E t K m) for the C153D enzyme acting on primary alcohols decreased as the chain length of the alcohol increased, with patterns similar to those for wild-type enzyme, but with the absolute values uniformly decreased about 40-fold (Table 2 ). Lower turnover numbers are responsible for the lower efficiencies, whereas K m values were similar to those for the wild-type enzyme. The overall pattern reflects the constricted substrate binding site of the yeast enzyme [15]. The C153D substitution decreased activity on the secondary alcohols only 4–5-fold as compared to wild-type ADH1 (Table 2). The values of V/E t K m for 1,2-propanediol and acetone were similar to those for the wild-type and mutant enzymes. These changes would be consistent with a somewhat altered binding site near the catalytic zinc, because of the additional atoms in Asp-153. Nevertheless, the relatively small magnitudes of the effects suggest that Asp-153 does not contribute significantly to the specificity for these alcohols. Additional substitutions in the substrate binding site seem to be required to accommodate secondary alcohols, diols and branched chain alcohols [67]."
9,pH dependence,"3.3 pH dependence A different electrostatic environment at the zinc could shift pK values for catalysis due to changes in the ability of the zinc to polarize the substrate [48]. The zinc may be more negatively-charged in the C153D enzyme because of the substitution of the thiolate by the carboxylate. The pH dependencies for the V 1/E t and V 1/E t K b kinetic parameters for ethanol oxidation are shown in Fig. 2 . The pH profiles are similar for the wild-type and C153D enzymes, but differ in the pK values and limiting rate constants (Table 3 ). The pK value of 7.6 for V 1/E t was higher than the value of 7.3 for wild-type enzyme, but the maximum rate for wild-type enzyme is 3-fold higher at high pH and the minimum value at low pH is 38-fold higher (Table 2). For wild-type enzyme, the relatively small pH dependence (3-fold difference between high and low pH) reflects the rate of dissociation of NADH, which mostly controls turnover [52,54]. The larger pH dependence for the C153D enzyme (36-fold difference for the limiting rate constants) arises because hydride transfer has become more rate-limiting step for turnover. The pH dependence for V 1/E t K b for both wild-type and C153D enzymes reflects the hydride transfer step (based on the significant deuterium isotope effects) and shows a similar dependence over the pH range of 6–9. The fitting of pH dependencies shows that the C153D substitution changes the pK values and limiting rates, reflecting some differences in the enzymes (Table 3). Nevertheless, it is significant that the C153D and wild-type enzymes have similar patterns of pH dependence over the middle of the pH range, although the C153D enzyme is ~12-fold less active than the wild-type enzyme. The interpretation of the pH dependence for V 1/E t K b is complicated for alcohol dehydrogenases. In principle, pK values reflect protonation states of the forms of the enzyme-NAD+ complex that bind and oxidize alcohol, and release the product aldehyde. Groups on the yeast enzyme that could directly participate include His-48, which can act through a proton relay system with the oxygen of a water or the alcohol bound to the zinc [15,68]. Substitution of His-48 with a glutamine residue in yeast ADH1 decreases activity about 10-fold and alters the pH dependence [69]. Substitution of the homologous His-51 in horse liver ADH (see Scheme 2) also decreases activity and changes the pH dependence [50]. A proton is released, apparently from the zinc-water, when NAD+ binds to the horse liver enzyme [51]. However, the zinc in yeast ADH1 is coordinated in different ways in the open conformation of the enzyme-NAD+ complex and the closed enzyme-NAD+-alcohol complex as shown in Scheme 1 [43]. It appears that the C153D substitution did not directly alter the pK values of the ionizable groups (His-48 or zinc-bound water or alcohol), but did affect the participation of the zinc in activating the substrates for hydride transfer or the conformational changes in the local structures that are involved in the binding of the alcohol. The C153D substitution seems to affect the reactions of both the alcohol and the aldehyde similarly because the catalytic efficiencies are decreased by ~13-fold. The enzyme accommodates an aspartic acid without a large effect on catalysis."
10,Discussion,
11,How does the C153D substitution affect yeast ADH structure and catalysis?,"4.1 How does the C153D substitution affect yeast ADH structure and catalysis? Alignments of the amino acid sequences of medium chain alcohol dehydrogenases show that Cys-43 and His-66 (yeast numbering) are highly conserved in the family, whereas Cys-153 is substituted with Asp or Glu in some enzymes that act on threonine or sorbitol [22]. The substitution of a sulfhydryl group with a carboxyl group could change the substrate specificity and affect the ability of the catalytic zinc to bind and polarize the substrate. Changing Cys-153 in the yeast enzyme to aspartic acid permits us to assess the quantitative contribution of this residue in the context of the constellation of the other amino acid residues in the structure. The C153D enzyme was not very stable during purification by the usual procedure, because EDTA seemed to remove the zinc. However, the modest changes in most kinetic constants suggest that the C153D substitution is accommodated with small changes in the structure that do not seriously affect the stability of the protein when EDTA is not in the buffers. Model building supports the conclusion that one carboxylate oxygen can bind to the catalytic zinc (although without adjustments, that oxygen is in close contact with the imidazole group of His-66), while the second oxygen would be close to the substrate analogue, trifluoroethanol (Fig. 3 ). The model building suggests that Asp-153 is firmly stabilized with the other carboxylate oxygen interacting with Thr-157 OG1 and a water molecule that forms hydrogen bonds with Trp-92 N and another water. This position would seem to preclude a direct catalytic role for Asp-153, but local rearrangements in structure cannot be predicted. In contrast, the human ADH1B with the C174E substitution was not stable, perhaps because of steric conflicts due to the larger size of a glutamate residue [70]. Some small changes in structure are to be expected for the C153D substitution. For example, the substitution of the zinc ligand His-94 with cysteine in human carbonic anhydrase II shifted the peptide backbone by 0.5 Å near the changed ligand [71]. In general, the kinetic parameters for the C153D enzyme acting on ethanol and acetaldehyde were similar to those for the wild-type enzyme (Table 1), suggesting that aspartate can replace Cys-153 conservatively. Effects on binding of coenzymes were modest although the affinity for NAD+ (1/K ia) was increased 3-fold. Catalytic efficiencies for both ethanol oxidation and acetaldehyde reduction were decreased about an order of magnitude, which might indicate that the catalytic role of the zinc has been affected. However, the magnitude of V 1/E t K b is mostly just decreased over the pH range, suggesting that the contribution of the zinc in facilitating deprotonation of the alcohol is not changed. In contrast, the H48Q or H48E substitutions of His-48 in the proton relay system connected to the alcohol oxygen [15] or the D49 N or E67Q substitutions near the catalytic zinc decrease activity and shift the shapes of the pH dependencies [72]. For both wild-type and the C153D enzymes, the formal charge on the zinc (II) is zero, as the cysteines and aspartate residues are deprotonated, but the different pK values (4.1 and 10.0) for the aspartate and cysteine side chains could affect the overall effective charge on the zinc and its ability to polarize the substrates. For the well-studied horse liver ADH1E the zinc-water apparently has a pK of about 9.2–9.5, which shifts to about 7.3 when NAD+ binds, probably due to the proximity of the positively-charged nicotinamide ring [51,73,74]. Transient kinetic studies of the oxidation of ethanol and benzyl alcohol show that the enzyme-NAD+-alcohol complex has a pK value of about 6.4 [75,76]. Solvent isotope effects and X-ray crystallography show that alcohols form a low-barrier hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Ser-48 with a partial charge on the alcohol in the transition state of −0.3 [77–79]. These studies suggest that the zinc and its environment are critical factors in decreasing the pK value of the alcohol from a value near 16 and facilitating hydride transfer. However, the C153D substitution does not seem to affect the participation of the zinc in the deprotonation of the alcohol. It has been argued that the catalytic zinc in ADH does not strongly polarize the substrates (Lewis acid effect) because of the ligation to two negatively-charged amino acids. The polarization of the zinc is moderated by the ligation and is optimized for the physiological function of oxidizing alcohols. Changing the polarization would affect the energetics of the ternary complex interconversion and favor alcohol oxidation or aldehyde reduction [80]. Because the catalytic efficiencies for both ethanol oxidation and acetaldehyde reduction are decreased by similar factors, it appears that polarization of the substrates by the zinc has not been affected by the C153D substitution. The increase in the isotope effect for ethanol oxidation by the C153D enzyme can result from a decrease in the commitment to catalysis due to isomerizations in the central complex, such as changes in zinc coordination or changes in the ground state structure due to small structural changes. One possible explanation for the changed isotope effects and the ~10-fold decrease in catalytic efficiencies is that the exchange of ligands on the zinc is affected. As shown in Fig. 3, the C153D substitution probably would change the local structure of the ternary complex in order to relieve some steric conflicts, but as shown in Fig. 4 , the structure of the open conformation of the apoenzyme can accommodate the C153D substitution without steric conflict because the zinc is in a different position and is ligated to Glu-67. Thus, the C153D substitution could alter the energetics of the substitution of the zinc-water with substrate by favoring the alternative coordination of the zinc with Glu-67 (see Scheme 1). Substituting Glu-67 with glutamine decreased catalytic efficiencies by 100-fold, which now can be explained by the X-ray structures as resulting from the effects on the zinc coordination of the apoenzyme [15,43,48]. Nevertheless, small changes in the ground state structures of the ternary complexes with substrates could also affect the isotope effects and catalytic efficiencies of the C153D enzyme. With respect to the idea that the C153D substitution could make the enzyme more active on secondary alcohols and diols, the modest changes in catalytic efficiency (<5-fold) show that the C153D substitution alone is not sufficient. The patterns of catalytic efficiencies on primary alcohols for wild-type and C153D enzymes decrease similarly with increasing chain length of the alcohol, suggesting that the overall substrate binding site has only been moderately affected by the C153D substitution. The active site of wild-type enzyme has very little space to accommodate secondary alcohols or diols (see Fig. 4 in Ref. [15]). Yeast ADH1 has more restricted substrate specificity than vertebrate ADHs [67,81–85]. Because substrate specificities of the yeast and liver enzymes can be significantly altered by substitutions of other amino acid residues in the substrate binding sites [53,67,86], the C153D and additional substitutions might lead to enhanced activity on secondary alcohols."
12,Analysis of mechanisms of homologous ADHs with substitutions of cysteines ligated to the catalytic zinc,"4.2 Analysis of mechanisms of homologous ADHs with substitutions of cysteines ligated to the catalytic zinc The overall goal of this study was to determine how Asp-153 (or its homologous substitutions) might participate in catalysis by ADHs. We used the Dali server [5] to align the three-dimensional structures of members of this family and examined the residues that interact with the catalytic zinc in each enzyme (Table 4 ). Furthermore, we identified amino acid residues that are homologous to the residues observed in the structures and by site-directed mutagenesis to participate in a hydrogen bond system that can serve as a relay to accept a proton from the zinc-bound alcohol or to donate a proton to aldehyde during reduction: Thr-45 and His-48 [72]. The corresponding residues are Ser-48 and His-51 in horse liver ADH (see Scheme 2 [50,86]). The alignments show that comparable residues are found in all of these enzymes, which may have common mechanisms. The analysis of the structures shows that these enzymes are clearly related, even though the sequence identities among them are low. Among the ligands to the catalytic zinc, Cys-43 is present in 11 of the 12 enzymes, with Asp-38 substituting in the Haloferax mediterranei glucose dehydrogenase [41]. His-66 is conserved in all of the enzymes. Glu-67 is conserved in all of the enzymes, but in most structures, its carboxyl group is not directly ligated to the zinc, but rather is in the second coordination sphere (indicated by the parentheses in the table) and poised to ligate the zinc as a potential intermediate in the mechanism of exchange of alcohol for a water [43,87]. The residue corresponding to Cys-153 in yeast ADH or Cys-174 in horse ADH is replaced by aspartate in five of the enzymes or by a glutamate in five or by a glutamine in one. The fourth ligand to zinc is often a water molecule, or an oxygen of an inhibitor or substrate analogue. Unfortunately, most of the structures do not have a good substrate analogue bound even if most of them have bound coenzyme, and one must build models to illustrate how a substrate might bind. One significant substrate analogue is the 2-hydroxymethylpyrimidine inhibitor that binds as one might expect sorbitol to bind to a sorbitol dehydrogenase and forms a pentacoordinated zinc [38]. The zinc in horse liver ADH can also form pentacoordinated zinc with the chelating inhibitors 2,2′-bipyridine or 1,10-phenanthroline in the absence of coenzyme, but is typically tetracoordinated in apoenzyme and ternary complexes with coenzyme and substrate analogues [46]. Among those enzymes with bound coenzyme and a substrate analogue is the ADH from Aeropyrum pernix (1H2B.pdb, 28% sequence identity to yeast ADH), which has one carboxylate oxygen of Asp-168 bound to the catalytic zinc and its other oxygen 2.5 Å away from one carboxylate oxygen of bound endogenous (co-purified) octanoate that has its other oxygen ligated to the zinc [24]. This octanoate oxygen is also hydrogen bonded toThr-56 OG1, which is linked to the nicotinamide ribose O2D of NAD and then to the imidazole group of His-59, similar to the ternary complex of yeast ADH (Ref. [15], Fig. 3). Thus, this complex appears to be a good model for the yeast C153D enzyme and indicates how Asp-153 could be accommodated in the structure. Modeling suggests that the methyl group of a bound secondary alcohol could replace one oxygen of the octanoate. However, it is not clear how one oxygen of the aspartic acid could interact with a methyl group of a secondary alcohol or with an oxygen of octanoate. Intriguingly, the octanoate may be formed by oxidation of the gem-diol form of octanaldehyde (RCH(OH)2), where one oxygen is bound to the zinc and the other interacts with a carboxylate oxygen of Asp-168. Thus, this enzyme may have increased potential to oxidize aldehydes to acids, a well-documented, but slow, activity of several ADHs [84,88–94]. Another related enzyme, from Rhodococcus ruber (with 29% sequence identity to yeast ADH), formed ternary complexes with NAD and 1,4-butanediol or acetate (from the crystallization medium) with one oxygen ligated to the zinc [25]. The structure with the diol (2XAA.pdb; B, C, D subunits) resembles yeast ADH with bound trifluoroethanol, and the Asp-153 carboxylate oxygens interact with the zinc and Thr-157 OG1, but not with the diol. The structure with acetate (3JV7.pdb) has one oxygen bound to the zinc and the other oxygen extending down into the substrate binding site, with the methyl group nestled toward the indole ring of Trp-295. Modeling of a structure with 2-octanone shows that the methyl group could fit near Trp-95 and explain the stereospecificity of the reaction to form the S-2-alcohol, as determined for the best substrate, 1-phenethylethanol [29]. In this structure, also, it appears that Asp-153 would not be in position to participate in acid/base catalysis. In both structures, Ser-40 could participate in a proton relay where the OG hydroxyl group could interact with a butanediol hydroxyl group and relay a proton to the NAD O2D hydroxyl group, but residue 43 is phenylalanine, rather than the histidine that is found in the yeast enzyme. Alternatively, His-39 (which interacts with a phosphate oxygen of NAD in the structure) might swing into a position with its ND1 hydrogen bonded to NAD O2D and transfer a proton from the alcohol through the relay system. A role for His-39 is indicated because the H39 N substitution decreased apparent k cat/K m values with NAD+ or S-1-phenylethanol by ~3–16-fold [29]. Structures of the carbonyl reductase from Candida parapsilous (30% identical to yeast ADH) provide additional interesting information about zinc ligation and substrate specificity. In subunit B (4C4O.pdb, with NAD, but no substrate analogue), the catalytic zinc occupies two positions, with Glu-66 or water forming the alternative coordination with Cys-44 and His-65, and Asp-154 able to bind to either position of the zinc [27]. Because wild-type yeast ADH also has two positions for the zinc (see Scheme 1), it appears that the C153D substitution would be compatible with the change in coordination. Modeling of subunits A and B of the yeast enzyme with Asp-153 suggests the zinc could readily move (compare Figs. 3 and 4). The substrate stereoselectivity of C. parapsilous ADH was inverted by the F285A and W286A substitutions, and a structure of a binary complex with substrate could be determined, but no ternary complex has been studied [95]. The H49A enzyme was weakly active, and forms a binary complex with a substrate, suggesting a catalytic role for His-49. The Thermus sp. ATN1 ADH (24% identity with horse ADH1E) was crystallized as a binary complex with NADH bound to subunits A, C, and D, and it has a water bound to the catalytic zinc in the position that would be occupied by a substrate oxygen [28]. This enzyme acts well on primary and secondary alcohols, and, interestingly, catalyzes the dismutase reaction of aldehydes [96]. A more distantly related ADH that binds the coenzyme tightly, the formaldehyde dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida, also catalyzes a dismutase reaction and has Asp-169 substituted for a cysteine; another structure (1KOL.pdb) has bound NAD, and a water bound to the zinc [97]. Further kinetic studies are required to determine if the enzymes with the aspartate residue are better catalysts for aldehyde oxidation by NAD+ (dismutase reaction) than the enzymes with cysteine residues. The studies on the NADP-dependent ADHs from Clostridium beijerinckii and Thermoanaerobacter brockii (16% identity to yeast ADH1) provide various structures that show that Cys-37, His-59, and Asp-150 are bound to the zinc, while Glu-60 can bind to the zinc in some subunits [26]. Although no structures are available for a ternary complex with substrates, spectroscopic studies of transient reactions led to the suggestion that a pentacoordinate species with Glu-60 and a water formed as an intermediate [98]. The E60A substitution decreased enzymatic activity to 25%, suggesting that Glu-60 has some role in catalysis [99]. For comparison, the conservative C37S, H59Q, and D150C substitutions in T. brockii ADH decreased catalytic efficiencies to 17, 66, and 5%, respectively, of the values for wild-type enzyme, suggesting that the zinc ligands are important [100]. Residues that could participate in base catalysis through the proton relay, Ser-39 and His-42, are present, but not in contact with the coenzyme in the observed protein conformation. Although the sequence alignment of E. coli threonine dehydrogenase (27% identical to yeast ADH1) appears to have Asp-147 replacing the cysteine, no X-ray structure is available. However, the enzyme from Thermus thermophilis has Glu-148 at the corresponding position, but not ligated to the zinc and with a gap of the preceding residue in the sequence alignment (2EJV.pdb, unpublished). NAD is bound, but no substrate analogue is present to assess a role for Glu-148 in catalysis. The sorbitol dehydrogenases also have a glutamate residue at the position corresponding to Cys-153, and it is ligated to the zinc in the rat enzyme complexed with NAD [36], but not in the apoenzymes from Bemisia argentifolii [37] or the sheep enzyme [101] or various forms of the human enzyme [38]. Glu-67 (or 70) is ligated to the zinc except in ternary complexes. The E155C substitution in the rat enzyme decreases catalytic efficiency by 110-fold [39], and the E154C substitution in the yeast Galactocandida mastotermitis xylitol dehydrogenase decreases catalytic efficiency by 5000-fold [40]. A significant ternary complex was obtained for the human enzyme with the 2-hydroxymethylpyrimidine inhibitor that binds in the substrate binding site and forms a pentacoordinate complex with the zinc [38]. The carboxyl group of Glu-155 interacts with the primary hydroxyl group of the inhibitor and a zinc-bound water, which also interacts with Glu-70. This structure provides a basis for an enzyme mechanism where it is proposed that a water bound to a pentacoordinated zinc and interacting with Glu-70 and Glu-155 deprotonates the C2-OH of sorbitol before transfer of the C2-H to the nicotinamide ring. Another mechanism proposes that a tetracoordinated zinc with Glu-154 interacting with the C1-OH and a zinc-bound water has Glu-70 acting to relay the proton from the C2-OH via the water to solvent [40]. However, inspection of the structure and the model with fructose presented in Fig. 6A of Ref. [38] supports another proposed mechanism where Glu-155 binds the C1-OH, and the Ser-46 OG accepts the proton from C2-OH, which is ligated to the zinc [34]. The Ser-OG hydroxyl group could also bind to the 2′-OH of the nicotinamide ribose, which could relay the proton to His-49. The structure of the sheep liver enzyme has no coenzyme bound, but does have acetate near the zinc, interacting with a zinc-bound water and the carboxyl group of Glu-155, which is not ligated to the zinc. Thus, in these sorbitol dehydrogenases, the glutamate homologous to Cys-153 might or might not bind to the zinc. Structures of additional complexes are needed to clarify the mechanism. The structure of glucose dehydrogenase from Thermoplasma acidophilum (21% identity to yeast ADH1) has Glu-155 in place of the cysteine residue [102]. The structure of the enzyme complexed with NADP+ from Haloferax mediterranei also has Glu-150 ligated to the zinc, as well as His-63, Glu-64 and a water, but Asp-38 (substituting for another cysteine) is in the second sphere of ligation [41]. Interestingly, when glucose is soaked into the crystals with NADP+, the zinc coordination changes so that Asp-38, His-63, O1 and O2 of glucose, and a water are bound to the pentacoordinated zinc. The water binds to carboxyl oxygens of both Glu-64 and Glu-150. In an abortive complex (with a substrate and a product) formed by soaking the E-NADP+ crystals with gluconolactone, the oxygens of the lactone are in the second sphere of the zinc, which is tetracoordinated with Asp-38, His-63, Glu-64 and a water. On the basis of these structures, the authors suggest that the “textbook MDR (medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase) mechanism requires modification,” and they propose that somehow the water bound to the zinc and to the carboxylates of Glu-64 and Glu-150 accepts the proton from glucose and the “need for a proton-relay system to the solvent” first proposed by Eklund et al. [68] “is replaced by a simpler solution.” However, the complex with NADP+ and glucose should represent a ternary enzyme substrate (or product) complex, and the X-ray structure shows that O1 of the glucose is ligated to the zinc and hydrogen bonded to Thr-40 OG2, which in turn is hydrogen bonded to the 2′-OH of the nicotinamide ribose of the NADP. This structural element is found in structures for both horse and yeast ADHs [15,79], and a role in catalysis is supported by substitutions of Thr-45 in yeast ADH, Ser-48 in horse liver ADH, Thr-48 in human ADH1B, and Thr-41 in Sulfolobus sofataricus glucose dehydrogenase to alanine residues with loss of activity [42,72,86,103]. The glucose dehydrogenase is different than the ADHs, however, because the histidine (residue 51 in horse ADH) acting as the distal base [50] is replaced by Glu-43, which would not be as effective in catalysis as judged by experiments with yeast ADH1 [72]. A simpler mechanism would have Glu-150 in glucose dehydrogenase binding to O2 of the substrate and O1 binding to the zinc and linked to the proton relay system as C1 is oxidized. The complex of glucose dehydrogenase from S. sofataricus with NADP has a tetracoordinated zinc with Cys-39, His-66, Glu-67 and a water, which is hydrogen bonded to Gln-150. Significantly, in the ternary complex of the T41A enzyme with NADP and glucose, O1 is not ligated to the zinc, perhaps because the Thr-41 OG2 is not present to stabilize the interaction. Gln-150 OE1 interacts with the zinc-bound water, while Gln-150 NE2 interacts with O2 of the glucose, supporting a role in substrate recognition rather than in acid-base catalysis."
13,Conclusions,"The highly-conserved zinc ligand, Cys-153 in yeast ADH1, can be substituted with an aspartic acid residue with only modest, but some significant, changes in the enzyme kinetics, apparently because the structural changes are small. Catalytic efficiencies are decreased 8–18-fold for reactions of ethanol and acetaldehyde, but the pattern of substrate specificities for a series of primary alcohols is relatively unchanged, suggesting that the extended substrate binding site is not affected by the C153D substitution. The pH dependence for ethanol oxidation is similar to that of wild-type enzyme, but hydride transfer is partially rate limiting for catalysis. It appears that electrostatic effects and polarization by the zinc are not altered by the C153D substitution, but rather that the exchange of ligands on the zinc (substrate for water) has been affected. This conclusion fits with the X-ray structures of wild-type enzyme that show different states of zinc coordination in apoenzyme and holoenzyme conformations (Scheme 1). Some homologous zinc-dependent medium chain alcohol dehydrogenases have the aspartate substitution and some changes in substrate specificity accompanied by various substitutions of amino acid residues in the substrate binding pocket. Inspection of structural models and kinetic data suggest that the dismutation of aldehydes (oxidation of aldehyde to acid coupled to reduction of aldehyde to alcohol) could be promoted by interaction of an aspartate carboxylate oxygen with an oxygen of the gem-diol intermediate. Sorbitol and glucose dehydrogenases have the glutamate substitution, for which a role in acid-base catalysis has been proposed. However, the crystallographic evidence actually supports a role for the glutamate in binding the hydroxyl group adjacent to the one that is bound to the catalytic zinc and is oxidized to a carbonyl group. A role in binding seems more likely because the glutamate is substituted with glutamine in a glucose dehydrogenase. Most of these medium chain dehydrogenases have at least a “cryptic” proton relay system that includes a Ser/Thr hydroxyl group interacting with the oxygen of the substrate bound to the zinc and the 2′-OH of the nicotinamide ribose of NAD(P), which in turn can interact with a histidine residue acting as a base (Scheme 2). The diversity of structures of these medium-chain dehydrogenases, with different coordination of the zincs, suggests that the catalytic mechanisms might be different, but convincing evidence is lacking. The structures and mechanisms of these enzymes need further studies of relevant ternary complexes, quantitative analysis of contributions of certain amino acid residues to catalysis, and kinetics to establish the determinants of substrate specificity and the catalytic mechanisms."
