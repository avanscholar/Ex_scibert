0,Introduction,"Growing interest in hydrogen as an energy carrier of the future is in contrast to the fact that at present, most of hydrogen produced worldwide comes from thermo-chemical conversion of fossil fuels (Wukovits et al., 2012). As a result of numerous studies on alternative production systems, it is now widely recognized that similar to bioethanol or biomethane, hydrogen can be sustainably produced by biological conversion of carbohydrate-containing biomass (Azbar and Levin, 2012). Among promising methods of biomass conversion to hydrogen, two-stage bacterial fermentation, that is, dark fermentation followed by photofermentation has attracted much attention (Claassen et al., 2009). Dark fermentation consists in converting simple sugars or disaccharides to hydrogen, carbon dioxide and organic acids. Suitable heterotrophic bacteria include strict anaerobes (such as Clostridia and thermophiles), facultative anaerobes (like Enterobacter and E. coli) and aerobes (for example Alcaligenes and Bacillus). Anaerobic bacteria produce hydrogen from hexoses in acetic acid, butyric acid and acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentations. The maximal theoretical value of 4 mol H2/mol glucose can be reached in acetic acid fermentations. When other organic acids and alcohols are produced by facultative anaerobic bacteria, the yield of hydrogen is decreased to about 2 mol H2/mol hexose. The hydrogen yields and production rates of thermophilic bacteria (e.g., Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus and Thermotoga neapolitana) growing at temperatures above 60 °C, are often higher than those of mesophilic bacteria growing at ambient temperature because thermophilic bacteria produce acetic acid as the main fermentation byproduct. Photofermentation consists in reducing substrates to H2 and carbon dioxide. In photofermentation hydrogen can be produced under anaerobic conditions by a wide variety of photoheterotrophic bacteria. These organisms use light for energy and organic compounds such as carbohydrates and organic acids as a carbon source. As examples, one can name purple non-sulfur bacteria including Rhodobacteraceae, which can also grow aerobically in the dark e.g. Rhodobacter capsulatus or Rhodobacter sphaeroides, alternatively Rhodospirillaceae, e.g. Rhodospirillum rubrum which is a facultative anaerobe. Assuming acetic acid as the carbon source, the maximum theoretical hydrogen yield is 4 mol H2/mol acetic acid. The suitability of various types of biomass for fermentative processing to hydrogen depends on their chemical composition (Urbaniec and Grabarczyk, 2009). Sucrose-containing vegetable material can easily be transformed into fermentable feedstock while for starchy biomass or lignocellulosic materials appropriate pretreatment processes are required (Panagiotopoulos et al., 2009). It is also known that protein content in the biomass correlates inversely with the hydrogen yield of dark fermentation (Trably, 2012). On the basis of multi-criterion evaluation of various feedstocks and taking economic factors into account, it can be concluded that sugar beet is one of the best raw materials for fermentative hydrogen production from the technological point of view (Panagiotopoulos et al., 2010) and also taking economic and other factors into account (Diamantopoulou et al., 2011). As sucrose is fermentable, solutions obtained from sugar beet can be directly fed to thermophilic fermentation and their important advantage is the presence of chemical compounds like amino acids and other organic acids which are nutrients for the growth of microorganism cells. Moreover – contrary to lignocellulosic feedstocks – these solutions do not contain any chemicals which might inhibit bacterial growth and hydrogen production in the two fermentation steps. Building on a generally positive operating experience of bioethanol plants integrated with existing sugar factories in Germany (Keil et al., 2009) and in the UK (British Sugar, 2010), the integration of hydrogen production with beet sugar production can be considered (Grabarczyk et al., 2011). It is worth noting that the theoretical energy yield of two-stage hydrogen fermentation per unit mass of a fermentable compound is higher than that of ethanol fermentation. Assuming that sucrose is fermented, the stoichiometric equations of two-stage hydrogen fermentation are following: (1) C12H22O11 + 5H2O → 4CH3COOH + 8H2 + 4CO2 (2) 4CH3COOH + 8H2O → 16H2 + 8CO2 As can be seen in Eq. (1) and (2), 1 mol of sucrose makes it possible to obtain 24 mol of hydrogen. This compares to ethanol fermentation: (3) C12H22O11 + H2O → 2C6H12O6 (4) 2C6H12O6 → 4C2H5OH + 4CO2 According to Eq. (3) and (4), by fermenting 1 mol of sucrose, 4 mol of ethanol can be obtained. Using the above data, the theoretical energy yields of both fermentation routes can be calculated as shown in Table 1 . Taking LHV as basis for comparison, by combusting hydrogen obtained from 1 kg of sucrose, 17% more heat is released in comparison to that released from the combustion of the corresponding amount of ethanol (24% more heat if HHV is taken as a basis). Although the theoretical results cannot be extrapolated to industrial conditions where the reaction efficiencies always are less than 100% and can be different for the different reactions, the prospect of increased energy yield of two-stage hydrogen fermentation as compared with that of ethanol fermentation deserves a closer investigation. In the present paper, the issues of processing technical sucrose solutions, that is, raw juice, thick juice and molasses to hydrogen in a plant connected with a beet sugar factory are reviewed. The costs of H2 production from molasses are estimated and their structure is assessed. No study of this kind has previously been published. It is worth mentioning that the costs of fermentative hydrogen production from potato processing waste, in a stand-alone plant, were evaluated in a paper published by Ljunggren and Zacchi (2010)."
1,Description of the process,"A block diagram of the two-stage fermentative hydrogen production from technical sucrose solutions delivered from a sugar plant is shown in Fig. 1 (Grabarczyk et al., 2011). The feedstock is first diluted with water to the required concentration of substrate and supplied to the dark fermentation where under influence of thermophilic bacteria, sucrose is converted to hydrogen, carbon dioxide and acetic acid. To keep a high hydrogen yield, a temperature of about 70 °C and pressure below 50 kPa are maintained in the bioreactor. The liquid effluent of the thermophilic fermentation, containing acetic acid, is cooled down to 35 °C, diluted and sent to the photofermentation. In the photobioreactor under influence of sunlight acetic acid is reduced by photo-heterotrophic bacteria to hydrogen and carbon dioxide. As long as both fermentation stages are in operation, parts of the effluent stream discharged from the photofermentation are recycled to dilute the fermentation broths (dashed lines in Fig. 1). However, at night-time the photofermentation does not work so it is necessary to collect the effluent from the first stage in a storage tank; this leads also to water and energy management problems that have previously been studied by Foglia et al. (2010) and are discussed in Section 4 below. The optimum pH of the fermentation broths in thermophilic fermentation and photofermentation are 6.5 and 7.3 respectively, and therefore additional chemicals like potassium hydroxide and phosphates are required to set the pH on a suitable level. In order to reduce the heat demand of the process, the thermophilic fermentation and photofermentation are heat-integrated (Markowski et al., 2009). The effluent discharged from thermophilic fermentation is cooled down in a heat exchanger by the external recycle stream or by make-up water needed to dilute the inflowing sucrose solution. The gas mixture obtained from bioreactors is supplied to a gas upgrading unit. Its function is to separate hydrogen from carbon dioxide. Various separation technologies are commercially available for this purpose. Engineering assumptions needed for carrying out the present study were completed taking advantage of the fact that the process outlined above was investigated in the research project titled “Non-thermal production of pure hydrogen from biomass – HYVOLUTION” which was carried out under EU 6th Framework Programme in the period 2006–2010 (Claassen et al., 2010). In that project, it was found that the optimum bioreactor design for the dark fermentation is one combining moving-bed and trickling-bed operation. For the photofermentation, two modular designs of the bioreactor were tested, one employing modules made of low-density polyethylene tubes and another one in which modules were composed of flat panels with transparent plastic walls. Furthermore gas-upgrading technology options were studied and their characteristics were evaluated from the point of view of potential applications in hydrogen production plants based on the fermentative conversion of biomass. It was found that vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) employing carbon dioxide adsorption on molecular sieve is a good choice for low investment, small-scale plants. On the basis of fermentation experiments carried out by HYVOLUTION participants, the processing suitability of selected feedstocks was evaluated. Regarding technical sucrose solutions, it came as no surprise that molasses was found to be superior to beet juices because since the beginning of sugar production from sugar beet, it has been known for its suitability for ethanol fermentation and later also for citric acid fermentation and yeast production. As it contains both fermentable sugars and nutrients, molasses is suited for hydrogen fermentation as well. A part of HYVOLUTION experimental programme was devoted to the use of molasses as a feedstock for thermophilic fermentation (Panagiotopoulos et al., 2010), and another part – to the use of the resulting effluent as a feedstock for photofermentation as explained by Özgür et al. (2010). More experimental results on photofermentation are reported by Özkan et al. (2012). However, neither the over-all performance nor the economic characteristics of the two-stage hydrogen production in industrial-scale with molasses as a feedstock was studied in HYVOLUTION."
2,Process modelling and costing,"A mathematical model was developed and implemented in Microsoft Excel to simulate the process and calculate the specific cost of hydrogen production k H (€/kg). It is understood as the sum of annual costs of capital K c, operation K o, raw material K rm and labor K l (all the annual costs in €/a), divided by the annual hydrogen output: (5) k H = ( K c + K o + K rm + K l ) / ( m H · τ ) where m H denotes plant otput (kg/h) and τ – annual operating time (h/a). As a basis for the determination of capital cost, the purchase prices of the necessary land and process equipment were chosen. These two factors are interrelated because the land area is determined by the design of the photobioreactor which also is decisive in determining the purchase price of the bioreactor. Schemes of key parts of the production plant were elaborated taking both process requirements and reliability issues into account thus making it possible to specify the equipment needed and realistically estimate the equipment costs. A scheme of the dark fermentation part of the plant including two bioreactors operated in parallel is shown in Fig. 2 , and a scheme of the photofermentation part including a modular photobioreactor is shown in Fig. 3 . The gas upgrading unit including three absorbers for the VSA process is schematically shown in Fig. 4 . In all these simplified schemes storage tanks and reserve pumps are not shown but their costs were taken into account. The simulation results and mainly mass and energy balances of the production process were used to size process equipment pieces and to estimate their purchase prices. Regarding such equipment pieces as pressure vessels, thermophilic bioreactors, pumps, compressors, air cooler and shell-and-tube heat exchangers, the purchase prices were estimated from the equation: (6) C eq = C B ( Q / Q B ) M where C eq denotes purchase price of the equipment piece with capacity Q, C B − known base purchase price of the equipment piece with capacity Q B, and M − constant characteristic of the equipment type considered. In addition to shell-and-tube heat exchangers, the application of plate heat exchangers was foreseen. Their purchase prices were calculated depending on the heat transfer area A: (7) C PHE = A · D + E where D, E − constants characteristic of the type of plate heat exchanger (standard or wide-gap design, gasketed or welded). The values of base purchase prices C B and constants D and E were obtained from a friendly engineering company (Polska, 2011) whereas the values of constant M for various types of equipment were adopted after Smith (2005). In order to estimate the purchase price of the photobioreactor, it was necessary to carry out a design study. Taking the constraints associated with the broth flow and hydrogen separation into account, the photobioreactor was assumed to consist of an array of tubular modules. A single module includes two headers, a bank of LDPE tubes having a combined illuminated area of 380 m2 and working volume of 15 m3, and piping for broth inlet/outlet and hydrogen discharge The purchase price of one module was estimated at 5200 €. The required number of modules was calculated after estimating the required size of the photobioreactor. A special feature of the photobioreactor is the short life time of LDPE tubes which require replacement once a year. The fixed capital investment is equal to the sum of the land price C L and the total purchase price of all equipment pieces ΣC eq multiplied by the Lang factor F L ; consequently, the annual capital cost was determined by dividing the fixed capital investment by the plant lifetime Τ: (8) K c = ( C L + ∑ C eq ) · F L / T For the reference, plant lifetime T = 15 years and Lang factor F L = 3 were assumed. The operating cost was assumed to include the costs of maintenance K m, chemicals K ch, steam K s, power K p and cooling water K cw needed to keep the production process running: (9) K o = K m + K ch + K s + K p + K cw The annual maintenance cost of the plant excluding its photofermentation part was calculated by multiplying the annual capital cost by a factor of 0.1; it was added to the maintenance cost of photofermentation, assumed to be equal to the cost of annual replacement of LDPE tubes. The costs of chemicals, steam, power and cooling water were estimated on the basis of process simulation results. The obtained values of annual demand for these media were multiplied by their prices (HYVOLUTION Deliverable 5.30, 2010; Polska, 2011) shown in Table 2 . Using the same approach, the cost of raw material (molasses) K rm was calculated. The labor cost K l was calculated assuming that three skilled workers can operate the hydrogen plant and that 24 man-hours of unskilled workers are needed to replace LDPE tubes in one photobioreactor module."
3,Parametric study and its results,"A parametric study of the costs of hydrogen production from molasses for three cases named Base, Update and Optimistic, was carried out. The values of process parameters are summarized in Table 3 . In the Base case, the values of process parameters correspond to the state of knowledge before the start of HYVOLUTION project (Markowski et al., 2009; Foglia et al., 2010). The Update case is concerned with the results of research on two-stage hydrogen fermentation of molasses (Panagiotopoulos et al., 2010; Özgür et al., 2010) whereas process parameters in the Optimistic case should be possible to achieve in the future providing the two-stage process is further developed (Claassen, 2010). In order to make it possible to compare the results of this study with those of HYVOLUTION project, it is assumed that the gross hydrogen output of the plant is 60 kg/h (equivalent to an energy flow of 2000 kW) and that in average, photofermentation is operated 10 h/day. The latter assumption implies that the amount of acetate solution produced in the thermophilic bioreactors during 24 h will be processed in the photobioreactor during 10 h. Before carrying out the main part of cost studies, certain aspects of hydrogen production were analyzed to demonstrate the link between the energy use and cost effectiveness. For the Base case, the hydrogen production cost was calculated along with the process energy yield expressed as the ratio of the energy flow in produced hydrogen to the sum of average heat and power demand of the process. Fig. 5 shows the influence of make-up water temperature on the production cost and energy yield. At decreasing water temperature, the heat demand for water preheating before thermophilic fermentation is increased leading to higher hydrogen production cost and reduced energy yield. If molasses was diluted by well water at a temperature of 8 °C, then the energy yield would be close to 1 implying that the amount of energy consumed in the production plant is simply converted into an equal amount of hydrogen energy and therefore the production cannot be profitable. This result underlines the importance of heat recovery by external recycling of wastewater discharged from photofermentation to thermophilic fermentation. For further analysis it was assumed that during 10 h operation of the photobioreactor in daylight, only a part of the wastewater stream is directly recycled to the thermophilic bioreactors while the remaining part is collected in a storage tank properly insulated to prevent heat losses. During the subsequent time interval of 14 h, molasses is diluted using warm wastewater from storage. A summary of results of the parametric study is presented in Table 4 . The specific costs of hydrogen production for the two cases Base and Update are very high exceeding 30 €/kg. It is interesting that the two cost values are so close even though hydrogen productivity in the Update case is lower and therefore more molasses and more energy is consumed. This is a consequence of the contribution of photofermentation to the overall cost being so large that other cost components are not very important. In the Optimistic case, for which a substantial improvement in the performance of photofermentation is assumed, the specific cost of hydrogen production is reduced by a factor of 3. The structure of the specific cost of hydrogen production is illustrated in Fig. 6 . For all the cases considered, the capital cost is the largest component of the overall cost. The labor cost is an order of magnitude lower than the capital or operating cost. The cost of raw material is also comparatively low but becomes significant in the optimistic case. The contributions of various parts of the production plant to the capital cost are shown in Fig. 7 . As the required area of the photobioreactor is very large (see Table 4), its share in the capital cost is several times larger than that of thermophilic fermentation and gas upgrading considered jointly. Similarly, the share of photofermentation in the operating cost is very large due to a high cost of the annual replacement of LDPE tubes. As can be seen in Fig. 8 , the associated part of the operating cost is larger than that of any other cost component. However, in the Optimistic case, the contribution of chemicals also becomes significant."
4,Concluding remarks,"The modelling approach outlined above can be applied to the processing of any sucrose-containing solution which can be supplied from a sugar factory to a hydrogen plant. In the present work, considering the availability of experimental data which are necessary for the simulation of key process stages, molasses was assumed as a feedstock. At first glance the results of the presented techno-economic analysis of the two-stage fermentative process are not encouraging. Based on the current state of knowledge, industrial-scale fermentative conversion of molasses into hydrogen cannot be competitive due mainly to high costs of the photofermentation stage. This statement may be extended to hypothetical cases of molasses being replaced by other technical sugar solutions, i.e. raw juice or thick juice, that can be obtained from a beet sugar factory. It should however be noted that at the start of project HYVOLUTION in the beginning of 2006, the commercialization of its results was foreseen not earlier than 2015, understood as a possible date of creation of the European hydrogen market. Consequently, it would be premature to definitively evaluate the application potential of two-stage hydrogen fermentation using process data available shortly after project closure in 2010. Undoubtedly, HYVOLUTION has significantly contributed to the improved understanding of the two-stage process including photofermentation stage. Research presently being carried out by various research groups is aimed at improving the performance of that stage and optimizing the photobioreactor design, so that reductions in the operation and investment costs are possible in short to medium term. Work is also conducted on ways to decrease the consumption of chemicals in both fermentation stages, aiming at further reduction in the operating cost. Regarding future research, it is of interest to sugar manufacturing companies that in parallel to sugar-containing solutions, beet pulp and beet leaves, as well as other lignocellulosics (like weed separated from beet roots prior to their processing) are potentially available for conversion to biofuels. As the use of pulp and leaves as components of animal feed is in decline, there are examples of such materials being successfully processed to methane in full-scale biogas plants connected with sugar factories. Depending on the development of methods of conversion of lignocellulosic materials into feedstocks suitable for hydrogen fermentation, in medium to long term it may be possible to produce hydrogen also from beet pulp and beet leaves."
