0,Introduction,"In this context of global warming, the use of H2 as an energy carrier could be an interesting low-carbon solution. Nowadays, hydrogen is mainly produced from fossil-derived feedstocks, normally, through the steam reforming (SR) of natural gas [1], which major drawback is the large amount of CO2 emitted [2]. Dumesic et al. [3] discovered in 2002 an alternative process to obtain biohydrogen from renewable sources at mild temperature (200–270 ºC) and moderate pressure (25–50 bar) by the Aqueous-Phase Reforming (APR) of biomass-derived oxygenates. It should be noted that APR is more advantageous than SR due to its lower energy requirements (i.e. no need of water evaporation), the reduction of undesirable side-reactions which decrease the hydrogen yield, the lower CO concentration in the gas, and the ease of separation of the APR products. Sort of biomass-derived substrates have been used for hydrogen production by APR, including ethanol [4], ethylene glycol [5], glycerol [6], xylitol [7], sorbitol [8], and glucose [9]. Among these, glycerol is one of the most promising substrates. Glycerol, a major by-product (E factor 0.1) of the biodiesel production process [10], can serve as a substrate for the production of various higher value-added products, and thus, has been included as one of the 12 platform molecules for biorefineries [11]. The boom experienced by biodiesel production in the last two decades has led to a huge surplus of glycerol in the world market [12]. Its valorisation into higher value-added products would contribute to a higher profitability of biorefineries. In order to maximize the hydrogen selectivity in the APR of polyols, the catalysts should promote C-H and C-C bond scission and deactivate C-O bond cleavage reactions. In general, low acidity supports are preferred. WGS-active catalysts could provide high hydrogen yields in the aqueous-phase reforming what has been ascribed to their inherent ability for removing the adsorbed CO molecules from the metallic sites [13]. Group VIII metals, especially Pt, fulfil all the above requirements. However, cheaper metals should be investigated, as for example Ni, which has attracted considerable attention during the last years. Another major consideration involved in designing an adequate APR catalyst is the hydrothermal stability of the support. Conventional γ-alumina is known to have poor thermal and hydrothermal stability [14,15]. In our previous work, we investigated Ni-based catalysts derived from spinel-like NiAl2O4 precursor [16] in the APR of glycerol. The use of nickel aluminate spinel improved the dispersion of the metallic phase and ensured the hydrothermal stability of the support. In addition, NiAl2O4 spinel contained oxygen vacancies, providing crucial active sites for WGS activity [17]. With this background in mind, it might be useful to investigate new methods to improve the activity and hydrogen selectivity of NiAl2O4-derived catalysts. The strategy followed in the present work is based on the addition of basic oxides as promoters. Among others, Cu, La, Co, Zn and Br have been reported as structural modifiers of Ni/Al2O3 which effectively promoted the APR of glycerol [3,18]. Basic oxides such as MgO, La2O3, CeO2 or CaO have been used to modify or neutralize the acidic alumina [19,20]. Magnesium has been used as promoter of Ni/Al2O3 for the partial oxidation of methane [21] and glycerol APR [22] and provides structural stabilization of Ni/Al2O3 [23]. On the other hand, the high redox capacity of ceria facilitates reduction of nickel species. Also, Ce-Ni interactions can promote the catalytic behaviour by creation of new species [24]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the effect of Ce and Mg used as promoters of nickel aluminate spinel catalyst for the use in the Aqueous-Phase Reforming. Ni/Al2O3 (by impregnation) and NiAl2O4 (by coprecipitation) doped with Ce or Mg (at 5 wt%) were synthesized. These were thoroughly characterised by XRD, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, H2-TPR, electronic microscopy, ICP, CO2-TPD and NH3-TPD techniques, and tested in the APR of glycerol, CO hydrogenation and WGS reactions in order to elucidate any structure-activity relationship."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation Nickel aluminate spinel with Al/Ni = 2 (mol ratio) was synthesized by coprecipitation. Details on the synthesis can be found elsewhere [16]. The as-prepared solid was divided into three parts: one part was no further modified (labelled NiAl) and the other two parts were subjected to either Ce or Mg addition (5 wt%) by wet-impregnation (WI). Cerium (III) nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)3.6 H2O, Sigma-Aldrich) and magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (Mg(NO3)2.6 H2O, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as metal precursors. The obtained solids were dried overnight at 110 ºC in an oven and finally calcined in a muffle. Ce/NiAl catalyst was calcined at 600 ºC for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 ºC/min, while Mg/NiAl catalyst was calcined at 850 ºC for 4 h with a heating rate of 10 ºC/min. For comparison purposes, Ni (from nickel (II) acetate tetrahydrate precursor) was also impregnated onto γ-Al2O3 (labelled Ni/Al) at 18 wt% Ni loading in order to match the extra lattice nickel content of NiAl spinel reduced at 700 ºC for 1 h [16]. All the samples were pelletized at 0.04–0.16 mm. APR exhausted catalysts were named adding -U to their label."
3,Catalyst characterization studies,"2.2 Catalyst characterization studies ICP-AES was used to analyse the bulk chemical composition of the samples and the presence of leached metals in the post-reaction liquid solutions. The textural properties of the prepared solids were evaluated from N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K in a Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 equipment. Before the experiment, the solid was degassed at 300 °C for 10 h in order to clean the surface. The specific surface area and pore size distribution were determined by BET and BJH formalisms, respectively. Powder XRD was measured by means of a PANalytical Xpert PRO diffractometer in 2θ range 10–80º, at 0.026º steps. The crystallite size was calculated from the X-ray line broadening analysis. The identification of the crystal phases was carried out on the basis of ICDD database. Reducibility of the solids was evaluated by temperature-programmed reduction with hydrogen (H2-TPR) performed in a Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 apparatus. The sample was placed in the U-shaped quartz reactor. Firstly, the solid was cleaned by flushing 50 mL/min of He at 550 ºC for 1 h, and subsequently cooled down to 50 ºC. Then, analysis was carried out by flowing 5% H2/Ar stream though the sample and rising the temperature from room temperature to 950 °C at 10 °C/min, monitoring the signal by TCD. The water formed during the reduction was trapped using a cold trap. The total H2-uptake was calculated from the integration of the H2-TPR profile and defined as TPR950. Additional H2-TPR runs were carried out to determine the reduction degree and nickel speciation. Firstly, the sample was reduced at 700 °C for 1 h, simulating the reduction step before the catalytic tests (H2 uptake in this step was named TPR700). Then, after cooled down to room temperature, second H2-TPR run was done up to 950 °C (H2 uptake was named TPR700/950). Reduction degree (RDNi) was calculated, as follows: (1) R D N i ( % ) = H 2 T P R 700 H 2 T P R 700 + H 2 T P R 700 / 950 × 100 where H 2 T P R i is the hydrogen uptake in stage i. TPR of the spent catalysts (TPRspent) was carried out with the similar protocol of TPR950, but removing the cold trap and following the releases gases by MS (Hiden Analytical). The micrographs along with elemental EDX-maps of the ex-situ reduced catalysts were obtained by a FEI Titan Cubed G2 60–300 microscope, composed of a high-brightness X-FEG Schottky field emission electron gun, monochromator, CEOS Gmbh spherical aberration corrector and Super-X EDX system with High-Angle Annular Dark-Field (HAADF) detector for Z contrast imaging in Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) configuration. The metallic nickel particle size distribution was determined by measuring the diameter ( d ) of at least 240 particles. After that, the average nickel dispersion (DNi 0) was estimated applying d-FE model [25]. The average diameter of the Ni0 particle ( d N i 0 , T E M ) was estimated from volume to surface ratio. Metallic surface area, (S Ni 0 ) was calculated taking as follows: (2) S N i 0 ( m 2 / g ) = A N i o · 0.01 · R D N i · D N i 0 · N A M W N i where, A Ni o is the atomic area of Ni, N A the Avogadro number and MW Ni the molecular weight of Ni. The population, strength and distribution of acid and basic sites were determined by NH3 and CO2 temperature programmed desorption, respectively, in a Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 equipment. Before both analysis, the sample was cleaned by flowing He at 550 °C for 1 h. After cooled down to room temperature, the catalyst was reduced at 700 °C for 1 h, and then cooled down to room temperature under He flow. For acidity evaluation, a sequence of 10% NH3/He pulses were injected at 90 °C up to saturation of the sample, and flushed with He flow in between each ammonia pulse. Then, the sample was heated up to 850 °C at 10 ºC/min under He and the desorbed NH3 was recorded. For basicity evaluation, the sample was saturated by flowing 50 mL/min 5% CO2/He at 50 °C for 1 h, then flushed out with He flow for 1 h. Then, the sample was heated up to 850 °C at 10 ºC/min under He and the CO2 desorbed was recorded."
4,Catalytic performance evaluation,"2.3 Catalytic performance evaluation Aqueous-Phase Reforming (APR) of glycerol aqueous solution (10 wt% glycerol) was carried out in a ﬁxed-bed reactor (PID Eng&TEch) at 235 ºC and 35 bar and WHSV = 24.5 h−1. Catalyst was reduced in-situ with 20% H2/He flow at 700 ºC and atmospheric pressure, for 1 h. Hereafter, reactor was pressurised with He up to the desired pressure, then the He flow was switched to bypass and 0.2 mL/min of the glycerol solution was pumped into the reactor while the temperature was progressively raised at 5 ºC/min up to the reaction temperature. Catalytic performance was measured at 3 h TOS (time on stream). The reactor effluent was cooled down and the gas and liquid phases separated. The gaseous products were swept away with a He flow (40 mL/min). Gas product distribution was continuously analyzed by a μGC (Agilent). The liquid product was collected every 15 min in glass vials and off-line analysed by GC-FID (Agilent, 6890 N) and HPLC-RI (Waters, Hi-Plex H column). Total organic carbon (TOC) in the liquid phase was measured on a Shimadzu TOC-L apparatus. The carbon balance was above 97% for all the experiments. Glycerol conversion (XGly) and conversion to gas (Xgas) were calculated as follows: (3) X G l y ( % ) = 100 · F G l y i n - F G l y o u t F G l y i n (4) X g a s ( % ) = 100 · F C a t o m s i n - F C a t o m s , l i q u i d o u t F C a t o m s i n Selectivity to hydrogen (SH2) was calculated as follows: (5) S H 2 ( % ) = 100 · F H 2 o u t F H 2 o u t + n + 1 · F C n H 2 n + 2 o u t The selectivity to alkanes was calculated as follows: (6) S A l k a n e s ( % ) = 100 · F C a t o m s i n A l k a n e s o u t F C a t o m s o u t Hydrogen yield (YH2) was calculated as follows: (7) Y H 2 ( % ) = 100 · F H 2 o u t F G l y i n · 1 7 The yield of the liquid compounds (YLiq,i) was calculated as the carbon molar flow in a given liquid compound (FC_Liq,i) divided by the total carbon flow in the liquid products (FC_Liq): (8) Y L i q , i = 100 × F C _ L i q , i F C _ L i q CO hydrogenation and WGS reactions were performed in a fixed bed reactor (P&ID EngTech) at 350 °C and atmospheric pressure, at GHSV 12,000 h−1. The feedstream composition was (in vol%): CO/H2/He: 7.5/10/82.5 for CO hydrogenation; and CO/H2O/H2/He: 7.5/25/10/57.5 for WGS reaction. CO conversion and selectivity to CO2 (SCO2) in CO hydrogenation and WGS experiments were calculated as follows: (9) X C O ( % ) = 100 · F C O i n − F C O o u t F C O i n (10) S C O 2 ( % ) = 100 · F C O 2 o u t F C O i n − F C O o u t"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst activity,"3.1 Catalyst activity Glycerol conversion (XGly), conversion to gas (Xgas) and H2 yield (YH2) are shown in Fig. 1. The Weisz-Prater and Mears criteria were applied and the obtained values (Table S1, Supporting Information) indicated that the catalytic APR experiments were done under kinetic regime, that is, in the absence of mass-transfer limitations. Differences were observed in the performance of the unpromoted catalysts, NiAl and Ni/Al (Fig. 1). The sample NiAl was much more active than its counterpart Ni/Al (XGly: 13% vs 65%; Xgas: 2% vs 27%; YH2: 0.3% vs 8%). Clearly, spinel-derived nickel nanoparticles were much more active for hydrogen production by APR than those obtained by impregnation onto alumina. Thus, the promoter (Ce or Mg) was finally added to NiAl catalyst instead of to Ni/Al. Fig. 1a show that doping of Mg did not improve glycerol conversion. Moreover, XGly slightly decreased after Mg addition (64% vs. 60%). Likewise, a detrimental effect was observed in Xgas (27% vs 24%) whereas the YH2 barely increased (8.0% vs 8.3%). Contrarily, Ce created an advantageous effect on the catalyst performance. The marked differences between the conversion values (XGly 64–73% vs. Xgas 24–34%) reflected that APR of glycerol produced a significant amount of liquid-phase products in addition to hydrogen. Fig. 1b allows us to compare the catalyst performance in terms of hydrogen and alkane selectivity. Catalyst Ni/Al showed high hydrogen selectivity (74%) as due to its poor CC cleavage activity. Its counterpart NiAl had 55% selectivity to hydrogen. Ce and Mg doped catalysts slightly enhanced the SH2 of the parent NiAl (SH2 around 60%). The highest selectivity to alkanes was achieved by catalyst Ni/Al (SAlkanes = 56%), with similar ethane and methane production (Table S2, Supporting Information). Its counterpart NiAl, showed a much lesser selectivity of 38% (close to that obtained by the promoted assays). For the coprecipitated assays, the methane to alkanes mole ratio was above 0.90. Ce/NiAl showed the highest hydrogen production-rate, of 3.4 mmolH2/min·gNi. The moles of hydrogen produced per mole of glycerol converted ( Table 1) was ten-fold larger in the spinel-based catalysts and among them, promoted catalysts increased by 10% that of NiAl. Table 1 revealed that H2, CO2, and CH4 were the main products of the APR of glycerol (accounted for more than 98% of the detected compounds). CO was also detected, although in much lower amounts. H2 concentration varied between 50% and 85% (maximum by catalyst Ni/Al). CO2 was the second most abundant compound (27–29%), except for catalyst Ni/Al (< 4%). CH4 concentration varied between 6% and 19%, being catalyst Ni/Al, again, the one with the lowest value. In an ideal glycerol APR reaction, stoichiometric H2/CO2 ratio should be 2.3. It ranged from 1.7 to 2.0 for our spinel-derived catalysts, indicating that some hydrogen was consumed in parallel reactions. Indeed, nickel is known to be very active in the CO and CO2 methanation reactions [26–28]. To have light on the gas product distribution, WGS and CO hydrogenation activity was also investigated ( Table 2). Methane was the only product in the absence of water and, under WGS conditions, both CO2 and CH4 were formed. In both reaction, NiAl showed higher XCO than its counterpart Ni/Al. Feeding only CO and H2 the promoted catalysts showed around ten-fold increased CO conversion with respect NiAl (i.e. XCO>30% vs XCO = 3%). This was in line with others that reported that both Ce and Ce promote CO hydrogenation reaction [29,30]. Under WGS conditions, these differences further increased as XCO raised up to 67% by catalyst Mg/NiAl (XCO < 5% by the unpromoted catalysts). NiAl was 20% more active than Ni/Al for hydrogen production by WGS. Moreover, Ce or Mg doping further increased the WGS activity. It is well known that basic surfaces promote WGS reaction [31] by facilitating the water dissociation [32,33]. By means of WGS, CO can be converted into CO2 giving additional H2. Therefore, catalysts that promote WGS are crucial for obtaining a high hydrogen selectivity [13]. However, a high selectivity to methane was also shown (SCH4 about 30% for both promoted catalysts), in line with the high ability of nickel for CO methanation [34]. The CO/CO2 molar ratio during the APR of glycerol (Table S2, Supporting Information) was three-fold lower in the promoted catalysts, in line with the estimated relative WGS reaction rates (Table 2), and suggested that both Ce and Mg increase the CO conversion through the WGS reaction. This was corroborated by the three-fold lower CO/H2 values measured for both promoted catalysts (Table 1) in glycerol APR. With respect to the liquid-phase product distribution (Table 1), it should be noted that a significant fraction of carbon atoms in the feed (98% for Ni/Al, 66–76% for spinel-derived catalysts) was retained in the liquid phase. Several oxygenated liquid compounds were detected: propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, ethanol, hydroxyacetone, methanol and acetaldehyde (accounting for over 97% of the carbon in the liquid phase). Propionaldehyde and propanols were detected in trace quantities."
7,General reaction path,"3.2 General reaction path The obtained gas and liquid product distribution evidenced the occurrence of both dehydration and hydrogenation reactions. With the observed product distributions for glycerol APR a plausible reaction pathway with two reaction paths consistent with bifunctional (metallic and Lewis acid functions) nature is depicted in Scheme 1. Compared to Ni/Al catalyst, spinel-derived catalysts showed boosted yield of H2 per mole of glycerol converted. Among the both promoted catalysts gave the maximum H2 production of 0.96 molH2/molGly converted. Dehydrogenation of glycerol followed by decarbonylation (CC cleavage) and subsequent WGS reaction led to the formation of H2 and CO2 (Path I, over metallic sites) [35,36]. When dehydration (CO cleavage) occurs, H2 is consumed in the subsequent hydrogenation reactions (Path II, over acidic and metallic sites) that led to the formation of oxygenated liquids, which can be thereafter converted to alkanes. Thus, catalysts with enhanced capacity for CC bond cleavage typically favour hydrogen production while a high activity in CO bond cleavage is typically associated with alkane formation [37,38]. The primary product from Path I (glyceraldehyde) was not detected, due to its high reactivity [39]. The main liquid product of Ni/Al was hydroxyacetone. Products from Path I were detected at trace levels, in line with its extremely low H2 production rate. The spinel-derived catalysts showed a different liquid-phase composition. These produced mainly propylene glycol, product of CO cleavage (Path II), followed by ethylene glycol, product of CC bond cleavage (Path I). The spinel series showed a greater propylene glycol to hydroxyacetone mole ratio, suggesting an important hydrogenation activity. Interestingly, the Mg and Ce doped assays, showed a subtle tendency to decrease the yield of ethylene glycol and, concomitantly, increase that of small chain alcohols (i.e. ethanol). This behaviour was ascribed to the ability of Mg and Ce doped assays for CC bond cleavage, in line with their higher selectivity to hydrogen. Liquid products were grouped by the type of bond scission (Table 1), and the most outstanding difference was between Ni/Al and spinel-derived catalyst, the former producing vastly CO scission products, while no appreciable differences among the doped catalysts and their parent NiAl. It can be concluded that the catalyst synthesis method strongly affected its relative activity for the CC to CO bond scission. The high hydrogenation activity and selectivity to methane observed for the promoted catalysts suggested that CH4 was mainly produced through hydrogen consuming reactions (both CO and CO2 hydrogenation), with the concomitant decrease in hydrogen selectivity. As seen above CO2 was preferentially produced over CH4 (CO2/CH4 ratio: 1.5–1.6) for all the spinel-derived catalysts, what suggested that Path I was promoted."
8,Materials characterization,"3.3 Materials characterization 3.3.1 Textural properties The specific surface area (SBET) of the catalysts is shown in Table 3. All the calcined solids presented Type IV isotherms with H2 hysteresis (Fig. S1, Supporting Information), with the P/P0 position of the inflection point corresponding to the mesoporous range. Catalyst NiAl had a 40% larger specific surface area than Ni/Al. In addition, pore volume and the average pore size were two-fold increased (Table S3, Supporting Information). With promoter, the SBET decreased due to pore blockage. This phenomenon was more pronounced for the Mg doped sample (6% and 29% decrease in Ce/NiAl and Mg/NiAl, respectively) due to its higher calcination temperature. The average pore size of the parent NiAl was preserved in the promoted samples. The effect of reduction treatment (20% H2 flow up to 700 ºC, hold 1 h) on the texture was also investigated. In the case of the unpromoted solids, an opposed behaviour was observed where SBET of Ni/Al increased (i.e. 9%) while that of NiAl decreased by 15%. For the promoted samples, SBET of Ce/NiAl decreased by 8% and no appreciable variation was observed for Mg/NiAl sample. Indeed, the non-reducible nature of MgO, in contrast to the high reducibility of ceria, could stabilize the support [40]. With respect to the exhausted catalysts, a notable increase in SBET was observed (Table 3). Among the unpromoted catalysts, Ni/Al-U showed the highest increase (i.e. 60%) while its counterpart NiAl-U increased by 40%. The increase in SBET was ascribed to the hydration of γ-alumina. Boehmite could be leached-off and re-deposited on the catalyst surface, generating additional porosity in the solid [41,42]. The notable increase of the SBET of spent Ni/Al is in line with its higher content in γ-alumina. The promoted catalysts showed the lowest variation in SBET (i.e. 5–14% increase) suggesting that both Ce and Mg doping were helpful to maintain the stability of the textural properties under harsh hydrothermal conditions. With phase modification of the support metal particle detachment can occur, causing sintering or leaching [43]. The liquid product of the APR (Table 3) showed 0.2–1.6% Ni leaching. Leaching of Al was low (0.05%), due to its re-deposition on the surface [44]. Ce leaching was very low (i.e. 0.24%) as compared to magnesium (i.e. 13%), in line with literature [45,46]. In addition, Mg could also be detached by the formation and posterior elution of Mg organometallic complexes. 3.3.2 XRD analysis XRD of the calcined Ni/Al contained three crystallographic phases, namely, γ-Al2O3 (JCPDS 01–079–1558), NiO (JCPDS 01–078–0643) and NiAl2O4 spinel (JCPDS 00–010–0339) ( Fig. 2). NiO peaks were narrow, indicative of the presence of large crystallites, consistent with the used impregnation method, which favours formation of large metal oxide clusters. NiAl2O4 was formed upon calcination, as high temperatures favour the migration of nickel atoms in close contact with alumina into the alumina framework [47]. NiO was not detected in the reduced samples while new diffraction peaks corresponding to Ni0 (JCPDS 01–087–0712) appeared, indicative of the complete reduction of the nickel oxide particles. In addition, characteristic peaks of the spinel-phase were still identified, reflecting its low reducibility. The XRD of the calcined NiAl matched that of NiAl2O4 spinel. Unlike for catalyst Ni/Al, NiO was not detected, what suggested that Ni was mainly forming the spinel or existed as fine particles (2–5 nm). Upon reduction, the presence of metallic Ni was confirmed, together with NiAl2O4 spinel. During the reduction, nickel cations located in the spinel framework can readily migrate to the surface, leaving the bulk enriched in γ-Al2O3 [48]. γ-Al2O3 cannot be detected by XRD due to its amorphous nature. In Ce/NiAl and Mg/NiAl solids, spinel was clearly identified. In catalyst Ce/NiAl characteristic diffraction peaks of CeO2 (JCPDS 00–034–0394) could be observed. Catalyst Mg/NiAl showed peaks characteristic of MgO (JCPDS 00–045–0946) and MgNiO2 (JCPDS 00–024–0712). In sample Mg/NiAl, diffraction peaks of the spinel-phase shifted to lower 2θ as compared to parent NiAl (Fig. S2, Supporting Information), due to the formation of Ni(Mg)Al2O4 spinel. The high calcination temperature applied to the Mg-doped assay could promoted the diffusion of Mg2+ ions (ionic radius 0.72 Å) to the sites occupied by Ni2+ ions (ionic radius 0.69 Å) in the original spinel. The increase in the lattice parameters (8.0397 vs 8.0474 Å for NiAl and Mg/NiAl, respectively) confirms the incorporation of Mg ions. Also, formation of the MgO-NiO solid solution was favoured by the high calcination temperature [49]. Upon reduction of the promoted assays, the spinel-phase could be still detected whereas no characteristic diffraction peaks of NiO were observed. The absence of characteristic peaks for any Ce-containing phase suggested that Ce2O3 particles existed at below XRD detection limit or as an amorphous phase [50]. A similar outcome could be achieved for catalyst Mg/NiAl since no characteristic diffraction peaks of MgO nor MgNiO2 were detected. Again, in the reduced Mg/NiAl sample, diffraction peaks of the spinel-phase downshifted (Fig. S2, Supporting Information), suggesting the presence of Ni(Mg)Al2O4 spinel [20]. This hypothesis was confirmed by a reduction experiment (up to 1000 ºC in 5% H2/Ar flow) carried out with a 10 wt% Mg loaded NiAl2O4. Phase evolution was analysed by XRD (Fig. S3, Supporting Information) which showed a downshift ascribed to the formation of Ni(Mg)Al2O4. The average values of the metallic Ni crystallites are given in Table 4. By far, Ni/Al contained the largest metallic Ni crystallites (31 nm). Much finer Ni particles were formed in catalyst NiAl (15 nm). A further decrease in Ni0 size was observed for both promoted catalysts (decrease by 50%), suggesting that the addition of Mg and Ce enhanced the resistance against sintering during reduction. In order to gain knowledge on the effect of APR reaction conditions on the structural properties of the catalysts, XRD of the spent catalysts were also collected (Fig. 2). Interestingly, none of the catalysts presented characteristic peaks of carbonaceous material, due to the basic characteristics of the catalyst surface [51]. Diffraction peaks from boehmite (JCPDS 01–083–2384) were identified in the exhausted Ni/Al assay. As previously noted, under harsh hydrothermal conditions, γ-AlO(OH) can be readily formed by hydration of γ-Al2O3 [52,53]. Spinel phase reflections were visible, suggesting that the hydration of alumina was limited to the surface. Interestingly, intense and narrow peaks characteristic of metallic Ni phase could be observed. With respect to its counterpart NiAl-U, the absence of boehmite peaks suggested that spinel structure was mostly retained under hydrothermal conditions. Metallic Ni was detected for NiAl suggesting that the spinel-derived catalysts are promising for the aqueous-phase reactions, due to their higher phase stability, as compared to alumina-supported catalyst. In fact, it is accepted that the presence of metal hinders the hydration of γ-alumina to boehmite [54]. Mg better stabilized the catalyst structure as compared to Ce. XRD of Mg/NiAl-U was similar to that of the fresh (reduced) sample, which contained both spinel and Ni0 phases. No other crystalline phase was detected by XRD. Ce/NiAl-U showed a more complex XRD pattern. Apart of the spinel and Ni0 peaks, a sort of narrow and intense peaks of cerium carbonate hydroxide (JCPDS 00–032–0189) appeared, formed by the carbonation of ceria by the gas-phase CO [55]. Characteristic peaks of ceria still could be observed, suggesting oxidation of this sample. The absence of boehmite in both promoted spent samples indicated that both promoters increased the hydrothermal resistance, especially in the case of the Mg-doped sample, which even preserved the size of the Ni0 crystallites during the APR reaction (i.e. 7–8 nm, Table 4). 3.3.3 H2-TPR analysis The reduction profile of the investigated catalysts is shown in Fig. 3, and the H2 consumption is summarised in Table 5. Catalyst Ni/Al showed two reduction events indicating the presence of, at least, two Ni2+ species, namely NiO and the nickel in spinel phase. The low temperature peak (peak-α, with its maximum at around 460 ºC) was assigned to NiO particles weakly interacting with the alumina support. The asymmetry of peak-α suggested the presence of NiO particles of different size and varying strength of interaction with the support [56]. Deconvolution allowed to identify four peaks centred at around 230, 310, 415 and 470 ºC. The high temperature peak (peak-γ, centred at around 810 ºC) was ascribed to nickel in the spinel structure (i.e. NiAl2O4) [16]. About of 59% of the Ni remained as free NiO (Table 3). Catalyst NiAl showed a large and intense reduction event starting at 225 ºC. The left tail indicated the existence of different nickel species. Deconvolution allowed differentiating three main peaks: peak-α (surface free NiO particles, at around 400 ºC), peak-β (sub-stoichiometric nickel spinel, at around 685 ºC) and peak-γ (NiAl2O4, at around 790 ºC). Free NiO accounted for less than 5% of the total Ni for this sample. Non-stoichiometric and stoichiometric nickel aluminate spinel were formed in similar amounts during the calcination. The reduction profile of the Ce-doped sample (Ce/NiAl) was similar to that of the parent catalyst (NiAl) with a subtle shift of the peak-β to lower temperatures, in line with others [57]. Taking as a reference the bulk ceria reduction profile, there was an absence of separated, clear reduction peaks of isolated CeO2 species (which presence was confirmed by XRD) indicating they were masked by the intense peaks β and γ. Contrarily, catalyst Mg/NiAl presented a notably different reduction profile. This case, peak-β and peak-γ could be resolved from peak-γ since the latter appeared shifted to a higher temperature (peak maximum at 845 ºC). This behaviour was ascribed to the lesser reducibility of the spinel phase Ni(Mg)Al2O4 (detected by XRD) caused by a strong MgO-NiO interaction [58,59]. Instead, peak-β, centred at around 690 ºC, remained unaltered in both the position and intensity. As previously noted, around 40% of the Ni atoms in Ni/Al assay were incorporated to the spinel, and increased to above 90% for the coprecipitated samples. This was a determinant factor in stabilizing the Ni0 particles since the NiAl2O4 structure suppressed their coarsening upon reduction [47]. This was evidenced by the four times smaller Ni0 size in the NiAl series as compared to Ni/Al (Table 4). These smaller particles were much more active in the glycerol conversion by APR. Prior to the catalytic runs, the catalysts were reduced at 700 ºC, for 1 h. In order to measure the reduction degree of Ni (RDNi) and the amount of metallic Ni out of the spinel lattice the so-called TPR700 and TPR700/950 procedures were used. TPR700 profiles, shown in Fig. S4 (Supporting Information), coincided with the first part of the TPR950 curve (up to 700 ºC). Peak-α was observable in all samples; peak-β was partly developed, and peak-γ was absent in all samples. Overall, RDNi varied in the 57–89% (Table 5), being the highest for Ni/Al and Ce/NiAl and lowest for Mg/NiAl. The TPR700/950 reduction profiles showed a single reduction peak, at above 700 ºC. For sample Ni/Al, it was centred at 816 ºC and downshifted in the case of NiAl (780 ºC), indicating that nickel species were more readily reduced in the co-precipitated assay. The further downshift for sample Ce/NiAl (770 ºC) revealed the promotion effect of Ce. On the contrary, the upshift in sample Mg/NiAl (844 ºC) suggested the formation of Ni(Mg)Al2O4 spinel during reduction, in line with XRD data, and indicated that reduction of nickel was hindered by the strong interaction with MgO. It is interesting to note that, for all the samples, the sum of hydrogen uptake from TPR700 and TPR700/950 coincided with that from TPR950. The absence of hydrogen consumption below 700 ºC in the TPR700/950 run indicated that NiO particles were readily reduced in all catalysts by the established pre-reaction reduction protocol. Also, all the nickel in the non-stoichiometric spinel phase (peak-β) of catalysts Ni/Al, NiAl and Ce/NiAl was readily reduced. Moreover, 51%, 77% and 78%, respectively, of the nickel in the spinel phase was reduced. As previously noted, catalyst Mg/NiAl showed quite a different reduction behaviour. This case, around 90% of the nickel in the non-stoichiometric phase was reduced, however, that in the spinel phase (peak-γ) remained unreduced. These results coincide with those obtained by Parmalina et al. who reported that Mg-Ni interactions can hinder the reducibility of nickel in Ni(Mg)Al2O4 spinels [49,60]. Oxidation of the active metallic phase has been identified as one of the fundamental reasons for catalyst deactivation in aqueous-phase reactions [61]. Therefore, spent catalysts (tested in glycerol APR at 235 ºC and 35 bar for 3 h) were subjected to TPR analysis (TPRspent) and the evolved gases were analysed by mass spectrometry. Two main hydrogen consumption events could be identified (Fig. S5, Supporting Information): first, in the low-intermediate temperature range (200–600 ºC) and second, at high temperatures (> 600 ºC). The low temperature event was accompanied by the evolution of methane and water. The release of methane suggested that reduction of nickel species took place simultaneously with the hydrogenation of carbonaceous material, likely accumulated into the catalyst pores (glycerol and its APR intermediate liquid products) [61]. The fact that no methane was detected during the high temperature hydrogen consumption event, suggested that solely the reduction of the spinel was taking place. Once subtracted the hydrogen consumption required for methane formation (assuming 2 moles of H2 per mole of methane) the hydrogen uptake ascribed to reduction of the NiO particles (200–600 ºC range) was calculated. Data shown in Table 3 suggested that a significant amount of metallic Ni was oxidized (i.e. 37–51%) during the APR process. However, bulk metallic Ni nanoparticles were preserved, as revealed by XRD analyses. Thus, oxidation seemed to be restricted to the outmost layer of the Ni nanoparticle. Our results showed that NiAl was slightly more resistant to oxidation than the impregnated counterpart (i.e. 37% vs 41%). Also, Ce doping seemed to limit the oxidation of nickel (35% nickel oxidized) while Mg doping caused the opposite behaviour. Metal leaching in aqueous-phase systems proceeds by oxidation, and subsequent hydration to form hydroxide [62]. Indeed, particle size could be involved as suggested by the observed trend in the leached nickel and the average Ni0 particle size in the fresh catalyst (Fig. S6, Supporting Information). It has been reported that smaller Ni nanoparticles are more susceptible to oxidation and leaching [63]. This behaviour would explain the increased average size of Ni0 in the spent Ce/NiAl (Table 2), the catalyst with the highest Ni leaching. Leaching data showed some interesting results. Although Mg-doped assay suffered from oxidation, the leaching of Ni was lowered (i.e. from 0.7% to 0.4%, in NiAl and Mg/NiAl, respectively). It seemed that Mg played a kind of protection role in the leaching of Ni particles. 3.3.4 Nickel particle size distribution and dispersion The particles morphology was studied by TEM ( Fig. 4). The obtained images revealed that unpromoted catalysts contained agglomerates of nickel particles of nearly spherical-shape. A homogeneous particle size distribution was observed in both unpromoted samples, being narrower for the coprecipitated assay. The average metallic Ni particle size of reduced samples (Table 4) and indicated, in general, that Ni0 particles shown by TEM consisted of metallic crystallites agglomerates. Among the unpromoted samples, Ni/Al contained metallic Ni particles of a wide range of sizes, from around 7–70 nm; contrarily, the size distribution was much narrower in the coprecipitated assay, with an average particle of NiAl was around 12 nm, which is four times smaller than the average value measured for Ni/Al (48 nm). Accordingly, both the metal dispersion (10% vs 1.7%) and surface area values (14.1 vs 1.3 m2 Niº/g) were significantly larger for the coprecipitated assay as compared to the impregnated one. These results suggested that the use of nickel aluminate spinel as precursor limited the coalescence of smallest metallic Ni particles during the reduction stage, likely due to the strong interaction of Ni with Al-rich environment (Ni-O-Al). Such interaction stabilized the metallic particles by limiting their surface mobility and thus, by protecting against sintering under reductive atmosphere. In the case of the promoted catalysts, EDS mapping showed the formation of nearly spherical-shape metallic Ni particles. The size distribution in catalyst Ce/NiAl presented a bimodal distribution with maxima at 10 and 15 nm. This catalyst had the largest amount of surface NiO particles (peak-α in TPR) within the spinel-derived series (Table 3: 8% of the total nickel). The fact that α-NiO crystallites are expected to produce, upon reduction, larger metallic Ni particles than those from spinel, would explain the observed bimodal distribution. In line with the above mentioned, catalyst Mg/NiAl, with the least amount of free NiO, showed the smaller size of Ni0 particles (10.6 nm) with a homogenous distribution. Regarding SNi°, Ce/NiAl almost equalled the parent NiAl while Mg/NiAl had notable lesser value. The lower specific surface area (SBET) and reducibility (DRNi) of Mg-doped catalyst were important constraints affecting its catalytic behaviour. 3.3.5 Surface chemistry: basic and acid sites density Surface acid-base properties of the catalysts reduced at 700 ºC were studied by means of NH3 and CO2-TPD techniques (Figs. S7 and S8, Supporting Information). The site densities are listed in Table 4. Catalyst Ni/Al had a relatively low density of basic sites, of weak and medium strength. Catalyst NiAl contained a much larger amount of basic sites (1.12 vs. 0.46 μmolCO2/g) with an appreciable contribution of those of higher strength (14.4%). The density of basic sites increased for both doped samples due to the basic character of both promoters, being the increase larger for Mg/NiAl sample. The most remarkable difference with respect to the parent NiAl was the increase of the medium and strong basic sites (71% for NiAl vs. 80–82% for the promoted assays) (Fig. S7b, Supporting Information). Regarding acidity, unpromoted samples showed a similar surface acidity, what suggested that the exposed alumina, was the main source of acidity. The synthesis method caused a trade-off between medium and weak acid sites (Fig. S8b, Supporting Information). Promotion by Ce or Mg also increased the acid-site density by around 22% and 30%, respectively. It is interesting to note that Ce doping had no effect on the distribution of the acid-sites, whereas incorporation of Mg increased the amount of strong sites. It is worth to note that acid sites were of Lewis-type, consistent with the obtained liquid products distribution. In summary, all of our catalysts presented amphoteric surface properties. High density of basic-sites (i.e. promotion of WGS reaction) and low density of acid-sites (i.e. inhibition of dehydration reactions) have been related to improved hydrogen selectivity [27,31]. Among the unpromoted samples, Ni/Al had the lowest basic-to-acid-sites ratio (RBasic/Acid = 0.25 and 0.57 for Ni/Al and NiAl, respectively). Moreover, the incorporation of Ce and Mg notably increased the prevalence of basic sites (i.e. RBasic/Acid increased by 44% and 79%, respectively) (Table 4). Indeed, this could be related to the observed higher selectivity to hydrogen."
9,General discussion,"3.4 General discussion According to the mechanism previously described for glycerol Aqueous-Phase Reforming over Ni-based catalysts, it is recognized that both the metal and the support play an essential role in the catalytic behaviour [16]. The product-yield can be tailored by the fine-tuning of both functionalities [27]. On one hand, the surface acidity directly affects the activity since glycerol could adsorb on the acid-sites to form hydroxyacetone through CO bond cleavage (dehydration reaction) [63]. The surface basic sites would promote the desired WGS reaction [31]. On the other hand, metallic Ni can activate the organic molecule through the CC bond cleavage to form ethylene glycol. This reaction route releases one mole of CO and H2 per mole of glycerol converted. Indeed, the selectivity towards hydrogen will depend whether the WGS (beneficial) or the CO and CO2 hydrogenation (detrimental) reactions is promoted by the metallic sites. According to activity results, NiAl catalyst, derived from nickel aluminate spinel, was more advantageous than that prepared by the conventional impregnation procedure (Ni/Al). The latter contained coarse metallic Ni particles and, correspondingly, very low SNi° (ten-fold decrease as compared to NiAl). Indeed, the synthesis procedure notably affected the catalysts physico-chemical properties, and therefore, APR activity. It could be deduced that small metallic Ni particles are crucial to achieve highly active catalysts for the APR; however, small nickel particles can also activate CO to drive hydrogenation reactions [64], which would reduce selectivity to hydrogen [65]. The observed behaviour is in contrast to the reported activity vs. metal particle trend for Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, where the cleavage of CC bonds preferably occurred on the facet Pt atoms rather than on edge and corner atoms (i.e., larger Pt particles were more active) [66]. In addition, the observed difference in the acid/basic functionalities might be involved in the divergent activity and product distribution of the unpromoted catalysts. The prevalence of acid sites in catalyst Ni/Al (Rbasic/acid was half of NiAl) would explain the obtained liquid product distribution, which was mainly composed by dehydration products, with a negligible hydrogen yield. It was observed that Ce doping improved the APR activity, whereas it was slight decreased by Mg doping. The hydrogen yield and selectivity were slightly increased by both promoters, whereas no effect on methane selectivity was reported. XRD and TEM measurements concluded that smaller metallic Ni particles were formed upon reduction of both promoted catalysts (around half of those in NiAl) and, consequently, SNi°, that is, the available metallic sites, increased by 15–36%. Others also found that magnesium, deposited by impregnation on nickel aluminate spinel, could help to prevent the sintering of the metallic nickel particles. The reducibility of the spinel based catalysts has been found to increase upon Ce doping, and nickel species in the spinel phase, could be reduced at 700 ºC. Contrarily, the formation of magnesium-nickel aluminate spinel, which is a difficult-to-reduce species, led to a lower degree of reduction of the Mg/NiAl catalyst. This case, the nickel species in the spinel phase could not be reduced. Doping of either Ce or Mg increased the density of basic and acid functionalities on the catalysts surface, with a more marked increase of basic sites [67]. Moreover, the strength of the acid and basic sites was increased. The presence of CO2 and CH4 in the gas stream during glycerol APR indicated that the investigated catalysts were active for the CC bond cleavage. According to the reaction pathway, CO2 formation requires a first dehydrogenation step, to form glyceraldehyde, followed by decarbonylation and further conversion of the released CO by WGS. Therefore, 2 moles of H2 are formed for each mole of CO2 produced. However, the production of CH4 implies hydrogen consumption. Methane could be produced by either hydrogenation of the released CO or by dehydration of intermediate liquid products (i.e. ethylene glycol) and subsequent CC bond cleavage and hydrogenation. The CO2/CH4 mole ratio in the gaseous products by the spinel-derived catalysts was three-fold larger than Ni/Al (0.55), indicating the higher H2 selectivity of the formers, likely due to a lowered basic to acid-sites ratio and the less accessible metallic Ni surface. Among the promoted catalysts, the superior basicity of Mg/NiAl led to the highest CO2/CH4 ratio (1.63). Moreover, metallic nickel dispersion and surface area values were significantly larger for the coprecipitated assay as compared to the impregnated one (DNi 0: 6% vs 1% and SNi 0: 8.0 vs 0.8 m2 Niº/g). This behaviour would explain the improved hydrogenation activity of the spinel-derived catalysts, as pointed out by the composition of the liquid products, as well as their enhanced APR activity."
10,Conclusions,"Four nickel-based catalysts were synthesized and characterized. Their performance in the aqueous-phase reforming (APR) of glycerol was evaluated at 235 ºC and 35 bar, in a ﬁxed-bed up-flow reactor. One of the catalysts was synthesized by impregnation of nickel over γ-alumina (Ni/Al), another by co-precipitation to form stoichiometric spinel (NiAl) and the rest by Ce and Mg doping on NiAl support (Ce/NiAl and Mg/NiAl). The characterization results indicated that nickel strongly anchored to the NiAl2O4 structure what improved the nickel dispersion upon reduction. This was reflected by the superior catalytic activity of NiAl with respect to Ni/Al, in terms of glycerol conversion and hydrogen selectivity. Addition of Mg and Ce limited the growth of metallic Ni particles upon reduction and increased the basicity. In general, Ce promoted the reducibility of the nickel species while Mg addition caused the opposite effect due to Ni-Mg interactions. Both promoters slightly increased the catalyst selectivity to hydrogen. The main difference was reported in the glycerol conversion. It notably increased after Ce doping whereas it was slightly lowered after Mg addition. Also, the promoted catalysts achieved a lower CO/CO2 and CO/H2 ratio in the gas-phase products, indicating their ability to promote WGS reaction. Regarding the obtained liquid-phase products, spinel-based catalysts showed a similar product distribution, being propylene glycol the most abundant product. XRD of the spent Ni/Al catalysts indicated the formation of boehmite. Also, it was found that both promoters improved the stability of the textural properties under APR conditions. Leaching of metals is likely the main issue to be addressed in future investigations in order to seek for stable catalysts that allow liquid-phase biomass upgrading."
