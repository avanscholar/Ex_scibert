0,Introduction,"Development of biomass conversion processes for generation of renewable commodity chemicals and biofuels can provide rural economic development and alleviate conflicts over fossil-derived resources, including the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Numerous examples of processes aided by metabolic engineering and synthetic biology have been described over the last decade for development of efficient microbial processes (Liao et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2018b,a) and novel enzyme cascade systems (Dueber et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2013a,b,c; Park et al., 2014) for bioconversion of non-food biomass feedstocks to biofuels and other valuable chemicals. Microalgae, because of its growth rate and favorable biochemical composition, limited competition for agricultural land use, and the ability to utilize CO2 and rapidly improve strains (Hannon et al., 2010), is a potentially exciting addition to the biomass feedstock portfolio. Moreover, there is increasing commercial interest in bioproducts production from microalgae, including many valuable secondary metabolites or co-products (Eonseon et al., 2006; Ye et al., 2008). A major hurdle for transitioning microalgae from a potential feedstock to large-scale application is the relatively high cost of producing the biomass compared to conventional supplies, such as municipal, agricultural, and forest residues. Two major approaches are being considered to improve the economic feasibility of microalgae based bioproducts; one is to maximize the rate, yield, and titers of products from microalgae biomass through bioprocess optimization (Eonseon et al., 2003; Melis and Happe, 2001). The second strategy is to minimize costs in cultivation hardware, land and water use, nutrient supply, and harvesting and dewatering in microalgae cultivation (Hannon et al., 2010). Among the biomass production parameters, the major nutrient requirement for microalgae growth has been identified as a predominant cost contributor (Liu et al., 2013a,b,c). Nutrients including phosphorous, nitrogen, iron, sulfur and potassium are required for microalgae cultivation in addition to water, light and CO2 (Juneja et al., 2013). Large-scale cultivation of microalgae for biobased commodities production will significantly impact these already limited supplies of nutrients and compete with agricultural needs as these nutrients are also used as fertilizers. As an example, phosphate is a non-renewable resource; if algal biofuels are to completely replace petroleum in the USA, more phosphate than the total amount currently mined annually would be required (Hannon et al., 2010). Furthermore, nitrogen fixation by the Haber-Bosch process requires energy inputs of 46 kJ/mol (Giddey et al., 2017), reducing the energy yield of processes for which artificial nitrogen fixation is required. Therefore, effective solutions for recycling nutrients from the residues of biomass for subsequent use is required to minimize the cost of nutrient supplies and to meet the needs of large scale microalgae production. While the concept of nutrient recycling is simple and could result in significant economic and environmental benefits, most previous studies have focused on nutrient removal from nutrient-rich wastewater or agricultural runoff by microalgae as the indirect method of nutrient reuse (Cai et al., 2013). Recently, Davis et al. (2015) reported the use of struvite (NH4MgPO4), a major precipitate in wastewater streams, for replacement of nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) nutrients for microalgae cultivation in lab- and pilot-scale open raceway ponds. Struvite has been shown to have high nutrient uptake efficiency by microalgae cultures and has been demonstrated to be a functional replacement for conventional N and P sources as well as trace metals. In addition to the efforts for nutrient reuse from external sources, microalgae biomass by itself is rich in N and P. Organic N and P is found in a variety of biological substances in microalgae, such as nucleic acids, proteins, peptides and enzymes (Lowrey et al., 2016), which could potentially be extracted and recycled. In a more recent study, a simple and effective osmotic shock and digestion technique has been developed to extract cellular phosphorus from harvested microalgae biomass. The remineralized phosphorus has shown to support the same level of algal growth as standard nutrients with no growth inhibitory effect (unpublished data). In this work, remineralization of cellular nitrogen from microalgae biomass during the process of pretreatment and biochemical conversion of algae hydrolysates was demonstrated. The protein content of microalgae constitutes a considerable portion of the biomass, comprising up to 70% of the mass balance (Lowrey et al., 2016), which accounts for approximately 90% of cellular nitrogen (Laurens et al., 2012). Proteins in the microalgae biomass can be hydrolyzed by acid or enzymatic treatments to release free amino acids as well as ammonium into solution (Romero García et al., 2012). Liu et al. (2017) recently developed an engineered E. coli co-culture that can simultaneously convert the carbohydrate and protein fractions of pretreated microalgae hydrolysates into C4 and C5 fusel alcohols. During the pretreatment and fermentation process, algal protein was hydrolyzed to free amino acids and short chain oligomers which were further converted to fusel alcohols through the upregulation of amino acid catabolism pathways in the engineered E. coli strains. Through the pretreatment and fermentation process, cellular nitrogen was released in the form of ammonium. By combining the separate pools of remineralized phosphorus and ammonium at the appropriate pH, struvite spontaneously forms and precipitates, providing for efficient recapture of the nutrients for subsequent recycling in secondary microalgae cultivation. Thus, a closed-loop platform for commodity chemical production with integrated nutrient recycling of cellular nitrogen and phosphorus from algal residues for sustainable microalgae cultivation scale-up has been established in this study (Fig. 1 ). This finding should facilitate establishment of microalgae as a promising environmentally and economically viable platform for biofuel refineries and may have fruther economic impacts for production of other microalgae-based bioproducts in a biorefinery context. Microchloropsis salina was used as the model strain in this study since it has been identified as one of the preferred microalgae strains by the National Alliance for Advanced Biofuels and Bioproducts (NAABB) (Lammers et al., 2017)."
1,Material and methods,
2,Modeling of struvite formation,"2.1 Modeling of struvite formation The potential for producing struvite or related mineral forms is dependent on the thermodynamic stability of the solution phase. PHREEQC, an open-source computer program that provides a range of calculations in aqueous and mineral phases to compute multiphase equilibrium (Parkhurst and Appelo, 2013, 1999), was employed in this study. In this context, the MINTEQ database, version 4, supplied with the PHREEQC distribution (Allison et al., 1991) were primarily used. These calculations provided solubility limits and thus the separations potential by precipitation that can be attained from a given process yield. The reactants for precipitation can be thought of as Mg2+, NH4 + and PO4 3-. The overall solubility product for struvite based on ion activities has been measured by a number of groups to be in the range of 10−12–10−14 (Bhuiyan et al., 2007; Doyle and Parsons, 2002; Koutsoukos et al., 2007; Ohlinger et al., 1998). For this study, pKsp = −13.26 was used based on activities of the reactants Mg2+, NH4 + and PO4 3−. The solubility of the product was measured over a range of temperatures up to 50 °C and it has been shown that there is significant variability in these measurements (Bhuiyan et al., 2007). Optimum precipitation for struvite in the pH 8 to 11 range is associated with the conversion of soluble phosphate to PO4 3− with increasing pH and the conversion of Mg2+ to Mg(OH)2 and NH4 + to NH3 with increasing pH. The pH was induced to vary in calculations by simulated addition of NaOH."
3,Algal strain and culture conditions,"2.2 Algal strain and culture conditions M. salina (CCMP 1776) was obtained from the National Center for Marine Algae and Microbiota (Boothbay Harbor, ME) and Texas A&M University. M. Salina cultures were inoculated with late-log phase axenic cultures at a starting near-IR optical density of 0.05–0.10 in a MC1000 multicultivator apparatus (Photon Systems Instruments). The cultures were maintained in ESAW medium (Harrison et al., 1980) under constant light (100 µmol photons m−2 S-1) and temperature (21 °C). Cell numbers were counted using a Coulter Z2 particle counter (Beckman coulter Inc, CA)."
4,Struvite replacement in microalgae medium,"2.3 Struvite replacement in microalgae medium For the struvite replacement experiment, struvite was acquired as the purified hydrate (NH4MgPO4·6H2O) (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) and in crude form as wastewater stone (the generous gift of Gary Westlund, Guard Products, Inc.). Experimental media using struvite as the N and P sources were generated by dissolving struvite in the artificial seawater with supplementation of up to 1.65 mM sodium nitrate (3× excess) and with or without the trace metals and vitamins. The control culture medium was L1 enriched artificial seawater adjusted to pH 8.0 (Davis et al., 2015)."
5,Algal biomass harvesting and phosphate extraction,2.4 Algal biomass harvesting and phosphate extraction M. salina biomass was dewatered by centrifugation and was concentrated to ∼20% (w/v) solids. Following dewatering the biomass was osmotically shocked by rapidly resuspending it in ice-cold 40 mM 2-(N-Morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer (pH 6.0) at a final concentration of 2% (w/v) solids. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h with shaking at 120 rpm. The biomass solids were subsequently pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C and the supernatant containing the soluble phosphate was obtained. The biomass obtained after phosphorus extraction was used for the subsequent pretreatment and fermentation.
6,Microchloropsis salina biomass pretreatment and co-culture fermentation,"2.5 Microchloropsis salina biomass pretreatment and co-culture fermentation M. salina biomass was pretreated as previously reported (Liu et al., 2017). Briefly, the biomass was mixed with 10% dilute sulfuric acid to a final concentration of 7.5% (w/v) solid. Then the mixture was incubated in the 90 °C water bath for 5 h and neutralized with Ca(OH)2 solids until pH reached 6.5. The resulting slurry was subsequently hydrolyzed with 1.5 mg/ml Pronase (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) following the manufacture’s protocol. After enzymatic digestion, the slurry was centrifuged and the supernatant was sterilized by filtration through the 0.22 µm PTFE membrane (Fisher Scientific, CA). The pretreated and enzymatically digested algae hydrolysate with no additional supplements was used directly as the fermentation medium for fusel alcohol production. E. coli strains AY3 and BLF2 were inoculated in 10 mL LB medium separately. The overnight culture was centrifuged and the final cell pellets were re-suspended into 0.5–1 mL hydrolysates respectively and were both adjusted to the same OD600. Then BLF2 and AY3 cells were inoculated at a 1:4 ratio at a final concentration of 20% (v/v) into 20 mL algae hydrolysates supplemented with 100 µg/mL ampicillin, 34 µg/mL chloramphenicol, and 25 µg/mL spectinomycin. The culture was incubated at 37 °C, 250 rpm and induced with 1 mM IPTG when OD600 reached 0.8. The flasks were cap-sealed and cultured for another 48 h at 30 °C, 250 rpm for fusel alcohol production. At the end of fermentation, the cells were pelleted down and the supernatant was collected. The alcohol mixture produced by the co-culture fermentation was analyzed by HPLC and GC–MS as previously described (Liu et al., 2017)."
7,Microalgae growth assays,"2.6 Microalgae growth assays For lab-scale growth assays, chlorophyll optical densities (OD680nm) and near-IR optical densities were collected by the MC1000 multi-cultivator apparatus at 10 min intervals during each assay. The spectrophotometric data was despiked to correct for refractive artifacts resulting from aeration bubbles by adapting a method previously described for correcting noise imparted on velocimeter data in bubbly flow (Mori et al., 2007). The data was then used to generate growth curves of M. salina for struvite replacement. At various time points during the microalgae growth, aliquots of the cultures were also taken and serially diluted and the relative chlorophyll a fluorescence was measured at the excitation wavelength of 415 nm and absorption at 685 nm by a microplate reader. The data was used to generate growth curves of M. salina in various media formulations."
8,Struvite formation and characterization,"2.7 Struvite formation and characterization Phosphorus extracted solution from M. salina biomass was mixed with fermentation broth or 200 mM NH4Cl reagent and the pH of the mixture was adjusted to 8.5–9.0. The mixture was incubated with rotation at room temperature overnight and centrifuged down to collect the precipitates. The precipitates were washed three times and dried at 50 °C for further analysis. The precipitates that formed were analyzed for crystallographic confirmation of the struvite mineral lattice. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a PANalytical Empyrean diffractometer equipped with a PIXcel3D detector and operated at 40 kV and 40 kA using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). A reflection-transmission spinner was used as a sample holder and the spinning rate was set at 4 rpm. The patterns were collected in the 2θ range of 10–90°, and the step size was 0.039°. The Rietveld refinement was performed using the software package HighScore Plus. The elemental composition analysis of the precipitated material was performed by Micro Analysis, Inc. The elemental abundance of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) were measured by a CHNS Elemental Analyzer; oxygen (O) was analyzed by pyrolysis. The ash free dry weight of the product was also determined. A ceramic crucible was pre-ashed in furnaces at 550 °C for 2 h and allowed to cool in a nitrogen gas chamber for 10 min. The struvite samples were placed in the crucibles and dried in a 100 °C oven for 24 h. The percentage weight loss was calculated to determine the % solids of the sample. The sample was then moved to a 550 °C furnace and ashed for 24 h. The estimation of ash free dry weight is achieved through subtracting the weight of material remaining after ignition from the dry weight of the starting material."
9,Phosphate and ammonia determination,"2.8 Phosphate and ammonia determination Soluble phosphate in the solution was determined by the Phosphate Assay Kit ab65622 (Abcam, Inc., MA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Ammonia was determined by Nitrogen-Ammonia Reagent Set, TNT, AmVer (Salicylate), Low Range (Hach, Inc., Co)."
10,M. salina growth utilizing recycled phosphorus and nitrogen,2.9 M. salina growth utilizing recycled phosphorus and nitrogen Control cultures of M. salina were supplied with ESAW medium without N and P supplement or ESAW medium with 1.1 mM nitrate (2× excess) and 1.65 mM phosphate (3× excess). Recycled nutrient cultures were supplied with the ESAW medium supplemented with the struvite formed from remineralized phosphate and ammonia reagent or from remineralized phosphate and fermentation liquor. The cultures were grown in the multi-cultivator and time interval samples were taken to determine the cell numbers by measuring the relative units of the chlorophyll a fluorescence intensity of the cultures.
11,Results and discussion,
12,Struvite formation modelling,"3.1 Struvite formation modelling Struvite precipitation will occur when the solution concentrations exceed the solubility of the product. These limits were estimated using solution equilibrium computed with the PHREEQC software. The solubility of phosphate and ammonium in nominal seawater (total magnesium at 52 mM) is shown in Fig. 2 for saturated struvite conditions. This shows that the solubility limit is reached for nutrient concentrations (on the order of 10 mM concentration) that are attainable in nutrient recycling. In Fig. 2, the minimal solubility in the vicinity of pH = 9 is evident and adjusting the pH should enhance yields. If ammonium concentrations are substantially greater than phosphate concentrations as should occur given the elemental ratio of N to P found in algal biomass, a higher degree of efficiency in phosphate removal can be expected. In the latter case, while the fraction of ammonium removed will be smaller, the actual quantity removed, in proportion to the phosphate, is greater. The diagram in Fig. 2 shows the window of opportunity for using struvite requires nutrient concentrations in the range of 1–10 millimolar and pH approaching 9. The diagram in Fig. 2 was created by simulating the dissolution of struvite in sea water along with the similar dissolution of struvite in seawater to which 50 mM of ammonia has been added. The ammonia concentrations produced by the fermentation process described in Section 3.3 are several times larger, so mixing of the fermentation liquor with the phosphate extraction supernatant readily attain these concentrations. The prediction of struvite formation by the model is affected by the presence of other salts and organic acids in the solution. For example, the struvite formation can be inhibited by the presence of calcium since it can form calcium phosphates, which competes with struvite precipitation. The complexation between organic acids and Mg2+/NH4 + (Song et al., 2014) may also interfere with struvite formation under certain fermentation conditions."
13,Struvite can support microalgae growth by providing nutrients in algal culture,"3.2 Struvite can support microalgae growth by providing nutrients in algal culture To study whether algae biomass derived struvite could support subsequent M. salina growth (by provision of the N and P nutrients), algal growth in standard (L1) media and the media supplemented with struvite was compared. Struvite was acquired as the purified hydrate NH4MgPO4·6H2O and crude form as wastewater stone. Microalgae growth in the multicultivator was determined by measuring chlorophyll a absorbance (Juneja et al., 2013). M. salina cultured using crude struvite for full phosphorus replacement and a 1:1 N/P ratio replacement of nitrogen, without addition of vitamin and trace metals, were found to be more productive than that cultured in the L1 medium (Fig. 3 ), suggesting that struvite could provide major N/P nutrients and other cofactors, such as trace metals, for microalgae growth, which is in agreement with the previous study (Davis et al., 2015). M. salina cultured using crude and purified struvite for full phosphorus replacement with supplementation of vitamin and trace metals had similar cell densities during the growth, and both conditions produced more robust cell growth than that in the medium prepared by crude struvite without supplements (Fig. 3), indicating that the addition of vitamin and trace metals facilitated M. salina growth. These results confirmed that struvite could replace the major N/P nutrients in the culture and support the regrowth of M. salina."
14,Fusel alcohol production and cellular nitrogen remineralization,"3.3 Fusel alcohol production and cellular nitrogen remineralization The major pools of organic nitrogen in microalgae biomass are proteins and nucleic acids. Microalgae proteins contain about 0.16 g nitrogen per g dry weight while RNA and DNA contain about 0.155 and 0.16 g nitrogen per g dry weight respectively, according to the elemental composition. In addition, a small fraction of organic nitrogen is also present in chlorophylls a, b and c, and N-containing osmolytes (López et al., 2010). An E. coli consortium for conversion of both the carbohydrate and protein fractions of the algae hydrolysates into C4 and C5 fusel alcohols was previously developed (Liu et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2016). After dilute-acid pretreatment of 7.5% (w/v) M. salina biomass, M. salina hydrolysates were digested with Pronase to complete hydrolysis of the proteins to free amino acids and short chain oligomers which can be utilized by the protein conversion strain in the E. coli co-culture. At the end of fermentation, 3.8 g/L fusel alcohol titers were produced from the M. salina hydrolysates, corresponding to 62.0% isobutanol and 19.7% isopentanol (2-methyl-1-butanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol) (Fig. 4 B). 24.3% of the total proteins in the hydrolysates were converted to fusel alcohol products and a total of 176.5 mM ammonia was produced during fermentation, with 74.5 mM produced during the pretreatment process, which is depicted in Fig. 4A. The ammonia recovery yield is 2.35 mM/g algae biomass. Therefore, the co-culture fermentation not only produced fusel alcohols as a potential commodity chemical or biofuel product from M. salina hydrolysates, but also liberated cellular nitrogen from the microalgae biomass in the form of ammonium. In the engineered E. coli co-culture, which incorporated a carbohydrate conversion strain and a protein conversion strain, the protein conversion strain AY3 is able to utilize amino acids as carbon source and convert them to fusel alcohols through the deamination and 2-keto acid metabolic pathways where nitrogen in the algal proteins was released as ammonia during the biochemical reactions (Liu et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2016). The ammonium-assimilation genes in AY3 were deleted in order to prevent ammonia re-uptake and drive the nitrogen flux toward deamination and fusel alcohol production (Huo et al., 2011). Therefore, ammonium formed during the reaction was released into solution and could not be re-utilized by the cells, which simultaneously increases the fusel alcohol yield while providing for ammonia recovery from the fermentation process. However, the remineralization efficiency of the cellular nitrogen from the algae biomass was limited by the protein conversion efficiency of the hydrolysates by the E. coli co-culture. Further engineering of the protein conversion strain in the co-culture to increase the protein conversion efficiency during fermentation could potentially increase nitrogen recovery yield since ammonia is the co-product during the process of protein conversion and fusel alcohol production."
15,Struvite formation from the algae fermentation liquor and remineralized phosphate,"3.4 Struvite formation from the algae fermentation liquor and remineralized phosphate Our previous study showed that up to 70% of total cellular P could be obtained from osmotically-shocked but non-denatured M. salina biomass using mild incubation conditions (unpublished data). As shown in Fig. 5 A, 7.6 mM phosphate was liberated in the solution after phosphorus extraction from 2% (w/v) M. salina biomass, corresponding to 0.38 mM/g algae biomass. More ammonia (2.35 mM/g biomass) has been extracted from the biomass than phosphate, which is consistent with the higher amount of N than P in microalgae biomass (Davis et al., 2015). It has been shown that struvite (NH4MgPO4·6H2O) can be formed with purity levels up to 95% when using seawater and brine as the Mg sources (Liu et al., 2013a,b,c). Since seawater contains 52 mM Mg2+, 5.2 mM Mg2+ can be expected in the phosphorus extracted solution, which is 0.26 mM/g algae biomass. No additional Mg2+ is expected to be provided by the fermentation broth. Upon combining 168 mL remineralized phosphate solution (7.6 mM) and 12 mL fermentation liquor (176.5 mM ammonia), which provides an excess of ammonium relative to phosphate, and Mg2+ from the seawater, precipitates appeared in the solution when the pH was adjusted to about 8.5. After incubating the mixture overnight, the soluble phosphate in the solution decreased to 1.2 mM. As a control experiment, the remineralized phosphate solution was also mixed with 200 mM ammonia reagent and it showed that 2.3 mM soluble phosphate remained in the solution after the reaction and the rest was precipitated out. From the mass balance diagram (Fig. 5B), 0.26 mM struvite/g algae biomass could be produced from the process. The result suggested that fermentation liquor could provide sufficient quantity of ammonium to be recovered as precipitates with remineralized phosphate from M. salina biomass. Structural characterization of the precipitates confirmed that the crystallized struvite was the dominant product of the precipitates. XRD analysis showed the mineral lattice of struvite in the material which belongs to the orthorhombic space group Pmn2 1, with repeat unit lengths of a = 6.926 (1) Å, b = 6.126 (1) Å and c = 11.187 (2) Å and preferred orientations {0 0 1} and {1 1 1} (Supplementary Data). The unit cell parameters are consistent with those reported in the literature (Prywer et al., 2012). The compositional analysis further confirmed that the precipitates that were formed had the chemical formula of NH4MgPO4·6H2O. As shown in Table 1 , the weight percent (w/w) of each element N, H, P, O of the formed product was very similar to the theoretical values calculated based on NH4MgPO4·6H2O. Mg consisted 7.4% of the product, which is 25% lower than the calculated number (9.9%). This suggests that other cation ions such as Ca2+ may also form the insoluble product with PO4 3− and co-precipitated with the crude struvite. This may also explain the higher ash free dry weight of the formed products (26.9%) than the expected value from NH4MgPO4·6H2O (13.1%). Based on the calculated mass balance, Mg2+ is limiting during the struvite formation (Fig. 5B) and supplementation of extra Mg2+ externally could increase the yield of struvite and prevent the formation of calcium phosphate. These data suggested that N and P were able to be efficiently recovered from microalgae biomass in the form of struvite through the reaction of remineralized phosphate from microalgae residues and ammonium in the fermentation liquor along with the residual Mg2+ from the biomass and seawater based algae cultivation medium."
16,Nutrient recycling for microalgae growth,"3.5 Nutrient recycling for microalgae growth The struvite that was formed from the remineralized phosphate and ammonia from M. salina biomass was used to replace the total P and an equimolar amount of N in the medium for secondary M. salina cultivation. From the growth curves of M. salina (Fig. 6 ), microalgae grown in the medium prepared by the crude struvite formed from remineralized phosphate and fermentation liquor or ammonia reagent have very similar growth rates and cell numbers during the growth course as in the ESAW medium supplemented with 2 × N and 3 × P, as indicated by the relative chlorophyll fluorescence intensity of the cultures. M. salina grown in ESAW medium without N or P supplements had much lower growth rate than those grown in the standard media, confirming that the supply of N and P nutrients are necessary for culture of microalgae. The results demonstrated that the recovered phosphate and ammonia from microalgae biomass, in the form of struvite, could provide the major N/P nutrient needed for microalgae regrowth. Moreover, no indication of carryover of deleterious compounds was observed in the algae cultivation trials. Precipitation of struvite both concentrates and separates N and P from the medium and bioconversion products in a relatively pure form, which avoids accumulation of potential inhibitors for microalgae growth from the phosphorus extraction and fermentation process. Similarly, the process also eliminates introduction of organic contaminants from the fermentation liquor that can be used as carbon source for heterotrophic microorganisms during microalgae cultivation, thereby introducing microbial contamination. Other benefits of recovering N and P in the form of struvite include the ease of transportation and handling logistics for nutrient recycling, cost reduction by preventing luxury uptake of nutrients by the algae (Powell et al., 2011), and versatility for applications beyond algae cultivation, including sustainability benefits associated with reduced runoff because of struvite’s slow release properties (Everaert et al., 2018). Major N/P nutrients are a costly and potentially unsustainable input for large scale microalgae biomass production. Therefore, the potential for nutrient recycling is thought to be essential for scale-up of microalgae cultivation for biofuel and commodity bioproducts applications. Nutrient recycling concepts have been demonstrated in the processing of algae residual biomass conversion by anaerobic digestion (Biller et al., 2015) and hydrothermal processing (López Barreiro et al., 2013; Tian et al., 2014). Anaerobic digestion involves the decomposition of organic material of algal residuals by anaerobic bacteria to produce ammonia and phosphate which can be recycled as N/P nutrients. In this case, methane in the biogas is the targeted biofuel product. In the hydrothermal liquefaction process, biomass is converted using sub-critical (300–400 °C) water to generate a liquid bio-crude which is further upgraded to fuels by catalytic hydrothermal treatment (Biller et al., 2015). In this case, the process water is rich in nutrients and could be recycled for algae growth. However, the water phase contained chemicals such as phenols, fatty acids and nickel that could significantly inhibit algae growth (Biller et al., 2012), accumulate in algae cultivations with prolonged use, and contribute to contamination by heterotrophs; therefore requiring special care for its use. The work presented here is to our knowledge the first study that demonstrates a closed loop biocatalysis-based process using microalgae biomass with integrated nutrient recycling for subsequent algae growth. There are several advantages associated with the platform established here: 1) the remineralization of phosphorus and nitrogen from algae biomass involves very mild conditions and the biological conversion of algae hydrolysates into biofuels provide an environmental friendly closed-loop process; 2) the higher carbon alcohols –isobutanol (C4) and isopentanol (C5) produced from the microalgae biomass by the engineered E. coli co-culture can be used as drop-in liquid fuels or commodity chemical products, dependent on various economic factors; 3) the ability to recycle the major nutrients from algal waste substantially reduces the cost and sustainability concerns associated with major nutrient supply in microalgae biomass production scale-up. The fusel alcohol products generated in this study have been shown to have higher energy density and compatibility with gasoline, including lower water solubility and corrosivity, than bioethanol (C2) (Sarathy et al., 2014), and are therefore being seriously considered as biofuel candidates to replace fossil fuels. Finally, application of precipitated struvite to provide the phosphorus and nitrogen requirements for microalgae cultivation showed no inhibitory growth effects in multiple rounds of regrowth. The integrated biorefinery platform developed here, which includes microalgae biomass production and pretreatment, fusel alcohol production, and recovery and recycling of N/P for microalgae cultivation (Fig. 1) should significantly improve the sustainability and techno-economic feasibility of biofuel production from microalgae feedstocks."
17,Conclusions,"This study demonstrates closed-loop fusel alcohol production from microalgae biomass with recycling of major nutrients to support subsequent algae cultivation, which establishes a sustainable platform for fuels and commodity chemical production from microalgae. A mixture of 3.8 g/L fusel alcohols were produced from M. salina hydrolysates by the E. coli co-culture. Concomitant release of cellular nitrogen as ammonium was observed during the pretreatment and fermentation process, and phosphate was liberated by osmotic shock. Remineralized nitrogen and phosphorus was recovered in the form of struvite and was recycled as N/P nutrients for microalgae regrowth, with no inhibitory effects observed from multiple cycles."
