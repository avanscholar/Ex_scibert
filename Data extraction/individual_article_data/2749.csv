0,Introduction,"Nowadays, with the booming world economy, industrial progress has greatly advanced human civilization, but this has been at the cost of the energy crisis and global warming.[1–4] Therefore, clean and sustainable energy should be urgently developed to solve these problems.[5–8] Hydrogen energy has been studied as the most promising replacement for fossil fuels for decades owing to its high energy density and pollution-free products.[9,10] Currently, hydrogen acquisition still mainly depends on the consumption of fossil fuels, which is contrary to the original intention.[11–14] Electrocatalytic water splitting is a sustainable method for hydrogen production, and thus, it could be among the most promising future technologies.[15,16] According to studies on the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), noble metals such as Pt and Pd are the most efficient electrocatalysts because of the moderate bond energy between the hydrogen atoms and the metal surface.[17,18] However, the expensive cost of noble metals has strictly hindered large-scale applications.[19,20] Therefore, the search for high-activity and low-cost electrocatalysts has aroused considerable interest worldwide.[21] In the research of non-noble catalysts, the self-supporting catalysts can be used directly as electrodes in HER, which exhibits a bright prospect for industrialization Whereas, plenty of works have focused on the activity improvement of the catalyst itself, but ignored the importance of the substrate. For example, MoS2 is extensively studied for catalytic HER but the intrinsically poor conductivity of MoS2 poses a significant limitation to its adoption in mature applications.[22–24] Therefore, loading MoS2 on conductive substrates, such as carbon cloth,[25] Mo plate, [26] Au foil,[27] and Ni foam,[28] is an effective way to accelerate the charge transfer. Cui’s group developed a novel method for the vertical growth of MoS2 or MoSe2 on Mo plate, the vertical growth of MoS2 or MoSe2 exposed more active edges and the Mo plate increase conductivity of the electrode, resulting in fascinating catalytic HER activities.[26] Among the various types of metal matrices, Ni foam has been widely used as a matrix to support catalysts because of its high porosity, which not only provides more space for catalysts growth, but also maximizes contact with the electrolyte, thereby improving the catalytic efficiency [29–32]. Typically, transition metal chalcogenide (TMC), such as MoS2, can be easily decorated on Ni foam to form a self-supporting electrode for HER, which has been studied extensively due to its excellent performance [29,30,33–40]. In general, an Ni3S2 intermediate can be synthesized during the preparation of MoS2 deposited on Ni foam to obtain MoS2/Ni3S2 heterostructures. The effect of different types of sulfur sources on MoS2/Ni3S2@Ni foam catalyst has been systematically studied, and thioacetamide (TAA) was found to be the best raw material [29]. Yang et al. developed hierarchical MoS2/Ni3S2 heteronanorods on Ni foam via a facile one-pot hydrothermal synthesis, which exhibited excellent performances for the HER, oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and overall water splitting in alkaline media [30]. This study was further refined by adjusting the raw materials to realize the phase transformation of MoS2 from 2H to 1T, which decorated the top of the Ni3S2 nanorods (NRs) with 2H/1T-MoS2. The innumerable needle-like NRs with an “MoS2-hat” were arranged vertically and uniformly, which not only facilitated the exposure of active sites, but also promoted the release of the generated gas, resulting in outstanding catalytic performance [31]. Zhang et al. prepared MoS2/Ni3S2 on Ni foam and calculated the chemisorption of hydrogen by density functional theory (DFT) simulation, and thus both experimentally and theoretically demonstrated the promotion of hydrogen evolution by the MoS2/Ni3S2 hybrid [32]. Despite the significant progress in coupling MoS2/Ni3S2 with Ni foam, there are still several problems that hinder the practical application of MoS2/Ni3S2@Ni foam electrodes. In particular, from the perspective of large-scale catalytic hydrogen production, Ni foam-based self-supporting catalyst cannot be directly used as an industrial electrode because of its weak mechanical strength and poor processibility [41]. As a consequence, the rational design and preparation of substrates with porous structure and excellent mechanical strength are critical to promoting the commercial application of hydrogen evolution reactions. In this work, Ni powder was sintered to a porous Ni metal matrix with controlled structure via low-temperature figuration by spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique, and high-temperature consolidation by atmosphere sintering, as illustrated in Fig. 1 a and Figure S1 . This powder metallurgy is beneficial for the formation of a three-dimensional (3D) porous and connected Ni metal matrix. Due to the mature research foundation of MoS2/Ni3S2 NRs decorated on Ni substrates, we, therefore, try to fabricate a self-supporting catalytic electrode with the catalyst of MoS2/Ni3S2 NRs decorated on the matrix of the as-prepared sintered Ni metal. Herein, MoS2/Ni3S2 NRs with hierarchical structures were in-situ grew on the surface of sintered Ni metal matrix via sulfurization by hydrothermal synthesis (Fig. 1 a). The porous sintered Ni metal matrix-supported with the MoS2/Ni3S2 NRs displayed various advantages over Ni foam, including a tighter bonding strength between the decorated MoS2/Ni3S2 NRs and the matrix, better mechanical properties as well as superior stability and durability during the cycling, which may be adapted to different industrial requirements. We further discovered that the sintering temperature during the powder metallurgy process determined the morphology of the sintered Ni matrix and surface oxide states, which remarkably affect the growth of MoS2/Ni3S2 NRs. By optimizing the high sintering temperature, ordered nanorod arrays can be obtained on a matrix with well-distributed small oxide particles."
1,Results and discussion,"As shown in Fig. 1 a, a self-supporting catalytic electrode of NRs@Sintered Ni was prepared by figuration, consolidation and sulfurization. Firstly, Ni powder can be pre-sintered into loose, porous and integral Ni slab (Fig. 1 b) by SPS at low temperature. As shown in Fig. 1 b, Ni particles are connected and a 3D Ni network is formed after the SPS process. However, such Ni slab is fragile due to the weak cohesion between Ni particles ( Figure S2 ). Afterwards, during the following high-temperature atmosphere sintering process, Ni particles are consolidated and connected (Fig. 1 c), which increases cohesion between Ni particles and the mechanical strength of the sintered Ni slab (denoted Sintered NiX, where X is the sintering temperature). Finally, a hierarchical MoS2/Ni3S2 NRs@Sintered NiX (denoted NRs@Sintered NiX) electrode was synthesized by hydrothermal sulfurization reaction of sintered Ni matrix in the presence of Na2MoO4 and TAA. After this sulfurization reaction process, numerous NRs grow on the surface of sintered Ni matrix (Fig. 1 d). The diameter and thickness of NRs@Sintered NiX electrodes are 20 and 2 mm respectively. Photographs of the porous Ni slab (Fig. 1 e), Sintered Ni800 matrix (Fig. 1 f) and NRs@Sintered Ni800 (Fig. 1 g) are shown in Fig. 1 e-1g. Sintered Ni800 shows a metallic luster, indicating the formation of a bulk Ni matrix. The color of the Sintered Ni800 changes to black after sulfurization reaction, suggesting the Ni matrix is covered with MoS2/Ni3S2 and other Sintered NiX samples with different sintering temperatures display consistent results ( Figure S3 ). As a comparison, the same sulfurization reaction was performed on Ni foam to obtained the MoS2/Ni3S2 NRs@Ni foam electrode (denoted NRs@Ni foam). It is well known that Ni foam is widely used as a matrix for supporting the catalysts due to its high porosity, which can afford more places for the growth or decoration of catalysts. Therefore, porosity and the pore size distribution of Sintered Ni800 and Ni foam were measured by the mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) method. The Sintered Ni800 exhibits comparable porosity of 56.4% with Ni foam (60.9%). Meanwhile, the pore size of Sintered Ni800 is approximately 1.8 μm, which is much smaller than that of Ni foam (∼20 μm), as shown in Fig. 1 h, which is consistent with the morphology. Such a high porosity with a small pore size is beneficial to good mechanical strength. As a comparison illustrated in Fig. 1 i, the NRs@Sintered Ni800 shows the ultrahigh tensile strength of 158.77 MPa with 35.58% strain even under high loading of 404.87 N (the shape of the test sample was processed according to the size shown in Figure S4 ), while NRs@Ni foam exhibits poor tensile strength of 0.61 MPa with 7.17% strain under low loading of 9.93 N (Fig. 1 i inset). The tensile strength of NRs@Sintered Ni800 is nearly 260 times higher than that of NRs@Ni foam, indicating that the consolidation of Ni powder significantly increases the mechanical properties of Ni metal substrate. Such superior mechanical strength is critical for the practical application of large-scale catalytic hydrogen production. To investigate the influence of sintering temperature on the morphologies of Sintered Ni matrix and NRs@Sintered NiX, SEM images and corresponding elemental mapping of Sintered Ni matrices under different sintering temperatures (600 ∼ 900 °C) are shown in Fig. 2 a–2f. At a lower sintering temperature of 600 °C, as shown in Fig. 2 a and 2e, the Ni and O elements are homogeneously distributed on the surface of Sintered Ni600 matrix. As the increasing of the sintering temperature, mental Ni is remarkably consolidated into dense and connected 3D Ni networks. Small particles precipitate on the surface of the Sintered Ni matrix when the temperature increases to 800 °C (Fig. 2 c and 2g), and become bigger when the sintering temperature is 900 °C (Fig. 2 d and 2h). The elemental mapping analysis of the Sintered Ni(800 ∼ 900) matrices in Fig. 2 g and 2h identifies the particles growing on the surface of Sintered Ni matrix are NiO. Interestingly, the small NiO particles are evenly distributed and subdivide the metal surface into many well-proportioned areas, as shown in the yellow circles in Fig. 2 c. At a higher sintering temperature of 900 °C, the small NiO particles tend to agglomerate, and the separated areas are irregular. SEM images (Fig. 2 i–2l) have illustrated the morphologies of the NRs@Sintered Ni(600 ∼ 900), respectively. NRs generate on the surface of all the Sintered Ni matrices, but the size and distribution of the NRs largely vary between the different Sintered NiX matrices. Among them, NRs@Sintered Ni800 exhibits the most consistent size and uniform distribution of the MoS2/Ni3S2 NRs with the same orientation. In contrast, many large lumps on the surface of NRs@Sintered Ni600 are interspersed between the NRs with an irregular appearance. The elemental mapping shown in Figure S5 reveals these large-sized particles to be NiO. Besides, even though no big NiO particles are observed on the surface of NRs@Sintered Ni900, the orientation of NRs growth is random (Fig. 2 l), which is not beneficial for the exposure of catalytic active sites. Overall, NiO tends to form particles and become bigger gradually as the sintering temperature of the matrix increases. In the hydrothermal sulfurization process, the distribution and size of NiO particles on the Sintered Ni matrix significantly affect the growth of the NRs. Taking NRs@Sintered Ni600 as an example, since the NRs are grown from nickel metal, when a large amount of NiO covers the surface of the metal substrate, the uniform growth of NRs is restrained on the surface. The NRs are probably generated only from the cracks or gaps between NiO cover. For the Sintered Ni800 matrix, the small NiO particles on the surface of the sintered Ni matrix play an important role in limiting the growth of the NRs, which is similar to how “flowerpots” confine “plants” to appropriate areas. Typically, the MoS2/Ni3S2 “nano-plants” can grow with an ordered orientation and form a spectacular morphology due to the confinement effect of well-distributed small NiO particles “flowerpots”. In summary, the above results have clearly revealed that the morphology of sintered Ni matrix and their corresponding NRs@Sintered Ni electrodes can be precisely controlled by tuning the sintering temperature of sintered Ni matrix. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to elucidate the crystal phases of Sintered Ni800 matrix and NRs@Sintered Ni800 sample. As shown in Fig. 3 a. The main components of Sintered Ni800 matrix are Ni metal (JCPDF#04–0850) and NiO (JCPDF#78–0643). Other Sintered NiX (X = 600, 700 or 900) matrices also exhibit the same crystal phases ( Figure S6 a). After the hydrothermal sulfurization treatment, new peaks for Ni3S2 (JCPDF#85–1802) are observed, indicating the formation of Ni3S2 on Ni metal matrices. Likewise, the consistent results of other NRs@Sintered NiX (X = 600, 700 or 900) samples are confirmed, as illustrated in Figure S6 b. Notably, the Ni 2p and O 1s spectra show a large difference between the NRs@Sintered Ni600 and NRs@Sintered Ni800, as illustrated in Fig. 3 b and 3c. Peaks located at 853.88 and 871.73 eV are ascribed to Ni2+ 2p3/2 and Ni2+ 2p1/2 of NiO, and two peaks at 855.58 and 873.31 eV are attributed to Ni3+ 2p3/2 and Ni3+ 2p1/2 of Ni3S2. Both Ni3S2 and NiO characteristic peaks are obvious for the NRs@Sintered Ni600,[42] demonstrating the existence of NiO on the surface of NRs@Sintered Ni600, [43] while only Ni3S2 peaks are observed for the NRs@Sintered Ni800. The O 1s spectrum further confirms this result, where lattice O, corresponding to NiO, exists in NRs@Sintered Ni600. Although MoS2 is undetectable in the XRD result owing to its low content, Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 3 d) has detected the characteristic peaks of MoS2 and Ni3S2. The peaks at 197 cm−1, 224 cm−1, 336 cm−1, 351 cm−1, are associated with the Ni3S2 bands,[44] while the peaks at 375 cm−1 and 402 cm−1, can be attributed to the E1 2g and A1g vibrational modes of the MoS2.[45] The existence of MoS2 can be further evidenced via the XPS spectrum of the NRs@Sintered Ni800, which clearly shows the Mo and S peaks, as illustrated in Fig. 3 e and 3f. The peaks of Mo4+ 3d3/2 at 232.28 eV and Mo4+ 3d5/2 at 229.12 eV,[46,47] as well as the S2- 2p1/2 at 162.83 eV and S2- 2p3/2 at 161.53 eV,[48,49] are observed, confirming the existence of MoS2. The morphology of the NRs is observed through SEM, as displayed in Fig. 3 g, where the NRs are covered with innumerable wrinkle-like nanosheets and the NRs exhibit a length of nearly 1.5 μm and thickness of 80 to ∼ 250 nm (measured in Figure S7 ). TEM, elemental mapping and high-resolution TEM techniques were further employed to investigate the composition of the NRs (Fig. 3 h–k). From the elemental mapping shown in Fig. 3 h, the nanorod has clearly displayed the distribution of Ni, Mo and S elements. Ni element is mainly located in the middle of the nanorod, while Mo element is scattered around the nanorod, and S element is distributed uniformly throughout the nanorod, which can further prove the coexistence of both MoS2 and Ni3S2. When enlarging the yellow area in the TEM image (Fig. 3 i), it can be seen that the nanosheets adhered to the nanorod are two-dimensional (2D) MoS2, which is confirmed by the layer distance of 0.68 nm, corresponding to the (002) lattice planes of MoS2 (Fig. 3 j). Analysis of the lattice fringes inside the NRs in the high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 3 k) indicates the main component of the NRs to be the Ni3S2 phase. The interplanar spacings of 0.234 nm and 0.238 nm are attributed to the (−111) and (111) lattice planes of Ni3S2, respectively. The corresponding fast Fourier transform pattern further verifies that the angle between the two crystal planes is 70.5°, which is consistent with the calculated result. In summary, the growth process of MoS2/Ni3S2 NRs on sintered Ni matrix can be described as follows: As shown in Fig. 3 l, the uniformly distributed small NiO particles (purple spheres) have divided the Ni metal surface into many small-sized areas (yellow circles), which act like “flowerpots” for the proportional growth of MoS2/Ni3S2 NRs (green rods), resulting in regular arrays with a “grass-like” morphology, and the 2D lamellar MoS2 sheets (orange sheets) are decorated on the Ni3S2 NRs. The MoS2/Ni3S2 NRs have advantages as follows: (1) Ni3S2 can be used as a charge transfer bridge to efficiently accelerate the electrons from the matrix to MoS2; (2) MoS2 is vertically arranged on nickel sulfide NRs, showing many (002) crystal planes, which is conducive to the exposure of active sites, improving the HER activity; (3) Many nanorods grow vertically on the metal nickel matrix evenly and neatly, which maximizes the contact area between catalyst and electrolyte, while the generated gas is easy to escape quickly along the gap between rods. All the advantages of MoS2/Ni3S2 NRs may help to improve the HER performance. The hydrothermal reaction of the MoS2/Ni3S2 NRs grown on sintered Ni matrix may follow Eq. (1) below (the derivation can be found in the Supporting Information): (1) 2 N a 2 M o O 4 + 6 C H 3 C S N H 2 + 3 N i + 4 H 2 O = 2 M o S 2 + N i 3 S 2 + 4 C H 3 C O O N a + 2 C H 3 C O O N H 4 + 4 N H 3 The catalytic HER performances of the as-obtained sintered Ni800 matrix and NRs@Sintered Ni800 were tested using a typical three-electrode system in alkaline media (1.0 M KOH solution), while the NRs@Ni foam and a Pt plate were conducted as well for comparisons. As shown in Fig. 4 a, the Sintered Ni800 matrix exhibits better performance than that of Ni foam, as the overpotential of 251 mV is much lower than that of 338 mV. The overpotential of the NRs@Sintered Ni800 is significantly decreased after the sulfurization on the porous Sintered Ni800 matrix, which is close to the one of Pt plate, and superior performance can be attributed to the catalytic effect of well-oriented MoS2/Ni3S2 NRs. As the polarization for HER comparison is based on current density with the electrode geometrical surface area, while the current is dependent upon the actual electrochemical surface area. Therefore, a quantification of the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) was carried out by using the double-layer capacitances (Cdl) method. The cyclic voltammograms (CVs) with different scan rate from 10 mV s−1 to 100 mV s−1 was performed ( Figure S8 ) and the Cdl results can be obtained by plotting the current density variation (Δj = (ja − jc)/2, at 150 mV vs RHE), as displayed in Fig. 4 b. The NRs@Sintered Ni800 exhibits the highest Cdl of 166.87 mF cm−2, which is much more than the ones of Ni foam (3.66 mF cm−2), Sintered Ni800 (12.28 mF cm−2) and NRs@Ni foam (58.05 mF cm−2), indicating more active sites on the surface of NRs@Sintered Ni800. Meanwhile, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results of different electrodes are shown in Fig. 4 c. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) of NRs@Sintered Ni800 is lower than that of NRs@Ni foam, sintered Ni and Ni foam, indicating the NRs@Sintered Ni accelerate the electron transfer and ion diffusion. Moreover, HER performances of all the as-prepared self-supporting electrodes, including NRs@Sintered Ni(600 ∼ 900) samples, were conducted by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) technique, where the NRs@Sintered Ni800 electrode shows the best HER activity. As demonstrated in Fig. 4 d and inset, the overpotential of NRs@Sintered Ni800 for j values of −10 mA cm−2 is 56 mV, which is lower than that of other samples, including NRs@Sintered Ni900 (η10 = 72 mV), NRs@Sintered Ni700 (η10 = 94 mV), and NRs@Sintered Ni600 (η10 = 117 mV). The corresponding Tafel plots suggest the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism for the NRs@Sintered Ni800 sample with a Tafel slope of 82 mV dec−1 (Fig. 4 e). As expected, NRs@Sintered Ni900 electrode (93 mV dec−1), NRs@Sintered Ni700 electrode (107 mV dec−1), and NRs@Sintered Ni600 electrode (112 mV dec−1) exhibit inferior performances to that of NRs@Sintered Ni800 electrode, indicating that the morphology has a decisive effect on performance. A comparison for the catalytic HER performances of other self-supporting electrodes of MoS2 and Ni3S2 on Ni substrates reported in recent works is displayed in Table S1, which reveals the superior catalytic activity and stability of the as-obtained NRs@Sintered Ni800 electrode. The Nyquist plots demonstrate the electron transfer resistance in all the MoS2-decorated samples. Among them, the NRs@Sintered Ni800 electrode affords the lowest Rct, as shown in the simulated equivalent circuit data in Table S2, which indicates a faster electron transfer (Fig. 4 f). Moreover, the trend of the Nyquist plots is consistent with the order of the HER activities. Nyquist plots and equivalent circuits of the NRs@Sintered Ni(600 ∼ 900) samples at overpotentials of 60, 90, 120, and 150 mV also exhibit similar results ( Figure S9 ), where NRs@Sintered Ni800 electrode demonstrates the lowest Rct at different overpotentials. The superior electron transfer ability of NRs@Sintered Ni800 may be attributed to two reasons. On one hand, combined with the previous analysis, Ni3S2 NRs are serving as a “connection bridge” to deliver the charge quickly from the porous Ni metal substrate to the anchored MoS2 molecules, such that the vertically arranged MoS2 flakes with exposed active sites are efficiently utilized for catalysis. On the other hand, no obvious NiO is presented in the NRs@Sintered Ni800 electrode, which alleviates the hindrance of the electron transfer, resulting in relatively lower Rct values. In order to clarify the roles of each component played in HER, we designed a contrast experiment, where only TAA was added in the hydrothermal process to prepare the Ni3S2@Sintered Ni800 sample. As shown in Figure S10 , the Ni3S2 phase is confirmed via XRD pattern and Raman spectroscopy on the surface of Sintered Ni800. Moreover, SEM images and the corresponding elemental mapping analysis have suggested the uniform distribution of Ni and S ( Figure S11 ). Unfortunately, there are no obvious nanorods, but innumerable nanoparticle bulges appear, which may be due to the fact that the dosage of TAA is not well controlled, and it seems to be an interesting research in the future. As presented in Figure S12 a, the Ni3S2@Sintered Ni800 sample manifests poor HER activity with a relatively higher overpotential of 185 mV at 10 mA cm−2. However, the Rct of Ni3S2@Sintered Ni800 even outperformed that of NRs@Sintered Ni800 ( Figure S12 b), evidencing a faster electron transfer. By the ECSA analysis ( Figure S12 c and Figure S12 d), the Cdl of Ni3S2@Sintered Ni800 electrode (12.11 mF cm−2) is as low as the one of Sintered Ni800 matrix, indicating no more active sites appear on the surface of Ni3S2@Sintered Ni800 electrode after sulfurization. All the results have proved that, Ni3S2 can help to accelerate the electron transfer but can neither increase the active sites nor improve the catalytic activity. Fig. 4 g-i illustrate the durability and stability of the NRs@Sintered Ni800 sample and the NRs@Ni foam sample, as demonstrated by the resulting polarization curve after 5000 CV cycles and the chronoamperometry (CA) test at different overpotentials of 150 mV, 200 mV and 300 mV. Compared with the NRs@Ni foam sample, the NRs@Sintered Ni800 sample shows desirable HER durability as its Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve after 5000 CV cycles almost overlaps with the initial one (Fig. 4 g). During the CA test, the current density of the NRs@Ni foam electrode sharply decreases within 17 h, while the NRs@Sintered Ni800 sample displays a constant current density for 40 h (Fig. 4 g inset), evidencing an excellent stability, which can be beneficial for the industrial service. To further investigate the superior stability, long-term CA at higher potentials of 200 mV and 300 mV were performed, as the results are shown in Fig. 4 h. In spite of several slight fluctuations due to the change of new electrolyte, the current densities for HER are ultra-stable over 100 h. The excellent stability and durability of NRs@Sintered Ni800 are competitive among the researches of Ni-based self-supporting catalytic electrodes reported recently,[29,30,33–40] as demonstrated in Fig. 4 i. Ultra-high stability and long-term durability at relatively high potentials make NRs@Sintered Ni800 be a fascinating choice for industrial applications. Moreover, SEM images of the NRs@Sintered Ni800 sample after the 5000 CV cycles exhibit a similar morphology to that of the sample before the test (Fig. 4 h), as a result of the robust bonding strength between the NRs and the matrix, which may be the reason of fantastic durability. However, obvious cracks and exfoliation appeared on the surface of the NRs@Ni foam electrode after the cycling test (Fig. 4 g), indicating the poor bonding strength between the NRs and Ni foam, which leads to inferior stability and durability. In summary, the stability and durability of NRs@Sintered Ni800 can be attributed to the following three factors: (1) There is an extensive distribution of sites on the surface of the as-sintered porous Ni metal matrix with large porosity that can support sufficient MoS2/Ni3S2 hierarchical nanostructures and avoid durability degradation caused by the peeling of the catalytic material. (2) The uniform distribution and vertical arrangement of NRs determined by NiO confinement can facilitate the escape of as-generated bubbles, which greatly weakens the damage to the surface morphology caused by the impact of the bubbles. (3) The extremely low transfer resistance significantly reduced the energy loss during the reaction, making the HER more efficient and durable. The HER mainly involves three basic reactions; the Volmer, Heyrovsky, and Tafel reactions.[1,50] In alkaline electrolytes, the three reactions can be described as:[51] (2) V o l m e r : H 2 O + M + e - → M- H ads + O H - (3) Heyrovsky: M- H ads + H 2 O + e - → H 2 ↑ + O H - + M (4) Tafel: M- H ads + M- H ads → H 2 ↑ + 2M where Hads represents the hydrogen adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst. To further elucidate the activity enhancement mechanism and understand the influence of the various material interfaces on the chemisorption of hydrogen, DFT simulations were employed to calculate the H adsorption free energy (ΔGH*) on different facets, such as the (002) plane of MoS2 and the (111) plane of Ni3S2, as shown in Fig. 5 a. The calculation details are described in the Supporting Information. Neither MoS2 nor Ni3S2 possess an optimal ΔGH*, with inferior results of +2.039 eV for MoS2 and −0.896 eV for Ni3S2. However, a reduction in the ΔGH* value of −0.829 eV is found on the neighboring Mo sites after Ni doping in the Ni/MoS2 model. Meanwhile, the ΔGH* of the MoS2/Ni3S2 hybrid is greatly enhanced (+0.685 eV), demonstrating the positive effect of the heterostructure. Moreover, the ΔGH* of the Ni-doped MoS2/Ni3S2 hybrid is calculated to be the value closest to zero (−0.463 eV), indicating the most desirable hydrogen adsorption. Based on the calculated results and experimental data, it can be reasonably deduced that both the MoS2/Ni3S2 heterostructure and Ni-doped MoS2/Ni3S2 hybrid can strongly promote the HER process. The Tafel slope values suggest a Volmer − Heyrovsky mechanism, which means that H2O can easily obtain electrons and form Hads faster (see Fig. 5 b). Additionally, the hierarchical structure of the NRs and nanosheets provides a fast path for transporting electrons, allowing them to participate efficiently in catalytic reactions. Above all, the NRs@Sintered Ni electrode possesses more advantages than that of the NRs@Ni foam electrode, as the following three aspects: (1) Catalytic HER performance. Compared with the overpotential of NRs@Ni foam (156 mV), the NRs@Porous Ni electrode shows a lower value of 56 mV. Even at high overpotentials of 200 mV and 300 mV, the CA curves keep constant results over 100 h, demonstrating ultra-high stability and long-term durability. (2) Bonding strength between the decorated TMCs and the substrate. The surface morphology of NRs@Sintered Ni electrode remains after performing 5000 CV cycles. (3) Mechanical properties. Unlike the weak and fragile Ni foam-based electrode (almost no tensile strength value), the as-obtained NRs@Sintered Ni exhibits a sufficient tensile strength of 158.77 MPa, max load of 404.87 N, strain elongation of 35.58% and an elastic modulus of 489.38 MPa, according to the stress–strain curves and corresponding mechanical parameters displayed in Fig. 1, which allows more possibilities for industrial applications."
2,Conclusion,"In summary, the 3D sintered Ni metal matrix with large porosity and small pore size prepared by the SPS technique and high-temperature sintering not only has the rough surface and sufficient porosity to provide more sites for catalyst decorating, but also shows the potential for being mechanical processed. Sintered Ni matrix with controlled morphology can be obtained by optimizing the sintering temperature (800 °C). The confinement effect of the small NiO particles on the surface of sintered Ni guides the vertical growth of the Ni3S2/MoS2 NRs during the sulfurization process, which facilitates the exposure of MoS2 edges with active sites, leading to the outstanding catalytic performance with a low overpotential of 56 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Apart from superior catalytic HER performance, NRs@Sintered Ni800 electrode exhibits an ultrahigh tensile strength of 158.77 MPa, which is two orders magnitude than that of NRs@Ni foam electrode. During the long-term and cycling tests for stability and durability, the current density of NRs@Ni foam electrode is sharply decreased, and the HER performance significantly decays after 5000 CV cycles, which are possible because of the exfoliation of MoS2/Ni3S2 NRs from Ni foam surface and the appearance of cracks. However, the NRs@Sintered Ni800 electrode keeps a constant current density in the CA test, and its morphology has been largely reserved after 5000 CV cycles, demonstrating its outstanding durability as well as a tighter bonding strength between the decorated MoS2/Ni3S2 and the sintered Ni substrate. Even at high potentials of 200 mV and 300 mV, constant current densities are achieved over 100 h. This study can provide more possibilities for industrial applications and promote innovation in the research of self-supporting TMCs@Metal electrodes."
3,Experimental section,"Preparation of Ni metal substrate: Porous Ni metal substrates were prepared via a two-step sintering process. The typical experimental procedures are shown in Fig. 1, First, pure Ni powder was placed in a graphite die and consolidated via Spark plasma sintering (SPS) carried out at atmospheric pressure (no vacuum) to obtain a porous structure. The Ni metal slabs were subsequently annealed in a tube furnace under an Ar atmosphere at temperatures of 600, 700, 800, and 900 °C to obtain the Sintered Ni(600 ∼ 900) substrates. Preparation of self-supporting NRs@Sintered Ni electrodes: The as-prepared Ni metal substrates were decorated with MoS2/Ni3S2 via a facile hydrothermal sulfurization. In a typical experiment, the Mo source (sodium molybdate dehydrate, Na2MoO4) and the S source (TAA, thioacetamide, CH3CSNH2) were initially dissolved in 40 mL of distilled water and vigorously stirred for 30 min. Afterward, the solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and an as-obtained Ni matrix was immersed in the solution. The hydrothermal synthesis was carried out at 180 °C for 6 h, and the slab was removed after the system cooled down naturally. The slab was washed with distilled water and alcohol several times and then dried at 60 °C for 12 h under vacuum. The Ni600, Ni700, Ni800, and Ni900 samples all underwent identical hydrothermal treatments to obtain the electrodes denoted as NRs@Sintered Ni(600 ∼ 900) electrodes. Material characterization: The phase compositions of the samples were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The morphologies of the samples were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), while energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was used to analyze the distribution of elements. Electrochemical measurements: All the electrochemical experiments were carried out with a standard three-electrode system in alkaline media (1.0 M KOH) on a Biologic VSP electrochemical workstation. The as-prepared samples were employed directly as the working electrode, while a graphite rod and calomel electrode were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The catalytic HER activity of NRs@Sintered Ni was measured using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at a scan rate of 5 mV/s. The as-obtained polarization curves were iR-corrected with respect to the ohmic resistance of the solution, while the current densities were rectified corresponding to an area of 1 cm2. For comparison, a Pt plate measuring 1 cm × 1 cm was tested under the same conditions. Tafel slopes were analyzed based on the corresponding polarization curves using the Tafel equation: η = a + b·log j, where η is the overpotential, b is the Tafel slope, and j is the current density. Nyquist plots were measured with the same voltage amplitude of 10 mV over a constant frequency range of 1.0 MHz to 10 mHz at a series of overpotentials of 60, 90, 120, and 150 mV. The electrochemical durability was measured by LSV after carrying out cyclic voltammetry at a scan rate of 20 mV/s for 5000 cycles. Chronoamperometry (CA) measurements under constant overpotentials of 150 mV, 200 mV and 300 mV were employed to determine the stability over an extended period. All potentials measured were calibrated to RHE using the following equation: Evs RHE = Evs Hg/HgO + Eθ Hg/HgO + 0.059 × pH, (Eθ Hg/HgO = 0.098 V, pH = 14).
