0,Introduction,"Methanol as simplest aliphatic alcohols is one of the most important industrial petrochemical products that it is used as a fuel, solvent and intermediate for other component production. Methanol is a colorless liquid, completely miscible with water and organic solvents and very hydroscopic. It can be produced from different sources like natural gas, coal, biomass and petroleum. Commercially, it is produced from syngas in an isothermal packed bed reactor. A conventional type of methanol reactor is a shell and tube reactor in which tubes are packed with catalyst pellets. Boiling water circulates through the reactor shell side to remove the generated heat of reaction. Due to the equilibrium behavior of the reactions, methanol conversion in the conventional fixed bed methanol reactors is low. Thus, the most of unreacted syngas must be circulated in the process. There are several researches on methanol process in the literature. Lange presented a good review of methanol synthesis technologies (Lange, 2001). Graaf et al. (1990) modeled a low pressure methanol synthesis reactor using commercial CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst. They showed that commercial size of the catalyst particles exhibit intraparticle diffusion limitations and used the dusty gas model for describing internal mass transport limitations in the methanol synthesis. Lovik (2001) studied modeling, estimation and optimization of the methanol synthesis with catalyst deactivation. A rigorous pseudo-steady state modeling of methanol synthesis loop has been considered in his simulation. Jahanmiri and Eslamloueyan (2002) modeled a conventional methanol reactor and showed that the difference between one and two-dimensional simulation is negligible. Velardi and Barresi (2002) proposed a multi-stage methanol reactor network with autothermal behavior and periodical change of the inlet position to promote the reactor performance. They studied effect of the main operating parameters such as inlet temperature, switching time, inlet flow rate in methanol conversion. Kordabadi and Jahanmiri (2005) modeled and optimized methanol synthesis reactor to enhance overall production. This optimization approach enhanced a 2.9% additional yield in methanol reactor. Recently, a dual-type reactor system instead of a conventional methanol reactor was proposed by Rahimpour and Alizadehhesari, 2009. The dual-type methanol reactor is a novel technology for converting natural gas to methanol at low cost and in large quantities. The thermodynamic equilibrium limitations, catalyst deactivation and diffusion limitation of larger catalyst size can reduce and affect the conversion of industrial methanol synthesis processes. In a membrane reactor, the equilibrium limitation can be overcome by removal of products from reaction zone. In addition, coupling reaction and separation leads to lower cost in the separation stage. In many hydrogen related reaction systems, Pd-alloy membranes on stainless steel supports have been used as hydrogen permeable membranes (Lin and Rei, 2001). Gallucci et al. (2004) showed that using a membrane reactor it is possible to obtain higher conversion of CO2 and both higher methanol selectivity and methanol yield with respect to a traditional reactor. Rahimpour and Ghader, 2003 improved methanol production in an industrial methanol reactor by a Pd/Ag based hydrogen-permselective membrane tube. In this configuration, hydrogen permeates from membrane tubes to reaction zone. Rahimpour et al. (2008) suggested a new approach to improve the methanol production in an industrial single-type methanol synthesis reactor by applying hydrogen permselectivity from synthesis gas and adding it to the reactor. In this work a novel configuration is proposed for simultaneous hydrogen permeation and water vapor removal from reaction zone in the methanol synthesis reactor. The syngas is fed to the reaction zone that is surrounded with hydrogen-permselective membrane. The water vapor-permselective membrane tube is placed in the reaction zone. This configuration can increase methanol conversion and shift the thermodynamic equilibrium towards methanol production. It should be noted that water production during methanol synthesis by CO2 hydrogenation greatly reduces the methanol synthesis rate by suppressing the gas shift reaction (Wu et al., 2001). The main objective of this work is modeling and simulation of the proposed reactor for methanol synthesis and performance comparison of the proposed reactor with a conventional reactor at steady state condition. The reactor is modeled heterogeneously and numerical simulation is utilized to compare the results of novel membrane reactor with conventional reactor at the same process conditions. Also, to verify the accuracy of the proposed model and considered assumptions, results of steady state simulation for conventional reactor are compared with the plant data."
1,Process description,
2,Conventional methanol reactor,"2.1 Conventional methanol reactor Fig. 1 shows the schematic of a methanol synthesis reactor (Lurgi type). This reactor is basically a vertical shell and tube heat exchanger in which CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst is packed in the vertical tubes and tubes are being surrounded by the boiling water. The heat of exothermic reactions is transferred to the saturated water and saturated steam is produced. The base case specifications of reactor, catalyst and feed for Shiraz Petrochemical Complex have been tabulated in Table 1 ."
3,Membrane reactor,"2.2 Membrane reactor Fig. 2 shows the schematic of proposed membrane reactor for methanol production. This system consists of there concentric pipes. The wall of inner tube is water vapor-permselective membrane and between inner and second tube, reaction is placed. The wall of second tube is constructed from hydrogen-permselective membrane and hydrogen penetrates from the membrane tube to reaction zone. The outer tube surrounded by the boiling water and the heat of reactions is transferred to the boiling water and saturated steam is produced. In this configuration water vapor is removed and hydrogen is transferred to the reaction zone, simultaneously. In this dual membrane system, hydrogen can be withdrawn from the methanol synthesis purge stream by a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit and recycled to membrane section. Partial pressure difference of components between tubes permits diffusion of hydrogen and water vapor through the Pd/Ag and composite membrane layers, respectively. The generated heat of reaction should be transferred to the boiling water through the hydrogen layer as a medium. The base case specifications of proposed membrane reactor are tabulated in Table 2 ."
4,Membrane specification,
5,Hydrogen-permselective membrane,"3.1 Hydrogen-permselective membrane Membrane reactors combine reaction with separation to increase outlet conversion. In this study to overcome the thermodynamic limitations, methanol reactor can be devised by perm-selective membranes for H2 permeation to the reaction zone. Palladium-based membranes are used in hydrogen extraction because of their high permeability, selectivity and good surface properties (Buxbaum and Kinney, 1996). The permeation rate of hydrogen through the membrane is calculated from: (1) Q H = α H ( P H , 3 − P H , 2 ) In these equations α H is hydrogen permeation rate constant and are defined as follows (Hara et al., 1999): (2) α H = 2 π L P ¯ ln ( P 0 / P i ) where R o and R i stand for outer and inner radius of Pd/Ag layer. The permeability of hydrogen through Pd/Ag layer as a function of temperature is as follows (Barbieri and Maio, 1997; Shu et al., 1994): (3) P ¯ = P 0 exp ( − E p / R T ) where the P 0 above 200°C is reported as 6.33×10−8 molm2 sPa1/2 and activation energy E p is 15.7kJmol−1 (Shu et al., 1994; Itoh, 1987)."
6,Water vapor-permselective membrane,"3.2 Water vapor-permselective membrane As a solution to overcome the thermodynamic limitations, methanol reactor can be devised by permselective membrane layer for H2O removal that shifts the equilibrium in the favorable direction. Iliuta et al. (2010) studied H2O removal during DME synthesis using a composite membrane from a gaseous mixture contains of methanol, H2, CO, CO2 and DME in single step DME process. Lee et al. (2006) proposed a composite membrane with permeability of 1.14×10−7 molm−2 s−1 Pa−1 at a permeation temperature of 250°C (Lina et al., 1998). The permit H2O flux across the membrane is obtained from: (4) Q w = π w ( P w , 1 − P w , 2 )"
7,Reaction kinetics,"The reactions of methanol synthesis are mainly, CO and CO2 hydrogenation and the reversed water–gas shift reaction. (5) CO+2H2 ↔CH3OHΔH298 =−90.55kJkmol−1 (6) CO2 +3H2 ↔CH3OH+H2OΔH298 =−49.43kJkmol−1 (7) CO2 +H2 ↔CO+H2OΔH298 =+41.12kJkmol−1 In this work, rate expressions have been selected from Graaf et al. (1986, 1988). The rate equations combined with the equilibrium rate constants provide enough information about kinetics of methanol synthesis. The correspondent rate expressions due to the hydrogenation of CO, CO2 and the reversed water–gas shift reactions are: (8) r 1 = k 1 K CO ( f CO f H 2 3 / 2 − f CH 3 OH / f H 2 3 / 2 K P 2 ) ( 1 + K CO f CO + K CO 2 f CO 2 ) ( f H 2 1 / 2 + ( K H 2 − 1 / 2 K H 2 O f H 2 O ) ) (9) r 2 = k 2 K CO 2 ( f CO 2 f H 2 3 / 2 − f H 2 O f CH 3 OH / f H 2 3 / 2 K P 2 ) ( 1 + K CO f CO + K CO 2 f CO 2 ) ( f H 2 1 / 2 + ( K H 2 − 1 / 2 K H 2 O f H 2 O ) ) (10) r 3 = k 3 K CO 2 ( f CO 2 f H 2 − f H 2 O / K P 3 ) ( 1 + K CO f CO + K CO 2 f CO 2 ) ( f H 2 1 / 2 + ( K H 2 − 1 / 2 K H 2 O f H 2 O ) )"
8,Mathematical modeling,
9,Reaction side,"5.1 Reaction side A one-dimensional steady state heterogeneous model, based on mass and energy conservation laws, has been developed for simulation of proposed structure. In this model the following assumptions are considered: • Radial dispersion of mass and energy is negligible. • The gas mixture behavior is predicted by SRK equation of state. • Due to high gas velocity, axial diffusion of mass and heat are negligible. • Bed porosity in axial and radial directions is constant. • Plug flow pattern in reaction tube is considered. • Heat loss to surrounding is neglected. • The chemical reactions are assumed to take place only in the catalyst particles and homogenous reactions are neglected. • Lumped body is assumed for Catalyst slice (Biot<0.1). Subject to these assumptions, mass and energy balances for the gas phase in reaction zone are expressed by: (11) − 1 A c d ( F 2 y i g ) d z + a v c t k gi ( y i s − y i g ) + α i A c ( P i , 3 − P i , 2 ) − ( π D 1 ) π i A c ( P i , 2 − P i , 1 ) = 0 (12) − C p g A c F 2 d T 2 g d z + a v h f ( T 2 s − T 2 g ) − π D 1 A c U 1 − 2 ( T 2 g − T 1 g ) − π D 2 A c U 2 − 3 ( T 2 g − T 3 g ) − π D 1 A c ∫ T 0 T 1 Q w C p d T + 1 A c ∫ T 0 T 3 Q H C p d T = 0 Mass and energy balances for the solid phase are expressed by: (13) a v c t k g i , 2 ( y i g − y i s ) + η r i ρ b = 0 (14) a v h f ( T 2 g − T 2 s ) + ρ b ∑ i − 1 N η r i ( − Δ H f,i ) = 0 In above equations η is the effectiveness factor which is defined as actual reaction rate per particle to theoretical reaction rate in absence of internal mass transfer. This parameter is calculated from dusty gas model along the reactor. Also, the Ergun momentum balance equation is used to give the pressure drop along the reactor."
10,Membrane side,"5.2 Membrane side Mass and energy balance equations are written for hydrogen permselective side as follows: (15) − d F 3 y i g d z − α i ( P i , 3 − P i , 2 ) = 0 (16) − F 3 C p d T 3 g d z + ( π D 2 ) U 2 − 3 ( T 2 g − T 3 g ) − ∫ T 0 T 3 Q H C p d T + ( π D 3 ) U shell − 3 ( T Shell − T 3 g ) = 0 Mass and energy balance equations for water vapor permselective side (inner tube) are as follows: (17) − d ( F 1 y i g ) d z + ( π D 1 ) π i ( P i , 2 − P i , 1 ) = 0 (18) − C p g F 1 d T 1 g d z + ( π D 1 ) U 1 − 2 ( T 2 g − T 1 g ) + ( π D 1 ) ∫ T 0 T 2 Q w C p d T = 0"
11,Auxiliary equation,"5.3 Auxiliary equation To complete the simulation, auxiliary correlations should be added to the model. In the heterogeneous model, heat and mass transfer coefficients between gas and solid phases, physical properties of chemical species and overall heat transfer coefficient should be estimated from proper correlations. The used correlations for calculation of physical properties, mass and heat transfer coefficient are summarized in Table 3 ."
12,Numerical solution,"The governing equations combined with the kinetic expressions and auxiliary correlations are comprised nonlinear algebraic, ordinary differential equations. The formulated model consists of some ordinary differential equations as an initial value problem. This set of equations is solved with 4th order Runge–Kutta method. The results of node k are to be used as inlet conditions for the next node (k+1). At the end of this procedure it is possible to plot the concentration of components and temperature versus length."
13,Results and discussion,"The model of methanol synthesis side is validated against industrial methanol reactor for design specifications (Harting and Keil, 1993). The comparison between simulation results and plant data for industrial case is shown in Table 4 . It is shown that the simulation results have a good agreement with the plant data. In this section effect of membrane on key parameters of methanol reactor such as methanol, CO and CO2, H2 and H2O mole flow rate and temperature profile is considered."
14,Effect on methanol mole flow,"7.1 Effect on methanol mole flow Fig. 3(a) and (b) shows the methanol mole flow rate per one tube and methanol yield for conventional reactor and proposed configuration. Methanol yield is obtained from: (19) MeOH Yield = F CH 3 OH out F CO 2 in + F CO in It is observed that methanol mole flow rate and methanol yield in the proposed configuration is higher compared with conventional methanol reactor. These figures show that in the second half of the conventional reactor, the rate of methanol synthesis reactions have approached to equilibrium point and the membrane layer in this section is useful. This improvement is due to hydrogen transfer to the reaction zone and water vapor removal from reaction side using membrane tubes. The outlet methanol mole flow rate (summation of all tubes) from proposed configuration and conventional reactor for base case obtained about 112.68, 102.42mols−1, respectively. Also, methanol yield in the proposed configuration and conventional reactor for the base case obtain about 0.43 and 0.39, respectively. In this configuration methanol production capacity is improved about 10.02% compared with conventional methanol synthesis reactor."
15,Effect on CO2 & CO mole flow,"7.2 Effect on CO2 & CO mole flow CO2 and CO mole flow rate profiles per tube are shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). It is observed from synthesis methanol reactions that water vapor removal and hydrogen transfer to the reaction side, changes reactions to CO2 consumption which results an increase in equilibrium shift. It is known that the catalyst activity is at a maximum and the deactivation rate is low at lower CO2 concentration (Skrzypek et al., 1995). This is usually explained by copper oxidation caused by reversible reduction and oxidation reactions. Thus, as well as higher methanol production, lower CO2 content in the reaction zone improves catalyst deactivation in methanol synthesis process. Fig. 4(b) shows that CO mole flow rate in the proposed structure is higher compared with conventional reactor. It is observed from CO hydrogenation reaction (Eq. (5)), with hydrogen transfer to the reaction side, the reaction shifts to CO consumption. Also, CO is produced by water vapor removal according to water-gas shift reaction. Thus, CO molar flow rate in the proposed configuration can be higher compared with conventional reactor."
16,Effect on H2 mole flow,"7.3 Effect on H2 mole flow H2 mole flow rate per tube in the reaction section and H2 mole fraction in the hydrogen permeation section is shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), respectively. It is observed from Fig. 5(a) that hydrogen mole flow in the proposed reactor is larger compared with conventional reactor due to hydrogen permeation to the reaction zone. In the dual membrane reactor, shifting reactions to the right side using hydrogen permeation to the reaction zone and water vapor removal from reaction zone are the main reasons in increasing methanol yield and production capacity. With higher hydrogen consumption in the reaction zone, hydrogen permeation from membrane tube to the reaction side increases and consequently hydrogen level in the membrane tube decreases. With this occurrence, the hydrogen permeation is decreased which causes decreasing hydrogen level in the reaction side."
17,Effect on H2O mole flow,"7.4 Effect on H2O mole flow The water vapor mole flow rate per tube in the reaction side and H2O mole fraction in water permeation side of the proposed reactor is shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b), respectively. It is observed from Fig. 6(a) that water vapor mole flow rate in the proposed reactor is significantly lower compared with conventional reactor. By water vapor removed from reaction zone total water vapor mole flow rate (summation of all tubes) decreases from 46.24mols−1 in the conventional reactor to 36.6mols−1 in the proposed reactor. Produced water vapor during methanol synthesis from CO2 conversion accelerates the crystallization of Cu and ZnO contained in CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst, leading to its deactivation. Thus, lower water vapor content in the reaction zone improves catalyst deactivation in the methanol synthesis process. Fig. 6(b) shows that the water vapor mole fraction in the composite membrane tube is increased slightly sharp due to high water vapor pressure difference through the membrane layer."
18,Effect on temperature profile,"7.5 Effect on temperature profile Fig. 7 shows the temperature profile in the reaction section of proposed and conventional reactors. It is observed that temperature profile along the proposed structure is higher compared with temperature profile in conventional reactor. With the hydrogen and water vapor permeation in this configuration, methanol synthesis is improved and the higher heat of reaction produced. Increasing methanol synthesis and produced heat of reaction causes increasing temperature along the reactor. In the proposed configuration, the reaction side is placed between water and hydrogen membrane layers and reaction zone is surrounded with the hydrogen permselective tube. Also, the hydrogen permselective tube is surrounded by boiling water. Thus, the generated heat of reaction should be transferred to the boiling water through hydrogen permselective side as a medium. This causes a high heat transfer resistance and higher temperature in the reactor."
19,Conclusions,"In this study, a dual membrane reactor with simultaneous hydrogen permeation to the reaction zone and water vapor removal from reaction zone for methanol synthesis is modeled heterogeneously at steady state condition. The results of mathematical simulation for an industrial case are compared with the plant data and the accuracy of the proposed model and considered assumptions is demonstrated. The results of steady state simulation showed that the proposed dual membrane reactor enhances methanol production compared with conventional reactor. The outlet methanol mole flow rate of proposed membrane reactor is improved about 10.02% compared with the conventional reactor. Methanol production could be promoted beyond thermodynamic equilibrium by permeation of hydrogen from membrane to the reaction zone as a reactant and water vapor removal from reaction side as a product. Also, this reactor configuration leads to methanol yield about 0.43. Generally, the obtained results suggest that this configuration could be feasible and beneficial."
