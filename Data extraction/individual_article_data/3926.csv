0,Introduction,"Hydrogen becomes more attractive as an important alternative energy carrier and can be obtained from alcohols, bio-oil, etc., via processes of steam reforming (SR), partial oxidation (POX) and auto-thermal reforming (ATR) [1,2]. ATR includes endothermic steam reforming and exothermic partial oxidation, and the reaction heat can be balanced by adjusting the oxygen/fuel ratio of feeds [3]. For a durable catalyst in ATR, there are two concerns: sintering and oxidation of active components [2,4]. In the previous work [5,6], manganese or iron was introduced into a Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, in which high resistance to sintering and oxidation was observed, and the H2 yield reached 3.2mol-H2/mol EtOH. To develop catalysts with higher activity, novel supports, besides γ-Al2O3, can be a solution. Mg-based layered double hydroxides (LDH) are promising materials for catalytic applications [7]. Mg-based LDH can be categorized into a general formula: [Mg(II)1-xM(III)x(OH)2]x+Ax/n n− mH2O, where Mg(II) and M(III) can be partially substituted by other metal cations [7,8], and in this way, additives can be introduced into the skeleton or interlayer of LDH. After calcination and decomposition of the LDH, mixed oxides or solid solution can be formed with a MgO-like skeleton, which brings a homogeneous dispersion of active components and a better resistance to sintering [9,10]. In light of the aforementioned, the LDH-derived Ni-Mg-O catalysts were thus prepared for hydrogen production. Additives of manganese and iron were introduced via co-precipitation to modify their structural and electronic properties. The relationship between structure and reactivity in ATR for hydrogen production was studied as well."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation LDH-derived Ni-Mg-Mn-Fe-O catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation. Aqueous solutions of metal nitrates (Chengdu Kelong, AR) were prepared and precipitated dropwisely with the solution of Na2CO3.10H2O and NaOH (Chengdu Kelong, AR) at CO3 2-/OH- =1/16 and (total electron charge of metal cations)/(OH−)=1/8 at pH 10.5±0.5. The resulting suspensions were then aged at 78°C for 24h with stirring, filtered and washed three times with deionized water. The precipitations were dried at 105°C for 24h and then calcined at 650°C for 6h in air. The obtained LDH-derived oxides were listed in Table 1 ."
3,Catalytic performance test,"2.2 Catalytic performance test The ATR for hydrogen production was conducted in a fixed-bed reactor. In each test, the catalyst was reduced with pure H2 at 650°C for 1h. Feed of water–ethanol mixture was vaporized at 330°C with air and introduced in the reactor at C2H5OH:H2O:O2:N2 =1:3:0.5:1.86 (molar). The tail gases were analyzed online using a gas chromatography (GC-7890, Lunan Ruihong). Ethanol conversion, selectivity to C1 and C2 products and hydrogen yield were calculated and listed as follows: X ethanol = F ethanol in − F ethanol out / F ethanol in S i carbon − containing product = F i carbon − containing product / n i / F ethanol in − F ethanol out Y H 2 = F H 2 produced / F ethanol in In the above equations, Fi , in or out is the molar flow rate of the i species, and ni is the stoichiometric factor between the carbon-containing products and ethanol."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were carried out with an X-ray diffractometer (DX-2700, Haoyuan Instrument, China) for Cu Kα radiation at 40kV and 30mA. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) was conducted in a fixed-bed reactor at 10°C/min with a 5.0% H2/N2 mixture. Specific surface areas and pore sizes of the calcined samples were measured at −196°C on an automatic adsorption instrument (NOVA 1000e, QuantaChrome). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded by a Kratos Axis-Ultra DLD spectrometer using Al Kα radiation (1486.6eV). The binding energies were calibrated relative to the C1s peak from the carbon contamination at 284.6eV."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalytic performance in ATR of ethanol,"3.1 Catalytic performance in ATR of ethanol In ATR of ethanol, there are likely two main routes for ethanol conversion [4,6]: (1) one is the ethanol dehydration route (C2H5OH→C2H4 +H2O), in which ethylene is produced and can also be further transformed into ethane through hydrogenation (C2H4 +H2 →C2H6), in the meantime, coking via polymerization(nC2H4 →CnH2n+nH2 →nC+2nH2) can be a concern; (2) the other one is ethanol dehydrogenation route to acetaldehyde (C2H5OH→CH3CHO+H2), followed by the reaction of CH3CHO→CH4 +CO, while the derived products of CH4 and CO can be further transformed into H2 through steam reforming (SR), water–gas shift reaction (WGSR), and partial oxidation (POX) with H2O and/or O2, as followed: CH4 +H2O→CO+H2, CO+H2O→CO2 +H2, CH4 +1/2O2 →CO+2H2 and CO+1/2O2 →CO2. Therefore, the dehydrogenation pathway favors to hydrogen production. The LDH-derived catalysts were investigated by a 30-h test of ATR at 600°C and 1atm. As illustrated in Fig. 1(A) of the NM catalyst, the ethanol conversion was near 100%, and the H2 yield emerged near 3.71mol-H2/mol-EtOH but dropped slightly to about 3.59mol-H2/mol-EtOH. The H2 yield remained at 3.65mol-H2/mol-EtOH in the end. Within the product gases, neither ethylene nor ethane was detected. In addition, the selectivity to CO and CO2 reached 28.5% and 58.6%, respectively. The results indicate that ethanol was mainly converted to acetaldehyde via the dehydrogenation route, and further transformed to CH4, CO, CO2 and H2. With manganese in NMMn (Fig. 1(B)), theH2 yield increased slightly to about 3.70mol-H2/mol-EtOH. The selectivity to CO2 and CH4 decreased by about 0.5–1.0%, while CO increased by 1.0% concurrently. Over NMMnFe with half of manganese replaced by iron (Fig. 1(C)), the H2 yield reached 4.0mol-H2/mol-EtOH. Additionally, the selectivity to CH4 decreased from 12.5% to 10.0%, while the selectivity to CO increased from 29.0% to 31.2%, simultaneously. The increased H2 yield over NMMnFe can be attributed to a lower selectivity to CH4 with most of ethanol transformed via ethanol dehydrogenation. Compared with our previous work [10], in which catalysts of Ni0.35Mg2.65FeO4.5±δ and Ni0.35Mg2.65Al0.50Fe0.50O4.5±δ produced a H2 yield near 3.7mol-H2/mol-EtOH, NMMnFe in this work produced a higher activity, suggesting that there may be a synergistic effect of the manganese and iron in NMMnFe."
7,Characterizations,"3.2 Characterizations To find the relationship between structure and reactivity, the precursors of these Ni-based catalysts were characterized with XRD firstly. As shown in Fig. 2(A), there are strong peaks of brucite (Mg(OH)2, PDF no.: 07-0239) in NM. With Mn in NMMn, an LDH structure formed with trace of brucite. For the NMMnFe catalyst, the brucite structure almost disappeared, and the LDH structure remained as the main phase. The mean particle size of brucite in NM, as shown in Table 1, is 7.6nm, compared with 5.4nm in NMMn. In the mean time, the mean particle size of LDH structure, which was calculated by the peak near 23.0° in Fig. 2(A), is 9.7nm in NMMnFe, compared with 10.8nm in NMMn. The LDH precursors were calcined at 650°C for 6h and then scanned by XRD. As shown in Fig. 2(B), the brucite or LDH structure disappeared after calcination and transformed into a cubic phase of periclase (MgO, PDF no.: 45-0946). Over the NM catalyst, because NiO can form a similar face-centered cubic structure of bunsenite (NiO, PDF no.: 47-1049) [10], there was probably mixed oxide or solid solution of Mg(Ni)O [11], as phases of Mg0.4Ni0.6O (PDF no.: 34-0410) and/or MgNiO2 (PDF no.: 24-0712). For NMMn, the periclase of MgO was still the main crystal phase, and there was trace of spinel phases of NiMn2O4 (PDF no.: 84-0542), MnNi2O4 (PDF no.: 36-0083) and/or Mn3O4 (PDF no.: 13-0162). With iron in NMMnFe, the peaks of periclase became weaker. Meanwhile, spinel phases, e.g., NiMn2O4, NiFe2O4 (PDF no.: 10-0325), MnFe2O4 (PDF no.: 10-0319) and/or Fe3O4 (PDF no.: 26-1136), were detected as well. In the calcined catalysts, there was a solid solution of Mg(Ni)O, which is the precursors of Ni0 species. The mean particle size of Mg(Ni)O oxides could result in the reduction behavior of Ni in Mg(Ni)O oxides, and a lower particle size of Mg(Ni)O with more crystal defects can be more reducible [12,13]. Therefore, to estimate the mean particle size of Mg(Ni)O is important to find the reduction behavior of Ni in Mg(Ni)O oxides. As shown in Table 1, the mean particle size of Mg(Ni)O in NMMnFe is 9.8nm, which is smaller than that of NM (17.3nm) and NMMn (15.3nm), suggesting that the Mg(Ni)O species in MMMnFe can be more reducible. The surface area (SA) and pore size of LDH-derived oxides were measured. As shown in Table 1, NM has a SA of 65.9m2/g, while SA of NMMn decreased obviously to 42.1m2/g. This decrease can be attributed to the transformation of Mg(Ni)O to spinel phases (NiMn2O4 or MnNi2O4) with low SA [14]. For NMMnFe, SA reached 54.4m2/g because of insertion of Fe in the skeleton of Mg(Ni)O [10,15]. The catalysts reduced at 650°C were scanned by XRD. As shown in Fig. 2(C), there was only the periclase phase, and no obvious peak of Ni0 species was found, indicating that the possible Ni0 species may exist either in an amorphous state or in small Ni0 particles and cannot be found by XRD. Meanwhile, the peaks of spinel phases in NMMn and NMMnFe disappeared after reduction, suggesting that these spinel phases can be more reducible. To further study the reduction behavior, these Ni-based catalysts were tested by TPR. For NM, as shown in Fig. 3 , there is a reduction peak near 800°C, which can be attributed to the reduction of nickel in the mixed oxides of Mg(Ni)O [10]. For NMMn, there is a strong peak at 465°C with a shoulder peak at 295°C. These reduction peaks can be attributed to the reduction of Mn-containing species, including NiMn2O4, MnNi2O4, and/or Mn3O4, according to the results of XRD [16]. And in this way, species of Mn3+ can be reduced to Mn2+ [17], while Ni2+ in NiMn2O4 and/or MnNi2O4 can also be reduced to Ni0 simultaneously. Meanwhile, the peak near 755°C shrinks, suggesting that the content of mixed oxides of Mg(Ni)O may decrease. For the NMMnFe catalyst, the low-temperature peak was near 462°C, which can be attributed to the reduction of Fe-containing phases, including MnFe2O4, NiFe2O4, NiMn2O4 and/or Fe3O4 [10], as well as other Mn-containing phases, according to the results of XRD. Meanwhile, the reduction peak of Mg(Ni)O near 800°C grows, which is 3.5 times larger than that of NM in peak area, suggesting that the reduction behavior of Mg(Ni)O mixed oxides in NMMnFe may have been improved as well. The Ni0 atoms in an amorphous state or in small nickel particles cannot be identified by XRD but can be detected by XPS. As shown in Fig. 4(A–C), in all of the reduced samples, there are peaks near 852.3eV, 855.3eV and 862.1eV, which are corresponding to the characteristic peaks of Ni0, Ni2+ and the shake-up peak of Ni2+, respectively [18]. In Figs. 4(B) and (C), the peak of Ni0 becomes stronger in NMMn and NMMnFe. Meanwhile, the quantitative results show that the ratios of Ni0/(Ni0 +Ni2+) are 19.1% in NM, 23.3% in NMMn, and 32.1% in NMMnFe, respectively. This improvement in reduction behavior can be attributed to the spinel phases as well as a smaller particle size, as suggested by XRD and TPR. The spent catalysts were scanned with XPS as well. As shown in Fig. 4(D,E), the Ni0 peak in spent NM and NMMn becomes weaker than that of the reduced samples, while the Ni0 peak in spent NMMnFe still remains strong. The ratios of Ni0/(Ni0 +Ni2+) indicate that there is still 11.5% of Ni0 remained in the spent NM after the 30-h test, while these remaining Ni0 species were still active to transform ethanol to C1 products and H2, thus the activity of NM may retain and the H2 yield remained relatively stable near 3.65mol-H2/mol-EtOH. Over the spent NMMn, 20.8% of Ni0 remained after the 30-h test. For the spent NMMnFe, there was still 29.3% of Ni0 remained, suggesting that both manganese and iron can suppress the oxidation of Ni0 species in ATR process. The Ni/Mg atomic ratios over the surface of catalysts were obtained based on the peak areas after subtraction of the background, according to Cimino and Cesar reported [19,20]. The Ni/Mg atomic ratios of reduced samples varied in the following sequence: NM (4.06%)<NMMn (4.44%)<NMMnFe (4.61%). After stability test, the Ni/Mg atomic ratios were 3.97% in NM, 4.24% in NMMn and 4.88% in NMMnFe, respectively. Meanwhile, the Ni0/Mg ratio were calculated by ratios of Ni0/(Ni0 +Ni2+) and ratios of Ni/Mg, as follows: in the reduced catalysts, the Ni0/Mg ratio is 0.78% in NM, 1.04% in NMMn and 1.48% in NMMnFe, respectively; in the spent catalysts, the Ni0/Mg ratio is 0.47% in NM, 0.88% in NMMn and 1.43% in NMMnFe, respectively. These results on ratios of Ni0/(Ni0 +Ni2+) and Ni/Mg suggest that the higher surface content of Ni0 in NMMnFe may have resulted in the higher H2 yield, as compared with that of NM and NMMn, and is consistent with the results of ATR test. The spent catalysts were screened by XRD as well. As shown in Fig. 2(D), the Mg(Ni)O remained as the main phase in NM. For the spent NMMn, peaks of the spinel phases were observed. Because the surface ratio of Ni0/(Ni0 +Ni2+) dropped slightly from 23.3% to 20.8% in NMMn, these spinel phases could be Mn-containing species, e.g., Mg2MnO4 and Mn3O4, and only a small amount of Ni0 was oxidized and transformed into Ni-containing spinel phases. With Fe in NMMnFe, no obvious spinel phases were found, suggesting that Fe effectively improved the stability of crystal phases. Based on characterizations, one can find that the LDH structure can be formed via co-precipitation, and disappeared after calcinations with formation of a mixed oxide, Mg(Ni)O. With Mn in Mg(Ni)O, SA decreased from 65.9m2/g in NM to 42.1m2/g in NMMn because of the low SA of spinel phases of NiMn2O4, MnNi2O4, and/or Mn3O4 formed. Within NMMnFe, the half replacement of Mn by Fe resulted in an increase of SA to 54.4m2/g; meanwhile, there were spinel phases of NiMn2O4, NiFe2O4 and MnFe2O4 formed, and a lower particle size of Mg(Ni)O at 9.8nm was obtained. As a result, the reduction behavior of NMMnFe increased as well, as indicated by TPR, XRD and XPS. Furthermore, during the ATR test, the Ni0 species remained stable, according to XPS. Because of these improvements, a high H2 yield near 4.0mol-H2/mol-EtOH was obtained and remained stable in a 30-h ATR test over the NMMnFe catalyst."
8,Conclusions,"The Ni0.35 Mg2.65Mn0.5Fe0.5O4.5±δ catalyst was prepared via co-precipitation through LDH precursors and used for hydrogen production from ethanol by ATR. A high H2 yield was obtained at 4.0mol-H2/mol-EtOH and remained stable. This catalytic performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect by both iron and manganese on the structural and electronic properties: the surface area and reduction behavior were improved, and more Ni0 species were obtained and remained stable in ATR test."
