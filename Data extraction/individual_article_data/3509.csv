1,Hydrotalcite precursors preparation,"1.1 Hydrotalcite precursors preparation A series of Ni/Sn/Al hydrotalcite-like compounds with different Ni:Sn:Al atomic ratios were synthesized by a coprecipitation method (Pan et al., 2009). Two aqueous solutions, one containing a mixture of 0.8M NaOH and 0.05M Na2CO3, and the other Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Al(NO3)3·9H2O and SnCl2·2H2O of which the total metal ion concentration was equal to 0.4M, were added dropwise at ambient temperature while the pH value was maintained between 9 and 10. The resulting slurry was aged at 65°C for 24h. And the precipitate was washed with distilled water until the pH of the filtrate was reduced to 7, after it was dried at 55°C for 18h, crashed and passed through an 80-mesh sieve. The prepared catalysts precursors were designated as Ni/Sn/Al-HT."
2,Catalyst characterization,"1.2 Catalyst characterization The XRD patterns were obtained on a D/MAX-RB powder X-ray diffractometer under the following conditions: 40kV, 36mA, Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.542Å) and scanning rate of 4°/min within the range of 5°–70°. The diffraction pattern was identified by comparing with those included in the JCPDS (Joint Committee of Powder Diffraction Standards) data base. Thermogravimetric analysis (TG/DTA) was carried out on a homemade PCT-1A thermal analysis system with a heating rate of 10°C/min in flowing N2. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurements were performed with a JEOL JEM-6320F microscope. Element compositions of Ni/Sn/Al hydrotalcite were tested by a Noran VANTAGE-ESI energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS) at an accelerating voltage of 300kV. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) of the catalyst was performed at a ramping rate of 10°C/min ranging from ambient temperature to 800°C, using a mixture of 10vol.% H2/Ar as reducing gas. 50mg of sample was loaded in a quartz tube reactor of 7mm inner diameter, which was equipped with a MS for monitoring the H2 consumption."
3,Catalytic activity test,"1.3 Catalytic activity test The catalytic activity test for aqueous-phase reforming (APR) of ethylene glycol was carried out in a fixed bed reactor with catalyst of 1.5g, which was loaded in the stainless steel tubular reactor (8mm i.d.). Before the test, the catalyst was reduced at 550°C for 2h under H2 flow (30mL/min). The reaction took place at 210–240°C. An aqueous solution of 5wt.% ethylene glycol was introduced in an upflow configuration at 0.05–1.00mL/min with an HPLC pump. The total pressure of the system was regulated to 2.58–3.00MPa with Argon gas. The effluent from the reactor was water-cooled in a double-pipe heat exchanger to liquefy the condensable vapors, with the gas and liquid separated in a stainless-steel vessel (about 40cm3). Gaseous products were determined by gas chromatographs (GCs) equipped with thermal conductivity detectors (TCD). Hydrogen and methane were separated by a molecular sieve (13Å) column; CO2 and ethylene were analyzed by a Porapak column. Liquid products were analyzed after each run by a GC–MS or GC equipped with a flame-ionization detector (FID). The analysis result shows that liquid products mainly contain un-reacted ethylene glycol and methanol. The reactor system for APR process was established according to the previous researches (Cortright et al., 2002). The data concerning the performance of APR were collected for up to 4h on stream for each set of reaction conditions, to assure that the catalyst system reached steady state. In this work, H2 selectivity is calculated by hydrogen amounts of H2/total hydrogen amounts of gas production; Alkane selectivity is calculated by carbon amounts of alkanes/total carbon amounts of gas production."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Structure analysis of hydrotalcite precursors,"2.1 Structure analysis of hydrotalcite precursors The synthesis of binary Ni3Al-HT and trinary Ni/Sn/Al-HT is carried out by a coprecipitation method. The XRD patterns of Ni/Sn/Al-HT samples (Fig. 1 -(A): (Ni+Sn)/Al=3 and Ni/Sn=16, 20, 24, 48, +∞, respectively; Fig. 1-(B): (Ni+Sn)/Al=3 and Ni/Sn=2, 4, 8, 12, respectively) are exhibited in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 shows that a single hydrotalcite phase is obtained when Ni/Sn is greater than 16, while in the case that Ni/Sn≤12, a SnO phase is obviously observed companying a hydrotalcite phase. The interlayer spacing (dc) of Ni/Sn/Al-HT (Ni/Sn=16, 20, 24, 48, +∞) is 7.572, 7.707, 7.707, 7.752 and 7.752Å, respectively. In order to explain the reason for dc values grow up with the Ni/Sn increasing, we assume that the replacement of Ni2+ by Sn2+ occurs. Several important parameters of hydrotalcite can be calculated by following functions (Ni et al., 2006): (1) C e l l p a r a m e t e r a = 2 * 1 - x d M II -O + x d M III -O (2) E l e c t r o n i c d e n s i t y o f l a y e r q c = 2 x e / √ 3 ⋅ a 2 In which, x= M(III)/(M(II)+M(III)); d M(II)−O, d M(III)−O represent the distances between M(II) or M(III) and oxygen, respectively. The value a increases with the increase of Sn2+ content due to r Sn 2+ > r Ni 2+ (Pauling ionic radii r Ni 2+ =72pm and r Sn 2+ =112pm), and which results in the decrease of the electronic density of layers. The calculation result shows that interlayer spacing dc will increase when the Sn2+ content increases, which is contrary to the experiment result. The evolution of the interlayer distance reveals that Sn2+ is not introduced in the layers. Therefore, the M2+/Al3+ ratio (in fact Ni2+/Al3+ ratio) decreases as the Sn2+ content increases and as a consequence the interlayer distance also decreases. The thermal decomposition behavior of Ni/Sn/Al-hydrotalcite precursors is studied. The TG–DTA curves of representative samples are shown in Fig. 2 . Fig. 2 indicates that the total weight loss of the samples is about 34–39wt.%. Three weight loss steps are observed along with the endothermic peaks. The first endothermic peak appears at 148–162°C as a result of the loss of surface adsorbed water. The second one at 221–238°C is attributed to the loss of interlayer water without collapsing of the layer structure. And the third one that occurs at 323–349°C is introduced by the de-hydroxyl and de-carbonate processes. The last two endothermic peaks (the second and third ones) of the Sn-substituted precursors appear in the lower temperature than those of the binary NiAl-HT precursors, showing that Ni/Sn/Al-HT is less thermally stable than NiAl-HT. The results of H2-TPR analysis of catalysts with different Ni/Sn are shown in Fig. 3 . Based on the data from Fig. 3, the H2 reductive peaks of Ni3Al-HT are 338 and 519°C, respectively. Velu et al. (2000) reported that the uncalcined sample of NiAl–LDH exhibited a peak at 449°C together with shoulders at 371 and 527°C according to the TPR analysis, and H2(mol)/amount of Ni(mol) analysis shows that the H2 consumption corresponds to the reduction of Ni2+ to Ni0 in the LDH. It is also found that all Ni/Sn/Al-HT catalysts primarily contain two reductive peaks which show up at 315–338°C and 473–519°C. The low-temperature reductive peak appears probably due to the direct reduction of Ni ions within the layers of hydrotalcite according to previous work (Pan et al., 2010). TPR profile of SnO2/Al2O3 shows two maxima at 718 and 912K, the first one corresponds to the reduction of SnO2 to SnO, whereas the other one to the reduction to the metallic form (Kirszensztejn et al., 2009). So the high-temperature reductive peak appears likely due to the reduction of NiAl(O), SnO or spinel-like phases. With increase of the Sn contents (Ni/Sn=48, 24, 20, 16, respectively), the first H2 reductive peaks decrease to 329, 324, 317, 322°C, and the second reductive peaks decrease to 487, 480, 473, 475°C. It is concluded that the reductive temperature of NiSnAl-HT decreases in the order of (a) Ni3Al-HT> (b) Ni48SnAl49/3-HT> (c) Ni24SnAl25/3-HT> (e) Ni16SnAl17/3-HT≈ (d) Ni20SnAl7-HT. The reductive temperature of Ni/Sn/Al-HT decreases as the Sn contents increase implying that the presence of Sn following the NiAl-HT enhances the reducibility of Ni2+ species (Velu et al., 2000)."
6,"XRD, SEM, and EDS analyses of catalysts","2.2 XRD, SEM, and EDS analyses of catalysts The catalysts after reduction are surprisingly flammable due to the small metal particle and high activation of Ni. It is thus claimed that hydrotalcite derived catalysts have a high catalytic activity. The attempt at obtaining the reduced samples turns out unsuccessful, so the Ni20SnAl7-HT derived catalyst after reaction is sampled for XRD, SEM, and EDS analyses. The XRD pattern of Ni20SnAl7-HT derived catalyst after reaction is displayed in Fig. 4 . The result of XRD analysis shows that the composition of catalyst contains Ni, Ni3Sn, and Al2O3·H2O. And the catalytic performance of catalysts Ni/Sn/Al-HT with different Ni/Sn is listed in Table 1 . In-depth analysis of catalytic data of Table 1 indicates that the activated component to H2 production is Ni, and the H2 production selectivity and catalytic activity are likely to be promoted by the Ni3Sn alloy conformed. Fig. 5 displays that the SEM and EDS patterns of Ni20SnAl7-HT derived catalysts after reaction. As suggested in Fig. 5-(A), the structure of Ni20SnAl7-HT is composed of two separate phases: porous Ni-rich compact regions and crystalline regions containing primarily Al and O, which is similar to the Sn modified Raney Ni catalyst (Shabaker et al., 2004). The aluminum-rich phase forms crystallites (0.5–1.5μm long) after exposure to aqueous-phase reforming reaction conditions, while the porous Ni-rich regions remains intact. Fig. 5-(B) shows that the composition of Ni20SnAl7-HT derived catalyst after reaction. It is calculated that the Ni/Sn of catalyst after reaction is equal to 22.9, and this value is higher than the theoretical one of Ni20SnAl7-HT. It means that the leaching of Sn occurs during reaction (Shabaker et al., 2005)."
7,Effects of reaction conditions on performance over Ni20SnAl7-HT,"2.3 Effects of reaction conditions on performance over Ni20SnAl7-HT Shown in Fig. 6 –8 is the influence of the reaction temperature, pressure and the feeding rate of ethylene glycol on the H2, CO2, and CH4 production rate over Ni20SnAl7 hydrotalcite derived catalyst. 2.3.1 Effect of temperature Fig. 6 indicates that the catalytic performance is promoted when the reaction temperature increases. Namely, the temperature increases from 210 to 240°C, H2 production rate grows up from 141 to 340μmol/min. The H2 selectivity reaches almost 100% in the effluent over the Ni20SnAl7-HT derived catalyst, and methane can hardly be detected. 2.3.2 Effect of pressure When the reaction pressure increases from 2.58 to 3.00MPa, as illustrated in Fig. 7 , H2 production rate drops from 292 to 87μmol/min. Meanwhile, H2 selectivity remains higher than 98%, and the alkane selectivity is lower than 2%. Davda et al. (2005) and Shabaker et al. (2004) reported that the activity of Raney Ni catalyst reduced with rising pressure. They ascribed this effect to the inhibition by high product partial pressures. 2.3.3 Effect of feeding rate Fig. 8 shows the effect of feeding rate on hydrogen production. It is found that the H2 production rate increases from 190 to 370μmol/min with the feeding rate of ethylene glycol aqueous solutions goes up from 0.05 to 1.00mL/min. And the H2 and alkane selectivities (which are about 100% and 0% in the effluent, respectively) are barely affected by the feeding rate."
8,Effect of Ni/Sn on the catalytic performance,"2.4 Effect of Ni/Sn on the catalytic performance Table 1 shows the performance for APR of ethylene glycol over Ni/Sn/Al-hydrotalcite derived catalysts against the Ni/Sn. In the case of binary Ni3Al-hydrotalcite derived catalyst, the H2 selectivity of gas products is only 71.5%, and alkane selectivity reaches 23.6%. While the catalysts with Ni/Sn=2–48 have a better H2 selectivity, all reaching approximately 100%, and a high production rate ranging from 227 to 292μmol/min. Sn modified Raney Ni shows a high H2 selectivity when Sn content is more than 1% (Huber et al., 2003; Shabaker et al., 2004), which coincides with our experimental results. The H2 selectivity of Ni20SnAl7-HT reaches nearly 100% when Ni/Sn is less than 48. Meanwhile, the hydrogen production rate reaches the highest value (292μmol/min) when Ni/Sn=16–20, while the activity of catalyst decreases out of this range. The H2 activity is comparable to the results of Ce modified Pt/γ-Al2O3, and is better than Mg modified Pt/γ-Al2O3 (Bai et al., 2006)."
9,Catalytic stability of Ni20SnAl7-HT,"2.5 Catalytic stability of Ni20SnAl7-HT Fig. 9 displays that catalytic performance versus time on the steam for aqueous-phase reforming of 5wt.% ethylene glycol at 0.05mL/min feeding rate over Ni20SnAl7-hydrotalcite derived catalyst. It is apparent that Ni/Sn/Al-hydrotalcite derived catalyst has a good catalytic stability during aqueous-phase reforming process. The rate of H2 production over Ni20SnAl7-HT derived catalyst decreases by only 10% after 20h and reached a constant value equal to 85% of initial activity after 80h. After 96h, the catalyst still maintains 75% of initial activity. Shabaker et al. (2004, 2005) reported that alumina-supported nickel catalysts exhibit severe deactivation phenomena. For sample, NiSn/Al2O3 prepared by impregnation method lost 80% of their initial activity over a period of 8h. In comparison, the good catalytic stability of Ni20SnAl7-hydrotalcite derived catalyst is likely to be related to the high (Ni+Sn) contents, the good dispersion of active Ni or Ni3Sn, and strong interaction between the active metals and supports."
10,Conclusions,"Ni/Sn/Al hydrotalcite (Ni/Sn/Al-HT) are synthesized by a coprecipitation method. The result shows that Sn2+ is not introduced in the layers because of its large ionic radii. As-prepared samples consist of a hydrotalcite phase and a SnO phase. As a novel catalyst for H2 produced by aqueous-phase reforming of biomass-derived ethylene glycol (EG), H2 selectivity and catalytic activity are improved when Sn modified Ni/Al-HT, which is attributed to the formation of Ni3Sn alloy. Ni20SnAl7-HT shows a high H2 production rate, and a good H2 selectivity of ca. 100%, as well as a good catalytic stability over 120h. With their ease of fabrication and good performance, Ni/Sn/Al hydrotalcite derived catalysts will be interesting in potential application for aqueous-phase reforming reaction."
