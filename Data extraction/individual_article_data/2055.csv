0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is an attractive energy carrier due to its high abundance, high energy density and environmentally friendly utilization [1]. Hydrogen can be used in lightweight proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) for power generation with a high energy efficiency, releasing only water and heat. Therefore, PEMFCs fueled with pure hydrogen have been considered one of the most promising power sources for portable applications such as hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, the lack of efficient and low-cost hydrogen production and storage is still a major challenge towards the commercialization of fuel cell power systems. Sodium borohydride (NaBH4), as a typical example of chemical hydrides, has been considered a safe and convenient hydrogen source due to its high hydrogen storage capacity (10.8 wt %), nontoxicity, ambient operation temperature, and hydrolysis reaction controllability [2–4]. However, the wide application of NaBH4 is impeded by the high cost (the use of noble metal catalysts) and relatively poor stability of the catalyst. The development of a low-cost, durable and active catalyst for the NaBH4 hydrolysis reaction is thus the key to efficient on-site hydrogen production for fuel cell applications. Hydrolysis of NaBH4 is activated by various catalysts, including platinum, rhodium, ruthenium [5], cobalt, and nickel. Platinum [6–8], rhodium, and ruthenium [7–16] are effective catalysts, but these catalysts are very expensive, hindering large-scale commercial applications. Cobalt-based [17–39] and nickel-based [29–31,40–42] catalysts show good catalytic activities and hydrogen production rates for the hydrolysis of NaBH4. The main reason is that the metal Co has an amorphous structure, and it is characterized by short-range ordering and long-distance disorder, a high concentration of unsaturated sites and good chemical stability. Co–B alloy- and Co–B-based catalysts are also considered good candidates for NaBH4 hydrolysis owing to their satisfactory activity and low cost [24,43–46]. The addition of element B can produce a synergistic effect between metal Co and B and show better catalytic activity. However, nonnoble metal catalysts are usually less efficient than noble metal catalysts, and they may also suffer from poor stability for hydrogen production. Liang Y et al. prepared an Fe–Co–B/Ni catalyst, whose catalytic performance decreased to 54% after 6 cycles [47]. The catalytic performance of the Co–B catalyst synthesized by Komova et al. [48] was reduced to 40% after 14 reaction cycles. Kim et al. [29] reported that the catalytic performance of Co–Ni–P decreased to 25% after 15 cycles. The catalytic performance of the Ni–Ru catalyst synthesized by AMFR et al. [49] decreased to 25% after 300 cycles. Recently, it was found that the CoWB catalyst is highly effective for catalyzing hydrogen generation from a NaBH4 alkaline solution [24,50,51]. However, CoWB also suffers from an agglomeration phenomenon that limits its durability. It is expected that the catalyst activity and durability can be enhanced by loading the catalyst on high-surface-area supporting materials or by doping suitable elements into the catalyst. Most catalyst supports are porous materials, including NF (nickel-form), carbon spheres, γ-Al2O3, honeycomb ceramics, etc. Among them, NF, having a porous structure, low areal density, and high thermal and chemical stability under hydrolysis conditions, is considered one of the best supports for catalysts. In this work, a novel CoWB catalyst supported by nickel foam was fabricated by a pulse electrodeposition (PED) method. The CoWB/NF catalyst synthesized using the method exhibited a high activity and durability towards the hydrolysis reaction in NaBH4 solution."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals NF was purchased from Hunan Liyuan New Martials Company. Cobalt chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2 .6H2O, AR), sodium tungsten (Na2WO3, AR), sodium borohydride (NaBH4, AR), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, AR) and ethylene glycol (EG, AR) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Alcohol and hydrochloric acid were purchased from Beijing Chemicals Ltd. Deionized water was used as the solvent whenever water was used in the synthesis and experiments."
3,Preparation,"2.2 Preparation Nanodendritic-structured CoWB/NF catalysts were prepared by pulse electrodeposition (PED). The methods were similar to those given in our previous publications [52–54], as shown in Fig. 1 . Essentially, NF (Ni foam, 1 cm × 1 cm) was first immersed in ethanol and ultrasonicated at 25 °C for 30 min to remove the greasy dirt on the surface, followed by soaking in 10 vol% HCl solution for 15 min at room temperature to remove inorganic impurities. Finally, all the samples were cleaned by deionized water. In a typical run, the pretreated NF was impregnated in the CoCl2 EG solution for 3 h and then plated in a mixed 50 °C solution including Na2WO3, NaBH4, and NaOH. The pulse electrodeposition current density was 200 mA/cm2 at a Ton time of 2 ms, a Toff time of 5 ms, and a total plate time of 900 s. The catalysts were thoroughly washed with ethanol and deionized water and were finally dried in a vacuum oven at 323 K for 12 h. The prepared catalyst was denoted as CoWB/NF."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The composition of the CoWB/NF catalyst was determined by conventional X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) on a Rigaku D/MAX-RB diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan). The surface morphology of the catalyst was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, HITACHI S-4300, Japan) equipped with energy-dispersive spectroscopy analysis (EDS). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB 250) measurements were conducted to determine the chemical bonding states. Specific surface areas were determined by a Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) surface area analyzer (Autosorb-IQ)."
5,Hydrogen generation rate (HGR) test,"2.4 Hydrogen generation rate (HGR) test The HGR was measured by a classical water-displacement method. Typically, the HGR was tested in a 100 mL three-neck flask immersed in a constant temperature bath. First, 10 g of an aqueous solution consisting of NaBH4 (5 wt%) and NaOH (2 wt%) was added into the flask, and then the CoWB/NF catalyst was rapidly added to initiate the hydrolysis reaction under stirring. The volume of the evolved hydrogen was recorded by the volume of drained water of the bird-shaped bottle. Each measurement was repeated 3 times. The average HGR was normalized as mL·min−1·g−1 (CoWB). (1) H G R = V t ∗ ( m 2 − m 1 ) where m1 is the weight of dried catalyst before PED, m2 is the weight of dried catalyst after PED, t is the time of hydrogen production, and V is the generated volume of hydrogen."
6,Solution uptake test,"2.5 Solution uptake test The solution uptake (SU) in the catalyst was determined and calculated through the difference value between the mass before and after the catalyst was immersed into the NaBH4 alkaline solution. Catalyst samples were weighed three times on an electronic balance after drying in a vacuum drying oven for 300 min at 323 K, and the average mass was denoted as m3. The catalyst sample was put into different concentrations of a NaBH4 alkaline solution (2 wt% NaOH) for 10 min and then removed. The catalyst samples were weighed three times again, and the average mass was denoted as m4. The solution uptake (SU) value was calculated by formula (2). (2) S U = m 4 − m 3 m 3 ∗ 100 %"
7,Durability of catalyst,"2.6 Durability of catalyst Catalyst samples were dipped into different concentrations of NaBH4 alkaline solution (2 wt% NaOH) for 16 h every time and then removed and washed with 1 M HCl to remove the surface residual liquid [54]. The HGR was tested at the beginning every time. This process was repeated fifty times, and the durability results were obtained by data processing."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The surface morphologies of the NF and CoWB/NF catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 (a). Compared to the smooth surface of the NF, a large-area forest-like catalyst coating was observed on NF with a nanodendritic structure formed in the pulse electrodeposition process. The enlarged photographs in Fig. 2 (c) clearly show that CoWB grew with a nanosized dendritic structure. The TEM image shown in Fig. 2(e) further exhibits its nanodendritic structure. The main reason is that the CoWB/NF catalyst has a highly preferred orientation in the growth process by PED. This special structure could provide favorable sites not only for the CoWB catalyst to be firmly rooted in NF but also for the growth of abundant side branches that from the site, providing more accessible active sites for the reactants [55]. The AFM images shown in Fig. 2(j) display the nanostructure of the acicular array in the extremity of the side branch. There are 167 peaks in the 25 nm2 area. The average distance between peaks is 0.31 nm. This further proves that the dendritic structure has abundant branch tips as catalytic active sites. Fig. 2 (b) shows energy dispersive spectra corresponding to the selected zone in the CoWB catalyst indicated in the inset. The EDS analysis shows that the catalyst coating consisted of the three elements studied, namely, Co, B and W, and their atomic ratio is 51:19:3. In addition, the C signal in the spectra can be attributed to the conductive adhesive introduced during sample preparation. In addition, the O signal might come from the adsorbed oxygen or H2O [50]. Fig. 2 (d) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the CoWB/NF catalyst. The catalyst sample CoWB/NF was typical of a crystalline-phase structure with sharp crystalline Ni peaks at 2 theta values of 45°, 52° and 76°. After pulse deposition, the as-synthesized CoWB/NF evolved from the crystalline phase to an amorphous structure in the PED process [56]. As shown in Fig. 2(f–i), the surface species and electronic structures of the CoWB/NF catalyst were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS results clearly show the peaks belonging to Co, W, B and Ni in the CoWB/NF NDs. The atomic ratio of Co, B, and W is 51:17:1, which is similar to the EDS measurement results. In the deconvoluted XPS spectrum of Co 2p (Fig. 2(f)), two peaks located at 780.73 and 796.68 eV are assigned to the binding energies of Co 2p3 and Co 2p1, which indicates the presence of metallic Co close to the electrode surface. Additionally, the peak centered at 780.9 eV is attributed to the main peak of oxidized Co 2p3. Fig. 2(g) shows the W 4f spectrum, with the binding energy located at 34.73 eV assigned to W 4f5, which exhibits a clear shift to a lower value (33.5 eV for standard W 4f5). As is well known, the d-band character of W dominates the band structure of the catalyst surface and then affects the electrocatalytic activity of the NaBH4 hydrolysis reaction. Fig. 2(h) shows the B 1s spectrum, with the peak located at 191.68 eV assigned to WB and the peak at 194.4 eV assigned to B oxide caused by the oxidation of the catalyst surface. Modification of the electronic structure occurs after the PED process, resulting in an upshift of the d-band center for the CoWB/NF NDs that may alter the chemisorption of reactants, intermediates, and products and thus enhance the electrochemical performance in the hydrogen generation reaction. Fig. 4 shows that the BET surface area of the CoWB/NF catalyst is 35.56 m2/g, which is larger than that of the CoB/NF catalyst. The main reason is the W doping and nanodendrites with acicular array structures growing on the Ni foam surface by pulse electrodeposition. This larger surface area provides more active sites for the hydrolysis of sodium borohydride."
10,Catalytic performance,"3.2 Catalytic performance 3.2.1 Effect of the mole fraction of W/Co in the initial plating solution The effect of the mole fraction of W/Co in the initial plating solution was studied, as shown in Fig. 3(a–c). The as-prepared W-doped alloy catalyst presents a high activity towards hydrolysis of the NaBH4 solution, but the catalytic activity is closely related to the W content in the initial plating solution. This is because the XPS spectrum of W 4f5 shifted when W was doped into the CoWB/NF catalyst in the PED process, which led to different catalytic effects. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the CoWB/NF catalyst with a W/Co mole fraction of 40% shows the maximum catalytic activity. By using the optimized CoWB/NF catalyst, the 5 wt% NaBH4+2 wt% NaOH solution can yield H2 at an HGR of 1.711 L min−1·g−1 at 30 °C. The HGR of the CoWB/NF catalyst increased with increasing reaction temperature, and the HGR reached as high as 14.13 L min−1·g−1 (CoWB) at 70 °C. Due to the doped W, the d-band character of W dominates the band structure of the catalyst surface and then affects the electrocatalytic activity of the NaBH4 hydrolysis reaction [24,50,51]. The activation energy was calculated using the Arrhenius equation. The regression coefficients and activation energy at different W/Co ratios are given in Table 1 and Fig. 3(b and c). The activation energy of CoWB/NF has a lower value of 18.15 kJ mol−1 at a 40% W/Co ratio, resulting in an easier reaction path for NaBH4 hydrolysis."
11,Solution uptake,"3.3 Solution uptake It is necessary to consider the solution uptake in the porous catalyst for the hydrolysis of sodium borohydride. The porous structure provides a reaction pathway and space for gas-liquid two-phase flow of hydrogen gas and NaBH4. At the same time, the porous catalyst can partially maintain a mixed reaction solution. It will take time to stop hydrogen gas production on the surface of the catalyst when the catalyst is removed from the solution. The trailing time affects the control of the hydrogen-producing system. Fig. 3 (d) shows the results of solution uptake in the CoWB/NF catalyst. The solution uptake increased linearly with increasing concentration from 5 wt % to 25 wt%. The main reason is that the porous catalyst holds almost the same volume of solution, and the more highly concentrated solution has a larger solution density. These results and conclusions are beneficial for the design of H2 generators."
12,Effect of NaBH4 concentration,"3.4 Effect of NaBH4 concentration The rate of hydrogen generated versus the concentration of NaBH4 in wt.% is given in Fig. 3 (e). The effect of NaBH4 concentration on the hydrogen generation rate was measured using x wt. % NaBH4 (x = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35) and 2 wt% NaOH solution at 30 °C using CoWB/NF catalyst. As the NaBH4 concentration increased from 5 wt % to 35 wt%, the average hydrogen generation rate decreased. The result is the same as that explained in the literature [44]. The main reason may be that the porous structure caused the NaBH4 solution to diffuse to the surface of the CoWB/NF catalyst with a higher solution viscosity at a higher NaBH4 concentration, which is discouraging for hydrogen generation on the interface between the catalyst and solution."
13,Effect of NaOH concentration,"3.5 Effect of NaOH concentration The effect of NaOH concentration on hydrogen production from the hydrolysis of NaBH4 has been studied. Fig. 3(f) illustrates the hydrogen generation rate with different NaOH concentrations, i.e., 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 wt %, in 10 g of NaBH4 solution with 30 wt% NaBH4 at 30 °C. When the NaOH concentration increased from 0 wt % to 2 wt%, the HGR decreased rapidly. This phenomenon is well known and can be explained [43] by the inhibition and stabilization effects of the hydroxyl ions in the NaBH4 solution. Then, when the NaOH concentration changed from 2 wt% to 8 wt%, the HGR increased and remained steady. The reason is that OH− is involved in the hydrolysis of NaBH4, and an increase in NaOH concentration leads to a decrease in NaBO2 solubility and subsequent precipitation from the solution and adherence on the catalyst surface. As a result, the hydrolysis reaction is hindered. In addition, hydroxyl ions strongly complex water, thus decreasing the available free water needed for NaBH4 hydrolysis [45]."
14,Effect of solution temperature and activation energy,"3.6 Effect of solution temperature and activation energy The influence of temperature on the hydrogen generation rate in solutions containing 30 wt% NaBH4 and 2 wt% NaOH was investigated at temperatures ranging from 30 °C to 70 °C, as shown in Fig. 3(g and h). As expected, the hydrogen generation rate increases with temperature. Decreasing the NaOH concentration had an inhibitory effect at room temperature, and this effect was further increased at higher solution temperatures. The activation energies are calculated and analyzed with the reaction rates of the synthesized CoWB/NF catalyst at different temperatures by using the Arrhenius equation as follows: (3) Ln k = ln A - Ea/RT where k (L min−1 g−1) is the rate coefficient, A (min−1 g−1) is a constant, Ea (kJ mol−1) is the activation energy, R (8.314 J mol−1 K−1) is the universal gas constant, and T (K) is the temperature. The two parameters, Ln k and 1/T, are fitted linearly. The slope of the linear equation equals – Ea/R, and the activation energy can be calculated with the slope multiplied by –R. The activation energy of hydrolysis of NaBH4 in the presence of the CoWB/NF catalyst in the temperature range from 30 °C to 70 °C is shown in Fig. 3 (c), and the value is as low as 18.15 kJ/mol in contrast to 28 kJ/mol for Pd/C catalysts. The CoWB/NF catalyst had a high HGR, which reached 14.13 L min−1·g−1 cat at 70 °C (30 wt% NaBH4, 2 wt% NaOH) and was comparable to that of noble metal catalysts in the literature [21,46,54,56–60], as shown in Table 2 . The CoWB/NF catalyst shows ideal catalytic activity and lower activation energy, especially a long enough service life for hydrolysis of sodium borohydride at different working concentration conditions. The kinetic order of hydrolysis of the CWB/NF catalyst was calculated by the n-order kinetics model in formula (3). (4) - r NaBH 4 = d C NaBH 4 d t = k C NaBH 4 n = 4 k C H 2 n = 4 d C H 2 d t = 4 r H 2 The exponent of n is the reaction order. It is known that the relationship between hydrogen generation volume and time is linear. Therefore, the hydrogen generation rate and reaction rate of NaBH4 are constant in the hydrolysis process of sodium borohydride. The kinetic order n is zero, which indicates that it is a typical zero-order reaction with the CWB/NF catalyst."
15,Durability,"3.7 Durability Catalyst durability is a crucial parameter for a practical hydrogen generation apparatus. In the present study, the durability of the CoWB/NF catalyst prepared by PED was tested in continuous hydrogen production tests. After the catalytic hydrolysis reaction, the catalyst was separated from the byproduct solution, washed thoroughly with deionized water and reused. As seen in Fig. 5 (a and b), the effect of NaBH4 concentration was that the durability was better at higher NaBH4 concentrations with 300 h of testing. After that, the CoWB/NF catalyst showed better durability in continuous usage at a NaBH4 concentration of 30 wt% than at lower concentrations. Fig. 5(c and d) shows that even after 800 h, the catalytic activity could retain 82% HGR of its initial performance, 1.41 L min−1·g−1 (cat). The main reason for the decline was the production of the major byproduct sodium metaborate that might lead to a viscous solution to block the active catalytic sites and paths for hydrogen evolution from the surface of the catalyst. TOF (turnover frequency) was used to measure the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. The basic meaning is the amount of material catalyzed by a catalyst per unit mass per unit time. To calculate the TOF of the CoWB active catalyst, we used the following formula: (5) T O F = The moles number of H 2 turnover Mass of catalyst × Time of reaction We calculated the TOF of CoWB in the service life process, and the results are shown in Fig. 5(f). The SEM images of CoWB/NF after the 800-h stability test are shown in Fig. 5(e). The nanostructures of the CoWB/NF catalyst do not suffer from destruction, indicating that the nanostructures in the CoWB/NF catalyst are very stable against aggregation and destruction in the hydrolysis of sodium borohydride, which is the same conclusion reported in the literature [62–67]."
16,Hydrogen generation performance in the generator,"3.8 Hydrogen generation performance in the generator We designed and developed a hydrogen generator based on the CoWB/NF catalyst, and a photograph is shown in Fig. 6 (a) . The diameter and height size of this cylindrical system are both 20 cm. The hydrogen generation volume is linearly increased, and the rate is steady; the average rate is 1.07 L/min, as shown in Fig. 6 (b). The hydrogen gas purity was tested by gas chromatography, and the results are shown in Fig. 6(c and d). The FID front signal shows three impurities: CH4 (0.0005%), C2H6 (0.0006%), and C2H4 (0.0003%). The TCD back signal indicates that the main impurity is CO2 (0.0115%), and the hydrogen purity is H2 (99.9871%). The source of impurities may come from the NaBH4 or NaOH raw material. The purity is high enough to serve as the hydrogen source for a fuel cell, and the hydrogen generation rate could supply hydrogen for a 100 W fuel cell system."
17,Conclusions,"A CoWB catalyst supported on NF was prepared by using the pulse electrodeposition method. The special microstructure of nanodendrites with acicular arrays formed during the pulse growing process, which increased the BET surface area, especially provided more nanostructure pores. Therefore, the CoWB/NF catalyst has an ideal hydrogen generation rate, and the HGR reached 14.13 L min−1·g−1 cat. Tungsten doping decreased the activation energy to as low as 18.15 kJ mol−1. The CoWB/NF catalyst showed a superior hydrogen production stability of 300 h at different NaBH4 concentrations. The hydrogen production service life was up to 800 h, and the catalyst demonstrated very good stability, as the catalytic activity was maintained at 82%. The pulse electrodeposition method can enhance the adhesion between the catalyst and carrier of NF. The present work reveals that a CoWB catalyst supported on NF could be used in practical NaBH4–based hydrogen generators for portable fuel cell systems with high catalytic activity and high durability."
