0,Introduction,"The use of hydrogen as an energy vector by applying it in fuel cells, is being considered as a possible means of improving the current energy outlook. However, the use of hydrogen as an energy source will only be possible if methods other than those currently used for its production are implemented (Tollefson, 2010). At present hydrogen is mainly produced from fossil fuels, but this is associated with several environmental problems related to greenhouse-gas emissions. Although hydrogen can be produced from completely carbon-free sources, the procedures are still economically unviable. In the meantime the use of biomass has been proposed to overcome such environmental problems. (Ramírez de la Piscina and Homs, 2009). Moreover, renewable biomass-derived sources are currently of great interest for the production of valuable chemicals and fuels (Huber et al., 2006; Xuan et al., 2009; Marshall and Alaimo, 2010; Tanksale et al., 2010). In recent years, advances have been made in the study of reforming processes of biomass-derived alcohols for producing hydrogen. Bioethanol is currently the most common biofuel and bioethanol-reforming processes are considered attractive and promising methods for generating hydrogen (Deluga et al., 2004; Ni et al., 2007; Rass-Hansen et al., 2007; Ramírez de la Piscina and Homs, 2008; Silveira et al., 2009). On the other hand, one of the biggest by-products of biodiesel production is glycerol, which may not be absorbed by the market in the future. The possibility of obtaining H2 from glycerol-reformation processes has been considered as an appropriate method for using this surplus of glycerol by-product (Kenar, 2007; Adhikari et al., 2007; Slinn et al., 2008; Dou et al., 2010; Dieuzeide and Amadeo, 2010). Although both ethanol and glycerol steam-reforming reactions are endothermic, (1) C 2 H 5 OH + 3 H 2 O → 6 H 2 + 2 CO 2 Δ H ° = 173.4 kJ mol - 1 (2) C 3 H 5 ( OH ) 3 + 3 H 2 O → 7 H 2 + 3 CO 2 Δ H ° = 123 kJ mol - 1 the introduction of an appropriate amount of oxygen lowers the energetic requirements of the steam processes due to the exothermic reaction of ethanol and glycerol partial oxidation: (3) C 2 H 5 OH + 3 / 2 O 2 → 2 CO 2 + 3 H 2 Δ H ° = - 545 kJ mol - 1 (4) C 3 H 5 ( OH ) 3 + 3 / 2 O 2 → 3 CO 2 + 4 H 2 Δ H ° = - 603 kJ mol - 1 Steam reforming of ethanol (ESR) over supported catalysts has been extensively studied and both the support and the metal itself play a key role in the catalytic performance (Ramírez de la Piscina and Homs, 2008). On the other hand, steam reforming of glycerol, especially under oxidative conditions, has been studied far less than that of bioethanol and most of the studies on glycerol reformation have been carried out in the aqueous phase (Cortright et al., 2002; Huber and Dumesic, 2006; Ramírez de la Piscina and Homs, 2008; Luo et al., 2010; Wawrzetz et al., 2010). We have analyzed the catalytic properties of unsupported Co3O4 in ESR and found that Co3O4 is activated under ESR conditions, producing promising new catalysts for this process (Llorca et al., 2004; de la Peña O’Shea et al., 2007). Recently, a study on the ESR over cobalt oxides showed the influence of the calcination temperature on the catalytic performance of the materials (Wang et al., 2009). The reduction of cobalt oxides under ESR conditions produces catalysts with better performances in the ESR than the reduction under H2, and this was attributed to a lower sintering of the metallic active phase when milder reduction conditions (ESR) were applied (Tuti and Pepe, 2008). In all cases, the use of oxide phases containing only Co generated catalysts that showed deactivation under ESR, and the formation of abundant carbonaceous deposits was determined (Tuti and Pepe, 2008; Wang et al., 2009). We have previously reported the use in the ESR of a monometallic bulk cobalt catalyst prepared by decomposition under Ar flow of the precipitate obtained by mixing Co(NO3)2 and citric acid (Martí et al., 2008). On the other hand, multi-component cobalt-based catalysts could improve the operation of the catalytic system under reforming conditions. In this context, a positive effect of a noble metal (Rh, Ru) or alkaline (K) addition to supported Co catalysts in the oxidative steam reforming (OSR) of ethanol has been reported (Brum Pereira et al., 2008, 2010). In this paper, we detail for the first time the preparation of multi-component bulk-type cobalt-based catalysts containing Ru and/or Na and their effective use for biohydrogen production by ESR and OSR of a glycerol/ethanol mixture in the 623–673K temperature range. A cyclic catalyst regeneration by successive O2 or air treatments is reported."
1,Methods,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts The following unsupported cobalt-based catalysts were prepared: (i) unpromoted bulk cobalt (Co), (ii) Na-promoted catalyst (Co(Na)), (iii) Ru-containing catalyst (Co–Ru) and (iv) Na-promoted, Ru-containing catalyst (Co–Ru(Na)). The catalysts were prepared by mixing aqueous solutions of cobalt (II) nitrate and citric acid; solutions were mixed and heated until the water had evaporated and a purple gel had formed (Saracco et al., 1996). The Na-promoted and the Ru-containing samples were prepared by appropriate impregnation of sodium carbonate and/or Ru(NO)(NO3)3 solutions onto the cobalt-containing gel; the dried samples were then milled and decomposed at 973K under argon flow to obtain porous Co-based catalysts. The decomposition under Ar of the gel formed after addition of a solution containing only Co(NO3)2 and citric acid at increasing temperatures from 523 to 973K was studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. The material was analyzed after treatment at 523K, 623K, 773K and 973K. Moreover, the thermo-decomposition process under Ar was studied by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of the gases evolved during the thermal treatment using a Micromeritics AutoChem II apparatus coupled to a Thermostar–Pfeiffer analyzer."
3,Characterization of catalysts,"2.2 Characterization of catalysts The metallic content of catalysts was determined by optical emission spectroscopy with inductively coupled plasma using a Perkin Elmer Optima 3200 RL equipment. The BET surface-area of the catalysts was determined by N2 adsorption at 77K using a Tristar-3000 Micromeritics apparatus; samples were degassed at 473K for 4h before the surface-area was measured. A Siemens D-500 X-ray diffractometer with nickel-filtered CuKα1 radiation (λ =0.15406nm) was used to record the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples. The XRD profiles were collected between 2θ =20–100°, at a step width of 0.05° counting 3s at each step. Raman spectra were recorded using a Jobin–Yvon T64000 spectrometer with an Ar ion laser as the illumination source (514.5nm) and a CCD detector cooled at 77K. The Raman spectra of the catalysts were collected between 30 and 1700cm−1 at room temperature, with the laser power limited to 2mW to minimize laser-heating effects."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests Ethanol steam reforming (ESR) and oxidative steam reforming of glycerol/ethanol were carried out at atmospheric pressure under a GHSV=3900h−1 in a Microactivity-Reference unit (PID Eng & Tech). Absolute ethanol and glycerol reagent grade from Scharlau were used. 50mg of powdered catalyst was mixed with inactive SiC (Prolabo, 0.105mm) and placed into a tubular fixed-bed reactor (305mm long, 9mm i.d., 316-L stainless steel) up to a catalytic volume of ca. 0.5ml. The temperature was measured by a thermocouple in direct contact with the catalytic bed. A piston pump was used to introduce the liquid mixture which was then vaporized and mixed with a controlled flow of desired gases. The ESR reaction was carried out with a steam to carbon (S/C) ratio of 3 and a molar ratio of He to (EtOH+H2O) of 3. The catalyst was heated to 623K under He, and then the reactor was co-fed with the vaporized ethanol–water mixture and the temperature was progressively increased to 673K. These reaction conditions were maintained for at least 12h. A similar procedure was used for the OSR of a 4.2%w/w of glycerol on ethanol mixture. In this case, an S/C ratio of 2 was used and the reaction temperature was kept at 648K; (glycerol+EtOH)/O2 =2 and inert gas/(glycerol+EtOH+H2O+O2)= 4molar ratios were used in the reactant feed. Oxygen was introduced either pure or as the equivalent flow of air, and the same contact time was maintained in both cases. The products were analyzed on-line with a Varian CP-4900 4-channel gas micro-chromatograph. The molar percentage of each product (excluding water) with respect to the total moles of products formed was calculated for each one."
5,Results and discussion,"Several characteristics of prepared multi-component bulk-type cobalt-based catalysts containing Ru and/or Na are listed in Table 1 . The characterization of materials during their preparation and the characteristics of the final catalysts follow, and their catalytic behavior is then discussed (Section 3.2)."
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization As stated in the Section 2.1, the Ar decomposition of the gel obtained by mixing Co(NO3)2 and citric acid solutions was monitored by several techniques. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns corresponding to the materials obtained by treating the gel formed at different temperatures under Ar. After a treatment at 523K, wide and low intensity XRD peaks at 2θ =36.3° and 2θ =42.3° indicated the presence of crystalline CoOfcc particles. The intensity of both peaks increased after an Ar treatment at 623K, probably because a higher amount of CoO is formed after an Ar treatment at this temperature. However, other small XRD peaks at 2θ =34.4° and 2θ =47.7° may be indicative of the simultaneous presence of CoOhcp. The formation of CoOhcp, CoOfcc, and carbon and metallic cobalt has been reported as a result of the decomposition of cobalt carboxylates in a vacuum or a nitrogen stream in the 553–593K temperature range (Redman and Steward, 1962). In contrast, the decomposition of other cobalt salts such as nitrate or carbonate, under the same conditions, formed Co3O4 and CoOfcc, respectively. It has been suggested that the products formed during carboxylate decomposition are responsible for stabilizing the CoOhcp phase (Redman and Steward, 1962). A similar explanation can be applied to the formation of CoOhcp in this study during the thermal Ar treatment of the citrate-containing gel. When the temperature was increased to 773K, metallic cobalt formed; the corresponding XRD pattern showed high intensity peaks at 2θ =44.2° and 2θ =51.5°, indicating the presence of Cofcc and low intensity peaks at 2θ =41.7° and 2θ =47.5°, which are characteristic of Cohcp Moreover, the peaks characteristic of CoO almost completely disappeared (see Fig. 1, pattern c). The pattern obtained when the temperature was subsequently increased to 973K (Fig. 1, pattern d) showed a decrease in the intensity of the peaks related to the presence of Cohcp and an increase in the intensity of those corresponding to Cofcc This was attributed to the transformation of Cohcp into Cofcc, which is the thermodynamically stable phase above 723K. The generation of carbon during the Ar treatment was followed by Raman spectroscopy. Fig. 2 shows the Raman spectra between 1200cm−1 and 1700cm−1 of the Ar-treated samples at increasing temperatures from 523 to 973K. The two wide bands indicate the presence of disordered carbon. The intensity of both bands increased with the treatment temperature up to 773K, and then decreased after a treatment at 973K. The XRD and Raman results indicate that carbon and CoO were formed during the decomposition of the gel containing Co2+ and citrate. At high temperature Co2+ may be reduced by carbon and then both Cofcc and Cohcp will be formed. As stated above, the XRD pattern of the Ar-treated sample at 973K (Fig. 1, pattern d) mainly shows the presence of peaks corresponding to Co (fcc), but small peaks due to Co(hcp) are also visible. Although Cohcp is only thermodynamically stable below 723K, and Cofcc is thermodynamically stable above this temperature, we have recently demonstrated that hcp cobalt nanoparticles are produced by reducing cobalt oxide under CO or H2 +CO mixtures and that Cohcp remains stable up to 973K. It has been proposed that the encapsulation of hexagonal cobalt nanoparticles by carbon nanofibers, which minimizes the surface energy of these cobalt structures, is responsible for these findings (de la Peña O’Shea et al., 2009). In the present study, the formation of carbon during the Ar treatment may also be related to the formation of Cohcp. As stated in the Section 2.1, the products evolved during the thermal decomposition under Ar were monitored by on-line MS analysis in a separate experiment. Fragments with M/z of 2, 16, 18, 28 and 44 which can be attributed to the formation of H2, CH4, H2O, CO and CO2 were detected. At ca. 423K, the main signal was M/z =18 although the M/z signals 2, 28 and 44 were also detected. Fig. 3 shows the MS analysis of the products evolved from 475 to 975K. In the 623–723K range, a high increase in the intensity of the M/z signals of 2, 44 and 28 was found. From the experiments carried out, it is difficult to establish the pathway of decomposition of citrate complex. However, CO, H2 and carbon formed from citrate decomposition may reduce CoO during the thermal treatment. As stated above, the XRD pattern of the sample treated at 623K (Fig. 1, pattern b) mainly showed the presence of CoO whose transformation into Co in the 623–973K range can be deduced from the corresponding XRD patterns (compare patterns b and c in Fig. 1). All catalysts were characterized after the Ar decomposition at 973K by XRD and Raman spectroscopy. All catalysts showed the unique presence of XRD peaks characteristic of hexagonal and cubic metallic cobalt, those corresponding to cubic phase being much more intense. Raman spectra of catalysts in the 300–750cm−1 zone can be used to determine the presence of Co3O4 and CoO. However, the crystallinity and particle size effects can produce a shift of the Raman bands which makes their unambiguous assignation difficult (Tang et al., 2008; Lojewska et al. 2009). The presence of a band at ca. 690cm−1 in the spectrum of Co sample and bands at 450–550cm−1 and ca. 670cm−1 in the spectrum of Co(Na) sample (spectra not shown) indicated the presence of oxidic cobalt phases in both Co and Co(Na) catalysts. The spectra of Ru-containing catalysts Co–Ru and Co–Ru(Na) did not show any band in this zone. The presence of Ru in the catalyst, irrespective of the presence of sodium, favors cobalt reduction which may improve the behavior of catalysts in oxidative reforming processes (Brum Pereira et al., 2008, 2010). On the other hand, the catalysts showed only very low intensity Raman bands in the 1200–1700cm−1 region, indicating that only small amounts of carbonaceous residue remained in the catalysts after the Ar treatment."
7,Catalytic behavior,"3.2 Catalytic behavior After the Ar-treatment, the catalysts were tested in the ESR from 623 to 673K for ca. 20h. All catalysts produced high yield of H2. Although the catalysts were selective to ESR and mainly produced H2 and CO2, other minor products were also obtained (Table 2 ). When total ethanol conversion was achieved, the H2 molar percentage with respect to the total moles of products was always above 67% (the maximum value of H2 molar percentage for ESR is 75%). In few cases where the ethanol conversion was lower than 100%, acetaldehyde and acetone were produced. Under total ethanol conversion, the main by-product was methane, whose molar percentage was lower than 8%. In some cases, ethylene (molar percentage lower than 0.3%) and CO (molar percentage lower than 3%) were also detected. However, several differences in the hydrogen yield and in the formation of minor by-products were found as a function of the catalyst used; the Co–Ru(Na) catalyst showed the best performance in the ESR conditions used in this work (Table 2). Over Co–Ru(Na) at 623K, total ethanol conversion and high yield of H2 (H2 molar percentage 74.3%) were achieved and only CH4 (molar percentage 1.9%) was obtained as by-product. Concerns in the production of hydrogen from reforming processes include the use of high reaction temperatures, the amount and type of by-products obtained and catalyst deactivation (Ramírez de la Piscina and Homs, 2008; Xuan et al., 2009). In the ESR the formation of carbon deposits is considered a main cause of deactivation and it is usually related with the formation of several by-products such as ethylene (Le Valant et al., 2010a). In this respect, it is worth emphasizing the performance of Co–Ru(Na) catalyst at a lower temperature than those usually reported and using an S/C ratio of 3. On the other hand, as stated in the introduction section, there is increasing interest in exploring OSR processes because they show a more favorable energetic balance than non-oxidative processes. Moreover, there may be a surplus of glycerol in biodiesel production in the future. These considerations and the good behavior of the unsupported Co–Ru(Na) catalyst in the ESR led us to study the OSR of a glycerol/ethanol mixture over the Co–Ru(Na) catalyst. As stated in the Section 2.3, the catalyst was tested at 648K for almost 300h. To prevent the deactivation of the catalyst by carbon deposition and to study the possibility of its regeneration, successive oxidative treatments (activation) were carried out along the catalytic test (ca. 300h); after 2h of reaction, the glycerol/ ethanol mixture was cut off and the catalyst was exposed to O2 (or air) for 0.5h (activation), then a new cycle (reaction/activation) was started. Under the above-mentioned experimental conditions, the catalytic behavior of the Co–Ru(Na) was very stable, and the ethanol and glycerol were totally converted. In Fig. 4 , the molar percentage of the products obtained is plotted as a function of the reaction time. Fig. 4 shows that no significant differences in the catalytic behavior were found by using pure oxygen or air. Besides H2 and CO2, only CH4 and CO were obtained as by-products with molar percentage values lower than 10% and 2%, respectively. The product distribution remained very stable throughout the testing time (300h). On supported cobalt catalysts, the presence of a noble metal such as Rh or Ru facilitates Co reducibility and allows the regeneration of the bimetallic catalyst through an oxidizing treatment (Brum Pereira et al., 2008, 2010). The material developed in this study constitutes a promising system for hydrogen production through reformation processes of bioresource-derived feedstock. The stable operation of the catalyst in cycles of reaction and oxidizing treatment is the main aspect to be considered, because carbon deposition is a problem that must be solved to avoid catalyst deactivation. Moreover, deactivation could be greater if raw bioethanol or bioglycerol are used; the presence of several impurities can favor carbon deposition (Slinn et al., 2008; Le Valant et al., 2010b). The possibility of carrying out cyclic activation, points to Co–Ru(Na) as an appropriate candidate to be tested in oxidative reforming of renewable raw feedstock."
8,Conclusions,"The decomposition under Ar at 623–773K of a gel obtained from Co(NO3)2 and citric acid produced fcc and hcp Co. H2, CO and C obtained during the citrate decomposition were related to the CoO reduction and the formation of cobalt phases that were catalytically active in the H2 generation from reforming processes. Co-based catalysts containing Ru and/or Na were effective in the ESR at 623K. The Co–Ru(Na) catalyst showed the best performance and it was highly effective and stable in the oxidative steam reforming of a glycerol/ethanol mixture. Its behavior was examined at 648K for 300h; cycles of reaction and activation under O2 or air were carried out."
