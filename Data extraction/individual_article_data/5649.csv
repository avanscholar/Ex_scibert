0,Introduction,"Ethanol is an attractive renewable fuel as it is non-toxic, a liquid, and can be produced from fermentation of many different substrates. Additionally, the US government has mandated the production of ethanol for energy use for several years into the future [1]. In terms of applications to fuel cells, ethanol can be converted to synthesis gas (syngas) by steam reforming, autothermal reforming, or partial oxidation. Each process has certain advantages and disadvantages depending on the application. The syngas can be used directly in a solid oxide fuel cell or it can be further processed for a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell. In this work, we investigate the partial oxidation of ethanol (reaction (1)) at millisecond contact times, also known as short contact time catalytic partial oxidation (SCT-CPO) to produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide. (1) C 2 H 5 OH + 1 / 2 O 2 → 2 CO + 3 H 2 Δ H = 14.1 kJ/mol Though the process is endothermic, it operates autothermally for two reasons. Excess oxygen is fed to the reactor to provide heat by combustion. Since the magnitude of the heat of reaction for combustion (reaction (2)) is ∼100 times that of partial oxidation (reaction (1)), only small excesses of oxygen are required avoiding loss of syngas products by oxidation. (2) C 2 H 5 OH + 3 O 2 → 2 CO 2 + 3 H 2 O Δ H = - 1277.3 kJ/mol The second factor that contributes to autothermal operation is the use of heating tapes to vaporize the ethanol. With proper heat integration, the vaporization heat is only required for start-up. In this process, oxygen (or air) is fed with ethanol over a catalyst where they react autothermally without heat input. SCT-CPO has demonstrated the ability to achieve >90% conversion of fuel with >90% selectivity to hydrogen for methane [2,3], methanol [4], ethanol [5,6], octane [7], and decane [8] over rhodium based catalysts. The process can be started in less than 10s [9] making it suitable for fast starting, transportation based applications. CPO of ethanol has been studied by several groups [10–13] at longer contact times. Only a few papers have been published on the SCT-CPO of ethanol. Salge investigated the SCT-CPO of ethanol on several different catalysts including rhodium, rhodium–ceria, and platinum [5]. All of the metals were supported on α-alumina. They found that rhodium–ceria was the superior catalyst, rhodium deteriorates in a few hours, and platinum does not achieve high conversion or selectivity. Wanat et al. studied the SCT-CPO of several different alcohols resulting in similar findings to Salge et al. in terms of Rh–Ce being a superior catalyst [6]. In this work, we have investigated platinum based catalysts rather than rhodium based catalysts due to deterioration of rhodium in less than an hour. We compare the activity of platinum catalysts to those of platinum alloyed with tin both on a zirconia support and we compare the activity of PtSn catalysts on zirconia versus alumina supports. Zirconia was chosen due to a higher C–C bond breaking activity for C2 SCT-CPO [14] and it has shown higher hydrogen selectivity and fuel conversion for methane SCT-CPO [15]. The PtSn catalysts were characterized by XRD to identify the phases present after use in the high temperature reactor."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Ceramic foams composed of α-Al2O3 or partially stabilized ZrO2 (PSZ) from HiTech Ceramics were used as supports. The supports (80 pores per linear inch (ppi), nominal surface area of ∼1.0m2/g, an average channel diameter of ∼200μm and void fraction of ∼80% [16]) were supplied in the form of cylindrical segments 10mm long and 17mm in diameter. Active metals (2wt.%) were incorporated by incipient wetness impregnation of chloroplatinic acid and tin chloride as precursors for platinum and tin respectively. The metal loaded supports were air dried and calcined for 150°C for 1h, 400°C for 2h and 600°C for 4h. Three catalysts were used in this study: platinum on zirconia (PZ), platinum and tin on zirconia (PTZ), and platinum and tin on alumina (PTA). In the case of bimetallic catalysts, the platinum and tin were loaded onto the support simultaneously."
3,Reactor set-up,"2.2 Reactor set-up An automotive fuel injector was used to obtain desired flow rates of ethanol. The injector was calibrated for various duty cycles (the percentage of time that the injector remains open) and frequency using LABVIEW (National Instruments). Formation of flames by combustion reactions is avoided by limiting other homogeneous reactions before the catalyst using the fuel injector [5]. The gas flows of oxygen and nitrogen were controlled separately using thermal mass flow controllers (Tylan) and calibrated to achieve a desirable ethanol/oxygen ratio. The reactor was a quartz tube 40cm long and 1.8cm inner diameter. Ethanol was kept in a pressurized container at 5psi. Ethanol was introduced at room temperature and vaporized at the pre-heating zone of the reactor. The pre-heating zone consists of a 10cm length of the reactor that is wrapped in heating tape. The outside wall of the reactor was maintained at ∼150°C using a variable transformer to control and a thermocouple placed in between the reactor and heating tape to monitor the temperature. The reactor was run at atmospheric pressure. Blank ceramic foams were wrapped with silica alumina cloth and placed inside the pre-heating zone of the reactor to improve the mixing of oxygen and fuel. The catalyst was sandwiched between two blank uncoated ceramic foams to prevent the loss of heat due to radiation. A thermocouple is placed on the back face of the catalyst to monitor the changes in the temperature. This set-up is identical to one previously published [17]. The total flow rate was 4.78slpm (oxygen flow rate-1.3slpm, nitrogen flow rate-3.5slpm and ethanol flow rate-1.95slpm) for C/O ratio of 1.5. The oxygen flow rate is reduced to 1.075slpm and 0.918slpm for C/O ratios of 1.78 and 2.1 respectively. The reactor is started by turning on the pre-heat zone heating tapes, followed by introducing the ethanol, nitrogen, and oxygen into the reactor. A Bunsen burner is lit and placed immediately next to the catalyst zone. The temperature shoots up from 200°C to 900°C within seconds and the Bunsen burner was removed. The reactor is wrapped with a high temperature insulation. Once the reactor reached steady-state the product gases are sampled through gas syringe from the reactor outlet."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization 2.3.1 Catalytic activity The product gases were analyzed using a dual column gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890). One column is highly selective for air separation and carbon-monoxide and the other column is selective for carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons. Nitrogen is used as a calibration standard to calculate the response factors for other species. The carbon balance is closed to within ±5%. The oxygen and hydrogen balances were closed around water and hydrogen respectively. The selectivity is defined as the amount of C or H in a certain product divided by total C or H in all of the products. In this work, the selectivity of molecular hydrogen is with respect to elemental hydrogen, whereas all other selectivities are with respect to carbon. Conversion of ethanol is defined as the ratio of the amount of ethanol consumed in the reactor over that which is fed to the reactor. All data points were repeated three times. The average of these data points are shown in the figures below. The C/O ratio reported herein is the amount of carbon in ethanol compared to the amount of oxygen in molecular oxygen without accounting for the oxygen in ethanol. 2.3.2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) X-ray diffraction (X’Pert PRO model from PANalytical) was performed using CuKα radiation at a current of 40mA and a voltage of 45kV. The samples were scanned over range of 2θ from 10° to 90° in reflection–transmission mode with a step size of 0.016° and a rate of 0.024°/sec."
5,Results,
6,Reactor data – catalytic activity,"3.1 Reactor data – catalytic activity The products obtained from the reactor include carbon dioxide, ethane, ethylene, water, ethanol, acetaldehyde, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane. Fig. 1 shows the ethanol conversion for PZ, PTZ, and PTA catalysts as a function of C/O ratio. The PtSn catalysts showed a greater conversion of ethanol than the platinum catalyst with the zirconia supported bimetallic achieving a conversion of 82.5% at a C/O ratio of 1.5. This is the highest conversion achieved by any catalyst. The conversion drops as the C/O ratio increases for all catalysts. This would be expected as the feed stoichiometry favors less total oxidation which increases the ethanol conversion at low C/O ratios. As the ratio increases, the PTA shows a greater conversion than the PTZ catalyst. The PZ catalyst always shows a lower conversion than the bimetallic catalysts. The back face temperatures of the catalysts as a function of C/O ratio are shown in Fig. 2 . For all catalysts, the back face temperature decreases as the C/O ratio increases. For all ratios, the temperature is highest for PTZ and lowest for PZ. Fig. 3 shows the selectivity of carbon to form acetaldehyde. The PTZ and PTA catalysts show the greatest selectivity for acetaldehyde, while PZ shows the smallest at all C/O ratios. At the lowest C/O ratio, the PTZ and PTA catalysts have the same selectivity, while the PTA catalyst shows a greater selectivity as the C/O ratio increases. Based on the stoichiometry, it is expected that the acetaldehyde selectivity will increase as the C/O ratio increases. The smaller amounts of oxygen in the feed at higher C/O ratios make it more difficult to oxidize to carbon oxides. Fig. 4 shows the selectivity to hydrogen for all three catalysts. The PTZ catalyst demonstrates the highest selectivity at all C/O ratios ranging from 40% at the lowest C/O to 25% at the highest C/O ratio. The PTA catalyst demonstrates the lowest selectivity never going above 15%. As the C/O ratio increases, the amount of hydrogen decreases for all three catalysts. Fig. 5 shows the selectivities of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. In all cases, the selectivity to CO decreases as the C/O ratio increases. The PTZ and PTA catalysts demonstrate a selectivity that is similar for the two supports and about 5–10% higher than the PZ catalyst. The carbon dioxide selectivity initially increases then decreases as the C/O ratio increases for the PTZ and PZ catalysts, but shows a constant decrease on the PTA catalyst. The PTZ and PZ catalysts always show a greater selectivity to carbon dioxide than the PTA catalyst. Fig. 6 shows the carbon selectivity of the final major product, ethylene. The PZ and PTZ catalysts show a constant selectivity to ethylene with the PTZ catalyst exhibiting a selectivity near 1%, while the PZ catalyst demonstrates a selectivity around 11%. The PTA catalyst has the greatest selectivity, but it decreases significantly from 19% to 10% as the C/O ratio increases. The methane and ethane selectivities are not shown for any of the catalysts as they do not exceed 3% for any C/O ratio."
7,X-ray diffraction,"3.2 X-ray diffraction X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained for the PTA and PTZ catalysts to identify the presence of platinum–tin phases present on the catalyst. Samples were taken from the back of the catalyst. The X-ray diffractograms show many peaks corresponding to platinum and tin phases. There are several peaks from the support and since the metal loading is about 2wt.% the non-overlapping peaks which are identified to be from the Pt–Sn alloys are small. In both figures, the diffractogram for the catalyst and for the blank support are shown to help identify the platinum–tin peaks and observe when they do or do not overlap with the support. XRD of the PTZ used catalyst as shown in Fig. 7 shows the presence of the PtSn phase only. Prominent non-overlapping peaks of the PtSn phase occur at 2θ’s of ∼25 {100}, 30.0 {101}, 41.8 {102} and 44.1 {110}. Many peaks of the PtSn phase overlap with the PSZ support and some of them are found at angles 54.1 {201}, 57.0 {103}, 68.8 {004} and 74.8 {203}. XRD of the PTA used catalyst (Fig. 8 ) showed non-overlapping peaks of the orthorhombic PtSn4 phase at 2θ’s of ∼15.51, 20.94, 30.71, 31.19, 31.99, 44.12 and 45.42 which correspond to the {002}, {111}, {113}, {004}, {022}, {115}, and {311} planes respectively. The overlapping peaks of the PtSn4 with the alumina support at 2θ’s of ∼42.58, 59.66 and 66.51 correspond to the {204}, {042}, and {333} planes respectively. Peaks for the PtSn2 cubic phase are also found on the PTA used catalyst at 2θ’s of ∼23.96 {111}, 46.74 {311}, 71.70 {422}, which do not overlap with the alumina peaks. Overlapping peaks occur at angles of 39.64 {220}, 64.57 {420} and 76.88 {511}."
8,Discussion,
9,Platinum vs. rhodium catalysts,"4.1 Platinum vs. rhodium catalysts A detailed analysis of previous results on rhodium and platinum based catalysts shows that the PTZ catalyst may be as good as rhodium. Wanat et al. [6] found that at a C/O ratio of 1.5, a rhodium catalyst achieved a conversion of 80% and a hydrogen selectivity of 80%. In the results reported in this paper, the conversion is also 80%, but the selectivity is about half, 40%. However, Salge et al. [5] found that platinum and rhodium-cerium obtained the same selectivity at a C/O ratio of 1.5 (as we have defined it). (Our group has found significant differences in activity due to supports from different batches. Even though we use the same monoliths as the references reported above, we did not try to recreate their results for the sake of comparison due to batch–to–batch differences in supports.) We did try to obtain data for a rhodium catalyst, but the reactor deactivated in less than an hour. When the catalyst was removed, it was in the form of a powder with most of the foam structure being gone."
10,PtSn alloy formation,"4.2 PtSn alloy formation There have been many studies of PtSn alloy formation on alumina [18–21]. From reading the literature, it seems that there is no consensus on the presence of PtSn alloys. It is important to note that almost all of these studies have looked at γ-alumina and not α-alumina or zirconia as has been done here. Several researchers have observed definite alloy formation on silica [22–24], so it is not unreasonable to expect alloy formation on α-alumina or zirconia. It is also important to note that the XRD data herein were taken from the back of the catalytic monolith. Given the product profile we have observed and the fact that oxidation reactions take place near the beginning of the monolith [25,26], it is highly likely that we would observe a PtSn alloy as opposed to segregated oxides near the back of these supports. The only other XRD studies of a similar catalyst was done by Yokoyama et al. [27] and Bodke and Schmidt [28]. Both investigated a platinum–tin catalyst on the same α-alumina support and they found a platinum rich alloy. In either work, the diffractogram is not shown and they do not identify from which part of the catalyst the sample was taken."
11,Pt vs. Pt/Sn,"4.3 Pt vs. Pt/Sn On the zirconia support, there was a major difference in the product profiles for PZ versus PTZ catalysts. The PTZ catalyst showed higher selectivities to carbon monoxide and hydrogen whereas the PZ catalyst showed more ethylene produced. Both catalysts showed similar conversion and selectivity to acetaldehyde. Given the product profiles, we believe that both catalysts initially dehydrogenate ethanol to acetaldehyde. On the PTZ catalyst, the acetaldehyde more easily undergoes carbon–carbon bond cleavage through decarbonylation to methane and carbon monoxide. The methane is reformed further to syngas. The PZ catalyst has more difficulty breaking the C–C bond and dehydrates the aldehyde to ethylene. McCabe et al. found that either pathway, decarbonylation or dehydration, is possible on Pt based catalysts [29]. These reactor results are contrary to those found previously by Yokoyama et al. [27]. They found that PtSn is better at desorbing ethylene than Pt alone. It is important to note that their starting hydrocarbon was ethane and not ethanol. They also found platinum enriched phases on their catalyst whereas we found only the equimolar PtSn phase. It would not be surprising that the aldehyde would react differently than the alkane on the surface leading to major deviations from previous work. In this work, the aldehyde is an intermediate between the fuel and alkene. We have found that the carbon–carbon bond breakage is easier than dehydration to the alkene on PTZ versus PZ. Coq and Figueras found that tin addition to a platinum catalyst enhances carbon–carbon breakage in C5 and C6 cycloalkanes and cycloalkenes [30]. They claim that tin dilutes the platinum leading to enhanced carbon–carbon bond rupture. This would help to explain our findings and we further believe this shift in the product selectivities may be due to the Pt–Pt interatomic distances on the two catalysts. In an equimolar PtSn alloy, the Pt–Pt bond distance is 2.72 angstroms versus 2.77 angstroms for the metallic platinum catalyst [31]. The contraction in interatomic distances would make it easier for the PtSn catalyst to adsorb both carbons in the aldehyde to break the bond, instead of only bonding one carbon which would more easily lead to dehydration. Miller et al. found that a contraction of 0.15 angstroms in a gold catalyst greatly changed the activity [32], so it is reasonable to expect a 0.05Å contraction to have a noticeable effect as well. The difference in Pt–Pt bond distances is only ∼2.5%, so we expect changes in flux through a pathway rather than turning on or off of a pathway."
12,Pt/Sn on different supports,"4.4 Pt/Sn on different supports The major difference in the PtSn catalysts on different supports is the phase of the alloy. The PTZ catalyst contains the PtSn phase whereas the PTA catalyst contains the tin enriched phases, PtSn2 and PtSn4. This leads to a change in the selectivity of all products except the acetaldehyde. In fact, the results for PtSn on alumina look similar to those of the PZ catalyst. The only difference is a tradeoff of higher ethylene and acetaldehyde selectivity and lower CO2 selectivity on PTA versus PZ. We have shown in a previous paper [14] that these zirconia supports are highly acidic and capable of decomposing ethylene (and likely acetaldehyde due to the pi bond) to carbon oxides. This is only a possible explanation. Given that the PtSn2 and PtSn4 phases experience a surface enrichment by tin [33], they may not be relatively active and it is entirely possible that this catalyst is acting like a platinum catalyst. Since the catalyst was loaded with a 1:1 mixture of platinum to tin and the XRD results only show tin enriched alloys, it is likely that there is a significant amount of free platinum that could be catalyzing the reaction regardless of the activity of the tin enriched phases. The discrepancy in acetaldehyde, ethylene, and carbon dioxide selectivities can be explained by the activity of the zirconia support to decompose ethylene to carbon followed by oxidation to carbon dioxide."
13,Conclusions,"On zirconia supports, PtSn catalysts form an equimolar PtSn phase, which is more active for syngas production than the pure platinum catalyst. The smaller interatomic distance between Pt atoms in the bimetallic versus the pure platinum leads to a greater rate of carbon–carbon bond breakage in the aldehyde intermediate. In both cases, the ethanol conversion and acetaldehyde selectivities are similar. The pure platinum catalyst converts more of the acetaldehyde to ethylene compared to the bimetallic catalyst. On alumina, tin enrich platinum phases (PtSn2 and PtSn4) are formed, which show similar activity to pure platinum. Due to the surface enrichment by tin, it is not possible to rule out that they are much less active than pure platinum and that most of the activity of these catalysts comes from pure platinum not taking part in alloy formation. The difference in carbon selectivities for the PZ and PTA catalysts could then be explained by activity of the zirconia support in PZ to decompose ethylene to carbon dioxide. Though these catalysts do not achieve the same conversion as a rhodium based catalyst, they were stable over many hours and did not show any signs of support disintegration."
