0,Introduction,"In the catalytic reactions, the simplicity of the processes, enabling moderate reaction conditions, high catalytic activity and selectivity make the hydrogen transfer reactions (TH) a preferred way of transferring hydrogen into a system [1]. The extended method used in reducing ketone derivatives to related alcohols is TH reactions. The catalytic TH reactions of ketone are the main and key step for the production of a wide variety of alcohols, including chiral compounds, which are valuable products and precursors for the pharmaceutical, pesticide, flavor, fragrance, material and sensitive chemical industries [2]. In this reaction, the most preferred of 2-propanol; its superior properties such as a source of hydrogen and solvent, reliability, high selectivity, cheapness, accessibility, easy removal of the product resulting from the reaction and environmental friendliness were effective [3]. Besides, TH reactions are equilibrium reactions and the efficiency of the reduction-oxidation pathways are largely dependent on concentration molecule (donor/acceptor) and thermodynamic stability of relevant molecule in equilibrium [4]. These reduction processes, which do not contain molecular hydrogen, deserve a prominent position in the ranks of chemical transformation. It can be envisaged that the application requirements will increase even more for the production of not only synthetic but also fine chemicals. It attracts the attention of researchers due to the easy binding of nitrogen containing ligands with transition metals, their preparation at high efficiency, the potential of Ru(II) complexes prepared with ligands containing N-donor atoms to increase the catalytic reaction of organic compounds. This property is seen in numerous ruthenium complexes for the hydrogen transfer reaction of ketones as catalyst precursors [5]. The half-sandwich RuII-(arene) complexes are essential as catalysts such as in alkylation, amination, hydrogenation, hydroformylation and isomerization reactions [6]. The catalyst design provides significant advantages in high yield and selectivity in many catalytic reactions. In particular, ruthenium complexes coordinated with ligands such as NN [7], NNN [8], NO [9], CNN [10] are frequently used in this field. The TH reactions by catalyzed half-sandwich RuII(η6-arene) complexes which the pioneering work by Noyori and Ikariya et al. [11], have been very attractive subject because of the advantages over classical hydrogenation [12] and the trend in these work is dedicated to increase or alter their selectivity, stability and activity by steric and electronic properties. The π-acceptor nitrogen-containing ligands such as N-heteroaromatic structure like pyridine- or quinoline-based chelating diamine bidentate ligand 2-(N-aromatic structure)-1H-benzimidazoles on ruthenium center in complex have enlarged the scope of TH reactions because of these NN-type ligands can be readily derivatized and strongly bonded to metal [3b,7a,13]. In such ligands, the electronic and steric properties on the benzimidazol can be easily modified. Also, this area has attracted increasing interest related to environmentally sustainable processing, simple product separation, and pH dependent selectivity in aqueous medium [14]. For example, the RuII complexes [(p-cymene)Ru(NΛN)(OH2)]2+, [(η6-C6Me6)Ru(phen)Cl]+ and [(p-cymene)Ru(NΛN)Cl]+ where NΛN are pyridine-based ligands and phen is 1,10-phenanthroline and other related complexes [3b,15] have been shown to catalyze the reduction of ketones (such as cyclohexanone and acetophenone) to alcohols and imines [16]. The research for TH reactions and efficient catalysts continues to create great interest in ruthenium catalysis. In spite of many efficient the ruthenium complexes based benzimidazole ligands which are biologically effective and medicinally significant compounds [17] have been investigated [3b,7a,18], the availability of metal complexes containing 2-(2′-quinolyl)benzimidazoles remains limited, and only few examples have been published [7a,19]. In this report we expand on previous work involving the use of the half-sandwich RuII complexes that contain benzyl substituted 2-(2′-quinolyl)benzimidazole ligands and illuminate structural characterization with X-ray diffraction technique (Fig. 1 ) [7a], we herein report the synthesis of ruthenium complexes, their thermal and electrochemical properties and also their catalytic studies in the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone."
1,Experimental,
2,General considerations,"2.1 General considerations L 1 , L 2 and [(η6-p-cymene)Ru(μ-Cl)]2 dimer were obtained according to the published procedure in the literature [7a,20]. Information about the devices and techniques used is given in the supporting information section."
3,Synthesis of ligands,"2.2 Synthesis of ligands 2.2.1 General procedure for synthesis of 2-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)quinoline (L 1 ) and 2-(5,6-dimethyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)quinoline (L 2 ) Quinaldic acid (20.0 mmol, 3.46 g) and corresponding diamine derivative (20.0 mmol) (o-phenylenediamine, 2.163 g or 4,5-dimethyl-o-phenylenediamine, 2.724 g) were stirred in polyphosphoric acid (PPA) (40 mL) for 4h at 200 °C under argon. At the end this time, the green-colored molten fluid was poured into iced water. Then the ammonium hydroxide was added to make the pH: 9 and obtaining solid was filtered off. The precipitate was boiled with EtOH for 2h with activated charcoal. Finally, the product was recrystallized by EtOH. For characterization data L 1 and L 2 , please see supporting materials. 2.2.2 General procedure for the synthesis of other N^N-type ligands (L 3-14 ) L 3 -L 8 ligands were synthesized starting from L 1 while L 9 -L 14 ligands were synthesized starting from L 2 by modification of the literature procedure [7a,21]. L 1 (10.0 mmol, 2.45 g) or L 2 (10.0 mmol, 0.27 g) and KOH (10.0 mmol, 0.56 g) were stirred in a Schlenk tube at 40 °C for 2h in PhMe. At the end of the time, the corresponding benzyl halide derivative (11.0 mmol) (benzyl bromide, 1.92 g; 2-methylbenzyl chloride, 1.56 g; 2,4,6-trimethylbenzyl chloride, 1.86 g; 2,3,5,6-tetramethylbenzyl chloride, 2.01 g; 2,3,4,5,6-pentamethylbenzyl chloride, 2.16 g; 1-(chloromethyl)naphthalene, 2.00 g) was added to the reaction mixture and the mixture was refluxed for 8h. The solvent was removed in vacuo, and the residue was filtered by adding CH2Cl2. The filtrate was allowed to crystallize by adding hexane. For characterization data L 3 -L 14 , please see supporting materials."

5,X-ray crystallography,"2.4 X-ray crystallography Intensity data of the compounds were collected with a STOE IPDS II diffractometer at room temperature using graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation by applying the ω-scan method. Data collection and cell refinement were carried out using X-AREA [22] while data reduction was applied using X-RED32 [22]. The structure solutions were obtained using SIR2019 [23] and SHELXL-2018 [24] was applied for the refinements. The coordinates of the water H atom were determined from a difference Fourier map and refined freely [O─H = 0.85(4)-0.88(3) Å]. The remaining H atoms were inserted in idealized positions and treated using a riding model, fixing the bond lengths at 0.86, 0.93, 0.97 and 0.96 Å for NH, CH, CH2 and CH3 atoms, respectively. The displacement parameters of the H atoms were fixed at U iso(H) = 1.2U eq (1.5U eq for CH3). The crystallographic data and refinement parameters are summarized in Table 1 . OLEX2 [25] was used to prepare artwork representations."
6,Results and discussions,
7,Synthesis and characterization of compounds,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization of compounds 2-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)quinoline (L 1 , QuBim) [20] and 2-(5,6-dimethyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)quinoline (L 2 , QuDmBim) [26] substances also used as chelating ligands were synthesized in moderate to high yield in a single step from commerically available quinaldic acid and corresponding diamine derivative o-phenylenediamine or 4,5-dimethyl-o-phenylenediamine in polyphosphoric acid (PPA), respectively. L 3 - 14 ligands (N^N-type) which are N-substitution products were synthesized in alkaline solution with various benzylhalide derivatives (Scheme 1 ). The compounds, L 3 and L 6 of the N-substituted products were previously synthesized by Dayan et al. (Fig. 1) [7a]. The NMR characterization data of L 1-3 and L 6 compounds matched those reported in the literature. Other ligands and ruthenium complexes synthesized from them are new in the literature. The half-sandwich Ru(II) complexes (C 1-14 ) corresponding to L 1 - 14 ligands were synthesized from a 2:1 mixture of ligand and [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 in ethanol and were isolated in high yields. All analyzes including NMR data (1H and 13C) are presented in the supporting information. Furthermore, the solid-state structures of L 2 , L 4 , L 12 and L 14 were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. However, we tried to obtain the complex crystal for the X-ray difraction studies, but we could not obtain a suitable crystal. L 1-14 and C 1 - 14 compounds were soluble in commonly used solvents such as MeOH, EtOH, DMF, DMSO and CH2Cl2. The NH peaks in QuBim (L 1 ) and QuDmBim (L 2 ) were appeared a signals at δ 13.25 and δ 13.0 ppm as a broad singlet in the 1H NMR spectra of compounds, respectively. The aromatic protons of QuBim (L 1 ) compound in the spectra, along with signals due to the two aromatic fragments which are benzimidazol and quinoline moiety, in the region of δ 7.25–7.61 and δ 7.81–8.49 ppm were seen, while QuDmBim (L 2 ) was seen in the range of δ 7.39–7.51 and δ 7.51–8.44 ppm, respectively. In addition, the methyl protons in the benzimidazol skeleton in QuDmBim (L 2 ) were seen at δ 2.29 ppm. The main difference that separates the 1H NMR spectra L 3 - 14 which are N-substitution products from L 1 and L 2 is loss of the NH proton in the benzimidazol fragment and formation of new peaks of benzylic CH2 protons. The benzylic CH2 protons were observed as singlet peaks around δ 6.18–6.48 ppm in L 3-14 compounds. In addition, the aromatic protons belonging to benzylic groups in compounds L 3-14 were monitored around δ 6.25–8.55 ppm. The main difference of half-sandwich Ru(II) complexes (C 1 - 14 ) from ligands (L 1-14 ) is the emergence of new peaks belonging to p-cymene groups in the 1H NMR spectra. The ruthenium complexes, C 1 and C 2 synthesized from the non-N-substituted ligands, L 1 and L 2 , of which complex, C 2 is novel. The protons of p-cymene groups of C 1 and C 2 were observed as doublet of doublets at δ 0.72 ppm and δ 0.65 ppm belonging to CH3 in isopropyl group, as multiplet δ 2.18–2.25 ppm and δ 2.07–2.18 ppm belonging to CH in isopropyl group, as singlet at δ 2.30 ppm belonging to CH3 the same for both complexes, as doublets at δ 6.13, 6.27, 6.34 (dd) ppm and δ 6.05, 6.20, 6.27, 6.36 ppm belonging to aromatic CH, respectively. It is thought that some unusual peaks are seen due to complex symmetry in 1H NMR spectra for C 1 and C 2 . This is also supported by 13C NMR spectra and there are six peaks some of which doublets for aromatic CH and CH3 in isopropyl group. The protons in benzimidazole and quinoline skeletons of L 1 and L 2 were observed to generally shifted downfield after complexation. In the 1H NMR spectra of C2, the peak of the NH proton in the structure was not observed as in the C 1 complex [7a]. This situation can be explained by the fact that C 1 and C 2 have an ionic character. After all these determinations, when looking at other the half-sandwich Ru(II) complexes (C 3-14 ), 1H NMR spectra were more complicated due to the excess of aromatic protons. Besides, similar slopes are also observed 1H and 13C NMR spectra of C 3-8 and C 9-14 complex series. The larger data can be found in the supporting information for all compounds. The ESI-MS chromatograms of C 2 , C 8 , C 10 and C 14 ionic complexes are given in the supporting information section. In the mass spectra of C 2 complex consisting of 2-(5,6-dimethyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)quinoline (L 2 ) ligand and auxiliary ligands (Cl and p-cymene), mass fragmentation was the result of separation of the Cl group that remained outside the coordination sphere [M-Cl]+ peak was observed at 544.28. Similarly, [M-Cl]+ peaks for other complexes (C 8 , C 10 and C 14 ) were observed in high abundance at 656.218, 648.38 and 684.39, respectively. In addition, lower abundances of [M+ + 2H] and [M + Cl] peaks were observed in all the mentioned complexes. The NH and CN streching vibration bands were determined at 3484 and 1618 cm−1 for L 1 , at 3495 and 1617 cm−1 for L 2 , respectively. The main differences of L 3-14 from L 1 and L 2 used as starting materials are loss of the NH band and the presence of aliphatic stretching bands relation to CH2 in benzylic group between 2962 and 3017 cm−1. The CN streching vibration bands of L 3 -L 14 were observed at the region of 1611–1618 cm−1. In addition to the observation of the new peaks of the p-cymene group after the formation of the half-sandwich Ru(II) complexes (C 1 - 14 ), the CN stretching vibration bands shifted slightly compared to ligands (1618 cm−1 for C 1 , 1617 cm−1 for C 2 , 1614 cm−1 for C 3 , 1615 cm−1 for C 4 , 1616 cm−1 for C 5 , 1618 cm−1 for C 6 , 1620 cm−1 for C 7 , 1617 cm−1 for C 8 , 1620 cm−1 for C 9 , 1622 cm−1 for C 10 , 1620 cm−1 for C 11 , 1621 cm−1 for C 12 , 1620 cm−1 for C 13 , 1622 cm−1 for C 14 ). In the FT-IR spectra of Ru(II) complexes, C1-14, were also seen broad band in the range of about 3300–3450 cm−1 relation to strecthing bands from water molecules. The half-sandwich Ru(II) complexes in solid form have partially hyrgroscopic properties. In UV–Vis spectra of QuBim(L 1 ), QuDmBim(L 2 ) and derived from them the other ligands (L 3-14 ), the peaks belonging to π→π∗ and n→π∗ transitions were monitored around 306–361 nm. This transitions are red-shifted with the complexation and new charge transfer band belonging Ru(π)→ dπ∗ CT occurred around 373–389 nm."
8,Description of the crystal structures,"3.2 Description of the crystal structures The structures of the L 2 , L 4 , L 12 and L 14 ligands were obtained by SXRD studies. The molecular diagrams of L 2 , L 4 , L 12 and L 14 with the atom-numbering scheme are depicted in Fig. 2 , while important bond distances and angles are listed in Table 2 in the supporting information section. The planes of the benzimidazole and the quinoline, being linked by ortho carbon atoms, are almost coplanar with a dihedral angle of 3.36(7)° in L 2 , 4.77(6)° in L 4 and 3.04(13)° in L 14 . whilst these planes are inclined at an angle of 33.77(7)° in L 12 . In addition, the benzene ring in L 4 and L 12 and the naphthalene ring in L 14 make dihedral angles of 89.53(9) and 85.71(8)° in L 4 , 83.25(7) and 61.85(7)° in L 12 and 85.46(14) and 88.42(15)° in L 14 with the benzimidazole and the quinoline ring planes, respectively. Although the N1─C1 bond is slightly longer than the typical imino CN bond, the bond lengths and angles are standard [27] and agree well with the literature values [7a,26,28-32]. In all compounds, imine nitrogen atoms of benzimidazole and quinoline moieties are placed in trans position. This very likely reduces electrostatic interaction of the lone pairs of the imine nitrogen atoms and also serves to prevent a steric clash of the H atom at the 3-position of the quinoline ring with the amino or methylene H atom at the 1-position of the benzimidazole ring [31]. In the molecular structure of L 2 , no intramolecular interactions exist. In the crystal structure of L 2 , the benzimidazole-quinoline molecule is linked to water molecule by means of an N─H⋯O hydrogen bond, while the water molecule is linked it via two O─H⋯N interactions. There are also face-to-face π···π stacking interactions in which the interplanar distances between benzimidazole and quinoline rings are in the range 3.6388(14)-3.8714(15) Å (Fig. 3 a, in the supporting information section). In the molecular structures of L 4 , L 12 and L 14 , an intramolecular C─H⋯N contact leads to the formation of six-membered ring with graph-set descriptor S(6) [33]. In the crystal structure of L 4 and L 12 , no classic hydrogen bonds are found. Instead, there are face-to-face π···π stacking interactions (Figs. 3b and 4a , in the supporting information section) in which the interplanar distances between benzimidazole and quinoline rings change from 3.6264(12) to 3.7023(11) Å in L 4 and the interplanar distances between benzimidazole rings range from 3.7812(16) to 3.9035(15) Å in L 4 . In the case of L 14 , neither classic hydrogen bonds nor other weak interactions are observed. As a result, van der Waals interactions stabilize the molecular packing (Fig. 4b, in the supporting information section). Full details of the hydrogen-bonding geometry are given in Table 3 in the supporting information section."
9,The thermal behavior of the ruthenium complexes,"3.3 The thermal behavior of the ruthenium complexes The TGA curves of the ruthenium complexes (C 1-14 ) were obtained at heating rate of 20 °C/min in the temperature range of 50–1000 °C under N2 atmosphere. The thermoanalytical data of the complexes are summarized in Table 4 . TGA curves of some selected complexes are given in Fig. 5 . The TGA curves of the complexes show decomposition temperatures above 200 °C. In the TGA curves of C 1 and C 2 , the first mass loss in the range 50–387 °C is attributed to the quinoline fragment of L 1 (or L 2 ). In the second step, the benzimidazole fragment of L 1 (or L 2 ) ligand and cymene ligand of C 1 (or C 2 ) complex undergoes decomposition in the temperature range 326–1000 °C. The complex exhibits a residue above 1000 °C, corresponding two chloride and ruthenium. Thermal behaviors of C 3 and C 4 display two decomposition steps which give lower thermal stability in the presence of the benzyl groups on benzimidazole of L 3 (or L 4 ) ligand. In the first step, the mass loss of the complexes C 3 and C 4 (32.52–33.25%) were observed due to the elimination of the benzimidazole with benzyl moiety for C 3 and methyl groups on benzyl moiety for C 4 . Finally, mass loss (28.98–29.36%) of complexes in the temperature range 338–1000 °C shows the removal of the quinoline group of ligand and alkyl groups (CH3+ CH(CH3)2) of cymene. After this decomposition step, the mass loss is around 62% up to 1000 °C. The residue with the mass 37.77–38.12% may be assigned to benzene ring, two chloride and ruthenium. The decomposition temperature ranges and the percentage of mass loss of the complexes (C 1 -C 10, C 12 -C 14 ) are given in Table 4. The obtained results indicate that the synthesized complexes have high thermal stability required for catalyst applications."
10,Electrochemical data,"3.4 Electrochemical data The cyclic voltammograms of the complexes (C 1, C 2, C 8 and C 14 ) show one oxidation at around 1.27 V (Fig. 6 a). The extent of the oxidation peak can be attributed to the contribution of ruthenium metal as the main character and p-cymene to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) [34]. The oxidation peaks of the complexes (C 8, C 14 ) are slightly shifted to anodic area in the presence of N-naphtyl substituent on 2-(2′-quinolyl)benzimidazoles ligands. The HOMO energy levels of the complexes (EHOMO) were determined using the maximum of first oxidation potentials (EHOMO = -e(E1/2(ox.) - E1/2(Fe) + 4.8)) [35]. The LUMO energy levels of C 1-14 (ELUMO) were determined from the equation E LUMO = E HOMO + Eg where Eg is optical band gap (Eg) [36]. The energy levels of HOMO and LUMO for the complexes are in the range of −5.57 to −5.67 eV and −2.50 to −2.71 eV, respectively. The corresponding data are summarized in Table 5 . The consecutive voltammograms were obtained to investigate electrochemical stable of the complexes. In anodic area, there is no an important change in peak currents and potentials (Fig. 6b). This shows the electrochemically stable of molecules. The computational calculations of EHOMO, ELUMO and band gap of the complexes (C 1 and C 8 ) were performed in gas phase and data are summarized in Table 6 . The HOMO orbitals of complex 1 are delocalized over ruthenium metal and p-cymene and LUMO is composed of L 1 ligand. In comparion of the obtained theoretical results, the difference between the theoretical (in gas phase) and the experimental data (in solution phase) was observed for complexes 1 and 8 (Fig. 7 ). The difference of the electrochemical parameters in gas and solution phases may be attributed to an intrinsic resistance of electrolyte solution in the electrochemical cell [37]."
11,Catalytic studies,"3.5 Catalytic studies The catalytic transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone was investigated by the synthesized half-sandwich RuII complexes (C 1-14 ) as catalyst. The catalytic experiments were performed in a 15 mL two-necked round bottomed flask equipped with magnetic stirrer and condenser. All catalytic experiments were tested under identical conditions to allow comparison of results. For this, a typical catalytic reaction were carried out at 82 °C in open air using catalyst, C 1-14 (0.01 mmol), KOH (4 mmol) as co-catalyst, acetophenone (1 mmol) and 2-propanol (4 ml) as a source of hydrogen and solvent, taking into account the pre-determined optimum conditions for transfer hydrogenation with this similar type catalyst, the best ratio of S/C/B [3b]. All catalytic reactions were monitored by GC. The results showed that the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone could be obtained with high efficiency for all catalysts (C 1-14 ). The catalytic results are given in Fig. 8 . When the values in the Fig. 8 are examined, the best results were obtained with C 1 and C 2 . This inference may be related to NH functionality. However, the presence of methyl groups at the 5,6-positions in the benzimidazole skeleton in the ligand structure (2-(5,6-dimethyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)quinoline, L 2 ) in the C 2 complex appears to reduce catalytic activity to some extent. The N-H protons at C 1 and C 2 may play an important role in the transfer hydrogenation mechanism via metal-ligand cooperativity. Namely, at the transition state, hydrogen bonding ability between N-H protons and catalytic species (ketones or IPA) (Fig. 9 ) may increase catalytic activity compared to C 2 -C 14 analogs [38]. Looking at other complex series (C 3 -C 7 and C 9 -C 13 ), the catalytic activity appears to depend not only on the quinolinyl-benzimidazole skeleton of the ligand structures but also on the benzyl fragment of the ligands. Interestingly, the efficiency of the catalyst decreases due to the number of methyl groups as electron donating group in the aromatic ring introduce to the benzyl fragment. C 8 and C 14 complexes containing naphtyl group on the nitrogen atom in benzimidazole skeleton in ligand structure showed close activity to each other."
12,Conclusion,"In this work, we reported the preparation and characterization of a series of the half-sandwich RuII complexes, [RuCl(L1-14)(η6-p-cymene)]Cl; (C 1-14 ) with bidentate ligands (L 1-14 ) containing 2-(2′-quinolyl)benzimidazole derivative and their catalytic activities for hydrogen transfer reaction of acetophenone with the use of 2-propanol in the presence of KOH under open air. Besides, the thermal and electrochemical properties of the selected ruthenium complexes were investigated. Four novel ligand (L 2 , L 4 , L 12 and L 14 ) were structurally characterized with single crystal X-ray diffraction. The catalytic reactions show that C 1 and C 2 are more efficient catalyst than other C 3-14 for TH of acetophenone. Generally, the efficiency of the catalyst seems to depend on the steric and electronic parameters of L 3-14 . When ruthenium complexes are compared; depending on the number and positions of the electron donor methyl groups on phenyl substituent in the C 3 -C 7 and C 9 -C 13 series, besides the presence of methyl groups in the 5,6-positions of the benzimidazole for C 9 -C 13 series, decreased the catalytic efficiency. A similar situation was observed when C 8 and C 14 were compared, and the presence of electron donating methyl groups at the 5,6-positions of the benzimidazole in ligand structure (C 14 ) slightly reduced the catalytic yield. The 2-naphtylmethyl, benzyl, methyl group(s) on phenyl substituent effects on the steric and electronic properties of N,N-type ligands (L 3-14 ) were assessed through experimental involving ruthenium complexes."
