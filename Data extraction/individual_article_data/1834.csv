0,Introduction,"Pressure sensors are force sensitive materials that undergo a structural change when they are subject to physical pressure. The pressure sensor can be applied to various electronic devices by converting, detecting, and quantifying the pressures into electric signals. So far, three main types of materials were used in developing pressure sensors, i.e., piezoelectric, capacitive, and piezoresistive materials [1]. Piezoresistive materials are the most promising pressure sensor due to their simple principle and manufacture, high sensitivity, and easy collection of signals. Conventional metallic and semiconductor-based piezoresistive sensors have low gauge factors, high density, and poor durability which seriously limit their applications [2]. In recent years, benefiting from the good flexibility and biocompatibility, hydrogel-based piezoresistive sensors show rocketing development for many revolutionary applications in smart control devices [3,4], healthcare monitors [5], and electronic skin systems [6,7]. Generally speaking, there are two main factors affecting the performance of a piezoresistive sensor. One is the stability of structure and conductivity. The other is the mechanical properties, including stretchability, compressibility, and durability. To improve the mechanical and conductive stability of hydrogel-based piezoresistive sensors, intense efforts have been devoted to introducing metal, semiconductor, or carbon-based nanomaterials into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), bacterial cellulose, and some other hydrogels [8–11]. All these strategies showed significant improvement of conductive stability, but they cannot help to improve mechanical performance and might even reduce the strength or toughness. Several other strategies have been developed to improve the strength or toughness of the hydrogels, including inserting polymer nanomaterials or generating interpenetrating polymer networks for fabricating nanocomposite or crosslinking hydrogels, respectively. However, the conductivity of the hydrogels could be seriously impaired by the interactional networks. More recently, more and more advanced nanomaterials, such as graphene, carbon nanotube, and three-dimensional porous materials, were developed and applied for building hydrogel sensors with outstanding performances [12]. However, most production processes are complicated, expensive, and time-consuming. Up to now, the fabrication of hydrogel-based piezoresistive sensors with good mechanical properties and stable conductivity by a simple and green approach still remains a challenge. Lignin nanoparticles (LNPs), as emerging green nanomaterials, are inviting many applications, especially in nanocomposites [13–17]. Qiu and his co-workers reported a supertough PVA/LNPs nanocomposite with high strength and ductility which attributed to the strain-induced scattering and the strong intermolecular sacrificial hydrogen bonds of LNPs in the PVA matrix [18]. However, the inherent insulativity of lignin makes it useless in electrical sensing areas. Previous studies showed that the phenolic hydroxyls or methoxy groups on the lignin can reduce silver ions (Ag+) to metallic silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs), and then converted to dynamically stable semi-quinone radicals in the presence of photogenerated electrons from Ag NPs [19]. Electors are thought to hop from radical to radical [20]. The stable radicals could contribute to a stable electron transfer. Inspired by these features of lignin, herein, we demonstrate a novel strategy to simultaneously improve the mechanical properties and conductive stability by introducing the lignin‑silver hybrid nanoparticles (Lig-Ag NPs) into the PVA matrix (PVA/Lig-Ag NPs). This nanocomposite hydrogel has excellent compressibility, good sensitivity and stability of signal response. Importantly, our strategy based on green nanomaterials is significantly advantageous in terms of fabrication complexity, costs, and lead-time."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Alkaline lignin was kindly supplied by Shan Dong Sun Paper Industry Joint Stock Co., Ltd. (Jining, China). The manufacturing process and characterizations for alkaline lignin used in this work were showed in the Supplementary information (Figs. S1, S2, Tables S1, and S2). Silver nitrate (AgNO3) and polyvinyl alcohol 124 (PVA, 98.0–99.8% hydrolyzed) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent CO., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Ammonium hydroxide (NH3·H2O) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were purchased from Jingdongtianzheng Reagent CO., Ltd. (Tianjin, China)."
3,Preparation of lignin-silver hybrid nanoparticles,"2.2 Preparation of lignin-silver hybrid nanoparticles Lignin-silver hybrid nanoparticles (Lig-Ag NPs) were fabricated by the nanoprecipitation method in an alkaline system with a reduction process [19,21]. First, alkaline lignin (0.05 g) was fully dissolved in 1.0 mL NaOH solution (0.05 g mL−1) by ultrasonic treatment for getting solution A. Solution B (silver-ammonia complex solution) was obtained by adding 2.0 mL AgNO3 solution (80 mM, 120 mM, and 160 mM Ag+) slowly to 1.0 mL NH3·H2O (0.175 g mL−1) under magnetic stirring. The reaction was carried out in a brown bottle to prevent products from light exposure. Finally, solution A was dropwise added to solution B. The mixture reacted at room temperature for 1 h under magnetic stirring (500 r min−1)."
4,Preparation of lignin-Ag NPs containing PVA hydrogel,"2.3 Preparation of lignin-Ag NPs containing PVA hydrogel The Lig-Ag NPs containing PVA hydrogel (PVA/Lig-Ag) was prepared by a simple one-pot method. A certain amount of PVA powder (7 wt%) was added in a sealed flask and mixed with deionized water, and kept vigorous stirring at 90 °C for 2 h. The transparent PVA aqueous solution was obtained. After cooling to 50 °C, the Lig-Ag NPs solution was dropwise added into PVA aqueous solution and kept stirring for 1 h (pure PVA hydrogels were prepared by adding the same volume of deionized water as Lig-Ag NPs). Then, the brown mixture was poured into molds and subjected to three freezing and thawing cycles between −18 °C (8 h) and 25 °C (2 h). For simplicity, these nanocomposite hydrogels were denoted as PVA/Lig-Ag-n, where n represented the mass fractions of Ag+ (20, 30, and 40 mM) in the corresponding hydrogels. The PVA/Lig-Ag-R-N was prepared by using the prepared Lig-Ag NPs solution after removing NH3, with the rest of the method remaining the same. In this work, none chemical crosslinker was used to fabricate the hydrogel."
5,Rheological and mechanical properties,"2.4 Rheological and mechanical properties The rheological behavior of hydrogels was studied using a dynamic rheometer (MARS 60, HAAKE) equipped with a parallel plate with a diameter of 20 mm. The working gap was set to 1 mm and the test temperature was 25 °C. Oscillatory frequency sweep measurements were performed with shear frequency in the range of 0.1–10 Hz at a strain of 1% to determine the storage (G′) and loss modulus (G″) of the hydrogels. The alternate step strain test was conducted with strain steps shifting between low strain (1%, 120 s) and high strain (100%, 60 s) at an oscillating angular frequency of 1 Hz. Viscosity versus shear-rate curves were performed for samples in the shear rate range of 0.01 to 50 s−1. Mechanical properties were tested by a universal mechanical testing machine (HF-9002 mechanical tester, Li Gao). Hydrogel samples for tensile tests were made into dumbbell-shaped bars 2 mm thick and 7.5 mm long (test area was 25 mm long and 4.4 mm wide), uniaxially tested at 30 mm min−1 of stretching rate. Toughness and Young's modulus were obtained by integrating the area of the stress−strain curve and calculating from the slope of the stress–strain curve respectively. For compression-relaxation cycle tests, cylinder-shaped hydrogels with a height of 10 mm and a diameter of 22 mm were tested at 20 mm min−1. To stabilize the cylindrical hydrogel samples, a preload of 0.1 N was applied to them. The dissipated energy of nanocomposite hydrogel was estimated by the area below the stress-strain curves [22]. At least six duplicates were measured for each sample."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization 2.5.1 Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) The Lig-Ag NPs samples were prepared by dropping the diluted and dispersed solution onto glass coverslips at room temperature. After air-dried, the samples were then coated with platinum prior to SEM analysis (JSM-IT300LV, JEOM) and FE-SEM (FEI Apreo, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at accelerating voltage of 10.0 kV and 30.0 kV respectively. For the hydrogels, the hydrated samples were freeze dried (ALPHA 1-2LD plus freeze-dryer, Christ) and then coated with platinum on the cross-section for SEM and FE-SEM analysis. 2.5.2 Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis The particle size was detected by DLS analysis (Malvern Nano-ZS Zeta Sizer, Malvern Instruments). Lig-Ag NPs solution was diluted with deionized water and ultrasonically dispersed for 1 min before the test. 2.5.3 Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy The ground samples were incorporated into KBr (250) and pressed into a 3 mm pellet with the use of a Qwik Handi-Press. The infrared spectrum from 4000 to 400 cm−1 was obtained on an FT-IR spectroscopy (FT-IR-650, Guangdong Technology) operating at a nominal resolution of 4 cm−1. The spectrometer was equipped with a globar source and a liquid nitrogen cooled Hg/Cd/Te (MCT-A) detector. A total of 32 interferograms were collected, phase-corrected, and apodized by the Happ-Genzel function prior to Fourier transformation. Duplicate experiments were performed. Second-derivative spectra were obtained with the use of the Nicolet software DR2. 2.5.4 Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy Lignin and Lig-Ag NPs suspension were diluted before recording over the wavelength range from 200 to 800 nm using a UV–vis spectrometer (UV-2550, SHIMADZU). The NaOH solution was used as a blank. 2.5.5 Cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis The CV was conducted using an Electrochemical Workstation (Zennium-E, ZAHNER). Lignin was coated on nickel foam and used as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl and Pt as the reference electrode and the counter electrode respectively. Silver-ammonia complex solution with different concentrations was used as the electrolyte, and NH3·H2O solution was used as the control electrolyte. The potential range was set from −0.20 to 0.80 V versus Ag/AgCl. Scanning three times with the rate of 5 mV·s−1, select the second cycle as result. 2.5.6 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) The pretreatment method of lignin and Lig-Ag NPs was the same as FT-IR, hydrogel samples were also tested after freeze-drying. XPS spectra of the samples were obtained with a photoelectron spectrometer (EscaLab Xi+, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using non-monochromatized Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV). The radiation source operated at 14.4 kV and 13.6 mA. The vacuum pressure was always kept around 8 × 10−10 Pa. The binding energy scale was corrected by referring to the C1s spectrum as being 284.80 eV."
7,Pressure response,"2.6 Pressure response A universal testing machine was connected with a digital multimeter (DM3068, Rigol Co., Ltd) to perform tensile and compression-strain sensing experiments of hydrogels. The tensile-strain sensing experiments were conducted by connecting the two sides of dumbbell-shaped hydrogels with copper wires. For the compression-strain sensing experiments, cylinder-shaped hydrogels (10 mm high, the diameter of 22 mm) were put on the copper tapes which connected with wires. All the real-time resistance upon deformation was recorded by the digital multimeter, and the relative resistance change was calculated by the formula: ΔR/R 0 = (R i − R 0) / R 0, where R 0 and R i were the resistance without and with applied strain, respectively [23]."
8,Result and discussion,
9,Fabrication of Lig-Ag NPs,"3.1 Fabrication of Lig-Ag NPs The facile and environmental-friendly preparation process of the hydrogel can be divided into two parts (Fig. 1 ). First, the spherical Lig-Ag NPs was prepared based on a redox reaction between lignin extracted from papermaking wastewater and the freshly prepared [Ag(NH3)2]+ complex. Second, the PVA solution was thoroughly mixed with Lig-Ag NPs to form a physical crosslinked PVA/Lig-Ag nanocomposite hydrogel, along with the color of suspension change from water clear to dark brown. The SEM and DLS results demonstrated that the Lig-Ag NPs have about 500 nm sizes and regular spherical structures (Fig. 2a–c). As depicted in Fig. 2d–f, plenty of silver nanoparticles were embedded and dispersed in bulk of lignin particles. The nature of the redox reaction in the synthesis of nanoparticles was methoxy (-OCH3) and phenolic hydroxyl (-OH) groups of lignin were oxidized into quinone/semiquinone free radicals while silver ions (Ag+) were reduced to silver nanoparticles [19], which can be further proved by the analysis of FT-IR, UV–vis, CV, and XPS. FT-IR results are showed in Figs. 3a and S3. The characteristic peaks at ~1608, ~1272, and 1033 cm−1 correspond to the aromatic ring bands, the phenolic hydroxyl (−OH) groups, and methoxy groups of lignin. All these peaks decreased in intensity in the spectrum of Lig-Ag NPs, indicating that the methoxy groups in lignin were removed during the oxidation process of lignin by the silver ions (Ag+). In the UV spectra, the enhancement of the quadrupole plasmon resonance was located in the region of 400 nm to 500 nm because the presence of Ag in the Lig-Ag NPs, revealed the surface plasmon resonance of the hybrid nanoparticles [19,24]. CV analysis was also performed to demonstrate the redox reaction between [Ag(NH3)2]+ and lignin (Fig. 3). Under the scanning rate of 5 mV·s−1, redox couple peaks clearly illustrated in the curves of [Ag(NH3)2]+ electrolyte but did not in that of NH3·H2O. The intensity of redox peaks enhanced with the increase of the concentration of [Ag(NH3)2]+. The further insight of the redox reaction was offered by XPS results. As shown in Fig. 4 , the Ag 3d band was analyzed in the narrowed range of binding energy to study the valent state of silver in the hybrid nanoparticles, peaks of Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 were apparent at 367.9 and 373.9 eV, respectively. According to the XPS database, those peaks were both ascribed to silver oxide (Ag2O) that were shifted downwards compared with bulk Ag0 (368.3 and 374.3 eV), indicating the changes of the chemical environment around Ag atoms. This phenomenon could be due to the capping lignin which electrostatically grafted to positively charge silver nano-clusters through ionogenic groups [21]. The C1s spectra indicated the lower contents of CO and C-OH (286.1 eV) in Lig-Ag NPs and a higher content of CO (288.3 eV) than that in original lignin, which further demonstrated lignin was oxidized by [Ag(NH3)2]+. The O1s spectra revealed that the content of CO (532.3 eV) and -COO (533.3 eV) in Lig-Ag NPs were sharply decreased and the content of CO groups greatly increased. Besides, the peaks of Ag-OH (536 eV) and Ag-O-Ag (531.5 eV) could ascribe to the hydrogen-bonding interaction between the Ag NPs and lignin in the hybrid nanoparticles."
10,PVA/Lig-Ag hydrogel,"3.2 PVA/Lig-Ag hydrogel The micromorphology and chemical structure of PVA/Lig-Ag composite hydrogel were detected by FE-SEM element mapping, XPS, and FT-IR analysis, respectively. During the freezing/thawing treatment, physical crosslinking was formed between the PVA and Lig-Ag NPs (Figs. 4 and S3) [25]. The micromorphologies of the fractured cross-sections of pure PVA and PVA/Lig-Ag hydrogels were observed by SEM. Fig. 5 indicated that the introduction of Lig-Ag NPs and more hydrogen-bonding endowed the hydrogel with a denser and more uniform porous structure. In addition, the disappeared peak of -COO in the XPS spectrum of the PVA/Lig-Ag hydrogel was also ascribed to the hydrogen-bonding interaction between lignin and PVA chains. It was worth noting that the direct composited PVA/Lig-Ag hydrogel has a denser porous structure, which could be caused by the escapement of “NH3 bubbles” from excessive NH3·H2O in the solution. Before preparing Lig-Ag NPs, excessive NH3·H2O was added to obtain [Ag(NH3)2]+ complex, which induced viscous PVA solution to continuously generate a mass of NH3 bubbles. These bubbles could be withheld in the nanocomposite hydrogels after freezing treatment. To explore the influence of NH3, the micromorphologies of PVA/Lig-Ag and PVA/Lig-Ag-R-N (removing NH3) hydrogels were also compared. Fig. 5d and f showed that the pores of PVA/Lig-Ag have smaller and more uniform pores structure (Fig. 5d and f) and larger surface area (14.2 m2 g−1) than PVA/Lig-Ag RN hydrogel (1.3 m2 g−1). Possessing a uniform porous network structure will be beneficial to high mechanical strength and free transport of electrolyte ion within the hydrogel [26]."
11,Mechanical properties,"3.3 Mechanical properties The mechanical properties of PVA, PVA/Lig-Ag, and PVA/Lig-Ag-R-N hydrogel were evaluated by conducting tensile and compressive tests (Fig. 6 ). Compared with pure PVA, PVA/Lig-Ag hydrogel exhibited much higher tensile strength, elongation at break, toughness, and Young's modulus. In all the samples, PVA/Lig-Ag-20 hydrogel shows the best stretchability (315% elongation at break). The tensile strength and Young's modulus were significantly improved to 0.79 MPa and 2.26 kPa, which were 8 times and 6 times increase compared with the original PVA, respectively (Fig. 6c). Meanwhile, the tensile toughness of PVA/Lig-Ag-20 hydrogel reached a high value of 1.04 MJ m−3, which was about 10 times higher than the original PVA (0.11 MJ m−3). However, after removing NH3, the elongation at break, toughness, and Young's modulus of PVA/Lig-Ag-R-N hydrogel was significantly lower than PVA/Lig-Ag hydrogel. The strong and tough mechanical performance of PVA/Lig-Ag-20 was attributed to the uniform porous network structure. Specifically, hydrogen bond interaction and the porogenic effect of NH3 bubbles were responsible for the porous structure and uniform dispersion of nanoparticles. Moreover, the nanophase separation and strong intermolecular sacrificial bonds between Lig-Ag NPs and PVA (including hydrogen bonds and silver ionic interactions) in the inner hydrogel structure also contributed the enhancement in the extensibility and toughness of hydrogel [27]. In order to explore the self-recovery capacity and fatigue resistance, series compression tests of PVA/Lig-Ag-20 hydrogel at different compression strains were conducted. Fig. 6d shows that the PVA/Lig-Ag hydrogel was quickly recovered to its original state without any rupture after compression. As shown in the multi-strain compression curves (Fig. 6e and f), the compression strength was remarkably improved by adding the hybrid nanoparticles. The compression stress at the strain of 60% reached as high as 210.75 kPa, which was nearly 6 times the original PVA (37.79 kPa). Another evidence of self-recovery was shown by the dissipate energy that was obtained from the compression stress-strain curve. Under different strains, the hysteresis loop area (presents the dissipate energy) of PVA/Lig-Ag hydrogel was always much larger compared to the original PVA, indicating the better energy dissipation capacity of PVA/Lig-Ag hydrogel. Besides, the areas of the hysteresis loop were positively correlated with the compression strain. This might be due to more dynamic cross-links were destroyed to consume energy as the strain increased, leading to larger hysteresis loops of the nanocomposite hydrogel [28]. The fatigue resistance and self-recovery capacity of PVA/Lig-Ag hydrogel was also tested by a successive compressive loading-unloading experiment at a 40% strain of PVA/Lig-Ag-20 hydrogel for 100 cycles without resting intervals (Fig. 6f). The value of corresponding stress at a specific strain is consistent with that in the multi-strain compression test. No evident decrease of stress was observed in the 100 cycles, which can certify the excellent recovery property and fatigue resistance of PVA/Lig-Ag hydrogel. The improved mechanical performance was explained by the formation of a much denser physical crosslinking network that can effectively dissipate energy under deformation."
12,Rheological behavior,"3.4 Rheological behavior The structural features and mechanical properties of the hydrogels were further revealed by the dynamic frequency sweep rheological measurements from 0.01 to 10 Hz (Fig. 7a). It is clear that both of the storage and loss modulus (G′ and G″) of the nanocomposite hydrogel increased nearly 10-fold compared to the original PVA, which attributed to the stronger interaction between PVA chains and hybrid nanoparticles. In the front region of the low frequency of nanocomposite hydrogel, the value of G′ was lower than that of the counterpart G″, and both of them were regional monotonic increased as frequency increased. These results correspond to show the liquid-like feature of nanocomposite hydrogel. When the increase of the frequency, the value of G″ continued to reach its maximum value and then declined gradually, while G′ increased and exceeded G″ to arrive at a high-frequency plateau value, illustrating the dynamic nature of the hydrogen bonds in the gel network [29,30]. These results suggested a more stable, elastic, and tougher hydrogel network was constructed through incorporating Lig-Ag NPs [31]. The results of viscosity measurement were shown in Fig. 7b. With increasing shear rate, the viscosities of all the hydrogel samples decreased, which illustrate the shear thinning behavior of the hydrogels. In comparison with the pristine PVA hydrogel, the shearing thinning phenomenon of PVA/Lig-Ag hydrogels was more significant, and the viscosity values of them were much higher. These results could be due to the disruption of physical cross-links and broken segments under higher mobility, and also demonstrated the special contribution of Lig-Ag NPs to the self-recovery of the PVA [32]. Furthermore, the alternate step strain test was carried out to assess the dynamic reversible behavior of PVA/Lig-Ag hydrogel (Fig. 7c). The continuous shear strain was alternated between 1% (60 s) and 100% (120 s), respectively. When the gel was subjected to a smaller shear strain, G′ was higher than G″, and both moduli remained almost constant with time, presenting the stable elastic hydrogel was formed [33]. In contrast, at the higher strain amplitudes of 100%, G″ was greater than G′ accompanying a violently decrease of G′, which might be induced by the collapse of the hydrogel. Subsequently, when cycled low strain (1%) was applied, G′ and G″ were fully restored to original values. This consequence also certified the self-recovery ability of the hybrid nanoparticles containing hydrogel [34]."
13,Pressure sensitivity,"3.5 Pressure sensitivity To explore the conductivity sensitivity of the samples, a set of devices were assembled as exhibited in Fig. 8a. The conductivity sensitivity was quantified by relative resistance variation (ΔR/R 0) which was calculated with the original resistance (R 0) and the resistance variation at a certain strain (ΔR = Ri − R 0) [34]. The tensile-strain sensing performance of PVA/Lig-Ag-20 was also performed and the result was shown in Fig. S6. It is considered that the stress sensitivity of this kind of hydrogel is inferior compared with pressure sensitivity. To investigate the sensing stability, a cycled loading test was conducted at 20% and 40% strain. Remarkably, the relative resistance variation could be restored to its initial value after unloading every time, identifying the outstanding sensing stability. The amplitude of curve was raised with the strain increased from 20% to 40%, proving that the electrical signal is likely respond to different strains within a certain range. Fig. 8d, e, and Table S3 display the pressure sensitivity of all hydrogel samples, the absolute values of ΔR/R 0 were gradually enhanced under increasing pressures. The curves can be divided into three steps according to slopes (S, S′, and S″) that represent the sensitivities of the samples. The PVA/Lig-Ag-20 has the highest sensitive performance (S = 2.630 kPa−1), which not only increased 2.8-fold comparing to the original PVA (S = 0.934 kPa−1), but also is a superior result to previous reported pressure sensors (Fig. 8f). There are two ways of explaining about these results. First, the internal honeycomb structure of nanocomposite gel was squeezed caused a change in the resistance. In detail, this is mainly owing to the decreasing distance between the conductive components (such as Ag NPs) in the hydrogel which leading to more interconnections under compression force [35]. And another reason is that the reduction of distance between free radicals of lignin. Free radicals can facilitate the delivery of electronic, which is benefit to the pressure sensitivity (Fig. 8c). The sensitivity reduction is intuitively reflected by the reduction of slope (S > S′ > S″), which could be explained by the distance between conductive components or free radicals had reached the limit. Moreover, the pressure sensitivity of PVA/Lig-Ag-R-N hydrogel is apparently weaker, also demonstrating the advantage of the porogenic function of NH3."
14,Conclusions,"In summary, we provided a simple and low-cost but efficient approach to fabricate hydrogel-based piezoresistive sensor, PVA/Lig-Ag NPs, with good mechanical properties and stable conductivity. Compared with the commonly used hydrogel sensors, PVA/Lig-Ag NPs hydrogel had the following advantages. First, the direct application of industrial lignin reduced not only the cost of the hydrogel but also the waste of lignin resources. Second, lignin and Ag NPs depend on and restrict each other. The formation of Lig-Ag NPs not only decreased the release of Ag NPs but also generate dynamically stable semi-quinone radicals in lignin, which provided strong sacrificial hydrogen bonds and facilitated the delivery of electronic in PVA matrix. Moreover, during the composite process, the escaped ammonia from Lig-Ag NPs solution endowed the hydrogel with denser and more uniform porous structure. Overall, this green and easy-to-prepare nanocomposite hydrogel would open a new idea for the development of piezoresistive pressure sensors."
