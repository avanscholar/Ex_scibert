0,Introduction,"Hydrogen obtained from renewable sources such as sunlight and water will be the clean fuel of choice either when fossil fuel supplies become depleted or when the environmental consequences of burning fossil fuels are no longer acceptable. Of the many approaches to generating hydrogen from renewable sources, the direct photoelectrolysis of water using solar energy is the ideal method for producing hydrogen [1,2]. Unfortunately the transparency of water to solar radiation necessitates the use of a semiconductor photocatalyst to mediate initial light absorption and carrier generation. While much progress has been made [1–3] since the pioneering experiments [4,5] on titanium dioxide ( TiO 2 ) some 30 years ago, efficient and cost-effective solar photoelectrolysis of water still remains an elusive goal. Instead of attempting to split water, an attractive approach would be to use a p-type semiconductor cathode to generate electrons at the semiconductor/electrolyte interphase and to drive the “dark” oxidation of a sacrificial agent in the other cell compartment. This approach (see the scheme in Fig. 1 ) has several advantages compared to the conventional water photosplitting strategy: (a) the photogenerated electrons can be used to generate hydrogen from water; (b) the four electron oxidation of water is both kinetically and energetically daunting (e.g., Refs. [6,7]); (c) many semiconductors are more stable in a cathodic than in an anodic photocurrent flow environment [8,9]; and (d) value can be added to the hydrogen generation process by choosing an environmental pollutant as the “sacrificial” reducing agent in the counterelectrode compartment [10–13]. Oxide semiconductors are eminently attractive candidates as photocatalyst both from inherent cost and photochemical stability considerations. The component elements of many oxides also occur widely in nature and are environmentally benign. The prototype oxide semiconductor for photoelectrochemical applications is TiO 2 ; however, it has too large an energy band gap, E g (3.0–3.2eV) for efficiently harnessing solar energy. Copper(I) oxide (Cu 2 O) is an attractive oxide semiconductor in this regard. It has a band gap energy of 2.0–2.2eV and a high absorption coefficient over the wavelength range in the solar spectrum. Its component elements are non-toxic and are highly abundant. It has also been used as a photocatalyst for solar water splitting and H 2 generation [14–16] and for forming junctions of p - Cu 2 O with other oxide semiconductors such as n- TiO 2 [17,18] and n-type ZnO [19,20] for various applications. The report [15] of photocatalytic water splitting on Cu 2 O powder suspensions (with claimed stability in excess of ∼ 1900 h ) has been greeted with skepticism by others [16] who have also pointed out that the Cu 2 O band-edges are unlikely to bracket the H + / H 2 and O 2 / H 2 O redox levels as required. In view of the above, it was of interest to use the approach schematized in Fig. 1 to see whether the photoassisted generation of hydrogen could be driven using p - Cu 2 O . To our knowledge, thin films of this material have not been examined in this regard. Electrodeposited films of Cu 2 O were used in this study; the advantages of this low temperature preparative route for the cost- and energy-efficient synthesis of semiconductors have been well documented [21–23]. In what follows, experiments designed to demonstrate proof-of-concept of the approach schematized in Fig. 1 are described."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemicals and materials,"2.1 Chemicals and materials Copper sulfate (Alfa Aesar, 99%), sodium lactate aqueous solution (Alfa Aesar, 60% w/w), nickel sulfate (Alfa Aesar, 98%), and methyl viologen (Aldrich, 98%) were used as received. All other chemicals were from commercial sources and were of the highest purity available. They were used without further purification. The transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrates consisted of F-doped tin oxide (Nippon Sheet Glass Ltd.) coated on soda-lime glass. They were nominally ca. 400nm thick and had a sheet resistance of 10.3 Ω / □ . Strips ( 0.65 cm × 2 cm ) were cut and cleaned in four 5min steps of cleansing in ultrasonicated acetone, ethanol, 1:1 H 2 O 2 /ammonia, and finally ultrapure water. All solutions in this study were prepared from double-distilled (Corning Megapure) water."
3,Instrumentation and procedure,"2.2 Instrumentation and procedure The p - Cu 2 O film was cathodically electrodeposited from 0.4M cupric sulfate bath containing 3M sodium lactate [24]. The bath pH was carefully adjusted to 9 by controlled addition of 4M NaOH. Films were grown at - 0.40 V (vs. Ag | AgCl | satd . KCl reference (all potentials in this study are quoted with respect to this reference electrode until otherwise mentioned) for a nominal duration of 30min. A standard single-compartment, three-electrode electrochemical cell was used for film preparation. A Cu mesh and an Ag | AgCl | satd . KCl reference electrode (Microelectrode Inc.), along with the TCO substrate as the working electrode, completed the cell set-up. Electrodeposition and cyclic voltammetic studies were carried out on a 100A Electrochemical Analyzer [Bioanalytical Systems (BAS), W. Lafayette, IN]. The deposition bath temperature was controlled at 60°C. The photodeposition of Ni on p - Cu 2 O surface was carried out by irradiating the TCO / Cu 2 O photoelectrode with visible light, in a solution containing 0.01 M NiSO 4 and 5% isopropyl alcohol (as hole scavenger) for 1h. Colloidal particles of Cu 2 O were synthesized according to a reported procedure [25]. A two-compartment, two-electrode electrochemical cell was used to measure the photocurrent. Electrolyte solution (0.5M Na 2 SO 4 ) in the anode compartment contained either the electrolyte at a basic pH 10 or the electrolyte plus one of the following sacrificial electron donors (0.05M): ( K 4 [ Ru ( CN ) 6 ] , formate, K 4 [ Fe ( CN ) 6 ] , hydroquinone ( pH 6 ) , hydroquinone ( pH 10 ) , triethylamine. Cyclic voltammetry was used in the selection of the optimal (sacrificial) electron donor (see below). A three-electrode cell configuration was used for cyclic voltammetry with a reference electrode of Ag | AgCl | satd . KCl. The cathode compartment (Fig. 1) contained either the electrolyte alone (0.5M Na 2 SO 4 ) or the electrolyte containing 40mM methyl viologen as electron acceptor. A 100W tungsten-halogen lamp (Oriel, Stratford, CT) was used as the visible light source for the photodeposition of Ni, for the photocurrent measurements and for photoaction spectroscopy. The incident photon flux (as measured with an Oriel Model 70260 radiant power/energy meter) was 0.95 mW / cm 2 . X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) used a Perkin Elmer/Physical Electronics Model 5000C instrument with other details given elsewhere [26]. For scanning electron microscopy (SEM), a Zeiss Supra 55 instrument with a nominal electron beam voltage of 5kV was used. UV–Vis spectrophotometry employed a Hewlett–Packard model HP 8452 diode array spectrometer. The short-circuit photocurrent measurements and photoaction spectroscopy employed a model CV-27 BAS voltammograph equipped with a model VP-6414S Soltec X–Y recorder. The monochromator used was a Thermo Jarrel Ash corporation Model 82-415 with a grating blazed at 600nm. The nominal Cu 2 O film thickness (as measured by SEM cross-section analysis) was 1.5 ± 0.1 μ m . All measurements below pertain to the laboratory ambient temperature (approximately 25°C)."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Surface modification of p - Cu 2 O,"3.1 Surface modification of p - Cu 2 O Other than driving the photooxidation of water or photoreduction of protons to H 2 , the photogenerated carriers on a semiconductor surface can also be used to chemically modify it [8]. For example, irradiation of the TCO / Cu 2 O photoelectrode with visible light in a 0.01M NiSO 4 solution also containing 5% isopropyl alcohol at open circuit (see Experimental section) results in photodeposition of Ni on the p - Cu 2 O surface. As Fig. 2 illustrates, the Ni 2 + / 0 redox level is optimally located with respect to the p - Cu 2 O conduction band edge such that the Ni 2 + species can be spontaneously (i.e., photocatalytically) reduced to metallic nickel. The photogenerated holes in p - Cu 2 O (majority carriers) diffuse to the surface where they oxidize isopropyl alcohol (presumably to CO 2 and H 2 O ). Fig. 2 also depicts the energy diagram pertinent to this interfacial reaction situation. It must be borne in mind that while the NiSO 4 solution is colored, its absorption spectrum does not overlap with the optical bandedge of the Cu 2 O such that no “inner filter” optical interference is present here (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 4 contains the SEM top (Fig. 4a) and cross-sectional (Fig. 4b) views of the TCO / Cu 2 O / Ni architecture. The grain morphology of p - Cu 2 O seen in Fig. 4a has been discussed elsewhere [27]. In Fig. 4b the ultra-thin Ni layer seen to the left of the Cu 2 O film in the micrograph is worth noting. Clearly its presence does not interfere with the ability of SEM to discern the much larger grain structure/morphology of the Cu 2 O layer. The thickness of the Ni layer can be optimized by adjusting the irradiation time; 1h irradiation yielded the best results. The photogenerated electrons in p - Cu 2 O are energetically capable of reducing the oxide to the metal, Fig. 2. However, XPS measurements on a Cu 2 O sample after prolonged use in a photoelectrochemical cell (under conditions described below) did not show any spectral changes in the Cu 2p binding energy region. Thus, an as-prepared Cu 2 O film shows a Cu 2 p 3 / 2 peak at 932.1eV and an O 1s binding energy at 529.5eV. These values are in reasonable agreement with reference data [28]. The XPS data also show the evidence of a carbon overlayer originating from adsorbed lactate species from the deposition bath. Details associated with this overlayer have been recently discussed in a companion paper [29]."
6,Screening of electron donors,"3.2 Screening of electron donors Cyclic voltammetry was used to screen candidates for the (sacrificial) electron donor in the counterelectrode compartment (see Fig. 1). Fig. 5 shows data for five such candidates with hydroquinone shown at two different solution pH values. An important parameter here is the oxidation potential ( E ox ) which can be extracted from the oxidation waves peak potentials in the voltammetry data. These values are also shown in each of the frames in Fig. 5. The more negative the value of E ox , the more the reducing power of the electron donor compound. Triethylamine and hydroquinone at pH 10 emerge as the best candidates in this regard. Fig. 6 maps how these oxidation potentials lie relative to the p - Cu 2 O band edges in the 0.5M Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte. Clearly, the photogenerated holes in Cu 2 O will not have sufficient energy to oxidize the Ru metal center in the cyanide complex from the + 2 to the + 3 state. A second important factor in the choice of the reducing agent (electron donor) is electron transfer kinetics. A versatile gauge of this property of a given redox system is afforded by cyclic voltammetry [30]. For example, the charge transfer kinetics in the hydroquinone redox system are much more facile at pH 10 than at pH 6; the voltammetry waves are sharper (less drawn out) and the peak separation for the anodic and cathode waves is much smaller (Fig. 5). On the other hand, compare hydroquinone at pH 10 with triethylamine. The oxidation kinetics are much faster in the former; the oxidation of triethylamine is also chemically irreversible as diagnosed by the absence of a cathodic wave on the return (negative-going) scan in the voltammogram (lower, right-hand corner, Fig. 5). These trends will manifest in the photocurrent data to be discussed next."
7,Spontaneous (zero bias) photocurrents,"3.3 Spontaneous (zero bias) photocurrents With the TCO / p - Cu 2 O photoelectrode (with or without nickel modification) in the cathode compartment connected to the Pt coil in the anode chamber (short-circuited), visible light irradiation of it should result in spontaneous photocurrent flow at zero bias voltage. Under these conditions, photoexcitation of Cu 2 O results in e - – h + pair generation. The electrons move to the solution, the holes to the back contact and thence to the counterelectrode where they are available for oxidation of the electron donor species (e.g., hydroquinone) in the anolyte. Short-circuit chronoamperometric profiles recorded under these conditions show sharp spike in cathodic photocurrent that exponentially decays to a steady-state regime as shown in the case of MV 2 + / HQ (pH10) (Fig. 7 insert). The exponential decay is associated with e - – h + recombination whereas the steady-state photocurrent indicates electron flow from the photoelectrode to the electron acceptor. The steady-state photocurrents measured in this manner are shown in Fig. 7; they are expressed as photocurrent density values ( μ A / cm 2 ) taking into account the irradiated area (geometric) of the p - Cu 2 O film surface. Consider the top four cases first. Most importantly, the “control” case involving no added electron donor in the counterelectrode (anode) compartment yields negligible photocurrents signaling that the splitting of water to H 2 and O 2 occurs to an insignificant extent in this system. This (crucial) finding contradicts the results from a prior study [15] and supports another group questioning the validity of these claims [16]. Clearly, the photogenerated holes in Cu 2 O do not have sufficient energy to oxidize H 2 O (to O 2 ) (Fig. 2) contrasting the trend with TiO 2 . Note that the valence band edge of TiO 2 lies at a potential much more positive than in the case of Cu 2 O (Fig. 2). Secondly, mirroring the cyclic voltammetry data trends, the photocurrents were negligible for hydroquinone at pH6 (not shown) but significant for the same electron donor at pH10. The photocurrents are marginally better for hydroquinone than for triethylamine, presumably because of reasons related to electron transfer kinetics differences in the two cases (c.f., Fig. 5). Thirdly, in every case, the photocurrents are higher when the Ni overlayer is present on the p - Cu 2 O surface (Fig. 7). This underlines the catalytic role exerted by this metal. Catalytic effects in the photoelectrochemical behavior of semiconductor surfaces modified with metals are well documented [2,3,8,9]. When an electron mediator (or relay) species such as the methyl viologen cation [31] is present in the cathode chamber, even higher photocurrents are seen (Fig. 7, bottom). Clearly, these species are effective in capturing the photogenerated electrons from TCO / p - Cu 2 O before they undergo recombination. Spectral evidence for the consequent generation of the radical cation ( MV · + ) species is furnished by data obtained in situ by placing the cell directly in the light path of a diode array spectrometer [32]. Representative data are contained in Fig. 8 . Clearly, mass transfer of MV 2 + species in the catholyte plays a crucial role in the magnitude of the photocurrents observed (Fig. 9 ). The photocurrent decay seen a few seconds after the lamp is turned on (Fig. 9a), stems from the depletion of the MV 2 + species near the photocathode surface. This initial current level is immediately restored when the catholyte is stirred. The photocurrent density could be boosted to ∼ 0.5 mA / cm 2 (ca. four times the highest levels seen in Fig. 7) by vigorous stirring of the catholyte (Fig. 9b)."
8,Photoelectrochemical behavior,"3.4 Photoelectrochemical behavior Fig. 10 contains a photoaction spectrum at - 0.3 V bias and a representative linear sweep photovoltammogram for an electrodeposited Cu 2 O film under chopped illumination (Fig. 10 insert) in a medium in 0.5M Na 2 SO 4 containing 40mM MV 2 + . The onset of cathodic photocurrents around ∼ 0.15 V is consistent with p-type semiconductor behavior. The photocurrent markedly increases with the negative bias potential and reaches a pseudo-stationary steady state in the negative potential range of - 0.3 to - 0.5 V . After this level, a small dark current background indicates the reduction of Cu 2 O to elemental Cu. That the measured photocurrents arise from excitation of p - Cu 2 O is shown by the photoaction spectrum contained in Fig. 10. The very gradual rise of the photocurrents near the band edge, however, is diagnostic of facile recombination at the photocathode surface of the photogenerated carriers."
9,Conclusions,"A p-type semiconductor such as p - Cu 2 O was combined with the oxidation of a sacrificial electron donor for photocatalytically generating H 2 in a twin-compartment electrochemical cell. Spontaneous photocurrents were observed at zero bias voltage when hydroquinone was used as the electron donor in the anode chamber. The measured photocurrent, however, must be boosted at least by an order of magnitude before this approach can be considered for practical use. While proof-of-concept was completed in this study, one major hurdle with Cu 2 O is the location of its valence band edge. Specifically, its location at relatively negative potentials (relative to other semiconductors such as TiO 2 or WO 3 , for example) means that the holes are not very energetic. For improving the process economics and to add value to the proposed hydrogen generation approach, an environmental pollutant such as a dye, cyanide, sulfite, etc., can be used as the electron donor in the anode chamber. However, these candidates would require the use of an oxide semiconductor with a lower-lying valence band but yet an acceptably small energy band gap in the 2.0–2.2eV range. Work in this direction is on going in our laboratory."
