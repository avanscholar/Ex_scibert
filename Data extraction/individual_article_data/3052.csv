0,Introduction,"The ‘carboxylate platform’ concept has been introduced by Holtzapple et al. (1999) to generate energy intense chemicals, specifically carboxylic acids, in single stage bioconversion processes by using undefined mixed cultures. Since then, a variety of chemical and biological conversions in which carboxylates can be used as building block has been shown by different researchers. The principle of the platform is a partial anaerobic digestion of organic matters using mixed cultures in which mainly acetate (C2), propionate (C3) and n-butyrate (C4) in the aqueous phase and hydrogen in the gas phase are produced. It is, however, important to selectively produce one end compound or a favorable ratio of a carboxylates mixture in the first stage, since this will be the precursor for the generation of the target compounds in the second stage (Li and Yu, 2011). For example, in the polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production, the type of carboxylates and mixture composition produced in the carboxylate platform determines the type of PHA produced (Serafim et al., 2008). Organic waste streams are attractive candidates to use as a substrate for generation of biobased chemicals. The main advantage of using waste streams is that they are cheap materials (sometimes with no cost or with a gate fee). Anyhow, large amounts of organic waste are being generated and need to be treated. Fortunately, fermentation of organic waste materials provides both treatment of waste matters and simultaneous generation of carboxylates like acetate, propionate and n-butyrate (Gajdos, 1998). Organic waste materials are mainly composed of carbohydrate, protein and lipid type polymers. Given this complex composition of the starting material, a mixed consortium is required to reduce each polymer to valuable end products (Angenent and Wrenn, 2008). Further, using mixed cultures makes the fermentation process economically more interesting because of elimination of a costly sterilization process. The overall process becomes more stable and flexible without the risk of contamination (Ueno et al., 1995). However, using mixed consortia degrading a complex substrate leads to an effluent containing a mixture of various acids and alcohols in different concentrations. As a result downstream processing is more challenging which increases the production costs of the target products. It is thus crucial to maximize both the concentration and the fraction of a single compound in total products. When more than one product is required the fermentation process needs to be steered towards a certain ratio of desired compounds. Increasing concentrations and tuning the product distribution among fermentation products can be achieved in several ways. In literature, substrate type, concentration of substrate in the fermenter, retention time, reactor design, temperature, and pH were found to alter the concentrations and also the type of products. Table 1 presents reported product concentrations and distributions from different studies in literature. In our previous work, it was shown that headspace manipulation with externally added hydrogen and/or carbon dioxide in variable ratios can increase product concentrations and result in the selective production of a single compound depending on the polymer type in mixed culture fermentation (Arslan et al., 2012). Previously, the effect of feed concentration in batch and continuous mode operation on fermentation products was investigated by Lim et al. (2008), Gomez et al. (2009), Coats et al. (2011) and Badiei et al. (2011) (Table 1). These studies aimed to maximize the total concentration of carboxylates rather than targeting selective generation of a single compound. Yet, in their results it was shown that carboxylate concentrations and distributions were affected by changing the substrate concentration in the fermenter. The aim of this work was to investigate the combined effect on the carboxylate product spectrum by applying only hydrogen or only carbon dioxide at 2bar to the headspace at increasing substrate concentrations."
1,Methods,
2,Inocula and waste streams,"2.1 Inocula and waste streams As inoculum, granular sludge from a potato wastewater anaerobic digester (Opure, Ede, The Netherlands) was used. To avoid methanogenic growth during fermentation, the granules were first washed with 20mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 5 and sieved through 500μm for three times. They were left in potassium phosphate buffer solution overnight at room temperature. The next day, the granules were heat-treated by boiling in water for 15min. Carbohydrate rich waste streams were collected from a potato processing company."
3,Batch experiments,"2.2 Batch experiments Batch reactors (5L) with 750ml working volume were run as described in Arslan et al. (2012). The organic waste stream was diluted to three different initial substrate concentrations: 8, 13.5 and 23g Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD substrate/L) through the addition of basal medium solution. The basal medium was prepared according to Phillips et al. (1993). To avoid sulfate reduction during fermentation, sulfate salts were omitted. The reactors were inoculated with 8g of wet weight (0.6g Volatile Solids (VS) content) of pre-treated granular sludge. Pressures in the reactors were increased to 2bar by applying only hydrogen or only carbon dioxide. With a manometer, the headspace pressure of each reactor was monitored on-line. If the headspace pressure dropped during the experiment, it was adjusted back to 2bar with the same original headspace gases. A control reactor was prepared in the same way. However, it was flushed with N2 only at the beginning of the experiment and connected to a volumetric gas counter (Milligascounter, BnC-Ritter) working under atmospheric pressure. Reactors were stirred at 100rpm by a magnetic drive stirrer (Büchi-cyclone 075) and kept at 30°C with hot water circulation. The experiments lasted 30days with weekly gas and liquid sampling. The sampling amount was calculated in a way that the liquid to headspace ratio was not disturbed or no underpressure was occurring."
4,Continuous experiment,"2.3 Continuous experiment A continuous reactor (5L) with 3L working volume was prepared in the same way as the batch reactors. The initial wet weight of inocula in the continuous reactor was kept at the same concentration as in the batch experiments. The headspace was flushed with N2 at the beginning of the experiment and then connected to a volumetric gas counter under 1bar of atmospheric pressure. The reactor was kept at 30°C with hot water circulation. The reactor pH was initially not controlled. When the pH spontaneously dropped to 4, it was kept above 3.9 by dosing 2M NaOH. The hydraulic retention time (HRT) of the reactor was 2days. The substrate load to the reactor was 23gCOD/Ld. Waste was diluted with the same basal medium solution as in the batch experiments. The feed tank was kept at 4°C to avoid that fermentation already started inside the tank and was continuously stirred to prevent settling of particles. A grinder pump (Cat DK 40, drive unit X 1740) was connected in a closed loop to the influent tank and continuously circulated the influent solution to reduce the size of the particles coming from the waste material. A peristaltic pump (Watson Marlow 520 Du) was used for regular feeding from the loop to the reactor."
5,Analysis,"2.4 Analysis Gas samples were collected by using a gas-tight plastic syringe and analyzed in a gas chromatograph (Interscience, Thermo Scientific, Trace GC Ultra) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). H2 content was analyzed with a 2m stainless steel column packed with a molecular sieve 5A (80/100mesh) using nitrogen as carrier gas at a flow rate of 20ml/min. Carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen and methane gases were analyzed with a 2m stainless steel HayeSepQ (80/100mesh) and molecular sieve 5A (80/100mesh) column connected in series with a valve. Helium was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 15ml/min. Liquid samples were collected from the stirred bioreactors and influent tank and centrifuged for 5min at 10,000rpm to remove particles. Volatile fatty acid (VFA) samples were acidified with 1:1 (v/v) H2SO4 solution and then extracted with diethyl ether. VFAs were analyzed in a GC (Interscience, CE Instruments, Focus GC) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a 15m AT-1000 filled capillary column (0.53mm×1.2μm). Helium was used as carrier gas at a constant flow of 6ml/min. Acetone, ethanol and propanol were analyzed in the headspace of the samples at 60°C with the same GC fitted in split mode with a split/splitless injector and AT-WAX capillary column (60m×0.32mm×1.00μm). Helium was used as carrier gas with a flow rate of 1.6ml/min. Lactate was analyzed with a GC (Interscience, CE Instruments- Trace GC) equipped with FID detector in split mode with split/splitless injector and AT-1 capillary column (30m×0.53mm×5μm column). Samples were first treated with Ce(SO4)2 at 60°C for 10min to convert lactic acid into acetaldehyde which was then analyzed in the headspace. Waste streams were analyzed with the Phenol–sulfuric method (Dubois et al., 1956) at 485nm wavelength to determine the carbohydrate concentration. Protein content was measured with the Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen method, by multiplying NH4–N concentrations with a factor of 6.25 (Pierce and Haenisch, 1948). Total and volatile solid contents were analyzed as described in Standard Methods (APHA, 1995). Total Chemical Oxygen Demand (CODt) was determined with Dr. Hach Lange cuvette tests. Soluble COD (CODs), NH4–N and PO4–P concentrations of samples were analyzed with Dr. Hach Lange cuvette tests after filtration of the samples at 0.45μm."
6,Calculations,"2.5 Calculations Hydrolysis degree, COD recovery and fractions of products were calculated with the formulas mentioned by Arslan et al. (2012). The reaction Gibbs free energy values ( Δ G r ′ ) under the actual environmental conditions were calculated by Eq. (1). (1) Δ r ′ = ∑ Δ G f _ products ° - ∑ Δ G f _ reactants ° + R . T . ∑ i ( v i ln c i ) where v i is the stoichiometric coefficient and c i is the concentration for each reactant and product. Standard Gibbs free energy values ( Δ G f ° ) of components were taken from Amend and Shock (2001). For the calculations, it was assumed that the reactions reached thermodynamic equilibrium. Glucose, acetate, propionate and n-butyrate concentrations were set to 1M, hydrogen and carbon dioxide pressure to 1 and 5bar, pH to 5 and temperature to 30°C. The calculations were set up assuming unlimited hydrogen supply and with the substrate as sole carbon source."
7,Results and discussions,"The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of applying 2bar of 100% hydrogen and 2bar of 100% carbon dioxide in the headspace on the fermentation product spectrum at increasing substrate concentration. Firstly, thermodynamics of the fermentation reactions were determined to evaluate the impact of hydrogen and carbon dioxide on reactions from glucose to acetate, propionate and n-butyrate. Glucose was used as substrate in the reactions as it is the monomer of the starch type substrate which constituted the waste streams used in the subsequent tests. Next to the thermodynamic calculations, batch and continuous experiments were performed to evaluate fermentation product spectrum."
8,All carboxylate production reactions from glucose are thermodynamically feasible,"3.1 All carboxylate production reactions from glucose are thermodynamically feasible There are several factors that regulate fermentation reactions such as microbial consortium, kinetics and thermodynamics (Lee et al., 2008). Thermodynamic calculations were thus used to demonstrate under which headspace conditions the VFA generating reactions are feasible. The changes in Δ G r ′ values of reactions from glucose conversion to acetate, propionate and n-butyrate production were studied under 1 and 5bar hydrogen partial pressures as a function of carbon dioxide partial pressure. Fig. 1 shows that all reactions were below the threshold value of −20kJ/mol under all the selected headspace conditions. Hence, they occur spontaneously under the selected actual conditions. From a thermodynamic point of view, it can thus be anticipated that each product has a similar potential to be formed since each reaction yields approximately the same amount of energy. This also explains why in a non-sterilized environment mixtures of carboxylates will be generated in similar concentrations. In general, the effects of hydrogen and carbon dioxide partial pressures on the studied reactions were negligible. Because hydrogen and carbon dioxide are produced in reactions (R1) and (R3), increasing the hydrogen and carbon dioxide partial pressure has an adverse effect on the reactions Δ G r ′ values but they still remain in the exothermic zone, even at partial pressures up to 5bar. Among the three reactions investigated, glucose conversion to propionate (R2) was thermodynamically the most favorable reaction. Because no carbon dioxide is involved in (R2), its partial pressure evidently has no impact on the Δ G r ′ value. (R1) glucose + 2 H 2 O → 2 acetate - + 2 H + + 4 H 2 + 2 CO 2 Δ G r ° ′ = - 216 kJ / mol (R2) glucose + 2 H 2 → 2 propionate - + 2 H + + 2 H 2 O Δ G r ° ′ = - 364 kJ / mol (R3) glucose → n - butyrate - + H + + 2 H 2 + 2 CO 2 Δ G r ° ′ = - 266 kJ / mol Energy calculations showed that all carboxylates production reactions from glucose are feasible and that tuning hydrogen and carbon dioxide levels in the headspace is not sufficient to direct fermentation reactions towards a single product. This makes it more difficult to know how to drive fermentation reactions from real organic waste."
9,Carboxylates were the main fermentation products,"3.2 Carboxylates were the main fermentation products As a substrate, a real organic waste stream from a potato processing industry was used. As can be seen from Table 2 , the characteristics of the waste material batches varied although they were collected from the same point of the industrial process. This caused extra variations in product spectrum apart from the controlled parameters. However the reason of using real waste streams instead of pure substrates such as glucose was to obtain scalable results and increase the practical relevance of the study. Although waste composition differed among the batches, the control reactors always produced a mixture of carboxylates and changes in product spectrum due to the modified headspace could be evaluated for each case. The incoming waste often contained lactate concentrations above 1gCOD/L and lactate concentration in the incoming feed changed with the waste stream collected at different times. Typically, lactate was consumed. In all experiments, total carboxylates constituted over 85% of the total products and the main carboxylates were acetate, propionate and n-butyrate. Alcohols and n-caproate (C6) were lower than 10%, except for a few cases. Ethanol was the main alcohol product. Methane was not detected in any of the experiments."
10,External hydrogen addition increased total carboxylate concentrations,"3.3 External hydrogen addition increased total carboxylate concentrations Fig. 2 illustrates that applying a 2bar hydrogen partial pressure into the headspace increases total carboxylate production after 4weeks of incubation with approximately 1.5g COD compared to the control with initial substrate concentrations of 8 and 13.5gCOD/L. For these two experiments, hydrogen consumption from the headspace was 0.8g COD and 0.5g COD. This indicates that the increase in carboxylate concentrations was well above the COD consumption as hydrogen from the headspace. The difference is due to the higher hydrolysis degrees obtained under 2bar of hydrogen compared to the control reactors (Table 3 ). At the highest initial substrate concentration, the total carboxylate increase was 0.7g COD higher than in the control reactor and hydrogen consumption was 1g COD. Total carboxylate production was elevated not only by applying external hydrogen. By increasing the substrate concentration from 8 to 23gCOD/L, under hydrogen headspace, the increase in the concentrations of acetate and n-butyrate was 2 times higher than the increase in the control reactor except for the control reactor in the 23gCOD/L experiment. However fractions in total remained the same in all experiments after 4weeks of incubation. n-Butyrate fraction remained at around 42% and acetate at 33% (Fig. 2 and Table 3). This indicates that the product distribution was mainly determined by the hydrogen in the headspace. Because a major single carboxylate was not found by applying 2bar of hydrogen, it seems that hydrogen supply to the headspace is not promising for selective production of a single compound. n-Butyrate and acetate were always the main products with 2bar hydrogen headspace while propionate was never observed at fractions higher than 10%. The change in the control reactor spectrum was sometimes quite big at different substrate concentrations. At the lowest substrate concentration test, for instance, acetate and propionate were the major products. The propionate fraction reached up to 33%. When substrate concentration increased, the fermentation type shifted from acetate-propionate to acetate-butyrate. The final n-butyrate concentration in the highest substrate concentration experiment reached up to 10gCOD/L with a 68% fraction of the total products. In a mixed culture environment, a shift in populations can occur due to a change in environmental conditions or chosen operational parameters. Such a shift can be a result of a different pH and/or hydrogen partial pressure of the system (Vavilin et al., 1995). For example, n-butyrate producing organisms dominated a microbial population at a pH lower than 5, whereas acetate and propionate producing organisms were predominant at a pH higher than 5.5 (Fang and Liu, 2002). In our experiments, the pH dropped to 4.2 for both reactors which resulted both in high propionate and high n-butyrate concentrations. So it is assumed that the pH had a minor effect on the product type (Table 3). Hydrogen partial pressure levels, however, differed. With increasing substrate concentration the produced hydrogen in the headspace was increased. Thermodynamically, propionate production was expected to be favorable at elevated levels of hydrogen since it is accompanied with hydrogen consumption (R2) (Agler et al., 2011). However, we never observed propionate in any of the hydrogen applied headspace cases. Our results thus show that although thermodynamically it is favorable, propionate production is not always higher at a high hydrogen partial pressure. This is confirmed by the control experiment. There we observed also that fermentation reactions shifted from propionate to n-butyrate when the produced amount of hydrogen increased. The variations in the waste composition might also cause changes in product distribution or concentrations as observed for the product spectrum differences in the control reactor (Fig. 2). For instance, in the experiment with the highest substrate concentration, the hydrolysis degrees were equal to 100% for both the 2bar hydrogen and the control reactors whereas this was not the case for the other experiments (Table 3). This shows that the organic waste which was collected the 2nd time was more easily hydrolyzed and degradable comparing to the first batch of waste material. This might also have reflected in the shift from propionate to n-butyrate. In the 2bar hydrogen reactor an increase in longer chain carboxylates was observed. n-Caproate was the 3rd main product after acetate and n-butyrate produced in the hydrogen headspace systems. The highest n-caproate production, 0.8gCOD/L reaching up to 11%, was observed with the lowest substrate concentration within 4weeks of fermentation whereas it did not occur in the control reactor. Microorganisms can use VFA as electron acceptor and hydrogen or ethanol as electron donor to generate medium chain fatty acids such as n-caproate (Steinbusch et al., 2011). These reactions are described as: (R4) acetate - + 2 ethanol → 2 n - caproate - + 2 H 2 O Δ G r ° ′ = - 79 kJ / mol (R5) acetate - + H + + 2 H 2 → ethanol + H 2 O Δ G r ° ′ = - 9 kJ / mol (R6) 3 acetate - + 2 H + + 4 H 2 → n - caproate - + 4 H 2 O Δ G r ° ′ = - 177 kJ / mol (R7) acetate - + n - butyrate - + H + + 2 H 2 → n - caproate - + 2 H 2 O Δ G r ° ′ = - 48 kJ / mol The presence of hydrogen is thermodynamically favorable for formation of more reduced products such as ethanol and caproic acid (with a higher degree of reduction). In our experiment, ethanol was not consumed; on the contrary, ethanol production for each hydrogen reactor was at least two times higher than in the control reactors (Table 3). Since hydrogen was consumed and ethanol and n-caproate were formed, the likely explanation is (R4) might have coupled with (R5). n-Caproate production could also have occurred via (R6) and/or (R7) by using hydrogen, acetate and n-butyrate. In the end, elevated ethanol production together with n-caproate production under hydrogen pressurized headspace supports the fact that chain elongation of short chain fatty acids like acetate and n-butyrate in the presence of hydrogen is possible as was mentioned by Ding et al. (2010) and Steinbusch et al. (2011)."
11,External carbon dioxide addition favored n-butyrate production at low substrate concentration,"3.4 External carbon dioxide addition favored n-butyrate production at low substrate concentration Applying 2bar of carbon dioxide to the headspace resulted in a lower total carboxylate production after 1week of incubation when compared to the control reactor. This can be due to inhibitory effect of carbon dioxide as also discussed in our previous study (Arslan et al., 2012). However, after 4weeks of incubation, such effects were no longer visible. The total carboxylate production in the reactors under 2bar carbon dioxide was either slightly higher than in the controls for the 8 and 13.5gCOD/L substrate concentration experiments. Total carboxylates in the 2bar carbon dioxide reactor were even similar to the control for the 23gCOD/L substrate concentration condition (Fig. 2). This might be due to the higher levels of hydrogen production and subsequent consumption from the headspace in the control reactor of the last experiment. Indeed, in the 8 and 13.5gCOD/L substrate concentrations experiments, hydrogen productions were negligible in both control reactors. In the experiment at the highest substrate concentration however, the hydrogen fraction in the headspace of the control reactor reached 27% and dropped to 4% by the end of the experiment due to consumption. Another reason might be that in the highest substrate concentration experiment, as mentioned earlier, the composition of the waste was different and it was observed that this waste batch was more easily degradable as shown from hydrolysis degree calculations. This indicates that for this experiment kinetics were different. Carbohydrate conversion to carboxylates, hydrogen and carbon dioxide was faster in the last experiment than for the experiments run with the previously collected waste material. Applying 2bar carbon dioxide to the headspace reactors changed product fractions and concentrations compared to the control reactors (Fig. 2). The main product was always n-butyrate. Especially in the 1st week of the experiments, there was a significant selective n-butyrate production with fractions reaching up to 78% with the 8 and 13.5gCOD/L initial substrate concentrations. After the 1st week, the acetate production rate increased, so n-butyrate fraction in the total carboxylate production dropped to approximately 50% for these two experiments, while it was only 17% in the control reactors. Concentrations of n-butyrate were also 3 and 4 times higher than in the control reactors. Carbon dioxide consumption in the 8 and 13.5gCOD/L substrate concentration experiments were 5.6 and 12.3mM which was rather low compared to the total product concentrations. Even when carbon dioxide consumption in the reactions was not significant, the presence of such a high carbon dioxide partial pressure can shift the equilibria of reactions and impact the product spectrum if it is present at sufficiently high pressure (Arslan et al., 2012). At the initial substrate concentration of 23gCOD/L, the n-butyrate fraction and concentration in the 2bar carbon dioxide reactor was lower than in the control reactors. In the former, the n-butyrate fraction was only 48% while it was 73% in the control and its concentration remained 3gCOD/L lower than in the control reactor. This shows that the effect of carbon dioxide was less outspoken at the elevated initial substrate concentrations. High levels of substrate concentrations apparently already drove fermentation reactions to production of n-butyrate even without carbon dioxide addition."
12,There are two ways to steer organic waste fermentation towards n-butyrate,"3.5 There are two ways to steer organic waste fermentation towards n-butyrate n-Butyrate is a valuable carboxylate compound which can be used directly in the chemical, plastic, and textile industry or can be used as substrate for the production of fuels such as butanol (Zigova and Sturdik, 2000). In this study, it was thus found that n-butyrate production could be selectively increased under two conditions: (1) by applying carbon dioxide in the headspace if substrate concentration is below 13.5gCOD/L, (2) by sufficiently increasing substrate concentration without any headspace modification. Under the 1st condition, the n-butyrate fraction could be selectively increased as high as 75% but the n-butyrate concentration remained low. Under the 2nd condition, both n-butyrate concentration and fraction could be increased. In both ways, it seems that a 1week incubation period is enough to achieve selective n-butyrate production higher than 70%. Common knowledge of the acetate-butyrate type fermentation is that acetate production from glucose yields 4 ATP and n-butyrate yields 3 ATP (Kleerebezeem and Stams, 2000; Zhang et al., 2009). Because acetate production provides more energy it is more likely that acetate is mainly produced in the growth phase (R1). In the mean time, hydrogen and carbon dioxide accumulate in the system which may lead to a shift from acetate production to n-butyrate since n-butyrate production generates less hydrogen (R2). However, in this study, the opposite occurred. A reason for the high n-butyrate concentrations and fraction at the beginning of the experiments might be that acid forming bacteria fermenting glucose to propionate and n-butyrate are faster growing organisms than acetate producers (Mosey, 1983; Mohan et al., 2007). Therefore acetate production started later with assimilation by slow-growing acetogens. Another reason might be the high lactate concentration in the waste material. Lactate concentrations were 0.9gCOD/L in the first, 1.5gCOD/L in the second experiment and 2.2gCOD/L in the last experiment. In the experiments where the influent had the lowest lactate concentrations, the n-butyrate concentrations were indeed lower comparing to the experiment with high lactate concentration in the feed. A study by Kim et al. (2012) showed that addition of lactic acid into a feed together with glucose, increased n-butyrate production almost 30% in a batch-wise fermentation process. Conversion of lactate to n-butyrate was previously observed with single anaerobic bacteria by Duncan et al. (2004) and with a mixed consortium by Brummeler and Koster (1989). With the mixed consortium, first 1mol of glucose is converted to 2mol of lactate then to 1mol of n-butyrate (R8). This reaction occurs at pH values higher than the pKa value of n-butyrate/butyric acid (pH>4.8). n-Butyrate formation from lactate for the low pH range was described according to (R9) in Agler et al. (2011). However, our results do not match with the stoichiometry of (R9). Besides, (R9) is only favorable when it is coupled with acetate reduction (R10) (Agler et al., 2011). As such, hydrogen partial pressures can be kept low enough by (R10) or other hydrogen consuming reactions to keep the (R9) thermodynamically feasible. In our study, during the n-butyrate production period, acetate and hydrogen were not consumed however, so this route is less plausible. We do realize that the production of hydrogen could have been equal to the consumption of hydrogen for the production of n-butyrate. This makes it rather difficult to determine the exact mechanism for its production. The observed hydrogen and carbon dioxide production levels were also too low if you assume that n-butyrate was produced only via (R3). Therefore, n-butyrate might have been formed through a combination of (R3) and (R8) within the first week of incubation. The produced hydrogen and carbon dioxide from (R3) and (R8) might then have been consumed within other intermediate fermentation reactions. Finally, butyric acid production might have stopped when its concentration reached inhibitory levels. These amounted to 50mM for mixed culture fermentation (van den Heuvel et al., 1992). (R8) glucose → 2 lactate - → n - butyrate - + H + + 2 H 2 + 2 CO 2 (R9) 2 lactate - + H + → n - butyrate - + 2 H 2 + 2 CO 2 Δ G r ° ′ = - 209 kJ / mol (R10) 2 acetate - + H + + 2 H 2 → n - butyrate - + 2 H 2 O Δ G r ° ′ = - 48 kJ / mol The other way to increase the n-butyrate fractions and concentrations is to apply high substrate concentration without adding external headspace. Here, our observations are in line with literature. Increase in n-butyrate concentration with increasing substrate concentration was for instance also observed by Fang et al. (2006) in a batch-wise reactor. The highest n-butyrate concentration of 61mM was obtained at highest substrate concentration."
13,Batch results were confirmed in continuous mode,"3.6 Batch results were confirmed in continuous mode A continuous reactor was run to validate the results obtained in the batch experiments. Such validation is crucial as for practical applications a continuous reactor is preferred because it (i) is easier to operate, (ii) allows steady state operation under optimal conditions, and (iii) is more robust to perturbations. According to the batch experiments, n-butyrate production could be maximized to 10gCOD/L with almost 73% fraction without applying external hydrogen or carbon dioxide (Table 3). This result was obtained within 1week of batch fermentation. Therefore, 2days HRT was considered to be enough for the continuous test. The pH of the system was regulated at 4.0, since this was the pH of the batch reactor where n-butyrate reached its maximum levels. Besides, from an economical point of view, regulating the pH around 4.0 would reduce the base consumption compared to higher pH values. Fig. 3 represents the product distribution and the concentrations for 64days of operation. Carboxylate concentrations continuously increased until 25days after the start-up. Due to technical problems with the grinder pump of the feeding tank, the amount of total fresh solids entering to the reactor was less in between the days 25 and 40 than before. In this period, carboxylate production declined somehow. Once the problems were solved, the production increased further and leveled off in the last 10days of the experiment. The average COD recovery in this final period was 95% (±25%) and the average carboxylate concentration increase was 12.3gCOD/L. Most important results were that selective n-butyrate production was achieved in the first 40days of the run (Fig. 3). The average n-butyrate concentration increase was 5.7gCOD/L. This constituted 92% of the total carboxylate production which is in fact, comparable with single culture conversion results under sterilized conditions. However, in this stage, the n-butyrate concentration was lower than in the batch experiment with the same condition (Fig. 3). The mechanism of n-butyrate production might have been (R3) together with (R8), since both glucose and lactate were consumed. However, in that case more hydrogen and carbon dioxide should have been formed. Maybe the produced hydrogen and carbon dioxide from (R3) and (R8) was consumed within other intermediate fermentation reactions. Since acetate consumption was also observed in this stage of the experiment, (R9) and (R10) could take place as intermediate reactions. In these two reactions lactate and acetate are consumed together with hydrogen to produce n-butyrate. The highest n-butyrate concentration was generated after 40days of the continuous experiment. When lactate and acetate concentration in the feed dropped to 0, the average n-butyrate concentration increased from 5.7 to 9gCOD/L. This was the highest and also the potentially inhibitory level of n-butyrate obtained in the batch experiment. In the mean time, acetate production started and the fractions of n-butyrate dropped. As a result, the selectivity of n-butyrate production decreased from 92% to 74% (data not shown). In this period of the experiment, the H2 yield was 0.45mol/g sugars converted. Continuous production of n-butyrate at the highest concentration under the selected conditions was thus validated for 60days. However, when aiming at the production of valuable biochemicals, rather than the highest concentration, obtaining the highest fraction of one compound could be more desirable since product separation is easier. Hence, it is more interesting to maintain the conditions of the first 40days of the continuous experiment. For that, acetate producers could be washed out by reducing the HRT. The increasing n-butyrate fraction and concentration with the elevated substrate concentrations can be explained by the difference of available electrons levels. Under the condition of high fresh substrate concentration, the amount of available electrons/reactor increases. The vast amount of electrons/reactor leads to a shift in reactions towards more reduced compounds such as n-butyrate. This finding was also observed in the study of Badiei et al. (2011). They found n-butyrate with fractions higher than 70% at increasing substrate concentration daily fed into the reactor. The amount of electrons readily available in the reactor also depends on the HRT and type of substrate material. At longer HRTs or even at shorter HRTs but with increasing organic load and easily hydrolyzing waste materials, reactions can shift towards even more reduced compounds. For instance, Lim et al. (2008) observed n-caproate instead of n-butyrate at increasing organic loadings of food type waste at higher HRT values than in our study. The amount of available electrons in the reactor might also change the dominant microbial population in the reactor and cause a shift in product spectrum towards n-butyrate formation. Acetate production remained negligible compared to n-butyrate production and only started in the last 25days of the experiment (Fig. 3). Simultaneously, a slight decrease in hydrogen partial pressure was observed. It could be that homoacetogens produced acetate from hydrogen and carbon dioxide which were produced from the waste material. However, the amount of consumed hydrogen was not enough to generate the acetate produced and no decrease in the carbon dioxide was observed. In fact, also in the batch experiments n-butyrate concentrations were higher than acetate at the beginning of the experiments. As also explained earlier, this might be due to slow-growing acetogens comparing to n-butyrate and propionate forming bacteria. Another remarkable thing is the correlation between propionate production and lactate consumption. At the point where lactate concentration in the incoming waste decreased, propionate concentration increased from 0.4 to 1gCOD/L (Fig. 3). In the meantime, 4mM of hydrogen was consumed from the headspace. When lactate concentration in the waste elevated again propionate disappeared in the reactor and the hydrogen consumption stopped. Propionate was thus assumed to be produced from hydrogen and glucose because the amounts of consumed hydrogen and produced propionate fit the stoichiometry of (R2). Overall, this experiment achieved continuous n-butyrate production with high selectivity (92%) for over a month with organic waste substrate. Still it is difficult to determine the exact conversion mechanism of each product since the analyzed concentrations only reveal a net production or consumption and the overall conversion rates, but not the individual production and consumption of each compound."
14,Conclusions,"Thermodynamics indicated that carboxylate production reactions from glucose are all spontaneous under standard conditions and increasing hydrogen or carbon dioxide up to 5bar is not enough to direct mixed culture fermentation towards a single product. Our experiments showed that hydrogen or carbon dioxide in headspace helps selective carboxylate formation. n-Butyrate fraction increased under 2bar carbon dioxide in headspace. At elevated substrate concentrations, the effect of carbon dioxide on n-butyrate formation was limited and n-butyrate increased without headspace manipulation. This research demonstrated two methods for selective n-butyrate production in batch mixed culture processes and validated the results in continuous operation."
