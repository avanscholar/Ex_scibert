0,Introduction,"Furfuryl alcohol is an initial monomer which is essentially used for the production of thermoset materials, synthetic fibers, or moisture-proof coating agents [1,2]. A well-known process to synthesize the alcohol is the hydrogenation of furfural using copper chromite as a catalyst [3]. The method is considered to be one of biomass valorization techniques to upgrade furfural, a biomass-derived platform molecule in fine chemistry, to be other high-value added chemicals. This method causes environmental pollutions due to the high toxicity of Cr2O3 presented in the synthetic route [4]. Therefore, other transition metal-based catalysts, such as Pd, Rh, Ru, Pt, Ir, Cu, Ni, and Co, which are less-toxic choices have been utilized to replace the copper chromite catalysts for both gas phase and liquid phase furfural hydrogenation [3,5–13]. However, high hydrogen pressure (∼1000–1500 psi) is still required for the reaction. To avoid the high-pressure process, a catalytic transfer hydrogenation via the Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley (MPV) reaction has been reported. This alternative method used organic molecules such as i-propanol as hydrogen donor instead of H2 gas [14–16]. So, it is cost-effective and safe for industrial operation on a large scale, compared to the conventional hydrogenation. Since the first development of MPV, many attempts to improve catalytic activity of catalysts for this reaction have been devoted [17–28]. Zr-based catalysts including ZrO2 (zirconia) and Zr-zeolite have been verified to catalyze the transfer hydrogenation reaction [29–37]. For example, Gonell et al. reported the catalytic performance of zirconia and compared with that of Zr-BEA zeolite for the Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reaction of cyclohexanone with propan-2-ol [30]. They found remarkable activity of monoclinic zirconia that it not only decreases the activation energy of rate-determining step but also stabilizes reactant distribution on its surface. Additionally, Zr-BEA zeolites have been proved to provide higher intrinsic reactivity as compared to the zirconia catalysts. Also, the ability of Zr-zeolite to promote the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of furfural with secondary alcohols, was also reported by Koehle et al. [31]. They found that Zr-BEA (1.8 min−1) provided turnover frequency than Sn-BEA (0.51 min−1). We previously demonstrated the role of cations exchanged Lewis acid on BEA zeolite for the furfural catalytic transfer hydrogenation to furfuryl alcohol [38]. We found that the catalytic activity of Li-Zr-BEA and Li-Hf-BEA was comparable and higher than Li-Sn-BEA. However, the influence of the cation exchange on Zr-zeolite and also the zeolite pore structures on the complete reaction mechanism have not been studied in details. In this work, we investigate the complete pathway for the catalytic transfer hydrogenation reaction of furfural with i-propanol to produce furfuryl alcohol over cations exchanged Zr containing zeolites by means of the density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the M06-L. We analyze the structures and energetics of the adsorptions, the reaction coordinates, and also linear scaling relationships to comprehend the influence of cations and zeolite pore structures on the details of reactions occurring in various zeolites."
1,Computational models and details,"All structural models of zeolites were generated from their lattice structure database [39]. Different pore structures of BEA, ZSM-5 and FAU zeolites were represented by 38T, 34T, and 38T cluster models, respectively. The 38T cluster model of BEA zeolite covers the intersection of two perpendicular 12-membered ring channel as illustrated in Fig. 1 a. The 34T ZSM-5 model covers the intersection region of a straight channel and a zigzag channel (see Fig. 1b). For the FAU zeolite, the 38T cluster model is symmetrically extended from 12T of the 12-membered-ring (MR) window to cover tetrahedral atoms around the window. These additional atoms connect to two supercages of FAU as shown in Fig. 1c. The Lewis acid site was modeled by substitution of a silicon by tetravalent Zr atom at the position T9, T12, and T2; in BEA, ZSM-5, and FAU, respectively [40–42]. The hydroxylation process of these zeolite models results in an open Lewis site which includes a hydroxylated zirconium site (Zr−OH) connecting to a silanol (Si−OH) group [41]. The silanol proton can be exchanged by another cation. So, the models of each zeolites were modified by exchanging the proton with Li, Na and K cations (see Fig. 1 for Li-exchanged model). All structural models were optimized by the M06-L density functional [43]. In our previous studies, this method was successfully used to study hydrocarbon reactions where the adsorption energies and activation energies compared well with the experimental results [44–49]. The 6−31 G (d,p) basis set was employed for the Si, C, O, H, Li, Na and K atoms, while the Stuttgart Effective Core Potential basis (ECP) was employed for Zr and Sn atoms [50]. During the calculations, the entire zeolite structures and adsorbing molecules, except the terminating hydrogen atoms, were allowed to relax. To verify and confirm the intermediates and transition state structure along the reaction coordinates, vibration frequency calculations were performed at the same level of theory (M06-L). The results from such calculations also provide Gibbs free energies at a 298 K and 1 atm. All calculations were performed in the Gaussian 16 Revision B.01 [51]. Turnover frequencies (TOFs) were thereafter computed for the reaction by using the energy span model [52] as shown Eq. (1): (1) T O F = k B T h e − Δ G r / R T - 1 ∑ i = 1 , j = 0 N e ( T i − I j − δ G i j / R T ) Where k B is Boltzmann’s constant, T is temperature, h is Planck’s constant, R is gas constant, N is the number of steps in the catalytic cycle, ΔG r is the reaction Gibbs free energy, Ti is the energies of transition states, Ij is the energies of intermediates, and δGij is equal to ΔG r if i > j, or zero if i ≤ j. The TOFs in Eq. (1) need to be calculated through adsorption and desorption steps that there is no connecting transition state, the free energy of the transition states is set as the free energy of the adsorption and the product complex, respectively [53]."

3,Catalytic transfer hydrogenation reaction of furfural to furfuryl alcohol,"3.1 Catalytic transfer hydrogenation reaction of furfural to furfuryl alcohol The first section of this work is to study the structural geometry and energetic data of the catalytic pathway of the catalytic transfer hydrogenation furfural to furfuryl alcohol. A i-propanol molecule is used as a hydrogen donor on Li-Zr-BEA. The calculation results are compared to those of Li-Sn-BEA, which we use as a reference since it is well-known Lewis acidic zeolite that is widely used in hydrogenation. The catalytic transfer hydrogenation reaction mechanism proceeds via three elementary steps analogous to the Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reaction. As shown in Eqs. (2)–(4), the mechanism begins with the dissociation of the OH bond in i-propanol (1) and follows by a hydride transfer from propoxide to furfural (2). The second step leads to a furfurylmethoxy intermediate which stays on the surface. The final step is a proton abstraction to form a furfuryl alcohol as a product (3). (2) LiZr-BEA + C3H7OH → C3H7O-H-LiZr-BEA (3) C3H7O-H-LiZr-BEA + C4H3OCHO → C4H3OCH2O-H-LiZr-BEA + C2H6O (4) C4H3OCH2O-H-LiZr-BEA → LiZr-BEA + C4H3OCH2OH First, an i-propanol adsorbs on active sites of zeolite with the calculated adsorption energy of -16.0 and -11.3 kcal/mol for Li-Sn-BEA and Li-Zr-BEA, respectively (Ads in Fig. 2 ). This adsorption complex is stabilized through two interactions in which its hydroxyl oxygen (Op) bind to both tetravalent metal site and Li ion site. The distances for Sn Op and ZrO p are almost equally (see Fig. 2). The LiO p distance in both zeolites is also found to be 2.22 Å for Li-Sn-BEA and 2.30 Å for Li-Zr-BEA. It was found that charge transferred from O to active site of zeolites by +0.076e and +0.109e, for Li-Sn-BEA and Li-Zr-BEA, respectively. The results lead to more positive charge in the i-propanol. Then, the molecule reacts to produce the i-propoxide intermediate through the first transition state (TS1 in Fig. 2). The Op-H bond is cracked, leaving H atom to attach to the bridging oxygen of the zeolites. In Li-Sn-BEA, the Op-H bond is elongated by 1.30 Å and the H O distance is shortened from 0.98 to 1.16 Å. The transition states (TS1) geometries of the Li-Zr-BEA are similar to Li-Sn-BEA. The calculated activation energy for the OH bond breaking is 15.8 and 10.5 kcal/mol, for Li-Sn-BEA and Li-Zr-BEA, respectively. These energy values are considered to be lower than the general OH bond dissociation of alcohols such as methanol and ethanol on FeO-ZSM-5 and GaO-ZSM-5 zeolite and also metal surface in previous theoretical studies [46,54–56]. It is possible that the transition state on Li-Zr-BEA and Li-Sn-BEA is more stabilized by an H2O onset formation, while on FeO-ZSM-5 or GaO-ZSM-5, the OH group is formed. Moreover, it might be due to more stability of i-propoxide transition state formed in this work than methoxide and ethoxide ones obtained from the OH bond dissociation of methanol and ethanol, respectively. After the TS1, the i-propoxide intermediate is formed on the surface of the zeolite (Int1 in Fig. 2) with Sn Op and ZrO p distances of 2.10 and 2.17 Å, respectively. The complexation energy of these intermediates with respect to the i-propanol adsorption complex is endothermic as shown in Fig. 2. Subsequently, the furfural is diffused to adsorb on the Li site nearby i-propoxide intermediate (Int1_Fur in Fig. 2). The adsorption energies of furfural are -18.5 and -19.1 kcal/mol for Li-Sn-BEA and Li-Zr-BEA, respectively. The proton (H) of i-propoxide at the methylene carbon is transferred to the carbonyl Cf of furfural via the transition state TS2. In this step, the intramolecular bond length of the Cp-H is elongated, while the intermolecular Cf H bond length is shortened for both zeolites (see Fig. 2). Energy barriers for this step are calculated to be 25.8 and 20.8 kcal/mol for the reaction in Li-Sn-BEA and Li-Zr-BEA, respectively. These activation energies are found to be larger than the ones found for the corresponding reaction of Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley-Oppenauer (MPVO) on Sn-BEA and Zr-BEA [57]. The co-adsorption of furfurylmethoxy intermediate and acetone is formed after the TS2 migration (Int2 in Fig. 2) with the complexation energy of -10.5 kcal/mol for Li-Sn-BEA, and -16.7 kcal/mol for Li-Zr-BEA. This step is followed by the acetone desorption (Int2_de). The desorption energy is calculated to be 9.1 and 8.2 kcal/mol for Li-Sn-BEA and Li-Zr-BEA, respectively. Furfuryl alcohol is created by abstraction of the proton form water molecule through the furfurylmethoxy intermediate in the final process. At the transition state (TS3), the OH distance increases to 1.20 and 1.22 Å for Li-Sn-BEA and Li-Zr-BEA, respectively. The activation energy of this step is 6.1 kcal/mol for Li-Sn-BEA and 8.8 kcal/mol for Li-Zr-BEA, relative to the intermediate complex. A furfuryl alcohol molecule is generated at the end where it binds to the metal site of zeolites (Prod in Fig. 2). Its complexation energy is -19.8 and -27.7 kcal/mol for Li-Sn-BEA and Li-Sn-BEA, respectively. In terms of energetic discussion, the relative energies of the adsorption, intermediate and the transition states in Li-Zr-BEA are rather more stable than those of the Li-Sn-BEA systems, shown in Fig. 2. For both zeolite cases, the second step of the reaction is found to be the rate determining step of the reaction. In this step, the i-propoxide-furfural co-adsorption complex (Int1_Fur) and the transition state of the hydrogen transfer process (TS2) are considered to be the slowest-occurred intermediates. Their activation barriers are 20.8 and 25.8 kcal/mol for Li-Zr-BEA and Li-Sn-BEA, respectively. The energies are higher than the first step; the propanol OH bond dissociation (10.5 and 15.8 kcal/mol for Li-Zr-BEA and Li-Sn-BEA) and the furfuryl alcohol formation step (8.8 and 6.1 kcal/mol for Li-Zr-BEA and Li-Sn-BEA). The results suggest that the catalytic activity of the Li-Zr-BEA zeolite should be greater than the activities of Li-Sn-BEA. This finding is in good agreement with previous work on the MPV reduction of furfural on tetravalent metals substituted BEA zeolite [31] that reported that Zr-BEA provided higher turnover frequency and also longer half-life than Sn-BEA. Moreover, the result also agrees with the higher catalytic activity of the ZrO2 than SnO2 for catalytic transfer hydrogenation of the levulinic acid [58]. We analyze the charge transfer of the rate-determining step to understand the difference in activation energies. We find the charge transfer from the furfural molecule to the active site of zeolite for co-adsorption complex of Int1_Fur step in Li-Zr-BEA is larger than in Li-Sn-BEA leading to less negative charge accumulated on furfural CO bond in Li-Zr-BEA (-0.193e) compared to Li-Sn-BEA (-0.213e). This indicates less electron density on π-orbital of the CO bond in Li-Zr-BEA than in Li-Sn-BEA. Therefore, the charge transfer could assist the weakening of CO bond and facilitates its abstraction to the transferred proton from i-propoxide, which is quantified in a lower activation energy for Li-Zr-BEA than for Li-Sn-BEA. Furthermore, based on NBO analysis, we found that the energetically appropriated orbital interaction for transition state of the rate-determining step (TS2) is the electrons donation from the 2-center bond composed by the molecular orbital of furfural carbonyl group CO to the empty valence lone-pair orbital on the cation sites. This is shown as an example for Li-Zr-BEA in Fig. 3 . We find that the stabilization energy E(2) for Li-Zr-BEA is higher than Li-Sn-BEA (2.6 vs 1.8 kcal/mol). The results also point out the important role of electron delocalization in activating furfural CO bond which is ready to attract the transferred hydrogen from i-propoxide intermediate. The influence of alkali cations (Li, Na and K) in exchanged Zr-BEA zeolite (M-Zr-BEA) on the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol, has also been studied. Fig. 4 shows the relative free energies of all systems. The optimized structures for the reaction on Na-Zr-BEA and K-Sn-BEA are displayed in Figs. S1 and S2, respectively. Firstly, we cosider the adsorption of the i-propanol. The oxygen in hydroxide group of i-propanol molecule interacts to both Zr and cations of the zeolites. The adsorption energy on Li-Zr-BEA is slightly lower than Na-Zr-BEA and K-Zr-BEA case (see Fig. 4). The Gibbs free energies of activation of the hydroxide OH bond activation are 10.5, 14.6 and 13.4 kcal/mol for Li-Zr-BEA, Na-Zr-BEA, K-Zr-BEA, respectively. The following hydrogen transfer is found to be the rate determining step of the reaction on cation-exchanged Zr-BEA zeolite, as well as in the case of Zr-BEA zeolite. This step is therefore contributed to the catalytic activity of zeolites. The order of calculated free activation energies are Li-Zr-BEA (20.8 kcal/mol) < Na-Zr-BEA (23.9 kcal/mol) < K-Zr-BEA (28.8 kcal/mol), as shown in Fig. 4. This trend was similar to that in the same cation exchanged in Sn-BEA [35]. For the furfuryl alcohol formation step, the activation barriers are 8.8, 4.7 and 6.4 kcal/mol for Li-Zr-BEA, Na-Zr-BEA, K-Zr-BEA, respectively (Fig. 4). This step has the lowest energy barrier compared to other steps. The differnce in barrier higth and in the rate-determining step can be explained again by using the charge transfer analysis which the charges from furfural delocalize to the active site in step of Int1_Fur in Fig. 4. The stabilization energy E(2) of orbital interaction analyzed by NBO in transition state TS2 was also studied. We found the highest positive charge of furfural and the stabilization energy E(2) in Li-Zr-BEA, (0.100e and 2.58 kcal/mol, respectively). The values for Na-Zr-BEA are 0.070e and 1.37 kcal/mol, and for K-Zr-BEA are 0.062e and 0.71 kcal/mol. We also calculate turnover frequencies (TOFs) of the catalytic cycle on the zeolites. The TOF-determining transition state (TDTS) is the TS2 transition state of the H transfer (TS2) and the TOF-determining intermediate (TDI) is the furfurylmethoxy intermediate complex (Int1_Fur). As listed in Table 1 , the Li-Zr-BEA has TOFs 2 and 6 order of magnitude higher than Na-Zr-BEA and K-Zr-BEA, respectively. These findings suggest that the zeolite catalytic activity for the catalytic transfer hydrogenation reaction can be tuned by exchanging the cations into their surfaces. Similar experimental results have been reported by L. Gao et al. for the conversion of furfural to furfuryl alcohol on alkali-metal exchanged Zr-Al-Beta zeolites [59]. Such reported shown that the exchanging of alkali metals on Zr-Al-Beta zeolites can promote and tune their catalytic activity for the studied reaction. The furfural conversion rate in the initial reaction period was revealed to be in the order of Li-Zr-Al-Beta > Na-Zr-Al-Beta > K-Zr-Al-Beta. Moreover, the results also is in agreement with the experimental findings of I. D. Alshakova et al. for alkali-metal-base-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of ketones [60]."
4,Effect of zeolite pore structures,"3.2 Effect of zeolite pore structures The effect of the zeolite pore structures on the studied catalytic transfer hydrogenation reaction is also studied. We perform additional DFT calculations to investigate the reaction on Li-cation exchanged Zr-FAU and Zr-ZSM-5 zeolites. Calculated relative free energy profiles on different types of zeolites are listed in Fig. 5 . The optimized structures for the reaction on Li-Zr-ZSM-5 and Li-Zr-FAU are shown in Fig. S3 and S4, respectively. Although Li-Zr-ZSM-5 yields the more stable adsorption complex of i-propanal on its active site (adsorption energy= -15.3 kcal/mol), as compared to Li-Zr-BEA (adsorption energy= -11.3 kcal/mol) and Li-Zr-FAU (-8.9 kcal/mol); the internuclear distances of O···Zr between the adsorbed i-propanal and the zeolites in all zeolites are still noticeably comparable. This result indicates an important effect of zeolite pore confinement that is contributed by van der Waals interactions between adsorbed molecule and the zeolite walls. The predicted activation energies for i-propanal OH bond dissociation in all zeolites are almost the same (∼10 kcal/mol). This step can thus be explained by the different adsorption energies of the i-propanal reactant. The hydrogen transfer process in step 2 of the reaction on Li-Zr-ZSM-5 and Li-Zr-FAU is the rate determining step similar to that on Li-Zr-BEA reported above. The activation free energy in the Li-Zr-BEA system (20.8 kcal/mol) is comparable to that of Li-Zr-ZSM-5 (21.0 kcal/mol). However, the Li-Zr-FAU provides slightly higher energy (24.5 kcal/mol). This is due to the less confinement effect of the FAU zeolite to stabilize the transition state structure (TS2 in Fig. 5). In the final step, the furfuryl alcohol product is formed from hydrogen abstracting by furfurylmethoxy intermediate oxygen with the energy barriers of 8.8, 15.5 and 15.4 kcal/mol for Li-Zr-BEA, Li-Zr-ZSM-5 and Li-Zr-FAU, respectively. The turnover frequencies (TOFs) of zeolites are also calculated. It was found that the TDTS is TS2 for all zeolite cases and the TDI is Int1_Fur for BEA and ZSM-5 cases and is Int2 for FAU. The TOFs at the studied temperature are slightly higher for Li-Zr-BEA (3.4 × 10−3 s-1) than Li-Zr-ZSM-5 (2.5 × 10-3 s-1) and these values are 3 orders of magnitude higher than the value of Li-Zr-FAU (2.5 × 10-6 s-1). It can be concluded from this result that medium pore zeolites could provide higher activity for furfural catalytic transfer hydrogenation reaction than the large pore ones."
5,Correlations of barrier height and reactivity descriptors,"3.3 Correlations of barrier height and reactivity descriptors The correlations between free energy barriers and selected reactivity descriptors i.e. complexation energy of intermediates and electronic properties of catalysts, have been analyzed to understand the catalytic activity trend of zeolites. Such descriptors might be used to screen catalytic materials for the catalytic transfer hydrogenation reaction. In general, rate determining step highly relates to the catalytic performance of zeolite. So, we focus in this main step. First, a correlation between the activation free energy barriers on one side and the LUMO or electrophilicity indexes (ω) of zeolite catalysts on the other side is plotted (see Fig. 6 ). The indexes directly relate to Lewis acidity of catalysts. All calculation details of ω are given in Supplementary data. We found moderate correlations between the barriers and the LUMO energy (R2 = 0.60) and also with electrophilicity indexes (R2 = 0.61). Note that the R2 calculation and evaluation are presented in Supplementary data. We can conclude from the results that both LUMO energy and ω of catalysts are inferior to be used as descriptors for explaining the reaction. A stronger relationship between the activation barriers and the complexation energies of co-adsorption complex Int1_Fur is observed with the R2 = 0.92 as shown in Fig. 6c. The complexation energy might be therefore the most suitable single descriptor for an approximation of the activation barrier. We also found that the step Int1_Fur and the transition state TS2 are more stable with reduction of the exchanged cation size (see Figs. 4 and 6c), leading to less activation barrier. This finding confirms tunability of zeolites performance in catalyzing the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol by exchange of cations into their frameworks."
6,Conclusions,"The catalytic transfer hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol by using i-propanol as hydrogen donor over cation-exchanged Zr zeolite surface has been studied. According to M06-L density functional calculations, the proposed reaction follows three steps; the dissociation hydroxyl group of i-propanol, the hydrogen transfer from i-propoxide to furfural, and the production of furfuryl alcohol via a hydrogen abstraction. The second step which contains hydrogen transfer is considered to be the rate-determining step of the reaction. In this step, the Li-Zr-BEA requires lower activation free energy than Li-Sn-BEA by 5 kcal/mol, indicating that Li-Zr-BEA is more active. The higher activity of Li-Zr-BEA arises from larger charge transfer from the furfural carbonyl bond to the catalyst. The catalytic performance is also arises from its larger stabilization energy E(2) of the electron delocalization leading to in activating furfural CO bond readily for attracting the transferred hydrogen. We also considered the catalytic influence of alkali cation (Li, Na and K) exchanged on Zr-BEA zeolite. The Li-Zr-BEA shows the higher catalytic potential for this reaction than Na-Zr-BEA and K-Zr-BEA. The calculated activation free energy in the rate-determining step is 20.8, 21.0 and 24.5 kcal/mol for Li-Zr-BEA, Li-Zr-ZSM-5, and Li-Zr-FAU, respectively. The trend of these barrier heights was found to be related to TOFs. The catalytic activity of Li-Zr-BEA zeolite should be comparable with Li-Zr-ZSM-5 but higher than that of Li-Zr-FAU. Thus, the catalytic activity of medium pore zeolites could outperform the large pore ones. Finally, we evaluate the correlations between free energy barriers and selected reactivity descriptors i.e. complexation energy of intermediates (Int1_Fur) and electronic properties of catalysts. With good relationship, the complexation energy might be employed as descriptor for an approximation of the catalytic activity of the zeolites towards the hydrogen transfer in catalytic transfer hydrogenation reaction. Moreover, with exchanged cation size reduction, the complexation energy and the hydrogen transfer transition state are found to be more stable leading to less activation barrier. This finding indicate that the catalytic activity of zeolites for the furfural catalytic transfer hydrogenation to furfuryl alcohol reaction can be tuned by exchanging the cations into their framework."
