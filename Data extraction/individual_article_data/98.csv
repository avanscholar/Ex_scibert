0,Introduction,"A shortage of energy with a higher price due to continued increasing consumption of fossil fuels especially oil and natural gas is currently a hot issue. Therefore, renewable energy sources are being considered as alternatives to replace partially the consumption of fossil fuels. Among alternative fuels, hydrogen is the most attractive one because it produces only water as an end product after combustion and it also gives a high-energy yield (per unit weight). Hence, hydrogen has been suggested as a future fuel [1]. Additionally, hydrogen is an idea reactant to generate electricity through fuel cells [2]. Hydrogen can be produced in several ways: catalytic reforming of natural gas, pyrolysis or gasification of biomass, and electrolysis of water. The steam reforming of natural gas is currently used commercially to produce hydrogen. However, the process basically requires both high temperature and pressure for operation, leading to a high operational cost and some difficulties in operation. Moreover, the coke formation and the catalyst sintering problems can cause substantial reduction in the catalytic activity of the reforming process [3–6]. Another interesting technique to produce hydrogen is by a biological process because it can be operated under ambient conditions [1]. The biological hydrogen production processes can be classified into 2 types: dark and photo fermentation. The dark fermentation process is more favorable due to its constant production of hydrogen without the need of light and it becomes economical when waste materials especially highly concentrated organic wastewaters are used to produce hydrogen. Cassava wastewater [7], food waste [8], starch wastewater [9], wheat powder solution [10], and industrial wastes [11] are source of the materials currently used. Sreethawong et al. [7], studied hydrogen production from cassava wastewater and achieved a specific hydrogen production rate (SHPR) of 388 ml H2/g VSS d and a hydrogen yield of 158 l/COD removed. Furthermore, there are some parameters, such as temperature, controlled pH, organic loading rate, cycle duration, hydraulic retention time (HRT), and toxic compound present in an incoming wastewater that have been considered to affect hydrogen production performance. Shin et al. [8], found that hydrogen production from food waste under thermophilic conditions was higher than that under mesophilic conditions. Another study showed the pH-dependency for hydrogen production from cassava starch, with suitable pH level (5.5 and 6.0) that displayed better hydrogen production performances and produced a better environment for the cells to utilize starch for growth [12]. In this present work, the wastewater from an alcohol production plant using cassava roots as a raw material was, for the first time, used to produce hydrogen using an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) under thermophilic operation. The uptakes and transformation of nitrogen compounds and phosphate were also investigated at different COD loading rates. This paper is the first part of series of our group's research to investigate the ability of thermophiles to degrade the cellulosic residues present in this studied alcohol wastewater which is preliminarily removed before being fed to the existing biogas unit of the factory. In our next study, the ASBR will be operated under the optimum conditions obtained from this work with different added loadings of the cellulosic residues in order to determine an optimum loading of the cellulosic residues for maximization of hydrogen production. The ultimate goal of the project is to utilize the cellulosic residues to co-produce hydrogen and to improve the performance of the existing biogas production unit of the factory by applying the acidogenic step for hydrogen production as a pretreatment step of the existing biogas production plant."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Seed sludge preparation,"2.1 Seed sludge preparation Seed sludge collected from the biogas plant at Sapthip Lopburi Co., Ltd., Thailand, was first concentrated by sedimentation, and the concentrated sludge was then ground and screened by sieving to remove large sand particles. In order to eliminate methane-producing bacteria or hydrogen consumers, the seed sludge was boiled for 15 min [4,10,13–16]. The heat-treated sludge was then added to an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR). The microbial concentration in terms of MLVSS (mixed liquid volatile suspended solids) for a start-up in this study was about 20,000 mg/l."
3,Alcohol wastewater,"2.2 Alcohol wastewater Alcohol wastewater was also obtained from Sapthip Lopburi Co., Ltd., Thailand, where cassava roots are used as a raw material for alcohol fermentation. Hence, the wastewater obtained from the bottom of distillation columns still contains a large quantity of unfermented residues which are preliminarily removed before being pumped to the existing biogas production plant of the factory. The alcohol wastewater collected was filtered through a 0.2 mm sieve to remove any large solid particles and kept at below 4 °C before use. The alcohol wastewater had a chemical oxygen demand (COD) value of 60,000 mg/l and a COD nitrogen and phosphorous ratio of 100:7:1.3, indicating that the wastewater contains sufficient amounts of both nutrients (N and P) for anaerobic degradation (the theoretical ratio of COD:N:P = 100:1:0.4 for anaerobic decomposition for biogas production) (Table 1 ). Therefore, an addition of nutrients was not required in this study. Interestingly, most of the nitrogen in the wastewater was in the form of organic nitrogen with a significant amount of nitrate-nitrogen. The low pH (3.4) of the alcohol wastewater resulted from a high volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration (5080 mg/l as acetic acid) and the high VFA results from the self-degradation under anaerobic condition in the wastewater pond."
4,ASBR operation,"2.3 ASBR operation Two identical units of anaerobic sequencing batch reactors (ASBR) were used independently to perform hydrogen production at different COD loading rates. The possibilities of photosynthesis bacteria activity was inhibited by using PVC material in the construction of the bioreactors. Each of reactors had an inner diameter of 13 cm and a height of 30 cm. The bioreactors were operated with a liquid working volume of 4 l. The experimental set-up of the studied ASBR was given elsewhere [7]. The ASBR operation consisted of 4 steps: feeding, reacting, settling, and decanting. Each step was controlled by timers. First, for the feed step, the alcohol wastewater was introduced into the top of the reactor. A feed pump was controlled by a level probe inside the reactor to achieve a constant feed volume for each cycle. Next, the reaction step was allowed to proceed by using a magnetic stirrer at 400 rpm to achieve homogenously mixing. A heater (equipped with thermocouple) and a pH-controller (with a dosing pump for a 1 M NaOH solution) were used to maintain a constant temperature and solution pH in the ASBR, respectively. For the settling step, the magnetic stirrer was turn off to allow the microbial cells in the bioreactor to settle. Finally, for the decanting step, the solenoid valve was open by the timer to allow the clarified effluent to be drained out from the bioreactor. In this work, the ASBR reactors were operated at a temperature of 55 °C and solution pH of 5.5 [12,17]. An initial quantity of 1000 ml of heat-treated sludge was added to each of the ASBR reactors. The ASBR operation times of four sequential steps at 6 cycles per day were 15, 90, 120, and 15 min for feeding, reacting, settling, and decanting, respectively. The 6 cycles per day were used to operate the ASBR because it had been proven previously to provide the highest hydrogen production performance [7]. Table 2 shows the flow rates of either feed or decant at different COD loading rates. The ASBR reactor was operated around two weeks to reach a steady state before taking effluent and produced gas samples for analysis and measurement. Steady state conditions were attained when both effluent COD and gas production rates did not change with time. The averaged data with standard deviations were used to indicate the process performance of the studied ASBR to produce hydrogen from the alcohol wastewater at different COD loading rates."
5,Measurements and analytical methods,"2.4 Measurements and analytical methods The gas production rate was measured by using a wet gas meter (Ritter, TGO5/5). The gas composition was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC, Perkin–Elmer, AutoSystem) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a packed column (stainless-steel 10' × 1/8′ × 0.085"" HayeSep D 100/120 mesh, Altech). Injector, column, and detector temperatures were kept at 60, 35, and 150 °C, respectively. Argon was used as the carrier gas. The total amount of volatile fatty acids (VFA) in the effluent samples was determined by the distillation and titration method [18]. The VFA composition in the effluent samples was analyzed by another gas chromatograph (Perichrom, PR2100) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a DB-WAXetr capillary column (J & W Scientific) in the splitless mode with helium as a carrier gas, hydrogen as a combustion gas, and air zero as a combustion-supporting gas. The column temperature program was started at 60 °C, heated to 125 °C at a ramping rate of 10 °C/min, held for 2 min, then heated to 180 °C at a ramping rate of 15 °C/min, and held for 15 min. The temperatures of both injector and conductor were kept constant 250 °C. The mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) in the reactor was taken during the reacting step to represent the microbial concentration and the volatile suspended solids (VSS) in effluent samples taken during the decanting step to represent the microbial washout from the system were measured according to standard methods [18]. The COD values in the feed and effluent samples were determined by the dichromate method using a COD analyzer (HACH, DR 2700). Nitrogen analyses (in terms of organic nitrogen measured by the diazotization, cadmium reduction method, and inorganic nitrogen measured by the salicylate method) in the feed and effluent samples were carried out with TNT persulfate digestion. The total phosphorous in the feed and effluent samples was determined by the molybdovanadate method with acid persulfate digestion (Hach Company). The average values of the analysis (with less than 5% standard deviation) were used to access the process performance of the ASBR system."

7,Results and discussion,
8,Organic removal and gas production results,"3.1 Organic removal and gas production results The COD removal efficiency increased with increasing COD loading rate from 45 to 68 kg/m3d and then decreased with further increasing COD loading rate from 68 to 79 kg/m3d (Fig. 1 a). The maximum COD removal was 32% at a COD loading rate of 68 kg/m3d. The increase in the COD loading rate resulted in an increase in organic compounds available for microbial degradation, leading to increased COD removal. The results can indicate that the alcohol wastewater is easily degraded anaerobically. However, at a very high COD loading rate—greater than 68 kg/m3d—the system started having high VFA, causing increasing toxicity to the microbes, thereby lowering the COD removal and the microbial concentration in the bioreactor, as shown later. The gas production rate had a similar trend to the COD removal. The optimum COD loading rate of 68 kg/m3d provided both maximum COD removal and gas production rate."
9,Hydrogen production results,"3.2 Hydrogen production results Fig. 1 b shows, under the studied conditions, the produced gas contains mainly hydrogen and carbon dioxide without methane, suggesting the methanogenic step is completely suppressed at high COD loading rates which is in a good agreement with previous results [19,20]. The hydrogen content in the produced gas increased with increasing COD loading rate and reached a maximum value of 43% at a COD loading rate of 68 kg/m3d. It decreased with further increasing COD loading rate from 68 to 79 kg/m3d. The same explanation used for the effect of COD loading rate on the COD removal can be applied for that of the gas production rate, and hydrogen content in the produced gas [7,10,19,21]. The carbon dioxide content in the produced gas had an opposite trend to the hydrogen percentage. The hydrogen production rate increased with increasing COD loading rate and reached a maximum at a COD loading rate of 68 kg/m3d (Fig. 1 b). It decreased with further increasing COD loading rate beyond 68 kg/m3d. There was an increase in the hydrogen production rate with increasing COD loading rate because of the increase in organic compounds in the system available to convert to hydrogen gas. However, with a very high COD loading rate of 79 kg/m3d, the hydrogen production rate decreased because of the toxicity from VFA accumulation, as mentioned later. The SHPR increased with increasing COD loading rate and attained a maximum value of 560 ml H2/g MLVSS d (or 2100 ml H2/l d) at a COD loading rate of 68 kg/m3d, which corresponded to the maximum hydrogen production, the maximum hydrogen percentage, and the maximum COD removal (Fig. 1 c). The SHPR decreased to 185 ml H2/g MLVSS d (or 570 ml H2/l d) with further increasing COD loading rate from 68 to 79 kg/m3d, corresponding to the decreases in the hydrogen production rate, hydrogen percentage, and COD removal. The hydrogen yield increased with increasing COD loading rate and reached a maximum value of 130 ml H2/g COD removed or 30 ml H2/g COD applied at a COD loading rate of 68 kg/m3d which also corresponded to the maximum SHPR and the maximum COD removal (Fig. 1 d). It decreased markedly to 31 ml H2/g COD removed or 5 ml H2/g COD applied with further increasing COD loading rate from 68 to 79 kg/m3d. As expected, the higher the COD removal, the higher the hydrogen production efficiency as a result of greater amounts of organic compounds being made available for the bacteria to convert to hydrogen gas. The sharp decreases in the SHPRs and the hydrogen yields at a high COD loading rate beyond 68 kg/m3d result from the toxicity of the VFA accumulation in the system which will be discussed next."
10,Volatile fatty acid (VFA) results,"3.3 Volatile fatty acid (VFA) results The total VFA increases with increasing COD loading rate, as shown in Fig. 2 . The highest total VFA concentration of 13,300 mg/l was found at a COD loading rate of 79 kg/m3d which was responsible for both reductions in COD removal and hydrogen production efficiency (Fig. 1). The increase in VFA from 8000 mg/l to 13,300 mg/l exhibited significant toxicity to the microbial activity toward hydrogen production performance (Figs. 1 and 2). It can be concluded that a maximum VFA tolerance level to the thermophiles for hydrogen production from this alcohol wastewater may be around 10,000 mg/l as acetic acid. The high VFA tolerance level of the mixed thermophiles can be explained by the fact that they have their own ability to tolerate the produced VFA and the pH solution control at 5.5 can reduce the acid association. The dissociated acids have much lower toxicity to microbes than the unionized or associated acids. The main components of VFA are acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and valeric acid, as shown in Fig. 2. Both acetic and propionic acids increased slightly with increasing COD loading rate throughout the range of COD loading rates (Fig. 2). However, butyric and valeric acids increased substantially when the COD loading rate increased from 68 to 79 kg/m3d. At any given COD loading rate, butyric acid was the highest, followed by valeric acid, acetic acid and propionic acid. A high concentration of butyric acid or acetic acid can indicate a higher hydrogen production performance [22]. In contrast, greater amounts of propionic acid can result in lowered hydrogen production performance [25]. To maximize hydrogen production performance, an anaerobic system should be operated to increase butyric acid and acetic acid concentrations with a very low propionic concentration [22–24]. O-thong et al. [25], also found that high amounts of butyric acid (6200 mg/l), and acetic acid (4300 mg/l) with a low amount of propionic acid (120 mg/l) contributed to the highest hydrogen production (from palm oil wastewater). Butyric acid and acetic acid are formed via the metabolic pathway for production of hydrogen and propionic acid is formed via the metabolic pathway for consumption of hydrogen [26]. The microbial pathways of both hydrogen production and consumption are shown in the following reactions: (6) C 6 H 12 O 6 → CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH + 2 CO 2 + 2 H 2 (7) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COOH + 4 H 2 + 2 CO 2 (8) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 → CH 3 CH 2 COOH + 2 H 2 O Another factor that can affect hydrogen production performance is the formation of ethanol, as shown in Equation (9). (9) C 6 H 12 O 6 + H 2 O → C 2 H 5 OH + CH 3 COOH + 2 H 2 + 2 CO 2 Ethanol concentration increases with increasing COD loading rate and attains a maximum value of 5600 mg/l at a COD loading rate of 68 kg/m3d, as shown in Fig. 2. The high ethanol concentration in the ASBR at any given COD loading rate attributes to the high ethanol concentration (5080 mg/l) in the alcohol wastewater (Table 1). The highest ethanol concentration corresponds to the highest hydrogen production performance (Fig. 1 c–d) which is in good agreement with previous work [27]. Apart from the production of hydrogen via the metabolism pathway of ethanol production, the produced ethanol can also reduce the acidity in the reactor, leading to increased efficiency of hydrogen production [27]."
11,Microbial concentration and microbial washout results,"3.4 Microbial concentration and microbial washout results The MLVSS decreases with increasing COD loading rate whereas the microbial washout from the system in terms of VSS increases with increasing COD loading rate from 45 to 68 kg/m3d, as shown in Fig. 3 . The microbial concentration (MLVSS) only slightly changed when the COD loading rate increased from 68 to 79 kg/m3d. The microbial washout (VSS) had an opposite trend to the microbial concentration in the system (MLVSS). The results suggest that an increase in microbial washout from the system and a decrease in the microbial concentration in the bioreactor with increasing COD loading rate (resulted from increasing VFA in the system) are responsible for the decreasing hydrogen production performance at a very high COD loading rate. Arooj et al. [9], reported that the decreasing MLVSS with decreasing hydraulic retention times (HRTs) caused the population shift of hydrogen-producing bacteria, leading to increasing hydrogen production. However, a further increase in HRT caused the system to collapse, and lowered the hydrogen production rate. The highest hydrogen production performance was found at a COD loading rate of 68 kg/m3d (Fig. 1). With the maximum hydrogen production performance, the system had the lowest microbial concentration, indicating that at this optimum COD loading rate, the system contained mostly hydrogen-producing bacteria."
12,Nitrogen and phosphorous results,"3.5 Nitrogen and phosphorous results Both nitrogen and phosphorous are known as essential nutrients for the growth of microbes, including hydrogen-producing bacteria, and the uptake of nitrogen can come from different forms of nitrogen compounds [29]. Both nutrients for the growth of hydrogen-producing bacteria and how nitrogen transformation occurs during the hydrogen production step are great of interest. Both nitrogen and phosphorous removals mirror the microbial concentration in the bioreactor, as shown in Fig. 4 a. They decreased with increasing COD loading rate and reached minimum values at a COD loading rate of 68 kg/m3d. They slightly increased with further increasing COD loading rate from 68 to 79 kg/m3d. The results confirm that the higher the microbial concentration in the system, the higher the nutrient uptakes which are fundamentally needed for the microbial growth. Under the optimum COD loading rate, the nutrient uptakes of both N and P were found to be minimal. For the studied system under the optimum COD loading rate, the observed ratio of COD:N:P was found to be 100:6:0.5, which is much higher than that for the anaerobic organic decomposition for biogas production (100:1:0.2). Argun et al., (2008) reported that the nutrient requirement for the acidogenic step for hydrogen production at 37 °C in terms of COD:N:P was 100:0.5:0.1. The high nutrient requirement for acidogenic fermentation under thermophilic temperature can be explained by the fact that thermophiles have a much high growth rate [30]. In the experiments, the system was operated under the extremely high range of COD loading rate which, in turn, stimulated a high growth rate, as indicated by both high microbial concentration and high microbial washout for any COD loading rate. As a result, both high uptakes of N and P were found in the studied system. Fig. 4 b shows the concentrations of ammonium-nitrogen, nitrate-nitrogen, nitrite-nitrogen, organic nitrogen, and total nitrogen at different COD loading rates. The concentrations of all the nitrogen-containing compounds (organic, ammonium and nitrate-nitrogen) increased with increasing COD loading rate except the nitrite-nitrogen concentration, which remained almost unchanged. The results suggest that most of the organic nitrogen was utilized by the hydrogen-producing bacteria for their growth. It has been reported that the presence of ammonium-nitrogen concentrations greater than 200 mg/l [28,31,32,35] and in the range of 800–3900 mg/l [34] showed moderate and severe toxicity to hydrogen-producing bacteria [33], respectively, suggesting that the ASBR used to treat the alcohol wastewater did not have ammonium-nitrogen toxicity. The concentration of nitrate-nitrogen decreased with increasing COD loading rate. Denitrifying bacteria are responsible for the nitrate reduction under anaerobic condition. Most of the nitrogen uptake came from the organic nitrogen. As confirmed experimentally, the nitrogen gas produced by the denitrifying bacteria was very low and could not be detected in the produced gas. Hence, under the thermophilic temperature of the acidogenic step, denitrification cannot occur and the hydrogen-producing bacteria may be responsible for the nitrate uptake."
13,Comparisons of thermophilic and mesophilic for hydrogen production performance,"3.6 Comparisons of thermophilic and mesophilic for hydrogen production performance As shown in Table 3 , the ASBR operated under the thermophilic temperature of 55 °C provides a much higher optimum COD loading rate (68 kg/m3d) as compared to that of the system operated under the mesophilic temperature of 37 °C (30 kg/m3d) using upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB). Moreover, the thermophilic operation gave a much higher hydrogen production performance in terms of both hydrogen yield and SHPR than that operated under the mesophilic operation. Moreover, the COD removal, the system VFA, and the microbial washout were also higher whereas the microbial concentration was lower for the thermophilic operation than those for the mesophilic operation. The results suggest that the thermophiles are more effective than mesophilic bacteria in producing hydrogen."
14,Conclusions,"Hydrogen production from alcohol wastewater with an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor under thermophilic operation, and a controlled pH of 5.5 was investigated. At a COD loading rate of 68 kg/m3d, the system gave the best hydrogen production performance with a maximum specific hydrogen production rate of 560 ml H2/g MLVSS d and maximum hydrogen yield of 130 ml H2/g COD removed. The thermophilic operation used in this study was found to be superior to the mesophilic operation for hydrogen production. The thermophilic operation of acidogenic fermentation for hydrogen production was found to require much higher nutrient requirement than those for biogas production and for hydrogen under mesophilic temperature. The thermophiles preferentially utilize organic nitrogen more than inorganic nitrogen compounds."
