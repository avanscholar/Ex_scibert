0,Introduction,"The production of hydrogen from water using solar light energy has attracted great interest for the production of a clean, sustainable fuel that may help address the current dependence on fossil fuels. Considerable efforts have been made to develop robust hydrogen evolution catalysts for the water splitting reaction. The development of efficient electrocatalysts for proton reduction is an important step in the overall aim of developing systems for artificial photosynthesis that split H2O to produce oxygen and hydrogen. In early studies of H2 production, rhodium(III) polypyridine complexes such as [Rh(bpy)3] (bpy=2,2′-bipyridine) were capable of photochemically generating hydrogen [1,2]. In this system, the rhodium-hydride species [Rh(bpy)2H]2+ was produced via reduction of the Rh(III) complex and subsequent departure of one bipyridine ligand during the course of the reaction; [Rh(bpy)2H]2+ is likely the intermediate for hydrogen production in this process [3]. Porphyrin-rhodium complexes are also known to catalyze electrochemical generation of H2 [4]. Electrochemically reduced Rh(III) hydrides generated from rhodium(I) porphyrins react in acid to allow hydrogen evolution, but the turnover numbers via these hydrides was about 10. Some recent examples of hydrogen photoproduction were reported with Rh and Ir complexes. The Ru-Rh complex, [{(bpy)2Ru(dpp)}2RhCl2]5+ (dpp=2,3-bis(2-pyridyl)pyrazine), possesses a central Rh(III) core as a catalytic center and a Ru(III) core as a visible light collector [5]. This Rh-Ru complex was used for the photocatalytic production of hydrogen in the presence of dimethylaniline upon visible light irradiation. A two-electron mixed valence complex containing dirhodium was also used for the H2 photogeneration through a proposed dihydride-metal intermediate in the presence of hydrohalic acids [6]. Various molecular Ir and Rh catalysts have been used in the photochemical oxidation of alcohol to produce hydrogen [7]. However, examples of Rh complexes used for electrochemical hydrogen production are rare. Mononuclear Rh(III) complexes coordinated with pentamethylcyclopentadienyl (Cp*) and a bidentate ligand (e.g., bpy and phen) have often been used for electrochemical and photochemical regeneration of the natural coenzyme 1,4-dihydronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) [8–10]. In all these studies, Rh(III)-hydride intermediates were thought to be responsible for the hydride transfer to NAD+. The complex [Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+ and other derivatives were used to photochemically produce hydrogen using a TiO2 colloid [11]. Recently, we reported two different pathways for visible light-driven hydrogen production using [Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+ and formate in the presence of Pt nanoparticles [12,13]. In this study, Rh(III)-H species showed no significant activity for proton reduction, but electrons and protons associated with Rh(III)-H species were transferred to Pt nanoparticles upon visible light irradiation to produce H2. Similar Ir(III) complexes with Cp* can also generate Ir(III)-hydride species by reacting with NAD(P)H to catalyze the generation of H2 [14]. The reactivity of the (Cp*)Ir complexes was strongly dependent on the other bidentate ligands in the complex. More studies are needed to understand how the ligand environment of the metal complex influences the proton reduction reactivity of these metal-hydride species. In this study, we prepared two new (Cp*)Rh(III) complexes containing pyridyl-benzothiazole and pyridyl-benzimidazole. We performed a systematic study of proton electroreduction catalyzed by the two new rhodium catalysts at glassy carbon electrode. We demonstrated that the Rh complex of the pyridyl-benzothiazole ligand was efficient and active electrocatalytic hydrogen production catalyst in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid. The activity of this catalyst was directly compared to the activities of the Rh complexes of pyridyl-benzimidazole and bipyridine. The electrocatalytic reactivities of these complexes were also compared in acetonitrile and acetonitrile/water."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials and instrumentation,"2.1 Materials and instrumentation All reagents were purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification unless otherwise specified. Water was purified using a MilliQ purification system. [Cp*Rh(bpy)]2+ was prepared according to previously published methods [11,15]. The ligand 2-(2-pyridyl)benzimidazole (pbi) was also prepared according to a published method [16,17]. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Hewlett Packard 8453 spectrophotometer. NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Bruker 300MHz spectrometer. Electrospray ionization mass spectra (ESI–MS) were collected on a Thermo Finnigan (San Jose, CA, USA) LCQTM Advantage MAX quadrupole ion trap instrument, by infusing samples directly into the source at 25μl/min with a syringe pump. The spray voltage was set at 4.7kV and the capillary temperature at 70°C. A three-electrode cell consisting of a glassy carbon (GC) working electrode, an auxiliary platinum wire, and Ag/AgCl reference electrode was assembled for electrochemical characterization experiments. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded on a CH instrument potentiostat (CHI630C). Bulk electrolysis and coulometry were carried out using GC electrodes in CH3CN with Bu4NPF6 and in CH3CN/H2O with KNO3. A degassed solution (1ml) was first electrolyzed at −0.90V (Ag/AgCl) until the current dropped below 1mA. The catalyst (1.0mmol) was added, and electrolysis was then performed at −0.90V. The electrolysis cell constant was determined to be 2×10−4 s−1 by performing bulk electrolysis of ferrocene. The faradaic yield was periodically estimated from a volumetric measurement of the amount of gas evolved during the time needed for 10C of charge to pass through the cell. Hydrogen production was determined by gas chromatography using a DS6200 Gas chromatograph (Donam Instrument Inc., Korea) with a Carbosphere 80/100 Mesh, 6ft x 1/8” OD SS Column (Alltech, Part No.5682PC). All potentials were measured versus a saturated Ag/AgCl reference electrode (Cypress Systems, E o =195mV versus NHE). Potentiostatic electrolysis measurements were performed in a thermostated gas-tight electrochemical cell (5ml) using septa."
3,Preparation of 2-(2-pyridyl)benzothiazole (pbt),"2.2 Preparation of 2-(2-pyridyl)benzothiazole (pbt) The pbt ligand was prepared according to a reported procedure [18]. 2-Aminothiophenol (5mmol) was added to a solution of pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde (5mmol) in 20ml of methanol. The solution was refluxed for 8h. A light-yellow solid precipitated after cooling the solution to room temperature. The solid was collected by filtration and washed several times with n-hexane and then with diethyl ether. The solid was recrystallized from hot methanol, affording pale-yellow needles."
4,Preparation of [Cp*Rh(pbt)Cl](PF6) (1),"2.3 Preparation of [Cp*Rh(pbt)Cl](PF6) (1) Dichloro(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)rhodium(II) dimer (0.16mmol) in 20ml methanol was treated with 2-(2-pyridyl)benzothiazole (0.32mmol) and was stirred at room temperature. The stirring resulted in an orange-red solution which was further stirred at room temperature for about 6h and was then filtered through Celite to remove any solid residues. A saturated methanol solution of NH4BF4 (5ml) was added to the filtrate, and the solution placed in a refrigerator at 4°C to allow slow crystallization of the product. After a couple of days, a shiny crystalline product was observed, and this crystalline product was separated by filtration, washed with methanol and diethyl ether and dried in vacuo to obtain complex 1 as a red orange solid, yield 65%. X-ray quality crystals were grown by diffusion of diethyl ether into an acetonitrile solution of 1 with hexafluorophosphate at room temperature. 1H NMR (300MHz, CD3CN) 8.9 (d, 1H), 8.15-8.14 (m, 4H), 7.2-7.4 (m, 3H), 2.18 (s, 15H). ESI–MS (positive) [Rh3+ +pbt+Cp*− + Cl−]+, m/z =485.36."
5,Preparation of [Cp*Rh(pbi)Cl] (2),"2.4 Preparation of [Cp*Rh(pbi)Cl] (2) Dichloro(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)rhodium(II) dimer (0.16mmol) in 20ml of methanol was treated with 2-(2-pyridyl)benzimidazole (0.32mmol) and was stirred at room temperature. The precursor solution slowly turned to an orange-red color. The resulting solution was further stirred at room temperature for about 6h and was then filtered through Celite to remove any solid residues. Complex 2 was precipitated upon addition of diethyl ether. Complex 2 was separated by filtration, washed with methanol and diethyl ether and dried in vacuo. A yellow solid was obtained at a yield of 62%. X-ray quality crystals were grown by diffusion of diethyl ether into an acetonitrile solution of the complex at room temperature. 1H NMR (300MHz, CDCl3) 8.7–8.9 (d, 2H), 8.22–7.96 (m, 2H), 7.44–7.75 (m, 4H), 1.27 (s, 15H). ESI–MS (positive) [Rh3+ +pbi− +Cp*− +Cl− +H+]+, m/z =468.62."
6,Electrochemistry,"2.5 Electrochemistry Cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry measurements were performed with a CHI instruments potentiostat/galvanostat cycling at various scan rates, using a one-compartment cell with a glassy carbon working electrode, Pt wire auxiliary electrode and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Non-aqueous electrochemical experiments were conducted in an inert atmosphere in acetonitrile with 0.1M Bu4NPF6. Cyclic voltammograms of the ferrocene couple were measured in acetonitrile containing 0.1M Bu4NPF6 recorded on a glassy carbon working electrode with a Pt wire auxiliary electrode and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Under these conditions, the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple was found to be +0.38V vs Ag/AgCl. The half-wave potential of the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple in acetonitrile was reported to be +0.63V vs NHE. Electrochemical experiments conducted in H2O:CH3CN (1:1) were performed under an inert atmosphere in 0.1M KNO3 and were referenced to aqueous Ag/AgCl."
7,Controlled-potential electrolysis,"2.6 Controlled-potential electrolysis Controlled-potential electrolysis (CPE) was performed at −0.90V in the presence of 50mM trifluoroacetic acid and rhodium complexes in a custom built, gas-tight electrochemical cell. The electrochemical cell was purged with N2 for ∼20min before the beginning of each electrolysis experiment. Aliquots of the head-space gas were removed with a gas tight syringe following electrolysis and the amount of hydrogen was quantified by gas chromatography using a thermal conductivity detector. Faradaic efficiencies were determined by dividing the amount of hydrogen produced by the amount of hydrogen expected on the basis of charge passed during the controlled-potential electrolysis experiments."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Properties of complex 1 and 2,"3.1 Properties of complex 1 and 2 The catalysts [Cp*Rh(pbt)Cl]+ (1; Cp*=pentamethylcyclopentadiene, pbt=2-(2′-pyridyl)benzothiazole) and [Cp*Rh(pbi)Cl] (2, pbi=2-(2′-pyridyl)benzimidazole) were prepared using pbt and pbi as bidentate ligands, respectively (Fig. 1 ), according to the method previously reported for [Cp*Rh(bpy)Cl]+ [11,15]. The two nitrogens of the respective pbt and pbi were coordinated to rhodium(III) based on the crystal structures of 1 and 2. The bond distance of Rh-Npyridine (2.146Å) in 1 is similar to that of Rh-Npyridine (2.150Å) in 2 of the pbi ligand (Tables 1 and 2 ). In contrast, the bond distance of Rh-Nthiazole (2.153Å) in 1 is longer than that of Rh-Nimidazole (2.089Å) in 2. There are two reasons for this: (i) the N-H of pbi become deprotonated upon coordination to the Rh(III) center and (ii) the anionic nitrogen of the imidazole resulted in a stronger coordination bond to the metal ion. Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes were previously prepared with pbi. The amine groups of these pbi ligands were also deprotonated based on their x-crystal structures and the bond distances of Zn-Npyridine and Cd-Npyridine were also longer than Zn-Nimidazole and Cd-Nimidazole [19]. None of the secondary amine groups in these three pbi ligands were deprotonated when [Ru(pbi)3]2+ was prepared in ethanol [20]. The absorption spectrum of complex 1 in CH3CN showed absorption bands at 232nm (ε=4.35×104 M−1cm−1), 330nm (2.60×104 M−1cm−1), and 345nm (2.30×104 M−1cm−1) (Fig. 2 a). Complex 2 had absorption bands at 234nm (ε=3.80×104 M−1cm−1) and 325nm (2.25×104 M−1cm−1). The absorption bands of 1 and 2 over 300nm were red-shifted relative to those of [Cp*Rh(bpy)Cl]+ due to the coordination of pbt and pbi."
10,Electrocatalytic activities of complex 1 and 2 in acetonitrile,"3.2 Electrocatalytic activities of complex 1 and 2 in acetonitrile The electrochemical studies with complex 1 were performed in CH3CN because a number of molecular metal complexes have been reported to electrocatalytically produce hydrogen in organic solvents [21–23]. The cyclic voltammogram (CV) of 1 in a solution of 0.1M [tBu4N][PF6] in acetonitrile featured a quasi-reversible redox couple at −0.75V vs Ag/AgCl (Fig. 2b). The reductive wave at −0.75V was assigned to a Rh(III)/Rh(I) reduction event, which was similar to that observed for [Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+ [24]. Complex 2 showed irreversible couples at −0.67, −0.88, and −1.11V. The first irreversible couple was attributed to a Rh(III)/Rh(I) couple of [Cp*Rh(pbi)Cl], the second corresponded a Rh(III)/Rh(I) couple of [Cp*Rh(pbi)(H2O)]+ and the third couple was due to a reversible bpi0/− couple. Fig. 3 represents the cyclic voltammograms of complex 1 in acetonitrile with varying amounts of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The addition of TFA triggers the appearance of a irreversible cathodic wave near the Rh(III)/Rh(I) reduction couple. Increasing the TFA/1 concentration ratio increased the cathodic current of the new wave. This catalytic wave was attributed to the electrocatalytic reduction of protons by 1. Controlled potential bulk electrolysis of a solution of 0.2mM 1 in the presence of TFA in CH3CN at −0.90V (vs Ag/AgCl) was carried out on a glassy carbon electrode (Fig. 4 ). Analysis of the gas in the headspace of the electrolysis cell confirmed that the observed current enhancements corresponds to the formation of hydrogen with >90% faraday yield. This experiment was conducted in acetonitrile with 0.1M Bu4NPF6 at an operating electrolysis potential of −0.90V. Electrolysis with 0.2mM 1 and 50mM TFA was complete after 3h, and the results led to a turnover number of 72±4. No catalytic current was observed for the electrolyte alone in CH3CN until the potential was scanned up to −1.2V vs Ag/AgCl. No catalytic wave was observed when the electrolysis was carried out in the absence of 1 under the same conditions. To determine the effectiveness of the electrocatalysis in 1 and TFA, we performed a series of CV measurements under electrocatalytic conditions with a large excess of acid. As shown in Fig. S1a, the electron transfer is fast at sufficiently negative potentials. A linear correlation between ic/ip and [TFA] was observed (Fig. S1b), indicating a second order process with respect to TFA. This trend was consistent at different scan rates (Fig. S2-S3). We also found that the maximum catalytic current of 1 was dependent on the catalyst concentration (Fig. S4). These data indicate that the catalyst functions in a diffusion-controlled mass transfer regime. To assess the potential required for electrochemical production of H2 in the presence of 1, controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) experiments were performed at various applied potentials (Fig. S5). Charge buildup was monitored over the course of the CPE experiment for 1min in a 0.2mM solution of 1 in CH3CN. The total charge consumed was negligible below −0.80V and increases linearly at more negative applied potentials. Importantly, the onset of the catalytic current occurred at a potential of −0.80V (vs Ag/AgCl), which is slightly more negative than the Rh(III)/Rh(I) reduction potential. The durability of catalyst 1 was evaluated in a CPE experiment performed in CH3CN at a potential of −0.90V. As depicted in Fig. 4, catalyst 1 showed an essentially linear charge build-up with no substantial loss in activity over the course of 3h. Control experiments without 1 or TFA showed little or no activity under the same conditions. A turnover number (TON) of 72mol of H2 per mole of catalyst was obtained based on the bulk concentration of 1 (0.3mM) used in the experiment. It is important to note that only a small fraction of the Rh catalyst molecules interacted with the electrode to produce H2. Indeed, a series of 3-h CPE experiments indicated that the TON and turnover frequency (TOF) are dependent of the concentration of 1 used in the experiment, with the latter reaching a maximum value at 0.2mM 1 (Fig. S6). In addition, hydrogen production was terminated after 3h due to high concentrations of trifluoroacetate left after the hydrogen production. Trifluoroacetate would coordinate to the Rh center to deactivate the catalyst. Michaelis type kinetic behavior with 3 was observed by variation of the formate concentration, indicating a preequilibrium by formation of a complex between Rh and formate [25]. Taken together, these data establish compound 1 as an active catalyst for H2 generation from protons."
11,Dependence of catalytic rates on the outer coordination sphere,"3.3 Dependence of catalytic rates on the outer coordination sphere The largest turnover frequency for H2 was 33±3 using 1 as a catalyst in CH3CN. Under these conditions, 1 had a rate of 20μmol·h−1. The bpi complex, 2, had a turnover frequency that was much lower than that of 1 and was similar to that of the bpy complex 3 (see Fig. 5 ). This result indicates that the sulfur atom located in the outer coordination sphere of the Rh(III) complex can exert a significant influence on the catalytic rate even though it is far from the catalytic Rh site."
12,Electrocatalytic activities of complex 1 and 2 in Acetonitrile/H2O,"3.4 Electrocatalytic activities of complex 1 and 2 in Acetonitrile/H2O Electrochemical experiments were conducted in 0.1M KNO3 aqueous solutions mixed with CH3CN to explore the influence of aqueous protons on the electrocatalytic activity of catalysts 1 and 2. The cyclic voltammograms (CV) of 1 and 2 in a CH3CN and H2O (1:1) solution containing 0.1M KNO3 also featured quasi-reversible redox couples at −0.71V and −0.78 (vs Ag/AgCl, Fig. S7), respectively. Both reductive waves at −0.71V and −0.78 were assigned to a Rh(III)/Rh(I) reduction event. Cyclic voltammograms of complex 1 in CH3CN/H2O were obtained with varying amounts of TFA (Fig. 6 a). Increasing the TFA/1 concentration ratio increased the cathodic current of the new wave. This catalytic wave was attributed to the electrocatalytic reduction of protons by 1. Controlled potential bulk electrolysis of a solution of 0.2mM 1 in the presence of 50mM TFA in CH3CN/H2O at −0.90V (vs Ag/AgCl) was carried out on a glassy carbon electrode. More charge was passed during a 3h controlled potential electrolysis experiment using complex 1 than any other complexes. Analysis of the gas in the headspace of the electrolysis cell confirmed that the observed current enhancements corresponded to the formation of hydrogen with a 95% faraday yield in CH3CN/H2O due to the electrocatalytic reduction of protons. Electrolysis with 0.2mM 1 and 65mM TFA afforded a 139±5 turnover number (Fig. 6b). The turnover number was calculated according to moles of hydrogen produced/moles of the Rh catalyst. No catalytic current was observed up to −1.2V for the electrolyte alone in CH3CN. The largest turnover frequencies for H2 were also obtained using 1 (rather than 2 or 3) as a catalyst in CH3CN/H2O. Under these conditions, 1 has a rate of 40μmol·h−1, which is almost two times higher than that obtained in CH3CN under the same conditions (Fig. 6b)."
13,Mechanism and discussion,"3.5 Mechanism and discussion A two-electron reduced intermediate Rh(I) generated from 1 was protonated to form Rh(III)-H intermediates in the presence of TFA. The following rapid protonation of the Rh(III)-hydride afforded H2 and the starting Rh(III) complex. A similar mechanism was invoked in the regeneration of NADH with [Cp*Rh(bpy)Cl]+ [9,24]. The hydride transfer to NAD+ from chemically, electrochemically, and photochemically generated Rh(III)-H species has been reported elsewhere using [Cp*Rh(bpy)Cl]+ [9,13,24,26]. In the electrochemical reduction of NAD+, indirect electrochemical methods have been used to avoid high overpotentials leading to undesired side reactions during direct cathodic NAD+ reduction. The [Cp*Rh(bpy)Cl]+ complex dissolved in water was reported to convert to [Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+ [24]. As shown in Figs. 2a and S7, the number of reductive signals in CV is different due to the Rh(III)/Rh(I) couples of two species, which corresponded to the equilibrium between [Cp*Rh(pbt)Cl]+ and [Cp*Rh(pbt)(H2O)]2+ in CH3CN or CH3CN/H2O. In the case of the [Cp*Rh(pbi)Cl] complex, the similar equilibrium exists. The equilibrium constants between [Cp*Rh(pbi)Cl]+ and [Cp*Rh(pbi)(H2O)]2+ in CH3CN or CH3CN/H2O are significantly different, then two reductive waves with 2 were observed in CV in CH3CN. The pbt Rh complex had a lower redox potential than the pbi complex for the equivalent aqua complexes [Cp*Rh(pbt)(H2O)]2+ and [Cp*Rh(pbi)(H2O)]+. The equilibrium of [Cp*Rh(pbt)Cl]+/[Cp*Rh(pbt)(H2O)]2+ and [Cp*Rh(pbi)Cl]/[Cp*Rh(pbi)(H2O)]+ also affected the electrocatalytic activity of 1 and 2 in two different solvent systems. The aqua complexes [Cp*Rh(pbt)(H2O)]2+ and [Cp*Rh(pbi)(H2O)]+ were much more prevalent in CH3CN/H2O than in CH3CN. These two species of chloro- and aqua-Rh complexes should be finally converted to a Rh-H species [Cp*Rh(pbt)(H)]+ and [Cp*Rh(pbi)(H)] during the process of electrolysis. In the cases of the chloro-complexes [Cp*Rh(pbt)Cl]+ and [Cp*Rh(pbi)Cl], one more step (i.e., the substitution of Cl−) is required to generate the Rh(III)-H species. This additional process can contribute to differences in the production rate of hydrogen, as described in Figs. 5 and 6 b."
14,Conclusions,"In this study, rhodium catalysts containing pbt and pbi ligands were used to demonstrate the importance of the heterocyclic ligand in improving the catalyst performance in terms of overpotentials and rates. The pbt ligand containing sulfur significantly improved catalytic rates and turnover numbers, compared to the pbi catalyst and bpy catalyst. The turnover frequency of catalysts increased due to the presence of sulfur in the ligand, which might favor the release of H2 in the catalytic cycle. The pbt ligand also resulted in more positive catalysis potentials for the Rh(III/I) couple. The turnover number of [Cp*Rh(pbt)Cl]+ is more than twice as fast as for those of the comparable [Cp*Rh(pbi)Cl] and [Cp*Rh(bpy)Cl]+ catalyst in CH3CN. Finally, the complex [Cp*Rh(pbt)Cl]+ in CH3CN/H2O had a turnover number of 139 because of the existence of [Cp*Rh(pbt)(H2O)]2+ as a major species, compared to the reaction in CH3CN. These results suggest that the outer coordination sphere can also be used to enhance catalyst performance."
