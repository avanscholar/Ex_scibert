0,Introduction,"The selective hydrogenation of synthesis gas to oxygenates has long been known as a challenging route in synthesis gas chemistry. While methanol and Fischer–Tropsch synthesis can be considered as important industry processes, the synthesis of higher alcohols (C2+OH) still suffers from the lack of selectivity. From a practical point of view, a highly active, selective and poison-resistant catalyst for the production of mixed alcohols is highly desirable [1]. At present, molybdenum-based catalysts appear to be promising for its sulfur-resistant property [2,3]. They are made in both oxide and sulfide form, however, the form of carbide is rarely studied for mixed alcohols synthesis. Molybdenum carbide, β-Mo2C, has been shown to have excellent catalytic activity for hydrogen transfer reactions and has been suggested as a possible substitute for noble metals [4,5]. Promotion of molybdenum carbide with K2CO3 has been found to greatly enhance the selectivity to alcohols composed of linear C1–C7 [2]. It thus appears that molybdenum carbide could be a potential catalyst for alcohol synthesis. In this paper, we report our findings that the K/Fe/β-Mo2C catalyst is active in the synthesis of mixed alcohols."
1,Experimental,"The preparation of catalyst is as follows: firstly, Fe(NO3)3 ·9H2O (0.12mol/L) and (NH4)6Mo7O24 ·4H2O (0.14mol/L) aqueous solutions were prepared separately and then mixed (Fe/Mo molar ratio=1/8) under constant stirring for 2h, followed by aging, filtrating, drying, and then sample was calcined at 773K for 4h. Following grinding to a fine powder, the oxide precursor was converted to FeMo carbide via temperature programmed reaction (TPRe) using the system described elsewhere [6]. In a typical experiment, 6.0g of the FeMo oxide precursor (particle size 0.7–1.2mm) was placed in the reactor supported on a quartz wool plug. The down-flow quartz tube reactor (i.d.=0.8cm and length=40cm) was heated with an electric furnace (Lindberg, model 55031), and the reactor temperature was controlled using a programmable temperature controller (Omega, CN-2010). Then, TPRe was carried out under atmospheric pressure in a flow of CH4/4H2 gas mixture with the gas hourly space velocity of GHSV=15000h−1. The temperature was linearly increased at the rate of 60Kh−1 from room temperature to 973K, where it was maintained for 3h. Then the sample was quenched to room temperature in a flow of argon and gradually passivated with 1% O2/N2 until complete saturation of the surface. Finally, the alkalinization was carried out by physically mixed K2CO3 (K/Fe/Mo molar ratio=0.2/0.125/1) with the final carbide, which was calcined at 773K for 2h under Ar. The catalytic reactions were carried out using a stainless fixed-bed reactor with 1mL of catalyst. The products were analyzed by gas chromatographs. The mass balance was based on carbon and the error of the balance of oxygen and hydrogen was within 5%. The activity of synthesis of alcohols was expressed as space-time-yield (STY), g ROH/L-cat.h."
2,Results and discussion,"The structural and morphological properties of the prepared sample were studied by XRD, SEM analysis, respectively. The XRD pattern of the sample is shown in Fig. 1 . The diffraction indicates the definitive assignment of the β-Mo2C [7]. The β-Mo2C (2θ =34.4, 38.0, 39.4, 52.1, 61.5, 69.6, 74.6, and 75.9 for β-Mo2C [100], [002], [101], [102], [110], [103], [200], and [112], respectively) gives the hexagonal close packed (HCP) structure. Also, the Fe3C appears at the 2θ value of 44.7, and new diffraction peaks at 2θ value of 49.5 and 66.7, which may be related to the complex chemical combinations of K, Fe and β-Mo2C. “K–Fe–Mo–C” entities can also be envisaged in our case, but more studies are needed. The SEM image is shown in Fig. 2 . It can be seen that the sample shows a high homogeneity and the surface of β-Mo2C appears to be decorated by small clusters. Combined with XRD pattern of sample, small clusters may be related to K2CO3 and/or “K–Fe–Mo–C” particles. The BET surface area of the sample is only about 7.4m2 g−1, and the surface composition of the sample is K, Fe, Mo, C, and O, its atomic concentration is about 13.5%, 1.13%, 17.8%, 29.9%, and 37.5% (calculated from XPS data), respectively. It seems that Fe promoter almost inserts into the bulk of β-Mo2C and exists in the form of Fe3C and/or “K–Fe–Mo–C” particles, however, K promoter is enriched on the surface of sample. During the induction period of the reaction, the activity and selectivity for alcohol synthesis are very low, but gradually increase with time on stream and reach a steady state after about 72h. According to the literature, molybdenum-based catalysts for mixed alcohols synthesis all have an induction period during the CO hydrogenation. For molybdenum carbide, a part of the surface oxygen on the K/Fe/β-Mo2C catalyst probably reacts with carbidic carbon and is removed from the uppermost surface layer during this induction period [8]. It is also believed that during the induction, some surface carbon atoms of carbide and some deposited carbon species are eliminated [9]. The measured stable catalytic activity for alcohol synthesis after 72h is shown in Table 1 . It can be seen that for K/Fe/β-Mo2C catalyst, a high catalytic activity for alcohol synthesis is observed at this high pressure. Increasing the temperature shows that the STY of alcohol and the C2+OH/MeOH ratio is greatly improved to 264.7gL−1 h−1 and 3.79, respectively. Another feature of K/Fe/β-Mo2C catalyst is high carbon dioxide yields (∼50 C%) instead of water as a carbon monoxide product, which represents high water-gas shift activities of molybdenum carbide as frequently reported for unpromoted catalysts at atmospheric pressure [10,11]. However, in all cases the selectivity of hydrocarbons is much higher than that of alcohols. It may be attributed to the Fe3C in the catalyst, which exerts a high activity for CO hydrogenation [12]. In the present study, the high activity and selectivity for alcohols, especially for higher alcohols (C2+OH) may be due to the “K–Fe–Mo–C” active sites which are analogous to “K–Co–Mo–S” in the K/Co/MoS2 catalyst, but more studies are needed. For the optimized compositions K–Co–Mo/Al2O3 catalyst (entry 5) [13], under the condition of 10.45MPa, 28,000h−1, the STY of alcohol is higher than that of the K/Fe/β-Mo2C catalyst in entry 3, but the C2+OH/MeOH ratio is much reduced. It also should be noted that the reaction conditions for the K–Co–Mo/Al2O3 is much more severe (entry 5 vs. entry 3). Higher pressure and shorter contact time will greatly enhance the alcohol formation. The catalytic properties of K/Ni/MoS2 catalyst are also listed in the Table 1 (entry 6) [1]. Compared to the K/Ni/MoS2 catalyst, the C2+OH/MeOH ratio of K/Fe/β-Mo2C catalyst in entry 3 is reduced, whereas the STY of alcohol is much higher (entry 6 vs. entry 3) under similar conditions. It should be noted that the reaction conditions and compositions are not optimized for the K/Fe/β-Mo2C catalyst, and the K/Fe/β-Mo2C catalyst in this work is expected to perform better under appropriate conditions."
3,Conclusions,"In summary, we prepared a novel K/Fe/β-Mo2C catalyst through TPRe method, the catalyst exhibits high alcohol activity, especially high C2+OH selectivity for alcohol synthesis from CO+H2. This suggests that the prepared K/Fe/β-Mo2C catalyst is potentially a new catalytic material for mixed alcohol synthesis. Efforts of mechanistic studies are in process in our laboratory."
