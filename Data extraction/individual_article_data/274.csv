0,Introduction,"Hence the usage of environment friendly solvents are elevating in the industry, the demand for low VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) and VOC exempt solvents are replacing the conventional solvents which cause air pollution and illnesses. Acetone is a VOC exempt solvent which is widely used as a green solvent in many industries. In this regard, acetone is preferred to be produced because of the environmental advantages. The conversion of IPA (isopropyl alcohol) to acetone is an endothermic gas-phase reaction which produces hydrogen as a byproduct [1]. In literature, dehydrogenation of alcohol on metallic copper catalysts was investigated because of its practical significance in the chemical applications. Reactions of alcohols on some surfaces are of considerable attactive because they form models for the catalytic oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes and ketones [2]. Thermodynamically, the dehydrogenation reaction rate of alcohols is qualified by the hydrogen presence [3]. Copper is of basic subject to use as catalysts during the dehydrogenation of alcohols because it has importance on high selectivity for the alcohol dehydrogenation reaction; besides, catalysts due to its high copper content are required and the predominant catalyst for reactions is Cu chromite, which can include between copper as 30–50 percentages (in weight). These catalysts has high selectivity with convincing activity [4]. Investigations have also shown that zinc oxide is an significant catalyst for isopropyl alcohol dehydrogenation operation [5]. Some studies on workers exposed to acetone have not showed an important risk of spontaneous abortions up to 350 ​ppm level, but the numbers of subjects studied were too fewer to draw a definite results [6]. In literature, it was obtained that acetone was also one of five solvents included in exposure of pregnant women [7]. In exposure, it can be said for cosmetic products, paint thinners, disinfectants etc. Inhalational and transdermal exposure can be important, and children are exposed after sponge bathing. Oral absorption is rapid, with high percentages being absorbed in a short time of ingestion. The basic metabolite is acetone produced in liver by isopropanol oxidation. Children are effected from isopropanol and may reveal toxicity with much smaller ingestions [8]. An investigation found that compositions such as benzene, toluene etc. had important effects on asthma symptoms for children [9]. Nowadays, standardized approximations to rank the harm caused by various Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) reduced effects on human health [10]. Worldwide demand for acetone exceeds 6 million tons as a global performance chemical and using renewable resources, it can be obtained sustainably. While all end uses such as methyl methacrylate and bisphenol-a demands are expected to see positive growth over the years, annual growth rate of worldwide demand for acetone is predicted as 3–4% [11]. Isopropanol is known as more toxic than ethanol. It is very quickly absorbed, and approximately high percentages are metabolized to acetone, but acetone has a much longer half-life than alcohol [12]. Some studies showed that comparison of multiparametric methods for the interpretation of solvent-dependent chemical processes in detail [13]. Acetone manufacturing started with the thermal decomposition of calcium acetate or the carbohydrate fermentation of corn starch. The routes based on the cumene peroxidation or isopropyl alcohol dehydrogenation were preferred in last years with the propylene availability. Acetone is produced with phenol in the cumene route and due to its lower costs, it is the chosen technology. Acetone is obtained by this process with the percentage around 90% in the world. The manufacturing of cumene is based on the reaction of benzene and propylene in the existence of zeolite catalysts or acid based catalysts. Firstly, oxidised cumene turns into cumene hydroperoxide and the liquid phase stream subsequently cleaves in sulfuric acid intermediate to acetone and phenol. For two tonnes of phenol, 1.24 tonnes of acetone is produced for applications. In a salt existence, metal or metal oxide catalyst, dehydrogenation of isopropyl alcohol process produces acetone. In various countries, a newer process, the propylene oxidation method is being improved but it costs high amounts of capital and it is corrosive. Some amount of acetone is produced as a byproduct. Environment friendly solvents in the industry are elevating, the demand for low VOC and VOC exempt solvents are replacing the conventional solvents which cause air pollution and illnesses. Acetone is a VOC exempt solvent which is widely used as a green solvent in many industries. In this regard, acetone is preferred to be produced because of its environmental advantages and the reasonable sales price compared to its alternatives. The aim of this work was to design for 25 ​000 tons production of acetone (AC) per year by dehydrogenation of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) process for industrial applications."
1,Methodology,"The examined parameters in process were evaluated by using ChemCad simulation (Chemstations CHEMCAD 7.1). The equipments used in the process were pump, distillation column, reactor, pre-heater, heat exchanger, mixer, compressor, cooler, flash tank. Temperature, pressure, vapor fraction, enthalpy (MJ/h), IPA, AC and H2 molar flow rates (kmol/h) were studied in detail for each flow determined in simulation. Thermodynamic settings-K value model and enthalpy models were defined, and accordingly, each equipment specifications (outlet pressure, temperature of streams, calculated power, volumetric flow rate, mass flow rate) were evaluated. For the calculations, the thermal and calculation modes for the equlibrium reactor were saved. For compressor, efficiency and specific heat values were used in calculations. As a result of the process simulation, material and energy balances, efficiency of production, calculation of feed stage and overall evaluation were made for each equipment."

3,Process flow diagram for isopropyl alcohol dehydrogenation process,"3.1 Process flow diagram for isopropyl alcohol dehydrogenation process Chemcad was a significant method for chemical process simulations used in Chemical Engineering. ChemCad simulation (Chemstations CHEMCAD 7.1) [14] for the IPA dehydrogenation process was performed. Process flow diagram was drawn and the simulation run was converged (Fig. 1 ). ChemCad images were given in detail as Fig. 2 . Mass flow rates for the reactor, distillation column and mixer streams were shown in Table 1 ."
4,Initial conditions for material balances,"3.2 Initial conditions for material balances Material balances were calculated as below: Desired annual acetone production ​= ​25 ​000 tons/year 1 year ​= ​8000 ​h; Molecular mass of acetone ​= ​58,08 ​kg/kmol 25,000 tons year × 1 ​year 8000 ​h × 1,000 ​kg 1 ​tons = 3125 kg h ​Acetone 3125 kg h × 1 ​kmol 58.08 ​kg = 53.8051 kmol h ​Acetone In order to calculate the fresh feed amount, process efficiency was determined. FIPA: Fresh IPA feed stream; AIPA: IPA amount in reactor input stream; E: Reactor output stream. PAC: 99% AC product stream; RIPA: IPA amount in recycle stream; A: Amount (mass flow rate) in reactor input/output stream; RAC: AC amount in recycle stream. Initially, basis was tested as 100 ​kmol/h fresh feed in program. FIPA ​= ​100 ​kmol/h PAC ​= ​99.38926 ​kmol/h Process efficiency ​= ​PAC / FIPA ​= ​0.99389 ​= ​99.389% Desired amount of product ​= ​PAC ​= ​53.8051 ​kmol/h; 53.8051/0.99389 ​= ​54.1358 ​kmol/h Fresh IPA Feed. Temperature, pressure and enthalpy data for the streams are shown in Table 2 below. Below given tables include data such as temperature, pressure, vapor fraction, enthalpy and molar flow rates of the compounds (Table 3 )."
5,Calculation of the feed stage,"3.3 Calculation of the feed stage Kirkbride’s feed stage formula was used as a convenient empirical correlation [15,16] is in Eq. (1) as follows; (1) l o g [ N e N s ] = 0,206 ∗ l o g [ ( B D ) ( x F , H K x F , L K ) ( x B , L K x D , H K ) 2 ] Ne = Theoretical number of stages over the feed stage Ns ​= ​Theoretical number of stages under the feed stage LK (Light Key): AC HK (Heavy Key): IPA l o g [ N e N s ] = 0.206 ∗ l o g [ ( 6.145 53.805 ) ( 0.1 0.897 ) ( 0.032 0.001 ) 2 ] Ne/Ns ​= ​1.698 For a 40-stage distillation column (Eq. (2)); (2) N = 40 = N e + N s ​ = 1.698 N s + N s = 2.698 N s When Ns value was 14.826 (roughly 15 stages), Ne value was 25.174 (roughly 25 stages). For column height calculation, tray spacing was taken 0.5 ​m. Track stack was calculated as Eq. (3): (3) Tray ​stack = ( N − 1 ) ∗ 0.5 ​m = ( 40 − 1 ) ∗ 0.5 ​m = 19.5 ​m Extra feed gap, release gap (top ​+ ​bottom), platform height were assumed as 1.5 ​m, 3 ​m, 1.5 ​m, respectively and total height was 25.5 ​m. The thermodynamics model used in the simulation determined the phase equilibrium in the process. Proper selection of thermodynamics was especially the most significant way in a process simulation. If poor thermodynamic settings were selected, the results would not lead to realistic simulation outcomes. When very high pressure was involved, an activity coefficient become less accurate for the vapor over a nonideal liquid. It means that pressure begins to have significant effect on such a system at 3–10 ​atm, generally. Therefore, an Equations of State thermodynamic model was chosen and the most common EOS thermodynamic model was SRK (Soave-Redlich-Kwong). As indicated in literature, when evaluated both chemically and thermodynamically, dehydrogenation was an significant reaction that afforded unsaturated compounds and produced molecular hydrogen [17]. In accordance with the literature, due to the high costs and low selectivity associated with the production of propylene, new routes for its synthesis were being sought. Therefore, dehydration was generally studied in this field and here, the importance of optimization work emerged [18]. For this purpose, the nanocomposite catalysts were prepared by precipitation route. The conversion of isopropanol to acetone was achieved in a conventional fixed bed flow type reactor. The results showed high conversion and selectivity values to acetone [19]. Another studies in literature supported that acetone was converted to isopropyl alcohol (IPA) by selective hydrogenation with catalysts [20–23]. For the optimization process, the process simulated in this work, has the aim to maximize the process efficiency and minimize the loss of the end product. Initially, some amount of acetone was observed in the gas phase hydrogen which was carried out from the flash tank. In order to lower that amount, a better flash separation was aimed. In order to provide less acetone vaporization, the idea of changing the temperature and pressure levels at the entering stream of the flash tank, was considered. With the help of two heat exchangers and a compressor, the temperature was reduced to 5 ​°C and the pressure was increased to 12 ​bar. This modification has led the flash separation to lose much lower acetone from the gas phase stream and the hydrogen obtained from this stream, could be compressed into high pressure (200–800 ​bars) cylinders in order to commercialize the hydrogen by-product. Considering as the chance for industrial application of the offered membrane process, the process could be preferred as a side process of isopropanol production in order to increase the revenue. The greatest advantage of this process was that there was no chemical waste production during any stage of the operation. Due to the increasing demand for hydrogen, an additional H2 compression process could be considered in order to prevent a financially valuable material from being purged to the atmosphere. As above mentioned, the revenue potential of the process had to be increased as it could only be considered as a side process of IPA production from phenol. The main purpose of this study was to simulate an environmentally friendly solvent production process by producing acetone as a non VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) and low MIR (Maximum Incremental Reactivity) solvent and with no chemical waste generation. With the increasing demand, some of the new capacities are based on no acetone routes. Acetone’s global demand will continue to rise as a whole while all end uses are expected to see positive growth over the years. To support production capacity, a simple profit margin analysis was given below approximately. Total expenditure consisted of raw material expenses and catalyst expenses. Total revenue consisted of product revenues. Profit was calculated by subtracting the expenditure from the revenue. Raw material expenses were approximately obtained as below: When IPA costed as 720 USD/tonne, 54.1358 ​kmol/h equaled to 3253.345 ​kg/h and 3253.345 ​kg/h ∗ (1 tonne/1000 ​kg) ∗ (8000 ​h/1 year) ∗ 720 USD/tonne ​= ​18 ​739 ​267.2 USD per year Catalyst expenses were approximately costed as below: When copper chromite for process was 2500 USD/tonne, the calculation was 0.463 ​m3/month ∗ 4500 ​kg/m3 ​= ​2083.5 ​kg per month and 2083.5 ​kg/month ∗ (12 month/1 year) ∗ (1 tonne/1000 ​kg) ∗ 2500 USD/tonne ​= ​62 ​505 USD per year. Total Expenditure approximately was obtained as below: 18 ​739 ​267.2 USD/year ​+ ​62 ​505 USD/year ​= ​18 ​801 ​772.2 USD/year Product revenue was calculated as below: When H2 was 1670 USD per tonne, 53.4 ​kmol/h ​= ​137.8834 ​kg/h and 137.8834 ​kg/h ∗ (1 tonne/1000 ​kg) ∗ (8000 ​h/1 year) ∗ 1670 USD per tonne ​= ​1 ​842 ​122.224 USD/year For acetone, when the cost was 650 USD per tonne and 53.8051 ​kmol/h ​= ​3115.455 ​kg/h. 3115.455 ​kg/h ∗ (1 tonne/1000 ​kg) ∗ (8000 ​h/1 year) ∗ 690 USD/tonne ​= ​17 ​197 ​311.6 USD per year Total revenue was stated as: 17 ​197 ​311.6 USD/year ​+ ​1 ​842 ​122.224 USD/year ​= ​19 ​039 ​433.824 USD per year Total profit was calculated as below: 19 ​039 ​433.824 USD/year - 18 ​801 ​772.2 USD/year ​= ​237 ​661.624 USD per year"
6,Conclusion,"In this paper, the goal was to improve the production process of an environment friendly solvent to pursue the consumption of non-VOC and low maximum incremental reactivity solvents. The process simulated was maximized the process efficiency and minimized the loss of end product. Initially, some amount of acetone was observed in gas phase hydrogen. The idea of changing the temperature and pressure levels at the entering stream of flash tank was considered to provide less acetone vaporization. With the help of two heat exchangers and a compressor, the temperature was reduced to 5 ​°C and pressure was increased to 12 ​bar. This modification has led the flash separation to lose much lower acetone from the gas phase stream. Acetone production from IPA dehydrogenation process provided high purity acetone and gaseous hydrogen. The greatest advantage of the process was that there was no chemical waste production during any stage of the operation. For a greener and sustainable future, environment friendly chemicals should be chosen and the high toxicity chemicals should be avoided. Further improvements for the process may be considered in terms of energy economy and cost saving matters."
