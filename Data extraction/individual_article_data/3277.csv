0,Introduction,"Massive annual output of waste daily newspaper reached almost five million tons in China. Current recycling processes for this waste (e.g. farm incineration, burial or disposal in landfills) have caused serious environmental issues and prompted great interest on clean energy recycling method. In recent years, thermal conversion process such as pyrolysis applied to those wastes for bio-fuels production attracted great attention due to the increasing bio-energy demands and growing environmental pollution caused by the fossil fuels (Mohan et al., 2006; Yanik et al., 2007). Almost all biomass can be converted into bio-fuels (e.g. bio-gas, bio-oil, or bio-char) via pyrolysis. Previous studies have showed that fast pyrolysis process (heating rate >1000°Cs−1) has potential for converting the lignocellulosic biomass into carbon neutral fuel and intermediates (Pattiya, 2011; Wang et al., 2012). This process could produce bio-oil with high yield (65–75wt.%) Liu et al., 2014 and high energy density which are four to seven times as compared to the overall energy density of the biomass alone (Kanaujia et al., 2014). However, fast pyrolysis of biomass alone produced highly oxygenated compounds in its derived bio-oil due to high oxygen content in the feedstock, resulting in many unstable properties when it used as bio-fuel (Oasmaa et al., 2015). For example, carbonyl compounds in bio-oil cause instability and corrosion in engines; the components with high molecular weight in bio-oil result in high viscosity. Moreover, extremely low content of hydrocarbons and high water content in bio-oil lead to low heating value (Sundqvist et al., 2016). Those shortcomings greatly limited its application on fuel area used in standard engines. Previous studies have demonstrated that bio-oil derived from biomass was upgraded into drop-in bio-fuel via catalytic cracking or hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) Liu et al., 2014; Wan and Wang, 2014. Both of the two upgrading processes lead to the removal of most oxygen (more than 90wt.%) in the feedstock and favor the production of diesel and gasoline range fuels. However, the catalyst deactivation has greatly limited the application of those two upgrading process (Choudhary and Phillips, 2011). Moreover, the process of hydrodeoxygenation is highly hydrogen intensive and easy to form the compounds with high molecular weight and coke (Mercader et al., 2011). In recent years, co-pyrolysis of biomass (e.g. lignocellulosic biomass and its components) with hydrogen-rich synthetic polymers was considered as an effective way to enhance the bio-oil yield and its fuel properties (Rutkowski, 2011; Brebu and Spiridon, 2011; Abnisa et al., 2013; Cornelissen et al., 2008). The content of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in the feedstock are re-adjusted resulting in positive synergistic effects on its derived products. However, the interaction mechanism during fast co-pyrolysis is largely unknown due to the presence of series of competing reactions. Moreover, the effect of fast co-pyrolysis on the yield of bio-fuel intermediates, especially alcohols and hydrocarbons, is also unclear. Previous studies have showed that cellulose gives higher liquid yield in comparison to lignin and lignocellulosic biomass since lignin mainly produced solid products during fast pyrolysis. Especially, Brebu et al. (2010), Brebu and Spiridon (2012) reported that co-pyrolysis of lignin with four synthetic polymers only gave the liquid product yields of 53.2–62.7wt.% and also found that the liquid product yields from co-pyrolysis of pine cone with synthetic polymers reached 63.9–69.7wt.%, while the highest liquid product yield of 79.5wt.% was observed from co-pyrolysis of cellulose with polyethylene in Solak’s study (Solak and Rutkowski, 2014a, 2014b). Moreover, our previous study has demonstrated that slow co-pyrolysis of waste newspaper (WP) with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) can enhance the yield of liquid product by 31.59% and significantly improve its fuel properties (Chen et al., 2016). Therefore, waste newspaper which mainly consists of cellulose was selected in the present study in order to enhance the liquid product yield. HDPE was selected as hydrogen donor owing to its broad sources, low price, and high relative hydrogen content. Co-pyrolysis of WP with HDPE was carried out using pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), aiming at producing high yield of bio-fuel intermediates. The effects of feed ratio and temperature on co-pyrolysis derived products, especially alcohols and hydrocarbons, were evaluated. Such understanding is essential for effective utilization of wastes and development of its application in fuel area."
1,Material and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The feedstock used in this study contained WP and HDPE. WP was collected from local newsstand in Nanjing city. HDPE was supplied by Yangzi (Nanjing) Chemical Plastic CO., Ltd. Both of the two materials were first milled by a grinder then sieved into a particle size of less than 150μm using a mesh screen. Then the treated WP and HDPE were mixed at the WP:HDPE mass feed ratio of 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, 0:100 and rolled by a blender for 12h to avoid the dispersion effect of newspaper, and then dried for 8h at 80°C in order to avoid softening of HDPE. For the analysis of different pyrolysis temperature, all mixed samples are obtained from the same rolled batch. Some typical properties of the feedstock were presented in Table 1 ."
3,Fast pyrolysis procedure,"2.2 Fast pyrolysis procedure Fast co-pyrolysis of WP with HDPE was performed in a pyrolyser, CDS pyroprobe® 5200 model. Approximately 0.5mg of the sample was placed in the quartz tube for each experiment. Then the sample was subjected to fast pyrolysis at a heating rate of 20°Cms−1 and the final temperature (500°C, 600°C, 700°C, 800°C) was hold for 50s. The pyrolysis vapors released from quartz tube flowed into an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph (GC) coupled with 5975 inert XL mass selective detector (MSD) instrument via the carrier gas of high-purity helium (99.999%) at a constant flow rate of 1.0mL/min. A capillary column named HP5-MS (30m×0.25mm×0.25μm, 5%-phenyl-95%-methyl polysiloxane) was used for GC separation. The GC/MS program is: ionization energy, 70eV; injector temperature, 240°C; split ratio, 50:1; m/z range, 35–500amu, volume of injected sample, 0.2μL; initial column temperature, 40°C, hold for 2min; heating rate, 12°C/min; final temperature, 260°C, hold for 10min. carrier gas, high-purity helium of 99.999%, 1mL/min. Each experiment was repeated thrice and only their average values were used for discussion."
4,Products analysis,"2.3 Products analysis Most of the chromatographic peaks were identified based on the NIST library, and some were referred to the Wiley library and previous literatures (Brebu and Spiridon, 2011; Abnisa et al., 2013). Char yield was calculated using a high accuracy microbalance. Then quantitative analysis was performed for those compounds. Theoretical value was defined via the additivity rule calculated from the products yield corresponding to the individual components as seen in Eq. (1) (Xu and Huang, 2010). (1) y = x 1 · w 1 + x 2 · w 2 where y represents the theoretical value; x represents the experimental products yield from individual WP and HDPE pyrolysis; w is the mass proportion of WP and HDPE in the feedstock. Aliphatic hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons derived from fast co-pyrolysis were denoted as ALH and ARH, respectively."
5,Condensable oil analysis,"2.4 Condensable oil analysis A fluidized bed reactor was applied for fast co-pyrolysis of WP and HDPE. The reactor and collector diagram and its specification were referred to previous study (Kim et al., 2014). The reactor equipment was composed by a feeder, an injection auger, and a stainless steel reactor (height of 0.34m, inner diameter of 38.1mm). Silica sand (average diameter of 520μm) was selected for heat carrier in the reactor and N2 was used as the sweep gas. The feed ratio of the feedstock was 50g/h and the estimated residence time of the released vapor was 1.2s. The reactor was heated indirectly by electricity to a pyrolysis temperature of 600°C. A pipe which connects reactor and collector was preheated to 350°C in order to avoid the condensation of pyrolysis gas during the experiments. Oil derived from fast pyrolysis was recovered from electrostatic precipitator (organic phase with high molecular-weight compounds) and condenser (aqueous phase with low molecular-weight compounds) which are located downstream of the rector. Oils in the present study referred to the sum of the condensable liquid products obtained from those two collectors. Water content in aqueous phase was determined by a Karl-Fischer Titrator (KEM, MKS-500) with Hydranal-composite 5K solution, while water content in organic phase was measured by a Mettler Toledo Thermogravimetry/Differential Scanning Calorimetry system (TGA/DSC). During the TGA/DSC experiment, organic phase was heated from room temperature up to 103°C under the heating rate of 10°/C min, and hold the final temperature for 50min. Water content in oil is determined based on the water content in aqueous phase and organic phase and their respective yields. Physical properties of derived oils were determined in items of ultimate composition using Carlo Erba EA1108, calorific value using IKA C-2000, total acid number and pH using Mettler Toledo T50, density using Antor-Paar DMA35N, and viscosity using Brookfield LVDV-E according to ASTM E203-96. Only averaged values over thrice repeated test were used for discussion."
6,Result and discussion,
7,Products distribution of fast pyrolysis of WP and HDPE,"3.1 Products distribution of fast pyrolysis of WP and HDPE Fig. 1 shows the composition of products derived from fast pyrolysis of individual feedstock at 500°C, 600°C, 700°C, and 800°C. From Fig. 1, it can be observed that fast pyrolysis of WP gives mainly oxygenated compounds (e.g., aldehydes, ketones, furans, anhydrosugars, phenols, ethers, and alcohols) which were the typical pyrolysates from the degradation of cellulose. It should be noted that the yield of alcohols is extremely low (1.71%) from fast pyrolysis of WP at 500°C and no hydrocarbons were observed. However, the yields of alcohols and hydrocarbons were obviously increased with the rising temperature and reached the highest alcohols yield of 17.08% at 700°C and the highest hydrocarbons yield (ALH of 43.26% and ARH of 6.6%) at 800°C. This fact is related to the deoxygenation at higher temperature favoring the formation of hydrocarbons and the dehydration reaction by the β-scission of a tertiary carbon radical in any of the first to fifth position in the WP structure generating hydroxyl radicals and favoring the formation of alcohols (Shen and Gu, 2009). The ARH was observed at high temperature in the WP derived vapors and its yield reached the maximum of 6.6% at 800°C, which is attributed to the 1,6-cyclization reaction of linear hydrocarbon end-chain radicals forming aromatics (Vinu and Broadbelt, 2012). Those facts indicated that fast pyrolysis of WP alone need high energy consumption to produce high yield of alcohols and hydrocarbons. The products derived from fast pyrolysis of HDPE contained only hydrocarbons (most linear ALH, less cyclic ALH and ARH), which were formed from random scissions of the original polymer chains in HDPE structure. It can be observed that the yields of cyclic ALH and ARH reached the maximum of 9.56% and 8.56%, respectively, at 800°C, implying that higher temperature favors the cyclization reaction leading to the formation of cyclic ALH and ARH."
8,Products distribution of fast co-pyrolysis of WP and HDPE,"3.2 Products distribution of fast co-pyrolysis of WP and HDPE 3.2.1 Effect of feed ratio Fig. 2 depicts the effect of feed ratio on products distribution from fast co-pyrolysis at 500°C by comparing the experimental products yield with theoretical value. It can be observed that fast co-pyrolysis of WP with HDPE produces hydrocarbons as its major products and alcohols as major interaction pyrolysates. Anhydrosugars, aldehydes, ketones, furans, acids, esters, and ethers were also observed in its derived products. It can be concluded that the experimental anhydrosugars, aldehydes, ketones, and furans are lower than that of theoretical data, especially ketones, while the experimental yields of alcohols and hydrocarbons were obviously higher as compared to theoretical data. This result indicates that WP and HDPE derived compounds may be involved in the interactions during co-pyrolysis resulting in the formation of alcohols and hydrocarbons. Those interaction effects may be attributed to the deoxygenation caused by HDPE favoring the formation of hydrocarbons during co-pyrolysis and the dehydration reaction by the β-scission of a tertiary carbon radical in any of the first to fifth position in the WP structure generating hydroxyl radicals and favoring the formation of alcohols (Shen and Gu, 2009). A clear decreasing tendency of char yields was observed with the HDPE proportion increased in the feedstock. This fact is attributed to the crack effect of HDPE resulting in lower WP-derived char yield. Marin et al. (2002) reported that pyrolysis of polymers generates free radicals which involved in the interactions with biomass-derived char, favoring the decomposition of biomass and leading to lower char yield. However, it can be concluded that the experimental char yields of all WP/HDPE blends are higher than that of the theoretical data, while our previous study (Chen et al., 2016) showed that slow co-pyrolysis of WP with HDPE results in a significant decrease in char yield. Those two opposite results may be related to the hydrocarbon vapors released from fast pyrolysis of HDPE which involved in the reaction with biomass-derived char produced from WP leading to the formation of condensed ring aromatic compounds that are retained in the char after pyrolysis (Ojha and Vinu, 2015). This observation under fast co-pyrolysis is also in good agreement with Suriapparao’s study (Suriapparao et al., 2014). 3.2.2 Effect of temperature Fig. 3 shows the effect of temperature on products distribution from fast co-pyrolysis at the feed ratio of 50:50wt.% by comparing the experimental products yield with theoretical value. It is evident that the ALH yield was first increased and then decreased with the rising temperature. This fact is related to the high value of activation energy at high temperatures, which favors the end-chain fission and β-scission reactions for long-chain hydrocarbons leading to its conversion to non-condensable hydrocarbons (C1-C3) Kruse et al., 2003. The same variation trend was observed for experimental yield of ALH as compared to theoretical data. Moreover, the experimental yield of aldehydes and ketones exhibit a significant decreasing trend in comparison to theoretical data. Those facts suggest that aldehydes and ketones are indeed involved in the interactions during co-pyrolysis leading to the generation of alcohols and ALH. It should be noted that a significantly decrease for experimental yield of alcohols and ALH was observed at 800°C, while the experimental yield of ARH and phenols was increased significantly. Those results can be related to the reactions of 1,6-cyclization, β-scission, and hydrogen abstraction. Hydrogen abstraction reaction and β-scission for end-chain of long-chain hydrocarbons results in the formation of C2–C6 alkenes (Kruse et al., 2003; Ranzi et al., 2001), then those alkenes favor the formation of benzene ring via 1, 6-cyclization at high temperature (Dean et al., 2013). Moreover, radicals in ALH end-chain derived from HDPE with alcohols fragments, carboxylic acids, and carbonyl can lead to the formation of phenols. It can be concluded from Fig. 3 that experimental yield of alcohols was significantly higher than that of theoretical data at 500–700°C, while it was decreased at 800°C and lower than theoretical data by 280%. This fact can be also attributed to the formation of phenols at high temperature. Regarding the yield of furans, the experimental yields are higher than that of theoretical data at 600–700°C, indicating that higher temperature favor the ring closing reaction of sugars followed by dehydration reactions (Zhou et al., 2014). No furans were observed at 800°C, which may be related to the increase in the yield of ARH. 3.2.3 Interactions mechanism during fast co-pyrolysis It is common that hydrocarbons with proper carbon number are valuable as diesel or gasoline range compounds and bio-oil with high yield of alcohols and hydrocarbons can be subjected to further catalytic hydrodeoxygenation with possibly low hydrogen load. Fast co-pyrolysis of WP with HDPE at feed ratio of 50:50wt.% and 600°C was particularly analyzed in order to investigate the interactions mechanism, since it gives the maximum sum yield of alcohols and hydrocarbons of 85.88%. Fig. 4 depicts the PY-GC/MS chromatograms of vapors derived from fast pyrolysis of WP, HDPE, and their blend (WP:HDPE feed ratio of 50:50wt.%) at 600°C. Moreover, the identified products derived from individual feedstock and the main interaction products were marked and listed in Fig. 4. It is evident that pyrolysis of HDPE alone only produced diene, alkene, and alkane with linear chain (C10-C23), while linear and branched hydrocarbons with carbon number range of C6-C10 were observed in co-pyrolysis derived vapors. This fact may be related to the free radicals generated from thermal degradation of WP which involved in the secondary crack reactions for HDPE initial products leading to the formation of linear hydrocarbons with lower carbon number. For example, fast pyrolysis of individual HDPE shows high relative abundance of cetene (C16) in chromatograms, while a significant decrease in the relative abundance of this compound was observed in the chromatograms of co-pyrolysis of WP with HDPE. The formation of 1-heptene (C7) and 1-nonene (C9) in co-pyrolysis vapor may have been responsible for this fact owing to the secondary crack of cetene (C16) as depicted in Fig. 5 . Simultaneously, the effects of hydrogen supplements and deoxidation by HDPE result in the conversion of aldehyde/ketones (glyoxal, methyl glyoxal and methyl vinyl ketone) derived from WP into hydrocarbons and subsequently fragments recombination favoring the formation of branched hydrocarbons as presented in Fig. 5. Obviously decline in the content of aldehyde/ketones during co-pyrolysis (concluded from Fig. 2) was an evidence for this result. Interaction products of alcohols with linear long chains were observed in co-pyrolysis vapors. Fig. 6 shows that hydrocarbons with activated radical site from random scissions of the original polymer chains in HDPE structure were involved in the interactions with hydroxyl fragments from initial cellulose degradation in WP structure resulting in the formation of interaction alcohols with linear long chain."
9,Quality of derived oils,"3.3 Quality of derived oils In order to probe the quality of oils derived from fast pyrolysis and investigate its possible application in fuel area, physical properties and element components of derived oils were determined and compared to that of commercial diesel No. 0 (Martinez et al., 2014). The results were presented in Table 2 . It is clear that co-pyrolysis demonstrated strong deoxidation effect on its derived oil, showing a decrease in the content of oxygen in comparison to WP derived oil. This fact is directly attributed to the dramatically decline in the content of water and oxygen-containing organic compounds in co-pyrolysis oil, which significantly improved the instability and corrosion of oil obtained from WP pyrolysis alone when it was used as liquid fuel. High calorific value of co-pyrolysis oil was achieved and even was close to that of commercial diesel No. 0, which leads to higher substantial thermal efficiency and power outputs when it applied in modified internal combustion engines (Yang et al., 2013). It should be noted that high hydrocarbon yield and low water content in co-pyrolysis oil lead to high H/C atomic ratio which has been responsible for the obviously increase in high calorific value (Shadangi and Mohanty, 2013). Physical properties of co-pyrolysis oil were obviously upgraded demonstrating a lower total acid value, density, and viscosity, while higher pH as compared to WP derived oil. Even though co-pyrolysis gives the strong upgrading effect on physical properties of its derived oil and even those properties are close to commercial diesel No. 0, further upgrading process should be carried out in co-pyrolysis oil for its application in standard engines as liquid fuel. For example, total acid number lower than 10 is accepted for avoiding corrosiveness problems and deposit formation (Martinez et al., 2014), while its value in co-pyrolysis oil reached 17.8–24.5 (WP:HDPE mass feed rate of 50:50). Moreover, water in co-pyrolysis oil may leads to flame extinction in internal-combustion engine (Yang et al., 2013). It also should be noted that the high yields of alcohols, hydrocarbons and H/C atomic ratio indicated that the co-pyrolysis oil can be subjected to further catalytic hydrodeoxygenation with possibly low hydrogen load (Ojha and Vinu, 2015). Those facts demonstrated that fast co-pyrolysis of WP with HDPE is a promising upstream process to improve the quality of its derived oil without any catalyzer."
10,Conclusions,"Fast co-pyrolysis gives the maximum yields of alcohols and hydrocarbons to 85.88% at feed ratio of 50:50wt.% and 600°C. Hydrogen supplements and deoxidation by HDPE and subsequently fragments recombination lead to the formation of branched hydrocarbons. Radicals from WP degradation favor the secondary crack for HDPE products resulting in the formation of linear hydrocarbons with low carbon number. Hydrocarbons with activated radical site from HDPE degradation were interacted with hydroxyl from WP degradation promoting the formation of linear long chain alcohols. Moreover, quality of condensable oil was upgraded via co-pyrolysis and was even close to commercial diesel No. 0."
