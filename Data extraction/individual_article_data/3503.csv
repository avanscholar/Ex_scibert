0,Introduction,"Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), as powerful devices for the conversion of solar energy, contribute to alleviating the energy crisis and environmental pollution issue caused by the use of traditional fossil fuels [1–4]. A typical DSSC consists of an N719 dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode, an electrolyte containing I3 -/I- redox couples, and a platinum (Pt) counter electrode (CE). However, the I3 -/I- electrolyte is easily quite volatile, easily corrodes Pt CE, and has a high overpotential for dye regeneration [5–7]. The N719 dye has a limited molar extinction coefficient, which makes it difficult to obtain high open-circuit voltage (V oc) [8,9]. These shortcomings greatly affect the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. To overcome the shortcomings of traditional DSSCs, new redox couples and dyes have been developed for optimizing DSSCs. The copper redox couple (Cu2+/Cu+) has many merits, such as no corrosion to the electrode, no absorption of visible light, slow electron recombination rate, and ultra-high photovoltage [10–14]. Organic chromophore sensitizers (like D35 and Y123) have superior molar extinction coefficients [9,15]. Therefore, the Cu2+/Cu+ redox couple and the D35/Y123 dye were proposed to replace the I3 -/I- redox couples and the N719 dye, respectively, which can enhance the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. Apart from the redox couples and dyes, the CE catalyst is another critical part of the DSSC, which plays an essential role in catalyzing the reduction of I3 - or Cu2+ in the electrolyte and collecting electrons from the external circuit [16–19]. Pt is recognized as the preferred CE catalyst; however, Pt is less effective in advanced DSSCs with I-free redox couples [20–24]. Therefore, the development of a Pt-free CE catalyst that matches the Cu redox couples and new dyes is critical for advanced DSSCs. Water splitting is an effective method for hydrogen production. In this process, an outstanding cathode catalyst with superior catalytic activity and conductivity accelerates water splitting to produce hydrogen via the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [25–29]. The properties of the cathode catalysts greatly affect the efficiency of hydrogen production. Pt-based catalysts are also the commonly used catalysts for the HER, whereas Pt-based catalysts are scarce and expensive. Therefore, the development of low-cost and high-activity Pt-free catalysts is also urgent for the HER. In the past 30 years, several catalysts (carbon materials, conductive polymers, transition metal compound, metal and alloys, hybrids, etc.,) have been developed [30–34], yielding Pt-free catalysts for DSSCs and the HER. Of them, bimetallic oxides are outstanding owing to their superior electrocatalytic activities and stabilities [35–37]. Ma et al. synthesized a NiCo2O4 catalyst for catalyzing triiodide in DSSC, and the cell obtained an efficiency of 5.20% [38]. Wang et al. prepared a CoMoO4 nanosheet array, which exhibited superior catalytic activity for HER [39]. Kang et al. synthesized a flower-shaped CoMn2O4 for HER, which yielded a small overpotential of 132 mV [40]. Undisputedly, bimetallic oxides exhibit high catalytic activities for DSSCs and the HER. Unfortunately, bimetallic oxide nanoparticles exhibit inferior electron conductivity and serious nanoparticle agglomeration, thus resulting in the catalytic activity failing to exceed Pt [41–45]. Carbon materials exhibit superior electrical conductivity and catalytic properties, owing to their special electron structure and specific surface area [46–48]. Therefore, combining the merits of the electrical conductivity of carbon materials and the outstanding electrocatalytic ability of bimetallic oxides into one composite will yield the desired catalytic properties. Based on this strategy, Ahmed et al. loaded NiWO4 onto the rGO to synthesize the rGO/NiWO4 composite, which displayed enhanced activity for HER [49]. Yu et al. hybridized CoFe2O4 and graphene to form a composite as a CE catalyst in DSSC, and produced a more excellent efficiency of 9.04% [50]. Lin et al. synthesized a NiCo2O4/carbon black composite, which exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity for I3 - reduction in traditional DSSC than that of NiCo2O4 and carbon black alone [51]. Indeed, coupling the merits of the electrical conductivity of carbon materials and the outstanding electrocatalytic ability of bimetallic oxides can boost the catalytic activity of the catalyst. Impressively, the recent reports have illustrated that bio-based carbon is an outstanding carbon substrate because of its abundance of resources, low cost, high catalytic activity, and rich pore structure after activation [52,53]. The introduced carbon substrate reduces bimetallic oxide nanoparticle aggregation, resulting in exposure to more active sites, thus enhancing the catalytic properties of these catalysts [54,55]. Tantalum (Ta)-based monometallic components (TaOx, Ta3N5, and Ta4C3) and bimetallic oxides (FeTa2O6, CuTa2O6, and CoTa2O6) have been demonstrated to have excellent electrocatalytic abilities in DSSCs with I3 -/I- redox couples [56,57]. In this regard, hybrids of bio-based carbon and Ta-based bimetallic oxides have great potential for preparing outstanding catalysts to replace Pt for boosting Cu2+ reduction in advanced DSSCs with D35 and Y123 dye and hydrogen production. In this work, a low-cost aloe peel-derived bio-based carbon (MPC) with mesh-like porous structure was synthesized, and a highly active Ta-based bimetallic oxide of MnTa2O6 was prepared using a facile co-precipitation method. The MnTa2O6@MPC hybrid was further synthesized by integrating the merits of MnTa2O6 and MPC in one hybrid and used as a catalyst for the advanced DSSC and HER. To the best of our knowledge, only a few researches have used bio-based carbon hybridization with bimetallic oxides to boost the catalytic activity of catalysts for DSSC and HER."
1,Experimental section,"Aloe peel was collected from an aloe beverage factory in Yangling, Shaanxi, China. Tantalum chloride (TaCl5, 99.9% purity) was purchased from Alfa Aesar Chemical Co., Ltd. Manganese nitrate tetrahydrate (Mn(NO3)2·4H2O, 98% purity) was obtained from Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd. Potassium hydroxide (KOH, AR) was got from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Ammonia solution (NH3·H2O, AR) was acquired from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All chemicals are commercially available."
2,Synthesis of MnTa2O6 and MnTa2O6@Mesh-like porous carbon,"2.1 Synthesis of MnTa2O6 and MnTa2O6@Mesh-like porous carbon The MnTa2O6@Mesh-like porous carbon hybrid was synthesized by a facile co-precipitation method. The synthesis process of MnTa2O6 and MnTa2O6@MPC is briefly illustrated in Fig. 1a. The aloe peel powders were added to the deionized (DI) water to form an aqueous mixture. Subsequently, this mixture went through the hydrothermal process and KOH activation to yield activated carbon. Finally, the mesh-like bio-based porous carbon (MPC) was obtained after pyrolysis of activated carbon. More details can be indexed in our previous works [58,59]. 0.251 g of Mn(NO3)2·4H2O, 0.716 g of TaCl5, and 0.048 g of MPC were dispersed in ethanol and stirred vigorously until the solution was thoroughly mixed. Subsequently, ammonium hydroxide was added dropwise to adjust the pH to be neutral. The resultant precipitates were collected, washed, dried, and pyrolyzed at the condition of 1000 °C for 6 h under nitrogen flow to obtain the target product of MnTa2O6@MPC. For comparing the advantages of as-obtained material, pure MnTa2O6 was prepared by the same process without adding MPC. The as-synthesized MnTa2O6 and MnTa2O6@MPC are used as CE catalysts for fabricating DSSCs, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1b."
3,Fabrication of the electrodes and DSSCs,"2.2 Fabrication of the electrodes and DSSCs Fabrication of CEs: 200 mg of catalysts (MPC, MnTa2O6, and MnTa2O6@MPC) were dispersed in 4 mL of isopropanol with ZrO2 pearls (dispersion medium), respectively, and stirred to form a uniform suspension. Next, the suspension was spray-coated on an FTO glass substrate by using an air-brush and treated for 30 min (400 °C) under N2 gas protection. Pt CE for comparison was prepared by annealing the FTO substrate loaded with chloroplatinic acid at 450 °C in air condition [60,61]. The purchased TiO2 photoanode (12 µm, Jiangsu Yanchang Sunlaite Group, China) with an active area of 0.196 cm2 was sintered at 400 °C in the air for 30 min and then cooled to 120 ℃. The obtained TiO2 film was rapidly immersed into the 0.2 mM solution of D35 dye in an ethanol solution, or 0.1 mM solution of Y123 dye in a tert-butyl alcohol/acetonitrile solution (v:v = 1:1), respectively, and was placed in the dark condition for 24 h. A typical sandwich-structure solar cell was assembled by using the electrolyte, as-prepared CE, and D35 or Y123-sensitized photoanode. More details on cell fabrication were found in previous literature [62–64]. The structure of advanced Cu-mediated DSSC with D35 and Y123 dye and as-prepared CEs is shown in Fig. 1b."
4,Fabrication of work electrodes for HER,"2.3 Fabrication of work electrodes for HER The prepared catalyst (0.010 g) was dispersed in a 1 mL DI water-ethanol mixture (4:1, v/v) containing 25 μL Nafion (Macklin, 5 wt%). Then, it was ultrasonically dispersed for 30 min. Subsequently, a working electrode was fabricated by loading 75 μL of catalyst ink on nickel foam (NF) and drying at room temperature [65,66]."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization Structural and morphological characterization: The nanostructure and surface morphology of as-synthesized catalysts were detected through an X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD, D/Max 2200, MDI, USA) and a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JSM-6700F, JEOL, Japan), respectively. The BET surface and pore structure of MnTa2O6@MPC were recorded by N2 adsorption-desorption measurements (Quadrasorb SI, at 77 K, America). Cell measurements: The photocurrent density-voltage (J-V) curve was evaluated under 100 mW cm− 2 light condition by a solar simulator (Oriel 94023A, Newport, USA) and a Keithley 2400 digital source meter. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization tests were performed by CHI 660E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, Shanghai, China) with symmetrical cells. The EIS measurements were performed at an AC amplitude of 10 mV and frequencies from 0.1 to 105 Hz. The obtained EIS data were fitted by the Z-view software. The electrolyte for J-V, EIS, and Tafel test consisted of 0.2 M [Cu(dmp)2]+TFSI, 0.04 M [Cu(dmp)2]2+(TFSI)2 (TFSI: bis (trifluoromethane) sulfonamide), 0.6 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), and 0.1 M LiTFSI in acetonitrile solution. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) test was carried out by CHI 660E electrochemical at the potential of 0.4–1 V in acetonitrile solution composed of 5 mM [Cu(dmp)2]+TFSI and 0.1 M LiTFSI. HER measurements: Linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) was examined by using a three-electrode system at a scan rate of 5 mV/s in 1 M KOH solution with a potential (−1.4 to −0.8 V). In this three-electrode system (Fig. 1b), a graphite rod was regard as CE, the as-obtained electrode as working electrode, and a Mercury/Mercury Oxide (Hg/HgO) rod as the reference electrode. The Tafel slope curve was estimated according to the equation ( η = blog j + a , where η stands for the overpotential, j represents the current density, and b symbolizes the Tafel slope) [67]. The EIS was performed at an overpotential of 180 mV vs. Hg/HgO in the frequency range of 0.1 to 105 Hz. The double-layer capacitance (C dl) was obtained by using CV measurement in the voltage region (−0.05 to 0.05 V) vs. Hg/HgO at different scan rates (0.01–0.2 V/s). The potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale according to the Nernst equation of E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. Hg/HgO) +0.059 pH +0.098."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Structural and morphological characterizations,"3.1 Structural and morphological characterizations Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of as-prepared MPC, MnTa2O6, and MnTa2O6@MPC catalysts. A broad diffraction peak at 24.3° was observed in the pattern of the MPC, which belonged to the (002) plane of typical graphitic carbon, indicating the as-prepared MPC possesses a disordered turbostratic structure. Similar results were found in previous reports [59,68,69]. The diffraction peaks of MnTa2O6 and MnTa2O6@MPC matched with the JCPDS: 72–0485 card, and the peaks located at 12.26, 24.10, 29.90, 35.29, 35.85, 51.26, 52.35, 52.76, 60.05, and 63.77°, which are corresponded to (200), (310), (311), (002), (021), (330), (602), (621), (313), and (023) crystal planes, respectively. This result demonstrates that MnTa2O6 and MnTa2O6@MPC with an orthorhombic crystal structure are successfully synthesized. The surface morphologies of MPC, MnTa2O6, and MnTa2O6@MPC are detected via FESEM, as shown in Fig. 2b-d. The MPC showed the distinctive mesh-like carbon skeleton and a hierarchical porous structure with the pore size ranging from 50 nanometers to 2 micrometers. These pore structures could provide fast channels for electrolyte diffusion, and the pore edge could provide rich active sites for catalyzing Cu2+ reduction. In Fig. 2d, after the MPC was introduced and combined with the MnTa2O6 particles to form a hybrid, the Mn2TaO6 nanoparticles became evenly distributed on the MPC skeleton surface or embedded into the pore structure, and the agglomeration of the MnTa2O6 particles was significantly reduced. This result is beneficial for sufficiently exposing the active sites, thus improving the catalytic activity of the catalyst. In Fig. 3a, MnTa2O6@MPC showed typical IV adsorption-desorption isotherms with H4 hysteresis loops, indicating that mesoporous structure is predominant in this catalyst. Moreover, hybrid MnTa2O6@MPC exhibited a high BET special surface area of 332.743 m2 g−1 and a total pore volume of 0.10 m3 g−1, which will provide rich active sites for catalyzing Cu2+ reduction and HER. As shown in Fig. 3b, the pore width of MnTa2O6@MPC are located at 3.42, 7.43, and 100 nm, indicating exist mesoporous (2–50 nm) and macropore (>50 nm) structure. This rich pore structure offers convenient paths for mass transmission, thus boosting the catalytic activity of the catalyst."
8,Cu2+ reduction in advanced DSSCs,"3.2 Cu2+ reduction in advanced DSSCs Fig. 4a exhibits the CV curves of the as-prepared MPC, MnTa2O6, and MnTa2O6@MPC catalysts, and corresponding parameters are listed in Table 1. A pair of redox peaks were observed in the CV curves, demonstrating the superior catalytic activities of these catalysts for Cu2+ reduction. In addition, the reduction peak current density (I p) and separation between oxidation peak and reduction peak (ΔE p) are two essential indicators for assessing the catalytic activity of the catalyst. A small ΔE p and a large I p indicate a high catalytic activity of the catalyst. By combining MPC and MnTa2O6 to form MnTa2O6@MPC, the I p values (Fig. 4b) increased while the ΔE p values decreased (Fig. 4c), indicating that the catalytic activity of MnTa2O6@MPC increased. Moreover, MnTa2O6@MPC presented a larger I p (−0.215 mA cm−2) and a smaller ΔE p (0.097 V) as compared with Pt, indicating that the MnTa2O6@MPC catalyst had higher catalytic activity than Pt for Cu2+ reduction. EIS measurements were performed to confirm the charge transport mechanism in Cu2+ reduction process. The Nyquist plots are presented in Fig. 4d by Z-view software fitting and the detailed values are tabulated in Table 1. The intersection point of the first semicircle and the X-axis is specified as the series resistance (R s), and the radius of the left semicircle is defined as the charge transfer resistance (R ct) [70–73]. The R s represents the adhesion between the FTO substrate and catalyst, while the R ct represents the charge transfer resistance in the catalyst/electrolyte interface. The MPC had a large R s value (17.33 Ω cm2), indicating a poor adhesion to FTO conductive bases. To improve the poor adhesion of the FTO substrate and electrode films, several strategies have been proposed [74–76]. MnTa2O6 and MPC exhibited large R ct values of 60.2 and 5.92 Ω cm2, respectively, implying the inferior charge transport at the interface between the catalyst and Cu-medium electrolyte. Encouragingly, the R ct value decreased remarkably to 1.60 Ω cm2 after combining MnTa2O6 and MPC to form one hybrid. This result may be attributed to the following: 1) MPC skeleton has a large surface and rich pore structure, which provides effective electron transport paths, and thus boosts the Cu2+ reduction in the electrolyte; 2) MnTa2O6 improves the poor adhesion of MPC and reduces the series resistance between the catalyst film and FTO substrate. Similar findings have been reported previously [1,77]. Fig. 4e shows the Tafel polarization curves of as-prepared MPC, MnTa2O6, and MnTa2O6@MPC catalysts toward Cu2+/Cu+ redox mediator. The exchange current density (J 0) and the limiting diffusion current density (J lim), as critical values describing the electrochemical properties of CE catalysts, were acquired from the Tafel curves. A steep gradient of cathode branch of a Tafel curve means a large J 0 and a high catalytic activity of the catalyst [55,78,79]. The MnTa2O6@MPC exhibited the largest J 0 value as compared with MnTa2O6, MPC, and Pt CEs, displaying its topmost catalytic activity for Cu2+ reduction. Moreover, J 0 varies inversely with R ct. The MnTa2O6@MPC has a large J 0 value, indicating a small R ct. The Tafel results agreed with the EIS results. Moreover, as shown in Eq. (1), J lim has a positive relationship with diffusion coefficient (D n). MnTa2O6@MPC also presented the highest J lim value in these catalysts, which indicates that MnTa2O6@MPC possesses the fastest redox electrolyte diffusion in the electrolyte. (1) D n = l J lim 2 nFC where n represents the number of electrons, C is Cu2+ concentration in the redox electrolyte, F stands for Faraday constant, l means the spacer thickness and D n is the diffusion coefficient. Fig. 5a-b show the J-V curves of the Cu-mediated DSSCs with the as-prepared CE catalysts matching the D35 and Y123 dyes, respectively. The obtained photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 2. Clearly, solar cells with Pt, MPC, MnTa2O6, and MnTa2O6@MPC CEs in the Cu2+/Cu+ electrolyte and sensitized with the D35 dye exhibit high V oc values (~0.88 V), higher than those for the traditional I-/I3 - electrolyte [80]. The enhanced V oc was attributed to the Cu-mediated electrolyte having more positive and easily tunable redox potentials [81–85]. MnTa2O6@MPC exhibits an excellent PCE of 3.41% with a short-circuit current density (J sc) of 6.85 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 56.32%, higher than those of Pt (PCE = 2.93%, J sc = 5.94 mA cm−2, and FF = 56.15%), MPC (PCE = 2.42%, J sc = 6.56 mA cm−2, and FF = 40.40%), and MnTa2O6 (PCE = 1.33%, J sc = 5.27 mA cm−2, and FF = 28.78%). These results demonstrate that MnTa2O6@MPC has higher matching and catalytic performance than Pt for Cu2+ reduction in advanced DSSCs with D35 and Y123 dyes. In order to explore the reasons why MnTa2O6@MPC exhibited enhanced catalytic activity for Cu2+ reduction, the relation between the PCE and R ct was analyzed in Fig. 5c. The PCEs of DSSCs with D35 dye are higher than those of DSSCs with Y123 dye. In addition, the R ct values decreased and PCE values increased after hybridization of MPC and MnTa2O6 to form MnTa2O6@MPC. These results demonstrate that a low R ct results in a high PCE, and bridging MnTa2O6 and MPC in one catalyst can boost the catalytic activity. Similar results were found in previous works [36,57,86]. The detailed reasons are illustrated in Fig. 5d. In the MnTa2O6@MPC hybrid, the MPC with three-dimensional mesh-like porous structures not only increased the contact between the CE and the electrolyte, but also provided fast transmission paths for electron transmission, as well as suppressed the aggregation of MnTa2O6 nanoparticles. In addition, MnTa2O6 nanoparticles in the hybrid improved the poor adhesion of MPC and provided rich catalytic activity sites for Cu2+ reduction. As a result, the hybrid of MnTa2O6@MPC endows a superior photovoltaic performance. In order to exclude the influence of extrinsic factors on data reliability, the photovoltaic parameters of PCE, J sc, V oc, and FF were achieved by testing 10 cells. As displayed in Fig. 6a-d, the data points of V oc, J sc, FF, and PCE were highly concentrated, indicating that the obtained parameters were reliable. In addition, the values of V oc and J sc of DSSCs with the D35 sensitizer were higher than those of the Y123 sensitizer, which resulted in a higher PCE. After the above-mentioned measurements, it is confirmed that MnTa2O6@MPC has superior catalytic activity for Cu2+ reduction. To further survey the application potential of MnTa2O6@MPC catalyst, the reaction kinetics, stability, and photoresponse capability were also investigated. In Fig. 7a, upon increasing the scan rate from 5 to 20 mV/s, the positions of the oxidation and reduction peaks gradually expanded outward. In addition, in Fig. 7b, the square root of scan rates and the peak current density exhibited a linear relationship. These results indicate that the catalytic reduction is restrained by the diffusion of Cu2+/Cu+ redox couples. Similar results were found in previous works [30,87]. Fig. 7c-d display the photoresponse capability of devices based on MnTa2O6@MPC CE. In devices with D35 and Y123 dyes, the photocurrent abruptly increased under light irradiation (100 mW cm−2) and suddenly decreased to zero when the “switch” was off (0 mW cm−2). This phenomenon demonstrates the superior catalytic activity of MnTa2O6@MPC for Cu2+ reduction, and the outstanding photoresponse capability of the device with MnTa2O6@MPC CE. Fig. 7e shows the 50 cycles of continuous CV scanning of MnTa2O6@MPC. The CV curves showed an excellent overlap, and the corresponding peak current density has no obvious change, as shown in Fig. 7f, indicating that as-prepared MnTa2O6@MPC CE possesses high stability in Cu2+/Cu+ electrolyte. Table 3 summarizes the reported DSSC performance based on the Cu2+/Cu+ redox couples that matched different dyes and CEs. It is easy to find that the photovoltaic performance of advanced DSSCs with the Cu2+/Cu+ electrolyte can be affected by many factors. For example, for the same Cu2+/Cu+ redox couples matching different ligands [10,14] or for the same electrolyte but matching different dyes and CEs [8,12,13], DSSCs yield different photovoltaic performances. The advanced Cu-based DSSCs exhibit excellent potential (PCE reached 11.8%), while matching between different cell components (electrolyte, dye, and CE) is still a barrier for further enhancing the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. In this work, the DSSC with MnTa2O6@MPC CE matching D35 dye obtained a PCE of 3.14%, which is higher than or close to that of DSSCs with Pt CE, matched with LEG4, G3, and N719 dyes [10,11,14,88]. When using the same redox couples ([Cu(dmp)2]2+/+) and dye (D35), the DSSC with PEDOT CE yielded a PCE of 9.22%, which was higher than that of MnTa2O6@MPC (3.41%) [89]. This means that MnTa2O6 is inferior to PEDOT in matching the Cu2+/Cu+ electrolyte for advanced DSSCs, which provides guidance for designing high-performance CE catalysts for advanced DSSCs with Cu-based electrolytes and D35 and/or Y123 dyes."
9,HER catalytic performance,"3.3 HER catalytic performance An outstanding catalyst usually possesses the multifunctional catalytic ability for different catalytic activities [91–95]. To further explore the catalytic potential of as-prepared catalysts, the HER catalytic performance was assessed by using a three-electrode system in the 1.0 M KOH solution. Fig. 8a exhibits the LSV curves of NF, Pt/C, MnTa2O6, MPC, and MnTa2O6@MPC. The overpotential (η 10) at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 is usually adopted to assess the catalytic activity of catalysts, and a low η 10 means a high catalytic activity [96–99]. The detailed η 10 of various catalysts are displayed in Fig. 8c. To further investigate the HER kinetics process, the Tafel polarization curve was obtained by fitting the line part of LSV curves, and the results are plotted in Fig. 8b. Generally, a small Tafel slope represents a fast HER reaction kinetics [100–102]. The Tafel slope of MnTa2O6@MPC (105.0 mV dec−1) was lesser than that of MnTa2O6 (130.9 mV dec−1), MPC (140.3 mV dec−1), and NF (156.2 mV dec-1), demonstrating that MnTa2O6@MPC possesses superior reaction kinetics. As shown in Fig. 8c, η 10 values are in the order of NF (256.6 mV)> MPC (192.8 mV)> MnTa2O6 (175.8 mV)> MnTa2O6@MPC (141.9 mV)> Pt/C (50.6 mV), indicating that the catalytic activity of MnTa2O6@MPC was higher than that of MnTa2O6 and MPC. In addition, with a decrease in η 10, the Tafel slope also decreases, further demonstrating that the catalytic activity of MnTa2O6@MPC increased after hybridizing the MPC and MnTa2O6 in one catalyst. The increased HER catalytic activity may be attributed to the following reasons: 1) MPC provides rich ion transmission paths and enhances the conductivity of the catalyst, thus accelerating the transport of HER-related species; 2) MnTa2O6 provides abundant active sites and induces a synergetic effect between MPC and MnTa2O6, thus boosting the HER activity. Fig. 8d displays the EIS results of as-prepared catalysts for HER in alkaline solution. All the Nyquist plots of the catalysts exhibit a clear semicircle, and the diameter of each semicircle is defined as R ct, which reflects the electrode kinetics at the electrode catalyst||electrolyte interface [103,104]. The R ct value of MnTa2O6@MPC is smaller than those for MPC and MnTa2O6, indicating that hybridizing MPC and MnTa2O6 can reduce the interfacial charge transfer resistance. The EIS results are in a good agreement with the LSV and Tafel results, demonstrating the superior electrochemical properties of MnTa2O6@MPC. The stability of the catalysts is a key parameter for their large-scale application. Herein, the stability of MnTa2O6@MPC was explored through 1000 CV polarization curve tests and CP measurements. In Fig. 9a-c, after 1000 cycles, the LSV curves of MnTa2O6, MPC, and MnTa2O6@MPC did not exhibit any obvious change compared with the initial one. In addition, in Fig. 9d, the CP curves of as-prepared three catalysts are almost a horizontal line after 10,000 s. These results demonstrate that as-prepared MnTa2O6, MPC, and MnTa2O6@MPC have superior stability in the 1.0 M KOH solution. Electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) is typically used for assessing the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of a catalyst. However, the ECSA cannot be measured directly, and it is estimated using the double-layer capacitance (C dl), which is proportional to the ECSA [105]. To obtain C dl, CV measurements were carried out, and the results are displayed in Fig. 10a-c. Based on the CV curves, C dl can be determined by plotting Δj (Δj = (janodic−jcathodic)/2) at 0 V vs. Hg/HgO and the scan rate. The linear slope of the plot yields the C dl value of the corresponding catalyst. In Fig. 10d, MnTa2O6@MPC exhibited a C dl of 4.35 mF cm−2, which is superior to those of MnTa2O6 (2.96 mF cm−2) and MPC (2.31 mF cm−2), implying that MnTa2O6@MPC exhibited the highest catalytic activity for the HER. This result is attributed to the fact that MnTa2O6@MPC combines the merits of the high catalytic activity of MnTa2O6 and outstanding electronic conductivity of MPC, reducing the reaction overpotential and boosting the charge transfer at the catalyst||electrolyte interface."
10,Conclusion,"In summary, the MnTa2O6 catalyst was successfully synthesized using an effective co-precipitation method. Aloe peel-derived mesh-like bio-based porous carbon (MPC) was introduced into the MnTa2O6 catalyst to form a MnTa2O6@MPC hybrid to enhance its catalytic activity. The obtained MnTa2O6@MPC demonstrated excellent bifunctional catalytic activity in DSSCs and HER. The Cu-mediated DSSCs based on the MnTa2O6@MPC CE, assembled with D35 and Y123 dyes, achieved a V oc of ~0.88 V, and outstanding cell efficiencies of 3.41% and 1.92%, which are respectively 16% and 8% higher than that of Pt. MnTa2O6@MPC also produced a low η 10 value of 141.9 mV and a small Tafel slope of 105.0 mV dec−1 in an alkaline HER. MnTa2O6@MPC exhibited superior compatibility and stability in Cu-mediated DSSCs with D35 and Y123 dyes and the HER. Further work will focus on the matching and stability of Cu-mediated DSSCs with various redox couples and various CE catalysts."
