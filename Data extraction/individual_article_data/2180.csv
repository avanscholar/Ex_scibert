0,Introduction,"The food supply is a complex and dynamic chain that faces some significant challenges due to the complexity of processing, changes in consumer needs and behavior, implementation of new laws and regulations, and matters related to safety (Ebrahimi Tirtashi et al., 2019). There is an urgent need to develop bio-based smart packaging that can convey information about the food condition, such as the freshness of the food. The definition of intelligent material is a substance that monitors the environmental conditions of the commodity and informs consumers of the food and its surrounding environment (Kuswandi & Nurfawaidi, 2017). Customers can rapidly differentiate between fresh and spoiled food without needing to open the packaging, which can contribute to better food quality and less food waste (Yam, Takhistov, & Miltz, 2005). One kind of freshness indicator is acid-base indicator, also known as pH indicator, whose color is affected by the pH value of the environment in which it is used (Ezati, Tajik, & Moradi, 2019). In the process of protein decomposition in meat, a large number of volatile alkaline substances (such as dimethylamine, trimethylamine and ammonia) will be produced, which will result in the alkaline atmosphere of packaging top space (Merz et al., 2020). Traditionally, synthetic compounds are used as indicators, but these compounds are not edible, and contact with food may pose a risk to consumers due to their possible toxicity, which limits their use in monitoring food quality (Ma & Wang, 2016). Therefore, finding natural and food-grade pH indicators is essential for the development of food intelligent packaging systems. Many researchers are focusing on anthocyanins derived from natural plants. Anthocyanins are highly responsive to pH changes, which makes anthocyanin-rich films to monitor the quality of packaged foods. Notably, the color change of the anthocyanin-rich solution is closely related to the source and composition of the anthocyanin (Yong & Liu, 2020). Many previous studies have shown that the rose is rich in anthocyanins, and its anthocyanins have significant anti-oxidant, anti-cancer and anti-allergic effects (Ge & Ma, 2013; Lee, Lee, & Choung, 2011). Due to its excellent pH sensitivity, Kang et al. (2020) studied the film based on polyvinyl alcohol/okra mucous polysaccharide combined with rose anthocyanin to monitor the freshness of shrimp. In order to fix anthocyanins, many biodegradable polymers have been reported, including chitosan, starch, cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), gelatin, etc. Because of their excellent film-forming properties and their ability as carriers of active ingredients, such as antioxidants, antibacterial agents and pH indicator pigments, cellulose and its derivatives are widely used in the production of food packaging films (Ezati, Priyadarshi, Bang, & Rhim, 2021). Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-Na) is a linear and water-soluble cellulose ether that is attractive to positive and negative charges (Liu, Cui, Shang, & Zhong, 2021). PVA is a vinyl polymer that is non-toxic and has good mechanical properties (Mallakpour & Motirasoul, 2017). In this work, we aimed to develop a pH-responsive film based on CMC-Na/PVA (CPVA) containing rose anthocyanin extracts (RAEs) for monitoring pork freshness. The effects of different concentrations of RAEs on the physicochemical properties of the CPVA film were studied and analyzed. Then the antioxidant activity of the RAEs-CPVA film was also evaluated. Finally, the potential of RAEs-CPVA film in monitoring the spoilage process of pork at 25 ℃ was explored based on its response to pH."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals and material,"2.1 Chemicals and material Freeze-dried Pingyin roses were obtained from Shandong Huamei biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Jinan, Shandong, China). Fresh pork was purchased from Auchan supermarket near our university (Wuxi, China). AB-8 macroporous adsorption resin was purchased from Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). CMC-Na (Mw, 90000), 2,2′-Azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) and 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Missouri, USA). Others were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and all of them were analytical reagent."
3,"Extraction, purification and characterization of RAEs","2.2 Extraction, purification and characterization of RAEs 1 g rose pollen was added to 50 mL 70 % (V/V) ethanol containing 1% HCl, and extracted at 25 °C for 30 min. Then the extract was centrifuged at 6153 g/min for 10 min, and the obtained supernatant was filtered for later use. Then the filtrate was purified on the column of AB-8 macroporous resin, which was continuously eluted with 70 % (V/V) ethanol containing HCl (pH 3). The filtrate was collected, lyophilized after rotary evaporation, and stored at 4 °C until use. The analysis of high-performance liquid chromatography-mass was based on the method of Ge and Ma (2013), and was slightly modified."
4,Color and spectral properties of RAEs solutions in various pH ranges,"2.3 Color and spectral properties of RAEs solutions in various pH ranges Buffers with pH 1–14 were prepared with 0.1 mol/L citric acid solution and 0.2 mol/L Na2HCO3 solution (the solution of pH 1 and pH 9–14) can be adjusted by adding a little dilute HCl and NaOH solutions). The 4.0 mg RAEs was dissolved in 10 mL of the above buffer to make the final concentration 0.4 mg/mL, respectively. The color of solution was observed and photographed. Then the solution under various pH conditions was scanned at wavelengths ranging from 400 to 700 nm, and the changes of absorption wavelength were recorded (Kang et al., 2020)."
5,Preparation of RAEs-CPVA films,"2.4 Preparation of RAEs-CPVA films The RAEs-CPVA films indicator films were prepared via a casting process according to the method of Liu et al. (2021), and the preparation schematic diagram was shown in Fig. 1 . 8.0 g PVA (average degree of polymerization, 1750 ± 50) was poured into 100 mL of deionized water and stirred at 90 °C to a transparent liquid. 2.0 g CMC-Na was poured into 100 mL of deionized water and stirred at 75 °C to a transparent liquid. Then PVA solution and the CMC-Na solution were mixed at a ratio of 1:1 (v/v) at 70 °C and continued to stir until homogeneous liquids. A certain quality of RAEs powder was dissolved in a small amount of deionized water and then slowly added dropwise to the stirring mixture with a pipette gun to the final concentration of 0, 40, 80 and 160 mg/100 mL. The solution continued to be stirred for 30 min to completely disperse the RAEs solution in the hydrogel. Finally, 10 mL of the film-forming solution was poured into a 90 mm petri dish and dried in an oven at 40 °C to form a film. The prepared film were named CPVA film, 40-RAEs-CPVA film, 80-RAEs-CPVA film and 160-RAES-CPVA film, respectively."
6,Physicochemical properties of RAEs-CPVA films,"2.5 Physicochemical properties of RAEs-CPVA films 2.5.1 Physical appearance and color The prepared film samples were laid flat on white paper and photographed, and the color parameters of L*, a*, b* and ΔE of the film were obtained using a colorimeter (Merz et al., 2020). 2.5.2 Thickness The thickness of the films were measured at 10 randomly selected points with a spiral micrometer (Shanghai Shenhan Measuring Tool Co., Ltd., China) (Merz et al., 2020). 2.5.3 Light transmittance and opacity According to the method determined by Zhang et al. (2020), an UV–visible spectrophotometer (UV 1800, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) was used to measure light barrier property of the films. Opacity of the film was obtained by referring to the method of Sun et al. (2020). 2.5.4 Moisture content (MC), swelling index (SI) and water solubility (WS) M1 (g) film samples were put into an oven at 105 ℃ and dried to a constant weight of M2 (g) (Yong et al., 2019b). Then dried samples were put into 20 mL deionized water and soak them for 24 h. Next, film samples were taken out and wiped the moisture on the surface to obtain the swelled mass M3 (g). Finally, the swelled samples were dried to a constant weight of M4 (g) by using the oven (Sani, Tavassoli, Hamishehkar, & McClements, 2021). WC, SI and WS were calculated according to the following formula: (1) M C % = M 1 - M 2 M 1 × 100 (2) S I ( % ) = M 3 - M 2 M 2 × 100 (3) W S % = M 1 - M 4 M 1 × 100 2.5.5 Water vapor permeability (WVP) The WVP of the film samples were determined according to Zhang et al. (2020) gravimetric analysis method. The centrifuge tubes (50 mL, d = 3 cm) containing a certain mass of dry silica gel were sealed with film samples. Then the test tubes were placed in a desiccator with deionized water (100% relative humidity) at 25 °C. The weight gain of the test tubes were continuously determined for 8 d."
7,Structural characterization of RAEs-CPVA films,"2.6 Structural characterization of RAEs-CPVA films 2.6.1 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis RAEs was measured by KBr tablet method with an FTIR spectrometer (IS10, Thermo Nicolet Corporation, America) in the 4000–800 cm−1 range, and measurement of the films spectrums were carried out in the attenuated total reflection (ATR) mode (Qin et al., 2020b). 2.6.2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis XRD analysis of the RAEs and film samples were performed on diffractometer (D2 PHASER, German Bruker AXS Co., Ltd., Germany) with a reference target of Cu kα radiation. Detailed parameters were as follows: scanning range, 2-80° (2θ angle); step size, 0.05°/S; voltage, 30 kV; current, 10 mA (Kang et al., 2020). 2.6.3 Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) analysis Surface microscopic photographs of dried RAE were obtained at 3.0 kV and 300 × magnification using a FE-SEM (SU8100, Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Japan). Before the test, the samples were frozen with liquid nitrogen, and then brittle fracture samples were obtained (Alizadeh-Sani et al., 2021)."
8,Antioxidant activity of RAEs-CPVA films,"2.7 Antioxidant activity of RAEs-CPVA films The films sample was taken 1 × 2 cm2 and placed in centrifuge tubes containing 5 mL of deionized water. Then centrifuge tubes were placed in the oscillator and oscillated at 150 rpm/min for 2 h. After centrifugation, the supernatant was taken for later use. The scavenging ability of the films samples to DPPH free radicals and ABTS free radicals was determined according to the previously reported method (Barbosa et al., 2020; Teng et al., 2021)."
9,160-RAEs-CPVA film’ response to pH changes,"2.8 160-RAEs-CPVA film’ response to pH changes The films sample was cut into small square pieces and then immersed in a buffer solution (pH 1–14). After being completely immersed, the small square pieces were immediately taken out and placed on the filter paper (Zhang, Huang, Yan, Hu, & Ren, 2020). After 10 min, their color changes were observed and photographed."
10,Trials on monitoring the pork freshness,"2.9 Trials on monitoring the pork freshness 50 g of fresh pork (almost pure lean meat) was placed in a plastic crisper (9.5 × 7 × 3 cm3) with an initial total viable count of ∼ 3.79 log CFU/g. The 160-RAEs-CPVA film (1 × 2 cm2) was fixed in the top space of the plastic crisper to monitor the deterioration of pork. Then the plastic crisper was placed at 25 ℃ for 40 h. The film changes of 160-RAEs-CPVA and pH values of pork were recorded, and total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) values were determined by a semi-micro Kjeldahl distillation unit every 8 h (Zhang et al., 2019)."
11,Statistical analysis,2.10 Statistical analysis The data was performed in three replications and carried out the mean ± standard deviation. Statistical analysis was realized through adopting one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in SPSS (version 16.0). Significant differences were measured by the Duncan test. The results influences were considered significance (P < 0.05).
12,Results,
13,Color and spectral characteristic of RAEs in different buffer solutions,"3.1 Color and spectral characteristic of RAEs in different buffer solutions The analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry proved RAEs contained peonidin 3,5-diglucoside and cyanidin 3,5-diglucoside (Supplementary Fig. 1). The color diversity and corresponding peak shifts are caused by their structural changes (Castaneda-Ovando, Pacheco-Hernandez, Paez-Hernandez, Rodriguez, & Galan-Vidal, 2009). As shown in Fig. 2 (A), the maximum absorption wavelengths of RAEs in the pH 1–3 solution were 518–520 nm. With the increased of pH value, the absorbance value at the maximum absorption wavelength gradually decreased from 0.724 to 0.165, and the color of RAE solution changed from rose red to light pink. Because at low pH, RAEs in solution mainly existed in the red flavylium cation. With the increased of pH, the structure of flavylium cation was damaged, which further leaded to the lightening of solution color (Calderaro et al., 2020). When at pH 4–6, RAEs had no maximum absorption wavelength in the 400–700 wavelength range, and the solution was colorless, which indicated that rapid hydration of the flavylium cation occurs at C-2 to form the colorless carbinol pseudobase (Rodriguez-Amaya, 2019). In a solution with the pH of 6–10, the maximum absorption wavelengths of RAEs had a red shift from 527 nm to 594 nm. In addition, the absorbance value of RAEs solution at the maximum absorption wavelength gradually increased, and the color darkened from colorless to purple and to dark blue. At pH 10–14, the absorbance value at the 600 nm gradually decreased from 0.707 to 0.12, and the color darkened from blue to purple and to dark yellow. Because RAEs solution had pale yellow chalcone structures, purple quinone base structures and blue quinone base structures, respectively (Calderaro et al., 2020)."
14,Physicochemical properties of RAEs-CPVA films,"3.2 Physicochemical properties of RAEs-CPVA films 3.2.1 Appearance and color Color is a crucial indicator that directly reflects the appearance of the film. As shown in Fig. 2(B), the color of the CPVA film was colorless and transparent, while the color of the RAEs-CPVA film darkens as the amount of RAEs increased. Table 1 summarized the color parameters of CPVA, 40-RAEs-CPVA, 80-RAEs-CPVA and 160-RAEs-CPVA films. The a* and b* values of the RAEs-CPVA film increased with the increase of RAEs content, indicating that the RAEs-CPVA film became redder and yellower. Compared with CPVA film, the ΔE value of RAEs-CPVA film decreased significantly (P < 0.05), indicating that the color of CPVA/RAEs film was darker and more colored. 3.2.2 Thickness Film thickness is an important parameter of the film, which directly affects the mechanical strength, water vapor transmission rate, light transmittance and opacity of the film. As shown in Table 1, with the increase of the amount of RAEs, the thickness of the film increased significantly (P < 0.05) from 0.060 to 0.068 mm. It may be that the added extract increased the dry matter content of the film-forming liquid, which ultimately led to an increase in the thickness of the film (Zhang et al., 2020). In addition, a low content of RAEs can be well distributed in the film-forming liquid, while a higher content of RAEs may produce a more complex matrix, resulting in an increase in film thickness (Yong et al., 2019a). 3.2.3 Light transmittance and opacity The transparency or opacity of the film is an important optical property in many food packaging applications (Sani et al, 2021). Fig. 2(C) and Table 1 respectively presented the UV–visible light transmittance and opacity of different films. CPVA film had the highest transparency and good light transmittance in the range of 200–800 nm. However, the light transmittance of the films incorporating RAEs decreased significantly, and as the RAEs content increased, the light transmittance further decreased. It indicated that the RAEs-CPVA film had high UV–visible light blocking performance. Studies have shown that the addition of natural particles and chromophore can reduce the transparency and light transmittance of films (Alizadeh-Sani, Mohammadian, & McClements, 2020). Due to the large number of chromophiles in anthocyanins such as CC and CO, the addition of RAEs can effectively reduce the UV–visible light transmittance of the films (Qin, Liu, Zhang, & Liu, 2020a). Therefore, RAEs-CPVA film has potential applications to protect food from degradation and oxidation caused by UV–visible light. 3.2.4 MC, SI and WS MC has a certain impact on the water resistance and physical barrier of the film, and WS can be correlated with additive-polymer compatibility to help predict the integrity of the matrix with additives in the polymer system (Yoshida, Maciel, Mendonca, & Franco, 2014). As shown in Table 1, RAE content has almost no effect on WC and WS (P < 0.05). The lower WC of the RAEs-CPVA film may not limit its use as a food packaging material, because it is not prone to the growth of microorganisms on the surface of the packaged food (Rawdkuen, Faseha, Benjakul, & Kaewprachu, 2020). In addition, due to its limitations on water-based foods, higher WS for packaging is undesirable. The SI value indicates the affinity of the colorimetric film with water during storage and the effect on the color response efficiency, and high SI value means faster release of dye, which is not conducive to the color reaction of the colorimetric film (Merz et al., 2020). The SI of RAEs-CPVA film first increased and then decreased with the increase of RAEs content (P < 0.05). Our result showed that high content of RAEs was beneficial to the color reaction of RAEs-CPVA film. 3.2.5 WVP Food packaging film has the properties of preventing the transfer of water vapor between the surrounding environment and the packaged food (Yong & Liu, 2020). Therefore, WVP is an important barrier parameter reflecting the ability of the film to resist water vapor (Huang et al., 2019). It can be seen from Table 1 that the WVP values of 40-RAEs-CPVA and 80-RAEs-CPVA films were not significantly different from those of CPVA film, indicating that low-content RAEs can be well dispersed in the film system and interact with the film system (P < 0.05). The value of 160-RAEs-CPVA film was significantly higher than that of CPVA film (P < 0.05). It may be that too high RAEs accumulated in the film matrix, thereby creating more free volume and destroying the internal compactness of the film. However, studies have pointed out that the WVP of the film was also affected by its crystallinity, and water vapor was more likely to diffuse through the amorphous region of the film matrix (Yong et al., 2019a). However, our research result was that the RAEs-CPVA film with relatively low crystallinity exhibited high water vapor barrier properties, which was consistent with the results of the study by Qin et al. (2020a)."
15,Characterization of RAEs-CPVA film,"3.3 Characterization of RAEs-CPVA film 3.3.1 FTIR analysis FTIR spectra reveals valuable knowledge about molecular conformations and interactions between different components in composite films (Sani et al., 2021). Fig. 3 (A) displayed the ATR-FTIR (FTIR) spectra of RAEs, PVA, CMC-Na, CPVA film and RAEs-CPVA films. For spectra of RAEs, the broad band at 3373.63 cm−1 was assigned to OH stretching (Qin et al., 2019). Representative spectra of dried RAEs presented characteristic bands at 1037.38, 1202.31, 1448.53, 1616.69 and 1726.98 cm−1, which could be corresponded to aromatic ether = COC stretching modes, the presence of CH2, different CC stretching modes of the aromatic rings, and CO vibration of the benzopyran ring, respectively (Zeng, Xu, Yang, Zong, & Lou, 2018). In addition, the characteristic signal located at 1616.69 cm−1 also related to the stretching of aromatic ring in anthocyanins (Luchese, Abdalla, Spada, & Tessaro, 2018). CMC-Na showed characteristic bands at 1413.53 cm−1 was attributed to the asymmetric stretching of –COO–. The characteristic signal at 1585.93 cm−1 was due to the tensile vibration of CO. The broad band at 1019.79 cm−1 was related to the tensile vibration of CH in the aromatic ring skeleton. With regard to the spectra of PVA, the characteristic peak at 3273.63 cm−1 was attributed to the OH tensile vibration. The bands at 1085.28 cm−1 was assigned to the stretching vibration of CO. The bending vibration of CH-CH2 produced a characteristic peak of 1415.84 cm−1, which confirmed the carbon skeleton of PVA (Pereira, de Arruda, & Stefani, 2015). The CPVA film showed that when CMC-Na was mixed with PVA, the peak at 3273.63 cm−1 shifted to the right. It may be that the addition of PVA will affect the intermolecular force of CMC-Na, and a new hydrogen bond force is formed between PVA and CMC-Na (Liu et al., 2021). In general, the CPVA film doped with RAEs did not significantly change the spectrum of the film. It is worth noting that, compared with the CPVA film, the RAEs-CPVA film had a wider peak at 3265.95 cm−1, and the peak at 2939.35 cm−1 shifted to the right to 2909.11 cm−1. It may be due to the hydrogen bond interaction between the hydroxyl group in the RAEs and the hydrophobic groups of PVA and CMC-Na (Ma, Du, Yang, & Wang, 2017). 3.3.2 XRD analysis The crystallinity of the film is a parameter that reflects the compatibility and intermolecular interaction between different film components (Sukhija, Singh, & Riar, 2016). As shown in Fig. 3(B), the XRD pattern of RAEs showed a broad diffraction peak near 24.2° (2θ), indicating that RAEs were amorphous, which was the same as many reported results (Qin et al., 2020a). The semi-crystalline characteristics of PVA were identified from the strong diffraction peak at 19.8° (2θ) and the weak peak at 2θ° (2θ). In the CMC-Na pattern, there was a very weak broad peak near 16.9° (2θ) corresponding to its amorphous characteristics. After mixing with CMC-Na, the intensity of the diffraction peak of PVA at 19.8° (2θ) dropped sharply, indicating that the hydrogen bond formed between PVA and CMC-Na destroyed the original arrangement of PVA, resulting in a decrease in crystallinity. The crystalline properties of the anthocyanin-rich film are mainly affected by the properties of the film matrix and largely retain the original diffraction peaks of the biopolymer-based film (Yong & Liu, 2020). Similarly, the RAEs-CPVA film displayed the same diffraction peaks as the CPVA film. In addition, the diffraction peak intensity of RAEs-CPVA film was significantly higher than that of CPVA film with the increase of RAEs content, which indicated that the incorporation of RAEs increased the crystallinity of the film to some extent (Yong et al., 2019b). 3.3.3 FE-SEM analysis Fig. 3(C) presented the surface and cross-section of the CPVA film and RAEs-CPVA film. It can be seen from the Fig. 3(C) that the surface and cross-section of the CPVA film and 40-RAE-CPVA film were dense, close to smooth and have a continuous surface. With the increase of the amount of RAEs added, the surface of the 80-RAEs-CPVA film and 160-RAEs-CPVA film gradually had small bubbles, the cross section became rough, and the uniformity of the film was affected. The result was consistent with the previous results that the 40-RAEs-CPVA film had a lower water vapor transmission rate and a higher surface contact angle. The high content of RAEs may damage the network structure of the polymer and make the structure of the film looser and rougher (Zhai et al., 2017). Ma and Wang (2016) also reported that after adding grape skin anthocyanins, the cross-section of the tara gum/cellulose nanocrystal film became rougher and cracked. On the contrary, Alizadeh-Sani et al. (2021) showed that the mixed barberry anthocyanin made the methylcellulose/chitosan nanofiber film exhibit a more consistent and uniform continuous structure. In addition, the incorporation of cranberry blueberry and pomegranate anthocyanins did not significantly affect the surface of the chitosan-starch film (Lozano-Navarro et al., 2018)."
16,Antioxidant analysis of RAEs-CPVA films,"3.4 Antioxidant analysis of RAEs-CPVA films Fig. 4 (A) presented the antioxidant capacity of CPVA film with and without RAEs. As expected, CPVA film had no antioxidant activity against DPPH and ABTS free radicals. On the contrary, with the increase of RAEs’ concentration, RAEs-CPVA film showed strong DPPH (65.74–83.80%) and ABTS scavenging ability (20.57–57.86%). It may be due to the strong antioxidant activity of the OH group in RAEs (Sani et al., 2021). Notably, the ability of RAEs-CPVA film to scavenge DPPH was significantly better than that of ABTS. At present, many studies have reported that the addition of anthocyanin extract improved the DPPH scavenging ability of film, which is consistent with our research results (Sun et al., 2020; Yong et al., 2019b). Thus, RAEs-CPVA film had the potential as an active film packaging system that protected food from free radical-induced oxidation."
17,160-RAEs-CPVA film’ response to pH changes,"3.5 160-RAEs-CPVA film’ response to pH changes pH sensitivity is one of the important evaluation indicators for smart packaging. As shown in Fig. 4(B), 160-RAEs-CPVA film presented different colors with the change of pH. The color change trend of 160-RAEs-CPVA film was dark red to pink (pH 1- pH 4), close to colorless (pH 5- pH 6), gray (pH 7- pH 8), light green to dark green (pH 9- pH 12), orange-yellow (pH 13-pH 14). Notably, the color of 160-RAEs-CPVA film was not completely consistent with the color change of the RAEs solution. Because the intermolecular interaction between anthocyanins and biopolymers can restrict anthocyanins from changing their structure (Yong & Liu, 2020)."
18,Applications of 160-RAEs-CPVA film in pork spoilage monitoring,"3.6 Applications of 160-RAEs-CPVA film in pork spoilage monitoring The spoilage of meat is mainly due to the degradation of protein by the action of microorganisms and enzymes, and protein degradation will lead to the formation of high levels of TVB-N, the formation of volatile nitrogen-containing compounds, thereby increasing the pH value in the package (Sani et al., 2021). Considering the pH responsiveness of 160-RAEs-CPVA films, these films can be used to monitor the freshness of pork. As shown in Table 2 , the initial TVB-N value of fresh pork was 4.60 mg/100 g. As the storage time increased from 0 h to 16 h, the TVB-N value of pork increased 9.85 mg/100 g, and the color of 160-RAEs-CPVA film gradually changed to light-green. During this process, the color of the pork became dark red with a slight peculiar smell, indicating that the pork was fresher at this time. After 16 h of storage, the TVB-N value of pork further increased from 18.31 mg/100 g (24 h) to 33.93 mg/100 g (40 h), and the color of the 160-RAEs-CPVA film changed to green to orange-green to orange. During this process, the surface of the pork gradually became sticky and green, and has a foul smell, indicating that the pork had changed from being stale to severely spoiled. Notably, during 0–8 h, the pH of pork decreased from 6.15 to 5.84, which was due to the decomposition of lactic acid and adenosine triphosphate from muscle glycolysis and phosphoric acid from muscle glycolysis in pork during rigidity stage (Li, Tang, Shen, & Dong, 2019). After 8 h of storage, the pH value of pork gradually increased from 6.02 to 6.93 because of the alkaline volatile nitrogen compounds produced after the pork began to degenerate. Therefore, the freshness of pork can be identified by the color change of 160-RAEs-CPVA film."
19,Conclusion,"We developed an active and indicator film based on CPVA containing RAEs. FTIR revealed that the hydroxyl groups in RAEs and the hydrophilic groups of CPVA form hydrogen bond interactions and have good compatibility. Studies have shown that the amount of RAEs added affected the physicochemical properties and structure of RAEs-CPVA film. The increase in the concentration of RAEs darkened the color, decreased the transparency, and increased the thickness of the RAEs-CPVA film, but had no significant effect on the water content, water solubility and hydrophilicity. Interestingly, we found that the effect of RAEs on the water vapor transmission rate of RAEs-CPVA membranes was related to its crystallinity. More importantly, 160-RAEs-CPVA film had strong antioxidant capacity, which the antioxidant capacity to DPPH was stronger than that to ABTS. In addition, the monitoring of pork freshness during storage at 25 °C showed obvious color changes. Therefore, our research on RAEs-CPVA film may provide new insights for the development of active and smart packaging."
