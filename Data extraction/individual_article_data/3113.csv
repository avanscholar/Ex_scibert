0,Introduction,"Hydrogenases are involved in energy metabolism in one way or the other. They are diverse in their protein structure and in the type of electron carrier they use [1]. According to their metal content, three kinds of hydrogenases have been described: namely, the [NiFe] hydrogenases [2], [Fe] hydrogenases [3], and the metal-free hydrogenases [4]. Among these, the [NiFe] hydrogenases are the most abundant. Hydrogenases can also be divided into uptake hydrogenases and H 2 -evolving hydrogenases, according to their functions. The uptake hydrogenases catalyze H 2 oxidation linked to energy conserving reactions such as respiration, NAD(P)H formation, or methanogenesis [5]. On the other hand, the H 2 -evolving hydrogenases catalyze H + reduction and H 2 production coupled with the disposal of excess reducing potential through the re-oxidation of reduced pyridine nucleotides and electron carriers. Bacterial hydrogen production by dark fermentation of organic substrates is a ubiquitous phenomenon under anoxic or anaerobic conditions. A wide variety of bacteria use the reduction of protons to hydrogen to dispose reducing equivalents which result from primary metabolism. Depending on the metabolic pathways leading to H 2 evolution, two groups of bacteria are known. The first one, represented by Escherichia coli and other members of the Enterobacteriaceae, is facultative anaerobes and produces H 2 by the action of formate hydrogen lyase (FHL) complex. They possess the pyruvate formate lyase (PFL) for splitting of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and formate, and FHL for the subsequent conversion of formate to CO 2 and H 2 . The FHL is a very complicated enzyme, which consists of a formate dehydrogenase (FDH), hydrogenase, and various electron carriers [6]. In the second group, which includes strict anaerobes such as Clostridium butylicum, H 2 production occurs during decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA by pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR). Reduced ferredoxin transfers electrons to protons to produce H 2 via a ferredoxin-dependent hydrogenase. We have been studying a new H 2 -producing, chemoheterotrophic bacterium Citrobacter amalonaticus Y19 [7–10]. This strain produces H 2 from various carbon sources including carbon monoxide by water–gas shift type of reaction and sugars by anaerobic fermentation. It is a facultative anaerobe having the maximum specific growth rate on glucose of 0.76 h - 1 , and produces H 2 in a wide range of pH (5–9) and temperature (25– 40 ∘ C ). The strain Y19 has also shown a high volumetric H 2 production rate, 16 mmol H 2 L - 1 h - 1 , with a stable production capability during continuous fermentation process. Therefore, the strain Y19 is considered a promising H 2 producer from carbon monoxide and/or various organic substrates. The purpose of the present study is to investigate various hydrogenases and H 2 production metabolism in C. amalonaticus Y19. For this purpose, we have studied H 2 production during batch fermentation of Y19 with glucose or pyruvate as a sole carbon source. Carbon metabolites were measured and carbon fluxes were determined. Hydrogenase activity in whole cell and broken cell extract were also investigated with various carbon sources and electron donors such as glucose, pyruvate, formate, methylviologen (MV) and benzylviologen (BV). This study will identify the enzyme systems involved in H 2 metabolism and improve our understanding on fermentative H 2 production in Y19."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Culture medium and growth condition,"2.1 Culture medium and growth condition An isolate, C. amalonaticus Y19, was cultured in a PFN mineral salt medium containing 3.0 g l - 1 yeast extract and 10mM glucose or 20mM pyruvate under dark anaerobic conditions for 10h. This medium was fortified with a phosphate buffer (100mM; pH 7.0) and the experiments were conducted in a serum bottle (165ml; working volume 50ml) at 30 ∘ C . After inoculating the seed culture, the bottles were flushed with argon (Ar) gas (99.9%) for 10min to ensure that the bottles were completely deprived of O 2 . The bottles were then sealed with butyl rubber septum and aluminum cap."
3,Preparation of crude cell and membranous extracts,"2.2 Preparation of crude cell and membranous extracts Late exponential cells were harvested and washed twice with an ice-cold phosphate buffer (pH 7.0, 50mM) and then resuspended in 50mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.3) containing 2mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 1mM sodium dithionite (buffer A). Cells were then disrupted by using a bead beater (Fastprep FP120, Qbiogene Inc., USA) at a speed of 6.0 for 20s twice with 10s intervals. Undisrupted cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 20min. Crude membrane was isolated from cell extracts by centrifugation at 35 , 000 × g for 1h. The supernatant and membrane fractions after being suspended in buffer A were used for analyzing hydrogenase activities. All the preparations of cell fractions were carried out under Ar atmosphere in an anaerobic chamber (Bactron 1.5, Sheldon Manufacturing Inc., USA)."
4,Enzyme assay,"2.3 Enzyme assay Enzymes were assayed at 30 ∘ C either in 12ml serum bottles or in 4ml cuvettes under anoxic conditions. Enzyme activity of 1U corresponds to 1 μ mol H 2 formed or consumed min - 1 . For hydrogen uptake activity, oxidized forms of MV and BV were used as electron acceptors and the reduction of MV/BV was measured calorimetrically at 580nm. The reaction mixture contained buffer A and an electron acceptor at 2mM, and was equilibrated with 100% hydrogen. For hydrogen formation activity, reduced MV, NAD(P)H, and formate were used as electron donors and the oxidation of electron donor was measured. Sodium dithionite of 10mM was also added. Hydrogen evolution was analyzed from the gas phase using gas chromatograph. Formate dehydrogenase activity was measured using formate as an electron donor. The reaction mixture contained buffer A, 2mM MV(ox), and 10mM formate, and was equilibrated with 100% Ar."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Protein content was measured by Bradford method using BSA as a standard. Cell growth was measured by using spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer Lamda 20, Norwalk, CT, USA). The H 2 content was measured using a gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies Foster, CS, USA) equipped with TCD and porapak Q column. Organic acids and alcohol analyses were carried out by using HPLC (1100 series Agilent Technologies Foster, CS, USA)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Carbon metabolism in C. amalonaticus Y19,"3.1 Carbon metabolism in C. amalonaticus Y19 C. amalonaticus Y19 was cultivated anaerobically with glucose and pyruvate as carbon sources, and its metabolism and carbon fluxes were analyzed based on the production of metabolites (Fig. 1 ). The metabolism of glucose and pyruvate were acidogenic, and exhibited a typical mixed-acid fermentation as in other enteric bacteria [11,12]. For both substrates, more than 90% of the initial carbon substrate input was recovered as various carbon metabolites. When glucose was used as a carbon source, lactate (41%) was obtained as the major metabolite. In addition, significant amounts of ethanol (19.3%), acetate (11.5%) and succinate (7.8%) were also obtained as end products. In general, glucose catabolism under anaerobic conditions is associated with the production of considerable amount of reducing equivalents, which facilitates rapid conversion of pyruvate to lactate. In the case of pyruvate catabolism, the major product was acetate (58.2%). Succinate (14.7%) and lactate (6.3%) were also obtained, whereas ethanol was not detected (Fig. 1). The metabolic analysis suggests that pyruvate is the most favored substrate for acetate production. When supplying pyruvate as a sole source of carbon, pyruvate can partition to acetyl-CoA, lactate, and acetoin. However, the conversion of pyruvate to lactate is low owing to a limited NADH supply. Presumably, PFL mediated pyruvate catabolism of enteric bacteria does not produce NADH and this could be the factor for reduced production of lactate. Similarly, ethanol production was not detected with pyruvate as a carbon source since it is a NADH-dependent process and NADH is limited for this process. The conversion of acetyl-CoA to acetate is involved with ATP production and, therefore, acetate formation is favored to ethanol production in pyruvate catabolism. The accumulation of formate was very low as 1.5% and 2.7% with glucose and pyruvate, respectively, since it was further metabolized to CO 2 and H 2 . Although the strain Y19 is known to have CO-dependent hydrogenase, the anaerobic metabolism of organic carbons seems to be not much different from that of other facultative enteric bacteria. The rest of this study is focused on the characterization of the FHL complex and verifying the presence of uptake hydrogenases."
8,The effect of formate and chloramphenicol on H 2 production in C. amalonaticus Y19,"3.2 The effect of formate and chloramphenicol on H 2 production in C. amalonaticus Y19 The aerobically grown Y19 culture was shifted to an anaerobic condition under argon atmosphere (Fig. 2 ). Formate and/or chloramphenicol were added to the culture to ensure the expression of formate linked hydrogenase activity. Hydrogen production was initiated when the culture was shifted to anaerobic condition. When supplemented with chloramphenicol, H 2 production was not observed irrespective of the addition of formate (Fig. 2b). The addition of chloramphenicol represses the formate induced hydrogenase and the synthesis of new enzymes [13]. The result in Fig. 2b indicates that formate-dependent hydrogenase activity is induced in anaerobic condition only. When chloramphenicol is not added, the growth patterns of Y19 in glucose only and glucose plus formate were very similar. Final cell densities for both cases were also identical. However, H 2 production was promoted when in supplemented form with formate in addition to glucose (Fig. 2b). In addition, the difference in the number of moles of H 2 production between the two cases was almost equal to the number of moles of formate added. This implies that formate is not used as carbon source for the formation of the cell mass but is an immediate reactant that is split into H 2 and CO 2 ."
9,Whole cell hydrogen production activity in C. amalonaticus Y19,"3.3 Whole cell hydrogen production activity in C. amalonaticus Y19 The H 2 production activity in the whole cells of C. amalonaticus Y19 was studied for various carbon substrates and artificial dyes (Fig. 3 ). Beside glucose, Y19 could produce H 2 from pyruvate, formate, reduced MV, and BV but not from NAD(P)H (data not shown). Among the various substrates, reduced BV ( 450 nmol H 2 mg dcw - 1 min - 1 ) and formate ( 430 nmol H 2 mg dcw - 1 min - 1 ) exhibited the highest H 2 production activity. Sodium hypophosphate (HPP), a formate analog, has been reported as a potent inhibitor of PFL activity, but had no effect on FHL complex [14]. When HPP was added into the reaction medium, H 2 was not produced from glucose and pyruvate; whereas MV(red), BV(red), and formate-dependent hydrogen production activity remained. This confirms that, in the strain Y19, FHL is the enzyme responsible for H 2 production as in E. coli. When BV(ox), and MV(ox) were used as electron acceptor, the hydrogen uptake activities were observed as 45 and 35 nmol H 2 mg dcw - 1 min - 1 , respectively (Fig. 3). This result indicates that Y19 has an uptake hydrogenase similar to Hyd-1 or Hyd-2 of E. coli [15,16]."
10,Induction profile of hydrogenases of C. amalonaticus Y19,"3.4 Induction profile of hydrogenases of C. amalonaticus Y19 It has been reported that different hydrogenases are induced at different times during cultivation [17]. In order to study the induction profile of different hydrogenases in the strain Y19, hydrogenase activities were monitored during batch cultivation with formate, MV(red), or H 2 plus MV(ox) (Fig. 4 ). With MV(red) or formate as electron donor, H 2 -evolving hydrogenase activity is measured, whereas the reaction with the MV(ox) and H 2 yields an uptake hydrogenase activity. Fig. 4 indicates that the cell growth and H 2 accumulation are coincident with each other but the appearance of hydrogenase activities measured with different electron donor or acceptor is not. Formate-dependent, H 2 producing activity increases rapidly from the beginning of the cell growth and reaches a maximum during the exponential growth period. On the other hand, MV(ox)-dependent, H 2 -consuming activity increases rather slowly and reaches a maximum, 35 nmol H 2 mg dcw - 1 min - 1 , at the stationary phase. The maximum H 2 -producing activity was measured as 470 nmol H 2 mg dcw - 1 min - 1 . This indicates that the strain Y19 contains multiple hydrogenases which are induced differently from each other. When MV(red) was used as an electron donor, the strain Y19 could produce H 2 . It is not clear whether this activity is resulted from the hydrogenase of FHL complex or another hydrogenase located in cell membrane. The membrane-associated or membrane-bound hydrogenase of Escherichia coli is known to be involved in H 2 oxidation physiologically, but they can catalyze the reverse reaction to produce H 2 when excessive electron donors are given. The induction pattern of MV(red)-dependent hydrogenase activity shown in Fig. 4b is very similar to that of hydrogen uptake activity measured with MV(ox) and H 2 . Therefore, it is speculated that the MV(red)-dependent H 2 production activity is associated with an uptake hydrogenase rather than the hydrogenase of FHL complex."
11,Study of different hydrogenases in cell-free crude extracts,"3.5 Study of different hydrogenases in cell-free crude extracts The localization and characteristics of hydrogenases in the strain Y19 were investigated using crude cell extracts. Different electron donors and acceptors such as NAD(P)H, glucose, pyruvate, formate, MV(red), BV(red), MV(ox), and BV(ox) were used for measuring in vitro hydrogenase activity of the strain Y19 (Table 1 ). When glucose or pyruvate was used as carbon substrate, H 2 production was not observed with broken cells or cell-free extracts (Table 1). This indicates that degradation of glucose and pyruvate to formate and subsequent H 2 production by FHL cannot be completed once the cells are disintegrated [18]. Kanai et al. reported that presence of soluble cytosolic NAD(P)H-dependent sulfhydrogenases in Thermococcus kodakaraensis [19]. This hydrogenase had the ability to utilize NADPH as an electron donor. However, the activity of NAD(P)H mediated cytosolic hydrogenase was not detected in the strain Y19. When formate was added, H 2 production activity was observed in the broken cell extract, although the level was very low. The formate-dependent H 2 production activity was not detected in the soluble and particulate fractions (Table 1). This result, along with the fact that FDH activity is observed in the soluble fraction when BV(ox) or MV(ox) was used as electron acceptor (Table 2 ), suggests that the structure of the FHL complex of the strain Y19 is very similar to that of E. coli. The FHL complex in E. coli is composed of an FDH, hydrogenase, and several electron transport proteins, among which the FDH and hydrogenase are present in cytoplasm and associated with the membrane embedded electron transport proteins. The structural integrity of this complex FHL seems to remain partially conserved during the cell breakage by bead beater, but is completely lost in the subsequent preparation for the soluble and particulate fraction. The soluble and particulate fractions of crude extract exhibited hydrogenase activity with MV(red), BV(red), MV(ox), and BV(ox). The maximum H 2 production activity, 10.6 μ mol H 2 mg protein - 1 min - 1 , was observed in the membrane fraction when MV(red) was used as electron donor (Table 1). Similarly, when MV(ox) was used as electron acceptor, the membrane fraction showed the maximum H 2 uptake activity as 3.112 μ mol H 2 mg protein - 1 min - 1 . Perhaps, this is attributed to that a membrane-bound hydrogenase is bidirectional and it is concentrated in the particulate fraction to a high degree during preparation. The hydrogenase activity of the soluble fraction, both production and uptake, might be resulting from either FHL-related soluble hydrogenase or contaminants from membrane-bound hydrogenase during preparation. In any case, these results indicate that there exist multiple hydrogenases such as FHL and uptake hydrogenase in the strain Y19."
12,FDH and FDH-dependent hydrogenase activity,"3.6 FDH and FDH-dependent hydrogenase activity The FDH and FDH-dependent hydrogenase activities in the subcellular fractions were examined in the presence of formate with MV(ox) and BV(ox) in the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture containing only formate has no activity on either hydrogen production or uptake activity. However, when formate was added with MV(ox) and BV(ox), the soluble fraction showed dye reduction activities at 7.63 and 3.87 nmol H 2 mg protein - 1 min - 1 , respectively (Table 2). When the dye was replaced by NAD, NAD reduction was not observed. This indicates that NAD cannot be used as electron acceptor of the FDH from the FHL complex of Y19. Table 2 also suggests the existence of an FDH and hydrogenase derived from the FHL complex as dissociated form in the soluble fraction. The dissociated FHL complex in the form of an FDH and hydrogenase are active in soluble form when formate is supplied with MV/BV (ox). These two enzymes along with a dye used as an artificial electron coupler between the two enzymes reconstitute the FHL activity as evidenced by H 2 production. In the particulate fraction, neither FDH nor FDH-dependent hydrogenase was observed."
13,Conclusion,"In this manuscript, we investigated the metabolic pattern, the existence of different hydrogenases, and their localizations in the strain C. amalonaticus Y19. The strain showed typical mixed-acid fermentation as other enteric bacteria. Production of H 2 was demonstrated with various substrates, and formate was found to be the favored substrate than glucose and pyruvate. A major portion of H 2 production activity in the strain Y19 was mediated by an FHL complex which includes an FDH and hydrogenase. The hydrogenase present in the particulate fraction of crude cell extract had the activity for both H 2 production and uptake."
