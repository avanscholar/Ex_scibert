0,Introduction,"Brazil is the world's largest producer of sugarcane ethanol (approximately 30.4 billion liters per year in 2018) with more than 400 ethanol plants spread across the country [1]. Therefore, bagasse generation (166 million tons/year) after sugarcane crushing and ethanol production take place in a large part of the country. This makes the resultant lignocellulosic wastes one of the most attractive sources of energy, consisting of natural polymers formed by carbohydrates such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, which are responsible for their energy content [2,3]. This kind of biomass has great potential to be used as feedstock for the production of low-cost biofuels. Traditional liquefaction process, such as the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) or thermal liquefaction (TL) using organic solvents, has been investigated as an efficient process to convert wet lignocellulosic biomass into liquid products. The HTL process is carried out at moderate temperatures (250–350 °C) and high pressure (50–250 bar) [4,5] producing a biocrude with a higher heating value (HHV) compared with its respective biomass [6,7]. On the other hand, alcoholic solvents have received considerable attention due of their high reactivity [8,9] and because aliphatic alcohols act as a hydrogen donor. The main advantages of using such kind of solvents are the higher solubility of compounds due to their dielectric constant being lower than water, easy separation of the products obtained by solvent distillation, low corrosivity, hydrogen donation that stabilizes the radicals formed in the thermal cleavage, besides the high yields in biocrude above 40% [10,11]. Studies have shown the advantages of using alcohols since they reduce the biomass monomers decomposition and repolymerization during the liquefaction compared to water. Furthermore, alcohols as liquefaction solvents increase the esters generation as stable products at the end of the process [11,12], reducing the biofuel acidity and corrosivity. The fusel oil consists in a heavy residue produced during the ethanol distillation. It is a mixture of higher alcohols, such as isoamyl, isobutyl, propyl, ethyl, methyl alcohols, and lower amounts of acids, esters, and aldehydes. This oil is widely produced in Brazil, where the average fusel oil ratio is estimated at 2.5 L per 1000 L of ethanol reaching a production of about 80 million liters/year [13,14]. One small part of this product has been sold for isoamyl alcohol production and, most of them has been burnt for energy generation [15]. Table 1 shows some articles found in the literature in which esters were produced by biomass liquefaction or by direct transesterification. This current study investigates the effect of fusel oil and anhydrous ethanol on the liquefaction process of sugarcane bagasse. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the fusel oil, generated during ethanol fermentation and distillation, is investigated as an efficient solvent for the biomass liquefaction process. In order to verify a possible synergetic effect between ethanol and fusel oil, a mixture of these solvents was also used. Yields of liquefaction products (biocrude) conversion and biochar were presented as well as their chemical characterization. It also evaluates the simultaneous esterification reactions between the acids from the as-synthetised biocrude and the alcohols from the solvents and transesterification of ethyl esters to isoamyl esters. In the present route, the biomass liquefaction and the biocrude upgrading occur in a one-spot process with economic advantages. The high content of oxygenated compounds in the biocrude hinders the use of this product as a pure fuel, which suggests its use a blend component with fossil fuels, such as ethanol in gasoline or biodiesel in diesel [20]. Consequently, it was proposed the use of the as-synthesized biocrude in a mixture with 5 wt% of marine diesel. The maritime sector was chosen as subject of this work since it has an urgent demand for biofuels to reduce emissions and pollution and meet the recently issued regulations. This sector is accountable for 33% of all fossil fuel burning emissions, including 3.3% of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere [22]. This is an innovative study with the potential of re-use the wastes generated by the ethanol industry which plays an important role in the global biofuel sector. The proposal is also an interesting alternative as a circular economy for the bioethanol sector."
1,Experimental section,
2,Processing and characterization of sugarcane bagasse,"2.1 Processing and characterization of sugarcane bagasse Sugarcane bagasse was kindly provided by commercial producers from Belo Horizonte/MG/Brazil shortly after the sugarcane juice extraction in mills. The bagasse was dried at 105 °C and the dried fibers were cut, crushed in a hammer mill and sieved. The pre-processed bagasse was analyzed by measuring its moisture and ash content according to ASTM E1756-08 and ASTM E1755-01, respectively. The proximate and ultimate analyses of the sugarcane bagasse are listed in Table S1. The higher heating value (HHV) of the bagasse was determined according to the ASTM D240 method, using the IKA model C200 oxygen combustion calorimeter, where the sample was burned in the presence of excess oxygen."
3,Characterization of fusel oil,"2.2 Characterization of fusel oil Fusel oil was kindly supplied by a bioethanol production plant in the state of Minas Gerais/Brazil and the anhydrous ethanol was obtained commercially (Anidrol®, 99.5%). The fusel oil acidity (mg KOH.g−1) was measured by the methodology described by Instituto Adolfo Lutz [21].The fusel oil water content was determined by the Karl Fischer method on a Metrohm 831 KF Coulometer in compliance with the standard ASTM D6304. Kinematic viscosity was determined according to ASTM D445 on a THERMO HAAKE-PHOENIX thermostatic bath and a Cannon Fenske viscometer. Density analyses were performed according to ASTM D4052 using an Anton Paar Densimeter DMA 4500-Density Meter. The HHV of fusel oil was measured as previously mentioned for sugarcane bagasse."
4,Bagasse thermal liquefaction,"2.3 Bagasse thermal liquefaction The liquefaction processes were performed in triplicate using different solvents: fusel oil and anhydrous ethanol. Thermal liquefaction of sugarcane bagasse was processed in a 316L stainless steel (Parr Instruments) reactor with a capacity of 600 mL. The reactor was filled with approximately 10 g of sugarcane bagasse and 100 mL of solvent. Subsequently, the reactor was closed, purged three times with N2 and pressurized up to 10 bar at room temperature. The reaction took place at 300 °C by 30 min with a stirring speed of 100 rpm. After this, the reactor was depressurized and the reaction product was filtered to separate the biocrude and biochar. The biomass-to-solvent ratios, the maximum pressure reached during the reaction and the final pressure after cooling are presented in the Table 2 . The results obtained in this study are reported using the parameters defined as [22]: (1) C o n v e r s i o n % = m S B - m B i o c h a r / m S B × 100 (2) W b i o c h a r % = m B i o c h a r / m S B × 100 where, Conversion (%) is the conversion of the bagasse into liquids and gas; mSB is the mass of the sugarcane bagasse (g); mBiochar is the mass of the biochar; WBiochar is the percentage of biochar. The yields of the liquefaction products were determined as the mass percentage contents, calculated with the values of the feedstock mass introduced into the reactor and biochar mass. The gas product yield was calculated by the difference in relation to the liquid and solid products."
5,Biochar characterization,"2.4 Biochar characterization The biochar obtained from the liquefaction process was separated from the liquid fraction by vacuum filtration and dried in an oven at 105 °C by 24 h. The elemental composition analysis of the biochar was carried out on Perkin Elmer model equipment CHN PE2400 (CHN-O). The evaluation of thermal stability via TGA/DTGA was performed in an inert atmosphere (N2) using a TA Instruments thermobalance, model TGA Q50, in the temperature range of 25 to 800 °C, at a heating rate of 10 °C.min−1 with N2 flow rate of 60 mL.min−1. The HHV was determined as previously mentioned for bagasse. The zero charge point (pHPCZ) was measured according to the method reported in the literature [23]. The functional groups were analyzed using the FT-IR spectrometer with ATR (Attenuated Total Reflectance) accessory, model Frontier from Perkin Elmer, under the following conditions: scanning interval 4000 to 500 cm−1, resolution 4 cm−1 and 16 scans. Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM–EDS) was carried out on Dual Beam Microscope 3D FEG."
6,Liquid product distillation and characterization,"2.5 Liquid product distillation and characterization The liquid product obtained by bagasse liquefaction was separated into fractions using a typical bench-scale fractional distillation apparatus, which consisted of a 250 mL round bottom distillation flask, a heating mantle, a 15 cm Vigreaux column, a thermometer and a condenser at 5 °C. Distillation fractions were collected at a various range of vapor temperatures monitored at the distillation head. Only the liquid product obtained from the test with the highest conversion was distilled, for removing the excess solvent and obtaining the biocrude, which was characterized and tested as biofuel subsequently. The fractions and biocrude (atmospheric residue) obtained after liquid product distillation were characterized by elemental analysis using a CHN PE2400. Oxygen content was calculated by difference, and results were recalculated on a dry basis. The HHV was determined as previously mentioned for sugarcane bagasse. The pH was performed using an electrode DME-CVR13. Moisture content (ASTM D6304) was measured with Karl Fischer titration in methanol with Hydranal Karl Fischer as a titrant. The identification of the compounds presented in the biocrude and fractions was performed using a GC/MS from Shimadzu, model QP5050 with an auto-injector AOC-20i-Shimadzu. The samples were analyzed on an Elite 17HT column (phase: semi-polar) (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.15 µm), using a He-flow of 1.1 mL.min−1; injection volume of 1 µL in split mode (1:10); injector temperature and interface were 290 °C and 260 °C, respectively. The temperature program was from 45 °C (1 min) to 185 °C with a heating rate of 2.5 °C.min−1, after which the oven was heated at a rate of 5 °C.min−1 to 300 °C holding for 10 min. In the mass spectrometer, the ionization energy was 70 eV in an electron ionization system, m/z 45–500 range from 12 to 60 min. The compounds were elucidated using the Shimadzu GC/MS solution software and the libraries WILEY 229 and NIST 05, taking into account similarities above 85%. The concentration of each substance was reported as the area percentage of each compound based on the total area, which is considered a semi-quantitative analysis. The thermal stability of the atmospheric distillation residue, which is the biocrude, was evaluated by TGA/DTGA, as previously described."
7,Preparation of biocrude-maritime diesel blend,"2.6 Preparation of biocrude-maritime diesel blend A fossil maritime diesel (95 wt%) was used for the blend preparation with biocrude (atmospheric distillation residue) (5 wt%) as biofuel. After that, the mixture was homogenized using a vortex mixer. This blend was characterized by determining the sulfur content according to ASTM D4294 and by moisture content, density, kinematic viscosity and HHV using protocols previously mentioned."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Bagasse liquefaction,"3.1 Bagasse liquefaction The effect of different solvents on the average biochar yields and on the average sugarcane bagasse conversion is displayed in Fig. 1 . The conversion is the percentage of solid bagasse which was converted into non-solid products, such as liquid and gases. According to results presented in Fig. 1, the processes in which the fusel oil was used as liquefaction solvent reached higher bagasse conversion values, that is, 79%, 91%, and 86% for TLFO-1, TLFO-2, and TLFO-3, respectively, against conversion of 72% for TL, with pure ethanol. These results show that alcohols with higher chain sizes influence the liquefaction process, providing greater degradation of biopolymers, stabilization of fragments by hydrogenation/alkylation of the compounds, and solubilization of high molecular weight polar compounds [9]. Furthermore, the results (Fig. 1) confirmed the data presented in the study published by Zou et al [8], in which the authors stated that higher boiling point solvents promote greater contact between the biomass and the solvent during the liquefaction process, resulting in enhanced liquefaction efficiency. A comparison between the two processes carried out using fusel oil as liquefaction solvent (TLFO-1 and TLFO-2) shows that liquefaction performed at ratio 1:10 (TLFO-2) achieved higher conversion (91%) whilst the ratio 1:5 led to the conversion of 79%. Therefore, it can be inferred that excess solvent leads to better solubilization of biomass components [24–26]. The blend of alcohols used in TLFO-3 at the ratio 1:5:5 resulted in 86% of liquefied bagasse, indicating synergetic effects between both solvents. It is believed that the choice for the most profitable solvent is key for the liquefaction process and it may vary depending on whether or not the fusel oil is valued in the local market. The reaction TLFO-2 led to the highest biomass conversion and hence to the lowest biochar yield (9%) which is due to the decrease of repolymerization reactions between unstable fragments induced by alcohols of long alkyl chains, consequently increasing the liquid product yields [9,11]. These results strongly evidence the great performance of fusel oil as a bagasse liquefaction solvent since it has decreased the biochar yield by 3 times in comparison to pure ethanol (TLFO-2 versus TL), from 28% to 9%. Therefore, in the same conditions, the fusel oil presented a conversion 26% higher than the anhydrous ethanol (91% for TLFO-2 versus 72% for TL) for the bagasse liquefaction process, which is very significant and can reduce the biocrude cost. The results showed that the solvent plays an important role in the liquefaction of lignocellulosic biomass. It initiates the degradation of macromolecule components by hydrolysis or solvolysis and then several other reactions may occur, including cracking, dehydration, dehydrogenation, hydrodeoxygenation, decarboxylation and/or decarbonylation. The fragmented molecules during the liquefaction process may rearrange themselves through condensation, cycling and/or polymerization reactions to generate different types of compounds with varying molar masses. The presence of alcohols, in supercritical or subcritical conditions, generates hydrogen in situ, which increases the biocrude yield and reduces the coke formation, which is carbon in the aromatic form, whose structure is deficient in hydrogen. Since the macromolecules of the biopolymers of the bagasse are decomposed into smaller and unstable species, the active hydrogen donated by the alcohols can stabilize these reactive intermediates, avoiding condensation and aromatization [25,27–29]. Simultaneously with the bagasse liquefaction in the presence of fusel oil, the acids generated by the biomass decomposition reacted with the ethanol or fusel oil alcohols, via esterification. The process of transesterification of ethyl esters presented in the fusel oil in isoamyl and butyl esters also defined conditions. These esters are less corrosive and more suitable for application in the biofuels formulation, especially if they have larger chains as is the case of those produced with the fusel oil alcohols [25,27–29]. This is an important mechanism that turns a two-step process into one, decreasing the costs and simplifying the process, which apparently occurs in a very quick kinetics most likely due to the supercritical state of the alcohols (Tc,ethanol = 243 °C; pc,etanol = 63 bar; Tc,amyl alcohol = 304 °C; pc,amyl alcohol = 39 bar)."
10,Distillation of the liquid product TLFO-2 and fractions characterization,"3.2 Distillation of the liquid product TLFO-2 and fractions characterization The distillation of the liquid product from the reaction TLFO-2 was preferably performed since it has achieved the highest conversion rate (91%) and contains longer carbon chains esters therefore presenting a greater similarity with the diesel chains, as well as a greater energy content. The distillation process resulted in two distilled fractions that totalize 44.6% and an atmospheric residue equivalent to 33.3% from the raw liquid product, as shown in Table 3 . The Fraction-1 covers the distillation range of 25–80 °C, Fraction-2 covers the range of 80–128 °C and the atmospheric residue corresponds to compounds of boiling point higher than 128 °C. At this residual fraction of the distillation contains the majority of the in situ synthesized esters, according to the CG/MS data that will be presented. As these esters are the most desired products from this process, it is reasonable to denominate the residue as biocrude. This biocrude is dark-brown colored, highly viscous at room temperature and has a strong smell. It has occurred a 22.1 ± 3.8% loss during distillation, which should refer to the losses of highly volatile compounds. The three fractions obtained from the distillation were characterized by CHN-O, HHV, pH, moisture content and GC/MS. The biocrude (residue) was further characterized by TGA. The results showed there was about 22% of losses during distillation, which can be reduced in an industrial process, in large scale. The moisture content of the three fractions indicates the presence of water generated over the process of liquefaction such as condensation between alcohols and acids or free carbonyls [30]. The Fraction-1 presented an elevated moisture content (27.4%) higher than the moisture content fusel oil itself (12.5%). This may have occurred due to azeotrope formation between water and other compounds of this fraction. The carbon content of both the biocrude (69.8%) and the Fraction-2 (63.2%) are higher compared to Fraction-1 (41.8%), whereas the oxygen content of Fraction-1 (44.4%) is higher than in the biocrude (16.9%) and Fraction-2 (24.1%). Higher carbon content and lower oxygen content result in higher HHV value, which was 30.6 MJ.kg−1 for biocrude and 26.6 MJ.kg−1 for Fraction-2. The molar ratio H/C showed similar values for Fraction-2 and biocrude (2.3 and 2.1, respectively) and a high value for Fraction-1 (3.7). This last value is high due to the elevated water content in Fraction 1. Similar behavior is observed for O/C ratio (0.8) compared to other sample ratios. The O/C ratio showed the lowest value for the biocrude (0.2). This result suggests the predominance of compounds with long carbonyl chains and lower oxygen content in biocrude. Both biocrude and fusel oil presented similar HHV, despite higher water content for the fusel oil, which also has higher O/C. It can be explained mainly because fusel oil has many compounds with long chains with higher HHV values. 3.2.1 Characterization of distillation fractions by GC/MS The Table 4 presents the main compounds identified by GC/MS in the fusel oil, Fraction-1, Fraction-2 and biocrude obtained from distillation. The chromatograms of the samples are illustrated in Figure S1. Due to the complexity of fusel oil, only compounds of peak area superior to 0.5% were presented in Table 4. The percentage values (taken by integration of the total ion chromatogram) represent the proportion of the peak area of each compound in the sample. It indirectly indicates the proportions of the individual components in the samples, but not their actual concentration [31]. The major compounds identified in fusel oil were the isoamyl alcohol (69.8%), ethyl decanoate (9.8%) and ethyl octanoate (3.9%). Only one type of carboxylic acid, the octanoic acid, was detected in low quantity in the sample (0.9%), which justifies the pH of 6.4, which is closer to neutrality, according to Table 3. In general, 77% of fusel oil composition is constituted of alcohols with carbon atoms in the C3-C5 range and 22% of its composition refers to heavy esters with carbon chains in the C8-C18 range. The results obtained for the chemical composition of the fusel oil sample are compatible with data from the literature [14,32]. In Fraction-1 (F1), distilled from 25 to 80 °C, it was detected some compounds absent in fusel oil sample such as 3-methyl-butanal, 1,1-diethoxyethane, acetic acid isobutyl ester, formic acid isoamyl ester, and acetic acid isoamyl ester. These were certainly produced during the bagasse liquefaction and because they are mostly esters, may have been synthesized via esterification of the acids and alcohols present in the reaction system. On the other hand, the Fraction-2 (F2), distilled from 80 to 128 °C, has the same compounds present in fusel oil, except for the acetic acid isoamyl ester. As the isoamyl alcohol is predominant in both F1 and F2, these fractions can be considered as the recovering of the excess fusel oil unreacted that may well be reused as liquefaction solvent in a new liquefaction process, consisting in a cyclic, sustainable and cost-effective process suitable for the industrial scenario. In the biocrude composition compounds such as oxygenated aromatics (4-ethylphenol) and long alkyl chains esters (decanoic acid isoamyl ester) were detected in addition to some of the fusel oil constituents such as the isoamyl alcohol (17.2%). The phenol content is very low due to the low content of lignin in this biomass, and these compounds were probably concentrated as biochar constituents. The esters originated from isoamyl alcohol add up to 52.4% in total, whilst the acetic acid esters consist in 22.5%. Phenols are represented only by 2.5%, long chain hydrocarbons by 2.8% and anhydride by 1.3%, out of 98.7% of identified compounds, being 1.3% related to the unidentified compounds due to their low contents (traces). The results confirm the presence of about 75% of products of the esterification reaction between carboxylic acids and alcohols, present in fusel oil, biocrude, and ethanol, when this last alcohol was used. In addition, probably there was a conversion of ethyl esters via transesterification into isobutyl or isoamyl esters, which generated long-chain esters (C7 to C17). As different reactions occurred simultaneously it is impossible to discuss the exact mechanisms, further investigation must be done for this purpose. It is important to mention that in the literature these reactions occur over long periods of time (up to 25 h) with the use of heterogeneous acid catalysts based on multivalent metallic salts that include chlorides, nitrates, sulfates, and acetates of Fe3+, Al3+, Ga3+, In3+, ZrO2+, HfO2+, Zn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Mn3+, Cr3+ and Cu2+ [33]. As the experiments of this study were conducted under supercritical or subcritical conditions, esterification occurred widely and very quickly with no use of catalysts, consisting in a cost-effective, simple and environmental friendly process. It was not detected in the biocrude the presence of non-esterified carboxylic acids, since these are the limiting compounds and the fusel oil, rich in isoamyl alcohol, was used in excess, justifying the amount of 17.2% of this alcohol unreacted. These results of simultaneous liquefaction of the bagasse and esterification are quite relevant, as they present a simplified alternative to some laborious esterification processes. The conversion rate was high, no catalyst was needed and the reaction time was quite short. This implies an upgrading of the products, simultaneous to the generation of the biocrude, leading to long chain products with low oxygenation standard. Furthermore, a considerably feasible and economic synthesis of esters would boost the production of biofuels, food and fragrance industries due their high demand for esters. Isoamyl ester synthesis usually occurs via Fischer esterification and via lipase catalyzed esterification, which is a potential application for fusel oil as a source of these types of esters [34,35]. 3.2.2 Thermogravimetric analysis of biocrude The TG/DTG curves for biocrude are shown in Fig. 2 a and the volatilization/degradation range temperatures obtained by analyzing the TG curve are shown in Fig. 2b. The TG curve of the biocrude shows that up to 100 °C, 21% of the mass of the biocrude sample was lost (maximum peak of decomposition at 57 °C), which is mainly related to the evaporation of light volatile compounds and water. The second event of greatest mass loss occurs between 100 °C and 200 °C, with a maximum peak of decomposition at 147 °C, losing 42% of its organic compounds. The TG can be used as an estimate of the biocrude boiling point when N2 is used as carrier gas [36]. Typically, 37.6% of the biocrude has a volatilization/thermal degradation range from 200 °C to a temperature greater than 750 °C, consisting of compounds of high molar mass. The TG curve shows that all biocrude was completely decomposed at 800 °C, showing the absence of inorganic materials in the product. The results obtained by the thermal analysis are consistent with the GC/MS analysis, the elemental analysis and HHV, showing the presence of compounds with a high molecular mass in the composition of the biocrude. It is noteworthy that compounds with a high boiling point do not volatilize in the chromatographic columns due to their low operating temperatures (300–350 °C), therefore they cannot be detected by GC/MS [30] being better visualized by the TG curve, especially for mass losses at temperatures above 350 °C."
11,Biocrude-maritime diesel blend,"3.3 Biocrude-maritime diesel blend Studies have been developed using blends of fusel oil with gasoline or diesel (in proportions of 10 and 20% fusel oil), showing to be acceptable for use in internal combustion engines, as well as ethanol. These blends contributed to the reduction of NOx emissions, however, they presented as disadvantages higher emissions of CO and unburned hydrocarbons, when compared to other alcohols, such as: ethanol, methanol and butanol, and blends with diesel can generate separations of phase, especially when the proportions of fusel oil added are greater than 20%. These disadvantages occur due to the presence of various types of alcohols with long alkyl chains and water present in the fusel oil, which also cause instability for different operating conditions of the ignition engines [37,38]. In order to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels in the marine fuels scenario, it was studied the partial replacement of the marine diesel (MD) by biocrude (distillation residue fraction). A blend was prepared with 5 wt% biocrude and 95 wt% marine diesel [39] and the physicochemical properties of this mixture were then assessed in terms of sulphur content, water content, density, kinematic viscosity at 40 °C and HHV, performed according to standard methodologies. The blend, named as B5, was filtered and had a final visual aspect free of impurities. The results are presented in Table 5 . The limits of each parameter, in compliance with Brazilian (RANP) and ISO regulamentations, are displayed in Table 5. The blend B5 did not exceed the limit values stated in the resolutions ANP 52/2010 and ISO 8217:2010, being a potential alternative for application as marine fuel. Blending maritime diesel with biocrude, even in small percentages, is an interesting measure for reducing the sulphur content of MD hence reducing the sulphur and particulate matter emissions in the atmosphere. Moreover, the HHV increased after blending, not affecting the diesel energy efficiency as expected, since the biocrude has considerable oxygen content in its composition. Further studies must be done to evaluate the modifications in the MD blend, using higher contents, especially because the result variations (Table 5) may be within the error of the method used. Overall, great contributions to the mitigation of GHG emissions are expected by applying the upgraded biocrude in a blend with a maritime fuel."
12,Characterization of biochar,"3.4 Characterization of biochar The results obtained from the CHN-O, HHV, ash content, pHPCZ, and electrical conductivity (EC) of the biochars obtained from the thermal liquefaction processes in the presence of fusel oil and the ethanol/fusel oil mixture, are shown in Fig. 3 . When comparing bagasse data with that of biochars, shown in Fig. 3, it is observed that there was an increase in the carbon content and a reduction in the oxygen content of biochars due to losses of volatile organic compounds, dehydration reactions (water production) and decarboxylation (production of acids, carbonyls, and CO2) as a result of liquefaction processes. These results are above those obtained in a study developed by Baloch et al [40] to obtain biochar via thermal liquefaction of sugarcane bagasse, in the presence of ethanol at 280 °C. This confirms the better efficiency of fusel oil in the processes of liquefaction and deoxygenation of sugarcane bagasse compared to ethanol. There was a great increase in the HHV of biochars, showing the efficiency of using these alcohols in the process of removing highly oxygenated compounds, generating a carbonaceous residue with greater potential for energy generation. The HHV in the range of 28 to 30 MJ.kg−1 is similar to that of mineral coal, important solid fossil fuel, and almost double the HHV of unprocessed bagasse, which is a very promising result. The biochars have shown that pHPCZ indicates the predominance of the slightly acid character of biochars. Acid groups in the biochar structure confirmed this result, as will be shown in 3.4.1 section. The pHPCZ of 5.35 was also reported by Hafshejani et al [41] for biochar derived from sugarcane bagasse obtained at 300 °C, a value similar to that found in the present study. The electrical conductivity (EC) is a parameter used to estimate the presence of soluble salts in a biochar solution. The results show that the TLFO-2 biochar has a high concentration of dissolved salts. Further investigation must be performed to explain this behavior since its ash content has an intermediate value. 3.4.1 Biochar infrared spectroscopy Fig. 4 shows the medium infrared (middle IR) spectra for biochars obtained in process. The results show that the biochars presented different bands in the infrared regions, differing from the bagasse, indicating changes in their properties after the thermal liquefaction process, as expected. The results showed that there was a reduction in the intensity of the –OH bands, located between 3200 and 3500 cm−1, on the surface of the biochar, suggesting that functional groups containing hydroxyls, such as alcohols, acids, and phenolics changed in the liquefaction process [42,43]. There was an increase in the bands that appeared between 2800 and 3000 cm−1 referring to the symmetrical and asymmetric stretching of C–H bonds of aliphatic groups. In this region, vibrations appear around 2933 cm−1 referring to the asymmetric vibration of –CH3 and in 2857 cm−1 referring to the symmetrical stretching of –CH3. Significative changes for the biochar can be seen around 1700–800 cm−1. The intensification of the band around 1715 cm−1 shows the presence of carboxylic groups (C=O) of carboxylic acids in biochars and confirmed the pHPCZ results. A band in 1032 cm−1, which refers to the stretching of the C–O molecular bonds of cellulose and lignin, considerably reduces its intensity in biochars after thermal liquefaction in fuel oil. Another band that also increased was found around 1599 cm−1, referring to the stretch band of C–H, and C=C of aromatics [44,45]. In 1211 cm−1 a band referring to the presence of groups C=O/C-O-C [44], the latter being related to aliphatic cellulose ethers. Finally, between 800 and 814 cm−1, bands appear regarding the presence of aromatic C–H. Certainly, an increase in the C=C band intensity of aromatics and a reduction in the -OH band implies that aromatization and dehydration reactions occurred during the liquefaction process, which is consistent with the aromatic structure of typical biochar [46]. 3.4.2 Thermogravimetric analysis The TG/DTG curves for biochar are shown in Fig. 5 a and b. These analyses are relevant to compare the effect of the different solvents in the biochar structure. It can also improve the comprehension of the liquefaction process and can indicate the potential application for this by-product. The biochars obtained in the thermal liquefaction of sugarcane bagasse in the presence of fusel oil (TLFO-1 and TLFO-2) and the fusel oil/ethanol mixture (TLFO-3) as solvents, showed a high thermal stability, despite the low processing temperature. This result is in accordance with the high carbon content and lower oxygen content found in these biochars. As shown in Fig. 5, all biochars had low moisture and volatile contents, varying between 0.9 and 2.7% up to a temperature of 100 °C. The greatest losses of mass occurred between 200 and 500 °C. The amounts of these losses are equivalent to 30.2%, 31.5%, 31.6%, and 63.9% for TLFO-1, TLFO-2, TLFO-3 and TL, respectively. For sugarcane bagasse (SB), in this same decomposition range, loses 74.6% of its mass. The thermal degradation characteristics of these biochars are very different from sugarcane bagasse. It is important to point out that the biochars produced with fusel oil (TLFO-1, TLFO-2, TLFO-3) have TG curves different from that observed for the carbon material produced with ethanol (TL). This behavior confirmed the great efficiency of fusel oil to perform the bagasse liquefaction, yielding biochars with exceptional thermal stability. The content of solid residue remaining after the final decomposition temperature (800 °C) of the biochars is very high and higher than the observed for char obtained from pyrolysis [47]. For the materials produced in this study, there are percentages equivalent to 53.2%, 50.1% and 54.9% for TLFO-1, TLFO-2 and TLFO-3, respectively, showing that the thermal decomposition behaviors are similar to each other and different from the biochar obtained with ethanol only (27.6%). It is known that most simple organic compounds decompose in the temperature range between 150 and 400 °C, and polymeric compounds in the range of 400–550 °C. Mass losses between 550 and 800 °C can be attributed to the decomposition of inorganic materials or also by aromatization and carbon condensation reactions [48–50]. Given the results of the elemental analysis, HHV and thermal analysis of the biochars, it can be concluded that these solid residues produced via thermal liquefaction in the presence of fusel oil and mixture of this with anhydrous ethanol present a great potential for application as a renewable solid fuel. 3.4.3 SEM-EDS The surface morphology and chemical mapping of biochar particles are shown in Figs. 6 and 7 . Fig. 6 shows the presence of a smooth surface with large cavities in the biochar. It presents a different aspect, with a certain organization, with a very smooth matrix, most likely due to the action of fusel oil, which after solubilizing the bagasse left a structural skeleton rich in carbon as waste. This is a very different image from those found in the literature for biochars of liquefaction or pyrolysis processes. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Fig. 6 a-b show disorganized fibrous structure. Fig. 7a-d shows that the main elements found were K, Ca, Fe, and Si. The identification of these elements may be related due to the insertion of inorganic materials present in the sugarcane bagasse. It can be said that the biochar resulting from the fusel oil process has inorganic compounds on its surface and has exceptional thermal stability, which can be exploited not only as an energy source but also as thermally stable biochar."
13,Conclusion,"This study showed that it is possible to produce biocrudes from sugarcane bagasse with high yields using fusel oil (91%) with a consequent low yield of biochar (9%) using a fast process (30 min), 300 °C and 10 bar of N2. Under these conditions, the solvent is in a supercritical or subcritical states with special properties. Esterification and transesterification took place, simultaneously to the liquefaction, in a one-step process. These reaction generated long-chain isoamyl esters with HHV of 30.6 MJ.kg−1, compatible with the diesel chains (C10-C20). The biochar produced in the bagasse liquefaction presented high thermal stability and HHV of 30 MJ.kg−1 and can be used as an energy source, within the the circular economy directives. A new kind of blend of biocrude and marine diesel (B5) was tested with good results. The use of the residues bagasse and fusel oil can add value to the ethanol and sugar production chain, making it more sustainable and cleaner."
