0,Introduction,"Ultra-high-strength steels (with tensile strength>1500 MPa) are commonly produced via the hot stamping process. In recent years, hot-stamped steel has gained more popularity in auto manufacturers because lightweight vehicles can be made by the steel without compromising passenger safety. Generally, such steels are used in critical safety components within the vehicle, such as B-pillar and anti-collision beam. However, the quality of the hot-stamped parts can be negatively impacted by hydrogen embrittlement and hydrogen-induced delayed fractures, i.e. passengers are not under effective protection during accidents. The reduction of mechanical properties caused by the penetration of hydrogen atoms is known as hydrogen embrittlement [1]. Some researches have confirmed that high-strength steel and ultra-high-strength steel are more sensitive to the hydrogen embrittlement due to high strength [2]. Hot-stamped steel is formed and quenched in a closed tool with cooling channels after getting full austenitization in the furnace, so its final microstructure is mainly martensite, which has been proved that it is more prone to hydrogen embrittlement [3,4]. The first discovery of hydrogen embrittlement that happened on steel was presented by Johnson [5] in 1875. Afterward, hydrogen embrittlement has become one of the important indicators to evaluate the reliability of metal products. Nowadays, the research on hydrogen embrittlement acquires more concern with the increasing production of vehicles. Venezuela et al. [6] compared the influence of hydrogen embrittlement on high-strength martensitic steels, i.e. MS980, MS1180, MS1300, and MS1500. Hydrogen embrittlement occurs more frequently on the material with higher strength, and the mechanical properties gradually decrease as hydrogen concentration increases. Lovicu et al. [7] compared the sensitivity of hydrogen embrittlement between hot-stamped steel, martensitic steel MS1400 and others. The result shows that hot-stamped steel and martensitic steel are more sensitive to hydrogen embrittlement due to full martensitic structure with brittle feature. In addition, Moro et al. [8] and Jo et al. [9] also studied the hydrogen embrittlement of high-strength steel such as X80 steel and 1.9 GPa-grade hot-stamping steel, respectively. The hydrogen embrittlement of high-strength steel is affected by many factors, such as charging current density, charging time, pre-strain, and material structure, etc. Du et al. [10] found that the hydrogen concentration increases with current density. Depover et al. [11] discovered that the hydrogen concentration increases continually during charging until it approaches a balance value. According to the work of Laureys et al. [12] and Li et al. [13], the plastic strain or pre-strain can promote the diffusion of hydrogen atoms. Dunne et al. [14] studied the effects of ferrite grain size and phase distribution on the hydrogen concentration and the hydrogen-induced crack morphology. Zhang et al. [15] found that the Nb & Ti in hot-stamped steel can increase the hydrogen trap sites and decrease the hydrogen diffusion coefficient. While Park et al. [16] proposed that the mechanical and corrosion-induced hydrogen embrittlement properties of medium C-based ultra-strong steel degraded with increasing Ni content. Hydrogen embrittlement is usually regarded as recoverable. Allen et al. [17] studied the hydrogen embrittlement of advanced high-strength steel and the recovery process of the mechanical property, they found that hydrogen concentration decreased along with storage time, and the strength of the steel recovered normally. Hardie et al. [18] cathodically charged X100 steel at 0.66 mA mm−2 and leaved it for one week at room temperature, and then found it had similar ductility to the uncharged specimens. Kim et al. [19] found that baking hot-stamped boron martensitic steel at 200 °C had the most effective impact on the recovery of elongation. However, Cialone and Asaro [20] found it was necessary to restrict currents below 0.06 mA mm−2 to avoid surface damage and associated cracking for plain carbon steels subjected to cathodic polarization, and then the ductility loss attributed to the effect of absorbed hydrogen on ductile dimpling was recoverable. Otherwise, the damage was irrecoverable. Some significant theories have been presented along with the intensive study on hydrogen embrittlement. Hydrogen-enhanced de-cohesion theory (HEDE), hydrogen pressure theory (HP), hydrogen-enhanced local plasticity (HELP) are the typical ones [1]. According to HEDE, the bonding force between atoms is considered to be reduced by hydrogen, resulting in the reduction of critical stress required for the nucleation of hydrogen-induced crack. Additionally, hydrogen-induced fracture is commonly described by HEDE. The main point of HELP theory is that the expansion and movement of dislocations are fundamentally enhanced by hydrogen energy, leading to stress concentration caused by local plastic deformation. Hydrogen-induced cracks usually occur when stress concentration level reaches a critical magnitude. Likewise, HELP is usually used to explain the hydrogen-induced plastic fracture. HP clarifies that the stress concentration within the steel is mainly caused by the generation of hydrogen molecular. Particularly, internal cavities, such as microcracks and second phase particles, are easily invaded by hydrogen atoms, where hydrogen pressure is generated after the production of hydrogen. Eventually, cracks are growing at the blister wall when the pressure has approached the critical magnitude. Simultaneously, HP theory is usually used to identify ‘fisheye’, hydrogen blistering, H2S solution immersion cracks, etc. Each of the announced theories has its application field. For example, HEDE mechanism is commonly used for brittle intergranular fracture, while HELP mechanism is correlated to the situations where shear localization bands or small dimples are present [21]. HP theory is difficult to explain the reversible plastic loss [22]. Choosing a proper theory for specific material is important. So far, the studies on hydrogen embrittlement for hot stamped high strength steel are still not deep enough, especially on its irreversibility and reversibility properties after hydrogen charging. Moreover, the influences of hydrogen charging parameters are difficult to be compared because the previous work studied them with different charging procedures and different specimens. In this paper, hydrogen was introduced into hot-stamped steel by the electrochemical hydrogen charging method. The hydrogen concentrations were well controlled by adjusting current densities, and tensile tests were carried out at a slow strain rate to obtain respective mechanical properties. Meanwhile, designated pre-strains were determined to study the effect of plastic deformation on hydrogen embrittlement. The optical microscope (OM), the scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), and electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) were employed to observe the morphology of hydrogen-induced cracks. The formation of fracture was discussed eventually to clarify the mechanism of irreversible recovery of mechanical properties after hydrogen embrittlement. For hot-stamped steel, both reversible and irreversible hydrogen induced embrittlement and their transition were firstly discussed within a unified framework, in which the influencing factors were clearly compared. Furthermore, the hydrogen induced embrittlement phenomena of hot-stamped steel were explained in a self-consistent way, where macro-mechanical properties, mesoscopic surface conditions, microstructure characteristics and crack morphology were presented and discussed successively."
1,Experimental scheme,
2,Material characteristics,"2.1 Material characteristics The hot-stamping steel B1500HS produced by Baosteel Co. was studied in this research, in which the blank thickness is 1.4 mm. Plasma emission spectrometer and high-frequency infrared carbon sulfur analyzer were employed to identify the chemical compositions of the steel, where the result is shown in Table 1 [23]. The original microstructure of the steel consists of ferrite and pearlite, as well as the critical cooling rate of martensitic transformation is 27 °C / s [24]. The martensite transformation starting temperature Ms and finishing temperature Mf are 373 °C and 235 °C, respectively. The heat treatment process was implemented according to the hot stamping process of ultra-high-strength steel. A specimen was heated to 920 °C and kept for 5 min in a furnace for full austenitization. Then, the specimen was removed from the furnace and placed in water for quenching. After these procedures, the material is called hot-stamped steel in this paper. The metallography illustrates that martensite is the major microstructure within the specimen, as shown in Fig. 1 . By using XRD method, the relative amounts of martensite and residual austenite are 98.8% and 1.2% respectively."
3,Electrochemical hydrogen charging experiment,"2.2 Electrochemical hydrogen charging experiment In this paper, an electrochemical charging method was designed to introduce hydrogen atoms into hot-stamped steel samples. All the tested specimens were designed followed by the GB standard GB/T 228–2002, the gauge length of specimens was designed as 16 mm, and the shape and dimension are shown in Fig. 2 . Before the electrochemical hydrogen charging, the oxide scale and filings were polished off by sandpaper, and different pre-strains (1%, 3%, and 5%) were selectively applied. The entire specimen was covered by insulation tape except for the gauge part. Then, the specimen was placed at the cathode of the electrolytic cell, and platinum wire was fixed at the anode. Hydrogen ions were ionized inside the electrolyte, capturing electrons at the cathode to form hydrogen atoms. During the charging process, the specimen was invaded by free hydrogen atoms. The solution mixed of 0.5 mol/L diluted H2SO4 and 1 g/L thiourea was made as the hydrogen charging electrolyte. The forming of hydrogen molecules was inhibited by thiourea, leading to a higher concentration of hydrogen atoms in the solution. In other words, the invasion of hydrogen atoms into the specimen was promoting by thiourea. The research presented by Du et al. [10] showed that the hydrogen concentration increased with current density. Therefore, in order to study the effect of concentration on the hydrogen embrittlement of B1500HS, the concentrations of hydrogen atoms were controlled by adjusting the electric currents as 0.001A, 0.01A, and 0.1A (the corresponding current densities were 0.422 mA/cm2, 4.22 mA/cm2 and 42.2 mA/cm2 respectively)."
4,Slow strain-rate tensile test,"2.3 Slow strain-rate tensile test After the electrochemical charging, the specimen was taken out from the solution and washed by alcohol, then its surface was polished quickly to avoid the influence caused by residue [25]. After that, the specimen was fixed in the Zwick/Roell Z100 tensile testing machine, and a series of slow strain-rate tensile tests (strain rate equals 10−4 under room temperature) were performed to show the mechanical properties after hydrogen charging. Each test was repeated three times under the same experimental conditions, ultimately an average value was collected."
5,Microscopic morphology and microstructure observation,"2.4 Microscopic morphology and microstructure observation The OM ‘Image A1m’ and the SEM ‘Vega LaB6-SEM’ were employed to observe the surface and cross-section of the hydrogen-charged specimens. Especially, the hydrogen blistering was found on the surface so the observation of micro-morphology and the determination of fracture characteristics are indispensable. Furthermore, EBSD was implemented by MIRA FE-SEMs to investigate the characteristics and fracture mechanism of hydrogen charging-induced cracks. Surface polish was performed when all the specimens had been mounted by metallographic inlaying machine. Regarding the specimens of OM and SEM observation, they needed to be metallographically etched with a 4% nitric acid alcohol solution to gain valuable microstructure information. Respecting to EBSD, extra vibration polish for 3 h was required to improve the surface smoothness and eliminate residual stress."

7,Mechanical properties of hydrogen-charged hot-stamped steel,"3.1 Mechanical properties of hydrogen-charged hot-stamped steel 3.1.1 Reversible and irreversible hydrogen embrittlement phenomena Two typical designated hydrogen charging conditions were involved. For the first set, the specimens without pre-stretching were charged with a low current 0.001A (corresponding to the current density of 0.422 mA/cm2) for 2 h. Regarding the second set, the specimens with a 3% pre-strain were charged with a high current 0.1A (corresponding to the current density of 42.2 mA/cm2) for 24 h. After the charging process, the specimens were removed from the electrolyte and left in the atmosphere for different storage time. In the end, the mechanical properties of the tested specimens were obtained by tensile tests. Fig. 3 and Table 2 include all the results (mean values of repeated tests) of the B1500HS samples yielded by the low current. The recovery of the strength is considered to be relatively faster because the strength of the sample has approximately approached to the original level after 4-h storage in the atmosphere. However, the recovery of elongation is relatively slow, which takes about 48 h to approach the elongation output by the uncharged specimen. A reasonable conjecture for the compared result is that the charged hydrogen exited from the tested specimen slowly but continuously. After a long enough storage time, all the hydrogen escaped and the mechanical properties of the specimen recovered completely. This type of recovery is known as reversible hydrogen embrittlement. The results yielded by the high current are shown in Table 3 and Fig. 4 . The tensile strength is only 191 MPa respecting the sample without any storage time, i.e. operating tensile test directly after finishing charging. After placing for 48 h in the atmosphere, the strength has improved back to 362 MPa and the elongation has regained to 0.4%. Nevertheless, there is no noticeable change in the mechanical properties beyond 48 h. Therefore, the mechanical property degeneration is irreversible, known as irreversible hydrogen embrittlement. Reversible hydrogen embrittlement happens at low current without pre-strain in accordance with the comparisons between the mechanical properties output by different currents. Conversely, the experimental conditions with long charging duration, high current and pre-strain induce irreversible hydrogen embrittlement. More specifically, permanent loss of mechanical properties occurs. 3.1.2 Influence of plastic deformation In practice, the plastic deformation and hardening of hot-stamping products are generally completed during the forming and quenching process. Regarding this research, plastic pre-strain was introduced into the specimens to investigate the effect of plastic deformation on hydrogen embrittlement. 0%, 1%, 3%, and 5% were the designated pre-strains, which was achieved by pre-stretching. In addition, 0.1A was the designated current, and 24 h was the charging duration. The stress-strain curves are shown in Fig. 5 , and Table 4 contains the detail values of related mechanical properties. The tensile strength is reduced along with pre-strain, where the highest stress 516 MPa is output by 0% pre-strain and the lowest stress 176 MPa is output by 5% pre-strain, as illustrated in Fig. 5(a). In the meantime, the mechanical properties recover incompletely after being left in the atmosphere for 48 h. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the strengths of specimens without pre-strain recover to 1220 MPa, and the strengths of specimens with pre-strain of 1%, 3%, and 5% recover to 1024 MPa, 362 MPa and 268 MPa, respectively. Moreover, the elongations are 1.32%, 0.90%, 0.40% and 0.37% from 0% pre-strain to 5% pre-strain, orderly. Even though the elongations regain partially respecting all tested specimens, the degree of recovery is very limited. Overall, the hydrogen embrittlement can be promoted by plastic strain, i.e. the mechanical properties of the tested specimens are aggravated. The greater the plastic deformation, the worse the mechanical properties after hydrogen charging. And the loss of mechanical properties can't recover perfectly even beyond 48 h. 3.1.3 Influence of hydrogen charging conditions The effect of hydrogen charging is essentially determined by current density and charging time during electrochemical hydrogen charging. In order to study the relationship between current densities and the recovery of mechanical properties, the tested specimens (3% pre-strain, 1 h charging duration) were charged by different currents. A 48-h storage in the atmosphere was required before operating tensile tests, where the tensile strength and elongation are shown in Table 5 . The strength and elongation of the specimen at 0.001A current recovered perfectly after storage. Regarding the result yielded by 0.01A, the strength is able to recover fully, but the elongation is not as good as the 0.001A's. However, irreversible recoveries of mechanical properties happened in consequences of 0.1A and 0.5A. Conclusively, whether the hydrogen embrittlement is irreversible or not is regulated by the current density since the hydrogen concentration is determined by the current as well. On this basis, the plastic deformation also plays an important role as discussed in the above section. 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, and 24 h are the designated durations to study the connection between the charging time and the recovery of mechanical properties. 3% pre-strain set and 0.001A current are the fix experimental parameters in this part. According to Table 6 , the mechanical properties recover completely when the charging time is 1 h and 2 h. Regarding the result yielded by 4 h charging, the properties recovered fully after 72-h storage in the atmosphere. As for the outputs from 8 h and 24 h, the properties are similar to the original steel. Accordingly, when charging at low currents, the mechanical properties recover gradually if the storage time is long enough. Ultimately, the charging duration plays no role in causing irreversible HE effects. Long charging time ensures hydrogen saturation and only extends the recovery time of the steel's mechanical properties."
8,Macro and micro morphology of hydrogen-charged hot-stamped steel,"3.2 Macro and micro morphology of hydrogen-charged hot-stamped steel 3.2.1 Hydrogen blistering and hydrogen-induced crack The surface morphology of tested specimens respecting reversible and irreversible hydrogen embrittlement is discussed in this sub-section. The reversible hydrogen embrittlement was achieved by charging the specimens for 2 h at 0.001A without pre-strain, while irreversible hydrogen embrittlement was achieved by charging the specimens for 24 h at 0.1A with a 3% pre-strain. After the charging process, the specimens were removed from the electrolyte, rinsed by alcohol, and blown dried. Eventually, OM was operated to observe the morphology of the samples. The surface morphology is shown in Fig. 6 . It is relatively smooth at the macro level when the charging process is performed at low-current. No bulge but only some traces of hydrogen blisters can be observed. Regarding the high-current charging, many blisters are found on the surface, and the sizes of them are not uniform and their distributions are irregular. Further, the OM is operated to observe the cross-sections of the tested specimen. Regarding the low-current charging process (Fig. 7(a)), the microstructure of the sample is similar to the observation of an uncharged specimen (Fig. 1). Likewise, no defects such as cracks and holes are discovered. However, cracks can be noticeably found inside the specimen respecting high-current charging, as shown in Fig. 7(b) and Fig. 7(c). According to Fig. 7(b), the crack is located near an individual hydrogen blister, where the blister is generally near the surface. Fig. 7(c) shows the cracks found at a region accumulated of hydrogen blisters, in which the cracks are generally arc-shaped and generated nearby the surface. Additionally, no defects are found in the area without hydrogen blisters. From Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, it can be found that when the low current and short charging time condition is used, there are no blisters on the surface and no cracks inside the blank, which means no damage is formed during the charging procedure. Therefore, the mechanical properties of the specimen will recover after the hydrogen dissipates from the specimen. Contrarily, when high current, long charging time and pre-strain are applied, both blisters on the surface and cracks inside the blank are generated. Thus, the irreversible damages are formed during the charging procedure, and the mechanical property of the specimen will never recover to its initial state even the hydrogen dissipates from the specimen totally after an enough long time. 3.2.2 Influence of plastic deformation on morphology The surface morphology of the tested samples yielded by different pre-strains is illustrated in Fig. 8 , in which 24 h is the total charging duration and the current is adopted as 0.1A. The quantity and size of the hydrogen blisters increase along with pre-strain. Especially, the result is consistent with the relationship between mechanical properties and pre-strain. Moreover, the cracks are found in both instances, i.e. defects are existed in both 0% pre-strain set and 3% pre-strain set, as shown in Fig. 9 . The influence of plastic deformation is not significant at the designated current, but the crack is larger when there is a pre-set of strain. For specimen without pre-strain, the charged hydrogen is mainly cluster at the interfaces of martensite lath bundles. When the specimen is stretched with plastic strain, dislocation density in the material is markedly improved [13], which means it can accommodate more hydrogen atoms. As a result, the local hydrogen enrichments induce higher sensitivity of hydrogen embrittlement, and more hydrogen-induced cracks occur [25,26]. 3.2.3 Influence of hydrogen charging conditions on morphology The surface morphology yielded by different currents is shown in Fig. 10 , where 1 h is the designated charging duration. The number of hydrogen blister (marked by yellow arrows in Fig. 10(b) and Fig. 10(c)) increases with current density. Regarding 0.001A, the surface is relatively smooth and there are a few traces of hydrogen blisters that can be noticed. The generation of hydrogen blister occurs when the charging current is up to 0.01A, but the quantity and size of the blisters are small compared with the observation of 0.1A. The distribution characteristics and principles of cracks at cross-section are similar to the illustration in Fig. 7. Fig. 11 shows the surface morphology yielded by the condition of 3% pre-strain and 0.1A, in which the hydrogen charging duration is variable. (The morphology of the specimens charged for 1 h and 24 h has been respectively shown in Fig. 10(c) and Fig. 8(c)). Small-size hydrogen blisters can be found on the surface of the tested specimen after 1 min hydrogen charging. Regarding 10 min charging, more hydrogen blisters are generated, as well as the size of the blister is larger. When the charging time is up to 30 min, the number of the large-size blister is more than which found in the 10 min case. Fig. 12 shows the crack morphology output with 1 h charging time at 0.1A current. Comparing to Fig. 9(b) with 2 h charging time at the same current, the crack induced after longer charging time seems longer and deeper. The research presented by Depover et al. [11] showed that the total hydrogen concentration and the free hydrogen concentration in the hot-stamped steel increase with the extension of hydrogen charging duration, but approaches balance in the end. More specifically, the reversible or irreversible recovery of mechanical properties is independent of the charging time. According to the hydrogen pressure theory [27,28], the cracks caused by hydrogen pressure are generated when the hydrogen concentration in the specimen is high enough, in other words, the current density has approached a certain critical value. Furthermore, the generation and expansion of cracks are promoted by the hydrogen pressure energy due to the ongoing quantity of hydrogen atoms and the forming of hydrogen molecules. Thus, the quantity and size of hydrogen blisters are larger at higher current densities."
9,Microscopic analysis of hydrogen charging-induced cracks,"3.3 Microscopic analysis of hydrogen charging-induced cracks Fig. 13 illustrates the SEM images of the hydrogen charging-induced cracks morphology at a charging current of 0.1A. Fig. 13(a)–(c) are cracks discovered at the cross-section along the pre-strain loading direction, the cross-section perpendicular to the pre-strain loading direction, and the upper surface of the observed area, respectively. In the meantime, the prior austenite grain boundaries are represented by the white dash lines. As going through Fig. 13, the observations revealed by (a) and (b) are similar, in which the cracks are nucleated at the prior austenite grain boundary or lath martensite interface. At the same time, the fractures are propagated along with the orientation of martensite lath bundles perpendicularly. Besides, single crack penetrating through the grains and crack branching can be noticed on both cross-sections. The cracks detected at the upper region (similar to the lower surface) are in a zigzag shape, with a relatively flat region. The EBSD observation results are illustrated in Fig. 14 . The whole prior austenite grain is penetrated by hydrogen charging-induced cracks, as well as the trans-granular fractures are remarkable. It's obvious that the direction of the cracks propagates perpendicularly to the orientation of lath martensite."
10,Discussion,"Based on the experimental results indicated in previous sections, irreversible hydrogen embrittlement occurs when the hot-stamped steel is charged at high current, and the generation of cracks is associated with the existence of hydrogen blisters. Moreover, the formation of hydrogen blisters is more frequent with longer charging duration and higher pre-strain. Ultimately, HP and HEDE theories are proper and sufficient to define the hydrogen embrittlement of the B1500HS steel at high hydrogen charging current. According to HP theory, the hydrogen pressure is generated by the production of hydrogen molecules, which are formed by free hydrogen atoms clustering at defects. In addition, these defects are enriched by hydrogen because of the effect of stress-induced diffusion. As a result, the hydrogen pressure is raised gradually by the increasing quantity of diatomic hydrogen. Simultaneously, the atomic bonding force is reduced by the existence of hydrogen in accordance with the HEDE theory. When the stress or stress intensity factor caused by the internal pressure of hydrogen blisters is equal to or less than the atomic bonding force, the microcracks are nucleated at the blister wall and propagated in the direction which is perpendicular to lath martensite. A schematic diagram is created and shown in Fig. 15 , including the nucleation and propagation processes of hydrogen charging-induced cracks. Hydrogen atoms (marked by red dots) gradually diffuse into martensite during hydrogen charging and then cluster at defects such as the prior austenite grain boundaries and the interfaces of martensite lath bundles with different orientations to form hydrogen molecules and generate hydrogen pressure. The nucleation of hydrogen charging-induced cracks (marked by purple area) begins when the hydrogen pressure has reached to a critical magnitude. Concurrently, the directions of cracks are propagated along with the orientation of lath martensite perpendicularly, showing obvious characteristics of trans-granular fracture."
11,Conclusions,"The research of the hydrogen embrittlement of the hot-stamped ultra-high-strength steel B1500HS was presented in this paper. The hydrogen embrittlement and the recovery of mechanical properties respecting different hydrogen concentrations were investigated via the electrochemical hydrogen charging method and slow strain-rate tensile test. Moreover, the influence of plastic pre-strain was also investigated. The surface condition and the morphology of hydrogen-induced crack were observed and discussed based on the consequences of microscopic observations. Furthermore, the formation and evolution process of hydrogen-induced cracks were also explained by HP and HEDE theories. The main conclusions are listed as follows: (1) The recovery process of mechanical properties is extremely dominated by hydrogen concentration. The mechanical properties are able to recover completely when the hydrogen concentration is relatively low. On the contrary, the irreversible situation of hydrogen embrittlement happens when the concentration of hydrogen is relatively high, i.e. permanent loss of the properties happens. (2) Hydrogen blisters and cracks are generated respectively at external and internal of the samples in the surrounding of high hydrogen concentration. Moreover, the hydrogen embrittlement of the specimen is more serious when a larger pre-strain is applied. In particular, the existence of the blister and crack indicates that the type of hydrogen embrittlement is irreversible. (3) Hydrogen charging-induced cracks are generally grown at the prior austenite grain boundaries and the lath martensite interfaces. The directions of the cracks are propagated perpendicularly along the orientation of lath martensite, and the characteristics of trans-granular fracture are evident."
