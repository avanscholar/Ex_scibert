0,Introduction,"Selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde is a crucial process (Mallat and Baiker, 2004; Zhang et al., 2012; Sankar et al., 2020; Groppo et al., 2018) because the product benzaldehyde is immensely valuable in organic synthesis (Vinod, et al., 2011; Xu, 1996; Torbina et al., 2018). Considerable advances have been made in the field, involving the use of stochiometric oxidants such as TBHP (tert-butyl hydroperoxide) (Sarmah et al., 2010; Frija et al., 2017), hydrogen peroxide (Guo and Li, 2007; Jing et al., 2013; Cang et al., 2015), etc. (Yadav and Krishnan, 1999; Xiao et al., 2019; Di Somma et al., 2017; Cerdan et al., 2019) leading to environmental problems and high costs. From the viewpoints of the environment and cost, molecular oxygen is the most desirable oxidant for catalytic oxidation (Ji et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2018; Li et al., 2017). The activization of dioxygen, the key step of aerobic oxidation of alcohol (Ma et al., 2019), alkene (Eisenberg et al., 2018; Denekamp et al., 2018) and ester (Zhang et al., 2020) had been solved to a certain extent in the presence of metals particles on active supports. Hence, various catalytic systems such as ruthenium (Al-Rifai et al., 2016; Ji et al., 2007; Han et al., 2020), cobalt (Yang et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018), manganese (Meng et al., 2013; Fu et al., 2017), etc. (Satrio and Doraiswamy, 2002) have been developed for the selective aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Although immense progress for the selective aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol has been reported, most of the catalytic oxidation procedures have been conducted in a bubble column on the laboratory scale (Liu et al., 2017; Kobayashi et al., 2006; Olenin et al., 2018). In a bubble column reactor, the catalytic efficiency is adversely affected by the gas-liquid mass transfer, which limits its industrial implementation (Ide et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018). Hence, the aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol in the continuous flow mode is significant for the large-scale preparation of benzaldehyde (Wu and Wang, 2003; Rebrov et al., 2012; Vina-Gonzalez et al., 2019). In recent years, several researchers have focused on the use of a microchannel due to its wide applications in the chemical industry, such as in organic synthesis (Schonfeld et al., 2004; Hu et al., 2018; Zeng et al., 2018; Tabakova, 2019), nanomaterial preparation (Othman et al., 2015; Sharaf et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2013), and industrial catalytic oxidation (Bawornruttanaboonya et al., 2017; Venkateswaran et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Dai et al., 2019; Snytnikov et al., 2010). A plug-flow model is utilized to describe the fluid flow in the micro-channel with a diameter of only 10–1000 μm. The hydromechanical characteristics of the fluid in the microchannel reactor change remarkably compared with those in the bubble column reactor. This special structure exhibits unique benefits: The reaction time and temperature can be precisely controlled; prompt mixing can be realized in the presence of a micro-mixed element; and uniform mass and heat transfer can be achieved in the microchannel (Shen et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2021). Among these approaches, membrane reactors are attracting immense attention due to their well-defined contact interface between the gas and liquid phases. A mesh-supported Teflon AF-2400 membrane has been used for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol using molecular oxygen over Au-Pd/TiO2 heterogeneous catalyst. In a flat-membrane microchannel packed-bed reactor, a benzyl alcohol conversion and benzaldehyde selectivity of 70% and 71%, respectively, have been reported under an oxygen pressure of 8.4 bar and a liquid pressure of 10 bar (Wu et al., 2019a). Owing to the unique excellent chemical resistance and thermal stability of Teflon AF-2400 membranes, the aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol over a Ru/Al2O3 catalyst is efficiently achieved using such a membrane microchannel reactor (Wu et al., 2019b). Meanwhile, metalloporphyrins have been widely used for the selective aerobic oxidation of organic compounds, such as alkanes, alkenes, and alcohols, etc. in the presence of aldehyde as a co-reductant (Nesterova et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2019; Bugnola et al., 2020; Li et al., 2012; Jiang et al., 2018; Mukherjee and Dey, 2019). Our group has even reported the selective oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds over ruthenium porphyrins with isobutyraldehyde as the oxygen activator in a batch bubble column reactor (Ji et al., 2007; Zhou and Ji, 2012). However, there are still a limited number of studies on the selective aerobic oxidation of alcohols by metalloporphyrins in a continuous microchannel reactor. Thus, our group decided to investigate the selective aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde over cobalt porphyrin in a membrane microchannel reactor to examine the feasibility of a continuous flow reactor. In addition, the mechanism for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol was proposed via in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and in situ UV–visible spectroscopy. Notably, a mathematical kinetic model for the membrane microchannel reactor was proposed, which can be beneficial to process optimization and reactor design."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Benzyl alcohol (99.5%), benzaldehyde (99.5%), benzoic acid (99.5%), N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN), and isobutyraldehyde (99.9%) were purchased from J&K Scientific (Beijing). Isobutyraldehyde was redistilled before use. Analytical-grade solvent (1,2-dichloroethane, DCE) and other reagents were used without further purification. Cobalt meso-tetraphenylporphyrin (CoTPP) was synthesized according to a previously reported procedure (Zhou and Ji, 2010). MALDI-TOF of CoTPP (CH2Cl2) [C44H28CoN4]: m/z = 671.5 (exp.), m/z = 671.2 (cal.). UV–vis (CH2Cl2) λmax (nm): 465 (Soret band), 590 (Q band). IR: 1638 cm−1, 1001 cm−1, 741 cm−1 (Figs. S1–S3)."
3,Equipment and experimental procedures.,"2.2 Equipment and experimental procedures. Fig. 1 shows the schematic overview of the experimental setup. The solution containing benzyl alcohol, solvent A (DCE), and the catalyst was delivered by a continuous syringe pump at a flow rate of 2 mL/min (Liquid A). Isobutyraldehyde and solvent B (DCE) were delivered by a continuous syringe pump at a flow rate of 2 mL/min (Liquid B). Liquid A and B were mixed in a T-mixer. Then, the gas and liquid phases were pumped into a membrane microchannel reactor (Vapourtec E, England). Two phases channel were separated using a semipermeable membrane, which permitted the passage of oxygen molecules to the liquid phase. The temperature of the membrane microchannel reactor was monitored by an air heating channel. The oxidation of benzyl alcohol was performed in the membrane microchannel reactor, which was assumed to be a plug-flow reactor. The reaction residence time could be precisely controlled by the solution flow rate."
4,Methodology,"2.3 Methodology Operando characterization such as EPR spectroscopy and in-situ UV–Vis spectroscopy was conducted under the reaction conditions according to our previous studies (Zhou et al., 2020). The conversion of benzyl alcohol, consumption of isobutyraldehyde, and formation of products were monitored by GC and GC-MS. GC analyses were performed on a Shimadzu GC-2010 Plus chromatography system equipped with anRtx-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm). GC-MS analyses were performed on a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 system equipped with a Rxi-5 ms capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm). The CSI-MS spectrometer were obtained on Bruker's timsTOF, and the cold jet is Bruker's CryoSpray. The IR spectra were obtained on a Bruker 550 spectrometer. The UV–vis spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer. The rate of reaction was determined by the slope of the curve of the benzyl alcohol residual concentration at different time intervals. The reaction order was obtained by the initial concentration method. All kinetic rate constants were reproducible within an experimental error of ±5%."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol,"3.1 Catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol Fig. 2 shows the reaction profiles for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol catalyzed by CoTPP in the presence of isobutyraldehyde and molecular oxygen. In particular, oxidation was effective in the membrane microchannel reactor. By conducting the reaction in only 6.5 min, the conversion of benzyl alcohol reached 82%. As shown in Fig. 2, during the first 390 s, the conversion of benzyl alcohol was increased continually, meanwhile the selectivity of benzaldehyde and benzoic acid were stable at 94–96% and 4–6% respectively. It was suggested that benzyl alcohol was mostly oxidized to benzaldehyde continually during the period. As the oxidation proceed, the generation of benzoic acid was observed over 480 s. It could be attributed to the deep oxidation of benzaldehyde. Compared with that observed for the benzyl alcohol oxidation in a bubble column reactor [19], the efficiency was considerably improved, indicating that the membrane microchannel reactor is effective in achieving a rapid gas-liquid mass transfer rate and high mixing performance."
7,Effect of temperature on benzyl alcohol oxidation,"3.2 Effect of temperature on benzyl alcohol oxidation The effect of the reaction temperature in this membrane microchannel reactor was examined. Fig. 3 showed that the oxidation was greatly influenced by the reaction temperature. With increasing temperature, the conversion of benzyl alcohol was increased. And the selectivity of benzaldehyde was almost at 96%. However, the deep oxidation of benzaldehyde was observed when the reaction temperature was over 65 °C. When the reaction was conducted at 75 °C, the selectivity for benzoic acid reached up to 27%. There were the temperature control units in membrane microchannel reactor. Temperature was controlled in set point by air heating and cooling. The temperature profiles of the reactor along reaction time was shown in Fig. 4 . It could be observed that the temperature in reactor during the reaction was stable at 65.0 °C. Therefore, reactor system could be considered as isothermal conditions."
8,Effect of the amount of catalyst and isobutyraldehyde,"3.3 Effect of the amount of catalyst and isobutyraldehyde Subsequently, the effect of the CoTPP catalyst amount on the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol was examined in the membrane microchannel reactor. In the control experiment of the catalyst (entry 1 in Table 1 ), a benzyl alcohol conversion of only 8% was obtained, possibly because a high catalyst concentration led to the improvement in the benzyl alcohol conversion. However, an extremely high catalyst concentrations was conducive to the deep oxidation of benzaldehyde (entries 2–7 in Table 1). In the catalytic oxidation by metal complexes, isobutyraldehyde was used as a co-substrate to activate dioxygen via the generation of acyl radicals. Therefore, the efficiency of oxidation can be affected by the isobutyraldehyde amount. In the absence of isobutyraldehyde, 10% benzyl alcohol was converted to benzaldehyde with excellent selectivity (entry 8 in Table 1). With the increase in the isobutyraldehyde amount, the conversion increased (entries 9–13 in Table 1). At an isobutyraldehyde concentration of greater than 0.92 mol/L, the conversion did not distinctly improve. Moreover, an excess amount of isobutyraldehyde can result in the decreased selectivity of benzaldehyde. To examine whether benzaldehyde as the product exhibits the same oxygen activation role as isobutryaldehyde, the oxidation of benzyl alcohol was conducted in the presence of benzaldehyde (entry 14 in Table 1). The same efficiency as that obtained in the control experiment of isobutyraldehyde was observed (entry 8 in Table 1), indicating that benzaldehyde is more inert than isobutyraldehyde for oxygen activation."
9,Plausible mechanism for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol,"3.4 Plausible mechanism for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol To explore the mechanism for the aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol in the presence of CoTPP and isobutyraldehyde in the membrane microchannel reactor, some operando characterization techniques such as in situ EPR and UV–vis spectroscopy were performed. in situ EPR spectra were recorded during the oxidation of benzyl alcohol at a microwave frequency of 9.05 GHz. Benzyl alcohol, catalyst, and DCE were added in a Wilmad WG-810-A quartz-flat cell. First, the mixture in the cell was sealed after filling CO2 and heated at 65 °C. EPR signals were not observed under CO2 atmosphere without calefaction (Fig. 5 a), indicating that free radicals are absent in the blank of isobutyraldehyde. Then, isobutyraldehyde was added into the reaction system with heating to 65 °C under CO2 atmosphere, generating a stable DMPO radical adduct (⋅, aN = 1.46 mT) (Fig. 5b). Therefore, this free radical is known to be generated from isobutyraldehyde. Previous studies have reported that this free radical is possibly related to the acyl radical, which is generated from the dehydrogenation of isobutyraldehyde by calefaction. Subsequently, the CO2 atmosphere was replaced by molecular oxygen under the same conditions as described above, and another stable DMPO radical peak adduct was obtained (♣, aN = 0.80 mT) (Fig. 5c). Acyl radical is a type of active species, which can rapidly react with dioxygen. Hence, this adduct can be assigned tothe peroxyl radical. Fig. 6 shows the time courses of in situ EPR spectra for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol catalyzed by CoTPP in the presence of isobutyraldehyde and molecular oxygen. With the progress of the reaction, the radical transformation from the acyl radical to peroxyl radical was confirmed. By prolonging the reaction even up to 10 min, the acyl radical concentration marginally changed. However, the peroxyl radical concentrationwas significantly high. Hence, the consumption of peroxyl radical can be reasonably concluded to be a limited step for benzyl alcohol oxidation. Oxidation catalyzed by metalloporphyrins occurred by the oxygen atom-transfer (OAT) mechanism via high-valent species (Sharma et al., 2018; Cho et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2020). The intermediate formed during oxidation can be characterized by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy. Fig. 7 shows the time courses of the in situ UV–vis spectrum for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol under the given reaction conditions. In the initial reaction period, a clear absorption peak at 465 nm (Soret band) was observed, corresponding to CoIITPP. With the progress of oxidation, the absorption peak gradually decreased, accompanied with the gradual increase in a new absorption peak at 486 nm. This peak corresponded to cobalt high-valent species (CoIII = OTPP), indicative of the combination between peroxyl radical and CoIITPP. Based on the above discussion, the mechanism for the aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol by CoIITPP and isobutyraldehyde in a membrane microchannel reactor was proposed (Fig. 8 ). The dehydrogenation of isobutyraldehyde to the acyl radical primarily occurred under reaction conditions (a). Then, one oxygen molecule combined with the acyl radical to generate a peroxyl radical (b). Subsequently, CoIII = OTPP (d) was generated by the combination of peroxyl acid(c) and CoIITPP. The formation of benzaldehyde corresponded to the reaction between benzyl alcohol and CoIII = OTPP, followed by β-hydride elimination(pathway A). The catalyst blank exhibited a conversion of 8% (entry 1 in Table 1), corresponding to the reaction between peroxyl acid and benzyl alcohol (pathway B)."
10,Kinetic studies,"3.5 Kinetic studies To eliminate the influence of mass transfer in the membrane microchannel reactor, oxidation was conducted under various oxygen flows from 0.5 to 3.8 mL/min. The oxygen flow exerted a slight effect on the reaction (Fig. S4). Because the membrane microchannel is a type of reactor that can considerably improve the gas-liquid mass-transfer efficiency, the gas-liquid mass transfer in the reactor can be eliminated. Fig. 9 plots a typical concentration profile for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol catalyzed by CoTPP in the membrane microchannel reactor. Almost 4 equivalents of isobutyraldehyde was consumed to obtain 1 equivalent of benzaldehyde. Therefore, the autooxidation of isobutyraldehyde under the reaction conditions cannot be excluded. In the presence of isobutyraldehyde and molecular oxygen in the membrane microchannel reactor, the oxidation of two substrates, i.e., benzyl alcohol and isobutyraldehyde, respectively, was catalyzed by cobalt porphyrin. Following the reaction mechanism shown in Fig. 8, the reaction equations were listed as below: Radical-chain initiation: (1) i P r C H O → k 1 + i P r C O · + H . Radical-chain propagation: (2) i P r C O · + O 2 → k 2 i P r C O 3 (3) i P r C O 3 · + i P r C H O → k 3 i P r C O 3 H + i P r C O · (4) P o r C o I I + i P r C O 3 H → k 4 P o r C o I I I = O + i P r C O O H (5) i P r C O 3 H + P h C H 2 O H → k 5 i P r C O O H + P h C H O (6) P o r C o I I I = O + P h C H 2 O H → k 6 P o r C o I I + P h C H O (7) i P r C O 3 H + i P r C H O → k 7 2 i P r C O O H (8) P o r C o I I I = O + i P r C H O → k 8 P o r C o I I + i P r C O O H Radical-chain termination: (9) H . + i P r C O · → k 9 i n a c t i v e (10) 2 i P r C O · → k 11 i n a c t i v e According to the reaction equations Eqs. (1)–(10), the molar balance equations for the free-radical component can be expressed as shown in Eqs. (11)–(14). The system was assumed to be in the pseudo-steady-state, and the production of the free-radical component was balanced by its consumption. Therefore, the reaction rate for the free-radical component is zero. (11) d i P r C O · d t = k 1 i P r C H O - k 2 i P r C O · O 2 + k 3 i P r C O 3 · i P r C H O - k 11 i P r C O · 2 = 0 (12) d i P r C O 3 · d t = k 2 i P r C O · O 2 - k 3 i P r C O 3 · i P r C H O = 0 d i P r C O 3 H d t = k 3 i P r C O 3 · i P r C H O - k 4 [ P o r C o I I ] i P r C O 3 H - k 5 i P r C O 3 H [ P h C H 2 O H ] (13) - k 7 i P r C O 3 H i P r C H O = 0 d P o r C o I I I = O d t = k 4 [ P o r C o I I ] i P r C O 3 H - k 6 [ P o r C o I I I = O ] P h C H 2 O H (14) - k 8 [ P o r C o I I I = O ] i P r C H O = 0 According to the dynamitic model of deriving, the generation rate of benzaldehyde could be derived as shown in Eq. (15). (15) d P h C H O dt = k 5 + k 4 k 6 [ P o r C o II ] k 6 PhCH 2 O H + k 8 i P r C H O k 2 k 1 k 11 1 2 O 2 [ i P r C H O ] 1 2 PhCH 2 O H k 4 [ P o r C o II ] + k 5 PhCH 2 O H + k 7 i P r C H O In the catalytic reaction system, the amount of catalyst (ProCoII) was about one-thousandth that of the other reagents. Hence, the concentrations of the catalyst (ProCoⅡ) and high-valent species (ProCoIII = O) can be negligible. Then, the generation rate of benzaldehyde can be simplified as shown in Eq. (16). (16) d P h C H O d t = - k 2 k 5 ( k 1 k 11 ) 1 2 O 2 i P r C H O 1 2 P h C H 2 O H P h C H 2 O H + k 7 k 5 i P r C H O Under the reaction conditions, oxygen was continuously fed, indicating that the O2 concentration remains constant during the reaction. Then, K1 is defined as follows: (17) K 1 = - k 2 k 5 k 1 k 11 1 2 O 2 (18) K 2 = k 7 k 5 Therefore, the generation rate of benzaldehyde can be derived as shown in Eq. (19). (19) d P h C H O d t = K 1 i P r C H O 1 2 P h C H 2 O H P h C H 2 O H + K 2 i P r C H O From Eq. (19), the generation rate of benzaldehyde was related to the concentrations of benzyl alcohol and isobutyraldehyde. From the above discussion, the amount of isobutyraldehyde was considerably greater than that of benzyl alcohol, and a marginal amount of isobutyraldehyde is consumed for participation in oxidation, indicating that the isobutyraldehyde concentration remains constant during the reaction. Consequently, the reaction rate for different reactant concentrations was examined (Fig. 10 a). The reaction rate constants were obtained by the initial concentration method (Figs. S5– S10, Table S1). The activation energy (Ea ) was calculated by Arrhenius equation fitting, and its value was 70.3 kJ/mol (Fig. S11–12 ). The oxidation of benzyl alcohol was found to be a first-order reaction at a low substrate concentration. However, with the increase in the concentrations of benzyl alcohol in the range of 0.6–1.0 mol/L, the benzyl alcohol concentration exhibited a negative linear relationship with reaction time (Fig. S13), indicating that the reaction rate does not change with the reactant concentrations. Moreover, at high substrate concentrations, the reaction rate was almost zero order. Therefore, the obtained kinetic equation (Eq. (19)) is comparable to the Michaelis–Menten-type kinetics from expression Eq. (20), (20) 1 v = K m v max 1 [ S ] + 1 v max where v and [S] represent the reaction rate and benzyl alcohol concentration of catalytic oxidation, respectively. vmax represents the maximum reaction rate with a specific catalyst concentration. In enzyme-catalyzed reactions, Km represents the magnitude of the affinity between the enzyme and reactant. With the decrease in Km , the affinity increases. Next, the steady-state kinetic model of the catalytic system was evaluated by the Lineweaver–Burk plot. The reaction rate (v) was determined via the reducing concentration of benzyl alcohol ([S]). A good linear relationship was obtained for 1/v versus 1/[S] (Fig. 10b). The slope and intercept of the plot revealed a νmax of 0.00272 mol⋅L−1⋅min−1 and a Km of 0.133 mol⋅L−1. The Km value is far less than that for H2O2 catalase (Km = 1.1 mol⋅L−1) in living organisms, indicating that there is a strong affinity between the cobalt porphyrin catalyst and benzyl alcohol in this catalytic oxidation. Hence, the kinetic behavior for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol follows the Michaelis–Menten kinetics. The kinetic model for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol catalyzed by cobalt porphyrin in the presence of isobutyraldehyde in the membrane microchannel reactor is expressed as shown in Eq. (21). (21) v = 0.00272 S 0.133 + S The obtained kinetic model for biomimetic catalytic oxidation was verified with different initial concentrations of benzyl alcohol. The lines fitted the experimental data extremely well for a low initial concentration of benzyl alcohol (Fig. 11). However, at a higher initial concentration of benzyl alcohol, the experimental data were not in good agreement with the calculated data. When the initial concentration of benzyl alcohol was greater than 0.80 mol/L, a substantial deviation was observed between the experimental data and predicted data using the existing Michaelis–Menten kinetics, possibly related to the negligible effect of isobutyraldehyde on the reaction rate. As discussed above, the isobutyraldehyde concentration significantly affected the generation rate of benzaldehyde. Hence, the isobutyraldehyde concentration could not be regarded as a constant in the kinetic model. The model derived from the mechanism includes the variable of the isobutyraldehyde concentration (Eq. (19)). By the comparison of Eq. (19) and Eq. (21), (22) v m a x = 0.00272 = K 1 i P r C H O 1 2 , K m = 0.133 = K 2 i P r C H O Therefore, K1 and Km can be determined on the basis of the benzyl alcohol and isobutyraldehyde concentrations during the reaction. For example, the measured benzyl alcohol concentration was 0.25 mol/L, and the isobutyraldehyde concentration was 1.21 mol/L. Accordingly, K1 = 0.0025, K2 = 0.1099 mol/L. Hence, Eq. (23) is rewritten as follows: (23) v = 0.0025 i P r C H O 1 2 P h C H 2 O H P h C H 2 O H + 0.1099 i P r C H O Then, the modified kinetic model for biomimetic catalytic oxidation was verified with different initial concentrations of benzyl alcohol. The lines fitted the experimental data very well irrespective of the low and high benzyl alcohol concentrations (Fig. 12). Therefore, this mathematical model can predict the reaction process in a wide range of benzyl alcohol concentrations, which can serve as a reference to design a pilot reactor and for the optimization of a process."
11,Mass transfer,"3.6 Mass transfer To definite the gas-liquid mass transfer effect in the membrane micro-channel reactor, liquid-film mass transfer coefficients (kLa) was calculated by Eq. (24) and its parameter calculation was shown in Table 2 . (24) N O 2 = k L a · C ∗ - C 0 = v 1 - v 2 V The kLa value changed with air flow was shown in Fig. 13 . It was found that the liquid-film mass transfer coefficients in the membrane micro-channel reactor were in the range of 318–666 min−1. Instead it was just in the range of 12–81 min−1 in bubble column. The enormous difference between the two reactors showed the advantages in gas-liquid mass transfer of membrane micro-channel reactor. Membrane micro-channel reactor could provide more gas-liquid contact area, which was conducive to the diffusion of oxygen in liquid film."
12,Conclusion,"In conclusion, the selective aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol catalyzed by cobalt porphyrin was performed in a membrane microchannel reactor. The efficiency for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol performed in a microstructured chemical system improved the efficiency in a short reaction time. Based on the results obtained from experiments as well as in situ EPR and UV–vis spectra, a plausible mechanism for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol catalyzed by cobalt porphyrin in presence of isobutyraldehyde was proposed. Furthermore, kinetic studies revealed that the oxidation of benzyl alcohol follows the Michaelis–Menten kinetics, with Km = 0.133 mol/L. The low Km value represented the strong affinity between the catalyst and benzyl alcohol. A mathematic kinetic model was proposed, and the kinetic model fitted the experimental data well. The mathematical model can predict the reaction process in a wide range of benzyl alcohol concentrations, which is beneficial for the process optimization and reactor design."
