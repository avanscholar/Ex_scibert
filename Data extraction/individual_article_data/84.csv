0,Introduction,"Developing clean and renewable energy is a way to resolve energy shortages and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Hydrogen (H2) is known as a clean energy source with high energy density, heating value, and energy conversion [1–3]. The photocatalytic hydrogen production under solar light irradiation is regarded as a sustainable and environmentally friendly way to generate green energy because it is simple to implement and non-polluting [4]. When photocatalysts are irradiated by the light with energy higher than or equal to the band gap energy of photocatalyst, it will form electron-hole pair [5–7]. The photo-excited electrons of a semiconductor transfer from the valence band to the conduction band and reduce water to generate hydrogen [8,9]. To maximize the use of solar energy, which is regarded as renewable natural resource, photocatalysts must increase their absorption efficiency in the visible light, which accounts for 45% of solar energy. Therefore, solar light-responsive photocatalysts play an important role in the hydrogen evolution of photocatalytic processes [10–13]. The general separation methods in reusing photocatalysts include filtration and centrifugation. These methods are complicated, expensive, and time-consuming; moreover, the photocatalyst is lost in the process of recycling—resulting in secondary pollutants and a low reutilization rate [14,15]. Thus, difficulties in recycling photocatalysts limit their practical application. An effective and promising way to overcome the limitations in the application of photocatalytic processes is to fix the photocatalysts in solid carriers such as glass or stainless steel plates, ceramics, and polymer membranes [16–18]. However, some carriers have difficulties with low light transmittance and physical combination, leading to low photocatalytic activity and recovery efficiency. A polymer membrane with high light transmittance should be selected as the carrier because of different advantages such as flexibility, recyclability, and affordability; it can also solve the problem of low light transmittance [19–21]. Developing a chemical interaction between the photocatalyst and polymer membrane, instead of a physical combination, is regarded as an effective method to immobilize the photocatalyst. This substantially decreases the probability of losing photocatalysts during the photocatalytic processes [22,23]. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is widely used as a membrane substrate, binder, and emulsifying agent because of its good film-forming, hydrophilicity, nontoxicity, biocompatibility, and chemical stability properties [24–27]. Moreover, PVA can effectively combine with TiO2 through the titanium-oxygen carbon-bonds (TiOC), which act as an electron transfer pathway, thereby decreasing the rate of loss of the photocatalysts [28]. However, the photocatalyst and solution of the dense PVA membrane has low contact. To address this, previous researches prepared porous PVA film with high surface and volume ratio. Song et al. [29] synthesized porous PVA-titanium dioxide (P-PVA-TiO2) using freeze-drying. The results showed that the P-PVA-TiO2 composites enhanced theeffective visible light absorption, and the degradation efficiency of the phenol increased with increasing contact efficiency between the film and photocatalyst enhanced due to the porous structure. Compare to the freeze-drying method of preparing porous film, adding inorganic materials and etching by a specific solvent that was a simple operation and low energy consumption method. Shi and Li [30] prepared the porous PVA-TiO2 by synthesizing a PVA-titanium oxide-calcium carbonate (PVA-TiO2-CaCO3) film and etched with CaCO3 using hydrochloric acid. The results showed that the photocatalytic efficiency of the porous PVA-TiO2 film was higher than that of the nonporous film. Hashim et al. [31] added silicon dioxide (SiO2) to poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membrane and etched SiO2 using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrofluoric acid to make porous PVDF membrane. Moreover, SiO2 particle was viewed as the most widely used inorganic materials, and their particle size can be controlled by synthesis parameters, such as silica sources, ammonia/water ratios, alcohol type, synthesis temperature, and synthesis time [32–34]. Moreover, the porous PVA films with adjustable pore size were rarely reported for the H2 production. Hence, to build a photocatalyst film with excellent recycling and photocatalytic efficiency, we designed a PVA photocatalyst film with an adjustable pore size for the photocatalytic hydrogen production under simulated sunlight. In this study, a Pt/N-TiO2/SrTiO3 composite was used as a solar light-responsive photocatalyst and the SiO2 with adjustable particle size was used as the pore-forming agent. The porous PVA/Pt/NT/STO film was prepared by etching the SiO2 of different particle sizes with NaOH to form different pore sizes in the film. The effects of the alcohol solvent, synthesis time for different SiO2 particle sizes, and SiO2 concentration on the pore numbers of the film were investigated in this study. Furthermore, the morphology, light transmittance, and charge separation of the porous PVA/Pt/NT/STO films were studied in detail."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Synthesis of SiO2 particles,"2.1 Synthesis of SiO2 particles The SiO2 particles were synthesized using the Stöber method in which the hydrolysis and condensation of the tetraethyl orthosilicate were carried out in alcohol and ammonia solutions [35]. First, 21 mL tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) was added into the mixed solution containing 15.5 mL deionized water, 15.5 mL ammonium hydroxide (Union Chemical Works Ltd., ≥28%), and 82 mL alcohol solvent. The alcohol solvents used were isopropanol (J.T. Baker, 99.9%), ethanol (J.T. Baker, 99.9%). The mixed solution was stirred with different periods (5 h, 10 h, and 20 h). The solution was washed several times with deionized water and ethanol, separated by centrifugation, and then dried in an oven at 90 °C. Thereafter, the precipitate was grounded, and the obtained particles were named SiO2-x-y, where x is an alcohol solvent, such as methanol (M), ethanol (E), and isopropanol (I), and y is the synthesis time."
3,Synthesis of PVA/Pt/NT/STO porous films,"2.2 Synthesis of PVA/Pt/NT/STO porous films 2.5 wt% Pt/N-TiO2/SrTiO3 (Pt/NT/STO), which was developed in our previous study [36] and the as-prepared SiO2 were added into the 20 mL deionized water under ultrasound sonication for 1 h. Next, PVA (Sigma-Aldrich, Mw 85,000–124,000, 99+% hydrolyzed) was dissolved in the solution and stirred at 90 °C for 3 h and then continuously stirred at 60 °C for several hours. The precursor solution was treated under ultrasound sonication to remove gas bubbles, and the solution was cast onto a glass plate using a 250 µm casting knife and dried at approximately 25 °C and 50% constant humidity overnight. The dried PVA/Pt/NT/STO film was detached from the glass plate. Finally, the PVA/Pt/NT/STO-SiO2 film was annealed under vacuum at 160 °C for 2 h. The as-prepared film was cut into 2 cm × 2 cm pieces and put in 2 M NaOH (Union Chemical Works Ltd., 95%) solution for 3 h to etch the SiO2. The film was cleaned several times using deionized water and dried at approximately 25 °C and 50% constant humidity. The prepared porous film was named PVA/Pt/NT/STO-xS-y-z, where x is the concentration of SiO2, y is the alcohol solvent, and z is the synthesis time of the SiO2. The detailed preparation conditions and names of each porous film are shown in Table 1 . The dense PVA/Pt/NT/STO film was synthesized using the same method without adding SiO2. The detailed information included chemical formula, supplier, purity, and structural formula of all chemical reagents used in this study were list in the Table S1 (Supplementary data)."
4,Photocatalytic activity test,"2.3 Photocatalytic activity test The as-prepared PVA/Pt/NT/STO-SiO2 porous film and 15% (v/v) methanol solution (50 mL) were added to the cylindrical reactor. The cooling system was controlled at 20 °C, and a xenon lamp that simulated sunlight (XHA500, 312 W/m2) was fixed 20 cm above the reactor. Before the photocatalytic activity test, the suspension was deaerated by purging the nitrogen gas in the dark for 30 min. The H2 was sampled every 10 min to calculate its concentration using an online gas chromatograph (GC-TCD, Clarus 500 Perkin Elmer)."
5,Photocatalyst characterization analysis,"2.4 Photocatalyst characterization analysis The morphologies of the SiO2 particles and films were analyzed with field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JSM-6700F, JEOL) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2100, JEOL). The light transmittance of the porous film was examined via ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis, Lambda 35, Perkin Elmer). Furthermore, a photoluminescence spectrometer (PL, Perkin Elmer LS 45) with a xenon lamp (λ = 200 nm) was used to analyze the charge recombination rate of the as-prepared film at 25 °C."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Morphology identification,"3.1 Morphology identification As shown in Fig. 1 , the surface of the PVA/Pt/NT/STO film is dense. To enhance the transmittance and charge separation of the film, a porous PVA/Pt/NT/STO film was synthesized in this study. To adjust the pore size of the PVA/Pt/NT/STO film and synthesize the SiO2 with different particle sizes, we controlled the alcohol solvent and synthesis time, respectively. The FESEM images of the as-prepared SiO2 and PVA/Pt/NT/STO films with different pore sizes are presented in Fig. 2 . As shown in Fig. 2(a), (c), and (e), the different particle sizes of the SiO2 prepared using methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol were approximately 335 nm, 650 nm, and 790 nm, respectively. The monodisperse particle sizes of the SiO2 were obtained in ethanol and isopropanol, as shown in Fig. 2(c) and (e). According to the results, the SiO2 particle size increased with decreasing dielectric constants of the solvents [methanol (32.6) > ethanol (24.3) > isopropanol (19.9)] because the static repulsive force was weaker than the van der Waals force [33]. The SiO2 in the PVA/Pt/NT/STO-SiO2 film was etched using the NaOH solution; therefore, the pore size of the film was related to the SiO2 particle size. The FESEM images of PVA/Pt/NT/STO-4S-M-5, PVA/Pt/NT/STO-4S-E-5, and PVA/Pt/NT/STO-4S-I-5 film are shown in Fig. 2(b), (d), and (f), and the average pore sizes were approximately 230 nm, 370 nm, and 450 nm, respectively. The results confirmed that the average pore size of the PVA/Pt/NT/STO film increased with increasing SiO2 particle size. However, the pore size of the PVA/Pt/NT/STO film was s smaller than that of the SiO2 particle size. This was attributed to the 1 h ultrasound sonication prior to the formulation of the casting solution. It was found that the SiO2 particles synthesized in isopropanol were more monodisperse than that in methanol and ethanol. Thus, isopropanol was chosen as the solvent to investigate the effect of synthesis time on the SiO2 particle size. As shown in Fig. 2(e), (g), and (i), the synthesis time and particle sizes of the SiO2 particles were 5 h, 10 h, and 20 h, and approximately 790 nm, 890 nm, and 1,200 nm, respectively. With an increase in the synthesis time, the SiO2 particle size increased because the increase in growth was terminated due to equilibrium solubility. Thus, the particle size increased gradually with synthesis time until the solute concentration of SiO2 reached equilibrium solubility [32]. It can be observed from Fig. 2(f), (h), and (j) that the average pore sizes of PVA/Pt/NT/STO-4S-I-5, PVA/Pt/NT/STO-4S-I-10, and PVA/Pt/NT/STO-4S-I-20 were approximately 450 nm, 500 nm, and 700 nm, respectively. The results confirmed that the average pore size of the PVA/Pt/NT/STO film increased with increasing SiO2 particle size. In addition, the pore number of the photocatalyst film was also determined by controlling the SiO2 concentration. As shown in Fig. 2(j), (k), and (l), the number of pores of the PVA/Pt/NT/STO film increased when the SiO2 concentration increased from 4 wt% to 12 wt%. It was found that the wrinkle of the PVA/Pt/NT/STO film increased when its pore number increased, as shown in Fig. 2(k) and (l). The HRTEM images of the as-prepared SiO2 were shown in Fig. 3 . The particle size of the as-prepared SiO2 increased with decreasing values of the dielectric constants of solvents, as shown in Fig. 3(a–c). As shown in Fig. 3(c–e), the particle size of SiO2 increased with increasing synthesis time. Moreover, the HRTEM results correspond with the FESEM results."
8,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance,"3.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance The porous PVA/Pt/NT/STO films were applied to a photocatalytic hydrogen production system. As shown in Fig. 4 (a), the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiencies of the porous PVA/Pt/NT/STO films were higher than that of the dense PVA/Pt/NT/STO film (18,185 μmol h−1 g−1). The results showed that the hydrogen production rates of the PVA/Pt/NT/STO-4S-M-5, PVA/Pt/NT/STO-4S-E-5, PVA/Pt/NT/STO-4S-I-5, PVA/Pt/NT/STO-4S-I-10, and PVA/Pt/NT/STO-4S-I-20 films increased with increasing pore size. The optimal hydrogen production rate was 27,867 μmol h−1 g−1 when the alcohol solvent and synthesis time were isopropanol and 20 h, respectively. The hydrogen production rates of the PVA/Pt/NT/STO-4S-I-20, PVA/Pt/NT/STO-8S-I-20, and PVA/Pt/NT/STO-12S-I-20 films with different SiO2 concentrations, were 4 wt%, 8 wt%, and 12 wt%, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency increased when the SiO2-I-20 concentration increased from 4 wt% to 8 wt%. Moreover, the PVA/Pt/NT/STO-8S-I-20 film exhibited an optimal hydrogen production rate (34,895 μmol h−1 g−1) that was approximately three times higher than that of the dense PVA/Pt/NT/STO film. When the pore number of the PVA/Pt/NT/STO film increased, the photocatalyst inside the film improved its reaction with water and light. However, the hydrogen production rate decreased from 34,895 μmol h−1 g−1 to 20,535 μmol h−1 g−1 when the SiO2-I-20 h concentration increased from 8 wt% to 12 wt%. To determine the effect of the pore size and number of the porous PVA/Pt/NT/STO film on the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency, we investigated the relationships of the morphology, light transmittance, charge separation ability, and photocatalytic activity among each other using UV/Vis and PL."
9,Light transmittance analysis,"3.3 Light transmittance analysis The light transmittance of the photocatalyst film is an important factor affecting the photocatalytic activity because the valence band electrons and conduction band holes generates when the photocatalyst is illuminated by light. Thus, the higher the light transmittance of the photocatalyst film, the more electron holes generated. Consequently, this results to better photocatalytic activity [37]. As shown in Fig. 5 (a), the light penetrates the dense PVA/Pt/NT/STO film only when its wavelength is greater than 500 nm (visible light range). Therefore, the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency was limited to the visible light because the electrons of the photocatalyst inside the film cannot be excited using UV light. It was found that compared to the dense PVA/Pt/NT/STO film, the 300–700 nm light can penetrate the porous PVA/Pt/NT/STO films, resulting in the higher photocatalytic hydrogen efficiency. Moreover, the UV–visible light transmittance was seen in the following order: PVA/Pt/NT/STO-4S-I-5 > PVA/Pt/NT/STO-4S-E-5 > PVA/Pt/NT/STO-4S-M-5. The UV–visible light transmittance of the PVA/Pt/NT/STO-4S-I-10 was similar to PVA/Pt/NT/STO-4S-I-20 and large than that of PVA/Pt/NT/STO-4S-I-5. It was found that the pore size of the film increased with increasing light transmittance, and it conformed to the hydrogen production efficiency trend [38]. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the UV–visible light transmittance was seen in the following order: PVA/Pt/NT/STO-8S-I-20 > PVA/Pt/NT/STO-4S-I-20 > PVA/Pt/NT/STO-12S-I-20. The light transmittance increased with increasing pore number when the SiO2-I-20 concentration increased from 4 wt% to 8 wt%. However, the light transmittance decreased when the SiO2-I-20 concentration increased to 12 wt%. After the etching of SiO2, the surface of the PVA/Pt/NT/STO-12S-I-20 film wrinkled, which caused light scattering; therefore leading to low light transmittance [39]. Hence, the PVA/Pt/NT/STO-8S-I-20 film showed an optimal light transmittance and photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency."
10,Charge recombination analysis,"3.4 Charge recombination analysis The recombination of the photo-excited electrons and holes produced photoluminescence (PL); hence, there was a positive correlation between the charge recombination rate and photoluminescence emission intensity. The main emission peaks were observed in 360–460 nm, and the excitation wavelength used was 200 nm. Fig. 6 shows the PL spectra of the as-prepared PVA/Pt/NT/STO films with different pore sizes and numbers. As shown in Fig. 6(a), the PL peak of the dense PVA/Pt/NT/STO film was larger than that of the porous PVA/Pt/NT/STO films, and the PL emission intensity was observed in the following order: PVA/Pt/NT/STO-4S-M-5 > PVA/Pt/NT/STO-4S-E-5 > PVA/Pt/NT/STO-4S-I-5 > PVA/Pt/NT/STO-4S-I-10 > PVA/Pt/NT/STO-4S-I-20. This means that the PL emission intensity decreased with the increasing pore size of the PVA/Pt/NT/STO film. Fig. 6(b) shows the PL emission intensity decreasing with increasing SiO2 concentration from 4 wt% to 8 wt%. However, when the SiO2 concentration increased from 8 wt% to 12 wt%, the PL emission intensity increased. Because the surface of the PVA/Pt/NT/STO-12S-I-20 film wrinkled after etching SiO2, the electronic delivery of the wrinkled film was slower than that of the smooth surface of the film. Therefore, when the charge separation rate increased, the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate also increased, which was confirmed in Section 3.2."
11,Conclusion,"In summary, the PVA/Pt/NT/STO films with adjustable pore size and number were successfully synthesized and applied to the photocatalytic hydrogen production in this study. The pore size and number of the porous PVA/Pt/NT/STO film were adjusted by adding different particle size and concentration of SiO2. The optimal alcohol solvent and synthesis time of the as-prepared SiO2 particles were isopropanol and 20 h, respectively, and its particle size was approximately 1,200 nm, which was the largest particle size of the SiO2 in this study. Thus, the PVA/Pt/NT/STO-4S-I-20 film exhibited the optimal hydrogen production rate of 27,867 μmol h−1 g−1 due to the large pore size. To increase pore number of the film, the SiO2 concentration increased from 4 wt% to 8 wt%. The optimal photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of PVA/Pt/NT/STO-8S-I-20 film reached 34,895 μmol/h/g, approximately three times greater than that of the dense PVA/Pt/NT/STO film (18,185 μmol h−1 g−1) because of the excellent light transmittance and charge separation."
