0,Introduction,"Numerous studies have been conducted on the mechanical properties of inorganic/polymer composite hydrogels due to both scientific interests and potential applications in various fields. The incorporation of inorganic nanoparticles into polymeric hydrogels under optimum conditions has led to a remarkable improvement of the mechanical performance of polymer hydrogels [1–6]. Generally, to improve the mechanical performance, it is necessary to disperse nanoparticles in the hydrogels and have favorable interactions between the polymer and nanoparticles [2,7]. In addition, the molecular weight of the constituent polymer is a key factor for enhancing the mechanical performance [8,9]. Disk-shaped clay particles, such as laponite (synthetic hectorite) and montmorillonite, which have negatively charged surfaces and positively charged edges, have been used as a reinforcing agent of polymer hydrogels [1,2,10]. They act as a multifunctional crosslinker in the clay/polymer composite hydrogels, i.e., many polymer chains are attached to one clay particle; consequently, a three-dimensional polymer network with mechanical toughness is formed. Therefore, many researchers including our group have used clay particles to fabricate inorganic/polymer composite hydrogels with excellent mechanical performance. However, in most cases, the incorporation of clay nanoparticles into polymer gels often causes a serious reduction of mechanical performance because it induces the aggregation of clay nanoparticles. To circumvent this problem, the production of clay/polymer composite hydrogels via in-situ free-radical polymerizations of monomers in the presence of clay [1] or by mixing of clay platelets and polymers using the dispersing agent of clay nanoparticles [2,10] have been conducted. Though the composite hydrogels prepared by mixing have advantages of the simple preparation process and easy control of adjustable parameters, such as the composition and molecular weight of polymers, the mechanical performance worsens at high clay contents due to the structural inhomogeneity in the gel. Silica (SiO2) nanoparticles have characteristics of high dispersibility in water, high surface-volume ratio, and comparatively low-cost production [4]. However, it is difficult to produce SiO2/polymer composite hydrogels with excellent mechanical performance without any surface modification due to comparatively weak interactions between SiO2 and polymers. Therefore, various surface modifications of SiO2 nanoparticles are required for producing SiO2/polymer composite hydrogels with excellent mechanical performance [11,12]. As mentioned above, clay and SiO2 nanoparticles have different behaviors in dispersibility and binding capacity. Therefore, composite gels using clay or SiO2 as a reinforcing agent are expected to possess different characters. Thus, this study aims to study the effects of SiO2 and clay nanoparticles on the mechanical properties of polymer hydrogels. We used PVA hydrogels containing borax as polymer gels, which are well known as “slime”. Although the PVA/borax hydrogels possess high extensibility, their mechanical strength is very weak [14]. Furthermore, we used clay (laponite) and SiO2 nanoparticles with comparatively small size because the previous study clarified that the mechanical performance of the composite hydrogels worsened, as the dimensions of the clay platelets became larger [13]. In particular, we focus on clarifying the mechanism by which different mechanical performance for clay/PVA/borax and SiO2/PVA/borax hydrogels is obtained. In addition, we report the synergistic effect of clay and SiO2 nanoparticles on the mechanical properties of PVA/borax hydrogels."
1,Experimental section,
2,Samples,"2.1 Samples SiO2 nanoparticles with a 4.5-nm diameter (Nissan Chemical Corporation), a disk-shaped clay sample (Laponite XLG [Mg5.34Li0.66Si8O20(OH)4]Na0.66, RockWood Ltd., Japan) with a 26-nm diameter and a 1-nm thickness were used in this study. We used PVA with a weight-averaged molecular weight of 9.4 × 104 and hydrolysis higher than 99% from Sigma-Aldrich and sodium tetraborate decahydrate (borax) from Kanto Chemical Co. Inc., which is hereinafter designated as PVA94K. We used PVA with M w = 4.4 × 104 from Sigma-Aldrich for quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurements (this PVA is hereinafter denoted as PVA44K) to facilitate the flow of PVA aqueous solutions. Tetrasodium pyrophosphate (TSPP) was used to prevent the aggregation of clay platelets."
3,Preparation of composite hydrogels,"2.2 Preparation of composite hydrogels For preparing x wt% (x = 5–15) SiO2/PVA94K hydrogels, PVA94K powder and sodium tetraborate decahydrate were added to SiO2 dispersion with a certain concentration and later heated to 90 °C. Then, the mixture was thoroughly stirred to dissolve them. The prepared hydrogel was placed in a stainless mold with a thickness of 1 mm and was pressed for 4 min at ca. 70 °C. The molded sample was placed in an incubator at 5 °C overnight before various measurements. For preparing y wt% (y = 2.5–15) clay/PVA94K hydrogels, Laponite XLG was added gradually in a TSPP aqueous solution and mixed with a magnetic stirrer for 20 min. Later, PVA94K powder and borax were added to the clay/TSPP dispersion and then heated to 90 °C to dissolve them. Thus, the hydrogel prepared was molded similarly to that of the SiO2/PVA94K hydrogel. For preparing 10 wt% SiO2/5 wt% clay/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax hydrogels, first, a SiO2/TSPP aqueous dispersion was prepared by mixing the constituents. Later, Laponite XLG was added gradually in the SiO2/TSPP dispersion and mixed with a magnetic stirrer for 20 min. In addition, after PVA94K was added to the SiO2/clay/TSPP dispersion and the mixture was stirred for 20 min, borax was added. The mixture was heated to 90 °C to dissolve them. The hydrogel was molded similarly to that of the SiO2/PVA94K or clay/PVA94K hydrogel. The final composition of PVA94K was 20 wt%, and those of SiO2, clay, and borax are shown in the text."
4,Tensile measurements,"2.3 Tensile measurements Tensile tests of the composite hydrogels prepared in the above method with 10-mm length and 15-mm width were conducted with TENSILE TESTER STM-20 (ORIENTEC) at a stretching speed of 10 mm/min. The tensile stress was calculated with a cross-sectional area of an undeformed sample, whereas the strain ε was calculated using the following equation, ε = ΔL/L 0, where ΔL and L 0 are the deformation and the initial length of the test specimen, respectively. The Young’s modulus, E, of the test specimen was obtained from a slope of the stress–strain curve in a small strain range. The average values of E, tensile strength σ T, and fracture strain ε f were estimated from at least four tensile tests."
5,Simultaneous synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering/wide-angle X-ray scattering measurement,"2.4 Simultaneous synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering/wide-angle X-ray scattering measurement We performed simultaneous SAXS/WAXS experiments at the beamline 6 A of the Photon Factory at the High Energy Acceleration Research Organization in Tsukuba, Japan. An X-ray with a wavelength of 1.5 Å was used for the SAXS/WAXS measurements. The scattered X-rays were detected by a two-dimensional detector, PILATUS-1 M (for SAXS)/100 K (for WAXS). The two-dimensional images were circularly averaged to obtain scattering profiles as a function of the magnitude of the wave vector q using a software (SAngler) [15], which is defined by 4π sin(θ/2)/λ, where θ and λ denote the scattering angle and wavelength of the X-ray, respectively. The scattering intensity obtained by the circular average of the SAXS images was corrected for the intensity of the incident beam, background scattering intensity, and transmittance, and then reduced to absolute units [16]. The data correction and the fitting analysis were performed using Igor Pro 8 software."
6,Fourier Transform Infrared (FT–IR) spectroscopy,2.5 Fourier Transform Infrared (FT–IR) spectroscopy FT–IR (JASCO FT/IR 4700) was performed to characterize the hydrogels. The samples for FT-IR measurements were freeze-dried and measured via the attenuated total reflection method.
7,Quartz crystal microbalance,"2.6 Quartz crystal microbalance We performed QCM measurements using a QCM apparatus (QCM922A, Seiko EG&G) with 9 MHz AT-cut QCM with a gold electrode at a flow speed of 30 μl/min at 22 °C in an incubator (CN-40A, Mitsubishi Electric). The resonance frequency, f, was recorded as a function of time with the QCM apparatus. When a substance was adsorbed on the electrode, the resonance frequency decreased with the additional mass according to the Sauerbrey equation [17]. (1) Δ f = − 2 f 0 2 A μ q ρ q Δ m , where Δf and Δm are the resonance frequency shift and the additional mass, respectively; f 0 is the resonance frequency of the unloaded quartz crystal; A, μ q, and ρ q are the surface area of the quartz crystal, shear modulus, and density, respectively. The exchange of the injected sample was performed after the frequency reached a constant value."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Mechanical properties of SiO2/PVA/borax and clay/PVA/borax hydrogels,"3.1 Mechanical properties of SiO2/PVA/borax and clay/PVA/borax hydrogels Fig. 1 depicts representative tensile stress σ versus strain (ε = ΔL/L 0) curves for SiO2/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax hydrogels at different SiO2 concentrations (Fig. 1a) and clay/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax hydrogels at different clay concentrations (Fig. 1b). The tensile stress for SiO2/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax hydrogels became higher with increasing SiO2 concentrations, whereas mechanical properties of clay/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax hydrogels became poorer at higher clay concentrations. Fig. 2 presents the tensile modulus E (a), tensile strength σ T (b), and fracture strain ε f (c) at various SiO2 or clay concentrations. The elastic modulus increased with an increase in clay or SiO2 contents. This behavior was usually observed because an increase in the concentration of nanoparticles decreased the interparticle distance and consequently increased the crosslinking density. At low concentrations, the tensile strength for clay/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax hydrogels was higher than those of SiO2/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax hydrogels, but both the composite gels exhibited high extensibility; especially 5 wt% SiO2/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax hydrogel was not fractured even at the limit value of our apparatus. At high concentrations, the extensibility and the tensile strength for clay/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax hydrogels significantly decreased, whereas E and σ T for SiO2/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax hydrogels markedly increased with an increase in SiO2 concentrations under relatively high elongation. The former behavior might be due to the aggregation of clay nanoparticles. The decrease in the tensile strength by the addition of clay nanoparticles was also reported for PVA composite hydrogels prepared using the freezing–thawing method by Morariu et al. [18]. Next, we examined the effect of borax concentrations on the mechanical properties of 10 wt% SiO2/PVA94K/borax and 5 wt% clay/PVA94K/borax hydrogels. First, we checked the gelation ability for SiO2/PVA94K or clay/PVA94K aqueous mixtures without borax by vial inversion test (Fig. S1). As a result, SiO2/PVA aqueous mixture without borax did not gelate, whereas clay/PVA aqueous mixture without borax gelated. Fig. 3 shows typical stress–strain curves for 10 wt% SiO2/PVA94K/borax hydrogels (Fig. 3a) and 5 wt% clay/PVA94K/borax hydrogels (Fig. 3b) at different borax concentrations. There was a remarkable increase in the tensile stress of 10 wt% SiO2/PVA94K/borax hydrogels with an increase in borax concentration, whereas the tensile stress for clay/PVA hydrogels did not increase with increasing borax concentrations. Fig. 4 depicts plots of the tensile modulus E (a), tensile strength σ T (b), and fracture strain ε f (c) against borax concentrations. The effects of the addition of borax on the mechanical properties of 10 wt% SiO2/PVA94K and 5 wt% clay/PVA94K hydrogels were different. For 10 wt% SiO2/PVA94K/borax hydrogels, E and σ T significantly increased, as the borax concentration increased. In contrast, the tensile strength for 5 wt% clay/PVA94K/borax hydrogels did not increase with an increase in borax concentration, although the modulus slightly increased. We performed a vial inversion test to check the gelling ability of SiO2/borax in water or clay/borax in water (Fig. S2); the image shows that SiO2/borax gelated in water, whereas clay/borax did not gelate in water. Thus, SiO2 particles formed a complex with borax. Moreover, the behavior of ε f for both 10 wt% SiO2/PVA94K/borax and 5 wt% clay/PVA94K/borax hydrogels was similar, i.e., ε f attained a maximum value at a low borax concentration. This result might be explainable by the two effects of borax on the mechanical properties of the composite hydrogels; the addition of borax leads to the increase in the length of the network PVA chains and the increase in the number density of crosslinking. At low borax concentrations, the former was dominant; the longer network chains due to the addition of a small amount of borax induced high elongation of the composite gels. At higher borax concentrations, the crosslinking density increased, so the fracture strain decreased due to the lowering of the length of the network chains, although the tensile strength increased."
10,Quartz crystal microbalance and FT–IR measurements,"3.2 Quartz crystal microbalance and FT–IR measurements QCM measurements were performed to estimate interactions between PVA and SiO2 or interactions between PVA and clay nanoparticles ( Fig. 5). The injection of each sample was conducted in the following order: (a) for the QCM measurements to estimate interactions between PVA and SiO2, distilled water ⇒1 wt% PVA44K aqueous solution⇒rinse⇒1 wt% SiO2 aqueous solution ⇒rinse; (b) for the QCM measurements to estimate interactions between PVA and clay, distilled water ⇒1 wt% PVA44K aqueous solution⇒rinse⇒1 wt% clay/0.05 wt% TSPP aqueous solution ⇒rinse. When PVA44K solution was injected, the resonance frequency largely decreased (Fig. 5a). The decrease in the resonance frequency continued even after rinsing distilled water, indicating PVA chains were tightly adsorbed on the gold surface of the quartz electrode. Subsequently, when the SiO2 solution was injected, the resonance frequency did not change, suggesting that PVA chains were unadsorbed on SiO2 nanoparticles, which agreed with the result of the vial inversion test shown in Fig. S1. In Fig. 5b, after injection of PVA44K solution, clay solution was injected. As a result, the resonance frequency markedly decreased, which indicated PVA chains were adsorbed on clay nanoparticles. This result also agreed with the behavior in Fig. S1. Thus, it was confirmed that PVA chains were adsorbed on clay nanoparticles, whereas they were not directly attached to SiO2 nanoparticles. In addition, we performed FT–IR measurements to examine the interactions between clay and PVA. Fig. 6 depicts the FT–IR spectra for clay, PVA, and clay/PVA mixture. The band at 657 cm−1 for clay was assigned to the Mg3OH bending vibrations [19,20], and it shifted toward the lower frequency for clay/PVA. Moreover, a characteristic peak for pure PVA at 1084 cm−1 was assigned to the stretching vibration of C−O [21,22]. The band was shifted to lower values for clay/PVA. These results suggest the presence of hydrogen bond between PVA and clay, which agree with the result of QCM."
11,Wide-angle X-ray scattering,"3.3 Wide-angle X-ray scattering WAXS experiments were performed to investigate the structure of SiO2/PVA94K/borax and clay/PVA94K/borax hydrogels. Fig. 7 depicts WAXS curves for SiO2/PVA94K /0.16 wt% borax hydrogels at different SiO2 concentrations (Fig. 7a) and for clay/PVA94K /0.16 wt% borax hydrogels at different clay concentrations (Fig. 7b). The WAXS curves had a scattering peak at q ≈ 1.38 Å−1, which was ascribed to the overlapping of (101) and ( 10 1 ̅ ) reflections of PVA crystals [23,24]. The scattering peak for SiO2/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax hydrogels was quite small, and the peak intensity was independent of SiO2 concentrations. Meanwhile, the peaks for clay/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax hydrogels were larger than those of SiO2/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax hydrogels. The higher the clay concentration, the larger the peak intensity, suggesting that clay nanoparticles induced crystallization of PVA. Clay nanoparticles have a plate-like shape; therefore, the PVA chains adsorbed on clay nanoparticles were likely to align. Thus, clay/PVA94K/borax hydrogels have a high modulus at high clay concentrations despite the remarkable reduction of mechanical performance (Fig. 2)."
12,Synergistic effects of addition of both SiO2 and clay on the mechanical properties of poly(vinyl alcohol)/borax hydrogels,"3.4 Synergistic effects of addition of both SiO2 and clay on the mechanical properties of poly(vinyl alcohol)/borax hydrogels As mentioned above, clay/PVA94K/borax hydrogels possessed relatively high tensile strength at low clay concentrations, but the mechanical performance worsened at high clay concentrations because of the inhomogeneous structure in the composite hydrogels. Meanwhile, the tensile strength of SiO2/PVA94K/borax hydrogels increased with the increase in SiO2 concentration under relatively high elongation, although the enhancement of the mechanical strength was relatively small at low SiO2 concentrations. Thus, the mechanical properties of clay/PVA94K/borax and SiO2/PVA94K/borax hydrogels were different. Expecting further enhancement of the mechanical performance, we added both SiO2 and clay nanoparticles to PVA hydrogels. As a result, 10 wt% SiO2/5 wt% clay/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax hydrogels were mechanically tough and robust ( Fig. 8). Besides, 10 wt% SiO2/5 wt% clay/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax hydrogel was highly stretchable (>1000%) ( Fig. 9). The tensile result of 10 wt% SiO2/5 wt% clay/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax hydrogel was compared with that of 10 wt% SiO2/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax hydrogel or that of 5 wt% clay/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax hydrogel ( Fig. 10). The modulus of 10 wt% SiO2/5 wt% clay/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax hydrogel was much higher than the sum of the moduli of 10 wt% SiO2/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax gel and 5 wt% clay/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax gel. In addition, the fracture strain was much higher. Thus, the addition of both clay and SiO2 nanoparticles was effective for preparing composite hydrogels with excellent mechanical performance. Let us consider synergistic effects of the addition of both SiO2 and clay nanoparticles on the mechanical properties of PVA/borax hydrogels. It is important to notice that the tensile stress–strain curve for 10 wt% SiO2/5 wt% clay/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax hydrogel exhibited a clear yielding behavior. The shape of the curve was similar to that of the double network (DN) gel well-known as tough hydrogels [25]. In the case of DN hydrogels, the double networks composed of the rigid network (1st network) and the soft network (2nd network) generated mechanical toughness [26]. Up to the region where the yielding behavior was observed, the 1st network dominated the mechanical strength of the hydrogel, whereas the 2nd network made a significant contribution to high extension. In the case of SiO2/clay/PVA94K/borax hydrogel, clay/PVA network may correspond to the rigid network because clay nanoparticles act as a multifunctional crosslinker that can adsorb many PVA chains. On the other hand, ductile SiO2/PVA/borax network formed by complexations between hydroxyl groups of PVA (SiO2) and borate yielded high extension. Thus, the combination of both networks may be the origin of mechanical toughness for SiO2/clay/PVA94K/borax hydrogel."
13,Structures of SiO2/clay/poly(vinyl alcohol)/borax hydrogels,"3.5 Structures of SiO2/clay/poly(vinyl alcohol)/borax hydrogels We examined the structures of SiO2/PVA94K/borax, clay/PVA94K/borax, and SiO2/clay/PVA94K/borax hydrogels using the synchrotron SAXS technique. Fig. 11 depicts SAXS profiles for 10 wt% SiO2/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax gel, 5 wt% clay/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax and 10 wt% SiO2/5 wt% clay/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax hydrogels. The scattering curve for 10 wt% SiO2/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax composite gel had a small peak at q ≈ 0.067 Å−1 due to the interparticle interference effects. The SAXS curve for 10 wt% SiO2/5 wt% clay/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax composite gel also had a small peak at almost the same position. The upturn of the scattering intensity for both gels was observed at smaller q, suggesting inhomogeneities in the gels. Since heavier atoms had a larger scattering length in X-ray [27], the X-ray scattering intensity from the nanoparticles might be dominant. The scattering intensity from spheres of radius R can be expressed as follows [28]: (2) I(q) = I 0 P(q) S(q) with (3) P q = 3 sin qR − qR cos qR qR 3 2 . where P(q) and S(q) correspond to the scattering intensity from the intraparticle interference (form factor) and the inter-particle interference (structure factor), respectively; I 0 is a prefactor of the scattering intensity. The Gaussian distribution of the radius of spheres with the average radius R ave and the standard deviation σ was considered. To calculate the structure factor S(q), we adopted the Percus-Yevick (PY) hard-sphere model [29–31]. In the model, S(q) is described as follows: (4) S q = 1 + 24 ϕ G A / A − 1 with (5) A = 2 q R HS and (6) G A = α A 2 sin A − A cos A + β A 3 2 A sin A + 2 − A 2 cos A − 2 + γ A 5 − A 4 cos A + 4 3 A 2 − 6 cos A + A 3 − 6 A sin A + 6 , where R HS is an interaction radius, which defines minimum distance of closest approach between nanospheres and ϕ is the volume fraction of spheres. For the excess scattering at small q, it was necessary to add another function, since the PY functions could not express the upturn of the intensity due to the inhomogeneous structure. Therefore, we added the Debye-Bueche function [32], (7) I DB q = I 1 1 + ξ 2 q 2 2 , where I 1 is the prefactor and ξ denotes the characteristic length representing the inhomogeneities. First, we analyzed the SAXS data for 10 wt% SiO2/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax composite gel using Eqs. (2)–(7). The results obtained in the analysis are summarized in Table 1. The obtained values were close to those estimated from SAXS analysis of 10 wt% SiO2/3.5 wt% PAAS gel, which had been reported elsewhere [33], except for the value of ξ, suggesting that the assumption that the scattering intensity of 10 wt% SiO2/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax hydrogel mainly came from that of SiO2 nanoparticles was approximately good. The value of the particle size (R ave = 31.8 Å) obtained in the analysis was only slightly larger than the average size of isolated SiO2 nanoparticles obtained in the previous study (R ave =22.3 Å) [33], suggesting that many SiO2 nanoparticles did not aggregate in the composite gels. Next, we analyzed the SAXS data for 10 wt% SiO2/5 wt% clay/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax hydrogel. The form factor from thin disk particles P TD(q) is described as follows [34]: (8) P TD q = 2 sin 2 ( qH ) qH 2 1 q 2 R 2 1 − J 1 ( 2 qR ) qR , where 2H and R are the height and radius of disk particles, respectively and J 1 is the first-order Bessel function. Neglecting the interparticle interference, the scattering intensity is (9) I TD q = I 2 P TD q , where I 2 is the prefactor of the scattering intensity. We analyzed the SAXS data for the 10 wt% SiO2/5 wt% clay/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax hydrogel using Eqs. (2)–(9), where we used the values of 2H = 10 Å and R = 130 Å estimated in a previous study [10]. The analyzed results are also shown in Table 1. The PY parameters were close to those of 10 wt% SiO2/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax hydrogel. The value of R ave for 10 wt% SiO2/5 wt% clay/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax hydrogel was almost the same as that of 10 wt% SiO2/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax hydrogel, suggesting that many SiO2 nanoparticles also did not aggregate in the 10 wt% SiO2/5 wt% clay/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax hydrogel. The value of R HS slightly decreased by the addition of clay nanoparticles. This result might reflect that SiO2 nanoparticles excluded by the addition of clay nanoparticles were allowed to be closer to each other. The value of ξ representing the characteristic length of inhomogeneities in the gel decreased. Thus, SAXS analysis revealed that the inhomogeneities were suppressed by the addition of both clay and SiO2 nanoparticles."
14,Structural model of SiO2/poly(vinyl alcohol)/borax and clay/poly(vinyl alcohol)/borax hydrogels,"3.6 Structural model of SiO2/poly(vinyl alcohol)/borax and clay/poly(vinyl alcohol)/borax hydrogels As illustrated above, PVA chains adsorbed on clay particles, whereas they did not adsorb on SiO2 particles but were attached to them via borax. At low concentrations of nanoparticles, the tensile strength of clay/PVA94K/borax hydrogels was larger than that of SiO2/PVA94K/borax hydrogels. This behavior might be ascribed to the difference in functionalities of both nanoparticles, which represent the number of crosslinking points per particle. The functionality of clay/polymer composite hydrogels was quite large [10,35], which caused high modulus and tensile strength. In addition, the larger crystallinity of PVA for clay/PVA94K/borax hydrogels revealed by WAXS measurements was one of the causes of the larger mechanical strength than SiO2/PVA94K/borax hydrogels. Considering the above results, schematic representations for both composite hydrogels are depicted in Fig. 12. Although SAXS analysis showed that SiO2 aggregates were not formed much in the composite gels, SiO2/PVA94K/borax hydrogel displayed a spatial inhomogeneity, which might reflect an inhomogeneous distribution of SiO2 nanoparticles. These composite hydrogels were formed via various types of crosslinking, such as the physical crosslinking between clay nanoparticles and PVA, micro-crystals of PVA and tetrahedral complexation between hydroxyl groups of PVA (or SiO2) and borate. The multiple crosslinking might be effective for producing tough composite hydrogels. Next, let us consider the effect of borax concentration on the mechanical properties of the composite hydrogels. Notably, both clay/PVA94K/borax and SiO2/PVA94K/borax hydrogels exhibited very high extensibility at low borax concentrations. The addition of a small amount of borax increased the length of network polymer chains, which might play the same role as the use of ultrahigh molecular weight polymers. As reported in previous papers [9,36], clay/ultrahigh molecular weight polyacrylamide (PAM) and clay/ultrahigh molecular weight polyethyleneoxide (PEO) composite hydrogels also had high extensibility (>1500%). At high borax concentrations, the length of the network chains between crosslinking points was short due to the increase in the crosslinking density. Therefore, the extensibility was lowered with the increase in borax content, although the mechanical strength increased. The latter effect was remarkable for SiO2/PVA94K/borax hydrogels because the crosslink between PVA chains and SiO2 nanoparticles was formed via borax. SiO2/clay/PVA94K/borax hydrogel consisted of the rigid clay/PVA network, ductile SiO2/PVA/borax network and micro-crystals of PVA (Fig. 12(c)). The addition of both clay and SiO2 nanoparticles to PVA94K/borax hydrogels enhanced extension and tensile strength, which might be ascribed to the reduction of the inhomogeneities, as revealed by synchrotron SAXS in addition to the double network effect discussed in Section 3.4. Crystallites of PVA were also formed for 10 wt% SiO2/5 wt% clay/PVA94K/0.16 wt% borax hydrogel (Fig. S3). In addition, the decrease in the interparticle distance accompanying the increase in the nanoparticles content and densification of PVA chains arising from the excluded volume effect might significantly enhance the crosslinking density, so that robust hydrogels could be produced."
15,Conclusions,"The effect of the addition of two kinds of fillers (clay and SiO2) nanoparticles on the mechanical properties of PVA94K/borax hydrogels was investigated in this study. The combined use of borax and SiO2 or borax and clay at low borax concentrations produced highly stretchable composite hydrogels. The PVA hydrogels produced at low borax concentrations increased the apparent molecular weight of PVA, which enabled high elongation. Therefore, combined use of conventional crosslinker and inorganic particles that act as multifunctional crosslinkers was effective for preparing composite hydrogels with excellent mechanical performance; the method was efficient, especially for polymers difficult to synthesize ultrahigh-molecular weight polymers such as PVA. At low filler concentrations, the mechanical performance of clay/PVA94K/borax hydrogels was better than that of SiO2/PVA94K/borax hydrogels. At high filler concentrations, the mechanical performance of clay/PVA94K/borax hydrogels became drastically poor because of the aggregation of clay nanoparticles in the gel, whereas the mechanical strength of SiO2/PVA94K/borax hydrogels was enhanced with the increase in SiO2 concentration under moderate elongation. These different behaviors for both composite hydrogels came from the difference in interactions between PVA and clay, as well as between PVA and SiO2. Namely, PVA chains directly adsorbed on clay nanoparticles, whereas they did not adsorb on SiO2 nanoparticles but crosslinked with them via borax. Besides, this study clarified that the addition of both SiO2 and clay nanoparticles to PVA/borax hydrogels enabled the production of robust and highly stretchable composite hydrogels. These composite hydrogels might be promising as soft functional materials such as biomedical tissue engineering and soft actuators due to the toughness and robustness."
