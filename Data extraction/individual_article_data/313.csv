0,Introduction,"Ever-increasing efforts have been made to develop clean and renewable energy resources to tackle with the severe energy and environmental crises. Hydrogen (H2), a most promising renewable and green energy source featuring high energy density, has aroused extensive attention [1,2]. However, the dominating approach for the hydrogen production is still the traditional steam methane reforming up to date, which results in huge energy consumption and serious greenhouse gas emissions [3,4]. Photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production has been regarded as one of potential approach to convert solar energy into chemical energy since the first report of photoelectrochemical water splitting on a TiO2 electrode by Fujishima and Honda in 1972 [5–7]. Nevertheless, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the other half-reaction of water splitting, have become one of the biggest obstacles in the commercial applications of overall photocatalytic water splitting. Meanwhile, O2 is of low value and will be inevitably mixed with the produced H2 during the photocatalytic water splitting, implying a potential explosion risk and difficult separation issues [8,9]. To overcome these, sacrificial reagents such as lactic acid, ascorbic acid, triethanolamine, methanol, glycerol, ethanol and Na2SO3/Na2S have been used to suppress OER by consuming photogenerated holes and accelerate the H2 evolution, during which these agents are oxidized [10–16]. Regrettably, such a strategy suffers from much increased total cost of hydrogen production and fails to make full use of the oxidizing capacity of photogenerated holes. By virtue of the above considerations, it is of great significance to find novel strategies to promote hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Photosynthesis, a traditional but highly attractive strategy that uses fully renewable solar energy as an energy source, features a number of distinguished advantages such as the direct photo-energy conversion to chemical energy, much shortened reaction path and being free from harsh reaction conditions and organic reagents, providing a green and clean way for the syntheses of pharmaceuticals, fine-chemicals and value-added products under mild reaction conditions [17,18]. Selective oxidation, the second largest industrial process after polymerization which shares 30% of total production in the chemical industry [19], has attracted extensive attention in the field of photosynthesis recently [20]. Among numerous selective oxidation reactions, the conversion of aromatic alcohols to corresponding aldehydes has been recognized as one of the most important functional group conversion processes [21]. In addition, aldehydes are a kind of highly valuable intermediates for the organic syntheses of a wide spectrum of chemicals such as confectionary fragrance, dyes, perfumes and pharmaceuticals [22,23]. The traditional syntheses of aldehydes demands stoichiometric oxidants, such as chromate or permanganate, which are highly toxic and strongly corrosive, thus causing serious environmental problems [24,25] and greatly preventing their large-scale applications. While still unsatisfactorily, most of the photocatalytic synthesis of aldehydes based on the photocatalytic materials, though much greener than the traditional ones, are operated in organic solvents or in the presence of oxygen as a mild oxidant, which, therefore, still suffer from environmental-unfriendliness and poor efficiency due to the waste of photogenerated electrons. Accordingly, an oxidant (or, oxygen)-free photosynthetic approach for the selective aromatic aldehyde synthesis by aromatic alcohol oxidation in aqueous media will be the most desired environmentally friendly process, and therefore of great significance. In this strategy, highly efficient aromatic alcohol oxidation to valuable chemicals, instead of the simple sacrificial agent consumption, dominates the whole process in coupling with the hydrogen production without oxygen evolution, which, however, remains a great challenge. A high performance photocatalyst for the photocatalytic oxidation of aromatic alcohols while promoting hydrogen production is the premise for the above strategy. Herein, an efficient non-noble metal bifunctional photocatalyst, NiS nanoparticle-modified CdS nanorod composites (NiS/CdS), has been synthesized by a facile two-step hydrothermal route, which is especially active for catalyzing the photosynthesis of benzaldehyde (BAD) in coupling with the promoted photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in aqueous solution under oxygen-free conditions, thanks to the synergetic interaction between NiS and CdS. Especially, the optimal 30% NiS/CdS photocatalyst achieves a remarkable H2 production rate of 207.8 μmol h−1 and BAD generation rate of 163.8 μmol h−1 under visible light (λ ≥ 400 nm), which are about 139 and 950 times those of CdS, respectively. Besides, a BAD selectivity of 91.6% has been obtained at a benzyl alcohol (BA) conversion rate of 80%. To our knowledge, this catalyst exhibits the highest hydrogen and aldehyde evolution rates in the field of photocatalytic synthesis of aldehyde while promoting hydrogen production in green aqueous solution. Moreover, a CH(OH)Ph free radical pathway has been proposed for the synthesis of BAD according to the radical quenching experiments and the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopic studies. This work makes the best utilization of photogenerated holes and electrons to produce value-added fine chemicals and hydrogen, is therefore of great significance in the development of green renewable energy technology and photocatalytic synthesis."

3,Synthesis,"2.2 Synthesis 2.2.1 Preparation of CdS CdS nanorods (NRs) were synthesized by a solvothermal method. Typically, CdCl2·2.5H2O (2.31 g) and CH4N2S (2.31 g) were dissolved in C2H4(NH2)2 (30 mL). After stirring for 1 h, the mixture was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 160 °C for 24 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed with distilled water and ethanol three times.

4,Photocatalytic synthesis of BAD while promoting H2 evolution,"2.3 Photocatalytic synthesis of BAD while promoting H2 evolution The photocatalytic reactions were performed in a sealed vitreous reactor (capacity: 500 mL) with a quartz window and a constant temperature circulating water system, in which the temperature of reaction systems was kept at 25 °C with circulating water. Typically, 20 mg of catalyst was dispersed in 100 mL of 10 mM BA aqueous solution, via 5 min ultrasonication. Before irradiation, the reactor was purged with high purity nitrogen and stirred for 30 min in the dark to dissipate the inside air and attain an adsorption–desorption equilibrium. Then the suspension was illuminated by a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with an UV cutoff filter (λ ≥ 400 nm) for 4 h. The generated H2 was quantified using an online gas chromatograph (GC). The liquid products can be analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer and GC. The details of characterization, cycling experiments, photoelectrochemical measurements, product quantification and isotope labeled study of H2 are presented in the Supporting Information."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The crystalline structure of the obtained photocatalysts was determined by XRD technique. As shown in Fig. 1 (a), all diffraction peaks of CdS are well indexed to hexagonal phase CdS (JCPDS No. 41-1049). The XRD patterns of 5% NiS/CdS and 10% NiS/CdS nanocomposites exhibit similar diffraction patterns with pristine CdS and no diffraction peaks corresponding to NiS can be detected, which is attributed to the low amounts and/or high dispersion of NiS relative to the CdS nanorod substrate [26,27]. In comparison with that of pure CdS, four diffraction peaks can be clearly seen at 30.2°, 34.7°, 46°, 53.5° from the XRD patterns of 30% NiS/CdS, which are well-indexed to (100), (101), (102), (110) crystallographic planes of hexagonal phase NiS (JCPDS No. 02-1280), suggesting the successful loading of NiS on CdS in this composite. At the molar ratios of Ni/Cd up to 50% and 70%, additional characteristic peaks corresponding to rhombohedral phase NiS (JCPDS No. 12-0041) can be identified at 32.2°, 35.7°, 40.5°, 48.8°, 50.1°, implying a mixture of differently structured NiS. Moreover, with the increase of Ni/Cd molar ratio, the characteristic peaks of NiS are gradually intensified. The morphologies of single-phase CdS and 30% NiS/CdS nanocomposite have been studied by SEM observations. Pristine CdS demonstrates a regular but surface-smooth nanorod-like morphology in Fig. 1(b) of ca. 20–40 nm in diameter, while small NiS nanoparticles of ca. 10–25 nm in diameter are well-dispersed on the CdS nanorods as seen in Fig. 1(c) of 30% NiS/CdS nanocomposite, which is obviously different with blank NiS (Fig. S1). To obtain more detailed structure information of 30% NiS/CdS, transmission electron microscopic imaging (TEM) has been conducted (Fig. 1d), from which irregular NiS nanoparticles of about 20 nm in size anchored on the surface of CdS nanorods of approximately 25 nm in average diameter can be observed. The visible lattice d-spaces of 0.336 and 0.316 nm corresponding to the (002) and (101) crystallographic planes of hexagonal CdS, as well as 0.200 nm for (102) lattice plane of hexagonal NiS, can be observed in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1e), which is in agreement with the corresponding XRD results. Compared with the TEM and HRTEM images of CdS (Fig. S2), the microstructure and d spacing values of 30% NiS/CdS remain unchanged, implying that NiS nanoparticles are mainly loaded on the surface of CdS instead of being doped in CdS lattice. Scanning transmission electron microscopic high-angle annular dark field (STEM-HAADF) image as well as the corresponding elemental mapping (Fig. 1f) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) survey spectrum (Fig. S3) all reveal the presences of Cd, S and Ni elements in 30% NiS/CdS. More importantly, as confirmed by the elemental mapping, Cd and Ni are uniformly distributed in the nanorods and the nanoparticles, respectively, while S is distributed throughout the entire catalyst region, further revealing that NiS is mainly anchored on the surface of CdS. To further investigate the surface chemical composition and valence states of obtained photocatalysts, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was adopted. The XPS survey spectrum of 30% NiS/CdS is mostly similar with that of CdS, from which Cd, S, C and O peaks can be observed, while an additional peak located at around 860 eV corresponding to Ni can only be found for 30% NiS/CdS (Fig. 2 a, Fig. S4). Elements C and O observed in the spectra come from the graphite conductive adhesive and the absorbed gaseous molecules [28]. The peaks located at 405.0 and 411.7 eV in the high-resolution Cd 3d XPS spectrum of CdS (Fig. 2b, bottom) are attributed to the Cd 3d 5/2 and Cd 3d 3/2 states of Cd2+ [29,30], while those at 406.5 and 413.1 eV correspond to the Cd2+ species bonded to oxygen atoms [31,32]. The S 2p peaks located at 161.6 eV (S 2p 3/2) and 162.8 eV (S 2p 1/2) are ascribed to S2– [33] (Fig. 2c, bottom), while those at 163.7 and 168.9 eV can be ascribed to S2 2− arising from the S-S bonding and the small amount of S in a higher valence state, respectively [33,34]. While in 30% NiS/CdS, the characteristic peaks with the binding energies of Ni 2p 1/2 at 874.3 eV and Ni 2p 3/2 at around 856.8 eV are assigned to Ni2+ (Fig. 2d), and the additional doublets at 862.9 and 881.0 eV can be considered to be its satellite peaks [35]. More importantly, compared with pristine CdS, the peaks of Cd 3d (Fig. 2b top) and S 2p (Fig. 2c top) in the 30% NiS/CdS nanocomposite have obviously shifted to higher binding energies, which implies a strong electronic interaction between NiS and CdS and possible electron transfer from CdS to NiS [36,37]. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopies were employed to probe the electronic and local geometry structure of the composites. XANES spectra in Fig. 2(e) show the highly similar characteristics of NiS/CdS and NiS with each other. It is obvious that the energy E NiS/CdS is lower than E NiS at the Ni K edge (e.g, Normalized = 0.7 μ(X)) from the numerical fitting results of the measured curves. The peak position for Ni K-edge of NiS/CdS composite shifts to a lower energy level compared with that of NiS, which indicates a non-negligible interaction between NiS and CdS, featuring significant electron donation to Ni atoms from Cd atoms [38]. The corresponding Fourier transform curves in the R-space of Ni K edge EXAFS spectra of NiS/CdS, NiS and Ni foil are shown in Fig. 2(f). NiS/CdS and NiS show only a single but identical strong peak at about 1.8 Å assigned to the Ni-S [39], which is considerably shorter than that of Ni–Ni bond (2.18 Å) in Ni foil. Interestingly, compared with Ni foil and NiS, the peak intensity of NiS/CdS is much lower, indicating the increased lattice disorder, which can be rationalized by nano-size effect and defective nature of NiS/CdS nanocomposites [38,40,41]."
7,Evaluation of photocatalytic activity,"3.2 Evaluation of photocatalytic activity To assess the photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared photocatalysts, photosynthesis of BAD in coupling with photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction was carried out in 10 mM BA aqueous solution under oxygen-free conditions using a Xe lamp with an UV cutoff filter (λ ≥ 400 nm) as light source for 4 h. Photocatalytic experiment was first carried out in water with or without adding BA. As confirmed by the gas chromatographic results (Fig. S5), no other gas can be detected except for H2 during the reaction. The obtained NiS/CdS samples all show significant hydrogen productions in the BA solution (Table S3, Entry 3–7), however, almost no H2 can be detected in water without adding BA (Table S3, Entry 11), indicating that the introduction of BA can effectively promote the photocatalytic H2 evolution. Comparatively, as shown in Fig. 3 (a), no H2 can be detected under the catalysis of single NiS owing to its over-narrow band gap (E g), and the pristine CdS exhibits extremely low photocatalytic activity with a total H2 production of 6 μmol in 4 h, which can be ascribed to its rapid recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and severe photocorrosion. Upon adding 5 mol% NiS, the resultant NiS/CdS composite exhibits remarkable photocatalytic activities for HER. Obviously, 30% NiS/CdS (the actual molar ratio of Ni/Cd from XPS is about 31.5%, which is in line with the result of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometric (ICP-OES) measurements, as detailed in Table S2) presents the highest hydrogen production rate of 207.8 μmol h−1 (831 μmol in 4 h). In the above photocatalytic reaction, BA addition can not only promote the photocatalytic hydrogen production, but also can be oxidized itself into high value-added BAD. Liquid products were analyzed by 1H, 13C NMR spectroscopy. The 1H NMR spectra of the solvent reveal the presences of BAD besides H2O, the internal standard and BA, while no other BA oxidation products can be detected (Fig. 3d). The above results indicate that BAD is the main oxidation product of BA photocatalyzed by NiS/CdS. The characteristic peak intensity decrease of BA and the corresponding increase of BAD amount over time can be clearly seen in Fig. 3(d) and Table S3 (Entries 5 and 8), indicating the successful photosynthesis of BAD by oxidizing BA. Similar results can also be obtained from the 13C NMR stack plot (Fig. S6). As illustrated in Fig. 3(b) and Table S3 (Entries 1 and 2), CdS and NiS show negligible productions of BAD (about 0.689 and 0 μmol, respectively). Upon NiS decoration on CdS, the yield of BAD, BA conversion rate and BAD selectivity are remarkably augmented (Table S3, Entries 1–7), suggesting a strong synergetic effect between CdS and NiS in enhancing the photoredox performance. Among the NiS/CdS photocatalysts, the 30% NiS/CdS nanocomposite not only shows the optimal photocatalytic activity for H2 production, but simutaneouly presents the highest activity for BAD generation at a rate of 163.8 μmol h−1 (655 μmol in 4 h), which is approximately 950 times that of blank CdS. Meanwhile, the conversion of BA was elevated from 2.5% to 80% and the selectivity of BAD boosted from 32.8% to 91.6% (Table S3, Entries 1 and 5) on 30% NiS/CdS. The above results evidently suggest that NiS/CdS is an efficient dual-functional photocatalyst for the concurrent BAD synthesis by BA oxidation and BA oxidation-promoted H2 evolution. Notably, both the H2 production and BAD generation rates by NiS/CdS nanocomposites increase first and then decrease with the increase of the molar ratio of Ni/Cd. At the molar ratio of Ni/Cd being as high as 50% and 70%, the surface of CdS would be covered by excessive amounts of large NiS nanoparticles, and moreover, the nanorod-like structure of CdS became collapses (Fig. S7c and d), accompanied by the decrease in photocatalytic performance. The above results are due to the shading effect of excessive NiS, which reduces the activity of CdS under light stimulation. While at molar ratio of Ni/Cd being lower 30% (Fig. S7a and b), there would be not enough NiS species to transfer the electrons from CdS, resulting in the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The H2 production and BAD generation over the physical mixture of CdS and NiS (30% NiS-CdS) reached 473 and 352 μmol, respectively, which are much lower than that of 30% NiS/CdS synthesized by hydrothermal method (Fig. S8, Table S3, Entries 5 and 15). The significantly enhanced photocatalytic performances of 30% NiS/CdS can be attributed to promoted charge transfers between CdS and NiS resulting from intimate contact and efficient interactions between these two phases. Moreover, the effect of light intensity on the photosynthesis of BAD in coupling with H2 evolution performance has also been investigated as shown in Fig. S9. Also attractively, 30% NiS/CdS as a bifunctional catalyst is catalytically active to oxidize other para-substituted BA molecules of different substituent groups such as –OCH3 and –Cl, into corresponding aromatic aldehydes in coupling with the promoted photocatalytic H2 evolution (Figs. S10–S12). Significantly, the stability and recyclability are essential criterions to evaluate the photocatalyst. As shown in Fig. 3(c), the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of 30% NiS/CdS shows no noticeable decline after being cycled for four times in the presence of BA, revealing the high photostability and reusability of 30% NiS/CdS. However, the H2 evolution activity of individual CdS displays a significant decline after reaction for 16 h due to the known photocorrosion of metal sulfides (Fig. S13), indicating the strong photocorrosion suppression role of NiS on CdS. After photocatalytic reaction for 4 h, no noticeable change can be observed from the XRD patterns and SEM images of 30% NiS/CdS (Fig. S14b and d) and CdS (Fig. S14a and c). Subsequently, the high-resolution Cd 3d XPS spectra of CdS (Fig. S15a) and 30% NiS/CdS (Fig. S15b) after the photocatalytic measurement have been compared, from which a lower ratio of CdO to CdS can be found for the latter (Fig. S15c), implying that the addition of NiS is beneficial in inhibiting the degradation of CdS to CdO. The Cd2+ leaching in the reaction solutions were also tested by ICP-OES to evaluate the photocorrosion degrees of CdS and 30% NiS/CdS. After the reaction for 4 h, 0.57 ppm and 0.0133 ppm Cd2+ have been detected in the solutions under the catalysis by CdS and 30% NiS/CdS, respectively (Fig. S15d), indicating that NiS modification can efficiently suppress the photocorrosion of CdS. All the above experimental results show that the addition of NiS is capable of elevating the stability of CdS and suppressing the photocorrosion of CdS, which are in agreement with the photocatalytic activity and stability testing outcomes. Notably, photosynthesis of BAD by BA oxidation in aqueous solution usually suffers from low alcohol conversion rate and aldehyde selectivity. Therefore, in the conventional photo-synthesis, organic solvents such as acetonitrile (CH3CN) were used inevitably as reaction media to inhibit the generation of hydroxyl radicals (·OH), which is non-selective and strongly oxidizing, and to elevate the BAD selectivity. However, the high cost and pollution of acetonitrile to the environment are non-neglectable. Therefore, the present photosynthesis of BAD with high selectivity and conversion rate in aqueous solution is greatly appealing. To verify the excellent performance of the photocatalyst in water, CH3CN was also used for comparison. According to the gas chromatographic results (Fig. S16), both the conversion of BA and productions of H2 and BAD are markedly lower in CH3CN than in water (Fig. 3e and Table S3, Entry 12), indicating that the reaction pathways by 30% NiS/CdS could be totally different from those of the reported photocatalysts in organic solutions. The above results also suggest that water may have acted as a major source of protons for H2 generation and only a small part of the H2 is derived from the dehydrogenation of BA, as verified by an isotope labelling experiment via a mass spectrometry as demonstrated later in this study. By comparing the literature reports on photocatalytic synthesis of high value-added fine chemicals (aldehydes) accompanying promoted H2 evolution in green aqueous solution, the 30% NiS/CdS in this work shows the highest photocatalytic H2 production and chemical synthesis rates (Fig. 3f and g, detailed comparisons are listed in Table S5)."
8,Mechanism investigation,"3.3 Mechanism investigation Since the photocatalytic activity is closely related to the photoresponse performance of the photocatalyst, UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) have been firstly used to evaluate the optical absorption performance of obtained photocatalysts, and the results are shown in Fig. 4 (a). The pristine CdS shows a visible light absorption edge at approximately 554 nm. With the increase of Ni/Cd molar ratio, the light absorption in the visible light and near infrared region intensifies, which can be ascribed to the strong absorption in the range of 300–800 nm of NiS [42]. Therefore, the obtained NiS/CdS nanocomposites are capable of harvesting visible light, and therefore can serve as active photocatalysts under visible light. To validate the thermodynamic feasibility of BAD photosynthesis by BA oxidation while promoting H2 evolution theoretically, the energy level structure of the photocatalyst has been established. The E g and conduction band (CB) values of CdS are 2.38 eV and −0.25 V vs. RHE, respectively, as calculated from Kubelka-Munk function [33] (Fig. S17) and Mott-Schottky measurements (Fig. S18), therefore, the valence band (VB) of CdS can be calculated to be about 2.13 V vs. RHE. Moreover, the oxidation potentials (at a current density of 1 mA cm−2) are about 2.05 and 2.41 V vs. RHE for BA oxidation to BAD and BAD oxidation to benzoic acid (BAC), respectively, as obtained by the CV results (Fig. 4b). Obviously, the CB of CdS is more positive than the oxidative potential of BA/BAD, but more negative than the oxidative potential of BAD/BAC, therefore, BA can be photo-oxidized into BAD with high selectivity but the resultant BAD will not be further oxidized to other substances. At the other half reaction, the CdS possesses a more negative CB than the reductive potential of H2 evolution (0 V vs. RHE), is therefore able to catalyze HER. Based on the aforementioned results, it is convincing that the BAD photosynthesis by BA photo-oxidization and the correspondingly promoted photocatalytic H2 evolution are thermodynamically feasible. To clarify the electron-hole pair separation efficiency, the photoelectrochemical (PEC) and photoluminescence (PL) measurements of as-synthesized samples have been performed. As sketched in Fig. 4(c), blank NiS is almost unresponsive to visible light, which can be ascribed to its inherent narrow band gap of E g = 0.4 eV. Excitingly, the photocurrent densities of all obtained NiS/CdS samples boosted sharply, which are much higher than that of single CdS, implying that the introduction of NiS can effectively promote the separation and transfer of the photogenerated charge carriers. The 30% NiS/CdS nanocomposite shows the highest photocurrent density, which is consistent with the photocatalytic activity results. To further validate the abovementioned results, charge carrier transfer resistance between the catalysts and electrolyte has been tested via EIS. As shown in Fig. 4(d), NiS/CdS nanocomposites possess a much smaller charge transfer resistance than individual CdS, and the 30% NiS/CdS shows the highest efficiency in the separation and transfer of photoinduced charge carriers. Fig. 4(e) presents the LSV curves of NiS/CdS samples and CdS in 0.2 M Na2SO4 without light irradiation, from which it can be found that the loading of NiS onto CdS has significantly enhanced the current density in the potential range of 0 to −0.9 V vs. RHE and lowered the overpotential for H2 evolution. Among these catalysts, 30% NiS/CdS shows the highest current density, demonstrating the most favorable HER reaction kinetics. Steady state PL spectrum has been utilized to investigate the recombination rate of the photoexcited electron-hole pairs of the as-obtained photocatalysts. CdS shows an intense luminescence band at around 500–550 nm under the excitation wavelength of 344 nm (Fig. 4f), and comparatively, all prepared NiS/CdS nanocomposites show remarkably decreased PL emission intensity, demonstrating their much suppressed photogenerated carrier recombination. The 30% NiS/CdS shows the lowest PL emission intensity, which means the largely promoted transfer of photoinduced charge carriers. All above experimental results confirm that 30% NiS/CdS has the strongest photoexcited carrier separation and highest transfer efficiency, which eventually result in a prominent performance enhancement in the photocatalytic redox reaction compared to its counterparts. Moreover, isotope labelling method has been used to further clarify the source of evolved H2, which was carried out in 10 mM BA aqueous solution (solution A, H2O) or 10 mM BA deuterium oxide solution (solution B, D2O), and the produced H2 or D2 was identified by mass spectrometer. As mirrored in Fig. 5 (a), no doubt only H2 can be produced from solution A. Gaseous product obtained from solution B is predominantly D2, indicating that the hydrogen is mainly evolved from water reduction (Fig. 5b). Notably, the small amount of produced HD can be attributed to the dehydrogenation of BA in the solution. HDO molecule can be formed by the recombination between released H+ and OD−, which can be further reduced to HD by photogenerated electrons. To unveil the reaction mechanism, a series of control experiments have been carried out, as listed in Table S3 (Entries 9 and 10). No BAD and H2 can be detected when the reactions were conducted in the absence of light or photocatalyst, implying the indispensable roles of both light illumination and the photocatalyst. Then the radical quenching experiments have been conducted and the results are shown in Fig. 5(c and d). When CCl4 and ammonium oxalate were added to the system as electron and hole scavengers, respectively, the yields of H2 and BAD, BA conversion rate and the BAD selectivity all decreased dramatically, indicating that photogenerated holes and electrons play important roles respectively in the BA oxidation and the promoted H2 evolution. However, when isopropanol was added as hydroxyl radical scavenger, all of the photocatalytic performances remained almost unchanged, implying the negligible role of hydroxyl radicals in the photocatalytic process. Furthermore, it is noted that the yields of BAD and H2 reduce from 655 and 831 to 0 and 4 μmol, respectively, under the presences of radical scavenger DMPO, suggesting the completely suppressed photoredox reactions (Table S4, Entry 5), and confirming that the radical intermediate productions are the necessary transient step for the photosynthesis of BAD and the promoted H2 evolution. To further clarify the radical intermediate mechanism, ESR spectroscopic technique using DMPO as the spin-trapping agent was employed to monitor the reaction. As revealed in Fig. 5(e), there is no free radical signal on 30% NiS/CdS and CdS samples when the reaction was performed in the dark. However, the six characteristic signal peaks for DMPO–CH(OH)Ph can be clearly observed over 30% NiS/CdS under visible light illumination (λ ≥ 400 nm), indicating the generation of CH(OH)Ph free radicals. Such carbon-centered radicals were triggered by visible light driven photocatalysis and acted as the indispensable intermediates during photocatalytic synthesis of BAD. In addition, no carbon-centered radicals could be detected when catalyzed by CdS under light irradiation, indicating incapability of CdS in producing DMPO-Cα radicals, which is in line with the photoactivity test mentioned above. According to the above discussion, a possible mechanism towards such a dual-functional synergetic photoredox reaction is proposed in Figs. 5(f) and 6. When the energy of incident light is higher than the E g level of the photocatalyst, CdS in the NiS/CdS composite will be stimulated by the light to produce photoexcited electrons and holes, and subsequently the electrons migrate from the CB of CdS to that of NiS, leaving the holes in the VB of CdS, which prevents the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. The adsorbed aromatic alcohol initially undergoes Hα deprotonation into more active alkoxide anion and H+ ion [43]. Subsequently, the alkoxide anion is oxidized by photogenerated holes in the VB of CdS, forming carbon-centered radical and another H+, and then the carbon-centered radical is further oxidized by holes to form the corresponding aromatic aldehyde product (reaction 1 in Fig. 6 ). Simultaneously, the photogenerated electrons on NiS can reduce water into H2 and OH− (reaction 2 in Fig. 6), while the above released H+ ions from aromatic alcohol deprotonation recombine with OH− to form H2O molecule (reaction 3 in Fig. 6), which accelerates the reaction 2 in the figure for promoting HER from water molecules. As far as we discussed above, NiS activated by the photogenerated electrons from CdS serves as active sites for hydrogen evolution and meanwhile CdS offers active sites for BA oxidation. It is such a synergetic effect between CdS and NiS that results in the excellent photocatalytic performances of photosynthesis of BAD and the promoted hydrogen evolution [44]."
9,Conclusion,"In summary, a nanocomposite photocatalyst of NiS nanoparticle-modified CdS nanorod (NiS/CdS) has been successfully synthesized by a two-step hydrothermal method, which serves as efficient bifunctional catalyst for the concurrent photocatalytic synthesis of BAD by BA oxidation and the BA oxidation-promoted H2 production under an oxygen-free condition. NiS/CdS nanocomposites with optimized composition exhibit outstanding photocatalytic performances in the H2 evolution, BA conversion and selective BAD production, which is among the best catalytic performances under similar conditions. The high performance of NiS/CdS has been attributed to the synergetic catalytic effect between CdS and NiS, in which NiS anchored on CdS favors the transfer and separation of photogenerated carriers, and the resultant hole-abundant CdS and electron-enriched NiS are responsive respectively for the BA oxidation and hydrogen evolution. The reaction mechanism has been proposed to be a CH(OH)Ph free radical pathway. This work provides a novel dual-functional and noble-metal-free catalyst of high performance and durability for producing clean and renewable energy and value-added fine chemicals by making better and simultaneous uses of photogenerated electrons and holes."
