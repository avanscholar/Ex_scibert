0,Introduction,"Iron has been one of the highly abundant metals. It can be a troublesome substance in drinking water supplies, which may contain unsafe levels of iron as a pollutant. It plays an essential role in both biological systems as it has been the highly abundant transition metal in human body [1–3]. Several proteins utilize iron as a catalyst in the oxidoreductase reactions, and as oxygen and electron transporter. The distribution of iron in human body is seriously regulated, which could be attributed to its high potential for biological toxicity [4,5]. The deficiency of iron results in restrictions of oxygen delivery to various cells of different organs leading to weakness and poor immunity. On the other hand, excessive amounts of iron in a living cell are capable to catalyze the production of reactive oxygen species by Fenton reaction [6–8]. This reactive oxygen species are able to damage proteins, nucleic acids and lipids. The toxic effects of iron in living cells have been associated with severe syndromes, such as Huntington’s, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s [9]. Numerous analytical techniques for the detection of toxic iron ions in drinking water have been utilized, including voltammetry, atomic absorption spectrometry, inductive coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, and inductive coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry [10–13]. However, those conventional techniques necessitate sophisticated equipments, trained personnel, time consumption, sample destruction procedure, high cost, and/or tedious sample preparation process, which limit their applications. Thus, simple sensing tools that allow naked-eye colorimetric detection of iron (III) are beneficial over other sensors that necessitate sophisticated instruments and/or procedures. Due to their simplicity, low time consumption, low cost, fast responsiveness and high sensitivity, colorimetric tools have been successfully used for the detection of various hazardous chemicals such as ammonia, phenols, organophosphorus pesticides and hydrogen sulfide [14–21]. Thus, researchers have been recently focused on the development of sensitive and selective colorimetric detection devices for ferric ions [22–25]. However, the development of realistic colorimetric detection tools for ferric ions remains a challenge owing to the lack of appropriate indicator dyes, such low sensitivity, poor selectivity, non-biodegradability and difficult preparation procedures [26,27]. Solid state detection devices have been preferred due to several advantages, such as portability, real time detection, low cost and operational simplicity. Therefore, it has been a challenge to fabricate solid state colorimetric sensors for direct identification of a trace target analytes in real time. The solid-state sensors have been practically favored compared to colorimetric probes dissolved in solution. Thus, they have been ultimately applied for household and basic laboratory assays purposes as portable devices [28,29]. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) exhibits various characteristics, such as excellent film formation ability, emulsification and adhesion properties. PVA has been resistant to solvents, oil and grease and solvents. It exhibits excellent flexibility and tensile strength, as well as high barrier performance to oxygen and aroma. PVA has been utilized in many medical applications due to its low toxicity low, biocompatibility and tendency for protein adhesion. It has been also used in different applications, such as cartilage replacements, pharmaceutical industry, contact lenses, and eye drops [30–34]. Anthocyanins are a class of natural phenolic indicator dyes that can be extracted from different sources, such as red-cabbage, blueberry, black soybean, raspberry and purple cauliflower. They are soluble in water demonstrating different colors, including red, pink, purple, green-yellow and colorless, depending on the pH value [35–37]. Anthocyanins molecular structures belong to flavonoids bearing a flavylium ring. They have been applied as pH indicator dyes due to their color shifts upon changing the pH value. The solutions of anthocyanins displayed red or pink colors at a pH value less than 7, purple color at pH ≈ 7, green-yellow color at a pH value higher than 7, and colorless in the highly alkaline solutions due to complete reduction of anthocyanins [37,38]. Anthocyanins are definitely nontoxic because they have been a constitution of different plants and have been applied as a colorant for foodstuff. Additionally, anthocyanins have been known to display biological activity, such as antioxidant and anticancer, which could be attributed mainly to their quenching ability for the reactive oxygen species [39,40]. Electrospinning has been a simplistic and cost effective technique for the generation of continuous nanofibers from inorganic, polymer and inorganic/organic hybrid substrates [41–45]. Those electrospun nanofibers are characterized by a large surface area, high porosity and a miniature diameter. Additionally, the nanofiber diameter can be easily adapting by adjusted the appropriate parameters of the electrospinning system [46–48]. Electrospun nanofibrous mats have been utilized in a variety of applications in various fields, such as tissue engineering scaffolds [49], environmental remediation [50], sensors and biosensors [51], filtration systems [52], protective clothing [53] and solar cells [54]. Electrospun nanofibers demonstrated great advantages in terms of simple handling and recovery of the electrospun materials [55]. Herein, we report for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, the preparation of electrospun anthocyanin-containing nanofibrous mats from polyvinyl alcohol as a supramolecular hosting matrix and anthocyanin phenolic dye as a spectroscopic probe as real-time colorimetric nanosensor for the determination of ferric ions. The miniaturized interspaced three-dimensional anthocyanin-containing nanofibrous film with high porosity, good interconnectivity and large surface area should be amenable for sensing applications with highly efficiency. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were utilized to investigate the characteristics of the resulting solid state electrospun nanofibrous sensing device. Owing to the high porosity, good interconnectivity and large surface area, the developed sensor exhibited good sensitivity. Both selectivity and detection limit were described. The current study documented a simple production of electrospun nanofibrous sensor with the ability to build up other natural anthocyanin-based nanofibrous materials for a variety of applications, such as sensors, catalysis and biomedical purposes."
1,Experimental details,
2,Materials and reagents,"2.1 Materials and reagents Polyvinyl alcohol (M w 89,000–98,000 g mol−1, 99+%) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. An aqueous solution was prepared by dissolving a suitable amount of polyvinyl alcohol (15% W-V) in distilled water. The working solution of each heavy metal salt was prepared by dilution of the corresponding stock solution in distilled water. Absolute ethanol, sodium hydroxide, glutaraldehyde (25% in H2O), hydrochloric acid (37%) and other reagents (analytical grade) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Salts of heavy metal, including CuCl2, MgCl2, HgCl2, CoSO4, BaCl2, ZnCl2, NiCl2, CrCl3, AlCl3, CaCl2, K2SO4, NaCl, CdCl2, MnCl2 and FeCl3; were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Stock aqueous solutions of those heavy metal salts were prepared by dissolving a suitable amount of each salt in distilled water. The working solution of each heavy metal salt was prepared by dilution of the corresponding stock solution in distilled water."
3,Extraction of anthocyanin,"2.2 Extraction of anthocyanin The anthocyanin extraction was carried out from red-cabbage according to previously reported literature procedure [56,57]. Fresh red-cabbage plant was collected from the local market in Egypt. Generally, red-cabbage is characterized by its low cost, availability and high growth yield. A red-cabbage sample (600 g) was crushed and macerated in a mixture of distilled water/methanol (300 mL; 1:3). An aqueous solution of HCl (1.0 mol L−1) was then added to the extraction system to adjust the pH value at 2. The solution was placed in a fridge at 4 °C for 24 h. The resultant solution was filtered under vacuum; the filtrate was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min, and decanted. An aqueous solution of NaOH (1.0 mol L−1) was slowly added to the generated extract to be neutralized to a pH value of 7. The extract was then placed in a fridge at 4 °C for further analysis."
4,Preparation of polyvinyl alcohol/anthocyanin solutions,"2.3 Preparation of polyvinyl alcohol/anthocyanin solutions Polyvinyl alcohol (15% W-V in distilled water) was mixed with the anthocyanin extract at different ratios, including 100/0, 95/5, 90/10, 85/15, 80/20 and 75/25 V/V of polyvinyl alcohol to anthocyanin extract; which were represented by PVA-AC-0, PVA-AC-1, PVA-AC-2, PVA-AC-3, PVA-AC-4 and PVA-AC-5, respectively. The prepared solutions were sonicated for 60 min prior to electrospinning. Electrospun nanofibers were collected from syringe using a solution of 20 cm3. After electrospinning, the generated electrospun PVA-AC nanofibers were cross-linked under glutaraldehyde vapor in a ventilated fume cupboard to render them water stable. The water-insoluble cross-linked nanofibers were then trapped between two glass slides. The resultant nanofibers was dried at 40 °C in a vacuum oven till a stable mass was accomplished, and was then maintained in a dry-box for further analysis. Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram representing the preparation for the cross-linked polyvinyl alcohol/anthocyanin nanofibers."
5,Electrospinning apparatus,"2.4 Electrospinning apparatus An electrospinning tool composed of three major components, including solution release system, power supply and collecting device (grounded metal drum with a 30 cm length and 10 cm diameter). The generated nanofibers were collected at a 180 rpm rotating speed. Programmable plastic syringe pump with a stainless-steel needle tip linked to a DC voltage supply was utilized to release the PVA-CA solutions at a controlled flow rate (0.8 mL/h). An electric potential were applied to the PVA-CA solutions exceeding its surface tension forces under a high electric voltage (30 kV) power source. Thus, thin nanofiber was extruded from the syringe needle (1.27 mm; 18 gauge) into the collecting system to result in ultra-thin fibrous film deposited on an aluminum foil. This aluminum foil (10 × 10 cm) was located on a wooden panel (15 × 15 cm) built on a copper cylinder and a grounded cable. The syringe pump stainless steel needle tip was vertically adjusted to the center of the aluminum foil. The air-gap distance among the stainless-steel needle tip and collecting system was adjusted to 20 cm. The electrospinning process was performed in a wooden ventilated fume cupboard under ambient conditions."
6,Colorimetric determination of ferric ions,"2.5 Colorimetric determination of ferric ions The presence of iron (III) was monitored by the generated nanofibrous film under ambient conditions. Ferric chloride was dissolved in distilled water at different concentrations ranging between 1 and 350 mg/L at a neutral pH value (~ 7.0). The nanofibrous sensor film was immersed for 3–5 s in each one of the prepared aqueous solutions to result in different coloration measurements. In addition, aqueous solutions of different heavy metal salts in distilled water, including CuCl2, MgCl2, HgCl2, CoSO4, BaCl2, ZnCl2, NiCl2, CrCl3, AlCl3, CaCl2, K2SO4, NaCl, CdCl2 and MnCl2, were prepared and similarly tested under the same concentration (350 mg/L)."
7,Characterization methods,"2.6 Characterization methods 2.6.1 Characterization of anthocyanin High Performance Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-MS) was applied to characterize the anthocyanin extract employing Agilent HP1100 (Waldbronn, Germany). Shinoda’s approach was also applied to test the flavonoid character by adding a piece of magnesium ribbon and hydrochloric acid (1 mL) to the methanolic anthocyanin extract (2–3 mL) to generate a red color after a few minutes [58]. 2.6.2 Surface morphology and structural characterization Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the blank and anthocyanin-containing nanofibrous polyvinyl alcohol films were studied using Quanta FEG-250 microscope at a voltage of 10 kV and a 21 mm distance. The fiber diameter was determined on SEM images using Image J software. The elemental contents of the generated fibers before and after detection of ferric ions were determined by energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer (TEAM-EDS) attached to scanning electron microscope. 2.6.3 Coloration measurements The colorimetric characteristics of the blank and anthocyanin-containing nanofibrous polyvinyl alcohol films were explored on Texflash ACS Datacolor 600 spectrophotometer. The colorimetric changes were monitored under the CIE Lab color parameters, color strength (K/S) and absorbance spectra, which were reported under the same experimental setup using Hunter Lab UltraScanPro spectrophotometer (United States) with a 10° standard observer and D65 illuminant; where, L* is lightness black (0)/white (100), a* is red(+)/green(-), and b* is yellow(+)/blue(-)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Preparation of metallochromic nanofibers,"3.1 Preparation of metallochromic nanofibers Extraction of anthocyanin from red-cabbage was performed in the presence of hydrochloric acid/methanol. The ultraviolet-visible absorption spectrum of the produced extract displayed three absorption peaks at 281, 331 and 536 nm corresponding to flavonoid and phenolic contents of anthocyanin. Shinoda’s test was also employed to examine the presence of flavonoid by adding a piece of magnesium ribbon and a few drops of HCl to the anthocyanin extract in methanol to produce a red color in a few minutes. The anthocyanin extract was characterized by High Performance Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-MS) demonstrating the presence of different phenolic bioactive compounds at different concentrations as shown in Table 1 and Fig. S1. An aqueous solution of polyvinyl alcohol in distilled water was mixed with the anthocyanin extract at different ratios as explained in the experimental section. After sonication, the solutions were subjected to electrospinning to generate electrospun PVA-AC nanofibrous mats, which were cross-linked using glutaraldehyde vapor to make them stable in water. The samples were air-dried to introduce a colorless (control sample) electrospun PVA-AC nanofibrous test strip."
10,Morphological properties of metallochromic nanofibers,"3.2 Morphological properties of metallochromic nanofibers Electrospun polyvinyl alcohol immobilized with anthocyanin extract from red-cabbage demonstrated larger interspaced three-dimensional nanofibrous network with high porosity, good interconnectivity and large surface area. This resulted in their potential application in highly sensitive miniaturized detection systems. The morphology of the prepared metallochromic PVA-AC-4 sensor strip was investigated as low and high magnifications as illustrated in Fig. 2(a, b). The immobilization of anthocyanin extract within the electrospun PVA sensor displayed a nanofibrous miniaturized morphology as demonstrated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. The assembled thin solid state nano-scale fibrous film exhibited a random fiber orientation with high sensitivity to ferric ions owing to the large surface area, good interconnectivity and high porosity, which facilitate the diffusion of iron(III) as the analyte to be detected through the mesh of the nanofibrous mat to the anthocyanin active detection sites. The electrospinning procedure was employed to generate the PVA-AC nanofibrous film was prepared by running a sequence of systematic experiments on the PVA and AC concentration, flow rate, needle tip to receiver distance and applied voltage. Those effects optimized the best spinnability and morphological properties of the PVA-AC fibers. Electrospinning has been an effective, relatively simple, and cost-effective technique to generate composite fibers with diameters range from a few nanometers to several micrometers. It has carried out by the application of a high voltage to a composite solution or extruded melt from a syringe pump to afford porous 3D film. The assembled nanofibers displayed an average diameter of 150–250 nm forming a nonwoven mat. No major changes were monitored in the morphological properties of the produced nanofibers upon increasing the concentration of the anthocyanin extract. The energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS) of the electrospun PVA-AC-4 nanofibers before and after exposure to an aqueous solution of ferric ions is depicted in Fig. 2(c, d). Three elements were detected, including carbon, oxygen and iron. Compared to the total content of the detected ferric analyte, the total contents of carbon and oxygen were monitored as major elemental contents from PVA host polymer and anthocyanin guest extract."
11,Colorimetric performance of metallochromic nanofibers,"3.3 Colorimetric performance of metallochromic nanofibers Different concentrations of ferric chloride in distilled water were prepared in the range from 1 to 350 mg/L. The presence of ferric ions was confirmed by the immersion of the PVA-AC-X (X = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) sensor for a few seconds (3–5 s) under ambient conditions to generate different visible color changes ranging from colorless to pink with the increase of the ferric concentration from 1 to 350 mg/L as shown in Fig. 3. No color change was monitored for the PVA-AC-0 sample as it maintained its beige color in the presence of ferric ions. Additionally, the colorless PVA-AC-X (X = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) sensor strip displayed a pink color upon exposure to ferric aqueous solution at different concentrations. The formation of coordination bond among iron(III) and the phenolic anthocyanin to generate complexes of different levels of the pink color relying on the ferric concentration. A calibration profile curve was assembled for the determination of toxic iron(III) in the concentration region between 1 and 350 mg/L by recording their absorbance intensities at 565 nm. The PVA-AC sensor was successfully employed to determine an unknown concentration of iron (III) in an aqueous medium. As demonstrated in Fig. 4, a correlation profile curve was monitored for the aqueous total content of iron(III). The absorbance intensities at 565 nm exhibited a correlation profile directly proportional to increasing the iron (III) concentration between 1 and 350 mg/L. No changes were detected in absorption intensity of PAV-AC-4 at 565 nm upon decreasing the concentration of the aqueous iron (III) less than 1 mg/L. Thus, the detection limit was monitored as low as 1 mg/L. The visible colorimetric changes were monitored during the increase of the iron (III) concentration owing to complex formation between iron (III) and anthocyanin phenolic hydroxyl substituents. The detection limit was identified from the changes in the absorbance intensity with the increased concentration of iron (III), to reach 350 mg/L, at which no further increments in the absorbance peak intensity at 565 nm was monitored. Thus, the anthocyanin-containing nanofibrous sensor is a simple and efficient; however, it exhibited a detection limit as low as 1 mg/L and as high as 350 mg/L. Both selectivity and interference are two key aspects in evaluating the PVA-AC sensor efficiency. The selectivity of PVA-AC toward iron (III) ions was studied by examining some selected heavy metal salts of mono, di and trivalent ions, including K+, Na+, Mg2+, Cu2+, Hg2+, Co2+, Ba2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Ca2+, Cd2+, Mn2+, Al3+ and Cr3+. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of PVA-AC-4 sensor showed an absorption wavelength at 565 nm in the presence of Fe(III) as shown in Fig. S3. On the other hand, the UV-Vis absorption spectra of PVA-AC-4 sensor displayed an absorption maxima at 379 nm in the absence of metal ions or in the presence of K+, Na+, Mg2+, Hg2+, Co2+, Ba2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Ca2+, Cd2+, Mn2+ or Cr3+ as shown in Fig. S4. The PVA-AC sensor device showed an extraordinary selectivity improvement in the absorption spectra at 565 nm towards iron (III) ions in aqueous medium. On the other side, no remarkable shifts were observed in the absorption spectra of the other competing metal ions verifying the selectivity of the PVA-AC sensor towards iron (III). However, both Al(III) and Cu(II) showed a little sensitivity to the PVA-AC sensor as their absorption spectra were monitored at two different peaks; 388 and 627 nm. This could be ascribed to the different abilities of those metal ions to form a coordination bond with the phenolic hydroxyl substituents on the anthocyanin biomolecule. This phenomenon proved that the PVA-AC sensor can be applied conveniently for the determination of iron (III) in aqueous media by naked-eye testing. A comparative insight on the absorption intensities of PVA-AC-4 at 565 nm for the chosen free metal cations (at constant concentration; 350 mg/L) is displayed in Fig. 5. Those competitive ions demonstrated neglected effects on PVA-AC-4, and consequently the sensor tool can be potentially applied for selective qualitative and quantitative colorimetric detection of toxic iron (III). The current PVA-AC film is a very simple method for real-time and naked-eye detection of the toxic iron(III) without the requirement for any sophisticated instrumental analysis. Both K/S and CIE Lab colorimetric parameters (L*, a*, b*) of different PVA-AC samples were used to evaluate their sensing efficiency ( Table 2). Generally, significant changes were observed in K/S upon increasing the total content of the anthocyanin extract. The nanofibrous films demonstrated significantly different values of the colorimetric parameters (L*, a*, b*) relying on the concentration of the anthocyanin extract. The L* value was found to considerably decrease with increasing the concentration of the anthocyanin extract to designate a darker shade. Upon increasing the concentration of the anthocyanin extract, a* displayed a decreased positive values, while b* showed an increased positive values. Compared to other PVA-AC samples, PVA-AC-4 demonstrated the best film sensor because no changes were monitored in either K/S or CIE Lab colorimetric parameters (L*, a*, b*) upon increasing the concentration of the anthocyanin extract from PVA-AC-4 to PVA-AC-5. Thus, we evaluated PVA-AC-4 sensor to examine the sensor selectivity to iron(III) in aqueous solutions compared to some selected metal ions at a constant concentration (350 mg/L) as shown in Table 3. By studying PVA-AC-4 sensor, only slight changes in K/S and CIE Lab colorimetric parameters (L*, a*, b*) were observed in the presence of metal ions including K+, Na+, Mg2+, Hg2+, Co2+, Ba2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Ca2+, Cd2+, Mn2+ and Cr3+. However, both Al(III) and Cu(II) showed a little sensitivity to PVA-AC sensor similar to Fe(III) [58]. In the presence of ferric ions, the color strength of PVA-AC-4 sensor was increased. Additionally, the a* positive value increased to indicate a color shift from greener to redder shades, while b* changed from positive to negative to designate a color change from yellower to bluer shades [59–62]."
12,Effect of pH on sensor efficiency,"3.4 Effect of pH on sensor efficiency Both anthocyanins and iron(III) ions are relatively sensitive to variations in pH. Thus, a stock aqueous solution of iron(III) (350 mg/L) was prepared. The pH value was increased in the range from 3.75 to 6.00 by the addition of calculated quantities from HCl (1.0 M) and NaOH (1.0 M) aqueous solutions. The UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured for the prepared solutions of the different pH values. The absorbance intensity was reported for each solution. The UV-Vis absorbance intensity was plotted against the pH value as shown in Fig. 6. Negligible changes in the UV-Vis absorbance intensity of the generated AC/Fe(III) complex were monitored at pH less than 3.75 and higher than 6.00, which could be ascribed to the high coagulation rate of iron(III) in the extremely acidic pH range. This coagulation process stops the adsorption and diffusion of iron(III) ions through the PVA-AC film at highly acidic pH less than 3.75. Additionally, the anthocyanin molecules behave as a rigid anion creating electrolyte complexes with cations at pH higher than 6.00. On the other side, an improvement in absorbance intensity was monitored in the pH range between 3.75 and 6.00, which proposed a high range of potential binding among iron(III) ions and anthocyanin active sites. This can be ascribed to the multiple hydroxyl substituents on the anthocyanin molecular structure, which can act as coordinating active. Hence, PVA-AC can be applied as a selective sensor for iron(III) ions in the near neutral pH (3.75–6.00)."
13,Proposed metallochromic mechanism,"3.5 Proposed metallochromic mechanism The colorimetric assessment was utilized for both quantitative and qualitative recognition of iron(III) ions in aqueous media. The phenolic anthocyanin-containing PVA test strip was applied to detect the ions of iron(III) in a given aqueous sample by changing the color of the anthocyanin active sites through the formation of AC-Fe(III) coordination complex. Such chromic coordination generates a robust and stable colored phenolic anthocyanin/ferric complex inside the PVA nanofibrous film within 3–5 s. The color change from colorless to light pink and dark pink depended mainly on the concentration of iron(III). At low total contents of iron(III), fractional coordination of the ferric ions occurred to the phenolic hydroxyl substituents on the anthocyanin dye within the PVA nanofibrous film leading to partial chromogenic reaction. Such partial coordination was found to increase upon increasing the concentration of iron(III). Thus, the PVA-AC-3 sensor generates a range of different colors depending on the concentration of iron(III), which affects on the coordination degree between iron(III) and hydroxyl substituents on the anthocyanin dye. Consequently, this affects on the degree of the chromic interaction as depicted in Fig. 7; where Ar represents the aromatic ring of the anthocyanin bearing free phenolic hydroxyl substituents. There are several indicators that have been previously reported for the determination of ferric ions in aqueous environments, such as dopamine functionalized graphene quantum dots [63], lanthanide metal-organic framework [64], carbon dot-functionalized interferometric optical fiber [65], pyrophosphate functionalized gold nanoparticles [66] and gold and silver nanoparticles [26]. However, those indicators are either expensive, unselective, slow, non-portable, non-biodegradable, unreachable by simple preparation approaches or difficult to operate under mild conditions. Recently, colorimetric detection devices have been proved to be an efficient, simple and low-cost detection tools for ferric ions. Thus, the natural anthocyanin extract can be applied as an effective indicator for ferric ions with high sensitivity, selectivity, biodegradability and simple preparation procedures [26,27]. Only, few research papers were reported describing the application of anthocyanins extracted from red-cabbage as a sensor in the solution state for the detection of ferric ions at a detection limit as low as 11 mg/L [58]. The current study showed a portable solid-state sensor with a detection limit as low as 1 mg/L and as high as 350 mg/L."
14,Conclusions,"We developed a novel, simple, fast, inexpensive, selective, highly sensitive and portable colorimetric anthocyanin-activated nanofibrous polyvinyl alcohol metallochromic sensor for the detection of iron(III) ions. The detection process was mainly based on anthocyanin extract from red-cabbage as a spectroscopic colorimetric agent immobilized onto a polyvinyl alcohol nanofibrous host. We described a sensor device for iron(III) in aqueous environments in the pH region from 3.75 to 6.00, with the ability to generate a naked-eye color change from colorless to light pink and dark pink depending on the concentration of iron(III). The detection process demonstrated an expedient technique for real time determination of iron(III). The nanofibrous PVA-AC sensor displayed high selectivity in comparison to the selected metal cations, including K+, Na+, Mg2+, Cu2+, Hg2+, Co2+, Ba2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Ca2+, Cd2+, Mn2+, Al3+ and Cr3+. The limit of detection was monitored as low as 1 mg/L and as high as 350 mg/L. The detection mechanism depended on the formation of colored AC/Fe(III) coordination complex on the PVA nanofibrous surface. Compared to other previously described detection methods that require electronic parts as well as sophisticated equipment and/or procedures, the PVA-AC colorimetric sensor demonstrated real time detection without the need for sophisticated procedures or trained personnel. Moreover, this facile recognition method can be applied on drinking water to monitor iron(III) that is typically generated from the rusted water transport pipelines."
