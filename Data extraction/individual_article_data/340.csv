0,Introduction,"Ethanol reforming has been indicated as a promising technology due to the possibility of biomass-derived raw materials (Llera et al., 2012; Song et al., 2017). Besides, an economic comparison with hydrogen production via traditional methane steam reforming has recently confirmed the validity of the catalytic oxidative steam reforming (OSR) route (Kaiwen et al., 2018). To reduce the economic impact of the catalyst on the process feasibility as well as avoid detrimental effects on its activity (i.e., reducing the formation of coke), a combination of noble and non-noble transition metals has been largely studied as the active species (i.e. Pt-Ni, Pt-Co, Ru-Ni, Ag-Ni, Rh-Co, Rh-Ni) (Bshish et al., 2011; Greluk et al., 2016; Ruocco et al., 2019; Viviente et al., 2017). Among the supports, rare earth oxides have been widely employed, due to their redox properties and oxygen storage capacity, which enhance the activity for reforming reactions and promote at the same time the oxidation of coke. Regardless of the adopted formulation, heterogeneous reactions are commonly modelled by using apparent reactions with empirical-based coefficients. Alternatively, microkinetic models (i.e., detailed kinetic mechanisms) accounting for heterogeneous and homogeneous elemental reactions are essential to describe the partial oxidation of ethanol (Koehle and Mhadeshwar, 2012). These mechanisms usually consist of hundreds of species and thousands of reactions, roughly related by a factor of 5 (Egolfopoulos et al., 2014). A hierarchical approach is commonly implemented to optimize the size of the mechanism (Ranzi et al., 2012). The thermodynamic and kinetic parameters included in the models can derive from experiments, empirical correlations (e.g. Benson’s group additivity rule), and theoretical-based calculations (e.g. ab initio calculations) (Gao et al., 2016). The short residence time of small radicals narrows the applicability of the experimental approach for extremely reactive substances (Hansen et al., 2006). Furthermore, the number of input parameters encourages the application of simplified methods, such as empirical correlations. However, large uncertainties are commonly associated with this approach (Sumathi and Green, 2003). On the contrary, the ab initio approach represents the most accurate theoretical-based approach (Wang and Sheen, 2015), but the elevated computational cost associated to its implementation promotes the adoption of hybrid strategies combining data from different sources. To optimize the accuracy of the generated mechanisms and computational costs required for their generation, the most influential species and reactions are selected. After that, their properties are calculated through ab initio calculations, if experimental data from literature are missing (Sabbe et al., 2005). Afterwards, a less expensive method can be employed for the estimation of the properties of species and reactions having a smaller influence on the whole mechanism. This approach guarantees a considerable reduction in terms of computational requirements with limited impact on the accuracy of the model. To make this distinction, sensitivity and rate of production analyses are commonly performed (Song et al., 2018). The former technique allows for the evaluation of the effects of each parameter on the representative measurable variables, as described in detail in current literature (Varma et al., 1999; Pio et al., 2019a, 2019b), whereas the latter approach generates a path connecting reactants and products through the most relevant intermediates, together with estimations on the branching ratios (Salzano et al., 2018). As with any numerical estimation validation against experimental data is strongly recommended to guarantee meaningful results. In this perspective, validated theoretical-based mechanisms should be preferred for the characterization of reactive systems. Nevertheless, although the absence of practical constraints limiting the applicability of these mechanisms, these mechanisms have been mainly adopted for the characterization of energy production systems. Furthermore, the integration of catalytic and detailed chemistry can play an essential role in filling the lack of knowledge still limiting the development of optimized reactive systems (Pio and Salzano, 2020). Numerical investigations may indicate the elemental steps transforming reactants into final products, together with the rate-determining steps associate with this process (Lu and Law, 2009). Based on this information, the effects of catalysts on the reactive systems can be inferred and, thus, the properties of the catalyst can be optimized to stand on a fundamental understanding of the involved phenomena. To this aim, several techniques have been developed and commonly employed for the characterization of homogeneous systems (Dryer et al., 2014; Pio et al., 2020). However, a dearth of similar studies involving catalysed systems can be found in the current literature. In this light, this work presents an in-depth analysis integrating experimental and numerical features for the characterization of chemical phenomena involved in the production of hydrogen via OSR over a Pt-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst. A comparison between an empirical-based apparent reaction mechanism (macro kinetic) and theoretical-based elemental reaction mechanism (microkinetic) describing the oxidation of light alcohols will be presented and discussed. Its implementation will allow for the evaluation of the most relevant reaction paths and rates, providing phenomenological explanations for the catalytic effects on the investigated reactive system."
1,Materials and methods,"This work deals with both experimental and numerical approaches, with this section having been divided into two sub-sections, accordingly. The former was devoted to the development of an apparent kinetic model for the catalytic case based on the experimental data collected in this work, whereas the latter was focused on the reduction of a detailed kinetic mechanism available in current literature and suitable for ethanol oxidation finalized to the estimation of the preferred pathways and intermediates."
2,Experimental approach,"2.1 Experimental approach The experiments were performed in the presence of a bimetallic Pt-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst. The sample was prepared via wet impregnation. Details on the preparation can be found elsewhere (Ruocco et al., 2019). The CeO2/SiO2 ratio was kept constant to 30 wt%, whereas Ni, as well as Pt content, were equal to 10 and 3 wt%, respectively. The 3Pt-10Ni/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst displayed a specific surface area of the final catalyst equal to 268 m2·g−1 and a good ceria dispersion, with an average size of CeO2 crystallites of 6 nm (Ruocco et al., 2019). Before OSR measurements, the catalyst can be reduced in situ (through a temperature-programmed reduction procedure under a 5%H2/N2 stream from ambient temperature to 600 °C) to generate the active phases form the metals oxides. The catalyst stability for OSR was investigated for 100 h between 400 °C and 600 °C, under steam to an ethanol molar ratio of 4 and oxygen to ethanol molar ratio of 0.5. The resulting composition of the reacting mixture was C2H5OH10%/ H2O 40%/ O2 5%/ N2 45%, corresponding to an equivalence ratio of 6 based on the combustion stoichiometry. The experimental apparatus for the durability tests was described beforehand (Ruocco et al., 2019). The durability measurements were performed at ambient pressure in a fluidized bed reactor (operating in a continuous mode) loaded with 0.82 g of catalyst; before the test, the catalyst was reduced in situ under a 5 %v/v H2 in N2 stream at 600 °C for 3 h. The ethanol/water stream, mixed with nitrogen, was vaporized in a boiler operating at 120 °C while oxygen was directly fed into the reactor (in correspondence of the catalytic bed); the weight hourly space velocity WHSV, calculated to the ethanol mass flow-rate, was 12.3 h−1. The analysis system was composed of 3 units: a spectrophotometer, a paramagnetic and thermo-conductivity analyser. The stream exiting the reactor was sent to an FT-IR (Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectrum) spectrophotometer (provided by Thermo Fischer Scientific), which allowed to measure the concentrations of all the species except hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen (the instrument is not capable to analyse the noble gases such as xenon and argon, and homo-molecular di-atomics such as O2, N2 and H2). Thus, the stream passed through a cold trap and reached a block of two analysers provided by ABB, made of a paramagnetic and a thermo-conductivity analyzer, for the measurement of oxygen and hydrogen concentration, respectively. The whole analysis block provided the concentrations of H2O, C2H5OH, CO, CO2, CH4, O2, H2, and CH3CHO. During the reforming tests, the carbon balances closure was close to 100% at the beginning of the test and decreased to 90–95% after 100 h of time-on-stream. The kinetic measurements were performed under the above-mentioned reacting mixture composition in the same laboratory plant. A fixed bed reactor (i.d. = 0.015 m) operating at 1 atm in a continuous mode was employed; a very low contact time (corresponding to a WHSV of 61.7 h−1) was selected to allow the system to be far from thermodynamic equilibrium. The temperature was reduced from 600 to 400 °C and the kinetic model was developed, for every temperature, under the hypothesis of isothermal plug flow reactor. The differential mass balance equations (Eq. (1), F is the molar flow-rate, W the catalytic mass, a is an index of the component, j an index of the reaction r and q the total number of the hypothesized reactions) were numerically solved through the Euler method (applied to Eq. (2), solved for every i-th species) and the kinetic constants were optimized through a least square analysis based on the minimization of the sum of the residual squares of the experimental and predicted molar fractions of every species (the Excel tools were used through the “objective function” command). (1) d F a dW = ∑ j = 1 q ν aj · r j (2) F a , i + 1 = F a , i - ∑ j = 1 q ( ν aj · r j ) · Δ W"
3,Numerical approach,"2.2 Numerical approach Preliminary analyses estimating the equilibrium compositions for all the investigated initial conditions, under constant temperature and pressure assumption, were carried out, at first. A dedicated script included in the open-source Cantera suite (Goodwin, 2003), based on the minimization of free Gibbs’s energy, was adopted to this aim. The required properties were calculated using the thermodynamic database included in the detailed kinetic mechanism developed by Sarathy et al. (2012) for butanol oxidation. This mechanism consists of about 150 species and 2530 reactions, with it having already been validated for the description of the chemical behaviour of light alcohols in a wide range of conditions (Sarathy et al., 2012). Then, the effectiveness of the catalysts adopted during the experimental campaign (η) was evaluated by comparing the mole fraction of products of interests obtained experimentally ( x i F , E x p ) and theoretically ( x i F , N u m ) (i.e., assuming the achievement of the equilibrium) (Eq. (3)). (3) η = x i F , E x p - x i F , N u m Based on the reported definition, η > 0 can be obtained for stable reactants and intermediates, whereas η < 0 should be expected for products. Subsequently, the cited detailed kinetic mechanism was implemented to simulate the tubular reactor characterized by a length of 0.025 m and an internal diameter of 0.015 m, following the system described in the section dedicated to the experimental procedure. A plug flow regime and constant temperature were assumed, at this stage. A series of 10,000 stirred reactors was considered to reproduce the plug-flow reactor. Mass balances were solved for all the species included in the kinetic mechanism. Governing equations (i.e., conservation of mass and energy) were solved via the implementation of Newton iteration technique. Relative tolerance of 10−4 and absolute sensitivity of 10−6 were selected based on a grid independence analysis reported elsewhere (Pio et al., 2019a, 2019b; Pio and Salzano, 2019). Under these conditions, sensitivity and rate or production analyses were performed in absence of the catalyst to indicate the most relevant species and reaction paths in the homogeneous phase. The former was conducted considering reactants, acetaldehyde, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen as measurables and defining a threshold value of 0.01 for the imposed disturbance. The rate of production (RoP) was performed considering a termination time of 60 s, assumed sufficient to include most of the homogeneous transformations and considerably higher than the contact time adopted in the experimental campaign. The validity of this assumption was confirmed by the presence of complete routes connecting reactants to products within the resulting reaction pathways. The produced flux diagrams were adopted to identify the most relevant intermediates. The results obtained through the sensitivity analysis were expressed in terms of a normalized sensitivity coefficient (NSC) accounting for the variation of the generic measurable m of the species i ( δ m i ) due to a perturbation in the kinetic coefficient k of the reaction j ( δ k j ), defined as in Eq. (4): (4) NSC = k j m i ∙ δ m i δ k j Then, reactions were sorted in terms of absolute values of NSC, forming a rank of most influential reactions. The ones involving the intermediates highlighted by the flux diagrams were grouped for the sake of comparison with apparent kinetics."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Evaluation of the apparent kinetics,"3.1 Evaluation of the apparent kinetics The hydrogen uptake (3122 µmolH2·gcat −1) during temperature-programmed reduction measurements, carried out in the laboratory apparatus described above, was significantly higher than the theoretical one (2012 µmolH2·gcat −1), as a consequence of spillover phenomena, frequently described in the presence of noble metals (Baek et al., 2012; Han et al., 2020; Yentekakis et al., 2015). Pronounced catalyst reducibility was recorded, which is expected to strongly enhance the catalyst activity for OSR. Catalyst stability (Fig. 1 (a)) was evaluated for 100 h under a contact time of 120 ms, lower than the values commonly reported in the literature (Ruocco et al., 2019), which represents a stressful condition for coke formation and catalyst deactivation. Fig. 1 (b) reports the mean product concentration recorded at the beginning (first two hours) and the end (last 8 h) of the durability test. Whatever the selected reaction temperature, the bimetallic catalyst underwent deactivation and a stable performance was observed only up to 2 h of the test, after which a gradual decrease in ethanol conversion was observed. However, a lessened rate of catalyst deactivation was recorded with time-on-stream and, after almost 90 h, no more activity decay was recorded, with a stable behaviour observed for every investigated temperature. At the beginning of the test, almost complete ethanol conversion was observed in the whole investigated temperature interval; moreover, oxygen was completely converted and only H2, CH4, CO, and CO2 were produced. However, the results shown in Fig. 1 highlight how the reaction temperature strongly affected product selectivity as well as the rate of catalyst deactivation due to carbon formation: as expected, the maximum hydrogen production was recorded at 600 °C, due to the promoting effect of reforming reactions observed at a high temperature. Moreover, concerning the coke deposition during the reforming reaction, rising temperatures promote the formation of external carbon (i.e. carbon deposited on the external surface of the pore), which is less effective in pore blocking and determines a reduced extent of catalyst activity loss (Zhou et al., 2017). At the end of the test, the influence of catalyst deactivation was more pronounced at lower temperatures; as a result, the un-converted ethanol increased and acetaldehyde was also formed, thus negatively affecting hydrogen production. It was reported that increasing temperatures can assure higher rates of carbon gasification compared to the contribution of carbon accumulation, thus resulting in a reduced extent of catalyst deactivation (Coll et al., 2001). The Pt-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst was also tested at a lower contact time (24 ms), to drive the system very far from thermodynamic equilibrium and to properly carry out a kinetic study. Based on the experimental data collected in this work, an apparent reaction mechanism was proposed. This mechanism involved ethanol decomposition, methane oxidation, methane steam reforming, and water gas shift reactions. The reaction mechanism firstly involved the ethanol adsorption of the catalyst surface and its consequent decomposition to methane, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. The produced methane can be instantaneously oxidized to water and carbon dioxide (until the oxygen is completely consumed (Spallina et al., 2018)) and further converted through the steam reforming pathway. As presented in Fig. 2 , a fairly good agreement between the experimental and the predicted product distribution was observed, with a sum of the least-squares between the experimental and predicted concentrations of 0.03; the kinetic parameters related to the reactions included in the pathway were estimated from the Arrhenius plots as a function of the reaction temperature. The results are summarized in Table 1 . It is worth mentioning how the first reaction here reported can be intended as the result of two consecutive reactions, namely C2H5OH ↔ CH3CHO + H2 and CH3CHO → CH4 + CO, often considered representative of the investigated system (Sekine et al., 2010). These reactions can be considered as well-skipping reactions, representing a combination of elementary steps. In this view, the detailed kinetic mechanism was adopted for the following investigations."
6,Evaluation of catalysts effectiveness,"3.2 Evaluation of catalysts effectiveness To evaluate the effectiveness of the catalyst over time, the pseudo-steady-state compositions experimentally collected after 2 h (referred to as Fresh) and 92 h (referred to as Old) were compared with an equilibrium composition obtained by using the described kinetic mechanism. Additional data obtained in the absence of catalyst were added for the sake of discussion (Fig. 3 ). As expected, the fresh catalyst can lead the system to complete the conversion of ethanol (i.e., η approaching to zero), whereas after 92 h a significant amount of ethanol was measured at a temperature below 600 °C. This phenomenon indicates the occurrence of deactivation, especially at 400 °C, where the ethanol content approaches the value obtained by the homogeneous case. Similar deactivation effects can be observed for carbon dioxide production, whereas it has a limited impact on carbon monoxide content, suggesting that the presence of a catalyst provides an alternative route producing carbon dioxide. Catalyst deactivation involves, although slightly, the content of acetaldehyde in the product mixtures. However, both catalytic conditions provide considerably lower values than the homogeneous test, meaning that the primary reactions of acetaldehyde are less prone to be affected by catalyst activity and are considerably accelerated by its presence. This aspect can be of interest for the evaluation of the effect of a catalyst on the homogeneous reaction pathways and will be analysed in more detail in the following paragraph. It is worth noting that the water content is lower than the equilibrium value only in the presence of a fresh catalyst at a low temperature. This discrepancy can be attributed either to the condition making the steam reforming reaction disadvantaged or to the interactions between water molecules and catalyst surface accelerating the production of more reactive intermediates that consume water. This aspect, together with the geometry of its transition state (Monge-Palacios and Sarathy, 2018), suggests a possible increase in the production rate of small radicals such as HO2 in the presence of the catalyst. Although the equilibrium values for the hydrogen content are far to be reached, if the 400 °C case is excluded, the active catalyst has considerably higher efficiencies at all the investigated temperatures. This observation, together with the similar trend observable for carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, confirms that significant interactions affecting the kinetic of the CO + OH ↔ H + CO2, i.e., the ruling reaction for CO2 production, can be expected. Noteworthy, low temperature leads to negative η for methane, whereas the other conditions generate positive η , meaning that its production represents a bottleneck at low temperature. Besides, it is possible to conclude that methane production is activated, at first, due to the proximity of experimental values to equilibrium estimations, whereas it is prone to be reduced by catalyst deactivation, especially at low-temperatures where homogeneous and old catalyst give similar content. This tendency can be partially attributed to the reduced conversion of ethanol and acetaldehyde reported in these conditions."
7,Analysis of homogeneous reactive system,"3.3 Analysis of homogeneous reactive system Rate of production analyses were performed at different initial temperatures to evaluate the most relevant reactions paths characterizing the homogeneous reactive system. A schematic representation is given in Fig. 4 in the form of molecular structures. The black lines represent relevant paths for all the investigated temperatures, the blue lines indicate reactions characterizing low-temperature conditions, whereas the red lines indicate significant reactions at high-temperatures, only. The line thickness indicates the branching ratio. Besides, results obtained by means of sensitivity analysis under different initial conditions are reported in Fig. 5 . Hydrogen abstraction represents the primary reactions involving ethanol, in accordance with current literature (Marinov, 1999). Three different radicals, i.e., the ethoxy radical (CH3CH2O), 1-hydroxyethyl radical (CH3CHOH), and 2-hydroxy ethyl radical (CH2CH2OH), can be generated. Regardless of the condition, the first radical undergoes to double bond CO formation followed by β-scission, thus producing methyl radical and formaldehyde. Then, formaldehyde reacts to formyl radical and, eventually, carbon monoxide following the classical combustion theories (Ranzi et al., 2012). To the 1-hydroxyethyl radical is attributed the main reaction path for all the investigated temperatures. It consists of two consecutive reactions forming acetaldehyde as the main product, followed by parallel reactions leading to acetyl radical (CH3CO) and vinyloxy radical (CH2CHO) production. A comparison of the models available in literature provides an additional indication of the latter step. It has not been included in the flux diagram reported by Lee et al. (2012) and Lee et al. (2012) at low vacuum pressure, whereas analyses conducted at higher pressure have included this reaction among the relevant pathways (Olm et al., 2016; Millán-Merino et al., 2018), suggesting that a decrease in operative pressure may hinder the consumption of ethanol via this route. Acetyl radical is then transformed into the methyl radical and carbon monoxide or formaldehyde, whereas vinyloxy radical consumption to formaldehyde is significant at high temperatures, only. Subsequently, the chain termination reaction involving methyl radical, namely third body reaction, produces methane. Considering the initial reactants and final products, the sum of these elemental steps can be related to the apparent reactions C2H5OH ↔ CH3CHO + H2; CH3CHO → CH4 + CO, commonly considered in macro-kinetic investigations for the characterization of ethanol steam reforming (Sekine et al., 2010). Pondering the reactivity of the species included in this path, the rate-determining steps involve the hydrogen abstraction of ethanol and acetaldehyde, respectively. The achievement of equilibrium composition at 600 °C only, as observed in the section devoted to the evaluation of the effectiveness of the catalyst, can be partially attributed to the augmented relevance of the reaction forming vinyloxy radical and, consequently, formaldehyde. This observation is corroborated by the flux diagram reported by Millán-Merino et al. (2018) and Millán-Merino et al. (2018), where the consumption of vinyloxy radicals to formaldehyde was found to be negligible at 300 K. This path can be linked to the apparent reaction CH3CHO + H2O → CO + H2. On the other hand, the formation of acetyl radical via hydrogen abstraction of acetaldehyde may lead to formaldehyde at low temperatures or a methyl radical and carbon monoxide. The additional path affects the product distribution and can explain the lower content of methane to the equilibrium composition observed once the effectiveness of the catalysts were compared (Fig. 3). The consumption of 2-hydroxy ethyl radical formed by hydrogen abstraction from ethanol is strongly affected by temperature. At 400 °C, this radical may be further oxidized forming a hydroxy peroxyl radical (generically referred to as HOROO), which can, in turn, decompose in agreement with the reaction HOCH2CH2OO ↔ 2 CH2O + OH. Both aspects are typical of low-temperature combustion (Hashemi et al., 2016). Alternatively, double bond formation produces ethylene. Again, two different mechanisms can be distinguished depending on the operative conditions investigated. More specifically, hydrogen abstraction followed by triple bond formation giving acetylene (C2H2) was found representative of low-temperature mechanisms, whereas hydrogen addition with double bond-breaking forming propane was found representative of high-temperature mechanisms. This difference represents a key factor considering that acetylene is largely believed to be a precursor of carbonaceous substances (e.g. coke), whereas propane is significantly less reactive (Curran, 2019). This result explains the trend experimentally observed for the coke formation rate with respect to the temperature and the effectiveness of the catalyst in the reduction of net coke formation (i.e., the difference between deposited and gasified carbon). The microkinetic investigations performed by Sutton and co-workers on ethanol steam reforming in the presence of a catalyst have indicated that the formation of 2-hydroxy ethyl radical on catalyst surface is negligible even at a temperature below 400 °C (Sutton et al., 2013). This modification in branching ratio of primary reactions can be considered as a possible explanation of the suppression in coke formation since the flux diagram produced in absence of catalyst indicates the formation of 2-hydroxy ethyl radical as main responsible for the production of coke precursors. A further step toward more advanced understandings of the investigated reactive system can be done by means of sensitivity analyses on the detailed kinetic mechanism. For the sake of brevity, the normalized sensitivity coefficients of the most relevant primary reactions involving ethanol calculated for hydrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide as measurable were reported, exclusively. The validity of the reduced mechanism consisting of the reported reactions and the core mechanism (i.e., describing the C0, CH3, and CH2O chemistry) considered by Sarathy et al. (2012) was tested against the equilibrium data obtained by using the original version of the kinetic mechanisms (i.e., data reported in Fig. 3). Since negligible variations between the results obtained by the reduced and the detailed kinetic mechanisms were observed the reduced version was considered as validated and adopted for further analysis. The hydrogen abstraction of ethanol by OH or HO2 radicals represents the most impacting primary reactions under all the investigated conditions. Regardless of the produced radical and considered measurable, the hydrogen abstraction of ethanol by HO2 significantly affects the investigated reactive system only at 400 °C, explaining the trend reported for catalyst effectiveness of water to the temperature. At this temperature, the formation of CH2CH2OH radical via hydrogen abstraction by OH shows significantly lower NSC than the corresponding reaction involving HO2. This is particularly relevant when considering that HO2 is commonly associated with the low-temperature combustion mechanisms (Zádor et al., 2011) and the RoP analysis presented in this work indicated most of the reaction paths involving CH2CH2OH radical as relevant at low-temperatures only. It can be hypothesized that the surface of the catalyst interacts with the transition state, determining a different optimized geometry. Hence, the kinetic parameters of the reaction C2H5OH + HO2 ↔ CH2CH2OH + H2O2 can significantly affect the coke, ethylene, and formaldehyde production at low temperatures. It can be observed that the formation of the CH3CHOH radical, i.e., the starting point of the main branch indicated by the RoP analysis, shows similar absolute values of NSC for any given temperature and measurable. However, negative values were reported at 400 °C for the hydrogen abstraction by OH, meaning that an increase in the rate coefficient of this reaction leads to a decrease in hydrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide content. A possible explanation of this behaviour may be associated with the reduced availability of OH caused by a growth in C2H5OH + OH ↔ CH3CHOH + H2O rate, implying that OH radical plays an essential role in the activation of stable intermediate (i.e., acetaldehyde) forming the reported measurables. The apparent reactions consuming acetaldehyde, i.e., CH3CHO → CH4 + CO and CH3CHO + H2O → 3 H2 + 2 CO, can be related to the hydrogen abstraction CH3CHO + OH ↔ CH3CO + H2O, followed by the β-scission CH3CO → CH3 + CO, and chain termination of methyl radical forming methane; and the hydrogen abstraction CH3CHO + OH ↔ CH2CHO + H2O, followed by the β-scission CH2CHO → CO + CH3, and further oxidation formaldehyde and methyl radical largely investigated in combustion field (Battin-Leclerc, 2008), respectively. On the other hand, the hydrogen abstraction by HO2 has a positive NSC. This trend can be justified assuming that the reaction CH4 + HO2 ↔ CH3 + H2O2 dominates the activation of methane at these conditions. Higher rates of C2H5OH + HO2 ↔ CH3CHOH + H2O2 reduces the availability of HO2, with detrimental effects on methane consumption. This assumption agrees with empirical based apparent kinetics, where the reaction CH4 + H2O ↔ CO + 3 H2 is commonly included. Starting from these considerations, kinetic mechanisms for the oxidative steam reforming of ethanol resulting from different approaches were associated (Table 2 ). Zhang et al. (2013) and Zhang et al. (2013) have reported ab initio calculations for CH4 + HO2 ↔ CH3 + H2O2 showing activation energy equal to 103.13 kJ/mol (if adapted for n = 0). Comparing this value with the one obtained experimentally for the corresponding reaction (i.e., 48.34 kJ/mol), it is possible to conclude that the catalyst affects the activation energy by a factor of 2, meaning that its presence helps the formation of a transition state having lower energy. It considerably reduces the impact of the operative temperature on methane consumption. Under a similar assumption, i.e., n = 0, the apparent activation energy theoretically calculated by the same authors (Zhang et al., 2013) for CO + OH ↔ CO2 + H is considerably lower than the one obtained experimentally, namely 5.84 kJ/mol and 34.11 kJ/mol, respectively. This observation suggests that the production of carbon dioxide via carbon monoxide oxidation by hydroxyl radicals is considerably hindered by the presence of the catalyst, especially at low temperatures, possibly due to the promotion of competitive reaction paths."
8,Conclusions,"This work presents a detailed analysis of the chemical aspects involving hydrogen production via the oxidative steam reforming of ethanol. Catalyst deactivation was evaluated by comparing experimental measurements with or in the absence of a catalyst against equilibrium compositions deriving from a validated detailed kinetic mechanism. The latter was adopted for the individuation of the most relevant reaction paths under several initial temperatures using a rate of production analysis. The formation of ethoxy radical, 1-hydroxyethyl radical, and 2-hydroxy ethyl radical describes the primary reactions of ethanol in the absence of the catalyst. Regardless of the initial temperature, the reaction path deriving from 1-hydroxyethyl radical was found dominant. Coke formation was associated with the 2-hydroxy ethyl radical reaction path at low temperatures, explaining the effectiveness of the catalyst in coke suppression. The combination of sensitivity analyses and flux diagrams has made clear connections between micro and macro kinetics, allowing for the identification of the homogeneous reactions representative of the heterogeneous system. Starting from these considerations, theoretical methodologies for the calculation of rate coefficients (e.g. ab initio calculations) can be implemented to evaluate the effect of the catalyst surface on the transition state geometry of the highlighted reactions and, thus, include catalytic rates into the detailed kinetic mechanism."
