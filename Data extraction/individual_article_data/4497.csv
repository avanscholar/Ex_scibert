0,Introduction,"Biomass processing has been increasingly investigated to replace fossil-based productions [1]. Since 1st generation biorefinery compromises from food and animal feed productions, the sustainable biorefinery would involve integrated processes converting the non-edible biomass and waste/by-products [2], in agreement with the EU policy for “Phasing Out of Crop-based Biofuels by 2030” [3]. The main conversion routes involve gasification [4] or pyrolysis [5] followed by further synthesis or combined heat and power production (CHP). Some gasification studies involve the feedstocks of agricultural biomass char [6], lignocellulosic and algal biomass [7], citrus residue [8], torrefied wood pellets [9] and local agro-industrial residues [10]. The pyrolysis studies include both conversion of biomass to bio-oil [11] and upgrading the properties of bio-oil [12]. Some investigated feedstocks include terpenoid biomass [13], tobacco residue [14], corn stalks [15] and fruit pulp [16]. Another alternative route is the electrochemical route, such as the electrochemical degradation of biomass under hot compressed water to produce platform chemicals [17] and electrolysis of wet biomass to produce hydrogen [18]. Due to the high power consumption of water electrolysis, organics are investigated for hydrogen production through electrolysis. Among others, some examples are: glycerol [19], additional alcohols (being desired also as biofuel) and, more recently, lignin [20]. Pulp and paper industry is a major sector for biorefinery applications through alternative treatments of black liquor (BL) [21]. However, the commercial treatment involves combustion of BL in a recovery boiler, requiring energy-demanding evaporation [22]. For instance, BL combustion consists of around 12% of the whole CHP production in Finland in 2014 [23]. The electrochemical route has advantages of producing pure hydrogen and avoiding the conventional issues including corrosion and greenhouse gas emission [20]. However, high electricity consumption is the main obstacle for industrial application despite consuming less energy than water electrolysis [20]. The most investigated alternative is the thermal gasification of BL [24]. Despite reducing the carbon emission in a pulp mill [25], thermal gasification also requires an evaporation step, thus directing the investigations to hydrothermal treatments [26]. Partial wet oxidation (PWO) is a liquid-phase process occurring at moderate conditions of 100–320 °C and 0.5–20 MPa [27]. A review done by Kang and collaborators on hydrothermal conversion of lignin listed the studies on the conditions for the optimum aromatic aldehydes yields, maximizing lignin decomposition while minimizing further oxidation of aldehydes [28]. PWO of BL was investigated also for carboxylic acid production [27]. However, the outlet stream is so dilute that separation would be challenging [29]. Nevertheless, SCWG is potentially an efficient route for processing wet biomass [30]. A system analysis determined that replacing the recovery boiler treatment with SCWG in a pulp mill can reduce the energy consumption from 452.8 kg coal equivalent/ton of air-dried (ADt) pulp to 231.3 kg coal equivalent/ADt pulp [31]. The surplus of 221.5 kg coal equivalent per ADt pulp corresponds to 548.3 kWh of electricity; this would result in saving 118.4 kg CO2 per ADt pulp based on the standard emission factor of electricity in Finland [32]. As a comparison of two processes producing syngas, SCWG is more efficient than thermal gasification when moisture content of biomass is more than around 30% [33]. In addition, moisture content of feedstock does not affect the efficiency of SCWG whereas the efficiency of thermal gasification sharply decreases with moisture content [34]. Another advantage of SCWG is to produce syngas free of NOx and SOx [35]. Furthermore, SCW is an effective solvent for organics and gases, thus eliminating mass transfer resistances associated with dissolution and phase changes [36]. The studies on SCWG of BL include experimental investigations on the process conditions in various ranges. The main process conditions include temperature, residence time, feed concentration, catalyst and reactor material whereas pressure has only minor impact in the range of 23–29 MPa [37]. The gas yields and gasification efficiencies decrease with feed concentration and increase with temperature and residence time [38]. However, high temperature together with long residence time might increase char formation through re-polymerization [39]. The described impacts were also observed through the exergy analysis of hydrogen production from various biomass [40]. The reactor material influences the yields through catalytic impact. Quartz reactor can be considered as non-catalytic [41] while metals increase the gas yields and decrease char formation [42]. As determined by experimental studies in a quartz reactor [38] and metallic reactors [43], the yields and efficiencies were relatively very low at temperatures lower than 600 °C while increasing sharply with temperature [38,43]. In addition, Inconel reactor provided higher yields than stainless steel at high temperatures (600 °C or above) [43] while providing similar or slightly less yields than stainless steel at low temperatures around 400–500 °C [44]. In other words, the catalytic impact of metals depends on temperature. Similarly, the impact of residence time varies with the investigated range and other conditions. For instance, residence time in the range of 5–12 s had no major influence [45] whereas further increase up to 120 s provided enhanced yields with the composition favored towards hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane as well as less amount of heavier gases [38]. When gasifying BL-wheat straw mixture in Inconel reactor at 700 °C, the gasification efficiency increased with residence time in the range of 5–40 min, resulting mainly from enhanced yields of hydrogen and carbon dioxide [46]. However, very long residence time might be economically unfeasible due to high reactor cost. In addition, temperature can also slightly be increased considering the promoting impact on gas yields, e.g. to 750 °C while most studies conduct 650 °C or 700 °C as the maximum limit of the investigated temperature range. The preliminary techno-economic assessments can be conducted based on the experimental yield data to select the promising conditions for demo- and pilot-scale testing and implementation [47]. Although some simulation studies involved equilibrium calculations for the reactor outlet [48], equilibrium is not reached in a moderate residence time range regarding economic feasibility. A techno-economic assessment involving the residence time of 1.3–1.9 min presented promising results at 600 °C and 700 °C with stainless steel and Inconel reactors [47]. Nevertheless, it is worth investigating the impact of residence time as well. Therefore, comprehensive studies on SCWG of BL are needed investigating the inter-dependent impacts of process conditions under techno-economically promising ranges on thermal efficiency and product yields. Moreover, the solid deposition was illustrated as the main issue evidencing operational difficulties in tubular reactors [49]. The solid deposition and plugging were stated as open issues in a recent investigation on design and operational challenges of lab-scale reactors [50]. High content of salts worsens the risk of plugging, due to being insoluble in SCW [51]. Plugging occurs especially at the entrance of the reactor in continuous, isothermal operations due to negligible salt solubility already at the entrance. Together with continuous high-pressure feed, this causes the risk of reactor opening from the safety viewpoint. Instead, this study proposes a stepwise injection method (SIM) for feeding biomass into the reactor to address the plugging and reactor opening issues. SIM provides gradual transition to the reaction conditions, i.e. distribution of solids into the reactor rather than intensive deposition in the entrance. Nevertheless, the stepwise injection method should be carefully investigated in terms of operational and safety issues. Transport phenomena of heat, momentum and mass transfer should be studied together with structural investigations. Our research group has ongoing research on this matter. To sum up, further investigations are needed on: • comprehensive analysis on process conditions under promising ranges; • minimizing char formation; • addressing solid deposition causing plugging; • techno-economic assessment of SCWG of BL; • safety issues in relation to SCWG operations; • modelling of transport phenomena in the proposed transient conditions. The objectives of this study are to determine the inter-dependent impacts of process conditions (temperature, residence time and reactor material) and to address the plugging issue in lab-scale, tubular reactors with SIM as the operation mode. In addition, for a preliminary assessment, this study also proposes to compare the relative techno-economic performances of various sets of conditions based on kg non-inert yield, rather than kg dry or kg dry-ash-free basis, together with reaction time, reactor material and temperature. From the process development viewpoint, conducting the lab-scale experiments with SIM enables comprehensive and intensive investigations of process conditions prior to the demo- or pilot-scale investigations. In other words, the ranges of process conditions can further be narrowed down for pilot-scale experiments. The impacts of process conditions are assessed by investigating the product yields, char formation, reaction mechanism and energy efficiencies as well as the impacts on techno-economic performance. The previous results and mentioned research gaps have guided the selection of process conditions in this study: temperature range of 600–750 °C in Inconel and stainless steel reactors with moderate residence times (133–162 s as short and 300 s as long time). The results of this study are compared with various studies from the techno-economic viewpoint through product yields on kg non-inert basis together with reactor material and residence time: taking relative investment and operation costs into account as well. The results and comparison method of this study are useful to determine optimum conditions for CHP or hydrogen production."

2,Feedstock characterization,"2.1 Feedstock characterization The feedstock was weak BL derived from a mixture of 30% hardwoods and 70% softwoods. The characterization included elemental composition, dry matter, ash content and heating value. The ultimate analysis was performed with an elemental analyzer (CHNS) Flash EA1100 from ThermoQuest. The inorganic fraction was analyzed through ICP-MS technique. The dry matter content was determined by keeping the sample at 60 °C for 48 h, while the ash content was determined in a muffle at 950 °C in an atmosphere of static air. The high heating value (HHV) was measured with the 1341 Oxygen Bomb Calorimeter from Parr after oven drying and pelletizing the sample. Fig. 1 shows the pellet size used in this analysis. The received sample was diluted before the experiments from 26.4 wt% to 4.25 wt% dry content by adding distilled water. Table 1 shows the ultimate analysis and HHV. Despite the O/C and H/C ratios of 0.6 and 1.06, respectively, in the common range of woody biomass [52], the feedstock has a low HHV due to high ash content."
3,Process description,"2.2 Process description For this research, an entire room dedicated to SCWG experiments was arranged thanks to the collaboration between the Process and Systems Engineering unit at Åbo Akademi and a very large pulp and paper company operating in Finland. The room does not only comprise of the reactor setup and arrangements described as follows but also has special arrangements in regards to the safety of who is operating the experiments. Ventilation, alarms, switches and security measures have been designed and arranged for this research. When operating in continuous mode, operators do not need to enter the room for monitoring the experiments since all process parameters can be controlled by computer devices positioned outside the room space. The room has been equipped with a safety window and door to keep the space sealed in case of gas leakage or accidents. In particular, the process used in the present study could be classified to work in semi-batch operation with the adopted method, namely Stepwise Injection Method (SIM), to address the plugging problem. Fig. 2 shows the experimental system. The setup is composed of suitable pumps for injecting biomass into the feeding cylinders and for pressurizing the system with distilled water (1 and 1′), the feeding cylinders (3 and 3′) connected to the reactor (8) by means of on/off ball valves operated with a specific timing (4 and 4′), and the condensation section (9). In addition, pressure is maintained during the operation through a back-pressure regulator (10). Regarding process safety, two relief valves (2 and 2’) are placed on the top of feeding cylinders. The reactor outlet was collected into the sampling gas bag (11). The conditions are monitored through a pressure sensor (5) and three thermocouples located on the outer surface of the reactor at the inlet, in the middle and at the outlet (6). Data from these sensors are displayed on a computer screen (7) and recorded through a dedicated software developed with LabView™. The operation procedure involved start-up and biomass conversion stages. The system was first filled with water and pressurized to the target pressure. The reactor was brought to the experimental conditions at a gradual heating of maximum 140 °C/h to avoid thermal shock. After reaching the conditions, the feed cylinders were emptied, filled with the feedstock via ball valves and pressurized through the high-pressure pump. Then, biomass conversion stage started with feedstock being introduced to the reactor. The SIM was performed by injecting a constant amount of feedstock into the reactor every 20 s. After passing the condensation section and the back-pressure regulator, the products were collected into a sampling bag with valve and septum. The gas compositions were measured through gas chromatography. The accuracy of the SIM was verified through tests with water by measuring the volume pumped after 15 min. By opening the on/off valves (4 and 4’) every 20 s, the average mass flow rate was 2.1 g/min as shown in Fig. 3 . Despite a slight increase due to density change, the observed flow rate variation was less than 3% in the 200 °C range, particularly less than 1.7% at 600 and 700 °C. Consequently, assuming an average flow rate of 2.1 g/min with valve openings every 20 s, each valve opening transferred 0.7 g of feed to the reactor."
4,Equipment description,"2.3 Equipment description The high-pressure pump is a WellChrom® Pneumatic-Pump K-1900 from Knauer: a volumetric pump with double piston design and powered by pressurized air. The outlet pressure can be regulated through a control knob adjusting air pressure via a valve. The cylinders are made of Stainless Steel 316L with an internal volume of 500 ml each and designed for a working pressure of 400 bar. The reactors are made of Stainless Steel 316L (SS) and Inconel® 625, with an internal volume of 83 ml and a length of 50 cm, with the same shape and dimensions. The reactors are easily interchangeable in the setup. The oven model is Fibrothal from Kanthal, a cylindrical insulated casing with embedded heating elements mounted around the reactor. Heating is achieved through electrical resistances placed in the inner wall of the casing. The insulation material is ceramic fiber, and the oven can withstand temperatures up to 1150 °C. The maximum power is 2600 W, and an electronic control unit allows to regulate heating rate and to maintain the desired temperature. This work performed SCWG of BL applying the SIM at 600, 700, and 750 °C in stainless steel and Inconel reactors. Furthermore, short and long residence time were investigated for each reactor and temperature by varying the pumping intervals. Hereinafter, the experiments with pumping intervals of 20 s are indicated as “short residence time” experiments. The short residence time coincides with 162, 148, and 133 s at 600, 700 and 750 °C, respectively. Contrarily, the long residence indicates a constant residence time of 300 s for the all investigated temperatures, with different pumping intervals of 34, 42, and 45 s at 600, 700 and 750 °C, respectively."
5,Methods of data processing,"2.4 Methods of data processing The syngas yield is defined as the normal cubic meter of syngas per unit mass of dry feedstock [53] and obtained by direct volumetric measurement of syngas [54]. In addition, assuming ideal gas law, the individual gas yield is also calculated as shown in Eq. (1) as an example for hydrogen. (1) Y H 2 = m o l s y n ⋅ x H 2 m d r y f e e d The Carbon Conversion Efficiency (CCE) describes the ability of the process to convert carbon to the products, calculated for all the three phases as shown in Eq. (2). (2) C C E = m o l C g a s / c h a r / l i q m o l C f e e d 100 % Cold Gas Efficiency (CGE) determines the capability of a process to convert the embodied chemical energy of feedstock to the chemical energy of the syngas, as expressed in Eq. (3): (3) C G E = H H V s y n m s y n H H V d r y f e e d m d r y f e e d 100 % The energy efficiency ( η S C W G ) is calculated according to Eq. (4): considering energy input (denominator) for shifting the state of feedstock from the room conditions to the operating conditions ( Δ H B L ) , the enthalpy of reaction ( Δ H r ) , and the energy amount introduced with feedstock as heating value. Fig. 4 shows the simplified simulation scheme of the experimental operation. Both Δ H B L and Δ H r are divided by the combined thermal efficiency of the reactor and heat exchange ( η r t ), assumed as 0.85 in agreement with literature studies [55]. The heat supply to feedstock (QBL), the heat of reaction (Qr) and the recovered heat (Qrec) were obtained from calculations. The recovered heat involves the latent of water condensation and the sensible heat of water and syngas cooling from reaction temperature to 25 °C. The heat of reaction was computed using the enthalpy of formation of the main compounds involved in the process [30]. (4) η S C W G = m s y n H H V s y n + Q r e c m f e e d x s o l i d H H V d r y f e e d + ( Δ H B L + Δ H r ) ⋅ 1 η r t 100 % The enthalpy variation of the feedstock ( Δ H B L ) was calculated including the contribution of heating the dry solid and the enthalpy variation of the water in the feedstock, as in Eq. (5). The influence of pressure on the solid fraction has been neglected, while the enthalpy variation of the water is obtained from tabulated data [56]. (5) Δ H B L = m f e e d x s o l i d ⋅ ∫ T 0 T i C p d r y f e e d d T + m f e e d ( 1 − x s o l i d ) Δ h H 2 O The energy output (numerator in Eq. (4)) consists of the chemical energy in syngas ( m s y n H H V s y n ) and the heat recovered by cooling the outlet stream to the room conditions ( Q r e c ) . The latter is calculated according to Eq. (6) where Δ h H 2 O is the enthalpy variation of the incoming water and Y H 2 O represents the water fraction available at the outlet relative to the water entering the reactor, at least 97% as observed. Furthermore, a thermal recovery efficiency ( η t h _ r e c ) was assumed as 85% in agreement with literature studies [57]. (6) Q r e c = [ m s y n ⋅ ∫ T 0 T i C p s y n d T + m f e e d Δ Y H 2 O ( 1 − x s o l i d ) Δ h H 2 O ] ⋅ η t h _ r e c"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Brief description of the decomposition mechanism,"3.1 Brief description of the decomposition mechanism The hydrothermal decomposition of lignocellulosic biomass involves five main steps: depolymerization of polymers and oligomers, decomposition of monomers to intermediate compounds, gasification of these intermediates, equilibrium reactions among gases and reactions involving char and salts [58]. The overall decomposition schemes were described for lignin [39] and cellulose [59] as well as the detailed illustration of reactions [60]. The depolymerization results in the phenolics as lignin fragments and sugars including glucose, xylose, galactose, mannose and arabinose. In addition, glucose goes through isomerization reaction forming fructose as determined through glucose and fructose decomposition [61] and cellulose hydrolysis [62]. The hydrolysis reactions occur almost instantly under SCW conditions both for cellulose [62] and for lignin [63]. Afterwards, intermediate compounds are formed through further decomposition to lighter compounds and dealkylation reactions [64]. The intermediate compounds include acids, furfurals, aldehydes, phenols, aromatics and alcohols [65]. Then, reactions reforming these intermediates generates the desired gases, such as steam reforming and decarboxylation reactions. The equilibrium gas reactions include water-gas shift (WGS) and methanation reactions [66]. The reactions of solid phase include char gasification and repolymerization of phenolics with aldehydes forming char as investigated through lignin [39] and through the impacts of biomass constituents [67]. Nevertheless, nickel and noble metals hinder repolymerization and promote decomposition of aromatics as determined through SCWG experiments processing alkyphenol [68] and cellulose-xylan-lignin mixtures [69]. Referring to the alkali content of BL, sodium carboxylates reacting with water can produce gases and sodium carbonate, thus slightly contributing to the gas yields while converting some organic carbon to inorganic carbon [70]. The decomposition occurs through radical mechanism under SCW conditions [36]. However, despite the overall understanding, kinetic modelling currently has weaknesses due to complex phenomena: assuming reactions in 1st order, lacking the whole route or formulating lumped models, insufficiently representing temperature effect on rate constants [71]. Moreover, real biomass includes multiple, interacting constituents [72]. For instance, carbohydrates act as a hydrogen donor for lignin decomposition in SCWG of lignocellulosic biomass [69]. This causes the need of numerous experiments investigating the various combinations of process conditions for each biomass type."
8,SIM versus continuous feed flow in the experiments,"3.2 SIM versus continuous feed flow in the experiments In the continuous operation, the controller adjusts the heaters to maintain isothermal operation. Therefore, the feedstock is under reaction conditions immediately after entering the reactor, thus negligible salt solubility causing plugging already at the entrance and reactor opening. Moreover, the feed is at room temperature in case of experiments, thus causing some suspended solids already in the feedstock, although BL could go to the SCWG process directly from pulping unit, e.g. at 175 °C when SCWG being integrated with a pulp mill. In contrast, SIM provides gradual transition to the reaction conditions. After each feed injection, temperature at the entrance decreases first and then is adjusted back to the reaction temperature until the next injection. This temperature gradient results in gradual precipitation of salts and char on the reactor wall. Then, the accumulated char can partly react until the next injection despite the mass and heat transfer limitations due to fouling. However, the drawback of SIM is to compromise the gasification efficiencies since the beginning part of the reactor is not always at the reaction temperature. An alternative lab-scale design involves 75° vertical reactor with feed from down and gradual cooling section attached to the reactor: improved hydrogen yield from SCWG of isooctane with this reactor and cooling configuration together with introducing hydrogen peroxide for partial oxidation [73]."
9,Total gas yields as a measure of gasification kinetics,"3.3 Total gas yields as a measure of gasification kinetics Fig. 5 shows the total syngas yields. The Inconel reactor led to higher syngas yields than the stainless steel reactor, confirming more influencing catalytic behavior of Inconel. This implies that Inconel accelerates the reforming reactions of intermediates generating gases. The gas formation starts with decomposition of monomers and intermediates. For instance, Eq. (7) shows the steam reforming in general form while Eq. (8) shows an example of ethanol steam reforming. In addition, Eq. (9) shows the general form of decarboxylation. The reaction enthalpies are calculated with the formation enthalpies in the NBS tables [74]. The gas yields can be affected by the competition among the reforming reactions. Steam reforming results in carbon monoxide and hydrogen. In contrast, decarboxylation of heavy carboxylates (with more than two carbons) results in carbon dioxide while light carboxylates can generate also hydrogen and methane as shown in Eq. (10) and Eq. (11) for formic and acetic acids. Process conditions determine the relative dominance among steam reforming, decarboxylation of heavy carboxylates and decomposition to light compounds followed by decarboxylation. (7) C c H h O o + ( c − o ) H 2 O → c C O + ( c − o + h 2 ) H 2 (8) C 2 H 5 O H ( g ) + H 2 O → 2 C O ( g ) + 4 H 2 ( g ) Δ H 298.15 K o = 255.9 k J / m o l (9) R − C O O H → R − H + C O 2 (10) H C O O H ( g ) → C O 2 ( g ) + H 2 ( g ) Δ H 298.15 K o = − 14.9 k J / m o l (11) C H 3 C O O H ( g ) → C H 4 ( g ) + C O 2 ( g ) Δ H 298.15 K o = − 36.1 k J / m o l Under long residence time, the gas yields increased sharply with temperature in the whole temperature range of experiments, except stainless steel at 750 °C. Similarly, when the temperature increased from 700 to 750 °C with short residence time, the syngas yield increased from 0.29 Nm3/kgdryBL to 0.50 Nm3/kgdryBL for the stainless steel reactor and from 0.42 to 0.54 Nm3/kgdryBL for the Inconel reactor. However, temperature has a negligible effect on syngas yield when comparing 600 °C with 700 °C. This implies that short residence time at temperatures of 600–700 °C is insufficient and rate limiting. Inconel and stainless steel reactors provided close syngas yields at 750 °C with short residence time. This implies that the extra catalytic impact of Inconel over stainless steel decreases with temperature in short residence time. Similarly, close results of syngas yields between these two reactors were observed for long residence time at 700 °C. However, syngas yield decreased when temperature increased from 700 to 750 °C in stainless steel reactor with long residence time. This implies repolymerization of phenols with aldehydes. High temperature together with long residence time can cause more char formation through repolymerization [39]. In contrast, increasing temperature to 750 °C provided higher syngas yield for Inconel reactor with long residence time. This implies that Inconel promotes gasification reactions over repolymerization or gasification of repolymerized char. The impact of Inconel on repolymerization can be interpreted more clearly with the phase distribution of products, discussed later in this section. The maximum syngas yield was 0.77 Nm3/kgdryBL in Inconel reactor at 750 °C with long residence time as illustrated in Fig. 5."
10,Combustible gases versus carbon dioxide from the CHP viewpoint,"3.4 Combustible gases versus carbon dioxide from the CHP viewpoint Fig. 6 shows the high heating values of syngas, indicating the content of carbon dioxide versus combustible gases. Heating value of syngas was not influenced significantly by temperature in Inconel reactor with short residence time while increasing with temperature for stainless steel reactor. In other words, the fraction of carbon dioxide decreased with temperature for stainless steel reactor and short residence time while varying in a narrow range for Inconel reactor. This trend can also be observed in Fig. 7 showing the compositions of syngas. When applying long residence time, temperature the heating value increased sharply for both reactors with increasing temperature from 600 to 700 °C, while further increase in temperature did not have significant impact. In other words, carbon dioxide fraction decreased sharply from 600 to 700 °C and was not influenced significantly by further increase in temperature as observed also from Fig. 7. The reaction conditions for maximum CHP production would be long residence time, Inconel reactor and 750 °C, considering the highest syngas yield as shown in Fig. 5 combined with high HHV of syngas as shown in Fig. 6. From the techno-economic viewpoint, it is worth defining alternative conditions regarding the balance between high gas yield and cheaper investment. Considering stainless steel being a cheaper material, the stainless steel reactor is economically more feasible than Inconel reactor at the conditions providing close results. Therefore, alternative sets of conditions can include 700 °C and long residence time or 750 °C and short residence time with stainless steel reactor."
11,Gasification and gas-phase reactions,"3.5 Gasification and gas-phase reactions Gas compositions are useful for determining the impacts of conditions on decomposition mechanism. It was observed that more than 96 %vol of syngas consists of H2, CO2 and CH4. Carbon gasification occurs faster than hydrogen gasification as it can be observed from Fig. 7. The fraction of carbon dioxide was dominant at 600 °C temperature, except in Inconel reactor with short residence time, and reduced with temperature while hydrogen and methane increased in syngas. This indicates the dominance of decarboxylation of heavy carboxylates having as in Eq. (9) and decomposition reactions forming carbon dioxide at low temperature. In contrast, high temperature promotes the decomposition of monomers to lighter intermediates followed by decarboxylation (e.g. formic and acetic acids as shown in Eq. (10) and Eq. (11)), thus generating also methane and hydrogen. In addition, despite steam reforming of methane promoted by nickel at high temperature [75], increasing fraction of methane with temperature indicates that dealkylation is promoted over decarboxylation at high temperatures. This statement can be supported by the compositions resulting from Inconel reactor at 700 and 750 °C with both short and long residence times. Hydrogen fraction remained almost constant and carbon dioxide fraction reduced slightly while methane fraction increased with temperature. The same trends were observed also for stainless steel reactor with short residence time at 600 and 700 °C. In addition, for Inconel reactor, this composition trend together with increasing syngas yield implies reduction in solid fractions as shown later in this section, thus supporting the statement of promoted dealkylation with temperature. At all the investigated conditions, the fourth gaseous species was ethane, reaching only 2.8 vol% as maximum. Ethane can result from fructose decomposition through series of reactions first forming glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone followed by decomposition into pyruvaldehyde, lactic acid, acrylic acid then ethylene [76]. Then, ethylene reacts either with water to form ethanol or with hydrogen to form ethane, as shown in Eq. (12) and Eq. (13). Ethylene fraction did not overtake 0.9% and was less than ethane fraction in all the experimented conditions. (12) C 2 H 4 ( g ) + H 2 O ( g ) ↔ C H 3 C H 2 O H ( g ) Δ H 298.15 K o = − 45.5 k J / m o l (13) C 2 H 4 ( g ) + H 2 ( g ) ↔ C 2 H 6 ( g ) Δ H 298.15 K o = − 136.3 k J / m o l Once gases start to occur through decomposition, the equilibrium reactions take place among these gas species as well. The main equilibrium reactions include WGS and methanation reactions consuming carbon monoxide as shown in Eq. (14) and Eq. (15), respectively [77]. (14) C O ( g ) + H 2 O ( g ) ↔ C O 2 ( g ) + H 2 ( g ) Δ H 298.15 K o = − 41.2 k J / m o l (15) C O ( g ) + 3 H 2 ( g ) ↔ C H 4 ( g ) + H 2 O ( g ) Δ H 298.15 K o = − 206.1 k J / m o l The equilibrium of WGS reaction shifts towards carbon dioxide and hydrogen due to excess water. Regarding kinetics, this reaction is accelerated by alkali content of BL, thus resulting in negligible amount of carbon monoxide in syngas. The methanation of carbon monoxide is highly exothermic; therefore, high temperature can shift the reaction towards reverse direction, i.e. steam reforming of methane, and steam reforming is catalyzed by nickel as mentioned previously. This can be observed by comparing stainless steel and Inconel reactor at the conditions with similar syngas yield, i.e. short residence time at 750 °C and long residence time at 700 °C. In both cases, Inconel reactor gave slightly less methane fraction and more hydrogen fraction than stainless steel reactor as shown in Fig. 7. Another observation supporting the role of steam reforming of methane is hydrogen fractions over temperature. While the syngas yield increased from 600 to 700 °C with long residence time in both reactors, the fraction of hydrogen increased much more sharply in Inconel reactor than that in stainless steel. Similarly, with short residence time, the hydrogen fraction increased with temperature from 600 to 700 °C in Inconel reactor with a slight decrease in methane fraction despite promoted dealkylation. In contrast, methane fraction increased in stainless steel reactor from 600 to 700 °C with no change in hydrogen fraction while both hydrogen and methane fractions increased at 750 °C. The results show that temperature and reactor material have more impact on the composition than residence time. The residence time influences the extent of reactions, i.e. affecting the syngas yield, with relatively less impact on the composition through equilibrium gas reactions. Although temperature promotes the kinetics of the whole mechanism, the composition is influenced by temperature because of some steps being promoted more than others. The impact of reactor material becomes more influencing with temperature and residence time. For instance, the nickel-catalyzed reaction steps progress more extensively in Inconel reactor with higher residence time and temperature."
12,Gasification of char and salts,"3.6 Gasification of char and salts The reaction mechanism includes also solid formation as char or salts [78]. Char formation occurs through pyrolysis (dominant in thermal processes) and through repolymerization of phenolics (dominant in hydrothermal processes) [79]. SCWG of glucose (representing cellulose) and glucose/phenol mixtures illustrated that phenol (representing lignin) increases tar and char formation [80]. In addition, a kinetic study on lignin decomposition concluded that depolymerization occurs in 5 s, then cross-linking between degradation fragments occurs instantly [63]. Gas formation mainly occurs at the early stage of lignin decomposition, during the depolymerization step [81]. There are also studies investigated char and coke formation at molecular level [82] and from the kinetic modelling viewpoint [78]. When char occurs in the reaction mixture, the gasification of char also plays a role in the phenomena. For instance, dealkylation plays an important role in high amount of methane formation and trace amounts of ethylene and ethane. This can be briefly represented as in Eq. (16). In addition, Boudouard-Bell reaction occurs as in Eq. (17), of which the equilibrium shifts more on carbon monoxide formation at high temperatures [83]. Considering excess water and accelerated WGS reaction, this results in increasing formation of carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Other hydrogasification reactions occur as in Eq. (18) and Eq. (19), resulting in significant carbon monoxide fraction in the absence of alkali catalyst accelerating WGS reaction [84]. However, the presence of alkali can shift some organic carbon into inorganic salt while forming gases. For instance, Eq. (20) and Eq. (21) show the reactions of sodium formate and sodium acetate, respectively.

13,Char formation through repolymerization,"3.7 Char formation through repolymerization Referring to solid deposition and impacts of conditions on the reaction mechanism, it is useful to determine the product distribution into gas, liquid and char. A previous study showed that the liquid phase contained light carboxylates and alcohols as well as fragments of lignin including coniferyl alcohol, guaiacyl, ethers, pyrene and benzopyrene [43]. In addition, total organic carbon (TOC) decreased with temperature, and Inconel reactor resulted in less TOC than stainless steel [43]. In other words, the conversion of monomers and other intermediate compounds increase with temperature. However, this does not always ensure increase in gas yields. Fig. 8 shows the carbon conversions into all phases. Repolymerization has been mentioned before for the stainless steel reactor at 750 °C with long residence time. Compared to short residence time with the same reactor and temperature, more conversion to char was observed in the same extent with the reduction of gas. Similarly, comparing the short and long residence times at 600 °C in both reactors, long residence time resulted in more char and less gas. These trends indicate long residence time promoting repolymerization. In addition, the syngas yield and carbon dioxide fraction decreased while hydrogen and methane fraction increased in stainless steel reactor with long residence time at 750 °C compared to the same reactor and residence time at 700 °C. Fig. 8 also illustrates increasing conversion to char and decreasing conversion to gas in the same extent, with no change in the conversion to liquid. These trends indicate the promotion of repolymerization with temperature. In contrast, conversion to char decreases with temperature in Inconel reactor with long residence time, implying that Inconel promotes the gasification of phenolics over repolymerization. Inconel suppressing repolymerization can be stated also by comparing the conversions to char with short and long residence times in Inconel at 750 °C: long residence time resulting in much less char. It was also stated in the literature that transition metals suppress repolymerization by hydrogenating the active sites, promoting steam reforming and increasing the segmentation of long-chain molecules to short-chain ones [85]. Segmentation of long-chain molecules also increases the gas yields [86]. However, short residence time is insufficient for Inconel to suppress repolymerization. Short residence time resulted in the maximum conversion to char at 700 °C in both reactors, much higher than those with long residence time at the same temperature. Increasing temperature to 750 °C with short residence time decreased the conversion to char. However, both reactors resulted in similar conversion to char at this combination of temperature and residence time, thus confirming the lack of Inconel catalytic impact on suppressing repolymerization in short residence time. The high solid output indicates that further efforts are needed to increase the conversion to gas and to separate thedepositing solids. Individual gas yields provide relevant information for different downstream applications."
14,Downstream application – CHP and hydrogen production,"3.8 Downstream application – CHP and hydrogen production Fig. 9 shows the yields of carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane as the major species. The composition trends with short residence times at 600 and 700 °C are slightly different from the results of a previous study with close residence time, due to different feed concentration (4.25% in this study versus 12.3% in the previous study) [43]. The maximum hydrogen and methane yields were obtained in Inconel reactor at 750 °C with long residence time as 14.9 mol/kg and 6.6 mol/kg, respectively, under the same conditions selected for CHP production. The alternative conditions mentioned for CHP production are worth considering also for hydrogen production when evaluating techno-economic assessment: 700 °C with long residence time and 750 °C with short residence time in stainless steel reactor. In addition, Inconel reactor can be evaluated versus stainless steel reactor at 750 °C with short residence time due to more hydrogen yield which might compensate Inconel being more expensive, 8.8 mol/kg versus 10.2 mol/kg. Fig. 10 illustrates the Cold Gas Efficiency (CGE) under the investigated conditions. The CGE is affected from syngas yield and its composition (i.e. HHV). Therefore, the trends in CGE is consistent with the previous remarks on the selected conditions for further techno-economic assessment. The maximum CGE is reached in Inconel reactor with long residence time at 750 °C as a result of maximum syngas yield, 87.8%. The second highest CGE (around 65%) results from long residence time at 700 °C while short residence time at 750 °C also gives close value of CGE (around 60%). Since both reactors give very close results in CGE and the phase distribution, stainless steel is more economic option under these sets of temperature and residence time. Thermal efficiency has fundamental importance: counting also the energy demand of the feed reaching the reaction conditions and maintaining the reactor temperature as well as the energy recovery from cooling the reactor outlet. Thermal efficiency varies in a narrow range between 51 and 60% as shown in Fig. 11 due to dilute feedstock (i.e. high amount of water to heat and cool versus small amount of biomass reacting) although the trends are consistent with the previous remarks. Indeed, the most influencing terms are the energy required for heating the input stream and the energy recovered from cooling the output stream. The latter one cannot equalize the energy spent for heating the reactor despite increasing with temperature, as suggested by Eqs. (4)–(6). The maximum thermal efficiency was reached in Inconel reactor with long residence time at 750 °C. As stated before, the alternative sets of conditions can include stainless steel reactor with short residence time at 750 °C and with long residence time at 700 °C. From the process viewpoint, Fig. 12 shows a process diagram involving separate feed of wet biomass (Weak BL after passing through a heat exchanger) and recycling water (Recycling SCW) diluting the reactor inlet as well as two-stage separation of syngas (HP G/L Separator and LP G/L Separator). The reactor outlet is exposed to heat exchange with the recycling effluent and the weak BL before going to separation units. There is also excess heat just before the HP G/L Separator (Heat out). Since the temperature is not enough for generating high-pressure steam and electricity, this excess heat can be used as district heat [47]. The weak BL is heated to a temperature in a sub-critical region (e.g. around 350 °C) to avoid solid deposition in pipelines before the reactor. In addition, the recycling SCW is heated to a higher temperature so that the reaction mixture reaches the desired temperature. This heating can be achieved through flue gas due to very high temperature, i.e. compromising the electricity production. H2-rich gas is the main product for further usage: directly CHP production or purification of hydrogen and CHP production through off-gas. A techno-economic assessment conducted on these bases determined promising results and need for further investigations of process conditions [47]. From the techno-economic viewpoint for SCWG of biomass, the promising sets of conditions can be selected for a detailed assessment by simultaneously evaluating reactor inlet concentration, residence time, reactor material and temperature together with syngas yields. The reactor inlet concentration influences the extent of process stream flowrates relative to the processed organic content and produced syngas, i.e. affecting equipment sizes and hence the investment cost. Dilute reactor inlet causes larger equipment and more costs while improving the yields. For a process shown in Fig. 12, the major portion of investment cost is comprised by the reactor, heat exchangers and high-pressure phase separator [47]. The operation cost is affected also by the reactor inlet concentration, through electricity required by high-pressure pumps and heat required to reach the reaction temperature. Residence time influences the reactor size together with reactor inlet concentration. The reactor size increases with increasing residence time while improving the gas yields. However, long residence time together with high temperature can cause repolymerization in the reactor as mentioned before. Inconel suppresses the repolymerization and improves the gas yields also at high temperatures; on the other hand, an Inconel reactor with long residence time would increase the equipment cost more intensively than stainless steel reactor. To sum up, the criteria for optimum conditions can involve high temperature to promote the thermal efficiency, short residence time to reduce the reactor cost, high feed concentration to reduce the investment and operation costs. However, these conditions have constraints as well. Temperature must not violate the thermal stability of the reactor material, residence time should be sufficient to provide for high carbon gasification efficiency, and feed concentration should be moderate to introduce excess water as the reaction media. The optimum reactor material depends on other process conditions and gas yields. When comparing Inconel and stainless steel reactor, Inconel can improve profitability at high temperature despite being more expensive, because of providing higher syngas yields. In contrast, stainless steel is favorable at the conditions resulting in similar gas yields with Inconel reactor. In addition, heterogeneous catalyst can be inserted in case of yield improvements providing higher revenue than the cost of catalyst. When comparing various results in the literature, rather than yields on dry or dry-ash-free basis, it is useful to express the gas yields with respect to kg non-inert inlet to the reactor in order to involve also reactor inlet concentration in the comparison, considering water as non-inert and ash as the only inert constituent. Table 2 shows the reaction conditions and reactor outlets regarding energy content calculated through HHV of syngas and hydrogen production from various studies. Temperature promotes the energy yields as a consistent trend with gasification efficiencies. Increasing residence time in Inconel reactor also increases the yields sharply. For instance, the long residence time as 300 s provides remarkably higher energy and hydrogen yields than 133 s in Inconel reactor at 750 °C. In contrast to yields in dry-ash-free basis, very dilute reactor inlets cause very low hydrogen and energy yields in non-inert basis under as short residence times as 25 s, i.e. large equipment and high operating costs. Although the yields were improved when increasing the inlet concentration from 0.81% to 1.62%, a further increase to 2.43% reduces the yields sharply [87]. Increasing the residence time would increase the costs despite improving the yields. Moreover, in contrast to yield trends with respect to dry-ash-free feed, increasing the reactor inlet concentration improves the yields per kg non-inert when comparing this study with the study of Blasio et al. (2016) [43], i.e. reducing the investment and operation costs. Among the sets of conditions in Table 2, the optimum conditions can be concluded as Inconel reactor with the residence time of 77 s and 12.3% solid content in the reactor inlet at 700 °C because of providing maximum energy yield and close to maximum hydrogen yield in the non-inert basis. The yields of this set of conditions can be improved further by increasing the reactor temperature and slightly increasing the residence time. This set of conditions is more profitable also for hydrogen production than the same other conditions at 600 °C due to significant difference in the energy yield [47]. Similarly, the above-mentioned optimum set of conditions is more profitable than the same other conditions in stainless steel reactor because of remarkably higher energy yield, despite more expensive reactor [47]. As a result, the hydrogen and energy yields in non-inert basis are more informative for techno-economic potential although the yields in dry-ash-free basis provides information regarding the reaction chemistry. SCWG provides promising economic potential for processing wet biomass. A techno-economic assessment calculated the hydrogen production cost as 1.5 €/kg in an Inconel 625 reactor at 700 °C with 77 s residence time and as 2.1 €/kg in a stainless steel reactor at the same residence time and temperature: both sets of conditions with 12.3 wt% solid in the reactor inlet and processing 22.8 t/h solid in weak Kraft BL [47]. These results can further be improved by the optimization of the conditions with respect to the profitability measures. As a comparison, the hydrogen production cost was reported as 3–4 €/kg when assessing renewable hydrogen economy in Europe [88]."
15,Technology readiness level and future aspects,"3.9 Technology readiness level and future aspects Further research and techno-economic assessments are needed to commercialize SCWG of BL. A critical aspect for industrial application is the optimization of profitability measures with respect to process conditions. This aspect requires comprehensive analysis of all process conditions together through experiments, due to inter-dependent impacts of conditions and weaknesses in kinetic modeling. This study used selective ranges of temperature and residence time as well as effective reactor materials in a dilute reactor feed. Future comprehensive analyses can involve also feed concentration in a wide range, residence time in a wider range (e.g., 1–10 min) and catalyst. Heterogeneous catalysts can also promote gas yields and enable high yields at lower temperatures, thus reducing the needed heat for recycling water. Some heterogeneous catalysts include ruthenium, nickel, palladium and rhodium [89]. Nickel has relatively low cost among the transition metals while ruthenium is very active with low loading and at low temperatures [85]. Homogeneous catalysts can accelerate the decomposition reactions in the lab-scale tubular reactors with gradual heating, i.e. accelerating the decomposition when the ionic mechanism is dominant in the sub-critical temperature range. For instance, sodium hydroxide addition improved yields and efficiencies at the reactor temperature range of 600–700 °C in Inconel reactor with the residence time of around 25 s [87]. On the other hand, pH would not have significant impact at the mentioned reaction temperature range when applying the process configuration shown in Fig. 12. Instead, alkali metals can still catalyze the gas phase reactions, e.g. WGS reaction, under SCW conditions, thus resulting in negligible carbon monoxide yields when processing BL. As another critical aspect for the process performance, scaling up is another aspect regarding the catalytic impact of reactor wall. Since the gas yields changes with surface-to-volume ratio of the reactor, the experimental yields should be validated with pilot scale [90]. Alternatively, involving special reactor design for enhanced surface-to-volume ratio can ensure the gas yields consistent with lab-scale experiments. For instance, the vertical reactor with riser-tube can be modified to have multiple, coil-shape riser tubes. Besides addressing the solid separation, this would enhance the yields by increasing the surface area inside the reactor. In this case, the riser tubes would introduce the major part of surface area, rather than the vessel. Consequently, the vessel can be stainless steel to reduce the cost while the riser tubes can be Inconel to utilize the catalytic impact of this material. Regarding the technology readiness level, there is currently no commercial application of SCWG despite three pilot plants for other biomass types than BL [91]. One pilot plant is Verena plant in Germany, operating at 600 ᵒC and 28 MPa with the capacity of 2.4 tons of wet biomass per day [92]. The other pilot plant is in Hiroshima in Japan with the capacity of 1 ton of wet biomass per day and operating also at 600 ᵒC. The third plant is in Pacific Northwest Laboratory with the capacity of 0.6 ton of wet biomass per day, operating at around 400 ᵒC with metal catalysts. In addition, PSI process with the capacity of 24 kg per day was upscaled recently to 1.2 tons per day: involving a salt separator followed by SCWG reactor with fixed bed Ru/C catalyst and operating at 400–450 °C and 28–30 MPa [93]. Further improvements are needed to reduce the production costs through increasing thermal and carbon gasification efficiencies. Then, SCWG can be promising process for biomass conversion considering the advantages of SCW conditions. The main obstacles of SCWG include char formation in high extent and solid deposition in the reactor causing plugging [50]. This study illustrates carbon conversion to char as well, thus enabling the selection of process conditions with minimum char and maximum gas yields. Furthermore, heating rate is also an important parameter for tar and char formation [94]. Slow heating rate causes biomass decomposition in hydrothermal liquefaction conditions for longer time, i.e. more char and tar formation. Nevertheless, this can be addressed by feeding biomass and recycling SCW separately to the reactor, adjusting temperature of SCW to reach the reaction temperature when mixing with biomass at the reactor entrance. Other measures to reduce char formation include phenol addition and bimetallic catalysts. Phenol addition ensures complete dissolution of lignin and hinders repolymerization [39]. However, studies on SCWG of glucose [95] and xylose [96] determined that the presence of phenol decreases the conversion and gas yields. Nevertheless, BL has more lignin content than cellulose and hemicellulose; therefore, phenol addition might benefit to SCWG of BL. As an example of bimetallic catalyst, nickel-cobalt catalyst with magnesium-aluminum support (Ni–Co/Mg–Al) improved gas yields with reduced char formation [97]. The roles of catalyst components were summarized as nickel promoting fragmentation and gas phase reactions, cobalt inhibiting repolymerization, and the Mg–Al support promoting depolymerization and fragmentation [97]. This type of promotion addresses the catalyst deactivation due to char deposition and increases the catalyst lifespan as well. However, despite the possible reductions in char formation, solid deposition is inevitable also due to inorganic salts. SIM is useful to perform the experiments smoothly in a tubular reactor. This study used SIM in experiments and achieved the results; in contrast to the interrupted experiments in continuous operation [49]. However, SIM alone is insufficient to address the plugging issue in industrial processes since salts continuously accumulate in the reactor. The removal of solids will enable the recovery of valuable inorganics as well as preventing the plugging issue. PSI process includes salt separator prior to the reactor [93]. Some studies on salt separation proposed vertical pressure vessel with dip-tube or riser-tube configuration operating at just above critical temperature (e.g. around 400 ᵒC) [98]. This provides separation of Sulphur as well, thus avoiding catalyst poisoning and hydrogen sulphide in the syngas [98]. Alternatively, since alkali metals also catalyze the reactions, the process can be more efficient with a reactor simultaneously enabling the salt separation. For instance, Verena pilot plant involves a vertical reactor with different inlet and outlet configuration [92]. The inlet is at the top and flows downwards in the reactor. Then, a riser-tube is used to collect the gas product flowing upwards while precipitated solids are collected from the bottom. With a special reactor sufficiently separating the solids, SCWG can operate with the continuous feeding to maximize the gasification efficiencies. To sum up, SCWG can be operated for various biomass feedstock including agricultural residues with the approaches of PSI process (salt separation prior to the reactor) and Verena pilot plant (separating the solids in a vertical reactor). On the other hand, Kraft BL has high alkali and lignin content, causing solid deposition and char formation. Therefore, as a future aspect, these approaches should be validated with BL as well in a pilot-scale operation despite presenting promising solutions to the solid deposition issue. Another future aspect can be to investigate the physical-chemical properties of char and the impacts of these properties on the process. The reactivity of char formed in thermal gasification has been investigated in terms of textural, structural and chemical properties [99]. However, the char from thermal gasification is polyaromatic char formed through pyrolysis whereas SCWG generates phenolic char through repolymerization of phenolics and aldehydes [39], thus potentially having different reactivity. In addition, particle size plays important role for gasification reactions in the solid surface and for heat and mass transfer: the smaller size is the higher surface area and the more close-to-uniform intra-particle temperature [100]. The char formed in SCWG is potentially be influenced by the molecular size of lignin content. Future studies can investigate the impact of lignin molecular weight in feedstock on the char and gas yields. For instance, PWO reduces the molecular weight of lignin fragments in BL [101]. PWO can be a prior step to SCWG for decomposing the lignin content into smaller fragments. Further development continues also on long-time operation aspects, crucial for industrial application: catalyst deactivation and corrosion of the reactor wall. Despite high activity and moderate price, deactivation is an issue for nickel heterogeneous catalysts [91]. One reason of deactivation is sintering of a heterogeneous catalyst [85] while the adsorption of intermediates to the catalyst surface was also observed as the other reason at 400 °C [102]. Among the metal catalysts, ruthenium has high activity and stability in SCW meanwhile this catalyst is expensive [91]. Some effective measures to reduce deactivation of nickel include involving support (such as alumina or magnesia) or coupling with another metal as bimetallic catalyst (such as ruthenium or cobalt) [103]. Therefore, Inconel reactor wall can be resistant to deactivation as the alloy of nickel, chromium and molybdenum. This is to be experimented with long-time operations. In addition, deactivation can be reduced also through enhanced dispersion of active sites on support as determined with ruthenium catalyst [104]. Corrosion has also been investigated as the other aspect. The main factors affecting corrosion are the reactor material, feedstock content and temperature [105]. The electrochemical corrosion occurs through ionic species, and dissociation constant of water reaches the maximum around critical temperature and decreases with temperature at supercritical phase. Therefore, SCW conditions at high temperature (e.g. 600 ᵒC or more) are less corrosive than hot-compressed water around critical temperature. A study performed at 400 ᵒC with 16 h of residence time compared stainless steel, Inconel and ceramic reactors [44]. The ceramic reactor was more stable than Inconel and stainless steel; however, the product gas had more hydrocarbons and less hydrogen. Although another study observed corrosion on Nickel alloy reactors also at higher temperatures [106], stainless steel and Nickel alloys (e.g. Hastelloy and Inconel) were stated to be corrosion resistant materials by other reviews on SCWG of biomass [89] and on corrosion control in SCWG [105]. In addition, the pilot plant in Japan operates at 600 °C without corrosion issue, made of stainless steel [91]. The forms of corrosion and corrosion control methods were also investigated in detail [105]. The other corrosion forms depend on the feedstock content: e.g. dealloying due to alkaline or sulfide, and under-deposit corrosion due to salt fouling. The main corrosion control approach currently involves the optimum selection of reactor material and process conditions. The knowledge on this aspect can be enhanced through comprehensive investigations on the impacts of temperature, reactor material and feedstock content on different forms of corrosion. The stability of reactor material is another aspect to be considered under the SCWG conditions. Inconel material has good thermal stability and used in industrial applications at temperatures even over 1000 °C. However, despite successful operations in the experiments of this study, stainless steel 316L was reported to be stable only up to 650 °C in terms of ductility, yield strength and microstructure [107]. Nevertheless, different variations of stainless steel have thermal stability over higher temperatures up to 1150 °C through adjusted ferric and chromium content [108]."
16,The integration of SCWG to pulp mills,"3.10 The integration of SCWG to pulp mills Once becoming mature technology, SCWG can be integrated with pulp mills to achieve multi-product biorefineries by processing a part of or all the black liquor. In addition, this technology can also enable the operations of non-wood mills. Despite having the same organic constituents with slightly less lignin, due to high silica content causing very sharp increase in viscosity, non-wood BL can be concentrated only up to 50% regarding flowability or requires a silica removal operation [109]. However, the recovery boiler treatment then becomes economically unfeasible. Therefore, this study is also informative regarding non-wood BL, although experimenting non-wood BL is necessary for the integration to non-wood mills. For instance, there are also studies specifically on SCWG of wheat straw BL at low temperatures (400–600 °C) with short residence time (5–14 s) [45] and at high temperatures (600–750 °C) with long residence time (10–50 min) [110]. From the process integration viewpoint, separation and/or post-processing of syngas plays an important role to determine the overall efficiency. The techno-economic study used the process configuration shown in Fig. 12 to calculate profitability of producing CHP or co-production of CHP and hydrogen, with the additional PSA to hydrogen-rich gas for hydrogen production [47]. Alternatively, stating that PSA is an energy intensive separation, syngas chemical looping (SCL) was investigated to produce hydrogen and CHP with higher energy efficiency and carbon capture performance [111]. Another option is to produce ammonia and CHP through SCWG followed by SCL, considering the benefits of ammonia regarding the storage [112]. SCL involves three steps in separate reactors: reducer, oxidizer and combustor. In the reducer reactor, syngas reacts with an oxygen carrier to form steam and carbon dioxide. The reduced oxygen carrier reacts with steam in the oxidizer reactor to produce hydrogen. The outlet of this reactor is hydrogen and unconverted steam, from which pure hydrogen can be obtained by condensation. In the combustor reactor, partly oxidized oxygen carrier is oxidized further to the initial state as well as a part of syngas being burned for producing hot flue gas. Electricity is produced by expanding the hydrogen-steam (oxidizer outlet) mixture before condensation and carbon dioxide-steam mixture (reducer outlet). The advantages of SCL include enhanced energy efficiency and pure hydrogen product; on the other hand, this option introduces three additional reactors and more auxiliary equipment. As a future aspect, the integrated process as in Fig. 12 with PSA for hydrogen production can be compared with SCWG followed by SCL in terms of profitability measures through an economic feasibility analysis. The process can be improved further regarding feedstock variety, Sulphur recovery and energy efficiency. The energy efficiency can be improved by PWO prior to SCWG, heating up the feedstock and partly decomposing into smaller fragments. In addition, a part of PWO downstream can go through acidification to recover lignin as a product, i.e. the LignoForce process [113]. The residual liquid of acidification and the other part of feedstock can go the SCWG reactor. Moreover, the product spectrum can include also bio-oil through parallel reactors for SCWG and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). Similar to SCWG being more efficient than thermal gasification, HTL is more effective than pyrolysis for wet biomass and producing bio-oil with less oxygen content [114]. Regarding Sulphur, a study on heteroatom compounds illustrated that calcium hydroxide can reduce hydrogen sulfide gas to one tenth compared to SCWG without calcium hydroxide: more Sulphur in oxidized ion form in aqueous effluent or sulphate salts [115]. In addition, oxidized Sulphur does not reduce to sulphide at temperature less than 900 °C [116]. Therefore, PWO oxidizing also the Sulphur content prior to SCWG can enable Sulphur-free syngas, thus eliminating gas cleaning need for post-processing [117]. Avoiding sulphide in the reactor is beneficial also for preventing corrosion through dealloying. In addition, since Kraft pulp mills use sodium sulphide as a pulping chemical, the recovery of Sulphur is an important aspect for integration without the need of chemical make-up. The oxidized Sulphur can be reduced to sulphide form in the recovery boiler when the solid residue is recycled to this unit. Furthermore, such an integrated facility can also process other biomass wastes: e.g. SCWG of corn and potato starch gels [106], microalgae [118], glycerol [119], manure [120], sewage sludge [121], fruit pulp [122], fruit wastes and agro-food residues [123], olive mill wastewater [124], and BL mixed with wheat straw [46]. This will improve economic and environmental performances of other biomass sectors as well. This concept was introduced as sectoral integration [117]: supply chain networks with multi-feed-multi-product conversion processes utilizing waste streams of various biomass sectors. Especially, farmers would be integrated more intensively with the sustainable biorefinery, and food and energy needs would be addressed simultaneously [72]. Another important aspect is to utilize waste or by-products of the process. SCWG of BL introduces by-product streams namely, “Brine and char”, “Aqueous discharge” and “CO2-rich gas” as labeled in Fig. 12. Solid separation in the reactor will enable the recovery of pulping chemicals and the chemical energy in char by recycling the solid residue to the recovery boiler. The other two streams are in the concern from the environmental management viewpoint. In a previous study of De Blasio et al. (2016) [43], the liquid effluent was stated to have higher TOC than the allowed limits for industrial wastewater discharge. The aqueous discharge can be treated in the existing wastewater treatment facility in the integrated pulp mill or in another treatment unit, such as wet oxidation. As the gas by-product, CO2-rich gas can be utilized as further integration, e.g. transferring this gas to a algae growth facility or using carbon dioxide for acidification of black liquor to precipitate lignin as another product option."
17,Conclusion,"Pulp and paper industry has a major potential for biorefinery through alternative treatment for black liquor. Among the investigated alternatives, SCWG has beneficial features of avoiding evaporation and effective solvent media for organics and gases, thus being more energy-efficient than thermal gasification and the commercial treatment. From the phenomena viewpoint, the previous studies illustrated the impacts of process conditions on product yields and reaction mechanism as well as some comprehensive studies investigating very wide ranges of process conditions. On the other hand, from the techno-economic viewpoint, comprehensive investigations are needed on the impacts of the whole set of conditions specifically on the promising range of each condition. In addition, solid deposition is a major issue causing catalyst deactivation and plugging. This can be addressed through the optimum process conditions minimizing the char formation and special design enabling solid separation. This study investigates the inter-dependent impacts of process conditions on the product yields, char formation and reaction mechanism from the phenomena viewpoint as well as the impacts on the energy efficiencies and techno-economic performance from the process viewpoint in SCWG of BL. The experiments of this study investigate the impacts of residence time, temperature and reactor material at the promising ranges of these conditions with constant feed concentration. Afterwards, this study compares the results with other studies involving also various feed concentrations from the techno-economic viewpoint by evaluating the yields in non-inert basis together with residence time and reactor material. Temperature and residence time promote gasification reactions; however, high temperature together with long residence time causes more char formation through repolymerization. Nevertheless, Inconel has catalytic impact for suppressing repolymerization and provides higher yields at high temperature with long residence time. The results show that Inconel reactor at 750 ᵒC with long residence time is the optimum set of conditions resulting in the highest thermal efficiency and hydrogen yield among the conditions investigated in this study. The alternative conditions for techno-economic assessment include 700 °C with long residence time and 750 °C with short residence time in stainless steel reactor. Further comprehensive investigations can include feed concentration and heterogeneous catalyst as well. Then, process conditions can be selected by optimizing profitability measures when designing industrial process. In addition, comparing the yields in the non-inert basis provides more accurate evaluation of techno-economic potential than the dry or dry-ash-free basis by implicitly assessing the relative investment and operating costs as well. This comparison determined that increasing the reactor inlet concentration can improve the gas and energy yields in non-inert basis at moderate residence times, thus improving the economic performance. This study also investigates SIM as an operation mode to address the plugging and reactor opening issues in the lab-scale, tubular reactors. SIM reduces the risk of reactor opening by generating temperature gradient in the reactor and by giving time for injected material to react until the next injection. Therefore, char and salts are more dispersed over the reactor, rather than intensive and instant deposition in the entrance. The experiments in this study have been conducted without operational issues through SIM. In other words, SIM facilitates the SCWG experiments in lab-scale, tubular reactors. More experiments can be conducted through SIM in the lab-scale for scientific investigations. In addition, the injection intervals can also be investigated as a future aspect regarding the transport phenomena involved. This would concern heat, mass and momentum transfer. The injection interval was 20 s in all the presented experiments in this study. Considering that the depolymerization of lignin occurs in 5 s, SIM with shorter injection intervals and less injection mass can also be investigated for a close-to-continuous operation without compromising the safety regarding reactor opening. Consequently, the promising ranges of process conditions can be selected more accurately for further investigations in pilot- or demo-scale and for industrial applications with special reactors enabling simultaneous salt separation. Biomass processing requires improvements also on the integration concepts. SCWG can also be a part of a multi-feed-multi-product process utilizing also other biomass wastes and producing multiple products flexibly. Multi-feed-multi-product processes can improve the supply chain by enabling the sectoral integration as well as improving the economic and environmental performance of other biomass sectors."
