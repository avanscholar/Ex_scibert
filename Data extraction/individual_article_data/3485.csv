0,Introduction,"Benzaldehyde (BzH) is considered as one of the most elementary aromatic aldehyde that can be naturally found in almonds, apricots, apples, cherry kernels etc. Recent years have seen a huge surge in the market demand for BzH due to its versatile applications as platform chemical in the pharmaceutical, dyestuffs, perfumery, and agrochemical industries [1,2]. The prevalent methods of BzH production mainly relies on (1) hydrolysis of benzyl chloride and (2) oxidation of toluene, both of which are environmentally hazardous since they generate chlorine contamination and requires high heat (500 °C) leading to poor selectivity [3–5]. Therefore, recent progresses to synthesize BzH have been investigated using selective oxidation of BzOH (benzyl alcohol). Due to their distinct advantages of efficient contact, the homogenous catalysis of BzOH (benzyl alcohol) to BzH have exhibited high activity and selectivity [6–8]. However, the post-reaction separation, purification, and recovery process in homogeneous catalysis not only increases the economic cost, but also inappropriate solvent disposal generates pollution problems. Hence, heterogeneous catalysis has been highly desirable due to their ease of separation, efficient purification, recovery, and reuse. Various noble metals (Pd, Pt, Au, Ru, Ag, etc.) have been investigated as heterogeneous catalyst for selective oxidation of liquid phase BzOH (benzyl alcohol) to BzH [9–11]. In order to attain the best performances, such reactions have predominantly used different extractive solvent mediums for BzH and additives such as para-xylene [12], acetonitrile [13–15], water [16], toluene [16–18], oxidants (such as TBHP--tertiary butyl hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, O2) [13,16,17,19,20], external weak and strong bases such as carbonates and hydroxides) [18,21], and high pressure condition [16,22,23]. However, these extractive solvents and additives often contradict with the green sustainability approach due to their post-reaction complex purification processes and generation of pollution. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a “greener” approach to synthesize BzH in solvent-free reaction medium, with molecular oxygen-based oxidants, and at lower temperature and atmospheric pressure condition [24–26]. This is what our current work aims at. Though noble metals are highly active for selective oxidation of BzOH (benzyl alcohol) to BzH, but are highly expensive, and on their oxides present low surface area and high percentages of the noble metal, therefore it is a rational strategy that dispersing them on high surface area nanostructured porous support, will not only reduce their usage quantity, but also improve the overall textural properties of the heterogeneous nanocatalysts. Furthermore, the metal-support interaction might not only enhance the performance and stability of the catalysts but also make the noble metal catalysts become recyclable and reusable [27]. However, since noble metals are expensive, care should be taken for their maximum recovery during separation and recycling. Conventional filtration and centrifugation method for separation expose nanocatalysts to structural pulverization, stability issues, and quantity loss. Recently, magnetically separable nanocatalysts (MAGSNC) have garnered attention due to their non-destructive and highly efficient approach to separate and recover nanocatalysts for further reuse [28]. Various MAGSNCs such as monometallic nanoparticles (Fe, Co, Ni), alloys (FePt, CoPt), iron oxide (FeO, Fe2O3, Fe3O4), ferrites (CoFe2O4, MnFe2O4, CuFe2O4, ZnFe2O4) have been synthesized either by coating magnetic nanoparticles with non-magnetic porous supports to form magnetic nanocomposites [29–31], or by synthesizing catalytic supports with magnetic materials [32]. However, functionalization of catalytic materials with magnetic nanoparticles to obtain magnetic nanocomposites still remains relatively unexplored. To address the above issues, this work has used SBA-15 as the porous support, functionalized it with Co nanoparticles to obtain a functionalized magnetic support, followed by loading Pd as the active catalytic sites. Such a magnetic nanocomposites will be used as the catalyst for selective oxidation of BzOH to BzH by molecular oxygen oxidant at 70−90 °C. It is noteworthy that this work adopts a solvent-free approach for the reaction, with no extra addition of extractive solvent. We have selected SBA-15 as the porous support due to its high specific surface area (>700 m2/g), mesoporosity with relatively large pore diameter (6∼8 nm), and excellent hydrothermal stability [33]. To overcome the non-ferromagnetic feature of SBA-15, iron nanoparticles were functionalized on mesoporous SBA-15 by a solvent-less mechano-chemical method [34]. On the other hand, though cobalt nanoparticles16 have exhibited promising magnetic properties in one-dimensional assembly, microwave absorption material, and negative contrast agent, there are only few studies of their magnetic and synergistic catalytic features for aqueous coupling reactions [35–39]. Hence, we have developed an alternative MAGSNC by functionalizing the SBA-15 with Co (CoMagSBA) by simple ball milling method. As already discussed, that noble metals are highly active for the selective oxidation of BzOH to BzH, therefore Pd has been doped on CoMagSBA by ball milling followed by hydrogenation. In summary, this work features not only benign solvent-free reaction conditions for the selective oxidation of BzOH to BzH, but also adopts a facile ball-milling method to synthesize the heterogeneous catalyst."
1,Experimental,
2,Cobalt oxide functionalized SBA-15 (CoMagSBA),"2.1 Cobalt oxide functionalized SBA-15 (CoMagSBA) A total of 0.5 g preformed solid SBA-15 silica support (ref) was ground with appropriate amount of Co(NO3)2•6H2O in a RETSCH PM-100 planetary ball milling machine using 25 pieces of 10-mm marbles in a 125-mL stainless steel vessel. The ball milling duration was 30 min at 350 rpm. The obtained product was dried at 100 °C/12 h and heated up to 300 °C under air at 1 °C/min and kept for 6 h. The resulting magnetic nanocomposites were denoted as 30CoMagSBA (30 wt.% of Co), 23CoMagSBA (23 wt.% of Co), 17CoMagSBA (17 wt.% of Co), and 12CoMagSBA (12 wt.% of Co). The other catalysts, 20MnSBA, 20CuSBA, and 20ZnSBA, were prepared in a similar way but with different metal and loadings. Briefly, 0.5 g solid SBA-15 was ball-milled for 30 min at 350 rpm with 20 wt.% of Mn(NO3)2·4H2O, Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O, and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O accordingly. The obtained product was dried at 100 °C/12 h and heated up to 300 °C under air at 1 °C/min and kept for 6 h."
3,Palladium doping on the CoMagSBA material by impregnation,"2.2 Palladium doping on the CoMagSBA material by impregnation Appropriate quantity of palladium (II) chloride precursor solution was added dropwise into the CoMagSBA powder. The mixture was stirred continuously for 20 min to ensure that PdCl2 precursor solution had diffused into the pores of the CoMagSBA. The obtained products were dried in an oven at 100 °C/12 h and calcined at 300 °C/3 h under hydrogen. The final nanocomposite catalysts were named as xPd/yCoMagSBA, where x and y denote wt.% of Pd and CoMagSBA respectively."
4,Characterization of the developed catalysts,2.3 Characterization of the developed catalysts The developed catalysts were characterized using X'Pert Pro (PANalytical) X-ray Diffractometer (XRD) with Cu Kα radiation and Kratos x-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The N2 physisorption was conducted in Coulter SA 3100. The CO2-TPD was conducted in an in-house set-up. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and angle annular dark field high (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images were observed and elemental mapping analysis were performed by an electron microscope (Phillips Analytical FEI Tecnai 30) at the accelerating voltage of 300 kV.
5,Catalytic evaluation of the developed Pd/CoMAGSBA,"2.4 Catalytic evaluation of the developed Pd/CoMAGSBA Liquid phase oxidation of BzOH by molecular oxygen was conducted in a three-neck flask (10 mL) equipped with a magnetic stirring and a reflux condenser, which was placed in an oil bath. For each experiment, 0.05 g catalyst was added into 10 mL BzOH (99.99 %) with continuous oxygen bubbling (controlled by a glass rotameter) at 90 °C and atmospheric pressure. Samples were extracted periodically by a syringe from the reaction mixture and the used catalysts were separated by centrifugation from the liquid effluent. The products were analyzed by a gas chromatography equipped with the FID detector (SE-30 capillary column). The BzH selectivity is defined as the ratio of the amount of BzH produced to the amount of BzOH consumed [40]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Physicochemical characterizations of the developed catalysts,"3.1 Physicochemical characterizations of the developed catalysts The XRD pattern of CoMagSBA in Fig. 1 , indicates that the peaks at 31.4°, 37.0°, 45°, 60°, and 65.4°, corresponding to the (220), (311), (400), (511), and (440) Millers indices belong to the crystalline Co3O4 nanoparticles. However, there were no diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern of Pd/CoMagSBA. In order to understand if this phenomenon is caused due to H2 reduction or Pd doping, 17CoMagSBA was reduced under hydrogen, and its XRD pattern showed no indicative peaks of Co3O4. Hence, it was concluded that during H2 reduction, both PdCl2 and Co3O4 gets reduced to form Pd and CoO respectively. The same has been corroborated by XPS. The XRD patterns of xPd/yCoMagSBA catalysts after H2 reduction are featureless because of the amorphous structure of CoO. The tiny nanoparticles of CoO are smaller than X-ray coherence length, which made them difficult to distinguish. Diffraction peaks of Pd could not be detected because Pd doping quantity was too small and that resulted in a uniform dispersion of the Pd nanoparticles on the CoMagSBA. In Fig. 2 , for the 4Pd/17CoMagSBA catalyst, the peaks of Co 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 are located at 780.5 eV and 796.4 eV respectively, at a spin-orbit splitting distance of ΔE = 15.9 eV, which confirms the presence of Co2+ ions. Further, the two satellite peaks at 786.7 eV and 803.5 eV for Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 respectively indicates the presence of CoO [41–43]. The morphology of the catalysts was characterized by TEM-EDX. Fig. 3 (a–c), show that in 17 CoMagSBA, nano-sized cobalt wires were formed in the mesopores of SBA-15, which were geometrically well aligned along the pore channels. However, increasing the loading of Co in 20CoMagSBA and 23 CoMagSBA cause filling up of the mouth of the pore channels. Hence 17CoMagSBA was selected as the best support in subsequent experiments. Fig. 3(d–g) show that in the 20CoMagSBA and 23CoMagSBA, the higher concentration of palladium nanoparticles were deposited and assembled with aggregation near the pore mouths, in contrast to the uniform Pd dispersion achieved in 3Pd/17CoMagSBA and 4Pd/17CoMagSBA, due to successful impregnation of Pd atoms in the SBA -15 network. It is to be noted that in all the cases, the morphology of SBA-15 was retained indicating their robustness during the xPd/yCoMagSBA synthesis. Fig. S1 shows the N2-sorption isotherms, where the Type IV adsorption isotherms with H1 hysteresis loop of SBA, CoMagSBA, and Pd/CoMagSBA, demonstrate their mesoporous structure. BJH Pore size distributions, (insets of S1(a)-(h)), exhibit that the catalysts have narrow pore size range of 6−8 nm. The isotherm and hysteresis loop of the catalysts remain similar even after Co functionalization and Pd doping on SBA-15, thus proving that the deposited metals are located inside the channels of SBA-15. Besides, the structure of ordered mesoporous silica SBA-15 was retained throughout the functionalization and doping process, as also corroborated by TEM. The 3D morphology of 3Pd/17CoMagSBA catalyst in Figs. 4 and 5 , show the formation of parallel Co nanowire in the pore channels (bright elongated structures followed the direction of channels) of SBA-15, along with Pd nanoparticles on the outer side. The elemental mapping in Fig. 5(a, b) show both particulate and linear structure of Co nanoparticles (17 wt.%). These results indicate that by using simple ball-mill method, the Co precursor Co(NO3)2·6H2O can be introduced into the channels of SBA-15. Thereafter, the calcination process induces the formation of Co nanowires along the mesoporous channels of SBA-15, while some Co aggregate outside the pores and form large nanoparticles. Fig. 5(c, d) confirm the successful doping of Pd on the CoMagSBA and their uniform dispersion as Pd nanoparticles."
8,Catalytic evaluation of selective oxidation of BzOH-to-BzH,"3.2 Catalytic evaluation of selective oxidation of BzOH-to-BzH It can be seen from Table 1 , that CoMagSBA as a catalyst for selective oxidation of BzOH-to-BzH, did not produce any significant yield, confirming that it has no catalytic effect up on the reaction. On the other hand, 4Pd/SBA showed 30 % yield proving the catalytic effect of Pd on the conversion of BzOH-to-BzH. Finally, the 4Pd/17CoMagSBA exhibited an 18 % enhancement in yield and 3% improvement in selectivity than Pd/SBA. This high catalytic effect of 4Pd/17CoMagSBA can be attributed to the promotional activity of Co on Pd under the selected milder condition (compared to the performance in the literature) [44]. Further, Co could suppress the formation and irreversible absorption of by-product [45], thereby improving the selectivity to BzH. However, 3Pd/20CoMagSBA reduced the selectivity, due to the inhibitory effect of excess Co. To further investigate the promotional effect of cobalt, transition metals such as Mn, Cu, and Zn were doped on CoMagSBA and used as catalysts. Table 2 and Fig. 6 show the comparative catalytic performance of 3Pd/20CoMagSBA, 3Pd/20MnSBA, 3Pd/20CuSBA, and 3Pd/20ZnSBA. Co- and Mn doped CoMagSBA exhibited fair and close conversions and selectivity. 3Pd/20ZnSBA was the best among them, on the contrary 3Pd/20CuSBA was significantly below. To understand the reason, the electron configurations of these transition metals should be considered. The electron configurations of Cu and Zn are: Cu ([Ar]3d104 s1) and Zn ([Ar]3d104 s2). Both have 10 electrons in the 3d orbitals, but in the 4 s orbital Zn has 2 electrons while Cu has 1 electron. Hence, it can be fairly presumed that the number of electrons in the 4 s orbitals influence the promotional effect. Then the electron configuration of Co, Mn and Zn were all compared. Their configurations are: Mn ([Ar]3d54 s2), Co ([Ar]3d74 s2), and Zn ([Ar]3d104 s2). These three elements have 2 electrons on 4 s orbital and can produce catalysts. It was then concluded that the promotional effect of cobalt was from its chemical property that was related to the number of electrons on the 4 s orbitals. Since cobalt could have a better promotional effect and selectivity towards the reaction as well as improve the magnetic separability, therefore cobalt was selected as the best-suited metal in this study. Figs. 7 and 8 show that the performance of the catalysts with 12 wt.% Co loading (3Pd/12CoMagSBA) have a lower performance than 17 wt.% Co loading(3Pd/17CoMagSBA). However, increasing the Co loading, did not have any significant improvement of the reaction performance. Hence 17 wt.% was chosen as the optimized quantity for Co loading. Figs. 9 and 10 show that the conversion rate of reaction increased with Pd loading from 2 wt.% to 4 wt.%. Since 4 wt.% Pd loading (4Pd/17CoMagSBA) gave a high reaction performance as well as ensures uniform dispersion of Pd nanoparticles, it was selected for further study."
9,Catalyst recycling test,"3.3 Catalyst recycling test The stability of catalysts is a crucial issue for the conversion of BzOH to BzH in this three-phase system with O2 gas as the oxidant. The possibilities of leaching of active sites into the liquid mixture or to be oxidized by O2 gas and change their chemical states, often lead to catalyst deactivation or in worst case forming another homogenous catalysis process. However, as seen in Fig. 11 , the 4Pd/17CoMagSBA exhibited high stability till at least 5 reaction runs. It is to be noted that the catalysts could be recovered by facile magnetic separation and did not require any regeneration before using them for subsequent reaction runs (Fig. 12 )."
10,CO2-TPD-MS measurement,"3.4 CO2-TPD-MS measurement CO2-TPD-MS measurement is the equipment to measure the basicity of the solid. CO2 is an acidic gas, which can be applied as the probe gas for basicity adsorption. When there are weak basic sites, the interaction between CO2 and these sites will be weak, so the chemically adsorbed CO2 will desorb at a lower temperature during the temperature programming; Similarly, if there are strong basic sites, the chemisorbed CO2 will have desorption at high temperature during the temperature programming. In the catalytic system in this study, it was found that the BzOH could be converted to BzH without external alkalis. It was assumed that the catalysts are inherently basic that eliminated the use of external alkalis. The prominent peaks in CO2-TPD-MS of the catalysts prove the same."
11,Mechanism,"3.5 Mechanism Previous literatures propose that the selective oxidation of BzOH to BzH requires a basic environment, such as addition of NaOH, to stimulate the oxidation activity of the catalysts as well as improve the selectivity towards BzH [44,46–51]. Further investigations concluded that an optimized basicity for BzOH to BzH is ∼ 9.2. Increasing the basicity to ∼ 9.5 results in formation of benzoic acid [52]. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain an optimized basicity to obtain the highest selectivity. Mori et al., reported that the reaction occurs by coordination of the OH group of BzOH with the unsaturated Pd species and forms a Pd-alcoholate species, which subsequently undergoes a hydride elimination, producing BzH and a Pd-hydride species [53]. The Pd-hydride species react with O2, thereby regenerating the Pd species, and the forming O2 and H2O. Further investigations concurred the same. Prati et al., also proposed that on noble metal surfaces, benzyl alcohol could dissociate homolytically by surface-oxygen assistance to produce an alkoxy intermediate Ph−CH2-O* on the Pd surface. Once alkoxy Ph−CH2-O* is formed, H of Ph−CH2-O* would be abstracted by empty Pd sites to form benzaldehyde Ph−CHO, these sites were required for the benzaldehyde formation [54–61]. In this study, the catalysts were acid/base bi-functional heterogeneous catalysts: Pd nanoparticles and the O2− of CoO were the Lewis base sites, while the Co2+ acted as the Lewis acid sites. During the reaction, the E1cB elimination process started first: the OH bond of benzyl alcohol was cleaved by free coordinative Pd sites. The benzyl alcohol would become alkoxide first, this alkoxide was the conjugate base of benzyl alcohol; Pd would further undergo β-H elimination to cleave the β-C-H bond of the alkoxide and produce benzaldehyde. After these two steps, Pd would become Pd-hydride. The O2- of CoO helped to abstract the protons H from Pd-hydride and form H2O, and finally the Co2+ ions reacted with molecular oxygen to regain their CoO form. Thereafter, the free coordinative Pd catalytic sites could be recovered, completing the catalysis circle. The proposed mechanism is shown in Fig. 13 . It is inferred from the similar XRD patters of 4Pd/17CoMagSBA (Fig. S2), that the CoO did not change its chemical state, implying that CoO was not oxidized by O2 and remained in Co2+ state. This reconfirms the proposed mechanism that O2- of CoO acted as basic sites and extracted H from Pd-hydride [52,53,55]."
12,Conclusions,"The following were concluded from this study: 1) The use of SBA as mesoporous supports in the Pd/CoMagSBA catalysts enhanced their catalytic surface area. The facile solvent-less ball-milling technique followed by H2 reduction resulted in the formation of CoO nanoparticles inside the channels of SBA-15, along with loaded Pd nanoparticles. 2) For the BzOh to BzH solvent-less reaction, the catalyst 4Pd/17CoMagSBA with 4 wt.% of Pd and 17 wt.% of cobalt in SBA-15 proved the best. A yield of 48.1 % and selectivity of 83.2 % was achieved, which is comparable to other literature-based catalytic reactions conducted at temperature >100 °C (Table S1). Various characterizations proved that Pd nanoparticles acted as the basic active sites for the catalysis while Co nanoparticles provided the promotional effect. Excess of Pd lead to larger particle sizes but too low Pd content could not provide sufficient active sites. As for Co, high content of it could depress the reaction, while the low content could not promote the catalysis sufficiently. The proposed mechanism was able to explain the catalytic process via E1cB elimination mechanism, in which Pd and O2− were the basic sites to abstract H, and Co2+ was the acidic sites. During the reaction, the OH bond on BzOH could be cleaved by Pd and be converted to alkoxide. The alkoxide was the conjugate base of the BzOH, it would be converted to BzH by Pd in the way that Pd further cleaved the β-C-H bond. Pd would become Pd-hydride after these two steps, then CoO could recover Pd-hydride to free coordinative Pd sites. 3) The Co content of the catalysts enabled them to be recycled by magnetic separation and reused without any regeneration. The catalyst maintained its activity even after 5 reaction runs, thus proving their high stability for long-term usage."
