0,Introduction,"Flavonoids are a large subclass of natural polyphenols widely distributed in plants. They are accumulated in almost all plant organs. Some are responsible for colours of fruit (mainly in the skin), veins of leaves, petals of flowers [1,2]. Numerous flavonoids were extensively studied for their various biological activities and beneficial effects on human health. Flavonoids such as quercetin (3,3′,4′,5,7-pentahydroxyflavone) and its glycoside, rutin are potent antioxidants [3]. Quercetin was often chosen as an active main because it is considered the most powerful antioxidant, and the most widely distributed in nature [4]. Moreover, it has already been used for its anti-inflammatory and anti-tumour activities as well as for cellular protective properties in brain, liver, kidney and colon diseases [5–7]. However, in spite of exhibiting a wide range of pharmacological properties, quercetin and other flavonoids present two obstacles for their pharmaceutical use. The first problem is poor solubility in aqueous media [8] and the second is the sensitivity of flavonoids to oxidative degradation, resulting in poor stability in the aqueous aerobic environment [9]. Lauro et al. found the quercetin solubility at room temperature to be cq = 7.7 mg/L [10]. The poor solubility can be increased by organic solvents [11,12], ionic liquids [13], supercritical water [14] or supercritical carbon dioxide in combination with ethanol [15]. Ethanol is one of the best solvents for quercetin however, the stability of quercetin in ethanol and in water at higher temperatures is limited [16,17]. For rutin isolation the methanol, methanol/water and buffered methanol/water mixtures are the most frequently employed extractants [18]. However, to determine proper solvents and to design an optimized production process, the interactions between a given flavonoid and solvent at the bulk phase and at different interfaces should be known. The solvents affect greatly the molecular properties such as bond length, polarizability, electron distribution, dipole moments, relative stabilities of different conformers and spectroscopic parameters. The short chain alcohols, that is methanol, ethanol and propanol, used not only as solvents, but also co-solvents or co-surfactants have always been considered as interesting due to their anomalous behaviour which depends mainly on the solution microstructure [19–24]. This microstructure of the bulk phase of aqueous solutions of alcohols is governed by the hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions and hydration which are reflected in the enthalpy and entropy contributions to the free enthalpy of solutions [24,25]. In the literature it can be found that alcohol self-association takes place in the aqueous solution and that the structure of aqueous solutions of short chain alcohols is characterized by individual alcohol aggregates and water clusters without a significant amount of alcohol–water mixed aggregates [26,27] or in contrast that ethanol and 1-propanol form strong hydrogen bonds with water and exist as inhibitors in clathrate hydrate formation [28]. Independently of the opinions about the structure of the aqueous solutions of short chain alcohols, it is known that their structure would influence the intramolecular or intermolecular interactions with different molecules [29,30], including flavonoids thereby the anti-oxidative effects of the flavonoids molecule. Thus the purpose of the presented studies was to determine the thermodynamic parameters of adsorption at the water-air interface that is the standard Gibbs free energy ( Δ G ads 0 ) , enthalpy ( Δ H ads 0 ) and entropy ( Δ S ads 0 ) of adsorption as well as the infinite dilution activity coefficient ( γ ∞ ) of water-alcohol solutions of quercetin and rutin. For this purpose the surface tension of water-methanol (MeOH), water-ethanol (EtOH) and water-1-propanol (PrOH) solutions of quercetin and rutin (C = 4 × 10−5 and 10−4 M) in the wide range of alcohol concentration (Cp = 0–80%) was measured at T = 293, 303 and 313 K."
1,Experimental,"Quercetin (Q) (Sigma-Aldrich), rutin (Ru) (Sigma-Aldrich), methanol (MeOH) (PoCh), ethanol (EtOH) (PoCh) and 1-propanol (PrOH) (PoCh) were used without further purification. The aqueous solutions of quercetin and rutin with alcohols were prepared using doubly distilled and deionized water (Destamat Bi18E). The surface tension of water was always checked before the solution preparation. The equilibrium surface tension of water-alcohol solutions of quercetin and rutin was measured at 293, 303 and 313 K by a Krüss K9 tensiometer according to the platinum ring tensiometer method (du Nouy’s method). The measured surface tension values were corrected according to the procedure of Harkins and Jordan [31]. The ring was cleaned with distilled water and heated to red colour with a Bunsen burner before each measurement. In all cases more than 10 successive measurements were made. The standard deviation depending on the surfactant concentration range was from ±0.1 to ±0.2 mN/m. The temperature was controlled by a jacketed vessel joined to the thermostatic water bath with the accuracy ±0.01 K."
2,Results and discussion,"The measured values of the surface tension ( γ LV ) of water-alcohol solutions of quercetin and rutin at the different temperatures are presented in Figs. 1–6 together with the literature data values of surface tension of water-alcohol solutions ( γ LV a ) at 293 K [24] (Figs. 1, 3 and 5) for comparison. From these figures it results that the surface tension of the studied alcohol-quercetin/rutin solutions decreases with the alcohol concentration which extends with the length of the hydrocarbon chain of alcohol. This reduction of surface tension of water-flavonoid solutions is predominantly related to the water-water H-bonds reduction, which is caused by the presence of alcohol molecules [19,23] and for the mixtures of ethanol and 1-propanol with flavonoids it is the largest in the low concentration range, < 20% which is consistent with the changes of the surface energy values calculated by Phan et al. [23]. From the comparison of the literature data of the surface tension of water-alcohol mixtures at T = 293 K ( γ LV a ) [24] with those with quercetin and rutin at different concentrations (Figs. 1, 3 and 5) it results that the latter are higher than the first ones. Also if these values are compared for Cp = 40%, it results that the addition of quercetin and rutin has the slightlest influence on the values of γ LV of PrOH solutions that is the difference between γ LV a and γ LV is equal to 0.51 (C Q = 4 × 10−5 M), 0.98 (C Q = 10−4 M), 0.31 (C Ru = 4 × 10−5 M) and 0.76 (C Q = 10−4 M), in contrast to methanol where the values of γ LV a - γ LV are the greatest and equal to 3.96, 4.68, 4.43 and 7.00 mN/m, respectively. To explain this fact taking into account the measured values of γ LV the standard free enthalpy of adsorption of a given alcohol in flavonoid solutions at the water-air interface ( Δ G ads 0 ) , that is the measure of the efficiency of alcohol to adsorb at this interface was calculated. In the literature there are many equations which can be used to evaluate the Δ G ads 0 of surface active agents (surfactants) and alcohols at the water-air interface [32–34]. Taking into account the Rosen and Aronson equation [33], Gamboa and Olea [35] derived the equation from which it is possible to determine the standard Gibbs free energy of surfactant adsorption by using its concentration at which the surface tension of water is reduced by 20 mN/m: (1) Δ G ads o = RT ( pC 20 + K 1 ) where pC 20 is the negative logarithm of C at π = 20 mN / m , π – the surface pressure that is the difference between the surface tension of solution and solvent, K 1 – the constant, T – the temperature, R – the gas constant. Zdziennicka and Jańczuk [36], contrary to Gamboa and Olea [35], proved that for alcohols K 1 is not equal to 1.3 but 2.16, 2.17 and 2.18 for MeOH, EtOH and PrOH, respectively. Taking into account different values of K 1 for the mentioned alcohols the values of Δ G ads 0 for the studied solutions were calculated in two different ways that is for π = γ LV ( water ) - γ LV ( solution ) and π = γ LV ( water + Q / Ru ) - γ LV ( solution ) , and are presented in Tables 1–3 . As for the solutions with PrOH the addition of the smallest value of alcohol (5%) gives the values of γ LV smaller than those which can be used for Δ G ads 0 calculation on the basis of pC 20, the values of Δ G ads 0 for all studied systems were calculated from pC 30 [37] and are also presented in Tables 1–3. As follows from the tables all the values of Δ G ads 0 are negative and for a given flavonoid concentration decreases with the increasing T. Also the smallest values of Δ G ads 0 are observed for 1-propanol. In the case of MeOH (Table 1) the values of Δ G ads 0 for rutin calculated from pC 20 and pC 30 toward water are higher than the appropriate value of Δ G ads 0 for quercetin. From the comparison of the values of Δ G ads 0 ( Q / Ru , 20 ) and Δ G ads 0 ( Q / Ru , 30 ) for methanol, it results that for rutin at C = 10−4 M also the values of Δ G ads 0 are higher than those for quercetin but only at T = 293 K. In the case of ethanol (Table 2) its efficiency to adsorb at the water-air interface is higher for the rutin solution at C = 4 × 10−5 M because all the values Δ G ads 0 calculated for this concentration are smaller than those for quercetin. For rutin at C = 10−4 M the values of Δ G ads 0 ( W , 20 ) and Δ G ads 0 ( W , 30 ) at a given temperature are higher than those for quercetin, in contrast to those of Δ G ads 0 ( Q / Ru , 20 ) and Δ G ads 0 (Table 2). In the case of PrOH (Table 3) the values of Δ G ads 0 ( W , 30 ) for rutin are higher than those for quercetin but only at T = 293 K. It is interesting that at T = 293 K all the values of Δ G ads 0 ( W , 20 ) for quercetin and rutin solutions with MeOH are smaller than those taken from the literature data for methanol-water ones [24] but the opposite situation is observed in the case of EtOH. From the obtained values of Δ G ads 0 at different temperatures, the change in the standard entropy of alcohol adsorption, Δ S ads 0 , can be obtained from the relation [32,34]: (2) Δ S ads 0 = - ∂ ( Δ G ads 0 ) / ∂ T and the change in the standard enthalpy of adsorption, Δ H ads 0 , can be calculated on the basis of the thermodynamic relation: (3) Δ H ads 0 = Δ G ads 0 + T Δ S ads 0 The resulting values of Δ S ads 0 and Δ H ads 0 for the studied solutions are presented in Tables 4 and 5 , respectively. The positive values of Δ S ads 0 indicate that all studied systems becomes more random that is less structured after adsorption [32]. The values of Δ H ads 0 for all solutions calculated on the basis of Δ G ads 0 ( W , 20 ) and Δ G ads 0 ( W , 30 ) (Table 5) are negative and indicate that bond making predominates in the adsorption process. It is interesting that the values of Δ H ads 0 calculated from Δ G ads 0 ( Q / Ru , 20 ) and Δ G ads 0 are positive and negative. This points out that the changing concentration of quercetin and rutin influences greatly the adsorption process of the studied alcohols. Taking into account the measured values of surface tension of the studied alcohols with quercetin and rutin it is possible to calculate the infinite dilution activity coefficient ( γ ∞ ) of the alcohols using the method proposed by Gracia-Fadrique et al. [38–40] for the surface active agents. This method combines the first natural nonideal surface equation of state of the Van der Waals type, the Volmer equation ( π ( A - A 0 ) = RT ) , and the Gibbs adsorption equation and is based on the application of equilibrium conditions between the bulk and surface phases. The main equation of the model can be written as: (4) ln π ∗ x = π m A 0 RT ( 1 - π ∗ ) + ln γ LV ∞ where π ∗ = π / π m is the reduced surface pressure, π = γ LV 0 - γ LV is the surface pressure, π m is the maximum surface pressure, and A 0 is the constant of the Van der Waals type. The γ LV ∞ parameter can be obtained from the linear fit of Eq. (4) to the high quality experimental data. The values of γ ∞ calculated in two ways, similarly to the values of Δ G ads 0 , Δ S ads 0 and Δ H ads 0 are presented in Tables 6 and 7 . As follows from the tables all the values of γ ∞ increase with T and for MeOH, those calculated for π = γ LV ( water + Q / Ru ) - γ LV ( solution ) for a given flavonoid concentration and T are greater than those calculated for π = γ LV ( water ) - γ LV ( solution ) . It is interesting that for PrOH all the γ ∞ values are larger than 1 which, according to the Motomura’s model [41], indicates that the interactions between the molecules of flavonoids and solvents, that is water and alcohols in the studied mixtures are considerably larger than those between the single molecules. Also for PrOH the values of γ ∞ for quercetin are higher than those for rutin which means that in practical applications the mixture of quercetin and propanol at small concentrations should possess the best surface active properties. This is also true for higher PrOH concentrations and T = 293 K because at this temperature the values of Δ G ads 0 for quercetin are smaller than for rutin (Table 1). On the other hand, taking into account the values of standard Gibbs free energy of adsorption and infinite dilution activity coefficient for rutin and alcohols it results that the mixtures of rutin with ethanol exhibit the best surface active properties."
3,Conclusions,"In the paper some thermodynamic parameters of adsorption at the water-air interface of short chain alcohols, methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol in aqueous solutions of two flavonoids, quercetin (3,3′,4′,5,7-pentahydroxyflavone), and its glycoside, rutin are singled out, discussed, and compared on the basis of surface tension measurements. From the presented data and calculations, it is evident that all studied systems become more random after adsorption as well as bond making predominates in the adsorption process if only water is taken as a solvent. Also under the studied conditions the mixtures of rutin with ethanol solutions and quercetin with methanol show the best adsorption properties which can be of significant use in practical applications."
