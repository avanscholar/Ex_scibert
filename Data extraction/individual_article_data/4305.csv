0,Introduction,"Fossil fuels consumption has increased rapidly in the last decades. Meanwhile, conventional energy supply has caused many terrible environmental problems, such as global warming, air pollution, and water pollution. Thus, developing clean and reliable sources is looked at in high interesting. With several advantages like high calorific value, light weight, non-toxicity, and no pollution emissions, hydrogen has gradually become a substitute for fossil fuels [1,2]. Hydrogen is also a good candidate for the fuel cell, however, on-board hydrogen production is more realistic considering its low bulk density [3,4]. Therefore, this work aims to provide a reactor for on-board hydrogen production. Several methods for hydrogen production have been developed which can be categorized into catalytic, electrolytic, pyrolytic and plasma. Catalytic reforming [5–7] and water electrolysis [8,9] have been applied in industrial application, but the energy consumption of these two methods are relatively high which are over 2kWh/m3, 4.2kWh/m3 respectively. In addition, catalytic reforming usually needs high temperature, high pressure and catalysts. Pyrolysis of biomass [10–12] for hydrogen production has not been widely used because of low flow rate of hydrogen and strict requirements of devices. Considering these problems, plasma reforming for hydrogen production has been increasingly studied these years. Unlike other methods, plasma reforming [13–38] needs no catalysts and can be easily formed in room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Currently the vast majority of plasma reforming for hydrogen production are generated in gas, while discharging in liquid for hydrogen production has been scarcely reported [15–18]. Discharging in gas has many shortcomings [19] like shortening the service life of the electrodes due to its high temperature, weakening the strength of discharge owing to the coke attached to the electrodes and so on, but these problems can be solved through discharging in liquid due to the cooling and buoyancy of the liquid. Pulsed high voltage discharge in liquid has been applied in sewage treatment, material modification and so on. However, until now, there have been a rare number of reports about its application in hydrogen production. Pulsed high voltage discharge in liquid combines the advantages of both pulsed discharge and discharging in liquid. Pulsed discharge can generate higher peak current density, generation efficiency of electrons and radicals; meanwhile, it is easy to produce a large area of non-equilibrium plasma [20–22], while discharging in liquid can produce higher plasma density and larger spatial distribution [23,24]. Owing to these advantages, raw materials can be adequately broken down and hydrogen production can be effectively enhanced. There are many discharge types in pulsed high voltage discharge in liquid, such as corona discharge, spark discharge, and arc discharge. Among them, spark discharge has its unique advantages. Compared with corona discharge, spark discharge has longer discharge channels and higher partial discharge intensity; and by contrast with arc discharge, it can reduce energy consumption. What is more, some reports have found that spark discharge can improve energy efficiency and resist to carbon deposition in discharging in liquid [25,26]. Therefore, hydrogen production by pulsed high voltage spark discharge in liquid is a promising item. The raw materials for hydrogen production come from hydrogen-containing substances. In the existing documents, hydrocarbons [27,28], alcohols [29–34], dimethyl ether [35,36] are widely used. However, some shortcomings of these common raw materials cannot be ignored. First, despite of its high hydrogen content, methanol is rather toxic and dangerous for experimental operation. As for other high carbon-containing alcohols (such as butanol), they are relatively expensive and difficult to acquire; meanwhile by-products such as CO, CO2, and CH4 may be promoted, which can reduce the hydrogen purity during hydrogen production. Hydrocarbons are another familiar raw materials for hydrogen production, but many restrictions like narrower flammability limits, lower compression ratio and less environment-friendliness cannot be overcome [1]. As we all know that dimethyl ether is a flammable gas, so it cannot be the suitable material for discharging in liquid. Consequently, compared with all the materials mentioned above, ethanol is the most appropriate one. Ethanol is colorless, transparent and non-toxic at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, which can be generated from biological fermentation and residues decomposition. It is eco-friendly and fit to discharge in liquid for hydrogen production. In addition, there are only two carbon atoms in ethanol molecule, which can limit the formation of by-products and improve the purity of hydrogen. In a word, as a renewable resource, ethanol is an ideal raw material for hydrogen production. In this work, hydrogen production by pulsed high voltage spark discharge in ethanol solution was firstly investigated at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. A reactor for on-board hydrogen production was designed and the related parameters for hydrogen production were optimized as well. At last, the comparison between this method and other methods of hydrogen production was emphasized. It is the first time that pulsed high voltage spark discharge in liquid has been used for hydrogen production in the existing documents. All of this work paves the way for intensive study in the future."
1,Experimental setup and methods,"Fig. 1 shows the schematic of experimental setup for pulsed discharge in ethanol solution for on-board hydrogen production. The structure of the spark discharge reactor in the experiments was the needle–plate electrode configurations. The needle electrode was made of platinum and shaped to have a sharp tip with a radius of curvature of approximately 0.2mm at the end with high positive potential, while the ground plate electrode was made of stainless steel and its diameter was about 80mm. The plasma reactor was powered by a high voltage power supply (DGM-60, DaLian Power Supply Technology) equipped with a maximum allowable voltage of 60kV and frequency of 300Hz. An oscilloscope (TDS2024B, Tektronix) with a high voltage probe (P6015A, Tektronix) and a current probe (2878, Pearson Electronics) was used to analyze the variation of voltage and current in the discharge circuit. In order to prevent the liquid level dropping in discharge process, peristaltic pump and filling tank were used as a circulatory system to supply ethanol solution. A buffer was used to stabilize the produced gas and a rotor flow meter (LZB-3, ZhengXing) was used to measure the flow rate of gas production. The mass spectrometry (HALO201, Hiden) and gas chromatography (GC-2014C, SHIMADZU) were used to make qualitative and quantitative analysis of gas production. Before the experiments, the level of ethanol solution must have flown over the needle electrode and it was ensured that both of the needle and plate electrodes were sunken in the solution. The whole chamber was about 400cm3 and a window was designed in the container wall, which was used to monitor the process of discharge. In the experiments, when the pulsed spark discharge was formed, various active substances such as high-energy electrons, strong oxydic free radicals and excited molecules came into being in the discharge region and reacted with ethanol solution. Many chemical bonds in ethanol and water were dissociated and then some of the products were reunited, forming a variety of products including H2, CO, C2H2, CO2, which were detected by MS shown in Fig. 2 . The typical current–voltage oscillogram of single pulsed spark discharge in ethanol solution was presented in Fig. 3 . The spark discharge was formed as the current increased rapidly while the voltage decreased sharply. In the experiments, air rotor flow meter was used to measure the flow rate of total gas production. The flow rate of hydrogen can be obtained by hydrogen selectivity. (1) Q H 2 = ω H 2 Q flowmeter reading 29 ∑ ω a M a where ωa refers to the proportion of ‘a’ in the gas production and Ma refers to the molar mass of ‘a’. The selectivity of the main gases in the total gas production can be calculated through the volume of gas by followings. (2) H 2 selectivity = V H 2 V total gas (3) CO selectivity = V CO V total gas (4) Other gas selectivity = V total gas - V CO - V H 2 V total gas In addition, the energy of single pulsed discharge inputted in the reactor can be calculated through V–I by formula (5) and the heat of ethanol solution can be estimated by formula (6). (5) W = ∫ v ( t ) i ( t ) dt where v(t), i(t) refer to voltage and current respectively, both of them are in the function of time acquired by oscilloscope. (6) Q = cm Δ t where c refers to the specific heat capacity of ethanol solution, m refers to the weight of ethanol solution, and Δt refers to the temperature variation. In this work, every experiment was repeated 5 times. The errors mainly came from instantaneous instability of discharge. In addition, numerical reading and changing external environment may have also led to errors."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Influence of peak voltage on hydrogen production,"3.1 Influence of peak voltage on hydrogen production Influence of peak voltage on hydrogen production was investigated by varying voltage from 24kV to 32kV. The operational conditions were discharge frequency=30Hz, initial ethanol concentration=50%, electrode distance=15mm. The flow rate of gas as a function of peak voltage is presented in Fig. 4 . It is observed that both of the curves of total gas and hydrogen have similar variations, which are almost exponential growth with the increased peak voltage. Fig. 5 shows the different gas selectivity as a function of peak voltage. As the figure shows, the selectivity of hydrogen and carbon monoxide show a linear increase and the selectivity of hydrogen is about twice as carbon monoxide. However, the selectivity of other gas declines sharply, which is far less than that of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. When the peak voltage increases to 32kV, the selectivity of other gas is only about 1%. As the peak voltage increases, the energy applied in the reactor also increases. Meanwhile more and more high-energy electrons and active particles are applied to the reaction, which leads to more decomposition and formation. Both the flow rates of total gas and hydrogen rise rapidly with the increased peak voltage. In addition, more chemical bonds are broken down with the increase of peak voltage, which can hardly be decomposed with low energy such as H–O in water. It would result in more radical reaction thus increasing the selectivity of hydrogen."
4,Influence of electrode distance on hydrogen production,"3.2 Influence of electrode distance on hydrogen production In order to optimize the reactor for hydrogen production, influence of electrode distance on hydrogen production was also tested. In this work, electrode distance varies from 5 to 20mm, while the peak voltage, discharge frequency and initial ethanol concentration were kept at 30kV, 30Hz and 50% respectively. Flow rate of gas as a function of electrode distance is presented in Fig. 6 . Both of two curves show a rapid rise at first until reaching the maximum values and then decline. The maximum values appear when the electrode distance is about 15mm, the flow rate of hydrogen can reach 422mL/min under this condition. Gas selectivity as a function of electrode distance is shown in Fig. 7 . It is found that the selectivity of hydrogen and carbon monoxide initially increase, and then decrease after the electrode distance exceeds 15mm. However, the selectivity of other gas is contrary to hydrogen and carbon monoxide. As shown in Fig. 7, the selectivity of hydrogen can reach 65.6%, it is about twice that of carbon monoxide and 17 times that of other gas. The reason why these phenomena appear is related to the space that active substance from plasma works with the ethanol molecules (or water molecules). When the electrode distance is short, the space is limited, so the high-energy electrons and active particles cannot be fully used in the reaction. Lots of energy and active particles are wasted so that hydrogen production decreases. By contrast, if the distance is too long, it is difficult to stimulate the spark discharge; even if the spark discharge is stimulated, the high-energy electrons are less due to the reduced electric field that many chemical bonds cannot be broken [37,38]. Eventually, the hydrogen production decreases greatly. Therefore, a suitable electrode distance is critical. As shown in Figs. 6 and 7, the best electrode distance is about 14–15mm."
5,Influence of electric field on hydrogen production,"3.3 Influence of electric field on hydrogen production The effects of peak voltage and electrode distance were investigated in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 respectively. As shown in Section 3.1, hydrogen production was enhanced with the increase of the electric field intensity varied by peak voltage. However, it was not consistent with Section 3.2 in how the electric field intensity was changed by electrode distance. Thus, it is essential to analyze the influence of average electric field on hydrogen production. The average intensity of electric field is estimated by formula (7) as below: (7) E = U d where E refers to the average intensity of electric field, U refers to the peak voltage and d refers to the electrode distance. Table 1 shows the status of hydrogen production at the same average intensity of electric field. Both the peak voltage and electrode distance are changed, whereas the average intensity of the electric field is kept at 2×106 V/m. As shown by the table, the statuses of hydrogen production are not the same at the same average intensity of electric field. However, hydrogen production is enhanced with the suitable input power and reaction space. Consequently, there is no necessary correlation between hydrogen production and electric field intensity and both of the peak voltage and electrode distance are important."
6,Influence of discharge frequency on hydrogen production,"3.4 Influence of discharge frequency on hydrogen production Further studies were performed at peak voltage=30kV, electrode distance=15mm and initial ethanol concentration=50% with discharge frequency ranging from 5 to 40Hz. The flow rate of gas as a function of discharge frequency is shown in Fig. 8 . With the increase of discharge frequency, either the flow rate of total gas or hydrogen increases sharply at first, but increases slower than before when the applied discharge frequency is over 30Hz. The gas selectivity as a function of discharge frequency is shown in Fig. 9 . As the discharge frequency increased, the selectivity of hydrogen and carbon monoxide grow but the trends increasingly slow. In contrast, the selectivity of other gas decreases, which drops to 1.1% at the frequency of 40Hz. As the discharge frequency increases, the chance that active substances from plasma colliding with ethanol molecules (or water molecules) also increases in unit time. It means there are more active substances applied to reaction in the same period, which can lead to more molecules decomposed. With the increase of discharge frequency, the flow rate and the selectivity of hydrogen both rise. However, as the discharge frequency increased to a certain extent, the collisions between the active substance and molecules reach saturation. So the hydrogen production will not continue to increase. Temperature as a function of discharge frequency is presented in Fig. 10 . The operational conditions were peak voltage=30kV, initial ethanol concentration=50%, electrode distance=15mm, discharge time=2min. The temperature of ethanol solution was measured after discharging 5min. With the increase of discharge frequency, the temperature of ethanol solution exponentially increases. It means that more electric energy may be changed to heat. Table 2 shows the thermal statuses of different discharge frequency by discharging 5min. With the increase of the discharge frequency, the heat of ethanol solution rises, which contains the conversion of electric energy and exotherm from the reaction. However, it is difficult to identify the contribution of these two calorie sources due to complicated reaction process. In contrast, the growth rate of hydrogen yield is slowed down after 30Hz as shown in Figs. 8 and 9. Thus, the increase of thermal cannot promote hydrogen production. This is another reason why low-frequency pulsed spark discharge in ethanol solution for hydrogen production is more practicable which can also reduce the energy consumption."
7,Influence of initial ethanol concentration on hydrogen production,"3.5 Influence of initial ethanol concentration on hydrogen production The initial ethanol concentration was varied from 0% to 99.8%, which covers the whole concentration range and the peak voltage, discharge frequency, electrode distance were kept at 30kV, 30Hz and 15mm respectively. Flow rate of gas as a function of initial ethanol concentration is presented in Fig. 11 . As shown in this figure, the flow rate of total gas increases rapidly at first and decreases gradually when the initial ethanol concentration is over 50%. The flow rate of hydrogen has a similar tendency before the initial ethanol concentration exceeds 50% but it stays essentially constant when the ethanol concentration is over 50%. Fig. 12 shows the gas selectivity as a function of initial ethanol concentration. With the increase of initial ethanol concentration, the selectivity of hydrogen increases constantly while other gas does just the opposite. The selectivity of carbon monoxide increases before the ethanol concentration reaches 50%, and then decreases along with the continuous growth of initial ethanol concentration. The selectivity of hydrogen reaches 73.9% when the initial ethanol concentration is about 99.8%. According to the experimental data, it can be confirmed that water is involved in the reaction. When initial ethanol concentration is less than 50%, the ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide is about 2:1. The selectivity of hydrogen and carbon monoxide are 65.6%, 30.7% respectively when the initial ethanol concentration is 45%. So the main reaction may be as below: (8) C 2 H 5 OH + H 2 O → 4 H 2 + 2 CO Δ H = 256 kJ / mol However, when initial ethanol concentration is more than 50%, the ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide is rapidly increased. The selectivity of hydrogen and carbon monoxide are 73.9%, 23.6% respectively when the initial ethanol concentration is 99.8%, which make the ratio reach 3:1. Thus, the main process probably follows this pathway: (9) C 2 H 5 OH → 3H 2 + CO + C Δ H = 71.8 kJ/mol The pathways also appeared in other works [1,19,29–31]. At the same times, from Eqs. (8) and (9), we can find that the amount of total gas is more when water participates in the reaction, which also meets the experimental results. When the spark discharge was applied in 45% ethanol solution for 10min, the ethanol conversion was about 1.98%. The total volume of ethanol solution was about 320mL, so 2.85mL of ethanol was consumed. Meanwhile, the main products were hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which can be calculated by the flow rate and selectivity of gas production. Through the calculation, the results basically met the mass conservation and suit the reaction (8). With the same method, reaction (9) was also appropriate."
8,Analysis of energy consumption,"3.6 Analysis of energy consumption After optimizing the conditions of hydrogen production, the economic benefit of this method should be discussed. The energy consumption of every discharge can be calculated through formula (5) which is mentioned above. Through the calculation, the energy consumption of every discharge is about 1.425J at peak voltage=30kV, discharge frequency=30Hz, electrode distance=15mm, initial ethanol concentration=45%. Meanwhile, the flow rate of hydrogen is about 422mL/min at this condition. Thus, the energy consumption is about 1.69kWh/m3. Other studies about plasma reforming for hydrogen production are presented in Table 3 . By contrast, it is found that both of the flow rate of hydrogen and energy consumption are superior to most other studies, especially compared with spark discharge in gas for hydrogen production. At the same time, discharging in liquid for hydrogen production is also greater than gas in terms of energy consumption. In addition, the selectivity of hydrogen exceeds average level in our wok. It is important to note that although the flow rate of hydrogen in our work is less than microwave discharge in gas, it can be achieved as well when the same amount of energy supplied. The work in this paper is just the start, as some progress will be achieved soon in later studies."
9,Conclusion,"Hydrogen production from ethanol solution by pulsed high voltage spark discharge was investigated in this work. It is the first time that pulsed high voltage spark discharge in ethanol solution has been used for hydrogen production in the existing documents. Meanwhile, a reactor for on-board hydrogen production was also designed, which is small-scale and portable for automobiles. In the experiments, the gaseous products include H2, CO, C2H2, and CO2. By altering several physical parameters such as peak voltage, discharge frequency, electrode distance, and initial ethanol concentration, the improvement of hydrogen production could be achieved with this method. The main conclusions are as bellow: (1) Hydrogen production increases exponentially with peak voltage. (2) Low discharge frequency is better for hydrogen production. (3) A suitable electrode distance is the key for plasma reforming in hydrogen production. (4) Water involved in the reaction can increase gas production, and it can also reduce the consumption of ethanol. (5) There is no necessary correlation between hydrogen production and electric field intensity. So, the best condition in this work is discharge frequency=30Hz, electrode distance=15mm, initial ethanol concentration=50%, and when the peak voltage applied to 30kV, the flow rate and selectivity of hydrogen can reach 422mL/min, 65.6% respectively. In addition, the energy consumption of this method is about 1.69kWh/m3, which is better than most existing method. In general, pulsed high voltage spark discharge in ethanol solution for hydrogen production has great potential to achieve high hydrogen production and low energy consumption. Meanwhile, a small-scale and portable needle–plate reactor for on-board hydrogen production was designed, which is suitable for automobiles. If large-scale hydrogen production is needed, multi-needle plate configuration can be suitable which can increase the contact area of plasma and ethanol solution. However, as it is just the beginning for this work, many problems need to be solved such as how to improve the energy efficiency and what the pathway of hydrogen production is of this work. If the intermediate process can be investigated and clarified, the best method of hydrogen production will be found. In addition, discharging in liquid can generate strong ultraviolet rays, so photocatalysts may have a huge effect on hydrogen production."
