0,Introduction,"Hydrogen has attracted much attention, because it can be used as a clean and alternative fuel for internal combustion-engine and fuel cell without any pollutant emission [1]. Therefore, many studies have been done on hydrogen production by reforming reactions from various hydrocarbons and alcohols [2–14]. Among various reforming technologies, steam reforming of methane has been recognized as the most feasible process for commercial hydrogen production. Liquefied natural gas (LNG), which is abundant and mainly composed of methane, can serve as a promising source for hydrogen production by steam reforming reaction. Sulfur-free nature of LNG also lessens the significant concern about environmental contamination and catalyst poisoning caused by sulfur compounds. LNG pipelines may become more widespread in the near future, which will make LNG well suited as a hydrogen source for residential reformers in fuel cell applications. Various transition metal catalysts have been employed in the steam reforming reactions [3,4,7,9,11]. It has been reported that activity of Group 8–10 transition metal catalysts in the steam reforming reaction decreases in the order of Ru≈Rh>Ni>Ir>Pd≈Pt>Co≈Fe [11,15,16]. Although ruthenium- and rhodium-based catalysts exhibited a superior catalytic performance compared to other transition metal-based catalysts, nickel-based catalysts have been widely used in the commercial steam reforming processes due to their low cost and relatively high intrinsic catalytic activity. However, it has also been reported that the amount of carbon deposited on the surface of transition metal catalysts decreases in the sequence of Ni≪Rh>Ir≈Ru>Pt≈Pd [11,17]. Among various transition metals, nickel-based catalysts exhibit the weakest resistance toward carbon deposition. For this reason, nickel-based catalysts require high reaction temperature and excess amount of steam to prevent carbon deposition on the catalyst surface during the steam reforming reactions [7,18,19]. Undoubtedly, such severe reaction conditions are not favorable for residential and on-board hydrogen production. Therefore, developing an efficient nickel-based catalyst with high activity and long durability is required for hydrogen production by low temperature steam reforming reactions. Many attempts have been made to overcome the deactivation problem of nickel-based catalysts in the steam reforming reactions [3,4,20–24]. In particular, mesoporous Ni–Al2O3 catalysts with high nickel dispersion have attracted much attention in order to reduce the carbon deposition and nickel sintering during the steam reforming reaction [3,23,24]. Various preparation methods, such as sol–gel method [3,25,26], impregnation method [23,24,27], co-precipitation method [28–32], and sequential precipitation method [29,32,33] have been developed for the preparation of mesoporous Ni–Al2O3 catalysts. Among these preparation methods, both co-precipitation method and sequential precipitation method have been considered as conventional techniques for the preparation of mesoporous Ni–Al2O3 catalysts due to their high economic advantage, high reproducibility, and high homogeneity [34,35]. In a previous work, it was revealed that Ni–Al2O3 catalyst prepared by a sequential precipitation method exhibited a better catalytic performance and a stronger coking resistance than that prepared by a co-precipitation method in the steam reforming of LNG [32]. However, the effect of precipitation agent on the physicochemical properties and catalytic activities of Ni–Al2O3 catalysts prepared by a sequential precipitation method has not been systematically investigated yet. It is expected that physicochemical properties and catalytic performances of mesoporous Ni–Al2O3 catalysts in hydrogen production by steam reforming of LNG are strongly influenced by the precipitation agent used in the sequential precipitation process. In this work, a series of mesoporous Ni–Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by a sequential precipitation method using various basic solutions as precipitation agents for use in hydrogen production by steam reforming of LNG. The effect of precipitation agent on the physicochemical properties and catalytic activities of Ni–Al2O3 catalysts in the steam reforming of LNG was investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of mesoporous Ni–Al2O3 catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of mesoporous Ni–Al2O3 catalysts A series of mesoporous Ni–Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by a sequential precipitation method using various basic solutions as precipitation agents, according to the similar method reported in the literatures [29–33]. 5g of aluminum precursor (aluminum nitrate nonahydrate, Sigma–Aldrich) was dissolved in 20ml of distilled water (Solution A), and 0.678g of nickel precursor (nickel nitrate hexahydrate, Sigma–Aldrich) was separately dissolved in 20ml of distilled water (Solution B). Upon adding a basic solution and Solution A into 50ml of distilled water at room temperature, a white precipitate was formed (Solution C). The pH of Solution C was adjusted to 9 by controlling the amount of basic solution. The basic solution and Solution B were then slowly added into Solution C to form a mixed solution. When pH of the mixed solution was kept at 9 for precipitation of nickel precursor, a blue precipitate was formed within a few seconds. After maintaining the resulting product at room temperature for 24h, a solid recovered from the mixed solution by centrifugation was washed with ethanol. The solid product was dried overnight at 100°C, and then it was calcined at 700°C for 5h to yield Ni–Al2O3 catalyst. The Ni–Al2O3 catalysts prepared by a sequential precipitation method were denoted as NiAl–X (X =NH4OH, KOH, NaOH, and Na2CO3), where X represents the basic solution used as a precipitation agent during the sequential precipitation process. For example, NiAl–NH4OH denotes Ni–Al2O3 catalyst prepared by a sequential precipitation method using NH4OH solution as a precipitation agent. Nickel loading was fixed at 20wt% in all the catalysts."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization Chemical compositions of NiAl–X catalysts were determined by ICP-AES (ICPS-1000IV, Shimadzu) analyses. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of NiAl–X catalysts were obtained with an ASAP-2010 (Micromeritics) instrument, and pore size distributions of NiAl–X catalysts were determined by the Barret–Joyner–Hallender (BJH) method applied to the desorption branch of nitrogen isotherms. Crystalline structures of calcined and reduced NiAl–X catalysts were investigated by XRD (D-Max2500-PC, Rigaku) measurements using Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.541Å) operated at 50kV and 100mA. In order to examine the metal–support interaction in the NiAl–X catalysts, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements were carried out in a conventional flow system with a moisture trap connected to a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 1000°C with a ramping rate of 5°C/min. For the TPR measurements, a mixed stream of H2 (2ml/min) and N2 (20ml/min) was used for 0.1g of catalyst sample. Hydrogen chemisorption experiments (BELCAT-B, BEL Japan) were conducted to measure the nickel dispersion and nickel surface area of reduced NiAl–X catalysts. Prior to the chemisorption measurements, 50mg of each catalyst was reduced with a mixed stream of hydrogen (2.5ml/min) and argon (47.5ml/min) at 700°C for 3h, and subsequently, it was purged with pure argon (50ml/min) at 700°C for 15min. The sample was then cooled to 50°C under a flow of argon (50ml/min). The amount of hydrogen uptake was determined by injecting diluted hydrogen (5% hydrogen and 95% argon) periodically into the reduced catalyst using an on-line sampling valve. Nickel dispersion and nickel surface area were calculated by assuming that one hydrogen atom occupies one surface nickel atom and that cross-sectional area of atomic nickel is 6.49×10−2 m2/Ni-atom. The amount of carbon deposited on the used NiAl–X catalysts was determined by CHNS elemental analyses (CHNS 932, Leco)."
4,Steam reforming of LNG,"2.3 Steam reforming of LNG Steam reforming of LNG was carried out in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor at 600°C under atmospheric pressure. Prior to the catalytic reaction, each catalyst (100mg) was reduced with a mixed stream of H2 (3ml/min) and N2 (30ml/min) at 700°C for 3h. Feed composition was fixed at CH4:C2H6:H2O:N2 =4.6:0.4:10:30, and total feed rate with respect to catalyst weight was maintained at 27,000ml/hg. Reaction products were periodically sampled and analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (ACME 6000, Younglin) equipped with a TCD. LNG conversion was calculated by equation (1) on the basis of carbon balance. Hydrogen composition in dry gas was obtained according to equation (2). (1) LNG conversion ( % ) = ( 1 − F CH 4 , out + F C 2 H 6 , out F CH 4 , in + F C 2 H 6 , in ) × 100 (2) Hydrogen composition in dry gas ( % ) = F H 2 , out F H 2 , out + F CH 4 , out + F C 2 H 6 , out + F CO , out + F CO 2 , out × 100"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Physical and chemical properties of Ni–Al2O3 catalysts,"3.1 Physical and chemical properties of Ni–Al2O3 catalysts Textural properties of NiAl–X catalysts were examined by nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm measurements. Fig. 1 (a) shows the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of NiAl–NH4OH, NiAl–KOH, NiAl–NaOH, and NiAl–Na2CO3 catalysts calcined at 700°C. All the samples exhibited IV-type isotherms with H2-type hysteresis loops, indicating the existence of well-developed framework mesopores [36–38]. However, hysteresis loops of NiAl–X catalysts appeared at slightly different relative pressure depending on the precipitation agent used in the sequential precipitation processes. Pore size distributions of the NiAl–X catalysts were within the range of typical mesopore, as shown in Fig. 1(b). Average pore size of the samples increased in the order of NiAl–NH4OH<NiAl–NaOH<NiAl–KOH≈NiAl–Na2CO3. Detailed physical and chemical properties of NiAl–NH4OH, NiAl–KOH, NiAl–NaOH, and NiAl–Na2CO3 catalysts calcined at 700°C are summarized in Table 1 . It was confirmed that all the NiAl–X catalysts retained nearly identical Ni/Al atomic ratio. This indicates that aluminum precursor and nickel precursor were successfully precipitated onto NiAl–X catalysts without significant loss of metal ion even after the sequential precipitation process followed by washing process. On the other hand, surface area and pore volume of the NiAl–X catalysts decreased in the order of NiAl–NH4OH>NiAl–KOH>NiAl–NaOH>NiAl–Na2CO3. Among the catalyst examined, NiAl–NH4OH retained the highest surface area and the largest pore volume. From these results, it is inferred that the precipitation agent strongly affects the physical properties of Ni–Al2O3 catalysts prepared by a sequential precipitation method."
7,Crystalline structure of Ni–Al2O3 catalysts,"3.2 Crystalline structure of Ni–Al2O3 catalysts Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of calcined NiAl–NH4OH, NiAl–KOH, NiAl–NaOH, and NiAl–Na2CO3 catalysts. It is interesting to note that all the catalysts exhibited quite similar diffraction patterns, regardless of the identity of precipitation agent. It was observed that no diffraction peaks indicative of nickel oxide species (JCPDS 44-1159, solid lines in Fig. 2) were detected in all the NiAl–X catalysts. This means that nickel species in the NiAl–X catalysts were finely dispersed on the surface of alumina support, resulting in the formation of small nickel particles that were under the detection limit of XRD measurement. Furthermore, typical diffraction peaks corresponding to pure γ-Al2O3 (JCPDS 10-0425, dashed lines in Fig. 2) were not observed in all the NiAl–X catalysts. This is because finely dispersed nickel species strongly interacted with alumina, resulting in the formation of nickel aluminate phase. A close examination of Fig. 2 revealed that (440) diffraction peak of γ-Al2O3 shifted to low diffraction angle in the NiAl–X catalysts. In other words, lattice of alumina was expanded by the incorporation of nickel ions in the NiAl–X catalysts (ionic radius of nickel is larger than that of aluminum) [39,40]. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of reduced NiAl–NH4OH, NiAl–KOH, NiAl–NaOH, and NiAl–Na2CO3 catalysts. It is noticeable that nickel aluminate phase in the calcined catalysts was completely reduced into metallic nickel (JCPDS 04-0805, solid lines in Fig. 3) and pure γ-Al2O3 (JCPDS 10-0425, dashed lines in Fig. 3) in the reduced catalysts. As a consequence, (440) diffraction peak of γ-Al2O3 moved back to the original diffraction angle in the reduced NiAl–X catalysts. However, crystalline sizes were quite different depending on the identity of precipitation agent. As listed in Table 2 , crystalline size of metallic nickel species decreased in the order of NiAl–Na2CO3 (11.0nm)>NiAl–NaOH (10.3nm)>NiAl–KOH (9.9nm)>NiAl–NH4OH (4.2nm). Among the catalysts examined, NiAl–NH4OH catalysts exhibited the smallest metallic nickel species. In other words, nickel species in the NiAl–NH4OH catalyst exhibited the strongest resistance toward sintering during the reduction process."
8,Metal–support interaction in the Ni–Al2O3 catalysts,"3.3 Metal–support interaction in the Ni–Al2O3 catalysts TPR measurements were carried out to investigate the interaction between nickel species and support in the Ni–Al2O3 catalysts. Fig. 4 shows the TPR profiles of NiAl–NH4OH, NiAl–KOH, NiAl–NaOH, and NiAl–Na2CO3 catalysts calcined at 700°C. All the catalysts exhibited a broad reduction band at around 800°C, corresponding to the reduction of surface nickel aluminate phase [41,42]. It has been reported that surface nickel aluminate phase has an intermediate metal–support interaction between bulk nickel aluminate–support and bulk nickel oxide–support interactions, and has relatively excellent stability due to its aluminate nature [39,40]. In the NiAl–X catalysts, therefore, nickel species were readily reduced into metallic nickel, as shown in Fig. 3. Hydrogen chemisorption measurements were conducted in order to elucidate the interaction between nickel species and alumina support, and to determine the nickel dispersion and nickel surface area in the Ni–Al2O3 catalysts. Nickel species in the calcined catalyst can be readily aggregated during the reduction process, resulting in poor nickel dispersion in the reduced catalyst. Therefore, strong resistance toward aggregation of nickel species during the reduction process is required for enhancing the dispersion of metallic nickel on the surface of reduced catalyst. Hydrogen chemisorption results for reduced NiAl–NH4OH, NiAl–KOH, NiAl–NaOH, and NiAl–Na2CO3 catalysts are listed in Table 3 . The amount of hydrogen uptake on the surface of reduced catalysts decreased in the order of NiAl–NH4OH>NiAl–KOH>NiAl–NaOH>NiAl–Na2CO3. As a result, nickel dispersion and nickel surface area in the reduced catalysts decreased in the order of NiAl–NH4OH>NiAl–KOH>NiAl–NaOH>NiAl–Na2CO3. Among the catalysts examined, NiAl–NH4OH catalyst exhibited the highest nickel dispersion and the highest nickel surface area. This can be understood by the fact that the highest surface area and the largest pore volume (Table 1) of NiAl–NH4OH catalyst not only caused the formation of surface nickel aluminate phase (Figs. 2 and 4), but also effectively suppressed the aggregation of nickel species during the reduction process (Fig. 3)."
9,Steam reforming of LNG over Ni–Al2O3 catalysts,"3.4 Steam reforming of LNG over Ni–Al2O3 catalysts Fig. 5 shows the LNG conversions and hydrogen compositions in dry gas with time on stream in the steam reforming of LNG over NiAl–NH4OH, NiAl–KOH, NiAl–NaOH, and NiAl–Na2CO3 catalysts at 600°C. All the NiAl–X catalysts exhibited a stable catalytic performance during the steam reforming reaction without significant deactivation. This means that all the NiAl–X catalysts can serve as potentially available catalysts for hydrogen production by steam reforming of LNG. Stable catalytic performance of NiAl–X catalysts can be explained by their favorable chemical and physical properties. Well-developed mesopores in the NiAl–X catalysts mitigated internal mass transfer resistance of reactant and product during the steam reforming reaction. Furthermore, finely dispersed nickel species, which were reduced from surface nickel aluminate phase, effectively suppressed the carbon deposition and nickel sintering through an acceleration of gasification reaction between adsorbed intermediate carbon species and adsorbed steam (OH2) or hydroxyl molecules (OH). Both LNG conversion and hydrogen composition in dry gas decreased in the order of NiAl–NH4OH>NiAl–KOH>NiAl–NaOH>NiAl–Na2CO3. Fig. 6 shows the correlations between nickel surface area and catalytic performance of NiAl–X catalysts in the steam reforming of LNG. It is interesting to note that both LNG conversion and hydrogen composition in dry gas increased with increasing nickel surface area. Although nickel surface area of the reduced catalyst is not the sole factor determining the catalytic performance in the steam reforming reaction, it can serve as an efficient correlating parameter for the catalytic performance in the steam reforming reaction. This is because dehydrogenation reaction of hydrocarbon species on the surface of active nickel site is the rate-determining step for overall steam reforming reaction [11,16,43]. Therefore, high catalytic performance can be obtained by enhancing the number of active nickel sites on the surface of reduced NiAl–X catalysts. Among the catalysts tested, NiAl–NH4OH catalyst with the highest nickel surface area exhibited the best catalytic performance in terms of LNG conversion and hydrogen composition in dry gas."
10,Characterization of used Ni–Al2O3 catalysts,"3.5 Characterization of used Ni–Al2O3 catalysts Fig. 7 shows the XRD patterns of NiAl–NH4OH, NiAl–KOH, NiAl–NaOH, and NiAl–Na2CO3 catalysts obtained after a 1000min-reaction at 600°C. All the NiAl–X catalysts retained metallic nickel species (solid lines in Fig. 7) even after the steam reforming reaction. Furthermore, significant sintering of metallic nickel species was not observed in the used NiAl–X catalysts. This is because nickel species strongly interacted with alumina through the formation of surface nickel aluminate phase in the NiAl–X catalysts, as revealed from XRD (Fig. 2) and TPR measurements (Fig. 4). However, both NiAl–NaOH and NiAl–Na2CO3 catalysts exhibited a diffraction peak for graphitic carbon, indicating the relatively severe carbon deposition during the steam reforming reaction. It was further observed that both NiAl–NaOH and NiAl–Na2CO3 catalysts retained relatively large amount of carbon compared to NiAl–KOH and NiAl–NH4OH catalysts, as listed in Table 4 . Carbon deposition reaction requires relatively large number of adjacent active nickel sites compared to steam reforming reaction [43]. In other words, carbon deposition reaction can be preferentially enhanced on the surface of NiAl–X catalysts with relatively poor nickel dispersion. On the other hand, NiAl–NH4OH catalyst with the highest nickel dispersion retained the strongest resistance toward carbon deposition. It is concluded that NiAl–NH4OH catalyst prepared by a sequential precipitation method using NH4OH solution as a precipitation agent served as an efficient catalyst for hydrogen production by steam reforming of LNG."
11,Conclusions,"A series of mesoporous Ni–Al2O3 catalysts (NiAl–X) were prepared by a sequential precipitation method using various basic solutions (NH4OH, KOH, NaOH, and Na2CO3) as precipitation agents for use in hydrogen production by steam reforming of LNG. The effect of precipitation agent on the physicochemical properties and catalytic activities of mesoporous NiAl–X (X =NH4OH, KOH, NaOH, and Na2CO3) catalysts in the steam reforming of LNG was investigated. Surface area and pore volume of NiAl–X catalysts decreased in the order of NiAl–NH4OH>NiAl–KOH>NiAl–NaOH>NiAl–Na2CO3. Nickel species were finely dispersed on the surface of NiAl–X (X =NH4OH, KOH, NaOH, and Na2CO3) catalysts through the formation of nickel aluminate phase. Nickel surface area decreased in the order of NiAl–NH4OH>NiAl–KOH>NiAl–NaOH>NiAl–Na2CO3. Both LNG conversion and hydrogen composition in dry gas increased with increasing nickel surface area of NiAl–X (X =NH4OH, KOH, NaOH, and Na2CO3) catalysts. Among the catalysts tested, NiAl–NH4OH catalyst with the highest nickel surface area showed the best catalytic performance in the steam reforming of LNG."
