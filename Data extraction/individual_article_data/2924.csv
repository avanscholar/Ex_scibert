0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2), the most abundant element in the universe, is a renewable energy source and has various technological applications such as chemical production (petroleum refineries, ammonia production, fertilizer production, metal refining …), food industry, fuel cell technology to produce electricity, fuel for transportation, fuel for rocket engines, etc. [1–3]. The detection of H2 is vital because H2 cannot be detected by human senses and H2 is non-toxic, the lightest element, colorless, odorless, tasteless, flammable, explosive above 4% concentrations in any ambient. H2 sensors are used for leak detection, safety issue, and real-time quantitative analysis, and another important recent usage of the H2 sensor is the diagnosis of the disease in the human digestive system [4–6]. The researchers have been studied on the H2 gas sensor to improve the sensor parameters such as sensitivity, selectivity, reversibility, operation temperature, power consumption, size, response, and recovery times. H2 sensors can be divided into seven categories depending on physicochemical detection mechanism and these are catalytic, electrochemical, resistor-based (metallic and semiconducting metal oxide), work function-based, mechanical, optical, and acoustic and these have been extensively studied [7–14]. Pt, Pd and their alloy with other metals are also used as a sensing layer for optical [10,15,16], magnetic [17,18], mechanic [19,20] hydrogen sensors and used as a functionalized layer for semiconductor resistive hydrogen sensors [21–24] and used as a contact material for work function based hydrogen sensors [25]. So, Pt, Pd and their alloy are vital for hydrogen sensors. Among them metallic resistor based H2 sensor has high sensor performance due to respond to wide hydrogen concentration range, rapid response, selective, long term stability, etc. [7]. In general, a metallic resistive type H2 sensor consists of a resistive transducer that has two, three, or four electrodes and a sensitive material such as palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), and their alloy [12–14,26]. The ab/adsorption of molecular H2 by Pd or Pt can cause physical property changes including mass, volume, magnetic and electric resistance, and these changes can be used to develop an H2 sensor. Compare to Pd based resistive H2 sensors, there are a few studies about Pt-based resistive H2 sensors. Different types of Pt nanostructures such as thin film [27–32], nanoporous film [33,34], nanowire [35–37], core-shell [38,39], and layered thin film [40,41] were fabricated for metallic resistive H2 sensor applications. According to our knowledge, this is the first study reported on Pt alloy structures for metallic resistive H2 sensor application. The advantages of this work can be summarized that the cost of metallic resistive H2 sensors decreases by alloying Pt with a low-cost material and high sensitivity is obtained for Pt-Ni alloy resistive H2 sensor. In this study, we fabricated pure Pt and Pt – Ni alloy thin films and investigated the H2 sensing properties of the films depending on alloy composition, temperature, and concentration. The goals of this work are (i) to coat Pt and Pt – Ni alloy thin films by using RF sputtering technique, (ii) to prepare an easily resistive type device, (iii) to study H2 gas sensing properties of the sensor devices in a wide concentration and temperature ranges, (iv) to explain sensing mechanism of the sensors and (v) to investigate the effect of Ni atom ratio in the alloy on to the sensor parameters."
1,Experimental,
2,Fabrication of Pt - Ni alloy thin films on the glass substrate,"2.1 Fabrication of Pt - Ni alloy thin films on the glass substrate The Pt and Pt-Ni alloy thin films are simultaneously deposited by using a radio frequency (RF) co-sputtering method with two high purity (99.99%) separated Pt and Ni targets on a microscope glass slide. Prior to film deposition, the substrates are cleaned with acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and high purity water. The thin films are coated with a constant RF power for each target at 5 mTorr argon (Ar) pressure during deposition by using a NANOVAK 400 PVD system and the total deposition rate is kept constant as 1 Å/s. The optimum sputtering conditions are investigated depending on RF power and Ar pressure. The atomic composition ratio of Pt and Ni in the alloy films is varied by changing the RF power applied to each target and the fabricated atomic compositions are pure Pt, 85% Pt – 15% Ni, 79% Pt – 21% Ni and 40% Pt – 60% Ni which samples are abbreviated with Pt100, Pt85, Pt79, and Pt40 respectively. The samples are summarized in Table 1 with deposition rate and measured atomic percentage. The substrates are rotated with 10 rpm during deposition and the thickness of the alloy thin films are approximately 3 nm that is monitored in situ during the deposition via a QCM from Inficon. The morphologies of Pt and Pt-Ni alloy thin films are studied by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM, ZEISS EVO 40) and the composition of the films is determined by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) attached directly to the SEM. The crystal structures of pure Pt and Pt-Ni alloy thin films are examined by X-ray diffraction (Rigaku Smartlab diffractometer) by using Cu Kα = 0.15418 nm radiation in the angle range of 20–90°."
3,Gas sensor measurements,"2.2 Gas sensor measurements In order to measure four-point resistance measurements, four Au pad electrodes were contacted on the top of Pt and Pt-Ni alloy thin films for H2 gas sensing measurements by using a thermal evaporator (NANOVAK 400 PVD system) with a shadow mask. Fig. 1a shows a schematic illustration for a resistive type thin film sensor device. The changes of resistance for each Pt and Pt alloy thin films were recorded by utilizing a four point-probe, which connected to a multimeter (Agilent 34410A). The H2 gas sensor measurement systems were composed of a flow-type aluminum measurement chamber including a heatable sample holder, a mass flow control unit (MKS), a temperature controller (Lakeshore 340), a multimeter, and gas cylinders as given in Fig. 1b. The volume of the measurement cell was 1 liter and a constant total gas flow rate of 200 sccm was applied. The concentrations of H2 in high purity nitrogen (N2) were varied from 25 ppm (per part million) to 1000 ppm. The resistances of Pt and Pt-Ni alloy thin film sensor devices were measured by changing atmospheric conditions in the measurement cell in situ at the temperature range from 25 °C to 200 °C. All measurement data were recorded using LabVIEW program with a GPIB data acquisition system connected to a personal computer."
4,Results and discussions,
5,Structural characterization,"3.1 Structural characterization SEM images of Pt alloy thin films for Pt85 and Pt79 samples are given in Fig. 2. All Pt and Pt alloy thin films are homogeneously covered on the glass surface. The surfaces of Pt85 and Pt79 samples seem to be quite smooth as seen in Fig. 2. Also, the same results are observed for Pt100 and Pt40 samples. In our previous study, pure Pt thin films were prepared with different thicknesses (from 2 nm to 50 nm) and observed smooth surface [30]. The XRD patterns for the Pt and Pt-Ni alloy thin films are displayed in Fig. 3a. The patterns show (111), (220), (200), and (131) Bragg reflections at the diffraction angle of 39.9°, 46.2°, 67.5°, and 81.5° respectively for Pt100 sample, and these diffraction peaks shift toward higher angles with increasing concentration of Ni in the alloy thin film. This behavior is evidence of the alloy formation. On the other hand, the lattice parameters of pure Pt and pure Ni thin films were obtained as 3.92 Å and 3.52 Å [42]. During Pt-Ni alloy formation Pt atoms replace with Ni atoms and the lattice constant of the unit cell decreases. So, the shift in the diffraction peak could be explained with a decrease in lattice constant caused by the replacement of Pt atoms with Ni atoms in the crystal lattice [43,44]. Similarly, diffraction peaks shift is observed for sputtered PtxNi100−x alloy thin films [42], Pt-Ni nanoparticles synthesized with organic solution [43,44], Pt-Ni nanocages synthesized with solvothermal method [45], and Pt-Ni nanowire synthesized by a surfactant-free method [46]. All diffraction peaks of Pt and Pt-Ni alloy thin films as seen in Fig. 3a have corresponded to a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystalline structure [42,47–49]. The EDX spectra for Pt79 alloy sample is shown in Fig. 3b and it is clearly seen Pt and Ni peaks from the spectra. The other peaks belong to oxygen(O), silicon (Si), sodium (Na), and calcium (Ca) are observed representing the glass substrate. The atomic percentage of Pt and Ni determined from EDX spectra of Pt and Pt-Ni alloy thin films on the glass substrate by excluding the substrate peaks."
6,Gas sensing,"3.2 Gas sensing The resistances of Pt and Pt-Ni alloy thin films are investigated under a high purity N2 flow at the temperature range from 25 °C to 200 °C. Fig. 4a and b demonstrates the resistance versus temperature graph of Pt100 and Pt79 thin film samples respectively. The resistances of both Pt100 and Pt79 samples increased up to 100 °C and then decreased with increasing temperature for the first measurement. The decrease in the resistance of the films above 100 °C could be elucidated with the desorption of oxygen molecules, water molecules, etc. at the film surface. But, we proposed that the whole adsorbed molecules could not be desorbed because the decreasing trend does not finish up to the high measured temperature of 200 °C. Besides, for the second measurement, the resistances of both Pt100 and Pt79 samples are linearly increased throughout the entire measured temperature interval due to their metallic structure. Similar behaviors are observed for Pt85 and Pt40 thin film samples. Previously, Tanaka et al. studied computational calculations for surface carrier scatterings on carrier transport in Pt nanosheets under ad/absorbed different gases and they observed the samples were in descending order of resistivity by ρ oxygen > ρ hydrogen > ρ clean [50]. In our case, the resistance of Pt and Pt-Ni alloy under nitrogen flow is lower than that of under standard atmospheric condition or laboratory condition. The resistance as a function of the atomic Ni content in alloy at room temperature for the second measurement is shown in Fig. 4c. The resistance of Pt100 decreased from 62,3 Ω to 34,7 Ω by fabrication of Pt85 alloy and the enhancement of atomic Ni content in alloy causes an increase in the resistance of the alloy. In general, the resistivity of the alloy could be explained with Matthiessen’s rule for dilute alloy (< 5% atomic content of the foreign in the alloy) and with Nordheim’s rule for concentrated alloy [51]. In our case, we prepared concentrated Pt-Ni alloy and the resistance measurement could be elucidated with Nordheim’s rule. According to Nordheim’s rule the resistivity of a concentrated alloy could be calculated by using the following equation [51]; (1) ρ = A + c ( 1 − B c ) Where A and B are constants that depend on the alloy series and c is the concentration of one component in the alloy. Previously, Blood and Grieg found a roughly parabolic graph for concentration dependence resistivity of Pd-Pt alloys [52]. Besides, Litschel and Pop investigated the electrical resistivity of Ni1−xPtx (x is varied from 0 to 30 at%) depending on temperature and found that the resistivities of Ni and Ni0,7Pt0,3 were 7,0.10−6 ohm cm and 33,3.10−6 ohm cm respectively [53]. On the other hand, the temperature coefficients of Pt100, Pt85, Pt79, and Pt40 thin film samples are calculated as 7,66.10−4 K−1, 8,92.10−4 K−1, 7,82.10−4 K−1, and 8,8.10−4 K−1 from the slope of the second measurement of resistance versus temperature graph, respectively. The H2 sensing properties of Pt and Pt-Ni alloy thin films are investigated depending on temperature and concentration. Fig. 5a–c shows the resistance versus time graphs of Pt100, Pt85, and Pt79 thin film samples at room temperature under various H2 concentrations respectively. After exposure to 50 ppm H2, the resistance of all Pt and Pt-Ni alloy thin films decreased for 20 min. After the measurement chamber is cleaned with high purity N2 flow, the resistance of the films increased slowly for 40 min. Similarly, the resistance of the films decreased when the other indicated concentrations of H2 (from 100 ppm to 1000 ppm) are exposed to the measurement chamber and increased during the cleaning with high purity N2 flow. The baseline of Pt and Pt – Ni alloy thin films are shifted at room temperature as seen in Fig. 5a–c. Previously, Patel et al. deposited thin nanoparticulate Pt films with a nominal thickness of 35 Å on SiO2 by using electron beam evaporation and investigated the structure and H2 response of the film depending on temperature and H2 concentration (10–1000 ppm) [27]. They reported that exposure to ppm level of H2 in the presence of 5% oxygen with nitrogen as the carrier gas caused decreases in electrical resistance and the sensitivity of the film became more pronounced with increasing temperature, indicating that the response mechanism for H2 sensing was an activated process. Yang et al. prepared Pd and Pt nanowires using lithographically patterned nanowire electrodeposition and reported the performance of a single Pt nanowire for detecting H2 in air comparison with Pd nanowire [35]. Yoo et al. fabricated Pt nanowire arrays using advanced lithographic techniques with a small cross-sectional dimension (10–40 nm), investigated H2 gas sensing properties of the nanowires, and explained the sensing mechanism with reduced electron scattering in the cross-section of the hydrogen adsorbed Pt nanowires [36]. In our case, the sensing mechanism of Pt thin films could be explained as follow; Pt does not form a bulk hydride phase upon exposure to H2 such as Pd [27,35,36]. A schematic diagram for the hydrogen sensing mechanism is given in Fig. 5d. After fabrication of Pt and Pt- Ni alloy thin film devices, they are stored at laboratory conditions, and the surface of the films is covered with adsorbed oxygen, water molecule, and so on. The resistances of the thin films are carried out under high purity N2 flow at the temperature range from room temperature to 200 °C and the adsorbed oxygen molecules could not be fully desorbed from the film surface as mentioned above. So, the surface of Pt thin film is covered with the absorbed oxygen atoms under high purity N2. While the hydrogen is exposed to Pt thin film, hydrogen atoms start to displace oxygen on the Pt surface. So, the decrease in the resistance of Pt thin film when exposed hydrogen could be related to decreasing the number of the surface charge carrier scattering. The ad/absorption and desorption of hydrogen and oxygen in N2 from Pt thin film surface could be explained with the following reactions [54–56]; (2) Pt + 1 2 O 2 → Pt – O (3) Pt – O + 3 2 H 2 → Pt – H + H 2 O When the molecular oxygen reacts with Pt surface in laboratory condition, chemisorbed oxygen atoms form as seen in reaction (2). If the atmosphere condition changes from normal laboratory condition to high purity N2, the chemisorbed oxygen atoms on Pt surface could not fully be desorbed even enhancing temperature up to 200 °C. When the indicated low concentration molecular hydrogen is exposed to the Pt thin film, hydrogen atoms displace oxygen atoms on the Pt surface with catalytic formation of water and its desorption from the Pt surface as presented in reaction (3). The sensitivities of Pt and Pt-Ni alloy thin films, an important parameter of a sensor, are calculated by using the equation as follow: (4) Sensitivity ( S % ) = Δ R R H x 100 = R 0 − R H R H x 100 where ∆ R is the variation in the resistance of the sensors and R 0 is the baseline resistance value for the sensor under N2 gas condition and R H is the resistance of the sensor while exposing to the indicated H2 concentration. The sensitivity of the sensor is analyzed depending on temperature and H2 concentrations. Fig. 6a and b shows the sensitivity versus time graphs of Pt-Ni alloy thin films at 100 °C and 150 °C exposed to H2 concentration from 30 ppm to 1000 ppm respectively. The sensitivities of Pt100, Pt85, and Pt79 thin films increased with increasing H2 concentration. The highest sensitivity is observed for Pt79 for all temperatures and measured H2 concentrations. The concentration-dependent sensitivity graph for Pt-Ni alloy thin films at the temperatures of 50 °C is plotted in Fig. 7a. The sensitivity of Pt-Ni alloy thin films increased with increasing H2 concentration and the highest sensitivity is observed for Pt79 (Pt79N21) sample for the all measured concentration range. Similar results are obtained for the other all measured temperatures. The effect of atomic Ni content in alloy on the sensitivity is shown in Fig. 7b where the sensitivity values of the alloy samples at 50 °C exposure to 1000 ppm H2 are used. The highest sensitivity is observed for Pt79 sample at the temperature of 50 °C and at all measured temperatures. Fig. 7c shows a plot of the sensitivity versus temperature for Pt-Ni alloy thin film exposure to 1000 ppm H2. Previously, Yang et al. found an increase in the sensitivity of Pt nanowire exposure to H2 with rising temperature and explained this behavior with thermally activated H2 detection [35]. The limit of detection (LOD) for Pt100, Pt85, Pt79, and Pt40 samples at 50 °C is below 1 ppm H2 as seen in Fig. 7a. LOD of the thin film sensors to H2 is calculated from fitting the concentration-dependent sensitivity graph and taking into account the resistance noise for 10 min under N2 flow. The response time is defined as the time required for 90% of the total resistance change while the sensor is exposed to the desired H2 concentration. Fig. 8a shows response times as a function of concentration at room temperature for Pt100, Pt85, and Pt79 thin film samples. The response time decreases with increasing concentration for all samples. Similar results were obtained for H2 sensor-based Pt nanostructures such as nanowire, thin film, etc. [30,35,36]. The temperature-dependent response time for Pt100, Pt85, and Pt79 thin film sensors exposed to 1000 ppm H2 is given in Fig. 8b. The response times of the thin film sensors decrease from about 10 min at room temperature to 0.5 min at 200 °C with enhancing temperature. The reason for the high response time in our case compared to the previously published paper could be related to high death volume and high measurement cell volume by considering the flow rate of 200 sccm. In order to compare Pt thin film based resistive H2 sensor, Table 2 shows state of the art publications. Considering the performances, the sensitivity value of Pt-Ni alloy sensor is better than most of the sensors reported about Pt thin film based metallic resistive H2 sensor. In a summary, Pt-Ni alloy thin film resistive H2 sensor is a good candidate for leak detection."
7,Conclusions,"Pt and Pt-Ni alloy thin films are coated on glass substrates by using the co-sputtering method, and structural, electrical and H2 sensing properties of these films are investigated depending on temperature and H2 concentration. Pt and Pt-Ni alloy thin films smoothly covered on all glass substrate, have a crystal structure, and the thickness of the films are about 3 nm. The resistances of Pt and Pt-Ni alloy thin films were directly proportional with temperature, and had a metallic characteristic. The H2 gas sensing measurement results revealed that the highest sensitivity is observed for Pt79Ni21 alloy thin film at all measured temperatures and in the concentration range from 25 ppm to 1000 ppm. The response time of the films decreases with rising both the temperature and the concentration. Pt-Ni alloy thin films could be potentially used for H2 leak detection, safety issue, and also for diagnosis by detection of molecular H2 in exhaled breath."
