0,Introduction,"Climate change and energy depletion are the two most serious challenges of the modern era [1]. With industrialization and rapid population growth, energy consumption has increased quickly over the past years and will continue increasing in the future [2]. There is still a high dependence on traditional fossil fuels, including coal, petroleum, and natural gas, although these fuels cause serious greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during combustion. They release additional carbon that had been sealed away from the ecosystem, which contributes greatly to global warming and climate change [3]. Table 1 demonstrates the GHG emissions of several major contributors and their global levels in 2014. Fig. 1 shows the temporal evolution (from 1990 to 2014) of GHG emissions of the world and these contributors. The emission data are cited from the World Resources Institute. In 2014, global GHG emissions reached up to 45740.70 million tons carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent (Mt CO2e) with the major component, CO2, accounting for 75.87% [5]. China, the European Union (EU), and the United States (U.S.) top the list of global GHG emissions-producing countries, and their combined emissions amount to more than half of the global total. Notably, in the past 10 years, the energy sector has been the primary source of GHG emissions. Taking 2014 as an example, GHG emissions from the energy sector accounted for 78% of the world total [5]. As for the three aforementioned largest contributors, their proportions of GHG emissions from the energy field all exceed 80% [5]. On the other hand, because fossil fuels are non-renewable, they cannot satisfy the soaring energy demand over the long term. Therefore, the utilization of renewable energy is urgently needed to reduce GHGs. As of 2012, more than 100 countries have established policies and targets for renewable energy [4]. Biogas is a common source of renewable bioenergy. It is derived from different feedstocks, which are usually devided into three generations. The first-generation feedstocks mainly involve seeds, grains and sugars. The second-generation feedstocks refer to lignocellulosic biomass like crop residues and woody crops [203]. In recent years, algae emerges as a promising third-generation feedstock due to the high growth rate and carbohydrate content [204], which has obtained increasing attention. In general, raw biogas is mainly composed of methane (CH4) (35–75%) and CO2 (25–55%). There are other minor components including nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), hydrogen (H2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), water vapor (H2O), carbon monoxide (CO), ammonia (NH3), siloxanes, and aromatics, as well as some dust particles. Table 2 illustrates the composition and physical properties of biogas from three different sources. Interest in biogas production has increased in many countries since the 1970s, derived from the growing concerns about energy stock and environmental problems. China is the largest developing country and the second largest energy user, exceeded only by the U.S. [11]. China is also the largest producer and consumer of biogas. As a vast agricultural country, China produces more than 700 million tons of straw each year [12], which is an important contributor to rural biogas generation. With the encouragement of governmental policies and regulations, bioenergy has received increasing attention and undergone rapid development, and biogas is a crucial part of this revolution. Since the 1980s, the number of biogas installations in China has continuously increased. In 2008, government investment in the biogas sector reached USD 943.8 million per year. By the end of 2010, there were 40 billion domestic biogas plants and 15.4 billion m3 of biogas were produced annually by these installations [13]. According to the 13th Five-year Plan for Renewable Energy Development published in 2016, the biogas supply reached 19 billion m3 in 2015 with an average annual growth rate of 6.3% compared to 2010, which could serve as a substitute for more than 11 million tons of standard coal per year. Biogas utilization is estimated to reach 44 billion m3 in 2020, of which rural biogas utilization will account for 30 billion m3. Other countries have also conducted substantial work on biogas production over the past decades. For example, total biogas production in Europe reached 10.9 metric tons in 2010, and some Asian countries, including India, had built 4.4 million domestic biogas installations by 2011 [13]. At the same time, increasing numbers of researchers have been studying the pathways of biogas utilization, including not only traditional ones such as heat and energy generation, but also new technologies such as conversion to hydrogen and liquid fuels. Another trend in recent years has been the development of biogas utilization from lower to higher end uses, to further develop the potential value of biogas and promote the industrialization and scaling of its utilization. To clarify the general status of biogas utilization, we first present an overview of existing biogas utilization and purification technologies. Then we focus on biogas dry reforming, the next-generation technology. The developments and progress in biogas dry reforming technology, particularly during the past 5 years, are summarized and discussed in detail. The effects of impurities in biogas on the dry reforming reaction are also highlighted. Based on these discussions, we draw conclusions and present future perspectives of further research on biogas dry reforming."
1,A sketch of biogas purification and utilization technologies,"Methane, a major component of biogas, is an abundant and important greenhouse gas in the troposphere, along with CO2 and water vapor. Since the 1700s, CH4 emissions have more than doubled owing to increasing human activities [14]. As shown in Table 1, CH4 accounts for a non-negligible proportion of global GHG emissions, 15.74%. The global warming potential per unit mass of CH4 is 25 times that of CO2 [15]. Direct emissions of CH4 in biogas will contribute to climate change. From another angle, the richness of this combustible component has promising potential uses, based on its heating value. However, as mentioned above, biogas contains some impurities such as N2 and H2S that may damage the fuel quality of biogas. Therefore, upgrading and purification technologies are necessary to control the levels of impurities, depending on the requirements of different utilization technologies. In this section, we present common technologies for biogas upgrading and purification. Then traditional and new technologies are discussed to provide a brief overview of biogas utilization."
2,Biogas upgrading and purification technologies,"2.1 Biogas upgrading and purification technologies Recently, biogas upgrade and purification technologies have been systematically studied. Awe et al. [8] provided a detailed review of biogas upgrading, focusing on CO2, H2S, and water removal. Imran et al. [9] reported the state of the art of biogas upgrading, with concerns about upgrading efficiency, methane loss, environmental effects, and commercialization, including the utilization and storage of biogas. Miltner et al. [16] presented new innovations and advanced solutions for biogas upgrading. Gaj [17] summarized the known methods for removing siloxanes together with other impurities. Munoz et al. [18] reviewed the removal of CO2, H2S, H2O, and trace components such as siloxanes, halocarbons, O2, and N2, with a special focus on biotechnologies. Mainstream technologies for biogas upgrading and purification include absorption (physical and chemical), adsorption, membrane technology, cryogenic technology, and biological methods. 2.1.1 Absorption Absorption is based on the separation principle that different gases have different solubilities in liquid solvents. Physical absorption mainly involves high-pressure water scrubbing (HPWS) and organic physical scrubbing (OPS). HPWS is a mature technology widely used in industry because water is a very inexpensive and available solvent. Compressed biogas enters the absorption column from the bottom and water enters counter-currently, with an operating pressure of 6–10 bar (a) [19]. In this case, CO2 and H2S can be removed from biogas together because they have higher solubilities than CH4 in water. OPS is similar to HPWS in terms of absorption principles, but organic scrubbing solutions, in which CO2 and H2S have greater solubility, are used instead of water. Thus, less solvent volume and electricity consumption are needed. Methanol, N-methyl pyrrolidone, propylene carbonate, and polyethylene glycol ethers are common solvents used in the OPS method [9,20]. Chemical absorption depends on the chemical reactions between gases and solvents. A counter-current process similar to physical absorption is conducted in the chemical scrubber system with a lower operating pressure of 1–2 bar (a) [9]. Generally, alkanolamine solutions or inorganic alkaline solutions are used to remove CO2 and H2S. The most common absorbents used include monoethanolamine, dimethylethanolamine, diglycolamine, methyldiethanolamine, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, and ammonia [21]. 2.1.2 Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) This method depends on differences in van der Waals forces between various gases and the surfaces of adsorbents. It is also a widely used technology in industry, and can obtain a high CH4 concentration of 97% and CH4 recovery rate of 94% [22]. In this case, raw biogas is first injected onto an adsorption column, in which CO2, H2S, N2, water, and other impurities are adsorbed onto porous adsorbents under elevated pressure of 4–10 bar (a) [23]. After the adsorbents are saturated with CO2, biogas is fed onto another column. The pressure in the saturated column is reduced and CO2 is desorbed. Several columns must be opened and closed in sequence to conduct a continuous PSA operation [24]. Proper adsorbents used in PSA should have a high specific area and porosity, as well as good adsorbent capacity and selectivity for different gases. Common adsorbents include carbon molecular sieves, zeolites, activated carbon, synthetic resins, and silica gels. Recently, novel materials have been applied in the PSA process. Wu et al. [25] synthesized a new adsorbent metal organic framework (MOF), MOF 508b, which decreased the energy consumption of PSA. Novel material Mg-MOF-74 prepared by Bao et al. [26] showed much better adsorption capacities for CO2 and CH4 than zeolite 13X. 2.1.3 Membrane technology Membrane separation is based on the selective permeability of membranes. The driving force for separation comes from the pressure differential between the two sides of the membrane. Membrane separation mainly involves gas–gas separation under high pressure or gas–liquid separation by absorption. Gas–gas separation is operated at high pressures of 20–40 bar [8], or in some systems under 8–10 bar [24]. In this process, CO2, H2S, and other impurities permeate through the membrane while CH4 is retained, obtaining higher CH4 concentrations. Gas–liquid separation is operated at pressures close to atmospheric pressure, and CO2 and H2S pass through the membrane and are removed by absorption solutions similar to chemical absorption on the other side of the membrane. Common commercial membranes are made of organic polymers such as polyimide and polycarbonate, or inorganic materials such as zeolites, activated carbon, and MOFs. 2.1.4 Cryogenic technology Cryogenic separation is a newly developed method based on differences in the boiling temperatures and pressures of various components in biogas. Typically, biogas is cooled to 173–203 K at a high pressure of 40 bar. During the process of condensation and distillation, CO2, H2S, water, N2 and other impurities are separated. This method can harvest high purity CH4 and CO2. However, the series of heat exchangers and compressors necessary for cryogenic separation greatly increase the capitalized cost, operational cost, and energy consumption. 2.1.5 Biological methods Aimed at H2S removal, traditional bio-desulfurization technology has been widely applied in the biogas industry. Biogas is injected onto a filter together with 2–5% air to provide a proper environment for desulfurization bacteria to oxidize H2S into elemental sulfur. This method is usually combined with water scrubbing, where the filter provides enough area for gas–liquid contact and bacteria growth. Shell-Paques technology, which is a two-stage process involving adsorption and bio-oxidation, is also an effective method for H2S removal [21]. Fatemeh Nazari et al. [27] isolated an efficient bacteria, Halothiobacillus sp. ISOB 14, which has a good capacity for H2S removal and sulfate production. Maikel Fernandez et al. [28] studied biogas biodesulfurization in an anoxic biotrickling filter packed with open-pore polyurethane foam, and obtained a high removal efficiency of 99% under optimal conditions. As for methane enrichment, an innovative technology is based on hydrogenotropic methanogens, by which CO2 and H2 are converted into CH4 by microorganisms. In this case, a high CH4 concentration of 98% was achieved in product gas [9]. Kim et al. [29] reduced CO2 discharged from the electronics industry to produce CH4 via H2 injection. Recently, the use of microalgae has been proposed as a new alternative for CO2 removal from biogas and receives increasing attention. Meier et al. [205] used microalga Chlorella sorokiniana in an open-photobioreactor for biogas purification and got CO2 removal efficiencies between 89% and 93% during the light/dark cycles. Yan et al. [206] used the microalgae bag photobioreactor to achieve simultaneously biogas upgrading and biogas slurry decontamination via the photosynthetic of microalgae. Wang et al. [207] reported that the co-cultures of microalgae with either fungi or activated sludge could significantly enhance the efficiency of simultaneously biogas upgrading and wastewater purifying."
3,First-generation biogas utilization,"2.2 First-generation biogas utilization Because CH4 is a major component of biogas, it is typical to use upgraded biogas directly as a source of energy to produce heat and electricity. Several common methods have been extensively applied in industrial processes: production of heat and steam, combined heat and electricity generation, injection into natural gas networks, and conversion into compressed biogas and liquefied biogas (LBG). 2.2.1 Production of heat and steam Heat and steam production is the traditional method of biogas utilization. Biogas is an important source of energy for cooking and lighting in many countries [30]. Improving heat production from biogas burning remains a topic of research. Li et al. [31] found that H2-enriched and O2-enriched conditions helped improve the combustion and heat-releasing characteristics of biogas. In addition, biogas combustion in boilers to produce steam has been widely used because this process has a high tolerance of biogas purity, often without the need for H2S removal. 2.2.2 Combined heat and electricity generation Combined heat and power (CHP) is a concept first promoted by the Council of the European Union in 1974 [32]. As the generation of heat and electricity can be achieved simultaneously, it has attracted increasing attention over the past decades. Biogas is a promising and economical fuel for this procedure. The efficiency of CHP units can reportedly be classified as 90% (40% electrical and 50% thermal) under optimal conditions [33]. Currently, CHP plants are widely used and have become a mainstream part of the biogas sector in Germany, the UK, Denmark, and the U.S. [34]. For this technology, H2S levels in biogas should be limited to within 250 ppm to avoid corrosion of the engines in CHP units [35]. 2.2.3 Injection into natural gas networks As many countries will face shortages of natural gas resources in the near future, it is crucial for biogas to serve as a substitute for natural gas. Before injection into natural gas grids, biogas must be purified using effective methods such as absorption and membrane separation, as mentioned in Section 2.1, to avoid equipment erosion and to attain the standards of natural gas. Standards for gas quality vary among different countries. For example, the U.S. requires a minimum CH4 content of 93.5–95.5% and maximum H2S content of 6–88 mg/m3, whereas the EU requirements for minimum CH4 and maximum H2S are 70–98% and 2–15 mg/m3, respectively [35]. 2.2.4 Conversion into compressed biogas Purified biogas (with CH4 content higher than 97%) is usually converted into compressed biogas, also called bio-compressed natural gas (bio-CNG), at 20–25 MPa [9] or liquefied into LBG at −162 °C [33] to reduce storage volume and improve product quality for further use. With the depletion of fossil fuels, bio-CNG is being used as vehicle fuel owing to its similar properties to compressed natural gas (CNG). Sweden has advanced experience from using biogas as vehicle fuel since 1996, and first created the related standards for this utilization path [21]. This has also become an important strategy in many other European countries such as France, Germany, and the UK. For heavy vehicles, bio-CNG is particularly environmentally friendly, with lower emissions of sulfur, lead, and GHGs compared to CNG and other fuels [36]."
4,Second-generation biogas utilization,"2.3 Second-generation biogas utilization In first-generation technologies, biogas is treated directly as a fuel for heat or electrical power production, or converted into another form without essential chemical changes. In recent years, many researchers have shifted to new directions aimed at further exploring the value of biogas. Second-generation ideas, based on catalytic reactions, have cast biogas in the role of a chemical material, a source of growing interest. During such reactions, biogas is expected to form higher-value products that could have better applications in chemical engineering and other areas. These second-generation biogas utilization methods mainly include production of syngas/hydrogen, production of biomethanol, and production of higher hydrocarbons and alcohols. 2.3.1 Production of syngas/hydrogen Syngas is a mixture consisting mainly of CO and H2. It is an attractive and valuable gas material that has many potential applications in chemical engineering, including the production of methanol, Fischer-Tropsch oil, gasoline, and other chemical products. Syngas can be produced based on catalytic reforming reactions, usually by steam, dry, or partial oxidative reforming of methane. Steam reforming has been widely used in scaled industry for hydrogen generation. It is reported that 80–85% of H2 in the world is produced by steam reforming [37]. The main reaction, shown as Eq. (1), usually coexists with the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction shown in Eq. (2) [38]. Ni-based catalysts are often used, but new catalysts with better performance have been a source of continuous study in recent years. Janewit Phromprasit et al. [39] synthesized Ni-Zr-CaO and Ni-Ce-CaO catalysts to enhance steam reforming. Daneshmand-Jahromi et al. [40] investigated a Ni/SBA-16 oxygen carrier modified by an yttrium promoter and attained the highest CH4 conversion (99.83%) at 650 °C. (1) CH4 + H2O ↔ CO + 3H2, ΔHo = 206.8 kJ/mol (2) CO + H2O ↔ CO2 + H2, ΔHo = −41.2 kJ/mol Dry reforming is a promising method for converting the two major components in biogas, CH4 and CO2, together into syngas, as shown in Eq. (3). Generally, a temperature of 700–900 °C is required because the reaction is endothermic. As in steam reforming, catalysts play a vital role in syngas production. Ni-based catalysts have attracted great attention owing to their low cost. Nevertheless, problems with carbon deposition may damage the performance of catalysts. Compared to non-noble metal catalysts, noble metal catalysts, including Ru-, Rh-, and Pt-based catalysts, perform better in controlling carbon deposition and increasing the conversion rate [41]. (3) CH4 + CO2 ↔ 2CO + 2H2, ΔHo = 247.3 kJ/mol Partial oxidative reforming is the process of partial oxidation converting CH4 into syngas via adding O2, as shown in Eq. (4). It is an exothermic reaction, and dominates under temperatures below 600 °C [37]. It can be combined with steam and dry reforming to reach a balance between absorption and heat release as tri-reforming. Recently, Chai et al. [42] developed a Ni-foam-structured nanocomposite catalyst to enhance the partial oxidative reaction, and its operating conditions have also been studied. Hassan, Muzamil A et al. [43] investigated the partial oxidation of methane under a supercritical water environment at 658 K and 26 MPa. higher O2/CH4 ratios may lead to better syngas production [44]. (4) C H 4 + 1 2 O 2 ↔ CO + 2 H 2 , Δ H ∘ = - 35.6 kJ / mol 2.3.2 Production of biomethanol Demand for methanol has greatly increased owing to its importance in chemical engineering, the pharmaceuticals industry, and the textile industry. It can be used to produce formaldehyde, dimethyl ether, acetic acid, dimethylformamide, methylamine, and other chemicals. The production of methanol from methane has become a hot issue in recent years, with many advanced studies. Shan et al. [45] reported in Nature that mononuclear Rh/zeolite and Rh/TiO2 catalysts can directly convert CH4 to methanol and acetic acid under mild conditions of 150 °C, with the help of O2 and CO. Also in Nature, Benjamin et al. [46] provided deep insight into the mechanism underlying the active site in low-temperature CH4 hydroxylation in iron-containing zeolites. Vitaly et al. [47] reported in Science that a copper-containing zeolite directly converted CH4 into methanol with high selectivity (97%). Grundner et al. [48] found that the mordenite micropores in copper-exchanged zeolites contributed to the highly selective stabilization of trinuclear copper-oxo clusters, which is crucial for the conversion of CH4 into methanol. 2.3.3 Production of higher hydrocarbons and alcohols The production of higher hydrocarbons and alcohols via biogas has garnered increasing attention. Microbiological methods are often used to produce hydrocarbons, whereas materials such as Al–Co–Ni–Cr-based catalysts are also effective for biogas conversion into higher hydrocarbons [49]. For higher alcohols, few direct conversions have been reported, whereas indirect methods, which first produce syngas by reforming and then convert syngas into higher alcohols, have been well developed. Syngas fermentation is a promising technology for producing ethanol and butanol via the acetyl-CoA pathway in microorganisms [37]. In addition, novel catalysts such as Fe-, Ni-, or Co-modified methanol synthesis catalysts, and alkali-modified Mo-based catalysts have been studied for the purpose of producing higher alcohols [50]. Now we present an overview of biogas utilization. In traditional first-generation technologies, biogas is usually used directly, whereas newer technologies focus on exploring higher value uses of biogas and have a broader research prospective. Among these existing technologies, dry reforming is a particularly competitive pathway because it makes full use of both CH4 and CO2, the two major components of biogas. There is no requirement to first separate these two gases, thus saving the cost of separation and avoiding CO2 waste. Therefore, dry reforming is presented and discussed in detail in the following sections."
5,Reaction chemistry of dry reforming,"The main reaction in dry reforming is the conversion of CH4 and CO2 into syngas, as shown in Eq. (3). It is a typical endothermic reaction; thus, high temperatures are required to promote the conversion toward syngas. Apart from the main reaction, other reactions can also occur simultaneously during the dry reforming process. One typical side reaction is reverse water gas shift (RWGS), presented in Eq. (5), which can decrease the H2/CO ratio in the syngas product. Although it may be unwelcome in syngas generation, this reaction contributes to proper adjustment of the H2/CO ratio for the production of higher hydrocarbons [2]. The RWGS reaction also leads to a higher conversion of CO2 than CH4 [51]. (5) CO2 + H2 ↔ CO + H2O, ΔHo = 41 kJ/mol Coke deposition is a common problem in reforming that can greatly damage the activity of catalysts by blocking the cores and tubes or triggering the collapse of catalyst support [52]. It may be derived from any gas containing carbon elements. Some important side reactions contributing to coke formation may occur during the dry reforming process. Eq. (6) shows the decomposition of CH4, in which CH4 completely decomposes into solid carbon covering the surface of catalysts and H2 is emitted. Eq. (7) shows the disproportionation of CO, also called the Boudouard reaction. Eqs. (8) and (9) present the hydrogenation of CO2 and CO, respectively, by which carbon oxides react with H2 to produce solid carbon and water vapor. (6) CH4 ↔ C + 2H2, ΔHo = 74.9 kJ/mol (7) 2CO ↔ C + CO2, ΔHo = −172.4 kJ/mol (8) CO2 + 2H2 ↔ C + 2H2O, ΔHo = −90 kJ/mol (9) CO + H2 ↔ C + H2O, ΔHo = −131.3 kJ/mol According to the Gibbs free-energy calculation [53], the decomposition of CH4 mainly occurs at temperatures higher than 553 °C, and the Boudouard reaction mainly occurs at temperatures below 700 °C. Therefore, 553–700 °C is the temperature range at which coke deposition readily occurs. The tendency toward coke deposition is also related to the ratios of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in raw gas. Lower O/C and H/C ratios lead to a higher coke tendency. Thus, coke deposition is more likely to occur in dry reforming than in steam and partial oxidative reforming [54]. Fig. 2 shows the limiting temperature curves of coke deposition under various CO2/CH4 feed ratios and operating pressures [53], which suggest that higher pressures lead to higher limiting temperatures. On the other hand, at the same operating pressure, decreasing the CO2/CH4 feed ratio increases the limiting temperature. In biogas, the CH4 content is usually higher than that of CO2, which is not beneficial for avoiding coke production. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the CO2/CH4 feed ratio to less than 1 when biogas is applied in dry reforming."
6,Recent advances in biogas dry reforming,
7,Catalyst development,"4.1 Catalyst development 4.1.1 Active metals Noble metals (including Pt, Pd, Rh, Ir, and Ru) and non-noble metals (including Ni, Fe, and Co) have been investigated in catalyst synthesis for the biogas dry reforming reaction. Noble metal catalysts are very attractive due to their high catalytic activity and greater resistance to coke deposition. For single-metal-based catalysts, a systematic comparison of different noble metals was conducted by Hou et al. [55]. Rh, Ru, Pt, Pd, and Ir at 5 wt% were respectively loaded on α-Al2O3 supports for dry reforming model biogas with a CO2/CH4 feed ratio of 1:1. Rh had an outstanding activity and stability among the five noble metal species. The catalytic activity exhibited the trend of Rh > Ru > Pd > Ir > Pt (30 min on stream) and Rh > Ru > Ir > Pd > Pt (240 min on stream), which indicates that the stability of the Pd/α-Al2O3 catalyst was lower than that of the Ir/α-Al2O3 catalyst. This could be explained by the phenomenon that the Pd/α-Al2O3 catalyst produced 4.9 mg/gcat h carbon deposition, whereas the others produced no carbon deposition. In addition, the dispersion of Rh on α-Al2O3 decreased with the loading amount. More recently, Yasin Khani et al. [56] synthesized novel nanocatalysts of 3% Ru/ZnLaAlO4 and 3% Pt/ ZnLaAlO4. These catalysts were applied to dry reforming model biogas with a CO2/CH4 feed ratio of 1:1, as well as in steam and combined dry-steam reforming of CH4. They showed high catalytic activity and stability, and almost no coke deposition. Ru/ZnLaAlO4 at 3% performed better than 3% Pt/ZnLaAlO4 in dry reforming, with CH4 conversion at 800 °C reaching 89.2%. Although noble metal catalysts have better coke resistance and sometimes perform better in terms of catalytic activity, their high costs largely limit their industrial application. Therefore, non-noble metal (Ni, Fe, and Co) catalysts have gained much attention as low-cost materials. Among these non-noble metals, Ni is the most studied and most frequently used on the industrial scale [2]. Osaze Omoregbe et al. [57] investigated the dry reforming catalytic activity of 10% Ni/SBA-15 under different operating parameters. The CH4 and CO2 conversions reached 91 and 94%, respectively, at 750 °C with CO2 and CH4 partial pressures of 20 kPa. Charisiou et al. [58] synthesized a Ni/Al2O3 catalyst (8.0 wt% Ni) for dry reforming simulated biogas with a CO2/CH4 feed ratio of 1:1.5, attaining CH4 and CO2 conversions of approximately 72 and 92%, respectively, at 850 °C. Ehsan Akbari et al. [59] synthesized a Ni-MgO-Al2O3 catalyst and investigated the effects of Ni content on catalyst behavior. In the range of 2.5–15.0 wt%, they concluded that the CH4 and CO2 conversions increased with increased Ni loading, owing to increased access to nickel active sites. Recently, Pfeiffer et al. proposed a novel modified process in which Ni-based catalysts were used as bifunctional materials for CO2 capture and subsequent methane dry reforming. They used both NiO-impregnated CaO material and CaO-NiO composite for this process and showed that NiO-impregnated CaO material performed better [201]. Besides, they also showed that NiO-doped sodium zirconate ceramics are promising materials for CO2 capture and CH4 dry reforming [202]. However, obvious carbon deposition is usually observed with Ni catalysts [54,56,57], which is the major obstacle in the application of Ni-based catalysts [60]. To solve this problem, recent studies have explored a path for modifying Ni-based catalysts with noble metals. Hou et al. [55] used a small amount of Rh to modify a Ni-based catalyst on meso-porous Al2O3 (Yas3–8). As with the pure Ni catalyst, a high coke formation rate of 17.2 mgcoke/gcat h was observed, and the CH4 and CO2 conversions were only 62.0 and 68.4%, respectively, at 800 °C. By contrast, Rh-promoted Ni/Yas3–8 produced no carbon deposition when Rh addition was higher than Rh/Ni > 0.1. The added noble metal also enhanced the reducibility and reforming activity, owing to the synergetic effects of Rh and Ni. The CH4 and CO2 conversions increased to approximately 80% when 5 wt% Rh was added. Cheng et al. [61] used a series of noble metals (Ru, Pd, and Ag) to produce a Ni/ La2O3-ZrO2 catalyst for dry reforming of coke oven gas, among which Ru was the most effective. The 0.1 Ru-10Ni/8LZ catalyst exhibited the highest catalytic activity, with high CH4 and CO2 conversions of 96.0 and 97.2%, respectively, at 800 °C. Igor Luisetto et al. [62] investigated a Ru-promoted Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst in powder and structured forms. For both forms, the Ru-promoted catalyst showed remarkable advantages in catalytic activity and stability compared to the Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. This suggests that Ru can maintain the catalyst surface in the reduced state and inhibit the formation of Ni2+, which leads to catalyst deactivation. Apart from the Ni-noble metal catalysts, other bimetallic catalysts using transition metals (Co, Fe, and Cu) for biogas dry reforming have also drawn increased attention. Although Co, Fe, and Cu do not show good activity when used in monometallic catalysts [63], they could potentially play vital roles in bimetallic catalysts. Wang et al. [64] compared the Ni/CaO-ZrO2 catalysts modified by Fe, Co, and Cu for dry reforming of simulated biogas with a CO2/CH4 feed ratio of 1:1. All three metals improved the initial catalytic activity compared to pure Ni catalyst. Co is the most suitable metal for modifying Ni/CaO-ZrO2 catalysts, owing to the electron interactions between Ni and Co, which help disperse metal alloys and suppress the formation of toxic carbon deposition species. Xu et al. [65] synthesized Ni, Co, and Ni-Co catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3-La2O3 and found that Co inhibited carbon deposition by enhancing CO2 adsorption, due to a strong Co-O interaction [63]. This ability has also been supported by other studies [66–68]. Nevertheless, it is crucial to control the Ni/Co ratio. Fig. 3 a illustrates that a proper Ni/Co ratio of 7:3 is best for catalytic activity, whereas too much Co will cause the opposite effect, which makes the catalyst vulnerable to oxidation and thus causing deactivation [69]. Fig. 3b and c show that metal particles were well segregated from each other and suffered no sintering. The metallic particle size of 7Ni3Co/LaAl was smaller than that of 10Ni/LaAl, which had the benefit of suppressing carbon formation. Carvalho et al. [70] investigated Ni-Fe and Co-Fe catalysts and revealed that the main compositions of the catalysts were γ-Fe2O3, NiO, α-Fe2O3, and NiFe2O4 for the Ni-Fe series; and Co3O4, CoO, and CoFe2O4 for the Co-Fe series. Co-Fe catalysts with lower Co/Fe ratios showed better performance due to elevated textural properties, whereas Ni-Fe catalysts suffered from sintering effects. Sintering was controlled by adding Pd with a Ni/Pd molar ratio of approximately 75, which stabilized the Fe–Ni alloy with a thin Fe–Ni–Pd surface layer [71]. Wu et al. [72] synthesized a Ni-Cu catalyst supported on hierarchical SiO2, in which a Cu/Ni ratio of 1:3 was favored. They concluded that adding Cu promoted catalytic activity and sintering resistance due to strong metal–support interactions and well-dispersed small metal nanoparticles. The role of active metals on catalyst performance is summarized in Table 3 . In recent years, the core-shell structure has become a popular topic due to its advantages in physicochemical properties for preventing sintering and carbon deposition [73]. Zhang et al. [74] developed a nanostructured Ni@SiO2 core-shell catalyst using a facile method. The porous silica shell effectively inhibited sintering and coking, giving rise to the high stability and activity of coated nickel cores. Zhao et al. [75] prepared a NiCe@m-SiO2 yolk-shell framework catalyst. The addition of CeO2 was vital for creating more active oxygen species on the support and dispersing the Ni nanoparticles well. The yolk-shell framework played an important role by providing more active centers of Ni for the gaseous reactants, which helped improve the sintering resistance of the Ni nanoparticles. Thus, the catalyst had better catalytic activity, stability, and coking-resistance than the NiCe/SiO2 and Ni/SiO2 catalysts. Bian et al. [76] synthesized a multicore-shell catalyst derived from Ni-Mg phyllosilicate nanotubes (PSNT)@silica using a modified Stöber method with trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a surfactant and structure-directing agent. They reported that the multicore-shell catalyst showed a high and stable conversion during a 72 h durability run at 750 °C, and better coke resistance than uncoated catalyst. As shown in Fig. 4 a, Ni-Mg PSNTS@silica showed no obvious sintering after the stability test, and the multicore-shell structure remained clear. By contrast, the uncoated Ni-Mg PSNTS in Fig. 4b showed a great deal of carbon formation, and no longer maintained nanotubular structure. This is consistent with the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) profiles (Fig. 4c and d), showing a sharp differential thermal analysis (DTA) peak indicating the existence of carbon deposition in Ni-Mg PSNTS, whereas no peak was found for Ni-Mg PSNTS@silica. From this perspective, catalysts with a core-shell structure are promising for biogas dry reforming as well as other catalytic reactions such as biomass gasification, although there are still obstacles to its application, such as difficulty controlling core size and shell thickness, and catalytic activity damage due to the shell-block effect [73]. 4.1.2 Catalyst support Generally, there are two main components in a catalyst: the active metal and the support material. The support material plays a critical role by providing a large surface area for the dispersion of the active metal. It is widely believed that biogas dry reforming follows a bi-functional mechanism in which CH4 is activated on the metal and CO2 is activated on acidic or basic supports [41,84]. Several common supports have been extensively studied over the years, including SiO2, Al2O3, MgO, ZrO2, TiO2, La2O3, and CeO2. SiO2 is deemed a relatively inert material because it has weaker interactions with metal and thus is less active [41], but it is widely applied in catalysts due to its low cost and high stability. Al2O3 is a mild acidic support used in catalysts. More than 10 types of crystal structures of Al2O3 have been found to date; the most common types used in industry involve α-Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3. Bychkov et al. [85] compared α-Al2O3, γ-Al2O3, and θ-Al2O3 in terms of behavior as supports for Ni-based catalysts in biogas dry reforming. They reported that the catalytic activity and carbon resistance showed the trend of Ni/γ-Al2O3 > Ni/θ-Al2O3 > Ni/α-Al2O3. Basic supports such as MgO, La2O3, CeO2, and ZrO2 have also been heavily investigated. Sokolov et al. [86] prepared a series of Ni-based catalysts using different supports, including Ni/Al2O3, Ni/MgO, Ni/TiO2, Ni/SiO2, and Ni/ZrO2, and tested them in low-temperature (400 °C) dry reforming with a CO2/CH4 feed ratio of 1:1. Based on H2 yields after the first 1–10 h, they concluded that the catalytic activity showed the tendency of Ni/ZrO2 > Ni/TiO2 > Ni/MgO > Ni/Al2O3 > Ni/SiO2. Most recently, Joung Woo Hana et al. [80] synthesized new catalytic materials and conducted an enlightening study to investigate the particle size and support effects separately. Ni nanoparticles were first loaded onto SiO2 with the same size of 5.2 nm. Then, overlayers of different metal oxides, including Al2O3, MgO, ZrO2, TiO2, and also SiO2 itself, were synthesized respectively as coatings onto Ni/SiO2 via the sol-gel method. Based on the initial CH4 and CO2 conversion, the catalytic activity showed the tendency of Ni/SiO2@Al2O3 > Ni/SiO2@MgO > Ni/SiO2@SiO2 > Ni/SiO2@ZrO2 > Ni/SiO2@TiO2. The authors claimed that the enhanced activity of the Al2O3 and MgO overlayers was derived from their greater CO2 adsorption. Apart from single supports, many researchers have focused on catalysts based on mixed supports. Ji-Eun Min et al. [87] investigated the performance of Ni/MgO-Al2O3 catalysts systematically at various Mg/Al ratios (15 wt% Ni). Higher catalytic activity and carbon resistance were observed at MgO/(MgO + Al2O3) ratios of 0.44–0.86. The basic surface property of MgO helps inhibit carbon formation by enhancing CO2 adsorption onto the catalyst, and adsorbed CO2 reacts with C, thus regenerating the catalyst [88]. This promotional effects of MgO was also reported by Rajib Kumar Singha et al. [81], who synthesized a Ni-MgO/ZnO catalyst using a hydrothermal method with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as a cationic surfactant. This catalyst showed good activity, with a product H2/CO ratio close to 1, and no deactivation for more than 100 h. Besides enhancing the adsorption of CO2, adding MgO also increased the dispersion of Ni and decreased the Ni particle size. A strong Ni-ZnO interaction was observed, which contributed to the high carbon resistance. Reddy et al. [89] synthesized a Pt/ZrO2-SiO2 catalyst using the deposition-precipitation method. The catalytic performance relied on the ZrO2/SiO2 ratio, with the highest activity at 4:1, followed by pure ZrO2 > 3:1 > 2:1 > pure SiO2. Kambolis et al. [90] investigated Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts for dry reforming simulated biogas with a CO2/CH4 feed ratio of 1:1. They reported that Zr altered the electronic environment of cerium ions, leading to higher stability and oxygen mobility. The addition of Zr helped improve catalytic activity due to the greater surface density of active sites, whereas the degree of Zr influence depended on the Ce/Zr ratio. This enhanced activity was also confirmed by Akpan et al. [91]. Further, Michalis A. Vasiliades et al. [92] investigated the effects of CeO2-ZrO2 structural differences on carbon formation during biogas dry reforming. New methods including the transient technique and steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) experiments (using 18O2 and 13CO2) were applied to analyze the carbon origin and reactivity. Co (1.8 wt%) and Ni (1.2 wt%) were dispersed over a Ce0.75Zr0.25O2–δ solid solution (3NiCo EG) or a mixture of CeO2 and ZrO2 single phases (3NiCo HT). They found that the rate of carbon deposition and carbon types depended on the structure of the supports. Compared to 3NiCo HT, 3NiCo EG promoted the rate of CH4 decomposition and carbon removal, showing less carbon deposition in dry reforming reactions. Mesoporous materials provide a novel pathway for catalyst preparation. The high surface area, high pore volume, and uniform pore size of mesoporous supports are very beneficial for the dispersion of active metals. Ordered mesoporous silicas, such as MCM-41, SBA-15, and ZSM-5, are an important series of mesoporous materials used for catalysts. Frontera et al. [82] studied the differences among highly ordered Silicalite-1, MCM-41, and zeolite ITQ-6 as supports for Ni-based catalysts. Ni/ITQ-6 showed a higher catalytic activity and less carbon formation after a 10 h reaction at 700 °C (77% CH4, 2.1% C) compared to Ni/MCM-41 (75% CH4, 4.4% C) and Ni/Silicalite-1 (63% CH4, 6.0% C). ITQ-6 permitted the highest dispersion of very small nickel particles (<20 nm) and prevented the metal particles from sintering. Bipul Sarkar et al. [93] reported Ni supported on mesoporous ZSM-15, which maintained thermal stability at 900 °C. This catalyst showed very high activity with 96.2% CH4 conversion at 800 °C, superior to Ni/SiO2-Al2O3 (62.1% CH4) and Ni/HZSM-5 (68.9% CH4). In addition to ordered mesoporous silica, other mesoporous materials have also been studied. For example, Sokolov et al. [86] compared nonstructured, mesoporous, and macroporous La2O3-ZrO2 in Ni-based catalysts. Fig. 5 shows the hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) profiles of different catalysts, which indicates that Ni was better dispersed on LaZr-meso than on LaZr-ns and LaZr-macro. During dry reforming at 400 °C, only Ni/LaZr-meso showed high stability over 180 h on-stream, whereas the other catalysts were deactivated. This was due to the stronger Ni-support interaction derived from the pore confinement effect. Mesoporous supports such as SBA-16, TUD-1, meso-Al2O3, and meso-ZrO2 have also been reported to demonstrate high catalytic activity and carbon resistance [94]. In general, mesostructured materials are promising as catalyst supports because they enable better control of metal migration upon reduction [95], providing a new perspective for catalyst design. Table 3 presents the performances of catalysts using different supports. 4.1.3 Catalyst promoters Promoters are frequently added to catalysts to improve their performance. They can improve stability by modifying catalyst structure, or they can enhance catalytic reactions [96]. They improve the dispersion of active metal species and also support the gasification of accumulated carbon [73]. Alkaline and earth metals are usually used as promoters. Jeong et al. [97] investigated the effects of Mg, Mn, K, and Ca on Ni/HY catalysts and found that the catalytic behavior decreased in the order of Ni-Mg/HY > Ni-Mn/HY > Ni-Ca/HY > Ni/HY > Ni-K/HY. As shown in Fig. 6 a, Mg induced the highest activity and stability, with a CH4 conversion of more than 85% without significant deactivation after a 72 h reaction. In Fig. 6b, Mg markedly decreased the intensity of the crystalline NiO peak at 2θ = 44.3°, which indicates smaller NiO particle size and higher dispersion of Ni on the catalyst, which led to better catalytic activity. By contrast, the Ni-K/HY catalyst experienced severe deactivation and decreased catalytic activity, which seems to contradict the report of Juan et al. [98], in which K-promoted Ni/Al2O3 catalysts had better catalytic behavior and stability. Some studies have reported that K can improve the reducibility of Ni species without changing the structure and size of Ni particles [2], whereas the migration of K from the support to the Ni surface decreases CH4 conversion because a fraction of the most active sites for dry reforming reactions are neutralized [99]. Ballarini et al. [100] investigated the promotion effects of Na, K, and Mg for Pt/Al2O3 catalysts with low metal loadings (0.02, 0.1, and 0.5 wt%) and found that the ratio of promoter to active metal was crucial. For 0.02% Pt/Al2O3 and 0.1% Pt/Al2O3, Mg-doped catalysts showed better catalytic performance than Na and K. However, as Pt content increased to 0.5%, K-doped catalysts showed higher conversion and selectivity than Mg and Na. Rare earth metals have been studied as catalyst promoters, and exhibit good promotion effects. Shi et al. [101] studied nanostructured Pd/Al2O3 catalysts promoted by K, Ca, Y, Mn, and Cu. They found that Y-modified Pd/Al2O3 showed the highest activity and stability, with CH4 conversion of more than 90% at 700 °C and almost no activity loss in 20 h of reaction. This is due to the uniform distribution of Pd particles, and thus sintering is suppressed. Amin et al. [102] investigated the influence of ytterbium (Yb) on Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. They found that low quantities of Yb (1–2 wt%) markedly increased the catalytic activity and stability, but higher quantities of Yb (3–8 wt%) did not achieve similar enhancement due to the blockage of active sites by excess amounts of deposited carbon. The 2 wt% Yb-doped catalyst had the smallest Ni particle size, narrowest particle size distribution, and best reducibility, for superior catalytic performance. Similar conclusions were drawn by Oemar et al. [103]. They prepared La-promoted Ni/SBA-15 catalysts with different La contents and found that a small amount of 1 wt% La was best for catalytic activity, whereas larger amounts of 5 wt% did not show good promotion effects. Al-Fatesh et al. [104] used Mg, La, and Sc to modify Co-Ni/SBA-15 catalysts. At 700 °C, adding Mg and Sc enhanced the CH4 conversion by 28% and 26%, respectively, compared to unpromoted catalyst, which may be attributed to the increased surface area and reducibility. As temperatures increased to 750 and 800 °C, the Sc-promoted catalyst achieved prominently higher catalytic activity than Mg-promoted catalyst, and showed high resistance to deactivation during a 50 h reaction. Vanadium (V) has been used as a promoter to improve catalytic behavior and reduce carbon deposition. Valentini et al. [105] reported that adding V to Ni/Al2O3 catalyst limited the formation of inactive phase NiAl2O4 and changed the microstructure by hindering the formation of aluminate spinel phase on catalyst, leading to a higher catalytic activity. Yu et al. [106] explored the effects of Ag as a promoter for Ni/CeO2 catalysts. Ag significantly reduced the activity of Ni surfaces due to increased activation energy, but improved long-term stability. Ag played the role of inhibiting coke nucleation and growth into whisker or graphitic carbon, and promoting the gasification of deposited coke on the catalyst surface. Interestingly, non-metal elements also function as promoters. Most recently, Park et al. [107] prepared phosphorous-modified γ-Al2O3 with different P contents (1–4 wt%) by an impregnation method using H3PO4 solution, and loaded 5 wt% Co onto this support. The addition of P caused the formation of AlPO4 phase on the catalyst surface, which inhibited the phase transformation of metallic Co to oxidized Co and inactive CoAl2O4 phase, leading to more stable catalytic activity compared to non-promoted catalyst. Table 4 presents the performances of catalysts using different promoters. In general, promoters enhance catalytic performance and stability by improving metal dispersion, reducibility, and metal-support interaction. It is important to choose both the proper species and amount when applying promoters to catalysts. 4.1.4 Synthesis method Synthesis methods greatly impact the physicochemical properties and activity of catalysts [112]. They play a crucial role in controlling the size of metal particles and modifying metal-support interactions [113]. When choosing a proper method for catalyst preparation, it is necessary to consider both the required catalyst components and the quality of the materials. The most common synthesis methods include impregnation, co-precipitation, and the sol-gel method. Impregnation (incipient/wet) is widely used in catalyst synthesis. It depends on the capillary pressure derived from contact between solid and liquid phases, and also the adsorption of active species onto a support. This method has several advantages. For example, it is relatively easy to operate compared to other methods. It also allows some control over metal distribution on the support [73]. However, only low weight loadings can be achieved via this method, and the interactions between metal and support are weak [114]. In the co-precipitation method, the active metals in solution are precipitated with the assistance of a precipitating agent. Wang et al. [115] claimed that the co-precipitation process influences the interactions between metal oxides, leading to lower activity and stability of the Ni/MgO catalyst compared to catalysts prepared via impregnated and sol-gel methods. The precipitating agent may decrease the activity of catalysts; therefore, the co-precipitating method is not usually preferred. However, a recent study by Gurav et al. [116] investigated the influence of preparation methods (co-precipitation, citrate gel, and incipient wetness impregnation) on Ni catalysts supported on Gd-doped ceria and found that the catalytic activity showed a trend of co-precipitation > citrate gel > impregnation. The average Ni crystallite sizes follow the reverse order, showing that smaller particles result in better activity. In the sol-gel method, precursors are dissolved in solution and monomers are converted into a colloidal solution via hydrolysis and condensation reactions. The sol-gel method helps improve thermal stability and resistance to deactivation, and is also beneficial for controlling the particle size, surface area, and pore size distribution of catalysts [117]. Sharifi et al. [118] compared impregnation and sol-gel methods for Co- and Cu-promoted Ni/Al2O3-ZrO2 catalyst preparation and reported that the sol-gel-prepared catalysts showed better activity. This was due to the uniform particle size distribution, increased surface area, and high dispersion of active metals. Higher vibration of the –OH functional group was also observed on the surface of sol-gel-prepared catalysts than those prepared by impregnation, which increased their alkaline properties. In addition to the traditional methods, newly developed technologies such as combustion, hydrothermal, and microemulsion have also been utilized. Naeem et al. [119] synthesized two series of Ni-based nanocatalysts for biogas dry reforming by polyol and surfactant-assisted methods. The polyol catalyst was synthesized in ethylene glycol (EG) medium, and the surfactant-assisted catalyst was prepared using CTAB as a surfactant. The polyol catalyst showed higher activity and selectivity, whereas the surfactant-assisted catalyst showed higher carbon resistance, which was related to higher basicity. The authors concluded that both the polyol and surfactant-assisted methods are promising for catalyst preparation. Gonzalez-Delacruz et al. [120] prepared Ni/CeO2 catalysts via the combustion method. In this process, metal precursors and citric acid as fuel were evaporated, and then an auto-ignited explosive reaction occurred [121]. The combustion method resulted in narrow particle size distribution and good dispersion of active species, with the advantages of simplicity and low cost for large scale production [120]. Zhang et al. [122] synthesized Ni/MgO-Al2O3 catalysts via a two-step hydrothermal method by which the Ni(OH)2 nanoparticles formed in the first step took part in the secondary hydrothermal reaction. The obtained catalyst had a sheet-like structure which showed good activity and stability at high GHSV (6 × 105 cm3 gcat −1 h−1) and low temperature (650 °C). Shiraz et al. [123] prepared mesoporous nanocrystalline γ-Al2O3 using the microemulsion method as the support for Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. They reported that a microemulsion consisting of water, cyclohexane, CTAB, and ethanol improved the textual properties of alumina, thus enhancing the catalytic performance. Gálvez et al. [124] synthesized Ni/SBA-15 catalysts and modified the precipitation method by adding ascorbic acid as a chemical reducing agent. Catalysts prepared by this method showed better catalytic activity and stability compared to traditional impregnation and precipitation, due to the confinement of both NiO and Ni-phyllosilicate species inside the support. Deactivation was inhibited in this catalyst because it favored the formation of amorphous rather than crystalline carbon. Ewbank et al. [114] used controlled adsorption and dry impregnation methods to prepare Co/Al2O3 catalysts for biogas dry reforming. Compared to impregnation, controlled adsorption led to smaller particle sizes and higher dispersion of Co, which in turn caused higher conversion of CH4 and CO2. Controlled adsorption produced more non-deactivating carbon deposits, whereas dry impregnation more easily produced deactivating carbon and caused serious decreases in activity. In recent years, non-thermal plasma technology has received great interest as a novel treatment. Rahemi et al. conducted a series of studies on non-thermal plasma treatment for dry reforming catalyst preparation. They synthesized Ni/Al2O3 and Ni/Al2O3–ZrO2 catalysts via impregnation and plasma treatment, labeled NA-I, NA-P, NAZ-I, and NAZ-P, respectively [125]. The NAZ-P catalyst showed higher catalytic activity (CH4 and CO2 conversion almost 98% at 850 °C, GHSV 24–60 L/g h) than the NA-P and NAZ-I catalysts. This was due to the smaller particle size (18.5 nm) and higher dispersion of active phase NiO in NAZ-P compared to the obvious agglomeration found in NAZ-I (see Fig. 7 a and c). They also showed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) results that the interactions between the metal and the support were stronger in NAZ-P. Most recently, they investigated the influence of voltage (700, 1000, and 1300 V) on Ni-Co/Al2O3–ZrO2 catalytic properties, and suggested that 1000 V was the optimum voltage, showing a high feed conversion of 99% at 850 °C [126]. The 1000 V-treated catalyst formed amorphous structures for NiO that promoted the dispersion of the active phase. In addition, they also investigated the influence of plasma treatment on Ni-Co/Al2O3 [127], Ni-Cu/Al2O3 [128], Ni/Al2O3-CeO2 [129], and Ni-Cu/Al2O3–ZrO2 [130] catalysts, further supporting that plasma treatment is a very promising method for catalyst preparation. plasma could increase the syngas generation rate by promoting the surface structure of catalysts and extending the lifetime of electron-hole pairs [200]. However, plasma treatment has the disadvantages of high energy consumption and the requirement for expensive equipment [54], which makes it difficult to apply in large-scale industry. 4.1.5 Solid waste-derived catalysts This is a newly developed environmentally friendly concept aimed at simultaneous utilization of solid waste and biogas to obtain high added value. Chamoumi et al. [131] designed a new Ni-based catalyst with support derived from an ilmenite metallurgical residue consisting of an upgraded slag oxide (UGSO) via an improved solid-state reaction. The Ni/UGSO catalyst exhibited a higher CH4 conversion of 87% at 810 °C and maintained stability in a 4 h reaction, compared to raw UGSO (CH4 conversion 30%) and a conventional NiFe2O4 catalyst (CH4 conversion 39%) [132]. The Ni/UGSO catalyst also showed a product H2/CO ratio close to unity, and little carbon deposition. The high catalytic activity and carbon resistance were due to various components in USGO, including basic oxides such as CaO, MgO, and MnO, which had strong interactions with Ni and played the role of promoters. Kanamori et al. [133] conducted research on the recovery of rare metal compounds from nickel metal hydride battery waste for catalyst preparation. NiO, CeO2, and LaCoO3 were separated using HCl, NaOH, and NH3 solutions, and were applied for biogas dry reforming. They all exhibited catalytic activity; notably, the separated NiO showed excellent CH4 conversion of nearly 100% for 24 h. Bermudez et al. [134] used a mixture of steel slag and carbon materials (activated carbon and metallurgical char) as catalysts for microwave-assisted biogas dry reforming. Carbon material was necessary to increase the reactivity towards microwave, and steel slag provided active metals for the catalyst. The authors claimed that activated carbon yielded higher CH4 and CO2 conversion than metallurgical char when mixed with steel slag. Cheng et al. [135] synthesized Ni and Co catalysts using empty fruit bunch (EFB) clinker as support via the wet-impregnation method. Both the Ni and Co catalysts showed a CH4 conversion of 80% at 900 °C. XRD and XRF results identified the existence of CaO and K2O species in EFB clinker that enhanced the dispersion of active metals and reduced carbon deposit. Chen et al. [136] used SiO2 synthesized from photovoltaic waste via the vapor-phase hydrolysis technique as a support for a Ni-based catalyst. This catalyst showed high activity, with CH4 and CO2 conversions of 92.3 and 95.8%, respectively, at 800 °C without deactivation after a 40 h reaction, which was competitive with commercial precipitated SiO2 and ordered mesoporous SiO2. In fact, ordered mesoporous SiO2, which is usually used as the support for catalysts, can also be synthesized from other solid waste such as coal fly ash [137]. These studies provide new approaches for obtaining high added value from solid waste and reducing the cost of catalyst preparation."
8,Operating conditions,"4.2 Operating conditions 4.2.1 Reaction temperature and pressure As mentioned, biogas dry reforming is an endothermic reaction. Therefore, in general, higher temperatures promote the reaction toward syngas formation and improve the conversion of CH4 and CO2. This has been confirmed by Chein et al. [138], who investigated the thermodynamics of biogas dry reforming under different temperatures and pressures via the Gibbs free energy minimization method. As shown in Fig. 8 , when other conditions were kept the same, the conversion of CH4 increased with increasing temperature, and the H2 yield showed a similar trend. In contrast, carbon formation per unit CH4 fed decreased as the temperature increased, because high temperatures hinder exothermic reactions, including the Boudouard reaction and CO2 and CO hydrogenation (Eqs. (8)–(10)). The H2/CO ratio decreased as temperature increased because high temperatures promote the endothermic RWGS reaction, in which H2 is consumed to produce CO. As for the effects of pressure, the conversion of CH4 and yield of H2 decreased as the pressure increased from 1 bar to 30 bar, which suggests that high pressure was not suitable for biogas dry reforming. Similarly, Nikoo et al. [139] reported that temperatures above 700 °C suppressed carbon formation, whereas decreased reaction conversion and increased carbon deposition were observed when the pressure increased from 1 atm to 25 atm, owing to the methane decomposition and CO disproportionation reactions. Although high temperature is believed to improve the conversion of CH4 and CO2, many researchers are seeking new pathways to reduce the high energy consumption derived from high temperatures. Low-temperature (under 700 °C) biogas dry reforming has attracted much attention. Galvez et al. [124] prepared an effective Ni/SBA-15 catalyst via an unconventional method using ascorbic acid as a reducing agent, and reported good conversion results of 65% CH4 and 88% CO2 at 600 °C. Kaydouh et al. [77] synthesized Ce-Ni/SBA-15 (Ni first impregnated) and Ni-Ce/SBA-15 (Ce first impregnated) catalysts via a two-solvent technique and compared their catalytic activities. Ni/SBA-15 and Ce/SBA-15 catalysts were also prepared as references. All four catalysts showed CH4 and CO2 conversion of around or above 80% at a relatively low temperature of 600 °C, superior to the results from other studies. The Ni-Ce/SBA-15 catalyst presented the best activity, with 100% CH4 conversion and 90% CO2 conversion at approximately 600 °C. This excellent catalytic performance was attributed to the two-solvent synthesis method, which promoted the dispersion and stabilization of the active phase inside the channels and thus formed very small NiO particles. The dilution conditions and the role of the SBA-15 support as a membrane may have also affected catalytic performance, and further research is needed to clarify this [77]. In addition, an electric field is usually used in low-temperature dry reforming. Yabe et al. [140] conducted a dry reforming reaction using a 1 wt% Ni/La-ZrO2 catalyst in an electric field. When a current of 3.0 mA was applied, a high reaction conversion of 77.2% CH4 and 87.6% CO2 was achieved after 140 min of reaction even at a low external temperature of 150 °C, which had advantages over the conventional reaction at 750 °C (64.0% CH4 and 77.0% CO2). The amount of carbon deposition on catalysts in the electric field (1.5 mg/gcat) was much less than that in conventional reactions (>39.6 mg/gcat). The electric field was presumed to play the role of activating CH4 and formate species and promoting surface reactions. However, there are still many challenges for low-temperature dry reforming. Further research focusing on the structure of active phases at the atomic level is needed, as well as detailed kinetic and mechanistic studies [141]. 4.2.2 Calcination temperature Calcination temperature has an important influence on the particle size of active metals and the textual properties of catalysts [142,143], thus affecting the catalytic performance of catalysts. Therefore, it is necessary to choose a proper calcination temperature to achieve high catalytic activity and low carbon deposition. Chen et al. [143] investigated the influence of calcination temperature (300–750 °C) on Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. Higher catalytic activity was observed at 300–450 °C than at 600–750 °C because high calcination temperatures lead to the coalescence of NiO and the formation of segregated NiAl2O4 spinel. In addition, the surface area decreased as calcination temperatures increased from 300 °C to 750 °C, corresponding to other studies [144,145]. Serrano-Lotina et al. [146] studied the effects of calcination temperature (250–750 °C) on biogas dry reforming activity and the stability of La-NiMgAl catalysts. The XRD results showed that calcination temperatures higher than 250 °C led to the loss of hydrotalcite structure and the formation of metal oxide solid solutions. The grain size and cell parameter value increased as calcination temperature increased. As for catalytic activity, a trend of 550 °C > 650 °C > 750 °C > 450 °C > 350 °C > 250 °C was observed, whereas greater stability was observed at 350 °C and 650 °C. Yu et al. [147] studied the influence of calcination temperature (500–900 °C) on CaO-promoted Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. The best catalytic activity was observed for catalysts calcinated at 800 °C, whereas the catalysts calcinated at 600 °C exhibited the worst activity. Apart from calcination temperature, calcination ambience also greatly affects catalyst behavior. Sokolov et al. [148] investigated the influence of both calcination temperature (250–800 °C) and atmosphere (Ar and air) on Ni/La2O3–ZrO2 catalysts during low-temperature (400 °C) dry reforming. As calcination temperature increased, the dispersion of Ni decreased and larger Ni particles formed. However, higher catalytic activity was observed over the larger Ni particles, which contradicted the traditional conclusions. They proposed that at a low reaction temperature of 400 °C, the reaction of CO2 with carbon species served as the rate-limiting step, rather than CH4 activation. As for calcination atmosphere, Ar led to smaller Ni particles and better stability compared to air. Zhu et al. [149] investigated the effects of different calcination ambience (Ar, CO2, O2, and H2) on Ni-Ce/SiO2 catalysts. The catalytic activity showed a trend of Ni-Ce-Ar > Ni-Ce-O2 > Ni-Ce-CO2 > Ni-Ce-H2. The XRD and TPR results revealed that both Ni dispersion and metal-support interactions were better in Ni-Ce-Ar catalysts than in the others. The Ni-Ce-Ar catalyst also showed the greatest stability, as the main carbon deposited on it was reaction carbon, which was due to the enhanced mobility and activity of surface oxygen species. By contrast, inert carbon was the main species on the Ni-Ce-H2 catalyst, leading to its poor stability. Table 5 shows the influence of calcination temperature on catalyst performance. In general, calcination temperature does have an important influence on catalytic activity and stability by affecting the particle size and textual structure of catalysts. However, from the studies discussed above, the proper calcination temperature is not fixed but varies for different types of catalysts, depending on the properties of active metals and supports. 4.2.3 Reduction conditions Reduction is a necessary pretreatment step to convert metal oxides into metallic species before the biogas dry reforming reaction. Similar to calcination, both reduction temperature and atmosphere have significant effects on catalytic behavior. Pino et al. [150] investigated the effects of reduction temperature (450–900 °C) on a Ni/La2O3-CeO2 catalyst prepared via the combustion method. TPO experimental results showed that the catalyst reduced at 450 °C produced a great deal of carbon deposition (>20%) during the reaction, whereas the catalysts reduced at 750 °C and 900 °C produced little carbon (<1%), which was confirmed by the SEM images shown in Fig. 9 . This carbon resistance was explained by a good balance between Ni reduction degree and metal-support interactions. During 50 h of biogas dry reforming reaction, higher initial CH4 conversion was observed over the catalyst reduced at 450 °C, but the catalysts reduced at 750 °C and 900 °C showed greater stability. They also found that the catalytic activity increased with increased Ni particle size, similar to Sokolov’s conclusion [148], and raised two assumptions: that higher reduction temperatures modified the morphology of Ni particles, and that the reaction followed a bi-functional mechanism. However, Usman and Daud [151] investigated the effects of reduction temperature (550 °C and 800 °C) on a Ni/MgO catalyst and found that higher reduction temperatures resulted in severe deactivation due to sintering. Horvath et al. [152] investigated the influence of reduction temperature (500–900 °C) on Co/Al2O3 catalyst. TPR and XRS results showed that Co was only partially reduced, and higher reduction temperatures led to a larger extent of reduction and more structured metallic Co. The highest CH4 conversion was observed at 700 °C. It has also been reported that reduction temperature affects the type of carbon, and low temperatures result in adventitious carbon whereas high temperatures result in carbidic carbon. Yao et al. [153] studied the effects of reduction temperature (400–800 °C) on a ZrOx/Ni-MnOx/SiO2 catalyst used in low-temperature biogas dry reforming. The catalyst reduced at 550 °C exhibited a higher content of surface Ni, smaller particles, and narrower particle size distribution, as well as the highest catalytic activity. Liu et al. [154] studied the effects of different reduction atmospheres (H2, CH4, CO, and He) on a Ni/ZrO2-SiO2 catalyst. The catalyst was pretreated at 750 °C for 2 h. They reported that H2 reduction yielded the best catalytic activity at a low reaction temperature (<500 °C), whereas for temperatures higher than 550 °C, the activity showed the trend of He > H2 > CH4 > CO. The catalyst pretreated with He exhibited a high CH4 conversion of 90% at a reaction temperature of 800 °C. The graphite peak revealed that little carbon deposition formed on catalysts reduced by H2, whereas catalysts treated with CH4 produced large amounts of carbon, which corresponded to the thermogravimetric weight loss of H2 (2.6%) < He (5.5%) < CO (6.4%) < CH4 (36.6%). The XRD and TEM results showed that catalyst reduced by H2 had the smallest metal crystalline size, followed by He, CH4, and CO. Apart from pure gases, mixed gases such as H2-N2, H2-He and H2-Ar with different compositions were applied more widely in reduction before biogas dry reforming. Based on a comparison of a series of studies on Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, catalysts reduced in H2-N2 [155] or H2-Ar [156] atmosphere showed greater catalytic activity and stability than those reduced in pure H2 [157] or H2-He [158] under similar reaction conditions. This result has also been reported over Ni/ZrO2, Ni/MgO-ZrO2, and Ni/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 catalysts [54]. Therefore, mixed reducing agents should be given priority in reduction to achieve better catalytic behavior. Table 6 demonstrates the influence of reduction condition on catalytic activity. 4.2.4 Gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) The influence of GHSV is usually a concern in studies of biogas dry reforming, as it is a significant operating parameter affecting catalytic performance. Generally, higher GHSV decreases catalytic activity because the contact time of gas and solid phases becomes shorter, thus many reactants remain unreacted after flowing across the catalyst [159–161]. Higher GHSV leads to higher external diffusion resistance, which blocks the diffusion of reactant molecules into the pores of catalysts [162]. A Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst exhibited severe deactivation at high GHSV owing to the formation of Ni2+-containing inactive phases [62]. The inhibition effects of increasing GHSV on a Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was also reported by Karemore et al. [163]. Akbari et al. [59] investigated the influence of GHSV on a Ni/MgO-Al2O3 catalyst at 700 °C and found that reactant conversion decreased as GHSV increased from 4500 mL/h g to 18000 mL/h g, which was due to the decrease in contact time and amount of adsorbed reactants on the catalyst surface. A drastic decline in catalytic activity was also observed in a study by Pino et al. [150] on Ce0.70La0.20Ni0.10O2-δ catalyst as GHSV increased from 26,400 to 105,600 h-1. Severe deactivation occurred at high GHSV resulting from carbon deposition, which was similar for Ru/ZnLaAlO4, Pt/ZnLaAlO4, and Ni/ZnLaAlO4 catalysts [56]. From the perspective of industrial applications, suitable catalysts demonstrating good activity even at high GHSV are needed to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of biogas dry reforming, which means more reactants can be converted into products with a certain amount of catalyst. Rahemi et al. [125] studied the influence of GHSV (24–60 L/h g) on Ni/Al2O3-ZrO2 catalysts prepared via impregnation and non-thermal plasma. For the impregnation catalyst, reactant conversion decreased as GHSV increased due to the great mass transfer limitation, which inhibited the interactions of Ni with CH4 and CO2. However, for the catalyst treated with plasma, GHSV had little effect on activity, with high CH4 and CO2 conversion of 98% under all GHSVs. In another study by Rahemi et al. [128] using Ni-Cu/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by the same methods of impregnation and non-thermal plasma, both catalysts showed lower activity when GHSV increased, but the reduction in activity of catalysts treated with plasma was less evident due to the surface enrichment of active phase species derived from plasma. The influence of GHSV on catalytic activity is presented in Table 7 . These results provide an enlightening pathway for synthesizing catalysts adaptive for high GHSVs. Nevertheless, to design efficient and stable catalysts for industrial use at high GHSVs, more research on the intrinsic kinetics and mechanisms is required. 4.2.5 Reactors Continuous fixed bed reactors (FBRs) are widely used for biogas dry reforming as well as many other catalytic reactions, owing to their relatively simple structure and low cost. Fluidized bed reactors (FIBRs) have also been applied in some studies of dry reforming. Tomishige et al. [166] compared the two types of reactors and found that the Ni0.15Mg0.85O catalyst showed better activity in the latter, owing to inhibition of carbon deposition. Good catalytic performance has also been reported by Agrawal and Srivastava [167], who conducted a model simulation on biogas dry reforming and obtained a high CH4 conversion rate of 97.64% at 800 °C. However, these reactors have poor thermochemical and thermomechanical durability, and thus a large quantity of catalyst and high reaction temperatures are required [168]. Hence, there is increasing interest in developing new reactors. Membrane reactors that couple H2 production and separation in one step have been the subjects of many studies. Sumrunronnasak et al. [169] investigated the catalytic performance of a Pd76Ag19Cu5 alloy membrane reactor packed with 5% Ni/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 catalyst and found that the conversion of CH4 and CO2 increased significantly compared to a traditional reactor. This was attributed to the H2 separation by the membrane, which helped shift the reaction equilibrium forward and inhibited the competing WGS reaction. Garcia-Garcia et al. [170] compared the catalytic behavior of a newly designed hollow fiber membrane reactor (HFMR) to a tubular membrane reactor (TMR) and a conventional FBR. The HFMR was composed of a packed catalyst bed around a Pd-coated Al2O3 hollow fiber membrane, as shown in Fig. 10 . The CH4 conversion in the HFMR was 72% higher than that in the FBR, and 34% higher than thermodynamic equilibrium. The HFMR exhibited a similar reactant conversion to the TMR, but the amount of Pd required was 15 times less than in the TMR. This was due to the higher surface area to volume ratio of asymmetric ceramic hollow fiber, which made the utilization of Pd in the membrane more efficient, thus greatly improving the economy of the reaction. Moreover, highly pure H2 gas free from COx can be achieved using HFMR. In a recent study by Liang et al. [171], a novel BaFe0.9Zr0.05Al0.05O3-δ membrane reactor was used to investigate simultaneous N2O (another greenhouse gas) decomposition and syngas production (see Fig. 11 ). Both a high CH4 conversion of 97% and nearly complete N2O conversion were achieved at 900 °C, with good stability and no obvious decreases in activity and selectivity observed after 100 h of reaction. Microreactors are usually used in multiphase reactions because of their extremely large surface to volume ratio and excellent mass and heat transfer performance [172]. Al-fatesh et al. [111] used a fixed-bed microreactor to investigate the dry reforming of model biogas over Ce- and Ca-promoted Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. High conversions of CH4 (94.1%) and CO2 (98.3%) were obtained at 850 °C, with negligible carbon deposition and good stability. Microreactors are reported to have superior conversion rates [173] compared to tubular FBRs [174], but there are also problems with microreactors, such as reactor blockage [54]. Solar thermal flow reactors for dry reforming have been studied in recent years. In these reactors, concentrated solar energy is used as the energy source for high-temperature reactions [175]. Mahmodi et al. [176] investigated the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 and CH4 using an immobilized ZnO semiconductor on stainless steel mesh in a photocatalytic reactor, in which UV illumination served as the energy source. The conversion of CH4 and CO2 reached 15.83% and 12.35%, respectively, at room temperature. Dahl et al. [177] investigated dry reforming using a solar thermal aerosol flow reactor without any added catalysts. A temperature of 2000 K was achieved within an operation time of 10 ms, at which the conversion of CH4 and CO2 were 70% and 65%, respectively. This provided a new pathway for dry reforming in the absence of catalysts, thus avoiding the problems discussed above, such as deactivation and carbon deposition. However, challenges still remain. The stable operation of dry reforming requires continuous supplication and effective storage of solar energy, which are difficult tasks on a large scale, considering the effects of overcast days [178]."
9,Influence of impurities in biogas,"4.3 Influence of impurities in biogas 4.3.1 H2S Apart from the properties of catalysts and reaction conditions, impurities in biogas also greatly influence catalytic activity and stability. Sulfur in biogas predominately exists in the form of H2S [179]. H2S is a major impurity in biogas that can lead to catalyst poisoning even at very low concentrations, as well as equipment corrosion. Chattanathan et al. [180] investigated the effects of H2S (0.5–1.5 mol%) on biogas dry reforming and found that the introduction of H2S drastically decreased CH4 and CO2 conversion, mainly attributable to the sulfur deposition reaction. Mancino et al. [181] studied the effects of H2S and SO2 (1–30 ppm) on a Rh/γ-Al2O3 catalyst during biogas dry reforming. Even at a low concentration of 1 ppm, sulfur severely poisoned the catalyst, and the poisoning reached saturation at contents higher than 10 ppm regardless of the type of S-bearing compounds. Transient poisoning experiments revealed the mechanism: sulfur was directly binding to Rh active sites to compete with CH4. Once Rh atoms were free from sulfur, they could still activate CH4 molecules. Therefore, the poisoning was reversible, and the catalyst was regenerated by removing sulfur from the feed gas for a long period of time. However, for Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts [182], removing sulfur from feed gas led to slow recovery of activity only at a high reaction temperature of 800 °C and was ineffective at 700 °C, likely due to the kinetic unfavorability of H2S desorption at lower temperatures. As for the NiAl2O4/Al2O3-YSZ catalyst [183], stopping the H2S feed only partially recovered the catalyst. Calcination at 900 °C was required to achieve full recovery. For the Ni/SiO2 catalyst, Chen et al. [184] reported that deactivation was not reversible simply through H2S feed cessation or temperature-programmed calcination, but O2 activation completely regenerated the catalyst. This suggests that regeneration methods depend on the composition of catalysts. In addition, the authors revealed that the mechanism of H2S poisoning and regeneration was the formation and elimination of the Ni7S6 phase (see Fig. 12 ), which was detected for the first time via XRD and XPS methods. To maintain catalytic performance in biogas dry reforming in the presence of sulfur, sulfur-resistant catalysts have been developed and studied. Gaillard et al. [185] prepared a novel Mo/γ-Al2O3 catalyst using the incipient wetness impregnation method and tested its sulfur tolerance during catalytic reaction. In the presence of 50 ppm H2S, rapid deactivation occurred on the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, whereas the Mo/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited good sulfur resistance, as only a small amount of sulfur was absorbed. Moreover, the bimetallic Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst showed greater stability than the two monometallic catalysts in the presence of H2S due to the spillover effects of Ni on Mo. Ocsachoque et al. [186] investigated the sulfur deactivation of Ni/CeO2 and Rh/CeO2 catalysts during dry reforming using both experiments and theoretical calculations. They found that the sulfur tolerance of Rh/CeO2 was higher than that of Ni/CeO2. This was due to the high oxygen donation capacity of Rh/CeO2, which promoted the reduction of CeO2. Using Raman spectroscopy they showed that the O2− species on Rh/CeO2 favored sulfur removal from the support in the form of SO2 and inhibited Rh-S interactions, thus decreasing sulfur poisoning. Misture et al. [187] prepared microcrystalline spinel-supported Ni, Ni-Co, and Ni-Cu catalysts with highly faceted oxides (Fig. 13 ) using the solid state method at high temperatures (1200–1600 °C). Higher crystal perfection and faceting increased sulfur tolerance, and the Ni/Co ratio also had a critical effect on sulfur resistance. The formation of {1 1 1} facets may increase oxygen transfer, which facilitates the oxidative removal of sulfur. Regeneration was reported to greatly improve catalytic activity and stability. After regeneration, the Co0.375Ni0.375Mg0.25Al2O4 catalyst showed 94% CH4 conversion with the presence of 20 ppm H2S, and remained stable for 12 h. In general, these studies opened new routes for the development of sulfur-resistant catalysts. However, further research is still needed to develop effective sulfur-resistant catalysts with different supports and promoters, and to elucidate the underlying mechanism of sulfur–catalyst interactions. 4.3.2 O2 Generally, O2 is introduced into biogas from the air when biogas is collected and when ventilation is switched on to remove sulfide [6]. The introduced O2 is expected to take part in the partial oxidative reforming reaction as shown in Eq. (4). Chen et al. [188] studied the partial oxidative reforming of biogas at different ratios of O2/CH4 (0.4–0.7) and CO2/O2 (0–2). They found that CH4 conversion greatly depended on the O2/CH4 ratio but was insensitive to the CO2/O2 ratio. An O2/CH4 ratio of 0.6 was recommended, as it yielded higher CH4 conversion, syngas production, CO2 consumption, and system energy efficiency. Lucrédio et al. [189] studied dry reforming over Ni/γ-Al2O3 and Ni/MgO catalysts in feed gas with a CH4:CO2:O2 ratio of 1.5:1:0.25, and reported that the presence of O2 favored the oxidation of carbon into CO (Eq. (10)). Chein et al. [138] investigated the effects of O2 addition (O2:CH4 ratio 0:2) at a high pressure of 20 bar. A higher O2/CH4 ratio increased CH4 conversion, but excessive O2 decreased the H2 yield owing to methane combustion (Eq. (11)). (10) C s + 1 2 O 2 ↔ CO , Δ H ∘ = - 110 kJ / mol (11) CH4 + 2O2 ↔ CO2 + 2H2O, ΔHo = −803 kJ/mol However, the O2 content in real biogas is usually under 5%. Therefore, the effects of lower O2 content require further study. Recently, Chen et al. [190] investigated the effects of O2 (0–15%) on a Ni/SiO2 catalyst during biogas dry reforming. They found that the presence of O2 improved the catalytic activity and stability. This improvement was first attributed to the ability of O2 to inhibit sintering, likely by changing the reducing environment in which small Ni particles were unstable towards sintering. The second reason was that O2 decreases carbon deposition by increasing carbon activity. An O2 content of less than 5% is recommended for efficient biogas dry reforming and hydrogen production, as higher concentrations of O2 (≥10%) severely decrease CO2 conversion and increase H2O production via the reaction in Eq. (11). 4.3.3 Siloxanes Volatile methyl siloxanes, referred to here as siloxanes, are a class of organic silicon compounds in which silicon atoms are alternately connected to oxygen atoms and hydrocarbon functional groups [17], with linear or cyclic molecular structures. They are usually found in cosmetics, detergents, and building materials [6]. Biogas, particularly landfill gas, is often contaminated by siloxanes. Siloxanes can decompose and form SiO2 with O2 at high temperatures, which remains on the surfaces of machines and damages equipment [6]. It has also been reported that siloxanes greatly decrease the efficiency of energy recovery from biogas [191], and have poisoning effects on steam reforming catalysts [192]. Therefore, it is necessary to effectively remove siloxanes before utilizing biogas. Several technologies have been developed for siloxane removal via adsorbents such as activated carbon powder [193] and 13X zeolites [194], or via silicone-rubber membranes [195]. However, very little research has focused on the influence of siloxanes on dry reforming catalysts. Recently, Elsayed et al. [196] studied the poisoning effects of siloxanes on biogas dry reforming. Silica was coated on a Ni-Mg/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst to simulate the silica accumulation of 1 week, 1 month, and 6 months caused by siloxanes. Silica had adverse effects on catalysts and led to their deactivation, even at small amounts. As the amount of silica increased, the conversion of CH4 and CO2 decreased. The interaction between siloxanes and catalysts and the mechanism of silica poisoning remain unclear and require further research. 4.3.4 Other impurities In addition to the impurities discussed above, there are other impurities in biogas such as H2O, N2, and chlorine, as listed in Table 2. H2O in biogas is expected to take part in the steam reforming reaction (Eq. (1)) and improve the conversion of CH4. Combined steam and dry reforming of methane has been extensively studied [56,197,198]. As for N2, the inert component in biogas, Chein et al. [138] reported that it had a positive effect on dry reforming by slightly increasing CH4 and CO2 conversion at a pressure of 20 bar. This was explained by equilibrium theory: adding N2 increased the total amount of reaction species, which acted as a pressure decrease and thus promoted the dry reforming reaction toward the positive direction. Nevertheless, because the concentrations of H2O and N2 in biogas are very low, their effects on biogas dry reforming can be considered negligible. Chlorocarbons, which are derived from chlorinated compounds in organic materials, have some poisoning effects on catalysts. Kohn et al. [199] investigated the effects of 10–50 ppm methyl chloride (CH3Cl) on biogas dry reforming over a Rh/γ-Al2O3 catalyst at temperatures from 350 °C to 700 °C. They confirmed that CH3Cl reacted with an Al2O3 support to produce surface chlorine, which increased the acidity of the support. This led to reversible poisoning of the reverse WGS reaction, thus altering the H2/CO ratio. The degree of chlorine poisoning increased with increasing CH3Cl concentration and decreasing temperature. As for other trace impurities such as NH3, benzene, and toluene, few studies have reported their influences on biogas dry reforming."
10,Conclusions and outlook,"Biogas is a valuable renewable energy resource. In this review, we briefly summarized the existing technologies for biogas purification and utilization. Among these technologies, dry reforming is a promising and competitive pathway because it converts the two major greenhouse gases in biogas, CH4 and CO2, into syngas. We discussed in detail recent developments and research on biogas dry reforming, including the preparation of catalysts, the optimization of operation conditions, and the influence of impurities in biogas. Bimetallic catalysts (Ni-noble metals, Ni-Co, Ni-Fe, and Ni-Cu) have become attractive owing to their high catalytic activity, although it is crucial to control their molar ratios. Catalysts with a core-shell structure have drawn much attention due to their advantageous physicochemical properties of preventing sintering and carbon deposition. In addition to single supports, many studies have focused on mixed supports to promote the behavior of catalysts. Mesoporous materials such as MCM-41 and SBA-15 perform well as support materials because they are beneficial for the dispersion of active metals. Mg and some rare earth elements (Y and Sc) are effective promoters for improving catalytic activity and stability. Plasma treatment is a very promising method for catalyst preparation that produces smaller particle sizes and higher dispersion of the active phase, but carries the challenge of high equipment costs. Solid waste-derived catalysts are being developed as a new approach for obtaining value-added solid waste and reducing the costs of catalyst preparation. Generally, catalysts perform better at higher reaction temperatures, lower pressures, and smaller GHSVs. The influence of calcination and reduction conditions depends on the composition and properties of catalysts. Several reactors have been studied in addition to conventional FBR and FIBR. Membrane reactors can combine H2 production and separation into a single step. Microreactors have excellent mass and heat transfer performance. Solar thermal flow reactors can be used without catalysts, thus sidestepping the problems of deactivation and carbon deposition, but the challenge for their large-scale application is the storage of solar energy. Impurities in biogas have significant effects on dry reforming. H2S and siloxanes can poison catalysts, and some studies have focused on the development of sulfur-resistant catalysts. Low O2 concentrations can inhibit sintering and decrease carbon deposition. Little research has been conducted on the influence of other impurities in biogas. Further research should focus on the development of bimetallic catalysts with high and stable activity, particularly the use of non-noble metals to reduce costs and fit industrial applications. Mesoporous materials are also promising and merit further research as catalyst supports, as they have advanced properties such as high surface area, high pore volume, and uniform pore size. From the perspective of new research frontiers, new catalysts such as core-shell structure materials should be given special attention. Moreover, the effects of various impurities in biogas on dry reforming require further study, including the inherit mechanism of H2S and siloxane poisoning and the development of poisoning-resistant catalysts. To date, almost all research on biogas dry reforming has used simulated biogas as feed gas. Future research should test dry reforming using real biogas, an important and necessary step to push this technology toward practical applications."
