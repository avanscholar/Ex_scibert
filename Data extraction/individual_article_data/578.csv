0,Introduction,"In the last years, we have witnessed a significant change in the identity of industrial chemistry with its inexorable transition from fossil to renewable feedstocks. To this regard, the worldwide attention is focusing on the use of lignocellulosic biomasses for the sustainable production of biofuels and bioderived chemicals [1–6]. The reason can be easily explained if we look at the chemical composition of the key components of biomasses (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) that have the potential for the sustainable production of several building block intermediates for modern biorefineries [7]. Cellulose and hemicellulose are mainly formed of C6- and C5-sugars, respectively, while lignin is mainly composed by phenolic units. Such a wealth of chemical functionalities represents, at present, the most promising alternative to petroleum resources [8–12]. Cellulose and hemicellulose are an important feedstock for the sustainable production of biobased building blocks since their relative polysaccharide fractions account for up to 70% of the total biomass composition. However, with respect to petroleum feeds, cellulose and hemicellulose fractions are characterized by a higher content of oxygen-functionality (e.g –OH, –COOH, –CO) which prevents their direct use in traditional refinery processes [7]. The catalytic valorization of C6 (cellulosic) and C5 (hemicellulosic) sugars were traditionally carried out after using well established and standardized physico-chemical pre-treatments that allow a complete separation of lignocellulose fractions [13]. Nonetheless, integrated reductive catalytic processes (the so called “lignin-first” biorefinery approach) for simultaneous depolymerization of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin fractions from lignocellulosic biomass are getting more and more attention [14]. Whatever the technological approach for the (pre)treatment of biomass is chosen, once cellulose and hemicellulose are deconstructed by acid or reductive catalyzed hydrolysis, glucose and xylose can be easily hydrogenated into the corresponding C6 and C5 polyols (sorbitol and xylitol, respectively) (Fig. 1 ) [15,16]. Biomass derived polyols are characterized by the presence of at least two hydroxyl groups and can be considered an important class of chemical compounds and intermediates with sorbitol (C6 polyols), xylitol (C5 polyols) and glycerol (C3 polyol) being included in the list of the 12 most promising bio-derived platform molecules [17,18]. C6–C2 polyols, including 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO), 1,2- and 1,3-propylene glycol (1,2-PDO and 1,3-PDO) and ethylene glycol (EG), are widely used as ingredient or additive in food (xylitol is the most used sweetener characterized by a lower calories content and reduced glycaemic index with respect to sucrose) pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry as well as cheap monomers for the manufacturing of polymers, coatings, adhesives, etc (sorbitol has been successfully used for years for the production of polyurethanes) [19]. EG, habitually adopted as antifreeze agent, is a key component in the production of bio-PET while other bio-based diols, besides their direct applications, are currently used as co-monomers in bio-elastomeric polymers [20]. Polyols are not directly suitable for classical refinery processes because of the high presence of oxygen. This “oxygen-overfunctionalization” makes polyols acidic and difficult to selectively convert into target compounds owing to their high reactivity. Therefore, modern catalytic technologies need an efficient reduction of the oxygen content in bio-polyols allowing the production of H2, fuels and added value compounds that can be directly placed on the chemical market [21–27]. Glycerol (GLY), being also the main by-product in biodiesel production, is certainly the most investigated biobased polyol with many important contributions published in the course of the years focused on its reductive catalytic upgrading into added value compounds [28–34]. The main focus of this review is to show recent progress and future challenges in the conversion of bioderived C6 and C5 polyols into energy (H2), fuels (linear alkanes) and chemicals (alcohols), highlighting the fundamental reductive catalytic processes that drive their conversion into desired products (e.g., hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis, reforming, retro-aldol condensation, etc.) as well as an overview on the recent advances in the preparation of tailored heterogeneous catalysts adopted in the last years to achieve this goal (Fig. 2 )."
1,Chemical processes for the reductive upgrading of biomass derived polyols,"The catalytic conversion of biomass-derived polyols to fuels and chemicals involves the presence and/or combination of various types of reactions, including C–O and C–C hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, dehydration, liquid and gas-phase reforming. In Fig. 3 , a qualitative diagram of the temperature and pressure ranges of in wich polyols are typically processed is sketched."
2,Hydrogenolysis and transfer hydrogenolysis reactions,"2.1 Hydrogenolysis and transfer hydrogenolysis reactions In hydrogenolysis reactions, carbon–oxygen and/or carbon–carbon bonds can be cleaved in the presence of added molecular hydrogen [23,35]. Even if the stoichiometry of the reactions is identical (R-X + H2 → R–H + H-X with X = O or C), from a thermodynamic point of view, the cleavage of C–O bond is generally highly exothermic while hydrogenolysis of C–C bond are almost energetically neutral (e.g. in the hydrogenolysis of the internal C–C bonds of sorbitol, the ΔH° value is of about −5 kcal/mol) [27]. In polyols, the hydrogenolysis of C–O bonds generally involves a prior dehydration (acid- or base-catalyzed) followed by a hydrogenation process (metal-catalyzed) while the cleavage of C–C bonds occurs via dehydrogenation/decarbonylation or retro-aldol reactions allowing the production of alcohols and glycols with a shorter carbon chains (such as glycerol, 1,2-propanediol and ethanol in the case of sorbitol) [23]. Due to the low solubility of molecular hydrogen in aqueous/alcoholic media, the cleavage of C–C and C–O bonds in polyols can be promoted by an indirect H-source in the so called “catalytic transfer hydrogenolysis” (CTH) reactions (generally 2-propanol, ethanol, methanol or formic acid are used) that allow, at the same time, the reduction of problems related to purchase, transport, storage and handling of the high H2 pressure [36–39]. This kind of reactions are getting more and more attention since most of the H-donor sources are now obtainable from renewable resources and represent a key component in the biomass valorization via the “lignin first” approach [40]."
3,Aqueous reforming processes,"2.2 Aqueous reforming processes At present, hydrogen (one of the most promising energy carrier) is mainly produced from fossil fuels such as natural gas, naphtha or coal. From a general point of view, polyols are surely among the most suitable substrates for the production of molecular hydrogen or syngas (H2 and CO) that can be further used as building blocks for the production of methanol and other chemicals, including liquid hydrocarbons through the Fischer–Tropsch technology [41,42]. The production of CO and H2 from polyols are conducted under vapour phase conditions and follows the general reaction: C n H 2y O n → nCO + yH2 By using water, CO can be further converted via water gas shift reaction (WGS) into H2 and CO2. The overall reaction process, known as Aqueous Phase Reforming (APR) [43–45], can be summarized as follows: C n H 2y O n → nCO + yH2 (Reforming) nCO + nH2O → nCO2 + nH2 (Water Gas Shift) C n H 2y O n + nH2O → nCO2 + (n + y)H2 Aqueous Phase Reforming APR reactions are conducted under relative mild reaction conditions generating gas products with very low level of CO concentration (≈100 ppm) since the pressure employed shifts the equilibrium conversion of CO and H2O toward the production of CO2. However, using temperatures and pressures adopted for APR reactions, the CO2 methanation is a competitive process that lowers the overall H2 yield [46,47]. Moreover, if APR reactions are carried out both in presence of H2 and a bifunctional catalyst (metal + acid sites), the conversion of polyols can be oriented towards the production of alkanes in the so called “Aqueous Phase Dehydration/Hydrogenation” (APD/H) process: C n H 2y O n + nH2 → CnH 2y + nH2O"

5,Reductive upgrading into added value chemicals,"3.1 Reductive upgrading into added value chemicals The reductive upgrading of sorbitol and xylitol allows the production of linear hydrocarbons as fuel compounds as well as other high value chemicals including C3–C2 polyols and alcohols. Starting from the pioneering studies of Montessier and co-workers [48], research efforts have been targeted mainly towards polyols conversion into GLY, 1,2-PDO, EG and lactic acid under hydrodeoxygenative conditions with Cu, Ni and Ru being the most adopted metals for the preparation of heterogeneous catalysts. From a general point of view, hydrogenolysis reactions are carried out in the presence of high pressure molecular H2 and hydroxides as additive in order to drive the product selectivity. It has been proved that, in presence of an alkaline base, the C–C bond breaking of aldehydes and ketones via retro-aldol condensation is favoured, thus allowing the production of 1,2-PDO and EG. Nickel-based catalysts have been the most investigated systems for their intrinsic high activity in the C–C and C–O bond breaking (Table 1 ). For example, in the hydrogenolysis of xylitol, Ni/C was found to be more selective to 1,2-PDO and EG if compared with the analogous Ru/C system as a result of its higher ability in the C–C cleavage of xylose [49]. The presence a solid base prevents also leaching and sintering phenomena thus increasing the catalyst stability and reusability with Ca(OH)2 being the most adopted. Moreover, it has been proved that the addition of La(OH)3 positively promotes the hydrogenolysis of sorbitol decreasing the selectivity towards lactic acid and other C3 products [50]. The role of the support is another key factor in the enhancing polyols conversion and in driving the selectivity towards desired products. The increase of the catalytic activity of Ni nanoparticles, as a consequence of the metal dispersion on the support, was demonstrated in plate-like Ni–Mg–Al layered double hydroxide systems where more accessible solid basic sites can positively promote the hydrogenolysis of sorbitol [51]. In general, if EG and 1,2-PDO are the desired reaction products, the use of a basic support favors dehydrogenation, retro-aldol and hydrogenation processes. For example, C2 and C3 polyols can be obtained, under mild conditions (200 °C, 20 bar of H2, 2 h), in the hydrogenolysis of sorbitol over Ni/MgxAlyOx based catalysts with different Mg/Al molar ratio [52]. Accordingly, when inert fly ashes were used as support of Ni-based catalysts for sorbitol hydrogenolysis, very low conversions were registered at 200 °C and 60 bar of H2 [53]. Hydroxyapatite (HAP) was found to be a valid support for Ni based catalysts with rod-shape (HAP-R) more active with respect to needle (HAP-N) and sphere (HAP-S) shapes [54]. Moreover, the addition of Sr (up to 6%) in the hydroxyapatite structure increases the catalyst activity as a result of the increase of the support basicity [54]. The superior activity of nickel as active metal was also confirmed in M-phosphides (Ni2P, CoP, Cu3P, Fe2P, WP) supported on carbon systems [55]. Likewise, the addition of cerium into Ni/Al2O3 catalysts afforded a promoting effect in the conversion of sorbitol into C3–C2 polyols [56] as well as a stabilizing effect of the nickel nanoparticles on the mesoporous metal-oxide support (TiO2) for the hydrogenolysis of xylitol [57]. Accordingly, with respect to the analogous Ni–MgO system, Co–MgO catalyst promotes the formation of 1,2-PDO more than EG even if a lower conversion of sorbitol was registered [58]. Platinum-group metals (PGMs) were found, by far, less efficient than nickel in the hydrogenolysis of polyols. Even the addition of nickel on Pt/NaY catalysts had only a marginal effect in promoting sorbitol conversion into 1,2-PDO and EG [59]. Over the Pt/C catalyst, the major reaction product observed was lactic acid in presence of NaOH that efficiently promotes the C–C bond breaking of aldehydes and ketones via the retro-aldol condensation. The process is self-sustainable with the hydrogen necessary for the hydrogenolysis process generated via dehydrogenation of the polyol itself [60]. Palladium was surely the less investigated metal of the PGMs group. In a recent report, Mauriello and co-workers investigated the hydrogenolysis of several polyols at low molecular hydrogen pressure (5 bar) [61]. The heterogeneous Pd/Fe3O4 catalyst was found to be much more active than the commercial Pd/C system in the production of C2–C3 alcohols (ethanol in particular) as a result of bimetallic Pd–Fe species on the catalyst surface. Moreover, the Pd/Fe3O4 catalyst shows excellent performance in promoting the water-gas-shift (WGS) reaction as revealed by the total absence of CO in gas phase products. Heterogeneous copper and ruthenium systems represent the most attention-grabbing alternatives to nickel-based catalysts in promoting the conversion of polyols in presence of H2 (Tables 2 and 3 ) [62–84]. In presence of Cu/C, sorbitol can be transformed, under mild reaction conditions (160 °C, 50 bar H2, 2 h reaction time), into 1,2-PDO and EG in a good conversion (42%) [62]. The variation of the copper nanoparticle size has no significant effect on the product selectivity that, in contrast, is strongly influenced by the amount of the added Ca(OH)2. Lactic acid and glycerol, formed during the hydrogenolysis reaction, can be in-situ converted, over the copper surface, into the desired 1,2-PDO. In contrast, by using SiO2 as support in the xylitol hydrogenolysis, a strong dependence of the catalytic activity and of the products selectivity on the Cu particle size was registered [63]. Bimetallic Ni–Cu/SiO2 and Ni–Cu/ZnO catalysts were efficiently adopted in the hydrogenolysis of xylitol showing a better activity and selectivity towards C3–C2 glycols than analogous monometallic Cu-systems [64,65]. Together with nickel, also palladium was efficiently used as co-metal in Cu-based catalysts [66,67]. Addition of Pd to Cu-based nanocatalysts supported on graphene allows to achieve a remarkable enhancement of the catalytic systems activity and stability in the production of lactic acid at 200 °C from sorbitol and xylitol [66]. Accordingly, bimetallic Pd–Cu/ZrO2 systems shows superior activities in sorbitol hydrogenolysis as well as a higher selectivity to the two target glycols (EG and 1,2-PDO) if compared with analogous monometallic Cu/ZrO2 and Pd/ZrO2 catalysts [67]. Moreover, the addition of palladium prevents agglomeration of Cu nanoparticles leading to a high catalyst stability and recyclability [67]. On using bimetallic Cu/CaO–Al2O3 catalysts can also avoid addition of base promoters in the aqueous-phase hydrogenolysis of sorbitol. The direct interaction between metallic Cu and Ca2+ cations in the catalytic system facilitates, in fact, the C–C and C–O bond breaking allowing the production of EG, 1,2-PDO and 1,2-BDO [68]. From a mechanistic point of view, a lot of research efforts has been done by the research group of Prof. Palkovitz in order to elucidate the complex reactions that occur in the hydrogenolysis of C6–C5 polyols. A schematic representation of the reaction pathways in the conversion of sorbitol into EG,1,2-PDO and other added value chemicals is presented in Fig. 4 . By using the CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst, at 245 °C and 50 bar of H2, the composition of liquid-phase products allowed to propose a unified reaction mechanism ruled by elementary transformations that include dehydrogenation/hydrogenation, dehydration, isomerization and retro-aldol cleavage [69]. The same authors elucidated the complete product spectrum (as well as reactions kinetics) of the aqueous Ru/C-catalyzed hydrogenolysis of sorbitol, erythritol, xylitol, sorbitol both in presence and in absence of acidic additives [70,71]. Under neutral conditions, the decarbonylation of terminal groups is favoured while, by adding silicotungstic acid in the reaction medium, deoxygenative products are formed [70]. The research attention on ruthenium systems as heterogeneous catalysts, for production of chemicals and fuel from biomass derived polyols, has been progressively increased since they were found to show high performance both in conversion and selectivity as well as relatively low market price. The hydrogenolysis of sorbitol over Ru based catalysts shows a dependence on pH and temperature [72]. In a basic medium, independently from the temperature adopted, the main reaction is a reverse aldolization while under neutral conditions, the hydrogenolysis of C–C bonds in the middle of the carbon chain is generally observed. Interestingly, by using an acidic niobium phosphate support, Ru nanoparticles can promote dehydration of sorbitol into sorbitan avoiding its hydrogenolysis into glycols [73]. Surely carbon (C), active carbon (AC) or carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were the most adopted support for ruthenium nanoparticles [74–83]. In one of the first report, Sun and Liu, presented the superior activity of the Ru/C catalyst than analogous Ru/TiO2, Ru/ZrO2, Ru/Al2O3 and Ru/Mg2AlOx systems in the hydrogenolysis of xylitol [74] demonstrating that the dehydrogenation of xylitol to xylose on the ruthenium surfaces as well as the base-catalyzed retro-aldol condensation are the key step in the production of 1,2-PDO and EG. The presence of a base is, in fact, crucial for the production of C3–C2 glycols since, without its presence, epimerization and cascade decarbonylation were the predominant reactions thus allowing production of C5–C4 alditols and light alkanes [75]. Also in the hydrogenolysis of sorbitol, the best results were obtained by using carbon-based supports containing Ru nanoparticle (Ru/MgO, Ru/Al2O3, Ru/ZrO2 and Ru/TiO2 were found to be less efficient) with Ca(OH) or CaO being the best base additive for the production of 1,2-PDO and EG [76,77]. The kinetic isotopic effect studies highlight that the dehydrogenation process is the kinetically relevant step in the hydrogenolysis reaction. It was also demonstrated that the presence of sulphur reduces the ruthenium activity minimizing, at the same time, formation of straight chain hydrocarbons. Under semi-continuous conditions, the Ru/C catalyst allows the production of arabitol, xylitol and glycerol as the main reaction products while, upon increasing the reaction temperature, a higher selectivity to methane and ethane was also registered [78]. If xylitol hydrogenolysis is carried out in alkaline aqueous solutions, by using a trickle-bed reactor, EG and 1,2-PDO can be obtained under relative mild conditions (200 °C, 60 bar H2) [79]. On the other hand, using activated carbon or carbon nanotubes as support, the catalytic properties of Ru strongly depend on the location of ruthenium nanoparticles. In particular, an excellent performance can be observed in the hydrogenolysis of sorbitol as a result of the altered metal-support interaction and the electronic state of ruthenium nanoparticles located outside CNTs [80]. Moreover, CNTs can be functionalized with NH2, COOH, OH and nitrogen-doping groups with the aim to further increase the activity of Ru/CNTs in the hydrogenolysis of sorbitol [81]. When ruthenium is directly impregnated with Ca(OH)2, a higher yield of glycols can be obtained than with analogous systems where the alkali promoter is added separately to the reaction medium [82]. At the same time, incorporation of nickel into the calcium hydroxide permits a positive effect both on sorbitol conversion and glycols selectivity as well as on the stability of the supported Ru-based catalyst. Interestingly, analogous results were also obtained by adding Re on the Ru/C catalyst [83]. The bifunctional Ru/MnO/C catalyst was tested in the hydrogenolysis of xylitol in different water/organic solvent mixtures showing that an increase of the organic fraction (methanol) produces a higher selectivity to glycols with a concurrent catalyst deactivation caused by the alcoholic solvent dehydrogenation affording light alkanes and coke on the Ru surface [84]. Ru–Pt based catalysts supported on SiO2–Al2O3 were tested in the hydrogenolysis of sorbitol carried out in an aqueous medium in a batch reactor at 240 °C under 60 bar H2 pressure with oxygenated compounds in liquid phase and hydrocarbons in gaseous phase being the main observed products [85]."
6,Conversion of sorbitol and xylitol into hydrocarbon fuels,"3.2 Conversion of sorbitol and xylitol into hydrocarbon fuels In the case of C6–C5 polyols, the production of linear hydrocarbons follows the general stoichiometry: C6H14O6 (sorbitol) + 6H2 → C6H14 (hexane) + 6H2O C5H12O5 (xylitol) + 5H2 → C5H12 (pentane) + 5H2O It is well established that the production of alkanes from polyols involves (i) a dehydration step, on a solid support, and (ii) a following hydrogenation process ensured by the hydrogen formed over the metal sites of the catalyst [26]. Dumesic and co-workers demonstrated that C2–C6 alkanes can be formed starting form sorbitol over bifunctional catalyst systems (Pt/SiO2–Al2O3 and Pd/SiO2–Al2O3) in which sorbitol is primary dehydrated on SiO2–Al2O3 support and then hydrogenated on Pt or Pd metal species with the hydrogen produced in-situ by APR process [86]. However, it is worth to underline that, under the reaction conditions generally adopted, many other catalytic processes can take place, including methanation, alkylation, hydrocracking and cyclization reactions.Whereas deoxygenative processes of polyols can be promoted by a wide range of active metals, the conversion of sorbitol and xylitol into C6–C5 alkanes, in high yield, have been carried out mostly on heterogeneous Pt, Ru and Re catalysts (Table 4 ). The catalytic activity of Ni/HZSM-5 in the hydrogenation of sorbitol into liquid alkanes can be improved by adding MCM-41 allowing a liquid alkanes selectivity of 98.7% [87,88]. The superior activity of Pt-based catalysts was confirmed in the continuous flow hydrodeoxygenation of sorbitol into gasoline-range hydrocarbons investigated over Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru, Ni metals supported on tungstated alumina (WA) [89]. At 250 °C and 40 bar of H2, the Pt/NbOPO4 catalyst is able to convert sorbitol to C6 and C5 alkanes (60% overall yield) with isosorbide being the key intermediate in the Aqueous Phase Dehydration/Hydrogenation (APD/H) process which undergoes ring opening followed by C–O bond cleavage [90]. The addition of a second metal (Re, Ir, Rh and Pd) was proved to increase the activity of the Pt/SiO2–Al2O3 catalyst in the conversion of sorbitol into hexane with Re being the most active [91,92]. The presence of ruthenium on MoO3−x/C catalysts positively promote the production of C6–C5 alkanes from sorbitol in a continuous flow reactor. RuMoO3−x/C catalysts shows high performance in sorbitol aqueous phase dehydration/hydrogenation without a significant decrease of activity after 200 h of time on stream [93]. The research group of Prof. Tomishige deeply investigated the ReOx-modified Ir metal catalyst (Ir-ReOx) as an effective catalytic system able to convert C5–C3 polyols, sugars and cellulose into linear alkanes [94–97]. A model structure of the Ir-ReOx catalytic system is presented in Fig. 5 . By using the Ir-ReOx/SiO2 catalyst combined with H-ZSM-5, n-hexane and n-pentane can be obtained, in high yield, at very low reaction temperatures (170-140 °C) [95]. On the other hand, addition of Pt as co-metal in the Ir-ReOx/SiO2 system improves the C–C cracking activity of the catalyst allowing to obtain gasoline-ranged products in high yield."
7,Hydrogen production via aqueous phase reforming (APR),"3.3 Hydrogen production via aqueous phase reforming (APR) Hydrogen production via Aqueous Phase Reforming (APR) was introduced, for the first time in 2002, by Dumesic and co-workers [98] and appears as research area of great interest since: - with respect to “classic” reforming processes that are highly endothermic, APR reactions require a little energy supply to be carried out; - catalytic APR processes can be achieved by using a mixture of various lignocellulosic-derived compounds as feedstock; - H2 can be produced in high purity and, theoretically, directly useable for energy production in fuel cells; - H2 production by APR could be generated from sorbitol at a very competitive price if polyols can be directly obtainable from lignocellulosic biomass (instead of sugars) [99,100]. In APR reactions, the crucial step is the terminal C–C bond breaking by combined dehydrogenation/decarbonylation processes that produce H2 and CO, shortening, step by step, the polyol carbon skeleton as represented in Fig. 6 . As already mentioned, carbon monoxide can further undergo WGS reaction allowing the additional production of H2 and CO2. In a recent contribution, an in-situ ATR-IR study of the surface reactions occurring during the APR of sorbitol over the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst confirms that the key intermediate is the CO formed from the dehydrogenation process [101]. The dehydrogenation of sorbitol, strongly anchored on the Lewis acid sites of the alumina support with adsorbed alkoxy species, in fact, may allow the formation of an aldehyde or a ketone with the first easily decarbonylated whereas latter cannot undergo the same reaction and contribute to poison platinum sites. Platinum-based catalysts are the most adopted systems under both batch and continuous flow apparatus with the latter being the largely used conditions (Table 5 ). APR of sorbitol can be carried out also in carbon-coated ceramic (Al2O3) tubular membrane reactor where the hydrogen produced can be continuously removed from the reaction medium by permeation to the shell side whilst the liquid remains into the tube side [102]. Since its pioneering use as efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the aqueous phase reforming of sorbitol, glycerol, ethylene glycol and methanol, Pt/Al2O3 is the most studied catalytic system in the production of H2 from polyols [103–109]. Both kinetics modelling [103] and mechanism investigations [104] have been presented showing that over 260 reaction intermediates are involved in the transformation of sorbitol into H2 via APR. In general, under the same reaction conditions, C5 and C6 polyols show similar APR behaviour even if higher H2 selectivity can be obtained in the case of xylitol [105]. In a very elegant contribution, it was also demonstrated that the chirality of the initial feedstocks does not affect the reaction rate and selectivity to the final products in the APR of C6 polyols [106]. Apesteguía and co-workers investigated the effect of Pt loading and reaction conditions on H2 production from several C6–C2 polyols, including sorbitol and xylitol [107–109]. H2 yield and productivity increase on increasing the platinum surface and by using shorter-chain polyols [107]. By using sorbitol as feedstock, at a given space velocity, it was demonstrated that the production of H2 does not depend on the feed-concentration [108] in contrast with xylitol where H2 selectivity and productivity decrease on increasing the xylitol concentration [109]. Platinum was also efficiently supported on several carbon materials (e.g. activated carbons, sibunit carbon type, three dimensional bimodal and mesoporous carbons) for the preparation of heterogeneous catalysts active in the conversion of polyols into H2 [110–113]. Carbon-supported mono- and bimetallic-systems based on VIII group metals (Pt, Ni, Re, Ru, Pt–Ni, Pt–Re, Pt–Ru and Pt–Co) were prepared and tested in the APR of xylitol in a fixed-bed reactor at 225 °C [110]. Monometallic Pt/C was found to be an optimum carbon-supported system since Ni/C, Ru/C and Re/C catalysts notably exhibit lower activity. Moreover, in this case, addition of a second metal to Pt/C was not found to be beneficial for hydrogen production with the exception of the Pt–Fe/CMK-9 (3-D cubic ordered mesoporous carbon) catalyst where the presence of Fe considerably enhances the catalytic performance, showing the optimum activity at the Pt:Fe ratio of 1:3 [114]. Nevertheless, heterogeneous bimetallic systems represent an important field of research also in the APR of biomass derived polyols [115−123]. PtNi/Al2O3 and PtCo/Al2O3 catalysts allow a higher H2 yield, as well as a better stability during the on-stream experiments, if compared with the monometallic Pt/Al2O3 [115]. In particular, on using the PtNi/Al2O3 a higher hydrogen production can be boosted even at long reaction times while addition of Co ensures to keep low levels of methane and coke formation. Also Re was adopted as co-metal in the aqueous phase reforming of sorbitol [116] and xylitol [117], although bimetallic Pt–Re systems were also found very active in alkane formation but, by far, less efficient than monometallic Pt/TiO2 and Pd/Al2O3 catalyst in the production of hydrogen that, anyway, can be enhanced by its continuous stripping from the reaction medium. Beyond traditional APR methods carried out under batch and continuous flow conditions, Colmenares and co-workers proposed, for the first time, a photocatalytic reforming process that allows to produce H2 from a glucose aqueous solution in the presence of Pt/TiO2 as heterogeneous catalyst. High-thermal redox treatment of the system at 850 °C allows a greater SMSI effect and a better catalytic performance of the Pt/TiO2 system together with an increase in the hydrogen molar production [118]. It is also worth to mention that Ni–Pt and Ni–Pd species supported on alumina nano-fibers have been successfully used as bimetallic heterogeneous systems in the APR of sorbitol [119,120] with a rate of H2 formation 3 to 5 times higher than that obtained with the analogous monometallic Ni-based catalyst. Furthermore, Raney-Ni and Raney-NiSn catalysts show good activity and stability in the continuous aqueous-phase reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons with a concomitant low formation of methane with analogous Al2O3-supported Ni and Ni–Sn systems exhibiting a significant catalyst deactivation as a consequence of sintering processes [121]. The excellent performance of this non–precious metal catalysts in the H2 production of hydrogen from ethylene glycol, glycerol, and sorbitol is surely a milestone in the study of APR processes [122]."
8,Concluding remarks,"The use of biomass and their derived molecules for production of energy, biofuels and chemicals cannot longer wait. It is out of the question that in the near future biomass derived C6 and C5 polyols, already included in the list of the most promising bio-derived platform molecules, will be among the key renewable feedstocks for greener future biorefinery processes. Deoxygenation processes can be the key to convert sorbitol and xylitol, C6 and C5 polyols respectively, into important chemicals such as 1,2-propandiol and ethylene glycol with heterogeneous Cu-, Ni- and Ru-based catalysts that can efficiently promote the C–O and C–C cleavage in the presence of a solid base, generally calcium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide, that avoids the phenomena of catalyst leaching and sintering and drives the selectivity into desired reaction products (glycols). Addition of a co-metal improves the activity, selectivity and stability of the catalytic systems allowing, at the same time, the use of milder reaction conditions (180–200 °C and 5–20 bar of H2). Heterogeneous bimetallic systems are also the most adopted heterogeneous catalysts in the production of linear hydrocarbons from polyols. These processes are conducted, if compared with deoxygenation reactions, at harsh reactions conditions (250–300 °C and 40–80 bar of H2) and suffer the concurrent presence of several competing reactions that lower the selectivity into C6 and C5 alkanes. Production of renewable H2 from biomass derived polyols can be successfully accomplished via aqueous phase reforming (APR) reactions that represent a sustainable, low energy demanding catalytic process that allows formation of hydrogen in high yield with a low carbon monoxide content. APR processes are generally conducted under continuous flow conditions at relative mild temperatures (220–250 °C) and high pressures (20–50 bar) and are promoted by Pt- and Ni-based catalysts. Surely the monometallic Pt/Al2O3 is the most adopted heterogeneous catalyst, however, comparable results can be obtained also by using bimetallic Ni systems. Even though catalytic hydrogenolysis, deoxygenation and aqueous phase reforming are very well-known processes, it is more necessary now than ever to develop more efficient and non-precious heterogeneous catalysts able to produce chemicals, fuels and H2 from biobased sorbitol and xylitol. Moreover, with respect to dehydrogenation/hydrogenation processes, new catalytic systems with base functionalities should be tracked in order to avoid the use of inorganic additives that cannot be recovered from the reaction medium. On the other hand, the design of new catalytic systems able to promote the conversion of polyols into linear alkanes in presence of lower H2 pressure as well as the preparation of stable and reusable heterogeneous catalysts operating for long for long time-on-stream APR processes are absolutely among the future targets to be achieved."
