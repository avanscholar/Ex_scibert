0,Introduction,"Carbon-neutral biomass is considering a promising route to reduce the environmental issues and energy crisis associated with fossil resources. Oxidation and hydrogenation of biomass-derived platform chemicals are regarded as important routes to achieve the upgrading of biomass [1–4]. Biomass-derived furfural is recently advocated as a platform for a versatile of fine chemicals and potential fuel component [5–7]. A series of importantly value-added chemicals (e.g., furfuryl alcohol (FA), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF), furan, cyclopentanone, furoic acid) can be selectively obtained from the transformation of furfural in principle (Scheme 1 ). Among variously valuable products, FA and THFA can be selectively produced from the hydrogenation of furfural using copper-based catalyst [8,9]. One of the most often used catalysts was copper chromite [8]. Other types of catalysts (e.g., Cu/MgO [10], Cu/C [9], Raney Ni [11] and amorphous Ni alloys [12]) have been frequently developed [13,14]. Homogeneous catalysts were often used such as the complexes of Rh, Ru and Pt noble metals [15–18]. Besides, the homogeneous catalyst was also reported to produce ring opening products (butanal, butanol and butane) by changing the catalyst component and operation conditions [19]. Due to the recyclability and eco-friendly properties, solid catalyst has attracted a number of efforts. Recently, Poliakoff et al. [20] reported the above five products (FA, THFA, 2-methylfuran (2-MF), 2-MTHF, and furan) can be obtained with good yields using a twin catalyst system (Pd/C and copper chromite) and switching reaction conditions in a continuous-flow reactor. However, no further information of the various metal influence and different support influence on products distribution were reported. Reddy et al. [21] reported the metal influence on the formation of FA using silica supported transition metal-based bimetallic catalysts (Co-Ni, Co-Cu, Ni-Cu). Resasco et al. [19] reported various metals (Cu, Ni, Pd) influence on formation of different products. Metal Cu mainly influenced the formation of FA, Pd mainly influenced the formation of furan and THF by decarbonylation and further hydrogenation, and metal Ni mainly influenced on opening products such as butanol. Recently, we have found the bimetallic CuCr was good for the formation of FA and bimetallic CuFe was beneficial for the formation of methylfuran [22]. As well discussed the metal influence, however, few reports try to explore the support influence. Kijenski et al. [23] reported the deposited Pt on monolayer oxides (SiO2, Al2O3, MgO, TiO2) on the hydrogenation of furfural to FA. However, no support influence was found on the selectivity of FA. Several other studies have reported the utilization of Pd, Pt, Ni nanoparticles on the supports of carbon nanotube and metal oxides for the hydrogenation of furfural [20–23]. Unfortunately, the support influence was still less studied. Besides, the leach or aggregation of metal nanoparticles during the harsh reaction environment still require more attention. Herein, we aim at study of the support influence on the distribution of products and report an effective methodology to confine metal nanoparticles. The typical mesoporous materials MCM-41 series samples (MCM-41, TiMCM-41 ZrMCM-41 and SnMCM-41) were employed, and to make a clear comparison, several amorphous supports such as SiO2 and Al2O3 were also used."

2,Chemical sources,"2.1 Chemical sources The following chemicals were bought directly from commercial companies. Tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, 98+% pure, Sigma-Aldrich), surfactant hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, Aldrich), hydrochloride acid (37–38%, J.T.

CO2 (purity >99.99%) and H2 (purity >99.99%) were supplied by Guangzhou Air Limited."
3,Mesoporous support synthesis,"2.2 Mesoporous support synthesis The classic synthesis procedure of MCM-41, ZrMCM-41, TiMCM-41 and SnMCM-41 was similar to the previous works [24] and more details of the support synthesis was depicted in the Supporting Information (SI). Surfactant CTAB (hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide) were used as the structure-directing agent and TEOS was used as the silicon source. Zirconium n-butyl oxide (20% in 80% butanol) was used for synthesis of ZrMCM-41 as the zirconium source. Titanium (IV) n-butoxide for the synthesis of TiMCM-41 and SnCl2 for SnMCM-41. Metal Pd nanoparticles were confined in mesoporous channels (MCM-41, TiMCM-41, ZrMCM-41 and SnMCM-41) using supercritical CO2 deposition method, where allyl (cyclopentadienyl)-palladium (II) [CpPd (η3-C3H5)] was used for the deposition of Pd nanoparticles. More details of the synthesis of Pd nanoparticles are similar to our previous work [24] and described in SI."
4,Selective hydrogenation of furfural,"2.3 Selective hydrogenation of furfural The fabricated Pd-nanoparticles on various supports (MCM-41, TiMCM-41, ZrMCM-41, SnMCM-41, SiO2, Al2O3) were evaluated in the selective hydrogenation of furfural using the batch reactor (mini-autoclave). The process and analysis are similar to our previous work [25,26]. After centrifugation, the catalyst and reaction solution was separated. The obtained solution was further passed through the neutral aluminum oxide. RC4 membrane was further used to filtrate the solution and then dichloromethane was employed to dilute the mixture. The obtained samples were analyzed by GC Aglient 6890 N and details were depicted in SI."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Synthesis and characterizations of the resulting Pd nanoparticles,"3.1 Synthesis and characterizations of the resulting Pd nanoparticles Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis for typical peaks of different MCM-41 series samples display the hexagonally ordered structure (Fig. 1 a), which were indexed as (100) at 2.5°, (110) at 4.4°, (200) at 5.1°. Only MCM-41 sample was observed clearly (210) at 6.7°, nearly no peaks at 6.7° could be found in other MCM-41 series samples. Furthermore, with the metal Ti, Zr, and Sn insertion into the skeleton of the MCM-41 ordered structure, the intensity of (100) peak become weaker and weaker, this was possibly ascribed to the larger ion substitution process between the much heavier metal Pd and Si as reported before [27]. Overall, all the resulting MCM-41 series samples were prepared successfully, which was consistent with values from former literature [28]. EDX spectra of the synthesized TiMCM-41, ZrMCM-41 and SnMCM-41 samples were depicted in Fig. S1, the results indicated the successful insertion of Ti, Zr, and Sn, which was consistent with XRD results. Fig. 1b shows the diffraction pattern of Pd with (111), (200), (220) and (311), which were well matched with the fcc phase of Pd (JCPDS No. 046-1043, Fm3m), and it was also fitted with the previous reports [29,30]. The N2 adsorption-desorption curves and the calculated BET areas of these typical samples were listed in details to compare as shown in Table 1 . The isotherm curves of the chosen MCM-41 series examples were depicted in Fig. S2. Type IV isotherm curves were obtained and the calculated values of surface area, pore volume were summarized in Table 1. All samples possessed high surface areas (>400 m2/g) and enough mesopore volume, which would be helpful for the heterogeneous catalytic processes. Compared to the pristine mesoporous support, the introduce of 5 wt% Pd reduced the surface area from 684 to 630 m2/g and the average pore volume of mesopore of the pristine support from 0.518 to 0.456 cm3/g as well as the series MCM-41 samples with surface area and mesopore volume decreased to 596 m2/g and 0.483 cm3/g respectively for 5 wt% Pd/TiMCM-41, 570 m2/g and 0.426 cm3/g for 5 wt% Pd/ZrMCM-41 and 400 m2/g and 0.361 cm3/g for 5 wt% Pd/SnMCM-41, even so the samples still held large surface area and mesopore volume. Nevertheless, the pore diameter of the mesopore kept nearly intact, which indicated the deposition of Pd nanoparticles had no negative effect on the pore structure that was advantageous for the catalytic process. TEM (transmission electron microscopy) image (Fig. 2 a) showed the synthesized MCM-41 presented the parallel and hexagonal pores structure. Generally, the calculation of grain size distribution from electron microscopy was as previously reported [24,31]. TEM image and particle size dispersion of the resulting 5 wt% Pd/MCM-41 nanoparticles were shown in Fig. S3. Pd nanoparticles were finely confined in the mesoporous channel of MCM-41, where the average size was around 4.1 nm. The lattice fringe was clearly presented and the d spacing of 0.224 nm was measured in Fig. S4. Simultaneously, the small particles were loaded on the TiMCM-41, ZrMCM-41 and SnMCM-41, TEM images were shown in Fig. 2, b-d. We took 300 respective particles to estimate the particle size dispersion and average sizes. Pd nanoparticles were evenly dispersed on the series of MCM-41 supports and the average particle sizes of the Pd catalyst was determined to be 4.5, 4.2, 5.0 nm respectively (Fig. 2, b-d). Generally, no clear aggregation was observed from the obtained TEM images. X-Ray Photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were applied to study the surface oxidation state of Pd nanoparticles. Fig. 3 shows the XPS results of two prominent sets of Pd (3d) peaks at 340.6 eV (3d3/2) and 335.3 eV (3d5/2) on the selected surface of MCM-41 and TiMCM-41 catalyst (Fig. 3). No visible PdO was observed by XPS indicating that the fresh 5 wt% Pd/MCM-41 and 5 wt% Pd/TiMCM-41 catalysts were in the reduction state. For evaluating the acidity of MCM-41 series catalysts, NH3-TPD was employed as displayed in Fig. 4 . Due to desorption results were related to the interaction between NH3 and acid sites of the samples, ammonia desorbed from stronger acid sites occurred at higher temperature. Obviously, 5 wt% Pd/TiMCM-41 and 5 wt% Pd/ZrMCM-41 samples both held a desorption peak at around 160 °C, indicating the existing of weak acid sites in the catalysts. Additionally, desorption peak at around 350 °C represents moderate acid sites. According to the results of quantitative analysis, 5 wt% Pd/TiMCM-41 had the largest weak and moderate acid sites, which were 0.23 mmol/g and 0.65 mmol/g and Pd/ZrMCM-41 had a relatively less acid sites which were 0.1 mmol/g and 0.35 mmol/g respectively while Pd/SnMCM-41 had almost no weak and moderate acid sites compared to the former two. At higher temperature, both 5 wt% Pd/TiMCM-41 and 5 wt% Pd/ZrMCM-41 had weak desorption peak which represented the two samples had only a small number of strong acid sites. However, according to the desorption peak, the 5 wt% Pd/SnMCM-41 sample exhibited a desorbed tendency at higher temperature which went beyond the pre-set temperature range, the result indicated that 5 wt% Pd/SnMCM-41 had strong acid site on the surface."
7,Evaluation of Pd supported on different support,"3.2 Evaluation of Pd supported on different support Fig. 5 showed the as-obtained Pd nanoparticles confined on different support for the selective hydrogenation of furfural. In general, all the resulting Pd catalysts displayed good activity, although big difference was found among different catalysts. First, the pristine support MCM-41 exhibited negligible conversion of furfural and very low selectivity towards the desired products. After the homo-dispersion of Pd nanoparticles, all MCM-41 series catalysts and the amorphous series catalysts showed dramatically increased activity for the hydrogenation reaction of furfural. Additionally, the MCM-41 series catalysts showed a relatively higher selectivity toward THFA compared to the amorphous series catalysts which indicated that the hydrogenation process mainly occurred on the ring and a carbonyl double bond for the MCM-41 series catalysts. For the amorphous series catalysts (Pd on SiO2 or Al2O3), the hydrogenation process mainly occurred on carboxyl group. Besides, compared to the amorphous series catalysts, MCM-41 series catalysts displayed a certain amount of selectivity towards THF while amorphous series catalysts had no activity for the formation of THF. The stronger acidity would promote deep hydrogenation of furfural."
8,Stability of the synthesized Pd nanoparticles,"3.3 Stability of the synthesized Pd nanoparticles In order to investigate the stability of the resulting catalysts, 5 wt% Pd/MCM-41 was used. After reaction, Pd nanoparticles were separated through centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 30 min and then dried at 80 °C for 12 h. Before XRD test, no further treatment was employed. XRD (Fig. 6 ) confirmed the 5 wt% Pd/MCM-41 catalyst was stable in hydrogenation of furfural. For supported metal catalysts, it was easy to get oxidized surface. To avoid the oxidation on the surface, all the spent catalysts were further treated with 20 g CO2 for 2 h impregnation and then 20 bars hydrogen for 1 h reduction. The directly spent catalysts and the reduced catalyst were further characterized by XPS (Fig. 7 ) to study the surface oxidation state [32,33]. In the case of spent catalyst (Fig. 7a), two prominent sets of Pd (3d3/2 via 3d5/2) peaks at 342.5 eV (3d3/2) and 337.1 eV (3d5/2) demonstrated that a certain amount of PdO2 existed on the surface. Pd (3d3/2 via 3d5/2) peaks at 340.6 eV (3d3/2) and 335.3 eV (3d5/2) showed relatively large amount of Pd0 was present on the surface in the reduced form. Normally, the reduction of the recycled catalysts would lead unavoidable aggregation of particles. The catalytic activity was shown in Fig. S5 over several runs, no big change took place toward the product distribution. The two main products FA and THFA display similar values over three runs, which further confirmed the used metal Pd nanoparticles were very stable in the hydrogenation reaction."
9,Conclusions,"Selective conversion of biomass-derived furfural using the supported Pd catalysts on various supports (TiMCM-41, ZrMCM-41, SnMCM-41, SiO2, Al2O3) by chemical fluid deposition (CFD) methods was achieved in autoclave reactor. High selectivity toward furfuryl alcohol was achieved using Pd supported on amorphous supports (SiO2, Al2O3), whereby the hydrogenation mainly occurred on carboxyl group. In contrast, high selectivity toward furfuryl alcohol and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol was obtained using Pd supported on mesoporous supports (TiMCM-41, ZrMCM-41, SnMCM-41), whereas the hydrogenation mainly both occurred on the ring and a carbonyl double bond. The different product distribution was strongly related to the type of supports and the strength of interaction between the furan ring and the metal surface. Besides, the Pd nanoparticle confined in the mesoporous channel was more stable, displaying no clear difference even recycle for three times. This work may provide a good way to facilely synthesize metal nanoparticles efficient for the transformation of biomass-derived chemicals into highly value-added products."
