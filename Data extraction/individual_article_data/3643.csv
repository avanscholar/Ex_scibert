0,Introduction,"Since 1990s, the two major problems of environmental protection and shortage of petroleum resources have attracted worldwide attention [1,2]. To avoid the contradiction between the shortage of petroleum resources and demand, and to achieve long-term sustainable economic development and environmental protection, it is necessary to develop alternative clean fuels to partly replace petroleum-based fuels for internal combustion engines. As a form of renewable energy, bioenergy can substitute for fossil fuels, as well as reducing the global warming caused by human activities to a certain extent [3,4]. Among which, biodiesel made from non-edible, edible oils or animal fats seems to be the feasible substitutes of petroleum diesel [5] and the corresponding technology has rapidly become a hot spot in the research and development of new energy. As biodiesel made from vegetable oils is renewable and has better fuel characteristics to petro-diesel including high oxygen content, sulfur and aromatics free, etc. [6,7]. However, the application of vegetable oils including corn oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil, rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil [8,9] in diesel engines face a common problem, that is, high viscosity and low fluidity of vegetable oil lead to poor atomization and combustion [10,11]. Rapeseed oil has the application potential as a substitute fuel when the fuel characteristics are optimized [12,13]. Rapeseed oil has low volatility, high viscosity and density, which restricts its usage as the substitute of diesel fuel. Researchers have found that transesterification, pyrolysis and other related methods can produce biodiesel corresponding to rapeseed oil, thereby improving its fuel characteristics [14,15]. In transesterification process, some catalysts are needed, such as acid catalysts, alkali catalysts and lipase catalysts [16–18]. However, the efficiency of catalysts is easily limited by production parameters, such as temperature and pressure. Kouzu et al. [19] studied the catalytic activity of the calcined scallop shell during the process of rapeseed oil biodiesel production via the transesterification and the results were compared to that of the calcined limestone. Results showed that the key point was on the content of Na in the source material. The Na from shell blending with basic-MgCO3 was increased after calcination, which eventually enhanced the catalytic activity. However, additional energy was required for shell pre-treatment as well as for catalytic reactions during this procedure. Farobie et al. [20] elucidated the reaction kinetics via the continuous production of canola biodiesel. The product yields under different reaction times and temperatures were mainly studied. Results showed that the highest biodiesel yield was obtained at a relative high temperature and moderate reaction time. Therefore, in the process of transesterification, the consumption of heat energy and the addition of catalysts are unavoidable. Meanwhile, viscosity improvement of the blended alcohols and vegetable oil was also studied. These studies were mainly related to the fuel blends with high-carbon alcohols, and little studies were carried out to investigate the blending with low-carbon alcohols [21–23]. In fact, the blending of rapeseed oil and low-carbon alcohols can be an efficient method to produce a fuel which can be applied in diesel engine directly. This is due to methanol or ethanol has lower viscosity compared to that of rapeseed oil and very easy to obtain at low price. Furthermore, the addition of methanol or ethanol into biodiesel or diesel fuel can increase the engine efficiency and lower the emissions of NOx and particulate matters (PM) to some extent [24–27]. Compared with transesterification, direct blending of rapeseed oil and low-carbon alcohols can avoid additional energy consumption and simplify the fuel preparation process. However, low-carbon alcohols, especially methanol and ethanol, have unideal inter-solubility in the binary blends with rapeseed oil, which restricts the use as the stable fuel. In the meanwhile, the addition of methanol or ethanol decreases the cetane number (CN) of the blend. Therefore, a co-solvent fuel has to be added to help dissolve and adjust the CN of the ternary system. Reagents commonly used for solubilization of fuel systems include alcohols, ethers and furans, which have recently been a hot research subject [28]. Butanol, as a renewable fuel which can be used in internal combustion engines, it can not only act as a co-solvent, but also as an improver of fuel characteristics [29,30]. The relatively higher heat of evaporation can reduce combustion temperature and the formation of NOx. Moreover, the addition of butanol can also reduce PM emissions and can make CO2 reduction [31–33]. Rakopoulos et al. [34,35] studied the effect of n-butanol as a kind of biofuel supplements in both vegetable oil and its biodiesel on cyclic variations, combustion characteristics and emissions balance. Ahmad and Hossain [36] proved, the addition of butanol in the blend with biodiesel made from pure rapeseed oil can improve fuel spray characteristics and fuel properties, such as flash point, kinematic viscosity and gross calorific value. However, the structure effects of co-solvent isomers on the solubilization efficiency were not fully considered. Therefore, several isomers of butanol have been used as representative to study the effect of co-solvent configuration on the solubility in the current study. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) is a water-miscible organic liquid, the viscosity is low at room temperature and pressure. The chemical formula is (CH2)4O and it is a common medium polar non-protonic solvent. Thus, THF is mainly acts as a catalyst for transesterification, which can promote the establishment of the whole fuel system. Kampars et al. [37] used THF as the solvent to investigate the effect in the interesterification reactions of methyl acetate and rapeseed oil under the catalytic action of different catalysts. Khang et al. [38] used tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a co-solvent, combined the function of sulfuric acid catalyst, simplified the step of oil extraction and improved the overall reaction rate. Results indicated the prospects of the application of methanol/THF mixtures in the in-situ transesterification. In summary, THF has a good solvent effect in transesterification which makes its feasible use as co-solvent to promote the mutual solubility between low-carbon alcohols and rapeseed oil. In addition, as fuel additive, THF can reduce the interfacial surface tension of rapeseed oil and methanol, which dramatically reduces the mass transfer limitations [38]. Polyoxymethylene dimethyl ethers (PODE) has low molecular weight acetal polymer with dimethoxymethane as its sub-unit and methylene as its main chain. Its general formula is CH3O (CH2O)nCH3 (n: 3–6), which is used as a blending agent for high quality diesel oil. With the characteristic of high oxygen content and CN, sulfur and aromatics free, PODE can not only act as a blending agent but also a co-solvent in the fuel system [39,40]. Results showed that the combustion stability and efficiency were improved at low load with the addition of PODE. However, few studies were focused on the co-solvent PODE in the blend of rapeseed oil and methanol or ethanol. Considering that the CN of methanol, ethanol and rapeseed oil is relatively lower than that of diesel fuel, PODE addition can improve the CN of the blending fuels. Based on the above literature review, rapeseed oil is one of the main biofuel preparation materials and has a wide range of sources. But the high viscosity limits its direct application. By mixing methanol or ethanol, fuel characteristics can be improved and alcohol fuels themselves can be widely used in diesel engines, but the wider application faces the challenge of mutual solubility. Butanol isomers, THF and PODE have potential to improve the solubility between diesel fuel and low-carbon alcohols as co-solvent fuels. However, few studies on the direct blending of rapeseed oil and methanol or ethanol have been studied. In this work, the blends of rapeseed oil and low-carbon alcohol such as methanol and ethanol were tested at ambient temperatures of 20 °C, 40 °C and 60 °C to investigate their effects on inter-solubility. The blend concentrations of alcohols ranged from 10% to 90% and the increment was set as 10 vol%. The co-solvent was then added into the fuel blend of rapeseed oil and low-carbon alcohol. The inter-solubility between the ternary systems were improved and finally got homogeneous solution. By recording the data when one-phase liquid occurred as the end point, the phase behavior was depicted using the ternary phase diagram. The macro and micro solubility of the blending fuel system were carried out at the same time, which showed the mutual solubility process more intuitively. By expanding the types of vegetable oils and co-solvents, this study can promote the development of biofuels. In addition, by the processing of biomass materials, all the materials in this article, including alcohols, PODE, THF and rapeseed oil can be obtained, which can promote the research progress of renewable alternative fuels."
1,Materials and methods,"Rapeseed oil was produced by Yihaikerry Food Marketing Co., Ltd and PODEn was supplied by Tsingtao Tongchuan Petrochemical Engineering Company. The chemical formula of PODE is CH3O–(CH2O)n–CH3 and the range of n is 3 to 6. N-butanol, iso-butanol, sec-butanol, anhydrous methanol, anhydrous ethanol and THF were in analytical reagent grade pure and were bought from Tianjin Jiangtian Chemical Technology Co., Ltd. Oil Red O (C26H24N4O) with 99.99% purity was bought from Tianjin Mockman Biotechnology Company Limited. It is used as a fat stain in microscopy. The physical and chemical properties of fuels mentioned above are shown in Table 1 . Among these properties, the most obvious difference between diesel fuel and rapeseed oil is kinematic viscosity and the relative data is 2.0–4.5 mm2/s and 30.75 mm2/s, respectively. Hydrophile-Lipophile Balance (HLB) value pioneered by Griffin in 1949 explains the equilibrium relationship between hydrophilic and lipophilic groups in surfactant molecules [41]. The HLB values of nonionic surfactants can also be calculated by some empirical formulas, such as the calculation of HLB value by structural factor method as shown in formula 1 [41]: (1) HLB = 7 + ∑ H - ∑ L where ∑H represents hydrophilic radical and ∑L represents lipophilic radical. The HLB values of nonionic surfactants are additive, so the formula 2 is used to calculate the HLB values of more than one surfactant: (2) HL B AB = HL B A ∗ W A + HL B B ∗ W B / W A + W B where WA denotes the amount of surfactants A and WB denotes the amount of surfactants B. HLBA and HLBB denote the HLB values of the corresponding surfactants. HLBAB denotes the total HLB values. The blend of rapeseed oil with ethanol or with methanol was unstable and phase separation appeared due to the significant difference of carbon content and polarity. However, the addition of some co-solvents, such as butanol isomers (n-butanol, iso-butanol and sec-butanol), THF and PODE, could improve this situation. These co-solvents were gradually added into the blends and the data was recorded as soon as the phase boundaries disappeared. Furthermore, the blend became a stable ternary blend fuel system whose phase behavior could be depicted by the ternary phase diagrams. The alcohol concentrations in the blend were set from 10% to 90%, with the increment of 10 vol%. An initial volume of 5 mL was used to establish the basic blends of rapeseed-oil/ethanol and rapeseed-oil/methanol within the centrifuge tube. A vortex mixer with a rotating capacity of 5000 revolution per minute was used to stir the blends in the tube, for a well mixing of the blending system. Fig. 1 shows macro and micro solubility observation on the change of phase boundary of methanol and rapeseed with 1:1 in volume. As shown in Fig. 1(a), both methanol and rapeseed oil present two-phase liquids due to poor mutual solubility. At first, the density of methanol is lower than rapeseed oil, it floats in the upper layer. As shown in Fig. 1(b), after 20 s of full oscillation using vortex, the blend gradually returns to turbid liquid. Then, left-standing for about 30 s, the turbid liquid gradually returns to the stratified state as shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d). Finally, the stratified recovery state eventually becomes two-phase liquid again within 5 min. Moreover, a bio-microscopy (OLYMOUS CX31RTSF) was used to observe the phase separation at room temperature of the fuel system under microscopic conditions and Oil Red O was used to dye the rapeseed oil into red color. The blends were held in a digital constant temperature incubator with a precision of 0.1 °C for least 30 min to maintain the stable system temperature. Three test temperatures including 20 °C, 40 °C and 60 °C were set to study the effect of temperature on the ternary system. Then, the co-solvents were gradually added using a high-precision pipette with a precision of 0.1 μL until the occurrence of stable and clear one-phase liquid as macro solubility observation shown in Fig. 1(f). It can be observed that, with the addition of co-solvents, the height of phase boundary gradually increased, that is to say, part of the methanol dissolved into the rapeseed oil. In the course of microscopic observation, a pipette was used to extract 10 μL samples from the layered interface of rapeseed-oil/methanol or rapeseed-oil/ethanol and drop them onto the slide. The samples were observed under the optical microscope of 40X and 100X, respectively. The microscopic observations of the miscible fuel system are shown in Fig. 1(g), a stable single phase was also observed under a 100X magnification microscope. The corresponding layered two-phase images were presented in the subsequent analysis. The data of the end point of the co-solvent addition was recorded and the ternary diagram was developed. In this process, an appropriate vortex was used to efficiently mix the ternary systems. The average of the total random arranged three replicates was calculated and adopted for accuracy. To ensure that the final ternary system was stable, 2 days observations were conducted to affirm the end point of each system."
2,Results and discussions,
3,Different surfactant types on fuel blend,"3.1 Different surfactant types on fuel blend In this part, the differences between rapeseed-oil/methanol and rapeseed-oil/ethanol in the mutual solubility of fuel blend are studied together. Fig. 2 presents the microscopic structure and the schematic diagrams of rapeseed-oil/methanol and rapeseed-oil/ethanol. As can be seen in Fig. 2(a) and (b), the 8.425 HLB value of methanol is greater than that of ethanol, thus the relative weaker lipophilicity of methanol. When the sample is vortexed and then dripped onto the slide, the oil quickly converges into a large rose red oil drop, and the internal methanol (transparent color) quickly moves out to the boundary of methanol and oil within 1 min. The methanol outside the boundary diffuses rapidly due to its high fluidity and volatilize because there is no cover slide, leaving only small droplets of alcohol. The microscopic observations of phase separation process are shown in Fig. 2(e)–(h) and the interval between shots is 5 s. As results shown in Fig. 2(e)–(h), a very small amount of methanol is encapsulated by rapeseed oil droplets after stirring with vortex, which is due to the low lipophilicity of methanol. Moreover, as the mixture tends to be stable, small droplets of methanol inside the oil droplets move outward and only a small amount eventually exists on the oil side as shown in the circle in Fig. 2(h). Generally speaking, the phase boundary between methanol and rapeseed oil is very clear and stable, so the mutual solubility of methanol and rapeseed oil is very weak. However, without a cover slide, most of methanol outside the boundary gradually evaporates and accumulates around the relatively large droplet of rapeseed oil in the form of small droplets. The microscopic observation and schematic diagram of ethanol and rapeseed oil are shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d). The HLB value of ethanol is 7.95, which is lower than that of methanol. Thus, ethanol has relatively stronger lipophilicity than methanol, which means ethanol should have the stronger oil solubility. As shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d), ethanol disperses rapeseed oil into relatively small droplets due to its relatively higher lipophilicity compared with methanol. At the same time, the whole mixed droplets disperse better on the slide. However, the high volatility of ethanol leads to its rapid volatilization on the slide and leaves a gap between the oil droplets. Fig. 2(i)–(l) show the microscopic observations of phase separation process of ethanol and rapeseed oil and the interval between shots is 5 s. Ethanol and rapeseed oil gradually disperse when the vortexed mixture of an equal amount of ethanol and rapeseed oil is added to the slide. Most oil converge in the middle because of its relatively poor solubility with ethanol. However, there is an obvious transition trend near the boundary between ethanol and rapeseed oil. A small portion of rapeseed oil is dispersed into smaller droplets and surrounded by ethanol because of the certain degree of lipophilicity of ethanol. Thus, some small droplets gradually converge at the ethanol-oil boundary. The remaining ethanol spreads rapidly outside the boundary because of its high fluidity. It can be inferred that ethanol system is a relatively high dispersed state, which is more likely to promote the mutual solubility of ternary fuel system. In summary, considering that ethanol can disperse oil droplets more effectively, it is conducive for the process of mutual solubility of the whole system."
4,Difference on the effects of butanol isomers on phase stability,"3.2 Difference on the effects of butanol isomers on phase stability In this part, several butanol isomers were chosen to study the effect of various configurations of n-butanol, iso-butanol and sec-butanol on the miscibility of lower-carbon alcohol and rapeseed oil. The results are shown in the form of ternary phase diagrams in Fig. 3 (a–c) for methanol systems and in Fig. 3(d–f) for ethanol systems. As shown in Fig. 3, the addition proportion of co-solvent is gradually increased until a peak appears. In other words, to realize the one-phase liquid in the ternary system, the maximum addition appeared at 7:3 alcohol/rapeseed-oil. Although the values of different butanol isomers are different, the positions of peak values are the same. This is because when the volume proportion of methanol or ethanol in the blend is relatively low, methanol or ethanol gradually disperses into rapeseed oil which occupies the main part with the help of co-solvent. Therefore, with the increase of the proportion of low-carbon alcohol, the amount of co-solvent addition is also increasing. However, with the increasing proportion of low-carbon alcohol, methanol or ethanol gradually occupies the dominant position in the blend. When the ratio of methanol/rapeseed-oil or ethanol/rapeseed-oil exceeds 7:3, the dispersing ability of low-carbon alcohol in the blend with rapeseed oil is strong enough due to less rapeseed oil. That is, rapeseed oil gradually disperses into methanol or ethanol which occupies the main part with the help of co-solvent. Thus, the demand for co-solvent is also correspondingly reduced and the ternary system is easier to achieve mutual solubility. Moreover, it can also be seen in Fig. 3 that the addition proportions of three isomers are quite different even though those isomers can maintain the ternary system as one-phase liquid. Results also show that the addition of all of the tested co-solvents can realize a stable one-phase in the fuel blend of rapeseed oil with methanol or with ethanol. N-butanol has the best solubility among three butanol isomers. The blank region represents the one-phase liquid of the ternary system, while the gray area represents for the phase separation region. The inter-miscible area of the blank region has been calculated and the result is listed in Table 2 . The inter-miscible area of the ternary system of n-butanol, methanol and rapeseed oil at 20 °C is defined as 1. Therefore, the single value demonstrates the solubility difference in ternary system. The higher the value is, the better the inter-solubility of the system. It can be seen from Table 2 that, the inter-solubility of n-butanol is the largest among the three isomers at the testing temperatures. Taking the ternary system on butanol isomers, rapeseed oil and methanol at 20 °C for instance, the values of M + I + R and M + S + R are 0.24 and 0.11 lower than that of M + N + R, respectively. Taking the ternary system on butanol-isomers/rapeseed-oil/ethanol for instance, when the ambient temperature is 20 °C, the addition of sec-butanol and iso-butanol are 6.6% and 25.5% more than that of n-butanol, respectively. The most prominent difference among these three kinds of butanol is the chain structure. With a straight chain, n-butanol has lower 〈r2〉/〈s2〉 value than the isomers with branched chain. This value is squared end-to-end distance divided by squared radius of gyration and the higher value indicates the likelihood of spherical shape of the molecule [34]. Thus, a lower 〈r2〉/〈s2〉 value represents a more linear structure. However, with the higher 〈r2〉/〈s2〉 value, the spherical molecular structure of sec-butanol or iso-butanol has larger surface than that of n-butanol, which makes it relatively less suitable to merge with the rapeseed oil or the low-carbon alcohols [42]. That is to say, n-butanol is a better co-solvent with a more superior solubility performance among the testing isomers. In addition, the value of the system contained ethanol is higher than that contained methanol, for example, the values of the inter-miscible area for E + N + R, E + S + R and E + I + R are 0.51, 0.53 and 0.40 higher than of methanol system at the ambient temperature of 20 °C. The main reason for this difference is that as a medium polar solvent, the polarity of n-butanol is lower than that of polar solvent, such as ethanol and methanol [43]. Thus, the polarity differences between n-butanol and low-carbon alcohols are significantly smaller than that between rapeseed oil and low-carbon alcohols. N-butanol can merge with the rapeseed oil relatively easier compared with ethanol and methanol. With the continuous add of n-butanol into the blend of rapeseed oil and low-carbon alcohols, the amphiphilic property of n-butanol can reduce the surface tension of the blend of low-carbon alcohols and rapeseed oil and eventually realize solubilization. Because the polarity of ethanol is slightly weaker than that of methanol, its polarity is closer to that of n-butanol. According to the similar compatibility principle, n-butanol and ethanol are more soluble. As a result, the blend of rapeseed oil and ethanol needs less n-butanol to achieve the mutual solubility than that of the blend of rapeseed oil and methanol. As ambient temperature increasing to 40 °C and 60 °C, the corresponding values of inter-miscible area for M + N + R reached 1.23 and 1.36, respectively. The increase of this value is more obvious in E + N + R, which is 1.92 and 2.31 at the ambient temperature of 40 °C and 60 °C, respectively. Taking 7:3 ethanol/rapeseed-oil for instance, 43.4%, 30.0% and 16.8% n-butanol is needed to keep the stable one-phase liquid at 20 °C, 40 °C and 60 °C, respectively. The addition proportion of n-butanol at 40 °C and 60 °C decreased 44% and 74% compared to that of 20 °C, respectively. Thus, the proportion of co-solvent added decreased sharply as the ambient temperature increased. It should be noted that alcohols in this study belong to nonionic reagent. In a certain temperature range, alcohols are more easily dissolved in oil system with the increase of temperature. On the contrary, the relative low temperatures make it more capable for dissolving water phase [44]. Therefore, as the temperature increases, n-butanol is easier to merge with the blend of rapeseed oil and low-carbon alcohols. Thus, the higher ambient temperature promotes the faster inter-miscibility of those alcohols and rapeseed oil."
5,The inter-solubility effect of THF on phase stability,"3.3 The inter-solubility effect of THF on phase stability In this part, tetrahydrofuran was firstly blended with rapeseed oil with concentrations from 10% to 90%, with the volume increment of 10 vol%. These blends were observed at the ambient temperatures of 20 °C, 40 °C and 60 °C, respectively. The aim is to study the inter-solubility of rapeseed oil and THF. Result shows that THF is completely miscible with rapeseed oil at all testing blend ratios. Thus, experiments on co-solvent THF application in the blend of rapeseed oil and methanol or ethanol were carried out in the following. As results shown in Fig. 4 , the proportion peaks of THF addition in rapeseed-oil/methanol and rapeseed-oil/ethanol blends appear when the volume ratio of low-carbon alcohols and rapeseed oil is 7:3. The obvious difference between the two blends is that, the peak value of adding THF varies greatly. More specifically, at ambient temperature 20 °C, the proportions of THF in rapeseed-oil/methanol/THF and rapeseed-oil/ethanol/THF are 34.2% and 16.5%, respectively. This rule is consistent with the solubilization effect of isomers of butanol. For example, in the blend of 7:3 ethanol/ rapeseed-oil, the proportion of THF added to achieve the one-phase at 20 °C is 16.5%, as shown in Fig. 4. Moreover, as the ambient temperature increases to 40 °C and 60 °C, the added proportions of THF change to 12.3% and 5.8%, respectively. However, the corresponding demand for n-butanol at 20 °C, 40 °C and 60 °C is 43.4%, 30.0% and 16.8%, respectively. The reason is that THF has a smaller HLB value of 6.4 than n-butanol. When equal volume of THF and n-butanol are added into the blend of low-carbon alcohol and rapeseed oil respectively, according to the above formula (2), the HLB value of THF mixed with low-carbon alcohol will be lower than that of n-butanol mixed with low-carbon alcohol. Therefore, when THF is mixed with low-carbon alcohol, the mixture has higher lipophilicity than that of n-butanol and low-carbon alcohol. This means that rapeseed oil is easier to dissolve into THF because of its higher oil tolerance. Moreover, THF is composed of cyclic saturated alkanes, which indicates that THF has strong hydrogen bonding capacity and high polarity [45,46]. The polarity of THF is stronger than n-butanol, but weaker than ethanol and methanol [47]. As a common organic solvent, THF has good mutual solubility with rapeseed oil. Therefore, it is easy to merge with rapeseed oil. Meanwhile, the amphiphilicity of THF between low-carbon alcohol and rapeseed oil is better than that of butanol and its isomers. Therefore, THF can reduce the surface tension of the system more significantly and then promote the mutual solubility of the ternary system. Thus, when the content of rapeseed oil and low-carbon alcohol is constant, less THF is needed to realize the mutual solubility of the system. THF has the better solubilization ability than butanol."
6,The inter-solubility effect of PODE on phase stability,"3.4 The inter-solubility effect of PODE on phase stability In this part, PODE was used in rapeseed-oil/methanol and rapeseed-oil/ethanol. It has been verified by experiments that PODE was completely miscible with rapeseed oil at all testing blend ratios. The inter-solubility of PODE on rapeseed-oil/methanol and rapeseed-oil/ethanol system were studied at 20 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C, respectively. In ternary system, the addition ratio of PODE at different alcohol-oil ratios and temperatures are shown in Fig. 5 . Results show that the proportion of PODE increases with the increasing alcohol ratio in the blend. When low-carbon alcohol to rapeseed oil is 7:3, a peak value appears, and then the proportion of PODE decreases. In addition, less PODE is needed in the system with ethanol. In general, when the HLB is between 8 and 14, the system is relatively hydrophilic and the alcohol is an external continuous phase, while the rapeseed oil enters the alcohol through mutual dissolution. Also, when the HLB is lower than 8, the system is relatively lipophilic, in which rapeseed oil is the external continuous phase and alcohol disperses and dissolves the rapeseed oil [48]. For example, combined with the dissolution model mentioned above, the dissolution process of methanol system is slower than that of ethanol system, which proved that the lower HLB value is more conducive to the mutual solubility of the system. Thus, according to the formula (2), the HLB value is always less than 8 when THF combines with low carbon alcohols, THF is easy to disperse and dissolve the external continuous phase of rapeseed oil. At the same time, rapeseed-oil/methanol blend needs more THF than rapeseed-oil/ethanol blend. However, the HLB value of PODE (10.58) is the highest means that PODE has the weakest lipophilicity among the five co-solvents in this paper. The experimental results also show that in order to achieve the mutual solubility of the system, the added proportion of PODE is always higher than n-butanol and THF in the ternary system with methanol. In the ternary system with ethanol, the added proportion of PODE is higher than THF but lower than n-butanol. Taking low-carbon alcohol to rapeseed oil is 7:3 at 20 °C for instance, 61.54% and 26.58% PODE, 58.83% and 43.44% n-butanol are needed to realize the mutual solubility of the ternary system with methanol and ethanol, respectively. These data suggest that the effect of PODE in ethanol system is outstanding, which is not consistent with the HLB value. This may be related to the diversity of carbon chain length contained in PODE as a mixture. The components with longer carbon chain are more soluble with rapeseed oil, while the components with shorter carbon chain are more soluble with ethanol. As a result, the ternary system of rapeseed oil, ethanol and PODE has better mutual solubility. The specific reasons need further research."
7,Density and viscosity adjustment of the fuel system,"3.5 Density and viscosity adjustment of the fuel system The kinematic viscosity range of traditional diesel fuel is 2.0–4.5 mm2/s at 40 °C. In order to make the viscosity of the blend meet the requirements of the diesel engine within different volume ratios of either methanol or ethanol at 40 °C, the optimum mixture of the ternary system is shown in Fig. 6 (a). That is, 30–40% M, 30–40% THF and 25–40% R; 30–45% M, 35–40% n-butanol and 15–30% R; 30–40% M, 35–40% PODE and 20–35% R in the ternary system with methanol. The above results show that the solubilization of n-butanol or PODE can be achieved with a relatively smaller THF ratio under the same proportion of low-carbon alcohols. The reason is that, tetrahydrofuran itself has a relatively lower viscosity, so it is more dominant in the process of blending viscosity. Moreover, PODE has relatively moderate viscosity among them, therefore, the effect of its viscosity improvement is between n-butanol and THF. Fig. 6(b) presents the optimum mixture of the ternary system with ethanol is 30–40% E, 35–40% THF and 25–35% R; 40–60% E, 30–35% n-butanol and 10–25% R; 30–40% E , 35–40% PODE and 20–35% R. The proportion of rapeseed oil in the ternary system containing ethanol is significantly lower as compared to the system containing methanol at the same proportion of co-solvent addition. This is because at 40 °C, the viscosity of ethanol is 1.13 mm2/s, higher than 0.58 mm2/s of methanol, as a result, the ethanol effect on blending viscosity is not as that of methanol. The density range of traditional diesel fuel is 0.81–0.845 mm2/s at 20 °C. In order to make the blending density meet the requirements of the diesel engine, the optimum mixture of the ternary system with methanol is 50–80% M, 15–45% THF and 5–10% R; 35–50% M, 35–40% n-butanol and 10–35% R; 70–85% M, 10–25% PODE and 5% R, as shown in Fig. 6(c). Because of the higher density of THF than butanol, the ability of THF to achieve density harmonization is weaker than that of n-butanol under the same blending ratio. Moreover, PODE has relatively high density, which leads to that the same proportion of PODE only blend less rapeseed oil compare to butanol isomers in the process of density regulation. It is worth mentioning that relatively high density can improve engine power. At the same time, as the addition of low-carbon alcohol decreases the CN of the ternary system, the high CN of PODE also makes it predominant in several co-solvents studied in this paper. Thereby, CN of PODE system can be adjusted appropriately than that of THF and butanol, meanwhile a higher fuel density ensures a better engine power to some extent. Besides, the optimum mixture of the ternary system with ethanol is 55–80% E, 15–35% THF and 5–10% R; 30–60% E, 30–35% n-butanol and 10–35% R; 70–85% E, 10–25% PODE and 5% R, as shown in Fig. 6(d). Compared with the ternary system containing methanol, rapeseed oil with the same proportion of solubilization in the ternary system containing ethanol needs fewer co-solvents. In conclusion, tetrahydrofuran is superior to n-butanol and PODE in solubilizing ability and has higher efficiency in adjusting viscosity, while PODE is better to obtain appropriate CN and higher fuel density."
8,Comparisons of solubilization effects of soybean oil and rapeseed oil systems,"3.6 Comparisons of solubilization effects of soybean oil and rapeseed oil systems The former study was focused on the solubilization effect on the ternary system with soybean oil [42]. The comparisons of solubilization effects were carried out to investigate whether there is a difference between the ternary system of rapeseed oil and soybean oil. As shown in Fig. 7 (a), when ethanol to vegetable oil is 7:3 at 20 °C, the comparisons of solubility of five solvents in the ternary system of two vegetable oils are consistent. N-butanol with straight chain structure has better solubilization ability than other branched-chain butanol. But the solubility of n-butanol is lower than that of PODE and THF in turn. The proportion of n-butanol in the fuel system with soybean oil and rapeseed oil is 31.5% and 43.4%, respectively. To make the ternary system achieve one-phase liquid, 20.5% and 26.6% PODE are needed for the ternary system with either soybean oil or rapeseed oil, respectively. Moreover, the corresponding THF proportion is 12.3% and 16.5% for the ternary system with either soybean oil or rapeseed oil, respectively. By comparing the fatty acid composition of rapeseed oil and soybean oil methyl esters [49] as shown in Fig. 7(b), the main difference between them is that the erucic acid content of rapeseed oil is as high as 49.8%, while soybean oil does not contain erucic acid. The content of oleic acid in rapeseed oil is significantly lower than that of soybean oil, but the content of linoleic acid is relatively higher than that of soybean oil. Finally, there is another major fatty acid in soybean oil, palmitic acid, which is 14.17%. It should be noted that the content of vegetable oil methyl ester is different from that of vegetable oil because the methyl esters as shown in Fig. 7(b) are derived from the production of transesterification. However, the composition of fatty acids as esterification substrates can be considered to be the consistent [50]. Among them, the carbon chain length of palmitic acid is 16, and it is soluble in ethanol, slightly soluble in petroleum ether. The carbon chain lengths of oleic acid and linoleic acid are 18. Erucic acid has the longest carbon chain of 22 and it is hard to be soluble in methanol and ethanol. Therefore, according to the principle of similar miscibility, the polarity of short-chain fatty acids is closer to the isomers of butanol, PODE and THF, resulting in better mutual solubility. In conclusion, the large proportion of long-chain erucic acid in rapeseed oil is the main reason for the need of more co-solvents than the ternary system containing soybean oil."
9,Conclusion,"The usage of co-solvents is necessary to improve the poor mutual solubility and fuel characteristics of the blend of rapeseed oil and low-carbon alcohols. There are only a few studies on the co-solvents of the blending properties of vegetable oil. In fact, it is necessary to study the promotion of mutual solubility of vegetable oil and low-carbon alcohol fuel systems by various co-solvents. Therefore, in the current study, different co-solvents including butanol isomers, PODE and THF were added into the blends of rapeseed oil and methanol or rapeseed oil and ethanol. The macro and micro phase behaviors in blending fuel systems were observed. Some conclusions can be drawn as follows. (1) The macro and micro solubility observations show that the mutual solubility of methanol and ethanol with rapeseed oil is not good. In macroscopic observation, the poor mutual solubility shows obvious stratification phenomenon. With the gradual addition of co-solvent, the position of the phase boundary increases due to low-carbon alcohol dissolved into rapeseed oil, which finally appears as a stable and uniform one-phase liquid in microscopic observation. The microscopic observations of the corresponding system also show that methanol and rapeseed oil delaminate rapidly after mixing, and eventually form a clear and smooth interface. However, when ethanol is mixed with rapeseed oil, most ethanol and rapeseed oil gradually resume stratification, but at the interface, a small amount of rapeseed oil is separated into droplets by ethanol, showing a transitional boundary trend. This is due to the fact that the lipophilicity of ethanol is relatively higher than that of methanol. (2) Generally speaking, the solubilization effect of THF is the best among the co-solvents studied in this paper. Compared with n-butanol, PODE is more suitable for ethanol system rather than for methanol system. At the same time, the proper increase of temperature can promote the solubilization ability of these co-solvents. According to the solubilization effect and the improvement of fuel properties, such as viscosity and density, the proper proportion of ternary fuel can be adjusted to meet the requirements of the corresponding fuel characteristics and the blending fuel can be completely soluble. (3) Finally, compared with soybean oil ternary system, rapeseed oil system needs more co-solvents due to the difference of fatty acid composition and content."
