0,Introduction,"In the past decades, the biomass-based diesel has attracted a great deal of attention as an alternative energy [1,2], and various studies have shown that pollutant emissions from biodiesel were significantly reduced relative to conventional fossil fuels [3–6]. To meet the requirements of future legislation, emissions from combustion need to be reduced by improving the combustion process and using bio-fuels with oxygenated compounds. Some typical alternative fuels, such as anisole, benzyl alcohol and 2-phenyl ethanol are derived from lignin [7]. Among these compounds, 2-phenylethanol and anisole have been investigated in terms of kinetic mechanisms. Sakai et al. [8] had obtained a reasonable subset of 2-phenylethanol pyrolysis to form toluene and styrene by using the CBS-QB3 calculations. Singh et al. [9] conducted an experimental and theoretical study on the pyrolysis of 2-phenylethanol at high temperature using a shock tube and reported the formation of benzene, ethylbenzene and benzaldehyde. Nowakowska et al. [10] studied the oxidation and pyrolysis of anodic acid with a Jet-Stirred Reactor (JSR) at equivalent ratio (Φ) of 1.0 and extended the combustion model of light aromatic compounds to anisole. It is worth noting that A1CH2OH was considered in the sub-mechanism of anisole. Compared to 2-phenylethanol and anisole, detailed kinetic studies of A1CH2OH oxidation are still lacking, although it exhibits a comparable performance to these fuels. Zhou et al.’s [7,11–14] studies showed that the oxygenated fuels resulting in a significant reduction in particulate matter emissions and improve engine efficiency comparing with the traditional diesel. Particularly, A1CH2OH was observed to have the best performance among all the studied aromatic oxygen-containing compounds taking both efficiency and emissions into account. However, the kinetic understanding for the good performance of A1CH2OH is still unclear and the microscopic combustion process of benzyl alcohol can better explain the advantages and merits of the performance of benzyl alcohol in internal-combustion engine. So, further study of A1CH2OH is highly desirable. On the other hand, Narayanaswamy et al. [15] developed an oxidation mechanism of A1CH2OH, which considered the OH bond breaking of A1CH2OH and subsequent reactions. Husson et al. [16] considered the α CH cleavage of A1CH2OH to produce A1CHOH radicals in ethylbenzene oxidation. In addition, Herbinet et al. [17] suggested that the mechanism of oxidation of benzene and toluene contained some reactions of A1CH2OH. However, these sub-mechanisms have not been validated due to the absence of experimental data and accurate rate constants. Therefore, it is necessary to study the chemical reaction mechanism of A1CH2OH to explain their excellent performance in the engines, especially in the engine part loads at medium speed. This work aims to investigate the low-temperature oxidation of A1CH2OH at 700-1100 K, 1 atm at Φ of 0.4 and 2.0 using a JSR equipped with GC and GC-MS. Compared with the work of Narayanaswamy et al. [15], rate constants of A1CH2OH decomposition, ipso-addition with OH, CH3 atom, a bimolecular initiation with O2, H-abstractions of A1CH2OH by H, OH and HO2 as well as H-abstraction of A1CHO were updated. Based on measured and calculated results, a detailed chemical kinetic model was developed to validate the speciation profiles and reveal the reaction pathways at 700-1100 K. The results will guide the kinetic understanding of A1CH2OH for future applications."
1,Experimental,"The low-temperature oxidation of A1CH2OH was carried out in a home-made JSR with a volume of 65 cm3. The details of the experimental setup and procedure can be found elsewhere [18,19] and only a brief description is given here. The inlet concentration of A1CH2OH is 0.5% and that of oxygen is 10.60% and 2.13% diluted in Ar, corresponding to Φ of 0.4 and 2.0, respectively. The total flow rate was 1.0 standard liter per minute. A1CH2OH was fed into a vaporization tank kept at 230°C by a high-pressure infusion pump. The flow rate of oxygen and argon was controlled by a mass flow controller with an uncertainty of ±5%. In order to reduce temperature gradient, all the gas was preheated to 230°C before and after JSR. The temperature of the JSR was controlled by the heating controller (HT60) and measured by a K-type thermocouple. The outlet gases were analyzed by an online GC (Agilent 7890B) and GC/MS (Agilent 7890B-5977A). Thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to analyze and detect H2, CO, CO2 and CH4. Flame Ionization Detector (FID) combined with Al2O3-KCl and HP-INNWax columns were used to analyze the light hydrocarbons and aromatic intermediates. A calibration with standard gas was conducted before measurement. Good reproducibility was obtained by at least three measurements at each temperature. FID has a detection threshold of 0.1 ppm and a TCD detection threshold of 10 ppm. The average values were used as the final data, with the measured errors being ±5% for major species land ±10% for minor ones, respectively. The uncertainties of the temperatures, mainly coming from the limited accuracy of the experimental setup, are estimated to be ±5 K."
2,Kinetic modeling,"The modeling was performed using the PSR code of Chemkin-Pro software [20]. The mechanism is based on our recent work on n-propylbenzene [21], trimethylbenzene [22,23] by adding subset of A1CH2OH and derived radicals as well as considering the new C2 mechanisms [18]. In the temperature range of 700-1100 K, the rates of the unimolecular reactions are lower than those of metatheses reactions. Moreover, the dissociation energy of C6H5CH2 OH bond is 81.3 ± 1.8 kcal/mol [24,25], which is lower than that of the C6H5 CH2OH bond, 98.8 ± 1.3 kcal/mol [24]. Thus, the importance of these reactions would be more significant in pyrolysis than the current oxidation conditions. The complete mechanism consists of 304 species and 1903 reactions. The rate-of-production (ROP) and sensitivity analysis were performed to track the key reaction pathways governing A1CH2OH consumption and production of intermediates. The primary mechanism of A1CH2OH, including unimolecular decomposition, bimolecular initiation, ipso-addition and metatheses, is listed in Table 1 . Figure 1 shows the rates of reactions of A1CH2OH and H/OH radicals calculated by the quantitative calculation and those estimated from the mechanism of Husson et al.'s work [16]. From the Fig. 1, rate constants calculated in this work are smaller than that proposed by Husson et al. [16]. Therefore, the use of these reaction constants of Husson et al. [16] to simulate the consumption of benzyl alcohol will cause the temperature-concentration profile to shift toward the low temperature region. Reactions R1 to R5 are unimolecular decomposition reactions of A1CH2OH, giving rise to A1CH2, A1CH2O, A1CHOH and phenyl radicals as well as A1CHO. The rate constant of R1 was estimated from that of radical combination reaction. The rate constant for the unimolecular decomposition via cleavage of OH bond (R2) was taken from the work of Narayanaswamy et al. [15]. For the remaining unimolecular decompositions (R3-R5), the rate constants were deduced from values for the similar reactions in case of iso-butanol, toluene and ethanol, respectively. For the bimolecular reaction, R6, and R10-R13, with transition states, the rate constants at different temperature were calculated based on the density functional theory. The harmonic oscillator assumption was used to derive thermochemical quantities. The standard enthalpies of formation for the molecules have been calculated from atomization energy. The atomization energies were subtracted from the well-known enthalpies of formation of the isolated atoms. The interaction between reactant and bath gas is modeled by the Lennard-Jones potential. The Lennard-Jones pairwise parameters σ = 3.465 Å, ε / k = 78.89 cm−1 for Ar in previous literature [26] are applied to our rate constant calculations. For the Lennard-Jones parameters of the benzyl alcohol, these values are estimated by the following equations: (1) σ = 2.44 ( T c / P c ) 1 / 3 (2) ε A / k b = 0.77 T c In these equations, kb is the Boltzmann constant. The critical temperature and pressure, Tc and Pc for benzyl alcohol are estimated using the method of Joback [26]. According to (1) and (2), the Lennard-Jones parameters we estimated are σ = 5.375 Å, ε / k = 461 . 0 cm−1. Frequency analysis was used to determine the only one imaginary vibration with the mode of vibration corresponding to the reaction coordinate. Geometry parameters (as shown in the supplement material), energies and vibrational frequencies of the reactants, products and the transition states were calculated at CBS-QB3 level [27] performed by Gaussian 16 [28]. Neither hindered rotor treatment nor tunneling effect was considered. CBS-QB3 is a usual method to calculate the rate coefficient of hydrocarbons [19]. It possess the similar accuracy, but with less computational cost, in building PES of small oxygenic hydrocarbons, compared with QCISD (T) method [26]. The rate constant of R9 is estimated from the similar reaction of toluene [32]. As to the bimolecular initiations with oxygen molecules (R6 and R7), rate constant of the reaction giving A1CHOH and HO2 (R6) was calculated in this work and that of the reaction forming A1CH2O and HO2 (R7) was taken from Nowakowska et al.’s work [10]. The rate for the ipso-addition of H to give benzene and CH2OH radical (R8) was taken from Dagaut et al.’s work [29]. As for the remaining reactions (R14-R20), rate constants were deduced from values for the similar reactions in case of iso-butanol [30,31]. It should be mentioned that the newly observed intermediates (benzyl formate, benzyl acetate and phenyl propionate) and their derived species were not considered in the present model due to the lack of accurate rate constants. The secondary mechanism and some newly calculated rate constants with respect to A1CHO are listed in Table 2 , and molecular structures of the species are shown in Table 3 . Reaction R21 is decomposition reactions of A1CHOH, giving rise to A1CHO, and the rate constant for the OH bond dissociation was taken from Husson et al.’s work [10]. Reaction R22 is isomerization of A1CHOH to A1CH2O, and its rate constant was deduced from values for the similar reactions in case of ethanol [23]. The rate constant of the addition of O to benzyl radical (R23) was taken from the work of Narayanaswamy et al. [15]. Reactions R24 to R26 are decomposition reactions of A1CH2O, giving rise to A1CHO, phenyl radicals and benzene. The rate constants were taken from the work of Bozzelli et al. [34]. For the H-abstraction reactions (R27-R29), the rate constants were taken from the work of Narayanaswamy et al. [15]. The rate constant for the reaction of A1CH2O with oxygen (R30) were taken from the work of Bounaceur et al. [35]. Due to the importance of benzaldehyde in the benzyl alcohol oxidation, H-abstraction reactions (R31 and R32) from benzaldehyde with O2 and HO2 were calculated by the quantitative calculation. The molecular structures of the species are shown in Table 3."
3,Results and discussions,"In this work, 19 species, including fuel, main products, light hydrocarbons, aromatic and oxygenated intermediates as well as esters, were detected. Figure 2 shows a representative chromatogram obtained at 925 K under fuel-lean condition. Besides aldehydes and aromatics, several esters were detected in the oxidation of A1CH2OH. It should be noted that these esters have not observed in previous studies of A1CH2OH. In general, the peak concentrations of hydrocarbons and aromatic species are higher in rich condition than those in lean condition, while the peak concentrations of oxygenated species are on the contrary. As to the temperature of peak concentration of all intermediates observed in this work, it is higher in rich condition than that in lean condition."
4,Major species,"4.1 Major species Figure 3 shows the comparison of the experimental and simulation profiles of the major species. In general, the present model predicts the trends of A1CH2OH, CO, CO2 and H2 well. From Fig. 3a, the initial reaction temperature of A1CH2OH is 760 K at Φ=0.4, while this value shifts to 785 K at Φ=2.0. According to the ROP results, H-abstraction to produce A1CHOH is the main consumption pathway of A1CH2OH under both conditions. Particularly, H-abstraction with OH radicals consumes most of the fuel among the four H-abstraction reactions. As the concentrations of OH radicals and O atoms decrease with the increase of Φ, A1CH2OH consumed by H-abstractions becomes less, which leads to the increase of the initial reaction temperature of A1CH2OH oxidation from Φ = 0.4–2.0. CO reaches a peak value of 1.5 × 10−2 at 973 K and 1.5 × 10−2 at 1100 K under lean and rich conditions, respectively. The simulated profiles successfully captured the trend and peak values of CO. At Φ=0.4, CO owns a peak-shaped profile, while it increases with temperature at Φ = 2.0. The peak value of CO2 concentration at Φ = 0.4 is much larger than that at Φ = 2.0. At lean condition, with the consumption of A1CH2OH, the mole concentration of CO decreases whereas that of CO2 increases. H2 only appears in the rich condition at about 856 K and its concentration increases with the temperature and reaching a peak of 4.2 × 10−3 at 1110 K."
5,Intermediates,"4.2 Intermediates The mole fraction profiles of the light hydrocarbons are shown in Fig. 4 . In principle, the simulated results show good agreement with the measured data. From the ROP results, CH4 is mainly produced from the reaction of HO2+C5H5 CH4+CO2+C3H2 (76.46% for ϕ = 0.4 and 62.98% for ϕ = 2.0) and the reactions that CH3 radical captures the H atom from other species. C2H4 is mainly formed by the reactions of OH+C2H3CHOCO2+C2H4+H (34.88% for ϕ = 0.4 and 24.10% for ϕ = 2.0), HO2+C5H5 C2H4+C2H+CO+OH (33.49% for ϕ = 0.4 and 51.97% for ϕ = 2.0) and C5H6+O = C2H4+C2H2+CO (13.22% for ϕ = 0.4 and 10.44% for ϕ = 2.0). C2H6 is mainly formed by the combination reaction of two CH3 radicals (32.81% for ϕ = 0.4 and 60.23% for ϕ = 2.0) and the reactions of C2H5+CH2OC2H6+HCO (30.63% for ϕ = 0.4 and 20.32% for ϕ = 2.0), A1CHO+C2H5=A1CO+C2H6 (14.24% for ϕ=0.4 and 13.39% for ϕ=2.0) and C2H6+O2 C2H5+HO2 (12.02% for ϕ = 0.4 and 4.39% for ϕ = 2.0). C4H4 is formed by the reaction of C5H4O+O = C4H4+CO2 (87.04% for ϕ = 0.4 and 31.10% for ϕ = 2.0), C5H4OC4H4+CO (9.84% for ϕ = 0.4 and 13.78% for ϕ = 2.0) and iC4H5 C4H4+H (0.00% for ϕ = 0.4 and 52.01% for ϕ = 2.0). C3H6 is mainly formed by the reactions of O + C4H6 CO+C3H6 (76.30% for ϕ = 0.4 and 65.00% for ϕ = 2.0) and C3H6+H CH3CCH2+H2 (14.94% for ϕ = 0.4 and 17.43% for ϕ = 2.0). C4H8 is mainly formed by the reactions of SAXC4H7+H(+M)=C4H8 (+M) (62.00% for ϕ = 0.4 and 70.83% for ϕ = 2.0) and aC3H5+CH3(+M)=CH3CCH2(+M) (38.00% for ϕ = 0.4 and 29.17% for ϕ = 2.0). The peak values of C1, C2 and C4 hydrocarbons at rich condition are approximately 4.5, 2.5 and 3 times of those at lean condition, and the corresponding peak temperatures at rich condition are higher than those at lean condition. Such phenomena can be attributed to the fact that C1, C2 and C4 are mostly consumed by O and OH, whose concentrations increase with the decrease of Φ. Compared with C1, C2 and C4, the peak concentration and peak temperature of C3H6 at both conditions are very close, which is due to its major consumption by H atom under both conditions. As shown in Fig. 5 , benzene was observed as the unique aromatic species in the oxidation of A1CH2OH, which reaches its peak concentration at 880 and 855 K at lean and rich condition, respectively. Based on the ROP analysis, the main formation pathway of benzene is the ipso-addition reaction of H atom (A1CH2OH+H = A1+CH2OH), and the main consumption routes are A1+OH=A1-+H2O and A1+O = A1O+H. At Φ=0.4, the concentrations of OH radicals and O atoms are more abundant in the lean condition than those in Φ=2.0, thus these consumption reactions are easier to be occurred. As a result, both the peak temperature and the peak concentration of benzene are relatively lower at the lean condition. Although the production pathways of benzene are the same in the oxidation of A1CH2OH and anisole [10], A1CH2OH leads to more benzene formation as a result of the difference of O atom positions in their molecular structures. Figure 6 shows the mole fraction profiles of the oxygenated intermediates. These species have larger peak values at lean condition than those at rich condition, which are different from the tendencies of the hydrocarbons. The maximum concentration and peak temperature of A1CHO are similar at both conditions. According to the ROP analysis, benzaldehyde is mainly produced by A1CHOH radicals, which is generated from A1CH2OH and is nearly independent of Φ. A1CHO is mainly consumed by reactions with H atom. For other oxygenated species, there are obvious differences with respect to the peak concentrations and peak temperatures at the conditions, which could be due to their sensitive generation and consumption to the concentration of O2. Benzofuran, which can be regarded as a derivative of benzaldehyde, is obtained by the addition reaction of phenoxy and C2H2. Since acrolein is obtained by the reaction of iC4H5 with O2, more acrolein is produced at the lean condition. Moreover, the majority of phenol is formed by the reaction sequence of A1CHO→A1CO→phenyl→AlOO→AlO→AlOH. Accordingly, phenol is mainly produced by the reaction of phenoxy group with HO2 radicals whose concentration is larger and more favorable for phenol production at lean condition than at rich condition. Three esters, namely benzyl formate, benzyl acetate and benzyl propionate were observed in this work, as shown in Fig. 7 . These esters tend to be formed easily under lean condition. Benzyl formate could be formed by the combination of A1CH2O radical and HCO radical or the ipso-addition of benzyl alcohol and HCO radical. It is speculated that the possible formation pathways of benzyl acetate are the combination of A1CH2O radical and CH3CO radical or the ipso-addition of benzyl alcohol and CH3CO radical. The peak concentration of benzyl propionate at lean conditions is at the same level as that of the main oxygenated intermediates (e.g. benzaldehyde or phenol). The formation of esters in a large amount is expected to reduce the generation of soot and NOx emissions from the practical applications such as automotive engines and gas turbines."
6,Sensitivity and ROP analysis,"4.3 Sensitivity and ROP analysis As shown in Fig. 8 , the most sensitive reaction of A1CH2OH consumption is the reaction A1CH2OH+OH=A1CHOH+H2O at rich conditions. Moreover, the reactions promoting the consumption of A1CH2OH dominantly are the H-abstractions with H atom, OH radical and O atom occurring at α position of A1CH2OH as well as the reaction H2O2(+M)=OH+OH(+M). For lean condition, the most sensitive reaction of A1CH2OH consumption is the reaction H2O2(+M)=OH+OH(+M). Besides the above reactions, the consumption of A1CH2OH is also promoted by reaction H + O = O+OH. The reaction A1OH+O2=A1O+HO2 has the greatest inhibiting effect on the consumption of A1CH2OH at both conditions. In Nowakowska et al.’s work [10], it was reported that the unimolecular initiation of anisole producing A1O radicals and the metatheses with H-atom, methyl, and phenoxy radicals showed great promoting effect on the consumption of anisole at 800 K, while the only inhibiting reaction at 800 K is the combination of A1O with H atom. However, the unimolecular initiation of anisole producing A1O become the most promoting reaction at 1000 K. Figure 9 shows the ROP analysis of A1CH2OH oxidation at both lean condition (850 K, 60% conversion) and rich condition (880 K, 60% conversion). The reaction which consuming the most A1CH2OH is the H-abstraction occurring at the α position CH bond of A1CH2OH which produce A1CHOH radicals, accounting for 73.58% of A1CH2OH consumption at lean condition and 69.83% of A1CH2OH consumption at rich condition, respectively. The secondary consumption pathway of A1CH2OH is the ipso-addition by H atom to form benzene, accounting for 20-26%. Besides, a minor channel is the H-abstraction by H, OH, O, O2 and HO2 radicals occurring at the OH bond to generate the A1CH2O radicals. Compared to the A1CH2OH consumption, the ROP analysis of anisole oxidation at 800 K [10] shows that it is mainly consumed by the unimolecular initiation producing A1O and H-abstractions producing A1OCH2 radicals. The conversion pathway of A1CHOH radicals to benzaldehyde consumes 88.42% of A1CHOH at lean condition and 87.81% in rich condition respectively. In addition, a tiny amount of A1CHOH radical will produce A1CH2O radical by isomerization. Then, a majority of A1CH2O radicals is converted to benzaldehyde and the conversion rate is 89.55% at lean condition and 88.27% at rich condition respectively. In the meanwhile, a small amount of A1CH2O radicals removed an HCO radical for producing benzene, the conversion rate of which is 9.34% at lean condition and 10.28% at rich condition, respectively. Accordingly, the formation of intermediates, such as phenol, benzofuran and benzene etc., are directly governing by variations of the equivalence ratios. In anisole oxidation, large amount of anisole produces A1OCH2 via H-abstractions, and completely format A1CH2O after an isomerization [10]. As a result, A1CHO in anisole oxidation is mostly produced in A1CH2O decomposition, which is different in the generation path in A1CH2OH oxidation shown in this work. There are two pathways to consume benzaldehyde, the main one is the H-abstraction to generate A1CO free radicals and the minor one is the ipso-addition reaction with a very small amount of benzaldehyde converting to benzene. Almost all of benzaldehyde is consumed to form A1CO. Then, the A1CO radical form phenyl radical by removing CO. Subsequently, by reacting with O2, phenyl radical is converted to peroxyphenyl radical, which is so unstable as to decompose into phenoxy radical. Phenoxy radical has three main consumption pathways: most phenoxy radicals are converted to phenol, a small amount is converted to iC4H5 free radicals and a tiny amount is converted to benzofuran. The generation of phenol consumes 43.16% of A1O at lean condition and 38.84% of A1O at rich condition. In oxidation process of anisole, the generation path of phenol is as following sequence: anisole→A1O→phenol [10]. iC4H5 radical continue to react with O2 to produce acrolein. Consequently, the oxidation of benzyl alcohol is mainly initiated by H-abstractions involving small molecules (e.g. OH, H, HO2, O and CH3), and both benzaldehyde and phenol are the most important and stable mono-aromatic intermediates in this oxidation process."
7,Carbon balance in the oxidation of A1CH2OH,"4.4 Carbon balance in the oxidation of A1CH2OH From Fig. 10 , both the initial carbon atoms concentration under two equivalent ratios are 3.50%. While the temperature is below 855 K, the two profiles show a downward trend with the rising of temperature, because the reaction of A1CH2OH begins and the observed intermediates have not yet been produced in large quantities. At the rich condition, the concentration of carbon atoms increased gradually from 855 to 933 K due to the intermediates observed in this work began to be produced in a large amount. Then, the carbon atoms concentration gradually declines as the temperature continued to increase from 933 K, because the gradual depletion of benzyl alcohol and the fact that many undetectable intermediates can be stably appear under rich conditions. At the lean condition, when the temperature is from 900 K to 1000 K, the concentration of carbon atoms is stabilized at about 2.60%. It may attribute to the consumption of benzyl alcohol in lean conditions is faster than that in rich conditions as well as the formation of many undetectable intermediates. More importantly, the main oxidation product, CO2, its mole fraction is at 10−2 order, at lean condition is much larger than that at rich condition in the temperature scale of 900-1000 K. Then, with the increase of the temperature, all the intermediates are gradually oxidized to CO2, and finally carbon atoms reached 3.44% at 1100 K."
8,Comparison with anisole oxidation,"4.5 Comparison with anisole oxidation Anisole is an isomer of A1CH2OH with a different functional group. The oxidation of anisole was conducted at equivalence ratio of 1.0 and the inlet concentration of anisole is 0.5% [10]. Figure 11 shows peak concentration comparison about benzene and benzaldehyde in this work and anisole oxidation. As shown in Fig. 11, the peak concentration of benzene in anisole oxidation is very close to that in A1CH2OH oxidation of lean condition while the peak temperature of the former one is nearly 100 K higher than that of the latter one, which indicates that A1CH2OH is easier to produce benzene at the same conditions. According to ROP analysis, both of them will react with H atom via ipso-addition for producing benzene as the main formation pathway to benzene in their oxidation reactions. From the view of the molecular structures, the atom connecting side chain and the benzene ring of A1CH2OH is a carbon atom, while that of anisole is an oxygen atom, so it implies that hydrogen atoms react with A1CH2OH via ipso-addition to produce benzene is easier. The peak values of benzaldehyde produced in A1CH2OH oxidation in both conditions are larger than that produced in anisole oxidation within a relatively narrow temperatures range. In A1CH2OH oxidation, benzaldehyde is mainly generated by the sequence A1CH2OH → A1CHOH → A1CHO, while in the anisole oxidation, benzaldehyde is mainly produced by the sequence anisole → A1OCH2 → A1CH2O → A1CHO. As a result, benzaldehyde is more easily produced in A1CH2OH oxidation. There exists a great difference between the oxidations of A1CH2OH and anisole [10]. The main consumption way on the later one is the generation path of A1OH and A1CHO, which is speculated to be mainly attribute to the different positions of oxygen atoms in their molecular structures."
9,Conclusion,"This work reports the experimental and kinetic study of A1CH2OH oxidation, and a detailed oxidation mechanism of A1CH2OH was developed at 700–1100 K. Benzaldehyde and phenol are the most important and stable mono-aromatic intermediates in the oxidation of A1CH2OH. The behavior of benzaldehyde at both conditions are similar and irrelevant to the addition of oxygen. The reaction A1CH2OH+OH=A1CHOH+H2O has a great promotion to the consumption of A1CH2OH in the rich condition, which the reaction H2O2 OHOH has a great promotion to the consumption of A1CH2OH in the lean condition. The reaction A1OH+O2=A1O+HO2 at both conditions leads to the greatest inhibitory effect on the consumption of A1CH2OH. The H-abstraction with H atom, OH radical, HO2 radical and O atom occurring at the α position CH bond of A1CH2OH which produce A1CHOH radicals is the main consumption channel for the oxidation of A1CH2OH. A comparison between anisole oxidation and A1CH2OH oxidation suggests that benzene is produced easier in A1CH2OH oxidation whereas phenol is produced easier in anisole oxidation due to the different positions of O atom. The experimental data and the corresponding proposed kinetics mechanism will contribute to the understanding of the combustion process of A1CH2OH in details. It will assist the explanations of the excellent performance of A1CH2OH in the engine applications, thereby shedding a light on the further explorations and adaption of the 2nd generation bio-fuels for the practical markets."
