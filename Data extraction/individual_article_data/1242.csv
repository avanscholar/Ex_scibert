0,Introduction,"Fluorinated alcohols are important intermediates used to manufacture many commercial products. Among them, fluorinated sulfonamido alcohols of the type RfSO2NHCH2CH2OH (Rf=C8F17) and perfluoroalkyl ethyl alcohols of the type RfCH2CH2OH (Rf=C4F9–C14F29) are the most important commercially available materials of this class [1–5]. For several decades they have been used to manufacture well-known commercial products such as Scotchguard® and Zonyl® surfactants, and soil, water, and oil repellents. Because products made with perfluorinated chains of length ≥ C8F17 are being phased out of commerce, shorter chain alcohols, for example C6F13CH2CH2OH, have become increasingly important. Methods to prepare perfluoroalkyl ethyl alcohols are rather limited. Currently, all commercial methods of preparation use perfluoroalkyl ethyl iodide intermediates, as shown in Scheme 1 . The most common process to convert these iodides to the alcohols uses oleum, wherein the perfluoroalkyl ethyl iodide is converted to the sulfate ester, which is then hydrolyzed with aqueous sodium sulfite to generate the alcohol [6]. Solvolysis with formamides is a common alternative process, where the perfluoroalkyl ethyl iodide is treated with N-methylformamide to form an intermediate formate ester that is then hydrolyzed to give the desired alcohol. Relatively mild conditions are employed for the hydrolysis process, but the reaction times are long unless forcing conditions are applied. The process also requires solvent and generates up to ca. 10 mol% olefin (RfCHCH2) by-product [7,8]. A recently reported route involves conversion of RfI to a Grignard reagent, followed by reaction with ethylene sulfate at −40°C [9]. While such a route is obviously not commercially viable, it does perhaps indicate a desire for improved routes to these valuable alcohols. Improvements in the overall process could potentially result if a more direct route to these alcohols from the perfluoroalkyl iodide (RfI) were developed. Additional improvements, such as faster reaction rates, improved selectivity, and decreased use of hazardous reagents would also be of practical utility. An alternative process that addresses many of these considerations is depicted in Scheme 2 , where the alcohol is produced by simple hydrogenation of the aldehyde intermediate shown. Catalytic hydrogenation of the aldehyde would be expected to proceed with very high selectivity and at high rates under mild conditions, and catalysts for this transformation are readily available [10,11]. The key step in this process, then, would appear to be production of the intermediate fluoroalkyl acetaldehyde. There is literature precedent for the conversion of RfI to RfCH2CHO, for example fluoroalkyl acetaldehydes of the type CnF2n+1CH2CHO (n>1) were prepared photochemically from perfluoroalkyl iodides and enamines in 10–40% yield (Scheme 3 ) [12]. These fluoroalkyl acetaldehydes have also been prepared by radical addition of RfI to vinyl acetate, mediated by zinc or AIBN, giving 1-acetoxy-1-iodo-2-perfluoroalkylethanes in moderate to good yields [13–16]. This chemistry has been further modified and improved by using either alkali halides or metal oxides to convert the intermediate 1-acetoxy-1-iodo-2-perfluoroalkylethanes (RfCH2CHIOAc) to the desired aldehydes in 50–70% yield (Scheme 4 ) [17]. Radical addition of RfI to vinyl alkyl ethers has also been reported as a route to these fluoroalkyl acetaldehydes. For example, reaction of RfI with ethyl vinyl ether in the presence of arenesulfides or areneselenides gives the 1,1-disubstituted intermediates shown in Scheme 5 ; subsequent treatment with NBS then provides the desired fluoroalkyl acetaldehydes (Scheme 8) [18]. Another reported method is the reaction of RfI with ethyl vinyl ether in the presence of sodium sulfite and sodium bicarbonate (sulfinatodehalogenation, Scheme 6 ) [19–24]. Indeed, quantitative yields in this reaction have been demonstrated by the in situ conversion to, and isolation of, the hydrazone derivatives. It is notable that these authors further report the conversion of these aldehydes to the alcohols using NaBH4 reduction [24]. Comparing these literature methods, photochemistry is not attractive for a large scale commercial process. The routes using vinyl esters are potentially of interest, but they require two reactions steps to obtain the aldehyde. In contrast, the sulfinatodehalogenation reaction possesses some attractive features: direct and high yield aldehyde generation, mild reaction conditions, and inexpensive reagents. Coupled with the anticipated ease and simplicity of the subsequent hydrogenation step, the sulfinatodehalogenation route was therefore considered for further investigation. Herein we report our initial results on this route."
1,Results and discussion,"We first investigated the addition of PFHI (perfluorohexyl iodide, C6F13I) to EVE (ethyl vinyl ether) following the procedure described by Huang and Lü [21–23]. Thus, PFHI, ethyl vinyl ether, Na2S2O4, and NaHCO3 in 1:1 CH3CN/H2O were combined and the reaction was monitored by GC and NMR. Consistent with the literature, GC analysis showed that complete PFHI conversion was achieved within 20min at 5–10°C. The original literature report did not report the direct observation or isolation of the aldehyde products, but instead the isolation of the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone derivatives. In our hands, NMR analysis of the crude product shows two products, assigned as the desired aldehyde C6F13CH2CHO and the hemiacetal C6F13CH2CH(OH)(OEt) (Scheme 7 ); the combined yield of these two species, based on PFHI, is nearly quantitative. Assuming that the hemiacetal reacts as an aldehyde equivalent, the NMR results are consistent with the earlier report, where the hydrazones were obtained in 85–97% isolated yields. Crude aldehyde/hemiacetal was isolated from this reaction mixture by solids removal (filtration) and then simple distillation (vacuum transfer) of the volatiles. This product was then hydrogenated with 5% Ru/C catalyst (3.1MPa, 85°C; non-optimized screening conditions). GC analysis showed conversion of the aldehyde to the desired alcohol C6F13CH2CH2OH, as expected. Surprisingly, however, GC–MS analysis also showed clear evidence of CH3CN hydrogenation, as shown by the presence of EtNH2, Et2NH, Et3N, and C6F13CH2CH2NH2. Alkyl redistribution and scrambling is commonly encountered in nitrile hydrogenation. However, nitrile hydrogenation typically requires much higher temperatures than those employed here [25]. In addition, supported ruthenium catalysts are preferred for the reduction of aldehydes to alcohols but are typically not preferred for nitrile hydrogenation. Palladium-, platinum-, and rhodium-based catalysts are reported to be active for nitrile hydrogenation, but the base metal catalysts nickel and cobalt are the most commonly used. Nitrile hydrogenation is reported to be effective in the temperature range 5–100°C but most literature suggests more forcing conditions and thus a practical range of 80–150°C [26]. Regardless, our experimental results indicate that acetonitrile is an incompatible solvent for this hydrogenation. This conclusion led us to investigate alternative solvents in which to conduct the sulfinatodehalogenation step. Prior reports suggest that appropriate cosolvents for the sulfinatodehalogenation reaction do not necessarily need to be soluble in or miscible with water. For example, both diethyl ether and dichloromethane have been reported as solvents for this reaction [19–24]. However, these were not considered due to their volatility, flammability, and/or toxicity properties [27,28]. The addition of PFHI to EVE was investigated using methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE) as solvent but this was unsuccessful, giving recovery only of unreacted PFHI. Ethanol was found to be a good solvent for the sulfinatodehalogenation step. As observed in with acetonitrile, monitoring the reaction by GC analysis showed rapid and complete PFHI conversion. The resulting product mixture was filtered and the filtrate was subjected to simple vacuum distillation. However, in this case NMR (19F, 1H) analysis of the crude, distilled product showed three, rather than two, fluorine-containing products. Two of these were identified as the expected aldehyde (C6F13CH2CHO) and hemiacetal (C6F13CH2CH(OH)(OEt)) products already discussed. The third product was identified as the diethyl acetal C6F13CH2CH(OEt)2 [29]. Hydrogenation of this mixture gave the desired alcohol and complete aldehyde and hemiacetal conversion, but unreacted C6F13CH2CH(OEt)2 remained; the results of multiple experiments indicate that the acetal is inert to hydrogenation under the conditions tested. Conducting the hydrogenation in the presence of added aqueous H2SO4 in an attempt to convert the diethyl acetal in situ to hemiacetal and/or aldehyde, followed by subsequent hydrogenation to the alcohol, was not successful. These results necessitated the further search for a solvent. THF was next investigated and found to be a suitable co-solvent for both the sulfinatodehalogenation and hydrogenation reactions. Replacing CH3CN with THF in the sulfinatodehalogenation procedure described above gave rapid and quantitative PFHI conversion to the expected aldehyde and hemiacetal mixture, with no apparent loss of rate or yield. Similarly, hydrogenation of this crude product (filtration and simple vacuum distillation, then 5% Ru/C) gave smooth conversion to the alcohol with no by-products. With these positive results in hand, preliminary improvements were investigated. With respect to the sulfinatodehalogenation step, it was found that low temperature is essential. As the temperature was raised above 5–10°C, increasing amounts of a by-product, identified as C6F13H were observed. This species was not detected (<ca. 1mol%) at 5–10°C, but at ambient temperatures (20–30°C) increased to represent a 3–4% yield loss. To minimize solvent use, experiments at higher PFHI/EVE concentrations were conducted. The previous literature reports used dilute solutions, 0.125M [23]. We find that the concentrations can be increased ten-fold (1.25M) with no detrimental impact on yield. However, reaction times to complete PFHI conversion increased significantly with increasing concentration, from ca. 20min to ca. 5h for quantitative PFHI conversion at these concentration extremes. In addition, the resulting product mixture was shifted nearly entirely to the hemiacetal (>90mol% hemiacetal, <10mol% aldehyde) at higher starting reagent concentration. The initial hydrogenation experiments were cursory in nature, and designed simply to demonstrate the desired conversion of the aldehyde/hemiacetal mixture to the target alcohol. With an improved preparation of the aldehyde/hemiacetal in hand, the hydrogenation was similarly studied in further detail. First, detailed analysis of the hydrogenation product showed two impurities, identified as C5F11CFHCH2CH2OH and C6F13CH2CH2OEt. The partially defluorinated alcohol is likely derived by the formal elimination of HF from the aldehyde/hemiacetal to give olefin, followed by hydrogenation, as shown in Scheme 8 . Elimination of HF from aldehydes RfCH2CHO has been reported with bases as weak as pyridine [18]. Our investigations did not show evidence of the formation of olefinic species during the sulfinatodehalogenation step but small amounts of olefin resonances were observed in the 1H NMR of the distilled product prior to hydrogenation. Apparently, the combination of elevated temperature and base (e.g., NaHCO3) are sufficient to give rise to this undesirable species. Removal of excess NaHCO3 and other salts by water extraction sufficed to eliminate this problem. The ether C6F13CH2CH2OEt likely results from hydrogenation of the hemiacetal. Hydrogenation of hemiacetals to ethers is known and is more prone to occur with supported palladium catalysts, which is one reason why we originally chose Ru/C catalyst [30,31]. In an attempt to eliminate, or at least reduce, this undesired product, the hydrogenation was tested in the presence of acid and additional water to ensure rapid equilibration of the hemiacetal and the aldehyde. Assuming that aldehyde hydrogenation is faster than hemiacetal hydrogenation, this strategy should shift the product to the target alcohol. This effort proved successful; hydrogenation of the aldehyde/hemiacetal mixture in the presence of dilute aqueous H2SO4 (soluble acid) or water plus Amberlyst® 15 (solid acid) resulted in complete hydrogenation of the mixture to the alcohol and elimination of the ether byproduct. With the solvent issues seemingly resolved other parameters were briefly investigated. First examined was the use of nickel catalysts. Raney nickel is commonly used for aldehyde hydrogenation. However, Raney nickel is very basic and this is borne out by the formation of products resulting from formal elimination of HF such as C5F11CF=CHCH2OH and C5F11CFHCH2CH2OH. Raney nickel also produced substantial amounts of the ether C6F13CH2CH2OCH2CH3. Because Raney nickel is incompatible with aqueous acid, which eliminated the ether formation in the case of the Ru/C catalyst, it was dropped from consideration. Raney cobalt catalysts are also used for aldehyde hydrogenation but will likely suffer from the same issues as with Raney nickel, and we have not yet examined them in this system. Finally, although the initial scouting experiments were conducted at 3MPa, we have found that with Ru/C catalyst the hydrogenation proceeds quickly and in high yield at pressures and temperatures as low as 1MPa and 22°C, respectively. In summary, we have demonstrated a new route to commercially important perfluoroalkyl ethyl alcohols. Further work is obviously required to translate these findings to a true commercial process. However, at this point the optimum conditions appear to involve the following steps: 1) sulfinatodehalogenation at 5–10°C in THF/H2O and 1–1.5M reagent concentration; 2) water extraction and optional distillation of the intermediate perfluoroacetaldehyde/hemiacetal mixture; 3) low pressure/low temperature (0.9MPa, 20–30°C) hydrogenation in the presence of aqueous acid; 4) recovery of the product perfluoroalkyl ethyl alcohol in excellent yield by distillation. Further studies are in progress. For example, we have extended this chemistry to other perfluoroalkyl ethyl alcohols such as C3F7OCF2CF2CH2CH2OH."

3,General considerations,"3.1 General considerations The reagents Na2S2O4, NaHCO3, solvents, Ru/C (5%) and Amberlyst® 15 were obtained from Aldrich Chemical Company, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Perfluorohexyliodide (C6F13I) was obtained from the Chemours Company, Wilmington, DE. Hydrogenation reactions were conducted in a custom reactor of Hastelloy C construction. A magnetic stir bar of length matching that of the diameter of the reactor bottom was used for mixing. This design ensured to the greatest degree possible that the heterogeneous catalyst would be fluidized during the experiment. After loading with reagents and sealing the reactor was pressure tested with nitrogen and then pressurized with hydrogen. The reactor was brought to the target reaction temperature using an external heating block with integrated magnetic stirrer. Upon reaching the target temperature additional hydrogen was added as required for the experiment. Reaction progress was monitored by pressure drop using a pressure transducer with digital readout. Products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) using flame ionization (FID) and mass spectral (MS) detection. Product distributions are given as area percent from the FID and are not corrected for response factors."

NaHCO3 (1.4equiv.) is added to the reaction mixture, followed by addition of Na2S2O4 (1.4equiv). Reaction progress is monitored by GC and/or 19F NMR, and is generally complete in 3–5h as judged by the complete disappearance of RfI. The reaction mixture was filtered while cold. Water is added to the filtrate, the lower layer is separated. This layer consists primarily of a mixture of aldehyde C6F13CH2CHO and hemiacetal C6F13CH2CH(OH)(OEt), containing THF and some water.
