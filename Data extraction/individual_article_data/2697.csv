0,Introduction,"In an anaerobic treatment, organic pollutants are first converted to hydrogen, along with volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols. The intermediate metabolites are further degraded by methanogens and are then converted into methane with chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction. Anaerobic digesters were once thought to produce hydrogen gas in small amounts; however, this only appeared to be the case because methanogens quickly utilize hydrogen to produce methane (Archer et al., 1986; Huang et al., 2000; Kidby and Nedwell, 1991; Voolapalli and Stuckey, 2001). A two-phase anaerobic digestion system was first proposed by Pohland and Ghosh (1971). The system refers to the development of unique acid-formers and methane-formers in two separate reactors (Azbar and Speece, 2001; Demirel and Yenigun, 2002; Fox and Pohland, 1994). In such a system, only slow-growing acidogens are found in the first phase and involve the production of VFAs, while slow-growing acetogens and methanogens are found in the second phase, in which VFAs are converted to mainly methane and carbon dioxide. The acidogenic phase can also produce hydrogen as a by-product. Few studies have focused on recovering mostly hydrogen gas, instead of methane, during the anaerobic conversion process. Hydrogen gas is an ideal fuel source and produces no greenhouse gases. Combustion of hydrogen in automobiles is 50% more efficient than gasoline, since hydrogen can be combusted very lean, and gasoline must rely on stoichiometric mixtures and catalytic control of the exhaust gases for emission control (Mizuno et al., 2000; Swain et al., 1983; Van Ginkel et al., 2001). In addition, hydrogen has the ability to be stored compactly as a metallic hydride, and water is its only combustion by-product (Billings, 1991; Lay, 2001). Many believe that using hydrogen as an alternative energy source may replace fossil fuels. Hydrogen can be produced by electrolysis and thermal decomposition of water from non-fossil fuel source, but these processes are more costly when compared to methods (e.g., steam reforming of natural gas) that utilize fossil fuels (Hart, 1997; Kapdan and Kargi, 2006). Hydrogen production using microorganisms is an exciting new area of feasible technology (Levin et al., 2004; Zajic et al., 1978). Fermentative anaerobic microorganisms, such as Clostridium species, are known to be suitable for producing hydrogen from carbohydrates (Kataoka et al., 1997; Nandi and Sengupta, 1998; Reimann et al., 1996; Taguchi et al., 1996). Acidic pH, desiccation, chemicals, heat, or radiation could prevent hydrogen-utilizing methanogens by attenuating the activity of dehydrogenase, while the hydrogen-producing spore-forming clostridia remain alive in a mixed bacterial population (Chen et al., 2001; Cheong and Hansen, 2006a; Sparling et al., 1997). Nearly all of these studies were conducted to produce hydrogen from carbohydrate-rich wastewater within the conventional mesophilic temperature range (Angenent et al., 2004; Kapdan and Kargi, 2006; Mizuno et al., 2000). However, a thermophilic fermentation process generally has a higher production rate and thus could be of interest for industrial application, since many industrial wastewaters, such as those from food processing plants are often discharged at high temperatures. It is often preferable to treat these wastewaters under thermophilic conditions, which presumably are also more efficient at killing pathogens and degrading organics, and more resistant to contamination (Mackie and Bryant, 1995; Talabardon et al., 2000; Wiegant et al., 1986; Yu and Fang, 2000; Zabranska et al., 2000). Dugba and Zhang (1999) studied a temperature-phased anaerobic digestion system for treatment of dairy wastewater and reported that thermophilic–mesophilic staging is recommended over mesophilic–mesophilic staging when considering solids removal, biogas production, and coliform bacteria destruction. Some thermophilic Clostridium species and Thermoanerobacterium can produce hydrogen from organic substrates at thermophilic temperatures (Collet et al., 2003; Lamed et al., 1988; Liu et al., 1996; Lovitt et al., 1988; Ueno et al., 1996, 2001; Wiegel et al., 1989). In this study, we investigated the suitable enrichment and cultivation parameters for hydrogen-producing bacterial communities that would result in the highest hydrogen production, using mixed anaerobic sludge from synthetic wastewater at the thermophilic temperature of 55°C."
1,Methods,
2,Natural inocula,"2.1 Natural inocula The natural inocula for the batch experiments were obtained from the bottom portion of a pilot-scale, anaerobic induced blanket reactor treating local cattle manure treatment plant (Caine Dairy Farm, Wellsville, UT). Raw seed sludge was filtered through a screen (pore size: 2mm) to remove fibrous undigested materials before using."
3,Inocula enrichment and culture,"2.2 Inocula enrichment and culture Enrichment of hydrogen-producing mixed microflora was performed at acid conditions, with heat and without heat treatment. Raw seed sludge was inoculated (inocula: medium=1:1) into batch reactors (with a working volume of 1.9l) containing synthetic wastewater (10,000mg/l as COD). The pH of the reactors was maintained at 3 and 5, respectively, by pH controllers (Cole-Parmer Inc., Vernon Hills, IL) using 3N HCl and 3N NaOH. The characteristics of the synthetic wastewater were the same as those used (as low total nitrogen (N) concentration) in the batch hydrogen production experiments. The liquid in the reactor was completely mixed through periods of 48h at 35±1°C. After acidification, half of the seed sludge was heated (as wet heat-shock) at 95°C for 20min for heat treatment (HT), and the rest was used directly for experimentation as the non-heat treatment (NHT). Batch culture experiments were performed in a glass serum bottle with a working volume of 150ml. Each NHT and HT seed sludge was inoculated at 13.3% (v/v) into synthetic organic wastewater. Three sets of bottles for different pH cultivations (at initial pH 5, 6, and 7) were prepared. Each set was divided in two by the nitrogen supplement condition—one set containing the low N (0.8g/l as total N) supplement, and the other containing the high N (2.0g/l as total N) supplement. Initial pH adjustment was conducted with 10N HCl or 10N NaOH. After the addition of medium and enriched seed, the head space of the bottles was initially purged with nitrogen gas to eliminate remaining oxygen from the head space and then sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum crimps. The bottles were placed in a water bath shaker, with temperature controlled at 55±1°C. The experimental design for evaluating the batch hydrogen production under various parametric conditions is represented in Table 1 . Biogas production was measured using appropriately sized wetted syringes, ranging from 10 to 50ml at 5 or 6 time intervals for 121h. The total gas (as off-gas) production and hydrogen concentration were determined to measure the hydrogen production. The liquid contents were drawn out using a syringe to determine the VFA, ethanol, total carbohydrate (TC), and soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) concentrations."
4,Synthetic wastewater composition,"2.3 Synthetic wastewater composition The synthetic wastewater consisted of organic and inorganic nutrients. It had a COD of 25,000mg/l, which was mainly from glucose. The synthetic nutrients media were prepared by adding ammonium chloride (NH4Cl). The high N supplemented medium had a COD:N:P ratio of 100:8:0.6 and the low N supplemented medium had a COD:N:P ratio of 100:3.3:0.6. The components of the synthetic nutrients medium are described in Table 2 . To prevent the deficiency of microbial trace elements, a trace mineral solution (50mg/l H3BO3, 50mg/l ZnCl2, 30mg/l CuCl2, 500mg/l MnSO4 ·H2O, 50mg/l (NH4)6Mo7O24 ·4H2O, 50mg/l AlCl3, 50mg/l CoCl2 ·6H2O, 50mg/l NiCl2, and 1ml HCl (36%)) was added at the rate of 0.1% (v/v) to each of the synthetic nutrients media. The components were similar to those used for cultivating anaerobic bacteria by Zehnder et al. (1980). NaHCO3, 8000mg/l was added to each liter of medium to allow initial buffering capacity, and tap water (City of Logan, UT) was used as dilution water."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The VFAs (e.g., acetate, propionate, iso-butyrate, n-butyrate, iso-valerate, and n-valerate), as well as primary alcohol, were measured via gas chromatograph (GC, HP 6890 series, Hewlett–Packard, Wilmington, DE), using a cross-linked polyethylene glycol capillary column (HP-INNOWax) with dimensions of 30.0m×250μm×0.25μm. The temperature program for the column was 70°C held for 15min, 115°C held for 3min, and 240°C held for 1min. The inlet port and flame ionization detector temperature was 250°C. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.8ml/min. The hydrogen, methane, oxygen, and nitrogen contents in biogas were analyzed by GC (HP 6890 series, Hewlett-Packard, Wilmington, DE), using a RT-Msieve 5A PLOT capillary column (Restek) with dimensions of 30.0m×320μm×30.0μm. The column temperature was 35°C, while the inlet port and thermal conductivity detector temperatures were 50°C and 200°C, respectively. Argon was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.5ml/min. Gas standards were obtained form Scott Specialty Gases (Plumsteadville, PA). Two-point calibrations, except for oxygen, which was a single point, were performed for all gases tested on the GC to help insure accuracy in the measurements. TC content was determined using the phenol–sulfuric acid method, with glucose as a standard (Herbert et al., 1971), and SCOD was measured by the closed reflux colorimetric method (APHA, 1992). Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and soluble total Kjeldahl nitrogen (STKN) contents were analyzed according to procedures described in standard methods (APHA, 1992). Samples for SCOD, VFAs, ethanol, and STKN were obtained by filtering the samples through glass–fiber filter paper (Whatman GF/C). The biomass concentration in the serum bottle was estimated from the nitrogen content in the suspended solids, which was determined by the Kjeldahl method and the empirical formula for a microbial cell (C5H7NO2P0.06S0.1) (Speece, 1996). (1) Biomass concentration ( mg / l ) = ( TKN - STKN ) × ( 118 / 14 )"
6,Statistical data analysis,"2.5 Statistical data analysis Data for hydrogen production were statistically analyzed using a completely randomized design (by a four-way full factorial analysis with one replicate) in general linear model. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on the data, and a post hoc analysis using the Ryan–Einot–Gabriel–Welsch multiple range test (REGWQ) was used for multiple comparison of means (Oehlert, 2000). Means differing by more than the calculated REGWQ values were considered significantly different at a significance level of 0.05. The SAS (Statistical Analysis System, Cary, NC) system for Windows (release 9.1) was used for statistical analyses. The cumulative hydrogen production data were fitted to a modified Gompertz equation (Eq. (2)). The modified Gompertz equation is regarded as a suitable model for describing bacterial growth curve (Zwietering et al., 1990). This equation has been developed, based on the relation between bacterial growth and its metabolisms, to describe the progress of cumulative biogas/methane production in a batch experiment (Lay et al., 1998). The model was also used to determine the production of hydrogen (Lay, 2001; Lay et al., 1999; Lee et al., 2002). (2) H ( t ) = P · exp { - exp [ ( R m · e / P ) · ( λ - t ) + 1 ] } where H(t) is the cumulative hydrogen production (ml) during the culture time, t (h), P is the hydrogen production potential (ml), R m is the maximum hydrogen production rate (ml/h), e is 2.71828…, λ is the lag-phase time (h). The best values of P, R m, and λ in Eq. (2) were evaluated by fitting the hydrogen production data at culture times using the “mathematical” function under “non-linear model/loss” menu in the Systat v. 10.2 (Systat Software Inc., Point Richmond, CA). The specific hydrogen production rate (ml H2/h/g microbial cell) was acquired by dividing R m by microbial cell weight (g cell concentration analogized from organic nitrogen content of inoculum in each individual bottle)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Hydrogen production,"3.1 Hydrogen production Figs. 1 and 2 illustrate cumulative hydrogen production from the synthetic wastewater (as two different media containing low N and high N) during cultivations at pH 5, 6, and 7, after acid enrichment (with NHT and HT) at pH 3 and 5 at 55°C. In all experiments, the biogas contained hydrogen and carbon dioxide, including only the residual nitrogen from the initial purging. The biogas was free of methane, indicating the absence of methanogenic activities in the enriched natural inocula (data not shown). These results revealed that with acid enrichments at pH 3 or 5, the methanogenesis was significantly inhibited. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) for this cumulative hydrogen production data is presented in Table 3 . The main effects of pH adjustment and wet heat-shock, which were used for the enrichment of inocula, had highly significant effects (P <0.05) on the cumulative hydrogen production yield. A post hoc analysis using the REGWQ showed that HT of inocula and acid enrichment at pH 5 had significantly more (0.05 significance level) hydrogen production potential than the NHT and the acid enrichment at pH 3 (data not shown). Differing N concentrations have not shown any significant effect (P >0.05) on hydrogen production throughout all of the batch experiments. In the batches of acid enrichment at pH 3, the highest hydrogen production was observed in the culture at pH 7. Accumulated hydrogen yields were 69ml (NHT), 69ml (HT) in the medium containing a low N concentration, and 68ml (NHT) and 72ml (HT) in the medium containing a high N concentration. In the batches of acid enrichment at pH 5, the highest accumulated hydrogen was observed in the culture at pH 5 with HT, and the values were 136ml (in the medium containing a low N) and 156ml (in the medium containing a high N) (Figs. 1 and 2). These observations may be due to the variations of other treatment effects influencing hydrogen production yield with the enrichment condition at different pH. The results are also indicated by the interaction effects between enrichment pH and heat treatment and between enrichment pH and culture pH as shown in Table 3. The time course of specific hydrogen production during the cultivations after acid enrichment (with NHT and HT) at pH 3 and 5, from the synthetic wastewater containing a low N, is shown in Fig. 3 . The batch cultures, after enrichment at pH 3, revealed that higher specific hydrogen production potential was observed in the culture at pH 7, with a negligible lag-time period (<12h). The cultures at pH 5 and 6 had retarded specific hydrogen yields during the experimental conditions (Fig. 3a). These results reveal that culture pH affected hydrogen production and that a neutral pH may be suitable for the fermentation at 55°C after acid enrichment at pH 3. In the thermophilic cultivations after acid enrichment at pH 5 (with NHT and HT), the results reveal that HT contributed a synergistic effect to the specific hydrogen yields under all culture pH conditions. The cultivation with HT enhanced the specific hydrogen production by 6.31, 2.93, and 1.88 times for each culture pH of 5, 6, and 7, respectively, as compared with those cultivated for NHT. Specifically, the batch culture at pH 5 with HT showed remarkably enhanced specific hydrogen potential (Fig. 3b). This result indicates that the HT could have acted as a means of harvesting hydrogen-producing spore-formers. This observation agrees with the reports presented by several investigators (Fan et al., 2004; Lay, 2000; Oh et al., 2003; Van Ginkel et al., 2001). Some investigators obtained enhanced hydrogen production with pure cultures of Clostridium species at neutral pH ranges of 6.0–7.3 using mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures (Kataoka et al., 1997; Lamed et al., 1988; Taguchi et al., 1995). Therefore, in the batches that resulted in enhanced hydrogen production under culture pH 5, it was speculated that the surviving and dominant hydrogen-producing microorganisms are thermophiles other than thermophilic Clostridium species. The anaerobic acidophilic (eu)bacteria, Thermanaerobacterium are Gram-positive, endospore-formers. These bacteria thrive at temperatures above 50°C, with stability around a pH of 5.0. Several species of Thermanaerobacterium (e.g., T. thermosaccholyticum, T. polysaccharolyticum, and T. aotearoense) are known for their hydrogen-producing characteristics (Collins et al., 1994; Liu et al., 1996; Ueno et al., 2001). The conflicting results of hydrogen-producing behavior between enrichment pH 3 and 5 with heat treatment can be explained in terms of a heterogeneous population of spore-formers with differing heat stability (Hyun et al., 1983). The changes in gas production, composition, TC, and SCOD in the two conditions that showed the highest hydrogen production potential during cultivation after acid enrichment at pH 3 and 5 (with NHT and HT), respectively, are illustrated in Fig. 4 . The cultivation at pH 7 after acid enrichment at pH 3 with HT showed that the biogas reached its maximum of 171ml (as cumulative content) until 46h, while composition of hydrogen gas reached a maximum of 45–53% at culture times of 21–46h; however, the gas immediately declined to around 9% after 50h. During the period following, biogas was still produced, but at a rapidly decreasing rate, until the end of the test. The decreases in hydrogen gas concentrations were replaced by an increased proportion of carbon dioxide (Fig. 4a). TC, the main substrate for microbial metabolism, which was utilized to around 61% in 46h, showed the highest hydrogen composition and reached 79% by the end of the culture period. Because the main acidogenic products were VFA and alcohol, only a small amount of influent COD was removed. The SCOD removal was 18.2% in the culture time of 46h (Fig. 4b). This small COD reduction was caused by volatilization of the gas COD fraction (as hydrogen and carbon dioxide) and biomass yield. But biomass produced by substrate consumption could not be evaluated against the background of a high concentration of sludge solids used as the inoculum. The cultivation at pH 5 after acid enrichment at pH 5 (with HT) showed a longer duration of hydrogen concentration with a delayed period of initial hydrogen production. The hydrogen composition was maintained at around 51–64% until 32–96h, and the total biogas production reached 243ml (Fig. 4c). However, the hydrogen concentration completely disappeared after 96h. The substrate (as TC) utilization efficiency and SCOD removal were 47% and 16%, respectively (Fig. 4d). These thermophilic batch experiments had hydrogen consumptions after the late-exponential phase of the fermentation. The hydrogen consumption was assumed to be due to the activity of thermophilc homoacetogenic bacteria. At mesophilic temperature, spore-forming homoacetogenic bacteria can produce acetate from hydrogen and carbon dioxide (Ince and Ince, 2000; Minton and Clarke, 1989; Ohwaki and Hungate, 1977). Also, at thermophilic temperatures, spore-forming homoacetogens (e.g., Clostridium thermoaceticum and Clostridium thermoautotrophicum) can cause a consumption of hydrogen through interspecies transfer via acetogenesis (Cheryan et al., 1997; Collet et al., 2003; Rainey et al., 1993). However, it was not clear whether loss of hydrogen after 96h, in the cultivation at pH 5 after enrichment at pH 5, this was due to the activity of homoacetogenic bacteria or the stationary phase of biomass growth in the fermentative reaction."
9,Intermediate metabolites production,"3.2 Intermediate metabolites production VFAs and organic solvents were measured in all serum bottles at time intervals of several hours after the start of the thermophilic batch experiments. Acetate and n-butyrate were predominant. Additionally, propionate, iso-butyrate, iso-valerate, and n-valerate were detected below the detection limit or in trace amounts in the VFAs monitored. Ethanol was produced at higher concentrations among the measured organic solvents. The intermediate metabolite production showed different profiles, depending on the culture pH (by low N concentration) after acid enrichment at pH 3, as shown in Fig. 5 . The n-butyrate production presented a significantly elevated concentration with increasing pH. Cultivation at pH 7 revealed the highest hydrogen yields; the average n-butyrate concentration reached 4921mg COD/l (NHT) and 2850mg COD/l (HT). Interestingly, the cultivation at pH 5 had concentrations of n-butyrate less than 100mg COD/l for both NHT and HT, and the maximum ethanol productions were 7417mg COD/l (NHT) and 6479mg COD/l (HT) throughout the batch experiments. These results reveal that at enrichment pH 3, the lower culture pH produced poor butyrate fermentation with elevated levels of ethanol. Some investigators found that increasing pH led to the shift in metabolic activity from VFAs to alcohols production, resulting in an inhibition in hydrogen production (Lay et al., 1999; Lay and Noike, 1999). However, this observation seems to be due to the improper selection of hydrogen-producing spore-formers. A common acidogenic conversion (i.e., preformed without the enrichment step for selection of hydrogen-producing microbial community) could produce significant quantities of ethanol with a higher concentration of propionate (Horiuchi et al., 2002; Yu and Fang, 2000, 2003). The VFAs and ethanol production profiles during the cultures (by low N concentration) at various pHs after acid enrichment at pH 5 are shown in Fig. 6 . The total main acidogenic liquid product concentrations (as the combined concentrations of acetate, propionate, n-butyrate, and ethanol) were highest in the cultivation at pH 7, with concentrations of 6479mg COD/l (NHT) and 7400mg COD/l (HT) after a culture time of 96h. However, distribution ratios for the main acidogenic liquid products at culture pH 7 with NHT were acetate 18%, n-butyrate 29%, and ethanol 52%, while application of HT yielded distribution ratios of acetate 13%, n-butyrate 69%, and ethanol 19%, respectively. Specifically, the HT condition stimulated production of n-butyrate, irrespective of culture pH. The n-butyrate was increased 14.5, 3.8, and 2.4 times for each HT, compared with NHT, for the cultures with pH 5, 6, and 7, respectively. Propionate, one of the common anaerobic fermentative liquid products, was completely suppressed. As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the profiles of quantities of n-butyrate produced were positively correlated with the pattern of hydrogen produced in the cumulative and specific yields presented in Figs. 1 and 2. Butyrate fermentation produces n-butyrate and acetate, with hydrogen and carbon dioxide as gas products (Cohen et al., 1984; Yu and Fang, 2000). These results indicate that the behavior of thermophilic hydrogen production uses butyrate-type fermentation as the main metabolism. The ethanol production profiles also significantly reflected the diminishing hydrogen gas concentration (Figs. 5 and 6). Propionate fermentation is known to produce propionate, acetate, and valerate, without significant gas production, and hydrogen is not involved in that fermentative pathway (Cohen et al., 1984; McCarty and Mosey, 1991). In our thermophilic batch experiments, the results imply that propionate-producing bacteria, which could not be involved with thermophilic hydrogen-producing potential, were completely inhibited throughout the acid enrichment step. Clostridium thermobutyricum and Clostridium thermopalmarium are known as typical thermophilic butyrate-producing spore-forming bacteria, with an optimal temperature range of 55–57°C (Rainey et al., 1993). However, whether or not acidophilic Thermoanaerobacterium species can produce butyrate is not known."
10,Comparison of hydrogen production at mesophilic and thermophilic conditions,"3.3 Comparison of hydrogen production at mesophilic and thermophilic conditions The experimental data from the cumulative hydrogen production obtained from the batch experiments was used to fit the modified Gompertz equation, and the results are shown in Table 4 . The values of hydrogen production potential (P), maximum hydrogen production rate (R m), lag duration time (λ), and specific hydrogen production rate at 55°C were compared, along with the previous experimental results (Cheong and Hansen, 2006b) that showed highest hydrogen yields at 35°C. Table 3 shows that the P was 134ml (cultivation at pH 5, enrichment pH 5 with HT) and 70ml (cultivation at pH 7, enrichment pH 3 with HT), respectively, for the thermophilic batches. In the mesophilic condition, the P was 67 ml (cultivation at pH 7, enrichment pH 3 with HT). These fitted values were very consistent with our experimental data; the best-fit curves based on Eq. (2) are shown in Fig. 7 . Eq. (2) also correlated hydrogen production data well, with R >0.99 in the batches. The R m were in the range of 3.4–5.0 (ml/h) for both the mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures. However, λ for the 55°C data had higher values than it did for 35°C. The thermophilic batch (cultivation at pH 5, enrichment pH 5 with HT) showed higher P and revealed a longer λ of 22.3 (h). At 55°C, the cultivation at pH 5 after enrichment (with HT) at pH 5 showed that the enriched inocula converted more substrate into hydrogen at a slower synthesis rate. With respect to the λ value for the thermophilic batch, the longer lag time was probably due to the need for bacteria to alter their physiological state for the new environment or to germinate spores. This suggests that the slower maximum hydrogen production rate at the thermophilic temperature corresponded to that reported by Levin et al. (2004), who compared the rates of hydrogen synthesis during anaerobic dark fermentation. The cultivation at pH 7 presented relatively short lag-time duration, irrespective of the temperature. This implies that neutral culture pH levels could shorten the lag-phase period and be suitable for quick acclimation of hydrogen-producing anaerobic microorganisms. The specific hydrogen production rates for both 35°C and 55°C were in the range of 25–28ml H2/h/g microbial cell, despite the fact that one thermophilic batch (cultivation at pH 5, enrichment pH 5 with HT) had a superior P value."
11,Conclusions,"Enhanced hydrogen production could be achieved in a proper culture pH level with enrichment of hydrogen-producing spore-forming bacteria from the carbohydrate-rich organics under thermophilic conditions (55°C), compared with that produced under mesophilic conditions (35°C). The conditions of heat treatment and enrichment pH were the main treatment effects that were significant (P <0.05) on the hydrogen production. With an acid enrichment of pH 3, the cultivation at pH 7 contributed positively to hydrogen production yield, and the heat treatment of inocula after acid enrichment at pH 5 resulted in enhanced hydrogen production, compared with non-heat treated sludge. There was no significant (P >0.05) difference in hydrogen production based solely on the two levels of nitrogen throughout the batch thermophilic experiments. The biogas contained up to 53–64% hydrogen, while the culture pH conditions showed maximum hydrogen evolution. Under thermophilic temperatures, the maximum hydrogen production potential of 134ml with a specific hydrogen production rate of 25 ml H2/h/g cell was achieved at culture pH 5 (after HT and enrichment at pH 5). Throughout the thermophilic batch experiments, the main intermediate metabolites were acetate, n-butyrate, and ethanol. Propionate formation was suppressed completely during fermentation. Yields of produced hydrogen were correlated with increasing concentrations of n-butyrate, and quantities of ethanol present were significant in the batches producing lower yields of hydrogen. These results indicate that thermophilic acidogenesis enhances hydrogen production are consistent with the biochemical pathway of butyrate fermentation."
