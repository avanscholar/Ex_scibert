0,Introduction,"Bioenergy is one promising source for catering to the substantial energy demands due to the abundant biomass availability at local and global locations (Rasheed et al., 2021; Sharma et al., 2016a, 2016b, 2016c). They are known as carbon-neutral fuels because the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere from biofuel combustion is relatively much lower than the amount absorbed by the plants. Combustion of biofuels also produces a considerably lower net amount of exhaust gases such as carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and particulate matter, as compared to petro-fuel (Khan et al., 2018; Sharma et al., 2021). Converting the abundantly available waste biomass materials such as sewage sludge, agriculture waste, and forest waste to biofuels is a major thrust area around the world. Sewage sludge is a solid waste produced by municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants across the world. The generation of sewage sludge has expanded considerably as a result of growing urbanisation and industrialisation. Annually, the EU-27, the United States, China, Iran, Turkey, Canada, and Brazil each report around 8910, 6510, 2960, 650, 580, 550, and 370 thousand metric tonnes of sludge (dry basis) respectively (Singh et al., 2020). Disposal and management of sewage sludge are some of the key issues in the world. Improper management results in various environmental issues leading to air, water, and soil pollution (Raza et al., 2019; Thomsen et al., 2017). Many traditional sewage sludge treatment methods exist, including agricultural application, sewage sludge disposal in landfills and oceans, and incineration (Rajendran et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2020; Tozlu et al., 2016). On the other hand, these approaches might result in significant pollution incidents or need substantial treatment expenses, and are neither environmentally friendly nor cost-effective (X. Liu et al., 2021; Tang et al., 2018). Therefore, increasing concerns and stringent limitations on conventional sludge disposal practices have shifted the focus of attention to the energy component of waste materials, with sludge being viewed as an energy resource. Recently, the pyrolysis process has drawn more attention due to better economic performance, greater efficiency, and superior volume reduction (Ambaye et al., 2021; Mphahlele et al., 2021). According to literature, the pyrolysis technology has impressive potential for sewage sludge utilization as it decreases 50 wt% of the volume of available sludge along with the advantage of producing liquid fuel and solid biochar (Fonts et al., 2012). Kim and Parker (2008), performed experiments with primary, TWAS (thickened waste activated sludge) and digested sludge at 250–500 °C and confirms that pyrolysis of sewage sludge was more economically viable to convert into biofuels. Arazo et al. (2017), conducted sewage sludge pyrolysis experiments in a fixed-bed pyrolysis reactor and studied the impact of temperature, sludge particle size and vapor residence time on bio-oil properties. Some researchers also investigated high-temperature pyrolysis of domestic sewage at temperatures of 450 °C, 600 °C, and 850 °C in order to maximise the generation of pyrolysis gases (Karaca et al., 2018). Barry et al. (2019), tested both slow and fast pyrolysis reactions with municipal sewage sludge waste and found that pyrolysis outperforms incineration in terms of environmental advantages. Chen et al. (2019), studied the effect of pressure on the pyrolysis reaction in order to obtain the highest possible production of pyrolysis gases with the enhanced composition of tar and char qualities. To optimise reaction products such as pyrolysis gases, bio-oil, pyrogenic water, and biochar, Gerasimov et al. (2019) pyrolyzed dried sewage sludge using a solid heat carrier at 490–580 °C. In addition, Hanif et al. (2019) carried out pyrolysis to optimise the output of biochar, pyrolysis gases, and bio-oil from anaerobically digested sewage sludge (Hanif et al., 2019). Liu et al. (2020) performed the pyrolysis of sewage sludge in a fluidized bed reactor for maximum recovery of biofuels. Sobek and Werle (2020) performed the solar thermal pyrolysis of sewage sludge and estimated the intrinsic kinetics parameters using different models and methods. For the intrinsic kinetics of sewage sludge pyrolysis, most investigations have been focused on the conversion of solid fractions rather than the release of volatile gases. Most of the experiments are investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at moderate and low heating rates. It is observed from literature, there are very limited studies showing the impact of different operational conditions on the pyrolysis reaction along with the quality of the products in the case of sewage sludge. Hence, the knowledge gaps in the pyrolysis process and kinetic parameters estimation of high-ash sewage sludge need to assess and report to the scientific community. As a result, the current research looks into the pyrolysis behaviour of sewage sludge at different temperatures, as well as the analysis and potential applications of pyrolysis products and pyrolysis kinetics. Objectives of research: 1). To investigate the influence of temperature on the yields of sewage sludge pyrolysis product, 2). To investigate the detailed features of sewage sludge feedstock and reaction products such as bio-oil, biochar, and pyrolysis gases (e.g. proximate and ultimate analysis, TGA analysis, FTIR, GC-MS, and XRF analysis), and 3) Using the Coats-Redfern approach, investigate the kinetic parameters of the pyrolysis reaction."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Feedstock collection and preparation,"2.1 Feedstock collection and preparation Sewage sludge (SS) was collected from the in-house wastewater sewage treatment plant (STP) located at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES), Dehradun, India. The feed was held for 24 h at 100 °C in a hot air oven to remove moisture. Dried feed was smashed into smaller chunks and sieved to sizes between 90 and 150 μm for the TGA pyrolysis experiment. The feed size in the fixed-bed pyrolysis reactor was chosen to be 5–10 mm."
3,Experimental apparatus and procedure,"2.2 Experimental apparatus and procedure The pyrolysis reactor used for the experiment was made up of a cylindrical quartz glass vessel with dimensions of 45 cm length and 6 cm internal diameter equipped with an electric heater furnace and PID temperature controller. A K-type thermocouple temperature probe was introduced into the reactor through the top of the reactor to observe the temperature of the reactor and the instant temperature of the feedstock. To prevent leakage, the reactor was thoroughly sealed with vacuum grease before the experiment began. To reduce heat loss, the entire reactor was carefully insulated with glass wool packing. Three cylindrical water-cooling condensers were connected to the pyrolysis reactor to collect and condense volatile vapours. Each experiment was performed using approximately 100 g of sewage sludge fed into the pyrolysis reactor. The experiments were performed at different temperatures of 250 °C, 350 °C, 450 °C, 500 °C, 550 °C, 600 °C, and 700 °C. Nitrogen gas was purged for 15 min to create an inert atmosphere inside the reactor. The reactor was heated at the rate of 10 °C min−1 from room temperature to the desired temperature and kept in an isothermal condition for an hour to ensure the completion of the reaction process. The condensed volatile gases (bio-oil) were collected in the condensers. Non-condensable gases were collected in a bag and further analysed by gas chromatography. Leftover reaction residue known as biochar was collected and examine with different analytical procedures to see its utilization feasibility. After each experiment, the reactor was cooled down at room temperature. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and the average values reported here were within the standard deviation ± 1.0%. Fig. 1 demonstrates the proposed methodology adopted in this manuscript."
4,Characterization of feedstock and pyrolysis products,"2.3 Characterization of feedstock and pyrolysis products 2.3.1 Proximate and ultimate analysis The proximate analysis of sewage sludge (SS) feedstock and sewage sludge biochar (SSBC) was performed according to ASTM D3172-07a standards. The different parameters like moisture content, volatile matter, fixed carbon, and ash content were identified. The ultimate analysis i.e., the elemental composition of SS feedstock and SSBC were performed using a Thermo Flash 2000 CHNS/O elemental analyser. Carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), and sulfur (S) were examined, and oxygen (O) was calculated by difference from 100 wt%. 2.3.2 Thermogravimetric analysis TGA analysis of SS feedstock and SSBC was performed using a thermogravimetric analyzer (EXSTAR TG/DTA 6300) instrument under the inert atmosphere from room temperature to 900 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Mass loss and differential mass loss were recorded with time (t) and temperature (T). 2.3.3 Fourier transformation infrared analysis Functional groups of SS feedstock, bio-oil, and SSBC were investigated using FTIR spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, USA) in the frequency range of 400–4000 cm−1. The resolution of the spectrometer was set to 8 cm−1. All the samples were prepared with potassium bromide (KBr) in press. 2.3.4 Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis The chemical composition of bio-oil was analysed using Gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, USA) equipped with a capillary column (DB-5 MS) with a dimension of 30 m length and 0.25 mm. The column temperature was set initially at 75 °C for 5 min then increased up to 250 °C with a rate of 10 °C min−1 and held for 25 min in the isothermal condition. Helium was used as a carrier gas. The flow of helium gas in the column was maintained at 1.5 mL min−1. The mass spectrometer ion source was set at a temperature of 250 °C and mass range 40–1000 m/z. All the compounds were identified using NIST 11 library. 2.3.5 Gas chromatograph analysis The non-condensable gases obtained from fixed-bed pyrolysis reactor were analysed by gas chromatograph (NUCON made, model 5700 series) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Porapak Q column (0.32 cm dia. and 24.37 cm length) and molecular sieve 5A, 60/80 mesh (0.32 cm dia. and 24.37 cm length) were used in series to separate the gases for analysis. Argon was used as a carrier gas. The oven and detector temperature of GC was maintained isothermally at 60 °C and 100 °C throughout the analysis. The GC was calibrated by a standard gas mixture. The standard gases were used for analysing the unknown compositions of non-condensable gases obtained from the pyrolysis reactor."
5,Pyrolysis kinetics,"2.4 Pyrolysis kinetics Several model-free methods are used to calculate kinetic parameters from the TG data (Ma et al., 2021; Nisar et al., 2019). However present study focused on Coats-Redfern methods. A detailed derivation is shown from Eq. (1) to Eq. 10, and a description of all the equations used is presented here. Pyrolysis of sewage sludge is a very complex phenomenon because of variations in chemical composition within the sludge (H. Liu et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2018). So many reactions occur simultaneously within a fraction of a second during thermal degradation. Therefore, predicting the exact reaction mechanism is not possible. The overall reaction mechanism of the sewage sludge in the pyrolysis process is given in Scheme 1 . We assume that conversion of sewage sludge into products is the only single-step process in this study. The rate of reaction was calculated using Eq. (1). The rate equation for changing the state of sewage sludge to a volatile and char is given in Eq. (2). (1) k = k 0 exp ( − E R T ) (2) d α d t = k f ( α ) Where α = fractional conversion given by Eq. (3), t = time, f ( α ) is the reaction model. (3) α = w 0 − w t w 0 − w f where w0 = initial weight of sewage sludge, wt = weight of sewage sludge at a particular time, wf = final weight of the sewage sludge or biochar. An Arrhenius temperature dependency of the rate constant can be expressed as in Eq. (4). Eq. (4) is for constant heating rate. (4) d α d t = A exp ( − E R T ) f ( α ) According to uniform kinetic reaction of samples, f ( α ) can be represented as: (5) f ( α ) = ( 1 − α ) n From Eq. 4, and 5, we get, (6) d α d t = k 0 exp ( − E R T ) ( 1 − α ) n The heating rate is defined as β = d T d t , combining Eq. (6) and β, we get, (7) d α d T = k 0 β exp ( − E R T ) ( 1 − α ) n Eq. (7) expressed the conversion of biomass with respect to temperature. Integrating Eq. (7) we get Eq. (8), (8) g ( κ ) = ∫ 0 x d x f ( x ) = ∫ 0 T A exp ( − E R T ) d T β From Eq. (8), we get Eqs (9) and (10). (9) g ( κ ) = A β ∫ 0 T exp ( − E R T ) d T (10) g ( κ ) = A E R β ∫ 0 x u − 2 e − u d u = A E R β p ( x ) where g ( κ ) represents integral conversion, x = E R T . However, p ( x ) has no exact solution; therefore, it can be solved by the numerical approximation method. p ( x ) is varied with respect to the type of approximation selected for simplifying (Mishra and Mohanty, 2018). 2.4.1 Coats redfern The Coats-Redfern equation is commonly used to study the kinetics of solid-state reactions (Naqvi et al., 2019). By integrating and rearranging Eq. (8), the following equation (Eq. (11)) is obtained (11) 1 − ( 1 − α ) ( 1 − n ) 1 − n = A β ∫ 0 T e − E / R T d T Integration of the term e − E / R T and neglecting the higher-order terms lead to Eq. (12): (12) 1 − ( 1 − α ) ( 1 − n ) 1 − n = A R T 2 β E [ 1 − 2 R T E e − E R T ] Taking the log of Eq. (11), the following expression (Eq. (13)) is developed: (13) ln [ 1 − ( 1 − α ) ( 1 − n ) T 2 ( 1 − n ) ] = ln [ A R β E [ 1 − 2 R T E ] ] − E R T To simplify the equation, the order of the reaction is taken as one and hence, Eq. (14) is obtained: (14) ln [ ln ( 1 − α ) T 2 ] = ln [ A R β E ] − E R T If the order of reaction was taken as 'n', then following Eq. (15) is obtained and used to find the kinetic Arrhenius parameters. (15) ln ( g ( α ) T 2 ) = ln ( A R β E ) ( 1 − 2 R T E − E R T ) The data obtained from the TGA analysis during the pyrolysis of sewage sludge was analysed using four kinetic models (S1) using the Coats-Redfern method. The reaction model best suited is the one that has the highest regression coefficient for the graph between ln ( g ( α ) / T 2 ) Versus 1/T. Activation energy can be obtained by drawing a graph between 1/T and ln ( g ( α ) / T 2 ) and by obtaining slope from a drawn straight line. The pre-exponential factor can be obtained from the intercept of this graph."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of SS feedstock,"3.1 Characterization of SS feedstock 3.1.1 Proximate and ultimate analysis The characteristic properties and composition of the feedstock were analysed using proximate and ultimate analyses. The results obtained from the proximate and ultimate analysis of SS are shown in Table 1 . The proximate analysis showed that SS contains 12.3 wt% moisture content, 50.9 wt% volatile matters, 9.1 wt% fixed carbon, and 27.7 wt% ash content. Lower moisture content is good to improve heat transfer (Bora et al., 2020). Volatile matters refer to the organic compound released during heating, while fixed carbon (FC) indicates solid combustible residue left over after the complete burning and releasing of volatiles. The presence of higher volatile content in SS results in the production of higher amounts of bio-oils and pyrolysis gases (Pradhan et al., 2016). The presence of higher fixed carbon and ash content may reduce the heating value of SS (Havilah et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2020a, 2020b). In the present investigation, the ash content was higher (27.7 wt%) which may be due to the influx of silts and sand particles into wastewater treatment plants (Karaca et al., 2018; Shahbeig and Nosrati, 2019). The results of the ultimate analysis showed that the SS contains 37.95 wt% C, 4.51 wt% H, 2.75 wt% N, 0.73 wt% S and 54.07 wt% O and was comparable to the reported literature (Table 1). The atomic ratio of H/C and O/C for SS was observed to be 3.49 and 1.10 respectively. Based on elemental composition, the empirical formula of the SS was derived as CH3.49N0.05S0.00018O1.10. The higher heating value of sewage sludge biomass was 11.69 MJ kg−1 which was lower than other studies e.g. (Gao et al., 2017; Karaca et al., 2018; Shahbeig and Nosrati, 2019). 3.1.2 Thermogravimetric analysis The graph of TGA and DTG curves for SS are illustrated in Fig. 2 a. The results revealed that the thermal degradation of SS started at the temperature of 217 °C (8.51% mass loss) and continued up to 493 °C with a mass loss of 72.9%. After 493 °C, the mass loss curve became approximately stable and the mass loss between 493 °C and 900 °C was only 3.55%. The TGA curve showed three stages of thermal decompositions. The first phase was observed from room temperature to 217 °C, corresponding to the release of moisture within the surface or free bond water and low boiling point volatiles. The second stage includes the temperature from 217 °C to 493 °C and indicates the release of volatiles such as hydrocarbons, proteins, carboxylic acid, polysaccharides, sugars, and aliphatic compounds. A significant mass loss (64.39%) was observed in this stage and therefore, it is referred to as an active pyrolysis zone. The third stage i.e., above 493 °C indicates the degradation of the large complex molecules of SS includes some inorganic compounds. The maximum mass loss rate (DTGmax) was observed at 455 °C under nitrogen atmospheric conditions (Fig. 2a). The results of the TGA/DTG analysis of SS show similarity with other studies (Alvarez et al., 2016; Gao et al., 2020; Shahbeig and Nosrati, 2019). From TGA/DTG analysis experiment, it was concluded that the pyrolysis zone of SS was in the temperature range of 217–493 °C. 3.1.3 FTIR analysis FTIR analysis of sewage sludge was performed from 400 cm−1 to 4000 cm−1 wavenumbers and is represented in Fig. 2b. FTIR results showed that a peak was observed at 3415 cm−1 corresponding to O–H stretching broadband which indicates the presence of phenol and alcohol with water impurities. The presence of the alkane group was confirmed by C–H stretching at 2926 cm−1. The broad peak around 1648 cm−1 was due to CC in aromatics structures. The peak around 1092 cm−1 was due to C–O stretching of carbohydrate and alcohol functions which reflects the presence of polysaccharides or cellulose in sewage sludge. In conclusion, sewage sludge has functional groups including –OH, –COOH, -COOR-, C–H, CC, and –NH which reflects the presence of lignocellulose, hemicelluloses, lignin, fats, and proteins."
8,Effect of reaction temperature on the product distribution,"3.2 Effect of reaction temperature on the product distribution Temperature plays a major role in the product distribution of pyrolysis reaction. Therefore, experiments were conducted at various temperatures of 250 °C, 350 °C, 450 °C, 500 °C, 550 °C, 600 °C and 700 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. It was observed from the results, the bio-oil yield was increasing with increasing temperature and a maximum yield of 22.4 wt% was obtained at the temperature of 500 °C (Fig. S1). However, with increasing temperatures above 500 °C, there is no significant change in the bio-oil yield but increasing of pyrolysis gas yield was observed. While the production of biochar was reduced from 71.0 wt% (250 °C) to 58.4 wt% (700 °C). Similar trends are observed in the mass loss curve (Fig. 2a) which demonstrated the maximum mass loss was detected between 217 °C and 493 °C. The pyrolysis gas yield was observed minimum (11.8 wt%) at 250 °C while the maximum (22.6 wt%) at 700 °C. At higher temperatures, large condensable volatile compounds further break down into smaller volatile matters which are non-condensable gases, thereby increasing the composition of pyrolysis gases (Chen et al., 2021; Ghodke and Mandapati, 2019). As a result, the bio-oil yield lowers but pyrolysis gases yield increases at higher temperatures. The results observed in the study are found to be similar as reported in the literature (Karaca et al., 2018; Shahbeig and Nosrati, 2019)."
9,Characterisation of pyrolysis products,"3.3 Characterisation of pyrolysis products 3.3.1 Bio-oil characterisation 3.3.1.1 FTIR and GC-MS analysis The composition of SS pyrolysis bio-oil was analysed using FTIR and GC-MS, as shown in Fig. 3 and supplementary material S2 respectively. The results of FTIR analysis revealed that SS pyrolysis bio-oil has broad absorption at 3443 cm−1, 2971 cm−1, 1642 cm−1, 1407 cm−1 and 661 cm−1 respectively (Fig. 3). The broad spectrum between 3500 and 3300 cm−1 was due to –OH stretching indicating the presence of the functional groups of alcohol, carboxylic group, phenol, and –NH stretching of amines and amide groups. The spectrum from 2900 to 2850 cm−1 represents the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of aliphatic CH and corresponding to the presence of alkanes. Furthermore, the spectrum observed between 1690 and 1575 cm−1 is due to the double-bond groups such as azo groups, amino groups, and amides. The spectrum obtained between 1470 and 1365 cm−1 represents the asymmetric and symmetric CH bending of methyl, particularly alkanes, including gem-dimethyl and tert-butyl groups. Based on FTIR analysis, it may confirm that bio-oil has a good quantity of ester, ketone, ether, alcohols, alkane, phenol, carboxylic acids, aromatics, nitrogen-containing compounds, and other compounds which can be further confirmed by GC-MS analysis. The GC-MS analysis results of SS pyrolysis bio-oil are demonstrated as supplementary material S3. It is observed from GC-MS analysis that SS bio-oil is a good mixture of ketone, ester, aldehyde, cyclic compounds, carboxylic acids, aromatics, amines, and amides. In the present study, the SS pyrolysis bio-oil was composed of 15.4% nitrogen-containing compounds, 30.59% oxygenated compounds, and 13.55% hydrocarbons. The presence of hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds is a good sign of its fuel application. However, the presence of nitrogen compounds lowers its fuel quality. The nitrogen compounds in SS pyrolysis bio-oil may be due to the dehydration reactions of peptide bonds which were present in the protein fraction of sewage sludge (Arazo et al., 2017). The results were in line with other investigations carried out by different researchers (Djandja et al., 2020; Naqvi et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2019). 3.3.1.2 Physical characteristics analysis The fuel properties of bio-oil obtained from SS pyrolysis are presented in Table 2 . All the physical characteristics properties such as calorific value, density, viscosity, pH, elemental composition (C, H, N, O, and S), and pour point were analysed using ASTM standard methods. Calorific value is an important property of fuel and represents heat production per unit of fuel during complete combustion. The calorific value of bio-oil in the present study was 16.53 MJ kg−1 which is lower than the reported values in the literature (Alvarez et al., 2015). This may be due to the presence of more oxygen content in bio-oil. Viscosity and density are the other properties that highly influence the combustion behaviour of fuel (Sharma et al, 2016c, 2021, 2016c). The viscosity and density of bio-oil were 24.62 cP and 917 kg m−3 compared to diesel (density: 821 kg m−3, viscosity: 2.3 cP). Higher viscosity and density of fuel result in poor atomization and incomplete combustion leading to poor performance and possible higher emissions from the engine utilization (Sharma et al., 2020a, 2020b; Suresh Kumar et al., 2020). The pH value of the bio-oil was examined as 5.6 which confirmed its acidic nature. This may be the presence of some organic acids. The more the acidic nature of the fuel, the more it will be corrosive and, therefore, the up-gradation of bio-oil is essential to make it a suitable fuel. The pour point of fuel indicates its cold flow properties (Ghodke et al., 2021; Sharma et al., 2016a). The pour point of sewage sludge oil was found to be 7 °C. In addition, the elemental composition of bio-oil confirms the presence of 35.43 wt% carbon, 10.33 wt% hydrogen, 2.20 wt% nitrogen, 0.017 wt% sulfur, and 52.02 wt% oxygen by difference. The presence of oxygen fuels leads to complete combustion and results in improving engine performance and emissions. However, there is also a drawback in the presence of oxygen which reduces the calorific value of the fuel. 3.3.2 Characterisation of biochar Biochar obtained from pyrolysis of sewage sludge was analysed using proximate and ultimate analysis, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), FTIR, and XRF. The proximate and ultimate analysis of SS biochar is shown in Table 3 . The results showed that the volatile matters of sewage sludge feedstock was reduced from 50.9 wt% to 8.95 wt% while fixed carbon was increased from 9.1% to 29.12 % indicating effective carbonisation. The ash content of SS biochar was observed to be 59.64 wt% in comparison to SS feedstock (27.7 wt%). In addition, the ultimate analysis showed that SS biochar had 27.36 wt% carbon, 0.94 wt% hydrogen, and 1.29 wt% nitrogen along with a small amount of sulfur (0.55 wt%) which indicates its potential as organic manure. The heating value of sewage sludge biochar was measured as 10.04 MJ kg−1 which was a good indication of further utilization as a solid fuel in boilers/power plants by blending with coal. Thermogravimetric analysis curves of SS biochar are illustrated in Fig. 4 a. It was observed from TGA analysis of SS biochar, the maximum mass loss was observed as 59.68% compared to sewage sludge feedstock (24.39%) at 900 °C which indicates releasing of volatile matters in form of bio-oil or pyrolysis gas. The FTIR investigations of SS biochar showed the broad spectra were obtained at 3427 cm−1, 1433 cm−1and 1026 cm−1 which were due to O–H stretching, C ≡ C deformation vibrations, and CO stretching indicating the presence of alcohol, ester, ether, carboxylic acid, and hydrocarbons (Fig. 4b). The peak spectra around 2900 cm−1 and 1600 was found absent in biochar while present in feedstock (2926 cm−1 1642 cm-1) and bio-oil (2971 cm−1 1648 cm−1) which confirm that some volatiles matter such as esters, carboxylic acids, ethers, alkanes, and nitrogen compounds were released from SS feedstock during pyrolysis process and formed bio-oil. Further, the intensity of the peaks observed in biochar at 3427 cm−1 and 1433 cm−1 significantly decreased compared with raw SS feedstock indicating the release of volatile content. X-ray fluorescence analysis was performed to investigate the presence of inorganic metal content in SS feedstock and SS biochar and results are shown as supplementary material S3. The results revealed that SS biochar has 4.25% P2O5 and 2.28% K2O along with a good amount of micro-and macro-nutrient (Fe, Mg, Ca, Na, Mn) in which common nutrients are supplied to as phosphorus and potassium fertilizer. Furthermore, the ultimate analysis confirmed the presence of 37.36% carbon and 1.29% nitrogen. Based on the presence of different elements such as C, N, K, P, Fe, Mg, Ca, and Na, it can be concluded that sewage sludge biochar may be a good source of organic manure. However, the removing of some elements like Al, Ti and silica is necessary before using it as organic manure. 3.3.3 Characteristics of non-condensable pyrolysis gases Pyrolysis gases composition was analysed using a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and results are shown in supplementary material S4. The results showed that pyrolysis gas comprised hydrogen (H2), carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), and lower hydrocarbons (C2 ~ C3) gases. Among different gases, pyrolysis gases contain a maximum quantity of carbon dioxide i.e., about 36.53%. The reason may be because of the thermal decomposition of C–O and –COOH functional groups combined with the water gas shift reaction effect (Gao et al., 2017). On the other hand, the concentrations of methane, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide gases were observed as 7.36%, 20.8%, and 8.74% respectively. In addition, some amounts of C2 ~ C3 gases (4.26%) were also detected in the pyrolysis gases. The existence of methane, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and C2 ~ C3 gases constitutes about 41.16% of total pyrolysis gases composition. The observed value of pyrolysis gases composition was found similar to the studies reported by other investigators (Gao et al, 2017, 2020). The presence of combustible gases such as CH4, CO, H2, and C2 ~ C3 confirm that pyrolysis gas has a good potential to use as a fuel candidate in spark-ignition (SI) engines/industry boilers/power plants or can be recycled to heat the reactor to improve total output energy of the process."
10,Kinetic parameter estimation,"3.4 Kinetic parameter estimation The estimation of the kinetic parameters is very useful for the effective design and scaling of industrial-scale process reactors (Masawat et al., 2019; Naqvi et al., 2019). Therefore, thermogravimetric data of pyrolysis of sewage sludge was analysed used a distinctive model that involves heat and mass transfer phenomena. Kinetic parameters were evaluated using a model-based method for sewage sludge at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and presented in Table 4 . It is observed from the coefficient of determination R2 in Table 4, limiting surface reaction significantly influenced the pyrolysis data obtained from TGA, and chemical reaction with first-order also influence the thermo-analytical data than that of the other random nucleation and diffusion-reaction mechanisms. The optimal model may be selected based on linear fitting of the interstitial solid reaction kinetic models and the value of R2 for each model. It is assumed that the mechanism model having the value of R2 closer to 1 represents the most appropriate model (Naqvi et al., 2019). However, this is not a hard and fast rule. To determine Arrhenius parameters, g(α) was assumed to depend on both T and t. The Coats-Redfern method can be easily coordinated with TGA pyrolysis data at the cost of disparity between the assumed method and the true models that are chosen (Table 4). Due to the same reason, the kinetic parameters obtained using this method provide ambiguity and other reasons are the existence of multi-reaction mechanism with different activation energies. However, average activation energy values are reported in Table 4. In chemical reaction models, first, second and third orders showed 27.52, and 30.02, 34.89 kJ mol−1 activation energy with pre-exponential factor A of 205.31, 208.12, and 201.7 min−1 respectively. The highest activation energy (59.21 kJ mol−1) was examined by the diffusion three-way transport model while the lowest activation energy (11.33 kJ mol−1) was observed by the random nucleation and nuclei growth three-dimensional model. On the other hand, the Pre-exponential factor, A was maximum (264.64 min−1) and lowest (200.6 min−1) for diffusion two-way transport and random nucleation and nuclei growth two-dimensional model. However, the regression coefficient (R2) was observed closer to unity (0.984) for the first-order reaction model/mechanism with an activation energy of 27.52 kJ mol−1 and a pre-exponential factor of 205.31 min−1 respectively. Therefore, it may be a suitable reaction mechanism for pyrolysis reactions. The results are found to be similar to other studies (Naqvi et al., 2019) who performed the detailed kinetics and thermodynamic analysis of high ash SS using the Coats-Redfern method."
11,Practical applications and future research prospects,"3.5 Practical applications and future research prospects Sewage sludge has raised an increasing concern due to its large production and potential risks for human health and the environment. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), anticipated sewage generation from Class I cities and Class II towns (as of the 2001 census) is 29129 MLD, with a current estimate of 33212 MLD assuming a 30 % decadal increase in urban population. The present manuscript explores the management and energy potential of sewage sludge through pyrolysis technology which not only solves the problems of landfilling but also converted them into valuable products such as fuel, chemicals, and organic manure. Bio-oil can be used as a fuel in boilers or can be converted into transportation fuel. Pyrolysis gases have the potential to be used as fuels in SI engines, whereas SS biochar can be used as an absorbent, a catalyst, or as solid fuels directly (Fig. 5 ). Furthermore, employing the Coats-Redfern approach, this work investigates the kinetic study of sewage sludge pyrolysis. These kinetic parameters could be useful for large-scale production since understanding the kinetics of thermal degradation of biomass is necessary for reactor design and optimization."
12,Conclusions,"The present work analyses the pyrolysis of sewage sludge in a fixed-bed reactor and kinetics at different temperatures using the thermogravimetric analyser. The results demonstrated that products derived from the pyrolysis of sewage sludge are organic substances such as bio-oil, pyrolysis gases along with valuable biochar. Both the bio-oil and pyrolysis gases can be utilised as a fuel in CI and SI engines, depending on their chemical composition and physico-chemical properties. The inclusion of several inorganic elements in biochar, such as C, N, K, P, Fe, Mg, Ca, and Na, indicates its suitability for using as organic manure. The Coats-Redfern method was used to conduct a kinetic analysis of sewage sludge pyrolysis, which revealed that the first-order reaction is the most suited reaction mechanism, with an activation energy of 27.52 kJ mol−1. In the future, it would be good to look into finding a suitable catalyst to improve the quality and quantity of bio-oil and pyrolysis gas."
