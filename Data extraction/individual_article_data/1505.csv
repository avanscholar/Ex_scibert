0,Introduction,"Selective hydrogenation is an important process both in homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. Its primary target is the hydrogenation of a specific unsaturated bond (e.g., CC, CC or CO), while leaving other unsaturated bonds within the molecule (or in other molecules) unaffected [1]. The selective hydrogenation of a CC bond or a CO bond in a molecule with both a CC bond and a CO bond is important for the preparation of fine chemicals and is of academic interest [2]. The catalytic selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to the saturated aldehydes is one example. Platinum catalyst is known to be one of the most effective catalysts for this selective hydrogenation. However, such selective reactions become quite problematic when the carbon–carbon double bond of an a,b-unsaturated aldehyde is conjugated both to a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring. Catalytic hydrogenation is one of the most useful, versatile, and environmentally acceptable reaction routes available for organic synthesis, and the reaction is usually carried out in a liquid-phase using batch type slurry processes and a supported noble metal (Pd, Pt, or Rh) catalyst [3–6]. Major advantages of multi-phase catalytic reactions using solid catalysts include easy separation of catalysts and products, easy recovery and catalyst recycling, and relatively mild operating conditions [7,8]. The performance of noble metal catalysts in liquid-phase hydrogenation is found to be dependent on several factors such as liquid composition (substrate structure, solvent effect, etc.), catalyst nature (active sites composition and morphology, support effect, modifiers, etc.), and reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, etc.) [9]. In the production of fine chemicals over heterogeneous catalysts, the choice of the solvent has a crucial impact; a bad selection of the solvent leads to a complete loss of selectivity and/or activity, thus destroying the possible utilization of a potentially efficient process in practice. Therefore, the choice of a solvent and the understanding of solvent effects are of central importance and thus require a careful investigation. Solvent effects are widely studied and the phenomena known as solvent effects cover a very broad topic [10,11]. The effects rising from the use of different solvents are observed as variations in activity, selectivity and stereoselectivity. However, several factors can be responsible for these variations, e.g., solubilities of liquid and gaseous reactants and their adsorption on the catalyst surface, competitive adsorption of solvent molecules, interaction of solvent with the reactant(s) either in the liquid-phase or on the catalyst surface as well as catalyst deactivation caused by the solvent [12]. Therefore, the phenomena understood under the label of solvent effects are a combination of very different physical and chemical phenomena and thus it is difficult to understand them completely. Ionic liquids (ILs) are attracting much interest in various areas of chemical synthesis, electrochemistry, separations and biotransformations, owing to their unique physicochemical characters [13,14]. Among these areas, catalysis in ILs is an exciting and burgeoning area of intense research and has been extensively reviewed recently [15–19]. It is reported that the use of ILs as reaction media for the catalytic transformations can have a profound effect on activity and selectivity. However, in the large majority of cases studied to date, ILs have been focused on the application in homogeneous catalysis or catalytic reactions in which catalysts were performed in situ, only a minority relates to catalysis using heterogeneous catalysts. Catalytic hydrogenation reactions have exactly the same circumstances as other catalysis, as far as we know, only a few works done about the heterogeneous hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes in ILs using supported metal catalysts and most of them found better selectivity for the reduction of conjugated CC bond by using ILs as solvents compared with conventional molecular organic solvents [20–27]. Currently, most of the data available about RTILs focus on bulk physical properties, such as phase transitions, viscosity and density, and on the correlation between these properties and the molecular structure of the RTILs. Little is known about the microscopic physical properties of these new materials and how to predict the influence of these solvents on chemical reaction rates. Such understanding would give the necessary information to synthesize new RTILs with precisely tailored properties for every chemical reaction. RTILs can replace molecular solvents only if they can be compared to the generally used reaction media. Therefore, it is necessary to understand how the RTILs are able to affect organic reactivity. In addition, one of the largest barriers to the application of RTILs arises from their high viscosity which may produce a reduction in the rate of many organic reactions. Several attempts have been made to improve the properties of RTILs, including the search for new and unusual RTILs in addition to ‘green’ cosolvents such as water, ethanol, and supercritical CO2. Unfortunately, no data has been reported on the ability of these mixtures in affecting organic reactivity [28]. Hence, the study of the effects of ionic liquid altering physicochemical properties on solute species and their reactions using molecular solvents is becoming an increasingly active area of research [29,30]. In continuing our investigations into solvent effects on rate of organic reactions [31–36], we focused on the effect of the IL on the activity and selectivity for CC and CO hydrogenation in alcoholic solvents at 25°C (use of acetone hydrogenation to propan-2-ol and cyclohexene hydrogenation to cyclohexane as model reactions). Platinum catalysts supported on Al2O3 prepared by the impregnation method are used for this reaction. The catalysts have been characterized by nitrogen adsorption at 77K and XRD methods."
1,Experimental,"Ethanol was obtained from Merck, propan-1-ol from Fluka and ethanolamine and formic acid from Riedel de Haen. The chemicals were of the highest purity available and purified according to the literature [37]."
2,Ionic liquid synthesis,"2.1 Ionic liquid synthesis The RTIL was prepared as described in literature [38]. 2-Aminoethanol (59.9g, 0.1mol) was placed in a three-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser, a dropping funnel and a thermometer. The flask was mounted in an ice bath. Under vigorous stirring with a magnetic stirrer, 38ml (0.1mol) formic acid was added dropwise to the flask in about 45min. Stirring was continued for 24h at room temperature to obtain a colorless viscous clear liquid. The RTIL was identified via H-NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy as described elsewhere [38] and it was degassed for 2h in vacuum (0.3mbar at 80°C) before use. 2-Hydroxy ethyl ammonium formate, as a new ionic liquid, is miscible with water and small alcohols and phase separation cannot be observed even for weeks [38]. Mixed solvents were prepared by carefully mixing the components by weight. Karl Fischer titrations showed no detectable presence of water in freshly synthesized RTIL. Solvatochromic parameters were obtained from our previous work [31]. Concentration measurements were taken on a HP6890 gas chromatograph (GC) with 60m HP5 column."
3,Catalyst preparation,2.2 Catalyst preparation Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared impregnating alumina with excess liquid. The impregnation solution was prepared by dissolving 500mg PtCl2 (Merck) in 30ml deionized water and 10ml HCl (Merck). 5g of γ-alumina was added to the impregnation solution and stirred for 30min. The impregnated solid was separated by decantation of the solution and dried at 100°C for 12h. The catalyst was reduced in hydrogen flow (120ml/min) at 400°C for 1h and was characterized with XRD and BET methods.
4,Catalyst characterization,2.3 Catalyst characterization Specific area and porosity were obtained from nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77K performed in an automatic Quantachrom apparatus (Model Quantasorb) with Belsorp adsorption/desorption data analysis software in the 0.05–0.995 relative pressure ranges. BET surface area was calculated from a linear part of the BET plot according to IUPAC recommendations. Pore size distributions were calculated from the N2 adsorption branch using the Horvath–Kawazoe model. Mean pore diameter and total pore volume (P/P 0 =0.99) were calculated from BET plot by Belsorp adsorption/desorption data analysis software. XRD pattern of the catalyst was carried out from 4° to 70° (2θ) using a Brruker D4 X-ray diffractometer operating at 40kV and 30mA with Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.542Å) and a Ni filter. Counts were accumulated every 0.02 (2θ) at a scan speed of 1° (2θ/min) in 25°C.
5,Catalytic test,"2.4 Catalytic test In a typical run, a solution of reagents in solvent (0.2g cyclohexene and 0.3g acetone in 20ml solvent) was added to 50ml three-necked flask attached to a thermometer, a condenser and a hydrotreator (including a hydrogen cylinder, hydrogen flowmeter and valves). After replacing the air in the flask completely with hydrogen, 0.02g of alumina supported platinum was added. The reaction mixture was stirred vigorously with a magnetic stirrer (1250rpm) and was kept at desired temperature (25°C). During the reaction, 1μl of reaction mixture (at least 6 times in a kinetic run) was taken and injected to the GC (60m HP-5 column, film thickness 1μm, inside diameter 0.25mm and FID detector). The surface area of the reactant peak in GC chromatogram was used for detection of concentrations in reaction mixture (with calibration curve). The RTIL was decomposed in the injector of GC (temperature 220°C) and gives several peaks in 12–15min in the GC chromatogram, but did not influence the reactant peak that appeared in 5.4min in our temperature program for GC oven. The absorption of hydrogen in ionic liquid was carried out under magnetic stirring (1250rpm) at a pressure of 1atm and at room temperature (25°C) by passing a gas stream (20ml/min) via a finely sintered glass frit through 20g of degassed (0.3mbar, 2h at 80°C) ionic liquid loaded into 100ml three-necked flask. The temperature was controlled with NESLAB RTE-8 thermometer. After 30min, 1μl of the mixture was injected to the GC (HP-5 column, TCD detector) and the amount of dissolved hydrogen was determined by comparing the H2 peak area with the calibration curve. The adsorption of acetone and cyclohexene on catalyst surface in solvent mixtures was carried out under magnetic stirring (1250rpm) at a pressure of 1atm and at room temperature (25°C) by injecting the solution before and after adding the catalyst (0.02g) to 20g solvent including 0.2g cyclohexene and 0.3g acetone in 100ml round button flask."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The catalyst reduced at 400°C exhibits the fcc (Face Cubic Centered) XRD pattern with peaks at 2θ =41.02, 46.48, and 67.88. The average crystallite size, L of the catalyst particle, was determined by XRD line broadening technique using Scherrer's equation, L =0.94λ/bcos θ; in which λ is the wavelength of X-ray and b is the relative peak broadening. The crystallite size of Pt particles was obtained to be 5.8nm. In addition, the mean diameter of pores obtained from BET plot and pore size distribution was 8.05 and 2.45nm, respectively. The BET surface area and the total pore volume (P/P 0 =0.990) of the supported Pt catalyst was 373.7m2 g−1 and 0.7519cm3/g, respectively."
8,Hydrogen solubility,"3.2 Hydrogen solubility Ionic liquids have been demonstrated to be excellent solvents for many reactions involving gaseous reactants entering RTIL solution; such as hydrogenation, hydroformilation, and oxidation. The solubility of gases in RTILs depends markedly on the type of RTILs [39,40]. In contrast with other ionic liquids, H2 is well dissolved in 2-hydroxy ethylammonium formate. In Fig. 1 , one can see that the addition of the RTIL to ethanol and propan-1-ol increases the hydrogen solubility in the media. Maximum H2 solubility was observed in the pure ionic liquid."
9,Adsorption of reactants on catalyst,"3.3 Adsorption of reactants on catalyst In order to demonstrate the relationship between adsorption of reactants on the catalyst in the media, we investigated the adsorption of cyclohexene and acetone on Pt/Al2O3 (Figs. 2 and 3 ). As can be seen, adsorption of cyclohexene and acetone on the catalyst increase with addition of the RTIL to ethanol and propan-1-ol. Also, behavior of the acetone adsorption is similar to the cyclohexene. In both RTIL–alcohol mixtures, extent of cyclohexene adsorption is higher than the acetone. Molecules of cyclohexene do not have polar group, then there is no reasonable interaction of the media. For this reason, tendency of cyclohexene molecules to surface of the catalyst is higher than that of acetone. Due to this non-polar nature, its tendency to the surface was increased with increasing the polarity of the media (Table 1 ). In order to obtain the relationship between reactants adsorption and the solvatochromic parameters of media, we used multi-parameter linear regression (MLR) method. The results show that adsorption of the reactants on the catalyst has negative correlation with the solvent basicity (β) parameter and adsorption of acetone and cyclohexene was decreased with increasing the basicity of the media. Also, dipolarity/polarizibility (π*) of the media has positive correlation with adsorption of the reactants. But the correlation with β parameter is better than π*(in cyclohexene adsorption for all mixtures: r =0.931 and in acetone adsorption for all mixtures: r =0.968). Negative effect of β extent of the adsorption can be explained by competitive adsorption of solvent molecules on the catalyst surface. The basic solvent can be adsorbed better than the acidic solvent and can fill the active sites on the catalyst surface. Cyclohexene is a very weak base molecule compared to acetone, thus the influence of the β parameter is stronger for cyclohexene adsorption in comparison to the acetone molecules."
10,Solvent effects on the reaction kinetics,"3.4 Solvent effects on the reaction kinetics The first-order rate constants of the reaction in mixtures of the RTIL with ethanol and propan-1-ol were obtained in various mole fractions of the RTIL at 25°C. The reaction rate constants were calculated by plotting the logarithm of concentration of cyclohexene vs. time and are summarized in Table 1. The solvatochromic parameters for mixtures of the RTIL with ethanol and propan-1-ol at various compositions have been determined in our laboratory (Table 1). Figs. 4 and 5 demonstrate plot of the reaction rate constant vs. mole fraction of the RTIL. As can be seen, rate constant of the reaction increases with mole fraction of the RTIL. First-order rate constant of the hydrogenation reaction in the RTIL is approximately 8.7 and 3.3 times higher than propan-1-ol for cyclohexene and acetone, respectively. Although, the normalized polarity parameter ( E T N ) of the RTIL is higher than those of ethanol and propan-1-ol and it increases with mole fraction of the RTIL, but single-parameter correlations of log k vs. E T N do not give acceptable results in the solutions (in cyclohexene hydrogenation for ethanol–RTIL mixtures: r =0.6025, for propan-1-ol–RTIL mixtures: r =0.735 and for all mixtures: r =0.684 and in acetone hydrogenation for ethanol–RTIL mixtures: r =0.570, for propan-1-ol–RTIL mixtures: r =0.778 and for all mixtures: r =0.627). Normalized polarity parameter is blend of π* (dipolarity/polarizability) and α (hydrogen-bond donor acidity) of the media [41,42]. Therefore, correlations of log k vs. π* and α in the solutions were considered. Hydrogen-bond donor acidity (α) parameter of the media first increases with increasing the mole fraction of the molecular solvent and then decreases. In fact in all cases the synergistic effect is obvious for α parameter near the pure molecular solvents. This behavior is different from the continuously increase in log k vs. X IL. Single-parameter correlation of log k vs. α does not give good results in the solutions (in cyclohexene hydrogenation for ethanol–RTIL mixtures: r =0.506, for propan-1-ol–RTIL mixtures: r =0.234 and for all mixtures: r =0.333 and in acetone hydrogenation for ethanol–RTIL mixtures: r =0.547, for propan-1-ol–RTIL mixtures: r =0.174 and for all mixtures: r =0.375). The dipolarity/polarizibility parameter (π*) increases continuously with the RTIL mole fraction in all mixtures. Single-parameter correlations of log k vs. π* give acceptable results in the solutions as demonstrated in Eqs. (1)–(4): • for acetone hydrogenation in ethanol–RTIL mixture: (1) log k = − 7.272 ( ± 0.171 ) + 2.074 ( ± 0.201 ) π * ( n = 11 , r = 0.960 , S.E. = 0.1227 , F 1,10 = 106.74 ) • for acetone hydrogenation in propan-1-ol–RTIL mixture: (2) log k = − 7.051 ( ± 0.076 ) + 2.037 ( ± 0.091 ) π * ( n = 11 , r = 0.991 , S.E. = 0.0564 , F 1,10 = 498.55 ) • for cyclohexene hydrogenation in ethanol–RTIL mixture: (3) log k = − 6.689 ( ± 0.235 ) + 2.900 ( ± 0.275 ) π * ( n = 11 , r = 0.962 , S.E. = 0.1682 , F 1,10 = 110.98 ) • for cyclohexene hydrogenation in propan-1-ol–RTIL mixture: (4) log k = − 7.229 ( ± 0.117 ) + 3.413 ( ± 0.141 ) π * ( n = 11 , r = 0.992 , S.E. = 0.0843 , F 1,10 = 587.37 ) where n, r, S.E., and F are number of data, regression coefficient, standard error and statistical Fisher number, respectively. As can be seen, first-order rate constant of the reactions increases with dipolarity/polarizability parameter of media in the mixtures of the RTIL with the molecular solvents. Linear correlation of log k vs. π* gives acceptable result in all solutions for hydrogenation of acetone: (5) log k = − 7.136 ( ± 0.132 ) + 2.025 ( ± 0.157 ) π * ( n = 21 , r = 0.945 , S.E. = 0.1343 , F 1,10 = 166.85 ) Also, similar result is obtained for hydrogenation of cyclohexene in all solutions: (6) log k = − 6.974 ( ± 0.146 ) + 3.171 ( ± 0.174 ) π * ( n = 21 , r = 0.971 , S.E. = 0.1489 , F 1,10 = 333.25 ) The values of log k do not show an acceptable dual-parameter correlation with the solvatochromic parameters. Furthermore, three-parameter correlations of log k vs. β, α, and π* did not give reasonable results and the equations reduced to single-parameter correlations with dipolarity/polarizability of the media. Thus, the best model is a single-parameter correlation of log k vs. π*. In the liquid-phase reactions, an increase in solvent polarity results in an increase in the rates of certain reactions in which the charge density is greater in the activated complex than the reactants [42]. In heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation, the reaction occurs on the surface of the catalyst (far from bulk of solvent). Then the solvent cannot directly affect the energetic level of reactants and activated complex of the reactions. Polar solvents increase the adsorption of non-polar substrates on the catalyst while non-polar solvents facilitate the adsorption of polar species [43]. However, in some cases, hydrogenation activity decreases with increasing solvent polarity due to competitive adsorption of high polar solvent and substrate on the catalyst surface [44,45]."
11,Solvent effects on the reaction selectivity,"3.5 Solvent effects on the reaction selectivity We define the selectivity of the reaction as the ratio of the rate constant for cyclohexene relative to the acetone: (7) S = k cycl. k acet. There are many studies on the selectivity of CC and CO bonds [46–48]. Solvent effects on the selectivity of the reaction are studied in details but many of them are in homogeneous phase [49–53]. As can be seen in Fig. 6 , selectivity of CC bond hydrogenation was increased with increasing mole fraction of the RTIL. Maximum selectivity was observed in the RTIL. As we mentioned before, the dipolarity/polarizibility (π*) of the solvent is the main parameter in reaction rate constant. Also, dependence of hydrogenation rate constant for cyclohexene to π* of the media is more than acetone (first-order rate constant of the reaction in the RTIL is approximately 8.7 and 3.3 times higher than propan-1-ol for cyclohexene and acetone respectively), thus changes of k cycl. with π* of media is more than k acet. values. For this reason, the selectivity of the reaction to cyclohexene hydrogenation increases with increasing the π* of the media and addition of the RTIL."
12,Conclusion,"Rate constants of synchronous heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of cyclohexene and acetone in mixtures of an RTIL with ethanol and propan-1-ol were determined at 25°C. In both mixtures, the reaction rate constant and selectivity for cyclohexene hydrogenation increase with increasing mole fraction of the RTIL. It was demonstrated that dipolarity/polarizibility of the media has an important role in determining solvent effects on the reaction rate constant and the selectivity. This was attributed to the non-polar nature of the reactants. The reactants tendency to the catalyst surface increases by increasing the dipolarity/polarizibility of media and thus the reaction rate increases. In conclusion, the reaction rate constant and the selectivity for heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation in mixtures of a RTIL with molecular solvents are correlated to the solvatochromic parameters of media."
