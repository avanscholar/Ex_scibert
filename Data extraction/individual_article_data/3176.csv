0,Introduction,"Biomass is the fourth largest primary energy resource available after coal, crude oil, and natural gas that can be used as an alternative in the current energy crisis [1]. In conjunction with environment deterioration and fluctuating crude oil price, the development of cheap and clean energy sources as sustainable energy resources are prioritized to overcome fossil-fuel dependency. Agricultural residues are potential biomass wastes that can be used for energy conversion based on advantages such as they are cheap, sustainable, and could solve waste disposal problems. Palms are among the most successful commercial crops in the Southeast Asian region (Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand), where the tropical climate and fertile land support vast plantation areas for palm cultivation and high oil production. A growing demand for palm oil utilization, mainly as edible oil, and other oil-related industries such as oleochemical and biodiesel production boost commercial oil production. Malaysia is the second largest palm oil producer in the world with an overall production capacity of 18.8 million tonnes of crude palm oil from its 5.08 million hectares of cultivation [2]. The growing palm oil industry produces a large amount of byproducts from the extraction mills including empty palm fruit bunches (EFBs), fibers, shells, and palm oil mill effluents (POMEs). Generally, solid wastes are used as a boiler fuel to produce electricity and the required steam for the oil extraction process [3]. The high moisture content of EFBs (65%) is a major drawback of the material for downstream processes (combustion, gasification, and pyrolysis), and drying is essential in order to achieve a minimum moisture level <10% [4,5]. POME is the effluent water discarded from oil extraction mills, which contains about 95–96% water with suspended solids, oils, and grease [6]. EFBs are rich in inorganic content, such as K2O, SO3, CaO, SiO2, Cl, Fe2O3, P2O3, MgO, and some trace elements that are returned to the soil as organic fertilizer through the mulching process [3]. However, high transportation costs from the mills to the plantation fields, distribution hurdles on uneven field’s topography, and lower benefits compared to the cost of mulching makes the process inefficient [7]. Conventionally, in Malaysia, POME is treated through a ponding system, which comprises a de-oiling tank, acidification ponds, as well as anaerobic and aerobic ponds, in which the quantities of ponds are based on the capacity of the mill [8,9]. Anaerobic degradation of POME under bacterial digestion releases a huge amount of biogas (CH4 and CO2) to the atmosphere, which contributes to global warming [8]. In Malaysia, almost 50% of POME treatment plants fail to capture the biogas, owing to inadequate implied systems. There are several technical barriers that have been identified in upgrading the current systems, such as high investment cost, inefficient technology, lack of law enforcement, and the uncertainty surrounding the biogas composition, as the POME properties vary seasonally [10]. Thus, our investigation focused on hydrogen production using palm waste materials through supercritical water gasification (SCWG). SCWG is an emerging technique that is a suitable for the conversion of high-moisture-content biomass into hydrogen-rich product gases [11]. There are specific characteristics of water under supercritical conditions (T ⩾374°C and P ⩾220bar), such as a low dielectric constant, thermal conductivity, ion product, viscosity, and density, making it an excellent reaction medium for biomass conversion [12]. Furthermore, Kelly-Yong et al. [13] have postulated the potential of palm biomass utilization in SCWG and have theoretically proven the feasibility of the process to obtain hydrogen as a renewable energy source. Hence, EFBs have been selected as a feedstock, and we are unaware of any similar studies of its utilization in combination with the SCWG reaction. In addition, we investigate the possibilities of POME conversion through SCWG as feedstock in comparison to water for EFB gasification."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The EFBs were obtained from local palm oil extraction mills in Johor, Malaysia. The EFBs were dried and ground to particle sizes <250μm. All lignocellulosic model compounds (xylan-X4252, cellulose-C6288, and lignin-370959) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Xylan was used as a model compound to replicate hemicellulose. The POME was collected from a ponding tank that stores liquid wastes discarded from the mill sites. Demineralized EFBs were prepared by washing with deionized water for 20h before they were dried overnight in oven [14]."
3,Methods,"2.2 Methods The SCWG reactions were performed in a custom-made reactor system (Fig. 1 ) using stainless-steel tubing (SS-810-6-2, outside diameter=1/8in.) connected with one-way valves. The reactor cells for the experiments were made from stainless-steel tubing (SS-t8-049-6ME) with an outside diameter of 1/2in. and a total volume of 13mL. The reactor system was fixed with a Swagelok transducer (limitation 0–400atm) in order to measure the pressure inside the reactor cell. The product gases were trapped and collected using a 1mL luer lock gas-tight syringe. The collected gas was injected into a gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector (GC-TCD) equipped with Porapak Q and Mole Sieve columns for CO2, H2, CH4, and CO detection."
4,Experimental,"2.3 Experimental The experiments were carried out using 0.3g of the feedstock (EFBs/lignocellulosic model compounds) loaded into the reactor cell followed by 8mL of deionized water. The cell was connected to the reactor system and placed inside the GC oven. The oven temperature was increased from 30 to 380°C, ramping at 10°Cmin−1, and the reaction time was fixed at 8min. After completion of the reaction, the reactor was cooled and both valves were opened intermittently to release the product gas for collection in a gas-tight syringe. Then, the residues from the reactor cell were collected and dried for Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. A PerkinElmer FTIR spectrometer, model 100 series, was used (sample preparation UATR-Universal Attenuated Total Reflectance Sensor) to study the functional-group cleavages of the feedstock before and after the SCWG reaction. The lignocellulosic model compounds were used as a feedstock for the SCWG reaction in order to imitate the individual components of real biomass, so that we could study the decomposition patterns under our experimental setup. The effects of EFB loading and the reaction time on the product gas composition and carbon concentration in gas phase is studied. In addition, the possibility of using POME as a reactant medium was studied in terms of the SCWG reaction in comparison to deionized water."
5,Results and discussion,
6,SCWG of EFBs and lignocellulosic model compounds,"3.1 SCWG of EFBs and lignocellulosic model compounds EFBs are lignocellulosic compounds that are composed of hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin, with small amount inorganic substances. The behavior of each constituent under SCWG conditions was studied using pure hemicellulose (xylan), cellulose, and lignin. The product gas (H2, CO2, CH4, CO) distributions of the reactions enabled us to predict the decomposition patterns and possible reaction mechanism of the model compounds. Xu and Donald [15] postulated that the biomass decomposition under supercritical water involved in a series of complex reaction pathways, as stated in Eq. (1): (1) Biomass → Hydrolysis Solvolysis Intermediates → Fragmentation Cracking Gaseous products Intermediate compound degradations were predicted based on following reactions mechanisms, such as decarboxylation (Eq. (2)), decarbonylation (Eq. (3)), and fragmentation/cracking (Eq. (4)): (2) R - C ( O ) OH or R - C ( O ) O - R ′ ↔ R - H + CO 2 or R - R ′ + CO 2 (3) R - C ( O ) H or R - C ( O ) O - R ′ ↔ R - H + CO or R - R ′ + CO (4) R - CH 2 - CH 2 - CH 3 ↔ R - H + C 3 H 6 or R - CH 3 + C 2 H 4 or R - CH 2 ∗where R and R′ are possible functional groups. The results of the ultimate analysis and the calculated theoretical moles of feedstock used in the experiments are given in Table 1 . The product gas concentrations for each compound after the SCWG reaction are presented in Fig. 2 . Variation in the product gas concentration shows that intrinsic properties such as the thermal stability, functional groups, and chemical linkages in the model compound structures significantly influence the degradation and gas evolution patterns under supercritical reaction conditions. H2 and CO2 were found to be the most dominant gases released during SCWG of lignocellulosic model compounds. The participation of water as a reactant in the reaction contributes almost half of the H2 yield through the water gas shift reaction (WGS; Eq. (5)) [16]. In another study, using D2O as a reaction medium in SCWG organic of waste with RuO2 catalysts, it was found that all hydrogen sources in the gas phase originated from water [17]. Thus, the WGS reactions plays a major role in H2 production in the SCWG reaction, owing to the presence of excess water. (5) CO + H 2 O → H 2 + CO 2 Δ H = - 41 kJ mol - 1 Furthermore, CO and CO2 were found to be produced through the cleavage of functional groups such as carbonyl and carboxyl groups that are present in the basic subunits of all lignocellulosic compounds, according to Eqs. (2) and (3) [15]. Azadi et al. [11] reported that CH4 formation does not have pyrolytic routes and the main source is linked to methanation reactions (Eqs. (6) and (7)), which reduce H2 production with CO2 and CO. (6) CO + 3 H 2 → CH 4 + H 2 O Δ H = - 206.17 kJ mol - 1 (7) CO 2 + 4 H 2 → CH 4 + 2 H 2 O Δ H = - 165.01 kJ mol - 1 Among the samples, a higher amount of H2 was obtained from xylan compared cellulose and lignin. Xylan consists of d-xylose as monomeric units with some trace of compounds including l-arabinose, d-galactose, and d-mannose [18]. Hydrolysis of xylan follows chain-reaction mechanisms that form various compounds at different stages such as d-xylose, furfural, and finally formic acid [19]. Formic acid has been reported to be prone to decomposition into CO2 and H2 under hydrothermal condition at temperatures in the range of 350–500°C [20]. Thus, it proves that high H2 production is favored by the decomposition of formic acid that produced from xylan degradation. Furthermore, the higher H2 production compared to the theoretical value of xylan proves the participation of water in WGS reaction. In all experiments, there is no significant difference in the amount of CO2 concentration in the gas composition. However, CO and CH4 production shows notable variance between the samples. Interestingly, the highest amount of CO was observed with cellulose and the most CH4 was obtained from lignin. As seen earlier, CO is produced through the cleavage of functional groups and is consumed during WGS reactions. Thus, a plausible explanation for the highest CO concentration from cellulose is that it originates from the cracking of dissolved intermediates. Cellulose is a long-chain polymer compound made of β-d-glucopyranose monomers that are linked by (1→4) glycosidic bonds, which possess a high number of carbonyl and carboxyl functional groups in their structures [21]. Furthermore, using IR absorbance, Yang et al. [22] found that cellulose is rich in C–O and O–H groups compared to hemicellulose and lignin. Thus, an excess of these functional groups in cellulose could be the major source of CO production. Methanation was considered to be the sole source of methane, aided by presence of metallic catalysts [11]. However, a significant amount of methane produced was noticed in lignin decomposition compared to other employed feedstocks. Lignin is a polyaromatic compound that consists of p-hydroxyphenylpropanoid units bonded by C–C or C–O–C bonds and releases various phenolic compounds during hydrolysis reactions [23]. The cleavage of highly branched methoxyl groups (–O–CH3) was found in the dissolved phenolic compounds and elevates the amount of CH4 produced. In addition, a small amount of methane was also observed in hemicellulose and cellulose decomposition, possibly from the cracking of aliphatic structures. Fig. 3 summarizes the possible pathways of lignocellulosic compound degradation, using simplified chemical models. Thus, these possible pathways provide an overview of the conceivable reaction routes of EFB gasification in supercritical water. In real biomass applications, inorganic matter that is present in the feedstock also influences the product gas composition. EFBs contain various inorganic substances that are capable of catalyzing both reforming and cracking reactions. Catalytically active materials in EFBs enhance decomposition and elevate the H2 production by promoting hydrogen-favored reactions [14,24]. However, the presence of inorganic substances such as sulfur in feedstocks was linked to a reduction in carbon conversion and hydrogen yield [25]. In a comparison between raw and demineralized EFBs, the impact of these substances on H2 concentration was less significant, owing to the presence of other catalytically active materials that increase the H2/CO ratio by promoting the WGS reaction. The H2 concentration was found to be slightly higher for raw EFBs compared to demineralized EFBs, owing to the catalytic effects of the inorganic matter that promotes H2-favored reactions. In addition, CO concentration was higher for demineralized EFBs, which proves the lower tendency of WGS reactions in the absence of inorganic matter. Furthermore, the presence of inorganic species in biomass was found to have catalytic properties that increase hydrogen production [25,26]. Fig. 4 shows the FTIR analysis of the model compounds and EFBs before and after SCWG. The residues from the reactor cells were collected, except for xylan, which hardly formed a solid residue, but liquid, tarry compounds that stick to the reactor wall. The spectra reveal changes in the chemical structures of each compound and enable us to predict the possible functional group cleavages under these reaction conditions. A detailed FTIR analysis carried out by Yang et al. [22] found that lignocellulosic model compounds mainly consist of alkenes, esters, ketones, aromatics, and alcohols with variety of oxygenated functional groups. The intensity of the functional groups is greatly decreased and new peaks appear as a result of bond breaking and transformations in the structures after the reaction. Comparison of the spectra for cellulose and its residue shows the disappearance of peaks at 1022 [C–O (C6 skeletal vibration)], 1324.8 (C–C and C–O skeletal vibration), 1429.5 (CH2 bending), and 903cm−1 [β-glycosidic linkages (shoulder peak) are observed], with new peaks emerging at 1214.4 [C–O stretching (phenol)], 1596.3 (aromatic ring vibration), and 1682.8cm−1 (conjugated carbonyl groups with aromatic ring) [22,27–30]. These results suggest the depolymerization of the cellulose structure through β-glycosidic-bond cleavage and glucose monomer transformation into complex aromatic compounds under the reaction conditions. Residues of lignin show a significant reduction in the peak intensity at 1593 (aromatic ring vibration), 1499 (aromatic skeletal vibration), 1443 (O–CH3), and 1400–1000cm−1 (combination and overlapping of C–O stretching) compared to pure lignin [22,29,31]. The band at 1028cm−1 represents the C–O stretch caused by O–CH3 and C–OH, which disappear in the residue, owing to the elimination of the functional group during SCWG [29]. These findings support the CH4 production route to be mainly from the methoxyl group breaking in the absence of a catalyst, according to Eq. (8). Compared to all model compounds, EFBs show significant peaks at 2918 and 2853cm−1, which represent C–H n stretching (alkyl, aliphatic, aromatic), and all other functional groups were similar to the model compounds [22]. The residue of the EFBs shows a major reduction in the intensity of the functional groups and new peaks are observed in the regions of 900–700 and 700–400cm−1, which correspond to aromatic hydrogen vibrations and C–C stretching, respectively [22]. In conclusion, the product gas compositions for the feedstock are highly influenced by the chemical structure and functional groups that are present in the starting compounds. (8) R - O - CH 3 + H 2 O → R - OOH + CH 4 Table 2 summarizes the total carbon concentration in gas phase, reaction time, feedstock loading and CO2/CH4 ratio for all experimental reactions performed using EFBs and lignocellulosic model compounds. It was found that not all the carbon from the xylan, cellulose, and lignin were gasified and mainly remained in the reactor cell in the form of liquid tar and solid char. This is due to lower carbon conversions that are attributed to the absence of a catalyst and a lower reaction temperature (380°C), which are insufficient to crack the dissolved tarry matters. Antal [32] reported that reaction temperatures above 600°C are required to achieve complete carbon conversion with a H2-rich product gas. Furthermore, Yu et al. [33] obtained complete carbon conversion in SCWG by reducing the concentration of the feed (glucose, 0.1mol) at 600°C in the absence of a catalyst. Thus, thermally stable tar and char formation from the dissolved biomass during SCWG at 380°C restricts further degradation and gas formation. Besides, low carbon concentration in gas phase shows less improvement in carbon conversion with increasing the EFB loading and also there is no significant change in the CO2/CH4 ratio. Furthermore, similar observations were noticed with increasing reaction time where carbon concentrations are almost same due stable tar/char formation. However, CO2/CH4 ratio was found to be inversely proportional to reaction time, indicating progressive CH4 formation with time."
7,Effect of the ratio of EFB to water,"3.2 Effect of the ratio of EFB to water Water, as a reactant in SCWG, plays an important role in achieving higher gasification efficiency, whereby the ratio between water and EFBs was studied to attain optimum reaction conditions. Table 2 summarizes the amount of carbon concentration in gas phase during the SCWG reaction using various amounts of EFBs, from 0.05 to 0.5g in 8mL of deionized water at 380°C. The results show that the carbon concentration slightly increased from 0.05 to 0.2g and maintained with increasing EFB loading. Theoretically, carbon concentration in the gas phase should be increased with increasing EFB loading; however results indicate that after 0.3g of feedstock loading carbon concentration was constant due to lower tendency of carbon gasification. Increasing the feedstock loading enhanced the predominance of polymerization reactions over gasification, which reduces the amount product gas [34]. Similar to the model compounds decomposition patterns, EFBs also thermally decompose and dissolve to produce intermediates, where it is further degraded into gases and tarry compounds, with char as a solid residue. Lower loadings of the feedstock enabled high dilution of EFBs in the reaction medium, which prevents polymerization reactions and allows the bombardment of more ions (H+ and OH−) with dissolved substances. This shows that increasing feedstock concentration tend to reduce the gasification reaction. Even though slight increment in carbon concentrations were noticed from 0.05 to 0.2g, but the amount of loadings are too low compared to the feedstock concentration reported in literatures. Thus, 0.3g (3.75%) of EFB was selected as an appropriate feedstock concentration to perform SCWG reaction in the absence of catalysts at 380°C. Fig. 5 shows the gas distribution in the products of each reaction with different EFB loadings. The product gas was mainly composed of H2 and CO2 with very small amounts of CH4 and CO. The difference between the gaseous compositions enables us to predict the type of reaction mechanism favored during SCWG of EFBs. The amount of CO2 was found to increase slightly with increasing EFB loading up to 0.2g and it stayed relatively constant after that. CO2 is mainly produced from functional groups that are present in EFBs, which easily cleave under the reaction condition. Thus, at lower feedstock concentrations (0.05–0.2g) more cleavage of the functional groups occurred and elevated the CO2 production. However, at higher EFB loadings (0.3–0.5g), constant CO2 levels were observed as a result of dominant polymerization of the dissolved tar compared to functional group cleavage, which reduces the overall carbon conversion as indicated by the constant carbon concentration in gas phase. Furthermore, the WGS reaction plays an important role in H2 production, whereby CO is converted into CO2 with the splitting of H2O molecules. In addition, an experiment (not shown here) has been conducted with only water, without EFB addition, and it was found that no H2 or any other gas was produced. Thus, EFBs also act as a carbon source, which promotes the WGS reaction. The results indicated that H2 production increased greatly with increasing EFB loading up to 0.3g and the levels were maintained at 0.4 and 0.5g EFBs. Concurrently, CO reduction was also noticed with similar EFB loading patterns, which postulated the effect of the WGS reaction. As shown earlier, CH4 is mainly produced through the pyrolytic pathway rather than by methanation reactions. Pyrolytic cracking of the dissolved EFB intermediates contributes to CH4 production, possibly from the functional group (methoxyl) cleavage in lignin, which is part of EFBs, along with structural breaking in the aliphatic compounds. The methanation route is not possible under our reaction conditions, whereby the presence of suitable catalysts is required to facilitate the reaction [35]. Furthermore, the results shown here indicate that no reduction in the H2 was observed as a sign the methanation reaction and they support the pyrolytic pathway for CH4 production."
8,Effect of the SCWG reaction time of EFBs on the product gas composition,"3.3 Effect of the SCWG reaction time of EFBs on the product gas composition Based on the previous EFB loading, we proceeded with 0.3g of EFBs as an optimum amount for the study of the effect of reaction time on the overall gas production. The reaction time does not have a significant influence on the product gas evolved. Referring to Table 2, the carbon concentrations in the gas phase of each reaction are similar with increasing reaction times of 8–32min. This is attributed to the formation of stable, tarry compounds at 380°C, which are difficult to degrade, even with increasing reaction times. Similar observations have been reported by Afif et al. [25] in their investigation into the catalytic hydrothermal gasification of activated sludge. Carbon conversion does not proceed after 30min, owing to the stable, tarry material and catalyst deactivation. Early stage increments of carbon conversion in the study by Afif et al. were most probably caused by catalytic activity, whereas in our study, in the absence of catalyst, there is no improvement at all after 8min. Fig. 6 shows the product gas composition for EFBs with increasing SCWG reaction time. H2 shows a moderate increment with increasing reaction time as a result of the progressing WGS reaction (Eq. (5)). In addition, CO2 concentration also shows an increasing trend in the following order of 12.5, 13.0, 13.5–13.7mmol/mL with increasing reaction time. However, due to the scale of the graphs these differences are not viewable. Furthermore, the descending order of CO production with increasing reaction time supports the proposed reaction route. CH4 content is low in all experiments and has shown a gradual increment with increasing reaction time. The prolonged reaction time allows more pyrolytic cracking to take place in the formed intermediates and is responsible for the increasing amount of CH4. Muangrat et al. [36] reported similar observations in the subcritical gasification of glucose, molasses, and rice bran, whereby H2 and CH4 increased with reaction time from 0 to 120min."
9,POME as a reactant medium,"3.4 POME as a reactant medium The water source is a crucial element in SCWG, and deionized water has been found to be an effective reactant medium. An attempt to replenish the deionized water with POME was carried out in this investigation to study its potential as a reactant medium. POME is wastewater produced from palm oil extraction mills, and it consist of 95–96% water and organic content with some trace elements, as summarized in Table 3 [6]. Fig. 7 elucidates the SCWG results using POME as a reactant medium with EFB loadings of 0.05–0.5g. We also performed SCWG of POME without addition of EFBs, and gases including H2, CO, CH4, and CO2 were produced as the organic substances in the reactants were gasified under supercritical condition. In compare with deionized water (6.8–13.4mmol/mL) the concentration of CO2 was founded to be slightly higher for EFBs+POME gasification in range of 13.4–17.5mmol/mL while CO and CH4 production does not show any significant difference due to very low amount of production. Furthermore, addition of same amount of EFBs into POME will have slightly higher concentration than deionized water. This is due to EFBs loading (0.05–0.5g) into POME which causes an increment of feedstock concentration in the reaction medium (EFBs with organic substances in POME), which favors the polymerization reaction and concurrently could reduce carbon gasification, as we reported above, similar to deionized water. Thus, based on the obtained results, we found that POME behaves as a water source for SCWG and also as a feedstock where the organic content in the reactant tends to be gasified and produces a valuable gaseous product similar to EFBs. The addition of increasing EFB loadings with POME gradually increased H2 concentration up to 0.3g and then dropped with any further increase. This is attributed to the effect of various dissolved inorganic substances and a lack of homogeneity in POME, which could influence the WGS reaction significantly. Furthermore, variations in the gas composition, such as a reduction in H2, are followed by increments in the amount of CO as result of the lower tendency for the WGS reaction. In conclusion, POME has high potential to be used as a reactant medium for the SCWG reaction along with deionized water, whereby its own dissolved organic content tends to be gasified under the reaction conditions by releasing a notable amount of hydrogen-rich product gas."
10,Conclusions,"It was found that H2 was mainly produced through the water gas shift reaction and that the participation of water enhances the overall yield. The main source of CH4 originates from the pyrolytic cracking of methoxyl groups, rather than through the methanation reaction in the absence of a catalyst. Increasing biomass loading from 0.05 to 0.5g reduces the carbon gasification as shown by constant carbon concentration in gas phase, owing to the formation of stable, tarry compounds. In addition, similar observations were noted where no improvement in the carbon gasification with increasing reaction time. POME was found to have great potential as a reactant medium (water source), and is similar to deionized water for the SCWG reaction and as a feedstock. In the absence of EFBs, a significant amount of product gases were observed from the decomposition of organic substances that were present inside POME. Thus, palm mill waste that includes EFBs and POME has shown great potential to be utilized as a suitable feedstock for the SCWG reaction, owing to its abundance and the high moisture content of the material."
