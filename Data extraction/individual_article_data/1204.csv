0,Introduction,"Increasing energy supply is required by sustained economic development. It has been predicted that energy consumption will increase by 35% from 2014 to 2035, and fossil fuels accounts for around 80% of total energy supply [1]. The heavy dependence on fossil fuels has resulted in a series of environmental problems, like global warming, air pollution and acid rain etc. Furthermore, fossil fuel reserves can hardly meet the continuous growth in demand. By the end of 2015, the increase of explored fossil fuel reserves was much lower than the increase of production [2]. Thus, to solve the energy crisis and environmental degradation, exploration of clean and renewable energy alternatives is necessary. Quite a few renewable energy sources have been explored, like solar energy, wind energy, tidal energy and so on. However, the facilities for energy collection are usually in remote regions, and energy supply is heavily dependent on climate, leading to the high cost of energy storage and transportation. Hydrogen owns several benefits as a promising fuel candidate: 1) it has the highest energy yield of 142.35 kJ/g; 2) it is totally clean with water as sole production; 3) easy storage and transportation; 4) the rapid development of fuel cell technology further facilitates the application of hydrogen. Hydrogen can be produced through many methods ( Fig. 1), and currently, most hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels [3]. However, to maintain a sustainable development of hydrogen society, hydrogen production from renewable sources attracts more attention. Biological hydrogen production is broadly studied for its mild reaction condition and high potential environmental benefits. With higher hydrogen production rate, simpler reactor construction and independency of light, dark fermentation is preferred [4]. Dark fermentative hydrogen production was studied in 1970s, in which hydrogen was produced from glucose by immobilized Clostridium butyricum [5]. Then, lots of studies were conducted focusing on various aspects of dark fermentation, like the selection of inoculum, optimization of operational conditions, utilization of various substrates, analysis of metabolic pathways, metabolic engineering and reactor design. For the further application of fermentative hydrogen production, the increase of the hydrogen production efficiency and the decrease of the operational cost are essential. Biomass wastes can be supplied as low-cost substrate for dark fermentative hydrogen production, which significantly reduces the hydrogen production cost [6–8]. Furthermore, hydrogen production from biomass supplies dual benefits of energy generation and wastes treatment, since agricultural and municipal wastes can be deposed at the same time. Biomass refers to the organic matters derived from living, or recently living organisms. Biomass concerned in this paper comprises waste activated sludge, algae biomass and cellulose-base biomass. During the dark fermentation process, complex biomass is firstly disintegrated into soluble matters, which mainly include proteins, carbohydrates and lipids. Then, these molecules are further hydrolyzed to smaller molecules like amino acids, monosaccharaides and long chain fatty acids. Then, it comes to the acidogenesis and acetogenesis process, besides the target product H2, a wide range of intermediates and byproducts include soluble metabolites and CO2 are formed. The terminal liquid products are mainly composed of acetate acid, butyrate acid, ethanol and propionic acid. The composition depends on microbial species, fermentation conditions as well as substrate sources and pretreatment process ( Fig. 2). However, there are several bottlenecks for the application of fermentative hydrogen production from biomass-based materials, such as low hydrogen production efficiency and low substrate degradation rate. Composition of biomass is complex, while anaerobic cultures are inefficient in hydrolyzing macromolecules. For example, cellulose materials are composed of complex networks, which are high resistant to biodegradation; most of organic matters are encapsulated in cells and not readily degradable; furthermore, it is necessary to further investigate various compositions of different biomass, to explore the suitable operations. To address the problem, proper pretreatment can be effective in promoting the disintegration and hydrolysis of biomass, thus enhancing the hydrogen production efficiency and substrate degradation simultaneously [9]. During the pretreatment process, complex structures of biomass are collapsed, leaving free cells. Then, cell walls and membranes are solubilized, releasing the trapped components. Subsequently, crystal and polymeric structures of macromolecules are destroyed, generating molecules readily available for hydrogen producers. Extensive studies have verified the enhancing effect of pretreatment on hydrogen production from biomass [10–13]. Application of biomass in bio-hydrogen production is a promising way for sustainable energy generation. Thus, the objective of this review is to provide an insight on (1) characteristics and feasibilities of biomass as feedstock for dark fermentation; (2) the pretreatment methods used for enhancing the conversation of biomass to hydrogen through dark fermentation; (3) the present status of hydrogen yield from differently treated biomass; (4) suggestions for further studies. Overall, the present review paper will provide (1) the recent progress in pretreatment methods for lignocellulosic biomass to hydrogen conversion by dark fermentation; (2) the attempts that have been made to reach sufficient cellulose hydrolysis; (3) the detoxification methods for the inhibitor removal along with their mechanism lethal to the bacterial cells; (4) continuous reactor operation aspects and (5) valorization and utilization of the unhydrolyzed biomass resulted from the pretreatment process."
1,Types of biomass used for hydrogen production,"Biomass refers to the organic matters derived from living, or recently living organisms. Biomass has been considered as an important energy source for it can be efficiently converted to energy through a series of physical or chemical methods. Among all the conversion processes, biological hydrogen production process is preferred for its mild reaction condition, economic feasibility and environmental benefits. Waste activated sludge, algae biomass and cellulose-based biomass have been studied as feedstock for fermentative hydrogen production."
2,Waste activated sludge,"2.1 Waste activated sludge Biological wastewater treatment process is the most widely used wastewater treatment process. During this process, organic matters present in wastewater are turned in to CO2 and microbial biomass. With the increasing amount of wastewater produced, large amount of waste activated sludge is formed. Waste activated sludge is a kind of solid-liquid mixture with water content of 95–99.5%. Its composition can be categorized into 4 groups: 1) nontoxic carbon sources, mainly composed of microbial cells and extracellular polymeric substances. It accounts for around 60–70% of total dry weight; 2) inorganic nutrients include nitrogen- and phosphorous-containing compounds; 3) toxic inorganic and organic pollutants, like heavy metals, pesticides, estrogens and pathogenic microorganisms etc.; 4) inorganic compounds like silicates, calcium- and magnesium-containing components [14]. Large amount, high water content and the present of poisonous substances make waste activated sludge treatment and dumping difficult and costly. The treatment of waste activated sludge usually composes over 50% of operating cost in wastewater treatment plant [15]. Treatment and disposal of waste activated sludge have become an urgent environmental problem [16]. Existing sludge disposal includes sanitary landfill, incineration, agricultural use like sludge compost [17], construction use like building materials [18], and energy recovery [19]. Considering the rich content of organic substances, waste activated sludge is receiving attention for its potential application for renewable fuel production [20–22]. Productions of biofuel include methane, hydrogen, syngas (H2 + CO) [23], bio-oil [24] and bio-diesel [25] from waste activated sludge have been explored. Among them, fermentative hydrogen production owns more environmental benefits and has a potential for sustainable development. However, up to now, the low yield of hydrogen during the fermentation process hinders its further application. To enhance the energy recovery efficiency, following studies have been conducted: 1) Pretreatment of waste activated sludge. Since most of organic matters are encapsulated in microbial cells, pretreatment is necessary to disrupt microbial membranes and release the organic substances. Thus, both energy recovery rate and sludge degradation rate can be significantly enhanced. Lin et al. [26] achieved 50.21% enhancement in hydrogen production through chemical treatment of waste activated sludge. Kuglarz et al. [27] reported 35% more biogas production with microwave treated sludge. 2) Supplementary carbon source. Proper C/N ratio can significantly enhance hydrogen production efficiency. Thus, adjusting C/N ratio of waste activated sludge through adding carbon sources like sugars and food wastes were explored. Both Kim et al. [28] and Liu et al. [29] increased hydrogen production through co-digestion of sludge with rice straw and food wastes, respectively. Yin and Wang [30–32] found that though the addition of glucose to fermentation system, reaction period, maximum hydrogen production rate and hydrogen yield were significantly enhanced. 3) Two/Three-stage fermentation. Dark fermentative hydrogen production was followed by photo fermentation and methane production, both hydrogen yield and energy recovery was improved [33]. Besides the above mentioned measurements, inoculation of robust hydrogen producers, optimization of both treatment conditions and operational conditions can also enhance hydrogen production process. Thus, with extensive explorations, waste activated sludge is a potential feedstock for hydrogen production."
3,Algae,"2.2 Algae Algae biomass are simple chlorophyll-containing organisms, which have high photosynthetic efficiency in converting atmosphere CO2 into a wide range of organic substances like proteins, polysaccharides and lipids [34]. Algae can be categorized into macroalgae and microalgae. General composition of macroalgae and microalgae used in fermentative hydrogen production is shown in Table 1. Macroalga is also known as seaweeds, prevalently present in marine ecosystem, and mainly grow on rocky substrates. They are excellent in producing and storing carbon sources because of their high growth rate and big size of up to 60 m in length [35]. Chemical compositions of macroalgae are affected by their culturing environment like light, temperature, salinity, pollution and motion of tides. Macroalgae have a high content of water, minerals and carbohydrates. Macroalgae can be divided into green algae, red algae and brown algae according to their different colors. Carbohydrates content of green algae ranges between 25% and 60%, which is mainly composed of mannan, ulvan, starch and cellulose. For the red algae, carbohydrates content is around 30–60%, which is dominated by carrageenan (up to 75%) and agar (up to 52%). As to brown algae, carbohydrates content varies between 30% and 50% and the main components include alginate, laminarin and cellulose [35–37]. Brown algae like Laminaria japonica has been widely studied as feedstock for anaerobic fermentation due to its high carbohydrates content and low requirement for pretreatment [38]. Microalgae are unicellular or simple-multicellular microorganisms. Microalgae are adaptive to various environment conditions, and can be cultivated in fresh water, seawater and wastewater. Components of microalgae vary according to their species and cultivation environment, distribution of biochemical fractions of a microalgae cell is as follows: proteins 40–60%, carbohydrates 5–60%, lipids 8–30%, and nucleic acids 5–10% [36,39]. Scenedesmus obliquus in particular is being used as fermentation substrate for its high level of glucose-based carbohydrates and high productivities [36]. Algae biomass is a kind of newly explored energy crop. They have many advantages, including: 1. Rapid growth rate. They can proliferate rapidly and be obtained in large amount easily. 2. Benefit to the environment. They are quite efficient in utilizing inorganic carbon sources to synthesize cell biomass, fixing CO2. Furthermore, they can be cultured in wastewater, which can be combined with wastewater treatment. 3. Strong adaptation to various environments without competing with fertile soils for agriculture. 4. High carbohydrate content which is helpful in enhancing the hydrogen production efficiency. 5. Lack of hemicellulose and lignin, thus, the required pretreatments can be milder. Alga has been used as feedstock for producing biodiesel [40], bioethanol [41–43] and biogas [39]. Chlorella sp., Scenedesmus sp. and Saccharina sp. were widely studied as feedstock for hydrogen production, and hydrogen yield of 0.4–760 mL H2/g volatile solids (VS) [44–46], 0.42–113.1 mL H2/g VS [47–49] and 23.4–159.6 mL H2/g total solids (TS) [50–53] were obtained, respectively. However, there still remain some obstacles hindering the wide application of algae as substrate for hydrogen production. For example, the problems associated with biomass culturing and harvesting. The efficient mass production of algae still needs to be developed; the cost of collection and concentration of algae biomass needs to be reduced [39]. Furthermore, since the components of algae are highly affected by cultivation environment, various compositions of differently cultured algae cause difficulties in choosing efficient treatment method, and also affect stable operation of hydrogen production system."
4,Cellulose-based biomass,"2.3 Cellulose-based biomass Cellulose-base biomass mainly comprises agricultural residuals and municipal wastes, like straws, stalks, forest residues, yard clippings, grass, wood chips and so on. Cellulose-based biomass is by far the most abundant raw materials, and their annual yields from all over the world are estimated to exceed 220 billion tons [54], equivalent to 60–80 billion tons of crude oil [55]. Thus, cellulose-based biomass is considered as a potential fuel source. Till now, it accounts for 14% of the world's energy supply, serving as the fourth largest source of energy after coal, petroleum and natural gas [56]. Cellulose-based biomass has been used as source for fuel generation through various ways like: biomass gasification [57], catalytic production of diesel fuels and value-added chemicals [58], fermentative production of ethanol [59], methane [60] and hydrogen [54] and so on. Biological conversion processes are preferred for their environmental benefits. Cellulose-based biomass is composed of three main biopolymers: cellulose (30–70%), hemicelluloses (15–30%) and lignin (10–25%), the specific composition varies along with different plant species ( Table 2). As the major component of cellulose-based biomass, cellulose has been verified to be biodegradable. However, cellulose is present in the form of cellulose–hemicellulose–lignin network. In this network, cellulose and lignin fibers are connected by hemicellulose, and hemicellulose is covalently bonded with lignin through lignin-carbohydrate complex [61]. Since lignin is a cross-linked network hydrophobic polymer, it is not only insoluble but resistant to biodegradation. Thus, lignin is the main hindering factor for fermentative hydrogen production from cellulose-based biomass. To enhance the digestibility of cellulose-based biomass, pretreatment methods are required to remove or solubilize the lignin present in cellulose-based biomass. Besides, pretreatment is also beneficial in reducing the crystallinity of cellulose and enlarging the available surface area, further enhance the biodegradability of cellulose-based biomass. Motte et al. [62] found that hydrogen yield from wheat straw can be significantly increased from 3.4 to 15.3 mL/g TS to 20–35 mL/g TS by grinding process. Ozkan et al. [63] also enhanced hydrogen production from sugar beet-pulp through various treatment methods. However, Kumar et al. [54] reviewed 22 studies about the effect of treatment on hydrogen production from lignocellulosic biomass, and concluded that the average hydrogen yields for treated and untreated biomass were quite similar."
5,Pretreatment of biomass-based materials,"Since low hydrolytic enzymatic activity is observed with the anaerobic cultures, a pretreatment step is often required for the hydrolysis of biomass, consequently enhance the hydrogen production efficiency. During the pretreatment process, trapped components were released through cell wall lysis and delignification of lignocellulosic biomass. Subsequently, pretreatment process can destroy the crystal structure of macromolecular substances and release their polymerization degree. Consequently, a higher proportion of readily fermentable substances are made accessible for microorganisms. Pretreatment methods can be divided into four categories: physical treatment, chemical treatment, biological treatment and a combination of different treatments. Table 3 shows the commonly used pretreatment methods and their applications in treating biomass."
6,Physical treatment,"3.1 Physical treatment Physical treatment methods have been studied for biomass pretreatment include mill, grind, ultrasonication, heat, freeze and thaw, microwave and ionizing radiation as illustrated in Table 3. 3.1.1 Mechanical treatment Mechanical treatment methods like milling, grinding and chipping are usually used as the first step to reduce the particle size, create higher accessible surface area and decrease crystallinity [12,13]. Mechanical treatment is usually combined with other physical treatment methods and chemical, biological treatment methods. Studies have figured out that mechanical treatment can efficiently enhance the treatment efficiency of the followed treatment methods [64]. Yeh et al. [65] observed that the enzymatic hydrolysis rate of cellulose was increased by more than 5-folds after a milling treatment. Mais et al. [66] achieved 100% hydrolysis of lignocellulosic substrate with a minimum enzyme loading by using simultaneous ball milling. 3.1.2 Ultrasonication Ultrasonication is also considered as a mechanical pretreatment method, but it owns both physical and chemical effects. During the ultrasonication process, shear forces, high localized temperature (5000 K) and pressure (180 MPa), and highly active radicals are generated in the medium, resulting in cell disruption and particle solubilization. Ultrasonication is more commonly used in solubilizing waste activated sludge. Studies have found that the sludge disintegration degree increased with the energy density and treating time of ultrasonication [67]. Kotay and Das [68] treated waste activated sludge by ultrasonication and enhanced COD solubilization by 5% and hydrogen yield by 60%. Guo et al. [69] improved COD solubilization of waste activated sludge by 87% using ultrasonication treatment. Nguyen et al. [70] achieved the enhanced hydrogen production by over 25% from sonicated algae biomass. 3.1.3 Heat treatment Heat treatment is the most widely used method in solubilizing biomass for fermentative hydrogen production. High temperature can disrupt the chemical bonds of the cell wall and membrane, leading to the solubilization of cell components and deterioration of microbial protein [71,72]. Besides its high efficiency in biomass disintegration, the wide application of heat treatment also owes to its simple operation and easy control. It is essential to choose an appropriate temperature in heat treatment. Low temperatures may lead to insufficient disintegration, while too high temperatures can result in the excessive degradation of organic matters in biomass, reduce the value of biomass as an organic source for fermentative hydrogen production [73]. Furthermore, too high treatment temperatures may also cause the formation of refractory compounds, which are inhibitory to fermentative hydrogen production [74]. Temperature adopted in disintegrating biomass varies a lot according to different substrates. For the waste activated sludge treated for biohydrogen production, treating temperature ranges from 100 °C to 175 °C and duration time from 15 min to 60 min. The most widely used condition is 121 °C for 20–30 min. For the algae biomass, treating temperature ranges from 65 °C to 180 °C and duration time from 15 min to 60 min. Similar with waste activated sludge, the most commonly used condition is 121 °C for 15–20 min. As to the Cellulose-based biomass, treating temperature ranges from 50 °C to 220 °C and duration time from 90 s to 90 min. Since heat treatment is usually combined with other treatment methods in treating cellulose-based biomass, the temperature adopted varies a lot according to the combined treatment methods. 3.1.4 Freezing and thawing Freezing and thawing is mainly applied in treating waste activated sludge. It involves freezing the sludge at extreme temperature and thawing at room temperature for several cycles. During these strong fluctuations in temperature, cell swelling is caused by intracellular ice crystals formation. Consequently, cell aggregates are damaged and disrupted [75]. Kotay and Das [68] observed 40% enhancement in hydrogen yield from freeze and thaw treated waste activated sludge. Wang et al. [21] achieved 1.5–2.5 times increase of hydrogen yield with freeze and thaw treatment. However, both Kotay and Wang et al. reported no enhancement in sludge solubilization after freeze and thaw treatment. Besides waste activated sludge, Chang et al. [76] firstly explored the effects of freeze and thaw treatment on rice straw, and a significant increase of enzyme digestibility from 48% to 84% was obtained. Indicating that freeze and thaw can be a good candidate when combined with enzyme treatment. 3.1.5 Microwave Microwave irradiation is a kind of electromagnetic radiation with frequencies range from 0.3 GHz to 300 GHz. Effects of microwave irradiation on microorganisms comprises thermal and non-thermal effect [77,78]. When microwave pass through a product, a chaotic movement of molecules happens. With the continuous rotating electric field, alignment and realignment of polar molecules (like water) occurs, leading to the heat generation, rupture of hydrogen bonds and modification of hydration zone [11,79–81]. The effectiveness of microwave irradiation in destructing cells is affected by the treating temperature and the electromagnetic field power. Xia et al. [82] treated algae biomass by microwave, the results showed that the reducing sugar yield was increased with the treating temperature. Kuglarz et al. [27] compared sludge treated by microwave of 700 W and 900 W at same temperature, better performance was obtained by 900 W. To figure out the non-thermal effect of microwave, Guo et al. [83] compared the effect of microwave and heat treatment on sludge disintegration at same temperature, solubilization of microwave treated sludge was more than 3 times over heat treated sludge. Thus, microwave is a quite potential treatment method in disintegrating biomass for fermentative hydrogen production. 3.1.6 Ionizing radiation Ionizing radiation comprises gamma irradiation and electron beam. The high energy irradiation can change physical or chemical properties of target substance through both direct action and indirect action. Direct action refers to the atoms in molecules absorb the energy, which is sufficient to remove the electrons from the atoms and result in bond breaks. Indirect action is mediated by free radicals. These highly active radicals are usually generated when water is irradiated by ionizing radiation, and they can react with substances present in the liquid phase in less than 1 us. Both direct and indirect effects can result in cell rupture and biomass solubilization. Ionizing radiation has been widely used in treating waste activated sludge for various purposes include sludge disinfection, hazardous materials elimination and sludge dewatering etc. [84–87]. Both Kim et al. [88] and Chu et al. [89] found that sludge solubilization increased with ionizing radiation dose lower than 50 kGy. Bak et al. [90] examined the effect of electron beam radiation on enzyme digestibility of rice straw, the results showed that glucose yield increased with the increase of electron beam from 0 kGy to 80 kGy but declined when the treating dose increased to 90 kGy. Yin and Wang [31,32] explored hydrogen production from gamma radiation treated waste activated sludge, and the highest hydrogen yield of 10.5 mL/g SCOD was achieved from sludge treated by alkali-irradiation at pH = 12 and 20 kGy. 3.1.7 Electric current Electric current was found to be able to destruct cell membranes and lead to microbial permeabilization [91,92]. It has been used in inactivating microbes but very few studies have applied it in treating feedstock. Jeong et al. [93] examined the feasibility of electric current (20–100 V) as a pretreatment method to enhance hydrogen production from Laminaria japonica. Hydrogen yield was increased by 72.6% at 58.5 V for 30 min, revealing that the electric current has a potential as an alternative method for feedstock preparation."
7,Chemical treatment,"3.2 Chemical treatment Chemical treatment methods have been studied for biomass treatment comprises acid and alkaline treatment, oxidizing agent addition and methanogenic inhibitors addition as illustrated in Table 3. 3.2.1 Acid and alkaline treatment Acid treatment is also a commonly used treatment method for feedstock preparation. It disrupts cells through changing the electric charge on the cell membrane [94]. HCl, H2SO4 as well as H3PO4 are applied. For waste activated sludge treatment, HCl is used for the treatment. The treating pH ranges from 3 to 4, and treating time ranges from 0 to 24 h. Assawamongkholsiri et al. [95] explored waste activated sludge treated by 0.5% (w/v) HCl for 0–24 h, and the maximum hydrogen production was obtained from the sludge treated for 6 h. As to algae biomass and cellulose-based biomass, acid treatment is usually combined with heat treatment. H2SO4 is more widely used and the concentrations range between 0.5% and 6% according to the followed heating temperature. Although it is believed that concentrated acid accompanied with lower temperature is more economic [12], diluted acid with higher temperature is more widely used for its better performance. Park et al. [96] studied hydrogen production from red algal biomass treated by combined acid and heat treatment, both H2SO4 concentration (0.5–1.5%) and heat temperature (120–180 °C) were examined. The results revealed that the hydrolysis temperature was the most significant factor, and the highest hydrogen production was obtained at 0.5% H2SO4 and 161–164 °C hydrolysis. Besides, 0.5% H2SO4 and 121 °C hydrolysis is the most commonly used its easier operation and relatively high efficiency [97–100]. Base treatment works through the dissolution and saponification of ester bonds, leading to cell membrane dissolution, polymerization decrease and cellulose crystallinity destruction. NaOH, NH4OH and Ca(OH)2 are used in base treatment. Waste activated sludge can be effectively solubilized at pH 10–12 for 24 h. Cai et al. [15] achieved 82.4% enhancement of hydrogen production from waste activated sludge through base treatment at pH 12 for 24 h. Both Carver et al. [101] and Lakaniemi et al. [102] enhanced hydrogen production from Chlorella vulgaris biomass through base treatment at pH 9.5. As to the cellulose-based feedstock, Ozkan et al. [63] compared base treatment, combined base-heat treatment and combined base-microwave treatment, best hydrogen production was obtained from the base treated beet-pulp. However, in most studies, base treatment is used in combination with heat or biological treatment [103–107]. Acid and base treatments are usually conducted at room temperature. Besides heat treatment, they are the most commonly used treatment methods for the convenient operation and high efficiency. Cheap and efficient acid or alkali can easily promote their application. However, both acid and base treatment requires long resident time when they are used alone. Furthermore, inhibitory compounds were also detected after the treatment process [108]. Another limiting factor is the pH adjustment required after the treatment process, which is neither economic nor environmentally friendly. The addition of chemical reagents creates more work for the subsequent processing. 3.2.2 Oxidizing agents For the ozonolysis process, ozone gas is used to solubilize biomass for its strong oxidizing property and high solubility. Unlike acid or base treatment, no inhibitory compounds are formed during the ozonolysis process and no residual chemical reagents are left after the ozonolysis process [13]. Treatment efficiency of ozonolysis process is affected by aeration rate of ozone, processing time and water content of feedstock. Yang et al. [67] examined sludge disintegration by ozone dose range 0.05–0.2 g O3/g dry solid and time duration 0–60 min, the highest sludge disintegration degree was obtained at 0.15 g O3/g dry solid for 60 min. Wu et al. [109,110] revealed that with the increasing ozone dose from 0 to 6.5 mg O3/g straw, and ozonation time from 0 to 150 min, lignin contents of the wheat straw and barley straw decreased gradually. However, inhibitory effect on hydrogen yield was observed when ozonolysis process was over 90 min. Ozonolysis has showed its potential application in treating biomass for its high efficiency. But considering the large amount of ozone required in large scale application, economical efficiency of this technology still need to be further discussed. H2O2 can generate nascent oxygen that breaks the glycosidic bonds, disintegrates complex carbohydrates to simple sugars. H2O2 treatment is not widely used in feedstock treatment. Roy et al. [44] explored hydrogen production from algae biomass treated by H2O2, and compared it with different treatment methods include autoclave, sonication and acid treatment. A better performance in hydrogen production was observed in H2O2 treatment test than autoclave and sonication tests. 3.2.3 Methanogenic inhibitors For the feedstock treatment, BESA and CHCl3 have been applied in suppressing the methanogenic bacteria while solubilizing organic matters [21,68]. Wang et al. [21] obtained treated waste activated sludge through adding 1 M BESA, and obtained significant SCOD/TCOD increase and methane yield inhibition. However, hydrogen yield was also suppressed compared with raw sludge. Wongthanate et al. [111] showed an inhibitory effect of 1 M BESA on hydrogen production from food waste and starch waste. Kotay and Das [68] revealed that both BESA (10 mM) and CHCl3 (1% v/v) had no effect on sludge solubilization, but hydrogen yield increased 1.5 times with BESA addition. However, for the tests added CHCl3, hydrogen yield was significantly suppressed. Based on the studies mentioned above, concentration of BESA can significantly affect the hydrogen production, and lower concentration (10 mM) shows better performance. More studies concerning the effects of CHCl3 on hydrogen production are needed."
8,Biological treatment,"3.3 Biological treatment Enzymatic treatment is commonly used in treating cellulose-based biomass and algae biomass, and it is usually conducted after physical or chemical treatment. Various enzymes have been used in enzymatic treatment (Table 3), cellulase is the most frequently used enzyme. The disintegration effect of enzymatic treatment is affected by enzyme species, substrate characteristics, enzyme dose and hydrolyzing duration. Srivastava et al. [112] applied cellulase in hydrolyzing rice straw for hydrogen production, 54.18 g/L sugars were obtained in the hydrolysate and hydrogen production of 2.58 L H2/L hydrolysate was obtained. Guo et al. [83] hydrolyzed waste activated sludge by adding multi-enzyme in the ratio of 1:50 (v:v), dissolved organic matters were significantly increased and achieved a better performance than microwave and heating. However, hydrogen yield from sludge hydrolyzed by enzyme showed no advantage than sludge hydrolyzed by physical treatments. Cheng et al. [113] explored the effect of cellulase and glucoamylase on sugar yields of algae biomass. The application of both enzymes showed significant advantage in sugar release than cellulose alone. Quéméneur et al. [114] compared the effect of different CEP enzyme concentrations on hydrogen production from wheat straw, and revealed a positive correlation between hydrogen yield and enzyme dose. Besides enzymatic treatment, bacterial hydrolysis is also applied in decomposing feedstock. The commonly known bacterial hydrolysis is the disruption of lignocellulosic biomass by fungal treatment. Among the fungi species include white-rot, brown-rot and soft-rot fungi, white-rot fungi Phanerochaete chrysosporium is the most widely used. Zhao et al. [115,116] enhanced enzymatic saccharification of corn stalk and hydrogen production. Besides the fungal degradation of biomass, other microbes were also used. Guo et al. [83] and Sittijunda et al. [117] explored sludge disintegration by aerobic thermophilic digestion, through controlling a proper digestion condition and duration, both studies achieved considerate enhancement in hydrogen production. Carver et al. [101] successfully increased hydrogen production from algae biomass by inoculating cellulose degrading strain TC60 to the system. Patel et al. [7] enhanced hydrogen production from mixed bio-wastes using defined sets of mixed cultures for hydrolysis. Biological treatment is usually conducted in mild conditions, low energy consuming and requires no subsequent processing. However, because of the low hydrolysis rate, most biological treatment methods are time consuming and hard to be commercialized."
9,Combined treatment,"3.4 Combined treatment To disintegrate biomass more efficiently and take advantage of various treatment methods, the combination of different methods is studied. Most combined treatment methods comprise a physical treatment method and a chemical treatment method. Combined heat and acid treatment is the most commonly used method. Assawamongkholsiri et al. [95] compared the activated sludge treated by acid, heat and combined acid and heat, the highest SCOD, protein and carbohydrate concentrations were all obtained from combined acid and heat treated sludge. Roy et al. [44] examined effect of different treatment methods on algae biomass disintegration and hydrogen production, best performance was observed with combined acid and heat treated microalgae. Combined acid and heat treatment is also frequently applied in disintegrating cellulose-based biomass include straw [118–120], stalk [99], bagasse [98,100,121,122] and grass [97,123] etc. Besides acid treatment, heat treatment has also been combined with other methods such as base treatment, enzymatic treatment and oxidizing agent addition. Kang et al. [124] applied combined base and heat treatment to disintegrate the sewage sludge, solubilization ratio of 85% was achieved, which was much higher than using heat or base treatment alone. Ozkan et al. [63] obtained significant solubilization of beet-pulp with combined base and heat treatment. Enzyme hydrolysis after heat treatment has been proved to be able to significantly enhance the hydrogen yield. Massanet-Nicolau et al. [125,126] and Yasin et al. [127] added cellulase hydrolysis after heat treatment to enhance the sludge solubilization. Li and Chen [128] and Prasad et al. [129] also achieved an increase in hydrogen production from straw by cellulase addition. Other combination of treatment methods are also Studied. Yang et al. [67] and Wu et al. [109] combined ozone with ultrasonication and enzyme hydrolysis, respectively. Cheng et al. [107] and Xia et al. [82] combined microwave with base and acid treatment, respectively. Yin and Wang [31,32] and Kim et al. [88] examined the combination of ionizing radiation and base treatment. Srivastava et al. [112] combined base and cellulose hydrolysis for treating rice straw for hydrogen production. All of them achieved enhanced hydrogen production from treated biomass wastes. In some cases, combinations of three or more treatment methods were used. Like acid-heat-enzyme treatment [130,131], acid-microwave-enzyme treatment [113], base-heat-enzyme treatment [104] and so on."
10,Comparison of different treatment methods,"3.5 Comparison of different treatment methods Different treatment methods have different effects on biomass disintegration. Fig. 3 shows the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of waste activated sludge treated by different physical treatment methods. Fig. 3 AB, CD and EF show the raw sludge and sludge treated by ultrasonication, microwave and ionizing radiation, respectively. It can be seen that all the treatment methods have an apparent effects on microbial cell disruption and sludge solubilization. Fig. 4 shows the effect of enzyme treatment on sludge before and after fermentation process. After the enzyme hydrolysis, a hole was observed in sludge structure (Fig. 4A). Sludge with enzyme treatment was degraded to smaller structures after fermentation (Fig. 4C) while sludge without enzyme treatment still showed complex structure after fermentation (Fig. 4D). Fig. 5 shows the SEM images of waste activated sludge after different combined treatments. It can be seen that ultrasonic-alkaline treated sludge had the smallest particle size (Fig. 5D), followed by thermo-alkaline (Fig. 5C). Neither thermo-acid nor thermo-alkaline was efficient in sludge disintegration, indicating that base and ultrasonication treatments are more efficient in destroying cell walls than acid and thermal treatments. Fig. 6 shows the optical microscope images of algae biomass treated by different treatment methods. Before the treatment process, intact algae cells were clearly displayed (Fig. 6A). Comparison of Fig. 6B and C showed that higher acid concentration brought out more cell solubilization. For the H2O2 treated algae, quite a few intact cells still can be seen (Fig. 6D), and physical treatment led to the lest cell debris (Fig. 6E, F). This result indicated that combined treatment had the strongest disintegration effect on cells, followed by chemical treatment. Physical treatment showed to be the least effective. Based on the different effects of treatment methods, their application also differs according to the feedstock species. Articles focused on dark fermentative hydrogen production from biomass in recent 10 years are reviewed, and accordingly, the distributions of different treatment methods on biomass are summarized in Fig. 7. For the treatment applied in all kinds of biomass, combined methods were mostly used, accounting for about 32% of all reports, followed by physical treatment with 30%. Chemical treatment was the least used method. However, when it comes to different kinds of biomass, treatment methods present different distributions. For the waste activated sludge and algae biomass, physical treatment was the most commonly used, accounts for 37% and 40%, respectively. The reason is that both waste activated sludge and algae biomass have high water content, physical treatment like heat, microwave and ultrasonication can be easily and efficiently conducted. Comparing with waste activated sludge, algae biomass and cellulose-based biomass are more refractory. Thus, the combined methods are more widely used with 33% and 44%, respectively. It can be seen that cellulose-based material without treatment also occupied a big part with 28%, which was mainly contributed by studies used chemicals like carboxymethyl cellulose to represent the natural cellulose material. It is difficult to conclude which treatment method is best. In some cases, the best disintegration does not mean the best hydrogen production. Severe treatment conditions have good dissolution performance, but they also cause the loss of organic matters and the formation of inhibitive substances [30]. Thus, the review of pretreatment only provides reference for selecting treatment method, but the specific treatment condition still need to be explored according to the certain circumstances."
11,Bottlenecks of pretreatment on hydrogen production,"3.6 Bottlenecks of pretreatment on hydrogen production Although the pretreatment can promote the hydrolysis of biomass, thus enhance the hydrogen production efficiency and substrate degradation rate. However, the negative effects accompanied with the pretreatment. The bottlenecks of hydrogen production from biomass mainly include three aspects. (1) The formation of inhibitors during the pretreatment process Studies have shown that a range of inhibitors may form along with the pretreatment. For example, furan-derivatives, carbonic acids and phenolic-compounds are usually formed during the pretreatment of lignocellulose biomass, influencing the microbial activity, microbial communities as well as the overall metabolic pathways [9]. Maillard reactions may happen when waste activated sludge is treated at high temperature, forming some refractory polymers, suppressing the nutrients recovery and hydrogen production [27,30]. The formation of inhibitors is closely related to the pretreatment conditions and composition of the feedstock. Eskicioglu et al. treated lignocellulose biomass at a range of 26–175 °C, and found that furans and phenolic compounds formed were below the inhibitory levels for hydrogen production [132]. Thus, more explorations are needed to figure out proper pretreatment conditions for different kinds of biomass. (2) Subsequent treatment. Based on the pretreatment methods applied, some subsequent treatment is required, especially when chemical treatment is used. For example, desalination is usually needed after the acid/base treatment. The methanogenic inhibitors like CHCl3 and BESA are all toxic chemicals that cannot be discharged directly. Besides, hazardous materials may also form during other treatment methods, which requires subsequent evaluation and treatment. (3) Energy and environmental benefits. Some treatment methods are high energy-consuming, like hydrothermal, microwave; some treatment methods may tax the environment, like the added chemicals and formed hazardous materials. Thus, lots of efforts are needed to evaluate the energy and environmental benefits of each treatment methods."
12,Hydrogen production from various biomass feedstock,"Fermentative hydrogen production is affected by many factors like substrate type and concentration, pretreatment methods, inoculum source, fermentation temperature, initial pH and so on. For hydrogen production from biomass wastes, variation of substrate composition requires different operational and bioprocessing conditions for efficient hydrogen production. Tables 4–8 summarizes fermentative hydrogen production from different biomass feedstock."
13,Waste activated sludge,"4.1 Waste activated sludge Hydrogen production through dark fermentation from waste activated sludge is summarized in Table 4. Treatment process is a critical step before hydrogen production from waste activated sludge, not only disintegrating sludge, but inhibiting non-hydrogen producers present in waste activated sludge. Thus, studies are classified and summarized according to the treatment methods applied. Total solid concentration of sludge varies significantly according to the different sources and retention time. Inoculum is not essential when waste activated sludge is used as substrate since it is pretty rich in microorganisms. However, in some studies, hydrogen producers like Clostridium sp. and Enterobacter sp. were inoculated into the fermentation system to enhance the hydrogen production efficiency [133]. Initial pH 5.0–11.0 was used, which is pretty diverse. It owed to the different pretreatment methods used. For the treatment with the addition of acid or alkali, acidic or alkaline conditions were adopted to save the cost for pH adjustment [15,95]. Both mesophilic (30–37 °C) and thermal (55–78 °C) conditions were studied, and mesophilic fermentation was more commonly used for the lower operational cost."
14,Algal biomass,"4.2 Algal biomass Table 5 shows the fermentative hydrogen production from various algal biomass. Since the composition of algal biomass varies significantly along with its species, studies are summarized and listed according to the algae species. It can be seen that microalgae is more used as substrate than macroalgae. This may because the microalgae biomass has simpler structure than macroalgae, thus, simpler pretreatments are required. Besides, microalgae can be cultivated in various conditions and more easily obtained. Furthermore, high salinity of macroalgae cultivated in marine ecosystem inhibited its application in fermentative hydrogen production. Among microalgae strains, Chlorella sp. was the most widely studied. Highest hydrogen yield of 958 mL H2/g VS was obtained from acid-heat treated Chlorella sorokiniana biomass [44]. Scenedesmus sp. was also extensively studied for its high carbohydrates content [36], highest hydrogen yield of 113.1 mL H2/g VS was achieved from heat treated Scenedesmus sp. [48]. As to the macroalgae, Laminaria japonica was the most commonly studied for its high carbohydrates content and low requirement of treatment [38]. Besides Laminaria japonica, other macroalgae species were only explored in a few studies, which was far from the application. As to the operational conditions, substrate concentration varied from 5 g TS/L to 117 g TS/L, commonly used inoculum was anaerobic sludge and Clostridium butyricum strains. Initial pH range between 6.0 and 8.0 Except for hydrogen production from Chlorella sp. explored thermal conditions (58–60 °C), most studies were conducted at mesophilic conditions (29–38 °C)."
15,Cellulose-based biomass,"4.3 Cellulose-based biomass Cellulose-based biomass has been widely used as feedstock for fermentative hydrogen production. To explore hydrogen production process, some studies used cellulose to simulate natural cellulose materials. Besides, cellulose-based biomass has also been extensively studied, including straws (rice straw, wheat straw, corn straw, sugarcane straw etc.), stalks (corn stalk, sunflower stalk etc.), corn stover and cob, bagasse, grass, leaves and so on. Table 6 demonstrates the hydrogen production from simulated cellulose materials. Cellulose concentration from 0.2 g/L to 10 g/L was studied. Since the bought cellulose is usually present in powder, besides the studies without treatment, commonly used treatment include enzyme treatment, bacterial hydrolysis and combined acid-heat treatment. Pure strains were more widely used as inoculum than mixed cultures like anaerobic sludge and compost. Thermophilic bacteria species were especially preferred among the pure strains. Accordingly, operational temperature range from 55 °C to 70 °C was used. For the studies conducted at mesophilic conditions, 37 °C was used. Besides the temperature, pH 5.5–8.0 was adopted. Hydrogen yield of 0.6–19 mmol H2/g cellulose was achieved, and higher yield was obtained from thermophilic fermentation systems. As to the natural cellulose-based biomass, various straws were most widely studied for hydrogen production. As shown in Table 7, 10–340 g TS /L straw was used as substrate after pretreatment. Mixed cultures like anaerobic and manure was preferred, since it is hard to maintain the system uninfected when real wastes are used as substrate. pH ranged from 4.1 to 8.0 and pH 6–7 was the most widely used. Temperature between 35 and 40 °C and 55–80 °C were studied, and 35 °C was the most commonly used. Hydrogen yield of 3.49–93.4 mL H2/g TS was achieved, and hydrogen yield obtained from treated straw was significantly higher than untreated tests. Besides straws, many other cellulose-based biomass was also studied. As shown in Table 8, most of the biomass was from agricultural wastes, like corn wastes (corn stalk, corn stover, corn cob and corn silage), tree wastes (poplar leaves and pine tree wood), grass, bagasse and so on. Substrate concentration of 10–340 g TS /L was used. Similar with hydrogen production from straws, anaerobic sludge was the most commonly used inoculum. For the studies conducted at thermal conditions, thermophilic bacteria strains other than mixed bacteria were more used as inoculum. This was because the risk of infection was reduced significantly at thermal conditions, thus, pure strains were preferred to achieve a higher hydrogen yield [103,115,134,135]. pH ranged from 4.0 to 7.5 while pH 6–7 was the most commonly used. Mesophilic reactions were conducted at 28–38 °C, and 35 °C was the most widely used. Thermal fermentations were performed at 50–80 °C, and 60 °C was the most widely used."
16,Perspectives and future research directions,"Hydrogen production from fossil fuel is presently dominant for its applicable technologies and high efficiency. However, the pollutant formation and energy consumption dramatically decreased the environmental benefits of hydrogen production. Thus, development of sustainable hydrogen production processes is necessary. Dark fermentative hydrogen production from biomass wastes achieves dual benefits of hydrogen generation and wastes treatment, maps a promising future for hydrogen society. In this regard, application of biomass wastes in fermentative hydrogen production was reviewed, three categories of biomass were considered in this review, including waste activated sludge, algae biomass and cellulose-based biomass (mainly include agricultural and municipal wastes). Cellulose-based biomass is the most widely studied for its abundant sources, followed by waste activated sludge. Algae biomass attracts attention recently for its CO2 fixation and easy cultivation. Reports by over 200 papers have indicated the feasibility of dark fermentative hydrogen production from biomass. However, it appears that the technology is still in its infancy, the low hydrogen yield and substrate degradation rate hindered the extensive application of bio-hydrogen production from biomass. Thus, further studies in quite a few areas are needed to assess the implementation potential of fermentative hydrogen production process. 1) For the hydrogen production from actual biomass wastes, mixed cultures have been more commonly used as inoculum. Various sources of mixed cultures may lead to the variation of hydrogen production performance, especially for the systems using complex substrate. A few studies have tried to enhance hydrogen yield through adding functional microbes into the system, like robust hydrogen producers, cellulose-decomposing microorganisms, lignocellulolytic microorganisms and so on. Nevertheless, maintaining the desired microbial cultures through controlling fermentation conditions deserve further investigations. 2) Pretreatment is a critical process for fermentative hydrogen production from biomass. It can not only affect the biodegradability of biomass, but the composition of organic matters in feedstock. Studies have shown that heat treatment was the most widely used, and the combinations of different treatment methods were increasingly explored. Different treatment methods were preferred by different kinds of biomass, and cellulose-based biomass usually requires more severe treatment. Considering the possible negative effects of pretreatment on hydrogen production, more explorations are required to make the process more efficient, and offer the guide for choosing a proper treatment according to biomass characteristics, environmental and economic efficiency. 3) Besides the microbes and substrate, the biological processes are highly dependent on the fermentation conditions, like temperature, pH, composition of inorganic matters, partial pressure of hydrogen, etc. These operational parameters affect not only hydrogen yield, but also the by-product formation. 4) During the fermentation process, a wide range of intermediates and by-products are formed besides the target product H2. Energy conversion ratio to hydrogen is usually lower than 40%, the other 60% is mainly turned into volatile fatty acids formation and microbial growth. To recover the energy remained in liquid phase and minimize the wastes, downstream processes are recommended. A few studies have been conducted to convert the residual volatile fatty acids and alcohols to bioenergy, like photo fermentative hydrogen production, methanogenic fermentation, electricity generation through microbial fuel cells and value-added chemicals production through chain elongation. However, all above processes are still in their infancy stage and need to be further explored. 5) Up to date, hydrogen production in batch mode has been extensively studied, while the studies on fermentation in continuous mode are far from enough. The literature review shows that full-scale plants in operation are scare. Obstacles of the shift from lab-scale fermentative hydrogen production to industrial scale mainly lie in the complicated reactor design as well as operation. Since the composition of biomass is complex, and a large proportion of organic matters are in solid form, leading to the difficulties in achieving both high hydrogen production and good biomass retention. Thus, both the design and operation of high-rate reactors deserve further studies. For such reasons, to achieve a full-scale application of fermentative hydrogen production from biomass-based materials, considerable efforts are still needed from both technical and managing aspects."
17,Conclusions,"The present review gives an insight on recent developments of fermentative hydrogen production from biomass-based materials. The influencing factors, such as the characteristics of biomass, the pretreatment of biomass and the operation of dark fermentation are discussed. It can be concluded that pretreatment of biomass can be effective in enhancing the fermentative hydrogen production, but the treating conditions need to be specifically examined according to the different characteristics of biomass. Combining various pretreatment methods may be more efficient and less energy-consuming. The operation of fermentation process can also have significant effects on hydrogen production, like the inoculum, temperature, pH and biomass concentration. Batch-mode fermentations have been widely studied, but continuous mode operations are scare. The continuous process will be the key emphasis of study in the future. Furthermore, downstream processes are require to be studied to recover the energy remained in terminal liquid products and achieve a higher energy conversation efficiency."
