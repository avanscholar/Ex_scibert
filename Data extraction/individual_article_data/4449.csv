0,Introduction,"Air transportation is one of the fastest-growing traffic modes, so that energy and environmental problems caused by fossil jet fuel are becoming increasingly serious. The production of jet fuel from biomass can significantly reduce the consumption of fossil energy and alleviate the greenhouse effect [1,2]. Therefore, the search for sustainable alternative aviation fuels from biomass has been one of global concerns. At present, there are many conversion technologies of bio-jet fuel from various biomass materials. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has approved some technic pathways to produce bio-jet fuels [3–5], including biomass gasification Fischer - Tropsch (FT) synthesis [6], hydroprocessed ester and fatty acids synthesis derived from oil & fat [7], direct sugars to hydrocarbon via fermentation derived from sugar-rich feedstock and alcohol. Other pathways are still under the research and development stages, such as catalytic hydro-thermolysis [8], and hydrothermal liquefaction [9] of cellulosic biomass. The aqueous conversion can produce bio-jet fuel by the hydrolysis of the cellulose and hemicellulose components in lignocellulosic biomass, such as agricultural and forestry residues, etc. Compared with the first-generation biofuel technology, the aqueous conversion technology utilizes more sorts of biomass, which is not limited to oil crops or waste fats [7]. Moreover, the biomass conversion are operated under moderate condition avoiding the high gasification and reforming in this technology by contrast to FT synthesis [6]. Therefore, various technical routes of lignocellulosic biomass aqueous conversion were actively explored to produce jet fuels [10–12]. This bio-jet fuel production process is quite complicated involving hydrothermal decomposition and catalytic hydrotreatment. Some researchers carried out the process simulations and optimizations using Aspen Plus to improve the energy efficiency of conversion and yield of bio-jet fuel [13,14]. For the development and research of a novel technology, the technical and economic analyses are often in focus. Some researchers studied the energy costs of bio-jet fuel combining energy consumption and economic cost to achieve energy management [15,16]. Moreover, several literature [13,17] studied both technical and economic aspects of bio-jet fuel production via aqueous conversion. Due to the nature of lignin, it is difficult to convert lignin to the hydrocarbons in the range of jet-fuel via aqueous conversion. Whereupon, as partial supplementary fuel, lignin is generally burned to supply heat for hydrothermal reactions [13,14,17]. Besides combustion, the lignin and the hydrolysis residual can be sufficiently converted via gasification with appropriate temperature [17]. As a certain amount of H2 is always needed by the hydrogenation & upgrading, one can utilize lignin to generate H2 via steam gasification. Correspondingly, more biomass is required and combusted to satisfy the heat demanded by the aqueous conversion. For the point views of thermodynamics and life cycle assessment, this change might be a more efficient way since biomass is the primary fuel while lignin can be used to generate the H2 production on the spot involves renewable feedstock and less fossil fuel consumption. Based on this, we proposed an alternative way to use the lignin to produce hydrogen via steam gasification aiming to improve the utilization efficiency of bio-jet fuel production from lignocellulosic biomass via aqueous conversion. On the other hand, the previous studies on thermodynamic performances of bio-jet fuel via aqueous conversion were mainly based on the first law of thermodynamic, which cannot reflect the changes of energy quality during the conversion process. As the exergy analysis, based on the second law of thermodynamics, can not only assessment the energy efficiency of the process but also determine the energy quality, many researchers carried out the exergy analyses of biomass conversion to produce the different productions. In these studies, the energy and exergy analyses of generating electricity from municipal solid-waste using various technical routines were widely carried out, including a combined heat and power generation from municipal solid-waste [18], a co-firing power plant with coal and agriculture residuals [19,20], and several novel configurations of combined cycle power generation from biomass [21,22]. In addition, the exergy analyses were used to evaluate various processes for producing biofuels, such as hydrogen [23,24], methane [24], ethanol [25,26], diesel [26], and aviation fuels [27]. So far, a few researchers conducted the exergy analysis of bio-jet fuel production from biomass FT synthesis [28,29]. Besides, the energy-exergy analyses were also conducted to evaluate the food production and optimize the energy and exergy efficiencies [30,31]. Therefore, the method of exergy analysis is helpful to improve energy and exergy efficiency of a complicated system. As above-mentioned, this modified process will subsequently cause a series of changes in energy and resource consumptions. In recent years, the evaluation method of exergy analysis combined with life cycle assessment (LCA) has been widely used to study the resource consumption of biomass conversion process. The cumulative exergy consumption (CExC) was first proposed as a performance index to optimize the process by Szargut et al. [32]. This method investigates the entire resource consumption, including energy resources and non-energy resources, from raw material extraction to product acquisition in the whole life cycle [33]. The concept of CExC also has been applied to bio-liquid fuels [34], such as rapeseed methyl ester (RME), soybean methyl ester (SME) and corn-based ethanol (EtOH). Recently, some researchers combined Cumulative Exergy Demand (CExD) with life cycle environmental assessment indicators as a product sustainability evaluation index [35]. Sorunmu et al. [36] combined CExD with environmental indicators and economic costs to evaluate the horse manure conversion to jet fuel and phenolic chemicals. Stougie et al. [37] proposed the Total Cumulative Exergy Loss method (TCEL) and evaluated the exergetic and environmental sustainability of different power generation systems via biomass combustion. Yang et al. [38] applied the Ecological Cumulative Exergy Consumption (ECEC) to evaluate and compare the performance of Biomass-to-Liquid (BTL) and Coal-to-Liquid (CTL) synfuels, which was based on the Emergy theory and LCA. Li et al. [39] proposed an improved CExC method, which integrated the resource consumption with environmental impact, and applied it to evaluating hydrogen production from biomass and natural gas. It can be seen that the method CExC or CExD is helpful to study the total resource consumption in the whole life cycle of the product. Therefore, based on the process simulation, this paper further studied the life cycle resource consumption of bio-jet fuel via aqueous conversion using CExC method, which can take both energy resource and non-energy resource consumed into account. On the basis of the above analyses, the goal of this study is to evaluate and optimize the conversion efficiencies and resource consumptions for seeking more appropriate processes for aqueous conversion bio-jet fuel. So, we proposed and established the aqueous conversion process by utilizing a part of lignin to generate H2 for hydrogenation & upgrading. The common aqueous conversion process with the combustion of all lignin as fuel was also studied as the reference case. Then, the process simulations of the two cases, i.e. the lignin used to produce hydrogen and to burn supplied for heat, were carried out based on Aspen Plus. And the comparative studies of biomass conversion energy efficiency and exergy efficiency between the two cases are explored during the conversion process. Furthermore, the cumulative exergy analysis was applied to assess the complete resource consumptions in the life cycle perspective."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Process description,"2.1 Process description Based on the technical route of bio-jet fuel production from biomass aqueous phase conversion proposed by Li [14,33], two process configurations of lignin utilization are studied to achieve complete use of biomass in this study. The detailed schemes of the two bio-jet fuel synthesis processes via biomass aqueous phase deconstruction and catalytic conversion process are shown as Fig. 1 . The process of bio-jet fuel production from lignocellulosic biomass via aqueous conversion includes the main units as follows: (1) hydrolysis of biomass to furfural production; (2) furfural concentration, (3) hydrolysis of steam stripped residue (SSR) to levulinic acid production (LA); (4) aldol condensation to oxygenated precursors, (5) hydrogenation and upgrading to bio-jet fuel hydrocarbon (C8–C15), as well as (6) combustion for steam and heat supply. Firstly, biomass is impregnated with 8.0 wt% sulfuric acid solution (biomass to acid solution ratio of 2.5), and furfural derived from hemicellulose decomposition is stripped by steam (steam to furfural ratio of 30). Then the dilute furfural stream is condensed by cooling water, and the concentrated furfural is obtained by distillation. The cellulose contained in SSR is further hydrolyzed to produce LA by 0.24 M H2SO4 solution (liquid to solid ratio of 9), while the insoluble lignin residue is separated by filtration. After two-step hydrolysis of biomass, the long carbon-chain oxygenates are formed by the concentrated platform chemicals furfural and LA through the aldol condensation reaction using a basic catalyst. Next, the insoluble oxygenated intermediates are separated from the liquid phase products by dilute sulfuric acid, and then are dissolved with organic solvent methanol (methanol to solid oxygenates ratio of 2). After that, the oxygenate intermediates are converted to jet fuel-range hydrocarbons (C8–C15) by the consecutive hydro-processing steps: low-temperature hydrogenation, high-temperature hydrodeoxygenation and upgrading. To achieve complete use of biomass, two means of the lignin residue utilization are studied in this study. Case 1 is the combustion of lignin for steam used by hydrolysis and heat supply as shown in Fig. 1(a), and Case 2 is the gasification of lignin for hydrogen production as shown in Fig. 1(b). The configuration of the lignin gasification adopted is based on the study by Li [23]."
3,Process simulation,"2.2 Process simulation Corn stalk (CS) as the feedstock is fed into the system at ambient conditions of 25 °C and 1 atm in this study. The component contents of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and extracts in corn stalk are shown in Table 1 . And the proximate and ultimate analyses of corn stalk and its components are listed in Table 2 . The two processes of aqueous conversion to produce bio-jet fuel are simulated to obtain mass flow, energy flow and exergy flow using Aspen Plus software. The key assumptions for the process simulations are summarized as follows. • The reactors are operated under a steady state, and residence time is long enough for the reactions to reach chemical equilibrium. • The particle sizes of feedstock are assumed as uniform without considering the difference. • The reactor temperature and pressure are considered to be uniform, and the pressure loss of the system is ignored. • Ash in biomass does not participate in any chemical reactions. • The carbon conversion efficiencies of the combustion of both biomass and lignin are set as 99%. • The carbon conversion efficiency of the lignin is 98% in the gasification stage. • The methanol recovery is considered as 90%. • The purity of hydrogen after purification is set as 100%. • The separation of liquid and solid via filtration is regarded as 100%. The system mainly consists of hydrolysis reactors, aldol condensation reactor, neutralization reactor, low-temperature hydrogenation and high-temperature hydrodeoxygenation unit, gasifier, combustor, and auxiliaries including separator, heat exchanger, fan and pump. The adopted model blocks in Aspen Plus to simulate reaction processes are shown in Table 3 . The operation parameters are taken from the related literature [11,40], which are also presented in Table 3. The yield models were simulated based on the data of literature [13], which is regarded as a basic parameter in this study. These main parameters are listed as follows: • The hemicellulose hydrolysis is set as 85% and furfural yield is 50% based on the hemicellulose content in CS. • The cellulose hydrolysis is 80% and LA yield is 29% based on the cellulose content in CS. • LA conversion efficiency is considered as 90% in aldol condensation. • The carbon conversion efficiency of oxygenated precursor to jet fuel ranged hydrocarbon is 84%."
4,Evaluation method,"2.3 Evaluation method Based on the mass and energy balances obtained from Aspen Plus simulations, this study carried out the exergy analysis of aqueous conversion process to bio-jet fuel from CS. The exergy analysis was conducted based on Szargut's exergy model [41], and the specific chemical exergy of the biomass feedstock and three components of CS are calculated by Song et al.’s correlation [42]. The temperature and pressure of reference environment are 25 °C and 1 atm, respectively. Moreover, the quantification of resource consumption based on cumulative exergy consumption (CExC) is investigated, which combines the ideas of exergy analysis and life cycle assessment (LCA) [39]. CExC refers to the sum of exergy consumptions of resources during the whole life cycle of the product from the raw materials collection, transportation, and acquisition of products or energy. In this study, the production of 1 ton of bio-jet fuel is taken as the functional unit (FU). Therefore, the total cumulative exergy consumption (CExC t ) in the life cycle of bio-jet fuel can be calculated as below: (1) C E x C t = ∑ j ∑ R k C E x C R R k , j + ∑ j ∑ N k C E x C N N k , j (2) C E x C R R k = C E x C e R k ⋅ W R R k (3) C E x C N N k = C E x C e N k ⋅ W N N k where C E x C R R k , j and C E x C N N k , j are the cumulative exergy consumption of renewable and non-renewable resources, respectively, in MJ/FU; W R and W N are the amount of renewable and non-renewable resource consumptions, respectively, in kg/FU; C E x C e is the specific cumulative exergy consumption, the subscripts Rk, Nk and j denote different renewable resource types, non-renewable resource types and life-cycle stages, respectively. The total exergy benefit ( E x p ) of the biomass to jet fuel process includes exergy from bio-jet fuel product and by-product steam, and the calculation equation is as follows: (4) E x p = e x J e t + e x s t ⋅ P s t where e x J e t and e x s t are the specific exergy of bio-jet fuel and by-product steam, respectively, in MJ/t; P s t is the yield of by-product steam per FU, in t/FU. The main evaluation indicators are considered as follows. 2.3.1 Evaluation indicators for bio-jet fuel production stage (1) Energy efficiency of bio-jet fuel ( η e n , J e t ) The energy efficiency of bio-jet fuel is used to measure the conversion degree of input energy of the production system into the target product jet fuel, as shown in Eq. (5). (5) η e n , J e t = E n J e t E n i n p u t × 100 % where E n J e t is the lower heat value (LHV) of bio-jet fuel, in MJ/FU; E n i n p u t is the total input energy of the production system, in MJ/FU, including the energy inputs of biomass, hydrogen and electricity in the production stage. (2) Energy efficiency of system ( η e n , s ) The energy efficiency of system ( η e n , s ) is defined as the ratio of total energy outputs of the products to the total energy inputs, as written in Eq. (6). (6) η e n , s = E n p E n i n p u t × 100 % where E n p is the total energy of bio-jet fuel and by-product steam, in MJ/FU. (3) Exergy efficiency of bio-jet fuel ( η e x , J e t ) The exergy efficiency of bio-jet fuel ( η e x , J e t ) is used to measure the ratio of the exergy output of bio-jet fuel product to the total exergy inputs in the production stage ( E x i n p u t , in MJ / FU ), which is written as Eq. (7). (7) η e x , J e t = e x J e t E x i n p u t × 100 % (4) Exergy efficiency of system ( η e x , s ) The exergy efficiency of system ( η e x , s ) is defined as the ratio of total useful exergy outputs to the total exergy inputs, as written in Eq. (8): (8) η e x , s = E x p E x i n p u t × 100 % (5) Internal exergy loss rate ( ξ i ) The internal exergy loss rate ( ξ i ) is defined as the proportion of internal exergy loss to the total exergy loss of unit or subsystem i, which is expressed as below: (9) ξ i = I i , i n t I i × 100 % where I i , i n t is the internal exergy loss of unit i, in MJ/FU, and I i is the sum of external exergy loss and internal exergy loss of unit or subsystem i, in MJ/FU. 2.3.2 Evaluation indicators of bio-jet fuel in life cycle (1) Cumulative exergy efficiency of bio-jet fuel ( ψ C E x C , J e t ) The cumulative exergy efficiency of bio-jet fuel ( ψ C E x C , J e t ) is used to reflect the exergy benefit of the bio-jet fuel product from all resources in the whole life cycle, which is expressed as follow: (10) ψ C E x C , J e t = e x J e t C E x C t × 100 % (2) Resource utilization efficiency ( ψ C E x C , s ) The resource utilization efficiency ( ψ C E x c , s ) is defined to explain the conversion and utilization degree of resources throughout the life cycle, which is expressed as the ratio of the exergy benefit from all products to the cumulative exergy consumption of renewable and non-renewable resources, as shown in Eq. (11). (11) ψ C E x C , s = E x p C E x C t × 100 % (3) Renewability ( I r ) The renewability I r is represented to explain the relation of the exergy benefit of all products and the cumulative exergy consumption of non-renewable resources throughout the life cycle. Thus, I r is defined as the ratio of E x p to the total cumulative exergy consumption of non-renewable resources, as shown in Eq. (12). (12) I r = E x p ∑ j ∑ k C E x C N N k , j From the point of life cycle view, the renewability degree of system can be evaluated by I r . When I r > 1 , the E x p is greater than the total cumulative exergy consumption of non-renewable resources, which means the product can obtain profit based on renewable resources, thus it can be regarded as a renewable system. Otherwise, the product is not renewable."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Thermodynamic analysis of bio-jet fuel production,"3.1 Thermodynamic analysis of bio-jet fuel production 3.1.1 Energy and exergy analyses of bio-jet fuel production The simulation result shows that the bio-jet fuel yield from hemicellulose and cellulose conversion is 103 kg/t-CS (dry basis), which is slightly higher than the bio-jet fuel yield of 93–100 kg/t-CS (dry basis) reported in the previous study [11]. The reason is that the yield of oxygenated precursors to jet fuel in the simulation (60.7%) is greater than in the literature (50%). Therefore, the result is considered reasonable. Based on the basic parameters, the energy flows and exergy flows of Case 1 and Case 2 are shown in Supplementary Table A1 and Table A2, respectively. Besides, the distributions of energy and exergy flows are indicated in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 , respectively. Under the basic parameters, the energy efficiencies ( η e n , J e t ) of Case 1 and Case 2 can reach 17.4% and 16.8%, respectively, while the exergy efficiencies ( η e x , J e t ) are 15.4% and 14.8%, respectively. It indicates that the thermodynamic performance of Case 1 is better than that of Case 2 due to the energy and exergy losses of hydrogen production from lignin gasification in Case 2. From the energy flow distributions as shown in in Figs. 2(a) and Fig.3(a), respectively, the largest energy losses of Case 1 and Case 2 occur in the furfural production unit, accounting for 38.8% and 37.5%, respectively, which result from the heat loss of steam-stripping and concentration process for furfural. The next largest loss of energy comes from the LA production unit, which accounts for 22.7% of Case 1 and 22.0% of Case 2, respectively, because two-step hydrolysis generates a certain amount of useless byproducts. Moreover, the energy losses resulted from the combustion & heat exchange unit for steam generation in Case 1 and Case 2 are 10.3% and 9.8%, respectively. By contrast with energy losses, Figs. 2(b) and Fig. 3(b) show that the largest exergy losses of Case 1 and Case 2 occur in the combustion & heat exchange unit accounting for 34.2% and 32.1%, respectively, in which the internal exergy loss rates occupy more than 90% ( ξ c a s e 1 = 90.7 % and ξ c a s e 2 = 90.8%). This result is similar to the distribution of the exergy damage in a solid fuel-fired power system. The largest exergy damage occurs in the boiler component because the fuel combustion reaction and the heat transfer causes great irreversibility [20]. Additionally, the exergy losses of Case 1 and Case 2 resulted from the furfural production unit account for 20.8% and 20.0%, respectively, and those caused by LA production unit account for 19.0% and 18.3%, respectively. Among them, the values of ξ in the furfural production unit and LA production unit are approximately 29.9% and 21.6%, respectively, indicating that a large part of exergy losses ascribes to the external exergy losses. Thus, both furfural and LA production units have the potential of energy recovery. Moreover, the comparisons between the energy and exergy analyses of the two cases show that the furfural production unit mainly causes the low-quality energy loss since the energy loss rate (about 38%) is larger than the exergy loss rate (about 20%). On the other hand, the proportion of the exergy loss in the combustion & heat exchange unit (about 32%) are much higher than that of the energy loss (10%), indicating an obvious destruction of energy quality. 3.1.2 Effect of waste heat and wastewater recovery In order to improve the thermodynamic performance of bio-jet fuel production, the waste heat of steam-stripping furfural is recovered to generate the saturated steam of 0.5 MPa (WHRS 1), which supplies heat for concentrating furfural solution, and the redundant steam is taken as a useful byproduct. On the other hand, the wastewater produced in the LA unit is firstly utilized to generate the saturated steam of 0.5 MPa (WHRS 2) by heat exchange to recover heat, and then to produce marsh gas by anaerobic fermentation of the soluble organics in wastewater for combustion. The bio-jet fuel production process with waste heat and wastewater recovery is shown in Fig. 4 . Taking the recovery of waste heat and the utilization of the soluble organics from LA unit into account, η e n , J e t , η e x , J e t , η e n , s and η e x , s of Case 1 achieve 22.3%,19.5%, 41.5% and 24.3% respectively, as shown in Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table A3. It can be seen that the values of η e n , J e t and η e n , s increase by 28.1% and 139.1%, respectively, compared to those under the basic parameters. Moreover, the values of η e x , J e t and η e x , s increases by 26.2% and 57.2%, respectively. Compared to Case 1, Case 2 has similar trends, but its thermodynamic performance is still slightly smaller. As shown in Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table A4, η e n , J e t , η e x , J e t , η e n , s and η e x , s of Case 2 are 21.3%, 18.6%, 39.8% and 23.1%, respectively. The values of η e n , J e t and η e n , s increase by 27.0% and 137.0%, respectively, and η e x , J e t and η e x , s increase by 25.0% and 55.7%, respectively, compared with those under the basic parameters. This indicates that the waste heat recovery is beneficial for enhancing the thermodynamic performance of bio-jet fuel production. However, the improvement of η e x , s is observably lower than that of η e n , s , which implies that the utilization of waste heat and wastewater mainly brings out the low-quality energy steam."
7,Cumulative exergy analysis of bio-jet fuel in life cycle,"3.2 Cumulative exergy analysis of bio-jet fuel in life cycle 3.2.1 Boundary and inventory data On the basis of the above energy and exergy analyses of biomass conversion process for bio-jet fuel, this study also carries out the cumulative exergy analysis of bio-jet fuel to investigate the resource consumptions in the life cycle. The life cycle of bio-jet fuel includes three stages: raw material acquisition, collection and transportation, and bio-jet fuel production, which is as shown in Fig. 7 . The resource consumption in the life cycle includes energy resources of biomass, electricity, water, diesel and hydrogen (only consumed in Case 1). Besides, the non-energy resource chemicals are considered, including sulfuric acid, lime, sodium hydroxide, and methanol, which were barely taken into account in the previous studies. The resource consumption of the cultivation stage of CS is collected based on the median value of resource inputs from literature in China, including fertilizers, farm chemicals (pesticide, herbicide), fuel, and electricity consumed for sowing, weeding, irrigation, fertilization, and harvesting. The weighting coefficient for the allocation of resource consumptions between corn grain and straw is calculated according to the monetary values [6].The weighting coefficient of corn stalk is 0.164 based on the average market prices of corn grain, corn stalk and corn cob, which are ¥2100, ¥450, and ¥450 per ton, respectively [43]. The resource consumed in the bio-jet fuel production stage is based on the simulation in this study. The biomass collection radius is assumed to set as 15 km based on the biomass collection model [44] and the scale of bio-jet fuel production (1000 ton bio-jet fuel/a). The data related to raw materials consumed in the system, such as chemicals, diesel, electricity, are mainly obtained from the Ebalance Database of China (Chinese Life Cycle Database (CLCD)) [45]. The inventory data of resource consumptions of Case 1 and Case 2 throughout the life cycle are shown in Supplementary Table A5 and Table A6. 3.2.2 Cumulative resource consumption The specific cumulative exergy consumptions (CExCe) of CS is based on its chemical exergy, as the additional resource consumptions from the stages of CS acquisition, collection and transportation have been considered in the life cycle of bio-jet fuel. The CExCe values of electricity, sodium hydroxide, sulfuric acid, and methanol are calculated based on CLCD. The CExCe values of the other resource involved in this study are taken from the literature [39,46–48]. Moreover, the cumulative exergy consumption of electricity is considered from non-renewable energy and renewable energy, which account for 96.06% and 3.94%, respectively, according to the resource data of CLCD. Except for biomass and part of electricity, the other input resources are regarded as non-renewable resources in this study. The CExCe values of resource input are shown in Table 4 . 3.2.3 Exergy analysis of life cycle For both systems, the CExCt and the indicators of integrated performance are summarized in Table 5 . It can be seen that the CExCt of Case 1 and Case 2 are 305.5GJ/FU and 317.6GJ/FU with the same beneficial exergy (58.75GJ/FU), respectively, indicating that Case 1 is 3.96% lower than that of Case 2. Consequently, both ψ C E x C , J e t and ψ C E x C , s of Case 1 are approximately 0.6 and 0.7% points higher than those of Case 2, respectively. This means that the hydrogen input externally via conventional production has better performance than that from lignin via steam gasification in the system. The result is consistent with the study of biomass fast pyrolysis to transportation fuels by Wright et al. [49]. The reason is that the market hydrogen made from natural gas has a higher energy efficiency than that produced from lignin and biomass gasification within the system. However, the I r of Case 2 is greater than that of Case 1, which indicates that the renewability of Case 2 is preferable. The I r values of both cases are less than 1 because the yield of bio-jet fuel from biomass via aqueous conversion is small. Due to the uncertainty of data acquisition in LCA, the data quality and the result reliability tend to be declined. In this study, the uncertainty analyses of the life cycle evaluation results are carried out based on the uncertainty analysis method used in the literature [30] and the study of our research group [50]. The calculation formula of the uncertainty used is shown as follow. (13) U R = ( ∂ R ∂ x 1 ) 2 ⋅ U 1 2 + ( ∂ R ∂ x 2 ) 2 ⋅ U 2 2 + ( ∂ R ∂ x 3 ) 2 ⋅ U 3 2 + ⋯ ( ∂ R ∂ x n ) 2 ⋅ U n 2 Where the U R is the uncertainty in the result and U1; U2; …; Un are the uncertainties in the independent variables. The result R is a given function of the independent variables x 1 ; x 2 ; …; x n . In this paper, the independent variables are the cumulative exergy consumptions of various resources input to the system, including corn stalk, electricity, sodium hydroxide, sulfuric acid, and methanol used in production, the diesel consumed for transportation, and the fertilizer and farm chemicals consumed for the biomass cultivation. Based on data quality assessment method of LCA [50,51], the errors of the independent variables input are summarized as follows. The errors of resource input from the process simulations are set as ± 10%. The errors of data from CLCD are considered as ± 10%. The errors of data from the literature are considered as ± 25%. Therefore, the uncertainties of ψ C E x C , J e t and ψ C E x C , s are calculated to be respectively ± 3.54% and ± 3.68% for Case 1, and be respectively ± 3.84% and ± 3.97% for Case 2. In order to investigate the main influence factor of the cumulative consumption and the renewability of bio-jet fuel, Fig. 8 presents the distributions of different resources. Corn stalks, which grow up by solar energy, account for the largest shares (66.2% and 73.1%) of the life-cycle resource consumptions for both Case 1 and Case 2, respectively. Except for hydrogen consumption, the second largest amount is the resource consumption of chemicals used for CS hydrolysis and neutralization (9.18% and 8.84%, respectively), and the followed item is the methanol used as the organic solvent (7.4% and 7.12%, respectively). It implies that the influence of both the acid and based chemicals and the methanol consumed on the non-renewable resource utilization should be concerned in aqueous conversion for bio-jet fuel. Moreover, the electricity consumed also occupies more than 5% for both systems. For Case 1, the cumulative exergy consumption of the input hydrogen accounts for 9.51%, which is the main reason for lower renewability of Case 1 compared with Case 2. Therefore, both cumulative exergy efficiency and renewability of bio-jet fuel production can be significantly enhanced by decreasing the chemicals consumption (especially for H2SO4 and CaO) and increasing the recovery rate of methanol during the aqueous conversion process. 3.2.4 Sensitivity analysis In this section, the sensitivity analysis of the influence factors are carried out to explore the efficient way to improve the cumulative exergy efficiency and renewability of the system. The factors are as follows: the ratio of steam to furfural for steam-stripping (S1), the yield of LA from cellulose (S2), the conversion efficiency of LA to the oxygenated precursor (S3), and the conversion efficiency of the oxygenates to bio-jet fuel (S4) and the recovery rate of methanol (S5). The sensitivity factor ( ε ) is calculated as below: (14) ε k , S i = | E k , S i − E 0 k , S i | E 0 k , S i / ( | C k , S i − C 0 k , S i | C 0 k , S i ) where C and E are the influence and response indicators under an analyzed parameter, respectively;C0 and E0 are the influence and response indicators under the basic parameters, respectively; subscript k represents η e x , J e t , ψ C E x C , J e t , and I r ; subscript Si represents the different influence factors. For Case 1 and Case 2, the sensitivities of η e x , J e t and ψ C E x C , J e t present similar trends to the different influence factors as shown in Fig. 9 . The sensitivities of both η e x , J e t and ψ C E x C , J e t to S4 and S3 are the greatest for two cases, respectively. It indicates that the conversion efficiency of the platform chemicals (furfural and LA) to bio-jet fuel has the largest effect on the thermodynamic performance of bio-jet fuel production as well as the cumulative exergy consumption of the life cycle. Additionally, the sensitivities of η e x , J e t and ψ C E x C , J e t to S1 are also high (>45%), which indicate that the decrease in steam consumption of steam-stripping for furfural has a significant effect on enhancing the thermodynamic performance of bio-jet fuel. For influence factor S5, the sensitivities of η e x , J e t are relatively low with 28.1% and 26.8% for Case 1 and Case 2, respectively, but the sensitivities of ψ C E x C , J e t reach 71.4% and 68.5%, respectively. The reason is that the resource consumption from the production stage of methanol results in an important effect on the cumulative exergy of the bio-jet fuel life cycle. It implies that the methanol consumption should be concerned. However, the sensitivities of η e x , J e t and ψ C E x C − J e t to S2 exhibit lower than the other factors due to its small basic conversion efficiency (only 29%). On the other hand, the sensitivities of I r are shown in Fig. 10 . The S5 is the most sensitive factor affecting I r for both cases because the methanol is regarded to be produced from fossil fuel in this study. However, the other influence indicators affect mainly the consumption of renewable resource. The sensitivities of I r to S4 for both cases are also higher than other indicators. The reason is that the conversion efficiency of the oxygenates to bio-jet fuel also affects hydrogen consumption, which brings about non-renewable resource consumption for hydrogen production. It also can be found that the sensitivities of I r to S1, S2, and S3 are weak because the three influence parameters mainly affect the amount of renewable resource consumption so that the response changes are small."
8,Conclusion,"The two cases of bio-jet fuel production from corn stalk via aqueous conversion were simulated, analyzed and compared. Some conclusions are drawn as follows. ● From both perspectives of the bio-jet production and the life cycle, Case 1 achieves greater energy and exergy efficiencies than Case 2. However, Case 2 possesses higher renewability due to the decrease of non-renewable resource consumption of the hydrogen production for the hydrogenation & upgrading. ● The decrease of acid and base consumptions and the increase of methanol recovery rate are beneficial for enhancing the cumulative exergy efficiency of the system. ● The recovery utilization of waste heat and wastewater from aqueous conversion can increase the energy and exergy efficiencies of both cases. However, the improvement in energy efficiency is observably greater than that of exergy efficiency, indicating that the recovery energy mainly belongs to the low-quality heat energy. ● The sensitivity analyses indicate that the conversion efficiency of the platform chemicals (furfural and LA) to bio-jet fuel and the consumption of stripping steam significantly affect both η e x , J e t and ψ C E x C , J e t . Additionally, the recovery rate of methanol exhibits a noticeable effect on the cumulative exergy efficiency but a small effect on the exergy efficiency of bio-jet fuel production. Thus, the thermodynamic performance analysis combined with LCA can comprehensively reflect the resource consumption of bio-jet fuel."
