0,Introduction,"In an effort to decarbonise the energy system, renewable energy sources for generation of power in the EU has expanded significantly over the last 10 years with a target of 20 % renewable energy consumption by 2020 and 27 % by 2030 [1]. However, the intermittent availability of these renewable energy sources (wind, solar etc.) has driven the need for high capacity energy storage methods [2]. Hydrogen is an ideal energy carrier as it is versatile, clean [3] and can be produced via water electrolysis to be used as fuel in fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) or stationary fuel cell technologies, as a heating fuel or as industrial feedstock [4]. Additionally, hydrogen is identified as the best alternative for a decarbonised gas grid, transport sector and high-grade heat source in industrial processes [3]. Efficient storage and utilisation of hydrogen require compression to 87.5 MPa or higher in order to refuel a FCEV at 70 MPa [5]. This hydrogen compression is typically accomplished by mechanical compression [6]. However, the adiabatic mechanical compression of hydrogen is energy-intensive [7–9] which results in a low energy efficiency of the hydrogen technology cycle. Moreover, hydrogen is currently predominately produced by steam methane reforming (SMR) which requires purification in order to meet FCEV H2 feed standards [10] which further increases the cost of the hydrogen fuel. Electrochemical hydrogen pumps (EHPs or H2 Pump) purify and compress hydrogen in a single stage with no moving parts and silent operation [7–9,11,12]. In addition, the energy required to compress H2 to 100 MPa using an EHP is ∼ 4 kW h/kgH2 compared to 6.6 kW h/kgH2 for mechanical compression [7,13,14]. Simultaneously to compression, the EHP system also reduces CO2 impurities by 5000 fold and CO impurities by 1000 fold [12]. EHP systems employ the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), Eq. [1], on the anode and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), Eq. [2], on the cathode, separated by a proton exchange membrane (PEM). (1) H y d r o g e n O x i d a t i o n R e a c t i o n : H 2 → 2 H + + 2 e - (2) H y d r o g e n E v o l u t i o n R e a c t i o n : 2 H + + 2 e - → H 2 The protons formed during the HOR are transferred through the membrane in the same manner as in hydrogen PEM fuel cells [15–17], as the EHP utilises the same anodic reaction and a polymeric proton conduction membrane. The protons are reduced at the cathode, which becomes pressurised, to form compressed hydrogen. Since the membrane is proton-selective, the impurities in the hydrogen feed to the anode are significantly reduced in the compressed hydrogen product at the cathode7. The Rotating Disc Electrode (RDE) technique is typically used to characterise electrocatalysts for the hydrogen oxidation [18–22] and hydrogen evolution [19,19,20,21,22] reactions for applications in hydrogen PEM Fuel Cells and polymer electrolyte water electrolysis, respectively. However, the drawback of the RDE technique for EHP systems (HOR and HER) is the low mass transport of H2 in the electrolyte towards and away from the electrode surface. For the HOR this results in a limiting current at low overpotentials (>50 mV) [23]. Furthermore, since the mass transport of reactant gas to the surface of the RDE is slow, investigations into poison tolerances of electrocatalysts is unreliable. The RDE technique is also not ideal for the HER as H2 bubble formation on the surface of the electrode, even at moderate overpotentials, obstruct the electrode surface [24]. The mass transport limitations, both to and from the electrode surface experienced on the RDE, may be overcome by utilising a porous electrode structure which floats on the surface of an aqueous electrolyte [24–31]. This ‘floating electrode’ technique was recently adapted and improved in order to investigate HOR and HER catalysts from -200 mV to 1100 mV vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode). The technique uses a low-loading and high mass transport electrode setup in which the entire electrode structure is only 10−15 μm thick [24,27–30]. This study investigates the low-loading, high mass transport ‘floating electrode’ technique for EHP catalyst characterisations, focusing on pure and 20 ppm CO poisoned H2 feeds. Cyclic voltammograms of Pt/C, PtRu/C and PtNi/C catalysts on the floating electrode and EHP system are compared, and the effect of poisoning with 20 ppm CO in both the ex-situ and in-situ systems is discussed. Moreover, a brief discussion on the kinetic modelling of CO poisoning on the floating electrode is included in order to understand the transient responses. Finally, an assessment on the suitability of the floating electrode technique for EHP catalyst characterisation is made."

2,Catalysts,"2.1 Catalysts The as-received catalysts were used, Pt/C (TANAKA Kikinzoku Kogyo K.K. (TKK), TEC10E50TPM™) with 47.8 wt% Pt loading, PtRu/C (TANAKA Kikinzoku Kogyo K.K., TEC61E54™) with 54 wt% metal loading and Pt:Ru atomic ratio of 1:1.5 and PtNi/C (Fuel Cell Store, 3151653) with 40 wt% metal loading and Pt:Ni atomic ratio of 3:1. All metal loadings were measured by the manufacturers on the batches used."
3,Floating electrode experiments,"2.2 Floating electrode experiments 2.2.1 Electrode preparation The working electrodes were prepared similarly to as described by Zalitis et al. [27] and Jackson et al. [29], an image is shown in Fig. 1 (A) (inset). Gold layers of 100 nm were sputtered (Emitech K575X) onto ultra-flat porous polycarbonate track etched (PCTE) membranes (Sterlitech, PCTF0447100) with a thickness of 12 μm, a pore diameter of 400 nm, a porosity of 0.125, pore tortuosity of 1, and a pore density of 108pores cm−2. These Au coated PCTE membranes were cleaned with isopropanol in a soxhlet extractor for 8 h, followed by 18.2 MΩ.cm water in the Soxhlet extractor for 8 h. Two catalyst inks were prepared for each catalyst, a concentrated ink which was then used to prepare a dilute catalyst ink. The concentrated catalyst ink was prepared using 5 mg of catalyst in 3 mL of a 3:1 solution of isopropanol:water solution, this was sonicated for 30 min before a 2:1 ratio of carbon:Nafion® using a 5 wt% Nafion® dispersion (Sigma Aldrich) was added and the concentrated ink was sonicated for a further 45 min. 1 μL of the concentrated catalyst ink (corresponding to approximately 1μgPt of catalyst) was diluted with 1 mL of a 3:1 solution of isopropanol:water, and 250 μL of the dilute ink was then vacuum filtered onto the gold-coated PCTE membrane with a catalyst layer diameter of 2 mm. After filtration of the catalyst, ∼1 μL of a hydrophobic layer of an amorphous fluoropolymer (AF) (DuPont DeNemours, trade name Teflon AF 2400, 2.1 μg.cm−2 Geo) dissolved in Fluorinert FC-40 (Sigma, F9755) was applied to the flip side of the membrane to the deposited catalyst layer. The electrodes were dried at 70 °C for 8 h at 25 mbar and then cleaned in the Soxhlet extractor in 18.2 MΩ.cm water for 4 h. The metal loadings and roughness factors are given in Table 1 . 2.2.2 Electrochemical characterisation Electrochemical characterisations were measured in N2 saturated 1 M HClO4 (Merck Suprapur®) electrolyte solutions at room temperature and pressure in a three-electrode setup (Fig. 1(A)), utilising a hydrogen reference electrode and gold counter electrode. The electrode was floated catalyst face down on the surface of the electrolyte. All glassware was cleaned in NOCHROMIX® and boiled 6 times in ultra-pure water before each experiment. Cyclic voltammograms were measured with H2 purged (6.8 N purity, Airproducts BIP® Plus) headspace of the cell above the electrode with a scan rate of 20 mV.s−1 in the potential range of ∼0.08 – 1 V vs. RHE for Pt/C, ∼0.08 – 0.8 V vs. RHE for PtRu/C and ∼0.08 – 0.8 V vs. RHE for PtNi/C. Chronoamperometry was performed at 100 mV vs. RHE with H2 + 20 ppm CO flowed to the back of the electrode (H2, 6.8 N purity Airproducts BIP® Plus mixed with 1000 ppm CO/Ar, BOC Gases). A total flow rate of 1 L.min−1 of gas (H2 or H2 + 20 ppm CO) was used in order to maintain uniform conditions at all times. CO stripping voltammetry was used to determine the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), the potential was held at 0.2 V vs. RHE for 10 min in 1000 ppm CO/Ar (BOC Gases) and then 10 min in a N2 purged headspace, and cyclic voltammetry was measured with a potential range of 0.06–1 V vs. RHE with a scan rate of 20 mV.s−1. Since some catalyst was lost through the pores of the membrane during vacuum filtration [11], the Pt loadings were determined by dissolution of the electrodes in aqua regia overnight and measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Furthermore, the ECSA’s determined on the floating electrode (FE) were compared to the RDE to confirm the metal loading on the floating electrode [27]."
4,Rotating disc electrode experiments,"2.3 Rotating disc electrode experiments 2.3.1 Electrode preparation Glassy carbon (GC) electrodes (Pine Instruments) with 5 mm diameter were polished using 0.1 and 0.05 μm alumina polish (Buehler) and sonicated for 1 min in isopropanol (VWR Chemicals) and 18.2 M.Ω.cm water (Millipore). Catalyst inks for rotating disc electrode experiments were prepared with 5 mg of catalyst in 5 ml 18.2 MΩ.cm water (Millipore) and 1.5 ml isopropanol (VWR Chemicals), sonicated for 30 min, followed by 2:1 ratio of carbon:Nafion® using 5 wt% Nafion® (Sigma Aldrich), and sonicated for a further 45 min and 10 μL was placed on the GC electrode. The GC electrode was rotated at 700 rpm in air while the catalyst ink dried. The Pt loading on the RDE was 20 μgPt. cm−2 with a roughness factor of 16.7, calculated from CO Stripping voltammetry (i.e. an ECSA of 83.6 m2. g-1 Pt). 2.3.2 Electrochemical characterisation All glassware was cleaned in NOCHROMIX® and boiled 6 times in 18.2 M Ω.cm water. Electrochemical characterisations were measured in 0.1 M HClO4 (Merck Suprapur®) electrolyte solutions at room temperature and pressure in a three-electrode setup, utilising a hydrogen reference electrode and gold counter electrode. Chronoamperometry was performed at 100 mV vs. RHE with H2 + 20 ppm CO bubbled in the electrolyte (H2, 6.8 N purity Airproducts BIP® Plus mixed with 1000 ppm CO/Ar, BOC Gases). HOR/HER linear sweep voltammetry was measured in H2 (6.8 N purity Airproducts BIP® Plus) saturated electrolyte with a potential range of -0.05 – 0.4 V vs. RHE and a scan rate of 1 mV.s−1. CO stripping voltammetry was used to determine the CO oxidation onset potential and electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), the potential was held at 0.1 V vs. RHE for 20 min in CO (BOC Gases) and 20 min in an N2 saturated 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte, and cyclic voltammetry was measured with a scan rate of 20 mV.s−1."
5,Electrochemical hydrogen pump,"2.4 Electrochemical hydrogen pump 2.4.1 Electrode and Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) preparation Gas diffusion electrodes have been prepared by screen printing an ink containing an alcohol/water mixture, TANAKA Kikinzoku Kogyo K.K., TEC10E50E™ carbon black supported Platinum catalyst, TANAKA Kikinzoku Kogyo K.K., TEC61E54™ carbon black supported 1:1.5 Platinum:Ruthenium alloy catalyst or carbon supported 3:1 Platinum:Nickel alloy catalyst (Fuel Cell Store, 3151653) and a Nafion™ ionomer dispersion type D2020 on SGL Carbon Sigracet 28BC™ gas diffusion substrate, resulting in a gravimetrically determined Pt loading of 0.15+/- 0.02 mg Pt/cm2. Typical 7-layer MEA’s (5 cm2) have been prepared by hot laminating between two Teflon coated laminating plates (T = 137 °C; 2 min; 11 N/mm2) a 50 μm thick Nafion 212™ proton exchange membrane sandwiched between two gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs), framed using a sub-gasket existing of two standard office laminating pouch films (100 um thick) with cut-outs for the GDEs. 2.4.2 Electrochemical characterisation MEAs of 5 cm2 were pre-conditioned using the humidification and break-in protocols defined in the 2009 US Department of Energy protocol for single-cell MEA testing [32]. EHP cell potentials were corrected for iR loses using the cell resistance determined from high frequency electrochemical impedance. Hence, all cell voltages are reported as iR-free. Fig. 1(B) shows a schematic diagram and an image of the single cell setup. EHP polarisation curves, polarised at each point for 5 min, and cyclic voltammograms at 20 mV.s−1 were measured at 35 °C with 75 % RH pure H2 feed to the anode at a flowrate of 0.2 L.min−1, cell potential corrected for high-frequency resistance. Chronoamperometry was measured at cell potentials of 100 mV and 200 mV at 35 °C with 75 % RH H2 + 20 ppm CO mixture (AirProducts Ltd.) feed to the anode at a flowrate of 0.2 L.min−1, with the cell potential corrected for high-frequency resistance. The chronoamperometry under pure H2 at 100 mV and 200 mV was repeated to determine the current density error range on the measurement. The EHP system was run at atmospheric pressure on the anode and cathode so that direct comparisons to ex-situ measurements, namely RDE and the floating electrode, could be made. The MEA metal loadings are given in Table 2 , the Pt loading on the anode and cathode was fixed at 170 μgPt. cm-2 to represent commercial EHP MEAs."
6,Electrochemical modelling,"2.5 Electrochemical modelling Eq. 12 (see below) was fitted in Excel, solving for the parameters n , k and j 0 . Generalised Reduced Gradient (GDG) non-linear solver with Multistart and a population of 100 was used to fit the experimental data with the function, as previously described in Kucernak and Zalitis for HOR [30]. GDG non-linear solver with Multistart determines the global minimum statistically by randomly sampling the result using a large population of starting parameters"
7,Results and discussion,
8,CO stripping of different catalysts,"3.1 CO stripping of different catalysts Displayed in Fig. 2 (A) are the CO stripping curves for all three catalysts used in this study. We used the CO stripping process to measure the electrochemically active surface area of the catalysts deposited on our electrodes assuming a CO stripping charge of 420 μC. cm−2 [33]. We also show the second scan following the CO stripping process for each of the different catalysts. The CO process was used because the hydrogen underpotential deposition (UPD) process becomes unreliable for low loadings of catalysts and can underestimate the amount of catalyst deposited. Of the three catalysts, Pt/C has the highest CO oxidation peak potential, followed by PtNi/C and then PtRu/C, where PtRu/C is most active for adsorbed CO oxidation as seen from the lowest CO onset potential. The CO tolerance of PtRu/C catalysts is well documented in literature [34–36] and is frequently attributed to the ‘ligand effect’ and/or the ‘bifunctional mechanism’ [37–45]. The ‘ligand effect’ suggests electronic interactions between the alloy and Pt which results in a weaker bond between COad and the Pt surface [43] and the ‘bifunctional mechanism’ refers to the facilitated COad oxidation on Pt sites by oxygen species adsorbed on Ru sites (Ru-OH) [43]. The mechanism of CO electro-oxidation on Pt/C, PtRu/C and PtNi/C is defined in Eq [3]–[5], assuming Ni in PtNi/C assists in CO oxidation from Pt via the ‘ligand effect’ [43]. (3) P t + H 2 O ⇌ P t - O H + H + + e - (4) R u + H 2 O ⇌ R u - O H + H + + e - (5) P t - C O + P t / R u - O H ⇌ 2 P t + C O 2 + H + + e - The RDE is an inappropriate approach to study the HOR/HER as mass transport to the catalyst surface is too slow. As a result, close to the equilibrium potential the measured current is solely composed of the mass transport limited current, and no kinetic information can be extracted. The HOR/HER performance on an RDE for the Pt/C catalyst is shown in Fig. 2(B) (expanded in the inset). The HOR response is relatively featureless as the limiting current is reached within ∼ 50 mV of the equilibrium potential [23]. As described in the introduction, our approach to taking measurements is to use a modification of the floating electrode approach which utilises ultra-thin and highly porous electrodes (12 μm thick) to support the catalyst and allow fast access of gaseous reactants to the catalyst surface. This is shown in Fig. 2(B) in which the mass activity of the Pt/C catalyst is shown using our floating electrode approach. Note that the mass activity is ∼1000-fold larger than the limiting current of the RDE. Furthermore, this improved performance is extended to the HER region where the floating approach also significantly outperforms the RDE as there is no interference from bubbles during the hydrogen evolution reaction. Furthermore in the inset in Fig. 2(B) the HOR and HER results show much steeper variations on the floating electrode than the RDE results as the RDE results are limited by hydrogen mass transport, even close to the equilibrium potential – i.e. in the regions where there is no limiting current. A number of interesting aspects can also be noted from the response towards the HOR. There is a sharp onset for hydrogen oxidation (much faster than for the RDE – see Fig. 2(B,inset)), followed by the presence of two peaks, and a reduction of HOR at higher potentials [24,27,29,30]. The double peak structure and suppression of HOR at higher potentials (below the potential associated with oxide formation) have been assigned to the activity of edges and facets, and anion adsorption respectively [28]. Anion adsorption and oxide formation/reduction is also responsible for the hysteresis of the voltammetry. The HOR mass activity measured on the Pt/C catalyst (∼70 A.mg-1 metal) using the FE is lower than previously reported for different Pt/C commercial catalysts measured at lower loadings with the FE technique (380–500 A. mg−1 metal) [27,29]. This is due to the previous catalysts being optimised for the HOR due to small platinum particle size with a high ratio of edge sites, shown to be advantageous in the hydrogen reaction [28]. Also, the determination of electrochemical surface area and metal loading in this study has been improved by using CO stripping for surface area determination and post experimentation digestion of the electrodes in aqua regia and platinum mass determination by ICP-MS."
9,"High mass transport, low loading electrocatalyst testing for the HOR/HER in pure hydrogen","3.2 High mass transport, low loading electrocatalyst testing for the HOR/HER in pure hydrogen Fig. 3 (A) shows a comparison of the cyclic voltammetry over a wide potential range (-0.08 V – 0.8/1 V) for the three catalysts (Pt/C, PtRu/C and PtNi/C catalysts) using pure H2. The measured maximum mass activities reported of 68–93 A.mgmetal −1) are within similar current ranges compared to previously reported studies on different Pt/C catalysts [27,29]. Additionally, this figure demonstrates the potential dependence of the catalyst HOR mass activities as Pt/C and PtRu/C present similar HOR mass activities at potentials of 0 – 0.2 V, while the HOR mass activity on PtNi/C at potentials below 0.2 V is less than Pt/C and PtRu/C. However, PtNi/C exceeds the other catalysts at potentials above 0.2 V as it would appear to be less susceptible to anion adsorption effects. The typical EHP system cell potential ranges 0 – 0.5 V depending on the desired H2 production rate, thus the potentials experienced at the anode and cathode range ∼ 0 – 0.3 V and 0 – -0.2 V, respectively, depending on the applied cell potential and catalyst HOR/HER activities. Hence the operation of the electrocatalysts in these potential ranges are of critical importance for selecting the anode and cathode electrocatalyst in the EHP system. At anode potentials of < 0.2 V the Pt/C and PtRu/C catalysts have the highest mass activities and at potentials > 0.2 V the PtNi/C catalyst exhibits higher HOR mass activities. Table 3 collects the performance of catalysts at suitable overpotentials (130 mV for HOR and −70 mV for HER), with the overpotentials chosen so that the magnitude of performance of the catalyst in pure hydrogen are approximately the same for HOR and HER. Note that the sum of overpotentials (200 mV) is the same as the iR-free cell potential used for the EHP for some of the experiments below. Also shown in the table is the performance under CO containing conditions and the percentage reduction in performance. In all cases the measurements were taken from the anodic scan."
10,"High mass transport, low loading electrocatalyst testing for the HOR/HER in H2/20 ppm CO","3.3 High mass transport, low loading electrocatalyst testing for the HOR/HER in H2/20 ppm CO Fig. 3(B)–(D) report the cyclic voltammograms of the three different catalysts and compares their response under pure hydrogen and H2/ 20 ppm CO feeds. A 20 ppm CO/H2 gas feed is representative of the upper CO concentration expected in the hydrogen product stream from a steam methane reformer (SMR) coupled to a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) system [10,46,47] or the lower CO limit from a SMR only. All catalysts show a reduction in HOR and HER activity after the introduction of CO (Table 3), however these catalysts exhibit different CO tolerances. PtRu/C is the most CO tolerant as it shows the lowest drop in HOR activity of only 35 % at 130 mV overpotential, while Pt/C and PtNi/C both exhibit decreases of 49 % and 78 % respectively. All three catalysts also show a suppression of the HER in the presence of CO, due to blocking of Pt sites. The ordering is the same as for the HOR, although the performance decrease is only about 1/2 -1/3 of that seen for the HOR results. In light of the results presented in Fig. 2(A) it is unsurprising that in the presence of 20 ppm CO, PtRu shows the smallest suppression of the HOR followed by Pt and PtNi (Fig. 3(B)-(D)). For all three catalysts, reactivation of the HOR associated with CO oxidation is seen at elevated potentials. This is most clear for the case of PtNi, as this catalyst is the most severely poisoned, and shows a pronounced hysteresis associated with reduced CO coverage on the reverse scan. However, small increases close to the respective CO oxidation potentials (Fig. 2(A)) are also evident for the other two catalysts on the forward scans. A comparison of the geometric currents in Fig. 2(A) with those for the HOR in Fig. 3(B)–(D) show that we would not expect to see the current associated with the CO oxidation in the latter plots as the HOR currents are orders of magnitude larger than the CO oxidation currents. Instead, we indirectly see the effect of the CO oxidation in increasing the number of sites available for hydrogen oxidation. At low potentials during HOR, or during the HER, the ‘bifunctional mechanism’ on PtRu/C is unlikely to aid CO tolerance as COad is not oxidised at potentials below 0.1 V [38]. Igarashi et al. [43] investigated CO adsorption on Pt alloys using in-situ FTIR and concluded a weakening of the Pt and COad bond is the reason for a higher CO tolerance on these catalysts. Later, Uchida et al. [38] reported a decrease in COad adsorption rate due to the enhanced CO mobility resulting from the weakened Pt-COad bond as a consequence of the modified electronic structure of the Pt surface sites. The CO tolerance of PtNi/C during HOR is less studied than PtRu/C. Igarashi et al. [43]. also investigated PtNi/C by ex-situ XPS as well as RDE experiments and found this catalyst to be more CO tolerant than pure Pt, due to electronic interactions between Pt and Ni. However, in our investigation (Table 3) PtNi/C does not appear to be more CO tolerant during HOR than Pt/C but does show a lower CO oxidation onset potential ∼0.6 V compared to ∼0.7 V on Pt/C during CO stripping voltammetry (Fig. 2(A)). The CO tolerance of PtNi/C is further discussed below in the section, ‘Modelling the CO poisoning on the floating electrode’. 3.3.1 HOR Chronoamperometry comparison between the floating electrode and RDE Fig. 4 compares the chronoamperometric response at 0.1 V (RHE) seen when the feed gas is switched from pure hydrogen to H2/20 ppm on the Pt/C catalyst either deposited on an RDE or on the floating electrode. The performance for PtNi and PtRu catalysts on the floating electrode is also shown. The RDE results show little change over the time period of 4000 s whereas those for the floating electrode change significantly. The reason for the discrepancy is the low concentration and poor mass transport of CO in the RDE case, leading to a very slow flux of CO to the catalyst surface as it is an unsuitable system to test catalyst poisoning at poison levels relevant to fuel cell or hydrogen pump operation. The solubility (c0 ) and diffusion coefficient (D0 ) of carbon monoxide in solution in equilibrium with one atmosphere gaseous CO is 1 × 10−6 mol. cm-3 [48] and ∼ 2 × 10-5 cm2.s-1 [49], respectively. Assuming that the concentration of CO in solution follows Henry’s law, which is a reasonable assumption as we would not expect any specific interaction with the electrolyte, then we would expect the concentration of CO in the perchloric acid solution to be ∼ 2 × 10-11 mol.cm-3, when in equilibrium with the 20 ppm CO in H2 reactant gas. The flux (J) of reactant to a planar electrode follows Ficks first law (where the z direction is normal to the electrode surface) (Eq. [6]): (6) J = - D 0 ∂ c 0 ∂ z z = 0 Under the conditions that the RDE operates, the solution to the mass transport equations [31] give Eq. [7]: (7) J = - 0.620 D 0 2 / 3 υ - 1 / 6 c 0 ω 1 / 2 Where ω is the angular velocity, υ is the kinematic viscosity and D 0 is the diffusion coefficient. The maximum rotation rate of RDEs are ω = 2500–7000 rpm [50,51], where 400–2500 rpm is typically used for HOR electrocatalyst characterisation [20,22,52]. Hence under the conditions that we are operating the RDE (ω = 1600 rpm), the flux of CO to the electrode surface is 2.6 × 10−13 mol. cm-2.s-1. The surface coverage of platinum atoms calculated from the density of platinum, and its crystal structure (face centred cubic) is Γo = 1.64 × 1015 atoms. cm-2 = 2.7 × 10-9 mol. cm-2. If the solution were saturated with pure CO, then the diffusion limited time to cover a platinum rotating disk electrode with a roughness factor of 1 would be 0.2 s. However, the solution concentration is much lower than the saturated concentration (only 20 ppm CO in the hydrogen used to saturate the solution), and hence the maximum flux of CO is much lower too. Furthermore, the RDE electrode has a roughness factor of 16.7 (loading of 20 μgPt. cm-2). Hence it would take 177 ks (49 h) to form a monolayer even under mass transport limiting conditions using a solution equilibrated with 20 ppm CO (i.e. a maximum rate of surface area loss of 0.0006 % s-1). After 4000 s we would only expect a surface area loss of ∼2.3 % which would be undetectable as it is within the error of the RDE measurement. For surfaces that are appreciably covered by CO, or for which the sticking coefficient is less than one, then the loss of surface area will be even slower. As the roughness factor of the electrode increases, then the maximum rate of loss of surface area decreases by an equivalent factor. The benefit of the floating electrode approach is that the design allows the electrolyte layer to be made much thinner than the RDE case, with the reactants transported through the gas phase with diffusion coefficients about 4 orders of magnitude faster than in the liquid phase (DCO,gas ≈ 0.242 cm2.s-1 [53]). Hence, not only may reactants reach the catalyst surface more quickly (ca. 1000-fold faster than the RDE limiting current – see Fig. 2(B)), but so too is the case for gaseous poisons, which may be quickly transported to the surface. In a similar manner to the RDE case, we can estimate the minimum time period required to poison the floating electrodes and fuel cell electrodes based on mass balance arguments. If we assume that all the CO entering the cell is adsorbed on the catalyst, then under conditions of defined flow and CO concentration and taking into account the electrode area and loading there is a minimum time for the formation of a CO monolayer. Table 4 tabulates those characteristic mass transport times for the RDE, the floating electrode, and the EHP anode electrodes used in this study. Contrarily to the RDE, due to the low catalyst loading (∼1/10th of RDE), and high mass transport of reactant to the catalyst layer (1 L.min−1), the characteristic time associated with mass transport of CO to the floating electrode surface is very fast, ∼six orders of magnitude faster than the RDE and about 3 orders of magnitude faster than the EHP anode. Poisoning of the catalysts due to the presence of 20 ppm CO was observable when using the floating electrode technique, although the times were not as fast as calculated and indicated in Table 4. In Fig. 4, it is seen that the CO tolerances at 0.1 V for the catalysts tested are consistent with the cyclic voltammograms reported above, PtRu/C shows the highest poison tolerance. It displays a τ1/2 (time for current to reduce to 50 % of its initial value) of 268 s, Pt/C shows a τ1/2 of 160 s and PtNi/C was rapidly poisoned showing a τ1/2 of 77 s. These values are larger than the characteristic times listed in Table 4, probably associated with a relatively large bypass of CO over the electrode, which is a requirement when trying to measure the kinetics of the process – i.e. there is not an appreciable consumption of the reactant at the catalyst surface. It might also indicate a kinetic limitation to the adsorption process, as suggested from the modelling seen below. 3.3.2 HER CV response on the floating electrode under poisoned and unpoisoned environments The HER activities at −70 mV (Table 3) on the catalysts follow the HOR trend at 130 mV in that Pt/C exhibits a significantly larger mass activity of -142 A.mgmetal −1 over PtRu/C and PtNi/C at -75.2 and -43.1 A.mgmetal −1, respectively, and this higher HER activity is seen at all reduction potentials. The effect of 20 ppm CO poisoning on HER was also investigated (Fig. 3 and Table 3) as some CO will migrate across the membrane in EHP systems in small quantities [12], moreover, CO2 in an H2 feed to the EHP will also migrate from the anode to the cathode in small quantities and subsequently undergo an electrochemical reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS) [54,55] at the cathode: (8) C O 2 + 2 H + + 2 e - ⇌ C O + H 2 O E o = - 0.061 V v s . N H E See Refs. [56,57] for electrochemical potential. The catalysts investigated are less effected by CO poisoning in the HER potential region compared to the HOR potential range (Table 3). Once more, the PtRu/C is the most CO tolerant catalyst, due to the electronic effect discussed above [38,43], as it retains 90 % of its HER activity at −70 mV after poisoning with 20 ppm CO. The Pt/C and PtNi/C catalysts retain 84 % and 58 % of the unpoisoned HER activity at −70 mV after poisoning, respectively. Despite the CO tolerance of PtRu/C, the Pt/C HER mass activity was markedly higher at −120 A.mgmetal −1 after CO poisoning compared to −68.1 A.mgmetal −1 on PtRu/C, therefore Pt/C is the best-tested cathode catalyst under these pure H2 and H2 + 20 ppm CO gas feed experimental conditions in the potential range of 0 – -0.07 V."
11,EHP system poisoning with 20 ppm carbon monoxide,"3.4 EHP system poisoning with 20 ppm carbon monoxide 3.4.1 EHP Polarisation curves and cyclic voltammograms The iR-free cell polarisation curves for three MEAs with different catalyst compositions are reported in Fig. 5 (A) and cyclic voltammograms at 20 mV.s−1 in Fig. 5(B) for MEAs with the Anode/Cathode catalyst configurations of Pt/Pt, PtRu/Pt and PtNi/Pt where Pt, PtRu and PtNi are the supported catalysts tested above on the floating electrode and RDE techniques. The polarisation curves and cyclic voltammograms normalised for geometric surface area of the MEA (5 cm2) are indistinguishable within error bounds for all MEA catalyst configurations investigated. Note that these are iR-free cell responses, and so the cell potential is composed of both the anode and cathode overpotentials (c.f. the FE measurements which are iR-free half-cell measurements). Similar current densities were obtained in other EHP studies, for instance, Kim et al. reported ∼1.1 A. cm-2 at 200 mV at 70 °C with an anode Pt loading of 200 μg.cm-2 [58] and Suermann et al. [11] reported ∼ 2 A. cm-2 at 200 mV at 60 °C with a relative humidity of 80 %. Bouwman [59] reported current densities of 0.5 A. cm-2 at 200 mV and Ströbel et al. [8] reported polarisation curves for a number of different commercial MEAs at 25 °C which achieved current densities between ∼0.12 – 0.5 A.cm-2 at 200 mV. The wide range of current densities was attributed to mass transport differences and iR differences between the MEAs. The hydrogen flowrate, relative humidity, temperature and MEA loading are not all specified in many cases, which complicates the comparison between literature, additionally, a standard protocol has not yet been established. The theoretical limiting current associated with the total consumption of H2, with a flowrate of 0.2 L.min−1, is 5.7 A. cm-2. Therefore, this limiting current density of ∼1.8 A. cm-2 for all MEAs is postulated to be due to the inherent diffusion limitations in the MEA layers or water transport issues (i.e. dehydration of the anode layer due to electroosmotic drag), as the current density in the EHP will be the same if the rate of reaction is limited by transport rather than kinetic limitations of the catalyst layer. In H2 PEM Fuel Cells, the mass transport controlled regime is observed at high current densities where the fuel cell performance is limited by the rate at which reactants and products are transported to and from the MEA, however this mass transport limitation is typically associated with water product transport out of the cell [60–63]. The EHP system must contend with a significant electroosmotic drag of water from the anode to the cathode, and this coupled with insufficient anode humidification at high current densities can lead to poor proton conductivity in the anode catalyst layer and membrane region adjacent to the anode. In other work, the mass transport limitations experienced in the EHP system are reportedly due to the mass transport limitations of hydrogen reaching the catalyst layer at the anode [64], thus explaining the identical polarisation curves and cyclic voltammograms between MEAs in Fig. 5(A) and (B). The inset in Fig. 5(B) reports mass activities of the MEAs, these show variation due to the differences in metal loadings between the MEAs rather than inherent differences in kinetic activity between the catalysts. 3.4.2 EHP chronoamperometry with 20 ppm CO The chronoamperometry curves at two iR-free cell potentials, 100 mV and 200 mV, are displayed in Fig. 5(C) and (D), respectively. The current densities of all MEAs are statistically similar between 0.97–1.11 A. cm−2 at 100 mV and 1.37–1.64 A.cm−2 at 200 mV cell potentials. The similarities between the MEAs under pure H2 during chronoamperometry are assigned to the transport limitations discussed above. However, upon switching the hydrogen feed from pure hydrogen to H2/20 ppm CO, the EHP systems with different MEA catalysts perform differently due to the differences in CO tolerances of the catalysts. A τ1/2 of 2470 – 2830s is observed when using the PtRu/Pt MEA, while Pt/Pt and PtNi/Pt MEAs show τ1/2 of less than 465 s and 260 s, respectively (Table 5 ). There is no trend between the time to poison and the different cell potentials (Table 5) since CO is not oxidised at low potentials [38], leading the CO tolerance of the catalyst to be determined by the ‘ligand effect’ which weakens the Pt-COad bond [43] rather than the ‘bifunctional mechanism’ which aids in the oxidation of CO and would thus be potential dependent. The τ1/2 times for Pt/C and PtNi/C are very similar to the characteristic mass transport times, τmonolayer , calculated in Table 4 of 570 and 210 s, respectively. This suggests that within the EHP cell, the rate of poisoning is being determined by the flow of CO into the cell and all the CO is being adsorbed on the catalyst surface i.e. faster poisoning is not possible as all CO entering the cell is poisoning the catalyst. In contrast, for PtRu/C, the characteristic time τ1/2 >> τmonolayer suggesting that the slow poisoning is not an instrumental artefact, but due to resilience in CO poisoning of PtRu/C as might be expected from the fuel cell literature."
12,Comparison and fitting,"3.5 Comparison and fitting 3.5.1 Floating electrode vs EHP cyclic voltammogram insights The mass activities achieved on the high mass transport technique, the floating electrode, are substantially larger (68–93 A.mgmetal −1) than the electrochemical H2 pump (6–12 A.mgmetal −1) (Fig. 6 (A)), further suggesting the hypothesis that the current density of the EHP system is limited by diffusion of H2, proton or water rather than other factors, such as kinetic limitations. Additionally, the comparison implies that if transport of H2 and water within the EHP system is optimised then the H2 production capacity, based on kinetic limitations of the catalyst, may be an order of magnitude larger than currently achieved. 3.5.2 Floating electrode vs EHP poisoning rates The FE measurements are performed in an electrochemical half cell (vs. RHE) and the EHP measurements are performed in a full cell (with cell potentials corrected for iR loses). Thus, the FE polarisation is only of the anode (oxidation) at 100 mV vs. RHE overpotential while the EHP polarisation is of both the anode (oxidation) and cathode (evolution) at 100 mV and 200 mV total cell potential (i.e. anode plus cathode overpotentials). Following from the assertions from the polarisation curves above, the current obtained by the EHP system is limited by the H2 transport, proton transport and/or H2O transport, thus the transport of CO poison would also be limited by mass transport to the catalyst layer. The floating electrode system is conducted under high mass transport conditions which results in rapid reduction in HOR from CO poisoning in the first 500 s for all catalysts (Fig. 6(B)-(D)), however, the Pt/C and PtRu/C HOR activities are almost stable over longer periods of time (> 500 s). This longer time partial stability in the presence of CO might be due to the faster rate of mass transport in the electrodes allowing a non-zero rate of CO desorption, the use of perchloric acid as an electrolyte which contains anions which adsorb on the catalyst surface less strongly than the sulfonate groups in the EHP systems. It also might be associated with CO transiting across the membrane and poisoning the cathode of the EHP system. Another possibility is the presence of small quantities of O2 (< 1 ppm) in the cell headspace in the floating electrode system which aid in CO tolerance, in a similar manner as O2 crossover or O2 bleed in H2 PEM Fuel Cells aid in CO tolerance of the anode catalysts [10,65,66]. The introduction of O2 to a HOR anode catalyst assists in heterogeneous oxidation of CO, rather than the electro-oxidation of CO which does not occur at low potentials [65]. This heterogeneous oxidation of CO proceeds via the chemical mechanism detailed in [9]-[11] [65, 67]. (9) O 2 + 2 P t ⇌ O 2 - P t + P t ⇒ 2 ( O - P t ) (10) C O + P t ⇌ C O - P t (11) C O - P t + O - P t ⇒ C O 2 + 2 P t Therefore the deviations between the EHP system and floating electrode system are twofold. Firstly, the initial poisoning effect in the EHP system is limited by the mass flow of CO into the cell while the floating electrode system poisons rapidly in the first 500 s owing to the high mass transport of gas to the catalyst layer. Secondly, at longer time periods the floating electrode results for Pt and PtRu tends towards a plateau which is higher than the equivalent plateau in the EHP case. Nonetheless, the trend in CO tolerant catalysts remains the same between the two techniques in the order PtRu > Pt > PtNi demonstrating the ability of the ex-situ floating electrode technique to accurately characterise the poison tolerance of catalysts for EHP systems. 3.5.3 Modelling the CO poisoning on the floating electrode In order to better understand the poisoning process, and introduce some predictive possibilities, we have attempted to model the CO poisoning process of the catalysts in the presence of gaseous CO. The effect on the hydrogen oxidation activity during CO poisoning when using the floating electrode technique is reliant on the number of free sites, where two possible adsorbates are present, Had, and COad. Binding of CO to a Pt site is difficult to model since different types of COad occur, namely linearly bonded, bridge bonded and 3-fold bonded [68–70], thus COad may occupy multiple Pt sites. Despite the complexities of the CO adsorption onto a Pt surface, the Langmuir isotherm has previously been used to fit RDE experimental data of HOR poisoned by different concentrations of CO [68]. However, this previous study and others alike are limited by mass transport of CO to the catalyst surface due to the limitations of mass transport in the RDE configuration (c.f Table 4) and therefore in those experiments poisoning of the electrode with CO took place over long periods of time or with high concentrations of CO [68,69,71,72]. As seen in Fig. 6, rapid poisoning of the floating electrodes with 20 ppm CO is observed in the first 500 s, owing to the high mass transport of reactant to the catalyst. Models of CO poisoning in PEM Fuel Cells have used the Temkin isotherm to model the transient behaviour, with [65] and without O2 bleeds [73], however another study which investigated CO poisoning at the anode of a PEM Fuel Cell found that CO adsorption was fast and only limited by mass diffusion to the anode [74]. Thus theoretical modelling of CO poisoning in PEM fuel cells is dominated by mass transport effects rather than kinetic effects and does not adequately represent the floating electrode system. In order to incorporate the complexities of the three adsorbates on the reaction kinetics in this study, the Langmuir-Hill isotherm was employed. The Langmuir-Hill isotherm is a variation of the Langmuir isotherm [75], however it takes into consideration that adsorption is a cooperative phenomenon and thus binding of a species to one site may influence different binding sites around the adsorption site [76]. The Langmuir-Hill isotherm accounts for the effect of adsorption site interactions with other sites by allowing the number of sites in which an adsorbate is adsorbed or occupied/influenced to be a non-integer. In this study, the Langmuir-Hill isotherm was utilised in order to take into consideration the complications associated with COad bonding, which is varied in the number of sites occupied and also changes with CO coverage [77–79], thus the number of sites occupied is also time-dependent. The fitted equation based on the Langmuir-Hill isotherm is described in Eq. [12]. (12) j j m a x = 1 - j m a x - j m i n j m a x 1 1 + k n t - t 0 n Where j is the measured current, j m a x and j m i n are the maximum and minimum currents, t is time in s, t 0 is the short time delay before the poisoning process starts due to instrumental delays (8−64 s in this study depending on the catalyst, seen in Table 6 ), n is related to the average number of free platinum sites affected by the CO adsorption step and k is the characteristic absorption time in s. The modelled fit is shown in Fig. 6(B)-(D) and the characteristic time, number of absorption sites are reported in Table 6. The model fits the experimental data well, much better than expressions which assume a first order adsorption mechanism. The number of sites occupied or affected by the adsorption of an adsorbate ( n ) is similar for Pt/C and PtRu/C but the characteristic absorption time about ∼3 times slower on PtRu/C. The results show a similar value of n which suggests the binding mechanisms are similar between Pt/C and PtRu/C. The PtNi/C on the other hand, has a characteristic adsorption time which is slower compared to Pt/C likely also due to a weakening of the Pt-CO bond by the ‘ligand effect’ [43]. The CO tolerance of the PtNi/C catalyst, hypothesised here to be due to an electronic effect, is also evident from the lower CO onset potential measured during CO stripping voltammetry (Fig. 2(A)). However, the higher n value indicates that CO bonding to these surfaces undergoes a different mechanism affecting ∼2.7x more sites than Pt/C and PtRu/C, thus CO poisoning is rapid and deactivation is similar to platinum."
13,Conclusion,"This study investigated the floating electrode technique as a tool to characterise electrocatalysts for EHP systems. Cyclic voltammograms on the floating electrode and EHP systems were compared, as well as transient curves from poisoning the HOR with 20 ppm CO. It is shown that the RDE system is incapable of being used to make kinetic measurements on the CO poisoning process using low concentrations of CO due to the low mass flux of species to the electrode surface. For EHP systems, the poisoning process is likewise limited by mass transport of CO into the cell. The floating electrode technique observed mass activities of 68–93 A.mgmetal −1 which were significantly higher than the electrochemical H2 pump (6–12 A.mgmetal −1). This observation implies that the current density measured in an EHP has some degree of mass transport limitation (most likely due to water electroosmotic drag starving the anode of water [59]) rather than being kinetically limited. Therefore, if mass transport of water to the anode catalyst layer and back diffusion of water from the cathode to the anode is optimised in the EHP system then the H2 production capacity may be increased by an order of magnitude. Moreover, the floating electrode CVs showed a potential dependence on the HOR performance of catalysts as Pt/C and PtRu/C had higher HOR activities at potentials 0 – 0.2 V but above these potentials PtNi/C obtained higher mass activities. These key findings of transport limitation on EHP and potential dependence of HOR on different catalysts are not apparent from RDE studies as these are all mass transport limited and reach a limiting current at potentials above 0.05 V. CO poisoning of the EHP and floating electrode systems showed the same trend in catalyst CO tolerance of PtRu/C > Pt/C > PtNi/C. The rate of poisoning for Pt/C and PtNi/C in the EHP systems was limited by the rate of CO flowing into the system. As the provision of CO in an EHP was limited, the transient reduction in activity was slower than on the floating electrode system which poisoned rapidly in the first 500 s, owing to the high mass transport of gas to the catalyst layer. Lastly, a kinetic model was proposed for the modelling of the floating electrode transient responses from CO poisoning. The model used, based on the Langmuir-Hill isotherm, took into consideration the complex nature of COad over time, by allowing the number of sites blocked or influenced by the adsorbate to be non-integer and greater than one. This model fits the floating electrode transients well and suggested the CO tolerance of the PtRu/C catalyst was primarily due to a longer characteristic absorption time when compared to Pt/C. Furthermore, the model proposed that the rapid poisoning on the PtNi/C catalyst was due to differences in the number of sites partaking in the adsorption of adsorbates (∼2.7x larger than Pt/C) rather than rate constant of the reaction."
