0,Introduction,"Over the past few decades, the water shortage and environmental pollution became one of the most complex problems in developing sustainable human society, especially for developing countries. Rapidly growing industrial activities for printing and dyeing purposes have been polluting fresh and clean water reservoirs at an alarming scale [1]. Moreover, the aquatic environment is also facing a serious threat due to the high levels of heavy metal ions and organic contaminants coming from industrial effluents [2–5]. Synthetic dyes are considered as primary organic pollutants and it has been recorded that higher than 700,000 metric tons of dye are synthesized annually of which around 20% is lost in industrial wastewater [6,7]. The synthetic dyes have adverse characteristics as these are non-biodegradable, resistant to light and water oxidation, attributed to their complex aromatic frameworks [8]. Additionally, dyes spread over water surfaces prevent sunlight to reach aquatic organism and interrupt overall photosynthesis process [9]. Therefore, dye removal from polluted water is a matter of immediate concern. Among various synthetic dyes, Methylene blue (MB) is widely consumed in the cotton and silk industry and its elevated levels in water are harmful to both human health and aquatic life as it can cause nervous system breakdown, liver and kidney failure, and skin allergies [10,11]. Different methods are being used for MB removal from wastewater including ozone treatment [12] , photocatalysis [13] , adsorption [14,15], and ion exchange [16,17]. Among these methods, adsorption by carbon-based materials is considered as a facile, economic viable, and safest method for organic-dye removal without producing any harmful by-products [18] . In particular, due to its abundance and fast growth, biomass-derived ACs were found to be a promising candidate for dye removal [19,20]. However, no significant work has been carried out in designing such a material that includes all traits e.g., 1) high SSA to provide abundant sites for dye adsorption; 2) highly hierarchical porous carbon framework with interconnected micro/mesopores for dye molecules rapid transportation by reducing diffusion pathways; 3) heteroatom doping (i.e., N, S content) which increase wettability and enhance pore accessibility and improve electrostatic interactions through hydrogen bonding and/or acid-base interactions between adsorbate dye molecules and ACs (adsorbent) surfaces [21] . Moreover, in addition to all aforementioned characteristics, highly hydrophilic nature of ACs further facilitate adsorption and ionic diffusion of dye molecules inside porous carbon skeleton [22,23]. So far, the prepared carbon materials include either complex synthetic strategies or environmentally hazardous which restrict their large-scale applications. Therefore, finding renewable and low-cost carbon precursors to prepare ACs has become a research flashpoint over the last few years [24–26]. Recently, various studies for the successful fabrication of porous carbons with remarkably high specific surface area and pore volume have been reported by varying the activation temperature and chemical activating agent (KOH) concentration, for efficient gas adsorption [27–32]. Moreover, many studies demonstrated preparation of ACs from various biomasses such as peanut hull [33] , coconut shell [34,35], cotton stalk [36] and from waste materials e.g., sunflower piths [37] , watermelon rind [38] , Elaeagnus stone [39] , denim fabric [40] , and Arundo donax [41] etc. for wastewater treatment. However, the dye removal efficiency of these ACs is severely limited. To improve dye molecules adsorption on carbon surfaces, pore surface functionalization is a promising technique. The ACs doped with nitrogen, and sulfur functionalities induces polarity in the framework by altering the surficial chemical composition of the adsorbents [42] . These charged sites are considered as favorable anchoring positions for cationic MB molecules. Therefore, it is expected that polar surfaces induce electrostatic interactions, acid-base interactions, and hydrogen bonding with incoming polar adsorbate molecules thereby enhancing the dye adsorption capacities of adsorbents [43] . In addition to organic pollutants, the drastic reduction of oil reserves due to excessive use not only increases price but also damage sustainable environment and thus require immediate measures to reap alternative fuels which are cheap, environmentally friendly, and readily available in nature. Hydrogen is one of the alternative fuels which could replace traditionally used petrol-fuel in vehicles and drive futuristic hydrogen-based economy a reality [44] . In addition, it possesses high energy density of 142 MJ/kg (chemical energy ~39 kW h/kg) and is considered as carbon-free fuel by virtue of only water by-product during its combustion [45] . However, safely storing H2 is still a challenge faced by researchers and the scientific community. Cryogenic adsorption of H2 is one of the efficient methods to harvest H2 storage [46] . In this regard, carbonaceous materials are continuously exploited for H2 physisorption owing to their tunable porosity and large SSA. In a report, Gogotsi et al.,[47] studied carbonaceous materials with different pore-sizes and demonstrated that H2 cryo-sorption increases with decreasing pore size. However, a complete understanding of the adsorption mechanism of H2 storage in carbonaceous materials is still needed. Herein, a widely available and economically cheap biomass-derived carbohydrate (sucrose) was used as carbon source. Keeping in mind eco-friendly adsorbent synthesis, KOH is intentionally avoided. Despite of high porosity generation, KOH offers serious problems including equipment corrosion and environmental toxicity. Therefore, in present work we opted for an environmental benign activating agent, potassium carbonate (K2CO3) as it is generally used in food additives. Here, K2CO3 activated samples (PC-13) exhibit moderately high SSA (1838 m2/g) and well-defined supermicropores (>1 nm). Interestingly, upon urea/thiourea modification, the prepared samples (NPC-X and NSPC-X) exhibit a drastic increase in SSA up to 2842 m2/g, ultra-micropores (<0.7 nm) generation, and heterogenous surface chemical composition (N: 4.1 at%, S: 2.1 at%) which cumulatively leads to an efficient MB adsorption (398.09 mg/g) from wastewater. Further, as-prepared carbons demonstrate a high H2 adsorption (2.21 wt%) attributed to the large population of narrow micropores (~ 0.68 nm). Therefore, the present work is an effort devoted to showcase the ultimate potential of as-prepared carbon-based adsorbents for both energy and environmental applications using a facile, cheap, and benign synthetic approach."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Sucrose (99%), urea (99%), thiourea (99%), potassium carbonate (K2CO3~95%), and HCl (99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich to design a series of heteroatom-enriched microporous carbons."
3,Synthetic protocol,"2.2 Synthetic protocol Microporous carbons were synthesized via two-step carbonization and activation of sucrose using K2CO3 as chemical activating agent and urea/thiourea as N/N, S-dopants. In the first step, 10 g of sucrose was carbonized at 600 °C for 1 h in nitrogen gas at a heating rate of 3 °C/min. Afterwards, the carbonized sucrose was ground with urea/thiourea and K2CO3 in desired mass ratios in a laboratory pulveriser for 30 s. Later, the homogeneous powder was loaded in the alumina boat and transferred to an electric furnace for activation at 900 °C for 2 h under nitrogen atmosphere. The resultant black powder obtained was washed sequentially with 3 M HCl and 1000 mL warm water to eliminate all the inorganic impurities. The washed samples were then dried at 90 °C under vacuum in an oven for 15 h. Finally, the obtained materials were labeled as N or N, S-doped porous carbons (i.e., NPC-xyz or NSPC-xyz) where x, y, z denote mass ratios of carbonized sucrose, urea/thiourea, and K2CO3. For instance, NPC-113 means that the sample contain mass ratios of carbonized sucrose (x = 1), urea (y = 1), and K2CO3 (z = 3). Moreover, two non-doped samples denoted as PC-xz (i.e., PC-12, and PC-13) were prepared to explore the effect of K2CO3 on porosity generation and textural features."
4,Materials characterization,"2.3 Materials characterization Morphological analysis was achieved by FE-SEM (JSM 7600F JEOL, Japan) and TEM images (Transmission electron microscope, H-9500 (Hitachi) with a LaB6 electron-gun, 100–300 keV). The detailed information about crystallographic orientation and molecular interactions was realized by X-ray diffraction (D2 Phaser X-ray diffractometer, Bruker, Germany) and Raman spectroscopy (Horiba Raman Spectrometer with laser wavelength 532 nm). For surface chemistry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was performed by Scienta-Omicron system equipped with a micro-focused monochromatic Al K-alpha (1486.7 eV). Carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur contents of as-prepared sorbents were analyzed by an Elemental analyzer (Perkin Elmer). Further, to obtain nitrogen and H2 adsorption-desorption isotherms Micromeritics ASAP 2020 system was used. Lastly, to assess methylene blue adsorption, UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2550) was used."
5,Preparation of methylene blue (MB) dye solutions,"2.4 Preparation of methylene blue (MB) dye solutions MB dye solution in four distinct concentrations (50 mg/L, 100 mg/L, 150 mg/L, and 200 mg/L) was prepared by adding appropriate weighed amount of MB (dye) in deionized (DI) water, after which vigorous stirring was applied to obtain a uniform final product."
6,Methylene blue adsorption determination,"2.5 Methylene blue adsorption determination The adsorption ability of methylene blue was determined by the following relation (Eq. (1)). (1) qe = Co − Ce m × V t Here C 0 and Ce denotes initial and equilibrium concentrations for MB (mg/L), respectively, m represent the mass of prepared adsorbent (g) and V can be identified as volume of the solution (L). To study the adsorption kinetics, pseudo-first-order equation is used as shown below (Eq. (2)). (2) ln ( qe − qt ) / qe = − k 1 t where k 1 denote adsorption rate constant (1/min). The linear relationship was observed between plot of ln(qe−qt) vs t. The slope and intercept of this plot give values for k1 and qe, respectively. Further, the pseudo-second-order model is given below (Eq. (3)). (3) t q t = 1 / k 2 q e 2 + t q e where k 2 adsorption rate constant (g/mg min) for pseudo second order. The slope and intercept give qe and k 2 for the plot of t/qt against t."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Schematic and morphological analysis,"3.1 Schematic and morphological analysis The present work establishes a facile synthesis of series of heteroatom doped (N/N, S) microporous carbons using sucrose as a carbon precursor. Scheme 1 illustrates a two-step synthetic avenue involving carbonization as a first step followed by in-situ K2CO3 activation and heteroatom doping simultaneously as a second step (see synthetic protocol for details). All prepared carbons demonstrate high % yield ranging 41–63 (Table 2) calculated by the following relation (Eq. (4)). (4) % yield = mass of activated carbon massofprecarbonized char X 100 Further, to explore surface topology of as-prepared carbons, SEM analysis was performed, and corresponding micrographs are presented in ( Figs. 1 and S1). As depicted, N/N, S-doped carbons demonstrate highly porous morphology attributed to the combined effect of K2CO3 activation and successful surface modifications by heteroatoms dopants (urea/thiourea). Herein, thiourea-modified samples NSPC-112 (Fig. 1(c, d)) and NSPC-113 (Fig. 1(g, h)) demonstrate similar sponge-like highly interconnected morphology revealing the effective role of thiourea in interconnected porous network formation [48] . Interestingly, in case of NSPC-113, somewhat larger pores were observed. Further, samples NPC-113 (Fig. 1(e, f)) and NPC-112 (Fig. S1(b)) demonstrates sheet like morphology with clear pores formation spread over whole samples [49] . These samples illustrate the highest % yield (Table 2) and highly porous carbon skeleton attributed to beneficial role of urea in porosity generation. In brief, urea/thiourea play a simultaneous role of structure guiding agent, porosity generation, and heteroatom dopant thereby, enhancing the porosity in these carbons [50,51]. On contrary, non-doped samples PC-12 (Fig. 1(a, b)) and PC-13 (Fig. S1(a)) did not show significant porosity rather demonstrate thick graphitic sheet like morphology. To further explicate the porous nature of synthesized materials, HR-TEM images were obtained for sample NPC-113 (Fig. S2). From the TEM images, highly disordered sheet like morphology is evident with worm-shaped pores [52] . In brief, SEM and TEM micrographs reveal a highly amorphous carbon framework with uniformly dispersed pores."
9,Structural analysis,"3.2 Structural analysis To evaluate crystalline structure of as-synthesized carbons, XRD and Raman spectroscopy were employed with corresponding results depicted in Fig. 2(a, b). The XRD patterns reveal two prominent peaks for all samples corresponding to 2θ ≈ 24° and 43°, suggesting the prepared carbons possess graphitic nature. The first peak at 2θ ≈ 24° indexed as (002) plane and represents reflection from graphitic lattice [53] . The second less intense peak at 2θ ≈ 43o is correlated to superposition of two reflection planes (100), (101) and demonstrates limited graphitic structure [54] . Interestingly, carbons prepared with single- or dual (N, S)-doping indicates less intense diffraction peaks with more amorphous structure substantiating the role of dopant in enhancing porous and disordered structure of as-prepared carbons. Furthermore, no K2CO3 peak was observed in XRD patterns revealing the complete elimination of potassium metal through acid washing. To further illustrate the crystallographic structure of as-prepared carbons, Raman analysis was carried out with results demonstrated in (Fig. 2(b)). The two prominent peaks appeared at ~1340 cm-1 and 1580 cm-1 denoted as D and G bands, respectively. The G-band signifies the graphitic nature of prepared carbons and is originated from sp2-bonded carbon vibrations associated with E2g phonons in tangential direction contained by a 2D hexagonal lattice [55] . In contrast, D-band located at 1340 cm-1 stem from A1g symmetry associated with lattice vibrations of terminal carbons and demonstrate the presence of disordered microstructure and crystalline defects [56] . To estimate the degree of structural defects in prepared carbons, the relative intensity of both D and G bands (ID/IG) were determined and the calculated values ranges from 1.012 to 1.032 indicating significant amount of crystal defects in all samples with the highest values observed for samples with N/N-S doping (NPC-113 and NSPC-113), consistent to XRD results. Moreover, a high content of heteroatoms suggests abundant defects particularly, a large magnitude of basic nitrogen implies highly disordered structures with high defect density (D-band peak) attributed to its location at defect or edge sites. Interestingly, Haghseresht et al. [57] , proposed a relation between I D /I G ratio, surface area, micropore volume, and adsorption capacities. In our study, we also have observed an increasing trend of I D /I G ratio of PC-12 < PC-13 < NSPC-112 < NPC-112 < NSPC-113 < NPC-113, similar to trend observed for pore volume (detail in next section). Summarizing, NPC-113 with I D /I G = 1.032 demonstrates an abundance of highly defective and disordered structure concurrent with highly porous carbon framework and large pore volume, a criterion for effective gas and dye adsorption."
10,Pore generation and textural features,"3.3 Pore generation and textural features The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribution (PSD) are presented in Fig. 2(c, d). Noteworthy, the isotherm curves rose sharply at low pressure (~0.01 bar) with transformation into a plateau at elevated pressure revealing the presence of narrow micropores and mesopores, respectively. Such isotherm shape is classified as type I, according to IUPAC system [58]. Moreover, no significant rise in N2 adsorption at higher pressure indicate the absence of abundant pores to further capture N2 gas molecules. Moving forward, the PSDs for all prepared carbons are presented in Fig. 2(d). All samples exhibit diverse range of micro-meso pores. The sharp PSD positioned at 0.7 nm, and 1.4 nm for almost all samples indicate substantial amount of available micropores which provide abundant active sites for gas and dye adsorption [59]. Additionally, subsequent mesopores peak positioned ~ 3 nm particularly for samples NPC-113, and NSPC-113 further illustrate the importance of mesopores for ion transport, and mass diffusion as these samples demonstrate highest H2 gas adsorption and MB dye adsorption (see next sections). The micropores adsorb gas and dye molecules whereas mesopores provide the path for mass transport thus, optimum micro-mesopores content is a prerequisite for efficient gas and dye adsorption [60]. The detailed textural features e.g., SSA and pore volume are presented in Table 1. The SSA, calculated by the BET method at P/P 0 = 0.04–0.32, for PC-12, PC-13, NSPC-112, NPC-112, NSPC-113, and NPC-113 are 1645 m2 g-1, 1838 m2 g-1, 2190 m2 g-1, 2211 m2 g-1, 2542 m2 g-1, and 2842 m2 g-1, respectively. The higher SSA of NSPC-113, and NPC-113 is attributed to the complete consumption of urea/thiourea during carbonization/activation process. More specifically, K2CO3 may facilitate heteroatom infiltration in carbon skeleton which eventually leads to carbon expanded structure. Meanwhile, the interaction of urea/thiourea with surface functional groups (for instance, -OH and -COOH) of sucrose-derived carbon through hydrogen bonding leads to an impression that these organic compounds also behave as activating agents and produce high SSA combined with precise porous network during activation [53]."
11,Surface analysis,"3.4 Surface analysis To estimate the chemical composition and surface chemistry of as-prepared materials, chemical elemental analysis and XPS results are obtained in ( Figs. 3 and S3) and Table S1. From the XPS survey scan, it is evident that all the prepared materials exhibit carbonaceous nature with moderately high N (0.8–4.1 at%), S (0.5–2.1 at%), and O (3.2–4.7 at%) contents. Noteworthy, N and S were intentionally induced by urea and thiourea modifications, however, O containing groups arise from remnants of sucrose and oxidizing environment of activation [14] . In addition, the elemental analysis reveal that the bulk material comprises of carbon (89.2–93.9 wt%), oxygen (3.0–4.0 wt%), nitrogen (0.7–3.7 wt%), and sulfur (0.4–1.8 wt%). The results of elemental analysis are in good agreement with the XPS results which signifies the comparable surface and bulk elemental composition. To qualitatively investigate the types of surficial functional groups, C 1s, N 1s, and S 2p XPS spectra were further deconvoluted into distinct peaks. In C 1s spectra, all the prepared adsorbents exhibit an intense peak ~284 eV attributed to the abundance of sp2 aromatic carbons. Meanwhile, towards higher binding energy peak broadening appears which give rise to more peaks in the region of 285–290 eV, denoted as C-N, C-S, CO, and COOH functional groups. Here, the oxygen containing functionalities are ascribed as alcohol, phenol, ether, carbonyl, ketene, and carboxylic acids [61] . Moving forward, in urea/thiourea modified samples, N 1s peak was further deconvoluted into four distinct nitrogen forms named as pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, graphitic-N, and oxidized-N with the binding energies of ~397.8, 399.9, 401.2, 402.5 eV. In the literature, it is well-explored that pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen groups are bonded to the conjugated carbon rings and thereby induce basic character by donating π-electrons to the aromatic carbon framework. Therefore, presence of basic nitrogen (pyridinic and pyrrolic) is highly favorable in cationic methylene blue adsorption by generating Lewis acid-basic interactions [62] . Herein, samples NPC-113 and NSPC-113 exhibit highest cumulative pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen content (~69.6%), proclaiming them as a promising candidate for MB adsorption. Moreover, the presence of moderately high sulfur content further enhanced the surface heterogeneity of as-prepared samples. In NSPC-113 and NSPC-112, S 2p peak was deconvoluted into four distinct peaks labelled as C-S-C (2p 3/2), C-S-C (2p 1/2), -C-SOx-C- (2p 3/2), and -C-SOx-C- (2p 1/2) in the region of 163–170 eV. For sample, NSPC-113 a high content of oxidized-S (53.9% for -C-SOx-C- (2p 3/2), and 31.2% for -C-SOx-C- (2p 1/2)) is evident which also imparts a basic character to the carbon framework thereby playing a beneficial role in cationic dye adsorption. In conclusion, the enriched surface chemistry of as-prepared samples reveals the abundance of basic functional groups in NPC-113 and NSPC-113 consequently expecting them as efficient dye adsorbents."
12,Methylene blue adsorption,"3.5 Methylene blue adsorption To investigate the potential of the as-prepared materials for multidimensional applications, an organic dye adsorption experiment was conducted in an aqueous medium. Four different solutions of methylene blue, a cationic dye, at various concentrations ranging from 50 to 200 mg/L was prepared. All prepared materials were tested as adsorbents using an initial concentration of 50 mg/L and the adsorption equilibrium time was determined by UV–vis spectra. The best performing sample, NPC-113, exhibits a rapid decrease in the intensity of the absorption peaks with time, as shown in Fig. 4(a), revealing a substantial rise in the amount of dye adsorbed. After 50 min, no considerable increase in adsorption capacity was observed, thereby we optimize the equilibrium time to 60 min. Moreover, the corresponding equilibrium adsorption value (q e) of 95.12 mg/g was recorded for NPC-113 at 50 mg/L of MB Fig. 4(b), following an increasing trend PC-12 < PC-13 < NSPC-112 < NPC-112 < NSPC-113 < NPC-113, similar to trend for mesopore volume (Table 1). Additionally, it is evident that a rapid rise in adsorption occurs during the initial stages, which signifies that dye adsorption is more favorable at vacant adsorbent surface sites. Gradually, the dye uptake slows down with time, which is ascribed to the slow diffusion of MB molecules in the pores and capillary sites of the adsorbents [63]. To access the working performance of dye adsorbents, regeneration ability is necessary to investigate. In the literature, different desorption media such as HCl, H2SO4, NaOH, ethanol, and deionized (DI) water, are reported for sorbent recovery [64–66]. Herein, we regenerated NPC-113 by washing with ethanol and hot DI water several times followed by drying in vacuum oven for 12 h. Fig. S4 reveals 79.7% and 65.9% recovery efficiency and MB removal rate, respectively, after four cycles. Therefore, the excellent regeneration ability declared our prepared sorbents as promising candidates for efficient MB removal. 3.5.1 Adsorption kinetics In this study, kinetic modeling was performed to determine the reaction order. Two linear plots, ln(qe− qt) vs. t and t/qt vs. t, labeled as pseudo-first order and pseudo-second-order models, respectively, are displayed in Fig. 4(c, d). The highest determination coefficient (R2 = 0.9998) was observed for the pseudo-second-order model and the obtained qe value is in accordance with the experimentally determined value ( Table 3). Hence, it can be concluded that MB adsorption on the as-prepared carbons follows pseudo-second-order kinetics [67]. 3.5.2 Effect of initial dye concentration To examine the effect of MB initial concentration on the quantity adsorbed, the adsorption capacities of all prepared samples, at equilibrium time, were determined and plotted in Fig. 5 and summarized in Table 2. It is obvious that increasing the concentration of MB from 50 to 200 mg/L drastically enhanced the adsorbed quantity from 95.12 to 398.09 mg/g. The table comparing dye adsorption performance with recently reported literature is given in the Supplementary information (Table S2). 3.5.3 Continuous flow dye filtration To estimate the immediate adsorption potential of NPC-113, continuous flow dye filtration experiment was designed, as shown in Fig. 6. In the assembly of experiment, adsorbent bed of 200 mg of NPC-113 was made on cellulose ester membrane filter (pore size: 200 nm, diameter: 47 mm). The simulated wastewater containing 50 mg/L of MB was poured on the adsorbent bed and was continuously filtered using vacuum aspirator. Interestingly, the residual concentration of MB in filtrate was reduced to 10 mg/L after first cycle of filtration. Moreover, after three cycles 97.6% of MB was removed from wastewater revealing the highly efficient and fast adsorption potential of NPC-113 adsorptive bed. Considering the economic viability, fast and facile nature of experiment, the prepared adsorbent is a promising candidate for wastewater remediation on industrial scale. 3.5.4 Adsorption mechanism The mechanism for MB adsorption includes the initial transfer of cationic dye molecules from aqueous solution to adsorbent surfaces, where surface-functional groups act as anchoring sites, followed by slow diffusion of dye molecules to the pores of the adsorbents [63] . To explore the role of porosity for efficient MB adsorption, the dimensional size of methylene blue (1.43 nm × 0.61 nm × 0.4 nm) must be considered. Materials possessing well-defined micropores (<2 nm) with optimum mesopores (<5 nm) are generally considered as promising candidates for MB adsorption [68] . Here, NPC-113 exhibits a hierarchical micro-mesoporous structure with ample micropores (1.34 cm3/g) and mesopores (2.94 cm3/g). The presence of mesopores facilitates the diffusion of dye molecules to deep-lying micropores and heterogeneous active sites throughout the carbon framework (Scheme 1). Considering the surface heterogeneity of the as-prepared adsorbents, the abundance of oxygen-groups (phenolic, carboxylic, and oxidized sulfur) and nitrogen functionalities (pyridinic and pyrrolic-N) is one of the beneficial attributes for dye adsorption [69] . Meanwhile, MB possess organic ammonium cations where N+ exhibits the affinity to accept electrons and can act as a Lewis acid. Therefore, Lewis acid-base interactions generated between the MB and basic adsorbent surfaces contribute positively to the maximum dye adsorption capacity. Furthermore, MB possesses an aromatic ring structure with delocalized π-electrons and our prepared samples exhibit a π-electron-enriched graphitic structure [70] . Therefore, the π-π interaction between the adsorbents and MB molecules further facilitates the adsorption of dye molecules on adsorbent surfaces. Here, NPC-113 exhibits the highest quantity of adsorbed dye ~398.09 mg/g, at all the dye concentrations, due to its high heteroatom content along with excellent textural features. On the other hand, the non-doped carbons (PC-12 and PC-13) also exhibit moderate dye adsorption up to 353.3 mg/g attributed to the well-defined hierarchical micro-meso porous structure despite of heteroatom deprived surfaces. Therefore, the as-prepared carbons exhibit predominantly physical adsorption via pore filling mechanism in collaboration to Lewis acid-base and electrostatic interactions due to heteroatom-enriched active sites, which cumulatively leads to effective removal of dye from aqueous solutions."
13,H2 storage,"3.6 H2 storage Furthermore, regarding low-pressure vehicular cryo-adsorption, our prepared materials were investigated for H2 storage at cryogenic conditions (77 and 87 K) and 1 bar. Fig. 7(a, b) illustrate completely reversible adsorption-desorption isotherms and Table 2 lists the H2 uptakes of individual samples at the two different temperatures, comparable to the previous reports (Table S3). The highest H2 uptake by NPC-113 (2.21 wt%) and NSPC-113 (2.01 wt%) is attributed to the presence of well-defined ultra-micropores in the region of 0.6–0.9 nm, as evident by NLDFT pore size. However, as the pore size increases (> 0.9 nm) in PC-13 and PC-12, the H2 uptake considerably decreases up to 0.59 wt%. For a better understanding, micropore volume for different micropore sizes (0.68, 0.84, and 1 nm) were plotted against H2 uptake capacity (wt%) at 77 K and 1 bar using a linear equation (Fig. 7(c-e)). From the results, samples with a high micropore volume (0.68 nm) exhibit excellent linear fitting, with the highest regression coefficient (R2 = 0.90146), thereby illustrating the role of narrow micropores (~0.68 nm) for efficient H2 uptake. Our findings are consistent with the reported results demonstrating narrow pores as a key factor to induce strong adsorbent-H2 interactions, which are generated by the overlapping potential fields of neighboring pore walls [71] . Gogotsi et al. [47] demonstrated the influence of pore size, shape, and degree of disorder on H2 uptake. They reported that increasing pore size will reduce carbon-H2 interactions, which ultimately leads to reduced H2 uptake. Furthermore, Garcia Blanco et al. [72] presented theoretical studies suggesting that the heats of H2 adsorption decrease with increasing pore sizes at any pressure. Thus, it is inferred that the presence of narrow micropores plays a dominant role in efficient H2 adsorption. In brief, it can be concluded that gas-gas interactions contribute actively to smaller micropores where an optimum compact adsorbate structure is generated. Moreover, heteroatoms show no prominent role in enhancing H2 uptake, which is consistent with previous reports [73,74] and, consequently, demonstrates the importance of narrow micropores (<0.68 nm) for efficient H2 adsorption at 1 bar and cryogenic conditions. To estimate the binding strength between hydrogen molecules and adsorbent surface, isosteric heats of adsorption (Q st) were determined for three representative samples at 77 and 87 K, using the Clausius–Clapeyron equation. A plot of Q st as a function of H2 uptake (wt%) is shown in Fig. S5. All the three samples exhibit high initial Q st values (5.69–7.02 kJ/mol) at nearly zero H2 coverage which decreases to (4.49–5.41 kJ/mol) at 1.4 wt% hydrogen uptake. The high Q st of present work is ascribed to the well-developed microporous framework, which is comparable to the microporous carbons, zeolite-templated carbons and carbide-derived carbon reported in the literature [47,75–77]. Furthermore, the optimized sample, NPC-113, exhibiting the highest H2 uptake was further subjected to cyclic stability test at 77 K and 1 bar and the adsorption-desorption cycles were repeated for five times. From the Fig. S6, it is evident that the desorption curve follows similar path to the adsorption curves revealing a complete reversible hydrogen storage performance. Moreover, no significant loss in H2 uptake capacity was observed after five cycles. Therefore, it can be asserted that the prepared adsorbents can be utilized as promising hydrogen storage materials."
14,Conclusions,"In summary, a series of heteroatom (N, S)-doped hierarchical porous carbons have been prepared and later inspected for potential applications of MB and H2 adsorption. As-prepared NPC-113 demonstrate high SSA (2842 m2/g), pore volume (1.35 cm3/g), optimum nitrogen content (1.9 at%), and uniformly generated porous framework which offer significant adsorption space and basic active sites for cationic MB adsorption. Additionally, the adsorption process was modeled with pseudo-second order kinetics and demonstrate an excellent MB adsorption up to 398.09 mg/g at initial dye concentration of 200 mg/L, surpassing most of the reported literature. Moreover, for practical application of wastewater treatment, continuous flow dye filtration experiment was carried out which exhibit remarkably ultrafast and high MB removal efficiency up to 97.6%, attributed to the well-defined hierarchical micro-mesoporous structure which trap dye molecules. In addition, the surface heterogeneity further enhances the adsorption performance by generating electrostatic interactions between electron-rich heteroatom sites/π-electron domains of microporous carbon with cationic center of methylene blue. Lastly, an excellent H2 uptake, ~2.21 wt%, was observed for NPC-113 owing to the presence of narrow micropores (<0.68 nm). Therefore, NPC-113 is an unprecedently efficient adsorbent for MB removal from wastewater and H2 storage and thereby, our study offers a facile synthetic approach for multifunctional material in harvesting industrial applications."
