0,Introduction,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is one of the most versatile chemicals and has been widely used in various industries [1–3]. For example, H2O2 is viewed as a promising candidate for water treatment and disinfectants for the hospital on account of its high oxidizable character at low cost [4,5]. Besides, according to its remarkable ability to bleach, the current main application of H2O2 involves the paper and pulp industry [6,7]. However, the traditional industrial process for the synthesis of H2O2 involves an energy-intensive anthraquinone process, which requires large-scale infrastructure and a series of intricate steps, including hydrogenation and oxidation steps in an organic solvent, followed by extraction and further distillation process [8,9]. Currently, the synthesis of H2O2 through the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has attracted great attention [10]. In general, compared to the well-stablished anthraquinone process, the H2O2 with lower concentration was obtained from the ORR, which needs to further concentrate to use. However, the decentralized and small-scaled electrochemical production of H2O2 can be coupled with renewable energy sources and thus can be directly used in the remote regions, which will reduce the cost of storage and transportation of H2O2 [11,12]. Typically, electrochemical ORR can proceed through two reaction routes [13,14]. On the one hand, O2 can be reduced to H2O through the 4e− reduction process, which has gained a vital position in fuel cell applications [15,16]. One the other hand, H2O2 can be generated by the 2e− reduction process [17]. For the 2e− ORR, oxygen and water were consumed as the reactants, and only the hydroxyl generated as the byproduct in alkaline solutions. Moreover, the two-electron ORR method for H2O2 electrosynthesis possesses better safety and convenient operation at mild conditions than the current anthraquinone process [18,19]. Though, the H2O2 product has typically been generated in a mixture, with solutes in traditional liquid electrolytes ranging from acidic to alkaline pH, it can also be used in different domains. Therefore, compared to the traditional anthraquinone process, the electrochemical synthesis may afford an additional promising approach to generate H2O2, especially for the small plants based on the electrosynthesis of H2O2. Recently, carbon-based materials have been received increasing attention for generating H2O2 via ORR due to their earth-abundance [20,21], easily tunable electronic structure and stability under reaction conditions [22–26]. However, the pristine carbons are inactive as electrocatalysts [27], so it is vital to make defective sites for activating carbon materials [28,29]. Though carbon-based materials show potentials for 2e− ORR, the ambiguous structure-activity relationships inhibit the elaborate design for more efficient catalysts [30]. Besides, noble metals and their alloys such as Au-Pt-Ni [31], Au-Pd [32], Pt-Hg [33], and Pd-Hg [34] nanoparticles have been reported to possess excellent catalytic activity and selectivity toward H2O2 with well-defined structure-activity relationships. However, their applications are impeded from the earth-scarcity of precious metals or high toxicity of Hg. Thus, exploring effective, nontoxic, and low-cost catalysts and understanding the relationship between structure and activity are urgent for the 2e- ORR process. In this work, Ni3B is identified as an active, selective, and stable catalyst for 2e- ORR to generate H2O2. The Ni3B electrocatalyst exhibits a high selectivity of over 90 % toward H2O2 production, and can stably generate H2O2 for 10 h, reaching accumulated H2O2 concentration of 11.9 mg L-1. In addition, our experimental results further demonstrate that the improved ORR performance for H2O2 production resulted from Ni and B alloying process. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the inner B atoms with high electronegativity decrease the state density of Ni-3d orbital near the Fermi level relative to elemental Ni, which optimizes the binding energy of OOH* and makes Ni3B a highly efficient and stable catalyst for ORR via the two-electron pathway."
1,Experiment,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Nickel (II) chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O), KBH4, NaOH, N2H4·H2O, and ethanol were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent. Tetraethylene glycol (TEG, 99 %) and Na2S2O3 were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Boron powder was purchased from Aladdin. Starch and K3[Fe(CN)6] were obtained from Macklin."
3,Synthesis of Ni3B nanoparticles,"2.2 Synthesis of Ni3B nanoparticles The synthetic process of Ni3B referred to the reported literature with some modifications [35]. In detail, 160 mg of nickel chloride and 15 mL of TEG were added into the 150 mL Round-bottom flask. The solution was sonicated for 10 min until most of the salts were dissolved and then allowed to stir and heat to 60 °C on an oil bath pan while purging with Ar all the time. Next, 15 mL of TEG with 500 mg of KBH4 was added to the metal salt solution within 1 min. The color of the solution quickly turned black. The temperature was slowly warmed up to 270 °C and maintained for 10 min with continuous stirring under an Ar purge. Lastly, after being naturally cooled down, the product was collected by centrifugation with ethanol for several times."
4,Synthesis of Ni nanoparticles,"2.3 Synthesis of Ni nanoparticles The solution A was prepared by making 4 g of NiCl2·6H2O dissolved into 15 mL of ethanol. Then, 5 g of N2H4·H2O (80 wt%) was mixed with 20 mL distilled water containing 10 g of NaOH to form solution B. Finally, solution B was added dropwise to solution A with continuous stirring, and the stirring process was continued for several hours until no more bubbles were released at room temperature. The products were washed with distilled water till pH ∼7, and then reserved in alcohol."
5,Synthesis of Ni-B alloy samples with different alloying degree,"2.4 Synthesis of Ni-B alloy samples with different alloying degree First, we mechanically mixed nickel nanoparticles obtained before and boron powders with the molar ratio of 3:1 and ground it in mortar for half an hour. Then, the Ni + B-600, Ni + B-800, Ni + B-1000 samples were prepared via annealing the mixture at 600 °C, 800 °C, 1000 °C for 30 min under the atmosphere of Ar, respectively."
6,Materials characterization,2.5 Materials characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on the Bruker D8ADVANCE powder diffractometer with Cu Kα X-ray radiation. The morphology information of the sample was characterized by scanning electron transmission microscopy (SEM) images obtained on a Hitachi S-4800 microscope with an Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (FEI Tecnai G2 F20). The high-resolution STEM and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were carried out on FEI Tecnai G2 F20. The chemical environment of the samples was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Thermo ESCALAB 250XI).
7,Electrochemical measurements,"2.6 Electrochemical measurements The rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) setup (BAS Inc, Japan) with an electrochemical station (CHI 750E) was used to test the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance of the catalyst. A three-electrode system was applied with an RRDE (glassy carbon (GC) disk, d =5 mm, and Pt ring), a Hg/HgO reference electrode, and a graphite rod counter electrode. Besides, the single compartment electrolyzer was used in our experiment, and the electrolyte was alkaline solutions containing 0.1 M KOH. Before being used, the RRDE was polished mechanically with 0.5 μm and 0.05 μm alumina slurry and rinsed generously with deionized water several times. The catalyst ink was prepared by mixing 1 mg Ni3B, 0.2 mg XC-72 carbon black, 750 μL of ethanol, 50 μL of DI water, and 20 μL Nafion (5%) and ultra-sonicating for half an hour to form homogeneous ink. Then, 10 μL of the catalyst ink was dropped on the glassy carbon disk and left to dry for one hour at room temperature. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed between 0 and 0.9 V versus RHE in N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 for 20 cycles, in which a steady CV response was obtained. The electrolyte was subsequently purged with O2 for 30 min, and then linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at the scan rate of 10 mV s−1 with 1600 rpm was performed for the ORR tests. All the potentials were reported concerning a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in this paper, which was adapted from the Hg/HgO electrode using E(RHE) = E(Hg/HgO) + 0.165 V + 0.059×pH, except for specially mentioned. The oxygen reduction polarization currents were obtained without any iR-compensation but corrected by subtracting the capacitive background current. During the LSV, the Pt ring potential was held at 1.3 V versus RHE. The electron transfer number and H2O2 selectivity were calculated using the following relations (1), (2), respectively. (1) n = 4 I d I d + I r / N (2) H O 2 - % = 200 × I r / N I d + I r / N Where Id is the disk current, Ir is the ring current, and N is the collection efficiency. The [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− redox system was used to determine the collection efficiency (N). The RRDE electrode with electrocatalyst was soaked in N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH +2 mM K3[Fe(CN)6], and then chronoamperometry was performed at −0.3 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) with the ring potential set as 0.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) for 60 s. Similarly, the background response was also obtained, but the applied disk potential was adjusted to 0.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Finally, the calculated collection efficiency is 0.39 (Fig. S3)."
8,Iodometric titration,"2.7 Iodometric titration To measure the yield of H2O2, iodometric titration was performed. In detail, 2 mL of the analyte obtained after the chronoamperometry test and 0.1 mL of 1 M H2SO4 were added to 10 mL glass vial. Then 2.0 mL of 2 % KI and 1 mL of molybdate solution (12 g of NH4NO3, 1.5 mL of ammonia solution, and 4.5 g of (NH4)6Mo7O2·4H2O dissolved to 100 mL) were added resulting in a color change to yellowish brown, which suggesting the formation of I2. Lastly, 1 mL of 1% starch were added and the solution rapidly turned dark purple. The practical H2O2 was completed by titrated with a standard Na2S2O3 (0.01 M) until the dark purple color completely disappears and the yield of H2O2 was calculated by following reaction: E x p e r i m e n t a l Y i e l d = 0.01 × V ( N a 2 S 2 O 3 ) 2"
9,DFT simulations,"2.8 DFT simulations All calculations are based on density functional theory (DFT) by using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [36] with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerh (PBE) function for describing the interaction between the electrons [37,38]. The projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials were adopted. Cut-off energy for the plane-wave is set to be 550 eV. And the convergence criteria are set to be 10−4 eV and 0.05 eV/Å for energy and force, respectively. The surfaces on Ni (111) and Ni3B (031) are simulated with five packed layers of atoms. There into, the three bottom layers keep ﬁxed. The interaction of periodically repeated slabs is avoided by setting the vacuum space of 20A˚ The Brillouin zone is sampled with 4 × 4×1 and 2 × 2×1 k-points grids for the supercells of Ni (111) and Ni3B (031), respectively [39]. The performance of ORR is evaluated by the reaction free energy (ΔG) of each elementary step using: ΔG = ΔE + ΔE ZPE – TΔS – eU where ΔE is the adsorption energy from DFT calculations, ΔE ZPE, and ΔS is the change in zero-point energy and the entropy, T is the temperature (T =298.15 K), e and U are the number of electrons transferred and the applied electrode potential for one-electron reactions."
10,Results and discussion,"Crystalline nickel boride (Ni3B) was synthesized directly via the solvothermal method. KBH4 was used both as a boron source and a reducing agent for Ni2+, while TEG serves as a solvent able to achieve a reaction temperature for crystallizing Ni3B. The morphologies of Ni3B were then investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 1 a, Ni3B shows the uniform nanoparticles (NPs) with a mean diameter of ∼60 nm. The low-magnification TEM image (Fig. 1b) demonstrates that these NPs consist of smaller NPs with a mean size of ∼10 nm, which were further confirmed by High-magnification TEM image (Fig. 1c and d). The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern displays that the diffraction ring composed of discrete points, indicating the crystalline character of Ni3B. Besides, the lattice distance of 0.197 nm, 0.206 nm, 0.224 nm, and 0.199 nm in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1d) are well consistent with the interplanar spacing of the (031), (220), (201), and (102) crystallographic planes of Ni3B. The energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) (Fig. S1) further reflects that these NPs consist of Ni and B elements, and the molar ratio of Ni versus B is closed to 3:1. Moreover, the corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) element mapping (Fig. 1e) shows that Ni and B are homogeneously distributed. Afterward, structural characterization of the as-prepared samples was performed, and the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the as-prepared Ni3B is shown in Fig. 2 a, which can be assigned to the standard card of Ni3B (JCPD NO.82-1699) [35,40]. It is generally accepted that the electrocatalytic performance of a catalyst depends on its surface composition and chemical state. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyze the chemical composition and valence state of Ni3B, and the XPS survey spectrum of Ni3B NPs was provided in Fig. S2. As shown in Fig. 2b, the Ni 2 P peaks at 852.1 eV and 869.6 eV are ascribed to metallic Ni° originated from Ni3B, which exhibits a positive shift about 0.6 eV compared to the pure Ni NPs [41]. The B 1 s spectra of Ni3B shows one distinct peak (Fig. 2c) at about 187.3 eV, which can be assigned to the B signal in Ni3B, and a negative shift about 0.3 eV occurs in comparison to pure B (Fig. S12). The XPS analysis of Ni 2p and B 1 s not only shows the characters of Ni-B alloy but also exhibit strong electron interactions between Ni and B. In addition, the quantitative analysis of the Ni/B atomic ratios on the sample surface is exhibited in Fig. 2d. The Ni/B atomic ratio is closed to 3:1, which is consistent with the EDS composition analysis mentioned above, confirming that the as-prepared sample is Ni3B. The electrochemical activity of Ni3B NPs for oxygen reduction reaction toward hydrogen peroxide production in basic solutions (0.1 M KOH) was studied using the rotating ring disc electrode (RRDE) technique, and the details of the test were shown in experimental part. Fig. 3 a shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) profiles of the Ni3B electrocatalyst with the scan rate of 10 mV s−1, including the disk current density and ring current. The onset potentials at the disk and ring electrodes are both located at ∼0.7 V versus RHE, and the high activity to afford an ORR potential at 1 mA cm-2 is 0.52 V versus RHE, demonstrating an excellent oxygen reduction activity of Ni3B. Fig. 3b shows the average electron transfer number (n) for Ni3B, which was calculated to be ∼2.05 at the potential range of 0.1−0.55 V versus RHE, suggesting a dominant two-electron oxygen reduction pathway. The selectivity of H2O2 production over Ni3B nanoparticles is around 90 % (the Faradic efficiency of H2O2 is around 80–90 %) at the potential range of 0.1 to 0.55 V versus RHE (Fig. 3c), comparable or even superior to many other reported electrocatalysts (Table S1). Both the electron transfer number and selectivity of Ni3B indicate that a high-selective 2e- ORR process was achieved. Furthermore, the stability of the electrocatalysts is essential for producing H2O2. The long-time stability of Ni3B, shown in Fig. 3d, was measured via chronoamperometry at 0.7 mA cm-2. The negligible changes in activity indicate the structural stability of Ni3B under working conditions for robust electrochemical production. Besides, the structural character of Ni3B NPs obtained after durability test were investigated by XPS and TEM. As shown in Fig. S4, the peak at 187.5 eV of B 1 s and the peak at 852.3 eV of Ni 2p exhibit the character of Ni-B bond. The morphologies and structure of Ni3B after catalysis reaction were further investigated by TEM. As shown in Fig. S5 (in the red region), the Ni3B NPs remain the morphology of nanoparticle and the HRTEM image further shows the clear lattice stripes characters of Ni3B NPs. All these results indicate that Ni3B NPs shows excellent durability under ORR process. To further demonstrate the selective H2O2 production, the iodometric determination of H2O2 over Ni3B NPs was carried out, and the color of the solution turn blue in the process of iodometric titration. If all the reduction current results in the production of H2O2, the theoretical concentration of H2O2 operated at 0.7 mA cm-2 for 10 h was calculated to be 13.11 mg L−1, while the actual measured H2O2 concentration by iodometric determination is about 11.9 mg L−1. Considering that the H2O2 selectivity of Ni3B is 90 % and little partial H2O2 decomposed in alkaline solutions, the result obtained from iodometric determination is reasonable. Importantly, Ni3B possesses a high mass activity of 16.5 A g−1 at 0.52 V versus RHE, which is even comparable to the noble-metal catalyst Pt-Hg (22 A g -1 noble metal at 0.65 V versus RHE) and Au-Pt-Ni (31.7 A g−1 catalyst at 0.55 V versus RHE). All these results demonstrate that the Ni3B NPs with high activity, selectivity, and stability is expected to be a promising electrocatalyst for H2O2 electrosynthesis. In order to study the reason why Ni3B possesses highly efficient 2e− ORR performance, the ORR results of pure Ni NPs and B powders were also obtained. Fig. S6 and S7 shows that the as-prepared Ni NPs possess uniform nanospheres with a diameter of ∼60 nm. The XPS spectra (Fig. S8) of Ni 2p peaks at 851.5 eV and 869.1 eV are ascribed to metallic Ni° of Ni NPs, which is ∼0.6 eV lower than that of Ni3B. The selectivity toward H2O2 of Ni NPs was 35–40 % (Fig. S9), which is comparable to the previous report [42,43], suggesting that the pure Ni is not suitable for the 2e− ORR process. The XRD pattern of B powder shown in Fig. S10 can be assigned to B (JCPD No. 85-409). SEM images and the corresponding SEM-mapping of B powder were shown in Fig. S11, indicating the uniform distribution of B element. Besides, the XPS analysis was also applied for B powder (Fig. S12). The dominating peak at 187.6 eV can be ascribed to the BB bonding in B powder, which is 0.3 eV higher than that of Ni3B. A little peak at 192.7 eV is related to BO bonding in B2O3, which may result from the partial oxidation of B powder in air [44,45]. The H2O2 selectivity of B powder is around 80 % (Fig. S13). However, the activity is very poor compared to Ni3B. Even when the potential was applied to 0 V versus RHE, the current density of B sample is still lower than 1 mA cm-2. In addition, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) test of Ni3B NPs, Ni and B powder was investigated in 0.1 M KOH saturated with N2 and O2, respectively. As shown in Fig. S14, the CV for all samples shows similar profiles in N2-saturated electrolyte, and there are no redox peaks, which indicates no changes occurred for all electrocatalysts at the potential range of 0−0.9 V. In O2-saturated electrolyte, Ni3B shows better performance than Ni and B powder. To have a more straightforward view of the performance difference among B, Ni, and Ni3B, the ring current and H2O2 selectivity of the three samples were compared in Fig. S15. It shows that the ring current of Ni3B at 0.3 V versus RHE is 3.x and 8.x times higher than that of Ni and B, respectively, indicating that the high activity and selectivity of Ni3B can be ascribed to the synergistic effect between Ni and B on account of the strong polarization of Ni-B bonds. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of Ni3B NPs is 11.24 m2/g, which is higher than the value of 2.64 for Ni, shown in Fig. S16. Furthermore, the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) of Ni3B and Ni was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S17), which is generally proportional to the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). The Cdl of Ni3B is about 0.326 m F/cm2, larger than that of Ni (0.052 m F/cm2), which is beneficial for ORR performance. To verify the hypothesis that the synergistic effect between Ni and B resulted in the high performance and selectivity toward H2O2 production, the Ni-B alloy with different alloying degree were synthesized by controlling the annealing temperature. Fig. 4 a shows the XRD patterns of Ni and B mixture (3:1), Ni and B mixture heated at 600 °C (denoted as Ni + B-600 °C), Ni and B mixture heated at 800 °C (denoted as Ni + B-800 °C), and Ni and B mixture heated at 1000 °C (denoted as Ni + B-1000 °C). The partial magnified XRD patterns of the Ni + B-600 °C, Ni + B-800 °C, and Ni + B-1000 °C were shown in Fig. 4b, which exhibits that the Ni3B formed as the temperature increased to 800 °C. The formation of Ni3B indicates that a strong interaction between Ni and B occurs. Moreover, the amount of Ni3B increased as increasing the annealing temperature. The SEM image (Fig. S18a) and the corresponding elemental mapping (Fig. S18b) of Ni + B mixture confirm that Ni and B are well mixed. As the annealing temperature increase from 600 °C to 800 °C, micron-crystals gradually occurred (Fig. S19), suggesting the formation of Ni3B. Fig. 4c shows the ORR performance of Ni + B mixture, Ni + B-600 °C, Ni + B-800 °C, and Ni + B-1000 °C, and the average electron transfer number, H2O2 selectivity were shown in Fig. S20. Notably, the selectivity toward H2O2 production is gradually improved with the increase of annealing temperature. Fig. 4d shows the electron transfer number variations of the mixture annealed at different temperature. It can be found that the ORR tends to approach to 2e− pathway with the increase of alloying degree between Ni and B. Moreover, the H2O2 selectivity at 0.3 V versus RHE of these samples further confirms this conclusion (Fig. 4e). The density functional theory (DFT) calculations give more insights into the exact role of metalloid B for metal Ni. For the two-electron ORR, the overpotential derived from either hydrogeneration of O2 (Eq. (1)) or the reduction of OOH* to form H2O2 (Eq. (2)). O 2 + H 2 O + e - → O O H * + O H - (1) O O H * + e - → H 2 O - (2), (where * represents active sites). The projected density of states (PDOS) of Ni and Ni3B shown in Fig. 5 a and b indicates that the incorporation of metalloid B decreases the state density of Ni-3d orbital near the Fermi level relative to pure Ni. Due to the interaction between B and Ni, it is unfavorable for electrons transfer to realize the activation of O2, resulting in a difficult process to break OO bond and form *O and *OH [46,47]. Fig. 5c shows the free energy of each elementary step under U = 0.7 V on various catalysts, including Au, Pd, Au3Pd, Ni, and Ni3B. For an ideal electrocatalyst towards 2e− ORR, the absolute value of ΔGO2→*OOH should be closed to 0, which is propitious to the hydrogenation of O2 and H2O2 production. Obviously, Ni3B with downhill energy of 0.22 eV to form *OOH exhibits higher catalytic activity than Ni and other noble metal catalysts. Simultaneously, the two-electron volcano relationship between limiting potential (U L ) and ΔGO2→*OOH is established. Herein, the theoretical overpotential (η) is defined as the difference between the limiting potential and equilibrium potential U0 (0.7 V) [23]. As displayed in Fig. 5d, the closer limiting potential (U L ) approaches the top of the volcano (representing zero overpotential), the higher catalytic activity for the H2O2 production. Evidently, Ni3B with an overpotential of 0.22 V is more active, especially relative to metallic Ni, indicating that the formation of Ni-B alloy greatly improves the catalytic performance of two-electron ORR and offers an optional way as an alternative of noble metal catalysts."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, Ni3B was identified as a cost-effective and stable catalyst for the two-electron ORR toward H2O2. It shows a high selectivity of over 90 % and an outstanding mass activity of 16.5 A g−1 at 0.52 V versus RHE, which is comparable to some noble metal catalysts. Based on the experimental analysis, the high selectivity of Ni3B is ascribed to the alloying process of Ni and B, where the ORR tends to approach to 2e- pathway with the increase of alloying degree between Ni and B. Moreover, the incorporation of inner B atoms with high electronegativity decreases the state density of Ni-3d orbital near the Fermi level relative to Ni, which optimizes the binding of HOO* and makes the Ni3B a highly efficient and stable catalyst for the two-electron ORR. Our findings may have great implications for exploring earth-abundant and highly efficient catalysts for two-electron ORR."
