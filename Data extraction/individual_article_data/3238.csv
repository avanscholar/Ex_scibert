0,Introduction,"Developing green and sustainable energy is extremely imperative to address the great challenge related with the continuous depletion of traditional fossil fuels and a variety of serious environmental concerns [1,2]. Hydrogen (H2) has been considered as an ideal alternative to fossil fuels owing to its high gravimetric energy density and environmental friendliness, as well as earth-abundance [3,4]. Compared with conventional H2 production routes of methane reforming and coal gasification, electrochemical water splitting driven by renewable energy input is a viable way for large-scale H2 production with high purity [5–7]. Despite that tremendous efforts have been devoted to exploring highly efficient electrocatalysts for overall water splitting (OWS), the relatively large cell voltage is still needed for water electrolysis due to the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics that involves a complex four-electron-transfer process associated with high energy barrier for the bond-breaking of O–H [8–10]. To overcome this obstacle, researchers have proposed a novel strategy by substituting the unfavorable OER process with relatively thermodynamic favorable chemical oxidation reactions, including benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction [11], urea oxidation reaction [12,13], 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation [14], glucose oxidation reaction [15], glycerol oxidation reaction [16], and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) [17,18], etc, further enabling improved energy conversion efficiency for electrolytic H2 production. Among these alternatives, hydrazine (N2H4) can be easily oxidized than other chemical species, and only generate nitrogen and water during the oxidation process without carbon emission [17–19]. Therefore, coupling anodic HzOR with cathodic HER would drastically reduce the cell voltage and enhance the overall electrolytic efficiency compared to conventional electrocatalytic water splitting for H2 production. Up to now, the state-of-the-art HER and HzOR catalysts are still the high-cost Pt-based materials, which demands the studies focusing on the development of earth-abundant and highly-efficient nonprecious metal based alternatives [20–24]. Transition metal based alloys, due to the advantages of the high intrinsic activity, low cost, as well as flexible and adjustable composition, have demonstrated great potential as promising HER and/or HzOR electrocatalysts [25–30]. Among the multitudinous materials, Mo-Ni-based alloys (MoxNiy) have recently been widely investigated as competent candidates as HER electrocatalysts, benefiting from a largely reduced energy barrier towards the Volmer step and the elevated kinetics under alkaline conditions [25,27,31–33]. For example, Feng et al. reported an outstanding HER catalyst composed of MoNi4 nanoparticles supported by MoO2 cuboids on nickel foam (MoNi4/MoO2@NF) for efficient hydrogen evolution electrocatalysis in alkaline solution, which requires low overpotentials of only 15 and 44 mV to stably deliver cathodic current densities of 10 and 200 mA cm−2, respectively [25]. For HzOR catalysis, Ni-based binary alloy catalysts have received more attention since the regulable compositions endow tunable electronic structures with manipulated electrocatalytic activity [28,29,34,35]. For instance, single crystalline ultrathin nickel–cobalt alloy nanosheets array (NixCo1−x-ANSA) synthesized by Sun’s group can be utilized as a highly effective electrocatalyst for HzOR [29]. These pioneering works have greatly enlightened the idea of constructing the hybrid nanostructure by integrating different active components into unified platform to achieve highly efficient bifunctionality. In view of the above analysis, it can then be expected that the nanocomposite structure with the rational integration of MoNi4 and NiCo alloys could possess efficient hydrazine oxidation and hydrogen evolution catalytic activities, while the major challenge is the materials design and synthesis strategy. In this work, we reported a hierarchical multi-component nanosheet arrays grown on Ni foam composed of abundant NiCo/MoNi4 heterostructure interfaces on the amorphous MoOx substrate (denoted as NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF), which sucessfully integrates the HER active MoNi4 and HzOR active NiCo phases into a unified system and thus achieves outstanding bifunctionality. Specifically, it only demands an ultrasmall working potential of −30 mV (vs. RHE) to reach 10 mA cm−2 for HzOR in 1.0 M KOH/0.1 M N2H4 and a low overpotential of 68 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for HER in 1.0 M KOH. The two-electrode overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) electrolyzer with NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF as both the anode and cathode drives a large current density of 250 mA cm−2 at a cell voltage as low as 0.63 V, significantly lower than that of 2.87 V required for OWS. Importantly, the possible origins of the high performances are analyzed based on the combined observation of HRTEM, XRD, Raman, and XPS analyses for the products after HzOR and HER reaction."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation of samples,"2.1 Preparation of samples All the chemicals were of analytical grade purity and used as received without further purification. In a typical synthesis, 0.5 mmol of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (145.4 mg) and 0.5 mmol of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (145.5 mg) were dissolved into a mixed solution of 15 mL H2O and 15 mL ethanol at room temperature to form a clear solution, followed by the addition of 0.5 mmol of Na2MoO4·2H2O (121 mg) under magnetic stirring for 10 min. The mixed solution was then transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (50 mL in capacity). A piece of Ni foam (2 × 3 cm2) was immersed in 3 M HCl solution for 15 min to get rid of the possible surface oxide layer before it was put into the autoclave for reaction. A standard hydrothermal procedure was carried out at 150 °C for 6 h. After cooling down to room temperature naturally, the obtained precursor coated on Ni foam was then cleaned by ultrasonication to remove the loosely attached products on the surface. Finally, the substrate with loaded products was dried at 60 °C for further experiment and characterization. The other precursors were prepared by added different molar amounts of Na2MoO4·2H2O (0.25, 1, and 2 mmol) in the mixed solution, and the all other experimentconditions remained unchanged. For the NiMoOx NAs/NF and CoMoOx NAs/NF precursors, synthesis was similarly performed to the process of NiCoMoOx MNAs/NF, except that the addition of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Na2MoO4·2H2O or Co(NO3)2·6H2O and Na2MoO4·2H2O in the reaction solution. All different precursors grown on Ni foam were annealed in H2/Ar (10%/90%) mixture gas atmosphere at different temperature with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1."
3,Materials characterization,"2.2 Materials characterization The morphologies and structures of the samples were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-6700F), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL, JEM-2010), powder X-ray diffractor (XRD, TTR-III), and Raman spectrometer (LabRamHR) with a 532 nm excitation laser. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images were recorded using a Talox F200X (Thermo Fisher Scientific, America) transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV. The element composition was analyzed using a PerkinElmer: Optima 7300 DV ICP atomic emission spectrometer. The chemical states of the samples were performed at an ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with an X-ray source (Al Kα, hν = 1486.6 eV)."
4,Electrochemical measurements,"2.3 Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical HER, OER, and HzOR activity tests were performed on a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation using a conventional three-electrode system. NF supported catalysts (1 × 0.5 cm2) were used directly as the working electrode without any binder or support. Hg/HgO (1.0 M KOH) and a graphite rod were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. All potentials in this study were given versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according the following equations: E(RHE) = E(Hg/HgO) + 0.05916 × pH + 0.098. The electrolyte of 1.0 M KOH was used for the HER, OER and water electrolysis tests, and the electrolyte of 1.0 M KOH with different hydrazine concentrations were used for the HzOR and hydrazine electrolysis tests. The water electrolysis and hydrazine electrolysis were carried out in a two-electrode configuration using the NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF as the cathode and the anode, respectively. All linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were obtained via a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1 to decrease the capacitive background, which were performed after 60 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests to stabilize the current. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of HER and HzOR was investigated with a 5 mV AC potential from 10 kHz to 0.01 Hz. In the three-electrode tests of HER and HzOR, all the polarization curves were recorded with 100% iR compensation. The Tafel slope was obtained by fitting the linear portion of the Tafel plots to the Tafel equation [η = b log(j) + a]. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) can be calculated from the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) using the following equation: ECSA = Sgeo*Cdl/Cs. Wherein, “Cs” is specific electrochemical double-layer capacitance and its value in alkaline media is 0.040 mF cm−2, and the “Sgeo” represents the geometric surface area of the working electrode (0.5 cm2). TOF values were measured and calculated according to the previously reported equation: TOF = j/(2Fn), in which “j” is the HER current density, “n” is the number of active sites, and “F” is Faraday constant (96485C mol−1). The “n” values were measured and computed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) that measurements were performed in the potential range of 0–0.6 V vs RHE a fixed scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in 1.0 M KOH. Then, by integrating the charge of each CV curve over the whole potential range, the half value of the charge was obtained as the surface charge density (Qs). The “n” value was computed by n = Qs/F. The long-term durability was tested on a corresponding potential to support a current density of about 20 mA cm−2. To measure the performance of the overall hydrazine splitting: the polarization curves of hydrazine electrolysis were recorded from 0 to 1.2 V at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and chronoamperometric measurement was tested on corresponding potential to support a current density of around 20 mA cm−2. All the data for two-electrode electrolyser were collected without iR compensation. The amount of generated H2 and N2 from hydrazine electrolysis were conducted on a GC-7900 gas chromatograph containing a thermal conductivity detector. The Faradic efficiency (FE) was calculated by comparing the theoretical and experimental produced amounts of H2 and N2."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The synthetic procedures for NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF electrocatalyst can be schematically illustrated in the Scheme 1 . Firstly, the NiCoMoOx multi-component precursor nanosheet arrays were grown on Ni foam (denoted as NiCoMoOx MNAS/NF) by a hydrothermal treatment at 150 °C for 6 h in the water–ethanol system containing Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Co(NO3)2·6H2O and NaMoO4·2H2O. Followed by the thermal annealing at 550 °C under a reductive H2/Ar atmosphere, the precursor can be easily converted to crystalline NiCo and MoNi4 alloys decorated amorphous MoOx nanosheet arrays. To further optimize the catalytic activity, different precursors were prepared by controlling the added amounts of NaMoO4·2H2O. If there is no specific explanation in the following section, the NiCoMoOx MNAs/NF and NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF both represent the feeding of 0.5 mmol NaMoO4·2H2O. All detailed experimental conditions are provided in the Supplementary material. The morphologies of as-synthesized different precursors were firstly scrutinized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), where dense and smooth nanosheet arrays are uniformly grown on Ni foam skeleton to form an open network-like structure (Fig. S1 and S2). As shown in Fig. S3, the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of various precursors scraped from substrate demonstrate that the coexistence of NiMoO4 (JCPDS No. 13–0128) and CoMoO4 (JCPDS No. 21–0868) phases. The FESEM images clearly indicate that the NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF mostly inherits the morphology of precursor after the calcination, while much rougher and more porous nanosheet arrays can be observed (Fig. 1 a, b). Moreover, the sheet-like structure is composed of numerous nanoparticles with an average size of ca. 10 nm (Fig. 1c), which would ensure the more active sites exposured that are beneficial to enhance catalytic activity [36]. The control samples with different dosages of NaMoO4·2H2O also exhibit similar nanosheet structures (Fig. S4). The diffraction peaks in the corresponding XRD patterns after annealing (Fig. S5) can be attributed to mixture phase of the cubic NiCo alloy (JCPDS No. 04-0850) and tetragonal MoNi4 alloy (JCPDS No. 03–1036), respectively. Additionally, the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) analysis of NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF displays the well-crystallized NiCo and MoNi4 nanoparticles randomly dotted on the amorphous sheet-like substrate (Fig. 1d), and the intimate contact of two dissimilar adjacent nanoparticles further verifies the formation of NiCo-MoNi4 heterostructure interfaces. From the enlarged observation, the well-resolved lattice fringes with the interplanar distances of 0.203 and 0.18 nm are observed in the two nanoparticles from the enlarged HRTEM images (Fig. 1e, f), which could be assigned to the (111) plane of NiCo and (310) plane of MoNi4. Furthermore, the high angle annular dark feld scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) element mapping analysis reveal that the Mo and O elements are uniformly distributed on the whole nanosheet, while Ni and Co elements only disperse in the nanoparticulate regions (Fig. 1g). The atomic ratio of Ni and Co to Mo in the NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF catalyst was determined to be 33:33:34 by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), which is completely in accord with the feeding ratio. Thus, the above results manifest the possible presence of amorphous MoOx support after annealing, which could facilitate the desorption of generated H2 during the HER process [12]. The surface chemical compositions and elemental valence states of as-prepared NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF were further investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. In Fig. 2 a, the wide XPS spectrum scan clearly displays the characteristic peaks for Ni, Co, Mo and O elements. The high-resolution Ni 2p spectrum could be deconvoluted into six typical peaks as shown in Fig. 2b. The peaks whose binding energies centered at 852.9 eV and 870.0 eV are attributed to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively, corresponding to the metallic Ni [35,37]. In addition, there is a pair of peaks at 856.1 eV and 873.7 eV can be assigned to Ni2+ species resulted from the possible surface oxidation upon air exposure, accompanying with two satellite peaks at 861.9 eV and 880.1 Ev [12,35,37,38]. Meanwhile, by curve fitting of the Co 2p spectrum, the peaks located at 778.2 and 793.8 eV are ascribed to the Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 states of Co-Co/Co-Ni interaction, while the peaks centered at 781.3 and 797.1 eV correspond to the Co-O bonds (Fig. 2c) [39,40]. Moreover, the high-resolution Mo 3d spectrum reveales that Mo species exists three typical valence states whose peaks centered at 226.4 eV, 229 eV and 232.3 eV, corresponding to Mo0, Mo3+, and Mo6+ (Fig. 2d), corroborating the existence of Mo-based alloy and MoOx on the surface of NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF, respectively [40,41]. Finally, the Raman spectra also provide direct evidence of the structural evolution during the thermal reduction process, a series of typical Raman peaks at 341, 822, and 940 cm−1 are observed for both the NiCoMoOx MNAS/NF precursor and NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF, which are in line with previously reported Mo-O vibrations of NiMoO4 (Fig. S6) [42,43]. In the meantime, the appearance of several new vibrational modes in NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF, including the peaks at 480 and 725 cm−1 could be attributed the deformation of Mo = O stretching mode and the modification of Mo2-O bond for MoOx [44]. These spectroscopic analyses agree well with the aforementioned results, further confirming the formation of NiCo-MoNi4 heterostructures on the amorphous MoOx nanosheet substrate."
7,Investigation of electrocatalytic HzOR and HER activities,"3.2 Investigation of electrocatalytic HzOR and HER activities The electrocatalytic activity of NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF towards HzOR in 1.0 M KOH solution with hydrazine was measured by a typical three electrode system using Hg/HgO (containing 1.0 M KOH solution) as reference electrode and graphite rod as the counter electrode. All linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were corrected for iR compensation. The control samples with different dosages and annealing temperatures were tested firstly, among which the precursor of the NiCoMoOx MNAS/NF annealed at 550 °C possesses the best HzOR activity (Fig. S7 and S8). For comparison, the Ni-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF and Co-Co3Mo HMNAs/NF electrocatalysts were prepared by the identical synthesis approach to NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF except only Ni(NO3)2·6H2O or Co(NO3)2·6H2O was added during the synthesis of precursor nanosheet arrays (Figs. S9–S11). Fig. 3 a presents the LSV polarization curves of the NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF electrode in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte containing different hydrazine concentrations, where no abvious anodic current response can be observed at the investigated potential window in the absence of hydrazine, while a significant current increase can be initiated with the introduction of 0.1 M hydrazine, which is selected as the optimal concentration in our study because of the almost unchanged LSV curves upon increasing concentrations of hydrazine from 0.1 to 0.2 M. Moreover, when the scan rate increases from 5 to 50 mV s−1, there are no apparent current change in the LSV curves, suggesting the effcient charge and mass transport in the HzOR catalytic process (Fig. S12) [45]. Fig. 3b compares the electrocatalytic HzOR performances of NF, NiCoMoOx MNAs/NF, NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF, Ni-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF Co-Co3Mo HMNAs/NF and Pt/C in 1.0 M KOH/0.1 M hydrazine electrolyte, where the NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF electrode displays the highest HzOR activity and it only needs an ultralow working potential of −30 mV (vs. RHE) to obtain the current density of 10 mA cm−2. The very small Tafel slope of 28.5 mV dec-1 for NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF indicates the favorable catalytic kinetics toward HzOR (Fig. S13). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements (Fig. 3c) also disclose that the NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF has a much smaller charge transfer resistance (Rct), suggesting an improved interfacialchargetransfer between the hierarchical nanosheet and the electrolyte. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of different catalysts were estimated by the double-layer capacitance method in 1.0 M KOH (Fig. S14), in which the NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF electrode possesses a slightly higher ECSA value (186.3 cm2) than Ni-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF (136.3 cm2) and Co-Co3Mo HMNAs/NF (167.5 cm2). Apparently, the NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF still exhibits the best HzOR activity after LSV curves normalized by corresponding ECSA (Fig. S15), implying its high intrinsic catalytic activity. High durability is also crucial for the practical applications for the electrocatalyst. As shown in Fig. 3d, e, after 5000 cycles of repeated CV scanning, almost no decline can be observed. Furthermore, the Tafel plots and EIS results exhibit only slight changes before and after the stability test, which demonstrates the unchanged electrocatalytic kinetics after the stability test (Fig. S16). The long-term chronoamperometry curve also reveals a satisfied HzOR durability of NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF electrode, where 80% current density can be reserved after 25 h continuous test. Subsequently, when the electrolyte was replaced with the fresh 0.1 M/1.0 M KOH solution, the current density rapidly rises to ~ 20 mA cm−2, indicating the slow current density drop could be largely attributed to the consumption of hydrazine (Fig. 3f). Then, the HER activity of NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF electrode was also evaluated through a three-electrode configuration in 1.0 M KOH solution. Similarly, the sample (NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF) with identical dosage and annealing temperature to that for HzOR possesses the best HER catalytic activity (Figs. S17 and S18). As the LSV curves given in Fig. 3g, the NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF electrode delivers a small overpotential of 68 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is slightly larger compared to that of commercial Pt/C (37 mV), while much lower than that of other investigated catalysts. Besides, NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF also exhibits a much smaller Tafel slope (Fig. 3h) and Rct (Fig. S19), further revealing superior HER kinetics for NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF electrode. To further assess the intrinsic HER activities of as-prepared catalysts, j normalized by the ECSA and the turnover frequency (TOF) were measured and calculated, respectively. The current densities normalizedby ECSA for various catalysts further corfirmed the much higher intrinsic activity of NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF than Co-Co3Mo HMNAs/NF and Ni-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF (Fig. S20). Additionally, as shown in Figs. S21 and S22, the NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF has a relatively high TOF value (0.16 s−1 at η of 150 mV), which is 5.3 times compared to that of Co-Co3Mo HMNAs/NF (0.03 s−1) and 3.2 times than that of Ni-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF (0.05 s−1). Impressively, the long-term durability tested at −96 mV vs. RHE (@ 20 mA cm−2) indicates a high current density retention rate of 90% after 40 h continuous electrolysis (Fig. 3i). Additionally, the polarization curves of NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF catalyst before and after 5000 CV test nearly overlap with each other, and no obvious variations are observed in Tafel plots and Nyquist plots (Fig. S23), further indicating excellent stability for HER. The bifunctional performance of NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF heterostructure is indeed superior to that of reference samples, thus attributing to successful integration of HzOR and HER active components and synergistically boosting the HER/HzOR activity. The superior performance makes the NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF top rank among the most transition metal-based catalysts for HzOR and HER under alkaline conditions (see details in Tables S1 and S2)."
8,Characterizations after HzOR and HER,"3.3 Characterizations after HzOR and HER To gain a better understanding on the origin of activity and stability, the NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF electrocatalyst after long-term HzOR and HER measurements were further characterized. It has been reported that the non-transition metal oxides or (oxy)hydroxides could likely form metal oxides/hydroxides on the surface or even in the bulk as the real active species during the electrocatalytic process under strong alkaline conditions [17,46–48]. For our research system, this kind of similar hydroxylated process has also been observed in the NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF electrode during electrolysis. The sheet-like morphology decorated with numerous nanoparticles can be well maintained after the long-term stability test (Fig. S24). Specifically, the surfaces of nanosheets obviously become wrinkled after HzOR durability test, suggesting the possible in-situ formation of hydroxides. The structure changes of the NiCo-MoNi4 heterostructures were explored by the HRTEM analyses after HzOR test, where the lattice fringe spacings of initial phases are 0.18 and 0.203 nm corresponding to the (310) plane of MoNi4 alloy and the (111) plane of NiCo alloy could still be detected (Fig. 4 a, 4a1, a2), while the new fringe spacing of 0.23 nm could be attributed to the distance of (101) or (200) facet in Co(OH)2 (JCPDS 45–0031) or Ni(OH)2 (JCPDS 45–0031) (Fig. 4a3) [49]. The elemental mapping result shows the existence of Ni, Co, Mo, and O (Fig. 4b), indicating the unchanged elemental composition after HzOR test. Likewise, the ex-situ HRTEM images after HER prove that the existence of pristine NiCo and MoNi4 active phases, whereas the lattice spacing corresponding to the hydroxide nanoparticles could also be observed (Fig. 4c, 4c1-c3). In addition, the EDS elemental mapping result also reveals the existence of Ni, Co, Mo, and O elements on the nanosheet after HER test in alkaline condition (Fig. 4d). As shown in Fig. 4e, the new and weak diffraction peaks of the metal hydroxides are also observed besides NiCo and MoNi4 phases by XRD after HzOR and HER tests. The Raman spectroscopy was further carried out to monitor the structuralchanges before and afterthe catalytic reactions. In Fig. 4f, the Raman spectra clearly indicate the appearance of a new broad characteristic peak at ca. 520 cm−1 ascribed to the vibration of the Ni-O/Co-O [50], while the pristine Raman peaks of Mo-O vibrations at 818, 890 and 940 cm−1 only exhibit the change of intensity after HzOR/HER test. The changes of the surface chemical states were finally inspected by XPS before and after the stability test. All of the high-resolution Ni 2p XPS spectra can be deconvoluted into Ni0 and Ni2+, showing a noticeable increase in the Ni2+/Ni0 after HER and HzOR, which might be caused by the generation of Ni(OH)2 species (Fig. 4g). The Co 2p spectra in Fig. 4h are in accordance with the Ni 2p results, where significant increase of Co2+/Co0 is observed in NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF after stability test. In contrast to the XPS spectra of pristine NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF, the average valence state of Mo clearly increases after long-term catalytic measurements. By carefully fitting Mo 3d spectra, the Mo3+, Mo4+, and Mo6+ are found on the surface of nanosheets after HzOR, and the valence states of Mo2+, Mo4+ and Mo6+ are simultaneously distinguished after HER (Fig. 4i), suggesting the oxidations of most Mo0 to high-valent Mo2+ or Mo4+. Specifically, the remaining NiCo and MoNi4 active components may assure the sufficient active sites for intermediates adsorption and support the effcient charge transfer, as for the formation of hydroxide species probably facilitate the water dissociation and provide favorable active sites for hydroxyl adsorption which further renders fast reaction kinetics [51–53]."
9,Evaluation of NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF as bifunctional catalyst for OHzS,"3.4 Evaluation of NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF as bifunctional catalyst for OHzS Inspired by the remarkable HzOR and HER activity of the NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF, a two-electrode electrolyser using NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF as both the cathode and anode was assembled. The home-made device of OHzS for electrochemical hydrazine-assisted water electrolysis for hydrogen production is schematically depicted in Fig. 5 a. The HzOR and OER activities of NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF were compared by LSV tests (Fig. 5b), and it only requires a small working potential of 0.194 V (vs. RHE) to achieve current density of 400 mA cm−2 for HzOR, 1.75 V lower than that of traditional OER. Additionally, the hydrazine in electrolyte has little impact on the HER activity (Fig. S25), which could guarantee the feasibility for hydrazine-assisted energy-saving H2 production. As expected, the polarization curves demonstrate that the OHzS displays a higher current density than the OWS at the same applied potential (Fig. 5c), owing to significant thermodynamic and kinetic advantages of hydrazine oxidation. The OHzS system needs the ultrasmall cell voltages of 0.186, 0.315, 0.426, 0.532 and 0.63 V to obtain current densities of 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 mA cm−2, whereas the OWS demands much higher values of 2.059, 2.28, 2.484, 2.683 and 2.871 V, respectively (Fig. 5d). Remarkably, the electrocatalytic activity of NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF for OHzS is also better than that of noble Pt/C couple (Fig. S26) and state-of-the-art non-noble metal catalysts reported recently (Table S3). In addition, the current density after the 10 h continuous potentiostatic electrolysis test exhibits a retention rate of 80%, indicating the good stability of NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF for hybrid water electrolysis (Fig. 5e). The FE for H2 and N2 generation were also measured at a constant current density of 20 mA cm−2 by gas chromatography (Fig. 5f and S27). The H2 and N2 with a volume ratio close to 2:1, and the amount of experimentally measured H2 and N2 production are in good agreement with the theoretical values, implying a nearly 100% FE for HER and HzOR during electrolysis process."
10,Conclusion,"In summary, we proposed an effective materials-by-design rationale to achieve bifunctionality towards hydrazine oxidation and hydrogen evolution catalysis through constructing a hierarchical multi-component nanosheet arrays grown on Ni foam composed of abundant NiCo/MoNi4 heterostructure interfaces on the amorphous MoOx substrate (denoted as NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF). Impressively, the electrode could deliver an ultrasmall working potential of −30 mV (vs. RHE) in 1.0 M KOH/0.1 M N2H4 electrolyte for HzOR and a small overpotential of 68 mV for HER in 1.0 M KOH to achieve 10 mA cm−2. Importantly, the post-catalytic characterizations further disclose the good stabilization of NiCo/MoNi4 active phases, while the partial formation of transition metal hydroxide species probably endow favorable absorption for hydroxyl intermediates, leading to the high performance and durability. As a demonstration, the two-electrode OHzS electrolyzer with NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF as both the anode and cathode can generate a large current density of 250 mA cm−2 with a cell voltage of 0.63 V. This work provides a feasible method to achieve bifunctionality for hydrazine oxidation assisted energy-saving hydrogen production, which could push forward the development of future hydrogen economy."
