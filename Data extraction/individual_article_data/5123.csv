0,Introduction,"The sustainable production of hydrogen through electrocatalytic water splitting is a potential pathway for obtaining clean energy due to its environmental friendliness and high energy conversion efficiency [1,2]. Effective electrocatalysts are necessary for high efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Pt-group catalysts are regarded as high-activity HER electrocatalysts [3]. However, their practical applications are limited by high cost and scarce global resources [4]. In the past few years, cheap, earth-rich, efficient and sustainable catalysts, including transition metal phosphides [5,6], sulfides [7,8], selenides [9,10] and oxides [11,12], are widely studied to alter the noble metal-based electrocatalysts. In addition, these catalysts are usually loaded on carbon or foam supports to form the electrode, which would affect the long-term stability and be difficult for widespread application [13]. Hence, it is very crucial to explore self-supported catalysts with excellent efficiency and good stability for the HER. Many methods, such as template assisted [14], hydrothermal [15], and dealloying [16], were used to synthesize self-supported electrocatalysts. Dealloying is a selective corrosion process involving the dissolution of active atoms and the reorganization of inert atoms [17]. The uniform bicontinuous nanoporous structure produced by dealloying can expose a larger specific surface area and provide more accessible interior active sites [18]. It was reported that nanoporous transition metal compound catalysts exhibited good HER performance in alkaline electrolyte [6]. Nevertheless, the friability of self-supported material is serious problem for its industrialization in flexible electrode devices. Recently, the amorphous alloys with good mechanical properties were suggested to be catalysts for HER. Moreover, amorphous alloys exhibit good catalytic activity due to the unique disorder structure and inherent abundant defects that would generate more active sites [18]. Hu et al. prepared PdNiCuP ribbons with stable amorphous structure as a high activity electrocatalyst for water splitting process [19]. Xu et al. synthesized an amorphous nanoporous Ni-Fe-P material with good properties for both HER and OER in alkaline conditions [20]. Zhang et al. reported that FeCoPC catalyst exhibited a good HER activity [5]. In this work, a facile and promising strategy was designed to fabricate self-supported nanoporous Ni-Co-P (np-Ni-Co-P) catalysts via an electrochemical dealloying method. The 3D binder-free amorphous np-Ni-Co-P catalyst exhibits markedly high catalytic activity for HER with overpotential of 114 ​mV ​at a current density of 10 ​mA ​cm−2, low Tafel slope around 57.3 ​mV dec−1 and good stability in alkaline medium."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials preparation,"2.1 Materials preparation The Ni60Co20P20 master alloy was prepared by melting pure Ni (99.99 ​at.%), pure Co (99.99 ​at.%) and Ni2P (99.7 ​at.%) in a high-frequency induction melting furnace under high purity argon atmosphere. A melt spinning technique was used to prepare amorphous alloy ribbons with the dimensions of ~1 ​mm wide and ~20 ​μm thick. The precursor ribbons were cut to 30 ​mm ​× ​1 ​mm. The part of ribbon with length of 10 ​mm was served as the working area, and the other part was sealed with silica gel as the clamping part. Thus the area of the working electrode was 0.2 ​cm−2. The Ni60Co20P20 ribbons were electrochemically etched under 0.2 ​V vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE) in 1 ​M HCl solution in a standard three-electrode setup with a SCE as the reference electrode and a graphite sheet as the counter electrode by using an electrochemical workstation. The control samples for nanoporous Ni-P (np-Ni-P) and nanoporous Co-P (np-Co-P) catalyst was prepared by using the same process with Ni60Mn20P20 and Co80P20 as the precursor alloys, respectively. Finally, the dealloyed samples were washed in distilled water and ethyl alcohol for three times and then dried for 12 ​h in a vacuum drying oven."
3,Materials characterization,"2.2 Materials characterization The phases of the as-synthesized samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, BrukerD8) using Cu Kα radiation. The surface morphologies and elemental composition of the as-synthesized samples were obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, JSM-7800F). Transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL 2100 ​M) was used to carried out transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) tests. The surface valence state were collected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHL1600ESCA)."
4,Electrocatalytic measurements,"2.3 Electrocatalytic measurements The electrochemical property of all samples were measured on a typical three-electrode setup (Gamry Reference 1000) at room temperature, with 1.0 ​M KOH solution as the electrolyte. The as-synthesized catalysts, a graphite sheet, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) electrode served as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively. The potential conversion was calibrated (from vs. SCE) to the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) based on the Nernst equation: E(RHE) ​= ​E(SCE)+0.241 ​+ ​0.059 ​pH. Linear-sweep voltammetry (LSV) for the HER was tested with a scanning rate of 5 ​mV ​s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data were obtained at 150 ​mV (vs. RHE) for the HER with the frequency ranging from 0.1 to 105 ​Hz. All polarization curves were corrected for iR compensation by applying the following equation: Ecorr ​= ​Emea−iRs, where Ecorr is the iR-corrected potential, Emea is the measured potential and Rs is the resistance of the system. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted to estimate the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) within ±50 ​mV vs open-circuit potential (OCP) under different scan rates of 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 ​mV ​s−1. The turnover frequency (TOF) value is calculated from the equation: TOF ​= ​J ​× ​A/(2 ​× ​F ​× ​n), where J is the measured current density at the overpotential of 100 ​mV, A is the surface area of the working electrode, F is the Faraday constant (96485 c mol−1), n is the number of moles of active materials loaded on the electrodes [21,22]. The durability of the samples were measured by chronoamperometry (CA) and 3000 cycles of CV scans. Moreover, commercial Pt/C catalyst (5 ​wt%, Alfa Aesar) was used as the control electrodes. 4 ​mg of commercial Pt/C was added to a solution involving 50 ​μL Nafion and 200 ​μL ethanol to form a homogeneous ink. Finally, 20 ​μL catalyst ink was coated on to the surface of a glassy carbon electrode (surface area: 0.2826 ​cm−2) for three times and the dried at room temperature."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Structure and morphology analysis,"3.1 Structure and morphology analysis Fig. 1 a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all the precursor ribbons. The Ni60Co20P20 and Ni60Mn20P20 precursors are amorphous, while the Co80P20 precursorexists two crystalline phases, including orthorhombic Co2P and hexagonal-close-packed (HCP) cobalt [23]. After dealloying, np-NiCoP and np-NiP still maintain amorphous structure, while the HCP cobalt is significantly reduced for the np-Co-P sample (Fig. 1b). Compared with the crystal phase, the surface chemistry of amorphous catalysts can be optimized to enhance the performance on the level of molecular [8,24]. The retained mechanical flexibility after undergoing eletrochemical dealloying demonstrate a superior self-supported capability of np-Ni-Co-P (as shown in Fig. S1), which would favor in elimination of the interface overpotential and rapid charge transfer during the electrolysis process [25]. Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of the as-synthesized np-Ni-Co-P, np-Co-P and np-Ni-P samples. All samples exhibit the analogous bicontinuous nanostructures with both the ligaments and pores on a large scale. The nano-scale ligaments and pores can efficiently provide abundant active sites and ion-diffusion routes, which are conducive to mass transfer and electron mobility. The corresponding energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis indicates that the atomic ratio of the np-Ni-Co-P, np-Co-P and np-Ni-P are close to 1.34: 0.76: 1, 2.04: 1 and 2.60: 1, respectively (Fig. S2 and Table S1). The phosphorus content in all samples are also similar (about 30 ​at.%). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the np-Ni-Co-P (Fig. 3 a) further reveals a uniform bicontinuous nanoporous architecture consisting of interlinked metallic ligaments. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) (inset of Fig. 3b) further certify a homogeneous amorphous nature of the np-Ni-Co-P down to nanoscale (Fig. 3b) because diffraction spots and crystalline lattices cannot be seen. Element mapping result in Fig. 3c manifests that Ni, Co and P elements disperse on the np-Ni-Co-P sample surface uniformly, where no phase separation or elemental segregation is observed. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) test was performed to determine the surface chemistry for np-Ni-Co-P, np-Co-P and np-Ni-P in the Ni 2p, Co 2p and P 2p spectra. In the Ni 2p3/2 spectrum (Fig. 4 a), the binding energy at 852.84 ​eV can be assigned to Niδ+ in metal phosphides, while other peaks with higher binding energies of 853.42, 856.00 and 860.5 ​eV belong to Ni2+, Ni3+ and the appropriate satellite peak, respectively [26,27]. The Co 2p3/2 XPS spectrum (Fig. 4b) could be divided into three peaks. The peak at 778.33 ​eV belongs to Coδ+ in metal phosphides, and the other two peaks located at 780.20 and 782.37 ​eV can be attributed to the Co2+ and Co3+, respectively, which should arise from the surface oxidation after long-time exposure to the air [28,29]. Fig. 4c shows the high-resolution P 2p spectra consisting of a doublet of P 2p3/2 component at 129.25 ​eV and P 2p1/2 component at 130.13 ​eV from metal phosphides. Moreover, the peak at 132.67 ​eV is ascribed to oxidized phosphate species [30,31]. Obviously, Ni 2p3/2 and Co 2p3/2 in the np-Ni-Co-P exhibit as lightly positive energy shift, while P 2p shows a slightly negative shift compared to np-Ni-P and np-Co-P, implying the different electronic structures for all samples. The positive shift of Ni 2p3/2 and Co 2p3/2 binding energies of np-Ni-Co-P catalyst reveals the enhanced electron transfer, while the negative shift of P 2p3/2 indicates the improved electron occupation, which would lead to heightening electron donating ability [16]. In the electrocatalysis process, the positive Ni and Co centers serve as hydride-acceptor, while the negative P centers serve as proton-acceptor sites [32]. The diffusion of electrons from metallic centers Ni and Co to P can effectively accelerate absorption/desorption of H atoms on active site for the HER [33]."
7,HER performance,"3.2 HER performance The electrocatalytic HER properties were evaluated by means of a typical three-electrode setup in 1 ​M KOH solution, where the as-synthesized materials were directly employed as binder-free catalytic electrodes. Fig. 5 a shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of all the as-synthesized samples with a scanning rate of 5 ​mV ​s−1. As seen, the commercial Pt/C (20%) requires a lowest overpotential of 26 ​mV to reach the current density of 10 ​mA ​cm−2. The np-Ni-Co-P catalyst exhibits good catalytic activity with overpotential of 114 ​mV to achieve the current density of 10 ​mA ​cm−2, which is 9 and 206 ​mV lower than those of np-Co-P and np-Ni-P. According to the LSV results, bimetallic phosphides (np-Ni-Co-P) display a lower overpotential compared with the single-metal phosphides (np-Co-P and np-Ni-P). This result illustrates that the synergistic interplay of Ni and Co could efficaciously enhance the HER electrocatalytic performance. The HER reaction kinetics is assessed by the Tafel slope. In Fig. 5b, the np-Ni-Co-P exhibits a Tafel slope of 57.3 ​mV dec−1, outperforming the np-Co-P (69.9 ​mV dec−1) and np-Ni-P (123.1 ​mV dec−1), suggesting the markedly accelerated HER kinetics of the np-Ni-Co-P catalyst. The Tafel slope value of np-Ni-Co-P catalyst within the range of 40∼120 ​mV dec−1 implies that the HER processes via the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism [34,35], which can be described as follow: (1) Volmer reaction:H2O ​+ ​M ​+ ​e−→ M-Had ​+ ​OH− (2) Heyrovsky reaction:H2O ​+ ​M-Had ​+ ​e− → H2+OH− where M presents the active site of the catalyst for HER, and Had presents a H atom absorbed at the active site of the catalyst. The low overpotential and Tafel slope values demonstrate that the np-Ni-Co-P catalyst has better electrocatalytic activity than other reported metal-based HER catalysts (Table S2 and Table S3). The electrochemical active area (ECSA) of the as-synthesized catalysts were estimated by CV curves in the non-Faraday region of ±0.05 ​V versus open-circuit potential (OCP) (Fig. S3). Noticeably, the number of active sites of np-Co-P is 84 times higher than that of np-Ni-P, suggesting that Co might form the major active sites toward HER. The number of active sites with np-Ni-Co-P catalyst is reduced by 4.7 times compared to the np-Co-P catalyst. Nevertheless, according to the turnover frequency (TOF) result, the TOF of np-Ni-Co-P catalyst is calculated to be 0.13 ​s−1 ​at η ​= ​100 ​mV, which is 1.3 and 37 times higher than that of np-Co-P (0.10 ​s−1) and np-Ni-P (0.0035 ​s−1), respectively (Fig. 5c). The intrinsic catalytic activity of the np-Ni-Co-P catalyst is significantly enhanced with the addition of Co. The enhanced intrinsic activity might be ascribed to the joint action of Ni and Co due to the change of electron structure of P which further optimizes the free energy of H adsorption [36]. The charge-transfer resistance is also an indispensable parameter affecting the performance of electrocatalysts. EIS was carried out to further evaluate the HER reaction kinetics of as-synthesized catalysts. As displayed in Fig. 4d, the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) value of np-Ni-Co-P is 5.9 ​Ω, which are much smaller than of np-Co-P (9.2 ​Ω) and np-Ni-P (47.7 ​Ω), revealing rapid electron transport ability and charge-transfer kinetic during the HER process. This is favorable for HER performance. The durability of the electrocatalysts was assessed by chronoamperometry and cyclic CV tests. Fig. 6 a shows a slight current degradation of the np-Ni-Co-P catalyst under constant overpotential of 120 ​mV for 20 ​h test, indicating good durability. However, the CV curve of np-Ni-Co-P has small decay (~28 ​mV) after 3000 cycles (Fig. 6b). The structure of the np-Ni-Co-P catalyst after the electrochemical durability test for 3000 CV cycles in alkaline medium was also characterized by using XRD, SEM, TEM, HRTEM and XPS. The XRD patterns (Figure. S4) of the np-Ni-Co-P catalyst after 3000 CV cycles is almost same as that of the initial catalyst. The SEM, TEM and HRTEM images (Figure. S5 and Figure. S6) still display similar nanoporous structure and uniform distribution of all elements with those in Figs. 2a and 3. Fig. S7 shows the XPS spectrum of np-Ni-Co-P after 3000 CV cycles. The extinction of Niδ+/Coδ+ species is connected with the decrease of Ni/Co-P bonds, which indicates that metal phosphide is gradually transformed into metal oxide/hydroxide. Meanwhile, the appearance of a new peak at 529.18 ​eV in the O 1s spectrum further illustrates the formation of Ni-Co oxides/hydroxides. This should be due to the large polarization during the CV test. The Ni-Co oxides/hydroxides are intrinsically adverse electrocatalytic species for the HER, resulting in initial decay of current density [28]. Nevertheless, the intrinsic active of np-Ni-Co-P could transform the partial surface electronic state of the Ni-Co oxides/hydroxides, thus retaining the outstanding HER catalytic activity inalkaline electrolyte."
8,Conclusions,"An amorphous nanoporous Ni-Co-P electrocatalyst has been successfully fabricated via a facile electrochemical delloying process. The np-Ni-Co-P catalyst exhibits outstanding HER catalytic activity with the overpotential of 114 ​mV ​at a current density of 10 ​mA ​cm−2 and small Tafel slope of 57.3 ​mV dec−1 in alkaline solution. The outstanding HER performance is ascribed to the bicontinuous nanoporous structure, the alloying effect and disorder atomic arrangement. The synergetic effect of the Ni and Co elements improves the intrinsic activity of active sites. The facile synthesis of np-Ni-Co-P electrocatalysts with high performance and great durability may open up a new strategy for the application."
