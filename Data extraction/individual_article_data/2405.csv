0,Introduction,"As a source of energy from renewable raw materials and through biological processes, hydrogen production is a promising alternative because it is environmentally friendly and clean and it provides inexhaustible energy generation [1]. To reduce process costs and to reduce the pollutant load, it is beneficial to study wastewater that is rich in carbohydrates for use as individual substrates or as mixtures for hydrogen production [2]. Glucose, the main and most commonly used carbohydrate, can lead to H2 production by three types of fermentation: propionic acid, butyric acid or ethanol-type fermentations. In propionic acid-type fermentation, propionic acid is the main byproduct, and the yield is affected, with a consumption of 2 mol of hydrogen for 1 mol of glucose. In the butyric acid-type fermentation, if acetate represents the reduced byproduct from glucose fermentation, the H2 yield will be 4 mol H2 mol−1 glucose, whereas 2 mol of H2 will be produced if butyrate is the final product. Finally, the ethanol-type fermentation produces 2 mol of hydrogen and 1 mol of ethanol from 1 mol of glucose [3]. The control of some factors, such as pH, reactor configuration, substrate used as a carbon source, inoculum type, HRT and the use of co-substrates, affect the fermentative pathways favoring the hydrogen production [4]. The varied differences reported in the literature reflected the influence of some of these parameters on the optimal conditions for the fermentative production of hydrogen. These differences showed that there is no agreement on the ideal conditions for H2 production. Furthermore, a majority of the reported studies were performed with glucose and sucrose, and in these cases the optimal conditions have already been established comparing to complex organic waste [5]. Studies using real wastewater have demonstrated strong evidence of hydrogen production, including experiments in batch reactors using palm oil [6], cheese whey [7] and sugar cane vinasses [8]. Additionally, other experiments in continuous reactors had been investigated using cassava processing wastewater [9], cheese whey [10] and vinasses [11]. Cheese whey is the main byproduct of cheese manufacturing and is considered a highly polluting effluent from dairy production due to its high organic load and the generated volume. Thus, cheese whey is a highly attractive source for use as a substrate for hydrogen production, not only because it is plentiful and readily available but also because it is highly biodegradable [12]. It is estimated that 70% of cheese whey dry extract is composed of lactose [13]. At a maximum theoretical yield of 8.0 mol H2 mol−1 lactose [7] cheese whey has also been studied in batch reactors as the sole source of carbon for hydrogen bioproduction through dark fermentation [7,14]. The fermentation of this residue was also performed in continuous reactors, including an anaerobic digester [15], a UASB reactor [12], a CSTR reactor [10] and an anaerobic fixed bed reactor [13]. These studies showed that the continual operation of hydrogen provides stability, high productivity and yield, especially when compared with batch fermentations [16]. The literature also reports that simple substrates, such as glucose, have been used in mixtures with other complex substrates in the search for optimal conditions for hydrogen production: glucose with xylose [17,18], with glycerol [19] and with galactose [2]. The strategy of using mixed substrates demonstrates the high interest among researchers in evaluating the feasibility of hydrogen production via waste fermentation in the presence of glucose. However, the use of cheese whey in anaerobic fluidized bed reactors as an organic source in the presence or absence of glucose content has not been evaluated with respect to hydrogen bioproduction, concomitant with by-acidogenic product modifications and distributions. Thus, the present study aims to evaluate hydrogen production from glucose using cheese whey and the mixture of glucose and cheese whey as carbon sources. Additionally, this study aims to determine the influence of different inoculum types on the fermentation process and the distribution of metabolic end products in two anaerobic fluidized bed reactors with an applied HRT of 6 h."
1,Methods,
2,Inocula and substrates,"2.1 Inocula and substrates Two different inocula were used for the inoculation of the reactors. Both inocula were subjected to heat pre-treatments [20]. This procedure allows the elimination of methanogenic vegetative and acidogenic non-endospore forming cells, ensuring the survival of acidogenic cells capable of endospore formation. An AFBR1 reactor was inoculated with sludge from a UASB reactor used in the treatment of swine wastewater, while an AFBR2 reactor was inoculated with sludge from a UASB reactor which treated poultry slaughterhouse wastewater. The fermentation medium consisted of 5 g COD L−1 of substrate using different carbon sources: glucose, powdered cheese whey and a mixture of cheese whey and glucose. The micronutrient supplementation for the synthetic wastewater composed of glucose was prepared according to Barros and Silva [21]. For 5 g of cheese whey in powder form per liter, had an initial of pH 6 with a total carbohydrate content of 4 g L−1 and a COD concentration of 5 g L−1. The medium was also buffered with NaHCO3."
3,Anaerobic fluidized bed reactor operation,"2.2 Anaerobic fluidized bed reactor operation The reactors used for hydrogen production were constructed of transparent acrylic with 5-mm-thick walls, internal diameters of 3.5 cm, heights of 80 cm and total volumes of 770 cm3, as shown in Fig. 1 . The reactors were filled with polystyrene as support material, at dimensions of 2.2 × 2.2 mm. The temperature was maintained at 30 ± 1 °C with a water jacket, piping water from a recirculating ultrathermostatical bath. Different carbon sources were fed to the reactors: glucose and cheese whey were each evaluated individually. For the evaluation of the mixture of cheese whey and glucose, the experiments were performed in three phases, as shown in Table 1 . The reactors were fed at substrate concentrations of 5 g COD L−1 in heat-treated sludge (10% v/v). For the AFBRs operation, a superficial velocity 1.30 times greater than the minimum fluidization velocity was used. Initially, the reactors were operated in batch mode for 76 h and continuously afterward with an HRT of 6 h for a total 153 days of operation. When the hydrogen production reached a steady state (i.e., a variation less than 10%), the proportions of glucose and cheese whey were modified. The gas concentrations and the produced soluble metabolite were monitored as a function of operation time."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods Volumetric hydrogen production was measured by the Ritter MilliGas-counter (Type: MGC-1). The biogas hydrogen content was determined by gas chromatography (GC-2010, Shimadzu, Japan) using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) with argon as the carrier gas and a Supelco Carboxen 1010 Plot packed column (30 m × 0.53 mm i.d.). The organic acids and alcohol concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography (HPLC Shimadzu) equipped with a pump (LC-10ADVP), an autosampler (SIL-20A HT), a column oven (CTO-20A) at 43 °C, a refractive index detector (RID-10A), a system Controller (SCL-10AVP) and column HPX-87H Aminex (300 mm, 7.8 mm, BioRad). The mobile phase consisted of H2SO4 (0.01 N) at 0.5 mL min−1. Carbohydrate concentrations were performed by a colorimetric method according to Barros and Silva [21]. The pH levels were analyzed according to the Standard Methods [22]."
5,Result and discussion,
6,Hydrogen production and soluble microbial products in the fermentation of glucose,"3.1 Hydrogen production and soluble microbial products in the fermentation of glucose In the fermentation of glucose as the sole carbon source, hydrogen (H2) content was 16.25% and 26.25%, hydrogen production rate (HPR) was 0.96 L d−1 L−1 and 1.92 L d−1 L−1 and hydrogen yields (HY) of 0.9 mmol H2 g−1 COD (0.24 mol H2 mol−1 glucose) and 1.37 mmol H2 g−1 COD (0.44 mol H2 mol−1 glucose) were determined for AFBR1 and AFBR2, respectively. Table 2 compares the yields of hydrogen and the hydrogen production rate with other studies that used glucose as substrate. These studies used different reactor configurations, different sources of inoculum and different operating conditions, including variations in the HRT and pH levels. In the operation of AFBRs, a hydrogen yield of 0.94 mol H2 mol−1 glucose was found at 4 h HRT [26]. Koskinen et al. [25] obtained an HY value of 0.39 mol mol−1 glucose and an HPR of 0.018 L d−1 L−1 a similar to the results obtained in this study for the AFBR2 (0.44 mol H2 mol−1 glucose). In a different reactor configuration, Sreethawong et al. [24] evaluated the performance of sequential batch reactors for the production of hydrogen and obtained a yield of 0.2 mol H2 mol−1 glucose at an HRT of 24 h (COD loading rate of 10 kg m−3 d−1). This study showed satisfactory results comparable with results in the literature, obtaining a yield of 0.44 mol mol−1 glucose and a maximum hydrogen production rate of 1.92 L d−1 L−1 from the sludge of a poultry slaughterhouse (AFBR2). This shows that even under different operating conditions, it is possible to obtain results similar to those reported in the literature. Fig. 2 shows the major soluble metabolites produced, such as lactic acid (HAl), ethanol (EtOH), methanol (MetOH), acetic acid (HAc), propionic acid (HPr), isobutyric acid (HIBu) and butyric acid (HBu). In AFBR1 and AFBR2, ethanol (44% and 41%, respectively), methanol (24% and 25%), acetic acid (21%, 12%), butyric acid (4% and 7%), isobutyric acid (4% and 7%) and lactic acid (2% and 9%) were the major metabolites produced. Propionic acid was detected at less than 2%. Hydrogen produced using glucose as an individual substrate occurred by the fermentation of ethanol and acetic acid, showing the prevalence of these metabolites in both reactors. Ethanol yields of 1.6 mmol EtOH g−1 COD (AFBR1) and 1.7 mmol EtOH g−1 COD (AFBR2) were obtained. Hwang et al. [3] suggested a possible metabolic pathway with the concomitant production of hydrogen and ethanol as shown in Eq. (1): (1) C6H12O6 + H2O → C2H5OH + CH3COOH + 2H2 + 2CO2 The AFBR1 (sludge swine) showed lower percentages of lactic acid and higher percentages of acetic acid, compared with the AFBR2 (sludge of poultry slaughterhouse), indicating different results between the two inocula. Moreover, both inocula had the potential to produce ethanol at higher percentages of 44% (AFBR1) and 41% (AFBR2)."
7,Hydrogen production and soluble metabolites in the co-fermentation of glucose and cheese whey,"3.2 Hydrogen production and soluble metabolites in the co-fermentation of glucose and cheese whey The co-fermentation of glucose and cheese whey was evaluated in reactors using different ratios between the substrates at HRTs of 6 h Table 3 shows the values of HPR, YH and H2 content in the AFBR1 and AFBR2 reactors. No methane was detected in the reactors. It was observed that HPR ranged from 0.96 to 2.16 L d−1 L−1 (AFBR1) and 1.2–2.64 L d−1 L−1 (AFBR2). The greatest HY was 1.6 mmol H2 g−1 COD (Phase 3) and 1.7 mmol H2 g−1 COD (Phase 3) in the AFBR1 and AFBR2 reactors, respectively. Changes in the ratio of glucose and cheese whey were reflected in the content of hydrogen in the biogas in AFBR2 (sludge poultry slaughterhouse). In phase 1, only 13% H2 was obtained, whereas in phases 2 and 3, the biogas contained 21 and 22% H2, which both showed a positive correlation with increasing cheese whey percentages in the mixture. As for the AFBR1 reactor (sludge swine), hydrogen content remained stable between 16.25 and 18.55%. Moreover, the AFBR1 and AFBR2 showed linear behavior between of HY and increased proportion of cheese whey, resulting in a highest HY in phase 3. The sludge from swine wastewater (AFBR1) had hydrogen production was more stable throughout the phases, but the sludge from the poultry slaughterhouse (AFBR2) resulted in the highest HPR (2.64 L d−1 L−1), HY (1.7 mmol H2 g−1 COD) and hydrogen content in the biogas (22%). In a recent study of the co-fermentation of cheese whey by Bertin et al. [27], a mixture of 50% cheese whey and 50% chicken manure was fed to a two-stage process, leading to a hydrogen production of 3700 mg L−1. Gelegenis et al. [28] used several dilutions of chicken manure with cheese whey in a CSTR reactor and reported that by using 40% cheese whey feed medium, favorable hydrogen production was observed, resulting in 40% hydrogen content in the biogas compared to the production levels in feed without cheese whey. Wang et al. [29] reported that co-anaerobic digestion favors the production of hydrogen, resulting in a balanced C/N ratio under optimal pH conditions. Gioannis et al. [4] reported that the substrate mixture is motivated by the simultaneous treatment of more than one residue, due to the dilution of toxic or inhibitory compounds, improving the conditions of production of hydrogen and the ratio of carbohydrate/protein. In light of these studies, a few authors have used substrate mixtures in fermentation reactions and have verified an improvement in the production of H2 [2,27,29,30]. Mohan et al. [30] evaluated the effect of substrate composition on the production of hydrogen. When the reactors were fed with only glucose, the authors reported yields of 0.0109 mmol H2 g−1 COD h−1. However, when they added substrates (i.e., glucose or sewage) to wastewater with chemicals, there was an increase to 0.0232 mmol H2 g−1 COD h−1. Wang et al. [29] investigated the effect of co-digestion of vinasse cassava and sewage sludge and found that the optimal substrate ratio was 3:1 (cassava stillage: sewage sludge), producing a yield of 74 mL g−1 SV, which decreased to 0 when the ratio was between 1:3 and 0:4. The present study obtained HY of 1.37 mmol H2 g−1 COD using only glucose as substrate. From the mixture of substrate, it was possible to increase to 1.7 mmol H2 g−1 COD, similar results to that of Rosales-Colunga et al. [2]. The authors evaluated the fermentation of different sugars (i.e., glucose and a mixture of glucose and galactose) on the hydrogen production in batch reactors. The results suggested that hydrogen production was affected by the type of sugar used. Using only glucose as a substrate, a yield of 0.3 mol H2 mol−1 glucose and a hydrogen production of 0.446 L d−1 h−1 were obtained. When a mixture of 50% glucose and 50% galactose was used, the yield increased to 1.02 mol H2 mol−1 hexose, and the hydrogen production increased to 0.586 L d−1 h−1. A number of studies have used substrate mixtures from lignocellulosic materials, which are difficult to break into smaller sugars [17,18]. As was observed in this work, the use of mixed substrates also favored the production of hydrogen, when compared using glucose as an individual substrate. This observation is correlated by Prakasham et al. [18], who investigated the relationship of glucose and xylose in the production of hydrogen. When the co-substrate was fed to a reactor, there was an increase in the production of hydrogen, resulting in a maximum 1900 mL H2 when using a feed concentration of 5000 mg L−1 of 40% glucose and 60% xylose. Table 4 presents a few of the studies that have used glucose mixed with other substrates and that have reported similar results as this current study. These studies used batch reactors to treat glucose with xylose [17,18], glucose and galactose [2] and have shown that different ratios of substrates affect the hydrogen yield. Even with different reactors and operating conditions, the same pattern of behavior was observed, indicating that the substrate mixtures are a preferable carbon source compared with glucose. Table 5 shows the main soluble metabolites found in the reactors AFBR1 and AFBR2. With the reduction of glucose in the feed medium, the percentage of butyric acid increased from 5% to 13% (AFBR1) and from 3% to 9% (AFBR2). Acetic acid reached maximum values of 16% (AFBR1) and 11% (AFBR2). Ethanol and methanol are the predominant metabolites, with maxima of 42% and 50% for AFBR1 and 47% and 54% for AFBR2. The highest percentages of phase 1 HAc (15% and 10%) led to a dominant acid metabolic pathway. Davila-Vazquez et al. [7] suggested that lactose fermentation produced 8 mol of hydrogen, as shown in Eq. (2). (2) C12H24O12 + 5H2O → 4CH3COOH + 4CO2 + 8H2 The production of acetate and butyrate during fermentation is also associated with high hydrogen yields. Eq. (3) shows a potential metabolic pathway [31]. (3) C6H12O6 → 2H2 + 2CO2 + (1/2) CH3COOH + (3/4) CH3(CH2)2COOH With an increased ratio of cheese whey to other phases, ethanol fermentation was favored, inducing a metabolic pathway with the concomitant production of hydrogen and ethanol (Eq. (1)). It was shown that increases in butyric acid correspond with increases in cheese whey. Fig. 3 compares HY with ethanol yield (EtOHY) in the three phases for the AFBR1 and AFBR2 reactors. EtOHY increased with an increasing proportion of cheese whey in the feed medium. A maximum of 2.83 mmol EtOH g−1 COD in phase 3 (100% cheese whey) was obtained for AFBR1 (Fig. 3(a)). This same behavior was observed for the AFBR2 reactor (Fig. 3(b)), which also achieved a maximum of 3.45 mmol EtOH g−1 COD in phase 3. For phases 1 and 2, the ethanol yields were always lower than those of hydrogen for both reactors. However, for phase 3 the ethanol yields were always higher than those of hydrogen. Therefore, a substrate mixture of glucose and cheese whey favored the production of ethanol. When compared with glucose fermentation, ethanol yields were 1.75 (AFBR1) and 1.93 (AFBR2) factors greater. This was also observed by Rosales-Colunga et al. [2]; a mixture of glucose and galactose produced 3.67 factors greater ethanol production relative to glucose-only feeds. High concentrations of ethanol concomitant with hydrogen production were also observed in the fermentation of molasses [11,32] and glucose [21,23]. The presence of ethanol can also reduce excessive acidity in the reactor, leading to an increased efficiency in the production of H2 [32]. When evaluating the effect of different support materials on the production of hydrogen in AFBRs, Barros and Silva [21] obtained yields of approximately 3.6 mmol H2 g−1 COD with polystyrene as support material, and an HRT of 6 h. A similar yield was obtained in this work, even with different operating conditions and substrates. To evaluate the effects of using different inocula, the sludge from a poultry slaughterhouse (AFBR2) exhibited the highest potential ethanol yield of 3.45 mmol EtOH g−1 COD and HY of 1.7 mmol H2 g−1 COD (Phase 3)."
8,Hydrogen production and soluble microbial products in the fermentation of cheese whey,"3.3 Hydrogen production and soluble microbial products in the fermentation of cheese whey In the fermentation of cheese whey, the average results for AFBR1 and AFBR2 were, respectively: H2 content of 28.2% and 23.2%, HPR of 2.88 L d−1 L−1 and 2.88 L d−1 L−1, and HY of 1.27 mol H2 mol−1 lactose (1.9 mmol H2 g−1 COD) and 1.1 mol H2 mol−1 lactose (1.6 mmol H2 g−1 COD) in AFBR1 and AFBR2, respectively. Thus, the use of this individual carbon source for microbial growth resulted in the stable HY and biogas content of 1.27 mol H2 mol−1 lactose and 28%, respectively, in AFBR1 (sludge swine). These values were higher than those obtained for AFBR2 (sludge poultry slaughterhouse). Both reactors also achieved high HPR of 2.88 L d−1 L−1. Table 6 presents a few studies in the literature using only cheese whey as the carbon source. The use of cheese whey as the substrate in fermentative hydrogen production was studied in fixed bed reactors [13], UASBs [12], CSTRs [10,33] and batch reactors [7]. Different parameters were tested: the organic loading rate [10,13,15], the effect of HRT [10,15], different formulations of bacteria growth medium [7] and different inoculation structures [12]. The maximum HY in this study was 1.27 mol mol−1 lactose and the maximum HPR was 2.88 L d−1 L−1, which are in agreement with results reported by Perna et al. [13] who obtained a yield of 1.1 mol mol−1 lactose at an applied HRT of 24 h. Thus, the results are considered comparable with previous studies reported in the literature, demonstrating the potential of cheese whey as a substrate in the fermentative production of hydrogen using AFBRs. The composition of the main soluble metabolites is shown in Fig. 4 . There was a predominance of ethanol (35%) in both reactors, followed by methanol (34% and 33%), butyric acid (13% and 11%) and acetic acid (5% and 6%) for AFBR1 and AFBR2, respectively. The results suggest ethanol fermentation, as shown by Eq. (1), yields 2.48 mmol EtOH g−1 COD (AFBR1) and 2.35 mmol EtOH g−1 COD (AFBR2). It was observed that there was no significant difference in the compositions of metabolites, even between different inocula. The use of cheese whey for the production of ethanol has already been reported in the literature by Ozmihci and Kargi [34] who evaluated the influence of the HRT (17.6–64.4 h) on ethanol production. Linearly increasing ethanol concentrations and an HRT of up to 50 h, resulted in a maximum yield of 0.54 g EtOH g−1 lactose. Carrillo-Reyes et al. [12] also reported ethanol as a major soluble metabolite from the use of cheese whey."
9,Comparison of the HY and EtOHY in AFBR1 and AFBR2,"3.4 Comparison of the HY and EtOHY in AFBR1 and AFBR2 Fig. 5 compares HY (Fig. 5(a)) and EtOHY (Fig. 5(b)) from glucose, the best rate of mixture glucose and cheese whey (phase 3), and cheese whey, for the AFBR1 and AFBR2 reactors. The fermentation of glucose resulted in low HY (0.9 and 1.37 mmol H2 g−1 COD). A high HY (1.6 and 1.7 mmol H2 g−1 COD) was attained using glucose plus cheese whey. The yield of this fermentation was similar values as that of cheese whey (1.9 and 1.6 mmol H2 g−1 COD). From different carbon sources, the inocula had different behaviors for HY. Using glucose as substrate, the sludge from a UASB reactor which treated poultry slaughterhouse wastewater had a highest potential. Conversely, from the use of only cheese whey, sludge from a UASB reactor used in the treatment of swine wastewater had greatest potential, showing the difference between the inocula were evident from the use of different carbon source. From the use of the mixture, the same pattern of behavior was observed between both inocula. High concentrations of ethanol were obtained from all substrates. Interestingly, in the fermentation of glucose plus cheese whey the highest production of ethanol (2.83 and 3.45 mmol EtOH g−1 COD) were attained. When compared with glucose fermentation, ethanol yields were 1.75 (AFBR1) and 1.93 (AFBR2) factors greater. In comparison to cheese whey as substrate, ethanol yields were 1.13 (AFBR1) and 1.75 (AFBR2) factors greater, showing the substrate mixture improved the production of ethanol. To evaluate the effects of using different inocula, the sludge from a poultry slaughterhouse exhibited the highest potential ethanol yield of 3.45 mmol H2 g−1 COD, when compared with sludge from a UASB reactor used in the treatment of swine wastewater."
10,Conclusions,"This work demonstrated the feasibility of anaerobic fluidized bed reactors for the production of hydrogen and ethanol from different carbon sources. The maximum HYs were 1.37 and 1.9 mmol H2 g−1 COD to fermentation of glucose and cheese whey, respectively. The co-fermentation of the glucose and cheese whey mixture indicated that it is possible to have the simultaneous production of hydrogen and ethanol with high yields of 1.7 mmol H2 g−1 COD and 3.45 mmol EtOH g−1 COD. Ethanol fermentation was dominant in this study."
