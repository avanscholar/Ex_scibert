0,Introduction,"Global growth in the magnesium market is expected to reach 1.2 Mt/y by 2020 (Magnesium Metal, 2016). Application of Mg has been limited by relatively high cost of production, associated energy costs and a low CO2 Avoidance Potential (CAP). The main environmental concerns to produce different types of MgO are the use of energy and emissions to air. The calcination process of magnesite is the principal user of energy and the main source of emissions, with 1.1 t CO2 resulting from the carbonate decomposition to produce 1 t of magnesia (MgO) (Sheila, 1993). MgO finds applications in refractories, low carbon cements (Hassan, 2014) and in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals (Devasahayam and Khangoankar, 1995, 2007). MgO is used in indirect carbon sequestration via conversion to Mg(OH)2 and subsequently to anhydrous MgCO3, the most desirable carbonated phase for aqueous sequestration, showing high efficiency and enhanced overall kinetics of storage (Atashin et al., 2017; Sheila and Khangoankar, 1989). Due to very low solubility MgCO3 is not very reactive and not the ideal candidate for the aqueous sequestration, until it is calcined to active MgO to subsequently produce Mg(OH)2 and MgCO3 for various applications (Sheila et al., 1991). Production of MgO from mineral magnesite accounts for direct CO2 emissions of 6.7 Mt from the calcination process alone. MgO is also produced from magnesium hydroxide Mg(OH)2 obtained from seawater or brine and thermal hydrolysis of hydrated MgCl2. The energy requirements for the calcination process route starting from MgCl2 are three times higher than those of the MgO production process starting from MgCO3 (dry process route). The incipient evolution of CO2 for magnesites occurs at 640 °C compared to 730 °C and 906 °C for dolomite and calcite, respectively (Esin et al., 1949). The process is endothermic, depends on a high firing temperature and is very energy intensive. Different types of magnesium oxide, varying in physico-chemical characteristics are processed at various temperatures. For example, sintered or dead burned magnesia (DBM) used for refractories is produced between 1600 and 2200 °C. Caustic calcined (CCM) finding application in agriculture and environmental protection industry are produced between 600 and 800 °C and fused magnesia used for special applications, such as for nuclear reactors is produced at 2800 °C. The energy demand for MgO production ranges between 6 and 12 GJ/t MgO. Fuel requirements to produce 1 t MgO are 6.8–12.1 GJ/t of natural gas, 240–393 kg/t of petroleum coke and 190–330 kg/t of fuel oil (European IPPC Bureau at the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies, 2010). Therefore, application of renewable energy or underutilised organic wastes as energy sources in the MgO production will offer substantial environmental benefits for the industry through reduction in the fossil fuel related CO2 emissions and other co-processing opportunities explored in this work. Energy use and emissions to air are key environmental issues in producing magnesium products. The existing literature on MgO production from magnesite do not explore the carbon avoidance as for every mole of MgO produced 1 mol of CO2 is produced. This study explores how to avoid or diminish the CO2 produced during the production of magnesium products using waste plastics and biomass feedstock which was never considered before. This study aims to investigate the effects of biomass and waste plastics or bio-renewable plastics (Yang et al., 2016) and any synergistic effects when combined, on the emission and energy intensive, high carbon footprint reaction, the thermal decomposition of MgCO3 to greatly reduce the CO2 emissions, thus increasing the CO2 Avoidance Potential (CAP) of the process. It is anticipated the application of biomass, bio-renewable plastics based resources and feedstock recycling of waste plastics to produce of MgO could slow the depletion rate of fossil reserves, unsustainable resource use and enable the development of a sustainable chemical industry (Devasahayam and Singh, 2016., Hirschnitz-Garbers et al., 2016)."
1,Materials and methods,A brief discussion on the materials and experimental techniques used in the present study are provided in this section.
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Various combinations by mass of MgCO3 mixed with epoxy resin, as a representative of the plastic waste or the bio-renewable epoxy resin and Radiata Pine (Pinus Radiata) as representative of the biomass were used as samples. The magnesium carbonate hydrate (MgCO3.xH2O), 40.0–43.5% magnesium (as MgO) basis, MW 84.31 as anhydrous basis was supplied by Sigma Aldrich (M7179-500G). ARALDITE® GY 191 CI Bisphenol A epoxy resin was supplied by Huntsman Advanced Materials (Australia) Pty Ltd. Composition of the resin was bisphenol A epoxy resin >60%; glycidyl ether of C12-C14 alcohols <30%; bisphenol F-epoxy resin <30%. The proximate and ultimate analysis of the plastic sample is shown in Table 1 . Pinus Radiata was used as a biomass sample. The sample was first dried under vacuum for 2 h at 80 °C and packed inside a furnace to the average density of 400 kg/m3. The proximate and ultimate analysis of the biomass sample are shown in Table 1. The cellulose content in Pinus Radiata is 42%, the lignin content in the matrix is 29% and hemicellulose content is 7%."
3,Experimental analysis of volatiles,"2.2 Experimental analysis of volatiles Each prepared sample was pyrolyzed isothermally at 1000 °C in an infrared image gold furnace and an arrangement of internals for heating of a packed bed of sample (Strezov and Evans, 2009). Samples varying in masses from 20 to 50 mg were manually packed inside the silica tube for each run. Then the glass tube with the sample was inserted into the center of a graphite heating element at 1000 °C. Helium gas controlled by a mass flow controller was passed through the sample as the carrier gas at a flow rate of ∼50 mL/min. The pyrolytic volatiles evolved from the biomass sample were analysed using an Microsensor Technology Incorporated Actinon M200 series micro gas chromatograph instrument. As the volatiles evolved during biomass pyrolysis mainly comprised of H2, CO, CO2, CH4 and other light volatiles, such as oxygen-containing compounds with a low carbon number, a calibration gas mixture of 3% CO, 3% CO2, 1% CH4, 1% C2H4, 1% C2H6, and 1% H2 in ultrahigh pure argon was used to calibrate the instrument prior to the experiment. During the experiment, the off-gas from the reactor was first condensed in an ice–water coil to remove moisture and condensable organic volatiles before being subjected to the micro GC for analysis. The GC equipped with thermal conductivity detectors consisted of a molecular sieve 5 A column heated at 60 °C was used to determine H2 and CO, while a Poraplot U column, kept at 40 °C, was used to measure CO2, CH4, C2H4 and C2H6. The evolution rate of each gas species was obtained as a mass percent of the initial sample mass per minute."
4,X-ray diffraction (XRD),"2.3 X-ray diffraction (XRD) In a separate experiment, the structural characterization of decomposed MgCO3 with epoxy resin at 1200 °C was carried out using XRD with Copper Kα source operated at 45 kV and 40 mA. Samples were scanned with a step size of 0.026° and a scan rate of 1°/min. Phase identification was carried out using X'pert High score software."
5,Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA),"2.4 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) Thermogravimetric analysis (TG, model: TGA/DSC 1 STARe System, Mettler Toledo Ltd.) of epoxy and MgCO3 was carried out while continuously heating from room temperature to 1000 °C at the rate of 30 °C/min in high-purity nitrogen as the carrier gas at 20 mL/min. The obtained TG curve was processed to produce a differential thermogravimetric (DTG) curve."
6,Results,"Table 2 shows the details of the sample compositions, sample masses and the cumulative gas compositions of isothermal pyrolysis of samples at 1000 °C for each experiment. In Table 3 the actual gas composition, y, is presented and includes the expected gas composition, x, calculated based on the mass % of different components (MgCO3, biomass, and epoxy) present in each sample. Table 3 also shows the correlation between the actual gas composition vs the expected gas composition whether positive or negative. Table 3 shows a 95% reduction in CO2 composition when the magnesite is calcined in presence of epoxy resin (Tests 5 and 6). When MgCO3 was pyrolyzed in presence of biomass (Test 4), 82% reduction was achieved of the expected CO2 emissions from the calcination reaction. During the same process substantial increase in CH4, H2 and hydrocarbons was noticed. In presence of biomass and epoxy resin (Test 6), where epoxy resin is close to twice the MgCO3 mass, the achieved reduction in CO2 emission was close to 99%, accompanied by increased amounts of H2 (∼460% than expected). However, when the epoxy resin amount was decreased by half, and roughly made equal to the MgCO3 amount in presence of biomass (Test 7), significant amount of H2 (4784% than expected) was produced. It would appear CH4 (Test 4) could be contributing to the larger amounts of H2 as CH4 emissions are greatly reduced under these conditions. One can assume the presence of epoxy could suppress CH4 contributed by the biomass and aid the formation of H2, while at the same time, due to reduced amounts of epoxy resin, there is only ∼77% reduction in CO2 emissions. The XRD spectrum of thermally decomposed MgCO3 (Fig. 1 ) shows presence of MgO phase only indicating total decomposition. To calculate the dependence of CH4, CO2, and H2 on the amount of biomass, epoxy resin and MgCO3, as well as to see the interdependency on the other gases, multiple, nonlinear regression analyses were carried out. Correlation between the individual gas composition and the sample masses (Equation (1)) and the correlation between the individual gas composition and the other gases in the mixture as well as the sample masses (Equation (2)) were determined. C1 and C2 are the constants and X1 to X11 are the regression coefficients of the variables in Equations (1) and (2). (1) Exp(Y1) = C1 + X1[epoxy]+X2 [MgCO3] + X3[biomass] For CO2, the values of C1, X1, X2, X3 in Equation (1) are 2.28 × 1028, −2.1 × 1027, 1.95 × 1027 and −8 × 1026 respectively. For H2, the values of C1, X1, X2, X3 in Equation (1) are 499.5, 20.55, 96.74 and −7.09 respectively. For CH4, the values of C1, X1, X2, X3 in Equation (1) are 0.377, 0.19, −0.38 and 0.5 respectively. It is interesting to note that MgCO3 and the epoxy resin show positive correlation for H2 production while the biomass shows negative correlation under the experimental conditions of 1000 °C. This is perhaps due to catalytic effect of alkali and alkali earth carbonates on Boudouard reaction (reaction 7) and in enhancing the pyrolysis as discussed in section 3.2. Positive and higher coefficient values are exhibited for biomass for CH4 production compared to the epoxy. MgCO3 shows positive correlation to CO2 production, while both epoxy and biomass show negative correlation. (2) Exp(Y2) = C2 + X4[epoxy] + X5[MgCO3] + X6[biomass] + X7[CH4] + X8[C2H4] + X9 [C2H6] +.X10[H2] + X11[CO2] For CO2, the values of C1, X4, X5, X6, X7, X8, X9, and X10 in Equation (2) are 1.1 × 1028, −2.3 × 1027, 4.4 × 1027, −8.7 × 1026, 8.8 × 1027, −1.7 × 1029, 1.6 × 1029, and 1.3 × 1028 respectively. For H2, the values of C1, X4, X5, X6, X7, X8, X9, and X11 in Equation (2) are −1111.2, 105.0, −126.9, 76.7, −2172.88, 11290.6, −6523.0 and 38.43 respectively. For CH4, the values of C1, X4, X5, X6, X8, X9, X10 and X11 in Equation (2) are −6.5, 0.4, −0.2, 0.5, −7.6, 17.80, 0.6, and 0.14 respectively. H2 shows high dependency on CO2 and C2H4. CH4 shows high dependency on C2H6, H2 and CO2 while negative correlation to C2H4, and CO2 shows positive correlation to MgCO3. The results of TGA show a 60% reduction in mass for MgCO3 when the maximum temperature is set to 1000 °C (Fig. 2 ) to form MgO. The decomposition begins at 500 °C and is completed at ∼550 °C. The epoxy shows a 99% reduction in mass when the maximum temperature is set to 1000 °C. The decomposition begins at 174 °C and until 321 °C shows a sharp inflection as seen in the DTG trace. After 321 °C there is a steady decline (Fig. 2). Results of TGA of Radiata Pine in Fig. 2 show a sharp decline in mass around 285 °C until 396 °C and a steady decline after this temperature. Up to 15% residue at 1000 °C indicates char formation."
7,Energy and CO2 avoidance potential,"3.1 Energy and CO2 avoidance potential Table 4 lists the energy potential of the volatiles evolved during thermal decomposition of MgCO3 in the presence of biomass and epoxy resin. While the amounts of epoxy appear to greatly contribute to the increase in CAP (Test 5), use of biomass alone in the processing of MgCO3 has almost no positive contribution to the CAP, when the evolved volatiles are vented to the atmosphere (Test 4). However, the biomass contributes to higher energy potential mainly attributed to the evolution of CH4 and H2. When volatiles are combusted, the energy can be used to fuel the endothermic decomposition of MgCO3 while contributing to the increase in CAP between 66.8% (Test 4) and 99.7% (Test 5). So far, the existing literature has not explored the thermal decomposition of magnesium carbonate with the aim to address the high CO2 emissions. The present study confirms high net calorific value contribution to the reaction up to 16 MJ/kg organic matter, and a high CAP in the presence of polymers and biomass, compared to nil contribution to both the CAP and net calorific value when the calcination of MgCO3 is carried out without the biomass or plastics (Test 1)."
8,Pyrolysis of biomass,"3.2 Pyrolysis of biomass Pyrolysis of biomass in an inert atmosphere produces gaseous products, mainly CO2, H2, CO, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, benzene and other volatiles, liquid products and solid products (char). Depending on the thermal environment and the final temperature, pyrolysis yields mainly gases at temperatures greater than 800 °C with rapid heating rates. Fast pyrolysis yields 60% bio-oil and takes seconds for complete pyrolysis. In addition, it gives 20% biochar and 20% syngas (Zafar, 2009). The rapid pyrolysis at high temperature produces char during the devolatilization. The chars obtained at 1000 °C are more reactive than the chars obtained at 800 °C (Björnbom et al., 1991). Higher yields of char are favoured by high carbon content, low oxygen content, low H/C ratio and higher content of coke forming components, such as lignin (Björnbom et al., 1991). Higher pyrolysis temperatures favour cracking of the hydrocarbons in the gaseous products and thus increase the yield of H2 and CO, while decreasing the CO2 content in the gases (Vigouroux, 2001). During gasification of biomass up to 900 °C, in an inert environment and atmospheric pressure, cellulose contributes mostly to the release of CO, whereas hemicellulose contributes mostly to CO2, and lignin contributes to H2 and CH4 (Tchapda and Pisupati, 2014).The cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose contents of Pinus Radiata are 42%, 29% and 7% respectively. This would suggest the main gases evolved during the pyrolysis of biomass are CO, H2 and CH4 and CO2 to an extent attributed to a lower hemicellulose composition of Pinus Radiata. The reactions of biomass pyrolysis are listed below (3–11): (3) C + ½ O2 → CO; ΔH° = - 109 kJ/mol; (partial oxidation reaction) (4) C + O2 → CO2; ΔH° = - 390 kJ/mol; (complete oxidation reaction) (5) C + 2 H2 → CH4; ΔH° = - 71 kJ/mol; (hydrogasification reaction) (6) C + 2 H2O (g) → CO2 + 2 H2; ΔH° = 88 kJ/mol; and the Boudouard reaction: (7) C + CO2 →2 CO; ΔH° = 172 kJ/mol; (8) CO + H2O (g) → CO2 + H2; ΔH° = −41 kJ/mol; (water gas shift reaction) (9) CO + 3 H2 → CH4 + H2O (g); ΔH° = −205 kJ/mol; (reverse steam reforming reaction) (10) C + H2O (g) → CO + H2; ΔH° = 130 kJ/mol; (water gas reaction) (11) CHaOb + (2 - b) H2O → (0.5a +2 - b) H2 + CO2; (auto-thermal biomass gasification) Reactions 8–10 occur when steam is available during gasification (Kumar et al., 2009). Steam reforming of hydrocarbons yields a mixture of H2 and CO (syngas), followed by the water–gas shift conversion to produce H2 and CO2 which can be significantly improved in presence of Ni–alumina or Ni–silica/alumina formulations with Ca and or K (Demirbas, 2002). The biomass pyrolysis products hydrogen and CO reported in the existing literature are not observed during the pyrolysis of biomass alone in the present study (Test 2). CH4 and H2 evolution are not as pronounced as expected in Test 2 when the biomass alone is pyrolyzed indicating perhaps a slow or an incomplete decomposition of lignin which is favoured at high temperatures. As hemicellulose and cellulose decompose, CO2 and CO should be evident in the pyrolysis product. As the hemicellulose content was relatively low compared to the cellulose in Pinus Radiata, it is expected that the CO produced should be greater than the amount of CO2 in Test 2. However, CO2 is the only gas prominent in the pyrolysis products, perhaps derived from the decomposition of hemicellulose. The reverse reactions 7 and 16 could be contributing to the CO2 and methane from the CO generated from cellulose decomposition (Test 4). In addition, lignin and magnesium carbonate also contribute to evolution of methane and CO2 respectively. When the biomass is pyrolyzed in the presence of MgCO3, increasing H2 production is observed (Test 4). It is inferred that MgCO3 pyrolysis with biomass (Test 4) could also be governed by the reactions 5, 6, 8 and 11 in addition to either 17, 18 or 19. When MgCO3, epoxy resin and biomass are pyrolyzed together (Tests 6 and 7) a significant increase in H2 evolution is observed. The results for Test 4 show higher CH4 and lower H2 values compared to the results for Tests 6 and 7. However, in Tests 6 and 7, CH4 and CO2 content are greatly reduced while the H2 is increased indicating a complex interaction between reverse Boudouard reaction (reverse reaction 7) and the secondary reactions involving the hydrocarbons, expressed with reactions 13 and 16. Alkali earth carbonates, such as CaCO3 enhance the pyrolysis (Zuo et al., 2011), and it is expected that MgCO3 will have a similar effect. According to Nagase et al. (1999) alkali carbonates catalyze the reverse Boudouard reaction (reverse reaction 7) and magnesium carbonates can also be expected to catalyze the reverse Boudouard reaction. Baldauf-Sommerbauer et al. (2016) opined that reductively calcined MgO catalyzes the reverse water-gas shift reaction 8, but does not catalyze conversion of CO2 to CH4."
9,Pyrolysis of plastics,"3.3 Pyrolysis of plastics The thermodynamic calculations for the pyrolysis of plastics shows only two phases, solid carbon and the gas phase, in which two species, namely CH4 and H2 dominate and are stable thermodynamically at 1100 °C and confirmed experimentally with nitrogen as carrier gas (VOEST, 1997). The pyrolysis reactions of plastics include conversion of polymers into hydrocarbons (mainly CH4): (12) Polymers → Cn Hm (g); Decomposition of hydrocarbons into carbon and H2; (13) Cn Hm (g) → nC (s) + H2 (g); ΔH° = hydrocarbon dependent; (e.g. CH4 → C (s) + H2 (g); ΔH° = 75.6 kJ/mol); The hydrocarbon could also act as a sink for CO2 gas, producing CO and H2 (reaction 14) (14) CnHm (g) + nCO2 (g) → 2nCO (g) + H2 (g); The other reactions include reaction of water vapour with C produced from the cracking of CnHm: (15) H2O (g) + C (s) → H2 (g) + CO (g); (16) CH4 + CO2 → 2CO + 2H2; ΔH° = −247.3 kJ/mol (methane dry reforming); and the Boudouard reaction (reaction 7). The CO2 could result from the decomposition of carboxylic groups in epoxies. The yield of CO can be attributed mainly to the secondary reactions. At a higher heating rate, the yield of CO is much higher than the yield of CO2. The trend in the yields of CO and CO2 with increasing heating rate depends on the Boudouard reaction (reaction 7) (Efika et al., 2015). MgCO3 pyrolysis with epoxy (Test 5) may be governed by the reactions 12, 13, 14, 16, 18 and 19 and reverse reaction 7, while presence of both biomass and epoxy (Test 6) appears to be governed by reactions 5, 8, 12 13, 14, 16, 19 and reverse reaction 7. Test 7 could be governed by interaction between the reactions 6, 8 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19 and reverse reaction 7 leading to secondary reactions. The hydrocarbon could also act as a sink for CO2 gas, produced during the thermal decomposition of MgCO3 producing CO and H2, reactions 14 and 19. As the thermodynamically stable products are only C and H2, the CO produced could be consumed in other secondary reactions (VOEST, 1997). Baldauf-Sommerbauer et al. (2016) also reported significant decrease in the CO2 emission per unit MgCO3 in reductive calcination, e.g. H2, producing MgO, equal amounts of carbon monoxide and CO2 and H2O: (17) MgCO3 → MgO + CO2 (18) (a+b + c)MgCO3 + (b+ 4c)H2 → (a+b + c)MgO + aCO2 + bCO + cCH4+ (b+2c)H2O In the presence of carbon or char it can follow reaction 19: (19) MgCO3 + C → MgO + 2CO Reductive H2 atmosphere also significantly lowers the calcination temperature by more than 150 °C, compared to the calcination in a non-reducing atmosphere (Baldauf-Sommerbauer et al., 2016). In the presence of powerful reducing agent, decomposition of the carbonate is initiated by an intermolecular electron transfer from the reductant to the CO3 2− leading to CO formation given by reaction 19, accompanied by a decrease in the decomposition temperature (Nagase et al., 1999). In the present study the volatiles from the biomass and the epoxy resin, mainly the H2 and CH4 would present a reducing atmosphere during the calcination of MgCO3 favouring a lower calcination temperature."
10,Avoidance of harmful gases,"3.4 Avoidance of harmful gases Pyrolysis of waste thermoset and thermoplastics generate harmful gases. CH4, H2, CO, CO2 and other hydrocarbons emitted during pyrolysis, are used as resources in high temperature metallurgical processing. During pyrolysis of plastics, CH4 and H2 dominate at 1100 °C (VOEST, 1997). Electronic wastes with halogenated polymers release toxins during combustion, such as dioxins, HBr, polybrominated diphenylethers. Pyrolysis of these halogenated wastes at high temperature in the absence of oxygen or in an inert atmosphere lowers the emissions of polybrominated diphenylethers, resulting in dichlorination, generating carbon, H2, HCl, benzene and toluene but no dioxins (Nakanoh et al., 2001). Calcium carbonate can adequately control the release of some toxins, such as C6H6 and HBr, in addition to enhancing the pyrolysis (Zuo et al., 2011). It is expected that the use of magnesium carbonate with similar chemistry to that of calcium carbonate can help control the toxin emissions. Epoxy used in the present study in a viscous liquid form facilitates a liquid-solid-vapour reaction mechanism greatly enhancing the reaction efficiency due to intimate contact between the reactants, while other waste polymers or biomasses can facilitate only solid-vapour reactions with a lower reaction efficiency. The cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin content may vary between the biomass feedstock affecting the pyrolysis product. However, pyrolysis in an inert atmosphere in the temperature range studied and the presence of magnesium carbonate can lower the emissions and the air pollutants. Present study suggests it is possible to increase the overall CAP of carbothermic Mg production from MgO/MgCO3 and the dead burnt MgO production in presence of plastics and biomass offering synergistic effects. The current operating temperature of ∼1600 °C can be brought down by at least 100–200 °C due to the reducing gases produced by these additives enhancing the energy efficiency of the process. The process contributes to dematerialization using of waste materials, a diversion from landfill (Ewijk, and Stegemann, 2016). In addition, H2, the by-product of the present study, is a clean energy carrier. The large market and sharply rising prices in fossil fuels have stimulated great interest in alternative, cheaper means of hydrogen production towards hydrogen economy."
11,Conclusions,"A step change novel carbon avoidance method is presented in this work where CO2 produced during the high carbon footprint process is greatly reduced or completely consumed when carried out in presence of waste additives greatly increasing the CAP. While the CAP of thermal decomposition of MgCO3 is very low due to significant amounts of CO2 produced (1:1 MgO: CO2) during thermal decomposition, the present study shows that in presence of biomass and waste plastics the CO2 emissions can be greatly reduced while simultaneously producing H2, CH4 and hydrocarbons. It is to be noted that by controlling the ratios of MgCO3: biomass: epoxy, it is possible to obtain H2 enriched product. The study utilises waste plastics and renewable sources, such as biomass offering a sustainable solution for energy needs while minimizing the impacts of landfills on the environment. Potential reduction in process temperature offered by the reducing atmosphere in presence of H2 and CH4 will be the added advantage contributing to the process efficiency. The conditions for increasing the CO2 avoidance potential of the process up to 99% was established in this work with the added advantage of generation of H2 enriched gases contributing to hydrogen economy. This novel process reduces energy requirement and materials consumption. In addition, the use of magnesium carbonate can adequately control the toxin emissions during the pyrolysis of plastics and the biomass."
12,Recommendations,"The present study has used waste biomass and plastics as additives in the thermal decomposition of magnesium carbonate, a high carbon foot print and energy intensive reaction. The additives have greatly increased the CAP and the energy saving potential, while simultaneously producing hydrogen. In addition, there is also a potential reduction in reaction temperatures up to ∼100–200 °C. This study recommends: • using different polymer and biomass feedstock to increase the CAP and the energy saving potential of thermal decomposition of magnesite • using the polymers and the biomass feed stock to generate H2 enriched stream during thermal decomposition of magnesite potentially contributing to hydrogen economy. • using a reductive environment to reduce the calcination temperature contributing to more energy saving. • pyrolysis of the plastics and biomass in presence of magnesium carbonate to adequately control the toxic emissions. • Using magnesium carbonate as a high temperature, alkali-promoted catalyst finding applications in water-gas shift reaction due to its effect on reverse Boudouard reaction."
