0,Introduction,"Since the water splitting phenomenon over TiO2 electrode was discovered in 1972 [1], photocatalytic H2 production technique using semiconductors was thought as a promising approach to solving the current energy shortage [2–10]. Among them, TiO2 nanomaterial is the most extensively explored ultraviolt (UV) light-responsive photocatalyst owing to its exceptional physicochemical features including low cost, stability, easy availability and appropriate band alignment to the water splitting reaction. However, UV rays (λ < 400 nm) only account for ~4% of the total solar spectrum (AM1.5G), while visible light (λ = 400–800 nm) and infrared rays (λ > 800 nm) account for ~53% and ~43% [2], respectively. To maximize the use of naturally available sunlight, an ideal photocatalyst should enable the utilization of low energy photons in the visible (Vis) and/or near-infrared (NIR) regions for H2 production. Although great advances in extending the spectral responsive region of TiO2 have been progressed through various strategies such as ion modification [11], surface plasmon excitation [12,13], and dye sensitization [14,15], a few examples reported the clear demonstration of Vis-NIR- or NIR-light-responsive H2 production system [2,9]. Lead chalcogenides with multiple exciton generation, a process that a single photon induces more than one electron-hole pairs, can undergo efficient carrier multiplication (CM) in solar cells for attaining extraordinary photovoltaic conversion efficiency [16,17]. For instance, the hot electrons, generated by the photons with energy larger than the PbSe quantum dots (QDs) bandgap, were found to transfer to TiO2 through the PbSe/TiO2 interface [18]. In addition, the photosensitization of infrared-bandgap PbS QDs was observed on TiO2 since the hot electrons at higher PbS QDs excited states can inject into TiO2 even though the energy level of PbS QDs excited state is more positive than the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 [19–24]. Therefore, it can be conjectured that the hot electrons in higher PbS excited states can inject into the CB of TiO2 to initiate the photocatalytic reactions [25,26]. In 2011, PbS QDs were used as sensitizer to extend the CO2 photoreduction activity of Cu/TiO2 composite to orange part (λ = ~610 nm) [25]. More recently, it was found that the multiple exciton generation process of PbS QDs in a ZnO@PbS/GO composite can improve the H2 production activity under UV light irridiation [26]. However, the direct application of photoexcited hot charge carriers of PbS enabling Vis-NIR light harvesting for efficient H2 production has not been reported to the best of our knowledge. Herein, a novel PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite is constructed by using infrared-bandgap PbS nanocrystals (NCs) as sensitizer of Pt-loaded ultrafine anatase TiO2 nanotubes (NTs). The ultrafine TiO2 nanotubes (diameter <10 nm), which accumulate and wind into microspheres with an average diameter of ~3 μm, are fabricated through an alkali solution-assisted hydrothermal treatment followed by acid post-treatment and calcination processes using commercial TiO2 nanoparticles (P25) as raw material. After optimizing the component ratio, the resultant 5.0 wt% PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite achieves a H2 production activity of 813 μmol h−1 under UV–Vis–NIR light irradiation, which is ~2.2 times as that (375 μmol h−1) of the Pt-loaded ultrafine TiO2 nanotubes (Pt–TiO2). Furthermore, the PbS NCs can extend the activity of Pt–TiO2 to Vis-NIR region (λ = 420–1064 nm) and give a H2 production activity of 186 μmol h−1. This is a rare sample of ultrabroadband (UV–Vis–NIR) light-responsive H2 production system via infrared-bandgap material coupling with wide-bandgap semiconductor to the best of our knowledge. The charge separation processes and a possible mechanism of the PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite with efficient and unusual broadband-light-responsive H2 production feature are elucidated with the aid of various characterization techniques."
1,Experimental,
2,Material preparation,"2.1 Material preparation Ultrafine TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) were fabricated as follow: A H2O2 solution (8.0 mL, AR, 30%) was added into a NaOH solution (60 mL, 10 M) under magnetically stirring, and then commercial TiO2 nanoparticles (0.50 g, P25, Degussa) were added into the solution. After stirring for 30 min, the resultant mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless autoclave (volume of 85 mL), then kept at 160 °C for 2 h. The resulted product was washed three times using deionized water and ethanol to obtain the precursor, which was added into a HCl solution (3.0 M) to replace Na+ with H+ ions. After centrifugation, the product was washed with water and ethanol, dried in vacuum oven at 70 °C overnight, and then calcined at 500 °C for 3 h with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 to obtain the ultrafine TiO2 NTs. PbS/TiO2 nanocomposite was prepared using an in situ deposition process with cysteine as S source. Typically, the above ultrafine TiO2 (0.10 g) was dispersed into deionized water (100 mL) by sonication for 5 min, and then cysteine (7.5 mg) was added into the suspension which pH value was adjusted to 4.00 using HCl solution (0.10 M). After stirring for 1 h, Pb(NO3)3 solution (0.1 mL, 0.20 M) was mixed with the ultrafine TiO2 NTs’ suspension containing cysteine, and then stirred for 30 min. The obtained mixture was performed by rotary evaporation process and calcined at 500 °C for 3 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 in Ar atmosphere. The resultant product was purified with distilled water and ethanol, and dried at 70 °C overnight to obtain 5.0 wt% PbS/TiO2 nanocomposite. For comparison, various PbS/TiO2 nanocomposites with different PbS weight ratios were prepared through the same procedures but varying the addition amount of Pb(NO3)3 solution. In addition, the single PbS nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared using the same condition of 5.0 wt% PbS/TiO2 nanocomposite without adding the TiO2 NTs. If necessary, 1.0 wt% Pt cocatalyst was deposited on the above products (ultrafine TiO2 NTs, PbS NPs and PbS/TiO2 nanocomposites) through photodeposition process [8,9]. Briefly, a sample (0.60 mg) was added into a methanol-water solution (200 mL, 20 vol%) containing H2PtCl6 solution (0.40 mL, 0.077 M). After ultrasonic treatment for 30 min, the suspension was irradiated using a 500 W Hg-lamp for 3 h under continuous stirring. The product was separated by centrifugation, and then washed several times with distilled water and dried at 70 °C overnight to obtain 1.0 wt% Pt-loaded ultrafine TiO2 NTs, PbS NPs and PbS/TiO2 nanocomposites, which was denoted as Pt–TiO2, Pt–PbS and Pt-(PbS/TiO2), respectively. Also, PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite was prepared through the same procedures using the 1.0 wt% Pt–TiO2 replacing the TiO2 NTs."
3,Material characterization,"2.2 Material characterization Crystal phases of the products were analyzed using a Bruker D8-Avance X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 0.154056 nm) at 40 kV, 40 mA and a scan rate of 4° min−1. The morphology was observed on a Zeiss-Sigma field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), and the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was performed at 200 kV on a field-emission electron microscope (JEM2100-HR) with an ultra-high-resolution pole piece. Liquid N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K were measured by a Micrometrics ASAP 2010 system. Elemental compositions were detected using a Bruker S4 Pioneer X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer with a Rh target and without standard sample. UV–Vis diffuse reﬂectance absorption spectra (DRS) were recorded at ambient temperature on a Shimadzu UV-3600 with BaSO4 as the reference. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were determined using Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectra (TRPS) were obtained on a FES920 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Edinburgh Instruments). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) was measured on a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectroscope equipped with a standard and monochromatic source (Al Kα) operated at 300 W and calibrated with C 1s. Transient photocurrent curves and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained using a CHI Model 618C electrochemical analyzer and a standard three-electrode system, whereby Pt wire, Pt plate and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) acted as the work, counter and reference electrode, respectively. The work electrode was prepared by depositing photocatalyst suspension containing Nafion solution (0.20 mL, 4.0 g L−1) on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (1.0 cm2), which was heated at 70 °C for 1 h to volatilize the solvent and steady the catalyst. In a typical run, the three electrodes were immersed into a suspension containing Na2SO4 solution (1.0 M) and 3.0 mg methyl viologen (MV) as electron media, which was continuously purged by N2 flow for 30 min before irradiation. For the measurement of flat-band potential (E fb), the film electrode was prepared on a clean FTO glass as follows: The sample (10 mg) was uniformly mixed with a mixed solvent (0.5 mL) containing alcohol, α-terpineol and hydroxyethyl cellulose under grind and sonication for 60 min, and then the resultant paste was spread onto the FTO glass (1.0 cm2). After air-drying and calcination at 300 °C for 1 h in an Ar atmosphere, the film electrode was used as working electrode for the electrochemical testing in the Na2SO4 solution (1.0 M) with various frequencies and different step sizes. Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl solution, E θ = 0.198 V vs. NHE) was used as reference electrode and Pt foil as counter electrode, and the E fb value was determined by the Mott-Schottky relation [9]."
4,Photoactivity measurement,"2.3 Photoactivity measurement Photocatalytic reaction was performed in a home-made reaction system. Typically, photocatalyst (50 mg) was dispersed in 50 mL of aqueous solution containing Na2SO3 (0.25 M) and Na2S (0.35 M). Long-wavelength pass filter (λ ≥ 420 nm) is equipped on a 300 W Xe-lamp to get the Vis-NIR light irradiation. Before irradiation, the photoreaction system was sonicated for 5 min to let the photocatalyst disperse uniformly, and then irradiated after thoroughly removing air. The H2 production reaction activity was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC, SP6890, TCD detector, 5 Å molecular sieve columns and Ar carrier). Similarly, the H2 production activity under monochromatic light irradiation obtained from band-pass filter was determined under the same photoreaction condition. A calibrated Si photodiode (SRC-1000-TC-QZ-N, Oriel) was used to measure the intensity of monochromatic light (λ = 350, 365, 380, 400, 420, 450, 475, 500, 550, 600, 700, 760, 785, 850, 950 and 1064 ± 10 nm), which is 72.44, 67.47, 56.25, 22.31, 5.77, 11.31, 10.34, 13.2, 11.13, 2.39, 3.06, 2.39, 2.23, 2.02, 1.75 and 1.03 mW cm−2, respectively. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) is calculated according to the equation as follows [2,10]: AQY ( % ) = 2 × number of evolved H 2 molecules number of incident photons × 100"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Crystal phase and composition analyses,"3.1 Crystal phase and composition analyses The ultrafine TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) exhibit a X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern with diffraction peaks at 2θ = 25.3°, 36.9°, 37.8°, 38.6°, 48.0°, 53.9°, 55.1°, 62.7° and 68.8° (Fig. 1 ), corresponding to the reflections of (101), (103), (004), (112), (200), (105), (211), (204) and (116) planes of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS No. 21–1272) [27–29], respectively. No rutile or brookite phase can be observed from the XRD pattern, suggesting the rutile phase in the P25 nanoparticles was completely transferred into anatase during the material preparation processes [29]. Although the 1.0 wt% PbS/TiO2 nanocomposite exhibits no diffraction peak of PbS, more and more intensive peaks along with enhancing the PbS-loading contents are observed at 2θ = 26.0°, 30.1°, 43.1°, 51.0°, 53.4°, 62.5° and 68.9° (Fig. 1), which can be due to the reflections of (111), (200), (220), (311), (222), (400) and (331) planes of cubic PbS (JCPDS No. 05–0592) [30–32], respectively. Elemental analysis results indicate that the Pt-loaded ultrafine anatase TiO2 NTs (Pt–TiO2) has a Ti:O atomic ratio of 1:2, equal to the theoretical stoichiometric ratio of TiO2 (Table 1 ). Also, those PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposites have Ti:O and Pb:S atomic ratios similar to the TiO2 NTs and PbS NPs, respectively. Moreover, PbS and Pt weight ratios in those PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposites are basically approximate to their respective initial addition contents during the material preparation process, suggesting that the cubic PbS nanocrystals (NCs) with high crystallinity are successfully deposited on the ultrafine TiO2 NTs. The FESEM image (Fig. 2 a) displays that the obtained TiO2 product has porous microsphere-like morphology with diameters in the range of 0.2–7 μm and an average diameter of ~3 μm, which are constructed by accumulation and winding of long fibrous nanostructures with hundreds of nanometers (Fig. 2b–d). The HRTEM image (inset in Fig. 2d) shows that those long fibrous nanostructures are ultrafine nanotubes with diameter smaller than 10 nm, which can be ascribed to the anatase TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) according to the XRD results. Although the microsphere-like morphology can be maintained after loading with PbS NCs as shown in the FESEM images (Fig. S1), the PbS-loading content has obvious effect on the surface microstructutres (Fig. 3 a–d). Due to the low content, 1.0 wt% PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite shows a microsphere-like morphology (Fig. 3a), which is very similar to that of the ultrafine TiO2 NTs. Along with enhancing the PbS-loading content, more and more additional nanoparticles can be observed on those TiO2 NTs of the microsphere (Fig. 3b–d). Moreover, 1.0 wt%, 3.0 wt% and 5.0 wt% PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposites have PbS NCs uniformly dispersed on those nanotubes without obvious aggregates (Fig. 3a–c), while the 10 wt% PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite contains obvious aggregated PbS nanoparticles (NPs), which almost fully cover the microsphere surfaces (Fig. 3d). The TEM image (Fig. 3e) of the 5.0 wt% PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite shows that those PbS NCs are uniformly dispersed on the nanotubes with an average size of ~30 nm (Figs. S2a and b), which is slightly smaller than that (~35 nm) of the single PbS NPs derived from the same preparation condition of the 5.0 wt% PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite (Figs. S2c and d). From the HRTEM image (Fig. 3f), some smaller PbS NCs (as shown in those red cycles) are found to closely attach on those nanotubes. The PbS NCs attached on the TiO2 NTs have an average diameter of ~1.5 nm (Fig. S2e) as calculated from the HRTEM image (Fig. S2f). Moreover, the d-spacing (ca. 0.342 nm) of the NCs’ lattice fringes (as shown in the white square in Fig. 3f) can be assigned to the (111) planes of cubic PbS, while the nanotube lattice fringes with d-spacing of 0.350 nm can be due to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2. In addition, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) pattern (inset in Fig. 3f) demonstrates that the NCs attached on nanotubes are cubic PbS, while the FFT pattern (inset in Fig. 3e) indicates those nanotubes are tetragonal anatase TiO2. These results demonstrate that the PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite has intimate contacts at the interfaces of those PbS NCs and TiO2 NTs. It is believed that this microstructure enables the PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite to utilize the low energy photons since an intimate contact between PbS QDs and TiO2 can improve the hot electrons transfer from the PbS excited states to TiO2 [23]. Both of the ultrafine TiO2 NTs and 5.0 wt% PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite exhibit similar typical type IV isotherms (Fig. S3a) with Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas (S BET) of 157 and 165 m2 g−1, respectively. It should be mentioned that the S BET of TiO2 NTs is not only much higher than that (~42 m2 g−1) of P25 nanoparticles, but also larger than that of the TiO2 nanotubes self-assembled film (100 m2 g−1) and the sea urchin-like TiO2 microspheres (97 m2 g−1) reported [30,33]. Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution plots (Fig. S3b) shows that the TiO2 NTs and PbS/(Pt–TiO2) exhibit very similar bimodal pore size distributions with a smaller portion of mesopores (centered at ~2.4 nm) due to those ultrafine nanotubes and a larger one (centered at ~9.7 nm) due to the network-like porous structure. However, P25 shows smaller distribution peaks centered at ~10 and ~21 nm. The broader pore size distribution and larger surface areas of PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite would be a benefit to the uniform distribution of PbS NCs."
7,Photocatalytic performance analyses,"3.2 Photocatalytic performance analyses Under UV–Vis–NIR light irradiation, the PbS NPs exhibits no activity for H2 production, while the TiO2 NTs and 5.0 wt% PbS/TiO2 nanocomposite without Pt-loading deliver very low H2 production activity of 26 and 58 μmol h−1 (Fig. 4 a), respectively. Although the 1.0 wt% Pt-loading on the PbS NPs only results in a trace H2 production activity of 16 μmol h−1, which can be due to the rapid charge recombination [26], the 1.0 wt% Pt-loaded TiO2 NTs (Pt–TiO2) exhibits an obviously enhanced activity of 375 μmol h−1. Moreover, the 5.0 wt% PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite delivers an activity up to 813 μmol h−1, which is 2.2 times as high as that of the Pt–TiO2. Under Vis-NIR light (λ ≥ 420 nm) irradiation, however, the Pt–TiO2 and Pt–PbS shows no activity for H2 production, and those PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposites achieve obvious H2 production activity (Fig. 4b). With enhancing the PbS-loading content from 1.0 wt% to 5.0 wt%, the activity of PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposites rapidly increases to a maximum (186 μmol h−1), and then slightly declines upon further enhancing to 10 wt%. It is reasonable in terms of the competitive relation between the light harvesting and the active sites for H2 production [2]. Also, the Pt-loading content shows obvious influence on the activity of 5.0 wt% PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite (Fig. S4), and 1.0 wt% Pt loading on the TiO2 NTs delivers an optimal H2 evolution activity (186 μmol h−1). The enhancement in activity along with increasing the Pt-loading content can be attributed to the loaded Pt nanoparticles acting as co-catalyst on the ultrafine TiO2 NTs, which benefits the photogenerated charge separation for H2 evolution, while excessive Pt loading results in those Pt nanoparticles growing and densely distributed on the TiO2 NTs, which would absorb and scatter the incident photons, and thus weaken the co-catalyst function for H2 evolution. In addition, the 1.0 wt% Pt-loaded PbS/TiO2 nanocomposites (Pt-(PbS/TiO2) delivers a similar increasing trend along with enhancing the PbS-loading contents (Fig. 4b). Nevertheless, the activity (186 μmol h−1) of 5.0 wt% PbS/(Pt–TiO2) is much better than that (163 μmol h−1) of 5.0 wt% Pt-(PbS/TiO2). It indicates that an optimal PbS-loading content on the TiO2 NTs (or Pt–TiO2) is 5.0 wt%, and those PbS NCs can effectively promote the H2 production when combining with Pt co-catalyst even though its deposition sequence and position would influence the activity. Compared with the PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite, some Pt nanoparticles would be also located around PbS NCs in the Pt-(PbS/TiO2) nanocomposite, which might debase the efficient electron transfer from PbS to TiO2 [27,28], and then the photoactivity as discussed below. The wavelength-dependent AQY curves (Fig. 5 a) indicate that the 5.0 wt% PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite has unussal broadband-light-harvesting feature in the UV–Vis–NIR region (λ = 350–1064 nm) with AQY of 38.6%, 26.2%, 8.35%, 2.43%, 3.21%, 2.17%, 0.36%, 0.11% and 0.01% illuminated at 350, 420, 450, 550, 700, 760, 850, 950 and 1064 nm monochromatic light, respectively. In addition, the AQY summations of Pt–PbS and Pt– TiO2 under various UV monochromatic lights (λ = 350, 365, 380 and 400 nm) are much lower than the corresponding AQY values of PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite, implying there exists a synergetic effect when PbS NCs are incorporated with Pt–TiO2. Obviously, this result is a rare sample that the infrared-bandgap PbS NCs enable to robustly extend the H2 production activity of anatase TiO2 to Vis-NIR region, which is much longer than that (~610 nm) of PbS QDs-sensitized Cu/TiO2 reported previously [25], and thus demonstrates a realistic approach for harnessing larger portions of solar spectrum in a H2 production system. The 5.0 wt% PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite also exhibits relatively good stability in the three consecutive runs as shown in Fig. 5b. As seen, an average H2 production activity of 166 μmol h−1 is achieved in the first run of 5 h photoreaction, which then slightly reduces to 150 and 140 μmol h−1 in the second and third runs, respectively. This slight deactivation might be due to the photooxidation of the infrared-bandgap PbS NCs like the situation of PbS QDs-sensitized TiO2 [25]. To make it more clear, the surface chemical compositions and valence states of the 5.0 wt% PbS/(Pt-AMS) nanocomposite before and after the 15 h photoreaction were further characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The survey spectra (Fig. S5a) of the PbS/(Pt–TiO2) and its recovered one suggest the presence of Ti, O, Pb, S and Pt elements. The Ti 2p high-resolution spectra (Fig. 6 a) exhibit two peaks with binding energies (BE) of 458.2 (Ti 2p3/2) and 463.9 (Ti 2p1/2) eV, indicating the valence state of Ti is +4 [28]. Also, the S 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 6b) can be deconvoluted into two symmetrical be peaks at 160.9 (S 2p3/2) and 162.1 (S 2p1/2) eV, indicating that the S2− oxidation state is present [9,33]. The regional spectra of Ti 2p and S 2p for the recovered product show no obvious peak shift, demonstrating its relatively good stability during the photoreaction process. Nevertheless, the Pb 4f regional spectra (Fig. 6c) show obvious differences, and the original PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite shows two symmetrical BE peaks of 136.7 (Pb 4f7/2) and 141.6 (Pb 4f7/2) eV [25], while the recovered product exhibits extra peaks located at 137.3 and 142.2 eV. This higher-energy features in XPS spectra can be due to Pb–O adducts such as PbO or Pb(OH)2 resulted from the photocorrosion of PbS [25,34,35]. It can be confirmed by the O 1s regional spectra (Fig. 6d), where the new peak at 532.2 eV observed from the recovered product is also due to Pb–O adducts in the form of PbO or Pb(OH)2 [34,35], and the same peaks of 530.0 and 531.3 eV as the original one can be assigned to O2− ions in the anatase lattice and surface –OH groups [28,36], respectively. Since the SO3 2−/S2− are used as sacrificial reagent to initiate the oxidation reaction of VB holes in PbS NCs, the slight deactivation of PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite might relate to the excessively consuming of the sacrificial reagent during each run of photoreaction, which leads to slight photocorrosion of PbS NCs by its accumulated VB holes. In addition, the PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite and its recovered one exhibit very similar XRD pattern (Fig. S5b), also demonstrating its relatively good stability during the photoreaction process."
8,Energy band structure and mechanism analyses,"3.3 Energy band structure and mechanism analyses To explore the role of PbS NCs in extending the spectral responsive region for H2 production over the Pt–TiO2, the energy band structures of PbS/(Pt–TiO2) were further investigated. The TiO2 NTs presents an onset absorption edge at ~393 nm (Fig. 7 a), while the PbS NPs show a broadband absorption due to its infrared-bandgap feature. Although the TiO2 NTs has no absorption above its absorption edge (~400 nm), the PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposites show broad absorption ability in the Vis-NIR region (400–1200 nm), which shows an increasing trend with enhancing the PbS-loading content. It means that the surface electric charge of TiO2 NTs can be enhanced possibly due to the electron transition of PbS to TiO2 [19–24], which is a benefit to efficient utilization of Vis-NIR light as shown in Fig. 5a. The bandgap energy (E g) of PbS NPs and TiO2 NTs can be estimated to be ~0.78 and ~3.10 eV according to the related curves of (αhν)2 (for indirect bandgap PbS) and (αhν)1/2 (for direct bandgap TiO2) νs. photon energy (hν) as showed in Fig. S6a. The Mott-Schottky plots indicate that the TiO2 NTs have positive slopes and the same intercept with x-axis (Fig. S6b), suggesting that the TiO2 NTs is n-type semiconductor with a flat-band potential (E fb) of −0.57 V vs. Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl solution, E θ = 0.198 V vs. NHE) [37–39]. Since the CB bottom (E CB) is usually more negative by ca. −0.1 V than the E fb for n-type semiconductors, the E CB of TiO2 NTs can be estimated to be −0.47 V, and thus its VB top (E VB) can be calculated to be +2.63 V according to the formula (E VB = E g + E CB) [37,38]. Similarly, the Mott−Schottky plots of PbS NPs indicate that the E fb value is −0.41 V vs. Ag/AgCl, and thus its E CB and E VB can be estimated to be ca. −0.31 and + 0.47 V vs. NHE, respectively. On the bases of the above results, a potential energy diagram of the PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite can be drawn as Fig. 7b. As seen, although the CB bottom of PbS NCs is below that of the TiO2 NTs, the H2 production can be really initiated by the Vis-NIR monochromatic lights (λ = 420–1064 nm, Fig. 5a). It implies that the band-edge excitation of PbS NCs is not expected to directly cause the charge injection into TiO2 [19,22,25], and the photoexcitation to higher energy states of PbS NCs is therefore necessary for the charge separation of PbS NCs to initiate the H2 production. Namely, only those hot electrons at the PbS excited states that are higher than the CB bottom as shwon in Fig. 7b, generated by photons with energies above the PbS NCs’ bandgap [18], can transfer to the CB of the TiO2 NTs. The single 1.0 wt% Pt-loaded PbS NPs (Pt–PbS) only gives a trace H2 production activity (16 μmol h−1) under UV–Vis–NIR light irradiation (Fig. 4a), far lower than that (813 μmol h−1) of 5.0 wt% PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite with the same Pt-loading content, which can be due to the severe recombination of photogenerated hot charge carriers in the PbS NPs. On the other hand, the PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite delivers a photoactivity (186 μmol h−1) higher than that (163 μmol h−1) of the Pt-(PbS/TiO2) nanocomposite under Vis-NIR light irradiation (Fig. 4b). It also indicates that the Pt co-catalyst deposition sequence and position could influence the H2 production activity, and those Pt nanoparticles located around PbS NCs in the Pt-(PbS/TiO2) nanocomposite would debases the hot electron transferring from PbS NCs to TiO2 NTs, and then causing the decreased activity of the PbS/TiO2 nanocomposite. Moreover, the 5.0 wt% PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite shows significantly enhanced activity (813 μmol h−1) compared to the summation (391 μmol h−1) of Pt–PbS (16 μmol h−1) and Pt–TiO2 (375 μmol h−1) activities under the same photoreaction condition (Fig. 4a). These results demonstrate that the photogenerated hot electrons of PbS NCs should be firstly transferred to TiO2 NTs, and then to Pt nanoparticles for H2 production (Fig. 7b) since this process can efficiently retard the fast photogenerated hot charge carrier recombination of PbS NCs in the nanocomposite. The above conjecture is supported by the transient photocurrents of the 5.0 wt% PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite irradiated by various UV monochromatic lights (λ = 350, 365, 380 and 400 nm). Although the Pt–TiO2 shows no variation in the photocurrent density with UV light wavelength changing from 420 nm (2.95 eV) to 350 nm (3.54 eV) (Fig. 8 a), the photocurrents of the 5.0 wt% PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite are enhanced along with the increase of irradiation photon energy from 2.95 eV (420 nm) to 3.40 eV (365 nm) (Fig. 8b). Especially, an abrupt increase of photocurrent is observed at a photon energy of 3.54 eV (350 nm), which is ~4.5 E g (0.78 eV) of PbS NCs. Furthermore, the AQY (38.6%) of the 5.0 wt% PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite at 350 nm is not only much higher than the AQY summation (23.76%) of Pt–PbS and Pt–TiO2, but also higher than those AQY values (≤8.35%) at monochromatic light wavelengths longer than 420 nm (Fig. 5a). These results are similar to the previous observation that PbS QDs (E g = 0.85 eV) need an excitation of photon energy with 1.77 eV (~2.1 E g) to initiate the multiple electrons generation (MEG) of PbS QDs, and then the hot electrons injection into the CB of TiO2 [17]. Shi and coworkers [26] have confirmed that the MEG process of PbS QDs in ZnO@PbS/GO can remarkably enhance the UV light-driven H2 production activity using transient absorption spectrum and photocurrents irradiated with femtosecond pulse laser. Most importantly, those PbS NCs also enable to robustly extend the H2 production activity of the TiO2 NTs to Vis-NIR region (Fig. 5a), which is much longer than that of PbS QDs-sensitized Cu/TiO2 system (for CO2 reduction [25]) and ZnO@PbS/GO (for H2 production [26]). For instance, the low energy photons at 700 and 760 nm still contribute relatively high AQY of 3.21% and 2.17%, and the threshold for efficient H2 production is ca. ~1.30 eV (~950 nm) according to the AQY curve of the 5.0 wt% PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite (Fig. 5a), which is ca. 0.52 eV higher than the bandgap (~0.78 eV) of PbS NCs. Therefore, it can be conjectured that the MEG property of those PbS NCs still remained after incorporation with Pt–TiO2, which results in the exciton multiplication and more hot electrons at those PbS excited states that are higher than the CB bottom (Fig. 7b), and then the efficient hot electron transferring from PbS NCs to Pt–TiO2 NTs for H2 production. The previous investigations have confirmed that the extraction of multiple excitons and hot electrons can be promoted by the strong electronic coupling between those closely contacted PbS QDs and TiO2 [17,22,23]. Our results mentioned above also demonstrate the strong electronic interaction between PbS NCs excited states and the TiO2's CB due to the closely interfacial contact (Fig. 3f), which enable the charge separation by above bandgap excitation of PbS NCs even though the band alignment with TiO2 is unfavorable for electron injection under band-edge excitation (Fig. 7b). Furthermore, the long fibrous ultrafine TiO2 nanotubes can provide good passage for electron transport and reduce the charge recombination in the PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite. This can be confirmed by the transient photocurrent curves under λ ≥ 420 nm light irradiation (Fig. S7a). Compared to the single PbS NPs, the PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposites exhibit obviously enhanced photocurrents, and the 5.0 wt% PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite has the best one. Similarly, the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) (Fig. S7b) show that the 5.0 wt% PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite exhibits smaller arc sizes in the middle-frequency region as compared to the PbS NPs. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 9 a) show an obvious quenching effect of the 5.0 wt% PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite compared to the PbS NPs, and the picosecond time-resolved photoluminescence spectra (TRPS) demonstrate that the fluorescence lifetime decrement of the PbS NCs after incorporating with Pt–TiO2 is 41% (from 3.87 to 1.45 ns) as shown in Fig. 9b and Table S1. These results suggest the faster and more effective hot electron transfer from PbS NCs to Pt–TiO2 through the closely contacted interface, which is accordance with the above H2 production activity."
9,Conclusion,"In summary, a clear demonstration that enables unusuall broadband (UV–Vis–NIR) light harvesting for efficient and steady H2 production system was attained on a novel PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite, which was fabricated by using infrared-bandgap PbS nanocrystals (NCs) sensitized ultrafine anatase TiO2 nanotubes (NTs). The resultant 5.0 wt% PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite achieves a H2 production activity of 813 μmol h−1 under UV–Vis–NIR irradiation, which is ~2.2 times as that (375 μmol h−1) of Pt-loaded TiO2 NTs (Pt–TiO2). Furthermore, those PbS NCs can extend the H2 production activity of Pt–TiO2 to Vis-NIR region (λ = 420–1064 nm) with an average H2 production activity of 186 μmol h−1, and achieves apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 38.6%, 26.2%, 2.43%, 3.21%, 2.17%, 0.36%, 0.11% and 0.01% illuminated at 350, 420, 550, 700, 760, 850, 950 and 1064 nm monochromatic light, respectively. The Vis-NIR-light responsive H2 production activity of the PbS/(Pt–TiO2) nanocomposite can be due to the intimate contacts at the interfaces of those PbS NCs and TiO2 NTs, which then promote the hot electrons of PbS NCs injecting into the CB of TiO2 NTs before the thermalization losses. The present results demonstrate an interesting possibility for fabricating efficient, steady and ultrabroadband-light-responsive H2 production system by coupling with infrared-bandgap materials to exploit the low-energy photons of the solar light."
