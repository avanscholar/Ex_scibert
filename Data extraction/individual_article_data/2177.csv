0,Introduction,"Microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) have been proposed as an alternative technology for production of hydrogen from waste and renewable materials. A MEC consists of an anode and a cathode, typically separated by a membrane, with a potential of 0.3 V or higher applied across the two electrodes (Fig. 1 ). Hydrogen is produced at the cathode, which is designed to enable its collection. The anode of a MEC is similar to the anode in microbial fuel cells (MFCs), while the cathode is different. Air or oxygen is supplied to the cathode in MFCs, where electrons are consumed, resulting in electricity production. In MECs, external energy in the form of applied potential is needed to drive the free energy of the reaction negative, thereby producing hydrogen at the cathode [1]. The process is bioelectrochemical in nature and involves use of microbes as the catalyst at the anode [2]. The cathodic reaction is also catalytic and uses either an inorganic catalyst such as platinum or a biological catalyst [3]. Industries such as food-processing plants, biobased chemical plants, oleochemical plants, and ethanol and biodiesel production plants produce large amounts of waste and wastewater rich in easily degradable organic matter. Like current processing facilities for biobased feedstocks, future biorefineries are expected to generate process streams containing large amounts of easily degradable organic wastes. Food processing plants produce a wide variety of process wastes whose diversity requires a case-by-case assessment for each plant. Deriving energy from these waste streams using MFCs/MECs has been investigated [4]. The waste streams from large-scale current and future biorefineries including ethanol production and more specialized facilities such as oleochemical plants converting natural fats and oils into various products such as polymers, biodiesel, etc, may also be amenable to MFC/MEC technology [5]. The oleochemical industry processes fats and oils from plant and animal sources via epoxidation, sulfonation, ethoxylation, hydrogenation, etc. and produces numerous chemical derivatives while generating oil-laden wastewaters. The biodiesel industry also produces wastes containing glycerol, residual fatty acids and alcohols which are suitable waste resources for energy extraction. Many of these waste streams are currently being processed using conventional technologies which require significant energy input to remove the organic matter. A rapidly growing segment the renewable industry is the biorefinery industry aimed at production of transportation fuels. Ethanol production in the United States and Brazil has grown in the last decade to exceed a combined 18 billion gallons, all using renewable feedstocks. Specifically, Brazil is projected to produce 7.3 billion gallons of ethanol this year from sucrose found in sugar cane, an extremely fast and simple yeast-based fermentation process [6]. Only about 45% of the cane sugar is used for ethanol due to the beneficial price of sugar. Effluent from cane sugar ethanol includes glycerol, yeast nutrients and cell debris and residual ethanol. More complex is the case for the United States which produced over 11 billion gallons of ethanol from almost exclusively corn-starch fermentation. The two main processes for ethanol production in the US are dry milling of corn, accounting for the vast majority of the 11 + billion gallons, and wet mill process accounting for only a few billion gallons plus about 2% imported ethanol largely from Brazil (www.rfa.org). The process streams from the dry and wet mill processes are different but are similar with regard to high carbohydrate concentration residues, glycerol and residual ethanol. The dry mill process produces a less refined stillage stream due to the simpler process. This stream contains more oil, protein and non-starch residues than the wet mill process, which yields purified starch as a source of fermentation glucose [7]. Either process produces effluent steams which can potentially benefit from the MEC technology. An upcoming process is ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass through the pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose. The pretreatment process is a thermochemical process that partially disrupts the cellulose-hemicellulose-lignin matrix found in plant matter. There are over a half dozen pretreatment processes, having both an alkaline, neutral or acid pH, which generate different pretreatment byproducts. However, each process liberates and creates a variety of inhibitors and other hydrolysis products that end up in the effluent or stillage from the ethanol recovery process. These chemicals vary but the common acidic process produces varying amounts of xylose and glucose acid degradation products furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural, respectively, as well as a variety of lignin breakdown products such as ferulic and coumeric acid derivatives. These materials are highly inhibitory and toxic to fermentation [8]. Ideally most of these chemicals are removed by extraction processes such as overliming or affinity extraction [9]. These chemicals end up in the waste stream along with stillage from the subsequent fermentation. The fermentation process produces ethanol and a variety of sugar byproducts as oligomer or non-fermentable monomer carbohydrates that eventually find their way to the aqueous stream resulting from ethanol extraction. Any process that removes these chemicals will be highly beneficial due to their inhibitory and recalcitrant nature in the case of the pretreatment byproducts or the sugar residues. The stillage stream or the stream resulting from distillation of the product/biofuel from the fermentation broth is a process stream which contains significant organic matter and requires processing in order to recycle the water and/or extract energy from the organics. One of the proposed schemes in biorefineries employing a biochemical conversion pathway is to concentrate the stillage stream using evaporators and use the resulting syrup in burners to generate steam [4]. The MEC process is a potentially feasible technology to derive hydrogen from the organic-rich streams for use as an energy carrier or a reagent in the biorefinery. An estimate of the amount of hydrogen that can be produced from the stillage streams in lignocellulosic biorefineries as well as existing biorefineries using sugar and starch-rich feedstocks is reported here. The outlook for potential improvement in energy recovery from the lignocellulosic biorefineries implementing MECs is presented. The estimates of hydrogen production from bioconversion of the specific compounds including complex carbohydrates, fermentation byproducts such as organic acids and pretreatment byproducts such as furfural, HMF and phenolic molecules are also included."
1,Theory/calculation,"Literature data on the volume of the biorefinery process water stream was compiled for various feedstocks/biorefineries. Characteristics of the streams including chemical oxygen demand and concentration of fermentation inhibitors, relevant for hydrogen production were also compiled from the literature. The data on chemical oxygen demand and flow rates was used to determine the amount of hydrogen production using the following equation [4]: (1) H M E C , i = C O D i M C O D ∗ Q i b i ∗ n H 2 n C O D ∗ M H 2 η H Where, H MEC,i , Hydrogen production in L per gallon of biofuel/bioproduct, i. COD, Chemical oxygen demand for wastewater stream i, g/L MCOD, Molecular weight of oxygen (COD) = 32 g/mol Qi, Wastewater flow rate per gallon of biofuel/bioproduct i, L/gallon bi biodegradability of organic carbon in wastewater type i nH2/nCOD, Ratio of number of moles of hydrogen obtained per mole of COD = 2. MH2, Molar volume of hydrogen, L/mol ηH, Efficiency of hydrogen production or hydrogen yield The anodic and cathodic half reactions for the degradation of carbohydrate, as an example of organic carbon present in wastewater, can be given as: (2) Anode: CH 2 O + H 2 O → CO 2 + 4 H + + 4 e − (3) Cathode: 4 H + + 4 e − → 2 H 2 The following assumptions were made based on the justification given below: Biodegradability of organic carbon in wastewater from industries processing carbohydrates and fats has been reported to be about 0.8 [10]. The biodegradability of the residual organic carbon remaining after fermentation may be lower due to presence of lignin and other components, which are slow to degrade. Comparison of the COD and biological oxygen demand (BOD) values for these streams (data shown in Table 1 ) indicates an average BOD/COD ratio of about 0.54. Therefore, a conservative estimate of b i = 0.5 was used in the calculations. Conversion of pretreatment byproducts to hydrogen was separately calculated to get an estimate based on individual substrates present in the process water. The biodegradability factor, b i for these molecules was assumed to be 100% (b i = 1.0), since literature reports indicate near complete degradation of these molecules [11]. The ratio of the number of moles of hydrogen produced per mole of BOD (= 2) is based on Equation (2). While this is a theoretical estimate, the experimental data reported by Cheng and Logan support this estimate [12]. They reported moles of hydrogen per mole of substrate ranging from 3.65 to 8.77, which is equivalent to an average of 1.6 mol of hydrogen/mole of BOD (total range for substrates considered: 1.35 to 1.83). A lower average value is expected due to the ohmic, mass transfer losses incurred during experimentation. These inefficiencies, are accounted for separately in the methodology presented via use of an efficiency factor and a biodegradability factor. The molar volume of hydrogen was assumed to be 22.4 L/mol based on standard temperature (25 °C) and pressure (1 atm) conditions. The efficiency factor for hydrogen production from the biodegradable organic carbon was assumed as 50%, to be on the conservative side. Realistically, higher hydrogen yields (up to 95%) have been obtained with soluble model substrates [1], however, this may not be the case for hydrogen production from complex carbohydrates that may be present in the biorefinery stillage streams."
2,Results,
3,Biorefinery process water characteristics,"3.1 Biorefinery process water characteristics The predominant biorefineries in the world are ethanol production facilities which have been growing at a rapid pace. The South American sucrose/sugar cane ethanol fermentation volume has about doubled the last eight years, while corn ethanol production in the United States has surged dramatically the last three years to surpass Brazilian production. In the US, almost all the increase in production has come from the dry corn mill process rather than the more complicated corn wet mill process [7]. Minor ethanol production comes from other sources such as beer ethanol recovery, and fermentation of food derived sugars to ethanol (www.rfa.org). Data regarding the wastewater from such facilities is difficult to obtain, but Wilke has provided an excellent overview of stillage content from biorefineries [13]. As seen in Table 1, ethanol production from sugar cane produces high levels of stillage to ethanol volume due to minimal concentration of the sucrose compared to cane molasses, but the BOD and COD levels are proportionately reduced. To capture the potential for corn dry mill stillage sources for comparison, an average plant was calculated from the operating 186 facilities in the US in Fall 2009 producing 11,900 million gallons yielding a facility size of 224 million liters of ethanol. Using data from Wilke, such a facility will produce approximately 17 times the volume of stillage than ethanol but much of the thin stillage is destined for backset/recycle, and water is lost by protein feed drying, explaining the well known ratio estimate of 4–6 times water volume to ethanol [14]. It has been estimated that US corn ethanol production will level out at about 15 billion gallons (RFS section 202, www.rfa.org), so in order to meet expected Renewable Fuel Standard levels of 36 billion gallons in 2022, ethanol production from biomass is viewed as a major alternative to conventional corn-starch ethanol. Biomass technology is fast approaching commercialization, and estimates of the first generation biomass processing plants are expected to be about 60 gallons of ethanol per ton of biomass. If the average cellulosic ethanol plant was 265,000 m3 (70 million gallons) per year, Wilke’s data can be used to estimate that over 2950 million liters of stillage would be produce per facility. Interestingly this is in line with the other very different processes with different carbohydrate sources. In addition, water use and deterioration of water output relative to input is important to sustainability of corn and biomass biorefineries. Corn ethanol plants contribute to total dissolved solids, increased sulfates, calcium and sodium [15] and similar solids can be expected from biomass conversion processes. Also, the BOD values in Table 1 clearly indicate that the organic matter found in the stillage is significant. Therefore, there is significant potential for conversion of organic matter found in biorefinery thin stillage to hydrogen with new technology."
4,Hydrogen production estimates,"3.2 Hydrogen production estimates 3.2.1 Carbohydrate conversion Conversion of a number of sugars to electricity has been shown using MFCs. These sugars include glucose [16], xylose [17], fructose, mannose, pentoses, uronic acids and gluconic acid [18]. Electricity production from starch [19,20] and cellulose [21,22] has also been demonstrated. This demonstrates that most of the carbohydrates present in the stillage can be converted to electricity by anodic microorganisms. A number of organic acids have also been used as substrates in MFCs [23]. Anodic reactions occurring in MECs are very similar to those occurring in MFCs, therefore, these substrates can produce hydrogen in MECs as demonstrated with glucose, organic acids [12] and cellulose [24]. Thermodynamic analysis for conversion of acetate, glucose and 2-furfural to hydrogen in MECs shows the free energy of reaction at 25 °C and pH 7.0 to be 104.6, 3.04 and 213.8 kJ/mol. This is equivalent to a theoretical potential of 0.14, 0.001 and 0.11 V for the 3 model substrates. The details of the calculations are given in the supplemental information. Application of an external voltage higher than these potentials can result in hydrogen production at cathode. Due to ohmic and other losses at the two electrodes, voltage higher than 0.3 V is typically needed to generate hydrogen under practical, biologically-relevant conditions [1,12]. Table 2 lists the hydrogen production potential from the stillage streams for various feedstocks in different biorefineries. The hydrogen production from the biorefinery stillage stream depends on a number of factors. These include the biotransformation efficiency and the presence of alternate electron acceptors as well as the design of the MEC system. The biotransformation efficiency for conversion of the organic carbon to electricity in MFCs is defined by coulombic efficiency (CE), which is representative of the electrons captured from the organic carbon as electrical energy. The CE obtained for carbohydrates is usually in the range of 5–40% [18,20,25]. These are relatively lower compared to non-fermentable substrates such as acetate. The reasons for lower CEs for the carbohydrates include loss of the electrons to fermentative and methanogenic biotransformations, oxygen leakage from the cathode to the anode and incomplete oxidation. The issues involved in conversion of carbohydrates present in biorefinery process streams and wastewaters to hydrogen are similar to those involved in conversion of organic matter to energy using MFCs or MECs in food industry wastewaters [4]. Breakdown of complex carbohydrates present in stillage and other streams in the anode of an MEC involves three steps. The first step is its depolymerization into monomeric constituents. The second step is fermentative degradation of the sugars into volatile fatty acids and hydrogen. The third step is the conversion of the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and hydrogen into protons and electrons (and carbon dioxide from the VFA’s). The hydrogen may diffuse to the cathode as a dissolved gas or be dissociated partially or fully, when ion-exchange membranes are used to separate the anode and cathode. Direct conversion of sugars to electricity is also possible [16]. However, when using microbial consortia, a recent study demonstrated that the primary route for electricity production from glucose was via VFA and hydrogen formation [26]. A study of microbial communities in the conversion of wheat-straw hydrolyzate to electricity in an MFC suggested presence of fermentative as well as potential exoelectrogens in the consortia [27], indicating partial support for the three-step conversion process. The overall carbohydrate conversion in MFCs has been reported to be quite high (approaching 90% or higher) [18,20,25,27,28] which indicates that degradation of the organic carbon by anodic consortia is not an issue. Assessment of twelve monosaccharides as substrates for energy production in MFCs showed more than 80% COD removal for all the substrates [18]. Use of starch as a substrate resulted in COD removal efficiency of up to 98%; however, with a CE of only 8% [20]. Conversion of polyalcohols derived from lignocellulosic carbohydrates showed a COD removal of 71–91% with a CE of 10–28% [25]. Conversion of wheat-straw hydrolyzate to electricity was reported to demonstrate CE of 15–37% [27]. Soluble COD (84% of total COD) in the hydrolyzate appeared to have been removed almost completely. Xylose utilization was shown in microbial anodes at a CE of 13–52%, which improved 24–93% using humic acids [28]. These molecules are typically present in lignocellulosic hydrolyzates and can also serve as mediators. Use of cellulose as a substrate for electricity production in MFCs has been demonstrated using co-cultures, artificial mixed cultures or enriched consortia [21]. While cellulose is expected to be nearly completely hydrolyzed into sugars at the exit of the fermenter or in the stillage stream in lignicellulosic biorefineries, presence of oligoscaccharides in the stream can be expected. A co-culture of Clostridium cellulolyticum and Geobacter sulfurreducens studied for its capability to convert cellulose was shown to be able to produce current with CEs in the range of 39–47% [22]. Hydrogen, acetate and ethanol were shown to be the main residual metabolites. Use of rumen microorganisms was also shown to produce electricity from cellulose, which were enriched in Comamonas species after two months of MFC operation [21]. Use of paper-industry wastewater containing cellulose as the substrate in anode resulted in 76% COD removal and a CE of 16% [29]. Almost complete removal of cellulose (96%) was demonstrated during the treatment. Use of cellulases has been shown to enhance utilization of cellulose by anodic microbes doubling the CE to 51% and increasing the COD removal from 14% to 73% [30]. Recently, a pure culture identified as Enterobacter cloacae has also been demonstrated to be capable of direct conversion of cellulose to electricity without the use of external mediators[31]. The diversion of the electrons towards nitrate reduction, sulfate reduction as well as methanogenesis can be an issue in the application of MECs in a biorefinery. The use of excess nitrate in fermentation media and the use of sulfuric acid as a pretreatment chemical has potential to reduce the energy recovery from MECs. Production of methane or hydrogen (in the anode chamber) was not observed in the study using the wheat-straw hydrolyzate as the substrate for electricity production [27]. In another study using cellulose as a substrate and rice paddy soil as inoculum, methanogens were found to be suppressed when a specific design was used. Ethanologens, on the other hand, were found to be enriched in the microbial community [32]. Absence of an aerobic cathode in MECs makes the oxidative pathway of electron loss, which is a concern in MFCs, irrelevant for hydrogen production using these devices. 3.2.2 Conversion of non-carbohydrate substrates Biorefinery process water also contains a number of other byproducts resulting from primarily two processes. The first is the pretreatment of cellulosic biomass and the second is fermentation of sugars [32]. Most pretreatment and fermentation processes produce certain byproducts from sugars which accumulate in the process stream if part or all of the water is recycled [32]. The byproducts from pretreatment include sugar-degradation products such as 2-furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural; lignin-degradation products such as aromatic aldehydes, ketones, alcohols and acids; hemicellulose deacetylation products such as acetate, etc. The fermentation byproducts include lactate, acetate and other volatile fatty acids. The concentration of these byproducts in the process stream depends on the biomass feedstock, type and severity of pretreatment and the recycle ratio, if the water is recycled [32]. The typical concentrations of the prominent byproducts resulting from pretreatment are reported in Table 3 . While the COD data reported in Table 1 is inclusive of these organic substrates, their conversion in MECs is specifically important due to their recalcitrant and inhibitory nature within the fermentation process. It is necessary to assess the ability of microorganisms present in MFC/MEC anode to transform these substrates. Utilization of acetate and organic acids as substrates in microbial anodes has been demonstrated in previous reports [23,33,34]. Conversion of furan-carboxaldehydes and certain phenolic molecules in MFC anodes has also been demonstrated recently [11]. Specifically, the conversion of 2-furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, hydroxyacetophenone and vanillic acid to electricity has been reported [11]. Experimental evidence has shown the anode potential to reach −0.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl electrode) in the MFC (unpublished data). Since the anodic biochemical reactions are similar in MFCs and MECs, the amount of hydrogen that can be derived from these byproducts (L/g byproduct) in MECs was estimated using Equation (1) and is shown in Table 3 (organic acids and furan-carboxaldehydes) and Table 4 (phenolic molecules). Table 3 indicates that acetate occurs at a relatively high concentration in hardwood hydrolyzates, while furfural and HMF were high in both hardwood and softwood hydrolyzates. The acid steam explosion method appears to release higher levels of the acetate, furfural and HMF as compared to the acid hydrolysis method. The phenolics, on the other hand, are observed to be high in hydrolyzates produced from acid hydrolysis treatment. In terms of the hydrogen production, the contribution of the phenolics is much lower than the acetate and the furan-carboxaldehydes."
5,Discussion,
6,Hydrogen production,"4.1 Hydrogen production In a typical biorefinery design using 2000 tons/day of lignocellulosic biomass as feedstock, the flow rate of the stillage stream was reported to be about 350 m3/hr [44]. The total ethanol production for the biorefinery process designed in the report developed by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) was 265,000 m3/year (70 million gallons/year). For such a biorefinery, using the pretreatment byproduct data for corn stover (Tables 3 and 4), the amount of hydrogen that can be potentially produced is about 1260 m3/hr. It should be noted that the data in Tables 3 and 4 was obtained for a 10% solids loading; however, typical biomass loading in a biorefinery is expected to be in the 25–30% range [44], which will result in higher amounts of hydrogen production from the pretreatment and other byproducts. Based on COD of stillage streams in a full-scale lignocellulosic biorefinery, the maximum hydrogen production rate can be 7200 m3/hr. From Tables 3 and 4, it is clear that the amount of byproducts present in the hydrolyzate and ultimately in the distillation bottoms, depends on a number of factors including the biomass/solids loading, type of biomass and the pretreatment process. The hardwoods generated the highest amount of these byproducts, while the herbaceous crops produced the least."
7,Energy and water balance in cellulosic biorefineries,"4.2 Energy and water balance in cellulosic biorefineries A typical process flow diagram for biomass to ethanol conversion in a cellulosic biorefinery is shown in Fig. 2 . This is based on the flowsheet for biochemical conversion of corn stover to ethanol developed by the NREL [44]. This process uses a combustor to burn all unconverted organics and a boiler to generate steam coupled to a turbogenerator to co-produce electricity. The unconverted sugars, fermentation byproducts and any inhibitory pretreatment products ending up in the stillage stream are concentrated in an evaporator to produce a syrup which is fed to the combustor with the separated solids (primarily lignin). This generates steam which is fed into the pretreatment process (high pressure, 9% of total energy pool) and distillation tower (low pressure, 10.7% of total energy pool). However, a significant portion of energy is lost from the evaporator and the boiler/combustor as water vapor, ambient heat, etc. Only about 53.5% of the total energy entering the process (primarily via biomass) is recovered as useful energy (48.7% in the form of fuel ethanol and 4.8% in the form of electricity). Thus, there is significant potential to reduce the energy loss by using a lower temperature energy recovery method (such as MECs). The amount of hydrogen production in a lignocellulosic biorefinery was estimated to be about 7200 m3/hr. This is equivalent to 91 GJ/h (based on an HHV value of hydrogen = 141.9 kJ/g)). Ethanol distillation requires about 160 GJ/h of energy which is typically provided by steam generated via combustion of lignin and residual organics [44]. The amount of hydrogen generated from residual organics, alone, is equivalent to 91 GJ/h (57% of the energy needed for ethanol distillation). It is unlikely that the hydrogen will be used as a fuel to generate heat, since significant amount of lignin is present, which can provide the required heat via production of steam. Further assessment of the energy recovery and conversion efficiencies with process schemes using MECs is reported elsewhere [45]. Future biorefineries are expected to generate many other higher value bioproducts which will require hydrogen as a chemical reagent. It may serve as a reductant in several other existing industries. For example, the need for hydrogen is expected to increase due to increased production of oil sands and heavy oils in the fossil energy industry. Secondly, use of stationary fuel cells for power production is expected to rise, which will also increase the need for hydrogen. Thus, production of hydrogen in biorefineries can have significant synergistic effects within the biorefinery as well as outside the biorefinery. The second component of the biorefinery process of importance is the potential to recycle water resulting from the implementation of MECs. The use of MECs has potential to minimize the use of make-up water, which constitutes 88.5% of the total water flow in the process (Fig. 2)."
8,Potential advantages of hydrogen production and the MEC technology,"4.3 Potential advantages of hydrogen production and the MEC technology The energy efficiency yields of the bioelectrolysis-based technology are much higher than any other type of process for production of hydrogen from biomass [45,46]. A maximum stoichiometric yield of 12 mol of hydrogen is possible from 1 mol of glucose. However, a theoretical maximum of only 4 mol of hydrogen can be realized via fermentative processes due to thermodynamic limitations (requirement of negative ΔG°). This represents an energy recovery efficiency of 33%, although practical efficiencies have been even lower [47]. Byproducts in the form of organic acids are formed which cannot be further fermented to hydrogen, thereby limiting hydrogen yields. The MEC technology overcomes this thermodynamic barrier by application of additional electrical energy. Much higher overall energy recovery efficiencies have been observed with the use of MECs. A maximum of 72% energy efficiency was reported for conversion of acetate to hydrogen [48]. This efficiency includes the energy supplied in the form of electrical energy, thus indicating that the MEC technology provides more than double the efficiencies observed with alternate hydrogen production technologies."
9,Current status of MEC technology,"4.4 Current status of MEC technology The MEC is a relatively new technology; however, rapid progress has been made since invention of MECs in early 2005 [1]. The hydrogen production rates in MECs have been reported to be in the range of 1–6m3/m3-d [1,49]. Recently, a significantly higher rate (50 m3/m3-d) was reported using Ni foam cathode, although increase in overpotential was reported to reduce the rate over time [50]. The rates in MECs are higher than those for photo-biological processes, but lower than those for dark fermentation [47,51]. A maximum rate of 189 m3/m3-d has been reported for dark fermentation using optimized bioreactors [52], although this technology suffers from low hydrogen yields [47]. Comparison of MECs with other hydrogen production technologies also reveals the hydrogen yields from MECs to be highly favorable [45]. In comparison to MFCs, the MEC technology is lagging behind. However, many advances being made in development of the MFC technology, particularly with respect to the anode electrode improvements may be applicable to MECs as well. The maximum current density reported for MEC is 188 A/m3 [53], whereas that for MFCs is in the range of 5600 A/m3 [54]. The current roadblocks to development of the MEC technology include: a. inefficient or expensive cathodes (both biological and chemical), b. need to minimize methanogenesis, c. ability to convert complex organics and particulate matter (e.g. biomass) to hydrogen, d. enabling design improvements separating anode and cathode without introduction of significant electrochemical resistance and to allow efficient collection of hydrogen from the cathode. Further work to improve the current densities and corresponding hydrogen production rates with a target of 100 m3/m3-d is needed to demonstrate the application feasibility of this technology [46]. Thus, significant more work is needed to enable commercialization; however, the benefits of this technology, namely the low carbon footprint (via use of renewable resources) and energy-efficient hydrogen production are important incentives to pursue the development of this technology."
10,Conclusions,"Potential of microbial electrolysis cells for production of hydrogen from residual organics including underutilized sugars and fermentation/pretreatment byproducts, in post-fuel production biorefinery streams was estimated. Future biofuel and bioproducts industries are expected to generate significant volumes of such waste streams (stillage or distillation bottoms stream). A full-scale starch-based biorefinery has potential to generate 750–8900 m3/hr of hydrogen, while a lignocellulosic corn stover-based biorefinery has potential to generate 1260–7200 m3/hr of hydrogen. The energy content of the hydrogen generated is estimated to be sufficient to meet 57% of the distillation energy demands in the lignocellulosic biorefinery. Removal of the organics from stillage including the inhibitory byproducts such as sugar- and lignin- degradation products has potential to facilitate water recycle as well. Recent developments in hydrogen production rates in MECs at a laboratory-scale and the volumes estimated in this study indicate significant potential for MECs to impact energy recovery in the form of hydrogen from existing and future biorefineries."
