0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a clean energy carrier, and it can be produced via different processes using fossil fuels and biomass-derived materials as hydrogen sources [1–4]. The use of biomass-derived materials in the H2 production is interesting and significant for effective materials recycling. Glycerol is one of biomass-derived materials, and it is produced in a large quantity as a byproduct in the transesterification reaction of vegetable oils into biodiesel fuels [5]. The photocatalytic H2 production from glycerol and water is less energy-consuming reaction because it can be processed under mild conditions, as compared for example with its steam reforming at high temperatures. It is reported that TiO2 based materials doped with several metal species are active catalysts for the photocatalytic H2 production from glycerol, including such dopants as Pt [6–9], Au [10,11], Pd [12], and CuO x [13–17]. Montini et al. prepared Cu nanoparticles embedded in TiO2 by a water-in-oil microemulsion method, and these Cu/TiO2 materials were active catalysts for the H2 production from glycerol and water under visible light irradiation conditions [13]. Li et al. studied the photocatalytic activity of Cu2O/TiO2 for the H2 evolution in the presence of different scavengers [16]. Recently, NiO x -doped TiO2 materials were reported to catalyze the photocatalytic degradation of undesired organic pollutants in water [18–20]. The doping of NiO x onto the surface of TiO2 is effective for the preparation of p-type (NiO x ) – n-type (TiO2) junction [21] and these NiO x -loaded TiO2 materials would be useable in photocatalytic reactions. The present authors recently showed that a NiO-supported TiO2 catalyst was active for the photocatalytic production of H2 from aqueous glycerol solution [22]. The NiO/TiO2 samples were prepared by a conventional impregnation method in which different calcination temperatures of 250–650°C were used to change the contact between the support (TiO2) and the dispersed phase (NiO). The calcination at 450°C was shown to produce the most active NiO x /TiO2 catalyst. The photocatalytic H2 production with NiO x /TiO2 should of course depend on other catalyst preparation and reaction conditions including parent TiO2 materials, NiO loading, glycerol concentration, and pH value. The effects of these factors and variables on the photocatalytic H2 production have been examined, optimized, and discussed in the present follow-up work. The roles of glycerol and water molecules have also been examined and the performance of NiO/TiO2 catalyst has been compared with that of other transition metal (Co, Cu) oxide doped TiO2 ones prepared in similar manners."
1,Experimental,"The experimental procedures of catalyst preparation, characterization, and activity measurement used are described in detail in a previous work [22]. In brief, four different TiO2 materials were used, which were TiO2(1) obtained from Catalysis Society of Japan (CSJ) (JRC-4), TiO2(2) purchased from Sigma–Aldrich, TiO2(3) prepared by a solvothermal method in the laboratory [23–25], and TiO2(4) from CSJ (JRC-6). Their structural and textural properties will be given later (Table 1 ). Nickel species was loaded onto these TiO2 materials by a conventional impregnation using Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Wako) as a precursor followed by calcination in air at an optimized temperature of 450°C. For comparison, CoO and CuO loaded TiO2 samples were also prepared using Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O (Wako) and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (Wako) as precursors, respectively. The NiO x /TiO2 samples prepared, which were different in the parent TiO2 and NiO loading, were characterized by X-ray diffraction (Rigaku RINT2200), field-emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM, JEOL JEM-2010F), N2 adsorption (Quantachrome NOVA 1000), and UV–vis spectroscopy (Shimadzu UV-3100). The photocatalytic activity of those NiO/TiO2 catalysts prepared was measured for the H2 production from a mixture of glycerol and water in a laboratory-made high-pressure batch reactor of 50cm3. The reactor was loaded with NiO/TiO2 sample, glycerol (Wako), and distilled water (Wako), purged by passing N2 (0.5MPa) three times, and closed and then the reactor was heated by a heating tape while stirring the reaction mixture with a magnetic stirrer. When the temperature reached to a reaction temperature of 50°C, the reaction mixture was illuminated using a 500W high-pressure Hg lamp (Ushio USH-500SC). The gaseous products evolved after the photocatalytic reaction were collected in a gas trap and analyzed with gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-8A) and mass spectrometry (MicrotracBEL BELCAT-A, BELMass)."
2,Results and discussion,"The NiO/TiO2 samples prepared were used to examine the influence of parent TiO2 materials, NiO loading, glycerol concentration, and initial pH on the photocatalytic H2 evolution from a mixture of glycerol and water (Scheme 1 ). In addition, the roles of glycerol and water have been discussed, and the performance of NiO/TiO2 samples has been compared with that of CoO/TiO2 and CuO/TiO2 ones prepared in similar procedures."
3,Screening of TiO2 materials,"3.1 Screening of TiO2 materials Four different TiO2 materials loaded with NiO in 2.0wt.% were prepared and tested for the photocatalytic H2 production from an aqueous glycerol solution. These samples were prepared via calcination at a temperature of 450°C, at which the photocatalytic performance was maximal as reported previously [22]. Table 1 shows structural and textural properties of parent and NiO-loaded TiO2 samples, and Fig. 1 gives their XRD patterns. Table 1 also present the results of photocatalytic H2 evolution for the NiO-loaded TiO2 samples. The parent TiO2 samples were observed to be even less active under the conditions used. The rate of H2 production was in the order of NiO/TiO2(1)>NiO/TiO2(3)>NiO/TiO2(2)>>NiO/TiO2(4) on the unit weight basis and NiO/TiO2(1)≈NiO/TiO2(2)>NiO/TiO2(3)>>NiO/TiO2(4) on the unit surface area basis. The former three samples of NiO on anatase and anatase-rich TiO2 materials were active for the H2 production (entries 2, 4, 6) but the latter one of NiO on rutile TiO2(4) was inactive (entry 8). In addition to H2, a few carbon-containing species, such as CO, CO2, and CH4, were observed to form and the total amount of these species did not depend so much on the catalysts used. For the most active catalyst, NiO/TiO2(1) (entry 2), the evolution of CO, CO2, and CH4 was 106, 41, and 19mmolg−1 h−1, respectively. In the case of less active NiO/TiO2(2) (entry 4), the total amount of the carbon-containing species (CO>>CO2 >CH4) was comparable to that of H2. From those results, TiO2(1) was then selected and used to further examine the influence of preparation and reaction conditions in the present work (TiO2(1) will be simply denoted as TiO2 hereinafter)."
4,Influence of NiO loading,"3.2 Influence of NiO loading Fig. 2 shows the rate of photocatalytic H2 production against the NiO loading. The H2 evolution rate was about 500μmolg−1 h−1 for TiO2 alone under the conditions used, and it was enhanced by the NiO loading, which was maximized at around 2wt.% NiO. The loading of NiO was not found to change the structure of TiO2 (Fig. 3 ) and its surface area. For 2wt.% NiO loaded TiO2, no appreciable NiO diffraction was detected, indicating that NiO was highly dispersed on the surface of TiO2. When the amount of NiO loaded was further increased, NiO diffraction was detected and NiO existed in the form of small crystallites. The high dispersion of NiO was also confirmed by FE-TEM for 2wt.% and 10wt.% NiO/TiO2 samples. It was observed that small NiO particles with diameter in a few nanometers were dispersed on the surface of TiO2 (TEM pictures are presented in Supporting information). UV–vis measurements were made to characterize those NiO/TiO2 samples. Fig. 4 gives UV–vis spectra collected, which were different depending on the NiO loading. These UV–vis results were used to estimate the band gap energy, E g, which was observed to merely decrease with an increase in the NiO loading (Fig. 5 ). In Fig. 6 , the H2 evolution rate is plotted against the E g value for NiO/TiO2 samples in which the NiO loading is 2wt.% or smaller and the calcination temperature is 450°C or 250°C. A good correlation exists between the H2 evolution rate and the E g value. The results of Fig. 2 may be explained by the change in the E g value for the NiO/TiO2 samples in which the NiO loading is ≤2.0wt.%. When the NiO loading is increased, the E g value further decreases (Fig. 5), but the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate does not increase (Fig. 2). This may be due to a decrease in the exposed area of TiO2 that can be illuminated by the light with an increase in the NiO loading. Recently, Li et al. reported the same conclusion on the influence of NiO loading in the photocatalytic water splitting over NiO/TiO2 composite nanofibers using methanol as sacrificial agent [29]. Li et al. used Cu2O/TiO2 catalysts for the photocatalytic water splitting using different scavengers [16]. They measured E g values for the catalysts different in the Cu2O loading and observed that the E g value decreased with an increase in the amount of Cu2O loaded, in accordance with the trend of Fig. 5. The relationship between the H2 evolution rate and the E g value was further examined by using other NiO/TiO2 samples different in NiO loading and calcination temperature, which should change the state of TiO2–NiO contact, and thus, change the E g value. The results (Fig. 6) show that the rate of H2 evolution tends to increase with a decrease in the E g value. Hence, the E g is a significant factor determining the activity of NiO/TiO2 for the photocatalytic H2 production from aqueous glycerol solution under the present reaction conditions. It is assumed that the loading of NiO (p-type semiconductor) to TiO2 (n-type conductor) produces a p–n junction through which an internal electric field appears at the interfacial layer between the NiO and TiO2 phases [30]. This should reduce the energy of optical excitation (E g) and retard the undesired recombination of electrons and holes produced by the optical excitation of the NiO/TiO2 catalyst."
5,"Influence of glycerol concentration, pH, and D2O","3.3 Influence of glycerol concentration, pH, and D2O Then, the influence of reaction conditions on the H2 production was examined. Fig. 7 shows the influence of initial glycerol concentration on the photocatalytic H2 evolution with the most active 2.0wt.% NiO/TiO2 catalyst. The rate of H2 evolution increases almost linearly with the glycerol concentration when it is small (<0.5moldm−3). When it is further increased, the H2 evolution rate also increases but not so largely and then levels off at around 1200μmolg−1 h−1 under the conditions used. The change of the H2 evolution rate with the glycerol concentration observed may indicate that the adsorption of glycerol on the catalyst obeys the Langmuir-type adsorption and the amount of glycerol adsorbed determines the rate of photocatalytic H2 production. Fig. 7 gives a dotted line calculated through the rate of H2 evolution = k 1 K a C 0 / ( 1 + K a C 0 ) , in which C 0 is glycerol concentration, k 1 is pseudo first order rate constant (1.3molg−1 h−1), and K a is equilibrium constant for glycerol adsorption/desorption (3.0dm3 mol−1). The observed experimental results of Fig. 7 can be correlated by the Langmuir adsorption model. Lalitha et al. studied the photocatalytic production of H2 from aqueous glycerol solution over Cu2O/TiO2 [15]. They observed that with increasing glycerol concentration, the rate of H2 evolution increased, similar to the result of Fig. 7, had a maximum, and then slightly decreased. It is noted that this behavior resulted from the saturation of active sites by glycerol [31]. Next, the influence of initial pH value was examined with the same catalyst. Fig. 8 shows that the rate of H2 evolution is maximal at a pH value of about 6.6, which is close to the pH at the zero-point charge of TiO2 [32,33], under the reaction conditions used. It is assumed that the quantity of surface hydroxyl groups, which can promote the adsorption of glycerol molecules through hydrogen bonding, is maximized at such a pH value, causing a maximum in the rate of H2 evolution. Those results (Figs. 7 and 8) indicate the significance of the adsorption of glycerol on the surface of NiO/TiO2 catalyst in determining the rate of photocatalytic H2 evolution. In contrast to the large change of the H2 evolution, the total amount of the carbon-containing species of CO, CO2, and CH4 evolved was not observed to change so much with the glycerol concentration and the pH condition. To examine the role of water, D2O was used instead of H2O for the photocatalytic H2 evolution with the most active NiO/TiO2 catalyst. The results obtained with D2O and H2O are compared in Fig. 9 . When D2O was used, the rate of hydrogen evolution was significantly deceased, which was about one-fourth of the rate with H2O, and the amounts of methane, CO, and CO2 evolved were increased. In particular, the amount of CH4 evolved was comparable to that of hydrogen evolved in the reaction in D2O. The gaseous hydrogen species after a photocatalytic reaction with D2O under the same conditions given for Fig. 9 except for a longer reaction time of 10h were analyzed by mass spectrometry. H2, HD, and D2 were detected to form but the relative amount of either HD or D2 was about 1.5% as compared to that of H2. Therefore, glycerol should be a main source for hydrogen, and water also could affect the hydrogen production as suggested by Fig. 9."
6,Hydrogen production from aqueous glycerol solution with NiO/TiO2,"3.4 Hydrogen production from aqueous glycerol solution with NiO/TiO2 As discussed above, the loading of NiO to TiO2 decreases the E g value, probably due to the formation of internal electric field at the interfacial layer between the NiO and TiO2 phases. In other words, the optical excitation can occur with a smaller energy by the presence of NiO. When the NiO/TiO2 catalyst is illuminated by light, pairs of electron and hole are produced and electrons formed would move to the NiO phase, which could retard the undesired recombination of electrons and holes [17]. Thus, the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 should be enhanced by the loading of NiO on its surface. Figs. 7 and 8 indicate the importance of the adsorption of glycerol; UV–vis measurements were made for a selected NiO/TiO2 sample before and after the adsorption of glycerol, which was confirmed by FTIR, but the E g value did not change by the presence of glycerol (the UV–vis and FTIR results are presented in Supporting information). Furthermore, the above-mentioned results with D2O indicate that glycerol may be a main hydrogen source. Although there is no experimental evidence for that hydrogen is also produced from glycerol in glycerol+H2O mixture, Figs. 7 and 8 show the significance of glycerol adsorption on the NiO/TiO2 catalyst, from which glycerol is assumed to be the hydrogen source. The authors attempted to analyze the liquid phase after the reaction for a longer time of 100h by GC and GC–MS but they failed to detect any organic compounds other than the substrate, glycerol. The gaseous carbon-containing species of CO, CO2, and CH4 were detected to form but in small quantities. The amounts of CO, CO2, and CH4 formed with the most active NiO/TiO2 catalyst under the conditions given in Table 1 were 106, 41, and 19mmolg−1 h−1; the total amount of these C-containing species was <1/10 of the amount of H2 formed. For pure water in the absence of glycerol, these species were not detected. Therefore, these C-containing species should originate from glycerol. The results of Fig. 9 with H2O and D2O indicate some effect of water molecules on the photocatalytic production of hydrogen in aqueous glycerol solution. However, no clear explanation can be found at present. In the literature, there are several works on photocatalytic water splitting using alcohols as sacrificial agents. Methanol and ethanol are known to act as sacrificial agents promoting the photocatalytic water splitting, in which these are oxidized by consumption of holes [16,34]. Li et al. studied the photocatalytic water splitting with Cu2O/TiO2 in the presence of different scavengers [16]. The effectiveness for the H2 production was in the order of methanol>glycol≈glycerol>anhydrous ethanol but not so significant. They note that the scavengers react only with the hydroxyl radical but not with its precursor hole because water is easier to be adsorbed on the catalyst of Cu2O/TiO2 compared to the scavenger molecules [16]. It is speculated in our case that the adsorption of water molecules on the NiO/TiO2 catalyst influences the adsorption of glycerol molecules and/or water molecules are involved in the photocatalytic production of hydrogen from glycerol. These indirect and/or direct effects of water might be responsible for the isotope effects observed (Fig. 9). Lalitha et al. propose reaction mechanisms for the photocatalytic H2 production from aqueous glycerol solution over Cu2O/TiO2 catalyst [15]; glycerol is attacked by hydroxyl radical formed from water and hole and, through several hydration and dehydration steps forming smaller intermediates, changes to H2 and CO2. According to these mechanisms, H2 would result from glycerol and water. Petala et al. observed the formation of such intermediates as acetone, acetaldehyde, and formic acid in addition to H2 and CO2 in the photocatalytic reforming of glycerol with Cu x O/TiO2 catalysts [17]. In our case using NiO/TiO2 catalysts, the stoichiometric reaction of Scheme 1 does not occur and the results with D2O suggest that hydrogen mainly comes from glycerol rather than water. To elucidate reaction mechanisms, further works are needed, for example, those using labelled glycerol."
7,Comparison with other metal-loaded TiO2 catalysts,"3.5 Comparison with other metal-loaded TiO2 catalysts Finally, the performance of NiO loaded TiO2 catalyst was compared with that of other transition metal (Co, Cu) loaded TiO2 ones, which were prepared in similar preparation procedures using TiO2(1) (Table 1) and Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O as precursors, respectively. For these samples, the metal loading was 2.0wt.%, and the calcination temperature was 450°C, which were optimized for NiO/TiO2 catalyst in the previous work [22]. The results obtained with the three metal loaded TiO2 catalysts so prepared are compared in Fig. 10 . When compared with NiO/TiO2, the rate of H2 evolution with CuO/TiO2 was comparable but that with CoO/TiO2 was even smaller. The formation of such carbon containing products as CO, CO2, and CH4 were observed for the three catalysts and a larger amount of CH4 was formed with CuO/TiO2 as compared to NiO/TiO2 and CoO/TiO2. For the CuO-loaded TiO2 catalyst, undesired reactions might have occurred under the conditions used. Gui et al. studied the photocatalytic steam reforming of CO2 over CuO, NiO, and CoO loaded TiO2 catalysts [35]. They found that the rate of CH4 formation with CuO/TiO2 was larger compared to the other catalysts; that is, it has a larger activity for the methanation of CO2. Thus, NiO is a good choice for preparing active TiO2 based materials for the photocatalytic H2 production from aqueous glycerol solution."
8,Conclusions,"The loading of NiO onto the surface of TiO2 reduces the band gap energy (E g) of NiO/TiO2 catalyst, and the E g value decreases with increasing NiO loading. This enhances the photocatalytic activity of NiO/TiO2 for the H2 production from a mixture of water and glycerol. At a larger NiO loading, however, the rate of H2 production becomes lowered probably due to a decrease in the exposed surface area of TiO2 that can be illuminated by light. With increasing glycerol concentration the H2 evolution increases linearly, slightly, and then levels off, which can be correlated by Langmuir-adsorption model. The rate of H2 evolution depend on the pH of the mixture and is maximized at a certain pH close to the zero-point charge. These results indicate the significance of the adsorption of glycerol in the photocatalytic H2 production over NiO/TiO2. The results with D2O shows an isotope effect on the evolution of hydrogen, and H2 was main hydrogen species produced with a smaller amount (1.5%) of either HD or D2. It is likely that glycerol is a main hydrogen source and water also could affect the hydrogen production. NiO is a good choice in preparing active TiO2 based catalysts as compared with the other transition metal oxides of CoO and CuO loaded to TiO2 in the same manners."
