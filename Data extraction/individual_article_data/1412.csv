0,Introduction,"The by-products of forest and annual-crop agriculture provide a viable substitute to replacing materials derived from petroleum-based product (Li et al., 2021; Palai et al., 2019). Renewable and biodegradable biomass-derived materials are low-cost and plentiful, which makes them applicable in areas such as packaging films and biomedical products. Sugarcane, grown in tropical countries and regions such as Brazil, India, and the southernmost China, is a common agricultural crop for the sugar industry, with the bagasse being discarded as waste (Kundu et al., 2020). Aside from restricted use as a fuel for domestic cooking or heating in rural areas, the bulk of agricultural residues are directly burned directly in the fields, which is possibly reasonably a contributing factor in China's extreme haze episode (Huang et al., 2014). Bagasse has been extensively studied for the development of biomaterials due to its appealing hemicellulose content (Solier et al., 2020). Among the hemicelluloses, xylan is one of the most common types. It is the most abundant polysaccharide except for cellulose (Ebringerová et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2011). Recently, xylan-based films have attracted ever-increasing attention because the raw materials are inexpensive and readily available in nature (Hu et al., 2019; Laine et al., 2013; Saxena et al., 2011; Solier et al., 2020; Sousa et al., 2016; Yousefi et al., 2020). However, xylan films have not been successfully used in material applications due to their hydrophilicity (Mikkonen and Tenkanen, 2012), which in turn leads to poor water vapor resistance performance. Water vapor permeability (WVP) is a critical property in many film packaging applications that affects the shelf life and stability of products (Tock, 1983). Recently, silane coupling agent (SCA)-doped polymers have been widely explored in this field. Abdelmouleh et al. reported that the surfaces of cellulose fibers became hydrophobic after silane treatment (Abdelmouleh et al., 2004). In the study of Zhang and others (Zhang et al., 2016), γ-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (KH550)-modified cellulose nanocrystals were incorporated into soy protein isolate-based films. The results showed that the water absorption of the films decreased, while the water contact angle (WCA) increased after SCA modification. The incorporation of SCA into polymers significantly enhances the water vapor resistance of the materials. This inspires us to fabricate moisture-barrier films based on polysaccharide polymers. However, SCA may form aggregates in the material, leading to defects in the films. Therefore, a synergistic approach to reduce the effect of agglomeration is urgently needed. Citric acid (CA), a bio-based polycarboxylic acid found in fruits, is a nontoxic cross-linker (Gyawali et al., 2010). In the previous research, CA has been widely used as a crosslinking agent to improve the properties of starch (Garcia et al., 2014; Menzel et al., 2013; Reddy and Yang, 2010). Researchers have extensively focused on the use of CA as a cross-linker for polysaccharide-based films to improve their water resistance and physical performance (Ghanbarzadeh et al., 2011; Pereira et al., 2017; Priyadarshi et al., 2018; Reddy and Yang, 2010). For instance, Yang et al. reported a CA-cross-linked xylan/hydroxyethyl cellulose film doped with PEG-400 as the plasticizer. As a result, the CA decreased the WVP of the composite films because of the tortuous path effect (Yang et al., 2019). In another study (Wang et al., 2014b), CA was used as a new plasticizer (or cross-linking agent) in the production of composite films containing xylan and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). When the PVA/xylan was set as 3:1 (w/w), a higher CA content resulted in a lower WVP value. This implied that the crosslinking extent in the films could positively affect their water-resistance properties. So far, many studies have demonstrated that SCA or CA could improve the water vapor barrier of films. However, these methods seem to improve WVP in a limited manner. Hence, this leads to the hypothesis that these two methods should have some synergistic effects in terms of further enhancing the water vapor barrier efficiency of xylan-based films. To realize this aim, xylan was first modified by (3-mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane (MPTMS) to obtain MPTMS-modified xylan (MSMX), and then the CA was used as a cross-linking agent in this work. We infer that the synergistic effect will greatly increase the density of the film to hinder the water vapor transmission. It is expected to prolong the diffusion path of vapor and thus largely improve the impermeability of the films. In addition, the effects on mechanical properties and water-resistance performance were systematically investigated."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Sugarcane bagasse xylan was purchased from Yuanye Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China), the Mw was 3 × 104 g/mol. (3-Mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane (MPTMS) was supplied by Macklin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). PVA-1799 was provided by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., LTD. (Shanghai, China). The sodium hydroxide (NaOH), hydrochloric acid(HCl), DMSO and citric acid (CA) were purchased from Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.(Tianjin, China). All chemicals were reagent grade and used as received without further purification."
3,MSMX preparation,"2.2 MSMX preparation (3-Mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane-modified xylan (MSMX) was prepared according to a previously reported method with a slight modification (Marco et al., 2018). Xylan (0.396 g) was dissolved in 20 mL of HCl aqueous solution (C = 1%). Subsequently, MPTMS (0.588 g) was added, and the mixture was stirred at 30 °C for 30 min under a nitrogen atmosphere. Then, 20 mL of NaOH aqueous solution (C = 2%) was added and stirred for 2 h. After the reaction, the mixture was adjusted to pH7.0 and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The residue was washed (50 mL water, 50 mL acetone, 2 × 50 mL water) and then centrifuged (5 min at 4000 rpm) after each washing step. The obtained MSMX was finally lyophilized and kept in a desiccator at 23 °C."
4,Film fabrication,"2.3 Film fabrication The schematic approach for the fabrication of films is shown in Scheme 1 . Specifically. PVA was dispersed in 10 mL of DMSO and dissolved at 95 °C for 1 h to obtain PVA solution. Subsequently, xylan or MSMX was added to the PVA solution and incubated at 75 °C for 2 h (the ratio between the PVA and xylan, PVA and MSMX was 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 4:1, w/w in both). Finally, 0.2 g CA (20 % based on the total weight of PVA and MSMX solids) was added to the mixture at 75 °C and kept for 1 h. The film samples were named according to the mixing conditions (e.g. PM-2 (PVA: MSMX = 2 : 1, w/w), PX-2 (PVA: xylan = 2 : 1, w/w), PM-2/CA (PVA: MSMX = 2 : 1, w/w, plus 0.2 g CA)).The sample names with detailed information are shown in Table A.1. Then, the well-mixed solutions were poured into an automatic coating machine (ZAA 2300, Zehntner, Switzerland) to scrape the films on the acrylic sheet separately, followed by heating at 75 °C for 2 h. Finally, the films were stored at a temperature of 23 °C and relative humidity of 50 % for further tests."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization 2.4.1 Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was conducted on a Spectrum 10 spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Inc., USA) with 32 scans in a range of 400 to 4000 cm−1 at a resolution of 4 cm−1. 2.4.2 NMR spectra 1 H-NMR spectra of xylan and MSMX were obtained on ADVANCE III 400 MHz spectrometer (Bruker Inc., Germany) using 0.5 mL DMSO-d6 as solvent for 20 mg samples. 2.4.3 Field emission scanning electron microscopy The microtopography of the samples and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were observed on an electron microscope (JSM-7800 F, JEOL, Ltd., Japan). Prior to the observation, the samples were sputter coated with gold. 2.4.4 X-ray diffraction test (XRD) The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded in reflection mode in the angular range of 10° to 50° (2θ) in steps of 0.02° (2θ), and the measurements were conducted on an X-ray diffractometer (XRD-7000S, Shimadzu, Corp., Japan). 2.4.5 Mechanical properties The tensile strength (TS) and elongation at break (E) of the films were evaluated according to ASTM D882-12 (International, 2012) and measured by an electronic tensile machine (XLW (PC), Labthink, China). The samples were cut into strips (70 mm × 10 mm), and then the measurements were conducted at a testing speed of 50 mm/min. 2.4.6 Water contact angle The hydrophilicity of the films was evaluated and measured on a goniometer (SL200KB, Kino, USA). A water droplet of 10 u L was carefully injected onto the surface, and then an image of the droplet was captured. 2.4.7 Water vapor permeability The water vapor transmission rate (WVT) of the samples was measured on a permeability analyzer (TSY-T1, Labthink, China) at 38 °C and a relative humidity of 90 %. The WVP was calculated by Eq. (1) as follows: (1) W V P = 1.157 × 10 − 9 × W V T • d Δ p where WVP is the water vapor permeability (g/cm−1·s ·Pa), WVT is the water vapor transmission (g/m2·24 h), d is the film thickness (cm), and Δp (Pa) is the difference in partial water vapor pressure between the two sides of each film sample."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Structure characterization of MSMX,"3.1 Structure characterization of MSMX The MSMX was prepared by silane modification to graft MPTMS onto xylan under alkaline conditions. When the HCl solution was presented, the MPTMS was hydrolyzed to form water-miscible silanol groups. Then, NaOH solution was added. The NaOH acted as a catalyst, leading to the formation of SiOxylan bonds. Meanwhile, the mercapto groups (SH) were introduced when the solution was alkaline (Marco et al., 2018). The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the pristine xylan and MSMX are shown in Fig. 1 a. As shown in the FT-IR spectrum of the native xylan, the peak at around 896 cm−1 was ascribed to β-glucosidic linkages between the sugar units (Kac̆Uráková et al., 2000). The peak of symmetric CH vibration appeared at around 2900 cm−1, and a strong peak of hydroxyl stretching vibrations appeared at 3435 cm−1 (Zhang et al., 2018). Comparatively, the original structure of xylan was not destroyed by this chemical modification. The spectrum of the MSMX retained the same characteristic absorption peaks as those of the native xylan. In addition, the FT-IR spectrum of the MSMX presented a new peak at 798 cm−1, which could be attributed to Si-O and Si-C stretching bands (Marco et al., 2018). Besides, the peak of mercaptan group appeared at 2550 cm−1 in MSMX chain (Chatterjee et al., 2020). To better characterize MPTMS-doped xylan, we applied nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to analyze the chemical structure of MSMX. As shown in 1H-NMR spectrum of xylan (Fig. 1b), the major chemical shifts at 3.04, 3.24, 3.49, 3.88, and 4.27 ppm were attributed to the protons H-2, H-5, H-3, H-4, and H-1 of D-xylose units, respectively (Fundador et al., 2012). The peaks at 4.99 (2-OH) and 5.12 (3-OH) ppm are assigned to the hydroxyl groups of anhydroxylose units (AXU) (X. Q. Zhang et al., 2018). Comparatively, the 1H-NMR of MSMX showed the new signals at 3.51, 3.59, and 3.85 ppm corresponding to the protons of MPTMS, respectively. In addition, the peak strength of hydroxyl proton was weakened, which was attributed to the grafting of the hydroxyl of xylan by MPTMS. In general, these results indicated the successful grafting between MPTMS and xylan. Fig. 2 a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of unmodified xylan and MSMX. The unmodified xylan presented a broad diffraction peak at approximately 2θ = 19.5°, indicating an amorphous structure. Additionally, some peaks for small crystalline regions were observed. It could be explained that the unsubstituted regions of the xylan backbone could more easily approach each other, and formed stable interchain associations (Peng et al., 2011). In this work, we demonstrate that MPTMS can significantly hinder the crystallization of xylan. Similarly, Zhong et al. have proven that long-chain succinic anhydride grafting modification can reduce crystallization extent (Zhong et al., 2013). And this phenomenon could be explained that the MPTMS grafting prevented xylan chains from aggregating, as it likely disrupted the intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, the morphology changes were also studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. 2 b-c). For the unmodified xylan, a spherical structure with a smooth surface was observed. In contrast, the MSMX was covered by mercapto groups of siloxane functionalization and formed an “island” (Hettegger et al., 2015). Furthermore, the diameter of the MSMX was larger than that of the native xylan, indicating a high polymerization efficiency of the MPTMS on the xylan surface. More importantly, the MSMX contained a large amount of sulfur and silicon as shown in Fig. 2 d. Consequently, all the results listed above (i.e., FT-IR, SEM, and XRD) have proven that MPTMS was successfully grafted on xylan."
8,FT-IR characterization of the films,"3.2 FT-IR characterization of the films FT-IR was applied to investigate the signal changes at specific peaks, which could be regarded as a result of interactions in the matrix. As shown in Fig. 3 , the broad peak of PX-2 at 3338 cm−1 represented OH stretching. In contrast, the OH stretching vibration absorption band of PM-2 was redshifted to 3304 cm−1. This spectral behavior indicated that the interaction between MSMX and PVA was stronger than that in PX-2 films. When CA was added to the matrix of PVA/MSMX, the peak at around 1718 cm−1 became sharp and widen. The peak sharping and widening was caused by CO stretching which suggested the presence of carboxyl group mainly from CA (Azeredo et al., 2015). This phenomenon also suggested that CA was fully integrated into the film matrix. It's worth noting that the OH stretching region of PM-2/CA blueshifted to 3338 cm−1. This demonstrated the effects of CA on the PM-2 film, which changed the molecular conformation of PVA and MSMX. Hence, it could enable them (PVA and MSMX) to expose more reactive groups, such as hydroxyl or thiol groups. Most studies have been focused on the interaction between matrix and multifunctional additives, such as plasticizers and crosslinkers. The addition of additives (citric acid, sorbitol, and glycerol) can lead to transformation of molecular three-dimensional(3D) organization in the film matrix (Liu et al., 2013; Myllärinen et al., 2002). Wu et al. reported a starch/polyvinyl alcohol/citric acid ternary blend film, and found that the addition of citric acid result in stronger interactions between PVA and starch (Wu et al., 2017). Das and co-workers also confirmed the possibility of CA providing the available OH group as plasticizer (Das et al., 2019). In this case, CA, as a small molecule cross-linker, formed strong hydrogen bonds and cross-linked the hydroxyl of PVA and the sulfhydryl or hydroxyl group of MSMX to each other. The possible mechanism of PVA/MSMX/CA films is shown in Scheme 2 ."
9,Morphological analysis,"3.3 Morphological analysis To understand the cross-linking of CA in the PVA/MSMX films, the surface morphology of the film samples was investigated. The SEM micrographs of PX-2, PM-2, and PM-2/CA are shown in Fig. 4 . The micrograph of PX-2 showed a smooth surface. When MSMX was introduced to PVA, the surface of the film became relatively rough and presented many “sea-island” structures, due to the agglomeration of MSMX. In contrast, the PVA/MSMX film with CA showed the reduced “sea-island” structures on the film, and some small nodules appeared on the surface. This could be possibly attributed to the cross-linking reaction between PVA and MSMX by CA. These results confirmed that the agglomeration effect of MSMX was weakened by CA. The SEM observation agreed with the FT-IR results, showing that PVA and MSMX were connected by crosslinking via hydrogen bonding and formed a dense network structure with the presence of CA."
10,Mechanical properties,"3.4 Mechanical properties As shown in Fig. 5 , the influences of the weight ratio of PVA and MSMX, as well as the effect of CA cross-linking in the PVA/MSMX films on the tensile strength (TS) and elongation at break (EB) were investigated. Compared with the unmodified xylan films, the PVA/MSMX films showed significantly improved TS values. The result confirmed that MSMX could be used to prepare xylan films with excellent mechanical strength. Interestingly, the TS and EB values obtained in the present work are different from the reported values of xylan-based films, which is widely believed. It has been shown in previous studies that xylan films easily became brittle without the addition of an external plasticizer (Escalante et al., 2012; Zhong et al., 2013). With respect to blend films without external plasticizers, the mechanical strength mainly depends on the number of hydrogen bonds. In this study, it was obvious that PVA/MSMX films exhibited a higher TS than that of the PVA/xylan films. This was because the MPTMS weakened the hydrogen bonds between the xylan molecular chains, which was confirmed by the XRD results. As CA was introduced into the PVA/MSMX films, the TS decreased slightly while the EB significantly improved. When the PVA/MSMX weight ratio was 2:1, the EB of PVA/MSMX/CA films increased up to 480 %, which could be attributed to the CA simultaneously acting as a cross-linking agent and plasticizer in the films. The dissociative (not hydrogen bonding cross-linked) portion of the CA likely played a role of a “lubricating oil,” which led to the mobility of the molecular chain during film formation. This result was consistent with the findings of Wu et al. (Wu et al., 2019)."
11,Water contact angles and water vapor barrier properties of MSMX-based films,"3.5 Water contact angles and water vapor barrier properties of MSMX-based films The surface wettability of the films was evaluated by the static contact angle method, as shown in Fig. 6 a. With an increasing ratio of PVA/MSMX, the WCA of the PVA/MSMX and PVA/MSMX/CA films first showed an increasing trend, then decreased. The MSMX accounted for a larger proportion of the total mass when the weight ratio of the PVA/MSMX was 1:1. This led to macroscopic phase separation, and the surface pores of the films were formed, thereby affecting the WCA of the films (de Carvalho et al., 2019). When the PVA content increased, the WCA decreased from 77.5° (for PM-2 film) to 53.1° (for PM-4 film). This is probably because the hydroxyl groups in the molecular chain of PVA are sensitive to water molecules (Kokabi et al., 2007). Compared with that of the PVA/MSMX films, the hydrophobicity of the PVA/MSMX/CA films significantly improved because of the cross-linking between the PVA and MSMX by CA, reducing hydroxyl groups from the PVA chains. The result showed that the PVA/MSMX/CA films prepared in this study exhibited a good solvent resistance. The WVP values of the PVA/MSMX and PVA/MSMX/CA films are shown in Fig. 6 b. The improved barrier properties were probably because of the “torturous path effect” (Liu et al., 2016a,b; Sangermano et al., 2017). We hypothesized that several factors were playing crucial roles in reducing the WVP of PVA/MSMX and PVA/MSMX/CA films. First, the tortuous permeation path of water vapor passing through the films was caused by the silane coupling agent (MPTMS). Second, the agglomeration effect of the MSMX was weakened by the CA, which led to the even dispersal of MSMX in the PVA matrix. The multiple hydrogen bond networks of CA also contributed to this change, which increased the density of the films. Meanwhile, a reduced free volume in the film matrix made it difficult to accommodate the permeation of water molecules through the films. Thus, the water molecules had to follow the more tortuous permeation path (Akin andTihminlioglu, 2018; Liu et al., 2019b). To better understand the torturous path effect, a mechanism schematic is shown in Scheme 3 . To better display the water vapor barrier ability of the prepared film, the WVP values of a series of polysaccharide-based films are summarized in Table 1 . By comparison, it turns out that the PVA/MSMX/CA film in our work possessed the lowest WVP value, proving its excellent water vapor barrier property."
12,Conclusion,"To improve water vapor barrier performance and flexibility of xylan-based films, the first attempt to commix MPTMS and CA was carried out in this study. Specifically, xylan from sugarcane bagasse was firstly modified with MPTMS, and then blended by PVA with CA as a cross-linker. As a result, when CA was added, the films (PM-2/CA) exhibited excellent water vapor barrier property with a low WVP value of 2.79 × 10−13 (g/cm-1·s Pa and a promising mechanical property with a high EB value of 480 %. In contrast to previously reported vapor barrier materials, the silane “fortress” barrier as well as the cross-linked network caused by CA induced via hydrogen bonding induced a long diffusion length and strong resistance, thus suppressing the moisture permeability. More importantly, the synergistic effect of MPTMS and CA investigated in our study not only showed great potential for the development of films with excellent water vapor barriers, but also increased the overall value of xylan."
