0,Introduction,"Zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) is a polymorphic material with three thermodynamically stable crystal structures: monoclinic, tetragonal, and cubic [1]. Monoclinic ZrO2 (i.e., baddeleyite) is a room-temperature (RT) form typically covered with hydroxyl groups. Tetragonal and cubic ZrO2 are stable at temperatures exceeding 1473 and 2673 °C, respectively. In addition to its structural diversity, ZrO2 has unique physicochemical properties, such as acidity, basicity, (hydro)thermal stability, ionic conductivity, chemical inertness, and metal support interactions, offering potential as a catalyst and catalyst support [2,3]. The potential of ZrO2 for catalytic applications has been demonstrated in various catalytic reactions, such as methanol synthesis [4–6], oxidation [7], hydrogenation and dehydrogenation [8,9], and dry reforming of methane [10,11]. However, unlike other oxide materials (e.g., SiO2, Al2O3, and TiO2), the practical applications of pure ZrO2 for commercial use are limited because of its relatively low acidity, basicity, and porosity (SBET < 50 m2 g−1). The physicochemical properties of ZrO2 can be improved by introducing heteroatoms or functional groups to the structure. Sulfated zirconia (SO x /ZrO2) is a representative solid superacid that can be prepared by the simple impregnation of sulfate ions into ZrO2 [12]. SO x /ZrO2 exhibits outstanding performance in a variety of acid-catalyzed reactions [13,14]. Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) can be obtained by adding ~2%–3% Y2O3 to the ZrO2 lattice and the cubic YSZ structure is stable even at RT [15,16]. Thus, YSZ can be used in refractories, thermal barrier coatings, electroceramics, and solid oxide fuel cells [17,18]. Ramírez et al. reported the synthesis of an Al2O3–ZrO2 mixed oxide with variable amounts of ZrO2, and showed improved textural and acidic properties [19]. In addition, ZrO2–CeO2 systems are known to have excellent thermal stability and oxygen storage capacity, and are thus used as major components in three-way catalysts for the treatment of automotive exhaust gases [20]. Apart from the addition of heteroatoms, numerous trials have been conducted to synthesize high-surface-area ZrO2 by controlling the synthetic variables and post-treatment of hydrous ZrO2. Chuah and Jaenicke reported the influence of the precipitating agent and digestion conditions on the textural properties of ZrO2 [21,22]. NaOH digestion at 100 °C for 12–24 h was reported to be optimal for the synthesis of ZrO2 with a surface area as high as 250 m2 g−1. They also synthesized ZrO2 with the surface area of 550 m2 g−1 by digesting hydrous ZrO2 prepared from the hydrolysis of zirconium propoxide [23]. The resulting material exhibited remarkable thermal stability, retaining a surface area exceeding 100 m2 g−1 even after calcination at 900 °C. Jung and Bell also obtained high-surface-area ZrO2 (SBET > 400 m2 g−1) by digesting zirconyl chloride in a boiling NH4OH solution [24,25]. Aguila et al. obtained tetragonal ZrO2 with surface areas of 90–200 m2 g−1 by post-synthesis treatment with NaOH and NH4OH solutions [26]. However, most of the studies on the synthesis of high-surface-area ZrO2 at high pH have not considered the dissolution of SiO2 from laboratory glassware, and accordingly, the addition of Si during the synthesis has not been characterized. Elsewhere, the dissolution of Si from SiO2 and quartz glassware has been reported, and the dissolution rate was accelerated at high pH and high-temperature conditions [27]. In the present study, the effect of Si incorporation on the physicochemical and catalytic properties of Si-added ZrO2 (SZ) was systematically investigated. The phase transformation of ZrO2 by Si incorporation was monitored by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the increase in the surface area was measured by N2 sorption. The Si content was quantitatively measured by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The increase in acidity was characterized by infrared (IR) spectroscopy with pyridine adsorption and the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of isopropyl alcohol (IPA). In addition, the stabilization of the ZrO2 phase by Si incorporation was theoretically calculated using density functional theory (DFT). The catalytic properties of SZ for the dehydration/dehydrogenation of IPA were also investigated."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation SZ mixed-metal oxides were synthesized by a hydrothermal method at Si/(Si + Zr) molar ratios of 0–0.4. In a typical synthesis, a 0.5 M aqueous solution of ZrO(NO3)2·2H2O (KANTO, 99%) was prepared and mixed with 10.0 vol% Si(OC2H5)4 (Acros Organics, 98%) ethanol solution. A solution of NH4OH (SK Chemical, 28 wt%) was added dropwise to the precursor solution until the pH of the resulting solution leveled off at 10.0. The final solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and aged at 100 °C for 24 h at 60 rpm. After the hydrothermal synthesis, the product was recovered by centrifugation and dried at 60 °C. Finally, SZ mixed oxides were obtained by calcination under ambient air for 6 h at 700–900 °C. The SZ mixed oxides prepared by the hydrothermal method are denoted as SZ-x, where x denotes the Si/(Si + Zr) molar ratio in % (i.e., x = 0–40.0). The SZ-x catalysts indicate the samples calcined at 700 °C, unless otherwise stated. To compare the effect of Si incorporation during a conventional synthesis at high pH, ZrO2 samples were prepared by precipitation using the same precursor solutions. The precipitated mixed-metal precursor solutions were adjusted to pH 10.0 using NH4OH solution and then aged under reflux conditions in a round glass flask at 100 °C for different periods (24–240 h). The precipitates were recovered by filtration with excess water and dried at 60 °C. Finally, ZrO2 was obtained by calcination under ambient air for 6 h at 700 °C. The ZrO2 prepared by the precipitation method is denoted as ZrO2-P(y), where y represents the digestion time (i.e., y = 24–240)."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The crystallinities and structural phases of the synthesized oxides were determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a D8 Discover with GADDS X-ray diffractometer (Bruker AXS) using Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range of 3–80° (scan rate = 3° min−1). From the XRD patterns, the crystallite size (D) was calculated using the Scherrer equation (Eq. (1)), where k is the shape factor of the particle (0.89), λ is the X-ray wavelength (0.15406 nm), β is the corrected full width at half maximum (FWHM) in radians, and θ is the Bragg diffraction angle in degree. The crystallite sizes of tetragonal and monoclinic ZrO2 were determined using the peaks at 2θ = 30.2° and 28.3°, respectively. The volume fraction of the monoclinic phase was calculated using the empirical formulae Eqs. (2)–(4) [28,29]. VM and VT are the volume factions, and IM and IT are the peak intensities of the monoclinic and tetragonal phases, respectively. (1) D = k λ / β c o s θ (2) V M = 1.311 X M / 1 + 0.311 X M (3) X M = I M 111 + I M ( 11 1 ¯ ) / I M 111 + I M ( 11 1 ¯ ) + I T 011 (4) V T = 1 - V M N2 sorption experiments were performed using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 analyzer. Elemental analysis was performed using a Thermo Fisher Scientific iCAP 6000 ICP spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed using a TA Instruments SDT Q600 thermal analyzer. The TGA weight losses were further confirmed by differential thermal analysis (DTA) using the same analyzer and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS, Balzers QMS 200). The crystal morphology and average size were determined using a Zeiss Ultra Plus field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) operating at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-2100F microscope operated at 200 kV. The 29Si magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectra were recorded on a 500 MHz Avance III HD Bruker solid-state NMR spectrometer at a spinning rate of 5 kHz, a 29Si frequency of 99.36 MHz with a π/2 rad pulse length of 4 μs, a recycle delay of 60s, and an acquisition of ca. 300 pulse transients. The 29Si chemical shift was reported relative to that of tetramethylsilane. XPS was performed on a PHI Quantera II (Ulvac-PHI) with Al Kα radiation (hν = 1,486.6 eV), and the spectra were calibrated using the binding energy of adventitious carbon (C 1s, 284.6 eV) as a standard. The obtained XPS peaks were decomposed using the Gaussian–Lorentzian curve-fitting method after background subtraction using the Shirley method. The IPA-TPD measurements were performed on a homemade TPD instrument equipped with a QMS, as mentioned above. Before the adsorption of IPA, a sample of ca. 0.1 g was activated in flowing Ar (30 mL min−1) at 300 °C for 1 h. Then, IPA was pulsed to the sample at 25 °C for 0.5 h and subsequently purged with Ar at the same temperature for 0.5 h to remove the physisorbed IPA. The IPA-TPD was obtained in flowing Ar (30 mL min−1) from RT to 500 °C at a ramping rate of 10 °C min−1. The IR spectra of pyridine chemisorbed on the oxide surface were measured on a Thermo Nicolet 6700 Fourier-transform IR (FT-IR) spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using self-supporting oxide wafers of approximately 40 mg (1.3 cm in diameter). Prior to IR measurements, the oxide wafers were pretreated under vacuum at 300 °C for 1 h inside a homemade IR cell, saturated with a pyridine-loaded flow of dry He at 100 °C for 0.2 h, and then evacuated (10−3 Torr) at the same temperature for 0.5 h to remove the physisorbed pyridine. After desorption at 300 °C for 2 h, the concentrations of the Brønsted and Lewis acid sites were determined from the intensities of the IR bands at approximately 1550 and 1450 cm−1, respectively, using the equations of Emeis [30]."
4,DFT calculation,"2.3 DFT calculation DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [31,32]. Blöchl’s projector augmented-wave (PAW) approach was applied for the core–valence interaction [33]. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional based on the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used to model the exchange and correlation behavior of the electrons [34]. The Gaussian smearing method with a width of 0.05 eV was applied to determine the partial occupancies. Spin-polarized computations were performed, where the conjugate gradient algorithm was used for geometric relaxation until the forces on all atoms were < 0.01 eV Å−1. The energy cutoff of the plane-wave expansion was set to 520 eV and a 5 × 5 × 5 Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh was used [35]. The smallest numbers of atoms representing and maintaining the symmetry of the monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2 phases (unit cell) were 12 and 6, respectively. Symmetric supercells containing one Si atom per cell were used to simulate a homogeneous distribution of the Si dopant ions. The supercells used were monoclinic 2 × 1 × 1 and tetragonal 2 × 2 × 1 with 24 atoms, monoclinic 2 × 2 × 1 and tetragonal 2 × 2 × 2 with 48 atoms, and monoclinic 2 × 2 × 2 and tetragonal 2 × 2 × 4 with 96 atoms. The replacement of a single Zr atom with one Si atom in supercells of these three sizes resulted in dopant concentrations of 12.5%, 6.25%, and 3.125%, respectively. To determine the energetic preference of the monoclinic (m) and tetragonal (t) phases in pure and Si-doped ZrO2, we calculated the relative energy of the tetragonal phase with respect to the monoclinic phase using Eq. (5) [36]. E t and E m are the DFT-computed energies of the tetragonal and monoclinic phases, respectively. Thus, a negative Δ E t - m indicates higher stability in the tetragonal phase. To emphasize the direct role of the Si dopant concentration in stabilizing the tetragonal phase, we also calculated the change in the relative energy of the tetragonal phase with respect to the monoclinic phase due to the introduction of the Si dopant, as shown in Eq. (6) [36]. Thus, the negative Δ E S i - P u r e t - m indicates that the Si dopant stabilizes the tetragonal phase over the monoclinic phase more than in the pure ZrO2 case. (5) Δ E t - m = E t - E m (6) Δ E S i - P u r e t - m = E S i t - E S i m - ( E P u r e t - E P u r e m )"
5,Catalysis,"2.4 Catalysis The catalytic dehydration/dehydrogenation of IPA was performed under atmospheric pressure in a continuous-flow apparatus with a fixed-bed microreactor. A sample of ca. 0.1 g was routinely pretreated in flowing Ar (50 mL min−1) at 400 °C for 1 h to remove the physisorbed water and impurities and cooled down to the desired temperature (180–240 °C). The isothermal reaction proceeded with a 3 kPa IPA balanced with N2 at the total flow rate of 50 mL min−1. The WHSV which is defined as mass flow rate of IPA per gram catalyst was 2.4 h−1. The obtained products were analyzed online using a gas chromatograph (Varian 3800) equipped with a CP-Volamine capillary column (60 m × 0.32 mm) and a flame ionization detector. The IPA conversion and selectivity for each product are defined in Eqs. (7) and (8), where F IPA represents the molar flow rate of IPA, and F i and C i denote the molar flow rate and carbon number of the products, respectively. (7) C o n v e r s i o n % = ( F IPA fed - F IPA ) / F IPA fed × 100 (8) S e l e c t i v i t y ( % ) = F i C i / Ʃ F i C i × 100"

7,Physicochemical properties of SZ-x and ZrO2-P(y) catalysts,"3.1 Physicochemical properties of SZ-x and ZrO2-P(y) catalysts Fig. 1 a shows the XRD patterns of the SZ-x catalysts, all of which were calcined in air at 700 °C. The pure ZrO2 prepared by the hydrothermal method without Si incorporation shows characteristic X-ray peaks at 2θ = 24.0°, 28.3°, 31.5°, 34.2°, and 35.4°, which correspond to a monoclinic ZrO2 crystalline structure (JCPDS No. 37–1484). However, as the Si content increases, the crystal structures of the SZ-x catalysts gradually transform into the tetragonal phase with X-ray peaks at 2θ = 30.2°, 35.1°, 50.4°, and 60.2° (JCPDS No. 50–1089). As listed in Table 1 , the SZ-1.3 and SZ-2.5 samples have tetragonal fractions of 63% and 94%, respectively, and the complete transformation to the tetragonal structure is achieved for Si contents exceeding 5 mol% (SZ-5.0). The intensity of the XRD peaks of the tetragonal phase is reduced with further increases in the Si content and it turned to almost amorphous phase when the Si content exceeded 30 mol%. The Si content of the SZ-x samples was close to the initial composition of the precursor solutions, indicating the reliability of the synthesis procedure (Table 1). The crystal structures of the SZ-30.0 and SZ-40.0 samples calcined at temperatures higher than 800 °C changed to the tetragonal phase (Fig. S1). This can be explained by comparing the crystallization temperatures of the hydrous SZ-x samples determined by DTA analysis (Fig. 1c). It is known that the exothermic DTA peaks above 400 °C represent the crystallization of ZrO2 [28,37,38]. The broad endothermic peaks observed in the DTA curves of the 100–300 °C region and the small exothermic peaks at around 300 °C were identified as desorbed water and N2O species, respectively, from all the hydrous SZ-x samples (Fig S2). Pure ZrO2 with a monoclinic structure showed a crystallization temperature of ca. 437 °C, similar to that (443 °C) of monoclinic ZrO2 prepared by the sol–gel method [39]. For pure ZrO2, the formation of a tetragonal structure is possible even at a low temperature of 150 °C and the tetragonal–monoclinic transformation occurs at higher temperatures [39]. However, this structural transformation is retarded by the addition of SiO2 because of the blocking of crystal growth by SiO2. The low expansivity of the SiO2 matrix inhibits the monoclinic transformation and enhances the stability of the tetragonal phase in the mixed oxide [40]. It can be clearly seen that the crystallization temperatures were shifted to higher-temperature regions as the Si content increased; SZ-30.0 and SZ-40.0 exhibited exothermic peaks at 825 and 883 °C, respectively. Thus, the SZ-30.0 and SZ-40.0 samples were amorphous after calcination at 700 °C. As shown in Table 1, the BET surface areas of the SZ-x samples increased from 20 to 150 m2 g−1, while the pore diameters decreased from 21 to 1.9 nm as the Si content increased to 30 mol% (SZ-30.0). It was previously reported that the incorporation of SiO2 into the structure restricts the diffusion of ZrO2 along the matrix, avoiding the nucleation and growth of ZrO2 crystalline particles [41]. Thus, the crystal growth of the bulk region was restricted, while the microstructures were well developed. This correlates well with the changes in the N2 sorption isotherms of the SZ-x samples from type IV (mesoporous) to type I (microporous) according to the IUPAC classification shown in Fig. S3 [42]. Meanwhile, the particle sizes of the SZ-x samples were decreased by the incorporation of Si. As shown in Fig. 1d, the average particle size was decreased from ca. 30 nm (ZrO2) to < 5 nm (SZ-40.0) as the Si content increased. This trend correlates well with the results calculated from XRD using the Scherrer equation (Table 1). The reduction in the crystal size with increasing Si content was further confirmed by the SEM analysis shown in Fig. S4. The ZrO2-P(y) catalysts prepared by the conventional precipitation method exhibited tetragonal phase only regardless of the digestion time (Fig. 1b). The intensities of the X-ray peaks for the ZrO2-P(y) samples decreased as the digestion time increased. Wang et al. reported that the incorporation of Si into hydrous ZrO2 can occur during reflux digestion in a basic solution [43]. Thus, the observation of the tetragonal phase in ZrO2-P(y) samples probably arose from the accidental insertion of Si by the dissolution of glassware. The Si content of ZrO2-P(24) was 7.4% and that of ZrO2-P(240) after 10 days of digestion was 25.7% (Table 1). This indicates that a significant amount of dissolved Si from the glassware affected the physicochemical properties of ZrO2. Similar to the results from the SZ-x samples, the BET surface areas of the ZrO2-P(y) samples also increased from 110 to 270 m2 g−1 as the digestion time increased from 24 to 240 h (Table 1). In addition, the calculated crystallite sizes of the ZrO2-P(y) samples were reduced from 8.6 to 5.8 nm, which also agrees with the case of SZ-x samples. This indicates that the high-surface-area ZrO2 prepared by high-pH precipitation originated from the Si incorporation [24–27]. As shown in Fig. S5, linear correlations between the BET surface areas of both SZ-x and ZrO2-P(y) samples and their DTA peak temperatures (i.e., crystallization temperature) were observed, especially for the SZ-x (x = 0–10.0) and ZrO2-P(y) samples. The deviant BET surface areas of the SZ-x (x = 20.0–40.0) catalysts originated from incomplete crystallization owing to their crystallization temperatures exceeding the calcination temperature. This implies that the DTA peak temperature of hydrous SZ materials can be used as an indicator predicting the BET surface area of crystalline SZ. However, unlike the case of the SZ-x samples, the shape of the N2 sorption isotherms of the ZrO2-P(y) samples did not change significantly with the increase in digestion time (Fig. S6), and the pore volume and diameter of these samples were rather increased (Table 1). This difference in the textural properties may be originated from the different manners of Si addition in the SZ-x and ZrO2-P(y) samples. Unlike the SZ-x catalyst, in which the SZ matrix formed from the beginning of the reaction, the sequential addition of Si with respect to the digestion time broke the formed ZrO2 matrix and generated additional pores. The local structures of Si in SZ-10.0 and ZrO2-P(24) were characterized by 29Si MAS NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S7). The SZ-10.0 and ZrO2-P(24) samples were selected because of their comparable Si contents (8.3 vs. 7.4%) and BET surface areas (120 vs. 110 m2 g−1). Both samples mainly showed two spectral peaks centered at −85 and −115 ppm. The downfield peak was assigned to Si(OSi)2(OH)2 (Q2) and Si(OSi)2(OZr)2 (Q4(2Zr)), while the upfield peak represented the Si(OSi)4 (Q4) signal. The former catalyst had a much higher concentration of Q2 and Q4(2Zr) sites than the latter, probably because of the more homogeneous mixing of Si. However, the Si species in the Q2 and Q4(2Zr) sites were significantly reduced after crystallization to the tetragonal phase. This verifies the inhibition of crystal growth by the SiO2 domain during the crystallization of tetragonal ZrO2. However, the calcined SZ-30.0 and ZrO2-P(240) having similar amounts of Si (27.9 vs. 25.7 mol%) retained dominant Q2 and Q4(2Zr) species because their crystallization temperatures exceeded the calcination temperature (700 °C). Thus, the segregation of ZrO2 particles by the SiO2 domain was incomplete, yielding the formation of very small particles. The acid–base properties of the SZ-x and ZrO2-P(y) samples were characterized by IPA-TPD, as shown in Fig. 2 . Unlike conventional NH3 and CO2-TPD, which characterize the acidic and basic properties of catalysts, respectively, IPA-TPD can measure both acidic and basic properties concurrently [38,44,45]. In this measurement, propylene and acetone were produced by dehydration and dehydrogenation over acid and base sites, respectively. Thus, the fragments of ·C3H5 (m/z = 41) and ·CH3CO (m/z = 43) were used as indicators of the acidic and basic properties of the catalysts, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2a, the peak temperature of ·C3H5 (m/z = 41) desorption over pure monoclinic ZrO2 was 283 °C, indicating the presence of very weak acid sites [38,44,45]. However, the peak temperature of ·C3H5 (m/z = 41) desorption was decreased by the incorporation of Si; SZ-40.0 exhibited the peak temperature of 144 °C. This indicates the presence of a very strong acid site that catalyzes the dehydration of IPA at this low temperature. In addition, the ·C3H5 (m/z = 41) desorption peak was noticeably shifted for the catalysts with Si contents higher than 10.0% (i.e., SZ-10.0). Although the base strength also increased with Si addition, the area of the ·CH3CO (m/z = 43) peak around 300 °C became almost negligible as the Si content increased (Fig. 2b). Similar to the results from the SZ-x samples, the peak temperatures of ·C3H5 (m/z = 41) desorption over ZrO2-P(y) samples decreased from 236 to 175 °C as the digestion time increased from 24 to 240 h (Fig. 2c). Notably, the samples (SZ-10.0 vs. ZrO2-P(24) and SZ-30 vs. ZrO2-P(240)) with comparable Si contents exhibited similar peak temperatures of ·C3H5 (m/z = 41) desorption. Thus, the desorption peak temperature of ·C3H5 (m/z = 41) can be an indicator of the Si content in the SZ samples. IR spectroscopy with adsorbed pyridine can distinguish between Brønsted and Lewis acid sites on catalysts [46]. Fig. 3 a shows the pyridine-adsorbed IR spectra of calcined SZ-x samples measured at 300 °C in the range 1400–1700 cm−1. The calculated concentrations of both types of acid sites are listed in Table S1. Pure monoclinic ZrO2 has only Lewis acid sites with 38.0 μmol g−1, while Brønsted acid sites were generated over the SZ-x samples with Si contents of >10 mol%. Thus, the noticeable shift of the ·C3H5 (m/z = 41) desorption peaks in the IPA-TPD of SZ-x samples (x = 10.0–40.0) shown in Fig. 2a can be explained by the generation of Brønsted acid sites. The concentration of Lewis acid sites was maximized on the SZ-10.0 sample and gradually decreased with further increases in Si content. However, a steady increase in Brønsted acidity with the incorporation of Si was observed on SZ-x with x = 10.0–40.0. Thus, the concentration of total acid sites was maximized for the SZ-20.0 catalyst. Fig. 3b shows the IR spectra of the calcined SZ-x samples in the hydroxyl vibration region of 3600–4000 cm−1. The pure monoclinic ZrO2 exhibited bands centered at ca. 3679 and 3770 cm−1, corresponding to the stretching vibrations of the terminal and bridging hydroxyls in ZrO2 [5]. In line with the increase in Si content in the SZ-x catalysts, a new band centered at 3739 cm−1 corresponding to the Si–OH stretching vibration was observed, and the bands related to Zr–OH were reduced. Wang et al. reported that the Brønsted acidity in SZ catalysts originated from the generation of Si–OH groups with nearby Zr species [47]. Thus, the high concentration of Brønsted acid sites in SZ-x samples (x = 10.0–40.0), as shown in Fig. 3a, can be explained by the generation of Si–OH species. In addition, the decrease in the Zr–OH bands in the SZ-x catalysts with higher Si content corresponds to the monoclinic–tetragonal phase transformation, as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 4 shows the XPS spectra of the three major elements (Zr, Si, and O) in the SZ-x catalysts. The Si contents determined from XPS analysis were close to the values analyzed by ICP (Table 1), indicating the homogeneity of the solid mixtures. The peaks of Zr 3d, Si 2p, and O 1s were decomposed using the FWHM of 1.6, 1.7, and 1.8 eV, respectively, and the relative abundance and binding energy of each element are summarized in Table S2. The Zr 3d 5/2 peaks of all the SZ-x samples were decomposed into the species Zr(OH) x and ZrO2. The binding energies of Zr 3d 5/2 in pure monoclinic ZrO2 were observed at 183.2 and 181.7 eV, which are well correlated to previously reported values [48]. Because of the relatively higher electronegativity of Si (1.90) than Zr (1.33), the electron density of Zr in Zr–O–Si bonds is lower than that in Zr–O–Zr bonds. As a result, the binding energies of the Zr 3d 5/2 orbital in both Zr(OH) x and ZrO2 species, centered at 183.2 and 181.7 eV, respectively in pure monoclinic ZrO2, are linearly increased with the incorporation of Si. For the same reason, much lower Si 2p binding energies for Si(OH) x and SiO2 were observed for all SZ-x catalysts compared to those in pure SiO2, which were centered at 105.8 and 103.5 eV, respectively [49]. The binding energies of Si 2p for both Si(OH) x and SiO2 decreased as the Si content decreased. As shown in Fig. 4c and Table S2, the O 1s spectra of the SZ-x catalysts were decomposed into three peaks, namely, hydroxyls (531.7 eV), lattice 1 (Zr–O–Zr, 529.9 eV), and lattice 2 (Zr–O–Si or Si–O–Si, 533.0 eV). In line with the increase in Si addition, the binding energies of O 1s for hydroxyls and lattice 1 peaks were slightly increased with increases in Si content up to 10 mol%, at which point they leveled off. On the contrary, the O 1s peak for the lattice 2 species was observed only for the samples with Si contents higher than 10 mol%. In addition, the remarkable increase in the number of hydroxyl groups in the O 1s spectra of the SZ-x catalysts with x = 10.0–40.0 correlated well with the increase in the number of Brønsted acid sites on the corresponding catalysts, as shown in Fig. 3 and Table S1. The generation of Brønsted acid sites on Zr–OH–Si has already been reported [45]. Furthermore, the generation of Brønsted acidity in the SiO2–ZrO2 binary system was logically predicted based on the hypothesis of calculating the excess negative or positive charge in a model structure [50]. In other words, an SiO2–ZrO2 binary system with abundant Si generates Brønsted acidity, whereas one rich in Zr forms Lewis acidity (Scheme 1 )."
8,DFT calculations,"3.2 DFT calculations To investigate the effect of Si incorporation on the stability of the tetragonal and monoclinic phases in the ZrO2 crystal, DFT calculations were performed within a consistent framework. The optimized monoclinic 2 × 1 × 1 and tetragonal 2 × 2 × 1 supercells with a Si dopant atom are shown in Fig. 5 a, b. The optimization energy–volume curves of all the supercells are shown in Fig. S8. The relative energy of the tetragonal phase with respect to the monoclinic phase as a function of Si concentration is presented in Fig. 5c. Moreover, the change in the relative energies caused only by the presence of the Si dopant is presented in Fig. 5d, which demonstrates that Si doping preferentially induces tetragonal phase formation. In the case of pure ZrO2, the monoclinic phase is ~0.11 eV per formula unit more stable than the tetragonal phase. Therefore, in pure ZrO2, the monoclinic phase is considered to be the ground energy state, which is consistent with the experimental results in which the monoclinic phase is observed at low temperatures. As shown in Fig. 5c, d, the stability of the tetragonal phase increases with increasing Si concentration. At 12.5% doping concentration, the tetragonal phase is ~0.05 eV per formula unit more stable than the monoclinic phase. This indicates that the tetragonal phase is predominant above a certain concentration of Si. To analyze the geometric effects on the phase stability order with the presence of the Si dopant, we also investigated the Si–O bond structure. In monoclinic ZrO2, the coordination number of Zr is seven, and our optimized structure shows the Zr–O bond length range 2.06–2.29 Å. However, in tetragonal ZrO2, the coordination number of Zr is eight and the optimized Zr–O bond lengths are 2.08 Å and 2.42 Å. As shown in Fig. 5a, the incorporation of the Si dopant into monoclinic ZrO2 crystal results in the bonding of each Si atom to five neighboring oxygen atoms; the Si–O bond lengths are 1.73–1.84 Å in length and OSiO bond angles are 79.60°–156.86°. Meanwhile, in a tetragonal ZrO2 crystal (Fig. 5b), the Si atom is bonded to four neighboring oxygen atoms with SiO bond lengths of 1.69 Å and OSiO bond angles of 107.76° and 112.94°. Therefore, in the tetragonal phase, the geometrical environment around the Si atom is closer to that in the calculated quartz structure of SiO2, where the SiO bond lengths are 1.63 Å and OSiO bond angles are 108.90°–110.50° [51]. This explains the high tendency of the Si dopant to induce the formation of the tetragonal ZrO2 phase."
9,Catalytic properties of SZ-x,"3.3 Catalytic properties of SZ-x Fig. 6 shows the conversion of IPA and the selectivity to propylene and acetone as a function of the reaction temperature over the SZ-x catalysts during the dehydration and dehydrogenation of IPA as a test reaction. Pure ZrO2 is almost inactive for the decomposition of IPA, with a small amount of acetone produced at temperatures up to 200 °C and the formation of propylene was observed at the temperatures higher than 200 °C. As illustrated in Scheme 1, the dehydrogenation of IPA to acetone proceeds over ZrO2 via the combined activity of Lewis acid (Zr4+) and Lewis base (O2−) while the dehydration of IPA to propylene over Si-ZrO2 proceeds mainly by the Brønsted acid generated by SiOH. The SZ-x catalysts with x = 0–5.0 exhibited low conversions of IPA (<7%) even at 240 °C, and the major product was acetone. However, the conversions of IPA over SZ-x catalysts with x = 20.0–40.0 increased almost proportionally with temperature up to 240 °C. In addition, the major product of these catalysts was propylene, indicating that high IPA conversion was achieved by dehydration over the Brønsted acid sites. This agrees with the noticeable increase in Brønsted acid sites on SZ-x catalysts with x = 10.0–40.0, as shown in Fig. 3 and Table S1. In addition, the high surface areas (120–140 m2 g−1) of the catalysts shown in Table 1 have a synergistic effect on the conversion of IPA. Although SZ-x catalysts with x = 20.0–40.0 exhibited higher conversions of IPA than the other catalysts, the formation of acetone was not observed over all temperature ranges (180–240 °C), indicating the absence of base sites on these catalysts. This also agrees with the absence of high-temperature desorption peaks of ·CH3CO (m/z = 43) around 200–300 °C, corresponding to the presence of base sites on the catalysts (Fig. 2b). However, as shown in Fig. S9, a small amount (5–13%) of diisopropyl ether (DIPE) was produced over the SZ-x catalysts with x = 20.0–30.0, especially at low temperatures (180–210 °C). The evolution of DIPE on these catalysts was also observed in the IPA-TPD (Fig. S10). Heese et al. reported favorable conditions for the synthesis of DIPE from a mixed feed of propylene and IPA over an ion exchange resin [52]. The high density of Brønsted acid sites and the propylene/IPA molar ratio of 1.0 was optimal for the synthesis of DIPE. Thus, both the high acid density and the high selectivity to propylene favor the synthesis of DIPE over the SZ-x catalysts with x = 20.0–30.0. The ZrO2-P(y) catalysts exhibited trends in IPA conversion similar to those of the SZ-x catalysts (Fig. S11). Notably, SZ-10.0 and ZrO2-P(24) with comparable amounts of Si (8.3 vs. 7.4% in Table 1) have similar IPA conversions (32% vs. 34%). This indicates that the enhanced activity of the ZrO2-P(y) catalysts mainly originated from the accidental incorporation of Si during the synthetic procedure."
10,Conclusions,"The changes in the physicochemical properties of ZrO2 with the addition of Si were systematically investigated by comparing the intentionally synthesized SZ-x and the accidentally synthesized ZrO2-P(y) series of mixed oxides. The monoclinic–tetragonal phase transformation induced by the addition of Si was experimentally confirmed by the XRD patterns of the SZ-x and ZrO2-P(y) catalysts. An increase in the crystallization temperature was observed for the SZ-x catalysts as the Si content increased. Together with the phase transformation, the addition of Si to the ZrO2 structure led to an increase in the surface area and acidity of the catalysts, which was favorable for catalytic applications. The generation of Brønsted acid sites by the addition of Si was observed by IR spectroscopy with pyridine adsorption over the SZ-x catalysts. In addition, the stabilization of the tetragonal structure by Si doping was theoretically demonstrated by DFT calculations. The acid–base properties of the SZ-x catalysts were studied using the dehydration/dehydrogenation of IPA as a model reaction. The catalysts with Brønsted acidity were active for the dehydration of IPA to propylene, whereas those with Lewis acidity had very low activity for the dehydrogenation of IPA to acetone. The overall results of this study can provide useful guidelines for both the synthesis of ZrO2 catalysts and the development of ZrO2-based acid catalysts."
