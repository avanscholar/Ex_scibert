0,Introduction,"Finite fossil fuel reserves and the increasing CO2 level in the Earth’s atmosphere are reasons to identify and develop sustainable sources of energy, fuels, and chemicals. As a result, substantial research efforts in recent years have been directed towards the processing of biomass to fuels [1] or chemicals [2]. The first step is the conversion of the solid biomass into a gas or a liquid that can be processed easily. One efficient method to obtain a liquid “bio-oil” is fast pyrolysis [3,4]. The properties of the product of this process depend on the biomass used and the conditions applied [3–5]. Generally, the “oils” are actually aqueous-organic systems with a high oxygen content that is not compatible with existing refinery operations, making additional upgrading steps necessary [3,6]. The oils contain short oxygenates, mainly derived from the cellulosic part of biomass, and 2–20 wt.% phenolic compounds [7] derived from the lignin part of biomass. The latter have been the target of catalytic conversion to hydrocarbons by hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) for the production of fuels. Much of the initial effort in biomass conversion focused on model compounds; and molecules such as phenol, anisole, cresol [8–11] and guaiacol [12] have posed as test substrates for catalytic HDO, because they bear the typical functionalities present in the pool of molecules obtained through lignin breakdown. HDO has been conducted both in the vapor phase and in the liquid phase, and base metal, noble metal, and transition metal sulfide catalysts have been tested [13]. Reaction kinetics have been investigated, and reaction networks for several compounds have been formulated on the basis of the results [14–17]. Phenol itself can also serve as a precursor of cyclohexanone, which is used to manufacture caprolactam and adipic acid to ultimately make nylon [18]. Because of the importance of this route, there is a substantial amount of 20th century literature on catalytic phenol hydrogenation, considering both vapor phase and liquid phase processing [19–21]. To progress towards more realistic feedstocks, mixtures of reactants have to be considered as well as the presence of other components in bio-oils that are difficult to separate or convert. Components that are not the target reactants can act as solvents [22–24]. Beyond traditional solvent effects, additional components can affect the solubility of hydrogen, interact or even react with reactants or products, or compete for adsorption sites on the catalyst [25]. Solvent effects have been identified as very important in a variety of oxygenate conversions for upgrading of biomass-derived feedstocks [26,27]. Research on solvent effects is further motivated by the fact that crude bio-oil may separate into an aqueous phase and an organic phase, which opens up the possibility of biphasic processing [28,29]. In isolated cases, the response of catalysts toward bio-oil components that are not the target reactants has been tested [30,31]; such components may also have deleterious [32] or positive effects [33] on the catalyst stability, or be without much influence [34]. Regarding the hydrogenation or hydrodeoxygenation of phenolics, very few reports address solvent effects [35–37]. The goal of this work is to investigate the effect of other bio-oil components on the hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation of phenolic compounds. The simplest molecule among the lignin-derived molecules is phenol itself, and although it is more soluble in organic solvents than in water (as evident from an octanol-water partition coefficient of log P = 1.5), aqueous phase processing has been emphasized. The most commonly used catalysts are noble metals, such as palladium or platinum [38,39]. Recent literature generally reports that hydrogenation of the aromatic ring of phenolic compounds first leads to cyclohexanones, which are subsequently converted to cyclohexanols [38–41]. Much earlier, Smith and Stump [19] presented a slightly different mechanism in which cyclohexanone is not a true intermediate. Cyclohexenols form on the surface and are further hydrogenated or tautomerize into cyclohexanone, which is then found in the reaction mixture. Some authors have added acid to dehydrate the formed cyclohexanols to cyclohexenes, which are then hydrogenated to cycloalkanes on metal sites [38]. However, Ohta et al. [42] reported that carbon-supported platinum catalysts are capable of hydrodeoxygenation of phenols in aqueous phase in the absence of acids. The authors proposed that Pt/C catalyzes hydrogenolysis of the C–O bond in cyclohexanols. One class of components present in high concentrations in the liquid products of pyrolysis is that of aliphatic alcohols. Alcohols can reach concentrations around 8.5 wt. % [6] and are difficult to separate from bio-oils. For example, methanol and ethylene glycol can be present in concentrations of several percent. Moreover, it has been proposed to add methanol to bio-oil for its stabilization [43,44]. In light of these considerations, this work focuses on short chain alcohols and their effect on the reaction network of phenol hydrogenation in aqueous phase with carbon-supported platinum as catalyst."
1,Experimental and ab initio calculation methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Phenol (99%), cyclohexanone (≥ 99.5%), methanol (≥ 99.8%), ethanol (≥ 99.5%), 1-propanol (≥ 99.5%), 2-propanol (≥ 99.5%), formic acid (80% in water), benzene (≥99.8%), toluene (99.8%), and n-dodecane (≥ 99%) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich Company. All chemicals were used without further purification. Platinum on carbon (5 wt. % loading, 205931-Aldrich) was used as catalyst. CO, N2, and H2 were UHP grade from Airgas Company."
3,Catalytic tests,"2.2 Catalytic tests The catalytic experiments were conducted in batch mode in a custom design Parr reactor of 300 ml volume. Quantitative analysis of the composition of the reaction mixture was performed by attenuated total reflection (ATR) IR spectroscopy. A Mettler-Toledo Sentinel™ DiComp™ High Pressure ATR –IR probe was connected to a ReactIR™ iC10 module with a K4 conduit. The ATR-IR probe was integrated into the reactor side wall to avoid that catalyst particles settle into the cavity of the probe, right above the crystal, which is a problem of bottom-mounted probes and can lead to an overestimation of the reaction rate that is derived from the ATR spectra [45]. The lid of the reactor was equipped with a pressure transducer. In a typical experiment, 120 ml of solvent and 60 mg of catalyst were charged into the reactor. The reactor was then purged five times with H2. Subsequently, the reactor was pressurized with 200 psi H2 and heated from room temperature to the reaction temperature of 353 K (resulting in a pressure rise to about 250 psi), and kept at this temperature for 10 min before the IR background was collected. The reaction was started by injection of the reactant or the catalyst as indicated in the figure captions. IR spectra were collected every 5 min. Temperature and pressure were computer-monitored every 5 s through ParrCom software; the pressure resolution was 1 psi. The agitator speed was 700 rpm. Hydrogenation of benzene or toluene was performed in a biphasic mixture of water and dodecane, since the solubility of benzene and toluene in water is low. The dissolved reactants and hydrogenation products (phenol, cyclohexanone, and cyclohexanol) were identified by characteristic vibrations. The IR band intensity was proportional to the concentration of the substance, and calibration curves were established at a temperature of 353 K, using water as the solvent and the following vibrational frequencies (±2 cm−1): phenol, 1597 cm−1, cyclohexanone 1692 cm−1, and cyclohexanol 1058 cm−1. After completion of the catalytic reaction, the reactor was cooled to room temperature, and the liquid products were analyzed with an Agilent 5820A-5957 GC–MS operated with helium as the carrier gas. A HP-5MS 30 m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm capillary column was used. In the aqueous fraction, only hydrogenation products could be identified. Thirty ml of dodecane was stirred into the reaction mixture to collect products insoluble in water. Cyclohexane, the hydrodeoxygenation product, was identified in the recovered dodecane fraction."
4,In situ ATR-IR spectroscopy,"2.3 In situ ATR-IR spectroscopy A Harrick Horizon Multiple Reflection ATR Accessory was used together with a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 FTIR spectrometer. The catalyst was coated onto the zinc selenide crystal by immersion in water and subsequent drying. The catalyst was then exposed to liquid mixtures of methanol and water at temperatures between 25 °C and 80 °C while gas was flowing through the reaction chamber. The gas was N2, H2, or air. Spectra were recorded of the immersed and the dried catalyst, thus representing the solid-liquid or the solid-vapor interface, and the present fluid."
5,Ab initio calculations,"2.4 Ab initio calculations Calculations of adsorption energies and preferred adsorption geometries for phenol, cyclohexanone, methanol, and other relevant molecular species on the Pt(111) surface were performed with ab initio density-functional theory (DFT), the PBE generalized gradient-corrected exchange-correlation functionals, the projector augmented wave (PAW) method, and a plane-wave basis set [46–50]. The van der Waals (vdW) corrections proposed by Grimme et al. (D3) [51] and by Tkatchenko and Scheffler (TS) [52] were added to the conventional DFT calculations that do not include vdW corrections (referred to as conventional DFT hereafter). The Pt(111) surface was modeled by a repeated supercell with a slab of Pt atoms, separated by a vacuum region of 12.7 Å. The slab consisted of five Pt layers with each layer containing 25 Pt atoms in the supercell (a 5 × 5 surface unit cell). The Pt atoms were initially located at their bulk positions with a calculated lattice constant of 3.98 Å (conventional DFT), 3.92 Å (DFT with the D3 vdW corrections, hereafter DFT-D3), or 3.93 Å (DFT with the TS vdW corrections, hereafter DFT-TS). In order to calculate the adsorption of a molecule, a single molecule was initially placed on top of the Pt slab (at various positions near the surface). Each configuration was then optimized via a conjugate-gradient technique using the total energy and the Hellmann-Feynman forces on the atoms [46]. For all the optimization calculations, the Pt atoms of the bottom two layers were fixed while the Pt atoms on the surface of the top three layers and all the atoms of the molecule were allowed to move. A plane-wave energy cutoff of 400 eV and two special k points in the irreducible part of the two-dimensional Brillouin zone of the 5 × 5 surface cell were used for all the calculations."
6,Results of experiments and ab initio calculations,
7,Analysis of spectral and pressure data and exclusion of transport limitations,"3.1 Analysis of spectral and pressure data and exclusion of transport limitations The main products of phenol conversion on Pt/C were cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol, and the main product of cyclohexanone conversion was cyclohexanol. The IR band intensity of the characteristic vibrations of these molecules was analyzed as a function of time to measure the reaction progress (Figure S1). Using the IR intensity calibration curves and accounting only for these three molecules, the concentrations generally added to 100 ± 10% of the desired reactant concentration. Total pressure was also monitored over the course of the reaction. The effect of pressure on the solubility of H2 in water and several other solvents is reported to be linear in the pressure range of 0.5–1.5 MPa, consistent with Henry’s law [53]. The fraction of H2 dissolved in water is in the low percent range under the conditions applied. Because of the linear relationship and the relatively insignificant vapor pressure of water (≈7 psi at 353 K), the evolution of the total pressure can be used as a measure of H2 consumption (Fig. 1 a). When water was used as a solvent, the phenol concentration decreased linearly during the first 100 min (Fig. 1a). During this reaction period, the total pressure dropped from 250 to 175 psi, or by 30%. Thus, there was no influence of the H2 pressure on the reaction kinetics, indicating that neither hydrogen transport to the catalyst surface nor hydrogen adsorption was rate limiting. Phenol conversion in water had the highest H2 consumption rate of all investigated reactions, hence hydrogen transport limitation could also be excluded in all other catalytic experiments."
8,Phenol and cyclohexanone hydrogenation in pure water,"3.2 Phenol and cyclohexanone hydrogenation in pure water The Pt/C catalyst showed very high activity for hydrogenation of phenol in pure water, even under the applied mild conditions of 353 K and 250 psi H2, as seen in Fig. 1a. All IR bands of phenol disappeared within 3 h (Figure S1). For about 100 min, the phenol concentration decreased linearly, consistent with zero-order reaction kinetics (Fig. 1). The intensity of the carbonyl vibration of cyclohexanone at 1695 cm−1 first increased and then decreased with reaction time, resulting in a concentration-time-profile typical of an intermediate product. This observation was confirmed by GCMS. The highest yield of cyclohexanone was reached at about 150 min. Afterwards, both the IR bands of phenol and cyclohexanone decreased with time, indicating that the hydrogenation of phenol and cyclohexanone occurred simultaneously on Pt/C in water. Cyclohexanol selectivity was finite and not zero at 0% conversion, as Fig. 1b shows. When phenol was consumed after about 170 min, the formation of cyclohexanol accelerated noticeably. The cyclohexanol concentration finally leveled off after about 8 h. Cyclohexane, the hydrodeoxygenation product, was also detected at the end of the reaction but the yield was less than 3%. Because cyclohexanone accumulated and its formation requires fewer hydrogen equivalents than complete ring hydrogenation, the phenol and pressure curves were not congruent during the course of the reaction (Fig. 1)."
9,The effect of aliphatic alcohols on the hydrogenation of aromatic compounds and cyclohexanone on Pt/C in aqueous phase,"3.3 The effect of aliphatic alcohols on the hydrogenation of aromatic compounds and cyclohexanone on Pt/C in aqueous phase The presence of methanol in water strongly suppressed the hydrogenation of phenol on Pt/C (Fig. 2 ). In fact, Pt/C showed almost no activity over a period of 5 h in a reaction medium consisting of 10 wt. % CH3OH in H2O. Addition of only 2.5 g methanol into 120 g water (2 wt.% CH3OH) already had a strong negative effect on the hydrogenation of phenol. The conversion of phenol was about 15% after 5 h, and the initial reaction rate was only 30% of that with water as solvent (Table 1 ). The in-situ IR spectra indicated a halt in conversion after a short time, consistent with deactivation of the Pt/C catalyst. Cyclohexanol was the only observed product. Ethanol or 1-propanol (in concentrations of 10 wt.% alcohol in H2O) were found to have a similar suppressing effect on the hydrogenation of phenol on Pt/C (not shown). Because cyclohexanone appears as an intermediate during phenol hydrogenation on Pt/C, the effect of alcohols on the hydrogenation of cyclohexanone was also investigated. Pt/C showed activity in a 20 wt. % CH3OH in H2O mixture for the hydrogenation of cyclohexanone to cyclohexanol, but the reaction rate was about half of that measured with pure water as solvent (Fig. 2b). To elucidate whether the deactivation of the ring hydrogenation pathway in water-methanol mixtures is unique to phenol or a general phenomenon, benzene and toluene hydrogenation were investigated. Because of the limited solubility of these reactants in water, a biphasic reaction system with water and dodecane as solvents was used. In the presence of 8 wt.% methanol in the aqueous phase, no hydrogenation of benzene or toluene was observed (as shown in Fig. 3 ). Since only 2 wt.% CH3OH already had a strong effect on phenol hydrogenation, normal solvent effects on transition state and also on solubility could be excluded. The fact that both aromatics and cyclohexanone conversion are affected by the presence of methanol suggests poisoning of the catalyst surface rather than reaction of methanol with the reactant, thus raising the question whether methanol itself or a product formed from methanol is responsible (see Section 4). In addition, the observation of complete inhibition in the case of phenol and partial inhibition in the case of cyclohexanone suggests that ring hydrogenation and carbonyl hydrogenation have different demands with respect to site geometry."
10,Hypothesis of CO formation and experiments testing the same,"3.4 Hypothesis of CO formation and experiments testing the same It is known that on the Pt(111) surface, methanol can be reformed to yield CO [54–56], which adheres strongly and desorbs only at 473 K [54]. The chemistry of other primary alcohols such as ethanol and 1-propanol on platinum is similar to that of methanol. Adsorbed ethanol is dehydrogenated to acetaldehyde, which cleaves to give a methyl group and CO [57–59]. Hence, the inhibiting effect of alcohols on the hydrogenation of aromatic rings and carbonyl groups may be due to site blocking by CO formed through alcohol decomposition. To test this hypothesis, two types of experiments were conducted: the effect of a CO-generating additive and CO itself on the reaction progress was investigated (Fig. 4 ), and the surface of Pt/C in the reaction medium was monitored by IR spectroscopy (Fig. 5 ). It is well known that formic acid readily decomposes to CO on the surface of platinum [60]. When a small amount of formic acid was present in the water (0.7 wt.%), only a fraction of the phenol was hydrogenated within 10 h (Fig. 4). When CO gas (5 psi) was added to the reactor (using water as solvent), the hydrogenation of phenol completely stopped. To corroborate CO formation on the surface of Pt/C, the catalyst powder was coated onto an ATR crystal and then heated in a water-methanol mixture while H2 was flowing through the reaction chamber (Fig. 5). When the catalyst was immersed in water (spectrum 1), the expected vibrations of water were seen. The stretching vibrations produced a broad band with maxima at about 3375 and 3245 cm−1 (not shown) while the deformation vibration produced a band at 1632 cm−1. The addition of methanol led to a strong CO vibration at 1016 cm−1. The first overtone of this band falls into the range where the fundamental vibrations of CO adsorbed on platinum would be expected, and indeed this overtone was seen at 2014 cm−1 whenever methanol was present. The absorbance in the range above 2000 cm−1 increased during heating of the catalyst in the presence of methanol and H2, but discrete bands were difficult to identify. Therefore, the solvent mixture was evaporated at the reaction temperature to unambiguously identify CO. As spectrum 4 in Fig. 5 shows, a band at 2042 cm−1 with a broad shoulder towards lower wavenumbers remained after methanol was removed. The position is consistent with CO adsorption on step sites of platinum [61]. When air was admitted to the reaction chamber, the band disappeared readily, as expected. Poisoning occurred rapidly in the experiments in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. To produce CO more slowly and delay complete surface coverage, a secondary alcohol, 2-propanol, was chosen. CO formation, while principally possible from 2-propanol [62,63] is more difficult in this case, because it requires breaking two CC bonds as opposed to one in a primary alcohol. When a mixture of 20 wt.% 2-propanol in H2O was used as the solvent (Fig. 6 ), the rate of hydrogenation of phenol was slightly higher than that in water (Table 1). However, the hydrogenation rate of cyclohexanone was slower than that in water implying that some inhibition occurred. Initial rates are summarized in Table 2 . As shown in Fig. 6, the fast phenol hydrogenation combined with slow cyclohexanone hydrogenation resulted in a high maximum yield of cyclohexanone, about 20% higher than that in water (Table 1). Increasing the concentration of 2-propanol was expected to result in higher CO coverage on platinum. Indeed, Pt/C showed no activity in phenol hydrogenation when neat 2-propanol was used as the solvent."
11,Testing for irreversible adsorption,"3.5 Testing for irreversible adsorption The zero order kinetics indicate strong adsorption of phenol, and desorption of CO from platinum is known to occur only at temperatures significantly above the reaction temperature of 353 K. Hence, the observed kinetics could be affected by irreversible adsorption of some species. In such a case, the sequence of adding ingredients to the reaction mixture should play a role and may be exploited to prevent poisoning. Indeed, if the reaction of phenol in a methanol-water mixture was started by addition of the catalyst (Fig. 7 ) instead of by addition of the reactant (Fig. 2), then phenol was completely converted, indicating that methanol-derived poisoning could not take effect on phenol hydrogenation. The hydrogenation rate of phenol was very close to that in neat water (Table 1), while the subsequent hydrogenation of cyclohexanone to cyclohexanol was slower than in water, similar to the results in Fig. 2. The hydrogenation of cyclohexanone in methanol-water mixtures was little affected by the addition sequence (Table 2). However, when phenol was introduced during the ongoing conversion of cyclohexanone in CH3OH-H2O, cyclohexanone hydrogenation stopped (Fig. 8 ). Moreover, phenol itself was not hydrogenated."
12,Results of ab initio calculations,"3.6 Results of ab initio calculations Table 3 summarizes the binding geometries and binding energies for phenol, cyclohexanone, and other relevant molecules with the Pt(111) surface, obtained from ab initio DFT calculations with and without vdW corrections. Benzene was included as a well-investigated aromatic molecule. Parallel adsorption geometry was found to be the most stable configuration for aromatic compounds on Pt(111), resulting in interaction of phenol with four surface atoms (Fig. 9 a). Adsorption energies for phenol spanned 142–245 kJ/mol depending on whether vdW corrections were included. Cyclohexanone was found to be oriented perpendicular to the surface, and interacted with 1–2 surface sites only (Fig. 9b). The binding energy was much lower (by about 100 kJ/mol) than that of phenol. Methanol, which was investigated as a representative of the R−OH family and as a solvent and possibly competing adsorbate, connected only with a single platinum atom in a slanted geometry (Fig. 9c) and adsorbed more weakly than both phenol and cyclohexanone. CO adsorption energies on Pt(111) were nearly independent of the calculation method. High values were computed for both on-top and hollow sites, between 172 and 198 kJ/mol and thus above the uncorrected and below the vdW-corrected energies for aromatics adsorption. Notwithstanding its tight binding to platinum, CO may diffuse across the surface. The nudged elastic band method was used to calculate the diffusion barrier with conventional DFT from one FCC site to another for a single CO molecule on Pt (111) [64,65]. Two diffusion pathways were chosen, one passing through the on-top site and the other passing through bridge-hcp-bridge sites, as shown in Fig. 10 . Both pathways have very small values for the diffusion barrier, 6 and 28 kJ/mol, respectively. Although the binding energy of CO on Pt is high, CO diffusion is facile."
13,Discussion,
14,"Adsorption of reactants, products and solvents on platinum","4.1 Adsorption of reactants, products and solvents on platinum To understand the kinetics of phenol hydrogenation, the surface chemistry of hydrogen, phenol, cyclohexanone, alcohols and water on platinum is relevant. When H2 adsorbs on platinum, it dissociates to H atoms, which are the active species in the catalytic hydrogenation. The initial and integral heats of adsorption for hydrogen adsorption on supported Pt surfaces are about 90 kJ/mol and 65 kJ/mol per H atom, respectively [66]. On the flat Pt(111) surface, phenol has a preferred adsorption configuration with the ring closely parallel to the surface and the hydroxy group tilted away from the surface, as the computations here and in the literature show consistently [67–69]. The parallel adsorption geometry of phenol requires a site with an ensemble of four atoms. Computations [70] and experiments [71] show that phenol dissociates easily (at a temperature of 200 K) to give phenoxy, which also prefers an η5-π geometry with the oxygen pointing away from the surface [71]. There is less consensus with respect to the adsorption energy of phenol, with calculated values of 111 [70,72], 172 [69], 180 [73] and 215 kJ/mol [67] reported in the literature and a span of 142 to 245 kJ/mol computed here with and without vdW corrections. Recent experiments delivered an initial heat of adsorption for phenol on Pt(111) of 220 kJ/mol [74]. Conventional DFT without vdW corrections thus significantly underestimates the binding energy, and not all vdW corrections lead to a match with experimental observations [75]. The values closest to the experimental heats of adsorption, also for benzene (exp. 197 kJ/mol [76]), were obtained with DFT-TS (Table 3). As a ketone, cyclohexanone adsorbs on platinum via its CO group (Fig. 9b). The DFT calculations show that cyclohexanone does not require a complex site; it is bound via its carbonyl oxygen to one Pt atom, with one hydrogen pointing toward a second Pt atom. This finding is consistent with the reported preferred η1(O) end-on configuration of acetone on Pt(111) [77,78]. Previous DFT calculations showed that the adsorption energy of acetone on Pt (111) is about 45–50 kJ/mol−1 for the η1(O) geometry [79,80], which is close to the value of 45 kJ/mol obtained for cyclohexanone without vdW correction (Table 3). The relatively low adsorption energies for ketones on the platinum surface are in agreement with low desorption temperatures of 185 K and 200 K for acetone [81] and cyclohexanone [82]. The interaction of alcohols with Pt(111) increases with increasing alkyl chain length, thus making methanol the weakest adsorbate [81]. Cyclohexanol has been described as interacting via the oxygen and its aliphatic moiety [62], and would be expected to adhere more strongly than methanol. It is, however, believed to desorb readily once formed [70]. A similar compound, methylcyclohexanol was found to desorb more easily than methylcylohexanone if water was present [37]. For CO adsorption on the Pt surface, DFT calculations generally indicate that CO should prefer hollow- to on-top-site adsorption on Pt(111), in apparent contradiction to experimental studies [83]. However, both adsorption energies in Table 3 are in reasonable agreement with the measured heat of adsorption of 206 kJ/mol [84]. The conclusion of a very small barrier for CO diffusion on Pt (111) is not affected by the fact that DFT and experiment give different preferred binding sites. The most abundant species in the mixture, that is, water molecules, bind more weakly than any other species in the reaction mixture, as calculated adsorption energies on Pt(111) are between 24 and 41 kJ/mol [85]. Consistently, the measured activation energy for desorption is 42.3 kJ/mol, and the desorption temperature is 170 K. Recent computational work [37,69] suggests that water may affect the adsorption of phenolics and their hydrogenation products. It is estimated that the adsorption of phenol becomes 10–20 kJ/mol weaker in the presence of water [69]. Water also facilitates certain surface reaction steps [37], but since water was always present in our experiments, this effect is not considered relevant. In conclusion, phenol requires a large ensemble site and should be most susceptible to a strongly interacting co-adsorbate such as CO, whereas cyclohexanone conversion should be less affected, as is indeed the case. Assuming solvent effects do not upset relative energetics, methanol and other alcohols do not interact strongly enough to displace phenol and cannot act as poisons themselves. Water is the weakest competitor."
15,Hydrogenation of phenol and cyclohexanone on Pt/C in pure water,"4.2 Hydrogenation of phenol and cyclohexanone on Pt/C in pure water On the flat Pt(111) surface, phenol adsorbs more strongly than all other species. Indeed, the zero-order disappearance (Fig. 1a) suggests that phenol coverage on the actives sites remains largely constant for most of the reaction time. The catalytic data further indicate that there are two pathways to cyclohexanol, a direct one from phenol and an indirect one via cyclohexanone. Extrapolation of cyclohexanol selectivity to zero conversion gives a value of about 18% (Fig. 1b), suggesting that a fraction of it is a primary product formed directly from phenol. As already outlined by Smith and Stump, cyclohexenols are intermediates. Statistically, there is 1/3 chance that an enol is formed that can tautomerize. However, the OH-bearing carbon is generally hydrogenated last [72] thus enhancing the chance of breakage of the OH bond and ketone formation and reducing the chance of cyclohexanol formation. Moreover, DFT results suggest that differences in thermodynamics between cyclohexanone desorption and cyclohexanol formation are minute, whereas the barriers favor desorption of cyclohexanone [72] which is the predominant early product here. It has also been proposed that surface phenoxy species lead to cyclohexanone, and phenol leads to cyclohexanol, whereby on platinum adding one hydrogen to phenol is favored over OH dissociation, which should lead to cyclohexanol [70]. The slight increase in cyclohexanol selectivity to about 30% with increasing phenol conversion (Fig. 1b) can be explained by a fraction of sites that are not blocked by phenol and are able to convert cyclohexanone; since the cyclohexanone concentration increases with time, the contribution of this pathway to cyclohexanol formation and the cyclohexanol selectivity increase. In conclusion, phenol binds strongly with a preferred adsorption geometry of parallel orientation that requires flat ensembles of atoms, whereas cyclohexanone can also adsorb on platinum atoms with lower coordination numbers, such as edge and corner sites (Scheme 1 ). Platinum nanoparticles in supported catalysts are characterized by all three types of site, terrace, edge and corner sites. As a result, phenol and cyclohexanone can be hydrogenated at the same time on nanoparticles with site heterogeneity. The behavior of phenol is consistent with that of toluene and benzene, whose hydrogenation on platinum is known to be structure-sensitive [86]. Once phenol is consumed, the rate of cyclohexanol formation increases because additional sites (on terraces) become available (at about 160 min in Fig. 1a). This principal model of two types of sites was used to fit the data in Fig. 1 and similar data sets. Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics were assumed with the surface reaction as rate-determining step, as outlined in the supporting information. While good agreement between data and fit could always be accomplished, variations among data sets from different experiments were difficult to capture with a single set of parameters, and required adjusting, for example, the ratio of terrace sites (smooth surface) to edge and corner sites (corrugated surface). An additional complication in considering competitive adsorption was that DFT calculations give the number of surface atoms that form some sort of a bond with a molecule, and not the number of sites actually blocked or the packing density. Measured values for the space consumption were only available for flat orientation and suggest that phenol [74] blocks about 9 Pt atoms. It has also been reported that parallel adsorbed cyclohexanol blocks about 7 Pt atoms [62], while our calculations show an end-on configuration; hence an intermediate value of 3 blocked atoms was used. There were several robust outcomes of these fits (Figures S2-S6). While a strong correlation between adsorption and rate constants prohibited extraction of absolute values, the adsorption constant for phenol was significantly larger than those of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol for fits that describe phenol disappearance properly, consistent with the spread of adsorption energies. Cyclohexanol was found to always occupy sites rather than to desorb readily as the literature suggests [70]. The adsorption constant of cyclohexanol, presumably larger than that of methanol from the trends among aliphatic alcohols, was not large, thus indicating that smaller alcohols such as methanol themselves cannot act as poisons. A direct route from phenol to cyclohexanol was required to capture initial selectivity."
16,Alcohol reforming to CO and its competition with reactants for surface sites,"4.3 Alcohol reforming to CO and its competition with reactants for surface sites Methanol was found to be a strong inhibitor of the aromatic ring hydrogenation of phenol, benzene, and toluene (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). It was effective already in small concentrations, which excludes any classical solvent effects such as solubility of reactive species or stabilization of intermediates or transition states. Since the effect was not unique to phenol, reaction of the reactants with methanol can also be excluded as a cause for inhibition. The calculations (Table 3) demonstrate that while methanol and phenol may compete for sites, the interaction of methanol with the platinum surface is much weaker than that of phenol. Moreover, other aliphatic alcohols had similar effects, suggesting a common mechanism. The experiments with aliphatic alcohols, formic acid, CO itself and the direct IR spectroscopic evidence for CO formation all point towards CO as the poison. It is known that on the Pt (111) surface, adsorbed CH3OH dissociates to give adsorbed methoxy species at temperatures from 116 K to 140 K, which upon further heating decompose to CO and H2. At higher temperatures, the decomposition proceeds faster [87]. The adsorption of CO on noble metals has been extensively investigated. Sen and Vannice [88] performed calorimetric measurements on various platinum single crystals, platinum foils, and supported platinum catalysts. They found the initial heat of adsorption E0 (at coverage θ ≈ 0) of CO to be 206 kJ/mol, or 222 kJ/mol with Temkin’s approximations [33]. Yeo et al. [89], who also used a calorimetric method, found a similar value for E0 of 225 kJ/mol on Pt(100)-(1 × 1). The authors observed linearly decreasing values from 225 kJ/mol at θ ≈ 0 to 195 kJ/mol at θ = 0.5 and then to 80 kJ/mol at θ = 1 (E1 at θ ≈ 1) [34]. Values for CO adsorption on a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst are in good agreement with these findings: Dulaurent and Bianchi [84] reported E0 = 206 kJ/mol and E1 = 115 kJ/mol. Consistent with the strong interaction, CO desorbs from platinum only at 473 K [54]. Looking at the DFT results in Table 3, the binding energy of CO on platinum is comparable to that of phenol. Once CO is generated from dissociation of methanol on platinum, therefore, it remains on the surface under the experimental conditions reported in this work, regardless of the co-existence of phenol or other molecules in this system. However, it is generally recognized that CO can migrate on the platinum surface [90–92]. Our DFT calculations show that the diffusion barrier for CO on Pt (111) is as a low as 6 kJ/mol for the easiest path. At the typical temperature for our reactions, 353 K, CO surface migration should be facile."
17,Effect of alcohols on hydrogenation of phenol and cyclohexanone on Pt/C in aqueous phase,"4.4 Effect of alcohols on hydrogenation of phenol and cyclohexanone on Pt/C in aqueous phase The effect of alcohols, that is, carbon monoxide varies depending on the type of reactant. Various concentrations of methanol as co-solvent suppressed or even prevented the hydrogenation of phenol (Fig. 2). Since phenol was added last, the question arises whether phenol was not even able to adsorb, or whether the hydrogenation process was disturbed. Part of the answer comes from Fig. 8. Here, cyclohexanone was first added as a reactant and the concentration of methanol was high. Yet, addition of phenol had an effect on the catalytic process, demonstrating that the molecule adsorbed. The fact that hydrogenation of cyclohexanone was ongoing implies that H2 activation was still possible even at 20 wt.% methanol and according CO concentration and coverage. To explain why hydrogenation stopped entirely, the coadsorption of CO and phenol must block all sites, as also seen at the higher methanol concentration in Fig. 2. The distribution of CO on platinum varies with coverage [93,94]. At low CO coverage (and at low temperatures), CO molecules are preferentially chemisorbed on low-coordination surface sites, that is steps and edges. At high CO coverage, adsorbate-adsorbate interactions promote the formation of islands, and CO molecules are preferentially chemisorbed on flat planes of platinum, resulting in some depopulation of the low-coordination sites. It is not known how CO was distributed prior to phenol adsorption in Fig. 8, but the situation afterwards can be envisioned. While phenol cannot stimulate desorption of CO, it can supplant CO on terrace sites, which has to relocate to border and edge sites. A situation is then created where H2 activation is no longer possible and neither phenol nor cyclohexanone can be hydrogenated (Scheme 2 ). Benzene and toluene (Fig. 3), which are also known to adsorb parallel to the platinum surface [95,96], are affected in the same way as phenol. These results are consistent with a spectroscopic investigation by Chen et al. [97], who showed that benzene adsorbed on platinum could no longer be hydrogenated by adding H2 if significant amounts of CO were introduced prior to H2. The authors suggested three types of site, and different degrees of competition for these sites among benzene, CO and H2. While the presence of alcohols in water decelerated the hydrogenation of cyclohexanone, there was significant residual activity (Fig. 2b), even though the adsorption energy of CO is much larger than that of cyclohexanone. This behavior implies that the surface of platinum was only partly covered by CO and some sites were still available for cyclohexanone and hydrogen (Scheme 3 ). While both cyclohexanone and hydrogen can adsorb on platinum surface via one atom, they do not need specific sites on the platinum surface. The structure insensitivity is the reason for the residual cyclohexanone hydrogenation activity of platinum in the presence of methanol as co-solvent. At higher methanol concentrations of 80% CH3OH/H2O, the activity of platinum for cyclohexanone was extremely low (less than 5% conversion in 5 h). Under these conditions, the CO coverage is much higher, and, given that the adsorption energy of cyclohexanone is only slightly larger than that of methanol, competitive adsorption of methanol can further reduce the observed rate."
18,Effect of adding sequence and alcohol reactivity,"4.5 Effect of adding sequence and alcohol reactivity The effects of different alcohol concentrations, of primary vs. secondary alcohols, and of the adding sequence are explainable with CO formation rates and resulting coverages and distributions. Obviously, higher concentrations of alcohols accelerate catalyst poisoning (Fig. 2). Secondary alcohols afford a slow formation of CO, allowing phenol to be converted rapidly but slowing down the conversion of the formed cyclohexanone. If the catalyst is added last and not phenol, that is, if the surface can be covered with phenol before methanol can be reformed, then the poisoning is suppressed, too, and mainly affects the corner and edge sites at which cyclohexanone conversion occurs."
19,Implications of CO formation for use of noble metals to upgrade bio-oils,"4.6 Implications of CO formation for use of noble metals to upgrade bio-oils Catalyst deactivation during phenol conversion on dispersed noble metals has been ascribed to coking [98,99] sintering [100] or water-induced wrapping of the metal particles by oxide supports [101]. An exception is the work by Fujita et al. [102], who investigated hydrogenation of phenol on supported rhodium catalysts in the presence of compressed CO2. The authors confirmed that, during the hydrogenation reactions with rhodium, CO was formed from CO2 decomposition on rhodium and adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts, thus retarding hydrogenation of phenol and cyclohexanone. Here, a number of bio-oil components are identified as precursors of the poison CO. Alcohols are abundant in bio-oils, and the product (or intermediate in hydrodeoxygenation) cyclohexanol is also a secondary alcohol and could serve as precursor of CO. Formation of methanol from other molecules such as anisole or guaiacol is also possible, and deactivation has been observed with these reactants as well and ascribed to coking or sintering [12,98]. Methanol is a product of hydrogenation of methyl esters, and Pritchard et al. [103] ascribed deactivation of Pt and Pt-Re catalysts during methyl ester conversion to CO formation and poisoning of the platinum. Even more problematic is formic acid, which may be present in bio-oil at concentrations of ≈3 wt.%.4 The removal of these compounds by separation or selective conversion is difficult. By changing the adding sequence of catalyst and reactants, the Pt/C catalyst could be protected and was active for hydrogenation of phenol, but the following hydrogenation of cyclohexanone to cyclohexanol was still slow in the presence of alcohol (as shown in Fig. 7). Other strategies, such as choosing other catalysts or temperatures that will stimulate CO desorption need to be considered in future investigations."
20,Conclusion,"Pt/C is a highly active catalyst for the aqueous-phase hydrogenation of phenol at mild conditions and yields cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol as primary products. Methanol, which is abundant in bio-oils, can prohibit the hydrogenation of the aromatic ring in phenol (or benzene, toluene) on the Pt catalyst, since it decomposes to CO. Similar effects due to ethanol and 1-propanol were observed. Cyclohexanone conversion was less susceptible to poisoning than phenol conversion. The poisoning effect of alcohols could be avoided by mixing the components in specific orders. Considering information obtained from DFT calculations, the poisoning effect of alcohols on different hydrogenation reactions on Pt/C can be ascribed to the different site preferences and competitive adsorption of phenol, cyclohexanone, hydrogen, and CO. The findings imply that not only alcohols themselves in bio-oils but also molecules that produce alcohols during upgrading, such as phenolics with methoxy groups, can cause deactivation of noble metal catalysts."
