0,Introduction,"Glycerol accumulates as a by-product of the production of biodiesel and soap during the transesterification or saponification of triacylglycerols. The rapidly increasing volumes stimulated attempts to biologically or chemically convert glycerol to propanediols, hydrogen, dihydroxyacetone, succinic acid or macromolecules (http://www.york.ac.uk/res/sustoil/). Glycerol would also present an abundant substrate for production of hydrogen peroxide, an environmentally favourable and potent oxidant, using a glycerol oxidase. The second product of the reaction, glyceraldehyde, is a multifunctional chiral building block and precursor of mono- and diterpenes in biosystems operating the non-mevalonate pathway. Wood degrading white-rot basidiomycetes, such as Phanerochaete chrysosporium, form a wide array of redox enzymes depending on or producing H2O2 [1–6]. This set of enzymes includes alcohol oxidases (AOX), which catalyze the reaction of alcohols to the corresponding aldehyde and hydrogen peroxide. Peroxidases in turn, representing another part of the interlinked enzyme network, consume hydrogen peroxide as a co-substrate to attack lignin. Among the few oxidases of industrial importance is glucose oxidase, which is not only useful to produce hydrogen peroxide, but also to remove glucose or oxygen, thus acting as an inhibitor of non-enzymatic browning and as an antioxidant in food processing [7]. A number of AOX are known from basidiomycetes, for example from Pleurotaceae [3,4,6] such as Pleurotus sajor-caju [1] and Pleurotus eryngii [8], but also from Bjerkandera adusta [5], Gloeophyllum trabeum [9], P. chrysosporium [2,10,11], and from ascomycetes, such as Penicillium purpurescens [12]. All of these AOX oxidized common alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, and 1-propanol, and often also lignin-related aryl-alcohols, such as veratryl-alcohol, but no glycerol. A first glycerol oxidase was isolated from the ascomycete Aspergillus japonicus and thoroughly investigated [13–15]. Glycerol oxidases from Penicillium sp. [16] and from Botrytis allii [17] were described. Glycerol oxidase activities were also supposed to exist in strains of Aspergillus, Neurospora and Penicillium when grown on glycerol as the sole carbon source [14]. No glycerol oxidases or AOX with a side activity for glycerol are known from basidiomycetes. This motivated the search for a basidiomycetous glycerol oxidase and resulted in the characterization of such an enzyme in the present work."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals The chemicals and consumables were purchased in the required purity from Sigma (Steinheim, Germany), Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), VWR (Hannover, Germany), Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland), and Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany)."
3,Cultivation of P. chrysosporium,"2.2 Cultivation of P. chrysosporium Before use all media and equipment were autoclaved. Stock cultures of P. chrysosporium (DSMZ 1547) were cultivated in petri dishes on standard agar plates (30.0gL−1 glucose monohydrate; 4.5gL−1 l -asparagine monohydrate; 1.5gL−1 KH2PO4; 0.5gL−1 MgSO4; 3.0gL−1 yeast extract; 15.0gL−1 agar agar; 1.0mLL−1 trace element solution containing 0.005gL−1 CuSO4·H2O, 0.08gL−1 FeCl3 ×6H2O, 0.09gL−1 ZnSO4 ×7H2O, 0.03gL−1 MnSO4 ×H2O, and 0.4gL−1 EDTA). The pH of the medium was adjusted to pH 6 with 1M NaOH before sterilization. A 1- cm2 piece was cut out of the stock culture and transferred in 125mL of SNL medium (same medium without agar agar) and homogenized using an Ultra-Turrax. After incubation at 24°C and 150rpm in an incubator for 6–10 days, 25mL of pre-culture were transferred in 225mL of lactate medium (10.0gL−1 sodium l -lactate; 4.5gL−1 l -asparagine monohydrate; 1.5gL−1 KH2PO4; 0.5gL−1 MgSO4; 3.0gL−1 yeast extract; 1.0mLL−1 trace element solution) and incubated at 24°C. After 16 days of cultivation, the culture was filtrated and the biomass was washed with Tris–HCl buffer, 20mM pH 7.0 and finally stored at −18°C."
4,Enzyme purification from P. chrysosporium,"2.3 Enzyme purification from P. chrysosporium 10g of biomass were homogenized with Tris–HCl 200mM pH 7.0 using a Precellys 24 bead mill (peqlab, Erlangen, Germany). After centrifugation for 5min at 16,000× g the supernatant was used for further purification. The solution was applied to a Superdex 75 column and elution was performed with Tris–HCl 200mM pH 7.0 at a flow rate of 0.5mLmin−1. Fractions of 0.5mL were collected and analyzed for activity."
5,Activity assay with aminoantipyrine,"2.4 Activity assay with aminoantipyrine The assay of Uwajima and Tereda [18] was used for the determination of H2O2. Using 4-aminoantipyrine, phenol and horseradish peroxidase, H2O2 reacts to a pink quinoid product that is measured at 500nm The assay was carried out with Tris–HCl 200mM, pH 7.0. Blinds were carried out (1) without enzyme sample, (2) without glycerol and (3) by inactivating the enzyme sample for 10min at 95°C. Formation of product was followed using a microplate reader. One unit of enzyme activity was calculated as the amount of enzyme required to produce 1μM H2O2, respectively, at 30°C per minute."
6,Temperature and pH optima,"2.5 Temperature and pH optima For determination of the pH-optimum an assay using ABTS 2,2′-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt was performed at pH 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0 and 10.0 using Tris base and piperazine buffer, respectively. The assay was performed at 30°C in 96 well plates for a high sample throughput. Following approach was used for the ABTS assay: 150μL buffer 400mM, 75μL sample, 30μL glycerol 100mM, 30μL HRP 100UmL−1 and 15μL ABTS were mixed. The increase of extinction was observed at 420nm for 20min. Each sample was measured in triplicates. To determine the temperature optimum of the alcohol oxidase the ABTS assay was exercised at 30, 37, 42 and 50°C."
7,ESI-Tandem MS analysis of tryptic peptides,"2.6 ESI-Tandem MS analysis of tryptic peptides The enzyme band was excised from SDS polyacrylamide gels, dried, and digested with trypsin. The resulting peptides were extracted and purified according to standard protocols. An Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a nanospray ion source and gold-coated capillaries was used for electrospray ionization (ESI) MS of peptides. For collision-induced dissociation experiments, multiple charged parent ions of interest were selectively retained in the linear ion trap, then transferred to the external collision cell and the obtained fragment ions detected in the Orbitrap analyzer. MS3 spectra of selected fragments were recorded to obtain complete sequence information if necessary. From these spectra, the amino acid sequences were manually deduced and used for cross-species protein identification in public protein primary sequence databases."
8,Native gradient and denaturing SDS-PAGE,"2.7 Native gradient and denaturing SDS-PAGE For Native gradient PAGE self-casted 1mm thick polyacrylamide single gradient gels with a concentration of 3–12% were used for the gel electrophoresis. 20μL of enzyme samples were mixed with 10μL of the native loading buffer (0.05M Tris–HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromophenol blue) and were separated at 4°C and 10mA per gel in a Laemmli buffer system. For estimation of the size the All Blue Precision Plus pre-stained protein marker (Biorad, Germany) was used. After the electrophoresis an activity overlay was prepared by mixing 7.5mL Tris–HCl 400mM, pH 7.0, 1.5mL glycerol (50% (v/v)), 1.5mL aminoantipyrine 4mM, 1.5mL phenol 70mM, 1.5mL HRP 15UmL−1 and 225mg agarose. The hand-hot agarose gel matrix was casted onto the Native gel and enzyme activity appeared after incubation at 37°C as pink bands. For denaturing SDS-PAGE samples were prepared by mixing 2:1 (v/v) with loading buffer (0.1M Tris–HCl (pH 6.8), 0.2M DTT, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.2% bromophenol blue) and boiling for 15min. After electrophoresis at 20mA per gel, the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue."
9,Isoelectric focusing,"2.8 Isoelectric focusing IEF agarose gel electrophoresis was performed on a Multiphor II system (Pharmacia LKB, Sweden). Gels of Biozym® pH 3–10 and a protein standard of Servalyt precotes® (pI 3–10) were used for the estimation of the isoelectric point. The gels are suitable for proteins larger than 200kDa. 5μL of sample and standard, respectively, were applied on the gel. Electrophoresis was performed at 3W, 1500V, 12.5mA for 5h. Afterwards the gel was activity stained with an overlay of aminoantipyrine and phenol. Protein bands were stained with Coomassie R."
10,Protein content,2.9 Protein content The protein content was estimated by measuring the absorbance at 750nm using Lowry method [19].
11,Stereochemistry of the glyceraldehyde product,"2.10 Stereochemistry of the glyceraldehyde product To verify glyceraldehyde as a product of the reaction, a stereoselective aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) from baker's yeast (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used in a spectrophotometric assay. ALDH oxidizes d -glyceraldehyde to glyceric acid in the presence of NAD+. The reaction mixture consisted of 30μL NAD+ (3.5mM), 30μL glycerol (200mM), 1.5U ALDH, and 50μL glycerol oxidase sample ad 300μL Tris–HCl buffer (100mM, pH 9). Several blanks (sample+ d / l -glyceraldehyde, ALDH+glycerol, sample+glycerol without NAD+, ALDH+ d / l -glyceraldehyde without NAD+) and a positive control ( d / l -glyceraldehyde+ALDH) were prepared, and the rates of reduction of NAD+ were monitored at 340nm and 30°C using a microplate reader."
12,First-strand cDNA-synthesis,"2.11 First-strand cDNA-synthesis RNA was prepared from 500mg mycelium stored in RNALater® (Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany) using the NucleoSpin®RNA Plant Kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). Five micrograms total RNA were mixed with 25pmol 3′ Primer (5′-ATTCTAGAGGCCGAGGCGGCCGACATG 30*T VN-3′) and filled up to 10μL with H2O. The mixture was incubated at 70°C for 10min and then chilled on ice for 2min. 4μL 5× reaction buffer, 2μL dNTP mix (10mM each), 1μL RiboLock™, 1μL MnCl2 (160mM) and 200U RevertAid™ H Minus M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase were added, mixed and incubated at 42°C for 60min and at 50°C for 10min. Termination was carried out by heating at 70°C for 5min. Enzymes and reagents were purchased from Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany; oligonucleotides were synthesized by Eurofins MWG Operon, Ebersberg, Germany."
13,Sequence fishing,"2.12 Sequence fishing Primers were deduced from the published genome of P. chrysosporium: start_Pch 5′-ATGGGTCACCCCGAGGAG-3′ and stop_Pch 5′-TTACCGGACCTGCTGGGTAG-3′. PCRs were performed by mixing 2μL High Fidelity buffer 10×, 0.4μL dNTP mix (2.5mM each), 25pmol forward primer, 25pmol reverse primer, five U High Fidelity Enzyme Mix (Fermentas), 1μL first-strand cDNA and ddH2O to 20μL at an annealing temperature of 56°C and an elongation step of 2.5min at 72°C (30 cycles). PCRs were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis [1% agarose (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) cooked in TAE-buffer (40mM Tris–HCl, 20mM acetic acid, 1mM EDTA pH 8)]. For detection of DNA, 0.05‰ SYBRSafe™ (Invitrogen) was added to the solution after it cooled down to about 50°C. DNA extraction from agarose gels was carried out with the NucleoSpin Extract II Kit (Macherey-Nagel). DNA fragments were ligated into the pGEM®T-Vector (Promega). 7μL of insert, 1μL of vector, 5U T4 DNA Ligase and 1μL of T4 DNA Ligase buffer 10x were mixed and incubated for 16h at 14°C. For transformation 5μL ligation reaction were added to 50μL chemically competent E. coli TOP10 (Invitrogen), incubated on ice for 20min, heat shocked at 37°C for 5min and transferred on ice immediately. 250μL of warm SOC medium (Invitrogen) was added. The cells were incubated at 37°C for 30–60min at 225rpm. 50μL of the cells were spread out on LB-agar containing 50μgmL−1 ampicillin and 20μgmL−1 X-Gal. The plates were incubated for 16h at 37°C. Selection of positive clones was performed by colony PCR. The reaction mixture was composed as stated above but primers M13 uni (-21) (5′-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′) and M13 rev (-29) (5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACC-3′) were used. Template was added by resuspending white colony material in the reaction mixture which was then incubated at 95°C for 10min, followed by 35 cycles at 94°C for 1min, 55°C for 1min and 72°C for 2.5min. Final elongation was performed at 72°C for 10min. Plasmid DNA was isolated with the NucleoSpin Plasmid DNA Kit (Macherey-Nagel). Sequencing was performed by Eurofins MWG Operon (Ebersberg, Germany). To verify the sequence, genomic DNA was prepared from mycelium by using the Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Fermentas). The complete AOX sequence was amplified, cloned and sequenced."
14,Results and discussion,
15,Production and purification of AOX,"3.1 Production and purification of AOX During a screening of 36 basidiomycetes P. chrysosporium (Pch) was found to produce a glycerol oxidase activity. The enzyme activity was detected only after Pch was grown in a medium with 10gL−1 sodium l -lactate. In previous cases glycerol [14] or glucose [10] were used as the carbon source. Unexpectedly, neither glycerol, nor glucose or alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol or 1-propanol acted as inducers for the AOX of Pch. The enzyme activity was measured after cell disruption using a bead mill. The activity was first detected on the 15th day of cultivation and was stable until the 30th day of cultivation. The culture was harvested, and biomass was separated from the supernatant by filtration. After removing the remainder of the medium by washing with buffer, the biomass was used for enzyme purification. AOXs of several fungi were isolated by various methods. In the case of intracellular enzymes, mycelium extract was prepared by mechanical disruption [10–14]. The mycelium extract was pre-purified by (NH4)2SO4 fractionation followed by chromatographic steps, such as IEX and SEC [1,4,6,10,11,14,16,20]. In the present study AOX from Pch was purified after cell disruption using size exclusion chromatography which removed 95% of unwanted proteins; the final activity detected was 17.5mUmg−1 protein. Every effort to further purify the AOX of Pch using ultrafiltration, preparative IEF, ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, or polyamide column chromatography resulted in a rapid loss of activity."
16,Characterization of AOX,"3.2 Characterization of AOX The elucidation of the properties of the enzyme was carried out using the preparation from size exclusion chromatography (SEC). This resulted in a molecular mass of 130kDa. The mass of the protein was 75kDa (Fig. 1b) according to SDS-PAGE analysis suggesting that the native enzyme consisted of two subunits. Native PAGE with activity staining showed a 260kDa protein, but the comparison with denatured standard proteins is not reliable (Fig. 1a). Other fungal alcohol oxidases showed a larger size: that of P. purpurescens AIU 063 showed about 260kDa [12], whereas that of P. chrysosporium showed 440kDa [10], that of Paecilomyces variotii 450kDa [20] and that of Pichia pastoris about 675kDa [21]. All of them consisted of four to eight subunits of 66–80kDa. Thus, the subunit structure of the AOX of Pch is significantly simpler facilitating its industrial application. By means of electrospray ionization MS/MS, five tryptic peptides were sequenced ab initio from the protein band excised from the denaturing SDS-PAGE gel [VSNES(I/L)TTDDF(I/L)R, (I/L)SSNA(I/L)DAGFK, FYTDTMASSY(I/L)R, (I/L)AYADPT(I/L)K and AVGVAYVPSR]. Homology searches against public databases (NCBI Blast, programme blastp) showed highest homologies to AOXs of G. trabeum (ABI14440.1) and C. cinerea (XP_001838223.2). The peptides were aligned with the genome of Pch which is one of the few basidiomycete genomes publicly available. All translated peptides were localized in one gene. The putative AOX belonged to the class of glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) enzymes and has not been characterized yet. The aox1 gene coding the AOX was amplified using specific forward and reverse primers. Primers located at the ATG translation start and others ending with the stop codon were deduced. A fragment of 2439bp was amplified using genomic DNA, and one of 1956bp using cDNA to detect non-coding sequences. Comparing both, the genomic sequence of aox1 comprised nine introns which were localized at the following positions: 39–91, 170–224, 479–530, 693–744, 998–1057, 1228–1277, 1622–1675, 1806–1859 and 2226–2278. The ORF of aox1 corresponded to a protein of 651 amino acids (Fig. 2 ). No hypothetical signal sequence was identified at the N-terminus (SignalP 4.1) confirming the intracellular localization. The final sequence of the encoding gene was published at the European Nucleotide Archive under accession no. HG425201. It differed in some bases from the published genome sequence of P. chrysosporium (e_gwh2.7.116.1). Some non-coding regions were annotated as introns, and some nucleotides of the published cDNA sequence deviated from the experimentally confirmed sequence. The published amino acid sequence is seven amino acids shorter than found by this work and varies in 64 amino acids (90.4% identity, 3150 score). As the published sequences were generated by robots and annotated through computer algorithms, they result in postulated sequences only. The experimental data illustrate that some degree of uncertainty must be expected from automatically generated sequences, which in turn may explain the frequent laboratory failures in deducing specific primers from them. Biological variation among strains may add to the problem. Sequence alignment with alcohol oxidases from G. trabeum (ABI14440.1) and C. cinerea (XP_001838223.2) as well as with the annotated GMC oxidoreductase e_gwh2.7.116.1 from genome analysis of P. chrysosporium resulted in a maximum identity of 86% (Fig. 3 ). Furthermore, the partial sequence G-G-G-P-A-G within the N-terminus found in the translated structural gene (Fig. 3) matched the motif G-x-G-x-x-G characteristic for the FAD binding domain. Homology studies revealed that the FAD binding domain sequence of the AOX of Pch showed 100% identity within the reported alcohol oxidases of the basidiomycetes G. trabeum (ABI14440.1) and C. cinerea (XP_001838223.2), while only 67–83% identity was found for the sequences of Candida boidinii (Q00922), Talaromyces stipitatus (B8MSB1) and Aspergillus niger (A2R501). The isoelectric point was 5.4 (result not shown). Comparing the pI of other fungal AOX, which ranged between 5.3 [10] and 6.3 [21], the pI of the AOX from Pch agreed with literature. Only Aspergillus terreus MTCC 6324 produced an AOX with a higher pI of 8.3–8.5 [22]. The pH-optimum of the present AOX (pH 9, Fig. 4 ) agreed with the alkaline pH optimum of P. chrysosporium (6–10.5) [10], P. variotii [20] and G. trabeum (both pH 6–10) [9]. In addition, most fungal alcohol/glycerol oxidases described had a reaction optimum between pH 6.0 and 7.0 [11,16,21]. A further characteristic of the present AOX is the comparably high temperature optimum of 50°C (Fig. 4), whereas most AOXs showed maxima from 35 to 45°C [10,12]. Only few AOX are known with higher temperature optimum, such as the one of Aspergillus ochraceus AIU 031 with 55°C [23]. The ABTS assay was performed using various alcohol substrates. As shown in Table 1 , the AOX from P. chrysosporium showed a maximum activity for methanol, and 17% of this value for glycerol. K m and v max values were calculated using the Lineweaver–Burk-transformation of the Michaelis–Menten equation. A K m of 36.6mM and a v max of 175.4UL−1 were determined for methanol as substrate, and a K m of 1.9mM and a v max of 16.9UL−1 for glycerol. Most of the AOXs known mainly catalyzed the oxidation of methanol and ethanol; 1-propanol, 1-butanol and 1-pentanol were accepted as substrates as well [10,12,20]. Some AOXs tolerated even 2-bromethanol, 2-chlorethanol [24], 2-methoxyethanol, glycolaldehyde [12] or formaldehyde [12,20]. No AOX was reported to oxidize glycerol, not even with a low activity (relative activity<1%) [10,12]. Alcohol oxidases of G. trabeum, P. pastoris, and P. variotii exhibited K m values of 2.3, 1.4 and 1.9mM, respectively, for methanol as substrate [9,20,21]. A K m of 10.4mM for glycerol was found for a glycerol oxidase from A. japonicus [18]. The present AOX from P. chrysosporium is the first AOX accepting both, small monovalent alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, or 1-butanol, and glycerol as a substrate. Its affinity towards glycerol was ten times higher than the best data reported. The absolute configuration of the reaction product d -glyceraldehyde was assessed in a coupled two-enzyme assay based on a stereoselective aldehyde dehydrogenase as the second enzyme. Although this protocol does not completely rule out a parallel formation of the l -enantiomer, metabolic predominance and the stereoselectivity of enzymes suggest d -glyceraldehyde to be the main product."
17,Conclusions,"P. chrysosporium produced an alcohol oxidase which catalyzed the oxidation of glycerol to d -glyceraldehyde. Recombinant production of this AOX will be attempted to further characterize and apply the enzyme. The efficient oxidation of glycerol holds much promise for the technical production of both hydrogen peroxide and glyceraldehyde, and could contribute to improve the economics of biodiesel and soap production."
