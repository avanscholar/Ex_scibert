0,Introduction,"Heat-transfer liquids are indispensable for various sorts of mechanical and electronic devices to achieve the desired operating temperature, to transfer heat from one place to another, or to reduce the contact thermal resistance at the interfaces. Thermal conductivity is a primary parameter in designing an efficient heat-transfer liquid. In general, associated liquids having hydroxyl groups like water and alcohol possess a relatively high thermal conductivity among other liquids. This fact is intuitively natural from an empirical understanding that a stronger interaction transfers more heat. Sastri and Rao [30] reported that alcohol has a higher thermal conductivity than that of alkane by 10–20% when these are compared for the saturated liquid at the same reduced temperature T/T c =0.6, where T and T c are the absolute and the critical temperatures, respectively. This observation clearly demonstrates that the higher thermal conductivity of alcohol is due to the hydroxyl group or hydrogen bond. Understanding the microscopic mechanisms of how a hydroxyl OH can attain a high thermal conductivity therefore provides an important guideline for the molecular-level design of an efficient heat-transfer liquid. The present study thus focuses on the molecular mechanisms of heat conduction in liquids of linear alcohol. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation [2] is a suitable tool to this end. In particular, it is useful to decompose thermal conductivity or heat flux by different microscopic contributions, with the aid of either non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation or equilibrium MD with Green-Kubo formula [2,8]. With such methods, the molecular mechanisms of thermal conductivity were successfully investigated for water [24], polymers [19,25,33], or more complex materials such as a self-assembled monolayer on a solid substrate[17], lipid bilayer membrane [21], and nanocolloid [6]. As an extension of this decomposition techniques, we recently developed a new concept of the atomistic heat path (AHP) analysis [19] in order to understand macroscopic heat conduction on the basis of the molecular-level heat transfers. The core of this analysis is to consider each interatomic interaction as a path through which heat transfers, and express thermal conductivity as the multiplicity of the density of paths and the efficiency per single heat path. In our previous study [19], the AHP analysis was applied to liquid alkanes in order to investigate how different molecular structures display different thermal conductivity. Other authors also studied the relationship between thermal conductivity and structural properties or molecular interactions in long chain alkanes [4,5,33]. However, the electrostatic interaction, which is negligibly weak in the alkane liquids, was not explicitly considered. Also, there are only a few MD simulation studies on the liquid thermal conductivity of alcohol [10,26]. In these studies, only methanol or ethanol were dealt with and the molecular mechanisms of heat conduction were not of concern. In the present study, NEMD simulations were performed for the saturated liquids of seven linear alcohols from ethanol to tetracosanol at the same reduced temperature of 0.7T c. The simulation data were then analyzed by the AHP analysis in order to examine the molecular mechanisms of macroscopic heat conduction in these alcohols. In particular, we aimed to clarify the nature of molecular heat transfer by the Coulomb interaction in detail. In addition, the results on the alcohols were compared with those of the previous studies [19,25] on linear alkanes to extract the mechanisms for the enhancing effect of the hydroxyl OH on thermal conductivity."
1,Computational details,
2,Molecular model and MD algorithms,"2.1 Molecular model and MD algorithms The seven linear alcohols from ethanol to tetracosanol dealt with in the present study are listed in the first column of Table 1 . The molecules were modeled by the NERD force field for alcohol [15] with a slight modification as described below. This force field is a united atom model, where the C and H atoms in a hydrocarbon group (CH n ) are considered collectively as a single interaction site while the O and H atoms in the hydroxyl group are dealt with as explicit atoms. The O and hydroxyl H atoms and the CH2 group adjacent to O have a partial charge. The interaction sites interact with each other through the intermolecular van der Waals (vdW) interaction given by the Lennard-Jones (LJ) function, intermolecular Coulomb interaction, and the intramolecular interactions with bond stretching, angle bending, and torsion. Only the difference between the original model in Ref. [15] and that used in the present study was the spring constants, Kr and Kθ , for the CH x CH y bond stretching and CH x CH2 CH y angle bending potentials, respectively, in the alkyl chain part: i.e., we employed the value for NERD-alkane [22], (Kr/k B =96,500K/Å2 and Kθ /k B =62,500K/rad2) whereas in Ref. [15], Kr and Kθ were reparametrized for alcohol as Kr =2800kJ/mol/Å2 (Kr /k B ∼337,000K/Å2) and Kθ =760kJ/mol/rad2 (Kθ /k B ∼91,400K/rad2). Here k B is the Boltzmann constant. With this choice, the alkyl chain of alcohol is equivalent to the alkane in the previous studies [19,25]. This property is preferable in view of making a systematic comparison between alcohol and alkane to extract the pure effect of hydroxyl group. Methanol was not considered in the present study since Khare et al. concluded that methanol cannot be represented properly with the present parameter set of NERD force field [15]. As is mentioned in Section 2.2, our NEMD simulations were performed for the saturated liquids of alcohol at 0.7T c. It was not possible to examine the reproducibility of experimental thermal conductivity at these conditions by our model, because of the lack of experimental data. However, by another series of our NEMD simulations at 298.15K and 1atm, we confirmed that the present molecular model tends to underestimate the experimentally observed thermal conductivity by 24% on average (to be published elsewhere). The underestimation of this level is also expected for other molecular models based on the OPLS parameters for alcohol [13], since the OPLS parameters tend to underestimate the liquid density as pointed by Petravic [26]. Although this deviation might not be small, it was systematic and the present model successfully reproduced the experimental tendency of the chain-length dependence. A similar underestimation of thermal conductivity may exist in our results for the 0.7T c saturated liquid states. Other force fields with a better reproducibility of experimental thermal conductivity certainly exist. For example, the rigid, united-atom model developed by Guevara-Carrion et al. [10] was found to reproduce the experimental thermal conductivity of methanol and ethanol at near the normal condition within 5% deviation. However, this model cannot be applied for long chain alcohols since rigid models cannot be applied for long chain molecules where molecular deformation has a significant effect on thermal energy transfer [25]. In the present study where systematic comparison was made between alcohols and alkanes, we employed the present model because the present study put more emphasis on the elucidation of the influence of hydroxyl group on thermal conductivity, than on an exact reproduction of thermal conductivity. All the MD simulations were performed by using our in-house MD program that has been employed to study molecular heat transfer [16,17,19]. The reversible reference system propagator algorithms [32] was used for the numerical integration of the equation of motion with time steps of 1fs and 0.2fs for the inter- and intramolecular motions, respectively. The smoothed particle mesh Ewald (SPME) method [7] was used for the evaluation of the electrostatic interaction. These settings described here were common for the vapor–liquid equilibrium simulation and the NEMD heat conduction simulation, which will be explained in Sections 2.2 and 2.3, respectively."
3,Temperature and density conditions,"2.2 Temperature and density conditions In this subsection we describe the procedures by which we obtained the saturated liquid densities at 0.7T c necessary for the NEMD simulations. As in the previous studies for alkane [19,25] the temperature and density were obtained by performing equilibrium MD simulations of liquid–vapor coexistence systems. A liquid film was placed in a simulation box with constant number of molecules and constant volume with the 3-dimensional periodic boundary conditions (3-D PBCs). The system size for each alcohol is listed in Table 1. The cutoff radius of 25Å was used for the intermolecular LJ interactions. As was pointed out by Mecke et al. [20], such a long cutoff was required in order to count properly the attractive forces over the liquid–vapor interfaces. The liquid density ρ l and the vapor density ρ v at the vapor–liquid equilibrium were measured for four or five subcritical temperatures. The scaling law [22,28], ρ l ( T ) - ρ v ( T ) = A ( T c - T ) β with the exponent of β =0.32, and the law of rectilinear diameter [27], [ ρ l ( T ) + ρ v ( T ) ] / 2 = ρ c + B ( T c - T ) , were then utilized to obtain a continuous T–ρ saturation curve by fitting the parameters T c, ρ c, A and B to the measured densities ρ l and ρ v. Finally, T c and the saturated liquid density at 0.7T c were derived from the saturation curve as ρ l = ρ c + B(T c − T)+ A(T c − T)0.32/2. The values of T c and ρ c estimated from the simulations are listed in Table 1. These values of T c and ρ c are in good agreement with the experimental results within 5% deviations. An exception is T c of the ethanol, whose deviation was 7% from the experimental value. The deviations of 5% level is also seen between our results and the MD results by Khare et al. [15] with the original NERD force field for alcohol. This discrepancy mainly comes from different values of β in the scaling law rather than the minor modification of the intramolecular potential as described in Section 2.1 : they used β = 0.28 for ethanol and 0.29 for the others whereas we adopted β =0.32 because this value is the most common value for three dimensional fluids [28]. We found that with the same values of β, the discrepancy between their results and ours is reduced to be less than 2%. The obtained temperature and density of the saturated liquids at 0.7T c are listed in Table 2 ."
4,NEMD simulation,"2.3 NEMD simulation With the saturated liquid density at 0.7T c, the simulation box for the NEMD simulation of fixed number of molecules and fixed volume with the 3-D PBCs was constructed. The cutoff radius for the vdW interaction was 12.0Å. First, the system was brought to an equilibrium state at 0.7T c by a 2ns constant temperature (NVT) run with the velocity scaling followed by another 2ns constant energy (NVE) run. As depicted in Fig. 1 , this equilibrium state was then exposed to a constant heat flux of J ext =300MW/m2 in the z-direction by adding and subtracting thermal energy from the hot slab and cold slab, respectively, at a constant rate by velocity scaling under the total energy and translational momentum conservations [14]. Physical properties were derived from the data in the control volumes, which were located away by L from the hot and cold slabs in order to avoid any influence of the artificial injection and removal of thermal energy. The initial 5ns after imposing the heat flux was discarded as a relaxation run. The total length of production run after the relaxation run was τ run =60–130ns dependent on alcohol species. The specific settings of the NEMD simulation for each alcohol are listed in Table 2. The thermal conductivity λ was calculated from the temperature gradient in the z direction invoking the Fourier law: (1) J ext = - λ ∂ T / ∂ z , where J ext is the value of externally applied heat flux. The statistical error in λ was estimated by the standard deviation of 10 values calculated for subdivided time blocks, each with length τ run/10. Because of large computational cost, it was not possible to check the size dependence of our results by performing the NEMD simulations with different dimensions of MD box. Instead, we note the observation by Algaer and Müller-Plathe [1] that the effect of system size is not significant for a liquid system of several nanometers in length and several hundred to some thousand molecules."
5,Heat flux/thermal conductivity decomposition,"2.4 Heat flux/thermal conductivity decomposition The total internal heat flux J tot induced in the z direction by the external heat flux J ext can be decomposed into the partial heat fluxes, each of which accounts for the contribution from a specific type of microscopic energy transfer [19,31]. First, J tot is broken down into the transport term J trans and the interaction term J interact: (2) J tot = J trans + J interact . The transport term represents the energy transfer associated with the migration of atoms and is the sum of the kinetic and potential energy contributions, J kin and J pot, respectively: (3) J trans = 1 V CV ∑ s ∈ CV v s 2 2 m s v s , z + 1 V CV ∑ s ∈ CV U s v s , z = J kin + J pot , where V CV is the control volume, vs , ms , and Us are the velocity, mass, and potential energy of atom s, respectively, and the sum is taken for atoms within the control volume. The per-atom potential energy Us is the sum of all the n-body potentials of type X, U X , s ( n ) , which depends on n atoms s = {s 1,…, sn }: (4) U s = ∑ X 1 n ∑ s ∈ X U X , s ( n ) ( δ s 1 s + δ s 2 s + ⋯ + δ s n s ) , where δss ′ is the Kronecker delta. Note that the 1/n of U X , s ( n ) contributes equally to each of the atoms s 1⋯sn . The interaction term J interact accounts for the energy transfer by the interatomic forces. In liquids, this term is much more dominant than the transport term: e.g., J interact typically accounts for 75–85 % of the total heat flux in the saturated liquid of alkane at 0.7T c [19,25]. The interaction term is expressed as (5) J interact = 1 V CV ∑ X 1 n ∑ s ∈ X ∑ α = 1 n - 1 ∑ β = α + 1 n ( f X , s α , s · v s α - f X , s β , s · v s β ) ( z s α - z s β ) ∗ = J vin + J str + J ang + J tor + J vdW + J Cl , where f X , s , s = - ∇ s U X , s ( n ) is the n-body force of type X on atom s and (zs − zs′ )∗ is the portion of zs – zs′ involved in the control volume. In the present case, the interaction term is composed of six terms, J vin, J str, J ang, J tor, J vdW, and J Cl, which are the partial heat fluxes associated with the intramolecular vdW, bond stretching, angle bending, torsion, intermolecular vdW, and Coulomb interactions, respectively. The thermal conductivity can be decomposed in the same manner into the microscopic contributions as λ =Σ X λX , where λX is the partial thermal conductivity of type X, which is obtained by the Fourier law, (6) λ X = - J X / ( ∂ T / ∂ z ) , from the corresponding partial heat flux JX . Although it is also possible to decompose the potential term J pot in the transport term by different interaction types, we did not do so since J pot itself is a minor term and its decomposed compositions are quite small. The evaluation of the Coulomb component J Cl is not trivial because of the long range nature of Coulomb interaction. The per-atom Coulomb potential included in Us in Eq. (4) and J Cl are necessary to be evaluated inside the control volume. Since the control volume is of finite size, the Ewald sum [2], which is formulated for a periodic infinite volume, cannot be used as it is. Alternatively, in the present study, the modified Wolf method [9], an O(N) method based on the real space sum, was used to calculate the per-atom Coulomb potential. On the other hand, J Cl was indirectly calculated by subtracting the other terms from the external heat flux as (7) J Cl = J ext - ( J trans + J vin + J str + J ang + J tor + J vdW ) . Thus, in the calculation of heat flux, we avoided to use the Ewald sum. We note that the Coulomb force used for solving equations of motion was independently calculated with SPME as mentioned in Section 2.1, and the choice in the heat flux calculation does not affect the molecular dynamics."
6,Atomistic heat path analysis,"2.5 Atomistic heat path analysis In the AHP analysis [19], a single interatomic interaction is considered as an AHP, i.e., a path through which thermal energy is transferred. In general, an intermolecular interaction for a distant atom pair does not transfer net heat. Such interaction is not considered as an AHP. The partial thermal conductivity of type X is expressed by the multiplication of the path density ρ path X and the efficiency per one path, Λ X : (8) λ X = ρ path X Λ X . The path efficiency can be obtained from λX calculated by Eq. (6) and ρ path X estimated as described below. For the intramolecular AHPs (X =intramolecular vdW, stretching, angle, and torsion), the path density is simply given by the density of n-body pairs having the interaction of type X: (9) ρ path X = 1 V CV ∑ s ∈ X 1 , Regarding the vdW path, it is known [23] that the intermolecular vdW interaction does not substantially transfer heat beyond the first neighbor shell. An intermolecular vdW path is therefore defined as a vdW interaction inside the first neighbor shell. The density of the vdW path is given by (10) ρ path vdW, AB = n AB V CV 2 ∫ 0 η AB 4 π r 2 g AB ( r ) dr , for the intermolecular pair of atom kinds A and B. In Eq. (10), gAB is the radial distribution function (RDF), nAB is the total number of pair, i.e., nAB = nAnB if A ≠ B and nAB = nA (nA −1)/2 if A = B, and nA is the number of atoms of kind A in the control volume. The radius of the first neighbor shell, ηAB , is the position of the first minimum of gAB . The Coulomb path, the AHP of the Coulomb interaction, will be examined and defined in the present study in Section 3.3. The result is briefly summarized here. The Coulomb path is defined for the interaction between the pair of charge neutral group Q, rather than the atom pairs (see Fig. 8). Q is composed of the three charged atoms in the present case: i.e., hydroxyl H, O, and C next to O, and is positioned at the center of mass coordinate of these three atoms. The expression of the path density is analogous to Eq. (10) for the vdW path: (11) ρ path Cl = n QQ V CV 2 ∫ 0 η QQ 4 π r 2 g QQ ( r ) dr , except that the number of pair and the RDF are those for Q group. The neighbor shell radius, η QQ, is given by the position of the second or the first minimum of g QQ, depending on whether the first shell of g QQ is made by the hydrogen bond or not, respectively. In the present case, for example, η QQ is the position of the second minimum of g QQ for C2 to C10, where n as in C n denotes the number of carbon atoms in molecule for alkane and alcohol, since the first neighbor shells of g QQ of these alcohols were made by the hydrogen bond. In contrast, η QQ is that of the first minimum for longer alcohols since the hydrogen-bond shell was not well-defined for these alcohols. Thus, it is clear that the path densities in Eqs. (9)–(11) purely reflect the molecular structures in liquid."
7,Results and discussion,"Section 3 is organized as follows. First, we examine the results for thermal conductivity and the partial heat flux in Section 3.1. Next, the liquid structures, which are related to the intermolecular paths, are investigated in Section 3.2. In Section 3.3, the definition of the Coulomb path is given based on the nature of the Coulomb heat flux. Finally, in Section 3.4, the properties of the AHPs are examined to relate the microscopic heat transfer to the macroscopic thermal conductivity."
8,Thermal conductivity,"3.1 Thermal conductivity The NEMD results for the thermal conductivity of alcohol are plotted in Fig.2 (a) as well as the density and temperature conditions shown in Fig.2(b) and (c), respectively, while the numerical values are listed in Table 2. In each figure, the corresponding curve for linear alkane, taken from Refs. [25] and [19], is also included for comparison. The difference between the curves of alcohol and alkane at the same chain length represents the effect of the substitution of one of the terminal H atoms of alkane with a hydroxyl OH. The curve of alcohol correctly approaches toward that of alkane as the alkyl chain elongates and occupies a larger part of molecule. As can be seen in Fig.2(a), the alcohol thermal conductivity monotonically decreases with chain length. This trend is similar to that of alkane but the thermal conductivity of alcohol is systematically higher by 10–30% than that of alkane. This result clearly demonstrates that the OH substitution has an increasing effect on thermal conductivity. Fig.2(b) and (c) indicates that the OH substitution increases both the density and temperature of saturated liquid at 0.7T c. The higher density of alcohol is not surprising considering the strong attractive force by the Coulomb interaction. The higher temperature is then necessary to keep the same reduced temperature with the higher density. Fig. 3 compares the partial heat fluxes for various modes of molecular heat transfer between alcohol and alkane. It can be seen that the heat transfer by the vdW interaction (J vdW) in an alkane is partly replaced by those of the Coulomb interaction (J Cl) and intramolecular interactions (J str + J ang + J tor + J vin) in an alcohol of the same chain length. As the chain length increases, the main mode of heat transfer in the alcohol shifts from the intermolecular one to the intramolecular one, as is the case in alkane. In the case of alcohol, however, the decrease in the intermolecular heat transfer is mostly due to the decrease in J Cl, and J vdW only slightly decreases with the chain length. The decrease in J Cl with increasing chain length is not surprising since the hydroxyl group occupies only a tiny part of molecule in case of a long alcohol. In addition, the elongation of chain length increases the degrees of freedom of intramolecular motions, and therefore increases the intramolecular transfer as was studied previously [19]. Note that the contribution of J Cl is not very large and is smaller than that of J vdW even for ethanol. This result is counterintuitive because the Coulomb interaction, which comprises the major part of hydrogen bond, generally has a dominant influence on the physical properties of associated liquids. Actually, for ethanol, the Coulomb interaction prevails at least energetically: the Coulomb potential energy was −6.10kcal/mol while vdW one was –2.7kcal/mol. The result in Fig. 3 indicates that the Coulomb interaction is not always a prominent carrier of thermal energy although it certainly has an increasing effect on thermal conductivity."
9,Liquid structure,"3.2 Liquid structure In the AHP analysis, the atom–atom RDF plays a role in connecting the liquid structure to the molecular heat transfer by the intermolecular vdW interaction through Eq. (10). The RDFs for the intermolecular OH, OO, and OC pairs are plotted in Fig. 4(a)–(c), respectively, as representative examples. For all the alcohol species, the first peaks in the RDFs of OH and OO are found at 1.8–1.9Å and at 2.7–2.8Å, respectively, and these are well-known characteristics of the hydrogen bond in alcohol [11,13,29]. The second and farther peaks of the RDF attenuate with chain length. For hexadecanol and tetracosanol, the first minima, corresponding to the outer radii of the first neighbor shells, of g OO and g OC disappear, as can be seen in Fig.4 (b) and (c). It is, however, necessary to estimate these neighbor shell radii ηAB in order to calculate the number of the vdW paths. We found that for ⩽C10, η OO and η OC simply increase and decrease, respectively, with chain length as is shown in Fig. 5 (these subtle changes might not be visible in Fig.4(b) and (c)). On the basis of this observation, the missing η OO and η OC for hexadecanol and tetracosanol were estimated by extrapolating this chain-length dependence with a quadratic polynomial η OO(n C)=0.0016823n C 2 +0.034981n C +3.5322 for OO pair and η OC(n C)=−0.0012605n C 2 −0.012987n C +4.4388 for OC pair, where n C is the number of carbon atoms in molecule. The results are shown in Fig. 5. The number of hydrogen bonds was calculated with a geometric criterion [11,29] that a hydrogen bond is assumed to be formed between a molecular pair when the intermolecular OH and OO distances are less than the first neighbor shell radii, η OH and η OO, respectively, and ∠OOH<30°. The results for the hydrogen bond are summarized in Table 3 . In consistent with the previous simulation studies [11,13,29], ethanol has roughly two hydrogen bonds on average. For the longer alcohols, 〈n HB〉 decreases with chain length to 0.3 for tetracosanol. Interestingly, this decrease in 〈n HB〉 is mainly due to the decrease in the percentage of molecules with two hydrogen bonds."
10,Molecular heat transfer by Coulomb interaction,"3.3 Molecular heat transfer by Coulomb interaction The dependence of the Coulomb heat flux J Cl on the interatomic distance was examined in detail for the ethanol case in order to clarify the nature of heat transfer by the Coulomb interaction and to find an appropriate definition for the AHP of the Coulomb interaction. To this end, the average heat flux per single atom pair which has the interatomic distance of r, defined as (12) j X , AB ( r ) = 1 V CV f X , i , ij · ( v i + v j ) 2 ( z i - z j ) ∗ | r ij - r | ⩽ Δ r / 2 , i ∈ A , j ∈ B , was examined for each intermolecular atom pair of kinds A and B. For each r, the average is taken over the pair i–j whose interatomic distance rij satisfies |rij −r|⩽Δr/2. This is no more than JX in Eq. (5) but divided by the number of pairs and restricted to a specific kind of atom-pair and a specific range of interatomic distance. Here, the bin width Δr =0.05Å was used. In the calculation of the Coulomb component j Cl, AB , the Coulomb force was evaluated by the bare Coulomb potential 1/r with a cutoff distance of 12Å. In addition to j Cl, AB (r), the vdW component j vdW, AB (r) was also calculated for comparison. As representative examples, the profiles of the pair heat fluxes for the intermolecular HH, OH, and OO pairs are shown in Fig. 6 (a)–(c) together with the corresponding RDF, gAB (r). The sign of pair flux, with respect to the total heat flux, can be negative or positive depending on r. In the regions of negative sign, heat tends to flow in the opposite direction to the total heat flux. This phenomenon was already observed in the previous study [23] for a single component LJ fluid. The sign of pair heat flux reflects the sign of the corresponding interatomic force (see Supplementary data, section A). It seems that at large distance, |j Cl, AB (r)| and |j vdW, AB (r)| decrease approximately as r −3 and r −8, respectively. These exponents of decay rates are larger by one than those of the Coulomb and vdW forces, respectively. With these decay rates in mind, the convergence of the pair fluxes with r were examined by integrating jX , AB up to r as (13) J X , AB ( r ) = n AB V CV ∫ 0 r 4 π r 2 g AB ( r ′ ) j X , AB ( r ′ ) dr ′ , where the meaning of nAB is the same as that in Eq. (10). As the r −3 decay rate of |j Cl, AB (r)| indicates, this cumulative heat flux for each A−B pair does not converge at a reasonable distance (see Supplementary data, section B). However, the contributions from different kinds of pairs cancel out and a better convergence is obtained if the cumulative pair heat flux is summed up over all kinds of pairs as J X ,all ( r ) = ∑ A , B J X , AB ( r ) as shown in Fig. 7 . Note that JX ,all(∞) should be equal to the partial heat flux JX in Eqs. (5) and (7). The vdW component, J vdW,all(r), appropriately reaches its converged value J vdW =107MW/m2 within 4–6Å. Although J Cl,all(r) shows a better convergence than those of pair-by-pair cumulative heat fluxes, the value of J Cl,all(r)=47MW/m2 at r =12Å is only 72% of the Coulomb partial heat flux, J Cl =65MW/m2, evaluated by Eq. (7). The contribution from the longer r should account for the remaining 28%, but a huge computational cost prevented us from the investigation for longer r. However, the change of J Cl,all(r) is relatively small after r ∼7Å. For the Coulomb component, the portion of the hydrogen bond, J Cl,HB(r), i.e., the contribution from the intermolecular atom pairs in a hydrogen-bonded molecular pair, is also shown in Fig. 7. It is clear from the comparison between J Cl,all(r) and J Cl,HB(r) that the heat transfer by the Coulomb interaction for r <4Å is accomplished mostly by the hydrogen bond. The distinctive oscillation at r =2–4Å results from the fact that a large amount of the OH heat flux up to ∼2.5Å is cancelled by the HH and OO fluxes at a larger distance (see Fig. S1 in Supplementary data). The contribution of hydrogen bond, J Cl,HB(r), converged at r ∼5Å to 27MW/m2, which is 41% of J Cl =65MW/m2. This is a similar observation to that for water that the hydrogen-bonded molecules accounted for no more than half of the total heat transfer [24]. These results suggest that a non-negligible amount of heat is directly transferred beyond the hydrogen bond. Because of the slow convergence, it is not appropriate to consider the Coulomb path for each atom–atom pair. Instead, expecting a better convergence by the cancelations among the opposite signs of charges, we consider the Coulomb path based on a charge neutral group Q, composed of hydroxyl OH and the neighboring C atoms as depicted in Fig. 8 . The position of Q site was taken to be the center of mass of these constituent atoms. The cumulative pair heat flux J Cl,QQ(R), calculated for the Coulomb interaction between Q–Q pair for ethanol, is plotted as a function of Q–Q distance R in Fig. 9 together with the corresponding RDF, g QQ(R). As shown in the figure, J Cl,QQ(R) monotonically increases with R, i.e., the oscillatory structures in J Cl,all(r), including the large oscillation associated with the hydrogen bond, were averaged out in J Cl,QQ(R) as expected. Although the smoother curve thus can be obtained with J Cl,QQ(R), the discrepancy from J Cl still remains. (J Cl,QQ(R) must give the partial Coulomb flux J Cl =65MW/m2 for R →∞ since all the charged atoms are included in Q group. However, J Cl,QQ(R) was 45MW/m2 at R =12Å.) The most significant change in J Cl,QQ(R) occurs at around the first neighbor shell of g QQ(R), which is formed by hydrogen bond. Actually, as we discussed in relation to Fig. 7, a relatively large portion of the Coulomb pair heat flux goes beyond the hydrogen-bond shell. On the other hand, the distance dependence of J Cl,QQ(R) is relatively weak on the outside of the second neighbor shell radius, R =6.7Å. This shell radius for Q–Q pair roughly corresponds to the interatomic distance r =7Å beyond which the change in J Cl,all(r) in Fig. 7 becomes small. Considering these results, we defined the Coulomb path as the Coulomb interaction within the radius η QQ of the first non-hydrogen-bond shell, which is the second or the first neighbor shell of g QQ(R) depending on whether the first neighbor shell is made by the hydrogen bond or not, respectively. The remaining longer-range contribution from R > η QQ is equally partitioned into each Coulomb path defined for R ⩽ η QQ. That is, the efficiency is obtained as ΛCl = λ Cl/ρ Cl, where the partial conductivity λ Cl =−J Cl/(dT/ dz) contains the long-range contribution while ρ Cl is the density of paths only for R ⩽ η QQ. The Q–Q RDFs for all the alcohols are shown in Fig. 10 . As the chain length increases, the boundary between the hydrogen-bond shell and the next neighbor shell becomes less clear and for decanol or longer alcohols, the minimum at around 4Å disappears. For such case, η QQ is the radius of the first neighbor shell. The actual location of the shell radius for the Coulomb path, η QQ, for each alcohol is marked in Fig. 10."
11,Properties of atomistic heat path,"3.4 Properties of atomistic heat path The properties of the intramolecular paths for linear alcohol and linear alkane are compared in Fig. 11 . Since the profiles for the intramolecular stretching, angle, and torsion are similar [19], these are integrated in the figure as ρ path intra = ρ path str + ρ path bend + ρ path tor , Λ path intra = ( Λ path str + Λ path bend + Λ path tor ) / 3 , and λ path intra = λ path str + λ path bend + λ path tor , for the path density, path efficiency, and partial conductivity, respectively. The analysis of intramolecular vdW path is omitted since its partial heat flux is too small as can be seen in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig.11(a), each alcohol has more intramolecular paths than the alkane with the same chain length. This increased path of alcohol is a consequence of the higher mass density, as shown in Fig.2(b), associated with the increased number of intramolecular bonds per molecule and the attractive interaction by OH group. As was the case in linear alkane [19], the tendency of increased path density with chain length is due to the increase in the number of covalent bonds per molecule. As can be seen from Fig.11(b), the path efficiency of the alcohol shows a similar tendency to that of the alkane although the former is systematically higher than the latter. Both curves slowly increase with chain length. The intramolecular path characterizes the energy transfer inside a single molecule. It was shown that the thermal conductivity of a single chain molecule, such as polydimethylsiloxane [18] and polyethylene [12], increases with chain length if the molecule is kept straight in a vacuum. The linear part of the increase is explained by the ballistic phonon, which can travel from end to end of the chain without being scattered. In a liquid, the disordered molecular motion likely disrupts such ballistic modes, but a few surviving ballistic phonons may be the reason for the weakly increasing behavior of the efficiency in Fig.11(b). The path efficiency of propanol appears to be slightly higher in comparison to those of ethanol and butanol. The exact reason of this behavior is not clear but it is likely to be related to the fact that propanol has the most compact hydrogen bond (see Supplementary data, section C). From the results in Fig. 11, it is concluded that OH group has increasing effects on both the density and efficiency, and therefore on the partial conductivity of the intramolecular path, as can be seen in Fig.11(c). The properties for the intermolecular vdW paths for the alcohol and alkane are compared in Fig. 12 . In the calculation of these properties, the vdW paths to or from H atom were excluded since the heat transfer by the weak vdW interaction involving H is negligibly small (see Supplementary data, section B). As can be seen in Fig.12(a), the order of vdW path density was 10−1 Å−3, which is one order higher than that of the intramolecular path. As is the case in the intramolecular path, the path density for the alcohol tends to be higher than that for the alkane with the same chain length. The qualitative mechanism of this change in the vdW path density is suggested from the comparison between linear and branched alkanes [19]. That is, if there is sufficient space remaining to have more atoms in the first neighbor shell, the increase in liquid density by the attractive interaction or an additional atom in molecule results in more atoms in the shell and therefore increases the vdW path density. Conversely, if the first neighbor shell has no vacant space, the increased liquid density expels one or more molecules from the shell and the vdW path density decreases. The vdW path density of tetracosanol is lower than that of hexadecanol. A possible interpretation of this observation on the basis of the above mechanism is that the first neighbor shell in hexadecanol has few space for additional atoms because of its curled long chain, and a further addition of carbon atoms in molecule decreases the path density. As was the case in alkane [19], the path efficiency of the alcohol decreases rapidly with chain length. This efficiency reduction is known to occur because multiple vdW paths coming from different atoms in the same molecule interfere with each other and the number of the interfering vdW paths increases with chain length. Consequently, for octanol or longer alcohol, the efficiency of the vdW path is about one order of magnitude lower than that of the intramolecular path. Also, the efficiency of the vdW path for the alcohol is lower than that of the alkane as shown in Fig.12(b). This reduced efficiency for alcohol is explained again by the interfering vdW path since alcohol has a larger number of atoms in molecule by O, which means the larger number of interfering paths, than the alkane with the same chain length. It is clear that this reduction in efficiency is the main reason for the lower partial thermal conductivity for the alcohol in comparison with the alkane seen in Fig.12(c). As a whole, the differences between the profiles of the vdW paths for the alcohol and alkane are relatively small, which indicates that the OH group has a moderate effect on the heat transfer by the vdW interaction. The profiles of the intermolecular Coulomb path for the alcohol are plotted in Fig. 13 . The path density decreases with chain length as shown in Fig.13(a) simply because the concentration of OH group decreases. In the current definition based on the neutral group Q, the density of the Coulomb path has the order of 10−2 Å−3 or less, which is one or more orders smaller than that of the vdW path. It can be seen from Fig.13(b) that the Coulomb path has a high efficiency of the order of 10−30 Wm2/K, which is even higher than that of the intramolecular path. For ethanol, the efficiency of a hydrogen bond, i.e., the Coulomb path for hydrogen-bonded Q–Q pair, was calculated as ΛHB = λ HB/ρ HB =0.85×10−30 Wm2/K, where λ HB = λ Cl J HB,Cl(∞)/J Cl and ρ HB is the density of the hydrogen bond. In the non-bonded case, in contrast, the efficiency was ΛNHB =(λ Cl−λ HB)/(ρ Cl−ρ HB)=0.55×10−30 Wm2/K. Thus, the heat transfer by hydrogen bond is somewhat more efficient than that by the non-bonded Coulomb interaction. The chain-length dependence of the efficiency of the Coulomb path, i.e., the increased efficiency with increasing chain length, is also similar to that of the intramolecular path. As a whole, the nature of a single Coulomb path is closer to that of the intramolecular path than that of the vdW path. Associated with the decrease in the path density, the partial thermal conductivity decreases with chain length as can be seen in Fig.13(c). The results in Fig. 13 indicates that each Coulomb path is an efficient carrier of thermal energy. For monohydric linear alcohol, however, the Coulomb path has the lower partial thermal conductivity than the vdW path because of the insufficient number of paths. Thus, the Coulomb interaction cannot play the dominant role in transferring heat as shown in Fig. 3. On the basis of the results in this subsection, the behavior of the alcohol thermal conductivity in Fig.2(a) is summarized as follows. The decrease in thermal conductivity with chain length occurs because the two decreasing effects by the reductions in the vdW path efficiency and the Coulomb path density exceed the increasing effect of the increase in the intramolecular partial thermal conductivity. Substituting one of the terminal H atoms of a linear alkane with a hydroxyl OH causes an increase in mass density by the strong attractive interaction and an additional O atom in molecule. The increased mass density leads to increased densities of the vdW and the intramolecular paths while the increased polarity newly introduces the Coulomb paths. Consequently, the part of the heat transfer by the vdW interaction is replaced with more efficient transfers by the Coulomb and intramolecular interactions, since the vdW path loses its efficiency with increasing number of paths. Thus, the alcohol has the higher thermal conductivity than that of the alkane of the same chain length."
12,Conclusions,"With the aid of NEMD simulations, the molecular heat transfer in the liquids of liner alcohol was analyzed based on the concept of atomistic heat path. First, the distance dependence of heat transfer by the Coulomb interaction was investigated in unprecedented detail. The interatomic heat transfer by the Coulomb interaction was a long-ranged oscillating function of distance. Because of the cancelation of these oscillations among different atom pairs of different charge signs, a much smoother profile was found for the cumulative pair heat flux for the charge neutral group Q, J QQ. In particular, J QQ was only weakly dependent on distance outside the first non-hydrogen-bond shell. From these observations, we defined the Coulomb path as the Coulomb interaction within the shell. With this definition, the efficiency of the Coulomb path was about one order of magnitude higher than that of the vdW path and slightly increases with chain length. These natures are close to those of the intramolecular path. Second, the roles that hydroxyl group plays in heat conduction were extracted by comparing the results of linear alcohol and linear alkane. The microscopic mechanisms of why alcohol has a higher thermal conductivity than alkane were explained in terms of the AHPs. It was found that the Coulomb interaction is not always a dominant factor for the heat conduction in an associated liquid, where hydrogen bonds are formed. Actually, the vdW interaction, due to its huge number of AHPs, was found to transfer more heat than the Coulomb interaction. That is, at least for monohydric linear alcohol, the main role of hydroxyl group is not to be the dominant heat carrier, but to provide additional heat paths for all of the Coulomb, vdW, and intramolecular interactions. In addition, it was suggested that the heat transfer by the Coulomb interaction is achieved not only by the hydrogen bond but also the non-bonded Coulomb interactions have a non-negligible contribution. These insights obtained from the direct evaluation of molecular heat transfer provide a new perspective on thermal conduction in liquids and are helpful in designing efficient heat-transfer liquids."
