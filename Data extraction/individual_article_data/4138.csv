0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is an important chemical raw material for the chemical industry; it is mainly consumed for ammonia production, followed by refining and methanol production. Hydrogen is also a clean and sustainable energy source, which can be used as fuel for transportation and the power generation with fuel cells [1,2]. Currently, hydrogen is mainly produced by the catalytic steam reforming of natural gas, oil-derived naphtha, partial oxidation of heavy oils, coal gasification and so on [3–5]. However, the production of hydrogen from fossil fuels will increase the emission amounts of carbon dioxide and result in greater greenhouse effects. The use of biomass as a new feedstock for hydrogen production or energy source has attracted considerable attention in recent years [6–8], because it is an environmentally friendly and renewable rich source (the worldwide amount of biomass in 2006: 1.5×1011 tonnes [9]). Up to now, various technologies, e.g., catalytic pyrolysis of biomass [10,11], biomass gasification [12,13], steam reforming of bio-oil [14–17], and biochemical methods [18], have been explored to produce hydrogen. It is well known that bio-oil is mainly generated from biomass via a fast pyrolysis process [19,20], which generally contains numerous oxygenated organic compounds including acids, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, substituted phenolics and other complex oxygenates derived from biomass carbohydrates and lignin [21]. For the viewpoint of real application, the bio-oil has the advantages of collection, transportation and storage. Probably, it is easier to operate catalytic conversion of bio-oil in large scale. Thus, we are focusing on our target, which is the production of bio-oil by fast pyrolysis [22,23], and the catalytic conversion of bio-oil to hydrogen and clean liquid fuels (such as methanol, gasoline, and diesel oil, etc.). The most promising option to generate hydrogen from bio-oil is via catalytic steam reforming followed by a water gas-shift reaction, since these reaction steps give maximum hydrogen yield. The steam reforming of the bio-oil can be simplified as the catalytic steam reforming of the oxygenated organic compounds (C n H m O k ) by the following reaction: (1) C n H m O k + ( n − k ) H 2 O = n CO + n + m 2 − k H 2 The above reaction is followed by the water–gas shift reaction (WGS): (2) nCO+ nH2O= nCO2 + nH2 Therefore, the overall process can be represented as follows: (3) C n H m O k + ( 2 n − k ) H 2 O = n C O 2 + 2 n + m 2 − k H 2 An unwanted side effect of these reactions is the formation of carbon (coke) on the catalyst surface. Mechanisms of carbon formation as well as methods for its minimization have been proposed previously [24,25]. The most significant factor is the S/C ratio. It was also reported that carbon formation increased with unsaturation and molecular weight [24]. Two approaches were employed to decrease carbon deposits on the catalyst. The first one is based on enhancing steam adsorption on the catalyst with the objective of gasifying any carbon or carbon precursors formed on the catalyst surface. The second one aims at modifying the surface reactions via the presence of other metals. For the steam reforming of hydrocarbons, conventional steam reforming catalysts are 10–33wt% NiO on a mineral support (e.g., alumina, magnesia) [14,16], usually operating at T =830–850°C and S/C=2–6. For the catalytic steam reforming of the bio-oil or the model oxygenates (e.g., ethanol, acetic acid) [26–28], it has been widely explored via various catalysts, e.g., Ni-based catalysts [14,16,26], Mg-doped catalysts [16,30] and noble metal-loaded catalysts [24,31,32]. A lower steam-to-carbon ratio and a lower reforming temperature are essential from the viewpoint of economy. Noble metals (Pt, Ru, Rh) are more effective than the Ni-based catalysts and less carbon depositing. Such catalysts are not common in real applications because of their high cost. As mentioned above, another hindering for the catalytic reforming of bio-oil is the deactivation of catalysts due to coke or oligomer deposition even in the presence of an excess of steam (S/C>5) [24,25]. Thus, it is significant to prepare non-noble metal catalysts, which can be operated at lower temperatures and lower S/C ratios for the steam reforming of bio-oil. It is also important to develop a regeneration method for the deactivated catalysts. The microporous crystal of 12CaO·7Al2O3 (C12A7) [33–35] has a cubic structure, which contains two molecules per unit cell; it is characterized by a positive charged lattice framework [Ca24Al28O64]4+ including 12 subnanometer-sized cages with a free space of about 0.4nm in diameter. The two remaining O2− ions are clathrated in the cages. Recently, we confirmed that O2− is able to be substituted by other mono-charge anion X− (X− =O−, H−, OH−, etc.) to form the derivatives [Ca24Al28O64]4+·4(X−) (C12A7-X−) [29,33,36–39]. For the microporous material of C12A7-O−, the O− anions can be stored in the cages of C12A7-O− and can also be emitted into the gas-phase by applying an extraction field under suitable temperature [29,35,39]. Active O− is key intermediate in the anion chemistry, particularly in low-temperature oxidation/dissociation of hydrocarbons. For example, there are reports about methane coupling on the alkaline earth oxide surface, where the active oxygen species play a key role in the processes [40,41]. Because C12A7-O− has unique O− storage and emission behavior, this material may be used as a good catalyst to oxidize or decompose some chemicals. More recently, we found an approach of direct synthesis of phenol from benzene by using the microporous material [Ca24Al28O64]4+·4O− (C12A7-O−) as catalyst with oxygen and water [42]. In this work, we have investigated the C12A7-O−, C12A7-O−/M (M=non-noble metals), and M/γ-Al2O3 catalysts as the bio-oil steam reforming catalysts. The C12A7-O−/18% Mg catalyst has good performance for producing hydrogen from steam reforming of the bio-oil. The optimum steam reforming conditions, the catalyst characteristics and the mechanism of the bio-oil steam reforming as well as the deactivation and regeneration of the catalysts have been investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The C12A7-O− catalyst was prepared by a solid-state reaction at 1350°C for 16h. The more detailed process for the preparation can be found elsewhere [33,36–38]. The C12A7-O− pellet was also powdered and mechanically mixed with various contents of MgO. Finally, these mixtures were calcined in oxygen at 900°C for 4h. The final magnesium content in the Mg-doped C12A7-O− catalysts was measured by inductively coupled plasma and atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). These series of materials were defined as C12A7-O−/x% Mg (x: weight percentage of magnesium in the prepared samples). For preparing the other metal-doped (M=K, Ce) C12A7-O− catalysts, similarly, the C12A7-O− powder was firstly mixed with a given amount of KHCO3 or CeO2 and then calcined for 4h. The formed catalysts are abbreviated as C12A7-O−/x% M (M=K, Ce). To investigate the difference between the non-noble metal-doped C12A7-O− catalyst and the metal/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, we also prepared the γ-Al2O3/x%M catalysts via methods similar to those described above. Finally, all the materials were crushed into granules (60–80 mesh), which were then used as catalysts to investigate the steam reforming of bio-oil."
3,Catalyst characterizations,"2.2 Catalyst characterizations 2.2.1 ICP-AES The total doped metal contents in the C12A7-O−/x% M catalysts before and after the steam reforming experiments were estimated by inductively coupled plasma and atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) system (Atomscan Advantage of Thermo Jarrell Ash Corporation, USA). 2.2.2 XRD For studying the structure changes induced by adding metal oxides to C12A7-O− or by the reactions in the catalytic steam reforming procedures, we investigated the catalysts by XRD before and after the steam reforming experiments. The catalysts are generally crushed into powder with an average diameter of 20–30μm. X-ray diffraction patterns of the catalysts were recorded on an X’pert Pro Philips diffractrometer, using a Cu Kα radiation (λ =0.15418nm). The measurement conditions were in the 2θ ranges 10–80°, step counting time 5s, and step size 0.017° at 298K. 2.2.3 XPS To investigate the atomic states, their compositions on the catalyst surfaces and carbon depositing during the steam reforming of the bio-oil, we performed X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements on a VG ESCALAB MKII instrument, using Mg Ka primary radiation (15keV, 10mA). The normalized XPS intensities, which are proportional to the effective concentrations of the corresponding elements on the surface layer, were determined as the integrated peak areas divided by their corresponding sensitivity factors. 2.2.4 FT-IR FT-IR (Fourier transform infrared absorption) spectra were used to study the species absorbed on the catalyst surface; these were measured at 298K by a Bruker EQUINOX55 FT-IR spectrometer with KBr pellet method. The samples for FT-IR measurements were mixed at a weight ratio of sample: KBr=3: 100, then ground and pressed by a pressure of 400atm to a pellet with a diameter of 1.0cm and a thickness of 0.5mm. Then the infrared absorption spectra were recorded and analyzed. 2.2.5 TPO The amount of deposited carbon on each catalyst after the reaction was quantified and characterized by temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) in a stream of 10% O2/Ar from room temperature to 900°C; the amount of CO2 and CO formed was measured by quadrupole mass spectrometer (Balzers, GSD 300 OmniStar)."
4,Bio-oil,"2.3 Bio-oil Bio-oil used for the catalytic steam reforming was homemade in a circulating fluidized bed with a capacity of 120kg/h oil in our biomass clean energy laboratory. Bio-oil is a complex mixture including carboxylic acids, aldehydes, alcohols, lignin-derived aromatic phenolics, etc. Some properties of the crude pyrolysis bio-oil including density, heat value and pH value are listed in Table 1 . Table 2 shows the main elementary composition of the crude pyrolysis bio-oil and the composition of the bio-oil vapor (the volatile components of bio-oil). The oxygenated organic compounds in the crude bio-oil can be represented as a chemical formula of CH2.33O0.95·0.56H2O. The crude biomass pyrolysis oils contain substantial amounts of nonvolatile materials (35–40wt%.), such as sugars and oligomeric phenolics, etc., which are generally difficult to be reformed and can easily form carbon depositions, leading to the deactivation of catalyst. In this work, the volatile organic components of the crude biomass pyrolysis oils were used for the steam reforming experiments. The amount of the volatile components was about 60–65wt% of the crude oils. The oxygenated organic compound in the volatile components of bio-oil can be represented as a chemical formula of CH2.70O0.50·0.79H2O."
5,Apparatus and steam reforming tests,"2.4 Apparatus and steam reforming tests The bio-oil steam reforming experiments were carried out in a continuous flowing system using a fixed bed micro-reactor under atmospheric pressure (Fig. 1 ). The catalyst powder (typically, 200mg, 60–80 mesh) was adjusted to the middle zone of the furnace to get homogeneous temperature. The reaction system was equipped with pressure indicators and mass flow controllers. The bio-oil vapor was fed into the reactor using N2 as the carrier gas. Steam was used to adjust the S/C ratio (mol steam to mol carbon fed) in the reactor. N2 was ultra-high purity gas (99.999%). The products in gas were analyzed by two on-line gas chromatographs (GC1 and GC2) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). H2, CO and CH4 were detected by GC1 (Molecular Sieve 5A). CO2 and C2 hydrocarbons (e.g., C2H4 and C2H6, etc.) were detected by GC2 (GDX-502). The composition of the reactor effluent was also confirmed by a Q-MS mass spectrometer (Mode: GSD 300 Omnistar). The bio-oil reforming performance on a given catalyst was studied by measuring hydrogen yield, carbon conversion, products distribution and the catalyst lifetime under variable reforming conditions (i.e., temperature, S/C ratio, gas hourly space velocity, etc.). The hydrogen yield was calculated as a percentage of the stoichiometric potential, assuming complete conversion of carbon to CO2 according to reaction (3). Thus the potential yield of hydrogen is 2+ m/2n − k/n moles per mole of carbon in the feed. The carbon conversion was calculated by the total mol carbon in the gaseous products divided by the mol carbon in the fed bio-oil (i.e., the ratio of the mol carbon in gas to the carbon fed). The distribution of the main carbon-containing products (e.g., CO, CO2, CH4 and C2H4, etc.) is depicted as a ratio of the mol carbon in products to the mol carbon in the fed bio-oil. It should be pointed out that all data were almost constant for a short duration (depending on the reaction conditions), and then gradually deceased with increasing the reaction time due to the catalyst deactivation (see Fig. 8). For investigating the initial activity of various catalysts, all of the data presented were given as the average values, driven from the initial stable region. Generally, the experiments were repeated three times. The differences for various repeats, in general, ranged from zero to 10%."
6,Results,
7,Catalyst screening tests,"3.1 Catalyst screening tests 3.1.1 Comparison of different catalysts The prepared catalysts, C12A7-O−, C12A7-O−/x% Mg, C12A7-O−/x% K, C12A7-O−/x% Ce, and γ-Al2O3/x% Mg, were tested at a given molar steam-to-carbon ratio (S/C=4.0) and a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV=10,000h−1). Fig. 2a shows the hydrogen yield as a function of temperature. When the temperature was lower than 450°C, the H2 yields were low for all tested catalysts. With temperature increasing, the H2 yields increased in our investigated range (250–750°C). The C12A7-O−/x% Mg catalyst performed better (higher H2 yield) than the other tested ones. The H2 yield at 750°C was approximately 80% of the stoichiometric potential for C12A7-O−/18% Mg, which was about two times higher than that for γ-Al2O3/18% Mg. Fig. 2b presents the conversion of carbon in the bio-oil fraction to all gaseous carbon-containing compounds (i.e., CO2, CO, CH4, and C2H4, etc.). A significant increase in the conversion of carbon was also observed when the temperature rose from 450 to 750°C. The C12A7-O−/x% Mg catalyst shows the best catalytic steam reforming activity for all tested catalysts. Even though both C12A7-O− and MgO show some catalytic steam reforming activity, their H2 yields and carbon conversions are much lower than that of C12A7-O−/x% Mg. On the other hand, slight promoting effects of adding K and Ce to C12A7-O− on the H2 yield and the conversion of carbon were also observed. Thus, much attention in this work was paid to study the bio-oil conversion and the hydrogen production over C12A7-O−/x% Mg catalysts. 3.1.2 Effects of magnesium-loading content As shown in Fig. 3 (a) and (b), the yields of hydrogen and the carbon conversions were measured at different Mg-loading contents in the C12A7-O−/x% Mg (x =0–36) catalysts. It was found that addition of magnesium to the C12A7-O−-based catalysts significantly promoted the catalytic activity for the steam reforming of the bio-oil. As the Mg concentration of 18% in C12A7-O−/x% Mg was added, a maximum hydrogen yield of about 80% was reached and the carbon conversion was about 96% at the reforming temperature of 750°C, S/C=4.0, and GHSV=10,000h−1. Further increasing Mg concentration over 18% resulted in an obvious decrease of the hydrogen yield. On the other hand, the pure C12A7-O− and the MgO samples were also tested. Even though both MgO and C12A7-O− show some catalytic activity in the catalytic steam reforming of the bio-oil, the apparent hydrogen yield of C12A7-O−/18% Mg (the bulk density of the C12A7-18% Mg catalyst: 0.87gcm−3) is not a simple sum between those of MgO and C12A7-O−. Moreover, it was also noted that the hydrogen yields over the γ-Al2O3/x% Mg (x =12–18) catalysts were significantly lower than those of the C12A7-O−/x% Mg catalysts (Fig. 2). The above results suggest that the addition of magnesium plays a cooperative role in the hydrogen generation from the catalytic steam reforming of the bio-oil over the C12A7-O−/x% Mg catalysts."
8,Steam reforming of bio-oil over C12A7-O−/18% Mg catalyst,"3.2 Steam reforming of bio-oil over C12A7-O−/18% Mg catalyst 3.2.1 Effect of reforming temperature The important parameters for steam reforming are temperature (T), molar steam-to-carbon ratio (S/C) and space velocity (GHSV). Temperature is found to have the most profound effect on catalytic steam reforming reactions. The yield of hydrogen, the conversion of carbon and the distribution of the main gaseous carbon-containing products (e.g., CO2, CO, CH4, C2H4, etc.) were measured as a function of the steam reforming temperature ranging from 250 to 750°C at three different molar steam-to-carbon ratios (S/C=1.5, 4.0 and 9.0). Fig. 4 (a) shows the effect of temperature on the hydrogen yield for the typical catalytic steam reforming conditions at different S/C ratios (C12A7-O−/18% Mg: 200mg; S/C=1.5, 4.0, 9.0; GHSV=10,000h−1). The hydrogen yield is lower than 5% at the temperatures below 450°C. In the temperature range of 500–750°C, the hydrogen yield significantly increases with temperature increasing, and gives a maximum value of about 82% within our investigated region (S/C=9). On the other hand, water-rich mixtures (higher S/C) enhanced the H2 generation and improved carbon gasification (eliminated carbon-depositing) on catalyst surface. Fig. 4(b) presents the influence of temperature on the carbon conversion. It was observed that the carbon conversion also increased with temperature increasing at three tested S/C ratios (1.5, 4.0 and 9.0). Total carbon conversion was about 96% at 750°C for S/C=4.0 and 9.0. Higher S/C ratios favor the carbon conversion in the bio-oil. As the reforming temperature increased, both the H2 yield and the carbon conversion were controlled by the steam reforming reactions of the oxygenated organic compounds in the bio-oil (reaction (1)) and the reaction of water gas shift (WGS) (reaction (2)), which leads simultaneously to an increase in both H2 and CO2. In Fig. 5 (a–c), the distribution of the carbon-containing products (selectivities) is depicted as a function of reaction temperature for the catalytic steam reforming of the bio-oil on C12A7-O−/18% Mg (S/C=1.5, 4.0, 9.0; GHSV=10,000h−1). Our results show that CO2 is the major product together with small amounts of CO, CH4 and C2H4 in the effluent carbonaceous compounds. In order to more clearly show the selectivities of the products, the yield ratios of CO2/CO and H2/CO as a function of temperature are given in Fig. 6 (a) and (b). As can be seen, the CO2/CO ratio is very close to a constant value of about 1 at S/C=1.5 and a value much higher than 1 for higher S/C ratios (4.0 and 9.0). The yield ratio of H2/CO increases as the S/C ratio increases. In the temperature interval of 550–650°C, the H2/CO ratio sharply decreased as the temperature increased. However, both the H2/CO ratio and the CO2/CO ratio remained almost constant at higher steam reforming temperature (T >650°C). The above results indicated that the reaction of water gas shift (reaction (2)) was enhanced by increasing S/C, which mainly occurred at the temperature lower than 650°C. On the other hand, small amounts of methane and ethylene were detected in the products for the temperatures higher than 600°C. The hydrocarbons were most likely formed by the thermal cracking of oxygenated organic compounds, which always accompanies the catalytic reforming. 3.2.2 Effect of molar steam-to-carbon ratio and space velocity As already mentioned above, the S/C molar ratio (mol steam to mol carbon fed) plays an important role in the hydrogen yield and the products selectivity. Fig. 7 (a)–(c) show the yield of hydrogen, the carbon conversion and the distribution of the carbon-containing products as a function of S/C at a given temperature of 750°C over C12A7-O−/18% Mg catalyst. Both the hydrogen yield and the carbon conversion obviously increased with increasing S/C ratio from 1.5 to 4.0 and increased slightly from 4.0 to 9.0. Results also indicated that the selectivity to hydrogen and carbon dioxide increased by increasing the S/C molar ratio, while the selectivity to the other carbon-containing products (e.g., CO, CH4, C2H4) decreased. The most significant effect upon increasing water content is to increase the H2/CO molar ratio (i.e. the increase of the H2 production and the decrease of the CO production), as can be observed from Figs. 6 and 7. This result was not surprising because the equilibrium of the bio-oil steam reforming (reaction (1)) and the equilibrium of the water gas shift (reaction (2)) moved towards the CO2 formation with the consequent increase of H2 and the decrease of CO at the higher water concentration. In addition, the enhancement of the water (steam) adsorption on the catalyst surface favors the gasification of carbon-deposites, and thus improves the overall reforming process. Furthermore, no statistic influences of the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) on the hydrogen yield and the carbon conversion have been observed in the range from 4000h−1 to 20,000h−1. 3.2.3 Catalyst deactivation and regeneration The catalyst deactivation is a problem in the steam reforming of bio-oil process. The catalyst deactivation was investigated by measuring the yield of hydrogen, the carbon conversion and the distribution of the carbon-containing products as a function of the reaction time. Fig. 8 (a)–(c) show the typical curves measured at 750°C, S/C=4.0, and GHSV=10,000h−1. Initially, the yield of hydrogen and the carbon conversion increased for about 20min, as the reactants were fed to the reactor. The values remained constant following that, as shown in Fig. 8 (a) and (b). Then, a gradually decrease of the yield of hydrogen as well as the carbon conversion was observed, which was an indication of catalyst deactivation. The hydrogen yield gradually decreases from about 80 to 50% for the initial 3.5h (210min), and dropped to 21% for 5h. The carbon conversion in the steam reforming of bio-oil over C12A7-O−/18% Mg catalyst was high (80–95%) within the initial 2h (140min), but decreased to only 40% for 5h (310min (Fig. 8(b)). The yield decays of CO, CO2, CH4 and C2H4 were also observed (Fig. 8(c)). The inactivation of the catalysts occurring in the process of the bio-oil steam reforming may be attributed to several factors, including the deposition of carbon (coke-formation) and the structural changes of the catalyst and/or the content decreases of the active compositions in the catalyst. The XRD diffraction structure (i.e., the diffraction peaks of C12A7-O− and MgO) of the used C12A7-O−/18% Mg catalyst are similar to the fresh one. The diffraction peaks intensity of MgO, however, decreased after the steam reforming of bio-oil. Based on XPS and ICP-AES investigations (see Section 3.3), the decline of MgO diffraction peaks intensity after the bio-oil steam reforming could not be attributed to the concentration decrease of MgO in the used C12A7-O−/18% Mg. In other words, we considered that the catalyst deactivation in the steam reforming process was mainly caused by the deposition of carbon (coke-formation) on the catalyst. To estimate the deposition amount of carbon (coke-formation) on the surface formed in the bio-oil steam reforming processes, the temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) were measured under three different S/C ratios of 1.5, 4.0 and 9.0 at T =550°C, 650°C, and 750°C. The results are shown in Table 3 . With increasing of reaction temperature, the deposition amounts of carbon on the surface of the catalyst increased. The deposition amount of carbon decreased with the increasing S/C ratio as steam can improve the gasification of coke. Moreover, we cleaned the deactivated catalyst by ethanol several times to remove some compositions of bio-oil absorbed on the catalyst surface, and heated the material under oxygen atmosphere at 500°C for 4h to gasify the deposited carbon. It was found that most of the deposited carbon could be removed, resulting in the active recovering of the deactivated catalyst (Fig. 9 (a) and (b))."
9,Characterization,"3.3 Characterization 3.3.1 XRD Three different samples (i.e., C12A7-O−, C12A7-O−/18% Mg, and used C12A7-O−/18% Mg) were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD) to investigate the structure characteristics of C12A7-O−/18% Mg catalysts and their changes induced by the bio-oil steam reforming process. Fig. 10 (a) shows the XRD spectrum for the C12A7-O− sample, in which the peaks that are marked by “#” have been assigned to the lattice framework of C12A7 by comparing the peak positions and intensities of the XRD pattern with the data on the JCPDS cards. As compared with the C12A7-O− sample, new peaks (marked by *) appeared for the C12A7-O−/18% Mg sample (Fig. 10(b)), which correspond to the diffraction peaks of MgO. The positively charged lattice framework structure of C12A7-O− has not been destroyed after doping MgO to C12A7-O−. Fig. 10(c) showed the XRD spectrum for the used C12A7-O−/18% Mg sample by running the steam reforming of the bio-oil for 4h (the reforming condition: T =750°C, S/C=4.0, GHSV=10,000h−1). The XRD diffraction structures (i.e., the diffraction peaks of C12A7-O− and MgO) of C12A7-O−/18% Mg catalysts are similar before and after the steam reforming reaction. However, the intensity of diffraction peaks corresponding to MgO for the used one slightly decreased as comparing with those of the fresh C12A7-O−/18% Mg. These changes could be attributed to the decrease of the MgO crystal-phase in the used C12A7-O−/18% Mg after the steam reforming process, based on the results of XPS and ICP-AES. 3.3.2 XPS XPS measurements were employed to investigate the atomic states and their composition on the C12A7-O−/18% Mg sample surfaces before and after the reforming of the bio-oil. The atomic states and their surface mol concentrations for the fresh C12A7-O−/18% Mg and the used C12A7-O−/18% Mg samples are summarized in Table 4 . The content of the elements (i.e., Mg, Ca, Al and O) on the surface of C12A7-O−/18% Mg have no obvious decrease after the steam reforming reaction. The amount of carbon deposition on the surface was about 9.1mol% after the bio-oil steam reforming for 4h, which caused the deactivation of the catalyst. 3.3.3 ICP-AES The metal contents in the C12A7-O−/18% Mg catalysts were estimated by inductively coupled plasma and atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) system. Table 4 shows the atomic concentration of the bulk of C12A7-O−/18% Mg before and after the steam reforming experiments. No significant influence on the Mg, Ca and Al concentration by the steam reforming of bio-oil was observed under our tested experimental conditions. 3.3.4 FT-IR To investigate the intermediate species on the C12A7-O−/18% Mg surface formed during the process of the steam reforming of bio-oil, we employed the Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) measurements for the C12A7-O−/18% Mg sample before the steam reforming of the bio-oil and the C12A7-O−/18% Mg sample after the steam reforming of the bio-oil for 4h (the reforming condition: T =750°C, S/C=4.0, GHSV=10,000h−1). Fig. 11 (a) displays the FT-IR spectra of the C12A7-O−/18% Mg sample before the reforming of the bio-oil. The absorption envelopes in the 450–850cm−1 region are attributed to the C12A7 characteristic absorption structures, corresponding to the Al–O stretching and bending modes in tetrahedral AlO4 [43]. Even overlapping with a strong 3444cm−1 profile (the water absorption band of the KBr transparent disk), there is a distinguishable and repeatable peak near 3645cm−1 for the C12A7-O−/18% Mg sample after the reforming of the bio-oil (Fig. 11(b)). Because the 3645cm−1 band is close to the ν(O–H−) [44–46], it was assigned to the stretching vibration of O–H− on the sample surface. We found that the 3645cm−1 band only appeared for the reacted C12A7-O−/18% Mg samples. This would indicate that the OH− species adsorbed on the surface were produced by the reactions of some compositions of the bio-oil with the active O− on the C12A7-O−/18% Mg surface during the bio-oil steam reforming."
10,Discussion,"As the reaction temperature increased, it was found that the carbon conversion increased in the bio-oil reforming process. However, the H2/CO ratio decreased as the temperature increased over 550°C. Generally speaking, the chemical process includes the steam reforming reaction of oxygenated organic compounds with water (reaction (1)) and water gas shift reaction (reaction (2)) commonly occurring in the reformer. The reforming reaction is generally endothermic and is favored by high temperature, leading to a higher carbon conversion at higher temperature. In contrast, the water gas shift reaction is exothermic and favored by low temperature. If we only consider the steam reforming reaction (reaction (1)) and the WGS reaction (reaction (2)), the amount of H2 (in mol H2 per mol bio-oil) is calculated by the following relation: Y(H2)=1.85× Y (CO)+2.85× Y (CO2), where Y(CO) and Y(CO2) stand for the measured amount of CO (in mol CO per mol bio-oil) and CO2 (in mol CO2 per mol bio-oil), respectively. The calculated results are shown in Fig. 12 . It can be found that the calculated values of H2 approximately accord with the measured values of H2 under the reforming conditions of higher S/C ratio and lower temperature. However, with decreasing S/C ratio and/or increasing temperature, the calculated values are slightly smaller than the measured ones. The reason is not clear at present moment. The probable explanation may be due to more deposition of carbon (coke-formation) as well as dissociation of oxygenated organic compounds (C n H m O k ) at lower S/C ratio and higher temperature. It was also noticed that the active O− was able to be stored in the cages of C12A7-O−, migrated onto the surface and desorbed into the gas phase [29,35,39]. Active O− species has a high reactivity and is key intermediate in the anion chemistry, particularly in low temperature oxidation of hydrocarbons [47]. The active oxygen species of O− may be involved in the pyrolysis and the steam reforming of the bio-oil, because the intermediate of OH− has been observed by FT-IR. It was also observed that MgO was one of the most important constituents in the C12A7-O−/18% Mg catalysts, and significantly improved the hydrogen yield and the carbon conversion. Even though both the pure MgO and C12A7-O− show catalytic activity for the steam reforming of bio-oil, the overall hydrogen yield of C12A7-O−/18% Mg is not the simple sum of the yields of MgO and of C12A7-O−. Particularly, it was noted that the yield of hydrogen over the γ-Al2O3/Mg catalyst is much lower than that of the C12A7-O−/Mg catalyst (see Fig. 2). Thus, the addition of magnesium to C12A7-O− should play a cooperative role in the steam reforming of bio-oil over the C12A7-O−/18% Mg catalyst. It has been reported that the effects of magnesium on the Mg-doped catalysts enhanced adsorption capability and prevented catalyst sintering [48]. MgO, among various other reactive oxides, was generally chosen as a model oxide because of its particular simplicity, given the high ionicity and the simple rock salt structure [49,50]. The reason for the promotion effect of MgO during the steam reforming of bio-oil is not well understood at the moment, but the probable explanation involves enhancing the adsorption and dissociation of oxygenated organic compounds in the bio-oil. To make a clearer description for the steam reforming process of bio-oil, the catalytic studies on a series of model compounds are still required. Work towards this goal is in progress. Conventional steam reforming catalysts are 10–33wt% NiO on a mineral support [14,16] which operates at about 850°C and the reforming S/C ratio is usually 4–6. The conversion efficiency of bio-oil (the carbon conversion and the yield of hydrogen) by using the C12A7-O−/18% Mg catalyst is nearly identical to that by using the Ni-based catalysts, but the C12A7-O−/18% Mg catalysts possess some advantages including longer lifetime and lower steam reforming temperature. On the other hand, the inactivation is a problem for the steam reforming of bio-oil process. The carbon conversion to CO and CO2 decreased gradually with reaction time. The main impact on the decrease of H2 yield appeared to be linked to weaken both the steam reforming reaction (reaction (1)) and the water–gas shift reaction (reaction (2)). It was confirmed that the inactivation of the C12A7-O−/x% Mg catalyst was mainly caused by the deposition of carbon (coke-formation) in the catalytic steam reforming process of bio-oil. The following side reactions would produce carbon in the steam reforming process: (4) 2CO→C(s)+CO2(Boudouardcoking) (5) CO+H2 →C(s)+H2O(COreduction) The cracking of oxygenated organic compound to carbon is another side reaction. The deactivated catalyst can be efficiently regenerated by the developed treatment method mentioned in Section 3.2. A practical process for hydrogen production from bio-oil will, thus, require a reactor configuration that allows for the regeneration and reuse of the catalyst such as an alternating fluidized bed."
11,Conclusion,"The C12A7-O−/18% Mg catalyst shows higher activity for hydrogen generation from the catalytic steam reforming of the bio-oil, giving the highest yield of hydrogen among our tested C12A7-O−/M catalysts and other types of catalysts. The yield of hydrogen of 80% was obtained under the optimum steam reforming condition. The maximum carbon conversion is about 96%. It was also found that both the hydrogen yield and the carbon conversion over the C12A7-O−/x% Mg catalysts was sensitive to temperature, the S/C ratio, and the magnesium-doped content in the catalysts, but not sensitive to gas hourly space velocity in our investigated range. Based on the XRD, XPS, ICP-AES and FT-IR studies, we found that the active oxygen species and MgO were very important active components on the C12A7-O−/x% Mg catalysts for the bio-oil reforming process. The OH− species on the surface would be produced by the reactions of the bio-oil vapor with the active O−. The catalyst deactivation was mainly caused by the deposition of carbon in the reforming process, which can be efficiently recovered by the cleaning and the gasification of carbonaceous deposits. To make a clearer description for the bio-oil reforming process over the C12A7-O−/M catalysts, the further studies on the oxygenated organic model compounds such as methanol, ketone, acetic acid, phenol are still required."
