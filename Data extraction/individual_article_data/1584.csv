0,Introduction,"The conversion of biomass to produce value-added chemicals as well as bio-fuels can provide an alternative energy source to fossil fuels [1–3]. Furfural (FAL) is one of the major platform chemicals decomposed mainly from hemicellulose after the pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass [4–16]. FAL can be further upgraded by catalytic conversion reactions, including hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation [4–8]. The catalytic hydrogenation of FAL involving both CC and CO double bonds has been widely utilized as a probe reaction to evaluate the performance of catalysts, due to its distinct reaction pathways. Through decarbonylation, FAL is converted to furan (FN) and tetrahydrofuran (THF). When the aldehyde group is hydrogenated, furfuryl alcohol (FA) is firstly produced, after which tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) is obtained by additional hydrogenation of the furan ring. By the hydrogenolysis of FA, 2-methylfuran (MF) is also generated. Various noble metal catalysts, such as Pd, Pt, Ru, and their alloys with second transition metals, are utilized for FAL hydrogenation [4,5,12–16]. While noble metal catalysts exhibit high activity, non-noble-metal-based catalysts, such as Co, Cu, and Ni are developed to increase the activity and durability, due to their well-defined structures and high dispersion in supports [9–11]. Schüth’s group reported that Co3O4 supported on mesoporous carbon catalysts exhibited high catalytic performance in FAL hydrogenation [10]. A recent study showed that mesoporous CoO exhibited very high activity and distinct selectivity toward MF in FAL hydrogenation [11]. To create well-defined catalytic sites and promote high dispersion in the support, thermally reduced catalysts derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely utilized as efficient catalysts [17–24]. As a porous material, MOF consists of organic linkers and metal ions or clusters, which are arranged regularly to form a well-defined porous structure with a large surface area [25–33]. Thus, it is suitable for use as a heterogeneous catalyst but also plays parallel roles as both a template and a precursor to produce nanostructured materials such as metal nanoparticles, porous carbons, and their composites [34–40]. In particular, zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67), a sodalite-type MOF produced by the regular arrangement of Co2+ and 2-methylimidazole (2-MIM), is a good candidate for the production of Co-based catalysts [41–50]. The unit components of ZIF-67 are regularly arranged, and its isoreticular structure can provide the framework for the highly dispersed N-doped carbon-supported Co catalyst (Co/NC). When the original ZIF-67 is reduced by H2 at a high temperature, the Co ions in ZIF-67 are transformed into metallic Co, while the 2-MIM organic linkers become N-doped carbons. Recently, Gong et al. reported the application of ZIF-67-derived N-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) containing Co nanoparticles as a useful catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of biomass-derived compounds [51]. Although the catalytic activity in the hydrogenation of aldehyde, ketone, carboxyl, and nitro groups was meaningful due to the presence of Co nanoparticles confined with Nx species (Co–Nx), the overall morphology of ZIF-67 collapsed due to the high-temperature reduction (900 °C). It is expected that if the active Co species are uniformly distributed without aggregation in the porous carbon network, maintaining the original ZIF-67 structure with a large surface area, the catalytic performance will be further improved. Although many studies have been reported using ZIF-67 to use a Co/NC catalyst, few studies have observed changes in the catalyst to maximize the surface area while minimizing the size of Co nanoparticles during the high temperature reduction process in a systematic manner. To improve the dispersion of Co while maintaining the original morphology of ZIF-67, we prepared various ZIF-67-derived catalysts by H2 reduction at different temperatures and over different times. The structural evolution of ZIF-67 was monitored in real time by in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with a specific cell capable of characterizing the catalyst at high temperatures up to 1000 °C under an H2 atmosphere. Structural, chemical, and morphological characterizations were also performed to determine the most active Co/NC catalyst as a function of the reduction temperature and time. Through catalytic FAL hydrogenation, the correlation between the catalytic performance and the structure, porosity, and Co oxidation state of Co/NC catalysts were investigated. The ZIF-67-derived Co/NC catalysts promoted MF as the major product in the FAL hydrogenation (Scheme 1 ); however, upon the incorporation of Cu nanoparticles into the ZIF-67 network, the product selectivity was changed toward FA due to the preferential hydrogenation of the carbonyl group of FAL. This study provides insights into the optimal method for maintaining the structure of ZIF-67, which involves promoting the uniform dispersion of Co metals under various reduction conditions. In addition, the principle of varying the catalytic activity and selectivity in the biomass-upgrading process over MOF-derived catalysts is also investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation ZIF-67 was synthesized in an aqueous solution using a reported method with slight modification [52,53]. Briefly, 0.6 g of cobalt(Ⅱ) acetate tetrahydrate (Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O, 98%, Junsei) was dissolved in 5 mL of deionized (DI) water, while a solution containing 2.24 g of 2-MIM (C4H6N2, 97%, Alfa Aesar) in 5 mL of DI water was prepared separately. After sonication for complete dissolution, the two solutions were mixed with stirring, after which they were kept for 5 h without stirring at room temperature. The resulting purple precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed with ethanol. After drying at 50 °C for 24 h in an oven, the resulting powder was reduced by 4% H2/Ar at a heating rate of 100 °C h−1 at different temperatures and over different times. During the reduction, ZIF-67 was converted to Co/NC. The resulting Co/NC catalyst was denoted by Co/NC-R-T (where R and T represent the reduction temperature and time, respectively). After the reduction, all the catalysts were stored in a vacuum desiccator to prevent oxidation of the Co nanoparticles by air. Cu-incorporated ZIF-67 catalysts with different Cu loadings (x-Cu/ZIF) were prepared by metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) [54]. Briefly, copper(II) acetylacetonate, in the target concentration, was mixed with 0.2 g of ZIF-67 and heated to 180 °C at a rate of 2.7 °C min−1 under a N2 atmosphere. The mixture was kept at 180 °C for 1 h for the sublimation of the copper precursor to occur; thereafter, it was further heated to 350 °C (2 °C min−1) and held at this temperature for 1 h. The resulting x-Cu/ZIF product was washed with ethanol several times. No reduction was performed on the Cu/ZIF catalyst to avoid the formation of metallic Co from ZIF-67."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The structural characterization of ZIF-67 and its reduced products (catalysts) was carried out by Scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4800 microscope), TEM (JEOL, JEM-2100F) with Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, Oxford instrument, X-Max 80T), N2 physisorption by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET, BELSorp-max) method, and XRD (PANalytical X’Pert Pro) using a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 0.154056 nm). The surface chemical property was characterized using an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher system) equipped with an Al Kα radiation source. An in situ XRD (Rigaku) equipped with a D/teX Ultra 250 detector using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154056 nm) was used to collect diffraction data during the thermo-programmed reduction from 25 to 800 °C (heating rate of 5 °C min−1) under a flow of 4.0 vol% H2 in Ar (30 mL min−1) [11,12]. An in situ TEM study was carried out using a micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) device-based heating holder cell (Climate S3+, Dens solutions) equipped an aberration-corrected scanning TEM (JEOL JEM-2100F) at 200 kV. The sample was deposited on a silicon nitride TEM membrane and assembled in a heating holder cell. The in situ microscope holder was inserted into the main body of the microscope and maintained under 1 bar of H2 by a flow of 5.0 vol% H2 in Ar (1 mL min−1). The local heating on the MEMS device cell was achieved by the Joule heating of a micro-patterned metal heater to control the temperature up to 600 °C. The analysis was carried out at different temperatures after maintaining these conditions for 30 min. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was carried out at the beamline 6D of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL, South Korea). An electron beam energy of 3.0 GeV and an incident X-ray current of 300 mA were achieved, and an Si(111) double-crystal monochromator was used to filter the incident photon energy. The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of the Co K-edge region were also collected in the transmission detection mode. The IFEFFIT (Athena) software was used to remove the background and normalize the XAS spectrum. For comparison, Co3O4 and CoO, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (99.99%), and metallic Co foil were used as the reference materials. The composition of metals in the catalyst was determined by inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry (ICP–OES, Varian, 700-ES). The concentration of Co (or Cu) was calibrated by a multi-standard solution (Inorganic ventures). The digestion of the catalyst was carried out by dissolving the catalyst in aqua regia for 3 days. The solution was diluted with DI water and filtered to remove a carbon support prior to measurement. CO-chemisorption was measured by BELCAT II (MicrotracBEL Corp.). Pretreatment of the catalyst was performed at 180 °C in 5% H2/He for 1 h. After the pretreatment, the temperature was lowered to the measurement temperature (−80 °C). The concentration of CO-pulse gas was 5% CO/He. A 30 sccm of the CO/He mixture was injected into the catalyst for 10 s in one pulse."
4,Catalytic activity evaluation,"2.3 Catalytic activity evaluation For the catalytic FAL hydrogenation, a 100 mL scaled stainless-steel batch reactor was used (Chemresys Co.). One gram of FAL (C5H4O2, 99%, Acros), dissolved in 20 mL of 2-propanol, (C3H8O, 99.5%, Alfa Aesar) was added to the reactor in the presence of the catalyst (10–20 mg) [11,12]. Before initiating the reaction, the solution was purged with H2. The initially set H2 gas pressure was 20 bar at room temperature. The reaction proceeded at 180 °C for 5 h with stirring at 600 rpm. A gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent 7820A) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) using a DB-WAX column (30 m × 0.320 mm × 0.25 µm) was used to identify and quantify the product. The conversion of FAL, the product selectivity, and the reaction rate were calculated using the following formulas: C o n v e r s i o n % = m o l F A L c o n s u m e d m o l FAL f e d × 100 S e l e c t i v i t y % = m o l p r o d u c t f o r m e d Σ m o l p r o d u c t s f o r m e d × 100 R e a c t i o n r a t e m i n - 1 = m o l F A L c o n v e r t e d mol ex p o s e d m e t a l s i t e s · t i m e The FAL conversion was calculated by the mole of FAL converted by the mole of FAL fed. The reaction rate was determined by the FAL conversion of less than 30–40% under the controlled reaction parameters, resulting in a kinetically-controlled regime. The amount of Co (or Cu) in the catalyst was determined by the ICP–OES results and the number of exposed metal sites of Co and Cu was calculated as a result of CO-chemisorption."
5,Results and discussion,"Supported metallic Co acts as an active species in many heterogeneous catalytic reactions rather than as Co complexes with high oxidation states [41–50]. Various supported Co catalysts are simply prepared by the reduction of Co precursors using H2. The H2 reduction of ZIF-67 yields a Co/NC catalyst, where the Co ions of ZIF-67 are reduced to metallic Co nanoparticles, and the 2-MIM organic linkers become N-doped carbon. The morphology of ZIF-67 derived catalysts varies depending on the reduction temperature . When the reduction of ZIF-67 was carried out at different temperatures, the change in the morphology became more pronounced. As the reduction temperature increased to 200, 400, 500, and 600 °C, the size of the Co nanoparticles increased. Beyond 400 °C, the original polyhedral ZIF-67 structure changed to a more irregular shape with Co nanoparticles larger than 50–100 nm (Fig. S1). The structural evolution of the ZIF-67-derived catalysts was further visualized by in situ TEM in an H2 environment. The snapshots of the ZIF-67 structural changes were obtained using an in situ gas cell, equipped with a spherical aberration coefficient-corrected TEM at 200 kV (Fig. 1 ). The ZIF-67 loaded in the gas cell was heated from room temperature to 600 °C with a flow of 5% H2/Ar, and there was no apparent change in the observed morphology of ZIF-67 up to 500 °C. However, at temperatures above 500 °C, the polyhedral form suffered severe shrinkage due to the Co clusters created in the ZIF-67 core. supplementary materialsThese results directly showed that the rapid decomposition of the ZIF-67 structure at high temperatures induces severe aggregation of the resultant nanoparticles. Thus, it was established that the optimum reduction temperature is 400 °C, where the ZIF-67 begins to collapse slowly while maintaining its original polyhedral shape. Fig. 2 shows the transformation of ZIF-67 to Co/NC-400-6 after H2 reduction at 400 °C for 6 h. The original ZIF-67 has a uniform polyhedral structure with a smooth surface, as evidenced by SEM (Fig. 2a). The average outer diameter of ZIF-67 was 501 nm. After reduction, the polyhedral ZIF-67, with a smooth surface, changes into a porous structure consisting of small clusters while retaining its original size. Fig. 2b shows that the overall morphology of the Co/NC-400-6 catalyst was preserved after the reduction. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms show that the original surface area of ZIF-67 (1458 m2 g−1) was significantly decreased to about 200 m2 g−1 after the reduction at 400 °C (Table S1 and Fig. S2). The surface areas of Co/NC-400-2 and Co/NC-400-8 were reduced to 219 and 202 m2 g−1, respectively. However, the surface area of Co/NC-400-12 was significantly reduced to 132 m2 g−1 due to the severe reducing environment. The Co weight percent (wt%), determined by ICP–OES, and the average Co particle size of the catalyst are provided in supplementary materials, Table S2 and Fig. S3. As the MOF structure was collapsed after the reduction, the relative concentration of Co was increased with the same amount of catalyst. ZIF-67 contains 28.0 wt% Co, however, the reduced Co/NC-400 catalyst contained 41–55 wt% Co. Scanning TEM (STEM) imaging and the corresponding elemental mappings with EDS results indicated that Co, C, and N derived from ZIF-67 were uniformly dispersed within the framework (Fig. 2b). When the reduction time at 400 °C was increased to 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 h, the changes in the ZIF-67 structure were clearly confirmed by TEM, as shown in Fig. 3 . The average particle size of Co was determined to be 3.4–5.0 nm for Co/NC-400-2, Co/NC-400-4, and Co/NC-400-6 catalysts (Fig. S3). However, the Co size of Co/NC-400-12 increased to 20.8 nm due to high temperature agglomeration (Fig. S3). Interestingly, the reduced Co species act as a catalyst for the growth of CNTs. After the reduction at 400 °C for 12 h, the production of CNTs was significantly enhanced due to the growth of Co-catalyzed carbon (Fig. 3e). The structural transformation of ZIF-67 into the Co/NC catalyst was monitored by in situ XRD under a 4% H2/Ar atmosphere (Fig. 4 a-b). The original ZIF-67 shows a representative XRD pattern due to its well-organized framework. As the temperature increases from 25 to 800 °C, the ZIF-67 structure begins to collapse above 400 °C. At the same time, a diffraction peak corresponding to Co(111) nanoparticle appears (Fig. 4a). When the H2 reduction was conducted at 400 °C, the Co(111) peak begins to appear noticeably over 4 h in the XRD pattern (Fig. 4b). As the reduction time further increases over 8 h, traces of the characteristic MOF pattern disappear, while the intensity of the Co(111) peak increases. The presence of the non-sharp and weakened XRD peaks reveals that the overall structure of ZIF-67 did not significantly collapse up to 6 h under the 400 °C reduction condition, which is consistent with the TEM results (Fig. 3, Fig. S4). The Co/NC catalysts obtained after the H2 reduction at 400 °C for different reduction times are characterized by XPSand XANES measurements to confirm the distribution of the Co oxidation states (Fig. 4c-d). After reduction, the metallic Co phase, which is invisible in the original ZIF-67 spectra, becomes noticeable for Co/NC-400-2, Co/NC-400-4, and Co/NC-400-6 in the XPS profiles (Fig. 4c). To investigate the change in Co metal content by increasing the reduction time, Co K-edge XANES spectra of Co/NC-400 catalysts were obtained (Fig. 4d). The Co K-edgeXANESspectra show the transition from Co 1s to Co 4p through a mixed state with O 2p, which is sensitive to the oxidation state of Co [11]. The degree of reduction of Co was determined by fitting the XANES spectra with the reference spectra obtained from commercial Co3O4 and Co0. The change of oxidation state from Co3O4 to Co0 is evidenced by the reduced white-line intensity (at 7730 eV based on Co3O4 reference) and increased pre-edge area (<7720 eV based on Co0 reference). The normalized XANES spectra of Co/NC-400-2, Co/NC-400-4, and Co/NC-400-6 show a clear tendency to increase the proportion of Co0 with increasing reduction time. As the reduction time increases, the trend of increasing Co0 content is the same as the trend of Co particle growth (Table S2). From these results, it was confirmed that ZIF-67 was converted to Co/NC without destroying its original morphology until 6 h after H2 reduction at 400 °C, and the obtained Co/NC product had a metallic Co phase. A liquid-phase FAL hydrogenation reaction was carried out over the ZIF-67-derived catalysts in a high-pressure autoclave reactor [11,12]. To investigate the catalytic activity and selectivity toward the FAL hydrogenation, 1 g of FAL, dissolved in 2-propanol with the catalyst, was pressurized with 20 bar of H2, followed by a reaction at 180 °C for 5 h. Under the current reaction conditions, FAL hydrogenation has two distinct reaction pathways: the hydrogenation of the aldehyde group and decarbonylation (Fig. 5 a). When the carbonyl group is removed from FAL, FN is produced. By subsequent hydrogenation, the produced FN is converted to THF. On the contrary, the aldehyde group of FAL is hydrogenated to produce FA, which is further converted to either THFA or MF. MF is produced by the hydrogenolysis of FA. In previous reports, Co-containing catalysts showed relatively high selectivity toward MF when there was sufficient conversion [11]. Fig. 5b and Table 1 summarize the FAL conversion and product selectivity over the Co/NC-400 catalysts derived by the H2 reduction of ZIF-67. The conversion was 11.9% in the absence of a catalyst under the reaction condition of 180 °C, 20 bar H2, and 5 h. In the absence of a catalyst, FAL can pyrolyze at 180 °C. When ZIF-67 (10 mg) was used as a catalyst, it showed similar conversion with the blank reaction (11.4%), but the selectivity was different. When the amount of ZIF-67 was further increased to 40 and 200 mg under the same reaction conditions, the activity did not change significantly (Table 1). It was found that the Co2+ species connected by organic linkers in the ZIF-67 structure exhibited negligible activity against FAL hydrogenation. Nevertheless, ZIF-67 acted as a catalyst, unlike catalystless pyrolysis. As mentioned earlier, it was confirmed that the reduction of ZIF-67 at 400 °C generated Co/NC catalysts, and the original morphology of the MOF was retained; consequently, the activities of various Co/NC catalysts with different H2 reduction times at 400 °C were investigated for FAL hydrogenation. As the reduction time increased from 2 to 12 h, the activity gradually increased, and the maximum activity was exhibited by Co/NC-400-6 (Fig. 5b). As the reduction time is increased further, the activity is decreased without change of selectivity. In spite of the higher portion of Co in the unit mass (Table S2), the highly reduced Co/NC-400 catalysts show lower activity because of aggregation of Co during reduction treatment, decreasing the number of active sites (Fig. S3). The conversion of the Co/NC-400-6 catalyst was 99.4%, resulting in a high MF selectivity (49.5%). In a previous study, Co-based catalysts exhibited high activity and high MF selectivities because the CoO and Co surfaces provided excellent sites for FAL with high adsorption energies of −2.39 and −1.90 eV, respectively [11]. Due to the easy cleavage of the C–OH bond of FA, as an adsorption intermediate, on CoO(111) compared to the case on Co(111), the CoO site can facilitate the selective hydrogenation of FAL to FA and subsequent MF production. It was also reported that the reduced phases of CoO and Co showed higher FAL conversion than that of the original mesoporous Co3O4 [11]. From these results, it is clear that the Co/NC catalysts derived from ZIF-67 have abundant Co phases in the N-doped carbon supports, which are responsible for the high FAL activity and MF selectivity. However, the as-prepared ZIF-67 exhibits poor adsorption for FAL because the organic linkers and Co2+ species have very strong bonds. The Co/NC-400 catalysts have different reaction rates depending on the reduction treatment time, as shown in Fig. 5b; however, the overall selectivities toward MF, FA, and FN with small products were very similar. The adsorbed FAL undergoes a comparative reaction between decarbonylation and aldehyde hydrogenation, producing FA and FN, respectively. The produced FA is converted to MF as a final product after the hydrogenolysis of FA. Further experiments confirm these reaction pathways. Fig. 6 shows the change in the FAL conversion and selectivity as a function of the reaction times for Co/NC-400-2 and Co/NC-400-6. With limited reaction times, the conversion for Co/NC-400-2 was lower than that for Co/NC-400-6; however, as the reaction time increased to 10 h, both catalysts reached 100% conversion with similar MF selectivities of 54.7% and 57.5% for Co/NC-400-2 and Co/NC-400-6, respectively (Fig. 6). Over 4 h, the maximum selectivity of FA was reduced at the expense of MF and FN production, demonstrating that the conversion from FA to FAL was reversible to produce FN. In addition, after the complete conversion, MF and FN proved to be the last two main products among the minor saturated products of the furan ring, such as THF and THFA, generated over the Co/NC-400 catalysts. Recyclability tests were conducted 4 times to confirm whether the catalyst could be re-used. A solution of 10 mg of Co/NC-400-6, 20 mL of 2-propanol and 1 g of FAL was charged with 20 bar of H2 and reacted at 180 °C for 3 h. The reaction solution was also taken every 30 min during the reaction to track the time-dependent conversion. The used catalysts were washed with ethanol several times and dried at 80 °C. After the 3 h reaction, complete conversion of FAL was obtained. The reaction rate was also calculated by an aliquot taken after 2 h of the reaction to remain in a kinetically-controlled regime. The reusability results including FAL conversion and reaction rate are shown in Table S3 and Fig. S5–S7. After the first reaction cycle for 3 h, 98.2% FAL conversion was achieved. Conversion gradually decreased in subsequent cycles. As a result, the conversion of the reaction after the 4th cycle was 83.0%. It is due to the deactivation of catalysts caused by the aggregation of Co nanoparticles. The reaction rate of Co/NC-400-6 as the most active form of the Co/NC-400 series decreased as Co nanoparticles become more agglomerated. When the morphology of the Co nanoparticles of the catalyst obtained after the 3rd recycle reaction was observed by TEM, no distinct change in size was observed (Fig. S6). The Co particle size was calculated by Scherrer's equation using the XRD spectrum in Fig. S7. As the number of regeneration reactions increased from 1 to 4, the size of the Co nanoparticles increased from 4.3 to 7.7 nm (Table S4). The reaction rate decreased significantly after the 4th regeneration reaction (Table S3), and this trend can be clearly observed in the TEM image in Fig. S6. Through these results, it was proven that the Co/NC-400-6 catalyst was sufficiently reusable, but the activity decreased as the size of Co nanoparticles increased as the number of regeneration increased. The product selectivity of Co/NC-400 catalysts can be altered by the incorporation of foreign atoms. Cu is a well-known catalyst that promotes high FA selectivity in FAL hydrogenation by the preferential hydrogenation of the carbonyl group of FAL [55,56]. We prepared Cu-incorporated ZIF-67 catalysts to investigate the synergetic effect of Cu in FAL hydrogenation. Fig. 7 a shows the TEM images of Cu-incorporated ZIF-67 catalysts with different concentration of Cu (x-Cu/ZIF). As the Cu concentration was increased from 0.5 to 5 wt%, the original polyhedral structure of ZIF-67 was retained after the Cu incorporation, and the Cu cluster was very small in size. Cu particles were not confirmed by TEM images. However, the 5-Cu/ZIF catalyst, which is a slightly contracted form of ZIF-67, displayed significant Cu clustering (Fig. 7a). The Cu-incorporated ZIF-67 catalysts prepared by the MOCVD have highly dispersed Cu nanoparticles within the ZIF-67 structure; thus, the original pore structure of the catalysts is maintained, as evidenced by EDS, XRD, and N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. S8–10). In the catalytic FAL hydrogenation, the Cu/ZIF catalyst series exhibit higher selectivity toward FA (~50%) than the Co/NC catalysts, due to the role of Cu in the preferential hydrogenation of the carbonyl group of FAL. The overall selectivities were similar for all the Cu/ZIF catalysts used; however, the reaction rate decreased as the content of Cu in ZIF-67 increased (Fig. 7b). Since the reaction rate is normalized by the Cu content of the catalyst, 0.5-Cu/ZIF exhibited the highest reaction rate, due to the highly dispersed Cu nanoparticles in ZIF-67. To avoid the formation of metallic Co from ZIF-67, we used Cu/ZIF catalysts without reduction. When the Cu/ZIF with 10% of Cu was reduced at 300 °C for different times, there was no significant changes in conversion and selectivity for FAL hydrogenation (Fig. S11). It is also found that there was no evidence of CuCo alloy formation during the synthesis or reaction. Scanning TEM image and the corresponding EDS elemental mappings of as-prepared Cu/ZIF catalyst show small Cu particles that are distinguished from Co (Fig. S8). The spent Cu/ZIF catalyst series shows a characteristic peaks of ZIF-67 in XRD (Fig. S9). This indicates that Cu was evenly distributed without aggregation over the ZIF-67 and the entire morphology was preserved after the FAL hydrogenation. To compare the catalytic activity according to the support materal, the 10-Cu/ZIF catalyst was compared with 10 wt% Cu-supported silica (mesoporous silica, MCF-17) and carbon (activated charcoal, Sigma-Aldrich) catalysts. The 10-Cu/ZIF catalyst afforded a FAL conversion of 73.9%, whereas 10-Cu/MCF and 10-Cu/AC showed only 4.5% and 3.9% conversions, respectively, under the same reaction conditions (Table 1). Due to the high surface area and isoreticular pore structure of ZIF-67 (Table S1), the catalytic performance of the Cu/ZIF catalyst in FAL hydrogenation was further improved, compared to the performances of the Cu catalysts with other supports [57]. For further comparison, Cu/C catalysts were prepared by the controlled H2 reduction of HKUST-1 [58]. When FAL hydrogenation was carried out over Cu/C catalysts reduced by H2 at different reduction temperatures at 20 bar of H2 at 180 °C for 5 h, HKUST-250-6 after reduction at 250 °C for 6 h shows the highest FAL conversion with 72.5% of FA selectivity (Fig. S12). The FAL conversion of HKUST-300-6 was significantly lower than HKUST-250-6, due to the high reduction temperature and the corresponding aggregation of Cu nanoparticles."
6,Conclusion,"To determine the best catalyst for FAL hydrogenation, various ZIF-67-derived Co/NC catalysts were prepared by H2 reduction at different temperatures and over different times. The structural evolution of ZIF-67 was monitored by various in situ characterization techniques under an H2 atmosphere. The structural, chemical, and morphological characterizations indicated that the most active Co/NC catalyst, which retained the original shape of ZIF-67 and produced uniformly dispersed Co nanoparticles in the N-doped carbon support, was prepared by H2 reduction at 400 °C. As the reduction time of Co/NC-400 catalyst increased, the fraction of Co0 increased, resulting in high catalytic activity and MF selectivity. It was revealed that Co/NC-400-6 exhibited the highest FAL conversion, and most of the ZIF-67-derived Co/NC catalysts promoted MF as the major product. When Cu species were incorporated into the ZIF-67 network (Cu/ZIF), the selectivity was changed toward FA as the major product due to the preferential hydrogenation of the carbonyl group of FAL. In this study, we can clearly correlate the Co particle size, oxidation state, and the corresponding catalytic performance of FAL hydrogenation. It was concluded that FAL activity was maximized only when the original form of ZIF-67 was maintained without agglomeration of Co nanoparticles. The catalyst with optimized reduction treatment improved the yield of the biomass-upgrading reaction, and the selectivity of the catalyst was changed through the introduction of external elements. This approach is expected to be widely used for the development of high-performance MOF-derived catalysts without requiring precious metals in the future."
