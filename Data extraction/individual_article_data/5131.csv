0,Introduction,"Porous materials, which include inorganic types (e.g., zeolite), organic types (e.g. porous organic polymers (POPs)) and inorganic-organic hybrid types (e.g. metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)), have shown great potential in diverse fields, including gas storage and separation, molecular recognition, energy storage, catalysis, drug delivery etc. [1–4]. Zeolites, constructed from the corner-sharing SiO4- and AlO4-tetrahedra, are one kind of crystalline microporous aluminosilicates, which can be found both in nature and synthesized in the laboratory [1]. Due to the superior thermal and chemical stability, and cheap building blocks, zeolites are highly competitive in commercial applications, especially in adsorption, catalysis, and ion exchange [5]. Nevertheless, a basic challenge in zeolite science is that the rationalization of the synthesis of zeolitic materials with desirable structures is difficult [6]. Moreover, limited by the monotonous building unit, zeolites materials feature a poor structural diversity compared with MOFs and POPs. Ever since the first report on MOFs [7], lots of new types of MOFs have been designed and synthesized. Due to the numerous advantages, such as high surface area, large porosity, inherently tunable chemical structure, flexible architecture, and multifunctional properties, MOFs have been widely investigated in varieties of areas, such as gas storage, chemical sensing, catalysis etc. [8]. Nevertheless, the stability of MOFs (especially against water) is still a key issue which constrains their applications and further commercialization to some extent [9]. Moreover, the high fabrication expense, difficulties in recycling/regeneration also limit the commercial applications of MOFs [8]. Generally, MOFs are inferior to zeolites in thermal and chemical stability, while are superior in terms of tunability and structural diversity due to the constituent metal and organic moieties [10]. In this context, zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIFs), a sub-family of MOFs, which combine the advantages of both zeolites and MOFs, are receiving increasing attentions. ZIFs have exhibited a variety of advantages such as high surface area, high crystallinity, diverse functionalities, and superior thermal and chemical stabilities [11]. Still, the development of novel strategies to construct ZIFs which are cost-saving, scalable and regenerable is of great importance. POPs, which can be found both in crystalline (covalent organic frameworks (COFs)) or amorphous status, are one of the most important organic porous materials. POPs have exhibited well-defined porosity, high surface area, tunable surface chemistry etc., indicating their potential in diverse fields [12]. Specifically, due to the metal-free skeletal structure connected via strong covalent bonds, COFs usually exhibit lower density and higher stability in organic solvents, even under acidic, basic, oxidative, and reductive conditions compared with MOFs [13]. Recently, hydrogen-bonded frameworks (HOFs) have also emerged as a new type of crystalline porous materials because of their unique characteristics [14–16]. According to Chen et al. [17], HOFs are frameworks assembled from the organic units which include both the pure organic and metal-containing organic moieties through hydrogen bonding interactions, and the frameworks can be further strengthened via other weak interactions such as π…π interactions, van der Waals interactions, C-H…π interactions etc. Although the earliest literature on HOFs could date back to 1696 when Duchamp et al. reported the crystalline structure of trimesic acid (1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid) as a building block [18], researches on HOFs remained sluggish for several decades until Wuest and his coworkers designed and prepared a multitude of HOFs since the 1990s [19–32]. Although Wuest et al. had made great contributions to the designing and constructing of a series of HOFs, the potential applications of HOFs were not well explored at that time. In 2010, based on the pioneering work of Wuest et al., Chen et al. reported the first example of microporous HOF with permanent porosity (termed as HOF-1) [33]. HOF-1 also exhibited extraordinary selective separation towards C2H2/C2H4. The establishment of permanent porosity in HOFs opened a new era for the development of HOFs. And from that moment on, extensive interests were resurged on HOFs and versatile applications of HOFs were further explored. HOFs have many unique characteristics compared with other porous materials, including zeolites, MOFs, amorphous POPs, COFs etc. To begin with, in comparison with the coordination bonds in MOFs, Si-O and Al-O bonds in zeolites, covalent bonds in POPs, the hydrogen-bonding linkage in HOFs are weak, which could induce a reversible process during the crystallization, thus giving rise to a high crystallinity. This high-crystallinity structure of HOFs is advantageous for deeply exploring the structure-function relationship, which is difficult for amorphous POPs and zeolites. The relatively weak feature of hydrogen-bonding, on the other hand, makes architectural stability of HOFs usually lower than that of zeolites, MOFs, COFs etc. Then, compared with zeolites, MOFs, POPs which are usually synthesized via hydrothermal or solvothermal methods, HOFs could be easily obtained via traditional crystallization techniques, such as evaporation/cooling crystallization, liquid/gas diffusion etc. The synthesis processes of HOFs are much milder, easier and could be better controlled through different crystallization conditions. In this context, the cultivating and obtaining of fine single crystals of HOFs are much easier compared with that of MOFs, COFs and zeolites. Moreover, the recyclability and reproducibility of HOFs are also superior to MOFs and POPs since HOFs could be easily healed through a recrystallization strategy. In terms of structural diversity and tunability, HOFs could be constructed through a combination of different backbones and hydrogen-bonding units. Thus, HOFs possess tunable pore size, pore shape, pore structure compared with zeolites and amorphous POPs. What’s more, due to an inherently metal-free characteristic, HOFs usually exhibit lower density and toxicity compared with MOFs. In terms of chemical and thermal stability, although HOFs are inferior to inorganic zeolites, they are comparable to MOFs and COFs [17]. Specifically, since HOFs are constructed from the organic moieties which are insoluble in water, they generally exhibit high stability towards water or humidity, which are different from the cases of MOFs. Owing to these properties, HOFs have shown their potential in many areas including gas storage and separation, molecular recognition, proton conduction, biotechnology, and drug delivery etc. The detailed comparisons of HOFs with other porous materials are summarized into the following Table 1 . Nevertheless, the development of HOFs is heavily restricted by their poor stability and impermanent porosity. Compared with MOFs and COFs which are constructed from coordination bonds and covalent bonds respectively, the interactions in HOFs are rather weak and flexible, thus making the fragile HOFs framework easy to collapse after removing the guest molecules and unstable in heat [34–36]. Maintaining the permanent porosity remains a challenging task in HOFs’ developments, and therefore only a small amount of successful cases with permanent porosity have been reported [37]. The establishment of HOFs with permanent porosity and high stability has initiated greater endeavors into the further exploration into HOFs, from design to the promising applications. In this review, some basic rules to construct porous and stable HOFs are summarized. Some important applications of HOFs are presented here, and some latest advances in this area are specifically highlighted. Moreover, the promising perspectives of HOFs are also discussed and the potential directions for future work are suggested."
1,Design of HOFs,
2,Design strategies and principles,"2.1 Design strategies and principles As described above, the major challenge to build HOFs lies in the implementation of permanent porosity, rigidity, and stability of framework, which are hampered by the fragile and weak nature of hydrogen bonds. Learning the lessons from the previous HOFs exploration and construction, some strategies can be employed to construct HOFs with improved stability and rigidity. The first one is to create multiple hydrogen bonds since higher number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds could strengthen the robustness of the whole framework. Therefore, supramolecular synthons with multiple hydrogen bonding sites will be satisfying candidates to construct HOFs [30,38,39]. Moreover, the employing of charged hydrogen-bonding building units is also feasible since the electrostatic attraction could strengthen the hydrogen bonding. The second method is to take advantage of other kinds of intermolecular interactions especially π…π interactions. Although hydrogen bonds play an indispensable role in the construction of HOFs, the contribution of π…π interactions could not be ignored. By looking into the example of SOF-7 and HOF-TCBP [14,40], the importance of π…π interactions could be proved because these two structures exhibited good stability upon heating or aqueous treatments. The employing of π…π stacking is also common in terms of building stable two-dimensional COFs [41,42]. Consequently, the use of planar organic building block with large π-conjugated system would facilitate the formation of structure with extensive and strong π…π stacking forces, and therefore a stable framework. The third approach is to introduce appropriate interpenetrations into the structure of the HOFs. Interpenetration has been regarded as an important feature for MOFs owing to its diverse functions and merits, such as improving the framework physical stability, enduing the framework flexible and dynamic characteristic and fine-tuning pore environments [43–45]. Interpenetrations are expected to enhance the stability of HOFs because they are of lower energy and are thermodynamically favorable. Stoddart et al. have reported the implementation of synthetic control over framework interpenetration of HOFs by exploiting the crystallization conditions [46]. Fourth, the residual hydrogen donors/acceptors after the self-assembly should be avoided because the unpaired hydrogen acceptors/donors may interact with the solvent molecules. This could add extra tension and stress when removing the solvents, thus destroying the whole integrity of frameworks. In this sense, the use of solvents with strong polarity and high boiling points should also be avoided as much as possible. Fifth, the direction of hydrogen bonds is also of great significance for the construction of HOFs. Especially for some binary-component HOFs, a critical approach for enhancing the stability of HOFs and introducing porosity is to adjust the geometric orientation or packing between the different hydrogen-bonded components [47]. The sixth approach is to adopt compounds with rigid backbone as building block. Generally, a building block is comprised of backbone and hydrogen-bonding sites. It has been known that the rigidity and strength of the backbone could obviously affect the robustness of HOFs, thus the building block with a rigid backbone is more favorable in terms of HOFs’ construction [48,49]. Last but not least, shape-fitted docking strategy proposed by Hisaki and Douhal et al. is also a feasible way to make the thermal-stable HOFs with rigid structure [50]."
3,Supramolecular synthons for designing HOFs,"2.2 Supramolecular synthons for designing HOFs In terms of achieving hydrogen-bonded connectivity, there are some basic hydrogen-bonding synthons motifs which can be employed when designing the HOFs (Fig. 1 ) [51]. A great number of building blocks for HOFs construction which take advantage of the fundamental motifs, including the carboxylic acid, pyridine, amide, pyrazole, imide etc, have been reported. Carboxylic acid is one of the most widely used building block to construct HOFs due to its high directionality and predictability [29,47,52]. Based on the carboxylic dimer connection, HOFs including HOF Tcpb, IISERP-HOF1, a series of HAT-based HOFs (CPHAT-1, CBPHAT-1), PFC-1, T12-apo etc. [47,50,53–56] have been designed and synthesized. Amide-based compounds are another important building block for HOFs, which could be seen from the establishment of HOF TTBI, TPBTC(HOF-8) etc. [36,57]. Heterocycle is also a typical building block of HOFs since the pyridine, pyrazole and imidazole rings could all form supramolecular synthons [58]. HOFs such as PETHOF‐1, PETHOF‐2, JLU-SOF1-R, JLU-SOF1-S, FDM-15 etc. have proved the feasibility of this building block [46,59,60]. Apart from these compounds, 2,4-diamino-1,3,5-triazine (DAT) has shown its great versatility and promise in constructing diverse HOFs. DAT has been reported to show three types of dimeric hydrogen-bonding connectivity [58], which has spurred the discovery of a series HOFs including HOF-1, HOF-2, HOF-3, HOF-4, HOF-5, HOF-6, HOF-7 etc. [15,33,35,39,61–63]. Some common ligand types to construct HOFs were summarized into Table 2 . And some representative HOFs and the corresponding functions are also included in this table. The concept of isostructural frameworks has also turned out to be practicable by constructing HOFs from the same molecular geometry but with different sizes or lengths [50,54]. In terms of increasing the diversity of HOFs materials, mixed-ligand strategy is an intriguing method. The combination of acid and basic components could afford robust HOFs [40]. Moreover, sulfonate/guanidium, sulfonate/ammonium, amidinium/sulfonate and amidinium/carboxylate have all been employed to build HOFs [64–67]. To sum up, by judiciously choosing the appropriate hydrogen-bonding units and rigid backbone, and taking advantage of the several strategies mentioned previously, HOFs with good stability and permanent porosity could be obtained. In the meantime, more endeavors are being expected to be put into the design and synthesis of a greater number of versatile HOFs."
4,Applications of HOFs,
5,Gas storage and separation,"3.1 Gas storage and separation Due to the low framework density originating from the employing of light elements (typically H, C, N, O) and the controllable construction via crystal engineering, HOFs, have exhibited their unique advantages in gas storage and separation. By combining the permanent porosity with the large surface area in HOFs materials, their gas adsorption capacities could be expected. Moreover, by constructing the unique pore structure with appropriate pore sizes, binding sites etc., the selective adsorption and separation for some gases could also be achieved through HOFs. 3.1.1 Gas storage HOFs have been reported to possess decent storage abilities for some gases such as H2, CH4, CO2, C2H2, NH3 etc. In terms of designing HOFs for gas storage, pore size, pore shape and porosity are very important factors that could influence the adsorption and storage of HOFs materials. Thus, the choosing of building moieties is of great significance. Generally, the adjustment of pore size and porosity can be achieved through the construction of isoreticular frameworks [58], while the control of pore shape could be attained by employing different kinds of building moieties. Moreover, by pre-considering some possible interactions between the gas molecules and frameworks, the selective adsorption of HOFs for some gases could be achieved, thus resulting in a high adsorption capacity, which will be discussed in some examples below. Just as mentioned before, the HOFs’ development was largely lagged behind MOFs and COFs due to the labile structure. In 2010, Schröder et al. reported a robust HOF (SOF-1) with exceptional thermal stability [74]. The strong N-N…N hydrogen bonds and π-π interactions were found to be responsible for the stability of SOF-1. SOF-1a showed a significant adsorption performance towards C2H2, with an uptake of 124 cm3(STP)g−1 (5.52 mmol g−1) at 1 bar and 195 K. The successful construction of robust SOF-1 has opened the new possibility of developing porous materials by using large polyfunctional organic tectons. With a view to enhancing the storage ability of HOFs for gas, an evident approach is to improve the porosity and surface area of HOFs. In 2012, Mastalerz et al. reported a HOF constructed from triptycenetrisbenzimidazolone (TTBI) with extraordinary high BET surface area of 2796 m2g−1 [57]. This HOF exhibited an excellent adsorption behavior towards CO2 with an uptake capacity of 80.7 cm3g−1 (15.9 wt%) at 273 K and 1 bar. The reason for this high adsorption performance is probably because of the polar surface containing the benzimidazolone subunits which could interact with the quadrupolar CO2. Moreover, the adsorption capacity of this HOF towards H2 is also pleasant, which is 243 cm3g−1 (10.8 mmolg−1; 2.2 wt%) at 77 K and 1 bar. Later in 2017, in order to realize higher porosity, Day and his coworkers et al. reported several polymorphs of TTBI mentioned above by means of energy-structure-function (ESF) maps which combined both the crystal structure prediction and property prediction [69]. In their work, besides the known TTBI (named T2-α in this work), T2-β, T2-γ and T2-δ were also predicted based on the ESF maps. Among them, T2-γ was calculated to have a higher surface area of 3230 m2g−1 and an extraordinarily low density of 0.417 g cm−3, while T2-δ was predicted to be the most stable one among all the possible structures. The experimental crystallization screenings later verified the real existence of T2-β, T2-γ and T2-δ. The experimental and simulated saturation methane uptake capacity of T2-γ at 115 K was 47.4 mol kg−1 (437.4 v STP/v), highlighting its potential for methane adsorption. The experiments also exhibited that T2-β had better propane/methane selectivity than T2-γ. With the ESF maps, more autonomous computer-aided materials with superior functions could be expected in the future. The emissions of CO2 have caused severe environmental and climate issues. In this context, the development and search for suitable porous materials for CO2 capture is of great significance [75]. In 2014, Schröder et al. reported a robust binary HOF (SOF-7) which can be regarded as a cocrystal via solvothermal reaction of 1,4-bis-(4-(3,5-dicyano-2,6-dipyridyl) dihydropyridyl) benzene and 5,5′-bis-(azanediyl)-oxalyl-diisophthalic acid [40]. The activated SOF-7a showed a selective adsorption for CO2 over N2, H2 and CH4. The CO2 uptake capacities were 12.54 wt% (2.85 mmol·g−1) and 6.53 wt% (1.49 mmol·g−1) at 273 and 298 K at 1 bar, respectively. The high-pressure (20 bar) adsorption for CO2 gives an amount of 31.09 wt% (7.07 mmol·g−1) and 24.12 wt% (5.48 mmol·g−1) at 273 and 298 K. SOF-7a also exhibits a reversible CH4 uptake. The CO2/CH4 uptake selectivity at 298 K and 273 K (1 bar) are 9.13 and 14.2, respectively, according to the Henry’s Law. GCMC simulation confirmed the role of amide and cyano groups as binding sites, thus rationalizing the excellent uptake capacity and selectivity for CO2. This group later also reported three other HOFs (SOF-8, SOF-9 and SOF-10) via this binary strategy, among which SOF-8 would suffer framework collapse after removing the guest molecules while SOF-9 and SOF-10 exhibited permanent porosity, good chemical and thermal stability, and solvent/moisture durability [76]. At 1 bar, the activated SOF-9a showed reversible CO2 uptake capacities of 4.09 wt% (0.93 mmol·g−1) and 6.96 wt% (1.58 mmol·g−1) at 273 and 298 K, respectively, and SOF-10a exhibited adsorption capacities of 9.28 wt%(2.11 mmol·g−1) and 5.67 wt% (1.29 mmol·g−1) at these two temperatures. Many other works have also reported the HOFs for CO2 capture [61,77,78]. The removal of NH3 is also of great meaning considering its high toxicity but various applications in chemical industries [79]. Though varieties of porous materials including MOFs, COFs and POPs have been investigated for NH3 removal [80–82], the strong interactions between NH3 and reactive sites make it difficult or energy-consuming for regenerating the materials [82,83]. With the characteristics of mild conditions of regeneration, HOFs could offer new opportunities for NH3 removal when furnished with the specific interaction sites with NH3 via hydrogen bonds. Recently, Hong et al. reported a HOF(KUF-1) constructed from tetrakis(4-sulfophenyl)methane (H4SPM) and guanidine hydrochloride (Gua-HCl) [84] (Fig. 2 ). Multiple hydrogen bonds between the sulfonate O atoms of SPM4− and the NH groups of adjacent GuaH+ moieties direct the self-assembly of the framework. Notably, the activated KUF-1a exhibits a type IV adsorption behavior towards NH3 while shows no adsorption towards N2, H2 and O2. The uptake capacity for NH3 at 283 K and 1 bar is 0.97 mmolg−1. At 298 K, this value increases to 3.41 mmolg−1 at 0.65 bar and then dramatically to 6.67 mmolg−1, which is distinguished from the common trend of type I adsorption behavior. This special adsorption pattern of NH3 in KUF-1a comes along with a structural variation which is caused by the newly-formed hydrogen bonds between NH3 and the backbone of the HOF. Moreover, when regenerated at room temperature under vacuum, the working capacity of KUF-1a almost remains the constant even after 5 cycles, thus highlighting KUF-1a as promising adsorbents for NH3 capture. 3.1.2 Gas separation HOFs have also exhibited their potential in the separation of some gasoline mixtures, such as C2H2/CO2, CO2/CH4, CO2/N2 etc. Specifically, there have been many reports on HOFs for hydrocarbon separation. In the aspect of designing HOFs for gas separation, several strategies could be employed. First, by introducing the strong binding sites into the framework of HOFs, the selective binding of specific gas with the framework could be expected. Then, by precisely controlling the pore size of the HOFs, gas molecules with obvious size differences can be separated through this way. Finally, by constructing unique pore structure or pore surface, the gas separation could also be attained. The separation of C2H2/CO2 is a challenging task since these two compounds have very similar properties in terms of shapes, dimensions, and boiling points. In 2015, Chen’s group reported a rod-packing microporous HOF(HOF-3) which is assembled from a triangular organic building block 3-DAT [35]. The activated HOF-3a shows excellent selectivity for C2H2/CO2 separation. The uptake capacities for C2H2 at 273 and 296 K are 58 cm3g−1 and 47 cm3g−1, which are about twice higher than CO2 adsorption of 31 and 21 cm3g−1 at these two temperatures at 1 atm. When comparing the performance of this HOF with three other MOFs, it is noted that the adsorption selectivity of HOF-3a could reach 21 when the pressure increases to 100 kPa while the selectivity of MPFs is lower than 6. The column breakthrough experiments also highlight the great potential of HOF-3a for industrial acetylene purification application. Moreover, this uptake selectivity was found to be derived from the unique pockets and pore surfaces within HOF-3. Chen et al. also reported a microporous 3D HOF (HOF-5) with a BET surface area of 1101 m2g−1 [61]. At 1 atm, the uptake capacities of HOF-5a for C2H2 at 296 and 273 K are 101.7 cm3/g(STP) and 182.0 cm3/g, which are even comparable to a few MOFs with excellent acetylene storage abilities [85]. The CO2 adsorption capacities of HOF-5a are also superior with the value of 117.1 cm3/g and 90.0 cm3/g at 273 and 296 K (1 atm), respectively. The potential of HOF-5a for gas separation was also conducted. For mixed C2H2/CH4(50:50), CO2/CH4(50:50) and CO2/N2(10:90), the adsorption selectivities for these three mixtures are predicted to be 13.6, 5.0 and 22.4, respectively, at 296 K and 1 atm, underlying the potential of this special HOF for CO2 capture and separation. The membrane-based separation technology has many merits such as low-energy consumption, easy operation and environmental-friendliness [86]. Although other porous materials such as zeolite, MOFs and COFs have been successfully prepared into membrane for gas separation, HOFs which own the merits of mild and simple synthesis conditions, are rarely reported to prepare into membrane [87–89]. Recently, Sun et al. reported the first example of microporous HOF(UPC-HOF-6) membrane constructed from 4′, 4′',4′''-nitrilotris (([1,1′-biphenyl]-4-diaminotriazine)) (NBP-DAT) (Fig. 3 ) [90]. Since the effective separation of H2/N2 mixture is important for synthetic ammonia process when recovering H2 from purge gas, the gas permeation experiments were conducted after activating the UPC-HOF-6 membrane. The experiment results indicated that the UPC-HOF-6-120 membrane possesses a H2 permeance of 461 GPU, and the ideal selectivity for H2/N2 is 11.9 at 298 K and 1.2 bar. Moreover, it is worth noting that H2 permeance could increase significantly from 461 GPU to 1051 GPU when increasing the pressure, while the N2 permeance changes slightly from 39 GPU to 54 GPU, which brings about an enhanced H2/N2 selectivity from 11.9 to 19.5, indicating the pressure-regulated gas membrane separation is possible. The mixed gas separation (H2:N2 = 50 vol%: 50 vol%) tests demonstrated that the membrane owns a H2 permeance of 885.1 GPU and separation factor of 17.2 at 25 °C and 2.0 bar, which balances the permeance and selectivity well when compared with other microporous membranes. What’s more, the separation performance could be retained after 5 swing cycles during 120 h’ separation test. This membrane also exhibits good stability and high mechanical property. Notably, the wounded membrane could be easily healed when treated with DMSO vapor at 120 °C for 15 mins. With all these excellent properties, UPC-HOF-6 is highly promising candidate to separate H2/N2 mixture and more HOF-based membranes are expected. The separation of hydrocarbons is of great significance in the realm of petrochemical industry. Given that the traditional separation techniques such as cryogenic distillation and gas-liquid adsorption is either poor efficient or extremely costly, some alternative methods such as solid adsorbents have been developed [91]. The development of HOFs have opened some new possibilities for hydrocarbon separation, especially a series of remarkable HOFs designed by Chen et al. In 2011, Chen et al. reported the first example of microporous HOFs (HOF-1) with permanent porosity which exhibited superb adsorption selectivity towards C2H2/C2H4 [33]. In this work, the activated HOF-1a could take up acetylene up to 63.2 cm3g−1 (STP) at 273 K (1 atm), while the saturate uptake capacity for C2H4 was only 8.3 m3g−1 (STP), resulting a high separation selectivity of 7.6 for C2H2/C2H4 separation. In 2019, Cao and Liu et al. reported a novel 3D HOF(PFC-2) with a BET surface area of 1014 m2g−1 which shows highly selective separation of acetylene and ethylene versus methane [92]. The adsorption selectivities for PFC-2 were determined to be 27 and 17 for C2H2/CH4 (50/50, v/v) and C2H4/CH4 (50/50, v/v) at 1 kPa, respectively. Metal-complexes were also explored as the building unit of HOFs. In 2018, Chen, Ren and Zhou et al. reported a HOF [Cu2(ade)4(H2O)2]·2SiF6 (termed HOF-21) which was constructed from [Cu2(ade)4] with the corresponding SiF6 2− anions [93]. HOF-21 exhibited efficient separation towards C2H2/C2H4, with C2H2 and C2H4 uptake capacities of 1.98 and 1.27 mmol/g at 298 K and 1 bar, respectively. For C2H2/C2H4 (50:50, v/v) mixture at 298 K and 100 kPa, the adsorption selectivity was estimated to be 7.1. By combining the modelling results with the neutron powder diffraction results, this excellent separation performance was ascribed to the hydrogen-bonding interactions between C2H2 and SiF6 2−. Recently, Bao and Yang et al. further explored the separation performance of HOF-21 towards CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 [94]. Surprisingly, HOF-21 also exhibited outstanding separation performance for CO2/CH4(50:50) and CO2/N2 (15:85) mixture with ideal adsorption selectivities of 21.1 and 131.7 at 273 K and 100 kPa, respectively. The selective adsorption of HOF-21 towards CO2 was due to the “C···F” and “O···H” supramolecular interactions between CO2 molecules and HOF-21. The employing of metal-complexes as the building unit of HOFs has provided more possibilities for the development of HOFs. The removal of C3 and C4 hydrocarbons from light CH4 is also a significant research field, in which HOFs also showed their unique advantages. In 2016, Wu and Yuan et al. reported a robust HOF-TCBP which was constructed from H4TCBP (3,3′,5,5′-tetrakis-(4-carboxyphenyl)-1,1′-biphenyl) [14]. HOF-TCBP not only owned outstanding permanent porosity with a BET surface area of 2066 m2g−1 but also exhibited excellent thermal stability. Moreover, HOF-TCBP exhibited very high uptake ability towards C3 and C4 hydrocarbons while its adsorption ability towards CH4 was rather low, indicating that HOF-TCBP could be employed to separate CH4 from C3 or C4 hydrocarbons. A subsequent separation experiment of C4 hydrocarbons with CH4 (50:50) demonstrated that the selectivities in i-C4H10/CH4, n-C4H10/CH4, 1-C4H8/CH4, (E)-2-C4H8/CH4, and (Z)-2-C4H8/CH4 mixtures were estimated to be 147, 171, 188, 231 and 241 at 1 bar, respectively. This result highlighted the potential of HOF-TCBP for separating and purifying CH4 from higher hydrocarbons. The development of C2H6-selective adsorbent has many practical meanings in the area of C2H4/C2H6 separation, but it remains a challenging task because most adsorbents such as carbons, zeolites and MOFs usually adsorb more C2H4 than C2H6 [95–97]. Recently, Chen et al. reported another robust HOF (HOF-76a) with a BET surface area exceeding 1100 m2g−1 which accomplished the preferential adsorption of C2H6 over C2H4 and the selective separation of C2H6/C2H4 (Fig. 4 ) [98]. In this work, the C2H6 adsorption capacity of HOF-76a is 2.95 mmolg−1 at 1 bar and 296 K, which is higher than the value of C2H4 (1.69 mmolg−1), providing a high C2H6/C2H4 separation ratio of 177%. The simulated and experimental breakthrough results indicated that the separation of C2H6/C2H4 could be achieved very feasibly and efficiently. For the experimental separation of C2H6/C2H4 (50/50) mixture, the pure C2H4 production from the outlet stream for a given cycle were calculated to be 7.2 and 18.8 L/kg at 1 and 5 bar, respectively, which are comparable to some excellent MOFs [99,100], indicating the high potential of HOF-76a for industrial C2H6/C2H4 separation. To explain this special affinity towards C2H6, the DFT calculations indicated that the feature of nonpolar/inert surfaces in HOF-76a and the appropriate triangular channel-like pores which matched with the C2H6 molecules well were responsible for this preferential interaction between C2H6 and HOF-76a. The examples above have proved the great potential of HOFs for gas storage and separation when considering their advantages of solution processability, good and simple recyclability etc. Given that the weak interactions inside the HOFs are difficult to maintain, the permanent porosity is a bottleneck to develop HOFs for gas adsorption and separation. Simultaneously, the porosity of HOFs is generally inferior to that of MOFs and COFs, which may be a disadvantage for gas storage. The weak stability of HOFs has also hampered the application of HOFs in gas adsorption and separation. Great efforts to prepare novel HOFs with permanent porosity are expected in the future. On one hand, more organic moieties which can be employed to build HOFs with permanent porosity are expected to be designed and synthesized to enrich the family of HOFs. Specifically, improving the stability, surface area and porosity are major aims for developing HOFs for gas storage. In this respect, the design and construction of isoreticular structures is a practicable approach to improve the gas storage abilities. On the other hand, a deep understanding of the specific adsorption between HOFs and some gases is of great significance to the design of HOFs for gas separation. The precise control of pore structure and the introduction of specific interaction site are supposed to be the key points to develop HOFs for gas separation."
6,Proton conduction,"3.2 Proton conduction Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCS) have shown their great potential as new alternative energy sources with the merits of high energy density, excellent conversion rate and environment-friendliness [101]. Given that the commercial Nafion membrane has many drawbacks such as complex synthesis process, high expense and amorphous nature [102,103], a variety of new proton conductive materials have been developed including the MOFs, COFs etc. [104–107]. Recently, HOFs have shown their potential in proton conduction area [62,108]. Brønsted acid base pairs could be employed to build HOFs for proton conduction. HOFs designed from Brønsted acid base pairs could result in the hydrogen-bonding interaction network, thus serving as proton conduction pathways. The open channels in HOFs also allow the incorporation of proton carriers. In the water-mediated proton conduction, Brønsted acid-base pairs, acting as the proton donors and acceptors simultaneously, could connect with water molecules to construct the intermolecular hydrogen bonding bridges which could facilitate the protonation and deprotonating process, thus improving the proton conduction. Moreover, the high crystallinity of HOFs render it easy to investigate the pathways and mechanisms of proton transfer with a better understanding of the structure-function relationship. The construction of HOF-based proton conductive materials could be achieved by judiciously choosing the ligands to build the desired supramolecular architecture. Porous guanidinium sulfonate salts are potential materials for proton conduction. In 2016, Ghosh et al. reported two porous 2D HOFs (HOF-GS-10 and HOF-GS-11) based on arene sulfonic acid and guanidinium ions which could form infinite pillar-brick type arrangement (Fig. 5 ) [108]. Owing to the presence of guanidinium cations which serve as the proton source and the sulfonate groups as the proton acceptor, this two HOFs show excellent proton conduction abilities. Moreover, the arene groups which form the pillar of the HOF architecture can improve the water stability of the framework, which is beneficial to the proton conduction performance under the humidified conditions. The proton conduction value increases when raising the relative humidity. The maximum proton conduction value for HOF-GS-10 and HOF-GS-11 was obtained at 95% RH and at 30 °C with a value of 0.75 × 10−2 S cm−1 and 1.8 × 10−2 S cm−1. Moreover, HOF-GS-10 and HOF-GS-11 exhibit a low activation energy value of 0.489 eV and 0.135 eV, which are even comparable to some MOFs (0.16 eV for PCMOF-5) [109]. Water plays a crucial role in the proton conduction process in this work. Compared with HOF-GS-10, HOF-GS-11 featuring a less hydrophobic biphenyl units allow for the accommodation of more water molecules, thus facilitating fast and efficient proton transfer pathway and a higher proton conduction value. With the advantages of low density, good thermal stability, arranged crystalline nature etc., these materials could act as promising candidates of new lightweight materials for PEMFCS. Metal complexes are also employed as building units of HOFs for developing new proton conductive materials. This kind of HOFs are generally designed from cationic metal complexes and anionic sulfonates or carboxylates via charge-assisted hydrogen bonding interactions [110]. Some such HOFs have been reported, where the metal complexes are ligated with proton-donating molecules such as water, ammonia or amines, and these proton-donating molecules would form hydrogen bonding with sulfonate or carboxylate anionic receptors [110,111]. Additionally, anions such as SiF6 2−, Cl−, Br− have also been applied for the constructions of these HOFs [112]. Recently, Das et al. reported three metalo HOFs constructed from [Ni(Imdz)6]2+ (Imdz = imidazole) and arene disulfonates (MHOF1 and MHOF2) or dicarboxylate (MHOF3) which could be used for proton conduction [113].The proton conductivity of these MOFs materials is temperature-dependent and increases with the rising of temperature. The highest proton conduction values of these three HOFs were obtained at 98% RH and 80 °C, with a value of 0.75 × 10−3 S cm−1, 3.5 × 10−4 S cm−1 and 0.97 × 10−3 S cm−1, which are comparable to that of some MOFs and COFs [107,114]. The activation energies for MHOF1-3 are estimated to be 0.90, 0.80 and 1.3 eV, indicating the vehicular mechanism for proton conduction where water molecules serve as carriers to transfer protons from imidazoles in the frameworks, in conjunction with self-ionization of imidazoles [115]. These MHOFs kept constant in proton conduction measurements during heating and cooling cycles, indicating a good recyclability. Li et al. also reported three HOFs based on the metal complexes, named [M2(o-CPhH2IDC)2(H2O)6]·4H2O (M = Co (1) and Zn (2)) and [Mn(o-CPhH2IDC)(2,2′-bipy)(H2O)2] (3) (2,2′-bipy = 2,2′-bipyridine) [116]. The best proton conductivities of these three materials are 1.78 × 10−4, 1.68 × 10−4 and 0.54 × 10−4 S cm−1 under 98% RH and 100 °C. Nonporous HOFs are also applicable to build proton conductive materials. Recently, Su et al. reported two nonporous 2D HOFs constructed from 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid or 1,5-napthalenedisulfonic acid and melamine or piperazine via a solution method and a grinding approach [117]. The resultant HOFs exhibit a high proton conductivity through acid-base pairs, in which sulfonate groups serve as the proton donors and amino groups serve as proton acceptors. When raising the temperature and relative humidity, the proton conductivity of the two HOFs (compound 1 and 2 via solution method) could achieve 1.03 × 10−2 S cm−1 and 1.18 × 10−2 S cm−1, respectively, which are comparable to that of many HOFs and MOFs. Though the above examples have demonstrated the potential of HOFs in proton conductive area, the research into the HOFs-based proton conduction materials are still at an early stage. Still, the inherent disadvantage of HOFs make it difficult to maintain permanent porosity and possess good stability, thus hampering the designing and construction of HOFs for proton conduction. Actually, HOFs are weakly explored in this area compared with the gas storage and separation. But with the inherent merits such as low density, easy synthesis, excellent recyclability, high crystalline structure etc., HOFs-based materials for proton conduction will be intensively investigated and developed in the future, initiating a concoction of new lightweight materials for fuel-cell technologies. In this respect, the design and synthesis of more porous frameworks is of great significance, which could be realized through judiciously selecting the building moiety and controlling the reaction conditions. Thus, more feasible build moieties which could be employed to construct high-performance HOFs for proton conduction are expected to be discovered and designed in the future. With the enrichment of HOFs family for proton conduction, the structure–function relationship could be better understood, thus facilitating the designing of HOFs for proton conduction."
7,Luminescent materials,"3.3 Luminescent materials Luminescent porous materials, including MOFs, COFs and HOFs, have exhibited their great potential in several areas such as chemical sensing, bioimaging, and lighting [118–122]. Attributed to the large π-conjugated system of aromatic moieties which are the common building blocks of HOFs, fluorescence can be obtained for HOFs. Generally, the construction of fluorescent HOFs could be achieved through several approaches as described below. (a) Incorporating AIE (aggregation induced emission) active fluorophores with appropriate backbones and hydrogen-bonding units to make building moiety which can further form fluorescent HOFs; (b) Synthesizing AIE-active building moiety of HOFs such as large π-conjugated moiety according to the origin of fluorescence; (c) AIE-active host molecule interacting with appropriate guest to form fluorescent host-guest HOFs, which can be regarded as a cocrystal strategy. Tetraphenylethylene (TPE), a prototypal AIE fluorophore, which could provide the framework with extraordinary solid-state luminescence properties [123], has been widely used as the basic building block of luminescent HOFs. In 2015, Chen and Xie et al. reported a luminescent HOF (HOF-1111) which could be used to sense the benzene derivatives vapor by using the TPE-DAT4 as the building block [124]. Fluorescence spectra result demonstrates that this HOF shows a maximum emission wavelength at 524 nm and the fluorescence lifetime of this HOF is 2.56 and 4.72 ns. Given that the AIE-based fluorescence of HOF-1111 can be quenched or enhanced in the presence of aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups, the fluorescence variation experiments were carried out using different aromatic compounds. The result indicated that HOF-1111 exhibited good result in terms of both fluorescence quenching and enhancement, thus highlighting the potential of HOF-1111 as a superior chemical sensor. Similarly, Tang and Xu et al. also reported a TPE based HOF(POSS-T8A) with the properties of metal ion sensing by condensing an AIE precursor 4-(1,2,2-triphenylvinyl) benzoic acid and the octa(amino)-substituted POSS derivative [125]. By pre-designing a suitable binding site, HOFs could selectively bind and recognize some ions. For example, in 2017, Chen et al. also reported two solvent-induced HOFs (HOF-10 and HOF-5) which are constructed from a multifunctional organic linker 4,4′,4′′,4′′′-tetra(2,4-diamino-1,3,5-triazin-6-yl)tetra-phenylethene (DAT-TPE), in which the DAT group is a possible metal-binding site (Fig. 6 ) [73]. According to Fig. 6h, HOF-10 and HOF-5 exhibit blue emissions with peaks at 468 and 474 nm, respectively. The quantum yield for HOF-10 and HOF-5 are 0.52 and 0.63, respectively, suggesting an efficient light harvest/emission for these two HOFs. After immersing HOF-10 and HOF-5 in solution containing Ag+, the Ag+-treated HOFs samples could display yellow-green emissions with maximum wavelength of 502 nm and 504 nm, respectively. Particularly, this turn-on fluorescence sensing of Ag+ after UV irradiation is quite sensitive and could be distinguished by the naked eyes, indicating these two HOFs are promising candidates for detecting Ag+ ions. Based on the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, the sensibility of HOF-10 and HOF-5 towards Ag+ is attributed to the binding sites of DAT groups including two amine groups and three triazinyl nitrogen atoms. Recently, Huang and his coworkers reported a family of flexible HOFs named 8PN which are comprised of different pore structures with large-scale void regulation ranging from 4.4% to 33.2% by using 1,1,2,2-tetrakis(4′-nitro-[1,1′-biphenyl]4-yl) ethane (TPE-4pn) as the building block[126]. Eight different kinds of single crystals of 8PN were obtained in different solvents via the solvent evaporation method (Fig. 7 a). These different forms of 8PN show unstructured and broad emission profiles varying from 518 nm to 580 nm (Fig. 7b) with lifetime ranging from 0.93 ns to 4.4 ns. 8PN could realize multimode reversible structural transformation when responding to different external stimuli, in which process 8PN could exhibit abundant changes in luminescence properties such as emission color, lifetime and brightness. This visible and detectable structural transformations highlight the potential of 8PN for chemical sensing, data recording, biomedical imaging, light-emitting devices, and other smart materials. Besides the TPE derivatives, hexaazatriphenylene (HAT) derivative, another rigid π-conjugated heterocyclic moiety possessing six carboxyaryl groups, is also a suitable building block for constructing thermally and chemically stable HOFs. Recently, Hisakai and Douhal et al. reported a stable HOF (CBPHAT-1) assembled from an expanded HAT derivative with carboxybiphenyl groups (CBPHAT) [50]. The activated crystalline material CBPHAT-1a has a BET surface area of 1288 m2g−1 and exhibits protic solvent tolerability, even in HCl. Bulk CBPHAT-1a displays a green-yellow emission with maximum intensity around 500 nm and shows a fluorescence quantum yield of 5.7%. It is worth noting that CBPHAT-1a single crystals show highly anisotropic emission behavior. By comparing a similar work of this group about CPHAT-1a HOF, it could also be concluded that the expansion of the aryl arm in CBPHAT-1a and the variation of the pore size would not evidently change the optical and photophysical properties of the resultant HOFs. HAT derivatives with different length of aryl groups are under further investigation in this group to develop HOFs with larger pores and higher stability. Phosphorescence has greater potential than fluorescence in terms of bioelectronics and optoelectronics [120].Though fluorescence of HOFs have been widely reported, developing metal-free phosphorescent HOFs with ultralong lifetime is a big challenge because of the inefficient intersystem crossing (ISC) resulted from weak spin orbit coupling (SOC), fast nonradiative decay rate of the triplet excitons and some uncertain quenching factors from the environment [127,128]. The ultralong organic phosphorescence has become possible by combining the introduction of an aromatic carbonyl group which could promote the intersystem crossing and the establishment of a rigid environment which suppresses the nonradiative transitions [129,130]. Inspired by these ideas, An and Huang et al. have reported a method to develop HOFs with ultralong phosphorescence by forming the intralayer π-π interactions in HOFs, which could favor the stabilization of triplet excitons to generate phosphorescence [131]. In this work, a three-armed aromatic self-assembly precursor PhTCz containing aromatic carbonyl and π-conjugated carbazole groups was firstly designed and three HOFs based on PhTCz were obtained under different experimental conditions, namely, PhTCz-1, PhTCz-2, and PhTCz-3 (Fig. 8 ). These three HOFs were all formed by intralayer π-π stacking interactions and interlayer C-O…H hydrogen bonding. For PhTCz-1, a green fluorescence (emission peak = 516 nm) and yellow ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) with a main peak at 544 nm and with a lifetime of 79.8 ms under ambient conditions were observed simultaneously. According to the experimental and theoretical analysis, the UOP comes from the stabilization of the triplet excitons via strong coupling of intralayer π-π interactions in HOFs. However, PhTCz-2 and PhTCz-3 only exhibit bright green fluorescence under the same condition and no UOP could be observed by the naked eyes. It is worth noting that the yellow ultralong phosphorescence for PhTCz-2 and PhTCz-3 could be achieved under the N2 atmosphere. The lifetime of phosphorescence for PhTCz-1, PhTCz-2 and PhTCz-3 could be prolonged to 198, 69 and 92 ms in N2, respectively. Moreover, the UOP intensity of PhTCz-2 and PhTCz-3 crystals decreases with the rising of oxygen concentration, indicating their potential for oxygen sensing. This group has also reported a HOF (MA-IPA) with UOP properties through assembly of melamine (MA) and aromatic acids in aqueous media, which could be employed in barcode identification in darkness [132]. In consideration of the drawbacks of the biotoxicity and scarcity of noble metal, harsh preparation conditions for MOFs and COFs, phosphorescent HOFs seem to have broad application prospects due to their mild synthesis conditions and good recyclability. Still, due to the inherent instability and vulnerability, the development of luminescent HOFs is lagged. Specifically, for phosphorescent HOFs, the construction of organic phosphorescent materials with high efficiency and ultralong lifetime is originally a challenge. What’s more, since the discovery of HOFs, most researches were focused on the synthesis of HOFs and the control of their porosity, while the luminescent HOFs were rarely investigated and reported. In terms of the future study, a thorough research into the photophysical and photochemical properties of HOFs are expected, since they are the basis for the construction of luminescent HOFs. Moreover, the building blocks for constructing luminescent HOFs with improved properties such as quantum efficiency and lifetime are expected to be designed and synthesized, especially for the construction of phosphorescent HOFs. Anyway, more intensive endeavors and greater development in this area are expected in the future."
8,Heterogeneous catalysis,"3.4 Heterogeneous catalysis The development of heterogeneous catalysis is of great significance in the development of chemical and pharmaceutical industry [133]. Continued endeavors have been made to search for the new heterogeneous catalysts with high efficiency and simple reproducibility. Diverse heterogeneous catalysts derived from MOFs and COFs have been reported in recent years with improved activity, stability and porosity [134–137]. In contrast to this, reports on HOF-based catalysts are still very scarce until recently due to the relatively poor stability of HOFs. Nevertheless, mild synthetic conditions and the superior reproducibility of HOFs via simple recrystallization make HOFs very promising candidates for heterogeneous catalysts. The implementation of HOFs-based catalysts could be realized mainly through several strategies: first is to encapsulate the catalysts such as metal nanoparticles in the pores of HOFs; second is to employ the moieties with catalytic units as building block of HOFs; and the last is to expose the catalytic sites on the pore walls by designing the pore surface. In 2019, Wang, Chen, Jiang et al. reported the example of HOFs-based catalyst via post-synthetic metalation of HOF-19 [138]. This HOF-19 is synthesized by using a novel organic cage of amino-substituted bis-(tetraoxacalix[2]arene[2]triazine) (L) which is composed of five six membered-aromatic rings as building block. Multiple N-H···N hydrogen bonds between intercage 2-aminotriazinyl (AT) groups and π···π interactions between intercage benzene moieties help stabilize the structure of HOF-19. The resultant HOF features 2D porous hydrogen-bonded supramolecular structures containing 1D channels with the size of 8.0 × 13.6 Å, which further pack into the 3D architecture of HOF-19. HOF-19 is poorly soluble in common organic solvents and its BET surface area was estimated to be 685 m2g−1. The immersion of activated HOF-19 in an acetone solution of palladium acetate could produce the palladium-(II)-containing HOF-19 ⊃ Pd (II). HOF-19 ⊃ Pd (II) was proved to have a decent catalytic activity towards the Suzuki − Miyaura coupling reaction. By employing 0.260 mmol % HOF-19 ⊃ Pd (II), the halogenated benzene substrates could successfully transform to corresponding coupling products in the high isolation yields of 96–98% within a short time of 1.5–2.5 h, which is even comparable to the COFs-based catalyst (COF-LZU1 ⊃ Pd-(II) [139]. The recyclability of HOF-19 ⊃ Pd (II) catalyst was evaluated in the conversion reaction of 4-bromobenzonitrile. The result indicated that even after four reaction cycles, this HOF-based catalyst still maintained excellent catalytic activity and good crystallinity. Moreover, this catalyst could be regenerated by a simple recrystallization method, with 92% isolation yield retaining toward 4-bromobenzonitrile. This work highly reveals the great potential of HOFs materials in heterogeneous catalysis area. Porous solid materials with Brønsted acid sites (BASs) have been widely employed in chemical and petrochemical industries as environmentally friendly heterogeneous catalysts [140]. Though MOFs have been widely explored as asymmetric catalysts, the reports on Brønsted acidic MOFs which have catalytic activity are rare because preparing chiral MOFs with strong BASs from sulfonated or phosphonated organocatalysts is difficult [141–143]. The mild synthetic conditions for HOFs allow the rational design of crystalline frameworks with reactive functional groups, thus offering a potential complement to MOFs. Recently, Liu et al. reported a cage extension strategy to construct chiral permanent porous hydrogen-bonded frameworks with strong BASs for heterogeneous asymmetric catalysis [144]. Two octahedral coordination cages were constructed by using M4-calixarene (M = Ni and Co) as the square unit and the multitopic ligand 4,4′,6,6′-tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)-1,1′-spinol phosphonate (H4L) as the potential triangular unit (Fig. 9 ). With the phosphoric acids containing in the framework of 1-Ni and 1-Co HOFs, they show a catalytic activity towards the asymmetric [3 + 2] coupling of indoles with quinone monoimine and Friedel-Crafts alkylations of indole with aryl aldimines. For the reaction of 3-methyl indole and 4-methyl-N-(4-oxocyclohexa-2,5-dienylidene)benzenesulfonamide, the presence of 0.04 mol% loading of 1-Ni (0.04 μmol cage) could promote the reaction to proceed smoothly with a 92% yield of benzofuroindoline and ee of 99.9% within 14 h. For the reaction of asymmetric F-C alkylations of indole and aryl aldimines, a variety of aryl-substituted aldimines containing different groups on the aromatic rings were tolerated, affording 89–99% isolated yields with 90–99.7% ee. More importantly, these two HOFs-based catalysts could be recycled and reused for at least 10 cycles with negligible loss of efficiency and enantioselectivity. This work has provided a new avenue to developing highly enantioselective heterogeneous Brønsted acid catalysts based on HOFs. Due to the ability of generating singlet oxygen under photo irradiation, porphyrin-based compounds could provide effective photocatalytic activity and photothermal therapy effects for cancers [145,146]. Recently, Sun et al. reported the controlled preparation of meso-tetrakis(carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP)-based HOFs for photocatalysis by blocking the strong hydrogen-bonded building units on the TCPP backbones [147]. In this work, both the kinetically and thermodynamically favored HOFs TCPP-2 (DMF), TCPP-4 (DMF) and TCPP-6 (DMF) were obtained at three temperatures, i.e. 120,130 and 140 °C. The number of DMF molecules not only played a dominant role in the thermal stability and permanent porosity of TCPP-based HOFs but also affected the photocatalytic activity of HOFs. A positive correlation between the numbers of DMF molecules and the photocatalytic activities was found and established. The singlet oxygen generated with TCPP-6 (DMF) could degrade 99% 9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA) upon photoirradiation within 100 min, with a quantum efficiency of 52%. Moreover, the crystallinity of TCPP-6 (DMF) kept intact after the photocatalysis application, indicating a good reusability. The reports and investigations on the HOF-based heterogeneous catalysts are still very scarce compared with that of MOFs and COFs. Nevertheless, considering the unique advantages of HOFs such as mild conditions of synthesis, good recyclability and simple reproducibility, intensive research interests towards the HOFs-based catalysts are wished to be inspired by the above work. In this respect, a primary question is to further improve the stability of HOFs and equip the HOFs with permanent porosity. Then, the varieties of HOFs-based heterogeneous catalysts are being expected to be further explored. The strategies to obtain the HOFs-based heterogeneous catalysts also needs a further investigation."
9,Biotechnology and medical applications,"3.5 Biotechnology and medical applications Owing to the several advantages that HOFs possess, such as being metal free inherently, biocompatible and having larger pore apertures, they are also desirable candidates for biotechnology and medical applications, among which the drug delivery is one of the most promising applications. By combining the robust and porous frameworks with the photosensitizer group which could generate singlet oxygen, the drug-delivery HOFs with the effect of photodynamic therapy could be achieved. In 2018, Liu and Cao et al. synthesized a robust HOF named PFC-1 by using 1,3,6,8-tetrakis (p-benzoic acid) pyrene (H4TBAPy) as the building block [55]. The resultant PFC-1 features a combination of O-H···O (2.597 Å) hydrogen bonds between the adjacent H4TBAPy molecules and face-to-face π-π stacking interactions (interlayer distance 3.338 Å), which contributes to the structural stability and robustness of this HOF. PFC-1 exhibits a BET surface area of 2122 m2/g and superior chemical stability in water, methanol, acetone and concentrated HCl (12 M). The crystallinity of the framework could retain up to 250 °C according to the TGA and VT-PXRD result. It is worth noting that the thermal impairment of PFC-1 could be easily repaired by acid-assisted crystalline redemption, which was firstly observed for HOFs materials. With the merits of large pore size, excellent chemical stability, biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity, PFC-1 is an outstanding drug carrier for doxorubicin, exhibiting a high loading of 26.5 wt%. In the meantime, the periodic integration of pyrene in PFC-1 has the ability of generating singlet oxygen, thus enabling PFC-1 to be used for photodynamic therapy (PDT). The in-vitro studies on Hela cell (human cervical cancer) demonstrate that Doxo@Nano-PFC-1 shows the synergetic chem-photodynamic therapy with the advantages of excellent biocompatibility, low cytotoxicity, and superior therapeutic efficacy. Recently, Sun et al. firstly reported atomically thin 1D porous nanoribbons (nr-HOF) which were exfoliated from the 3D hydrogen-bonded organic framework (HOF) TCPP-1,3-DPP [148]. This resultant nr-HOF exhibits a fully exposed surface and strong surface adsorption ability, making nr-HOF an excellent carrier for anticancer drug Doxo with an uptake capacity of 29.4%. In contrast, the loading capacity of Doxo on the 3D TCPP-1,3-DPP HOF is only 16.5%, indicating the superiority of atomically thin nanoribbon for drug delivery. Simultaneously, the nr-HOF exhibits a higher efficiency than bulk HOF in terms of the generation of singlet oxygen, indicating a better synergistic chemotherapy-PDT-PTT effect. This work has not only presented a superior drug carrier with the merits of considerable biocompatibility and high therapeutic efficacy, but also has opened an avenue for the exploitation of novel 2D materials from HOFs with appealing properties and applications. Apart from the applications in drug delivery, HOFs have also been explored to protect the biological assemblies. Recently, Christian J. Doonan et al. reported a biocompatible HOF named BioHOF-1 which was constructed from water-soluble tetra-amidinium (1·Cl4) and tetracarboxylate (2) building blocks [149]. Fluorescein-tagged catalase (FCAT) was encapsulated into the BioHOF-1 to obtain the FCAT@BioHOF-1 biocomposite (Fig. 10 ). This crystalline biocomposite has pore dimensions and is stable in water over a wide range of pH (5–10), polar organic solvents and phosphate buffers. The confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) result demonstrated that the FCAT molecules were dispersed homogeneously within the FCAT@BioHOF-1 crystal. The catalytic activity was broadened greatly to a wide pH range of 5–10 by coating the BioHOF-1, showing its great application potential at low pH values compared with that of the ZIF-based biocomposites [150,151]. The thermo-stability of the encapsulated FCAT was also improved significantly, maintaining ca. 79% of its initial activity after 30 min at 60 °C while the bare FCAT lost its activity quickly under the same condition. FCAT@BioHOF-1 also retained its activity at a high level under the exposure of trypsin (a proteolytic agent) and urea (a chaotropic agent) or even after ten catalysis/filtration cycles. Later, the author also employed this encapsulation strategy to synthesize another HOF-based biocomposite of alcohol oxidase (AOX), which also showed a good effect of enzyme encapsulation and protection. These results have illustrated the potential of HOFs in biomolecule protection area. By now, reports on HOFs for drug delivery and biotechnology are still scarce. With further exploration in the precise control over the topology, pore structure and chemistry of HOFs, more and more new types of HOFs will developed and employed in the areas of biotechnology and drug delivery etc."
10,Other applications,"3.6 Other applications The application area of HOFs are far more than the contents mentioned above. Actually, HOFs have also shown their prospects in many other fields, such as molecular recognition, dye filtration, gas sensor etc. For example, Chen et al. reported the synthesis and application of HOF-2 which was constructed from a BINOL derivate [39]. This HOF-2 possesses a special characteristic of chiral pore, which stimulates the authors to investigate its ability for enantioselective separation of small alcohols. Specifically, HOF-2 exhibits a high chiral separation for 1-phenylethanol (1-PEA) with an e.e. value of 92%. As for the reason for this efficient separation, the confinement of the chiral pockets caused by the chiral BINOL scaffolds together with the strong hydrogen bonding between the –OH groups and the R-1PEA is responsible for the enantioselective separation. Similarly, Li et al. also reported the specific molecular recognition phenomenon of HOFs [70]. In their work, a highly symmetric HOF (FDM-15) was constructed through N-H…N hydrogen bonds between H3TBI molecules. This HOF shows a selective adsorption of p-xylene over toluene owing to a stronger interaction between FDM-15 and p-xylene resulted from the σ-π hyperconjugation. Moreover, the large channel diameter of 11.5 Å also makes it possible for FDM-15 to act as nanoporous tubes encompassing large incoming molecules with tailored-fitting interaction, which has been proved to be true in the case of adsorption of fullerene. With 420 times’ enhancement on concentration of fullerene in FDM-15 pores, the potential of this materials to selective adsorb and gather π-electrons-abundant guest molecules is highlighted. HOFs could also be employed in environment remediation. For instance, Ke and his coworkers have reported a crystalline microporous hydrogen-bonded cross-linker organic framework HCOF-1 which combines the merits of both COFs and HOFs [152]. Being synthesized from single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation, HCOF-1 exhibits a high uptake capacity towards I2 which is comparable to some excellent MOFs and porous polymers [153–156]. Strikingly, HCOF-1 could remove I2 directly from the aqueous environment at ambient temperature with a rapid speed, which had not been reported for MOFs or porous polymers before. During this process, HCOF-1 underwent an obvious density change and a transformation from crystalline structure to amorphous morphology. Moreover, HCOF-1 could recover its crystallinity by releasing the I2, indicating its potential in practice for removal or enrichment of I2. Recently, Luo and Yao et al. demonstrated an example of HOFs for dye filtration [157]. They constructed three HOFs (HOIF 1–3) by using both the organic and inorganic moiety as the building block. The HOIF membranes were prepared by dissolving and transferring a single crystal of HOIF-1 onto anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates, and were then used to remove the pollutant dyes in effluents. The result indicated that rhodamine B (RhB), reactive blue 19 (RB 19) and trypan blue (TB) could be removed via this membrane with a selective filtration capability of 61.2%, 50.6% and 51.9% respectively. Given that the unmodified bare AAO membrane showed no filtration towards these dyes, the dominant filtration ability was attributed to HOIF-1. Recently, Wang and Jiang et al. reported a brand-new branch of organic semiconductor gas sensor which was developed from a porphyrin-based HOF (UPC-H4a) via a single suspension deposit method [158]. Resulting from the ordered distribution of free –NH2 groups along the 1D channels of UPC-H4a, the UPC-H4a sensor exhibits a high sensitivity and a limit of detection (LOD) lower than 40 ppb towards NO2, which is far below the annual safety limits (109.6 ppb) regulated by the World Health Organization. Furthermore, this gas sensor owns an ultra-fast response/recovery rate (17.6 s/15.4 s over 100 ppb). What’s more, this peculiar UPC-H4a based gas sensor exhibits excellent recyclability and long-term stability. This work has provided a new alternative for designing sensors with high selectivity and low LOD value. The diverse applications of HOFs have been summarized in the following Table.3 ."
11,Conclusions and perspectives,"In conclusion, the emergence of HOFs has provided an intriguing platform for structural and functional design of multifunctional porous materials. Owing to their excellent properties such as mild preparation conditions, solution processability, highly-crystalline structure, simple characterization, facile recyclability through simple re-crystallization etc., HOFs have shown their potential in multiple fields, including gas storage and separation, proton conduction, luminescent materials, heterogenous catalysis, molecular recognition etc. Specifically, resulting from the inherent metal-free nature and composition of light elements, HOFs own good biocompatibility and biodegradability, which makes them promising candidates for drug delivery and biotechnology applications. Although some progress has been made in terms of HOFs’ construction and design, their development is far behind MOFs and COFs. By judiciously combining the rigid backbone and hydrogen bonding units with multiple hydrogen-bonded sites, robust HOFs with permanent porosity and good stability are expected to be constructed with the help of interpenetrations and π…π interactions. The robustness and permanent porosity remain a major challenge in the construction of HOFs, and more efforts are expected to be put into to solve this issue. In terms of the future development of HOFs, some challenges and problems need to be addressed. To begin with, more strategies which are feasible for constructing HOFs with permanent porosity, high surface area, excellent stability are highly in demand. In this sense, the further exploration and investigation of new hydrogen bonding units, backbones etc. which can be used to construct HOFs is of great significance and necessity, because only when the chemistry of HOFs is abundant enough could we truly achieve the controllable design and synthesis of multifunctional HOFs materials. Secondly, since the pore structures are crucial for the specific recognition and separation of targeted guest molecules with specific sizes and shapes, precise control of pore chemistry is becoming increasingly important when a tailor-made pore structure is in need. The special design and decoration of pore interface is also of great importance. Moreover, the correlation of structure and function needs to be further explored and understood in order to provide us more and better guidelines to prepare multifunctional HOFs. The multitudinous characterization techniques and computer simulation technology could be favourable for revealing this correlation. Last but not least, more methods for manipulating size, morphology and polymorph of HOFs need to be developed to make the ideal HOFs with best performance. The current research advances have fully demonstrated the broad application prospects of HOFs materials, and their application field is absolutely not limited to the contents introduced above. A greater number of endeavours and innovations are expected to lead an in-depth exploration into HOFs. In a word, a much more intriguing and attractive platform of porous materials could be built by HOFs."
