0,Introduction,"Recently, growing environmental concern and an increasing energy demand are driving the search for new, sustainable sources of energy. In particular, solar molecular hydrogen (H2) has attracted much attention because it can be regarded as a renewable and clean-burning energy source. Among the proposed technologies for its production, the photocatalytic conversion of biomass derived compounds is currently being discussed and investigated extensively [1,2]. Titanium dioxide is believed to be the most promising presently known photocatalyst, because of its superior photoreactivity, its nontoxicity, its long-term stability, and its low price; thus, many reports have been published concerning photocatalytic H2 production activities [3–5]. Despite the fact that TiO2 generally exhibits relatively high photocatalytic activity towards the degradation of organic compounds under UV illumination in the presence of molecular oxygen, it usually does not show any ability to photocatalyse the H2 evolution in oxygen free systems even in the presence of an electron donor. When TiO2 absorbs a photon the energy of which exceeds its bandgap energy, an electron (e−)/hole (h+) pair is generated. Both, e− and h+, can either migrate to the TiO2 surface and react with adsorbed reactants in a photocatalytic process, or they may undergo an undesired recombination. In the presence of an electron donor, such as methanol, and in the absence of O2, the excess holes will be consumed and the photogenerated electrons will be trapped near the surface forming tri-valent titanium (Ti3+) sites instead of reducing H+. This phenomenon has been observed by Bahnemann et al. [6] in laser-flash photolysis experiments employing suspensions of colloidal TiO2. Loading the TiO2 surface with small Pt islands creates sinks for the electrons thus facilitating the separation of e−/h+ pairs photogenerated in TiO2 and promoting the formation of H2 gas [7–11]. Methanol is frequently used as an electron donor in so-called “sacrificial systems” for the photocatalytic H2 production; however, only a few mechanistic study of this system have been published [12,13]. Some reports describe the photocatalytic H2 production from aqueous methanol solutions as water splitting [14–18], while other reports describe the process as dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde or reforming of methanol to carbon dioxide [1,8]. Moreover, only little information exists concerning the photonic efficiency of this process and hardly any information concerning the effect of the light intensity on the rate of the photocatalytic H2 evolution over Pt-loaded TiO2 from aqueous methanol solution; however, this type of information is available for the photocatalytic oxidation of methanol in the presence of TiO2 in aerated systems [8,19]. Hence, the photocatalytic H2 production from aqueous methanol solutions over Pt-loaded commercial (Evonik Aeroxide TiO2 P25 and Sachtleben Hombikat UV100) and home made (TiO2 P25HT) titanium dioxide nanomaterials has been studied. The photonic efficiencies have been calculated. The effect of the employed light intensity has been investigated. The products of the photocatalytic methanol oxidation have been qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed employing different test conditions, i.e., different illumination times, pH values, and methanol concentrations. In particular, the balance between the amount of evolved H2 and the sum of the photocatalytic methanol oxidation products has been checked."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation and characterization of TiO2 photocatalysts,"2.1 Preparation and characterization of TiO2 photocatalysts TiO2 anatase nanoparticles have been prepared by the hydrothermal treatment of TiO2 P25 in alkaline solution. Typically, 1.0g TiO2 and 100ml NaOH aqueous solution (10M) were mixed and magnetically stirred for 2h. The resulting suspension was poured into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (Berghof, DAB-3) and then heated in an electric furnace held at 120°C for 24h. The autoclave was allowed to naturally cool down to room temperature. The resulting white precipitate was vacuum filtrated and washed with HCl solution (0.1M) and deionized water until neutrality (pH 7). The obtained precipitate was redispersed in HCl solution (0.5M HCl) and stirred overnight followed by filtration and thorough washing with deionized water. The isolated powder was dried at 70°C in an oven and post-heated in air atmosphere at 400°C for 2h (denoted TiO2 P25HT). 0.5wt% Pt-loaded TiO2 photocatalysts have been prepared by a photochemical deposition method [20]. The bare and Pt-loaded TiO2 photocatalysts have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms, field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). The details of the measurements have been described elsewhere [21,22]."
3,Photocatalytic H2 production test,"2.2 Photocatalytic H2 production test The photocatalytic H2 production tests have been performed in a double jacket Duran glass reactor (110cm3) with three outlets as described elsewhere [20]. A 10-cm water bath and a black bandpass filter (3mm, UG1 SCHOTT glass) restricting the incident light to wavelengths between 300 and 400nm were used during photon flux and photonic efficiencies measurements. The light intensity was adjusted by using neutral density filters (1.5mm, LOT-ORIEL)."
4,Analysis of the methanol photooxidation products,2.3 Analysis of the methanol photooxidation products The amount of formaldehyde formed during the photooxidation of methanol has been determined by the Nash method [23] using a Varian Cary 100 spectrophotometer. The concentration of formic acid has been determined using a high performance DIONEX ICS-1000 ion chromatograph [20]. A Shimadzu gas chromatograph coupled with a mass spectrometer (GC-MS-QP 5000) has been used to detect any other intermediates and products.
5,Results,
6,Photocatalysts characterization,"3.1 Photocatalysts characterization The XRD diffraction patterns of TiO2 P25 before and after hydrothermal treatment are shown in Fig. S1a and b, respectively (see supplementary data). A comparison of both XRD diffraction patterns clearly indicates that a phase transformation from the anatase and the rutile phases to the titanate (H2Ti4O9.H2O) structure occurs during the hydrothermal treatment. Calcination of the titanate at 400°C for 2h leads to the formation of the pure anatase phase as confirmed by the XRD measurement (see Fig. S1c) [24]. The BET surface area values and the Rietveld analysis of the XRD patterns for the investigated photocatalysts are given in Table S1 (see supplementary data). Interestingly, the BET surface area of the anatase nanoparticles (TiO2 P25HT) is found to be 3.5 times larger than that of the starting material, i.e., TiO2 P25. The Pt-loaded photocatalysts have also been characterized by X-ray diffraction and BET surface area measurements. The obtained diffraction patterns indicate that all the diffraction peaks of TiO2 P25HT and of TiO2 UV100 can be indexed to the anatase phase, whereas the rutile phase only exists in case of TiO2 P25. No diffraction peaks are detected for Pt particles indicating that these are highly dispersed and very small particles. The quantitative phase composition and the crystallite diameters of Pt-loaded TiO2 photocatalysts as evident from the Rietveld analysis of the XRD data as well as the BET surface areas are also given in Table S1. The results indicate that the BET surface area of TiO2 P25HT, of TiO2 P25, and of TiO2 UV100 decreases following the Pt loading indicating that the Pt nanoparticles are deposited on the surface blocking some of the active sites for N2 adsorption. The morphologies of TiO2 P25 before and after the hydrothermal treatment were investigated by FE-SEM. The obtained micrographs are shown in Fig. S2 (see supplementary data). It is obvious from the micrograph shown in Fig. S2a that TiO2 P25 consists of secondary agglomerated particles formed from primary particles with an average particle size of about 25nm. The micrograph shown in Fig. S2b also demonstrates that the hydrothermal treatment of TiO2 P25 leads to the transformation from the spherical to a fiber like morphology. The subsequent calcination of this fiber like titanate material yields anatase nanoparticles exhibiting a rod like morphology. It seems that the fiber like particles are completely destroyed during the calcination step yielding small rods as confirmed by HR-TEM (see Fig. S3, supplementary data). The particle size of TiO2 P25HT is found to be about 10nm in good agreement with the crystallite size obtained from the XRD data analysis. The interesting point is that the hydrothermal treatment of TiO2 P25 and the post heat treatment yields anatase nanoparticles with an average particle size that is about two times smaller than that of the starting material (TiO2 P25)."
7,Photocatalytic H2 production,"3.2 Photocatalytic H2 production Fig. 1 shows the time courses of the photocatalytic H2 evolution from aqueous methanol solution (0.03M, 2.25mmol methanol) over 0.5wt% Pt-loaded TiO2 photocatalysts, namely, TiO2 P25, TiO2 UV100, and TiO2 P25HT. It is obvious from Fig. 1 that TiO2 UV100 exhibits higher activity than TiO2 P25 and even than TiO2 P25HT. It is also obvious that bare TiO2 photocatalysts without Pt loading do not exhibit photocatalytic H2 evolution activity. No H2 was evolved in the dark as well as under illumination in the absence of a photocatalysts. The rate of the photocatalytic H2 evolution is found to strongly depend on the methanol concentration initially present in the suspension (see supplementary data Fig. S4). It increases with increasing methanol concentration and then levels off to reach a plateau. Thus, a low methanol concentration (0.03M, 2.25mmol methanol) was employed during the photocatalytic experiment to avoid the high overpressure generated by the evolved H2 at high methanol concentration allowing for longer reaction times in the sealed reactor. These experimental conditions also allow to investigate the possibility of water photooxidation in more detail. The photonic efficiency of the photocatalytic H2 evolution was, however, calculated employing high methanol concentrations (4.93M, 370mmol methanol) in the plateau region of Fig. S4 in order to determine the maximum efficiency. No H2 was detected in the absence of methanol, i.e., when pure water is employed [10,11]. To investigate the effect of the light intensity on the rate of the photocatalytic H2 evolution, the latter were determined at different light intensities. The corresponding photonic efficiencies (ζ) have been calculated by dividing the H2 production rate by the photon flux, I 0, which was determined under the same conditions using ferrioxalate actinometry [25,26]. Fig. 2 shows plots of the rate as well as the photonic efficiency as a function of the applied light flux. As shown in Fig. 2 a non-linear relation between the rate of H2 evolution and the employed light flux was observed. The most interesting observation is that TiO2 UV100 and TiO2 P25HT, which both consist of pure phase anatase, exhibit the same behavior. They show a slight deviation from a linear dependence between the rate of the H2 evolution and the light intensity at high light intensities. However, in case of TiO2 P25, which is a mixture of rutile and anatase nanoparticles, the rate of photocatalytic H2 evolution only increases initially with increasing light intensity quickly reaching a plateau of constant rate."
8,Analysis of photocatalytic methanol oxidation products,"3.3 Analysis of photocatalytic methanol oxidation products The balance between the amount of photocatalytic methanol oxidation products and the amount of H2 gas evolved has been checked. The products were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed following different illumination times and working at different pH values employing different methanol concentrations. In all experimental runs, formaldehyde, formic acid, and carbon dioxide were the only detected reaction products. The quantitative results of the analysis are listed in Table 1 . They indicate that after 3h of UV–Vis illumination of aqueous methanol solutions (0.03M, 2250μmol methanol) at different pH values (pH 3.0, 7.0, and 10) in the presence of Pt-loaded TiO2 UV100, the amount of H2 evolved is almost twice as high as the expected value calculated from the sum of all detected methanol photooxidation products (formaldehyde, formic acid, and carbon dioxide). To examine only the initial photooxidation step of methanol, the experiments were repeated at shorter UV–Vis illumination times (15min) working again at different pH values (pH 3.0 and 7.0). Under these conditions, only formaldehyde was detected and its amount was found to be equimolar to the amount of H2 evolved. The same results were obtained when the photooxidation products were measured at high methanol concentration (4.93M, 3.7×105 μmol methanol, see Table 1)."
9,Discussion,
10,The antenna mechanism,"4.1 The antenna mechanism Pt-loaded TiO2 UV100 exhibits higher photocatalytic activity for the H2 evolution from aqueous methanol solution than Pt-loaded TiO2 P25 and Pt-loaded TiO2 P25HT, respectively (cf. Fig. 1). This higher photocatalytic activity of H2 formation can be explained, at the first sight, by the fact that the surface area of TiO2 UV100 is about six times larger than that of TiO2 P25 and twice as large as that of TiO2 P25HT (cf. Table S1). However, the observed differences in photocatalytic activity, in general, cannot be interpreted using only one single property of the photocatalysts [27]. In fact, the photocatalytic activity depends on various properties, e.g., surface area, crystallinity, particle size, optical properties, structure, nature of exposed crystal faces, charge recombination rate constants as well as upon many other factors. For example, the rates of the photocatalytic H2 evolution over Pt-loaded TiO2 UV100 and Pt-loaded TiO2 P25HT were found to be 303 and 252μmolh−1, respectively, while their BET surface areas are 293 and 169m2 g−1, respectively. Though Pt-loaded TiO2 UV100 has a significantly higher BET surface area than Pt-loaded TiO2 P25HT, it does not exhibit a much higher photocatalytic activity. On the other hand, the significantly higher photocatalytic activity of both, TiO2 UV100 and TiO2 P25HT, as compared with TiO2 P25 can not only be explained by the fact that the latter has a lower BET surface area but also by the differences in structure and phase composition. TiO2 UV100 and TiO2 P25HT exhibit a mesoporous structure as proved by the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (see supplementary data Figs. S5A and B, respectively), whereas TiO2 P25 is completely non-porous (see supplementary data Fig. S5C). This mesoporous structure may either result from compactly packed nanoparticles or may be due to the agglomeration of the TiO2 nanoparticles. This mesoporous structure can then provide suitable interfaces for facile interparticle charge transfer while the reactants can freely diffuse through the pores as illustrated in Fig. 3 [3,28]. While the excited TiO2 nanoparticle can transfer the absorbed energy through the mesoporous TiO2 network to other ground-state TiO2 particles, the probability of the hole trapping at an hydroxyl surface group forming an adsorbed hydroxyl radical that is subsequently transferred to an adsorbed CH3OH molecule is considered to be high. Consequently, the probability of electron transfer to the Pt particle is increased by an increased CH3OH diffusion through the pores of the nanostructures. It is therefore suggested that the so-called antenna mechanism [22,29,30] together with an increased CH3OH diffusion can be employed to explain the higher photocatalytic H2 evolution over Pt-loaded TiO2 UV100 and Pt-loaded TiO2 P25HT. Within this antenna model, it can be imagined that the overlap of the energy bands of the TiO2 nanoparticles forming this network will result in unified energy bands for the entire system enabling a quasi-free movement of the photogenerated charge carriers throughout the mesoporous structure. Consequently, an electron generated by light absorption within one of the nanoparticles forming the network will subsequently be available to promote redox processes anywhere within the structure. To verify the importance of this proposed antenna mechanism, the ratio of Pt islands to TiO2 nanoparticles has been calculated. Assuming Pt nanoparticles are spherical and have a diameter of 3.0nm (cf. Fig. S6, supplementary data), the volume of one 3.0nm Pt nanoparticle is calculated to be 1.41×10−20 cm3. Considering the mass density of Pt (21.4gcm−3), the average weight of one Pt nanoparticle is derived to be approximately 3.02×10−19 g. Therefore, the number of Pt islands for each gram of 0.5wt% Pt-loaded TiO2 will be 1.65×1016. Assuming spherical TiO2 nanoparticles with 10nm average diameter (see Table 1) and a mass density of 3.9gcm−3, the number of TiO2 nanoparticles per gram is calculated to be 4.91×1017. Thus, the ratio of Pt islands to TiO2 nanoparticles should be between 1 and 30. This emphasizes the importance of the transfer of the photogenerated electrons throughout the mesoporous structure. Furthermore, the phase composition might also affect the photocatalytic activity of H2 evolution. TiO2 UV100 and TiO2 P25HT consist of pure anatase phase (cf. Table S1), whereas TiO2 P25 is a mixture of anatase and rutile (82% anatase and 18% rutile). The flatband potential of the rutile phase coincides almost exactly with the redox potential of H+/H2 vs. NHE, whereas that of anatase is shifted cathodically by approximately 200mV [31,32]. In the latter case, a considerable driving force for the proton reduction is available, while in the case of rutile this driving force will be very small. This can also explain why TiO2 UV100 and TiO2 P25HT are more active than TiO2 P25."
11,The light intensity dependency,"4.2 The light intensity dependency Fig. 2 indicates that at low light intensity (4.40μeinsteinmin−1) the rate of H2 evolution over Pt-loaded TiO2 P25 is similar to that observed for Pt-loaded TiO2 UV100 and TiO2 P25HT, whereas, at higher light intensity (44.87μeinsteinmin−1) the rate of H2 evolution over the latter materials is about four times higher than that measured for Pt-loaded TiO2 P25. Apparently, it is extremely important to consider the effect of light intensity when comparing different photocatalysts. A possible explanation for these differences is that the e−/h+ recombination rate constant is higher for Pt-loaded TiO2 P25 leading to the fact that this undesired reaction channel becomes more significant at high light intensity in case of Pt-loaded TiO2 P25 as compared with Pt-loaded TiO2 UV100 and Pt-loaded TiO2 P25HT. It is well known that the rates of photocatalytic reactions strongly depend on both the concentration of organic compound used as test molecule and the intensity of the incident light. This behavior is usually described by an empirical kinetic expression, i.e., the so-called Langmuir–Hinshelwood rate law (Eq. (1)) [33–35]. (1) R = k r K c 1 + K c η ( I 0 ) β where the kinetic parameters k r and K are assumed to be independent from the incident light intensity I 0, with β =1 at low values of I 0, and β =0.5 at higher I 0 values. β is an empirical constant related to the ratio between interfacial charge transfer and recombination of the charge carriers. Combining the definition of the initial photonic efficiency ζ 0, i.e., the ratio between the initial H2 production rate and the incident flux of photons I 0, with Eq. (1) for the initial concentration c = c 0 yields (2) ζ 0 = k r K c 0 1 + K c 0 η ( I 0 ) β − 1 (3) log ( ζ 0 ) = log k r K c 0 1 + K c 0 η + ( β − 1 ) log ( I 0 ) Eq. (2) predicts that the initial photonic efficiency ζ 0 should depend on the initial concentration of the degraded molecule c 0 as well as on the incident photon flux I 0. High concentrations of methanol were employed during the rate measurements and kept constant to ensure that the measured rate is uneffected by the methanol concentration. Plotting log(I 0) vs. log(ζ 0) indicates a linear relation as shown in Fig. S7 (see supplementary data). According to Eq. (3), the values of β were calculated from the slopes obtained by linear regression and estimated to be 0.84, 0.83, and 0.29 for Pt-loaded TiO2 UV100, Pt-loaded TiO2 P25HT and Pt-loaded TiO2 P25, respectively. A β value of 0.5 was observed in many systems as concluded from the linear dependence between the square root of the absorbed light intensity and the quantum efficiency [19,33,36–38]. Since β is an empirical constant related to the ratio between interfacial charge transfer and recombination of the charge carriers, it is very likely that the β value differs from one photocatalyst to another as experimentally found in the present study."
12,The methanol oxidation mechanism,"4.3 The methanol oxidation mechanism According to the literature [8,12,13,19,39,40] and depending on the detected products of the photocatalytic methanol oxidation, it is concluded that methanol is photooxidized to carbon dioxide via the formation of the stable intermediates formaldehyde and formic acid (Eqs. (4)–(7)). The individual reaction steps are summarized elsewhere [20]. (4) C H 3 OH ⟶ h ν , Pt @ TiO 2 CH 2 O + H 2 (5) C H 2 O + H 2 O → CH 2 ( OH ) 2 (6) C H 2 ( OH ) 2 ⟶ h ν , Pt @ TiO 2 HCOOH + H 2 (7) HCOOH ⟶ h ν , Pt @ TiO 2 CO 2 + H 2 The e−/h+ pairs photogenerated in the TiO2 particles upon photoexcitation will migrate to their surfaces where these redox reactions take place. The photogenerated electron will be trapped at the Pt islands followed by the reduction of a proton from water or/and from methanol producing adsorbed H radicals. On the oxidative side, the photogenerated holes will either react with surface Ti–OH groups producing trapped holes or with adsorbed water molecules producing adsorbed OH radicals or they will be transferred directly to adsorbed methanol molecules. However, the present study does not enable any differentiation between these pathways. The methanol photooxidation through the OH pathway has been suggested to occur on bare titanium dioxide surfaces [12,13,19,39,40]. Regardless of which oxidation pathway is more likely, the only expected product of these reaction pathways are CH2OH and CH3O• formed by hydrogen abstraction from the carbon atom and from the –OH group of CH3OH, respectively. Asmus et al. [41] showed that in homogeneous aqueous solutions the efficiency of the reaction of OH radicals with CH3OH by hydrogen abstraction from the carbon atom is 93%. The remaining 7% is accounted for by the formation of methoxy radicals CH3O. Methoxy radicals are subsequently reacting with methanol producing CH2OH [42]. In the absence of O2, the only way to form HCHO from CH2OH is via electron injection either into the conduction band of TiO2 or directly into the Pt islands since this radical has a reduction potential more negative than that of the conduction band of TiO2 [8]. This dark process is referred to as “current-doubling” in photoelectro-chemistry and has been observed in many related systems including the photoanodic oxidation of alcohols on TiO2 electrodes [43–46]. The injected electron from CH2OH allows, in principle, the H2 formation even after the absorption of just one photon. These proposed steps for the photocatalytic H2 evolution from aqueous methanol solutions over platinized TiO2 are schematically summarized in Fig. 4 . HCHO can be further oxidized in an analogous manner producing HCOOH and finally CO2 [47–51]. The quantitative analysis of the photocatalytic methanol oxidation products following 3h of illumination employing 0.03M aqueous methanol solution (2.25mmol methanol) indicates that the yield of H2 production is three times higher than the amount of HCHO formed even at different pH values (3.0, 7.0, and 10) (see Table 1). Moreover, the molar ratio of the evolved H2 is about 2.0 times higher than the value calculated from the sum of all CH3OH oxidation products. Assuming that HCHO, HCOOH, and CO2 are the only products of the photocatalytic methanol oxidation, the sum of their concentrations should be equivalent to the concentration of evolved H2. Since this is not observed here it has to be assumed that there are undetected products, e.g., carbonate and bicarbonate due to the high solubility of CO2 in water. In an attempt to minimize the amount of secondary and tertiary photooxidation reaction of CH3OH, the overall balance was tested after a short illumination time (15min instead of 3h). In this case, only HCHO was detected and the amount of evolved H2 matches well the amount of HCHO formed even at different methanol concentrations and different pH values, e.g., 3.0 and 7.0 (see Table 1). Unfortunately, the exact source of the protons yielding H2 cannot be determined from the present study, i.e., it is unclear whether H+ originates from water or from CH3OH. However, these results clearly indicate that methanol acts as the only hole scavenger resulting in equimolar H2 production."
13,Conclusions,"The photocatalytic H2 production from aqueous methanol solutions over Pt-loaded commercial and home made TiO2 photocatalysts has been extensively studied. The difference in the activity between the investigated photocatalysts is discussed depending on the physical properties, e.g., BET surface area, structure, and phase composition. The applied light intensity is shown to strongly affect the H2 production rate depending on the e−/h+ recombination rate constant of the investigated photocatalyst. Following 3h of illumination, the yield of H2 evolved is found to be about 2.0 times higher than the value calculated from the sum of all photocatalytic methanol oxidation products (formaldehyde, formic acid, and carbon dioxide). This difference can only be explained by the presence of undetected products, e.g., carbonate and bicarbonate due to the high solubility of carbon dioxide in water. Following 15min of illumination, only formaldehyde is detected and the amount of evolved H2 matches very well the amount of formaldehyde formed even at different pH values and employing different methanol concentrations. These results clearly indicate that methanol acts as the only hole scavenger resulting in equimolar H2 production. Hence, it seems more likely that this system should be described as a methanol dehydrogenation reaction when it is stopped at the first step of photocatalytic methanol oxidation (formaldehyde formation) or as a photocatalytic methanol reforming when carbon dioxide is detected but not as a real water splitting system. It is also important to mention that no O2 was detected at any of the different applied conditions."
