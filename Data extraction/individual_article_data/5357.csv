0,Introduction,"The increased energy demand as well as the concerns about diminishing petroleum resources and the associated environmental issues, have sparked increasing interest in the use of biomass as a replacement for fossil fuel resources [1–3]. Lignocellulosic biomass in particular, has been studied because it is a renewable resource that can be used to produce fuels and chemicals which are currently derived mainly from petroleum [4]. In order to be used as a fuel, lignocellulosic biomass needs to undergo a conversion process for energy-content densification due to its low volumetric energy content. Pyrolysis converts solid biomass in an oxygen deficient environment at 400–800°C, producing pyrolysis oil at a high yield up to 75% [5]. However, pyrolysis oils have much higher oxygen contents than petroleum, in the form of water and oxygen-containing functional groups, which result in an elemental composition similar to that of biomass from which they were derived [6,7]. The oxygenated functional groups (mainly hydroxyaldehydes, hydroxyketones, carboxylic acids, sugars, levoglucosan and phenolics, etc.) make pyrolysis oil chemically unstable [8,9]. Lu et al. [10] concluded that aldehydes are the most unstable components in a bio-oil since they can react with many different types of chemicals including water, phenolics, and alcohols to form condensed products. The lack of chemical stability predominantly expresses itself through self-polymerization during storage and downstream processing [11]. Self-polymerization of pyrolysis oil during processing is highly undesirable, as it can lead to reactor clogging and catalyst deactivation [12,13]. The high oxygen content of a pyrolysis oil lead to lower calorific values of the oil (LHV=14–18MJ/kg) which is approximately that of the original biomass and only 1/3–1/2 of those of conventional hydrocarbon fuels [14]. It also makes pyrolysis oil immiscible with conventional hydrocarbon fuels [15]. Thus, the undesirable properties of pyrolysis oils mainly due to high oxygen content: highly viscous, thermally instable and corrosive, present a great challenge in the use of bio-oils as a substitute for fossil-derived fuels [16,17]. Further processing or upgrading of the oil is necessary. Pyrolysis oil upgrading reduces the oxygen content of the oil, thereby improving its miscibility with petroleum fractions [18]. Upgraded pyrolysis oil can therefore be blended with a conventional petroleum fraction (e.g. vacuum gas oil) for co-refining (e.g. via FCC) to produce transportation fuels. Although pyrolysis oils can be upgraded by thermal or catalytic cracking, this process is accompanied by significant (up to 40wt%) coke production [19], and deep removal of oxygen to below 10wt% is very difficult [20]. Catalytic hydroprocessing or hydrotreatment of pyrolysis oil is a more promising alternative [18,21,22]. In this process, pyrolysis oil is reacted with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst to produce a hydrogenated and deoxygenated oil product with improved physical and chemical properties. The well-known catalysts for hydrotreatment of pyrolysis oil are conventional hydrodesulfurization catalysts such as sulfided NiMo/Al2O3, CoMo/Al2O3, and NiMo/Al2O3–SiO2 [15,23,24]. Non-sulfided transition metal catalysts, e.g. MoNi/γ-Al2O3 (reduced prior to reaction) and NiCu/δ-Al2O3, have also been tested for the catalytic hydrotreatment of pyrolysis oil, but to a far lesser extent [25,26]. Noble metal-based catalysts, which are better known as hydrogenation catalysts, have also been evaluated as substitutes for sulfided catalysts. Examples of this include: Pd on zeolite carriers [27], Pd on mesoporous CeO2 and ZrO2 [28], and Rh on zirconia [29]. The use of carbon-supported catalysts (e.g. Ru/C) has been widely explored [5,30,31]. Wildschut et al. [14] compared noble metal catalysts (Ru/C, Ru/TiO2, Ru/Al2O3, Pt/C and Pd/C) and typical hydrotreatment catalysts (sulfided NiMo/Al2O3 and CoMo/Al2O3), and they found that Ru/C catalyst exhibited superior oil yields (up to 60wt%) and the greatest extent of deoxygenation (up to 90wt%) as compared to the classical hydrotreatment catalysts. One approach to limit the extent of coking during pyrolysis oil upgrading is to stabilize the oil prior to hydroprocessing. As mentioned previously, the condensation reactions that produce coke are the reactions of compounds containing hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups. Thus the stabilization of a pyrolysis oil requires the removal of these reactive functional groups. Carbohydrates in a fast pyrolysis oil comprise some of the reactive constituents that are responsible for molecular weight increase (through polymerization) of fast pyrolysis oil during hydrolysis, hydrotreating, steam reforming or high pressure thermal treatment [32–37]. Carboxylic acids are amongst the most reactive components found in fast pyrolysis oil and stabilization of pyrolysis oil with an alcohol (via esterification) has been described as a promising route to reduce the reactivity of fast pyrolysis oil [38–40]. Increased stability of the pyrolysis oil reduces the likelihood of self-polymerization both during storage and during processing. Since self-polymerization and hydro-de-oxygenation (HDO) reactions could co-occur during hydrotreatment, increased pyrolysis oil stability can increase the selectivity of the HDO reactions [41,42]. In our previous study [43], glycerol at a relatively high concentration was used to stabilize a fast pyrolysis oil via catalytic esterification pretreatment, followed by upgrading the stabilized fast pyrolysis oil via hydrotreatment or thermal treatment. In the stabilization process in our previous work, a large amount of alcohol (at 50wt% loading with respect to (w.r.t.) the mass of pyrolysis oil) was used, where the diluting or free radical-scavenging effects of the alcohols in the reaction system were believed to play a major role in retarding the self-polymerization of the reaction intermediates during the upgrading process for the stabilized oil [43]. Aiming to reduce the amount of alcohol use and hence improve the process economy, effects of stabilizing fast pyrolysis oil with a small loading (5wt% w.r.t. bio-oil) of various alcohol, including methanol, ethanol or glycerol, on the subsequent hydrotreatment of the oil were investigated in this study."
1,Materials and methods,"The hardwood sawdust fast pyrolysis oil (PO) used in this study was obtained from BTG Biomass Technology Group. It has a water content of 28wt% and an HHV of 22.3MJ/kg (on a dry basis). Amberlyst-35 DRY (Rohm and Haas) was used without any pretreatment. Ru/C catalyst was purchased from Sigma/Aldrich, with 5wt% Ru loading, and used as received. ACS reagent grade methanol, ethanol and glycerol were purchased from Caledon. Fig. 1 illustrates schematic diagram of the experimental setup. It is a semi-batch reactor designed for continuously supplying hydrogen into a stirred autoclave batch reactor while maintaining the pressure of reactor at a desired level. A stirred autoclave reactor was used for both fast pyrolysis oil stabilization and hydrotreatment of the stabilized oil. The reactor is made of nickel alloy and has a nominal internal volume of 500mL (Parr Instrument Company). To produce an alcohol-stabilized pyrolysis oil, denoted as MPO (methanol-stabilized PO), EPO (ethanol-stabilized PO) and GPO (glycerol-stabilized PO), respectively, typically 275g of wet PO and 13.75g the respective alcohol (5wt% loading w.r.t. to the mass of wet PO) were loaded into the autoclave. Amberlyst-35 DRY at a loading of 3wt% (w.r.t. the wet liquid mixture of PO and the alcohol) was added to the reactor. For comparison, NPO (non-alcohol-stabilized PO) was produced by processing PO in the presence of Amberlyst-35 DRY (3wt%, w.r.t. the wet PO) without alcohol. The autoclave reactor was then sealed for and leak proof testing using 20bar nitrogen for 20min. After ensuring leak proof of the reactor, it was flushed twice with 20bar nitrogen to remove any residual air and filled with 2bar nitrogen. The stirrer speed was set at 360rpm and reactor was heated to 100°C at an approximate rate of 2°C/min. Retention time of the reaction was fixed 2h including the heating time. After 2h, the heater was switched off and a cold water bath was used to quench the reactor to room temperature. Gaseous products were collected in a gas bag for analysis by GC-TCD prior to collection of the liquid product. The reaction mixture was stirred at 180rpm during gas collection to promote release of some dissolved gas (such as CO2) in the liquid product. Very small gas yields were obtained due to the low reaction temperature, therefore analysis of the gases evolved during the stabilization was not reported in this paper. No phase separation of the reaction mixture was observed. The spent catalyst was separated from the liquid product by centrifuge at 4500rpm for 30min. As shown in Fig. 1, high-pressure hydrogen gas was supplied into the autoclave reactor from a supply vessel (Swagelok, nominal volume of 300mL) whose pressure and temperature were monitored by a PC. The recorded data was used to calculate the hydrogen consumption for each test. In a typical hydrotreatment run, 150g of the stabilized wet feed was loaded into the autoclave reactor and 5g Ru/C catalyst at a loading of 3.33wt% (w.r.t. wet feed) was added to the feed. The reactor was sealed and stirred at 360rpm for pre-mixing, and was then subject to leak proof testing using 150bar hydrogen for 20min. If leak proof of the reactor was confirmed, the hydrogen inside was vented from the reactor, and the residual air was completely removed from the reactor, supply vessel and the entire inlet gas lines using a vacuum pump. Admittedly, in these vacuuming-purging cycles some high volatiles of the pyrolysis oil could be lost by evaporation. Nevertheless, the amount of the high volatiles in the pyrolysis oil is believed to be low and can be neglected in this work. All hydrotreatment runs were performed at 300°C on various feeds, i.e., PO, MPO, EPO, GPO and NPO, respectively. These hydrotreatment tests were first operated in a batch mode for 1h including the heating time with 100bar hydrogen (initial pressure) charged from the supply vessel pre-filled with up to ∼250bar hydrogen. After the reactor was filled with 100bar hydrogen, it (in batch mode with V2 and V1 valves closed) was heated to 300°C at ∼12°C/min. During this time, the supply vessel was refilled to ∼250bar H2. After 1h, R1 was set to 150bar and V1 was opened to increase the pressure of lines to 150bar. Afterwards, V2 was opened and the hydrogen pressure inside the reactor was increased to 150bar. The hydrogen pressure was maintained at constant pressure of 150bar for the subsequent 2h (V2 and V1 valves open) to continuously compensate for the hydrogen consumed during the hydrotreatment reaction. After an overall retention time of 3h, V2 and V1 valves were closed, the heater was switched off, and the autoclave reactor was cooled by running cold water into the reactor’s internal cooling coils for 30min under stirring. After the temperature of autoclave reactor reached ∼75°C, the reactor was immersed in an ice-water bath to further quench it to room temperature. After cooling, the gaseous products inside the reactor were collected into a gas bag while remaining the stirring at 180rpm to facilitate release of any dissolved gas in the reactor mixture. After the gases were collected, the liquid product and spent catalyst were decanted from the reactor. Phase separation was now observed in the liquid product. To improve phase separation, the liquid product was transferred into centrifuge vials and centrifuged for 30min and 4500rpm. Afterwards, two phases were obtained: a heavier organic phase (oil fraction, OF) containing the spent catalyst (recovered by filtration), and an aqueous phase (aqueous fraction; AF) which contained water and hydrophilic products. Due to the unavoidable loss of the solid particles upon the recovery operations, in most cases the recovered spent catalyst after drying was even less than the amount of the fresh catalyst (i.e., 5g) added into the reactor before the HDO treatment. Thus, the amount of coke formation or carbon deposit over the Ru/C catalyst is considered negligibly small. Elemental composition and water content analyses of the oil and aqueous fractions were performed on a CHNS-O analyzer (Thermo Electron Corporation, Flash-EA-1112 series) and a volumetric Karl Fischer titrator (Mettler Toledo V20), respectively. The residual alcohol contents in the alcohol stabilized feeds were measured by GC-FID (Gentech GC-2010). The molecular weights and distribution of the feeds and the hydrotreated oil products were analyzed on a Waters Breeze GPC–HPLC (gel permeation chromatography–high performance liquid chromatography) instrument (1525 binary pump, UV detector at 270nm; Waters Styrylgel HR1 column at a column temperature of 40°C) using THF as the eluant at a flow rate of 1mL/min. Gas composition of the gas products collected from the tests was measured by GC-TCD (Agilent Micro-GC 3000)."
2,Results and discussion,
3,PO stabilization,"3.1 PO stabilization The elemental composition, water content and high heating value (HHV) of the PO, mixtures of PO and various alcohols and alcohol-stabilized PO’s are shown in Table 1 . The elemental compositions of the PO and mixtures of the PO with various alcohols and various alcohol-stabilized PO’s are similar either on wet-and-residual-alcohol-included basis or on water-and-residual-alcohol free basis. Thus, the alcohol stabilization treatment of PO with a small amount of alcohol loading (5wt% w.r.t. PO) did not alter the elemental composition of the PO. While methanol and ethanol conversions were almost the same on mole basis, the molar conversion of glycerol was higher than that of methanol and ethanol, indicating that higher reactivity of glycerol in catalytic esterification of the PO likely due to glycerol’s multiple hydroxyl functional group. Fig. 2 shows molecular weight distributions of the original PO feed and the stabilized POs with various alcohols. The figure relates the weight fraction W (log M) vs. molecular weight (M), obtained in a method as described elsewhere [45]. Compared with the original PO feed, all stabilized feeds with or without alcohol show obviously lower molecular weights, suggesting that the stabilization pretreatment of PO over a solid acid with or without alcohol could effectively reduce the molecular weight of the feed. The reduction in molecular weight of the PO feed during the stabilization treatment might be owing to both esterification reactions that convert carboxylic groups into esters and the solid acid catalyzed dehydration reactions that removes hydroxyl groups of the oil, hence lowering the inter-molecular aggregation forces in the oil (mainly caused by hydrogen bonds) [43]. When an alcohol was used, the solvent dilution “spacing” effects might also contribute to the lowering of the inter-molecular aggregation forces, leading to reduced molar mass of the pre-treated oil."
4,Hydrotreatment of alcohol-stabilized PO,"3.2 Hydrotreatment of alcohol-stabilized PO Table 2 shows the properties of oil fractions (OFs) produced via the hydrotreatment of PO, MPO, EPO, GPO and NPO at 300°C and 150bar H2 in semi-batch mode operation. The residual alcohol contents in the feeds and in the obtained oil fractions and aqueous fractions are also shown in the Table. Since the water content of the oil fractions was found to be within the error range of the volumetric Karl Fischer titrator used for this study, the oil fractions were considered water-free. As shown in Table 2, the elemental composition of the hydrotreated oil fractions from all feeds is very similar, irrespective of whether or not it was catalytically treated with an alcohol. As also shown in the Table, alcohol consumption during the hydrotreament of any an alcohol-stabilized PO was much low (normally <10–15%), and the residual alcohol in the feed was retained almost completely in the aqueous and oil fractions. During the hydrotreatment of the alcohol-stabilized PO feeds (MPO, EPO and GPO), consumption of the residual methanol or ethanol, likely through steam gasification/reforming reaction to form CO/CO2 and H2, appeared to be more than that of glycerol, which could be explained by the relatively lower reactivity of glycerol than methanol and ethanol. Fig. 3 is the Van Krevelen plot comparing the hydrogen and oxygen contents of feeds with those of the oil fractions obtained from 300°C hydrotreatment of various PO feeds with and without alcohol stabilization. It shall be noted that Van-Krevelen plot data the point of GPO feed does not seem to be plausible (with a similar O/C value as the other feeds, but a much higher H/C, while glycerol has a lower H/C than methanol and ethanol). Thus, the elemental analysis of the GPO feed might be questionable. Unfortunately no GPO sample was remained, hence redoing of the element analysis on this sample is not possible. To draw the attention of the readers to its possible mistake in the elemental analysis on the GPO feed, the data point is shown with a question mark in Fig. 3. From Fig. 3, it is clear that although differing much in the composition of the different feeds, the composition (either O/C or H/C) of the hydrotreated oil fractions is similar, although the EPO-derived hydrotreated oil fraction has slightly higher H/C value than the other oil fractions. Fig. 4 presents the hydrogen consumption and CO2 production during hydrotreatment of various feeds at 300°C. It shows that H2 consumption is generally higher from hydrotreatment of various alcohol-stabilized PO feeds than that from the original or non-alcohol pretreated PO, suggesting enhanced HDO or hydro-cracking reactions with the alcohol-stabilized PO feeds. The hydrogen consumption was the highest with the ethanol-stabilized feed (EPO) which is in good agreement with the highest H/C molar ration for the oil fraction derived from EPO (Fig. 3). On the other hand, that CO2 formation from hydrotreatment of all alcohol-stabilized PO feeds is consistently lower than that from the original or non-alcohol pretreated PO. The reduced CO2 production from alcohol-stabilized PO feeds suggest less decarboxylation during hydrotreatment of these alcohol-esterified feeds. Reduction in decarboxylation reaction or reduction in CO2 formation was likely due to a decrease in the carboxylic acids content of the PO by esterification reactions between the carboxylic acids and an alcohol in the stabilization treatment [43,37]. Fig. 5 shows molecular weight distributions of the 300°C hydrotreated oil fractions (OF) from various feeds with or without alcohol stabilization treatment. As shown in the figure, alcohol stabilization treatment of the PO feed (even at a small alcohol loading) could produce oil products with reduced molecular weights during the hydrotreatment at 300°C, compared with the oil products from the non-stabilized feeds (PO and NPO). Thus it can be concluded that esterification of the feed with a small amount of alcohol, together with the presence of a low content of residual alcohol in the alcohol-stabilized feed as a solvent or radical-scavenger, could prevent self-polymerization and decrease the overall molecular weight of the hydrotreated oil products [45,46]. Fig. 6 shows mass and carbon balance closures (on dry-and-residual-alcohol free basis) obtained in hydrotreatment of the various feeds at 300°C. In all tests, the overall mass and carbon balances are in the reasonable ranges of 85–90wt% and 105–110wt%, respectively. In all tests, the oil fraction contains the greatest mass or carbon contents indicating good energy recovery into the oil product during bio-oil hydrotreatment, which is highly desirable. The carbon content of the aqueous fraction (AF) of MPO, EPO or GPO (11–15wt% C) is slightly higher than that of PO or NPO (approx. 9wt% C), suggesting that presence of more hydrophilic compounds. However, alcohol stabilization treatment of the PO feed did not significantly affect the mass or carbon distribution in the products during the 300°C hydrotreatment. The effects of PO stabilization on its subsequent hydrotreatment were further examined at a higher temperature and pressure, i.e., 350°C and in semi-batch mode with 200bar H2 for 3h using MPO and PO as the feeds comparatively. The amount of CO2 produced in hydrotreatment of MPO at 350°C was significantly greater than that from the PO hydrotreatment at the same temperature. Methanol conversion at 350°C was measured also higher than that at 300°C, suggesting the increase in CO2 formation might partially from methanol conversion. Increasing the hydrotreatment temperature from 300°C to 350°C resulted in reduction of the residual methanol content in the MPO-derived hydrotreated oil fraction, likely due to the enhanced gasification reaction of methanol to form more CO2 at a higher temperature. Increase in hydrotreatment temperature promoted oxygen removal too, and increased the carbon content of the oil fraction, hence producing an oil fraction with much higher HHV (36–37MJ/kg at 350°C vs. 32–33MJ/kg at 300°C, calculated using the Milne formula). Thus, esterification–stabilization of bio-oil with a small alcohol loading had significant effects on the subsequent hydrotreatment upgrading with respect to the heating values of the hydrotreated oil products. As expected, the 350°C – hydrotreatment produced oil fractions of a lower molar mass due to the promoted hydrocracking reactions at a higher temperature (Fig. 7 ). As shown in both Figs. 5 and 7, the alcohol stabilization treatment of the feed could effectively prevent self-polymerization and decrease the overall molecular weight of the hydrotreated oil products at 300°C. Whereas, at 350°C the effect of alcohol stabilization treatment of the feed on the molecular weight of the hydrotreated oil products was negligible, suggesting that in hydrotreatment at a higher temperature, the reaction temperature plays a more prominent role in determining the overall molecular weight of the hydrotreated oil products. Fig. 8 shows the mass and carbon distributions in the hydrotreatment products from PO and MPO feeds at 300°C and 350°C. Again, the results show that the alcohol stabilization treatment of the PO feed with a small alcohol loading (5wt% w.r.t. PO) had insignificant effects on mass and carbon distributions in the hydrotreatment products at both 300°C and 350°C."
5,Conclusions,"In this study, effects of esterification pre-treatment of fast pyrolysis oil using alcohol at a small loading on the subsequent hydrotreatment of the oil were investigated experimentally, from which the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) The reduction in molecular weight of the PO feed during the stabilization treatment might be owing to both esterification reactions that convert carboxylic groups into esters and the solid acid catalyzed dehydration reactions that removes hydroxyl groups of the oil, hence lowering the inter-molecular aggregation forces in the oil. When an alcohol was used, the solvent dilution “spacing” effects might also contribute to the lowering of the inter-molecular aggregation forces, leading to reduced molar mass of the pre-treated oil. (2) Alcohol stabilization of the PO feed did not significantly affect the mass or carbon distribution in the products during the 300°C hydrotreatment. The elemental composition (and O/C molar ratio) of the hydrotreated oil fractions from all feeds is very similar, irrespective of whether or not it was catalytically treated with an alcohol. (3) There is appreciable difference in H/C between the hydrotreated oil fractions from different alcohol-stabilized PO feeds, and the EPO-derived hydrotreated oil fraction has slightly higher H/C value than the other oil fractions. H2 consumption is generally higher from hydrotreatment of various alcohol-stabilized PO feeds than that from the original or non-alcohol pretreated PO, suggesting enhanced HDO or hydro-cracking reactions with the alcohol-stabilized PO feeds. (4) Esterification of the feed with a small amount of alcohol, together with the presence of a low content of residual alcohol in the alcohol-stabilized feed as a solvent or radical-scavenger, could prevent self-polymerization and decrease the overall molecular weight of the hydrotreated oil products. (5) In higher-temperature hydrotreatment (i.e., at 350°C), the reaction temperature was found to play a more prominent role than the alcohol-stabilization of the feed, in determining the overall molecular weight of the hydrotreated oil products and the mass and carbon distributions in the hydrotreatment products."
