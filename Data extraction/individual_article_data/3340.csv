0,Introduction,"The production of bio-fuel from non-edible oils is an important global issue to mitigate global warming and to secure alternatives to fossil-based fuels [1,2]. Herein, Bio-diesel, fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), produced by catalytic transesterification reaction of oils and renewable hydrocarbons yielded by hydrotreating of oils in NExBTL [3,4] and Ecofining [5] processes are well-known bio-fuels. Even so, many studies have been still carried out to improve the fuel properties of FAME (heterogeneous catalyst, blending and deoxygenation) and to secure economic feasibility of hydrotreated fuels (pretreatment, unsulfied catalyst and hydrogen usage) [6–8]. Recently, aviation fuel has received considerable attention due to the reports that the aviation accounts for approximately 12% of carbon emissions from all transport sectors [9] and jet fuel usage and world market will increase gradually for the next thirty years [10]. These have encouraged studies on the production of bio-jet fuel to mitigate transboundary air pollution originated from a long-distance transportation [11–13]. Generally, bio-jet fuel is produced from non-edible oils via previously mentioned commercial processes, where oils are hydro-deoxygenated and hydro-isomerized/cracked with hydrotreating catalysts and then distillated in sequence. However, a great amount of hydrogen is required to remove the oxygen in the molecules of oils (300–420m3 of H2/m3 of vegetable oil) [14]. For minimization of hydrogen consumption, decarboxylation reaction of oils has been studied to take oxygen out of the oil molecules as CO2 gas, instead of hydro-deoxygenation [15]. As shown in Fig.1 (a), one mole of triglyceride (TG) converts into propane and free fatty acids (FFAs) in the presence of three moles of hydrogen. Oxy-free hydrocarbons can be produced from FFAs via catalytic decarboxylation reaction without hydrogen supply. 5wt.% Pd catalyst supported on activated carbon, screened by Murzin group, was founded the representative catalyst for this reaction [16]. However, significant catalyst deactivation is inevitable in the environment of no hydrogen and it is difficult to regenerate the used catalyst because activated carbon is used for support. Lamb and co-workers [17] reported that Pd[5]/C stability during decarboxylation reaction could be enhanced by addition of 10% H2 and then by preventing the formation of unsaturated hydrocarbon products. More recently, deoxygenation reaction of TG over Pd[5]/C or Pt[5]/C catalysts aided by in-situ produced hydrogen has been studied, instead of external hydrogen supply [18–20]. As shown in Fig.1(b), theoretically, TG is hydrolyzed into three moles of FFA and one mole of glycerol, where glycerol is used as an in-situ hydrogen source. Glycerol reforming makes seven moles of hydrogen and the in-situ produced hydrogen is used for pre-hydrogenation of unsaturated FFAs into saturated FFAs. The hydrogenated FFAs are easily deoxygenated to oxy-free hydrocarbons. Vardon et al. [19] performed the coupled hydrothermal hydrogenation and deoxygenation of model FFA using Pt[5.2]–Re[4.2]/C catalyst while employing the hydrogen generated in situ from glycerol. However, they found that the loading of hydrogen in the batch reactor at the initial stage was necessary to complete the conversion of FFAs into desirable hydrocarbons. Hollak et al. [20] examined the hydrothermal deoxygenation of TGs and FFAs over Pd[5]/C catalyst while using hydrogen produced in situ from glycerol. However, the main hydrocarbon products were long-chain olefins even though the hydrogen produced in situ had a positive effect on the deoxygenation activity. Furthermore, additional external hydrogen sources such as glycerol and methanol were needed to obtain more saturated hydrocarbons, since the conversion rate of glycerol using Pd/C catalyst was relatively low, in spite of the long reaction time (20h). Recently, the direct formic acid fuel cell has been developed for portable power applications, where formic acid is a promising alternative fuel because it can produce hydrogen at relatively low temperatures over Pd/C catalyst (HCOOH→CO2 +H2) [21]. Therefore, in the present study, formic acid was applied for catalytic deoxygenation reaction, as not only a co-reactant but also a hydrogen donor. We conducted the catalytic decarboxylation reaction of crude Jatropha oil (CJO) over Pd/C catalyst to produce oxy-free hydrocarbons, assisted with hydrogen in-situ produced from formic acid solution (30%). Deoxygenation reactions of CJO according to variables were investigated to describe the addition effect of formic acid solution on the degree of deoxygenation and product distribution."
1,Methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials CJO was supplied from Dr. Rajeev K. Sukumaran (India). Distilled water (D.W.) was produced by using μPure water purification system (Human Co. Ltd.) and formic acid (⩾85.0%) was employed from OCI Company Ltd. N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoro-acetamide (BSTFA, ⩾98.0%) and pyridine (⩾99.0%) were purchased from Acros Organic and Samchun Chemicals, respectively, to analyze liquid products at gas chromatography (GC, Shimadzu GC2010 plus). Ethyl acetate (⩾99.5%, Samchun Chemicals) was utilized as a dilution co-reactant for GC/mass spectrometer (GC/MS, Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 SE) analysis. Palladium on activated charcoals (5% Pd basis, powder) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich Co. Ltd. Before reactions, the catalysts were reduced at 473K for 2h with 30% H2/N2."
3,Catalytic reaction,"2.2 Catalytic reaction A batch-type reactor (50mL) made by Hanwoul Engineering Co., Ltd. (South Korea) was used for deoxygenation reaction of CJO. 3g of CJO and 0.3g of catalyst (Pd/C) were added into the vessel. After the vessel was closed, the reactor was purged with 30ml/min of N2 for 10min and co-reactant (D.W. or formic acid solution (30%)) was injected into the vessel. For the batch reaction, co-reactant was injected after N2 purging because formic acid solution, one of co-reactants, reacts immediately with Pd/C even at room temperature. The reaction pressure was started from atmospheric pressure. When the temperature of the reactor was reached at setting value, then, agitation was started (300rpm) and the reaction was conducted for 4h. When the reaction time was over, the reactor was cooled to room temperature and liquid and gas products were collected on a vial and a tedlar bag (SKC Inc.), respectively. The continuous catalytic reaction of CJO in the fixed bed reactor is very important, because the reaction is 3-phase reaction. Therefore, a continuous deoxygenation reaction was carried out in a fixed bed reactor made by T-ENG Engineering Co., Ltd. (South Korea). 5g of catalyst (Pd/C) was filled in a stainless steel reactor (I.D=19mm) and both ends of the reactor were filled with quartz wool and inert ceramic ball (4–5mm in diameter) for homogeneous distribution of reactants. The length of the catalyst bed was 15mm. The reactant was diluted with co-reactants (reactant:co-reactant=2:3wt.%) and was injected with micro pump (Young Lin Instrument Co., Ltd, SP930D) at 0.3ml/min. The reaction temperature was maintained at 633K and the system pressure, 4MPa, was controlled by a back-pressure regulator, located in the stream of gas outlet, to allow the sufficient time to contact and then react between the liquid reactant and in-situ generated hydrogen over the surface of Pd/C catalyst. The reaction was carried out under a fixed flow of N2 (20ml/min) and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) was 1.35h−1."
4,Analysis,"2.3 Analysis The liquid product was analyzed by two methods (quantifying the acid number and GC/MS). Quantifying the acid number was utilized to evaluate the ratio of free fatty acid in the liquid product and GC/MS analysis identified the compositions and their fraction of the liquid product. For the more information on liquid product analysis such as pretreatment methods of the liquid sample, detailed GC program and analysis method of the acid number, refer to our previous work [11]. The C, H, N and S contents in the reactant were measured by element analyzer (Thermo Scientific, Flash 2000 serie) and the oxygen contents in the reactant and the liquid product were measured by O2-element analyzer (EA, Thermo Finnigan, FlashEA 1112). The analysis of gas product was conducted by using GC (Agilent technologies, 7890A GC system) equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and flame ionization detector (FID). The columns for TCD and FID were Supelco packed column (carboxen 1004) and Agilent J&W capillary column (GS-Alumina), respectively. The injector temperature was 523K and detector’s one was 523K (TCD) and 573K (FID), respectively. Oven temperature was kept at 323K for 5min, increased from 323K to 443K with a ramp rate of 303Kmin−1 and then kept for 2min. In order to measure the exact amount of each gas product, we employed a standard gas manufactured by Special Gas (South Korea), which is composed of H2, N2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H6, C3H8, and C4H10."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of CJO,"3.1 Characterization of CJO CJO is dark brown. The composition of CJO, which was measured by GC analysis of FAME converted from the oil, is summarized in Table. 1 . Unsaturated free fatty acids, C18:1 and C18:2, accounted for around 80% in the composition of the oil, while saturated fatty acids, C16:0 and C18:0, made up around 20%. Unsaturated ones should be hydrogenated to saturated ones prior to the catalytic deoxygenation in order to accelerate the reaction rate and also to prevent severe deactivation of catalysts [18]. The elemental composition of CJO comprised 77.16% carbon, 11.59% hydrogen and 11.25% oxygen. The acid number of CJO was 4.4%, indicating that TG was predominant in CJO. The pH value was 6.71 and density was 0.897g/ml at room temperature."
7,Catalytic deoxygenation reaction of CJO,"3.2 Catalytic deoxygenation reaction of CJO 3.2.1 Hydrogen in-situ produced from formic acid solution Formic acid generates hydrogen via its reforming reaction on Pd/C catalyst even at room temperature, as reported previously [21]. Fig. 2 shows the results of the reforming reaction of formic acid solution (30%) with or without Pd/C catalyst. Reforming products, H2 and CO2, were produced at 613K in the absence of catalyst and in assistance of Pd/C, the larger amount of hydrogen was produced and traces such as CH4 and CO were detected. This means that the formic acid solution can be a good hydrogen donor to hydrogenate unsaturated FFAs into saturated ones. 3.2.2 Catalytic deoxygenation reaction of CJO Fig. 3 shows the results of catalytic deoxygenation reaction of CJO according to the co-reactants at 613K in the batch reactor. When no co-reactant was added to the reactant, oxy-free hydrocarbons accounted for around 79% (51% for paraffin, 5% for olefin, and 22% for aromatics) in the liquid-phase product, as shown in Fig.3(a). The produced paraffin and olefin were normal hydrocarbon in the range of C10–C18 (mostly C15 and C17). However, oxygen-containing molecules such as ketone and alcohol and unidentified compounds were found in the liquid product (about 10%). Fig.3(b) showed that CO2 was predominant in the gas-phase product, indicating that decarboxylation reaction was occurred over Pd/C catalyst [16]. Some light gases were also detected, which appeared to be originated from the cracking reaction of the reactant. In case D.W. was used as co-reactant, a little bit higher amount of hydrocarbons (around 88%) was produced than no co-reactant test, but olefin hydrocarbon was not detected in the liquid product. This means that hydrogen in-situ produced from the given reaction condition assists to hydrogenate unsaturated FFAs to saturated ones, as reported in the literatures [18]. Some trances containing oxygen in their molecules were founded in the liquid product. Amount of gas products were larger than the result of no co-reactant test and CO2 was still dominant gas product (Fig.3(b)). Even though some hydrogen was generated from the given reaction condition and then assisted the hydrogenation reaction, FFAs in the liquid product were still remained. Whereas, when formic acid solution was used as a co-reactant, the liquid product was all paraffinic hydrocarbons (pentadecane and heptadecane) and the percentage of FFAs was near to zero. After deoxygenation reaction, an extremely larger amount of hydrogen and carbon dioxide were occurred. Compared with the amount of gases in Fig. 2 (in case of no reactant added), the amount of hydrogen decreased while carbon dioxide increased. Some hydrogen appeared to be consumed for hydrogenation of unsaturated FFAs and carbon dioxide seemed to add as product gas of decarboxylation reaction of saturated FFAs (C16 and C18 FFAs→C15 and C17 hydrocarbons+CO2). Fig. 4 shows the results of catalytic deoxygenation reaction of CJO according to the amount of formic acid at 613K in the batch reactor. A small amount addition of formic acid solution (1g) induced lower FFA percentage and higher percentage of saturated hydrocarbons than those in case of D.W. addition. This indicates that in-situ generated hydrogen make deoxygenation reaction more favorable by converting unsaturated FFAs into saturated FFA. With increase of the amount of formic acid solution in the reactants, the amount of total gases occurred steadily increased, as shown in Fig.4(b). The effect of reaction temperatures on deoxygenation reaction of CJO is shown in Fig. 5 . Regardless of co-reactants used, the lower the reaction temperature is the lower the degree of deoxygenation of CJO. At 573K, when formic acid solution was added into reactant, the percentage of hydrocarbons in the liquid product was 2 times higher in case of D.W. addition and aromatics were not found at tested all reaction temperatures. Whereas, oxygen-containing molecules such as ketone and alcohol and unidentified compounds were observed in the liquid product from D.W. added reactant. Deoxygenation reactions of FFAs, originated from CJO, were carried out in the fixed bed reactor according to the co-reactants, D.W. and formic acid solution, and their results are shown in Fig. 6 . In here, the liquid products obtained at 7h after reaction (time-on-stream=7h) were analyzed and compared. After reaction with D.W., the liquid product went hard at room temperature, indicating that a large amount of FFAs was still present in it. Indeed, the percentage of FFA calculated from the acid number was 71% in the liquid phase. From the analysis results of GC, it is observed that the most of them was saturated FFAs such as stearic acid and palmitic acid. As shown in Fig. 6(a-1), hydrocarbons occupied about 65% in the liquid product, but about 26% of them were unsaturated hydrocarbons, which is different from the results in the batch reaction. This might be due to the short residence time in the fixed bed reactor. Furthermore, oxygen-containing compounds were observed in the wide range of carbon number, as shown in Fig. 6(a-2). In particular, the oxygen-containing compounds detected under about 27min were identified as FFAs having much lower molecular weight than those in CJO, which might be products of cracking reaction of FFAs originated from CJO. Whereas, when using formic acid solution, the liquid product kept remained liquefied at room temperature and the percentage of FFA was below 0.9%. The liquid yield was 93.13%, significantly higher than that (62.5%) in case of DW addition as the co-reactant. Note that the weight of co-reactant was excluded from the calculation of the liquid yield. Based on the results of GC analysis, normal hydrocarbon was main product, about 97%, and traces was detected (Fig. 6(b-2)). Dos Anjos et al. [22] reported that the degree of unsaturation of the oil significantly affected on the products and saturated FFAs yielded pure hydrocarbons. Indeed, based on the results, the formic solution was effective as hydrogen donor and effectively prehydrogenated unsaturated FFAs to saturated ones, which induced hydrocarbon products with high selectivity, as shown in Fig. 6(b-2). Interestingly, some hydrogen took part in the deoxygenation reaction of FFAs (C16 and C18 FFAs+H2 →C16 and C18 hydrocarbons+H2O), based on the result of liquid product (Fig. 6(b-2)). When considering the liquid yield, net production of oxy-free hydrocarbon was above 90%, which was much higher than that (about 40%) in case of DW addition as the co-reactant. EA analysis showed that the liquid product was contained a small amount of oxygen, about 0.05%, meaning that the degree of deoxygenation was about 99.5%."
8,Catalyst deactivation,"3.3 Catalyst deactivation Catalyst deactivation is inevitable during the catalytic reaction. In case of reactions with long chain reactants like crude oils, adsorption, accumulation and blocking of reactants, intermediates and products in the pores of catalyst are commonly occurred [23]. In particular, if the reactants contain a large amount of poly unsaturated compounds, the degree of deactivation is more accelerated because the heavy intermediates are dominantly occurred in the absence of hydrogen. In the present work, catalysts used for deoxygenation reaction of CJO in the batch reactor were separated, washed with acetone and then dried in order to analyze the surface area and texture parameters of catalysts and then to reveal the degree of catalyst deactivation. Table 2 summarizes the BET surface area, pore volume and mean pore diameter of used catalysts. The fresh Pd/C catalyst has high total surface area of 690m2/g and total pore volume of 0.68cm3/g. After the reactions, total surface area and total pore volume of used catalysts followed the order Pd/C–formic acid solution>Pd/C–D.W.>Pd/C–no co-reactant under constant conditions. After catalytic deoxygenation reactions with either no co-reactant or D.W., pore volume in micro-size was zero, surface area was near to zero and mean pore diameter increased 3.94nm to above 10nm. This means that most of micro-pores are blocked by long-chain reactants, intermediates and products. In contrast, about 66% of total pore volume of the fresh catalyst was alive and meso and macro pores were kept like fresh catalyst, even though the micro pore was also significantly diminished, in case of the reaction assisted by formic acid solution as the hydrogen donor. Based on the results of texture parameters of spend catalysts, it can be expected higher catalyst resistance to deactivation in the presence of formic acid solution during the continuous catalytic reaction. Fig. 7 shows the results of catalytic deoxygenation reactions in the presences of two different co-reactants in the fixed bed reactor as a function of time-on-stream. The addition of formic acid solution in the catalytic deoxygenation reaction promoted significantly the degree of deoxygenation in the initial stage (∼7h of time-on-stream). Although the rapid decrease in the degree of deoxygenation was observed after 7h of time-on-stream, about 50% reduction in the initial degree of deoxygenation was observed at around 11h of time-on-stream. On the other hand, the initial degree of deoxygenation in the continuous catalytic reaction with D.W. co-reactant was relatively low and at around 7h of time-on-stream, about 50% reduction in the initial degree of deoxygenation was observed. This indicates that it is favorable to use formic acid solution in terms of both the catalytic deoxygenation reaction and initial deactivation of the catalyst. Of However, different deactivation reasons including Pd sintering should be further examined and effective catalyst regeneration methods should be investigated."
9,Conclusion,"The catalytic deoxygenation reaction of CJO was carried out to produce oxy-free hydrocarbons in assistance with in-situ produced hydrogen, without any external hydrogen supply and addition effect of formic acid was discussed on the deoxygenation reaction and product distribution. In the present investigation, formic acid solution (30%) was used as a co-reactant and also a hydrogen donor with commercialized Pd[5]/C catalyst. For comparison purpose, D.W. was also used for the reaction. When D.W. was added as co-reactant in the batch reactor for deoxygenation test of CJO, the liquid-phase product contained oxy-free hydrocarbons of around 88%, where the produced paraffin was normal hydrocarbon in the range of C10–C18 (mostly C15 and C17). Whereas, mixing of formic acid into reactant yielded higher oil conversion and higher selectivity to normal hydrocarbon (mainly C15 and C17) than those of the other cases (no mixing or water addition). In the fixed bed reaction using the mixture of oil and formic acid, normal hydrocarbon was main product, about 97%, in the liquid product and the degree of deoxygenation was about 99.5%. After the reactions in the batch reactor, total surface area and total pore volume of used catalysts followed the order Pd/C–formic acid solution>Pd/C–water>Pd/C–no co-reactant under constant conditions. As results of continuous reaction in the fixed bed reactor, significantly higher degree of deoxygenation with a high initial resistance to catalyst deactivation was observed on Pd/C catalyst in the presence of formic acid. This means that addition of formic acid solution as the hydrogen donor is favorable the deoxygenation reaction and the initial deactivation of catalyst."
