0,Introduction,"Natural gas is viewed more and more as an alternative and transitional feedstock, and the ability to convert it to a wide range of fuels and chemicals has attracted interest since the 1920s. Among all the natural gas-derived products, higher alcohols are attractive targets since they can be used as transport fuels, fuel additives, and as intermediates for high-value chemicals in areas such as medicine, cosmetics, chemicals, and polyester production [1,2]. The direct conversion of natural gas-derived syngas into higher alcohols via the Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) process is viewed as the most promising option given its simpliﬁed operation, environmental friendliness, and low energy consumption [3,4]. Among the higher alcohol synthesis (HAS) catalytic systems, the Co-based catalysts have been intensively studied given their strong ability for long-chain product formation, low water-gas shift reaction, and economic feasibility. This type of catalysts usually includes the second or the third element, which can promote the CO insertion for oxygenates formation. In such a way, the synergy between Co and other metallic elements (M) can increase the higher alcohol formation, such as Co-Cu [5,6], Co-Fe [7,8], Co-Cu-Fe [9,10], and Co-Cu-Ce [11,12]. However, most of the Co-M catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation or impregnation; both routes of which do not allow the precise control of the active center distribution. To favor the synergy between Co and other elements, perovskite oxide that can accommodate several different metal cations into its framework, has been used as a catalyst [13]. Perovskite oxide has an ABO3 compositional formula, in which the metal cations in its A and B sites are arranged in three-dimensional ordered pattern in the atomic level. Tien-Thao et al. [14] found that for LaCo0.7Cu0.3O3-δ perovskite catalysts, the uniformly distributed Co-Cu alloy formed after reduction with strong synergetic eﬀ ;ect, which act as the active centers for HAS and exhibited high selectivity towards C2+OH (higher alcohols containing two or more carbon atoms). Moreover, Co2C was found to be universally present in the Co-Cu bimetallic perovskite catalysts during the CO hydrogenation [15–17]. It is acknowledged that the Co2C species have the noble-metal-like properties and can promote the non-dissociative adsorption of CO and the subsequent CO insertion to form oxygenates [18]. The co-existence of Co-Cu alloy and Co2C species in Co-Cu bimetallic catalysts was found to enhance the C2+OH selectivity, according to Liu et al.’s research work [17]. The synergistic effect of the Co-Ni alloy derived from perovskite structure also manifested into high selectivity to C2+OH, with Co catalyzing the formation of the hydrocarbon groups via the CO dissociation and Ni promoting the CO insertion to form higher alcohols [19]. Although significant progress on the conversion of syngas to higher alcohols has been made, the catalytic performance for HAS is still unsatisfactory. The trimetallic catalyst is considered as a good candidate for HAS reaction as it provides flexibility of tuning the active centers and the catalyst properties. Due to the unique structure of perovskite, the combination of active centers could be precisely controlled. Under this context, trimetallic Co-Ni-Cu perovskite was chosen as the catalyst precursor in this study. Besides the catalyst structure and composition, the higher alcohol formation also shows a tight correlation with the promoter, especially the alkalis [20,21]. These basic promoters neutralize the acidity of the catalyst supports and thus inhibit undesired reactions such as methanation, alcohol dehydration, and coke formation [22,23]. More importantly, the use of alkali elements as catalyst promoters brought substantial improvements in higher alcohol selectivity and prolonged the catalyst lifetime [24,25]. The eﬀ ;ect of alkali metals on the HAS has been studied intensively for modified methanol synthesis catalysts, but has been rather overlooked for Co-based catalysts [26]. Ishida et al. [27] reported that the addition of Na can decrease the reducibility of Co/SiO2 catalyst; leading to the improved catalyst activity and selectivity of higher alcohols. While Wang et al. [28] attributed the increased ethanol selectivity over K-promoted Co-based catalyst to the formation of Co2C, Tien-Thao et al. [25] suggested the enhanced propagation of the carbon chain growth as the main reason behind the HAS obtained from adding alkali metals to bimetallic LaCo0.7Cu0.3O3-δ perovskite catalyst. Therefore, the mechanism behind the ability of alkali elements to promote HAS over Co-based catalysts has not been completely clarified. Moreover, there have been no specific studies on the effect of alkalis on the trimetallic Co-based catalysts for HAS. In this paper, a new B-site trimetallic perovskite catalyst with a composition of La0.9Sr0.1Co0.8Ni0.1Cu0.1O3 was used as the catalyst precursor that allows homogeneous dispersion of Co, Ni, and Cu in single catalyst body. The same loading (0.5 wt.%) of the mostly used alkali promoters Na and K were added to study the effect of alkali promoters on the tri-metallic Co-Ni-Cu-based catalyst for HAS. Relationships were established between the catalyst structures/compositions and their performances using several characterization techniques, which include ICP-OES, N2 sorption, SEM, H2-TPR, XRD, and XPS. The prepared perovskite catalyst with alkali promoters showed enhanced higher alcohol distribution and carbon elimination ability that prevents the catalyst deactivation."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Lanthanum nitrates (La(NO3)3·6H2O, 99.99%), strontium nitrates (Sr(NO3)2, >99.0%), cobalt nitrates (Co(NO3)3.6H2O, 99.999%), nickel nitrates (Ni(NO3)2.6H2O, 99.999%), copper nitrates (Cu(NO3)2.3H2O, 99.999%), sodium carbonates (Na2CO3, 99.99%), potassium carbonates (K2CO3, 99.99%), and ammonia water (35% mass fraction) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used directly without further purification."
3,Catalysts preparation,"2.2 Catalysts preparation Co-precipitation method was used to prepare La0.9Sr0.1Co0.8Ni0.1Cu0.1O3 (LSCNC) perovskite catalysts following the procedure reported elsewhere [29]. A solution mixture containing the required stoichiometric amount of lanthanum, strontium, cobalt, nickel, and copper nitrates, was prepared in a beaker. The molar ratio of the obtained precipitate is La: Sr: Co: Ni: Cu = 0.9:0.1:0.8:0.1:0.1. Then, aqueous ammonia solution was added into the above solution dropwise under stirring until a pH of 9 was obtained. The precipitate was then dried at 120 °C overnight and calcined in flowing air at 800 °C for 5 h. To deposit alkali metals on the catalyst surface, the incipient-wetness impregnation method was employed. A certain volume of alkali carbonate (Na2CO3 or K2CO3) solution (0.217 and 0.128 mol L−1, respectively) was added to the calcined perovskites to reach incipient wetness. After aging for 24 h at room temperature, the paste was dried for 8 h at 110 °C and then calcined in air at 800 °C for 6 h using a ramping rate of 2 °C min−1. The final alkali metals loading amount for each catalyst was 0.5 wt.%. The obtained catalysts are denoted as Na-LSCNC and K-LSCNC."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization A Micromeritics Tristar II apparatus for N2 sorption at liquid nitrogen temperature was used to measure the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas of the catalysts. The atomic compositions of the perovskite catalysts were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) using a Perkin Elmer Optima 8300 ICP-OES Spectrometer. The concentrations of the components obtained in parts per million were converted into atomic concentrations using the atomic weights of the metals. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the catalysts were obtained using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Co-Kα radiation (λ = 1.78897 nm). The patterns were collected over a range of 2θ of 15-75° at a scan rate of 5° min−1. The morphologies of samples were investigated with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Zeiss Neon 40 EsB). The temperature programmed reduction under H2 (H2-TPR) tests were performed using ChemBET 3000 equipment. About 0.1 g of catalyst was pre-treated at 300 °C under a nitrogen flow rate of 20 mL min−1 for 1 h and then cooled down to 50 °C. Then, 5% H2 in N2 gas at a flow rate of 20 mL min−1 was introduced into the system before the temperature was increased from room temperature to 700 °C at a ramping rate of 5 °C min−1. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) was carried out on a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD system using an Al Kα source and the C1s peak at 284.6 eV as the internal standard."
5,Catalytic activity measurements,"2.4 Catalytic activity measurements The HAS tests were carried out in a high-flow fixed-bed reactor (Spider 3 F-T instrument, AMTech, Germany) illustrated in Fig. 1 . Detailed description of the experimental procedures is given elsewhere [19]. Shortly, 0.5 g of catalyst (particle size of 53–105 u m) were mixed with 1.5 g of alumina before loading into the down-flow fixed-bed reactor for in situ reduction at 450 °C and ambient pressure using an H2/N2 gas mixture at a flow rate of 100 mL min−1 with a molar ratio of 1:4 overnight. After the reduction, the reactor was pressurized to 3.0 MPa under continuous N2 flow and cooled down to 270 °C. A syngas mixture (H2/CO/N2 = 2:1:3, where N2 acted as the internal standard gas for analyzing the reacted gas) at a flow rate of 200 mL min−1 was passed through each reactor with a slowly increasing temperature at a ramping rate of 1 °C min−1. The reaction was carried out at 270 °C, 3.0 MPa, and a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 10,995 ml.gcat −1 h−1. The reaction products were directly analyzed online using a gas chromatography/mass spectrometer (Agilent 7890/5977 GC/MS). The temperature of the transfer lines between the reactor and the valves was kept at 200 °C to avoid the condensation of the products. The packed column TDX-01 was connected to the thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for analysis of the non-condensed gas. The MS HP-5 column was connected to the mass spectrometer for the analysis of all organic products. The CO conversion (XCO) was calculated following Eq. (1): (1) X C O = M o l e C O i n - M o l e C O o u t M o l e C O i n × 100 % The selectivity of CH4 and CO2 were calculated according to Eq. (2): (2) S X = M o l e X o u t M o l e C O i n - M o l e C O o u t × 100 % The distribution of alcohols was calculated following Eq. (3): (3) A l c o h o l d i s t r i b u t i o n C - m o l % = M i × n i ∑ i M i × n i × 100 % where MoleXout is the moles of CH4 or CO2 in the outlet gas stream, respectively. Mi is the mole of the alcohol i and ni is the number of carbons in the alcohol. Each reaction was carried out for 24 h and the data shown for each experiment was the average value of the 3–4 measurements taken between ca. 18–24 h on stream."
6,Results and discussion,
7,"Composition, textural properties and structure","3.1 Composition, textural properties and structure The bulk compositions of the non-promoted and alkali-promoted perovskite catalysts from ICP-OES and their specific surface areas (SBET) from nitrogen sorption are listed in Table 1 . The nominal perovskite composition obtained from ICP-OES was La0.87Sr0.13Co0.8Ni0.11Cu0.09O3, with the weight ratio of Co, Ni, and Cu in close agreement with the theoretical values of the LSCNC perovskite catalyst. The weight loading of Na and K promoters on LSCNC catalyst was slightly higher than the targeted composition. Due to the relatively high calcination temperature of 800 °C used to prepare the perovskite catalysts, the SBET of all the catalysts were rather low (below 5 m2 g−1) [29]. The variation of SBET among the three samples is within the experimental error. These differences are considered too small to affect the catalyst performance. The powder XRD patterns of LSCNC, Na-LSCNC, and K-LSCNC perovskite catalysts are presented in Fig. 2 A. The diffraction peaks of these three 800 °C calcined samples constitute the characteristics peaks of LaCoO3 (JCPDS-ICDD 48-0123), with the typical doublet peak at 2θ ≈ 38-39° which can be assigned to the well-defined rhombohedral structure [29]. Co3O4 (JCPDS-ICDD 80-1541) is present in considerably less amount than LaCoO3. No additional peaks appear for the alkali-promoted catalysts, i.e., Na-LSCNC and K-LSCNC relative to the non-promoted catalyst, i.e., LSCNC, which indicates the perovskite structure was not affected by the addition of alkalis. The XPS spectra of Co 2p level for the three perovskite catalysts are displayed in Fig. 2B. The LSCNC exhibited two peaks centered at 779.8 and 794.8 eV, which is well matched with the reported value for the Co3+ ions in the LaCoO3 perovskite structure [30]. The low satellite peak appears at a binding energy of 789.6 eV can be attributed to the typical satellite peak of Co2+ in Co3O4 [31]. The similar XPS spectra are observed with the addition of alkalis, indicating there is no significant change in the electronic state of the Co species for fresh perovskite catalysts with alkali promoters. Fig. 2C–E revealed the SEM micrographs of the perovskite catalysts without and with alkali promoters. The calcination in flowing air generated the relatively homogeneous particle-size distribution in regular shapes for LSCNC catalyst. Na-LSCNC and K-LSCNC catalysts have the similar surface morphology and particle size, suggesting that the addition of alkali metals has no significant effect on the morphology of the LSCNC perovskite catalyst."
8,Effect of the alkali promoters on the reducibility,"3.2 Effect of the alkali promoters on the reducibility The H2-TPR profiles of the perovskite catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 A. LSCNC displayed a two-step reduction process. The low-temperature peak that comes out at between 200 and 370 °C corresponds to the overlapping reduction of Co3+ to Co2+, Ni3+ to Ni2+, and Cu2+ to Cu0, respectively [14,32]. The second peak at above 400 °C represents the reduction of Co2+ to Co0 and Ni2+ to Ni0. Relative to LSCNC, the reduction peaks of alkali-promoted catalysts (Na and K) shifted to higher temperatures; indicating that the presence of alkali suppresses the reduction of cobalt, nickel, and copper ions. Identical observations for alkali-promoted Co-based catalysts were reported by Tien-Thao et al. [25] and Dalmon et al. [33]. Moreover, the H2 consumption of the alkali-promoted catalysts during the reduction was lower than that of the LSCNC catalyst (Fig. 3B); following the order of K-LSCNC < Na-LSCNC < LSCNC. Lower H2 consumption suggests that lower amount of metal oxide was reduced to form active centers. The most plausible reason to explain this observation is that alkali metals serve as electronic promoters, which suppress the H2 chemisorption on the catalyst surface; resulting in a more difficult reduction of metal oxide ions [21,34]. Therefore, the addition of alkali promoters not only increases the catalyst reduction temperature but also decreases the extent of the reduction. To identify the active centers, the 450 °C reduced perovskite catalysts were subjected to powder XRD analyses; the results of which are shown in Fig. 3C. After the reduction, the characteristic peaks of the original perovskite phase observed in Fig. 2A disappeared. For example, the intense original diffraction peaks that appears at 2θ of 38-39° become absent in the powder XRD patterns of the three reduced perovskite catalysts (Fig. 3C-left). The perovskite phase degradation was accompanied by the formation of La2O3 (JCPDS-ICDD 74-2430) and/or La2SrOx (JCPDS-ICDD 42-0343). Both La2O3 and La2SrOx phases were present in LSCNC case. In Na-LSCNC case, only La2O3 formed while in K-LSCNC case, only La2SrOx appeared. This observation indicates that the interaction between La and Sr was affected by the alkali promoter addition. New diffraction peak appears for all the reduced catalysts, which is present at 2θ of 51.8°, in the vicinity of the expected 2θ positions for the (111) diffraction peaks of cobalt (51.83°), nickel (52.18°), and copper (50.73°). The corresponding d111-spacing of this new peak was 2.0456 Å, which is smaller than that of Co and Cu (2.0467 Å and 2.0880 Å, respectively) but higher than Ni (2.0340 Å). This indicates the lattice distortion as cobalt ions were partially replaced by nickel and copper ions; leading to the formation of the Co-Ni-Cu alloy after reduction that is consistent with the observation of Lus et al. [35]. Alkali addition appears to reduce the intensity of the diffraction peak of Co-Ni-Cu alloy. Such reduction in the alloy peak intensity and the reduction in the average crystallite size obtained by alkali addition (Table 1) likely indicates improved Co-Ni-Cu alloy dispersion contributed by alkali promoter."
9,Effect of the alkali promoters on the spent catalysts,"3.3 Effect of the alkali promoters on the spent catalysts Powder XRD analyses were also carried out to characterize the spent catalysts after reaction at 325 °C (Fig. 4 A). The previously detected La2O3/La2SrOx phases on the reduced catalysts were absent. These phases likely transformed to LaCO3OH species (JCPDS-ICDD 26-0815) that were present over all the surfaces of the catalysts during the reaction. In the spent K-LSCNC catalyst case nonetheless, La2O2CO3 phase (JCPDS-ICDD 22-0642) was generated as the major phase. Tsipouriari et al. [36] reported that La2O2CO3 phase formation comes from the reaction of La2O3 and CO2, which can eliminate the carbon deposition through La2O2CO3+C(s) → La2O3+2CO reaction to improve the catalyst stability. Nevertheless, the reaction of La2O2CO3 with CO2 and H2O to form LaCO3OH becomes inevitable during the CO hydrogenation reaction [37]. This result suggests that the addition of K prevents the hydrogenation of La2O2CO3 during the reaction. On the other hand, new diffraction peaks appear at 2θ of 48.3°, 49.8°, and 53.6° in the powder XRD pattern of LSCNC catalyst after the reaction at 325 °C, which can be assigned to the (002), (111), and (021) facets of Co2C (JCPDS-ICDD 72-1369) (Fig. 4A). Relative to the reduced catalysts, the diffraction peaks of Co-Ni-Cu alloy at 2θ of 51.8° were also weaker and broader after the reaction (Compare Fig. 4A-right to Fig. 3C-right). Therefore, it can be deduced that a main portion of the trimetallic alloy decomposed and reacted with CO to form Co2C during the reaction, reproducing the observations in the previous studies [16,17,38,39]. Although the Co2C phase was reported to disappear under H2 flow over 300 °C, Pei et al. [40] suggested the presence of CO during the reaction could stabilize the corresponding carbide and prevent its complete decomposition. Furthermore, Wang et al. [28] proved that even after reaction at 325 °C, the Co2C phase still able to be observed in the used metal-organic framework-derived Co-based catalyst. In this work, the XRD results confirm that the Co2C phase was also maintained over the perovskite-derived catalysts after reaction at 325 °C. Note that some diffraction peaks of Co2C and La2O2CO3 are overlapping in 2θ range of 49-54°. If the Co2C (002) facet peak at 2θ of 48.3° is selected as the baseline for the peak intensity, it becomes clear that the intensities of these overlapped peaks increase gradually when the alkali promoters, i.e., Na and K were present. This can be attributed to the improved carbonization of the Co particles due to the existence of the alkalis [41,42]. According to Lebarbier et al. [43], the reduction in the crystallite size of the Co species may enhance the formation of Co2C. Therefore, a combination of the alkali promoters and the smaller Co-Ni-Cu crystallite sizes (Refer to Table 1) may facilitate the Co2C formation during the CO hydrogenation reactions [28,42,44]. It should be noted that there were no Ni and Cu carbides observed in the used catalysts, possibly due to their low concentration. The relationship between catalyst structure/compositions and their performances will be discussed in more details shortly. XPS was used to characterize the oxidation states of the metal surface species in the spent catalysts subjected to reaction at 325 °C. The resultant Co 2p XPS spectra are shown in Fig. 4B. The three catalysts display identical Co 2p spectra, which feature the Co 2p3/2 peaks centered at ∼780.3 eV with satellite peaks at ∼786.4 eV and Co 2p1/2 peaks at ∼797 eV with satellite peaks at ∼802.6 eV. The presence of satellite structure in these three spectra leads to the deconvolution of Co 2p3/2. For the spent LSCNC catalyst, the Co 2p3/2 main peak at 780.4 eV can be assigned to Co2+, whereas the peak with the lowest BE at 778.4 eV can be associated to the metallic Co component [44,45]. In accordance to the powder XRD results (Fig. 4A), Co2+ species in the spent catalysts should come from Co2C phase. It has been known that the metallic Co0 phase is unstable in oxygen-containing atmosphere. However, Co0 on the surface of the spent perovskite catalysts was clearly present here. This may be rationalized in terms of the presence of Co2C, which is present in intimate contact with the Co metallic catalysts and prevent the oxidation to some extent. With the addition of Na or K promoter, the Co2+/Co0 ratio estimated from the signal areas increases, following the order of LSCNC (4.3) < Na-LSCNC (5.8) < K-LSCNC (6.3) (Fig. 4B). Thus, in the presence of alkali promoters, larger amount of surface Co2C formed after reaction at 325 °C, which is consistent with the increase of the Co2C peak intensity in the powder XRD patterns shown in Fig. 4A. Fig. 5 shows the powder XRD patterns of the catalysts after reaction at 340 °C. For K-LSCNC catalyst, the catalyst phase constituents after reaction at 325 °C and 340 °C are identical, i.e., Co-Ni-Cu alloy/Co2C-La2O2CO3-LaCO3OH. Although the peak intensity of LaCO3OH subjected to reaction at 340 °C increases compared to the spent catalyst at 325 °C, the La2O2CO3 phase is still dominant with no evidence of carbon deposition. For Na-promoted catalyst, the coke deposition occurred due to the negligible formation of La2O2CO3; resulting in the rather weak diffraction peaks of Co-Ni-Cu trimetallic alloy. The carbon deposition also became significant on the surface of the non-promoted LSCNC catalyst with no trimetallic alloy sign evident on the spent catalyst. In LSCNC catalyst case, carbonaceous components that include Co3C and surface carbon were detected as dominant phases; the presence of which normally causes the catalyst deactivation [46]."
10,Effect of alkali promoters on catalytic activity for HAS,"3.4 Effect of alkali promoters on catalytic activity for HAS Since alkali promoted LSCNC catalysts contain similar Na and K content (0.67 and 0.64 wt.%), their activities are comparable for the same reaction. Fig. 6 displays the catalytic performances of LSCNC catalysts with and without alkali promoters at between 270 and 340 °C, 3.0 MPa, and a GHSV of 10,995 ml.gcat −1 h−1. CO conversion of the non-promoted LSCNC catalyst increased with temperature rise between 270 and 325 °C (Fig. 6A). The addition of alkali promoters into the perovskite catalyst translates into lowered CO conversion except at the highest temperature of 340 °C. Powder XRD results for the spent catalysts at 325 °C (Fig. 4A) have shown that Co2C formation during the reaction was promoted by the addition of Na and K. Li et al. [42] reported that Co2C is active for CO non-dissociative adsorption, which is normally sluggish in CO conversion. As a result, it can be hypothesized that Co0 transformation to Co2C decreases the available Co0 active center for CO dissociation, thereby resulting in low CO conversion. On the other hand, the alkali-promoted catalysts exhibited high CO2 selectivity (Fig. 6C), suggesting that the alkali presence promoted the water-gas shift reaction; in agreement with the other reports [20,47]. However, unique catalysts behaviors were observed at 340 °C. CO conversion, methane selectivity, and CO2 selectivity of LSCNC decreased significantly at 340 °C (Fig. 6A–C). The powder XRD results of the spent LSCNC catalyst at 340 °C (Fig. 5) reveal that after the reaction, the Co-Ni-Cu alloy was completely decomposed and surface carbonaceous formed. The coke deposition on the catalyst surface led to the catalyst deactivation. Na-promoted catalyst also showed similar reduction trend at 340 °C although it appears to be less pronounced compared to that for the non-promoted catalyst. In contrast, CO conversion of K-LSCNC catalyst increased almost exponentially with temperature rise and reached its maximum of 41% at 340 °C, at which point, methane selectivity and CO2 selectivity reached 49.9% and 19.4%, respectively (Fig. 6A–C). K-promoted catalyst displayed superior reduction of carbon deposition among the three catalysts due to the presence of La2O2CO3 phase (Fig. 5). The potassium metal presence on the catalyst surface appears to provide protective role that suppress the carbon deposition on the catalyst, which eventually stabilizes and prevents the catalyst deactivation [48]. Since this work was focused on higher alcohol formation, the selectivity of hydrocarbon products is not included here. The catalytic performance for HAS is demonstrated by higher alcohol distribution. Fig. 6D displays higher alcohol distribution of the perovskite catalysts. The presence of alkali promoter generally improved the higher alcohol distribution especially at higher temperatures. To assess the relationship between the alkali promoters and higher alcohol formation, the detailed alcohol distribution at 325 °C was plotted (Fig. 7 ). Upon adding alkali promoters to LSCNC catalyst, methanol production was lessened while higher alcohols generation was enhanced. For K-LSCNC catalyst, the distribution of methanol (17.8%) diminished dramatically to half of that for LSCNC catalyst (38.2%); leading to the dominant formation of ethanol as the main alcohol product. Na-LSCNC catalyst showed identical behavior although to a less extent than K-LSCNC catalyst. C2+OH/methanol ratio increases in the order of LSCNC < Na-LSCNC < K-LSCNC, which correlates with the aforementioned increase in Co2C/Co0 ratio in the same order of catalysts. As is reported previously, Co2C is active for non-dissociative adsorption, and the interface between Co2C and Co0 favors the oxygenate formation given its ability for CO insertion [28]. The results here supported by the powder XRD and XPS results of the spent catalysts at 325 °C above indicate that the addition of alkali promoters enhances the Co2C formation during the reaction, which is active for higher alcohol formation. Fig. 8 displays the Anderson-Schulz-Flory (A-S-F) plots of alcohol distribution (mol%) for LSCNC, Na-LSCNC, and K-LSCNC perovskite catalysts. C2-C8 alcohols followed the linear A-S-F distribution while methanol exhibited a negative deviation. The chain-growth probability α was 0.47 for LSCNC catalyst, which is lower than that of Na-LSCNC (0.48) and K-LSCNC (0.53). Although alkali metals are inactive for alcohols formation, their presence can promote effective change in the alcohol distribution, which is likely due to the basicity of the alkali metal that improves the stability of the CHx intermediate species and thus prolongs the carbon chain [25,49]. Furthermore, the deviation of methanol in alkali-promoted catalysts was more significant than that of non-promoted LSCNC catalysts; suggesting that the addition of alkali promoter facilitated the chain propagation, especially for the conversion of methanol to ethanol. This is in accord with the alcohol distribution demonstrated in Fig. 7."
11,Conclusions,"In this study, the effect of alkali metals Na and K on the structure-activity relationships of LSCNC perovskite catalyst for HAS was evaluated by systematic characterization of the samples after reduction and reaction. During the reaction, the alkali promoters were found to promote the formation of Co2C species, which suppressed the CO conversion by reducing the available Co0 active sites for CO dissociation. High Co2C/Co0 ratio was essential to improve the higher alcohol distribution, where Co2C serves as the active site for CO insertion. In parallel, the increase of the catalyst basicity by introducing alkali promoters to LSCNC catalyst further facilitated the carbon chain propagation of alcohols, especially for the conversion of methanol to ethanol. Relative to Na-LSCNC, K-promoted catalyst is much more favorable for HAS at 325 °C, with the maximum higher alcohol distribution of 82.2% and the chain-growth probability α of 0.53 given its high Co2C/Co ratio and high basicity. At a higher reaction temperature of 340 °C, K promoter played a protective role in preventing the carbon deposition over the catalyst surface, which is the main reason behind the deactivation of the LSCNC catalyst."
