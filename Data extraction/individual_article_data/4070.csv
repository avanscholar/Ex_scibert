0,Introduction,"Polymer nanocomposites have emerged during the last few decades as promising materials for many different technological applications, including water/air remediation [1,2], solar cells [3], food packaging [4], antimicrobial coatings [5] and bone tissue regeneration [6–8], thanks to their unique and tailored properties. Polymers filling with inorganic nanostructures, such as metals and/or semiconductor oxides, enhances intrinsic properties of the polymer matrix leading to functional nanocomposites with very high surface-to-volume ratio, which often exhibit unique properties, different from conventional composite materials [9–11]. Particularly, a great interest was focused on the possibility to use hydrophilic and biocompatible polymers [12–17] to realize surface coatings on inorganic functional nanoparticles to improve the biocompatibility and colloidal stability in order to favor the formation of hybrid organic/inorganic scaffolds for biomedical applications [14]. Among these polymers, poly-(vinyl alcohol), PVA, is considered a good choice owing to its water-soluble nature and biodegradability [15,13–17]. PVA has been extensively used for drug delivery applications, such as wound dressing and biodegradable scaffolds [18]. Indeed, it presents excellent film forming, good processability, biocompatibility, emulsifying and adhesive properties [19,20]. At the same time, coating of particle surfaces with PVA prevents their agglomeration, giving rise to well-dispersed particles [21]. Several recent studies have reported the use of PVA-based nanocomposites with improved thermal and mechanical stability for various applications [22,23]. Specifically, the rich and widely documented chemistry of biocompatible PVA coatings allows for practical employment of nanoparticles in pharmaceutical and biomedical applications [24,25]. For example, PVA/TiO2 nanocomposites have gained a great attention in the field of tissue engineering [26], thanks to the enhancement in the mechanical strength, thermal behavior and bioactivity due to the presence of TiO2. This one is considered as a valid inorganic substrate which draws over the molecules, proteins, and cells to adhere to its surface, leading to nanocomposites with improved functionality, such as higher tensile strength, good antibacterial action and higher cell proliferation without introducing any toxicity upon their addition in small amounts [27–29]. Coupling inorganic nanoparticles to organic molecules at the molecular level into an organo-inorganic hybrid nanostructure, offers the chance to combine properties of inorganic and organic components into one material and bring unique unexpected features. Among organic components great interest is risen by melanins, an heterogeneous group of polyhydroxyindolic compounds found in all living kingdoms, from the lower level organisms to mammals, being among the most abundant pigments in nature [30]. These pigments are the main responsible for skin, hair, and eye pigmentation, and play a significant role in the protective mechanisms against stress-related DNA damage. Due to their intriguing properties, which include, among the others, broad-spectrum light absorption, radical scavenging, electric conductivity, and paramagnetic behavior, melanins were widely studied in the biomedical field [31]. Recently, many studies proposed that inorganic particles are able to tune the supramolecular structure of melanins thanks to a direct interaction with the melanogenic precursors. It has been recently demonstrated that colloidal TiO2 particles, acting as catalysts and structure directing agents in biopolymers building up, were able to mimic the enzymatic melanogenic processes, driving the oxidative polymerization of 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA) to melanin through DHICA-Ti(IV) ions ligand to metal charge transfer complex (LMCTC) [32], thus ultimately improving their physico-chemical [33–35] and both antioxidant and biocide properties [34,36]. This bioinspired and eco-friendly approach led to hybrid Melanin-TiO2 nanoparticles with unique antimicrobial activity, even under visible light [34,37,38], proposed as promising antibacterial agents for biomedical coatings and food-packaging fields. However, these hybrid nanoparticles showed a very low colloidal stability in aqueous environment, principally due to the high hydrophobic character of melanin pigment. Consequently, they showed a high tendency to self-aggregate and rapidly precipitate, making not easy their use in aqueous medium to produce homogeneous antimicrobial coatings or nanocomposites. In this context, the combination with a hydrophilic polymer matrix, such as PVA, can represent a valid strategy to improve the dispersion of Melanin-TiO2 nanohybrids in aqueous suspension and to favorably create uniform antimicrobial surfaces by spray-coating method. Actually, PVA proved able to control melanin particle size and morphology, by inhibiting their aggregation during synthesis through oxidative polymerization of melanogenic precursors [39,40]. In this work, we propose an in-situ synthetic approach based on the hydrothermal route, by which the hybrid Melanin-TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared mixing both the inorganic and organic precursors in the presence of PVA at different concentrations. The role of PVA in modulating the morphology and size of hybrid Melanin-TiO2 nanoparticles as well as their self-assembly and colloidal stability in aqueous environment was investigated through a combined approach of complementary techniques, including Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Thermal (TG/DSC) analysis, Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). Finally, antibacterial tests were also performed to assess the biocide activity of the obtained nanohybrids against Escherichia Coli bacterial cells to evaluate their biological performances. This study may provide key information on the joint influence of the organic and inorganic components leading to the hybrid nanocomposites on their structural and functional properties, contributing to define a much more far-reaching implementation in the synthesis of bioinspired polymer-based nanomaterials."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA) was synthetized as previously described [41]. Acetic acid, isopropanol anhydrous, PVA (Mw = 31.000–50.000 Da, 98–99 % hydrolyzed), titanium isopropoxide (TTiP) and triethylamine (TEA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy)."
3,Synthesis of hybrid PVA/Melanin-TiO2 nanoparticles,"2.2 Synthesis of hybrid PVA/Melanin-TiO2 nanoparticles Hybrid PVA/Melanin-TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared by a hydrothermal synthetic route inspired by the ones previously carried out for bare TiO2 and Melanin-TiO2 nanoparticles, as reported in literature [34,38]. Specifically, 6 mL of a solution of titanium isopropoxide (TTiP) in anhydrous isopropanol (1.69 M) were added dropwise to 31.3 mL of an aqueous solution of acetic acid (pH = 1.5). The system was kept under stirring for 48 h and a yellowish stable sol formed. Subsequently, appropriate amounts of PVA were independently added to 37.3 mL of the obtained colloidal sol, in order to have specific PVA/DHICA/TTiP ratios, as summarized in Table 1 . Then, each system was kept under stirring for 15 min. Afterwards, 25 mg of DHICA precursor were dissolved into each reaction mixture to guarantee the formation of the melanin-like pigments by Ti(IV) catalyzed oxidative polymerization [32]. The successive neutralization at pH = 7 was realized by dropwise addition of a proper volume of triethylamine. The obtained neutral suspensions were transferred in a Teflon reactor (the liquid filling up to the 75 % of the total volume) and kept at 120 °C for 24 h into a circulating oven. The resulting hybrid nanoparticles were recuperated by centrifugation (at, 11000 rpm, 10 min for each cycle) and washed three times with bi-distilled water. Four PVA/Melanin-TiO2 samples were prepared, only varying the PVA amount added in the reacting mixture, while DHICA and TTIP amounts remained constant. Melanin-TiO2 nanoparticles without PVA were also prepared as reference. Obtained samples were named hereafter Mel-TiO2, PVA(1)/Mel-TiO2, PVA(10)/Mel-TiO2, PVA(20)/Mel-TiO2 and PVA(50)/Mel-TiO2 respectively, as function of PVA concentration in the reacting mixture reported, for simplicity, as (mg/mL)×100."
4,Physico-chemical characterization,"2.3 Physico-chemical characterization 2.3.1 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) The morphology of the obtained hybrid nanoparticles was investigated by acquiring TEM images. Samples for TEM analysis were prepared by placing a drop of the hybrid suspensions on one side of the copper grids, 200 mesh with carbon membrane. TEM images were obtained with a Tecnai 20 G2 Cryo-TEM Tomography (Fei Company, Dawson Creek Drive Hillsboro, USA) microscope equipped with an Eagle 2HS camera: HT 120 KV; camera exposure time: 1 s; size 2048 × 2048. 2.3.2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) XRD measurements were performed by a PANalytical diffractometer (Malvern, Worcestershire, United Kingdom) with a nickel filter and CuKα radiation, with a step size of 0.02° and a counting time of 80 s per step to investigate the formation and the properties of TiO2 crystalline phases. The average crystal size ( τ ) was evaluated through the Scherrer formula: τ = K λ β c o s θ where τ is the mean size of the crystallite domains, K is a dimensionless shape factor, λ is the X-ray wavelength, β is the broadening at half the maximum intensity (FWHM), θ is the Bragg angle (in radiant). 2.3.3 Thermal analysis (TG/DSC) The weight loss of the hybrid nanoparticles as well as the nature and temperatures of the various reactions occurring while heating the samples were evaluated by a SDT-Q600 simultaneous TG/DSC thermo-analyzer (TA Instrument, New Castle, DE). Measurements were recorded on 20 mg of each sample in air and N2, from room temperature to 1000 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C × min−1. 2.3.4 Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy The presence of melanin pigment within the hybrid nanoparticles was verified by performing EPR measurements. They were carried out at room temperature by using a Xband (9 GHz) Bruker Elexys E-500 spectrometer (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany), equipped with a super-high sensitivity probe head. Each sample was inserted into flame-sealed glass capillary, which was coaxially allocated in a standard quartz tube (diameter of 4 mm) within the resonance cavity. The measurements were recorded using the following instrumental settings: sweep width of 120 G; modulation frequency of 100 kHz; modulation amplitude of 1.0 G and resolution of 1024 points. The amplitude of the field modulation was preventively checked to be low enough to avoid detectable signal over-modulation. EPR spectra of nanohybrids were registered with a microwave power of 0.06 mW to avoid microwave saturation of resonance absorption curve and 16 scans were accumulated to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Power saturation (PS) curves were also recorded by varying the microwave power from 0.004 mW to 128 mW. The spectra quantitative analysis (i.e. g-factor and spin-density values) was realized by means of an internal standard composed by Mn2+/MgO powder, introduced in the quartz tube co-axially with the analyzed samples [42]. The signal line width, ΔB, was measured as peak-to-peak distance of the first-derivative signal (instrumental output). 2.3.5 Dynamic light scattering (DLS) DLS measurements were performed to measure the size of hybrid nanoparticles with a home-made instrument composed of a Photocor compact goniometer (Moscow, Russia), a SMD 6000 Laser Quantum 50 mW light source (Laser Quantum, Fremont, CA, USA) operating at 532.5 Å, a photomultiplier (PMT-120-OP/B) and a correlator (Flex02−01D) from Correlator.com (Shenzhen, China). The experiments were carried out at the constant temperature (25.0 ± 0.1) °C, by using a thermostatic bath, and at the scattering angle θ of 90°. The scattered intensity correlation function was analyzed using a regularization algorithm [43]. The diffusion coefficient of each population of diffusing particles was calculated as the z-average of the diffusion coefficients of the corresponding distributions [44]. 2.3.6 Antibacterial activity The antimicrobial activity of Mel-TiO2 and PVA/Mel-TiO2 nanoparticles was valuated against Escherichia coli DH5α. TiO2 nanoparticles were also tested as reference. A single colony of the considered strain was resuspended in 5 mL of Luria-Bertani (LB) broth and incubated overnight at 37 °C. When the culture reached an OD600 of 1 unit, it was diluted 1:100 in 20 mM NaP buffer at pH 7.0. Samples were prepared by adding 20 μL of the volume of bacterial cells and PVA/Mel-TiO2 suspensions were used at fixed concentrations of 200 μg/mL, 500 μL final volume was reached with 20 mM NaP buffer at pH 7.0 [45]. Negative control was represented by cells without nanoparticles. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h, two dilutions (1:100 and 1:1000) of all the samples were placed on solid medium LB agar and incubated overnight at 37 °C. After 24 h surviving cells were estimated by colony counting on each plate and compared with the controls. Standard deviations were less than 5% for each experiment, which was performed at least in triplicate."
5,Results and discussion,
6,TEM analysis,"3.1 TEM analysis TEM images confirmed the formation of PVA/Mel-TiO2 hybrid nanoparticles and shed light on their morphology and size. As shown in Fig. 1 A-D, very small spherical-like nanoparticles of few nanometers (∼5−10 nm) were obtained for all systems that tend to self-aggregate forming not-ordered clusters. Particularly, a light shell was clearly observable around the big clusters of both PVA(20)/Mel-TiO2 and PVA(50)/Mel-TiO2 samples. This shell can be attributed to the PVA which coats these disordered clusters. On the other hand, it was not possible to appreciate the presence of the shell in the samples prepared with a lower polymer content. By the comparison of TEM images acquired at a major magnification, it was possible to note that primary Mel-TiO2 nanoparticles obtained in the presence of PVA at lower content (1, 10 and 20) appeared slightly smaller with respect to bare Mel-TiO2 nanoparticles (Fig. 1 E-G), although no significant differences were observed in the morphology. Indeed, the typical quasi-spherical morphology with a size of ∼10 nm was observed, feasibly caused by the preferential growth of along specific planes during the formation of hybrid nanoparticles, accordingly to our previous evidences [37,46]. On the other hand, in the case of PVA(50)/Mel-TiO2, irregular nanoparticles of greater size (between 25 and 50 nm) were observed. This could be related to the greater viscosity of the reaction solvent in which the nanoparticles formed, which was mainly composed by a high PVA amount (see Table 1), thus influencing the morphology and size of final hybrid nanoparticles. However, TEM images clearly confirmed that, in all cases, the presence of PVA did not hinder the formation of PVA/Mel-TiO2 nanoparticles while their size and subsequently self-assembly appeared influenced by the polymer amount used for the synthesis. These results seem to suggest that PVA, even at low concentrations, was able to tune, either by physical or covalent constraints [39], the hierarchical organization of Mel-TiO2 nanoparticles, which probably resulted covered by a thin PVA layer. More specifically, this effect appeared much clear in the case of PVA(20)/Mel-TiO2 and PVA(50)/Mel-TiO2 samples."
7,XRD analysis,"3.2 XRD analysis XRD patterns of Mel-TiO2 and PVA/Mel-TiO2 nanoparticles were acquired to mainly confirm the formation of TiO2-based nanoparticles, also providing information about their crystalline structure in dependence of PVA content. As shown in Fig. 2 , the diffraction patterns of all samples showed the typical profile of standard anatase lattice [47], both in terms of peak positions (i.e. the diffraction angles, 2θ) and relative intensities, as confirmed by the comparison with pure anatase TiO2 XRD pattern [47]. These experimental evidences confirmed the formation of crystallized TiO2 about 7.5 nm in mean crystalline size, as determined by the Scherrer equation, indicating that the formation of TiO2-based nanoparticles during the hydrothermal treatment was not hindered by the PVA presence, even when it was present in very high nominal amounts, as for PVA(50)/Mel-TiO2."
8,TG/DSC analysis,"3.3 TG/DSC analysis A simultaneous thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry (TG/DSC) analysis was performed to evaluate the presence of the organic components within the hybrid nanoparticles. TG and DSC curves recorded in air in the temperature range of 25−1000 °C are reported in Fig. 3 . For all PVA/Mel-TiO2 samples, a weight loss of about 8−10 wt.% was observed in TG curves (Fig. 3A) in the range of 200−400 °C due to the decomposition of organic fraction, constituted by PVA and melanin which were not directly distinguishable. These evidences confirmed that no differences in the thermal behavior were returned by the hybrid nanoparticles prepared in different reacting conditions, above all in terms of PVA content. Consequently, the estimated percentages of organic component obtained by TG seem to suggest that the increased nominal PVA amounts used for the synthesis did not determine the adsorption of a much greater content of the polymer on the final nanoparticles: most of it was probably washed away, while only a small fraction remained adsorbed, making a thin layer covering the particles. In order to better evaluate the contribution of PVA presence to the thermal behavior of PVA/Mel-TiO2 nanoparticles, their DSC profiles (shown in Fig. 3B) were compared to which obtained for bare PVA and PVA submitted to hydrothermal treatment in the absence of TiO2 and melanin precursors, as reported in Fig. 3 C. Particularly, DSC curve of pure PVA showed a first endothermic peak at 225 °C (Fig. 3C, curve a), due to melting of crystalline fraction in the polymer [48], which was followed by several small exothermic peaks due to oxidative pyrolysis of PVA. This usually occurred in the temperature range 200−500 °C, as also evidenced by mass loss in TG, through three different steps and resulting into three slope changes in TG curve (Fig. 3C, curve a), corresponding to three different exothermic peaks in DSC profile [49]. Then, in order to assess whether any degradation occurred to PVA during nanoparticles synthesis, samples of bare PVA were submitted to hydrothermal treatment in solutions containing acetic acid and TEA, then analyzed through simultaneous TG/DSC analysis. As shown in Fig. 3C, the obtained curves proved that the degradation occurred in the same temperature ranges, suggesting that solvothermal process did not particularly altered PVA composition. Furthermore, a small endothermic peak could be appreciated in DSC profile (Fig. 3D, curve b), proving the partial crystalline nature of PVA recovered after hydrothermal process. In contrast, the melting peak was no longer evident in DSC profiles of hybrid nanoparticles (Fig. 3B), showing a flat baseline in the range 210−230 °C, even at the highest nominal PVA content corresponding to PVA(50)/Mel-TiO2 sample (Fig. 3D, curve c). This evidence suggests that the small amount of PVA wrapping hybrid nanoparticles, as evidenced by TEM images, was probably amorphous. Actually, the presence of hydrogen bonds between OH groups in PVA and those in hybrid Melanin/TiO2 nanoparticles must obstacle chains mobility, hindering their reorganization and, as a consequence, PVA crystallization [48]. Moreover, similarly to that of bare PVA, DSC thermograms of hybrid nanoparticles showed a broad exothermic peak (Fig. 3D), due to the oxidative decomposition of organic moieties, including PVA and melanin. However, DSC exothermic peaks showed a different profile. These results suggested that overall amount of organic phase in the samples is constant and keeps in the range 8−10 wt.% as evaluated by TG curve. Yet, the composition of organic phase changed in the investigated samples: it was expected that the relative ratio of melanin and PVA composing the organic phase decreased as PVA amount increased. Indeed, DSC exothermic peaks of oxidative decomposition fall a lower temperature than those of bare PVA, signifying a lower stability of the polymer."
9,EPR analysis,"3.4 EPR analysis The chemical nature of melanin pigments within the hybrids nanoparticles were confirmed by EPR measurements, which were recorded following an experimental procedure recently defined [34,50], providing significant information on the chemical and supramolecular properties of the hybrid nanomaterials. As shown in Fig. 4 A, EPR spectra of Mel-TiO2 and PVA/Mel-TiO2 nanoparticles presented a similar single and roughly symmetric peak at a g-factor of ∼2.0035, typical hallmark of carbon-centered radicals generated during the oxidative polymerization to melanin and melanin-like pigments, accordingly to previous studies [34,37]. This result univocally confirmed the presence of melanin pigment within the final hybrid nanoparticles. On the other hands, no signals were observed for bare PVA and TiO2, checking the absence of radical species in both the polymer backbone and in the inorganic lattice. A deeper investigation of EPR spectra was realized by the quantitative determination of the signal amplitude, ΔB, directly determined by the line-width of EPR signal, as shown in Fig. 4 A. This peak line-width depends on the relaxation time of spinning electrons and, in the case of aromatic compounds, it is principally affected by the unresolved hyperfine interaction of unpaired electrons with the neighboring aromatic H-atoms [50]. Generally, the broadening of signal lineshape (ΔB increase) is mainly due to the superposition of multiple signals associated to the presence of different paramagnetic species, while the narrowing of peak lineshape (ΔB decrease) is related to the presence of stronger electron-electron interactions and associated to a more locally-ordered organization of the polyaromatic structures hosting unpaired electrons. For this reason, this parameter is usually considered indicative of the mean distance between the radical centers, furnishing an indirect information about the organization of the melanin pigment within the hybrid nanoparticles [34,50]. As reported in Table 2 , the ΔB values corresponding to PVA/Mel-TiO2 spectra resulted lower than that determined for Mel-TiO2 sample (5.0 ± 0.2 G), and the reduction was directly proportionate to the increase of nominal PVA amount. This effect can be mainly associated to a different spatial distribution of the radical centres of melanin, which resulted further away and probably confined in a more locally-ordered region within the hybrid nanoparticles. However, this ΔB reduction appeared particularly pronounced in the case of PVA(50)/Mel-TiO2. It could be explained as due by to a different local-organization of the polyaromatic chains formed within the hybrid nanoparticles, which can be indirectly related to the different size shown by the hybrid nanoparticles formed in the presence of a greater nominal amount of PVA, as detected by TEM images. Then, the EPR analysis was completed by building the power saturation (PS) curves in which the normalized peak amplitude (A/A0) was plotted as function of the square root of the microwave power (P), as shown in Fig. 4 B. These curves were got by analyzing EPR spectra of each sample recorded by increasing the incident microwave power. A decrease in amplitude for higher microwave powers was observed for bare DHICA-melanin, indicating that free radicals presented long relaxation times and were homogeneously located in the pigment. Instead, PVA/Mel-TiO2 samples showed a monotonic increase, accordingly to that observed for bare Mel-TiO2, indicating that all free radical spins did not exhibit the same relaxation behavior and saturated independently. This result confirmed that radical centers present a similar chemical inhomogeneous distribution for all PVA/Mel-TiO2 nanoparticles, as a consequence of the presence of different aromatic moieties on which the unpaired electrons were stabilized. It was also in agreement with the behavior exerted by bare Mel-TiO2 nanoparticles, as previously observed [34,37]. Finally, any change was observed in the values of spin-density (Table 2) of PVA/Mel-TiO2 nanoparticles with respect to bare Mel-TiO2 ones, thus definitely confirming that the presence of PVA within the reaction environment did not hinder the oxidative polymerization of DHICA into melanin and, furthermore, did not alter its polymerization grade. Although previous solid-state NMR spectra on bare Mel-TiO2 nanoparticles allowed to describe the C signal distribution associate to the redox state of the biomacromolecule [37], the large amount of PVA used in this work hindered the NMR analysis. However, EPR was suitable to confirm that no change or alteration of the oxidation state occurred in the pigment."
10,DLS distribution curves,"3.5 DLS distribution curves The behavior of PVA/Mel-TiO2 nanoparticles in aqueous suspension was also investigated by DLS, obtaining information about both the size in dependence of PVA content and the role of polymer matrix in modulating their colloidal stability. Given that the all suspensions were dilute, the Stokes-Einstein equation was used to evaluate the hydrodynamic radius, R H , of the aggregates from their translation diffusion coefficient, D: (1) R H = k T 6 π η 0 D where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature and η0 = 0.89 cP is the solvent viscosity. For non-spherical particles, R H represents the radius of a spherical aggregate with the same diffusion coefficient. First of all, a suspension of bare Mel-TiO2 nanoparticles, considered as reference, was inspected by DLS. However, the analysis was not easily performed, due to the high instability showed by these nanoparticles in aqueous environment which caused a fast aggregation process, as proved by the appearance of multiple populations in the DLS curve (Fig. 5, c urve a), also bringing to a rapid precipitation. Differently, hybrid PVA/Mel-TiO2 nanoparticles were smoothly analyzed, thanks to a greater colloidal stability exhibited in aqueous environment, and just conferred by the PVA which drastically reduced the tendency of hybrid nanoparticles to quickly precipitate because of the high hydrophobic character of melanins. As reported in Fig. 5 curves b-e, DLS analysis of PVA/Mel-TiO2 suspensions showed bi-modal distribution curves, indicating the presence of two population with different sizes: a first population was centered at R H values of about 100 ± 10 nm, regularly observed for all PVA/Mel-TiO2 suspensions and probably ascribable to the small nanoparticles self-aggregates; the second one was referred to greater particles with R H values included in the range of 450−1000 nm, which dimensions were strongly dependent on the increase of the nominal PVA amount used during the synthesis. Accordingly to TEM evidences, both these populations can be ascribed to the presence of clusters formed by the self-assembly of the small primary Mel-TiO2 nanoparticles, which were presumably coated by the thin shell of PVA. However, the presence of increased PVA amounts during the synthesis favored the formation of bigger clusters that, in the case of PVA(50)/Mel-TiO2, became particularly large. These results confirmed that the key role of PVA in tuning the self-assembly of primary Mel-TiO2 nanoparticles, in which the formation of larger particles was favored by the presence of high PVA amounts within the reacting mixture. More specifically, this behavior could be related to the increase in the viscosity of the reaction solvent induced by the high PVA content, in which the hybrid nanoparticles formed, that reduced their mobility leading to a greater proximity between Mel-TiO2 nanoparticles and resulting in the creation of larger aggregates. On the other hand, it is also conceivably to consider that, at high PVA concentrations, the enthalpic contribution of the polymer-polymer interactions was more significant in driving the aggregation process with respect to the case of synthesis realized in the presence of lower PVA content, where the contribution of the particles-particles was predominant. This greater tendency of the PVA chains to interact with each other could have determined the formation of the thin polymeric shell in such a way as to incorporate a greater number of nanoparticles, leading to larger final clusters."
11,Antibacterial activity results,"3.6 Antibacterial activity results Biological assays were performed to test the antibacterial properties of the hybrid PVA/Mel-TiO2 nanoparticles. Biocide activity of TiO2, Mel-TiO2 and PVA/Mel-TiO2 was tested against Escherichia coli DH5α cells. A suspension of nanoparticles at a concentration of 200 μg/mL was added to the bacterial cell cultures. As shown in Fig. 6 , the antimicrobial activity of the samples decreases as the poly-(vinyl alcohol) percentage increases. Compared to the positive control, consisting of the Mel-TiO2 nanoparticles, which - as reported from previous studies [34] - have a strong antimicrobial activity, all samples with PVA exhibited less antimicrobial activity. However, the PVA(1)/Mel-TiO2 and PVA(10)/Mel-TiO2 samples still maintain good antimicrobial properties against the indicator strain: 25 and 35 % of bacterial cell survival, respectively. This progressive and monotonic decrease in the antimicrobial activity can be associated to the effect of PVA in modifying the self-assembly of Mel-TiO2 nanoparticles and is notably paired by the trend of sizes observed by DLS analysis. Indeed, it was plausible to imagine that the presence of the polymer coating around the Mel-TiO2 clusters determined two principal effects on the biological activity. From a first point of view, the formation of great clusters entrapped by polymer shell reduced the number of exposed “acting sites”, represented by primary hybrid TiO2-Mel nanoparticles which were able to exert their antibacterial activity by generating Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), as previously demonstrated by our research group [38]. At the same time, the presence of PVA can reduce the adhesion property of hybrid Mel-TiO2 nanoparticles that, in combination to the capability in ROS production, is a fundamental feature of these nanomaterials to cause the bacterial membrane disruption and the subsequent cells death [38]. Both these two effects, evidenced by physico-chemical results, could synergistically hinder the cell wall destabilization, leading to a partially loss of the biocide activity."
12,Conclusions,"We have investigated the effect of poly-vinyl-alcohol (PVA) on the formation and the antibacterial activity of Melanin-TiO2 nanoparticles synthetized through a bioinspired hydrothermal route. Experimental results indicated that the PVA addition in the reacting mixture did not hinder the formation of small Mel-TiO2 nanoparticles of about 10−20 nm in size and, regardless of the nominal amount used for the synthesis, only a small amount remained adsorbed, forming a thin layer around the clusters of the primary Mel-TiO2 nanoparticles. However, this amount was enough to improve the colloidal stability in aqueous medium of the hybrid nanoparticles, thus preventing their precipitation. On the other hand, the diverse initial PVA concentrations strongly influenced the self-assembly of the hybrid nanoparticles, inducing the formation of clusters whose dimensions enhanced with the nominal PVA amount. This effect was probably due to the different viscosity of reaction solvent, caused by the increasing concentrations of PVA, which drove the self-assembly of Mel-TiO2 nanoparticles into great aggregates. Although according to opposite direction, a similar monotonic trend was also observed for antibacterial assays: a decrease in the biocide activity of PVA/Mel-TiO2 nanoparticles against Escherichia coli bacterial cultures was observed proportionally to the PVA amount used for the synthesis. This effect was probably associated to both a loss of the adhesive properties of hybrid nanostructures against bacterial cells as well as to a reduced exposure of the “acting sites” represented by primary hybrid TiO2-Mel nanoparticles entrapped by PVA into large clusters, thus limiting their antibacterial action. However, the partial reduction of the antimicrobial activity in the presence of small polymer amount was compensated by a greater dispersion of the hybrid nanoparticles, making them suitable to realize antibacterial surface coatings through spray-coating method as well as to produce biocompatible polymeric films or scaffolds with enhanced biocide properties for biomedical applications."
