0,Introduction,"Hydrogen energy is a promising alternative renewable energy source in the twenty-first century [1]. The production of H2 can be achieved by various chemical and biological conversions [2]. However, H2 generation via photocatalytic water splitting could be an effective sustainable approach as it has higher efficiency, low costs, and zero emissions [3,4]. Different strategies, such as surface modification, hybridization, doping, and bandgap engineering, have been developed for sun light induced hydrogen evolution [5–15]. Besides, different noble and rare earth metals have also been used as co−catalysts to improve H2 generation [16–19]. For example, Yan and Zhang et al. reported a Pt-loaded g−C3N4 and TiO2 hybrid for H2 production from water splitting [16,17]. Recently, a photo-deposited Rh-supported g−C3N4 system for effective H2 generation [18] was also reported by Zhang et al. Moreover, Fan and co−workers have synthesized silver deposited iron and nickel doped TiO2 for H2 production [19]. Although many improvements in H2 production (μmol level) have been achieved in recent decades, more efforts need to be made for further enhancement of the H2 generation efficiency (up to the mmol level) via the photocatalytic approach. Zinc oxide (ZnO) has been proved as an effective photo−catalyst because of excellent activity, stability, unique property and ease of synthesis [20–22]. It also possesses adequate valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) energy to split water into hydrogen. However, ZnO is UV−active, and thus, cannot utilize the more abundant natural sunlight, thereby limiting its practical application. Thus far, numerous metals have been doped into ZnO to make them an effective catalyst under visible light [23–25]. However, research has not been conducted to study the doping of rare earth metals especially samarium (Sm+3) into the ZnO crystal lattice, and the application of Sm+3 in photocatalytic H2 evolution also has not been tested [26]. Graphitic−C3N4 is widely accepted as photocatalyst for hydrogen production due to their appropriate VB and CB potential energy [16–18,27]. The CB band of ZnO possesses lower energy compared to g−C3N4. Hence, the utilization of Sm doped−ZnO and g−C3N4 could exert high photo activity owing to their synergistic effect, and proper matching of VB and CB potential which could allow higher charge separation through the heterojunction. Though ZnO and g−C3N4 are one of the most effective photocatalysts, an effective way to prepare their composites for the effective production of H2 under visible light by utilizing their synergism is not extensively studied [28,29]. In our present work, the rare earth metal, Sm+3 is doped into the ZnO lattice through a novel wet chemical way. Here, the role of Sm+3 is that it helps ZnO to absorb light in the visible spectrum as well as acting as a co−catalyst (scavenger for electrons) inhibiting electron–hole recombination. Furthermore, different weight percentages of Sm−doped ZnO are incorporated with g−C3N4 via facile calcination to generate novel SAZOC composites for further enhancement of H2 evolution. To the best of our knowledge, the doping of Sm+3 into ZnO and the preparation of SAZOC composites in this facile route is novel and their application for H2 generation reaction has not been studied previously. Finally, a photocatalytic mechanism over SAZOC is also proposed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Melamine, Zinc acetate tetra-hydrate [Zn(OAc)2.4H2O] and Samarium acetate hexahydrate [Sm(OAc)3.6H2O] were bought from Duksan Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd. (Ansan city, South Korea). Terephthalic acid was obtained from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Lactic acid and all other analytical grade (99.9%) solvents were obtained from Sigma Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, Missouri, USA)."
3,Preparation of Sm−doped ZnO/g−C3N4 (SAZOC) composite,"2.2 Preparation of Sm−doped ZnO/g−C3N4 (SAZOC) composite First, Sm−doped ZnO was synthesized following a modified wet chemical route [30]. Typically, zinc acetate (122.6 mg, 0.048 mmol) and samarium acetate (4.4 mg, 0.001 mmol) were mixed in minimum amount (6 mL) of DMF before adding of terephthalic acid (58.1 mg, 0.035 mmol) into the solution. Within a minute, the Sm−Zn-based metal–organic hybrid (MOH) was formed at room temperature by a self−assembly process, and stirring was continued for 10 min. The products were centrifuged and washed with acetonitrile (10 mL), and dried at 25 °C. Finally, the as−prepared Sm−Zn−based MOH was heated for 4 h at 600 °C to obtain Sm−doped ZnO. The minimum temperature needed for calcination to obtain metal oxides from metal organic hybrid was around 550 °C [7]. So, little higher temperature (600 °C) was chosen for the generation of Sm−doped ZnO from Sm−Zn−based MOH. Different proportions (5, 10, and 15, wt.%) of as−synthesized Sm−doped ZnO were mixed with melamine (3.0 g) in a mortar, ground for 10 min, and then subjected to calcination at 520 °C for 2 h in air to get the SAZOC composite. The heating of melamine above 520 °C could result the loss of the sample; hence this was the limiting temperature chosen for the synthesis of the composite. A sample of pure g−C3N4 without Sm−doped ZnO was also prepared from melamine by the similar process. The SAZOC composites obtained by combining 5, 10, and 15% Sm–doped ZnO with g−C3N4 are denoted as SAZOC5, SAZOC10 and SAZOC15, respectively. The overall procedure for synthesizing the SAZOC composites is schematically presented in Fig. 1 ."
4,Photocatalytic H2 generation from water,"2.3 Photocatalytic H2 generation from water The generation of hydrogen was performed according to a previous report [31] in an air tight quartz reactor. At first, lactic acid (acts as a sacrificial agent) solution 5% (v) was added (7.5 mL) with 150 mL water. A particular amount of prepared catalysts (5.0 mg) was added into it, and was sealed properly. To eliminate the dissolved gases, the solution was vacuumed and nitrogen was passed into it. After stirring of the solution (20 min), visible light was irradiated (λ ≥ 420 nm, 150 W LED, 7.6 mW/cm2). Finally, photo−generated hydrogen was taken out by a syringe (150 mL) and measured with a gas chromatograph (TCD detector and Helium carrier gas). The apparent quantum yield (AQY) for H2 generation was measured by Equation (1). (1) A Q Y ( % ) = 2 × n u m b e r o f p r o d u c e d h y d r o g e n m o l e c u l e s n u m b e r o f i n c i d e n t p h o t o n s × 100 Two electrons required (2 e−) to generate each H2 molecule, which was also considered."
5,Characterization techniques,"2.4 Characterization techniques Powder X−ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis of the SAZOC catalysts was performed using an X’pert Pro MPD PANalytical 2-circle X-ray diffractometer (Netherlands) equipped with a Cu-Kα radiation source (wavelength = 0.154 nm, and power capability of 2.2 kW and 60 kV) to confirm the internal structure and composite formation. Sample scanning was carried out within 2θ range of 10–80°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted using Thermo Kα equipment (ESCALAB 250 XPS System, Thermo Fisher Scientific, U.K.) with a monochromatic Al-Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV). “AVANTAGE” software was used for XPS fitting with a Shirley subtraction and Gaussian–Lorentzian shape was used for the deconvolution. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used for determination of size, shape and microstructural characteristics of SAZOC composites, which was analyzed by a Tecnai G2 F20 STWIN transmission electron microscope (USA) with an operating voltage of 200 kV. The samples were dispersed in alcohol and drop casted onto the carbon coated copper grid and then dried. High angle annular dark field (HAADF) mapping was done by selecting a particular area of the composite during the capturing of TEM images. The images were taken at around 700,000 × magnification. The surface textures and morphologies of the composites were determined using a S−4800 (Hitachi Ltd., Japan) field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) with an acceleration voltage of 5 kV. Prior to analysis, the samples were gold coated. The images were captured at magnification of around 20,000 × to 70, 000 × . Optical analysis was done by Kimon (Japan) photoluminescence spectrometer at excitation wavelength of 365 nm, within spectral range of 400–600 nm. UV-Vis DRS measurement was carried out by a UV–Vis–NIR double beam spectrophotometer (VARIAN, Cary 5000, USA) equipped with a diffuse reflectance measuring unit, in the spectral range of 200–800 nm."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of the SAZOC composites,"3.1 Characterization of the SAZOC composites The internal structure of the prepared composites is verified by PXRD technique. PXRD patterns of pure Sm doped−ZnO and SAZOC composites are shown in Fig. 2 . The PXRD confirms the formation of hexagonal wurtzite phase [32] of the ZnO (JCPDS card: 36−1451) indicating successful transformations of Sm−Zn−based metal organic hybrid into Sm doped−ZnO. The highest intensity peak was found along (101) plane indicating that growth of the ZnO crystal occurred in this direction. XRD does not show any peaks related to Sm+2 and Sm+3 species (oxides) confirming the Sm+3 doping (0.5%, wt.) in the ZnO. For the SAZOC composites, XRD pattern shows a broad peak at 27.5° for (002) plane, generally observed due to the presence of planar C−N hetero−cycles of the g−C3N4 nanosheet [33]. The intensity of (002) plane (at 2θ = 27.5°) of g−C3N4 is somewhat decreased for SAZOC15 (85% g−C3N4, wt. %) compared to SAZOC5 (95% g−C3N4, wt. %) and SAZOC10 (90% g−C3N4, wt. %), which might be due to the decrease of g−C3N4 content in the SAZOC15 sample. The peaks related to Sm doped−ZnO are also observed in all the composites. The intensity of ZnO peaks (100, 002, 101) of SAZOC 15 is slightly increased due to increase of ZnO content (15%, wt.%) in the sample compared to SAZOC5 (5%, wt.%), indicating successful incorporation of the Sm doped−ZnO with g−C3N4 in the SAZOC composites. No peaks are found to be shifted in the SAZOC composites, signifying no change in the internal structure of Sm doped−ZnO after formation of the composites. Moreover, peaks related to impurities are also not noticed, which signifies good purity in the composites. The surface composition in the SAZOC composite and doping of Sm+3 into the ZnO lattice are confirmed by XPS. The XPS of the SAZOC10 has been shown in Fig. 2. The XPS survey spectrum of the SAZOC10 (Fig. 3 a) confirms the existence of Zn, O, C, and N in the composite, and no impurity peaks were observed. The peak related to Sm+3 is also observed from the XPS of Sm 3 d in SAZOC10. Two sharp peaks are observed at 1111.0 eV and 1083.7 eV for the Sm 3 d (Fig. 3b), confirming the doping of Sm+3 into the ZnO in the SAZOC10 [34]. The XPS profile (Fig. 3c) also exhibits peak related to the C 1s (287.5 eV) due to the presence of Sp2 carbon linked with nitrogen in the g−C3N4. In addition, the peaks between 398.20 and 400.80 eV can be attributed to N present in different carbon environments (C=N−C, N−(C)3 and N−H) in the g−C3N4 (Fig. 3d) for the SAZOC10 sample [33]. The XPS of Zn 2p exhibits (Fig. 3e) peaks at 1021.61 and 1044.60 eV, with a splitting of around ∼23.0 eV, indicating a normal (+2) state of Zn in the sample [32]. XPS also confirms the presence of two types of oxygen in the sample. The peaks for O 1s are observed at 528.8 and 530.8 eV, due to lattice oxygen and surface hydroxyl (Fig. 3f) present in the composite [32]. Moreover, the shifting of the N and C peaks to slightly higher binding energy compared to pure g−C3N4 [8] indicates charge transfer interaction between the carbon nitride and doped−zinc oxide. Therefore, the formation, interaction and the heterojunction of SAZOC catalyst is successfully confirmed by XPS. The SAZOC composites are further characterized by Raman spectroscopy to find the interaction between g−C3N4 and ZnO, as shwon in Fig. 4. It is observed that pure ZnO shows two low intense peaks at 325, 385 and 540 cm−1 and a characteristic sharp peak at 446 cm−1 . However, the peaks of ZnO are overlapped with the peaks of g−C3N4 and become wider and strong in the SAZOC composites. The ZnO peak at 446 cm−1 become red shifted to 458-490 cm−1 with increase of ZnO content in the SAZOC composites owing to proper hybridization and interaction with g−C3N4. Furthermore, the peaks at 310 and 550, 630 cm−1 of the SAZOC5 are red shifted to 320, 570 and 655 cm−1, respectively in the SAZOC15. Besides, the small peak at 385 cm−1 of the ZnO is still observed in the SAZOC composites. UV−Visible−DRS of SAZOC composites clearly shows (Fig. 5 ) that the shifting of absorption band of pure ZnO from the UV region (∼408 nm) to the visible region (∼422 nm) after doping with Sm+3. The result further indicates successful insertion of Sm+3 into the crystal lattice of ZnO. Since g−C3N4 has a strong visible light absorption capacity; hence, all the composites exhibit higher visible light absorption compared to Sm doped−ZnO. However, owing to the increase of ZnO content in the SAZOC samples, the visible absorption edges is blue shifted from ∼540 nm to ∼500 nm. The surface texture and morphology of the composites are explored by TEM and FESEM study. FESEM images of the SAZOC composites are presented in Fig. 6 . For Sm doped−ZnO sample, the average size of agglomerated cubic shaped ZnO was found to be ∼30 nm. FESEM images of the SAZOC show (Fig. 6b−d) that the Sm doped−ZnO are nicely distributed on the g−C3N4 nanosheet surface. It is also noticed that introducing ZnO with the g−C3N4, the surface becomes rough, which is also consistent with TEM. TEM images (Fig. 7 a−c) clearly show the rough texture of SAZOC10 due to the wrapped ZnO nanoparticles into the g−C3N4 sheet. This type of rough texture is generally expected to exhibit good catalytic activity. Fig. 7d shows the elemental mapping of a particular area from TEM images of SAZOC10, which confirms the elemental composition of zinc, oxygen, carbon and nitrogen with proper ratios in the sample due to existence of g−C3N4 and ZnO in the sample. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the SAZOC composites, obtained from TEM images, show rings of bright spots due to ZnO, indicating crystalline nature of SAZOC composites (Supporting Information, Fig. S1). However, another set of isolated dots are also observed in the pattern due to g−C3N4 sheet. A distinct heterojunction is formed between the Sm−doped ZnO and g−C3N4, as confirmed by high resolution TEM image of the SAZOC10 (Fig. 8 a). A clear lattice fringe line (0.26 nm) is observed due to (101) plane of ZnO present in the sample [35]. Hence, TEM study successfully demonstrates the surface morphology and the formation of a heterojunction, which is good agreement with the XPS. Photoluminescence (PL) is measured at 365 nm (excitation wavelength) to confirm the charge transfer in the SAZOC composites through the heterojunction. It is known that the electron−hole recombination is responsible for getting PL spectra [8]. Therefore, high intense PL spectra are expected for higher charge recombination [36,37]. Fig. 8b exhibits PL of the SAZOC composites and g−C3N4. The pure g−C3N4 shows highly intense PL emission at 463 nm, whereas lower PL intensity is obtained for the SAZOC composites. The PL intensity is significantly decreased for the SAZOC10 and SAZOC15, suggesting lower recombination of electron–hole take place for these composites, hence, more charge separation occurs through the heterojunction. The elemental composition of Sm, Zn, O, C and N in the SAZOC composites is further analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. Fig. 9 shows the EDX analysis of the three SAZOC composites obtained from TEM, confirming the elemental composition of samarium, zinc, oxygen, carbon and nitrogen present in the samples. The Sm content in all the composites varied between 0.56 and 0.67%, which is close to 0.5%, used for the preparation of the composites. Moreover, the total Zn and O contents (wt. %) in the SAZOC composites were found to be 11.1%, 17.4% and 24.3% for SAZOC5, SAZOC10 and SAZOC15, whereas total wt. % of C and N varied from 75.1% (for SAZOC 15) to 88.3% (SAZOC 5) in the composite. The increase in wt. % values of ZnO in the composites is due to weight loss of melamine during calcinations and their transformation to g-C3N4. Therefore, the EDX results confirm the elemental compositions present in the composite, and are consistent with both XPS and XRD."
8,Visible−light assisted H2 generation,"3.2 Visible−light assisted H2 generation Hydrogen generation experiment is conducted with water and lactic acid solutions in presence of the SAZOC catalysts. Before irradiation with LED lamps, nitrogen was passed into the solution and stirred for 20 min. After every 1 h of irradiation, the generated H2 is collected and analyzed by GC. The result of the photocatalytic H2 production over various SAZOC composites is presented in Fig. 10 . The prepared SAZOC composites showed excellent activity towards H2 generation (up to mmol level). Fig. 10a shows the plot of the H2 produced (mmol) per gram of the different catalysts with time, and Fig. 10b shows the comparative rate of H2 production (mmol g−1 h−1) for different catalysts. Hydrogen was produced in quantities of 51.4, 21.7, and 17.3 mmol g−1 in the presence of SAZOC10, SAZOC15, and SAZOC5 after 5 h of photo-irradiation, respectively. For the initial 2 h, no significant change in activity (H2 production rate) is observed for SAZOC composites, however after that the performance is tremendously increased, which might be due to the fact that the generation of charge carriers is not high at the initial hours of reaction. Moreover, the H2 generation rate of SAZOC composites are superior to pure g−C3N4 and Sm doped−ZnO samples, and the SAZOC 10 shows best performance toward H2 generation (10.25 mmol g−1 h−1) from water at the same experimental conditions. The H2 production rate of SAZOC10 is found to be almost five and six folds higher compared to pure g−C3N4 and Sm doped−ZnO, respectively. This type of high H2 generation capacity of a semiconductor photo−catalyst is seldom reported and is superior to many early reported literatures [16–18,38–42]. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) for the H2 generation by SAZOC10 was also measured, which was 3.5% at 420 nm. A comparative H2 production rate of SAZOC 10 with earlier reports is also shown in Table 1 . It is worth to note that the performance of H2 production (in μmol g−1 h−1) by SAZOC 10 catalyst is significantly higher than those of earlier reports on similar g−C3N4–based hybrids. The higher H2 production rate of the SAZOC is due to synergistic effect of Sm doped−ZnO and g−C3N4, and higher charge separation across the heterojunction (indicated by PL study), and also due to the presence of Sm+3, which acts like a co−catalyst for hydrogen production by lowering the charge recombination. It could be expected that higher separation of electrons−holes (as indicated by low PL intensities) of SAZOC10 and SAZOC15 make them superior to SAZOC5 as a catalyst, which is a crucial factor for their enhanced activities. However, the activity of SAZOC 15 is significantly lower compared to SAZOC 10, which is most possibly due to the lower visible light absorption (indicated by UV−DRS) of SAZOC15 compared to SAZOC10 and SAZOC5, making it overall a moderate catalyst for H2 production. The pH of aqueous solution has also an important role in photocatalytic hydrogen generation. The photocatalytic test of SAZOC10 is carried out at different pH of the solution from 2.0 to 8.0 to optimize its performance. It is observed that H2 production performance is significantly decreased with increase of pH (Fig. 11 a). The highest performance is observed at pH 2.0; hence, this was selected for the whole study. The high activity in acidic medium possibly due to presence of higher number of H+ ion in the catalyst surface facilitating more generation of hydrogen. The stability of a photo−catalyst is very essential for H2 evolution reaction. Hence, a stability test is also carried out in the present study (Fig. 11b). The catalysts are continuously irradiated up to 10 h under light and H2 generation rate is measured after every 1 h interval. The results shows that a total of 90.02, 38.7 and 30.3 mmol g−1 H2 production is observed after 10 h of photo−irradiation for SAZOC 10, SAZOC 15 and SAZOC 5 catalysts, respectively. No significant decrease in H2 generation rate is observed up to 8 h; however, a slight decrease in the production rate is noticed after 8 h, which could be possibly due to the leaching of ZnO from the composite for long time exposure of light. Overall, the prepared SAZOC composites are stable enough towards effective production of H2 under light. Based on the results and previous literature [26,43], a photocatalytic mechanism over the SAZOC composite for evolution of hydrogen from water is also proposed in the present study (Fig. 12 ). Both carbon nitride and samarium doped−ZnO can absorb the visible spectrum of light. Hence, upon irradiation of light, the VB electrons of g−C3N4 and Sm doped−ZnO are excited and transits to their CB. The holes (h+) are generated at the VB simultaneously. Since the CB potential of ZnO is situated below the CB potential of g−C3N4, the excited CB electrons of g−C3N4 move to the CB of ZnO through the heterojunction. The dopant Sm3+ in ZnO acts as an electron scavenger on the surface and converts to Sm2+, and thus inhibits the charge−carrier recombination and improves their separation. The produced unstable Sm2+ can easily donates electrons to H+ ion generated from water oxidation by the holes at valence band (g−C3N4) and reduced to H2. At the same time, the generated O2 can be reduced to superoxide radicals (O2 .- ) by CB electrons of g−C3N4, which subsequently converts to OH ˙ radical in the presence of H+ and degrades the lactic acid. The lactic acid supplies electrons to VB of g−C3N4 while its degradation and the cycle continues."
9,Conclusion,"In summary, Sm+3 is successfully doped with ZnO by facile wet chemical route, and also the prepared Sm−doped ZnO are successfully coupled with g−C3N4 at different proportions by the solid state transformation route to obtain various SAZOC composites. The XPS and EDX analysis confirmed the successful doping of Sm+3 into ZnO lattice, which made ZnO to be active under the visible light. TEM confirmed the formation of heterojunction between g−C3N4 and Sm−doped ZnO. The PL measurements suggested the lower electrons–holes recombination and higher charge separation across the heterojunction for the SAZOC composites. All the prepared SAZOC composites show excellent H2 production abilities under solar light, and the SAZOC10 exhibits the highest H2 generation rate (10.25 mmol g−1 h−1) amongst all the composites. The acidic medium (pH 2.0) was highly favourable for the H2 generation over SAZOC composites. Moreover, the SAZOC composites are stable enough and produced 30.3–90.02 mmol g−1 total H2 in 10 h. The high photo−activity of SAZOC composites is due to synergistic presence of highly active ZnO and g−C3N4, and also due to Sm+3, which enhance the charge separation more effectively by acting as co−catalyst for H2 production. Therefore, the prepared SAZOC composites could be a potential candidate for excellent hydrogen production under photo−catalysis in near future, and also could mimic natural photosynthesis."
