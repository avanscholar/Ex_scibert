0,Introduction,"The technologies of selectively catalytic hydrogenation are widely used in petrochemical and chemical industries, such as alkyne hydrogenation [1–3], diene hydrogenation [4,5], unsaturated aldehydes and ketones hydrogenation [6–10], etc. Furfural can be obtained by the hydrolysis of cellulose, which is beneficial to the development and utilization of biomass, thereby alleviating energy problems. After the CC and CO bond in furfural are hydrogenated, a series of side reactions can take place. Selective hydrogenation of furfural is very important and could be applied to produce furfuryl alcohol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, 2-methylfuran, furan and so on [11–15]. Tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol is an important chemical intermediate that can be utilized to synthetize dihydrofuran, lysine, plasticizers, etc. Therefore, it is very necessary to develop an environmentally friendly and efficient catalyst with high selectivity for the production of tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol by furfural selective hydrogenation. Currently, the catalysts used for furfural hydrogenation could be categorized into metal-based catalysts and amorphous alloy catalysts, for example, Pd-, Pt-, Ru-, Rh-, Au-, Co-, Ni-, Cu-, and Fe-based catalysts and multimetallic catalysts [16]. Researchers have found that the multimetallic catalysts exhibited high catalytic performance in the selective hydrogenation of furfural [17–19]. The alloy-based catalysts, which were widely applied in selective hydrogenation of furfural, showed excellent catalytic properties because of the electronic/geometric effects between different metals [20,21]. For most alloy catalysts, they were usually prepared by combining a transition metal with a small amount of precious metal. Pd was often used to synthesize the Pd-M alloy catalysts (M = Ni, Co, Fe, Cu, Pt, Ru, etc.) owing to its excellent catalytic performance in the hydrogenation reactions [22–27]. In addition, the interaction between support and active component could affect the catalytic behaviors of the catalysts [28–30]. Nitrogen doping on the carbon support could reduce the electron spin density of the metallic nanoparticles and improved the oxidation resistance of the metallic nanoparticles. And the interaction between effectiveconstituents and support was enhanced, thus improving the stability of the catalyst in selective hydrogenation of furfural. Puthiaraj et al. used a template method to prepare Pd/NPC catalysts (NPC-nitrogen-doped high-porous carbon), and this catalyst showed 92% conversion of furfural and 84% selectivity to furfuryl alcohol under the following reaction conditions-reaction time (10 h), reaction temperature (120 °C) [31]. However, the accurate mechanism of enhancing the catalytic performance of nitrogen doping catalysts for furfural selective hydrogenation remains to be further studied in depth. Inspired by the influence of the interaction between alloy nanoparticles and support on the catalytic performance of the catalysts for furfural hydrogenation, we prepared the PdNiCo/N-CNTs catalyst (PdNiCo alloy nanoparticles supported on N-CNTs). The catalytic performance of the catalysts was evaluated by furfural hydrogenation reaction. For the PdNiCo/N-CNTs catalyst, because PdNiCo alloy nanoparticles were present, there was electronic synergy effect among Pd, Ni and Co metals. And the PdNiCo alloy nanoparticles would interact with nitrogen-containing groups on the surface of N-CNTs (synergistic effect of electron). The above-mentioned interactions (or synergy effect) affected the features and properties of surface active sites thus determining the catalytic performance of the catalysts. Nanostructures, surface properties and synergy effect in PdNiCo/N-CNTs and other catalysts were detected by some characterization methods, including XRD, TEM, HRTEM, HAADF-STEM, BET, XPS, elemental analysis, STEM-EDS elemental mapping and line-scanning analysis, and Raman spectroscopy. The basicity of the catalysts was analyzed by CO2-TPD. In this investigation, we revealed and discussed the effects of the nanostructure, basicity of the PdNiCo/N-CNTs catalyst and interaction (synergy effect) between PdNiCo alloy nanoparticles and N-CNTs on its catalytic performance."

Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received."
3,Catalyst synthesis,"2.2 Catalyst synthesis Modification of carbon nanotubes: (1) CNTs-unmodified and concentrated nitric acid were placed in a round-bottomed flask and it was heated to reflux at 110 °C for 4 h. Then the mixture was cooled to room temperature, sonicated for 30 min. The solid was collected after being filtered and washed several times. After purification, the carbon nanotubes contained carboxylic groups, etc., signed as CNTs. (2) The carbon nanotubes modified with concentrated nitric acid (CNTs) were uniformly mixed with melamine, and then it was calcined in a N2 flow at 800 °C for 2 h to obtain N-CNTs. The nitrogen content in N-CNTs was 0.6 wt%, which was obtained on an elemental analyzer (elementar vario EL cube). Preparation of monometallic and bimetallic catalysts: a certain volume of aqueous (NH4)2PdCl4 solution (concentration-0.033 mol L-1) was dissolved in the mixture of 75 mL ethylene glycol and 25 mL deionized water, sonicated for 15 min. Then 0.3 g N-CNTs (or CNTs) was added and the ultrasonic dispersion was performed for 15 min. Subsequently, sodium borohydride solution (moles of metal/moles of sodium borohydride = 1:5) was slowly added, stirring for 6 h. The catalyst was collected by filtration, thoroughly washed with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol severaltimes, respectively. Then the catalyst was dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 8 h to obtain Pd/N-CNTs (or Pd/CNTs). The preparation details of bimetallic catalysts were similar to those of monometallic catalysts, the difference was that aqueous (NH4)2PdCl4 solution was replaced with the mixture of a pre-calculated amount of aqueous (NH4)2PdCl4 solution and NiCl2·6H2O (or CoCl2·6H2O). Then we obtained PdNi/N-CNTs (or PdNi/CNTs, PdCo/N-CNTs, PdCo/CNTs). Preparation of the trimetallic catalysts: The catalysts were prepared by sodium borohydride reduction method. A pre-calculated amount of aqueous (NH4)2PdCl4 solution, NiCl2·6H2O and CoCl2·6H2O were dissolved in the mixture of 75 mL ethylene glycol and 25 mL deionized water, and ultrasonic for 15 min to obtain a homogeneous mixed solution. 0.6 g N-CNTs (CNTs) was placed into the above solution, under ultrasonic dispersion for 15 min, then sodium borohydride solution (molar mass of metal/molar mass of sodium borohydride = 1:5) was slowly added, stirring for 6 h. The catalyst was collected by filtration, thoroughly washed with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol severaltimes, respectively. And the black solid was dried in vacuum at 80 °C for 8 h to obtain PdNiCo/N-CNTs (PdNiCo/CNTs). The loading of each metal in the catalysts is listed in Table 1 , which were obtained by ICP-MS (Agilent 7700 ICP-MS)."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Characterization for the catalysts: XRD patterns were collected on an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Ultima IV) using Cu Ka radiation (λ = 1.54 Å, 40 kV and 30 mA) with high-speed array detection system. XPS spectra were recorded on PHI Quantum 2000 Scanning ESCA Microprobe with Al Ka radiation (1486.6 eV). TEM and HRTEM tests were carried out on FEI TECNAI F30 transmission electron microscopy. HAADF-STEM and STEM-EDS elemental analysis measurements were also performed on a FEI TECNAI F30 with the accelerating voltage of 300 kV. Raman spectra were obtained using a Renishaw inVia Raman microscope at an excitation laser wavelength of 325 nm. Elementar vario EL cube was used to detect the contents of N species in the catalysts (elemental analysis). The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and pore-size distribution were obtained on an automatic adsorption apparatus (Micromeritics ASAP 2020) at −196 °C. Before the tests, the sample was degassed in a vacuum at 90 °C for 1 h. The prepared catalysts were placed in a quartz tube for CO2-TPD tests (Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920). The catalysts were firstly pretreated under He flow at 150 °C for 2 h and cooled to 50 °C. Then the quartz tube was introduced with CO2/He flow (concentration of CO2 = 2000 ppm) for 2 h. The CO2-TPD measurements were carried out under He flow (50 mL min−1) by raising the temperature from 50 °C to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The desorbed CO2 was analyzed by a ThermoStar GSD 301T2 mass spectrometer."
5,Catalyzing furfural hydrogenation,"2.4 Catalyzing furfural hydrogenation The catalytic performance of as-prepared catalysts for furfural hydrogenation was tested in a batch reactor (Parr 4848 stainless steel autoclave). Ethanol furfural solution (10 mL) and catalyst (0.05 g) were placed in the autoclave, purged by H2 for 2 min. Then the pressure in the reactor was increased to 3.0 MPa and maintained at 120 °C for 3 h with stirring speed of 870 rpm. After the reaction was over, the reactor was rapidly cooled to 5 °C. The liquid products were analyzed by gas chromatography (Agilent GC 7820A) equipped with a 30 m × 0.250 mm DB-35 capillary column and flame ionization detector and gas chromatography ~ mass spectrometry (Agilent GC-MS 7890B 5977)."
6,Results and discussions,
7,Catalysts characterization results,"3.1 Catalysts characterization results The XRD patterns of Pd/CNTs, CoNi/CNTs, PdNi/CNTs, PdCo/CNTs, PdCoNi/CNTs, Pd/N-CNTs, CoNi/N-CNTs, PdNi/N-CNTs, PdCo/N-CNTs and PdCoNi/N-CNTs are given in Fig. 1 . The diffraction peaks of CNTs(002) (2θ = 26.1°), CNTs(100) (2θ = 43.1°), CNTs(004) (2θ = 53.5°) and CNTs(220) (2θ = 78.2°) planes can be found [32,33]. In the XRD patterns of the Pd-based monometallic catalysts, the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 40.1°, 46.7°, 68.2° and 82.2° are corresponding to Pd(111), Pd(200), Pd(220) and Pd(311) planes, respectively (JCPDS card No. 65–2867). For the monometallic catalysts (Ni/CNTs and Ni/N-CNTs), there are two weak diffraction peaks at 2θ = 44.3° and 51.7°, attributed to Ni(111) and Ni(200) facets, respectively (JCPDS card No. 04–0850). In the Co/CNTs and Co/N-CNTs catalyst, the diffraction peaks of Co(111) (2θ = 44.2°) can be observed. And the weak diffraction peak at 2θ = 33.1° is assigned to Co(OH)2(100) (or Ni(OH)2(100)) planes only for the PdCoNi/CNTs sample (JCPDS card No. 04–0117). In the XRD patterns of the Pd-containing bimetallic and trimetallic catalysts, since Ni (Co) atoms were partially replaced with Pd atoms, the corresponding crystal lattice of Pd would shrink, and the diffraction peak at 2θ = 40.2° shifted toward a high angle relative to Pd(111)-40.1° in the XRD patterns of the Pd/CNTs catalyst. It indicates that PdNi (PdCo or PdNiCo) alloy forms in the PdNi (PdCo or PdNiCo) multimetallic catalysts. Therefore, the XRD characterization results confirm that PdM (M = Ni, Co and NiCo) alloy is present in the Pd-related bimetallic or trimetallic catalysts. The nanostructures of the PdNiCo trimetallic catalysts were further proved by the TEM and HRTEM techniques. The TEM images are shown in Fig. 2 a-c. It can be observed that the metallic nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the carbon nanotubes without obvious agglomeration. In Fig. 2d-f, the crystal lattice spacing with the distance of 0.221 nm and 0.206 nm is observed in the PdNiCo/CNTs and PdCoNi/N-CNTs catalyst, respectively. The above distance of lattice spacing is < 0.224 nm-Pd(111) and > 0.203 nm-Ni(111) (0.205 nm-Co(111)), proving that PdCoNi alloy formed in these two catalysts, in keep with the XRD results. In the PdCoNi/CNTs catalyst, electrons maybe transfer from NiCo to Pd; while in the PdCoNi/N-CNTs catalyst, in addition to some electrons transferring from CoNi to Pd, some electrons transfer from N-CNT to Pd. The pore size distribution and BET isotherms of the catalysts (N-CNTs, PdNiCo/CNTs and PdNiCo/N-CNTs) are displayed in Fig. 3 . Because CNTs have a large pore size, all samples exhibit a type IV curve with H3 hysteresis loop. As shown in Fig. 3b, it can be seen that the size of most pores in the as-prepared samples is below 10 nm. Further observations show that the specific surface area of the PdNiCo/N-CNTs catalyst (133.3 m2 g−1) is much higher than that of PdNiCo/CNTs (73.1 m2 g−1), this phenomenon is consistent with the reference [34]. The thermal-treatment process of N-CNTs might cause the removal of –OH, –COOH and other groups or some organic compounds, resulting in the increase of specific surface area. Additionally, the change in the surface structure probably makes the specific surface area of N-CNTs larger than that of CNTs. Therefore, it can be concluded that PdNiCo/N-CNTs has higher surface area, its catalytic performance would be much better than PdNiCo/CNTs (as listed in Table 2 ). The HAADF-STEM image (Fig. 4 a) and STEM-EDS elemental mapping results of the selected region in Fig. 4a are shown in Fig. 4b-d. In Fig. 4a, it is clearly visible that there is no obvious difference in the brightness of the middle and edge regions of the particles, indicating that the PdNiCo/N-CNTs catalyst is not core–shell structure. As shown in Fig. 4b-d, it clearly demonstrates that Pd, Co and Ni co-exist in PdCoNi/N-CNTs. Additionally, Pd is rich in the center of this PdNiCo alloy nanoparticle. Combining with above other characterization results, it further proves that PdNiCo alloy exists in the PdNiCo/N-CNTs catalyst. The individual particle in Fig. 5 a was analyzed along the direction of the red line, and the STEM-EDS elemental line-scanning profiles are obtained (Fig. 5b). It can be concluded that the intensity of Pd is higher than that of Co (or Ni), and the intensity of Co are almost identical with that of Ni. In addition, it can be clearly observed that the Pd-rich, Co-rich and Ni-rich positions are very similar, and the regulation of Pd, Co and Ni elements distribution lines are coincident. Therefore, it is quite reasonable to infer that PdNiCo alloy nanoparticles exist in the PdNiCo trimetallic catalysts, in a good agreement with the above other characterization results. In the Raman spectra of the catalysts (Fig. 6 ), the peaks at approximately 1351 cm−1 (D-band) and 1581 cm−1 (G-band) can be found [35]. The D-band represents the disordered vibration of carbon heteroatoms on the surface of CNTs, while the G-band can represent the characteristic peak of the sp2 structure in CNTs. ID, IG indicate the peak intensity of D-band and G-band, respectively, and ID/IG can demonstrate the degree of disorder on CNTs surface [36,37]. And the surface of carbon nanotubes was modified so that the functional groups were loaded on the surface and the original ordered structure was destroyed to obtain CNTs and N-CNTs. After different metals were supported on N-CNTs, the intensity ratio of ID/IG was changed. It suggests that metals can change the degree of disorder on the surface of CNTs. In Fig. 7 (the Ni 2p XPS spectra of the catalysts), the peaks with the binding energy of 852.7 eV (Ni(0)), 853.9 eV (NiO), 855.4 eV (Ni(OH)2) and 857.1 eV (NiOOH) can be observed in Ni 2p3/2, Ni(0)-870 eV, NiO-871.2 eV, Ni(OH)2–872.9 eV, NiOOH-874.4 eV in Ni 2p1/2 (Fig. 7a) [38,39]. The binding energy ascribed to Ni(0) specie in the multimetallic catalysts (PdNi/N-CNTs, PdNiCo/CNTs and PdNiCo/N-CNTs) is 852.9 eV, and the binding energy has a shift of 0.2 eV compared with that in CoNi/N-CNTs. As shown in the Co 2p XPS spectra of CoNi/N-CNTs (Fig. 8 ), the binding energies of peaks related to Co(0), CoO and Co(OH)2 are 778.2 eV (793.4 eV), 780.2 eV (795.4 eV) and 781.1 eV (796.8 eV), respectively [40,41]. For the PdCo/N-CNTs, PdNiCo/CNTs and PdNiCo/N-CNTs catalysts, the binding energy assigned to Co(0) has an offset of 0.2 eV as compared to CoNi/N-CNTs. It further explains that PdM alloy (M = Ni, Co or NiCo) generates in the bimetallic and trimetallic catalysts, suggesting Ni or Co donating some electrons to Pd. In Fig. 9 A, the Pd 3d XPS spectra of the PdNiCo/CNTs and PdNiCo/N-CNTs catalyst are displayed. For the PdNiCo/N-CNTs catalyst, the Pd 3d5/2 spectrum can be fitted to two peaks at 335.6 eV and 336.4 eV, respectively, these peaks can be attributed to Pd(0) and Pdn+ [42,43]. The oxidation state palladium is mainly because of Pd(0) atoms on the surface of the PdNiCo nanoparticles being oxidized. The binding energy corresponding to Pd(0) in the PdNiCo/N-CNTs catalyst is significantly lower than that in the PdNiCo/CNTs catalyst as a result of electrons in nitrogen atoms transferring to palladium atoms. Another important evidence is that the binding energy of the N 1 s peak at 399.35 eV in the Pd/N-CNTs, PdNi/N-CNTs, PdCo/N-CNTs and PdNiCo/N-CNTs sample is much higher than that in N-CNTs and NiCo/N-CNTs (398.86 eV). Therefore, the electronic synergy effect is present not only between Pd and Ni (Co) but also between Pd and N. The N 1 s binding energy corresponding to pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, graphitic-N and oxidized-N species located at 398.2 eV, 400 eV, 401 eV and 403.5 eV, respectively [44,45]. The surface basicity properties of different catalysts can be studied by CO2-TPD, as shown in Fig. 10 . For the trimetallic catalysts, when the desorption temperature was increased from 50 °C to 800 °C, the CO2-TPD profile of PdCoNi/N-CNTs showed two desorption peaks. The two peaks (300–400 °C, 500–600 °C) are attributable to moderate and strong basic sites, respectively. At the same time, only moderate basic sites are present in the PdCoNi/CNT catalyst. For the bimetallic catalysts, PdNi/N-CNTs has a weak desorption peak at the temperature of 300–400 °C, indicating that there is a small amount of moderate basic sites in this catalyst. The PdCo/N-CNTs and CoNi/N-CNTs catalysts exhibit two peaks of CO2-desorption in the temperature range of 300–600 °C, corresponding to moderate and strong basic sites, respectively. However, the CO2-desorption peaks area of CoNi/N-CNTs is larger and the corresponding desorption temperature is higher than those of PdCo/N-CNTs, suggesting that the intensity and number of basic active sites on the surface of CoNi/N-CNTs is greater than those of PdCo/N-CNTs. PdNi/N-CNTs has a weak CO2 desorption peak at the temperature of ca. 400 °C, indicating that there is a small amount of moderate basic sites in this catalyst. Compared with PdCo/N-CNTs and CoNi/N-CNTs bimetallic catalysts, because Co species are absent in the PdNi/CNTs catalyst, there is no CO2 desorption peak at 500–600 °C. In addition, the Pd/N-CNTs catalyst has a small CO2-desorption peak (300–400 °C). More importantly, the temperature of CO2-desorption is lowest on the surface of PdNiCo/N-CNTs but its amount of basic active sites is largest, suggesting that it has weakest basic sites but with largest quantity. Based on the above analysis results, the interaction between PdNiCo alloy nanoparticles and N-CNTs decreases the intensity of the surface basicity of PdNiCo/N-CNTs but increases its amount, which is beneficial to enhance its catalytic activity and selectivity to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol for furfural selective hydrogenation. A large number of weaker basic sites in PdNiCo/N-CNTs may be favorable for the formation of furfuryl-oxy intermediate, which plays an important role in the production of furfuryl alcohol and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol by furfural hydrogenation [46]. Therefore, the PdNiCo/N-CNTs catalyst showed excellent catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation of furfural to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (conversion of furfural-100%, selectivity to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol-97.1%, as listed in Table 2)."
8,Catalytic performance of the catalysts,"3.2 Catalytic performance of the catalysts Table 2 discloses the catalytic performance of monometallic, bimetallic and trimetallic catalysts with CNT and N-CNT as supports for furfural hydrogenation under predetermined reaction conditions (reaction time-3 h, 10 mL ethanol furfural solution (concentration-40 mL furfural in 960 mL ethanol), reaction temperature-120 °C, reaction pressure-3.0 MPa). The catalyst support (CNTs) had no catalytic activity for this reaction (entry 1 in Table 2). All the catalysts with CNTs as support (e.g., Pd/CNTs, NiCo/CNTs, PdNi/CNTs, PdCo/CNTs, PdNiCo/CNTs) showed relatively low catalytic performance and selectivity (selectivity to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol <80%, selectivity to furfuryl alcohol <80%) (Table 2 entries 2–6). However, the catalytic performance of the catalysts was significantly improved after doping Co (Ni) in Pd/CNTs (furfural conversion from 74.8% to 100%, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol selectivity from 13.2% to 73.2%), it was due to the addition of the second metal leading to form alloy thus synergistic effect. When N-CNTs was used as the catalyst support, the trimetallic catalysts gave much more outstanding catalytic performance relative to monometallic and bimetallic catalysts owing to the synergy effect of Pd, Ni and Co (entries 7–11, Table 2). All the monometallic and bimetallic catalysts with N-CNTs as support (e.g., Pd/N-CNTs, CoNi/N-CNTs, PdNi/N-CNTs and PdCo/N-CNTs) showed low selectivity to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (<65%). The PdCoNi/N-CNTs catalyst exhibited excellent furfural conversion (100%) and high selectivity to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (97.1%) relative to other as-obtained catalysts. We can infer the following reasons for the PdCoNi/N-CNTs catalyst having excellent catalytic property: (1) The PdNiCo alloy nanostructure in PdCoNi/N-CNTs is conducive to exhibit excellent catalytic activity in furfural hydrogenation. Compared with PdCoNi/CNTs, PdCoNi/N-CNTs has a higher specific surface area; (2) For PdCoNi/N-CNTs, there is strong interaction (synergistic effect of electron) between Pd and pyridine-N, and electrons transfer from pyridine-N to Pd; (3) The electronic synergy effect of Pd, Ni and Co and much more weaker basic active sites in PdNiCo/N-CNTs. The proposed mechanism of electronic synergetic effect is as follows: Because the electronic synergy is present between PdNiCo alloy particles and N-CNTs, electron transfers from N-CNTs (Co、Ni) to Pd, furfural is activated by the electrophilic adsorption between the electrons from carbonyl group and the positively charged holes at the N-CNTs (Co, Ni). Hydrogen is firstly adsorbed at the Pd active sites and activated, forming activated hydrogen species (H*). Finally, the activated furfural reacted with the activated hydrogen species (H*), producing tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol."
9,Stability of the PdCoNi/N-CNTs catalyst for furfural hydrogenation,"3.3 Stability of the PdCoNi/N-CNTs catalyst for furfural hydrogenation The stability of the PdCoNi/N-CNTs catalyst is given in Fig. 11 . After the catalyst was reused five times, the conversion of furfural and the selectivity to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol only slightly decreased. It might be caused by a small loss of catalyst when it was recovered after each reaction. Therefore, the PdNiCo/N-CNTs catalyst is relatively stable in furfural hydrogenation reaction."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, the PdNiCo/N-CNTs catalyst was prepared at room temperature via sodium borohydride reduction method. Other metallic catalysts were obtained by the same preparation method. The XRD, XPS, TEM, HRTEM, STEM-EDS elemental mapping and line-scanning characterization results confirmed the formation of PdNiCo alloy in the PdNiCo/CNTs and PdNiCo/N-CNTs catalyst. Among as-prepared catalysts, the PdNiCo/N-CNTs catalyst showed most excellent catalytic performance and highest selectivity to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol for furfural selective hydrogenation (conversion of furfural-100%, selectivity to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol-97.1%). For the PdNiCo/N-CNTs catalyst, PdNiCo alloy nanostructure; higher specific surface area; the electronic synergy effect between Pd and Ni (Co); there was also a synergistic effect of electron between PdNiCo alloy nanoparticles and nitrogen-doping carbon nanotubes; in addition, the PdNiCo/N-CNTs catalyst had much more weak basic sites. The above-mentioned properties were conducive to the hydrogenation of furfural to produce tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol."
