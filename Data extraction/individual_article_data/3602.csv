0,Introduction,"As a promising high-energy product, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can act as both oxidatnt and reductant in organic synthesis, environmental remediation, disinfection and fuel cells, producing H2O as the sole byproduct [1]. Nowadays, many methods including the anthraquinone method [2a], the direct synthesis from H2 and O2 [2b], the alcohols oxidation method [2c] and electrochemical synthesis [2d] have been adopted to produce H2O2. However, the above methods have two shortcomings: 1) large amounts of energy and organic solvents have been consumed; 2) organic impurities may contaminate the formed H2O2 and increase the difficulty of extraction. Therefore, an efficient, energy-saving and green method to produce H2O2 is highly desired. (1) O2 +2H+ +2e− →H2O2 (0.68V vs. NHE) (2) O2 +e− → O2 − (−0.13V vs. NHE) (3) O2 − +2H+ +e− →H2O2 (1.44V vs. NHE) The photocatalytic H2O2 production through proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) can meet the above requirement because it needs only water (H2O), dioxygen (O2) and light [3]. Among the semiconductor catalysts utilized in the photocatalytic H2O2 production, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)-based catalysts exhibit two advantages compared with the metal oxide-based catalysts: 1) g-C3N4-based catalysts can promote the photocatalytic H2O2 production under visible light; 2) g-C3N4-based catalysts can stabilize the formed H2O2 under light irradition [4]. Generally, the photocatalytic H2O2 production over g-C3N4-based catalysts can process either a direct two-electron O2 reduction (Eq. (1)) [5] or a sequential two-step single-electron O2 reduction (Eqs. (2) and (3)) [6]. The positive shift of the conduction band (CB) level in g-C3N4-based catalysts can enhance the direct two-electron O2 reduction to H2O2 [5]. However, the strategy of promoting the sequential two-step single-electron O2 reduction to H2O2 over g-C3N4-based catalysts remains unknown. Developing the strategy of promoting the sequential two-step single-electron O2 reduction to H2O2 over g-C3N4-based catalysts is therefore demanded. During photocatalysis process, the electron transfer materials such as the metal complex and carbonaceous nanomaterials immobilized onto g-C3N4 can accept the photoinduced electrons from the CB level of g-C3N4 and increase the activity of reduction reaction [7]. As one type of carbonaceous nanomaterials, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with π-conjugative structure are capable of accepting, transporting and storing electrons [8]. Therefore, introducing the CNTs in g-C3N4 to form the hybrid catalyst of g-C3N4-CNTs can enhance the photoinduced electrons generation and further increase the activity of reduction reaction. Although the CNTs has been successfully combined with g-C3N4 based on the electrostatic interaction [9], the effective electronic connection between CNTs and g-C3N4 is far from trivial and cannot transfer the electron effectively [10]. Therefore, the development of covalent combining CNTs with g-C3N4 to enhance the interaction between them is highly desirable. Herein, the graphene-like g-C3N4 nanosheets have been prepared by a facile dicyandiamide-blowing method with NH4Cl as the gas template [11], which have larger amounts of primary amine (NH2) groups than the g-C3N4 prepared by the thermally decomposition of dicyandiamide (Fig. S1). The CNTs have been covalent combined with g-C3N4 through the amidation reaction [12]. The hybrid catalyst of g-C3N4-CNTs with well-defined and stable structure exhibits efficient catalytic performance (32.6μmolh−1) for photocatalytic H2O2 production in the presence of formic acid under visible light. The catalytic and characterization results reveal that the covalent combination of CNTs and g-C3N4 can enhance the single-electron reduction of O2 to O2 − and further promote the sequential two-step single-electron O2 reduction reaction to H2O2."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Dicyandiamide, ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), nitric acid (HNO3, 65wt.%), thionyl chloride (SOCl2), formic acid, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), acetonitrile and nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) were purchased from Alfa Asear company and used as received without further purification. CNTs (MWCNTs, purity >95%) were purchased from Chengdu Organic Chemicals Co. Ltd, Chinese Academy of Sciences. 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline (DMPO) and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich company."
3,Preparation of g-C3N4 [11],"2.2 Preparation of g-C3N4 [11] 2.00g of dicyandiamide and 10.00g of NH4Cl were fully mixed. The mixture was placed in a crucible and heated at 550°C for 4h at a rate of 3°Cmin−1. Then, the crucible was cooled to room temperature naturally. The resulting yellow product was collected and ground into fine powder for further use. Based on the TGA and EA analysis, the formula of g-C3N4 was determined to be C2.53N4H2.03O0.51. For comparison, the g-C3N4-DCA was been prepared by thermally decomposing dicyandiamide at 550°C in a crucible with a cover for 4h in static air with a ramp rate of 3°Cmin−1."
4,Preparation of CNTs-COOH [13],"2.3 Preparation of CNTs-COOH [13] 0.30g of CNTs was loaded on the porous SiO2 griddle of a 30ml silica crucible and then placed into a 50ml Teflon-vessel, at the bottom of which 5ml HNO3 was added previously. Subsequently, the Teflon vessel was sealed in the autoclave and then moved to the oven for steaming at the temperature of 180°C within 4h. After the steaming treatment, cooled down the autoclave to the room temperature and took the silica crucible out of the Teflon vessel into a clean beaker, in which washed the CNTs-COOH with distilled water and ethanol by in-situ filtration. Finally, the silica crucible was transferred to the oven for drying at 60°C and the formed solid black cakes could be collected."
5,Preparation of CNTs-COCl [14],"2.4 Preparation of CNTs-COCl [14] 0.05g of CNTs-COOH was stirred in a mixture of 10ml SOCl2 and 1ml DMF at approximately 80°C for 24h. Then, the mixture was isolated by vacuum filtration through a PTFE membrane (pore size: 0.2mm), washed with acetonitrile. Usually, the CNTs-COCl was used almost immediately after isolation in the next reaction step in order to avoid the hydrolysis of the formed chloroanhydride."
6,Preparation of g-C3N4-CNTs,"2.5 Preparation of g-C3N4-CNTs g-C3N4 (1.00g) was dispersed in 30ml acetonitrile, and CNTs-COCl (0.05g) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at 80°C for 24h. The hybrid catalyst of g-C3N4-CNTs was centrifugated, washed by water, and then dried at 60°C in air. Based on the TGA and EA analysis, the formula of g-C3N4-CNTs was determined to be C2.77N4H1.97O0.61 (4.58wt.% CNTs). For comparison, g-C3N4-CNTs-IMP based on the electrostatic interaction has been prepared through the impregnation method with the same CNTs weight percentage as g-C3N4-CNTs based on covalent interaction."
7,Photocatalytic evaluation,"2.6 Photocatalytic evaluation The photocatalytic activities were evaluated by the activation of oxygen under light irradiation (λ ≥ 400nm). A 300W Xenon lamp (Perfect Light Company, Beijing) was chosen as light source. During each photocatalytic performance, 0.10g of catalyst was dispersed into 100ml of formic acid/water mixture (5/95v/v) in a container (1gL−1 catalyst). After that, the dispersion was stirred in the dark for 60min to ensure the adsorption-desorption equilibrium among the catalyst, dissolved oxygen and water before light irradiation. During the irradiation, 1.5ml of the suspensions was taken from the reaction cell at given time intervals, and then filtrated to remove the catalysts. The concentrations of H2O2 generated were determined by iodometric titration [3b]. After completion of the reaction, the catalysts can be recovered by centrifugation, washed with water, and dried at 60°C in air. To investigate the decomposition behavior of H2O2 over the photocatalysts, a sample of 1gL−1 was dispersed in H2O2 solution (initial concentration: 1mM) and irradiated for 60min under continuous stirring."
8,Rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements,"2.7 Rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements The measurements were performed on a Pine AFMSRXE 1523 advanced electrochemical system with a three-electrode cell using an Ag/AgCl electrode and a Pt wire electrode as the reference and counter electrode, respectively [15a]. The working electrode was prepared as follows: catalysts (50mg) were dispersed in EtOH (2ml) containing Nafion (50mg) by ultrasonication. The slurry (20μl) was put onto a Pt disk electrode and dried at room temperature. The LSV were obtained in an O2-saturated 0.1M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) with a scan rate 10mVs−1 after O2 bubbling for 5min. The average number of electrons (n) involved in the overall O2 reduction can be estimated by the linear regression of the plots using the following equations: (4) j −1 = j k −1 +B−1 ω −1/2 (5) B=0.2nFν −1/6 CD 2/3 j is the current density, j k is the kinetic current density, ω is the rotating speed (rpm), F is the Faraday constant (96,485Cmol−1), ν is the kinetic viscosity of water (0.01cm2 s −1), C is the bulk concentration of O2 in water (1.26×10−3 molcm−3), and D is the diffusion coefficient of O2 (2.7×10−5 cm2 s−1), respectively [15b]."
9,O2 − radical examination,"2.8 O2 − radical examination O2 − was examined by a Bruker model electron spin resonance (ESR) A300-10/12 spectrometer equipped with a quanta-Ray Nd: YAG laser system employing 5,5-dimethyl-l-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as the spin trapper. Typically, catalyst (0.10g) was added to a methanol/water mixture (9/1v/v, 100ml) containing DMPO (0.125mmol) within a container. After O2 bubbling for 10min, the container was photo irradiated for 3min. The catalyst was recovered by filtration, and the solution was subjected to analysis at room temperature."
10,O2 − radical examination [16],"2.9 O2 − radical examination [16] In order to quantify the O2 − concentration, nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) has been chosen as a O2 − radical scavenger because NBT can be reduced by O2 − radicals and formed purple formazan, which was insoluble in water. The photocatalytic activities were evaluated by the activation of oxygen under light irradiation (λ≥400nm). A 300W Xenon lamp (Perfect Light Company, Beijing) was chosen as light source. During each photocatalytic performance, 0.10g of catalyst was added to a formic acid/water mixture (5/95v/v, 100ml) containing NBT (0.02mM) within a container (1gL−1 catalyst). After that, the dispersion was stirred in the dark for 60min to ensure the adsorption-desorption equilibrium among the catalyst, dissolved oxygen and water before light irradiation. During the irradiation, 3.0ml of the suspensions was taken from the reaction cell at given time intervals, and then filtrated to remove the catalysts. The concentration of O2 − radicals was determined by the degradation of NBT, measured by the absorbance change at the wavelength of 259nm. The mole ratio of generated O2 − radicals and degraded NBT was 4: 1 according to the following equation: (6)"
11,Photogenerated electrons demonstration [17],"2.10 Photogenerated electrons demonstration [17] 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) was examined by a Bruker model electron spin resonance (ESR) A300-10/12 spectrometer equipped with a quanta-Ray Nd: YAG laser system. The reduction of TEMPO by electrons produces an ESR silent molecule, TEMPOH, and leads to the reduction of intensity and flatting of ESR spectra. Therefore, the consumption of TEMPO demonstrates that reactive electrons are generated during photo-excitation. Typically, catalyst (0.10g) was added to a formic acid/water mixture (5/95v/v, 100ml) containing TEMPO (0.02mM) within a container. After stirring for 10min, the mixture was photo irradiated for 3min. The catalyst was recovered by filtration, and the solution was subjected to analysis at room temperature."
12,Results and discussion,
13,Covalent combination of CNTs and g-C3N4,"3.1 Covalent combination of CNTs and g-C3N4 The graphene-like g-C3N4 nanosheets have been prepared by a facile dicyandiamide-blowing method with NH4Cl as the gas template [11], which have larger amounts of primary amine (NH2) groups than the g-C3N4 prepared by the thermally decomposition of dicyandiamide (Fig. S1). As shown in Fig. 1 , the oxidation of CNTs to CNTs-COOH have been achieved through the acid vapor method [13]. Then, the CNTs-COOH have been transformed to CNTs-COCl by refluxing with an excess of thionyl chloride (SOCl2) in the presence of a small amount of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) [14]. Finally, the acyl chloride (COCl) groups of CNTs-COCl can react with the NH2 groups of g-C3N4 to form the amide (CONH) groups [12]. In this way, the CNTs have been covalent combined with g-C3N4 to form the hybrid catalyst of g-C3N4-CNTs for photocatalytic H2O2 production."
14,Characterization of g-C3N4-CNTs,"3.2 Characterization of g-C3N4-CNTs Fig. 2 shows the C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s XPS spectra of g-C3N4, CNTs, and g-C3N4-CNTs. As shown in Fig. 2A, XPS peaks of C 1s for g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-CNTs can be fitted with three peaks at binding energies of around 283.3, 284.4 and 287.5eV, which are ascribed to the tertiary carbon CN3 groups, the CNH2 groups and the CC groups, respectively [18]. The area ratios of the CC groups peaks to the tertiary carbon CN3 peaks are 0.39 and 0.51 for g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-CNTs; while the area ratios of the CNH2 groups peaks to the tertiary carbon CN3 peaks are 0.30 and 0.24 for g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-CNTs. The increase of the CC groups and the decrease of the CNH2 groups support the CNTs have been covalent combined with g-C3N4. Nevertheless, the XPS peaks of N 1s (Fig. 2B) for g-C3N4 can be fitted with three peaks at 398.1, 399.8, and 403.7eV, which are assigned to the N-(C2), N-(C3), and NH2, respectively [5,6][5c,6b]. However, the g-C3N4-CNTs only exhibits two peaks at 397.8 and 399.4eV corresponding to N-(C2) and N-(C3). The disappearance of NH2 peak indicates that the NH2 groups of g-C3N4 react with the acyl chloride (COCl) groups of CNTs-COCl to form the amide groups (CONH) during the covalent combination of CNTs with g-C3N4. XPS peaks of O 1s (Fig. 2C) for CNTs and g-C3N4-CNTs can be fitted with two peaks at binding energies of around 530.5 and 532.0eV, which are ascribed to the CO groups and the CO groups, respectively [19]. The area ratios of these two peaks are 1.72 and 2.39 for CNTs and g-C3N4-CNTs. The increase of the CO groups support the presence of the CONH groups in g-C3N4-CNTs. The above XPS results confirm the CNTs have been covalent combined with g-C3N4 through the amidation reaction. The XRD patterns of g-C3N4, CNTs and g-C3N4-CNTs are shown in Fig. S2. The g-C3N4 has two distinct diffraction peaks at 13.1° and 27.6°, which correspond to the graphitic materials as the (100) and (002) diffraction planes in JCPDS 87-1526 [20]. The diffraction peak at 26.4° in CNTs can be attributed to the graphite-like structure (002) of the CNTs [9a,b]. For g-C3N4-CNTs, only the diffraction peaks at 13.1° and 27.6° assigned to the (100) and (002) diffraction planes of g-C3N4 have been observed, indicating that the covalent combined CNTs have been highly dispersed on g-C3N4 [9c,d]. Fig. S3 shows the IR spectra of g-C3N4, CNTs and g-C3N4-CNTs. No distinct changes can be observed for g-C3N4-CNTs in comparison to g-C3N4, which is consistent with the reported results [9c,d]. The sharp peak at 810cm−1 is originated from the breathing mode of the tri-s-triazine units of g-C3N4. The peaks in the region from 900 to 1800cm−1 are attributed to typical bands of aromatic CN heterocycles containing either trigonal N(-C)3 (full condensation) or bridging CNHC units (partial condensation), evidencing the formation of extended network of CNC bonds [9c,d]. In addition, the broad peaks at around 3100–3400cm−1 are mainly due to the NH2 groups of the adsorbed H2O from air, which become weaker after covalent combination [21], indicating the decreased content of surface NH2 groups in g-C3N4-CNTs. CO2 temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) has been performed to investigate the content of NH2 groups in g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-CNTs as the NH2 groups can act as Lewis base sites and adsorb slightly acidic CO2 molecules [22]. Fig. S4 shows the peak area of g-C3N4-CNTs is smaller than that of g-C3N4. Furthermore, the zeta potentials of aqueous suspension of g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-CNTs have been measured because the NH2 groups with the free lone pair electrons on nitrogen atoms can act as proton acceptors and acquire positive surface charges [23]. Fig. S5 shows the zeta potential of g-C3N4-CNTs (−18.6mV) is more negative than that of g-C3N4 (−15.2mV). The above IR, CO2-TPD and zeta potential results reveal the significant decrease of NH2 groups in g-C3N4 after covalent combination, confirming the reaction between the NH2 groups of g-C3N4 and the carboxyl groups of CNTs. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribution patterns for g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-CNTs are shown in Fig. S6. The isotherms for g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-CNTs (Fig. S6A) show type IV isotherm with a type H3 hysteresis loop. These two catalysts present two peaks centered at 3.8nm and 41.9nm in a broad pore-size distribution curve (1–132nm) in Fig. S6B, which are probably attributed to the inner cavity diameter of the CNTs and the pores formed in the assembled 3D matrix, respectively [9c]. The surface area, pore volume and pore diameter of g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-CNTs are shown in Table S1. Compared with g-C3N4, the decrease in these values of g-C3N4-CNTs is due to the mesopores of the covalent combined CNTs have been blocked by g-C3N4 [9d]. Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) curves for g-C3N4, CNTs and g-C3N4-CNTs are shown in Fig. S7. The total weight loss of g-C3N4 is 99.85% between 30 and 800°C due to the direct thermal decomposition of g-C3N4. For CNTs, the weight loss in the range of 30–800°C range (27.23%) corresponds to the oxidative degradation of the CNTs [12]. Combining the TGA and EA analysis (Table S2), the molecular formulas of g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-CNTs can be given as C2.53N4H2.03O0.51 and C2.77N4H1.97O0.61 (4.58wt.% CNTs). Fig. S8 is the TEM images of the g-C3N4, which exhibit sheet-like structure. The TEM images of the g-C3N4-CNTs are shown in Fig. 3 . It is clear that the tube-like CNTs are highly dispersed on g-C3N4 [9a,d]. The HR-TEM image of g-C3N4-CNTs (Fig. 3D) is quite different from that of g-C3N4 (Fig. S8D), which shows that the CNTs and the g-C3N4 have been effectively combined together after covalent combination [9b,c]. The above characterization results confirm that the CNTs has been covalent combined with g-C3N4 to form the hybrid catalyst of g-C3N4-CNTs. Furthermore, the catalytic performanc of g-C3N4-CNTs should be investigated."
15,Catalytic performance of g-C3N4-CNTs,"3.3 Catalytic performance of g-C3N4-CNTs The photocatalytic H2O2 production over various catalysts has been conducted and monitored in an O2-equilibrated conditions and light irradiation (λ≥400nm) in the presence of 5vol.% formic acid at 25°C. To investigate the role of formic acid in the photocatalytic H2O2 production, the photocatalytic H2O2 production over g-C3N4-CNTs in the presence of 5 vol.% methanol or formic acid has been performed (Fig. S9). The catalytic performance of g-C3N4-CNTs with 5 vol.% methanol (23.1μmol in 60min) is lower than that of g-C3N4-CNTs with 5vol.% formic acid (48.7μmol in 60min). The pH values of the methanol/water (5/95) and formic acid/water (5/95) solutions are 7.2 and 1.7 respectively. The decreasing pH of the reaction solution can accelerate the photocatalytic H2O2 production under visible light irradiation [3b]. Therefore, formic acid works as not only a good electron donor but also as a pH-regulating agent. It has been reported that the formic acid can be oxidized to the carbon dioxide (CO2) with almost stoichiometric production of H2O2 with molar ratio of 1:1 under similar reaction conditions [3b]. The equation of the photocatalytic H2O2 production in the presence of formic acid can be presented as Eq. (7): (7) O 2 + H C O O H → H 2 O 2 + C O 2 Δ r G 0 = − 153.4 k J m o l − 1 As shown in Fig. 4 A, the H2O2 can be rapidly generated over g-C3N4-CNTs and the amounts of formed H2O2 can reach 48.7μmol in 60min. The catalytic performance of individual g-C3N4 (15.2μmol in 60min) or CNTs (2.1μmol in 60min) is lower than that of g-C3N4-CNTs. For comparison, g-C3N4-CNTs-IMP based on the electrostatic interaction has been prepared through the impregnation method with the same CNTs weight percentage as g-C3N4-CNTs based on covalent interaction. g-C3N4-CNTs-IMP shows lower catalytic performance (18.1μmol in 60min). The reaction cannot proceed in the absence of catalyst (<0.1μmol in 60min). The photocatalytic H2O2 production over g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-CNTs has been performed under N2- and O2-equilibrated conditions to investigate the role of O2 in the photocatalytic H2O2 production (Fig. S10). Generally, the photoexcited conduction band (CB) electrons can be scavenged by dissolved O2 under O2-equilibrated conditions but the protons should uptake the electrons in the absence of O2 (N2-equilibrated conditions) [3c]. Under N2-equilibrated conditions, no H2O2 can be formed over both g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-CNTs, confirming that the H2O2 is generated through the O2 reduction. The effect of initial CNTs dosage (2.5wt.%, 5wt.% and 7.5wt.%) have been investigated. As shown in Fig. S11, g-C3N4-CNTs-5 exhibits higher catalytic performance than g-C3N4-CNTs-2.5. As the CNTs can act as an electron reservoir to trap electrons immigrated from photoexcited g-C3N4, increasing the loading of CNTs from 2.5wt.% to 5wt.% can hinder the charge recombination and improve the activity of g-C3N4-CNTs toward photocatalytic H2O2 production under visible light. However, the further loading of CNTs from 5wt.% to 7.5wt.% decrease the photocatalytic performance. This is due to the competitive light absorption of CNTs to g-C3N4 while no effective electron-transfer channels could be formed between the unoccupied CNTs and g-C3N4 [9c,d]. Fig. S12 shows the g-C3N4-DCA prepared by the thermally decomposition of dicyandiamide shows lower catalytic performance (2.8μmol in 60min) than g-C3N4 through dicyandiamide-blowing method with NH4Cl as the gas template (15.2μmol in 60min). The reason is that g-C3N4 has larger amounts of NH2 groups that are active for photocatalytic H2O2 production than g-C3N4-DCA [5c,6b]. (8) [ H 2 O 2 ] = K f K d ( 1 − e K d t ) The formation and decomposition of H2O2 over catalysts proceeds through two competitive pathways owing to the thermodynamic instability of H2O2 at room temperature [3a,24]. The K f and K d values have been estimated by fitting the data in Fig. 4A according to Eq. (8) and the results are presented in Fig. 4B [25]. In order to investigate the stability of different catalysts, the reaction time has been extended to 240min. The maximum amounts of formed H2O2 over g-C3N4-CNTs, g-C3N4-CNTs-IMP and g-C3N4 can be obtained as 130.2, 53.8 and 42.1μmol in 240min, respectively (Fig. 4C), which gives the H2O2 formation rate of 32.6, 13.5 and 10.5μmolh−1 for g-C3N4-CNTs, g-C3N4-CNTs-IMP and g-C3N4 (Table S3). The values of K f obtained from the photocatalytic H2O2 production over different catalysts (Fig. 4B) decrease in the following order: g-C3N4-CNTs (1.0806μmolmin−1)>g-C3N4-CNTs-IMP (0.4505μmolmin−1)>g-C3N4 (0.4382μmolmin−1)>CNTs (0.0438μmolmin−1)>None (0.0042μmolmin−1), which is consistent with the above H2O2 formation rate of different catalysts (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, the values of K d obtained from the photocatalytic H2O2 decomposition over different catalysts (Fig. S13) increases in the following order: None (0.0072min−1)<CNTs (0.0091min−1)<g-C3N4-CNTs (0.0149min−1)<g-C3N4 (0.0203min−1)<g-C3N4-CNTs-IMP (0.0234min−1). The above results confirm that the covalent combination of CNTs and g-C3N4 can stabilize the formed H2O2 under light irradiation. Above all, the covalent combination of CNTs and g-C3N4 can enhance the photocatalytic H2O2 production. Under similar reaction conditions over the g-C3N4-based catalysts with electron donors, the H2O2 formation rate (32.6μmolh−1) over g-C3N4-CNTs is more than those over g-C3N4 (2.5μmolh−1) [4a], meso g-C3N4 (3.8μmolh−1) [4b], g-C3N4-KPO (10.0μmolh−1) [3c], 3DOM g-C3N4-PW11 (10.4μmolh−1) [5c] and g-C3N4-BDI50 (22.2μmolh−1) [26]. In addition, the catalytic performance of g-C3N4-CNTs (32.6μmolh−1) is higher than those of carbonate-surface modified bimodal size distribution-Au/TiO2 (BM-Au/TiO2-CO3 2−, 10.0μmolh−1) [3b] and Au0.2/BiVO4 (25.0μmolh−1) [27]. Furthermore, the formed H2O2 can reach 1.3μmol in 60min over g-C3N4-CNTs without electron donor (Fig. 4D), suggesting the g-C3N4-CNTs can act as a dual-functional catalyst for both water oxidation (Fig. S14) and oxygen reduction [5c,28]. Therefore, the relative high H2O2 formation rates among the reported g-C3N4-based catalysts and the ability of producing H2O2 without electron donor make g-C3N4-CNTs a promising catalyst for photocatalytic H2O2 production."
16,Structure-catalytic performance relationship of g-C3N4-CNTs,"3.4 Structure-catalytic performance relationship of g-C3N4-CNTs Photoelectrochemical characterization should be performed to clarify the reason for the efficient activity of g-C3N4-CNTs. As shown in Fig. S15A, the photo-current density of g-C3N4-CNTs (0.32μAcm−2) is much larger than that of g-C3N4 (0.03μAcm−2). Photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results are shown in Fig. S15B. The diameter of Nyquist semicircle for g-C3N4-CNTs is smaller than that of g-C3N4, which indicates that the g-C3N4-CNTs composites have lower resistances than g-C3N4. The emission peak appearing at about 433nm in photoluminescence (PL) spectra of g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-CNTs is attributed to the direct electron-hole recombination of band transition. Compare with g-C3N4, g-C3N4-CNTs possess a weaker emission peak (Fig. S16A). The above results reveal that the covalent combination of CNTs and g-C3N4 can enhance the charge separation of g-C3N4-CNTs. Electrochemical rotating disk electrode (RDE) analysis of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) further investigates the pathway of O2 reduction. Fig. S17 shows the LSV curves of g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-CNTs measured on RDE in an O2-saturated 0.1M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) at different rotating speeds. Fig. 5 A summarizes the Koutecky-Levich plots of the data at −0.9V vs. Ag/AgCl [15]. The n value for g-C3N4-CNTs (n=1.96) is higher than that for g-C3N4 (n=1.29), suggesting that the CNTs covalent combined with g-C3N4 can promote the electrons generation. In order to investigate the generation of photoinduced electrons, electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) as a spin-trapping reagent has been performed over g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-CNTs. The reduction of TEMPO by electrons produces an ESR silent molecule, TEMPOH, and leads to the reduction of intensity and flatting of ESR spectra [17]. As shown in Fig. 5B, when irradiated for 3min, both g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-CNTs caused reduction of the TEMPO signal, suggesting the electron transfer from photoexcited g-C3N4 or g-C3N4-CNTs to TEMPO. The consumption of TEMPO demonstrates that reactive electrons are generated during photo-excitation of g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-CNTs. The reduction of TEMPO signal intensity caused by g-C3N4-CNTs is greater than that by g-C3N4, indicating that higher reducing ability of photoexcited g-C3N4-CNTs than g-C3N4. The above results reveal that the CNTs covalent combined with g-C3N4 can promote the photoinduced electrons generation. Electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin-trapping reagent has been performed to confirm the pathway of O2 reduction over different catalysts. Fig. 6 A shows the ESR spectra of the solutions recovered after photoreaction over g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-CNTs for 3min. Both solutions exhibit distinctive signals assigned to the DMPO-O2 − spin adduct [4b]. The signal intensity for the solution obtained by photoreaction over g-C3N4-CNTs is stronger than that over g-C3N4. In order to quantify the O2 − concentration, nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) has been chosen as a O2 − radical scavenger because NBT can be reduced by O2 − radicals and formed purple formazan, which was insoluble in water [16]. Figs. S18 and 6 B show the evolution of NBT disappearance and the subsequent formation of O2 − radicals during the photocatalytic H2O2 production over g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-CNTs. The ESR signal and quantitative experiment of O2 − results reveal that the CNTs covalent combined with g-C3N4 can enhance the single-electron reduction of O2 to O2 −, suggesting the photocatalytic H2O2 production over g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-CNTs both process through sequential two-step single-electron O2 reduction reaction (Eqs. (2) and (3)) [6]. The scavenger experiments using p-benzoquinone (PBQ) have been performed to investigate the role of O2 −. As can be seen from Fig. 6C, the addition of PBQ can actually depress the photocatalytic H2O2 production over g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-CNTs. The PBQ scavenger experiments results confirm that the photocatalytic H2O2 production over g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-CNTs both process through the sequential two-step single-electron O2 reduction reaction and the CNTs covalent combined with g-C3N4 can enhance the single-electron reduction of O2 to O2 −. The Mott-Schottky plots of g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-CNTs at varied frequencies (1.0, 1.5 and 2.0kHz) exhibit positive slopes (Figs. S19A and B), suggestive of their n-type semiconductor features [29]. A flat band potential of −0.04V and −0.38V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) has been obtained for g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-CNTs, respectively [30]. Considering the conduction band (CB) could be 0–0.1V more negative than the flat band position, the corresponding CB edge of g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-CNTs has been estimated to be −0.14V and −0.48V vs. NHE, respectively. From the Tauc plots of g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-CNTs (Fig. S16C), the band gap of g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-CNTs are 3.06 and 2.88eV, respectively [31]. Combining the Mott-Schottky measurements and Tauc plots results, the valence band (VB) positions of g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-CNTs have been estimated as 2.92V and 2.40V vs. NHE, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6D, a negative shift of 0.34V for the CB level from g-C3N4 to g-C3N4-CNTs has been observed. The negative shift of the CB level in g-C3N4-CNTs can promote the photoinduced generation, which is consistent with the Koutecky-Levich plots results and ESR results for TEMPO [15,17]. Moreover, the CB level in g-C3N4-CNTs (−0.48V vs. NHE) has sufficient potential difference (0.35V) from the single-electron reduction of O2 to O2 − (−0.13V vs. NHE), confirming the PBQ scavenger experiments, the ESR signal and quantitative experiment of O2 − results [6]. Above all, the negative shifts of the CB level from g-C3N4 to g-C3N4-CNTs can enhance the single-electron reduction of O2 to O2 − and further promote the sequential two-step single-electron O2 reduction reaction to H2O2."
17,Recycle of heterogeneous g-C3N4-CNTs,"3.5 Recycle of heterogeneous g-C3N4-CNTs It is essential to confirm the catalysis of g-C3N4-CNTs is truly heterogeneous for photocatalytic H2O2 production. When the reaction time arrives at 30min, g-C3N4-CNTs has been removed from the reaction system by filtration, and the reaction is allowed to proceed with the filtrate under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 7 A, no new H2O2 forms and the formed H2O2 starts to decompose under the same conditions. The above results confirm that the g-C3N4-CNTs is truly heterogeneous for photocatalytic H2O2 production. To investigate the stability of heterogeneous g-C3N4-CNTs, the photocatalytic H2O2 production has been recycled for three times under the same conditions. Fig. 7B shows the catalytic performance is almost unchanged and the catalyst recovery can reach above 98% even after three times. The XRD and IR results of the fresh and used g-C3N4-CNTs exhibit almost the same typical peaks (Fig. S20). The TEM results of the used g-C3N4-CNTs (Fig. S21) indicate that the sheet-like structure and the dispersion of CNTs cluster on g-C3N4-CNTs are retained after reaction. The EA results in Table S2 also reveal that the composition of the used g-C3N4-CNTs remains unchanged. The above results indicate that the heterogeneous g-C3N4-CNTs is catalytic stable."
18,Conclusions,"In summary, to develop the strategy of promoting the sequential two-step single-electron O2 reduction to H2O2 over g-C3N4-based catalysts, the CNTs have been covalent combined with g-C3N4 through the amidation reaction. The hybrid catalyst of g-C3N4-CNTs with well-defined and stable structure exhibits efficient catalytic performance (32.6μmolh−1) for photocatalytic H2O2 production in the presence of formic acid under visible light. Three reasons have been presented for the efficient catalytic performance of g-C3N4-CNTs from the catalytic and characterization results: 1) The value of electron transfer during the ORR process obtained from the Koutecky-Levich plot for g-C3N4-CNTs (n=1.96) is higher than that for g-C3N4 (n=1.29), suggesting that the CNTs covalent combined with g-C3N4 can promote the electrons generation; 2) The reduction of ESR signal intensity for TEMPO caused by g-C3N4-CNTs is greater than that by g-C3N4, indicating that higher reducing ability of photoexcited g-C3N4-CNTs than g-C3N4; 3) the PBQ scavenger experiments, the ESR signal and quantitative experiment of O2 − results reveal that the negative shifts of the CB level from g-C3N4 to g-C3N4-CNTs can enhance the single-electron reduction of O2 to O2 − and further promote the sequential two-step single-electron O2 reduction reaction to H2O2."
