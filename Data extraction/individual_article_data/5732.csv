0,Introduction,"Worldwide there is a major concern for the security of energy and climate change. In recent years H2 production via steam reforming of renewable liquid fuels, such as bio-oil made from biomass resources, has attracted more attention. Renewable energy sources such as biomass are expected to be neutral source and will be the important source for the production of H2 in long term. Vehicles using H2 could have very low or zero well-to-wheel CO2 emissions [1–7]. Biomass energy crops such as straw, forestry wastes, sewage sludge, landfill gases, municipal solid wastes (MSW) and algae biomass can be used for producing H2 or H2-rich gases. Producing H2 in the large quantities necessary for the transport and stationary power markets could either become a barrier to choose the right pathway or a challenge for the researchers. However, high dispersion distribution and low energy density of biomass lead to a high transportation cost for its wide utilization [7,8]. As a result, H2 production via gasification and pyrolysis of biomass on a large scale will be economically limited. Main components of bio-oil belong to the following groups: acids, aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, phenols, sugars, and furans [9–11]. Phenolic compounds are derived from lignin, whereas the rest components are mainly obtained from cellulose and hemicelluloses [12,13]. Due to extremely heterogeneous composition of bio-oil, current studies are more focused on the steam reforming (SR) of model compounds of bio-oils such as acetic acid, ethylene glycol, acetone, ethylene acetate, xylene and glucose. Catalytic steam reforming of acetic acid has been extensively performed by other research groups because it is one of the major components of bio-oil (up to 12%) [8,14,15]. Acetic acid itself is renewable and can be easily obtained from biomass by fermentation process [16]. In addition, acetic acid is noninflammable unlike methanol and ethanol; hence it is a safe H2 carrier and chosen as a model compound. Bimetallic catalysts such as Ni–Co and Ni–Al were prepared by co-precipitation method and were able to produce high H2 yield at lower temperature by catalytic SR of acetic acid [17,18]. Concerning to different activities of Ni–Co and Co/Al2O3 catalysts for the secondary reactions such as acetic acid decomposition, methanation, reverse water gas shift reaction during SR reactions were speculated as the main reasons for different CO and CH4 selectivities. Hence, additional experiments, including the acetic acid decomposition, methanation, and methane steam reforming, were performed over Ni/Al2O3 and Co/Al2O3 catalysts, respectively. Some noble metals not only have the tendency to break CC bonds, but they also promote hydrogenation. Haga et al., have discussed that the selectivity to H2 decreased in the order of Co>Ni>Rh>Pt. Generally it is accepted that the selectivity to methane decreases with increasing acetic acid/H2O (C/S) ratio [19]. Main aim of the present research is to develop an efficient and stable catalyst for the steam reforming of acetic acid considering it as a model compound of bio-oil. Reforming of acetic acid for hydrogen production can be summarized by the following reactions as discussed in Eqs. (1)–(4): (1) CH 3 COOH ⟶ H 2 O 2 CO + 2 H 2 Δ H ° 298 K = 213.4 kJ / mole Followed by water gas shift reaction: (2) CO + H 2 O ⇄ catalyst CO 2 + H 2 Δ H ° 298 K = − 41 kJ/mole The overall steam reforming reaction may be represented as follows, (3) CH 3 COOH + 2 H 2 O ⟶ catalyst 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 Δ H ° 298 K = 131.4 kJ/mole The maximum stoichiometric yield of hydrogen for acetic acid SR is of 2mole per mole of carbon. As steam reforming is carried out at high temperature, there is a strong possibility of decomposition of acetic acid into lower molecular weight oxygenates and lighter hydrocarbons including CH4, C2H4, etc. In general decomposition reaction of acetic acid is as follows [20–28]: (4) C x H y O z + H 2 O → Carbon + Gases ( H 2 , CO , CO 2 , CH 4 , C x H y + 2 )"
1,Experiments,
2,Catalysts preparation,2.1 Catalysts preparation All the chemicals and precursor used for catalyst preparation were of high purity (99.9%) and procured from Merck (Germany).
3,Co-precipitation method for Ni–Co catalyst (NC),"2.2 Co-precipitation method for Ni–Co catalyst (NC) The catalysts precursors used for nickel and cobalt were of Ni(NO3)2 and Co(NO3)2, added to millipore water based on their metal loading of 20:80wt%. Vigorously stirred solution of (1N) Na2CO3 at room temperature was added to the solution of metal salts until precipitate was obtained. The resulted precipitate was filtered and washed with double distilled water until pH reached to 6.5±0.2. The precipitate was dried at 105±2°C for 12h followed by calcination at 500±3°C. The powder was pelletized followed by crushing to desired particle size of 0.6±0.1mm for kinetic experiments."
4,Impregnation method for Ni–Co/CeO2/ZrO2 (NCCZ) catalyst,"2.3 Impregnation method for Ni–Co/CeO2/ZrO2 (NCCZ) catalyst Solution of known amounts for both zirconia and ceria precursors such as ZrO(NO3)2·XH2O and Ce(NO3)3·6H2O respectively was thoroughly mixed in a rotary evaporator at 90°C until all the water was evaporated. The final support was dried at 105±2°C, overnight followed by calcination at 460±3°C for 6h. After that Ni–Co metals were incorporated on the support with double wet impregnation method using Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Co(NO3)2·6H2O, as metal precursors for Ni and Co respectively. The active metal salts were dried in an oven at 105±2°C followed by calcinations at 500±5°C for 5h. After calcinations pellets were prepared and crushed to the desired size for the experiments with a (Ni–Co/CeO2–ZrO2) 15:60:10:15wt% distribution."
5,Impregnation method for alumina supported Ni catalyst with La2O3 promoter (NLA),2.4 Impregnation method for alumina supported Ni catalyst with La2O3 promoter (NLA) The La2O3/Al2O3 support was synthesized by impregnating γ-Al2O3 with La2(NO3)3. A known amount of nitrate precursor solution was added to Al2O3 support. The slurry was heated slowly into a rotary evaporator until all the water was evaporated. The resulting precipitate was dried at 105±2°C overnight followed by calcination in air at 900±3°C for 11h with a ramp rate of 1°C/min. After that the nickel supported catalyst was prepared by the wet impregnation method in similar way as discussed before and the final catalyst composition was 17% Ni/15% La2O3/68% Al2O3 as support.
6,Catalyst characterization,"2.5 Catalyst characterization An energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) technique was used to investigate the surface properties for the point specific composition of the calcined catalyst such as NC, NCCZ and NLA respectively. Final metal loading on the catalyst was determined both by UV–visible spectroscopy and SEM–EDX analysis using new ZEISS Series Scanning Electron Microscope EVO 50. The BET surface area of the catalysts was determined by N2 adsorb–desorption method at −196°C using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 apparatus. During BET analysis the samples were degassed at 190±2°C for 2h to remove adsorbed gases and moisture followed by surface area analysis. TGA was used to analyze weight loss during heat treatment for the precalcined catalysts and to estimate the amount of coke deposited on the used catalyst surface using a SDT Q600 thermal analyzer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Philips powder diffractometer, with Cu Kα radiation. The morphology of the catalyst sample was investigated using scanning electron microscope (SEM), where SEM EVO50 having the resolution 2.0nm at 30kV (SE with LaB6 option) with magnification ranges up to 1,000,000× and at an acceleration voltage ranging from 0.2 to 30kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using PHILIPS CM12 microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 100kV. The average particle size of these three set calcined catalyst (NC, NCCZ and NLA) was estimated from Scherrer's equation applying most intense reflection of different crystallites at different 2θ value."
7,Apparatus and experimental procedure,"2.6 Apparatus and experimental procedure Steam reforming of acetic acid was conducted at atmospheric pressure and temperature range of 550–700°C in continuous flow fixed-bed quartz reactor with 19mm i.d. The acetic acid concentration was varied from 15 to 25% (w/w), maintaining the feed flow rate in the range of 0.5–1.12mL/min [24,28]. HPLC pump (Gilson 350) was used for feeding the liquid reactants at different molar ratio of acetic acid and water into the reactor through a preheater arrangement. All the three zones of quartz reactor were equipped with coaxial thermocouple for temperature monitoring. Catalyst samples were arranged on the catalyst bed which was adjusted to middle portion of the reactor to get uniform temperature distribution. Preliminary runs were carried out in fixed bed reactor to eliminate film diffusion and pore diffusion resistances. The experiments were carried out at different linear velocity of feed (0.01–0.05mL/min of acetic acid) under identical contact time (W/FA0) across the bed to eliminate the film diffusion. The feed flow rate was varied by adjusting the inert nitrogen flow rate at constant contact-time and 550°C temperature. The acetic acid conversion increased with total linear velocity in feed from 0.01 to 0.04mL/min, after which the conversion did not change appreciably indicating that mass transfer resistance did not affect the conversion. Beyond this flow rate of 0.04mL/min the rate of acetic acid conversion was almost constant for both the contact-times. Therefore all the kinetic data were collected at flow rates greater than 0.05mL/min where external mass transfer limitations did not prevail [24,26,28]. Further to eliminate the pore diffusion resistance, experiments were conducted using different sizes of the catalyst particles ranging from 0.2 to 1.5mm. The acetic acid conversion remains constant for the particle sizes smaller than 0.5mm, whereas acetic acid conversion decreased for the particle size greater than 0.5mm. Therefore an average particle size of 0.5mm corresponds to 20/25 mesh was selected for all the kinetic experiments where pore diffusion did not affect the kinetics of the reaction. The inert Pyrex quartz beads (20/25 mesh) to catalyst weight ratio were maintained at 2 to avoid any local temperature gradients in the catalyst bed. The catalyst temperature was maintained across the catalyst bed within 3°C difference. The exit hot gases from the reactor were cooled through condenser and the uncondensed products passed through dual chiller for better yield. Prior to all experimental run, synthesized calcined catalyst samples of (NC, NLA and NCCZ) were reduced in situ under a flow of H2 gas diluted in nitrogen at 565±5°C, 528±5°C and 561±5°C under 50% H2/N2 flow (120mL/min) for 6h respectively, which were confirmed from TPR analysis. After reduction, reactor temperature was kept constant during the whole experiment. The gaseous stream H2, N2, CO, CO2 and CH4 were analyzed with a gas chromatograph (Nucon 5700) equipped with a SS carbosphere column operating on TCD mode. The duration of each run was kept for 5h. Performance of a catalyst was compared based on the hydrogen yield, CO, CO2 and acetic acid conversion, etc. N2 gas was used as diluents at a flow of 45mL/min. The reforming tests were performed at constant space velocities. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) (defined as the volume of gas C1-equivalent species in the feed at standard temperature and pressure per unit volume of catalyst per hour) was 79.6g-cath/mole for acetic acid. The carbon balances in all experiments were 99±0.5%. The different terms associated are described below. Terms of product selectivity and product distribution were described for the catalytic steam reforming of acetic acid in these following Eqs. (5)–(8): (5) % H 2 yield = moles of H 2 in gaseous product 4 × moles of acetic acid fed × 100 (6) % selectivity of H 2 = moles of H 2 in gaseous product C atoms in gaseous phase × 1 RR × 100 where RR is H2/CO2 reforming ratio and RR=4/2. (7) % selectivity of ‘ i ’ = C atoms in species ‘ i ’ C atoms in gaseous phase × 100 (8) % AAc conversion = moles of AAc in − moles of AAc out moles of AAc in × 100"
8,Results and discussion,
9,BET surface area and BJH isotherm,"3.1 BET surface area and BJH isotherm The BET surface area, pore volume and the adsorption average pore diameter of the Ni–Co (1:4) (NC), Ni–Co/CeO2–ZrO2 (1.5:6:1:1.5) where 10wt% CeO2 and 15wt% ZrO2 (NCCZ), and Ni/La2O3/Al2O3 (1.7:1.5:6.8) (NLA), catalyst are shown in Table 1 . All metal composition in these three catalysts is specified in terms of their weight ratio. Metal dispersion was calculated from hydrogen chemisorption analysis, whereas Ni particle size was determined from XRD analysis applying Scherrer's equation. Table 1 depicts about the Ni–Co (NC) metal catalyst, which has a very low surface area because this catalyst is unsupported bimetallic. The ceria/zirconia supported NC catalyst has 20.3m2 g−1 surface areas due to the presence of ceria/zirconia support. The isotherm of NCCZ catalyst is shown in Fig. 1A where a hysteresis loop is observed, indicating the incorporation of nickel in the NC and NLA catalyst framework during its synthesis may lead to the irreversibility of adsorption–desorption behavior in its mesopores. Type IV isotherm is found for NC catalyst, characterized by a hysteresis loop displaced at higher p/p 0 values (0.6–0.77). The pore size distribution for these set of catalysts is shown in Fig. 1B. Both catalysts are characterized by ordered cylindrical pores, and show completely reversible Type IV isotherms, according to the IUPAC classification of adsorption isotherms, which is a typical characterization of mesoporous solids, with an inflection in the low relative pressure range (p/p 0 =0.10–0.25, in case of NC catalyst) [25]. This is a peculiar feature of Ni–Co materials, due to the primary mesopore filling step."
10,"Scanning electron microscopy, EDX-ray (SEM–EDX) and XRD analysis","3.2 Scanning electron microscopy, EDX-ray (SEM–EDX) and XRD analysis Supplementary Fig. S1(A–C) depicts about the quantitative analysis by EDX where different peaks were indicating the final weight % of metal loading for NC, NCCZ, and NLA catalysts. SEM micrographs of reduced NC, NCCZ and NLA catalyst at magnification of 10,000× are shown in Fig. 2(A–C). The mixture of nickel and cobalt metal particles can be clearly observed over ceria/zirconia support (Fig. 2B for NCCZ). At this magnification it is lucid to study the dispersion, which is in regular order. The mixtures of metal particles are present in spherical clusters while ceria/zirconia supported particles are present in form of lumps. Fig. 2A (NC) shows that nickel particles are not well dispersed on Co particles in Ni–Co catalysts. Nickel particles are smaller and present in irregular shape while Co particles are present in the form of lump. Supplementary Fig. S2(A–C) depicts the TEM micrographs of NC, NLA and NCCZ catalyst indicating that Ni particles are uniformly distributed over the support. In NLA, catalyst γ-alumina carrier is very distinct and spherical in shape and size. Nickel metal particles are present in spherical shapes over alumina support and these particles were found to be more regular at the surface of the sample, with a particle diameter range of 21–26nm. After reaction the composition ratio of Ni–Co was (28:72), which was (24:76) before reaction. It is indicating that the Ni species migrated and enriched on the catalyst surface during the reforming reactions, which is in agreement with the findings of Hu and Lu [18]. This phenomenon was due to the relatively small surface area of Ni than Co which renders significant portion of the metals under the surface of cobalt [24]. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns for three calcined catalysts. The XRD peaks in NLA at 2θ =43.4° show the presence of NiO phases (JCPDS-44-1159). Similarly in NCCZ catalyst the modification of Ce–Zr lattices, developed as a pseudo cubic lattice crystalline phase. In addition, no segregation of phases such as CeO2 or ZrO2 was detected, indicating the formation of homogeneous solid phase distribution. Some phases of Ni–Co interaction are observed at 2θ =44.06° in NC and NCCZ samples. NiO crystallites are observed for all three catalysts at different 2θ value as specified in Fig. 3."
11,Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA),"3.3 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) Thermogravimetric analysis was carried out to determine the calcination temperature of all three precalcined catalysts as shown in Fig. 4 . For fresh catalyst there was a sharp decrease in catalyst weight before 400°C, which infers that all undesirable complex, high volatile solvents present in the catalyst have been decomposed and evaporated. After 450°C, there is no such appreciable change in catalyst weight for NC and NCCZ, but for NLA this temperature was approximately near to 545°C, giving out complete oxidized catalyst. After experimental study the used catalysts were analyzed by TG-DTA to determine the carbon deposition and heat evolved/absorbed during gravimetric loss up to 1000°C. As the nickel loading increases from NLA to NC catalyst, only a low-temperature peak at 362°C (carbon T 362) was observed in the DTA curves for NCCZ catalyst, shown in Fig. 5 . Increasing the nickel loading to 20% a second high temperature peak at 418°C is developed (carbon T 418). The presence of two TG peak temperatures indicates that same types of carbon were deposited on both NC and NLA pores. The peak intensity of carbon T 362 and the peak position of carbon T 418 did not change as the nickel loading increased, but as higher for the nickel loading, the more carbon was deposited in the carbon T 418 formed, as depicted from the TG-DTA. It has been reported that some acetate species that accumulate during the steam reforming were remain stable up to about ±380°C. TG-DTA graph shown in Fig. 5 revealed that some of the species that accumulate on this catalyst may have a similar nature as acetate species which undergo decomposition with the help of O2 at elevated temperatures. The amount of coke formation is observed in all catalyst tested for 5h. Amount of coke are in the range of 6–16mgC/g-Cat/h."
12,Temperature programmed reduction (TPR),"3.4 Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) The reduction features of the catalysts were analyzed by TPR. For comparison, TPR analysis of NC, NCCZ and NLA were plotted combined. The TPR profiles of NCCZ catalyst (Supplementary Fig. S3) were differentiated by three peaks; one at 335°C for the reduction of CoO and another low intensity peak at 572 and 710°C corresponding to the reduction of bulk ZrO2 and CeO2 respectively. These results are in good agreement with the study of Biswas and Kunzru [22]. Due to the spillover effect and the gauss resolution of the Ni–Co catalyst, the TPR diagram indicates about the three different reduction temperatures for NiO species, which is in well agreement with the data reported by Yazhong et al. [23]. In Ni/La2O3/Al2O3 catalyst the TPR profiles indicate that the interaction between NiO and the support was very strong. Fig. S3 shows that there was no free NiO in the catalyst (NLA); however, NiAl2O4 was formed during the calcination. There are different types of NiO species generated depending on the methods of preparation technique. As wet impregnation method followed in NLA preparation, the first NiO, reducible in the temperature range of 520–540°C and the second NiO in the form of NiO·xAl2O3 (a small value of x, NiO rich) has mixed to form oxides at 728°C."
13,Reforming of acetic acid,"Experiments were conducted over different catalysts for their activity toward CSR of acetic acid. For oxygenated compounds the reaction is actually the sum of the steam reforming (Eqs. (1) and (3)) and water-gas shift reaction (Eq. (2)). Coking not only leads to lower hydrogen yields but causes severe deactivation, pressure drop and reactor blockage. Considering the thermal decomposition reactions scheme is given below (Eqs. (9)–(12)). (9) CH 3 COOH → 2 CO + 2 H 2 (10) CH 3 COOH → CH 4 + CO 2 (11) CH 3 COOH → C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 , C 3 H 4 , Coke , etc. (12) C 2 H 4 O 2 → C x H y O z + Carbon + Gases ( H 2 , CO , CO 2 , CH 4 , C x H x + 2 )"
14,Product selectivity,"4.1 Product selectivity The prepared catalysts such as NC, NCCZ and NLA were tested at a given feed concentration (15wt%) and space time (W/FA0 =53.3g-cath/mole). Hydrogen selectivity was highest in case of NC catalyst than other NCCZ and NLA catalysts, which were reproduced at same operating conditions shown in Fig. 6 . The result indicates that the Ni–Co (NC) catalyst is more active for H2 production in comparison to supported Ni–Co/CeO2–ZrO2 (NCCZ) and NLA catalysts. CH4 and CO product selectivity over different catalysts is also compared in Fig. 6. It is experiential that the selectivity of CO is nearly constant over all catalysts whereas the selectivity of CH4 is low for the Ni–Co (NC) bimetallic catalyst. The selectivity of H2 and CO2 over the Ni–Co catalysts is 2.6 and 1.6 respectively which are significantly higher than the other two catalysts. Over Ni–Co catalyst, CSR reactions are the dominant reactions than methanation or RWGS reactions; as a result, very little amount of by-products are observed. It indicates the side reaction which occurred along with the CSR reactions is not effective in the case of Ni–Co catalysts under these reaction conditions. Furthermore, the highest CO2 selectivity and the lowest CO selectivity are observed over Ni–Co catalysts implying that the WGS reaction occurred at very high rate along with steam reforming reactions. It might be due to presence of cobalt metal because metal loading of Co on Ni–Co catalyst was high (80%). It is also reported that cobalt has relatively higher activities for WGS reactions and its promotion [17,24,28]."
15,Effect of run time on acetic acid conversion,"4.2 Effect of run time on acetic acid conversion The activity of Ni–Co/CeO2–ZrO2 (NCCZ) supported catalyst decreased very fast than NC or NLA catalyst. NC catalysts showed an almost constant value of acetic acid conversion (90–96%) for total time on stream at 600°C. The results are shown in Fig. 7 for 4h run time. At some points it is also observed that the conversion of acetic acid increased with run time. It may be due to the gradual oxidation of deposited carbon molecules. Oxidations of deposited carbon lead to re-activation of the catalyst surface for H2 production. The results indicate the rate of carbon deposition over NC catalyst is pretty lower than its supported NLA and NCCZ catalyst at a specified reaction conditions. These results indicate the bimetallic catalyst compounds (NC) without support deliver higher rate of H2 production than ceria–zirconia supported NCCZ and alumina supported NLA catalyst. The ketonization reaction also occurs at temperatures below 800°C, over lanthanum which is used as a basic oxide. In presence of alumina the formation of ethylene and trace amounts of ethane are also detected in the product stream at temperatures above 850°C. This is due to the acidic sites of Al2O3, which promote decomposition reactions. This ability of Al2O3 to break the CC bond enhances the H2 production. Although the coke formation during acetic acid reforming is least significant and acetic acid conversion decreased with run time. The low S/C employed in endurance tests favored the production of by-products, which is due to the carbon precursors that have the probable occurrence for the disproportion of CO [18,26]."
16,Experiments using Ni–Co (NC) catalyst,"4.3 Experiments using Ni–Co (NC) catalyst 4.3.1 Effect of reaction temperature Fig. 8 depicts the conversion of H2 as measured with different temperature conditions over the suited NC catalyst. It is observed that reaction temperature has significant effect over H2 yield, in temperature range of 500–700°C. H2 yield continuously decreased from 1.36 to 0.43 in the temperature range of 500–700°C. When the temperature is higher than 700°C, the H2 yield gradually goes down for all sort of operating conditions. Theoretically, the ideal hydrogen yield for acetic acid feed is 3.5–4mole. Fig. 9 represents the conversion of acetic acid as a function of temperature. A significant increase in the conversion of acetic acid is observed as the temperature increased from 500°C to 700°C. As temperature increased from 500°C to 600°C, the conversion of acetic acid increases from 63% to 93% while it remained invariable nearly 96% for higher temperature. It is desirable to run the process in the temperature range of 500–600°C which is also thermodynamically favorable for higher H2 yield. As the reforming temperature increased, H2 yield and the carbon conversion are controlled by the reaction (2) reverse water gas shift (WGS) reaction and reaction (3), which leads to control both the formation of H2 and CO2. Temperature has significant influences on selectivity of gaseous products as shown in Fig. 8. At 500°C, the selectivity of CO is 0.12 but it decreased to 0.03 as temperature increased to 600°C. The reason for low amount of CO generation at 600°C, is due to the high temperature favorable for water gas shift (WGS) reaction simultaneously with (CSR) reaction (1). It might be due to methanation reaction of carbon monoxide [CO+3H2 ⇄CH4 +H2O]. It is also observed as temperature increased to 700°C, catalysts did not deliver optimum results in term of hydrogen selectivity. Selectivity of H2 decreased from 2.15 to 1.56 is due to the ineffective tendency of CSR at high temperature while selectivity of CH4 increased fairly to 0.6. Above 600°C temperature, selectivity of H2 and CO2 decreased to 0.58 and 0.91 respectively while selectivity of both CO and CH4 became remarkable. Sharp increase in the amount of methane is due to the methanation of CO [CO+4H2 ⇄CH4 +2H2O] or by the thermal cracking of oxygenated organic compounds at high temperature. The high amount of CO generated at 700°C than 600°C, is due to thermodynamic constraints. Selectivity of CO increased as temperature increased from 600°C to 700°C, due to the reverse water gas shift reaction which led to the formation of CO, shown in Fig. 9. Based on the results it might be the methanation, WGS and RWGS which favored the yield of CO and CH4 at higher temperatures. Thus Ni–Co catalyst is favorable at lower temperature below 600°C especially in range of 500–600°C. 4.3.2 Effect of space time (W/FA0) The effects of space time (W/FA0) on catalytic performance are shown in Fig. 10 . As the value of W/FA0 increased from 38 to 80g-cath/mole of acetic acid, conversion increased from 49% to 92.3%. It is observed that at higher value of space time (W/FA0), H2 yield was higher; however CO and CH4 decrease further. The selectivity of H2 and CO2 slightly increased to 2.31 and 4 respectively by increasing the value of W/FA0 from 38 to 53.33. Higher space time tends to decrease the selectivity of undesired gases such as CO and CH4. 4.3.3 Effect of feed concentration As acetic acid feed concentration increased from 15% to 20%, H2 yield decreased from 1.26 to 0.74 at the same operating conditions that are shown in Fig. 11 . Higher concentration of acetic acid in feed mixture is not much desirable for H2 production. So, for the optimization of H2 yield, most of the experiments were conducted at lower concentration of acetic acid (15%)."
17,Conclusion,"Steam reforming of acetic acid was performed in a fixed bed in the presence of a nickel–cobalt based catalyst. Among the three catalysts investigated Ni–Co (0.25:1) catalyst was found to be more effective for steam reforming of acetic acid as compared to Ni–Co/CeO2–ZrO2 and 17% Ni/La2O3/Al2O3. Selectivity of H2 and CO2 over Ni–Co catalyst was higher than Ni–Co/CeO2–ZrO2 and 17% Ni/La2O3/Al2O3. It implied that steam reforming reaction was the dominant reaction rather than the methanation or reverse WGS reactions over Ni–Co catalyst. Acetic acid conversion increased with increasing temperature, W/FA0 and contact time reached a maximum of 95±2% at a temperature of 700°C. Running the process at temperature of around 500–550°C is thermodynamically most favored for the reaction and gives the maximum hydrogen yield. The severe coking caused from thermal decomposition of the unstable oxygenates and via catalytic reactions imposes the use of fluid bed reactors for processing the aqueous fraction of the bio-oil. By combining a proper reactor design with catalytic materials can minimize the undesirable coke. So bio-oil has more prospective to be recognized as better feedstock for hydrogen production source with significant environmental benefits."
