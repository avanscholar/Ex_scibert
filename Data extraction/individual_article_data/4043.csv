0,Introduction,"Anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide have increased vertiginously in the last century. Despite the uncertainty about the consequences of this phenomenon in the long term, great part of the scientific community believes that increasing the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is closely linked to the recent global temperature increase. Thus, great efforts have been made to capture CO2 (Rivera-Tinoco and Bouallou, 2010) and re-inject it in the underground (Câmara et al., 2013), so as to minimise the increase of its concentration in the atmosphere. Approximately 40% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions originate from coal or natural gas power plants (Amann, 2007). Therefore, the capture of CO2 emitted by thermal power plants is of major importance. However, the costs of capture are still high since the reduction on the power plant efficiency caused by the CO2 capture unit is still considerable (Harkin et al., 2012). If the captured CO2 were used as raw material in the production of a marketable product, its capture and sale could become not only economically viable but also a profitable business. Another major challenge of this century is to substitute fossil fuels by renewable ones. Thus, the recycling of CO2 as a feedstock for the production of hydrocarbons substituents presents great economic and environmental interests. Methanol is widely used in the chemical industry, mainly in the production of formaldehyde, MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether) and acetic acid. Moreover, methanol has excellent combustion properties, which allows its use as a fuel in vehicles, although it has only about half the energy density of gasoline. Furthermore, methanol is less polluting than conventional fossil fuels (Olah et al., 2008). Methanol can be used in a wide range of concentrations mixed with gasoline, from small concentrations where it is an additive up to high concentrations such as the M85 (15% gasoline and 85% methanol). Vehicles fuelled by pure methanol (M100) are also viable and even more efficient (Olah et al., 2008). However, the toxicity of methanol is often cited as restriction for its use as fuel. Methanol is extremely toxic when ingested in large quantities, causing blindness and possibly death. DME (dimethyl ether), which is a possible substitute for conventional diesel, can be synthesized from the dehydration of methanol. Therefore, the production of methanol from captured CO2 may cause a reduction in the consumption of fossil fuels and enable CO2 recycling. The main objective of this study is to evaluate and quantify the abatement of CO2 through the production of fuel grade methanol by the process proposed in this paper."
1,Conventional methanol production process,"1.1 Conventional methanol production process Most of the methanol produced industrially today is derived from the catalytic conversion of synthesis gas (gaseous mixture of CO, CO2 and H2). Although it may be produced from various carbonaceous components, most of the synthesis gas currently produced is derived from natural gas. The commercial catalyst Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 is commonly employed in the production of methanol from synthesis gas. It allows the production of methanol under relatively “soft” conditions (210–270 °C and 50–100 bar), with a selectivity of 99% in relation to CO x (Ullmann, 2002). By-products produced are mainly higher alcohols, methane, methyl formate and DME. Considering the natural gas used as reagent and fuel, a typical plant consumes between 29 and 33 GJ of natural gas per metric ton of methanol produced (Uhde)."
2,CO2 to methanol process,"1.2 CO2 to methanol process 1.2.1 Overview Methanol can be produced from CO2 in two different ways: in one step or in two steps. The one step conversion is the direct hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. In two steps conversion, CO2 is first converted into CO through the Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS) reaction and then hydrogenated to methanol. In this paper, the conversion of CO2 in one step was employed. Some routes of conversion of CO2 to produce fuels are shown in Fig. 1 . The source of CO2 may be the flue gases from thermal power plants (e.g. coal, natural gas) or factories producing steel, cement and other major emitters of CO2. Hydrogen must be produced in a carbon-free way, such as biological production from algae or the electrolysis of water using carbon-free electricity (Demirci and Miele, 2013). Exothermic reactions (Eqs. (1) and (2)) produce methanol. The RWGS reaction (Eq. (3)) occurs in parallel. (1) CO ( g ) + 2 H 2 ( g ) ⇔ CH 3 OH ( l ) Δ H = − 128 kJ/mol ( 298 K ) (2) CO 2 ( g ) + 3 H 2 ( g ) ⇔ CH 3 OH ( l ) + H 2 O ( g ) Δ H = − 87 kJ/mol ( 298 K ) (3) CO 2 ( g ) + H 2 ( g ) ⇔ CO ( g ) + H 2 O ( g ) Δ H = + 41 kJ/mol ( 298 K ) The production of methanol from CO2 hydrogenation has been the subject of many recent studies. Joo et al. (1999) studied the production of methanol in two steps and concluded that it has a higher yield than the process in one step. Mignard et al. (2003) proposed a methanol synthesis process from CO2 captured from flue gas of a coal power plant and electrolytic hydrogen. The process depends on availability of waste heat in the power plant to provide thermal energy to the process in order to have a significant abate of CO2. In the absence of these thermal sources, CO2 abatement is almost null. Mignard and Pritchard (2006) compared the energy efficiencies of production processes of methanol, ethanol and gasoline from the CO2 hydrogenation. The methanol process showed the highest efficiency. Pontzen et al. (2011) carried out experiments to compare methanol from CO2 production over Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst with the conventional syngas production process. The CO2-based process showed lower productivities when compared to the conventional one. Soltanieh et al. (2012) studied and analysed economically the co-production of methanol and electricity from captured CO2 and carbon-free hydrogen. Van Der Ham et al. (2012) designed a CO2 to methanol process using a fluidised-bed membrane reactor. The process provided significant CO2 abatement, but did not present economic viability. 1.2.2 Catalysts The commercial catalyst Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 has been studied by several authors (Mignard and Pritchard, 2006; Mignard et al., 2003; Pontzen et al., 2011; Sahibzada et al., 1998) for the production of methanol from CO2, although it is less efficient with supply of CO2 than CO/CO2 (ADEME, 2010). Catalysts better adapted to CO2 feed have been extensively studied. In many cases, the proposed catalysts are based on Cu–Zn oxides containing additives such as ZrO2, GaO3 and SiO2 over alumina. Guo et al. (2011) investigated the effects of the procedure of preparation on the performance of a Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 catalyst. Zhang et al. (2006) studied the effect of zirconia addition on γ-Al2O3 support of a Cu based catalyst. Raudaskoski et al. (2009) reviewed papers about copper-based zirconia-containing catalysts. Chiavassa et al. (2009) studied the synthesis from Ga2O3–Pd/silica catalyst. Sahibzada (2000) reviewed kinetic results of Pd-promoted Cu/ZnO catalyst. 1.2.3 Installations Carbon Recycling International installed at the end of 2010 a unit capable of producing 3000 t/y of methanol in Iceland (ADEME, 2010). This unit have a capacity of about 10 t of methanol from 18 t of CO2 (Carbon Recycling International, 2009). The CO2 used comes from the Svartsengi geothermal plant and an aluminium production plant. Hydrogen is generated from the electrolysis of water using a renewable source of electricity. Mitsui Chemicals Inc. has a pilot unit in Japan capable of producing 100 t of methanol per year. CO2 used comes from an ethylene production plant of Osaka Works Petrochemical Complex (ADEME, 2010). The economic viability of plants depends on several factors, such as the price of a barrel of oil, electricity price, CO2 price and use of by-products."
3,Methods,"This paper proposes an enhancement of the process proposed by Van-Dal and Bouallou (2012), and also provides greater detail on the calculations as well as a deeper analysis. CO2 captured from flue gases of a coal power plant and hydrogen generated from water electrolysis are fed into a methanol plant. An overview of the process is presented on Fig. 2 . Electrolysis of water is carried out using carbon-free electricity source, such as renewable (e.g. hydraulic, eolic, solar or biomass) or nuclear. However, the CO2 capture unit and methanol unit are supplied with electricity from the coal power plant. Thus, hydrogen can be imported from somewhere where carbon-free energy is available and used in methanol plants installed in places where only fossil energy is available. Since renewable energies depend on climatic factors such as the wind and the average hours of sunshine to be viable, there is a limited number of places where they can be installed. The commercial software Aspen Plus™ V7.3 was used for process design and simulation. The process is fed with 88.0 t/h of CO2 and 12.1 t/h of hydrogen, i.e. stoichiometric feed. Redlich–Kwong–Soave equation of state with modified Huron–Vidal mixing rules (RKSMHV2) was used to calculate the thermodynamic properties of streams at high pressure (>10 bar). For streams at low pressure (<10 bar), NRTL-RK model was employed."
4,Water electrolysis unit,"2.1 Water electrolysis unit The energy consumption for the production of hydrogen by electrolysis of water (Eq. (4)) is equal to 4.8 kWhel/m3 (m3 at 0 °C and 1 bar) (AFHYPAC, 2011). The hydrogen leaves the electrolyser at 30 bar and 25 °C to be fed to the methanol plant. (4) H 2 O ⇨ H 2 + 1 2 O 2 A large amount of oxygen is also generated as a by-product of electrolysis. It could be sent to the power plant to carry out oxycombustion, which would increase the concentration of CO2 in flue gases and reduce the energy consumption of its capture. Another possible destination for the oxygen is its sale to a nearby chemical plant via pipelines. The second option was considered in this paper."
5,CO2 capture unit,"2.2 CO2 capture unit The CO2 capture unit considered in this paper was based on the work of Amann (2007). CO2 is captured by chemical absorption of the flue gases of a subcritical coal power plant with desulfurization. MEA (monoethanolamine) in a mass concentration of 30% is used as solvent. Fig. 3 shows the process of CO2 absorption with MEA and solvent regeneration by heating. The flue gases to be treated are compressed before the capture process to compensate the pressure drop in the absorption column. They are then introduced at the bottom of the absorption column whereas the solvent poor in CO2 is introduced at the top of the column. Throughout the column, MEA reacts with CO2. The gas recovered at the top of the absorption column contains low levels of CO2. The CO2-rich solvent leaving at the bottom of the absorption column is sent to the regeneration column after being preheated by the regenerated solvent that leaves the regeneration column. The regeneration column includes a reboiler and a condenser. The reboiler recovers the energy from the condensation of low pressure (LP) steam for reversing the reaction between the amine and CO2. The water vapour contained in the gas flow of the regeneration column is condensed and re-injected into the column. The regenerated solvent is fed back to the absorption column after having preheated the CO2-rich solvent. The gas recovered at the top of regeneration column is mainly composed of CO2 and water vapour. This gaseous flow is then completely dehydrated and compressed. Without CO2 capture, the net electrical power delivered by the power plant is 556 MWel with a CO2 emission ratio of 857 g/kWhel. The efficiency of the plant is 38.5% (Lower Heating Value). The flue gases come out at 95.2 °C and 0.913 bar, with the composition shown in Table 1 . Considering a CO2 capture rate of 85%, 44 kWhel per tonne of CO2 are consumed for feed compression and 3.2 GJth per tonne of CO2 are employed for solvent regeneration. LP steam used in the capture is bled from the steam cycle of the coal power plant. The fact of extracting a flow rate of 100 t/h of LP steam at 4.14 bar involves a decrease of 18.3 MWel in electricity production for the power plant (Amann, 2007). Since there is steam available in the methanol synthesis unit, this steam is used in the CO2 capture unit. Consequently, the amount of steam bled from the power plant is lower and so is its impact on electricity production. The steam provided by methanol synthesis unit corresponds to 36% of the thermal energy needed to CO2 capture. After capturing 88.0 t/h of CO2, the net electrical power delivered by the power plant is equal to 537 MWel with a CO2 emission ratio of 723 g/kWhel. An amount of about 1 kg of MEA per tonne of CO2 absorbed is necessary to compensate losses due to degradation and evaporation of the amine. The CO2 captured is fed to the methanol plant at 1 bar and 25 °C."
6,Methanol synthesis and purification unit,"2.3 Methanol synthesis and purification unit The process flowsheet is presented in Fig. 4 . The main improvements over the process published by Van-Dal and Bouallou (2012) are the optimisation of the number of compressors and also not considering perfect separation in the flash tank located before the distillation column. The reduction in the number of compressors, and hence in the number of heat exchangers, caused a decrease in capital cost without a large increase in energy cost. Furthermore, without considering perfect separation between liquid and gas in the flash tank has made the simulation of the distillation column more realistic since a fraction of gases was also considered in the feed of the column. 2.3.1 Flowsheet description CO2 is fed at 1 bar and hydrogen at 30 bar, both at 25 °C. CO2 is compressed to 78 bar in a series of compressors with intercooling. Hydrogen is compressed to 78 bar in a single stage. The two gases are mixed (MIX1) and then re-mixed with the recycle stream (MIX2). The stream is then heated (HX4) to 210 °C and injected into the fixed bed adiabatic reactor. The gases leaving the reactor are divided (DIV1) into two streams: the first (60% of initial stream) is used to heat the fresh feed (HX4), while the second is used in the reboiler (DT1REB) and also to heat the feed of the distillation column (HX5). The two streams are re-mixed (MIX3) and cooled to 35 °C by water (HX6). Water and methanol, which were condensed in exchanger HX6, are separated from the non-reacted gases in a knock-out drum (KO1). Some of the non-reacted gases (1%) are purged to minimise the accumulation of inerts and by-products in the reaction loop. The liquid stream leaving the knock-out drum (KO1), called crude methanol, is composed of methanol, water and residual dissolved gases. The crude methanol is expanded to 1.2 bar in two valves (VLV1 and VLV2). Then, the residual gases are almost completely removed in a flash tank (TKFL1). The remaining stream is heated to 80 °C in exchanger HX5, and then sent to a distillation column (DT1). The water comes out of the bottom of the column at 102 °C containing 23 wt-ppb of methanol. Methanol comes out of the top at 1 bar and 64 °C, in gaseous form, containing 69 wt-ppm of water and some non-reacted gases. Methanol is then compressed (CP7) and cooled (HX8) to 40 °C. In a knock-out drum (KO2), non-reacted gases come out of the top, and methanol product comes out of the bottom in liquid form. 2.3.2 Reactor The adiabatic reactor is packed with a fixed bed of 44,500 kg of Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 commercial catalyst. For this catalyst, the model proposed by Vanden Bussche and Froment (1996) is able to describe with good precision the reactions of methanol production and the RWGS reaction. The model assumes that the CO2 is the main source of carbon for the synthesis of methanol and that it does not cause direct inhibition of the reaction represented by Eq. (2), which was demonstrated by Sahibzada et al. (1998). In addition, the model considers the inhibitory effect of water formed by the RWGS reaction. The activation energies of reactions were readjusted by Mignard and Pritchard (2008) to better represent the experimental data, which also expanded the application range of the model up to 75 bar. The kinetic model used in this paper is that of Vanden Bussche and Froment (1996) with readjusted parameters of Mignard and Pritchard (2008) (Eqs. (5) and (6), in which pressures are expressed in bar and temperatures in K). The kinetic constants follow the Arrhenius law (Eq. (7)), its parameters are shown in Table 3 . The thermodynamic equilibrium constants are given by Graaf et al. (1986) (Eqs. (8) and (9)). However, the model as shown by Eqs. (5)–(9) could not be directly implemented in Aspen Plus because the software only accepts certain types of kinetic equations. Appendix A shows how the kinetic model was rearranged to allow the simulation of the reactor in Aspen Plus, and also its new parameters. The pressure drop in the fixed bed is calculated by the Ergun equation, already implemented in Aspen Plus. The characteristics of the catalyst are described in Table 2.

Although the production of by-products was not considered in this model, 0.4% of by-products can be expected mainly in the form of methyl-formate. 2.3.3 Distillation A distillation column is used to purify methanol. The column was simulated with the rigorous model RadFrac in Equilibrium mode of Aspen Plus. The column has 44 rectification and 13 stripping stages. The reflux ratio is equal to 1.2. The fluid used to recover energy from the condenser is air. If the production of by-products was considered in the reactor, substances such as methyl formate, DME, and other hydrocarbons and alcohols would be present in the feed of the distillation column. Therefore, a small amount of these substances would leave the column at the top with methanol. However, this would not preclude its use as fuel. 2.3.4 Heat exchanger network Pinch analysis is a systematic methodology to reduce energy costs in processes. It was developed in the late 70's by Bodo Linnhoff from UMIST (University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology) (Linnhoff and Flower, 1978). Kemp (2007) provides a comprehensive guide to pinch analysis, from the foundations to the advances made in recent years. Heat exchanger network design was based on pinch analysis performed with Aspen Energy Analyzer™ V7.1. To design the heat exchangers and calculate their pressure drops, the software Aspen Exchanger Design and Rating™ V7.1 was used. The cooling fluid used in heat exchangers HX1, HX2, HX3, HX6 and HX8 is water supplied at 28 °C. The pinch in exchangers HX1, HX2, HX3 and HX6 is 10 °C. Table 4 shows details about the heat duty and utilities for all heat exchangers of the process. 2.3.5 Steam and electricity generation Steam is generated from the combustion with air of the purge (stream 24) and the gaseous streams 30 and 38. These streams are composed essentially of hydrogen, CO, CO2 and methanol. Combustion reactions that take place are represented by Eqs. (10), (11) and (12). It was considered 85% of efficiency in the boiler. (10) H 2 + 1 2 O 2 ⇨ H 2 O (11) CO + 1 2 O 2 ⇨ CO 2 (12) 2 CH 3 OH + 3 O 2 ⇨ 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 O The Lower Heating Values are: H 2 = 121.0 MJ/kg, CO = 10.1 MJ/kg and CH3OH = 19.9 MJ/kg. The streams of hot water leaving the heat exchangers HX1, HX2, HX3, HX6 and bottom of the distillation column are mixed and used to generate electricity through an organic Rankine cycle. Fig. 5 shows the flowsheet of the organic Rankine cycle. The working fluid is the R245fa. The energetic efficiency of the cycle is 3% and the exergetic efficiency is 36.3%. The water enters the cycle at 85 °C and leaves it at 47 °C. Afterwards, water is fed into a cooling tower."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Mass and energy balances,"3.1 Mass and energy balances Table 5 shows the mass balance and Table 6 the energy balance. Table 5 shows that the yield is 0.67 t of methanol per tonne of CO2 supplied. The production of oxygen is 1.1 t per tonne of CO2 supplied. Considering an operation of 8000 h/y, the annual methanol production of the plant is equal to 470,500 t. Table 6 shows that water electrolysis corresponds to 97% of net electricity consumed by the entire process. Since the methanol synthesis unit does not need external heat input, all the steam produced by the combustion of streams 24, 30 and 38 is sent to the CO2 capture unit. Therefore, the amount of steam bled from steam cycle of the coal plant is 49.4 MWth instead of 77.7 MWth, i.e. 36%lower."
9,CO2 abatement,"3.2 CO2 abatement 3.2.1 CO2 emissions CO2 emissions occur in three different ways in the process: 1) CO2 rejected from methanol synthesis unit, 2) thermal energy consumption, 3) electricity consumption. The details are as follows. 1) The CO2 rejected by the streams 24, 30 and 38 of the methanol synthesis unit is shown in Table 5. 2) The methanol synthesis unit requires no external input of thermal energy. However, the combustion of the streams 24, 30 and 38 for the production of steam used in the capture unit emits CO2 due to CO and methanol combustion (Eqs. (11) and (12)). 3) The net consumption of electricity of the methanol synthesis unit is 17.6 MWel. After installing the capture unit, the rate of CO2 emission of the power plant is equal to 723 g/kWhel. Thus, the resulting emission from electricity consumption is 12.8 t of CO2 per hour. 3.2.2 Carbon credits Carbon credits are generated by the sale of by-product oxygen via pipeline to a nearby chemical plant, which uses O2 as feedstock. Oxygen is commonly produced from cryogenic air distillation in industrial plants. O2 production and compression to 35 bar consumes 0.42 kWhel per kilogram of O2 (Bolland and Sæther, 1992). Thus, if oxygen were produced using electricity from the coal power plant, CO2 would be emitted. Therefore, the carbon credits generated are equal to the amount of CO2 that would be released if the oxygen was produced through a cryogenic process using electricity from the coal plant. Since the production of oxygen is 96.0 t/h and the rate of CO2 emissions of the coal power plant equal to 723 g/kWhel, 29.2 t/h of carbon credits are generated. 3.2.3 CO2 balance CO2 balance is shown in Table 7 . Table 7 shows that, if the oxygen by-product is sold, the process presented in this paper may abate 1.6 t of CO2 per tonne of methanol produced. If it is not sold, the figure is 1.2 t of CO2 per tonne of methanol. The consumption of fossil electricity is the main cause of CO2 emissions in the process. If only 20% of the electricity used in electrolysis comes from the coal plant, CO2 balance becomes null (in the case where oxygen is sold). Therefore, for a significant CO2 mitigation it is necessary that hydrogen is produced through a carbon-free way. However, it is important to notice that hydrogen production can be carried out through any carbon-free process, and not necessarily water electrolysis. Since the whole process presented in this paper uses fossil energy, except for the water electrolysis unit, the methanol plant can be installed in any region where a thermal power plant exists, even if carbon-free energy is not available nearby. Thus, hydrogen can be produced in regions where renewable energy is available to be exported and employed in methanol plants."
10,Conclusions,"The impact of the CO2 capture unit on the power plant efficiency is remarkably reduced due to the steam supplied by the methanol synthesis unit, which corresponds to 36% of the steam used in CO2 capture. The CO2 balance shows that it is possible to abate 1.6 t of CO2 per tonne of methanol produced if oxygen by-product is sold, or 1.2 t if it is not. In both cases, carbon-free hydrogen must be employed. Thus, if a large flow of carbon-free hydrogen is available, the production of methanol may mitigate large amounts of CO2. The whole process uses fossil electricity, except for the hydrogen synthesis unit. So methanol plants are not limited to places where renewable energy is available for CO2 mitigation. Hydrogen can be generated in places where renewable energy is available and then exported to methanol synthesis plants."
