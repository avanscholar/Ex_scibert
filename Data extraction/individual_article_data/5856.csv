0,Introduction,"In recent years, great interest has been shown in the liquid–liquid equilibrium (LLE) and salting-out effect on the liquid–liquid equilibrium for various ternary systems. LLE [1–10] and salt effect [11–15] have been much used in chemical engineering processes and waste water treatment due to their application in industry and economical usage. In the process of evaluating solvent extraction, it is important that research into mixtures of furfuryl alcohol (FAL) with organic solvents be carried out. Thus, for the separation of FAL from aqueous solutions to be most effective, accurate data is vital [16,17]. FAL is an important chemical well known in the polymer industry. It is mainly used for the production of thermostatic resins, liquid resins (for strengthening ceramics), as well as in the production of various synthetic fibers, rubber-resins and farm chemicals. In addition, it is used as a chemical intermediate, employed for the manufacture of lysine, vitamin C, lubricants, dispersing agents and plasticizers [18]. Potentially, FAL can be used as a precursor for components in “P series” alternative fuels [19,20]. FAL is prepared from furfural by catalytic hydrogenation in gas or liquid phase [21]. If the hydrogenation of furfural is performed in water as a solvent, one possibility for separation of FAL from water is extraction [22]. However, furfuryl alcohol is a toxic component and may contaminate industrial wastewater. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) listed furfuryl alcohol as a carcinogen [23,24]. Due to the toxicity of furfuryl alcohol together with its adverse environmental impact, separation of furfuryl alcohol from water and wastewater, before its discharge, is highly important. Among the first to do research on liquid liquid equilibrium of furfuryl alcohol were Negadi et al. [17]. Wongsawa et al. also carried out an important research into liquid liquid equilibrium data of furfuryl alcohol with various organic solvents (MIBK, ethyl acetate, furfural or n-butanol) [15]. Many investigations into varying organic solvents have been undertaken for the separation of furfuryl alcohol from water. Nevertheless, more research needs to be assembled. As yet, research on LLE data for the systems containing FAL+water+n-butanol+NaCl has not been collated in the literature. In this paper, the solubility and tie-line data for the systems consisting water, FAL, n-butanol and various concentration of NaCl at T=298.15K and atmospheric pressure are presented. Using the tie-line data, separation factors and distribution coefficients were evaluated. The reliability of the experimental tie-line data was validated by the Othmer–Tobias [25], Hand [26] and Bachman correlation equations [27]. Both the UNIQUAC [28–31] and the NRTL [32–36] models were used to correlate the experimental LLE data."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The chemicals furfuryl alcohol and n-butanol were purchased from Sigma-Aldich and Erba Lachema Co. Ltd. Throughout all the experiments, distilled and deionized water was used. All materials received were used without any further purification. The chemicals used in this study along with literature values are listed in Table 1 ."
3,Apparatus and procedure,"2.2 Apparatus and procedure The experiments were carried out in an equilibrium glass cell. First, a certain amount of NaCl was weighed accurately in order to prepare a predetermined concentration of salt solutions. The mixtures prepared contained FAL, n-butanol, water and NaCl according to a certain ratio. Then, these mixtures were introduced into an equilibrium cell and stirred together to make sure that all components were completely mixed. Thereafter, they were kept for 2h to achieve equilibrium. Samples taken from the organic phase and the aqueous phase were analyzed by gas chromatograph. Finally, LLE data having different compositions were determined. The solubility data of the systems studied were obtained by cloud point method (direct measurement method in organic-rich and aqueous-rich phases at equilibrium). Samples were weighed by a digital analytical balance-MettlerToledo AE200 with an accuracy of ±0.0001g. The temperature of the systems was controlled by a water jacket that was checked using a digital thermometer (with an accuracy of ±0.1K). Mixtures of furfuryl alcohol and n-butanol were processed in closed glass cells and systematically titrated with water until they became turbid. The end point of titration was achieved when the mixtures remained turbid for 15min. During this period of time, the glass cells were agitated periodically to observe the turbidity. These procedures were carried out to determine the solubility curve of the organic-rich phase. All the assessments were repeated at least three times. Then, the known quantity of furfuryl alcohol was added to the mixtures which were again titrated with water until they became turbid, and the same end point of titration was taken. Likewise, the solubility curve of the aqueous-rich phase was determined using the binary mixtures of furfuryl alcohol and water. After reaching equilibrium compositions, the tie-line data were calculated at T=298.15K. The transition from homogeneous to heterogeneous state was achieved by adding more water into the mixtures. Thereafter, the mixtures were stirred repeatedly at 200rpm for 2h Then, the mixtures were centrifugated and left for 14h in order to fulfill separation. As a result, two equilibrium liquid layers were observed: organic-rich and aqueous-rich. Thus, first, the organic-rich phase was carefully withdrawn from the top layer of the glass cell by syringe and weighed. The aqueous-rich phase was also weighed and analyzed by gas chromatography. Finally, the compositions of all components were calculated directly based on these results. The ProSim program was used to plot triangular phase diagrams for all systems of LLE data."
4,Analysis,"2.3 Analysis The separated phases were analyzed by gas chromatography (Hewlett Packard 5890 Series II, with FID detector) using a glass column (1.4m×3mm) packed with 5% C20M+5% SE. The quantitative determination of the reaction samples was done by an external standard method using an aqueous solution of each sample with known concentration and response factor."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effect of temperature on LLE,"3.1 Effect of temperature on LLE The LLE data for the systems containing water+FAL+n-butanol were calculated at 298.15K to 328.15K at atmospheric pressure, respectively. The experimental data is shown in Table 2 . The plot of binodal curves at different temperatures is shown in Fig. 1 . Results indicate that the area of heterogeneity decreases when the temperature is increased. The area of the two-phase region depends on the mutual solubility of water and n-butanol [37]."
7,Experimental solubility and tie-line data,"3.2 Experimental solubility and tie-line data The LLE data for the systems containing water+FAL+n-butanol and varying concentration NaCl 5–15% (v/v) (T=298.15K and atmospheric pressure) is shown in Fig. 2 . Results show that enlargement of the two-phase region occurred when the concentration of salt in the initial aqueous phase increased. Thus, the concentration of NaCl is important for the two phase region of the studies systems. The tie-line data of these systems were measured at T=298.15K and atmospheric pressure. Mass fractions of NaCl (x s ) in the salt solutions were found to be 0%, 5%, 10% and 15% respectively. The corresponding triangular phase diagrams for these systems at T=298.15K are shown in Figs. 3–6 . The slopes of the tie lines express the fact that FAL is more soluble in n-butanol than in water. This is due to the intermolecular interaction of FAL with n-butanol and water. In water, furfuryl alcohol can form weak bonds with hydrogen atoms of water [16]. Generally, the volume of a soluble component in water relies on its intermolecular vigor."
8,Distribution coefficients and separation factors,"3.3 Distribution coefficients and separation factors Distribution coefficients (D) and separation factors (S) were determined from the experimental data to evaluate the effectiveness of the FAL extraction by n-butanol. The distribution coefficients (D) and the separation factor (S) were calculated by means of Eq. (1). (1) S = D 2 D 1 = w 23 / w 21 w 13 / w 11 where D 1 and D 2 are the distribution coefficients of water and furfuryl alcohol, w 13 and w 23 are the mass fractions of water and FAL in the organic-rich phase, and w 11 and w 21 are the mass fractions of water and FAL in the aqueous-rich phase. In Table 3 , distribution coefficients and separation factors for the systems are presented. In Fig. 7 , the results of the separation factors for the systems studied are given and are compared with or without salt. It is noted that the separation factors increased when the concentration of salt increased. Moreover, all separation factors are greater than 1 (S>1) for the systems studied. Yet, the separation factors, for these systems, change accordingly: 15% NaCl>10% NaCl>5% NaCl>0% NaCl. Thus, the effect of salt was more significant as the concentration of salt increased. It can be explained that salt ions in the aqueous solution solvated: water being the preferred component for solvation. In hydration theory [38], it is assumed that each salt ion binds with water molecules. This bound water was then unavailable as solvent for furfuryl alcohol. Therefore, furfuryl alcohol tends to be less soluble in water. Thus, results show that the enlargement of the two-phase region occurred when concentration of salt in the initial aqueous phase increased; adding salt to the system proved to be beneficial in the separation of FAL from water."
9,Correlation models,"3.4 Correlation models The LLE data for each system were correlated using the NRTL and UNIQUAC models at T=298.15K. The detailed descriptions of these models are given in Appendix A. In the present work, the alpha value was fixed at α = 0.2. The corresponding sets of NRTL and UNIQUAC binary interaction parameters were evaluated by minimizing the square of the differences between the experimental and calculated mass fractions. In the UNIQUAC model, the values r and q, used in these systems, are shown in Table 4 [39,40]. The binary interaction parameters for the systems were obtained by the Aspen Plus software program and regression with experimental LLE data. Both values for each system are shown in Tables 5 and 6 . The root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) value was determined accordingly as in Eq. (2): (2) rmsd = ∑ k = 1 n ∑ j = 1 2 ∑ i = 1 3 w ijk exp − w ijk cal 2 6 n where w exp is the experimental mass fraction, w cal is the calculated mass fraction, n is the number of tie-lines, and subscript i means components and j means phases and k = 1, 2,…, n (tie-lines). For the most part, rmsd values from the NRTL model are smaller than those obtained from the UNIQUAC model. The rmsd values evaluated by the NRTL model, for the systems containing 0% NaCl, 5% NaCl, 10% NaCl and 15% NaCl, were: 0.25%, 0.39%, 0.64% and 0.45%, respectively. Further, the rmsd values evaluated by the UNIQUAC model for the systems studied containing salt were: 0.25%, 0.41%, 0.78% and 0.94%, respectively."
10,Reliability of tie-line data,"3.5 Reliability of tie-line data The validity of the experimental tie-line data was validated by the Othmer–Tobias [25], Hand [26] and Bachman [27] correlation Eqs. (3), (4) and (5) respectively for the systems investigated: (3) ln 1 − w 33 w 33 = A + B 1 − w 11 w 11 (4) ln w 21 w 11 = A ′ + B ′ ln w 23 w 33 (5) w 23 = A ″ + B ″ w 23 w 11 where w 11 is the mass fraction of water in the aqueous-rich phase, w 33 is the mass fraction of the solvent in the organic-rich phase and w 21 and w 23 are the mass fraction of furfuryl alcohol in the aqueous-rich phase and the organic-rich phase. A, B,A′, B′,A″ and B″are parameters of the Othmer–Tobias, Hand and Bachman correlation equations. These parameters are numerical constants which depend on the type of ternary system and equilibrium component. In Table 7 , the parameters at T=298.15K are reported. The correlation factor (R 2 ) exhibits a good linear fit and indicates the effectiveness of the experimental tie line data obtained in this work."
11,Conclusion,"In this paper, the LLE data and the phase diagrams for the system FAL+water+n-Butanol+NaCl were obtained at 298.15K and atmospheric pressure. The results show that the salt effect on this system (i.e. addition of NaCl) is of prime importance. Without the addition of NaCl, the two-phase region of the system would be relatively smaller. The enlargement of the two-phase region, together with the decrease of solubility of FAL in the aqueous phase and solubility of water in the organic phase, occurs when the concentration of salt increased in the initial aqueous phase. The results indicate that the addition of salt is very helpful for separating FAL from water. The reliability of the experimental tie line data was validated by Othmer–Tobias, Hand and Bachman correlation equations. The experimental data was correlated by the NRTL and UNIQUAC models. The binary interaction parameters were estimated by the nonlinear least-squares method. Relative deviations between the experimental and calculated data were obtained. The results indicate that the NRTL and UNIQUAC models can be used for prediction of LLE data for the system FAL+water+n-Butanol+NaCl. Furthermore, determination of the NRTL and UNIQUAC parameters can help to choose a more suitable thermodynamic model for investigation."
