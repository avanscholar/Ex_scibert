0,Introduction,"In order to replace fossil energy, much attention has been paid to the resource that is abundant, environmentally friendly, and sustainable, among which lignocellulose is a promising feedstock. Compared with traditional fossil energy sources, lignocellulose, which includes wood, agricultural and forestry waste, has following advantages: (1) abundant storage; (2) wide distribution; and (3) low sulfur and nitrogen contents thus producing less pollution during processing (Dimitriadis & Bezergianni, 2017; Cao et al., 2017). Lignocellulose is a complex mixture of cellulose (40–50%), hemicellulose (20–35%), and lignin (20–40%), etc. The specific composition depends mainly on the species, and the components are connected mainly by ethers, esters, hydrogen, and C–C bonds, making the conversion relatively difficult. Hydrothermal liquefaction is an effective technology to convert it into liquid fuels and high-value chemicals. However, the mechanism of hydrothermal liquefaction of lignocellulose has been unclear due to the complexity of the structure and chemical composition of lignocellulose, which is not conducive to the control of the process. In order to better understand the complex mechanism, the three main components of lignocellulose (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) have been studied and discussed in depth. By gaining a deeper understanding of the liquefaction reaction mechanism, value-added applications of the liquefaction products can be realized. The macromolecular fraction of lignocellulose in HTL undergoes a series of complex reactions eventually generating bio-oil, aqueous phase products, gas phase products, and solid residues (Zhao et al., 2020). Compared with other conversion technologies, HTL has obvious advantages, since the process is based on a wide range of feedstock sources and can achieve the conversion without pre-drying the feedstock of a high water content (de Caprariis et al., 2017). HTL products have lower oxygen and moisture content, higher calorific value, and better stability than pyrolysis products (Yang et al., 2016). The energy density of bio-oil products from HTL process is significantly higher than that of pyrolysis oil (Lui et al., 2020). In addition, the yield and composition of HTL bio-oil are mainly determined by the reaction parameters (temperature, pressure, heating rate, reaction time, solid–liquid ratio, and catalyst, etc.) (Xue et al., 2016). By optimizing the reaction conditions, high quality bio-oil can be produced in an economical and sustainable way. According to the Web of Science database, about 100 papers were published on the liquefaction of lignocellulose or its components every year since 2015, of which HTL-related literature accounted for more than a quarter every year. It is evident that the fundamental research on HTL of lignocellulose has become one of the hotspots. Currently, the research on HTL is mainly conducted in the United States, China, and Canada, etc. Some excellent reviews on the liquefaction of biomass are available, and readers can refer to the literature (Basar et al., 2021; Beims et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2017; Gollakota et al., 2018). A comprehensive discussion of HTL of lignocellulose in terms of reaction mechanism, influence factors of the reaction and product utilization can provide the readers with core theoretical knowledge in this field. In view of the scarcity of information regarding this aspect, in this review paper, the chemical reaction mechanism of major components in the HTL of lignocellulose, the main influence factors of the reaction and the HTL products and their applications are discussed in detail. An outlook is included on the main challenges for HTL technology and the future research. This is meaningful for the fundamental research and industrial application of HTL of lignocellulose."
1,Liquefaction mechanism of lignocellulose,"Lignocellulose is primarily a complex mixture of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin components, each of which has a different reaction mechanism in HTL, making the HTL process particularly complex. The HTL reaction steps mainly include the depolymerization of lignocellulose, the decomposition of monomers, and the recombination of reaction intermediates (Basar et al., 2021). Lignocellulose depolymerizes to produce monomers, which form small fragments through decomposition reactions such as cleavage, dehydration, and decarboxylation; these fragments further yield hydrothermal products such as bio-oil, aqueous phase products, gas phase products, and solid residues through cyclization, condensation, and repolymerization reactions (Yang et al., 2019). HTL involves a variety of complex chemical reactions that generate abundant reaction products, making it difficult to establish accurate reaction mechanisms and kinetic models (Jindal & Jha, 2016b). To better understand the whole HTL process, the degradation pathways of main lignocellulosic components (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) and the liquefaction products have been extensively studied by many researchers (see supplementary material)."
2,Hydrothermal liquefaction of cellulose,"2.1 Hydrothermal liquefaction of cellulose Cellulose is a polymer composed of D-glucose units connected by β-1, 4-glycosidic bonds. In HTL process, cellulose decomposes into oligosaccharides and monosaccharides, and monosaccharides can be converted into aldehydes, furan derivatives and small molecular acids at high temperatures (Cao et al., 2017). Specifically, the main products of HTL of cellulose include glucose, fructose, erythrose, levoglucosan, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), ethanol aldehyde, glyceraldehyde, acetone aldehyde, dihydroxyacetone, and some oligosaccharides (e.g., cellobiose, cellotriose, and cellotetrose). In HTL, the reaction with water breaks the inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds of cellulose, resulting in the formation of glucose monomers (Obeid et al., 2020). The main reactions of glucose under hydrothermal conditions include: glucose isomerization to fructose by keto-enol inter-conversion, dehydration of glucose to produce 1, 6-anhydroglucose, decomposition of glucose to aldehydes and ketones by retro-aldol condensation, and dehydration of the interconversion intermediate and fructose to produce 5-HMF (see supplementary material) (Cao et al., 2015; Gagić et al., 2018). The HTL products and reaction pathways of cellulose depend mainly on the reaction conditions (Wang et al., 2019). When the react occurs at 400 °C for a relatively short time, only glucose is produced. As the reaction time increases, further retro-aldol condensation reactions occur to form products such as glycolaldehyde, pyruvaldehyde and glyceraldehyde. Buendia-Kandia et al. (2017) studied the influence of temperature on different cellulose hydrolysis reaction pathways and found that low temperature (180 °C) accelerated the production of oligosaccharides from cellulose, and due to the low kinetic rate of homogeneous hydrolysis at low temperature, oligomers with high polymerization in the liquid phase can be recovered. The intermediate temperature (220 °C) promoted the glucose and levoglucosan formation; for the reaction at a high temperature (260 °C) for less than 20 min, the secondary reaction led to the production of erythrose and acids. In addition, the cellulose HTL products varied with the pH of the reaction solvent. Under acidic conditions, the liquefaction products are mainly 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and levulinic acid; under basic conditions, the products are transformed into carboxylic acids, such as lactic and acetic acids; under neutral conditions, acidic and basic conversion products are formed because H2O undergoes self-dissociation at high temperatures, generating H+ and OH– (Mishra & Mohanty, 2020). Transition metal sulfates in catalysts can also alter the selectivity of glucose during HTL and promote the conversion of glucose to products such as lactic acid, levulinic acid, and formic acid. For example, Zn2+ and Ni2+ promote the conversion of glucose into lactic acid; Cu2+ and Fe3+ effectively convert glucose into levulinic acid and formic acid at high temperatures (Cao et al., 2015)."
3,Hydrothermal liquefaction of hemicellulose,"2.2 Hydrothermal liquefaction of hemicellulose Hemicellulose is a hetero-polysaccharide composed of monomers such as xylose, mannose, glucose, galactose, and arabinose, etc. Hemicellulose can be hydrolyzed into two major types of monosaccharides, pentose and hexose, which are further dehydrated to form furfural and 5-HMF. Hydrothermal degradation of hemicellulose includes the following reaction pathways: (1) sugar cleavage mainly produces alcohols and organic acids, (2) secondary reactions such as dehydration, oxidation, isomerization, and self-lactonization occur between alcohols and organic acids, (3) formation of macromolecular fragments from sugars through deoxygenation, oxidation, and self-lactonization, and (4) a small amount of esterification and condensation reactions occur between hemicellulose and lignin fragments (Gao et al., 2016). Xylose in lignocellulose is usually present as pyranose, furanose or open ring forms. Studies have shown that furfural is mostly generated by the conversion of pyranose type xylose, while degradation products such as lactic acid, formic acid, glyceraldehyde, and acetone aldehyde are generated through the conversion of the open-ring form of xylose (de la Concepcion et al., 2020). Xylose undergoes mainly isomerization, dehydration, retro-aldol condensation, and gasification reactions in subcritical and supercritical water. In the reactions, formic acid and organic carbon are vaporized, while dihydroxyacetone, formaldehyde, and acetic acid are stable and do not decompose to obtain gas phase products (Paksung et al., 2016). Paksung and Matsumura (2015) studied the decomposition reaction of xylose at 300–450 °C and 25 MPa and found that xylose decomposes rapidly, and xylose was detectable only reaction at below 300 °C, and furfural, retro-aldol condensation products and organic acids are the main liquid intermediates. The reactions can be divided into ionic and free radical reactions according to the effect of temperature. Under subcritical conditions, ionic reactions dominate in favor of xylose dehydration and furfural is the predominant liquid product. Under supercritical conditions, free radical reactions dominate, favoring retro-aldol condensation with high yields of glycolaldehyde. Yoon et al. (2016) performed kinetic analysis of tulip xylan hydrolysis at 180–220 °C and showed that in a semi-continuous reaction system, low temperature and short processing time could achieve high xylan conversion and high yield of oligosaccharides (up to 95%). The liquefaction mechanisms of other monosaccharides comprising hemicellulose are similar under hydrothermal conditions, for example, the liquefaction products of glucose, fructose, mannose, and galactose are mainly ethanol aldehyde, glyceraldehyde, and furfural. Pedersen and Rosendahl (2015) investigated the effect of lignocellulosic biomass on bio-oil formation and composition, and found that the bio-oil properties obtained from the reactions of glucose and xylose were close, inferring that glucose and xylose underwent similar reactions."
4,Hydrothermal liquefaction of lignin,"2.3 Hydrothermal liquefaction of lignin Lignin is an amorphous aromatic polymer compound with anisotropic properties formed by the association of benzene propane units through different linkages (ether and carbon–carbon bonds), and its three basic units are the p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) units. Compared with cellulose and hemicellulose, lignin has a complex structure and a wide range of molecular weight distribution (Sun et al., 2018). The HTL of lignin allows the formation of oligomers, dimers, and monomers, which in turn catalyze the conversion of lignin into various aromatic chemicals. The effect of lignin species, catalysts, and other conditions on the products of HTL has been investigated in the literature, and the results showed that the yield and distribution of degradation products are mainly related to the structural changes of lignin (Cao et al., 2020). The degradation of lignin during HTL mainly includes: hydrolysis, breakage of ether and carbon–carbon bonds, breakage and degradation of methoxy on the benzene ring, and alkylation of groups on the benzene ring (see supplementary material) (Cao et al., 2016). Under HTL conditions, lignin undergoes hydrolysis and cleavage through ether bonds (β-O-4, α-O-4, α-O-γ, 4-O-5, etc.) and carbon–carbon bonds (β-β, β-5, 5–5, etc.) to form various phenolic compounds. With increasing temperature, the products are further hydrolyzed, demethoxylated, and alkylated to produce alkylated aromatic hydrocarbons and aromatic oligomers by condensation (Cao et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2018). In addition, the re-polymerization of lignin HTL intermediates results in the formation of large amounts of coke. In order to achieve effective conversion of lignin, it is particularly important to inhibit condensation during HTL (Cao et al., 2018). Due to the complexity of the chemical structure of lignin, researchers mainly focused on some phenolic model compounds such as guaiacol, catechol, vanillic acid, diphenyl ether, and benzyl phenyl ether. The hydrothermal conversion of three lignin model compounds (vanillin, monobenzone, and 2, 2′-bisphenol, representing the methoxyphenol unit, ether bond, and carbon–carbon bond of lignin, respectively) at 370 and 390 °C, 25 MPa, and 5–40 min were investigated by Barbier et al. (2012). It was shown that the aromatic ring was generally unaffected by the hydrothermal reaction, while the ether bond among the linkage bonds was more easily broken than the carbon–carbon bond under HTL conditions. The reaction pathways of lignin under hydrothermal conditions are competitive cleavage (hydrolysis of ether bonds) and condensation reactions (aromatic ring alkylation of intermediate products). Lignin depolymerization under HTL conditions occurs mainly through the breaking of ether bonds, and the α-O-4 is the most unstable bond type (He et al., 2014). To better understand the reaction mechanism of lignin during hydrothermal process, Lui et al. (2020) elucidated the reaction pathway of α-O-4 aryl ether bond under hydrothermal conditions using model compounds with substituents. The results showed that alkyl groups on the α-carbon and methoxy on the benzene ring significantly increased the conversion rate of α-O-4 bonds. α-O-4 aryl ether bonds were catalytically hydrolyzed and eliminated via OH– and H3O+, and the main products formed were phenolic and alkenyl benzene derivatives. Anisole, diphenyl ether, and phenethyl phenyl ether were chosen as model compounds representing lignin methoxy, 4-O-5 and β-O-4 bonds to investigate the mechanism and pathway of lignin hydrothermal reactions. It was found that at 260 to 290 °C, diphenyl ether were stable, while anisole and phenethy phenyl ether underwent degradation. Under hydrothermal conditions, the α-O-4 bond in the lignin ether bond was preferentially cleaved, the β-O-4 and methoxy bonds break less, while the 4-O-5 bond is more stable (Wu et al., 2013). Nagel and Zhang (2019) studied the hydrothermal decomposition of β-O-4 lignin dimer at 175 °C under different concentrations of hydroxide and carbonate. The results showed that weak alkaline conditions can effectively cleave the β-O-4 bond with guaiacol as the major product and vanillin and acetovanillone as the minor products. In addition, β-O-4 lignin dimer degradation pathways have been identified. β-O-4 lignin in neutral mainly forms quinone methide before cleaved; it is converted to stable vinyl ethers and highly unstable homovanillin in alkali. The α-O-4 model compounds in diaryl ethers under hydrothermal conditions undergo depolymerization at mild conditions of 140–300 °C and 5–80 min, whereas the model compounds of β-O-4 undergo conversion at temperatures above 340 °C and 240 min, with the hydrolysis rate of α-O-4 bond being faster than that of β-O-4 bond. It was shown that the presence of methoxy functional groups on the aromatic ring reduced the temperature and shortened reaction time required to break the α-O-4 and β-O-4 ether bonds, making them easy to depolymerize. The degradation temperature for α-O-4 structure is lower than that of methoxy, and the temperature can be adjusted during lignin decomposition to reduce secondary reactions (Alam et al., 2018)."
5,Process parameters of hydrothermal liquefaction,"The product distribution, composition, and properties of HTL depend primarily on the process parameters of the reaction, thus the optimization of the process parameters can help to achieve high yield and quality of bio-oil. To achieve efficient production of bio-oil, process parameters of HTL (such as lignocellulose type, reaction temperature, holding time, heating rate, solid-to-liquid ratio, pressure, and catalyst, etc.) have been extensively investigated (Table 1 )."
6,Types of lignocellulose,"3.1 Types of lignocellulose The yield and composition of bio-oil (as the main product) are closely related to the composition of lignocellulose. Studies have shown that cellulose and hemicellulose have higher bio-oil conversion rates compared to lignin, and therefore lignocelluloses with more cellulose and hemicellulose yield more bio-oil. This is primarily because lignin has a more stable structure than other components and therefore it is less likely to degrade and liquefy to form bio-oil, whereas cellulose and hemicellulose have simple structures and are less stable and therefore more prone to degradation and liquefaction (Xue et al., 2016). Feng et al. (2014) treated white birch bark, white spruce bark, and white pine bark in ethanol–water (50:50 v/v) at 300 °C for 15 min. The results showed that lower lignin content and higher ash content feedstock could effectively increase the conversion rate and bio-oil yield of the feedstock, with 67% bio-oil yield from liquefied white birch bark, followed by white spruce bark (58%) and the lowest (36%) from white pine bark. However, lignin can be degraded at higher temperatures due to its higher thermal stability compared to other components of lignocellulose. Chan et al. (2015) performed HTL of oil palm biomass at 390 °C, where the highest bio-oil yield of 38.53% was obtained from palm husk, which had the highest lignin content. It was shown that the main component of bio-oil was phenolic compounds (more than 72.86%), therefore lignin dominated in the production of bio-oil by high temperature degradation. The bio-oil yields of different lignocellulosic feedstocks under different HTL conditions are shown in Table 2 ."
7,Reaction temperature,"3.2 Reaction temperature The reaction temperature is a major parameter in the HTL of lignocellulose, and the properties such as elemental composition and calorific value of bio-oil are connected to the reaction temperature. Many HTL experiments were conducted at different temperatures to study the effect of reaction temperature on bio-oil. Wu et al. (2019) liquefied eucalyptus in subcritical water and supercritical ethanol at 260–320 °C for 30 min and found that the bio-oil yield increased gradually from 260 to 300 °C, and the highest yield (30.1%) was obtained at 300 °C; when the temperature exceeded 300 °C, the bio-oil yield gradually decreased. Corn straw was hydrothermally liquefied at an initial pressure of 4 MPa and a retention time of 15 min. When the HTL temperature was increased from 260 to 300 °C, the bio-oil yield increased to 32.52%, and when the liquefaction temperature was further increased to 320 °C, the bio-oil yield decreased significantly, while the yield of by-products (biochar and gaseous products) increased (Zhang et al., 2020). HTL of poplar at 220–280 °C for 30 min showed that the yield of bio-oil first increased and then mildly decreased, with the highest bio-oil yield (19.88%) at 260 °C. In addition, the highest C content of 69.13% and the highest calorific value of 27.97 MJ/kg were obtained for heavy oil at 260 °C (Wu et al., 2018). Birch was subjected to HTL at different temperatures (200–340 °C) at an initial pressure of 5.0 MPa, a catalyst of NaOH, and a holding time of 40 min. The increase in reaction temperature facilitated to increase the bio-oil yield, in which the highest yield of 53.9% was obtained at 300 °C with a maximum energy recovery of 68.8%. The amount of solid residue and gas phase products increased with rise in temperature, and excessive elevation in reaction temperature was detrimental to bio-oil formation (Malins, 2017). It was shown that bio-oil yield first increased with increasing reaction temperature and then decreased with further increase in reaction temperature. When the temperature is below the sub-critical temperature of water, ionic reactions (hydrolysis and dehydration) are favored, and the increase in temperature leads to the gradual breakage and decomposition of the main components of lignocellulose into small molecules, and the condensation of small molecules increases the bio-oil yield. When the reaction temperature exceeds the critical point of water, the increase of reaction temperature leads to the polymerization of large molecules of bio-oil into coke or decomposition into gaseous products, which decreases the yield of bio-oil (Islam et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2015). Decomposition reactions predominate when the reaction temperature is below the critical temperature of water; repolymerization reactions predominate when the reaction temperature is above the critical temperature of water (Cao et al., 2017; Xue et al., 2016). Considering the cost and yield, the production of bio-oil is inappropriate at high temperatures."
8,Heating rate,"3.3 Heating rate Heating rate is an important parameter that affects the HTL of lignocellulose. A high heating rate favors higher bio-oil yield, while a lower heating rate leads to polymerization reactions, resulting in more coke. Brand et al. (2014) explored the effect of heating rate (2–20 °C /min) on the biomass liquefaction when red pine wood and cellulose were liquefied in water and ethanol. It was shown that a high heating rate was favorable to increase the conversion of lignocellulose in subcritical water and the yield of bio-oil. The effect of heating rate on the hydrothermal process depends on the reaction temperature (250–350 °C) and the retention time (1–40 min). In the temperature range of 250–280 °C, the heating rate showed no significant effect on bioconversion and bio-oil yield; when the temperature was increased to 315 °C, a high conversion rate was obtained at a heating rate of 20 °C /min with a bio-oil yield of 27 %. It was found that the properties of degradation products in HTL are relatively stable and the heating rate had little effect on the distribution of liquefied products (Jindal & Jha, 2016b). Oliveira et al. (2017) investigated palm fiber liquefaction in ethanol solvent and found that temperature was the main factor affecting the yield and performance of bio-oil, while heating rate had no significant influence on bio-oil. A high heating rate helps to shorten the reaction time and achieves high biomass yields, which are suitable for continuous flow reactions. HTL in a continuous system can reduce coke formation and reactor plugging problems by rapid heating. However, higher heating rates can significantly increase equipment costs due to the strict requirements for reactor (Basar et al., 2021). In addition, high heating rates can accelerate the decomposition reaction and produce large amounts of gas phase products. Therefore, an appropriate heating rate needs to be maintained during the liquefaction of lignocellulose (Xue et al., 2016)."
9,Retention time,"3.4 Retention time Holding time is one of the HTL reaction parameters that can change the conversion of lignocellulose, bio-oil yield and product composition. In the HTL of lignocellulose, short retention time mainly leading to the decomposition reaction and the bio-oil yield increases with the increase of the retention time. Longer retention time can intensify the condensation reactions, resulting in the cracking of bio-oil or causing intermediate products to form gas or re-polymerize to produce coke, thus decreasing the bio-oil yield. Yang et al. (2016) investigated the HTL of spent coffee grounds by increasing the retention time from 5 to 30 min. The results suggested that the bio-oil yield increased to 31.63% as the holding time was increased to 10 min; when the retention time was extended to 30 min, the bio-oil yield decreased to 22.68%, the average relative molecular mass of bio-oil decreased to 433 g/mol, and the yield of water-soluble and gaseous products increased to 52.62%. It was demonstrated that complete decomposition of biomass could be achieved when the retention time was 10 min, and the bio-oil decomposed into smaller and lighter products and gases when the reaction time was prolonged. In addition, the solid residue yield increased slightly with increasing holding time, which may be due to the re-polymerization of bio-oil to form solid residue. In addition, studies have shown that retention time is closely related to temperature. Li et al. (2013) researched the influences of reaction temperature, solid-to-liquid ratio and residence time on the liquefaction behavior of rice straw. It was shown that holding time affected the conversion and bio-oil yield of rice straw differently under different temperature conditions. At low temperatures, gas and liquid product yields and biomass conversions were first increase and then decrease with increasing holding time; at high temperatures, gas and liquid product yields and biomass conversions fluctuated with the change of holding time. In addition, it was concluded that the biomass conversion was lower in shorter time at low temperatures, while the long reaction time led to the condensation of small molecules into coke. Cao et al. (2017) concluded that the holding time could be shortened at higher reaction temperatures, which was beneficial to reduce the formation of coke. Therefore, comprehensive factors need to be considered when establish the optimal holding time."
10,Pressure,"3.5 Pressure In the HTL process, high pressure leads to water existing in a single phase in subcritical and supercritical states, which can avoid energy loss due to phase change of water and thus reduce energy consumption. The increased density of water under high pressure conditions makes it easier to penetrate into lignocellulose, which promotes the decomposition of lignocellulose and improves bioconversion (Durak & Aysu, 2016). However, high-pressure conditions are usually accompanied by high temperatures, which affects the economics of hydrothermal processes. Researchers investigated the effect of pressure (200 ∼ 400 bar) on HTL and showed that there was no significant impact on bio-oil yield at pressures above the critical value (221 bar) (Basar et al., 2021). Pistachio shells were liquefied in an autoclave at 10–30 MPa, and it was found that biomass conversions lightly changed when the pressure was increased from 25 MPa to 30 MPa. This may be due to the fact that the enhanced solvent effect at high pressure inhibits the free radical reaction, which will reduce the decomposition reaction rate and lead to an incomplete liquefaction reaction (Karaca & Bektas, 2017). In addition, Cao et al. (2017) concluded that the reaction temperature and pressure during HTL are highly correlated. The increase in temperature has caused an increase in pressure and the process triggers the condensation of intermediates, producing more coke; a decrease in temperature leads to a reduction in reaction pressure and incomplete decomposition of lignocellulose, reducing the yield of bio-oil."
11,Solid-to-liquid ratio,"3.6 Solid-to-liquid ratio The mass ratio of lignocellulose to solvent is an important parameter for product yield during HTL. Water is the most commonly used solvent for lignocellulosic biomass liquefaction during the degradation of biomass. Studies have shown that low water content results in lower conversion of lignocellulose and bio-oil yield, mainly because high solid-to-liquid ratio is not favorable for the dissolution of lignocellulose in water and inhibits the hydrolysis and liquefaction reactions of the feedstock. The increase in water content facilitated the dissolution of lignocellulose, provided a source of hydrogen to stabilize the liquefaction intermediates, inhibited the production of solid residues and gases, and improved the yield of bio-oil (Jindal & Jha, 2016a). Spent coffee grounds was liquefied at solid–to-liquid ratios of 1:5–1:20, and the results showed that the bio-oil yield increased from 35.29% to 47.28% and solid residue decreased from 31.34% to 17.33% as the ratio was reduced from 1:5 to 1:20 (Yang et al., 2016). This is due to the fact that a low water content causes inadequate mixing of water and reactants, which affects the heat and mass transfer in the reactor and slows down the decomposition process; a higher water content accelerates the dissolution and hydrolysis of the feedstock, leading to an increase in feedstock conversion and bio-oil yield. The effect of the ratio of water to corn straw on the yield of liquefied products was investigated by Liu et al. (2013). The yield of bio-oil increased from 19.6% to 33.9% when the ratio was reduced from 1:6 to 1:10, and decreased slightly (31.2%) when the ratio was further reduced to 1:14. The results proved that higher water content contributed to the increase of bio-oil yield. The bio-oil yield decreases when there is an excess of water, which may be related to the competition between hydrolysis and re-polymerization reactions. In addition, HTL consumes a lot of energy and cost, so a greatly reduced solid-to-liquid ratio is not beneficial to the production process (Jindal & Jha, 2016b). Therefore, a suitable solid-to-liquid ratio is of great importance for HTL of lignocellulose."
12,Catalyst,"3.7 Catalyst Catalysts promote the decomposition of lignocellulosic macromolecules and inhibit the side reactions such as condensation and repolymerization of intermediates, as well as reduce the solid residue yield and increase the yield and calorific value of bio-oil. Currently, catalysts used in lignocellulose HTL processes include homogeneous catalysts (e.g., soluble acids, bases, and alkali salts, etc.) and multi-phase catalysts (e.g., metal catalysts or loaded catalysts). Table 3 summarizes the effects of homogeneous and multiphase various catalysts on HTL of lignocellulosic biomass. 3.7.1 Homogeneous catalysts Homogeneous catalysts, which mainly include acids, alkalis and alkali salts, are effective in catalyzing the HTL, in which the most commonly used acid catalysts are hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid. The liquefaction of bamboo shoot shells in the presence of H2SO4 catalyst (1–6%) showed that the biomass conversion increased from 44.99% to 98.74% when the H2SO4 content was increased from 1% to 5%. The conversion rate slightly decreased when the catalyst content continued to increase (Ye et al., 2014). A small amount does not ensure the decomposition of the reaction, while too much inhibits the reaction. Although acid favors the conversion of lignocellulose, it corrodes equipment (Cao et al., 2017). In addition, acidic conditions lead to condensation and re-polymerization reactions of intermediates, reducing the yield of bio-oil (Basar et al., 2021). In contrast, alkaline catalysts are more suitable for the liquefaction of lignocellulose. Lignocellulose contains carbohydrates that produce organic acids during HTL, and the presence of an alkaline catalyst neutralizes the hydrothermal products, inhibiting the repolymerization reactions of intermediates and favoring the yield of bio-oil. The most commonly used alkaline catalysts include NaOH, KOH, Na2CO3, and K2CO3 (Dimitriadis & Bezergianni, 2017). Birch wood was liquefied under different catalysts and the results showed that the highest energy recovery (68.4–68.8%) and bio-oil yield (48.6–53.9%) were achieved with alkaline catalysts (Na2CO3 and NaOH) (Malins, 2017). Pine was liquefied under different catalysts (alkali salts and acidic zeolites) and the results showed that the highest bio-oil yield was obtained when K2CO3 was used as a catalyst, zeolites were second only to K2CO3 as an acidic catalyst, while FeSO4 showed the worst bio-oil production performance. For alkaline catalysts, K2CO3 had better performance than KOH for bio-oil production. This may be due to the fact that K2CO3 can form other alkaline compounds in water as co-catalysts, which can effectively increase the bio-oil production (Wang et al., 2013). 3.7.2 Heterogeneous catalysts The commonly used heterogeneous catalysts are mainly metal catalysts (Fe, Pd, Ru, Co, Mo, Ni, and Pt, etc.) and loaded catalysts (Al2O3, SiO2, C, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and zeolite carriers, etc.) in the HTL. In HTL of lignocellulose, the addition of heterogeneous catalysts has an important impact on bio-oil yield and quality. Sorghum bagasse was hydrothermally liquefied under different catalysts (Ni/Si -Al, Ni2P, formic acid, KOH, K2CO3, and zeolite) and the results showed that Ni/Si-Al, KOH, and K2CO3 were the three excellent catalysts, and the yield of bio-oil was 45.0% when Ni/Si -Al was used. It was shown that Ni/Si-Al as a catalyst had the highest hydrocarbon content (5.3%) during HTL, which may be due to the fact that Ni facilitates the binding of hydrogen molecules and leads to oxygen removal (Bi et al., 2017). Ru/C catalyst as a loaded catalyst can effectively increase bio-oil yield and reduce solid residue production. Hibiscus cannabinus L. achieved bio-oil yields of up to 72.7% by HTL with Ru/C catalysts (Meryemoglu et al., 2014). Chen et al. (2021) investigated the hydrothermal liquefaction of corn straw under different catalytic systems and temperatures. The results showed that the Nano ferrite/inorganic base dual-catalytic system could effectively promote the low-temperature degradation of corn straw, and the ZnFe2O4 catalyst system promoted the preparation of heavy bio-oil, reaching a maximum yield of 34.02% at 180 °C. Fe is an environmentally friendly and easily recoverable metal under HTL conditions. de Caprariis et al. (2019) added iron powder to oak for HTL reaction and the addition of Fe catalyst led to an increase in bio-oil yield to 37%, an increase in hydrogen content, a decrease in O content, and a calorific value of 32.4 MJ/kg. Under HTL conditions, Fe catalyst undergoes the following reaction: 3Fe + 4H2O → Fe3O4 + 4H2, in which Fe is oxidized by water to Fe3O4, and H2 is produced in the process. Fe3O4 is catalytically active, while the hydrogen produced inhibits the cyclization and re-polymerization of bio-oil precursors, and the combined effect of these reactions effectively increases the bio-oil yield and reduces the residue content. Zhao et al. (2021) examined the effect of metallic Fe on bio-oil production from cornstalk under different conditions. The results of the study showed that Fe contributed to both the yield and quality of bio-oil. The highest biomass conversion of 95.29% and the highest bio-oil yield of 50.46% were achieved with the addition of 10% Fe at 300 °C and 30 min. Therefore, the development of an environmentally friendly and efficient catalyst that can be reused in the HTL process is crucial for bio-oil production and is of vital importance for commercial application of HTL of biomass (Basar et al., 2021). Although the use of catalysts has been extensively studied, their specific effects on the hydrothermal liquefaction process are unclear. Therefore, more research on the catalytic effects of catalysts is needed to achieve further comprehensive development of hydrothermal liquefaction. The bio-oil yield and quality of hydrothermal liquefaction processes depend mainly on reaction parameters. Extensive experimental studies have been conducted to determine the optimum conditions for various reaction parameters. From the discussed results, it is evident that the optimal conditions for hydrothermal liquefaction and bio-oil yield are highly dependent on the lignocellulose type. Reaction time and temperature have obvious impact on the hydrothermal liquefaction reaction. The optimum values of other hydrothermal liquefaction conditions also vary depending on the lignocellulose type. The addition of suitable catalysts has the potential to reduce the required temperature and pressure while improving the yield and quality of bio-oil. At present, studies of optimal hydrothermal liquefaction conditions are still limited and more comprehensive experimental designs and statistical methods are needed to optimize lignocellulose hydrothermal liquefaction."
13,Hydrothermal liquefaction products and applications,"Bio-oil, solid residue, aqueous phase product, and gas phase product are produced from lignocellulose under HTL conditions. Among the four products, bio-oil as the main product can be further upgraded to biofuel or bio-based chemicals through reactions such as catalytic cracking and hydrogenation, solid residue can be used as carbon material through treatment, aqueous phase product can be converted to biogas through anaerobic digestion, and gas phase product can be used as fuel gas (Fig. 1 )."
14,Bio-oil,"4.1 Bio-oil Bio-oil produced from lignocellulose is a dark brown viscous fluid containing a variety of organic compounds (e.g., alkanes, olefins, aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, organic acids, furans, ketones, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, and phenols) (Taghipour et al., 2019). Bio-oil is similar to crude oil in terms of physical properties, but the presence of impurities can reduce the quality of the fuel (Basar et al., 2021). Studies have shown that the elemental content of bio-oil is closely related to the lignocellulosic species (Yang et al., 2020). Lignocellulose-derived bio-oil typically contains 69.0–83.9% carbon and 0.01–0.63% sulfur, which is lower than the crude oil content. The range of oxygen content in bio-oil is typically 3.1–18%. The nitrogen content of bio-oil derived from lignocellulosic biomass is usually lower than 0.6%. HHV is an important parameter to measure the quality of bio-oil, and the HHV of bio-oil is 30.8–42.2 MJ/kg, which is lower than that of crude oil. To achieve further upgrading and utilization, bio-oil is currently upgraded to liquid fuels mainly by hydrodeoxygenation, catalytic cracking, and fractional distillation (Ahamed et al., 2021; Beims et al., 2020). To improve fuel quality, the upgrading process needs to maximize the carbon and hydrogen content and reduce the nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur contents in bio-oil. Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of bio-oil is considered as an efficient modification method, and this process effectively improves the hydrocarbon yield and improves bio-oil quality (Jensen et al., 2016). In addition, catalysts play a vital role in the hydroprocessing of bio-oil, which requires an effective reduction of oxygenated compounds with low hydrogen consumption and low coking (Sharma et al., 2021). Among them, the advantages of multiphase catalysts in terms of hydrogenation efficiency and recoverability have promising applications for upgrading of crude oil. Distillation is considered as an effective method to improve the calorific value, viscosity, elemental content, and stability of bio-oil. Fractional distillation, as a physical process, is more economical to be used for upgrading of bio-oil (Taghipour et al., 2019). In addition, bio-oil can be catalyzed to produce various bio-products such as polyols, epoxy resins, and polyurethane (PU) foam materials (Jindal & Jha, 2016b)."
15,Aqueous phase products,"4.2 Aqueous phase products The aqueous phase products of lignocellulosic biomass contain various compounds such as organic acids (e.g., glycolic, acetic, propionic, and butyric acids), inorganic metals (e.g., sodium, silicon, and sulfur), alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol), ketones (e.g., acetone, cyclopentanone, etc.), and furfural (Cao et al., 2017). The aqueous phase products need to be treated before discharge to avoid environmental pollution. Currently, the aqueous phase products are treated in various ways such as circulation, anaerobic digestion, microalgae culture, catalytic gasification, and electrochemical techniques. Aqueous phase products can be used as a growth medium for microalgae to provide them with nutrients. It was demonstrated that the culture of viz. Chlamydomonas globosa, Chlorella minutissima and Scenedesmus bijuga in a mixed nutrient solution of organic carbon substrate and aqueous phase effectively increased the algal biomass production (3–10 times higher) (Bhatnagar et al., 2011). However, substances that inhibit algal growth (e.g. phenols and metals) are also present in the aqueous phase and need to be diluted for use (Biller et al., 2012). Das et al. (2020) found that proper dilution of the hydrothermally liquefied aqueous phase liquid could replace 50% of the nutrients to maintain the normal growth of Tetraselmis sp. metabolically. Catalytic gasification as another utilization of the aqueous phase can be effectively used in producing gaseous fuel products for fuel. Catalytic gasification using Ru/C catalyst can convert organic compounds in the aqueous phase to a gas consisting of CH4 and CO2 and achieve purification of the aqueous phase (Elliott et al., 2017). It was demonstrated that the aqueous phase was almost completely gasified by catalytic hydrothermal gasification, where the organic compounds were produced with maximum hydrogen production (for bio-oil hydrodeoxygenation) (Cherad et al., 2016). In addition, anaerobic digestion can convert organic compounds from the aqueous phase into biogas. Different HTL conditions produce various biodegradable organic compounds, with less production at high temperatures, which is not conducive to the reaction (Chen et al., 2017). The aqueous phase products also serve as substrates for microbial electrolysis cells, for example, the aqueous phase products of corn stalk were treated by electrochemical techniques, which produced hydrogen at a maximum rate of 25.49 mL/(L • d) and hydrogen content of up to 55.45% (Shen et al., 2016). For large-scale operations, the recycling of the aqueous phase can reduce the use of water and reduce the cost of wastewater treatment. The recycling of the aqueous phase products of barley straw as a solvent for HTL leads to a slight increase in bio-oil yield and calorific value, providing opportunities for sustainable use of the aqueous phase (Zhu et al., 2015). The utilization of the aqueous phase is important for the economics and sustainability of overall HTL process and needs to be further explored."
16,Solid residue,"4.3 Solid residue Solid residue (bio-char) is another important by-product of the HTL of lignocellulosic biomass. The major component of bio-char is carbon, followed by H and O, with N and S as trace elements. Compared to other bio-chars, bio-char produced by HTL has more oxygen-containing functional groups, such as carboxyl groups, hydroxyl groups, carbonyl groups, and phenols (Ponnusamy et al., 2020). According to many studies, bio-char can be used as a fuel. The calorific value of bio-char gradually decreases with increasing temperature, and high temperature conditions causes the energy of bio-char to decrease, so biochar obtained at low temperatures is more favorable for energy applications (Reddy et al., 2016). Compared to pyrolytic bio-char, hydrothermal liquefied bio-char has a smaller specific surface area, but hydrothermal liquefied bio-char has a higher capacity for adsorption of metals, dyes, and other pollutants. It is believed that this may be due to the presence of more oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of bio-char, which helps to improve the removal of organic pollutants (Leng et al., 2015). Biochar can also be used for soil remediation, which helps to sequester carbon to improve soil fertility and reduce soil and groundwater contamination (Beims et al., 2020). In addition, hydrothermal biochar can be used as an anaerobic digestion additive to promote redox reactions in anaerobic digestion to produce methane gas (Shanmugam et al., 2018). Bio-char plays a significant role in the application of carbon materials as a by-product of the HTL process."
17,Gas phase products,"4.4 Gas phase products Gas phase products constitute the smallest proportion of HTL products (about 5–10%) and contain mainly CO2 (80–95%) with small amounts of H2, CO, and CH4 (Basar et al., 2021). The gas phase products of the HTL process are mainly produced through decarbonylation and decarboxylation reactions. The low content of CO may be due to the predominance of decarboxylation reactions. Also, CO is readily produced by water–gas shift to H2 and CO2 (Li et al., 2020). Currently, there are fewer studies on the application of gas phase products, which are mainly used as gas fertilizer in greenhouse, algae growth, and fuel gas."
18,Techno-economic and environmental analysis,"This review provides a reference for hydrothermal liquefaction of lignocellulose by summarizing various operating parameters to optimize process performance and product recovery. In general, lignocellulose is pretreated before hydrothermal liquefaction to reduce particle size and to remove contaminants. It has been reported that alkaline pretreatment generated a stable substrate that can be easily pumped (Gollakota et al., 2018). The hydrothermal liquefaction process needs to be heated to the required temperature, and energy consumption can be reduced by improving the effective insulation of the reactor. In addition, the addition of catalysts can also effectively reduce the temperature of the reaction process and reduce the input energy cost. The hydrothermal liquefaction process mainly converts biomass into bio-oil, and the obtained bio-oil does not require much upgrading for commercial application. In terms of techno-economic analysis, bio-oil upgrading costs are higher (Basar et al., 2021). The hydrothermal liquefaction process should not only focus on the main energy product (e.g., bio-oil), but can also consider the recycling of by-products. Among these by-products, the aqueous phase products can significantly affect the cost of producing bio-oil. Hydrothermal liquefaction using low-moisture lignocellulose can reduce treatment costs by recycling the aqueous phase to reduce the use of water. As far as environmental friendliness is concerned, the reduction in the amount of wastewater contributes to environmental protection. Since the biochar yield is low during the hydrothermal process, it has no major impact on the overall hydrothermal liquefaction cost. Innovative and economic applications of biochar in soil improvement, pollutant adsorption, and biocatalysis are being developed. Since the main component of hydrothermal liquefaction gas is CO2, it can be released into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases, including CO2, produced by hydrothermal liquefaction can also be captured, considering the environmental aspects. However, additional operating costs are added."
19,Perspectives and prospects,"HTL is a promising technology for preparing energy and chemicals from abundant lignocellulosic resources to achieve efficient and comprehensive utilization of their components. However, HTL of lignocellulose is mainly conducted at the laboratory stage and the following problems should be coped with: (1) HTL process involves a variety of parameters (lignocellulose species, temperature, pressure, time, heating rate, solid–to-liquid ratio, and catalyst, etc.), and the process is complicated for achieving specific liquefaction products so as to achieve efficient liquefaction of lignocellulose. (2) HTL of lignocellulose needs to be performed at high temperature and pressure, and the generation of corrosive products results in strict requirements for the equipment. (3) The reaction mechanism is still unclear. Although many studies have been conducted on the reaction mechanism of its main components, some of them were carried out using model substances, thus a clear reaction mechanism has not been elucidated, which is not conducive to the control of the process. (4) The presence of solids (such as solid residues, coke, and tar) in the product can affect the flow of the products in reactor and cause clogging of the equipment, which in turn affects the operation of the equipment. (5) The composition of the liquefied product is complex and of low quality. For example, the multiple complex mixtures in bio-oil result in poor performance and the products that cannot compete with existing fossil fuels. (6) Aqueous phase products contain a large amount of toxic and harmful substances, which cannot be discharged directly and need to be treated by reasonable methods. Based on the above analysis, future research can focus on the following aspects: (1) HTL of common lignocellulosic biomass can be studied to obtain detailed reaction parameters (temperature, pressure, and pH) in order to design suitable reactors. For example, hemicellulose can be degraded at a lower temperature, while the degradation temperatures for lignin liquefaction are higher. To achieve efficient liquefaction, two-stage or multi-stage hydrolysis can be developed, and the bio-oil in each stage can be recovered separately by a flow-through reactor. (2) The development of green and efficient catalysts can degrade the main components of lignocellulose at lower temperatures and improve bio-oil yield and quality. (3) Rational optimization of reaction parameters to improve the yield and quality of target products and maximal use lignocellulosic liquefaction products by upgrading them to value-added products. For example, developing bio-oil upgrading process and biochar materials and recycling the aqueous phase products can avoid environmental pollution. (4) To avoid equipment clogging due to the low solubility of solid products, appropriate conditions should be selected as well as effective separation techniques, such as the use of solvents or physical techniques (filtration and centrifugation) to separate the products. (5) Deep revealing the mechanism of liquefaction reaction can establish a process optimization model to achieve scientific prediction of the composition of liquefaction products."
20,Conclusion,"The fundamental research of HTL attracts increased attention and many works have been conducted on the process and related products. The review focuses on the reaction mechanism, influence factor, and product application of HTL. Although mechanisms of the structural components have been investigated, more attention on the complex process should be paid to the correlations between them. The optimization of the parameters is vital for the developments of end products—bio-oil, liquid product, bio-char, and gas products. The development of corresponding equipment and the design of environmentally friendly process are key determinants for HTL process in future."
