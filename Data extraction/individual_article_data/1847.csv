0,Introduction,"Natural gas hydrate has become one of the research hotspots in energy industry and attracted considerable research effort in exploitation, storage and transport a lot of attention. In addition to the high energy density, wide global distribution and high resource value, natural gas hydrates produce nearly no residue and pollution after combustion [1–3]. Four major methods are commonly used to exploit natural gas hydrates: decompression [4,5], thermal stimulation [6,7], gas replacement [8–10] and chemical injection [11–13]. Compared with the first three methods, chemical injection has lower energy demand and higher natural gas production rate. The injection of chemical agents is to change the phase equilibrium condition of methane hydrate by injecting chemical agents, so that methane hydrate needs higher pressure or lower temperature to keep stable [11–13]. Investigations on the methane hydrate decomposition via chemical injection mainly focus on the effect of chemicals on the hydrate evolution, using both experimental and simulation techniques. Experiments are complex, dangerous and costly, and the results acquired are easily influenced by human factors and uncontrollable environmental factors. By contrast, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has the advantages of safety, low cost and not easy to be affected by the environment. In addition, it can obtain the detailed information of complex system structure, dynamics and thermal dynamics on the micro scale. But the biggest disadvantage of MD simulation is that it will be limited by the computing power of computer [14,15]. In recent years, MD simulation have been used as a reliable tool to study the role of additives in the formation [16–,17] and decomposition [18–23] of gas hydrates. Storr et al. [18] and Anderson et al. [19] researched the inhibitory mechanism of KHI for formation of hydrates through MD simulations. The effect of various functional groups and hydrogen bond interactions on hydrophobic interaction was revealed in details. Wan et al. [20] studied the decomposition of methane hydrates in the presence of ethylene glycol (11.45 mol·L−1) at 277.0 K using canonical ensemble (NVT) MD simulations and found that hydrate decomposition started from the surface layer of the solid hydrate and then gradually expanded to the internal layer. The inner dissociating layer was coated by a liquid film formed from outer dissociated water molecules outside and this film inhibited the mass transfer performance during the hydrate decomposition process. Chen et al. [21] used MD simulations to study the effect of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) on the decomposition process of methane hydrates. Results showed that when the concentration of PVA was 5.2 wt%, the cage structure of hydrates was destroyed. It was further found that hydroxyl groups of PVA could form hydrogen bonds among molecules, preventing the regeneration of hydrate. Yan et al. [22] studied the decomposition process of methane hydrates by thermal stimulation method, inhibitor method and combination of both through MD simulations. They investigated the decomposition of methane hydrates in the presence of liquid water and ethylene glycol solution at 277 K and 340 K. It was found that combination of thermal stimulation method and chemical injection method could better promote the decomposition of methane hydrates. Javad Kondori et al. [23] used MD simulations to study the impact of temperature, pressure, cage occupancy and inhibitors on the decomposition process of methane hydrates. It was concluded that the decomposition process of methane hydrates consists of two steps. Firstly, the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules was destroyed. In the second step, the methane molecules escaped from the damaged water cages. At present, the researches about alcohol promoting hydrate decomposition mainly focus on the influence of common alcohols (methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol) on hydrate decomposition at different concentrations and temperatures, while there are few systematic studies about the influence mechanism of alcohol structure on hydrate decomposition. Herein, the effect of alcohols structure on methane hydrates decomposition is investigated through MD simulation. In MD simulations, the consistent valence force field (CVFF) and isobaric-isothermal ensemble (NPT) are used to study the methane hydrate stability or decomposition conditions. Different alcohols (different chain length, different hydroxyl position and different hydroxyl number) and methane hydrates make up different simulation systems. In order to compare the decomposition rates of different systems, the variation of potential energy of different systems with simulation time was analyzed. Radial distribution function (RDF) and mean square displacement (MSD) are utilized to study distribution of methane molecules and water molecules and diffusion situation of methane hydrates after methane hydrates decomposition. Our research will provide a theoretical basis for future design of alcohol-based chemical agents for promoting gas hydrate decomposition and useful guidelines for solving the development of natural gas hydrate reservoirs in the South China Sea."
1,Simulation system setup and detailed process of molecular dynamics simulations,"According to the lattice vacancies and morphologies, hydrates are generally classified into three types: sI, sII and sH type hydrates. Although the stability of sI type hydrates is the weakest among three types, sI type hydrates are the most widely in nature. sI type gas hydrate mainly contains methane gas [24–28]. Hence, sI type hydrates are applied for further study in this research. The structure of sI type methane hydrates is constructed by the method in literature [18,29]. The initial position of oxygen atoms in the lattice is obtained by X-ray single crystal diffraction and hydrogen atoms are arranged disorderly. The extensively studied simple point charge (SPC) potential energy model [23,30,31] was employed, which satisfies Bernal-Fowler rule. The bond lengths and angles of water molecules were constrained with the SHAKE algorithm [32]. The MD simulations are performed using the Forcite modules and compatible valence force field (CVFF) [33–35] by Materials Studio. CVFF can describe the decomposition behavior of gas hydrates qualitatively, and is widely used in the study of methane hydrates, carbon dioxide hydrates and so on. In MD simulations, CVFF force field is often used to describe intramolecular and intermolecular interactions. Unlike rigid molecules used in previous studies, the force field takes the expansion and bending torsion of intramolecular bonds into account. The size of sI type methane hydrate later was 2.375 n m × 2.375 n m × 4.751 n m , containing 736 water molecules and 128 methane molecules. The molecular number of alcohols in all systems is the same, containing 100 alcohol molecules. Building simulation box with hydrate layer and alcohol layer, the a and b of the simulation box were 2.375 n m for all simulations, but the c of the simulation box was not fixed for all simulations (see Fig. 1 ). The energy of the model was minimized by steepest descent method and conjugate gradient method in the first place, and then MD simulation was carried out. The purpose of this work is to solve the exploitation problem of gas hydrate reservoir in the South China Sea. The temperature and pressure of gas hydrate reservoir in South China Sea are about 277.15 K and 20 MPa. During the simulation process, Nose-Hoover method was used to control the temperature at 277.15 K (which is the general mining temperature of seabed hydrate), and the pressure was kept at 20 MPa using Berendsen method. The time step is 0.1 fs. With fixed the hydrate layer, each system was equilibrated for 100 ps under NVT ensemble. Then 2000 ps MD simulation under NPT was carried out. The simulation process and details are shown in Fig. 2 ."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Depiction and characterization of the methane hydrate decomposition promoted by alcohol,"3.1 Depiction and characterization of the methane hydrate decomposition promoted by alcohol RDF usually refers to the distribution probability of other particles around a given particle in space (how far away from a given particle). For natural gas hydrates in a stable crystalline state: the first peak of RDFs between carbon atoms represents the average distance between carbon atoms in different crystal cavities; there are two characteristic peaks in the RDFs of oxygen atoms: the first peak of RDFs between oxygen atoms represents the distance between oxygen atoms of adjacent water molecules connected by hydrogen bonds; the second peak of RDFs between oxygen atoms represents the tetrahedral hydrogen bond network sI type hydrates crystal structure; the first of the RDFs between carbon atoms and oxygen atoms represents the distance between the cage structure of methane and water molecules. Fig. 3 shows the characteristic peaks of carbon–carbon, oxygen–oxygen and carbon–oxygen RDFs of methane hydrate without inhibitor and with inhibitor after 2000 ps. Adding inhibitor, methane hydrates decompose, and water molecules and methane molecules produced by hydrates decomposition aggregate to form water phase and gas phase respectively. Therefore, the characteristic peaks of the gc-c RDFs and the gc-o RDFs decrease and the gc-c RDFs exhibit a new peak at r = 0.411 nm. In addition, the first peak of the go-o RDFs becomes large but other peaks become small. The distance between water molecules is the smallest and the movement of water molecules is the slowest at 277.15 K (4℃). In addition, hydrogen bonds can be formed between one water molecule and four other ones. Adding alcohols, methane hydrates cages are destroyed, the distance between water molecules become smaller and water molecules distributed more uniformly. Table 1 shows the comparison between the major peaks in the RDFs in our work and previous studies for hydrates decomposition system AAD% represents the average absolute deviation percentage. According to the magnitudes of AAD%, very good agreement is shown between the results of the current research investigation and previous studies from literature. MSD refers to the degree of deviation between the molecular space position and its initial position in the simulation system at a given time. Without inhibitor, methane hydrates don’t decompose at 2000 ps, hydrates are in a stable crystalline state (see Fig. 4 (a)). Water molecules are at a relatively fixed lattice site and the methane molecules are in hydrate cages. The MSD of water and methane molecules can be stabilized at a very small value (see Fig. 4(c)). When natural gas hydrates decompose (see Fig. 4(b)), the movement of water and methane molecules is unrestricted, and the MSD increases with time (see Fig. 4(c)). In this work, the damage degree of sI type natural gas hydrate cages under different conditions by comparing the gc-c (carbon–carbon), go-o (oxygen–oxygen) and gc-o (carbon–oxygen) RDFs of methane hydrate and the diffusion coefficient of methane molecules after natural gas hydrates decomposition were obtained by calculating the slope of MSD curves of carbon and oxygen atoms. Alkyl groups in alcohols are strong electron donor. The electron cloud density of the oxygen atom in alcohol molecules is higher than that in water molecules. The hydrogen bonds formed by alcohol molecules and water molecules are stronger than the hydrogen bonds between water molecules [21,23]. Upon adding alcohols into methane hydrates, the oxygen atoms of alcohol molecules can form new hydrogen bonds with the hydrogen atoms of water molecules in methane hydrates in order to promote methane hydrates decomposition. Taking methanol as an example, the process of methanol promoting hydrate decomposition was shown in Fig. 5 . Fig. 5 shows that the hydrate decomposition process after adding methanol. At first the hydrates at the solid–liquid interface decompose. Then a small amount of methanol molecules gradually diffuses and contacts with the new solid–liquid interface and the cages of hydrates are gradually destroyed from both sides to the middle with the increase of simulation time. Meanwhile, the methane molecules gradually escape from the hydrate cages and diffuse from water into alcohol to form gas phase. At 2000 ps (as shown in Fig. 6 ), the water molecules produced by hydrate decomposition form the water phase, and the methane molecules produced by hydrate decomposition form the gas phase. A small amount of methanol molecules diffuses into water phase, and the residual methanol molecules distribute between the water phase and the gas phase. That is because the dissolution of alcohol in water takes longer time than the methane hydrate decomposition. The total simulation time for each case is 2000 ps, during which the methane hydrate can completely decompose but methanol can’t completely dissolve in water."
4,Effect of the alcohol chain length on the rate of methane hydrate decomposition,"3.2 Effect of the alcohol chain length on the rate of methane hydrate decomposition Since the decomposition of methane hydrates is endothermic, the total potential energy of systems will increase upon their decomposition. After methane hydrates completely decomposed, the total potential energy of systems leveled off with simulation time. The total potential energy-time curves of systems with alcohols of different chain length are obtained as shown in Fig. 7 . The decomposition rate of methane hydrates differs with the addition of alcohols of different chain length. Adding methanol, ethanol, and 1-propanol, methane hydrates decompose completely at 1530 ps, 1650 ps and 1700 ps respectively. In contrast, methane hydrates don’t decompose completely at 2000 ps with adding 1-butanol, indicating the decomposition rate is inversely proportional to the alcohol chain length. As shown in Fig. 8 (d), the first peak value of the RDFs between oxygen atom of alcohol and oxygen atom of water decreased as the increase of the alcohol chain length. The reason is that, alcohols, which have longer chain length, have smaller polarity but larger steric hindrance in order to form weaker hydrogen bonds between alcohol molecules and water molecules and destroy fewer hydrogen bonds between water molecules simultaneously at the interface of alcohols and hydrates. In addition, the viscosity of alcohols increases as the increase of the alcohol chain length. This causes the diffusion rate of methane molecules from water into alcohols decreases as the increase of the alcohol chain length. So as the alcohol chain length increases, the peak values of the gc-c RDFs of methane hydrate at r = 0.411 nm decrease but other peak values increase (see Fig. 8(a)). Meanwhile, the gc-o RDFs of methane hydrate become smooth as the decrease of the alcohol chain length (see Fig. 8(b)). As a result of the negative correlation between the alcohol chain length and the alcohol solubility in water, there are fewer alcohol molecules in water as the increase of the chain length. As shown in Fig. 8(c), adding alcohol of longer chain length, the peak values of the go-o RDFs at r = 0.272 nm is larger and the go-o RDFs is smoother. Fig. 9 (a) shows the methane molecules MSDs of simulation systems with alcohols of different chain length from 0 ps to 2000 ps. The MSDs per 200 ps are used to calculate the diffusion coefficient in different time. Fig. 9(b) shows the change of methane molecules diffusion coefficients with simulation time in systems adding different chain length alcohols. The diffusion coefficients increase with the increase of simulation time. However, increasing chain length will reduce methane diffusion coefficients due to the augmented viscosity of alcohols. The slow diffusion of methane molecules is not conducive to the further decomposition of methane hydrates."
5,Effect of the alcohol hydroxyl position on the rate of methane hydrate decomposition,"3.3 Effect of the alcohol hydroxyl position on the rate of methane hydrate decomposition The total potential energy-time curves of systems with alcohols possessing hydroxyl group at different position are shown in Fig. 10 . The hydroxyl position is different, and the decomposition rate of methane hydrates is slightly different. Adding 1-pentanol, 2-pentanol and 3-pentanol, methane hydrates decompose completely at 1420 ps, 1300 ps and 1500 ps respectively. From Fig. 11 we can learn the velocity of destroying hydrate cage in the system with 1-pentanol is similar to that in the system with 2-pentanol, but the velocity of destroying hydrate cage in the system with 3-pentanol is smaller than that in the system with 1-pentanol or 2-pentanol. This is principally because the closer the hydroxyl group is to the middle of the carbon chain, the greater the steric hindrance is, and the more difficult it is to destroy the multiple hydrogen bonds between water molecules in hydrates at the same time. However, the chain length and hydroxyl number of 1-pentanol, 2-pentanol and 3-pentanol are same, the polarity is similar, and the solubility in water is similar. So the go-o RDFs show no difference. As shown in the Fig. 12 , the MSDs and the diffusion coefficient of methane molecules in the simulation systems with 2-pentanol is bigger than the MSDs and the diffusion coefficient of methane molecules in the simulation systems with 1-pentanol or 3-pentanol. That is because that 1-pentanol has no branch chain and is easy to entangle, methane molecules are difficult to diffuse. And the space potential resistance of 3-pentanol is large, the viscosity of 3-pentanol is large."
6,Effect of the alcohol hydroxyl number on the rate of methane hydrate decomposition,"3.4 Effect of the alcohol hydroxyl number on the rate of methane hydrate decomposition The potential energy-time curves of systems adding alcohols with different hydroxyl number are shown in Fig. 13 . The hydrogen number of alcohols have great impact on methane hydrates decomposition. As shown in Fig. 13, adding 1-propanol, 1,2-propanediol and glycerol, methane hydrates decompose completely at 1700 ps, 1500 ps and 900 ps respectively. As a result of the increase of the alcohol hydroxyl number, the number of hydrogen bonds between water molecules attacked by one alcohol molecules increase. But the number of hydroxyl groups directly affects the polarity and the viscosity of alcohols. As the increase of the hydroxyl number, the solubility of methane molecules in alcohols deteriorates and diffusion of methane molecules from water into alcohols becomes more difficult, consequently, methane molecules gather together in alcohols more easily and more methane molecules aggregate in water (see Fig. 14 ). Fig. 15 (a) shows the methane molecules MSDs of simulation systems with alcohols of different hydroxyl number from 0 ps to 2000 ps and Fig. 15(b) shows the change of methane diffusion coefficients with simulation time. The alcohol hydroxyl number varies directly as the polarity and the viscosity of alcohols. The MSDs and the diffusion coefficients of methane increase as the increase of the hydrogen number."
7,Conclusions,"In this paper, MD simulations was used to study the effect of chain length, hydroxyl position and hydroxyl number of alcohols on the decomposition process of natural gas hydrates at the molecular level. The simulation results show that when alcohols are added into methane hydrates, methane hydrate decompose. Water molecules and methane molecules produced by hydrates decomposition aggregate to form water phase and gas phase respectively, and alcohol molecules are mainly distributed between water phase and gas phase. The decomposition rate of methane hydrate is affected by chain length, hydroxyl position and hydrogen number of alcohol. The rate of methane hydrate decomposition is inversely proportional to the chain length but is directly proportional to the hydrogen number. In addition, alcohol with short branched chains is conducive to promoting the decomposition of methane hydrate. The above results can provide a theoretical basis for design of alcohol-based molecules chemical agents for promoting gas hydrate decomposition and useful guidelines for the exploitation of natural gas hydrate reservoir in South China Sea."
