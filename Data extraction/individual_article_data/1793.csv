0,Introduction,"Plasma technology has been presented as a valuable catalytic-free technique for hydrogen production since plasma provides the necessary energy for the reforming of fuels, hydrocarbons or alcohols [1–3]. Among different plasma types, non-thermal ones are found to be the most appropriate for this purpose due to their low power requirements. Part of the energy supplied to the discharge is used to produce energetic electrons, providing energy for the generation of active species involved in the chemical reactions induced during the decomposition of the hydrogen source. In addition to hydrogen, plasma technology has been shown to be useful as a mean to produce the formation of valuable sub-products like petrochemical hydrocarbons [4] or carbon-based nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes [5,6] or graphene [6–9]. In particular, the possibility of working at atmospheric pressure makes plasma technology an economic and attractive technique for the implementation of the process on an industrial scale. Thus, it is not surprising that academia and industry have devoted resources and expertise to use non-thermal plasmas for the decomposition of hydrocarbons or alcohols to produce high valuable products. In this sense, some non-thermal plasmas such as Dielectric Barrier Discharges (DBDs) have been successfully used to decompose alcohols like methanol [10,11] and ethanol [11–13] besides hydrocarbons [14,15] to obtain H2 as well as light hydrocarbons. Additionally, in [2] natural gas was decomposed in a pulsed corona discharge and H2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4 and C2H6 by-products were obtained. Lindner et al. [16] reported the reforming of methanol into H2, CO and H2O within a DC microplasma reactor using N2 as the carrier gas, whereas Aubry et al. [3] introduced a mixture of ethanol and water between two electrodes producing CO2 in addition to H2. Notwithstanding the advantages of DBDs or corona discharge systems, microwave induced plasmas (MIPs) are presented as noteworthy electrodeless plasmas which can operate in a wide range of experimental conditions. Jasinski et al. [17–19] used a waveguide-based nozzleless cylinder-type microwave plasma source (MPS) at atmospheric pressure as a system to convert methane [17–19] and tetrafluoroethane [19] into hydrogen using both large amounts of hydrocarbon flows and high values of powers. In this case, a 100% of hydrogen selectivity was reported and carbon soot was formed on the reactor walls. Surface-Wave Discharges (SWDs), a special type of MIP, have also been researched for hydrogen production. Yanguas-Gil et al. [20] observed a complete decomposition of ethanol into H2, CO and CO2 as well as C2 and higher hydrocarbons as trace levels in a SWD at reduced pressure. While a carbon deposition was noticed in the process, the addition of water avoided the soot formation. Wang et al. [21] detected the formation of radicals from alcohols (methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol) decomposition giving rise to H2, H2O, CO and a mixture of hydrocarbons (mainly C2H2) also in a SWD at reduced pressure. Furthermore, Jiménez et al. [22] studied the decomposition of the aforementioned alcohols in an atmospheric-pressure SWD. Two different configurations were assessed: flame and column [23]. It was found that the flame configuration was the most appropriate to withstand the introduction of alcohols. For this configuration, the excitation processes inside the plasma were favoured by the high values of electron density and gas temperature [24,25]. In addition, in [26], hydrogen production (2.5mole per mole of ethanol) together with CO and C2H2 as main gases using a SWD was reported. The same plasma source was successfully applied for the synthesis of multiwall carbon nanotubes and graphene [6] by the decomposition of ethanol. Among other microwave sources, plasma torches are of special interest due to their capability of withstanding the introduction of substances and favouring excitation and dissociation processes of molecules. A continuous microwave power system has been used to produce a high conversion of methane [27,28] as well as methanol [29]. High H2 and low C2H2, C2H4 and HCN selectivities were achieved using low power, together with the production of carbon nanoparticles, without the emission of CO2 [27,28] from methane decomposition, contrary to what happened in the decomposition of methanol [29]. A surface wave driven torch operated in laminar [30] and vortex flows [31–34] was used to study the decomposition of ethanol [30,31,33,34], methanol [30–32] and propanol [31]. In [30], nearly a 100% decomposition of the hydrogen source was obtained, resulting in a high selectivity of H2 and the formation of both CO and black carbon as by-products. Additionally, when water vapour was intentionally added to the alcohol, carbon soot formation was avoided while CO2 was formed. Furthermore, in [31–34] a vortex flow configuration was assessed for hydrogen production. Although the same by-products were formed at the plasma exit, hydrogen production was increased. The experimental results agreed well with theoretical predictions for H2 and CO production by means of the decomposition of ethanol [32], ethanol and water [34] and methanol [32]. In addition to the aforesaid plasma sources, TIAGO torch (Torche à Injection Axiale sur guide D’Ondes) has also been studied for this purpose [35]. Ethanol was almost completely decomposed (conversion rates higher than 99.6%) producing hydrogen with a high selectivity (up to 85%). In addition, it was shown that this plasma source withstands ethanol concentrations up to 7.5%. Besides, a high influence of the air ambience surrounding the discharge on the type of sub-products was found. As it can be extracted from the results found with different plasma sources, alcohols or hydrocarbons can be effectively decomposed to produce hydrogen but, in addition, dissimilarities in the production of other gaseous products were also reported. According to the bibliography, the hydrogen-source can be decomposed to obtain H2 and also, on the one hand, H2O and CO2 or, on the other hand, CO and light hydrocarbons. Therefore, studying and understanding the different decomposition routes as function of plasma operating conditions is crucial to enhance the production of hydrogen through a green process which avoids the formation of undesirable gases. It is well-known that plasma processes (kinetics) can be modified by acting on the operating conditions. Hence, in the current work, the relationship between species produced from ethanol decomposition in the plasma generated by a TIAGO device and by-products formation at the plasma exit has been researched as function of operating conditions such as plasma gas flow and hydrogen-source amounts. With this study, we contribute to infer the dependence of plasma-ethanol decomposition process on the formation of products at the plasma exit, which results in a complete understanding of different chemical routes for ethanol decomposition. Non-intrusive emission spectroscopy techniques for the analysis of the plasma (excited species and gas temperature) together with mass spectrometry technique for the identification of gaseous products were successfully applied for understanding by-products formation."
1,Materials and methods,"The experimental setup (see Fig. 1 ) was the same described in [35]. The plasma was created by using a TIAGO device [36] which has been theoretically and experimentally described in [36–38]. The discharge was generated at the end of the tip of a cylindrical hollow metallic rod. The plasma is a jet consisting of a mixing layer around a conical core. In the mixing layers, the plasma gas and the air surrounding the discharge interact. This interaction highly affects the discharge kinetics and equilibrium properties in Ar plasmas [37,38] but also the decomposition routes of ethanol [35]. In the current research, high-purity Ar (99.999%) gas was used to initiate and feed the discharge with flows ranging from 0.15 to 1.50L/min controlled by a HI-TEC controller (HI-TEC, Bronkhorst). After ignition, ethanol (EtOH) was added to the discharge in gas phase after being evaporated by means of a gas-phase liquid delivery system (CEM, Bronkhorst) with quantities ranging from 0.22 to 1.00g/h. A constant input power (300W) was supplied in a continuous mode by a 2.45GHz SAIREM microwave generator (GMP KG/D) equipped with a water cooled circulator to avoid power reflection damage. As it has been previously indicated, the goal of this research is to find and understand plasma processes which promote the formation of gaseous and solid products at the plasma exit through different ethanol decomposition routes. For that reason, Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) and Mass Spectrometry (MS) have been used as analysis-techniques. On the one hand, to infer plasma kinetics and the formation of plasma species, plasma radiation was directed to the entrance slit of a 1-m focal length Jobin-Yvon-Horiba monochromator (1000M. Czerny-Turner type) equipped with a holographic diffraction grating of 2400grooves/mm. Besides, a Symphony CCD (CCD-1024x256-OPEN-STE) was used as radiation detector. On the other hand, a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS, PT M63 1121, mod. Omnistar, Pfeiffer Vacuum Technology) was utilized to analyse the composition of the gas exiting the discharge, as well as to quantify hydrogen production thanks to a previous calibration. In order to prevent solid by-products from entering into this device, a filter (re. 33127-201 Iberfluid, Spain) was placed between the reactor and the spectrometer probe."
2,Experimental results. Discussion,
3,Plasma characteristics: gas temperature,"3.1 Plasma characteristics: gas temperature In plasma processes, gas temperature is always an essential parameter. The dependence of by-products on gas temperature has been previously reported [26,32–34], thus highlighting the necessity of controlling this parameter in the process optimization for industrial applications. Gas temperature (T gas) is a measure of the energy of plasma heavy particles which participate in some plasma processes. This temperature is usually obtained by means of the rotational temperature of some molecular species existing in the discharge, such as OH [39–41], N2 + [42,43], CN [44] or C2 [45]. The identification of both gas and rotational temperatures is allowed by the highly favourable energy exchange between heavy particles and internal rotational–vibrational states of the molecular species involved [46] in plasmas sustained at atmospheric pressure. Thus, gas temperature can be derived from the ro-vibrational spectra of some molecular species from the plasma. In the current research, this parameter was determined by using the well-known Boltzmann-plot method applied to the relative intensity distribution of the rotational spectrum of N2 + [37] for pure Ar plasma and C2 [26,35] when ethanol was added to the discharge. On the one hand, the P-branch lines of the N2 + molecular band (B2Σu + →X2Σg +) (0–0) at 391.4nm used for this purpose are shown in Table 1 . The rotational temperature was deduced from the slope of Eq. (1), where parameters A and B correspond to each rotational transition [47] and I is the intensity of each line (1) log I A = - 1.296 T gas B + const On the other hand, the P-branch lines of the C2 band (A3Πg →X3Πu) (0–0) at 516.5nm were also used when this specie was excited in Ar-ethanol plasmas (Table 2 ). In this case, the rotational temperature was obtained from the slope of Eq. (2), where I is the measured line intensity, A and B parameters are the Hönl-London factor and the excitation energy of each level, respectively [48,49] (2) log I A = - 1.090 T gas B + const Gas temperature variation as a function of Ar and ethanol flow is shown in Fig. 2 . Ar flow was varied maintaining a constant ethanol flow of 0.80g/h (bottom x-axis). In the upper y-axis, the dependence of gas temperature on the ethanol flow while keeping a constant Ar flow of 0.50L/min is plotted. According to the values depicted in Fig. 2, T gas exhibits a tendency to grow with Ar and EtOH flows up to values equal to 1.00L/min and 0.60g/h, respectively. Then, a plateau is reached. The same effect with ethanol concentration was also reported in [35]. However, in Rincón et al. [35] the gas temperature showed a drop with the increase of Ar flow, which is in agreement with what was found by Jimenéz et al. [26] in a SWD for the same amount of ethanol (0.22g/h). This difference can be explained on the basis of the effect of the alcohol dilution in the plasma gas. For low amounts of alcohol such as 0.22g/h [26,38], an increase of Ar gas flow entails a high dilution degree of it. In those cases, ethanol does not have the same influence on plasma kinetics. Therefore, the discharge tends to behave as a pure Ar plasma with a decreased value of gas temperature. Nevertheless, under the conditions studied in the present research, when the amount of ethanol is higher (0.80g/h), the increase of Ar flow does not lead to a significant dilution of ethanol. This fact joined to a lesser presence of nitrogen in the plasma gives place to an increase in gas temperature up to a specific value, from which the gas temperature tends to remain constant."
4,Ethanol decomposition in Ar discharges: spectroscopic study,"3.2 Ethanol decomposition in Ar discharges: spectroscopic study 3.2.1 Excited species formation: plasma kinetics The study of the radiation emitted by the plasma has been found to be an important tool to understand ethanol decomposition in this medium [26,27,50]. In this sense, the emission of excited species from Ar and Ar/EtOH discharges was studied by OES to shed some light on the decomposition process. In Fig. 3 , emission spectra of Ar (a) and Ar/EtOH (b, c and d) discharges are presented. Fig. 3b and c show spectra emitted by discharges generated with Ar flow equals to 0.50L/min and EtOH flows of 0.22 and 0.80g/h, respectively. In Fig. 3d the spectrum emitted by a discharge sustained with 0.75L/min of Ar and 0.22g/h of EtOH, respectively, is presented. Molecular and atomic emissions found in the recorded spectra are summarized in Tables 3 and 4 . According to Fig. 3a the emission spectrum of a pure Ar plasma is dominated by the emission of Ar excited levels; emission bands of nitrogen-containing species like molecular ions (N2 +), CN (Violet system) or NO (γ system) can also be observed [37]. It reveals that the contact of the surrounding air with the flame gives place to the entrance of atmospheric gases such as nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide, which leads to the formation of those molecular species and their observation. With ethanol introduction, changes in the plasma-emitted radiation can be observed (Fig. 3b–d). As for spectral Ar lines, 5p levels (400–500nm) disappear whereas the population of 4p levels (>600nm) drops drastically. Simultaneously, CI (atomic carbon), CN (Violet system), C2 (Swan and D’eslambres-D’azambuja systems) and CH (3142Å system) are detected. These results suggest that ethanol molecules are effectively decomposed by the TIAGO plasma and a part of the energy supplied to the plasma is used to dissociate ethanol molecules. This fact provokes the disruption of the normal Ar atoms stepwise excitation and, consequently, variations in the Ar atomic lines [38]. Regarding the emission of molecular species coming from ethanol decomposition, CN (Violet system) species is always formed (Fig. 3b–d). However, C2 and CH species are only observed when the introduced ethanol is large enough in relation to Ar flow (Fig. 3c). Both CN and C2 species can be formed by three body recombination reactions (Eqs. (3) and (4), respectively). These reactions involve carbon and nitrogen atoms coming from the ethanol decomposition and the air surrounding the discharge. As it was reported in [37], the entrance of surrounding air in the plasma flame favours the formation of CN radicals instead of C2 species. (3) C+N+Ar → CN ∗ + Ar (4) C+C+Ar → C 2 ∗ + Ar Nitrogen atoms, which play an important role in TIAGO plasma kinetics [37,38], are likely produced via dissociative recombination reactions (Eq. (5)) [51,52,58] of nitrogen ions. These nitrogen ions would be previously obtained by reactions between argon molecular ions and nitrogen molecules by a charge transfer (Eq. (6)), due to the comparable ionization energies of Ar (15.9eV) and N2 (15.6eV) (5) N 2 + + e - → N + N (6) Ar + + N 2 → Ar + N 2 + Additionally, an erosion of the nozzle tip was noticed which is related to the emission of Fe I line as it can be observed in Fig. 3. As far as the emission of Balmer-series lines is concerned, H β line has not been detected in Ar–EtOH discharges as it happened in Ar plasma torches [37]. H α line experiments an increase in intensity when a small amount of EtOH is introduced (Fig. 3a and d). However, a further increase of the ethanol ratio in the carrier gas is not translated into an increase of H α line intensity. The hydrogen Fulcher band emitted in the 560–640nm interval, corresponding to H2 at the excited level, was not observed under our experimental conditions. These results point out that the formation of species into the plasma from ethanol decomposition depends on argon and ethanol flows in the feed mixture. 3.2.2 Influence of Ar gas and ethanol flows on ethanol decomposition process The effect of both Ar and EtOH flows on ethanol decomposition process and, consequently, on species formed into the plasma has been studied. For this purpose, two molecular bandheads, C2 (516.2nm) and CN (388.3nm), as well as an atomic carbon line (247.9nm) intensities were monitored for different values of Ar and EtOH flows (Figs. 4 and 5 ). Fig. 4 shows the dependence of C2 and CN bandheads and CI line intensities with the Ar flow, considering 0.80g/h of ethanol. For comparison, line intensities have been related to ethanol dilution. As it can be observed, these bandhead intensities grow for Ar flows increasing up to 0.50L/min. For higher flows, the intensities of C2 and CI continue increasing but CN band intensity tends to decrease. This fact can be explained on the basis of Ar flow influence on discharge kinetics reported in [37]. That is, when Ar flow is increased, the interaction between the plasma dart and the surrounding air is reduced to the outermost layers of the dart, thus lowering the overall influence of nitrogen. The dependence of CI line and CN and C2 bandhead intensities on EtOH flow is shown in Fig. 5. The discharge was created keeping a constant Ar flow (0.50L/min). When the EtOH was introduced into the plasma (0.22g/h), atomic carbon formation was readily produced as it is shown by the emission of CI line. However, this intensity does not experiment a significant change with the increase of ethanol in the Ar/EtOH mixture. In contrast, CN bandhead shows a continuous growth, whereas C2 bandhead intensity experiments a significant increase for ethanol flows larger than 0.40g/h (Fig. 5). For small amounts of ethanol, Eq. (3) prevails over Eq. (4) for C2 formation. This behaviour is related to the fact that, in the presence of nitrogen, CN is favoured over C2 formation [53]. In this sense, higher amounts of ethanol (>0.40g/h) feed the plasma with carbon atoms which are used to produce CN and C2 species according to Eqs. (3) and (4), respectively. This formation explains the flat behaviour of CI line with ethanol introduction. From a direct comparison between gas temperature values and species formation with the increase of both argon and ethanol flows (Figs. 2, 4 and 5), it can be suggested that high gas temperature favours the formation of C2 via Eq. (4) in relation to the formation of CN by Eq. (3). Furthermore, it is important to highlight that solid carbon formation in both the filter and the reactor walls is noticed when either the Ar or ethanol flows are higher than 0.50L/min or 0.40g/h, respectively. Under these conditions, the discharge maintains a high gas temperature value. This strongly suggests that soot formation is not only related to the existence of atomic carbon but also to the formation of C2 species in the plasmas and high gas temperature values, as it was reported elsewhere [50]. In this sense, gas temperature, plasma kinetics and species produced in the plasma, firmly depend on the relative proportion of air and ethanol in the discharge. When the air is more important, nitrogen-containing species are produced and gas temperature is lower than in those cases where the amount of nitrogen is restricted. In the opposite case (lesser importance of air) ethanol molecules get more influence on plasma kinetics leading to the formation of C2 species and increasing gas temperature. This dependence of species formation is also translated into different by-products formed at the plasma exit which is deeply studied in the following section."
5,By-products at the plasma exit: decomposition routes,"3.3 By-products at the plasma exit: decomposition routes Mass spectrometry has been applied to identify the gaseous by-products obtained at the plasma exit. Mass spectra were recorded for m/z values from 1 to 50a.m.u. because it was demonstrated [35] that the use of plasmas at atmospheric pressure yields small and simple molecules because the great number of electrons colliding with the plasma heavy particles limit the size of by-products [54]. From a comparison of relative intensities of mass fragments following the procedure described in [26,35,50] different gaseous products could be identified. In this way, variations on their relative intensity values give information about changes regarding variations on by-products. The signal of m/z 31 a.m.u., which is ascribed to the base peak of ethanol [55], was hardly observed in the plasma gas exhaust regardless of the Ar or ethanol flows, thus highlighting a high ethanol decomposition (ca. 100%) in all cases [35]. Similarly to the formation of different plasma species, by-products detected at the plasma exit were found to be different depending on the Ar and EtOH flows. 3.3.1 Influence of Ar flow To infer the influence of Ar flow on by-products formation from the ethanol decomposition, mass spectra recorded from pure Ar and Ar–EtOH plasmas generated by using 0.25 and 0.50L/min of Ar with 0.80g/h of ethanol are depicted in Fig. 6 . For the case of 0.25L/min (Fig. 6a), the main gaseous products at the plasma exit were H2, H2O, CO and CO2. Besides, no solid carbon was formed under this experimental condition. However, when the Ar gas flow is increased (Fig. 6b) only H2 and CO were formed, together with solid carbon. Furthermore, C2H2 and HCN traces were obtained. As it has been discussed in the previous section, the air surrounding the discharge plays an important role in plasma kinetics and thus in the gases formed at the plasma exit. In order to understand the influence of air on by-products formation, the mass spectra of gases coming from a pure Ar plasma generated with 0.25 and 0.50L/min are compared in Fig. 7 . Species coming from air like N2 and O2 are more important (higher concentration) in plasmas sustained with Ar flows lower than 0.50L/min, which supports the discussion carried out in [38]. In this sense, in Ar/EtOH plasmas sustained with low Ar flows (<0.50L/min), the influence of the relative amount of O2 in the background gas mixture is enough to induce reactions to produce CO2 and CO from ethanol oxidation, in agreement with what was reported elsewhere [1,30,31,34,56] concerning the reforming of fuels. However, for Ar flows higher than 0.50 L/min, the formation of CO is favoured to CO2, because the amount of available O2 decreases. 3.3.2 Influence of ethanol flow Focusing on the influence of ethanol amount on the obtained by-products, the signal of m/z corresponding to H2, CO, CO2, C2H2, HCN and H2O were monitored and presented in Fig. 8 . Similarly to the foregoing discussion, two ethanol decomposition routes can be presented depending on the alcohol amount. When the ethanol flow is lower than 0.40g/h, H2, H2O, CO and CO2 are formed. For ethanol flows larger than 0.40g/h, H2 and CO experiment a significant increase, while the rest of by-products (C2H2 and HCN) keep their concentration at trace levels. Furthermore, the formation of solid carbon was noticed when EtOH flow was higher than this value. Under these conditions, the formation of atomic carbon and C2 radical into the plasma leads to the formation of CO and solid carbon as by-products. The presence of air components (N2, O2 …) in TIAGO plasmas influences by-products formation (Fig. 9 ). Accordingly, the presence of air in small Ar and EtOH flows gives place to the first ethanol decomposition route, (Fig. 9, route A), with the formation of H2, H2O, CO and CO2 as main gases. On the other hand, for high Ar and EtOH flows, less air reaches the discharge, thus resulting in the second ethanol decomposition route, (Fig. 9, route B), with the production of H2 and CO as main gases together with solid carbon powders. These results highlight that working with large Ar and ethanol flows, the decomposition of ethanol produces hydrogen in a cleaner and simpler process than under other flow conditions."
6,Formation processes of by-products: plasma precursors and gas temperature role,"3.4 Formation processes of by-products: plasma precursors and gas temperature role As it has been discussed in the preceding sections, different excited species can be found in the plasma depending on the experimental conditions of Ar and EtOH flows, as well as unalike by-products can be obtained at the plasma exit. Actually, an intrinsic relationship can be established between plasma species and by-products formed through ethanol decomposition. In particular, C2, CH and CN radicals in the plasma are considered plasma precursors species for acetylene (C2H2) and HCN formation, respectively. However, it is necessary to take into account an additional factor, which is the influence of the gas temperature in the formation of by-products from ethanol decomposition. 3.4.1 Acetylene (C2H2) and solid carbon formation Molecular carbon-species in the plasma, such as C2 or CH, give place to the formation of acetylene at the plasma exit. This product may be produced by means of two main routes: (i) C2 species could be hydrogenated leading to C2H2 (Eq. (7)) or (ii) C2H2 compound could be easily formed by coupling of CH radicals (Eq. (8)) (7) C 2 + 2 H → C 2 H 2 (8) CH + CH → C 2 H 2 Fig. 10 compares the intensity of C2 bandhead and m/z 26 (ascribed to acetylene) for increasing Ar (Fig. 10a) and ethanol (Fig. 10b) flows, while keeping constant EtOH (0.80g/h) and Ar (0.50L/min) flows, respectively. In this graph, C2 bandhead intensity is related to ethanol dilution whereas m/z 26 intensity (acetylene) has been normalized to its maximum value. As it can be seen, both signals follow a similar trend which seems to suggest acetylene formation through (Eq. (7)). However, the low intensity of both H and CH bands in emission spectra (Fig. 3) do not cast further light on the mechanism and, in any case, a similar trend could be expected for CH and m/z 26 since more ethanol means more carbon source. Therefore, formation of acetylene through mechanism in (Eq. (8)) cannot be completely ruled out. In Fig. 2, discharges generated with either a small Ar or EtOH flow exhibit lower gas temperatures than those sustained with larger ethanol amounts. This change in gas temperature also explains the formation of different by-products. As far as acetylene is concerned, it is only produced in plasmas with high gas temperatures (>4500K) (Fig. 10). In fact, Guéret et al. [57] found that temperatures below 1500K favour the production of ethylene from methane pyrolysis without the formation of acetylene which is in agreement with [58]. Besides, Kovacic and Ikonomov [59] studied the formation of C2H2 and C2H4 in the reforming of ethanol in an arc discharge and, from their results, high temperatures (>3000K) are needed to favour acetylene to ethylene formation. According to Fig. 2, gas temperatures for experiments in which acetylene is formed (Fig. 9) are within the 4000–6000K range, which explains the formation of acetylene, especially at high Ar and EtOH flows. In addition, it is important to remark that solid carbon by-product was simultaneously obtained with acetylene [31,50] which suggests that the formation of both by-products requires high gas temperatures. On the other hand, as it was reported elsewhere [20,30], the presence of an oxidizing component (oxygen or water) in the plasma avoids the production of carbon soot. In fact, in the current research, when oxygen from the air surrounding TIAGO plasmas is important enough (low Ar or EtOH flows) no solid carbon is produced since the oxygen drastically changes ethanol reforming pathways. 3.4.2 Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) formation As for the formation of toxic hydrogen cyanide, the presence of intense CN emissions in the discharge spectra suggests that it may be formed via CN reacting with H [60]. This can be suggested from the relationship between emission of CN and m/z 27 ascribed to HCN (intensity normalized to the maximum value) shown in Fig. 11 . However, as it was pointed out in [61], HCN is likely produced in a reaction between nitrogen radicals and acetylene (Eq. (9)). Thus, this pathway cannot be discarded (9) N + C 2 H 2 → HCN + CH 3.4.3 Hydrogen (H2) production Concerning the production of hydrogen as the main gaseous product, TIAGO torch plasma source has been demonstrated to have high efficiency for the decomposition of ethanol to produce H2 with a selectivity of 85% [35]. In Fig. 12 , the production of hydrogen in g/h is represented in the left-y-axis versus the concentration of ethanol in the mixture. This concentration can be changed by increasing/decreasing either Ar gas (solvent) or EtOH flow (solute) which modifies the decomposition route. The graph shows in green the conditions under which H2 and CO are produced; whereas in pink, those experimental conditions where H2, CO2, H2O and CO are generated. Besides, in the right-y-axis, the gas temperature is plotted versus the ethanol concentration. As it can be observed, H2 production is not related neither to the concentration of the ethanol nor the gas temperature. However, during decomposition processes where high gas temperatures are reached (>4500K) hydrogen is produced in addition to CO through a clean and simple process. According to the foregoing discussion, the relative proportion of air and ethanol in the discharge affects plasma species and by-products formation which also explains the green route for ethanol decomposition for hydrogen production. In order to have an in-depth knowledge regarding hydrogen production, the selectivity and the energetic mass yield (H2(g)/kWh) are presented in Table 5 . Both parameters have been calculated as it is indicated in [35] and their values do not depend on ethanol concentrations. In those cases in which hydrogen is obtained by a clean process, the selectivity and the energy yield achieved are encouraging [35]. Nevertheless, the optimization of the production of hydrogen must be carried out in further researches by enlarging the experimental conditions considered in the current work once the appropriate conditions for producing hydrogen by this clean process have been found."
7,Conclusions,"In the present work, the study of ethanol decomposition routes by argon plasmas sustained by a microwave TIAGO torch has been presented. Optical Emission Spectroscopy has been utilized to understand plasma chemistry and plasma kinetics, whereas Mass Spectrometry was used to identify the gaseous exhaust products from ethanol decomposition. Furthermore, a correlation between plasma species and gaseous products has been presented, thus shedding light on the decomposition routes and by-products formation. The presence of air components (N2 or O2) in TIAGO plasma influences the formation of plasmas species. CN species are formed due to the interaction of nitrogen with carbon atoms produced during the decomposition process. When the air entrance is reduced (either by increasing argon or ethanol flows), nitrogen availability is limited, thus also leading to the formation of C2 species and the increase of plasma gas temperature, which changes ethanol decomposition route. According to the analysis of the exhaust gases, two ethanol-chemistry decomposition routes can be described. On the one hand, with gas temperatures higher than 4500K, ethanol is decomposed producing syngas (H2 and CO) and carbon nanopowder as main by-products. On the other hand, lower plasmas temperatures favour H2, H2O, CO and CO2 gas production. In addition, a direct relationship between the formation of C2 species and acetylene as well as CN species and HCN suggests that acetylene is formed by a hydrogenation of C2 species and that cyanogen is related to the formation of CN species as a consequence of nitrogen surrounding the discharge, which reacts with hydrogen atoms in the plasma. Finally, it has been demonstrated that hydrogen is produced regardless of the experimental conditions. Nevertheless, it has been also proved that plasmas sustained with high gas temperatures are efficient enough to produce hydrogen through a clean and simple process."
