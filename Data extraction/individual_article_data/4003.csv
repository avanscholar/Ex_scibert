0,Introduction,"Many microorganisms form biofilms. Biofilm is thought to be clinically important because it is involved in more than 80% of microbial infections [1]. Biofilm is composed of single- or mixed-species microorganisms [2–4] in an extracellular matrix (ECM). Polysaccharides are major components of the ECM, which contains other biomolecules such as extracellular DNA [5]. The ECM acts as a barrier to immune responses by a host [6,7] and to antibiotic penetration [8–10], and thus microorganisms embedded in the biofilm are able to develop persistent infections. Aspergillus fumigatus is a filamentous and opportunistic pathogenic fungus that causes fatal invasive aspergillosis among immunocompromised patients [11–13]. Biofilm formation of A. fumigatus has been reported both in vitro [14] and in vivo [15,16]. The fungus in the biofilm exhibits decreased levels of antifungal drug susceptibility [17,18]. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a gram-positive bacterium and a common human pathogen that causes pneumonia, otitis media, meningitis, and sepsis in children and the elderly. Pneumolysin which is a pore-forming toxin produced by S. pneumoniae [19] plays a major role in the pathogenesis of pneumococcal pneumonia and meningitis [20–23]. Pneumococcal biofilms actually have been detected in patients [24,25] and have shown a much greater level of resistance to antibiotics than their planktonic counterparts [26,27]. The respiratory tract is a primary site for infection, and respiratory infections are clinically important problems. A. fumigatus and S. pneumoniae have been simultaneously detected in the tracheobronchial aspirate fluids, or sputa, of patients with cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [28,29]. In addition, A. fumigatus has been isolated as a copathogen in the lower respiratory tracts of patients with invasive pneumococcal infections [30,31]. However, very little is known about whether the fungus and pneumococci form a mixed-species biofilm. In this study, we prepared single- and mixed-species biofilms of these pathogens, and we examined them by confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy to investigate the effects of factors produced by pneumococci in mixed-species biofilm formation."
1,Materials and methods,
2,"Microorganisms, culture conditions, and reagents","2.1 Microorganisms, culture conditions, and reagents Clinical isolates A. fumigatus IFM 59056 [32], which was provided through the National BioResource Project of Japan (https://nbrp.jp/), and S. pneumoniae P02-303 (serotype 19F) [33] were used in this study, unless otherwise stated. Conidia were grown on Sabouraud dextrose agar slants (BD, Sparks, MD, USA) at 25 °C for 5–7 days. Conidia were collected by gently scraping the agar surface using sterile cotton swabs with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% Tween-20. The conidial suspension was vortexed for 1 min and passed through a sterile glass filter type 3G2 (AGC Techno Glass Co., Chiba, Japan). The conidia were pelleted, resuspended in PBS, and their colony formations were counted on potato dextrose agar plates containing 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol (Eiken Chemical Co., Tokyo, Japan). Biofilm formation experiments were performed using 24-well plates, each well of which contained 1.5 ml of Mueller-Hinton broth supplemented with 3% lysed horse blood (Kyokuto Pharmaceutical Industrial Co., Tokyo, Japan). When pneumococci were grown, 10 mM sodium thiosulfate was added to the medium. The 24-well plates were incubated in a humidified CO2 incubator at 37 °C, and the medium was changed every 24 h. For colony counting of A. fumigatus, the fungal biofilms were rinsed gently three times with PBS, recovered in 1 ml of PBS using cell scrapers and vortexed for 1 min. The suspensions were sonicated 5 times for 2 min using an ultrasonic cleaning bath (M1800-J; Branson Ultrasonics, Danbury, CT, USA), and serial dilutions (10-fold) were prepared and analyzed by plating on potato dextrose agar plates supplemented with 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Mouse monoclonal antibody against pneumolysin (1F11; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA), lactate oxidase (Toyobo Co., Osaka, Japan), and bovine liver catalase (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) were obtained commercially."
3,Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM),"2.2 Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) Conidia at a concentration of 1 × 105/ml and pneumococci at an OD595 of 0.01 were used to start single- and mixed-species biofilm formations on coverslips (C1100; Matsunami Glass Ind., Osaka, Japan). The biofilms that developed on the coverslips were washed three times with PBS, and stained with 20% (v/v) Calcofluor white stain (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 μg/ml DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature for 30 min. The biofilms were washed once with PBS and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. The coverslips were washed three times with PBS, and then rinsed with distilled water. Fluorescent images were taken and analyzed by CLSM using Fluoview FV1000 and FV10-ASW 4.2 Viewer software (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan)."
4,Scanning electron microscopy (SEM),"2.3 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) Biofilms developed on 5 × 5 mm slide glasses, which had been coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich), were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde and 4% formaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C overnight. After washing with 7.5% sucrose in PBS for 1 h, fixation was performed with 1% OsO4 in PBS at 4 °C for 1 h. Samples were treated with 2% tannic acid in PBS at 4 °C for 1 h and fixed again with 1% OsO4, as described above. After dehydration in ethanol, biofilms were freeze-dried in t-butyl alcohol. The dehydrated samples were placed in a critical point dryer, coated with gold, and observed by SEM (S-800; Hitachi High-Technologies Co., Tokyo, Japan)."
5,Construction of the pneumolysin-deletion mutant,"2.4 Construction of the pneumolysin-deletion mutant The pneumolysin-deletion mutant (Δply mutant) of the S. pneumoniae P02-303 strain was constructed, as described previously [34]. The absence of the pneumolysin gene and the presence of the upstream and downstream regions in the Δply mutant were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. The loss of pneumolysin in the mutant was further confirmed by immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody against pneumolysin."
6,Preparation of pneumococcal culture supernatants,"2.5 Preparation of pneumococcal culture supernatants The cultures of pneumococci that developed overnight were diluted with fresh medium at an OD595 of 0.001 and grown in 15 ml tubes at 37 °C for 24 h. The cultured medium was transferred to microtubes and centrifuged in a microfuge at 15,000 rpm for 5 min. Each supernatant was sterilized twice using 0.22 μm Millex-GP filters (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). The supernatant samples were spread onto sheep blood agar plates (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan) and checked for sterilization by incubation at 37 °C. In order to fractionate the culture supernatant of the Δply mutant, Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) was added to the supernatant at 50 mM. The sample (10 ml) was passed through a DE52 (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) column (bed volume 2 ml) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). After washing the column with the same buffer, proteins were eluted with a buffer containing 250 mM NaCl and then with a buffer containing 350 mM NaCl. The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and a gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Two bands in a 350 mM NaCl eluate were excised and analyzed using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight peptide mass fingerprint (MALDI-TOF PMF) (Genomine Inc., Pohang, Korea)."
7,Results,
8,Formation of single- and mixed-species biofilms,"3.1 Formation of single- and mixed-species biofilms A. fumigatus conidia and S. pneumoniae were cultured separately in 24-well plates for 24 h, and the biofilms were stained with Calcofluor white and DAPI. Calcofluor white stains not only fungal bodies [35] but also fungal and pneumococcal extracellular matrices [14,36]. DAPI stains intracellular and extracellular DNA in biofilms [37]. The extracellular matrices of the biofilms for both A. fumigatus and S. pneumoniae contain extracellular DNA [38,39]. Fluorescent staining of the fungal and bacterial biofilms indicated that both contained an extracellular matrix (Fig. 1 a and b). The fungal biofilm was thicker than the pneumococcal biofilm. We investigated both microorganisms for the ability to grow simultaneously in a biofilm. The fungal conidia and pneumococci were mixed and cultured for 24 h. The mixed-species biofilm harbored no mycelium and seemed to be primarily a pneumococcal biofilm (Fig. 1c), indicating that pneumococci had significantly suppressed the fungal growth. To confirm this result, the time course of fungal growth in the fungal biofilm and the mixed-species biofilm was determined by the counting of colonies (Fig. 1d). The number of viable fungal cells in the single-species biofilm was increased with culture time. In the mixed-species biofilm, however, the approximate 1 × 105 number of cells remained almost unchanged with time. Thus, pneumococci had suppressed both the fungal proliferation and the mycelial formation in the mixed-species biofilm but did not completely kill the fungal cells. Next, we addressed whether pneumococci could disrupt the preformed fungal biofilm. The fungal biofilm formation was carried out for 24 or 48 h, and pneumococci were added. At a total culture time of 72 h, the biofilms were stained with fluorescent dyes as described above. The fungal single-species biofilm developed a dense mycelium (Fig. 2 a). On the other hand, fragmentation of the mycelia progressed with time, when preformed fungal biofilms were co-cultured with pneumococci for 24 or 48 h (Fig. 2b and c). Details of single- and mixed-species biofilms were observed by SEM. The fungal biofilm contained a mycelium, conidial heads, and an extracellular matrix (Fig. 3 a, d). When the 48-h preformed fungal biofilm was co-cultured with pneumococci for 24 h, the mycelium was fragmented (Fig. 3b), as shown by CLSM. Hyphae were embedded in the pneumococcal biofilm instead of the fungal extracellular matrix, and many pneumococci adhered to the hypha (Fig. 3e). Fragmentation of the mycelium progressed, and hyphae were disrupted into fine filaments when the 24-h preformed fungal biofilm was co-cultured with pneumococci for 48 h (Fig. 3c, f)."
9,Pneumococcal culture supernatant contains mycelial fragmentation activity,"3.2 Pneumococcal culture supernatant contains mycelial fragmentation activity Pneumococci have various virulent factors [40]. Pneumolysin, which is produced by virtually all clinical isolates of pneumococci [41], is a major virulent factor [20]. We investigated whether pneumolysin could act as a mycelial fragmentation factor. To this aim, a ply deletion (Δply) mutant of S. pneumoniae P02-303 was constructed according to a method described previously [34]. As much as 8.8 μg/ml of pneumolysin was released to the culture medium [42]. The wild-type pneumococci were cultured for 24 h, and the culture supernatant and biofilm were recovered. Pneumolysin was detected in both samples by immunoblotting. The amount of the toxin in the culture supernatant relative to the biofilm was 32.5 ± 1.77% (Fig. 4 a). The loss of pneumolysin production of the Δply mutant was also confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 4b). Then, we examined whether the culture supernatants of wild-type and Δply mutant pneumococci exhibited fragmentation activity. Not only the culture supernatant of the wild-type strain but also that of the Δply mutant strain could fragment the mycelium (Fig. 4c), suggesting that S. pneumoniae produced a fragmentation factor that differed from pneumolysin."
10,Involvement of hydrogen peroxide produced by S. pneumoniae in mycelial fragmentation,"3.3 Involvement of hydrogen peroxide produced by S. pneumoniae in mycelial fragmentation The culture supernatant of Δply mutant pneumococci was subjected to anion-exchange chromatography using a DE52 open column. Pneumolysin is abundant in the culture supernatant of the wild-type strain and has an isoelectric point of 5.2 [41]. The acidic nature of pneumolysin causes its binding to DE52. The Δply mutant strain was used to facilitate identification of a mycelial fragmentation factor by DE52 column chromatography. The flow-through fraction and the 500 mM NaCl elution fraction were recovered. The 24-h preformed fungal biofilm was further cultured in the medium containing either or both fractions for 24 h. Neither of these fractions individually showed fragmentation activity (Fig. 5 b and c), but they did show activity when combined (Fig. 5d). When the flow-through fraction was heat-treated at 60 °C for 30 min, the medium containing both fractions retained its activity (Fig. 5e). On the other hand, the medium containing the flow-through fraction and the heat-treated eluate showed remarkably weak activity (Fig. 5f). These results suggest that the eluate contains an enzyme and that there is a substrate in the flow-through fraction. Next, proteins adsorbed on the column were fractionated by stepwise elution with 250 mM and 350 mM NaCl (Fig. 6 ). Each eluted fraction was combined with the flow-through fraction and used in the mycelial fragmentation experiment. Only 350 mM NaCl eluate exhibited fragmentation activity when it was combined with the flow-through fraction (data not shown). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight peptide mass fingerprint (MALDI-TOF PMF) revealed that the two proteins that were concentrated only in the 350 mM NaCl eluate were enolase (46 kDa) and lactate oxidase (42 kDa), which are produced by pneumococci. These enzymes might have been released from the pneumococci via autolysis [43]. Enolase and lactate oxidase are involved in glycolysis and a downstream metabolic reaction, respectively. Pyruvate, a final product of glycolysis, is converted to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase under anaerobic conditions. Conversely, lactate oxidase oxidizes lactate to produce pyruvate and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of oxygen [44]. Hydrogen peroxide produced by S. pneumoniae kills Staphylococcus aureus, and its bactericidal effect is inhibited in the presence of catalase [45]. In addition, hydrogen peroxide induces DNA damage and apoptosis in lung cells, which are suppressed by catalase [46]. Thus, we supposed that hydrogen peroxide might cause mycelial fragmentation. The preformed fungal biofilms were co-cultured using either a wild-type or Δply mutant strain in the presence or absence of catalase. Both strains could fragment the mycelium (Fig. 7 b, d), but their fragmentation activity was significantly inhibited in the presence of catalase (Fig. 7c, e), suggesting involvement of hydrogen peroxide in mycelial fragmentation. To confirm this, we examined whether enzymatically produced hydrogen peroxide could also fragment the mycelium or not (Fig. 8 ). The mycelium kept its network in the presence of lactate or lactate oxidase (Fig. 8b and c). Severe fragmentation was observed when the fungal biofilm was incubated in the presence of lactate and lactate oxidase (Fig. 8d), but the severe fragmentation was completely inhibited by catalase (Fig. 8e). These results suggest that hydrogen peroxide produced by pneumococci, as well as that produced by the pneumococcal enzyme that is released by pneumococcal autolysis, causes mycelial fragmentation."
11,Discussion,"Infection with multiple respiratory pathogens would be more difficult to treat than that from a single pathogen. The affected area of a patient would host various interactions among pathogens. A. fumigatus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are often isolated from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients [47,48]. CF is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder, which is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene, and primarily affects the digestive system and lungs [49]. P. aeruginosa at a density of more than 1 × 105 cells/ml kills fungal conidia at a rate that can reach 99.9% when both are cocultured simultaneously. P. aeruginosa, however, showed no fungicidal effect on preformed fungal biofilm [50]. Small heat-stable molecules produced by P. aeruginosa are known to inhibit the biofilm formation of fungal conidia, but these have shown a weak effect on preformed fungal biofilm [51]. When A. fumigatus and P. aeruginosa formed a mixed-species biofilm, P. aeruginosa exhibited lower antibiotic susceptibility compared with its existence in a single-species biofilm, whereas A. fumigatus showed similar antifungal drug susceptibility in both single- and mixed-species biofilms [50]. In the mixed-species biofilms, P. aeruginosa increased the production of elastase [52]. Pseudomonas elastase is a virulence factor that degrades various host defense molecules such as collagen, elastin, tight-junction proteins, and immune response proteins [53–56]. These developments suggest that the virulence of P. aeruginosa would be elevated by interactions with A. fumigatus in the mixed-species biofilm and that CF patients who experience a co-colonization by A. fumigatus and P. aeruginosa in their lungs could have a worse prognosis. An antibiosis effect by Staphylococcus aureus on A. fumigatus has also been reported [57]. In the mixed-species biofilm of A. fumigatus and S. aureus, the mycelial network was immature, and the hyphae were very short and thin. It was unclear, however, which bacterial factor could affect the fungal biofilm. Our data indicated that heat-sensitive factors released from S. pneumoniae are involved in disruption of the mycelial network of A. fumigatus biofilm. Humans inhale hundreds of A. fumigatus conidia daily, and these reach the alveoli of the lungs [58]. The conidia are rapidly cleared by alveolar macrophage and the mucociliary escalator in immunocompetent hosts [59]. In CF patients, however, dysfunction of the mucociliary escalator leads to persistent infection by the fungus and causes immunoglobulin E-mediated sensitivity to A. fumigatus and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis [60–62]. S. pneumoniae is known to persist in CF lungs and is pathogenic within the CF community [63]. In addition, the composition of the microbial species in CF lungs is associated with functionality, and the presence of S. pneumoniae causes a severe decline in 1-s forced expiratory volume [64]. A. fumigatus and S. pneumoniae have been simultaneously isolated from CF patients [29] and also isolated as copathogens from patients with invasive S. pneumoniae infections [30,31]. There could be interactions between the two microorganisms in the lungs of CF patients. In this study, S. pneumoniae disrupted preformed A. fumigatus biofilms and formed a pneumococcus-dominant biofilm. Hydrogen peroxide is produced by both pneumococci and the lactate oxidase that is released by pneumococcal autolysis. This hydrogen peroxide causes mycelial fragmentation, which suggests that A. fumigatus and S. pneumoniae could not co-exist in biofilm. However, A. fumigatus and S. pneumoniae might form separate biofilms. If A. fumigatus and S. pneumoniae are simultaneously detected in a patient's tracheobronchial aspirate fluids or sputa, this does not necessarily mean that the two pathogens are present in the same part of the patient's respiratory system. Thus, even if the two pathogens are in a competitive relationship, it would be consistent if both were simultaneously detected in the patient. Regev-Yochay et al. has reported that hydrogen peroxide produced by S. pneumoniae kills Staphylococcus aureus [45]. Taken together, S. pneumoniae might use hydrogen peroxide to eliminate other pathogenic bacteria and fungi to form S. pneumoniae-dominant or single-species biofilms in a host."
