0,Introduction,"Energy shortage and environmental protection are the critical issues of concern in current world, and the disposal of wastes through 3R strategy (Reduce-Recovery-Recycle) can alleviate to a certain extent. Food waste is one of the main components of organic solid waste or municipal solid waste, which is defined as the final discards of food processing industries or household that have not been recycled or used for other purposes [1]. It is estimated that the food waste produced by each person is between 124 and 154 kg per year, and the global edible food waste/loss amounted to 1.3 billion tons [2]. According to the statistical data in European Union, the amount of food waste generated will reach approximately 126 million in 2020 [3]. The compositions of food waste are complex, yet they contain carbohydrate, amino acids, lipids and other high-value constituents, which can be regard as the potential resources for the production of chemicals and fuels [4]. If the food waste cannot be handled properly, it will cause a series of environmental problems like unpleasant odor, groundwater contamination, greenhouse gas emissions and so on. Altogether, the related environmental issues and massive waste of resource have prompted widespread attention and research on the conversion of food waste via waste-to-energy processes. There are several disposal technologies for food waste treatment or valorization, including landfilling, animal feed, biological processed (composting, anaerobic digestion, fermentation) and thermal processes (pyrolysis, gasification, combustion) [5]. The characteristics, advantages and disadvantages of these technologies have been summarized and compared in previous references, it can be found that anaerobic digestion and composting are currently the main treatment methods for food waste [5,6]. Nonetheless, both these two technologies have problems with long processing cycles and greenhouse gas emissions, and there still exist a certain amount of residual cannot be treated. Thermal processes such as pyrolysis have gradually become a potential alternative food waste disposal method at present, since the unique advantages in reduction, recycling and energy utilization [7]. Pyrolysis of food waste refers to the thermal decomposition of organic matter in waste under oxygen-free conditions, which converts waste into non-condensable gas, condensable liquid oil and solid char. Compared with the traditional food waste disposal methods, the products obtained from pyrolysis can be valorization used in various aspects, for example, the gaseous products and liquid oil can be converted into high-purity gases (hydrogen, methane, ethylene, etc.), platform compounds and alternative fuels, and the biochar can be further activated into activated carbon for wastewater treatment, soil remediation or preparation of carbon-based materials [8]. The pyrolysis process of food waste and typical components in food waste have been conducted by analytical instruments (e.g. thermogravimetric analyzer and its combined equipment, thermal pyrolyzer and its combined equipment, etc.) and laboratory scale reactors (e.g. fixed bed, fluidized bed, etc.) in recent years [4,9–11]. These investigations had discussed the thermal degradation characteristics, product composition, product distribution, and kinetics of food waste under different operating conditions. There are various pyrolysis modes were applied in food waste and typical components to obtain the targeted yield, for example, slow pyrolysis, fast pyrolysis, microwave pyrolysis, solar pyrolysis, etc. [8,12]. The main products obtained by different pyrolysis modes are different. The preparation of bio-char or bio-oil by waste pyrolysis has been widely studied, but to produce gases or volatiles is also a valuable way of waste valorization. In the actual production or waste treatment process, the high-temperature fast pyrolysis is more suitable, because it can produce more volatiles for further synthesize of fuels and chemicals or power generation. However, the impact of operating parameters on the food waste fast pyrolysis process is not comprehensive, which is the one of critical influence factors in the industrialization process. There are many operating parameters could affect the pyrolysis behavior and products distribution, including temperature, residence time, atmosphere, particle size, catalyst and so on. It is important to realize the relationship between operating parameters and desired experimental results when designing and operating reactor [13]. And the exploration of operation parameters is also to find the most suitable conditions for the desired products. In addition, the food waste pyrolysis processes were basically carried out under nitrogen or other inert gases, whereas the food waste pyrolysis in hydrogen-containing atmosphere has not been studied before. The previous references had been proved that the property and quality of products were improved during fast hydropyrolysis of coal and biomass [14]. Lu et al. [15] had been proved that fast non-catalytic pyrolysis of poplar wood in the presence of hydrogen could improve volatiles yield and phenols selectivity. The hydrogen in carrier gas could react with volatiles in products during pyrolysis process because of its reducibility, such as addition cracking, aromatization, hydrodeoxygenation and other reactions [14]. In general, the hydro-pyrolysis and hydro-conversion of coal, biomass and wastes required high pressure and catalyst, which caused the increasing of processing costs and operating conditions [16]. The difference is that the rapid pyrolysis in laboratory-scale reactors can achieve the effect of hydrogen radical participation through the hydrogen stream, without the need for pressurization. During the fast pyrolysis process in the presence of hydrogen, the primary volatiles (mainly heavy fraction) would be decomposed and reformed via secondary reactions, and the char or semi-coke could be gasified to some extent through hydro-gasification [17]. Although there is a preliminary understanding of the pyrolysis mechanism, it is still necessary to further analyze and discuss the pyrolysis behavior and product composition of food waste pyrolysis under hydrogen atmosphere. Thence, it is necessary to explore the products yield and distribution during high-temperature fast pyrolysis process of food waste with H2 in carrier gas. In this investigation, the fast pyrolysis of food waste was completed on the laboratory-scale downdraft tube reactor (also named free-fall bed, drop tube reactor, etc.) at the presence of hydrogen in carrier gas. Three typical operating parameters (pyrolysis temperature, carrier gas flow rate and hydrogen content) were selected to explore the impact on the pyrolysis process. The three-phase product yield, gaseous products composition and quality, bio-oil composition and distribution affected by different operating conditions were also analyzed and discussed. It is hoped that the experiments could provide data reference and theoretical basis for the large-scale test or industrialization of food waste pyrolysis."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Sample pretreatment and characterization,"2.1 Sample pretreatment and characterization The food waste samples, obtained from the canteen of the China University of Petroleum (East China)-Qingdao campus, were selected as raw materials for experiments. In this investigation, the food waste was the solid residues from which water and oil were removed, mainly including leftovers (rice, meat, vegetables) and a small amount of melon peel. The collected food waste was dried on-site under the sun for half a month to release moisture naturally. After the separation of incombustible materials (sand, glass, metal, etc.) by sorting process, put the sample in a vacuum drying oven with the temperature of 105 °C for 24 h. In order to ensure the uniformity of the sample, the food waste was crushed and mixed thoroughly. Before characterization and experimentation, the pretreatment sample were screened to a particle size between 8 and 10 mesh and placed in zip-lock bags. Table 1 listed the results of proximate analysis, ultimate analysis and HHV for food waste. The proximate analysis was carried out on an Automatic Industrial Analyzer (JHGF-3, JINHUI, China), and the content of moisture, ash, volatile matter and fixed carbon calculated according to Chinese National Standard GB/T28731-2012 (proximate analysis of solid biofuels) were 5.10%, 7.41%, 66.47% and 21.02%, respectively. The ultimate analysis was completed by an Elemental Analyzer (Vario EL cube, Elementar, Germany), of which the content for carbon was 43.38%, hydrogen was 6.26%, sulfur was 0.96%, nitrogen was 4.49% and oxygen (ash-free basis) was 37.50%. At the same time, the value of higher heating value (HHV) calculated based on ultimate analysis results (HHV = 0.3880[C] + 0.4022[H] + 0.1987[N]-0.0354[O] [18]) was 18.91 MJ kg−1."
3,Experimental apparatus and procedure,"2.2 Experimental apparatus and procedure The laboratory-scale downdraft tube reactor was designed to investigate the fast pyrolysis of food waste with hydrogen atmosphere. Fig. 1 displayed the schematic diagram of the experimental apparatus, which mainly including carrier gas supply system, temperature control system, feeding system, main reaction system and products collect system. The main reaction system was composed of a resistance furnace with the maximum temperature of 1000 °C and a heat-resistant stainless-steel tube with the internal diameter of 20 mm. The total length of the reactor tube was 120 cm, with the stainless-steel mesh at 20 cm from the bottom. The products collect system was made up of two parts including a polytetrafluoroethylene rod (filled up with filter paper and cotton wool as Fig. 1 shown) to collect and adsorb bio-oil and a gas bag to gather gaseous products, respectively. Before the start of each set of experiments, the reactor tube was heated to desired temperature by resistance furnace, and the carrier gas flow rate of hydrogen (H2, 99.999%) and nitrogen (N2, 99.999%) was set to experimental value by flowmeter. The specific operating parameters of each experiment were listed in Table 2 . Then, approximately 2.0 g food waste samples were placed on the hopper of feeding system after the temperature and carrier gas flow rate to be stabilized. After opening the valve, the sample quickly fallen in the reaction tube under the co-action of gravity and carrier gas. The residence time of all experiments was 2 min, and the char remained on the stainless-steel mesh, volatiles including condensable liquid oil and non-condensable gases entered the product collection system. The volatile products first went through bio-oil collector and the condensable oil or tar was almost completely adsorbed by filter paper and cotton wool, and then the non-condensable gases were collected by gas bags."
4,Gaseous products analysis,"2.3 Gaseous products analysis The composition of gaseous products was analyzed by a Gas Chromatograph (GC SP-6890, Lunan-Ruihong Inc., China) installed with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID). The temperature of the TCD maintained at 70 °C for inorganic gases (H2, N2, CO, CO2, etc.) analysis, and the FID was used to detect hydrocarbon gases (CH4, C2H6, C2H4, etc.). The temperature program of FID was set as follow: i). kept at 70 °C for 3 min, ii). increased to 160 °C with 5 °C min−1, iii). held at 160 °C for 10 min. High purity argon (Ar, 99.999%) was used as carrier gas, hydrogen generator and air generator were adopted to provide hydrogen and air for detection. It is worth noting that the GC instrument needs to be calibrated with standard gas before measurement. Due to the limitations of standard gas and GC instrument, the hydrocarbon gases with more than four atoms cannot be analyzed. However, this result does not have a major impact on the analysis of major gas products since the content of C4+ is not high. According to related literatures [19,20], the calculation formula or evaluation index of gaseous products were shown as follow. The total molar yield Y g (mmol g−1) of gaseous products (exclude carrier gas), fraction molar Y f (mmol g−1) yield of each components and molar percentage C mol,f (mol%) of each components (exclude carrier gas) were calculated by following formula: (1) Y g = 1 − C N 2 q cg t / 22.4 C N 2 m (2) Y f = Y g C f / 1 − C N 2 (3) C mol , f = Y f / Y g where C N2, C f (%) represented the percentage content of nitrogen and each gas composition obtained from GC analysis, q cg (mL min−1) represented the flow rate of carrier gas, t (min) and m (g) represented reaction time and feeding mass of samples. The lower heating value (LHV, MJ Nm−3) of pyrolysis gas was obtained from: (4) LHV Gas = ∑ Q f C mol , f f = H 2 CO CH 4 C 2 H 4 C 2 H 6 C 3 H 6 C 3 H 8 . where Q f (MJ Nm−3) and C mol,f (mol%) was the LHV value and molar percentage of gas components (H2, CO, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, C3H8) in pyrolysis gas."
5,Bio-oil analysis,"2.4 Bio-oil analysis In order to grasp the product components of bio-oil, a Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS SCION 456-GC-SQ, Bruker, Germany) was used for qualitative and quantitative analysis. Before testing, the liquid-adsorption filter paper was soaked in acetone solution (AR, ≥99.5%, CAS: 67-64-1) until the bio-oil is completely dissolved, and then through extraction, filtration and rotary evaporation to obtain pure bio-oil. Two microliters of the prepared bio-oil were injected into capillary column (60 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, Agilent DB-5MS) of instrument with the carried gas (He, 99.999%) of 1.0 mL min−1 and the split radio of 50:1. The column oven temperature program settings were as follow: i) maintained at 40 °C for 1 min, ii). heated to 280 °C with 5 °C min−1, iii). held at 280 °C for 1 min. The MS instrument was worked under full scan mode with the mass-to-charge ratio between 15 and 550 au and electron ionization mode at 70 eV. To eliminate the influence of acetone on the peak area of bio-oil components, the peak time of the total ion chromatogram was set at a delay of 400 s after the start of detection. The identification of bio-oil chemical composition was based on the matching degree between plot of search spectrum and NIST library."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Product yield,"3.1 Product yield 3.1.1 Effect of pyrolysis temperature The pyrolysis final temperature has been proved to be one of the most significant influence factors, which provided the heat needed for thermal decomposition during pyrolysis process [21]. The product yield of the fast pyrolysis process at different final temperature with the carrier gas flow rate of 150 mL min−1 and hydrogen content of 10% in downdraft tube reactor were shown in Fig. 2(a). It can be observed obviously that the gas yield increased from 37.15% to 61.76% within the temperature ranging from 700 °C to 900 °C, while the yield of bio-oil decreased from 29.88% to 7.62%. According to Opatokun et al. [22], the main weight loss stage for food waste pyrolysis was from 200 °C to 550 °C, and the secondary cracking of pyrolytic volatiles occurred in 550–900 °C. Along with the increasing of final temperature, the secondary cracking reaction of pyrolytic volatiles, mainly refer to bio-oil or tar, became more and more intense to produce gaseous products. Moreover, the yield of gas was increasing accompanied by the significant reduction in bio-oil yield under the condition of high temperature fast pyrolysis [23]. Thus, higher pyrolysis temperature can effectively reduce the content of bio-oil in pyrolysis products. As the pyrolysis temperature increased, the yield of char decreased slightly from 32.99% to 30.62%. The reduction in char yield at higher temperature might be attributed to the secondary pyrolysis of char residues. In addition, fast pyrolysis conditions were also not conducive to the formation of char, because the higher heating rate will lead to rapid breakage of chemical bonds, and volatiles evaporated without the condensation reaction to generate char [24]. 3.1.2 Effect of carrier gas flow rate The carrier gas flow rate also belongs to one of the most important influence factors. It affected fluidization rate, volatiles residence time, heat transfer characteristics and secondary side-reactions during fast pyrolysis process [25]. Fig. 2(b) presented the product yield with different carrier gas flow rates (100 mL min−1, 150 mL min−1, 200 mL min−1 and 250 mL min−1) under the pyrolysis temperature of 900 °C and hydrogen content of 10%. As the flow rate of carrier gas increasing, the gas yield increased from 59.04% to 64.79% and the bio-oil yield decreased from 8.99% to 5.17%, respectively. The degree of mixing between carrier gas and feedstocks improved with the increase of gas flow rate, and thus the generation of volatiles was enhanced. Meanwhile, the shorter residence time of volatiles reduced the possibility of repolymerization and polycondensation reactions between pyrolytic vapor [26]. In other word, the heat transfer efficiency would become worse because of the excessive flow rate, thereby suppressing the production of bio-oil. There was also a saying that the increase in the carrier gas flow rate will reduce the secondary cracking reaction of bio-oil and lead to the increase in the bio-oil content [21]. However, the influence of carrier gas flow rate or residence time on the bio-oil formation process was much higher than the secondary cracking reaction of bio-oil/tar. Therefore, the main reason for the change in bio-oil content is the tar formation during the pyrolysis of food waste. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the variation of char yield was not very significant, decreased from 31.97% to 30.04% with the increase of flow rate. This slight reduction of char content might be attributed to that higher flow rate of carrier gas was able to remove the volatile products from main reaction zone quickly to minimize the secondary reactions for char formation. 3.1.3 Effect of hydrogen content The pyrolysis atmosphere also has an effect on product yield and composition, especially in the presence of hydrogen. The yields of char, bio-oil and gas at different hydrogen (0%, 5%, 10% and 15%) with 900 °C and 100 mL min−1 were given in Fig. 2(c). It can be found that the gas yield increased from 58.56% to 63.61% with the hydrogen content increased to 10%, and then decreased to 61.57% with the continuous increase in hydrogen content. The heavy fraction in primary volatile vapors underwent deeper decomposition and reforming process to produce light gaseous products under H2 atmosphere [17]. The trend of bio-oil yield was opposite to that of gas, which showed as decreased first and then increased and the lowest yield was 5.02% under the hydrogen content of 10%. It can be explained that the presence of hydrogen promoted the secondary cracking reaction, and prevented volatile products polymerization reaction by deactivating the free radicals [27]. At the same time, the oxygen-containing functional groups converted into water vapor with the action of H2. According to the results shown in Fig. 2(c), the excessive hydrogen concentration can inhibit gas production and promote bio-oil formation to a certain extent. However, in general, the gas yield under the hydrogen atmosphere was higher than the pure nitrogen atmosphere, while the bio-oil yield under the hydrogen atmosphere was lower than the pure nitrogen atmosphere. The char yield tended to increase first and then decrease with the hydrogen content, but the change in yield fluctuation was not severe. It can be seen that the char content in the H2 atmosphere was slightly higher than that in the N2 atmosphere, because the bio-oil/tar vapor undergoes re-polymerization when passing through the char under the action of hydrogen. The hydrogen in carrier gas reacted with waste and pyrolysis products to generate or transfer into volatiles products and char during primary pyrolysis, secondary cracking and char gasification process."
8,Gaseous products in volatiles,"3.2 Gaseous products in volatiles The gaseous products in pyrolytic volatiles mainly contained hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and small amounts of light hydrocarbons (C2H4, C2H6, C3H6 and C3H8, etc.). It is well known that different operating conditions have a greater impact on the composition and quality of the gaseous products. Tables 3–5 listed the gaseous products composition and gas evaluation under the condition of different pyrolysis temperature, carrier gas flow rate and hydrogen content, respectively. The gaseous products yield and total molar yield represented the amount of gas generated during food waste pyrolysis process, and the lower heating value (LHV), sum of H2 and CO percentage (H2 + CO), stoichiometric ratio of H2 to CO (H2/CO) referred the quality of syngas. Different qualities of syngas have different properties and applications, for example, high H2 + CO content indicated that the syngas has strong reducing ability, whereas the syngas with the H2/CO ratio between 1.0 and 2.0 was commonly used for the synthesis of syngas-based chemicals [28,29]. 3.2.1 Effect of pyrolysis temperature Table 3 summarized the gaseous products yield, composition and quality under the influence of pyrolysis final temperature. As the pyrolysis temperature rose from 700 °C to 900 °C, the gaseous product yield and total molar yield increased from 56.51% to 68.77% and 12.33 mmol g−1 to 20.97 mmol g−1, respectively. The thermochemical conversion process is an endothermic process, thereby increasing the temperature is beneficial to the thermal decomposition reaction [30]. Higher pyrolysis temperature can not only improve the yield of gaseous product, but also affect the gas composition. The molar percentage of H2, CO, CH4 and C2H2 increased in different degrees, while the molar percentage of other gas including CO2, C2H6, C3H6 and C3H8 decreased. The reason for this phenomenon is that high temperature will strengthen the function of free radical mechanism reaction, thereby promoting the formation of hydrogen, methane and lower olefins [31]. According to Table 3, CO2 was the major component of gaseous product at low pyrolysis temperature, and H2, CO and CH4 were the main components in gas products along with the increasing of temperature. In general, the fast pyrolysis process of biomass or waste at high temperature can be regarded as three stages, which were initial decomposition to release a large amount of gas, tar secondary cracking to produce light hydrocarbons and small molecular weight gas, and char gasification to generate CO2, CO and H2, respectively [32]. During the fast pyrolysis process, the hydrogen was mainly generated from the cracking reaction and dehydrogenation of heavy hydrocarbons, while methane came from the decomposition of methoxy group and reorganization of methylene. These reactions were all affected by temperature, which will promote or enhance the occurrence of the reaction when the temperature increases [33]. In addition, the Boudouard reaction (C + CO2 → 2CO) was promoted under high temperature conditions, resulting in CO content increasing and CO2 content decreasing [34]. The molar percentage of H2 + CO under different pyrolysis final temperature was increase from 38.65 mol% to 48.43 mol%, which indicated that the gaseous product produced at high temperatures had a strong reducing ability. The increasing of pyrolysis temperature was beneficial for the production of H2 and conversion of CO. At the same time, the stoichiometric ratio of H2 to CO (H2/CO) was also increased from 1.21 to 1.28. The lower heating value (LHV) of gaseous products at 900 °C was 14.62 MJ Nm−3, which was higher than that of low pyrolysis final temperature. It proved that gaseous product generated at high temperature had potential for cogeneration or power generation. Similar research had been proposed that the gas yield and LHV reached a maximum at 900 °C during municipal solid waste pyrolysis process [35]. 3.2.2 Effect of carrier gas flow rate The effect of carrier gas flow rate on the yield, composition and quality of gaseous products was listed in Table 4. It can be found that the gaseous product yield decreased remarkably from 78.72% to 54.69%, and the total molar yield reduced from 22.02 mmol g−1 to 17.06 mmol g−1 with the increase of carrier gas flow rate. This can be contributed to the faster flow rate of carrier gas could shorten the secondary reactions of pyrolytic volatiles and reduce the possibility of char gasification process [36]. The change of carrier gas flow rate had a great influence on gas composition from the results in Table 4, which was reflected as the molar percentage of H2 decreased from 29.18 mol% to 25.73 mol%, CO2 increased from 10.54 mol% to 19.27 mol%, CH4 decreased from 12.68 mol% to 10.66 mol%, and other gases showed a downward trend overall with the flow rate increasing. In fact, increasing the carrier gas flow rate was substantially shorter the reaction residence time of pyrolysis process [37]. Fast flow rate of carrier gas resulted in rapid removal of pyrolytic volatiles from reaction zone, thus, there was not enough time for secondary reactions of gas-phase products and char gasification. According to Table 4, the gas evaluation index like H2 + CO, H2/CO and LHV all had a tendency to decrease with the increasing of carrier gas flow rate. It can be found that the H2 + CO decreased from 51.58 mol% to 47.87 mol%, H2/CO decreased from 1.30 to 1.16, and LHV decreased from 14.90 MJ Nm−3 to 13.36 MJ Nm−3. Although the increase of gas flow rate can bring better material fluidization, it would reduce the gas yield, gas composition and gas quality to a certain extent. Therefore, under the condition of ensuring sufficient carrier gas atmosphere, adjusting the appropriate carrier gas flow rate to provide enough residence time is beneficial for the thermal decomposition and secondary reactions. 3.2.3 Effect of hydrogen content It can be seen from the gas yield influenced by hydrogen content shown in Table 5 that the gaseous product yield and total molar yield were all increased with the improvement of hydrogen content. The gas yield and total molar yield of pyrolysis under nitrogen were 65.73% and 11.42 mmol g−1, while the value was increased up to 78.98% and 22.36 mmol g−1 under hydrogen content of 15%. The pyrolysis process will be more inclined to release volatiles under hydrogen conditions, by inhibiting the polymerization of free radicals and promoting the hydrogenation of char or tar [38]. According to Table 5, the molar percentage of H2, CH4 and other light hydrocarbons (CnHm) all had a certain increasing at the presence of H2 when compared to the pyrolysis process under N2 atmosphere. Unlike random chain scission of macromolecules in nitrogen atmosphere, the pyrolysis in hydrogen atmosphere could cause the systematic or orderly breaking of the chemical bonds of the macromolecules [39]. Such bond cleavage at the presence of hydrogen was affected by many factors, such as the bond strength, chemical bond types, free radical stability, etc. However, the molar percentage of H2 and CH4 reached their maximum when the hydrogen content was 10%, which were 29.18 mol% and 12.68 mol%, respectively. The experimental results showed that increasing the hydrogen content in the carrier gas may not always increase the hydrogen and methane content. Some reactions between pyrolysis gases or with char at the presence of H2 such as methanation reaction and dry reforming reaction may result in the decreased of gaseous product content. The molar percentage of CO2 decreased from 13.60 mol% to 10.54 mol% along with the hydrogen content increased to 10%, which can be attributed to that the oxygen-containing functional group reacted with hydrogen to generate water vapor. Correspondingly, the molar content of CO increased to 22.40% at the hydrogen content of 10%. Under hydrogen pyrolysis conditions, the hydrogen may cause the decomposition of stable oxygen groups of conjugated polycyclic on char, thereby releasing CO and CO2 [40]. In addition, several reactions might occur between gaseous products or gas and carbon in char at high temperature including the Boudouard reaction, water-gas reaction, water-gas shift reaction and methanation reaction, thus, caused the molar percentage fluctuation of CO and CO2. Table 5 also given the gas evaluation index of gas under different hydrogen content, the H2 + CO, H2/CO and LHV showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing slightly with the increase of hydrogen content. There was a maximum at a hydrogen content of 10%, where the H2 + CO was 51.58 mol%, H2/CO was 1.30, LHV was 14.90 MJ Nm−3. The index of gaseous product quality was influenced by the composition of gaseous products, so that the change of hydrogen content in carrier gas would affect the gas quality. Based on the experimental results and the above analysis, high hydrogen content was not necessarily beneficial for gas composition. The main gaseous product components were converted to each other under the condition of excess hydrogen via gas shift reaction and char gasification process."
9,Bio-oil in volatiles,"3.3 Bio-oil in volatiles The bio-oil referred to the condensable liquid products in volatiles during food waste pyrolysis process, including oxygen-containing compounds such as (ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, phenols and acids), heterocyclic compounds (polysaccharides, nitrogen-containing) and macromolecular hydrocarbons (PAHs, long chain acids), etc. In general, the high molecular weight compounds, also name tar, were the main components in the food waste pyrolytic bio-oil.. According to International Energy Agency (IEA), the tar compounds include all condensable organic hydrocarbons with a higher molecular weight or higher dew point than benzene [41]. The presence of tar would not only affect the quality of gas or bio-oil, but also brought several operational problems in actual production, such as corrosion reactors, blocking filter elements, etc. Hence, the removal or conversion of tar during pyrolysis treatment process seemed to be one of the greatest technical problem that need to be overcome. In order to effectively solve the tar problem, it is necessary to study the bio-oil composition and typical compounds under different pyrolysis conditions. In this investigation, the specific product composition in bio-oil was detected and analyzed by GC–MS, which can be summarized as aliphatics, aromatics, phenols, alcohols, nitrogen-containing heterocycles, carbonyl compounds (aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and carboxylic acid derivatives) and other compounds (amines, nitriles and amides), respectively. Table S1 (in Supplementary materials) listed the reaction time, relative content, formula and compound name of bio-oil composition with the temperature of 900 °C, flow rate of 100 mL min−1 and hydrogen content of 10% as an example. The bio-oil referred to the condensable liquid products in volatiles during food waste pyrolysis process, including oxygen-containing compounds such as (ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, phenols and acids), heterocyclic compounds (polysaccharides, nitrogen-containing) and macromolecular hydrocarbons (PAHs, long chain acids), etc. In general, the high molecular weight compounds, also name tar, were the main components in the food waste pyrolytic bio-oil.. According to International Energy Agency (IEA), the tar compounds include all condensable organic hydrocarbons with a higher molecular weight or higher dew point than benzene [41]. The presence of tar would not only affect the quality of gas or bio-oil, but also brought several operational problems in actual production, such as corrosion reactors, blocking filter elements, etc. Hence, the removal or conversion of tar during pyrolysis treatment process seemed to be one of the greatest technical problem that need to be overcome. In order to effectively solve the tar problem, it is necessary to study the bio-oil composition and typical compounds under different pyrolysis conditions. In this investigation, the specific product composition in bio-oil was detected and analyzed by GC–MS, which can be summarized as aliphatics, aromatics, phenols, alcohols, nitrogen-containing heterocycles, carbonyl compounds (aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and carboxylic acid derivatives) and other compounds (amines, nitriles and amides), respectively. Table S1 (in Supplementary materials) listed the reaction time, relative content, formula and compound name of bio-oil composition with the temperature of 900 °C, flow rate of 100 mL min−1 and hydrogen content of 10% as an example. 3.3.1 Effect of pyrolysis temperature The effect of pyrolysis temperature on bio-oil composition distribution and typical compounds were given in Fig. 3 . It can be inferred that the pyrolysis final temperature had a significant impact on the distribution of bio-oil composition and relative content of typical compounds. According to Fig. 3(a), aliphatic compounds including cycloalkanes and macromolecular hydrocarbons generally showed a decreasing trend with the temperature increased, while aromatic compounds including monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BTXs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) displayed a gradually increasing trend. This phenomenon can be explained by the higher pyrolysis temperature had a significant influence on macromolecules compounds and aromatics in tars [42]. The specific manifestation was that the macromolecular hydrocarbons would undergo chain-scission, cyclization, aromatization and isomerization reactions to generate aromatic hydrocarbons when the final pyrolysis temperature rose. The overall change trend of phenolic compounds was reduced from 30.97% to 12.37%, since the deoxygenation, dehydroxylation, aromatization and polymerization of phenols occurred at elevated temperature. But it showed an abnormality at 800 °C that the relative content was 28.45%, second only to 700 °C. Other oxygenates such as alcohols and carbonyls had also shown a decline overall, because these functional groups like -C-O, -OH, -C=O and -COOH were unstable at high temperature. This can be attributed to the hydrogen enhance oxygen removal via decarboxylation, decarbonylation, hydrodeoxygenation and deoxygenation reactions. However, these reactions were not obvious under non-catalytic conditions in the presence of hydrogen when compared with the catalytic hydro-pyrolysis process of biomass or waste [43,44]. It can be seen from Fig. 3(a) that nitrogen-containing heterocycles (N-heterocycles) were the major products species, and showed a tendency of increasing with the increase of final pyrolysis temperature. The relative content of N-containing heterocycles increased from 25.78% to 44.70%, which can be attributed to dehydrogenation, decarboxylation, dehydration, cyclization and dimerization reactions of amino acids or glucose depolymerization products in food waste, and these reactions became more intense as the pyrolysis temperature increased [11]. In addition, the Maillard reaction occurred between free amino-containing compounds and the carbonyl compounds under higher pyrolysis temperature also resulted in the increasing of N-containing heterocycles [45]. Other compounds mainly including amines, nitriles and amides, and the variation of relative content was increased first and then decreased overall. As the pyrolysis temperature increasing, long-chain amides would undergo chain scission to form small molecule amines, thus, the relative content of amides decreased and that of amines increased. And the deamination, cyclization and isomerization reactions also occurred in some amine and amide compounds [46]. Analogously, high temperature conditions will also lead to secondary cracking of macromolecular nitriles to generate small molecular weight nitriles and -CN groups to further form HCN. Fig. 3(b–d) displayed the influence of pyrolysis final temperature on typical compound species, including N-heterocycles, phenols and PAHs. According to Fig. 3(b), the relative content of indole, quinoline and benzo[c]cinnoline increased to 6.15%, 3.20% and 4.67% with temperature, respectively. This might contribute to the secondary cracking reactions of unstable nitrogen-containing char under higher temperature [47]. Other N-heterocycles like pyrrole and pyridine presented the gradual downward tendency of relative content, while pyridine had a maximum of 2.26% at 750 °C and pyrrole had a maximum of 1.81% at 800 °C. As the final temperature increasing, nitrogen in volatiles would convert into char and the remaining skeleton structure through cyclization, aromatization, and polymerization to form PAHs. It is worth mentioning that indole was the main products and remained prominent of all N-heterocycles, which was produced by decarboxylation, dehydroxylation and dehydration reactions of amino acids in proteins. From the Fig. 3(c), the relative content of n-methyl-phenol and n,m-dimethyl-phenol decreased from 16.61% to 4.15% and from 4.71% to 0.51%, while phenol increased first and then decreased and the maximum relative content was 8.40% at 850 °C. In general, the thermal cracking of oxygen-containing functional groups such as methoxy and aryl ether bond to form phenolic compounds occurred at the temperature between 600 °C and 800 °C [48]. However, the side-chain scission and dehydroxylation of phenols would become more and more intense along with the temperature increasing. It can be seen from Fig. 3(d) that the relative content of typical PAHs was all increased before 850 °C, since the aromatization, rearrangement, addition polymerization and condensation reactions of benzene ring skeleton, deoxy heterocyclic rings and deazacyclic rings happened [49]. As the pyrolysis final temperature increased, azulene, phenanthrene, biphenyl and anthracene still increased, while fluorene and 1-methyl-naphthalene decreased markedly. This phenomenon can be explained as that there was a competitive relationship between the formation and destruction of PAHs at higher temperatures, and some PAHs tended to undergo secondary reactions that caused mutual conversion. 3.3.2 Effect of carrier gas flow rate Fig. 4 presented the influence of carrier gas flow rate on bio-oil composition and typical compounds distribution in pyrolytic volatiles. The variation of bio-oil species with carrier gas flow was regular overall from Fig. 4(a). Specifically, the percentage of aliphatic, aromatic, alcohol and carbonyl species increased to 3.19%, 30.58%, 2.38% and 8.31% when the flow rate of carrier gas reached to 250 mL min−1. As previously mentioned, the gas flow rate change was to adjust the residence time of feedstocks in the downdraft tube reactor. Thence, faster flow rate resulted in shorter reaction times that the secondary cleavage of these compounds was insufficient. It's interesting that the relative content of aromatic still increased even with shorter reaction times, which was increased from 28.72% to 30.58%. This might be related to the presence of hydrogen in the carrier gas, hydrogen radicals could promote the production of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons to some extent [39]. The relative content of phenols was decreased first and then increased, which the minimum was 11.12% with the carrier gas flow rate of 200 mL min−1. Phenol and its derivatives generated from the combination of highly reactive phenolic hydroxyl groups and benzene ring radicals, which required sufficient response time to complete. Furthermore, the relative content of N-heterocycles and other compounds (amines, amides and nitriles) decreased from 48.07% to 42.03% and 2.68% to 1.63% with the increasing of flow rate. The reason for this change in product content was still not enough residence time to promote the conversion of N-heterocycles [50]. In addition, the chain cracking of long-chain nitriles and long-chain amides was also incomplete under the condition of faster carrier gas flow rate, so that the relative content decreased. The variation tendency of typical compounds with carrier gas flow rate was shown in Fig. 4(b–d). It can be seen from Fig. 4(b) that the relative content of pyridine and pyrrole decreased with carrier gas flow rate increasing, while that of indole, quinoline and benzo[c]cinnoline increased. Although the total amount of N-heterocycles gradually decreased, the content of indole, quinoline and benzo[c]cinnoline increased to a certain extent, indicating that the increase of the flow rate was beneficial to the conversion of other N-heterocycles to these products. At the same time, faster flow rate caused the incomplete cyclization of peptidic fragments, resulting in the decreasing of pyrrole and pyridine [44]. According to Fig. 4(c), the relative content phenol increased first and then decreased and the maximum value was 6.35% at 200 mL min−1, while n-methyl-phenol and n,m-dimethyl-phenol decreased from 5.72% to 3.54% and from 0.53% to 0.20%, respectively. The reason for decreasing of cresol and xylenol was that there was no enough residence time for the addition reactions between phenol and methyl radicals as the flow rate increased. The phenol content fluctuation was still affected by the carrier gas flow rate or residence time, but the specific impact is not clear in this investigation. From Fig. 4(d), as the flow rate of carrier gas gradually increased, the content of azulene and anthracene decreased, and that of phenanthrene, 1-methyl-naphthalene, biphenyl and fluorene increased. At the flow rate of 100 mL min−1, the relative content of typical PAHs (azulene, 1-methyl-naphthalene, biphenyl phenanthrene, anthracene and fluorene) was 7.90%, 3.07%, 1.99%, 6.44%, 2.31% and 0.40%, respectively. The high flow rate of carrier gas (less residence time) would weaken the thermal synthesis reactions between typical PAHs, and those PAHs could be converted into more stable macromolecular PAHs under high temperature and long residence time [51]. Thus, the relative content of PAHs fluctuated at different carrier gas flow rates. 3.3.3 Effect of hydrogen content The bio-oil composition distribution and typical compounds fluctuation caused by hydrogen content was given in Fig. 5 . It can be found that the relative content of aliphatic increased from 1.46% to 2.14%, aromatic increased from 28.13% to 38.70% and phenol increased from 7.16% to 12.67%, respectively. The results indicated that the presence of H2 promoted the formation of aromatic and phenolic compounds, because hydrogen can help stabilize active free radicals and intermediates during fast pyrolysis of food wastes [14]. Other oxygenated compounds including alcohol and carbonyl showed a decrease tendency along with the improvement of hydrogen content in carrier gas. The chain oxygenates could convert into light aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons via cracking or conversion reactions under the hydrogen atmosphere [17]. For nitrogen-containing compounds, the relative content of N-heterocycles decreased from 52.56% to 40.25% when the hydrogen content reached to 15%. And the percentage of others including amines, amides and nitriles also reduced, which decreased from 4.39% to 2.58%. The reduction of N-heterocycles might cause by the deamination reactions under the effect of hydrogen. During the pyrolysis process, the existence of hydrogen will affect the openness of the macromolecular structure and promote the removal of heteroatoms [52]. At the same time, amides and nitriles would also undergo cracking to release NH4 + in the presence of H2 [53]. Hence, the presence and content of H2 in carrier gas had a great influence on the distribution of N-containing compounds. Fig. 5(b–d) presented the relative content change of typical N-heterocycles, phenols and PAHs affected by H2 content in carrier gas. For N-heterocycles in Fig. 5(b), the relative content of indole decreased from 6.89% to 5.52% and benzo[c]cinnoline decreased from 4.29% to 3.56%, while other N-heterocycles manifested as a fluctuating trend. Overall, the content of quinoline decreased, pyrrole and pyridine increased. The results indicated that the presence of H2 could promote the conversion of polycyclic nitrogen-containing heterocycles to monocyclic nitrogen-containing heterocycles. Under the combination of high temperature and H+ radicals, the polymerization or ring-condensation reactions between heteromonocyclics were restrained. According to Fig. 5(c), the relative content of phenol, cresol and xylenol increased with the increasing of hydrogen concentration as a whole. The phenol content rose to 6.32% at the hydrogen content of 15% with fluctuation, n-methyl-phenol content increased first and then decreased and the maximum value was 5.72% at 10% hydrogen content, and n,m-dimethyl-phenol content changed slightly, which increased form 0.53% to 0.56% along with H2 content increasing. Zhang et al. [54] had been proved that non-catalytic pyrolysis of biomass in H2 atmosphere could improve the content of phenolic compounds to a certain degree. The formation of phenols in H2 atmosphere can be attributed to the further selective removal of side chains attached on benzene rings affected by hydrogen radical. It can be seen from Fig. 5(d) that the relative content of bicyclic aromatic increased overall, whereas that of tricyclic aromatics decreased when hydrogen content increased overall in carrier gas overall. In particular, azulene increased from 7.90% to 8.38%, 1-methyl-naphthalene and biphenyl decreased first and then increased, phenanthrene and anthracene increased first and then decreased, and fluorene decreased from 0.71% to 0.39%. The hydrogenation, condensation and polymerization between aromatic free radical skeletons or fragments would occur under the influence of H+ radical, which resulted in the increase of PAHs content when the hydrogen content below 10% in this investigation. However, tricyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other large molecular PAHs tended to convert to PAHs with small molecular weight with the hydrogen content continued to increase."
10,Conclusion,"In this investigation, the pyrolytic products yield, gas and bio-oil composition in volatiles affected by operating parameters during fast pyrolysis of food waste in the presence of H2 were studied. The pyrolysis experiments were carried out on a lab-scale downdraft tube reactor, and the main conclusions can be summarized as follow: i) The pyrolysis final temperature had a significant effect on the three-phase yield, which can obviously improve the gas yield to 61.76% at 900 °C. In the composition of gaseous product, the molar content of H2, CH4 and CO increased with temperature, whereas that of CO2 decreased. The aromatic and N-heterocycle in tar also increased while phenol decreased when temperature increased. ii) The faster flow rate resulted in a shorter residence time which will gradually reduce the bio-oil and char yield, but gaseous products decreased from 78.72% to 54.69%. It can be inferred that the effect of carrier gas flow rate on gas quality and bio-oil composition did not seem to be a critical parameter. iii) Pyrolysis in the presence of different concentrations of H2 in carrier gas did not significantly change the yield of three-phase products. However, the H2, CH4 and LHV values of gaseous products were reached to 29.18%, 12.68% and 14.90 MJ Nm−3 under 10% hydrogen. From the composition and distribution of bio-oil, it can be found that hydrogen in carrier gas promoted phenols and inhibited N-heterocycle production.
