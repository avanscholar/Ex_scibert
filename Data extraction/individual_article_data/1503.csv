0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is among the most valuable gases in chemical engineering and energy industry. It has been thoroughly investigated for energy generation due to its high specific energy. When it is oxidised, it releases high energy with only water formed as a by-product [1]. Besides energy generation, H2 also has been used to improve the quality of gasoline products in refineries. Hydrogen reportedly also showed hydrogen-induced protective effects on a rat model of cerebral infraction [2]. Hence, the gas not only finds its use in fuel cells and refineries, but it also has the potential that can be exploited for medical therapeutic. Because of the versatility of the gas, demands for hydrogen continues to increase in many industries such as fuel cells, semiconductor processing, petrochemical, and medicine. Steam methane reforming, coke oven gas, and coal gasification are mature technologies for large scale hydrogen production. Alternative technologies are also being proposed for hydrogen production including biomass gasification, water electrolysis, and nuclear energy [3–6]. In 2019, up to 70 Mt of hydrogen was produced, comprising 76% from natural gas, 23% from coal, and the rest from other technologies [7]. Steam methane reforming (SMR) has been dominating the world for decades to cater to the increasing demand by these industries. SMR is a catalytic process that involves a reaction between natural gas or other light hydrocarbons and steam. The advantages of SMR for hydrogen production are no oxygen consumption, high efficiency, and low operational and production costs [8]. The products from SMR are mostly hydrogen, carbon dioxide (CO2) and traces of carbon monoxide and unreacted methane. Thus, produced hydrogen needs to be purified further before it can be safely used either for human consumption or as fuel for electricity generation. There are reports on CO2 capture [9–11], recovering H2 from SMR product stream [12] and recovering methane from natural gas [13] using pressure swing adsorption (PSA). PSA is a cyclic process that selectively adsorbs and separates the gas components by pressure change, producing purified gas species (hydrogen) in the product stream and enriched the other gas species (carbon dioxide) in the other stream [11]. PSA is favourable due to its lower energy requirements, efficacy, and proven technology [14]. The basic configuration procedures in PSA comprises pressurisation, adsorption, depressurisation, and blowdown steps [10,15]. The PSA process's performance is evaluated by the gases’ purity and recovery [12,16], but the heart of the process actually comes from the adsorbents [2]. Many adsorbents have been developed for PSA. Small pellets, beads, or granules are common adsorbent forms. The main criteria for sorbent selection are high specific surface area, high selectivity, and high regeneration ability [10]. Different types of solid adsorbents like silica gel, activated alumina, molecular sieve zeolites, synthetic polymers or resin, and activated carbon have different characteristics. Thus, they perform differently under similar industrial settings. Activated carbon produced from non-conventional waste materials from industry and agriculture such as waste apricot, rubber seed coat, coconut husk, apricot shell, rice straw, corncob, bamboo, sawdust, and sunflower seeds are well received due to their renewability and cost-effectiveness for PSA applications [17]. Activated carbons are being the subject of growing research due to the thermal and chemical stability, exceptional thermal conductivity, and meso/microporous structures [18]. The conspicuous characteristic of the activated carbon over the other materials is the readily available biomass precursor at low cost, making it more sustainable. Like the other renewable biomasses, palm kernel shells are also reportedly used in the past [19,20]. Palm kernel shells not only exhibit favourable porous surface, chemical stability, mechanical strength, insolubility in water, and low moisture content [19,20], they are also present in abundance in Malaysia. In 2019, it is reported that Malaysia has exported 18.47 million metric tonnes of palm oil [21]. Aside from adsorbent improvement, PSA engineering is another important area that can be exploited to boost the gas purification performance. The adiabatic cylindrical columns, which are commonly used in the PSA, do not recuperate the heat energy effectively from the adsorption–desorption processes, resulting in waste of the energy to the surrounding. The heat accumulation, if remained in the bed, tends to degrade the gas adsorption capability. Allowing the heat that is generated from adsorption to flow into another bed undergoing desorption non-adiabatically may improve the recovery of the adsorbate [22]. The objective of this work was to evaluate the performance of a non-adiabatic plate PSA mediated by palm kernel shell activated carbon for hydrogen purification from steam methane reforming. The non-adiabatic plate PSA proposed in this research is different from the conventional PSA that uses two cylindrical columns in that, the latter prevents heat exchange from taking place between the columns (adiabatic PSA). Plate PSA on the other hand, allows heat to transfer between adsorbent beds so that the respective cooling and heating can occur simultaneously. The non-adiabatic plate PSA is used to study the effect of adsorption and desorption during blowdown time on the purity and recovery of the gases."
1,Methodology,
2,Adsorbent preparation from palm kernel shell,"2.1 Adsorbent preparation from palm kernel shell Samples of palm kernel shell (PKS) waste from a local oil palm estate was collected, washed and dried. The sample was immersed in zinc chloride (Merck, Germany with purity of 98%) solution with a ratio of 1:1 per mass basis. ZnCl2 is usually used as an activation agent for biomass carbon activation to obtain high reactivity, high surface area and carbon yield as reported previously [23,24]. It is important to notice that while applying low amount of ZnCl2 enhances microporosity, high ZnCl2 amount on the other hand, results in increasing pore diameter [18]. The sample was kept for 24 h before it was dried and placed into a furnace (GSL-1100X, MTI Corporation). The sample was initially heated to 300 °C under nitrogen flow of 15 mL/min, and the temperature was kept constant for 0.5 h then heated from 300 °C to 800 °C under 15 mL/min nitrogen flow and kept constant at this temperature for 0.5 h. The sample was cooled to room temperature slowly. The sample was chemically activated by immersing and stirring in potassium hydroxide (Merck, Germany with purity of ≥ 90%), KOH solution at a 1:1 ratio by weight [12,25]. Three carbon activation pathways using KOH can occur as follows [26,27] i) engraving the carbon structure by redox reactions between carbon surface and KOH. This action is called chemical activation which is responsible for the formation of pore network, ii) water and carbon dioxide production through physical activation enhances the surface porosity by gasification of the carbon, iii) interaction of the released K ions in the carbon lattices causes expansion of the carbon lattices. The adsorbent sample was then removed from the solution, washed with distilled water for several times until the pH became neutral and dried in an oven at 110 °C for 3 h prior to use. The activated carbon (AC) sample is now termed as PKS-AC."
3,Characterisation of adsorbent,"2.2 Characterisation of adsorbent The adsorbent sample was characterized using several techniques. Pulse chemisorption (PC) was performed by exposing the adsorbent to a gas comprising 15% CO2 concentration (15% CO2 diluted in He) at 1 pulse/2 mins, 20 pulses until saturated. Mass spectrometry unit attached to a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 V3.05 Chemisorp analyzer was used to measure CO2 desorption automatically. In temperature program desorption (TPD) analysis, pure CO2 (100% CO2) was used at 50 mL/min for 1 h under a constant flow of helium. A Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to capture the adsorbent sample's microstructural images to analyze its surface morphology with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDX). SEM model type Quanta FEG450 was used to serve the purposes. The sample was put on carbon tape on an aluminum stub coated with gold for electron reflection. Then, the sample was vacuumed for 5 to 10 min prior to the analysis. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) was used to analyze the surface area, pore-volume, and size of the adsorbent sample. The PKS-AC sample was degassed under vacuum conditions for about 6 to 8 h at 300˚C prior to the analysis. The BET analyzer provided the total surface area and average pore size distribution with the help of ASAP 2020 software. Using X-ray diffraction (XRD), the sample's crystalline nature and metal oxide phases were identified. The XRD pattern was then collected using Cu-Kαl radiations (1.5405 Å) at a voltage and current of 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. The scanning speed was performed at 0.02˚ step at the rate of 1 s/step."
4,Single plate column breakthrough,"2.3 Single plate column breakthrough The breakthrough study was important to understand the adsorbent capacity in adsorbing and desorbing the gases. From the breakthrough curves, information regarding suitable adsorption and blowdown time limits would be obtained. The study was conducted using only one side of the plate. Argon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide gases were used. They were obtained from Well Gas company with purity of 99.99%. The adsorbent was flushed with argon at a rate of 10 mL/min in an oven up to 100 ˚C for 20 min to remove all impurities that might attach to the adsorbent's pores and interstices prior to use. A binary gas mixture containing 85 vol% hydrogen and 15 vol% carbon dioxide was introduced in the feed stream to represent the SMR product gas [12]. This gas was pressurised into the plate column up to 2 bars. Agilent gas chromatography (GC) was used to analyse the gas composition that broke through the adsorbent and flowed into the outlet stream (purified hydrogen stream). The concentration ratio of the gas sample in the outlet stream to that in the feed was recorded. From the measured concentration ratios, breakthrough curves of the concentration ratio as a function of adsorption time were plotted and analysed to determine the suitable adsorption and blowdown time for PSA operation."
5,PSA operation,"2.4 PSA operation Fig. 1 depicts the PSA process flow diagram during pressure swing operation and the plate cells that accommodated the adsorbents. The PSA employed in this study was the basic 4 steps pressure swing cycle. First, plate column 2 was pressurised by supplying the gas mixture of 85 vol% H2 and 15 vol% CO2 into the cell until a pressure of 2 bars was reached. At the same time, plate column 1 was depressurised during a process called a blowdown step to remove all possible gases remaining in the adsorbent bed. Second, the adsorption process was maintained for 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 min, respectively at 2 bars, after which the feed was stopped. Gas samples of the purified hydrogen leaving the adsorbent bed into the T400 collection tank was taken for analysis. Third, the plate column 2 was depressurised until 1 bar was reached. Finally, the adsorbed CO2 was removed from the bed during a blowdown step for 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 min, respectively. Gas samples of the released carbon dioxide from the adsorbent bed into the T500 collection tank was taken for analysis. The processes occurred simultaneously in plate column 1 but in reversed orders starting from blowdown, i.e., removal of the gases from the bed in column 1, depressurisation, desorption, and pressurisation to complete the cycle [12,25,28]. The process was repeated for 5 cycles. The non-adiabatic PSA performance is gauged by the purity and recovery of the gases. Purity and recovery signify product quality and removal efficiency. The purity and recovery of H2 and CO2 are defined respectively as follows [14,29]: (1) H 2 p u r i t y = Amount of H 2 i n e n r i c h e d H 2 s t r e a m Amount of H 2 a n d C O 2 i n H 2 e n r i c h e d s t r e a m (2) H 2 r e c o v e r y = Amount of H 2 i n H 2 e n r i c h e d s t r e a m Amount of H 2 i n f e e d s t r e a m (3) CO 2 p u r i t y = Amount of CO 2 i n e n r i c h e d CO 2 s t r e a m Amount of H 2 a n d C O 2 i n CO 2 e n r i c h e d s t r e a m (4) CO 2 r e c o v e r y = Amount of CO 2 i n CO 2 e n r i c h e d s t r e a m Amount of CO 2 i n f e e d s t r e a m"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterizations results,"3.1 Characterizations results Table 2 shows the pore characteristics of the PKS adsorbent. The surface area calculated by using multi-point BET was lower than that calculated using Langmuir monolayer but higher than that calculated using the v-t method. Generally, the surface area was within the commercial adsorbent of 500–1500 m2/g. The adsorbent was considered a microporous material based on the pore size of the adsorbent of ≤ 2 nm. Fig. 2 depicts the N2 adsorption isotherms of the adsorbent. The adsorption isotherm shown was of type I without hysteresis, suggesting that the sample was indeed a microporous material which is consistent with the pore size of ≤ 2 nm presented in Table 1. Introduction of microporous structure with narrow pores results in an overlapping potential field of the adjacent pore walls that could correspondingly elevates the characteristic energyof adsorption [30]. It is well-known that an increase in the adsorption energy is inconsiderable for the pore size higher than three/four times the kinetic diameter of CO2 for cylindrical pores. From this perspective, the optimized pore size to attain maximum CO2 uptake capacity should be less than 2 nm, since CO2 molecule diameter is 0.33 nm [18]. Fig. 3 shows SEM micrographs of the PKS-AC sample at magnifications of 40 K to show the existence of the open pore structures [16] to accommodate the gas. The current sample displayed porous structures of irregular amorphous carbon sheets with an open-pore geometry, typically observed in other activated carbon samples originated from biomasses [31–36]. PKS-AC displayed dense exfoliating folds with coarse surfaces providing edges with uniformed pores and channels, resembling the commercial activated carbon. Additionally, a more distinctive surface with a porous structure was observed on the activated PKS-AC sample after the activation processes. The impregnation of ZnCl2 and KOH by chemical activation during the synthesis resulted in a stable carbon bulk with networked pores, which is consistent with the previous observation that confirmed the broadening of pore diameters with the creation of new pores after carbonaceous samples were chemically activated [37]. Fig. 4 depicts the energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) analysis of PKS-AC. The carbonisation of PKS-AC yielded a substantially high carbon content of up to 83 wt%, leaving the remaining parts as oxygen in the oxide form and traces of potassium and zinc [25,38]. Silica and iron residues were also observed from the analysis. The presence of these metal elements could potentially improve the affinity of the adsorbent for carbon dioxide by facilitating the formation of microporosity on the carbon surface [39]. Also, metal elements can directly react with CO2 molecules to produce metal carbonates. Fig. 5 depicts the FT-IR spectra of PKS-AC. A weak absorption with the broadband around 3200–3600 cm−1 was related to bonded O–H broadening in alcohols and adsorbed water. The wavenumber at 1639 cm−1 was attributed to the C = C aromatics group, whereas the weak band at 607.6 and 1396 cm−1 were attributed to the C–C and C-O vibrations, respectively [40]. The metal species found in the sample were not bonded to carbon directly but existed as separate entities as observed from the SEM images. We anticipated that the metal species not bounded with the carbon molecules would provide more surface exposure to the adsorbate during PSA operation in order to facilitate the capture of the adsorbate. Fig. 6 depicts the XRD patterns of the PKS sample. The broad diffraction peaks located at 2θ = 5-15°, 20-30° and 40-60° revealed the presence of silica phase, amorphous carbon, and iron, which is consistent with the findings from EDX analysis discussed previously [41,42]. Three sharp peaks observed at 2θ = 31.3°, 33.8° and 36.1° were due to the Zn and K species that were used as a chemical activation agent during synthesis [43]. Silica species was observed at 2θ = 9.86°, 13.52° and 14.73° whereas, iron species was detected at 2θ = 42.4°, 44.8°, 58.2°. The broad XRD spectrum suggests that the adsorbent was an amorphous material having neither a specific crystalline structure nor particle geometry, which was confirmed from the earlier SEM images. Fig. 7 depicts desorption peaks in CO2-pulse chemisorption (CO2-PC) for PKS-AC before it was fully saturated to study the adsorbent's reversibility. The thermal conductivity detector (TCD) signal gave consistent readings for 8 consecutive desorption peaks with cumulative CO2 adsorption of 256.38 cm3/g STP, suggesting that the adsorbent would be able to regenerate sustainably after it was saturated."
8,Non-adiabatic PSA performance,"3.2 Non-adiabatic PSA performance Fig. 8 shows the breakthrough curves of the prepared activated palm kernel shell adsorbent for 85 vol% hydrogen and 15 vol% carbon dioxide respectively, making the total volumetric flow of the binary mixture into the adsorbent equivalent to 100 mL/min. The two distinct curves depict that the adsorbent captured CO2 more effectively than H2, despite the lower flow rate of the former adsorbate. The adsorbent retained CO2 longer in the adsorbent bed than H2. H2 showed a much shorter breakthrough time of about 3 min than the CO2. The latter gas showed a longer breakthrough time of approximately 20 min. Hydrogen started to saturate at about 12 min, whereas carbon dioxide exhibited a longer saturated time of 48 min. Thus, adsorption time for pressure swing operation should be taken between 0 and 12 min. However, pure H2 was observed to flow into the collection tank after 3 min of the adsorption. Following this revelation, we decided to use the adsorption time of 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 min, respectively, for the next PSA operation in order to study the adsorption effects on the purity and recovery of the gases. The adsorption time was selected since it is less than 6 min breakthrough time of H2. Blowdown time (the time required to draw or desorb the captured gases from the plate column) of 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 min, which is similar to the adsorption time, was used in order to study the desorption effects on purity and recovery of the gases. Fig. 9 shows the effects of adsorption time on the purity and recovery of hydrogen from plate 1 (front column) and plate 2 (rear column). Blowdown time was fixed at 0.5 min. The gas sample was taken from the sampling point located before the T400 collection tank (Fig. 1). The purity of hydrogen generally increased with an increase in the adsorption time for both plate columns. As anticipated from the earlier breakthrough analysis, adsorption time greater than or equivalent to 3 min would produce the highest purity and recovery of hydrogen from both columns. However, column 2 is observed to perform slightly better than column 1 during PSA operation, possibly due to slightly better packing arrangement of the adsorbent grains in the former bed column, despite both having an equal packing density of about 0.3 g.cm 3. Adsorption time of 3 min (from plate column 2) yielded the highest hydrogen purity of 97.5% (recovery of 98.7%), whereas 5 min adsorption time gave the highest hydrogen recovery of 99.3% (purity of 92.5%). The reason for higher H2 purity at shorter adsorption time (3 min) was due to the CO2 that was completely trapped in the adsorbent bed. At a longer adsorption time of 5 min however, the bed was partially saturated and some of the CO2 successfully escaped together with H2, causing a drop in the H2 purity [28,44–45]. The increased recovery at increasing adsorption time was due to sufficient time for most of the H2 in the adsorbent beds to exit from the beds and flowed into the collection tank. It was reported previously that the highest hydrogen purity of almost 100% (recovery of 88.4%) at 5 min adsorption was obtained using cylindrical columns [12]. In contrast to the cylindrical column adiabatic PSA that reportedly improved hydrogen purity at decreasing recovery as adsorption time was increased [12], plate column non-adiabatic PSA from this work shows that hydrogen recovery could be improved by increasing the adsorption time (at the expense of decreasing purity). This further demonstrates that a trade-off between purity and recovery existed in adiabatic and non-adiabatic PSA, in which higher recovery could be achieved at the expense of decreasing purity and vice-versa. Adsorption time played a significant role in affecting the purity and recovery of hydrogen. Fig. 10 shows the effects of adsorption time on the purity and recovery of carbon dioxide from plate 1 (front column) and plate 2 (rear column). The gas sample was taken from the sampling point located immediately after the P100 vacuum pump before the gas reached the T500 collection tank (Fig. 1). The purity of carbon dioxide did not follow a specific pattern, but column 1 is seen to improve the gas purity slightly to 22% above the purity of the gas originally in the feed of 15%. The highest carbon dioxide recovery of 49% was obtained at the highest purity of 22% when 1 min adsorption time was used. Lowering the adsorption time to 0.5 min or increasing the adsorption time from 3 to 5 min would only reduce both purity and recovery of carbon dioxide. The relationship between adsorption time and carbon dioxide purity-recovery could not be established firmly. This is perhaps, due to the hydrogen being captured together in the adsorbent bed that eventually mixed with the captured carbon dioxide as they were drawn together during desorption. The hydrogen on release during desorption mixed and contaminated the carbon dioxide product. Fig. 11 compares the hydrogen purity from non-adiabatic PSA operations between the two plate columns. The adsorption time was fixed at 3 min because it was found to yield the highest hydrogen purity of 97.5%, as discussed previously. Column 2 outperformed column 1 at 0.5 min blowdown time initially, but both columns performed equally at 1 min blowdown, and then column 1 surpassed column 2 slightly at 3 min blowdown time until they both almost equalised at 5 min blowdown time. Generally, the hydrogen purity did not change much at increasing blowdown time. The hydrogen purity hovered around 95–98% at increasing blowdown time from 0.5 to 5 min. Blowdown time also did not affect the purity and recovery significantly. The differences were shown in an exploded view by expanding the recovery scale from 90 to 100% to ease the comparison. However, the graph suggests that an extended blowdown time to 5 min would lead both columns to converge into common hydrogen purity and recovery values. Fig. 12 depicts the carbon dioxide purity and recovery from non-adiabatic PSA operations between the two plate columns. Like hydrogen purity and recovery, carbon dioxide purity and recovery appeared to converge into common carbon dioxide purity and recovery values if the blowdown time was extended to 5 min. Here, the trade-off between purity and recovery was more pronounced at increasing blowdown time. While carbon dioxide purity was not improved (remained at 15%), carbon dioxide recovery was commendably high at 82% when a longer blowdown time of 5 min was used. The increased recovery at increasing blowdown time was possible because there was sufficient time for most of the retained carbon dioxide in the adsorbent beds to be desorbed from the beds. The declining carbon dioxide purity at increasing blowdown time, however, could be due to the accumulation of hydrogen in the adsorbent bed that contaminated the carbon dioxide product upon release during desorption. This is our first initiative involving non-adiabatic PSA in the effort to increase the recovery of H2. Although the results are promising, there was a compromise at the expense of purity degradation. This purity-recovery trade-off could be resolved by optimizing the operating conditions of PSA in order to achieve the optimum levels of hydrogen purity and recovery. There are many optimization techniques that are available. For example, the optimization by response surface analysis that has been increasingly popular can be used. A more advanced optimization technique such as artificial neural network that can describe a more complex phenomenon is also attractive for the H2 purification process. Extreme learning machine coupled with radial basis function neural networks is another robust optimization technique which may be explored to optimize the non-adiabatic PSA process parameters."
9,Conclusion,"3.3 Conclusion An amorphous microporous activated carbon prepared from palm kernel shell produced a highly porous structure that exhibited high specific surface area and wide range of particle size distributions. These characteristics are necessary for an efficient gas separation using PSA. A two bed non-adiabatic plate PSA system mediated by microporous palm kernel shell activated carbon was found to improve the hydrogen recovery by increasing the adsorption time. However, the improved hydrogen recovery was achieved at the expense of reduced hydrogen purity. The highest hydrogen purity of 97.5% (recovery of 98.7%) was obtained at 3 min adsorption time, whereas the highest hydrogen recovery of 99.3% (purity of 92.5%) was achieved at 5 min adsorption time. Although blowdown time did not affect the purity and recovery of hydrogen significantly, it demonstrated quite a revealing trade-off between purity and recovery of carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide purity was low due to the increasing hydrogen contamination. The carbon dioxide recovery was high due to the sufficient time for most of the retained carbon dioxide in the adsorbent beds to be released from the adsorbent beds.
