0,Introduction,"In the field of heterogeneous catalysis, catalyst supports not only allow the efficient dispersion of catalytically active phases and the significant enrichment of surface active sites, but also enable the construction of diverse low-coordinated or interfacial sites to exhibit distinct catalytic behavior governed by specific chemical and physical states. The support effects are usually demonstrated to arise from metal cluster or nanoparticle stabilization, mutual charge transfer, and synergetic participation of catalytic sites located on support in catalysis. However, the exact nature of metal–support interactions controlling activity, selectivity, and stability of supported metal catalysts remains unclear. The challenging chemoselective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to produce unsaturated alcohols is of great fundamental and industrial significance. Using proper catalyst supports (TiO2, SiO2, CeO2, ZnO, etc.) to construct metal (Pt, Ag, Au, Ir, etc.) catalysts has proven to be the key to driving CO bond hydrogenation to surpass the thermodynamically favored hydrogenation of the CC bond [1–16]. Among the metals catalytically active for hydrogenation, Ag, although usually displaying relatively poor hydrogenation activity due to its low affinity and activation force for dihydrogen, displays high intrinsic capability to produce unsaturated alcohols with remarkably high intramolecular selectivity in heterogeneous chemoselective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes (acrolein and crotonaldehyde) [9,17–20]. Differently from effective Pt-based catalysts supported on reducible oxides such as TiO2 and CeO2 [2,21,22], Ag catalysts display better unsaturated alcohol selectivity on nonreducible oxide (SiO2, Al2O3, and ZnO). The O-vacancy sites on the Pt/TiO2 surface help to activate the CO bond of crotonaldehyde and form an intermediate to react with the spillover H provided by the Pt to produce crotyl alcohol. In contrast, Pt/SiO2 displayed poor performance as a result of the inactive role of SiO2 [22]. Claus et al. compared the performance of monometallic Ag catalysts supported on TiO2 and SiO2 in crotonaldehyde hydrogenation [18]. Ag/TiO2-LTR reduced at a low temperature of 473 K displayed a selectivity for crotyl alcohol of 53%, which was much higher than that obtained on Ag/TiO2-HTR reduced at a high temperature of 773 K (28%). An antipathetic Ag particle size effect was observed, as Ag/TiO2-HTR with a smaller Ag particle size of 1.4 ± 0.5 nm possessed lower hydrogenation activity than Ag/TiO2-LTR with a larger Ag particle size of 2.8 ± 1.9 nm. In contrast, Ag/SiO2 catalysts from different preparation methods including sol–gel, impregnation, and precipitation–deposition showed comparable crotyl alcohol selectivity of 59 ± 3% in spite of their differences in Ag particle size, presenting structure-insensitive catalysis. For the difficult chemoselective hydrogenation of acrolein, which is the simplest α,β-unsaturated aldehyde without a substituent at the CC group, monometallic Ag/SiO2, Ag/Al2O3, and Ag/ZnO showed an order of maximum allyl alcohol selectivity of Ag/SiO2 (39%) < Ag/Al2O3 (42%) and Ag/ZnO (50%), reflecting the marked influence of oxide supports [23]. A small Ag particle size effect was also revealed in acrolein hydrogenation. Ag/SiO2 from incipient wetness with a small average particle size of 2.5 nm displayed a turnover frequency comparable to that of Ag/SiO2 from precipitation–deposition with bigger Ag particles (14.2 nm), while the former showed somewhat higher allyl alcohol selectivity [23]. An adsorption geometry of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes on surface catalytic sites is generally proposed for interpreting the selectivity patterns. To date, the exact location and structure of effective catalytic sites on Ag-based catalysts for the chemisorption and activation of the CC and CO bonds of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and dihydrogen remain unclear and highly controversial. Facet sites, low-coordination sites such as kinks or edges, and interfacial sites on the boundaries of Ag particles and supports have all been suggested as possible catalytic sites. Meyer and co-workers found that the selectivity to allyl alcohol in Ag/SiO2-catalyzed acrolein hydrogenation went up with increasing Ag particle size from 1 to 9 nm and supposed that the Ag(1 1 1) sites were likely responsible for the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond according to the variation of different surface sites with metal particle size [15]. Theoretical study also predicted that high-coordination-number sites over Ag(1 1 1) possess higher selectivity for propanol than low-coordination-number sites [24]. However, periodic density-functional calculations by Lim et al. showed that on clear and regular Ag(1 1 1) surfaces, acrolein is very weakly adsorbed, and the probability of Ag(1 1 1) being responsible for the preferential activation of CO bonds is very low. Further, the flat Ag(1 1 0) and stepped Ag(2 2 1) surfaces also interact very weakly with acrolein and provide very limited bond activation. Therefore, the authors concluded that morphological defect sites composing low-coordinated Ag atoms are responsible for the formation of allyl alcohol [25]. Claus et al. ascribed the high selectivity to crotyl alcohol over the Ag–Mn/SiO2 and Ag–La/SiO2 catalysts to the formation of interfacial sites consisting of accessible lower-valent metal cations or oxygen vacancies on the matrix adjacent to Ag sites, which can induce interaction with the free electron pair of the oxygen atom of the CO bond. Another density-functional study by Lim et al. suggested that the clean Ag(1 1 0) surface formed undesired saturated aldehyde as the main product, but the surface Osub/Ag(1 1 1) with subsurface oxygen centers favored the formation of unsaturated alcohol [26]. Experimentally, a profound influence of oxygen treatment on activity and selectivity was observed on the Ag/ZnO and Ag/SiO2 catalysts for acrolein hydrogenation [2]. Oxygen treatment significantly enhanced the allyl alcohol selectivity of Ag/ZnO, but subsequent hydrogen treatment only slightly decreased the allyl alcohol selectivity, suggesting the importance of subsurface oxygen. Introducing a small amount of air into the reaction mixture was observed to promote allyl alcohol selectivity to a high level of 42% on Ag/SiO2 catalyst. These facts stress that constructing electropositive or polar Ag sites favoring the coordination of the CO bond is crucial for obtaining high production efficiency for unsaturated alcohols. For real catalysts, constructing effective Ag catalytic sites through the relatively stable interaction between Ag atoms and neighboring oxygens from oxide supports or additives may be more practical than simply inserting mobile oxygen into Ag ensembles by high-temperature calcination. An interesting pressure dependence of product distribution in gas-phase hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes was observed, and the change of adsorption geometry induced by different substrate surface coverage was assumed to be the main cause [27,28]. Claus et al. found that the threshold pressure for allyl alcohol formation was about 100 mbar, and the increase of reaction pressure from 2 mbar to 20 bar led to a significant increase of allyl alcohol selectivity from 0% to 42% on Ag/SiO2 [18,23]. Lambert et al. reported that on the Ag(1 1 1) surface, high acrolein coverage forces the CC bonds to tilt markedly and renders them less vulnerable to hydrogenation [10]. In addition, competitive adsorption among various surface species including hydrogen, intermediates, and deposits also influences the product distribution. A study of acrolein hydrogenation on Ag/SiO2 revealed that increasing partial pressures of acrolein and/or hydrogen from 50 mbar to 20 bar all led to increasing selectivity for allyl alcohol [23]. Similarly, our previous investigation of bimetallic AuAg/SBA-15 catalysts showed that under a constant reaction pressure of 3.0 MPa, increasing the ratio of hydrogen to crotonaldehyde brought about an increase in crotyl alcohol selectivity [29]. The observed sensitivity of selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes mainly arises from the activation of polar CO bonds and nonpolar CC bonds and the subsequent hydrogenation with surface hydrogen species occurring on different catalytic sites. Rapid evolution of catalytic behavior in the initial stage of catalytic operation and catalyst deactivation or instability are frequently observed in the gas-phase hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. Pt- or Rh-based catalysts commonly undergo rapid deactivation during the first several hours on stream and then step into the steady state with a relatively low deactivation rate [1,30]. However, few reports on catalytic performance evolution of Ag-based catalysts in gas-phase hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes have been available so far. Strong time dependence of activity and selectivity was reported in low-pressure acrolein hydrogenation on the Ag/SiO2 [23]. At a reaction pressure of 266 mbar, an induction period of 9 min for allyl alcohol formation was instantly followed by a decrease in allyl alcohol selectivity within a short reaction time of 20 min. Empirically, it should be realized that the morphology and size of Ag aggregates, the chemical state of Ag species, and the interaction and interfacial structure between Ag crystallites and supports or additives may change dynamically under real reaction conditions, resulting in the induction, deactivation, or variation of Ag catalysts. With the goal of developing practical Ag-based catalysts, catalytic stability is a feature as important as activity and unsaturated alcohol selectivity. Here, we report an efficient approach involving surface modification by zirconia doping on silica to construct a kind of supported Ag catalyst displaying enhanced hydrogenation ability for the aldehyde group and improved long-term catalytic stability in the gas phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. Zirconia has moderate acidity and basicity as well as reducing and oxidizing properties and can easily combine with silica to form an oxide composite with enhanced surface polarity [31,32], which may favor the stabilization of Ag aggregates and the creation of polar Ag catalytic sites. With the aim of studying the correlation of catalytic behavior and catalyst microstructure, the performance of a series of Ag/SiO2 and Ag/Zr-SiO2 catalysts with different Ag loading and zirconia content was evaluated in the fixed-bed mode and kinetics under steady-state conditions was studied. The physicochemical properties of catalysts were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), nitrogen physisorption, oxygen chemisorption, H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2 TPR), and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). Furthermore, the evolution of hydrogenation behavior on Ag/SiO2 and Ag/Zr-SiO2 in a long catalytic operation was monitored and the possible reasons for catalyst induction and deactivation are discussed."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals and reagents,"2.1 Chemicals and reagents Silver nitrate (AgNO3), zirconyl nitrate (ZrO(NO3)2), crotonaldehyde, SiO2, and ZrO2 were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagents (Shanghai, China). High-purity Ag and Ag2O powders were provided by Aladdin Industrial Corporation (Shanghai, China)."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation Zirconia-doped silica supports (Zr–SiO2) were synthesized by impregnating commercial silica spheres (40–60 mesh, specific surface area 278 m2/g) with an aqueous solution of ZrO(NO3)2. The mixture was subjected to aging at room temperature for 24 h. The obtained powders were dried at 353 K for 12 h and then calcined at 623 K for 3 h to yield the Zr–SiO2 supports. Ag/SiO2 and Ag/Zr–SiO2 catalysts were prepared using the method of incipient wetness impregnation. The dry support was mixed with an aqueous solution of AgNO3 and the mixture was aged at room temperature for 24 h in the dark. Calcination at 573 K for 3 h was performed after drying at 353 K for 12 h. The yielded sample was denoted as XAg/SiO2 or XAg/YZr-SiO2 (X = Ag loading in weight percentage and Y = zirconia content in weight percentage)."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were acquired at 77.3 K on a Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 porosimetry analyzer. All samples were degassed at 373 K for 4 h prior to the N2 physisorption measurements. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was used to calculate the specific surface area. The pore volumes and pore distributions were derived using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. TEM images were recorded on an FEI Tecnai 30 electron microscope operated at 300 kV. Prior to the TEM measurement, the reduced catalyst powders were ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol for 30 min and then dripped onto copper grids. At least 200 Ag particles were measured to calculate the average Ag particle size for each sample. XRD patterns were recorded on a PANalytical X’pert Pro Super X-ray diffractometer using CuKα radiation (35 kV, 20 mA, λ = 0.15418 nm). The full width at half maximum of the XRD peak at 2θ = 38.2° for Ag(1 1 1) was adopted to calculate the average size of Ag crystallites using Scherrer’s equation. The H2 TPR profiles were recorded on a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 instrument. After a 0.1-g sample was pretreated in 5% O2/Ar at 373 K for 1 h, the temperature was ramped from 300 to 1073 K at 10 K/min in a flow of 5% H2/Ar. A thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to monitor the variation of H2 concentration in the effluent gas from a cold trap for removing moisture. The quantitative analysis of reducible species on catalyst precursors was also performed by calibrating the TPR peak area with 15 mg high-purity Cu2O powders. The measurement of the ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3 TPD) was performed on the same instrument. A Hiden Qic-20 mass spectrometer was used to detect the desorbed ammonia with the signals of m/e = 16 and 17 in multiple ion detection mode. Prior to the temperature ramping at a rate of 10 K/min from 373 K to 1073 K in a flow of He, a 0.1-g sample was reduced by hydrogen at 473 K for 2 h and then saturated with ammonia in a flow of 10% NH3/Ar at 373 K for 1 h. The dynamic measurement of O2 chemisorption on catalysts was performed with the pulse-injection technique on a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 instrument with a TCD. An adequate sample (0.5–2.0 g) was reduced by hydrogen at 473 K for 2 h and then the temperature was ramped to 323 K in a stream of high-purity He. A loop with a volume of 1.0 ml was used to introduce 5% O2/He to the reduced sample until the adsorption was saturated. Characterization by XPS and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) was conducted on a Quantum 2000 Scanning ESCA Microprob spectrometer equipped with an AlKα X-ray radiation source (hν = 1486.6 eV) operated at 20 mA and 15 kV. The binding energy was calibrated with the peak of Si2p at 103.4 eV characteristic of SiO2. Reduction treatment with hydrogen on Ag catalysts was conducted in a glove box and the reduced sample was transferred to an XPS analysis warehouse without exposure to air."
5,Catalytic evaluation and kinetic measurements,"2.4 Catalytic evaluation and kinetic measurements Gas-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde was evaluated in a fixed-bed microreactor in continuous downflow mode. For each catalytic evaluation, 250 mg of catalyst was loaded into a quartz tubular reactor (inner diameter 7 mm) and the top side of the catalyst bed was packed with 5.0 g of quartz grains. Prior to the catalytic hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, the catalyst sample was prereduced in a flow of H2 at a rate of 50 ml/min at 473 K for 1 h and then cooled to the reaction temperature. Crotonaldehyde vapor supplied from a bubbling generator at 273 K or higher temperatures was carried by the H2 stream into the catalyst bed. The outlet gas was collected by an online six-way sampling valve (Vici Valco) and analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (GC-2010, Shimadzu) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a capillary column (DB-WAX, 30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.5 μm). Steady-state kinetic studies were carried out in the same equipment on catalysts with quasi-steady activity after 12 h of catalytic hydrogenation. The crotonaldehyde conversion was kept below 15% to analyze the data in a differential reactor mode. The total space velocity was increased to 16,800 ml/h g-cat and the absence of heat and mass transfer limitations was confirmed. Helium was used as a balance gas and the partial pressure of crotonaldehyde was kept at 0.87 kPa in studying the effect of hydrogen partial pressure. To minimize the influence of catalyst deactivation, all catalytic data were collected in no longer than 7 min. Therefore, five-point kinetic measurement for the influence of factors including temperature, H2, and crotonaldehyde partial pressure can be finished in 24 min."

7,Catalytic behavior of crotonaldehyde hydrogenation,"3.1 Catalytic behavior of crotonaldehyde hydrogenation 3.1.1 Catalytic behavior of Ag/SiO2 and Ag/Zr–SiO2 The catalytic behaviors of silica-supported monometallic Ag catalysts from different preparation methods in the vapor-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde have been investigated under a relatively high reaction pressure (2.0 MPa) [33], but a detailed report on the influence of Ag loading on catalytic performance is still unavailable for monometallic Ag/SiO2. Table 1 lists the catalytic data of a series of Ag/SiO2 prepared by incipient wetness impregnation with Ag loading ranging from 0.5 to 30 wt%. Apparently, the conversion of crotonaldehyde increases with the increase of Ag loading due to the upsurge of Ag active sites at a fixed catalyst dosage (0.25 g). Under atmospheric pressure and at 373 K, the Ag/SiO2 catalysts with Ag loading ≥5 wt% produced crotyl alcohol from CO bond hydrogenation as the main product with a selectivity range of 64–71%, which is in agreement with the results in the literature [33]. Decreasing the Ag loading to a low level brought about a negative effect on CO bond hydrogenation. The highest selectivity to undesired butanal from CC bond hydrogenation and increased production of hydrocarbons from hydrogenolysis were observed on the 0.5Ag/SiO2 catalyst with the lowest Ag loading of 0.5 wt%. It was found that high-purity Ag powders with a low specific surface area of 0.37 m2/g displayed very poor hydrogenation activity (Conv. = 0.5% at 1.2 g loading and 373 K). On Ag powders, no crotyl alcohol product was detected and hydrocarbons derived from hydrogenolysis were the main products with a selectivity of 41%; butanol and butanal were also formed with selectivity of 26.7% and 32.4%, respectively. It is interesting that the desired crotyl alcohol can be formed on fresh Ag2O powders with a selectivity of 39.4%. However, crotyl alcohol rapidly disappeared in products because most of the oxygen is consumed by hydrogen (Ag2O + H2 = Ag + H2O) under the reaction conditions. Previous studies on the Ag-catalyzed hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes demonstrated that constructing electropositive or polar Ag sites favoring the coordination of the CO double bond is the key to promoting the production of unsaturated alcohols [23,34]. To enhance the surface acidity of silica, zirconia was chosen to decorate silica surfaces via the convenient impregnation method. Table 2 lists the catalytic data for a series of Ag/Zr–SiO2 with a fixed 30 wt% Ag loading prepared by the stepwise impregnation of ZrO(NO3)2 and AgNO3. Apparently, the doping of zirconia on silica promoted both the hydrogenation activity and the selectivity for the desired crotyl alcohol. A gradual increase in zirconia doping on silica from 0.5 to 5.0 wt% led to a gradual upsurge in crotyl alcohol selectivity from 68.4 to 80.1% and crotonaldehyde conversion from 48.9 to 73.9%. Further increasing the zirconia doping to 10.0 wt% decreased the catalytic activity but retained the crotyl alcohol selectivity at a high level (>80%). The modification of the silica surface by zirconia doping significantly altered the product distribution of the gas-phase crotonaldehyde hydrogenation. Along with the enhancement in CO monohydrogenation induced by zirconia doping, the dual hydrogenation to produce butanol significantly surpassed the monohydrogenation on the CC bond when the zirconia content exceeded 1.0 wt%. The 30Ag/SiO2 catalyst without zirconia modification yielded butanal as the second main product at a selectivity of 28.4%. In contrast, on the optimal 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2 catalyst, butanol was the second main product, with a selectivity of 17.2%, and simultaneously the selectivity for butanal was as low as 1.9%. Additionally, the hydrogenolysis to produce side products of hydrocarbons was inhibited to some extent by the zirconia doping on silica. This significant changeover in product distribution indicates that the modification of the silica surface by zirconia doping markedly promotes the CO bond hydrogenation. Significant boosting of the butanol selectivity may be ascribed to the butanal from the monohydrogenation of the CC bond rapidly undergoing subsequent hydrogenation on the CO bond. Furthermore, extremely low selectivity for butanal (1.9–2.6%) on the 30Ag/Zr–SiO2 catalysts with 3–10 wt% zirconia content indicates that the rate of butanal hydrogenation is probably higher than that of crotonaldehyde. Pure zirconia was also used to prepare Ag/ZrO2 catalyst for comparison. Very poor hydrogenation performance with a conversion of 2.5% and a selectivity for crotyl alcohol of 37.6% was observed on the 30Ag/ZrO2 with 30.0 wt% Ag loading, demonstrating that using only ZrO2 as a support for Ag is disadvantageous for the selective hydrogenation of CO bonds. 3.1.2 Influence of temperature and hydrogen/crotonaldehyde ratio For chemoselective hydrogenation of intramolecular CO and CC bonds of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, catalytic behavior is markedly influenced by reaction conditions including temperature, H2/crotonaldehyde ratio, and pressure. Fig. 1 shows the catalytic performance of 30Ag/SiO2 and 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2 in the quasi-steady state as a function of reaction temperature. A similar tendency was observed on the two catalysts that with the increase of temperature the catalytic activity increased significantly at the expense of the selectivity of the desired crotyl alcohol. Contrary to the decrease in crotyl alcohol selectivity, the selectivity for butanal, butanol, and hydrocarbons tended to increase in the temperature range 373–473 K on the 30Ag/SiO2. On the optimal 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2 with a zirconia content of 5 wt%, the crotyl alcohol selectivity remained at a high level (80.1–82.6%) as long as the temperature did not exceed 413 K. Increasing temperature from 373 to 413 K led to a sharp increase in butanol selectivity from 6.1% to 19.6% and a simultaneous decrease in butanal selectivity from 9.9% to 1.9%. Further increasing the temperature to 433 K or above significantly reduced the crotyl alcohol selectivity and enhanced the formation of butanal, butanol and hydrocarbons. Apparently, high reaction temperatures (>453 K) are not beneficial for efficient production of the desired crotyl alcohol because the dual hydrogenation to butanol, hydrogenolysis, and the monohydrogenation to butanal on the CC bond are markedly enhanced. Taking into account that the product distribution of crotonaldehyde not only is determined by the properties of the catalyst but also changes with the conversion level, a series of catalytic data at three temperatures (373, 413, and 453 K) at a constant H2/crotonaldehyde ratio and conversion (ca. 40%) are also compared (Table S1 in the Supplementary Data). For both 30Ag/SiO2 and 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2, increasing the reaction temperature tends to reduce the selectivity for unsaturated alcohol and promote the CC hydrogenation. A distinctive feature of 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2 is its high selectivity for the dual-hydrogenation product (butanol). In addition, hydrogenolysis to form hydrocarbon product becomes serious under high temperature. Pressure dependence of the selectivity for unsaturated alcohol has been discovered on the silica-supported Ag catalysts for acrolein hydrogenation, in which high pressure favors the formation of allyl alcohol from monohydrogenation on the CO bond induced by the promotion of beneficial adsorption geometry [20]. In this study, the product distribution of crotonaldehyde hydrogenation was found to be highly dependent on the ratio of hydrogen to crotonaldehyde under atmospheric pressure and constant hydrogen space velocity. For 30Ag/SiO2 and 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2, decreasing the H2/crotonaldehyde ratio from 100 to 8 led to a decrease in crotyl alcohol selectivity and a simultaneous increase in butanal selectivity (Fig. S1). This variation in chemoselectivity strongly suggests that the existence of adsorption competition among hydrogen, crotonaldehyde, and other products or intermediates for catalytic sites affects the adsorption geometry of crotonaldehyde. In principle, the CC and HH bonds are all nonpolar and tend to compete for metallic Ag surface sites, but the competition between the polar CO bond and the nonpolar HH bond may be weaker. Thus, the sticking probability of the CC bond may decrease at high hydrogen surface coverage, and thus an increase in crotyl alcohol selectivity is obtained. 3.1.3 Induction, deactivation, and regeneration of Ag/SiO2 and Ag/Zr–SiO2 catalysts Similarly to the phenomenon reported in literature, the catalytic behavior of the Ag/SiO2 and Ag/Zr–SiO2 catalysts was observed to be rapidly changing in the initial stage of the gas-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. Fig. 2 shows the evolution in catalytic behavior of the 30Ag/SiO2 and 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2 at 413 K under atmospheric pressure. It should be noted that, after the crotonaldehyde vapor was switched to pass through the freshly reduced 30Ag/SiO2 and 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2 catalysts, the carbon balances were less than 100% before the time on stream of 45 min, indicating that strong adsorption and/or deposit of substrates and/or products occurred in the initial stage of catalytic operation. After a time on stream of 65 min, the carbon balances increased to approximately 100%. On the 30Ag/SiO2, a high crotyl alcohol selectivity of approximately 75% was observed at 25–45 min with medium catalytic activity (Conv. < 60%). However, high crotyl alcohol selectivity could not be retained steadily and declined sharply to 66.8% at a time on stream of 125 min, along with a rapid recession in catalytic activity. Thereafter, the variation in crotonaldehyde conversion and product distribution became smoother. The 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2 with zirconia doping displayed much higher catalytic activity than the 30Ag/SiO2 in the initial stage. At a time on stream of 25–45 min, high crotonaldehyde conversion exceeding 90%, unusually high selectivity for butanol from dual hydrogenation (43.5–63.9%), and extremely low butanal selectivity (<2%) were observed. From a time on stream of 25 min to 165 min, the crotyl alcohol selectivity gradually improved from 34.1% to 81.4%, along with a decline in crotonaldehyde conversion. This continuous improvement in crotyl alcohol production probably arose from the marked recession of the subsequent hydrogenation on the CC bond of crotyl alcohol product due to the diminution of catalytic sites responsible for the CC bond hydrogenation. In a catalytic run lasting 1205 min, the selectivity for crotyl alcohol fluctuated only in a small range (79.1–82.6%), but the selectivity for butanal slowly increased from 1.9% to 10.3% at the expense of the butanol selectivity, which decreased from 17.2% to 7.6%. It should be noted that catalyst deactivation occurred to some extent on both 30Ag/SiO2 and 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2 in the quasi-steady stage. Although zirconia doping on the Ag/SiO2 catalyst promoted hydrogenation activity and selectivity for crotyl alcohol, the durability of modified Ag catalysts improved undistinctively. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) of the used 30Ag/SiO2 and 30Ag/Zr–SiO2 catalysts (Fig. S2) reveals that obvious weight loss can be observed in the temperature range 450–650 K, strongly suggesting the formation of strong adsorbates or carbonaceous deposits during the catalytic reaction, especially in the early stage in which a low carbon balance was observed. The formation of strong adsorbates or carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface should be responsible for the rapid change of catalytic behavior in the early stage and slow deactivation in the quasi-steady stage. In addition, these carbonaceous species may also be involved in modification of active sites and some catalytic steps such as hydrogen storage or exchange. Regeneration of the partially deactivated catalyst was attempted by a 120-min calcination in air at 573 K and a hydrogen reduction at 473 K for 30 min. The catalytic activity could be partly restored; however, the quick catalyst deactivation reappeared, similarly to that which happened in the transient stage observed on the fresh catalyst. After the regeneration treatment, the crotyl alcohol selectivity slightly increased on the 30Ag/SiO2 but decreased to some extent on the 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2. The partially reproducible activity implies that the complicated causes for the deactivation of Ag/SiO2 and Ag/Zr–SiO2 catalysts may include reversible blocking of active sites by strong adsorbates or deposits and irreversible changes in morphology of Ag crystallites, interfacial structure, and metal–support interaction."
8,Characterization of Ag/SiO2 and Ag/Zr–SiO2 catalysts,"3.2 Characterization of Ag/SiO2 and Ag/Zr–SiO2 catalysts 3.2.1 Catalyst textures and morphology of Ag particles The N2 physisorption isotherms in Figs. S3 and S4 and the texture parameters listed in Table 3 for Ag/SiO2 and Ag/Zr–SiO2 catalysts with different Ag loading and zirconia doping reveal that the mesoporous structure of the silica support, with an average pore size of ∼10 nm, was retained after the doping with zirconia and uploading of Ag onto supports by impregnation. Uploading Ag onto the silica support at a high Ag loading of 30.0 wt% resulted in the markedly reduced specific surface area and pore volume of the yielded catalysts as compared with that of the pure silica. These reductions mainly arose from the lowered actual amount of silica in the 30Ag/SiO2 catalyst with a silica content of 70.0 wt% and surface coverage and pore blocking by Ag particles. The zirconia doping slightly altered the mesoporous system, and the apparent reduction in specific surface area was only observed on the 30Ag/10Zr–SiO2 catalyst with a high zirconia content of 10.0 wt%. Fig. S5 displays the XRD patterns of the Ag/SiO2 catalysts with Ag loading ranging from 1.0 to 30.0 wt% after reduction by hydrogen. With increased Ag loading, the reflection intensity of Ag crystallites in the cubic phase constantly increased, while the broad peak centered at 22° ascribed to amorphous silica gradually weakened due to enrichment in surface-covering Ag particles. The Ag particle size of the 30Ag/SiO2 with a high Ag loading of 30.0 wt% derived by Scherrer’s equation increased to 14.9 nm, while that on the 1Ag/SiO2 with a low Ag loading of 1.0 wt% was only 6.6 nm (Table 3). TEM observation of 30Ag/SiO2 revealed that the Ag crystallites dispersed on silica surface had a statistical mean size of 14.8 nm (Fig. S6a), which was in good agreement with the XRD characterization. Relatively wide size distributions of Ag particles on the surface of silica were observed. Ag crystallites smaller than 5 nm and>20 nm simultaneously existed on the surface of the 30Ag/SiO2 catalyst. This feature is consistent with the Ag/SiO2 prepared from incipient wetness in the literature [19]. The different zirconia doping levels on the silica support led to changes in the XRD patterns of the reduced 30Ag/Zr-SiO2 catalysts (Fig. 3 ). The surface dispersion of Ag improved significantly, while the zirconia content was above 3.0 wt%, as evidenced by the obvious widening of XRD peaks characteristic of metallic Ag. The average Ag particle size of the 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2 with a zirconia content of 5.0 wt% was 9.2 nm, and further increasing the zirconia content to 10.0 wt% reduced the size to 6.5 nm (Table 3). TEM observation showed that the Ag crystallites dispersed on the surface of 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2 possessed a statistical mean size of 10.5 nm, which was slightly larger than the result from XRD characterization (Fig. S6c). In addition, even at a high zirconia content of 10.0 wt%, no XRD peaks characteristic of zirconia phases were detected, indicating that zirconia species on the silica surface were in extremely high dispersion or an amorphous state. Partially deactivated catalysts were characterized by XRD and TEM. The XRD patterns of the used 30Ag/SiO2 and 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2 after catalytic operation at <413 K for approximately 1000 min were similar to those of their fresh counterparts (Fig. S7), suggesting that the crystallinities and apparent mean sizes of Ag crystallites did not change obviously. This result was also confirmed by TEM observation (Fig. S6). A slight difference between fresh and used Ag catalysts in the apparent size distribution of Ag crystallites is mainly ascribed to the gas-phase crotonaldehyde hydrogenation having been conducted at a relatively low temperature (≤413 K), which cannot seriously induce thermal migration and sintering of Ag particles. Although the apparent size distribution of Ag particles changed only slightly, the irreversible deactivation that has substantially occurred during catalytic operation reminds us that some key factors other than the Ag particle size play important roles in determining catalytic behavior. The morphology and orientation of Ag particles on the SiO2 and Zr–SiO2 supports were investigated by HR-TEM (Fig. S8). On both 30Ag/SiO2 and 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2 catalysts reduced by hydrogen at 473 K, most of the Ag particles exposed the most densely packed (1 1 1) plane with a lattice spacing of 0.237 nm. Single-crystalline and multiply twinned Ag particles are present on the surfaces of SiO2 and Zr–-SiO2 supports. It should be noted that, on some boundaries of round Ag crystallites close to the support, the measured lattice spacing is ∼ 0.251 nm, somewhat greater than that for Ag(1 1 1), 0.237 nm. This lattice expansion can probably be ascribed to the interaction of interfacial Ag and the support or the subsurface oxygen dissolved in Ag crystallites. 3.2.2 Redox properties and surface acidity The TPR profile of the 30Ag/SiO2 in Fig. 4 a shows that the reduction of Ag species on the silica surface by hydrogen began at a relatively low temperature (<373 K) and the reduction peak was centered at 432 K. Zirconia doping on silica supports did not obviously change the intensity and shape of the reduction patterns, but interestingly shifted the position of the reduction peak to a higher temperature. The increase in zirconia content from 0.5 to 10.0 wt% gradually elevated the peak temperature for the reduction of Ag species from 432 to 478 K. On the 30Ag/10Zr–SiO2 with the highest zirconia content of 10.0 wt%, the summit of the reduction peak appeared at 478 K, which was 46 K higher than that of the unmodified 30Ag/SiO2. The change in redox properties induced by zirconia doping possibly arises from (1) the formation of some kind of composite oxides composed of zirconia and Ag oxides with relatively poor reactivity to hydrogen and (2) covering of some Ag species with zirconia to reduce the accessibility of hydrogen. Quantitative analysis of reducible Ag in a series Ag catalyst precursor is also performed (Table S2). It is found that the amount of reducible Ag species on the 30Ag/SiO2 precursor is less than that on catalysts with zirconia modification, possibly arising from the different extent in the decomposition of AgNO3 to metal Ag during the calcination. When the zirconia content ≥3%, the amounts of reducible Ag species were close to but still less than the nominal value. The acidic properties of 30Ag/Zr–SiO2 catalysts with different zirconia doping levels were investigated using the NH3 TPD technique (Fig. 5 and Table S3). For pure SiO2, only a weak NH3 desorption peak, which corresponds to an amount of acidic sites of 10.9 μmol/g-cat, appeared near 493 K and a calibrated amount. The uploading of Ag onto the SiO2 surface at a high loading of 30.0 wt% significantly enhanced the intensity of the NH3 desorption peak (26.0 μmol/g-cat) and simultaneously shifted desorption to a higher temperature at 512 K. This enhancement of NH3 adsorption on moderate acidic sites is ascribed to the Ag species dispersed on the SiO2 surface as Lewis acid sites. Importantly, the quantity and strength of surface acid sites were markedly enhanced by the zirconia doping on silica. The 5Zr–SiO2, with an optimized zirconia content of 5.0 wt%, presented a larger ammonia desorption peak (24.0 μmol/g-cat) near 513 K to replace that on pure SiO2 at 493 K (Fig. 5b). In addition, the appearance of an extra desorption peak (45.2 μmol/g-cat) at a high temperature of 799 K suggests the formation of strong acid sites on zirconia–silica composites. It should be noted that the uploading of Ag onto the Zr–SiO2 composites diminished the NH3 desorption peak corresponding to the strong acid sites, indicating the complete coverage of these sites by Ag species at a high Ag loading. Particularly, the ammonia bonded to the 30Ag/Zr–SiO2 catalysts desorbed at a lower temperature than that bonded to the 30Ag/SiO2 without zirconia doping. The ammonia desorption peak on the 30Ag/Zr–SiO2 with zirconia content ranging from 0.5 to 5.0 wt% was located at 493–499 K, whereas that for the 30Ag/10Zr–SiO2 with the highest zirconia content of 10.0 wt% was 512 K. In addition, under an identical Ag loading of 30 wt%, the amount of NH3 bonded to the surface Ag sites tended to increase with the increase in the zirconia content (Table S3). This mainly arose from the above-mentioned promotional effect of zirconia doping on the Ag dispersion, as revealed by the XRD and TEM characterizations. 3.2.3 O2 chemisorption and chemical state of Ag Measurement of the metallic dispersion of Ag/SiO2 and Ag/Zr-SiO2 catalysts was attempted by dynamic O2 chemisorption using a pulse-injection technique, in which a low temperature (323 K) was adopted with the purpose of avoiding bulk diffusion of oxygen (Table 4 ). However, the unexpected result that the micrometer-sized Ag powders barely chemisorbed oxygen cast doubt on the feasibility of calculating the number of surface Ag atoms based on a stoichiometric reaction between surface Ag and O2. The possibility of inadequate dosage could be excluded because 2.0 g Ag powders with a specific surface area of 0.37 m2/g were sufficient, given that the surface Ag atoms could bond oxygen irreversibly under 323 K. In contrast, all the reduced Ag/SiO2 and Ag/ Zr–SiO2 catalysts were able to chemisorb O2 even when the Ag loading was as low as 1.0 wt%. The quantity of chemisorbed O2 was strongly dependent on the Ag loading and the content of doped zirconia. For the Ag catalysts supported on pure SiO2, low Ag loading appeared to be beneficial for promoting O2 uptake (per gram Ag). A high O2 uptake of 93.8 μmol/g-Ag was observed on the 1Ag/SiO2 with a low Ag loading, and further increasing the Ag loading led to the decline of the O2 uptake based on the Ag mass. Zirconia doping on silica brought about substantial promotion in O2 chemisorption. At a high Ag loading of 30.0 wt%, the O2 uptake on the freshly reduced 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2 was 45.4 μmol/g-Ag, much higher than that on the 30Ag/SiO2 without zirconia doping (28.0 μmol/g-Ag). It is noteworthy that the O2 chemisorption abilities of these Ag catalysts correlated closely to their catalytic activities (Table 4). The 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2 with a higher O2 uptake displayed much higher catalytic activity than 30Ag/SiO2. This strong correlation between catalytic activity and O2 chemisorption ability was also observed on the partially deactivated 30Ag/SiO2 and 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2. The O2 uptake of the 30Ag/SiO2 and 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2 decreased considerably just as their catalytic activity did after catalytic operation at 413 K lasted for 1200 min. The attempt to discriminate the chemisorbed oxygen species on Ag/SiO2 and Ag/Zr–SiO2 via in situ Raman spectrum analysis gave no valuable information, since no changes could be observed after O2 was introduced into the reduced Ag catalysts. Based on the stoichiometry of Ag/O2 = 2 used in the literature [35], the calculated amount of active Ag capable of chemisorbing O2 (Agactive) on the 30Ag/SiO2 is 16.8 μmol/g-cat and the Agactive/Agtotal ratio (total Ag amount in catalyst) is as low as 0.006. This extremely low value does not match the value of Agsurface/Agtotal (0.079) derived from the average Ag particle size determined by TEM and XRD using a hemispherical model (diameter 14.9 nm), strongly indicating that only a small portion of the surface Ag has a unique redox property at a relatively low temperature of 323 K. The periphery hypothesis for CO oxidation on supported Au catalysts is that oxygen molecules are activated at the perimeter interfaces [36]. For a hemispherical Ag crystallite with diameter 14.9 nm, the ratio of Ag in the perimeter interface to Agtotal is ∼0.004, which is close to the measured Agactive/Agtotal. Therefore, it is most likely that those Ag in the accessible interface tightly contacting the support surface are the active Ag sites for O2 chemisorption. The measured Agactive/Agtotal ratio for 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2 (0.010) is higher than that for 30Ag/SiO2. This enhancement is mainly ascribed to the promotion of Ag dispersion and the increase of the perimeter interface induced by zirconia doping. XPS and Auger characterization were performed to investigate the chemical state of Ag species on the 30Ag/SiO2 and 30Ag/Zr–SiO2 catalysts. The charging was calibrated with the binding energy (BE) of Si2p (103.4 eV) characteristic of SiO2 and then the O1s peak was centered at 532.8 eV, in good agreement with literature data. The peaks of Ag3d 5/2 for the 30Ag/SiO2 and 30Ag/Zr–SiO2 catalysts reduced by hydrogen at 623 K appeared in a BE range of 367.7–368.1 eV (Fig. 6 ), resulting in ambiguous determination of the chemical state of Ag species (the characteristic BEs of metallic Ag0 and Ag2O are 368.1 and 367.7 eV, respectively). The modified Auger parameter (the sum of the kinetic energy of the Auger electron (Ag M4N45N45) and the BE of the Ag3d 5/2 core-level peak), which is independent of charging and sensitive to chemical shifts [37], was calculated for the 30Ag/SiO2 and 30Ag/Zr–SiO2 catalysts (Fig. 6). The modified Auger parameters for these catalysts were close to the Auger parameter for Ag0 at 726.1 eV [38], demonstrating that most of the Ag species were in the metallic state, which was in good agreement with the results of XRD characterization. The Zr3d XPS spectra for the reduced Ag/Zr–SiO2 catalysts were also measured in order to monitor the oxidation state of zirconium (Fig. S9). Increasing the zirconia content from 1 to 10 wt% gradually increases the intensity of XPS peaks corresponding to Zr3d 5/2 and Zr3d 3/2. No obvious difference in the chemical states of Zr species on the Ag/Zr–SiO2 catalysts with different zirconia content exists, because the BE values for them are all close to 182.8 and 185.0 eV, which are characteristic of Zr4+, that is, ZrO2. In addition, 5Zr–SiO2 calcined in air at 773 K was found to display a Zr3d XPS spectrum similar to those of the reduced 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2 catalysts (Fig. S9a), further indicating that the presence of Ag and the hydrogen treatment do not obviously change the chemical state of ZrO2 dispersed on the SiO2 surface. The surface Si/Ag, Ag/Zr, and Si/Zr ratios of a series of 30Ag catalysts determined by XPS characterization are also listed in Table S2 with the bulk ratios. The surface Si/Ag ratios of a series of Ag catalysts with 30 wt% Ag loading are all higher than the bulk values, probably arising from many Ag species being dispersed on the internal surfaces of support mesopores. Low Zr content (≤3 wt%) slightly increases the surface Si/Ag ratio in comparison with the 30Ag/SiO2 catalyst, but further increasing the Zr content reduces the surface Si/Ag ratio. It should be noted that the surface Si/Ag ratio of a deactivated 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2 catalyst is higher than that of the fresh one. It is assumed that the carbonaceous deposits covering the surface Ag sites during the catalytic reaction is responsible. Similarly, the surface Si/Zr ratio on the 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2 catalyst also increase to some extent after long-term catalytic operation. 3.2.4 Kinetic behavior Difficulties in the kinetic study of the gas-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde arise because serious deactivation in the transit stage and gradual deactivation in the quasi-steady stage always happen. It seems impossible to validly study the kinetics in the transit stage because all catalytic data are obtained on an Ag catalyst under quite different status. However, the long-term catalytic behavior displayed in Fig. 2 reveals that those Ag catalysts in the quasi-steady stage are relatively stable and provide a chance for valid kinetic study. Fig. S10 shows the Arrhenius plots for crotonaldehyde hydrogenation over the 30Ag/SiO2 and 30Ag/Zr–SiO2 catalysts in the quasi-steady state. The apparent activation energy (E a) of 30Ag/SiO2 is 47.1 kJ/mol in the temperature range 373–413 K, which is higher than that of 30Ag/Zr–SiO2 (39.7 kJ/mol). The reduction in E a induced by zirconia doping on the silica support clearly indicates, in addition to the changes in the size and dispersion of Ag particles, the surface adsorption and activation of substrates and products desorption on the Ag/Zr–SiO2 are essentially altered by the formation of unique catalytic structures co-constructed from Ag, SiO2, and ZrO2. Since two competing reactions (crotyl alcohol from CO monohydrogenation and butanal from CC monohydrogenation) occur simultaneously in the catalytic hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, the Arrhenius plots of the formation of crotyl alcohol and butanal are also shown in Fig. S9. For both 30Ag/SiO2 and 30Ag/Zr–SiO2, the E a(crotyl alcohol) for the formation of crotyl alcohol is lower than E a(butanal), suggesting that low temperatures favor the selective hydrogen of CO bonds. Zirconia doping on silica reduces the apparent activation energies for both crotyl alcohol and butanal. The effects of hydrogen and crotonaldehyde partial pressure on the formation rates of hydrogenation products are displayed in Figs. S11 and S12. On both 30Ag/SiO2 and 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2, the crotyl alcohol and butanal formation rates increase linearly with the increase of crotonaldehyde and hydrogen partial pressure. Over 30Ag/SiO2, the apparent reaction orders of hydrogen for crotyl alcohol and butanal formation are 0.18 and 0.25, respectively (Figs. 7 and 8 ). It is interesting that the apparent reaction orders of crotonaldehyde for crotyl alcohol and butanal formation (0.60 and 0.62) are higher than those of hydrogen. This observation suggests that the adsorption and activation of crotonaldehyde are more rate-determining than the activation of hydrogen on the Ag/SiO2 catalyst. The zirconia doping on SiO2 increases the H2 order for crotyl alcohol formation from 0.18 to 0.27 and simultaneously reduces that for butanal formation from 0.25 to 0.10. The close to zero order of H2 for CC bond hydrogenation on 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2 implies that the surface concentration of the active hydrogen species responsible for the CC hydrogenation is nearly saturated under the reaction conditions. In contrast, the increase of hydrogen partial pressure increases the surface concentration of the active hydrogen species responsible for CO hydrogenation, as evidenced by the higher H2 order for crotyl alcohol formation. Importantly, the apparent reaction orders of crotonaldehyde on 30Ag/Zr–SiO2 are much lower than those on 30Ag/SiO2. The zirconia doping on SiO2 significantly reduces the crotonaldehyde order for crotyl alcohol formation from 0.60 to 0.34, suggesting the enhancement of the capability for CO activation."
9,Discussion,"In this study of the influence of zirconia doping on the silica support in Ag-catalyzed crotonaldehyde hydrogenation, promotions including improved selectivity for unsaturated alcohol (crotyl alcohol), enhanced hydrogenation activity, and promoted catalyst stability were observed on the Ag/Zr–SiO2 catalysts. The enhancement in hydrogenation activity can reasonably be ascribed to the improved Ag surface dispersion induced by zirconia doping on silica. The XRD and TEM characterizations all clearly revealed that the average Ag particle size of the reduced 30Ag/SiO2 was larger than that of the reduced 30Ag/Zr–SiO2, especially when the zirconia content exceeded 3.0 wt%. The NH3 TPD investigation illuminated that the promotion of metallic dispersion induced by zirconia doping mainly originated from the significant change in surface acidic properties. The quantity and strength of surface acid sites on the Zr–SiO2 composites were markedly enhanced, as evidenced by the significantly increased amount of desorbed ammonia, the higher desorption temperature, and the emergence of strong acidic sites. It is well known that silica surfaces are weakly acidic, with an isoelectric point ranging from 1.7 to 3.5. Therefore, inadequate electronegative adsorption sites capable of sticking to the Ag cations in AgNO3 solution do not favor the fabrication of a catalyst precursor with high Ag dispersion under relatively high metal loading [39]. In fact, the 30Ag/SiO2 catalyst prepared by incipient wetness impregnation had a large average Ag particle size close to 15 nm. Upon zirconia doping on silica, the enhanced surface acidity provided more adsorption sites for anchoring Ag cations and subsequently enabled the stabilization of small Ag crystallites during calcination and hydrogen reduction. The disappearance of strong acid sites on the Ag/Zr–SiO2 catalysts revealed by the NH3 TPD characterization is a strong proof for the occupation and coverage of acid sites on the Zr–SiO2 composites by Ag species. The promotional effect of zirconia doping on Ag dispersion is significant, so that the 30Ag/10Zr–SiO2 possessed a small Ag particle size of 6.5 nm, even under an Ag loading as high as 30.0 wt%. Previous investigation of silica-supported Ag catalysts from different preparation methods proposed that the chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol was structure-insensitive because the selectivity of unsaturated alcohol was independent of the Ag particle size in the range 3.7–6.3 nm [18]. Our catalytic results for a series of Ag/SiO2 catalysts with different Ag loading and Ag particle size seem to disagree with this assumption of size-independent catalysis. In this study, the Ag/SiO2 catalysts with low Ag loading (0.5–1.0 wt%) and small Ag particle size (<8.5 nm) displayed poorer crotyl alcohol selectivity (<60%) than those with higher Ag loading and larger Ag particle size. However, the important fact that pure SiO2 did catalyze the crotonaldehyde hydrogenation to some extent to yield butanal as the main product should not be ignored. Since the Ag/SiO2 catalysts with low Ag loadings displayed poor catalytic activity, the undesired hydrogenation products catalyzed by the silica surface uncovered by Ag species could not be overlooked, resulting in the relatively low crotyl alcohol selectivity. Anyway, high coverage of Ag species on silica surface is beneficial for promoting the selectivity and space time yield of desired crotyl alcohol. Although the Ag particle size effect seems to be inconspicuous in the product distribution of crotonaldehyde hydrogenation catalyzed by Ag/SiO2 catalysts, the support effect is significant in the monohydrogenation of the CO bond to produce the desired crotyl alcohol. Pure Ag powder is completely inactive in catalyzing the monohydrogenation of the CO bond. However, once silica is adopted to support Ag particles, the monohydrogenation of the CO bond in crotonaldehyde is triggered and the desired crotyl alcohol is produced as the main product with high selectivity. Furthermore, the considerable change in product distribution induced by zirconia doping on silica also stresses the crucial support effect on Ag-catalyzed crotonaldehyde hydrogenation. On the most active 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2 catalyst, very little butanal was formed from the monohydrogenation of the CC bond, with an extremely low selectivity of 1.9%, but simultaneously, the selectivity ford butanol from dual hydrogenation was raised to a high level (17.2%). In contrast, the butanal selectivity (28.4%) of the 30Ag/SiO2 catalyst without modification was much higher than the butanol selectivity (3.1%) under identical conditions. The considerable boosting of alcohol production on the Ag/Zr–SiO2 catalysts strongly demonstrates that zirconia doping on silica substantially promotes the chemoselective hydrogenation of the CO bond. This marked promotion is assumed to arise from the strong interaction between Ag species and zirconia doped on the silica surface and the consequent formation of electropositive Ag sites effective for bonding and activating CO bonds. It seems difficult to explain why the apparent Ag particle sizes of the deactivated Ag/SiO2 and Ag/Zr–SiO2 catalysts determined by XRD and TEM were almost unchanged, but in the meantime, the catalytic activity deteriorated seriously. Fortunately, the measurement of O2 chemisorption provided valuable information for probing the nature of active sites for chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. Dynamic O2 chemisorption measurement at a relatively low temperature of 323 K clearly revealed that the surfaces of pure Ag powders mainly composing the Ag(1 1 1) facet did not irreversibly chemisorb oxygen. An extremely low sticking probability of molecularly or atomically adsorbed oxygen species on the Ag(1 1 1) facet had been theoretically disclosed in a previous study [40]. Nevertheless, uploading Ag onto the surface of SiO2 or Zr–SiO2 composites via impregnation unexpectedly activates the ability of Ag crystallites to chemisorb oxygen at a low temperature. This oxygen-bonding ability could be observed on Ag/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Ag loading from 0.5 to 30 wt%. Furthermore, the O2 uptake based on Ag mass for the fresh Ag/SiO2 catalysts clearly displayed correlative variation with the Ag particle size determined by XRD and TEM (Tables 3 and 4). This correlation between O2 uptake and Ag particle size was also observed on the Ag/Zr–SiO2 catalysts with zirconia doping on silica. The freshly reduced 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2 with an average Ag particle size of 9.2 nm exhibited an O2 uptake of 45.4 μmol/g-Ag, which was much higher than that of the 30Ag/SiO2 (28.0 μmol/g-Ag) with a larger Ag particle size of 14.9 nm. Importantly, the amounts of chemisorbed O2 on these supported Ag catalysts are much lower than that of surface Ag calculated from XRD and TEM characterization. Combining this finding with the result of the HR-TEM observation that most of the surface of Ag crystallites on SiO2 and Zr-SiO2 support is Ag(1 1 1) facets, it is reasonable to identify those Ag species on the perimeter interface instead of the surface Ag on Ag(1 1 1) as the O2 chemisorption sites. Using the hemispherical model, the calculated ratios of Agperimeter/Agtotal on the 30Ag/SiO2 and 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2 are all close to the measured values of Agactive/Agtotal, strongly supporting the perimeter interface hypothesis. The low-temperature O2 chemisorption observed on supported Ag catalysts probably arises from the interaction between interfacial Ag and oxide support bringing about some physiochemical changes such as lattice expansion, coordination number, and chemical valance. Mavrikakis et al. indicated that metal surface reactivity increases with lattice expansion, based on their self-consistent density functional calculations [41]. Similarly to the observation in the literature [42], lattice expansion on the boundary area between Ag layers and oxide support was found in our HR-TEM characterization on supported Ag catalysts (Fig. S7). In addition, the interfacial Ag sites on the perimeter of the hemispheric Ag particle have a low coordination number, like the sites on a sharp-angle step. These unique features may endow interfacial Ag sites with enhanced reactivity to O2. In heterogeneous catalysis, reaction rate or catalytic activity is generally governed by factors including numbers and abilities of catalytic sites, temperature, concentrations of reactants, and reaction orders. In this study, the catalytic activities of the Ag/SiO2 catalysts with different Ag loadings apparently increased with the increase of their O2 uptake (Table 4), implying close correlation between the catalytic sites for crotonaldehyde hydrogenation and the oxygen-bonding sites. O2 chemisorption measurement on the deactivated 30Ag/SiO2 and 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2 catalysts further confirmed the presence of this correlation. Although the apparent Ag particle size determined by XRD and TEM was almost unchanged on both the deactivated 30Ag/SiO2 and 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2 catalysts, their O2 uptake markedly declined, along with their catalytic activity. In Fig. 9 , the catalytic activity as a function of the O2 uptake for the fresh and deactivated Ag/SiO2 and Ag/Zr-SiO2 catalysts is plotted to clearly display the non-negligible correlation of catalytic sites to the chemisorption sites for oxygen. With respect to the exact locations of catalytic sites for chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, Ag sites on the facets, steps, edges, and corners of Ag crystallites and perimeter metal–support interfaces are all possible candidates. Based on this study, it seems more reasonable to identify the perimeter Ag–support interface sites as the catalytic sites for chemoselective crotonaldehyde hydrogenation. First, previous theoretical study has demonstrated that the single-crystal surfaces of silver do not participate in the chemoselective hydrogenation due to the extremely low adsorption probability [24]. In our study, the pure Ag powders mainly composed of Ag(1 1 1) and a small number of the corner and edge sites were found to be completely inactive for producing the desired crotyl alcohol and chemisorbing oxygen, even under increased dosage. Conversely, the desired crotyl alcohol from the monohydrogenation of the CO bond appeared as the main product on supported Ag catalysts. This significant support effect strongly implies that the effective active sites for the CO hydrogenation are co-constructed by supports and Ag crystallites and are located at the accessible interface. Generally, the proportion of low-coordination sites (step, edge, and corner) increases with the decrease of metal particle size [43]. In fact, our investigation of the influence of Ag loading disclosed that those Ag/SiO2 catalysts with low Ag loading and small Ag particles exhibited relatively poor selectivity for the desired unsaturated alcohol. This result further provides support for the viewpoint of perimeter interface. Another important fact, that the zirconia doping on silica induced a marked change in product distribution, stresses the crucial role of zirconia species in influencing the chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. This strong effect should not be a simple size effect, but most probably is exerted by the interfacial zirconia species modifying the adjacent Ag active sites and forming ternary Ag–ZrO2–SiO2 interfaces. Second, the weak size dependence of crotyl alcohol selectivity on Ag/SiO2 catalysts was disclosed in literature and this study [18]. In contrast, the support effect was found to be vital in the catalytic production of crotyl alcohol. If the facet, edge, and corner Ag sites are responsible for chemoselective crotonaldehyde hydrogenation, the slight change in apparent Ag particle size observed on the seriously deactivated Ag/SiO2 and Ag/Zr–SiO2 catalysts should be in contrast to their marked deterioration in catalytic activity. However, the interfacial structures are not only influenced by the shape and size of metal particles, but also dependent on features including the support–metal interaction, the fraction of interfacial atoms of metal crystallites, and the thickness of metal layers. Conventional characterizations by XRD and TEM are insensitive to these features. Third, our investigation reveals that the low-temperature O2 chemisorption capability clearly displays a close correlation with the crotonaldehyde hydrogenation activity on supported Ag catalysts. The amounts of Ag active for O2 chemisorption are much lower than that of the surface Ag calculated from TEM and XRD characterizations, but match well the perimeter interface Ag of hemispherical particles. Below 323 K, the irreversible chemisorption of O2 only occurred on Ag particles dispersed on the surface of SiO2 and Zr–SiO2 supports, strongly indicating the unique redox properties of interfacial metal. A previous study using X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that the metals at the interface were polarized sufficiently via bonding with the oxygen of the support, and hydrogen treatment on the supported metals induced a greater metal–support oxygen distance [44]. This metastable interface structure may be apt to bond oxygen while placed in an oxidizing atmosphere. Tentatively, a mechanism for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol at Ag–-SiO2 and Ag–ZrO2–SiO2 interface is proposed in Scheme S1. Since the perimeter interface Ag atoms inevitably interact with the oxygen from ZrO2 and SiO2, the induced decrease in electron density generates a population of interfacial Agδ+ sites, which are partially electropositive. The Agδ+ site and neighboring oxygen from oxide support can form a kind of combinational site active for the polar adsorption and activation of the CO bond of crotonaldehyde. Simultaneously, dihydrogen is dissociatively chemisorbed at stepped or cornered Ag sites with low coordination number to form active hydrogen species. The neighboring or spillover active hydrogen species can attack the activated crotonaldehyde at the interface to yield unsaturated alcohol product. The surface adsorption and activation of H2 on Ag catalysts is a key step in the catalytic cycle of crotonaldehyde hydrogenation. Our measurement of hydrogen adsorption on Ag powder and supported Ag catalysts reveals that no irreversible hydrogen adsorption can be measured due to the very weak interaction between hydrogen and silver. An interesting kinetic study reveals that the apparent reaction orders of hydrogen for the 30Ag/SiO2 and 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2 catalysts are all lower than 0.3. The estimated zero reaction order with respect to hydrogen concentration seems to be contradictory to the generally accepted view that hydrogen activation is crucial and hydrogen species are involved in the rate-determining step in Ag-catalyzed hydrogenation due to the poor hydrogen affinity of metallic Ag. Note that the measured hydrogen reaction orders for the monohydrogenation of CC and CO bonds are different. The presence of homolytic and heterolytic hydrogen activation probably accounts for the difference. The hydrogenation of the polarized CO bond prefers the H− and H+ species from the heterolytic activation, while the addition of the atomic hydrogen from the homolytic dissociation of the CC bond follows the Horiuti–Polanyi mechanism. The zirconia doping on SiO2 brings about an increase in the hydrogen reaction order for the formation of the desired unsaturated alcohol and a simultaneous reduction for the butanal formation, possibly implying that the involvement of zirconia species brings about different hydrogen activation and changes the dominance of the homolytic and heterolytic hydrogen activation patterns to some extent. Over Ag/SiO2, the estimated reaction orders with respect to the crotonaldehyde pressure are higher than the hydrogen reaction orders, suggesting that the effective activation of crotonaldehyde is the rate-determining step and the Eley–Rideal reaction mechanism can be excluded. This kinetic behavior is different from another highly selective catalyst, Ir/SiO2 (crotyl alcohol selectivity = 86%), on which the reaction order of crotonaldehyde is lower than that of hydrogen [13]. Considering that pure Ag particles without interfacial sites are completely inactive for the monohydrogenation of the CO bond to produce unsaturated alcohol, it is reasonable to indicate the vital role of perimeter interface Ag sites in activating the CO bond. In fact, the number of perimeter interface Ag sites is sparse as compared with the surface Ag. Therefore, the formation and supply of the crotonaldehyde adspecies activated at the CO bond and their subsequent reaction with the adjacent or spillover active hydrogen species determine the hydrogenation rate. Zirconia doping on SiO2 is found to reduce the reaction orders with respect to the crotonaldehyde pressure, indicating that the adsorption of crotonaldehyde on Ag/Zr–SiO2 is stronger than that on Ag/SiO2. The interpretation is that the Lewis acidic sites enhanced by zirconia doping provide more effective sites for binding the polar CO bonds. In summary, the accessible interface Ag sites rather than the facet, edge, step, and corner Ag sites are assumed to play crucial roles in the chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol. The interfacial Ag sites polarized by oxide supports act as catalytic sites for chemisorbing and activating the polar CO bonds and then drive catalytic hydrogenation to form the desired crotyl alcohol as the main product. The Zr–SiO2 composite with enhanced acidity not only leads to the improved dispersion of Ag crystallites beneficial for promoting catalytic activity, but also helps to construct unique ternary Ag–ZrO2–SiO2 interfacial structures with boosted capability for activating CO bonds and producing the desired unsaturated alcohol. This study of Ag-catalyzed chemoselective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes strongly indicates that the complicated support effect in heterogeneous metal catalysis may originate from the unique interfacial structure constructed by the metal and support."
10,Conclusions,"In the gas-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, via zirconia doping on the surface of silica, the catalytic behavior of supported Ag catalysts can be significantly tuned to favor the production of the desired crotyl alcohol from the monohydrogenation of the CO bond. High crotyl alcohol selectivity exceeding 80% and improved catalytic activity were obtained on the optimized 30Ag/5Zr–SiO2 catalysts. Zirconia doping on the silica surface substantially enhances the number and strength of acid sites, promotes the surface dispersion of Ag species, and stabilizes Ag crystallites in smaller sizes. These promotional effects bring about boosted catalytic activity and prolonged lifetime of catalysts. The measurement of O2 chemisorption at 323 K disclosed that pure Ag powders without interfacial sites did not irreversibly chemisorb oxygen, but all supported Ag catalysts did, strongly indicating synergism between metal and oxide supports in constructing the oxygen-bonding sites, which are most likely to locate in the accessible Ag–support interface. The amounts of chemisorbed oxygen on the Ag/SiO2 and Ag/Zr–SiO2 catalysts with different Ag dispersions and deactivation degrees were found to correlate closely with the hydrogenation activity. This investigation strongly implies a close correlation between the catalytic sites and the oxygen-bonding sites. It is assumed that the accessible interface Ag sites, rather than the facet, step, edge, and corner sites, are responsible for the chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol. The catalytic production of the desired crotyl alcohol with high selectivity may be attributed to the interface Ag sites with unique redox properties and polarizations, which are beneficial for chemisorbing and activating the polar CO bonds. Greatly improved crotyl alcohol selectivity on the Ag/Zr–SiO2 catalysts probably originates from the formation of the ternary Ag–ZrO2–SiO2 interfacial sites. Catalyst induction and deactivation observed on the Ag/SiO2 and Ag/Zr–SiO2 catalysts indicate that the Ag–support interfacial structures are changeable under real catalytic operation."
