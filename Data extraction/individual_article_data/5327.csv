0,Introduction,"The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an aqueous medium is a fundamental reaction in electrochemical water splitting to produce clean hydrogen (H2) energy and the suitable electrocatalysts are vital to lowering the overpotential and promoting the HER efficiency.[1] Although noble metals such as Pt show excellent HER activity, wide application is hampered by the cost and scarcity. Therefore, earth-abundant materials such as metal hydroxides, carbides, nitrides, sulfides, and phosphides have been investigated as alternative HER catalysts.[2–6] Especially, transition metal carbides (TMCs) and nitrides (TMNs) such as Mo2C, MoC, Mo2N, and WN are promising candidates because of their Pt-like d-band electronic structures, low cost, high electron conductivity, and good chemical stability.[7] However, the HER performances of TMCs and TMNs are compromised by the limited active sites and strong M−H bonds.[8] Recently, ultra-small nanodots and porous three-dimensional (3D) structures and heterostructures of TMCs or TMNs have been designed to improve the HER characteristics by increasing the number of active sites and facilitating electrolyte diffusion. Especially, heterostructured TMCs/TMNs via interfacial engineering offer a promising strategy to enhance the HER performance by regulating the interfacial electron distribution and adsorption/desorption of H atoms.[9,10] For example, Mo2N-Mo2C/HGr shows an smaller overpotential of 157 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in HER compared to 190 and 296 mV observed from Mo2C/HGr and Mo2N/HGr [11] and W2N/WC heterostructured catalysts prepared by solid-state synthesis show efficient and robust HER electrocatalytic properties with a low overpotential of 148.5 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in an alkaline media.[12] However, these reported TMCs/TMNs electrocatalysts have weak electron-donating properties because of the comparable electronegativity between adjacent N and C atoms [13–16] and therefore, the HER properties need to be further improved. In our previous work, we observed that heterostructured Mo2C/VC@C had improved HER activity because V atoms with small electronegativity modulated the electronic states of the active Mo2C thereby producing a smaller hydrogen adsorption energy and low overpotential of 122 mV at 10 mA cm−2.[17] In this context, construction of heterointerface in TMCs/TMNs with strong electron interactions using different metal cations and non-metal anions is a promising strategy to promote charge transfer, improve the HER electrolytic activity, and enhance the HER kinetics. However, controllable and facile synthesis of the desirable heterostructured electrocatalysts with robust heterointerfaces is still challenging. Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) porous HER electrocatalyst consisting of closely connected γ-MoC and VN (denoted as γ-MoC/VN) with robust electron coupling is prepared by in situ carbonization and nitridation of bulk V2MoO8 as illustrated in Fig. 1 a. The hybrid γ-MoC/VN catalyst boasts several advantages in HER. Firstly, the γ-MoC/VN heterostructure has a mesoporous structure and abundant interfaces, which provide more active sites and facilitate access of electrolytes and release of H2 bubbles.[18] Secondly, the γ-MoC/VN heterostructure generated in situ possesses strong interfacial electron interactions and the tailored density of state (DOS) redistribution enabled by the electron donating characteristics of VN gives rise to enhanced catalytic activity. Thirdly, the γ-MoC/VN heterostructure exhibits a metallic behavior and the robust interfaces of γ-MoC/VN promote charge transfer and reduce polarization resulting in fast HER kinetics. Fourthly, the γ-MoC/VN electrocatalyst has high chemical and structural stability, and consequently excellent electrochemical durability during HER testing. Owing to these merits, the heterostructured γ-MoC/VN catalyst shows excellent HER catalytic activity and performance such as a small overpotential of 86.6 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte and low Tafel slope of 47.6 mV dec-1, which are superior to the those of recently reported Mo-based electrocatalysts.[2] Moreover, the heterostructured γ-MoC/VN exhibits excellent durability with 99% voltage retention after 16 h testing at 10 mA cm−2. This work offers a novel route to construct mesoporous TMCs/TMNs heterostructured catalysts for high-performance electrocatalytic water splitting and energy conversion."
1,Experimental section,
2,Synthesis of γ-MoC/VN heterostructure,"2.1 Synthesis of γ-MoC/VN heterostructure All the chemicals were purchased from Sigma and used without purification. The V2MoO8 was synthesized by electrospinning and subsequent solid phase calcination. In brief, 0.6826 g H24Mo7N6O24·4H2O and 0.1077 g NH4VO3 were dissolved in 1 g polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and 9 g alcohol. During electrospinning, a flow rate of 1 mL/h, and a distance of 15 cm between the tip and collector was maintained under negative voltage of 18 kV over a period of time, then a white reticulation was collected and annealed at 630 °C for 6 h in air to form V2MoO8. The hybrid product of γ-MoC/V2O3 was synthesized by thermal carbonization of V2MoO8 under CO at 800 °C for 2 h, which could be further converted into heterostructure γ-MoC/VN via further nitridation of γ-MoC/V2O3 under NH3 atmosphere at 700 °C for 2 h."
3,Synthesis of γ-MoC,"2.2 Synthesis of γ-MoC The as-prepared γ-MoC/V2O3 was dispersed in 1 M HCl and stirred at 50 °C for 24 h in water bath kettle to remove the V2O3, and then, the black product of bare γ-MoC was produced via washing with deionized water for several times."
4,Synthesis of VN,"2.3 Synthesis of VN 2 mmol ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3, Sigma-Aldrich) powders were added to 39 mL of deionized water under stirring and then 1 mL of concentrated HCl (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥ 37%) was added dropwise before putting in a sealed 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. The hydrothermal reaction was carried at 200 °C for 1 h and then cooled to room temperature. The as-synthesized product was washed by deionized water several times and then freeze-dried for 48 h, which was further nitrided under NH3 at 700 °C for 2 h to produce VN."
5,Synthesis of mixture of γ-MoC and VN,2.4 Synthesis of mixture of γ-MoC and VN The mixture of γ-MoC and VN (γ-MoC + VN) was prepared by mixing γ-MoC and VN directly with a molar ratio of 1:2.
6,Materials characterization,"2.5 Materials characterization The morphology and crystal structure of the samples were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, FEI Nova 450 Nano), transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, FEI Titan G2 60–300). X-ray diffraction (XRD, Philips X’ Pert Pro) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Chemical valence analysis was performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi). The specific surface area and the pore size distributions were investigated via nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms (Micromeritics, ASAP 2020 analyzer) and the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model."
7,Electrochemical measurements,"2.6 Electrochemical measurements The HER activities of V2MoO8, γ-MoC/VN, γ-MoC/V2O3, and commercial Pt/C were evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in an electrolyte of 0.5 M H2SO4 using a three-electrode electrochemical apparatus. The graphite rod serves as the counter electrode and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. Commercial Pt/C was purchased from Sigma with 20 wt% Pt/C. All the potentials were referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the equation: E RHE = E SCE + 0.0591 × pH. The SCE also calibrated referenced to the RHE. Herein, all the potentials were converted to RHE by adding a value of 0.241 V. To prepare the working electrode, 12 mg sample was dissolved in 3 mL of deionized water under intense ultrasound for 30 min and then 5 μL of solution was loaded onto the GCE with a diameter of 3 mm and the loading density is about 0.28 mg cm−2. After drying in air, 5 μL diluted Nafion was coated on the GCE for protection. LSV, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and electrochemically active surface areas (ECSA) were measured by CHI760e at a scanning rate of 5 mV s−1, frequency range between 100 kHz and 0.1 Hz, and various scanning rates from 10 mV s−1 to 200 mV s−1, respectively. All the potentials in polarization curves were calculated by iR corrected using Rs obtained in EIS."
8,Calculation model and method,"2.7 Calculation model and method The slab models for γ-MoC, VN and heterostructured γ-MoC/VN were used in this study, with a vacuum space of 12 Å along the z direction. The (100) surface was selected for all models due to the highest coordination of surface Mo and V atoms with respect to other surfaces. Thus, a suitable H adsorption strength could be expected on these surfaces. DFT calculations were carried out with Dmol3 package in Materials Studio 8.0.[19,20] The exchange–correlation functional under the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)[21] functional and the double-numeric quality basis set with the polarization functions (DNP) were adopted in this study. The core electrons were treated with DFT semicore pseudopotentials (DSPPs). The TS method was employed to account for the dispersion corrections.[22,23] The convergence criteria of optimal configuration for energy, force and displacement were 1 × 10−5 Ha, 0.002 Ha/Å−1 and 0.005 Å, respectively. The 4 × 4 × 1 and 6 × 6 × 1 k-points mesh were used in sampling the Brillouin zone for geometry optimization and density of states calculations, respectively. The adsorption energy ΔE of H atom on the surface of substrates is defined as: ΔE = E*H – (E*+ EH) (1) where *H and * denote the adsorption of H atom on substrates and the bare substrates, EH denotes the half of energy of H2. The adsorption free energy change ΔG of the reaction is calculated as the difference between the free energies of the initial and final states as shown below: ΔG = ΔE + ΔZPE- TΔS (2) where E is the calculated energy by DFT, ZPE is the zero-point energy, S denotes the entropy. According to the work from Chhowalla M., the value of (ΔZPE- TΔS) is 0.28 eV[24] thus, ΔG = ΔE + 0.28 eV."
9,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1 a schematically presents the synthetic procedures of γ-MoC/VN. The microscale V2MoO8 particles with a size of 5 μm ( Fig. 1 b) are prepared via electrospinning method[25] and the corresponding XRD pattern reveals monoclinic V2MoO8 (PDF# 74–1510) ( Figure S1 ). After thermal treatment in CO at 800 °C for 2 h, the V2MoO8 particles are converted into porous γ-MoC/V2O3 (Fig. 1 c and Figure S2 ). The ex situ XRD patterns show that V2MoO8 begins to decompose into monoclinic MoO2 (PDF# 65–5787)[26] and hexagonal V2O3 (PDF# 34–0187)[27] under CO at 600 °C. At a higher temperature of 800 °C, the hexagonal V2O3 phase is maintained, while MoO2 is converted into hexagonal γ-MoC (PDF# 06–0546)[28–30]. Consequently, heterostructured γ-MoC and V2O3 are produced ( Figure S2 ). Owing to the difference in the density and ratio of non-metal atoms, conversion from MoO2 to γ-MoC causes volume shrinkage resulting in the formation of mesopores.[31,32] Further nitridation of γ-MoC/V2O3 under NH3 at 700 °C converts V2O3 into cubic VN (PDF#35–0768) [31,32] to produce the mesoporous γ-MoC/VN heterostructure (Fig. 1 d and Fig. 2 a). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Mo 3d and V 2p of V2MoO8, γ-MoC/V2O3 and γ-MoC/VN are depicted in Figure S3 . The Mo 3d binding energies at 232.4/235.4 eV and V 2p energies at 517/524.4 eV are associated with Mo-O and V-O of V2MoO8, respectively.[30,33] The Mo 3d peaks at 228.7/231.6 eV are associated with Mo-C in γ-MoC/V2O3 and γ-MoC/VN ( Figure S3 a).[34,35] In comparison, V-O does not change from V2MoO8 to γ-MoC/V2O3 confirming the formation of γ-MoC and V2O3 phases after thermal carbonization of V2MoO8. Upon further thermal nitridation, V-O is converted into V-N (513.7/521.0 eV) and N-V-O (515.0/522.4 eV) to produce γ-MoC/VN ( Figure S3 b). This process causes more mesopores due to volume contraction from V2O3 to VN as shown in Fig. 1 d. The specific surface areas and pore size distributions of V2MoO8, γ-MoC/V2O3 and γ-MoC/VN are determined by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods. The pristine V2MoO8 has a small BET surface area of 0.28 m2 g−1, but the surface areas of porous γ-MoC/V2O3 and γ-MoC/VN are 24.57 and 36.47 m2 g−1( Figure S4 a), respectively. The enlarged specific surface area can be attributed to the formation of mesopores by volume shrinkage from MoO2 to γ-MoC and V2O3 to VN.[36] The pore distribution of γ-MoC/V2O3 is concentrated at 3.7 nm, whereas abundant mesopores 2 nm in size are observed from γ-MoC/VN as a result of conversion from V2O3 to VN during thermal nitridation of γ-MoC/V2O3 ( Figure S4 b). TEM images of γ-MoC/V2O3 and γ-MoC/VN are displayed in Figure S5 and Fig. 2 b. Compared to the solid V2MoO8, mesopores are clearly observed from γ-MoC/V2O3 consistent with SEM image (Fig. 1 c) and BET results ( Figure S4 a). High-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) reveals lattice distances of 0.24 and 0.25 nm corresponding to V2O3 (110) and γ-MoC (101), respectively, as shown in Figure S6 . After thermal nitridation of γ-MoC/V2O3, V2O3 is converted into VN and the XRD patterns disclose crystalline γ-MoC and VN. The HR-TEM image identifies ample interfaces between γ-MoC and VN and the lattice spacings of 0.21 and 0.25 nm are ascribed to VN (200) and γ-MoC (101) (Fig. 2 c and Figure S7 ). The elemental maps of Mo, V, C, and N confirm homogeneous distributions in the γ-MoC/VN heterostructure (Fig. 2 d). All in all, the in situ constructed γ-MoC/VN heterostructure has a porous structure, large surface, and robust interface with strong electron interactions, which facilitate diffusion of ions, promote charge transfer in the heterojunctions, and optimize H adsorption/desorption in HER, thus is expected to have excellent HER performance. The HER activities of V2MoO8, γ-MoC/VN, and γ-MoC/V2O3 with an active mass loading of 0.28 mg cm−2 are evaluated by LSV at a scanning rate of 5 mV s−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 using a three-electrode electrochemical apparatus. The graphite rod serves as the counter electrode and SCE as the reference electrode. The SCE is calibrated ( Figure S8 ) and all the polarization curves are iR corrected ( Figure S9 ). Fig. 3 a-b show the polarization curves and Tafel slopes of the samples and commercial Pt/C (20 wt%). The overpotential of Pt/C is 48 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and the Tafel slope is 31.2 mV dec-1, similar to the results in the literature.[17,37] The pristine V2MoO8 shows negligible HER characteristics indicative of nearly inert HER electrocatalytic activity. However, the hybrid γ-MoC/V2O3 electrocatalyst exhibits enhanced HER activity with an overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and Tafel slope of 80.1 mV dec-1 because of the electrocatalytically active γ-MoC ( Figure S10 ). After thermal nitridation under NH3, γ-MoC/V2O3 morphs into the γ-MoC/VN hybrid electrocatalyst. We compare the HER performance of the products nitrided at 500, 600, 700 and 800 °C and the results are depicted in Figure S11 . It can be seen that the HER performance is ameliorated with the increase of nitriding temperature due to the conversion of V2O3 into VN and the samples fabricated at 700 and 800 °C exhibit the similar HER performances. Thus, γ-MoC/VN prepared at the nitridation temperature of 700 °C is used for further evaluation of HER performance. Compared to γ-MoC/V2O3, the γ-MoC/VN heterostructured electrocatalyst shows a low overpotential of 86.6 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and small Tafel slope of 47.6 mV dec-1, suggesting enhanced HER electrocatalytic activity and fast reaction kinetics. The porous structure and robust interface of γ-MoC/VN enable promising HER performance even in a solution with a wide pH ( Figure S12 ). To elucidate the origin of the high catalytic activity of γ-MoC/VN, a series of samples including γ-MoC, VN, and mixture of γ-MoC and VN (molar ratio of 1:2) are prepared ( Figure S13 and S14 ). The bare cubic VN delivers worse performance than the bare γ-MoC and mixture of γ-MoC + VN, indicating that VN in the γ-MoC/VN does not play an active role in HER. The improved HER activity of γ-MoC/VN compared to bare γ-MoC furnishes clues about the important role of the heterojunction of γ-MoC/VN which produces synergistic effects and electronic interactions ( Figure S15 ). Fig. 3 c shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results and corresponding equivalent circuits. The γ-MoC/VN electrocatalyst has a low charge transfer resistance of 47.5 Ω cm2 (measured at an overpotential of 100 mV) which is smaller than that of γ-MoC/V2O3 (362 Ω cm2) implying efficient electron transport arising from the conductive VN. Fig. 3 d discloses negligible changes in the overpotential after 10,000 cycles at a scanning rate of 200 mV s−1 and 99% voltage retention at 10 mA cm−2 for 16 h is observed, corroborating the superior HER durability of γ-MoC/VN in 0.5 M H2SO4. The stability at higher current density (60 mA cm−2) for longer time of 25 h is also tested ( Figure S16 ), and there is only 25 mV potential increase after 25 h testing, suggesting good electrochemical stability. The morphology and composition of γ-MoC/VN after the test are depicted in the Figure S17. The TEM image ( Figure S17 a) displays that the spent γ-MoC/VN catalyst still maintains pristine porous structure. The fine XPS spectra ( Figure S17 b) of Mo 3d before and after stability test reveal the presence of Mo-C peak and the Mo-O peaks is slightly increased due to the surface oxidation, further revealing the outstanding electrochemical stability of γ-MoC/VN. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) is reflected by the electrochemical double layer capacitance (Cdl) which can be derived from the CV curves in the non-Faraday range ( Figure S18 ). As shown in Fig. 3 e, Cdl of γ-MoC/VN is 11.29 mF cm−2 which is about 1.5 times larger than that of γ-MoC/V2O3, 1.6 times larger than that of γ-MoC (7.07 mF cm−2), and 250 times larger than that of VN (0.044 mF cm−2). The larger Cdl reveals more exposed active sites on γ-MoC/VN due to abundant mesopores and interfaces. The turnover frequency (TOF) of γ-MoC/VN is 0.23 s−1 at an overpotential of 200 mV, which is larger than those of γ-MoC (0.037 s−1) and VN (0.005 s−1), further revealing the excellent HER performance of γ-MoC/VN heterostructure electrocatalyst ( Figure S19 ). The HER performance of the MoC and Mo2C-based electrocatalysts and our γ-MoC/VN electrocatalyst are listed in Fig. 3 f [38–46] and Table S1 in terms of overpotentials at 10 mA cm−2 and Tafel slopes. The γ-MoC/VN electrocatalyst shows a low overpotential of 86.6 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and Tafel slope of 47.6 mV dec-1, which are superior to those of recently reported Mo2N-Mo2C/HGr-3 (157 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and 55 mV dec-1),[11] β-Mo2C@NPCC (132 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and 49 mV dec-1),[47] MoS2/Mo2C hybrid nanosheets (126 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and 53 mV dec-1),[48] WN-W2C (242 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and 85 mV dec-1), [49] and Mo2C-VC (122 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and 43.8 mV dec-1).[17] Density-functional theory (DFT) calculation and XPS are carried out to study the strong electron interactions and active centers in γ-MoC/VN. Fig. 4 a and b show the chemical states of Mo 3d and V 2p in γ-MoC/VN in comparison with γ-MoC and VN. The binding energy of Mo-C and V-N in γ-MoC/VN heterostructure shows a negative shift of 0.15 eV and positive shift of 0.2 eV in comparison with γ-MoC for VN, respectively, suggesting electron transfer from VN to adjacent Mo sites.[11] Heterostructures strengthen the electronic interactions between γ-MoC for VN to affect the HER catalytic activity. The strong electronic interaction between γ-MoC and VN is further confirmed by DFT calculation in which γ-MoC (101), VN (200), and their heterointerface are selected as the models as schematically shown in Figure S20 . The DOS of Mo atoms on MoC and γ-MoC/VN after adsorption of H is presented in Fig. 4 c. The γ-MoC/VN heterostructure shows a metallic behavior and higher Ep position (nearest peak to the Fermi Level) of DOS of Mo at the γ-MoC/VN than pure γ-MoC suggesting stronger interactions between the adsorbate and catalyst surface and enhanced conversion efficiency of H+ into H atoms.[33] The charge density difference map of γ-MoC/VN along the (101) direction of γ-MoC and VN is presented in Fig. 4 d, in which the red and blue regions represent charge accumulation and depletion, respectively. The electron density of N at the interface between γ-MoC (101) and VN (200) is mostly depleted due to transferring to neighboring atomic Mo sites. Additionally, V atoms provide partial contribution to charge accumulation at adjacent Mo atoms resulting in a smaller Mo-H binding energy at the interface.[50] The redistribution of the DOS leads to an electron donating characteristic of VN and enhanced catalytic activity of γ-MoC/VN. Fig. 4 e shows that ΔGH* of Mo-H at the heterointerface of γ-MoC/VN is −0.28 eV compared to ΔGH* of V-H in γ-MoC/VN, V-H in VN, and Mo-H in γ-MoC of −0.33, −1.12 and 0.58 eV. The optimized ΔGH* of the γ-MoC/VN heterostructured electrocatalyst enhances the HER properties. In summary, the excellent HER electrocatalytic activity and kinetics of γ-MoC/VN are attributed to the porous structure, robust interface and the strong electron interaction between γ-MoC and VN, and suitable Mo-H binding energy."
10,Conclusion,"The 3D porous γ-MoC/VN heterostructure is prepared by in situ carbonization and nitridation of monoclinic V2MoO8. The unique γ-MoC/VN heterostructured electrocatalyst delivers highly efficient and robust electrocatalytic performance in HER as manifested by a low overpotential of 86.6 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and small Tafel slope of 47.6 mV dec-1. Moreover, the γ-MoC/VN heterostructured electrocatalyst exhibits superior HER durability with negligible change in the overpotential after 10,000 cycles at a scanning rate of 200 mV s−1 and 99% voltage retention at 10 mA cm−2 for 16 h. Density-functional theory calculation and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal strong electron interactions and charge transfer between γ-MoC and VN, optimized M−H binding energy on the active sites, enhanced adsorption of H+, as well as fast conversion from H+ to H atoms, leading to significant promotion of the HER activity and kinetics. The results reveal a novel strategy to produce heterostructured catalysts and how to tailor heterostructures to optimize the electrocatalytic characteristics in electrochemical energy conversion."
