0,Introduction,"The conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into fuels and chemicals has been rigorously investigated as a response to the depletion of petroleum resources, increasing demand for oil, environmental concern over greenhouse gas emissions, and energy security [1–3]. Among the biomass derived chemicals, furfuryl alcohol (FA) is an attractive intermediate chemical for the production of levulinic acid [4], alkyl levulinate [5], and various useful polymer products [6–8]. FA can be obtained through the hydrogenation reaction of furfural and further converted into FA oligomers by the acid-catalyzed condensation reaction [9–11]. FA oligomers have been studied due to their application in fuel blending components [12] (Scheme 1 ). Buijtenen et al. have shown that after hydrogenation of FA oligomers with Ni/Al2O3, the fuel blend containing 10vol.% of these C9–C20 carbon coupled FA oligomers fulfills the European diesel specification [12]. The acid-catalyzed condensation of FA is the major source for the FA oligomerization [13,14]. Depending on the experimental conditions and method of analysis, different oligomer/polymer structures such as linear [9,15,16], cross-linked [17,18], and open ring [19] have been proposed from the results of XRD [20], NMR [15,21–23], UV–Vis [16,21,24,25], IR [16,20,21], Raman spectroscopy [8–10,13,20], and DFT calculations [9]. We have recently shown that the FA monomer can dimerize in acidic solution and two possible structures can be produced through dehydration or deprotonation reactions (Eqs. (1) and (2), the changes in free energy are given in kcal/mol) [9]. (1) (2) From the free energies formation of 2-hydroxymethyl-5(5-furfuryl)furan (HFF) is thermodynamically more favorable than 2,2′-difurfuryl ether (DFE). Even though, the formation of dimer from two FA monomers is thermodynamically favorable, because of the higher carbocation reactivity, dimer formation via the carbocation may be preferred for kinetic reasons. In addition to these two dimers, Khusnutdiv et al. reported that 2,2′-difurfurylmethane (DFM) can be also produced in the presence of the Rh(PPh3)3Cl catalyst using H2O and CCl4 as solvents [26]. The following mechanism for formation of DFM (Eq. (3)) was proposed by Sunjic et al. [27] and Korneeva et al. [28]. DFM and formaldehyde are produced through decomposition of DFE derived from the condensation of two FA monomers. (3) Using the 13C NMR spectroscopy, Choura et al. proposed a similar reaction mechanism (Eq. (4)) for the conversion of 5-methylfurfuryl alcohol (MFA) to the bis[2-(5-methylfuryl)]methane (BMFM) [15]. 2,2′-dimethylfurfuryl ether is formed first, which then decomposes into formaldehyde and BMFM. (4) Although the oligomerization of FA appears in a number of literature citations, the detailed understanding of reaction mechanisms and thermodynamics for the oligomerization processes (multiple pathways) is not available. Such an understanding will substantially enhance the utilization of FA as a platform chemical for the formation of longer chain hydrocarbons used in liquid transportation fuels. The aim of the presented study is to understand the reaction mechanism of oligomer formation and provide an accurate analysis of oligomer products. Here we have determined the product distribution of dimers (C9–C10) in detail and employed density functional theory to provide a qualitative confirmation of the experimentally observed dimer distribution trends."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalytic reaction,"2.1 Catalytic reaction FA (98%) and sulfuric acid (99.999%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. FA was mixed with dilute sulfuric acid (1M) to catalyze the production of oligomers. Initial GC/MS studies were undertaken to establish the identity of the major oligomeric species formed during the reaction (see Supporting information for the details of GC/MS experiment). Gas chromatographic analyses were performed using an Agilent 5890 Series II equipped with a flame ionization detector and a split/splitless injector. The column had dimensions of 30m×0.25mm and contained a 0.25μm film of polymethylsiloxane stationary phase. The column oven temperature was linearly programmed from 100°C to 300°C at 6°C/min after an initial hold of 4min. The carrier gas was helium, and it was controlled at a constant pressure of 20psi. The split flow was maintained at 150mL/min. An injection volume of 0.4μL was employed. Detector and injector temperatures were controlled at 250°C. Samples were prepared for analysis by dissolving 0.1g of sample into 2mL of an internal standard solution (approximately 10mg/mL 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro naphthalene in acetone). This was further diluted by addition of 2mL acetone. The response factor for FA was determined directly from the analysis of a known blend with the internal standard, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro naphthalene. Response factors for other components were estimated following an approach similar to that described by Scanlon and Willis [29]. The experimentally determined furfuryl alcohol response factor and that estimated by the Scanlon–Willis method were in close agreement. Smaller, unidentified peaks were added together and report as unidentified components. The response factor employed for these unknown components was taken as the average of the known components excluding that of furfuryl alcohol. The amount of non-eluted components (greater that the hexamer) was taken as 100% less the sum of all measured GC peaks including the unidentified components. For a batch system, the conversion, selectivity, and yield were calculated as follows: Conversion % = W FAin − W FAout / W FAin × 100 Selectivity of A % = W Aout / W FAin − W FAout × 100 where WFAin and WFAout are the masses of FA at time=0 and time t, respectively; WAout is the outlet mass of A product formed."
3,Computational methods,"2.2 Computational methods The geometries, zero-point energies, and the thermal energies were computed using the B3LYP/6-31+G(2df,p) or B3LYP/6-31+G(d) levels of theory using the Gaussian 09 software [30]. To account for the effects of an aqueous environment, calculations were also performed in water dielectric using the solvation model (SMD) at the B3LYP level of theory. FA+one water complex is optimized and used as one of the starting structure. This model is used to include at least one discrete solvent molecule in the calculation in addition to the implicit dielectric model. The geometry of the lowest energy conformers for all molecular species was chosen from our recently published papers [9,31,32]."
4,Results and discussions,
5,Acid-catalyzed oligomerization of FA,"3.1 Acid-catalyzed oligomerization of FA Oligomerization of FA was performed with an aqueous solution containing 3.00g FA and 0.03g 1M H2SO4 at 25°C and ambient pressure, as shown in Fig. 1 . During the reaction, the conversion values (mass basis) monotonically increase with increasing reaction time, and asymptotically reach ~32wt.% in 24h (Fig. 1a). Heavy oligomer (>C18) formation monotonically increases, while FA monomer (C5) wt.% decreases as a function of reaction time (Fig. 1b). It was found that up to 4h, the wt% of >C18 was similar to the C9–C15 wt.% values. After 4h, however, the wt.% of >C18 was higher than C9–C15 values and after 24h the heavier oligomers were favored significantly (>C18 =~20wt.% and C9–C15 =~10wt.%). The higher percentage of >C18 heavy oligomers in the sulfuric acid catalyzed reaction is in agreement with the observed dark (black) color of the solution, which indicates FA degradation into humins [9]. To evaluate the product distributions, we investigated the FA oligomers in more detail (Fig. 1c). Oligomers larger than hexamers (>C29) were the dominant product in >C19 oligomers, whereas tetramer to hexamer (C19–C29) were only ~1wt.% after 24h. Dimer and trimer wt.% increased with reaction time up to 8h and then leveled off. Fig. 1c shows that up to 8h, the lower (dimer+trimer) and higher molecular weight (>hexamer) oligomers are produced with similar wt.%, ~10. However, after 8h the >hexamer products are favored. Fig. 1d shows that the selectivity of FA monomer conversion into >hexamer increased with time, while the selectivity to dimers decreased with increasing reaction time. During the reaction, we observed several weak, unidentified peaks corresponding to products <hexamer (mainly <tetramer) that have been included in Fig. 1d. If we hypothesize that the unidentified peaks are various dimer, trimer, and branched short oligomers, then the highest <tetramer product yield is, evidently, favored by relatively short reaction times. Taken together, the results shown in Fig. 1a–d indicate that the dimer selectivity decreases with increasing conversion. Because short chain-length oligomers can be an important source of future bio-kerosene and diesel products, we have investigated the dimer formation from monomer. Fig. 2 shows the four types of dimers formed: methylene bridged (D1), ether bridged (D2), terminal CH2OH (D3), and internal OH (D4). The dimer formation reactions are initiated by the protonation of the FA hydroxyl group, followed by removal of water, proton, and HCHO in aqueous medium (see Eqs. (1)–(3)). The fraction of D3 dimer was initially ~50% at very short times on stream, while the fractions of D1 and D2 were lower than the D3 values. We observed very similar D1 and D2 percentages up to 24h of reaction (~20%) This is consistent with the calculated free energy values that favor the formation of D3 compared with D2 dimer. The internal OH dimer, D4, is formed in the smallest amount (~10%)."
6,Reaction mechanisms of FA oligomer formation,"3.2 Reaction mechanisms of FA oligomer formation To understand the reaction mechanism for the formation of these dimers, the enthalpies and free energies of formation were investigated and the results are shown in Fig. 3 . In the acid catalyzed reactions, furfuryl alcohol cation is the main reactive intermediate. This intermediate prefers to make chemical bonds with electron rich species such as the aromatic ring and oxygen. To understand this reactivity, we have computed detailed energetics of the FA oligomer formation in the aqueous medium. A detailed enthalpy profile is shown in Fig. 3a. The formation of FA dimer in aqueous medium is initiated by the protonation of the hydroxyl group and this process is endothermic by 10kcal/mol. If CH2 cation site of the furfuryl alcohol site binds to the aromatic ring, this will give us the major dimer (D3), which is thermodynamically and kinetically preferred product. If the cation binds to the alkoxy oxygen, this leads to the minor product D2. A 2nd FA monomer interacts with the protonated FA and a water molecule to form a stable intermediate species such as Int-D2 and Int-D3, where Int-D3 is energetically more stable than the Int-D2 by ~15kcal/mol. The formation of the minor dimer (D2) occurs via a transition state (D2-TS), requiring a reaction barrier of 11.4kcal/mol from Int-D2. The lower energy intermediate, Int-D3, transforms to D3 via a transition state, D3-TS. The computed reaction barrier for this reaction is 11.8kcal/mol from the intermediate, Int-D3. Even though both D2 and D3 are exothermic with respect to the FA monomer, the thermodynamic stability of D3 would seem to favor the formation of D3 over D2. In addition to the formation of D2, the methylene (D1) and OH-carbon bridge (D4) dimer can be formed from Int-D2 or Int-D3 and the relative energies of species are shown in Fig. 3b and c. To form the intermediate D4, the cation has to bind CH2 group, which needed to be activated by solvent or by anion (for example, chloride of the HCl or sulfate of the sulfuric acid or water). In the calculation we have used water as the base to abstract proton to activate the CH2 group, which requires high barrier (>23kcal/mol) and kinetically a minor product. Note that the formation of the precursor complex (Int-D4) itself is thermodynamically uphill. Additionally, the dehydration of D4 leads to the formation of 2,2-difuryl-ethylene (D5), which was not detected in our experimental studies. Even though the free energy profile indicates that D4 (−11.8kcal/mol) formation is thermodynamically very favorable, experimental data shows a very minor D4 production and compared to the D4 formation, quantitatively similar D1 and D2 values were obtained (see Fig. 2). Fig. 3d shows the Gibbs energy profiles of FA oligomers which contain methylene and terminal FA. The free energy values have been found to significantly favor an increasing number of furfuryl groups. Based on the free energies of dimer, trimer, tetramer and subsequent oligomers, we can conclude that as reaction time increases higher molecular oligomers will form, which is consistent the experimental results."
7,Conclusions,"In this work, we investigated the products and reaction mechanisms for the liquid-phase oligomerization of FA monomer using gas chromatography (experimental) and density functional methods (theoretical). The selectivity toward high molecular weight oligomers (>hexamer) increases with increasing reaction time. Four different kinds of dimers were observed: methylene bridged (D1), ether bridged (D2), terminal CH2OH (D3), and internal OH (D4) dimers. Theoretical studies were carried out to elucidate the dimer formation mechanisms and thermodynamic properties. In addition to the four dimers, 2,2-difuryl-ethylene formation from dehydration of the D4 dimer was indicated. Based on the experimental results, D3 is the major dimer, which is consistent with the calculated thermodynamics. These results will be useful for designing reaction conditions that favor the desired oligomer for bio-diesel/kerosene and to understand the reaction pathways."
