0,Introduction,"Solar energy is widely regarded as a free, inexhaustible and renewable source of clean energy, and the sunlight reaching the Earth’s surface on an hourly basis actually exceeds the annual global energy consumption [1,2]. However, there is always the issue of the intermittency of solar power utilization [3,4]. The production of H2 via sunlight−driven photocatalytic process represents a promising strategy to harvest solar energy [5–7]. In this process, photoinduced electrons are applied to reduce protons from hydrogen sources (eg. H2O, H2S, etc.), triggering predominant conversion from solar energy to hydrogen energy [8–10], Nevertheless, this process also generates holes that, if not involved in oxidizing the substrate, is inclined to oxidize the photocatalyst itself, resulting in diminishing solar to hydrogen energy transformation efficiency and photocorrosion of the photocatalyst [11,12]. In general, the holes can be intercepted efficiently by a sacrificial electron donor, which enables to accelerate the hydrogen evolution rate and extend the life cycle of the catalyst [13,14]. However, such processes produce undesirable by−products, and more importantly, the depletion of energy required to produce the sacrificial reagents cannot be offset by the energy harvesting from hydrogen generation [15,16]. The employment of sacrificial reagents that are produced from renewable and abundant raw materials is therefore of vital importance, and it is also necessary for them to be easily oxidized to produce value−added chemicals. In this scenario, Na2S/Na2SO3 has attracted much attention thanks to its excellent electron−donating ability and abundance of resource [17,18]. So far the highest solar−to−H2 apparent quantum efficiency of up to ∼93% at 420 nm is achieved using Na2S/Na2SO3 as the holes scavenger [19]. Furthermore, the carbon-neutrality of Na2S/Na2SO3 in contrast to other organic sacrificial reagents (eg. alcohols (methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, glycerol), lactic acid and etc.) is more attractive as building blocks for sustanble energy solution [20–22]. More importantly, Na2S/Na2SO3 oxidation during the photocatalytic reaction possesses great potential to produce Na2S2O3, a valuable product widely used as fixing agent, reducing agent and bleaching agent, etc., in the industrial activities [23–30], which is thus highly desirable to achieve simultaneous H2 evolution with value−added chemical production. However, besides Na2S2O3, other unexpeceted over−oxidative sulfur species (SO4 2−, S2O6 2−) can also be generated in the process of Na2S/Na2SO3 oxidation especially on the basic condition [30–32], which remains a barrier for the extraction of Na2S2O3 to realize the resource utilization of Na2S/Na2SO3. Herein, we present a H2S−induced product−targeting (HIPT) strategy under visible light irradiation to tackle this issue. As shown in Scheme 1 , the introduction of acidic H2S molecules favors to turn the baseic Na2S/Na2SO3 solution to a near-neutral condition so as to efficiently acquire S2O3 2− and substantially prevent over−oxidative sulfur species (SO4 2−, S2O6 2−) production (Eqs. 1,2,3,5,6) [33,34], Meanwhile, Na2S2O3 is expected to be the sole production of sulphur species after the photocatalytic process because Na2SO3 can be completely consumed by adequate H2S to form Na2S2O3 (Eqs. 4,5). This was indeed verified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Ion Chromatography (IC). Besides, the state−of−the−art performance for photocatalytic H2 production (113 mmol g−1 h−1) from H2S is realized by using a “Dual−Solid−Solution” metal sulphide heterostructure as the photocatalyst. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the conversion of Na2S/Na2SO3 into value−added chemicals coupled with robust H2 evolution via overall H2S splitting. It provides a reliable avenue for the resource utilization of sacrificial donor in various catalytic reactions. (1) HS− +2 h+ VB → H+ + S0 (2) 2S2− +2 h+ VB → S2 2− (3) SO3 2− + S2− +2 h+ VB → S2O3 2− (4) SO3 2− + 4H2S → 2HS− + 3S + 3H2O (5) S + SO3 2− → S2O3 2− (6) SO3 2− + S2 2− → S2O3 2− + S2−"

2,Synthesis of MnxCd1−xS/CdyMn1−yS (MC) composites,"2.1 Synthesis of MnxCd1−xS/CdyMn1−yS (MC) composites The composites were synthesized by a solvothermal method. In a typical procedure, x mmol CdCl2·2.5H2O, 2 − x mmol Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O and 9 mmol thioacetamide (TAA) were dissolved into 25 mL pyridine solution. The MnS/CdS composites were denoted as MC−y (y = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), meaning the molar ratio of y were 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% in total 2 mmol precursors (of total Mn and Cd sources), respectively. The obtained homogeneous solution was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon−lined stainless−steel autoclave for maintaining 18 h under 180 °C. After cooling to room temperature naturally, the suspension was centrifuged and washed several times with ultrapure water and ethanol. And then the collected precipitates were dried at 60 °C overnight in a vacuum oven. MnS and CdS were prepared through the same procedures without adding Cd or Mn sources."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The structure and crystallinity of samples were investigated by the X−ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical X’pert with Cu Kα radiation). To obtain the surface chemical composition and binding environment of the samples, the X−ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB250Xi) measurements were performed referencing to the C 1 s level at 284.8 eV. The the TEM, high resolution TEM (HRTEM) and the corresponding EDX elemental mapping were conducted to gain the mophology, microstructure and compositions of samples. The N2 adsorption−desorption isotherm and pore−size distributions were determined by the nitrogen adsorption method (Quadrasorb SI), the specific area of the samples was calculated using the Brunauer−Emmett Teller (BET) method. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP−AES, Varian ES) was used to identify the compositions of the samples. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectrum (UV–vis DRS, Shimadzu UV−2600 with an tntegratting spere) of the samples were recorded at room temperature using BaSO4 as the reflectance standard. The surface photovoltage (SPV) spectra were obtained by a TLS−SPV530 spectrometer (Zolix Instruments Co., Beijing). The contact angles were tested with a OCA25 video optical contact angle tester (Data Physics, Germany)."
4,Photocatalytic H2 evolution performance evaluations,"2.3 Photocatalytic H2 evolution performance evaluations The photocatalytic reaction was conducted in a 50 mL home−made photoreactor (Pyrex−flask). Firstly, 1.5 mg photocatalyst was introduced as suspension into 50 mL 0.1/1.5 M of Na2S/Na2SO3 mixed solution after ultrasonication for 30 min. Secondly, the reactor was de−aerated with Ar for 10 min followed by bubbling 0.15 mol H2S gas into the abovementioned solution for 3 h. Thirdly, the photoreactor was irradiated by a 300 Xenon lamp with UV cutoff filter (λ > 420 nm). The amount of evolved H2 was monitored by Shimadzu GC 2010 Plus equipped with a TCD detector, using 5 Å molecular sieve and Ar as the carrier gas. The H2 evolution rates were calculated based on H2 amount generated within the first 5 h of reaction."
5,Photocatalytic oxidation products investigations,"2.4 Photocatalytic oxidation products investigations The oxidation products were firstly systematically investigated by coupling the Infrared spectrometer (Bruker, Tensor II) and ion chromatograph (930 Compact IC Flex, Metrohm, Switzerland). Concretely, after the reaction, the solution was centrifugated under 1000 r/min for 10 min, and then 10−20 μL of the supernatant was drop−cast on KBr before pressed into pellets and conducting FT−IR test. The photocatalytic oxidation products were further determined by the IC technique. 1 μL solution after the reaction was added to 10 mL water, and then the as−obtained solution was injected into the ion chromatograph. Notably, all the tested solutions were mixed and collected after three times experiments."
6,The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE),2.5 The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) The AQE was calculated according to Eq. (7). The number of produced H2 molecules was measured by GC (Shimadzu GC−2010 Plus) and the number of incident photons was determined from the output of a monochromatic LED lamp. (7) AQY = number of reacted electrons number of incident photons ×100% = 2×number of evolved hydrogen molecules number of incident photons ×100%
7,Photoeletrochemical measurements,"2.6 Photoeletrochemical measurements The Electro−chemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), Transient photocurrent response and Mott−Schottky curve were investigated with CHI660E workstation by using Pt wire as a counter, and saturated calomel electrode as reference electrode. The working electrode with an active area of ca. 1 cm2 was prepared by a doctor blading technique (ITO, film thickness: 50 μm). The 1.2 M Na2SO3 was used as electrolyte. The EIS and Transient photocurrent response over all the samples at open circuit potential were investigated under visible−light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). LSV was conducted at a scan rate of 10 mV/s. The Mott−Schottky curves were collected at a fixed frequency of 500 and 700 Hz."
8,Density functional theory DFT calculation,"2.7 Density functional theory DFT calculation The DFT calculations were carried out using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange−correlation functional of the Perdew−Burke−Ernzerh of (PBE) type as implemented in the Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package (CASTEP) [35,36]. The cutoff energy of the plane−wave expansion was set to 400 eV. The Brillouin zone was elected with 2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst−Pack k−point grids for the structure optimizations. All geometries were adequately optimized until the convergence criteria of energy and force reached 1 × 10−5 eV and 0.02 eV/Å, respectively. The neighboring system interference along the c axis was avoided by building a vacuum space of 20 Å. The first−principles DFT simulation was carried out based on constructed crystal structures of the CdS (001) surfaces."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Photocatalytic performance evaluations,"3.1 Photocatalytic performance evaluations First, the photocatalytic overall H2S splitting using MnxCd1−xS/CdyMn1−yS (MC) as the catalysts was investigated in the Na2S/Na2SO3 solution under visible−light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). Here, the samples obtained using a simple solvothermal route at 180 ℃ for 18 h with different CdCl2 dosages are denoted as MC−y (y = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) (See Experimental Section for more detailed information). The blank experiments revealed that H2 was not found in the absence of photocatalyst or light irradiation. 1.5 M Na2SO3 and 0.1 M Na2S are applied to deliver an optimal hydrogen evolution rate (Fig. 1 a). Fig. 1 b and Fig. S1a show that all the MC composites exhibit superior H2 evolution performance as compared to the pristine MnS and CdS. A maximum H2 production rate of 113 mmol g−1 h−1 can be achieved, which is ∼170 and 24 times higher than that of MnS and CdS, respectively (Fig. 1b), outperforming most of the reported state−of−the−art photocatalysts (Table S1). The corresponding apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of MC−3 is as high as 77% at 440 nm. More importantly, the AQE complies with the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS) of MC−3, confirming the photocatalytic nature of H2 production over MC hybrids (Fig. S1b). The X−ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of MC−3 before and after the reaction corroborates the excellent photostability of the present system (Fig. S2). Despite extensive efforts, the development of photocatalytic H2S splitting systems simultaneously possessing superior H2 evolution performance and high selectivity for value−added oxidation product is still in its infancy, as several issues urgently need to be addressed. First, surface sites are susceptible to be occupied by solid S and visible light absorption shielded by the colored S2 2− [33,34,37–39], hindering the long-term stability and activity of the photocatalysts. Second, the other sulfur species such as S2O6 2− and SO4 2− are detrimental environmental effect and impedes recyclable utilization of oxidation products [33,34,37–39]. Above all, the highly selective production of value−added sulfur species is important but not eventually achievable due to the competitive generation of S, S2 2−, S2O6 2−, SO4 2−. Therefore, it is imperative to get an in−depth insight into oxidation process of H2S splitting, which could guide us to the landscape for establishing photocatalytic H2S splitting system with high activity and selectivity. In this work, the H2S oxidation process is systematically investigated using FTIR technique in combination with IC and XRD over MC−3 photocatalyst in the Na2S/Na2SO3 solution (Fig. 1c, d and Fig. S3), which could guide us to the landscape for establishing photocatalytic H2S splitting system with high activity and selectivity. The FTIR spectra reveal only the presence of S2− (1420.1 cm−1) and SO3 2− (962.1 cm−1) prior to H2S addition [40,41], suggesting the absence of chemical reaction between Na2S and Na2SO3. Nevertheless, peaks at 674.3, 999.1, 1128.7 cm−1 feature that the conversion of SO3 2− to S2O3 2− ion under H2S−assisted acidic conditions (Eq.s 4,5) can be detected upon the introduction of H2S gas [42]. Moreover, S2O3 2− species are the only products as a result of the almost consumption of SO3 2− with irradiation for 1 h or even longer (Scheme 1, Eq.s 3,5,6). To render further insights into the oxidation process of H2S splitting, IC measurements were performed, as shown in Fig. 1 d. Before irradiation, plenty of SO3 2− ions (∼86.7 %) can be chemically converted into S2O3 2−, which is consistent with the FTIR analysis. More importantly, the molar ratio of depleted SO3 2− to the resulting S2O3 2− is 4:3, which corresponds to the Eqs. 4,5. This validates the present HIPT strategy. After 1 h of illumination, ∼96.1 % SO3 2− ions are depleted. It’s noted that expanding the irradiation time more than 3 h can lead to a removal efficiency of approximate 99.9 % for SO3 2−. The above results quantitatively elaborate the anticipated overall conversion of Na2S/Na2SO3 into value−added Na2S2O3, as further confirmed by corresponding XRD test (JCPDS 25−0680) (Fig. S3). These results clearly revealed the photo−driven conversion of H2S with high activity and selectivity over MC sample in Na2S/Na2SO3 solution. To further reveal the resource conversion process of waste H2S, a series of comparative experiments were conducted. First, the photocatalytic oxidation process of Na2S/Na2SO3 over MC−3 in the absence of H2S was investigated by FTIR test. As seen in Fig. 2 a, the complex oxidation products (SO4 2−, S2O3 2−, S2O6 2−) can be simultaneously detected in the absence of H2S. Meantime, the excess SO3 2− from reaction medium was also observed [41,42]. The various S−containing species in reaction solution seriously impedes recyclable utilization of oxidation products in the absence of H2S. This result demonstrates that the presence of H2S can directionally induce the formation of photocatalytic−oxidative product S2O3 2−. Then, the amount of H2S to the effect of reaction process was also investigated and studied based on the FTIR test (Fig. 2b). The complex oxidation products (SO4 2−, S2O3 2−, S2O6 2−) can be simultaneously detected after irradiation for 5 h when the amount of H2S is equal to 25 mmol (25−H2S) [41,42]. Interestingly, the complexity of oxidation products is found to be closely related with the amount of H2S, for which the obviously descend complexity with increased H2S content. When the amount of H2S is given as 75 mmol (75−H2S), the sulfur−containing oxidation products mainly refer to the S2O3 2−, but the excess SO3 2− from reaction medium can also be observed. With further increasing the amount of H2S (150 mmol, using 150−150 mL 2–1 M HCl-Na2S solution), all of the SO3 2− are converted into S2O3 2− (Fig. 1c), which can be attributed to the introduction of acidic H2S molecules turning the basic Na2S/Na2SO3 solution to a near-neutral condition so as to efficiently obtain S2O3 2– and substantially prevent other oxidation products (SO4 2−, S2O6 2−). Meanwhile, the H2 evolution performance also exhibits a significant increase with increasing the amount of H2S (Fig. S4). However, the existence of H2S can impact the pH value of the reaction solution. So, a comparative experiment was also performed by replacing H2S with HCl and the pH was maintained within the range of 7.5–8.0 to further exclude the influence of pH values [34]. Notably, no photocatalytic H2 production was observed when the pH value was modulated by using the HCl. These results can further authenticate the rationality of the HIPT strategy for overall resource utilization of waste H2S."
11,"Structure, composition and morphology","3.2 Structure, composition and morphology For a photocatalytic process, the photocatalyst is pivotal to the superior conversion efficiency. Therefore, various characterization technologies were carried out to explore the structure−performance relationship. As shown in Fig. S5, the cubic MnS (JCPDS 06−0518) and hexagonal CdS (JCPDS 65−3413) can be indexed either in the absence of Cd or Mn precursor. For all the samples fabricated in the presence of both Cd and Mn precursors, the hexagonal CdS (JCPDS 65−3413) and hexagonal MnS (JCPDS 41−1049) phases can be simultaneously observed. Interestingly, as the Cd content increased, the diffraction peaks of MnS and CdS phases in the MC composites shifted obviously toward lower or higher angles, indicating the formation of the MnxCd1−xS and CdyMn1−yS solid solutions. The compositions of all MC samples were identified by the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP−AES) elemental analysis (Table S2). XPS analysis was conducted to verify the surface chemical states of MC hybrids (Fig. 3 a, b and Fig. S6). XPS survey spectra show the coexistence of Mn, Cd, and S (Fig. S6a). Compared with those of MnS and CdS, the binding energies of Mn 2p and Cd 3d of MC−3 are red-shifted by ∼ 1 and 0.3 eV, respectively (Fig. 3a, b). In the S 2p high−resolution spectra, two deconvoluted peaks at 161.3 and 162.4 eV (Fig. S6b) can be assigned to S2− [43,44], larger than that of MnS but smaller than CdS. These results reveal a strong interaction for MnxCd1−xS and CdyMn1−yS solid solutions [45,46], which may be attributed to the formation of heterostructure between MnxCd1−xS and CdyMn1−yS solid solutions. The XPS valence band spectra reflect a higher level of valence band maximum (VBM) for MC−3 (1.0 eV) in comparison with that of MnS (1.2 eV) and CdS (1.7 eV), which is favorable for Na2S2O3 production and for inhibiting the formation of over−oxidized products (S2O6 2− and SO4 2−) (Fig. S6c). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show that MC−3 sample is composed of nanorods and nanoparticles with intimate contact (Fig. 3c, d). Such conjunction may contribute to the slightly enhanced Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) surface area (9.4 m2 g−1) for MC−3 composite as compared to the pristine MnS (3.6 m2 g−1) and CdS (6.8 m2 g−1) (Fig. S7 and Table S3). The clear lattice fringes with spacing of 0.35 and 0.21 nm are assigned to (100) of MnxCd1−xS (MnS phase) nanorod and (110) of CdyMn1−yS (CdS phase) nanoparticle, respectively (Fig. 3e). The Energy−dispersive X−ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping images confirm the successful fabrication of “Dual−Solid−Solution” heterostructure with close interface interaction (Fig. 3f) and the corresponding composition can be expressed as Mn0.74Cd0.28S/Cd0.78Mn0.24S from the EDS elemental analysis (Fig. S8). As we know, the “Solid solution−Heterojunction” system meets the prerequisites required for an efficient photocatalytic process due to the superiority in light−harvesting−efficiency, carriers mobility and surface reaction dynamics."
12,Band structure investigations,"3.3 Band structure investigations And then, a combined analysis of the UV–vis DRS spectrum and Mott–Schottky (MS) plots was adopted to examine the electronic band alignment of MC-3 heterostructure (Fig. 4 a). The UV–vis DRS spectrum of the MC−3 composite presents typical features of individual MnxCd1−xS and CdyMn1−yS with respect band gap of 2.86 and 2.40 eV. The Mott–Schottky plots reveal p-type characteristic of both MnxCd1−xS and CdyMn1−yS owing to the negative slope of the linear plots at 0.77 and 1.01 V vs. NHE [47,48], which is accordant with the flat-band potential values (Efb) of MnxCd1−xS and CdyMn1−yS, respectively. The VBM position (EVBM) for MnxCd1−xS and CdyMn1−yS can be further estimated as 0.87 and 1.11 V, respectively, considering that Efb is about 0.1 V more positive than the VB position [49]. Correspondingly, the conduction band minimum (CBM) potential (ECBM) is obtained at −1.99 and −1.29 V, respectively. Hence, the energy band alignment can be depicted as shown in Fig. 4 b. We further applied DFT calculations to refine the electronic structures of heterostructure. In the charge transport analysis, the work function is higher for CdyMn1−yS and lower in the MnxCd1−xS (Fig. 4c, d), which allows built−in electric field to be directed from MnxCd1−xS to CdyMn1−yS [50]. Base on the above characterization we can conclude a direct Z−scheme type heterojunction between MnxCd1−xS and CdyMn1−yS (Fig. 4b). In general, the direct Z−scheme heterostructure is an ideal system for photocatalytic reaction given that the remarkable spatial separation and more energetic redox ability of photoinduced charges can be simultaneously remained. Concretely, when MC samples are excited, the photoinduced electrons in CdyMn1−yS and photoinduced holes in MnxCd1−xS would preferentially migrate to the heterojunction interface and recombine with each other due to the existence of internal electric field pointing from CdyMn1−yS to MnxCd1−xS."
13,Photocatalytic performance enhancement mechanism,"3.4 Photocatalytic performance enhancement mechanism Furthermore, the dual−solid−solution heterostructure is demonstrated to maximize the synergy effects of light absorption, spatial charge separation and surface reaction dynamics on the robust H2S splitting activity. First, all the MC samples exhibit remarkable visible-light response due to the formation of solid solutions (Fig. 5 a). Even more intriguingly, the UV–vis DRS profile of the MC−3 composite presents a dual absorption edge, which is apparently different from naked MnS and CdS, further confirming the formation of MnxCd1−xS and CdyMn1−yS. The charge carrier separation efficiency after photoexcitation was examined by surface photovoltage (SPV) test. As shown in Fig. 5b, all the MC samples exhibit an enhanced SPV response as compared to the pristine MnS and CdS, among which MC−3 exhibits the highest SPV response. Indeed, the SPV response intensity is in line with the photocatalytic activity. In addition, the carrier density (Nd) can also be calculated from the Mott−Schottky plots (Fig. 4 a and Fig. S9) using the following Eq. 8 [51]. (8) N d = 2 eε ε 0 × d 1 C 2 d V s where e is the electron charge and equal to 1.6 × 10−19 C, C is the space charge capacitance, ε is the dielectric constant of MnS (5.04) [52] and CdS (8.90) [53], the vacuum permittivity of ε0 is 8.854 × 10−14 F cm−1, and V is the applied potential on the photoanode. The calculated Nd of MnS, CdS and MC−3 are determined to be 4.26 × 107, 1.77 × 107 and 2.79 × 108 (Table S4), respectively. The high carrier density of MC−3 represents the efficient carrier separation and transfer property, which again implies that the formation of “Dual−Solid−Solution” heterostructure is in favor of charge carrier transfer and separation. Additionally, the proton reduction activity is investigated by Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) (Fig. 5c), which is also in good agreement with the photocatalytic H2 production performance. These results show that the proton reduction ability can be significantly improved through the formation of MC hybrids. The contact angle analysis in Fig. S10 denoted that the contact angle of MC−3 (18.9°) was obviously smaller than that of the MnS (130.3°) and CdS (32.1°), which is favorable for capturing H+. The DFT calculations suggest that the existence of the SO3 2− can promote the desorption of S elements from the CdyMn1−yS surface by forming S2O3 2− due to the positive adsorption energy (Eads) of S2O3 2− (0.63 eV) on the CdyMn1−yS−S surface (Fig. 5d). This result also provides a theoretical evidence endorsing the product−targeting strategy to act as an inspiring approach to ultimately convert both H2S and Na2S/Na2SO3 sacrificial reagents into the value−added Na2S2O3. On the basis of the above analysis, it is highly expected that the HIPT strategy can offer great potential for the conversion of Na2S/Na2SO3 into value−added chemicals coupled with state−of−the−art H2 evolution efficiency via overall H2S splitting. As portrayed in Scheme 1, the synergy effect of Na2S/Na2SO3 and H2S is essential for the whole process. First, the Na2S/Na2SO3 serves as electron donor to promote the H2S conversion. In the meantime, H2S enables the sole generation of Na2S2O3 in terms of inhibiting over−oxidized products production and depleting excessive Na2SO3. Finally, the application of robust and durable MC “Dual−Solid−Solution” heterostructure makes the HIPT strategy easily accessible for addressing the superiority in light harvesting−efficiency, charge carriers separation ability and surface reaction dynamics. Additionally, the Alkali Sulfide Method (2Na2S + Na2CO3 + 4SO2 → 3Na2S2O3 + CO2) and Sodium Sulfite Method (Na2SO3 + S → Na2S2O3 (110 ℃)) are two typical methods for preparing sodium thiosulfate crystals in the industrial and laboratory, respectively [54,55]. Both methods are useful to obtain Na2S2O3, but need introducing toxic SO2 gas and valuable raw material i.e. S as well as additional thermal energy, which is detrimental to the environment and may aggravate the energy crisis. In contrast, the advantages of HIPT method are intuitively seen: (i) It can be driven by abundant solar energy only and avoids providing extra energy and precious crude materials; (ii) It enables the simultaneous production of the green energy (H2) and the value-added Na2S2O3 chemical from the toxic industrial exhaust H2S gas."
14,Conclusions,"In summary, we provided a H2S-induced product−targeting approach for simultaneous H2 evolution and value−added chemicals formation using a “Dual−Solid−Solution” heterostructure. As a result, the as−architectured system exhibited a hydrogen evolution rate of 113 mmol g−1 h−1 with corresponding AQE of 77% at 440 nm, surpassing most previously reported state−of−the−art photocatalysts. Oxidation process is systematically investigated using FTIR technique in combination with IC and XRD, by which the value−added Na2S2O3 with high crystallinity is denoted as the only oxidation product. This work not only opens up a new scenario for solar energy conversion integrating with the source utilization of waste H2S and Na2S/Na2SO3 sacrificial reagents, but also provides a universal method on the design of high efficiency “Dual−Solid−Solution” heterojunction systems for sun light−driven photocatalytic reaction."
