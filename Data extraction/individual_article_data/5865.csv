0,Introduction,"The depletion of fossil fuels and environmental pollution have triggered the exploration for sustainable energy. Hydrogen is one of the promising candidates to replace fossil energy owing to its high energy density and greenhouse gas-free emission [1]. H2 produced by water electrolysis is a green and sustainable approach. Water splitting to produce high-pure hydrogen has attracted great attention, and HER as the half-reaction of water splitting have been widely reported. H2 produced from water splitting can couple with wind or solar energy (whose development are limited due to its unstable electricity generation), it is significance for future sustainable H2 supply [2,3]. The performance of electrocatalysts determine the feasibility of HER. Although Pt-based catalysts are the most active electrocatalytic for HER [4,5], the large-scale application is hindered by its high cost and scarcity [6,7]. In recent years, non-precious metal based catalysts for HER such as 3d transition metals (TMs) Fe, Co and Ni attracted many researchers’ attention owing to its low cost and abundant reserves [8–13]. Nevertheless, these 3d TMs catalysts are instable in acid electrolyte. To keep 3d TMs from corrosion, 3d TMs encapsulated by carbon shell used as HER or oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts have been widely reported [14–16]. Unfortunately, 3d TMs catalysts have relatively high overpotential than Pt-based catalysts for HER, and Pt still irreplaceable in HER due to its high catalytic activity [17]. Therefore, reducing Pt loading and improving electrocatalytic activity is important for large-scale production of HER catalysts with high activity and stability [18]. Recently, to drastically reduce Pt loading in electrocatalyst for HER, the method thus as single Pt atom anchored on grapheme [18], Pt loading on the hierarchically porous carbon [19], Pt-decorated nickel pyrophosphate [17] were used to synthesize electrocatalysts. The rational design of structure make electrocatalysts with low Pt loading perform excellent activity and stability for HER. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a common method to produce carbon nanomaterials. HER electrocatalysts synthesized by CVD have been widely reported, such as methane decomposition on Ni/CeO2 and NiCu alloy [20,21], ethanol decomposition over Co/CeO2 [22] and ethylene decomposition on ferrocene [23]. Metal confined in CNT channel used as HER catalysts have been attracted great attention, since Bao and co-workers [24] found that metal NPs confined in CNT channel showed unique electronic properties. Ni NPs encapsulated by carbon shell and supported on CNT as the HER catalyst have been rarely reported. In this work, to increase the electrical conductivity of electrocatalysts, CNT was used as the support of Ni NPs. The electrocatalysts was prepared by methane decomposition on Ni/CNT. Carbon deposited on the surface of Ni/CNT, Ni NPs was encapsulated by carbon, and the Ni@C/CNT samples were obtained. Meanwhile, Pt as the heterogeneous nucleation seed was introduced into the Ni/CNT catalyst, and loaded on CNT. The activity of these samples for HER was studied by using an electrochemical station with a typical three-electrode setup."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of Ni/CNT,"2.1 Synthesis of Ni/CNT The Ni/CNT was synthesized using the polyol reduction method, and the synthesis process described elsewhere [25]. Ethylene glycol was used as the solvent, reducing agent and protecting agent. The detail process of the catalyst preparation was as follows: 250 mg CNT was dispersed into 100 ml ethylene glycol by alternative ultrasonication and magnetic stirring. 1.2 g of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and 1 mmol of nickel nitrate hexahydrate [Ni(NO3)2•6H2O] were added into the mixture, continue ultrasonication and magnetic stirring until the solid was completely dissolved into the mixture. Then, 50 µl of chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) solution (8wt%) was also added into the mixture as the heterogeneous nucleation seed. Subsequently, the mixture was headed to 180°C and continuous magnetic stirring for 4 h in oil bath. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was filtered and washed three times with deionized water, dried at 80 °C around 12 h using an oven, finally triturated into powder and denoted as Ni/CNT. The nominal content of Ni and Pt in the catalyst was fixed around 20.0 and 0.6wt%, respectively. For comparison, the samples of pure nickel supported on CNT (chloroplatinic acid solution was not added into precursor solution) and pure platinum supported on CNT (nickel nitrate hexahydrate was not added into precursor solution) were also prepared, the prepared samples were denoted as “only Ni” and “only Pt”, respectively."
3,Synthesis of Ni@C-x electrocatalysts,"2.2 Synthesis of Ni@C-x electrocatalysts 100 mg of Ni/CNT was placed into the midsection of a quartz tubular reactor, before heating, the system was flushed by N2 to remove the air. The catalyst was heated to 800°C with flow of N2 at 45 ml/min, then, 5 ml/min of CH4 was also added into tubular reactor. Methane decomposed on the Ni/CNT catalysts, the solid products from methane decomposition with 10, 20 and 30 min were obtained, and denoted as Ni@C-10, Ni@C-20 and Ni@C-30, respectively. After cooling to room temperature, Ni@C-x samples were immersed 0.1 M H2SO4 for 2 h to etch off the redundant metallic Ni NPs. Finally, Ni@C-x samples have been washed with deionized water and filtered three times, then, dried at 60°C for 12 h. The obtained Ni@C-x samples were triturated into powder. For comparison, we also synthesized “pure Ni@C-10″, which was obtained by methane decomposed on “pure Ni” for 10 min."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The powder XRD (x-ray diffraction) using a Bruker AXS D8 Advance X-Ray Diffractometer instrument (40 kV, 100 mA) with Cu/Kα X-ray source in the scanning range of 10 to 80° with a scan rate of 0.1°/s, and at room temperature. Raman spectra of carbon product and catalysts were recorded by a JOBIN YVON Aramis Raman spectrometer from HORIBA scientific with 532 nm solid laser as an excitation source. XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) spectra of samples were studied by a Shimadzu AXIS-Ultra DLD spectrometer with an Al Kα X-ray source. TEM (transmission electron microscope) images of samples were recorded with a JEM-2100F electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. The actual composition in the Ni@C-10 was determined by a ThermoFisher iCAPQ inductively coupled plasma- mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) analysis."
5,Electrochemical measurements,"2.4 Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical activities of samples were investigated by using a CS350H (Wuhan, corrtest instruments Co.) electrochemical workstation with a typical three-electrode setup. A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and graphite rod were used as reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. All electrocatalysts were fabricated follow steps: 10 mg samples dispersed in deionized water (350 µl), anhydrous alcohol (700 µl) and 5wt% Nafion solution (80 µl), then ultrasonic dispersion for at least 40 min. 7 µl catalyst ink was loaded on glassy carbon electrode (with a 3 mm diameter and polished to a mirror-finishing before loading the catalyst ink), dried at room temperature, it was used as the working electrode (the catalyst loading was 876 µg cm−2 and Pt loading was 4.3 µg cm−2). The electrolyte was 0.1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution, the overpotential of SCE was converted to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE): E (RHE) = E (SCE) + 0.241 + 0.059*pH."
6,Results and discussion,"The Ni@C-x (x stand for the time of methane decomposition) catalysts were fabricated through a two-step strategy, illustrated in Fig. 1 . Firstly, Ni and Pt cations deposited on the surface of CNT, and been reduced in ethylene glycol. Secondly, the Ni/CNT was used as the catalyst for methane decomposition, and Ni@C-x were obtained. Figs. 2 , S1 and S3 (supporting materials) show the TEM images of the Ni/CNT, Ni@C-10, Ni@C-20 and Ni@C-30. Fig. 2(a, b, c), (d, e, f) and (g, h, i) reveal the microstructure of as-prepared Ni/CNT, Ni@C-10 and Ni@C-30, respectively. TEM images indicate that Ni NPs before and after catalytic decomposition of methane were loaded on CNTs. Ni NPs in Ni/CNT were aggregated (as seen in Fig. 2a), and it became more dispersed after methane decomposition (as seen in Fig. 2d and g). Ni NPs in Ni/CNT were exposed and carbon shell was not observed, showed by Figs. 2c, S1 (a, b) (supporting materials). Metal NPs encapsulated by carbon shell have been proved to be high activity and stability for HER, and the HER activity was highly dependent on the thickness of carbon shell, fewer-layer carbon shell are more efficient to improve HER activity [21,26]. After catalytic decomposition of methane, carbon shell formed and encapsulated Ni NPs. Fig. 2 (e,h), Fig. S1 (c, d, e, g) and Fig. S3(c, d) (supporting materials) clearly reveal the presence of onion-like carbon which encapsulate the Ni NPs in Ni@C-10, Ni@C-20 and Ni@C-30. Fig. 2f presents the Ni@C and CNT connected by several carbon layers, and above 1~2 layers carbon shell encapsulate Ni NPs in Ni@C-10. Fig. S3c shows that 2~3 layers carbon shell encapsulate Ni NPs in Ni@C-20, Fig. 2i shows that above 3 layers carbon shell encapsulate Ni NPs in Ni@C-30. Indicating the number of graphite layers increase with increasing the reaction time of methane decomposition. Notably, Pt as heterogeneous nucleation seeds was introduced into samples, and Pt NPs was clearly observed in Ni@C-30. Fig. S1f shows the Pt NPs exist around Ni NPs. Fig. S2 (supporting materials) shows the HRTEM images of Pt NPs in Ni@C-30. Obviously, Pt NPs supported on CNTs with ultrafine size 2~3 nm were well dispersed, and the lattice fringes with a spacing value of 0.22 nm can be assigned to Pt (111) plane [27–29]. As can be seen from TEM images of Ni@C-x, carbon-encapsulated Ni NPs and Pt NPs were supported on the surface of CNT. The Ni and Pt content in synthesized Ni@C-10, Ni@C-20 and Ni@C-30 were measured to be 22.70wt% and 0.49wt%, 21.64wt% and 0.48wt%, 21.59wt% and 0.48wt%, respectively, according to ICP-MS results. Fig. 3 a shows the XRD patterns of Ni/CNT and the Ni@C-x samples. The characteristic diffraction peak centered at the 2θ value of 25.3° can be attributed to the graphitic (002) crystal planes of the CNT support. The peaks of 2θ values of 44.5°, 51.3° and 75.9° are assigned to the (111), (200) and (220) planes of metallic Ni0 (PDF #04–0850), respectively. The intensity of Ni peaks became stronger after methane decomposition over Ni/CNT, and it increased with increasing time of methane decomposition. It was indicated that the crystallinity of Ni was enhanced after methane decomposition, due to better dispersion of Ni NPs than that of Ni/CNT. As a comparison, the XRD patterns of “only Ni” and “only Pt” are displayed in Fig. S4 (supporting materials), the diffraction peaks of C (002) and C (100) appeared in XRD spectra. In the XRD pattern of “only Ni”, the diffraction peak at 2θ value of 33.6° can be attributed to the planes (100) of hexagonal compact β-Ni(OH)2, and the diffraction peak at 60° was assigned to nickel hydroxide [30,31], indicating the necessity of chloroplatinic acid solution to the formation of crystalline nickel. The characteristic diffraction peaks of Pt was not observed in these (Ni/CNT, Ni@C-x and “only Pt”) XRD patterns as a result of XRD instrument detection limited, due to the low loading, good dispersion and small particle size of Pt NPs [32], but ICP-MS and TEM results proved the existence of Pt (see Fig. S2) (supporting materials). Fig. 3b shows the Raman spectra of the samples. Three obvious bands centered around 1347, 1567 and 2674 cm−1 was attributed to the D, G and 2D peaks respectively. The D band was related to the defects and impurities in graphite structure [33], and the G band was associated with ordered graphite [34]. The ratios of IG/ID were calculated to be 1.17, 1.26, 1.34 and 1.54 for Ni/CNT, Ni@C-10, Ni@C-20 and Ni@C-30, respectively. The IG/ID values increase with increasing time of methane decomposition, indicating the increase of ordered graphite, which confirmed by TEM images (Fig. 2f and i). After carbon deposited on Ni NPs, both D and G band peaks shift to a lower wavenumber. The intensity of 2D band increases after methane decomposition over Ni/CNT, and it increase with increasing time of methane decomposition. Fig. 3c displays the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results of samples. The existence of C, O, Ni and Pt elements was identified by XPS spectra. The composition in surface of the samples was calculated. The atomic ratios of C/O/Ni were calculated to be 89.95/7.45/2.60, 96.8/2.44/0.77, 95.92/3.01/1.07 and 96.29/2.52/1.19 for Ni/CNT, Ni@C-10, Ni@C-20 and Ni@C-30, respectively. After catalytic decomposition of methane, the atomic ratio of C and Ni in the surface of Ni@C-10 increased and decreased, respectively, due to the formation of the carbon shell and it encapsulated Ni NPs. Notably, the fraction of Ni atoms in the surface of Ni@C-10 was the lowest, indicating most Ni NPs have been confined by carbon shell. The ratio of Ni atoms in the surface of Ni@C-20 and Ni@C-30 increased slightly compared with Ni@C-10, it may attributed to that a small amount of fresh Ni NPs were exposed after continuous catalytic decomposition of methane. In addition, O element was also detected, it may be attributed to the slightly oxidation or the adsorbed oxygen. After catalytic decomposition of methane, the atomic ratio of O in Ni@C-x samples decreased, because the oxides were reduced by methane. High-resolution XPS spectra are shown in Fig. S5 (supporting materials), all spectra were corrected by the C 1 s signal (located at 284.8 eV). The XPS spectra of Ni 2p contain two doublets of 1/2 and 3/2, and each Ni 2p peak can be deconvoluted into two pair of doublets, representing the Ni 2p and shake-up peaks. The binding energies of Ni 2p1/2 were 874.1, 872.8, 872.4 and 872.6 eV, while Ni 2p3/2 were 856.4, 853.8, 854.4 and 854.2 eV for Ni/CNT, Ni@C-10, Ni@C-20, Ni@C-30, respectively. The Ni 2p1/2 and Ni 2p3/2 peaks of Ni@C-x both shift to lower binding energy relative to the Ni 2p1/2 and Ni 2p3/2 peaks of Ni/CNT. The changes of Ni binding energy probably as a result of the charge transfer from nickel to carbon atoms nearby. In addition, the doublets of Pt 4f5/2 and Pt 4f7/2 were also observed, the binding energies of Pt 4f5/2 were 74.3 and 74.7 eV, while Pt 4f7/2 were 71.3 and 71.9 eV for Ni/CNT and Ni@C-x, respectively. The Pt 4f5/2 and Pt 4f7/2 peaks of Ni@C-x both shifted to higher binding energy relative to the Pt 4f5/2 and Pt 4f7/2 peaks of Ni/CNT, and these values were higher than the pure Pt0 (74.5 and 71.2 eV for 4f5/2 and 4f7/2) [35]. Pt NPs with partially positive charge indicating that the electronic structure of Pt is clearly modified by Ni@C/CNT. In addition, it probably means the formation of a heterojunction-like interaction between Pt and Ni@C, which benefits the catalyst stability for HER [35,36]. An additional peak appeared at low binding energy region around 68.6 and 67.6 eV for Ni/CNT and Ni@C-x, respectively, can be assigned to the Ni 3p species. The Ni 3p peak of Ni@C-x also shifted to lower binding energy relative to the Ni 3p peak of Ni/CNT. The electrochemical measurement is displayed in Fig. 4 . The HER activity of samples and commercial 20wt% Pt/C were evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) with a scan rate of 1 mV/s, investigated in 0.1 M H2SO4 using a typical three-electrode setup. Fig. 4a shows the LSV curves of samples and Pt/C. Notably, Ni@C-10 showed superior activity, to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the overpotential of 40 mV was required, which was better than 19 mV of commercial 20wt% Pt/C, the required overpotential of Pt/C at current density of 10 mA cm−2 was 59 mV. The LSV curves of Ni@C-10 and Pt/C was also shown in Fig. S7 (supporting materials). Ni@C-20 also showed a lower potential than Pt/C at current density of 10 mA cm−2 (54 mV). Ni@C-30 shows the worse HER activity, the overpotential of 72 mV was required to support 10 mA cm−2 current density. Besides, Ni/CNT shows higher HER activity than Ni@C-30, 61 mV was required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2. But Ni/CNT perform a weak stability, after 1000 cyclic voltammetry between −0.18 and +0.77 V (vs RHE), to support a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the required overpotential increased from 61 to 274 mV shown in Fig. S8 (supporting materials). The reduced HER activity for Ni/CNT may be attributed to the corrosion of Ni NPs by H2SO4 aqueous, because Ni NPs was not encapsulated by carbon shell and naked Ni NPs are easy to be corroded in acidic media. Fig. 4b shows the LSV curves of “only Pt” and “only Ni”. “Only Ni” shows very poor activity for HER, because of the absence of crystalline nickel and Pt particles, which are essential to catalyze HER. “Only Pt” performed satisfactory HER activity in the first polarization, but the polarization curves shift negatively. To obtain a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the required overpotential increases from 64 (1st polarization) to 145 mV (2st polarization). Suggesting Pt supported on CNT without Ni NPs shows terrible HER stability. With the Ni NPs added into CNT, such as Ni/CNT, HER stability improved greatly (showed by Figs. 4b and S8). Fig. S6 shows the LSV curves of “pure Ni@C-10″, 300 mV was required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The LSV curves of Ni/CNT, “only Ni”, “only Pt” and “pure Ni@C-10″indicated that the addition of Pt greatly improve catalyst activity for HER, and the addition of Ni improve catalyst stability for HER. Fig. 4c shows the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) of samples. The values of Cdl were calculated from cyclic voltammetry curves (Cdl = j0.15/v, j0.15 represent the current density at the voltage of 0.15 V and v is the scan rate). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of samples at different scan rates in the non-Faradaic region (from 0.1 to 0.2 V vs. RHE ) were shown in Fig. S9 (supporting materials). Ni/CNT, Ni@C-20, Ni@C-30 and “only Pt” showed Cdl values of 10.9, 10.1, 10.9 and 10.6 mF cm−2, respectively. Ni@C-10 showed the highest Cdl values of 12.9 mF cm−2, and “only Ni” showed the lowest Cdl values of 2.3 mF cm−2. A large Cdl value implies a high active-sites and the amount of absorbed protons, which is benefit for proton exchangeability between electrocatalysts and electrolyte, accordingly, perform a higher HER activity [27,37]. To realize the reaction mechanism of HER occurred over as-prepared catalysts and commercial 20wt% Pt/C in acidic aqueous solution, Tafel slopes derived from polarization curves were obtained, and it can explicate possible elementary steps in HER process. It is well known that smaller Tafel slopes correspond to faster electrode kinetics in HER and larger increase in the current density under a smaller overpotential increase [38]. Fig. 4d shows the Tafel slopes of samples and Pt/C, the Tafel slopes were calculated as 35.1, 31.7, 43.5, 37.6 and 29.3 mV dec−1 for Ni/CNT, Ni@C-10, Ni@C-20, Ni@C-30 and Pt/C, respectively. Ni@C-10 showed a Tafel slope of 31.7 mV dec−1, which was closed to the tafel slope of Pt/C (29.3 mV dec−1). The typical HER process involves three steps according different Tafel slopes, including electrochemical discharge step (Volmer reaction: H3O+ + e − → Hads +H2O, tafel slope value is 120 mV dec−1), electrochemical desorption step (Heyrovsky reaction: Hads + H3O+ +e − → H2 + H2O, tafel slope value is 40 mV dec−1) and chemical recombination step (Tafel reaction: Hads + Hads → H2, tafel slope value is 30 mV dec−1) [39]. These results reveal that both Ni@C-10 and Pt/C present high catalytic performance and favorable kinetics for HER. The Tafel slopes of Ni@C-10 and Pt/C electrodes are nearly the same, suggesting that Ni@C-10 and Pt/C catalyze the HER via a Volmer-Tafel mechanism, in which recombination of absorbed H is the rate-limiting step [40]. The Tafel slopes of Ni/CNT, Ni@C-20 and Ni@C-30 electrodes are in the range of 35–45 mV dec−1, suggesting a possible Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism, in which desorption is the rate-limiting step [41]. The activities of samples and Pt/C for HER could be further reflected by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), the EIS tests for HER were carried out at the potential −30 mV (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Fig. 4e shows the Nyquist plots of the catalysts. The series resistance (Rs) related to the resistance of the electrolyte and all contacts, and the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) between the catalysts and electrolyte. Both of Rs and Rct can be determined by the Nyquist plots. The Pt/C, Ni/CNT, Ni@C-10, Ni@C-20 and Ni@C-30 possess Rs values of 27.6, 30.4, 24.4, 32 and 29.4 Ω, and Rct values of 4.3, 5.3, 4.6, 7.51, 29.2 Ω, respectively. Ni@C-10 showed the lowest Rs value and a low Rct value closed to those of Pt/C, which suggest an outstanding HER activity of Ni@CNT-10. Notably, the Rct values of Ni@C-x follow the sequence of Ni@C-10<Ni@C-20<Ni@C-30, indicating that Rct values of Ni@C-x increase with increasing time of methane decomposition. This could be explained from the harder electron transport between active sites and electrolyte at the thicker graphitic layers [21]. Considering Ni nanoparticles are unstable in harsh condition, durability is a critical factor to evaluated catalyst property. To estimate catalytic stability of Ni@C-10 and Pt/C, the electrode loading with Ni@C-10 and Pt/C are tested by cyclic voltammetry between −0.18 to 0.77 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Fig. 4f displays the first polarization curves of Ni@C-10 and Pt/C, and its polarization curves after 2000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry. Ni@C-10 performed negligible potential shifts, while Pt/C presented obvious deteriorates. After 2000 cyclic voltammetry sweep, to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the required overpotential of Ni@C-10 and Pt/C increased 1 and 11 mV, respectively. To obtaine a current density of 50 mA cm−2, the required overpotential of Ni@C-10 and Pt/C increased 3 and 42 mV, respectively. These results indicate that Ni@C-10 have higher cyclic voltammetry stability than that of 20wt% Pt/C, although with much lower Pt content than 20wt% Pt/C. The excellent stability of Ni@C-10 may be attributed to Ni NPs encapsulated by carbon shell and the formation of heterojunction-like interaction between Pt and Ni@C/CNT. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to further understand the HER activity of samples. The results were calculated by using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) [42] within the DFT framework as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [43].We have established a series of models, include Ni40 NPs, Ni6 NPs, Ni6 NPs loaded on CNT (Ni6/CNT) and Ni6@C loaded on CNT (Ni6@C/CNT), shown in Fig. S10–14 (supporting materials). For H* adsorption on Ni6@C/CNT, two sites were considered, the Ni6@C/CNT with the H* adsorption site away from the CNT (Ni6@C/CNT-ortho) and the Ni6@C/CNT with the H* adsorption site near the CNT (Ni6@C/CNT-para). The Gibbs free energy for H* adsorption [∆G(H*)] is closely related to HER activity, a catalyst with a moderate ∆G(H*) value can compromise the reaction barriers of the adsorption and desorption steps, which is beneficial for HER process. As can be seen from Fig. 5 , Ni40 exhibits the lowest adsorption energy of −0.56 eV. Besides, we also calculated the ∆G(H*) value of Ni6/CNT, Ni6@CNT, Ni6@C/CNT-ortho and Ni6@C/CNT-para. Ni6/CNT shows a relative weak H* adsorption of −0.36 eV, compared with Ni40. Manifesting Ni NPs loaded on CNT can decrease the adsorption energy of H*. The ∆G(H*) value of Ni6@CNT, Ni6@C/CNT-ortho and Ni6@C/CNT-para are 0.27, 0.18 and 0.24 eV, respectively. Ni NPs confined in CNT channel and Ni NPs confined in carbon shell and supported on CNT are two deferent strategy of metal encapsulate in carbon materials. Ni6@C/CNT exhibit smaller ∆G(H*) value than Ni6@CNT, manifesting Ni NPs confined in carbon shell and supported on CNT can perform higher HER activity than that of Ni NPs confined in CNT directly. Furthermore, our calculation suggested that the H* adsorption site also can affect the ∆G(H*) value of Ni6@C/CNT, it may be attributed to the existence of CNT."
