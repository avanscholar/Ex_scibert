0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a clean energy source, which can be used for a highly-efficient generation of electricity through fuel cell systems. At present, steam reforming of non-renewable fossil-based feedstocks –essentially natural gas– is the technology most commonly used, but this neglects the follow-up costs of the environmental impact (Fatsikostas and Verykios, 2004; Ramirez de la Piscina and Homs, 2009). Recently, hydrogen production from renewable sources such as bio-ethanol, glycerol or dimethyl ether has attracted significant attention as a means to support sustainable energy development (Cai et al., 2008; Dou et al., 2010; Gayubo et al., 2004; He et al., 2010; Rogatis et al., 2008; Slinn et al., 2008; Wu and Kawi, 2010). The implementation of new processes for producing other bioresource-derived substrates and the development of biorefineries are opening up new possibilities for H2 production from renewable feedstock. In this context, butanol has been proposed as a model that is representative compound of the alcohols present in bio-oils (Bimbela et al., 2009; Nahar and Madhani, 2010). Moreover, n-butanol can be produced by fermentation from sugar beet, sugar cane, corn, wheat and potentially lignocellulosic biomass (Marchal et al., 1992; Qureshi et al., 2008), and recently, BP and DuPont announced that they would market n-butanol, called bio-butanol in the UK (Hess, 2006). In comparison with other substrates (e.g. ethanol and methanol), n-butanol exhibits a series of advantages, including higher hydrogen content (13.51wt.%) than ethanol (13.04wt.%) or methanol (12.5wt.%); lower vapor pressure and greater tolerance to water; and furthermore, n-butanol can be used directly in existing fuel distribution pipelines (Wang and Cao, 2010). These reasons, together with the few published reports of steam-reforming of butanol (Bimbela et al., 2009; Nahar and Madhani, 2010) led us to study the process in which up to 12mol of H2 can be obtained from 1mol of butanol reacting with H2O: (1) C 4 H 10 O + 3 H 2 O → 4 CO + 8 H 2 (2) C 4 H 10 O + 7 H 2 O → 4 CO 2 + 12 H 2 The implementation of H2 production by the reformation processes associated with bioresource-derived butanol, can involve reforming of the preliminary distillation of the fermentation liquid in order to avoid processes that demand excessive energy; this raw material is a mixture of butanol, acetone, ethanol (approximately 6:3:1 mass ratio) and water (approximately 60wt.%). Hereinafter this liquid is called the raw mixture. The aim of this work, is to analyze the use of supported Co-based catalysts, in the steam reforming of both butanol and the bioresource-derived butanol mixture (butanol:acetone:ethanol 6:3:1 mass ratio). To our knowledge, there are no studies of the steam reforming of this raw mixture. We chose cobalt-based systems as catalysts because cobalt has been shown to be an appropriate active phase for steam reforming of higher alcohols, including ethanol and glycerol, and to have a considerable capacity for C–C bond cleavage (Ramírez de la Piscina and Homs, 2008). Moreover, since the support may play a major role in the performance of Co-based catalysts (Karim et al., 2010; Kim and Lee, 2010; Llorca et al., 2001; Ramírez de la Piscina and Homs, 2008), three supports with different acid–base and redox properties (ZnO, CeO2, and TiO2) were used. Finally, we also studied the effect of addition of Ir to the catalysts because previous studies indicated a beneficial effect on the catalytic performance of Co-based catalysts for alcohol reforming processes when several noble metals were added (Brum Pereira et al., 2008, 2010, 2011; Profeti et al., 2008). Small amounts of Pd, Pt, Rh, Ir or Ru added to Co/Al2O3 modified its catalytic behavior in the steam reforming of ethanol and favoured the cobalt reducibility (Profeti et al., 2008). The enhancement of reducibility of cobalt was related to the improvement in catalytic performance because the cobalt active sites were less susceptible to the deactivation process by reoxidation during the reforming reaction (Profeti et al., 2008). Other studies showed that the addition of Rh or Ru to cobalt-based catalysts also had a positive effect on their stability and catalytic performance in the oxidative steam-reforming of ethanol (Brum Pereira et al., 2008, 2010, 2011)."
1,Methods,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts The following oxides purchased from TECNAN were used: TiO2 (120m2/g), CeO2 (120m2/g), ZnO (41m2/g). Catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using aqueous solutions of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and/or IrCl3 to obtain catalysts with 7wt.% Co and/or 1wt.% Ir. The impregnated samples were dried at 70°C overnight and then calcined at 600°C in air for 5h. The following monometallic cobalt catalysts were prepared: Co/TiO2 (49m2/g), Co/CeO2 (67m2/g) and Co/ZnO (14m2/g). Co–Ir/ZnO and Ir/ZnO catalysts were also prepared, in order to study the effect of Ir addition on Co/ZnO."
3,Characterization of catalysts,2.2 Characterization of catalysts The metallic content of catalysts was determined by optical emission spectroscopy with inductively coupled plasma using a Perkin Elmer Optima 3200 RL equipment. The BET surface-area of the catalysts was determined by N2 adsorption using a Tristar-3000 Micromeritics apparatus; samples were degassed at 200°C for 4h before the surface-area was measured. Raman spectra were recorded using a Jobin-Yvon T64000 spectrometer with an Ar ion laser as the illumination source (532.08nm) and a CCD detector cooled at −196°C. The Raman spectra of the catalysts were collected with the laser power limited to 0.7mV to minimize laser-heating effects. Thermal gravimetric analyses were recorded using a SenSysevo (SETARAM) equipment. 20mg of the samples were placed in an alumina cell and heated under air (40mL/min) from room temperature up to 800°C (10°C/min). The carbon deposition occurring during catalytic testing was also investigated by temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) using a Micromeritics AutoChem II analyzer equipped with a continuous-flow fixed-bed quartz reactor. Forty milligram of the used catalysts were heated (10°C/min) from room temperature up to 820°C under a 10% v/v O2/He flow and the oxygen consumption was measured by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests Catalytic reforming tests were carried out in a Microactivity-Reference unit (PID Eng&TECH). The catalyst was mixed with inactive SiC (Prolabo, 0.5mm) and placed in a tubular fixed-bed reactor (305mm long, 9mm i.d., 316-L stainless steel) up to a catalytic volume of approximately 1mL. The temperature was measured using a thermocouple in direct contact with the catalytic bed. Before the reaction, the catalyst was activated under a H2/Ar mixture at 450°C for 1.5h (50mL/min, 10vol.% H2 mixture). A piston pump was used to introduce the liquid mixture, which was then vaporized and mixed with a controlled flow of dilution gas (Ar). The catalytic reaction was followed at reaction temperatures of 500°C, 550°C and 600°C, and the products were analyzed on-line with a Varian 450-GC equipped with TCD, FID and mass spectrometer detectors."
5,Results and discussion,"Table 1 presents the results of the steam reforming of pure n-butanol over monometallic cobalt catalysts. In all cases, both butanol conversion and hydrogen concentration progressively increased with temperature and the butanol conversion reached 100% at 600°C after 6h on stream; under these conditions only H2, CO2, CO, and CH4 were produced. As regards the dry outlet gas composition, a decrease in CO2 and methane concentrations was observed with increasing temperature, which is related with the endothermic nature of both the steam reforming of methane and the reverse water gas shift reaction (Nahar and Madhani, 2010). Co/ZnO exhibited the best catalytic performance; better than both Co/TiO2 and Co/CeO2, in terms of both the H2 richness of the outlet gas, and butanol conversion at temperatures lower than 600°C. Moreover, at 600°C, after 36h on-stream, butanol conversion remained 100% over Co/ZnO but it decreased to approximately 98% and 94% over Co/CeO2 and Co/TiO2, respectively (Table 1). Simultaneously with the diminution in butanol conversion over time, over Co/CeO2 and Co/TiO2 the hydrogen yield declined and methane formation increased. ZnO, CeO2 and TiO2 supports were tested in the butanol steam-reforming under similar reaction conditions; catalytic results are compiled in Table 2 . All oxides were active and the butanol conversion increased with an increase of temperature. However, conversion values reached were much lower than that of the corresponding Co-containing catalyst. This makes the comparison of selectivity values difficult. Besides H2, CO, CO2, and CH4, variable amounts of ethylene, butene and butanal were found, being the latest the main by-product. The characterization of fresh Co/ZnO, Co/CeO2 and Co/TiO2 by XRD pointed out, in all cases, the presence of crystalline Co3O4 particles with a similar size; sizes in the range 11–13nm were determined using the Scherrer equation. After the catalytic tests, no XRD peaks characteristic of Co3O4 were found and in all cases only the presence of Cofcc was determined as cobalt-containing phase; the size of Cofcc particles was 12–13nm. As stated above, the catalytic test did not allow us to determine whether Co/ZnO deactivation took place. However, we analyzed the carbon deposition during the experiment because it is considered to be the main cause of Co-based catalyst deactivation in the steam reforming of alcohols (Song and Ozkan, 2009). Carbon deposits on the monometallic cobalt catalysts were examined by thermogravimetry (TG) under oxidative conditions. Derivative DTG profiles of all samples exhibited a main peak of oxidation with minima in the range 500–550°C, which was mainly ascribed to the oxidation of coke deposits over the cobalt surface (Gelleti et al., 2008). However, there were several differences in the DTG profiles, the Co/ZnO sample presented the lowest oxidation temperature (peak minimum at approximately 506°C) and Co/TiO2 showed the most complex DTG profile. Besides the main oxidation peak with a minimum at 525°C, Co/TiO2 presented two shoulders positioned at 370°C and 600°C. The first is attributed to adsorbed reactants or intermediates due to incomplete conversion of the butanol (see Table 1) and the second (above 600°C) corresponds to more ordered carbon deposits. The total weight loss after TG analysis was 9.1wt.%, 12.4wt.%, and 28.1wt.%, for Co/ZnO, Co/CeO2 and Co/TiO2, respectively. During the TG experiment a maximum weight gain of 2.3wt.% would be expected if all the cobalt were oxidized to Co3O4. Therefore, the relative amount of carbon deposited during the catalytic test was in the following order: Co/ZnO<Co/CeO2 <Co/TiO2. Co/TiO2 showed the highest amount of deposited carbon and exhibited the highest CH4 concentration in the outlet gas during the catalytic reaction. If CH4 is formed by butanol decomposition (Nahar and Madhani, 2010), then simultaneously C formation can be inferred: (3) C 4 H 10 O → CO + 2 CH 4 + H 2 + C However, other processes can contribute to the formation of C or CH4. CH4 can be formed by CO, CO2 and C hydrogenation, and it could be then consumed by steam reforming (Nahar and Madhani, 2010; Ramírez de la Piscina and Homs, 2008). For a better characterization of the carbon deposits, samples were further analyzed by Raman spectroscopy after the catalytic tests. Two characteristic bands of carbon deposits at approximately 1350cm−1 (D) and 1600cm−1 (G) were clearly visible in the spectra of Co/CeO2 and Co/TiO2; the intensity of the bands in the Co/ZnO spectrum was much lower in agreement with the smaller amount of carbon deposited as determined by TG experiments for this catalyst. The origin of the D band is ascribed to the structural imperfection of graphite, and the G band corresponds to the in-plane carbon–carbon stretching vibrations (E 2g) of the graphite layers; this band is located at 1582cm−1 when graphitic deposits are present. For disordered deposits, a new band in the range 1600–1620cm−1 appears, usually as a shoulder of the main G band. In this respect, the greater width of the G band (Δυ has been related with the presence of more disordered carbonaceous deposits (Lespade and Marchand, 1984). Moreover, the graphitization of carbonaceous deposits is accompanied by an increase in the ratio of the area of the G band to that of the D band (I G/I D) (Lespade and Marchand, 1984; Li et al., 2006). The I G/I D values calculated by curve fitting of the Raman spectra increased from 0.68 (Co/ZnO) to 0.76 (Co/CeO2) and 0.85 (Co/TiO2), indicating that the crystalline order of the deposited carbon increased as follows: Co/ZnO<Co/CeO2 <Co/TiO2. This agrees with the DTG results discussed above. Moreover, Co/ZnO showed the widest G band, as expected for the most disordered carbonaceous deposits; and the υE 2g value corresponding to Co/TiO2 was the lowest, as expected for the most ordered carbon deposits. These results indicate that the Co/ZnO catalyst is more suitable than Co/CeO2 or Co/TiO2 for the steam reforming of pure n-butanol. We selected this catalyst to carry out the reforming of the raw bioresource-derived butanol mixture under more severe reaction conditions (steam/carbon (S/C)=4, molar ratio), and to develop a new bimetallic system: Co–Ir/ZnO; Figs. 1 and 2 show the catalytic behavior at 600°C of the monometallic (Co/ZnO) and bimetallic (Co–Ir/ZnO) samples. Co/ZnO showed stable catalytic performance over time on stream (90h); concentrations of H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 were approximately 65.5%, 14.2%, 7.4% and 12.6%, respectively, and the raw mixture conversion was approximately 97%. Initially, over Co–Ir/ZnO the raw mixture conversion was 100% but it decreased slightly during the first 40h on stream, and then the raw mixture conversion achieved over Co–Ir/ZnO was similar to that over Co/ZnO (see Fig. 2). However, for the bimetallic catalyst, the H2 concentration in the outlet gas was higher (70% vs. 65.5%) and that of methane was lower (6.1% vs. 12.6%) than that obtained over Co/ZnO. As regards the CO x concentration in the outlet gas, the bimetallic catalyst showed higher CO and lower CO2 concentration than Co/ZnO, this could be related with the different extension of WGSR over the two catalysts. To obtain greater insight into the catalytic role of iridium, a similar catalytic test was carried out over Ir/ZnO (Fig. 3 ). Ir/ZnO showed poorer catalytic behavior than either Co/ZnO or Co–Ir/ZnO (compare results in Figs. 1–3). The initial conversion of the raw mixture over Ir/ZnO was 53%, which, decreased to 39% after 90h on stream; simultaneously, the hydrogen concentration in the outlet gas decreased slightly during the reaction time. Over Ir/ZnO, C2H4 and butanal were obtained as byproducts, in addition to CH4. Co/ZnO, Co–Ir/ZnO and Ir/ZnO were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy after the catalytic reforming of the raw mixture to analyze carbon deposits. The intensity of both the D and G bands followed the order: Ir/ZnO>Co/ZnO>Co–Ir/ZnO. This agrees with the amount of coke deposited during the catalytic test, as determined by TPO experiments: 0.82 mg C g cat - 1 h - 1 , 0.68 mg C g cat - 1 h - 1 and 0.38 mg C g cat - 1 h - 1 for Ir/ZnO, Co/ZnO and Co–Ir/ZnO, respectively. For this determination, the expected O2 consumption in the metal oxidation was subtracted from the total O2 consumed during the TPO experiment. Moreover, the I G/I D ratio, which was 0.78 for Ir/ZnO, 0.73 for Co/ZnO and 0.65 for Co–Ir/ZnO, and the location and shape of the G band, established the following trend for the graphitization of carbon deposits: Ir/ZnO>Co/ZnO>Co–Ir/ZnO. The effect of several noble metals in Co-based catalysts used in vapor-phase reforming processes of ethanol has been associated with the favoring of cobalt reduction promoted by the presence of the noble metal (Brum Pereira et al., 2008, 2010; Profeti et al., 2008). The catalyst showing the best performance in the steam reforming of butanol prepared in this work, Co–Ir/ZnO, achieved complete cobalt reduction at 350°C, this temperature is 100°C lower than that necessary to completely reduce cobalt in Co/ZnO. This fact could be related to the closeness of the contact between Co and Ir, as was recently suggested for Co–Rh catalysts (Brum Pereira et al., 2008; Profeti et al., 2008)."
6,Conclusions,The present study clearly demonstrates that Co–Ir/ZnO catalyst is a good choice of catalyst for hydrogen production from steam reforming of the raw mixture obtained from the fermentation liquid of bioresource-derived butanol. The addition of Ir to Co/ZnO inhibits coke formation and increases H2 concentration while simultaneously decreasing methane concentration in the outlet gas. It opens up a new alternative method for obtaining hydrogen from renewable biomass feedstock.
