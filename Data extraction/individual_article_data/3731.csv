0,Introduction,"The primary energy source for power and transportation is mainly obtained from fossil fuels. Rise in fossil fuel prices, subsidies on non-renewable energy impact the country's economy, which influences energy consumption and directly affects human health and pollution rate [1–3]. Global population growth, industrialization and urbanization have indubitably increased fossil fuel use and atmospheric carbon levels. Global warming and climate change are the results of this process. So concern over environmental factors and human health has created an increasing need for alternative renewable fuel [4,5]. The International Energy Agency report predicts the rise of Asia's energy demand by 76% in 2030 due to overpopulation and technology developments [6]. 80% of biodiesel demand is mainly met by Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Malaysia, Belgium, Spain, and the USA [7]. Biodiesel is produced by a chemical reaction in which vegetable oil or animal fat reacts with alcohol in the presence of a catalyst [8]. The transesterification reaction occurs between the oil and alcohol in addition to a catalyst producing alkyl esters of corresponding oil. The produced esters are known as biodiesel and can be used in existing unmodified diesel engines [9]. Biodiesel is renewable, recyclable, non-toxic, eco-friendly, and engine-friendly; hence it serves as promising biodiesel ensuring sustainable energy in the future [10,11]. Biodiesel emits less engine out emissions than diesel due to its extra 11% O2 content and zero sulfur content [12]. Most physical properties of biodiesel meet the International Standards of ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 [13]. Conventional reactors are costly due to their size and consuming more energy [14]. The major drawbacks of conventional batch-type reactors require excess alcohol (50–300) to move the reaction forward, longer residence time, large size, high energy, and production cost [15]. The problems mentioned above hamper biodiesel's commercialization on an industrial scale [16–18]. Process intensification techniques can overcome the drawbacks of conventional batch-type biodiesel production [19]. In recent years, microreactors have been a promising technique to continuously produce biodiesel with a higher efficiency [20]. It is a miniaturized reactive system with small internal dimensions of 10–1000 μm [21]. Process intensification with intensive reactor technologies has higher mixing and heat transfer rates than conventional batch-type reactors, greatly influencing the reaction rate and reducing residence time [22]. Microreactors can accelerate the reaction rate quicker due to their higher surface area to volume ratio, which shortens the rate of diffusion and improves mass transfer between the oil and methanol [23]. Waste sources from heterogeneous solid catalysts have numerous benefits, including easy separation and purification, yielding high purity glycerol as a byproduct, and catalyst reusability [24,25]. These benefits make heterogeneous catalysts derived from waste an excellent option to lower overall production cost and biodiesel break-even prices. The reactor technological aspects are not the only critical factor for biodiesel synthesis: cost and energy usage are also important considerations. Kapilakarn and Peugtong experimentation in a continuous stir tank with palm oil showed good yield. Two half-sized reactors in series offered biodiesel of 99% purity with less operating cost than a single reactor of the same size. Haas et al. used process modeling software to create a model to calculate the overall cost of a biodiesel production facility. The results revealed that equipment costs accounted for one-third of the overall process cost [26]. Several researchers analyzed the energy consumption of the biodiesel production process in terms of electricity, equipment, human labor, and other factors. They discovered that the production of 1 L of biodiesel from waste cooking oil required 0.013 kWh of power. In biodiesel production, the energy output-input ratio was estimated as 1.49, which means that 1.49 MJ of energy was produced [27]. The complexity and nonlinearity of biodiesel production processes necessitate fast and accurate modeling tools for their design, optimization, monitoring, and control to reduce time consumption and production cost. The data-driven machine learning (ML) algorithms have shown greater predictive capabilities than traditional methods for modeling such highly complex processes. The artificial neural network (ANN) technique is the most extensively used modeling tool in biodiesel research among the current ML techniques. The ANN technique is a computational learning method that mimics the human brain's ability to map input-output links of ill-defined systems through neurological processing [28]. Litinas et al. has designed a novel reactor to improve the mixing rate with a multifunctional process intensifier. The reactor has a center reactive core filled with magnetostrictive cylindrical agents, subjected to external oscillating electromagnetic fields. Under the influence of an oscillating electromagnetic field, magnetostrictive agents were made to vibrate quickly and intensify the mixing of the reagents. It reduced the reaction rate extremely for the two-stage reaction of WCO within 120 s for catalyst consumption of 2.5 wt%, methanol to oil molar ratio of 0.19. It was noted that the process intensifier helped to achieve a higher yield at ambient temperature [29]. Usually, biodiesel production costs are higher than biodiesel due to the high feedstock and processing costs involved, which is a major obstacle against its widespread commercialization. As a result, this review intends to provide an overview and discuss various continuous-flow biodiesel production processes. An analysis was undertaken over SCI/web of science publishing on continuous flow biodiesel production for the last ten years. Based on the analysis, it is inferred that more literature is not available on continuous flow microreactor biodiesel production. Around 30 plus research papers have been published among the 250 papers on continuous flow biodiesel production. Previous research works primarily concentrated on the techniques and conditions used in specific steps of batch biodiesel production. Few studies have been undertaken on biodiesel production using the continuous flow method from the perspective of the entire process, byproduct classifications, and downstream analysis. A detail of significant research works that have been conducted on microreactors for biodiesel production is presented in Table 1 . Furthermore, post-treatment methods needed for better biodiesel quality are also discussed. To facilitate the realization of continuous flow biodiesel production from the lab to the industry, this review, through the comparative study of continuous flow reactors, aims to obtain feasible innovations for potential practical use and improved methods for combined reactors in continuous flow biodiesel production."
1,Continuous flow biodiesel synthesis: state of the art,"Biodiesel is mainly produced by two types of reactors: batch and continuous-flow reactors. Biodiesel produced in batch processes has drawbacks such as the requirement of a high amount of alcohol to move the transesterification reaction forward, separation cost of fatty ester products from the reaction mixture, more water consumption for purification, and high reactor's cost [30]. Continuous biodiesel production using different feedstocks and processing techniques overcame such drawbacks [19]. Continuous flow reactors produce biodiesel of the same quality as batch reactors with low investment and less operating costs. Good mixing of reactants for resistant mass transfer is the primary prerequisite for good biodiesel yield in continuous reactors. Continuous processes are preferred over batch processes as they contribute to consistent product properties and low production costs. The continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) is the most widely used continuous flow reactor where reactants and components are continuously introduced and removed with constant agitation for equivalent chemical composition and temperature [31]. The pictorial representation of CSTR is presented in Fig. 1 . The continuous flow biodiesel synthesis through esterification and transesterification processes with recent techniques was thoroughly studied. The continuous flow transesterification of homogeneous acid and base catalysts was observed to be effectively carried out in ultrasound-assisted, microwave-assisted and, supercritical-assisted. It includes new continuous flow processes such as liquid-liquid film reactors, microchannel reactors, zigzag microchannel reactors, laminar flow reactor separator, slit channel reactors, oscillatory reactor, and centrifugal reactor [31]. Due to the smaller working volume of these reactors, microwave, ultrasonic, and other mechanical energies may be more efficient in supporting the reaction by reducing mass transfer resistance, which is typically a significant issue in batch or CSTR reactors with large working volumes [32]. In comparison, continuous flow transesterification of heterogeneous acid, base, and immobilized enzymes catalyst was observed to be commonly performed in the CSTR, membrane-assisted, packed-bed, fixed-bed, and expended-bed reactors. In which the heterogeneous catalyst was kept inside the reactor and the reactants were continuously sent into the reactor with the help of a pump. Recently developed techniques such as microchannel reactors have improved heat and mass transfer in biodiesel conversion and they are under testing for commercialization for lab or pilot scales."
2,Catalyst,"Catalyst is the most important parameter in the transesterification reaction that reduces the activation energy for the reaction, reduces reaction time, and helps minimize input energy. Biodiesel production can be accomplished without any catalyst, but it would increase residence time and need high heat energy and pressure. In terms of microscale, the catalyst's potential has to be clearly understood for its usage in particular biodiesel production. Catalysts are of homogeneous or heterogeneous categories and are also subdivided into alkali and acidic catalysts. The most commonly used catalyst for transesterification is the homogeneous catalyst due to its cheap cost, shorter reaction time, and greater yield at the optimum operating range. The heterogeneous catalyst has advantages over a homogeneous catalyst such as low cost, low corrosive nature, reusability, and non-soap formation with high free fatty acid (FFA) oils."
3,Homogeneous catalyst,"3.1 Homogeneous catalyst Homogeneous base or acid catalysts are mostly used in the biodiesel industry for transesterification reactions. Homogeneous catalysts are effective and inexpensive but require more alcohol and high energy for the completion of the reaction. The base or acid catalyst selection is merely based on the amount of FFA present in the feedstocks [33]. Afig Mohad investigated a T-junction microchannel reactor for a length of 1 m capillary tube having an inner diameter (ID) = 690 μm and outer diameter (OD) = 1600 μm. The volumetric flow rate of 200 μL/min, methanol to oil molar ratio of 7.6:1, and reaction temperature of 25 °C was maintained throughout the experiments. The study was conducted by varying catalyst concentration, residence time, and the fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) microchannel tube length. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) catalyst ranged from 1 to 5 wt% for the reaction. The maximum biodiesel yield was achieved with refined oil and methanol using 5 wt% of KOH catalyst, the residence time of 40 s, and a temperature of 25 °C. This study concluded that a high KOH catalyst concentration was required to produce the maximum yield at room temperature with a shorter residence time [34]. The summary of homogeneous catalyzed continuous flow biodiesel production is listed in Table 2 . 3.1.1 Base catalyst transesterification mechanism The esters are produced by the reaction of oil or triglycerides and alcohol in a catalyst known as transesterification or alcoholysis. Three sequential and reversible equations describe the overall transesterification reaction, given below in Eqs (1)–(3): triglycerides are converted to diglyceride followed by monoglyceride and glycerol. In addition to these, the glycerides formed are reacted to yield one ester and glycerol in every phase. The reaction rate and speed of the overall process can be improved by adding catalyst [35]. (1) R O O H + T r i g l y c e r i d e ↔ D i g l y c e r i d e + R C O O R 1 (2) R O H + D i g l y c e r i d e ↔ M o n o g l y c e r i d e + R C O O R 2 (3) R O H + M o n o g l y c e r i d e ↔ G l y c e r o l + R C O O R 3 The primary or secondary alcohols with 1–8 carbon atoms are majorly used for transesterification reactions. To tune the transesterification reaction, methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, and heptanol with relative reactivity in the range of 1, 0.81, 0.79, 0.80, and 0.90 were utilized respectively [36]. Methanol is widely used for biodiesel synthesis due to its higher reactivity and low cost as compared to other alcohols [37]. The fundamental disadvantage of employing methanol is that triglycerides are poorly soluble and frequently form biphasic layers, limiting mass and surface transfer. Some studies have employed ether cosolvents such as methyl tertiary-butyl ether or tetrahydrofuran to ameliorate this situation (THF) [38]. On the other hand, base catalysts are often preferred over acidic catalysts due to their increased reactivity and the lower activity circumstances they require, such as lower temperatures [39]. Surplus alcohol is utilized to move the equilibrium towards the product since transesterification is reversible. Although the desired products of transesterification processes are esters, glycerin recovery is equally essential due to its wide applications in everyday items [40]. Water and free fatty acids in the alcohol and triglycerides phase play an important role in soap formation. The reaction of free fatty acid with an alkaline catalyst to form soap and water follows below: (4) Free Fatty Acids + KOH → Soap + Water (5) Free Fatty Acids + KOCH3 → Soap + CH3OH Water present in ester can hydrolyze reverse esterification forming FFA and alcohol reaction follows: (6) Water + Ester ↔ FFA + Alcohol In an irreversible process, the FFA is neutralized by an alkaline catalyst and converted to soap. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) react with the alkoxide catalyst to form soap and dimethyl ether in the following manner: (7) FAME + KOCH3 → Soap + CH3OH When sodium or potassium hydroxides are used as catalysts, methanolate and water are formed, which helps speed up the saponification process. Furthermore, sodium-based catalysts have been observed to provide higher biodiesel yields in a shorter reaction time (typically 30–60 min) as compared to potassium derivatives, which yielded much higher yields in a longer reaction time (120 min) [41]. Rocha et al. investigated the effect of methanol dispersion in oil using a variety of alkaline catalysts (KOCH3, KOH, NaOCH3 and NaOH) in biodiesel synthesis. It was found that the dispersion time of catalyst accounts for 44.6–73.3% of the overall time of biodiesel synthesis. Even though the catalysts reduced the dispersion time, they all raised the methanol-oil interfacial tension. The potassium elements catalyst was more active than their sodium counterparts, resulting in higher biodiesel yields [42]. The base catalyzed transesterification mechanism starts with the catalyst dissociating from alcohol, as shown in Eqs. (8) and (9). The abstraction of methanol protons leads to form an alkoxide or methoxide anions when methanol is used as alcohol. The methanol creates adsorptive sites where methoxide anions formed due to the easy break of O–H bonds in addition to hydrogen cations [43]. The nucleophilic reactions happen due to the methoxide anion, and it reacts with the carbonyl group of triglycerides to form an intermediate alkoxy carbonyl tetrahedral. The intermediate alkoxy carbonyl quickly reacts to form stable FAME and diglyceride anion. The regenerated methoxide cation attacks the diglyceride anions groups, and it generates a new catalyst cycle. Then, monoglycerides and diglycerides are converted into final products, a mixture of alkyl esters and glycerol [44]. (8) Na (or K)OCH3 → Na+ (or K+) + CH3O− (9) Na (or K)OH + CH3OH ↔ Na+ (or K+) + CH3O− + H2O Tapanes et al. investigated the base-catalyzed three-step transesterification reaction process of Jatropha curcas oil and found it valid. The transesterification reaction rate for Jatropha oil with methanol is slightly higher than ethanol since the ethyl group has a strong inductive force. It makes it more difficult to form an ethoxide anion by breaking the ethanol molecule which is more complex than methoxide anion [45]. Guo et al. studied the transesterification mechanism with calcined sodium silicate in the synthesis of soybean oil into biodiesel. Based on their observations, it was found that NaHSiO3 has a higher electron-density difference than in the methanol. Hence, NaHSiO3 has higher O–H polarity than methanol. Similarly, NaHSi2O5 has a longer length O–H bond and higher vibrational stretching frequency than methanol. Also, it was observed that Si–O–H present in calcined sodium carbonate could easily donate a proton [46]. The activity of KOH, KOCH3, NaOH and NaOCH3 in the soybean oil transesterification was studied by Tubino et al. and concluded that for all the temperatures, the potassium catalyst is faster compared to sodium catalyst. The potassium ion pair has a greater dissociation rate than the methanol, so the potassium catalyst has a higher rate. The potassium catalyst has higher catalytic activity due to small electrostatic interactions with methoxide anions than the sodium catalyst. Ion pairs are generated when the cation and transition states come together, resulting in a smaller free energy barrier for the potassium ion pair (compared to the Na homolog) and a faster reaction rate [47]. 3.1.1.1 Base catalyst kinetic mechanism Panić et al. proposed a modified Villermaux–Dushman method to determine the micromixing effect of different mixers [48]. Micromixing efficiency may imply a large interfacial area during two-phase reactions, thus improving the reactor performance for soybean oil ethanolysis. To achieve an equilibrium constant for the overall process, it would be necessary to ignore the formation of side products, resulting in an equilibrium state containing only triglycerides, ethanol, and glycerol. Because many side products were generated in practically all trials, an overall equilibrium could not be constructed. The kinetic modeling findings revealed a shift in the equilibrium state for both sequential steps depending on the type of reactor employed. This should not be regarded as a change in chemistry. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the reactor type significantly impacts mass transfer and micromixing effects because the applied kinetic model does not adequately represent these impacts and rate constants shift [49]. Santana et al. studied reaction kinetics and control of mixing Jatropha curcas and ethanol [50]. In the presence of alcohol (A) and a base catalyst, the reaction rate of triglycerides (TG) can be calculated using the equation below: (10) ( − r T G ) = k 1 C T G ∝ C A β + k 2 C E δ + C G L γ where, k 1 and k 2 are the reaction constants, ( − r TG ) is the triglycerides reaction rate in (mol/(volume time)), C TG , C A , C E and C GL are the molar concentration of triglycerides, alcohol, biodiesel (E) and glycerol (GL), respectively, α, β, δ and γ are the reaction order of triglycerides, alcohol, biodiesel and glycerol, respectively. Eq. (10) is simplified to Eq. (11) by setting the reaction order of (A), (E), and (GL) to zero [45]. (11) ( − r T G ) = k 1 C T G ∝ The conversion of oil was employed to measure the reaction rate within the microchannel. The kinetic model used by Santana et al. does not account for the presence of (monoglyceride and diglyceride) in equilibrium. The moles of triglycerides reacted and produced moles of biodiesel were considered for this kinetic model. Eq. (12) was used to determine the oil conversion: (12) O i l C o n v e r s i o n ( % ) = ( C 0 − C f ) C 0 100 where, C f is the final concentration and C 0 is the initial concentration of Jatropha curcas oil. The average cross-sectional area of the oil inlet was used to calculate the initial concentration. In the output stage, the final concentration was determined. The reaction kinetics was studied with Damköhler numbers using the characteristics time between the process and reaction time. The modeling of biodiesel synthesis via transesterification in chemical reactors has received a lot of attention. However, controlling this process in microreactors is difficult without a good process model. Ajeni et al. proposed a mathematical model to control the reaction and process variables influencing the transesterification reaction in the microreactors. It was found that responses of the proposed model were appropriate and allowed the usage control applications which be more predictive, including Internal Model Control and Model Predictive Control [51]. 3.1.2 Acid catalyst transesterification mechanism The acid-catalyzed transesterification is not as popular as compared to base-catalyzed transesterification due to high methanol consumption and slower reaction rate. Furthermore, an acid catalyzed reaction has lower activity than a base-catalyzed reaction, and the transesterification reaction takes place at a higher process temperature [39]. Solid acid catalysts still need to be used at a greater temperature and pressure to be effective. Furthermore, the technique is impracticable and inefficient due to the significant reaction time [52]. The advantage of adopting an acid catalyzed transesterification, on the other hand, is the tolerance for the presence of large FFAs in the feedstock. Acid catalysts can create biodiesel straight from low-cost lipid feedstock containing more than 6% FFA [53]. Liquid acid catalysts, such as sulphuric acid, are less sensitive to FFA and can conduct both esterification and transesterification at the same time, yielding a large yield of esters. Triglycerides are adsorbed at the catalyst surface in an acid-catalyzed reaction due to protonation in the carbonyl group [54]. The single-site and dual-site mechanisms for acid-catalyzed reactions are based on two assumptions. The absorption and protonation of triglyceride's carbonyl atom with alcohol happen in the Eley-Rideal model or single-site mechanism. In the Langmuir Hinshelwood model or dual-site mechanism, absorption of triglycerides and alcohol occurs at the catalyst surface. The type of carbon in alcohol plays a major role in acid catalyzed processes [55]. Ester's carbonyl group favored carbocation creation through protonation, which in turn creates a tetrahedral intermediate by the alcohol after a nucleophilic attack. This intermediate may remove glycerol from the triglycerides to make a new ester and catalyst regeneration. In the absence of water, acid-catalyzed transesterification should be performed [56]. Despite their lower activity, heterogeneous solid acid catalysts, as opposed to homogeneous acid catalysts, have been used in many industrial processes because they contain a variety of acid sites with variable Brønsted or Lewis acidity strengths. Some advantages of employing solid acid catalysts are as follows: unresponsive to FFA content, in the presence of acid species, simultaneous esterification and transesterification, no need of biodiesel purification stage, easy separation of the catalyst from the reaction products, and reduced corrosion [57]."
4,Heterogeneous catalysts,"3.2 Heterogeneous catalysts Numerous heterogeneous catalysts were investigated for biodiesel production, such as alkaline earth metal oxide, cation exchange resin, and zeolite. The main drawback in a heterogeneous catalyst is the catalyst production cost and its need for special attention in preparation [58,59]. Table 3 summarizes the continuous flow biodiesel production using the heterogenous catalyst. In this respect, discovering a highly effective, low-cost and environmentally sustainable heterogeneous catalyst was a great challenge for researchers. Calcium oxide (CaO) was recognized as a non-corrosive and eco-friendly alkaline catalyst with a high catalytic activity among alkaline metal oxides. Mixed metal oxides, as promising heterogeneous base catalysts, were also included. These catalysts are made up of two or more metals depending on each metal's properties [60]. Sai et al. used calcined eggshells as a heterogeneous catalyst for continuous biodiesel production using rubber seed oil. The raw eggshells were calcined using a muffle furnace at 900 °C. The optimum parameters for conversion were oil to methanol molar ratio 1:9, reaction temperature of 65 °C, the residence time of 4 h, and catalyst concentration of 5 wt% for a yield of 97.84% [30]. Heterogeneous catalysts received much attention due to reusability without loss of operation for several cycles [61]. Because of their low solubility and reusability properties, heterogeneous catalysts have limited environmental impact. However, the catalyst's reusability and usage in subsequent cycles are still in question. The accumulation of organic materials on the catalyst's active site is the primary cause of questionable reusability [54]. The reusable efficiency of the different heterogeneous catalysts is presented in Table 4 . A steady-state packed-bed reactor was used to investigate continuous biodiesel production with soybean oil. For continuous transesterification of soybean oil in a packed-bed reactor, a shell–core Ca(C3H7O3)2/CaCO3 solid-base catalyst with a mechanically powerful core of CaCO3 was prepared. A maximum yield of 95% fatty acid methyl ester (FAME, i.e. biodiesel) was obtained for a reaction temperature of 60 °C, alcohol–oil molar ratio of 30:1, and retention time of 168 min. The catalyst's reusability was tested for up to 5 cycles, and there was no noticeable decrease in catalyst activity. Due to the deactivation of Ca(C3H7O3)2 and hydrolysis of FAME, water in the oil significantly reduced FAME yield [62]. 3.2.1 The effect of heterogeneous catalyst synthesis method on biodiesel yield The heterogeneous catalyst synthesis method may affect the quality and quantity of biodiesel produced via transesterification reaction. The catalyst's stability, structure, crystallinity, and distribution of the active sites may vary based on the catalyst synthesis method used. Hydrothermal techniques, solid-state, impregnation, co-precipitation, ultrasonic-assisted and microwave-assisted synthesis are some catalyst preparation methods. Teo et al. used the hydrothermal method to synthesis irregular round-shaped heterogeneous calcium methoxide catalyst particles, which was more cost-effective. Furthermore, as compared to alternative catalyst synthesis methods, hydrothermal is an environmentally favorable process. For biodiesel production from Jatropha curcas oil, the catalysts performed better. The catalyst has negligible catalytic activity loss, making it reusable and easy to separate from the final product [63]. Hoor and Anbia used a co-precipitation approach with Zn salt impregnation to make a magnesium-aluminum layered double hydroxide for WCO biodiesel production. Zn impregnation of Mg/Al LDH resulted in a 78.5% yield, compared to 57.3% for co-precipitated ZnMgAl. Both co-precipitation and impregnation methods were utilized to synthesis the catalyst. It was observed that the catalyst's layered and nanoparticle structures improved the transesterification reaction., The layered platelet structure of the ZnMgAl sites was accessible to propagate the reaction when only co-precipitation was used. Compared to co-precipitation, the co-precipitation-impregnation technique yielded a more stable catalyst [64]. Aderibigbe et al. reported that the preparation of heterogeneous catalysts and support material used in synthesizing catalysts impacts the ester yield and properties. The biodiesel yield of MgO supported was higher than ZnO, and green synthesized catalyst has more advantage than wet impregnation synthesized counterparts [65]. 3.2.2 Heterogeneous catalyst reaction mechanism Conjugated oxygen anions on the surface of alkaline-earth metal oxide catalysts govern their basic catalytic characteristic, increasing the biodiesel yield. According to Kouzu et al., the metal oxide catalysts' BET surface area of SrO was 2 m2g-1, CaO was 13 m2g-1 and MgO 200 m2g-1. As a result, the catalytic performance of alkaline-earth metal oxides is determined by the base characteristics emerging from the oxygen anions of active sites. The electron density of the metal cation would be greater towards the conjugated metal cation due to its higher electronegativity, forming the oxygen anion base properties to degrade [66]. Fraile et al. did more research on the MgO–Al2O3 catalyst in the sunflower oil transesterification with methanol. It was determined that residual alkaline ions are the primary source for catalytic activity and strong basicity, which relies on the reaction mechanism [67]. Shahabaldin et al. experimented with the esterification of wild mustard oil using a heterogenous LaTiO3 catalyst. Initially, mustard oil triglycerides were adsorbed on the nano-catalyst surface of La3+ and Ti3+ Lewis acid sites, whereas the catalyst surface of the O2− regions absorbed the methanol molecules. Following that, the CH3O anion group intermolecularly attacked the C꞊O triglyceride group, forming a tetrahedral intermediate. The tetrahedral intermediate then reorganized, yielding diglyceride ions and FAME. Finally, the diglyceride ions reacted with the protonated catalyst to produce the same catalyst and diglyceride as before. This chemical cycle repeats twice more to produce the final fatty acid methyl ester and glycerol [68]."
5,Continuous flow biodiesel synthesis techniques,
6,Oscillatory flow reactor,"4.1 Oscillatory flow reactor Oscillatory flow reactor (OFR) is a type of continuous flow tubular reactor where the piston drive creates oscillatory flow when the orifice plate baffles are spaced equally [69]. The oscillatory motion is created during the introduction of bulk fluid into the reactor. This improves radial mixing and heat and mass transfer despite maintaining the plug flow [70]. Due to the reactor's oscillatory mixing conditions, it consumes a longer residence time and is independent of the Reynolds number of bulk fluids flowing through it. Thus OFR can be designed with a shorter length to diameter ratio to ensure economic biodiesel production with low initial and pumping cost and is easy to control due to its smaller footprint [71]. A synthesized glucose acid catalyst is used to produce eco-friendly biodiesel under atmospheric conditions in the continuous oscillatory flow reactor. The fabricated oscillatory flow reactor of 1.1 m height and internal diameter of 0.0635 m was used to conduct the reaction. The reactor was linked to the feedstock tank and other processing units. The reactor had an internal volume of 0.0035 m3 and was composed of two vertically placed jacket tubes comprising a set of orifices. When fluid oscillation started, the piston's motion was superimposed, causing vigorous eddy mixing at the edge of the baffles when the positioned baffles came into n contact along the length of the tube. The palm fatty acid distillate was converted to biodiesel under optimum conditions. FAME yield was 94.21% for optimum process conditions: residence time of 50 min, reaction temperature of 60 °C, alcohol to molar ratio of 9:1, the oscillation frequency of 6 Hz, and a catalyst concentration of 2.5 wt%. This revealed the effectiveness of the OFR technology was dependent on mean residence time distribution, heat and mass transfer. The OFR reactor proved to be an efficient technology for heterogeneous acid catalysts because of the tubes' equally spaced orifice plate baffles [72]. Zheng et al. performed biodiesel synthesis with refined vegetable oil and alkali catalyst in a stirred tank reactor and OFR for the analysis of the reactor performance and oil conversion. The OFR was made of 8 mesh tubes each of 730 cm e length for a total volume of 103 mL. Transesterification was undertaken with a catalyst concentration of 1 wt%, a temperature of 60 °C and a flow rate of 126 mL/h. The results showed that the yield of biodiesel in the stirred tank reactor and OFR was similar. Distinct baffle configurations also showed good multiphase contact and high mass transfer rates, allowing for diverse applications [73]. Harvey et al. conducted experiments on an OFR reactor consisting of two vertical tubes with a diameter of 25 mm and volume of 1.56 dm3. The reaction was conducted with a methanol to oil molar ratio of 1.5:1, reaction temperature of 20–70 °C, NaOH/methanol ratio of 1:25, and residence time of 10–30 min. It was found that biodiesel yield was >95% for the reaction temperature of 50 °C and residence time of 30 min. The yield increased with an increase in the reaction time [31]. Phan et al. conducted continuous transesterification of rapeseed oil with base catalyst (KOH) and methanol in the mesoscale oscillatory baffled reactors. The experiment was conducted under the following conditions: temperature of 50 °C, methanol to molar ratio of 1:5, 1% w/w catalyst of oil for a 2 mL/min flow rate. In a non-oscillatory steady state, the flow occurred in a laminar flow regime. The glycerol accumulation on the central disc baffles and helical wound wires was initially noticed due to improper mixing. To overcome this problem, reactors were designed with sharp edges and helical baffles to boost mass transfer between two liquid phase interactions. This resulted in faster mixing at low flow rates and low oscillatory Reynolds numbers. Methyl esters yield increased as a result of the design [71,74]. The major disadvantages of the oscillatory flow reactors are that they do not have an integrated separation unit for the final products."
7,Microchannel reactor,"4.2 Microchannel reactor Micro-reactor technology is an advancement in biodiesel production for high efficiency in the continuous production of biodiesel compared to conventional reactors. Micro-reactors are designed to process transesterification in a short time and are of different types of structures and shapes based on necessity. The pictorial representation of the microchannel reactor is illustrated in Fig. 2 [75]. They are designed to ensure proper mixing of the oil and alcohol to make the reaction occur appropriately. In micro-reactors, the biodiesel production rate was higher because of their high chemical reaction rate and reduction in reaction time [76]. Semi-industrial pilot-scale microreactors were studied to transesterification of waste cooking oil and methanol with potassium hydroxide as the catalyst. The microreactor system consisted of 50 microtubes over a length of 530 cm with an internal diameter of 0.8 mm for continuous production of biodiesel with a volume of 200 mL. The microtubes were supplied with heat energy using an insulated cylindrical water bath of diameter 12.5 cm and length 500 cm. With the following optimum conditions: reaction temperature of 62.4 °C, catalyst amount of 1.16 wt%, oil to methanol molar ratio of 1:9.4, and residence time of 120 s maximum biodiesel yield of 98.26%.was shown. This study showed that the microreactor had advantages over batch reactors in residence time and purity of biodiesel, making it superior for biodiesel synthesis [77]. Micro-channel reactors were used for the transesterification of sunflower oil by Bhoi et al., where methanol was used with catalyst potassium hydroxide (KOH) for the reaction. Based on the fluid combinations, three different types of micro-reactors were used for testing. Primarily T-type for entrances, followed by a cross-type junction for the 3 entrances, and finally, a split and recombination flow pattern was used. Of the three configurations, cross-type junction had a higher conversion rate (>90%) than others. All configurations had a minimum residence time of 1–2 min. The conversion rate was not altered by temperature. The conversion rate was not orderly when the flow rate was raised, and it hence did not correlate with the conversion of oil [78]. Zig-zag micro-channels were investigated by Wen et al. for biodiesel production improvisation. The reacting conditions were methanol to oil in the molar ratio of 9:1, temperature of 56 °C and potassium hydroxide catalyst amount of 1.2 wt%. The reactor had 99.5% methyl ester yield with a residence time of 28 s, which was comparatively higher than that of conventional reactors. The zig-zag micro-channel reactor had high reaction efficiency by having a passive mixing micro-scale, which intensified the overall volumetric mass transfer. The distribution of lesser channel size with a hydraulic diameter of 240 μm along with a higher number of turns (350/1.07 μm) in the experiments resulted in the formation of smaller droplets. The formation of smaller droplets improved the efficiency of biodiesel synthesis [79]. The packed micro-channel reactor is a micro-reactor technology in continuous biodiesel synthesis. Nut Chueluecha et al. experimented on a packed bed micro-channel reactor. The micro-reactor technology had the following reacting conditions in the system: temperature of 65 °C, the residence time of 485 s, and oil to methanol ratio of 1:24. Based on the European standards and ASTM norms, high-quality biodiesel was synthesized shorter than in a conventional reactor. The catalyst was pretreated with methanol for improved results. The pretreated calcium oxide (CaO) catalyst had greater chemical reactions during transesterification than without CaO catalyst. The stability of the catalyst in the reactions was excellent. The reactor thus showed superior results for the following design and reaction conditions [80]. Guan et al. investigated the continuous production of biodiesel with microtubular reactors for the transesterification of sunflower oil and methanol with potassium hydroxide using T-shaped micromixer for better mixing. The microreactor with 0.8 mm internal diameter and a length of 300 mm produced 99% biodiesel conversion for the following conditions: residence time of 100 s, oil to methanol molar ratio of 1:23.9, KOH catalyst of 4.5 wt% with a flow rate of 8.2 cm3/h at 60 °C. The reaction rate was mainly influenced by temperature and molar ratio which had positive influences on their increment [81]. Biodiesel production using circular tubes of 1.5 mm internal diameter made up of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) was used for transesterification of canola oil and methanol with sodium hydroxide catalyst by Jachuck et al. A maximum yield of 98% was obtained for oil to methanol molar ratio of 1:6, residence time of 180 s and reaction temperature of 60 °C. Low catalyst concentration had a positive influence on the temperature of the oil conversion. Similarly, catalyst concentration increment had good results in canola oil transesterification. But this was limited to 0.75% concentration of the catalyst. Microchannel geometry also helped separate glycerol from the biodiesel in a continuous manner [18]. Capillary microreactors were used to produce biodiesel continuously by Juan et al. High methyl ester yield was obtained in the microchannel reactor which was comparably greater than in the batch reactors. The residence time in the microreactor was less compared to the batch reactor under the same operating conditions. Controlling the residence time of biodiesel production was done to avert the saponification process of biodiesel along with the catalyst KOH. Catalyst concentration influenced the ester yield, an increase in KOH increased ester production but a high concentration of KOH led to a decrease in methyl ester. The capillary micrometer specification influenced biodiesel synthesis; the inner diameter of the reactor influenced the yield. The channel size of the capillary micrometer was reduced, which had a larger specific surface and intensified mass transfer ensuring thigh methyl ester yield [82]."
8,Micro coil reactor,"4.3 Micro coil reactor Table 5 summarizes the different microreactors with micromixers and their configuration used to produce biodiesel. Mohadesi et al. studied biodiesel synthesis in a stainless steel microreactor of 1 cm3 volume and an internal diameter of 0.8 mm. Waste cooking oil and methanol with cow bones derived catalyst were pumped with a peristaltic pump into the reactor. Cow bones were selected as the catalyst because of their high CaO content. In comparison with homogeneous reactions, heterogeneous reactions have a slower rate of biodiesel production. Therefore, it reduced the residence time of the microreactor by half up to 1 min. A 99% biodiesel was obtained under optimized conditions, including an oil to methanol volume ratio of 2.25 v/v, catalyst concentration of 8.5 wt%, and residence time of 60 s at 63.1 °C [83]. The schematic representation of the micro-coil reactor is shown in Fig. 3 . The experimental results of the biodiesel produced with batch reactor and tubular microreactor were investigated. Transesterification of sunflower oil with sodium methoxide catalyst was undertaken with ethanol to oil molar ratio of 6:1 and catalyst concentration of 0.7 wt%. The results showed that 99% of conversion occurred at a shorter residence time of 4 min, which was 15 times less than the batch reactor. Flow patterns showed that the impact of slug flow increased with mass transfer due to the internal movement in the slugs [84]."
9,Laminar-flow reactor and separator,"4.4 Laminar-flow reactor and separator The reactants flow through tangled paths in the mixing chamber before entering the main reaction vessel in a laminar flow reactor-separator, which has a small chamber that serves as a static mixing unit and is surrounded by a large reaction vessel. Because of the significant increase in column diameter, bulk velocity decreased in the axial direction as the emulsified reactants entered the main reaction chamber. When the reactor operated at laminar flow, glycerol settled down whenever there was a lower upward flow velocity than the settling velocity of glycerol [85]. Unker et al. conducted a transesterification reaction using waste canola oil as feedstock and methanol with KOH catalyst using the laminar flow reactor-separator. The diagrammatic experimental setup of the laminar-flow reactor and separator is shown in Fig. 4 . A maximum yield of 99% with high purity glycerol was achieved under operating conditions of 1.3 wt% catalyst concentration, methanol to oil molar ratio of 6:1 and a reactant flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. The reactor's design helped to settle the glycerol droplets at the bottom since the reacting flow traveled upward [86,87]."
10,Centrifugal contactor separator,"4.5 Centrifugal contactor separator Continuous centrifugal contactor separator (CCCS) primarily has a static reactor block where a hollow rotating centrifuge is present through which the reactants are made to flow into the annular zone of the component. The mixing of immiscible liquids occurs between the rotating centrifuge and the static component [88,89]. After mixing the reactants, the mixture is shifted to a hollow centrifuge and h 900 g of centrifugal force is applied to separate the products. The annular zone was continued up to 45 mL with a weir size of 0.875 inches. The reactant mixture oil and catalyst with ethanol were preheated to 60 °C. Feeding was done with a rotor and oil pump. Ethanol with sodium ethoxide was fed at a 4.4–40.5 mL/min flow rate using the rotor and pump. The temperature of 60 °C, an oil feed rate of 28 mL/min, and 1 wt% of sodium ethoxide at 2100 rpm produced maximum biodiesel of 98%at a volumetric rate of 112 kg/m3/min (liquid). The CCCS system type CINC V02 is shown in Fig. 5 . It was used to examine reaction variables that affected biodiesel yields such as molar ratio of alcohol, catalyst concentration temperature, and rotational speed. Since the CCCS reactor is easily portable, strong, and reliable in operation, local communities can utilize it to change waste cooking oils into potential biodiesel [90]. The reactor consists of three sections: the CCCS to execute sunflower oil and methanol transesterification reaction, a liquid-liquid separator for washing crude FAME, and an air drying unit for FAME. A maximum yield of 98% was obtained by operating the CCCS unit for 4 h continuously with a methanol flow rate of 10 mL/min, oil flow rate of 32 mL/min, catalyst loading of 1.2% w/w, reaction temperature of 60 °C, and rotational speed of 35 Hz. The biodiesel washing unit was supplied with water (presence of 1% w/w acetic acid) at a flow rate of 10 mL/min at 20 °C and air at a flow rate of 12 mL/min [91]."
11,Slit channel reactor,"4.6 Slit channel reactor A slit channel reactor can be used for transesterification reaction in a reduced area that is only a few degrees greater than that of the microchannel setup. The slit channel reactor can be manufactured easily at a low cost [92]. Kalu et al. developed a slit channel reactor (Fig. 6 ) for biodiesel synthesis from soyabean oil and methanol with sodium hydroxide as catalyst. The reaction started with methanol to oil molar ratio of 6:1, temperature of 55–65 °C, and 0.0263 g NaOH/mL of methanol. Biodiesel yield increased with an increase in channel depth (1 mm) for a residence time of 2 min because of efficient mixing. It was seen that less residence time was required by the shallow slit channels for transesterification in addition to providing improved performance compared to batch reactors for homogenous catalysts [93]."
12,Reactive distillation,"4.7 Reactive distillation Reactive distillation (RD) is a typical biodiesel synthesis unit with a combination of two systems; after transesterification, the products are collected and sent to the methanol recovery unit [94]. The reaction distillation column consists of a basic reactive zone followed by rectifying and stripping separation sections, which may get extended based on the reaction mixture's separation character [95]. The volatility of water and methanol is higher than ester and acid and can be easily separated without any rectifying zone at the top of the RD column. The reactive zone does the process by covering the whole column and hence no stripping zone is required [96]. Boon-anuwat et al. simulated the soyabean oil methanolysis process using Aspenplus software to calculate the four different continuous processes which use homogeneous base catalyst and heterogeneous acid catalyst in a conventional reactor and RD which was designed and simulated. For continuous biodiesel reaction in RD using magnesium methoxide (heterogeneous) catalyst, the following optimal conditions were found: number of reactive stages, 6; reboiler heat duty, 70 kW; reflux ratio, 0.1; ratio of methanol to oil, 4:1. Under these optimum conditions, the yield of the biodiesel was 97.5% with high purity glycerol of 98% as a byproduct and energy required was 153 kWh ton−1. The experiment found out that RD was beneficial than a conventional reactor while using homogenous (sodium methoxide) and heterogeneous (magnesium methoxide) catalysts for the continuous process of transesterification and separation. In addition, it showed that the heterogeneous (magnesium methoxide) catalyst had more important advantages over the homogeneous catalyst such as needing fewer unit operations, lower energy consumption, and zero necessity for neutralization, waste disposal or processing of salt waste [97]. Pradana et al. studied the reaction of palm oil with a heterogeneous catalytic (K/AC) reactive distillation column. The study found that RD increased FAME yield, reduced catalyst usage, and avoided azeotrope mixture. The highest methyl ester yield of 82.69% was attained for the RD reactor with a temperature of 60 °C and methanol to oil molar ratio of 6:1 [98]. The main disadvantage of the reactive distillation column is that it requires expensive packaging or catalyst where a high reaction temperature is required for a high reaction rate. It also has a possibility of high-pressure drop due to the complex design of the reactor."
13,Continuous flow ultrasonic reactor,"4.8 Continuous flow ultrasonic reactor Based on frequency, it is possible to classify ultrasound into two simple ranks; low frequency (LFU, 20–100 kHz) and high-frequency ultrasound (HFU, 2–10 MHz) [99]. Ultrasound irradiation causes bubble formation, growth, and implosive collapse in liquids, leading to continuous compression and expansion pressure on the liquid and local heating [100]. Veljkovic et al. used ultrasound to catalyze the transesterification process of edible vegetable and non-edible oil or animal fats with acyl acceptors (mostly alcohols, i.e., methanol and ethanol) using heterogeneous and homogeneous acid and base catalysts or biocatalysts [101]. In the reaction system, ultrasound was believed to cause the development of a fine emulsion between immiscible fluids such as triglycerides and alcohol [102]. The surface area available for the reaction between the oil and alcohol phases was greatly increased, thereby speeding up the reaction during the formation of emulsified solution [103]. Ultrasound-generated cavitation provides energy for mechanical mixing energy and the initiation of the transesterification reaction. Further ultrasonic cavitation also increased the transesterification rate by raising the interfacial surface temperature between the immiscible phases [104]. Trinh and Yusup experimented on both batch and continuous reactors where the continuous reactor showed greater results than conventional techniques. The experimental results showed that esterification and transesterification on ultrasonicator (35 kHz) using nonedible rubber seed oil consumed 0.07 and 0.04 kJ/mL energy respectively. The optimum conditions for the continuous esterification process were residence time 3.5 min, oil to methanol ratio 1:23, and reaction temperature 50 °C, with FFA conversion of 95.95%. Similarly, a FAME yield of 89.23% was obtained with optimum conditions of the residence time of 2.3 min and oil to methanol ratio of 1:9.8 at 45 °C. Comparing the energy consumption of the continuous ultrasonicator with a batch reactor was found to be 19 times lesser than the batch system. Maintaining a low temperature for the sonicator to ensure a safe reaction [105]."
14,Continuous flow microwave reactor,"4.9 Continuous flow microwave reactor A microwave (MW) reactor uses microwave irradiation to deliver energy directly to the reactants, thereby accelerating the chemical reaction rate [106]. It helps to achieve conversions in less time compared to conventional heating in similar reactors [107]. MW reactors have been used for biodiesel synthesis in recent years. With polar and ionic elements in the mixture of vegetable oil, alcohol, and methanol, microwave irradiation plays an active role in rapidly and efficiently heating reactants to the required temperature [108]. Microwave-assisted transesterification is inadequate and often ineffective in terms of capacity when dealing with large amounts of reactants in a batch reactor. The short penetration depth of a few centimeters by MW radiation into the absorption materials is the most important drawback of this technology, which is based on their dielectric properties [109]. The density of microwave power within a large batch reactor with more than 1 L working volume is much lower than on the surface. Thus, by convection alone and not by microwave dielectric heating, are materials in the middle of the reaction vessel heated. As a result, when the volume of the reactant increases, the amount of energy required to heat also increases, thereby necessitating greater radiation power. Large working volumes are commonly used in batch reactors. The microwave intensity to be used increases with an increase in the reactor operating volume, which increases energy requirements. This necessitates sophisticated reactor construction for microwave irradiation protection. These issues can be solved by using a continuous flow microwave reactor, where the reactant mixture flows through the microwave at an appropriate flow rate, preventing penetration depth issues [110,111]. As stated by Choedkiatsakul et al., the continuous flow microwave reactor was also explored for biodiesel development. The commercially available microwave system will help streamline the setup and the configuration of the reactor. However, the size of these devices also limits the production of biodiesel that must be carried out on a laboratory scale. To effectively transfer electricity, the use of thin coiled tubing in the microwave system is advantageous. Since a continuous microwave device does not have a mechanical stirrer, homogeneous heating can only be performed through complete microwave penetration into the reactants. The microwave device can achieve a 99.4% biodiesel yield in 105 s residence time [112]."
15,Packed bed microreactor,"4.10 Packed bed microreactor The most commonly used reactor is the packed bed reactor to produce biodiesel from various feedstocks [113]. Feng et al. designed and developed a packed bed reactor for continuous esterification of acidified oil using NKC-9 resin (Fig. 7 ). A maximum free fatty acid conversion efficiency of 98% was obtained with a 0.62 mL/min feed flow rate at 65 °C [114]. Packed bed reactors use a heterogeneous catalyst such as potassium supported pumitic-structured catalytic material, anion exchange resin, Ca(C3H7O3)2/CaO, enamel Venus shell-derived catalyst, C3H7O3/CaCO3, and lipase–Fe3O4 nanoparticle biocomposite catalyst as packed materials for the bed [115]. A packed bed reactor mainly consists of a stainless steel or cylindrical glass chamber packed with pellets or catalysts through which the liquid flows over the catalyst. The liquid reacts with the catalyst over its length and alters the chemical composition of the compound during the flow. While designing a packed bed reactor, the most important things to be considered are heat and mass transfer and the chemical reactions over the bed. It is necessary to study and optimize heat transfer across the packed bed to lower the running cost of the equipment. During modeling of the reactor, the catalyst is modeled as a porous structure that acts as a transport medium of different magnitudes for particles and leads to the challenging task of mass and energy transport analysis [116,117]. In a packed bed reactor, the pressure drop is a major challenge. Usage of the catalyst with a larger particle size can reduce pressure drop and lead to slower intraparticle diffusion, which will slow down the reaction rate. The main advantages of a packed bed reactor are easy operation, flexibility and a higher amount of catalyst usage [118]. Rojas et al. synthesized biodiesel using calcium methoxide catalyst and palm oil in the fixed bed reactor. The ester yield was found to be below 70% with 25 g CaO catalyst having a particle size of 0.6–1.18 mm in the packed bed. The optimum conditions of the reactor were found to be 60 °C reaction temperature, 0.5 mL/min feed flow rate and 6.9:1 methanol to oil molar ratio [119]. Bakkiyaraj et al. stated that lipase-catalyzed transesterification was energy and cost-saving process. Using the central composite design, feed flow rate and bed height were optimized for a higher yield of biodiesel. Optimum feed flow rate and a bed height of 1.36 L/h, 3.26 cm, and 1.3 L/h, 3.26 cm ensured a yield of 81% and 83% for the Karanja and Jatropha oils respectively [120]. The disadvantages of the packed bed reactor are low reaction rate in relation to catalyst mass, adequate mass transfer of all reacting compounds to the catalyst surface, and demand for the removal of heat produced during the reaction. The desire to maximize catalyst potential for high liquid flow rates is not cost-effective when there is a low flow rate of liquid and bad contact efficiencies. Continuous reactors have various advantages in biodiesel yield. Among continuous reactors, microreactors are more efficient due to their high surface volume ratios and greater mass and heat transfer rates. The microreactors mixing unit plays a significant role in the yield and creates an impact on parameters affecting biodiesel yield. Hence a microreactor has great potential for the industrial production of biodiesel."
16,Factors affecting the liquid-liquid two phase flow pattern,
17,Reaction temperature,"5.1 Reaction temperature Capillary microreactors are less influenced by reaction temperature and have less effect over the yield of FAME compared with parameters like concentration of KOH, methanol to oil molar ratio, residence time, and reaction temperature [82,121]. FAME yield increased from 96 to >99% when the temperature was raised from 30 to 60 °C, whereas an increase in temperature from 60 to 70 °C decreased the yield [122]. The flow pattern changed from slug to bubble flow when the temperature was raised above the methanol's boiling point, thus reducing biodiesel yield. In the presence of an alkaline catalyst, the process of saponification of glycerides increased [123]. Guan et al., experimental results showed that the conversion rate of oil increased in a stainless-steel microtube reactor with an inner diameter of 0.8 mm when reaction temperature rose to 60 °C in a methanol and sunflower oil transesterification process [124,125]. FAME yield increased in a designed microstructure reactor when reaction temperature rose from 60 to 70 °C for cottonseed oil and methanol transesterification. It was observed that 91% FAME yield was obtained with the use of CH3NaO catalyst and when the reaction was at room temperature, it required a longer residence time [126,127]."
18,Inlet mixer type,"5.2 Inlet mixer type Microfluidic devices are used for the agitation process in microchannel reactors. Major chemical reactions happening in the microreactors involve the mixing of two or more fluids. The use of micromixers enhances their mixing efficiency [50]. Micromixers are of two types, static or active with different geometries. Active mixing devices use external sources such as electric or magnetic excitation, whereas static mixers use the difference of pressure for mixing. Both mixers have different mixing principles with a variety of operational capacities and speeds [128]. Microreactors improve the yield which depends on the residence time and increment in operating conditions. Micromixers are used to improve the reactants' chemical interaction and reduce the reaction's residence time [129]. The major challenges in microreactors are mixing two liquids of different polarities such as oil and methanol. The problem can be rectified by using micromixers. The most widely used micromixers for mixing oil and alcohol are the J-type and T-type mixers. The distinction between J-type and T-type mixers is that the impact angles of oil and methanol are 180° and 90° respectively. The T-type mixers produce tiny droplets of oil and methanol due to high pressure. On the contrary, J-type mixers produce large diameter droplets due to low pressure. Earlier studies showed that the performance of T-type mixers was excellent compared to J-type mixers [130]. However, co-axial mixers were not often used for oil and methanol mixing. In co-axial mixers, the impact angle at 0° created a circular motion of oil and methanol inside the microchannel, resulting in excellent mixing. Higher biodiesel yields were achieved with increased methanol molar ratio and temperature in a microreactor with T mixer assisted biodiesel production. Besides, a quasi-homogeneous behavior of oil and methanol mixture was observed at the inlet of the microreactor due to the strong accumulation of droplets at the microreactor's outlet [81]. Identical studies were done with T-type mixers of three types of inner diameters (ID) such as 1.27, 2.286, and 0.33 mm. The results showed that the biodiesel yield was highly reliable with the mass transfer rate and persuaded by the inner diameter of the micromixer [131]. Mixing efficiency was investigated using three distinct micromixers with cosolvent (hexane) and three different meeting angles such as 45°, 90°, and 135°. Maximum biodiesel yield was achieved at 45° compared to the other angles of 135° and 90°. This was due to the non-polarity of hexane which caused homogeneity between oil and alcohol [132]. Kaewchada et al. investigated biodiesel production in a microtube reactor using a T/J mixer. A higher flow rate increased the biodiesel yield in the microreactor with a T mixer. Also, the T-type had better mixing than the J-type mixer due to pressure at the impact of the two streams, resulting in a reduction in the size of the droplets [130]. Guan et al. performed transesterification with a 1 mm ID microtube supplied with a conventional mixer type of T and split and recombined micromixer. T type mixer improved methyl ester conversion compared to the split and recombined micromixer because of its larger surface area, making the methanol flow uniform [81]. Sun et al. compared the performance of four different micromixers: T-type, J-type, rectangle, and slit interdigital. Biodiesel yield obtained with the rectangle and slit interdigital micromixers was twice the volume of the T-type and J-type mixers. The yields increased with an increasing flow rate due to a better mass transfer between oil and methanol. These mixers improved the mixing rate and reduced the gel formation inside the microreactor. Besides, the rectangular interdigital mixer revealed better performance than the slit mixer [132]. Besides, the effects of T-type, cross-type and double T-type micromixers were compared and described. In the T type, alcohol and the mixing oil flowed internally through the two inlets, whereas the oil flowed through the center inlet at the cross-mixer. In the double T-type micromixer, the oil flowed through the inside of the first two inputs while alcohol flowed internally through the other two inputs. Among the above said three mixers, cross mixers showed a better mixing and higher biodiesel yield [133]. Also, microreactors with zig-zag micromixers were used to produce biodiesel in the presence of an alkaline catalyst. Oil pumped into this mixer met methanol at a rectangular point that functioned as multiple laminates. The performance of microchannels improved by continuous mixing in these mixers compared to single mixers. Process performance can be enhanced by the addition of several parallel pairs of mixing conditions and reaction sheets. Error inflow distribution can be eased by dividing the flow in the mixing systems. In a zig-zag microchannel, the reactor significantly dropped incorrect flow distribution as a result of improved mixing speed in zig-zag channels and fine results of transesterification reaction performance [50]. It can be concluded that T-type mixers showed better mixing and higher biodiesel yield compared to other mixers. Quantitative analysis of a T-junction microchannel reactor showed the oil conversion rate was greater for a high molar ratio and reduced when the molar ratio was reduced. The change in molar ratio changed the hydrodynamic characteristics with respect to the interfacial area (surface to volume) and the number of slugs. At room temperature, the usage of a simple play and plug microchannel reactor had the highest conversion rate of 98% for a shorter residence time of 80 s [34]."
19,Alcohol to oil molar ratio,"5.3 Alcohol to oil molar ratio The alcohol mainly influences methyl ester yield to triglyceride molar ratio. An excess amount of alcohol was used to have a forward reaction to a higher reaction equilibrium for methyl ester production [134]. Usually, the amount of alcohol required for the quantity of oil was calculated empirically and it was established that the usage of more alcohol made glycerol removal tedious [135]. Studies made for the molar ratio of methanol to oil showed a range from 6 to 48 for biodiesel production. The highest conversion rate of biodiesel was observed in the reactants molar ratio of 1:12 for oil to methanol compared with the lowest conversion rate of 6: 1 for methanol to oil molar ratio. Production of biodiesel decreased when the molar ratio for methanol to oil increased above 12:1 due to a reversible transesterification reaction. Yuan et al. undertook a transesterification process using waste-pre-treated oil and observed the maximum conversion rate for methanol to oil molar ratio as 6.5:1 [136]. Leug and Guo made an earlier report, resulting in the maximum conversion rate for 7:1 methanol to oil molar ratio [137]. The molar ratio of 6:1 for alcohol to triglyceride was the most accepted because of the maximum methyl ester conversion [138]."
20,Effect of microchannel configuration,"5.4 Effect of microchannel configuration 5.4.1 Effect of channel size Microchannel size impacted methyl ester yield in the microreactor due to the distinct mass transfer rate between alcohol and oil phases in various microchannels [139]. Kalu et al. used the slit channel reactor for biodiesel synthesis in which the effect of channel depth was studied. It was observed that a decrement in channel depth from 10, 5, and 2 to 1 mm impacted the conversion rate of soyabean oil. On increasing channel depth, channels tended to be a batch system and became less efficient than shallow channels [140]. Wen et al. studied the effect of microchannel size and ester yield using zig-zag microchannels for transesterification of soyabean oil with varying diameters ranging from 240 to 900 mm. It was noticed that the lower channel diameter provided the highest biodiesel yield [141]. Guan et al. experimented on sunflower oil conversion with a decrease in the microchannel diameter from 1 to 0.8, 0.6 and 0.4 mm and found a linear increment in the yield [81,142]. Similarly, in the capillary microreactor, a channel with an internal diameter of 0.53 mm and residence time of 8.2 min yielded 96.7%, whereas using a capillary of diameter 0.25 mm and residence time of 6 min showed a yield of 98.8% [82]. 5.4.2 Effect of mixture type When a reaction occurs between two immiscible liquids, the mixing mechanism becomes the major influencing parameter. The yield of biodiesel is majorly affected by the structure of the mixer applied to improve the mixing of the alcohol and oil phases. The microreactor system usually has a combined mixer to create dispersion, ongoing with the reaction channel. Sun et al. used four different micromixers: T-mixer, J-mixer, rectangular interdigital micromixer (RIMM), and a slit interdigital micromixer (SIMM-V2) with stainless steel capillary tubes having an internal diameter of 0.6 mm to study the effect of mixer type on biodiesel yield. Micromixers T and J had similar yields, while the yield of RIMM and SIMM-V2 was twice that of T and J mixers. Yields of SIMM –V2 and RIMM were higher due to their mixing intensification and smaller mixer dimensions [133]. Bhoi et al. used three different mixers: T-type, cross-type, and split and recombination for methanolysis of sunflower oil. The cross-type mixer was more efficient than the T and split and recombine type micromixers [78]. Shaaban et al. used three different types of mixers T1, T2, and T3 with varied internal diameters and geometry for the yield of methyl ester under the same residence time, flow rate, and reactor type. T1 mixer had the highest conversion rate of 97% for a residence time of 80 s and methanol to oil molar ratio of 9:1. It was attributed to the smaller internal dimensions and lower interfacial area, leading to smaller slugs [131]. Sun et al. obtained a FAME yield of 98.80% using micro-fluidic mixed with 0.25 mm capillary microreactor for a residence time of 6 min. The fluid was already mixed in the batch reactor and yielded 81% before the fluid entered the microreactor [82]. Guan et al. used T-type and split and recombined micromixers for the transesterification of sunflower oil. The split and recombined micromixers had a higher yield than the T-mixer for a residence time of 112 s [124]. With a shorter residence time of 14.9 s, the zig-zag microchannel had a yield of 99.5% in the transesterification of soyabean oil [143]. 5.4.3 Effect of internal configuration Advection is another significant type of mass transfer apart from diffusion in a microfluidic system. Alcohol and oil mixing can be significantly improved with chaotic advection. Chaotic advection can be implemented either by improvements in channel configuration or by introducing an obstruction in the channel for passive mixing in microchannels [144]. Aghel et al. inserted a wire coil in the microreactor to improve mixing efficiency [145]. In comparison with the previous work of Aghel et al., the inserted wire coil microreactor had a higher conversion rate than the simple T-shaped microreactor under similar conditions. Another comparison was undertaken with and without using the static elements for mixing in a plain T-shaped microreactor [146]. It was observed that the microreactor with static elements had better mixing performance and biodiesel yield because of the induced changes in the flow direction, formation of a vortex, and disturbance in the boundary layer [147]. Dai et al. achieved 99.5% FAME in a few seconds using a zig-zag microreactor [143]. Martinez et al. investigated the effect of channel configuration on castor oil transesterification with an alkali-catalyst using T-shaped, Telsa shaped and Omega shaped microreactors. The chaotic flow helped the Telsa and Omega microreactors have better ester yield than the T-shaped microreactor due to the higher contact area between the oil and alcohol phase [148]."
21,Post-treatment of biodiesel,"To maintain the quality of biodiesel, various standards are maintained. The quality standards for biodiesel such as ASTM D6751 and EN14214 describe biodiesel's chemical composition and properties as an alternative fuel [149]. Biodiesel should be free from impurities that can damage engine parts when deposited in the nozzles and form incrustations, causing corrosion. Due to the reaction, the impurities are mainly from feedstock matter, unsaponifiable materials, catalyst residues, glycerol, water, and excess alcohol [150]. Such impurities are removed to maintain biodiesel quality. The presence of methanol decreases density, viscosity, flash point and corrodes parts of zinc and aluminum. Glycerol may affect engine durability and block the injector due to the deposition of gum at the bottom of the fuel tank. The presence of water in biodiesel can cause enormous problems such as hydrolysis of methyl ester, microbiological growth leading to blockage of filters, corrosion of fuel tubes, and combustion heat reduction [151]. Several post-treatment methods are available such as membrane extraction, distillation, wet washing, and dry washing to remove impurities from biodiesel. The most commonly used methods in the industry are wet and dry washing methods in recent years [152]."
22,Wet washing,"6.1 Wet washing Wet washing is a common method employed to remove impurities from biodiesel. The efficiency of wet washing is well established. However, it has certain disadvantages, including the production of contaminated liquid effluents, loss of the final product, and emulsion formation if biodiesel is produced from high water content oil and FFA [153]. Wet washing is done by adding a fixed amount of water with continuous agitation to eliminate the formation of an emulsion. The above step is repeated until the water becomes colorless, showing the complete elimination of impurities. Wet washing is mainly done with deionized water, aqueous 5% phosphoric acid solution, and a mixture of organic solvent and water [152]. The presence of acid in the wash helps neutralize the catalyst and soap formed is decomposed. Finally, biodiesel is again washed with water to remove other impurities [154]. Huerga et al. used neutral water in the first step of washing, then with acidified water in the second step and finally with pure water [155]. Wet washing was used for washing crude biodiesel produced from heterogeneous catalyst reactions. Depending on the heterogeneous catalyst used in transesterification, the efficiency of wet washing varied. Water washing is not preferable for reactions that use calcium-based catalysts such as calcium oxide. This is due to the strong formation of calcium soaps that dissolve into crude biodiesel [156]. On the contrary, water washing is suitable for other heterogeneous catalysts used for transesterification [157]. Glycerol and methanol were removed efficiently from crude biodiesel due to their high solubility in water [158]. Predojevic experimented on the purification of crude biodiesel obtained from WCO using two methods: aqueous 5% phosphoric acid and hot distilled water. Washing with 5% phosphoric acid had a yield of 92% esters while hot distilled water achieved only 89% ester. After purification, biodiesel had the standard norms on acidity, density, kinematic viscosity, and iodine concentration [152,159]."
23,Dry washing,"6.2 Dry washing The main aim of dry washing techniques is to make water free purification process that is eco-friendly and conserves water. Impurities are removed from crude biodiesel with the aid of waterless agents: acid resin and absorbents [160]. The agents are generally used as suspended matter in a stirred crude biodiesel vessel or as a fixed column bed through which the biodiesel flows. If it is used in a suspended manner, the agents get collected after treatment by filtration. Dry washing removes impurities from crude biodiesel through adsorption, filtration, ion exchange, and glycerol/soap interaction [161]. Depending on the process conditions and agent property, one or another mechanism will be more efficient. Since waterless washing agents can remove all glycerol and methanol, they need to be removed at the gravitational separation stage [159]. Biodiesel is washed with distilled water in a stirred tank to increase the purity of the product. From the aqueous phase, ester is then removed by decantation and outgassed [162]. The absorbents used are magnesol, amberlite, purolite, silicagel, and activated carbon which attract polar substances with acidic and basic sites [163]. Sabudak and Yildiz used magnesol and purolite ion exchange to remove impurities from waste cooking oil biodiesel [164]. Commercial absorbent magnesol was used to refine crude biodiesel produced from soybean oil and beef tallow using ethanol and sulfonic resin. The absorbent was treated with biodiesel at 65 C with 2 wt% magnesol. The absorbent was obtained by filtration after stirring for 20 min [165,166]. For the purification of crude biodiesel, different cation-exchange resins are used, varying as functional groups (carboxylic or sulfonic), polymer matrix (macro-reticular or gelular), and counter-cation (Na+ or H+). In extracting alkali soaps from crude biodiesel obtained by homogeneously alkali-catalyzed transesterification, using cation-exchange resins is equivalent to water cleaning, but more effective than the magnesol treatment [167]. However, water washing (96%) obtained a higher biodiesel yield than using a cation exchange resin (92%) since a portion of biodiesel remained in the column after purification [150]."
24,Practical implications of the study,"The quantity of biodiesel produced from a single micro-reactor unit is insufficient to satisfy industrial manufacturing rates. As a result, scaling up micro-reactor units is highly desirable, and this can be accomplished by utilizing the numbering-up approach. Multiple, parallel repetitions of micro-reactor units can be employed to enhance the quantity and quality of the biodiesel without affecting microfluidic flow parameters is known as numbering-up. The notion of numbering-up becomes critical in demonstrating the microreactor's industrial relevance [168]. Because of their ease of use, homogeneous catalysts are currently preferred in hydrodynamic reactors. The suitable heterogeneous catalysts and cosolvent-assisted transesterification will alleviate the problem of high FFA biodiesel feedstocks while also lowering alcohol and catalyst needs. Mixing the reagents is most important to reduce the reaction time; similarly, mixing techniques can increase energy consumption, so it is most important to have an energy-efficient reactor system [169]. Usage of reactors in conjunction with additional intensification has an advantage; the use of microwave, ultrasonic wave techniques can improve the reaction rate. On the other hand, commercial microwave reactors operate at a frequency of 2.45 GHz, which may not suit large-scale biodiesel processing due to its poor penetration depth. As a result, microwave-assisted biodiesel reactors are limited to small batch processing, posing a scaling problem and producing sluggish biodiesel [141]."
25,Limitations of the study,"The fabrication of a microchannel reactor is influenced by material selection because materials such as polymethylmethacrylate, polysulfone, polycarbonate, Teflon, acrylic, and others when exposed to reactants/products for lengthy periods of time, which may create stress cracks at the joints. Fouling is an inescapable problem in microchannel reactors, regardless of the materials employed in their construction. It has an impact on the material's durability and lifespan. To overcome the difficulties by fouling, studies have to be made since there is not much importance given for the research related to microreactor fouling issues [23]. Billo et al. suggested that joint leakage between every module of parallelizing microreactors for biodiesel synthesis has to be arrested since it is composed of high-density polyethylene and full-scale microreactors [170]. It is difficult to determine an effective technique to stop leakage between every module with mechanical fasteners and rubber gaskets for long-term use; thus, more study is needed to develop reliable materials. The mixers' primary goal is to ensure that the immiscible phases are as homogeneous as possible before the entry of channels in promoting molecular interactions. The selection of an appropriate micromixer reduces reaction time and is determined by the feed and catalyst properties [92]. Another significant problem is online flow analysis or monitoring flow analysis associated with large-scale production. To have precise regulation of the operation, an automated monitoring system is required. Another challenge is immobilizing catalysts on the microchannel surface while maintaining their catalytic activity. Due to practical constraints, research on the utilization of heterogeneous catalysts has not been investigated fully in microchannel reactors. The reaction rate is affected by the mass transfer constraints correlated with immiscible phases and catalysts. As a result, more research in this area is required. The major issue with biodiesel synthesis using high FFA oil in microchannel reactors is soap formation during the reaction that affects biodiesel's physicochemical qualities and output. As a result, appropriate feedstock pre-treatment is required to overcome the restrictions above-mentioned. As a result, selecting an appropriate, efficient, and cost-effective pre-treatment method is critical. In order to obtain a higher yield, it is also vital to maintain a uniform temperature distribution inside the channel."
26,Future directions,"The production of biodiesel using various types of continuous flow reactors was illustrated in the literature review. Among continuous reactors, microchannel reactors had more potential and great scope for the future. Microchannel reactors ranging from small-scale to large-scale will greatly impact commercialization. As microchannel reactors are compact, they can be modified as portable reactors and easily transported. In addition to these, microreactors combined with various assisted processes can drive the yield of biodiesel higher for which the production process is discussed below."
27,Combined ultrasound and microreactor,"9.1 Combined ultrasound and microreactor Thangarasu et al. investigated the continuous production of biodiesel using a microreactor with the aid of ultrasonic mixing. The copper coil microreactor with diameters 0.3 and 0.8 mm was used for the transesterification reaction of Aegle Marmelos Correa seed oil with methanol and sodium methoxide catalyst. The experiment was conducted with the following parameters: ultrasonic mixing time (30–150 s), oil to alcohol molar ratio (1:6–1:18), amount of catalyst (0.5–2.5 wt%), reaction temperature (45–65 °C) and flow rate (2–10 mL/min) with the assistance of response surface methodology. The results showed the optimum parameters of ultrasonic mixing time (83 s), oil to alcohol molar ratio (1:9), amount of catalyst (1.3 wt%), reaction temperature (48 °C) and flow rate (6.8 mL/min) provided a yield of 98%. Reactors of 0.3 and 0.8 mm showed a maximum yield of 98% and 91.8%. Ultrasonic mixing enhanced the mixing properties of oil and methanol through cavitation and resulted in a better emulsion. The microreactor improved the reaction's heat transfer rate. n. The synergetic effects discussed above led the system have a higher biodiesel yield at a shorter residence time [171]. Thus, the combination of ultrasonics with microreactor has a more significant impact on biodiesel production and needs future research."
28,Combined microwave and microreactor,"9.2 Combined microwave and microreactor The combination of microwave reactor and microreactor is still intact. In recent years, microwave irradiation has been used in a microreactor for the synthesis of chemical compounds. This combination holds great potential for the future with certain modifications to match biodiesel production parameters. Microwave intensification can be used for mixing reactants and improving mass transfer in less time [172]."
29,Stacked microreactor,"9.3 Stacked microreactor Microreactor studies about their geometries and variation of process parameters for the improved reaction are mainly studied. But most research is not focused on the increment of biodiesel with microreactor technology. For conversion of large production rates, microreactors should be grouped or scaled up to impact mass production [173]. Numbering up is a method of multiplication of individuals in a parallel connection [174]. Nattee et al. studied a microreactor made up of stainless steel with a cross-sectional area of 0.5 × 0.5 m2 over a length of 1200 mm. The microreactor was designed to have 95321 plates numbered in parallel based on the conceptual design for scaling. Around 96 stacks of microreactor were designed in which each microchannel stack had 250 plates. Each plate had a 2 mm thickness, while inside the reactor, the spiral microchannel directed the reacting mixture for transesterification reaction. Refined bleached and deodorized palm oil was the source of triglycerides and 30% sodium methylate was used as a catalyst with methanol. Optimum conditions for the reaction were an oil to methanol molar ratio of 1:6, residence time of 5s, and reaction temperature of 65 °C. The flow rate of the raw material was 345,600 mL/min. Numbering up was made to ensure production of 20589.29 L/h which was comparatively large enough to be compared with industrial-scale production. The conceptual design was compared to the industrial scale, and energy consumption and area requirements for the microreactor system were found to be more efficient than in the conventional system. The possibility of risk incidents/accidents was also less in the microreactor system [175]."
30,Techno-economic analysis,"9.4 Techno-economic analysis Biodiesel production has certain limits in terms of energy and environmental problems. Hence, to address these issues, many scientific approaches were utilized. The exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental analysis is one of the important analyses in assessing various process parameters of the transesterification reaction [176,177]. Life cycle assessment is a bioenergy assessment tool used in evaluating and quantifying the environmental impacts of energy systems [178]. It is necessary to develop analytic techniques to assess biodiesel production systems' exergy, economic and environmental effects to identify a prominent and efficient continuous-flow microreactors system [179]. The various mathematical modeling software such as Aspen Plus, Minitab, GITT, ANSYS ICEM, and CFD analysis can be used to study process intensification kinetics and thermodynamic analysis using microchannel reactors. However, the experimental validation of simulation results has practical limitations due to difficulties with collecting data at different time intervals inside the microchannel reactor. Furthermore, the major disadvantage of using heterogeneous catalysts in microreactors is the fine channel spacing blockage. The nanocatalyst coated microreactors or printed circuit type microreactors can be employed with impurities/particles free oil and alcohol to synthesis biodiesel."
31,Conclusions,"Biodiesel has gained much traction in recent years due to the instability of crude oil prices. Despite the direct effect of crude oil on the growth of biodiesel technologies, many biodiesel-related research projects are still subject to fluctuations. Further various aspects of biodiesel development methodologies continue to pose challenges, such as mass transfer limitations, long residence times, scalability of the technology, and expensive instrumentation. Biodiesel production using a continuous flow process has better potential than batch reactors due to its enhanced reaction rates and yield properties. Among the various continuous flow reactor technologies, microreactors are a better option. In microreactors, heat and mass transfer are greatly accelerated due to small diffusion distances and a wide surface area to volume ratio, resulting in higher conversions in shorter residence periods. Also, the flow regime and geometrical configuration of micro-reactors have a direct influence on biodiesel yield. Shorter channel dimensions result in shorter diffusion distances between reactant molecules, thus increasing mass transfer. However, since small channel dimensions can result in low throughput, advection can be used to speed up transesterification reaction by better mixing of oil and alcohol. Further, the inlet mixer structure influences biodiesel yield due to their various dimensions and the flow activity at the mixers’ outlets. The surface area to volume ratio is determined by the nature of flow between two phases. The droplet-based flow outperforms other continuous-flow development methods. However, some issues need to be addressed for biodiesel production in micro-reactors, such as numbering micro-reactors from lab to pilot scale, design, and construction of combined micro-reactors with advanced techniques. Also, continuous biodiesel purification with an integrated microfluidic system is still in the process of research. To meet the quality requirements, different designs and surface modifications of microfluidic devices are required."
