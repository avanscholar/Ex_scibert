0,Introduction,"Photocatalysts could convert solar energy into chemical energy by producing hydrogen gas from hydrogen-containing compounds. Thus hydrogen production with semiconductor photocatalysts has recently received much attention due to the potential of H2 as an alternative fuel [1–5]. Loading a cocatalyst onto a semiconductor photocatalyst is required to lower the overvoltage for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution systems. The cocatalyst also suppresses the recombination of photogenerated charges in the photocatalyst by efficient removal of photoelectrons from the charge generation sites, and provides the catalytic sites for the reduction of H+ as shown schematically in Fig. 1 . The charge recombination is the main cause of efficiency loss in photocatalysis because some of the absorbed photoenergy is wasted as useless fluorescence light or heat. Transition metals and their oxides have been employed as cocatalysts including Pt [6–9], Rh [10,11], NiO [12], RuO2 [13–15], IrO2 [16], and Rh/Cr2O3 [5]. The cocatalysts are loaded on the surface of semiconductor photocatalysts to enhance the rate of hydrogen and oxygen production from water, or the rate of hydrogen production from aqueous solution of a sacrificial reagent. More popular and more efficient cocatalysts are noble metals such as Pt, Rh, and Ru, which are very expensive and in limited supply. Thus, it is highly desired to find a less expensive alternative cocatalyst. One possible approach is to utilize the metallic compounds with similar properties to those of noble metals. We have identified one such metallic compound, tungsten carbide, which can serve this purpose. Transition metal carbides have been studied extensively as new catalytic materials because of their interesting physicochemical and catalytic properties, which resemble those of noble metals [17–20]. Tungsten carbides, in particular, also have been studied as electrocatalysts [21–24]. Recently, we have demonstrated that tungsten carbide could be utilized as an electrocatalyst of high catalytic activity for methanol oxidation [25,26]. To our best knowledge, there is only one previous report that used metal carbides as cocatalysts of photocatalysts. Thus, Oosawa investigated the photocatalytic hydrogen production over TiO2 powders loaded with transition metal borides, nitrides, phosphides, and carbides from an aqueous methanol solution and compared the activities with those of precious metal-loaded TiO2 powders under ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation [27]. Among these compound cocatalysts, tungsten carbide showed the highest activity. However, its activity was found to be only about one-fifth of that of Pt. The observed low activity was attributed to the difficulty involved in loading larger WC particles onto the smaller TiO2 particles by grinding. We thought that the capability of tungsten carbide as a cocatalyst was not fully manifested in this work due to inadequate properties of the WC sample derived from high temperature ceramic processes. Thus, we first prepared WC nanoparticles according to the procedure that we reported previously [25,26]. Then we fabricated WC/CdS composite material by a precipitation method, followed by hydrothermal treatment that allowed an intimate contact between two phases. Finally, we measured the photocatalytic activity of this composite material for hydrogen production from an aqueous solution containing sulfide and sulfite as hole scavengers under visible light irradiation (using a cutoff filter of λ ≥420nm)."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of CdS nanoparticles,"2.1 Preparation of CdS nanoparticles The CdS photocatalyst was prepared by a precipitation method, followed by hydrothermal treatment. A stoichiometric amount of Na2S aqueous solution was added drop-by-drop to Cd(NO3)2 dissolved in isopropyl alcohol. Each precipitated suspension was hydrothermally treated in an autoclave at 150°C for 3 days. After the completion of the reaction, the precipitates were filtered and washed several times with deionized water. Filtered powders were dried at 70°C for 5h in a convection oven."
3,Preparation of WC nanoparticles,"2.2 Preparation of WC nanoparticles Tungsten mono-carbide (WC) nanoparticles were obtained by heating a mixture of resorcinol and formaldehyde with ammonium metatungstate (AMT) as a tungsten source and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a surfactant. Thus, 18mmol of CTAB was dissolved in 20ml deionized water and the mixture was stirred vigorously for 30min. Then a solution containing 1.7mmol of AMT, 1.1mmol of resorcinol, and 2.2mmol of formaldehyde was added to the CTAB solution. The resulting precursor gel was autoclaved at 150°C for 2 days. The final red polymer containing tungsten source was dried at 80°C and calcined at 900°C for 1h under argon flow of 68μmol/s and for an additional 2h under hydrogen at the same flow rate. Then, ammonia gas treatment was carried out to remove any free carbon which covered the tungsten carbide surface for 8h under ultra high purity ammonia flow. Detailed procedures for precursor synthesis and carbonization were described elsewhere [25,26]."
4,Preparation of WC/CdS composite,"2.3 Preparation of WC/CdS composite To fabricate CdS photocatalyst combined with WC, we tried a one-pot synthesis in isopropyl alcohol through a precipitation method, the prepared powder was hydrothermally treated in an autoclave at 150°C for 24h. After completion of the reaction, the precipitate was filtered and washed several times with deionized water. Filtered powder was dried at 70°C for 5h in a convection oven."
5,Preparation of Pt/CdS photocatalysts,"2.4 Preparation of Pt/CdS photocatalysts For in situ photodeposition of Pt onto CdS, as-synthesized CdS photocatalyst was added in aqueous solution containing a required amount (2.0wt%) of H2PtCl6. The solution was then illuminated for 2h with visible light (λ ≥420nm), filtered and then dried in a static oven. The material was used as a reference photocatalyst."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization The phase formation and crystallinity of the products were determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique on a diffractometer (Mac Science Co., M18XHF) with monochromatic Cu Kα radiation at 40kV and 200mA. The optical properties were analyzed using UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectrometer (Shimadzu, UV 2401). The morphology of the photocatalysts was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi, S-4200) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The JEOL JEM 2100F Field Emission Electron Microscope instrument was operated at 200kV."
7,Electrochemical test,"2.6 Electrochemical test The working electrodes were prepared via dispersing the catalyst in 1ml of distilled water and 10μl of 5wt% Nafion. The dispersed solution was ultrasonicated for 20min. A known amount of suspension was mounted on to the glassy carbon electrode and solvent was evaporated. 10μl of 5wt% Nafion was again added on the coatings and solvent was slowly evaporated. Pt wire and Ag/AgCl/3M NaCl were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. All potentials are translated to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The sweep rate of CV is 20mV/s. A solution of N2-purged 1M H2SO4 solution was used for cyclic voltammetry, which were performed on a Princeton Applied Research (PAR) voltammetry."
8,Photocatalytic reaction procedures,"2.7 Photocatalytic reaction procedures The photocatalytic reactions were carried out at room temperature under normal pressure in a closed photoreactor using a Hg-arc lamp (500W) equipped with an infrared liquid filter and a UV cut off filter (λ ≥420nm). The H2 evolution was determined for an aqueous solution (100ml) containing 0.1g catalyst and 0.1M Na2S+0.02M Na2SO3. The evolved amounts of H2 were determined by gas chromatography analysis (thermal conductivity detector, molecular sieve 5-Å column and Ar carrier)."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Characterization of WC/CdS composite photocatalyst,"3.1 Characterization of WC/CdS composite photocatalyst The powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples prepared with different amounts of WC in WC/CdS composite photocatalyst are shown in Fig. 2 . The pure CdS was prepared by precipitation, followed by hydrothermal treatment at 150°C for 24h. The material exhibited a well-developed hexagonal phase with high crystallinity. In the composite photocatalyst containing WC fabricated under the same condition, the crystallinity of CdS was lowered, as shown in Fig. 2a–c. Thus it appears that WC could inhibit the growth of CdS particles. When the weight ratio of WC to CdS was increased, the presence of the hexagonal WC phase became clear, as shown in Fig. 2c. The typical XRD pattern of WC sample shown in Fig. 2e corresponded to WC of a simple hexagonal phase with lattice parameters of a =2.906Å and c =2.83Å (JCPDS card no. 12070-12-1) [25,26]. Application of the Scherrer equation to this XRD pattern yielded a crystal size of WC of ca. 5nm, which is consistent with the particle size estimated from its BET surface area of 76m2/g. In Fig. 3 , the overpotentials of pure WC and 20wt% Pt/C (E-Tek) electrodes for hydrogen evolution are −0.05V (RHE) and −0.02V (RHE), respectively. It is interesting that pure WC shows an overpotential comparable with that of 20wt% Pt/C (E-Tek). The specific activity for hydrogen evolution of pure WC is 37mA/cm2 at the low potential of −0.2V (RHE). These electrochemical properties reveal that WC can play a role as an effective cocatalyst to reduce the proton and to evolve hydrogen. Fig. 4 shows the UV–vis diffuse reflectance (UV-DR) spectra of pure CdS and of the composite WC/CdS samples with different concentrations of tungsten carbide. The shapes and the positions of absorption edges did not change much. But, as the amount of WC in composite increases, their absorption intensity is reduced. WC does not show any absorption in this wavelength range, as shown in Fig. 4e. Thus it appears that WC in composite samples partly blocks the light absorption by CdS. The morphologies of WC, CdS, and 10wt% WC/CdS particles were observed by the SEM and TEM images shown in Fig. 5 . The morphology of WC was irregular spherical particles of ca. 50nm, whereas CdS particles were agglomerates of nanosized particles of ca. 30–40nm with no distinctive morphological features. These CdS and WC particles were not discernable in the composite photocatalyst as shown in Fig. 5c. To observe the distribution of WC cocatalyst and CdS particle in the composite particles, we analyzed TEM images and X-ray mapping of each element (e.g. Cd, S and W) in Fig. 6 . From the result of X-ray mapping obtained from TEM images, we can confirm that the WC/CdS image seen by TEM is made up of contributions from each element of W, Cd, and S in the composite and that the WC cocatalyst is well mixed with CdS particles, showing a good dispersion in the composite material. There is no severely segregated WC phase. Carbon was also detected, but its distribution was not correlated with the TEM image. The carbon signal comes from WC as well as from the carbon grid, for TEM analysis. Thus we did not display a carbon map in Fig. 6."
11,Photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production from an aqueous Na2S/Na2SO3 solution,"3.2 Photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production from an aqueous Na2S/Na2SO3 solution We investigated the dependence of the photocatalytic activity on the amount of WC contained in WC/CdS composite photocatalyst for hydrogen production, as shown in Fig. 7A. The reaction was performed with an aqueous solution containing 0.1M Na2S and 0.02M Na2SO3 as sacrificial reagents under visible light irradiation (λ ≥420nm). The main reaction is the reduction of protons in the solution to hydrogen by photoelectrons: (1) 2H+ +2e− →H2 The holes are consumed to oxidize sulfide ion to elemental sulfur: (2) S2− +2h+ →S This elemental sulfur could poison the catalyst and thus is converted to soluble thiosulfate ion by a reaction with the sulfite ion: (3) S+SO3 2− →S2O3 2− These sulfur species could be further oxidized to sulfate by reaction with hydroxyl group in the water. For CdS photocatalyst combined with 2wt% WC, the rate of hydrogen production increases by a factor of 7.5 compared to that of CdS photocatalyst without any cocatalyst. The photocatalytic activity of CdS photocatalyst loaded with 10wt% WC increases by a factor of 23. As the amount of WC on CdS increases, the photocatalytic activity increases as well. From this result we can conclude that WC can act as a cocatalyst for CdS photocatalyst in hydrogen production just as effectively as Pt. The time courses of hydrogen production are shown in Fig. 7B. CdS photocatalyst combined with 10wt% WC showed a stable rate of hydrogen production during photocatalytic reactions. We compared the photocatalytic activity of 2wt% Pt-loaded CdS sample prepared by photochemical method with that of 10wt% WC/CdS composite photocatalyst. The 2wt% Pt/CdS photocatalyst showed a little higher rate of hydrogen production than that of 10wt% WC/CdS composite photocatalyst. But it is remarkable that WC/CdS showed a photocatalytic activity comparable to that of the best known Pt/CdS photocatalyst for hydrogen production under visible light. Considering its lower cost and ready availability, yet comparable activity, we can conclude that WC has strong potential to be used as a cocatalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Compared to the previous system of Oosawa [27], the superior activity of the WC/CdS photocatalyst in this study is considered to be due to the properties of the present material being more suitable to play the role of a cocatalyst. Several factors appear responsible for the excellent performance of our WC/CdS sample, as inferred in other composite photocatalysts [28–31]. The commercial WC samples have BET surface areas usually less than 1m2/g because they are produced by a high temperature ceramic processing method. Their surfaces are usually contaminated with polymeric carbon. The higher surface area of WC nanoparticles means a smaller particle size and an increased interfacial area between WC and CdS particles. The intimate contact between WC and CdS brought about by the precipitation/hydrothermal synthesis method of the composite material can facilitate the charge transfer between two phases. This intimate contact would not be achieved by the physical grinding employed by Oosawa [27]. As mentioned, a cocatalyst efficiently separates photogenerated electrons and holes in the photocatalyst, reduces the chance of their recombination, and provides active sites for proton reduction, as schematically represented in Fig. 8B. All these processes are not efficient in CdS alone without a cocatalyst, as shown in Fig. 8A. There is room for further improvement in the synthesis to make smaller WC nanoparticles and to fabricate better WC/CdS composite material. With this improvement, it is expected that WC could become a competitive cocatalyst for photocatalysts as efficient as more expensive noble metals such as Pt, Pd, or Au. Another valuable result is that platinum-like behavior of WC has been demonstrated in photocatalysis as well as in chemical catalysis."
12,Conclusions,"The WC/CdS composite photocatalyst was successfully fabricated for the first time via a precipitation and hydrothermal method. The WC/CdS photocatalyst showed excellent photocatalytic activity, comparable to that of conventional Pt/CdS for hydrogen production from water under visible light irradiation. Platinum-like WC plays a role as active site for proton reduction and also causes fast diffusion of photoelectrons generated from CdS nanoparticles toward WC nanoparticles, leading to high photocatalytic activity of hydrogen production. Therefore, WC could become an alternative cocatalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen production."
