0,Introduction,"Lignin, as the second most abundant alternative energy source, exhibits tremendous potential for the sustainable production of liquid fuels and valuable organic chemicals [1,2], while the catalytic conversion of lignin for the sustainable production of value-added chemicals is still challenging due to its structural complexity [3]. Hence, lignin model compounds (LMCs), simpler molecules that represent some of the functional groups or linkages of lignin, are usually employed as useful starting materials to study the conversion processes and underlying mechanisms. Veratryl alcohol (VA) oxidation to its corresponding aromatic chemicals, represents the main conversion product obtained from the cleavage of β-O-4 model compounds [4], so VA has been often used as a model compound to investigate reaction pathways of lignin oxidation. Although the selective conversion of LMCs, such as veratryl alcohol (VA) is able to be achieved in the presence of catalysts, including metal catalyst [5–7], enzymes [8,9], and many others, the poor catalytic stability and reusability, and high preparation cost of these catalysts limit their application in practice. Therefore, at present the utilization of lignin model compounds as starting materials to develop efficient and inexpensive conversion approaches for valuable aromatic chemicals is still necessary [10–12]. Light-induced conversion of lignocellulose and model compounds via enzymatic catalysis or pigment photosensitization is a promising new approach for biomass refining and the sustainable production of chemicals [13–16]. Although sensitized photooxidation of lignin residues has been investigated based on heterogeneous photocatalysis involving the use of semiconductor materials such as TiO2 [17], few studies have concerned the conversion of LMCs by photosynthetic pigment photosensitization. Chlorophyllin, the photosynthetic green pigment, is essential component of the reaction centre complexes needed for photosynthetic light harvesting, which is considered to be one of the most potent electron donors in nature due to the strong light-absorbance properties of pigments. Recently, the light-driven oxidation of lignocellulose fractionation combined with photosynthetic pigments has drawn high levels of attention. The activity of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMO) drastically increased, a hundred-fold, in a light-driven system, where chlorophyllin combined with a reductant and donated high redox potential electrons to LPMO [18]. The chlorophyllin, which contains magnesium, copper, and zinc, was able to behave as photosensitizers in photocatalysis processes [19]. Therefore, light-induced systems coupled with photosensitizers like photosynthetic reactions, are liable to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as singlet oxygen (1O2), the hydroxyl radical (OH), and superoxide radical ion (O2 −). However, the role of reactive oxygen species, generated via the photosensitization of light-excited pigments, in the oxidation of non-phenolic lignin compounds in light-driven systems is still controversial. Reactive oxygen species photo-generated by pigment photosensitization are thought to be primarily involved in the oxidation of lignin and model compounds, but little is known about the conversion performance and reaction mechanisms [16]. Nevertheless, we still can learn some chemical reaction properties from ROS oxidation reaction with lignin-derived dissolved organic matter (NOM) [20]. It has been well-established that each reactive oxygen species is expected to vary substantially in its reactivity with lignin- derived NOM in the photochemical alteration process in water environment [21–23]. Previous works showed that transformation of NOM by 1O2 led to the production of O-containing aliphatic formulas [24]. Furthermore, evidence suggests that electrophilic 1O2 can react with dienes and olefins through cycloaddition to produce cyclic peroxides [25,26]. However, OH is an unselective oxidant and primarily reacts with NOM through addition to unsaturated bonds or aromatic compounds, H-abstraction, and electron transfer reactions, making for the formation of carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM) [27,28]. OH induced electron transfer reactions are capable of producing organic radical cation species, which can further lead to dimerization reactions [29]. O2 −, with relatively long-lived life, is able to react with a range of moieties [30,31]. One-electron reduction of organic compounds is commonly observed with O2 −, as well as reactions with catechol-like compounds, resulting in ring cleavage and polymerisation through radical anion reactions [31,32]. Despite strong evidence in support of the importance of ROS in transforming the chemical composition of NOM in photochemical process, the role of ROS that are photochemically produced from pigments in the degradation of high redox potential non-phenolic LMCs in light-driven pigment systems has never been clearly demonstrated. This motivated us to explore economic lignin model compound oxidation approachs and underlying mechanisms when light-driven photosynthetic pigment was applied to the oxidation of LMCs. In this work, we set up a simple light-driven system consisting of photosynthetic pigment chlorophyllin and veratryl alcohol as substrate. The photocatalytic performance of high potential redox VA conversion and involved mechanisms were investigated to understand the effect of the light-driven pigment system for lignin utilization. Irradiation experiments and products analysis were performed to determine VA conversion performance and converted products. Photoelectrochemical analysis of chlorophyllin was carried out to explore the variation of its redox status under irradiation. Quenching experiments were performed to determine the role of dominant reactive oxygen species involved in the light-driven process."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Veratryl alcohol, chlorophyllin sodium copper salt, furfuryl alcohol (FFA) and 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (TMP, Fluka, 99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The chlorophyllin solution (12% w/v, 166 mM) was prepared by dissolving the powder in water (MilliQ-quality) and was stored in darkness at 4 °C. All the stock solutions were incubated in darkness for 2 h at room temperature. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbic acid, benzene, phenol, phosphoric acid, methanol, and acetone were purchased from Aladdin. Sodium azide (NaN3), tertiary butanol (TBA), and 1,4-benzoquinone (p-BQ) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as scavengers for 1O2, OH, and O2 −, respectively, which were produced during irradiation processes."
3,Photochemical experiments,"2.2 Photochemical experiments 2.2.1 Oxidation of veratryl alcohol Photochemical experiments were performed in a photochemical reaction apparatus (Nanjing Xujing, China) with a 500 W xenon lamp and a cooling water jacket [33]. The light-driven oxidation reactions of VA were conducted at 30 ± 2 °C in the photochemical reaction apparatus. Chlorophyllin (1.66 μΜ) was added to the VA (10 μΜ) solution with 0.5 mM ascorbic acid and a phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) in a 10 ml quartz reactor. The suspension was equilibrated in a dark condition for 10 min prior to irradiation. The oxidation reaction of the as-prepared samples was evaluated under illumination with a 365 nm cutoff filter (UV), a 420 nm cutoff filter (Vis), and no cutoff filter (sunlight), respectively. The darkness controls were wrapped in aluminium foil. Samples were collected at given intervals and immediately filtered through a 0.22 μM filter for further analysis. All the experiments presented were conducted in triplicate, and the results were presented as the way of mean plus/minus standard deviation. The degree of VA oxidation was determined by the quantification of VA and oxydate veratraldehyde after 4 h reactions, which was performed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Primaide, Hitachi Ltd, Japan), equipped with a C18 column. The samples were eluted with acetonitrile (ACN)-water (20/80, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml min−1 and detected at a wavelength of 278 nm. The conversion of VA and the yield of oxydate veratraldehyde were defined as follows: (1) Conversion % = C 0 - C VA / C 0 × 100 (2) Yield % = C aldehyde / C 0 × 100 where C0 is the initial concentration of VA, CVA is the substrate VA concentration, and Caldehyde is the concentration of aldehyde. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS-8060) was performed order to confirm veratraldehyde as the oxidation product coupling a Nexera UHPLC system to an AB-SCIEX 5600 Triple TOF mass spectrometer in positive and high-sensitivity mode. For the LC analysis, the column, mobile phase, detection, and flow rate were identical to those for the HPLC analysis described above. The elution program was as follows: 0–60% acetonitrile for 10 min, 60–100% acetonitrile for 1 min, and 100% acetonitrile for 5 min. For the MS analysis, the parameters were: ion source gases GS1 (N2, 55 psi) and GS2 (N2, 55 psi) at a temperature of 600 °C, and the ion spray voltage floating was 5500 V. 2.2.2 Quenching experiments and ROS measurement The quenching experiments were carried out in order to investigate the contributory roles of ROS in the reactions. The radical scavengers, NaN3 (2 mM), TBA (2 mM) and p-BQ (2 mM), were added to the reaction systems. H2SO4 or NaOH were adopted to adjust pH. All the batch experiments were done in duplicate. The oxidation of VA was repeated three times to ensure stable results and the results presented were the mean of three samples, with the standard deviations presented as error bars. Samples were collected at given intervals and immediately filtered through a 0.22 μM filter for HPLC analysis. Furfuryl alcohol (FFA), was selected as a probe compound to measure and calculate the steady state concentration and formation rates of 1O2 [34]. A reversed-phase HPLC system (Primaide, Hitachi Ltd, Japan) coupled with a C18 column was used to quantify the FFA decay curves. Mobile phase is acetonitrile–water (18/82, v/v) as a flow rate of 0.8 ml min−1, and the determination wavelength (UV detecter) was 234 nm. The steady state concentration and formation rates of 1O2 were calculated following Eq. (3) and (4). (3) 1 O 2 = k obs / k FFA (4) R 1 O 2 = 1 O 2 SS × k d where kobs was pseudo first-order rate constants for FFA loss, kFFA is the reaction rate constant 1.2 × 108 M−1s−1 [35], kd is the deactivation of 1O2 by water (2.5 × 105 s−1) [34]. Benzene was selected as a probe coumpound to trap OH in solutions [36]. The phenol that was produced was measured using a HPLC (Primaide, Hitachi Ltd, Japan) coupled with a C18 column. Mobile phase is methanol–water (60/40, v/v) as a flow rate of 1 ml min−1, and the determination wavelength (UV detecter) was 268 nm. The formation rates of hydroxyl radical R OH, were calculated as follows: (5) R · OH = R phenol / r where r is the yield coefficient of phenol between benzene and OH, and r = 0.85 [37]. 2.2.3 Measurement of oxygen and chlorophyllin concentration The oxygen consumption was measured with three oxygen sensors (Optical Oxygen Meter FireSting, PyroScience GmbH, Aachen, Germany) at a temperature of 30 ± 2 °C and a 500 W xenon lamp was applied. The 10 ml reaction chamber was stirred by a magnet and equipped with a window for light exposure. It is important to note the headspace (3 ml) in reaction chambers that allows oxygen diffusion into the reaction. Reactants could be added via a capillary cannula at the top, and the reactants were added in a stepwise manner as follows: 1) ascorbic acid, VA, and phosphate buffer (pH 7) were initially added, 2) addition of chlorophyllin, 3) addition of superoxide dismutase (20 mg ml−1), resembling the light-driven chlorophyllin system in the presence of SOD. Then the complete photosystem (VA-chlorophyllin) was measured with alternating cycles of light/darkness without or with the pigment. From 0 to 1200 s light was supplied, while from 1200 to 2400 s these reactions were carried out in darkness. HPLC (Primaide, Hitachi Ltd, Japan) coupled with a C18 column was applied to determine the concentration variation of chlorophyllin after 4 h of light-driven oxidation. Mobile phase is acetonitrile–water (20/80, v/v) with a flow rate of 1 ml min−1, and the determination wavelength (UV detecter) was 400 nm. Samples were collected at given intervals and immediately filtered through a 0.22 μM filter for HPLC analysis. Three replicate experiments were performed and the results presented were the mean of three samples, with the standard deviations presented as error bars. 2.2.4 Photo-electrochemical measurements Electrochemical tests were carried out using an electrochemical workstation (CHI-620E, Chenhua, Shanghai, China) with a three-electrode chamber consisting of a glassy carbon working electrode (3.0 mm, glassy carbon), a counter electrode (platinum-wire), and a reference electrode (Ag/AgCl). The electrodes were polished in alumina suspension solutions prior to use, and then rinsed using deionized water. All solutions were degassed with high purity nitrogen prior to electrochemical measurements. A 500 W xenon lamp was applied in all the photo-electrochemical measurements. The chlorophyllin was prepared in phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.0). For differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), the parameters were as follows: Ei = −0.6 V; Ef = 0.4 V; pulse width, 200 ms, amplitude, 60 mV, potential increment, 6 mV. Linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) were measured within a potential of 0.2–0.8 V."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Selective conversion of VA to veratraldehyde in the light-driven system,"3.1 Selective conversion of VA to veratraldehyde in the light-driven system Lignin has a complicated structure consisting of phenolic and non-phenolic lignin substructures, with the latter constituting the major part of the network. The catalytic activity of the light-driven system was initially evaluated by the selective oxidation of VA to veratraldehyde under irradiation over different light wavelengths. In this study, xenon lamp was applied to simulate solar radiation. The light intensity in xenon lamp gradually decreases with the decrease of wavelength when the wavelength was below 420 nm. When the wavelength reached 310 nm, the light intensity decreased to zero. According to UV–Vis spectrum of chlorophyllin (Fig. S1), the maximum photo-absorption wavelength of chlorophyllin is about 400 nm, indicating that the selected wavelength 310–420 nm is probably able to excite chlorophyllin molecules and induce photochemical reactions. The degree of VA oxidation was represented by the conversion rate, which was defined as the percentage of substrate VA conversion. The conversion rate of VA, the yield of veratraldehyde, and the reaction selectivity over different samples were presented after 4 h of irradiation (Fig. 1 A). An irradiation of 310–420 nm induced the highest levels of VA conversion (76% ± 2%) after 4 h irradiation, with a 65% ± 4% yield of veratraldehyde, which could have been obtained by CH and OH bonds breaking in VA. The reactive selectivity of the sunlight-driven system was also the highest (approximately 85% ± 3%) overall. In contrast, under irradiation of Vis sources (>420 nm), the VA conversion was only 5% ± 6%. This could be due to the fact that the maximum absorbance that is required to excite the pigment chlorophyllin is approximately at 400 nm. Additionally, a photo-response experiment in the case of dark and light alternating further verified that light indirectly activated the oxidation of VA (data are not shown). We also observed that the extent of VA oxidation by a sunlight-driven system improved when chlorophyllin loading decreased from 166 to 16.6 and then to 1.66 μM (data are not shown). In addition, the oxidation product content of veratraldehyde steadily increased in a linear relationship with VA concentrations. The control experiments confirmed that VA was not degraded without the addition of chlorophyllin, which indicated that the degradation of VA by exposure to light alone was negligible (data are not shown). This result further demonstrated that the substrate VA was not accessible to direct photochemical degradation. The VA conversion rates in our study are much higher than those obtained through enzyme catalysis [7], metal catalysts [6], and even matal/graphene composites catalysts [5]. At the same time, the photochemical conversion approach in this study has the advantage of insensitivity to temperature, which ensures the stability of VA conversion performance. The reaction products in the light-driven process were further analyzed by HPLC and LC–MS/MS (Figs. 1B and 2 ). VA conversion follows a ping-pong mechanism, in which VA is considered to be oxidised to generate VA cation radicals through a single electron transfer (SET) process. VA radicals, formed through the deprotonation of cation radicals, are oxidised by reactive oxygen species to form veratraldehyde. In response to the presence of pigment chlorophyllin, a peak corresponding to veratraldehyde was clearly detected (Fig. 2). This was a representative result of LC-MS/MS analysis using reaction products in positive ionization mode. The molecular weight of veratrum standard is 166, so the product ions produced are 139 [M−28 + H]+, 124 [M−43+H]+ and 109 [M−58+H]+ (Fig. 2A). These ions could also be obtained by MS/MS analysis of chlorophyllin-VA reaction products, indicating that the main conversion of VA to veratraldehyde happened in the light-driven system (Fig. 2B)."
6,Oxygen consumption and variation of chlorophyllin concentrations in the light-driven system,"3.2 Oxygen consumption and variation of chlorophyllin concentrations in the light-driven system 3.2.1 Oxygen consumption Photoactivation chlorophyllin molecules are able to react with dissolved oxygen to produce reactive transient ROS or organic groups, which may in turn destroy the structure of substrate. In order to detect the hypothesized ROS, we measured the oxygen consumption and release after each component was gradually added to the light-driven system combined with chlorophyllin and SOD (Fig. 3 A). In this study, oxygen consumption rate is defined as the rate at which the substrate utilizes dissolved oxygen in the solution during the oxidation process of VA. Initially, oxygen was consumed at a relatively low rate when ascorbic acid and VA were present alone. When chlorophyllin was added, the rate of oxygen consumption was much higher, which can be explained by the transfer of electrons from photo-excited chlorophyllin to oxygen as a receptor and the further generation of reactive oxygen species. Therefore, a steady state oxygen level was reached when the rate of consumption was equal to the diffusion of oxygen from the headspace into the solution. The addition of SOD increased the steady-state oxygen concentration, namely a decrease in the rate of oxygen consumption was obtained. This could be attributed to SOD efficiently transforming a large fraction of superoxide into H2O2 and O2, thereby releasing more O2 [19]. This results indicated that reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide radical anion, were produced in the photosensitization reaction of excited chlorophyllin. The light–dark experiments further proved that the pigment-excited light system consumed molecular dioxygen and was light-dependent (Fig. 3B). The oxygen consumption was obtained during incubation in light or darkness: from 0 to 1200 s the reactions were carried out under illumination, while from 1200 to 2400 s the light source was turned off. After one cycle of light and darkness, oxygen consumption was rarely observed and there was no response to light in the absence of chlorophyllin. When chlorophyllin was added at 2400 s, oxygen was significantly consumed under illumination conditions, but no oxygen consumption in darkness. This result coincided with the former observation in Fig. 3A. The photosystem performance can be controlled by turning the light source on and off (Fig. 3B). A rapid oxygen consumption was achieved when the light was switched on. These observations were consistent with the results from the polysaccharides oxidation process, which was performed with the light-driven photosynthetic pigments combined with metalloenzyme LPMO [18]. In our work, the oxygen consumption was correlated with the generation of superoxide radical anion O2 −, which was produced via the capturing of the photo-excited electrons from the excited chlorophyllin by molecular dioxygen. 3.2.2 The variation of chlorophyllin concentrations during light-driven processes Chlorophyllin, a kind of sodium-copper salt, has several benificial properties as a ubiquitous water-soluble pigment [38]. Preliminary observations of the light-induced VA oxidation promotion raised the question of whether chlorophyllin was light-induced. Chlorophyllin itself can also be photo-oxidized to generate hydroxyl radicals, which potentially are powerful oxidants. However, a large number of control experiments examining all system components demonstrated that such reactions did not produce oxidation products (data not shown) and no chlorophyllin consumption was detected at various concentrations after 4 h reaction (Fig. 4 ). Thus, the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyllin served as an electron donor involved in the light-driven system. The light-excited pigment, and then excited-state pigment transferred electrons to molecular oxygen to form ROS, which could be responsible for the oxidation of the substrate (VA). Taking electrons from the reducing agent ascorbic acid, the pigment was further reduced and then available for a new cycle of excitation."
7,Chlorophyllin photosensitisation and ROS oxidation of veratryl alcohol,"3.3 Chlorophyllin photosensitisation and ROS oxidation of veratryl alcohol 3.3.1 Photoelectrochemical properties of chlorophyllin To further investigate the origins of the improved photocatalytic performance of light-driven pigment system for selective oxidation of VA, electrochemical analysis of chlorophyllin was carried out to explore the variation of redox status of chlorophyllin under light irradiation. Photosensitizers, such as chlorophyllin molecules, accept photons from light irradiation to turn into the excited state, which usually presents as a mixture of triplet states of diverse molecules that vary in their excited state energies and excited state redox potentials. Therefore, excited triple states are both better oxidants and better reductants than their ground states [39]. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is not suitable for the electrochemical analysis of chlorophyllin because the difference between the electrochemical signals of chlorophyllin in light and dark environments was hardly detectable (data not shown). Instead, more sensitive differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was adopted. Chlorophyllin showed two reductive DPV peaks, −0.62 V and −1.06 V, respectively, under illumination or dark condition (Fig. 5 A), which proved the stability of the electroreduction properties of chlorophyllin. The two reduction peaks are considered to be the single electron reduction of the carbonyl groups and porphyrin rings, respectively, which function as light harvesters in the chlorophyllin molecules. The singlet and triplet electromagnetically excited chlorophyllin energy is 1.85 eV and 1.33 eV, respectively, corresponding to the reduction potential of chlorophyllin in solution to excited chlorophyll at −1.07 V and −0.55 V, respectively [40]. Under the irradiation of a certain wavelength of light (above 400 nm), chlorophyllin molecules accept photons to turn into the excited state and transfer electrons to electrodes. These results were consistent with the electrochemical behavior of chlorophyllin in neutral phosphate aqueous solution. In general, the electroreduction of chlorophyllin in aqueous solution is carried out in two steps. The first step is the reduction of the porphyrin ring, followed by the reduction of the carboxyl group. Besides, H+ is no longer involved in the electroreduction process due to the fact that carboxyl groups in aqueous solution are easily protonated. It should be noted that, various metal chlorophylls have differences in electroreduction potentials. For the electroreduction of Cu-chlorophyll, the central metal ion Cu(Ⅱ) and porphyrin ring can be reduced simultaneously, whereas the reduction of Zn(Ⅱ) and Mg(Ⅱ) chlorophyll is only carried out on the porphyrin rings. Additionally, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) test was performed in the potential range of 0.2–0.8 V (versus Ag/AgCl) with light irradiation when scanning the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) curves for chlorophyllin (Fig. 5B). Consequently, the ORE current reached 3.8 and 2.7 μA/cm2 for the light-driven and dark systems at 0.8 V, respectively. The OER current had a significant increase in the high potential range (0.6–0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl), which was mainly due to the existence of photoelectron transferred from the excited chlorophyllin to the dissolved oxygen, assisting the electrochemical OER process. It was evident that the light-driven system involved much higher levels of electrons generation and transfer, which was further confirmed by the occurrence of photoelectrons transferring between excited chlorophyllin and oxygen in the presence of light. 3.3.2 The role of ROS in the oxidation process In general, a range of lignin-modifying enzymes, for instance, lignin peroxidase (LiP, EC 1.11.1.14) and versatile peroxidase (VP, EC 1.11.1.16), are capable of directly oxidising non-phenolic LMCs, such as VA [41]. These VA oxidases generally have a tryptophan residue in the vicinity of VA bound to the heme-binding site [42]. It is interesting that different types of free radicals are involved in the oxidation process at high redox potentials, such as hydroxyl radical (OH), carboxylate anion radical (CO −), and superoxide radical (O2 −). This suggests that alternative mechanisms are probably involved in the oxidation of non-phenolic lignin moieties. To further investigate the photocatalytic oxidation mechanism of VA to veratraldehyde, a sequence of controlled experiments was performed using different radical scavengers under light irradiation. In the quenching experiments, NaN3, TBA and p-BQ were used as scavengers for trapping 1O2, OH, and O2 −, respectively. As displayed in Fig. 6 A, the addition of TBA did not have any noticeable effect on the conversion of VA, demonstrating that OH was not the reactive species in the oxidation of VA. These results coincided with the comparable low formation rate, as well as the steady-state concentration of OH (shown in Table S1). Meanwhile, the conversion rate of VA in light-driven system reduced from 68.8% to 42.9% after 4 h illumination in the presence of NaN3. In addition, the reaction rate constant, k, (Table 1 ) for VA decreased from 0.0056 to 0.0048 min−1, indicating that 1O2 played a certain role in the light-driven oxidation of VA. Interestingly, upon the addition of p-BQ, the oxidation of VA was completely inhibited, and the reaction rate constant (k) for VA dramatically decreased to 0.0002 min−1 (Table 1). These results indicated that O2 − played a significant role in the process of the light-driven oxidation of VA. The suitable redox potential (0.89 V, vs SHE) of O2 − makes it a candidate for the selective oxidation [43]. It was reported that O2 − was formed by the reaction of O2 with the reduced electron acceptor generated by the transfer of intramolecular electrons in the chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) from an excited singlet-electron donor to a ground-state electron acceptor [44]. This is in agreement with our previous results that light excited the pigment chlorophyllin, which in its excited singlet-state easily transferred electrons to oxygen to generate O2 −. Taking electrons from the reducing agent ascorbic acid, the oxidized pigment was reduced to the ground-state, which can then be used in a new excitation cycle. We observed that there was rarely production of H2O2 in the light-driven system (data are not shown). Although previous studies have shown that H2O2 was mainly produced by the disproportionation of O2 −, not all O2 − have undergone disproportionation to generate H2O2 [44,45]. Recent studies demonstrated that, to date, a large portion of photoproduced O2 − has been consumed by uncertain oxidative reactions other than disproportionation [46,47]. Thus, in our experiments, we inferred that O2 − was the dominant reactive species involved in the oxidation system rather than generating H2O2 via disproportionation. For the sake of further validating the reactive species O2 −, controlled experiments were carried out with varying SOD concentrations under light irradiation. SOD was able to efficiently convert O2 − to O2 and H2O2 in equal stoichiometric amounts. If O2 − played a crucial role in the reaction mechanism in the light-driven system, the addition of SOD was expected to inhibit the VA oxidation ability. Accordingly, in Fig. 6B, there was a distinct decrement in the VA oxidation when SOD was added. The results provided evidence in support of O2 − being responsible for the VA oxidation in the light-driven system. 3.3.3 The proposed mechanism of light-driven VA conversion The above results illustrated that in the light-driven chlorophyllin system, the improved selective conversion of VA can be ascribed to the higher O2 − formation, accompanied with the lower formation of OH. Studies also showed that the superoxide radicals formed in the carboxylate buffer system partly participated in the degradation of the high redox potential of lignin compounds [48]. On the other hand, since the standard redox potential is from O2 to O2 − is −0.33 eV (versus. Normal Hydrogen Electrode), the reduction reaction of triplet chlorophyllin occurred, and photogenerated electrons were allowed to transfer into molecular oxygen to generate the superoxide radicals (O2 −). Then the oxidized chlorophyllin acted as oxidizing agent to oxidize VA to VA cation radicals, regenerating the ground state of the molecule chlorophyllin. The generated superoxide radicals reacted with VA radicals to produce veratraldehyde. We investigated the selective conversion of the lignin model veratryl alcohol to veratraldehyde via photochemical pathways and clarified the underlying mechanisms involving reactive oxygen species by photo-generated under the irradiation of photosynthetic pigments. We proved the reusability of photosynthetic pigments during light-driven reaction processes. The approach of the direct application of photosynthetic pigments light-generated ROS to selective conversion of lignin model compound contributes to the development of potential industrial methods of aromatics production. Compared with metal catalysts and enzymes [5–8], photosynthesis pigment chlorophyllin has a wide range of sources and are simple to prepare. In addition, the photochemical conversion approach is insensitivity to temperature, which ensures the stability of VA conversion performance. These advantages allow this approach to demonstrate potential good commercial application prospects in the field of lignin and lignin model compounds conversion for the production of valuable chemicals."
8,Conclusion,"A light-driven system consisting of chlorophyllin and veratryl alcohol, and ascorbic acid as reductant for reducing oxidised pigments, was developed to determine the role of reactive oxygen species photochemically produced from pigments in the conversion of veratryl alcohol, a non-phenolic LMC. Results indicated that light with a wavelength of 310–420 nm was able to efficiently induce chlorophyllin to the excited state, which resulted in the highly selected conversion of veratryl alcohol to veratraldehyde (76% in 4 h). Further test experiments revealed the mechanism whereby chlorophyllin was light-excited to triplet state, inducing the occurrence of the reduction reaction of triplet chlorophyllin, and photogenerated electrons were transferred into molecular oxygen to generate O2 −. The oxidized chlorophyllin oxidized VA to VA cation radicals, regenerating the ground state of chlorophyllin molecules. The generated superoxide radicals react with VA radicals to produce veratraldehyde. Our results help us to understand the role of reactive oxygen species and excited photosynthetic pigment chlorophyllin in the photochemical conversion of lignin model compounds and contribute to the applications of chemical processing in lignin utilization and the production of valuable chemicals."
