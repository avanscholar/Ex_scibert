0,Introduction,"Conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to liquid fuels and value-added chemicals has been considered one of most promising approaches for the development of sustainable and economically viable biorefineries, which can address current global warming issues caused by exploration of petroleum-based fuels and chemicals [1,2]. Hemicellulose, which is one of the major constituents of lignocellulosic biomass (25–35 wt%), is a C5 anhydroxylan-based oligosaccharide that that can form hydrogen and covalent bonds with cellulose and lignin, respectively. Xylose and furfural (FFA) are considered important platform chemicals for producing a variety of liquid fuels and value-added chemicals. Xylose can be produced via hemicellulose (or xylan) hydrolysis, and xylose degradation can produce FFA [3,4]. Considering the environmental and economic benefits of using xylose as a precursor in the biorefinery industry, a strategy for its direct conversion to target products, which can eliminate highly energy-intensive and costly separation and purification steps after each intermediate production step, is highly desirable for producing valuable C5-based chemicals, such as furfuryl alcohol (FOL) and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFOL). The schematic diagram of xylose conversion is presented in Fig. 1 A. THFOL, which is an eco-friendly industrial solvent owing to its high water miscibility and biodegradability, can be used to fabricate printing inks and electronic cleaners and for agricultural applications [4,5]. In addition, THFOL can be used as a building block for the synthesis of 1,5-pentanediol [6–8], which is a monomer utilized to synthesize polyester and polyurethanes, and dihydropyran, which is used as a protecting group for alcohols. THFOL is typically produced via selective furan ring (–C=C–) hydrogenation of FOL over metal-based catalysts, such as Ru [9], Pd [10,11], Pt [12], and Ni [13–15]. Some of the previous studies on the conversion of FOL to THFOL are summarized in Table S1. To date, CuCr2O4 has been predominantly used in industrial settings as catalyst for the gas- and liquid-phase hydrogenation of FFA to FOL with FOL selectivities of 35–98% and 98%, respectively.[16] However, this reaction presented several drawbacks, such as inherent hazardous environmental risk, high toxicity of the Cr-based catalyst, and deactivation susceptibility [17,18], which can hinder the use of FOL as a THFOL precursor. In addition, the inevitable separation and purification of FOL after FFA hydrogenation, which are typically highly energy-intensive and time-consuming processes, hinder the overall FFA-to-THFOL conversion and increase production cost. Therefore, it is highly desirable to directly convert FFA to THFOL [17,19–45], or even produce THFOL directly from xylose [46,47], which can eliminate tedious separation and purification of reaction intermediates. Numerous studies have investigated the one-step FFA conversion to THFOL via the hydrogenation of the aldehyde (>C = O) group and –C = C– bond in the furan ring over different noble and base-metal catalysts, including Pd [19,21,22,24–28,30,36,39], Ru [23,25], Pt [24,29,34], Rh [45], and Ni [17,20,26,31–33,35,37,38,40–44] dispersed on several types of supports, such as metal oxides, carbons, and zeolites (Table S1). For example, almost complete high-selectivity conversion of FFA to THFOL was achieved over Ni/MMO-CO3 [20], 1.7Ru/ZrO2 + 1.1Pd/Al2O3 [25], and Ni/N-AC [43]. However, only a few researchers have investigated the direct conversion of xylose to THFOL, although the conversion of xylose to FOL over Brønsted acid–metal catalysts for subsequent dehydration and hydrogenation reactions has been studied [48–50]. The direct conversion of xylose to THFOL has been investigated in a biphasic water + cyclohexane reactor equipped with two-level rotating catalyst foams, which consisted of Amberlyst-15 [46] or zeolite-mordenite [47] for the dehydration of xylose in water and Ru/C for the hydrogenation of FFA to THFOL in cyclohexane. Even though pioneering studies have demonstrated that xylose can be directly converted to THFOL, a relatively low xylose conversion (62–67%), a low THFOL yield (23–28%), and side products, such as xylitol, levulinic acid, and 2-methylfuran (2-MF) have been reported. The direct cascade conversion of xylose to THFOL as a target product is still challenging owing to the following problems: (1) the highly reactive FFA and FOL intermediates tends to form humin and coke over highly acidic catalysts, resulting in low target product selectivity and catalyst deactivation and (2) the factors that govern tandem catalytic performance, such as multifunctional active sites and promoters and synthesis methods to control the number of active sites, have yet to be explored. Herein, we report a multifunctional Hβ-supported RuO2–Ru (RuO2–Ru/Hβ) catalyst for the one-pot high-yield direct conversion of xylose to THFOL in the absence of a biphasic solvent system (Fig. 1B). To control the active sites that favor the cascade tandem reaction, three catalyst synthesis methods, namely incipient wetness impregnation (IM), activated reductive deposition (ARD), and passivated ARD, were explored. The RuO2–Ru/Hβ catalyst prepared via passivated ARD contained RuO2 nanopatches in the corners and at the edges of metallic Ru nanoparticles (NPs). The Ru–RuO2 interfacial sites played a major role in the high-yield (61.8%) selective and cascade conversion of xylose to THFOL and suppressed the formation of humin and coke. In the following sections, the catalyst synthesis method, catalyst characterization, conversion of several types of feedstocks, namely C5- and C6-sugars, reaction intermediates, sucrose, and xylan, and in situ operando spectroscopy analysis of the FFA conversion are presented to highlight the beneficial features of the passivated RuOx–Ru/Hβ catalyst."

3,Catalyst synthesis,"2.2 Catalyst synthesis 2.2.1 Activation of zeolite support material NH4-zeolite β, NH4-zeolite Y, and NH4-ZSM5 zeolite were activated under an air flow of 100 mL min−1 at 450 °C for 3 h (ramping rate of 1.75 °C min−1). The activated zeolites are denoted as Hβ(x), HY(x), and HZSM5(x), where x is the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio. 2.2.2 Synthesis of Ru/Hβ via ARD For a typical synthesis of the Ru/Hβ catalyst with a Ru loading of 3.0 wt%, 64 mg of RuCl3·xH2O was dissolved in 20 mL of methanol at 23 ± 2 °C. Thereafter, 0.97 g of Hβ(x) was dispersed in 20 mL of methanol in a closed vial under ultrasonication for 10 min. Subsequently, the RuCl3 solution was added to the Hβ–methanol dispersion and the mixture was sonicated for 1 h. Next, 0.5–1.0 mL of a 0.5 M solution of hydrazine in methanol was added dropwise to the RuCl3–Hβ mixture under vigorous stirring until the pH reached approximately 7. The addition of hydrazine, caused the color of the mixture to change from brownish to grayish owing to the chemical reduction of Ru3+ ions to Ru°. The mixture was maintained at 23 ± 2 °C under stirring for 6 h to reduce Ru3+ ions and subsequently deposit Ru NPs on the surface of Hβ zeolite, which was confirmed by visually inspecting the transparent liquid phase formed in the reaction mixture. Next, the solid precipitate was vacuum filtered (Fig. S1), followed by washing several times with a DDI water–methanol mixture to remove Cl− ions, and the washed catalyst was dried at 100 °C overnight. The synthesized catalyst is denoted as Ru/Hβ-RD. The as-synthesized grayish Ru/Hβ-RD catalyst was calcined in air at a flow rate of 100 mL min−1 at 300 °C (ramping rate of 2.6 °C min−1) and subsequently activated under a H2/Ar flow of 100 mL min−1 at 450 °C for 5 h. The thermally activated Ru catalyst is denoted as yRu/Hβ-ARD, where y = 1, 3, 5 is the Ru loading (1, 3, and 5 wt%). In addition, HZSM5 and HY zeolite frameworks were used as catalyst supports, and the synthesized catalysts are denoted as yRu/HZSM5-ARD and yRu/HY-ARD, respectively. The Ru/Hβ-ARD catalyst was subsequently subjected to surface passivation to investigate the role of RuO2 in RuOx–Ru/Hβ-ARD during the conversion of xylose to THFOL. To synthesize RuO2–Ru/Hβ-ARD catalysts, fresh yRu/Hβ-ARD catalyst samples were cooled to 50 °C under an Ar flow of 100 mL min−1. Subsequently, the sweep gas was switched to pure O2 with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1. Thereafter, the temperature was increased to 200 °C (ramping rate of 1.7 °C min−1), and the catalyst was oxidized for 5–25 min. After surface passivation, the calcination tube was purged with Ar gas to remove residual O2 followed by cooling to 23 ± 2 °C. The surface-passivated Ru/Hβ-ARD catalyst is denoted as Ru@Hβ-ARD-zO, where z is the surface passivation time (z = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25). For comparison, Ru/Hβ with a Ru loading of 3 wt% was prepared using the conventional IM method. For a typical synthesis, 6.4 mL of a 0.048 M RuCl3 solution in methanol was added dropwise to 10 mL of methanol that contained 0.97 g of dispersed Hβ under vigorous stirring, and then the entire mixture was maintained at 23 ± 2 °C for 8 h under stirring. The impregnated sample was subsequently filtered (Fig. S1) and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight. Thereafter, the dried catalyst was calcined under an air flow of 100 mL min−1 at 300 °C (ramping rate of 2.6 °C min−1) and was subsequently reduced in a 5% H2/Ar flow of 100 mL min−1 at 450 °C for 5 h. The synthesized catalyst is denoted as Ru/Hβ-IM. For catalyst screening, Ru/SiO2 with a Ru loading of 3 wt% was prepared using the impregnation method and fumed silica as the support."

5,Results and discussion,
6,Formation of Ru active sites of the Ru/Hβ catalysts,"3.1 Formation of Ru active sites of the Ru/Hβ catalysts The physicochemical and electronic properties of the Ru NPs of the prepared catalysts depended on the synthesis method. The catalyst synthesis methods and synthesis–property correlation are schematically illustrated in Fig. S2. 3.1.1 IM method Because of its simplicity, the IM method has been widely used to prepare noble metal- and transition metal-based supported catalysts. Prior to impregnation, homogeneous Ru salt solutions were prepared by dissolving RuCl3 in methanol. Solid RuCl3 was dissociated into Ru3+ cations and Cl– anions, which were stabilized by methanol in solution. The pH of the 3 wt% RuCl3 solution was 1.96. During impregnation, the RuCl3 methanol solution was added to a methanol dispersion of Hβ(25) zeolite support, and Ru3+ cations were allowed to interact with the counterions in the aluminosilicate framework of Hβ(25) zeolite via electrostatic interactions. The initial PZC of the Hβ(25) zeolite support, which was estimated by determining the equilibrium pH of the acid–base titration, was 4.11 (Fig. S3, Table S2). After the RuCl3 methanol solution was added to the Hβ(25) zeolite dispersion in methanol, the PZC of the Hβ(25) zeolite support decreased significantly to 2.93 because of the highly acidic nature of the RuCl3 methanol solution. Because the pH of the solution was lower than the PZC of Hβ zeolite, the Hβ zeolite surface was protonated and polarized with positive charges (+OH2) [51]. Therefore, the strong electrostatic interactions between the Hβ(25) zeolite support and Cl− anions prevented the desirable interactions between Ru3+ cations and the aluminosilicate framework of Hβ(25) zeolite. Thereafter, the mixture was oven-dried to obtain RuCl3 + Hβ(25) (dry). The PZC of RuCl3 + Hβ(25) (dry) was 4.00, which was slightly lower than that of pristine Hβ zeolite, indicating that RuCl3 + Hβ(25) (dry) exhibited slightly higher Brønsted acid character and a more positively charged surface than pristine Hβ(25) zeolite. Subsequently, RuCl3 + Hβ(25) (dry) was calcined in air and reduced in a H2/Ar atmosphere to produce Ru/Hβ(25)-IM. The PZC of Ru/Hβ(25)-IM (4.60) was significantly higher than that of RuCl3 + Hβ(25) (dry). This indicated that the surface of Ru/Hβ(25)-IM was highly polarized, which was attributed to the presence of Cl− anions on the catalyst surface. Therefore, both Ru metal and Cl− anions were present on the Hβ zeolite support of the Ru/Hβ(25)-IM catalyst, and these species can significantly affect the hydrogenation activity of Ru metal because the highly negatively charged surface can repel reactants (or intermediates). 3.1.2 RD and ARD methods To resolve the problem of residual Cl− anions on the catalyst surface, the hydrazine-induced RD method was used. Inspired by previously developed strategies for selective metal deposition on acidic supports via strong electrostatic interactions [52–54], the RD and ARD methods were used to selectively deposit and reduce Ru3+ cations on Hβ zeolite supports by suppressing the repulsions between Cl− anions and the negatively charged Hβ zeolite surface. In this study, hydrazine was used as a Lewis base and reducing agent for the deposition of Ru NPs instead of other of strong bases, such as NaOH and KOH, which can dissolve the aluminosilicate framework of the Hβ zeolite support [55]. The hydrazine reduction method has been reported previously to decrease the Cl− anion residue content on catalyst surfaces when Cl-based metal salt precursors, such as RuCl3 were used [56]. The addition of hydrazine to the acidic RuCl3 solution resulted in the formation of a Ru2+/Ru3+–amine complex cation ([Ru(NH3)5N2)]2+) [57]. The controlled deposition of the [Ru(NH3)5N2)]2+ complex cations on the support and subsequent formation of metallic Ru phase could suppress the rapid nucleation and growth of Ru NPs [58,59], resulting in the formation of ultrasmall and well-dispersed Ru NPs in the Ru/Hβ(25)-RD catalyst. After hydrazine was added to the RuCl3–Hβ(25)–methanol mixture, the pH of the mixture increased to 8.00–9.00, which was much higher than the PZC of Hβ zeolite (4.11). Therefore, the surface of Hβ zeolite was negatively charged owing to the formation of aluminol groups on the surface of the aluminosilicate framework [60]. Upon hydrazine addition, the color of the mixture gradually changed from reddish brown to greenish yellow and lastly to dark gray, indicating the formation of [Ru(NH3)5N2)]2+ complex cations in the solution phase [57]. The formed [Ru(NH3)5N2)]2+ complex cations were subsequently adsorbed on the negatively charged Hβ(25) zeolite surface via strong electrostatic interactions, and the electrostatic repulsions between Cl− anions and the negatively charged Hβ(25) zeolite surface was suppressed. Consequently, the excess Cl− anions in the solution phase can be separated from the Ru/Hβ(25) surface via centrifugation without a significant loss of Ru precursor, and a Cl−-free Ru/Hβ(25) catalyst was prepared. The PZC of the dry Ru/Hβ(25)-RD catalyst (5.65) was higher than those of pristine Hβ(25) zeolite (4.11) and the Ru/Hβ(25)-IM catalyst (4.60). This indicated the basic nature of the catalyst, which was attributed to the aluminol groups and [Ru(NH3)5N2)]2+ complex cations. To completely transform the [Ru(NH3)5N2)]2+ complex cations to metallic Ru NPs and remove the amine residue, the Ru/Hβ(25)-RD catalyst was calcined in air and subsequently in H2 to produce a N-and-Cl−-free Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst. The PZC of the N-and-Cl−-free Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst (4.20) was lower than those of the Ru/Hβ(25)-RD (5.65) and Ru/Hβ(25)-IM (4.60) catalysts but slightly higher than that of pristine Hβ zeolite (4.11). The negligible difference in the PZC values of the Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst and Hβ zeolite support could be caused by the electronegativity of metallic Ru NPs. The N-and-Cl−-free Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst with well-defined metal–acid sites could activate the cascade conversion of xylose through sequential dehydration and hydrogenation reactions, as discussed in the following sections. 3.1.3 Catalyst characterization The phase structures of the Hβ(25) zeolite support and Ru-supported catalysts (3Ru/Hβ(25)-IM, 3Ru/Hβ(25)-RD, and 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD) were examined using XRD, and the results are presented in Fig. 2 A. The diffraction peaks at 2θ of 38.4°, 42.2°, and 44° in the XRD pattern of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-IM catalyst correspond to the (100), (002), and (101) planes, respectively, of metallic Ru° phase (JCPDS # 06-0663). In contrast, no characteristic Ru° peaks were observed in the XRD pattern of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-RD catalyst, which could be attributed to the incomplete conversion of the [Ru(NH3)5N2)]2+ complex cation to the metallic Ru° phase or the extremely small size of Ru° NPs (approximately 1–2 nm), which was below the XRD detection limit [61]. The characteristic peaks of the metallic Ru° phase were observed in the XRD pattern of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst, indicating that Ru3+ cations were completely reduced and Ru NPs grew during heat treatment. The crystallite size of Ru° NPs in the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst (12.7 nm), which was measured using the Ru (101) peak and the Scherrer equation, was smaller than that of the Ru° NPs in the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-IM catalyst (16.6 nm), suggesting that the ARD method suppressed crystal growth to some extent. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and textural properties of the catalysts are presented in Fig. 2B and Table 1 , respectively. Pristine Hβ(25) zeolite exhibited a type III isotherm (IUPAC) with an H1 hysteresis loop, indicating the presence of both micro- and mesopores in its structure. The Ru loading did not significantly affect the textural properties of the Hβ(25) zeolite support. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and pore volume of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-RD catalyst were much lower than those of the bare Hβ(25) zeolite support (Table 1); ultrasmall Ru NPs and the [Ru(NH3)5N2)]2+ complex cations, which were uniformly distributed throughout the framework, could block some of the pores, resulting in a decrease in the surface area and pore volume of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-RD catalyst. The BET surface area and pore volume of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-IM and 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalysts were larger than those of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-RD catalyst, indicating that large Ru NPs were mostly located at the external surface of the support. The electronic states of Ru in the catalysts were investigated using XPS, and the results are presented in Figs. 2C–F. The high-resolution XPS profiles were referenced to the main C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. The main peaks at 461.7 and 463.5 eV in the deconvoluted Ru 3p3/2 XPS profile (Fig. 2D) corresponded to Ru° and Ru4+, respectively, and the peak at 465.3 eV was a satellite peak [62,63]. The Ru4+/Ru° ratios of the catalysts were calculated using the area% of the Ru° and Ru4+ peaks. The Ru4+/Ru° ratio of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-RD catalyst (2.40) was much higher than those of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD (0.09) and 3Ru/Hβ-IM (0.11) catalysts, indicating that the [Ru(NH3)5N2)]2+ complex cation was not completely reduced to metallic Ru° during the hydrazine reduction reaction. The relative amount of Ru4+ in the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-IM catalyst was slightly higher than that in the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst, which was attributed to the incomplete reduction of RuO2 to metallic Ru in the presence of the residual Cl− anions on the catalyst surface [64]. The peak at 198.1 eV in the XPS profile of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-IM catalyst (Fig. S4A) indicated the presence of Cl− anions on the surface of the 3Ru/Hβ-IM catalyst. The Ru 3d3/2 and Ru 3d5/2 XPS profiles of the catalysts are presented in Fig. 2E and F, respectively. The peak at 282.2 eV in the Ru 3d3/2 XPS profiles of the catalysts further confirmed the presence of Ru4+ [65]. The peak at 279.9 eV in the Ru 3d5/2 XPS profiles of the catalysts was attributed to the metallic Ru° phase. The additional peak at a high binding energy of 280.7 eV observed in the Ru 3d5/2 XPS profile of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-RD catalyst was ascribed to the presence of the [Ru(NH3)5N2)]2+ complex cations [66]. The subpeaks at 397.1, 400.0, and 402.0 eV in the N 1s XPS profile of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-RD catalyst (Fig. S4B) were attributed to metal nitrides or nitrogen adsorbed on the surface of Ru/RuOx, nitrogen atoms of oxynitrides, and nitrogen atoms in metal oxides, respectively [67]. Therefore, Ru–O and Ru–N bonds were present in the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-RD catalyst. The different oxidation states of Ru in each catalyst suggested that the catalyst synthesis method strongly affected the electronic state of Ru in catalysts, which in turn affected catalytic performance. In the 3Ru/Hβ-ARD catalyst, the peaks associated with Cl and N were not observed in the XPS spectra (Fig. S5), indicating that the absence Cl and N species in the catalyst. The local chemical environments of Ru in each catalyst were further analyzed using XAS. The Ru K-edge XANES spectra of the catalysts (Fig. 2G) indicated that the valence of Ru in the catalysts ranged between 0 and +4. A close inspection of the XANES profiles revealed that the adsorption edges of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD and 3Ru/Hβ(25)-IM catalysts upshifted slightly compared with that of Ru foil, suggesting that the Ru species in the catalysts were slightly oxidized [68]. The adsorption edge of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-RD catalyst was close to that of the RuO2 standard, indicating that RuO2 was a major constituent of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-RD catalyst. The Fourier-transformed k 3-weighted EXAFS profiles of the Ru K3-edge of the catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 2H. The EXAFS data were fitted to determine the coordination numbers (CNs) of Ru in the catalysts (the fitting quality is listed in Table S3). The small peaks at a radial distance of 1.6 Å in the EXAFS profiles of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-IM and 3Ru/Hβ-ARD catalysts corresponded to the Ru–O bonds [68]. The CNs of Ru–O in the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-IM and 3Ru/Hβ-ARD catalysts were 0.63 and 1.24, respectively. The intense peak at 2.4 Å in the EXAFS profiles of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-IM and 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalysts indicated that the metallic Ru species were predominant. The intensity of the Ru–Ru peak in the EXAFS profile of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst was lower than that in the EXAFS profile of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-IM catalyst, indicating the presence of unsaturated Ru–Ru coordination sites or the presence of defects on the surface of metallic Ru NPs in the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst. The CNs of Ru in the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-IM and 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalysts were 11.68 and 10.97, respectively, which were slightly lower than that of bulk Ru (12). In contrast, a broad and weak peak was present in the EXAFS profile of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-RD catalyst, which was associated with Ru–Ru scattering. In addition, the broad and relatively intense peak at 1.6 Å in the EXAFS profile of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-RD catalyst indicated the presence of a mixture of Ru oxide and Ru oxynitride. The CN of Ru–O in the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-RD catalyst was 5.95, which was much higher than those in the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-IM and 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalysts. A schematic for the size and morphology of the Ru NPs in the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-IM, 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD, and 3Ru/Hβ(25)-IM catalysts, which were estimated using the aforementioned data, and are presented in Fig. 2I. The morphologies of the catalysts were examined using SEM and HR-TEM and the images are illustrated in Fig. 3 . The Hβ(25) zeolite support consisted of randomly arranged, highly aggregated, and nonuniform shaped particles (Fig. S6). The morphology of the Hβ(25) zeolite support did not change significantly after Ru loading (Fig. 3A–C). The Ru NPs (mean size of 1.38 ± 0.27 nm) were well dispersed on the Hβ(25) zeolite support of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-RD catalyst. After heat treatment, the mean size of the Ru NPs of the synthesized 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst increased because of particle agglomeration. The Ru NPs of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-IM catalyst presented the largest size of 17.5 ± 2.11 nm of all 3Ru/Hβ(25) catalysts. The d-spacing of 0.201 nm of the Ru NPs in the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-IM and 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalysts corresponded to the Ru(101) plane. The EDS elemental maps of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst (Fig.s 3G–J) indicated the uniform distribution of Ru NPs on the Hβ(25) zeolite support. The H2-TPR profiles of the catalysts (Fig. 4 A) were collected to investigate catalyst reducibility. Prior to H2-TPR testing, each catalyst was reoxidized at 200 °C for 1 h under a pure O2 flow. No reduction peaks were observed in the H2-TPR profile of the bare Hβ(25) zeolite support because of the strong aluminosilicate framework in the zeolite structure. The H2-TPR profiles of the catalysts were divided into three reduction regions: <150, 150–300, and >300 °C. The multiple H2 consumption peaks in the H2-TPR profiles indicated the presence of several valence states of Ru and a strong metal–support interaction (SMSI) effect. The low-temperature region (<150 °C) was attributed to the reduction of small RuO2 NPs to metallic Ru NPs, the peak in the medium temperature range of 150–300 °C was ascribed to the reduction of large RuO2 NPs, and the high-temperature peak above 300 °C was assigned to the SMSI effect [69]. The strong peak at 85 °C and broad peak at 306 °C in the H2-TPR profile of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-RD catalyst indicated the presence of ultrasmall Ru NPs and some Ru species, which interacted strongly with the support, respectively. The reduction temperatures of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst were lower than those of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-IM catalyst, suggesting that the Ru NPs in the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst were smaller than those in the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-IM catalyst. This agreed well with the Ru dispersion data determined using CO chemisorption (Table 1); the dispersion of Ru in the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst was higher than that in the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-IM catalyst. The low dispersion of Ru in the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-RD catalyst was attributed to the blockage of Ru sites by Cl− anions inhibiting the adsorption of CO [56]. The H2-TPD profiles of the as-synthesized Ru catalysts are presented in Fig. 4B, and the total amount of desorbed H2 of each catalyst is listed in Table S4. The low-temperature desorption region (50–200 °C) was attributed to the chemisorbed H2 on the Ru metal surface; conversely, the medium- and high-temperature desorption regions (200–400 °C and 400–600 °C, respectively) originated from the strongly chemisorbed or subsurface H2 and the formation of metal hydrides, respectively [70]. The dominant low-temperature region in the H2-TPD profiles of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-IM and 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalysts (approximately 40%) indicated that relatively weak H2 chemisorption occurred, whereas the dominant high-temperature desorption region observed in the H2-TPD profile of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-RD catalyst indicated that most of the H2 molecules were strongly chemisorbed on the surface of Ru NPs. The residual Cl− anions at the Ru sites in the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-IM catalyst caused the total amount of desorbed H2 (0.018 mmol g−1) to be slightly lower than that of the Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst (0.021 mmol g−1) [70]. The NH3-TPD profiles and acidity values of the Hβ(25) zeolite support and 3Ru/Hβ(25) catalysts are presented in Fig. 4C and Table S5, respectively. The profiles of the Hβ(25) zeolite support and as-synthesized catalysts were divided into three main areas, namely weak (<200 °C), medium (200–450 °C) and strong (>450 °C) acidity. The low acidity peak was attributed to the desorption of weakly adsorbed NH3 on weak Lewis acid sites (e.g., cation-bonded silanol groups) and Brønsted acid sites (e.g., terminal silanol group), the medium acidity peak was associated with the interaction of NH3 with strong Brønsted acid sites (e.g., acidic proton at the bridging Si–(OH)–Al sites), and the strong acidity peak was assigned to the interactions of NH3 with strong Lewis acid sites (extra Al framework of the Si–(O)–Al sites) and strong Brønsted acid sites [71,72]. The Hβ(25) zeolite support presented mostly weak acid sites (0.42 mmol g−1) followed by medium and strong acid sites (1.09 and 0.09 mmol g−1, respectively) and the total acidity was 1.60 mmol g−1 (Table S5). The total acidities of the 3Ru/Hβ(25) catalysts (1.32–1.47 mmol g−1) were lower than that of the Hβ(25) zeolite support. The concentration of strong acid sites of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-RD catalyst (0.04 mmol g−1) was lower than that of all other catalysts, suggesting that the preferential adsorption of the [Ru(NH3)5N2)]2+ complex cations at the strong acid sites suppressed NH3 adsorption (Fig. S2). The concentration of strong acid sites of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst (0.65 mmol g−1) was significantly higher than that of the Hβ(25) zeolite support, indicating that oxidation followed by reduction activated the acid sites of the Hβ(25) zeolite support."
7,Catalyst screening,"3.2 Catalyst screening Prior to examining the direct conversion of xylose to THFOL over zeolite-supported Ru-based catalysts, Hβ(25), HZSM5(50), and HY(30) zeolites were tested for the conversion of xylose at 180 °C and an initial N2 pressure of 3.0 MPa for 1 h in THF to investigate the potential role of the support in the conversion of xylose, and the results are listed in Table 2 . For the reaction in the absence of a catalyst or support, a very low xylose conversion of 23.3% and a low FFA yield of 2.8% were observed (entry 1, Table 2). When the Hβ(25) zeolite support was used, almost complete conversion of xylose (98.0%) and a high FFA yield (78.8%) were achieved (entry 4, Table 2, Fig. S7A); this FFA yield was much higher than those over the HZSM5(50) and HY(30) zeolites (43.5% (entry 2) and 53.0% (entry 3), respectively, Table 2). Therefore, the Hβ(25) zeolite support was very effective for the conversion of xylose to FFA through isomerization of xylose to xylulose and subsequent dehydration of xylulose to FFA (Fig. 1A), which could be due to spatial constraints in the Hβ(25) zeolite, leading to high furfural shape-selectivity (Fig. S8) [73]. To further convert FFA to THFOL, a hydrogenation step is required. Ru-based zeolite-supported catalysts were treated at 180 °C for 1 h under an initial H2 pressure of 3.0 MPa in THF. The FFA yield over the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-RD catalyst was only 34.0%, which was much lower than that reported for the Hβ(25) zeolite support, and a trace amount of THFOL (5.9%) was produced (entry 5, Table 2, Fig. S7B). These results indicated that the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-RD catalyst could not hydrogenate the FFA intermediate, which was attributed to the brokage of dissociation of H2 on the surface of Ru in the presence of Cl− anions (Fig. 4B) and incomplete formation of metallic Ru phase (Fig. 2). A much higher THFOL yield of 42.9% and complete consumption of FFA were achieved over the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst (entry 6, Table 2, Fig. S7C). This indicated that thermal activation combined with RD effectively promoted cascade dehydration and xylose hydrogenation. The FFA and THFOL yields over the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-IM catalyst (27.3% and 15.6%, respectively) were much higher and lower, respectively (entry 7, Table 2, Fig. S7D), than those reported over the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst. The low THFOL yield over the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-IM catalyst could be attributed to the size of the Ru NPs and Ru metal dispersion being larger and lower, respectively, than those of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst. To investigate the role of zeolite supports in xylose conversion, 5 wt% Ru/Al2O3 and 3 wt% Ru/SiO2 were used as catalysts. The xylose conversion and THFOL yield over the 5 wt% Ru/Al2O3 catalyst (entry 8, Table 2) were high (74.3%) and low (7.0%), respectively. The formation of THFOL over the Al2O3 support was feasible because of its Lewis acid sites, which can promote xylose isomerization to xylulose. At high temperatures and/or in the presence of moisture, xylulose dehydration occurred to produce FFA [74], which, subsequently, converted to THFOL on the Ru sites of the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst. When the 3 wt% Ru/SiO2 catalyst was used (entry 9, Table 2), xylose conversion was very low (15.3%) and THFOL did not form owing to the neutral nature of the SiO2 support. For the 5 wt% Ru/Al2O3 and 3 wt% Ru/SiO2 catalysts, the main reaction product was xylitol, which was the product of the direct hydrogenation of xylose (Fig. 1A). Therefore, the high THFOL yield over the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst indicated that strong acid sites can activate xylose dehydration to form FFA. To further examine the role of the Hβ(25) zeolite support on the cascade conversion of xylose, several types of Ru catalysts, namely 3Ru/HZSM5(80)-ARD, 3Ru/HY(30)-ARD, 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD, 3Ru/Hβ(38)-ARD, and 3Ru/Hβ(360)-ARD were tested, and the results are presented in Fig. S9A. The acid sites and pore sizes of zeolites played important roles in xylose conversion. The total yields of intermediates and products, including FFA, THFOL, 2-MTHF, and THP, over the 3Ru/HZSM5(80)-ARD catalyst were lower than those over the 3Ru/HY(30)-ARD and 3Ru/Hβ(30/38/360)-ARD catalysts. The channels of the HZSM5 zeolite with 10-membered rings (5.5 Å × 5.1 Å and 5.6 Å × 5.3 Å), which were smaller than those of the Hβ and HY zeolites (Fig. S8), were smaller than the sizes of xylose (6.5 Å), FFA (5.9 Å), and THFOL (6.6 Å) molecules. The channels of the Hβ and HY zeolites with 12-membered rings (6.6 Å × 7.1 Å and 7.4 × 7.4 Å, respectively) were larger than the sizes of xylose, FFA, and THFOL molecules. Because the pores of the HZSM5 zeolite were smaller than the size of the reactant molecules, the reaction mostly occurred at the external surface of the zeolite, resulting in a low xylose conversion and a low THFOL yield (Fig. S9B). The Si/Al ratios of the 3Ru/HY(30)-ARD and 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalysts were similar. However, the FFA (20.0 %) and THFOL (11.9 %) yields of the xylose conversion over 3Ru/HY(30)-ARD were much higher and lower, respectively, than those over the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst (0 % and 41.8 %, respectively). The presence of unconverted FFA intermediate and the production of levulinic acid (LA) and γ-valerolactone (GVL) were observed over the 3Ru/HY(30)-ARD catalyst (Fig. S9C). Proton transfer from the Brønsted acid sites to FOL and subsequent hydration could produce LA [75], whereas intermolecular LA cyclization and subsequent dehydration over the acid sites could produce GVL [76]. LA and GVL were produced over the 3Ru/HY(30)-ARD catalyst; however, they were not produced over the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst. This implied the preferential interaction of FFA and FOL with the metallic sites of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst. The xylose conversion and THFOL yield decreased with increasing Si/Al ratio of the Hβ zeolite supports (Fig. S9A) owing to the decrease in acidity of the Hβ zeolite supports with increasing Si/Al ratio (Table S5). Therefore, the effective conversion of xylose to THFOL over the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst suggested that the Hβ(25) zeolite presented optimum channel sizes, which can accommodate xylose, FFA, and THFOL molecules, and optimum acidity to favor the isomerization and subsequent dehydration of xylose [77]."
8,Solvent effect,"3.3 Solvent effect During biomass conversion, solvents play a critical role in determining the reaction pathways that lead to the desired products [78–81]. Several solvents, such as water, GVL, dioxane, and THF, have been analyzed to determine the favorable reaction medium for xylose conversion [78,82]. In this study, several solvents, namely water (a highly polar protic solvent), methanol, ethanol, and IPA (medium polar protic solvents), hexane (a nonpolar solvent), and THF (a moderate polar aprotic solvent), were used for the conversion of xylose over the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst at 180 °C and an initial H2 pressure of 3.0 MPa for 1 h, and the results were compared. Polar protic solvents were not suitable for the selective conversion of xylose to THFOL (Fig. S10). When water was used as the solvent, the major products were xylitol and 2-pentanol, and THFOL was not observed. Ring opening of xylose to acyclic xylose and subsequent hydrogenation of the carbonyl group in acyclic xylose produced xylitol in water [83]. Moreover, 2-pentanol could be produced via ring opening of FOL to 1,2-pentandiol [9] and subsequent hydrodeoxygenation of the terminal hydroxyl group of 1,2-pentandiol. Alcohols have been considered better solvents than water for the conversion of xylose to FFA because of their ability to stabilize reaction intermediates and suppress humin formation [78,84]. When alcohols were used as solvents, xylose dehydration over the acid sites of the catalysts was highly activated to produce mostly alkyl xylosides. The major products of xylose conversion in methanol were FOL, 2-(dimethoxymethyl)furan (DOF), and methyl xyloside. DOF can be produced via the acetalization of FFA with methanol [85]. When ethanol was used as the solvent, open-ring products (1,1-diethoxyethane and 1,4-diethoxybutane), ethyl xyloside, and a small fraction of THFOL were generated. When IPA was used as the solvent, the major products were FFA, GVL, and isopropyl xylose. The dominant production of FFA in IPA compared with the xylose conversion in methanol and ethanol can be attributed to the better leaving property of the isopropyl group in the alkyl xyloside [86]. FFA hydrogenation to isopropyl levulinate, which could be activated by the Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reduction of IPA over the Lewis acid sites of the Hβ(25) zeolite support and subsequent cyclization, could produce GVL when IPA was used as the solvent [87]. When nonpolar aprotic hexane was used as the solvent, because of the low solubility of xylose, a brownish solid was produced. However, the reaction followed the desired isomerization–dehydration–hydrogenation steps to produce THFOL. In addition, THP and 2-MF, which were produced via the hydrogenation of THFOL and hydrogenolysis of FOL, respectively, were observed in the product mixture. Therefore, unlike polar protic solvents, nonpolar solvents favored the desired reaction pathway during the one-pot conversion of xylose. Based on solvent screening tests, it was concluded that the use of THF, which is a moderate polar aprotic solvent, predominantly favored the cascade hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation of xylose to THFOL. During the early stage of the reaction, a polar aprotic solvent could stabilize the acidic protons generated from the Hβ zeolite support, which can accelerate the acid-catalyzed reaction [88,89]."
9,Process optimization,"3.4 Process optimization The effect of Ru loading of the Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalysts on xylose conversion and THFOL selectivity was analyzed (entries 10 and 11, Table 2). When 1Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD was used as the catalyst, both FFA and THFOL were major products, and their yields were 24.0% and 25.1%, respectively. The high yield of FFA intermediate in the reaction mixture over the 1Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst demonstrated the low ability of the catalyst to favor the selective hydrogenation of FFA, although the Ru dispersion of the 1Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst was approximately twice as high as that of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst (Table 1). For the 5Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst, almost complete conversion of xylose and FFA was achieved; however, the THFOL yield (31.9%) was lower than that over the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst (42.9%). The increase in Ru loading from 3 to 5 wt% resulted in increased 2-MTHF and THP yields owing to the subsequent hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation reactions (Fig. 1A). Reaction parameters, including temperature, initial H2 pressure, and time were varied to optimize the THFOL yield over the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst. Even at a low reaction temperature of 150 °C, a high xylose conversion of 84% was achieved; however, the THFOL yield was low (21.0%) and the unreacted FFA intermediate yield was high (11.2%) (Fig. S11A). The other products included 2-MTHF (1.92%), THP (0.27%), C5 reduced sugars (xylitol, arabitol, xylulose, 1,4-anhydroxylopyranose, and lyxose), cyclopentanone, cyclopentanol, 2-pentanol, and 2-methylfuran. At 170 °C, the xylose conversion increased to 90%, the THFOL yield increased significantly to 40.1%, and no residual FFA was present. The THFOL yield leveled off at approximately 42% at temperatures above 180 °C. The high-temperature-activated hydrogenolysis reaction of THFOL resulted in an increase in the 2-MTHF yield (Fig. S11D); furthermore, the conversion of THFOL to 2-MTHF was confirmed by reacting THFOL over the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst. At a low H2 pressure of 1.0 MPa, xylose conversion was incomplete (80%), the FFA yield was high (42.5%), and the THFOL yield was low (6.8%), indicating the incomplete conversion of FFA to THFOL (Fig. S11B). At 2.0 MPa H2, the xylose conversion increased to 84%, and the effective hydrogenation of FFA to THFOL led to a high THFOL yield of 38.2%. In addition, 2-MTHF and THP byproducts were formed. When the initial H2 pressure was increased to 3.0 MPa, the THFOL yield further increased to 42.8%. A further increase in H2 pressure to 4.0 MPa resulted in a lower THFOL yield of 38.8%, which was attributed to the increase in the amount of generated THP. This revealed that high initial H2 pressure favored ring opening and subsequent cyclization over the acidic sites of the Hβ zeolite support (Fig. S11E). At low feed-to-catalyst ratios, the yields of 2-MTHF and THP byproducts were higher than at high feed-to-catalyst ratios. This was attributed to the increased contact with the acid sites on the Hβ zeolite support and metal sites of the catalysts (Fig. S11C), resulting in high yields of THP and 2-MTHF byproducts."
10,Active sites of the Ru/Hβ catalysts,"3.5 Active sites of the Ru/Hβ catalysts The catalyst synthesis method significantly affected the physicochemical properties of the Ru/Hβ catalysts, which, in turn, determined the rection pathways. When the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst was used, the selective cascade conversion of xylose to THFOL was achieved; moreover, further hydrogenolysis to form 2-MTHF and ring opening and subsequent cyclization to form THP were suppressed. The size, morphology, and electronic state of Ru metal depended on the catalyst synthesis method and led to different atomic arrangements and electronic effects. To investigate the surface arrangement of Ru NPs in the catalysts, the CO-DRIFTS profiles of the catalysts were obtained at different temperatures in the range of 30–180 °C. At 30 °C, the major absorption bands at 2171 and 2117 cm−1 were attributed to gaseous CO (Fig. 5 ) [90]. Gaseous CO was detected even after N2 flushing for 30 min. As the temperature of the DRIFT cell was increased to 60 °C, the intensity of the gaseous CO absorption band decreased significantly, whereas the bands associated with the adsorbed CO on the surface of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst emerged in the wavenumber range of 1800–2000 cm−1. As the temperature was further increased above 150 °C, the intensities of the bands associated with the adsorbed CO species decreased. The characteristic peaks of CO adsorbed on metallic surfaces are categorized according to their adsorption geometries. The peaks at 2130 and 2081 cm−1 in the CO-DRIFTS profile of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst were attributed to the tricarbonyl species adsorbed on the partially oxidized [Run+–(CO)3] species [91]. The adsorption bands in the wavenumber range of 2064–2069 cm−1 were assigned to linearly adsorbed CO on the low-coordinated Ru surface atoms (edges/corner sites) of Ru NPs, and the bands in the wavenumber range of 2035–2036 cm−1 corresponded to linearly adsorbed CO on the high-coordinated Ru surface atoms (terrace sites) of Ru NPs [92]. The band at 2069 cm−1 in the CO-DRIFTS profile of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst was more intense than those in the CO-DRIFTS profiles of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-RD and 3Ru/Hβ(25)-IM catalysts, indicating the high availability of the edge and corner sites on the surface of Ru NPs. The adsorption bands at 2005–2006 cm−1 corresponded to linearly adsorbed CO on isolated Ru° species surrounded by Run+ cations [93]. In the low wavenumber region below 2000 cm−1, the small humps at 1980 cm−1 and 1948–1955 cm−1 observed in the CO-DRIFTS profiles of 3Ru/Hβ(25)-RD and 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalysts were assigned to the CO bridged-bonded on the terrace and edge sites of the Ru NPs, respectively [94]. The small shoulder peak in the wavenumber range of 1854–1847 cm−1 in the CO-DRIFTS profile of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst could be assigned to multi-bonded CO (e.g., hollow or 3-fold sites) [95]. Therefore, the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst was enriched with low-coordinated Ru species on the surface of Ru NPs. Conversely, few low-coordinated Ru species were observed for the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-IM catalyst. The high availability of low-coordinated Ru species could be responsible for the formation of a RuO2 layer, which resulted in the enriched RuO2–Ru interface. As discussed in Section 3.9, the RuO2–Ru interface played an important role in the high-yield direct conversion of xylose to THFOL by suppressing humin formation."
11,Catalyst recyclability,"3.6 Catalyst recyclability After the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst was used for xylose conversion at 180 °C and an initial H2 pressure of 3.0 MPa for 1 h (first run), the color of the catalyst changed from gray to dark brown even after washing with acetone and water to remove the organic species that might have been present on its surface owing to the deposition of coke. After drying in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight, the spent catalyst was reused for xylose conversion without coke burning and activation, and the results are presented in Fig. 6 A. During the second run, the THFOL yield decreased significantly from 42.9% to 16.3%, the yield of unconverted FFA intermediate increased significantly from 0% to 46.3%, and xylose conversion decreased slightly from 92.4% to 90.9%. These results suggested that humin and coke formed during the first run did not significantly decrease the number of acid sites; however, most of the active sites of the Ru NPs were blocked by deposited coke. Metal leaching was not responsible for the decrease in the hydrogenation ability of the spent catalyst because the Ru content of the fresh and spent catalysts, which were measured using ICP-OES, were very similar (Table 1). To analyze coke formation, the TGA profiles of the spent catalyst after the first run without washing and after solvent washing were collected in air, and the results are illustrated in Fig. 6B. The weight losses of the unwashed and washed spent catalysts were 18.9 and 8.2 wt%, respectively. This indicated that water/acetone washing could remove some soluble organic species deposited on the spent catalyst surface; however, humin and coke that were not solubilized in the washing solvents remained on the surface of the spent catalyst. The formation of humin followed by coke has been reported during the conversion of biomass constituents in highly acidic media [96,97]. As shown in Fig. S12A, in case of the catalyst collected after the reaction at the low temperature of 150 °C, the weight loss was 3.4%, a value that was much smaller than that collected at the high temperature of 180 °C (Fig. 6B), indicating the low amount of humin and coke formation. To recover the activity of the spent catalyst, the coke deposited on the spent catalyst after the first run was burned out via calcination at 450 °C under an air flow for 2 h, followed by catalyst reduction at 450 °C for 4 h under a 5% H2/Ar flow. The THFOL yield over the regenerated catalyst (40.5%) was slightly lower than that over the fresh catalyst (42.8%) but 2.5 times higher than that over the spent catalyst after the first run without coke burning (16.3%) (Fig. 6A). Therefore, the removal of humin and coke deposited on the surface of the spent catalyst played a critical role in recovering catalyst activity. However, the coke burning–regeneration cycle of the spent catalyst could not completely recover the THFOL selectivity of the fresh catalyst. The air exposure durations of the fresh and regenerated catalysts were different, and the difference in native oxide formation could affect THFOL selectivity. To analyze the role of surface oxide of the Ru NPs, the catalyst recovered after the second run was subjected to a coke burning–regeneration cycle followed by passivation under an O2 flow at 200 °C for 2 min prior to reuse for xylose conversion. The THFOL yield over the passivated catalyst increased to 43.0% (Fig. 6A), which indicated the critical role of RuO2 at the surface of Ru NPs on the conversion of xylose to THFOL. This prompted us to further examine the role of the RuO2–Ru interface as an active site for the conversion of xylose and FFA and FOL intermediates by adjusting the formation of RuO2, as described in Section 3.9. The diagrams of the activity loss of the spent catalyst and surface passivation are presented in Fig. 6C."
12,Passivation of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst,"3.7 Passivation of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst To elucidate the role of active sites of Ru-based catalysts in the direct conversion of xylose to THFOL, the activated 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst was subjected to H2-TPR analysis with and without an in situ pre-oxidation step in the TPR chamber. The H2-TPR profile of the fresh 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst included low-temperature reduction peaks below 100 °C (Fig. S13A). The peaks were attributed to the reduction of native RuOx at the surface of Ru NPs, which formed when the catalysts was exposed to air after activation. The main reduction temperature of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst pretreated at 200 °C for 1 h under a pure O2 flow, increased to 200 °C (Fig. S13B). The low-temperature peak associated with native RuOx was not observed in the H2-TPR profile of the spent 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst (Figs. S13C and D). In addition, the H2 consumption of the spent 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst (0.01 mmol g−1) was much lower than that of the fresh 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst (0.028 mmol g−1). These results indicated the reduction of surface RuOx sites during xylose conversion at an initial H2 pressure of 3.0 MPa. Because of the high activity of the passivated 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst (Fig. 6A) and the presence of a native RuO2 layer on the surface of the Ru NPs of the fresh 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst (Fig. S13A), we concluded that the RuO2 particles at the surface of metallic Ru NPs served as critical active sites during the selective conversion of xylose to THFOL. To examine the role of RuO2 during xylose conversion, the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst was subjected to controlled passivation using a pure O2 flow of 30 mL min−1 at 200 °C at different time intervals in the range of 5–25 min. The passivated catalysts are denoted as 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-zO (where z = 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 min represents the passivation time). The passivated 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-zO catalysts were tested for xylose conversion at 180 °C and an initial H2 pressure of 3.0 MPa for 1 h. As the passivation time increased from 5 to 20 min, the THFOL yield increased significantly from 47.2% to 61.8% (Fig. 7 A). A further increase in passivation time to 25 min led to a slight decrease in THFOL yield (53.6%). When the passivation time was increased to 60 min, the THFOL yield further decreased to 38.9%. These results revealed that the optimized RuO2-to-Ru ratio in the passivated catalyst played a critical role in increasing THFOL yield. The space–time yield of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-zO catalyst increased to 85.2 mmol gRu −1 h−1 (Fig. 7A). To examine the role of RuO2 during the conversion of xylose to THFOL, a physical mixture of RuO2 power and Hβ(25) zeolite was used as the catalyst for the conversion of xylose, and a THFOL yield of 22% was achieved (entry 16, Table 2). This indicated that a fraction of the surface RuO2 was reduced during the reaction in the presence of H2, and hydrogenation of the CO groups and furan ring saturation occurred at the surface of the metallic Ru sites. As passivation time was increased from 5 to 25 min, the Ru4+/Ru° ratio, which was measured using the Ru 3p3/2 XPS profile of the catalyst, increased from 0.09 to 1.10 (Fig. 7B). The peak at 280.7 eV in the Ru 3d XPS profiles of the passivated catalysts (Fig. 7C) indicated the formation of an anhydrous RuO2 layer on the metallic Ru surface. The H2-TPR profiles in Fig. 7D confirmed the formation of RuO2 layers on the surface of Ru NPs; the amount of H2 consumed during temperature ramping increased significantly from 0.13 to 0.43 mmol g−1, and the temperature of the main reduction peak increased from 60 to 230 °C as passivation time increased from 5 to 25 min. The excess surface passivation at 25 min could decrease the number of hydrogenation sites on the metallic Ru° surface, which resulted in a decrease in THFOL yield (Fig. 7A). When considering the role of RuO2 at the surface of Ru NPs in the conversion of xylose to THFOL, the THFOL yield over the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-IM catalyst was lower than that over the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst (Table 2). This suggested that the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-IM catalyst might not have facilitated the formation of native RuOx on the surface of metallic Ru NPs. Conversely, the large number of edge and corner sites on the surface of metallic Ru NPs of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst (Fig. 5) could facilitate the formation of a RuO2 layer during air exposure and passivation. This was confirmed by CO-DRIFT analysis of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-zO catalysts synthesized at varying the passivation times from 5 to 20 min (Fig. S14). The peak at 2069 cm–1, which corresponds to the linearly adsorbed CO on the low-coordinated Ru surface atoms (edges/corner sites), was progressively vanished as the passivation time increased, indicating preferential formation of RuOx in the edges and corner sites. The HR-TEM images of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst revealed that the Ru NPs presented an uneven surface (Fig. 7E and F), whereas the Ru NPs of the passivated 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-10O and 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O catalysts presented relatively smooth surfaces (Fig. 7G and H, respectively). The presence of RuO2 was observed at the surface of the Ru NPs of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-10O and 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O catalysts (Fig. 7J and K) and the interplanar spacing of 0.324 nm corresponded to the RuO2(110) plane. According to the Ru K-edge XANES spectra of the passivated 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-zO catalysts, the upshifting degree of the adsorption edges of the passivated catalysts increased with increasing passivation time (Fig. 7M). In addition, the EXAFS profile (Fig. 7N) revealed that the intensity of the peak of the Ru–O bond at approximately 1.5 Å increased with increasing passivation time, indicating that the CN of the Ru–O bonds increased. The elemental map of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O catalyst confirmed the presence of a RuO2 layer on the surface of metallic Ru° (Fig. S15). The aforementioned characterization data confirmed the presence of RuO2 nanopatches on the surface of Ru NPs. The schematic diagram of the formation of RuO2 at the corner and edge sites of Ru NPs is presented in Fig. 7O. Therefore, the formation of a RuO2 layer on the surface of metallic Ru° NPs of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst led to an increase in THFOL yield. It was hypothesized that the RuO2–Ru interfacial region played a critical role in the conversion of xylose to THOFL and could have affected the adsorption strength of FFA and FOL intermediates, which suppressed the transport of intermediates to the acidic sites of the Hβ(25) zeolite support and subsequent humin formation."
13,Optimization of reaction parameters and reusability of passivated catalysts,"3.8 Optimization of reaction parameters and reusability of passivated catalysts To optimize the reaction over the passivated 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O catalyst, reaction parameters, such as temperature and initial H2 pressure, were varied, and the results are presented in Fig. S16. At the low temperature of 160 °C, a fraction of FFA was unconverted, whereas at the high temperature of 190 °C, the yields of byproducts (2-MTHF and THP) increased slightly, resulting in a slight decrease in THFOL yield (59.8%) (Fig. S16A). The 2-MTHF and THP yields over the passivated 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O catalyst were higher than those over the nonpassivated catalyst, implying that the presence of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the RuO2 layer could facilitate hydrogenolysis reactions [98,99]. The low initial H2 pressure of 1.0 MPa resulted in a high yield of unconverted FFA (38.3%); conversely, an increase in initial H2 pressure from 3 to 4.0 MPa did not significantly change xylose conversion and THFOL yield (Fig. S16B). The reusability of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O catalyst was evaluated at 180 °C and an initial H2 pressure of 3.0 MPa for 1 h at the feed-to-catalyst ratio of 5 (w/w) (Fig. S16C). After the first run, the spent catalyst was collected via filtration and was washed with acetone followed by water to remove any acetone- and water-soluble organic species that might have been adsorbed on the catalyst surface. After the washed catalyst was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight, the dried catalyst was calcined at 450 °C for 4 h under an O2 flow to remove humin and coke, followed by reduction at 450 °C for 4 h under a H2/Ar flow. The cascade conversion of xylose to THFOL was not effective over the reactivated catalyst. The THFOL yield decreased from 61.8% to 22.0%, and the FFA yield increased from 0% to 38.2% during the second run. The spent catalyst recovered after the second run was reactivated and subsequently passivated at 200 °C for 20 min using pure O2 gas. The passivated catalysts recovered after the third and fourth runs recovered their initial activity and achieved a xylose conversion of 92% and a THFOL yield of >59%. Therefore, the coke burning–activation–passivation cycle was effective for recovering the activity of the catalyst used for the cascade conversion of xylose to THFOL."
14,Effect of the RuO2–Ru interface on the adsorption of FFA and formation of humin,"3.9 Effect of the RuO2–Ru interface on the adsorption of FFA and formation of humin The nonpassivated 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst favored the selective production of THFOL (42.8%) compared with the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-RD and 3Ru/Hβ(25)-IM catalysts; however, the formation of humin and coke on the surface of the acidic sites should be carefully addressed. Surface passivation of Ru NPs increased the THFOL yield (61.8%) and also suppressed the formation of humin. Therefore, surface passivation was highly effective for accelerating the hydrogenation of FFA and FOL intermediates to THFOL and suppressing humin and coke formation. The formation of coke on the spent catalyst was examined using TGA, and the results are presented in Fig. 8 A. The total weight loss of the spent passivated 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O catalyst after solvent washing was 4.9 wt%, which was much lower than that of the nonpassivated 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst (8.2 wt%) (Fig. 6B). The liquids produced over the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O and 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalysts were clear and brownish, respectively (Fig. 8B). High-molecular-weight species (1000–10,000 g mol−1) were detected in the liquid produced over the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst but not in the liquid produced over the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O catalyst. These results confirmed the beneficial role of RuO2 on the surface of Ru NPs in suppressing the formation of humin and coke over the passivated 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O catalyst. The highly acidic nature of the Hβ zeolite support and catalytic amount of in-situ produced water (from xylose to FFA, 0.054 g water per 1 mmol of xylose) can play a main role in the humin and coke formation, and thus the direct contact of FFA and FOL intermediates with the Hβ zeolite support of the passivated catalyst could be suppressed by facilitating the interactions between FFA/FOL and surface RuO2. To investigate the role of acid sites and water for the formation of humin and coke, xylose conversion at a high feed concentration of 10 mmol was conducted at 180 °C, 40 mL THF, and an initial H2 of 3.0 MPa for 1 h over the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O catalyst. A high xylose conversion of 89% was achieved with FFA as a major product (28.9%). THFOL, 2-MTHF, and THP were produced as minor products with yields of 5.74%, 1.47% and 0.81%, respectively. Interestingly, LA was observed in the product mixture in a noticeable yield of 10.4%, which was not observed in the reaction product at the low xylose concentration. These results indicate that the substantial amount of water produced during the reaction (theoretically, 0.54 g of water produced from 10 mmol of xylose during the FFA production) can shift reaction pathway toward ring-opening of the FFA hydrogenated product, i.e., FOL to LA [100]. To further investigate the formation of humin and coke in the spent catalyst, TGA and GPC profiles were collected (Fig. S12). The weight loss in the spent catalyst collected after the 10 mmol xylose conversion was approximately three times higher than that collected after the 1 mmol xylose conversion. In addition, in the GPC profiles, high-molecular-weight species with 400–500 g mol–1 was observed in the liquid product collected after the 10 mmol xylose conversion. To examine the reason for the increase in THFOL yield over the passivated 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O catalyst and the role of surface RuO2 during the direct conversion of xylose, the adsorption energies of FFA, FOL, and THFOL on the Ru(001), RuO2(110) surfaces, and without surface oxygen bridging of RuO2(110) (denoted as RuOx(110)) were calculated using DFT simulations. The most favorable adsorption modes and corresponding adsorption energies of FFA, FOL, and THFOL are presented in Fig. 8C and D. FFA strongly adsorbed on the Ru(001) surface with a high adsorption energy of −1.58 eV in a flat geometry, and Ru–C bonds formed between Ru atoms and the C atoms in the furan ring. In addition, the –C=O groups of FFA adsorbed on the Ru(001) surface in a η2-(C–O)-aldehyde configuration. The FOL adsorption on the Ru(001) surface was slightly less favorable because the −CH2OH group was repelled from the Ru(001) surface. The adsorption energy of THFOL on the Ru(001) surface was low (−0.57 eV) because of the absence of double bonds in its ring. The presence of surface oxides significantly affected adsorption geometries and energies. The oxygen atoms of the C=O groups of FFA and –OH groups of FOL preferentially adsorbed at the coordinatively unsaturated Ru (Rucus) sites on the RuO2(110) surface. The –C=O groups of FFA adsorbed on the RuO2(110) surface in an η1-(O)-aldehyde configuration. Owing to the absence of Ru–C bonds between Ru atoms and the C atoms in the furan ring, the adsorption energy of FFA on the RuO2(110) surface (−0.91 eV) was significantly lower than that on the Ru(001) surface (−1.58 eV). The adsorption energy of FOL on the RuO2(110) surface (−1.21 eV) was only slightly lower than that on the Ru(001) surface (−1.43 eV) because of the preferential adsorption of the −OH groups on the Rucus sites [99]. The strong adsorption of FOL on the Ru(001) and RuO2(110) surfaces inhibited the diffusion of FOL in the Hβ zeolite framework and direct interaction with the acidic sites of the Hβ zeolite, resulting in a high THFOL yield and suppression of humin formation (Fig. 8E). FOL is highly susceptible to form humin because of the hydrolytic ring opening reaction to form primary humin intermediates [101,102]. The adsorption energies of FFA and FOL on the surface of the RuOx(110) sites were lower (−0.21 and −0.34 eV, respectively) than those on the surface of Ru(001) and RuO2(110), because of the absence of bonds between the surface sites and adsorbates. FFA-DRIFTS analysis was used to further investigate the adsorption geometry of FFA on the passivated catalysts (Fig. 9 A). The FFA-DRIFTS profile of the physically mixed RuO2 and Hβ(25) zeolite powders with a weight ratio of 3:97 is included in Fig. 9A for comparison. The peak associated with the adsorption of C=O at approximately 1626 cm−1 in the FFA-DRIFTS profile of the passivated 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-5O catalyst progressively blue-shifted to 1666 cm−1 as the passivation time increased to 25 min and approached the RuO2 peak. This indicated that the adsorption geometry of FFA changed from an η2-(CO)-aldehyde configuration on the metallic Ru sites to an η1-(O)-aldehyde configuration on the RuO2 sites. The intensities of the IR bands at 1554 and 1457 cm−1, which were attributed to furan ring breathing and ν (C=C), respectively [103], and those of the bands at 1395 and 1370 cm−1, which were assigned to the ρ(CH) rock and deformation bend δ b(O=CH−) of aldehyde groups, respectively [104,105], increased with increasing passivation time. This further confirmed that FFA presented an η1-(O)-aldehyde adsorption mode on the surface of RuO2. A close inspection of the adsorption peaks revealed the presence of three subpeaks at 1626, 1632, and 1666 cm−1 in the FFA-DRIFTS profile of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-5O catalyst (Fig. S17). The peaks at 1626 and 1632 cm−1 were attributed to the C=O groups adsorbed via the η2-(C–O)-aldehyde mode on low- and high-coordinated metallic Ru sites, respectively. The peak at 1666 cm−1 was ascribed to η1-(O)-aldehyde adsorption on the RuO2 sites. Because of the presence of low-coordinated Ru sites on the metal surface, the C=O group was strongly adsorbed by increasing the d–π* electron feedback, resulting in a red shift from 1630 to 1625 cm−1 [20]. Therefore, the presence of the strong adsorption peak at 1626 cm−1 in the FFA-DRIFTS profiles of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-5O and 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-10O catalysts suggested that passivation for 5–10 min did not cover all low-coordinated metallic sites. To elucidate the formation of RuO2 sites of the Ru NPs, the CO-DRIFTS profiles of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD and 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O catalysts at several temperatures in the range of 30–180 °C were analyzed, and the results are presented in Fig. 9B. The peak at 2069 cm−1, which corresponded to the linearly adsorbed CO on the edge or step sites of the Ru NPs, in the CO-DRIFTS profile of the nonpassivated 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst disappeared from the CO-DRIFTS profile of the passivated 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O catalyst, indicating that the edge and step sites of the Ru NPs were oxidized to form RuO2. The adsorption bands in the wavenumber range of 2000–2050 cm−1 were attributed to the linearly adsorbed CO on the metallic Ru surface [91]. The peaks that appeared in the high wavenumber range of 2300–2400 cm−1, which were attributed to gaseous CO2, indicated that the Boudouard reaction (2CO → CO2 + C) was activated over the RuO2–Ru interfacial sites [106]. In addition, the small hump band that emerged at 1995 cm−1 was attributed to the presence of oxygen vacancies on RuO2, which favored the adsorption of CO [107]. The presence of oxygen vacancies on RuO2 could activate the cleavage of the C–O bonds of THFOL to produce 2-MTHF (Fig. 7A); the oxygen vacancies that could form via the dissociative adsorption of H2 on the Rucus sites of RuO2 could act as active sites for C–O bond cleavage [98,99]."
15,Conversion of other feedstocks over the 3Ru/Hβ-ARD-20O catalyst,"3.10 Conversion of other feedstocks over the 3Ru/Hβ-ARD-20O catalyst To demonstrate the versatility of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O catalyst for the synthesis of THFOL, other types of biomass-derived C6 sugars, a combination of C6/C5 sugars, and di- and polysaccharides, such as fructose, glucose, sucrose, and xylan, were used as reactants. Reactions were performed at 180 °C, a feed-to-catalyst ratio of 5 (w/w), and an initial H2 pressure of 3.0 MPa for 1 h. The THFOL yields for the conversion of fructose and glucose were 24.0% and 12.5%, respectively, and FFA intermediates were nondetectable (entries 17 and 18, respectively, Table 2). The other products generated during the conversion of fructose and glucose included isosorbide as the major product and small amounts of 2-MTHF, THP, 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran, 1,2-dihydroxypentane, 2-hydroxytetrahydropyran, tetrahydropyran-2-methanol, and anhydrosugars (Figs. S18 and S19, respectively). The formation of isosorbide indicated that glucose hydrogenation occurred over the metallic Ru sites to form sorbitol, followed by sorbitol dehydration over the acidic sites of the Hβ(25) zeolite to form isosorbide. The intensity of the isosorbide peak in the mixture produced via fructose conversion was lower than that in the mixture produced via glucose conversion. This suggested that isomerization over the Lewis acid sites of the Hβ(25) zeolite was partially suppressed. When sucrose was converted over the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O catalyst at 200 °C, a feed-to-catalyst ratio of 5 (w/w), and an initial H2 pressure of 3.0 MPa for 1 h, a relatively low THFOL yield of 19.6% and a conversion of 76.0% were achieved (entry 19, Table 2). Conversely, the conversion of xylan resulted in a higher THFOL yield of 22.5% and a lower conversion of 62.0% (entry 20, Table 2). The glycosidic Glu(1→2)β-Fru linkages in sucrose and β-1,4-linkages of xylan were cleaved to monosaccharides over the Brønsted acid sites of the Hβ(25) zeolite and, subsequently, the monosaccharides reacted to produce THFOL. Isosorbide, 2-MTHF, THP, 1,2-dihydroxypentane, 2-hydroxytetrahydropyran, tetrahydropyran-2-methanol, and anhydrosugars were generated during the conversion of sucrose and xylan (Figs. S20 and S21, respectively), which were similar to the products obtained via the conversion of fructose and glucose. The ability of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O catalyst to produce THFOL from di- and polysaccharides demonstrated its multifunctionality for cascade tandem depolymerization, isomerization, dehydration, and hydrogenation reactions. Lastly, to confirm the activity of the passivated 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O catalyst, the FFA and FOL intermediates were converted over the nonpassivated 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD and passivated 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O catalysts at 180 °C, a feed-to-catalyst ratio of 5 (w/w), and an initial H2 pressure of 3.0 MPa for 1 h. The THFOL yields for the conversion of FOL(79.0%) and FFA(70.4%) over the passivated 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O catalyst were higher than those over the nonpassivated 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O catalyst (58.0% and 63.3%, respectively, entries 21–24, Table 2). Therefore, the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O catalyst was highly effective for the high-yield conversion of several xylan-derived feedstocks to THFOL."
16,Mechanistic insight into the one-pot cascade conversion of xylose to THFOL,"3.11 Mechanistic insight into the one-pot cascade conversion of xylose to THFOL To further investigate the reaction mechanism for the direct conversion of xylose to THFOL over the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O catalyst, the conversion of xylose was conducted at 180 °C, a feed-to-catalyst ratio of 5 (w/w), and an initial H2 pressure of 3.0 MPa, and the time course results are presented in Fig. 10 A. At a short reaction time of 5 min, xylose conversion was 18% and the main product was FFA (15.0%); the THFOL yield was low (1.2%), and byproducts, such as 2-MTHF and THP, which typically formed during the conversion of THFOL were not observed. In addition, the presence of FOL in the reaction mixture collected after 5 min of reaction was extremely small (1.6%). Upon increasing the reaction time to 15 min, a significant decrease in FFA yield to 3.8% and an increase in THFOL yield to 22.0% were observed. Further increasing the reaction time above 15 min activated the formation of 2-MTHF and THP. Based on the time course reaction results and aforementioned adsorption geometries, a mechanism for the direct conversion of xylose to THFOL over the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O catalyst was proposed (Fig. 10C), as follows. First, xylose was converted to FFA via dehydration over the Brønsted acid sites of Hβ(25) zeolite; subsequent hydrogenation of the C=O bond in FFA produced FOL. Next, the furanic C=C bonds in FOL were saturated to produce THFOL. The significant suppression of humin formation over the passivated 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O catalyst compared to that over the nonpassivated 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst indicated that the behavior of reaction intermediates on the surface of the passivated and nonpassivated catalysts was different. The strong adsorption of FFA in a η2-(C–O)-aldehyde configuration and FOL via Ru–C bonds between Ru atoms and the C atoms in the furan ring facilitated the direct conversion of FFA to THFOL without FOL desorption on the surface of the terrace Ru° sites of the nonpassivated 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst. In contrast, the C=O groups of FFA were adsorbed at the corner or edge sites of the Ru° NPs without forming Ru–C bonds. Therefore, after C=O was hydrogenated to C–OH, FOL was desorbed from the surface. A fraction of desorbed FOL was transported to the acidic sites and formed humin and coke. For the passivated 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O catalyst, RuO2 preferentially formed at the corner and edge sites of Ru NPs. Moreover, the formation of RuO2–Ru interfacial sites led to FOL being strongly adsorbed at interfacial sites, which resulted in a high THFOL yield and suppressed humin formation. The strong adsorption of the FOL intermediate through the interaction between the hydroxyl groups and Rucus sites of RuO2 hindered FOL desorption. The residual furan rings were saturated on the neighboring metallic sites, resulting in the selective production of THFOL rather than hydrogenolysis to 2-MTHF. For the η1-(O)-aldehyde adsorption mode of FFA on RuO2, the conversion of xylose to THFOL over a physical mixture of RuO2 powder + Hβ(25) zeolite (entry 16, Table 2) involved the formation of Ru metal sites during the reaction, which subsequently formed RuO2–Ru interfacial sites. The adsorption of the furan rings on the metallic Ru sites and subsequent ring saturation led to the formation of THFOL. The sufficient number of exposed RuO2–Ru interfacial sites on the Ru NPs of the catalyst resulted in a high THFOL yield. To confirm the direct conversion of FFA to THFOL, in situ FFA hydrogenation DRIFTS profiles over the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O catalyst were obtained (Fig. 10B). After FFA was adsorbed on the catalyst surface, the DRIFTS profiles were collected at a H2 flow of 20 mL min−1 for 1 h at 180 °C. As the H2 flow time increased, the intensity of the characteristic IR bands of FFA gradually decreased. The bands at 1666 and 1716 cm−1, which corresponded to chemisorbed and physiosorbed FFA, respectively [108,109], the bands at 1580 and 1480 cm−1, which corresponded to the vibration of the C=C bonds of the furan ring [103], and the band at 2850 cm−1, which corresponded to the aliphatic C–H bonds of FFA [110], disappeared after 45 min of H2 flow. By contrast, new bands at 1133 and 1166 cm−1, which corresponded to the alcohol C–O groups, started to emerge after 5 min of H2 flow. The bands associated with the furan ring vibrations were still present after 15 min of H2 flow; however, further increasing the H2 flow time to 60 min led to a gradual decrease in the intensity of the bands. After 60 min of H2 flow, the intensity of the bands at 2949 and 2924 cm−1, which were attributed to the C–H bonds of THFOL, increased significantly. Therefore, in the time interval of 5–15 min, FFA was converted to FOL, which was, subsequently, directly converted to THFOL via furan ring saturation with increasing the H2 flow time beyond 15 min without FOL desorption."
17,Conclusion,"In this study, we investigated the one-pot conversion of xylose to THFOL over bifunctional Ru/Hβ catalysts in THF. The catalytic performance was analyzed by assessing the effect of several catalyst synthesis methods, namely IM, RD, ARD, and ARD-O, on the physicochemical properties of Ru NPs deposited on the Hβ zeolite support. The 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O catalyst presented the best performance of all catalysts analyzed in this study. The strong electrostatic interactions at the metal–acid interface of the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O catalyst could induce cascade tandem reactions over the multifunctional active sites. The conversion of xylose at 180 °C for 1 h under an initial H2 pressure of 3.0 MPa resulted in the one-pot consecutive isomerization and dehydration of xylose to FFA and subsequent hydrogenation of FFA to THFOL with a remarkable yield of 61.8 %. The use of polar aprotic solvents as reaction media favored xylose dehydration and FFA intermediate stabilization. The highly rough surface with numerous edge and step sites of Ru NPs in the 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD catalyst favored the formation of a RuO2 oxide layer and the formation of interfacial RuO2–Ru sites in the passivated 3Ru/Hβ(25)-ARD-20O catalyst. The isomerization and dehydration of xylose at the acidic sites of the Hβ(25) zeolite support produced FFA as an intermediate. Thereafter, the direct conversion of FFA to THFOL at the interfacial RuO2–Ru sites with minimal FOL desorption suppressed humin formation and resulted in a high THFOL yield. The results described herein highlight a versatile approach for the development of multifunctional catalysts for one-pot selective reactions during biomass conversion."
