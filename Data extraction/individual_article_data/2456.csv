0,Introduction,"According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the global demand and production of oil and gas resources will increase to another 8–14 % by 2030 [1]. Increasing oil and gas production will create new demand for pipeline steels as using pipelines is considered the safest and most economical way of transporting these natural resources. However, the pipelines also experience failures in harsh environmental conditions that cause damage estimated in trillions of dollars’ annually [2]. The presence of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas in the pipelines is often related to deteriorating mechanical properties and subsequent failure by hydrogen embrittlement [3,4]. When hydrogen atoms concentrate on the surface of the steel, they tend to make hydrogen molecules, however the presence of sulfide ions acts as the poison and prevents the recombination of hydrogen atoms [5]. As a result, the hydrogen atoms diffuse through the steel and trigger hydrogen-induced cracking (HIC). Many proposed theories explain the mechanism of HIC, such as the internal pressure theory, the de-cohesion model, hydride formation and hydrogen enhanced localized plasticity model, which the most accepted one among them is internal pressure theory developed by Zapffe and Sims [6]. According to this theory, diffused hydrogen atoms accumulate in the traps within steel microstructure and form hydrogen molecules. These gas molecules exert internal pressure within steel that initiates the cracks. This process of micro-cracks generation continues until the failure of the pipelines [7]. Several researchers believe that the combination of different mechanisms contribute towards HIC cracking in steels [8,9]. Very different interpretation of the HIC failure mechanism indicates that this mechanism still not fully understood, and more research is needed on this subject. The only accepted fact is that ingress of the hydrogen atoms causes failure. Therefore, it is essential to understand the hydrogen diffusion and trapping within the steel. Various methods were proposed to reduce the susceptibility of the steels to HIC. Desulphurization, inclusion control, micro-alloying, microstructure and texture engineering are some examples of these methods. Modifying the microstructure and texture of the pipeline steels are two innovative methods used extensively by researchers to increase the steels’ resistance to HIC cracking. In order to change the microstructure and texture of the steel, the thermo-mechanical control processing parameters should be altered. These parameters include, but are not limited to, the cooling rate, reduction procedures, rolling and heating temperatures that can significantly change the texture and microstructure of the steel. Many researchers have already reported that certain textures such as ⟨011⟩‖ND and ⟨111⟩‖ND provide additional resistance to HIC cracking in pipeline steels [3,10–12]. The strength of these textures can be improved by optimizing the TMCP parameters, especially the reduction procedure and final rolling temperature. Park et al. [13] modified the microstructure of steel by changing the TMCP parameters and reported that acicular ferrite is the most resistant microstructure to cracking. Tahemiro et al. [14] investigated the effect of TMCP on HIC resistance in pipeline steel. They examined the effect of accelerated cooling after controlled rolling on the HIC resistance of pipeline steels. These researchers concluded that the volume fraction of high carbon martensite or upper bainite formed in the segregated zone is reduced by optimizing the accelerated cooling conditions, and this phenomenon improves significantly the HIC resistance. More importantly, they observed that the hard phases such as M* and Bu is decreased by accelerated cooling. It is notable that the optimized accelerated cooling avoids the carbon rejection from the non-segregated region to segregated zone. This causes a uniform carbon distribution in the through-thickness direction of plate. In this study, it is also reported that by decreasing the cooling rate and terminating the cooling procedure at temperatures between 400 and 500 °C, the segregation of martensite and bainite phases at the middle layer of steel decreased, which led to higher HIC resistance of the stee. In another study, Masoumi et al. [15] utilized a special TMCP to dissolve inclusions and eliminate probable segregation zones. Moreover, they observed that micro-texture plays an important role on the HIC susceptibility. Based on their results, the sharp {110} and {111} texture components accompanied by the negligible proportion of {001}//ND oriented grains can increase HIC resistance in pipeline steel. It has also been implied that hydrogen diffusion coefficient will be maximum at an optimum grain size [16]. Khatib Zadeh et al. [17] found that the samples with the smaller grain size have higher length of hydrogen cracks as they trap more hydrogen diffusion. They understood that grain size difference could affect the concentration of hydrogen diffusion, which leads to the difference of hardness. Researchers use different methods to simulate and measure the HIC resistance of steels. Some use NACE TM0284 standard test [18] to introduce hydrogen atoms into the steel, while others use hydrogen charging for this purpose [19–22]. The difference between the two methods is that in the hydrogen charging method, more hydrogen atoms can ingress into the microstructure of steel, which simulates more closely severe sour environments. In this method the effects of hydrogen diffusion are evaluated by measuring the cracks and blisters on the surface and at the cross-section of the steel. Hydrogen permeation is another experiment used to evaluate the HIC resistance of steels. The hydrogen permeation test allows specifying the type of hydrogen traps inside the microstructure. Scientists categorized the hydrogen traps into reversible and irreversible traps based on their binding energy and hydrogen retention capabilities. They consider a trap as reversible when its binding energy is less than 60 kJ/Mol, such as estimated for the grain boundaries and dislocations. When the binding energy is more than 60 kJ/Mol, the trap is considered irreversible, the inclusions and precipitates are in this class [21,23,24]. According to previous reports, the presence of reversible traps is most often responsible for cracking in steels [25,26]. This cracking mechanism is “internal pressure theory,” which was discussed in our previous report [7]. Although a lot of research have been done toward the development of HIC resistant steels, the results show that there is still more works to be done, as the effect of different TMCP parameters on optimizing the texture and HIC susceptibility is not been well understood. In this study, two different TMCP procedures are introduced to alter the microstructure and texture of the steel. Then the texture and microstructure of specimens are characterized, and the HIC susceptibility of the samples is measured using hydrogen charging and hydrogen permeation methods."
1,Experimental procedure,"This research is conducted on API 5L X70 pipeline steel provided by Evraz co. The chemical composition of the used steel is shown in Table 1 . Two different thermomechanical control processing (TMCP) are used to evaluate the effects of different TMCP parameters on HIC resistance of steel. The TMCP parameters are presented in Table 2 and Fig. 1 . Table 2 shows the temperatures at which various treatment stages were conducted, and Fig. 1 schematically shows the rolling process, highlighting the rolling parameters. Both specimens were subjected to similar thermo-mechanical treatments during the reheating and rough rolling stages. The main difference in their TMCP procedure is the number of finish rolling passes and cooling rates used in the manufacturing procedure. The thickness of plate 1 was reduced in the finish rolling by 75 % in seven passes, while the same reduction was applied for plate 2 in five passes. A small difference in their cooling rate is observed. The cooling rate of plate 1, after finish rolling, is 34.2C/s, while this number is 26.9C/s for plate 2."
2,Microstructural evaluation,"2.1 Microstructural evaluation The microstructure of samples in both middle and top layers was evaluated using SU6600 Hitachi scanning electron microscope (SEM). To prepare the samples, the RD-ND surface of each sample was polished with 180, 320, 400, 600, 800, 1200, 2400 and 4000 grit silicon carbide (SiC) papers followed by diamond polishing using the 3 mm MD-Dac and 1 mm MD-Nap discs. After obtaining a mirror-like surface in the samples, they were etched with 2 % Nital solution (2 vol% nitric acid and 98 vol% alcohol) for 15 s."
3,Phase and texture identification,"2.2 Phase and texture identification SU 6600 Hitachi field emission SEM equipped with an Oxford Instruments Nordlys Nano EBSD detector was used to identify the phase and texture of all specimens across their thickness. The preparation of the samples for this evaluation was the same as described in the previous section, followed by using the Buehler VibroMet 2 vibratory polisher with Master Met 2 polishing suspension for final polishing."
4,Electrochemical hydrogen charging,"2.3 Electrochemical hydrogen charging In order to simulate the sour environment, the samples were charged electrochemically to introduce hydrogen atoms on the surface of specimens. In this method, higher fraction of hydrogen atoms can ingress into the steel than during NACE TM 0284–2016 standard test [27]. In addition, as hydrogen sulfide is a highly flammable, explosive gas may cause life-threatening situations, the hydrogen charging experiment was chosen. The solution which was used in this experiment contained 0.2 M sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and 3 g/L ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN). The ammonium thiocyanate was added to promote hydrogen ingress into the metals by preventing the formation of hydrogen molecules. The samples were immersed in the solution and the constant direct current (DC) density of 20 mA/cm2 supplied by Instek DC power supplier was applied for 24 h for each sample. A cube with dimensions of 25 mm (RD) × 20 mm (TD) × 20 mm (ND) was cut from each plate for this experiment. All surfaces of the samples were then polished according to what was described in the microstructural evaluation section. After charging, the statistical analysis of created blisters and cracks were performed. The specimens were sectioned to reveal the RD-ND surface of the sheets and the cracking analysis was conducted on the cross-section of each sample. To evaluate the effects of different microstructure and texture parameters on the initiation and propagation of cracks, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) measurements were conducted on the cross-section along the cracks. The SEM analysis was used also to measure the blisters on the outer surfaces. The sample preparation for EBSD was similar to that described earlier. The post-processing of all EBSD results was done using Oxford Instruments Channel 5 post-processing software."
5,Hydrogen permeation experiment,"2.4 Hydrogen permeation experiment The hydrogen permeation (HP) testing was used according to the ISO 17081 standard [28] to see the type of traps inside the samples (reversible or irreversible) and the amount of hydrogen absorbed and permeated through them. To prepare the HP test samples, the samples were cut in 25 × 20 × 2 mm3 from both the middle and top layers of each steel plate. After cutting, both surfaces of the specimens were ground with SiC papers from 180 to 4000 grits. The samples were polished with diamond paste to eliminate the flux-limiting surface impedances and having a smoother surface (less than 1 μm). The final thickness of the samples was around 1 mm. The specimens were coated with 20 nm thickness of palladium on either side to decrease the surface corrosion and increase the hydrogen oxidation rates. Devanathan and Stachurski first utilized the permeation testing at the University of Pennsylvania to calculate hydrogen permeation through a palladium membrane [29]. The test setup used in this research was the same as what they had with a small modification to obtain more repeatable results. The charging cell contained 250 ml of 0.1 M sulfuric acid (H2SO4) with 3 g/L of ammonium thiocyanate as the hydrogen recombination poison. The oxidation cell contained 250 ml sodium hydroxide (NaOH) acted as the electrolyte (Fig. 2 ). A 5 mm diameter graphite rod was placed on each cell's lid to serve as the counter electrode. There is the hole embedded on the oxidation cell lid to place saturated calomel as the reference electrode. To deaerating the cells from oxygen, the inert argon gas was used during the testing time. The argon gas inserted slowly to both electrochemical cells. For this reason, two holes were embedded on each lid for inhaling and exhaling the argon gas. Two beakers were connected through their bottom flanges. The sample was placed in the gap between the two flanges. The wire connections of this test are shown in Fig. 3 . The counter electrode in the charging cell acted as the anode, while the sample was connected to the negative pole and acted as the cathode, where the hydrogen generation occurs. The reference electrode, the counter electrode, and the sample were connected to Gamry G750 Potentiostat in the oxidation cell and created the second electrochemical cell, where the diffused hydrogen was oxidized. The DC power supplier provided 5 mA current in the hydrogen production system. In the oxidation cell, the Gamry potentiostat provided 250 mV constant potential. The typical result which was obtained by this experiment looks like Fig. 4 . Some information like the steady-state current (I∞) and time lag (TL), can be extracted from this curve and then used to calculate other parameters. The equations for calculating the permeability coefficient (J∞L), effective diffusivity (Deff), apparent solubility (Capp), and the total number of hydrogen-trapping sites (NT) are given below: Eq. 1 J ∞ L = I ∞ L F A Eq. 2 D e f f = L 2 6 t L Eq. 3 C a p p = J ∞ L D e f f Eq. 4 N T = C a p p 3 ( D L D e f f − 1 ) where, I ∞ (μA), L (cm), A (cm2), F (C/mole), TL (s), and DL (cm2 s−1) are steady-state current, the thickness of the steel membrane, area of the specimen subjected to charging and oxidation cells, Faraday's constant, time lag, and lattice diffusion coefficient, respectively. The steady-state current is found from the curves (Fig. 4), and time lag is the elapsed charging time when the proportion of J (t)/I∞ is equal to 0.63. The lattice diffusion coefficient and Faraday's constant are equal to 1.28 × 10 − 4 ( C m 2 S ) and 96500 ( C m o l ) , respectively. In this test, the sample was charged twice. Both reversible and irreversible traps were filled with hydrogen atoms in the first charging. After stopping the power supply current, the hydrogen atoms captured in reversible traps were discharged. Again, the same current was applied, and the oxidation current was measured. The amount of reversible hydrogen trap sites was calculated using the second oxidation current. The number of irreversible trap sites was calculated from the difference between the first and second oxidation current. The amount of discharged hydrogen in the oxidation side was estimated by calculating the area below the hydrogen permeation current curve in the discharging section."
6,Mechanical testing,"2.5 Mechanical testing Tensile and hardness testing were conducted to evaluate the mechanical properties of the plates. The tensile testing was performed according to ASTM E8/E8M standard test [30] along the rolling direction for both plates. MVK-H1 Mitutoyo hardness tester is used with 1 kg load for 12 s, and the Vickers scale (HV) is reported for all samples. This test is according to ASTM E384-17 standard test [31] and conducted five times for each sample, and the average value is reported for each sample. For performing this test, the surface of all samples is polished with SiC papers from 180 to 4000 grits. To do hardness testing for the samples exposed to the hydrogen charging, they were quickly removed from the charging set-up and tested immediately to minimize the desorption of hydrogen from the steel."
7,Results and discussion,
8,"Microstructure, texture and phase characterization","3.1 Microstructure, texture and phase characterization The microstructure of the samples is evaluated in both middle and top layers using SEM, which is presented in Fig. 5 . As shown in these figures, the microstructure of all specimens mostly consisted of polygonal and acicular ferrite and very small amounts of pearlite (darker regions) around the ferrite boundaries. The grain size of the samples is calculated using the EBSD imaging. The grain size distribution maps of the samples are presented in Fig. 6 . The grain size was evaluated according to the circle equivalent diameter of the grains, and high angle grain boundaries with grain misorientation larger than (15°) are considered for separation of grains. Because of different TMCP in the samples, different grain sizes formed in their microstructure. The grain size statistics of the samples are provided in Table 3 . The TMCP of the specimens directly reflects these grain sizes. Plate 2 has larger grains in comparison with plate 1. This plate was shaped with lower rolling passes. There were six roughing and five finishing passes (Table 2) in this specimen, while these numbers were six and seven for plate 1, respectively. This specimen's cooling rate was lower (26.9C/s), allowing the grains to grow and create larger grains. The phase map of the plates in both top and middle layers is presented in Fig. 7 . From photos, both specimens in the top and middle layers mostly consist of BCC structure. Therefore, comparison between these samples is just about the grain size and other factors, not different phases. According to the literature, the highest resistance to the HIC is for the acicular ferrite phase. However, the lowest strength is also observed in ferrite phase compared to the other phases like bainite or pearlite. The pipeline manufactures choose the optimum combination of ferrite and pearlite microstructures of get the highest strength and toughness. The following text was added to the manuscript about the effect of grain size on HIC susceptibility. Therefore, pipeline manufacturers should increase the strength of steel by adding different alloying elements or creating some additional phases. For instance, adding manganese to the steel increases its strength by solid solution strengthening. Moreover, the manufacturers try to change the microstructure from ferrite to pearlite as it has a higher strength. Therefore, the main objective would be to provide the optimum situation for the product based on the strength and crack propagation resistivity. The effect of grain size on HIC susceptibility is controversial. It is documented that steels with small grain sizes has a high amount of fracture toughness and as a result, they show a high resistance against HIC [32]. However, Yazdipour et al. used 2D modelling of the effect of grain size on hydrogen diffusion in API X70 pipeline steel and showed that the highest HIC resistance happens in an optimum grain size [33]. Fine grains provide a high volume fraction of grain boundaries. These fine grains can reduce the rate of hydrogen diffusion by providing inhibitors such as triple junctions, nodes and other structural defects. On the other side, a high volume fraction of fine grains provides high stored strain energy in grain boundaries and may facilitate crack propagation. The IPF map of the specimens is shown in Fig. 8 . According to these photos, there is no dominant texture in any of the samples and both specimens, in their top and middle layers, consist of grains distributed in different directions. In this condition, the HIC cracks can easily propagate [34,35] and make it impossible to measure the HIC susceptibility of these specimens based on their texture. The kernel average misorientation (KAM) of the plates in both top and middle layers is shown in Fig. 9 . According to this figure, the misorientation degree and, as a result, the dislocation density of plate 1 is higher than plate 2 in both layers. The higher dislocation density is most likely related to higher cooling rate and they can act as the hydrogen traps. The recrystallization fraction of the specimens in both top and middle layers are shown in Fig. 10 . In this figure, the blue, yellow, and red colors represent the recrystallized grains, sub structured, and deformed grains, respectively. The detailed recrystallization fraction of the BCC phase for the specimens is presented in Table 4 . From the table, the highest deformed fraction belongs to plate 1 in both top and middle layers. On the other hand, the fraction of recrystallized phases has the opposite manner, and plate 1 has a lower recrystallized fraction compared to plate 2 in both top and middle layers. The table also shows that the greatest fraction of the BCC structure in the samples remains in their initial shape (>72 % Sub-structured fraction)."
9,Mechanical properties,"3.2 Mechanical properties The tensile and hardness testing results of the samples are presented in Table 5 . According to the table, the yield and ultimate stresses of plate 2 are higher than plate 1. By decreasing the grain size, the length of grain boundaries increases which leads to increasing the strength of metal. This table shows that the grain size is the parameter that affect the steel's strength. However, difference between strength of the specimens is not significant. The grain size in plate 2 is higher than the plate 1. In our opinion, even though the hardness of steel is proportional to its strength, several other factors may intervene in determining the hardness of steel. For instance, the inclusions and precipitates which are non-uniformly distributed in the microstructure of steel increase the local hardness of steel. In this research, it was observed that the hardness of steel in the top layer of plate 1 is higher than the plate 2 which is normally justifiable with the dependence of hardness to the strength of steel. However, as one move to the middle layer, it is seen the local hardness of plate 2 becomes higher than that of plate 1. As is clear, the center of cross section is the region where center segregation of elements occurs. This phenomenon has a considerable effect on the local hardness of steel. In this matter, Moon et al. [36] investigated the role of Ca treatment in HIC of hot rolled API pipeline steel in acid sour environment and observed that hard phases having high hardness are created around the mid-thickness of the final product by phase transformation. Moreover, the grain size of steel plays an important role in determining of the local hardness of steel. As is seen in figure below, according to the Hall-Petch equation for hardness, the hardness of steel is also inversely proportional with the grain size [37]. Eq. 5 HV=HV0+kd−0.5"
10,HIC testing results,"3.3 HIC testing results As mentioned in the procedure section, the specimens were electrochemically charged to evaluate specimens’ resistance to HIC cracking. The hydrogen charging causes cracking and blistering on the surface of specimens. The blisters of the specimens are shown in Fig. 11 . The mechanism of blister formation has not been fully understood. However, based on some investigations [38–40], superabundant vacancies are formed by hydrogen atoms and these vacancies and hydrogen are gathered into a small cavity [38]. Hydrogen atoms are combined to form hydrogen gas, which stabilizes the cluster. This phenomenon results in blister formation. It is notable that the pressure inside the cavity increases due to the further growth of hydrogen atoms and their combination. The cluster-hydrogen binding energy and hydrogen pressure make the diffusion of vacancies into the cluster. The cluster grows via combination with vacancies. Some other mechanisms for hydrogen blisters are suggested by researchers. For instance, Li et al. [39] studied the role of hydrogen charging time on hydrogen blisters in pure iron. They concluded that hydrogen crack nucleation from grain boundaries bends the surface outwards to create hydrogen blister. The addition of some special elements may change the mechanism of blister formation. For instance, it has been reported that Nb addition to X80 pipeline steel affects the blister nucleation site and its amount [40]. Fig. 11 shows that the different blisters with different shapes and diameters formed after the hydrogen charging of the specimens. The statistical analysis of blisters is presented in Table 6 . In this table, the percentage of blisters on the surface is presented, which pointed out the friction of the blisters' area to the whole exposed area of the specimens. The length of cracking is the summation of all cracks' length in the cross-section of the specimens. According to Table 6, the number of blisters formed in plate 1 is lower than in plate 2, but the smallest blisters are found on the surfaces of plate 2 with an average diameter of 325 μm and only 0.24 % of the surface. The cross-section of the samples is used to characterize the HIC cracking of the samples. These cross-sections indicate the RD-ND surface of the steels. Thus, the samples are cut through their blisters to evaluate the samples’ crack initiation and propagation sites. The analysis of the cracks (Table 6) is done using these surfaces. Fig. 12 shows the cross-section of plate 2 used for the cracking characterization. Fig. 12 presents a crack formed underneath the blister on the surface of plate 2. Some other cracks on the cross-section of samples are considered in calculating the total length of cracks in Table 6 but are not shown here. According to our observations, plate 2 had a lower total crack length (4.16 mm) than plate 1 (6.48 mm)."
11,Texture characterization of the specimens around the cracks,"3.4 Texture characterization of the specimens around the cracks One of the objectives of this study is to understand the effects of microstructural texture on the HIC cracking of the pipeline steels. Therefore, the grain orientation around their cracks was measured to characterize the crack initiation sites and evaluate the role of texture on the crack initiation. For this reason, the RD-ND cross-section of the samples was analyzed. Many cracks were observed on this cross section that the tip of two cracks are selected for further analysis. The texture of the samples around the cracks are presented in Figs. 13 and 14 . The legends of both figures are the same, and they are mentioned just in the first set of photos. The recrystallization fraction of specimens around the cracks is presented in Table 7 . From the table below and recrystallized fraction photos, it can be concluded that the recrystallized grains are less likely to form the crack (less than 13 %). The cracks are formed primarily in the deformed grains. From the Kernel Local Misorientation (KLM) photos, it seems that the angle of misorientations is higher around the cracks. A higher KLM angle means higher dislocation density in the steel [20]. Dislocations are considered reversible traps and can facilitate hydrogen movement through the metal. The hydrogen diffusion accelerate the HIC cracking in the steels [7], and that is why higher KLM angles are observed around the cracks. In the literature, it is mentioned that the <111> oriented grains are more HIC resistant while <001> oriented grains are the least resistant grains to HIC cracking [11,12]. However, the IPF map of our samples does not prove it. The IPF map around the cracks shows many different grain orientations, indicating that the creation of cracks might not be orientation dependent. Figs. 13 and 14 also show the trans-granular cracking in both samples. The presence of the small grains on both sides of the cracks is often observed."
12,Hydrogen permeation results,"3.5 Hydrogen permeation results The permeation test is conducted for the specimens in both top and middle layers according to the explained permeation experimental procedure at standard room temperature (23 °C) and room pressure (1 atm). The test results are presented in Table 8 . Some significant results can be gained from this table. First, by looking at the reversible traps in these specimens, the direct relationship between the grain size and the number of these traps is apparent. The highest amount of reversible traps (341.6) is for the plate 1 specimen at its top layer, which has the smallest grain size among all other specimens (1.9 μm). On the other side, the lowest amount of reversible traps is for the plate 2 specimen at its middle layer, in which the average grain size is 3.3 μm. From these results, it seems that increasing the grain size will reduce the grain's boundaries and triple junctions, which count as the steels' main reversible traps. By comparing the first and second polarization parameters, it is seen that the steady-state current and permeability of the first polarization is higher than the second one in the plates for both the middle and top layers. The reason is the presence of the irreversible traps inside the metal. The hydrogen atoms saturate these traps after the first polarization, reducing the hydrogen flux for the second polarization. From Table 8, it can be seen that the number of irreversible traps in the middle layer of both plates is significantly higher than their top layers. This is because of inclusions segregation in the middle of the sheets. The inclusions are counted as irreversible traps, and the hydrogen atoms trap in them for longer times. Finally, the total number of traps in the middle layer of both plates is almost the same as in their top layers. Although the number of reversible traps is higher in the specimens’ top layers, there are a higher number of irreversible traps in the middle layer of both specimens, and the total number of traps remains constant. Fig. 15 a shows the relationship between grain size and the number of reversible traps in both the middle and top layers of the samples. According to this figure, as the grain size increases, the number of reversible traps decreases. The top layer of plate one consists of the smallest grains that lead to the maximum amounts of reversible traps in its microstructure. On the other hand, the middle layer of plate two, which has the largest grains, contains the minimum reversible traps. These results prove the inverse relationship between grain size and the reversible traps and that the grain boundaries act as the reversible traps in the steel microstructure. According to Fig. 15b, the number of total tarps first increases which the increase of grain size. However, with the increase of grain size, the number of total traps considerably decreases. Finally, when the grain size exceeds 3 μm, the density of total traps increases."
13,Conclusion,"The HIC susceptibility of two API X70 pipeline steel plates manufactured with different TMCP parameters was assessed using a microstructural evaluation after hydrogen charging and hydrogen permeation testing. Based on the results obtained, the following conclusions were made: (1) Different used TMCP parameters did not change the phases of the plates significantly. Both plates have acicular and polygonal ferrite and a small amount of pearlite, mostly around the grain boundaries. The IPF map of the samples in both middle and top layers demonstrates that there is no dominant texture in the samples and that the grains are distributed randomly. However, the higher number of reduction steps leads to the generation of smaller grains with the same total reduction percentage. Also, plate 2 was cooled with the lower rate that allowed the grains to grow and create larger grains compared with plate 1. On the other side, the recrystallization fraction of microstructure decreases with increasing cooling rate and finish rolling steps. (2) Increasing the grain size leads to better resistance of the steel to the HIC cracking. In this study, plate 2, which has larger grains, shows the lower cracks length and smaller blisters' diameter. The trans-granular cracking was observed in the sour environment in all samples. The reason is the strong grain boundaries in ambient temperatures (compared with GB strength in high temperatures), which prevents the intergranular cracking. (3) In this study, plate 1, which has a higher number of reversible traps, has poor resistance to HIC cracking. The reason for the higher number of reversible traps in plate 1 is the smaller grain size. Moreover, plate 1, which has higher misorientation angles and more deformed grains, is more susceptible to HIC cracking. So, it is possible to conclude that more finish rolling steps and faster cooling rates will increase the number of reversible traps and facilitate HIC cracking. (4) By comparing the specimens' hardness, it is apparent that there is a direct relationship between the hardness and the grain size. Plate 1 is harder (219 HV) than plate 2 (202 HV), and their average grain size is 1.9 and 2.8 μm, respectively. After the hydrogen charging of the samples, the hardness of them increased by 6–8%. The highest increment was observed for plate 2 (7.9 % of the increase), while this number is 6.8 % in plate 1. The hardness increment of the specimen with larger grains was bigger than in the specimen with smaller grains. Increasing hydrogen concentration creates hydrogen atmosphere around dislocations and lock them. So the stress required to change the plastic deformation increased which cause hardening."
