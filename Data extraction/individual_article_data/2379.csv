0,Introduction,"Biological processes for the production of hydrogen are more environment-friendly and less energy intensive than thermochemical and electrochemical processes [1–3]. Biohydrogen can be produced by photosynthetic microorganisms [4] or non-photosynthetic fermentative bacteria. Non-photosynthetic fermentative bacteria produce hydrogen without light under anaerobic conditions, which makes the bioreactor design much simpler than for photosynthetic microorganisms. These fermentative bacteria include Enterobacter [5–9], Bacillus [10], Rhodopseudomonas [11], and Clostridium [12] species. Some of these are facultative anaerobes and others are obligate anaerobes. Some Enterobacter species (facultative anaerobe) can degrade soluble starch [13], while some Clostridium species (obligate anaerobe) can degrade insoluble starch and cellulose without any pretreatment. The hydrogen production yield per unit carbon source is higher with obligate anaerobes than with facultative anaerobes. Despite this many studies on hydrogen production have used facultative anaerobes. This is in part due to the difficulty in maintaining the strict anaerobic conditions needed with obligate bacteria [14]. Obligate anaerobes are extremely sensitive to trace amounts of dissolved oxygen, resulting in the need for expensive reducing agents to be added to the culture medium. However, facultative anaerobes are less sensitive to dissolved oxygen, and the activity of the enzyme involved in hydrogen production recovers rapidly from oxygen damage when depleted in the culture medium. Compared with obligate anaerobes, the rates of cell growth and hydrogen production are higher, and the total operation time for the hydrogen production is lower. Various facultative anaerobes have been examined for their potential in hydrogen production. Enterobacter cloacae IIT-BT 08 was reported to show a high maximum volumetric hydrogen production rate of 447 ml H 2 / l / h [15]. Other facultative anaerobic Enterobacter aerogenes strains such as HU-101, AY-2, and HO-39 have been also investigated [6,8]. As part of an ongoing study aimed at isolating new microorganism with a higher capability of hydrogen production than previously reported ones, a new fermentative bacterium, Enterobacter asburiae, was isolated from a landfill. It was found that this strain has unique properties in hydrogen production, which has not been observed in other hydrogen-producing strains. In this study, the hydrogen production performance by this strain was examined under various culture conditions in order to determine the optimal conditions for the maximal hydrogen production."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Isolation of the bacterial strain,"2.1 Isolation of the bacterial strain The hydrogen-producing bacterial strain was isolated from a domestic landfill. The strain was isolated using a method described elsewhere [16]. Soil samples were collected from several domestic landfill areas and incubated in 50ml of an LB medium for several hours. After incubation, 0.5ml of the supernatant was transferred to 50ml of minimal medium consisting of 50mM L-homophenylalanine (L-HPA) as the sole nitrogen source, 50mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 100mM glycerol, 1 g / l MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O , 0.2mM CaCl 2 , 0.1mg/l ZnCl 2 , 0.1mg/l MnSO 4 · 4 H 2 O , 0.02mg/l H 3 BO 3 , 0.1mg/l CuSO 4 · 5 H 2 O , 0.05mg/l CoCl 2 , 0.1mg/l NiSO 4 · 6 H 2 O, 2.0mg/l NaMoO 4 , and 4.0mg/l FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O . After cultivation at 37 ∘ C for 2 days, 0.5ml of the culture broth was diluted in 50ml of the same minimal medium (100-fold dilution). These procedures were repeated three times in order to simulate the enrichment culture. After the enrichment steps, the culture broth was spread out on an agar plate with the same composition as the minimal media. Each colony on the plate was cultivated in the same type of minimal or LB media. The method used to isolate the strain was originally used for the screening of microorganisms possessing an amino acid transferase [15]. The microorganisms screened by this method also showed extremely high dehydrogenase activity, which is a malate dehydrogenase-like enzyme (personal communication). Microorganisms possessing a high dehydrogenase activity that is involved in NADH production are expected to be good hydrogen producers. Among the 30–40 colonies obtained after the enrichment steps, several isolates were further examined for hydrogen production. The strain with the highest level of hydrogen production in the evolved gas among the isolates was selected. This strain was stored in a 25% glycerol solution at - 70 ∘ C for further use."
3,Biochemical test and fatty acid analysis,"2.2 Biochemical test and fatty acid analysis An API 20E Kit (BioMerieux, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used for the biochemical tests. The fatty acids were analyzed to determine the taxonomy of the isolate. The fatty acid methyl esters were prepared from the biomass grown on triptic soy agar (TSA) at 30 ∘ C for 1 day and were identified using a Microbial Identification System (Microbial ID, Inc., USA) [17]."
4,16S rDNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis,"2.3 16S rDNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis 2.3.1 DNA extraction The chromosomal DNA was isolated using a slight modification of the method reported by Pitcher et al. [18]. Small amounts of biomass from the glucose–yeast extract agar plates were mixed and gently homogenized in 100 μ l of T.E. buffer (pH 8) supplemented with 50mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma, Ltd., Poole, Dorset, UK). The resulting solutions were incubated at 37 ∘ C overnight. The aqueous layers were separated by centrifugation and extracted with chloroform isoamyl alcohol (25:1, vol/vol). After the RNase treatment, the DNA was extracted with phenol and chloroform. 2.3.2 Determination of 16S rDNA sequence A large fragment of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR using the universal primers 27F ( 5 ′ -AGA GTT TGA TCM TGG CTC AG- 3 ′ ) and 1522R ( 5 ′ -AAG GAG GTG WTC CAR CC- 3 ′ ) [19]. The PCR products were purified using a Wizard PCR Preps DNA Purification System (Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and sequenced using a BigDye TM Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) and a model 3100 automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems, USA). The closest known relatives of the new isolates were determined by performing a sequence database search. The sequences of the closely related strains were retrieved from GenBank and the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) libraries. The nucleotide (NT) sequence similarities were calculated using the PHYDIT program [20]. 2.3.3 Phylogenetic analysis Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the neighbor-joining methods [21]. Evolutionary distance matrices were generated using the method reported by Jukes and Cantor [22]. The resultant neighbor-joining tree topology was evaluated using bootstrap analyses based on 1000 samples [23]. Alignment and phylogenetic analyses were carried out using the PHYDIT program (available at http://chunlab.snu.ac.kr/jphydit/)."
5,Strain identification by DNA hybridization,"2.4 Strain identification by DNA hybridization DNA–DNA hybridization was carried out based on a membrane filter technique using a DIG High Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Starter Kit II (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany). The genomic DNA (300ng) was denatured using the alkaline method, and immobilized on a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham, UK) by applying a low vacuum. The DNA preparations (2000ng) were labeled using the DIG High Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Starter Kit II according to the manufacturer's protocol. The membranes were then prehybridized in a hybridization solution at 42 ∘ C for 30min. The actual prehybridization was carried out in a hybridization solution containing the labeled DNA (25ng/ml) at 65 ∘ C for 16h. After hybridization, the membranes were washed twice in a primary washing solution ( 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS) and twice in a secondary solution ( 0.5 × SSC and 0.1% SDS) at 65 ∘ C . The detection reagents were added to the membranes for 5min at room temperature, and the membranes were exposed to autoradiography film (Hyperfilm-ECL, Amersham Biosciences, UK) for 15min. The signal intensities were determined using the TINA 2.0 program. The signal produced by the self-hybridization of the probe with the homologous target DNA was considered to be 100%, and the percentage similarity was determined for the duplicate samples."
6,Bacterial cell culture,"2.5 Bacterial cell culture The cells were cultured at 37 ∘ C in a 1l fermentor (working volume 400ml) under anaerobic conditions and stirred at an impellor speed of 220rpm. The seed was cultured in a 120ml serum bottle (working volume 20ml) at 37 ∘ C and agitated in a shaking incubator at 220rpm. The serum bottle was purged with nitrogen gas to produce the required anaerobic conditions and sealed with a 12mm-thick butyl rubber septum and an aluminum cap. After seed cultivation, the inoculum was transferred anaerobically into the fermentor at the late exponential phase. After inoculation, the fermentor was purged with nitrogen gas for 20min to produce the anaerobic conditions. The PYG medium containing 10g/l glucose, 20g/l peptone, 3g/l yeast extract, 0.5g/l MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O , and 2g/l KH 2 PO 4 was used for fermentation. The pH was set to various levels in the fermentor using 2N HCl and 2N NaOH. The concentrations of all components in medium except for glucose were fixed in all experiments. The cell concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 680nm using a spectrophotometer (Genesys, Spectronic Instruments, USA). One unit of absorbance was equal to 0.42g dry cell/l."
7,Analysis of liquid and gas phases,"2.6 Analysis of liquid and gas phases The glucose concentration was analyzed using an enzymatic method (Glucose HK Assay Kit, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, USA). The organic acids and alcohols in the culture broth were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (HP1100, Agilent Technologies, USA), which was equipped with an Aminex HPX-87H packed column ( ∅ 300 × 7.8 mm ; Bio-Rad, USA). Prior to injection, the liquid samples were purified through a 0.2 μ m disposable filter. A refractive index detector (RID) was used to quantify the organic acids and alcohols. A 0.01N H 2 SO 4 solution at 0.6ml/min was used as the mobile phase and the column temperature was kept at 40 ∘ C . The injection volume of the samples was 10 μ l . The H 2 concentration in the gas phase was analyzed by gas chromatography (HP 5890 Series II, Hewlett-Packard, USA), which was equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a Carboxen-1000 column (Supelco, USA) [24]. Argon (Ar) was used as the carrier gas at 58ml/min. The oven, injector, and detector were maintained at 30, 120, and 120 ∘ C , respectively."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Phenotypic characterization of the hydrogen-producing isolate,"3.1 Phenotypic characterization of the hydrogen-producing isolate The hydrogen-producing bacterium was isolated from several domestic landfill areas. Biochemical test carried out to identify the isolate (data not shown) indicated that the strain belonged to the genus Enterobacter and had a 90.9% similarity to Enterobacter cloacae. Table 1 shows the fatty acid composition of the isolate. The result was compared with the TSBA40 (aerobic bacteria database) and CLIN40 databases (clinical bacteria database), which indicated an 84.2% similarity with the Escherichia coli GC subgroup C on the TSBA40 database and a 62.7% similarity with Escherichia hermannii on the CLIN40 database. 16S rRNA gene full sequencing was carried out to identify the isolated strain, and the 1377bp sequence was determined. Based on the similarity of the 16S rRNA gene, the isolate was found to be analogous to Enterobacter asburiae JCM 6051 T (99.56%), Pantoea agglomerans JCM 1236 T (99.42%), and Enterobacter cancerogenus LMG 2693 T (99.27%). A phylogenetic tree was constructed (Fig. 1 ). Because the species of the isolate could not be determined by the 16S rDNA analysis, DNA–DNA hybridization was performed for more accurate identification using a DIG High Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Starter Kit II (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany). The isolate had the highest similarity to Enterobacter asburiae JCM 6051 T (76.7%). Two strains are considered to be the same species if the similarity is higher than 70%. Therefore, the isolate was determined to belong to Enterobacter asburiae and was designated Enterobacter asburiae SNU-1. The major fermentative bacteria used for hydrogen production includes several Enterobacter and Clostridium species. Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia cloacae are known to produce hydrogen from carbohydrates. The Enterobacter species isolated in this study is a new species that has not been examined for hydrogen production."
10,Batch fermentation profiles of the isolated strain,"3.2 Batch fermentation profiles of the isolated strain Fig. 2 shows the fermentation profiles of the isolated hydrogen-producing bacterial strain, Enterobacter asburiae SNU-1. Hydrogen production began when cell growth entered the late exponential phase, and the rate of hydrogen production reached a maximum in the early stationary phase (Fig. 2a, b). Most of the hydrogen was produced in the stationary phase. Hydrogen production in the stationary phase might be due to the decomposition of formate that accumulates during the exponential phase. Fig. 2c shows the pH and metabolite profiles during the anaerobic culture when the pH was not controlled. The pH decreased from 7.1 to 5.7 and reached a minimum after 7h. The pH then increased from 5.7 to 6.6. The initial decrease in pH was attributed to the accumulation of organic acids [5–9,12]. The time to reach the minimum pH matched the time to reach the maximum formate concentration. The concentrations of the other acidic compounds were relatively low. This suggests that the decrease in pH before 7h was mainly due to the accumulation of formate in the fermentation broth, and the increase in pH after 7h was caused by the consumption of formate. At this point, the cells almost reached the stationary phase because the glucose was almost completely consumed. The cells then need to use another carbon source, which was formate in this case. At this point, formate consumption began, which resulted in an increase in pH and hydrogen production. This hydrogen production is believed to occur through formate decomposition, which works at high formate concentrations via formate hydrogen lyase (FHL) [25]. The hydrogen yield based on the formate consumption was 0.43mol hydrogen/mol formate (Fig. 3 ). The glucose concentration was zero in the stationary phase and the concentrations of other metabolites were maintained at a constant level, as shown in Fig. 2c. Therefore, the level of formate production would be negligible in the stationary phase. However, between 7 and 8h, the yield was 1.43mol hydrogen/mol formate, which was the deceleration phase. It is believed that a yield > 1.0 mol hydrogen/mol formate, which is the theoretical maximum, is caused by the production of formate. The calculation of the yield was based on the assumption that no formate would be produced. However, formate might be still produced during this period. This formate production was not considered in this calculation, which resulted in an overestimation of the yield. Biohydrogen from Enterobacter species is mainly produced through two different ways. One is via formate decomposition, which evolves hydrogen by FHL [1]: HCOOH → H 2 + CO 2 . The other one is the NADH pathway, which evolves hydrogen by hydrogenase through the reoxidation of NADH that is produced via the glycolysis [26]: NADH + H + → NAD + + H 2 ."
11,Effect of pH on hydrogen production,"3.3 Effect of pH on hydrogen production As fermentation progresses, various organic acids accumulate resulting in a significant decrease in pH in the culture medium. This decrease in pH caused a significant decrease in hydrogen production. Table 2 shows the effect of pH on the growth of Enterobacter asburiae SNU-1 and the level of hydrogen production. The results show that Enterobacter asburiae SNU-1 can produce hydrogen at pH 4–7.5, whereas, strictly anaerobic Clostridium butyricum CGS5, which was isolated from anaerobic sewage sludge, did not produce any hydrogen at pH 5 [12]. However, pH control is important for the efficient production of hydrogen by Enterobacter asburiae SNU-1. The level of cell growth increased with increasing pH from 4 and reached a maximum at pH 7, as shown in Table 2. However, the hydrogen production behavior was different from that of cell growth. A local maximum for hydrogen production was obtained at pH 5.5, i.e. the level of hydrogen production was higher at pH 5.5 than either pH 5 or 6. Although the reason for this is unclear, this phenomenon was repeatedly observed. The local maximum at pH 5.5 might be caused by a different effect of pH on the cell growth and the hydrogen production per unit cell. The pH 7 was favorable to the cell growth while pH 5.5 was favorable to the specific hydrogen production. The level of hydrogen production per unit volume without pH control was similar to that with the pH set to 6 or 6.5. This is because the pH varied in this range during the period of hydrogen production, as shown in Fig. 2c. Although the level of hydrogen production had a local maximum at pH 5.5, it has a global maximum at pH 7. When the pH was set to pH 7, the level of hydrogen production/unit volume and the maximum hydrogen productivity were 665ml/l and 175ml/l/h, respectively."
12,Effect of initial glucose concentration,"3.4 Effect of initial glucose concentration The initial glucose concentration usually plays an important role in hydrogen production [12,13]. The effect of the initial glucose concentration on hydrogen production was examined during anaerobic cultivation at pH 7. Both the final cell concentration and the level of hydrogen production increased with increasing initial glucose concentration up to 25g/l, as shown in Fig. 4 . The final level of hydrogen production per unit working volume and the overall hydrogen productivity reached a maximum, when the initial glucose concentration was 25 g/l. This means that the optimal glucose concentration for hydrogen production is 25g/l. The maximum and overall hydrogen productivity at an initial glucose concentration of 25g/l was 398 and 174ml/l/hr, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4. The final level of hydrogen production per unit working volume decreased when the initial glucose concentration was 50g/l. In this case, the glucose was not completely consumed even when cells entered the stationary phase. This was attributed to the depletion of other nutrients before the glucose had been completely consumed. However, the residual glucose was still consumed during the stationary phase, and hydrogen production continued for up to 46h (data not shown)."
13,Hydrogen production of Enterobacter asburiae SNU- 1 from various carbon sources,"3.5 Hydrogen production of Enterobacter asburiae SNU- 1 from various carbon sources Fermentative bacteria use various carbon sources for hydrogen production. Therefore, the level of hydrogen production of Enterobacter asburiae SNU-1 from various carbon sources was examined. The concentration of each carbon source was fixed at 10g/l. Fig. 5 shows that Enterobacter asburiae SNU-1 can produce hydrogen from various carbon sources such as monosaccharides (glucose, fructose), disaccharides (sucrose, lactose), polysaccharides (starch), and alcohols (sorbitol, glycerol). However, the amount produced from lactose, starch, and glycerol was quite low. The highest level of hydrogen production was obtained from sucrose but a similar amount of hydrogen was produced from glucose and fructose. Enterobacter asburiae SNU-1 was also able to utilize polysaccharides such as soluble starch, and alcohols such as sorbitol and glycerol. However, cellulose was unsuitable as a carbon source for hydrogen production without a pretreatment."
14,Conclusions,"A hydrogen-producing bacterial strain was isolated from a domestic landfill, and identified as a new species, Enterobacter asburiae SNU-1. The level of fermentative hydrogen production by this strain was influenced by the medium pH and the initial glucose concentration. The optimum initial glucose concentration and pH were 25g/l and 7, respectively, which resulted in a respective maximum and overall hydrogen productivity of 398 and 174ml/l/hr, respectively. A direct comparison of the hydrogen production potential between various strains is difficult because the level of hydrogen production is reported in different ways including the volumetric hydrogen production rate and the specific hydrogen production rate, etc. Recently, the highest maximum volumetric rate of hydrogen production per unit working volume from C. butyricum CGS5 was reported to be 209ml H 2 / l / h from 20g COD sucrose/l ( = 17.8 g / l ) [12]. In this study, Enterobacter asburiae SNU-1 had a higher hydrogen production potential than that reported for C. butyricum CGS5. This strain has unique properties in hydrogen production. Hydrogen production by microorganisms usually shows growth-associated behavior. However, this strain produced hydrogen in the stationary phase. Hydrogen production in the stationary phase is considered to be due to the result of decomposition of the formate that accumulated during the exponential phase. This formate is decomposed by the FHL complex, which is more active at high formate concentrations. This non-growth-associated hydrogen production is suitable for applications in fuel cells. Although formic acid can be used directly as a fuel source in fuel cells, the hydrogen-fueled fuel cell is more efficient. In this aspect, the harvested cells of this strain can be used as a bioreformer, which convert the formic acid to hydrogen. The harvested cells are expected to play a role as a whole cell biocatalyst in the bioreformer. However, more study will be needed before this strain can be applied to fuel cells."
