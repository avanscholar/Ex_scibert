0,Introduction,"One-pot tandem/cascade reactions, which enable multistep reactions to occur in one pot without having to isolate the intermediates, offer enormous advantages and have attracted extensive research interest [1,2]. Multifunctional catalysts containing different catalytically active sites in a site-isolation manner to maintain their independent function are usually required for one-pot tandem/cascade reactions. Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are a class of 3D crystalline micro-/mesoporous hybrid material constructed from metal or metal cluster nodes interconnected with multidentate organic linkers [3–10]. The structure of MOFs allows the integration of different components as single active catalytic sites into a single MOF material, and thus offers vast opportunities for developing MOF-based multifunctional catalysts [11–14]. Among all the MOF-based materials, the MNPs/MOFs (MNPs = metal nanoparticles) nanocomposites have been the most extensively studied since both MNPs and MOFs are active catalysts and especially, MOFs can provide stabilization for small MNPs to inhibit their growth and aggregation during the reaction [15–18]. Recently, MOFs are emerging as a new type of photocatalysts [19–26]. As a result, by coupling the MOF-based photocatalysis with MNPs-based catalysis, the MNPs/MOFs nanocomposites have also been applied in several light induced tandem/cascade reactions [27–30]. The N-alkylation of amines to produce N-alkyl amines is one of the most important functional group transformations in organic chemistry since N-alkyl amines and their derivatives are important building blocks for the generations of agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and bioactive molecules [31–33]. An attractive route for the productions of N-alkyl amines is the direct alkylation of amines with alcohols as alkylating agents since such a reaction has high atom efficiency and produces water as the only byproduct [34,35]. In addition to homogeneous Ru-/Ir-based catalysts [36,37], multifunctional heterogeneous noble MNPs have also been applied since it is generally believed that N-alkylation reaction follows a hydrogen auto-transfer mechanism containing three consecutive catalytic steps: dehydrogenation of alcohols to aldehydes, condensation of aldehydes with amines to imines, and hydrogenation of imines to N-alkyl amines. [34,36,38,39]. Recently, with an aim of developing renewable energy based processes, a variety of MNPs/photocatalysts nanocomposites, including MNPs/TiO2 (M = Pd, Au, Cu-Mo alloy) and PdNPs@MIL-100(Fe), have also been applied to realize the N-alkylation reactions by coupling the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of alcohols to form aldehydes with the MNPs-based hydrogenation of imines [27,40–42]. Our previous study reported that PdNPs@MIL-100(Fe) act as a multifunctional catalyst for light induced N-alkylation reaction, in which MIL-100(Fe) acts as a photocatalyst for the dehydrogenation of alcohols to generate aldehydes, and the Lewis acidic Fe3+ promotes the condensation between aldehydes and amines to form imines, while PdNPs catalyze the hydrogenation of imines to form N-alkyl amines [27]. Although the use of PdNPs@MIL-100(Fe) for the N-alkylation reactions is attractive since the reactions can be realized under visible light irradiations, the yield to the targeted products over Pd@MIL-100(Fe) for some N-alkylation reactions are still not satisfactory. Kinetic studies on the reaction between benzyl alcohol and aniline over PdNPs@MIL-100(Fe) under visible light revealed that the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde is the rate-limiting step for the whole N-alkylation reaction. This finding points out a strategy to improve the whole N-alkylation reaction by accelerating the alcohol-to-aldehyde transformation, the rate-limiting step in the tandem reaction. Considering that photocatalysis has become important for homogeneous gold catalysis and metallic AuNPs are active catalysts for abstracting hydrogen from alcohols to form aldehydes [43–54], we proposed that the introduction of metallic Au into Pd@MIL-100(Fe) would promote the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of alcohols, which in turn would result in an improved efficiency for the whole tandem reaction to yield N-alkyl amines. In addition, it is preferred that the resultant Au-H species by abstracting hydrogen from the alcohols should be recovered by hydrogen transfer to Pd sites to form Pd-H, which acts as the active species for the hydrogenation of the imines. To facilitate the hydrogen transfer from Au to Pd, Au and Pd should be in close proximity. In this manuscript, we reported the preparation of small bimetallic PdAu alloy NPs encapsulated inside the cavities of MIL-100(Fe) (PdAu@MIL-100(Fe)) via a double-solvent impregnation followed by a photoreduction method, and their application in tandem reactions between amines and alcohols to realize the N-alkylation under visible light irradiation. As compared with bare Pd NPs encapsulated inside MIL-100(Fe), the as-formed bimetallic PdAu@MIL-100(Fe) showed superior performance for the generations of desired N-alkyl amines. In addition, the Pd/Au ratio in PdAu@MIL-100(Fe) influences its catalytic performance for N-alkylation reaction. The comparison of the catalytic performance of PdAu@MIL-100(Fe) with different Pd/Au ratio indicates that the reaction rates of two consecutive steps in the N-alkylation reaction, i.e., photocatalytic dehydrogenation of alcohols and hydrogenation of imines, can be tuned by changing the Pd/Au ratio. This study not only provides an efficient way to realize a highly efficient and stable alkylation of amines via a successful coupling of the MOF-based photocatalysis and MNPs-based hydrogenation, but also demonstrates that in a cascade/tandem reaction, the reaction rates of different catalytic steps can be tuned for an efficient cascade/tandem reaction via a rational design of the multifunctional catalyst."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparations,"2.1 Preparations All the reagents were commercial available and used without further purifications. MIL-100(Fe) was prepared following previously reported procedures with slight modifications [55]. Pd@MIL-100(Fe) was prepared by a double-solvent impregnation approach combined with a photoreduction process as reported previously [27,56]. Bimetallic PdAu@MIL-100(Fe) with a fixed total noble metal doping of 1.0 wt%, but different Pd/Au ratio (denoted as PdxAuy@MIL-100(Fe)), were prepared in similar procedures as those in the preparation of Pd@MIL-100(Fe), except that different ratio of HAuCl4 and PdCl2(CH3CN)2 were used instead of bare PdCl2(CH3CN)2. Take 1.0 wt% Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe) for example, MIL-100(Fe) was activated at 120 °C under vacuum to remove the residual solvent in the pores. 100 mg of activated MIL-100(Fe) was suspended in 20 mL of hydrophobic anhydrous n-hexane. The as-obtained suspension was sonicated for 1 h before a hydrophilic solution (0.08 mL) containing PdCl2(CH3CN)2 (1.3 mg, 0.5 wt% Pd) and HAuCl4·4H2O (1.1 mg, 0.5 wt% Au) was added drop-wise into the above suspension under vigorous stirring. After stirring for 2 h, the solid was isolated, washed with ethanol and dried under vacuum. The as-obtained solid was suspended in degassed anhydrous methanol and irradiated under visible light for 3 h. The resultant solid product was filtered, washed with methanol and dried overnight at 60 °C in oven."
3,Characterizations,"2.2 Characterizations X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (Bruker, Germany) with Cu Kα radiation. The accelerating voltage and the applied current were 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. Data were recorded at a scanning rate of 0.02° 2θ s−1 in the 2θ range of 5° to 30°. UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-DRS) of the powders were obtained with BaSO4 used as a reflectance standard. BET surface area was carried out on an ASAP 2020M apparatus (Micromeritics Instrument Corp., USA). The samples were degassed in vacuum at 150 °C for 10 h and then measured at −196 °C. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained on a JEOL model JEM 2010 EX instrument. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a PHI Quantum 2000 XPS system (PHI, USA). Inductively Coupled Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES) was performed on Optima 8000 (PerkinElmer). Before ICP-OES experiment, the solid sample was digested in mixture of HNO3 and milli-Q water."
4,Catalytic reactions,"2.3 Catalytic reactions The N-alkylation reactions were performed in a sealed schlenk tube under visible light irradiation. The catalyst (10 mg), amines (0.1 mmol) and alcohols (3 mmol) were suspended in CH3CN (2 mL) and the resultant mixture were degassed and saturated with N2 to remove any dissolved O2 before reaction. The reactions were performed under the irradiation of a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a UV-cut filter to remove irradiation with wavelengths less than 420 nm and an IR-cut filter to remove irradiation with wavelengths >800 nm. After reaction, the reaction mixture was filtered through a porous membrane (20 μm in diameter) and the products were analyzed by GC–MS and GC-FID (Shimadzu GC-2014) equipped with a HP-5 capillary column. Photocatalytic dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol was conducted in a sealed reaction tube containing catalyst (10 mg), benzyl alcohol (0.1 mmol) and CH3CN (2 mL). The reaction between aniline and benzaldehyde was carried out in a tube containing catalyst (10 mg), aniline (0.1 mmol), benzaldehyde (0.5 mmol) and CH3CN (2 mL). Hydrogenation of N-benzylideneaniline with H2 was carried out in a reaction tube containing catalyst (10 mg), N-benzylideneaniline (0.1 mmol), benzyl alcohol (3 mmol) and CH3CN (2 mL)."
5,Results and discussion,"MIL-100(Fe) was prepared from the Fe(NO3)3 and H3BTC following the reported method [55]. The as-obtained product shows similar XRD patterns and comparable surface area (2021 m2/g) to those reported previously, confirming the formation of MIL-100(Fe) with high quality (Fig. 1 a and S1a). Bimetallic PdAu NPs with different Pd/Au ratio encapsulated inside the cavities of MIL-100(Fe) were prepared via a double-solvent impregnation of MIL-100(Fe) with both Pd and Au precursors, followed by a photoreduction approach. The XRD patterns of all the as-obtained products show similar diffraction patterns as that of bare MIL-100(Fe), indicating that the integrity of the MIL-100(Fe) frameworks were maintained during the impregnation and the following photo-reduction process (Fig. 1). No characteristic diffraction peaks corresponding to either metallic Pd or Au or their oxides were observed, probably due to the low loading amount and their homogeneous dispersion in the samples. However, the XPS spectra confirm the presence of both metallic Pd and Au in the samples. The XPS spectrum of Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe) shows two peaks at binding energy of 336.07 and 341.37 eV, assignable to Pd0 3d5/2 and Pd0 3d3/2, as well as 83.70 and 87.40 eV, attributable to Au0 4f7/2 and 4f5/2, respectively (Fig. 2 ) [57,58]. As compared with those in Pd@MIL-100(Fe) (335.40 and 340.70 eV for Pd 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 respectively), the binding energies of Pd in Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe) show a 0.67 eV shift toward higher binding energy. In the meantime, Au 4f peaks in Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe) shift to lower binding energies by 0.13 eV as compared with those observed in Au@MIL-100(Fe) (83.83 and 87.53 eV for Au 4f7/2 and 4f5/2, respectively). The shifts in binding energies for both Pd and Au, but in different direction, suggest the existence of strong interaction between Pd and Au in the Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe) [59,60]. The successful incorporation of bimetallic PdAu NPs inside the cavities of MIL-100(Fe) was also evidenced by the TEM images (Fig. 3 ). As shown in Fig. 3a, the as-formed Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe) shows octahedral shape with smooth surface, indicating that the metallic NPs are encapsulated inside the cavities. The HRTEM image shows an even distribution of NPs with uniform size of ca. 1.7 nm in the interior cavities of MIL-100(Fe) (Fig. 3b and S2). Elemental mapping of Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe) shows a homogeneous distribution of Pd and Au (Fig. 3c and d). The line profile of the energy dispersion X-ray (EDX) spectrum of a typical PdAu NPs shows that it consists of both Au and Pd distributed spherically, indicating that Pd and Au exists as binary alloy NPs in Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe) (Fig. 3e and f). All these characterizations suggest that small sized PdAu alloy NPs encapsulated inside the cavities of MIL-100(Fe) have been successfully obtained. It is obvious that the cavities in MIL-100(Fe) provide a unique environment for the confined growth of small metal NPs since it is generally known that small sized metallic NPs are usually difficult to obtain due to their high surface energy [15–18,61]. The amount of the encapsulated Pd and Au in Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe) was determined to be 0.51 and 0.48 wt%, respectively, identical to that in the precursors. The encapsulation of metallic PdAu alloy NPs inside the cavities of MIL-100(Fe) lead to a decrease of the specific surface area from the original 2021 m2/g for MIL-100(Fe) to 1571 m2/g for Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe) (Fig. S1b). The UV–vis DRS of Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe) shows similar profiles as that of pristine MIL-100(Fe), suggesting that the presence of PdAu alloy NPs has negligible effect on the light absorption of MIL-100(Fe) (Fig. 4 ) [62–64]. Our previous studies revealed that light-induced N-alkylation of amines with alcohols can be realized over Pd@MIL-100(Fe) via a tandem photocatalytic dehydrogenation/condensation/hydrogenation process [27]. To study the influence of the introduced metallic Au on the catalytic performance of Pd@MIL-100(Fe) for the N-alkylation reaction, Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe) was first chosen as the catalyst for the reaction between aniline (1a) and benzyl alcohol (2a) as a model reaction under visible light in CH3CN (Table 1 ). Similar to that observed over Pd@MIL-100(Fe), the reaction between 1a and 2a over irradiated Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe) also led to the formation of the desired product N-benzylaniline (3a), with the intermediates N-benzylideneaniline (3b) and benzaldehyde as the byproducts. After irradiated for 24 h, 1a was quantitatively transformed (>99%), with a high yield of 93% to the desired 3a (entry 1). On the contrary, no reaction occurs in absence of either Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe) or visible light (entry 2 and 3). The filtrate reaction revealed that no further reaction occurred after Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe) was removed from the reaction system (entry 4). All these demonstrated that the N-alkylation of aniline with benzyl alcohol is truly induced by irradiated Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe). Both the 1a conversion and the yield to desired 3a are higher over Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe), since only 88% of 1a was converted and a yield of 76% to 3a was realized over 1.0 wt% Pd@MIL-100(Fe) under otherwise similar condition (entry 5). Such a result indicates that the introduction of metallic Au to form PdAu alloy NPs can promote the light induced N-alkylation reaction. To study how the Pd/Au ratio influences the catalytic activity, three other catalysts with similar mass amount of noble metals (1.0 wt%) but different Pd/Au ratio, i.e., Pd2Au1@MIL-100(Fe), Pd1Au2@MIL-100(Fe) and Au@MIL-100(Fe), were also used in the N-alkylation reaction. It was found that all Au containing catalysts show higher 1a conversion as compared with Pd@MIL-100(Fe), with the conversion of 1a over Pd2Au1@MIL-100(Fe), Pd1Au2@MIL-100(Fe) and Au@MIL-100(Fe) to be 95%, >99% and 91%, respectively (entry 6–8). In the meantime, the amount of benzaldehyde in the reaction systems, the photocatalytic dehydrogenation product of benzyl alcohol (benzaldehyde), decreases in the order of Au@MIL-100(Fe) (51 μmol) > Pd1Au2@MIL-100(Fe) (41 μmol) > Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe) (40 μmol) > Pd2Au1@MIL-100(Fe) (37 μmol), implying that higher amount of Au in the PdAu alloy is beneficial for photocatalytic dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol to form benzaldehyde. This is in consistence with our assumption that the introduction of metallic Au into the catalytic system would promote the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol. However, an optimized performance of the whole tandem N-alkylation reaction, i.e., the yield to the desired product 3a (93%), was realized over Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe) (entry 1). Moreover, even with the highest activity for dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol, Au@MIL-100(Fe) showed the lowest activity for the production of the desired product 3a (70%) among all the investigated catalysts (entry 8). It is therefore assumed that the lower catalytic efficiency for the whole N-alkylation reaction over Au@MIL-100(Fe) is limited by the low reaction rate in the catalytic hydrogenation of imines to form N-alkyl amines, in which Pd plays an important role [27,40]. Since the tandem reaction between aniline and benzyl alcohol to form 3a over irradiated M@MIL-100(Fe) proceeds via three consecutive steps: dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol to form benzaldehyde, condensation between benzaldehyde and aniline to produce 3b and hydrogenation of 3b to generate 3a [27,65], the three processes were investigated separately over Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe) and were compared with those over Pd@MIL-100(Fe) under similar conditions. For the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol, 30% of benzyl alcohol was converted to benzaldehyde in 12 h over Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe), while only 23% of benzyl alcohol was converted over Pd@MIL-100(Fe) under otherwise similar conditions. A similar promoting effect of metallic Au NPs in the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of alcohols was previously reported over other Au modified Pd-based catalysts [66]. The condensation of aniline and benzaldehyde gave an almost quantitative transformation of aniline to 3b over both Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe) and Pd@MIL-100(Fe). On the contrary, the activity of hydrogenation of 3b with H2 to produce 3a was higher over Pd@MIL-100(Fe) (93%) than that over Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe) (91%). These controlled experiments again confirm that Au plays a promoting role for the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohols, while metallic Pd is a better catalyst than metallic Au in hydrogenation of imines to generate N-alkyl amines. In addition, the observation of the Pd/Au ratio dependent N-alkylation performance over these PdAu@MIL-100(Fe) suggests that it is feasible to tune the reaction rates of benzyl alcohols dehydrogenation and hydrogenation of imines simultaneously via changing the Pd/Au ratio to realize an efficient N-alkylation reaction. It is generally known that the fine tuning of the reaction rates of different catalytic steps is important to achieve an efficient tandem/cascade reaction, but it is very challenging. Based on the above observations and analyses, we proposed that the improved performance in the N-alkylation reaction over PdAu@MIL-100(Fe) is due to an synergistic promoting effect of metallic Au on the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol to form benzaldehyde. When Au is introduced into MIL-100(Fe) to form PdAu alloy NPs encapsulated inside the cavities of MIL-100(Fe), the photogenerated electrons are transferred to PdAu NPs to form electron rich metallic sites. Au sites in PdAu alloy NPs act as active sites for abstracting hydrogen from benzyl alcohol to form Au-H and produce benzaldehyde. Due to the strong interaction between Au and Pd in PdAu alloy NPs as well as the strong affinity of hydrogen to metallic Pd, hydrogen transfer from Au sites to Pd to form Pd-H species, which is more active for the hydrogenation of 3b to form 3a than Au-H. That is why pure Au@MIL-100(Fe) shows a poorer performance for the whole N-alkylation reaction even it exhibits the best performance for dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol. An optimized Pd/Au ratio is to ensure that the rates of the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol and the hydrogenation of 3b to form the desired 3a synchronized to realize an efficient tandem N-alkylation reaction between benzyl alcohol and aniline. The tandem reactions between amines and alcohols to produce N-alkyl amines over visible light irradiated Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe) can also be expanded to a wide range of substrates. As shown in Table 1, all the aromatic amines with different substituents can react with benzyl alcohol to give the corresponding N-alkyl amines over irradiated Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe) although with different activities. Compared with bare aniline, anilines with electron-withdrawing substituents like –Cl and –NO2 showed significantly decreased conversion ratio (20–26%) and lower yield to N-alky amines (8–18%) (entry 9, 10), while those with electron-donating groups like p-OCH3 and p-CH3 exhibited increased conversion ratio (>99%) and a high yield to target products (90–95%) (entry 11, 12). Benzyl alcohols with different substituted groups also reacted with aniline to produce N-alkyl amines over irradiated Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe), with medium to high conversion ratio of aniline (87%–>99%) and reasonable yield to N-alkyl amines (60–90%) after irradiated for 24 h, except for p-nitrobenzyl alcohol which exhibited a lower aniline conversion of 18% (entry 13–17). Both ortho- and meta- substituted benzyl alcohol showed lower activity (87%–92%) than those with para-substituted substrates (≥98%). The lower activity of meta-substituted benzyl alcohol can be ascribed to steric effect, while the inferior conversion of ortho-substituted benzyl alcohol is probably a consequence of both the electronic and steric effects. In addition to aromatic amines and alcohols, the scope of the substrates can also be expanded to aliphatic amines and alcohols (entry 18–21). Either the reactions of aliphatic amines with benzyl alcohols or those between anilines and aliphatic alcohols occurred over the Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe), but with a lower conversion ratio (19–57%) and lower yield (11–43%) to their respective N-alkyl amines. However, for all the investigated N-alkylation reactions, both the amines conversions and the yields to desired N-alkyl amines are higher over Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe) as compared with those over bare Pd@MIL-100(Fe), suggesting the existence of promoting effect of metallic Au for all the N-alkylation reactions. In addition to the enhanced catalytic performance, Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe) also showed high stability for the light-induced N-alkylation reaction. No obvious loss of the activity was observed for Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe) after four cycling tests (Fig. 5 ). ICP analysis of the filtrate revealed no detectable Pd, Au and Fe. The Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe) after four runs showed similar XRD patterns and still exhibited a relative high specific surface area of 1384 m2 g−1 as compared with the fresh one (1571 m2 g−1) (Fig. S3-4). In addition, the TEM image of the used catalyst shows that PdAu alloy NPs with almost similar size distribution were still maintained (Fig. S5). All these indicate that Pd1Au1@MIL-100(Fe) are highly efficient and stable catalyst for the light-induced tandem reaction between amines and alcohols to produce N-alkyl amines."
6,Conclusions,"In summary, PdAu@MIL-100(Fe), with bimetallic PdAu alloy NPs encapsulated inside the cavities of MIL-100(Fe), were prepared via a double-solvent impregnation followed by a photoreduction method. As compared with bare Pd@MIL-100(Fe), bimetallic PdAu@MIL-100(Fe) show superior activity for the tandem reaction between amines and alcohols to produce N-alkyl amines under visible light irradiation, ascribed to the promoting effect of metallic Au in the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of alcohols. The Pd/Au ratio dependent catalytic activity also indicates that the reaction rates of two consecutive steps in the tandem reaction between alcohols and amines to produce N-alkyl amines, i.e., dehydrogenation of alcohols and hydrogenation of imines, can be tuned by changing the Pd/Au ratio. This study provides an efficient way to realize a highly efficient and stable alkylation of amines via a successful coupling of the MOF-based photocatalysis and metal NPs-based hydrogenation. In addition, this work demonstrates that the reaction rates of different catalytic steps in a cascade/tandem reaction can be tuned for an efficient whole reaction via a rational design of the multifunctional catalyst."
