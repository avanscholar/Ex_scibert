0,Introduction,"The decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen by sunlight is a zero‑carbon emission process that conforms to the requirements of the development of human society for green environmental protection and energy regeneration [1–4]. Therefore, researchers have been focussing to find a suitable catalyst with high luminous activity and good light stability, to obtain inexhaustible solar energy and replace fossil energy resources [5–7]. Graphite carbonitride (g-C3N4) is a flexible and layered structure semi-conducting material. This material has a high visible light absorption capacity and narrow bandgap (~2.8 eV) [8–10] and can serve as a photocatalyst for water decomposition to generate hydrogen. g-C3N4 is different from other metal-based photocatalysts due to its practical application value in energy and environment. The reason behind this is its high chemical stability, reasonable band position, and low cost [11,12]. However, g-C3N4 has rapid photoinduced electron-hole (e−/h+) recombination during photocatalytic reaction which reduces its overall catalytic activity. Considerable efforts have been exerted to overcome this disadvantage. For example, g-C3N4 heterojunction composites are combined with other semiconductors to enhance the light absorption, inhibit e−/h+ recombination, and increase the photocatalytic activity [13–15]. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been widely used as a photocatalyst because of its feasible reduction potential, good chemical stability, and environmental friendliness [16,17]. However, this material has limited practical applications in solar absorption due to its less than 5% response for ultraviolet sunlight, owing to its inherent large bandgap (~3.2 eV) and has low charge separation [18–20]. An electric field establishes at the heterojunction of g-C3N4 and TiO2, which can easily transfer the electrons and holes in the opposite direction, and thus inhibit the rapid recombination rate of e−/h+ of g-C3N4. In addition, their complementary materials can be doped to form a composite structure with lower adverse composite [21,22]. Constructing heterojunctions of g-C3N4 and TiO2 with different optical responses activates the composite in the ultraviolet and visible light, and effectively inhibits the e−/h+ rapid recombination. It is already reported that the composite of two components cannot be of high-performance catalytic composites. The local surface plasmonic resonance (LSPR) effect of precious metals such as Gold (Au) nanoparticles can also be used as an electron trap centre to assist the charge separation and further sensitize TiO2 in the visible light [23,24]. Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are typical quasi-spherical nanoparticles with strong visible light absorption and conversion photoluminescence (PL) characteristics. They are composed of amorphous to nanocrystalline nuclei, mainly graphitized carbon (sp2 carbon) or graphene and graphene oxide sheets or formed by the fusion of diamond-like carbon (sp 3 hybrid carbon) [25,26]. Their conjugate structure has the property of electron transfer/energy storage; hence, it can effectively utilize the full spectrum [27,28]. Therefore, research on CQDs for the photocatalysis has attracted many researchers and obtained many achievements. For example, CQDs have been successfully introduced into semiconductors, such as TiO2 [29–31], g-C3N4 [32], Fe2O3 [33], Ag3PO4 [34] and BiOX (X: Cl, Br, I) [35–38], to improve their photocatalytic performance. In this paper, we propose a material design approach that facilitates the separation of e−/h+ pairs, using a junction in a noble metal-CQDs-semiconductor stack structure as a special nanostructure. This design aims to balance charge separation, increase response spectral area, and improve the catalytic stability. However, the noble metal-CQDs-semiconductor stack is a complicated catalyst with an inefficient synthetic process. In this work, the g-C3N4/TiO2/NH4TiOF3 coupling is designed and realized by a simple one-step hydrothermal method, followed by complete hydrothermal hydrolysis of NH4TiOF3, to obtain TiO2. Meanwhile, Au nanoparticles and CQDs composite were completed, and the Z-scheme heterojunction nanocomposites with excellent photoelectric properties are synthesized in two simple steps. In order to reduce the disadvantages of g-C3N4, it was composite with TiO2 and designed a nano-catalyst (heterogeneous structures) that inhibit the e−/h+ pairs recombination. Au is used as sensitizers and electron transport agents, while CQDs are employed to enhance the visible light absorption and conversion of photoluminescence characteristics. The g-C3N4/TiO2/CQDs/Au quaternary composite exhibits outstanding performance for the photoreduction of water and produce hydrogen."
1,Experiment section,
2,Preparation of catalyst,"2.1 Preparation of catalyst A typical method is used to prepare g-C3N4, where 10 g of urea is placed in a 30 mL alumina crucible, covered with aluminium foil, and kept warm for 4 h at 550 °C in muff furnace. The heating rate was 10 °C/min. g-C3N4 was obtained by natural cooling. The prepared g-C3N4 (0.2 g) was grounded with agate for 30 min to obtain a g-C3N4 powder. The g-C3N4 powder was dispersed into 35 mL of isopropanol and then peeled for 4 h in a 300 W ultrasonic cleaning instrument to obtain single-chip g-C3N4. The pale-yellow mixture of g-C3N4 and isopropyl alcohol was added with 1.4 mL of tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT) and 0.5 mL of hydrofluoric acid (HF), and mixed for 30 min. The mixture was transferred into a 50 mL PTFE lined stainless steel autoclave and autoclaved at 180 °C. The oven heat was preserved for 12 h and the sample was filtered, then repeatedly washed with ethanol and deionized water and finally vacuum dried at 80 °C for 24 h to obtain g-C3N4/TiO2/NH4TiOF3 samples. A 0.1 g sample of the prepared g-C3N4/TiO2/NH4TiOF3 was dispersed in 35 mL of 2% glucose aqueous solution. The mixture was ultrasonically dispersed for 30 min. After this, different amounts of 25 mmol/L aqueous solution of tetrachloroacid (HAuCl4) were added dropwise and then stirred for 30 min. The mixture was transferred into a 50 mL stainless steel autoclave lined with polytetrafluoroethylene and then stored in an oven at 90 °C for 4 h. The catalyst g-C3N4/TiO2/CQDs/Au series samples were obtained by filtration and repeatedly many times washed with deionized water. Finally, the sample dried in vacuum at 80 °C for 24 h. The photocatalyst was named as gCN/TO/CQDs/Au-X (X = 1, 2, 3, 4) according to different amounts of HAuCl4 (0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 mL). According to the same steps as above-mentioned, a 0.1 g sample of the prepared g-C3N4/TiO2/NH4TiOF3 was dispersed in 35 mL pure water, and the catalyst was labelled as gCN/TO. A 0.1 g sample of the prepared g-C3N4 and g-C3N4/TiO2/NH4TiOF3 were dispersed in 35 mL of 2% glucose aqueous solution, and the catalyst were labelled as gCN/CQDs and gCN/TO/CQDs, respectively. The preparation process of the catalyst is schematically shown in Fig. 1 ."
3,Analysis methods and photocatalytic activity,"2.2 Analysis methods and photocatalytic activity The phase composition of the sample was determined from X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis (D/max2550pc, pigakv Co., Ltd.), where cu-k α radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) is used. The scanning step was determined as 0.02 and ranged from 10° to 80°. The surface morphology and chemical element distribution of the catalyst were characterized using spherical aberration correction-transmission electron microscopy (Titan G2 60-300, FEI, USA) and energy spectrum elemental mapping. The chemical composition and bonding energy of the powder were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS, K-ALPHA, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The electrochemical analysis was carried out on a CHI660C electrochemical workstation (Chenhua Instrument, Shanghai, China) with a three-electrode electrochemical cell. The effective area of the sample was kept 1.0 cm2 as a working electrode, platinum wire as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and 0.5 M Na2SO4 (pH 7) solution as electrolyte. The emission intensity of sample (fluorescence EX WL320 nm, EM Start WL 350 nm, EM end WL 600 nm, EX Slit 1.0 nm, EM Slit 2.5 nm) was tested on a fluorescence spectrophotometer (f7000, Hitachi, Japan). The UV–visible spectrum was obtained from UV–visible near-infrared spectrophotometer (Cary 5000, Agilent Technologies (Malaysia)) where the scanning wavelength was 300–800 nm. The photocatalytic activity was tested in a photocatalytic reactor (LABSOLAR-H2, Beijing Perfect Technology Co., Ltd., China). The photocatalyst (13.5 mg) was dispersed into 80 mL of triethanolamine (TEOA) aqueous solution (10% by volume of TEOA in the solution), and then 0.08 mL of H2PtCl6 aqueous solution (25 mmol/L) was added. TEOA was used as a hole trapping agent, and H2PtCl6 was used as a co-catalyst through Pt photodeposition. Finally, ultrasonic dispersion was carried out for 30 min, and vacuuming was carried out to maintain a considerable positive void to avoid the test error, caused by the gas in the liquid. Under 300 W xenon lamp, the temperature was maintained to 5 °C, and the escaping gas was recorded and analyzed from a gas chromatograph."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Structural and morphological characteristics,"3.1 Structural and morphological characteristics The X-ray diffraction patterns of the prepared photocatalyst such as g-C3N4, g-C3N4/TiO2/NH4TiOF3, and the photocatalyst with different Au contents are given in Fig. 2 . Analysis of the data of Fig. 2 shows no trace impurities for all samples. The weak band peak of g-C3N4 at 13.1° corresponds to the (100) plane, and a characteristic peak at 27.6° is attributed to the (002) carbon plane [39]. The composites generated by the reactions of g-C3N4, TBOT, and HF had characteristic band peaks for g-C3N4, TiO2, and NH4TiOF3, respectively. The characteristic absorption band peaks of NH4TiOF3 are located at 13.7°, 23.6°, 27.5°, 33.8°, and 41.9°, which are attributed to the corresponding crystal surfaces of NH4TiOF3 (002), (020), (211), (220) and (025). This result is also consistent with the already reported data [40]. Subsequently, NH4TiOF3 is hydrolated into anatase TiO2 and found that the diffraction characteristic peaks of NH4TiOF3 vanish. Meanwhile, the diffraction characteristic peaks of TiO2 were enhanced which correspond to 25.3°, 37.8°, 48.0°, 55.0°, and 62.7°. These band peaks are attributed to the crystal surfaces of anatase TiO2 (101), (004), (200), (211), and (204). In this process, it is found that with the increase in Au content, the X-ray diffraction signal of Au enhances, and the diffraction peaks at 38.2° and 44.4° can be assigned to Au (111) and Au (200) planes, respectively. However, no obvious XRD signal for CQDs is observed. The possible reason might be the too much smaller particle size of CQDs and its even dispersion in the composite material. TEM, HRTEM, STEM, and energy spectrum analyses of the investigated sample such as gCN/TO/CQDs/Au-3 are shown (Fig. 3 ). The g-C3N4 nanometre sheet was loaded on TiO2 nanoparticles, and the Au and CQDs nanoparticles were evenly distributed. In this work, we used a porous shaped TiO2, the Au nanoparticles have a diameter of 1–5 nm while the size distribution of CQDs was 1–3 nm (Fig. 3a). From (Fig. 3b), a d = 0.35 nm lattice stripe indicates the presence of TiO2 (101). The interface between g-C3N4 and TiO2 was very close, and the high-quality interface contact can significantly improve the photogenerated charge transfer and the overall efficiency of charge separation. The HRTEM at d = 0.235 nm and d = 0.218 nm (Fig. 3c) can be attributed to the (101) CQDs [41,42] and (100) Au [24], respectively. As illustrated (Fig. 3d) and local HDDF-STEM (Fig. 3d1 insert), the bright spots of gold nanoparticles were evenly dispersed on the composite material. The elemental distribution of Au, C, N, O, and Ti are shown in Fig. 3e–j. From these results, we found that the material is rich in C, N, O, and Ti, where the Au nanoparticles are evenly dispersed. The composite is composed of g-C3N4 nanosheet, TiO2 nanoparticles, Au nanoparticles, and CQDs. TiO2 nanoparticles, Au nanoparticles, and CQDs were stacked on g-C3N4 nanometre sheets. The analysis of XPS spectra reveals that only C, N, Ti, O, and Au exist in gCN/TO/CQDs/Au-3 (Fig. 4a). Three peaks such as 284.8, 288.0, and 286.2 eV are appeared in the C 1s spectrum of g-C3N4 and gCN/TO/CQDs/Au-3 (Fig. 4b), which correspond to the indeterminable hydrocarbon, CO peak and SP3 CN bond [37,43,44]. Notably, the increase in CO content in the composites roots in the introduction of hydroxy-rich CQDs. The N 1 s XPS spectrum of g-C3N4 (Fig. 4c) is divided into four peaks such as 398.5, 399.6, 400.3 and 404.2 eV, which were assigned as C-N=C, tertiary nitrogen (N-(C)3), amino-functional groups (N-Hx) and π excitation [45,46], respectively. In the N 1s spectrum of gCN/TO/CQDs/Au-3, the N peak migrates to 400.8 eV, which is attributed to Ti-ON. The presence of TiO2 nanoparticles changes the electron cloud density of nitrogen, which also indicates that TiO2 and g-C3N4 not simply undergo physical accumulation but are closely related and interacting [47]. The high-resolution spectra of Ti 2p (Fig. 4d) showed two peaks at 458.6 and 464.3 eV, which correspond to the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 of TiO2, respectively. The bimodal separation at 5.7 eV is characteristic of anatase TiO2 [48,49]. The O 1s peaks of 529.9, 531.0, 531.7 and 533.0 eV at high-resolution spectra O 1s of gCN/TO/CQDs/Au-3 (Fig. 4e) are attributed to TiO (lattice oxygen of anatase TiO2), Ti-ON or CO, CO and adsorbed water or -OH, respectively [50]. The O 1s peak of CO and -OH are related the involvement of CQDs rich in C-OH. The peaks at 84.6 eV and 87.9 eV (Fig. 4f) are correspond to Au4f 7/2 and Au4f 5/2 [51], respectively."
6,Photoelectric performance,"3.2 Photoelectric performance The PL spectrum is generated by charge-carrier recombination, which is helpful to understand the behaviour of electrons and holes during separation and recombination in a photocatalytic process (Fig. 5a). From these figures, we found that the emission intensity decreased from pure g-C3N4 to g-C3N4/TiO2/NH4TiOF3, and then the PL of composite samples were quenched for the series composites of gCN/TO/CQDs/Au-X. This indicates that the photoinduced e−/h+ pairs of composite was effectively inhibited. The PL emission intensity significantly reduced when NH4TiOF3 was completely converted into TiO2, indicating that g-C3N4/TiO2 heterojunction has separated the e−/h+ pairs by inhibiting its recombination. Consequently, more electrons can participate in the photodecomposition of water reaction and improve the overall catalytic activity. The ultraviolet-visible absorption spectrum of the samples (Fig. 5b) shows that: the catalytic performance of g-C3N4/TiO2/NH4TiOF3 is better than that of the pure g-C3N4。The reason behind this is the formation of a heterostructure between g-C3N4 and TiO2, which inhibits the e−/h+ recombination. Similarly, a local electric field is formed between the interface of TiO2 and NH4TiOF3, which enhances the charge transfer [52]. The absorption is significantly enhanced along with the introduction and increase amount of Au content, from gCN/TO/CQDs/Au-1 to gCN/TO/CQDs/Au-4. The LSPR effect of Au nanoparticles has effectively enhanced the visible absorption of the resulted composite. The peak at 500–700 nm is attributed to the conversion PL characteristics of CQDs. Anatase TiO2 has a wide bandgap of 3.2 eV while that of g-C3N4 is estimated to be about 2.8 eV. Our observed band gap values for TiO2 and g-C3N4 are also consistent with the already reported work [20,42]. The bandgap width of the composite material is 2.9–3.0 eV (Fig. 5c). The adsorption edge of g-C3N4 is about 450 nm, and that of TiO2 is 390 nm. Therefore, the light between 390 and 450 nm cannot be used by TiO2 but can be effectively utilized by g-C3N4. The overlap of light capture produces a strong light reabsorption effect (the light is reused by g-C3N4), leading to the emergence of an absorption platform. With the introduction of Au nanoparticles and CQDs, this platform has been extended for the composite to perform well in the ultraviolet and visible wavelengths, thus maximize and improve the utilization of solar energy."
7,Photocatalytic performance,"3.3 Photocatalytic performance The effects of heterojunction (composite materials), the introduction of Au nanoparticles, and CQDs toward the photocatalytic hydrogen production of samples are verified. Different samples have produced a different rate of hydrogen as shown in Fig. 6 a and b. The catalytic hydrogen production ability of different samples was tested under the simulated sunlight of 300 W xenon lamp. For the comparative analysis, first, pure g-C3N4 and then processed samples such as g-C3N4/TiO2/NH4TiOF3 were tested under the same conditions. It is found that the rate of hydrogen production for g-C3N4 was 0.906 mmol/g/h, showing a low hydrogen production rate. This lower performance is due to the rapid recombination of e−/h+ pairs in g-C3N4. The hydrogen production rate of g-C3N4/TiO2/NH4TiOF3 is 3.50 mmol/g/h, which is 3.8 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4.This enhancement is because of two reasons: firstly, the successful construction of g-C3N4 and TiO2 heterojunction which inhibits the rapid recombination of e−/h+ pairs. Secondly, the local build-in electric field, induced by the non-uniform distribution of charge across the NH4TiOF3/TiO2 interface which facilitates the charge transport [52]. The hydrogen production rate of g-C3N4/CQDs, g-C3N4/TiO2 and g-C3N4/TiO2/CQDs are 1.79 mmol/g/h, 2.88 mmol/g/h, and 3.41 mmol/g/h, which are higher than that of pristine g-C3N4. This is due to the introduction of CQDs and the formation of heterogeneous structures. The introduction of CQDs and the deposition of different amounts of Au nanoparticles have significantly improved the hydrogen production rate. The rate of hydrogen production for gCN/TO/CQDs/Au-3 reached to a maximum of 5.69 mmol/g/h, which is 6.2 times that of pure g-C3N4. The reasons behind this are summarised as follows. First, the construction of heterojunction and the introduction of a high-quality interface between TiO2 and g-C3N4 are confirmed from the results of TEM and PL. This heterojunction has effectively prevented the rapid recombination of e−/h+ pairs (g-C3N4) and realized efficient charge separation and transmission. Secondly, the introduction of Au nanoparticles and the emergence of CQDs greatly enhanced the absorption and utilization of the visible part of the sunlight, which is observed in the UV–visible spectrum. The catalytic hydrogen production rate decreased to 4.83 mmol/g/h with the continuous increment of Au content. This is due to the growth and agglomeration of gold nanoparticles which consequently decrease the catalytic performance. In addition, the composite material with high catalytic activity should have excellent stability, to be used for the practical applications of photocatalysis. So, a repeatable and stable cycle test is necessary. After 5 cycles of experiments, no significant decrease in the hydrogen production rate is found for the composite material gCN/TO/CQDs/Au-3 (Fig. 6c), which confirmed its excellent stability. After 5 h, the cumulative hydrogen production reached 28 mmol/g. This result shows an overwhelming advantage compared to that of similar types of composites. The comparative analysis of XRD (Fig. 7a) and XPS (Fig. 7b–e) shows that the catalyst holds original integrity and consistency of crystal structure after several rounds of cyclic testing. At the same time, the binding energy shows a slight fluctuation. Taken together, above-mentioned evidences are responsible for the catalytic stability of hydrogen production. However, it is worth noting that Au binding energy is significantly shifted (Fig. 7f), which is due to the involvement of triethanolamine in the catalytic process to activate the surface properties of Au nanoparticles."
8,Reaction and catalytic mechanism,"3.4 Reaction and catalytic mechanism The following equation is used to describe the whole reaction process: (1) g − C 3 N 4 + 12 HF + 4Ti − OR 4 + 4H 2 O = 4NH 4 TiOF 3 ↓ + 3C − OR 4 + 4R − OH (2) NH 4 TiOF 3 + H 2 O = TiO 2 ↓ + NH 3 ↑ + 3HF (3) 2HAuCl 4 · 4H 2 O + 3R ′ − CHO → 2Au ↓ + 3R ′ − COOH + 8HCl + 5H 2 O R = − C 4 H 9 , R ′ = − CHOH 4 CH 2 OH . In the first step of hydrothermal reaction, g-C3N4, TBOT, and HF reactions g-C3N4 react to generate NH4TiOF3 and excess g-C3N4, part of NH4TiOF3 is further hydrolyzed into TiO2 to form NH4TiOF3, g-C3N4, and TiO2 composite materials. This is further verified by the XRD diagram of g-C3N4/TiO2/NH4TiOF3. This whole process is described by reactions (1) and (2). Supplementary experiments and literature research are designed to verify the scientific nature of the inference and determined the source of TiO2. Only TBOT and HF were added into the reaction system, and no TiO2 samples were collected. This confirms that TiO2 does not come from the hydrolysis of TBOT. The reason behind this is the lower amount of TBOT which cannot provide sufficient concentration for Ti4+ dissociation. This statement is also consistent with the already reported work [53]. The generation of CQDs is shown in Fig. 8 : In the second step of hydrothermal reaction, NH4TiOF3 was completely converted into TiO2, where the carbonyl group of glucose has reduced Au3+ in HAuCl4·4H2O into Au nanoparticles. During the catalytic process of Au nanoparticles, HOCH2(CHOH)4CHO, HOCH2(CHOH)4COOH depolymerized into CQDs. The resulting composite g-C3N4/TiO2/NH4TiOF3 has enhanced photocurrent signal of PC compared to that of pure g-C3N4. Moreover, the construction and appearance of ternary heterojunction are responsible for the separation and transfer of photogenic carriers, indicates that composite has better PC activities. gCN/TO/CQDs/Au-3 exhibited improved PC photocurrent signals (Fig. 9a) due to the presence of LSPR effect of Au nanoparticles. The radius of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed the interfacial charge transfer process, where the smaller radii suggest the improved separation between electrons and holes, and fast interfacial electron transfer reaction (Fig. 9b). The composite material gCN/TO/CQDs/Au-3 exerted better electron separation and transfer effects, which is also consistent with the results of transient photocurrent. E VB = χ − E e + 0.56 E g E CB = E VB − E g where EVB is the potential valence band, χ is the semiconductor electronegativity, where g-C3N4 corresponds to 4.64 eV and TiO2 corresponds to 5.81 eV, respectively. Ee is the free electrons energy versus NHE (~4.5 eV). Eg is the band gap, where g-C3N4 is measured to be 2.8 eV by our own work and TiO2 is referred to 3.2 eV, taken from previous work [54]. As a result, the EVB of TiO2 and g-C3N4 are determined to be 2.91 eV and 1.54 eV while the ECB of TiO2 and g-C3N4 are determined to be −0.29 eV and −1.26 eV, respectively. A schematic is presented in (Fig. 9f) where the proposed mechanism can be understood. This mechanism is based on the following calculations: TiO2 is a wide bandgap semiconductor with valence band (VB, 2.91 eV NHE) and conduction band (CB, −0.29 eV NHE). In addition, the VB (1.54 eV NHE) and CB (−1.26 eV NHE) of g-C3N4 can be determined. The holes reacted with OH− (from TEOA) or water to form OH. E(OH/OH−) and E(OH/H2O) were estimated to be 1.99 and 2.70 eV, respectively. The REDOX potential of E(OH/OH−) cannot be completed by traditional type II heterojunctions. According to traditional type II heterojunction, the electrons are transferred from the CB of g-C3N4 to the CB of TiO2, while the holes are transferred from the VB of TiO2 to the CB of g-C3N4. The REDOX potential range is (−0.29–1.54 eV). Meanwhile, DMPO-O2 − is used to verify the creation and content of O2 −, (Fig. 9d). And it shows that the content of O2 − radical species increase with time. Comparative analysis of ESR spectrum of DMPO-OH (Fig. 9c) and the PL spectrum of capturing hydroxyl group in alkaline terephthalic acid (Fig. 9e), led us to predict that with the extension of illumination time, the signals are continuously strengthened which has continuously produced the hydroxyl radicals. It is concluded that hydroxyl radicals are constantly produced and driven by light. Moreover, E(OH/OH-) and E(OH/H2O) are estimated to be 1.99 and 2.70 eV, respectively. This REDOX potential is well beyond the provided range (−0.29–1.54 eV) of traditional type II heterojunctions. Therefore, the proposed Z-scheme heterojunction is proved to be reasonable (Fig. 9f). Upon sunlight irradiation, the electrons in CB of TiO2 will directly combine with the holes in the VB of g-C3N. The VB of TiO2 has holes that are captured by TBOA. The CB of g-C3N4 left a large number of electrons, which transfer to the catalyst surface and react with water, to generate H2. The reducibility of composite materials is superior to that of traditional type II heterojunction. The REDOX potential range (−1.26–2.91 eV) of our Z-scheme heterojunction can accomplish this task excellently. Precious metal Au nanoparticles have a large work function and are easy to accept electrons from CB of TiO2. Given this characteristic, Au nanoparticles are used as a solid electronic medium which has promoted the photoinduced electron on TiO2 with a low CB electric potential to bond with the hole on the other half of g-C3N4 with a high VB electric potential. Whereas, the electrons and holes with strong REDOX ability are still retained on the two semiconductors. Similar to the traditional Z-scheme heterojunction, the separation of electrons and holes at the interface is eventually achieved. This charge separation is responsible for the higher catalytic activity and REDOX capacity of our catalyst as compared to that of conventional Z-scheme heterojunction. The composite materials can release electrons with strong reducibility, showing unparalleled advantages for photocatalytic hydrogen production."
9,Conclusion,"The gCN/TO/CQDs/Au heterojunction with the good photocatalytic activity of hydrogen evolution has been successfully prepared by a two-step hydrothermal reaction. The Z-scheme heterojunction was constructed by stacking the structure of noble metal-CQDs-semiconductor. It is found that such structural composition has maximized the LSPR effect (using precious metals), the conversion photoluminescence characteristics of CQDs, and the significance of g-C3N4/TiO2 complementary materials. The composition and morphology of the composite were characterized by XRD, XPS, and TEM. We have also employed the PL, PC, and UV–Vis-NIR-DRS spectra, to characterize the photoelectric performance of the composite material. Our reported catalyst (gCN/TO/CQDs/Au) has significantly improved charge separation (e−/h+ pairs), excellent electron transfer. gCN/TO/CQDs/Au has a reasonable band gap width and good light absorption and utilization. We also proposed a possible reaction mechanism for the preparation of gCN/TO/CQDs/Au. Furthermore, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions are introduced and discussed. The photocatalytic hydrogen production of the composite material gCN/TO/CQDs/Au-3 shows an excellent hydrogen production rate (5.69 mmol/g/h) and good cycle stability under the sun, suggesting its potential application for solar water splitting hydrogen production."
