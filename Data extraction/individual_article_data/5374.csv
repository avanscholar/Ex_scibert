0,Introduction,"Hydrogen peroxide is an environment-friendly oxidant and liquid energy carrier for diverse applications. Alternative to the energy and waste intensitive anthraquinone method [1–5], H2O2 production via photocatalysis is a promising sustainable solar-to-chemical method to convert H2O and O2 over semiconductor photocatalysts [6–12]. Graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) is favorable for H2O2 production owing to the selective two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and negligible H2O2 decomposition [13–19]. Besides, the valance band position of GCN is 1.8 V (vs. RHE), thermodynamically capable of driving both the four-electron (1.23 V vs. RHE) and two-electron (1.78 V vs. RHE) water oxidation reaction (WOR) [7,20–22]. However, limited by sluggish water oxidation and fast charge recombination, H2O2 production over GCN is poor even under O2 atmosphere [14,23–26]. Organic electron donors such as isopropanol are frequently used to consume photogenerated holes and promote H2O2 production [27–30]. Nevertheless, the conversion efficiency from alcohol to H2O2 is extremely low (less than 1 mmol H2O2 production after consuming 100 mmol of alcohol) [9,28]. Moreover, the separation and purification to obtain pure H2O2 solution is costly due to the presence of the water soluble sacrificial agents and their oxidation products. Hence, it is significant to realize photocatalytic H2O2 production in the absence of sacrificial agents. Several strategies were developed to boost photocatalytic H2O2 production over GCN in pure water. Aromatic diimide or perylene imide was incorporated into GCN to induce positive shifts of the valance band positions and thus to elevate the oxidation power of photogenerated holes [22,31–33]. Anthraquinone and atomic cobalt were employed as separative cocatalysts to facilitate separation of charge carriers in the excited GCN [6]. Loading zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 was explored to improve O2 adsorption [34]; and grafting polyethyleneimine over GCN was developed to boost 2e-ORR pathway [35]. However, these strategies involve organic components and complex synthetic routes, and the amount of produced H2O2 is very low. Thus, it is still a big challenge to develop efficient and robust GCN based photocatalysts for H2O2 production in pure water. Red phosphorus (RP) is a promising narrow band-gap photocatalyst with a wide range of optical absorption (∼ 700 nm) [36,37]. GCN coupling with RP exhibited efficient photocatalytic performance on water splitting and pollutant degradation due to the accelerated separation of photogenerated charges [38–40]. However, as the reduction sites of ORR [41,42], RP can simultaneously induce rapid H2O2 reduction and thus limit its accumulation, which makes the RP/GCN composite undesirable for photocatalytic H2O2 production. Herein, we demonstrated a novel strategy, in which the decomposition of H2O2 over the RP/GCN catalyst is inhibited by preventing the interaction between H2O2 and RP via oxidizing RP without scarifying RP promotion effect on charge separation, leading to significant enhancement in photocatalytic H2O2 production from pure water."
1,Experimental section,
2,Synthesis of catalysts,"2.1 Synthesis of catalysts GCN was obtained by calcining 10 g of melamine (99 %, Sinopharm) at 550 °C for 240 min (10 °C/min of heating rate). Then, 200 mg of GCN and 400 mg of KH2PO2 (99 %, Sinopharm) were mixed and ground in a mortar. The mixed powders were calcinated at 300 °C for 120 min under Ar atmosphere (80 mL/min). After cooled to room temperature, the samples were taken an oxidation post-treatment by heating at 300 °C (2 °C/min of heating rate) for 120 min in an ambient condition. After washing by boiling water, filtering and vacuum drying at 60 °C, a red-brown product referred as oxidative red phosphorus (ORP)/GCN was obtained. RP/GCN was synthesized according to the same procedure as ORP/GCN but without the oxidation treatment."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku D/max-2200/PC) using a Cu-Kα radiation (40.0 kV, 30.0 mA and λ = 0.154 nm). X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) with an Axis Ultra DLD system (Shimadu-kratos) were used to determine the chemical states of elements and compositions of catalysts. To measure the work functions of catalysts, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed in conjunction with the XPS by using a homemade He lamp source which produces a resonance line He I and He II. In order to investigate the changes of electron density on the catalyst surface during light irradiation, in-situ irradiated XPS (ISI-XPS) measurements were carried out by placing a 50 W fiber light source (PLS-FX300HU, Beijing Perfectlight) ca. 20 cm away from the as-prepared catalysts during the XPS tests. Morphologies and elements mapping images of samples were observed by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) on a scanning electron microscope (Talos F200X, FEI, USA) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer (DRS, Lambda 950, PerkinElmer, USA) were used to investigate the optical properties of catalysts. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on a fluorescence spectrophotometer (LS 55, Perkin Elmer, USA) under 380 nm excitation. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were recorded by a QM/TM/IM steady-state time-resolved fluorescence spectrofluorometer (PTI, USA) under 380 nm excitation."
4,Photocatalytic performance,"2.3 Photocatalytic performance Photocatalytic H2O2 production was conducted in pure water (30 mL) containing 30 mg of catalysts in the absence of any sacrificial agents. During the test, the suspensions were continuously pumped with 0.5 L/min O2 (0.5 L/min N2). Photocatalytic water splitting over ORP/GCN was carried out in a Pyrex glass with an evacuation system. 100 mg catalysts were dispersed in 100 mL pure water without any cocatalyst. The amount of O2 were measured on an online gas chromatography (GC-9560, Huaai, China). Photocatalytic H2O2 decomposition was performed in a H2O2 solution (1000 μM) containing 30 mg of catalysts under N2 purging (0.5 L/min). A 500 W Xe lamp with a cut-off filter (λ ≥ 420 nm) was used to provide visible-light irradiation. H2O2 concentrations were measured via a modified DPD-POD method [43], and the dissolved oxygen in the suspension was recorded by a fiber optic oxygen meter (OXY-1 SMA, P​​reSens Precision Sensing GmbH, Germany). The electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer (Micro EPR, Bruker, Germany) were performed to detect the hydroxyl radicals (O H) in the reaction by using DMPO as the spin-trapping agents."
5,Disinfection experiment,"2.4 Disinfection experiment The E. coli suspension (DH5α, OD600 = 1.0) were prepared according to the literature [44]. In-situ photogenerated H2O2 solution over ORP/GCN in pure water at 0, 60, 120 min were used as the oxidant. The disinfection experiments were carried out by adding 0.1 mL of E. coli suspension (diluted by 100-fold) into 1.0 mL of H2O2 solution. After grown in the shaker for 240 min, 0.2 mL of mixture were cultured on LB agar plates at 37 °C for 720 min. The disinfection performance was determined by the growth of bacteria."
6,Electrochemical measurement,"2.5 Electrochemical measurement A CHI760E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua Co. Ltd, China) was used for electrochemical measurements. Mott-Schottky plots of the catalysts were investigated in a typical three-electrode cell with different frequency (1500, 3000 and 5000 Hz) at 5 mV amplitude in a 0.1 M NaClO4 solution (pH = 6.0) (Text S2). The electron transfer number of ORR were determined by linear sweep voltammetry on a rotating disc electrode (RDE), and the electron transfer number of WOR were determined by a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE, Pine Co. Ltd) (Text S3)."
7,Computation details,"2.6 Computation details First-principal calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) within the framework of the projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotential DFT method. The exchange and correlation energy have been described using the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerh (PBE) functional under generalized gradient approximations. The plane-wave cut off energy was set as 550 eV. All the atoms in the primitive cell were completely relaxed until none of the forces exceeded 0.01 eV Å−1. The Brillouin zone was sampled by using a 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh. A large vacuum layer of 20 Å was used to prevent the artificial interlayer interaction. The difference of interface charge density from the two individual parts was calculated by Eq. (1): (1) Δρ = ρ(P-H2O2) – ρP − ρH2O2 wherein, ρ(P-H2O2), ρP and ρH2O2 represent the charge density of P-H2O2, P, and H2O2, respectively. The XY-planar-averaged differential charge density was calculated from the difference of charge density. Furthermore, the number of transferred electrons could be obtained from planar-averaged electrostatic potential along the Z-axis of the adsorbed configuration. The amount of transferred charges (ΔQ) was obtained by the integral of Δρ from −∞ to Z."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterization of catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of catalysts RP/GCN was obtained by calcing the mixture of GCN and KH2PO2 at 300 °C, which was converted into ORP/GCN after heating at 300 °C in an ambient condition. The XRD patterns (Fig. 1 A) of RP/GCN and ORP/GCN display two peaks at 13.0° and 27.1°, corresponding to (100) and (002) diffraction planes of GCN, respectively [13,17]. A new peak at 15.0° is attributed to the (013) facet of red phosphorous [38]. According to the X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) measurements, the P 2p spectrum (Fig. 1B) for RP/GCN is deconvoluted into three peaks centering at 129.5 eV, 130.4 eV and 133.4 eV, respectively. The former two peaks are assigned to the P 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of RP [45–47], accounting for 76.1 % of the total P in this catalyst (Table S1). The weak peak at 133.4 eV is ascribed to the PN bond (occupying 23.9 %), which serves as the nucleation sites for the growth of RP on the tri-s-triazine units of GCN [38]. As for ORP/GCN, the percentage of RP slightly decreases to 72.8 %, indicating the residual RP is also dominant and partial elementary P converts into compound form. The binding energy of the weakest peak negatively shifts to 133.2 eV, and its percentage for the overall P contents increases to 27.2 %. The peak ascribing to P 2p in P2O5 (at 135.0 eV) cannot be detected. The difference of the O 1s spectra between RP/GCN and ORP/GCN confirms the incorporation of O in the catalyst. For the O 1s spectrum of RP/GCN, only one peak at 532.4 eV corresponding to the CO bond is observed [48]. However, a new peak at 530.6 eV appears in the spectrum of ORP/GCN, which can be assigned to the PO bonds. These reveal the formation of PO bond on the surface of RP after oxidation post-treatment. The distribution of C, N, O and P elements in the catalysts was observed via TEM and EDX mapping. GCN exhibits the stacked layers of nanosheets without obvious lattice fringes due to its weak crystallinity (Fig. S1). TEM images of ORP/GCN (Fig. 1 C and D) show an obvious interplanar spacing of 0.54 nm in the nanosheet structure, which corresponds to the (001) facet of Hittorf's red phosphorus [38,46]. According to the EDX mapping (Figs. 1 E and S2c), the highlights of P, C and N elements are not overlapped, indicating the inhomogeneous distribution of the three elements over RP/GCN and ORP/GCN. This suggests ORP/GCN is a hetero-phase junction consisting of oxidative RP and GCN rather than a P-doping GCN. The overlapped distribution of O and P indicates the formation of oxidized phosphorus species in ORP/GCN. RP/GCN has similar morphology and elementary mapping (Fig. S2) as ORP/PCN except the oxygen distribution, which is sparser than that in ORP/GCN and inconsistent with the P sites, suggesting the absence of ORP in the heterostructure of RP/GCN."
10,Efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production over ORP/GCN,"3.2 Efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production over ORP/GCN Fig. 2 A shows the photocatalytic H2O2 production over the four catalysts under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm) in pure water (purging with 0.5 L/min oxygen). The H2O2 production over GCN or RP is negligible (less than 10 μM). The incorporation of RP on GCN significantly promotes H2O2 production, and more than 130 μM of H2O2 can be detected in 120 min. Oxidation post-treatment of RP/GCN almost doubles H2O2 production, about 250 μM of H2O2 was obtained in 120 min, which is more than 25-fold of that over GCN. Photocatalytic H2O2 production over ORP/GCN continuously increases to over 400 μM in 600 min (Fig. S3). Upon monochromatic light irradiation (Fig. S4), ORP/GCN produces 48 μM of H2O2 at 420 nm in 60 min, and the value decreases with the increase of wavelength. The results fit well with the DRS spectrum of ORP/GCN. As an on-site generated oxidant, the H2O2 solution was mixed with the E. coli suspension, resulting in effectively inhibition of the baterial growth (Fig. S5). This inidicates the great potential for on-site disinfection and antisepsis by using the photogenerated pure H2O2 solution. The electron transfer number (n) of ORR over ORP/GCN was determined by RDE measurements. According to the fitted Koutecky-Levich plots (Fig. 2B) from LSV curves (Fig. S6), the number of electron transfer is in the range of 2.05∼2.08, indicating that ORR over ORP/GCN is dominated by a two-electron pathway, which is conducive to H2O2 production at neutral pH conditions. The effect of dissolved oxygen concentrations on H2O2 production were investigated by oxygen or nitrogen purging and without purging (Fig. 2C). When the suspensions are continuously purged by N2 (0.5 L/min), the balance O2 concentration decreases to a very low value (0.2 mg/L, Fig. S7). However, at the N2 purging condition, the H2O2 concentrations over RP/GCN and ORP/GCN after 120 min irradiation are 35 μM and 150 μM (Fig. 2C), respectively. When N2 flow rate increases from 0.5 L/min to 1.5 L/min, H2O2 production decreases from 84.4 μM to 75.6 μM in 60 min (Fig. S8). This indicates that H2O2 can be produced at a very low oxygen concentration. Thus, ORR is not the exclusive pathway for H2O2 production, and WOR may occurs simultaneously in the system. A control test was performed by using CH2Cl2 to replace water as the solvent in the O2 purging conditions. As shown in Fig. S9, negligible H2O2 (< 5 μM) is detected after 120 min irradiation in the CH2Cl2 suspension. However, in a mixture of CH2Cl2 and water (1:2 v/v), 145 μM of H2O2 is produced, and this value further increases in pure water. This indicates that water is necessary to consume photoinduced holes and enable H2O2 production via oxygen reduction. Photocatalytic oxygen evolution over ORP/GCN were investigated, and results are shown in Fig. S10. ORP/GCN (1 g/L) produces 0.25 μmol/min H2 from water reduction, while negligible O2 is detected during water splitting. This suggests WOR contributes to photocatalytic H2O2 production over ORP/GCN catalysts. RRDE tests were carried out to determine the electron transfer number in photocatalytic WOR over ORP/GCN. When the potential of Pt ring electrode is applied at -0.23 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) where O2 can be reduced [49], ORP/GCN produces obvious photocurrent at the disk electrode (λ ≥ 420 nm), while the ring current shows no change (Fig. S11). This indicates that oxygen production is negligible in photocatalytic WOR over ORP/GCN. However, when the ring potential is kept at 0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) where H2O2 can be oxidized [49], the ring current increases to 0.19∼0.20 μA and the disk current increases to 0.51∼0.54 μA upon light irradiation (Fig. 4D). The electron transfer number (Fig. S12) was calculated to be 1.9∼2.0 according to Eq. (S4), implying that photocatalytic WOR proceed through a two-electron pathway. These results suggest that photocatalytic WOR over ORP/GCN is dominated by a selective two-electron pathway."
11,Mechanism discussion,"3.3 Mechanism discussion The mechanism on the enhanced photocatalytic H2O2 production over ORP/GCN in pure water is explored. Compared with light yellow GCN, the hybridization of RP (fuchsia color) and GCN obviously changes the color to dark brown (Fig. 3 A). Accordingly, their optical absorption ranges are broadened. The absorption of GCN is negligible above 450 nm, while RP possesses a strong light harvest with a 700 nm of absorption edge. Thus, RP/GCN and ORP/GCN show obvious red-shifting absorption edges. Although ORP/GCN displays slightly decreased light absorption intensity than RP/GCN, H2O2 production in 120 min over the former is 1.9-fold and 4.3-fold of that over the latter under saturated and low O2 (N2 purging) concentration, respectively. This suggests enhanced light harvesting cannot explain the improved photocatalytic performance over ORP/GCN. Mott-Schottky (Fig. 3B) and Tauc tests (Fig. 3C) were carried out to determine the energy levels and band gaps of GCN and RP, which are the main components of the hybrid catalysts. The flat bands (Efb) of GCN and RP are -0.91 V and -0.11 V (vs. RHE), and their conduction bands (ECB) are -1.01 and -0.21 V (Efb = ECB-0.1), respectively. Considering the band gaps of GCN (2.88 eV) and RP (1.94 eV), their valance band are deduced to be 1.87 V and 1.73 V (vs. RHE), respectively. This indicates that GCN is thermodynamically satisfied for 2e-WOR (H2O2/H2O, 1.78 V vs. RHE). Moreover, the more negative conduction band of GCN than RP enables photogenerated electrons to transfer from the former to the latter [50,51]. The delocalization of photogenerated charges was proven by the ISI-XPS spectra and UPS spectra. The high-resolution N 1s spectrum of ORP/GCN (Fig. 3D) can be deconvoluted into three peaks locating at 398.1 eV, 399.3 eV and 400.5 eV, which are assigned to the sp2-hybridized nitrogen (CNC), tertiary nitrogen (N(C)3) and amino functions (CNH) involved in the tri-s-triazine units of GCN, respectively. Upon light irradiation (Fig. 3D), the positive shift of N 1s binding energies for tertiary nitrogen (N(C)3, 399.3 eV) and amino nitride (CNH, 400.5 eV) are 0.2 eV. Meanwhile, a negative shift (0.2 eV) of P 2p peak can be observed upon light irradiation (Fig. S13). The changes suggest light irradiation induces electron transfer from GCN to RP, resulting in the decrease and increase of electron density on GCN and RP, respectively [52–54]. The work functions (Φ) of GCN and RP were determined by UPS spectra (Fig. S14), and the values are 3.22 eV and 2.22 eV for GCN and RP, respectively. RP possesses a higher Fermi level than GCN. Then, the electrons in RP can spontaneously flow toward GCN through the junctions to reach an equilibrium Fermi level. This would result in a heterojunction interface with positively charged RP and negatively charged GCN [36,54]. Therefore, an internal electric field between RP and GCN will form, and accordingly prevent hole transfer but promote electron migration from GCN to RP. Thus, the spatial separation of charge carriers in the hybrid catalysts is facilitated. As shown in the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 3E), the PL intensities of RP/GCN and ORP/GCN are much lower than that of GCN, suggesting the incorporation of RP or ORP can promote separation of photogenerated charges and suppress electron-hole recombination. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL, Fig. 3F) spectra show that the lifetime of exited carriers on RP/GCN (τ = 1.42 ns) and ORP/GCN (τ = 1.60 ns) are much shorter than that of GCN (τ = 2.85 ns), demonstrating the enhanced photo-exciton dissociation in the heterostructure catalysts [6,41]. The photocurrent of ORP/GCN and RP/GCN are higher than pristine GCN (Fig. S15). RP/GCN produces the highest photocurrent, indicating the best performance of charge separation. This is consistent with the results of steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra that ORP/GCN has a slightly larger τ value than RP/GCN. However, ORP/GCN possesses a much better performance in photocatalytic H2O2 production. This suggests that besides separation of photogenerated charges, H2O2 production is also significantly depended on surface reaction processes. H2O2 decomposition under N2 purging conditions was investigated. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the light irradiation of 120 min decomposed only 10 % of H2O2 over ORP/GCN (red line), but almost 80 % of H2O2 over RP/GCN (blue line). Considering H2O2 is mainly produced via the WOR pathway in the absence of oxygen, a kinetic model (Test S1) was developed to analyze H2O2 formation and decomposition [29,55] and the curves of H2O2 production are fitted well with the model (Fig. S16, Table S2). The results show that the H2O2 decomposition rate constant is 21-fold smaller than that of RP/GCN. This suggests that H2O2 consumption on RP/GCN is much faster than ORP/GCN, which severely restrict the accumulation of photogenerated H2O2 in the RP/GCN system. DFT calculation was performed to understand H2O2 adsorption and dissociation on the surface of RP and ORP. According to the structural model of RP [56–58], three possible adsorption sites (Fig. S17) with different orientations of H2O2 were taken into consideration. The most stable adsorption configuration (Fig. S17A) possesses the lowest adsorption energy of -3.17 eV, much lower than that of the other two (−0.019 eV and −0.088 eV). In this configuration, H2O2 is adsorbed on RP with an O atom pointing toward the surface P atom, inducing the dissociation of the OO bond and formation of a PO bond. This can be ascribed to the lone pairs of electrons on P atoms, which favors to active H2O2 and initiate decomposition. Thus, 20 % of H2O2 can be consumed in 120 min by RP/GCN even in the dark condition (green line in Fig. 4A). Upon light irradiation, photogenerated electrons migrate to P atoms, accordingly promoting H2O2 decomposition over RP/GCN. The decomposition of H2O2 is further explored via EPR tests by using DMPO as the trap. No EPR signal of DMPO-O OH adducts is observed in the EPR spectra of both RP/GCN and ORP/GCN systems under dark or light irradiation (Fig. S18). Dissolved oxygen concentrations in the suspensions with H2O2 and RP/GCN under both dark or light irradiation are detected (Fig. S19). The oxygen concentration does not increase under both conditions, while a significant increase of oxygen concentration can be observed in the presence of MnO2. This indicates that H2O2 decomposition over RP/GCN is not dominated by oxidative pathways. No signal of DMPO-O H adducts is detected in the RP/GCN suspension at dark (Fig. 4B). However, obvious signals of DMPO-O H adducts can be detected after 30 min irradiation, indicating H2O2 decomposition by photo-induced electron is mainly through a reductive pathway accompanying with the production of hydroxyl radical. As for ORP/GCN, O H signal was not detected in the suspension under both light-irradiated and dark condition, implying the suppressed decomposition of H2O2 over ORP/GCN. However, the XPS spectra of ORP/GCN after reaction was measured, and the valence state of P and N have very slight changes (Fig. S20), indicating the decomposition of H2O2 and oxidation of ORP/GCN cannot be eliminated for ORP/GCN. DFT calculation in Fig. S21 displays a configuration of H2O2 adsorption on oxidative RP. H2O2 favors to be adsorbed toward O atoms on the oxidative RP via hydrogen bonds with -0.47 eV of adsorption energy. The presence of surface oxygen atoms blocks the direct contact and redox between H2O2 and P atoms, as well as the accordingly decomposition of H2O2. As shown in Fig. 4 C and D, H2O2 adsorption decreases the bond length of OO by about 0.1 Å, suggesting H2O2 become more stable, and the activation and decomposition of H2O2 is unfavorable in this case. Moreover, there are 5.00 × 10−5 e of charge transfer from H2O2 to ORP in the region of H2O2 adsorbing on ORP. The electron accumulation region in ORP would inhibit the migration of photogenerated electrons toward H2O2 [59], which further suppresses H2O2 photodecomposition and thus enhances H2O2 photoproduction. According to above discussion, the enhanced photocatalytic H2O2 production over ORP/GCN can be understood by Scheme 1 . For GCN, fast electron-hole recombination severely restricts H2O2 production. After loading RP on GCN, photo-generated electrons are facilitated to transfer from GCN to RP, resulting in enhanced H2O2 production over RP/GCN, while photo-generated holes retain on the VB of GCN for WOR and H2O2 production. However, the formed H2O2 can be easily decomposed on RP, limiting H2O2 production. The oxidation post-treatment introduces PO bonds on the surface of ORP/GCN, which serve as the adsorption sites for H2O2 and suppress the direct interaction between H2O2 and P atoms. Thus, photocatalytic H2O2 decomposition over ORP/GCN are greatly restrained, and H2O2 accumulation are dramatically enhanced."
12,Conclusion,"In summary, we developed a metal free material by loading oxidative red phosphorus on graphitic carbon nitride, which can induce 25-fold enhancement of H2O2 production without any sacrificial agent. H2O2 is produced through two-electron ORR over ORP/GCN accompanying with synchronous water oxidation in pure water. The highly promoted photocatalytic performance of ORP/GCN is ascribe to the improved charge carrier separation and suppressed H2O2 decomposition. The photocatalysts realize a high H2O2 production in pure water, which facilitates the direct in-situ utilization of the produced H2O2 solution. Simultaneously, the deciphered mechanism on the critical role of surface oxidation brings insights for design of robust metal-free materials with desirable performance in solar energy conversion."
