0,Introduction,"Biological hydrogen fuel production is a challenging area of biotechnology. Photobiological processes, by which microalgae or photosynthetic bacteria produce H2 from sunlight and either water or organic substrates, respectively, have been studied for several decades, but are limited by many practical and fundamental limitations (Benemann, 1997; Levin et al., 2004; Nath and Das, 2004). Dark bacterial hydrogen fermentations or organic substrates also have limitations, principally the relatively low yields of hydrogen obtained until now, with typically only 10–20%, and at most 30%, of the substrate energy converted to H2 fuel (Das and Veziroglu, 2001; Van Ginkel and Logan, 2005). This compares to 80–90% yields obtained in commercial ethanol or methane fermentations (Claassen et al., 1999). Higher yields may be achievable, in principle, through metabolic engineering (Hallenback and Benemann, 2002; Keasling et al., 1998) but, thus far, no major improvements in yields have been reported. Methane fermentations, also called anaerobic digestion, involve consortia of two major types of bacteria: the so-called acidogenic bacteria that break down the substrates into mainly H2, acetic acid and CO2, and the methanogenic bacteria, that convert acetic acid, H2 and CO2 to methane gas. A variety of higher organic acids, such as propionic, butyric and lactic, as well as alcohols and ketones, are also formed during the breakdown of the organic substrates by the highly diverse populations generically known as acidogens. However, in a well operating process, these products are mostly converted to acetic acid and H2, which, in turn, are then converted to methane gas. The key to this process is that the H2 produced by the acetogenic bacteria is removed to a very low partial pressure, typically in the nanomolar range, by the methanogenic bacteria, which allows the otherwise thermodynamically unfavorable metabolism of the higher organic acids and alcohols to acetic acid and H2 (Belaich et al., 1990). The result of this comensal relationship is an overall high yield conversion of fermentable substrates to methane fuel with at most trace amounts of H2 present in the gas phase (Ferris, 1993). Indeed, even a small amount of H2 (>0.1%) in the gas phase indicates a malfunctioning process, due to overload, toxicity, or other factors unbalancing the comensal relationships, generally followed by a cessation of CH4-production. However, the two reactions, formation of organic acids and H2 and methane-production, can, at least partially be separated into separate bioreactors in series, in which the first, smaller, reactor produces organic acids, H2 and CO2, while the second, much larger, reactor produces CH4 and CO2. Such two-phase anaerobic digestions were proposed as a way to optimize for the growth of each type of bacteria in the separate reactors, specifically by growing the acetogenic bacteria at a lower pH (e.g., 5–6) and short hydraulic residence time (typically 1–2 days) in the first stage, while the slower growing methanogenic bacteria stage, requiring a more neutral pH, were preferentially cultured in the second stage with a much longer hydraulic residence time (typically 10–20 days), (Blonskaja et al., 2003; Demirel and Yenigun, 2002; Pohland and Ghosh, 1971). However, as noted above, anaerobic digestion involves a comensal interaction of the two general types of bacterial populations, in which the methanogens feed on and efficiently remove, the waste products (H2 and acetic acid) of the acidogenic bacteria. Thus separating these two basic processes will not generally significantly accelerate or increase overall methane-production, although it can be of some advantage in making the process more resistant to shock loading. In earlier work on two-phase anaerobic digestion, the gas, H2 and CO2, produced in the first stage was transferred to the second stage to be converted to CH4, and, indeed, few measurements on gas production from the first phase are reported in the literature. However, due to the burgeoning interest in H2 fuels and fuel cells, there has been a great deal of research in recent years on dark H2 fermentations (Das and Veziroglu, 2001; Hallenback and Benemann, 2002; Levin et al., 2004) which, essentially, correspond to the first phase of such a two-phase anaerobic digestion process. However, as stated above, in all such studies, the overall H2 yields are low, only 10–20% of the substrate energy being converted to H2 fuel with the remainder converted to organic acids, and other products. A number of authors have proposed converting these by-products to H2 fuel using photosynthetic bacteria, which can exhibit high yields, though at very low solar conversion efficiencies (Miyake, 1998), which makes such an approach impractical. Producing methane gas in a second reactor has been proposed as another option (Benemann, 1998), and some work on such dual H2 and CH4-production has appeared recently (Benemann et al., 2004; Kramer and Bagley, 2004). However, if H2-production is the objective, it is more direct and plausible to produce methane gas by normal anaerobic digestion and then convert this fuel to H2 through a conventional reformer process. A potential near-term practical application of two-phase anaerobic digestion is the production of H2–CH4 methane mixtures. H2–CH4 mixtures, in the range of 10–30% H2 and 90–70% CH4, on a volumetric basis, are known to burn with much lower NO x emission in internal combustion engines, and this allows the use of such fuels in regions where NO x emissions are strictly regulated (Bauer and Forest, 2001; Collier et al., 1996). Here we address the co-production of H2 and CH4 mixtures in a two phase anaerobic digestion process, using a simulated high carbohydrate wastewater with a mixed bacterial population obtained from a conventional anaerobic digester under operating conditions designed to simulate a scaled-up process."
1,Methods,
2,Two-stage anaerobic bioreactor system,"2.1 Two-stage anaerobic bioreactor system The two-stage anaerobic bioreactor system (Fig. 1 ) consisted of a 4.7 L polycarbonate jar with cover (DS5300-9609, Nalgene, Rochester, NY) for the first (“hydrogen-production,”) reactor and a 18.8L polycarbonate jar and cover (DS5300-9212, Nalgene) for the second (“methane-production”) reactor. The working volumes were 2.0 and 15.0L, respectively. All connections were made with Teflon tubing (890 FEP, Nalgene) and stainless steel or nylon compression fittings (Swagelok Co., Solon, Ohio). The lids for the reactors were sealed by compression against an o’ring using two steel plates placed above and below the reactor and bolted in place along four corners. The assembled reactors were independently tested for gas leakage by introducing nitrogen gas via a gas sparging port and with an exhaust tube placed at the bottom of a graduated cylinder filled with 45.0cm of water (corresponding to a pressure head of about 0.05bar or 0.67psi). After the nitrogen flow was stopped the gas level in the submersed exhaust tube remained constant for at least 1h, indicating no significant gas leakage. The reactors were mixed by placing each reactor on a magnetic stirrer (PC-310, Corning Inc., Corning, NY) and stirring with 1.5in. magnetic stir bars. When the hydrogen and methane-production reactors were operated independently (“non-integrated operation”), the effluent from each reactor was peristaltically pumped to separate waste bottles. When operated as a two-phase process (“integrated operation”), the effluent from the first reactor was pumped into the second reactor. In both cases, peristaltic pumping of reactor media was through a tube that was placed below the surface of the reactor liquid, to avoid the exchange of gases between the two reactors, foam fractionation and related artifacts. The liquid height and thus reactor volume in both reactors was thus controlled by a conductivity sensor which activated a peristaltic effluent pump when the liquid reached the tip the of the sensor. In all experiments, in the first (hydrogen-production) reactors the conductivity sensor was set to a height that maintained a working volume of 2.0L while in the second (methane-production) reactors the height was set to a working volume of 15.0L. The feed medium was held in a polyethylene tank with a capacity of 114.0L, maintained at 5°C with an internal aluminum coil heat exchanger (EX11, Aquatic Eco-systems Inc., Apopka, FL), connected to an external, setpoint controlled cryostat (Ultratemp, 2000, Julabo Labortecknic, Germany) and mixed with a magnetic stir bar. Mixing in both reactors was deliberately low to better reflect conditions of industrial-scale systems, where high mixing rates normally used in experimental bioreactors are not applicable. The feed tubings were replaced daily or every 2 days, as needed. Nitrogen gas was bubbled continuously through the medium to help maintain an anaerobic environment. The feed media was delivered to the reactors by peristaltic pumping through Teflon tubing (101U/R, Watson–Marlow Ltd., Cornwall, England). The pumps were calibrated and their feed rates periodically verified gravimetrically. Temperature and pH in both reactors were controlled with a MicroDCU unit (B. Braun Biotech Inc., Allentown, PA) and continuously logged through a RS232 serial interface connected to an external Dell 4100 computer (Dell, Texas USA). Temperature was measured in situ using PT-100 probes and the pH with gel-based probes (Mettler-Toledo, Greifensee, Switzerland) and maintained at 35°C±0.1°C in both reactors using 200W and 450W cartridge heaters (McMaster-Carr, Los Angeles, CA), in the first and second reactors, respectively. pH was controlled at 5.5 in the first reactor and at 7.0 in the second reactor through automated addition of sodium hydroxide. The concentration of base was 2.0M, but was increased to 4.0 and 6.0M during the experiments using the high feed concentrations. The total base consumed was calculated from the recorded “on-time” of the base pump and the base consumption rate was calculated by least squares regression of the data with respect to time over a 60min s interval. Data was calculated in 1 or 2min intervals and logged using Lab View. For each steady state, rates (gas evolution, base addition) were averaged over a 24h period that demonstrated consistent data and did not exhibit mechanical or other interruptions (foaming, clogged lines, lack of mixing, or power outages). Steady state was assumed to have been reached after at least two full residence times (i.e. reactors volumes) had passed and the gas evolution rate (estimated over a 20–24h period) had steadied to the same value over 3 days."
3,"Media, inoculum, and start-up","2.2 Media, inoculum, and start-up The standard media used for the batch and continuous experiments consisted of (per liter): 10.0g glucose, 1.5g KH2PO4, 1.67 Na2HPO4, 0.5 NH4Cl, 0.18 MgCl·6H2O, 2.0g yeast extract, 2.0g peptone, 0.02ml antifoam A (Sigma). In some experiments this media was modified by increasing the feed glucose concentration or by doubling the concentration of peptone and yeast extract per liter (termed 2N as opposed to 1N for the standard medium) as described. The carbon to nitrogen ratio calculated for each media formulation was calculated by summing the grams of carbon and nitrogen (per liter) provided by the glucose, ammonium chloride, peptone, and yeast extract. The contribution of nitrogen and carbon (per liter) from peptone (15.4% N, 31.5% C) and yeast extract (18% N and 32% C) was estimated by summing the contributions of carbon and nitrogen from the components (i.e., amino acids, casein, etc.) in each as per the compositional analysis provided by the manufacturers. The C:N molmol−1 ratio of the standard medium was 7.59. Anaerobic digester sludge was collected from the Hawaii Kai Waste Water Treatment Plant (Hawaii Kai, HI) and stored at 4°C until 5.0ml of the well-mixed sludge was used to innoculate both reactors. No pre-treatment (e.g., heating to help select for spore-forming anaerobes) was applied, to better reflect larger-scale processes where self-selecting bacterial populations would likely dominate after a relatively short initial period. To establish the methanogenic culture, the second reactor was initially operated independently of the first, by directly feeding it standard media at increasingly greater flow rates. Once a methane volume percentage of 50% was achieved, effluent from the first hydrogen-production reactor was used to slowly replace the second reactor media feed, eventually achieving a fully integrated operation of a two-phase anaerobic digestion process. For the batch cultures, each reactor was drained to one fourth its volume and fresh standard media was added, over a 5min period. The reactors were briefly deaerated with N2 gas before being sealed and liquid and gas phase measurements initiated, as in the continuous cultivation experiments."
4,Gas evolution rate measurements,"2.3 Gas evolution rate measurements The gas production rate from each reactor was measured on-line using high precision gas meters built in-house consisting of a pressure transducer, a three-way solenoid valve, a ballast chamber and custom built circuit boards. The gas meters were calibrated with a peristaltic pump that delivered a precise volume of gas over a defined time interval measured with a digital flowmeter (model 520, Fisher Scientific) which gave a linear response for valve actuation rate vs. gas flow rate. The calibrated gas meters were connected to the head space of the reactor. The gas meter response was not perturbed with regard to the action of the liquid level control, confirming the accuracy of the gas flow measurements and the general gas-tightness of the bioreactors. Leakages from the first and second reactors over a 44 h period was found to be only 2.1mlh−1 and 3.7mlh−1, respectively, which did not impact the results. Repeated calibration curves over the 6-month period of the experiments were stable, reliable and linear upto 600.0mlh−1. A full description of the gas meter is described elsewhere (Cooney et al., 2006)."
5,Gas- and liquid-phase metabolite analysis,"2.4 Gas- and liquid-phase metabolite analysis The gas composition of the reactor headspace was measured using an Agilent Technologies 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with two columns separated by a switching valve as designed by the manufacturer. The first column was a Plot Q polymer column (19091P-Q04, Agilent Technologies), to separate CO2 and higher molecular weight compounds, and the second a molecular sieve column (19091P-MS8, Agilent Technologies) to separate the lower molecular weight gases (H2, O2, N2, CH4). Calibration curves generated for these five components were linear and reproducible. Liquid phase volatile organic acids (VOAs) were analyzed by HPLC analysis (1100 series, Agilent Technologies). Separation was achieved using a 0.1% H2SO4 mobile phase pumped at a rate of 0.8mlmin−1 through a Supelcogel C-610H ion exchange column maintained at 30°C. The injection volume of sample was 10.0 μL. Detection was accomplished using an RI detector maintained at 30°C with a Timberline TL-105 column heater (Timberline Instruments, Boulder, CO). To identify the retention times of unknown peaks, over 30 compounds were screened. Based upon these results, a calibration mixture was made up with eleven metabolites normally present at significant levels in samples from the two bioreactors."
6,Carbon mass balance,"2.5 Carbon mass balance A carbon balance was calculated around each reactor (when run independently) by comparing the carbon entering the reactor (i.e., feed glucose, yeast extract, and peptone) against the carbon leaving the bioreactor (i.e., liquid and gas phase metabolites, biomass, and unconsumed peptone and yeast extract). The carbon entering the reactor was calculated using the MW of glucose and an estimated value of 1.27gCL−1 for YE and peptone added at 2.0g yeast extract and 2.0g peptone per liter (e.g., manufacturers information on carbon content of YE and from the amino acid(s) composition of peptone). The carbon in the liquid phase VOAs was calculated from the HPLC measurements. The carbon in the dissolved carbon dioxide and methane was calculated using Henry’s law coefficients of 29.76 and 714.0atm−1 mol−1, respectively, and by taking into account the carbon dioxide held in the form of carbonate and bicarbonate (Blanch and Clark, 1997). The carbon in the biomass leaving the bioreactor was estimated by assuming a yield coefficient of 0.2 gram dry weight per gram glucose consumed, and a biomass carbon composition of 50%, considered reasonable as much of the biomass would be derived from the input yeast and peptone extracts. The carbon leaving in the form of unconsumed peptone or yeast extract was calculated assuming that only 60% of both media was consumed (40% of each was left). While it is acknowledged that this value is practically impossible to accurately approximate, it nevertheless accounts for some carbon and the effect of changing this value is discussed below."
7,Statistical analysis,"2.6 Statistical analysis Fermentation data presented in Tables 1, 3, and 4 are presented as averaged values with standard deviations calculated in Microsoft Excel over two or three measurements taken on separate days after steady state was achieved. In all cases HPLC (e.g., VOAs) and GC (e.g., headspace % H2 and CH4) measurements were taken 2, 3, and even 4 days prior to the steady state being declared, with these values used as a baseline to gauge the correctness of the steady state measurements (i.e., their values were used as a trend to gauge if any one measurement was unrealistic). The exception is the base consumption rate which is presented as a single value taken from linear regression fit over a 24h period (R 2 values above 0.95). For those cases where the headspace H2 and CH4 values were low (e.g., less than 1%) compared to the accuracy of the TCD detector, averages and standard deviations are not given. The statistical relevance of comparisons between steady states within Tables 1, 3 and 4 (H2 Rxr or CH4 Rxr) were evaluated using Tukey’s pairwise comparisons with a family error rate of 5% (i.e. 95% confidence level) executed through the ANOVA one-way analysis function of the statistical software analysis program MINITAB (SBTI, San Marcos Texas)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Culture start-up and individual reactor performance with varying dilution rates,"3.1 Culture start-up and individual reactor performance with varying dilution rates Both reactors were inoculated with digester sludge (see methods) and were then operated with standard media at dilutions of 1.0 followed by 2.0Ld−1 over a period of 2 months, to autoselect the appropriate cultures, with the first, 2L hydrogen-production, reactor maintained at pH 5.5 and the second, 15L methane, reactor maintained at pH 7.0. After a relatively long lag time, both reactors established cultures that exhibited the desired headspace gas composition (e.g., ∼35% H2 in the hydrogen-production reactor and 54% CH4 in the methane-production reactor, with the remainder mostly CO2 in both cases). The results indicate that these reactors operated with standard media, at these pH levels and dilutions, select for bacterial cultures that are mainly either H2 or CH4 producers. The effect of dilution rate at constant substrate concentration with standard medium was first investigated for each reactor operated independently. The media supply rate was increased in steps and the results are summarized in Table 1 . Results for the methane-production reactor are only reported for dilution rates at 0.27h−1 and above because of the time it took for this system to achieve stable and steady operations. Both reactors were quite stable and able to withstand occasional disturbances, such as down time due to power outages, reductions in the feed rate due to crimping of the feed lines in the peristaltic pumps, or fluctuations in temperature or mixing, when the magnetic stir bars were temporarily destabilized. From Table 1, the H2-production rate increased with feed rate until 5.0Ld−1, achieving a total gas evolution rate of 139mlh−1, of which 35% were H2 and the balance mostly CO2, with only trace amounts of CH4. As the feed rate was increased to 6Ld−1, total gas and H2-production declined to values that were statistically below all steady states except that for 2Ld−1 (i.e., SS1, Tukey’s pairwise comparison, family error rate of 5%), presumably due to wash-out of the bacterial population (Van Ginkel and Logan, 2005). Although the glucose provided was completely consumed, for all dilutions the calculated H2 yields from glucose were below 1.0molmol−1, an observation assumed due to domination by lactic acid producing bacteria, as lactate was the main metabolite at each steady state (Table 1, H2Rxr). Their dominance and low H2 yields were due to the use of non-heat treated inoculum, and the low mixing in the reactor, both of which favored lactic acid bacteria, lack of mixing by increasing the liquid-side partial pressure of hydrogen, both reflecting the conditions expected in process scale-up. Although heat treatment will kill most facultative bacteria and select for spore forming clostridia, which allows experimental production of hydrogen gas at higher yields, this would be only a transient phenomenon, as contaminants entering with the feed or otherwise would rapidly dominate such reactors, particularly when operating at short retention times of 1 day or less. Indeed, even in these experiments the feed tank, although refrigerated, exhibited visual growth of bacteria, presumably lactic acid bacteria, as did the media feed lines, which had to be cleaned and replaced about every 2 days. The methane-production rate in the CH4-production reactor similarly peaked at a feed rate of 5.0Ld−1 with a statistically significant gas evolution rate of 171.74mlh−1 and methane head space composition of 38.13% (Table 1, Tukey’s pairwise comparison, family error rate of 5%). As the feed rate was increased to 6Ld−1 the gas production rate decreased to a value that was significantly lower than SS3 and SS4 (Table 1, Tukey’s pairwise comparison, family error rate of 5%). The highest methane to glucose yields of 0.21 and 0.22 were found at the lower feed rates of 4.0 and 5.0Ld−1, with a statistically significant drop to 0.03 at the highest feed rate of 6.0Ld−1 (Table 1, Tukey’s pairwise comparisons, family error rate of 5%). The dominant liquid phase metabolites at lower feed rates were acetate and acetone (∼1.97 and 2.0gL−1) with format, acetate, ethanol, butyrate approaching or surpassing levels above 1.0gL−1 at the higher feed rate of 6.0Ld−1. In the cases of formate, ethanol, and butyrate their values at 6.0Ld−1 were statistically higher than their levels at the lower steady states (Table 1, Tukey’s pairwise comparison, family error rate of 5%). In the case of acetate its value at 6.0Ld−1 was statistically lower that its value at 5Ld−1 but only statistically indistinguishable from 4Ld−1 (Table 1, Tukey’s pairwise comparison, family error rate of 5%). No lactate was present at measurable levels. The low methane yield based on glucose is likely due to both the relatively short retention times of these reactors and the high biomass yield coefficient possible through use of the yeast and peptone hydrolyzates. A carbon balance around the H2-producing reactor closed to an average of 1% over all steady states (e.g., between 93% and 110%) but only to an average of 70% over all steady states for the CH4-producing reactor, leaving a significant fraction of the carbon unaccounted for (Table 2 ). The HPLC chromatograms of the CH4-production reactor effluent did not reveal the emergence of any new and unaccounted peaks that could explain the missing carbon. One possible source could be in the estimated percentage of feed peptone and yeast extract that was consumed. If the percent of the carbon in the peptone and yeast extract that been consumed in both reactors is reduced to 20%, the carbon mass balance averaged over all steady states increases to 11% excess carbon for the H2-production reactor while the deficiet for the CH4-production reactor reduces to 20%. Although reasonable as a guide, the carbon mass balance is limited for processes using complex media because of the difficulty in analyzing complex carbon sources. Future work could use total carbon analyzers as a means to track carbon flows but this technique offers little insight into the metabolic flows of nutrients and products. Nevertheless, the reasonable accounting of carbon in the H2-production reactor did give confidence in those measurements conducted and presented in this work, and suggests the missing carbon in the methane reactor is a significant observation and not an artifact of poor measurements."
10,"Two-phase integrated bioreactor operations – dilution, feed strength, and C:N ratios","3.2 Two-phase integrated bioreactor operations – dilution, feed strength, and C:N ratios In the integrated, two-phase process, the effluent from the first H2-production reactor was fed into the second CH4-production reactor. The results from the steady state measurements of these experiments are presented in Table 3 , with the head space gas composition data for the entire six months of operations for the two reactors shown in Fig. 2 a and b. To help acclimate the methane producing culture to the new feed, initially only a percentage of the effluent from the H2-production reactor was used, with the remainder made up by standard media (steady states SS1 and SS2, Table 3). After that, the two reactors were fully integrated (steady states SS3, SS4 and SS5 in Table 3). For the H2-production reactor the highest yields (0.2, 0.19, and 0.22mmolmmol−1) were found at feed rates of 2.0, 3.0 and 5.0Ld−1 with H2 headspace compositions ranging between 30.7% and 37.7% and the balance mostly CO2). Statistically significant lower rates were found at feed rates of 4.0 and 6.0Ld−1 (Table 3, Tukey’s pairwise comparison, family error rate of 5%) although the headspace H2 was statistically equivalent to the other steady states at 37% and the balance mostly CO2). The maximum statistically significant gas production rate was 217.95mlh−1 at a feed rate of 5Ld−1 (Table 3, Tukey’s pairwise comparison, family error rate of 5%). For the CH4-production reactor the statistically highest yield was found at the lowest feed rate of 2Ld−1 with statistically lower (but statistically indistinguishable among themselves) yields at the higher feed rates of 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0Ld−1 (Table 3, Tukey’s pairwise comparison, family error rate of 5%). These results demonstrate that two-phase operation can be achieved, with dominance of hydrogen-production and methane-production in their respective reactors, albeit at relatively low yields (based on glucose input). It is observed that the hydrogen yields were generally found to be higher in the integrated process as opposed to the non-integrated process. At first glance this should not happen since both reactors were operated similarly and unaffected by the process of integration (e.g., the reaction of glucose fermentation identical across both processes). Inspection of the data in Tables 1 and 3 reveals that the source of this difference is due to statistically higher gas production rates (mlh−1) at each dilution rate. Otherwise, the physiology of the culture remained statistically similar (i.e., in terms of head space composition of H2 and metabolite profiles at each steady state). In reality, however, the two cultures were distinctly different in terms of age. In our work, the non-integrated cultures were approximately two and half months older than the integrated cultures. Specifically, we elected to first establish the cultures in the non-integrated process to demonstrate proof of principle regarding culture selection for H2 and CH4 production, respectively, in the two bioreactors (i.e., while operated under different selection pressures of pH and dilution rate) before inoculating the integrated bioreactors. In both systems we found that the older H2 producing cultures tended to produce lower overall gas production rates (mlh−1), an observation we attribute to the effects of culture selection and growth of biofilm. That said, we suggest that future work in this area should consider overall gas production rates as a function of culture age, specifically when grown in continuous culture under selective pressures of pH and dilution rate, and that a detailed analysis of species composition and extent of biofilm be measured and directly correlated. The liquid phase metabolites, dominated by lactate, fed from the H2-production reactor to the CH4-production reactor, were mostly consumed with only small amounts of mostly indistinguishable acetate, acetoin, and butyrate unconsumed (Table 3, Tukey’s pairwise comparison, family error rate of 5%). The methane to glucose yields were again relatively low at 0.27molmol−1 for a feed rate of 5Ld−1, although this was slightly higher than for when fed glucose directly (∼0.22molmol−1, see CH4Rxr, Table 1). As with the H2-production reactor, methane yields and gas production rates were higher for the integrated system relative to the independently operated reactors. Methane yields on glucose were highest for the mixed feed (i.e. 0.57molmol−1 for SS1 and 0.39molmol−1 for SS2) although this could be attributed to the lower feed rates (1 and 2Ld−1). However, even with this increase, overall methane yields were still low. Although not shown, the methane to lactate yields were roughly a bit above half the values calculated for glucose (calculations not shown), which is expected given two acetates are produced per mole of glucose. The response of this two-phase integrated system to increased feed strength (substrate concentrations) and changing C:N ratio was investigated at a constant feed rate of 5Ld−1 (Table 4 ). In the H2-production reactor, the hydrogen per glucose yields were lowest (Table 4, Tukey’s pairwise comparison, family error rate of 5%) at glucose feed levels of 20 and 40gL−1 and with the feed nitrogen remaining at its original level of 1N (C:N of 13.35 and 24.88molmol−1). As the nitrogen was doubled from 1N–2N, however, the yields increased to their statistically highest levels of 0.26 and 0.34mmolmol−1 (Table 4, Tukey’s pairwise comparison, family error rate of 5%). The hydrogen-production rate remained statistically indistinguishable (Table 4, Tukey’s pairwise comparison, family error rate of 5%) as the glucose feed level was increased from 20 to 40gL−1 without an concomitant increase in the nitrogen feed concentration (i.e. the C:N ratio increased from 13.35 to 24.88mol mol−1). However, as the nitrogen feed was doubled (1N–2N) at a glucose feed rate of 40gL−1, the hydrogen-production rate doubled and rose yet again when the glucose concentration was raised from 40 to 60gL−1. The gas production rates statistically decreased from 224 to 135mlh−1 when the glucose was doubled from 20 to 40gL−1 at the lowest fixed feed nitrogen concentration of 1N, but increased significantly to 353 when the feed nitrogen was increased to 2N at 40gL−1 (Table 4, Tukey’s pair wise comparison, family error rate of 5%). These results suggest that the gas production rates are generally higher at lower C:N ratios, and when H2 and CO2 are the dominant headspace gases. Lactate, which was present at each steady state, did not increase much when the glucose was doubled without a similar increase in nitrogen (SS6 to SS7: glucose 40gL−1, 1N, C:N 24.88molmol−1) but doubled when the nitrogen was likewise doubled (SS7 to SS8: glucose 40 g L−1, 2N, C:N 13.35molmol−1, Tukey’s pairwise comparison, family error rate of 5%). All other metabolites were generally low except for acetate which was significantly highest at SS7 (glucose 40gL−1, C:N 24.88) and butyrate which generally increased with each increase in glucose or nitrogen (Table 4, Tukey’s pairwise comparison, family error rate of 5%). In the CH4-production reactor the methane to glucose yield was statistically highest at the lowest feed glucose and nitrogen feed concentrations (SS6, glucose 20gL−1, nitrogen 1N). Thereafter, the yields decreased to and remained at indistinguishably low levels (∼0.05mmol mmol−1) with each subsequent increase in feed glucose or nitrogen (Table 4, Tukey’s pairwise comparison, family error rate of 5%). The overall gas production rate statistically increased when the glucose was increased from 20 to 40gL−1 at 1N, and then dramatically tripled from 277 to 867mlh−1 when the nitrogen was doubled from 1N to 2N with the feed glucose at 40 gl−1 (Table 4, Tukey’s pair wise comparison, family error rate of 5%). The following increase in feed glucose from 40 to 60gL−1 did not significantly increase the total gas production rate (Tukey’s pairwise comparison, family error rate of 5%). The methane-production rates were generally indistinguishable at ∼4 to 5mmolL−1 d−1 except at SS8 (feed glucose of 40gL−1 and nitrogen at 2N) where its value was significantly higher at 13mmolL−1 d−1. The head space methane composition declined when the glucose was doubled from 20 to 40 and from 40 to 60 without a change in nitrogen (SS6 to SS7, and SS8 to SS9), suggesting that increasing the feed C:N ratio depresses methane-production and stimulates hydrogen-production (substantial amounts of hydrogen and lactate appeared at the highest organic loading (SS9: glucose 60gL−1, 2N, C:N 19.11 mol mol−1)). Lactate levels were otherwise not statistically significant although acetate and butyrate levels were present at reasonable concentrations (e.g., between 2.5 and 6.0gL−1) at all steady states. Increases in glucose tended to destabilize the two phase system, as could be seen from the emergence of H2 in the methane reactor head space, but which could generally be arrested by the concomitant increase in the nitrogen source (e.g., peptone and yeast extract). However, once a glucose feed load of 60gL−1 was reached, the system began to crash without opportunity for increased nitrogen to stabilize the system. This result suggests that although the two-phase system can be used to select for CH4 producers in the second reactor, even though the H2 producers are present at sufficiently high organic loadings, can quickly dominate the culture. This result is emphasized in Fig. 3 which presents the batch growth of the methane producers after two thirds of the CH4-production reactor media was emptied and replaced with standard media that had been refrigerated overnight. Prior to this experiment, the CH4-production reactor had been run at conditions that had optimized for methane producers and possessed the expected head space gas composition profile (e.g., CH4 ∼50% with the balance as CO2). The results clearly show that despite the initial domination of methane producers, in the presence of excess organic feed (e.g. glucose) the background hydrogen producers quickly dominate, with the majority of head space gas being composed of hydrogen and carbon dioxide, with the balance being methane."
11,Conclusions,"We have shown that the selection pressure of pH and dilution rate is sufficient to select for acetogenic and methanogenic bacteria in their respective first and second phases. The percentage of hydrogen in the head space of the first reactor was between 30% and 40% when fed standard media, regardless of varying dilution rates. The same results in terms of H2-production were obtained, for both individual vs. tandem operations, as expected since these did not differ for the first stage operations, demonstrating the results reinforce the reproducibility across all experiments. The predominant product of glucose metabolism in the H2-production reactor was lactate, regardless of the dilution rate. Dominance of lactic acid bacteria in this reactor, accounted for the relatively low H2 yields and rates observer, compared to what has been observed with clostridia dominated cultures. In some sense lactate (and acetoin) are stealing electrons away from H2-production, and that redirecting metabolism away from these end products would theoretically improve H2-production. Some insight to this can be seen by inspecting the hydrogen yield on the basis of glucose that was converted to products other than lactate and acetoin. For Table 1 these yields varied from 0.6 to 2.0mmolmmol−1 (calculations not shown). The lactate was effectively consumed in the second reactor, for most dilutions and organic loadings, but overall yields of methane were relatively low. Composition of liquid phase metabolites were fairly constant across all dilution rates, suggesting that the methanotrophs in the second reactor acted like a typical anaerobic digestor. However, the integrated two-phase system, at all dilution rates, improved yields and CH4-production rates. What two-stage integration did not provide, however, was an accelerated metabolism in the second reactor that would support the use of shorter retention times. It was hoped that such a separation would permit the use of smaller second stage reactors and shorten the overall processing time, both of which would improve the cost of application in industry. These results, however, indicate that this advantage was not achieved with respect to methane-production in the second reactor, regardless of the presence of lactate from the first reactor. In the non-integrated system a sharp decline in methane-production in the CH4-production reactor was observed when the feed rate was raised from 5 to 6Ld−1. This decline was accompanied by a increase in hydrogen-production, suggesting that at higher dilution rates, and in the presence of glucose feed, the hydrogen producing bacteria begin to dominate the slower growing methanogens. By contrast, in the integrated two-phase system, the steady diet of low energy organic acids from the first hydrogen producing reactor maintained a selective pressure in favor of the methanotrophs. This was also seen at the highest dilution rates, where in the non-integrated system fed glucose, methane yields dropped dramatically vs. constant methane yields in the integrated system. The effect of increasing the carbon and/or nitrogen concentrations in the feed media had the effect of increasing the overall gas production rates in both reactors. However increasing glucose relative to nitrogen (e.g., increasing the C:N ratio) generally had the effect of destabilizing the second CH4-production reactor. The general effect was to first increase the biomass concentration in the first reactor, which resulted in more acetogenic bacteria pumped into the second CH4-production reactor, along with a greater concentration of lactate. Consequently, acetogens in the second CH4-production reactor eventually dominate the slower growing methanogens. This left the two-phase system somewhat vulnerable to disturbances. Typical disturbances could include a brief over pumping of media from the first H2-production reactor into the second due to problems with the level control (due to foaming), pH control in the second CH4-production reactor due to periodic loss of mixing (i.e. if the stirrer bar was pushed to the side) or appearance of foaming. In summary, two-phase operation for the production of H2 and CH4 mixtures can be achieved with appropriate application of selection pressure through pH and dilution rate, and at low organic loadings. The process promises low H2 and CH4 yields (relative to glucose) at industrial scale unless energy efficient techniques are found to inhibit the introduction of lactic acid producing bacteria in the first H2-production reactor, to provide good mixing, and to decrease the liquid side partial pressure of H2. While these items should be the focus of future research, a few comments are provided. While increasing the gas transfer coefficient (e.g., through increased mixing) to reduce the liquid-side hydrogen partial pressure in the reactors could also be advantageous, it was not applied in this work because its application is not practical at industry scale due to its high energy requirements. Displacement of lactic acid producing bacteria will require additional process methodologies such as sterilization of the feed or the use of repetitive batch innoculations with desired H2 producers, something that will need to be addressed in industrial application. In our application of this strategy, however, we found that, at pH 5.5, the lactic acid bacteria still dominated and lactic acid production proceeded in tandem with glucose utilization and biomass production, and without significant H2- or CO2-production, and that after the glucose was fully consumed, the H2 (and CO2)-production was initiated and continued for some time This suggests a need to re-innoculate with dense cultures of the preferred H2 producing bacteria along with some heat treatment of the pre-existing culture to reduce dominance by lactic acid bacteria."
