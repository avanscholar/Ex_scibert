0,Introduction,"In recent years, global fossil energy consumption has increased and environmental problems have become severe. In order to reduce the use of fossil fuels and reduce environmental pollution, research on alternative energy sources has received increasing attention (Gad and Ismail, 2021; Gong et al., 2019; Zhen and Wang, 2015; Gad et al., 2021). Currently, research on alternative fuels is mainly focused on natural gas (Chen et al., 2020), liquefied petroleum gas (Fermín and David, 2020), hydrogen (Zhen et al., 2020a, 2020b, 2020c; Gong et al., 2020a, 2020b, 2020c, 2020d, 2020e, 2020f), dimethyl ether (Taghavifar et al., 2019) and alcohols (methanol, ethanol, butanol, etc.) (Gong et al., 2020a, 2020b, 2020c, 2020d, 2020e, 2020f; Zhen et al., 2020a, 2020b, 2020c; Chen et al., 2021; Gong et al., 2020a, 2020b, 2020c, 2020d, 2020e, 2020f; Bhowmik et al., 2020; Li et al., 2019a, 2019b; Thakkar et al., 2021; Zhen et al., 2020a, 2020b, 2020c). The main research is the effect of mixing with gasoline, diesel, or the mutual mixing of alternative fuels on the engine (Cai et al., 2021; Shi et al., 2020; Gong et al., 2020a, 2020b, 2020c, 2020d, 2020e, 2020f; Li et al., 2020a, 2020b; Shen et al., 2021; Shirneshan et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2020a, 2020b). Among them, hydrogen has been studied by more and more people as a renewable clean energy (Ji et al., 2021). Hydrogen is easily ignited and the flame spreads quickly, which is essential for the engine to improve combustion efficiency (Yu et al., 2017). Hydrogen itself has no carbon atoms, which can solve CO and CO2 emissions from the source (Li et al., 2020a, 2020b). Therefore, hydrogen has attracted the attention of researchers. However, the standard volume of pure hydrogen has a low calorific value, and the addition of a high proportion of hydrogen to a gasoline engine or the use of pure hydrogen will cause the engine's power to drop. (Navale et al., 2017; Dimitriou and Tsujimura, 2017). In addition, the current cost of producing hydrogen is very high, critical storage and transportation are extremely difficult and there is a high risk, which is fatal to the development of hydrogen. However, the use of a small amount of hydrogen mixed with conventional fuels not only exerts the advantages of hydrogen, but also can better avoid the defects of hydrogen itself (Yang and Ji, 2018). Hydrogen is a clean energy that is used in SI engines to improve the combustion process and reduce emissions and fuel consumption (Shi et al., 2021a, 2021b; Verhelst and Wallner, 2009; Shi et al., 2021a, 2021b). The combustion and emission characteristics of the hydrogen added to gasoline engines have been paid attention to by scientific researchers. Karagöz et al. (2019) found that hydrogen running in a SI engine resulted in lower BP and BT compared to pure gasoline. NOx emissions increased, but fuel consumption, CO and HC emissions were decreased. Yu et al. (2019a), 2019b analyzed hydrogen-gasoline dual injection and EGR on engine performance under lean burn conditions. They found that the addition of hydrogen increased BMEP and reduced CO and HC emissions of the engine, but NOx emissions significantly increased. Shivaprasad et al. (2014) showed that the addition of hydrogen improved the combustion process and BTE, reduced the BSFC and the BMEP. In addition, hydrogenation effectively reduced HC and CO emissions. Zhao et al. (2020) found that hydrogen significantly shortened the initial development time and rapid burning time of the flame. After hydrogen was added, the HC emissions of iso-butanol gasoline were significantly reduced, and the CO emissions were slightly reduced. Wang et al. (2014a), 2014b studied hydrogen-mixed gasoline engines under heavy load conditions. The results demonstrated that compared to pure gasoline, 3% hydrogen was added to gasoline to improve BTE. This was mainly due to reduced throttling losses and residual gas fraction. Combustion of the 3% hydrogen-gasoline mixture in the engine reduced CO and NOx emissions under lean conditions. Amrouche et al. (2014) explored performance of hydrogen-enriched gasoline in a rotary engine through experiments. The results confirmed that adding hydrogen to gasoline improved the thermal efficiency and power. HC and CO decreased, while NOx emissions increased with the increase in hydrogen composition. Wang et al. (2014a), 2014b demonstrated that adding hydrogen to gasoline improved the thermal efficiency and shortened the development and propagation time of the flame. After hydrogen blending, CO and HC emissions were reduced. Yu et al. (2019a), 2019b found that compared with pure gasoline, the addition of hydrogen stabilized ignition and accelerated the combustion rate to improve thermal efficiency under lean burn conditions. In addition, due to more complete combustion, CO and HC emissions were reduced. But because the combustion temperature was higher, more NOx emissions were produced. Karagöz et al. (2015) demonstrated that as the hydrogen fraction increased, the BTE and Tmax of the engine increased. BSFC, HC and CO emissions reduced, but NOx increased. Du et al. (2016) found that the hydrogen fraction increased, the burning rate increased, BMEP and BTE were improved. In addition, the Pmax increased and its corresponding crank angle position was advanced, Tmax and the MRPR increased. The direct injection of hydrogen into the gasoline engine suppressed the formation of HC and CO, but it promoted the increase of NOx emissions. Ji et al. (2016) found that the Pmax, BMEP, Tmax and BTE were increased after adding hydrogen. The crank angle position of Pmax was advanced as the hydrogen content increases. The addition of hydrogen effectively shortened development and propagation time of the flame. The emission of HC, CO and CO2 with the addition of hydrogen was also reduced. Niu et al. (2016) showed that after the adding hydrogen, the flame development and burning time were shortened. The Pmax and heat release rate increased as the proportion of hydrogen increased. With the addition of hydrogen, CO and HC emissions reduced, but NOx production was increased. The mixing of hydrogen with other fuels has also been paid attention to by some scholars. There are mainly effects of mixing hydrogen with methanol, ethanol, butanol and natural gas on engine performance (Gong et al., 2020a, 2020b, 2020c, 2020d, 2020e, 2020f; Heng et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). Gong et al. (2020a), 2020b, 2020c, 2020d, 2020e, 2020f found that adding hydrogen to methanol accelerated the flame propagation speed and shortened the combustion duration. Yu et al. (2020) found that hydrogen optimized Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol combustion, reduced CO emissions, and improved engine power and economy. Meng et al. (2021) found that adding hydrogen to a butanol engine reduced CO and HC emissions, and shortened ignition delay and combustion duration. Leng et al. (2021) found that adding hydrogen to natural gas reduced BSFC, CO and HC emissions, but NOx emissions were increased. Since the density of hydrogen is very low (see in Table 2), which makes storage and transportation difficult, in addition, hydrogen production is expensive. Therefore, there is a certain difficulty in using hydrogen alone as a fuel at this stage. However, we can introduce a small amount of hydrogen into a gasoline engine. Add a small amount of hydrogen to the gasoline engine consumes less hydrogen, which can effectively solve a series of problems such as hydrogen supply and storage. At the same time, adding a low proportion of hydrogen does not require major modifications to the gasoline engine, which can save a lot of cost (Yu et al., 2017). Therefore, it is currently a good method to introducing a small proportion of hydrogen into gasoline engines. Researchers have conducted some research on adding hydrogen to gasoline engines. However, there is a blank in the research on the combination of a small proportion of hydrogen and flame kernel radius to improve the performance of gasoline engines. Therefore, this article conducts in-depth exploration and research on the existing vacancies."
1,Numerical method,"GT-Power is highly recognized by the engine industry due to its high simulation accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, the model of adding hydrogen to direct injection engine is established by using this software (Tian et al., 2020a, 2020b)."
2,Engine specifications,"2.1 Engine specifications Hydrogen is a flammable and explosive gas. Using simulation models to study the performance of hydrogen in the engine can effectively reduce the risk of the experiment, but the model must be checked. This paper verifies the reliability of the model through experiments with Li et al. (2019a), 2019b and Du et al. (2017). The engine used in this paper is the same as the engine of Li et al. (2019a), 2019b and Du et al. (2017). Engine specifications are shown in Table 1 ."
3,Model establishment,"2.2 Model establishment Hydrogen is a green sustainable energy source. If hydrogen can be reasonably applied to internal combustion engines, it will certainly drive changes in the energy and engine industries. Establishing a model with high simulation accuracy is the premise for studying the mixing of hydrogen and gasoline. A hydrogen-gasoline dual-fuel 1-D engine simulation model is established by GT-Power software. The model has passed reasonable assumptions and analyzed the influence of hydrogen ratio and FKR on engine combustion and emissions. The 1-D engine model is mainly composed of intake system, cylinder, injector, ignition system, exhaust system and EGR system. In practice, the engine speed and load are constantly changing, which causes the gas flow in the engine pipeline to not be in a stable state. However, in order to use GT-Power software to simulate engine operation, the gas flow in the pipeline can be regarded as a one-dimensional unsteady flow. In other words, at a certain moment, in any plane perpendicular to the x-axis, the velocity and thermodynamic parameters of the gas are constant. In this paper, the finite volume method is used to establish the one-dimensional unsteady flow equation of the engine intake and exhaust to simulate the gas flow in the intake and exhaust system (Souzaa et al., 2019). This method has high calculation accuracy and relatively stable solution process, which has been widely used. In simulating the combustion process of the mixed gas in the cylinder of the engine, the partitioned (unburned area and burned area) combustion model is used for simulation analysis, and the fractal method is used to calculate the combustion rate (Bellis et al., 2017). This model can better identify the combustion system and variables, such as the temperature and pressure in the cylinder, the ignition timing and the mixture concentration (Tian et al., 2020a, 2020b). The heat exchange of the engine mainly occurs on the top surface of the piston, the bottom surface of the cylinder head and the surface of the cylinder liner. The exchange of heat generated by the combustion of mixture in the cylinder with the external environment can not only reflect the heat dissipation ability of the engine, but also have a certain influence on the thermal efficiency. The Woschni heat transfer model is widely used in engine simulation calculations (Woschni, 1976). Therefore, this paper uses the Woschni heat transfer model to calculate heat exchange. In the article published by the author (Tian et al., 2020a, 2020b), the establishment steps of the one-dimensional engine model are described in great detail. Fig. 1 shows the engine model."
4,Fuel,"2.3 Fuel In this paper, four kinds of fuels were simulated by 1-D simulation model, namely pure gasoline, hydrogen volume fraction of 1%, 2% and 3% hydrogen blended gasoline. Table 2 shows the properties of hydrogen and gasoline."
5,Boundary operating conditions,"2.4 Boundary operating conditions The throttle is fully open, and two speeds of 1500 rpm and 2000 rpm are set under the condition. Keep the other conditions constant and test the effect of low proportions of hydrogen and the FKR on engine performance. Table 3 shows the operating condition parameters."
6,Model validation,"To make the simulation of the model more accurate, we need to verify the model. The model calculation results are compared with the experimental results of Li et al. (2019a), 2019b and Du et al. (2017). Fig. 2 (a) shows the simulated pressure versus the pressure of Li et al. (2019a), 2019b using pure gasoline as fuel. The two curves agree well, and the difference between simulation and experiment is 4.15 %, which can meet the simulation requirements. The simulated pressure is compared with the in-cylinder pressure of Du et al. (2017) using a 5% hydrogen gasoline blended fuel, as shown in Fig. 2(b). Observing the two pressure lines, it can be found that they are basically coincident, and the maximum pressure difference is 1.22 %, which indicates that the simulation accuracy of the model is high. We can use this model to study the combustion and emission characteristics of a low proportion of hydrogen added to a gasoline engine. The pressure in the cylinder calculated by simulation is slightly greater than the measured pressure, which may be due to insufficient consideration of heat dissipation and friction in the model (Tian et al., 2020a, 2020b). Table 4 shows intuitively that the difference between the model and the experiment is small."
7,Results,
8,Combustion analysis,"4.1 Combustion analysis BP diagrams of the engine at a speed of 1500 rpm and 2000 rpm are shown in Fig. 3 (a) and (b). When the engine speed is 1500 rpm, as the hydrogen ratio increases, the BP first increases and then decreases. When the engine speed is 2000 rpm, the BP increases with increasing hydrogen content (Meng et al., 2018). Yu et al. (2017) proved that adding hydrogen to a gasoline engine improved engine power by 10 % and BTE by 4.5 %.When FKR is 0.5 mm, the BP of adding 3% hydrogen is increased by 1.3 % compared with pure gasoline. Fig. 3(c) and (d) are the BT diagrams of the engine at a speed of 1500 rpm and 2000 rpm, respectively. The trend of BT change is basically consistent with the trend of BP change. Du et al. (2017) also demonstrated that adding hydrogen in gasoline can increase torque through experiments. The main reason is: first of all, the minimum ignition energy of hydrogen is only one-twelfth of gasoline, and the diffusion coefficient is about 12 times that of gasoline (see in Table 2), which makes the combustion rate of the mixture faster (Wang et al., 2014a, 2014b). The rapid combustion of hydrogen will make the combustion of gasoline more complete, the CHR, BMEP, Pmax and MRPR of the engine will increase. As a result, BP and BT also increase. Secondly, the quenching distance of hydrogen is shorter, about 1/3 of that of gasoline. The smaller quenching distance can make the flame spread close to the cylinder wall, and even reach the piston clearance. The mixture entering into the gap between piston ring and cylinder wall will be ignited, making the combustion more complete. Therefore, BT and BP also increase. Finally, The laminar flame speed of hydrogen is about 4.6 times that of gasoline, which makes the flame spread of hydrogen faster than gasoline (Du et al., 2016), which makes hydrogen combustion closer to the ideal isometric thermodynamic cycle, combustion is more complete, and the piston does more work. Therefore, the engine outputs more power and torque. As FKR increases, the BP and BT gradually decrease. Mainly with the increase of FKR, LFS increases, which leads to ignition delay, combustion delay and 10–90 % MFB shortening. Moreover, the crankshaft angle corresponding to the Pmax in the cylinder is advanced, and the compression negative work done by the piston is increased, which causes the BP and BT to decline. No matter the engine speed is 1500 rpm or 2000 rpm, when the FKR is 0.5 mm, the engine power performance is the best. However, at 1500 rpm, adding 2% hydrogen can make the engine power the best. Adding 3% hydrogen can make the engine power the best at 2000 rpm. BSFC can reflect the fuel economy of the engine (Meng et al., 2018). Fig. 4 (a) and (b) show BSFC of the engine as a function of the flame kernel radius for 1500 rpm and 2000 rpm. It can be seen from the Figure that as the proportion of hydrogen increases, the BSFC decreases (Karagöz et al., 2019). When FKR is 0.5 mm and the engine speed is 2000 rpm, the BSFC of the engine can be reduced by up to 4.29 %. The proportion of hydrogen increases, which increases the volumetric efficiency (see in Fig. 5 ) of the engine, so the air entering the engine increases and the combustion is more sufficient. At the same time, the hydrogen ignition energy is low and the flame propagation speed is fast (Karagöz et al., 2015), so that the mixture burns more fully. Therefore, less fuel is required in the case of outputting the same torque. As FKR increases, the BSFC increases. As FKR increases, the mixture is easier to ignite, the flame spreads faster, and more mixture is ignited before compression top dead center. When the same torque is output, more fuel combustion is needed to overcome the compression negative work. Therefore, the BSFC increases. Fig. 4(c) and (d) show the CHR of the engine as a function of the flame kernel radius at 1500 rpm and 2000 rpm. Adding hydrogen to the engine can increase the CHR of the engine. The mainly hydrogen has lower ignition energy and is easy to be ignited, and the flame spreads faster (Karagöz et al., 2015), which causes the mixture to burn sufficiently and release more heat. When the speed is 1500 rpm, adding 2% hydrogen to the gasoline engine has the maximum CHR. When the speed is 2000 rpm, adding 3% hydrogen to the gasoline engine has the maximum CHR. Therefore, under different speed conditions, the proportion of hydrogen should be reasonably controlled to make the engine performance better. The change of engine speed can cause the change of air intake. When the engine is at a low speed, the air entering the cylinder is reduced. This is well demonstrated in the comparison of Fig. 5(a) and (b). Since the theoretical air-fuel ratio of hydrogen is relatively large, adding too much hydrogen will cause the mixture to become thinner and the combustion will be insufficient, which will lead to the reduction of heat release. Therefore, it is necessary to add different proportions of hydrogen at different speeds. As FKR increases, the CHR continues to decrease. The FKR increases, the crankshaft angle corresponding to the Pmax of the engine is advanced, the compression negative work is increased, and the heat released by mixed gas combustion has more part to offset the negative compression work, so the CHR is reduced. VE can indicate how much air or mixture enters the engine (Li et al., 2019a, 2019b). As shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), the volumetric efficiency increases as the proportion of hydrogen increases. This is closely related to hydrogen air-fuel ratio. When the Lambda is set the same, the proportion of hydrogen increases, the amount of air required also increases, the amount of air entering the cylinder increases, and the VE increases. In addition, this also proves the feasibility of the analysis of the results of Fig. 4. The improvement of VE is of great significance for improving engine power and reducing fuel consumption. Pmax is an important characteristic that directly affects performance and emissions (Shi et al., 2017). Fig. 6 (a) and (b) show Pmax of the engine as a function of the flame kernel radius for 1500 rpm and 2000 rpm. As the proportion of hydrogen increases, the Pmax increases. Shi et al. (2017) proved through experiments that the Pmax in the cylinder increases with the increase of hydrogen proportion. Adding hydrogen to the gasoline promotes the combustion speed of the mixed gas and improves the combustion efficiency. The combustion of the mixture in the cylinder is more complete, so the Pmax increases. As FKR increases, the Pmax also increases. The increase of FKR will accelerate LFS of the mixture, the mixed gas burns more fully, the combustion duration is shortened, and the crankshaft angle corresponding to the Pmax is closer to the compression top dead center, so the cylinder pressure is also higher. As shown in Fig. 6(c) and (d), as the proportion of hydrogen increases, the crankshaft angle corresponding to the Pmax in the cylinder is continuously decreasing. It shows that the combustion rate of the mixture in the cylinder increases with the increase of the proportion of hydrogen. It is precisely because the addition of hydrogen can advance the crankshaft angle corresponding to the maximum pressure so that the heat released by the combustion of the mixture is converted into effective work, the engine power is more abundant, and the fuel consumption and emissions are also reduced. Gong et al. (2020a), 2020b, 2020c, 2020d, 2020e, 2020f proved that the addition of hydrogen to methanol increased the pressure in the cylinder, and the crankshaft angle corresponding to the Pmax was advanced. As the FKR increases, the crankshaft angle corresponding to the Pmax in the engine cylinder is also decreasing. The increase of the proportion of hydrogen and the FKR can accelerate LFS of the mixture, which causes the combustion delay and 10–90 % MFB to be shortened, so that the crankshaft angle corresponding to the Pmax is advanced. The crankshaft angle corresponding to the Pmax is close to the top dead center to improve the engine power, but the crankshaft angle too close to the top dead center will cause the negative work of the piston to increase in the early stage of combustion, which is prone to knocking. BMEP refers to the effective work produced by a cycle of unit cylinder working volume of the engine, which reflects the output torque of unit cylinder working volume of the engine (Shivaprasad et al., 2014). The larger the BMEP is, the more work is output from the engine cylinder working volume. Fig. 7 (a) and (b) show the BMEP as a function of FKR at 1500 rpm and 2000 rpm. Fig. 7(a) and (b) are basically consistent with the trends in Fig. 3(c) and (d), which also demonstrates a close relationship between BMEP and engine torque. The BMEP increases as the proportion of hydrogen increases at 2000 rpm (Shivaprasad et al., 2014). Yu et al. (2019a), 2019b found that introducing hydrogen into gasoline could improve BMEP. Maximum rate of pressure rise characterizes engine operating conditions, vibration and noise levels (Heywood, 1988). The higher the MRPR is, the closer the maximum combustion pressure occurs to the top dead center, and the power and economy of the gasoline engine are better. However, too high MRPR will also cause an increase in NOx emissions. As shown in Fig. 7(c) and (d), as the proportion of hydrogen and the FKR increase, the MRPR also increases. The mainly the increase of hydrogen ratio and the FKR will increase the Pmax, and the crankshaft angle corresponding to the Pmax is closer to the top dead center. Therefore, MRPR also rises. In addition, the addition of hydrogen and the increase of the FKR can accelerate combustion, the mixture burns more fully, so the MRPR is also increased. It has also been shown in the literature (Shi et al., 2017) that MRPR increases with the increase in the proportion of hydrogen. With the increase of FKR, MRPR increased, but the power and torque of the engine decreased, and BSFC increased, which indicated that the mixture in the cylinder burned violently and the knocking occurred. Fig. 8 (a) and (b) show the Tmax as a function of the flame kernel radius for 1500 rpm and 2000 rpm. The Tmax increases as the proportion of hydrogen increases (Su et al., 2017a, 2017b, 2017c). The is due to the lower ignition energy of hydrogen and the faster flame propagation speed (see in Table 2) lead to more complete combustion of the mixture, more heat is released, and the Tmax also increases (Su et al., 2017a, 2017b, 2017c; Zhao et al., 2010). The increase of temperature is beneficial to improve the dynamic performance of the engine. As FKR increases, the Tmax also increases. The main is due to the increase in the FKR leads to an increase in the LFS of the mixture, which makes the combustion of the mixture more complete and the heat release increases, so the Tmax in the cylinder also increases. Fig. 8(c) and (d) show the relationship between the EGT and the flame kernel radius at 1500 rpm and 2000 rpm. The engine's EGT first increases and then decreases with the increase of the hydrogen ratio at 1500 rpm. At the speed of 2000 rpm, as the proportion of hydrogen increases, the EGT gradually decreases (Manigandan et al., 2019). The main is due to the LFS of the mixture is increased after the addition of hydrogen, the combustion duration is shortened, in the later stage, the reduction of fuel causes a reduction in heat release, and the EGT is also lowered. As FKR increases, the EGT also decreases. The increase of FKR leads to the increase of LFS and the advance of combustion phase. The mixture burns faster so that most of the fuel burns in the rapid combustion phase. At the end of combustion, less fuel remains in the cylinder, and the heat released is reduced (Tian et al., 2020a, 2020b), so the EGT is lowered. MFB is a standardized measurement of the fraction of chemical energy released from burning fuel (Amrouche et al., 2018). Fig. 9 (a) and (b) show the MFB as a function of the flame kernel radius for 1500 rpm and 2000 rpm. MFB also increases with the increase of hydrogen content (Sun et al., 2018). It shows that the addition of hydrogen makes the mixture burn more fully. The increase of the FKR causes the decrease of BMF, which is related to the knocking of the mixed gas combustion in the cylinder. Fig. 9(c) and (d) show the LFS of the engine as a function of the flame kernel radius for 1500 rpm and 2000 rpm. As the proportion of hydrogen increases, the LFS also increases. The LFS of hydrogen is larger than that of gasoline, which is about 7 times that of gasoline. Therefore, hydrogen is added to the engine to accelerate the LFS of the mixture (Amrouche et al., 2018). As the FKR increases, the LFS also increases. Mainly the FKR increases and the flame spread faster per unit time, so the LFS also increases. It can be seen from Figs. 10 and 11 that the ignition delay, combustion delay and 10–90 % MFB decrease, which better illustrates the faster flame propagation speed. Fig. 10(a) and (b) are graphs showing the ignition delay as a function of hydrogen ratio at 1500 rpm and 2000 rpm. It can be seen from Fig. 10(a) and (b) that as the hydrogen ratio and the FKR increase, the ignition delay decreases. It is closely related to the faster of LFS. Fig. 10(c) and (d) are plots of combustion delay as a function of hydrogen ratio at 1500 rpm and 2000 rpm. As the hydrogen ratio and FKR increase, the combustion delay decreases. The main is due to the LFS of hydrogen is larger than that of gasoline (see in Table 2), and the LFS also increases as the FKR increases. The burning speed of the mixture is accelerated. Therefore, the increase of hydrogen ratio and FKR will lead to a reduction in combustion delay. Appropriate reduction of ignition delay and combustion delay can improve engine performance, but too much reduction will cause the engine to operate rudely. The combustion duration is calculated from the difference between the 90 % and 10 % mass combustion fraction crankshaft angle time (Singh et al., 2015). Fig. 11(a) and (b) are plots of 10–90 % MFB as a function of hydrogen ratio at 1500 rpm and 2000 rpm. As the hydrogen ratio and FKR increase, 10–90 % MFB decreases (Su et al., 2017a, 2017b, 2017c). The introduction of hydrogen and the increase of the FKR will increase the LFS, the burning speed of the mixture will increase, and the combustion duration will be shortened (Ji et al., 2018). Therefore, 10–90 % MFB is shortened. Gong et al. (2020a), 2020b, 2020c, 2020d, 2020e, 2020f found that adding 3% hydrogen to methanol accelerated flame propagation and shortened the combustion duration. The increase of FKR from 0.5 mm to 2.5 mm significantly shortens 10–90 % MFB. Combining ignition delay and combustion delay, it can be seen that more air-fuel mixture burns before top dead center, which leads to more intense air-fuel mixture combustion and reduced engine performance."
9,emission analysis,"4.2 emission analysis Fig. 12 (a) and (b) are plots of HC emissions as a function of FKR at 1500 rpm and 2000 rpm. As the proportion of hydrogen increases, HC emissions also increase. Wang et al. (2014a), 2014b also demonstrated that adding 3% hydrogen to gasoline increased HC emissions at full load. The main reason is that the air-fuel ratio of hydrogen is larger than that of gasoline (see in Table 2). After the addition of hydrogen, the air-fuel ratio of the mixture becomes larger. After the same fuel is injected into the cylinder, the mixture becomes relatively lean, and the combustion is insufficient to cause an increase in HC emissions. In addition, the EGT decreases after the addition of hydrogen, which hinders the oxidation of HC. Therefore, HC emissions also increase. Fig. 12(c) and (d) are plots of NOx emissions as a function of FKR at 1500 rpm and 2000 rpm. It is generally believed that the main component of NOx is NO. The production of NO is related to temperature, oxygen concentration and reaction time (Shi et al., 2017; Tian et al., 2020a, 2020b). At high temperatures, the rate of NO formation is accelerated. Especially when the oxygen content is high, the production rate of NO is faster. In addition, the reaction time also affects the production of NO, and shortening the reaction time can suppress the production of NO (Tian et al., 2020a, 2020b). The increase of hydrogen in the mixed gas will lead to the increase of NOx emissions (Ozcanli et al., 2018). There are two main reasons: first, the addition of hydrogen causes the combustion temperature to increase (Su et al., 2017a, 2017b, 2017c), and the concentration of NO in the reaction increases after the temperature rises, and the NO generation rate also increases. Then, the air-fuel ratio of hydrogen is relatively large (see in Table 2). The addition of hydrogen increases the amount of air entering the cylinder, which makes the oxygen in the cylinder sufficient. Oxygen enrichment promotes the formation of NOx at high temperature conditions (Yang et al., 2017). Therefore, the introduction of hydrogen into gasoline engines increases NOx emissions. Fig. 13 (a) and (b) show the CO emissions as a function of FKR for 1500 rpm and 2000 rpm. The CO emissions of the engine are mainly caused by incomplete combustion of the mixture (Elsemary et al., 2017). As the proportion of hydrogen increases, CO emissions gradually decrease (Shi et al., 2017; White et al., 2006). Yu et al. (2019a), 2019b confirmed that hydrogenation in gasoline stabilized ignition and reduced CO emissions. Li et al. (2020a), 2020b also proved this point. There are three main reasons: first of all, the theoretical air-fuel ratio of hydrogen is relatively large. After the addition of hydrogen, the oxygen required for the mixture increases, the intake air increases, the oxygen in the cylinder is relatively sufficient (Ceviz et al., 2012). Therefore, the CO generation decreases after combustion of the mixture (Su et al., 2017a, 2017b, 2017c). Secondly, the LFS of hydrogen is relatively fast. After the introduction of hydrogen, the combustion rate of the mixture will also be accelerated, the mixture in the cylinder burns quite fully, and the CO emissions are reduced (Shivaprasad et al., 2014). Finally, after the introduction of hydrogen, the carbon content in the mixture is reduced (Su et al., 2017a, 2017b, 2017c), so CO emissions are also reduced. The CO emissions will increase slightly as the FKR increases after the addition of hydrogen at 1500 rpm. Adding hydrogen and increasing the FKR will increase the LFS. The air entering the engine is less at low speeds, the mixture is relatively rich (Tian et al., 2020a, 2020b), and the LFS speed is too fast, which makes the combustion process insufficient, so the CO emissions will increase. The CO emissions decrease as the FKR increases after the addition of hydrogen at 2000 rpm. The main is due to the engine speed is relatively high at this time, and the fresh air entering the engine is relatively more. In addition, the increase of the FKR will accelerate the LFS, the mixed gas burns relatively well. Therefore, the CO emissions are gradually reduced. Fig. 13(c) and (d) are plots of CO2 emissions as a function of FKR at 1500 rpm and 2000 rpm. As the proportion of hydrogen increases, CO2 emissions gradually decrease (Kim et al., 2017; Su et al., 2017a, 2017b, 2017c). The main reason is that hydrogen does not contain carbon. When hydrogen is added to gasoline, the carbon content of the mixture is reduced (Yang and Ji, 2018), so CO2 emissions are also reduced."
10,Conclusion,"In this paper, a 1-D model is established by fractal method. The effects of low proportion of hydrogen and FKR on the combustion and emission characteristics of a GDI engine are analyzed by a 1-D model. Through the analysis of the above results, we can summarize the following conclusions: (1) Compared with pure gasoline, adding a low proportion of hydrogen in a gasoline engine can increase the BP and BT of the engine. However, increasing FKR will adversely affect engine power performance. (2) From the perspective of fuel economy, introducing a small proportion of hydrogen into the gasoline engine can reduce BSFC. However, the increase of FKR makes the BSFC increase. (3) In terms of exhaust emissions, adding hydrogen can effectively reduce engine CO and CO2 emissions, but HC and NOx emissions will increase. (4) The combination of a low proportion of hydrogen and a small FKR can improve the combustion process, increase BP and BT, and reduce BSFC, which opens up new avenues for researching more energy-efficient engines. In short, there are still many problems in using hydrogen as a fuel in internal combustion engines. However, the introduction of a small amount of hydrogen into gasoline engines is still relatively reliable. In the future, the hydrogen production technology is mature and the cost is reduced, and safer storage and transportation methods can be found. Hydrogen energy will surely bring about huge changes in internal combustion engines and energy sources. Provide a way forward for mankind to explore the path of sustainable development."
