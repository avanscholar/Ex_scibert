0,Introduction,"Hydrogen at present is produced mainly from natural gas reforming and coal gasification, with a small share from electrolysis of water. The major applications of hydrogen are in synthesis of various chemicals such as ammonia, methanol and use in oil refineries to convert crude oil to lighter fractions [1]. However in future, hydrogen will also play a significant role as a clean energy carrier and storage media. It can be generated in most corners of the world with renewable energy thus reducing energy dependency on fossil fuels. Furthermore, due to worldwide health concerns over global warming and increasing pollution in industrialized countries binding agreements have been signed by various countries at the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris (COP 21) to reduce pollutant and CO2 emissions [2]. Hydrogen, when utilized in a fuel cell for stationary, distributed or transport applications, offers high efficiency, zero CO2 emissions and produces no pollutant gases at the point of use [1,3]. Water electrolysis, via electrocatalytic splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen using polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) or alkaline solutions has long been considered a promising method for pure hydrogen production and the technology is reaching commercial maturity. However, water electrolysis is highly energy and greenhouse gas intensive unless integrated to a renewable energy source (e.g. solar photovoltaic, wind, or tidal/wave generators). For example, in a PEM-based electrolyzer for one m3 of hydrogen generated, the power consumption is over 4.2 kWh for the stack and over 6 kWh for the complete system, due to the high over potential losses and sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [1,4]. This is despite the use precious metal catalysts (Pt, Ru and Ir) and high catalyst loading. The water electrolyzer integrated to a renewable source of energy can reduce the cost of hydrogen production to US$ 3.7 to 5.8kg−1, however, these costs are still very high for commercialization of the technology [5]. The availability (specific to site) and intermittency of renewable energy make it imperative to store energy in useful form such as hydrogen for load levelling and peak load shaving. Carbon/hydrocarbon assisted water electrolysis for hydrogen generation can significantly reduce the footprint of renewable energy sources and has the potential to enable faster adoption of this technology. Carbon/hydrocarbon assisted water electrolysis in a PEM electrolysis system offers a significant advantage in terms of reduced electric energy input, pure H2 and CO2 production in separate compartments equivalent to coal gasification, shift reaction and hydrogen/CO2 separation in a single low temperature reactor [6]. However the kinetics of the carbon oxidation is very sluggish, and thus the current densities achieved are still very low [6,7]. A number of studies have focused on exploring innovative approaches of utilizing alcohols (methanol [8–12], ethanol [13–16]), formic acid [17,18], glycerol [19], ethylene glycol [20], and carbon/coal slurry [6,7] in co-electrolysis of water (often referred to as carbon/hydrocarbon assisted water electrolysis (CAWE)). Amongst various hydrocarbons investigated, methanol is an attractive source of hydrogen containing 12.6wt% H2. It is liquid at ambient temperatures and can be easily synthesized from coal or natural gas and transported in large quantities from one location to the other [21]. Methanol has been used as a fuel in direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) systems because of its high energy density and easy storage/transportation. Methanol obtained from renewable sources, in particular, when produced from biomass sources is an excellent candidate to be considered for hydrocarbon assisted electrolysis in a green hydrogen economy. Further, being a liquid fuel, having high energy density, the process can be used for distributed hydrogen generation on-site and on-demand to reduce the solar PV/wind energy footprint considering that the infrastructure and regulations for methanol logistics are already there. From a commercial perspective, the conceptual system of hydrogen refueling station with CAWE is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1 . The mechanism for the methanol assisted water electrolysis (MAWE) reaction in acidic aqueous media is a complete six-electron transfer pathway and can be expressed as follows: (1) Anode: CH3OH+H2O→CO2 +6H+ +6e− (2) Cathode: 6H+ +6e− →3H2 (3) Overall: CH3OH+H2O→CO2 +3H2 E0 the ≈0.22V/E0 rev ≈0.02V The reversible voltage (E0 rev = −ΔG/nF) of the electrolysis cell is the minimum voltage required to provide the electrical input for the water electrolysis reaction, however, this is only possible if the thermal part of the energy (TΔS) is supplied from the surrounding environment. In order for the electrolysis to occur, the thermal part of energy for the reaction has to be supplied and hence higher cell voltage than reversible value is required. This minimum cell voltage is called thermo-neutral voltage (E 0 the =−ΔH/nF) for hydrogen generation [1,6]. In addition, MAWE can offer an effective and sustainable approach to reduce the electrolysis overpotential to <0.8V (actual minimum onset potential of E0 the for methanol=0.22V based on thermo-neutral voltage) compared to conventional water electrolysis for which E00 the for water=1.48V. Table 1 gives the electrochemical reactions (anodic and cathodic), number of electrons involved, and reversible and thermo-neutral voltages for a conventional and other fuel assisted electrolysis systems. In terms of methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), the Pt catalyst is easily deactivated due to poisoning from carbon monoxide-like intermediates (COads, COHads, and HCOHads) [22–24]. Binary PtRu catalyst has been shown to provide good activity for MOR due to the bifunctional mechanism where Ru actively adsorbs OHads species at lower potential than Pt and then enhances the oxidation of surface poisoning intermediates [22–24]. Therefore, most of the MAWE studies have been performed by employing PtRu as the anode catalyst with loading in the range of 1–4mgcm−2 in PEM as well as alkaline electrolysis systems using methanol concentration in the range 1–10M at cell temperatures varying from room temperature to 120°C [9–11]. Sethu et al. investigated Pt [11] and Pt-Pd [25] catalyzed membrane using a non-equilibrium impregnation reduction method. Using Pt catalyzed MEA, a stack (5-cells) voltage of 3.95V (average cell voltage 0.79V) produced a current density of 1Acm−2 at 80°C with 4M methanol solution, compared to a maximum current density of 1.9Acm−2 at 1V with bimetallic Pt-Pd (70:30) catalyst. Guenot et al. [26] and Lamy et al. [27] investigated the reaction kinetics of MOR using PtRu/C catalyst (4mgcm−2). They reported that the electrical energy consumption for MAWE can decrease to below 1.2 kWh m−3 of hydrogen produced. Osa et al. [28] employed a synthesized bimetallic Pt7-Sn3/C catalyst (1.5mgcm−2) for studies on PEM based alcohol (methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol) assisted electrolysis at temperatures in the range 60–90°C. It was reported that the methanol in blended water solution showed the highest performance among the alcohols due to easier oxidation of simple single carbon molecule (C1). Despite these improvements, the sluggish kinetics of MOR and poor long-term stability of electrochemical cells utilizing methanol (DMFC and MAWE) are still a major concern. In this work, the MAWE for hydrogen production has been investigated using various Pt-based catalysts employing a PEM based zero-gap electrolysis cell. The electrodes with nano-sized metal oxide (SnO2 and CeO2) have been prepared by using a well-controlled spraying method to maintain high activity of the catalyst surface and to suppress the destruction of the catalyst alloy structure [13,29]. The purpose of this study was to thoroughly investigate various combination of metal oxide and Pt-based catalysts to enhance the performance with time as well as lower the noble metal catalyst loading."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals and materials,"2.1 Chemicals and materials All reagents used in this work were of analytical grade. In order to investigate the effect of catalyst combinations for MOR, six different types of catalyst combinations (Pt/C, PtRu/C, PtSn/C and Pt/C mixed with nano SnO2 and nano CeO2 and PtRu/C mixed with nano SnO2) were tested as anode catalysts using high purity 40wt% Pt/C (E-TEK), a bimetallic alloy of 40wt% PtRu/C (Pt:Ru=1:1 by atomic ratio, E-TEK) and 20wt% PtSn/C (Pt:Sn=3:1 by atomic ratio, Premetek), cerium (IV) oxide (nano-powder <25nm particle size BET, Sigma-Aldrich), and Tin (IV) oxide (nano-powder <100nm particle size BET, Sigma-Aldrich). Note that the total catalyst loading for all anode catalysts was kept at 2mgcm−2. Where SnO2 or CeO2 were added, their loading was fixed at 0.5mgcm−2, with total noble metal catalyst (Pt or Pt+Ru) loading of 1.5mgcm−2. Nafion membrane 115 was used as an electrolyte and Nafion solution (5wt%, 1100EW, Ion Power, Inc., USA) was used as an ionomer for preparing electrodes. All solutions and inks were prepared with pure deionized water (ρ=18MΩcm) from a water purification system via a Millipore filter (0.22μm pore size). Methanol (CH3OH), 2-propanol, H2O2 and H2SO4 were obtained from Merck, Germany. A hydrophilic plain carbon paper (SGL 25AA, Germany, no wet proof, thickness: 190μm) was used as the anode gas diffusion layer (GDL) to improve the diffusion of methanol to the catalyst reaction interface, while a hydrophobic GDL (Toray TGP-H-120, Japan, 30wt% wet proof, thickness: 370μm) was used as a cathode to facilitate the H2 gas release and to control methanol crossover."
3,Membrane electrode assembly preparation and cell setup,"2.2 Membrane electrode assembly preparation and cell setup In order to achieve an effective electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol and H2 production, a PEM zero-gap electrolysis cell was prepared and more detailed description of the fabrication procedure are reported in a previous publication [13]. In brief, the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) was assembled by hot pressing the electrodes on both sides of the Nafion 115 membrane at 140°C under applied pressure of 5MPa for 5min. For the conventional PEM water electrolysis cells, the oxygen electrode was prepared by IrPt/Ti mesh (IrPt loading=0.4mgcm−2), and hydrogen electrode was prepared by following the same procedure. The electrolysis cell was assembled by employing two titanium plates, each of 5mm thick with parallel flow channels on the electrode side of the plate. The schematic of the alcohol assisted water electrolysis setup is shown in Fig. 2 . Methanol solution was circulated in the anode chamber of the cell with the help of a peristaltic pump (Masterflex L/S Easy-Load II, Cole-Parmer) at a flow rate of 20mLmin−1. Hydrogen produced in the cathode chamber was passed through a cold trap to separate water from hydrogen. The hydrogen flow rate was measured using an in-house made Bunte burette and cross-checked with a digital volumetric flow meter (Defender 510, BIOS International Corp., USA). All experiments were carried out under an ambient pressure and the cell temperatures were varied from 30°C to 60°C. The voltage-current characteristics were obtained by using a DC power supply (Powerbox PBX, Australia) and a digital multimeter (Keithley 192 DMM). The performance stability of the cell was evaluated by using a VersaSTAT 4 (Princeton Applied research, USA). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS; IM6e, Zahner, Germany) was performed under potentiostatic mode at 0.8V at excitation amplitude of 20mV. The frequency range chosen for the EIS was from 10kHz to 100 mHz with 10 steps per decade. Zview™ impedance modelling software was used to better elucidate methanol oxidation mechanism and study the effect of different anode catalysts on MAWE."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Effect of cell temperature and methanol concentration,"3.1 Effect of cell temperature and methanol concentration In order to investigate the effect of different cell operating conditions on MAWE, the voltage-current characteristics for a PEM zero-gap electrolysis cell with Pt/C catalyst were measured using 0.5–2M methanol at different temperatures. The operating temperature of methanol assisted water electrolysis cell should be below the methanol boiling point of 65°C in order to minimize the methanol vaporization and at the same time have reasonable electro-catalytic activity. Although MAWE cells operating at high temperatures would enhance the electro-catalytic activity and decrease MEA ohmic resistance, it would also increase the loss of methanol in blended water solution from reservoir unless the system is operated at a much higher pressure. Therefore in the present study, the cell was operated by maintaining the cell and reservoir temperatures at 30°C and a maximum temperature of 60°C (well below the methanol boiling point of 65°C) to minimize the effect of methanol vapour loss on the cell performance. The results are shown in Fig. 3 . As expected, the polarization curves of electrolysis exhibit higher current densities with increasing temperature (Fig. 3(a)). This improvement in performance can be clearly attributed to enhancing MOR kinetics and mass-transport of methanol to the anode reaction interface, as well as facilitation of the hydrogen production reaction at the cathode. The cell voltage–current (V–I) density data showed a linear trend at lower current densities, however, a limiting behaviour is evident at higher current densities. Furthermore, the limiting current behaviour was seen to be reducing with increasing operating temperature. The current density obtained for the cell at 60°C was 225mAcm−2 at 0.8V. Fig. 3(b) shows the effect of methanol concentration on the V–I characteristics obtained at 60°C. It is clearly observed that the influence of the methanol concentration is negligible at low current densities (<150mAcm−2), however, a significantly enhanced performance was observed at high current densities with the increase in the methanol concentration due to the improved mass-transfer near the anode/electrolyte interface. The limiting current behavior is quite prominent for 0.5M and it is totally absent at 2M concentration. This is also evident from the impedance spectra taken for 1M and 2M methanol concentrations at 0.8V where another arc appeared on the low frequency (LF) side for 1M solution whereas this arc was almost undetectable for 2M solution (Fig. 3(c)). This arc was attributed to a Warburg-type diffusion restricted behavior (see below). Generally, the performance of methanol oxidation system can be more sensitive to change in the methanol concentration depending on its methanol flow system in a continuous fresh solution supply or a circulating solution with methanol reservoir system. This behavior is in good agreement with previous static cell MAWE and passive DMFC systems [9,30,31]. Unlike the DMFC system, the methanol crossover (permeating from the anode to the cathode) will have less effect on mixed potential and catalyst poisoning at the cathode because of the absence of any oxidants (air and O2) in the MAWE system [10]."
6,Effect of anode catalyst,"3.2 Effect of anode catalyst 3.2.1 Voltage-current characteristics The cells with different anode catalysts were operated using 2M methanol solution at 60°C. As a reference, an electrolysis cell with IrPt catalyst coated Ti mesh as the anode was operated with water in the conventional electrolysis mode. Fig. 4 shows the V–I characteristics of the MAWE with different anode catalysts as well as for the conventional electrolysis. The onset of methanol assisted electrolysis occurs at cell voltages below 0.4V compared to above 1.4V for conventional electrolysis. However, it is worth noting that the V–I slope is shallower for conventional electrolysis compared to MAWE, varying significantly with the type of anode catalyst. These results clearly indicate faster kinetics and lower overpotential losses for the water electrolysis compared with methanol oxidation. The current densities at the beginning of the V–I curves although are different for different catalysts, but once the V–I curves are extrapolated to zero current density, the Y-intercept of all curves is tending to approach the thermo-neutral voltage of 0.22V for the MAWE. Amongst all anode catalysts evaluated, the PtRu/C catalyst showed excellent electrolysis activity with about two-fold enhancement in current density (440mAcm−2 at 0.8V) compared with the Pt/C catalyst under identical cell operating conditions as seen in Fig. 4. This improved performance by the bimetallic PtRu/C catalyst is attributed to the bifunctional reaction mechanism, as discussed in the introduction section, leading to faster oxidation of adsorbed intermediates, including CO on the PtRu catalyst in the reaction and thus its significantly higher CO-poisoning tolerance than the unmodified Pt catalyst [22–24]. Despite this remarkable performance with PtRu/C catalyst, the cost and log-term durability of the process are still of some concern. One option to lower the noble metal catalyst loading is to explore non noble metal catalysts that can fully or partly replace the noble metal catalysts. In this regard, SnO2 and CeO2 have been investigated in the present study as part replacement of the Pt and Ru anode catalysts. From the V–I characteristics of cells with these anode catalysts (Fig. 4), the performance of all anode catalysts for MAWE varied from better to worse as: PtRu/C>Pt/C-SnO2 >PtRu/C-SnO2 >Pt/C>PtSn/C>Pt/C-CeO2. Using low noble metal catalyst loading, both Pt/C-SnO2 and PtRu/C-SnO2 exhibited reasonable performance with current densities of 278mAcm−2 and 261mAcm−2 respectively at 0.8V. Note that below 0.8V, the performance of PtRu/C-SnO2 catalyst is slightly better than Pt/C-SnO2, however, the trend reversed above 0.8V. These results seems to indicate that the presence of Ru (in PtRu/C-SnO2) is beneficial at lower voltages to take care of CO poisoning, however, higher amounts of Pt (in Pt/C-SnO2) helps in the kinetics of electrolysis process as shown by higher current densities at higher voltages. It is worth noting that the performance of the Pt/C-SnO2 (278mAcm−2 at 0.8V) is significantly better than that of Pt/C (222mAcm−2 at 0.8V) catalyst, despite the lower Pt loading in the former (0.5mgcm−2 lower), clearly showing the enhancement in the performance by SnO2. The performance of the PtSn/C and Pt/C-CeO2 has been found to be the poorest among the anode catalysts studied, and both Sn and CeO2 appear to show no catalytic effect on the MAWE process. 3.2.2 Normalized current densities and Faradaic efficiency The current densities achieved for each catalyst at 0.8V were normalized by the total weight of the noble metals (Pt and Ru) in all catalyst compositions studied. The Faradaic efficiency (%) values were calculated based on the average flow rates of hydrogen generated corresponding to the 2A current passed through the cells. The normalized values of current densities (mAcm−2 per mg cm−2 noble metal catalyst on primary Y-axis) are plotted as a column chart along with the Faradaic efficiency (secondary Y-axis) for each catalyst in Fig. 5 . The Faradaic efficiency for all catalysts evaluated varied from 96-98%, well within the experimental errors of flow rate measurements, thus indicating that majority of the current is contributing towards the hydrogen generation, and there is almost complete oxidation of methanol occurring under the process conditions. The figure shows that the normalized current density is highest (220mAmg−1) for PtRu/C as expected from the V–I characteristics in Fig. 4. The performance for the catalyst with SnO2 added is somewhat lower at 185mAmg−1 and 174mAmg−1 respectively for the Pt/C-SnO2 and PtRu/C-SnO2. The order of anode catalyst activity for MAWE performance at 0.8V based on the results in Fig. 5 follows: PtRu/C>Pt/C-SnO2 >PtRu/C-SnO2 >Pt/C>PtSn/C>Pt/C-CeO2. This trend is similar to the one deducted from Fig. 4. Note that the performance in terms of normalized current density is also better for Pt/C-SnO2 than that for PtRu-SnO2 or Pt/C. A potential role of SnO2 in significantly enhancing electrolysis performance is most likely attributed to the synergic effect of Pt and PtRu with nano-sized SnO2. The added SnO2 would enhance the CO oxidation on the Pt based catalyst surface with readily providing OHads species leading to more favorable electrocatalytic activity on the Pt toward methanol oxidation via the bifunctional mechanism whereas in the case of PtRu this role is already filled by Ru and SnO2 may only serve to dilute electroactive sites in PtRu-SnO2. Moreover, the observation of the role of SnO2 in Pt based catalysts is in excellent agreement with the reported data [22,32]. Another interesting observation from the polarization curves (Fig. 4) and normalized current densities (Fig. 5) is that the PtSn catalyst for the MOR exhibited a significantly poor performance among the catalysts evaluated for methanol electrolysis. This is in contrast to the observations made by other investigators on ethanol oxidation for fuel cell and electrolysis cell systems, where PtSn has shown improved oxidation kinetics [16,33,34]. In our previous studies on ethanol assisted water electrolysis, it was reported that the binary PtSn electro-catalyst not only enhanced the C-H bond dissociation for C2 chemicals but it also facilitated further oxidation of intermediates [13]. However, the enhancing effect of PtSn for the MOR can strongly depend on the preparation method of electro-catalyst which can affect the chemical state of Sn as reported by Jiang et al. [35]. 3.2.3 Catalyst and cell or performance stability In order to establish the stability of the catalysts in operation, cells with four better catalysts (Pt/C, PtRu/C, Pt/C-SnO2 and PtRu/C-SnO2) were tested continuously for extended periods of time (4h) in chronopotentiometric mode at 150mAcm−2 with cells operating at 60°C. The cells were operated with 2M concentration of methanol using a 400ml solution circulated at a flow rate of 20mlmin−1. During the 4h of test period no methanol solution top up was made. Fig. 6 compares the variation in cell voltage for the cells with different anode catalysts as a function of time. The overall cell voltages observed at 150mAcm−2 were in the order PtRu/C<PtRu/C-SnO2 <Pt/C-SnO2 <Pt/C. Note that PtRu/C-SnO2 performance is better than Pt/C-SnO2 for long-term test, consistent with the V–I characteristics in Fig. 4 at 150mAcm−2 current density. At higher current densities the trend for PtRu/C-SnO2 <Pt/C-SnO2 as per Figs. 4 and 5 is reversed. On further analysis, the cell voltage rate of increase for PtRu/C, PtRu/C-SnO2, Pt/C and Pt/C-SnO2 was found to be respectively 13.5, 16.5, 8.1 and 7.0mVhr−1. This is very interesting observation in terms of stability of the cell voltage with time. Even though the cell voltages in the presence of Ru in the catalyst are lower over the 4h period of testing at 150mAcm−2 current density, the cell voltages are more stable for both Pt/C and Pt/C-SnO2 catalysts and the addition of SnO2 to the Pt/C catalyst results in not only lower cell voltage but also better stability. As discussed above, the intrinsic drawback of Pt-based electrocatalyst is the sluggish kinetics and poisoning due to CO-like species. The secondary element (Ru) with Pt catalyst can enhance electro-oxidation of COads or intermediate molecules on the Pt surface [23,24,36]. Thus, we propose that a similar mechanism prevails for SnO2 and can rewrite the anode Reaction (1) in terms of the MOR with the oxidation of CO-like intermediates taking place via the bifunctional mechanism as shown below (* represents a free catalyst sites): (4) (Pt-Ru or Pt-SnO2)*–CH3OH→Pt–COads +4H+ +4e− (Pt-Ru or Pt-SnO2)*–CH3OH→Pt–COHads +3H+ +3e− (4′) (5) H2O+(Ru and/or SnO2)*→OHads +H+ +e− (6) Pt–COads +OHads −(Ru and/or SnO2)→Pt*+(Ru and/or SnO2)*+CO2 +H+ +e− Pt–COHads +OHads–(Ru and/or SnO2)→Pt*+(Ru and/or SnO2)*+CO2 +2H+ +2e− (6′) The MOR path (Reaction (1)) to CO2 seems to be very much limited by the sluggish electrochemical catalytic activity on the catalyst surface due to adsorption of CO-like poisoning species at the anode (Reactions (4) and (4′)) and most likely is a rate-limiting step. We hypothesize that the mechanism of MOR in the MAWE using Pt-based catalyst may be an indirect electrocatalytic oxidation involving the adsorption of OH species on Ru or SnO2 (Reaction (5)) via bifunctional mechanism and overall reaction is a 6-electrons transfer oxidation through reaction steps of (4)–(6) or (4′)–(6′). In contrast, the MOR can also lead to incomplete oxidation to form either formic acid (HCOOH) or formaldehyde (HCOH) according to the cell conditions such as insufficient catalyst active sites, operating temperature, applied cell potential, and high methanol concentration [9,37]. However, the incomplete oxidation of methanol in MAWE can be avoided by feeding larger quantities of water than required as per the water to methanol stoichiometric ratio for the MOR. 3.2.4 Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) Fig. 7 shows the EIS of the MAWE cells at OCV for Pt/C anode catalyst at the beginning of the cell operation and under potentiostatic mode (0.8V) at the beginning and end of 4h of operation. The Ohmic part (Rohm), where high frequency side of spectra intersects the real axis is mainly attributable to the Nafion membrane resistance of the cell. This component had decreased under load from 0.29Ω-cm2 at OCV to ∼0.2Ω-cm2 at 0.8V, and it did not change over 4h operation of the cell. It seems that under load the proton transport through the membrane is enhanced by the increase in water species being carried over across the membrane thus leading to decrease in the Nafion membrane resistance. Each impedance spectra appears to be made up of three arcs. There is a smaller arc on high frequency (HF) side of the spectra that seems to be not changing in size on loading the cell, with time under load and for different anode catalysts and thus is most probably due to the hydrogen evolution reaction (Rct, cathode: ∼0.3Ω-cm2) as also reported in a previous publication [13]. The large arc on LF side of spectra under OCV appears to be related to Warburg-type diffusion process which under load changes to a very small closed arc and it increases slightly in size with operating time which may be due to a decrease in the methanol concentration with time. The evidence for this is provided in Fig. 3(c) where the size of this low frequency arc under load (0.8V) increased when the methanol concentration was reduced from 2M to 1M. The middle arc which increases in size with time and under load can be clearly attributed to the anodic reaction of methanol oxidation. The increase in the resistance for this component can be mostly attributed to the increased poisoning of the catalyst surface by CO-like intermediates during the MAWE process. This poisoning behavior can block catalyst sites from the further adsorption of fresh methanol solution. A similar behavior has been observed by other investigators in DMFCs and ethanol assisted water electrolysis (EAWE) cells [24,38]. The electrochemical oxidation of adsorbed CO-like intermediates is considered to be the rate-limiting step in these cells as discussed in the previous section. Interestingly, the impedance plots exhibit distorted tails at LF arc (<100 mHz) under load. It is generally accepted that the effect of CO poisoning of the anode catalyst during the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol can be revealed by a clockwise pseudo-inductive loop at the LF due to competitive behaviors of blocking the active surface and further oxidation of adsorbed CO-like reaction intermediate [24,38]. In order to further elucidate the Warburg-type impedance at low frequency region, the impedance data was modelled as per the equivalent circuit shown as inset in Fig. 7. This data fitted reasonably well with proposed equivalent circuit including Warburg-type element within 10% error for all circuit elements as shown by the fitted curve for impedance data obtained at the beginning and after 4h operation in Fig. 7. The values of the model parameters determined are summarized in Table 2 . This Warburg-like behavior can be attributed to a quasi-steady state of the MAWE system under alternative electrochemical oxidation environments such as varying current density in the potentiostatic mode at each frequency and time-dependent transients of current density [38,39]. Thus, the observed Warburg-like diffusion tail is most likely associated with the physicochemically blocking of the anode surface by the adsorbed CO-like intermediates. Fig. 8 shows the electrochemical impedance spectra of the MAWE cells for the anode catalysts Pt/C, Pt/C-SnO2, PtRu/C and PtRu/C-SnO2 obtained under potentiostatic mode (0.8V) at the end of 4h of operation. The Ohmic resistance for all cells was in the range 0.17 to 0.21Ω-cm2. As expected, the Rct,anode with PtRu/C anode is the lowest, and is ∼3/4th compared to that in the case of Pt/C. This is as discussed earlier due to enhanced MOR activity by the presence of Ru in the catalyst and improvement in CO tolerance due to the bifunctional mechanism. The figure also shows that Rct, anode for Pt/C-SnO2 is although somewhat larger than PtRu/C, is ∼10% smaller than for Pt/C and ∼23% smaller than PtRu/C-SnO2 catalyst. These results again clearly demonstrate the superior performance of the Pt/C-SnO2 catalyst over Pt/C as well as PtRu/C-SnO2 catalyst in line with the observations made with respect to the normalized current densities achieved and stability of the operation over time. Thus, these EIS results are in good agreement with our hypothesis discussed previously on the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol in the MAWE."
7,Power consumption analysis of MAWE system,"3.3 Power consumption analysis of MAWE system The power consumption in an electrolysis cell is directly proportional to the cell voltage according to Faraday’s law as given below. (7) Power consumption ( kWh m − 3 ) = V cell × nF 3600 × 1 24.47 = 2.19 × V c e l l . Vcell, n, F in the above equation are the cell voltage at a particular current density (hydrogen production rate), number of electrons participating in the reaction and Faraday constant (96,485 coulombs/mole). The molar volume of hydrogen used at 25°C, 1atm pressure is 24.47L. In order to compare the minimum power input required for the electrolysis process to occur, the above equation was used to determine power consumption with Vcell as the thermo-neutral voltage. Table 1 compares these values for different fuel assisted electrolysis processes with conventional electrolysis. The table shows that methanol assisted electrolysis requires the lowest power (0.48kWhm−3) for hydrogen generation process to start. The actual power consumption values are expected to be significantly higher due to the process kinetics and the various overvoltage losses in the cell resulting from electrochemical processes at practical current densities (hydrogen production rates). For example, the conventional water electrolysis cells require around 4.2kWhm−3 at applied cell voltage of 1.8–2V. However, based on the present study, the methanol assisted electrolysis cells can be operated at 0.8V with reasonable current densities (∼300mAcm−2 for Pt/C-SnO2 catalyst as seen in Fig. 4), thus requiring only 1.75kWhm−3 power input. This represents about 60% savings on the electric power input compared to conventional electrolysis."
8,Conclusion,"Methanol assisted water electrolysis for hydrogen generation has been studied. The performance of MAWE electrochemical cells was investigated under different process conditions and by employing different Pt-based anode (methanol oxidation) catalysts (Pt/C, Pt/C-SnO2, Pt/C-CeO2, PtRu/C, PtRu/C-SnO2, and PtSn/C) through an optimized spraying method in the PEM based zero-gap electrolysis cell. The Faradaic efficiency determined by measuring volumetric hydrogen flow rates corresponding to fixed value of current (achieved below 0.8V) for all cells is mostly close to 100%, thus demonstrating almost complete oxidation of methanol. The normalised current densities with respect to noble metal catalyst loading (mAmg−1) achieved at 0.8V were in the order PtRu/C>Pt/C-SnO2 >PtRu/C-SnO2 >Pt/C>PtSn/C>Pt/C-CeO2. The voltage stability tests performed with different anode catalysts over 4h duration revealed that Pt/C-SnO2 catalyst produces lowest rate of cell voltage increase with time, thus demonstrating that the addition of SnO2 in the Pt/C catalyst enhances the stability of the cell. This was further confirmed by the impedance spectra obtained for different catalysts, and Pt/C-SnO2 showing smaller anodic polarisation compared to Pt/C and PtRu/C-SnO2 catalysts. The study further shows that the methanol assisted electrolysis cells can be operated at reasonable current densities (∼300mAcm−2) with Pt/C-SnO2 catalyst requiring only 1.75kWhm−3 power input for hydrogen generation, and this represents about 60% savings on the electric power input compared to conventional electrolysis."
