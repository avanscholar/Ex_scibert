0,Introduction,"The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has reached an unprecedented level that is widely considered as a major anthropogenic source for global warming. According to BP statistical review of world energy, in the year 2016, global emissions of CO2 from energy consumption has reached about 33.4 billion tons, though average emissions growth during 2014–2016 has been the lowest over any three-year period since 1981–1983 (Fig. 1 ) [1]. CO2 is also an abundant C1 feedstock for making chemicals, materials, fuels, and carbohydrates. In addition, CO2 utilization is considered with much attention as it would recycle carbon and reduce the emission of CO2. Catalytic synthesis of methanol directly from CO2 and hydrogen (H2) holds as a central technology for CO2 utilization. Methanol can be considered as a starting feedstock in chemical industries and as an alternative to fossil fuels [2–4]. Recently, the MTH (methanol to hydrocarbons) process [5], including methanol to olefins (MTO), methanol to propene (MTP), Mobil’s olefin-to-gasoline and distillate process (MOGD) and Topsøe’s improved gasoline synthesis (TIGAS) processes, represents a key step in the conversion of any carbonaceous feedstock, via methanol, to a range of hydrocarbons and water, and is currently gaining industrial significance. The needed H2 for CO2 conversion to methanol is currently produced from fossil fuels by steam reforming or partial oxidation of methane and coal gasification, which can be also generated from splitting of water (electrochemical, thermal, photolytic, and so on). The green production of H2 which assisted by nuclear or renewable energy (solar, wind, biomass and so on) is one of the essential component to realize the fundamental reduction of carbon emission [6]. In addition, when H2 originates directly from renewable energy sources, CO2 hydrogenation to methanol can provide an important approach for dealing with the intermittence of renewable sources by storing energy in methanol. In Iceland, the pioneering demonstration CO2 to methanol plant using locally available cheap geothermal energy has been built by the company Carbon Recycling International. In Canada, Blue Fuel Energy will build a CO2 to methanol plant with capacity 400,000 t y–1, powered by renewable electricity [7]. Therefore, CO2 hydrogenation to methanol is considered as one of the economic ways to alleviate the global warming and to drive chemical and energy companies towards a more sustainable use of resources. The methanol synthesis from CO2 and H2 constitutes two main reactions: the synthesis of methanol, (1) C O 2 +3 H 2 ⇌ C H 3 OH+ H 2 O Δ r H 298K = 41 .2kJ mo l – 1 and the reverse water gas shift (RWGS), (2) C O 2 + H 2 ⇌ CO+ H 2 O Δ r H 298K = 41 .2kJ mo l – 1 The methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation and RWGS are thermodynamically limited reactions, and the equilibrium conversion of CO2 decreases with increasing reaction temperature [8,9]. In addition, the synthesis of methanol is an exothermic reaction, but it competes with RWGS, which is an endothermic reaction. Thus, despite that an increase in temperature facilitates CO2 activation, high temperature can result in higher selectivity to undesirable CO and H2O, and reduce CO2 equilibrium conversion rate. It is worth noting that the presence of water that comes from both the reactions accelerates the sintering of active sites in the catalysts, leading to the deactivation of catalyst and subsequently reducing the consecutive step in the production of methanol [10,11]. Therefore, designing an efficient catalytic system, which is conducive to promote CO2 molecules activation and simultaneously prevent the by-products formation, as well as operating in an efficient way at temperatures below 180 °C, are important indicators of high efficiency methanol catalyst [12,13]. Several excellent reviews were published recently that cover CO2 conversion and catalytic CO2 hydrogenation [14–24]. Advances have been made in the past decade, especially on CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. A bibliometric analysis was performed using the SCI-Expanded search platform to examine the publication activity for catalytic CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, and the search results are shown in Fig. 2 . It can be found that the number of works on the topic of catalytic CO2 hydrogenation to methanol has increased by more than 3-fold in the last ten years. Among these publications, a wide variety of heterogeneous catalysts have been evaluated in the direct conversion of CO2 and H2 into methanol. Therefore, this brief overview on the recent developments in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol tries to provide a current understanding of catalyst design, catalytic performance and reaction mechanism over various types of heterogeneous catalysts with an emphasis on practical aspects. Generally, heterogeneous methanol catalysts can be mainly classified into three categories: (1) Metal-based catalysts, which are mainly modified methanol catalysts for CO hydrogenation with Cu species as the main active component and catalysts with noble metals such as Au, Ag, Pd and Pt as active components; (2) Oxygen deficient materials, their oxygen vacancy sites are used as active sites; (3) Other catalytic system with novel catalytic structure. The reaction mechanism of this kind of catalyst is very different from those of two kinds of catalytic systems mentioned above."
1,Metal-based catalysts families,
2,Copper based catalysts,"2.1 Copper based catalysts In the past few decades, extensive experimental and theoretical investigations of CO2 hydrogenation have been carried out [25–27]. Although many kinds of metal-based catalysts have been examined for the synthesis of methanol, modified copper based methanol catalysts remain the main catalytic system. 2.1.1 Reaction mechanism It is generally accepted that metallic Cu is the active phase for methanol synthesis via CO2 hydrogenation, the mechanism of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol over Cu-based catalysts was proposed by many researchers through using experiment and DFT calculation. Two major reaction pathways have been proposed for CO2 hydrogenation over Cu as illustrated in Fig. 3 . The first pathway is associated with the formate (*HCOO) intermediate formed by CO2 reacting with surface atomic H via either an Eley-Rideal (ER) or Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) mechanism [29]. *HCOO is then hydrogenated to dioxymethylene (*HCOOH), followed by further hydrogenation to *H2COOH, cleaved to formaldehyde (*H2CO) and hydroxyl (*OH). The adsorbed *H2CO is further hydrogenated to methoxy (*H3CO) or methylenoxy (*H2COH), and the final product methanol (*H3COH) (designated as the formate pathway). Larmier et al. [30] studied the reaction mechanisms on Cu/ZrO2 using kinetics, in situ IR and NMR spectroscopies, and isotopic labeling strategies. Combined with DFT calculations, it was suggested that methanol was a primary product formed by the hydrogenation of formate as a reaction intermediate in Fig. 4 . Very recently, Kattel et al. [31] also proposed that the formate was an intermediate species for methanol on the Cu/ZnO catalyst. With the aid of infrared spectroscopy (IR) and mass spectroscopy (MS) measurements, Yang et al. [32] studied the reactivity of surface-adsorbed species present on copper catalysts during “titration” (transient surface reaction) experiments with isotopic tracing (Fig. 5 ). The results show that adsorbed formate is major bystander specie present on the surface under steady-state methanol synthesis reaction conditions, but it cannot be converted to methanol by reaction with pure H2 especially in a moist reaction environment. Therefore, the widely recognized formate pathway is shown as a dead end, while the methanol synthesis occurs on carboxyl intermediate. A significant amount of *HCOO species can be observed on both Cu/TiO2 and Cu/ZrO2 catalysts during the reaction, while the reduction of CO2 to CH3OH via the formate pathway seemed not efficient due to the poisoning of *HCOO species. By comparison, the RWGS + CO-Hydro pathway via the *H3CO intermediate was more likely. This pathway is featured by the CO intermediate, which is produced from the RWGS reaction via carboxyl (HOCO) species, and is further hydrogenated to the final product CH3OH (designated as the CO-Hydro pathway) [33]. Gao and Au [34] studied methanol synthesis from CO2 and H2 over YBa2Cu3O7 catalysts. They proposed a rare pathway that the adsorbed CO2 reacts via stepwise hydrogenation to hydrocarboxyl (COOH), dihydrocarbene (COHOH), formic acid (HCOOH), and dihydromethyl (HCOHOH). The possible intermediates COOH, COHOH, HCOHOH, and dihydromethane (H2COHOH) then transform to formate (HCOO), (H2COO), formyl (HCO), and formaldehyde (H2CO) groups, respectively. The crucial steps for methanol formation in this hydrocarboxyl-like mechanism might be the hydrogenation of HCO and H2CO, and designated as hydrocarboxyl (COOH) pathway. Fujita et al. [35], Wu et al. [36] and Arena et al. [37] proposed that the presence of water during methanol synthesis accelerated the crystallization growth of metal oxide and led to the deactivation of the catalysts and non-adsorption of CO2. In addition, the more extensive wetting of the catalyst surface enhanced the chemical affinity of alumina carrier for water, decreased the active sites for CO2 adsorption and hydrogenation and reduced the rate of methanol formation. However, Zhao et al. [28] used DFT calculation to investigate the role of H2O in methanol synthesis. The results show that the presence of H2O markedly promotes trans-COOH formation via a hydrogen transfer process in the hydrocarboxyl mechanism. In this hydrogen transfer mechanism, weakly bonded CO2 is hydrogenated by one of the H atoms in H2O as surface H and begins to strongly interact with the H2O molecule to form trans-COOH. In view of the fact that trans-COOH is an important intermediate for the formation of COOH and the formation of the trans-COOH is the bottleneck step in the hydrocarboxyl mechanism. Therefore, H2O is beneficial to the process of methanol synthesis by CO2 hydrogenation based on hydrocarboxyl mechanism. The water-mediated pathway was named as H2O promoted hydrocarboxyl (COOH) pathway. On the other hand, they also found that the existing presence of H2O on the copper based catalysts surface actually played an inhibiting role in the further hydrogenation or decomposition processes from HCOO to methanol in the formate mechanism via converting effective intermediate mono-HCOO to bystander species bi-HCOO. 2.1.2 Oxide supported Cu-based catalysts system In view of the significantly lower selectivity to methanol, catalytic activity and stability, copper alone is not efficient in the synthesis of methanol from CO2 [38,39]. An appropriate support not only affects the formation and stabilization of the active phase of the catalysts but also is capable of tuning the interactions between the major component and promoter. Whether as catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol in industry, or as model catalysts for theoretical research, Cu/ZnO and further modified catalysts are still the focuses of current research [40,41]. The main reason for this lies in that ZnO can improve the dispersion and stabilization of copper, the lattice oxygen vacancies and an electron pair in the ZnO are active for methanol synthesis [42]. Table 1 lists selected catalytic results for various Cu-based catalysts mentioned in the Sections 2.1.2 and 2.1.3 along with experimental conditions. Bianchi et al. [43], Fisher and Bell [44], and Rhodes and Bell [45] originally proposed a dual-site, bifunctional mechanism to explain relatively high activity and selectivity of methanol on Cu/ZnO catalysts. The widely accepted dual-site mechanism which deems that the adsorption and dissociation of hydrogen occur on the Cu site, while the adsorption of CO2 as bicarbonate takes place on the ZnO site. via spillover, the atomic hydrogen then transfers from the surface of Cu onto the surface of ZnO and stepwise hydrogenates the adsorbed carbon containing species to methanol. However, Tisseraud et al. [46] recognized the important role of the CuZnO interface structure and proposed a spherical contact quantification model. Atomic hydrogen derived from hydrogen spillover transferred from the Cu surface to two distinct active sites: the ZnO surface and ZnO x at the Cu/ZnO interface. Theoretical calculations and experimental results show that ZnO surface is more efficient for CO formation via RWGS and ZnO x is the active site for methanol, indicating the important relationship between Cu x Zn (1-x) O y active phase with oxygen vacancies at Cu-ZnO interface and methanol formation. Many researchers have studied the properties of Cu-ZnO interface and Cu x Zn (1-x) O y composite oxides with oxygen vacancies. Nakamura et al. [47] observed a mountain-shaped relationship between oxygen coverage, Zn coverage with TOF for methanol formation. At optimum Zn coverage, the Zn-deposited Cu surface was six times more active than the Zn-free Cu surface for methanol formation, indicating the suitable proportions of Cu+ and ZnO x species on Zn-deposited polycrystalline Cu surface are the active site of methanol. Poels and Brands [48] have found that Cu will migrate and dissolve in the oxide phase of the catalyst precursor in the process of high temperature reduction, thus forming a Cu-O-Zn structure. In addition, partial reduction of ZnO occurs on the surface of Cu, forming Cu-ZnO x with oxygen deficient composite oxide active phase. More recently, the formation and properties of Cu-ZnO x active sites have been discussed in more depth. Kuld et al. [49] combined surface area titration, electron microscopy, activity measurement, DFT calculations and models to show that the activity and selectivity of methanol had a strong interdependency with Zn coverage derived from the Zn atoms migrating in the Cu surface. Actually, the research of Kuld et al. is a quantitative description of the Nakamura’s conclusion [47], which suggests that the suitable surface Zn coverage is favorable for the formation of sufficient Cu-ZnO x active sites. Lunkenbein et al. [50] utilized a thermal stimulus with the electron beam to transform the industrial Cu-ZnO catalysts structure into Cu nanoparticles (NPs) surrounded with metastable “graphitic-like (GL)” ZnO after reductive activation (Fig. 6 ). The GL ZnO is kinetically stable by interacting with the defective and curved Cu surface underneath. Defects could play a role in the stability of the ZnO overlayer and might lead to the presence of some ZnO x species acting as cocatalysts in the methanol synthesis, illustrating the migration of Zn to Cu surface is closely related to the formation of stable Cu-ZnO interface and Cu-ZnO x active sites in the process of reduction and evaluation. Similar conclusions are emerging in latest research of Tisseraud et al. [51], they designed core-shell Cu@ZnO x catalyst that allowed maximizing the Cu-ZnO contacts and favored a large diffusion of Zn into Cu to cover the metallic Cu surface with the oxygen deficient Cu x Zn (1-x) O y active phase for methanol. The experimental and geometrical approaches also prove that the methanol formation rate is a linear function of the Zn that has migrated into Cu. In summary, it is widely accepted that the active site for the methanol synthesis is the Cu-Zn surface alloy and Cu x Zn (1-x) O y active phase formed by atomic diffusion of Zn from ZnO to the metallic Cu surface. The relationship between the Cu-Zn alloy phase and the Cu x Zn (1-x) O y with oxygen vacancy active phase has been explored and discussed. Choi et al. [52] put forward early that the Cu-O-Zn site in Cu-ZnO x is the active site for CO hydrogenation, while the CO2 hydrogenation occurs on Cu-Zn alloy phase. Although this view is inconsistent with the latest research, they think the Zn that dissolves into the Cu particles creates the Cu-Zn surface alloy, and the Zn over the dissolution limit in the Cu particles becomes ZnO by an oxidation reaction in the process of catalysts evaluation and forms the Cu-O-Zn site at the interface with the Cu particles. Koitaya et al. [53] quantitatively studied the growth modes of the Zn-deposited Cu(111) surface with XPS, UPS and DFT. The results show that alloying is initiated at step sites by position exchange of a Zn atom with a step Cu atom. The exchange between Zn atoms and subsurface Cu atoms is restricted. Hence, deposited Zn atoms are predominantly mixed with surface Cu atoms, and the Zn-Cu surface alloy with a two-atomic layer thickness is finally formed. After the saturation of surface alloy at Zn coverage θZn ∼1 ML, Zn overlayer grows in the three dimensional island manner on the surface alloy surface. Therefore, the Zn-deposited on the Cu surface will form the Cu-Zn alloy phase interface structure with Cu, which will lay the foundation for the next step of oxidation and formation of Cu-ZnO x . Kattel et al. [54] used a combination of XPS, TEM, kinetic Monte Carlo simulations and DFT to verify composition and property conversion of ZnCu catalyst under the reaction conditions. The XPS results show that the binding energy of Zn 2p3/2 peaks shifts from Zn to ZnO. The Zn → ZnO transformation is accompanied by an increase in the catalytic activity for methanol production, and the methanol yield of ZnCu(111) with partial oxidation of Zn significantly improves compared to that of ZnO/Cu(111), suggesting the surface transformation from Zn to ZnO. In addition, the formation and accumulation of *O species derived from the direct dissociation of *CO2 to *CO + *O on ZnCu(111) is consistent with the increase of methanol yield and the important intermediate of *HCOO, and the *O species are likely to be stabilized on the surface and lead to the formation of a ZnO layer during the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. In summary, Cu-ZnO x is the active site for methanol formation in Cu/ZnO catalytic system. The alloy phase formed by Zn-deposition on Cu surface is transformed into the final active site by the oxidation under the reaction conditions. For all catalysts, the preparation methods and conditions, as well as the physicochemical properties of catalyst precursor also play major roles in the behavior of the catalysts. The aforementioned reasonable reaction mechanisms and active sites for Cu/ZnO methanol catalysts suggest that the synergistic interaction between ZnO and Cu is also a key descriptor for the catalyst performance and it is an important target of catalysts design to enhance the interaction between Cu and ZnO to obtain sufficient contact between them. Brown et al. [55] present a “one-pot” approach to catalysts synthesis, applying diethyl zinc as both the reductant to produce copper nanoparticles and the precursor to zinc oxide. The catalysts are produced by the reaction between diethyl zinc and bis(carboxylato/phosphinato)copper(II) precursors. The reaction leads to the formation of a precatalyst solution composed of the Et4Zn5(stearate)6 stabilized Cu°. After catalysis, the reagents Et4Zn5(stearate)6 are hydrolyzed to produce zinc oxide nanoparticles, which are fully contacted with Cu° NPs. The preferential formation of ZnO/Cu interfaces endows the Cu/ZnO catalyst with excellent features of highly active. Zhang et al. [56] described a molecular layer deposition (MLD)-assisted route for the preparation of Cu/ZnO catalysts with enhanced and tunable Cu-ZnO interfaces. A multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MCN) supported with Cu precursor was synthesized, then modified multiwalled carbon nanotubes was coated with Zn-polyurea organic-inorganic hybrid films via MLD using diethyl zinc, phenylene diisocyanate and ethanediamine as precursors. The catalysts were obtained after calcination and reduction under mild conditions. Compared with Cu-ZnO/MCN via impregnation or deposition-precipitation methods, the produced catalysts exhibited remarkably enhanced selectivity, efficiency, and stability due to the created Cu-ZnO interface sites (Cu°Zn) and the cooperative effect between Cu°Zn and Cu+. Kondrat et al. [57] used supercritical antisolvent (SAS) precipitation method with CO2 and exploited the high diffusion rates and solvation power of supercritical CO2 to rapidly expand supersaturate solutions to prepare the exceptionally rare and unstable Cu/Zn georgeite. Compared with Cu/Zn malachite, aurichalcite, rosasite and Cu/Zn/Al hydrotalcite-like precursors, the obtained Cu/Zn georgeite is found to be a precursor to highly active methanol-synthesis. In order to reduce the fabrication cost and complexity, Smith et al. [58] utilized co-precipitation method to succeed in preparing Cu/Zn georgeite with acetate salts as metal sources and ammonium carbonate as precipitant. Although co-precipitated Cu/Zn georgeite contains more impurities and a slightly more ordered structure than the SAS precipitation Cu/Zn georgeite, the co-precipitated Cu/Zn georgeite derived catalysts still display superior performance for methanol synthesis. The highly dispersed, ultrasmall and uniform crystallites size and extremely strong interaction between Cu and ZnO nanoparticles endow Cu/Zn georgeite derived catalysts with high activity. Kondrat et al. [59] discussed the effect of Na+ content on the co-precipitated Cu/Zn georgeite derived catalysts. The results show that samples with lower Na+ contents remain as the amorphous Cu/Zn georgeite phase, inhibit the phase transformation from georgeite to sodium zinc carbonate and zincian malachite, reduce CuO/Cu particle size, increase Cu surface area in Cu/Zn georgeite derived catalysts. In addition, samples with lower Na+ contents inhibit the growth and phase separation of Cu and ZnO NPs during catalysts evaluation. Therefore, Na+ species may disrupt the Cu metal-support interaction, which can reduce the Cu-ZnO x active site at the Cu/ZnO interface, leading catalytic performance degradation. In order to further increase the activity and stability of Cu/ZnO catalysts, different modifiers are used as stabilizer and promoter. Toyir et al. [60] found that the promoting effect of Ga2O3 was strongly associated with Ga2O3 particle size. Small Ga2O3 particles favored the formation of an intermediate state of copper between Cu° and Cu2+, probably Cu+. Li et al. [61] proposed that the introduction of Ga3+ into Cu/ZnO catalysts precursor facilitated the deep reduction of ZnO support to Zn° by the establishment of electronic heterojunction of ZnO-MGa2O4 (M = Zn or Cu). The reduced Zn° when in contact with Cu nanoparticle can form CuZn. Therefore, the doping of Ga3+ promotes the formation of CuZn bimetallic active phase at the interface to enhance the activity and selectivity to methanol. Martin et al. [62] discovered that the introduction of small amounts of a noble metal like Au significantly promoted the electronic stabilization of Cu° and stabilized the interface between Cu and ZnO. Al2O3 has often been used as the promoter to increase the stability and the activity. Kühl et al. [63] presented a Cu-based catalyst derived from a phase pure Cu-Zn-Al hydrotalcite-like precursor that was intrinsically more active than a conventionally prepared Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst. With reduction, a nanostructured catalyst evolved with the metallic Cu particles partly embedded in the remaining metal oxide matrix, resulting in close interfacial contact of Cu particles and continuously Cu-depleted oxide, which resulted in a strong interface interaction between Cu and ZnO [41,63,64]. In addition, Gao et al. [8,65] suggested that the introduction of fluorine ions dramatically promoted the basicity of Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 and the adsorption of CO2, and then increased the CH3OH selectivity. The introduction of suitable amount of fluorine into Cu/ZnO-based catalysts derived from hydrotalcite-like precursors favored the production of methanol significantly. Because of the high stability under reducing or oxidizing atmospheres, zirconia has also been considered as an excellent promoter or support for the methanol synthesis catalyst. ZrO2 added on copper based catalysts could increase the surface area and Cu particles dispersion. In addition, the crystal types of Zr influence performance of the catalysts. Samson et al. [66] proposed that the phase of ZrO2 played an important role in the catalytic performance of Cu/ZrO2. The results show that only the oxygen vacancy in t-ZrO2 is conducive to the promotion of copper atoms into the ZrO2 lattice, and the formation of stable Cu+. In addition, the incorporation of Cu+ or Cu2+ ions into the ZrO2 network compensates for the negative charge of vacancies and further contributes to the stabilization of the t-ZrO2. The Cu-ZrO2 interface site containing oxygen vacancy for methanol formation derived from this enhanced Cu/t-ZrO2 interaction will improve the yield and selectivity of methanol. Ro et al. [67] studied the methanol from CO2 hydrogenation over Cu/ZrO2 catalysts via controlled surface reactions (CSRs) and atomic layer deposition methods. It was found that the formation of Cu-ZrO2 interfacial sites increased the turnover frequency by an order of magnitude in the synthesis of methanol. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) measurements proved that the oxidation states of the Cu and Zr species were primarily Cu° and Zr4+, respectively. However, the valence state of partial Cu and Zr at Cu-ZrO2 interface site were Cu+ and Zrδ+ (δ < 4), suggesting partial Cu° atoms diffused and dissolved in ZrO2 lattice to form Cu-ZrO x . Rungtaweevoranit et al. [68] prepared Cu@UiO-66 catalyst, in which UiO-66 was Zr based metal organic frameworks (MOFs). The XPS shows that Zr 3d binding energy shifts toward lower oxidation state in the presence of Cu NC, suggesting that there is a strong interaction between Cu NC and Zr-O in [Zr6O4(OH)4(-CO2)12] secondary building units (SBUs) of the UiO-66. Therefore, the interface between Cu NC and UiO-66 forms Cu-O-Zr active site, and the TOF for methanol formation and the selectivity to methanol of Cu@UiO-66 are much higher than that of Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts prepared from coprecipitation method especially at low temperature. An et al. [69] reported the use of preassembled 2,2′-bipyridine-5,5′-dicarboxylate and Zr6(μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4 sites in UiO-bpy MOFs to anchor ultra small Cu/ZnO x nanoparticles, thus preventing the agglomeration of Cu NPs and phase separation between Cu and ZnO x in MOF-cavity-confined Cu/ZnO x nanoparticles. It is worth noting that not only Cu-ZnO x active sites can be obtained via this method. The partial transformation from Zr(IV) and Zn(II) to Zr(III) and Zn(0) proves the strong interaction among Cu/ZnO x and Cu/Zr-SBUs. Since earlier studies have shown that both Cu-ZnO x and Cu/Zr-SBUs are active sites for methanol, and Cu/ZnO x @UiO-bpy catalysts show very high space-time yield and selectivity to methanol (Fig. 7 ). In order to further increase the activity of Cu/ZrO2 catalyst, the researchers usually strengthen the Cu/ZrO2 interaction by adding additives or improving preparation methods. Fornero et al. [70] found the gallium-promoted catalyst (Ga2O3/Cu/ZrO2) was 5-fold more active to methanol production (per catalyst specific surface) than Cu/ZrO2. In addition, after the incorporation of Ga2O3 the selectivity to the alcohol was enhanced by a factor of three. On the other hand, through contrasting with the sputter-grown method, Mayr et al. [71] found that chemical vapor deposition of Zr(O-tBu)4 on Cu samples led to a partially hydroxylated and fully oxidized Zr4+O x H y species, which exhibited a pronounced catalytic synergism between the ZrO x H y overlayer in the submonolayer and Cu. In summary, by adding additives, improving the preparation method or establishing a new catalysts structure, the methanol catalysts with high efficiency and stability can be obtained via enhancing hydrogen spillover, strengthening the interaction between components, and increasing the number of active sites at the interfaces. Senanayake et al. [72] and Kumari et al. [73] deposited the CeO x or ZnO nanoparticles on Cu(111) to produce highly active catalysts for methanol synthesis. Compared with ZnO/Cu(111), the apparent activation energy for the CO2 → CH3OH conversion significantly reduced in CeO x /Cu(111), while a novel carboxylates (CO2 δ−) intermediate occured in CeO x /Cu(111) and existed steadily at the interface of Cu(111) and CeO x , indicating that suitable oxide/metal configuration favored strong metal-oxide interactions, reduced reaction barrier and made more novel and efficient reaction pathways. Bao et al. [74] designed the Cu/TiO2 catalysts with anatase TiO2(001) nanosheets as support for the CO2 hydrogenation to the methanol. They found the calcination temperature had the important effect on the formation of Ti3+ which could enhance the effective adsorption and activation of CO2, and high calcination temperature and strong reduction atmosphere would lead to larger crystal size of Cu leading small surface area. In addition, adequate amount of Ti3+ and large specific surface area of Cu endowed the Cu/TiO2 catalysts highly efficient for methanol production. 2.1.3 Other Cu-based catalysts In addition to using metal oxide as catalysts supports, metal carbide, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) or graphene supported Cu-based catalysts, Cu-based alloy and copper-f block element bimetallic oxides also have the potential to be excellent catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. Vidal et al. [75] found that small Cu particles in contact with a TiC(001) surface undergo a charge polarization that makes them very active for CO2 activation and the catalytic synthesis of methanol. The binding energy of CO2 and turnover frequencies for methanol production on Cu/TiC(001) are much larger than on Cu(111), indicating that metal carbides can be excellent supports for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. Posada-Perez et al. [76] observed that the Cu/δ-MoC had higher turnover frequencies for methanol production than Cu/TiC(001). Moreover, the calculations indicate that the Cu/δ-MoC system works as a bifunctional catalyst, where the supported Cu clusters readily dissociate CO2 into CO and O, whereas both the clean regions of the δ-MoC substrate and the supported clusters catalyze the main hydrogenation steps toward methanol and water. Therefore, a new pathway for methanol synthesis via CO2 hydrogenation, which is different from formate pathway, has been developed in δ-MoC supported Cu-based catalyst. Wang et al. [77] and Sun et al. [78] found that the presence of nitrogen-containing groups on the CNTs surface could increase the dispersion of copper oxides, promote their reduction, decrease the crystal size of Cu, and enhance H2 and CO2 adsorption capability. The catalysts yielded high methanol activity with turnover frequency of 1.61 10−2 s−1 and space time yield of 84.0 mg gcat −1 h−1. They also found the pyridinic nitrogen on the CNTs was beneficial to the strong adsorption of CO2, thus stimulating methanol formation, and CNTs supported Cu/ZrO2 catalyst owned higher methanol yield (8.64%) and space time yield (102.21 mg gcat −1 h−1). Deerattrakul et al. [79] designed supported Cu-Zn/graphene aerogel catalyst in which the reduced graphene oxide aerogel (rGOae) was synthesized via hydrothermal reduction and following freezedrying method. The obtained performance of this work under low-operating pressure is higher than that of other previous published works. They found that rGOae synthesized at a hydrothermal reduction temperature of 140 °C possessed highest surface area (458 m2 g−1), and the result of in situ XANES proved that the oxidation states of Cu and Zn were close to Cu° and Zn2+ species at a reduction temperature of 350 °C for 90 min. Branco et al. [80] studied methanol formation using copper-f block element bimetallic oxides as catalysts for the first time, and found that the initial activity of all the catalysts were 2–9 times higher in comparison with the industrial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst and had fairly high methanol selectivity (>90%), suggesting the f-block metal elements were highly effective additives for Cu-based catalysts."
3,"Au, Ag catalysts","2.2 Au, Ag catalysts Many studies have shown that Ag and Au also have high reactivity in the preparation of methanol by CO2 hydrogenation. Hartadi et al. [81] firstly explored the effect of total pressure and influence of CO on Au/ZnO catalysts. Compared with industrial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts, high temperature and high pressure are beneficial to the increase of methanol yield, inhibit the relative activity of the RWGS and improve the selectivity to methanol and CO2 conversion. In addition, increasing CO concentration results in the decreasing methanol formation rate, and the rate of CO2 hydrogenation (in CO2/H2 mixtures) on Au/ZnO is considerably higher than the rate of CO hydrogenation (in CO/H2 mixtures). Therefore, CO2 is ‘directly’ hydrogenated to CH3OH and not converted to CO in a first step, followed by hydrogenation of adsorbed CO. Hartadi et al. [82] further explored the negative effects of the remaining CO. The researches proposed that CO2 was the preferred carbon source at lower temperature and higher CO2/CO ratios. A shift in the preferred carbon source for methanol from CO2 towards CO is observed with increasing reaction temperature between 240 °C and 300 °C. At even higher temperature CO is expected to become the dominant carbon source. Xiao and Frauenheim [83] investigated the CO2 hydrogenation on Ag(111)/ZnO(0001) surfaces via first principles calculations. The calculation results show that the addition of ZnO(0001) substrate to Ag(111) makes the Ag’s d-band states exceed the Fermi level. The binding ability between the supported Ag(111) monolayer and CO2 molecule significantly improves, and the CO2 reduction in the subsequent hydrogenation process is optimized as well. Therefore, the strong metal-support interaction between Ag and ZnO plays an important role to increase the catalytic activity."
4,"Pd, Pt and Ga catalysts","2.3 Pd, Pt and Ga catalysts In the noble metal series, Pd-based catalysts are the most commonly used because they exhibit considerable activity and selectivity for hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. Bahruji et al. [84] investigated structure activity relationships for CO2 hydrogenation on Pd/ZnO catalysts prepared by different methods. The results proved that the PdZn alloy which was formed during the reaction or high temperature pre-reduction greatly reduced CO production by RWGS reaction and became the active site for methanol synthesis. In addition, smaller PdZn alloy particle size, less surface metallic Pd content and higher surface area of PdZn alloy are beneficial to increase methanol selectivity. In order to further improve the catalytic performance of Pd/ZnO catalysts, TiO2 is selected as catalyst support. Highly dispersed Pd/ZnO supported catalyst with PdZn nanoparticles size of 3–6 nm was prepared via chemical vapour impregnation method by Bahruji et al. [85]. PdZn supported on TiO2 exhibits high methanol productivity that is associated with the high dispersion of the supported PdZn alloy. Díez-Ramírez et al. [86] studied the catalytic performance of Pd/ZnO catalysts supported on CNFs in the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol at atmospheric pressure. Compared with conventional Pd/ZnO catalysts, the higher PdZn alloy particle size caused by lower Pd/Zn molar ratio was propitious to improve CH3OH selectivity. The PdZn alloy supported on platelet CNFs had better catalytic performance. They further studied the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol at atmospheric pressure by using PdCuZn/SiC catalysts [87]. The results indicated Pd° active sites were related to CO formation via RWGS, whereas the PdZn alloys catalyzed methanol synthesis. The role of copper in trimetallic catalysts was to inhibit the deposition of metallic palladium by forming a PdCu alloy which was less active to CO formation. Qu et al. [88] prepared Ga2O3 supports with different polar facets with the same Pd contents to catalyze the methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation. The results of characterization and evaluation showed that the low indexed (002) polar Ga2O3 surface was highly unstable, which gave oxygen defects and mobile electrons in the conduction band more readily. The significantly strong metal-support interaction between the (002) polar Ga2O3 surface and Pd gave rise to higher metal dispersion and facilitated electron transfer between them, leading to the formation of methanol formation active site PdGa x alloy phase. Fiordaliso et al. [89] found that the GaPd2/SiO2 catalysts prepared by simple impregnation exhibited higher intrinsic activity and methanol selectivity than that of the conventional Cu/ZnO/Al2O3, which was mainly be attributed to the fact that strong metal-support interaction promoted the formation of GaPd2 alloy phase with specific active crystalline facets, as well as smaller particle size and higher dispersion. In order to enhance the contents of GaPd2 alloy nanoparticles in Pd/Ga catalysts, García-Trenco et al. [90] proposed pyrolysis-reduction method to prepare colloidal Pd/Ga catalysts for the liquid-phase production of methanol from CO2. In the first step, palladium acetate is thermally decomposed, in the presence of the gallium stearate precursor, leading to the formation of Pd(0) nanoparticles of 3 nm size. Then, the palladium nanoparticles mediate the hydrogen reduction of Ga(III) species, at 210–290 °C, leading to the formation of GaPd2 alloy nanoparticles with an average size of 5–6 nm. The new colloidal GaPd2 catalysts exhibited a 4-fold higher activity in comparison to that for Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 or Pd/ZnO catalysts, similar methanol selectivity and excellent catalytic stability at 210 °C and 5.0 MPa. It is proved that Ga can also be used as an active component for methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation. Sharafutdinov et al. [92] present a detailed study of the relationship between active components and product distribution in intermetallic Ni-Ga catalysts. The results show that the Ni5Ga3 phase is favorable for inhibiting methane generation and increasing methanol selectivity, and CH4 stems from the presence of the Ni-rich Ni3Ga phase which is produced on the adjacent Ni-Ni sites on the surface of Ni5Ga3. Studt et al. [91] also deemed that Ni5Ga3 was the active site of methanol with high selectivity and applied successfully in the reduction of CO2 using solar-generated hydrogen at ambient pressure (Fig. 8 ). In recent years, Pt-based and Pt alloy catalysts have attracted much attention. Kattel et al. [93] combined DFT calculations, KMC simulations and experimental measurements to investigate the catalytic conversion of CO2 by H2 on Pt NPs and supported Pd-based catalysts. DFT calculations show that corners and edges of the Pt NP are active for RWGS for the weak bonding with CO2. Using both SiO2 and defected TiO2 with oxygen vacancy as support, Pt NP can enhance the overall CO2 conversion via increased CO2 binding. The combined theoretical and experimental results indicate that the enhanced activity of Pt/oxide over Pt is originated from the sites at the Pt-oxide interface derived from the synergy between Pt and oxide. Khan et al. [94] prepared Pt3Co octapods with improved catalytic performance towards CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. The calculation and characterization results show that both the presence of multiple sharp tips and charge transfer between Pt and Co enable the accumulation of negative charges on the Pt atoms in the vertices of the Pt3Co octapods, and promote the activation of CO2 and enhance the catalytic activity (Fig. 9 )."
5,Other metal-based catalysts,"2.4 Other metal-based catalysts Liu and Liu [95] reported the methanol synthesis from CO2 and H2 on metal (M = K, Ti, Co, Rh, Ni, and Cu)-modified model Mo6S8 catalysts using DFT. The results show that the catalytic behavior of a Mo6S8 cluster is changed significantly due to the modifiers, via ligand effect and ensemble effect to promote some elementary steps and select reaction pathways. Therefore, selecting suitable additives can make Mo6S8 an excellent catalyst for the preparation of methanol by CO2 hydrogenation. Chen et al. [96] synthesized a series of M/Mo2C (M = Cu, Pd, Co and Fe) and evaluated for CO2 hydrogenation at 135–200 °C in liquid 1,4-dioxane solvent. The addition of Cu and Pd onto the high surface area Mo2C enhanced the production of CH3OH, and present excellent stability in the liquid environment. Zhang et al. [97] prepared Rh75W25 nanosheets for methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation. Compared with Rh nanoparticles, Rh nanosheets and Rh73W27 nanoparticles enhanced the adsorption and activation of CO2 because of their higher d-band center induced by one-dimensional quantum confinement and negatively charged Rh surface deriving from alloy effect. Moreover, the alloy effect provided more active sites for methanol formation. Richard and Fan [98] developed low-pressure methanol synthesis catalysts (NiaInbAl/SiO2; a = 0–8.3, b = 0–9.1), which contained Ni and In as cocatalysts and were synthesized via a phyllosilicate precursor. They found that catalysts with Ni/In ratios of 0.4–0.7 showed the highest activity. An activity of 0.33 mol h−1 (mol catalyst metal) −1 was obtained over Ni3.5In5.3Al/SiO2 with 15% metal loading in comparison to the benchmark Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts at 0.17. García-Trenco et al. [99] reported a bimetallic Pd-In catalyst synthesized by the thermal decomposition of two metallic precursors in a high boiling point solvent, followed by reduction using dilute H2 gas, which showed good performance for hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. They found the optimum Pd/In catalyst showed an improvement in stability, and improved methanol selectivity over the whole temperature range from 190 to 270 °C, reaching > 80% selectivity at 270 °C, compared to only 45% for the reference Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts. The optimum catalysts consist of ∼8 nm nanoparticles comprising a surface In-enriched PdIn intermetallic phase. Table 2 shows results for a selection of Au, Pd, NiIn and NiGa catalysts mentioned in Sections 2.2–2.4 for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol."
6,Oxide catalyst system,"Recently, more and more researchers focus on a high-temperature methanol synthesis catalyst as it can be coupled with zeolite catalyst for MTH to directly produce value-added hydrocarbons from CO2 hydrogenation, including high-octane gasoline (MTG process), ethylene and propylene in the MTO process. Compared with the indirect route, the direct conversion of CO2 into hydrocarbons is more economical and environmentally benign. The CC coupling from methanol is thermodynamically more favorable at high temperature (>320 °C), however, methanol synthesis is thermodynamically restrained at such high temperature. As mentioned above, two parallel reactions, methanol synthesis and RWGS, occur simultaneously during the CO2 hydrogenation process. The RWGS reaction is favored at higher temperature, since it is an endothermic reaction. The reaction temperature is usually relative low (200 − 300 °C) over methanol synthesis catalysts, while the zeolite is not active for the MTH reaction at such low temperature. The mismatch of their reaction temperatures results in the production of a large amount of CO. Therefore, one of the key challenges in the selective formation of hydrocarbons from CO2 hydrogenation over the bifunctional catalysts system is how to suppress CO formation."
7,In2O3 based catalyst,"3.1 In2O3 based catalyst The oxide catalysts based on new reaction mechanisms and catalytic structures have been developed in recent years. Ye et al. [100] predicted that methanol is the most favorable product on the defective In2O3(110) surface with surface oxygen vacancies and that the reaction follows a mechanism consisting the cyclic creation and annihilation of oxygen vacancies using periodic DFT calculations (Fig. 10 ). They found that the methanol formation mechanism on oxygen defective site was quite different from that of traditional Cu-based catalysts. Typically, CO2 hydrogenation to HCOO is both thermodynamically and kinetically favorable over the oxygen vacancies on the In2O3 surface, which can also stabilize the key intermediates involved in methanol formation, including HCOO, H2COO, and H2CO. In contrast, the H2CO and H2COO species are not stable on the Cu(111) surface. Martin et al. [101] prepared the In2O3-based catalysts and achieved the methanol generation mechanism proposed by Ye et al. [100] successfully. In2O3 showed 100% selectivity to methanol even at the high temperature (300 °C) under the reaction conditions of P = 5.0 MPa, H2/CO2 = 4:1, and GHSV = 16,000 h−1 (Fig. 11 ). In addition, the reaction rate over In2O3 decreased moderately in a H2O co-feeding CO2 hydrogenation experiment at 300 °C (molar ratio of H2O/CO2/H2 = 0.3:1:4). These strongly contrast to the conventional Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts, which is unselective and experiences rapid deactivation. Very recently, Gao et al. [102,103] combined In2O3 or In−Zr composite oxides with ZSM-5 and SAPO-34 zeolites to construct a bifunctional catalyst system that yielded a high selectivity (∼80%) to gasoline-range hydrocarbons (C5–C11) or lower olefins (C2–C4) with a low CO selectivity (<50%) directly from CO2 hydrogenation. In conclusion, the In2O3-based materials have emerged as a highly efficient catalytic system for high-temperature methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation. Ye et al. [104] further explored the effect of Pt cluster addition on In2O3 catalyst. The DFT study predicts that the addition Pt4 cluster results in the transition of the active site from the oxygen vacancy to the Pd4/In2O3 interface and the formate (HCOO) route is also the dominant pathway. The introduction of Pd can improve the catalytic performance by providing metal sites for H2 dissociative adsorption and interfacial sites for CO2 adsorption and hydrogenation. Rui et al. [105] prepared Pd/In2O3 catalyst by firstly mixing In2O3 powder with Pd/peptide composite (Fig. 12 ). The results show that both interfacial sites and the oxygen vacancy play important roles in the catalytic CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. The obtained catalyst exhibits a superior performance with CO2 conversion above 20%, methanol selectivity above 70% and space time yield up to 0.89 gMeOH h–1 gcat –1 at 300 °C and 5.0 MPa. Ghuman et al. [106] observed that the oxygen defective site derived from calcination process catalytic CO2 hydrogenation and the main product was CO. Experiments and DFT calculations show that the In atoms adjacent to the oxygen vacancies are easy to be hydroxylated. The hydroxyl oxygen and the exposed In atom adjacent to the oxygen vacancy act as Lewis base and Lewis acid respectively and heterolytic H2, followed by CO2 activation to obtain CO. Therefore, the O atoms of the CO2 molecule cannot fill in the oxygen vacancies, and the method of producing oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface determines the properties of oxygen vacancies, the catalytic properties and the product distribution."
8,ZnO based catalyst,"3.2 ZnO based catalyst ZnO is the earliest methanol synthesis catalyst and can produce methanol under high pressure of 20 MPa and temperature of 400 °C, which was discovered in 1923 by Waugh et al. [108]. In addition to ZnO, nonstoichiometric Zn-Cr spinel was reported as the active phase in methanol synthesis from the syngas. Song et al. [109] found that during calcination the forming a nonstoichiometric Zn-Cr spinel with an optimum amount of oxygen vacancies resulted in high activity in methanol synthesis. The Zn:Cr ratio affected the catalytic activity of the ZnO/Cr2O3 catalyst. Although the active ZnO/Cr2O3 catalyst for high-temperature methanol synthesis was extensively studied, there were few studies focused on the methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation. Gao et al. [103] used various metal oxides including Zn-Cr oxide as the active component for CO2 hydrogenation, and mixed it with the HZSM-5 to directly converted CO2 into liquid fuels. Recently, Wang et al. [107] reported a ZnO-ZrO2 solid solution catalyst, which showed methanol selectivity of 86 to 91% at a CO2 conversion of more than 10% under the conditions of 5.0 MPa, 24,000 mL g–1 h–1, H2/CO2 = 3:1 to 4:1, 320 to 315 °C. Interestingly, this catalyst also showed the resistance to sulfur-containing molecules in the stream with 50 parts per million (ppm) SO2 or H2S, which made the catalyst viable in industrial processes and superior to supported metal catalysts (Fig. 13 ). To understand the reaction mechanism on ZnO-ZrO2, the surface species evolved in the reaction were monitored by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy and DFT calculations were performed. It was concluded that CO2 hydrogenation to methanol on the surface of ZnO-ZrO2 was through the formate pathway (Fig. 14 ). In addition, the high methanol selectivity of ZnO-ZrO2 solid solution was attributed to the synergetic effect in H2 activation between the Zn and Zr sites, and the simultaneous activation of H2 and CO2 on the neighboring sites, Zn and Zr, respectively. Then, they fabricated a tandem catalyst by dispersing the ZnO-ZrO2 nanoparticles on the SAPO micrometer crystals for direct hydrogenation of CO2 to lower olefins [110]. The selectivity of lower olefins can reach to 80% among hydrocarbon products with low CO selectivity (<50%). Other ZnO based catalyst can also suppress the RWGS reaction at high temperature. Liu et al. [111] selected ZnGa2O4 with a spinel structure as the CO2-to-methanol active component and combined it with molecular sieve SAPO-34 to catalyze the direct conversion of CO2 to lower olefins. They proposed that the oxygen vacancies on ZnGa2O4 surfaces were responsible for CO2 activation, and the –Ga–O– and –Zn–O– pairs worked for H2 activation, generating H species (H*) for the activation of CO2 to CH3O* species. The methoxide species can be further hydrogenated to methanol (Fig. 15 ). The selectivity of C2–C4 olefins in hydrocarbons reached 86% with a CO2 conversion of 13% at 370 °C, and the selectivity of CO via the RWGS reaction was lower than 50%."
9,Other catalytic system with novel reaction mechanism and catalytic structure,"In view of the fact, the key of methanol synthesis via CO2 hydrogenation is optimizing the mode of CO2 activation and lowering the barrier energy of relative reactions. Inspired by the frustrated Lewis pairs' ability to both bind CO2 and dissociate H2 without the use of precious metals, Ye and Johnson [112] decided to try to use frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) as catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. Several possible LP functional groups P-BX2 are grafted on the organic ligand terephthalic acid of UiO-66 to form UiO-66-P-BX. In addition, they fixed the Lewis pair -BX2 on the organic linker 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxylate (BPDC) in UiO-67 by attaching a BX2 moiety at carbon C2, and replacing carbon C3 with N, forming UiO-67-NBX2 (X = CH3, F, CN, CF3 or NO2) [113]. The calculations indicate that this novel catalyst facilitates the heterolytic dissociation of H2 to generate hydridic and protic H atoms bounding to Lewis acid and base sites, respectively, which facilitates a series of simultaneous transfer of two hydrogens to produce methanol (Fig. 16 ): C O 2 ⟶ + H 2 HCOOH ⟶ + H 2 C H 2 ( OH ) 2 ⟶ - H 2 O C H 2 O ⟶ + H 2 C H 3 OH By adjusting the kind and intensity of acids and bases, the activity of catalyst and selectivity of methanol and the selectivity of combining with CO2 or H2 can be effectively adjusted to optimize the reaction mechanism and product distribution. At present, they only present a proof of-concept that the FLP-based catalysts can have both the potential to selectively adsorb CO2 from flue gas and convert the captured CO2 to methanol. There are many problems that need to be addressed to enable the catalyst to be practical and industrialized. In order to prepare methanol for CO2 hydrogenation at low-temperature and low-pressure, a lot of researchers have begun to explore the design and application of cascade homogeneous catalysis of CO2 hydrogenation. Huff and Sanford [114] exploited cascade catalysis for the homogeneous catalytic reduction of CO2 with H2 to produce CH3OH. They proposed a cascade catalysis sequence involving: (a) hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid, (b) esterification to generate a formate ester, and (c) hydrogenation of the ester to release methanol. The experimental results show that the most suitable catalysts for the above steps are (PMe3)4Ru(Cl)(OAc), Sc(OTf)3 and (PNN)Ru-(CO)(H) as catalysts respectively, and ROH also plays a catalytic role in the process of (b) and (c). Thompson et al. [115] described a novel heterogeneous cascade system for the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol through a formate intermediate. This system consisted of Cu-Cr (catalytic HCOOH+ROH→HCOOR+H2O) and Cu/Mo2C (catalytic HCOOR+H2→CH3OH+ROH) catalysts and yielded extremely high TOF value for CH3OH production at 135 °C, illustrating a suitable heterogeneous cascade catalytic system also has the potential to achieve low temperature CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, although the formation of formic acid in the first step still requires homogeneous catalysts."
10,Conclusions and future perspectives,"The reduction and fixation of CO2 into methanol have attracted tremendous interest to meet current energetic and environmental demands. The production of H2 is an essential element for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol and has significantly influence on the overall process energy efficiency. The estimated energy efficiency of nuclear energy assisted CO2 hydrogenation to methanol production process is lower than those of nuclear assisted coal to methanol and conventional coal to methanol processes, while the carbon efficiency is much higher. In the further, the nuclear to hydrogen efficiency should be increased [14]. In addition, the reaction at low temperature can enhance the energy efficiency of the CO2 hydrogenation to methanol process, however, it is still challenge due to the activation of CO2 at low temperature. Furthermore, the economics of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol production systems can be evaluated based on the reported economic model and the relevant parameters [14,116]. The unit cost of methanol for nuclear energy assisted CO2 hydrogenation to methanol production system is 9% higher than the cost for conventional methanol synthesis under carbon trading scenario. In order to make the CO2 to methanol economically competitive with the conventional methanol synthesis, the electricity price has to be in the range of 16.2–30.2 USD MWh–1. The other essential component for the chemical recycling of CO2 is catalysts system. Because CO2 is a very stable molecule with a bond length of 116.3 pm and a bond dissociation energy of 1072 kJ mol–1, a large energy input is required to transform CO2. High temperature facilitates CO2 activation, while the simultaneous formation of CO through the RWGS is the primary competitive reaction for methanol synthesis in CO2 hydrogenation. From the thermodynamic point of view, CO2 hydrogenation to methanol (Eq. (1)) is favoured by low temperatures and high pressures. For low temperature methanol synthesis, many researchers selected homogeneous catalysts to hydrogenate CO2 hydrogenation, which show satisfactory activity and selectivity, while the recovery and regeneration are problematic. Alternatively, heterogeneous catalysts are preferable in terms of stability, separation, handling, and reuse, as well as reactor design, which reflects in lower costs for large-scale productions [21,117–119]. A high methanol selectivity can be easily achieved under low temperature operation (<200 °C), however, it suffers from a dynamic limitation in CO2 activation. Compared with oxide catalyst system, the metal based catalysts usually exhibit much higher activity at low reaction temperature. In addition, metal based catalysts with ultrafine particle, higher metal dispersion, well-defined structure and stronger interactions between the major component and promoter possess higher activity, selectivity and stability in the CO2 hydrogenation. Apart from designing new structure catalysts, developing novel reactors is potential strategies for enhancing the reactivity and selectivity to methanol under mild reaction conditions. Using a dielectric barrier discharge, Wang et al. [120] developed a plasma-driven catalytic process for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol at room temperature (∼30 °C). The maximum methanol yield of 11.3% was achieved over the Cu/γ-Al2O3 catalyst with a CO2 conversion of 21.2% in the plasma process, while methanol selectivity of 53.7% was relatively low. Moreover, permselective membrane can remove the by-product water from the reaction systems in situ, which can break the reaction equilibrium. Commercially, methanol is produced from syngas with the tail-gas recycling, which is commonly used for a more efficient utilization of the feed. Even though various high-activity metal catalysts have been reported for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, the most methanol selectivity is lower than 60% under their reported conditions. However, the formed CO in tail gas can be recycled and modified copper based methanol catalysts are active for both CO2 and CO hydrogenation, which suggests promising prospects for industrial application. Compared with Cu-based catalysts, much higher methanol selectivity (>90%) can be obtained over In2O3/ZrO2 and ZnO-ZrO2 solid solution catalysts even the reaction temperature was above 300 °C, while CO2 hydrogenation conversion is lower. Furthermore, the oxide catalyst also shows the resistance to sulfur-containing molecules in the stream. The sulfur-containing molecules are always present in CO2 sources from flue gas produced from coal or biomass burning. Therefore, the high stability of the catalyst toward the sulfur-containing molecules makes the oxide catalyst superior to metal-based catalysts. Although a large number of works on catalytic CO2 hydrogenation to methanol have been done with experimental observations and theoretical analyses, the reaction mechanism is still in dispute. The future research should certainly emphasize on fundamental understanding regarding the nature of the active sites and interactions among active components, promoter, and support as well as reaction mechanisms, which play a critical role on the rational design of highly active catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation not only to methanol but also to other chemicals and fuels."
