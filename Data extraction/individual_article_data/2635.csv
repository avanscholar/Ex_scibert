0,Introduction,"Amines, which contain aryl and/or alkyl groups in their structure, are highly popular molecules as they involve as an intermediate for the production of many compounds such as polymers, dyes, drugs, pesticides, agrochemicals and antibacterials (Trasarti et al., 2014). The amines are part of natural products due to their antifungal and antibacterial effects (Xu et al., 2012). In this context, the isoquinolinamine salts and pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivatives exhibit antifungal and antibacterial effects, respectively (Wellington and Kolesnikova, 2012). Recently, due to the high biological activity of amine compounds, scientists have focused on the synthesis of amines under laboratory conditions (Wu et al., 2015). Amine derivatives are generally obtained by the hydrogenation of nitriles (Miecznikowski and Crabtree, 2004) or imines (Cabrita and Fernandes, 2011), hydroamination of olefins (Tsipis and Kefalidis, 2006), decarboxylation of carbamic acids (Ogo et al., 2004) and reductive aminations of carbonyl compounds (Ma and Lee, 2010). The synthesis of primary amine derivatives by hydrogenation of nitroarenes is quite common, and H2 pressure is generally used as a reducing reagent in the literature (Song et al., 2018; Begum et al., 2016). Moreover, high temperature is preferred, especially in reduction reactions under homogeneous conditions. In recent years, different reducing reagents such as alcohols (Sabater et al., 2012), sodium borohydride (Shokouhimehr et al., 2019), ammonia borane (Uozumi and Osako, 2018), formic acid (Babel and Hiran, 2020) are preferred due to the special system requirements in the reduction reactions carried out in H2 atmosphere. The reducing reagent alone cannot be effective in hydrogenation procedures. Of course, transfer hydrogenation reactions take place in the presence of homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts (Fountoulaki et al., 2014; Shil et al., 2012; Loghmani and Shojaei, 2014; Wolfson et al., 2009; Harraz et al., 2012). The homogeneous catalysts such as [(Cym)Ru(L)Cl]PF6 (Hohloch et al., 2013), Ni Colloid (Xu et al., 2007), VPy–NVP–Pd (Xu et al., 2000), PVPA-Pd (Xi et al., 2003) and [FeF(L2)][BF4] (Wienhöfer et al., 2013) have been used in the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline (see ESI,† Table S1). All these reactions were carried out at high temperatures and quantitative yields were obtained. Moreover, hydrogen atmosphere was used as the reducing reagent. On the other hand, palladium-containing catalysts are mostly preferred in terms of efficiency and reusability performance (Shah et al., 2015; Goksu et al., 2020; Goksu and Gultekin, 2017; Lolak et al., 2019; Diler et al., 2019; Bilgicli et al., 2020). It is a big disadvantage that the commercially available and stable structure of palladium dichloride does not dissolve in organic solvents. However, the complexes formed with organic molecules are soluble in organic solvents. BINAP.PdCl2 catalyst is air-stable and readily prepared from PdCl2. Palladium is, of course, a not cheap metal and its complexes cost is about £50–100 per gram-but very little amount of Pd complex is needed for a catalytic reaction (McGarry et al., 2016). Although a homogeneous catalyst such as BINAP.PdCl2 was preferred in the reduction of nitroarenes in this study, many heterogeneous catalysts were used by our group in previous studies (Goksu, 2015; Goksu et al., 2020). In addition, NaBH4 was used as the reducing reagent. The dehydrogenation reaction of NaBH4 in water is shown in Eq. (1) (Sahiner and Yasar, 2014). The sodium metaborate (NaBO2) formed by dehydrogenation of NaBH4 is a waste material used in the production of borosilicate glasses, antifreeze and herbicides. (1) NaBH 4 + 2 H 2 O → Catalyst NaBO 2 + 4 H 2 Herein, a new chemoselective methodology was reported for the hydrogenation of various nitroarenes with the help of commercially available BINAP.PdCl2 catalyst. The catalyst is a bulk catalyst and is in combination with coordination between Pd and ligand. The reactions with this catalyst are therefore valuable since it is also prone to asymmetric studies. The size of the catalyst is also important for the selectivity of the molecules in the reaction. Besides, the reactions were completed in 15 min using sodium borohydride in aqueous medium and under ultrasonic conditions."

4,General procedure for the BINAP.PdCl2 catalyzed hydrogenation of nitroarenes,"2.3 General procedure for the BINAP.PdCl2 catalyzed hydrogenation of nitroarenes First, 2.0 mg of BINAP.PdCl2 catalyst was dissolved in 1.0 mL of aqueous methanol at room temperature. Then, 0.25 mmol of nitroarenes was dissolved in 1.0 mL of aqueous methanol at room temperature. The two mixes were combined under ultrasonic conditions. Finally, the reaction started with the addition of 0.75 mmol NaBH4. The reactions were continued for 15 min. The synthesized products were purified using ethyl acetate/hexane solvent mixture and the products were identified by NMR analysis."
5,Results and discussion,"Under the influence of commercially available BINAP.PdCl2 catalyst, optimization studies have been carried out to reduce nitroarenes to primary amines. In this process, the 1-methyl-4-nitrobenzene compound was chosen. It can be seen in Table 1 that the amount of catalyst and NaBH4 was kept constant and reactions were carried out in different solvent and/or solvent mixtures (Table 1, entries 1–7). Reaction efficiency in methanol is quite high (Table 1, entry 1). The use of water as a solvent together with methanol further increases reaction performance (Table 1, entry 4). However, the excessive use of water decreases the reaction performance (Table 1, entry 5) and the high rate of methanol increases the reaction efficiency (Table 1, entry 7). This suggests that it is related to solubility, solvent-substrate compatibility, effective dehydrogenation of sodium borohydride and effective hydrogen gas concentration in the solution medium. After the solvent tests, the amount of sodium borohydride was kept constant and the amount of catalyst was reduced. There was no significant change in reaction yield (Table 1, entry 8). Then the amount of catalyst was kept constant and the amount of sodium borohydride was reduced, and a significant decrease in efficiency was observed (Table 1, entry 9). In these trials that brought us closer to the end, only the amount of catalyst was reduced and the final procedure was created.0.25 mmol of the substrate, 2.0 mg of catalyst, and 0.75 mmol of NaBH4 gave an adequate performance for the conversion of nitroarenes into primary amines with 2 mL of H2O/MeOH (v/v = 1/4) (Table 1, entry 11). However, if there is no catalyst in the reaction medium, the reaction does not take place (Table 1, entry 12). Ultrasonic conditions (100 W, 50 Hz) were used to accelerate the reaction and improve reaction performance. Ultrasonic conditions are the biggest handicap of the industrial dimension of this method. However, it is the biggest advantage of the reactions taking place at lower temperatures in shorter times. The reduction of 1-methyl-4-nitrobenzene was accomplished with a 66% yield within 15 min (Table 1, entry 13). Compared to the previously published studies on the reduction of nitro benzene to aniline using homogeneous catalysts. The developed method is advantageous in terms of the reaction time, temperature and efficiency (see ESI,† Table S1). The many nitroarene compounds were tried for the hydrogenation to the respective amines with remarkable yields in 15 min under ultrasonic conditions (Table 2 ). The BINAP.PdCl2 was also very active in catalyzing the hydrolysis of NaBH4. 6-nitro-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxine (1), 3-nitro-9H-fluorene (5), and 2-chloro-5-nitropyridine (9) were transformed to respective amine compounds (2, 6, 10) with the yields higher than 95% within 15 min (Table 2, entries 1, 3, 5). 2-nitro-9H-fluorene-9-one (3) was converted to 2-amino-9H-fluorene-9-one (4) under ultrasonic conditions (Table 2, entry 2). However, the carbonyl group was not reduced due to conjugation (Fig. 1 ). 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene (7) was reduced to 2-bromoaniline (8) (Table 2, entry 4). The aniline (12) was obtained with the yields higher than 97% (Table 2, entry 6). The nitroarenes derivatives including electron-donor groups such as methoxy (-OCH3), hydroxy (-OH), alkyl (-R) and amino (-NH2) at different points of the molecule were also reduced to the primary amines in enormous yields within 15 min (Table 2, entries 7–13). Moreover, the reduction of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (27) was reduced to 4-bromoaniline (28) (Table 2, entry 14). 4-nitrophthalonitrile (29) and 4-nitrobenzonitrile (31) were optionally reduced to the corresponding primary amines (Table 2, entries 15, 16). The catalyst selectively reduced nitro groups. Surprisingly, the benzonitrile (33) was reduced under the same conditions in low yields. Because the catalyst selectively reduces nitro groups (Table 2, entry 17). The separation of product and catalyst is carried out by column chromatography in ethyl acetate/hexane mixture. It is possible to reuse the catalyst after isolation. Consequently, the catalyst can be used over and over without a serious decrease in the yields of amino compounds as shown in Table 3 . In Fig. 2 , It appears that the hydrogen atoms which are transferred to the palladium in the complex structure by dehydrogenation of sodium borohydride are effective in reduction of the nitroarenes. The effect of the catalyst in breaking the H–H bond in H2 formed by the dehydrogenation of NaBH4 and transferring the hydrogen atoms to reduce the nitro compound cannot be discussed. The nitroso intermediate formed in the reduction step is converted to arylamines and re-formed in the hydrogenated complex structure in a new hydrogenation process. This formation not only ensures the catalytic use of the catalyst but also helps to reuse it after isolation (Fukuzumi et al., 2011)."
6,Conclusions,"In summary, the commercially available Pd catalyst is very effective in converting nitroarenes to primary amines as a homogeneous catalyst, and the re-use of the catalyst and maintaining the metal content in the complex is a significant event in terms of stability. The catalytic reactions were run in the aqueous medium under ultrasonic conditions (100 W, 50 Hz). The developed method has been tested on some nitroarenes and the reactions have been completed with tremendous yields and short periods of time. However, if nitro and nitrile groups were present in the molecule at the same time, only nitro groups were reduced chemoselectively. The developed chemoselective method is also important for the scientific community and the chemical industry as it is an environmentally friendly and cost-effective method. In the near future, this type of catalyst may be beneficial for other organic reactions."
