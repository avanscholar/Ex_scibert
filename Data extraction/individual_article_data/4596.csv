0,Introduction,"As a crucial clean and renewable resource, biomass can be converted into various fuels and value-added chemicals through fast pyrolysis technology, which is of great significance to alleviate the energy crisis and environmental pollution [1–3]. Lignin is one of the three primary components of lignocellulosic biomass, and it is generally composed of three phenylpropane units, i.e., p-hydroxyphenyl (H-type), guaiacyl (G-type), and syringyl (S-type) units. These units are interconnected by the ether and CC linkages [4,5]. In the pyrolysis process of lignin, different linkages will break to produce a variety of phenolic products [6]. Within suitable catalytic or other methods, valuable phenolics can be selectively prepared, such as phenol [7], 4-ethylphenol (4-EP) [8], 4-vinylphenol (4-VP) [9], etc. However, the advancement of pyrolysis techniques is significantly limited by the finite knowledge of the pyrolysis mechanism. Due to the diversity of linkages and substituents [4,5,10], the structure of lignin is very complex, and the related pyrolysis mechanisms have not been clarified thoroughly. Among these linkages, the β-O-4 linkage is most abundant in natural lignin. It usually accounts for more than 50% [5,11], which can well represent the natural structure of lignin and the significant source of phenolics. Therefore, most of the researches on the lignin pyrolysis mechanism are focused on the β-O-4 type model compounds [12–14]. In the early studies of the β-O-4 type lignin pyrolysis, only the ideal unimolecular decomposition mechanisms were concerned, including concerted and homolytic reactions. Taking the simplest β-O-4 type lignin dimer phenylethyl phenyl ether (PPE) as an example, its unimolecular decomposition mechanism can be classified into two concerted reactions (the Maccoll elimination and the retro-ene fragmentation) [15,16] and two homolytic reactions (the C β –O homolysis and the C α –C β homolysis) [17,18], as shown in Fig. 1 (A). The concerted reactions result in the direct generation of stable products by breaking the C β –O bond, which is accompanied by the hydrogen transfer from C α to O/C3. Differently, free radicals are produced through the homolytic breakage of the C β –O or C α –C β bond. When abundant hydrogen radicals exist in the pyrolysis system, these homolytic radicals (derived from homolytic reactions) can be further hydrogenated to form stable products. Otherwise, they will polymerize into char. However, the unimolecular mechanism cannot match well with the actual pyrolysis process of lignin, when considering the source of H radicals and the rearrangement process of the methoxy group, etc. According to the previous studies [17,19], the R–H bond dissociation energies (BDE) of lignin are very high. Hence, there are only very limited H radicals that can be provided for the unimolecular hydrogenation reactions of those homolytic radicals. In addition, there are plenty of methoxy groups on the aromatic rings of lignin, which may decompose through the demethoxylation or the CO bond rearrangement pathway [20]. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate an advantage of the former over the latter, whereas the pyrolysis experiments give an opposite conclusion. In fact, lignin and its derived intermediates, radicals, and products are coexisting in the same pyrolysis system. Therefore, there are complex intermolecular interactions, which greatly affect the whole pyrolysis process. In view of the possible interactions in lignin pyrolysis, the hydrogen abstraction mechanism has been proposed to explain the bimolecular reactions between lignin molecules and their homolytic radicals [21,22]. As shown in Fig. 1(B), homolytic radicals can be stabilized by directly abstracting the H radicals on lignin molecules (PPE as an example), rather than coupling with dissociative H radicals in the pyrolysis system. Benefiting from the bimolecular hydrogen abstraction, the decomposition of lignin is continuously promoted [19]. Based on the synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry experiments and DFT calculations of guaiacol (a G type lignin monomer model), Dai et al. [20] claimed a methyl radical-induced CO rearrangement through the hydrogen abstraction interaction. This hydrogen abstraction interaction process is more favorable than the CO rearrangement initiated by unimolecular dehydrogenation, which can explain the relatively high yield of the CO bond rearrangement products to a certain degree. Notably, the methyl radicals are initially derived from the homolytic demethylation of guaiacol, which is a limitation for the initiation of the hydrogen abstraction. Apart from the lignin molecules (the pyrolysis feedstock), the primary products in lignin pyrolysis can also act as the H radical donors for hydrogen abstraction, as proved by Jiang et al. [19]. In addition to free radicals, the lignin pyrolysis products, especially the phenolic compounds which bear hydroxyl groups, may also participate in the decomposition of lignin by intermolecular interactions to affect the pyrolysis process, but related work has been rarely reported. Britt et al. [18] found that p-phenylphenol can improve the decomposition of PPE based on their co-pyrolysis experiment. They proposed the hydrogen bond-induced homolysis mechanism, as shown in Fig. 1(C). In the proposed mechanism, the phenolic hydroxyl group can form a hydrogen bond with the ether oxygen atom to promote the C β -O bond homolytic reaction of the β-O-4 structure. However, there is no relevant theoretical calculation to confirm Britt's viewpoint at present. Because the hydrogen bond is difficult to form steadily at medium and high temperatures, the correctness of this mechanism remains doubtable. Both interactions in the lignin pyrolysis shown in Fig. 1(B) and (C) are based on radical reactions. Concerted reactions are also very important for lignin pyrolysis, especially for the cleavage of the β-O-4 linkages, but no interaction mechanism has been proposed for concerted pyrolysis reactions at present. During our investigation, we find a novel concerted reaction-based interaction where the nearby products can assist the hydrogen transfer process of the concerted pyrolysis reactions, as depicted in Fig. 2 . The molecule A–B departs into two fragments through an intramolecular hydrogen transfer from fragment A to fragment B (A→B). In the novel interaction mechanism, another molecule C can act as the mediator to change the hydrogen transfer process into A→C→B. Similar mechanisms have been confirmed important for holocellulose pyrolysis. The work of Seshadri and Westmoreland [23] provided a good enlightenment. They proposed the ROH-assisted mechanism, which can explain how the holocellulose breaks down through this kind of bimolecular pericyclic reactions. Similarly, OH-containing pyrolysis products such as methanol [24], acetic acid [25], water [26], and adjacent reactant units [27] were all reported being able to participate in the hydrogen transfer process of the concerted reactions in holocellulose pyrolysis. Besides, a similar hydrogen transfer mechanism has also been found in other fields [28,29]. As for lignin pyrolysis, related research about the pyrolysis-products-assisted hydrogen transfer (AHT) has not been reported at present. So far, significant details of the lignin pyrolysis mechanism have been gained based on both computational and experimental approaches. The DFT-based quantum chemical calculation is an effective theoretical tool for the pyrolysis mechanism investigation on biomass components and other organic compounds at the micro-level [30–32], which cannot be achieved by conventional experiments. Due to the highest proportion of the β-O-4 structure in lignin, PPE, the simplest β-O-4 type dimer, is conveniently used to investigate the interaction mechanism [18,19]. This paper will take PPE as a model compound to explore the possible interactions based on the pyrolysis products-AHT in the lignin pyrolysis system through DFT calculations, electrostatic potential (ESP) analyses, and fast pyrolysis experiments. Furthermore, the relationship between the pyrolysis products-AHT mechanism and other mechanisms will also be clarified to give a clearer and more comprehensive understanding of the β-O-4 type lignin pyrolysis mechanism."
1,Methods,
2,DFT calculation,"2.1 DFT calculation All calculations were completed by using the Gaussian 16 B01 program [33]. Geometry optimizations of the reactants, products as well as transition states were first performed by employing the hybrid density functional RM06-2X with the 6-311G(d,p) basis set, while the unrestricted M06-2X was employed for the free radicals. Moreover, frequency analysis was conducted at the same computational level to guarantee that the transition states contained only one imaginary frequency, while the reactants, intermediates, and products at minimum points had no imaginary frequencies. Afterward, intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) analyses were further performed to verify the identified transition states connecting the corresponding reactants and products in the elementary reactions. The energy barriers are estimated by energy differences between transition states and reactants. However, there are no saddle points on the potential energy surfaces (PES) for the homolytic reactions, which makes it impossible to find their transition states. Hence, BDE is approximately used as the energy barrier to estimate homolysis [34]. The enthalpy at 298.15 K is executed as the calculation basis of the reaction energy barrier [5,35]. The corresponding results of Gibbs free energy barriers are shown in Table S1."
3,ESP analysis,"2.2 ESP analysis Electrostatic potential method was used to predict whether two molecules can approach each other through electrostatic attraction at the early stage of chemical reactions [36,37]. Calculations of ESP were carried out by Multiwfn [38] using the wavefunctions generated at the RM06-2X/6-311G(d,p) level in the Gaussian 16 package. It is easy to estimate the electrostatic potential of different regions outside the molecule via the visual molecular dynamics (VMD) program [39]."
4,Fast pyrolysis experiments,"2.3 Fast pyrolysis experiments The materials employed in the pyrolysis experiments included PPE (>98%), phenol (>99%), and ethylbenzene (>99.5%), which were all provided by Aladdin Company. The fast pyrolysis experiments were conducted by using a horizontal fixed bed, as described in Fig. 3 . In order to reduce the influence of the volatilization of phenol, a semi-closed quartz capsule with a hole was used to hold reactants. In each experiment, the quartz reactor was preheated at 600°C by an electrical heating furnace. The quartz capsule was pushed into the reaction zone when the pyrolysis temperature reached 600°C. N2 was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 50 mL/min. The pyrolysis vapor was condensed by liquid nitrogen. The liquid product was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC1690)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Interaction mechanism based on the products-AHT,"3.1 Interaction mechanism based on the products-AHT According to the unimolecular mechanism shown in Fig. 1(A), it has been confirmed that PPE breaks its β-O-4 bond through both concerted Maccoll elimination and retro-ene reactions, and the homolytic reactions of the C β -O and C α -C β bonds. Only the concerted reactions involve the hydrogen transfer process, that is to say, the products-AHT merely affects the concerted reactions. Based on the previous literature [15,16,40], the pyrolysis of PPE mainly produces phenol, styrene, and a small amount of ethylbenzene, toluene, benzene, etc. The typical ion chromatogram of fast pyrolysis for PPE at 600°C is shown in Fig. S1. These products can be classified into three categories according to the types of side chains, i.e. phenolic hydroxyl product (phenol), alkenyl product (styrene), and alkyl products (toluene and ethylbenzene), which can represent the typical structures generated in the lignin pyrolysis system. In the subsequent sections, the roles of the three kinds of typical products, together with PPE, are examined for their interactions involving the concerted hydrogen transfer by DFT calculations. 3.1.1 Effect of the products-AHT on the Maccoll elimination In this section, DFT calculations are carried out for the Maccoll elimination reaction of PPE to investigate the hydrogen transfer processes assisted by the above four typical products. To be rigorous, interactions between two PPE molecules, which also have the alkyl structure, are considered as well. The related reaction transition states and energy barriers are shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1 , respectively. The unimolecular Maccoll elimination involves a four-membered transition state with the C α hydrogen transferring to ether O, and the energy barrier is 259.6 kJ/mol. As for the bimolecular interactions, the products and PPE participate in the hydrogen transfer process through their side-chain functional groups. Firstly, for phenol that bears a hydroxyl group, it assists the hydrogen transfer process of the Maccoll elimination through its hydroxyl group. The hydroxyl O is the intermediary atom of the hydrogen transfer mediator. The energy barrier of this interaction is 181.2 kJ/mol, which is 78.4 kJ/mol lower than that of the unimolecular Maccoll elimination. Secondly, styrene can provide the C α or C β hydrogen of its vinyl group to participate in the hydrogen transfer process, where C α or C β serves as the intermediary atom. The energy barriers of these two interactions are very close (~320 kJ/mol), which are approximately 60 kJ/mol higher than that of the unimolecular Maccoll elimination. Similar to styrene, the alkyl products (toluene and ethylbenzene), and PPE mediate the hydrogen transfer process via the alkyl H at the C α or C β site. The C atom is also the intermediary atom for the alkyl-AHT. The energy barriers of these interaction reactions involving the alkyl C α atom are around 10 kJ/mol higher than that of styrene, and those involving the alkyl C β atom are even higher (>30 kJ/mol). According to the above calculation results, the changes of the Maccoll elimination energy barrier resulted from three kinds of products-AHT are in the order of phenolic hydroxyl < 0 < alkenyl < alkyl. Therefore, only phenolic hydroxyl-AHT can reduce the energy barrier of the Maccoll elimination, while alkyl and alkenyl structures have the opposite effects. That is to say, only the phenolics can facilitate the concerted Maccoll elimination by assisting its hydrogen transfer process. 3.1.2 Effect of the products-AHT on the retro-ene fragmentation DFT calculations have also been conducted to explore the products-AHT of the retro-ene fragmentation. Figure 5 illustrates the corresponding reaction processes and energy barriers. The unimolecular retro-ene fragmentation involves the hydrogen transfer from C α to C3 with a six-membered transition state. The energy barrier is 232.6 kJ/mol, which is lower than that of the unimolecular Maccoll elimination. According to the DFT calculation results, even if phenol participates in the hydrogen transfer process of the retro-ene fragmentation, the reaction energy barrier still increases 7.6 kJ/mol, rather than decreasing. Phenol plays the same role in the interaction process as that in the Maccoll elimination, which also uses the O atom as the intermediary atom to assist the hydrogen transfer. However, the transition state changes from six- to eight-membered ring, which may produce an additional tension, ultimately leading to the increase of energy barrier. It indicates that the interaction based on products-AHT can barely happen for the retro-ene fragmentation reaction in the PPE pyrolysis system. 3.1.3 Principle analysis of the products-AHT mechanism In order to further reveal the mechanism of the bimolecular interactions involving the products-AHT, ESP and geometric analyses are conducted by focusing on the different roles of side-chain structures in phenol, toluene, and styrene, as well as the distinction between Maccoll elimination and retro-ene fragmentation. Firstly, the electronic structures of transition states are evaluated by the ESP analyses to understand why the products-AHT processes involving toluene and styrene as mediators are different from that of phenol. The van der Waals surface electrostatic potentials of PPE, phenol, styrene, and toluene are calculated, as shown in Fig. 6 . According to the ESP results, the hydroxyl H of phenol brings about a quite positive potential value of 2.287 eV, which is much higher than those nearby the vinyl H of styrene and the methyl H of toluene (0.612 eV and 0.513 eV, respectively). What's more, the hydroxyl O of phenol corresponds to the most negative EPS surface (−1.158 eV). On the contrary, the potential value near the C β atom of styrene is −0.465 eV, and toluene has almost no negative potential distribution near the methyl group. It is worth noting that the moduli of positive and negative potentials have the same order of phenol >> styrene > toluene, which exactly corresponds to the energy barriers of the interactions involving these products. PPE and phenol attract each other via the strong electrostatic attraction between the hydroxyl oxygen atom of phenol and the α-hydrogen atom of PPE as well as that between the hydroxyl hydrogen atom of phenol and the ether oxygen atom of PPE, which offers potential for the occurrence of the bimolecular interaction through the phenol-AHT. In contrast, the electrostatic attraction between styrene/toluene and PPE is much weaker, which is not enough to counteract their repulsion force. It results in the reaction energy barrier not falling but rising and the impossible interaction. As is well known, electrostatic potential is a reflection of electron density. Because the electronegativity of oxygen is very large, the electrons on the OH bond of phenol are mainly distributed on the oxygen side, which leads to a large positive and negative potential distribution around the hydroxyl H and O, respectively. Nevertheless, the electronegativity of carbon is much smaller and the electrons on the CH bond are more evenly distributed, making the positive and negative potential distributions around carbon less significant. Hence, the phenolic hydroxyl group is crucial for the bimolecular interaction based on products-AHT. In other words, this concerted interaction can be defined as phenolics-AHT interaction. Apart from the important role of the electrostatic attraction, the ring tension, and steric hindrance in the transition states also greatly affect the hydrogen transfer processes of the concerted bimolecular interactions. Figure 7 shows the angles at the transferred hydrogen sites of transition state rings, including the unimolecular Maccoll elimination and retro-ene reactions, as well as the bimolecular interactions between PPE and phenol. For the unimolecular Maccoll elimination, the angle of Cα–H–O in the quaternion transition state is 130.74°, whereas those of Cα–H–O’ and O’–H’–O are 164.22° and 158.98° respectively for the bimolecular interaction due to the transformation of the transition state from four- to six-membered ring. It is evident that the angle of hydrogen transfer becomes larger in the phenol-AHT process, which leads to the decrease of the ring tension and ultimately the reduction of the energy barrier. However, the unimolecular retro-ene fragmentation possesses a six-membered transition state, whose hydrogen transfer angle (C α –H–C3) is 160.93°. When a phenol participates in its hydrogen transfer process via an eight-membered transition state, the angles of hydrogen transfer (Cα–H–O’ and O’–H’–C3) are 167.98° and 173.97°, respectively. Obviously, the relaxation of the transition state ring tension for the bimolecular retro-ene reaction is not as much as that of the bimolecular Maccoll reaction. The increase of the steric effect between two benzene rings enhances the repulsive force, which results in rising instead of falling energy barrier for the bimolecular retro-ene reaction. As a result, only for the bimolecular Maccoll elimination, where the ring tension is lessened, the phenol-AHT process is favorable to occur. All in all, owing to the stronger electrostatic interaction as well as the lower transition state ring tension and steric hindrance, phenol can accelerate the Maccoll elimination reaction by assisting the hydrogen transfer process, whereas bimolecular interactions are less likely between other products and PPE or for the retro-ene fragmentation. 3.1.4 Other interaction reactions based on the phenolics-AHT mechanism In order to further examine the rationality and reliability of the interaction based on the phenolics-AHT, the bimolecular Maccoll elimination reaction assisted by other common phenolics and interactions based on other typical concerted reactions are explored by DFT calculations. The energy barriers and structures of the transition states are shown in Table 2 and Fig. S2, respectively. First, common phenolic, such as guaiacol, 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, 4-EP, and 4-VP feasibly acts as the hydrogen transfer mediator for the Maccoll elimination reaction. The energy barriers of the bimolecular interactions decrease by 78.7–92.0 kJ/mol compared with the unimolecular reaction (Table 2). Secondly, another four typical concerted reactions involving the participation of phenolics are also considered, including decarbonylation, decarboxylation, dehydration, and tautomerization. On the basis of previous unimolecular calculation models [41,42], the above four concerted reactions are represented by decarbonylation of benzaldehyde, decarboxylation of benzoic acid, dehydration of 1-phenylpropanol, and tautomerization of 2,4-cyclohexadienone intermediate. It can be found that bimolecular interactions involving the phenol-AHT all have much lower energy barriers than the unimolecular reactions correspondingly. As a result, the phenolics-AHT process is relatively universal for different phenolics and diverse concerted reactions in lignin pyrolysis."
7,Other interaction mechanisms,"3.2 Other interaction mechanisms Apart from the interaction mechanism based on the phenolics-AHT, it has been claimed that the hydrogen abstraction and hydrogen-bond-induced homolysis mechanisms may also exist in the pyrolysis system of PPE. The rationality of hydrogen abstraction has been confirmed by pyrolysis experiments and theoretical calculations [17,19,43]. Nevertheless, the hydrogen-bond-induced homolysis proposed by Britt et al. [18] remains to be further explored, especially to be verified theoretically. Moreover, a hydrogen bond may induce the concerted decomposition reactions in a similar way to the radical reaction-based homolytic decomposition. In order to clarify whether the phenolics-AHT reaction coexists with the other two kinds of interaction reactions in the lignin pyrolysis system, the following sections will concentrate on the hydrogen-bond-induced homolytic and concerted decomposition as well as hydrogen abstraction reactions of PPE to further improve the interaction mechanism system at a theoretical level. 3.2.1 Hydrogen-bond-induced decomposition mechanism in PPE pyrolysis Based on the unimolecular pyrolysis mechanism of the β-O-4 type lignin dimer (Fig. 1(A)), four kinds of main decomposition reactions of PPE are considered under the induction of hydrogen bond between phenol and PPE. The related reaction energy barriers are shown in Table 3 . Compared with the unimolecular reactions of PPE, the energy barriers of the hydrogen-bond-induced Maccoll elimination, C β –O homolysis, and C α –C β homolysis all increase, and only that of the retro-ene reaction slightly decreases (~8 kJ/mol). There is no doubt that the hydrogen bond between the phenolic hydroxyl H of phenol and the ether O of PPE not only cannot promote the radical reaction-based homolytic breakage of the β-O-4 bond, but also has no clear effect on the concerted reactions. Moreover, hydrogen bonds cannot exist stably in the pyrolysis condition of 600°C. Even the hydrogen bonds formed at room temperature must be broken at the beginning of pyrolysis, which is impossible to act on the whole reaction process continuously. Hence, the viewpoint that hydrogen bond is formed between phenolic hydroxyl and ether oxygen atom to promote the decomposition of the β-O-4 linkage, put forward by Britt et al. [18], cannot give a reasonable explanation to the intermolecular interaction between the β-O-4 type lignin model compounds and phenolics. 3.2.2 Hydrogen abstraction mechanism in PPE pyrolysis According to previous studies [17,19,43], hydrogen abstraction can affect the pyrolysis processes of both lignin molecules and their primary products. In order to further interpret the role of this interaction, the hydrogen abstraction and following decomposition mechanism of PPE pyrolysis will be discussed in this section from the perspectives of the hydrogen abstraction reactions involved in both lignin model molecules and pyrolysis products. Based on the unimolecular homolysis mechanism shown in Fig. 1(A), PPE is most likely to produce phenoxy radical (r1) and β-phenylethyl radical (r2) through the C β -O homolysis. These radicals may grab the H radical at the α or β site of PPE. Figure 8 demonstrates the energy barriers of the related hydrogen abstraction triggered by r1 and r2 as well as the decomposition of dehydrogenated radicals of PPE. Firstly, α- or β-dehydrogenated radical of PPE (r α or r β ) is generated through the hydrogen abstraction interactions, where r1 and r2 convert into phenol (p1) and ethylbenzene (p2), respectively. Afterward, α- and β-dehydrogenated radicals of PPE tend to break their β-O-4 bonds and decompose into styrene and new phenoxy radical (r1) by about 94 kJ/mol. Compared with the unimolecular pyrolysis reactions of PPE (>230 kJ/mol, Table 3), it is obvious that the hydrogen abstraction mechanism has a great advantage for the lignin pyrolysis. Undeniably, it is difficult to produce homolytic radicals in the initial pyrolysis process of lignin due to the high homolytic energy barriers (>289 kJ/mol, Table 3). Fortunately, the hydrogen abstraction and subsequent radical decomposition reactions can also produce new radicals for continuous interaction. In short, this interaction based on hydrogen abstraction plays a vital role in the lignin pyrolysis in the presence of sufficient free radicals. In addition, the homolytic radicals can also participate in the hydrogen abstraction reactions with primary products (mainly phenol for PPE). According to Fig. 9 , the hydrogen abstraction between β-phenylethyl radical (r2) and phenol (p1) is quite favorable (16.7 kJ/mol) with the formation of ethylbenzene (p2) and a new phenoxy radical (r1). In fact, there are competing relationships for the hydrogen abstraction interactions between homolytic radicals and lignin molecules as well as those between homolytic radicals and primary products in the pyrolysis system. Compared with the hydrogen abstraction interactions with PPE (>29.5 kJ/mol, Fig. 8(A) and (B)), the calculations in Fig. 9 distinctly suggest that phenol is more preferred as the H donor for hydrogen abstraction in PPE pyrolysis. Hence, the hydrogen abstraction mechanism not only indirectly promotes the decomposition of lignin, but also directly affects the product distribution."
8,Experimental results,"3.3 Experimental results Co-pyrolysis experiments of PPE and phenol were further conducted to verify the phenolics-AHT interaction. According to the above DFT calculation results, the bimolecular Maccoll elimination is very typical and favorable by involving the phenol-AHT process. The Maccoll elimination leads to the formation of phenol and styrene from the decomposition of PPE. Because phenol is also one of the reactants in the co-pyrolysis, the peak area values of styrene and ethylbenzene are selected as the evaluation standard to judge the decomposition degree of PPE based on the phenol-AHT and hydrogen abstraction, respectively. Figure 10 compares the peak area values of unreacted PPE, styrene, and ethylbenzene in the individual pyrolysis of PPE and co-pyrolysis of PPE and phenol. The addition of phenol results in a decrease of the unreacted PPE and an increase of styrene. The above results firmly evidence that phenol does interact with PPE to facilitate the formation of styrene, which is consistent with the interaction mechanism based on the phenolics-AHT. Meanwhile, the C β -O homolysis and following hydrogen abstraction lead to the formation of ethylbenzene, which has also been confirmed by the above DFT calculation. According to Fig. 10, the peak area value of ethylbenzene increases after adding phenol, clearly indicating that the presence of phenol also promotes the formation of ethylbenzene through the hydrogen abstraction based interaction."
9,Discussion,"3.4 Discussion The above computational and experimental results clearly demonstrate that the phenolics-AHT and hydrogen abstraction mechanisms coexist in the PPE pyrolysis system. Nevertheless, the hydrogen-bond-induced decomposition mechanism is not reasonable and logical. Firstly, according to DFT calculations and ESP analyses, phenol can accelerate the decomposition of PPE by bimolecular interaction, where the phenolic hydroxyl assists the hydrogen transfer process of the Maccoll elimination. This interaction processes a lower reaction energy barrier, compared with the unimolecular concerted reaction. As a result, the breakage of the β-O-4 bond is facilitated, leading to a promotion to the generation of phenol and styrene (Fig. 4 and Table 1). Secondly, the homolytic radicals (phenoxy and β-phenylethyl radicals) can participate in the dehydrogenation of PPE by hydrogen abstraction. In this way, these homolytic radicals indirectly facilitate the β-O-4 bond cleavage. In the meantime, phenol can also act as an H donor for the hydrogen abstraction interaction to promote the ethylbenzene formation (Fig. 9). Finally, the co-pyrolysis experimental results are consistent with the theoretical analyses that the extra addition of phenol increases the amount of styrene and ethylbenzene in the PPE pyrolysis system. Owing to the implausible hydrogen-bond-induced mechanism, adding phenol does not improve the homolysis of PPE to increase the radical concentration. Moreover, the phenolic hydroxyl H is more easily abstracted by homolytic radicals than the α- or β-H of PPE. Hence, the formation and subsequent decomposition of the dehydrogenation radicals of PPE is hindered when adding extra phenol to the PPE pyrolysis system. Although extra phenol accelerates the transformation from β-phenylethyl to ethylbenzene, it also limits the production of styrene through the hydrogen abstraction and following decomposition reactions on PPE. It indicates the increase of styrene in the co-pyrolysis experiment is mainly due to the promotion to the Maccoll elimination reaction of PPE through the phenol-AHT process. Besides, ethylbenzene cannot be produced by the concerted decomposition reactions of PPE directly. Hence, it is the hydrogen abstraction reaction between phenol and β-phenylethyl radical that contributes to the increase of ethylbenzene. Although both the phenolics-AHT and hydrogen abstraction reactions can directly or indirectly facilitate the β-O-4 bond cleavage, their acting patterns are different. Also, the two kinds of interactions are competing with each other. Since both of them are bimolecular reactions, they are limited by the amount of phenolics and radicals in the pyrolysis system, respectively. Compared with the four kinds of unimolecular reactions of PPE in Table 3, the concerted reactions have significantly lower energy barriers than homolytic reactions. It is strongly supported that the concerted reactions are dominant in fast pyrolysis at medium temperatures, although both the concerted reactions and homolytic reactions may occur in the early stage of PPE pyrolysis [15,17]. Similar results were also reported by Jarvis et al. [40] who claimed that the C β -O homolysis of PPE became significant only when the temperature exceeded 1000°C, and that the superior position of concerted reactions kept unchanged regardless of the influence of substituents on the β-O-4 structure [44]. Generally, plenty of phenolics can be generated by the concerted reactions, hydrogen abstraction reactions, and phenolics-AHT reactions in PPE pyrolysis. As a result, the formation of phenolics will correspondingly promote the β-O-4 bond breakage by assisting the concerted hydrogen transfer process. However, the amount of radicals derived from the homolysis is relatively limited at medium temperatures, which makes the hydrogen abstraction less important. In other words, the interactions based on the phenolics-AHT require easier conditions to be triggered than those based on the hydrogen abstraction. On the basis of the above analyses, a relatively complete pyrolysis mechanism system for the β-O-4 linked lignin is summarized, as shown in Fig. 11 . The corresponding discussion is as follows. (1) The initial breakage of the β-O-4 linkage can be initiated by the unimolecular concerted reactions or homolysis reactions. (2) The homolytic radicals derived from the initial pyrolysis of lignin can participate in the hydrogen abstraction based interaction, which further induces the formation of dehydrogenated radicals of lignin to facilitate the breakage of the β-O-4 bond. Furthermore, the primary products compete with the reacted lignin to act as H donors for the hydrogen abstraction. (3) Besides the hydrogen abstraction, the interaction involving the phenolics-AHT can also occur in lignin pyrolysis, which can promote the breakage of the β-O-4 bond by reducing the energy barrier of the Maccoll elimination reaction. (4) The mechanisms of hydrogen abstraction and phenolics-AHT coexist in lignin pyrolysis, which can respectively trigger the radical and concerted reactions to decompose the β-O-4 structures in different ways. However, these reaction processes are largely limited by the concentration of interactive reactants (radicals and phenolics, respectively) in the lignin system, because they both belong to bimolecular reactions. When the pyrolysis temperature is not high, there are fewer radicals generated in the lignin pyrolysis system due to the disadvantage of unimolecular homolysis. On the contrary, phenolics can be easily formed through both radical reactions and concerted reactions at medium temperatures, resulting in stronger competitiveness for the phenolics-AHT. In a word, the phenolics-AHT mechanism can have a more significant impact on the pyrolysis of β-O-4 type lignin than the hydrogen abstraction mechanism at medium temperatures. In addition, according to the calculation results in Section 3.1.4, the phenolics-AHT can affect not only the cleavage of the β-O-4 bond but also the other types of concerted reactions in lignin pyrolysis, such as decarbonylation, decarboxylation, dehydration, and tautomerization. Moreover, it can be inferred that the alcohol hydroxyl structure with oxygen as the hydrogen transfer intermediary atom may also assist the hydrogen transfer process of the concerted reactions, based on the analysis in Section 3.1.3. In addition, various substituents and linkage structures in lignin may have a significant influence on the phenolics-AHT interactions. Further efforts are needed to explore other possible interactions involving the phenolics-AHT."
10,Conclusions,"A novel lignin pyrolysis interaction mechanism, where phenolics assist the hydrogen transfer process of the concerted pyrolysis reactions, known as phenolics-AHT, was found and explored by combining DFT calculations, ESP analyses, and fast pyrolysis experiments. The main conclusions are as follows. The phenolics derived from lignin pyrolysis can affect the pyrolysis process of lignin by bimolecular interactions. Their phenolic hydroxyl can assist the hydrogen transfer process of the Maccoll elimination and reduce the energy barrier of the β-O-4 bond decomposition. The hydroxyl oxygen is the intermediary atom when phenolics serve as the mediator for the concerted hydrogen transfer process. Due to the large electronegativity difference of oxygen and hydrogen, the hydroxyl oxygen has a large negative potential and the hydroxyl hydrogen correspondingly brings about a strong positive potential, which results in a strong electrostatic attraction between the β-O-4 structure and phenolic product. The more intensive electrostatic attraction and the less strained transition state structure make the intermolecular interaction easier. Besides, phenolics can also facilitate the hydrogen transfer process of the concerted decarbonylation, decarboxylation, dehydration, and tautomerization through similar bimolecular interactions. However, because of the tensile structure of the transition state, phenolics have no significant effect on the hydrogen transfer of the retro-ene fragmentation reaction. Different from phenolic products, the alkyl and alkenyl products, such as toluene, ethylbenzene, and styrene, cannot influence the pyrolysis of lignin by assisting the hydrogen transfer process, owing to the weak electronegativity of the intermediary C atoms. The hydrogen abstraction and phenolics-AHT coexist in the same pyrolysis process of lignin, which can facilitate the decomposition of the β-O-4 bond by initiating the radical reaction-based and concerted reaction-based interactions, respectively. Under the condition of medium and low temperature pyrolysis, the possibility of homolysis is too low to produce enough free radicals, making the hydrogen abstraction mechanism less competitive. Conversely, the phenolics-AHT mechanism plays a more important role in lignin pyrolysis, in virtue of the high content of phenolics. In summary, a more comprehensive pyrolysis mechanism system of the β-O-4 type lignin is established, composed of the unimolecular homolytic and concerted reactions, bimolecular hydrogen abstraction as well as phenolics-AHT interaction reactions. Generally, the present work can provide a reliable theoretical foundation for the study of complicated interactions in lignin pyrolysis. More accurate and complete investigations are required in the future to explore the phenolics-AHT, as there are various substituents and linkage structures in lignin."
