0,Introduction,"As a consequence of huge consumption of petroleum and coal, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has greatly risen in recent 100 years, resulting in temperature increase at the rate of 0.8 °C per year at least [1]. So green fuels are of great necessity. Lignocellulose, generated by photosynthesis, harbors the carbonaceous subcomponents, including cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. About 150 × 109 billion tons of lignocellulose is obtained per year on the earth [2]. Lignocellulose has characteristics that are environmental-friendly and abundant in yield. Thus, it is a promising material for producing fuels and chemicals [3–7]. Owing to numerous hydroxyl groups and ether bonds existing in lignocellulose, deoxygenation was crucial for producing fuels. Beside the complete removal of oxygen, the partial removal of oxygen for lignocellulose was also a good option. On one hand, some oxygenated compounds could be blended with hydrocarbons to improve octane number of gasoline [8]. On the other hand, oxygenated compounds improved soot-NOx trade-off and engine efficiency in the case of diesel combustion [9,10]. Consequently, low-oxygenated bio-fuel was an ideally alternative fuel. Two-step approach (i.e., first step, liquefaction; second step, catalytic hydrogenation) could effectively generate high quality bio-fuels [11–13]. This kind of approach made it easier to fulfill deoxygenation because the obstruction has been shared by two steps. The tractable liquid bio-crude was produced from solid lignocellulose with ultra-high molecular weight in the first step [14] and the quality of bio-fuels was improved via lowering its oxygen content in the second step [15]. Hydrothermal liquefaction (water–ethanol as solvent) was one of the most common liquefaction methods to produce bio-crude. This method often involved a high bio-crude yield (40–60 wt%) because high temperature environment (>300 °C) was beneficial to cleavage of chemical bonds in lignocellulose and ethanol was used to supply hydrogen to suppress condensation and reploymerization of big fragments [16,17]. Water was also considered as a potential hydrogen origin and could provide supplementary hydrogen origin for liquefaction [17–19], particularly when water–gas shift reaction was involved, if catalyst (e.g., CuZnAl) was added [20]. However, high temperature and solid residue discharge (variable: 10–35 wt%) [16,17] eroded the advantages of hydrothermal liquefaction, such as high bio-crude yield. Therefore, our first objective of the present work was to improve the aforementioned hydrothermal liquefaction (water–ethanol as solvent) by making as the lowest LSR as possible on the premise of maintaining high bio-crude yield via two strategies (i.e., strategy one: low-temperature reaction with long-time compensation; strategy two: enhancing the hydrogen donating ability of solvent via introduction of water–gas shift reaction catalyst). Catalytic hydrogenation involving with noble mental catalysts [21–23] or non-noble mental catalysts [24–26] was commonly used to serve deoxygenation purpose. The hydrogenation accompanied with the utilization of noble metal catalysts (Pt, Ru, and Pd, etc.) and molecular hydrogen often represented good deoxygenation performance. For instance, lignocellulose or derivative bio-fuel was converted into alkanes with noble metal catalyst/H2 [21–23]. However, hydrogenation process involving hydrogen gas possessed high explosion danger [27], especially under high temperature. Furthermore, noble metal catalysts were often expensive. CuZnAl/MeOH was a promising alternative to noble metal catalysts/H2 because CuZnAl was a commercialized catalyst using cheap non-noble metals [28] and also an efficient catalyst to release hydrogen from MeOH with low-risk [29]. CuZnAl/MeOH was introduced in present study to export hydrogen for deep deoxygenation. In addition, cooperative Ni/HZSM-5 was tentatively added in order to improve hydrogen utilization efficiency, because the ability of hydrogen activation of Ni/HZSM-5 was as distinguished as noble catalysts like Ru/C and Pt/C [30]. Besides catalyst, the categories of solvents used in catalytic hydrogenation process had a significant effect on deoxygenation of bio-oil [11]. The catalytic hydrogenation of bi-oil in alkanes tended to produce alkanes [11,31]. By contrast, the catalytic hydrogenation of bi-oil in alcohols was more likely to produce oxygenated chemicals [11,32]. The second objective of the present work was to investigate the feasibility of deep deoxygenation using CuZnAl/MeOH, with the possible aid from Ni/HZSM-5 and/or co-solvent (MeOH/n-C6H14)."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Lignocellulose (pinewood, 100 meshes maximum) was provided by Qingdao Shike Co., Ltd. HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 18) was purchased from Nankai catalyst Co., Ltd. All organic and inorganic reagents used in this work were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Furthermore, all reagents were analytic grade and used as received."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation Three sorts of Cu-based catalysts were synthesized in this paper. The Cu-based catalysts used in first stage were labelled as CuZnAl-1 and CuZnMgAl-1, respectively. The Cu-based catalyst used in second stage was labelled as CuZnAl-2. The precise compositions and synthetic conditions of CuZnAl-1 and CuZnAl-2 were chosen according to literatures [20,28] for efficient performance of water–gas shift reaction (CuZnAl-1) and methanol synthesis (CuZnAl-2), respectively. For the CuZnAl-1: Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (2.99 g), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (2.26 g), Al(NO3)3·9H2O (7.50 g) were dissolved in 100 mL de-ionized water. Na2CO3 (2.12 g) and NaOH (8.00 g) were separately dissolved in 100 mL de-ionized water. After that, metal salt solution was added dropwise to Na2CO3 solution. At the same time, NaOH solution was also added to keep the pH of the slurry at 10 in the condition of 30 °C and under vigorous stirring. The light-blue slurry was aged at 30 °C under stirring for 24 h. The precipitate was filtered and washed with de-ionized water until the filtrate reached a pH of 7. The solid was dried for 12 h at 110 °C and crushed into a powder (100 meshes maximum). The powder was calcined at 500 °C for 5 h in the air with a 3 °C min−1 temperature ramp. Finally, green solid catalyst was obtained. For the CuZnMgAl-1: the preparation procedure of CuZnMgAl-1 was the same as that of CuZnAl-1, except that 20 mol% Zn was substituted by Mg. So, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (2.99 g), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (1.81 g), Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (0.39 g), Al(NO3)3·9H2O (7.50 g) were used. For the CuZnAl-2: the preparation procedure of CuZnAl-2 was the same as that of CuZnAl-1, except that Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (14.49 g), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (8.92 g), Al(NO3)3·9H2O (3.75 g), Na2CO3 (3.18 g) and NaOH (12.00 g) were used. Finally, dark solid catalyst was obtained. Ni/HZSM-5 was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method. The mass of Ni loaded on HZSM-5 was 20% of the Ni/HZSM-5 mass."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted on X’pert PRO MPD diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (10 kV, 40 mA) with a scanning angle from 5 to 80°. The adsorption and desorption of N2 was measure by an adsorption analyzer (Micromeritics 3-Flex 3500). Before that, the catalyst was outgassed at 300 °C for 6 h. Then the experiment was conducted at 77 K. The surface was calculated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. And the pore volume and diameter were calculated by Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. Temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) was measured to determine the acidity of CuZnAl-1 and CuZnMgAl-1. The catalyst (approximately 50 mg) was placed in a flow of 40 mL/min helium at 500 °C for 0.5 h to desorb the impurity gas. Then the catalyst was cooled to 50 °C and exposed to a flow of 40 mL min−1 NH3 (5% NH3 in He). After that, the catalyst was swept with He for 0.5 h to remove physisorbed NH3. At last, desorption was carried out from 50 to 500 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The amount of absorbed of NH3 was measured by a TCD detector."
5,Liquefaction experiment,"2.4 Liquefaction experiment For the liquefaction experiments, the solvent/biomass ratio, ethanol/water ratio and catalyst/biomass ratio used in this study were recommended by Gollakota et al [33]. A low temperature (250 °C) was chosen in the study according to the designment. A relatively long reaction time (i.e., 12 h) was thus used to compensate liquefaction effect. 2.4.1 Liquefaction procedure Lignocellulose (6.00 g), H2O (24.00 g), and EtOH (36.00 g) were put into an autoclave (100 mL) and CO or N2 (5 MPa) was pressured into the autoclave. If necessary, CuZnAl-1 or CuZnMgAl-1 (0.6 g) was also added. Then the reactor was sealed and heated from room temperature to 250 °C with a 10 °C min−1 temperature ramp. The reaction time was maintained for 12 h under vigorous stirring at 800 rpm to improve liquefaction effect. After the reactor was cooled down by icy water, reaction mixture was separated by a series of operations (as seen in Fig. S1). The liquefaction reactions were labelled as reaction 1-1, reaction 1-2, reaction 1-3, reaction 1-4, reaction 1-5, reaction 1-11, reaction 1-12, and reaction 1-13. The first number referred to the first stage reaction (liquefaction) and the second number was the serial number for liquefaction reaction. The acquired bio-crudes were labelled as BC-1-1, BC-1-2, BC-1-3, BC-1-4, BC-1-5, BC-1-11, BC-1-12, and BC-1-13, respectively. BC referred to bio-crude, while the number referred to the corresponding liquefaction reaction. The information of reactions in detail, such as reaction conditions, was shown in Table 1 . 2.4.2 Evaluation procedure of hydrogen-donating ability of liquefaction reaction systems H2O (24.00 g) and EtOH (36.00 g) were put into an autoclave (100 mL). CO or N2 (5 MPa) was then pressured into the autoclave. If necessary, CuZnAl-1 or CuZnMgAl-1 (0.6 g) was also added. The reactor was sealed and heated from room temperature to 250 °C with a 10 °C min−1 temperature ramp. The reaction was maintained for 12 h under vigorous stirring at 800 rpm. After the reactor was cooled down by icy water, the gas product was collected for GC analysis. The analysis in detail was shown in Section 2.6. For this evaluation, five reactions were designed. They were labelled as reaction 1-6, reaction 1-7, reaction 1-8, reaction 1-9, and reaction 1-10, respectively. The first number referred to the first stage reaction (liquefaction) and the second number was the serial number for evaluation reaction. The information of reactions in detail, such as reaction conditions, was shown in Table 1."
6,Hydrogenation experiment,"2.5 Hydrogenation experiment BC from liquefaction, solvent(s) and catalyst(s) were sealed in a 100 mL autoclave under N2 atmosphere. The hydrogenation reaction was conducted at a given time and a specified temperature, as shown in Table 6. When the reaction finished, the autoclave was quenched by icy water. Then the mixture inside was separated and purified by sequential operations (as seen in Fig. S2). The hydrogenation reactions were labelled as reaction 2-1, reaction 2-2, reaction 2-3, reaction 2-4, reaction 2-5, reaction 2-6, reaction 2-7, and reaction 2-8. The first number referred to the second stage reaction (hydrogenation) and the second number was the serial number for hydrogenation reaction. The acquired low-oxygenated bio-fuels were labelled as LOBF-2-1, LOBF-2-2, LOBF-2-3, LOBF-2-4, LOBF-2-5, LOBF-2-6, LOBF-2-7, and LOBF-2-8. LOBF referred to low-oxygenated bio-fuel, while the number referred to the corresponding hydrogenation reaction."
7,Product analysis,"2.6 Product analysis The elemental compositions of BCs, LOBFs and bio-chars were analyzed by an Elementar Vario EL analyzer. The higher heating value (HHV) was calculated by Dulong equation [34]. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to roughly describe the boiling range of BC, as suggested by Wang et al. [35] The analysis was carried out on an integrated thermal gravimetric analyzer (Linseis TGA PT 1600, Germany). The BC sample (100 mg) was heated from room temperature to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a flow of nitrogen (80 mL min−1). Gas products were analyzed by GC (SCION GC 456) to identify the categories of gases and quantify components using external standard method. The temperature of the columns was set at 50 °C and the temperature of detectors was maintained at 250 °C. The LOBFs and BC were analyzed by two-dimensional gas chromatography time of mass spectrometry (GC × GC-TOF-MS, Agilent 7890B GC and Hexin EI-0620 TOF-MS) for accurate identification of products and semi-quantitative analysis of various products. The GC was equipped with two columns for separation. DB-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) was used for the first dimension and DB-17MS column (0.8 m × 0.18 mm × 0.18 μm) was used for the second dimension. The injector was maintained at 280 °C. The column was kept at 50 °C for 1 min, raised at 6 °C min−1 to 296 °C and held for 5 min. A matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) was employed to characterize the change in molecular weight. Before the operation, the samples were dissolved in ethanol. The instrument (Bruker Reflex II MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer, Germany) was operated at a plus rate of 3 Hz with a N2-laser (λ = 337 nm) and an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. A micro channel plate detector was used to detect the ions at positive model."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Liquefaction experiment,"3.1 Liquefaction experiment 3.1.1 The effect of CO pressure on products distribution (CO/H2O/EtOH System) As depicted in Table 2 , in CO/H2O/EtOH System, around 55 wt% of bio-crude, more or less, was acquired in five liquefaction reactions with rather low yields of LSR, compared to that from Cheng et al. [10]. It was indicated that a low-LSR liquefaction of lignocellulose with acceptably high yield of bio-crude could be achieved under low temperature, as long as long reaction time served. Noticeably, as the increase of CO pressure from 1 MPa to 5 MPa, the yields of BC and LSR increased and decreased respectively. This could be explained because of hydrogen from water-gas shift reaction suppressing the condensation and polymerization of big fragments. After that, when CO pressure was further increased to 9 MPa, the yields of BC and LSR almost kept unchanged. This may be because excess hydrogen from water-gas shift reaction did not participate in liquefaction reaction. As a whole, it could be found that 5 MPa CO was the optimum condition for liquefaction in CO/H2O/EtOH System. 3.1.2 Evaluation of Hydrogen-donating ability of various liquefaction reaction systems In order to further investigate the effect of CO (or water–gas shift reaction), the hydrogen-donating ability of the reaction system was evaluated using the content of generated hydrogen (V%) as a criterion. And reaction 1-6 (without water–gas shift reaction), reaction 1-7 (including water–gas shift reaction), and reaction 1-8 (improving the depth of water–gas shift reaction by the addition of CuZnAl-1) were conducted. As seen in Table 3 , the hydrogen content was rather low in the reaction 1-6, in which N2 atmosphere was involved. It indicated that the hydrogen-donating ability of this system was weak and hydrogen was probably generated from the ethanol thermal decomposition in only minor quantities [36]. When CO was introduced in the reaction 1-7, both the hydrogen content and CO2 content increased evidently as seen in Table 3. Generally, water–gas shift reaction was unlikely to occur at 250 °C unless catalyst or catalytic substance was involved. Because of the presence of Fe element from the reactor and H2O contained in the used solvent, a hypothesis was proposed. The contact of H2O with metal surface of reactor might form Fe3O4 [18,19]. It was supported by the fact that the inside surface of autoclave wall and stirrer became slightly dark after reaction. If so, the claimed Fe3O4 would have the ability to catalyze water–gas shift reaction and thus generate detectable H2, as suggested by Baldychev et al. [37]. To verify this hypothesis, a verification experiment (i.e., reaction 1-10) was performed. The resultant solid substance was sent for XRD analysis. It was evidently shown that Fe was considerably converted into Fe3O4, as seen in Fig. 1 , which rationalized the evident increase of H2 and CO2 content in reaction 1-7 under CO atmosphere, even without apparent catalyst. It was implied that the reaction system (CO/H2O/EtOH System) would be conducive to liquefaction of lignocellulose via self-formed catalytic substance. In addition, the H2 content and CO2 content tremendously raised along with the fall of CO content when catalyst (CuZnAl-1) and CO were employed simultaneously in the reaction 1-8. It was strongly suggested that water–gas shift reaction occurred and the potential hydrogen-donating ability of reaction 1-8 system was the highest. 3.1.3 Products distribution of various liquefaction reaction systems The LSR yield and bio-crude yield were inferior probably because of the lowest hydrogen-donating ability for reaction 1-11. It was implied that the stabilization of big fragments generated in liquefaction was the worst. As seen in Table 4 and Fig. 2 , the oxygen content and the distillation fraction distribution of BC-1-11 were similar to that of BC-1-3. It indicated that hydrogen delivered from reaction 1-3 was used more likely for stabilizing big fragments rather than deoxygenation [38], although hydrogen delivered from reaction 1-3 was higher than that of reaction 1-11. These stabilized big fragments would thus become a part of bio-crude instead of LSR, resulting in increment of bio-crude yield and reduction of LSR yield, as shown in Table 4. The evaluation of hydrogen-donating ability suggested that even though the hydrogen-donating ability of the reaction 1-8 was highest, the yield of BC-1-12 was lowest. The oxygen content of BC-1-12 was lower than that of BC-1-11 and BC-1-3. The yield of light fraction (boiling range: ~200 °C) of BC-1-12 was fairly higher than that of other two BCs. Furthermore, the higher the oxygen content of the BC was, the more heavy fraction (350~ °C) of the BC was (BC-1-11 and BC-1-3), as shown in Table 5 and Fig. 2. It was suggested that the donated hydrogen in the reaction 1-12 was probably used for not only stabilizing big fragments, but also deoxygenation. Thus, the decrease of BC-1-12 yield could be partially ascribed to the relatively deeper deoxygenation of BC-1-12. Furthermore, sugars/polyols component was more likely than BC to be converted from cellulose and hemi-cellulose, as a result of the presence of CuZnAl-1 [39,40]. It was proved by the evident increment of sugars/polyols yield in reaction 1-12, as seen in Table 4. Besides, the acid sites of CuZnAl-1 (as supported in Fig. S5) might lead to the formation of LSR. To verify this speculation, CuZnAl-1 catalyst was further modified by alkaline earth metal, i.e., Mg, labelled as CuZnMgAl-1, to reduce acid sites, as shown in Fig. S6. The results showed that even if the hydrogen-donating ability of reaction 1-13 was lower than that of reaction 1-12, the LSR yield of reaction 1-13 was lower. It was in line with reference [41], indicating that acid catalyst contributed to LSR formation during liquefaction. Through the above analysis, compared to reaction 1-11, BC yield increased and LSR yield decreased in reaction 1-3 because water–gas shift reaction was involved. However, efficient hydrogenation via the catalyst failed, although CuZnAl-1 was an efficient catalyst to produce hydrogen through water–gas shift reaction in reaction 1-12. It was proved by the fact that the oxygen content of BC had no immense change after the addition of CuZnAl-1, as seen in Table 5. This was consistent with the finds from previous works [39,40,42,43] that hydrogenation performance of Cu-based catalysts was limited at low temperature range (200–250 °C) even with a large dosage of catalyst. It was suggested that improving the depth of water–gas shift reaction by the addition of CuZnAl-1 could not obtain very ideal result (high BC yield, extremely low LSR yield, and rather low oxygen content of BC). However, non-catalytic liquefaction in the first stage evidently took over its responsibility of liquefaction and deoxygenation as a result of low extent of water–gas shift reaction occurring, as shown in Tables 3–5. In summary, it was found out that reaction 1-3 would fit within the liquefaction request for the highest BC yield, the lowest LSR yield and no usage of catalyst. Therefore, the corresponding resultant BC-1-3 was selected as the feedstock used at the second stage for further hydrogenation."
10,Hydrogenation of BC,"3.2 Hydrogenation of BC 3.2.1 Effect of reaction conditions The hydrogenation experiment was employed for the sake of further depolymerization and deoxygenation. As seen in Table 6, the amount of formed coke was remarkable (approximately 26 wt%) in the blank experiment (reaction 2-1, 310 °C, MeOH as solvent), although there was a reduction in oxygen content, as shown in Table 7 . By contrast, individual CuZnAl-2 or Ni/HZSM-5 had a better performance for deoxygenation without coke formation (Table 6, reaction 2-2 and 2-3; Table 7, LOBF-2-2 and LOBF-2-3). In the case of reaction 2-4, the dominant CuZnAl-2 catalyst aided by Ni/HZSM-5 was used. Interestingly, the results showed that the oxygen content of LOBF-2-4 was lower than that of LOBF-2-2 (Table 7, LOBF-2-4 and LOBF-2-2). It was suggested that the addition of Ni/HZSM-5 to CuZnAl-2/MeOH was conducive to deoxygenation. Furthermore, n-C6H14 was also tentatively added to CuZnAl-2/MeOH (i.e., Table 6, reaction 2-6). The oxygen content of resultant LOBF-2-6 decreased to 12.28 wt%, which was also lower than that of LOBF-2-2, as seen in Table 7. Even though n-C6H14 has no ability to supply hydrogen under the circumstance, the addition of n-C6H14 indeed favored the hydrogenation. This could be ascribed to the solvent effect [11]. As the ratio of n-C6H14 to MeOH was further increased, the oxygen content of resultant LOBF-2-5 was lower (9.81 wt%) than that of LOBF-2-6 (12.28 wt%) at the expense of the yield reducing of LOBF and marked coke formation (16.18 wt%). This further reduction of oxygen content of LOBF should be ascribed to the formation of massive coke, which was proved by the oxygen content (15.14 wt%) detected in the corresponding coke (Table S4). Based on findings above, a pair of verification reactions (reaction 2-7 and reaction 2-8) were implemented. As seen in Table 6, the coke yield reached 30 wt%, while the LOBF yield fell to the lowest (22.35 wt%) in the case of reaction 2-7 because a higher temperature (330 °C) and a longer reaction time (6 h) were used, and no catalyst was involved. Notably, no coke was detected in the case of reaction 2-8, while the oxygen content of resultant LOBF-2-8 remarkably decreased to 7.79 wt% using CuZnAl/MeOH for hydrogenation with the aid from Ni/HZSM-5 and n-C6H14. The HHV of LOBF-2-8 thus raised to 40.92 MJ kg−1. And the LOBF-2-8 yield also kept on a relatively high plane. 3.2.2 GC × GC-TOF-MS analysis of LOBFs and BC GC × GC-TOF-MS was thus used to identify accurate chemical compositions of BC-1-3, LOBF-2-7, and LOBF-2-8 for better insight of deoxygenation. As shown in Table 8 , the BC-1-3 mainly contained three kinds of components, including AEAKAEs (alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, ketones,acids, esters), phenols (guaiacol-type phenols and syringol-type phenols), and FAEEs (fatty acid ethyl esters). The LOBF-2-7 mainly contained three kinds of components, including AEAKAEs, phenols and FAMEs (fatty acid methyl esters), as seen from Table 9 and Fig. 3 a, while the LOBF-2-8 mainly contained two kinds of components, including hydrocarbons and polymethylphenols, as seen from Table 10 and Fig. 3b. These findings were consistent with the oxygen contents of BC-1-3, LOBF-2-7, and LOBF-2-8 (Table 5 and Table 7). It was indicated that upgrading BC-1-3 with methanol only cannot change chemical compositions. But after catalytic hydrogenation process, chemical compositions were changed and low-oxygenated or non-oxygenated components appeared. Mainly, hydrogenation for producing hydrocarbons and alkylation (methylation) for producing polymethylphenols were involved in the catalytic hydrogenation process for producing LOBF, as presented in Fig. 4 and stated by Shi et al and Bernt et al [44,45]. For the production of hydrocarbons: the AEAKAEs were probably converted into hydrocarbons via direct hydrogenation, while the FAEEs were converted into hydrocarbons most likely because hydrogenation of these occurred on Ni/HZSM-5 [46,47]. The alkylated aromatic hydrocarbons were possibly produced from phenols through hydrogenation and alkylation [45,48]. The hydrocarbons of LOBF-2-8 were composed of C7–C16 components. In all components, C8, C9, C10, and C11 were dominant components, accounting for 93.62%, as seen in Fig. 5 and Table S5. And the hydrocarbons mainly harboured alkanes (aliphatic hydrocarbons and naphthenes), alkenes, aromatic hydrocarbons, as depicted in Table S5; For the production of polymethylphenols: alkylation was also a vital reaction that could be catalyzed by HZSM-5 to produce polymethylphenols. Through the alkylation of phenols from BC, methyl groups from MeOH became a part of LOBF [45,48]. As a result, the carbon content and hydrogen content of LOBF increased, while the oxygen content of LOBF decreased indirectly. The proportion of tetramethylphenol in the LOBF-2-8 was much higher, accounting for 57.29%, compared with that of LOBF-2-7, as shown in Table 11 . Meanwhile, the LOBF-2-7 still contained phenol, as seen in Table 11. It was suggested that MeOH not only served as hydrogen donator, but also reacted with phenols of BC to provide methyl groups as import carbon source. Therefore, LOBF-2-8 yield could remain relatively high (as seen in Table 6) probably due to alkylation (methylation), even if a large proportion of the oxygen in LOBF-2-8 was removed (Table 7). 3.2.3 MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of LOBFs and BC After monitoring the reaction behavior of small molecules by GC × GC-TOF-MS, the change of big fragments during catalytic hydrogenation reaction was also observed to understand the holistic reaction process by MALDI-TOF-MS. It was demonstrated that the distributions of relative molecular mass had no big difference between big fragments of the LOBF-2-7 and those of the BC-1-3, as seen in the Fig. 6 a and b. The red numbers marked in Fig. 6a and b were extremely similar, for example, 914 and 921, 1088 and 1104. And fragments with similar relative molecular mass were likely to possess a similar chemical structure except the differences of small groups [49,50]. Thus, upgrading with MeOH only (Table 6, reaction 2-7) may only had a little impact on big fragments. In the Fig. 6c, no big fragments appeared probably because of further depolymerization and cracking during hydrogenation. It was indicated that the products were all small molecules without big fragments in the LOBF-2-8, which was rationalized by the finding from Ma et al [49]. The colors of products also evidently indicated the disappearance of big fragments after catalytic reaction, as seen in Fig. 7 ."
11,Conclusions,"In this work, a two-stage approach with non-noble metal catalysts was designed to produce the LOBFs from lignocellulose. After liquefaction, around 55 wt% of BC and approximately 1 wt% LSR could be obtained in CO/H2O/EtOH system under the optimum conditions. It was indicated that a low-LSR liquefaction of lignocellulose with acceptably high yield of bio-crude could be achieved under low temperature, as long as long reaction time served. It also suggested that water–gas shift reaction improved BC yield and suppressed LSR formation. However, self-formed catalytic substance would be more conducive to liquefaction of lignocellulose than CuZnAl. High-quality LOBF was produced by hydrogenation of BC in CuZnAl/MeOH system, with the aid of hydrogenation catalyst (Ni/HZSM-5) and associating solvent (n-C6H14). Notably, without coke formation, the overall yield of the LOBF reached 36.73 wt% with 7.80 wt% of oxygen content, while the HHV of the LOBF reached 40.92 MJ/kg. It was found that MeOH played a role as hydrogen donor for hydrogenation to directly decrease oxygen content and carbon source for alkylation to indirectly decrease oxygen content. Moreover, the n-C6H14 added to methanol contributed to deep deoxygenation of bio-crude, although it had no ability of supplying hydrogen. GC × GC-TOF-MS analysis indicated that the dominant products of the LOBF were hydrocarbons and polymethylphenols. MALDI-TOF-MS analysis indicated that no big fragments existed in the acquired LOBF in present study."
