0,Introduction,"The growing rate of energy consumption in recent years has led to the energy crisis in the world. Although the increasing consumption of fossil fuels has led to the rapid economic growth of various countries, the world is facing threatening changes due to the emission of pollutants from fossil fuel combustion and the increase in carbon dioxide emissions and its consequences. On the other hand, the finite supply of fossil fuels and the non-renewability of such resources have made researchers focus on the alteration of energy carriers and replacing them with clean fuels [1–5]. Moreover, the demand for building blocks such as light olefins is increasing worldwide [6]. One alternative is to produce energy carriers and olefins from biomass sources [7]. Biomass is the most abundant and least expensive source of carbon in nature. It is estimated that an annual amount of 110 billion tonnes of biomass are produced worldwide [6]. Therefore, biofuels and biochemicals derived either directly or indirectly from biomass can be considered as alternatives for the conventional fuels and chemicals produced from crude oil. Converting biomass to biofuels and chemicals has the advantages of sustainability and renewability that have attracted the attention of researchers [8,9]. Biofuels, which can be solid, liquid, or gas, have been widely utilized in transportation because they are clean, safe, environmentally friendly, and sustainable sources. Fjerbaek et al. [10] stated that biofuels can reduce the release of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and sulfur. The possibility to convert biomass to valuable products such as fuels and olefins makes it a potential alternative to fossil fuels. Biomass is, on the other hand, a promising candidate for diminishing the harmful effects of fossil sources exploitation. Converting bio-alcohols, which are produced from biomass sources, is currently a major trend. Dimethyl ether (DME) and diethyl ether (DEE) are suitable fuels, which can be produced from bio-alcohols [11–16]. DME and DEE can be utilized instead of diesel fuel and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) [17–19]. Given their excellent combustion quality, higher cetane number compared to diesel fuel, and low greenhouse gas emissions (due to smaller carbon chain), DME and DEE are utilized either solely or in combination with diesel fuels [20–27]. DME is gaseous and colorless at ambient temperature [28,29]. Catizzone et al. [30] demonstrated that DME can be utilized as an appropriate hydrogen carrier in the fuel cells and as an intermediate for the direct or indirect production of chemicals such as dimethyl sulfate, methyl acetate, and lower olefins. Given its outstanding characteristics and high potential, DME has been able to grab a share of the global energy market as a clean fuel and has received attention from academic and industrial sections [31–33]. DEE offers a variety of desired properties such as high cetane number (approximately 125), reasonable energy density, low autoignition temperature, and high volatility [34–36]. Krishnamoorthi et al. [37] used DEE as an additive to improve engine performance, diminishing emissions and the cold starting problem, and also as a solvent substitute for aromatic solvents. One of the advantages of DEE over DME is its liquid state in ambient conditions. Moreover, it can be effectively blended with diesel and biodiesel fuels [37,38]. Ethylene (also known as ethene) is one of the most important base materials in the petrochemical industry and is utilized as a food ripening, welding gas, production of mustard gas, anti-freeze agents, detergents, and also as an intermediate for producing valuable chemicals such as ethylene oxide and polymers such as polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) [39–41]. There are different methods to produce DME and DEE, including the dehydration of bio-alcohols, i.e. bio-methanol and bio-ethanol, respectively. The dehydration process is generally limited to the preparation of symmetrical ethers. Dehydration of alcohols results in the formation of symmetric ethers, the major of which include DME and DEE [28,29,34,36]. Methanol (CH3OH, MeOH) is a primary alcohol with strong bonds of C-H and O-H, giving a distinct role to this chemical. This alcohol is a colorless and clear liquid. MeOH production from natural gas and coal is an evolving technology [42,43]. The produced MeOH from wood and biomass sources is called bio-MeOH, which is a renewable source of fuel and chemical production [44,45]. Arteaga-Pérez et al. [46] produced MeOH from biomass studying different raw materials to this end. As demonstrated by the review of Dalena et al. [47] and Gautam et al. [48], bio-MeOH conversion to energy carriers and value-added chemicals is currently of great interest. Basile et al. [49] discussed ethanol (C2H5OH, EtOH) production, which can come from both chemical methods (such as direct or indirect hydration of ethylene) and bio-based routes (the fermentation of various raw materials) [50]. EtOH produced through the second method is called bio-EtOH. Sugar- and starch-containing materials are the main biomass sources for bio-EtOH production. The environmental advantages of EtOH compared to other materials include reduced CO x , SO X , and NO X emissions, safety, and high-octane number. Given the benefits of EtOH, researchers have conducted more studies on producing EtOH from biomass and examined different raw materials to produce this valuable product. A number of researchers focused on the production of energy carriers and value-added chemicals from bio-EtOH is currently a great deal of attention [51–59]. Bio-MeOH and bio-EtOH are potential sources for the production of the aforementioned clean energy carriers (i.e. DME and DEE) [60–62]. Moreover, the production of light olefins such as ethylene and butylene from bio-EtOH is currently a major trend [63–70]. Even though these processes have been proposed in the literature, there is still room for improvement. The main avenues to achieving this goal are based on the utilization of intensified processes for MeOH and EtOH dehydration. Bio-MeOH and bio-EtOH often include considerable quantities of water. Hence, the recuperative reactors for simultaneous dehydration and water separation are currently state of the art."
1,MeOH dehydration,"1.1 MeOH dehydration Large-scale production of DME through MeOH dehydration is a well-known process [71,72], but DME may be also produced from synthesis gas [73–76]. However, MeOH dehydration is an efficient route. Tokay et al. [16], Raoof et al. [29], and Bercic et al. [77] demonstrated that DME is produced during the catalytic dehydration of MeOH over the acidic solids such as γ-alumina. Having distinctive properties such as high activity and selectivity, low cost, availability, and high thermal/chemical stability, γ-alumina is known as the main acid catalyst in this process [78,79]. MeOH dehydration and its conversion to DME is an exothermic process and is usually performed in the temperature range of 250–400 °C and pressure up to 70 bar according to the following stoichiometry [16]. (1) 2 CH 3 OH ⇄ CH 3 OCH 3 + H 2 O"
2,EtOH dehydration,"1.2 EtOH dehydration EtOH dehydration is an endothermic process and, carrying out the reaction over alumina catalysts, the reaction products include DEE, ethylene, butylene, water, and very small quantities of acetaldehyde and hydrogen. (2) C 2 H 5 OH → k 1 C 2 H 4 + H 2 O (3) 2 C 2 H 5 OH → k 2 ( C 2 H 5 ) 2 O + H 2 O (4) ( C 2 H 5 ) 2 O → k 3 2 C 2 H 4 + H 2 O (5) C 2 H 5 OH → k 4 C 2 H 4 O + H 2 (6) 2 C 2 H 4 → k 5 C 4 H 8 In Equations (2) and (3), EtOH is dehydrated to ethylene and DEE. Then, DEE is converted to ethylene and water (Equation (4)). EtOH dehydrogenation (Equation (5)) may generate small quantities of acetaldehyde and hydrogen. According to reaction (6), ethylene is converted to butylene through the dimerization reaction. As discussed earlier, bio-alcohols may contain considerable quantities of water. Moreover, large quantities of water are produced through dehydration reactions. Hence, employing a membrane-assisted process can enhance the performance of the reactor in terms of conversion and product purity. This would be managed through in-situ water separation from the reaction media."
3,Membrane reactor,"1.3 Membrane reactor In recent decades, Process Intensification (PI) has been applied to exploit new developments in reactive separations technology combining reaction and separation to shift the chemical reaction equilibrium to the side of the reaction product. Reactive distillation represents one of the highly promising routes for producing ethanol under the principles of PI [80]. Nevertheless, as also pointed out by Cárdenas-Guerra et al. [81], the design and operational issues related to the reactive distillation result to be more complex than those shown by the conventional chemical reactors and conventional (nonreactive) distillation columns because of the nonlinear behavior related to the vapor-liquid equilibrium, vapor-liquid mass transfer, intra-catalyst diffusion (for heterogeneously catalyzed processes) and chemical kinetics. Consequently, membrane technology has become a viable alternative to distillation and absorption operations. Unlike conventional separation methods such as distillation, membrane separation does not require a mixture phase change. Hence, lower energy consumption would be managed. As described by Rahimpour et al. [82,83], the main characteristics of the membranes include the high surface area to volume ratio, high selectivity, high permeability, penetration rate control, and simultaneous reaction and separation. With the growth of membrane technology in the last decades and according to the PI strategy, the concept of combining reactions with in-situ membrane separation processes has aroused a great deal of attention due to the improved efficiency and increasing process economy [84,85]. Several membranologysts such as Iulianelli and co-workers [86,87], Rahimpour et al. [88], Iaquaniello et al. [89], De Falco et al. [90], and Kaptjein and coworkers [91,92] proposed the membrane reactors as an advantageous alternative to the conventional reactors, highlighting the most significant benefits such as: • Due to the high selective permeability of the membrane, high-purity products would be obtained. • In-situ separation of the products from the reaction media can help overcome the limitations in the thermodynamic equilibrium of reactions, which improves reaction efficiency. • The ability to shift the thermodynamic equilibrium utilizing the membrane can increase the conversion at the same temperature or decrease the temperature at the same conversion level. Integrating the separation and reaction processes can significantly reduce equipment costs and energy consumption. Moreover, an in-situ product removal from the reaction media for permeation through a membrane may be responsible for the chemical equilibrium shift toward the larger conversions and product yields. Furthermore, in-situ cooling/heating of the reaction zone can modify the thermal behavior and thus adjust the selectivity of the system. Therefore, this work based on the membrane-assisted dehydration of bio-alcohols results to constitute an unprecedented way to produce ethers and olefins."
4,Objective,"1.4 Objective In advance of developing sustainable and renewable routes for chemicals and energy manufacturing, conducting feasibility studies are beneficial to determine the impact of the operating conditions and then to find the optimum system performance. In this regard, the present contribution aims to conduct a feasibility study of bio-alcohols dehydration by utilizing an enhanced membrane-assisted reactor. The dehydration reaction occurs in a catalytic bed, while the water content of the as-produced bio-alcohol, as well as the produced water through the dehydration reaction, is eliminated in-situ. This would be achieved by employing a membrane that surrounds the catalytic bed. C1-C2 primary alcohols, as the major components of bio-alcohols, are considered. Hence, a mathematical formulation, that is made up of material, heat, and momentum balances, kinetic rate expressions, equation of state, and properties equations, is employed. The set of derived non-linear differential equations is then solved, numerically. Further sensitivity analysis determines the impact of operating conditions. An optimization procedure is then utilized to find the optimum working conditions as well as the best performance of the system in each case. As far as the authors know, this is the first study dedicated to simulation, sensitivity analysis, and optimization of a single process that is applicable for the simultaneous dehydration and purification of both bio-MeOH and bio-EtOH."
5,System description,"The reactor includes a fixed bed and the surrounding perm-selective membrane. Fig. 1 depicts the schematic of the reactor. Bio-alcohol is dehydrated in the reaction zone (tube side) and the innate water and the produced water through the reaction permeate into the membrane side (shell side) by the surrounding water-selective membrane. The dehydration reactions occur on the alumina catalyst particles that are loaded in the reaction zone. Low-pressure pure nitrogen is injected into the membrane side of the reactor as the sweep gas and sweeps out the permeated water. The hydroxy sodalite (H-SOD) membrane, which is highly water selective [92–94], is located between the shell and the tube sides. The characteristics of the reactor and catalyst particles are reported in Table 1 . The membrane-assisted bio-MeOH and bio-EtOH dehydration reactors are then denoted M-BMDR and M-BEDR, respectively."
6,Model description,
7,Assumptions,"3.1 Assumptions The following assumptions are considered to derive a mathematical model and evaluate the performance of the enhanced M-BMDR and M-BEDR. • Steady-state condition is applied in both reaction and membrane zones. • The radial gradient is ignored in both reaction and membrane zones. However, the water concentration and the temperature differences between the two sides result in water permeation and heat transfer from the reaction side toward the permeate side. • High gas velocity makes the dispersion effects negligible. • Porosity is constant in the reaction zone. • Non-ideal reacting mixtures are considered. • There is no lateral heat loss in the system (adiabatic operation). • Homogeneous reactions are considered (i.e. gas-phase reactions). • The Ergun equation is considered for the pressure drop in the reaction zone. • There is no pressure drop in the membrane side. • The H-SOD membrane is only water permeable."
8,Governing equations,"3.2 Governing equations To investigate the effect of various variables on the bio-alcohol dehydration process and also to determine the optimal operating conditions, the M-BMDR and M-BEDR systems are modeled by utilizing a mathematical model including the conservation of mass, energy, and momentum in both reaction and membrane zones. The derived governing equations are summarized in Table 2 . The mathematical model includes a set of first-order ordinary differential equations (ODE). The boundary conditions include the input component flowrates, temperature, and pressure at the reactor inlet. The base-case operating conditions of the bio-MeOH and bio-EtOH dehydration reactions are tabulated in Table 3 . The auxiliary equations employed to calculate the heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and viscosity of the components, as well as the reacting mixture, are presented in Tables 4–6 ."
9,H-SOD water-permeative membrane,"3.3 H-SOD water-permeative membrane Zeolite-based H-SOD membrane is a water-selective membrane with thermal and mechanical stability at high temperatures and pressures. H-SOD membranes are utilized to isolate small molecules such as water with a kinetic diameter of 2.68 A°. Full water perm-selectivity through the membrane was an ideal assumption in this work to set the maximum performance achievable by using zeolite-based H-SOD membranes, but in reality, great progress on membrane development was done to manufacture very high water perm-selective zeolite membranes [101,102]. For instance, Rohde et al. [101] stated that the H-SOD membrane offers 100% selectivity to water molecules. The water flux passing through the H-SOD membrane, which is a function of the pressure difference between the reaction and membrane zones, is expressed according to Equation (17) [88,91]. (17) J H 2 O = Q H 2 O A s V r ( P H 2 O − P H 2 O , m ) In Equation (17), A s is the surface area, Q H 2 O is the water permeability, V r is the reactor volume, and P H 2 O and P H 2 O , m are the partial pressure of water in the reaction and membrane sides, respectively."
10,Kinetics of bio-MeOH dehydration,"3.4 Kinetics of bio-MeOH dehydration The kinetic reaction rates of the MeOH dehydration in the presence of the γ-alumina catalyst have been extensively studied [77,103,104]. The kinetic rate equation, which was developed by Bai et al. [105], is employed for the MeOH dehydration reaction (Equation (18)). The rate and equilibrium constants are calculated by Equations (19) and (20), respectively [105,106]. Previous studies have exploited these equations [74,107,108]. (18) r M e O H = k f M e O H 2 ( 1 − f D M E f H 2 O K e q f M e O H 2 ) (19) k = 1457.024 exp ( − 78072.55 R T ) (20) ln K e q = − 26.64 + 3.707 ln T + 4019 T − 2.783 × 10 − 3 T + 3.8 × 10 − 7 T 2 + 6.561 × 10 4 T 3"
11,Bio-EtOH dehydration,3.5 Bio-EtOH dehydration The kinetic model of Kagyrmanova et al. [109] is employed for the EtOH dehydration over alumina-based catalysts. The rate equations for the main reactions (2)–(6) are presented in Equations 21–25. The kinetic parameters are reported in Table 7 . Ethylene (c2) formation from EtOH: (21) r c 2 = k 1 f E t O H DEE formation from EtOH: (22) r D E E = k 2 f E t O H 2 Ethylene (c2) formation from DEE: (23) r c 2 = k 3 f D E E Acetaldehyde (AA) formation from EtOH: (24) r A A = k 4 f E t O H Butylene (c4) formation from ethylene (c2): (25) r c 4 = k 5 f c 2 2 It is worth noting that the Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR EoS) was utilized to calculate the fugacity of each component (Table 8 ).
12,Numerical solution,3.6 Numerical solution A backward scheme of finite difference method is utilized to convert the set of ODE equations to nonlinear algebraic equations. MATLAB® is utilized for the relevant computer code [112]. The reactor length is divided into 200 separated sections to assure negligible numerical error.
13,Multi-objective optimization,"3.7 Multi-objective optimization The main goal of optimization methodology is to determine the best performance of the system and, meanwhile, one of the main objectives of the present contribution is the multi-objective optimization of the M-BMDR and M-BEDR. Therefore, a multi-objective optimization strategy is defined by employing an evolutionary algorithm via MATLAB®. The optimization strategy aims to simultaneously maximize the bio-alcohol conversion and the production yield of the desired compounds. The objective functions utilized in this study are defined as Equations 37–39. It is worth noting that, in the case of M-BMDR, the combination of MeOH conversion and DME yield is considered as the objective function, while in the optimization of M-BEDR, two distinct cases are pursued. Case 1 includes the maximization of EtOH conversion and DEE yield, while in case 2, EtOH conversion and ethylene yield are maximized. This would provide process flexibility for the production of different commodities.

14,Results and discussion,"The results of the numerical simulation, model validation, sensitivity analysis, and optimizations are discussed in this section. To do so, four distinct sections are presented including model validation, the sensitivity analysis and optimization of M-BMDR, the sensitivity analysis and optimization of M-BEDR, and the comparison of M-BMDR and M-BEDR. The performances of BMDR and M-BEDR in their optimized conditions are then discussed. Their capabilities in the production of ethers are then addressed and compared."
15,Model validation,"4.1 Model validation As far as the authors know, the experimental data of such a configuration is not available in the open literature. Therefore, the proposed mathematical formulation and solution are validated using real plant data of a conventional reactor. To do so, the results of an adiabatic MeOH dehydration reactor [107,108] were collected and compared against the results of the mathematical model. The input feed stream (1558.28 mol/s) of the industrial reactor (4 m in diameter and 8 m in length) includes 93 mol.% MeOH, 6 mol.% DME, and 1 mol.% water at 533 K and 18.2 bar total pressure. The reactor is loaded with γ-Al2O3 catalyst particles (ρC = 2010 kg/m3, 50% bed void fraction). The results are compared in Table 9 . The performance of the model is compared in terms of relative errors, from which good agreements between the model predictions and the real plant data are deduced. It is also worth of noting the quantitative real plant data of EtOH dehydration was not found in the open literature data to validate the model against these data too."
16,Simulation of M-BMDR,"4.2 Simulation of M-BMDR The performance of M-BMDR is addressed in this section. In this regard, the impacts of operating variables including feed flowrate, feed temperature, bio-MeOH composition, feed pressure, sweep gas flowrate, and sweep gas temperature on the axial profiles of temperature, pressure, MeOH conversion, and the components distributions are investigated. The base-case operating conditions are summarized in Table 3. 4.2.1 Effect of feed flowrate Figs. 2 and 3 and Fig. S1 of Supporting Information depict the effect of feed flowrate on the performance of M-BMDR. These results were obtained at 533 K and 18.2 bar feed temperature and pressure, respectively. The feed flowrates vary in the range of 44.9–67.3 kmol/h. The input feed stream includes 93 mol.% MeOH, 6 mol.% DME, and 1 mol.% water. The sweep gas stream includes 72 kmol/h nitrogen at 413 K and 0.05 bar. Fig. 2(a)–(b) depict the thermal behavior of the reaction and membrane sides, respectively. As per Fig. 2(a), a sudden temperature rise is observed in the upper section (reactor entrance) of the reaction side. This is observed in the whole injected feed flowrates. Such a temperature increase is due to the innate exothermic nature of the MeOH dehydration reaction. The cleavage of the chemical bond results in heat release and thus increasing the temperature of the reacting mixture. Then, heat and water exchange with the membrane side leads to a change in the temperature pattern. At the maximum temperature, the rate of heat elimination from the reaction side due to the convective heat transfer and water permeation into the membrane sides overcomes the rate of heat generation due to exothermic reaction. Two different parallel mechanisms affect the temperature pattern of the sweep gas stream. Heat exchange with the rection side, which possesses higher temperature as well as the permeated water from the reaction side in terms of enthalpy, affects the temperature pattern of the membrane side. This would result in the temperature rise in the sweep gas, i.e. the membrane side of the reactor (Fig. 2(b)). After the maximum point, a gradual temperature decrease in the middle section of the reaction side is observed, which is then followed by an almost constant pattern in the lower section (reactor outlet). In the lower section of the reaction side, the chemical equilibrium and a balance of heat effects are managed, which would result in the smooth temperature profiles in this section of the reactor in both reaction and membrane sides. Increasing the feed flowrate results in a minor change in the maximum temperature and shifting the maximum temperature. Increasing feed flowrate, on the on hand, results in the injection of larger quantities of the reactant (MeOH) into the reaction side, which increases the released reaction heat. Varying feed flowrate in the range of 44.9–67.3 kmol/h results in 562.7–583.8 K and 543.6–561.6 K output temperature of the reacting mixture and sweep gas streams, respectively. Fig. 2(c) depicts the axial pressure profiles in the reaction side of the reactor. Minor pressure drops occur inside the reaction side. However, increasing feed flowrate results in larger pressure drops. Changing the feed flowrate in the range of 44.9–67.3 kmol/h results in a 0.45–1.15 bar (2.5–6.3%) pressure drop along the reactor length. The axial profiles of MeOH flowrate and conversion, DME flowrate and molar fraction, water molar fraction in the reaction side, and DME yield are depicted in Fig. 3. Moreover, the effect of feed flowrate on the water flowrates in both reaction and membrane sides, as well as the molar fractions of water in the membrane side and MeOH molar fraction in the reaction side, are depicted in Fig. S1 of Supporting Information. MeOH flowrate decreases along the reactor length, while MeOH conversion increases. This is owing to MeOH consumption through the dehydration reaction. As depicted in Fig. 3(a)–(b), increasing feed flowrate does not change the final MeOH conversion, significantly. The minor increase is managed in the lower feed flowrate. However, the results reveal that the enhanced membrane-assisted system is capable of converting large quantities of bio-MeOH. Changing feed flowrate in the range of 44.9–67.3 kmol/h results in 95.7–92.3% MeOH conversion. However, the feed flowrate strongly affects the product distribution. As per Fig. 3(c)-3(d), increasing feed flowrate increases the molar flowrate of DME, while DME molar fraction reduces. When larger quantities of bio-MeOH are injected into the system, larger water content exists in the reaction side (Fig. 3(e) and Fig. S1(a)). This would reduce the concentration of DME in the reaction side (Fig. 3(d)). As per Fig. 3(e) and Figs. S1(a) and a sharp increase in water content is observed in the reactor entrance due to dehydration reaction. After reaching the maximum point, gradual decreases are observed. At the maximum point, the rate of water permeation overcomes that of generation by the reaction, after which the rate of permeation is dominant. Accordingly, simultaneous bio-MeOH dehydration and water separation occur by employing the enhanced membrane-assisted reactor. The results of Fig. 3(f) reveals that DME yield does not alter significantly when feeding flowrate changes. As a whole, increasing feed flowrate leads to larger than 50% DME yield (52.6–54.3%) and the product streams including 73.3–86.8% of DME. The largest DME concentration (86.8%) is obtained in the case of the smallest bio-MeOH feed injection feed flowrate (44.9 kmol/h). It is worth noting that large quantities of water are permeated into the membrane side (up to 179 kmol/h and 71% in the membrane side, Figures Fig. S1(b) and Fig. S1(c)). The captured water vapor in the membrane side can be then condensed and utilized in the utilities. 4.2.2 Effect of feed temperature Figs. 4 and 5 address the effect of feed temperature (507–559 K) on the performance of M-BMDR. The results of 15.5828 kmol/h feed stream including 93 mol.% MeOH, 6 mol.% DME, and 1 mol.% water at 18.18 bar is addressed. The sweep gas stream includes 72 kmol/h nitrogen at 413 K and 0.05 bar. The results of water flowrates in the reaction and membrane sides, as well as the molar fractions of water and MeOH, are also presented in Fig. S2 of Supporting Information. The axial temperature variation along the reactor length in the reaction and membrane sides are demonstrated in Fig. 4(a)–(b), respectively. The input temperature of the sweep gas, i.e. membrane side is considered lower than those of the reaction side. Based on the fact that the MeOH dehydration reaction is highly exothermic, the surrounding membrane side acts as a coolant to shift the chemical equilibria of the reacting system and enhance the equilibrium conversion. As depicted in Fig. 4(a), the innate exothermic nature of the MeOH dehydration reaction results in sharp temperature increases at the reactor entrance and the further maximum points. However, decreasing input temperature shifts the maximum point into the middle section of the reactor. Although temperature decrease might enhance the equilibrium conversion, it reduces the rate of the reaction. Hence, the kinetic and equilibrium effects of temperature alteration compete in this case. The results reveal that a 52.0 K increase in the feed temperature results in a 26.5 K temperature increase of the output products. The constant temperature of the coolant (i.e. sweep gas stream) is, on the one hand, the reason for the temperature convergence at the reactor outlet. In fact, at the upper section of the reactor (i.e. reactor entrance), the heat effects include the heat generation of the exothermic dehydration reaction as well as the heat exchange with the cold membrane side. Once the chemical equilibrium is reached in the middle section of the reactor, heat generation does not occur. Hence, at the lower section of the reactor (i.e. reactor outlet), heat transport to the cold membrane side is the only heat effect, which results in temperature reduction. Such a conclusion can be deduced from the temperature profiles of the membrane side in Fig. 4(b). By increasing feed temperature, the output temperature of the sweep gas increases significantly, which is in fact due to the larger temperature difference between the reaction and membrane sides. The results of axial pressure profiles in the reaction side, which are depicted in Fig. 4(c), reveal the feed temperature does not affect pressure drop along the reactor length. Fig. 5 illustrates the effect of feed temperature on product distributions. The axial profiles of MeOH flowrate, MeOH conversion, and DME flowrate are presented in Fig. 5(a)-5(c), respectively. Although initial consumption of MeOH enhances by increasing feed temperature, the final conversion does not change, significantly. However, more than 90% of MeOH conversion is obtained in whole cases (Fig. 5(a)–(b)). DME flowrate in the reactor inlet enhances by increasing feed temperature. However, the production capacity does not alter (Fig. 5(c)–(f)). The interesting point is the enhancement of DME concentration with increasing feed temperature. This would be owing to enhanced water permeation into the membrane side as a result of temperature increase. Fig. 5(d)–(e), as well as Fig. S2(a)-S2(c) of the Supporting Information prove such a conclusion. Alteration of feed temperature (507–559 K) results in the final products with 74.8–80.6% mol.% DME. The output DME yield of 53% confirms the enhanced efficiency of the M-BMDR. 4.2.3 Effect of feed composition As mentioned earlier, bio-alcohol is often made up of an alcoholic compound (such as MeOH) and water. Forasmuch as the major benefit of the proposed system is the simultaneous reaction and water separation, the water content is an effective factor. Hence, the impact of water content, i.e. feed composition is discussed in this section. The effect of concentration of bio-MeOH (molar fraction, y a ) on the reactor performance is depicted in Figs. 6 and 7 and Fig. S3 of the Supporting Information. Bio-MeOH feeds that are composed of 20–93 mol.% MeOH (y a = 0.20–0.93) are investigated at a 56.1 kmol/h total feed flowrate, a feed temperature of 533 K, and 18.18 bar feed pressure. The sweep gas stream includes 72 kmol/h nitrogen at 413 K and 0.05 bar. Axial temperature and pressure profiles are depicted in Fig. 6. The thermal behavior (Fig. 6(a)–(b)) indicate that bio-MeOH feed composition strongly affects the reactor performance. A significant point deduced from these figures is the change in the reaction pattern initiation by the alteration of feed composition. In the high-concentration range (greater than 70 mol.% of MeOH), the temperature profile includes a maximum point followed by further gradual cooling (Fig. 6(a)). This is in fact due to the more heat release through the conversion of the larger quantities of the alcoholic compound. The location of the maximum temperature is shifted to the reactor outlet while the MeOH concentration of the feed stream increases in this range. The reason for such a trend is well discussed in the previous sections. In the low-concentration range (below 70 mol.% of MeOH), the temperature profiles are different. In this range, small quantities of reaction heat are released. The lower MeOH concentration, on the other hand, controls the rate of dehydration reaction and thus restricts the released heat. Hence, the dominant heat effect in the low-concentration range is heat exchange with the coolant, i.e. membrane side. However, water elimination from the reaction side and increasing MeOH at the lower section of the reactor results in a minor dehydration reaction. Changing the mechanism in the thermal behavior of the system with feed composition is also indicated from the temperature profiles of the membrane side (Fig. 6(b)). However, the higher temperature of the reaction side and heat exchange with the membrane side leads to a temperature increase in the whole concentration range. The minor change of pressure drop with the bio-MeOH concentration is observed in Fig. 6(c). 0.22–0.76 bar (1.2–4.1%) pressure drop occurs while feed molar concentration changes (20–93 mol.%). To determine the impact feed composition on the reaction efficiency and the productivity of the reactor, Fig. 7 and Fig. S3 of the Supporting Information are provided. As per Fig. 7(a)–(b), MeOH concentration in the bio-alcohol feed stream affects the reaction mechanism, strongly. This is in accordance with the thermal behavior of the system (Figure (6)). In the high-concentration range (greater than 70 mol.% of MeOH), the trends of MeOH flowrate and conversion are similar to those addressed in the previous sections (Fig. 7(a)–(b)). Sharp initial increases followed by gradual changes in the MeOH consumption are observed in this range. Hence, the trends of DME generation profiles are also similar to the previous observations (Fig. 7(c), (d), and 7(f)). Water distribution profiles (Fig. 7(e) and Fig. S3 of the Supporting Information) also confirm such a statement. In the lower concentrations (smaller than 70 mol.% of MeOH), the mechanism is altered. Fig. 7(e) demonstrates that when larger water quantities are injected with the bio-MeOH feed stream (i.e. low-quality bio-MeOH), the dominant mechanism through the length of the membrane reactor is water separation. This is in fact due to the larger driving force of water permeation (Equation (17)). Larger water quantities are permeated into the membrane side when the low-quality bio-MeOH feeds are injected (Fig. S3(a)-S3(c)). Fig. 7(d) indicates that a product with a larger concentration of DME is produced when larger quantities of MeOH exist in the feed stream, while the larger DME yield is managed in the case of smaller quantities of MeOH (Fig. 7(f)). The larger DME concentration (80 mol.%) in the products is achieved in the case of a feed stream with 93 mol.% MeOH, while the largest DME yield (59%) is obtained when a low-quality bio-MeOH feed stream with 20 mol.% MeOH is injected. High-purity DME products would then eliminate or at least reduce the size of the downstream purification facilities. Hence, the interesting feature of the enhanced M-BMDR is the capability of converting bio-MeOH feeds in a wide range of concentrations with a large DME production capacity. 4.2.4 Effects of feed pressure and sweep gas Feed pressure has a minor impact on the thermal behavior of the system as well as the conversion. However, it has a considerable impact on the purity of the non-permeated compound. Figs. S4–S6 of the Supporting Information prove such a statement. More details could be found in the Supporting Information file. The impact of sweep gas condition on the reactor performance is depicted in Figs. S7–S12 of the Supporting Information. The sweep gas flowrate and temperature have minor effects on the conversion, product distribution, and pressure drop. 4.2.5 Optimized M-BMDR The results of sensitivity analysis in the previous section demonstrate that the operating conditions have a great impact on the thermal behavior of the system, pressure drop, product distributions, and the productivity of M-BMDR. To find the best performance of the system in the evaluated conditions, an optimization procedure was developed. The results of the system in the optimum condition is compared with the base case in this section. The comparison is made based on reaction-side temperature profile, MeOH conversion, and DME yield. The comparison is addressed in Fig. 8 . Moreover, the optimized operating conditions are summarized in Table 10 . As mentioned earlier, the main objective of the optimization procedure was maximizing MeOH conversion as well as DME yield. The temperature patterns of Fig. 8(a) indicate the different heat effects in the base case and the optimum one. This would be due to the different feed compositions and temperatures. The optimum feed composition includes 20 mol.% MeOH, 6 mol.% DME, and 74 mol.% water, while the feed stream in the base case includes 93 mol.% MeOH. The differences in heat effects in the high- and low-concentration range are extensively discussed in the previous sections (section 5.2.3.). The axial profiles of MeOH conversion in two cases are compared in Fig. 8(b). 99.0% and 93.9% MeOH conversions are managed when the M-BMDR reactor works in the base-case and optimized operating conditions, respectively. Moreover, based on the axial profiles of DME yield (Fig. 8(c)), applying the optimized condition results in a larger DME yield. The outputs of the reactor in two cases are compared quantitatively in Fig. 8(d). The results reveal that the enhanced M-BMDR reactor is capable of converting low-quality bio-MeOH feeds."
17,Simulation of M-BEDR,"4.3 Simulation of M-BEDR This section addresses the performance of M-BEDR. In this regard, the impacts of reactor inputs including feed flowrate, feed temperature, bio-EtOH composition, feed pressure, sweep gas flowrate, and sweep gas temperature on the profiles of temperature, pressure, EtOH conversion, and the components distributions along the reactor length are investigated. The base-case operating conditions are summarized in Table 3. It is worth noting that very small quantities of AA and hydrogen are produced through the dehydration of EtOH. Hence, the production of these compounds is not discussed. 4.3.1 Effect of feed flowrate Figs. 9 and 10 , as well as Figs. S11 and S12 of the Supporting Information, address the effect of bio-EtOH feed flowrate on the performance of M-BEDR. The effect of bio-EtOH feed (96 mol.% EtOH and 4 mol.% water) flowrate was investigated at 700 K and 1.5 bar feed temperature and pressure, respectively. The feed flowrates vary in the range of 4.49–6.73 kmol/h. The sweep gas stream includes 72 kmol/h nitrogen at 690 K and 0.05 bar. The dehydration of EtOH includes a set of reactions, the consequence of which is endothermic (Equations (2)–(6)). Fig. 9(a)–(b) demonstrate the thermal behavior of the reaction and membrane sides, respectively. A sharp temperature decrease in the reactor entrance is observed in Fig. 9(a). This proves that the consequence of the reaction, which EtOH incorporates, is highly endothermic. In the reactor entrance, the reacting mixture mainly consists of EtOH. Hence, the conversion of EtOH in the upper section of the reactor results in a sharp temperature decrease. Heat exchange with the membrane side leads to a constant temperature in the middle section of the reactor, which is followed by a minor temperature increase at the reactor outlet. An exothermic reaction, i.e. the conversion of ethylene to butylene is dominant in this region, which is the main reason for such a temperature increase in the lower feed flowrates (4.49–5.05 kmol/h). The alteration of feed flowrate affects the temperature profile at the reactor outlet. This would be due to a change in the reaction mechanism in this region. The change in reaction mechanism is well discussed in the results of product distributions. Up to 50 K temperature decrease in the membrane side is, on the one hand, due to heat exchange with the reaction side. However, the alteration of feed flowrate does not affect the temperature profiles of sweep gas (Fig. 9(b)). The results of pressure profiles, which are addressed in Fig. 9(c) depict that increasing feed flowrate increases the pressure drop along the reactor length. Hence, injecting 4.49–6.73 kmol/h bio-EtOH feed results in a 0.13–0.29 bar (8.7–19.5%) pressure drops. EtOH dehydration reaction may produce a variety of value-added products, the major of which includes DEE, ethylene, and butylene. Accordingly, the alteration of operating conditions may change the production capacity, as well as product distributions. Fig. 10, as well as Figs. S13 and S14 of the Supporting Information, addresses the EtOH and components distributions. Fig. 10(a)–(b) illustrate that the enhanced M-BEDR is capable of converting almost all the input EtOH in the evaluated range of feed flowrate. However, the alteration of feed flowrate strongly affects the production rate of the desired products, i.e. DEE and ethylene. As per Fig. 10(c)–(d), larger quantities of DEE are produced when the feed flowrate increases. Up to 35% DEE yield is obtained in the upper section of the reactor as a result of the immediate dehydration of EtOH (Equation (3)). A portion of the generated DEE and the input EtOH is then dehydrated to produce ethylene. Accordingly, the production rate of DEE reduces in the middle section of the reactor, while the production rate of ethylene enhances (Fig. 10(e)–(f)). Fig. S13 of the Supporting Information depicts the water profiles in both reaction and membrane sides. A sharp increase in the water content at the reactor inlet is observed due to the immediate dehydration reactions (Equations (2)–(4)). Then, water is permeated into the membrane side leading to the reduction of water content in the reaction sides and increasing water content in the membrane side. Increasing ethylene content in the reaction side due to the consumption of EtOH and DEE, as well as the removal of water, results in the enhancement of the dimerization reaction, i.e. the conversion of ethylene to butylene (Equation (6)) in the lower section of the reactor (Fig. S14(a)-S14(c)). This reaction is highly exothermic leading to a temperature increase in the lower section of the reactor (Fig. 9(a)). Increasing feed flowrate, which is equivalent to EtOH increasing in the reaction media, enhances the formation and yield of DEE (Equation (3), Fig. 10(c)–(d), and Fig. S14(e) of the Supporting Information). Increasing the concentrations of EtOH and DEE as a result of increasing feed flowrate enhances the formation of ethylene (Equation (2) and (4), Fig. 10(e)). However, the yield of ethylene decreases (Fig. 10(f)). This is due to the fact that when a 50% increase in feed flowrate is applied (4.49–6.73 kmol/h), an approximately 20% enhancement in the ethylene output flowrate (3.03–3.64 kmol/h) is obtained. Hence, the yield of ethylene decreases with increasing feed flowrate. Moreover, the purity of ethylene in the final product decrease with increasing feed flowrate (Fig. S14(f) of the Supporting Information). This would be due to the stronger impact of EtOH concentration on the reaction rate of DEE formation (Equation (22)). As a result of a 50% increase in the feed flowrate (4.49–6.73 kmol/h), more than 350% enhancement in the DEE output flowrate (0.26–1.18 kmol/h) is managed, while the output flowrate of ethylene is enhanced 20% (3.03–3.64 kmol/h). Therefore, ethylene molar fraction reduces with increasing feed flowrate. It is deduced that by increasing feed flowrate, the tendency of DEE formation becomes dominant over ethylene formation. A minor product of the bio-EtOH dehydration reaction is butylene, which is produced as a result of the ethylene dimerization reaction (Equation (6)). This reaction is exothermic. Smaller quantities of butylene are obtained when larger quantities of bio-EtOH are injected into the system (Fig. S14(a)- S14(c) of the Supporting Information). Owing to the larger pressure drop and the reduction of ethylene molar fraction as a result of larger quantities of feed, the rate of ethylene dimerization reaction (Equation (25)) is dampened. Hence, smaller quantities of butylene are produced when larger bio-EtOH feed quantities are injected into the M-BEDR. This is in accordance with the temperature profiles of the reaction side (Fig. 9(a)). Accordingly, when a 4.49–6.74 kmol/h bio-EtOH feed (96 mol.% EtOH) is injected into the enhanced M-BEDR, 0.26–1.18 kmol/h DEE, 3.03–3.64 kmol/h ethylene, and 0.34–0.11 kmol/h butylene would be produced. The yields of DEE, ethylene, and butylene productions are in the ranges of 6.1–18.3%, 70.4–56.4%, 7.8–1.8%, respectively. By employing the water-permeative membrane and in-situ water separation, the output products including 5–15 mol.% DEE, 58-46 mol.% ethylene, and 6-2 mol.% butylene would be managed. It is also worth noting that the collected water in the membrane side enhances the productivity of the process. As per Fig. S13 of the Supporting Information, considerable quantities of water (up to 21.1 kmol/h) are collected in the membrane side, which can be then condensed, separated, and utilized in the upstream heating/cooling facilities. 4.3.2 Effect of feed temperature The effect of input temperature (666–734 K) on the performance of M-BEDR is addressed in Figs. 11 and 12 , as well as Figs. S15 and S16 of the Supporting Information. The input feed includes 5.61 kmol/h bio-EtOH (96 mol.% EtOH) at 1.5 bar. The input sweep gas stream includes 72 kmol/h nitrogen at 690 K and 0.05 bar. Fig. 11 illustrates the axial temperature and pressure profiles. The highly endothermic reaction is evident and considerable temperature reduction is observed in both reaction and membrane sides (Fig. 11(a)–(b)). The temperature profiles are almost the same when the feed temperature changes. Minor temperature rises in the lower section of the reactor are observed when the feeds with higher temperatures are injected. The temperature patterns and heat effects are well discussed in the previous section. The minor change in the temperature patterns at the reactor outlet is due to the change in the reaction mechanism and the exothermic dimerization reaction in this region. Up to 50 K temperature decrease in the membrane side is observed due to heat transfer into the reaction side. A minor temperature change is observed in the output sweep gas stream. The results of pressure profiles (Fig. 11(c)) demonstrate that increasing feed temperature leads to a minor increase in the pressure drop along the reactor length (0.19–0.22 bar, 12.4–14.5%). This change would be owing to the alteration of the physical properties of the reacting mixture (i.e. density and viscosity) with increasing temperature. Fig. 12, as well as Figs. S15 and S16 of the Supporting Information, address the axial profiles of the product flowrates, yields, and molar fractions. The trends and reaction mechanisms are well discussed in the previous sections. Fig. 12 depicts the EtOH consumption as well as the production of the main product, i.e. DEE and ethylene. EtOH is entirely consumed through the reactor length (Fig. 12(a)–(b)). Hence, the enhanced M-BEDR is capable of converting almost all the input EtOH in a wide temperature range. Increasing feed temperature enhances dehydration reactions. This is deduced from the water profiles in Fig. S15 of the Supporting Information. However, the distributions of major products are different. Increasing feed temperature reduces the formation of DEE, while it enhances the production of ethylene (Fig. 12(c)-12(f)). It reveals that the overall rate of the reactions that are responsible for ethylene production (Equation (2), (4), and (6)) increases with temperature. Larger ethylene content in the higher temperatures leads to the formation of larger quantities of butylene (Fig. S16(a)-S16(c) of the Supporting Information). The concentration of DEE reduces with increasing temperature, while the concentration of ethylene increases (Figs. S16(e) and S16(f) of the Supporting Information). Accordingly, when the feed temperature of the M-BEDR is adjusted in the range of 666–734 K, 0.97–0.49 kmol/h DEE, 3.06–3.72 kmol/h ethylene, and 0.11–0.27 kmol/h butylene would be generated. The yields of DEE, ethylene, and butylene generations are in the ranges of 18.1–9.2%, 56.8–69.1%, 2.1–5.0%, respectively. By an in-situ water elimination strategy, the output streams include 16-7 mol.% DEE, 49–54 mol.% ethylene, and 2–4 mol.% butylene. The collected water in the membrane side (up to 21.4 kmol/h) can be then condensed, separated, and employed in the upstream heating/cooling facilities, which would then enhance the productivity of the systems. 4.3.3 Effect of feed composition To elucidate the impact of bio-EtOH feed composition on the performance of the M-BEDR, Figs. 13 and 14 , as well as Figs. S17 and S18 of the Supporting Information, are presented. The input feed includes 5.61 kmol/h bio-EtOH at 700 K and 1.5 bar. The bio-EtOH mixtures that are composed of 20–96 mol.% EtOH (y a = 0.20–0.96) are investigated. A sweep gas stream including 72 kmol/h nitrogen at 690 K and 0.05 bar is employed. The feed concentration has a major impact on both thermal behavior and product distribution. The axial temperature profiles are illustrated in Fig. 13(a)–(b). In the higher concentration range (y a = 0.77–0.96), the temperature profiles are similar to those discussed in the previous sections, while reducing alcoholic content changes the reaction mechanism and temperature profiles, significantly. In the low-concentration range (y a = 0.2–0.58), a sudden temperature increase in the middle section of the reactor is observed. This would induce a temperature increase in the membrane side too. Changing the concentration increases the hot-point temperature and also shifts the location of this point. Such a change in the temperature profiles is due to the reaction mechanism shift, which will be explained in the upcoming discussions. The pressure profiles of Fig. 13(c) demonstrate that increasing bio-EtOH concentration in the feed stream leads to larger pressure drops along the reactor length. The alteration of the feed concentration changes the physical properties of the reacting mixture (i.e. density and viscosity), significantly and affects the pressure profile. Hence, a 0.07–0.20 bar (4.9–13.4%) pressure drop occurs while the concentration of the alcoholic compound changes (y a = 0.20–0.96). Fig. 14(a)–(b) reveal that the enhanced M-BEDR is capable of converting the entire injected bio-EtOH with the feed stream. The reaction mechanism is altered significantly when the feed concentration changes. In the whole concentration range, the dehydration reactions (Equations (2)–(5)) occur in the upper section of the reactor and thus DEE, ethylene, and water are formed (Fig. 14(c)-14(f) and Fig. S17 of the Supporting Information). When larger quantities of EtOH exist in the feed stream (y a = 0.77–0.96), further consumption of DEE results in the generation of ethylene and butylene. This endothermic reaction set imposes a sudden temperature decrease in the upper section of the reactor followed by the constant temperature up to the reactor outlet (Fig. 13). In the lower EtOH concentrations (y a = 0.20–0.58), after the consumption of EtOH entirely up to the middle section of the reactor (Fig. 14(a)–(b) and Fig. S18(d) of the Supporting Information), the minor generated DEE is also converted to ethylene. This results in the elimination of DEE and the formation of large quantities of ethylene with up to 85 mol.% concentration (Fig. 14(c)-14(f) and Figs. S18(e) and S18(f) of the Supporting Information). Owing to the large partial pressure of ethylene in the reaction mixture, the dimerization reaction (Equation (6)) becomes kinetically dominant. This leads to the fast consumption of ethylene and the formation of butylene (Fig. 14(e)–(f)). Since this reaction is highly exothermic, it imposes a sudden temperature increase in the system (Fig. 13(a)–(b)). After the total consumption of ethylene, the butylene flowrate, concentration, and yield become constant (Fig. S18(a)-S18(c) of the Supporting Information). Accordingly, large quantities of butylene with high concentration (up to 55 mol.%) would be produced when low-quality bio-EtOH feed is utilized. However, a very high concentration of the EtOH (larger than 58% in the feed stream) prevents the system from producing larger quantities of butylene. When the feed concentration of the M-BEDR is adjusted in the range of 20–96 mol.% EtOH, 0.00–0.74 kmol/h DEE, 0.01–3.41 kmol/h ethylene, and up to 1.61 kmol/h butylene would be produced. The yields of DEE, ethylene, and butylene productions are in the ranges of 0.0–13.8%, 0.7–63.3%, and 3.2–49.4%, respectively. By an in-situ water separation strategy, the output streams may include 0–11 mol.% DEE, 1–52 mol.% ethylene, and up to 56 mol.% butylene. No DEE and very small quantities of ethylene are produced in the lowest concentration of EtOH in the feed stream (y a = 0.20). Up to 41.6 kmol/h water would be collected on the membrane side. Reducing the concentration of the alcoholic compound in the bio-EtOH feed results in the injection of larger quantities of water into the system. To enhance the productivity of the system, the collected water in the membrane side can be then condensed, separated, and employed in the upstream heating/cooling units. 4.3.4 Effects of feed pressure and sweep gas Feed pressure barely affects the temperature profiles as well as the conversion. However, it has a major impact on productivity and product distribution. Figs. S19–S22 of the Supporting Information prove such a statement. More details could be found in the Supporting Information file. The impact of sweep gas condition on the reactor performance is depicted in Figs. S23–S30 of the Supporting Information. The sweep gas condition has minor impacts on the reaction side and a major impact on the membrane side. 4.3.5 Optimized M-BEDR Through the sensitivity analysis, it was demonstrated that the operating conditions affect the thermal behavior of the system, pressure drop, product distributions, and the productivity of M-BEDR, significantly. Optimization strategies were employed to find the best performance of the system in two different cases, i.e. maximizing either DEE yield or ethylene yield. The performance of the system in two optimized cases is compared against the base case in terms of thermal behavior, EtOH conversion, DEE yield, and ethylene yield. To do so Fig. 15 is depicted. The optimized operating conditions in the two cases are summarized in Table 11 . As previously mentioned, the main objective of the optimization procedure was maximizing EtOH conversion as well as the yield of the products. In the optimized case 1, EtOH conversion and DEE yield were considered as the objectives, while in the optimized case 2, EtOH conversion and ethylene yield were maximized. The temperature profiles of Fig. 15(a) indicate that the heat effects are similar in the three cases. However, a larger temperature increase in the reactor outlet is observed. This would be due to the dominant dimerization reaction, which is highly exothermic, in this condition. In the optimized case 2, larger quantities of ethylene enhance this reaction and thus increase the released heat. In the optimized case 2, the ethylene production and its further dimerization are controlled. Moreover, the input feed temperature is lower in this case. Hence the lower output temperature is obtained in this case. The optimum bio-EtOH feed compositions in two optimized cases are similar to the base case (96 mol.% MeOH and 4 mol.% water). However, the final EtOH conversions are different. In the base case and the optimized case 2, an approximately 98% EtOH conversion is managed, while in the optimized case 1, it is not far more than 94% (Fig. 15(a)). The axial profiles of DEE and ethylene yields are compared in Fig. 15(c) and (d). As per Fig. 15(c), the production of DEE enhances significantly in the optimized case 1 (29.07%), while ethylene production is controlled (35.17%) in this case. Employing the operating conditions of the optimized case 2 results in 3.38% and 75.79% DEE and ethylene yields, respectively. In the base case, 13.78% DEE and 63.31% ethylene yields were obtained. The results indicate that employing case-specific optimization improves the performance of M-BEDR, significantly. As a general comment related to the bio-ethanol purification step, which implies the interest of researchers aimed to reduce the energy demand in the optimization of the bio-EtOH purification process, two main challenges remain to be solved in this field. The first is represented by the composition of the feed, which is a diluted aqueous solution of EtOH coming from the fermentation step, whereas the second is represented by the presence of a minimum azeotrope between water and EtOH, which is responsible for the purity achievable in unit operations based on liquid-vapor equilibria. Extractive, heterogeneous, pressure-swing, and reactive distillations beside adsorption and membrane separation represent the current solutions adopted to circumvent the azeotropic concentration. In particular, membrane separation is not limited by the relative volatility, and thus it is claimed to be economically more convenient compared to distillation when azeotropic mixtures are considered [113]. Nevertheless, since membranes and reactive distillation result to be the most promising techniques to achieve savings in both energy and capital costs [114], in a future work the integration of membrane separation with reactive distillation will be explored as a hybrid system."
18,Comparison of M-BMDR and M-BEDR,"4.4 Comparison of M-BMDR and M-BEDR To provide an overview of the bio-alcohol feed shift strategy by employing the enhanced membrane-assisted dehydration reactor, a comparison between M-BMDR and M-BED in their base-case and optimized conditions is made in this section. Two systems, in their base-case operating conditions, are capable of converting large quantities of bio-alcohols. Moreover, both systems offer great productivity when low-to high-quality bio-alcoholic feeds are employed. The M-BMDR works in milder reaction temperature and higher reaction pressure when compared with M-BEDR. Comparing Fig. 8(d) with Fig. 15(e) and (f) reveals that more than 93% of the input alcoholic compounds are converted. It is worth noting that the capacity of the M-BMDR is 10 times larger than the M-BEDR. In their optimized operating conditions, both systems convert almost all the injected alcoholic compounds. Both systems offer great performance in terms of the production capacity of etheric compounds, i.e. DME or DEE. The M-BEDR is also capable of producing large quantities of olefinic compounds, i.e. ethylene and butylene is a case-specific operating condition. The optimized M-BMDR is capable of producing 79.5 mol of DME when 100 mol of MeOH are injected with the bio-alcoholic feed (500 kmol/h feed). The M-BEDR, in a DEE-specific optimized condition, produces 29.2 mol of DEE when 100 mol of EtOH are injected with the bio-alcoholic feed (104.2 kmol/h feed). In another case-specific operating condition, the M-BEDR is capable of producing 75.8 mol of ethylene per 100 mol of input EtOH (104.2 kmol/h feed)."
19,Conclusion,"To develop a reaction system for the conversion of bio-alcohols (mainly C1-C2 primary alcohols) to the value-added products in a wide range of operating conditions, a feasibility study of an enhanced membrane-assisted dehydration reactor was conducted in this work. The system is capable of in-situ elimination of the innate water of the bio-alcohols as well as the generated water in the dehydration reaction. This would enhance the conversion of the bio-alcohols and the quality of the final products. Moreover, compacted downstream purification units are required in this case. The separated water is also beneficial in the cooling/heating facilities. Bio-MeOH and bio-EtOH as the major bio-alcohol compounds were evaluated and, in this regard, a calculation procedure including the governing equations of mass, energy, and momentum conservations and auxiliary equations of the physical properties was developed. After the validation of the model against the real plant data of a large-scale MeOH dehydration reactor, a rigorous sensitivity analysis was developed. Conversion, desired product flowrates, production yield, and the purity of the desired compounds were considered as the criteria of system comparison. Then, the optimized operating conditions of each system were determined through an optimization procedure. As major advancements of the present contribution, the M-BMDR was capable of converting a large quantity of the injected bio-MeOH in a wide range of operating conditions. Furthermore, the water removal from the reaction zone for permeation through the membrane allowed the chemical equilibrium to be shifted towards the products, determining larger DME production capacities. The simulations revealed that, by decreasing feed flowrate, MeOH conversion, DME production, and DME purity were intensified. On the other hand, an increase in feed temperature had a minor impact on the final MeOH conversion and DME yield, even though the DME purity in the final product was enhanced. At a higher concentration of MeOH in the feed stream, the reaction mechanism, MeOH conversion, and product distribution were altered. Larger DME yields were obtained at lower MeOH feed concentrations, while higher purities were obtained with larger MeOH inputs. The feed pressure had a minor impact on the MeOH conversion, although it enhanced the purity of the final DME product due to the membrane-based water removal from the reaction zone. Comparing the M-BMDR in the base-case and optimized operating conditions revealed that both MeOH conversion and DME yield were maximized. The M-BEDR resulted able to convert almost all the injected bio-EtOH in an extended range of operating conditions. DEE yield enhanced with increasing feed flowrate and EtOH concentration in the feed, or reducing feed temperature feed pressure. On the other hand, the ethylene yield enhanced with increasing feed flowrate, feed temperature, EtOH concentration in the feed, and feed pressure. This work evidenced also that low-quality bio-EtOH feeds resulted in the formation of large quantities of butylene. Evaluating the M-BEDR in the base-case and two DEE- and ethylene-specific optimized operating conditions revealed that DEE and ethylene yields were maximized in their specific cases. Although the present feasibility study demonstrated considerable achievements in the conversion of bio-alcoholic compounds, further economic and environmental impact evaluations will be required to prove the efficiency of the system and how it may not constitute a risk for the ambient. Both the last tasks represent important aspects that need to be further studied in order to fully understand the real potential of the development of the membrane-based systems in BEDR. Furthermore, in the next work, the utilization of finite water perm-selective zeolite membranes will be analyzed in order to evaluate the effect of the permeation of other products from the reaction side on the membrane and catalytic performance, comparing the results with the data presented here as a reference study."
