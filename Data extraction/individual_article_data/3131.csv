0,Introduction,"Polymeric foams have attracted wide interests ranging from industry to academic research due to their excellent properties containing lightweight, impact strength and thermal insulation. Commonly used polymeric foams are usually made from petroleum-based resin such as polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene, polyurethane and polyvinyl chloride, because of their high cost/performance ratio. With the growing environmental concern about plastic waste disposal, more attention has been placed on biodegradable polymers. As a typical biodegradable and water-soluble polymer, poly(vinyl alcohol)(PVA) possesses good comprehensive properties, such as good mechanical, thermal properties [1,2] and excellent barrier property [3]. Moreover, PVA is more cost-effective than other degradable polymers [4,5]. As for PVA foaming process, it’s an essential technological innovation to use environmentally friendly blowing agents in place of conventional blowing agents such as chlorofluorocarbons and hydro-chlorofluorocarbons [6]. Supercritical carbon dioxide, as a green and environmental blowing agent is one of the most suitable candidates for this purpose because it is inexpensive, nontoxic, nonflammable, chemically inert and easy to achieve from air. Supercritical carbon dioxide foaming technology has been widely used in the production of microcellular glass polymer [7–15]. The preparation of microcellular polymer foam involves in four main steps: (1) uniform polymer/gas solution is formed by saturating sample with supercritical CO2; (2) microcellular nucleation: the thermodynamic instability is induced via a sudden pressure drop or a sudden temperature rising; (3) cell growth; (4) cell stabilization. The process of cell growth is stopped until driving forces vanish and the microcellular foam is obtained [16]. In this paper, the preparation process of PVA foam involves two steps: (1) preparation of PVA sheet (2) solid-state ScCO2 foaming process. In general, PVA-based products are prepared by solution method [17,18] which makes the fabrication process high cost and time consuming. An alternative promising avenue is thermoplastic processing. In reality, the melting temperature of PVA is very close to its decomposition temperature caused by the strong inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonding, which leads to thermal degradation during extrusion processing. Water is considered as an ideal plasticizer for PVA thermal processing because it can increase the flexibility of the PVA chains without causing phase separation. Wang et al. [19] prepared the PVA foam by using water as both the plasticizer and the blowing agent and boric acid was used as a cross-linking agent to enhance the PVA’s melt strength and to improve the cell structure of its foam. Liu et al. [20] combined thermal extrusion and batch foaming technology to prepare porous PVA products by using water as the plasticizer to partially destroy the hydrogen bonding of PVA chains, and the plasticization will decrease the melting point of water plasticized PVA. Zhao et al. [21] reported that water is an economical plasticizer which not only suppresses the potential thermal degradation of PVA but also extends the processing window. Nevertheless, water is prone to causing bubbles during extrusion and water is also unstable in the foaming process, which may render the occurrence of cell coalescence and the nonuniformity of cell size. For this regard, the compound polyol plasticizers that can partially destroy the hydrogen bonding of PVA chains and improve the flowability were developed to pave the way for PVA thermoplastic processing with lower processing temperature and wider processing window. The comprehensive properties of the prepared PVA foam such as cell density and mechanical properties are still below expectation. Moreover, PVA foams prepared at comparative higher pressure and temperature tend to collapse within a few hours. During the ScCO2 foaming process, PVA may be inherently difficult to be the production of high cell density foams without collapse, mainly because of its inherent viscoelasticity, weak melt strength, low solubility of CO2 and low nucleation efficiency. Nanocomposite technology has been regarded as a simple and effective method to prepare better polymeric foam by improving the extensional viscosity, melt strength, and nucleation efficiency within the polymer [22–25]. One of the most common and important fillers used in nanocomposites is nano silica. Some studies have reported that nano silica was applied in PVA hydrogel [26,27], PVA film [28,29] and fiber [30,31] to improve their mechanical properties. Nevertheless, the influence of nano silica on the foaming properties of PVA has not been studied. In this study, the PVA/nano silica nanocomposite sheets were prepared and subsequently foamed in a batch setup under different foaming conditions. Here, considering the polarity of PVA and probability of interfacial interaction between the nano silica and PVA, the nano silica with high content of hydroxyl group is favorable. The production of fine PVA foams is mainly dependent on the internal characteristics, the uniform dispersion of filler and careful control of processing parameters. We systematically investigate the effect of nano silica and processing parameters on cell structure and mechanical properties with nano silica loading ranging from 0 to 1.0% (wt)."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Poly(Vinyl alcohol) (PVA) with a polymerization degree of 1700 and an alcoholysis degree of 88% was purchased from Anhui Wanwei Group Co., Ltd (Anhui, China). The weight-average molecular weight (Mw) was in the range of 72600–81400. Glycerin and Ethylene glycol were supplied by Shanghai Titan Scientific Co., Ltd. CO2 (99.95% of purity) was supplied by Fangxin Gas Inc., Ningbo. Tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, 98%) was purchased from Aladdin Chemical Co., Ltd. Ammonia (NH4OH) was bought from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd."
3,Synthesis of SiO2,"2.2 Synthesis of SiO2 The nano silica was synthesized by using the Stoeber synthesis method [32]. First, 120 mL of ethanol and 9.6 mL of NH4OH hydroxide were stirred for 15 min to form a homogeneous solution in a round flask of 250 mL. Subsequently, 10 mL of TEOS was added into the mixed solution under stirring for 12 h at room temperature. The solution started to turn from defecation to turbidity after 15–20 min, and the solution was finally cream-white. The mixed solution was centrifuged and washed several times using distilled water and ethanol, respectively. Finally, the product was vacuum dried at 60 °C for 12 h, obtaining SiO2."
4,Sample preparation,"2.3 Sample preparation The compound polyol plasticizers were obtained by mixing glycerin and ethylene glycol in a ratio of 1:1. 85 g PVA and different amounts of compound polyol plasticizers, i.e. 0, 8, 16, 20, 24 wt% were vigorously stirred for 60 min at 60 °C to enable the plasticizers to entirely swell into PVA. The procedure to prepare PVA/SiO2 nanocomposites was as follows. First, the quantitative of SiO2 (0, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 wt%) was dispersed in a certain amount of compound polyol plasticizers by sonication. Then, 85 g PVA and the compound polyol plasticizers containing different amounts of SiO2 were vigorously stirred for 1 h at 60 °C. PVA/SiO2 nanocomposites sheet samples of 75 mm × 20 mm × 2 mm in size were prepared by twin-screw extruder. The screw rotation speed, the processing temperature, mold temperature and injection pressure were preset at 30 rpm, 160 °C, 110 °C and 700 bar, respectively. A series of PVA/SiO2 nanocomposites with a nano silica content of 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 wt% were coded as PVAS0.2, PVAS0.5 and PVA1.0, respectively. In this system, the plasticized PVA/SiO2 acted as the foaming matrix and ScCO2 was used as the blowing agent. PVA/SiO2 foams were prepared by the method of mould foaming. The samples were saturated with ScCO2 at constant temperature and pressure for fixed time (the saturation time). Thereafter, release rapidly the gas from the foaming pressure to ambient condition to induce cell nucleation. The foaming temperatures and saturation pressures performed in this experiment were from 130 °C to 165 °C and from 10 MPa to 16 MPa, respectively."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization The interaction of PVA and the compound polyol plasticizers was tested on a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) within the range of 4000–500 cm−1. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements were performed on a Mettler Toledo DSC under a flowing nitrogen atmosphere. All samples of 3–5 mg were heated to 220 °C with a rate of 10 °C/min. The content of hydroxyl groups in SiO2 was measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in a TG/DTA 7300 instrument (Seiko, Chiba, Japan) from 25 to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under a constant nitrogen flow. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) measurements were performed using Xuess System produced by Xenocs Company, France. The X-ray wavelength was 0.154 nm and the size of the primary X-ray beam at the sample position was 0.3 mm × 0.3 mm. The two-dimensional (2D) WAXD patterns were collected by using a Mar CCD X-ray detector (MAR345) with a resolution of 2048 × 2048 pixels. The Fit2d software package [33] was used to carry out the WAXD data analysis. Tensile test of PVA composites was performed on Instron 5567 tension testing machine at a crosshead speed of 10 mm/min. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) measurements were carried out on a DMA+1000 instrument (Metravib, Limonest, France) in a tensile mode. The size of samples used in the test was approximately 25 by 10 by 2 mm. DMA tests were performed at a frequency of 1 Hz and a ramp rate of 3 °C/min from −90 °C to 120 °C with an amplitude of 0.2 mm. To study the uniformity and size of the nano silica particles as well as the dispersion of SiO2 in composites samples, scanning electron microscopy ((Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) images were observed on an SU 70 FE-SEM instrument. All samples were sputtered with gold in vacuum and the observation was conducted at 5 KV. TM3000 scanning electron microscope was applied to analyze the cell structure of PVA foam at accelerating voltage of 15 KV. Before the test, foams were dipped into liquid nitrogen and fractured, and then the fractured surfaces were sputter-coated through a gold coating."
6,Characterization of foams,"2.5 Characterization of foams The mass densities of foamed PVA were determined using a balance equipped with a density measurement kit provided by Mettler Toledo. According to ASTMD 792-00, the mass densities of foamed PVA, ρf , was calculated by [14]: ρ f = a a + w - b ρ water where a, w and b are the quality of the sample in the air, the totally immersed net-like metal cover in water, and the specimen and cover completely immersed in water, respectively. The relative density of the foam, Rρ, was defined as the ratio of the density of the foam (ρf ) relative to that of the solid (ρp ): R ρ = ρ f ρ p The volume expansion ratio (Rv) of the foamed samples can be defined as the reciprocal of Rρ: R v = 1 R ρ The cell morphologies of the foams were characterized using a TM3000 scanning electron microscope (SEM). For each sample, 3–5 images were used. The volume-averaged diameter of all of the cells in the micrograph, Dv, was calculated by D v = ∑ i = 1 n d i 3 n 1 / 3 where n is the number of cells and di is the perimeter-equivalent diameter of each counted cell. The cell density, Nf , defined as the number of cells per unit volume of foam, was calculated by [34] N f = n M 2 A 3 / 2 where n is the number of cells in the micrograph, A is the area of the micrograph (cm2), M is the magnification factor. The cell density, N0 , defined as the number of cells per unit volume of the original (un-foamed) sample, was calculated by N 0 = N f × R v"
7,Results and discussion,
8,Plastication of PVA,"3.1 Plastication of PVA The FTIR is used to study the possible interactions between plasticizer and PVA. The FTIR spectra of pure PVA and PVA/plasticizer are shown in Fig. 1 . From the curve of PVA, a broad and strong brand at around 3419 cm−1 is observed, which is attributed to the stretching vibration of hydroxyl group. Compared with pure PVA, the O-H stretching band of PVA/plasticizer red shifts to 3449 cm−1 which indicates that the addition of plasticizer may partially destroy intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonding within PVA and form weaker inter-molecular hydrogen bonding with PVA [35,36]. The change of intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen boning by adding plasticizer plays a key role for thermoplastic processing of PVA, which will be further confirmed by DSC analysis. Fig. 2 shows the DSC curves of the effect of different contents of the compound polyol plasticizers on melt behavior of modified PVA system. With increasing the contents of plasticizer, the melting temperature and the degree of crystallinity decrease obviously. However, phase separation occurs when the amount of plasticizer is more than 24 wt%. Combined with the results of FTIR analysis, we can come to a conclusion that plasticizers diffuse into the amorphous regions and imperfect regions of PVA which disrupts intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonding in PVA. At last, the thermal processing of PVA is successfully realized by increasing the free volume and the flexibility of the PVA chains and reducing the crystallinity of PVA."
9,The appearance of PVA foam,"3.2 The appearance of PVA foam Fig. S1 shows the optical photographs of PVA/plasticizer foams with different relative density (see Supporting Information). It is obvious that serious collapse of bubbles occurs at the condition of low relative density. There may be two reasons for this phenomenon. One of these relates to the difference between the permeability of nitrogen and CO2 in PVA. The CO2 in the PVA bubbles is easy to penetrate the PVA wall to the atmosphere while nitrogen is difficult to exchange with the CO2 in the atmosphere in the same period of time. Hence the pressure in the bubbles drops gradually and the bubble collapse occurs and becomes more serious as time goes on. Another cause may relate to PVA internal characteristics, such as inherent viscoelasticity. In order to ease the collapse of bubbles and improve the foaming performances, we prepared nano silica, and introduced it into the system."
10,Characterization and dispersion of SiO2,"3.3 Characterization and dispersion of SiO2 By carefully investigating the preparation parameters, we have obtained uniformly distributed and nano-sized silica particles. TGA curve of pure SiO2 is shown in Fig. 3 . The weight loss between 30 and 200 °C is mainly due to the dehydration of adhered water. In the temperature range of 200–700 °C, dehydration condensation reactions of the silicon alcohol groups (Si-OH) within the SiO2 occur [37], and the weight loss is about 5.35 wt%. The uniformity and size of the nano silica particles were confirmed by SEM (see Fig. 4 a and b), which indicates that the prepared SiO2 has a mean diameter of about 150 nm and exhibits excellent uniformity. It is well known that the performances of polymer nanocomposites strongly depend on the dispersion of nanofillers and the interfacial interaction between the nanoparticles and the matrix. Considering the polarity of PVA and probability of interfacial interaction between the nano silica and PVA, the nano silica with high content of hydroxyl group (5.35 wt%, by TGA) are prepared. To discuss the dispersibility of SiO2 in PVA matrix, the freeze-fractured surfaces of PVAS nanocomposites are observed, and the results are shown in Fig. 4c and d. On the whole, SiO2 is uniformly dispersed in the samples without obvious aggregation."
11,Effect of SiO2 content on foaming behavior,"3.4 Effect of SiO2 content on foaming behavior After successfully preparation of well-dispersed PVAS nanocomposites, we systemically studied the effects of foaming temperature and saturation pressure on the cell morphologies of PVAS nanocomposites in this work. Table 1 shows the foaming conditions. 3.4.1 Effect of the foaming temperature We study the influence of the foaming temperature on the foaming behavior and cell structure of PVAS nanocomposites at 14 MPa saturation pressure for 30 min. Fig. 5 shows the microstructure of PVAS foams with different SiO2 contents at different foaming temperature. It is obvious that the foams exhibit a finely closed cell structure with polygon shapes and cell walls get thinner and thinner and become prone to rupture with increasing the foaming temperature. When temperature is too high, cell coalescence may occur due to the lower melt strength. As shown in Fig. 6 a and b, the average cell size increases as the foaming temperature increases whereas the cell density decreases accordingly. This is due to a decrease in the solubility of CO2 in the polymer matrix with increasing the foaming temperature [38]. The energy barrier to nucleation will become so high that the nucleation sites reduce, leading to the decrease of cell density. It is well-known that the viscosity of a polymer will decrease and the CO2 diffusivity will increase as the temperature increases [39], hence the cells tend to grow more easily and faster at higher temperature. In addition, the foaming temperature increases with the incorporation of the nano silica particles. As the content of SiO2 increases, PVAS nanocomposite foams exhibit a cellular structure with smaller cell size and larger cell density, this may relate to the enhancement of stiffness by adding SiO2 which will be discussed as follows. Moreover, the addition of SiO2 reduces the free energy barrier of cell nucleation, providing heterogeneous nucleation sites for PVA foaming, increasing the cell nucleation rate, thereby increasing the cell density and decreasing the cell size. Compared with PVA foams, the addition of SiO2 obviously eases the collapse of bubbles due to the larger cell density. Fig. 6c shows the relative density of PVAS nanocomposite foams as a function of foaming temperature. It can be seen clearly that the relative density has a negative correlation with the foaming temperature. At the foaming temperature of 130–145 °C, it is seen that the increase in foaming temperature decreases the relative density of PVA foams from 0.43 to 0.2. The incorporation of nano silica has a significant effect on the relative density of PVA foams. The lowest relative density 0.16, 0.1 and 0.11 are obtained at the highest foaming temperature for PVAS0.2, PLAS0.5 and PLAS1.0, respectively. Compared with PVAS0.5 and PVAS1.0 foam, the average cell size, the cell density and the relative density are similar. 3.4.2 Effect of the saturation pressure Fig. 7 shows the cell morphologies of PVAS nanocomposite foams obtained at 160 °C with various saturation pressures for 30 min. As shown in Fig. 8 a, the average cell size decreases with increasing saturation pressure while the cell density increases. It is well-known that the solubility of CO2 in polymer matrix becomes larger with increasing saturation pressure for a given temperature [38,40]. Moreover, a higher saturation pressure will contribute to the reduction of nucleation energy barrier, which leads to large amounts of cells. It can be also observed that the average size is smaller and cell density is larger at a higher content of SiO2. Fig. 8b shows the relative density of PVAS nanocomposite foams as a function of saturation pressure. As saturation pressure increases, relative density decreases."
12,Mechanical properties of PVAS nanocomposites,"3.5 Mechanical properties of PVAS nanocomposites Incorporating SiO2 into PVA not only improves the heterogeneous efficiency and melt strength during foaming process just like the above-mentioned results, but also enhance the mechanical properties and inherent viscoelasticity of nanocomposites, which may play a very important role in preparing better polymeric foam. 3.5.1 Tensile test The stress-strain curves of PVA and PVAS nanocomposites with different contents of SiO2 are shown in Fig. 9 . It is observed that the tensile strength of PVA is the lowest and is approximately 8 MPa. It is obvious that the tensile strength improves significantly with increasing the amount of SiO2. When the content of SiO2 is 0.5 wt%, the tensile strength nearly increases by 150% to 20 MPa. The tensile modulus also increases as the amount of SiO2 increases. In contrast, the elongation at break of PVAS nanocomposites decreases with the increase of SiO2 contents. The improvement of tensile strength is attributed to the interfacial interaction between the nanoparticles and the matrix as well as the rigidity of SiO2. 3.5.2 Dynamic mechanical properties Dynamical mechanical analyses were performed in PVA, PVAS0.2, PVA0.5 and PVAS1.0. The variation of storage modulus as a function of temperature is graphically enumerated in Fig. 10 a. As temperature increases, modulus decreases and then there is a sudden drop in the modulus in the glass transition region, which corresponds to the glass-rubber transition of PVA chains. The modulus decreases in the glassy state while increases slightly in the rubbery region with increasing content of SiO2. Modulus in the rubbery region increases slightly with increasing SiO2 content because of the stiffening effect of the nano silica and the interfacial interaction between SiO2 and the matrix. It is well-known that the storage modulus decreases as the degree of crystallinity decreases. The decrease of storage modulus in the glass state may due to a decrease in crystallinity, which will be confirmed by WAXD analysis. The storage modulus of PVA at room temperature is 27.4 MPa, while that of PVAS nanocomposites nearly increases by 120% upon the addition of 0.5 wt% SiO2. In additional, the storage modulus of PVA and PVAS nanocomposite foams were examined. As shown in Fig. 11 a, the modulus of PVAS0.5 nanocomposite foams in the rubbery region is much higher than that of PVA foam under the same expansion ratio conditions (e.g. nearly increased by 67% at room temperature), which is important for preparing better polymeric foam. The damping properties of the material balance the elastic phase and the viscous phase in a polymer structure. The variation of tanδ as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 10b. With increasing temperature, tanδ reaches the maximum in the transition region and then decreases in the rubber region. Tanδ is low below Tg because molecular chain segments are in frozen state, while tanδ is high in the transition region which can be attributed to the initiation of the micro-Brownian motion of the molecular chain segment and stress relaxation, although not all segments will participate in this relaxation together. The maximum tanδ occur in the region where most of the chain segments participate in the cooperative diffusion motion under a definite deformation. It is observed from Fig. 10b that the glass transition temperature (Tg, defined as the peak temperature of the tan δ curve) shifts to a higher temperature with increasing the content of SiO2, which reduces the segmental mobility and hinders the movement of the PVA molecular chains. Compared with PVA, the peak height of tan δ lowers after the addition of SiO2, this may be due to the fact that SiO2-PVA adhesion is good which limits the mobility of the polymer chains. The lower the damping value, the better the bearing capacity of the composite. As we can see from Fig. 11b, Tg of PVA foam also shifts to a higher temperature in the presence of SiO2. However, compared with the unfoamed counterparts, Tg of foamed samples is lower resulting from the expansion of volume of the foamed sample, which allows the molecular chains to move more freely."
13,WAXD analysis,"3.6 WAXD analysis Fig. 12 gives the 2D WAXD patterns of PVA and PVAS nanocomposites with different contents of SiO2. The differences in the patterns indicate the enhancement of crystal orientation which may contribute to the improvement of tensile strength. The corresponding WAXD curves of samples collected from 2D WAXD pattern are shown in Fig. 13 . It can be seen that PVA and PVAS have similar diffraction curves. We calculate the crystallinity (Xc) for all samples and the results are shown in Table 2 . With increasing the content of SiO2, the crystallinity reduces, which can explain that the storage modulus decreases in the glass state as the nano silica content increases. The reason for the reduction of crystallinity is that SiO2 has an effect of inducing heterogeneous nucleation and it will act as a barrier that may restrict the PVA chains’ thermal motion to form crystals, and consequently delay the overall crystallisation process [41]."
14,Conclusions,"Microcellular poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/SiO2 nanocomposite foams with controlled cellular structure were prepared through thermoplastic processing technology by using supercritical carbon dioxide as physical blowing agent. Glycerin and ethylene glycol as the compound polyol plasticizers that can partially destroy the hydrogen bonding of PVA chains and improve the flowability were developed to pave the way for PVA thermoplastic processing with lower processing temperature and wider processing window. In order to ease the collapse of bubbles and improve the foaming performances, nano silica was introduced into the system. The nano silica was synthesized by a one-step, remodeled synthetic sol-gel process and characterized with respect to the content of hydroxyl groups, particle size, and morphology by TGA and SEM. The prepared SiO2 with a hydroxyl group content of 5.35 wt% had a mean diameter of about 150 nm and exhibited excellent uniformity. What’s more, SiO2 was uniformly dispersed in the samples without obvious aggregation. The effects of processing parameters and the addition of nano silica on the foaming behavior and cellular structure were systematically investigated. A low foaming temperature and a high saturation pressure contributed to high cell density. PVAS nanocomposite foams have smaller average cell size and larger cell density and relative density than the PVA foams under the same foaming conditions. The reason for this is that the high matrix stiffness restricted the cell growth and SiO2 acted as heterogeneous cites to facilitate the bubbles nucleation process. In additional, when the content of SiO2 was 0.5 wt%, the foaming temperature window was expanded to about 20 °C, making the foaming process of PVA much easier. SiO2 had a reinforcing effect on PVA which was confirmed by both tensile and DMA tests, while the elongation at break decreased with increasing SiO2 contents. It was found that Tg shifted toward higher temperatures and the peak height of tan δ lowered with the incorporation of SiO2. Wide angle X-ray diffraction results showed that the addition of nano silica enhanced the degree of orientation of PVA crystals in the flow direction but reduced the crystallinity."
