0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2) is considered as a promising and ideal source of energy for the future. This is due to the factor that it is clean and it produces an amount of energy that is higher than the one produced by other fuel on a mass basis (122kJg−1) [1]. In addition, its low heating value (LHV) is 2.4, 2.8 and 4 times higher than methane, gasoline and coal respectively [2]. For these reason, the amount of energy produced during H2 combustion is higher than that released by any other fuel on a mass basis. Besides, significant use of H2 will contribute to the reduction of energy-linked environmental impacts, including global warming due to anthropogenic carbon emissions, mobile source emissions such as CO, NO x , SO x , non-methane hydrocarbons, and particulates [3]. Current utilization of H2 is equivalent to 3% of the energy consumption. It is used as a reactant in hydrogenation processes in ammonia and methanol production, an oxygen (O2) scavenger, a fuel in rocket engines and a coolant in electrical generators [4]. In accordance with sustainable development and waste minimization issues, biological H2 production from renewable sources, also known as “green technology” has received considerable attention in recent years [5]. Photosynthetic bacteria have been studied extensively, for their capacity to produce significant amounts of H2. Hydrogen production by photosynthetic bacteria is mediated by nitrogenase activity particularly in the absence of molecular nitrogen and oxygen (i.e. in the presence of argon) [6–8]. However, H2 production is not advantageous if argon is used as sparging gas and this is a potential obstacle to an eventual efficient and economical commercial process. A study has discovered four mutant strains of the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris that produced H2 constitutively, even in the presence of ammonium, a condition where wild-type cells do not accumulate detectable amounts of H2 [9]. Photosynthetic bacteria are found to be the most promising as compared to other microbial system due to its high substrate to product conversion yield, lack of oxygen-evolving activity (which is desirable for biohydrogen production), ability to use a wide wavelength of light, and capability to consume organic substrates (derived from wastes) for H2 production that also helps in bioremediation process (wastewater treatment) [10]. Photosynthetic bacteria carry out anoxygenic photosynthesis using organic compounds and reduced sulfur compounds electron donors, which are categorized as non-sulfur and sulfur photosynthetic bacteria respectively [11]. Some purple non-sulfur bacteria (PNS) are strong H2 producers utilizing organic acids that are produced through the breakdown process of organic substrate, such as lactic, succinic and butyric acids or alcohol [12]. They constitute a non-taxonomic group of versatile organisms which can grow as photoheterotrophs, photoautotrophs or chemoheterotrophs-switching from one mode to another depending on available conditions such as degree of anaerobiosis, availability of carbon source (CO2 for autotrophic growth, organic compounds for heterotrophic growth) and availability of a light source (needed for phototrophic growth) [6]. Palm oil mill effluent (POME) generated from palm oil milling processes to produce crude palm oil (CPO) is the most polluting agro-industrial effluent. It is estimated that 0.5–0.75 tonne of raw POME were produced for every tonne of fresh fruit bunches (FFB) processed [13]. POME is rich in organic carbon with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 50,000mg/l, biological oxygen demand (BOD), 30,000mg/l, oil and grease, 6000mg/l, suspended solids, 59,350mg/l and 750mg/l of total nitrogen [14]. Several studies on biohydrogen production from POME have been carried out by using anaerobic microflora [15–17]. However, the photofermentation of H2 production from POME by using photosynthetic bacteria has barely been explored. In this study, H2 production from POME by using phototrophic bacteria R. palustris strain PBUM001 was investigated. Response surface methodology (RSM) using Box-Behnken design was employed in planning the experiments for evaluating the individual and interactive effects of process parameters namely, POME concentration, light intensity, inoculums size, pH and agitation rate on biohydrogen production and COD reduction simultaneously."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microorganism and medium,2.1 Microorganism and medium R. palustris PBUM001 was isolated from rice noodle processing wastewater [18] and used throughout this study. The PBUM001 strain was grown and maintained in Glutamate malate medium (GMM) [18]. The initial pH value of the medium was adjusted to 7.0 by 0.1N NaOH. The cells were grown anaerobically at 30±2°C for 48h under continuous illumination by tungsten light bulbs at 2.5klux.
3,Sample collection and preparation,"2.2 Sample collection and preparation Palm oil mill effluent (POME) was collected from a local palm oil mill in Dengkil (Selangor, Malaysia). The collected POME was initially pre-settled for 24h in 4°C cold room and centrifuged at 7000rpm for 15min. The supernatant was stored in plastic bags in a freezer at −20°C in order to prevent the wastewater from undergoing biodegradation due to microbial action [18]. The POME was thawed at 4°C and the remaining solids in the POME were filtered with Whatman (No. 1) filter paper. The pH of filtered wastewater was adjusted to required pH (i.e. 6, 7, 8) and autoclaved at 121°C for 15min prior to its use as a culture media. The characteristics of the raw and pre-treated POME were analyzed [20]."
4,Seed culture,"2.3 Seed culture Seed culture was prepared by adjusting the bacterial culture to 0.2g drywt/L at OD660 of 0.3. R. palustris PBUM001, at 10% (v/v) was acclimatized in sterilized 25% (v/v) diluted POME in serum bottles and were flushed with nitrogen (N2) gas for 4min and sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminium caps. Then the cultures were grown under the same condition as growing in GMM. The serum bottle was agitated continuously at 150rpm for 48h. The acclimatized PBUM001 strain (seed culture) was used for further studies."
5,Experimental design and procedure,"2.4 Experimental design and procedure Response surface methodology (RSM) has been widely used in the optimization of biohydrogen production process [21–24]. The RSM used in this study investigates the effects of process parameters namely POME concentration, light intensity, inoculum size, agitation rate and pH on H2 production and COD reduction by PBUM001 strain. Box-Behnken design was used which comprised of three levels, low (−1), central (0), and high (+1). It was chosen because it required fewer experiments, was more efficient and easier to arrange and interpret in comparison to others. The level and code of variables considered in this study are shown in Table 2a . Accordingly, a total of 138 runs involving the replication of the central points for each six blocks, were used to optimize the process parameters (Table 2b ). Two responses were predicted from RSM, that is, cumulative H2 production (ml) and COD reduction (%). The Minitab® 14 software was used in the experimental design, data analysis, quadratic model buildings, and graph (three-dimensional response surface and contour) plotting. The experiments were conducted in serum bottles (total volume of 121ml) containing sterilized POME with 50ml working volume. The bottles were flushed with N2 gas for 4min and sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminium caps. The samples were seeded and incubated for 66h under various conditions of pH, light intensity (klux), inoculum size (% v/v), agitation rate (rpm) and POME concentration (% v/v). The composition of gas products was measured after 66h. The biogas produced was collected using air-tight syringe (Terumo, Japan) and stored in bottles containing acidic water (<pH 3) using water displacement method in order to prevent dissolution of the gas components [15]. The gas composition was determined by gas chromatography (Shimadzu Corp., Japan, GC-8A), equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD), Porapak Q column, N2 as carrier gas, detector/injector temperature at 100°C, column temperature at 50°C. 1ml of the gas sample was injected in replicate. The H2 gas production was calculated from headspace measurements and the cumulative H2 production for each time interval using the mass balance equation (Eq. (1)) [19]: (1) V H,i = V H,i − 1 + C H,i ( V G,i − V G,i − 1 ) + V H ( C H,i − C H,i − 1 ) , where V H,i and V H, i−1 denote cumulative H2 gas volumes (ml) at the current (i) and previous (i−1) time intervals, respectively, V G, i and V G, i−1 denote the total biogas volumes (ml) in the current and previous time intervals, C H,i and C H, i−1 denote the fraction of hydrogen gas (%) in the current and previous time intervals, and V H denotes the total volume of headspace in the reactor (67ml)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,The POME analysis,"3.1 The POME analysis Selected physical and chemical properties of POME are shown in Table 1. Raw POME has high temperature within the range of 80–100°C, while the pH of POME was slightly acidic. The COD of raw POME is high reflecting the presence of substantial amount of organic matter content. It began to reduce when pre-treatment in the form of gravity settling was applied. Raw POME contained high concentration of suspended solids. Therefore, pre-treatment to remove the suspended solids was required for satisfactory light penetration to accommodate the photosynthetic growth of PBUM001 strain."
8,Cumulative H2 production,"3.2 Cumulative H2 production The experimental results of cumulative H2 are shown in Table 2b. The multiple regression analysis using Minitab® 14 software showed the importance of main effect and interaction effects of five (5) variables based on the responses of maximum cumulative H2 production and COD reduction of POME. POME concentration, light intensity and agitation rate showed significant effect to the cumulative H2 production and COD reduction, where P <0.05. On the other hand, the effect of pH and inoculum size was shown to be not significant as the P >0.05. The inoculum size range studied (10%, 20% and 30% v/v) did not have significant influence on the cumulative H2 production and COD reduction. Similarly, the pH range studied (6, 7 and 8) showed insignificant effect on both responses. It was reported that the H2 started to be produced by R. palustris grown in aromatic acids substrate when the pH is in the range of 6–8 and the optimum value was at 7 [25]. Hence, subsequent simulation would employ the lowest value of inoculum size and pH viz. 10% (v/v) and 6, respectively. The predicted values of responses (cumulative H2 and COD reduction) were obtained from full quadratic model fitting techniques, where the model includes the main effects, the square effects and interaction effects. The regression equation was generated for the response surface of cumulative H2 production which is given as in Eq. (2). (2) Y = − 20.156 + 0.7543 A + 8.251 B − 3.3198 C + 0.2534 D + 0.1172 E − 0.0019 A 2 − 1.7098 B 2 + 0.4278 C 2 − 0.0109 D 2 − 0.0004 E 2 + 0.0423 AB − 0.0709 AC − 0.0068 AD + 0.0012 AE + 0.3417 BC − 0.0618 BD + 0.0109 BE + 0.1098 CD − 0.0074 CE − 0.0009 DE where Y (yield) is the cumulative H2 production, ml; A is the POME concentration, % (v/v); B is the light intensity, klux; C is the pH; D is the inoculum size, % (v/v); and E is the agitation rate, rpm. The interactive parameters for Eq. (2) and their significance levels are shown in Table 3 . The coefficient of multiple determination, R 2 was found to be 0.657, which suggests that the model could explain 65.7% of the total variation in the system. In order to check the adequacy of the model to represent the system further, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the response was summarized in Table 4 . The model F statistic was found to be 10.35 corresponding to P-value of 0, which implies that model is adequate. The blocks effect of the system gave a value of 0.184 implying insignificant effect on the blocks. The analysis of experimental data collected indicated that normality assumption for H2 production is satisfied (data not shown). The contour plots were generated to understand the interaction of the parameters required for optimum yield (cumulative H2 production). The contour plots are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 for agitation rate vs. POME concentration and light intensity vs. POME concentration, respectively. Eq. (2) was used in the generation of the contour plots. Two parameters of each model were plotted at any one time on X- and Y-axes with the yield value in Z-axis. The other remaining parameters were fixed at constant values (e.g. light intensity, 2.5klux; pH 6; agitation rate, 250rpm and inoculum size, 10% (v/v)). Since the main effect of pH and inoculum size were found not to be significant, their values in subsequent simulation were set at minimum i.e. 6 and 10% (v/v) respectively. The mutual interactions between variables are indicated by the shape of the contour plots (circular or elliptical) [26]. The elliptical nature of the contour plot (Fig. 1) indicated that the interactions between POME concentration and agitation rate were significant. This is also evident from the P-value (0.036<0.05) in Table 3. It was noticed that cumulative H2 production tended to increase with gradually increasing value of agitation rate. Simultaneously, this shows that R. palustris PBUM001 could produce more H2 by applying adequate mixing. This agrees well with the report that the mixing facilitates the distribution of the cells within the culture, aiding the homogenous exposure of the microorganisms to light and substrate [12]. Fig. 2 depicts the contour plot showing the effects of POME concentration and light intensity on cumulative H2 production. The circular nature of the contour plots indicated that no interactions between light intensity and POME concentration were found to contribute to the response (cumulative H2 production) at a significant level, due to the high P-value (0.150>0.05) in Table 3. Fig. 2 shows that the cumulative H2 production increased gradually with the increasing of POME concentration and light intensity. While all the remaining parameters were fixed at constant values, the effect of light intensity on cumulative H2 production was insignificant. The light intensity does not effect cumulative H2 production at lower concentration of POME. When POME concentration was at a higher level, cumulative H2 production steadily increased with increasing of light intensity. It was evident that the production of H2 was at higher than 50ml when POME concentration in the range of 91–100% (v/v) and light intensity in the range of 3.4–5.5klux. By analyzing Figs. 1 and 2, the optimum predicted yield of cumulative H2 production lies in the following ranges of the examined variables: POME concentration 87–100% (v/v), agitation rate 169–250rpm and light intensity 3.4–5.5klux."
9,COD reduction,"3.3 COD reduction The COD reduction is optimized simultaneously with cumulative H2 production. The experimental results of COD reduction are shown in Table 2b. The predicted values of response (COD reduction) were obtained from full quadratic model fitting techniques, where the model includes the main effects, the square effects and the interaction effects. The regression equation for the response surface of COD reduction (%) was generated and given as in Eq. (3). (3) Y = 143.385 + 1.091 A − 3.453 B − 34.617 C − 2.003 D − 0.206 E − 0.003 A 2 − 1.477 B 2 + 2.746 C 2 + 0.021 D 2 + 0.001 E 2 + 0.015 AB − 0.128 AC + 0.008 AD + 0.001 AE + 1.613 BC + 0.248 BD − 0.023 BE + 0.013 CD + 0.009 CE where Y (yield) is the COD reduction, %; A is the POME concentration, % (v/v); B is the light intensity, klux; C is the pH; D is the inoculum size, % (v/v); and E is the agitation rate, rpm. The significance of each coefficient was determined by t values and P-values which are listed in Table 5 . The larger the magnitude of t-test value and smaller the P-value indicates the high significance of the corresponding parameter [27]. It can be seen that the linear effect, quadratic effect and interaction effect of the variables are not significant, where the P-values are more than 0.05. The model coefficient of multiple determination, R 2 was found to be 0.32 explaining 32% of the variability in the response. The ANOVA of quadratic regression model demonstrates that the model is significant, as is evident from the P <0.05 (Table 6 ). The validity of ANOVA assumption and model adequacy was investigated by the examination of residuals. Simple graphical method was used to assist in analyzing the data from the experiment. Standardized residuals (Fig. 3 ) indicated the underlying error distribution is normal as the data plots resemble a straight line. Fig. 4 presented a histogram for 138 runs on the COD reduction (%). The histogram shows the central tendency, spread and general shape of the distribution of the data. This shows that all errors are lack of systematic trend which indicating the errors are attributed to random error only. Fig. 5 plots the residuals vs. observation order of experiments. The plots indicate the order of experiments has no influence on the data obtained. Similar plots to Figs. 3–5 were generated for cumulative H2 production data. These plots showed no deviation from normality assumption and error is random in nature (plots not shown). The 2D contour plots are the graphical representations of the regression equation (Eq. (3)). Figs. 6 and 7 show the effects of agitation rate vs. POME concentration and light intensity vs. POME concentration on COD reduction, respectively. The nature of both contour plots (Figs. 6 and 7) is circular that indicated there were no evident interaction relationships existing between the respective parameters on COD reduction. Fig. 6 shows at low POME concentration, the effect of agitation rate on COD reduction was negligible. When the concentration of POME was increased to 63–100% (v/v), COD reduction steadily increases with increasing of agitation speed (213–250rpm). Fig. 7 shows the effects of light intensity and POME concentration on COD reduction. Similarly, the contour plots (Fig. 7) indicated that there was no evident interaction relationship between the two chosen parameter (light intensity and POME concentration) on COD reduction. From Fig. 7, COD reduction increased gradually with the increasing of POME concentration and decreasing of light intensity. These factors are important in term of energy saving during the potential POME treatment by keeping appropriate light intensity, which can make the whole process more economical and feasible. The plots of Figs. 6 and 7 were analyzed and the optimum predicted COD reduction (%) lies in the following ranges of the examined variables: POME concentration at 42–100% (v/v), agitation rate at 212–250rpm and light intensity at 2.5–4.2klux. Again in this particular simulation, pH and inoculum size were fixed at minimum values."
10,Optimization of H2 production and COD reduction and validation of the models,"3.4 Optimization of H2 production and COD reduction and validation of the models Overlaid contour plot (Fig. 8 ) was used to indicate the region where optimization routine will search for optimal points. Optimizer function in Minitab® 14 was used to maximize the desired responses within specified boundaries. For cumulative H2 production, its boundary comprised of minimum 40ml and 60ml of cumulative H2, whereas for COD reduction the boundary is made up of minimum 5% and maximum 50% of COD reduction. The optimum conditions determined were POME concentration, 100% (v/v); light intensity, 4.0klux; pH 6, inoculum size, 10% (v/v) and agitation rate, 250rpm. Purple non-sulfur bacteria utilize organic acids to produce H2. For that reason, POME concentration at 100% (v/v) resulted in optimal H2 production and COD reduction due to the higher content of organic acids compared to the diluted POME. The light intensity had considerable effect on H2 production and COD reduction at the optimal value of 4.0klux. It has been reported that light intensity of 3.0klux or higher were appropriate for good H2 production by a photosynthetic bacterium, Rhodopseudomonas capsulata [23]. The optimal agitation rate at 250rpm shows that mixing intensity at this level is sufficient for desired cumulative H2 production and COD reduction. Overlaid contour plot for simultaneous production of cumulative H2 and COD reduction did not indicate any possible area for optimization routine with respect to light intensity and POME concentration parameters (plot not shown). The predicted response of cumulative H2 production was 1.05ml H2/ml POME and COD reduction at 31.7%. The composite desirability was at 0.60775. The verification experiments were conducted under optimized conditions. The cumulative H2 production of 0.66±0.07ml H2/ml POME and 30.54±9.85% COD reduction were obtained under the optimum conditions. These results were considered to be adequate and acceptable. When compared with other studies using wastewater as substrate, the present study obtained H2 production rate of 0.01L H2/L POME/h which was higher than that of sewage [28], carbohydrate fed fermentation effluent [29], whey [30] and olive mill wastewater (OMW) [31] (Table 7 )."
11,Conclusions,"Conventional process of optimization is usually time consuming and expensive. Single-variable optimization methods are monotonous and they can also lead to misinterpretation of results that are used to select the precise factors that influenced the process. The use of an experimental design where the main aim was to reveal the influence of POME concentration, light intensity, inoculum size, pH and agitation rate on H2 production and COD reduction also allows the rapid screening of large experimental domain in search of the optimized conditions for H2 production and COD reduction simultaneously. The significant achievement of the present study lies in the fact that H2 production was found to be acceptable despite the sparging gas used was N2 gas. The optimization of H2 production from POME resulted in the simultaneous reduction of COD of the POME. The chosen method of optimization of H2 production and COD reduction was efficient, relatively simple as well as time and material saving."
