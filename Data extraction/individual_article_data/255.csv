0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is currently considered a vector of clean energy with a broad technology portfolio that includes classical utilization in many chemical industry reactions such as organic chemistry hydrogenation, crude refining, or many others. In addition, more recent fields such as hydrogen fuel cell transportation vehicles are expanding the use of this energy vector and will facilitate the transition to a novel economy respectful with the environment. Considering the growing demand of hydrogen, there is a need for novel technologies of production. Heterogeneous photocatalysis is one advanced process that uses semiconductors and light and is also able to generate hydrogen from renewable sources [1–4]. Photocatalysis most significant advantage with respect to other technologies could be the use of solar energy, a free and renewable energy source. The use of such energy sources at ambient pressure and temperature and the usage of bio-derived reactants such as alcohols can lead to a truly green, environmentally benign process [1,5]. One of the materials potentially interesting for sunlight-driven photocatalytic applications is the graphite like carbon nitride (g-C3N4). Graphitic carbon nitride consists on a graphite like structure of tris-z-triazine layers connected through amino groups. A survey of literature reports points out that g-C3N4 good electronic and chemical properties and thermal stability triggered the use of the g-C3N4-based single or composite materials as metal free catalysts for many photochemical reactions such as organic photodegradation, water splitting or alcohol reforming [6–22]. The activity of the carbon nitride materials is commonly promoted with the help of metals such as Ag, Au, Pt [23–34]. In the case of hydrogen production from bio-alcohols, Pt has been shown to be the most active co-catalysts irrespective of the sacrificial agent and, in general, reaction conditions such as pH, water: sacrificial agent molar ratio, catalyst concentration, etc. [16–18,35]. In spite of it, the Pt-g-C3N4 system requires further improvement of the photo-catalytic properties and a potential pathway corresponds to the doping of the carbon nitride semiconductor [6,7,15–18]. Boron has been shown to be one good choice for increasing significantly reaction rates in several reactions related to pollutant elimination or hydrogen photocatalytic production [36–42]. The catalytic role of boron in the activity enhancement of the g-C3N4-based materials depends critically of the preparation method and this in turn appears directly related to the position occupied by the boron at or in the carbon nitride network. Apart from oxo-hydroxide supported species, boron can be exchanged with hydrogen of terminal amine groups (and others surface groups) or located at carbon substitutional positions [36–39]. The (potential) structural complexity of the boron doped carbon nitride powders and the physico-chemical roots of the positive or negative effects exerted by the different boron species on photo-activity are thus important challenges that require further analysis in order to fully understand the functional properties of such solids. As mentioned, this contribution aims to analyze the production of hydrogen from bio-alcohols by Pt-loaded B-doped carbon nitride materials. Paralleling the biomass derived (low molecular weight) alcohol reforming industrial processes carried out in thermal catalysis we will work in the gas phase reforming of methanol [43,44]. We will examine the contributions from UV and visible light to the catalytic activity and the potential utilization of both components in the quest of using solar light as a renewable source of the process. In addition, we will calculate the quantum efficiency as a quantitative measure of activity. The IUPAC recommendations indicate that (in contraposition to the photonic yield or apparent quantum efficiency) the calculation of the quantum efficiency is mandatory to compare the photoactivity of different samples as alternative comparisons based on conversion or reaction rates are commonly misleading [45]. This task demands the modeling of the light-matter interaction in the reactor where catalytic measurements are conducted. Moreover, as detailed in numerous previous publications, we thoroughly analyzed the catalytic response of the materials to the known main experimental variables of the reaction, the water:alcohol ratio, catalyst(s) concentration and light intensity [3,17,32,35]. Here we developed an intrinsic kinetic model to interpret the catalysts response [46]. Catalytic powders were simultaneous characterized using a multitechnique approach with the help of x-ray diffraction, microscopy, UV–visible and photoluminescence spectroscopies. By combining the analysis of the catalytic results with the physico-chemical characterization just outlined together with a study of the charge carrier handling and recombination by the catalytic solids we were able to spot out the main beneficial effects driving the functional properties of the solids and quantify their importance."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Sample preparation,"2.1 Sample preparation The B-g-C3N4 materials were prepared by thermal polymerization of physical mixtures of dicyandiamide (Aldrich, 99%) and H3BO3 (Aldrich, 99.5%). First, 10 g dicyandiamide were dissolved in 20 mL of water. Then, the desired amount of H3BO3 was added to the dicyandiamide solution, heated, stirred and dried at 80 °C. The dry product was put in a muffle and heated to 550 °C for 2 h. After grinding, a similar second calcination step was carried out, but in this case at 500 °C. A g-C3N4 reference was obtained following the previously described process without adding H3BO3. The co-catalyst was introduced by a deposition method using a H2PtCl6 (Aldrich) solution. First, the sample was suspended by stirring in a deionized water solution for 30 min. After that, the proper quantity of H2PtCl6 was added to the solution (to get throughout the series a constant 0.4 mol% or 1 wt% of Pt on metal basis) and kept on stirring 5 min more. The reduction was carried out using a NaBH4 (Aldrich) aqueous solution (Pt/NaBH4 molar ratio 1/5). The final solid was profusely rinsed with deionized water, collected by centrifugation and dried at 80 °C. Chemical analysis (measured using atomic emission with inductive coupled plasma (ICP-AES) using an Optima 3300DV Perkin Elmer spectrometer) provided a boron and platinum content corresponding to the nominal ones of the samples with an error of 3.6% and 2.4%, respectively. So, the samples were labeled as Pt/xB-g-C3N4 with x being the boron weight content of the synthesis. A Pt/g-C3N4 powder prepared using the same procedure (without B containing species) was also studied."
3,Characterization methods,"2.2 Characterization methods The BET surface areas and average pore volumes and sizes were measured by nitrogen physisorption (Micromeritics ASAP 2010). XRD profiles were obtained using a Seifert D-500 diffractometer using Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation with a 0.02° step. The particle sizes were estimated using XRD using the Williamson–Hall formalism [47]. UV–vis diffuse-reflectance spectroscopy experiments were performed on a Shimadzu UV2100 apparatus using nylon as a reference and the results presented as Kubelka–Munk transform [48]. Band gap analysis for the g-C3N4 indirect gap semiconductor was performed following standard procedures; e.g., plotting (hνa)n (n = ½ or 2 for indirect or direct semiconductor; hν = excitation energy, a = absorption coefficient) vs. energy and obtaining the corresponding intersection of the linear fit with the baseline [49]. Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectra (DRIFTS) were taken in a Bruker Vertex 80 FTIR spectrometer using a MCT detector and running under the OPUS/IR software. Transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were recorded on a JEOL 2100F TEM/STEM microscope. Particle size distributions of the noble metal were obtained counting more than 250 particles in all cases. XPS data were recorded on 4 × 4 mm2 pellets, 0.5 mm thick, prepared by slightly pressing the powder materials which were outgassed in the prechamber of the instrument at room temperature up to a pressure < 2 × 10−5 Pa to remove chemisorbed water from their surfaces. XPS spectra were recorded with a PHI VersaProbe II Scanning XPS Microprobe with scanning monochromatic X-ray Al Kα radiation as the excitation source (200 µm area analysed, 52.8 W, 15 kV, 1486.6 eV), and a charge neutralizer. The pressure in the main chamber was < 2.0 × 10−6 Pa. High-resolution spectra were recorded at a given take-off angle of 44° by a multi-channel hemispherical electron analyser operating in the constant pass energy mode at 29.35 eV. Spectra were charge referenced with the C 1s of adventitious carbon at 284.8 eV and analyzed using PHI SmartSoft software and processed using MultiPak 9.3 package. Shirley-type background and Gauss–Lorentz curves were used to determine the binding energies. The energy scale was calibrated using Cu 2p 3/2, Ag 3d 5/2, and Au 4f 7/2 photoelectron lines at 932.7, 368.2, and 83.95 eV, respectively."
4,Photo-catalytic experimental and computational details,"2.3 Photo-catalytic experimental and computational details Gas-phase reaction was carried in a continuous flow annular photoreactor containing ca. 0.1–0.5 mg cm−2 of photocatalyst as a thin layer coating on a pyrex tube. The scheme of the reactor is shown in Fig. S1 of the Supporting information section. After degassing the line with Ar, the flow was settled down to 10 mL min−1 and stabilized before reaction. A x:y (v/v; x:y from 3:7 to 7:3) MeOH/H2O mixture was achieved with a carrier having saturated water content. Water was injected with a syringe pump and the corresponding methanol content using a saturator at controlled temperature. Photocatalytic experiments were carried out under UV-A light irradiation (Philips BLB F6T5; 6 W) or sunlight-type irradiation (Philips TL54-765; 6 W). In both cases, four fluorescent lamps symmetrically positioned outside the photo-reactor were used (see configuration at Supporting information section, Fig. S1 Section 1). Reaction rates for hydrogen production were evaluated under steady-state conditions, typically achieved after ca. 2 h from the irradiation starting. The concentration of the reactants was analyzed using an online gas chromatograph (Agilent GC 6890) equipped with HP-PLOT-Q/HP-Innowax columns (0.5/0.32 mm I.D. × 30 m) and thermal conductivity and flame ionization detectors. The analysis of the catalytic response to experimental variables was carried out though a Box–Behnken factorial design [50]. Three factors (water:methanol ratio, catalyst content at the film and illumination level) at three levels were used, as detailed in the Supporting information (Section 2). These are the most important experimental variables according to many studies [35,51–58]. Considering that two electrons are required to reduce two protons and thus to produce one H2 molecule, the Quantum Efficiency is calculated following IUPAC recommendations as Eq. (1), dividing the reaction rate (r: mol m−2 s−1) by the averaged superficial rate of photon absorption ( < e a , s > : Einstein m−2 s−1) [45]. Details of the calculation are presented in Section 3 (quantum efficiency) of the Supporting information file and fully described in Refs. [59, 60]. (1) ƞ q ( % ) = 100 × 2 xr < e a , s > To interpret on physico-chemical basis the photo-catalytic response of the solids we performed a kinetic analysis of the catalytic response compiled in Table S1. If the reactor operates under a kinetic control regime, the mass balance can be expressed as Eq. (2) [59]: (2) v z d C C H 3 OH d z = ± a r C C H 3 OH where r C H 3 OH and C C H 3 OH are the average reaction rate and concentration of methanol, respectively. Also, a , v z are the external catalytic surface area per unit volume and the axial velocity. The numerical solution of Eq. (2) requires one initial condition obtained from the measurement of the methanol inlet concentration. The reaction rate at Eq. (2) describing hydrogen photo-production is for the first time here analyzed. It is calculated using an intrinsic kinetic formalism that takes into account rigorously the effect of light. To this end, we utilized the reaction mechanism presented in Table S2, considering that alcohol reforming is a hole-related mechanism [1,45,60–62]. As detailed in the Supporting information section, the reaction rate follows Eq. (3). (3) r C H 3 OH = − α Sites K C H 3 OH C C H 3 OH 1 + K H 2 O C H 2 O + K C H 3 OH C C H 3 OH e a , s where Ci is the concentration of i species, Ki is the adsorption constant, e a , s is the local superficial rate of photon absorption, Sites are the adsorption sites for methanol, and α is a kinetic-type constant described in the Supporting information. The solving of the non-linear fitting problem which includes the differential Eq. (2) to model the reactor renders information about three types of parameters (gathered in Table S3 of the Supporting information) [46]. The first one (described in Eq. (S11)) corresponds to a ratio between the rate of hole species generation and the recombination rate. This parameter thus provides a measure of the hole species reaching the surface of the catalyst and able to interact with target molecules. The second one corresponds to the adsorption constant(s) of the reactant molecules and the third one is the number of adsorption sites at the surface of the catalysts. The two last parameters were independently analyzed using chemisorption experiments presented in Section 4 in the supporting section (see Table S3 of the Supporting information section for corresponding results)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization results,"3.1 Characterization results Fig. 1 displays the XRD patterns of the Pt/g-C3N4 reference and the Pt/xB-g-C3N4 samples. All patterns show the typical profile of the graphitic C3N4 layered structure, dominated by the interlayer-stacking (002) reflection. Additionally, the (100) reflection, related to the intralayer structural packing motif of tri-s-triazine units, is detected in all samples at around 13.1° [16,17,35]. The absence of significant changes in these two graphitic C3N4 XRD peaks can be noticed among samples. This suggests that the incorporation procedure of boron does not alter the (bare) support to a large degree. This is further corroborated by the morphological observables presented in Table 1. In particular, the BET area of the support is 16.9 m2 g−1 while those of the samples oscillate between 17.8 and 25.5 m2 g−1. So, a modest increase in surface area would occur and is likely attributable to a limited effect of boron. This mild effect of boron is mostly detectable in the moderate variation of the pore volume of the samples compared with the bare carbon nitride. In spite of it, the average pore size is in the 10–15 nm range for all samples (Table 1), indicating a limited differential effect in the adsorption of the reactants. In addition, in Fig. 1 the materials show additional XRD peaks about ca. 40°. The peaks ascribed to the fcc metallic Pt phase (JCPDS cad 87-0638) are marked with asterisks in Fig. 1. These peaks appear over the wavy background of the carbon nitride component and are rather broad, complicating their study. The full width at half maximum increases with the boron content of the materials. The analysis of the supported metallic phase of the catalysts has been completed using microscopy. Low and high magnified micrographs of the selected catalysts are presented in Fig. 2. All materials show a finely dispersed metallic phase homogeneously distributed over the typical laminar morphology of the support, the carbon nitride material. The particles have round, spherical shapes, the majority presenting in the micrographs the most probable (by energetic reasons) planes, e.g the (111) and (200) planes. A few agglomerations of platinum nanoparticles are however observed in the low magnification images. Analysis of platinum primary particle was carried out and the corresponding particle size distributions obtained are presented in Fig. S2 of the Supporting information. The average noble metal particle size takes a value of ca. 3.9 nm for the bare carbon nitride support and decreases rather slowly with the boron content of the solids, reaching a value of ca. 2.9 nm for the Pt/5B-g-C3N4 sample. So, a relatively modest increase in metal dispersion and metal surface area takes place in the series of samples with the growth of the boron content. The physico-chemical properties of the support were also analyzed using XPS. The C 1s and N 1s XPS regions are dominated by support contributions and results summarized, respectively, in Tables S4 and S5 of the Supporting information section. The C/N ratio goes from ca. 0.73 to 0.76 for all samples, rather close to the expected from the chemical composition of the support. Moreover, all samples show the same C 1s and N 1s XPS spectra without changes (within experimental error) in peak(s) position and intensity. As summarized in Tables S4 and S5 and thoroughly described in the literature, fitting of carbon and nitrogen species requires three (main) different components in each case [8,17,21,22,63,64]. Following the analysis carried out in these works, the C 1s XPS peak shows contributions from the CC signal (which, as well known, may contain a contribution for spurious entities besides that of the semiconductor) and two additional contributions located at higher binding energy and related to bridging carbons between aromatic moieties (C3 N) or at the aromatic rings (NCN). Similarly, the fitting of the N 1s XPS spectrum displayed out contributions from the above mentioned C3 N and NCN species as well as NH moieties. In these two (C, N) cases, the XPS results display rather small variations among the fresh samples, indicating similar chemical properties of the carbon nitride component in the materials (Tables S4 and S5). Note, on the other hand, that the quantity of B does not allow to detecting any B-N/B-C contribution in the corresponding N/C 1s XPS spectra. The rather similar N and C 1s spectra displayed by all samples (Fig. S3) confirm this point. Also, attempts to introduce the BN/BC contributions in the corresponding spectra were shown to lack statistically significance with respect to the result(s) here described according to an F-test. The XPS analysis of the support is completed with the study of the B 1s peak. Fig. 3 contains the corresponding XPS spectra of the Pt/xB-g-C3N4 catalysts. A constant binding energy of 191.9 eV is detected for all samples. This is between the boron oxides and hydroxides (above 193.0 V) and the hexagonal boron nitride (190.0 eV) [64]. In fact, the binding energy corresponds almost exactly with the Kawaguchi´s boron carbon nitride (192.0 eV), where boron is surrounded by 3 nitrogen atoms [65]. The clear binding energy differences between the possible local environments (containing N, C and also O) of boron in our samples indicates that this cation occupies carbon positions of the solid network, presumably forming (absence of XRD differences with the reference powder) a substitutionally disordered doped carbon nitride in all samples studied. The IR spectra (Fig. S4) were also measured but, similarly to XPS, they do not detect signals related to BN/BC bonds due to the limited presence of B (compared with C/N) as well as some heterogeneity in the local order around boron. This behavior has been reported before [66]. We note that the use of dicyandiamide to produce carbon nitride based materials allowed to introduce boron in the network in a higher quantity than other precursors, such as urea, likely favoring the mentioned heterogeneity at local order level. These alternative precursors typically lead to a (boron) content lower than 50% with respect to the maximum quantity here presented [67,68]. Finally, XPS was used to complete the microscopy study of the supported metallic phase. Fig. 4 displays plots of the Pt 4f peak region for all samples under study and the corresponding binding energy data are compiled in Table S6. The fitting of the spectra showed the presence of three Pt species: metallic Pt, PtO and Pt hydroxide [64]. According to Table S6, these platinum-containing species binding energies displayed reasonably similar values for all samples. The relatively small differences (ca. 0.2 eV) encountered throughout the series for all platinum chemical species could be justified, at least in the metallic phase, by the rather smooth primary particle size variation detected with TEM. These small differences may also indicate a (indirect) Pt-B interaction occurring in the doped carbon nitride powders, mainly originated by differences in the electronic density of the carbon nitride surface shell(s) in presence/absence of B. In agreement with the TEM results, the dominant presence of the metallic component in the platinum phase distribution can be deduced from the phase content plots presented in Fig. 5 (top panel, see data corresponding to fresh, initial samples). On the other hand, the parallel behavior of the two oxidized phases as the boron content grows (Fig. 5 top panel) through the series of samples would indicate that the minor oxidized phases correspond, likely, to a surface passivated shell of the metal core(s) and that the Pt-B interaction may favor the oxidized state of the noble metal. Both the (modest magnitude of the) Pt species XPS binding energy shift and the change of the surface Pt passivated layer point out to a certain electronic effect of B in the noble metal. The characterization of the samples was completed with the analysis of the optical properties using UV–visible spectroscopy. Fig. 6 shows the corresponding spectra of the samples. They are similar as the spectral shape is dominated by the carbon nitride component (the component dominating the molar content of the materials) and display an intensity decay at the band gap region of the semiconductor. Considering that graphitic carbon nitride is an indirect gap semiconductor [16,17] we calculated the band gap values presented in Table 1. They are all equal within experimental error, with an average value of 2.725 eV. We also note that the valence and conduction band positions display only a smooth variation along the samples here studied. As measured using (valence band) XPS, this comes from an upward shift (with boron content) of ca 0.1 eV of the valence band position (which goes from 1.61 eV for Pt/g-C3N4 to 1.52 eV for Pt/5B-g-C3N4, values vs. NHE) and the essentially constant position of the conduction band (according to the band gap values presented in Table 1)."
7,Photocatalytic hydrogen production,"3.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen production The reaction rate for hydrogen photocatalytic production is presented in Fig. 7 for the two illumination sources here utilized, UV and sunlight-type. As expected, UV values are ca. 1.7 times higher than the corresponding sunlight-type ones. The behavior of both (UV and sunlight-type) reaction rates throughout the series of samples indicates the important effect of boron in the functional properties of the solids. The lower boron quantity tested almost increases per 2 the reaction rates. The maximum reaction rate was achieved with the Pt/4B-g-C3N4 sample under all illumination conditions. With respect to the Pt/g-C3N4 reference, enhancement factors of 3.0 and 3.6 are obtained under UV and sunlight-type illumination conditions, respectively. The larger enhancement under sunlight can be noticed, indicating the higher profit of the visible region of the solar light. The reaction rate suffers a relatively important decrease after the maximum (sample Pt/5B-g-C3N4). A cycling experiment was carried out to demonstrate the stability of the best Pt/4B-g-C3N4 sample. Fig. S5 provides evidence of the essential lack of time evolution of the hydrogen photo-production during four cycles of reaction consisting on ca. 85 h of operation. In order to quantitatively analyze activity, we additionally provide the measurement of the true quantum efficiency according to the IUPAC rules [45]. The modification of the optical properties of the solids, particularly, in reflectance, alters however the behavior of the activity observable through the series when comparing the reaction rate and quantum efficiency (Fig. 7). Although both observables show that the maximum activity region corresponds to a boron content from 2 to 4 wt%, using quantum efficiency the maximum activity is observed for the Pt/2B-g-C3N4 sample. The different behavior of the reaction rate and quantum efficiency is attributable, in turn, to modest differences in the behavior of the reaction rate and the rate of photon absorption throughout the series of samples. As said, all such differences are however rather modest for samples containing a 2–4 wt% of boron. Larger differences are observed when comparing the Pt/2B-g-C3N4 enhancement ratio(s) with respect to the Pt/g-C3N4 reference (Fig. 7). Under UV and using quantum efficiency we measured a ratio of 2.0 and under sunlight-type a ratio of 2.3. These ratios can allow estimating the real UV and visible light enhancement ratios. Using the radiation flux spectral distribution of our lamp and of the 1.5AM solar standard [59] we estimated a visible enhancement ratio of 2.3. The analysis therefore quantitatively demonstrates that boron has a higher enhancement effect for the visible part of the solar spectrum and demonstrates its suitability for promoting the activity of carbon nitride and to build up catalysts for green and sustainable chemical processes. Moreover, the quantum efficiency values are higher than those obtained for Pt-titania (nanometric anatase) material under sunlight and similar (gas-phase) conditions [69]. This further corroborates the potential of boron-doped carbon nitride-based semiconductors for profiting from solar light."
8,Interpretation of the catalytic properties,"3.3 Interpretation of the catalytic properties In order to interpret the activity, we first analyzed the stability of the powders under reaction conditions. Figs. S6 and S7 include plots of, respectively, the XRD patterns and UV–visible spectra of the samples after reaction tests. No significant differences are encountered with the corresponding initial sample signals presented in Figs. 1 and 6. Jointly with the constancy of the morphology observables gathered together in Table 1 clearly indicates the stability of the carbon nitride network under reaction conditions. Some minor changes can be noticed using XPS for the C and N containing species for exclusively the Pt/5B-g-C3N4 sample (Tables S4 and S5). They can be rationalized as an increase in carbon residues at the surface (increasing the CC contribution in Table S4), which appears specific for this sample and may be detrimental for activity. Larger differences are however encountered in all samples for the boron doping species. Although there is no change in XPS binding energy, Fig. 3 shows a modest decrease in intensity and increase in full width at half maximum (in the B 1s XPS signal) for post-reaction samples. This could be interpreted as an increase in the disorder of the local environment of boron, a process with seems general in all catalysts. Still, there is no indication of the appearance of other chemical species than the substitutional boron at carbon position(s) of the carbon nitride. A thorough analysis of the platinum evolution under reaction conditions was also carried out using XPS. Relevant results are presented in Fig. 5. The first point is the noble metal dispersion. This is considered here using the Pt/N ratio (i.e. normalization of the Pt signal to account for differences in surface area for the samples, see Table 1) between the initial (fresh) and post-reaction samples. The bottom panel of Fig. 5 indicates the relatively minor effect suffered by the samples. The Pt/g-C3N4 reference as well as the Pt/xB-g-C3N4 samples provide an observable near 1, within experimental error in all cases. This indicates the stability of the noble metal phase size/dispersion under reaction conditions for all samples. Zero valent platinum goes from ca. 61 (Pt/5B-g-C3N4 sample) to 73% (Pt/g-C3N4 reference) in the initial samples and slightly decreases after reaction in a rather similar way (a slope close to 0.9 in Fig. 5 would indicate that all samples behave rather similarly) from ca. 57 (Pt/5B-g-C3N4 sample) to 70% (Pt/g-C3N4 reference). So, not only the dispersion of the noble metal but also the oxidation state is essentially stable under reaction conditions. We therefore conclude that all samples are reasonable stable under reaction conditions and that differences between samples can be tracked up from the initial state. Under this premise, we first analyzed the photoluminescence spectra of the samples. Fig. 8 has two panels corresponding to the photoluminescence spectra of the powders under UV and visible excitation. Under UV, the spectra show a single peak peaking at ca. 490 nm, with the typical asymmetric shape previously observed by many authors [15–17,30,35,37,60]. Samples essentially differ in the intensity of the signal. As the photoluminescence intensity is directly proportional to the recombination of charge after illumination, we can see a qualitative (inverse) correlation between the quantum efficiency parameter (Fig. 7) and the photoluminescence intensity (Fig. 8). This is more difficult to ascertain under visible illumination as the defect states present over the decay curve presented in Fig. 8 are rather weak. Still, it appears that the charge handling capability of the samples affect activity in our series of samples. To interpret photoactivity in rigorous bases, we performed the kinetic analysis (the first reported in the literature as far as we are aware) of the set of catalytic results presented in Table S1 and considering 15 different experiments per sample to assess the behavior of the catalysts as a function of the most important variables affecting activity: catalyst concentration, illumination intensity and methanol to water ratio. In Fig. 9 we compare the fitting results (e.g., methanol at the outlet of the reaction vs. the calculated one) for the Pt/g-C3N4 reference and the optimum Pt/2B-g-C3N4 sample. The fitting outcome is rather good (with a root mean square of less than 0.9%) for both samples, indicating that the model captures the behavior of the solid in response to the experimental variables. The numerical values for the parameters are summarized in Table S3 for both samples. Rather than their exact values a more informative result comes from the trends taking place from the sample showing optimum activity to the Pt/g-C3N4 reference. This analyzes quantitatively the effect on boron in several physico-chemical parameters with catalytic relevance. The plots at the bottom (panels C and D) of Fig. 9 provide a visual representation facilitating this comparison. Panel C provides evidence of the trade-off triggered by boron presence at carbon nitride in the different physico-chemical parameters. This is not a simple effect as the correlation plot between the Pt/g-C3N4 reference and the Pt/2B-g-C3N4 sample (Fig. 9C) displays points above and below the diagonal line. As described earlier in this contribution, the alpha parameter is a measure of the availability of charge carrier species at the surface of the solids. Our quantitative analysis indicates that boron increases this by ca 4.7 times (Fig. 9D). Boron also alters the adsorption properties of the solids. Measuring the adsorption constant of water and methanol the study provides evidence that boron only alters the second, which shows a decrease by ca. 1.8 times. Note that this variation affects in a complex way the reaction rate (a Langmuir type behavior as evidenced by Eq. (S10)). Finally, there is also a (relatively modest) effect in the total adsorption sites at the surface, decreasing by a factor of ca. 0.72 times. So, boron has multiple effects in the reaction by altering both the number and the adsorption properties of the surface sites with an important effect for methanol. In spite of such effect, the reaction rate is dominated by changes in the kinetic behavior of charge species reaching the surface and generating catalysis. In this context, we note that the photoluminescence measures the decrease in charge recombination but cannot provide any information about the ability of the survival charge to access the surface and to interact subsequently with the target molecules. A similar conclusion can be generalized to other typical techniques analyzing charge carrier behavior (photocurrent and others) as they cannot (or have been never applied) be carried out at reaction conditions concerning the simultaneous action of the light and the full reaction mixture in a broad range of experimental conditions (as here exemplified in Table S2). In summary, boron doping cannot be explained by a simple or main effect as its presence in the catalyst has effects in multiple physico-chemical parameters in turn influencing the functional properties of a g-C3N4 based material. Using the adequate Pt/g-C3N4 reference and a combined spectroscopic (photoluminescence) and kinetic study, we were able to provide a holistic view (not yet present in the literature) of the doping process taking place in B-containing carbon nitride materials. Boron does not affect positively or negatively the absorption of light of the system as band gap value(s) as well as valence and conduction band position(s) do not change significantly along the series of samples. It however alters the charge separation step under all (UV and visible) illumination conditions tested as demonstrated by photoluminescence. This is likely based in the effect of boron in the electron conductance and charge localization [68]. This would be the first positive impact on functional properties. Nevertheless, the analysis of the kinetic parameter renders a more general view of the boron effect on charge carrier handling. Boron not only decreases charge recombination but additionally favors the creation of hole-related species (the charge carrier kinetically relevant species) effectively attacking methanol. Note that this rationalizes the relatively limited catalytic impact of the Pt physico-chemical properties. More precisely, in presence of boron, the dispersion and average oxidation state of the noble metal nanoparticles change rather moderately (with respect to the Pt/g-C3N4 reference) and this may affect minimally electron capture and subsequent reaction steps. However, the kinetic study proofs that these reaction steps (commonly analyzed using spectroscopic techniques) are not kinetically relevant. The key role of the metal is here related to its contribution in charge separation as the combined photoluminescence/kinetic study demonstrates. Aside that, the study shows that boron affects negatively the functional properties by modestly decreasing both the total number of adsorption sites and the adsorption strength of the sacrificial methanol species at the surface of the material. Overall, the joint spectroscopic and kinetic analysis was able to uncover (and quantify numerically) the multifaceted role of boron as driver for an improved catalytic performance."
9,Conclusions,"In this work we synthesized a series of Pt promoted carbon nitride samples using boron as doping agent. This element is present in the catalytic powders in the 2–5 wt% interval. The characterization showed that boron is located at carbon positions of the support and does not alter significantly the main physico-chemical properties of the semiconductor. Pt is deposited over the support with a core (metal)- shell (oxide) structure and presenting a particle size that goes from a value of ca. 3.9 nm in the Pt/g-C3N4 reference to ca. 2.9 nm in the Pt/5B-g-C3N4 sample. The series of samples were tested in the photocatalytic gas-phase production of hydrogen using methanol as a sacrificial agent. As measured by the quantum efficiency, maximum activity under UV, visible and sunlight illumination are obtained for the Pt/2B-g-C3N4 sample. Presence of boron has positive effects on photoactivity under all illumination conditions tested and are quantified by factors from 2.0 (UV) to 2.5 (visible). These enhancement factors compete favorable with titania based materials. The physico-chemical analysis of the samples was used to interpret the catalytic effects induced by the boron presence. For the first time in the literature, a combination of spectroscopic and kinetic analyses was able to clarify from quantitative bases the multiple (catalytic) roles played by boron. Boron is nearly neutral (absence of significant changes) in respect to light absorption capability, negatively affects the surface properties of the catalysts, with alteration of the number of sites and adsorption strength (the latter implying a lower adsorption strength in the case of methanol), but critically increases the availability of charge carrier species reaching the surface of the catalyst (not only affecting charge recombination) and attacking the sacrificial molecules. This commands photoactivity and renders outstanding materials under sunlight, providing thus a good basis for the development of solar based catalysts based on carbon nitride as main semiconductor."
