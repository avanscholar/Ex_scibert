0,Introduction,"Pineapple waste is fundamentally composed of surplus pulp, peel, and cores. Pineapple waste is not considered attractive as an animal feed due to its high fiber content, high soluble carbohydrate and low protein content [1]. Nevertheless, the pineapple waste extract, i.e., the juice obtained after the pineapple waste has been squeezed, mainly contains sugars and organic acids that can be utilized as the substrates in the production of hydrogen, methane and ethanol. Accordingly, various production pathways have been explored for hydrogen and methane productions including water electrolysis (power-to-gas), photochemical processing, photo-catalytic processing, and photo-electrochemical processing, as well as biological methods including photo-fermentation and anaerobic dark-fermentation. There are multiple reasons for biofuels to be considered as relevant technologies by both developing and industrialized countries. Energy carriers such as hydrogen and methane have been suggested as good substitutes for fossil fuels [2]. Xia et al. [3] suggested that mixing hydrogen 10%–25% (v/v) into natural gas could increase the combustion performance in a natural gas powered engine. The flame initiation speed and flame propagation rate of hydrogen/methane mixtures could be improved significantly in the engine. The use of hydrogen-enriched compressed natural gas was suggested to greatly reduce noxious emissions, such as NOx and CO, in the engine. Hydrogen and methane mixture with a composition of 20% hydrogen and 80% methane by volume as a new fuel was coined as a new brand name Hythane [4]. In order to reach maximum hydrogen production, there was a requirement to provide suitable fermentation conditions, especially the environmental factors such as temperature, pH [5], nutrient addition [6,7], buffer, and substrate concentration [8]. The appropriate concentration of substrate could enhance bacterial growth and activity [9]. Biohydrogen is recognized to be an ideal bioenergy, because it has a high specific energy content, can be produced via carbohydrates-containing biomasses and various organic wastes [10]. As compared with conventional single-stage digestion, two-stage anaerobic digestion exhibited more advantages. Single-stage anaerobic digestion for methane production is commonly employed in municipal wastewater treatment factory. The hydrolysis and methanogenesis process occur within a reactor. By contrast, two-stage anaerobic digestion processes are capable to biologically separate these two process. A two- stage anaerobic digestion system comprises a hydrolysis reactor in which a better pH range (5.5–6.5) can be maintained for the growth of hydrolytic and acidic bacteria and a methanogenesis reactor in which a pH range (6.5–7.5) can be maintained for the maturation of methanogenic bacteria. Detachment two main groups of bacteria (hydrolytic bacteria and methanogenic bacteria) has a perspectivities to deter digester failure because of excessive acid accumulation, and decline the overall HRT of the system whereas maintaining a high methane content in the biogas [11]. The two-stage reactor system and observed complete acidification of glucose into Volatile Fatty Acids (VFAs), alcohols, and gasses like CO2 and H2 in the hydrolysis phase. They fed the effluent from the hydrolysis reactor to the methanogenesis reactor in which a 98% carbon conversion occurred and biogas composition generated was 84.3% CH4 and 15.7% CO2 [12]. Two-stage systems can recommence steady-stage performance after a disruption in half of the time requested the one-stage system [13]. Schievano et al. [14] reported that the supremacy of two-stage on traditional one-stage anaerobic digestion, in terms of overall energy recovery from biomass has often been demonstrated. The overall energy recovery resulted in remarkably higher (8–43%) for the two-stage in the huge majority of experimental conditions and never remarkably lower. These initial results should drive further research to better understand the conditions that can drive the two-stage Anaerobic Digestion (AD) to higher performance. Typically, hydrogen-producing bacteria prefer short retention time, because the main H2 producing bacteria, Clostridium sp., tend to produce VFAs with H2 at the exponential growth phase whereas they produce alcohols at the stationary growth phase[15]. With the respect to microbial community, short HRT is also preferred. The washout of propionic acid bacteria, which use H2 during their metabolism, was observed upon transition of the HRT from 18 to 12 h [16]. It is popularly held that short HRT prohibits methanogenic growth, due to the growth ratio of methanogens is much lower than that of H2-producing bacteria. The HRT ranges from 0.5 to 12 h is optimal conditions for efficient hydrogen production from the liquid-type substrate. Pakarinen et al., [17] claiming the hydrogen production is inversely related with increment in HRT. With decrement in HRT, organic loading rate increases and provide excess carbon content in the system which produces higher hydrogen. The restricting levels of HRT for CSTR treating wastewater have been extensively researched in the past, finding that HRT down to 4–6 days was feasible at thermophilic temperatures. More current studies have shown that HRT should not be lower than 10–15 days when treating the waste at mesophilic temperatures. Generally, HRT is kept somewhat higher than practicable to ensure a more stable process. High-rate reactors with recirculation of effluent can enhance HRT while lowering OLR, making it possible to dilute influent concentrations. Depend on different substrates where alternative HRT, methanogenic digestion at an HRT of 4.43 days, the COD removal achieved more than 97% for a mixture of acetic, propionic and butyric acids [18]. COD removal is normally below 20% at the first stage of two-stage anaerobic digestion which does not significantly reduce the organic content of the feed [19]. In addition, there is no set optimal substrate concentration for the fermentation of different substrate to generate hydrogen [20]. Several researches indicated that rising Organic Loading Rate (OLR) remarkably disqualify the hydrogen consuming bacteria like Propionic-acid bacteria and methanogenic bacteria. There is reported in a pilot plant fluidized bed reactor fed with gluten wastewater, increasing OLR from 6.7 to 13.4 kg COD/m3.d remarkable improvement in Hydrogen Production Rate (HPR) from 2.8 to 28.47 L/L-d, with reduction in propionic acid concentration from 12 to 7 g/L [21]. The remaining COD from the first stage (hydrolysis) can be reduced in a following second stage (methanogenesis) with the conversion of organic matter into CH4. The H2 fermentation stage can also be used as an independent H2 production unit but not as a precursor/ treatment for the methanogenic reactor [22]. The highest methane yield of 345.2 mL/g COD was attained at OLR of 2.5 kg COD/m3-d and a maximum COD removal of 81% from bagasse bioethanol fermentation residues (BEFR) [23]. Krishnan et al. [24] determined with OLR ranging from 4 to 20 kg COD/m3-d for CH4 production. A mixture gaseous fuel in a certain composition of hydrogen and methane is call hythane gas. Producing the biohydrogen and biomethane through a two-stage dark fermentation process is a novelty way to meet the optimization composition of hydrogen and methane in the biohythane gaseous fuel. Pineapple peel is usually discharged before or after bromelain is extracted. Both the discharges of pineapple peel in these two ways produce waste about 33% of the full fruit and lead to serious environmental pollution [25,26]. It’s easily seen that the biogas production of two-stage is higher than single-stage anaerobic digestion [14]. HRT was investigated due to it was an essential parameter on the biohythane production ratio and working stability of bioreactor. It has a direct effect on economical operation when the lab module scales up to the commercial system. The objective of this research is aimed to optimize the biohythane gaseous fuel production (hydrogen and methane productions) from the pineapple peel waste juice using two-stage of hydrogenesis and methanogenesis technology."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Substrate and inoculum,"2.1 Substrate and inoculum Pineapple peel waste in this study was collected from Taichung City, Taiwan. The characteristics of pineapple peel waste discarded from a market was analyzed by sorting pineapple peel waste to find its main characteristics and is illustrated in Table 1 . Pineapple peel waste was crushed into small pieces then extracted to juice. Pineapple peel waste juice was kept in three different sugar concentration: unregulated, 20 and 40 g/L and supplemented with inorganic ENDO nutrients. Two types of buffers were used during the experiment: medium A (sodium hydrogen carbonate, urea) and medium B (sodium hydrogen phosphate, ammonium phosphate monobasic hplc). To facilitate long storage time, the pineapple juice was kept in a storage tank at 5 °C during continuous feeding to the reactor. The hydrogenic inoculum was employed from the biohydrogen production digester of Chemical Engineering Department at Feng Chia University. The immobilized preparation method of immobilized anaerobic hydrogen-producing bacteria is a method for preparing a colloidal bacterium containing one of the Clostridium sp. and most of the powder having porosity into a colloid which can be coated with the cells. The methanogenic inoculum was obtained from the biogas digesters of the pig farm in Exceland Ltd. Without any pre-treatment directly into the methane reactor for cultivation. At the beginning, 3 L methanogenic inoculum was mixed 2 L hydrogen effluent in the 5 L methane production reactor. Two-stage fermentation process was designed to improve energy recovery and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal at a constant temperature of 37 °C. The first hydrogen production reactor was controlled at a constant pH 5.5. The effluent from the hydrogen production reactor was further fed to the methane production reactor without pH 7 controlled. From the statement, considering the availability of the aforementioned wastewaters and the sustainable energy sources, this research discusses data on bench-scale batch reactors to evaluate the potential of effluent for the generation of hydrogen and methane mixture sequential and energy recovery."
3,Experiment setup and process,"2.2 Experiment setup and process This two-stage continuous process consists of two continuously stirred anaerobic bioreactors (CSABR), the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1 . The continuously stirred anaerobic bioreactor for hydrogen production (CSABRH) was a cylindrical glass-made column with a working volume of 1.2 L. The reactor was equipped with a pH probe connected to a digital pH meter (pH KDP-3000) and the temperature of the CSABRH has operated a thermal water bath allowing for water recirculation from a thermostatically controlled reservoir through the reactor's water jacket during the entire digestion process and was kept constant at 37 °C. The reactor was continuously stirred at 250 rpm using motor stirrer (Corning PG410D), CSABRH was equipped with a feed inlet, a liquid sampling point, an effluent outlet that flew directly to the methane reactor. The continuously stirred anaerobic bioreactor for methane production (CSABRC) was made by a glass jar with an inner diameter of 20 cm and a height of 30 cm in a total working volume of 5 L. A digital thermometer and a water bath was used to control temperature of CSABRC reactor. The reactor was continuously mixed at 150 rpm using a magnetic stirrer (IKAC-MAG HS7), the inlet was connected to hydrogen reactor, a liquid sampling point, an effluent outlet, and a gas pipe connected to the gas measuring system containing a gas sampling port. Both reactors were used the same gas meter (Germany 10C302001) The reactor configurations were a CSABRH and CSABRC for the hydrogenesis and methanogenesis, respectively. Table 2 shows the detail conditions of the hydrogen and methane production reactors in this study. A CSABRH was implemented as a first stage biohydrogen production reactor. Substrate was stored in a tank placed in a refrigerator to maintain constant temperature at 5 °C and was fed to the reactor via a precise peristaltic pump (Longerpump BT100-2 J) that pumped continuously to the bottom of the CSABRH reactor, NaOH solution was controlled pH between 5.0 and 6.0 by automatically feeding. The system was operated at the same HRT until both of reactors reached a steady-state condition. HRT and total sugar had been changed into variety values to investigate the potential hydrogen production rate as well as hydrogen yield. Subsequently, the effluent from the CSABRH was fed to the CSABRC for methane production. During second stage, NaOH solution was also automatically controlled by 7.0 to ensure the bacteria community growing stable. The total volume of gasses produced during the experiment was measured by gas meter, and the gas composition was analyzed using a gas chromatograph. Liquid samples were frequently taken throughout the experiments for determining the concentration of organic acids using a high-performance liquid chromatography, COD, VFAs, and total sugar concentrations."
4,Analytical procedures,"2.3 Analytical procedures The raw pineapple after extracting to juice was dried into a precision oven (JA-72) at 90 °C a day then analyzed fiber (Cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and ash) to find out the pineapple fiber components. Biogas samples were taken daily from the gas sampling port of each reactor. The hydrogen, methane, nitrogen and carbon dioxide content of the gases was determined using a gas chromatography (personal GC-1000, China) equipped with a Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD) and a 0.5 m stainless steel column conducted gases. The hydrogen and methane volumes in the collected biogas were calculated by multiplying the biogas volume by its proportion of hydrogen or methane. The Hydrogen Production Rate (HPR) and Methane Production rate (MPR) were calculated by excel software. Hydrogen Yield (HY) was expressed in ratio of HPR and reactor volume with total CODr and HRT as well as methane yield. The effluents of total sugar concentration from two reactors were analyzed every day which measured by phenol (C6H6O) and anthrone (C14H10O) methods. COD was checked every single new substrate batch for the input and every day for the effluents. VFAs were analyzed by Gas chromatography (GC) 2014 (Shimadzu GC) linked to AOC-20i Auto injector High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). All the experiments done in triplicates to get the average values."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Hydraulic retention time,"3.1 Hydraulic retention time The hydrogenesis stage of a continuous operation aimed at further selection of H2-producing bacteria in the biomass by application of high HRT and low substrate concentration, which were stepwise lifted during the experiment. After reactor start-up, the initial HRT was set at 12 h for a period of 29 days. HRT was then decreased to 10, 8, and 4 h for a period of 50, 45, and 15 days, respectively, the process kept going until reaching steady-state conditions in the reactor. Keeping constant feedstock concentration and reducing HRT is an efficient strategy to eschew the substrate inhibition, washout of non-hydrogen producing bacteria, and growth of the stable hydrogen-producing microbial community in a continuous system [27]. Fig. 2 reveals that the hydrogen production rate and gas concentration in different HRT. The biogas produced from the hydrogen reactor consisted exclusively of hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide and was free of methane. Initially, the biogas production rate (mL/LR-d, based on the working volume of reactor) at HRT of 12 h was fluctuating with a mean value of 227.6 mL/LR-d containing 45.2% of hydrogen at the steady state (with the rest being mainly CO2). The HPR was fluctuation at the beginning of HRT 12 h, but the system recovered and adapted to the new conditions shortly. This is probably attributed to the fact that the microorganisms are facing a sudden stepwise increase of organic loading. The microbial population shifts taking place during the extended operation period because of the presence of various organic and inorganic materials in the feed inhibiting treatment performance. HRT was kept being decreased to 10, 8 h along with the increase of total sugar concentration from 20 to 40 g/L to investigate an appropriate HRT for this kind of microorganism. Hydrogen production rates increased from 227.6 to 572.5 mL/LR-d at HRT of 10 and 8 h, respectively. It demonstrated that HRTs were too long to the bacteria substrates consumption. With the decline of HRT to 4 h, hydrogen production rates increased up to 599.0 mL/LR-d with the highest hydrogen content of 66.8%. Hydrogen production yield is a good indicator of the microbial populations’ effectiveness for hydrogen production and represents the capability of microorganisms to convert carbohydrates into hydrogen gas. Table 3 shows the hydrogen and methane productions performance at different HRT under steady state conditions. It was show in Table 3, the average hydrogen production yield increased from 4.4 to 9.3 mL H2/g COD with HRT of varied from 12 to 8 h. The maximum hydrogen yield was achieved at HRT 8 h, while the hydrogen yield was decreased with the HRT decreasing from 8 to 4 h. This could be due to the fact that the higher organic loading rate resulted in the substrate inhibition therefore lower the conversion of the organic matter in the substrate. It has been widely reported that the hydrogen yield increased with decreasing HRT and will face a substrate inhibition in a very low HRT conditions depends on the different feeding substrate [17,28-30]. Fig. 3 shows the methane production rate and gas composition in the methane production reactor at different substrate concentration. Table 3 also shows the methane production rate, methane composition and methane yields at the steady-state in average. The influent of the methanogenic reactor was rich in VFAs, as anticipated due to the treatment of the wastewater mixture in the hydrogen reactor. The pH in the methanogenic reactor remained practically constant at 7 ± 0.2 for the whole process. The process was unstable at the beginning, the MPR and methane composition were 134.6 mL/LR-d and 54.6% when the operation conditions were substrate concertation of 45.8 g COD/L and HRT of 3 d, respectively. There MPR is quite low compared with 5 L working volume. This is probably due to the fact that the microorganisms need time to get accustomed with the experiment condition at very high VFAs and COD concentrations. So that the biomethane production rate fluctuated. The feeding substrate concentration decreased to 37.7 g COD/L, the stable biomethane production rate was observed at 174.6 mL/LR-d. The maximum methane production yield of 167.9 mL CH4/g COD was achieved while the composition of CH4 in the total biogas was 66.1%. The increment of the OLR from 31.57, 128.03, 164.87 and 328.78 kg COD/m3-d with a decrement of HRT had a significant influence on the increase of H2 content from 45.2, 34.0, 58.5 and 66.8%, respectively. As OLR lifted with reduction of HRT, gas production and H2 content increased from HRT 10 to 4 h. The most probable reason for this circumstance of H2 production could be attributed to the fact that un-favor hydrogen producing bacteria was washed-out as they face increment of organic loading flow rate while rate remained bacteria favor produce hydrogen. The complete free of methane in the first-stage bioreactor could be consequences of the most plausible reason is the fermentation condition under acidic condition in lower HRT which not suitable for methane production. Higher H2 production in lower HRT could be due to increased OLR in the system and activity of H2-producing bacteria which was inoculated at the beginning of reactor operation. In higher OLR, H2 producing bacteria receive a higher amount of decreasing equivalents and consequently generate a high amount of hydrogen per reactor volume [31]. The maximum of hydrogen production rate was 599.0 mL/LR-d with the highest hydrogen content of 66.8% with the organic loading rate lift to 328.78 kg COD/m3-d in HRT of 4 h. As the reactor is operated at a moderately low pH for dark fermentation process, the COD removal is not significant. COD removal is normally below 20%, which corresponds to average H2 production of 2.5 mol/mol glucose [19]. Fig. 4 illustrates hydrogen production yield and COD removal percentage of the hydrogen reactor. The COD removal rate was decreased when the HRT varied from 12 to 8 h and then increased with decreasing of HRT to 4 h. This could be due to counteracting effects between OLR and hydrogen producing bacteria density in the reactor. It was found that the higher CODr appeared at both of HRT of 12 and 4 h with value of 42.2 and 42.3%, respectively. At the beginning of HRT 12 h, the OLR was only 31.57 kg COD/m3-d which substrate was easy degradation. The OLR increased with the non-degraded portion of the substrate increased which resulted in the decreasing of CODr varied from HRT 12 to 8 h. However, the hydrogen producing bacteria grew up very well which resulted in CODr achieved a maximum value of 42.3% at HRT of 4 h with OLR of 328.78 kg COD/m3-d. The rate of total biogas production also showed a similar direction of the COD removal at the HRT of 4 h in the hydrogen production reactor and HRT of 3 d in the methane production reactor. The maximum total biogas production rate of 2.5 L/d was found at the same OLR of 328.78 kg COD/m3-d. It is known that hydraulic retention time for methane production is longer than hydrogen productions. The HRT for methane production is typically ranging from several days to several weeks. Fig. 5 shows the methane production from methanogenic reactor system with increment of OLR and HRT of 3 d. The CSABRC reactor was fed directly with the hydrogenogenic effluent from the CSABRH to produce methane. Methanogenic CSABRC was used for treating the acidified effluent from hydrogen production reactor operating at HRT of 8 h and OLR at 164.87, 328.78 kg COD/m3-d, total sugar at 40 g/L. Even with the changed of HRT from 8 to 4 h, the effluent quality fed in the methane production reactor were not significantly different as methanogenic reactor consumes VFAs. Methanogenic reactor system was operated at 3 d HRT for 50 days and steady-state condition was observed from 23 to 25 days. The reactor showed the fluctuation and increasing during 23 days of an operation then an efficiency and process stability to the rest days. The majority of biogas was methane and carbon dioxide. At first, hydrogen was detected up to 20% in methane reactor, but after 23 days, the hydrogen composition was found less 2%. Initially, the methane production rate was 141.9 mL/LR-d with methane content of 54.6% at the first 23–25 days. During operation in steady state conditions, methane content was found to be 66.1% with a Methane Yield (MY) of 174.6 mL CH4/g COD. The characteristics of methane production reactor at HRT of 3 d under steady state operation are also shown in Table 3. The pH of the effluent was kept being stable at 7, indicating a well-buffering reactor. The maximum of COD removal rate at the methane production reactor was found to be 42.7%. The COD removal rate was lower than the conventional biogas plant which operation under the HRT varied from 10 to 50 days [32]. However, this results show that a novel of biohythane production from pineapple peel waste juice in two-stage of continuously stirred anaerobic bioreactors at a high feeding that HRT of 4 h in the hydrogen production reactor and HRT of 3 d, where as a stable biomethane production in the methane production reactor by converting the high VFAs content effluent after the first stage of hydrogen production reactor."
7,Metabolites,"3.2 Metabolites In sequential methane production reactor, the acid characteristic contained in the effluents after the first stage of hydrogen production reactor could be increased the efficiency of a methane production. In this way, the metabolites of VFAs production was also obtained. The methane production experiment was started at the same time with HRT of 8 h and substrate concentration of 40 g total sugar/L of hydrogen production experiment. A methanogenic CSABRC was used for treating the acidified effluent from the hydrogen production reactor with HRT of 3 d. The HRT not only influenced the HPR but also significantly affected the production of Soluble Metabolite Products (SMPs). In this study, various kinds of SMPs were generated from the CSABRH in different concentrations depending on the HRT as shown in Table 4 . Acetic, butyric, and propionic and valeric acids were found to be main components in the effluent at every HRT. The concentration of butyric acid increased when HRT was decreased from 12 to 4 h, which correlated with an increase in HY. Butyric acid showed the trend as that the concentration of butyric acid increased with decreasing HRT. At the optimum HRT of 4 h, the concentration of butyric acid reached its highest concentration, roughly 12096.35 mg COD/L, more than 50% of the total SMPs (shown in Fig. 6 ), indicating a butyrate-type fermentation. Further decreasing the HRT to 4 h consequented in a reduction in butyric acid concentration, which correlated with a slight increase in HY. Consequently, the butyric acid concentration in the fermentation broth was a good indicator for the level of hydrogen production in this study. The general metabolic pathway for hydrogen production by C. butyricum was reported to be a butyrate type fermentation. Propionic and valeric acid was found lower in the reactor for all HRT tested, which shows hydrogen production was not inhibited by propionic acid, considered as hydrogen consumers. The VFA production was not significantly different in various OLR tested because the effect of VFA conversion is related to hydrolysis/solubilization rate [33]. Due to only one HRT condition so that it is not seen clearly the VFAs trend as well as the increment of methane production. Nualsri et al., [32] reported that the HRT was further decreased to 2 d on sugarcane syrup, biogas production sharply increased. At a HRT of 2 d, methane content in the biogas was decreased from 63.6 to 58.5%, the sludge flocculated and washed out of the reactor. Therefore, using an HRT of 2 d risked failure of the methanogenic reactor."
8,Overall system perfomance,"3.3 Overall system perfomance The continuous production of biohydrogen and biomethane from pineapple peel waste juice via an integrated system of CSABRH and CSABRC was successfully conducted at the first stage, for the second stage, due to a short time to investigate of operation. As shown by the stable gas production and sustained operation of CSABRH (more than 4 months) and CSABRC (50 days). The Anaerobic Digestion (AD) process is often limited by two major steps depending on the nature of the substrate, i.e. hydrolysis and methanogenesis. The former step can slow down the whole AD process, particularly for complex organic substrates containing a high particulate fraction (e.g. pineapple peel waste, food waste…), as it makes the substrate available to the microorganisms for further metabolism. The methanogenesis step can be the rate-limiting step when using soluble substrates. The present system seems to favour the kinetics of both steps, speeding-up the whole AD process. The pineapple peel waste juice was treated in a CSABRH via the dark fermentation process, producing biohydrogen and an organic rich liquid fraction (VFAs). The spent liquid fraction was further utilized in a methanogenic CSABRC, functioning on an anaerobic digestion system. The optimal operation of the CSABRH has a vital effect on the subsequent methanogenic step. A Substrate concentration of VFAs in the fermentation broth, leading to a low pH in the system. In addition, pineapple waste extract contains a high amount of short chain organic acids, which in turn means that the extract would have a low pH and a high acid concentration. A high acidic content in the substrate can cause adverse influences on hydrogen production. However, VFAs and copious organic acids contained in hydrogen effluent can be converted to methane by methanogenic bacteria. Maximum hydrogen and methane production rates of 599.0 and 174.6 mL/LR-d were obtained in hydrogenic and methanogenic reactor system respectively. The energy yield values were calculated based on result of optimum operating condition, i.e. 4 h HRT in hydrogenic reactor system and 3 days in methaneogenic reactor system. Total biogas and heating value production rates in total 6.2 L working volume were 2495.1 mL/d and 13.1 kcal/d, respectively. The input COD was 66.15 g/L, after the first stage, the total COD removal was 42.3% then continuing reducing 42.7% in the second stage, totally the two-stage anaerobic digestion CODr was 85.0% for the whole process. Pineapple wastewater could be easily implemented to new planned towns and smart cities. Decentralized sanitation and reuse concept, based on source separation approach fits well in sustainable development as it provides energy along with high degree of organic treatment. Based on the HY and MY values, the substrate inhibition occurred at the HRT from 8 to 4 h and the higher substrate concentration of 45.8 g COD/L. It means that the bioenergy production has a limitation when the HRT lower to the 4 h and substrate concentration of 45.8 g COD/L, respectively. Cho and Park [34] studied the two-stage anaerobic digester for CH4 production from food waste and their consequences presented that a high total VFA concentration (15 g/L) was accommodated in the effluent from the first stage. They also concluded that a high leading ratio and short HRT of the second stage (methanogenesis) can be reached by feeding the effluent from the first stage reactor. Successful implementation of the two-stage anaerobic digestion system from research recommends that methanogenesis could convert VFAs to CH4 more efficiently. Rózsenberszki et al. [35] proposed a 3-stage, optimized bioprocess cascade involving biohydrogen, biomethane productions followed by microbial fuel cell to further polish the effluent and recovery more energy. However, the capital cost for building up microbial fuel cell is more than the traditional aerobic digester when treating the same amount of wastewater. Therefore, the traditional aerobic digester is recommended for treating the rest of organic matter in the effluent of two-stage biohythane production system."
9,Conclusion,"The proposed integrated two-stage bioreactors process, comprised of a CSABRH and a CSABRC, showed promising results of producing biohydrogen and biomethane from pineapple peel waste for a short duration. The maximum hydrogen production yield was achieved 9.3 mL H2/g COD at HRT 8 h. This condition was recommended for higher biohydrogen production efficiency by the pineapple peel waste juice. However, the maximum of the hydrogen production rate was achieved when the OLR was at 328.78 kg COD/m3-d with HRT of 4 h. The hydrogen gas productivity of 599.0 mL/LR-d with hydrogen content of approximately 66.8%. In the methanogenic stage, the methane production yield was stable when the OLR in the hydrogen reactor was 328.78 kg COD/m3-d. The maximum CH4 content and CH4 production yield were 66.1%, 174.6 mL CH4/g COD, respectively. The overall COD removal efficiency of the two-stage process was found to be 85.0%. The two-stage anaerobic reactor system could be a promising method for achieving sustainable goals at under-developed and developing countries with economically affordable, environmentally sustainable and socially acceptable issues. Due to the hydrogen and methane bioreactors are individual separated, it was easy to adjust the different working volume and HRT in both of bioreactors. Therefore, no need to consider the purification in the two-stage biohythane production system to meet a certain gaseous fuels composition. As a consequence, two-stage of biohythane production system could be an economy way to generate a novel gaseous fuel from pineapple peel waste juice."
