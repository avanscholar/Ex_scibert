0,Introduction,"With the exploitation and use of transitional fossil fuels, the environmental pollution is becoming more and more serious. Building a renewable, environmentally friendly and affordable energy system has become one of the major scientific challenges [1]. Among them, the preparation of hydrogen by electrochemical hydrolysis is one of the simplest, clean and renewable methods for converting abundant matter in nature into high value products [2]. It has been found that electrocatalysts play a critical part in energy conversion and storage because they can effectively increase the rate, efficiency and selectivity of HER. The most efficient electrocatalysts for HER in commercially are Pt-based materials [4]. However, precious metal electrocatalysts are expensive and resource poor [5], which limited many clean energy technologies large scale application. Therefore, one of the grand challenges in generating hydrogen is development of advanced electrocatalysts that not only have excellent performance, but also have the practical value with low price. Over the past years, Ni-based materials have remained a very influential hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalyst [6]. Especially, the investigation of various nickel-based hydrogen evolution electrodes with high activity provided broad prospects for the reducing of the over-potential for the hydrogen evolution process [7]. In this regards, enormous efforts have been committed to develop nickel-based electrodes (Ni2P [8], Ni3S2 [9], Ni alloys [10], and C@NiO/Ni [11]). Xu Yunfei et al. [12] synthesized Ni/NiO/CoSe2 nanocomposites by immobilizing Ni/NiO nanoparticles on CoSe2 nanobelts. The performance of this material is significantly better than the precious metal benchmark [13]. However, the detailed study on the relationship between the crystal structure of the nickel-based hydrogen evolution electrode and its hydrogen evolution behavior continues. Because nickel or its compounds are easy subjected to agglomerate when they exist alone, researchers tried to disperse them on the carrier materials to prepare composite catalytic materials [14]. Due to the high conductivity, corrosion resistance and structural stability, GO (graphene oxide) has been widely studied as an effective conductive support in energy-related research. However, the stripped nanosheets are stacked again due to van der Waals forces [15] and electrostatic forces between the graphene sheets, which greatly limits its use in catalyst carriers and other applications. In order to solve the above problems, some heteroatoms was doped to achieve the functionalization of graphene nanosheets, which not only introducing some other properties, but also retaining the original properties of graphene [16]. In general, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus are often used as heteroatom doped on carbon materials, such as SN [17], CoN [18] and MoP/P-N [19]. Wang et al. produced defective Co, N and S co-doped 3D graphene materials with high HER dual-function electrocatalytic properties [18]. Zhao et al. fabricated nanostructured molybdenum phosphide supported on N, P double-doped carbon nanotubes regard as a catalyst for electrocatalytic HER, which exhibited superb catalytic activity in both acidic and alkaline solutions [20]. Single nitrogen, sulfur or phosphorus doping graphene have been studied a lot as an electrocatalyst, however, individually doped graphene-based materials do not satisfy commercial demands in terms of efficiency and performance [21]. In this paper, two types of nickel-based compounds (Ni/SPG and NiO/SPG) are designed via facile hydrothermal and alcohol-heating method. The small nano-sized Ni supported on SPG was successfully synthesized when ethylene glycol was used as a solvent sodium and sodium hydroxide as pH regulator. It may be attributed to that NiCl2 and NaOH exchange their ions to obtain Ni(OH)2, which was in-situ reduced by ethylene glycol to formation Ni/SPG. Surprisingly, the flake-like NiO/SPG was subsequently obtained when ethanol became the solvent and ammonia was used to adjust the pH. From the structural characterization of NiO/SPG, the sheet-like NiO is intercalation in the SPG and exhibits a three-dimensional sponge shape. Besides, the electrochemical performances of the as-prepared electrodes (Ni/SPG and NiO/SPG) a with typical structures and morphologies for the hydrogen evolution reaction were investigated by overpotential, AC impedance, and cyclic voltammetry."
1,Experimental section,
2,Reagents and apparatus,"2.1 Reagents and apparatus Materials were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China. Natural graphite powder (C) is a chemically pure reagent. The analytical reagents are concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4), absolute ethanol (CH3CH2OH), ethylene glycol ((CH2OH)2), phytic acid (C6H18O24P6), nickel chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O) and ammonia (NH4OH). Deionized water was used for solutions during the experiment."
3,Preparation of NiO/SPG and Ni/SPG,"2.2 Preparation of NiO/SPG and Ni/SPG The preparation process of the SPG composite is as follows: the GO deviated by the modified Hummers method [22] is dispersed in water, then 1 mL of phytic acid (PA) and 1 mL of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) are added to the solution, stirred uniformly, and transferred to a 50 mL PTFE-lined stainless steel high pressure reactor. The mixture was heated to 160 °C for 10 h and was naturally cooled to room temperature. The precipitate was collected and washed several times with deionized water and dried overnight at 60 °C. To prepare NiO/SPG, NiCl2·6H2O was uniformly dissolved in CH3CH2OH, then ammonia was dropwise added under stirring until the solution turned blue. The mixture was transferred to an autoclave and hydrothermally treated at 180 °C for 24 h. The obtained composite hydrogel was dried in an oven at 60 °C, named NiO/SPG. To prepare Ni/SPG, NiCl2·6H2O was uniformly dissolved in (CH2OH)2 and the pH of the solution was adjusted with NaOH. The latter process is the same as that of NiO/SPG. The final product was labeled Ni/SPG. Sample synthesis flow chart was shown in Fig. 1 ."
4,Material characterizations,"2.3 Material characterizations The morphology and microstructure of samples were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL-JEM-2010, Japan) and scanning electron microscope (SEM, S-4800, Hitachi, Japan) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). The structures of the prepared compounds were performed by Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Bruker D 8 Advance equipped with Cu-KR radiation (k = 1.5406 Å) scan. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was measured by a Model NIcolETiS 10 Fourier transform spectrometer (Thermo SCIENTIFIC Co., USA). The elemental distribution (XPS) was investigated on a multifunctional imaging electron spectrometer (PHI-5702, America). A CHI660DAutolab with a three-electrode cell was applied to electrochemical measurements at room temperature with 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 solution as electrolyte."
5,Preparation of working electrode,"2.4 Preparation of working electrode All electrochemical measurements were performed in Autolab (CHI 660D) with a three-electrode system. The platinum counter electrode and the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) at room temperature are reference electrodes, and the working electrode is a glassy carbon electrode containing the sample. Preparation steps for samples containing glassy carbon electrodes: accurately weigh 4 mg of each sample, separately dissolved in 1 mL of a mixed solution ethanol and water (1:3) and add an appropriate amount of Nafion solution, sonicated until the solution is completely dissolved. The working electrode was then prepared by precisely moving 10 μL of the sample to the center of the working electrode using a microsampler."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Structure characterization,"3.1 Structure characterization Fig. 2a shows the XRD spectra of GO, SPG, NiO, NiO/SPG and Ni/SPG. The 9.25° and 42.83° of GO in the figure are attribute to (001) and (111) crystal planes, respectively. When sulfur and phosphorus were doped to GO, a broad peak of carbon 002 appeared at 24.78°, indicating that sulfur and phosphorus were successfully doped into the GO [21]. The diffraction peaks at 37.25°, 43.27°, 62.86°, 75.39°, and 79.38° in NiO/SPG correspond to the (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) crystal planes of NiO phase, respectively, which indicate NiO is was successfully loaded on the surface of doped graphene. The Ni/SPG hybrid displays the peaks for Ni at 44.5°, 51.8° and 76.3° are assigned to the (111), (200) and (220) crystal planes, respectively, suggesting successful synthesis of nickel nanoparticles. No other diffraction peak was discovered in the two composites, which further illustrate that NiO and Ni have their good crystallinity. Fig. 2b depicts the FTIR spectrums of GO, SPG, NiO, NiO/SPG, and Ni/SPG. In the spectrum of GO, broad adsorption band at 3300–4000 cm−1 is the characteristic absorption of OH bending and stretching of hydroxyl groups attached on surface of the GO, the band at 1734 cm−1, 1621 cm−1, 1359 cm−1 and 1068 cm−1 is corresponding to the vibration of CO, CC, CO and COC, respectively. Compared with GO, CC transmittance peaks appear near 1220 cm−1 in SPG is significantly enhanced, and the intensity of OH peak weakened, which suggest that the oxidation groups of graphene surface are less during the process of hydrothermal sulfur and phosphorous doping progress. On the FTIR spectrum of NiO, except for the appearance of NiO peak around 650 cm−1, the absorption peaks of CO and CC were also observed in the vicinity of 1650 cm−1 and 1500 cm−1, respectively. After successful formation NiO/SPG, the peak position of NiO moves to the right at 480 cm−1, and the transmittance peaks of CC and CO become strong. Since the Ni loading does not form a chemical bond on the SPG, no other new peak positions appear. Raman spectroscopy provide the changes in surface structure of GO and SPG (Fig. 3 ). The peaks locate around 1342.4 cm−1 and 1585.7 cm−1 attribute to the D band (plane vibration of sp2 carbon atoms) and G band (sp3 carbon atoms of disordered graphite) of carbon-based materials, respectively. The intensity ratio (ID/IG) is a measure which is the domains between the disordered sp3 and ordered sp2 carbon. Among them, the ID/IG value of GO is 1.00, and after doping, the ID/IG value of the SPG increase to 1.21, which demonstrates the increased defects in the material and the successful doping of the material from the side [23]. In order to further determine the surface element composition and chemical state of the sample, the samples Ni/SPG and NiO/SPG were characterized further by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 4a shows the XPS survey spectrum of Ni/SPG and NiO/SPG samples. It can be seen from the figure that there are no impurities other than C 1s, O 1s, S 2p, P 2p, and Ni 2p. Fig. 4b depicts the C 1s high-resolution spectrum after Lorentzian-Gaussian fitting, showing binding energies at 284.8 eV, 286.3 eV, and 288.8 eV, respectively, where the strong absorption peak at 284.8 eV is attributable to CC, the peak at 286.3 eV is belong to CP, CO and CS according to the literature reported [24], while the absorption peak at 288.8 eV is attribute to CO. From the energy spectrum of O 1s in Fig. 4c, we can find that the CO and C-S-C absorption peaks appear at 528.5 eV and 530.4 eV, respectively, and the peak located at 529.3 eV is related to the epoxy groups of O 1s. Fig. 4d is an energy level diagram of P 2p [25], the peak at 133.3 eV and 138.4 eV is correspond to P-O-P and PO, respectively, while the peak at 135.5 eV and 136.5 eV is attributed to PC [26]. As shown in Fig. 4e, the characteristic peak at 167.4 eV ascribed to S 2p3/2, and the peak at 168.5 eV assigned to S 2p1/2 [27]. Fig. 4f is the XPS spectrum of Ni 2p of Ni/SPG. Both peaks at 861.9 eV and 873.8 eV correspond to Ni 2p1/2, and Ni 2p3/2 is observed at 880.0 eV, while the peaks of 855.5 eV and 866.7 eV are belong to the characteristic peak of Ni0 2p3/2, indicating the existence of Ni [28]. Fig. 4g is the XPS curve of Ni 2p of NiO/SPG, except for the Ni 2p3/2 characteristic peak at 857.1 eV was belonging to Ni 2p, the other peak positions are consistent with those in Ni/SPG [29,30]. All of these characterization results further clearly confirm that the successful synthesis of NiO/SPG and Ni/SPG catalysts. The morphologies of the samples we synthesized were observed in Fig. 5 . GO (Fig. 5a) has an irregular sheet-like structure with a slight wrinkle and a rough surface. However, the spacing between the sheets is too small, which is not conducive to the direct attachment of the material to its surface. After S and P doping (Fig. 5b), which also exhibits a sheet structure, but the layer doped graphene is curled to form more pleats and an overhead three-dimensional structure, providing a larger surface area. Furthermore, doping of S and P makes the layer structure of GO more obvious, and also increases the distance between the layers, which is more conducive to the nickel-based compound loading. Since the CC bond length in graphene is close to 0.142 nm, the bond lengths of the CS bond and the CP bond formed by S and P doping are about 0.178 nm and 0.187 nm, respectively. The doping of S and P, the complete structure of graphene was destroyed, which was the root cause of more defects and wrinkles [31,32]. TEM image shows SPG (Fig. 5c) is the characteristics of transparent ultra-thin film and the wrinkles are increased after doping. NiO (Fig. 5d) can be arranged orderly in a lamellar structure in the process of hydrothermal reaction, forming nanosheets smaller and uniform in size. After the NiO is loaded on SPG (Fig. 5e), the original three-dimensional crimping structure of SPG becomes a three-dimensional hollow structure, and NiO nanosheets adhere to the surface and inside of the hollow structure, which presents a hollow three-dimensional sponge shape releasing a larger surface area and more complete contact with the reactants. The intermediate or overlapping structure of the nanosheets increases the path of electron transfer and can reduce the resistance of electron transfer to a certain extent. TEM image of NiO/SPG (Fig. 5f) displays it is a large piece of stratified layer, which proves its spatial three-dimensional structure and NiO is well interspersed on the surface and inside of SPG. It is not difficult to observe that the NiO nanosheets are not stacked on the SPG, but are more dispersedly attached to the SPG sheet. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image exhibits clear lattice fringes with interplanar distances of 0.241 nm, corresponding to the (111) plane of NiO [33]. Surprisingly, at the same hydrothermal conditions, the nickel nanoparticles were synthesized by only changing the solvent and alkali source (Fig. 5g). Although the nanoparticles are partially stacked, the particle size is relatively uniform. After in situ grown on the surface of nitrogen phosphorus doped graphene, the Ni particle diameter became small (average particle diameter about 23.5 nm) comparing with Fig. 5h. From Fig. 5i we can find that Ni nanoparticles with uniform distribution appear on the surface of SPG, and the problem of nanoparticle stacking has also been successfully solved. The high-resolution TEM mapping of Ni/SPG can clearly observe the 0.204 nm interplanar spacing of Ni (111) [37]. Due to the small particle size of the nanoparticles, the specific surface area has also been greatly improved, thereby the catalytic activity sites of Ni-SPG is greatly increasing, so the electrochemical catalytic comprehensive performance can be effectively increased."
8,Electrochemical measurement,"3.2 Electrochemical measurement To evaluated the HER activities of each electrode material, we firstly explored cyclic voltammetry tests of all materials to compare their electrochemically active areas. Studies have shown that the electric double layer capacitance (Cdl) of conductive samples is usually proportional to its electrochemically active surface area and is one of the important factors affecting the electrocatalytic activity [34]. As shown in Fig. 6a, the order of electrochemical active area is Ni/SPG > NiO/SPG > SPG > Ni > NiO > GO. It indicated Ni/SPG hybrid could expose more catalytic activity sites in the process of hydrogen production than NiO/SPG. Compared to GO, SPG improved the specific active surface area is due to the doping sulfur and phosphorus to the graphene framework activates the neighboring carbon. As can be seen from Fig. 6b, the electrochemically active surface areas (ECSA) of Ni/SPG, NiO/SPG and SPG are 32.6, 13.8 and 4.1 m2/g, respectively [35]. According to the results of active area measurement, besides increasing the surface area of graphene, the effective active sites of nickel and nickel oxide also have a great influence on the active area. This fully demonstrates that the specific electrocatalytic effect of the material can be significantly improved by loading of Ni. In order to further study the kinetics of catalytic materials in the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution process, the electrochemical impedance (EIS) was further tested in an acidic environment. The obtained EIS data was simulated by ZView software, and the equivalent circuit diagram also obtained the charge transfer resistance (Rct). As displayed in Fig. 7a and b, the relative order of the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at 0.01–1000 Hz was 0.48 Ω (Ni/SPG) < 0.89 Ω (NiO/SPG) < 1.34 Ω (SPG) < 8.34 Ω (Ni) < (NiO) < (GO), suggesting the fastest electro-transmit reaction rate of Ni/SPG electrocatalyst for HER, which was less than the impedance of a portion of the carbon-based nickel compound listed in Table 1 . Among the samples listed in Table 1, some catalysts were synthesized via the hydrothermal process followed by high temperature calcination, which brought about the morphology of the material difficult to control. Our catalysts were synthesized by a facile two step hydrothermal process, which is simple, convenient and also safer. Although the Tafel slope was not the best, the initial overpotential and the electrochemical impedance of the materials were excellent. This indicates that the materials we synthesized have a bright future as a potential electrocatalyst for practical application. The effect of electrocatalytic activity of the samples were further confirmed by Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) with in −0.7–0 V voltage windows. From Fig. 7c, we observed the initial overpotentials (0.1 mA cm−2) of GO, SPG, NiO, Ni, NiO/GPS, and Ni/SPG are 375 mV, 182 mV, 140 mV, 112 mV, 57 mV, and 25 mV to achieve a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2, respectively. The overpotential (10 mA cm−2) of GO is almost infinite, indicating that GO has almost no catalytic activity. The overpotentials of SPG, NiO, Ni, NiO/GPS, and Ni/SPG are 394 mV, 374 mV, 320 mV, 235 mV, and 168 mV, respectively, at current density of 10 mA cm−2. It can also be seen that Ni/SPG electrocatalyst not only have a higher catalytic ability at the beginning of the reaction, but also have a remarkable catalytic performance during the reaction. Because the electronegativity of S is 2.58, which is slightly larger than the electronegativity of C (2.55), which can polarize the C surface charge of the neighbor. When the surface charge of C is polarized, the electronegativity is lowered, and the surface of the material is more likely to absorb the protons in the solution to balance [48,49]. The electronegativity of P is slightly smaller than the electronegativity of C, and its electronegativity is 2.19. The doping of P also causes the adjacent C surface charge to be polarized, the electronegativity is increased that OH– is easily attracted to the surface of the material. However, under acidic conditions, OH– is encapsulated by H3O+. Therefore, while attracting OH−, a large amount of H+ is also moved toward the vicinity of the polarized C [48]. The graphene surface doped with S and P changes the electron spin density distribution of C, and the surface of the material is enriched with a large amount of H3O+ to provide sufficient protons for the next reaction. Under acidic conditions, the hydrogen evolution reaction starts from the adsorption of protons on the surface of the catalyst, and the H3O+ in the solution reacts with the electrons, and the formed active hydrogen atom Hads is adsorbed on the active site of the catalyst (Volmer reaction). The electrons of the active hydrogen atom Hads and the non-paired d electrons in nickel can form the adsorption bond of atomic hydrogen (NiH), so the adsorption effect of metal nickel nanoparticles on hydrogen is obvious. Some d electrons in metals form metal bonds on dsp hybrid orbits, and some exist in the form of unpaired electrons. There are fewer d electrons in nickel oxide, the d component of metal bond is higher and the adsorption of NiH bond is weaker. Therefore, the catalytic activity of nickel oxide is lower than that of nickel metal nanoparticles [33]. Tafel slope determines the rate of the step of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. The difference in the Tafel slope in the figure reveals the effect of each sample on elementary step rate. The results (Fig. 7d) show that Ni/SPG and NiO/SPG showed the lowest Tafel slope of 79 mV decade−1 and 85 mV decade−1, respectively. Their activity is higher than that of Ni (112 mV decade−1), NiO (121 mV decade−1), SPG (198 mV decade−1) and GO (336 mV decade−1), which suggest that they have more favorable kinetics and are more active hydrogen evolution catalysts for acidic media among the prepared samples. Therefore, the S and P dopants, the interaction of Ni nanoparticles and the doped graphene all play significant roles in superior HER catalysis. Turnover frequency (TOF) is an important parameter for the intrinsic activity of the reaction catalyst. Here, the Ni/SPG of TOF at an overpotential of 100 mV was calculated that was 0.0051 s−1, and more TOF values were shown in Table 1. Our Ni/SPG has higher TOF values than some other reported Ni-based catalysts, such as PdCuNi (0.0003 s−1) [39] and Ni1.8Cu0.2-P/NF (0.0012 s−1) [10]. The Faraday efficiency (FE) of the water reduction of Ni/SPG was further evaluated by comparing the experimentally measured amount with the theoretically calculated H2. The amount of H2 increases during electrolysis, and the approximate difference between the measured value and the theoretical value indicates that FE is close to 100% (Fig. 8 ). Fig. 9a and d show the linear scan polarization curves for NiO/SPG and Ni/SPG at scan rates of 5, 10, 15, 25, 50 and 100 mV s−1, respectively. It can be observed from the figure that as the scanning rate increases, the initial overpotential and overpotential of the sample gradually increase, but still relatively low, indicating that NiO/SPG and Ni/SPG have excellent hydrogen evolution properties. The current density is varies greatly with the increase of sweep speed, probably due to the insufficient time of ion diffusion and electron transfer for high scan rates, which cause a decrease in the concentration of active hydrogen atoms on the surface of the electrode. Therefore, at higher scan rates, a larger voltage is required to increase the same current density. It would be more advantageous to have an electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction if it has a smaller Tafel slope, since a smaller Tafel slope can significantly increase the current density with the same overpotential increase. The Tafel slopes of NiO/SPG were 85.3, 87.3, 92.8, 93.2, 94.0 and 94.7 mV dec−1 at scan rates of 5, 10, 15, 25, 50 and 100 mV s−1, respectively, and the Tafel slopes of Ni/SPG were 78.6, 79.2, 79.8, 80.3, 80.9 and 82.0 mV dec−1. The graphs of Fig. 9c and f show the LSV curves of NiO/SPG and Ni/SPG measured before and after 5000 cycles of volt-ampere (CV) (scanning rate is 5 mV s−1). Compared with the initial test, the LSV curve after the 5000 cyclic tests of the two materials has only a slight negative shift, indicating that NiO/SPG and Ni/SPG exhibits prominent durability to withstand accelerated degradation. There is a slight decrease in the reduction of the current density, which may be attributed to the accumulation and release of hydrogen bubbles on the surface of the materials, and that's why it gets the serrate shape curve observed during the measurement of NiO/SPG and Ni/SPG. It was still observed that the change of Ni/SPG is still smaller than that of NiO/SPG, which indicates the stability of Ni/SPG is more favorable than that of NiO/SPG. As shown in Fig. 10 , the relative magnitude of the electrochemically active surface area of the electrode can be reflected in a certain extent by the slope of the linear regression equation. Therefore, comparing the slopes of these materials can be used to roughly determine the effective area of the electrodes. It can be seen that the curves dependent on the current and scan rate in this region is liner for all catalysts, which is consistent with the ECSA calculated from CV. In addition, electrodes made with Ni/SPG have the larger slope, indicating the larger electrochemically active surface area [50]. The XRD and SEM images after 5000 cycles of Ni/SPG were showed in Fig. 11 , it is not difficult to find that the diffraction peaks of Ni/SPG in XRD did not change significantly (Fig. 11a). Although nickel has a small amount of aggregation after 5000 cycles, the overall morphology of the composite has not changed significantly as seen from Fig. 11b. NiO/SPG and Ni/SPG show excellent stability both the material itself and the electrocatalytic performance after cyclic testing, which shows that the material has a very bright prospect in practical use. The excellent HER properties of Ni/SPG electrocatalysts can be attributed to: First, after the doping of S and P into graphene, the surface structure of graphene was changed, formed more defects and wrinkles. Which not only increase in catalytic performance but also increase the conducive between graphene to metals or metal oxides. Secondly, the electrons of the active hydrogen atom Hads and the unpaired d electrons in nickel can form an adsorption bond of atomic hydrogen (NiH), in which process the Hads were continuously consumed, and at the same time a large amount of Hads accumulate on the surface of the materials, which is beneficial to the improvement of electrocatalytic activity of Ni/SPG."
9,Summary,"In short, Ni/SPG and NiO/SPG hybrids were successfully synthesized by simple via facile hydrothermal and alcohol-heating method. SEM and TEM diagrams showed that NiO nanosheets were lamellar dispersed in three-dimensional doped graphene presenting a three-dimensional sponge and Ni nanoparticles were distributed on SPG. The as-prepared two hybrids were found to have good catalytic activity of HER under the condition of 0.5 mol/L H2SO4. Nevertheless, the Ni/SPG hybrids demonstrate remarkable HER activity of low initial potential (13 mV) and excellent Tafel slope (79 mV decade−1) than NiO/SPG due to nickel nanoparticles exposing more active edges during electrocatalytic process, which suggest that this low cost and highly efficient nanocomposites can be a promising candidate for large-scale hydrogen production by electrolyzing water."
