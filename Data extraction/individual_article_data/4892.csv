1,Importance of sugar conversion in biorefinery,"1.1 Importance of sugar conversion in biorefinery Biomass is a reproducible carbonaceous feedstock, which could be pyrolyzed to produce bio-oil that serves as a feedstock for the production of chemicals and bio-fuels [1–3]. The sugars such as levoglucosan and the furans such as furfural and 5-hydroxyfurfural are important fractions of bio-oil, which are also important products or intermediates from the hydrolysis of biomass [4,5]. For example, the hydrolysis of the cellulose in biomass produces C6 sugars like glucose, while the hydrolysis of hemicellulose produces both C6 sugars like galactose and C5 sugars like xylose [6–10]. Sugars are carbohydrates that have multiple hydroxyl groups and a carbonyl functionality, which could be further converted, via acid catalysis, to furfural [11–15], 5-hydroxylfurfural (HMF) [16–21], and levulinic acid [22–26]. Furfural and HMF are furans having a heterocyclic five-membered ring with four carbon and one oxygen atoms. The furans and levulinic acid are the platform chemicals for manufacturing other value-added chemicals [27–31]. In the process of converting various sugars from the hydrolysis of biomass or from bio-oil into value-added chemicals through acid catalysis, the most challenging issue is the polymerization of the sugars and their intermediates. Sugars in their chain form contain a carbonyl group and multiple hydroxyl groups, which are highly reactive towards polymerization under acidic conditions [32–35]. The carbonyl group in the chain form and/or the hemiacetal group in the cyclic form are the reactive centers in the sugar structures. Furthermore, the dehydration of the hydroxyl groups in sugars also generates the reactive intermediates with the conjugated π-bonds structures [36–39]. The polymerization of sugars and their intermediates would form polymeric structures that are different from the natural polymers in biomass, which are also termed as humins [40–44], leading to the consumption of the sugar feedstock and the reduction in the yields of the target products. More importantly, when polymers form on the catalyst surface, the catalyst might be rapidly deactivated. This hinders the commercialization of the various acid-catalyzed processes."
2,Polymerization – a major consideration in biorefinery,"1.2 Polymerization – a major consideration in biorefinery Different strategies such as employing different reaction medias [45–50], different catalysts [51–54], and optimizing the operating conditions [55–57] have been employed to tackle the polymerization of sugars and furans during the acid-catalyzed conversion or during esterification of bio-oil. In essence, these strategies aim to block the routes for the reaction steps towards polymerization, i.e. to modify the reaction pathways of the sugars/furans in order to minimize the occurrence of the undesirable polymerization reactions. For the acid catalyzed conversion of sugars or furans, various types of catalysts such as mineral acids [58–61], organic acids [62,63], polymers [64,65], metal salts [66–69], zeolites [70–75], cation-exchange resins [76–80] and sulfonated carbonaceous solids [81–85] have been developed or tested. They show distinct catalytic behaviors in influencing the conversion of sugars or furans. In addition, the effects of reaction media on the conversion of sugars/furans have also been intensively investigated, including water [86–89], dimethyl sulfoxide [90–93], tetrahydrofuran [94–97], methyl isobutyl ketone [98–101], N,N-dimethylacetamide [102–105] and ionic liquids [106–111], again aiming to suppress the unnecessary polymerization reactions. The development of methods for suppressing the polymerization of sugars/furans is of importance for achieving the high selectivity during acid catalysis, bridging the gap between biomass and the value-added chemicals. Unless the formation of polymers on surface of catalysts is minimized or practically eliminated, the acid-catalyzed process may never be commercialized. The importance of minimizing the formation of polymers has promoted global R & D effort on this topic. There have been several reviews about the development of acid catalysts, the topic of which were the evolution of biomass/sugars/furans [112–114]. Besides, the influence of reaction medium on the conversion of biomass or the derivatives have also been reviewed [115–117]. However, these reviews have not provided a specific overview of various methods reported in the literature for the selective conversion of sugar or furan to inhibit the polymerization of sugars/furans reported in the literature for the selective conversion of sugars/furans. Thus, in this review, we focus particularly on the suppression of the polymerization of both sugars and furans, which will have a biased focus on our own research work conducted in Fuels and Energy Technology Institute, Curtin University. The polymerization of furans is also included in this review as they are important intermediate products from sugars. Alcohols like methanol or ethanol are more volatile than water, and thus it is easier to separate them from the target products. Their effectiveness for suppressing the polymerization of sugars/furans has been confirmed in previous studies [118,119]. Thus, this review will focus mainly on the progress in understanding the impacts of alcohols on the polymerization of the reaction intermediates formed from sugars/furans. Specifically, the reaction pathways of levoglucosan, glucose, xylose, furfural, HMF, furfuryl alcohol, furan and other biomass-derived mono sugars or sugar oligomers in alcohols and in water will be focused. Special attention will also be paid to the fundamental mechanism for suppressing the polyreaction of the sugars, furans and other reaction intermediates in the acid-catalyzed conversion process. Moreover, it should be noted that we have conducted a mini-review of the reaction network during the enhancing of bio-oil catalyzed by acid in alcohols [120]. That mini-review mainly focused on the reaction mechanism of the main ingredient of bio-oil and the mechanism for the deactivation of the acid catalysts under the conditions of esterification of bio-oil. The reaction pathways of the sugar oligomers conversion from bio-oil to mono sugars were discussed while the polymerization of sugars/furans were only briefly mentioned [120]. A dedicated review is thus required to understand the progress in understanding the characteristics for the polymerization of sugars/furans and the methods developed for suppressing their polymerization. This review also provides the useful information for understanding the reaction behaviors of the sugar monomers and the furans in upgrading of bio-oil. Sugars and furans are important fractions in bio-oil and their conversion affect the viscosity, thermal stability, etc of bio-oil. Furthermore, since sugars and furans are very reactive to degrade to generate some rather reactive reaction intermediates, they hence could polymerize themselves, but also might cross-polymerize with other components of bio-oil. Especially, the understanding of the polymerization behaviors of sugars and furans in water and in alcohol medium has special importance. This is because water is a major fraction of bio-oil produced from almost all the lignocellulosic biomass, and water in some circumstance (i.e. heating of bio-oil during upgrading) plays the roles as the reaction medium for the conversion of other organics in bio-oil including sugars and furans. In addition, alcohol became the main reaction medium during the pretreatment of bio-oil via esterification. Thus, it is of importance for revisiting the conversion of sugars and furans in the reaction medium such as water, alcohols and other solvents in the context of upgrading of bio-oil."
3,Reaction networks during the acid-catalysed conversion of sugars/furan model compounds,
4,Polymerization of C6 sugars in water and methanol,"2.1 Polymerization of C6 sugars in water and methanol Among the varied methods for upgrading of bio-oil, esterification, in which acid catalyst is generally employed, is an important one with the main purpose for converting corrosive carboxylic acids into the neutral esters. However, under the condition of esterification, the sugars including levoglucosan also can also be converted, and thus it is of significance for investigating the reaction behaviors of the sugars in bio-oil. Since levoglucosan is generally the most abundant sugar monomer in bio-oil [118], its conversion under the condition of esterification, which employs acid catalyst and alcohol-rich medium, is thus discussed first. The acid-catalyzed conversion of levoglucosan in the water-rich medium and in the methanol-rich medium, which simulated the conditions of the direct heating of bio-oil and the esterification of bio-oil, shows that levoglucosan underwent different reaction routes in the different reaction media (Fig. 1 ) [118]. In the water-rich medium, levoglucosan could be converted into levulinic acid via the formation of glucose and HMF as the main intermediates, during which, however, polymerization become dominant to produce polymers as the main products. In the methanol-rich medium, instead of glucose and HMF, methyl glucopyranosides and the acetal/ether of HMF are produced. Meanwhile, the polymerization reactions are effectively suppressed. The reaction intermediates for the conversion of levoglucosan in the water-rich medium and in the methanol-rich medium are different in terms of their main functionalities. Some of the functionalities such as the C1 hydroxyl group in glucose and the hydroxyl group and the aldehyde group in HMF react with methanol, forming acetals or ethers. Converting glucose to methyl glucopyranosides and the HMF to its ether/acetal could protect the reactive functional groups and stabilizes the reactive intermediates. In the water-rich medium under the acidic conditions, levoglucosan could hydrolyze to form glucose. Glucose is reactive towards polymerization reactions as it contains the reactive C1 hydroxyl group [118]. The integration of the C1 hydroxyl group with a proton and the release of one molecule of H2O would form a carbocation. The results show that the carbocation would be very reactive as it could react with other sugars to form sugar oligomers or cross-polymerize with HMF. Nevertheless, via the conversion of glucose to methyl glucopyranosides, the reactive C1 hydroxyl group, which is considered as a reactive center for the polymerization of sugars [118], could be consumed in the methanol-rich medium so that the polymerization reactions otherwise initiated from the C1 hydroxyl group could be suppressed. This is because the sugar molecules are surrounded with methanol molecule. Once the carbocation is formed, it could readily react with methanol to form methyl glucopyranosides as methanol molecule is small enough to avoid the steric hindrance while reactive enough to integrate with the carbocation. Thus, the polymerization of the sugars could be inhibited. The yields of levulinate esters thus could be significantly enhanced. Levulinic esters contain multiple functionalities, which are the platform chemicals for the synthesis of other value-added chemicals."
5,Polymerization of C6 sugar in various solvents,"2.2 Polymerization of C6 sugar in various solvents The existing results about the conversion of the C6 sugars in water and in alcohols clearly indicated that the use of methanol or water as the reaction medium substantially affect the tendencies of the sugars or the furans towards polymerization [118,121]. The reaction behaviors of the anhydrous sugar, levoglucosan, in various reaction media such as alcohols, acetone, N, N-dimethyl formamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, chloroform, water and toluene have been explored [122]. The results show that the different reaction media substantially affect the formation of the insoluble polymers. The alcohols with small molecular sizes such as ethanol and 1-propanol could effectively suppress the polymerization reactions. The capability of the higher alcohols such as 2-octanol for suppressing the polymerization reactions. In the alcohols with single hydroxyl group, the size of the conjugated π-bond structures in the soluble polymer tends to grow bigger. Nevertheless, with ethylene glycol as the reaction medium, the growth of the conjugated π-bond structures has been confined. This is because ethylene glycol has two hydroxyl groups in the molecule, which could link with such functionalities as the aldehyde in the soluble polymer, preventing the further conversion of the soluble polymer to the insoluble ones. With chloroform, acetone or their mixture as the reaction media, the amount of polymer is very significant. Chloroform is an aprotic solvent and its polarity is much less than that of water. As a result, levoglucosan has distinct dispersion mode in chloroform and in water. Levoglucosan has a very limited solubility in chloroform, but it has been found that levoglucosan dissolved not in the solvent, but inside the Amberlyst 70 catalyst. Amberlyst 70, a solid acidic resin catalyst containing more than 50% of water in the wet form of the catalyst. The water inside the pores of the catalyst dissolves levoglucosan, and levoglucosan could thus have a close contact with the acidic sites inside the pores of the catalyst. Nevertheless, the confinement of majority of levoglucosan inside the pores also creates the opportunities for them to polymerize, leading to the high yields of the insoluble polymer. In comparison, in water, levoglucosan is well dissolved and dispersed. Therefore, the chances for their polymerization is reduced. Similar phenomenon is also observed in the conversion of levoglucosan in toluene with the wet or dry form of Amberlyst 70 [123]. In the aprotic solvent, levoglucosan is mainly dissolved inside the pores of Amberlyst 70 in the wet form, but could not be dissolved in the pores of Amberlyst 70 with the dry form. The results show that, over the dried Amberlyst 70, a significant amount of insoluble polymer could be formed, as is shown in Fig. 2 . In acetone, the amount of polymer formed is also significant, which, however, does not caused by the dispersion of levoglucosan inside the catalyst but due to the high reactivity of acetone towards polymerization. Acetone has a carbonyl functionality and multiple ɑ-H, making the molecule very reactive towards polymerization reactions. The results show that, via various intermolecular condensation reactions, the acetone molecule could aggregate and condense to form heavier ketones and aromatic hydrocarbons. Acetone could also integrate with the hydroxyl groups of the sugars to form acetals or reacted with the furans or other intermediates from sugars to form polymers. The other solvent, such as N, N-dimethyl formamide could not react with levoglucosan but react with the acid catalyst, resulting in a instant inactivation of the solid acid resin catalyst upon mixing N, N-dimethyl formamide with Amberlyst 70. DMSO is also an aprotic solvent and it could react with the reaction intermediates, and modified the reaction network. For example, 5-[(methylthio)methyl]-2-furancarboxaldehyde could be formed from the reaction between HMF and the degradation products from DMSO in the circumstances of acidic conditions. More importantly, the yields of HMF in DMSO is much higher than that in water, which is possibly due to the reduced acidity in reaction medium. DMSO is not a protic solvent for the effective transfer of protons."
6,Polymerization of C5 sugars and their derivatives,"2.3 Polymerization of C5 sugars and their derivatives 2.3.1 Polymerization of xylose in water and methanol The reaction pathways of xylose, the representative C5 sugar derived from hydrolysis of hemicelluloses, in methanol and in water are shown in Fig. 1 [124]. In methanol and at a lower reaction temperature (i.e. 130 °C), xylose is mainly converted into methyl xylopyranosides or methyl xylofuranosides, which further dehydrated to furfural or 2-(dimethoxymethyl) furan at the higher temperatures (i.e. 150 °C) [124]. The yield of the polymer at 150 °C is much more significant in the water-rich medium than in the methanol-rich medium (ca. 16% versus 3%). The conversion of xylose into methyl xylosides in methanol might suppress the polymerization of xylose or furfural. This is because, in methanol, methyl xylosides could not form d-xylobiose, a sugar oligomer, via the condensation between two molecules of xylose, while, in water, d-xylobiose is formed from the condensation of xylose. If the reaction temperature is further increased to 170 °C, xylose and furfural mainly polymerized whether in water or in methanol. Methanol could not suppress the polymerization of either xylose or furfural with the extended of reaction time at the high reaction temperature. Furfural has a very high tendency towards polymerization [125,126]. The results show that, although the furfural is partially converted into 2-(dimethoxymethyl)-furan in methanol, the reaction equilibrium between furfural and 2-(dimethoxymethyl)-furan shifted to the furfural side when furfural was consumed via the polymerization. 2-(dimethoxymethyl)-furan is thus converted back into furfural, which further polymerized. Reaction temperature remarkably affect the tendency of xylose/furfural towards polymerization. Thus, during the acid treatment of bio-oil in alcohols, the reaction conditions need to be carefully adjusted to minimize the polymerization from furfural, xylose and other C5 sugars. Methanol has drastically different impacts on the polymerization of C5 sugars and C6 sugars during the acid-catalyzed conversions. This is mainly because levulinic acid/esters are stable under the experimental conditions employed. In comparison, for the hydrolysis of the C5 sugars, the furfural produced shows a high tendency towards polymerization under the acidic conditions, especially at high reaction temperatures [127,128]. Although the aldehyde functionality of furfural could be protected via the acetalization, there exists a reaction equilibrium between the acetal of furfural and furfural. As mentioned, the consumption of furfural towards polymerization consumed the acetal of furfural. With the prolonged reaction time especially under high reaction temperature, polymer is formed as the main product whether using methanol or water as the reaction medium for the acid-catalyzed conversion of C5 sugars. 2.3.2 Polymerization of C5 sugars in various solvents The acid catalytic transformation of xylose in twenty commonly used solvents with distinct functionalities and polarities have been explored [129]. The properties of the solvent and the yields of furfural are shown in Fig. 3 . DMSO, methyl formate, THF, 2-butanol and guaiacol are the preferred solvents for the production of furfural in terms of the yields. The conversion of xylose in DMSO is relatively slow, possibly due to the higher pH value in the reaction medium. In addition, furfural could also be well preserved in DMSO. Methyl formate is a preferred reaction medium for the transformation of xylose into furfural, due to the fact that methyl formate has a very low boiling point and can be easily separated with furfural. The other solvents such as cyclopentanone, hydroxyl acetone or furan are too reactive, which could either react with xylose or furfural, reducing the yields of furfural in the reaction medium. The results show that, hydroxyl acetone, like acetone, could react via the intermolecular reactions, forming the heavier but reactive organics retaining the carbonyl functionality. Furfural could also react with hydroxyl acetone to condense. Cyclopentanone could also react themselves or react with furfural, which diminishes the formation of furfural. Other solvents such as iso-propanol affect the formation of furfural via the catalytic hydrogen transfer reactions. The furfural formed is reduced to furfuryl alcohol that is further converted to the levulinic esters under the acidic conditions. 2.3.3 Polymerization of xylose during the conversion to levulinic acid/esters via acid catalysis or hydrogenation Methanol as the reaction medium could not only suppress the further polymerization of sugars, but also could protect the reactive functionalities and prevent the further hydrogenation of sugars. One typical example is the one-pot conversion of hemicellulose-derived xylose to levulinic acid/ester via the acid catalysis coupled with hydrogenation [130]. The conversion of C5 sugars to levulinic acid/esters is of importance. This is because the hydrolysis of the C5 and C6 sugars produce different products (i.e. furfural versus levulinic acid). Further separation of these two products would be required. If both cellulose and hemicellulose could be converted to the same products, levulinic acid or methyl levulinate, the yields of levulinic acid/ester would be much higher than that from cellulose alone. The concept is demonstrated in Fig. 4 . Basically, four steps are involved in the conversion of xylose to levulinic acid/ester. The first step is the conversion of xylose into methyl xylofuranosides or xylopyronosides via acid catalysis. The second step is the dehydration of the methyl xylosides to form furfural. In the third step, the hydrogenation of furfural produces furfuryl alcohol, and, in the last step via acid catalysis, furfuryl alcohol is converted to levulinic acid/ester. Methanol is used as the reaction medium to protect the carbonyl functionality in xylose to avoid the hydrogenation of xylose to xylitol in the presence of the high-pressure hydrogen and a hydrogenation catalyst. The experiment using water as the reaction medium has confirmed the hypothesis. The results show that, in water medium, xylose is firstly converted to xylitol. Consequently, the further conversion to levulinic acid/ester would be impossible. Methanol as the reaction medium could also inhibit the polymerization reactions to a certain extent, as the dehydration of xylose and the conversion of furfural in the existence of an acid catalyst could be involved, as shown in Fig. 5 . Nevertheless, the yields of levulinic acid/ester are not high, which is around 25%, independent of the starting reactants. This is mainly due to the occurrence of the deep hydrogenation reactions. The results show that, not only the aldehyde group in furfural, but also the furan ring in furfural or in furfuryl alcohol could also be hydrogenated. Furthermore, even the products, levulinic acid/ester, could be hydrogenated, leading to the diminished production of levulinic acid/ester, as shown in Fig. 6 . However, methanol as the reaction medium, could do almost nothing to prevent the deep hydrogenation reactions."
7,Polymerization of furans in water and methanol,"2.4 Polymerization of furans in water and methanol 2.4.1 Polymerization of HMF The furans are important platform chemicals for the production of other value-added chemicals [132–136]. Some furans such as furfural and HMF are directly produced from the dehydration of sugars [137–139], while others such as furfuryl alcohol are produced from the hydrogenation of furfural [140–143]. The use of methanol or water as the reaction media also remarkably impacts the tendencies of the furans towards polymerization [144]. It has been found that the different reaction media make a drastic difference in terms of the selectivities towards levulinic acid/esters from furfuryl alcohol, as is shown in Fig. 7 . With either methanol or ethanol as the reaction medium, the yields of the corresponding levulinic esters reach ca. 90%, while in water medium the yields of levulinic acid is very low (ca. 11%). The characterization with UV florescence spectroscopy indicates that some heavy products with some conjugated π-bond structures are formed. Polymerization of furfuryl alcohol in an aqueous medium under the acidic conditions is the main cause for the low yield of levulinic acid. During the conversion of furfuryl alcohol to levulinic acid, the furan ring in furfuryl alcohol has to be opened and some reaction intermediates with the carbonyl functionality would be formed. These reaction intermediates could possibly involve in the Aldol condensation reaction, forming heavier organics. One direct evidence for not eliminating the oxygen-containing functionalities effectively via the polymerization reactions is the elemental analysis of the polymer formed from polymerization of glucose [119]. These abundant oxygen-containing functionalities make the polymer or the intermediates/precursors of polymer very reactive towards polymerization reactions. As a reaction medium, ethanol also is able to suppress the polymerization of HMF, and ethyl levulinate could be produced as the dominant product. Furthermore, in methanol the conversion of HMF is quicker [144]. This is because HMF firstly react with methanol, producing the acetal or ether of HMF, which suppressed the polymerization of HMF during its further conversion to methyl levulinate. Nevertheless, the tendency for the polymerization of HMF in water is much milder than that of furfuryl alcohol (ca. 81% yield of levulinic acid from the conversion of HMF in water versus ca. 11% yield of levulinic acid from the conversion of furfuryl in water). The transformation of HMF to levulinic acid also involves the opening of the furan ring and the formation of the intermediates with the conjugated-π bonds and carbonyl functionalities. Nevertheless, the polymerization tendency of these reaction intermediates is lower than that of acid-catalyzed intermediates for the conversion of furfuryl alcohol. Possibly, the activation energy required from HMF to levulinic acid is lower than that from furfuryl alcohol to levulinic acid. The fundamental reason, however, needs to be further clarified. In addition, the yields of levulinic acid in the catalytic conversion of acid to glucose in water under the similar reaction conditions (i.e. same reaction temperature and using the same Amberlyst 70, a solid acidic resin catalyst) is ca. 50% with the conversion of glucose at nearly 100% [123]. This means that 50% of the glucose feedstock is converted to other outcomes as polymers rather than levulinic acid during the first step of dehydration of glucose to HMF and the second step for the further conversion of HMF. For the second step, which used HMF as the initial reactant, around 19% of the HMF feedstock are converted to other products including polymer, as ca. 81% yield of levulinic acid is obtained [144]. Considering these numbers together, it can be concluded that roughly 31% of glucose polymerize during the first step for the dehydration of glucose to HMF. HMF also shows a high tendency towards polymerization in the acid-catalyzed conversion of glucose or fructose [145–147]. HMF contains a hydroxyl group, an aldehyde group and a furan ring, all of which could be the sites for the initiation of polymerization reactions. This is because the addition of one proton to the hydroxyl group of HMF and the release of one molecule of water would form an intermediate with carbocation. The carbocation could react with another molecule of HMF or sugar to condense. The presence of the aldehyde group in HMF also activates the molecule in the Aldol-condensation reactions [118,119]. As is shown Fig. 7, the hydrolysis of HMF could break the ether bond in the furan ring, forming a reaction intermediate containing the conjugated π-bond, C=O, and –OH groups. This intermediate could further be transformed via isomerization to close the ring structure, forming 1,2,4-benzenetriol. 1,2,4-benzenetriol has a benzene ring with a conjugated π-bond structure with the hydroxyl group as the electron-donating functionalities, serving as the objective of electrophilic reagents to attack through electrophilic reactions. Nevertheless, if the hydroxyl group or aldehyde group of HMF are protected, an intermediate with two conjugated π-bonds would be formed via opening of the furan ring. With such a structure it would be very difficult for the intermediate to undergo the isomerization to form 1,2,4-benzenetriol. Thus, protection of the hydroxyl group and the carbonyl group of HMF via the reaction with methanol changes the reaction pathways and suppress the polymerization reactions. In the above studies [118,119], the identification of 2-(dimethoxymethyl)-5-(methoxymethyl)furan (DMMF), which is an acetal/ether of HMF, is the key for reaching the conclusion that protection of the reactive functionalities could suppress the polymerization reactions. This process for understanding of the reaction medium also indicate that some reaction intermediates or products with trace or negligible concentrations might convey essential information for understanding the main reaction pathways. As is shown, the functionalities and elemental composition of the polymer formed with glucose as a starting reactant have been characterized using FT-IR and elemental analysis, respectively [119]. The polymer mainly contains the functionalities such as OH, CO, CC, aliphatic COC and aromatic rings. The elemental analysis of the polymer show that the C content in the polymer and in glucose were 49.9 and 40%, respectively. Some dehydration reactions take place, leading to the increased carbon content and correspondingly decreased oxygen content (from 53.3% in glucose to 46.7% in the polymer) and hydrogen content (from 6.7% in glucose to 3.4% in the polymer). Nevertheless, the oxygen content remained at a high level, indicating that the majority of the oxygen-containing functional groups such as the OH and CO groups are retained in the polymer. 2.4.2 Polymerization of furfural Furfural, the main product from the dehydration of the C5 sugars, shows a very high tendency towards polymerization in the presence of the solid acid resin catalyst whether in water or in methanol [148,149]. This is different from that of HMF. HMF could also polymerize under the acidic conditions in aqueous medium, but it could also decompose to form levulinic acid. These two types of reactions occur in parallel and are competitive. In comparison, over the Brønsted acid catalyst, there is no outlet for the further conversion of furfural but to polymerize during the prolonged reaction time [121,150]. There has been a number of studies employing Lewis acid catalyst to catalyze the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol in the alcohols such as isopropanol as the hydrogen donor [151–153]. Under such circumstance, the polymerization of furfural is suppressed to a significant extent [154–157]. The high tendency of furfural towards polymerization relates to its intrinsic structures. Furfural contains the structure of a furan ring and an aldehyde group. The aldehyde group makes furfural reactive in the Aldol condensation reactions, whereas the furan ring is aromatic and possibly become the objective for the assault by an electrophile via the electrophilic substitution reactions. More significantly, the furan ring can be opened via hydrolysis, forming even more reactive intermediates. As is shown in Fig. 8 , the opening of a furan ring forms intermediates with multiple carbonyl functionalities and conjugated π bonds, in which more reactive sites are created. Consequently, the polymerization reactions continue. Especially, the polymerization of the reactive intermediates with furfural does not necessarily eliminate the reactive functionalities and thus the polymerization could proceed to the stage of forming insoluble polymer. Some of the solvents such as hydroxyl acetone and cyclopentanone could not only react with furfural or the reaction intermediates formed from the degradation of xylose or furfural, but also affect the catalytic performance of the solid acid resin catalysts used. 2.4.3 Polymerization during the conversion of furfural to HMF Previous studies indicate that, in the methanol medium and in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst and an acid catalyst at high pressure, xylose could be converted to levulinic acid/ester via one-pot reactions [130]. Nevertheless, such a process requires the use of high pressure, a hydrogenation catalyst and hydrogen which increases the cost. Furthermore, the yields of levulinic acid/ester are relatively low (typically at 25%). Other processes need to be developed to tackle these issues. Via acid catalysis, HMF could decompose to form levulinic acid while furfural mainly polymerize [158,159]. These two furans have different structures. Nevertheless, the transformation of furfural to HMF would achieve the direct conversion of furfural or xylose to levulinic acid/ester. The reaction scheme proposed is to convert furfural to HMF by the electrophilic substitution for adding hydroxymethyl group to furfural [131]. Formaldehyde is considered as the first candidate of the electrophile, the source of hydroxyl group. Nevertheless, commercially available formaldehyde generally contains abundant water. Under acidic conditions, the exist of water could accelerate the polymerization of furfural [160]. Thus, to avoid the presence of water in the reaction medium, dimethoxymethane, the acetal of formaldehyde, is used as the electrophile. This concept has been confirmed, as is shown in Fig. 9 . Xylose could be transformed directly into levulinic acid/ester in dimethoxymethane in the exist of Amberlyst 70. Nevertheless, the yields of levulinic acid/ester just reached 15.1%. It is assumed that polymerization reaction is the main reason for the low yields of levulinic acid/ester. The characterization of the liquid products by UV-fluorescence spectroscopy does show the formation of soluble humins with large conjugated π structures. The previous studies have indicated that alcohols could suppress the polymerization reactions [118,119]. Thus, the results show that, with methanol as the co-solvent, the yields of levulinic acid/ester are the highest (ca. 51%). The characterization with UV fluorescence spectroscopy shows that the presence of methanol as a co-solvent could remarkably suppress the polymerization reactions. Glucose and HMF also could be converted to levulinic acid/ester in the mixed medium of dimethoxymethane and methanol, but the yields are lower than that in methanol medium only [131]. The reason for the lower yields of levulinic acid/ester from glucose and HMF in dimethoxymethane/methanol medium are further explored [131]. The results show that the levulinic acid or methyl levulinate produced could react with dimethoxymethane via Aldol condensation reactions. The intermediate products produced maintain the carbonyl functionalities and could continue to aggregate via the condensation reactions to form the soluble or insoluble polymer, as is shown in Fig. 10 . The presence of methanol could suppress the Aldol condensation reaction to some extent, but could not totally prevent the occurrence of the reaction. This is also the main reason for the low yields of levulinic acid/ester from xylose in dimethoxymethane alone. Adding methanol as the co-solvent could inhibit the polymerization reactions to some extent, and increase the yields of levulinic acid/ester from xylose, but the polymerization via Aldol condensation between levulinic acid/ester and dimethoxymethane still occurs. How to effectively inhibit the occurrence of the Aldol condensation reaction is the crux to improve the yields in levulinic acid/ester from C5 sugars, which warrants further investigation. 2.4.4 Polymerization of furan Compared with HMF, furfural or furfuryl alcohol, furan does not have a hydroxyl group or a carbonyl group, but only a furan ring. The results show that during the acid-catalyzed conversion of furan in water, only trace amounts of benzofuran are formed with the formation of tetrahydrofuran-2,5-diol and succinaldehyde as the intermediate products with negligible concentrations [161]. The major product is coke. The particular reaction pathways for the conversion of furan to benzofuran in methanol are shown in Fig. 11 . The first step from furan to benzofuran is the hydration of the furan ring to form tetrahydrofuran-2,5-diol via the addition of two protons to the C2 or the C5 position of the furan ring. The following step of opening of the furan ring and the dehydration reactions produce succinaldehyde. The protonation of the aldehyde group forms a carbocation, which would attack the furan ring via the electrophilic substitution reaction. The further electrophilic substitution reaction and the dehydration reaction produce benzofuran. Benzofuran could also be the target for the attack with a carbocation formed from succinaldehyde, producing dibenzofuran. The major differences in the transformation of furan in methanol and aqueous media are the yields of benzofuran and the polymer formed. Furan mainly polymerized in water, giving a yield of 90% of the polymer while the yield of benzofuran is less than 1%. In comparison, in methanol, the yield of benzofuran reach ca. 24%. The main reason for such a difference is the distinct functionalities of the reaction intermediates involved in the conversion. In water, tetrahydrofuran-2,5-diol and succinaldehyde are formed as the intermediate products. These intermediates, especially succinaldehyde, are very reactive towards polymerization. In methanol medium, instead of tetrahydrofuran-2,5-diol and succinaldehyde, 2,5-dimethoxytetrahydrofuran and 1,1,4,4-tetramethoxybutane are formed as the main reaction intermediates. Similarly, the formation of these ethers and acetals protects the reactive functionalities, suppressing their polymerization. Nevertheless, the yield of benzofuran produced is not high. This is because that benzofuran could not be a stable product in the acidic conditions and will continued to react to form dibenzofuran. Hydrolysis of the dibenzofuran produce the 2,6'-biphenyldiol, which is a phenolic compound and their further polymerization could not be inhibited with methanol. How to suppress the further polymerization of benzofuran and the resulting phenolics determines the selectivity from the conversion of furan to benzofuran. There has a number of other studies about the conversion of furfuryl alcohol in the alcohols like methanol or ethanol to levulinates [162–188]. These studies mainly employ the alcoholysis of furfuryl alcohol as a model reaction for testing the catalytic performances of the catalysts developed. Since this review mainly focuses on the aspect of the polymerization of furans and sugars, the details for the various catalysts developed for the acid catalyzed conversion of furfuryl alcohol are not discussed herein. In terms of polymerization of furfuryl alcohol in alcohols over the various catalysts, the general conclusion is that with alcohol as the reaction medium could be effectively inhibited the polymerization of furfuryl alcohol."
8,Effects of the sugar structures on their polymerization tendencies,"2.5 Effects of the sugar structures on their polymerization tendencies Hydrolysis of biomass generally produces a mixture of sugars with distinct molecular structures [190,191]. Sugar structural configuration might affect its tendencies towards polymerization. The acid-catalyzed conversion of sugar monomers (fructose, glucose, levoglucosan, galactose) and sugar oligomers (sucrose, maltose, raffinose and β-cyclodextrins) in ethanol/water confirmed that the structures of the sugars significantly affect the distribution of the products, including polymer [189]. The results show that, for the sugar monomers under the same experimental conditions, the yields of levulinic acid/ester followed the order: fructose > glucose > levoglucosan > galactose. HMF is the reaction intermediate in the formation of levulinic acid/ester from the sugars. [192,193]. The formation of HMF involves the formation of the reaction intermediates of the furanose form of the sugar [194–196]. The furanose form can be isomerized from the glucose in pyranose form. Levoglucosan has to be firstly hydrolyzed to glucose and then isomerized. As for galactose, the pyranose form also needs to be isomerized to the furanose form, but the furanose from of galactose has a different configuration from that from fructose, as is shown in Fig. 12 . During the further isomerization process, some other reactions also occur at the same time. For example, during the transformation of levoglucosan and galactose, much more dihydroxyacetone has produced. The formation of these by-products diminishes the production of levulinic acid/ester. For the sugar oligomers (sucrose, maltose, raffinose and β-cyclodextrins), their reaction behaviors are generally determined by their sugar monomers. For example, maltose has two glucose unit and the yields of levulinic acid/ester almost equal to that from glucose. Sucrose and raffinose contain fructose unit and the yields of levulinic acid/ester are also higher than that from glucose or maltose. Furthermore, the conversion of the sugar oligomers encounters some steric hindrance, which slowed down their conversion rates. Nevertheless, the bigger sizes of the sugar oligomers do not necessarily give a much higher yield of the insoluble polymer during the acid-catalyzed conversions. The amount of polymer is the lowest in the acid-catalyzed conversion of fructose, because there are least steps involved from fructose to levulinic acid/ester. Levoglucosan and galactose needs more steps to isomerize to the furanose form for the dehydration to HMF. During the process, other side reactions also take place. Consequently, more polymer is formed. Raffinose contains the galactose unit and its acid-catalyzed conversion also produces more polymer. Although β-cyclodextrins has the biggest molecule size among the sugars investigated, the yields of the insoluble polymer are not the highest. The above results clearly indicated that the tendencies of the sugar oligomers towards polymerization are affected by their basic sugar units and structural configurations."
9,Cross-polymerization,"2.6 Cross-polymerization 2.6.1 Cross-polymerization among different types of sugars In bio-oil, there are many types of sugars co-existing, and they have different structures [197,198]. During the acid treatment of bio-oil, not only sugars, furans and phenols can naturally polymerize with each other [199–201], but also these sugars have been converted simultaneously [202]. It has been widely accepted that the intermediates from degradation of the sugars with varied structures and functionalities might react with each other, leading to the cross-polymerization reactions [203–206]. This enhances polymerization reactions and might produce more polymers [207]. To verify this hypothesis, the acid catalytic conversion of monosaccharide and mixed sugars are conducted and the different yields of the insoluble polymer are measured [208]. The first example is the acid treatment of xylose, glucose and xylose/glucose together. Xylose and glucose are the representative C5 and C6 sugars derived from the hydrolysis of hemicellulose and cellulose, and their dehydration produces different intermediates (i.e. furfural versus HMF) that are reactive towards polymerization [209]. The co-existence of these reaction intermediates might lead to the occurrences of the cross-polymerization reactions [210]. Nevertheless, the results show that, in the water medium, the quantity of the insoluble polymer converted from the acid-catalyzed conversion of the mixture of glucose/xylose equaled to the sum quantity of the polymer converted from the acid-catalyzed conversion of glucose alone and xylose individually. This result indicates that the cross-polymerization between xylose and glucose, if exist, will not result in the formation of more insoluble polymers. The characterization of the soluble polymer with UV fluorescence shows that the structures of the conjugated π bonds of that from acid-catalyzed conversion of glucose/xylose are different from that of acid-catalyzed conversion of the single sugar [208]. In other word, the cross-polymerization does occur, but does not result in the formation of additional amounts of polymers. In addition to the water medium, the acid catalytic conversion of mixed sugars in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are also conducted. Basically, similar results have been obtained: the total quantity of insoluble polymer from the acid-catalyzed conversion of the mixed glucose/xylose equaled to the sum amount of the insoluble polymer from the individual sugars. This result obtained in DMSO medium again confirms that the cross-polymerization between glucose and xylose shows an insignificant impact on the formation of additional amounts of the insoluble polymer. In addition, it is found that DMSO has no ability to control the polymerization of glucose but could remarkably inhibit the polymer formation from xylose. Furthermore, it is also found that the content of the sugars in the reaction medium (from 10 to 33 wt%) does not necessarily relate to the amount of polymer formed under the reaction conditions employed (water medium, T = 180 °C; reaction time: 120 min; Amberlyst 70 as the catalyst). The cross-polymerization between glucose and xylose do not contribute to the formation of the insoluble polymer. The acid-catalyzed conversion of fructose/raffinose produced additional amount of insoluble polymer than that from the individual sugar. This is probably related to the increased concentration of HMF in the reaction medium, similar to the cross-polymerization of HMF with furfural or fructose, which is discussed in the following section. 2.6.2 Cross-polymerization of sugars and furans The furans are among the main products from the dehydration of C6 sugars and C5 sugars [211–213]. They would co-exist with the unconverted sugars in the same reaction mixture. Both furans and sugars contain the reactive functionalities and they might potentially cross-polymerize with each other [214–216]. To confirm this, the acid-catalyzed conversion of glucose, xylose, HMF, furfural, HMF/glucose, HMF/fructose, HMF/furfural, furfural/glucose, furfural/fructose and furfural/xylose are performed, respectively, with Amberlyst 70 as the catalyst in the water medium [217]. HMF does not affect much the conversion of glucose [217]. The theoretical yields of levulinic acid almost equaled to the actual ones. The quantity of the insoluble polymer converted from the acid-catalyzed conversion of HMF/glucose mixture equals to the sum amount of the polymer from HMF and glucose individually. Glucose and HMF are converted independently over the same catalyst and they do not interfere with each other remarkably. This result indicates that the cross-polymerization between HMF and glucose are insignificant in terms of the formation of the insoluble polymers. While the acid catalytic conversion of HMF/fructose, however, the situation is different. The yields of levulinic acid from the acid-catalyzed conversion of the HMF/fructose is lower than the theoretical value, and the total amount of the insoluble polymer formed is higher than that from the sum amount of the polymer produced from the acid-catalyzed conversion of HMF or fructose individually. The very similar phenomenon could be observed for the acid-catalyzed conversion of HMF/furfural mixture. The results indicated that the cross-polymerization between HMF and fructose or furfural did exist. In addition, it is also found that fructose and raffinose could cross-polymerize, forming more insoluble polymers. Taking the results herein into consideration, it can be concluded that HMF play important roles in the cross-polymerization reactions, which could cross-polymerize with furfural, fructose and raffinose. The potential cross-polymerization reactions between furfural and mono sugars (fructose, glucose and xylose) are also investigated [217]. The cross-polymerization between furfural and fructose existed, producing more insoluble polymers. This result aligns with the cross-polymerization between furfural and HMF, as discussed above. This is understandable as the dehydration of fructose produce abundant HMF, which then cross-polymerizes with the furfural to form more insoluble polymer. The cross-polymerization between glucose and furfural, as expected, is not significant [217]. This is because HMF play an intermediate product with a low concentration in the process of the conversion of glucose to levulinic acid. Furthermore, furfural does not significantly interact with glucose or other intermediates from glucose to form more insoluble polymer. Furfural is a major product from the dehydration of xylose and the cross-polymerization between furfural and xylose has been assumed as the main routes for formation of soluble or insoluble polymers [131,145]. Nevertheless, the experimental results show that the interaction between xylose and furfural do not cause the additional constitution of the insoluble polymer. The further exploration of the origin for the polymer formation indicates that the insoluble polymer is mainly produced from the polymerization of furfural. The results show that the additional formation of polymer from the step of dehydration of xylose to furfural towards polymer formation is very little. Furthermore, the conjugated π bonds structural features of the soluble polymer formed from xylose are almost identical to those from furfural, further suggesting the dominant roles of furfural in the formation of the insoluble polymer. This result discloses the original source of the polymer formation and the roles of xylose and furfural in the formation of the polymer, which could be a reference for developing the methods for suppressing occurrence of the polymerization reactions in the conversion of xylose, hemicellulose or biomass to furfural. Furfural can be converted into other stable products, such as levulinic acid/ester in dimethoxymethane, to suppress the polymerization of itself [218]. It needs to note that the cross-polymerization between different types of sugars might not procced to a significant extent in the bio-oil produced via the fast pyrolysis. However, the cross-polymerization between sugars or the derivatives of sugars and other organics in bio-oil could take place. This is because the degradation of sugars via dehydration or decomposition could generate some reactive fragments. In addition, the cross-polymerization between the sugars and furans should also be considered in the hydrolysis of biomass as they are the important fractions in the products."
10,Polymerization during the acid-catalysed conversion of bio-oil,
11,Quantification of acidic functional groups in bio-oil,"3.1 Quantification of acidic functional groups in bio-oil Many polymerization reactions are catalyzed by acids [219]. In bio-oil such as the one produced by the pyrolysis of mallee leaves, there are numbers of carboxylic acids with varied structures present [220]. Furthermore, there are also heavy carboxylic acids that could not be detected with GC-MS. To quantify the total number of the carboxylic acids in bio-oil, a non-aqueous potentiometric titration method is developed [221]. The results show that abundant carboxylic acids present in the bio-oil, especially in the bio-oil after pyrolysis of mallee leaves are heavy ones [221]. Although t raising the pyrolysis temperature from 350 to 580 °C could decrease the portion of the heavy carboxylic acids, the abundance of the heavy acids in the bio-oil is still significant. In addition, the majority of phenolic compounds could not be detected with GC-MS. These heavy components might play important roles in the polymerization of bio-oil, which requires further investigation. As a very complicated compound organics, how the carboxylic acids impact the polymerization of other components of bio-oil warrants further investigation [219]."
12,Polymerization of bio-oil during acid-catalysed conversion,"3.2 Polymerization of bio-oil during acid-catalysed conversion It has been well-known that bio-oil has a tendency to polymerization, particularly at high temperatures. In our previous study, we found that, even mixing bio-oil with Amberlyst 70 at room temperature, some solid residual in catalyst could form [222]. Bio-oil is very complex in composition [223–225]. It has not been clear if the solid residual is the insoluble polymer formed via the acid-catalyzed reactions or the absorption of some organics. The acid treatment of bio-oil in water produce ca. 27.6% of insoluble polymer, while with methanol as the reaction medium the yield of polymer is ca. 15.4%. Methanol or other alcohols as the reaction medium could clearly suppress the polymerization reactions to some extent. It needs to note that the alcohols with the varied structures such as methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol and 1-butanol show the similar capability to suppress the polymerization reactions. Ethylene glycol or phenol as the reaction medium shows the lower capability for suppression of the polymerization reactions."
13,Polymerization of sugars/furans in acid treatment of bio-oil,"3.3 Polymerization of sugars/furans in acid treatment of bio-oil 3.3.1 Conversion of C6 sugars during bio-oil esterification Bio-oil is the pyrolysis of biomass to produce a condensable liquid [226–228]. Compared with biomass, bio-oil usually has a higher total volumetric energy density. In addition, bio-oil can be transported at a much lower cost than bulky biomass Bio-oil generally has a higher bulk volumetric energy density than biomass and could be transported at a much lower cost than the bulky biomass [229,230]. However, bio-oil has a large amount of oxygenated organics like sugar monomers/oligomers, aldehydes, ketones, furans, esters, ethers, mono phenols and pyrolytic lignin with a wide range of functionalities such as hydroxyl groups, carbonyls groups, carboxylic groups and conjugated π-bonds [231–234]. The sugars and their derivatives are mainly concentrated in the aqueous phase of bio-oil, as is shown in Table 1 , while the lignin derived phenolics are mainly in the water insoluble phases. Many of the functional groups of these varied organics do not exist in biomass and are created during pyrolysis, giving bio-oil different reactivities from the raw biomass. These functional groups together are very reactive towards polymerization during both storage and thermal treatment [219,235]. Furthermore, the carboxylic acids could act as the catalysts for accelerating the polymerization reactions [236]. The abundant carboxylic acids also affect the properties of bio-oil by making it corrosive [237–239]. These bad characteristics prevent bio-oil from being directly used as vehicle fuel. The corrosiveness of bio-oil could be tackled by esterification or the acid treatment in alcohols to convert the corrosive acids into neutral esters [240,241]. Nevertheless, compare with the simple carboxylic acid esterification process, the reaction network in the bio-oil esterification process is more complicated [242]. Sugars, furans, esters and phenolics could all be converted via various reaction pathways. Considering the substantial effects of esterification on the modification of the distribution of organics in bio-oil, some effort has been made to understand the reaction pathways during the acid treatment. [242]. Sugar monomers or oligomers are derived from the degradation of cellulose or hemicellulose and accounts for a significant portion in bio-oil [243,244]. For example, the concentration of the anhydrous sugar, levoglucosan, is ca. 5 wt% in the bio-oil produced from mallee biomass [242], which actually is a significant number when considering that bio-oil contains hundreds of organic species. As a result, a special attention is paid to the conversion of levoglucosan during the esterification of bio-oil at the varied temperatures [245]. The results show that, at a lower reaction temperatures, more levoglucosan could be formed at a relatively low temperature. Possibly, some oligomers presented in the bio-oil continued to degrade or break down at low temperatures (70°C) over time to form more levoglucosan. The conversion of levoglucosan at the low reaction temperature is negligible but became significant at the higher reaction temperature (Fig. 1). Methyl glucopyranosides are produced as the corresponding products via the steps of hydrolysis of levoglucosan to glucose and the subsequent etherification of glucose with methanol (Fig. 1). The abundance of methyl glucopyranosides increased with increasing temperature, but decreased at the high reaction temperature such as 170 °C, which was mainly converted into levulinic acid/ester. Thus, it was possible to produce directly the levulinic acid/ester from the acid-treatment of bio-oil in alcohols, as discussed in the following sections. 3.3.2 Polymerization of sugars/furans in bio-oil during their conversion to levulinic acid/ester In bio-oil, there are a number of organics that could potentially be converted to levulinic acid/esters via acid treatment [246]. For examples, almost all the C6 sugars including the anhydrous sugar like levoglucosan are the precursors of levulinic acid/ester. Some sugar oligomer could also hydrolyze to form the mono sugars [243]. The furans like HMF, the acetal/ether of HMF, and furfuryl alcohol could also be converted to levulinic acid/ester via acid-catalyzed reactions [247–250]. The previous studies have clearly indicated that, in the water-rich medium, the sugars and furans mainly polymerized, producing polymer as the main product [118,124]. Alcohols are thus required to enhance the yields of levulinic acid/ester from the acid treatment of bio-oil. Our results show that the content of methanol in the reaction medium significantly affect the production of levulinic acid/ester and the yields of the insoluble polymer formed [225]. A higher content of methanol promotes the formation of levulinic acid/ester while suppressed the polymerization reactions, resulting in the formation of less amount of insoluble polymer. In such a process, the involvement of alcohols transfers the main skeleton of alcohols in the products, such as the formation of levulinates in alcohol medium instead of levulinic acid in water medium. Bio-oil is a compound of organics which have the very complicated component. Except for sugars or furans, there are also many other organics. The presence of methanol could also restrain the polymerization of other constituents such as phenolics, which will be discussed below later. The co-existence of these organics together with sugars/furans creates an issue with the separation of levulinic acid/ester from others products. Some effort has been devoted to solve this issue [225]. The components in bio-oil could generally be categorized into sugars, sugar derivatives and phenolics with small to big (pyrolytic lignin) molecular sizes. The sugars and sugar derivatives are generally oxygen-rich, rendering them higher polarities than the lignin derivatives. Thus, it will be possible to separate the sugar derivatives from the lignin derivatives via water extraction. The separation of the components in bio-oil via water extraction are thus explored [251–255]. The results show that the majorities of the sugars could be extracted into the water phase, while around 10 to 30% of the light organics could also be extracted to the water phase. This is because the phenolics still contain the polar hydroxyl group and could be partially dissolved in water. The phenolics generally have a higher boiling point, some of which are even close to that of levulinic acid. This would inevitably create the difficulty for the separation of levulinic acid from the phenolics. Therefore, further separation is necessary. A series of trial experiments about using various solvents to extract the phenolics in bio-oil have been performed, and dichloromethane has found to be an effective solvent to separate the phenolics from the sugars in the watery phase of bio-oil, exhibited in Table 1. Further to this, chloroform as the solvent also could effectively extract methyl levulinate from levulinic acid, achieving the separation of these two targeting products. The reaction scheme for the production of levulinic acid/ester from bio-oil and the following separation of methyl levulinate from levulinic acid is proposed in Fig. 13 ."
14,Polymerization of mixed typical model compounds in bio-oil,"3.4 Polymerization of mixed typical model compounds in bio-oil Some typical compounds in bio-oil have been selected to investigate their polymerization or cross-polymerization during the thermal treatment with or without carboxylic acids [236]. It could be proved from the results that in an aqueous medium and in the existence of acetic acid/formic acid, the yield of the polymer formed is 14.7%. In comparison, in the absence of the carboxylic acids, the yield of the polymer is only 3.4%, indicating that carboxylic acids are the catalysts for catalyzing the polymerization reactions. In addition, in methanol in the existence of acetic acid/formic acid, the yield of the polymer formed is 4.6%, indicating that methanol as the reaction medium could effectively inhibit the polymerization. Methanol, in fact, reacted with the carboxylic acids and transformed them into the neutral esters. The cross-polymerization reactions between the organics investigated also existed, as is shown in Fig.14 . The furans such as furfuryl alcohol and HMF could condense via intermolecular reactions. Hydroxyl acetone could react with guaiacol via electrophilic substitution reactions. There are also a number of heavier organics formed, probably due to the occurrences of the further cross-polymerization reactions. Again, the reaction medium shows significant impacts on the polymerization of the organics. In the methanol medium, the conversions of the compounds such as furan, cyclopentanone, phenol and guaiacol are much lower than that in the water medium. Methanol could stabilize these compounds. On the other hand, the compounds like vanillin containing the unsaturated functionality also has a high conversion in methanol as it is quite reactive and methanol as the reaction medium is not enough to prevent its further conversion. It should be noted here that the conversion of these compounds does not necessarily mean the conversion via polymerization. Vanillin might also react with methanol via acetalization reactions, which needs further verification. In addition, in the process of the acid-catalyzed conversion of the phenolic compounds, the reactions like demethylation, demethoxylation and methoxylation also take place to varied extents. Tomishige et al have done very systematic work on the demethylation and demethoxylation reactions of the phenolic compounds like guaiacol with noble metal-based catalyst under hydrogen-deficient or sufficient conditions [256–258]. The detailed reaction network for the conversion of the phenolics via these ways have been proposed. In the future work, the distinct reaction behaviours of the typical phenolics obtained from the biomass pyrolysis under the typical conditions of acid catalysis and hydrogenation also deserves particular attention."
15,Impacts of the polymerization of bio-oil on the solid acid resin catalyst,"3.5 Impacts of the polymerization of bio-oil on the solid acid resin catalyst In the process of upgrading bio-oil to biofuels, the polymerization of bio-oil not only resulted in the consumption of the feedstock to reduce the biofuels produced, but also resulted in the inactivation of the catalyst [259–265]. The inactivation of the solid acid catalyst is noticed during the esterification of the bio-oils. Amberlyst 70 was used as the catalyst and its specifications could be found in the reference: [266]. Amberlyst 70 is produced from the sulfonation between the benzene ring in the polystyrene structure with concentrated sulphuric acid. There also exists the similar type of solid acid catalysts such as Amberlyst 15 [267], Amberlyst 35 [268], Amberlyst 36 [269]. Leaching of the SO3H functionality from these solid acidic resin catalysts at the high reaction temperature in especially protic reaction medium is a major challenge for their application. The solid acid catalyst, like Amberlyst 70, with the wider window of operating temperature is more preferable for conversion of the sugars/furans particularly at the higher reaction temperature. In addition to the Amberlyst series catalysts, there are also a number of other solid acid catalysts used in conversion of sugars/furans, which can refer to the review paper [270]. Acetic acid is the main component of carboxylic acid in bio-oils. The conversion of acetic acid in the bio-oils produced from mallee wood, mallee bark and mallee leaves, respectively, under the similar conditions are compared. Interestingly, the conversion of acetic acid varied significantly in esterifying the three different bio-oils, as is shown in Fig. 15 [271]. The authors explored the origin for the distinct catalytic performances of the catalyst. The total acid numbers in the used catalysts were measured with a back-titration method and the results show that the catalyst deactivates significantly after the first cycle of the use. The catalyst deactivates to different extents after catalyzing the esterification of different bio-oils. It is believed that the difference in the bio-oils is supposed to be the main reason for the different extent of catalyst deactivation. In the process of characterizing bio-oil produced from the pyrolysis of mallee bark, the abundant metal ions, especially the calcium ions, were found in the bio-oil. Amberlyst 70 is a solid acid resin catalyst bearing the SO3H groups. The metal ions in the bio-oil probably lead to the ion exchange reactions, leading to the loss of the hydrogen ions from the catalyst. Such phenomenon has also been observed in the esterification of other bio-oils, up to the content of metal ions in the bio-oil. In addition to metal ions, the nitrogenous organics in the bio-oil produced from mallee leaves is also a major cause for the deactivation of the catalyst. Chlorophyll is an important component of leaves, which contains nitrogen and some nitrogen is transformed into bio-oil during pyrolysis. Many N-containing organics are base, which might react with the acid catalyst, causing the loss of the hydrogen ions. To confirm this, the authors mixed the bio-oil derived from mallee leaves with fresh catalysts at room temperature and it was found that the catalyst deactivated almost instantly during the contact with the bio-oil. This confirms that the nitrogenous organic compounds react with the acidic sites of the catalyst via acid-base neutralization reactions, leading to almost complete inactivation of the catalyst. The formation of polymer inside the pores of the catalyst is also an important cause for the catalyst deactivation. As mentioned above, Amberlyst 70 is a solid resin catalyst and it will expand in protic reaction medium, exposing the acidic sites inside the pores to the reactants. The small molecules could react in the vicinity of the acidic sites and diffuse out of the pores. However, if the reactants polymerize with the pores, they might be trapped in the pores and eventually block the pores, leading to the deactivation of the catalyst. After the esterification of the wood bio-oil, bark bio-oil and leave bio-oil, the ratios of the amount of the polymer formed to the catalyst loaded are 109.7, 103.2 and 77.6%, respectively. The substantial amount of coke formed clearly affect the activity of the catalysts. The regeneration of the deactivated catalysts are also investigated. The results show that, the surface of the used catalysts was covered with some substances from bio-oil with the high affinity on surface of the catalyst, which might block the pores of the catalysts. Washing the used catalyst with acetone could validly eliminate the substances. Nevertheless, such a process does little to improve the catalytic performances of the catalyst. The metal ions are introduced to the catalysts via ion exchange, and the catalyst is immersed in concentrated sulfuric acid using the same ion exchange method to recover acidic sites. The results show that the hydrogen ions could be exchanged back to the active sites of the catalyst. Furthermore, via the ion exchange, the N-containing organics could also be removed from the catalysts. The catalytic activity of the used catalyst is partially recovered. The reason for not achieving the full recovery of the activity is due to the polymer formed. The polymer inside the pores of the catalyst could not be washed away or be removed via the ion exchange process. This is especially more visually obviously with the spent catalyst from the esterification of the bio-oil from the pyrolysis of mallee leaves. After being washed with organic solvents, some substance on surface of the catalyst still could not be removed, which has a high affinity to the surface of the catalyst. Further to this, the polymer could not be burned away as the catalyst is a carbonaceous material, which imposes a challenge for the use of the carbon-based catalyst in esterification of the bio-oil with complicated composition and high tendency towards polymerization."
16,Beneficial use of the polymerization of bio-oil for the production of solid biocarbon,"The above discussion indicated that the major components of bio-oil are prone to polymerization on heating. The mechanisms for the polymerization have been studied intensively. The methods for tackling the polymerization of bio-oil such as the conversion of bio-oil or the major components of bio-oil in alcohol solvent have been developed. Alcohols could suppress the polymerization of some furans and sugars. Nevertheless, even in the alcohol media, some components like xylose and furfural are still very reactive towards polymerization. How to validly inhibit the polymerization of bio-oil remains the primary challenge in using bio-oil as the raw material for the production of biofuels. However, in addition to biofuels, bio-oil could also be a potential feedstock for the production of carbon materials. The high tendency of bio-oil towards polymerization could thus be an inherent beneficial nature for the use as the feedstock for production of carbon material. It has practical meaning for the production of biocarbon from bio-oil or from biomass as the new biocarbon materials could find such wide uses as industrial reductants or electrode materials. In fact, biomass is the only carbon-containing renewable resource that can be used directly to make carbon materials. It has a much lower sulphur content than coal for improved environmental performance. However, on heating, biomass will undergo extremely limited extents of melting, producing little metaplast and thus resulting in a porous and fragile biochar. Indeed, biomass has been used to make porous biocarbon materials with a wide range of micro- and meso-pores, e.g. activated carbon [272] and even electrodes in batteries [273] and supercapacitors [274,275]. Therefore, the inherent characteristics of biomass means that the direct pyrolysis of biomass cannot produce dense biocarbon materials to replace metallurgical coke or heavy-duty electrodes. Following a similar philosophy in making the heavy-duty electrodes from the coal tar pitch for the aluminium industry, R&D efforts have been made to use biomass-derived heavy liquids, viz. “biopitch” [276,277], to make dense or specialised biocarbon materials. Compared with coal, biomass has inherently higher oxygen content and less aromaticity, so only very low yields of biopitch could be produced directly [276,277]. A new process to produce dense carbon materials from biomass is urgently needed. As a response to the urgent needs in this field, Hu and Li developed a method for the production of high-yield carbonaceous material via the polymerization of bio-oil at the temperatures from 140 to 280 °C with furfural as a polymerization agent [278,279]. The technical route for production of the carbon materials is shown in Fig. 16 . Their results show that the yields of carbonaceous material of >90% (wet basis) have been obtained. In fact, the mixture of furfural/bio-oil is turned completely into a solid after heating to above 170 °C, with water, acetic acid, and some mono-phenols incorporated or absorbed in the solid. The importance of the study is to enhance the utilisation of the carbon in bio-oil or in the biomass precursor. Furthermore, the biocarbon material has a low to nil ash yield and a low content of nitrogen or sulphur species, which would render the bio-oil derived material with various potential applications. This work provides an alternative outlet for the application of bio-oil, which, actually, extends the utilisation of bio-oil from as the feedstock for biofuels/chemicals to a feedstock for production of carbon materials."
17,Concluding remarks and outlook,"The above sections briefly review the main work on understanding the effects of alcohol media on the polymerization reactions in the acid-catalyzed conversion of sugars, furans, phenolics and bio-oil. The drastic differences in terms of the polymer formation in water and in alcohol media has been observed. The protection of the C1 hydroxyl group in the glucose prevented the formation of the sugar oligomers, while the protection of the hydroxyl group and aldehyde group in HMF prevent the formation of the reactive intermediates such as phenolics. Therefore, the yields of levulinic acid/esters could be substantially improved. The alcohols show a similar effect for the suppression of the polymerization reactions during the conversion of furfuryl alcohol to levulinic acid/ester and the conversion of furan to benzofuran. In terms of the polymerization of the C5 sugars like xylose, alcohols as the reaction medium could also protect the reactive functionalities in xylose and in furfural, which could suppress the polymerization of xylose and furfural to some extent, especially at the mild temperatures. However, at the high reaction temperature, the high tendency of furfural towards polymerization eliminate the beneficial effects of alcohols towards polymerization. In the process of converting xylose into levulinic acid/ester by acid catalysis coupled with hydrogenation, alcohols could also be used to protected the carbonyl functionality in xylose to avoid the hydrogenation reaction and the polymerization reactions. However, alcohols show the negligible effects to suppress the further hydrogenation of the levulinic acid/esters. During the acid-catalyzed conversion of the mixtures of sugars and furans, the cross-polymerization reactions are not significant in terms in the formation of insoluble polymers for the conversion of glucose/HMF or xylose/furfural. The dehydration of glucose to HMF contributed significantly to polymer formation during the acid-catalyzed conversion reactions. In comparison, the polymer formed from the acid-catalyzed conversion of xylose mainly originated the step from the further polymerization of furfural, not from the step of the dehydration of xylose to furfural. Understanding of the detailed mechanism for the polymerization reactions and developing the effective reaction medium is of significance for the efficient conversion of biomass or the derivatives of biomass to the value-added chemicals or biofuels. To achieve this, several remaining issues need to be addressed in the future study. 1) For the acid-catalyzed conversion of the C5 sugars like xylose, the use of alcohols as the reaction medium could not effectively suppress the polymerization reactions, especially at the elevated reaction temperatures. The fundamental reason for the high tendency of furfural towards polymerization and the involvements of water or methanol in the degradation or polymerization of furfural needs to be further clarified. Understanding this also helps to understand the positive effects of alcohol media in suppression of the polymerization of the C6 sugars. 2) Alcohols could protect the aldehyde group via acetalization and the hydroxyl group via etherification reaction. These functionalities are generally the reactive centers during the acid-catalyzed conversion or hydrogenation reactions. For example, during hydrogenation reactions the carbonyl functionality could be hydrogenated, while the hydroxyl group could be removed via hydrogenolysis. How do the protection of the functionalities of these biomass-derived organics impact the hydrogenation reactions needs to be further clarified. 3) The replacement of the hydrogen functionality in the molecules of water with a methyl group gives methanol. In some sense, water could also be categorized as an alcohol. Nevertheless, the impacts of water and methanol on the polymerization of the C6 sugars like levoglucosan and glucose and the furans like HMF or furfuryl alcohols are drastically different. In water, the aldehydes also could react with water molecule to form the acetal. Thus, how do the structural differences of methanol and water affect the polymerization of sugars/furans needs further investigation. In addition, the alcohols with varied structures also impact the polymerization of sugars in different ways. For example, the ethylene glycol and 2-octanol as the reaction media are not as effective as methanol in suppression of the polymerization of levoglucosan in the acid-catalyzed conversion reactions. What are the relationship of the structures of the alcohols and their capability for suppression of the polymerization of sugars/furans needs to be further investigated. 4) In the acid-catalyzed conversion of sugars/furans, although alcohols as the reaction medium could suppress the polymerization reactions, in the presence of acid catalyst, the alcohols could also react with each other, forming volatile ethers. The formation of ethers would increase the autogenous pressure of the reaction, consume alcohols, and produce the undesirable water, while the presence of water in the reaction medium promotes polymerization reactions. How to suppress the intermolecular etherification of the alcohols is an issue to be resolved when alcohol was applied as the reaction medium in acidic conditions. 5) In addition to the intermolecular etherification of alcohols to form ethers, alcohols also could react with the targeting products. For example, in the acid-catalyzed conversion of C6 sugars/HMF in alcohols, the levulinic acid produced reacts with alcohols, producing the corresponding levulinic esters. Other single or mixed solvents (reaction medium) should be developed. The ideal solvent system is that the polymerization of sugars/furans could be effectively suppressed, while the solvent(s) used do not interfere with the production of the targeting products. 6) To develop the new solvent system for suppression the polymerization reactions, the mechanism for the polymerization of sugars, furans, phenolics and bio-oil have to be understood. In many studies dealings with the conversion of bio-oil or the main components of bio-oil, polymerization reactions have always been an inevitable issue. Although much effort has been devoted to this research area, the detailed mechanism for the polymerization reactions have not been fully understood yet. In the research about understanding the mechanism for the polymerization reactions, two aspects are equally important, which are the mechanism for the polymerization of a specific compound and the cross-polymerization between the different organic species. 7) During the upgrading of bio-oil or main components of bio-oil via acid-catalyzed conversion, solid acid catalyst is generally the preferable choice as the catalyst could be easily separated from the liquid products. Nevertheless, majority of solid acid catalysts are not immune to the deactivation caused by the deposit of polymers on surface of catalyst. This is because the polymer formed could cover the acidic sites or block the porous structures of the catalysts. Since in many cases the polymerization reactions are inevitable, the deactivated catalysts have to be regenerated via combustion to remove the organic polymer. To meet these criteria, the solid catalyst used for the conversion of the biomass derivatives have to be made from non-carbonaceous materials. Furthermore, the active sites of the catalyst have to be remaining stable after burning way of the coke species. In addition, as mentioned in the above sections, there are abundant heavy carboxylic acids, sugar oligomers and pyrolytic lignin in bio-oil. How to avoid the steric hindrance needs to be considered during the design of the solid acid catalyst for the acid-catalyzed conversion of biomass or the pretreatment of bio-oil via esterification. 8) The high tendency of the sugars, furans and other organics in bio-oil relates to not only the experimental conditions, but also their intrinsic nature, which, in fact, can be harnessed to produce carbon materials from these reactive organics, as discussed in Section 4. However, since bio-oil is a very complex mixture of organics, the mechanism for the polymerization reactions during heating of whole bio-oil would be rather complex. Furthermore, the complicated polymerization behaviors of the varied organics in bio-oil make the control of the properties of the synthesized carbon material rather difficult. Thus, it is of importance to understand the main routes for the polymerization of at least the organics of same family in bio-oil and the properties of the resulting carbon materials. The cross-polymerization of the organics of the different functionalities should also be focus of future research."
