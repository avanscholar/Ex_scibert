0,Introduction,"Electrochemical water splitting has been envisioned for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) alternative to the fossil fuels [1–3]. But the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) hinders the energy conversion efficiency of water splitting due to the large energy barrier and high theoretical H2O/O2 equilibrium potential of OER (1.23 V vs. RHE) [4,5]. Replacing OER with other anodic oxidation such as hydrazine, urea, alcohols etc., have been intensively investigated for energy-saving HER [6]. Especially, hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) is utilized to replace OER in overall water splitting (OWS) because of the ultralow thermodynamic oxidation potential (–0.33 V) of HzOR than OER [7]. Meanwhile, the eco-friendly N2/H2 rather than explosive O2/H2 mixture are produced by HzOR-assisted OWS, which makes it more attractive and has a great potential to replace OER in OWS system. Recently, some pioneering works have been reported on the transition metal-based advanced bifunctional catalysts for both HzOR and HER, and even HzOR-assisted OWS in alkaline medium [4,7–10]. However, limited by low HER performance compared to noble metals, the transition-based catalysts show insufficient activity for HzOR-assisted OWS. In addition, noble metal-free catalysts demonstrate superior HER catalytic behavior in acid medium, whereas the HzOR is usually performed in alkaline solution [11]. The different pH requirements of these catalysts limit their HzOR-assisted OWS applications in conventional alkaline medium, let alone the pH-universal HzOR-assisted OWS in both alkaline and neutral media. Particularly, the HzOR-assisted OWS under neutral solutions is considered benign and cost-effective but has rarely been achieved and underperformed because of the more sluggish kinetic rate of catalysts in neutral than acid and alkaline medium [12–14]. State-of-the-art catalytic chemistry for HER and HzOR extensively relies on platinum group metals, and reduce the particle sizes of noble metals to atomic scale can achieve 100% efficiency of atomic utilization and lower the cost of noble metal materials [15]. Noble-based single atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted great attention for HER, and ruthenium single atoms (Ru SAs) with its similar hydrogen bonding energy with platinum (Pt) and lowest cost among Pt group metals have been demonstrated superior activity in a broad pH ranges of HER [11,16–18]. Considering many advantages offered by SACs such as excellent activity, high selectivity, and superior durability in various catalytic reactions [19], the Ru SAs-based catalysts are expected to show great potential for HzOR-assisted OWS under a wide pH ranges, which is yet underdeveloped. Herein, we designed novel urchin-like tungsten trioxide consists of nanowires (NWs) which exposes abundant defects to isolate ruthenium single-atom sites (WO3/Ru SAs). As shown in Scheme 1 , the WO3 are grown on carbon cloth by hydrothermal and pyrolytic reaction. Through a facile galvanostatic deposition, the Ru SAs are confined in the oxygen vacancies (Vo) of WO3. Compared with conventional strategies for fabricating SACs such as pyrolysis, wet chemistry methods, and atom trapping etc., the fabrication of Ru SAs by galvanostatic deposition strategy includes several advantages such as fast and cost-effective for the SACs deposition, facile route for controlled synthesis of highly-dispersed SACs, no need for additional capping agents or reductants, and easy to prepare large scale SACs [20–22]. The obtained Vo-WO3/Ru SAs exhibit outstanding HER over a broad pH range. By coupling the HER and HzOR, the cell voltage is expected to decrease significantly in both alkaline and neutral solution, which is beneficial for the energy-saving and pH-universal HzOR-assisted OWS."

3,Preparation of Urchin-like CC@WO3,"2.2 Preparation of Urchin-like CC@WO3 The preparation method of CC@WO3 was similar to the reported reference with some modifications [23]. Typically, Na2WO4·2H2O (12.5 mmol) was added to the deionized water (100 mL) and stirred for 10 min until the Na2WO4·2H2O was dissolved completely. Subsequently, 3 M HCl (9.6 mL) were added dropwise to the above solution and the pH was adjusted to 1.2 to form yellowish solution. Then, the C2H2O4·2H2O (25 mmol) was added to the yellowish solution and diluted to 250 mL with deionized water. After stirring for 10 min, the above solution (15 mL) was poured into a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and 0.75 g (NH4)2SO4 was added to the above solution. A piece of CC (1 cm × 3 cm) was pretreated by acetone and ethanol and then immersed into the above tungstic acid solution, the autoclave was heated to 180 °C for 16 h. After that, the blue tungstic precursor coated CC was taken out and rinsed with deionized water and ethanol for several times and dried at 60 °C under vacuum for 1 h. The obtained tungstic precursor was then annealed under inert gas at 450 °C for 1 h with the heating rate and gas speed of 10 °/min and 40 sccm, respectively. The final products of urchin-like CC@WO3 were obtained."
4,Preparation of CC@WO3/Ru SAs,"2.3 Preparation of CC@WO3/Ru SAs The CC@WO3/Ru SAs was obtained by a galvanostatic deposition method. 3.5 mL (10 mg/mL) RuCl3·xH2O was dissolved in 50 mL aqueous solution containing 150 mg H3NO3S. The Ru3+ solution was stirred for 10 min and used as electrolyte to plate Ru SAs. The CC@WO3 (0.5 cm × 0.5 cm) and high purity graphite rod were used as working and counter electrodes, respectively. The cathodic current density was controlled to 0.2 mA cm–2. The mass loading of Ru SAs on CC@WO3 was depended on the galvanostatic deposition time, while the reaction time was changed as needed (225, 450, 700, and 900 s, respectively)."
5,Preparation of CC@Ru,2.4 Preparation of CC@Ru The CC@Ru was prepared with the same procedure as CC@WO3/Ru SAs without the addition of WO3.
6,Preparation of Urchin-like CC@WO3@Ru NPs,"2.5 Preparation of Urchin-like CC@WO3@Ru NPs The WO3@Ru NPs were obtained by the chemical reduction method. Typically, WO3 was prepared with the same method as CC@WO3 without the addition of CC. The obtained WO3 powder was dispersed in the deionized water (15 mL). Subsequently, the RuCl3·xH2O aqueous solution (10 mg/mL) was added to the above WO3 suspension and stirred for 10 min to form WO3/Ru3+ solution. The appropriate amount of NaBH4 solution (10 mg/mL) as reductant was dropped slowly to the WO3/Ru3+ solution and then continually stirred overnight. Finally, the grey WO3/Ru NPs suspension was centrifuged and washed by deionized water and ethanol several times and dried at 60 °C under vacuum for 1 h. The loading of Ru NPs in WO3 was controlled the same as WO3/Ru SAs. The obtained WO3/Ru NPs powder was re-dispersed in ethanol that containing Nafion binder and coating on the CC. The loading of WO3/Ru NPs on CC was same as the CC@WO3/Ru SAs."
7,Structural characterizations,"2.6 Structural characterizations The powder X-ray diffraction of the samples were performed by a Rigaku Smart LAB SE with Cu Kα radiation. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was conducted by a Thermo Scientific Nexsa and the data were calibrated by a carbon source of C 1s at 284.6 eV [24,25]. The Fourier transform infrared spectrum was measured using an IRAffinity-1S by the KBr flakiness technique. The ultraviolet–visible (UV-Vis) diffuse reflectance spectrum was carried out on a Shimadzu UV-2600. The direct band gap of the catalysts was determined by extrapolating the rising part of the equation (hυ·f(R))2 or (hυ·f(R))1/2 versus photon energy hυ in the unit of eV. Where the f(R) comes from the Kubelka-Munk function as f(R) = (1 − R)2/(2R) [26,27]. The morphological characterization of the samples were performed by a scanning electron microscope (ZEISS Sigma HV). Transmission electron microscopy, high angle annular dark field, and elemental mappings were performed by a FEI Talos F200X operated at 200 kV. Atomic phases of Ru SAs in WO3 were determined by a FEI Titan Cubed Themis G2 300 with spherical aberration correctors. The content of Ru SAs was determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, PerkinElmer Optima 2100DV). The content of WO3/Ru on CC was determined by a Thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA, SDT-Q600, TA Instruments) with a heating rate of 10 °C min–1."
8,Electrochemical measurements,"2.7 Electrochemical measurements The HER activity and stability tests were measured using an electrochemical workstation (CHI760E, CH Instruments) and coupled with three-electrode cell system. The self-assembling CC@WO3/Ru SAs and other referenced samples were utilized as working electrodes. Saturated calomel electrode and Hg/HgO electrode (1.0 M KOH filler) were used as reference electrodes in acid (0.5 M H2SO4)/neutral (1.0 M PBS) and alkaline (1.0 M KOH) media, respectively. The high-purity graphite rod was counter electrode. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was tested at a scan rate of 2.0 mV/s. Tafel slope was obtained according to the equation η = blog(j) + a, where b is the Tafel slope. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) was estimated by the electrochemical double layer capacitance (C dl) that was calculated from the cyclic voltammetry upon various scan rates under non-faradic potential rages. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was obtained at 200 mV from 105 to 102 Hz. The stability of the samples was evaluated by chronopotentiometry at a current density of –10 mA cm–2. All the potential in this work were converted to reversible hydrogen electrode based on the equations: E RHE = E SCE + 0.059 × pH + 0.242, E RHE = E Hg/HgO + 0.059 × pH + 0.098. As for the coupled system of HER and HzOR, a non-reinforced AEM was used as the solid electrolyte. The CC@WO3/Ru-450 or Pt wire (Φ = 0.5 mm) were both anode and cathode electrodes. The 1.0 M KOH and 1.0 M KOH/0.5 M N2H4 were added into cathode and anode sides, respectively. While the 1.0 M KOH was replaced by 1.0 M PBS when testing neutral HzOR-assisted OWS. During the reaction process, a voltage window for LSV was 0–1 V for HzOR-assisted OWS and 0∼2 V for bare OWS. The LSV curves with the scan rate of 5.0 mV/s in the coupled system were recorded. All the data were IR-corrected according to the eq: E compensated = E measured – IR s, where the R s is the solution resistance based on the EIS test [28]."
9,Results and Discussions,
10,Morphological and structural characterizations of the samples,"3.1 Morphological and structural characterizations of the samples The form of Ru in WO3 was preliminarily determined by the X-ray diffraction (XRD). CC@WO3 reveals the crystalline WO3 (JCPDS no. 85–2460) (Fig. 1 a). After the Ru SAs decoration, no other peaks are observed except for the WO3, preliminary confirming the atom-scale rather than metallic or oxides of Ru, whereas the (200) plane of CC@WO3/Ru-450 (the deposition time was 450 s as noted) slightly shifts toward the lower angle compared with CC@WO3 due to the lattice expansion that resulting from the incorporation of Ru SAs in the Vo (Fig. 1b). The morphology evolution and isolation of Ru SAs in Vo-WO3 was further evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). As shown in Fig. 1c, the SEM image of CC@WO3 exhibits urchin-like nanostructure that are uniformly dispersed on the CC. The TEM and high-resolution (HR) TEM image show the average diameter of WO3 NWs is ∼80 nm and lattice distance of 0.38 nm, corresponding to the (002) plane of WO3 (Fig. 1d and Fig. S1, Supporting Information). Further, the high-angle circular dark field scanning transmission microscope (HAADF-STEM) mapping of CC@WO3 verifies the existence of W and O (Fig. 1e). In addition, the SEM and TEM images of CC@WO3/Ru-450 SAs show the same urchin-like morphology as CC@WO3 without any nanoparticles or clusters formation (Fig. 1f, Fig. S2) but introducing abundant defects and disordered areas by electrochemical etching during galvanostatic deposition of Ru SAs (Fig. 1g). The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum shows the signal of g=1.999 for CC@WO3/Ru SAs and higher resonance signal than CC@WO3, indicating more Vo in CC@WO3/Ru-450 SAs (Fig. S3) [29]. The slight increase of the amount of Vo after the galvanostatic immobilization of ruthenium single atoms is attributed to the assistance of an external negative electrical field during the electrodeposition process [30]. The HAADF-STEM image and elemental mappings of WO3/Ru-450 indicate the uniformly dispersed Ru signals on the WO3, preliminarily confirming the existence of Ru SAs (Fig. S4). The aberration-corrected (AC) HAADF-STEM of WO3/Ru-450 shows that numerous separated bright spots are homogeneously dispersed, which are the W atoms because of the larger atomic number of W than Ru (Fig. 1h). Therefore, the Ru SAs are hardly observed in the lattice of WO3. However, when taking closer insight to the enlarged AC HAADF-STEM of WO3/Ru-450, we can see that the lattice distance of (100) plane (0.65 nm) in WO3/Ru SAs expanded compared to that of standard WO3 (0.63 nm), which may be attributed to the dopant of Ru atoms in Vo of WO3 (Fig. 1i). Moreover, the magnified image and intensity profile (Fig. 1j) indicates that the Ru atom are immobilized at the Vo positions, this result is in accordance with the XRD analysis (Fig. 1b). The loading of WO3 on CC was determined as 24.4% (4.98 mg cm–2) by TGA analysis (Fig. S5). Because of the trace amount of Ru SAs in WO3, the ICP-OES was used to further determine the loading of Ru SAs in WO3/Ru [31–33]. The loading of Ru SAs was determined to 0.6 wt% (30 μg cm–2) based on the ICP-OES results, and the total mass of WO3/Ru on carbon cloth is 5.01 mg cm–2. The HAADF-STEM elemental mappings and EDS spectrum of such area were performed to further confirm that the Ru SAs are confined uniformly in the Vo of WO3 (Fig. 1k and Fig. S6, S7). The local chemical environment and electronic configuration between Ru SAs and WO3 is elucidated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The survey spectra show the coexistence of W, O, and Ru without other impurity elements (Fig. 2 a). The high-resolution XPS spectra of W 4f signal for CC@WO3 shows two peaks at the binding energies (BEs) of 35.8 and 37.9 eV, corresponding to the W–O in the WO3 (Fig. 2b) [9]. For CC@WO3/Ru-450 SAs, a slightly shift to lower BEs (ca. 0.5 eV) is observed, which is due to the partial electron transfer from Vo to W sites as evidenced by the charge density difference analysis below. Fig. 2c shows the Ru 3d and C 1s signals, the peak at the BE of 282.0 eV is assigned to Ruδ+ in Ru SAs, while the CC@WO3 supported Ru nanoparticles (CC@WO3@Ru NPs) shows the peak located at 280.4 eV, which is identified as Ru0, implying the successful isolation of Ru SAs in WO3 [34]. The other peaks at 284.6 and 286.1 eV could be assigned to the C=C and C–O species originated from the CC/adventitious carbon and air, respectively [9]. The O 1s spectra of CC@WO3 are shown in Fig. 2d. The major peak at 530.6 eV is attributed to the lattice oxygen, while the other small peak at 532.0 eV is assigned to surface oxygen vacancies [35]. Notably, the peak intensity of Vo in CC@WO3/Ru-450 is higher than that of CC@WO3, indicating more Vo density in CC@WO3/Ru-450, which is further confirmed by the valance bond spectra. As shown in Fig. 2e, a small peak immediately at ∼1.5 eV in CC@WO3 (within the dotted box) is assigned to the existence of Vo. However, a much higher peak observed at ∼3.0 eV in CC@WO3/Ru-450 likely contains a higher amount of Vo than CC@WO3 [36,37]. The Raman spectra is conducted to reveal the structure feature of WO3 and WO3/Ru SAs (Fig. 2f). The bands at 254 and 326 cm–1 corresponds to the O–W–O bending vibration modes and other peaks at 696 and 812 cm–1, assignable to the O–W–O stretching vibration modes. The relative lower peak intensity of WO3/Ru SAs in comparison with those of WO3, further indicating the formation of Vo [38]. The FTIR spectra in Fig. 2g demonstrate that all the CC@WO3 and CC@WO3/Ru-450 show three distinct peaks at 598, 772, and 1543 cm–1, the first two peaks correspond to the stretching vibration of W–O–W in WO3, while the third peak is assigned to C=O stretching vibration in bridging ligands [39,40]. The UV-Vis spectra of CC@WO3 and CC@WO3/Ru-450 are shown in Fig. 2h. The diffuse reflectance spectra of CC@WO3/Ru-450 exhibits distinct changes in absorption sharp edge and enhanced absorption in range of 450–750 nm, which is thought to be induced by Vo in CC@WO3/Ru-450. The corresponding Tauc plots calculated by Kubelka-Munk function (calculation details are shown in the experimental section) reveal the indirect band gaps of 2.1 and 2.7 eV for CC@WO3/Ru-450 and CC@WO3, respectively. This significant difference may be attributed to more Vo in CC@WO3/Ru-450, which increases the bond length of W–O, decreases the bonding antibonding interaction, and therefore gives rise smaller band gap [27]."
11,"Electrochemical HER performance of the samples under acid, alkaline, and neutral media","3.2 Electrochemical HER performance of the samples under acid, alkaline, and neutral media The precondition of a good electrocatalyst for pH-universal HzOR-assisted OWS should exhibit both superior HER and HzOR activity over a broad pH range. In view of this, we firstly evaluated the electrochemical HER performance of CC@WO3/Ru SAs in 0.5 M H2SO4. For comparison, commercial Pt wire, CC@WO3, and CC@Ru-450 were introduced. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the polarization curves of CC@WO3/Ru-450 reveals remarkable HER performance with an overpotential at –10 mA cm–2 (η 10) of as low as 17 mV, which is much lower than those of Pt wire (31 mV), CC@Ru-450 (180 mV), and CC@WO3 (225 mV). Fig. 3b shows that the Tafel slope for CC@WO3/Ru-450 is 54.7 mV dec–1, which is closed to the Pt wire (32.4 mV dec–1). A comparison of Tafel slope for CC@WO3/Ru-450 with CC@Ru-450 (126.4 mV dec–1) and CC@WO3 (192.2 mV dec–1) suggesting the faster kinetic reacting rate of CC@WO3/Ru-450. The small charge transfer resistance (R ct) of CC@WO3/Ru-450 in comparison to that of CC@WO3 obtained from electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS, Fig. 3c) further indicates its faster charge transfer kinetics and electron transport in HER [22]. The excellent electrocatalytic performance of CC@WO3/Ru-450 outperforms most of the reported W- and Ru-based catalysts in acid medium (Fig. 3d, Table S1, Supporting Information). In order to explore the effect of amount of Ru SAs on the performance of HER, we prepared the CC@WO3/Ru SAs with different deposition time (225, 450, 700, and 900 s). As shown in Fig. 3e, CC@WO3/Ru-450 shows the lowest overpotential of 76 mV at –100 mA cm–2 (η 100), which is much better than those of CC@WO3/Ru-225 (203 mV), CC@WO3/Ru-700 (171 mV), and CC@WO3/Ru-900 (199 mV). A lower Ru SAs loading may expose insufficient active sites while an excess of Ru SAs loading induces the aggregation of Ru SAs to nanoclusters or even nanoparticles, which significantly decreases the HER activity (Fig. S8) [22]. The HER performance of CC@WO3@Ru NPs was tested to reveal the superiority of Ru SAs, the corresponding characterizations are shown in Fig. S9–S11. The LSV curves show an overpotential of 39 mV at –10 mA cm–2 for CC@WO3@Ru NPs in 0.5 M H2SO4, which is inferior to that of CC@WO3/Ru-450, indicating the formation of Ru NPs in WO3 decreases the active sites numbers compared with WO3/Ru SAs. The ECSA was calculated by the electrochemical double layer capacitance (C dl) [41]. As shown in Fig. S12, C dl of CC@WO3/Ru-450 is 15.1 mF cm–2, which is much higher than CC@WO3 (10.4 mF cm–2), suggesting the isolation of Ru SAs in WO3 exposes more active sites due to the created abundant defects and interfaces in the WO3/Ru SAs. The intrinsic activity of CC@WO3/Ru-450 in 0.5 M H2SO4 was evaluated by the mass activity based on the loading of Ru (the calculation details was provided in Supporting Information). As shown in Fig. 3f, CC@WO3/Ru-450 exhibits remarkably higher mass activity compared to CC@Ru-450, which due to the aggregation of Ru SAs to larger nanoparticles without the confined effect of defective WO3 in CC@Ru-450 (Fig. S13). The turnover frequency (TOF) was further performed by electrochemical method [42]. The number of active sites (n) should be determined before calculating the TOF (s–1) values of the catalysts. The CV were conducted in the voltage ranges of –0.2∼0.6 V at a scan rate (v) of 50 mV s–1 in 1.0 M PBS solution (pH = 7). Assuming one electron reduction and oxidation process, the number of active sites are calculated from the equation: n = SA 2 v F Where S is integrated charge of CV curves (Fig. S14a), A is geometric surface area, 2 is the number of transferred electrons, F is faraday constant (96,485 C mol–1). Then, the TOF value can be obtained from the equation: T O F = I 2 n F (2) Where I is current (A), 2 is the number of transferred electron, F is faraday constant, and n is the number of active sites. The TOF values of CC@WO3/Ru-450 in 0.5 M H2SO4 is 0.54 s–1 at 100 mV overpotential, which is much larger than CC@WO3@Ru (0.32 s–1) (Fig. S14b). The stability of CC@WO3/Ru-450 was evaluated by the chronopotentiometry curve. As shown in Fig. 3g, CC@WO3/Ru-450 exhibits outstanding stability for at least 100 h without degradation at –10 mA cm–2. The corresponding LSV curves of CC@WO3/Ru-450 shows only a little activity attenuation (Fig. S15a). We also characterized the SEM, TEM, XRD, and XPS of the CC@WO3/Ru-450 after the electrochemical stability test (Fig. 4 ). It can be seen that the morphology of WO3/Ru SAs are unchanged as evidenced by the SEM and TEM images in Fig. 4a–d. The HRTEM images of CC@WO3/Ru-450 exhibits the lattice distance of 0.38 nm, corresponding to the (002) plane of WO3. Meanwhile, the smooth surface of WO3 indicates that the Ru SAs do not aggregate to large nanoclusters, confirming the structure stability of Ru SAs (Fig. 4e). The elemental mappings show homogeneous W, O, and Ru signals covered throughout the WO3/Ru-450 (Fig. 4f). Additionally, no metallic Ru signals and other impurities are detected by the XPS and XRD, further demonstrating the excellent structural stability of CC@WO3/Ru-450 in acid solution (Fig. 4g–j). The HER efficiencies of the CC@WO3/Ru-450 and reference samples were further tested in 1.0 M KOH. As shown in Fig. 5 a, CC@WO3/Ru-450 exhibits the η 10 of 34 mV, which is the same as Pt wire, but the activity of CC@WO3/Ru-450 is superior to Pt wire when exceeding 25 mA cm–2. The comparison of η 10 over CC@WO3 (368 mV) and CC@Ru-450 (mV) suggest the excellent performance of CC@WO3/Ru-450 in alkaline medium, which may originate from the synergy between WO3 and Ru SAs. The role of WO3 and Ru SAs toward alkaline HER was further evaluated by the Tafel plots (Fig. 5b). The alkaline HER pathway of CC@WO3/Ru-450 is certified to be the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism based on the Tafel slope of 57.5 mV dec–1 [43]. The lower Tafel slope of CC@WO3/Ru-450 compared with CC@Ru-450 (74.5 mV dec–1) indicates the WO3 as a concerted catalyst could promote the dissociation of H2O (Volmer step) because Ru is a good catalyst for Heyrovsky step but limits in the cleavage of the H−OH bond in alkaline HER [44]. Therefore, the WO3 is a Volmer promoter and coupled with Ru SAs show excellent alkaline HER activity. The high kinetic rate of CC@WO3/Ru-450 was further estimated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). CC@WO3/Ru-450 shows the smaller charge-transfer resistance (R ct) as compared to CC@WO3, indicating the rapid electron/proton transfer between WO3/Ru and electrolyte (Fig. 5c). The excellent alkaline HER activity of CC@WO3/Ru-450 is comparatively favorable with the recently reported alkaline HER electrocatalysts (Fig. 5d, Table S2). The LSV curves of CC@WO3/Ru SAs with varied deposition time were conducted and shown in Fig. 5e. The CC@WO3/Ru SAs has a dependency relationship with optimal deposition time, the minimum of η 10 was obtained at the deposition time of 450 s, which is in accordance with the discussion in Fig. 3e. The intrinsic activity of CC@WO3/Ru-450 were evaluated by mass activity and TOF (Fig. 5f and Fig. S14c). The CC@WO3/Ru-450 also has larger response current and TOF values than CC@Ru-450 and CC@WO3@Ru NPs, further proving its excellent alkaline HER activity. In addition, the LSV curves of CC@WO3@Ru NPs was performed to reveal the superiority of Ru SAs with ∼100% atom utilization (Fig. S10). As expected, the η 10 of CC@WO3@Ru NPs is 35 mV higher than CC@WO3/Ru-450, suggesting the Ru SAs in WO3 exposes more active sites to the greatest extent and delivers highly efficient alkaline HER activity. Furthermore, the chronopotentiometry curve of CC@WO3/Ru-450 was tested and shown in Fig. 5g. The potential obtained at –10 mA cm–2 can be maintained for at least 100 h with negligible attenuation, and the LSV curve after the CP test shows only a little activity degradation (Fig. S15b). The corresponding physical characterizations of CC@WO3/Ru-450 after the stability test are shown in Fig. S16a–c. The unchanged morphology and undetectable metallic Ru indicates that the Ru SAs are steady isolated in the Vo of WO3 without aggregating to nanoclusters, demonstrating the stable structures of CC@WO3/Ru SAs in alkaline medium. Furthermore, the electrochemical HER performances of the samples were investigated and compared in 1.0 M PBS medium to unveil the pH-universality of the CC@WO3/Ru-450. In sharp contrast, the CC@WO3/Ru-450 exhibits the best activity with a lowest overpotential of η 10=64 mV, much lower than those of CC@Ru-450 (265 mV) and CC@WO3 (329 mV) and most of the reported state-of-the-art electrocatalysts in neutral medium (Fig. 6 a and Table S3). The Tafel slopes in Fig. 6b were 91.9, 94.7, and 315.4 mV dec–1 for CC@WO3/Ru-450, CC@Ru-450, and CC@WO3, respectively. The smallest Tafel slope value of CC@WO3/Ru-450 further verifies its remarkable activity towards neutral HER. To get insights into the Ru SAs content toward neutral HER, The LSV curves of CC@WO3/Ru SAs with different Ru SAs deposition time were carried out and shown in Fig. 6c. As the same tendency as those of CC@WO3/Ru SAs in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, The CC@WO3/Ru-450 shows the lowest overpotential as compared to CC@WO3/Ru-225 (127 mV), CC@WO3/Ru-700 (119 mV), and CC@WO3/Ru-900 (214 mV). The intrinsic activity was evaluated by TOF. As shown in Fig. S14d, the CC@WO3/Ru-450 exhibits TOF value of 0.20 s–1 at η=200 mV, which is about twice higher than that of CC@WO3@Ru NPs (0.11 s–1), indicating extra highly active sites for CC@WO3/Ru-450. Long-term testing in the 1.0 M PBS proved the excellent stability of CC@WO3/Ru-450 over 100 h under a current density of –10 mA cm–2, and the corresponding LSV curve after the CP test shows only a little activity degradation (Fig. S15c). The outstanding performance of CC@WO3/Ru-450 is superior to most of the reported state-of-the-art electrocatalysts in neutral environment (Fig. 6d, 6e and Table S3). The crystal structure and morphology of CC@WO3/Ru-450 after the stability test were analyzed. As shown in Fig. S16d–f, the structure and morphology of WO3/Ru SAs is basically unchanged and the Ru SAs are steady confined in the Vo of WO3 since no metallic and oxides of Ru are detected by XRD and XPS, which further proves the excellent stability of CC@WO3/Ru SAs in neutral medium."
12,Electrochemical HzOR performance of the samples under alkaline and neutral media,"3.3 Electrochemical HzOR performance of the samples under alkaline and neutral media Benefiting from the remarkable HER performance over a wide pH range, The HzOR and HzOR-assisted OWS of CC@WO3/Ru-450 under alkaline and neutral media were evaluated, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7 a, a three-electrode system of CC@WO3/Ru-450 in 1.0 M KOH+0.5 M N2H4 were firstly tested, it is obvious that no anodic current density is detected on CC@WO3, whereas the CC@WO3/Ru-450 shows ultralow working potential of –58 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is much lower than that of Pt wire (168 mV) and most of the recently reported state-of-the-art catalysts (Table S4). Also, the HzOR of CC@WO3/Ru-450 was then performed in 1.0 M PBS+0.5 M N2H4. The CC@WO3/Ru-450 became a competitive candidate for HzOR in the neutral environments. As shown in Fig. S17a, the CC@WO3/Ru-450 delivers a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at low potential of 23 mV. For comparison, the counterpart value for Pt wire is 370 mV. Undoubtedly, CC@WO3/Ru-450 offered the powerfully HzOR activity than Pt and reported reference [45]. The superior HzOR activity of CC@WO3/Ru-450 mainly due to the electronic configuration between Ru SAs and WO3, which leads to the electropositivity of W sites and tends to accelerate the oxidation of N2H4, and improves the HzOR activity. In addition, the atomic dispersed Ru SAs on WO3 could maximize of the exposure of metal atoms to the outer environment, and the electronic metal–support interactions could be well achieved between Ru and W active sites to modulate adsorption/desorption behavior in HzOR synergistically through the electron configuration [46,47]."
13,HzOR-assisted OWS performance of the samples under alkaline and neutral media,"3.4 HzOR-assisted OWS performance of the samples under alkaline and neutral media Encouraged by the splendid pH-universal HER and HzOR of CC@WO3/Ru-450, the HzOR-assisted OWS system were built in a two-electrode electrolyzer using 1.0 M KOH//1.0 M KOH+0.5 M N2H4 or 1.0 M PBS//1.0 M PBS+0.5 M N2H4 as the electrolyte. The CC@WO3/Ru-450 or reference samples were both anode and cathode. As displayed in Fig. 7b, only an ultralow cell voltage of 25 mV is applied to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for CC@WO3/Ru-450 in 1.0 M KOH+0.5 M N2H4, which is superior to Pt wire (336 mV) and far beyond bare OWS on CC@WO3/Ru-450 (1.58 V). Such outstanding HzOR-assisted OWS activity of CC@WO3/Ru-450 compares favorably with the behavior of majority of the reported state-of-the-art catalysts in alkaline medium (Fig. 7e and Table S5). In addition, under neutral condition, the HzOR-assisted OWS system on CC@WO3/Ru-450 offers a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a cell voltage of 137 mV in 1.0 M PBS+0.5 M N2H4, which is, as expected, much lower than that of Pt wire (638 mV), bare OWS on CC@WO3/Ru-450 (1.55 V) (Fig. 7c), and reported few references (eg. Rh2S3/NC, 286 mV) [45]. Furthermore, the CC@WO3/Ru-450 maintains high stability during HzOR-assisted OWS electrolysis under alkaline and neutral solution, and shows insignificant performance attenuation (Fig. 7d, Fig. S17b). The corresponding LSV test after the CP test shows only a little activity attenuation (Fig. S18). Subsequently, the structure of the CC@WO3/Ru-450 after the alkaline and neutral HzOR-assisted OWS test was studied. XRD patterns of CC@WO3/Ru-450 still reveals pure phase of WO3 without any Ru oxides or metallic phases, preliminarily indicating that the Ru SAs were stable in the Vo of WO3 (Fig. S19). The morphological stability of the catalysts was then evaluated, the urchin-like WO3/Ru SAs can be well maintained after the HzOR-assisted OWS in alkaline and neutral media (Fig. S20a, S20b). The TEM images further demonstrate the morphologic and structural stability of WO3/Ru SAs, as evidenced by the observed intact WO3/Ru SAs NWs and homogeneous dispersed of W, O, and Ru signals throughout the WO3/Ru SAs NWs (Fig. S20c–f)."
14,DFT calculations,"3.5 DFT calculations To render further fundamental insights into the excellent HER and HzOR performance of WO3/Ru SAs, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed by building the optimized model structure of Vo-WO3/Ru SAs with one Ru atom isolated in one Vo of WO3. For comparison, pristine WO3 and Vo-WO3 with one Vo were also constructed (Fig. 8 a). The charge density difference of Vo-WO3 shows that the charge density decreased in the Vo of WO3 and the electrons localized to the neighbor W sites (Fig. 8b). After the immobilization of Ru atom, the charge density around the Ru site would be redistributed, it reveals that the electrons are mainly transferred from Vo sites to adjacent Ru sites and the small fraction of electrons are moved to neighboring W site. The electron-sufficient Ru sites might be active centers to appropriately adsorb reaction intermediates in acid medium [48]. While in the alkaline and neutral solution, the oxygen atoms in water molecule can be easier captured by the electron-deficient W sites during the Volmer reaction and the produced H* are migrated to nearby Ru sites to form H2 [48]. We further compared the partial density of states (DOS) of surface W atoms for WO3, Vo-WO3, and Vo-WO3/Ru SAs. The d-band center is an efficient descriptor to evaluate the bonding strength between metal and adsorbate. According to the d-band theory, the lower value of d-band center leads to weaker bonding strength between the catalysts and adsorbates [49]. As shown in Fig. 8c, the d-band center in Vo-WO3 (–4.133 eV) is much lower than that of WO3 (–3.252 eV). After the immobilization of Ru SAs in the Vo of WO3, the Vo-WO3/Ru SAs shows the d-band center value of –5.180 eV. The downward-shifted d-band center of Vo-WO3/Ru SAs compared with Vo-WO3 indicates the weakened H* bonding strength which facilitates the desorption of H* from the surface and promotes HER [50]. To further understand the origin of superb HER activity of Vo-WO3/Ru SAs, the free energy of hydrogen atom adsorption energy (ΔGH*) on WO3, Vo-WO3, and Vo-WO3/Ru SAs with some potential Vo sites (Fig. 8d and Fig. S21). The ΔGH* is an important descriptor to evaluate HER, and a high HER catalytic activity is anticipated if ΔGH* is close to 0 eV [51]. It reveals that the ΔGH* of Vo-WO3/Ru SAs is increased to –0.27 eV, which is closed to the Pt (111) plane of –0.09 eV and much lower than those of WO3 (–3.17 eV), Vo-WO3 (–1.76 eV), Vo2-WO3/Ru SAs(–0.97 eV), and Vo3-WO3/Ru SAs (–0.83 eV) [52]. The optimized ΔGH* of the Vo-WO3/Ru SAs can significantly weaken the adsorption energy of H* to thermal neutral of ΔGH*, which is in line with the PDOS analysis. The unique features of single Ru atoms immobilized in defective WO3 with well-defined WO3/Ru interfaces show remarkable pH-universal HER and HzOR. Such bifunctional and wide pH range features make WO3/Ru SAs as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for both alkaline and neutral HzOR-assisted OWS, as illustrated in Fig. 8e. Notably, the synergistic interaction of WO3/Ru interfaces plays a critical role in accelerating HER and HzOR. When hydrogen evolution occurs in acid medium, H+ plays the main role in the whole process, because the water dissociation step would no longer be the bottleneck for HER [53]. In this case, the H* came from the H3O+ migrates to electron-sufficient Ru SAs active sites that is induced by electron redistribution from Vo to Ru sites to promote hydrogen production. While the HER mechanism on WO3/Ru SAs in alkaline/neutral condition is more complex, the sluggish water dissociation of Volmer kinetic on bare Ru limits the HER, but the synergistic interaction of the WO3/Ru could significantly improve HER kinetic rate by lowering the barrier of Volmer step. Typically, due to the electron redistribution between Ru and W sites, the electron-deficient W sites of WO3 could substantially facilitate Volmer step by cleaving H2O into H* and stabilize OH– to prevent them from blocking H* adsorption sites [54]. Meanwhile, the Ru atom sites with enriched electron would significantly enhance the recombination of H* to form H2 [48]. Moreover, the excellent HzOR performance over WO3/Ru SAs is mainly attributed to the precise location of Ru SAs adjacent to the Vo sites that induces the electronic configuration to increase the electropositivity of W relative to Ru sites because of the higher electronegativity of Ru (2.0) than W (1.6) atom and leads to the more electron transfer from Vo to Ru than W sites (Fig. 8b) [55], and the electron-deficient W sites would facilitate the adsorption of the of intermediates of HzOR [4,56]. Therefore, the isolation of Ru SAs in the Vo of WO3 significantly improves the HzOR and pH-universal HER activity of WO3, which is in accordance with the experimental results. It is worthy to note that the precise control of the deposition of Ru SAs into the Vo of WO3 by facile galvanostatic strategy could also account for the remarkable performance of pH-universal HER and HzOR as well as alkaline/neutral HzOR-assisted OWS on CC@WO3/Ru SAs through providing much more open sites and maximizing the density of active sites."
15,Conclusions,"In summary, the single Ru atoms isolated in urchin-like Vo-WO3 on conductive CC substrate was firstly designed and synthesized by a facile one-pot galvanostatic deposition method, and applied it as bifunctional electrocatalysts for ultrahigh pH-universal HER and HzOR activity. Concretely, it shows low overpotentials of 17, 34, and 64 mV at –10 mA cm–2 under acid, alkaline, and neutral HER, respectively, and exhibits long stability for at least 100 h. In addition, it can deliver a current density of 10 mA cm–2 at ultralow potentials of –58 and 23 mV under alkaline and neutral HzOR, respectively. Remarkably, the HzOR-assisted OWS system using CC@WO3/Ru SAs as both anode and cathode catalysts in H-type electrolyzer only requires ultralow cell voltages of 25 and 137 mV to achieve distinct alkaline and neutral hydrogen evolution (10 mA cm–2), respectively, surpassing those of platinum and most of the recently reported state-of-the-art catalysts. Theoretical calculations of the reaction mechanism indicate that the single Ru atom sites would readily interact with adjacent W sites around the oxygen defects and induce charge redistribution between Ru and W as well as regulate the local electron structures, which significantly optimize hydrogen free energy, foster the O–H dissociation steps, and stabilize intermediates during pH-universal HER and HzOR. Our work presented facile synthetic strategy of SACs on defective oxides as bifunctional electrocatalysts for a wide pH range of energy-efficient hydrazine oxidation-assisted overall water splitting."
