0,Introduction,"Over the past decades, extensive research effort has been put in the catalytic hydrogenation due to its great industrial and scientific significance in the important fields of petrochemical refining, fine chemical production and environ-contamination control [1]. Developing highly efficient catalysts not only can promote the progress of chemical industrial but also can alleviate the stress raised by the environmental pollution. There have been many reported metal catalysts applied for hydrogenation, including noble metals of Pt [2], Pd [3], Au [4] and Ru [5] with intriguing performance. However, the scarcity and high cost hinder their practical applications. Even though scientists have paid great effort on developing free-noble transition metal catalysts, such as iron, cobalt [6], nickel [7], copper [8] and etc., it is unfortunate that the reactions catalyzed by the cheap transition metals often require high temperature or high pressure to activate the catalytic centers, which inevitably results in the metal aggregation or leaching [9], and severely deactivation consequently. To overcome these limitations, many modified strategies have been adopted, such as support modification [10], metal alloy [11], ligand anchor [12], space entrapment [13–15] and etc. For example, Dumesic et al. have engineered a mesoporous aluminum overcoat to stabilize a copper metal catalyst by atomic layer deposition route [16]. Zhao et al. have prepared a highly efficient CZA-oa@H-ZSM-5 capsule-structured bi-functional catalyst by coating an H-ZSM-5 shell on millimeter-sized copper–zinc–aluminum oxalate, which exhibited high activity for DME production from syngas [17]. Although great progress has been achieved, the metal sintering and leaching are still a great challenge for the free noble metal catalysts, therefore it is still highly desirable to develop an effectively method to synthesize highly dispersed and robust catalysts. In the conventional preparation route for the heterogeneous catalysts, generally the active metal components are loaded on the selected support via ex situ manner, e.g., impregnation or co-precipitation method [18–20], and then transformed into metallic/oxide active phase by calcination. Unfortunately, the obtained active components are susceptible to aggregation owing to the relatively weak metal-support interactions. This mainly originates from two factors: i) the metal ions precursors are mixed with the support solids in the form of heterogeneous phase; ii) calcination of metal ions on the pre-formed support unavoidably leads to the phase aggregation and weakened metal-support interaction. To solve these issues, the approaches used in [21] or [22] are effective: both metal ions and support precursors are homogeneously mixed into a gel or other hybridized form, and in situ transformed into the active metal phase and support solids simultaneously, the phase aggregation and leaching would be controllably minimized due to the intensified metal-support interactions [21]. Faro Jr and co-workers have reported a copper-manganese catalyst by in situ calcination of layered-double hydroxides based on copper, manganese, and aluminum for methanol synthesis. They credited the smaller Cu crystallites and larger copper surface area to the larger surface area of its oxide precursor [22].Additionally, porosity initiators can be easily introduced into the hybridized composites together with the metal ions, leading to produce the meso/macropores, which are beneficial to mass transportation and reaction accesses to the active centers [23]. Above considerations promoted us to propose a robust strategy of homogeneously hybridizing the silica with metal-organic framework (MOF) composite to obtain a highly dispersed and stable metal catalyst. The copper benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate (Cu3(BTC)2), as known as HKUST-1 [24], can be selected as both mesopore initiator and Cu ion precursor, and the silica played as inorganic skeleton to disperse and stabilize the copper species. Yao and co-authors have once used the preformed HKUST-1 as copper precursor to prepare a Cu/SiO2 catalyst [25]. They disclosed that the remove of BTC can make the copper effectively escape from silica coating and attain excellent performance for dimethyl oxalate hydrogenation. However, there still lacks study on the correlation between the metal and silica underlying the robust stability. Herein, we developed a facile one pot synthesized route by fine control of the hydrolysis of silica and coordination between the Cu ions and 1, 3, 5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (BTC), a Cu-BTC#SiO2 was simultaneously hybridized, and further calcination in situ yielded the mesoporous silica supported highly dispersed copper oxide nanoparticles catalyst. We found that the introduced silica content influenced remarkably the hybridized form by controlling the growth of Cu3(BTC)2 crystallite size, and the homogeneously hybridization caused an intensified metal-support interaction, which can regulate both the copper particle size and reducibility. We further optimized the silica contents to elucidate the optimized balance between the metal dispersion and reducible properties for catalyst design."
1,Experiment section,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation All chemicals were purchased commercially (Aladdin, China) and used without further purification. In a typical synthetic process for the hybrid composite Cu-BTC#SiO2, firstly 0.25 g 1, 3, 5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (BTC) and 1 g tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) were dissolved in 10 ml ethanol. Then, 0.25 g cupric nitrate hydrate (Cu(NO3)2•3H2O) was dissolved in 10 ml deionized water and added into the mixed solution. The final mixture contained components with molar ratio of Cu: BTC: TEOS: EtOH: H2O = 1:1.15:4.32:166:537. The mixture was stirred for 30 min and transferred into a Teflon lined autoclave for hydrothermal treatment at 150 °C for 24 h. The as-obtained hybridized gel was collected and dried at 60 °C overnight, denoted as Cu-BTC#SiO2. Finally, the as-prepared Cu-BTC#SiO2 sample was placed in a muffle furnace and calcinated at 400 °C for 4 h to obtain mesoporous silica supported copper oxide catalyst, denoted as CuO#SiO2. To investigate the effect of silica content, we prepared a series of samples using the similar procedure except for various addition of TEOS, and denoted them as CuO#SiO2-s-n, where the n stands for the mass of TEOS addition (unit, gram). For comparison, the pristine Cu-BTC, were prepared without the addition of TEOS, two reference catalysts, CuO/SiO2-sol and CuO/SiO2-im were prepared by various conventional strategies, and the experiment detail and catalyst specifications can be seen in the Experimental and Table S1 in Supporting Information. All related specified sample information can be seen the Table 1 ."
3,Structure characterizations,"2.2 Structure characterizations Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out with a STA409PC thermogravimetric analyser (Netzsch, German). The temperature range was 30–800 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min in a nitrogen atmosphere (25 mL/min). Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) were conducted on a Tensor 27 spectrometer (Bruker, USA) in the range of 400–4000 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1 to obtain IR spectra of the sample. The determined powder samples were mixed with 2 wt% KBr. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained with a D/Max-IIIA X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) using Cu Kα radiation. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was done using an S-4800 FESEM (Hitachi, Japan) to observe morphological and structural analysis. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out on a JEM-2010 microscope (JEOL, Japan) using an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured with a Tristar 3010 isothermal nitrogen sorption analyzer (Micromeritics, USA) using a continuous adsorption procedure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with an AXIS Ultra DLD (Kratos, Britain) to examine the electronic properties of catalysts. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was performed on Auto Chem II 2920 instrument (Micromeritics, USA) equipped with a TCD. All the H2-TPR experiments were conducted with a 10 vol% H2/He mixture (50 cm3 min−1) (a heating rate of 5 °C min−1). Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was conducted on OPTIMA 8000DV (PerkinElmer, USA) to determine the copper content. Raman measurement was carried out using a Raman spec-troscope (HORIBA Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR). Scans were taken over an extended range (100−1000 cm-1), and the exposure time was 20 s."
4,Catalyst evaluation,"2.3 Catalyst evaluation Studies on the furfural hydrogenation were performed in a 25 ml autoclave (CF-0.05, HONGYI Instrument). In a typical experiment, 2 mmol furfural (FF) and 50 mg (0.10 mmol Cu) catalyst were dispersed in 10 ml ethanol, and transferred into the autoclave equipped with pressure gauge. The autoclave was sealed, purged with H2 four times, and then pressurized with H2 to the required pressure. The autoclave was heated to the required temperature and the reaction was left for the required time. A certain amount of octane was then added as an internal standard substance. The products after reaction were analyzed by GC (Shimadzu GC-2-14C, FID) with a DM-WAX column (30 m ×0.32 mm ×0.25 μm) and GC–MS (Thermal Trace GC Ultra with a Polaris Q ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a TR-5MS capillary column). Average reaction rate (r) is defined as the mol of FF consumed per mol metal site per hour, metal sites refer to the total amount of Cu sites determined by ICP-OES. The activation value was determined based on the reaction rates measured in the initial 10 min."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Hybridization of Cu3(BTC)2 and silica,"3.1 Hybridization of Cu3(BTC)2 and silica The simultaneous hybridization route of Cu3(BTC)2 and silica is depicted in Fig. 1 . Firstly, the BTC ligand, Cu(NO3)2 and TEOS are mixed together in a mixed solvent (ethanol and deionized water with volume ratio 1:1). During the sol-gel process, the BTC coordinates with Cu ions to form Cu3(BTC)2 crystallite, while the TEOS simultaneously give rise to the silicate framework by hydrolysis and condensation to entrap the Cu3(BTC)2 particles. To accelerate the formation rate of hybridized gel, the as-prepared mixture is undergoing hydrothermal treatment at 150 °C for 24 h. Such hybridization process could effectively constrain the growth of Cu3(BTC)2 particles sizes. The as-obtained hybridized gel, Cu-BTC#SiO2, is calcinated in the muffle oven, where the node Cu ions, silicate and the BTC linkers yield the CuO particles, silica skeleton and mesopores, respectively. A mesoporous silica supported copper nanoparticles catalyst, CuO#SiO2, is obtained finally. We found that the TEOS concentration strongly influenced the appearance, or hybridization degree of the Cu-BTC#SiO2 composite, as shown in Fig. 2 . The pristine Cu-BTC presents blue sediment with a clear solid-liquid interface. Increasing the TEOS concentration, the blue precipitate become more loosely for the hybridized samples from Cu-BTC#SiO2 -s0.1 to Cu-BTC#SiO2-s0.5. As for the Cu-BTC#SiO2-s1 with molar ratio of Si/Cu = 4.3, it displays as homogeneous blue gel. Therefore, the difference in the hybridized form should be associated with the crystallite sizes of Cu3(BTC)2. The introduced silica can hinder the growth of Cu3(BTC)2 crystallite and help the formation of homogeneously hybridized gel. These results suggest that hybridization of Cu3(BTC)2 and silica can be obtained by the co-assembly of TEOS, Cu(NO3)2 and BTC."
7,Structure characterizations,"3.2 Structure characterizations Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of the as-prepared samples. The pristine Cu-BTC presents octahedron morphology with particle size of ∼10 μm. While the Cu-BTC#SiO2-s0.5 shows irregular bulk morphology, suggesting the silica addition can influence the growth of morphology. The corresponding STEM images (Fig. 4 ) display uniformly dispersed elements including C, Si, O and Cu, suggesting the homogeneously hybridization between the Cu3(BTC)2 and SiO2. Before calcination, we conducted the thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) for the pristine Cu-BTC and Cu-BTC#SiO2-s0.5. As shown in Fig. 5 a, the Cu-BTC presents two prominent weight loss steps in the temperature range of 50–550 °C in nitrogen. The initial weight loss (18 wt%) up to 100 °C is due to the desorption of physically adsorbed water or guest molecules. The sample shows negligible weight change up to 330 °C and then starts to lose its weight of 32 %, which can be assigned to the total degradation of BTC linker [26]. Another weight loss of 12 % is observed between 400 and 800 °C, assigning to the dehydrogenation and further carbonization of organic residue [27]. For the Cu-BTC#SiO2-s0.5, it displays relatively small weight loss of 8 and 24 %, respectively, due to the relative low content of Cu3(BTC)2. Correspondingly, the Cu-BTC displays a sharper derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) peak than the Cu-BTC#SiO2 -s0.5 at ∼360 °C. The TG results indicate the presence of Cu3(BTC)2 and the fact that the organic linker can be eliminated at 400 °C. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of Cu-BTC#SiO2 calcinated at various temperatures were measured using KBr disks and shown in Fig. 5b. Several functional groups of the expected structure can be observed with corresponding infrared absorption peaks. A broadened peak formation at 3100–3600 cm−1 in the catalyst indicates the hydroxyl group from loosely bound water molecules, which decreases upon the calcination temperature. The peak at 1720 cm−1, related to the presence of acidic carboxyl group [28], diminishes at temperature higher than 300 °C. The characteristic vibrations at 1647, 1452 and 1370 cm−1 corresponds to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the carboxylate groups in BTC, respectively [29]. These adsorption bands disappear at 400 °C as well, indicating that the BTC linkers are hydrolyzed in the temperature of 400 °C. In addition, the peak centered at 730 cm−1 might be attributed to Cu–O stretching vibration, in which the oxygen atom is coordinated with Cu [28]. This peak is kept constant till 300 °C, then diminishes at 400 °C. It demonstrates that the calcination temperature influence the formation of Cu species. The peaks at 798 and 960 cm−1 can be attributed to the Si-O-Si stretching [30], which became stronger upon the increased temperature, confirming the formation of silica. The crystallinity of the as-prepared samples was investigated using XRD as shown in Fig. 6 a. Before calcination, the as-obtained Cu-BTC has crystalline phase with characteristic peaks at 2 theta of 10.3, 11.5, 13.6° and etc., in agreement with the typical HKUST-1 crystalline phase reported elsewhere [31,32]. The Cu-BTC#SiO2-s-n show a group of resemble reflection peaks with weakened intensity upon the silica content. Alongside, the peak becomes broadened, indicating the decreased crystallite size of HKUST-1 caused by the hybridized silica. Generally, the smaller the Cu3(BTC)2 crystallite size is, the more homogeneous hybridization is obtained. It illustrates well that the hybridization degree can be tuned by the silica content. After calcination at 400 °C, all of the samples present a group of reflection peaks at 35.4, 38.4, 48.8° and etc., indexed to the CuO crystalline (JCPDS card no. 48-1548) [33], seeing Fig. 6b. Correspondingly, the crystallite size of CuO particles decreased with the increase of silica content (seeing Table 1). It demonstrates that the CuO crystallite size is associated with the hybridization degree, and effectively regulated by the silica content. Noteworthily, having the same silica content, the CuO/SiO2-sol exhibits comparable metal dispersion as that of CuO#SiO2-s1, significant higher than the CuO/SiO2-im (Fig. S1 in Supporting information). This suggests the prominent merit of our in situ hybridization method in metal dispersion improvement. The metal dispersion can be seen clearly by the high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) observation in Fig. 7 . For the calcinated Cu-BTC, it exhibits poly-dispersed metal nanoparticles in the range from 10 to 200 nm supported on the irregular bulk (Fig. 7a-c). The hybridized silica can significantly improve the metal dispersion. The CuO#SiO2-s0.5 (Fig. 7d-f) presents aggregated silica particles (∼50 nm) with highly dispersed copper particles distributed on (depicted by red circles). Some free copper particles ranging in 5−15 nm is observed clearly, which exhibit fringe values of 0.232 and 0.252 nm, indexed to the (-111) and (111) crystalline plane of CuO, respectively. As for the CuO#SiO2-s2 (Fig. 7g–i), it hold relatively large size of silica particles (∼100 nm) with randomly distributed copper nanoparticles (marked by red circles), which are hybridized with the silica and merely envisioned by the lattice fringe. Distinctively, seldom free copper particle can be seen. This result suggests the intensified metal-support interaction caused by the homogeneously hybridized silica. To reveal the porosity of CuO#SiO2-s-n based materials, nitrogen adsorption measurements were conducted. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of different samples with the corresponding pore size distributions were plotted in Fig. 8 , and the surface area, pore volume and pore sizes were listed in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 8, all of the calcined CuO#SiO2-s-n show typical IV type adsorption desorption isotherms, indicating their characteristic mesoporisity. The sample CuO#SiO2-s0.25 with low silica content presents a type-H2b hysteresis loops in the p/p0 range of 0.5-0.9, indicating a broadened porosity attributed by the space between the 3D connected nanoparticles. The samples CuO#SiO2-s0.5 and CuO#SiO2-s1 with medium/high silica contents exhibit a type-H4 hysteresis loops in the p/p0 range from 0.4 to1.0, suggesting a narrow pore size distribution which is dependent on the silica content [28]. The above results reveal that silica content influences the formation of mesopores in the calcinated materials. The pore size distribution is associated with the crystallite size of Cu-BTC confined in the silica skeleton, which are systematically tunable by controlling the silica content. Noting that, the CuO/SiO2-so1 prepared without the addition of BTC, shows a shrink surface area with a broadened pore size distribution (seeing Fig. S2 of Supporting information). This illustrates the significant role of BTC utilization in our in situ hybridized synthesized route, which can remarkably increase the meso-pore volume, helping the active copper escape from silica coating, or serving as accesses for reactant to the active centers [34]. The XPS technique gives insights into the electronic state and composition of copper species on the surface of the catalysts (Fig. 9 ). For the Cu 2p3/2 photoelectron spectra, the binding energy peaks centered at ∼934.0 and 930 eV, are assigned to the oxidized copper and metallic copper species, respectively, and the typical binding energy peaks at 940−945 eV are attributed to the shake-up satellite peak as well [35]. All of the fresh CuO#SiO2-s-n catalysts show similar spectra of a typical CuO phase, indicating the transformation of CuO from the Cu ion nodes by calcination. Noteworthily, the Cu 2p binding energy shifts towards high energy with increasing silica content, suggesting intensified metal-support interaction [36,37]. The binding energy values of the O 1s and Si 2p3/2 core levels for the CuO#SiO2-s-n catalysts are compiled in Table 2 . The two signals obtained for O 1s, at approximately 530.0 and 532.0 eV, correspond to the lattice oxygen and hydroxyl or carbonate species, respectively, and the peak at approximately 103.5 eV is associated with Si-O species. Compared with the value measured by ICP-OES, the XPS derived molar ratios of Cu/Si are relatively low, seeing Table 2, and such discrepancy becomes prominent for the sample with high silica content. This could be associated with the weakened XPS signal caused by the trapping of photoelectron by the silica layer. The Raman signal is associated intimately with the crystallite, coordination state and electronic properties of surface atoms, reflecting the interaction information between various compounds. The intensified interactions between the CuO and silica can be verified further by the Raman spectra (Fig. 10 a). Three prominent peaks assigned to the CuO Ag and Bg bands are observable for these CuO#SiO2-s-n samples [38]. Increasing the silica content, the peak at ∼279 cm−1 shifts towards low wave number and, accompanying with the peak broaden (Fig. 10b). It can indicate the intensified metal-support interactions well as reported by other scientists’ group [39]. The reducibility of copper oxide was estimated from H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) curves (Fig. 11 a). This reduction process strongly depends on the silica content and its interaction with the metal precursor. A broadened peak centered at 210−240 °C is observed for all of the catalysts, corresponding to the reduction of copper oxide, which shifts towards higher temperature as the silica content increases. These results indicate that the CuO species become hard reducible upon increase of silica content. For the CuO#SiO2-s2, there appear multiple reduction peaks, including 211, 323 and 371 °C, suggesting that there exists mixed species with varied reducibility. Usually, it has been reported that dispersed CuO with small particle size is easier reducible than bulk particles, and cause a shift of the maximum reduction temperature from 300 to 240° [9–10,35–37]. However, it’s not the case for the CuO#SiO2-s-n catalysts. The HRTEM images of CuO#SiO2-s-n presents small CuO nanoparticles supported on silica, instead of large free particles. Thus, considering the above XPS and Raman analysis, we intend to attribute the shift towards high temperature mainly to the intensified metal-support interactions as result of the homogeneously hybridization [13]. In addition, the excessive silica may overcoat the CuO phase, especially for CuO#SiO2-s2, which make it more hard reducible as well [25]. As expected, the hydrogen consumption, calculated by integration of the TPR peaks, is plotted as function with the metal loading (Fig. 11b), showing a good linear regression with the stoichiometry line (blue dotted line). This suggests that the H2 consumption is proportional to the copper loading, indicative of high reduction degree (>90 %)."
8,Hydrogenation of furfural over the various catalyst,"3.3 Hydrogenation of furfural over the various catalyst Various catalysts were evaluated for furfural (FF) hydrogenation under the given reaction conditions (140 °C, 2.0 MPa). In the current study, the only products detected were furfural alcohol (FAOL) and 2-methylfuran (MF), which is consistent with previous results with copper-based catalysts [8,40]. It has been revealed that the molecularly adsorbed FF interacts with the Cu surface via the lone pair of oxygen to produce η1(O)-aldehyde species, which facilitates the formation of FAOL and MF, seeing Fig. 12 [41]. Herein, all of the hybridized catalysts exhibited high selectivity of FAOL (>98 %) regardless of their FF conversions, demonstrating their preferential selectivity toward FAOL. It agrees well with several reports by other groups [8,42]. As shown in Fig. 13 , the FF conversion varies depending upon the silica content. The pristine Cu-BTC shows negligible FF conversion, while the CuO#SiO2-s0.25 and CuO#SiO2-s0.5 present high FF conversion of 100 % and 95 %, respectively. Further increases the silica content, the conversion declines. Considering the mass activity is an important indicator for practical application, the average FF conversion rate per mole of Cu per hour (r) was calculated. It shows a volcano type plot, and a highest r value of 9.2 molFFmolCu −1 h−1 was achieved for CuO#SiO2-s1. To the best of our knowledge, the catalytic performance in this work is among the top-listed copper based catalysts compared with the other representative catalysts from the literatures, seeing Table S2 in Supporting Information and [43–45]. Apparently, the excellent catalytic activity of CuO#SiO2-s1 benefits from the high metal dispersion. This can be attributed to the intensified metal-support interactions (justified by the Raman spectra and XPS analysis) as result of the in situ homogeneous hybridization manner. Additionally, the abundant mesopores in CuO#SiO2-s1 contributes to its enhanced hydrogenation activity as well by elevating the active site accessibility. Furthermore, the CuO#SiO2-s1 exhibits excellent activity overwhelming the two reference catalysts CuO/SiO2-im and CuO/SiO2-sol, seeing Table S1 of Supporting information, demonstrating the superiority of the current in situ hybridization method in the catalyst design. At high silica content, Cu-BTC#SiO2-s2, even with high metal dispersion, displays both declined conversion and mass reaction rate. These results demonstrate that there is an optimal silica content exists for our Cu-BTC#SiO2-s-n catalysts. In several documents [35–40], the copper based catalysts were reduced by H2 before reaction, due to that the metallic copper is the active sites. Thus, a series of CuO#SiO2-s-n were reduced by hydrogen at 300 °C to evaluate their hydrogenation performance (seeing Table S3 in Supporting Information). Unfortunately, all of them displayed a low activity compared with the calcinated ones. It illustrates that the CuO#SiO2-s-n catalysts are more suitable to be activated by air calcination rather than H2 reduction. The used catalyst was characterized by XRD and XPS. We found that the CuO phase has been transformed into metallic copper or Cu2O (Fig. 14 a), and the corresponding XPS spectra (Fig. 14b) confirms the co-existence of CuO, Cu2O and metallic Cu with various molar ratio of (Cu°+Cu+)/Cu2+ following the trend of CuO#SiO2-s0.25> CuO#SiO2-s1> CuO#SiO2-s2>Cu-BTC. This result verifies that the metallic Cu/Cu2O is the active phase [35,46], while also addressed the correlation between the activity and the reducibility of copper species. Moreover, the Cu LMM AES spectra (Fig. 14c) displays a broad and asymmetric peaks, which can be deconvoluted into two symmetrical peaks indexed to the Cu° and Cu+, respectively [25]. The various atomic ratio of Cu°/Cu+ varies dependent on the silica content, further verifying the regulation of reducibility by the introduced silica. Generally, the reducibility of CuO is associated with the particle size, and high metal dispersion leads to the low reduction temperature [8,35]. Controversially, our TPR and XPS results verify that the highly dispersed CuO became hardly reducible, similar trend has been reported in researches involved with single atomic catalysts as well [47,48], which they ascribed to the strong metal-support interactions. Considering the catalysts preparation manner and the above results (XRD, TEM, XPS, TPR, Raman and etc.), we ascribe the modified reducibility to the intensified metal-support interaction as result of homogeneously hybridization of silica and copper. Additionally, excessive content silica species may overcoat in the interface of copper phase, making reduction more difficult and activity center inaccessible [25,34]. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that a balance between the metal dispersion and reducibility exists for this novel CuO#SiO2 catalyst: i) at low silica content (molar ratio Cu/Si≥0.23), the improved metal dispersion caused by the strong metal supporting interaction, as result of the silica hybridization, dominates the enhanced reaction activity; ii) at high silica content (molar ratio Cu/Si<0.23), the intensified metal-supporting interaction, as well as the silica coating, produces the hard reducible CuO species, resulting in decline mass reaction rate. We conducted the catalytic performance evaluation for the CuO#SiO2-s0.25 catalysts and CuO#SiO2-s1 calcined at various temperatures, respectively. As shown in Fig. 15 a, CuO#SiO2-s0.25 is susceptible to the calcination temperatures, the best performance is occurred at 300 °C, and it declines as the temperature elevates. Intriguingly, CuO#SiO2-s1 shows a relatively stable conversion rate independent on the calcinated temperatures. The XRD patterns and HRTEM images verifies the robust resist-sintering properties of CuO#SiO2-s1 upon calcination, seeing Fig. S3 and Fig. S4 in Supporting information. Moreover, the ICP-OES data discloses limited metal leaching occurs for these used catalysts. However, the CuO#SiO2-s0.25 presents poor resist-sintering capacity. Thus, we preliminarily attribute the stable catalytic performance of CuO#SiO2-s1 to its robust resist-sintering/leaching capacity. This can be assignable to the strong interaction between the CuO and SiO2, which may be originated from the highly hybridized form or mesoporous silica coating. More of experiments and evidences is required to reveal such interactions mechanism, which is under the way in our further work. The recycle test was conducted for the two catalysts as shown in Fig. 15b. An activity decline of 5 and 17 % after 5 times repeated run are observed for the CuO#SiO2-s1 and CuO#SiO2-s0.25, respectively. These results verify that CuO#SiO2-s1 possessed high stability overwhelming CuO#SiO2-s0.25, demonstrating that the proper introduced silica addition not only improve catalytic activity but also improve catalyst stability. Finally, the effect of reaction temperature and hydrogen pressure on the catalytic performance of the CuO#SiO2-s1 were investigated comprehensively. As shown in Fig. 16 , an exponential increase of activity is observed in the temperature range of 100−160 °C, along with a relatively low apparent activation energy of 67.1 kJ/mol compared with others reported elsewhere. With respect to the hydrogen pressure, the conversion elevates with the increased pressure from 1.4 to 2.5 MPa, then decreases unexpectedly at pressure higher than 2.5 MPa. Generally, high pressure can promote the solubility of hydrogen, and accelerate the hydrogenation rate; further increasing the pressure may facilitate the oligomerization of FF, and cause activity decline [46]."
9,Conclusions,"By fine control of the hydrolysis of TEOS and coordination of Cu ions with BTC, a homogeneously hybridized Cu-BTC#SiO2 composite was obtained successfully, and further calcination in situ yielded a mesoporous silica supported highly dispersed copper nanoparticles catalyst, CuO#SiO2. The optimized CuO#SiO2-s1 catalyst, showed excellent catalytic activity and stability towards the FF hydrogenation, a high mass activity as 9.2 molFF molCu −1 h−1 with nearly 100 % selectivity and minimized activity decline (<5%) after 5 repeated run was achieved. The improved activity can be beneficial to its highly metal dispersion, comparable reducible Cu species and abundant mesoporous reaction assesses. This work will open up new avenues for the synthesis of mesoporous silica supported highly dispersed metal catalyst for hydrogenation."
