0,Introduction,"Due to its excellent film-forming properties, outstanding chemical stability, and numerous other advantageous characteristics, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) use is expected to significantly increase worldwide. However, PVA’s forthcoming popularity will also correspond to an increase in environmental degradation (Imran et al., 2015; Halima, 2016). PVA is a typical recalcitrant pollutant with a high molecular weight. It is also a well-known surfactant, which enables the movement of heavy metals throughout the sediments of streams, lakes, and oceans, potentially resulting in a wide range of ecological problems (Sun et al., 2017). In recent years, a variety of different PVA contamination treatment methods have been proposed. Examples include, but are not limited to, salting-out (Zimmermann and Schindler, 1979), biodegradation (Wang et al., 2019), membrane separation (Wang et al., 2019), and use of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) (Miklos et al., 2018). Among these options, AOPs have proven to be the most effective for pre-treating PVA wastewater and improving its biodegradability (Sun et al., 2017), concluding the wet oxidation process (Chen et al., 2000), the Fenton process (Kang et al., 2002), a persulfate-Fe system (Oh et al., 2009), and ionizing radiation (Sun et al., 2015). However, PVA wastewater always contains up to 10,000 mg/L dissolved organic carbon, which results in a high chemical oxygen demand (COD) (Lei et al., 1998). For example, in the textile industry, the PVA-containing desizing wastewater COD concentration is > 20,000 mg/L and the BOD5:COD ratio is often < 0.01 (Yu et al., 1996; Cornelius et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2017). Due to the high molecular weight and the PVA polymer’s recalcitrant property, large amounts of reagent are required to effectively treat the wastewater (Table 1 ). Thus, effective methods for treating high concentration PVA-contaminated wastewater using less reagent and power consumption are of significant interest to the scientific community. Traditional coagulation/flocculation has been used for many years as primary pre-treatment and treatment for industrial wastewater, as it is cost-effective and easily applied (Gunes et al., 2019; Chen et al., 1997). However, the PVA polymer contains abundant OH groups. Thus, traditional flocculation/coagulation technologies are not suitable choices, as PVA’s molecular composition is electrically neutral and highly hydrophilic (Bolto et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2015a; Ahmad et al., 2012). On the other hand, although the Fenton method alone cannot effectively mineralize high concentrations of PVA, it is particularly promising with respect to pretreatment (Guo et al., 2016; Ajmi et al., 2018). Thus, we hypothesized that if the Fenton reaction can improve PVA’s coagulation properties, then Fenton pre-oxidation coupled with coagulation can efficiently remove high concentrations of PVA. As such, we designed a two stage process accordingly. During the first stage, the Fenton process was applied to pre-oxidized PVA polymers. As reported, during the Fenton pre-treatment process, the long PVA molecule chains were broken up and the abundant PVA OH groups were partially oxidized to COOH or CO groups (Guo et al., 2016; Ajmi et al., 2018; Lin and Lo, 1997). In the second stage, Ca2+ was able to effectively interact with polyacid ions and form insoluble substances, such as oxalate, phytate, and citrate (Zerrouk et al., 1990; Wang et al., 2015b), which may be beneficial for coagulation of PVA oxidative products containing COOH or CO groups. Therefore, following pre-oxidation, CaCl2 might be a suitable coagulant for removal of both COD residues and soluble Fe3+. Above all, this study employed various advanced techniques to systematically study the feasibility of a two-stage treatment process for effective PVA removal. The impact of several key operational parameters for PVA removal are examined and optimized and a possible treatment mechanism is proposed. Additionally, due to the high concentration of Fe and Ca content, the sludge served as a low-cost adsorbent for antimony (Sb), which is considered an emerging, highly toxic contaminant (Liu et al., 2019). Thus, we also reused the sludge, thereby reducing its negative environmental impact. In summary, this study provides new insight into affordable and effective treatment of PVA-contaminated wastewater that can potentially be implemented on an industrial level."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Herein, we used analytical grade poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), 88 % hydrolyzed from polyvinyl acetate, with a molecular weight (Mw) ranging from 43,000–46,000 g/mol. The PVA, sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 98 %), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), ferrous sulfate (FeSO4·7H2O), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30 % v/v), calcium chloride (CaCl2, 96 %), sodium alginate (SA), potassium antimony tartrate hemihydrate iodine, boric acid (H3BO3), potassium iodide (KI), sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride (KCl), magnesium sulphate (MgSO4), and potassium antimony tartrate hemihydrate (C8H18K2O15Sb2) were all purchased from National Medicines, China. The catalase (40,000 ∼ 60,000 U) was purchased from J&K Scientific Ltd. All the reagents were of AR grade, and used without further purification. Doubly distilled water was used throughout the study."
3,Characterizations,"2.2 Characterizations The Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of PVA and PVA-Fe samples were analyzed using a 550Series II infrared spectrometer (Nicolet iS5, BRUKER Company, Switzerland) in the range of 4000–400 cm−1. Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, USA) was used to evaluate the PVA surface compositions. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) experiments were carried out using an HP Series Ⅱ Liquid Chromatograph with a PL-GPC50 SW column (GPC, US). The column temperature was 30 ℃ and the flow rate was 1 mL/min. An aqueous solution of 0.1 mol/L of Na2SO4 and 0.1 mol/L of Na2HPO4 was used as eluent. The samples’ X-ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns were determined with a Rigaku Corporation RINT-Ultima III X-ray Powder Diffractometer (XRD, Japan). A dynamic static laser light scattering instrument (BI-200SM, US) was used to measure the size and distribution of the PVA-Fe samples in a colloid system. JEOL 2100 Transmission electron microscopes (TEM, Japan) were employed to study the morphology microstructure characterizations of PVA-Fe precipitate. Zeta potential analysis was performed on a Malvern ZEN3600 zeta potential analyzer. Sb concentration was quantified with a Thermo Scientific iCAP-Q inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS, Waltham, MA). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method was used to measure the surface areas of the sludge using Quantachrome BET surface analyzer (Quantachrome Instruments, Boyton Beach, FL)."
4,Pre-oxidation and coagulation process for PVA removal,"2.3 Pre-oxidation and coagulation process for PVA removal The synthetic PVA-containing wastewater was prepared by dissolving 10 g/L PVA, 1 g/L sodium alginate, 1 mol/L NaOH, and 2 g/L sodium chloride into distilled water during continuous stirring at 90 ℃ for two hours. The Fenton pre-oxidation process was carried out in a test jar. A certain amount of FeSO4 was used as the catalyst, H2O2 was used as the oxidant, and the pH was adjusted by 1 mol/L of H2SO4 and 1 mol/L of NaOH. At different time intervals, aliquots of 1.0 mL were withdrawn and immediately filtered through a 0.22 μm syringe. Catalase was used to quench the reaction, due to its complete H2O2 consumption, and was added to the PVA solution in a quantity of 10 mg/L. We determined that the COD value of catalase (10 mg/L) in pure water was ∼ 82.30 mg/L. When catalase interacts with hydrogen peroxide, its structure is destroyed and the COD value is further reduced. Meanwhile, because the PVA-containing wastewater’s COD was almost 20,000 mg/L, we surmised that the COD produced by catalase has little effect on the determination of COD after the reaction. During the Ca-induced coagulation stage, a select amount of CaCl2 was added to the wastewater after pre-oxidation, and the solution pH was adjusted to basic. Then, the mixture was mixed at 250 rpm for two minutes, which was followed by slow agitation for 10 min at 40 rpm. After settling for 30 min, supernatant samples were obtained from a point 2 cm below the solution’s surface and sent for additional analysis."
5,The adsorption of Sb(III) on sludge residues,"2.4 The adsorption of Sb(III) on sludge residues The sludge residues were separated by filtration and dried at 80 ℃. The dried sludge powders were stored at room temperature, while awaiting further use. The Sb(III) adsorption was performed in a 100 mL flask, which was sealed and agitated at 100 rpm at room temperature. The typical reaction mixture was initiated with 1, 3, 10, 20 or 50 mg/L of Sb(III) solution and 0.2 g of sludge beads without pH adjustment. In some cases, the sludge adsorbent dosages were changed from 1 g/L to 6 g/L, and the initial pH value of the Sb(III) solution was adjusted from 2.0–12.0 with the addition of 0.1 mol/L HCl and 0.1 mol/L NaOH, as necessary. At specific time intervals, aliquots of 1.0 mL were withdrawn, and immediately filtered through a 0.22 μm syringe."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods The PVA concentration was determined using a Shimadzu UV-2401 UV–vis spectrophotometer (Japan). A 0.1 mL PVA solution sample was diluted to 10 mL, after which 5 mL of 4 % boric acid and 2 mL of I2-KI (1.27 g of I2 and 25.00 g of KI in 1 L) were added. The solution was equilibrated for five minutes, diluted to a volume of 25 mL, and analyzed at a wavelength of 690 nm. The COD measurement was obtained according to the closed reflux method (SM 5220 C) (APHA, 1998). All measurements were determined in triplicate."
7,Results and discussion,
8,The two-stage treatment of PVA-containing wastewater,"3.1 The two-stage treatment of PVA-containing wastewater Fenton pre-oxidation was used in the first stage of this two-stage experiment for the purpose of modifying the polymer properties and improving their applicability for coagulation. Fig. 1 a shows the changes in PVA concentration during the Fenton pre-oxidation process. Results suggest that the PVA concentration decreased rapidly within the first 15 min, contributing to 90 % of the ultimate removal. Furthermore, PVA destruction efficiency increased as a function of increasing FeSO4 dosage; with 8.0 g/L FeSO4 identified as optimal. Meanwhile, due to its high Mw, the simulative PVA wastewater COD value remained high and was only reduced by 23.3–49.6 % (Fig. 1b). During the second stage, CaCl2 was used as the coagulant to remove the desizing reagent’s residues. As shown in Fig. 1c, during pre-oxidation, 3.1 %, 24.5 %, 27.3 %, 38.6 %, and 49.1 % of simulated desizing wastewater COD was removed is response to different FeSO4 dosages. Next, 15.1 %, 43.3 %, 54.2 %, 81.3 %, and 61.5 % of corresponding COD was removed after Ca-induced coagulation. These results indicate that the coagulation efficiency correlates with the degree of PVA pre-oxidation, suggesting that formation of intermediates might be a crucial factor. During the pre-oxidation stage, enhanced PVA degradation positively contributed to the subsequent coagulation treatment, but excessive mineralization led to negative effects. These results indicate that the optimal FeSO4 dosage in the pre-oxidation stage is 8.0 g/L, and the optimal CaCl2 dosage in the coagulation stage is 40.0 g/L. The reagent dosage of this two-stage treatment appears to be large, mainly due to the ultra-high PVA concentration in the wastewater. Nevertheless, the optimal dosages of FeSO4 and CaCl2 per gram of PVA were 0.8 g/g-PVA and 4.0 g/g-PVA, respectively. Both the reagent dosage and the energy consumption during this two-stage treatment were significantly lower than that of other reported treatments (Table 1)."
9,The important factors,"3.2 The important factors In addition to Fe2+ dosage, H2O2 concentration is another important consideration in PVA pre-oxidation. Fig. 2 a shows the removal of PVA and COD as a function of the H2O2 dosage. When the H2O2 concentration was > 5 mg/L, the PVA removal rate was > 95 %, as the PVA molecules were partially destroyed by the Fenton pre-oxidation. Yet, when the H2O2 dosage increased from 5 mg/L to 40 mg/L, the COD removal during the Fenton pre-oxidation process reached 38.3 %, and was able to be further increased to 81.3 % after Ca-induced coagulation. However, an overdose of H2O2 (e.g. > 40 mg/L) negatively impacted the PVA oxidation, because the PVA molecules underwent an excessive amount of oxidation, which was not conducive to further coagulation. This phenomenon has been documented in previous studies (Mansouri et al., 2015). Essentially, PVA molecules can be partially oxidized easily, but are resistant to mineralization during Fenton pre-oxidation; thus the correct level of oxidation is required for further coagulation. Desizing wastewater usually maintains a temperature of 70–80 °C. We investigated the role of solution temperature in the removal of PVA and COD (Fig. 2b) and determined that the optimal temperature was 30 °C. Below that temperature, there is a sharp increase in COD concentration due to slow H2O2/Fe2+ reaction rates and once this temperature is exceeded, the increase in the COD concentration is limited. This experimental result is consistent with the phenomenon reported by Lin which used Fenton technology to treat PVA-containing desizing wastewater (Lin and Lo, 1997). Differently, many other existing reports suggested that the efficiency of the Fenton reaction increased with increasing temperature because of the enhanced generation rate of •OH radical. Therefore, we speculate that this phenomenon is related to PVA as a polymer. It is known that free radicals can abstract hydrogen atoms from polymer backbone and the polymerization initiated from the polymer radicals results in the production of crosslinked polymers. With the increase of the hydroxyl radical strength, the probability of free radical cross-linking of PVA also increases, leading to the slowdown of COD degradation efficiency. Therefore, the PVA-containing wastewater can be cooled down to 30 °C before pre-oxidation, thus achieving optimal PVA and COD removal efficiencies of 96.1 % and 81.3 %, respectively. Generally, the optimal solution pH value for a Fenton reaction is ∼ 3. To verify the effect of initial pH on pre-oxidation, we investigated the removal efficiency of PVA and COD under different pH conditions. As shown in Fig. 2c, when the simulation wastewater’s initial pH was 3.5, both the COD and PVA pre-oxidation removal efficiencies were optimized, which is consistent with conventional phenomenon. In addition to PVA, desizing wastewater also contains other sizing agents, such as starch, sodium alginate, gelatins, modified cellulose, and polyacrylate. To investigate their impact, sodium alginate was selected as a representative sizing agent and incorporated into the simulated PVA wastewater. As shown in Fig. 2d, during both stages, COD removal was clearly enhanced as the proportion of sodium alginate increased; largely due to the reduced stability of sodium alginate during the Fenton reaction. Furthermore, alginic acid could be linked with Ca2+ to form a crosslinked product, in which one Ca2+ ion was connected with two sodium alginate units, thereby further enhancing the coagulation effect (Wang et al., 2007)."
10,The important factors in Ca-induced coagulation process,"3.3 The important factors in Ca-induced coagulation process During the Fenton process, Fe2+ generated during the redox reactions will form ferric hydroxo complexes under alkaline conditions, which accounts for the Fenton reagent’s coagulation capability. When the pH is > 6, large amounts of small flocs are consistently observed following Fenton pre-oxidation. However, those flocs can take a very long time to settle, sometimes on the order of 12 h. Therefore, following pre-oxidation, coagulation was used to further remove additional COD residues. MgSO4, AlCl3, CaCl2, polyacrylamide (PAM+), and poly aluminum chloride (PAC) are the most commonly used coagulants/flocculants in wastewater treatment, and were employed herein to remove the COD residues. Our results showed that CaCl2 exhibited the best removal performance (Fig. S1). On one hand, CaCl2 is a strong electrolyte which promotes destabilization of colloidal particles. On the other hand, Ca2+ can efficiently bind with polyacid ions and form insoluble compounds, such as oxalate, phytate, and citrate (Zerrouk et al., 1990; Mishra and Bajpai, 2005), which are beneficial for coagulation of PVA oxidative products. Fig. 3 a shows the effect of CaCl2 dosage on coagulation. Note that there was an obvious increase in COD removal with increasing CaCl2 dosage, which peaked at 81.3 %, from a CaCl2 dosage of 40 g/L. However, an overdose of coagulant can cause the aggregated particles to re-disperse, which disrupts the particle settling process. This behavior could also be explained by the increase in repulsive energy between the coagulant and the pollutants in solution, which hinders floc formation (Mishra and Bajpai, 2005). Besides the Fenton reaction, the solution’s pH is another important factor in determining the effectiveness of Ca-induced coagulation. Fig. 3 b presents the results obtained for the coagulation performed under different initial pH values (3.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0, and 12.0). When the solution’s pH was > 8, it was capable of efficiently removing the PVA-containing wastewater’s organic load, thus achieving 81.3 % COD removal and 95.6 % PVA removal. These results are partially due to the effects of metal hydrolysis, which include adsorption, charge neutralization, interparticle bridging, and enmeshment. For example, iron hydrolysis involves generation of Fe3+, FeOH2 +, Fe(OH)2 +, and Fe(OH)3 from a solution with a pH range that normally falls between 7 and 9 (Rui et al., 2010). Furthermore, a higher pH is required for generation of sufficient anions (R-O–) to efficiently bond with Ca2+."
11,The proposed mechanism,"3.4 The proposed mechanism PVA polymers contain abundant −OH groups. Since their molecular composition is electrically neutral and highly hydrophilic, traditional flocculation/coagulation techniques are not effective options. After pre-oxidation, the PVA polymers are partially oxidized, thereby improving their coagulation capability. In order to further explore the properties of potential PVA pre-oxidation products, these substances were characterized using advanced instrumental analysis techniques, including FTIR, XPS, GPC, and zeta potential. The PVA FTIR spectra at different reaction times, under optimal conditions, are shown in Fig. 4 a. The FTIR spectra of pretreated PVA showed a significant change in band character when compared with initial PVA. The OH hydroxyl group at 3450 cm−1 depicted a broad absorption peak which increased significantly after pre-oxidation. The vibrational band observed at 2926 cm−1 represents stretching of the CH bond in the alkyl groups. During the Fenton pre-oxidation, this vibrational band decreased as the reaction times increased until it disappeared completely, suggesting that the PVA polymeric chains were undergoing a bond-breaking process. Furthermore, the strong peak centered at 1728 cm−1 is attributed to stretching of the CO and CO bonds in the acetate group comprising the PVA copolymer and the polyvinyl acetate (PVAC). The increased intensity observed in the 1728 cm−1 peak is important, as it indicates that oxidation of PVA led to formation of CO groups. Moreover, the simultaneous formation of υ(OH), υ(CO) and υ(CO) bands, and their respective vibrational frequency ranges, points to the production of associated carboxylic acid groups (−COOH). The intensity reduction in the CH stretching mode also suggests a direct −COOH formation mechanism involving surface CH bonds. The result of our XPS analysis also confirmed the formation of −COOH groups in the PVA pre-oxidation products. As shown in Fig. 4b, following pre-oxidation, the PVA binding-energy peaks were assigned to CC (284.8 eV), COH (286.2 eV), CO C1s (287.5 eV), and COOH C1s (289.0 eV). When compared with the initial PVA results, an apparent increase in peak intensity at 287.5 and 289.0 eV was observed in the Fenton pre-oxidized PVA. The increase in COOH groups may play an important role in the subsequent Ca-induced coagulation. Moreover, the molecular weight measurement of degraded PVA is presented in Fig. 4 c and Table 2 . The PVA’s initial Mw (weight-average) was 37,254, and rapidly dropped to 1384, demonstrating a significant decrease in the PVA Mw due to the Fenton reaction. The inset shows the PVA zeta potential before and after pre-oxidation, which decreased sharply from −0.2 mV to −7.9 mV. This result supports our premise that the PVA’s increasing coagulation efficiency following pre-oxidation could be due to the increased electrostatic interaction between pre-oxidation products and coagulants. Therefore, we propose that a suitable degree of Fenton pre-oxidation will facilitate breakage of the long PVA chains and introduce the −COOH groups into their chemical structure, resulting in enhanced coagulation properties. The flocs generated by the two-stage treatment were assessed via XRD and laser light scattering. In the XRD spectra, broad peaks, around 15° and 30° confirmed that the flocs contained a substantial amount of amorphous material (Fig. 5 a). These may be derived from the organic degradation products produced by PVA, as the diffraction angles were not consistent with those of the initial PVA. Meanwhile, the diffraction peaks of the flocs that were generated with pre-oxidation corresponded with those of CaC2O4·2H2O (ICDD file, No 87-0655, Weddellite, labelled as “◆”) and NaCl (labelled as “●”). NaCl was the main component in the simulant desizing wastewater. Meanwhile, the presence of a crystal structure similar to oxalic acid, CaC2O4·2H2O, indicates that HOOC−COOH might be the predominant structure among the PVA pre-oxidation products; a compound that is able to bind with Ca2+ and form insoluble compounds. Furthermore, the Fe species content could also be identified from the XRD spectrum (ICDD file, No 75-1594, FeO(OH), labelled as “♣”). As shown in Fig. 5b, when CaCl2 was added to PVA-contaminated wastewater that had not undergone pre-oxidation, the flocs’ main components were CaCl2·4H2O (ICDD, No 72-1015), CaCO3, and NaCl (ICDD, No 83-0577)— completely different from the characteristic CaC2O4·2H2O patterns. The flocs’ morphology and size were determined by laser light scattering (Fig. 6 ). Note that flocs generated with pre-oxidation depicted a diameter of ∼ 4057 ± 104 nm; each floc particle consisted of nanorods typically 50 ± 6 nm wide and up to 150 ± 14 nm long. Fig. 6 d shows that the flocs’ interplanar spacings were ∼ 1.99 Å and 2.76 Å, which corresponds to the (2 2 0) plane of NaCl and the (1 4 1) plane of CaC2O4•2H2O, respectively. Fig. 7 illustrates the primary potential mechanism proposed for the two-stage treatment of PVA-containing wastewater. The Fenton reaction was used as the pre-oxidation process in order to improve PVA’s coagulation properties. The long PVA molecule chains were broken up by means of calibrated oxidation and the −OH groups were partially oxidized to −COOH. During coagulation, CaCl2 was used to remove both the COD residues and the soluble Fe3+. CaCl2 both promoted colloidal particle destabilization due to its strong electrolytic property, and was able to efficiently bind with the HOOCCOOH structure of the PVA’s pre-oxidation products, forming insoluble compounds that enabled the majority of the COD residues to be removed."
12,The reuse of sludge residue to remove antimony,"3.5 The reuse of sludge residue to remove antimony Large amounts of sludge were generated by the two-stage treatment of PVA-containing wastewater, which needed to be reclaimed in order to reduce its negative influence on the environment. Antimony (Sb) is considered an emerging contaminant with high toxicity in limited concentrations (Liu et al., 2019; Gutknecht et al., 2017; Bacelo et al., 2018). Thus, due to the high concentration of Fe and Ca in sludge, the sludge was proposed as a low-cost adsorbent for Sb removal. The sludge’s surface area (S BET) was determined by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller equation (BET) and the total pore volume (VT) was defined as the maximum amount of nitrogen adsorbed at a relative pressure of P/P0 = 0.99. The average pore diameter (Dp) was calculated using the 4VT/SBET ratio. Sludge N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms at 77 K are shown in Fig. S2, where the SBET is 20.63 m2/g. Moreover, the sludge’s total pore volume is 0.05 cm3/g and the average pore diameter is 2.97 nm. Batch test results depicted a removal efficiency of ∼80 %, demonstrating that the sludge residue can be effectively utilized to reduce Sb concentration from the solution. Fig. 8 depicts the adsorption kinetics for Sb removal at different initial concentrations in the presence of 2.0 g/L sludge at a pH of 8. Fig. 8 a shows that the sludge’s adsorption of Sb was a rapid process. The sludge’s adsorption capacity was essentially saturated following 15 min of reaction time, after which the adsorption remained at equilibrium. In addition, the total amount of adsorbed Sb grew as the initial Sb concentration increased. To determine the rate-control and mass transfer of Sb, kinetic data was correlated to linear forms of the pseudo-first-order and second-order rate models. As shown in Table S1, the present sorption system predominantly follows the second-order rate model and the overall process appears to be controlled by chemisorption. Additionally, we measured the adsorption capacity of the CS-Cu-Fe beads for potential use in Cr(VI) removal. As illustrated in Fig. 8c, the Langmuir isotherm showed the best fit with the experimental results (Table S2, coefficient of determination R2 = 0.9683), whereas the Freundlich isotherm depicted a low correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.8757), and thereby showed less agreement with the experimental data. This suggests that the adsorption sites on the sludge were homogeneous with monolayer adsorption coverage. According to the Langmuir equation’s fitted parameter, the sludge’s sorption capacity was 171.71 mg/g, indicating that it satisfied practical application potential. As demonstrated in Fig. 9 a, the Sb(III) removal increased as the adsorbent dosage increased from 0.5 g/L to 1.0 g/L, but remained almost unchanged when adsorbent dosage ranged from 2.0–6.0 g. This positive correlation is due to the availability of a larger surface area and more adsorption sites. At adsorbent dosage >1.0 g, the incremental Sb(III) removal becomes very low as the surface metal ions concentration and the solution metal ions concentration come into equilibrium with each other. The effect of pH on Sb removal was also investigated over a wide range of pH values (2.0–12.0). Fig. 9 b indicates that the maximum Sb(III) adsorption occurred at pH = 4.0, after which Sb(III) removal decreased as the pH increased. Sb(OH)3 are the predominant species from pH 3–9 for Sb(III), while SbO2 − species are existing in the Sb(III) solution when pH > 9. But on the other hand, under acidic conditions, the amount of free Fe3+ on the sludge’s surface increases, which improves the likelihood of Fe and Sb binding. Therefore, weak alkaline conditions are more suitable for the sludge adsorbents. The presence of common ions coexisting in dye laden wastewater may imply competition for available Sb(III) adsorption sites. Thus, it was necessary to investigate the competitive influence of commonly coexisting anions and cations on Sb(III) adsorption. Common cations and anions in dye wastewater, e.g., Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ and NO3 −, Cl−, HPO4 −, and SO4 −, respectively, were applied in the coexisting ions investigation. Fig. 9c and d show that the influences of Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, NO3 −, Cl−, and SO4 2- on Sb(III) adsorption can be ignored. However, the competitive adsorption of HPO4 − clearly suppressed Sb(III) adsorption on the sludge. This phosphate inhibition effect on Sb(III) adsorption has been previously reported by Liu et al. and is mainly due to the fact that Phosphorus (P) and Sb share similar physicochemical properties, as they are both from group 15 of the periodic table. Therefore, when the wastewater contains a high concentration of phosphate, the sludge adsorbent dosage must be increased accordingly. Additionally, the Sb-adsorbed sludge could be characterized as potentially toxic due to the concentrated Sb loading at the end of the adsorption process. In this regard, the Sb leaching from spent sludge adsorbent was investigated in a neutral water medium based on toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) (Hazardous Waste Management System, 1997). Due to the Sb concentration in the actual dyeing wastewater is about 0.5 ∼ 2.5 mg/L, the sludge adsorbent was used to treat the wastewater with an initial Sb(III) concentration of 3.0 mg/L and then evaluated by TCLP. The results showed that the Sb leaching concentration was 0.12 mg/L, which was far below the limit value in the standard of 40 CFR 268.40 (1.15 mg/L) (Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), 2019). Thus, we consider that the Sb on the sludge adsorbent is relatively stable and does not require further solid stabilization."
13,Conclusion,"In this study, we proposed a two-stage treatment process using Fenton pre-oxidation coupled with Ca-induced coagulation to remove the high concentration PVA from industrial wastewater. The optimized dosages of FeSO4 and CaCl2 were determined to be 0.8 g/g-PVA and 4.0 g/g-PVA, respectively, both of which are significantly lower than that of other reported treatments. Through calibrated oxidation, PVA’s long molecule chains were broken up and the −OH groups were partially oxidized to −COOH. During the coagulation stage, Ca2+ was able efficiently bind with the PVA pre-oxidation products, thereby forming insoluble compounds that enabled the majority of the COD residue to be removed. Furthermore, the sludge residues were reclaimed and used to remove Sb(III) from the wastewater, ultimately achieving a 16.0 mg/g Sb(III) adsorption capacity. These results demonstrate that our proposed two-stage treatment process is highly efficient, technically feasible, and cost-effective. We anticipate that this process will have a practical application in the future treatment of high concentration PVA-contaminated wastewater."
