0,Introduction,"Energy crisis and environmental pollution become more and more serious nowadays. Hydrogen is generally considered as a clean and renewable energy. The photocatalytic splitting of water using solar energy is an attractive way to produce clean and recyclable hydrogen fuel{Cheng, 2012 #30} [1]. This process is inspired by natural photosynthesis in green plants and the Z scheme system has received more and more attention [2–7]. Recently, Iwashina et al. constructed a Z-type catalytic system using RGO-TiO2 as an O2-evolving photocatalyst and metal sulfide as an H2-evolving photocatalyst, and this Z-type catalytic system possesses enhanced H2 generation activity at 400 μmol g−1 h−1 [7]. The organic pollutants degradation and simultaneous hydrogen production with photocatalysis began in the early ninety’s of last century [8]. In recent years, some scholars have achieved good results in photocatalytic decomposition of water for hydrogen production in the Z scheme system when organic compounds acted as the sacrificial agent [7,9–16]. Li et al. synthesized CdS-Au-WO3 Z-type system with lactic acid as sacrificial reagent, and the hydrogen production rate is 21,400 μmol g−1 h−1 [9]. Zheng et al. synthesized CdS-Au-HCNS Z-type system with triethanolamine solution as sacrificial reagent, and the hydrogen production rate is 2,700 μmol g−1 h−1 [16]. Furthermore, there were many reports about the degradation of organic pollutants in the Z scheme system [17–29]. Zhu et al. have constructed a TiO2-Au-CdS Z photocatalytic oxidation system with hollow nanorod arrays, and the degradation rate of methyl blue reached 72% after 2 h of photoreaction [17]. A g-C3N4/Bi2MoO6 Z photocatalytic oxidation system was reported by Lv et al., and the degradation rate of rhodamine B reached 90% after 40 min of photoreaction [25]. However, there is few report about hydrogen generation from water splitting and simultaneous degradation of organic pollutants in the Z scheme. The wastewater from biohydrogen production by dark fermentation contains a large number of small organic molecules, such as organic acids, alcohols and aldehydes [30–32]. If these organic pollutants in the wastewater can be used as sacrificial agents to promote photocatalytic decomposition of aquatic hydrogen, it not only can achieve the efficient conversion of pollutants and recovery of resource in water, but also can prevent the wastewater to pollute the environment effectively. In this work, we used the Z scheme photocatalyst 1.0La-ZnIn2S4/1.5RGO/1.0RuO2/BiVO4 (1:5) synthesized in our previous work [5] to evaluate the activities of hydrogen generation from water splitting and organic pollutants degradation under visible-light irradiation. The catalytic mechanism was also discussed."

3,Preparation of photocatalyst,"2.2 Preparation of photocatalyst The Z scheme photocatalyst used in this experiment is 1.0La2O3-ZnIn2S4/1.5RGO/1.0RuO2/BiVO4 (1:5), which was preferred in our previous work [23]. The catalyst was synthesized by the hydrothermal method on the basis of 1.5RGO/1.0RuO2/BiVO4。 The synthesis steps of 1.5RGO/1.0RuO2/BiVO4 have been introduced in our previous work [5]. Here, we only elaborate the final synthesis step of the Z scheme photocatalyst. 1 g 1.5RGO/1.0RuO2/BiVO4 was added into 50 mL distilled water, a desired amount of ZnSO4·7H2O, TAA, In(NO3)3·4H2O and La(NO3)3·6H2O were then added according to the mass ratio of 1.0La2O3-ZnIn2S4 (the content of La in 1.0La2O3-ZnIn2S4 is 1.0 wt %) and BiVO4, which is 1:5. The mixed solution was stirred for 30 min and then transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. The autoclave was sealed and kept at 160 °C for 1 h, and then cooled to room temperature naturally. A brown precipitate was obtained, then filtered and washed with absolute ethanol and deionized water for three times. After dried in a vacuum at 80 °C for 12 h, 1.0La2O3-ZnIn2S4/RGO/RuO2/BiVO4 (1:5) was obtained. The characterization of 1.0La2O3-ZnIn2S4/1.5RGO/1.0RuO2/BiVO4 also have been introduced in our previous work [5]. ZnIn2S4 covered the surface of BiVO4 and the extent of graphitization intensity ratio of the D to G bands of RGO (ID/IG) was 0.53. In order to study the mechanism, we also synthesize the catalyst of 1.0RGO/1.0La2O3-ZnIn2S4. The preparation method of this catalyst is same as our previous work [5,33], here no longer to repeat."
4,Photocatalytic reaction,"2.3 Photocatalytic reaction Photocatalytic reactions were conducted in a gastight stainless steel reactor same as our previous work [5,33,34] In all experiments, 200 mL of deionized water containing a desired amount of catalyst (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 or 2.5 g L−1) and organic compound (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 mol L−1) was added into the reaction cell. Here, the organic compound was acted as pollutant. In order to remove air prior to the reaction, argon gas was bubbled through the reaction mixture for 30 min before the reaction started. The temperature for all the photocatalytic reactions remained at 25 ± 1 °C. Pt as a cocatalyst for the promotion of hydrogen evolution was photodeposited in situ on the Z scheme photocatalyst from the precursor of H2PtCl6·6H2O [35] when there was special instruction. The concentrations of H2 were measured with a gas chromatograph (Shanghai Precision & Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd., GC-112A) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Samples were taken at intervals of 60 min at 500 μL. The chromatographic column is filled with high performance carbon molecular sieve. The carrier gas is argon with 99.99% purity. The temperature of injector, column and TCD detector are 100 °C, 100 °C and 120 °C respectively. The loading current is 70 mA. All the measurements of the produced H2 concentrations at different irradiation time were performed three times to confirm their reproducibility. The analysis of organic compounds were performed in a high performance liquid chromatograph (LC2000, Shanghai Techcomp Instrument Ltd, China) using a Symmetry C18 column and a mobile phase consisted of 70% methanol (chromatographic pure) and 30% water. Apparent quantum yields (A.Q.Y.) and energy conversion efficiency (η c) were measured same as our previous work [5,33,34], here no longer to repeat."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effects of the reaction condition on the activity of hydrogen generation,"3.1 Effects of the reaction condition on the activity of hydrogen generation 3.1.1 Effect of the type of organic pollutants Fig. 1 shows the effect of the different organic pollutants on the activities of hydrogen generation of Z scheme system. The initial concentration of organic pollutants were 1.0 mol L−1, the catalyst concentration of Z scheme photocatalyst was 1.0 g L−1. To compare with the different organic pollutants, the result of the activity of Z scheme photocatalyst in distilled water without organic pollutants was also shown in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1, when the organic pollutants are formaldehyde, methanol, formic acid, acetaldehyde, ethanol, acetic acid, ethylene glycol, propionaldehyde, triethylamine and butyraldehyde, the activity is 180, 146, 104, 78, 62, 56, 50, 46, 36 and 29 μmol g−1 in 6 h, respectively. Compared with the situation that added none organic pollutants (the activity is only 24 μmol g−1 in 6 h), the existence of these organic compounds play a certain promotion effect on the activity of hydrogen production of Z scheme system. This can be attributed to the fact that organic compound facilitates the separation of photoelectrons, and then promoting hydrogen production. The promotion order of these organic compounds is formaldehyde > methanol > formic acid > acetaldehyde > ethanol > acetic acid > glycol > propaldehyde > triethylamine > butyraldehyde. Apparently, the promotion order of the organic compounds is aldehydes > alcohols > organic acids when the length of their carbon chains is the same, and short carbon chain > long carbon chain when the type of them is the same. This rule is similar to that of nucleophilic reaction of oxygen-containing organic compounds. In the nucleophilic reaction of oxygen-containing organic compounds, aldehydes carbonyl carbon has stronger electrophilicity than carboxylic carbonyl carbon, and carboxylic carbonyl carbon has stronger electrophilicity than alcohols hydroxyl carbon. For the same type of aldehydes and acids, short-chain organic compounds have stronger electrophilicity than long-chain organic compounds [36]. In the nucleophilic reaction, OH− is a highly active nucleophilic reagent. Formaldehyde and other oxygen-containing organic compounds are easily catalyzed by OH− to form enol anions, which is conducive to trapping photogenerated holes, which makes organic molecules have a higher ability to capture the hole than O2 − [37]. Therefore, the different electrophilicity of carbon in oxygen-containing organic matter makes the promotion of hydrogen production in catalytic system different. For the promotion order of the organic compounds is aldehydes > alcohols > organic acids in our experiment, this maybe due to the fact that the organic acids have a certain corrosion effect to ZnIn2S4 [38,39]. 3.1.2 Effect of the catalyst concentration Fig. 2 shows the effect of the amount of the catalysts on the photocatalytic activities of Z scheme system when HCHO acted as organic pollutant. The concentration of organic pollutant formaldehyde was 1 mol L−1, the initial pH of solution was 7, the concentration of the catalyst was 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 or 2.5 g L−1. As shown in Fig. 2, the activity first increases with the catalyst concentration increasing from 0.1 g L−1 to 1.5 g L−1 and then decreases when the catalyst concentration is higher than 1.5 g L−1. When the catalyst concentration is 1.5 g L−1, the activity reaches the best and is 410 μmol g−1 in 6 h. This phenomenon is consistent with the observation in our other experiments [40,41]. This maybe due to the fact that: when the catalyst concentration is too low, the surface active sites are insufficient and the utilization ratio of light is low; when the catalyst concentration is too high, the catalyst would agglomerate into larger particles and affect the catalytic activity. In addition, bulk catalyst would block the incident light and reduce the efficiency of the catalyst to accept the photons. Though the magnetic stirrer has been used in the experiment from the beginning to the end, the adverse effect is still can not be avoid completely [42]. 3.1.3 Effect of the solution pH Fig. 3 shows the effect of the solution pH on the photocatalytic activities of Z scheme system when HCHO acted as organic pollutant. The concentration of organic pollutant formaldehyde was 1 mol L−1, the concentration of the catalyst was 1.5 g L−1, the initial pH of solution was 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 or 13. As shown in Fig. 3, the activity increases with the solution pH increasing from 1 to 13. The activity changes little with the solution pH increasing from 1 to 9, while the activity increases quickly when the solution pH is higher than 9. When the solution pH is 13, the activity reaches the best and is 8300 μmol g−1 in 6 h. This result shows that the strong alkaline condition is more favorable to hydrogen produce. This similar phenomenon was observed in our other works using different organic compounds as sacrificial agent, which maybe related to the catalytic role of OH− on the organic compounds. For formaldehyde, it is easier to form enol anions catalyzed by OH− under alkaline conditions, which makes it more conducive to trapping photogenerated holes. Simultaneously, the OH− could capture photogenerated hole to separate photogenerated electron. Besides, the OH− captured photogenerated hole would be oxidized to ·OH to oxidize organic compound [37,43]. The higher the solution pH, the more the ·OH generated, the activity would be better. The activity was poor under acidic conditions, it is because the acidic environment has a certain corrosive effect on the catalyst ZnIn2S4 [38,39]."
7,Photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production and degradation of organic pollutants,"3.2 Photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production and degradation of organic pollutants 3.2.1 The activity for hydrogen production and formaldehyde degradation Fig. 4 shows the photocatalytic activities of Z scheme for hydrogen production and formaldehyde degradation. The concentration of the catalyst was 1.5 g L−1, the initial pH of solution was 13, the concentration of formaldehyde was 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 mol L−1. When the initial concentration of formaldehyde in solution increases from 0.1 mol L−1 to 1 mol L−1, the hydrogen production efficiency increases rapidly. When the initial concentration of formaldehyde continues to rise from 1 mol L−1 to 5 mol L−1, the hydrogen production efficiency also improves except that its incremental is not very large, and ultimately reaches to 10,120 μmol g−1. This phenomenon is consistent with many reports in the literature [44,45]. These are because the surface active site of the catalyst is not fully utilized when the initial concentration of formaldehyde in solution is less than 1 mol L−1, the active site of the catalyst surface is fully utilized when the initial concentration of formaldehyde exceeds 1 mol L−1, and then the catalytic activity of the growth rate is small. The degradation amount of formaldehyde at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 mol L−1 were 9, 12, 20, 24, 32 and 40 mmol, respectively. It can be seen that, when the initial concentration of formaldehyde gradually increased, the degradation amount of formaldehyde is gradually increased. Apparently, the trends of formaldehyde degradation and hydrogen production are consistent, that is, the more formaldehyde degradation, the more hydrogen production. This result indicates that the increase of formaldehyde degradation promotes the hydrogen production activity of Z scheme system. The hydrogen production rate, formaldehyde degradation rate, A.Q.Y. and η c of Z scheme system under the different formaldehyde concentration are listed in Table 1 . As shown in Table 1, the A.Q.Y. and the η c are determined to be 22.9% and 13.3% when the formaldehyde concentration is 5 mol L−1. In recent years, the catalyst CdS-ZnS showed the best activity when formic acid acted as sacrificial agent and the A.Q.Y. reached 20% [46]. Obviously, the Z scheme system with graphene as the solid electron mediator in our work has a good activity in the hydrogen production and simultaneous degradation of pollutants. 3.2.2 The activity of hydrogen production and mixed organic pollutants degradation Fig. 5 shows the activity of hydrogen production and mixed organic pollutants degradation. The concentration of the catalyst was 1.5 g L−1, the initial pH of solution was 13, the compositions of the mixed organic pollutants were formaldehyde (0.5 mol L−1), methanol (0.2 mol L−1), formic acid (0.2 mol L−1), acetaldehyde (0.2 mol L−1), ethanol (0.2 mol L−1), acetic acid (0.2 mol L−1), propionaldehyde (0.1 mol L−1), butyraldehyde (0.1 mol L−1). As shown in Fig. 5, the activity of hydrogen production reached 9500 μmol g−1 in 6 h, and the degradation ratio of formaldehyde, methanol, formic acid, acetic acid, ethanol, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde and butyraldehyde reached 17%, 11%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3% and 1%. Compared with the activity of hydrogen production that just added formaldehyde (the activity reached 4300 μmol g−1 in 6 h), the activity that added mixed organic pollutants is much higher. Moreover, compared with the degradation ratio of formaldehyde that just added formaldehyde (the degradation ratio is 20%), the degradation ratio of formaldehyde that added mixed organic pollutants decreased. These results indicate that, in addition to formaldehyde, other organic pollutants were also involved in the reaction and competed for the active site. The above results show that, when the mixed organic pollutants act as a sacrificial agent, the Z scheme system also has a good activity in the hydrogen production and simultaneous degradation of mixed organic pollutants. From Fig. 5b, it also can be seen that the order of the degradation ratio is formaldehyde > methanol > formic acid > acetic acid > ethanol > acetaldehyde > propionaldehyde > butyraldehyde. This order is consistent with the activity sequence of the degradation ratio of organic compounds in Fig. 1."
8,Photocatalytic mechanism of Z scheme system for hydrogen generation and simultaneous degradation of organic pollutants,"3.3 Photocatalytic mechanism of Z scheme system for hydrogen generation and simultaneous degradation of organic pollutants From our previous work [5], we can see that the construction of Z scheme system obviously improves the hydrogen production activity of catalyst. In order to analyze the mechanism of Z scheme system for hydrogen production and simultaneous organic pollutant degradation, the activity of the hydrogen production catalyst 1.0RGO/1.0La-ZnIn2S4 and the effect of three different organic pollutants on it have been investigated (shown in Fig. 6 ). As shown in Fig. 6, the amount of hydrogen produced from water splitting (without organic pollutant) is 2.2 μmol g−1 in 6 h. Compared with this result, Z scheme system that without organic pollutant in Fig. 1 shows high activity for hydrogen production from water splitting (24 μmol g−1 in 6 h). This result indicates that the construction of Z scheme system improves the hydrogen production activity of hydrogen production catalyst, which is agreement with our observation in previous work [5]. Furthermore, in Fig. 6, the amount of hydrogen produced in the presence of three kinds of organic matter is very low (no more than 1.5 μmol g−1 in 6 h) when only 1.0RGO/1.0La-ZnIn2S4 acts as photocatalyst, which is lower than that without organic pollutants (2.2 μmol g−1 in 6 h). These results indicate that the three kinds of organic matters are almost difficult to act as sacrificial agents, which is mainly because the organic matters are difficult to be catalyzed oxidation by 1.0RGO/1.0La-ZnIn2S4. In addition, BiVO4 displayed too low activity to detect hydrogen production in previous work [5]. However, the addition of organic pollutants promoted the activity of photocatalytic hydrogen production by Z scheme system (Fig. 1). Simultaneously, the more organic pollutant degradation, the more hydrogen production (Figs. 4 and 5). Obviously, the promotion of organic compounds for ZnIn2S4 to produce hydrogen is through the oxidation of organic compounds over photocatalyst BiVO4. Therefore, the Z scheme system can promote the hydrogen generation from water splitting and organic pollutants degradation simultaneously. It is worth mentioning that organic matter consumes photogenic holes and is conducive to the separation of photoelectrons, mainly through enolated anions formed by nucleophilic reactions. Based on the above analysis, and combined with the previous Z scheme system mechanism [5], the mechanism of the Z scheme system for hydrogen generation and simultaneous degradation of organic pollutants is shown in Fig. 7 . The two photocatalysts of BiVO4 and ZnIn2S4 of Z scheme system are excited simultaneously to produce electron and hole pairs under visible light irradiation. The conduction band electrons of ZnIn2S4 would be captured by the Pt electron trap and be used to reduce water to produce hydrogen. The valence band holes of BiVO4 would be captured by the RuO2 and would react with anion of enolation. The conduction band electrons on BiVO4 would be transferred to the graphene which is covered on the surface of BiVO4. Finally, the graphene will transfer the electrons to ZnIn2S4 to recombine with the holes on ZnIn2S4."
9,Conclusions,"Z scheme system ZnIn2S4/RGO/BiVO4 can catalyze the hydrogen generation from water splitting and organic pollutants degradation simultaneously under visible light. The presence of organic pollutants can promote the hydrogen generation from decomposition of water. The activity of hydrogen production is related to the reduction properties of the organic compounds and the highest hydrogen production efficiency obtained in the presence of formaldehyde. When the formaldehyde concentration is 5 mol L−1, the concentration of the catalyst is 1.5 g L−1, the initial pH of solution is 13, the hydrogen production rate, formaldehyde degradation rate, the A.Q.Y. and the η c are determined to be 1687 μmol g−1 h−1, 22.2 mmol g−1·h−1, 22.9% and 13.3%. When mixed organic pollutants are added, the system can also have a good activity for hydrogen production and degradation of organic pollutants. The mechanism of the Z scheme system ZnIn2S4/RGO/BiVO4 for hydrogen generation and simultaneous degradation of organic pollutants was that: the conduction band electrons of ZnIn2S4 would be captured by the Pt electron trap and be used to reduce water to produce hydrogen; the valence band holes of BiVO4 would be captured by the RuO2 and would react with anion of enolation; the conduction band electrons on BiVO4 would be transferred to the graphene and the graphene will transfer the electrons to ZnIn2S4 to recombine with the holes on ZnIn2S4."
