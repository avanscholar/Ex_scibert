0,Introduction,"One-dimensional structured (1D) nanofibers are promising materials, which can be used as photocatalyst, optical sensing and protective coating materials. The electrospun method is one of the simple and effective techniques that can produce continuous nano-fibers from melts or polymer solutions. This technique has received special attention for healthcare textiles and medicine due to its effectiveness in producing nano-fibers and fibrous structures [1–3]. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as nontoxic and water-soluble polymer, due to its excellent biocompatibility, chemical resistance, biodegradability, and good fiber-forming property is widely used in practical applications [4]. The electrospun of hybrid materials consisting of polymers and nanostructured materials has attracted a great deal of attention. For example, the influence of the solutions had been investigated on the morphology as well as antimicrobial efficiency of PVA-rGO nano-fibers prepared by electrospinning technique [5–6]. One-step synthesis of transition metals incorporated in PVA nanofibers [7] and polyethylene oxide [8] was achieved where the polymer solution was used as an electrospinning template. Recently, the utilization of transition metal nanoparticles like Au, Pt, Ag in the PVA nano-fiber has been widely applied because of their uniquely promising properties [9]. Among them, Ag is the most attractive because of its low human toxicity, and strong activity against a wide spectrum of bacteria. The Ag/PVA nano-fibers can show much anti-microbial efficiency than conventional Ag/PVA micro-fibers due to their low volume ratio to surface area. For medical applications, PVA nano-fiber with metal nanostructure is more active than the large-scale modification of material [10]. This research focused on the characterization and antibacterial study of Ag/PVA nano-fibers produced by the electro-spinning technique that is a promising candidate for antimicrobial applications."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and characterization,"2.1 Materials and characterization All chemical reagents, including PVA, Ag (NO3)2, NaBH4, and starch were the analytical grade, purchased from Merck company and used without further purification. The phase formation of the prepared nano-fibers was identified using X-ray diffraction (XRD). Field-emission scanning electron microscopies (FE- SEM), as well as energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were used to study morphology and elemental analysis of the samples. FTIR spectra were taken on an AVATAR 360 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer."
3,Preparation of Ag nanoparticles,"2.2 Preparation of Ag nanoparticles 0.10 g of AgNO3 in distilled water (100 ml) was dissolved. Then, 0.05 g starch as a surfactant was added to the solution. About 2 ml of NaBH4 solution (10 g/lit) was slowly mixed to the above solution, and the solution was stirred for 15 min. In all steps the pH of the solution was 7. After that, the prepared precipitation was collected by centrifugation, washed, and dried at room temperature. The resultant weighed approximately 0.06 g."
4,Synthesis of PVA and Ag/PVA nano-fibers,"2.3 Synthesis of PVA and Ag/PVA nano-fibers First, 10 wt% of PVA water solution was prepared and placed on a magnetic stirrer for 5 h at 50 °C. Then, 0.1 g of Ag nanopowder (dispersed in 5 ml water) was added to the PVA solution (10 wt% Ag and 90 wt% PVA) by stirring for 3 h to obtain a uniformly concentrated solution. The polymeric solution was loaded into a plastic syringe (10 ml) and allowed for electrospinning. The electrospinning was carried out by applying a flow rate of 0.5 ml/h to the syringe, and 15 cm the distance between the needle tip and the collector. For Ag/PVA (PVA) nanofibers the voltage to the needle was kept 22 (18) kV."
5,Antibacterial activity study,"2.4 Antibacterial activity study A piece of prepared Ag/PVA was placed on the agar plate of microorganism solutions that had been swabbed uniformly. The dimensions of the inhibition zones around the samples were measured at 37 °C, to calculate the circle zone area."
6,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1 a displays the Ag nanoparticles diffraction pattern with Rietveld refinement fitting. All diffraction peaks at 2θ = 38.1◦, 44.2◦, 64.9◦, and 77.4◦, which indexed to (111) (200) (220) and (311) planes are matched well with face centered cubic crystal structures of Ag with the cell parameters of a = b = c = 4.085 Å, (JCPDS; # 04–0784). The crystallite size of the sample, calculated by Scherer equation [11], is found to be about 19 nm. Fig. 1b shows the XRD patterns of the electrospun PVA and Ag/PVA nano-fibers. There are two broad hump peaks at 2θ = 20° and 51° indexed as (101) and (200) planes attributed to the semi-crystallinity nature of the PVA nano-fibers. These peaks may be related to the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between PVA molecular chains. The XRD pattern of Ag/PVA nano-fibers shows extra diffraction peaks at 2θ = 38° and 77° that can be assigned to the (111) and (311) planes of FCC structure of Ag element, respectively. It is seen that for Ag/PVA fibers the peak intensity at 2θ = 20 has decreased because the coordination of PVA chains by grafted Ag nanoparticles de-escalates the intermolecular interaction of PVA chains, which results in a decreased crystallinity [12]. Fig. 1c illustrates the FT-IR spectrum of the PVA and Ag/PVA nano-fibers. From the Ag/PVA spectrum the decreasing intensity of band peaks as well as vanishing of bands at 1097, and 1367 cm−1 obviously propose the interaction that occurred between Ag NPs and back bone or side chains of PVA nano-fibers. The EDX spectrum in Fig. 1d confirmed the presence of silver on the Ag/PVA nano-fibers. Fig. 2 shows the SEM images along with the corresponding histogram diagrams of Ag nanoparticles, as well as electrospun PVA and Ag/PVA nano-fibers. Fig. 2a clearly illustrates that the Ag nanoparticles, prepared using starch as a surface-active agent, are spherical in shape. The average diameter of the nanoparticles is found to be about 21 nm. The FE-SEM image of PVA fibers displays the uniform and mono-disperse nano-fibers with average diameter size less than 440 nm (Fig. 2b). Fig. 2c confirms that the nano-fibers of Ag/PVA composite with an average diameter size of 209 nm are synthesized. The addition of Ag nanoparticles to the PVA solution decreases viscosity and as a result leads to instability of the Taylor cone on the needle. The applied voltage was increased (20 kV) in order for the Taylor cone to be stable. Increasing the voltage and decreasing the viscosity of the solution both directly lead to a reduction in fiber diameter [13]. The presence of silver nanoparticles in the polymeric fiber matrix is confirmed. Fig. 3 shows antibacterial efficacy of the prepared Ag/PVA nanocomposite. It was tested against various pathogenic bacteria of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram-negative bacteria), Shigella (Gram-negative bacteria), Escherichia coli (Gram-negative bacteria), and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive bacteria) by using the agar diffusion test. For better comparison, the blank disk on a solid agar plate and antibiotic disc as the positive control were placed beside the Ag/PVA samples. The diameter of the inhibition zones, formed around each disk, were determined and listed in Table 1 . Results show the diameter of the inhibition zones for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus are 23, 7, 11 and 7 mm, respectively. It is observed that the blank discs exhibited low antibacterial activity when compared with Ag/PVA nanocomposites. Also, the Ag/PVA nanocomposite showed better antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa rather than antibiotic disc. The antibacterial activity of silver is related to Ag+ ions that bind strongly to electron donor groups on biological molecules like oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur and by displacing other essential metal ions such as Zn2+ or Ca2+ can act against bacteria in any state of growth [14]. Results show that the Ag/PVA nano-fibers may find practical applications as antibacterial nano-fibers."
7,Conclusions,Ag nanoparticles were prepared by an easily applicable chemical reaction at room temperature. PVA nano-fiber and Ag/PVA nanocomposite were prepared by the electro-spinning method. The FE-SEM images showed that silver nanoparticles are dispersed in PVA nano-fibers. The average diameter of Ag/PVA nano-fibers was about 209 nm. The antibacterial property of Ag/PVA nanofibers against various pathogenic growth was investigated. Results showed that the electrospun Ag/PVA nanofiber can be applicable in medical applications such as wound healing material and protective coating.
