0,Introduction,"Achieving complete combustion of fuel in internal combustion engines is crucial to reducing atmospheric pollution. One approach to realizing this goal is the addition of oxygenated additives e.g. alcohols and ethers to gasoline and diesel. Additives for gasoline improve the octane rating, while those for diesel reduce both harmful emissions e.g. NOx, and carbon particulates [1]. However, the addition of alcohols is problematic [1,2], due to their water solubility, significant Reid vapor pressure, volatility, latent heat of vaporization, and their low heating values. In contrast to alcohols, ethers, offer benefits in terms of high octane numbers, enhanced gasoline combustion, and reduced CO emissions [1]. A variety of processes for producing oxygenates from glycerol are under investigation. Glycerol, formed as a byproduct of biodiesel production (in a ratio of approximately 10% mass), is becoming available as an inexpensive raw material for producing oxygenates [3–6]. In recent years, oxygenates, including the high di-ether content tert-butyl ethers of glycerol (G), manufactured by the etherification of glycerol with isobutylene; together with tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) made using homogeneous, or solid acid catalysts, have been considered as potential additives for diesel fuels [7–12]. Glycerol etherification with ethanol, over solid acid catalysts, can transform glycerol into monoalkyl glyceryl ethers (MAGEs), which are intermediates in the production of various chemicals, e.g. dioxolane [13]. The production of ‘green solvents’ by the etherification of glycerol with methanol to produce glycerol mono-methoxy ethers (GMMEs), di-methoxy ethers (GDME), and tri-methoxy ether (GTME) was highlighted in the work of Garciá et al. [14]. The production of mixed GDME and GTME oxygenate additives [15–20] offers cost advantages associated with the use of methanol, instead of isobutylene or tert-butyl alcohol, as a feedstock. Recently, the production of oxygenated additives for biodiesel fuels by glycerol etherification with n-butanol, using various solid acid catalysts, in batch processes has been systematically studied [21]. In contrast to the conventional glycerol etherification with TBA, at low temperatures, that results in a homogeneous product mixture [1, 10–12], Chang et al. [22] showed that the dehydration process when carried out at elevated temperatures results in the automatic separation of products into organic and aqueous phases. After distillation of the organic phase, the distillate obtained at 225 °C was able be used to boost the octane rating of gasoline, while the residue could be used in diesel fuel. For these systems, the dominant reactions are those involving dehydration between glycerol and the alcohols, or their derivatives. To design a process for the production of useful materials from glycerol/alcohol dehydration reactions, a reliable kinetic model is needed. However, it is hard to obtain pure samples of the newly synthesized ethers or unknown components and the peak quantization of gas chromatograph (GC) measurements of these components is not possible. Therefore, building a reliable kinetic model is not as straight forward as a conventional problem in which all the components of a product mixture have representative pure standards. The main objective of this work was to develop an effective parameter estimation method to tackle glycerol/alcohol dehydration reaction systems with incomplete GC data sets. Fortunately, such problems can be addressed by embedding the carbon–hydrogen–oxygen (CHO) balance optimization within the reaction system's parameters estimation. In the following section, a computational algorithm is developed as a two-stage parameter estimation technique that can be applied to ordinary differential equation models (Chang et al. [23]). Section 3 discusses in detail an optimization approach for obtaining the CHO balance of the reaction system, while Section 4 demonstrates the applicability of the developed system by simulating the synthesis of glycerol ether from glycerol and TBA. The same method is then used with an experimental system involving glycerol/TBA dehydration at an elevated temperature [22]."
1,The two-stage parameter estimation method [23],"A reliable process model, employing accurate parameter estimation, is crucially important for the extraction of information from raw data. Obtaining proper parameter values requires reliable parameter estimation techniques. The models that describe underlying process behavior, within defined initial and boundary conditions, may be presented in the form of algebraic, differential, or integral equations. Among the models, ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or differential–algebraic equations (DAEs) are widely used to model dynamic processes in natural science disciplines spanning biology to engineering [2]. The most frequently used statistical techniques employed to obtain the parameters of an input-output model employ least-squares (linear or non-linear) regression. This approach, which minimizes the objective function with respect to known parameters, commonly uses the sum of the squared differences, i.e. between the measured values and the model's predictions. Varah [24] developed an alternative parameter estimation technique, not requiring repeated solution of the ODEs, which is based on the works of Swartz and Bremermann [25], and Benson [26]. In this approach, together with a related technique, known as ‘principal differential analysis’ (PDA) [27], discrete measurements of the output variables, y, are fitted empirically using splines that can be differentiated with respect to time, to give estimated time-derivative curves. This time-derivative information is substituted into the ODEs, thereby converting the estimation of parameters, from a relatively difficult dynamic optimization problem, into a comparatively simple algebraic optimization operation that can be solved using either linear, nonlinear, or least-squares methods depending on the linearity of the ODEs in the parameters. PDA techniques [24,26] differ from the often used nonlinear least-squares methods for dynamic models, and also from an earlier spline-based method [28] and its iterative extension as given by Madar et al. [29]. In PDA, the parameter values are selected to minimize squared residuals in the differential form of the model, rather than in the traditional integrated form. The advantage in applying the PDA method to obtain near optimal estimated parameters for ODEs is that the parameter values are selected to minimize squared residuals in the differential form of the model and not its traditional integrated form. The occurring of ill-conditioning, which may have been apparent when integrating the system equations, means that the method based on the integrated form will no longer apply. Hence a two-stage (TS) parameter estimation for differential equations is proposed, including a first stage to obtain near optimal estimated parameters by the PDA method to be used as initial guesses for the second stage. In the second stage, differential equation parameter estimation by the well-established non-linear regression framework [30], requiring integration of the system equations is performed. Using simulation experiments, an easy-to-use two-stage parameter estimation algorithm for differential equations has been developed by Chang et al. [23]."
2,Initial parameter estimation for ODEs using the PDA method (stage I),"2.1 Initial parameter estimation for ODEs using the PDA method (stage I) Considering processes described by ODE models of the following form. (1) d x ( t ) d t = f ( x ( t ) , u , k ) (2) y ( t ) = C x ( t ) + ɛ Where: k = [ k 1 , k 2 , … , k p ] T is a p-dimensional vector of parameters with unknown numerical values; x ( t ) = [ x 1 , x 2 , … , x n ] T is an n-dimensional vector of state variables; x 0 = [ x 10 , x 20 , … , x n 0 ] T is an n-dimensional vector representing the initial conditions for the state variables which are assumed to be known precisely; u = [ u 1 , u 2 , . . . , u r ] T is an r-dimensional vector of manipulated variables, either estimated, or definite if the numerical values are known e.g. from measurements; f = [ f 1 , f 2 , . . . , f n ] T is an n-dimensional vector function of known form (the differential equations); while y = [ y 1 , y 2 , . . . , y m ] T is the m-dimensional output vector, i.e., the set of variables that is measured experimentally; C is the m×n observation matrix, y = C x + ɛ ; and ɛ is a random vector. Another important consideration is how to select the appropriate objective function. In general, the unknown parameter vector k is found by minimizing a scalar function, often termed the objective function, which can be thought of as representing the overall difference between the model-calculated-values and the measured values. A suitable objective function to be to minimized is given by the equation, (3) S ( k ) = [ ∑ i = 1 N [ y ^ i − y ( t i , k ) ] T Q i [ y ^ i − y ( t i , k ) ] ] Where: S( k ) represents the objective function, k = [ k 1 , k 2 , … , k p ] T is a p-dimensional vector representing parameters with unknown values, y ^ i are the experimentally measured values, y (ti , k )are the model calculated output values, Q i is an m × m user specified weighting matrix, and N is the number of experimentally measured values for each run. The weighting matrix Q i should be chosen, such that the parameter estimates have appropriate or desirable statistical properties. If the error terms ( ɛ i ) are normally distributed with zero as the mean and with a known covariance matrix ∑ i , then Q i is the inverse of this covariance matrix [31]. Instead of adopting Eq. (3) as the objective function, the PDA approach [32] suggested an alternative objective function to be minimized: (4) S ( k ) = λ T ∫ ∥ ( C x ˜ ˙ − C f ( x ˜ ( t ) , u , k ) ) ∥ 2 d t Where: λ is the weighting vector of the ODEs. The discrete measurements y ^ i can be fitted into a smooth function of time y ˜ i ( t ) by determining suitable values for the spline weighting coefficients. In the approach developed in this work, these spline weighting coefficients are not augmented with k as the unknown parameters in minimizing the objective function (Eq. (3) or (4)) as was done in the work of Poyton et al. [32], thus an explicit equation for y ˜ i ( t ) is not required. In Eq. (4), (5) x ˜ = B y ˜ (6) x ˜ ˙ = B y ˜ ˙ where B = ( C T C ) − 1 C T and x ˜ ˙ = d x ˜ / d t . Eq. (4) is then approximated as: (7) S ( k ) = λ 1 T ∑ i = 1 L [ [ C x ˜ ˙ − C f ( x ˜ , u , k ) ] i T [ C x ˜ ˙ − C f ( x ˜ , u , k ) ] i ] Where: L is the total number of points used for approximating the continuous integration from discrete values; while λ 1 is the corresponding weighting vector. The Matlab function “lsqnonlin” was used to solve nonlinear least-squares problems of the form: (8) min k ( 1 2 ∥ G ( k ) ∥ ) = 1 2 ∑ i = 1 L g i ( k ) 2 In which G ( k ) = [ g 1 , … , g L ] T and Eq. (8) is the discrete version of Eq. (7). The initial guesses for implementing “lsqnonlin” were obtained from the uniform distributive points of the parameter ( k ) spaces. The uniform design (UD) method was used to obtain these uniform distributive points using the UD tables provided by Fang and Ma [33]. They are expressed asUn (qs ), where U stands for uniform design, n is the number of experimental trials, q is the number of levels and s is the maximum number of factors. Briefly, one system has s factors, each of which is divided into q levels by the UD method that requires q experiments (n ≤ q). Alternatively, the Morris–Mitchell optimal Latin hypercube sampling method (bestlh.m) developed by Forrester et al. [34] for these initial guesses can also be used. This sampling plan was developed using the random hypercube generator as an optimization process starting point, following which the space-filling metric was optimized [35]. To obtain uniform design points by the script of bestlh.m, four inputs, namely the number of: design points required, design variables, individuals in the evolutionary operation optimizer, and generations of the evolutionary process need to be specified. High values for the last two inputs will ensure high quality hypercubes, but the search will be more protracted. The output of bestlh.m is the optimized Latin hypercube [34]. For the same four inputs, different optimized Latin hypercubes from different runs are obtained. However, which one is the most useful cannot be known in advance. No integration of ODEs is required when implementing “lsqnonlin” at this stage; thus, there will be no system integrating problems arising that originate from ill-conditioning. The estimated parameters k IG obtained from minimizing Eq. (7) were adopted as initial guesses for the minimization problem Eq. (4) to obtain the final estimated parameters of the defined problem."
3,Nonlinear parameter estimation for ODEs using the estimated parameters from the PDA method (stage II),"2.2 Nonlinear parameter estimation for ODEs using the estimated parameters from the PDA method (stage II) The nonlinear parameter estimation problem for an ODE system is now formulated as: (9) min k S ( k ) = [ ∑ i = 1 N [ y ^ i − y ( t i , k ) ] T Q i [ y ^ i − y ( t i , k ) ] ] such that Eqs. (1) and (2) are satisfied. The decision as to which non-linear parameter estimation method to use is dependent on the nature of the errors. The least squares approach can be employed if nothing is known about the errors; however, the maximum likelihood approach should be adopted if for example the covariance of errors is known. If both error and parameter covariance can be deduced, a maximum a posteriori estimate can be used. In the present work, the ‘error status’ was unknown, therefore by iteratively integrating Eq. (1) using the Matlab function “lsqnonlin” with initial guesses for the unknown parameters bound by the estimated parameters obtained in Stage I the nonlinear least-squares problem was able to be solved, see Eq. (9). UD tables can provide initial guesses for a region bound by the estimated parameters from Stage I - this approach again means that problems associated with ill-conditioning, stemming from difficulties in integrating the system equations, no longer apply. The final estimated parameters from Stage II, with confidence intervals (∼95%), can be calculated with the Matlab function “nlparci,” after calculation of the coefficient estimates, residuals, and estimated coefficient covariance matrix. A schematic of the TS method for parameter estimation is shown in Fig. 1 with details of the TS parameter estimation procedure being given in the appendix."
4,Quantization of the unknown components based on optimizing the CHO balance of the dehydration reactions in a batch reactor,"In a batch reaction, the initial feed contains N G0 moles of glycerol and N A0moles of a specific alcohol. During the reaction, N P i ( i = 1 , . . . , n ) moles of the products formed i are estimated by GC measurements using those purified components that are available. The weight fractions w j ( j = 1 , . . . , m ) of the unavailable purified components can be estimated by the script of fmincon.m to find the minimum of constrained nonlinear multivariable function at a sampling time: (10) min w j | j = 1 , . . m ( ( N C − N C * ) 2 + ( N H − N H * ) 2 + ( N O − N O * ) 2 ) such that { ∑ j = 1 m w j = w * and l b ≤ w j ≤ u b in which N k | k = C , H , O = ∑ j = 1 m w j W t M w j n k , j ; N k | k = C , H , O * = N k 0 − ∑ i n N k , i ; Wt is total mass dosed; Mwj is the molecular weight of jth purified component and n k, j is the number of C (or H or O) in the jth purified component that is unavailable. The Matlab function “fmincon,” was implemented for this optimization problem."
5,A simulation example: glycerol ether synthesis from glycerol and TBA,"This simulation example demonstrates how to quantify the unavailable components based on the CHO balance optimization. The estimated quantities are used to obtain parameters for the proposed kinetic model using the TS parameter estimation method. The batch reactions occurring during the etherification of glycerol with TBA are [36]: (11) G + TBA ⟷ k − 1 k 1 MTBG + H 2 O (12) MTBG + TBA ⟷ k − 2 k 2 DTBG + H 2 O (13) DTBG + TBA ⟷ k − 3 k 3 TTBG + H 2 O (14) TBA → k 4 IB + H 2 O Material balance of the reactions in a batch reactor leads to the following expressions. (15) d m G d t = − r 1 (16) d m TBA d t = − r 1 − r 2 − r 3 − r 4 (17) d m MTBG d t = r 1 − r 2 (18) d m DTBG d t = r 2 − r 3 (19) d m TTBG d t = r 3 (20) d m H 2 O d t = r 1 + r 2 + r 3 + r 4 (21) d m IB d t = r 4 The rate functions r i = 1 ∼ 4 in Eqs. (15)–(21) are (22) r 1 = k 1 · ( x G · x TBA − 1 K e q 1 · x MTBG · x H 2 O ) · W c (22) r 2 = k 2 · ( x MTBG · x TBA − 1 K e q 2 · x DTBG · x H 2 O ) · W c (23) r 3 = k 3 · ( x DTBG · x TBA − 1 K e q 3 · x TTBG · x H 2 O ) · W c (24) r 4 = k 4 · x TBA · W c The rate constants k i = 1 ∼ 4 and equilibrium constants K e q i = 1 ∼ 3 = k i / k − i are shown in Table 1 , in which the following abbreviations are used: mole fraction of species i (xi ); 1-mono-tert-butyl ether of glycerol (MTBG); 1,3-di-tert-butyl ether of glycerol (DTGB); tri-tert-butyl ether of glycerol (TTBG); and W c is the weight of catalyst dosed. In this example, Amberlyst 15 was used as a solid acid catalyst. The operating conditions were as follows: molar ratio of TBA to G (4); four isothermal reaction temperatures were used ( T = 60 ∘ C , T = 70 ∘ C , T = 80 ∘ C , and T = 90 ∘ C ); catalyst loading (5wt% of glycerol dosed); G dosed (20.5 g). Three simulations using different data sets were used to test the TS method in estimating the unknown parameters of the kinetic model described by Eqs. (11)–(24). In the first test (case 1) the measurements were noise-free and there was no missing GC data for MTBG, DTBG, and TTBG. The second test (case 2) was noise-free in the measurements but lacked GC data for MTBG, DTBG, and TTBG. In the final test (case 3) the data comprised noise-corrupted measurements (ɛ = 5% of the mean value of each measurable component) and also the GC data for MTBG, DTBG, TTBG was missing. Using the TS method with tuning parameters ( N p 1 = 5, N p 2 = 5, nc = 1), the individual estimated rate constants k i = 1 ∼ 4 and the estimated equilibrium constants K e q i = 1 ∼ 3 = k i / k − i for four isothermal reaction temperatures were obtained. Using an Intel (R) Core (TM) i7-3770 central processing unit (CPU) in a personal computer, only 42 s (CPU) time for each isothermal reaction temperature determination were needed. By taking the Arrhenius plot, the estimated rate constants and equilibrium constants for these four isothermal reaction temperatures for case 1 (noise-free and no-missing GC data) are shown in Table 2 . Using the same procedure the estimated equilibrium constant and rate constant for case 2 (noise-free and non-missing of the GC data) were determined, see Table 3 . Table 4 gives the estimated equilibrium and rate constants for case 3 (noise-free and missing GC data). Figs. 2 and 3 show the corresponding Arrhenius plots of Tables 2–4. From Tables 1 to 4 or Figs. 2 and 3, one can see that the estimated parameters of case 1 slightly deviate from the actual values, and that the deviations increase for case 2 with missing GC data for MTBG, DTBG, and TTBG. The deviations grow further for case 3 with missing GC data for MTBG, DTBG, TTBG, and noise-corrupted measurements. Based on the estimated parameters given in Table 2, Fig. 4 depicts the simulated experimental data for the components in comparison with model-calculated values. Standard deviations calculated for the relative percent errors ((state-model estimate)/state×100%) along each component profile for case 1 is shown in Table 6. One can find the standard deviations are small for all the components, except those for TTBG at 70 and 80 °C. The simulated experimental data of case 1 was noise-free and did not have missing GC data. Therefore, the estimated parameters are closer to those of the original assumed parameters used in the simulator, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3 or Tables 1 and 2. Based on optimizing the CHO balance for quantizing the unknown components (Eq. (10)) and the TS method, the data of case 2 were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The simulated measurements (case 2) were free of noise. The estimated quantities of the missing components MTBG, DTBG, and TTBG are shown in Fig. 5(a). The estimated quantities are close to their actual values, allowing tracking of the total moles of C, H, and O as shown in Fig. 5(b). Figs. 5 and 6(c)–(e) compare simulated experimental data for the components with model-calculated values at four isothermal reaction temperatures and show that the model-calculated values acceptably track those of the simulated measurements. Standard deviations, calculated for the relative percent errors along each component profile, for case 2 are shown in Table 7. One can find most of the standard deviations are larger than those for case 1 (Table 6), due to incomplete information with respect to the components MTBG, DTBG, and TTBG. Using the same methods (the CHO balance method and the TS method), the data of case 3 was used to evaluate the capability of the proposed method in a more practical situation. The simulated triplicate measurements (case 3) were noise-corrupted, and the GC data for MTBG, DTBG, TTBG was also missing. The estimated quantities of the missing components MTBG, DTBG, and TTBG are shown in Fig. 6(a). The estimated quantities are not all close to their correct values. However, tracking of the total moles of C, H, and O to their true values was all achieved (Fig. 6(b)). Fig. 6(c)–(e) depict the simulated experimental data of the actual components in comparison with model-calculated values for the four isothermal reaction temperatures. And similarly to the previous example because the model-calculated values still track those of the simulated measurements, the result is acceptable. Standard deviations, calculated for the relative percent errors along each component profile for case 3, are shown in Table 8. One can find most of the standard deviations are larger than those for cases 1 and 2 (Tables 6 and 7), due to incomplete information with respect to components MTBG, DTBG, and TTBG and the available noise-corrupted measurements. Therefore, the quality of the measurements for all of the reacting components will usually play an important role in building a reliable kinetic model, especially when the model has a large number of reacting species. The performance of the TS method based on the reconstruction of the missing GC components was found to be acceptable with the simulated cases, as shown above. We now examined the ability of the proposed method to deal with genuine experimental data."
6,Glycerol ether synthesis from glycerol with tert-butyl alcohol at elevated temperatures [22],"The dehydration of glycerol with TBA was carried out in a 50 cm3 stainless steel ‘‘sampler’’ (Swagelok, Taiwan) using a shaking frequency of 1250/min (Mix-Evr, Taitec Ltd.) to minimize the influence of external mass transfer. We used Amberlyst-70 (A-70) as a solid acid catalyst and the following experimental conditions, under autogenic pressures: molar ratio of TBA to G (2); four isothermal reaction temperatures ( T = 170 ∘ C , T = 180 ∘ C , and T = 190 ∘ C ); catalyst loading (10wt% of glycerol dosed); glycerol dosed (10.51 g). A weighed amount of glycerol, TBA, and A-70 were placed in a nitrogen flushed reactor and heated, during a period of 10 min, to a pre-determined temperature. The reactor was cooled to 5 °C using an ice-bath at which point the vapor pressure of the mixture was equilibrated to that of the atmosphere, thereby allowing the volatile gas phase components to condense into the liquid phase. The resulting product automatically separated into separate organic and aqueous phases after cooling and settling. This feature shows that our approach is different from the conventional etherification of glycerol with TBA, in which the product mixture is usually in a homogeneous state [1, 10, 11,12]. A GC (CHINA GC2000), with a capillary column [Varian CP9210 (l, 30 m; i.d., 0.32 mm; film thickness, 0.5 mm)] in a temperature controlled oven programmed from 40 to 250 °C (heating rate 10 °C/min) and held at 250 °C for 3 min, was used to analyze reaction product samples (0.2 µl). Each data set had an accuracy of ± 3%, determined using n-butanol, 2 wt.% as an internal standard, from an average of three independent measurements. Water contents were measured using a Karl Fisher Titrator, MKS-500. For quantification of the reaction product, standards, namely: 2,2,4-trimethyl-1-pentene, 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene (DIBs), 2,2,4,6-pentamethyl-3-heptene, and 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-methyleneheptane (TIBs) were purchased from Alfa Aesar and TCI. The product mixture contained the following identifiable components: TBA, isobutylene (IB), DIBs, and TIBs. The remainder of the product mixture could not be confirmed using the existing GC-MS databank because the qualities of the suggested components for these unknown moieties were very low. Therefore, these unidentified components were lumped together as a pseudo-compound. This pseudo-compound was denoted as oxygen-limited hydrocarbons (HCs) because the mass fraction of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, based on elemental analysis (Heraeus Vario EL III) was 0.82:0.11:0.7. The corresponding mole fractions were 0.38:0.60:0.02 [22]. Among several possible reaction schemes, the following sequence fitted the experimental data to an acceptable level. (25) TBA ⟷ k − 1 k 1 IB + H 2 O (26) TBA + IB ⟷ k − 2 k 2 DIB + H 2 O (27) TBA + 2 IB ⟷ k − 3 k 3 TIB + H 2 O (28) 2 G + IB ⟷ k − 4 k 4 C 10 H 20 O 4 + 2 H 2 O (29) G + DIB ⟷ k − 5 k 5 C 11 H 18 + 3 H 2 O (30) 2 G + TBA ⟷ k − 6 k 6 C 10 H 20 O 4 + 3 H 2 O Material balance of the reactions in a batch reactor leads to the following expressions. (31) d m G d t = − 2 r 4 − r 5 − 2 r 6 (32) d m TBA d t = r 1 + r 2 + r 3 − r 6 (33) d m H 2 O d t = − r 1 − r 2 − r 3 + 2 r 4 + 3 r 5 + 3 r 6 (34) d m IB d t = − r 1 + r 2 + 2 r 3 − r 4 (35) d m DIB d t = − r 2 − r 5 (36) d m TIB d t = − r 3 (37) d m HCS − 1 d t = r 4 + r 6 (38) d m HCS − 2 d t = r 5 The rate functions r i = 1 ∼ 6 in Eqs. (31)–(38) are (39) r 1 = − k 1 · ( x TBA − 1 K e q 1 · x IB · x H 2 O ) · W c (40) r 2 = − k 2 · ( x TBA · x IB − 1 K e q 2 · x DIB · x H 2 O ) · W c (41) r 3 = − k 3 · ( x TBA · x IB 2 − 1 K e q 3 · x TIB · x H 2 O ) · W c (42) r 4 = k 4 · ( x G 2 · x IB − 1 K e q 4 · x HCs − 1 · x H 2 O 2 ) · W c (43) r 5 = k 5 · ( x G · x DIB − 1 K e q 5 · x HCs − 2 · x H 2 O 3 ) · W c (44) r 6 = k 6 · ( x G 2 · x TBA − 1 K e q 6 · x HCS − 1 · x H 2 O 3 ) · W c The equilibrium constants are K e q i = k i / k − i . In the case of the simulation example shown in the previous section, the components were known and quantized using the CHO optimization algorithm. In this experimental system, the components (HCs-1) and (HCs-2) were used to represent the unknown species (HCs). These two components were suggested by GC-mass analysis of the product mixture. Using the same methods (i.e. the CHO balance method and the TS method), the experimental data for the dehydration reactions of glycerol and TBA were used to examine the performance of the proposed method. The estimated rate and equilibrium constants for these three isothermal reaction temperatures are shown in Table 5. The experimental measurements with T = 170 ∘ C were noise-corrupted, thus no existing standards could be used to calibrate the HCs GC data. The estimated quantities of the missing components HCs-1 and HCs-2 are shown in Fig. 7(a). The estimated quantities cannot be compared with to their actual values as they are unknown; however, tracking the total moles of C, H, and O to their expected values was partially achieved (Fig. 7(b)). Fig. 7(c) compares experimental data for the components with model-calculated values. Because the model-calculated values track most of the simulated measurements, the results are acceptable. Figs. 8 and 9 depict similar results for isothermal reactions carried out at T = 180 ∘ C and T = 190 ∘ C . HCs contain many components, from which HCs-1 and HCs-2 have been used to represent the HCs contents, which in practice may be insufficient. Therefore, the proposed scheme as represented by Eqs. (25)–(30)) may be inadequate to represent the real situation. However, the results represented in Figs. 7–9 show that the developed model grasps the main dynamics of the experimental reaction system."
7,Conclusions,"The TS method, which embeds the carbon–hydrogen–oxygen (CHO) balance optimization algorithm, can be successfully used for parameter estimation in dehydration reaction systems involving glycerol with alcohols, for which there is incomplete chromatography data. The TS method is simple, easy to apply, and robust in its ability to estimate unknown parameters. Initial guess values over large regions were chosen to implement the first stage of the TS algorithm. Using stage I of the TS method, the problem of ill-conditioning encountered in integrating the system-equations can be obviated. In this work, we have shown that systems with seven parameters (the simulation example) as well as twelve parameters (the experimental example) can be solved efficiently by the proposed method. However, when using the kinetic model with more complex systems, especially those that result from the need to consider larger numbers of reacting species, the quality of the measurement data used for the calculations will obviously become more crucial to the model's accuracy."
