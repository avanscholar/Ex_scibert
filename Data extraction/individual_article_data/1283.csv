0,Introduction,"Photosynthetic organisms are of increasing interest as sustainable chemical production platforms due to their ability to directly convert CO2 into compounds of interest, bypassing traditional fermentation feedstocks with more direct and efficient CO2 and energy utilization (Abed et al., 2009; Angermayr et al., 2009; Stephens et al., 2021). Certain members of the cyanobacteria show particular promise for renewable chemical production due to their relatively rapid growth, tractable genetics, and availability of synthetic biology tools (Heidorn et al., 2011; Ruffing, 2011). Cyanobacteria have been engineered to produce a diverse range of chemicals including alcohols and aldehydes (Atsumi et al., 2009; Kusakabe et al., 2013; Lan and Liao, 2011), terpenoids (Davies et al., 2014; Englund et al., 2014), sugar alcohols (Jacobsen and Frigaard, 2014; Savakis et al., 2015), and hydrogen (Gutthann et al., 2007), among others. However, cyanobacteria that have been engineered to produce chemicals of interest frequently suffer from various issues, including product toxicity, genetic instability, and relatively low product titers and productivities (Angermayr et al., 2015; Jones, 2014; Oliver and Atsumi, 2014). Specifically regarding the poor production that is frequently seen in these strains, the issue likely often stems from the vastly different metabolism of cyanobacteria compared to more traditional heterotrophic production strains (Nogales et al., 2013). Because of their unique, photosynthetic metabolism, cyanobacteria may require novel metabolic engineering approaches to construct production strains that more closely match their heterotrophic counterparts. With regard to identifying such approaches, genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) are well-established as tools for strain design that take into account the total metabolic network of the engineered strain (Long et al., 2015; O'Brien et al., 2015). As such, the use of GEMs for designing cyanobacterial production strains can help elucidate metabolic engineering strategies that work with or around the unique aspects of cyanobacterial metabolism (Erdrich et al., 2014; Knoop et al., 2013; Nogales et al., 2012). In a previous study (Vu et al., 2013), our group reconstructed a GEM for the fast-growing model cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 (hereafter referred to as “PCC 7002”). PCC 7002 is notable as a cyanobacterial production chassis because of its fast and robust growth, including the ability to grow at temperatures and salinities beyond those of most other model cyanobacteria (Clark et al., 2018). As part of the previous GEM reconstruction study, a preliminary assessment of PCC 7002's capabilities as a background strain for chemical production was performed using the metabolic model. In this work, we revisit the PCC 7002 GEM to perform a more in-depth analysis of potential strain designs for the production of various biofuel alcohols that are produced via engineered variants of the non-fermentative, branched-alcohols pathway (Atsumi et al., 2008), such as isobutanol and 2-methyl-1-butanol. These alcohols were identified in our previous work as having the potential for metabolic coupling to improve production. Here, our computational assessment identifies that the introduction of a large NADH-demand into PCC 7002's metabolic network is predicted to improve production of the target alcohols by enhancing flux through upstream reactions. We further computationally identify that replacement of PCC 7002's native ferredoxin-dependent nitrite reductase with an NADH-dependent enzyme can be used to implement the large NADH-demand required by our production strategy. We experimentally construct strains of PCC 7002 to test this approach and verify that implementing an NADH-dependent nitrate assimilation pathway in the cyanobacterium improves production of several branched-chain alcohols relative to production in a WT background."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Metabolic modeling,"2.1 Metabolic modeling The genome-scale metabolic model iSyp708 (Vu et al., 2013) was used to perform strain design and analysis in this study. In all calculations, the model was modified from its published form as follows: the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase reaction (r_FDNOR) was corrected to be reversible (Thomas et al., 2006), the type-I NADH dehydrogenase reaction (r_NADHPQ9) was corrected to utilize reduced-ferredoxin (m_fdxr_2_2_c) instead of NADH (Peltier et al., 2016), and the bidirectional hydrogenase (r_HDH1 and r_HDH2) and pyruvate synthase (r_POR) reactions were constrained to have zero flux as these reactions are oxygen-sensitive and inactive under the modeled oxygenic photosynthetic conditions (Cournac et al., 2004; McNeely et al., 2011). The modeled culture conditions were based on our group's previous work (Vu et al., 2013) and assumed carbon-limited growth in Media A+. As such, CO2 uptake was constrained to be less than or equal to 10mmol/gDW/hr, while photon uptake was unconstrained as was the uptake of the various components of Media A+. For calculations involving biofuel production, the various alpha-keto acid decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase reactions were added to the model to enable the conversion of 2-ketobutyrate, 2-ketovalerate, 2-ketoisovalerate, 2-ketoisocaproate, and 2-keto-3-methyl-valerate into 1-propanol, 1-butanol, isobutanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, and 2-methyl-1-butanol, respectively. Additionally, reactions from the norvaline biosynthesis pathway were added to the model to enable the synthesis of 2-ketovalerate from 2-ketobutyrate. Finally, for calculations involving the presence of the NADH-dependent nitrate assimilation pathway, the nitrate reductase (r_NTRARFDX) and nitrite reductase (r_NTRIRFDX) reactions were removed and replaced with the reactions [NADH+H++NO3 −→NAD++H2O + NO2 −] and [3NADH+5H++NO2 −→3NAD++2H2O + NH4 +], respectively. All computations were performed using GAMS (GAMS Development Corporation, Washington, DC) with the CPLEX solver. The initial strain design approach described in this study used the established algorithm OptKnock (Burgard et al., 2003). Specifically, OptKnock is formulated as a bilevel mixed-integer linear program with the outer objective set to maximize the production of each target compound via reaction knockouts subject to an inner Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) biomass-maximization problem modeling the strain's flux distribution in response to those knockouts. As described elsewhere, the OptKnock problem can be made computationally tractable by reformulating it as a single-level MILP using the dual of the inner problem (Burgard et al., 2003). In the initial round of strain design, OptKnock was applied individually for each target alcohol to identify knockout sets of 10 or fewer reactions that maximized production of the target. These OptKnock solutions were interrogated using FBA to test the individual and combined effects of the identified knockouts on the metabolic network's flux distributions. In the second round of OptKnock (incorporating NADH-dependent nitrate assimilation), the nitrate and nitrite reductase reactions were altered as described above and the glutamate dehydrogenase (r_GLUDY) and glutamate synthase (r_GLUSZ) reactions were excluded from the set of allowed knockouts. To identify which reactions in the model consumed the largest amount of non-NADH reducing power under a WT flux distribution, first, we identified those redox reactions in the model that consumed (or produced, if the reaction was reversible) any of the following metabolites: NADPH (m_nadph_c), ferredoxin (m_fdxr_2_2_c), cytochrome c 6 (m_cyc6_rd_c), glutathione (m_gthrd_c), thioredoxin (m_trdrd_c), FADH2 (m_fadh2_c), and plastiquinol-9 (m_pq9h2_c). Next, standard FBA was run to identify the maximum biomass flux for the network. Then, with the biomass flux fixed at its maximum value, the fluxes through each of the identified redox reactions were individually minimized in the reducing direction, i.e. the direction that consumed one of the above listed reducing cofactors, to determine the minimum amount of reductant consumption from each reaction necessary to achieve maximum growth. Finally, the redox reactions were ordered by the NADH-equivalents that they consumed at this minimum required flux. Note that reactions involved in the photosynthetic electron transport chain were not included in this final ordering of reactions because they are ultimately the source of reducing-power in PCC 7002's metabolic network and it would not make sense to identify them as reductant sinks in the context of this work."
3,Strain and plasmid construction,"2.2 Strain and plasmid construction 2.2.1 General culture and cloning conditions Strains of Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 containing the native nitrite reductase gene (nirA) were propagated and cloned on standard Media A+ (nitrate-containing media) (Ludwig and Bryant, 2011). Unless otherwise noted, strains with modifications to their nitrite reductase locus (e.g. ΔnirA and ΔnirA∷nasDE) were propagated and cloned on ammonia media (Media A+ with 5 mM ammonium chloride instead of sodium nitrate) due to their reduced growth on nitrate media and to avoid unwanted selection at the modified locus. Unless otherwise noted, PCC 7002 liquid cultures were grown at 37 °C in a 1% CO2 environment with a light intensity of ∼75 μmol photons m−2 s−2 using a Kuhner Climo-Shaker ISF1-X fitted with white LED panels. Cyanobacterial agar plate cultures were grown at 37 °C in air under white fluorescent lights. All plasmids were constructed using standard Gibson Assembly. E. coli DH5α was used for cloning and storage of plasmids. For transformations in PCC 7002, which is naturally competent, 1 mL of overnight liquid culture was incubated for ∼12 h with 1 μg of plasmid DNA containing the desired insertion sequence between ∼500 bp homology arms targeted around the genomic region to be replaced/deleted. These transformation mixtures were then plated on the appropriate selective media and subsequent colonies were tested for both transformation and chromosomal segregation using standard colony PCR. If no homozygous transformants were found after the first pass, then one or more heterozygous transformants were re-streaked on selective media and tested until a homozygous strain was identified. Successful knockouts/integrations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the modified genomic loci. 2.2.2 Construction of ΔnirA∷nasDE strains To construct PCC 7002 strains containing the NADH-dependent nitrite reductase from Bacillus subtilis, first the native nitrite reductase, nirA, was removed using a knockout cassette containing a spectinomycin resistance gene. Once nirA was knocked out, the nasDE operon from B. subtilis genomic DNA was cloned into a plasmid containing homology arms targeting the (former) nirA locus, and this construct was then transformed into the ΔnirA strain. The transformation was plated on nitrate-media to select for the nasDE integration, as the ΔnirA strain could not grow on nitrate as a nitrogen source. The colonies that grew up were confirmed to be homozygous for nasDE in the nirA locus. To confirm the inserted nasDE operon sequence, the nirA locus from three of the ΔnirA∷nasDE transformant colonies was PCR amplified and sequenced, which verified that the insertion was as intended. One of the verified transformants was transferred to 100 mL of liquid nitrate-media culture and took approximately 8 days to reach an OD730 of 1, which is substantially slower than WT PCC 7002 growth. As such, the ΔnirA∷nasDE strain was passaged on nitrate-media to select for faster growth and to determine if any growth improvements resulted from changes in the introduced nasDE genes. For the passaging, the ΔnirA∷nasDE culture was re-suspended to an OD730 of 0.05 in 100 mL of fresh nitrate-media and allowed to grow up to an OD730 of ∼1.0, at which point it was again passaged. By the 4th passage, the culture displayed significantly improved growth, taking approximately 24 h to reach an OD730 of 1. This culture was plated on nitrate-media and the nirA locus from 3 of resulting colonies was sequenced. All three colonies contained the same point mutation in the 5’ UTR of the introduced nasDE operon (Fig. S2). A “clean” (i.e. not passaged) ΔnirA∷nasDE strain containing the identified point mutation was reconstructed by cloning out the nasDE operon from one of the passaged ΔnirA∷nasDE isolates and transforming it into the ΔnirA strain as described above. 2.2.3 Construction of alcohol production strains To construct strains containing the pathways for producing the desired branched-chain alcohols, first the plasmids pSA150 and pCS129 (Shen and Liao, 2012), containing kivD yqhD and cimA leuBCD operons, respectively, were obtained from the Liao Lab. The genes from these two plasmids were cloned into a single operon, kivD yqhD cimA leuBCD, and placed into an expression cassette under the control of the synthetic IPTG-inducible cLac143 promoter (Markley et al., 2014), with homology arms targeting PCC 7002's glpK locus. This expression construct was transformed into strains of WT and ΔnirA∷nasDE as described above."
4,Growth characterization of ΔnirA∷nasDE strains,"2.3 Growth characterization of ΔnirA∷nasDE strains To compare the growth of the various ΔnirA∷nasDE strains against each other and against WT PCC 7002, biological triplicates of each strain were precultured in 50 mL of nitrate-media for ∼24 h at 37 °C and 1% CO2, and then transferred to 100 mL of fresh nitrate-media at an OD730 of 0.05. These cultures were grown under the same conditions as the precultures and had their OD730 measured daily. The absorbance spectra of the cultures were also measured at each timepoint of the growth curve. To do this, 100 μL of diluted cultures were placed in a 96-well plate and the absorbance spectra from 350 nm to 750 nm were measured using a Tecan Infinite M200 plate reader (Tecan Group Ltd., Switzerland). The average normalized absorbance spectrum of each strain was obtained by first subtracting out the background absorbance of the media at each wavelength, then normalizing each spectrum to the culture density using ( A λ − A 730 − 750 ) / A 730 − 750 , where A 730 − 750 is the average absorbance between 730 nm and 750 nm, and finally averaging the normalized spectra for each strain across the biological replicates. To compare the growth of the (improved, reconstructed) ΔnirA∷nasDE strain with that of WT PCC 7002 when grown on either nitrate- or ammonia-media, biological triplicates of each strain were first precultured in 50 mL of nitrate-media at 37 °C and 1% CO2. The precultures were subsequently transferred to 100 mL of both nitrate- and ammonia media at an OD730 of 0.05. Note that while the precultures did introduce a small amount of nitrate into the ammonia-media cultures, ammonia is the preferred nitrogen source and represses nitrate assimilation (Ohashi et al., 2011), so it is unlikely to have affected the growth curves. The OD730 of each culture was measured periodically for ∼55 h, until it became evident that the ammonia cultures had stopped growing (likely due to acidification of the ammonia-media, which tested ≤ pH 5.0 at the experiment endpoint)."
5,Measuring alcohol production,"2.4 Measuring alcohol production To determine the alcohol production capabilities of the ΔnirA∷nasDE and WT PCC 7002 strain backgrounds containing the kivD yqhD cimA leuBCD operon in their glpK locus, precultures of these strains in biological triplicate were started in 50 mL of nitrate-media at 30 °C and 1% CO2. The grown precultures were transferred to 100 mL of fresh nitrate-media at an OD730 of 0.05 along with 1 mM IPTG and appropriate antibiotics. Note that antibiotics were included to provide a measure of assurance against strain reversion and contamination, as done in similar studies (Miao et al., 2018; Shen and Liao, 2012), though they were not strictly necessary due to the strains being homozygous for the production cassettes. Because of the volatility of the produced alcohols, the production experiments were run using sealed cultures that were fed bicarbonate as a carbon source. The use of sealed cyanobacterial production cultures has been shown (Miao et al., 2017) to almost entirely eliminate the loss of isobutanol to evaporation both out of the flask and into the sealed headspace, which is assumed to also be the case for the other, similar alcohols analyzed in this study. At the beginning of the cultures and then twice daily for the duration of the experiment, 1 mL of culture was removed from each flask for OD730 and alcohol measurements and 1 mL of nitrate-media containing 1 M sodium bicarbonate, 1 mM IPTG, and antibiotics was added back to the culture. The pH of the cultures was also adjusted at each sampling back to ∼7.0 using hydrochloric acid to prevent the media from becoming too alkaline due to bicarbonate consumption. The alcohol production experiment using MAD Media was conducted identically as in standard nitrate-media, except that the preculture and culture media contained 96 mM NaNO3, 2.4 mM KH2PO4, and 0.25 mM FeCl3, in place of the standard amounts of those nutrients. To measure alcohol titers, the 1 mL culture samples were centrifuged at 15,000×g for 5 min and the supernatant was removed, filtered, and stored at −80 °C. The concentrations of isobutanol, 1-butanol, 1-propanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, and 3-methyl-1-butanol in the thawed supernatant were measured, along with 1-pentanol as an internal standard, using a GC-FID (Shimadzu GC-2010), equipped with a Restek Stabilwax-DA column (60 m, 0.53 mm ID) and an autoinjector. The GC protocol was as follows: Helium carrier gas was used with an inlet pressure of 11.1 psi. The injector and detector were held at 250 °C. 1 μL of sample was injected with a split ratio of 5:1. The column flow rate was 8.46 mL/min. The oven temperature was initially held at 60 °C for 1 min, then raised to 130 °C at 10 °C/min, and finally raised to 210 °C at 60 °C/min and held there for 3 min before completion of the analysis."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Model-guided strain design,"3.1 Model-guided strain design In order to identify metabolic strategies to increase the production of next-generation biofuel compounds in PCC 7002, the strain design algorithm OptKnock (Burgard et al., 2003) was used in conjunction with the genome-scale metabolic model iSyp708 (Vu et al., 2013) to identify gene and/or reaction knockouts that were predicted to maximize the production of various alcohols (1-butanol, 1-propanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, and 3-methyl-1-butanol) via an engineered branched-chain alcohol pathway (Fig. 1 ). This pathway relies on the action of an α-keto-acid decarboxylase and an alcohol dehydrogenase to convert various α-keto-acid intermediates in branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis into the corresponding alcohols (Atsumi et al., 2008). These alcohols were selected as target compounds for this analysis because they showed potential in a previous computational study assessing PCC 7002's capacity for chemical production (Vu et al., 2013). Additionally, PCC 7002 has been identified as a particularly promising cyanobacterial strain for the production of these short chain alcohols due to its relatively high tolerance to their toxicity, with PCC 7002 tolerating up to 10-times the external concentration of isobutanol before displaying significant growth reduction, compared to Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (Ruffing and Trahan, 2014). The OptKnock algorithm successfully identified reaction knockout sets that were predicted to enhance production of the various alcohols in PCC 7002 (Table S1). In this initial OptKnock solution, it was identified that by knocking out the glutamate synthase (GOGAT) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) reactions, the model is forced to assimilate ammonia via an NADH-dependent alanine dehydrogenase. When this is combined with other knockouts that reduce the model network's ability to regenerate NADH, a strict coupling is created between the now-essential NADH-dependent ammonia assimilation and one or more NADH-producing steps in the branched-chain alcohol biosynthesis pathways catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (IPMDH) (Fig. 2 A). Because this coupling is based on NADH that is not directly derived from the photosystems, the identified strategy holds for both CO2-limited conditions (as assumed in the model) as well as photon-limited conditions. The identified metabolic strategy here appears to contradict another alcohol-coupling approach recently found in silico in cyanobacteria (Testa et al., 2019), wherein knockouts that increased—instead of decreased—levels of intracellular NADH were predicted to improve production of ethanol. However, the consistency of the two approaches can be understood by considering the redox-cofactor specificities of the modeled biosynthesis pathways. In the Testa et al. study, ethanol production was achieved via an NADH-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase, which enabled the coupling between NADH overproduction and alcohol overproduction. In the present work, all reducing steps in the modeled alcohol production pathways are NADPH-dependent, with several oxidative decarboxylation steps generating NADH, which can be coupled to NADH-consumption elsewhere in the metabolic network. Even if a strict growth-coupling were not achieved, it seems likely that the creation of an NADH-sink in PCC 7002 could improve upstream fluxes toward the various branched-chain alcohols by facilitating regeneration of the required NAD+ cofactor. However, while interesting, this knockout-coupling strategy was initially deemed problematic because the GOGAT knockout was likely to prove highly deleterious or lethal due to its central role in cyanobacterial nitrogen regulation (Muro-Pastor and Florencio, 2003; Okuhara et al., 1999). However, we hypothesized that if a large NADH-demand could be engineered into the cells in a different manner (i.e. without disrupting ammonia assimilation), then this general metabolic engineering strategy could still be viable. One potential way to create such an NADH-demand would be to replace one or more native PCC 7002 oxidoreductase enzymes that catalyze a reaction consuming large amounts of reducing-cofactor(s) other than NADH (e.g. NADPH or ferredoxin) with a heterologous enzyme that catalyzes the same reaction but is specific for utilizing NADH. To identify candidate enzymes in PCC 7002 for this type of replacement, FBA was used to predict a WT flux distribution, and those reactions that consumed the largest amounts of reducing power in the network were identified (Table 1 ). While the largest consumer of reducing power was, expectedly, the photosynthetic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase due to its role in carbon fixation, this reaction is not a candidate for the proposed replacement-and-coupling strategy since it is itself the upstream source of the reducing power generated by PDH and IPMDH in the branched-chain amino acid pathways. The second and third largest potential consumers of reducing power in the model were found to be the two reactions of the nitrate assimilation pathway, nitrite reductase (NiR) and nitrate reductase (NaR), respectively. This result is supported by the literature wherein nitrate assimilation has been shown to consume up to 30% of the total reducing power in phototrophically growing cyanobacteria (Ohashi et al., 2011). This two-step pathway, composed of the NaR and NiR reactions, carries out the reduction of nitrate to ammonia and is essential in PCC 7002 when grown with nitrate as the sole nitrogen source. Additionally, cyanobacterial NaR and NiR are specific for using ferredoxin as a reducing cofactor, whereas most heterotrophic bacteria use NADH or NADPH to carry out the same reactions (Moreno-Vivián et al., 1999). As such, replacing either or both of PCC 7002's nitrate assimilation enzymes with heterologous enzymes specific for NADH was identified as a promising approach to create a high NADH-demand within the strain that could be used to promote flux through the NADH-generating reactions in the branched-chain alcohol pathways (Fig. 2B). To test this idea in silico, the NaR and NiR reactions in iSyp708 were both modified to consume NADH instead of reduced-ferredoxin. OptKnock was then re-run to see if it would identify essentially the same coupling strategy as before, but this time taking advantage of the new NADH-consuming reactions. Indeed, the strain design algorithm did suggest the same set of knockouts as before (excluding GOGAT and GDH, which were not allowed). Additionally, the predicted maximum growth-coupled yields, i.e. the yields at the maximum predicted growth-rate, were substantially higher (roughly 7- to 9-fold, depending on the alcohol) owing to the large NADH demand required by the modified nitrate assimilation reactions (Fig. 2C). It was therefore determined that the core genetic modification required for this strategy, in addition to introducing the required alcohol biosynthesis pathway, would be the replacement of PCC 7002's NaR and/or NiR with heterologous NADH-dependent enzymes. While the deletion of additional genes that enable NADH generation in PCC 7002, as identified in the OptKnock solutions, may further improve the overall strategy by strengthening the desired metabolic coupling, many of the identified knockout reactions are likely under-constrained in the model and may not actually play a significant role in NADH production. For example, the transhydrogenase, PntABC, in PCC 7002 was identified as an essential knockout because in the model it freely allows redox-balancing of the NADH and NADPH pools, however there is some evidence that in cyanobacteria this enzyme displays minimal activity under continuous-light autotrophic conditions (Broddrick et al., 2016; Cooley and Vermaas, 2001). As such, this study will primarily focus on assessing the effect of NADH-dependent nitrate assimilation on the production of branched-chain alcohols."
8,Functional replacement of PCC 7002's native nitrite reductase,"3.2 Functional replacement of PCC 7002's native nitrite reductase The replacement of one or both enzymes in PCC 7002's nitrate assimilation pathway is the key aspect of the desired metabolic coupling strategy. Due to the potential difficulty of simultaneously replacing both enzymes in the pathway, and because NiR consumes three-times as much reducing power as NaR, PCC 7002's NiR (nirA) was selected as the initial target for testing this replacement strategy. Cyanobacterial NiR are monomeric enzymes that catalyze the six-electron reduction of nitrite to ammonia in the cytosol and primarily serve an assimilatory role (Flores et al., 2005). As mentioned previously, cyanobacterial NiR is known to specifically utilize reduced ferredoxin as an electron donor. In other bacteria, NiR enzymes can exist in several different forms that utilize various reducing cofactors (Moreno-Vivián et al., 1999). Importantly for this work, assimilatory NiR in heterotrophic bacteria appear to often be specific for NADH. While relatively few bacterial assimilatory NiRs have been thoroughly characterized to verify their cofactor preference (Luque-Almagro et al., 2011), the enzyme NasDE from Bacillus subtilis has been studied in the literature and was shown to be specific for using NADH as its reducing cofactor (Nakano et al., 1998). Additionally, NasDE was shown to be expressed and active during aerobic growth on nitrate in B. subtilis, indicating that the enzyme is likely oxygen-tolerant, which is a necessary characteristic for functionally-expressed enzymes in cyanobacteria when growing under phototrophic (i.e. oxygenic) conditions. For these reasons, nasDE from B. subtilis was selected for the initial attempt at replacing nirA in PCC 7002. To replace PCC 7002's NiR with the heterologous enzyme from B. subtilis, first the native gene nirA was deleted from PCC 7002 by introducing a selection/counter-selection cassette using homologous recombination. Deletion of nirA rendered the strain incapable of growing on media that contained nitrate as the sole nitrogen source, as has been shown previously (Sakamoto et al., 2008). The PCC 7002 ΔnirA strain was subsequently transformed with a homologous recombination construct containing the B. subtilis nasDE genes targeted at the nirA locus to generate an in situ replacement of the native gene (Fig. S1). The transformation was plated on nitrate-containing media (Media A+) (Ludwig and Bryant, 2011) and small colonies were observed after ∼10 days of growth. These colonies were confirmed by PCR to contain the nasDE genes and also to be homozygous at the targeted locus. Isolates of this new ΔnirA∷nasDE strain were then transferred to liquid Media A+ to grow up. After observing only very slight growth (data not shown), the liquid culture was serially passaged to attempt to select for faster growing mutants. After 4 passages, the culture visually displayed improved growth and was re-plated on Media A+. Isolates of subsequent colonies had the ΔnirA∷nasDE locus sequenced to identify if mutations in the nasD or nasE genes were a possible cause of the improved growth. While there were no mutations in either genes' coding sequences, the passaged strain did contain a point mutation 9 base pairs upstream of the nasD start codon on the chromosome (Fig. S2) which we hypothesized could have caused the improved growth. To determine if this base-change was in fact the cause of the improved growth, the nasDE locus was cloned from the passaged strain and used to reconstruct a “clean” ΔnirA∷nasDE strain containing the identified point mutation upstream of the operon. The growth of this reconstructed strain on nitrate media was then compared to that of the passaged and original ΔnirA∷nasDE strains. We observed that the reconstructed ΔnirA∷nasDE strain had approximately the same growth rate as the passaged ΔnirA∷nasDE strain (Fig. 3 A), indicating that the single non-coding base-change was in fact the primary cause of the growth improvement. Additionally, the absorbance spectra of these strains growing on nitrate-media (Fig. 3B) reveal that the reconstructed and passaged ΔnirA∷nasDE strains do not show decay of their phycobilisomes (as measured by the phycocyanin-peak around 635 nm), indicating that the heterologous NiR construct containing the 5′-UTR mutation enables sufficient nitrate assimilation to avoid a nitrogen-starvation state in the cells (Clark et al., 2018). To further characterize its growth, the reconstructed ΔnirA∷nasDE strain with the evolved nasDE operon (hereafter referred to simply as the “ΔnirA∷nasDE strain”) was grown alongside WT PCC 7002 on Media A containing either nitrate or ammonia as the nitrogen source. Growth curves for the mutant and WT strains show that the ΔnirA∷nasDE strain only displays reduced growth when using nitrate as a nitrogen source (doubling time 5.9 h vs 3.6 h in WT) and otherwise grows at the same rate as WT on ammonia media (doubling time 3.3 h) (Fig. 4 ). This indicates that the growth reduction in the mutant strain is caused by the heterologous NiR activity, possibly due to the smaller intracellular supply of reducing power available for the NADH-dependent NiR relative to the WT enzyme's ferredoxin cofactor (Cooley and Vermaas, 2001; Tamoi et al., 2005). Taken together, the above results demonstrate that the native NirA enzyme in PCC 7002 can be functionally replaced by the NiR from B. subtilis, facilitating NADH-dependent growth on nitrate as the sole nitrogen source."
9,Alcohol production is improved in the engineered strain background,"3.3 Alcohol production is improved in the engineered strain background To determine if the presence of the NADH-dependent NiR does improve the production of one or more of the branched-chain alcohols, the branched-alcohol pathway was engineered into both WT PCC 7002 and the ΔnirA∷nasDE strain. Specifically, we introduced genes encoding an α-keto-acid decarboxylase (kivD from Lactococcus lactis), an alcohol dehydrogenase (yqhD from Escherichia coli), and an engineered citramalate pathway (feedback-resistant mutant of cimA - cimAΔ2 (Atsumi and Liao, 2008) from Methanococcus jannaschii and leuBCD from E. coli). The α-keto-acid decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase carry out the two essential steps of converting α-keto-acids present in branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis into the corresponding alcohols. The engineered citramalate pathway was included to promote flux through the NADH-producing reaction catalyzed by LeuB (IPMD) in order to take advantage of the NADH-coupling strategy. This production pathway was previously engineered in another model cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7924 (Shen and Liao, 2012). In the previous study, chromosomal overexpression of two separate operons (kivD yqhD and cimA leuBCD) led to the production of 2-methyl-1-butanol (2MB), with lesser amounts of isobutanol, n-butanol, and n-propanol. Plasmids containing these two operons with homology-arms targeting neutral-sites in S. elongatus were obtained courtesy of the Liao Lab. Because PCC 7002 does not contain the same neutral sites as S. elongatus, the operons were combined into a single operon with homology to PCC 7002's chromosome to facilitate ease of transformation and segregation (Fig. 5 A). The complete alcohol biosynthesis operon was integrated into PCC 7002's glpK locus in both WT and ΔnirA∷nasDE strain backgrounds under control of the IPTG-inducible cLac143 promoter (Markley et al., 2014). Cultures of these production strains grown photosynthetically, produced both isobutanol and 2MB as major products, (Fig. 5B/C), unlike the previous report in S. elongatus where 2MB was the primary product of this pathway. The other potential products of the pathway, 1-butanol, 1-propanol, and 3-methyl-1-butanol, were all produced in negligible amounts (<10 mg/L). Interestingly, the WT strain produced more isobutanol while the ΔnirA∷nasDE strain produced more 2MB. Specifically, the ΔnirA∷nasDE background produced ∼58 mg/L of 2MB and ∼53 mg/L of isobutanol over the course of four days, while the WT background produced ∼28 mg/L of 2MB and ∼37 mg/L of isobutanol. Thus, we observed an approximately 71% increase in total alcohol titers resulting from the presence of the NADH-dependent nitrite reductase, and specifically a 107% increase in 2 MB and a 43% increase in isobutanol. Additionally, the ΔnirA∷nasDE background displayed apparent maximum production rates of 33.8 mg/L/day 2MB and 34.8 mg/L/day isobutanol, compared to 16.3 mg/L/day 2MB and 24.4 mg/L/day isobutanol in the WT background. Notably, alcohol production in our engineered strains appears to undergo a sudden down shift after 2–3 days of growth, roughly corresponding to an OD730 of 3.7 for both strains. Recently Comer et al. (Comer et al., 2020) showed that PCC 7002 reaches a maximum accumulation of “non-glycogen biomass” around this same timeframe in continuous-light laboratory batch culture in standard Media A+, and thereafter all increases in biomass are due to accumulated glycogen. In that study, the shift to a glycogen-accumulating phenotype corresponded to a shift from nutrient-replete to nitrogen-limited conditions in the growth media, with the duration of non-glycogen biomass production being proportional to the amount of nitrogen in the culture. In a similar vein, several recent works have shown that increasing the amounts of certain nutrients, particularly nitrate, phosphate, and iron, in Media A+ leads to overall increases in growth of PCC 7002 and related cyanobacteria (Clark et al., 2018; Włodarczyk et al., 2020). Based on the above information, we hypothesized that one or more nutrient limitations in the standard media for PCC 7002 was causing alcohol production to drop off prematurely in the engineered strains. To test this hypothesis, alcohol production cultures were re-run using a slightly modified version of the “MAD Media” from Włodarczyk et al. (Włodarczyk et al., 2020). Our version of MAD Media contained 2.4 mM phosphate instead of the published 1.2 mM, as the increased phosphate yielded a slight growth benefit specifically for PCC 7002 in the aforementioned study. Results from this production run (Fig. 6 ) show that indeed, alcohol production is improved in the presence of the additional nutrients and does not undergo the sudden drop off seen in the previous production experiment. Furthermore, we again observe that alcohol production in the ΔnirA∷nasDE strain background is improved relative to production in a WT background, with the ΔnirA∷nasDE production strain accumulating ∼171 mg/L of 2MB and ∼181 mg/L of isobutanol and the WT background accumulating ∼85 mg/L and ∼131 mg/L of the same alcohols, respectively. The maximum productivities of the two production strains stayed approximately the same as in the production run in regular Media A+, indicating the increased titers in the MAD media were primarily caused by the extension of the productive period in batch growth. The titers observed in this study using the high-nutrient media are improved in the ΔnirA∷nasDE background compared to both the WT PCC 7002 background strain as well as to several similar cyanobacterial alcohol production strains reported in the literature. In the aforementioned report on Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 expressing the same production pathways as in this study (Shen and Liao, 2012), alcohol titers of ∼120 mg/L 2MB and ∼30 mg/L isobutanol were reported over the same time frame as used in the current study (7 days), with final titers of 177 mg/L 2MB and 50 mg/L isobutanol reported after 12 days. It is unclear why there is a substantially different product distribution of 2MB and isobutanol between S. elongatus and PCC 7002 in these two studies, though it may reflect fundamental metabolic differences between the species or may simply be the result of the different expression constructs used. In the same study, a strain of S. elongatus expressing only kivD and yqhD without the engineered citramalate pathway produced ∼145 mg/L isobutanol, ∼22 mg/L 3-methyl-1-butanol (3MB), and no 2MB over 7 days, with final titers of 297 mg/L isobutanol and 33 mg/L 3MB after 12 days. Likewise, in a strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 expressing an α-keto acid decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase (kivD and adhA from L. lactis), ∼85 mg/L isobutanol was reported as produced after 9 days under similar culture conditions as used in the present study (Varman et al., 2013). The ΔnirA∷nasDE production strain reported here yielded higher titers and apparent productivities of both 2MB and isobutanol than the above strains over course of the reported production run."
10,Conclusions,"In the study, we have used a genome-scale metabolic model of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 to identify a metabolic engineering approach predicted to improve the production of certain alcohols synthesized via the non-fermentative, branched-alcohol pathway. This approach relies on generating a large NADH-demand within the cell by altering the cofactor-usage of one or more reactions in the native nitrate assimilation pathway to be specific for NADH. We have tested this approach by experimentally constructing a ΔnirA∷nasDE PCC 7002 strain that utilizes a heterologous, NADH-dependent nitrite reductase from B. subtilis in place of the native, ferredoxin-dependent enzyme. When an engineered branched-chain alcohol pathway was expressed in this modified strain background, production of the alcohols 2-methyl-1-butanol and isobutanol was significantly improved relative to that in a WT strain background. To the best of our knowledge, the implementation of an increased, non-product-associated NADH-demand within a strain is an entirely novel metabolic engineering strategy for improving the production of these alcohols in cyanobacteria. We further demonstrated that the productive period for these alcohols in batch culture was extended by the use of higher amounts of nitrogen, phosphate, and iron than are in standard PCC 7002 media. Looking forward, several questions arise with regard to improving the potential of these production strains. Notably, because the production pathway used in this work was ported from a different cyanobacteria and was not explicitly optimized in PCC 7002, it will be useful to determine optimal gene expression levels to maximize the degree of metabolic-coupling and/or productivities. Additionally, metabolic-coupling as implemented here has the potential to provide genetic stabilization of production strains (Rugbjerg and Olsson, 2020) and further investigations are needed to determine whether this is the case for the strains based on the ΔnirA∷nasDE background. Overall, the ΔnirA∷nasDE strain serves as a platform for further engineering of PCC 7002 production strains that can yield improved titers of this class of alcohols and potentially other products that are downstream of NADH-generating reactions. The metabolic approach identified here expands the repertoire of available techniques for engineering the unique metabolism of cyanobacteria, helping to bring cyanobacterial production strains closer to being a viable technology."
