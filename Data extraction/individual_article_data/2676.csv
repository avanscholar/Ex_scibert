0,Introduction,"The alternative energy source such as bioethanol, biomethane and biohydrogen has increased in significantly due to the rapid depletion of fossil fuels (Ginkel and Sung, 2011). Recently, a clean energy carrier with great potential like biohydrogen is generated as a sustainable biofuels with high energy (122 kJ/g) and has ability to reproduce from various agro-industrial wastes (Nagarajan et al., 2019). Dark fermentation is a process in which anaerobic bacteria are capable of converting complex and organic substrate into H2, CO2 and volatile fatty acid (VFAs) under the absence of light with a very simple reactor technology (Cheng et al., 2011; Urbaniec and Bakker, 2015). Cost-effective for economic hydrogen production can be achieved by using agriculture crops and their by-products (Sinha, 2011; Mishra et al., 2019). Cassava pulp is abundant agro-industrial waste in Thailand. Based on the carbohydrate-rich components, starch and non-starch (cellulose and hemicellulose) contained in cassava pulp, can be used as a favorable carbon source for hydrogen production under dark fermentation. Utilization of cassava pulp to generate hydrogen energy is environmental friendly and making hydrogen gas more accessible and cheaper (Kapdan and Kargi, 2006). However, hydrogen production from the recalcitrance of native lignocellulose by anaerobic digestion process require 3 important step, (1) pretreatment follow by (2) hydrolysis and (3) biogas fermentation. Until recently, only a few research groups have been reported to be able to use one-step hydrogen production from cassava pulp (Li and Zhu, 2011). Therefore, for economic hydrogen production, the development of a one-step hydrogen production process by using a group of effective bacteria that combines biological pretreatment, hydrolysis and fermentation in one condition is interesting. Dark fermentation under anaerobic and thermophilic conditions produces higher H2 yield and more favorable for biological H2 production, compared to the mesophilic condition (Pawar and Niel, 2013). Moreover, the advantages of enriched consortia will be able to challenge more different substrates and adapt to higher variabilities of the fermentation process, thus improving conversion proficiencies (Brenner et al., 2008) and breeding selection bacteria will survive together under hydrolysis and fermentation by making balance of each bacteria (Cao et al., 2014). This study focused on explore a novel bacteria consortium for one-step hydrogen production from cassava pulp, the influence of isolation and enrichment of bacteria community during dark hydrogen fermentation process. Meanwhile, bacteria population profile during hydrolysis and hydrogen production stages were investigated to understand the relationship of bacteria community for hydrogen production using cassava pulp. We found that the thermophilic anaerobic consortium BK16 isolated from the mangroves area has the high ability to covert cassava pulp into hydrogen in one-step. Moreover, extracellular polysaccharide-degrading enzymes and optimum conditions for efficiency hydrogen production and elucidation of microbial communities through biological processes were also studied."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Raw material,"2.1 Raw material Cassava pulp obtained from the starch industry (Nakornphanom province, Thailand) after the process of cassava starch production. It was ground by using an electric grinding machine (High-speed herbs grinder) (smaller than 40 mesh), washing to remove the impurities and then oven dried at 60 °C until constant weight. Starch, Beechwood xylan, cellulose (Sigmacell), xylose and glucose were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co., USA. All standard of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, butanol, and ethanol are from Sigma-Aldrich Co., USA."
3,Inoculum and medium preparation,"2.2 Inoculum and medium preparation Soil and sediments samples were collected from various locations in Krabi province (Kr) and mangroves areas around Bangkutiean province (BK), Bangkok Thailand. Basal medium was used in this study. The basal medium (g/L) containing 0.45 K2HPO4; 0.45 KH2PO4; 0.9 NaCl; 0.9 (NH)4 SO4; 5.0 Yeast exact powder; 0.12 CaCl2.2H2O; 0.18 MgSO4.7H2O; 50 μl of 1% resazurin; 4 Na2CO3; 0.5 cysteine hydrochloride, and 3% cassava pulp as a sole carbon source. Subsequently, it was adjusted to pH 7.2, then flushed with CO2 gas to obtain anaerobic condition (after that call BM7-CO2). The medium was autoclaved at 121 °C for 15 min and stored at room temperature until continue to use."
4,Screening and isolation of thermophilic anaerobic bacteria consortia,"2.3 Screening and isolation of thermophilic anaerobic bacteria consortia Thermophilic anaerobic bacterial consortia from soil and sediments samples using BM7-CO2 medium were enriched with 3% (w/v) cassava pulp. In brief, samples were weighed 0.5 g into the anaerobic Hungate tubes containing 7.0 ml of BM7-CO2 medium. Afterward, those tubes were flushed with CO2 gas, and one-piece of filter paper (1 × 10 cm2) was added as an indicator, then incubated at 60 °C for three days. The effective degrading cassava pulp, filter paper and high gas production of each candidate was chosen. These candidates are expected to be able to consume cassava and produce hydrogen gas. Then, positive candidates were subcultured in the fresh medium containg of cassava pulp for several times until cassava pulp degradation and gas production were stable."
5,Microbial communities analysis,"2.4 Microbial communities analysis Total genomic DNA was extracted according to the constructer’s protocol using the QIAamp DNA stool mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Determination of DNA quality by a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop ND-1000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The bacterial 16S rRNA gene contains nine hypervariable regions (16SV4/16SV3/16SV3–V4/16SV4–V5, 18S V4/18S V9, ITS1/ITS2, Arc V4) were amplified used specific primer and carried out with Phusion® High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs). The PCR products with bright main strip between 400 and 450bp were purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN) and sequence generated with NEBNext® UltraTM DNA Library Prep Kit read on an Illumina platform."
6,Biohydrogen fermentation,"2.5 Biohydrogen fermentation The serum bottles (100 mL) of bath experiment was set up with a 50% working volume and supplement with 3% (w/v) of cassava pulp in BM7-CO2 medium. These serum bottles were incubated under thermophilic anaerobic condition at 60 °C for three days, the hydrogen production was measured by gas chromatography (GC; model GC-2014, Shimadzu, Japan) with DB-wax column (150 °C) and a frame ionic detector (FID, 230 °C), while the total gas production was measured by water displacement method. The hydrogen production equation was calculated as follows: Where H is the hydrogen produced volume (mL); P is the amount of hydrogen production (mL) and V is the total volume of biogas (mL). Cumulative hydrogen is the sum of hydrogen from all days of incubation. H = ( P 100 ) × V Effect of pH on hydrogen production was studied using BM7-CO2 medium supplemented with 3% (w/v) of cassava pulp. The initial pH of the media were adjusted to 5.0–8.0 while H2 production was analysed day-to-day using Gas chromatography. In addition, to study the effect of CP on hydrogen production, BM7-CO2 media were supplemented with various CP concentration (1–15% w/v) at initial pH 7.0. Batch fermentation were incubated under thermophilic anaerobic conditions at 60 °C for three days, the hydrogen production and metabolite products (VFAs and solvents) were investigated."
7,Analytical methods,"2.6 Analytical methods The biogas composition was determined by Gas chromatography using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD, 120 °C) and column oven at 40 °C with Argon as the carrier gas at the flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The standards include hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide. The soluble metabolites products, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and solvents were analysed using GC with a DB-wax column and a frame ionic detector. The standards include acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, butanol, and ethanol. The pH in the solution was measured by pH meter. The capable of cassava pulp degradation was measured by determining the remaining dry weight after culturing with the candidate consortia. Polysaccharide and lignin contents were analyzed following the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) protocol (Sluiter et al., 2008). The enzymatic activity was assayed by analyzing the amount of increasing reducing sugar using Sommogyi-Nelson method at 60 °C for 10 min using starch, xylan and cellulose as a substrate for determination of amylase, xylanase and cellulase, respectively. One unit of the enzyme activity (U) was defined as the amount of enzyme that liberated 1μmole of reducing sugars per minute. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bardfoard protein assay kit (Biorad, USA) with BSA as the standard. Degradation efficiency was calculated from the difference in dry weight before and after hydrogen production process."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Screening and isolation of the effective consortia for hydrogen production,"3.1 Screening and isolation of the effective consortia for hydrogen production All 100 soil and sediment samples were used for screening. The consortia were isolated through high gas production and the degradations of cassava pulp and filter paper. After enrichment culture more than 15 times, only three adaptive consortia (Kr11, BK16 and Kr29) showed theirs effective degradation with high biogas production. When growth on cassava pulp for 3 days, the consortium BK16 produced the highest of total gas (298 mL) and total hydrogen production (138.57 mL of hydrogen in 100 ml) at 60 °C, followed by Kr11 (83.56 mL of hydrogen in 100 ml) and Kr29 (56.43 mL of hydrogen in 100 ml) (Table 1 ). Report as a hydrogen yield and hydrogen production rate of 34.64 mL H2/g substrate and 46.19 mL/day from BK16."
10,Cassava pulp degradation and hydrogen production,"3.2 Cassava pulp degradation and hydrogen production As shown in Fig. 1 , after three days cultivation, the three candidate consortia degraded cassava pulp in the range of 19 to 43%. Fig. 2 shows that not only starch but cellulose and hemicellulose were also degraded by the three candidate consortia. Polysaccharide-degrading enzyme activities were determined, all candidate consortia could produce amylase, cellulase and xylanase from cassava pulp. However, BK16 is the best candidate to degrade cassava pulp. After cultivation the consortia BK16 for three days, amylase, cellulase and xylanase were detected at 68 U/mg, 70U/mg and 98 U/mg, respectively as well as produced high hydrogen (34.64 mL H2/g substrate). According to the above the results, the consortium BK16 was selected as the best candidate to produce H2 from cassava pulp. During enzymatic hydrolysis of the polymerized complex cassava pulp by BK16, mostly insoluble organic compounds, like starch, cellulose and hemicellulose are decomposed into monosaccharides and subsequently utilized by hydrogen producing bacteria to produced H2. The BK16 members involved polysaccharide degrading bacteria and hydrogen producers. After three day, starch was degraded and remaing only 8% (Table 2 ). Generally, starch is covered by hemicellulose and cellulose, causing to the lack of enzyme accessibility. However, after degrading hemicellulose (mainly xylan) and cellulose by xylanase and cellulase, starch surface were improved to degrade by amylolytic enzyme. In this consortium, xylanse, cellulase and amylase were detected and work together to synergy to improve lignocellulose saccharification. In dark fermentation processes, hydrogen is basically produced from simple sugars (Phowan and Danvrutai, 2014), which were the hydrolysis products from the actions of polysaccharide-degrading enzymes toward starch, xylan and cellulose contained in cassava pulp. Enzyme and hydrogen production profile of the consortia KB16 grown on cassava pulp was studied. During the first 2 days, amylase, cellulase and xylanase were produced rapidly, resulting in increased the large amount of fermentable sugars. After that, the rate of enzyme productions decreased. While during the 2 days, production of hydrogen continues to increase rapidly, which corresponds to the amount of sugar produced. After that the production of hydrogen were quite constant (Fig. 3 )."
11,Microbial community analysis,"3.3 Microbial community analysis To understand bacteria population in the consortia at hydrolysis stage (day-1) and hydrogen producing stage (day-3), the bacterial communication change in the system were investigation. The high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene contains nine hypervariable regions (V1–V9) was analyzed for identification of the microbial diversity. The result indicated that bacteria population profile in first day cultivation, the majority strain were Ruminiclostridium_1 (42% of relative abundant), Clostridium sensu stricto 1 (24% of relative abundant), Thermoanaerobacbacterial (Family III) (24% of relative abundant), Tepidimicrobium (6% of relative abundant) and a few of Clostridium sensu stricto 7 (Clostridium thermopalmarium) (4% of relative abundant). At day-3, most of cassava pulp were hydrolysed, resulting in booming of hydrogen producing bacteria. As shown in Fig. 4 , the BK16 consortia consisted of the main genus related to Clostridium sensu stricto 7 (Clostridium thermopalmarium) with relative abundant 62% and closed to genus Clostridium sensu stricto 1 (Clostridium isatidis) which represented approximately 26%. It also related to genus Thermoanaerobacterium (6.67%) and genus Fonticella (Fonticella tunisiensis) (5.06%). Almost 70% of H2 production was investigated using strict anaerobes genus Clostridium. Recently, Clostridium sensu stricto 1 has been reported to utilized various carbon sources such as glucose, xylose, sucrose, hemicellulose, cellulose and starch for efficient hydrogen production under dark fermentation (Yang et al., 2019). Dominant species distribution at day-3 incubation are visualized in Table 3 . The result showed that a cellulolytic/hydrogen-producing bacterium, Ruminiclostridium, and a non-cellulolytic/hydrogen-producing bacterium, Clostridium thermopalmarium, were the main co-exist in BK16. At 3 days cultivation Ruminiclostridium_1 and Tepidimicrobium were not observed, probably due to pH dropped to lower than 5.0 (data not shown). At the same time, the abundance of dominant hydrogen producing genus Clostridium sensu stricto 7 increased from 4 to 62% relative abundance and could detect one more stain Fonticella tunisiensis (5.06%), which may be contributed to more efficient hydrogen fermentation. The dominant microorganisms belonging to Clostridium and Termoanaerobacterium, in class Clostridia, were a typical anaerobic fermentative bacteria that have ability to convert monosaccharides into biohydrogen and acetate/butyrate during fermentation under thermophilic conditions (Lee et al., 2010; O-Thong et al., 2011). During growth, most of genus Clostridium can produce polysaccharide-degrading enzyme. Thus, sugar produced by these microbes can enhance the production of hydrogen (Harut et al., 2002). Also, Thermoanarobacterium sp. is able to achieve both degradation of cellulose (Cao et al., 2014) and possible ferment pentose to ethanol and hydrogen under anaerobic thermophilic conditions (Wongwilaiwalin et al., 2010). From the application point of view, the consortia have more benefits to produce H2 than pure culture, including more adaptive to environmental stress, variation pH and temperature, and consortia can offer flexibility to any contamination (Wang et al., 2016). Furthermore, enrichment consortia is preferable over pure cultures as a result of more simple monitoring and operation, and the possibility to apply with a wide range of feedstocks, as several different microbial community are often needed altogether to degrade complex substrates (Wang and Wan, 2009). The experimental results indicated that the microbial communities of BK16 showed a great difference among various cultivation time."
12,Effect of pH on hydrogen production,"3.4 Effect of pH on hydrogen production A significant difficulty for the commercialization of biohydrogen production is the core production cost and many requiring steps. Improving the process by effective bacterial community BK16 could make it more economically feasible. Fig. 5 shows that operating initial pH value between pH 5.0–8.0 have a significant influence on several aspects of hydrogen production. Because the culture medium containing cassava pulp consists of microelements, initial soluble sugars which can be utilized for bacterial growth and hydrogen productions, cumulative hydrogen production at first day during cultivation of BK16 could be observed from cassava pulp between pH 5.0–8.0. pH 7.0 is the best hydrogen production from cassava pulp by BK16 with 230.12 mL of hydrogen production, which 2-, 3- and 2.7-folds better than that of pH 5.0, 6.0 and pH 8.0, respectively. The reason may be at pH 7.0, the dominated bacteria for H2 production in BK16 consortia grew well and therefore produced high amounts of polysaccharide-degrading enzymes. Moreover, most bacterial polysaccharide-degrading enzymes work well at neutral pH (Pason et al., 2006). Acidic and alkaline conditions are influences the hydrogen-producing bacteria activities and could affect the metabolism pathways as well as the activity of hydrogenase. Therefore, it is important to maintain the pH level at an optimum rang to enhance hydrogen production, avoiding the inhibition and promoting hydrogen fermentation in the production process. Change of pH will not only induce metabolic shifts in microbes but also affect the cooperation and competition among various bacteria in a mixed culture, resulting in a difference in metabolite profiles (Yang and Wang, 2019)."
13,Effect of cassava pulp concentration on hydrogen production,"3.5 Effect of cassava pulp concentration on hydrogen production The concentration of carbon source is a significant factor that effects the fermentative H2 production and activities of H2 producing bacteria. To outcome in work, BK16 consortia was grown at various concentrations of cassava pulp (1–15% cassava pulp) under anaerobic condition at 60 °C and the H2 production was investigated. The result showed that the maximum H2 production was found at 228 mL or 2,280 mL of H2/L when 10% cassava pulp (100 mL culture) was used (Fig. 6 ). When concentration of cassava pulp less than 10% (w/v), the hydrogen production reduced may be because it is not enough nutrient and carbon source for bacteria utilization. However, at 15% (w/v) cassava pulp, the hydrogen production reduced may because by the less mass transfer and bacteria penetration. Therefore, 10% (w/v) cassava pulp is recommended for effective hydrogen production by BK16. Optimization condition for hydrogen production at initial pH 7.0 with 10% cassava pulp BK16 produced 225 ml H2/g cassava pulp. Most of hydrogen productions utilize starch or hydrolysate cassava starch as carbon sources such as thermophilic mixed cultures, namely PK produced hydrogen yields of 249.3 mL H2/g starch from raw cassava starch (O-Thong et al., 2011). The raw starch is quite pure substrate, easy to degrade and ferment by microbes. However, there are few reports to describe hydrogen production from raw cassava pulp. Therefore, BK16 is a promising candidate for one-step hydrogen production from raw cassava pulp. The profile of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohol from the different concentration of cassava pulp by BK16 consortia at thermophilic condition (60 °C) are play in Table 4 . The products of volatiles fatty acid from 10% cassava pulp show major VFAs was butyric acid follow by acetic acid and propionic acid, without butanol. Accumulation of electrons by compounds such as ethanol, butyrate and propionate is the bacterial response to an increase in hydrogen concentration in the solution. Thus, the profile of acetic acid, ethanol and butyric acid involved to the metabolic part way of microorganism and high profile of hydrogen production. Commonly, the pathway of fermentative H2 production is monitored using the acetic and butyric ratio (Wong et al., 2014) that corresponded with higher ratios of butyric acid/acetic acid and butyric acid/propionic acid (Luo et al., 2010). Yang and Wang (2019) reported that butyric acid possibility produced by all species in the Clostridium cluster I (Clostridium sensu stricto) which dominant in BK16. Thus, the profiles of acetic acid, ethanol and butyric acid involved to the metabolic pathways of microbs in BK16 and the profile of high hydrogen production in one-step were investigated. The profiles of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohol from various concentrations of cassava pulp by BK16 consortia at thermophilic condition (60 °C) are shown in Table 4. The major volatile fatty acid products from 10% cassava pulp was butyric acid, followed by acetic acid and propionic acid, but lack of butanol. Cumulation of electrons by some compounds such as ethanol, butyrate and propionate is the bacterial response to increasing the hydrogen concentration in the culture supernatant (Yang et al., 2019). Here, dark fermentation is the main method to produce sustainable hydrogen due to it can use various type of carbon sources, especially carbohydrate-rich waste like cassava pulp, making it a feasible option for large scale hydrogen production."
14,Conclusions,"This study, the BK16 consortium successfully produced biohydrogen in one-step using untreated cassava pulp by dark fermentation under thermophilic anaerobic conditions. Selection of the enrich inoculum with appropriated bacteria community is a key strategy for a successful biohydrogen production process. Biohydrogen production is greatly affected by the species type of bacteria contained in the BK16 consortium. The main genus in the BK16 (more than 80% of the microbial population) related to the community of cassava pulp degrading (Clostridium thermopalmarium) and hydrogen-producing (Clostridium isatidis) strains. Moreover, the BK16 is capable of producing polysaccharide-degrading enzymes such as amylase, cellulase and xylanase, which are important for cassava pulp saccharification as intermediate substrates to produce acetic and butyric as the main VFAs for further convert to H2 by hydrogen-producing strains. The maximum condition for the BK16 to produce H2 from cassava pulp was initial pH 7.0 and 10% (w/v) cassava pulp, in which 230.12 mL of hydrogen (23 ml H2/g substrate) was produced. This research has identified strengthening the ability to produce current anaerobic thermophilic bacteria consortium BK16 for the future development of biohydrogen production from cassava pulp in the future."
