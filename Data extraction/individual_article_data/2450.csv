0,Introduction,"Energy band engineered materials such as modified TiO2 photocatalysts display promising properties for environmental applications including hydrogen production via water splitting [1–5]. These materials appear to contribute to hydrogen formation. This occurs via the modification of both the energy band gap and the formation of a Schottky barrier which retards the charge recombination at the TiO2 particle outer surface. This phenomenon appears to promote the efficient separation of holes and electron charges under UV-light irradiation. Hence, photocatalytic activity can be enhanced using TiO2 dopants, promoting H radical formation and hydrogen production [6–10]. In 1972, Fujishima and Honda were the first to report photoassisted water electrolysis using the rutile form of TiO2 as the photoanode of a photoelectric cell [11]. The development of novel semiconductors (photocatalysts) has increased in recent years. New semiconductors such as TiO2 combined with either tantalate compounds [1,12] or noble metals [2,13–17] under UV or visible light have gained importance for hydrogen production. These photocatalysts have been studied in different photocell configurations under different conditions. It has been noticed that in the absence of both a sacrificial agent and a noble metal, the e−/h+ recombination on the semiconductor surfaces can occurs quickly. Therefore, the efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production is very low. To achieve higher efficiencies however, different “sacrificial agents” have been proposed such as alcohols, carbohydrates, hydrocarbons and organic pollutants. These materials, so-called “hole scavengers” can react irreversibly with the holes (h+) on the semiconductor outer surfaces. Nevertheless, to be able to use them in practice, electron donors must be cheap and easily accessible [2,3]. Furthermore, sacrificial agents should not be derived from fossil fuels. Sacrificial agents should be a renewable resource or derived from them such as ethanol [18–20]. This will make hydrogen production a sustainable process. Otherwise, the main environmental advantage of producing hydrogen via water splitting and solar energy will be loss or partially lost. In this respect, it is envisioned that a good and low cost “sacrificial agent” can be ethanol in low concentrations (1–2vol.%) [3]. Low ethanol concentrations can be obtained from the natural fermentation of glucose, fructose, sucrose and even agricultural waste [21–23]. During photocatalytic oxidation, the photocatalyst absorbs UV light, which excites electrons from the valence band into the conduction band. The resulting electron (e−)/hole (h+) pairs can then migrate to the surface of the semiconductor and initiate redox reactions with adsorbed organics and protons [1,2,4,5,13,18,24,25]. Regarding solar light, near-UV light in the 340–388nm wavelength range corresponds to 4–5% of the complete solar irradiation spectrum [18,24,25]. Thus, the application of the DP25 photocatalyst with solar light is limited. Nevertheless, platinum can retard both charge recombination (e−/h+) and serve as a temporary electron reservoir. The accumulated electrons on platinum can eventually react with water or protons forming H radicals [6,7,19,21]. As a result, the electron band gap (Ebg) and the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen generation can be improved [8,9,20]. Experiments in hydrogen formation via water splitting were performed in this study using a Photo CREC Water II Reactor with a specially designed H2 collector tank. This study also took advantage of a modified semiconductor material (Pt/TiO2) with a conveniently reduced band gap and 2vol.% ethanol (EtOH) as a h+ scavenger. Experiments with near-UV light and Pt modified TiO2 were performed under the special condition of having “all” irradiated photons with photon energies superseding the band gap of the semiconductor. This approach also allows establishing quantum yields for hydrogen production using the entire irradiation beam spectrum from the near UV lamp."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst,"2.1 Preparation of Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst DP25 Titanium dioxide (TiO2) from Evonik Degussa Co. was used as semiconductor “support” to prepare the modified photocatalyst of the present study [14,26,27]. Platinum on DP25 photocatalysts was prepared using incipient wetness impregnation achieving 0.0616, 0.103 and 0.23 and 1wt% loadings [28,51]. DP25 was dried at 140°C for 6h before impregnation to desorb water and some other species potentially present on the TiO2 particles. A 99.9wt% H2PtCl6·xH2O reagent from Sigma–Aldrich Co. was dissolved in distillate water to produce the different impregnating Pt solution concentrations. The first Pt impregnation step was carried out at vacuum conditions with continuous mixing of the TiO2 support. A 4ml of the precursor solution was employed. This solution was prepared with different precursor concentrations as required by the desired platinum loading to be used. A 2ml aliquot of this precursor solution was added to 5g of TiO2 in a drop-by-drop manner. Once the liquid addition was complete, the impregnating solution and the TiO2 were left in contact with each other for 10min. The wet photocatalyst was heated up to 140°C during 30min using a 4.6°C/min temperature ramp. Furthermore, the photocatalyst was left for another 2h at 140°C. This allowed water evaporation from the TiO2 support leaving the H2PtCl6 phase on the photocatalyst outer surface. The dried photocatalyst cake was crushed in a mortar until the resulting particles were fine enough, and reached an acceptable size. Following this, a second impregnation step was carried out using a 2ml of the remaining precursor solution and contacting it with 5g of the TiO2 already impregnated one time. The twice impregnated photocatalyst was now dried at 160°C for 3h following a 5.3°C/min temperature ramp. The resulting photocatalyst cake was crushed and later grinded in a mortar. The finely grinded particles which were obtained displayed a particle size distribution which is shown later in Fig. 6. Furthermore, the resulting particles were heated up to 450°C during 1h using a 7.5°C/min temperature ramp and were left in the oven at 450°C for another 3h. The 450°C temperature was selected to ensure that chlorine was fully removed [14,26–28]. Finally, the photocatalyst was placed in a flow reactor unit under a 1cm3/s of Ar/H2 (g) (90/10%, Praxair) reducing mixture. Reduction steps involved the following: (a) a 6.6°C/min temperature increase during 1h and (b) once 400°C reached, this temperature was kept here for another 3h. In summary, and using the preparation procedure described in this section, platinum (M0) particles were formed on the TiO2 particle outer surfaces."
3,Photocatalyst characterization,"2.2 Photocatalyst characterization Prepared photocatalysts were characterized using: (a) specific surface area, (b) chemisorption, (c) X-ray diffraction, (d) particle size distribution, (e) X-ray fluorescence, (f) UV–VIS–NIR spectra and (g) images and elemental mapping. The specific surface areas of all prepared photocatalysts were determined using a BET surface area analyzer (Micrometrics, ASAP 2010) and using nitrogen adsorption. A photocatalyst sample was dried and degassed in a sample tube at 300°C for at least 3h before adsorption. The results were assessed by using the Autosorb ASAP 2010 software, Version 5.02. Moreover, the active metallic particle size (crystallite size) and metal dispersion were calculated by pulse chemisorption analysis (Micrometrics, AutoChem II 2920V 4.00). The crystalline phases of the photocatalysts were investigated using a X-ray diffractometer RIGAKU Ultima IV (Multi-Purpose Diffractometer). This instrument features a 3-kW X-ray beam with a high-precision 2θ wide-angle horizontal goniometer as well as “cross beam optics”. The particle size distribution of the prepared photocatalyst was measured by using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano-Series. The elemental composition analysis of the photocatalyst was established by X-ray Fluorescence (Philips PW-1480 Wavelength Dispersive Spectrometer) and quantified by utilizing the Iniquant Software. The band gap of the photocatalyst was determined by employing an UV–VIS–NIR Spectrophotometer (UV-3600 Shimadzu). Images and elemental mapping of the photocatalyst were performed using SEM/EDX (LEO/Zeiss 1540XB FIB/SEM). The ion beam column was utilized for in situ sectioning of samples which were imaged by SEM. The system was fitted with an Oxford Instruments X-ray system allowing for elemental mapping and analysis of the selected sample milled sections. In this way, samples could be monitored in real time at high resolution with an electron column (selective etching can be achieved with sub-100nm resolution)."
4,Lamp characterization,"2.3 Lamp characterization The lamp testing unit (LTU) developed by Serrano and de Lasa [52] was used to calibrate the BLB lamp. The LTU Unit consists of a UV-opaque chamber, a lamp holder and a spectrometric sensor holder rail. Irradiation spectrum measurements can be performed with the sensor cell facing the lamp. The sensor is displaced along a rail which is located at a fixed distance from the lamp axis [29]."
5,Photocatalytic reactor,"2.4 Photocatalytic reactor A novel Photo CREC Water II Reactor was used in the present study (Fig. 1 ). This modified Photo CREC Water II Reactor operates as a “well mixed” batch unit. This unit includes major changes required for hydrogen production, such as a self-driven mixing stirrer and a hydrogen storage tank. The modified Photo CREC Water II Reactor for hydrogen production also includes two concentric tubes to provide a radial and axial symmetric irradiation field. The first tube is a transparent inner cylinder of Pyrex glass, that was used due to the fact it only absorbs 5% of the emitted near UV-Light (It has a good near UV-Light transmission properties) and has a low cost. A Black Light Blue Lamp of 15W is placed inside this glass tube and has an emission range of 340–410nm. The second and outer tube is made out of UV opaque polyethylene to minimize radiation reflection. Moreover, this outer reactor tube facilitates radiometric, spectro-radiometric measurements and performance of macroscopic energy balances for energy efficiency calculations. In addition, it provides a free-flowing photocatalyst suspension in the concentric annular channel. Fig. 1 reports a schematic diagram of Photo CREC Water II Reactor and accessories. This figure shows the overall unit configuration: a sealed stirred tank chamber connected in series with a tubular photocatalytic reactor. The Photo CREC Water II Reactor includes the additional following components: (i) a BLB lamp, (ii) a Pyrex glass tube, (iii) a UV-opaque polyethylene cylinder, (iv) fused-silica windows, (v) a centrifugal pump, (vi) a H2 storing/mixing tank, (vii) a gas sampling port, (vii) a purging gas injector and (viii) a draining gas valve. Dimensions of the main components of Photo CREC Water II as adapted for hydrogen production are given in Table 1 . Regarding the sealed well mixed tank, it was designed and equipped to accomplish the following: (i) provide jet driven mixing for TiO2–water slurry free of sealing issues and hydrogen losses, (ii) take aliquot samples (gas and liquid) allowing measurements of organic scavengers and hydrogen, (iii) add the photocatalyst (Pt/TiO2), (iv) store H2, (v) feed inert gases (N2 or Ar) as needed, (vi) measure the pH and (vii) monitor the temperature. A centrifugal pump circulates the fluid throughout the system and is used to modify the flow rate. Prior to the experiments, the photocatalyst was sonicated for a 10min period to ensure good particle distribution in the slurry solution before being added to the water/ethanol solution in the storage tank."
6,Analytical techniques,"2.5 Analytical techniques The GC, a unit manufactured by Shimadzu GC-2010 equipped with a Grace Hayesep D packed column 100/120 mesh (9.1mx2mmx2μm nominal) was used to separate H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4O from O2 and N2 (air). Furthermore, this GC has TCD and FID detectors as required for the quantification of various species. The Ar carrier gas has high purity (Praxair 99.999%). The use of argon as a carrier allows increasing the sensitivity of the detector toward H2. The GC was interfaced with a desktop that enables the analysis of the injected samples. The samples of 0.8ml were taken manually (Hamilton CO. gastight valve-syringe of 1ml) from the PCW-II mixing/storing H2 tank at set times. They were then injected in a GC port for analysis. The calibration of the GC TCD detectors was made using several mixtures of known gas concentrations. The UFLC-Shimadzu HPLC with a Supelcogel C-610H column of 30cmx7.8mm ID was employed to separate both the carboxylic acids and alcohols in water. In addition, a UV (LC-20AB) and a RID-10A detectors were employed for quantitative chemical species analysis at various irradiation times. This was done with the intent of tracking the formation of organic acids and ethanol degradation during hydrogen production."
7,Results and discussions,
8,BLB irradiation lamp characterization,"3.1 BLB irradiation lamp characterization The performance of artificially powered photocatalytic reactors is strongly influenced by the lamp irradiation spectra. Furthermore, it is advisable that the lamp to be used be warmed up for a period of 5min to stabilize the lamp's emissions, before lamp utilization [24]. A StellarNet EPP2000C-25 LT16 Spectrometer was used to determine the energy spectrum of the BLB lamp through the fused silica windows in the Photo CREC Water II Reactor. Fig. 2 displays a typical near-UV irradiation BLB characteristic spectrum emitted in the range of 340–410nm. This is a BLB polychromatic lamp which emits photons having a wavelength which changes to a relatively narrow wavelength. Once the irradiation is defined as in Fig. 2, the average emitted photon energy (E av) can be calculated using the following relationship [30]: (1) E av = ∫ λ min λ max I ( λ ) E ( λ ) d λ ∫ λ min λ max I ( λ ) d ( λ ) In the case of this study and as shown in Fig. 2, all photons had a wavelength with a corresponding energy large enough to supersede the band gap of the Pt modified photocatalyst. Thus, all emitted photons were able in principle to contribute to the photocatalytic transformation. As a result, considering E(λ)= hc/λ and the numerical integration of Eq. (1), the average photon energy is E av =324.1kJ/photon. In this respect, radiation distribution along the reactor axis in the Photo CREC Reactor was also measured using a lamp testing unit (LTU). Fig. 3 reports the irradiation axial fluxes for: (1) a new lamp: a symmetrical irradiation distribution case showing a stable irradiative flux along the reactor axis and (2) an old lamp (250h of use): an asymmetric irradiation distribution, displaying axial changes of irradiation. This last case represents lamp performance decay observed after more than 100h of operation. Lamps displaying “old lamp” irradiation distribution were excluded from the experimental runs of hydrogen production."
9,Photocatalyst characterization,"3.2 Photocatalyst characterization 3.2.1 BET surface area The specific surface areas of all the prepared photocatalysts were determined employing a BET surface area analyzer (Micrometrics, ASAP 2010). This analyzer uses nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms. Fig. 4 reports the BET specific surface areas for fresh DP25 (as received) and DP25 after thermal treatment at 450°C: cases A and B, respectively. These cases show specific surface areas of 50.8 and 53.3m2/g. In addition, Fig. 4 reports the specific surface areas for Pt loaded TiO2 with 0.06, 0.1, 0.2 and 1wt% of platinum. Resulting specific surface areas (cases C, D, E and F) are 53.0, 53.2, 53.9 and 53.9m2/g, respectively. It is thus, possible to notice that Pt addition on DP25 slightly increases the specific surface area. Therefore, Pt loading of DP25 does not influence the specific surface significantly, and this parameter is not affected either by platinum loading or/and calcination. 3.2.2 Chemisorption Table 2 reports the results for different photocatalysts using pulse chemisorption. The photocatalysts of the present study were assessed using chemisorption measuring the percent of metal dispersion and the active platinum crystallite diameter at different Pt loadings on DP25. It was observed that at high platinum loadings, the metal dispersion on DP25 was reduced from 42.21 to 22.76%. This means that the platinum modified photocatalysts of this study provide good metal dispersion on DP25. Moreover, platinum crystallite sizes were increased with platinum loading from 2.68 to 4.98nm. This is consistent with results reported later in this study: XRD suggests that platinum crystallites are smaller than 5nm with no XRD characteristic 2θ peaks for Pt in the XRD diffractogram. It is expected that higher platinum loadings on DP25 may improve charge distribution in the water-particle suspension, reducing TiO2 particle agglomeration, as it is shown later in Section 3.2.5. However, higher platinum loadings if uncontrolled may favor e−/h+ recombination. Thus, one should expect an optimum value for platinum loadings on DP25 in terms of their influence for hydrogen production. 3.2.3 X-ray fluorescence (XRF) Table 3 reports XRF analysis of Pt loadings. It can be noticed that the platinum on DP25 using incipient wetness impregnation was successful. The adopted impregnation method indeed provides the expected metal loadings on DP25. XRF determined loadings were 0.0616, 0.103, 0.23 and 1.08wt%. These loadings were in close agreement with the ones anticipated. 3.2.4 X-ray diffraction (XRD) The crystalline phases of the photocatalysts were investigated by an X-ray diffractometer RIGAKU Ultima IV a Multi-Purpose Diffractometer. (This instrument features a 3-kW X-ray beam with a high-precision θ–θ wide-angle horizontal goniometer and “cross beam optics”.) Fig. 5 reports the crystalline diffractogram patterns for DP25 (bare TiO2) and for four other photocatalysts modified with Pt. XRD diffractograms were overlapped for comparison. One can note that the characteristic 2θ diffraction anatase peaks at 25°, 37°, 48°, 54° and 55° were consistently observed. The smaller XRD peaks at 27° and 69° were also present, given the rutile content in DP25. There were no other XRD peaks as one could expect for platinum at 40° and 46° of 2θ values [43,44]. These findings are consistent with the low platinum loadings on DP25 TiO2. It is also confirmed that incipient wetness impregnation yields a highly dispersed metallic phase with smaller than 5nm platinum crystallites, with these small crystallites passing undetected to XRD. (2) x = 1 + 0.8 I A I R − 1 with x being the weight fraction of rutile in the TiO2 powder, I A and I R being the XRD intensities for anatase and the rutile peaks, respectively. Thus, with Eq. (2), it was possible to establish that DP25 contains 87% of anatase and 13% of rutile and that both phases were present in the commercial DP25 (TiO2) and Pt modified TiO2. 3.2.5 Particle size distribution (PSD) Fig. 6 reports the particle size distribution (PSD) of DP25 (TiO2) and the platinum-loaded TiO2. It can be observed from the PSD chart, that Degussa P25 displays a significant fraction of particles in the 1000–3000nm range even after sonication. However, when Degussa P25 was impregnated with Pt at 0.06, 0.1, 0.2 and 1wt% loadings, there was a noticeable PSD displacement of the peaks toward the smaller particle sizes in the 50–100nm range. Thus, it appears that Pt addition helps to reduce particle agglomeration, favoring better distribution of charges and as a result, interparticle surface forces [49,50]. While this effect may be in principle favorable in terms of irradiation absorption, it may also provide an enhanced electron (e−)/hole (h+) recombination reducing the effectiveness of hydrogen production. 3.2.6 Scan electron microscope and EDX Images and elemental mapping of the photocatalyst were performed using SEM/EDX (LEO/Zeiss 154XB FIB/SEM). Fig. 7 shows SEM images of (a) DP25 (TiO2) and (b) TiO2 loaded with platinum. Individual Pt crystallites were difficult to be observe using SEM [28]. It can be seen, however, that there is particle agglomeration in DP25 strongly influenced by interparticle surface forces. Image (a) reports tighter agglomerates in bare DP25 while image (b) shows looser particle agglomerates for platinum doped DP25 particles. Thus, SEM confirms PSD observations where Pt addition reduces interparticle surface forces [49]. 3.2.7 Diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectroscopy (DRS) Platinum addition enhances irradiation absorption in the visible range. One can certainly see that there is a color change accompanying platinum addition treated by incipient wetness impregnation followed by calcination and reduction. The photocatalyst turns from light yellow to gray [11,32,34]. Fig. 8 represents schematically the effect of platinum loading on DP25 band gap energy. It can be hypothesized that platinum doping on DP25 introduces additional electron energy levels (Fermi level) into the conduction band [33,35,37,39]. This ends by yielding a reduction of the energy band gap level, as shown in the ensuing discussion from 3.20 to 2.73eV. Fig. 9 reports the diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectra for non-doped and platinum doped DP25. This UV–vis spectra provides both an indication of the UV–vis light semiconductor absorption, as well as a method for evaluating the band gap energy [36,40,41]. This method is based on extrapolating the spectrum steepest line of each UV–vis spectra until the wavelength axis is intersected (x-axis in Fig. 9). This intersection wavelength defines the band gap energy for the semiconductor under consideration as E bg = hc/λ int. Using this method, one can notice that platinum addition progressively reduces UV–vis light absorption. In addition, the wavelength resulting from the extrapolation with the steepest line gives a λ int of 388nm or 3.2eV for DP25 and 455nm or 2.73eV for platinum modified DP25 with 1wt% of Pt. Thus, one can conclude that photon absorption is related to the amount of Pt0 present on the photocatalyst surface [36]. Furthermore, platinum addition provides semiconductors with a wider irradiation absorption spectrum, absorbing photons with lower energy [47,49]. It is expected on this basis, that platinum addition on DP25 will provide an enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production [11,27,31,38,49]. 3.2.8 Local volumetric rate of energy absorption (LVREA) LVREA can be determined experimentally through the irradiation intensity macroscopic balance inside the photocatalytic reactor. In this respect, chemical actinometry provides insufficient assessment of LVREA given that it assumes that photons not reaching the outer reactor wall are absorbed. Instead, a macroscopic radiation balance allows the calculation of the precise radiation absorbed by the solid photocatalyst [29,44,45]. Using this approach one can establish the optimal photocatalyst concentration allowing all forward radiation contained in the slurry photocatalyst phase in the Photo CREC units [45]. 3.2.8.1 Macroscopic radiation energy balance (MREB) A macroscopic energy balance can be applied to a control volume as described in Fig. 10 a). This control volume is established to include the semiconductor slurry phase [29,44]. It allows the evaluation of the rate of photon absorption as follows: (3) P a = P i − P bs − P t where P a is the rate of absorbed photons by the photocatalyst, P i is the rate of photons reaching the reactor inner surface, P bs is the rate of backscattered photons exiting the system, and P t is the rate of transmitted photons (all in einsteins/s). The various terms in Eq. (3) are calculated as follows: (a) P i can be evaluated from the difference between the rate of photons emitted by the lamp (P o), and the rate of photons absorbed or back reflected by the inner Pyrex glass wall (P a-wall) (4) P i = P o − P a-wall (b) P o or the rate of photons emitted by the lamp can be calculated given the lamp BLB emission spectrum and radiometric measurements (refer to Fig. 2). (5) P o = ∫ λ 1 λ 2 ∫ 0 L ∫ 0 2 π q ( θ , z , λ ) r d θ d z d λ (c) P a-wall can be computed from transmission measurements through the inner Pyrex tube. Fig. 2 also displays the very modest change of irradiation spectrum radiation that evolves through the inner Pyrex glass. The little energy band gap (λ Ebg) changes introduced by the Pyrex glass are reported as well (Table 4 ). (d) P bs can be approximated by the difference between P i and the rate of photons transmitted when the photocatalyst concentration approaches zero. (6) P bs = P i − P | c → 0 + (e) P t can be calculated as the addition of the transmitted non-scattered radiation (P ns) and the forward scattering radiation (P fs). (7) P t = P ns − P fsc Regarding P ns, it can be estimated by using the black collimators for the transmitted non-scattered radiation, and P fs can also be evaluated using polished-aluminum tube collimators. These two radiation terms account for the combined transmitted non-scattered radiation and forward-scattering radiation [29,45]. As a result and using this approach, one can establish in Fig. 10a and b that LVREA increases with photocatalyst concentration with a LVREA optimum achieved at 0.15g for DP25 or modified DP25 per liter. At these conditions, one can secure 95% of the irradiated absorption. One can notice that this optimum value, as reported in Fig. 10a and b, is independent of both the pH and Pt loading."
10,Hydrogen production,"3.3 Hydrogen production 3.3.1 Photocatalytic reaction mechanism Fig. 11 reports a schematic description of hydrogen production in the modified photo CREC unit. Fig. 11 provides representations at three different scales: macro-scale, meso-scale (Zoom 1) and micro-scale (Zoom 2). This schematic representation emphasizes the event that could occur at the level of a doped TiO2 particle (meso-scale) and on a surface region where platinum crystallite is laid out (micro-scale). Irradiation of this zone, as described in Zoom 2, leads to charge separation (e− and h+ sites). This elementary step is the preamble to H formation. Thus, in the Photo CREC Water II Reactor, with suspended and impregnated-TiO2 particles and a water solution containing an organic scavenger such as ethanol, the following mechanistic steps can be considered (refer to Fig. 12 and manuscript Appendix A): (i) a photon reaches the semiconductor surface with an energy greater than the band gap, (ii) an electron (e−) and a hole (h+) separate, given the electron energy content to allow charges to move from the valence band to the conduction band, (iii) platinum nanoparticles deposited on the surface of DP25 (TiO2) act as electron reservoirs, capturing the moving electrons on the DP25 (TiO2) surface [6,7,13,19,21], (iv) stored electrons interact with adsorbed protons, formed from dissociated water yielding H radicals, (v) hydrogen radicals couple themselves forming gas phase hydrogen (H2(g)). On the other hand, the produced h+ holes react with OH− groups forming OH radicals. These hydroxyl radicals (OH) are highly reactive species, able to convert ethanol (C2H5OH) or other organic species (refer to Fig. 12 and Appendix A). Regarding the ethanol reaction with OH species, ethanol can form acetaldehyde (C2H4O) in the first reaction step of the network. This reaction step can be followed by further reaction of acetaldehyde with another OH yielding acetic acid (CH3COOH). Moreover, formed acetic acid can be further converted under the prevalent conditions of the Photo CREC Water II into carbon monoxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and ethane (C2H6). In competition with the above described reaction steps, there is a possible e− and h+ site recombination. This electron and hole recombination does not accomplish any useful photocatalytic conversion, and as a consequence contributes to the overall photocatalytic process inefficiency. Thus, e−/h+ recombination has to be limited as much as possible. 3.3.2 The energy efficiency factors in photocatalytic processes Energy efficiency criteria in a photochemical process such as Quantum Yields (QY) are critical parameters in establishing irradiation utilization [24]. 3.3.2.1 Quantum yield for hydrogen production (ϕ) The quantum yield (QY) for hydrogen production is a number ratio resulting from equating the rate of H molecules produced over the number of photons absorbed in the impregnated TiO2 [24,46]: (8) % ϕ = [ d N i / d t ] P a x 100 Fig. 13 describes a “series–parallel” model already postulated for the photoconversion of organic pollutants in water in a Photo CREC Water II Reactor [24]. This reaction network is adapted in the present study for hydrogen production having ethanol as the “organic scavenger”. This mechanism is expected given the likely variability of photon density as in a Photo CREC Water II Reactor. One can see that as reported in Table 5 and as described in detail in Appendices A and B, one can define the “theoretical quantum yields” based on the photon stoichiometric requirements for H radical production as follows: (9) ϕ theor = moles of H moles of photons For instance, in the case of complete mineralization of ethanol, this “theoretical quantum yield” is 0.8. However, considering the possible influence of various reaction steps at any time during the irradiation process with these steps involving both the scavenger and the intermediates, a reasonable average estimate for this theoretical QY is 0.78 or 78%. It should be emphasized that this theoretical QY value can be used as a reference only, and represents the QY that one can expect assuming that there is no electron–hole recombination. 3.3.3 Effect of the pH on hydrogen production and on Quantum Yields (ϕ) Both hydrogen and photo energy efficiencies (% ϕ ) were determined at NTP normal conditions (ambient temperature and close to atmospheric pressure) for different pHs [3] and different Pt loadings [28,31,32,34,47]. Each experiment was developed as follows: (i) near UV lamp off: 30min period with argon circulated continuously to remove any remaining oxygen from air and until ethanol adsorption equilibrium on doped TiO2 was reached; (2) near UV lamp on: 5h period where water with a suspended photocatalyst was recalculated continuously under irradiation. During both lamp off and lamp on, irradiation periods samples were taken periodically and analyzed in an HPLC and GC. This process allows one to establish the influence of Pt loading on the doped TiO2 and the effect of operating parameters (e.g. pH) on quantum yields. 3.3.3.1 Effect of alkaline pH A 2M NaOH solution was prepared and 2ml of this solution were added to 6L water/2vol.% ethanol solution. This solution was placed in the Photo CREC Water II mixing tank. The resulting pH before the experiment was approximately 10, and remained essentially unchanged during the complete experimental run. Fig. 14 displays the cumulative hydrogen generation at various irradiation times and at various platinum loadings for a pH of 10. It can be observed that at the alkaline conditions of pH=10, the 1wt% loading provides the best hydrogen generation performance of the four photocatalysts considered. All these photocatalysts, as described in Fig. 14, display a number of common features in terms of hydrogen production as follows: (i) the rates of hydrogen production were consistently higher during the first 1.5h of the run and (ii) the rates of hydrogen production decreased consistently after the initial 1.5h run period. Thus, it appears that the platinum–TiO2 under alkaline pHs still allows hydrogen production under the high OH− and limited H+ concentrations, as one can expect from water equilibrium dissociation. However, it is also possible to observe that while the run is progressing, this limited availability of H+ becomes even more acute on the photocatalyst surface with this leading to a progressive reduction of hydrogen formation rates. Fig. 15 reports the Quantum Yields for a pH=10. QYs were determined using Eqs. (3) and (8), and the respective values of hydrogen formation rates. It is important to notice that the reported QYs are based on H generation rates, whereby it is observed that the two phases for QYs are as follows: (a) QYs increase reaching a maximum value in between 1 and 2h of irradiation and (b) QYs steadily decline during the remaining period of the run. Table 6 reports hydrogen reaction rates and Quantum Yields (ϕ) for three of the photocatalysts of this study using a Photo CREC Water II Reactor. One can see that all of the Pt impregnated Degussa P25 photocatalysts display a higher hydrogen production than the bare Degussa P25. Thus, it is shown that platinum addition on DP25 having ethanol as the organic scavenger allows hydrogen production with a maximum 280mol/h·gcat rate during the 1–2h irradiation period and a 5.7% quantum yield. 3.3.3.2 Effect of neutral pH Experiments were developed with the various photocatalysts with a pH of 7. The pH remained close to the original value during the entire 5.5h of the run. Fig. 16 shows the cumulative hydrogen formation. Hydrogen production was detected as soon as the near UV lamp was turned on with cumulative hydrogen formed increasingly during the whole run. It can be observed that at a pH=7, there is a consistent increase of hydrogen during the first 1.5h, with this increase being more modest for the remaining run period. This trend appears to be similar to the one observed at pH=10. Fig. 17 reports QYs for the various photocatalysts at pHs of 7. One can notice that similar QY trends as the ones observed at pH=10 are obtained. In fact, in all the studies, photocatalysts display a common trend: (a) a QY increase during the first 1.5h, and then (b) a QY reduction for the rest of the run. Table 7 reports hydrogen reaction rates and Quantum Yields (ϕ) in a Photo CREC Water II Reactor for four different photocatalysts at pH=7. It is proven that platinum impregnated DP25 in the presence of the ethanol scavenger allows hydrogen production. Furthermore, it is also noticed that the 1wt% Pt addition yields a maximum hydrogen formation rate of 226mol/h·gcat with a 4.6 QY. This QY is close to the best 5.7% of the QY achieved at alkaline conditions. 3.3.3.3 Effect of acid pH The influence of acid pH on hydrogen formation rate was studied using H2SO4 [2M]. 1ml of this sulfuric acid solution was added in the 6L tank containing a water/ethanol solution. Regarding the pH, it was observed that it remained close to 4 for the complete 5.5h of the experiment duration. Fig. 18 displays the cumulative hydrogen production for different Pt loadings on DP25. As soon as the lamp was turned on, hydrogen formation was observed. A common and distinctive trend for the cumulative hydrogen formation curves is that they were consistently linear. In this respect, the linear trend was a major difference vis-a-vis of results obtained with the samples having a pH of 7 and 10. In particular, one can also notice in Fig. 18 that 1wt% Pt loading led to the best hydrogen production under acidic conditions. Fig. 19 reports the QY for the pH of 4. It was observed that there were distinctive trends of QYs once the near UV lamp was on: (i) progressive increase of hydrogen formation rate and as a consequence of the QYs during the first half an hour of irradiation and (ii) steady hydrogen formation rate during 5.5h with a ethanol conversion of less than 15%. As a result QYs reach maximum values after 0.5h and remain at those levels for the rest of the run. As described in Figs. 18 and 19, four different samples of DP25 loaded with platinum were considered in the experimental runs at a pH of 4. The photocatalysts studied, all showed steady hydrogen formation rates after the first half an hour of irradiation, will all of them surpassing the QYs of the bare Degussa D25. Table 8 reports hydrogen formation rates and Quantum Yields (ϕ) in the Photo CREC Water II Reactor for the four different Pt modified photocatalysts at pH=4. It can be observed that a 383mol/h·gcat hydrogen formation rate is obtained in between 1 and 2h of irradiation with a corresponding 7.86% quantum yield. This value remains steady during the 5.5h of the run. As a consequence, we can see that at a pH=4, the gas phase achieved a significantly increased hydrogen content during the 5.5h experiment. Therefore, it appears that the high concentration of H+ ions in the acid aqueous solution favors water dissociation and formation of hydronium ions. Additionally, the protons adsorbed on the photocatalyst can easily interact with generated and stored electrons, promoting hydrogen formation [48]. It is interesting to notice that the rate of hydrogen formation under acid pH becomes a steady process: H+ ions from the solution can be quickly resupplied to the photocatalyst surface (see Appendix B). As a result, there is no decay in hydrogen formation rates under acidic conditions and the cumulative hydrogen formation continues to increase without noticeable decline. This is, in our view, a valuable finding which is in clear contrast with the results obtained in the case of alkaline and neutral pH solutions where H+ ion resupply appears to be limited. In addition, one should note that the 7.8% QYs using Pt impregnated DP25 in a Photo CREC Water II under acidic conditions, are still valuable. This is the case in spite of being smaller than the expected theoretical 78% QY for hydrogen production (refer to Section 3.3.2.1). This QY which is lower than the theoretical value can be justified given H formation via photocatalysis using organic scavengers likely requires a 2 photon consecutive process [54]."
11,Conclusions,"(a) It is shown that an upgraded Photo CREC Water II Reactor can be used advantageously for storing and producing hydrogen for water splitting. The irradiative axial flux distribution and the irradiation spectrum for the BLB UV lamp were considered in this reactor using a lamp calibration unit and a spectrometer radiometer. (b) It is proven that TiO2 loaded with Pt using incipient wetness reduces particle agglomeration and presumably favors a better distribution of e−/h+, limiting charge recombinations, which is a favorable condition for water splitting. Furthermore, platinum addition reduces the band gap of DP25 (TiO2) from 3.20eV to 2.73eV. (c) It is shown that by means of macroscopic radiation energy balances in the Photo CREC Water II Unit, the LVREA for the various photocatalysts of this study can be established. As a result, a best photocatalyst loading of 0.15g/L was considered. (d) It is demonstrated that DP25 loaded with Pt in the presence of a sacrificial agent such as ethanol, favors free oxygen formation of hydrogen via photocatalysis. (e) It is shown that hydrogen forms at different pHs. It is proven, however, that acidic conditions are the most suitable for yielding both steady hydrogen formation rates and best quantum yields."
