0,Introduction,"Citral (3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal) is a terpene present in lemon grass (65–85wt%) responsible for the citric aromas and flavors. It is a molecule with three sites susceptible to be hydrogenated: a carbonyl group (CO), a double bond (CC) conjugate to the carbonyl and an isolated double bond (CC). Products from the partial hydrogenation (geraniol–nerol and citronellal) are used in flavor, pharmaceutics and cosmetics industries [1]. In this way, the design and synthesis of heterogeneous catalysts to drive the citral hydrogenation by a specific route is an attractive task [2]. It is well known that the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group is thermodynamically less favourable than the CC double bond conjugate to the carbonyl present in citral. Several research groups have directed some efforts to develop catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of the carbonyl [2]. The product distribution during citral hydrogenation is affected by different factors such as type of metal, promoter addition, the physicochemical properties of the support and reaction conditions. In this sense, Cordier et al. [3] examined the effect of active metal, support, reaction conditions, solvent and the addition of promoters on the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols in the hydrogenation of α,β unsaturated aldehydes. Gallezot and Richard [4] produced a review on the chemioselective hydrogenation of α,β unsaturated aldehydes, pointing out the effect of different solid catalysts on the selectivity in hydrogenation. In the case of the metallic phase, it has been demonstrated that transition metals provide specific selectivities to unsaturated alcohols in selective hydrogenation reactions. Singh and Vannice [5] studied the hydrogenation of citral on several Group VIII metals supported on silice and showed the activity has the following trend: Pd>Pt>Ir>Os>Ru>Rh>Ni>Co> >Fe, with Os, Ru and Co producing unsaturated alcohols, nerol and geraniol, whereas Rh, Ni and Pd were selective to citronellal and isopulegol. On the other hand, the high electron density of the conjugate CC and the oxygen of the carbonyl group induces polarity to the citral molecule. This electronic condition affects the way the citral molecule interacts with the catalytic surface, being influenced by the acid–base nature of the catalyst surface. In this sense, materials with Lewis acid sites induce the adsorption of α,β unsaturated aldehydes through the carbonyl (CO), which allows the increase of selectivity towards unsaturated alcohols [4]. These Lewis sites can be produced by: (a) the modification of the hydrogenating metal with the addition of a second metal (Pt–M bimetalic catalysts, where M=Sn, Ge, Co) [3,6–9], (b) the use of reducible metal oxides [10–13] or the synthesis of mixed oxides as supports[14]. However, in the case of bimetallic catalysts it has been reported that the addition of electropositive promoters to the metallic active phase brings a decrease of the activity due to the decoration effect of the metallic particles [15–19]. Regarding the effect of basic species, Satagopan et al. [20] reported an increase in selectivity to unsaturated alcohols upon the addition of alkaline compounds to the reaction mixture. Such effect has been attributed to the formation of Lewis sites as result of the interaction of cationic species (Na+, K+, etc.) with the support [4,21]. In contrast, basic mixed oxides derived from hydrotalcites (LDH) of the type Mg2+/Al3+ and modified by Ni2+, Mg2+, Co2+ [22], and Rh/MgO [23] catalysts were evaluated in the citral hydrogenation. In both cases, the main product was citronellal. Based on this information, it is clear that upon the modification of the acidity or basicity of the catalytic support the interaction of a citral molecule with the catalytic surface would be affected due to its polarity. The nucleophilic zone of citral (CO) would be oriented towards Lewis acid sites appearing on the formation of SiOM species, so that the unsaturated alcohols nerol and geraniol would be obtained. On the other hand, on basic sites, the support would induce citral to adsorb and hydrogenate the conjugate CC bond allowing the formation of citronellal. In this work a study has been performed to evaluate the effect of acid–base properties of the support on the catalytic behavior of Pt catalysts in the hydrogenation of citral in liquid phase."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst synthesis,"2.1 Catalyst synthesis Acid supports pure SiO2; SiO2–TiO2 (95:5wt%) and SiO2–ZrO2 (90:10wt%) were synthesized by the sol–gel method. In order to obtain materials, the hydrolysis and condensation were performed using a two-stage process: acid (HNO3) and basic (NH4OH). The molar ratios used in the synthesis were those employed by Tamayo et al. [24]: solvent/alkoxide=30 for Si and Si–Ti, or 40 for Si–Zr; water/alkoxide=8; acid/alkoxide=0.2 and base/alkoxide=0.2. After drying at room temperature, the xerogels were calcined 4h at 773K under air flow. Supports were labeled as: SiO2–AB (synthesized as reference); SiO2–TiO2 and SiO2–ZrO2. In the case of basic materials, hydrotalcite (LDH) samples Mg3AlO were prepared by coprecipitation from an aqueous solution of magnesium and aluminum cations (solution A) and a highly basic carbonate solution (solution B). Solution A containing Mg(NO3)2·6H2O and Al(NO3)·9H2O dissolved in deionized water. Solution B was prepared by dissolving appropriate amounts of Na2CO3 and NaOH in deionized water, the concentration of Na2CO3 being equal to 1M. NaOH concentration was adjusted to obtain pH 10. The synthesis procedure was similar to that reported in the literature [25,26]. Precipitates were aged for 72h at pH 10 and 333K, the solids were filtered, washed with deionized water until pH 7 and calcined at 773K. Alcoholic solutions (H2PtCl6/C2H5OH) were used in the wet impregnation method to obtain Pt (1wt%) on the supports. After platinum impregnation all materials were calcined and reduced at 773K under H2 atmosphere just before used as catalysts. The synthesized (Pt/MgAl-c) was considered as a Lewis basic material. Part of the reduced Pt/MgAl-c was rehydrated by directly adding deionized water (100wt% with respect to the sample Pt/MgAl-c), and aged for 6h, in order to restore the LDH structure and obtain Brönsted basic sites, before being used as catalyst and named Pt/MgAl-r."
3,Materials characterization,"2.2 Materials characterization The BET specific surface areas were obtained with an Autosorb-1 Quantachrome equipment. The samples were pretreated in vacuum (<10−2 Pa) at 373K prior to N2 adsorption. The solids crystalline structure was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a Siemens D-500 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation with λ =1.5406Å. NH3 and CO2 thermodesorption tests were performed using an ISRI RIG-110 automatic reactor with thermal conductivity detector equipment. Samples (0.1g) were loaded into a quartz reactor and pretreated for 1h at 773K under helium atmosphere, then cooled at room temperature. Samples were saturated using pulses of Ammonia or CO2. After saturation, ammonia (or CO2) was replaced with helium, and the sample was heated to 773K at a rate of 10K min−1. To identify the acid type sites of the mixed oxides FTIR-Py thermodesorption experiments were carried out in an IR-PerkinElmer equipment for a wide wavelength of 2000–400cm−1. FTIR measurements were performed using self-supporting pressed discs (12mg/cm2 thickness). Samples were outgassed at 523K (10−6 Torr) for 1h. Pyridine was then adsorbed, and evacuated for 30min at room temperature. Spectra were taken every 100K temperature increase. The FTIR instrument was typically operated at a scan speed of 0.1cm−1 s−1 and a resolution of 2cm−1 collecting 20 scans per spectrum. High resolution images were obtained in a High Resolution Electron Microscopy-JEOL-JEM-2100 (resolution 0.19nm at 200kV accelerating voltage). Samples powder was deposited in a vial with ethanol; a drop of the solution was taken with a glass capillary and deposited in a copper carbon covered grid."
4,Catalytic activity,"2.3 Catalytic activity Catalytic tests were performed in a Parr reactor at 200psi of H2 at 373K and 1000rpm. A citral/isopropanol 0.1M solution (130mL) and 16wt% of catalysts (catalyst particle size=50μm) respect to citral were used. After reduction the catalyst was handled under nitrogen atmosphere and loaded to the reactor. Reaction samples were taken at regular periods and products were analyzed by an Agilent 6890N chromatograph (HP-5MS capillary column (30m×0.25mm×0.25μm)) coupled to an Agilent 5973 mass spectrometer with a selective mass detector. At the end of the reaction, after cooling, the reaction mixture was filtered; the catalyst was washed and recovered. The catalytic tests were done in a kinetic regime, without mass transfer resistances. Calculations following Weiz-Pratter and Mears criteria confirmed the absence of external or intraparticle mass transfer limitations."
5,Results and discussion,
6,X-ray diffraction,"3.1 X-ray diffraction Fig. 1 shows the diffraction spectra of all synthesized materials, prepared by sol–gel (SiO2–AB, SiO2–ZrO2 and SiO2–TiO2), calcined at 773K and the Mg3AlO calcined at 773K and rehydrated. The diffraction patterns of the silica-based materials present only a typically broad reflection peak at 22̊ that corresponds to a 3.9Å interplanar distance. All these materials are amorphous solids. On the other hand the temperature treatment of the LDH material (Mg3AlO) at 773K causes the hydrotalcite structure destruction and a mixed oxide of low crystallinity was obtained (Fig. 1D). It is important to remark that during these thermal events, structural transformations take place due to dehydration, dehydroxilation and decarboxylation processes. Once the calcined Mg3AlO is rehydrated, by the addition of deionized water, the hydrotalcite structure restoration takes place. This phenomenom occurs gradually, until complete restoration of the hydrotalcite-like structure (Fig. 1E) after 6h of aging. The XRD pattern of MgAl-r sample corresponds to the Mg3AlO hydrotalcite phase structure (JCPDS 22-700) with sharp and symmetric (003) reflections below 30 2Θ/̊, and asymmetric (006) reflections at higher 2Θ/̊ values. Specifically, the reflection peaks at 2Θ of 11̊, 23̊, 35̊, 39̊ and 47̊ attributed to the (003), (006), (012), and (015) crystal planes [27] provide a clear evidence for the formation of LDH structure. This result confirms the memory effect characteristic of the LDH materials."
7,Nitrogen physisorption,"3.2 Nitrogen physisorption Nitrogen adsorption isotherms obtained at 77K for all the materials prepared are shown in Fig. 2I, and the textural characteristics of the calcined catalysts are given in Table 1 . Silica-based materials present type IV isotherms, with a narrow hysteresis, corresponding to mesoporous solids. High surface areas were obtained for SiO2, and mixed oxides SiO2–ZrO2 and SiO2–TiO2. The possibility of obtaining surface areas of these magnitudes and mesoporous materials for the silicas is derived from the synthesis method employed as shown earlier [24]. In the case of Mg3AlO samples the isotherms show an H3 type hysteresis which is characteristic of parallel platelets structures [28]. The reconstruction of the hydrotalcite crystalline phase due to rehydration of the calcined material results in a diminution of the BET surface area and pore volume (see Table 1). All the materials are mesoporous with a narrow pore size distribution for the silica-based materials, being broader for the Mg3AlO samples, as shown in Fig. 2II. It is also important to note that surface areas for silica materials are 3–6 times higher than those of Mg3AlO samples, with pore diameters in similar values."
8,Electron microscopy (HRTEM-EDX),"3.3 Electron microscopy (HRTEM-EDX) High resolution transmission electron microscopy analyses were performed to observe the metal particle distribution and by EDX the metal loading and support composition (Si/Ti, Si/Zr and Mg/Al). Using Z-contrast images the platinum metal particles were observed and the particle diameter distribution was obtained. Fig. 3 shows the images of four samples, with Pt particles clearly evidenced, and the metal particle size distribution is displayed also. All particles were evaluated and classified using the equivalent circle diameter and the average particle size presented is determined as the mean diameter. In all catalysts the platinum sizes were small, being lower for the Mg3AlO samples with Pt average size of 2nm [29,30], whereas for the silica-based samples the average metal particle size is around 4–5nm, as shown in Table 1. These Pt particle sizes are in agreement with those reported by Singh and Vannice [31] for silica-supported platinum catalysts prepared by incipient wetness impregnation and hexachloroplatinic acid as precursor. It is noteworthy that the smaller particle sizes were obtained for the lower surface area materials. Since the solution used for the Pt impregnation was similar, the main difference lies on the different isoelectric points (IEP) of the supports. The isoelectric points for silica and silica-based mixed oxides are in the range 1–7 [32], the corresponding isoelectric point for Mg3AlO materials is around 10 [33]. Therefore the metal particle size differences observed are due to the different interactions of the precursor used for impregnation and the acid or basic properties of the supports. Table 1 shows the results of elemental analysis obtained by EDX. The Pt metal loading was close to the theoretical load (1%). In the case of the Si, Ti and Zr content the analyses demonstrate that the experimental values is very close to the theoretical one for SiO2–ZrO2 (90–10wt%) and SiO2–TiO2 (95–5wt%)."
9,Acid–base analyses: NH3 or CO2–TPD and FTIR-Py,"3.4 Acid–base analyses: NH3 or CO2–TPD and FTIR-Py NH3 or CO2 temperature-programmed desorption and Pyridine FTIR were used to identify and quantify the acid and basic sites of the samples. Fig. 4 shows the NH3-TPD on silica-based samples and CO2-TPD for Mg3AlO sample, and the results are summarized in Table 2 . Fig. 4 indicates that NH3 is removed mostly at around 350K from silica-based samples but only the mixed oxides SiO2–TiO2 and SiO2–ZrO2 present acidity at high temperatures. The highest acid site density was obtained on Pt/SiO2–ZrO2 whereas the lowest was for Pt/MgAl-c. The acidity presented by the latter is attributed to the aluminum oxide species in the calcined mixed oxide, as reported in the literature [34,35]. Moreover, this MgAl material was the only sample with basic sites, as the analysis by CO2 thermodesorption demonstrates. The addition of Pt to the support increases the acidity of the material, caused by the platinum compound used as precursor. The following acidity strength trend was determined: Pt/SiO2–ZrO2 >Pt/SiO2–TiO2 >Pt/SiO2–AB>Pt/MgAl-c. The basic/acid site density ratio for the Pt/MgAl-c sample was ∼36, indicating this material behaves as a base solid, with a strong basicity present at high temperatures (650K). Pyridine FTIR demonstrated the presence of Lewis and Brönsted acid sites. The results are shown in Fig. 5 with the adsorption spectra of pyridine for several samples and different temperatures. Peaks at 1545cm−1 wavelength are known as Brönsted type acid sites and those at 1455cm−1 are characteristic of Lewis acidity [36]. The signals appearing at 1500cm−1 are attributed to the contribution of both types of acid sites. SiO2–AB sample presented low temperature acid sites, which are related to the sol–gel synthesis employed. The presence of acid sites on pure silica determined by pyridine adsorption has been reported before [37,38]. Mixed oxides such as SiO2–TiO2 [39] and SiO2–ZrO2 [40] have been reported as materials containing both Lewis and Brönsted acid sites; and in this work Fig. 5 corroborates the finding. SiO2–ZrO2 sample shows the highest desorption temperature of all samples, indicating it possesses strong acid sites present at 716K. Both NH3-TPD and FTIR-Py agree on the acid determinations."
10,Reaction,"3.5 Reaction Citral molecule has three sites susceptible to hydrogenation: a carbonyl group (CO), a double bond (CC) conjugate to the carbonyl and an isolated double bond (CC) so that the hydrogenation reaction can proceed by any of the reaction routes shown in Fig. 6 . In this sense, the polarity of citral guides the way the molecule approaches the hydrogenation sites on the catalyst surface. Hence, the physicochemical properties of the catalysts, and specifically the acid–base nature of the catalytic surface influences the adsorption mode of the molecule, and favors the selective production of hydrogenated compounds. The catalytic results obtained at short times are presented in Fig. 7 . In this figure it is observed that catalysts with acid nature (Pt/SiO2–TiO2 and Pt/SiO2–ZrO2) promote the formation of unsaturated alcohols (nerol and geraniol) whereas basic materials induce the formation of citronellal, as the main product. It is possible to explain the results as follows: it is assumed that the electron pair over the oxygen atom in the citral molecule is attracted by acid centers on the surface; this adsorption promotes the hydrogenation of the carbonyl oxygen to obtain nerol and geraniol. There was no evidence of the presence of products resulting from the hydrogenation of the isolated CC (3,7-dimetil-2-octenal). For the Pt/SiO2-AB catalyst, considered as a reference, which has low acidity (56.6nmol/m2), the only product was citronellal. We suppose that on an acid support there is an electronic charge transfer from the metallic particle to the support, providing an acid character (δ+) to Pt. This effect together with the polarity of the citral molecule causes citral to adsorb preferably through the carbonyl group as depicted in Fig. 8I. In this way the hydrogenation of the carbonyl to produce unsaturated alcohols is favored. Based on XPS experiments, Álvarez-Rodríguez et al. [41] reported the formation of Ptδ+ with electron deficit in catalysts using acid supports, which in turn brings an increase in the production of unsaturated alcohols. Moreover, the adsorption of citral through the carbonyl group on Lewis acid sites such as those present on SiO2–TiO2 and SiO2–ZrO2, as shown in Fig. 8II has been widely reported. On the other hand, on supports with basic character there is an electronic charge transfer from the support to the Pt particle providing a basic character (δ−) increasing its electronic density [41]. This effect hinders the adsorption of citral through the oxygen electron pair of the carbonyl and promotes the hydrogenation of the conjugate CC double bond, Fig. 9I. Similarly, the adsorption of citral on the basic catalytic support through the carbonyl is not favored because of electronic repulsion, so that in the metal–support interface the hydrogenation of the conjugate CC bond is preferred, Fig. 9II. It is also interesting to note that the activity is higher for the basic materials, despite the fact that they have lower surface areas but lower platinum particle sizes, and higher pore diameters. The most active catalyst was Pt/MgAl-c with an initial activity of 1.5μmols−1 gcat. The smaller metal particle size and high average pore diameter, alone, are not sufficient to account for the five-fold higher activity of the basic catalyst, as compared to the acid silica-based materials. Therefore, the result suggests the presence of an electronic effect due to the basic character of the catalyst, as suggested before in the literature [23,41,42]. Moreover, it is possible to foresee that the density and strength of the basicity of the support to play a significant role in the catalytic performance. As reaction proceeds the product distribution maintains the same trend, Fig. 10 , and corresponds to a range of products resulting of the subsequent hydrogenation of citronellal (citronellol and 3,7-dimethyl octanal), traces of the saturated alcohol (3,7-dimethyl octanol) and the presence of products from the other reaction routes. Catalysts of a basic nature continue as the most active reaching a 100% conversion of citral after 50min reaction time. These results agree with previous report by Zgolicz et al. [42] showing high catalytic activities in the hidrogenationn of citral using Pt supported on MgAl mixed oxides. The traces of unsaturated alcohol obtained for basic Pt/MgAl-r catalysts after 50min of reaction can be attributed to the hydrophilic nature of citral, because of the presence of water provided during rehydration of the MgAl mixed oxide, which induces the adsorption of citral via the carbonyl group. This promoting effect during the hydrogenation of citral was recently reported by Jiang et al. [43]. According to the product distribution, the formation of unsaturated alcohols (nerol–geraniol) is directly related to the acidity of the support and the selectivity follows the trend: Pt/SiO2–ZrO2 >Pt/SiO2–TiO2 >Pt/SiO2–AB>Pt/MgAl-c. On the Pt/SiO2-ZrO2 catalyst the hydrogenation of citral gives a nerol–geraniol yield of 80% after 8h of reaction. And, during this period no other side reactions or decarboxylation products were detected. At long reaction times, on basic catalysts (Pt/MgAl-c and Pt/MgAl-r) the hydrogenation of citronellal occurs via the attack on the isolated CC bond to obtain 3,7-dimethyloctanal, rather than the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group. Zgolicz et al. [42] detect the same product with Pt (5wt%) supported on MgAl mixed oxides. On acid catalysts citronellal is hydrogenated via the carbonyl group to obtain citronellol. All these results are summarized in Fig. 11 where the different reaction routes and corresponding catalysts are shown."
11,Conclusions,"Platinum catalysts supported on mixed oxides materials present a combination of Lewis–Brönsted acid sites having a strength tendency given by: Pt/SiO2–ZrO2 >Pt/SiO2–TiO2 >Pt/SiO2–AB>MgAl-c. The polarity of the citral molecule combined with the surface electronic distribution (acid–base properties) from the support induces the citral hydrogenation to take place by a specific route. Unsaturated alcohols production is related to the strength and density of acid sites from the catalytic surface; hence in the Pt/SiO2–ZrO2 nerol and geraniol are the main products. Basic catalytic material Pt/MgAl-c presents the highest activity and high selectivity to citronellal. The high activity is related to the smaller particle size of Pt, although electronic effects seem to be present producing the remarkable activity observed. Further studies are necessary to explain this behavior."
