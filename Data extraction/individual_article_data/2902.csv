0,Introduction,"With the burning of fossil fuels, modern lifestyles demand a steady and reliable supply of energy [1]. H2, as a clean energy, is playing an important role in social development [2,3]. Since Fujishima and Honda found that TiO2 can dissociate water to produce hydrogen under the light in 1972 [4], semiconductor materials (Cu2O, BiVO4, and C3N4) have widely attracted attention in photocatalytic applications [5–7]. Among those materials, Cu2O has been investigated as a cheap and non–toxic p–type semiconductor (1.9–2.2 eV direct band gap) [8]. Adjusting the morphology of crystals is very important because their electronic structure, bonding and surface energy are directly related to their shape [9]. The Cu2O with different shapes, such as nanospheres, nanocubes, nanowires, octahedrons, concave hexapod microcrystals and concave cubes, have been synthesized in the last decade [10–12]. Unique morphologies could provide several active facets and superior photocatalytic performance [13]. However, the poor charge separation of pure Cu2O limits its photocatalytic applications. Coupling Cu2O with metal oxides is a feasible strategy to enhance the separation rate of photogenerated electron‒hole pairs [14]. Nowadays, different heterojunctions including coupling with metal (Au, Cu) [15,16], non–metal materials (GO, RGO) [17,18] and semiconductors (WO3, TiO2) [19,20] were investigated to improve the photocatalytic ability of Cu2O. Among these materials, TiO2 with a wide band gap of 3.20 eV [21], as a non–toxic and stable n–semiconductor, has been widely used in reducing CO2, degrading organic compounds and splitting water [22–24]. Recently, Cu2O/TiO2 composites have been investigated to overcome the shortcomings of single material due to its wide absorption of visible light, narrow band gap, and efficient separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. Kumar et al. [25] reported that TiO2 nanorods modified with Cu2O can efficiently enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate. Liu et al. fabricated a Cu2O@TiO2 core–shell composite for the degradation of methylene blue. These ways of synthesizing Cu2O/TiO2 composites were in situ method, but this process can change the original morphology of Cu2O. Therefore, the synthesis of Cu2O/TiO2 composites with intricate morphology and high photocatalytic performance is crucial. Herein, dendritic branching Z-scheme Cu2O/TiO2 composite photocatalyst were prepared via a facile physical mixture, demonstrating superior photocatalytic H2 production activity. Interestingly, the Cu2O and TiO2 are attracted to each other by electrostatic interaction in the reaction solution, resulting in efficient charge separation. The photocatalytic H2 production rate of CT–70 (Cu2O coupled with 70 wt% TiO2) sample achieves 14.020 mmol g−1 in 6 h, which was 264 and 44 times higher than that of pure Cu2O and TiO2, respectively."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemical reagents,"2.1 Chemical reagents Cu(Ac)2·H2O (99%, AR), dioctyl sulfosuccinate sodium salt (AOT, ≥ 97%, Aldrich), CH3(CH2)2CH2OH (≥99.5%, Kermel), ascorbic acid (≥99.7%, Kermel), CH3COONa·3H2O (99%, AR), TiCl4 (99%, AR), citric acid (C6H8O7·H2O, ≥ 99.5%, AR), absolute ethyl alcohol (C2H5OH, ≥ 99.7%, Kermel) and ultrapure water (18.25 MΩ cm) were used. All chemicals were used as purchased without further purification unless otherwise noted."
3,Synthesis of dendritic Cu2O,"2.2 Synthesis of dendritic Cu2O Dendritic Cu2O was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method and the temperature of reaction keeps 15 °C. Firstly, 0.0800 g Cu(Ac)2·H2O and 0.4890 g AOT were dissolved in 60 mL ultrapure water and 20 mL normal butanol respectively. Next, the cupric acetate solution was added into the AOT solution and the resulted solution was stirred for 1 h. Then, 0.0880 g ascorbic acid was added into the solution and stirred for 30 min, and 1.0886 g CH3COONa·3H2O was put in the solution under constant stirring for 120 min. We transferred the solution to a 100 mL Teﬂon–lined stainless steel autoclave and heated to 130 °C while maintaining for 240 min, then cooled naturally. The product was centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 3 min and washed with deionized water and ethyl alcohol absolute three times respectively. Eventually, the Cu2O samples were kept at 60 °C."
4,Synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles,2.3 Synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles The TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized by a hydrothermal method according to our previous work [26].
5,Synthesis of Cu2O/TiO2 composite,"2.4 Synthesis of Cu2O/TiO2 composite The Cu2O/TiO2 composites were synthesized via a simple physical mixing way. In order to create the Cu2O/TiO2 composite with different TiO2 content, 0.0480 g, 0.0800 g, 0.0960 g, 0.1120 g, 0.1280 g TiO2 and 0.1120 g, 0.0800g, 0.0640 g, 0.0480 g, 0.0320 g Cu2O will be prepared, and Cu2O and its corresponding TiO2 were transferred into a 100 mL beaker. Next, 10 mL absolute ethyl alcohol was added into 100 mL beaker with vigorous magnetic stirring for 10 min. Finally, these composites were centrifuged and washed one time with absolute ethyl alcohol, and then dried at 60 °C overnight. These samples were labeled as CT-30, CT-50, CT–60, CT–70, CT–80, respectively."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization XRD data were carried out by German Bruker D8 diffractometer equipment. The morphology of the sample was characterized by FESEM (JSM–7001F). The morphology and lattice structure were carried out using HRTEM. The XPS measurements were taken on a Thermo Fisher Scientific (USA). The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectrum was obtained using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV–U3900, Hitachi). The photoluminescence spectra (PL F–7000, Hitachi, Japan) were collected on a fluorescence spectrophotometer with the excitation source at 330 nm. Zeta potential data were measured via the ZetaPlus from Brookhaven Instrument Corporation. The photocatalytic H2 evolution was analyzed by gas chromatograph. EIS was measured by a CHI660E electrochemical workstation with a three–electrode analysis system. The glassy carbon electrode, Pt sheet and Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. Cross–linking agent is 5% nafion solution (DuPont). The electrolyte was prepared with 1.8638 g KCl (0.1 mM), 0.5280 g K4Fe(CN)6·3H2O (5 mM) and 0.4115 g K3Fe(CN)6 (5 mM) in 250 volumetric flask. The instruments and reagents used to measure the photocurrent of the sample were FTO electrode as the working electrode and 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution as the electrolyte. The light intensity was 52–54 mW cm−2. The Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots were obtained by using glassy carbon electrode as working electrode at a frequence of 1.0 kHz, and the electrolyte was 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The measured EFB value can be converted to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) scale via the Nernst equation [27]: (1) E N H E = E A g / A g C l + E ° A g / A g C l Where ENHE is the converted potential vs NHE, EAg/AgCl the experimental potential measured against the Ag/AgCl reference electrode and E°Ag/AgCl the standard potential of Ag/AgCl at 298K (0.197 V)."
7,Photocatalytic measurements,"2.6 Photocatalytic measurements The photocatalytic activity of samples was assessed by the hydrogen production. Firstly, the 20 mg sample was dispersed into the 80 mL test tube with 20 mL solution (H2O:CH3OH = 4:1), and the methanol is used as the sacrificial agent. Next, high–purity Ar was pumped into the bottle to expel air for 35 min. Finally the sample was dispersed by ultrasound and put into the illumination instrument for illumination. A 300 W Xe lamp was used as light source. The condensator remained on during the entire illumination process to keep the temperature constant (about 25 °C). Hydrogen production was measured every hour."
8,Computational details,"2.7 Computational details Density functional theory (DFT) was carried out using Dmol3 code [28]. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) of generalized–gradient approximation (GGA) was used to describe the exchange–correlation function [29]. The DFT semi–core pseudopotential (DSPP) method was used to treat the relativistic effect of transition metals, which replaces core electrons by a single effective potential [30]. The convergence tolerance was set as 1.0 × 10−5 Hatree in energy and the 0.002 Hatree/Å in force. The configurations of the Cu2O (110) and TiO2 (101) were selected according the TEM analysis. The work function (Φ) was defined as (2) Φ = E v a c – E F ( E v a c : v a c u u m e n e r g y , E F : F e r m i e n e r g y )"
9,Results and discussion,"The crystal structures of as–prepared products were confirmed by XRD, and diffraction patterns are exhibited in Fig. 1 . The sharp peaks indicate the Cu2O crystal with high crystallinity. The diffraction peaks at 2θ angles of 29.55°, 36.42°, 42.30°, 61.34°, 73.53°, and 77.32° match to the standard patterns of Cu2O (JCPDS No.05–0667). Meanwhile, six diffraction peaks are indexed at 25.28°, 37.80°, 48.05°, 53.89°, 55.06°, and 62.69°, which are ascribed to TiO2 (JCPDS No. 21–1272). The results indicate that Cu2O and TiO2 were successfully prepared. The Cu2O/TiO2 composites were fabricated by physical mixing, so these diffraction peaks are match to standard patterns. The peaks of the Cu2O phase become weak with the introduction of TiO2 nanoparticles, which is due to the decrease of Cu2O content. The morphologies of Cu2O and CT–70 are shown in Fig. 2 (a)–(c). SEM images of TiO2 and low–magnification electron micrographs of pure Cu2O and CT–70 are shown in Fig. S1. Fig. S1(c) shows that the morphology of Cu2O is uniform. Fig. 2(a) illustrates the dendritic branching cuprous oxide with six orthogonal directions along the positive and negative axes of X, Y and Z. The main branches in each direction are 4–5 μm, and the secondary branches are about 600 nm in width and 1 μm in length. Although the overall size of Cu2O is relatively large, the secondary branches on the main stem could create more sites to support TiO2. Fig. S1(d) shows the presence of aggregates of TiO2 nanoparticles apart from Cu2O/TiO2 composites. Not all TiO2 nanoparticles are properly distributed on the Cu2O surface by physical mixing, and they tend to cluster on their own. Given their small size with high surface energies, TiO2 nanoparticles tend to gather together to reduce the overall surface energy [31]. Fig. 2(b) and (c) shows the morphology of CT–70 composites and demonstrates clearly that several TiO2 nanoparticles stick to the smooth surface of Cu2O tightly. The results of elemental mapping are shown in Fig. 2(d)–(f). Red, yellow, and green correspond to Cu, Ti, and O respectively, and suggesting that TiO2 is well distributed on the Cu2O surface. The microstructure of sample CT–70 was further investigated by TEM and HR–TEM in Fig. 2(g)–(i), and the TEM images of pure Cu2O and TiO2 are shown in Fig. S2. In Fig. S2(d), TiO2 nanoparticles have sizes ranging from 10 nm to 20 nm. Fig. 2(g) shows that TiO2 attaches well to the surface of Cu2O. Fig. 2(h) indicates multiple lattice spacings, including interplanar spacing of 0.35 and 0.24 nm corresponding to the (101) and (111) planes of TiO2 and Cu2O. Fig. 2(i) exhibits diffraction rings according to the polycrystalline behavior of anatase TiO2 crystallites in dendritic Cu2O. Several experiments were performed to explore the process of morphology evolution. The following conclusions were obtained. First, the etching process of the main branches can be observed from smooth to rough by experiments of different heating times (Fig. S3), and ascorbic acid plays an important role as etching an agent in the entire process [32,33]. Second, hexahedral secondary branch of Cu2O is produced when the optimal amount of Cu2+ cations added is changed, and the overall morphology is not uniform (Fig. S4). Third, NaAc·3H2O is the key compound affecting surface smoothness (Fig. S5). The rough surface would be obtained if the amount of sodium acetate added is decreased. Fourth, the secondary branches are not obvious when the dosage of NaAOT is reduced (Fig. S6). Thus, in this hydrothermal system, the reaction time, Cu2+ cations, and NaAOT are the main parameters for adjusting the structure of secondary branches. The XPS data in Fig. 3 provide evidence on the valence states of Cu and Ti. Fig. S7 shows the full XPS spectra of products, which verify the presence of C, O, Cu, and Ti elements. The peaks of Fig. 3(a) at 932.16 and 951.96 eV belong to Cu(I) 2p3/2 and Cu(I) 2p1/2, respectively, suggesting the presence of Cu2O [34]. Meanwhile, the peaks at 934.18 and 954.28 eV correspond to Cu(II) 2p3/2 and Cu(II) 2p1/2 in Fig. 3(a), implying the presence of oxidized Cu2+ species in the samples [35], which is due to the sample exposure to air. The XPS spectra of Cu 2p in the pure Cu2O and composites show that the binding energy of composites is higher than that of Cu2O. This shift of binding energy values is attributed to the redistribution of electric charge in the composite materials [36]. Fig. 3(b) shows that the spectrum of Ti 2p illustrates two peaks at 458.70 and 464.30 eV, which correspond to Ti (IV) 2p3/2 and Ti (IV) 2p1/2, respectively, which prove the formation of TiO2. When the compound amount of TiO2 is increased, the strength of Cu+ in Fig. 3(a) decreases gradually. The peak values of Ti4+ increase gradually (Fig. 3(b)), and this result is confirmed by XRD. UV–vis spectroscopy of dendritic branching Cu2O, TiO2 nanoparticles, and Cu2O/TiO2 composites was performed to evaluate the light‒harvesting capacity of the samples (Fig. 3(c)). The band gap absorption edge of TiO2 is 400 nm, and Cu2O shows a light absorption threshold at about 681 nm. For the Cu2O/TiO2 samples, with increasing amount of TiO2, CT–70 exhibits maximum absorption intensity. And a slight red shift of the absorption edges is observed compared with that of TiO2 and Cu2O. This result suggests that the energy required for the electron transition decreases. The added TiO2 may cause surface defects of Cu2O and generates defect levels that reduce the energy of electron transitions [37]. The band gap of Cu2O, TiO2, and CT–70 could be calculated by the formula [38]: (3) α h ν = A ( h ν – E g ) n / 2 where α, h, ν, A, and Eg are the absorption coefficient, Planck constant, light frequency, a constant, and the band gap, respectively. The value of n depends on whether the semiconductor has a direct or indirect band gap. The direct band gap Cu2O is 1, and the indirect band gap TiO2 is 4. Therefore, the band gap of Cu2O can be estimated using the plots of (αhν)2 versus hν in Fig. 3(d). TiO2 can be figured from (αhν)1/2 vs. hν in Fig. S8. The final result of calculation is that the band gaps of Cu2O, TiO2, and CT–70 are 1.93, 3.13, and 1.86 eV, respectively. The small band gap of CT–70 is also one of the reasons for the excellent hydrogen production performance. Fig. 4 (a) is the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of Cu2O, TiO2, and Cu2O/TiO2 composites with different composite amounts. The diameter of the semicircle represents the charge transfer resistance (Rct). The smaller the diameter, the higher the efficiency of charge transfers at the semiconductor interface. The plot shows that the Rct of CT–70 is the smallest among prepared catalysts, which suggests that CT–70 has the smallest resistance to electron transfer and the fastest electron–transfer rate. Electrochemical methods are powerful tools to detect the strength of photocurrent. Herein, the intensity of the photocurrent is a good indicator of the material to investigate the ability of photons to convert into electricity. The concise steps are as follows. First, the FTO electrode was sonicated in acetone, ethanol, and ultrapure water for 10 min, respectively. Second, 1 mg of the sample was dispersed into a 1 mL H2O. Finally, the 100 μL mixed solution was dropped onto the FTO, and an area of 1 cm2 was identified. Fig. 4(b) exhibits the photocurrent data of Cu2O and Cu2O/TiO2 composites, and TiO2 data (1.6 μA cm−2) was provided in Fig. S9. This result indicates clearly that the CT–70 composite showed the strongest photocurrent response (12 μA cm−2). The photocurrent density response and photocatalytic efficiency of Cu2O and Cu2O/TiO2 composites both follow the order of CT–70 > CT–80 > CT–60 > Cu2O. The photocurrent responses of samples are significantly affected by the amount of TiO2. When the ratio of Cu2O:TiO2 reaches the optimal value, the photogenerated electron‒hole pairs also exhibits the highest separation efficiency. Thus, CT–70 shows the greatest photocurrent response. Fig. S10 shows the PL spectrum of the as–prepared samples, which was excited at 330 nm. In comparison with the spectra of pure Cu2O and TiO2, the PL emission peaks intensity of the composite materials show a decay behavior, and CT–70 exhibits the lowest intensity. This result indicates CT–70 has the lowest carrier recombination rate among the pre–prepared catalysts. Mott–Schottky (M–S) curve were measured to determine the band structure of semiconductors. In Fig. 4(c), the negative slope of the Mott–Schottky plot suggests that Cu2O is p–type semiconductor. The intersection of the X–axis and the tangent of the curve indicates that the valence band (VB) edge of Cu2O is 1.06 V versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). Oppositely, Fig. 4(d) shows the positive slope of the M–S plot of the TiO2, which is characteristic of n–type semiconductors. The conduction band (CB) edge of TiO2 is −0.55 V versus NHE. The photocatalytic hydrogen was measured to assess the photocatalytic activities of the catalysts. The hydrogen production of CT–30 and CT–50 is shown in Fig. S11. Fig. 5 (a) indicates that CT–70 shows the highest hydrogen production among these catalysts, with photocatalytic activity in the order CT–70 > CT–80 > CT–60 > TiO2 > Cu2O. The highest hydrogen production is 14.020 mmol g−1 in 6 h light illumination, which is 264 and 44 times higher than those of pure Cu2O (0.053 mmol g−1) and pure TiO2 (0.315 mmol g−1). The H2 yields of CT–80 and CT–60 are 12.444 and 10.616 mmol g−1 in 6 h, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the CT–70 can keep high activity for 18 h. The superior stability is due to the presence of sufficient TiO2 on the Cu2O surface, and TiO2 protects Cu2O from photocorrosion. Fig. S12 shows that Cu2O, TiO2, CT–60, CT–70, and CT–80 produce 0.009, 0.061, 1.769, 2.337, and 2.074 mmol g−1 h−1 H2 on average, respectively. Table S1 is given in the supporting information and shows a comparison of the photocatalytic activity with some of the reported composites based on Cu2O. From a comparison, our photocatalyst exhibits a satisfactory photocatalytic performance. The greater photocatalytic activity of the Cu2O/TiO2 composites compared with that of bare Cu2O could be attributed to 1) low resistance of charge transfer, and 2) high carrier separation rate. For this experiment, it is necessary to measure the zeta potential. Since the synthesis method of Cu2O/TiO2 composites is physical mixing, the closeness of contact between the two photocatalysts also has a crucial influence on the photocatalytic activity. Fig. S13 exhibits the zeta potential of Cu2O and TiO2 in pH = 7 water solution. The Cu2O exist a zeta potential of −10.17 mV, which indicates a large number of negative charges on the surface of Cu2O. The TiO2 shows a zeta potential value of +10.49 mV, which suggests the surface of TiO2 with positive charge. Therefore, Cu2O and TiO2 can always be in close contact during the photocatalytic process due to electrostatic force of attraction. In other words, the TiO2 can form a protective layer on the Cu2O surface. When the optimal compound content is reached, it can guarantee that the surface of Cu2O/TiO2 composites retains enough TiO2 to protect the Cu2O and that light is utilized efficiently. In addition, a large amount of TiO2 nanoparticles can also form enough contact points on the surface of Cu2O to ensure excellent photocatalytic activity and cycling stability. However, in the presence of excessive TiO2, the TiO2 dispersed in the solution shields the light illumination, thereby reducing the overall photocatalytic performance. Density functional theory (DFT) computational calculations were performed to investigate the interfacial charge transfer between Cu2O and TiO2 [39,40]. According to Fig. 2(h) and Fig. S14, the main exposed surfaces of Cu2O and TiO2 are the (110) and (101) planes, respectively. Fig. 6 (a) and (b) exhibits the DFT calculated potential diagrams of the Cu2O (110) facet and TiO2 (101) facet, and the work functions are 4.54 and 6.39 eV, respectively. In Fig. 6(c), when the Cu2O and TiO2 come into contact, the smaller work function of Cu2O suggests that the electrons of at the Cu2O surface will transfer to surface of TiO2 until the Femi level equilibrium. Therefore, at the interface, the charge on the Cu2O surface is positive, whereas the charge on TiO2 is negative. This charge transfer result will construct electric fields at the interface, which is more beneficial for the transfer and separation of charge between Cu2O and TiO2 in the photoctalytic progress. Instantaneous free radical intermediates in the photocatalytic reaction system of Cu2O, TiO2, and Cu2O/TiO2 using DMPO as spin alternation were detected by the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) method under Xe light irradiation (Fig. 7 (a) and (b)) to prove the charge carrier transfer mechanism of the binary Cu2O/TiO2 composites [41]. According to M–S plots and UV–vis spectra, the VB values of Cu2O and TiO2 are 1.06 and 2.58 eV (vs. NHE), respectively, and their CB energy levels are located at −0.87 and −0.55 eV (vs. NHE), respectively. In Fig. 7(a), the DMPO–O2− signal is not detected under dark conditions. In the TiO2 photocatalytic reaction system, the DMPO–O2− signal is not also found because of the near electrode potential (O2/O2−, −0.33 eV vs. NHE) [42]. The CB potential of Cu2O is more negative than that of O2/O2− (−0.33 eV vs. NHE). Thus, the electron from CB of Cu2O can reduce O2 to produce O2−. Interestingly, the DMPO–O2− signals of the Cu2O/TiO2 signal are stronger than those of pure Cu2O, which might be attributed to the excited electrons in the CB of TiO2 transferred to the hole of Cu2O VB, and the charge carrier recombination of Cu2O is significantly inhibited. In Fig. 7(b), the DMPO–OH signals are not detected in the Cu2O photocatalytic system. The holes generated in the VB of Cu2O cannot oxidize OH− to form OH because of its more negative VB potential than that of OH−/OH (2.40 eV vs. NHE) [43]. The signals of DMPO–OH in the Cu2O/TiO2 system are stronger than those of TiO2. The enhanced signal could be explained as follows. The electrons of TiO2 VB are excited into the CB and then transferred to the VB of Cu2O. Therefore, more holes can be left on the VB level of TiO2. Commonly accepted mechanisms are traditional Type–II and direct Z–scheme heterojunction [44,45], as shown in Fig. 8 (a) and (b). If the electron transfer mode is Type–II, the photogenerated h+ on Cu2O VB could not oxidize OH− into OH owing to the negative potential of the VB (1.06 eV vs. NHE) compared with the standard reduction potential of OH−/OH (2.40 eV vs. NHE). The signal of DMPO–OH in EPR measurement should be decreased. Therefore, our photocatalytic mechanism could not be Type–II modes. Giving that the above research and analysis results, the Z–scheme mode is more reasonable to explain the water splitting in the Cu2O/TiO2 photocatalytic reaction system. Under simulated sunlight, photo‒excited electrons migrate from the CB of TiO2 to the VB of Cu2O and then recombine with the photogenerated holes in the VB of Cu2O, so that the electrons with high reducibility and the holes with strong oxidizability can be preserved [44,46]."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, the dendritic branching Cu2O was fabricated by a hydrothermal method, and the Z-scheme Cu2O/TiO2 composite photocatalysts were obtained by surface charge modulation. The CT–70 (Cu2O coupled with 70 wt% TiO2) sample shows excellent photocatalytic H2-production activity, which is 264 and 44 times higher than that of pure Cu2O and TiO2, respectively. The boosting photocatalytic performance might be ascribed to the wide range of light absorption and efficient separation of photogenerated electron–hole. Furthermore, the Z-scheme mechanism was proposed and proved by DFT calculation and EPR results to explain the electron transfer pathway. This work provides a new prospect for the rational design and assembly of highly efficient Z–scheme photocatalysts."
