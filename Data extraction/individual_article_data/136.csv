0,Introduction,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is regarded as a green and benign oxidant, which has been widely used for chemical industry, biological process and environmental remediation, and water is the only final byproduct [1–5]. Besides, H2O2 can be an ideal and promising alternative of hydrogen (H2) as an energy carrier because of its high energy density (1.72 MJ/kg in 50 wt% aqueous H2O2) [2,6,7]. Industrially, about 95 % of H2O2 production in the world is manufactured via the anthraquinone method. However, this process consumes a large amount of energy and organic solvents [8–10]. An alternative route of direct synthesis through catalyzing combination of H2 and O2 over noble metal-based catalysts, is as well limited by the potential explosion risk [10,11]. Thus, to meet the growing demand of H2O2 consumption in the word [12], environmentally friendly, energy-saving and safe methods are extremely required. Photocatalytic H2O2 production has attracted increasing interests, because the process requires only water, oxygen and sunlight as raw materials, and is a promising way to convert the low-density solar energy into storable chemical energy [9,13–16]. In this solar-to-fuel process, the catalysts driven by solar light are known to produce photo-excited electrons to reduce oxygen and produce H2O2, which is through a multi-step one-electron (Eqs. 1 and 2) or a one-step two-electron (Eq. 3) process [1,17,18]. Many photocatalysts have been investigated for H2O2 production, such as TiO2 [1,17,19–22], bismuth-based materials [7,10,23–27], graphitic C3N4 [3,14,28–31], and CdS/graphene [32]. Among them, TiO2 is still one of the most intensively investigated photocatalytic materials due to its advantages including low cost, innocuity and high stability [33]. Nevertheless, TiO2 exhibits a low efficiency in H2O2 production, which can be attributed to the three restrictions: (i) the inherently significant electron-hole recombination [9]; (ii) the dominated one-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is the rate-limiting step for H2O2 formation [4,17,34]; (iii) simultaneous decomposition of adsorbed H2O2 on TiO2 (in the form of TiOOH) by photogenerated holes under both visible light and UV illumination [17,35]. In view of above limitations, surface modification of TiO2 are employed to improve H2O2 production, including surface fluorination [36], loading of noble metals such as Au or Au-Ag [1,11], and cooperation with inorganic cations such as Cu2+ [19], or anions like phosphate ions [13,37]. (1) O 2 + e - → O 2 · - → H + H O 2 · (2) H O 2 · + H + + e - → H 2 O 2 (3) O 2 + 2 H + + 2 e - → H 2 O 2 On the other hand, electron donors (e.g. alcohols) are required to improve H2O2 production, because water oxidation by photogenerated holes is very slow, which would result in significant recombination of photogenerated charges. Among the currently reported electron donors, aliphatic alcohols such as isopropyl alcohol are frequently applied [4,9,38]. However, the role of electron donors in photocatalytic H2O2 production has been underestimated, and there are very few studies on the effect of electron donors on H2O2 production. When aliphatic alcohols solely applied in TiO2 suspensions, H2O2 production is unfortunately low efficient and highly pH-dependent due to the existence of above three restrictions [4,39]. Recently, aromatic alcohols, such as benzyl alcohol (BA) and 1-phenylethanol, were investigated as electron donors for H2O2 production, and the systems displayed enhanced H2O2 photosynthesis [40]. Moreover, electron delocalization on the aromatic rings in the alcohol molecules has the potential to alter the ORR pathway in H2O2 production [40–42]. This indicates that optimization of electron donors has the potential to target the limitations of H2O2 production in TiO2 suspensions. However, the role of aromatic alcohols in H2O2 production has not been fully understood, and it is not clear about which alcohol is the most proper and effective electron donor for photocatalytic H2O2 production. Herein, the effects of different electron donors (including three aliphatic alcohols, one aromatic alcohol and two aromatic heterocyclic alcohols) on H2O2 production in TiO2 suspensions were investigated. The interaction between typical alcohols and TiO2 surface was highlighted, and their mechanistic contribution was revealed according to the results from H2O2 formation and decomposition kinetics, theoretical calculation, electrochemistry and Raman spectra analyses."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Sodium perchlorate (NaClO4), hydrofluoric acid (HF), 2-Thiophenemethanol (TPA) and methanol (MeOH) were provided by Sinopharm Group Co. Ltd., China. Ethanol (EtOH) and furfural alcohol (FFA) were purchased from Shanghai Titan Scientific Co. Ltd., China. Horseradish peroxidase (POD, RZ > 1.5) was purchased from the Sangon Biotech Co. Ltd., China. Isopropanol (IPA) and benzyl alcohol (BA) were obtained from Aladdin Biochemical Technology, and N, N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD, 97 %) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Degussa P25 TiO2 (composed of 29 % rutile and 71 % anatase) was used in all the experiments. Furfural alcohol-D2 (FFA-D2) was purchased from Beijing Innochem Science &Technology co. Ltd, China."
3,Photocatalytic H2O2 production,"2.2 Photocatalytic H2O2 production TiO2 (30 mg) was suspended in a 30 mL alcohol solution in a quartz cuvette. The initial pH was adjusted to 3.0 by 1 M HClO4. Various alcohols were added as the electron donors. After 5 min ultrasonication, the suspension was purged with oxygen in the whole test and irradiated under simulated sunlight (λ > 300 nm) or visible light (λ > 420 nm) by employing a 500 W Xe lamp as the light source. The samples were taken and filtered through 0.22 μm filters for H2O2 measurements. The concentration of H2O2 was measured by a modified DPD-POD method [34,43]. The method for the kinetic rate constants of formation (k f) and decomposition (k d) of H2O2 was described in Text S1. The concentration of furfural alcohol was analyzed by a high-performance liquid chromatography at room temperature (LC-2010AHT, Shimadzu) with a C18 column. The mobile phase was comprised of 75 % phosphoric acid solution (0.1 wt%) and 25 % methanol, the flow rate was 1 mL/min, and the wavelength for detection was 220 nm. Surface fluorinated TiO2 (F/TiO2) was synthesized by adding 30 mL of HF (10 mM) into 30 mL of TiO2 suspension (5 g/L) with continuous stirring for 12 h. The suspension was centrifuged at 5000 rpm and washed thoroughly with water. Then, the obtained powders were dried at 60 °C for 12 h to obtain F/TiO2. The photocatalytic H2O2 production on F/TiO2 was carried out under the same conditions as TiO2. The ratios of decomposition rate constants (Rkd , Eq. 4) between the systems of F-TiO2 (kd0 ) and TiO2 (kd1 ) were calculated to evaluate the effect of surface fluorination. The Rkd error was calculated according to the error propagation method as shown in Text S2. (4) R k d = k d 0 k d 1"
4,Characterizations and analyses,"2.3 Characterizations and analyses To investigate the TiO2-alcohol interaction, the optical absorption properties of TiO2 with alcohols were measured by a UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer (DRS, Lambda 950, PerkinElmer Instrument). The substrate adsorbed TiO2 samples were prepared by continuously stirring a TiO2 suspension (1 g/L) with 130 mM alcohols for 30 min. After filtration and vacuum drying, the obtained alcohols-adsorbed TiO2 powder was diluted by barium sulfate (TiO2/BaSO4 = 1:50 by weight) for UV–vis DRS measurements. Photocurrent measurements were taken by using a three-electrode cell connected to a CHI760E system, and a 500 W Xe lamp (λ > 300 nm) was employed as the light source. The Pt wire and Hg/HgCl2 electrode were employed as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The working electrode was fabricated by the doctor-blade method using a TiO2 slurry, which was prepared by dispersing 100 mg of TiO2 in 1 mL of absolute ethanol. The coated ITO electrodes were heated at 200 °C for 2 h. The electrolyte was 0.1 M NaClO4 at pH = 3.5 in the presence of different alcohols (130 mM), and continuously purged by N2 for 10 min before the beginning of light irradiation. Mott-Schottky plots were performed over the frequency of 1.5 kHz at a 5 mV amplitude AC voltage in 0.1 M NaClO4 at pH 6.0 [34]. The electron transfer number in ORR was investigated by rotating disc electrode (RDE) tests on glassy carbon electrodes (GCE, Pine Co. Ltd). The TiO2 powder (2 mg) were immersed in 1 mL of ethanol with IPA, BA or FFA (0.26 mmol) for 30 min, and were ultrasonically treated to form a homogenous TiO2 ink. The ink (10 μL) was adhered onto GCE and employed as the working electrode. The RDE tests were performed by measuring linear sweep voltammetry at the scan speed of 50 mV/s with the rotating rates from 0 to 1225 rpm in a NaClO4 electrolyte (0.1 M, pH = 3.5), and a stable flow of O2 was maintained during the whole tests. The number of electron transfer was calculated by the Koutecky-Levich equation (Text S3). Peroxide species generated on TiO2 surface during photocatalytic H2O2 production was recorded on a Raman spectrometer (Acton sp2500i, Princeton Instrument) at room temperature under the excitation of 532 nm. The samples were collected by separating the powder from the illuminated TiO2 suspensions with or without alcohols and followed by dewatering in a vacuum dryer for 12 h. The main products in photocatalytic oxidation were detected by GC–MS (Shimadzu, GCMS-QP2020). First-principle calculations performed within the density functional theory (DFT) framework were used to calculate the EHOMO and ELUMO of alcohols, and to investigate adsorption of alcohols on TiO2 (Text S4) [44,45]."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Photocatalytic H2O2 production,"3.1 Photocatalytic H2O2 production Fig. 1 A shows the time courses of H2O2 production in 120 min photoreaction under simulated sunlight (λ > 300 nm). Six kinds of alcohols (130 mM) are used as the electron donors, and H2O2 production is in the order of FFA > TPA > BA > IPA > EtOH > MeOH. Therein, MeOH and EtOH are almost ineffective, and H2O2 production is comparable to that in the absence of any alcohol. IPA is a typical electron donor that has been frequently used in H2O2 production. However, H2O2 production is very low in the TiO2/IPA system, and its concentration increases to only 90 μM at 120 min. In contrast, H2O2 production is significantly high in the presence of the alcohols with aromatic structures like BA, TPA and FFA. After 120 min illumination, the H2O2 concentration in the TiO2/BA system reaches 423 μM, which is about 4.5 times of that in the TiO2/IPA system. In the presence of TPA or FFA, the two molecules with aromatic heterocycles, the systems display an even higher activity for H2O2 production, and H2O2 concentrations at 120 min are about 570 μM and 980 μM, respectively. Generally, the decomposition of H2O2 becomes significant at a high H2O2 concentration, and accordingly the increases of H2O2 would slow down with the increase of irradiation time. Different from this, the H2O2 increase in the TiO2/FFA system does not show any retarded tendency. This indicates that H2O2 decomposition is effectively suppressed in the presence of FFA. In order to investigate the mechanism on the effect of alcohol types on H2O2 production, three alcohols including IPA (aliphatic alcohol), BA (aromatic alcohol) and FFA (aromatic heterocyclic alcohol), were employed as the representative electron donors for further studies. The effect of alcohol concentrations on photocatalytic H2O2 production was investigated. As shown in Fig. 1B, H2O2 production can be enhanced with the increase of the concentrations of BA and IPA in the range of 130–1300 mM. The H2O2 concentrations at 120 min in the presence of 1300 mM of BA and IPA are 725 and 233 μM, respectively. This can be attributed to that a relatively high concentrations can promote their mass transfer from the bulk solution toward the catalyst surface, and accordingly enhancing their surface coverages and accelerating the hole scavenging [9]. However, the optimal concentration of FFA is 650 mM, at which the H2O2 concentration at 120 min can reach the highest value (1439 μM), which is much higher than the presently reported TiO2 systems [17,19–22]. However, H2O2 concentration declined with excessive FFA, suggesting the mass transfer can reach balance at a mild concentration. This indicates that the interaction of FFA with TiO2 may be stronger than that of BA and IPA, because in the latter two systems the mass transfer of electron donors is the limitation of H2O2 production at a concentration as high as 1300 mM. The effect of solution pHs on H2O2 production in the presence of the three alcohols (130 μM) is shown in Fig. S1. The amount of H2O2 production obviously decreases as pH increases in the TiO2/IPA system (Fig. S1A). However, in the presence of BA and FFA (130 mM), H2O2 production shows minor reduction (Fig. S1B and C) in the pH range from 3 to 9. Even in the alkaline condition (pH = 9), BA and FFA can induce production of 326 μM and 789 μM of H2O2 at 120 min, respectively. The results indicate that H2O2 production in the BA and FFA systems is less dependent on proton concentrations. Generally, superoxide radical, the intermediate in one-electron ORR pathway, should be stabilized by protons to form •O2H, which can disproportionate to H2O2 and O2. Because the pKa of •O2H is 4.8 [46], the significant H2O2 production at pHs above 4.8 indicates that ORR is not dominated by one-electron ORR pathway."
7,Kinetic analyses of H2O2 formation and decomposition,"3.2 Kinetic analyses of H2O2 formation and decomposition Photocatalytic H2O2 production proceeds through two concurrent and competitive reactions, which are formation and decomposition of H2O2 [22]. A kinetic model (Eq. 5) was developed to evaluate the zero-order and first-order kinetics for H2O2 formation and decomposition, respectively [9,22]. The kinetic constants for formation (k f) and decomposition (k d) of H2O2 were obtained by exponential fitting the curves in Fig. S2, and results are shown in Table S1 and Fig. 2 . (5) [ H 2 O 2 ] = ( k f / k d ) ( 1 - e ( - k d t ) ] According to Fig. 2A, in the presence of 130 mM alcohols, the kd values for the TiO2/BA (0.031 min−1) and TiO2/FFA systems (0.017 min−1) are much lower than that for the TiO2/IPA system (0.096 min−1), indicating H2O2 decomposition in the former two systems is dramatically suppressed. This may be ascribed to that BA and FFA molecules can bound onto TiO2 surface and compete with H2O2 adsorption. Fig. 2B shows the results on H2O2 formation rate constants at different concentrations of alcohols. The TiO2/FFA system possesses the highest kf at all ranges of concentrations. Moreover, in the presence of 130 mM alcohols, the kf obtained in the TiO2/BA system (10.86 μM min-1) is close to that of TiO2/IPA (9.11 μM min-1), revealing that the increased H2O2 production in the TiO2/BA suspension is mainly owing to the inhibition of H2O2 decomposition. With the increases of the concentrations of IPA and BA, the kd values decrease and kf increase. This can be understood by their enhanced mass transportation and surface coverages. However, the effect of FFA concentrations is more complicated. The kd declines at 650 mM and then increases at 1300 mM; and the variation of kf is opposite. This may be ascribed to the increased shielding of TiO2 surface by excessive FFA, which can reduce the accessibility of oxygen to TiO2 surface for electron scavenging, so as to decrease the formation of H2O2. Therefore, the combination of the changes in the formation and decomposition makes the highest H2O2 production at 650 mM FFA [9,47–49]. On the basis of the kinetic analyses, the presence of FFA not only strongly impedes the H2O2 decomposition but also accelerates its formation."
8,Mechanism discussion,"3.3 Mechanism discussion 3.3.1 Surface complexes of alcohols on TiO2 Generally, H2O2 decomposition in photocatalysis is mainly through the oxidation of the TiOOH complexes on TiO2 surface by photogenerated holes. Therefore, surface modification is an important approach to decrease kd by hindering H2O2 adsorption and complex formation [1,4,50]. Since alcohols can possibly adsorb onto TiO2 surface and form meta-stable structures by deprotonation, they can modulate TiO2 surface and play more diverse roles in photocatalytic H2O2 production besides as electron donors [41,51]. The formation of complexes between alcohols and TiO2 can be supported by the changes of UV–vis DRS spectra and the significant visible light driven H2O2 production (Fig. 3 ). As shown in Fig. 3A, the visible absorption above 400 nm by TiO2 and TiO2/IPA is negligible. However, in the presence of FFA or BA, absorption can be observed even at 800 nm, and FFA induces a much stronger absorption than BA. This visible light absorption can be attributed to the effect of ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT), which is originated from the formed surface complexes between alcohols and TiO2 [42,51,52]. Moreover, both the TiO2/BA and TiO2/FFA systems can produce notable H2O2 under visible light illumination (λ > 420 nm), while the TiO2/IPA system fails to produce detectable H2O2 (Fig. 3B). Therefore, the electron-rich alcohols with aromatic units are more possible to form surface complexes than alkyl alcohols. According to the LMCT mechanism, the electrons in the complexes can be directly photoexcited to the conduction band of TiO2 for photocatalytic processes [52]. The effect of alcohol adsorption on the energy level positions of TiO2 was investigated by measuring Mott-Schottky plots. As shown in Fig. S3, the flat band potential (EFB) of TiO2 in absence of alcohols is about −0.63 V vs. NHE. The values are shifted cathodically by 0.06 and 0.17 V in the presence of 130 mM BA and FFA, respectively. This is in consistent with the previous reports that the flat band of TiO2 can cathodically shift in presence of 10 vol% ethanol [53]. However, the change of EFB is negligible in the case of IPA, which may be ascribed to the weak adsorption of IPA on TiO2. Therefore, the interaction between BA or FFA and TiO2 can induce flat band cathodic shift, which is expected to promote electron transfer for ORR. The adsorption of alcohols on TiO2 surface was investigated by DFT calculations. The adsorption energies ( E a d ) of alcohols at one molecular layer of water coverage on anatase TiO2 (101) facet was calculated by Equation S5, and the top views of their optimized geometries are shown in Fig. S4. The adsorption energies are 0.616, 0.590, 0.431 eV for FFA, BA and IPA, respectively. The positive values of E a d indicate that the adsorption of these alcohols on TiO2 is exothermal adsorption. The adsorption of FFA has the highest E a d , suggesting that it can form the most stable conformation on TiO2, and their interaction is the strongest. Fluorinated TiO2 (F-TiO2) has been reported as an effectively strategy to diminish TiOOH formation and increase H2O2 production, because fluoride anion can bind strongly on TiO2 surface [36]. To evaluate the role of interaction between alcohols and TiO2 on H2O2 production, fluorination was applied to compete adsorption of alcohols. The effect of fluorination on H2O2 production in the presence of 130 mM alcohols was explored (Fig. 4 A), and a comparison of H2O2 decomposition in TiO2 and F-TiO2 systems are shown in Fig. 4B. The order of the ratios (Rkd ) for H2O2 decomposition rates is IPA (Rkd = 0.54) <BA (Rkd = 0.71) <FFA (Rkd = 0.88). The Rkd values for FFA and BA are closer to 1, indicating that the interaction between the two alcohols and TiO2 is strong enough to suppress the formation of Ti-OOH, and the strength of interaction is even comparable to that between fluoride and TiO2. Due to the suppressed H2O2 decomposition on F-TiO2, H2O2 production on F-TiO2 is much higher than that in IPA and BA containing systems, which can be observed from Figs. 1A and 4 A. However, in the presence of FFA, although fluorination can further decrease the H2O2 decomposition rate, H2O2 production on F-TiO2 is about 12 % less than that on TiO2 in the presence of FFA. This can be ascribed to that the decreased formation rate of H2O2 on F-TiO2, because the adsorbed fluoride ions can block TiO2 surface and decrease the accessibility of FFA, leading to the retarded electron transfer from alcohol to surface photogenerated holes. This can also be indicated by the slower degradation rate of FFA (Fig. S5). Therefore, using FFA as the electron donor can simultaneously suppress the decomposition and facilitate the formation of H2O2 on TiO2. 3.3.2 Enhanced electron-hole separation Generally, photocatalytic H2O2 formation is dominated by the number of available electrons for ORR. Photocurrent measurements were carried out to investigate the effect of alcohols on the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. As shown in Fig. 5 , in the absence of alcohols and purging the electrolyte by N2, the photocurrents on TiO2 electrodes are very low, suggesting that the oxidation of water is very slow, and the electron-hole recombination is significant [54]. With the addition of alcohols, all the photocurrents dramatically increase, indicating that the consumption of photogenerated holes by alcohols is more efficient than that by water, and more free electrons are available for photocurrent generation [55]. Moreover, the addition of FFA induces the highest photocurrent, about twice of that for BA. This can be understood by the shifts of flat band. The more negative flat band in the presence of FFA has higher potential to facilitate electron transfer. The results also indicate that FFA is a more efficient hole scavenger, which can be further explained by the HOMO energies and HOMO-LUMO gaps of the three alcohols. Generally, the chemicals with a higher HOMO energy has a higher ionization potential and is more reactive with electrophilic substance [56]. As shown in Table 1 , FFA has the highest HOMO energy (-6.13 eV), followed by BA (-6.95 eV) and IPA (-7.50 eV). Therefore, FFA is the most susceptible to be attacked by photogenerated holes, the strong electrophilic species. Simultaneously, the HOMO-LUMO gap of a chemical is also a significant indication of their reactivity in chemical reactions [57], and a small gap implies a low active energy for being oxidized. According to the HOMO-LUMO gaps shown in Table 1, FFA has the minimum HOMO-LUMO gap (5.88 eV) among the three alcohols, suggesting that FFA has the highest reactivity in oxidation, which benefits to offer more electrons for H2O2 production. 3.3.3 Altered ORR pathway The electron transfer number in ORR was measured by RDE tests. The linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) of TiO2 electrodes in the absence or presence of alcohols at increased rotation speeds are shown in Fig. S6. The Koutecky-Levich (K-L) plots at different potentials can be obtained from the LSV curves. In the absence of alcohols, the plots of I−1 versus ω−1 are all linear and parallel (Fig. S7), indicating that the ORR kinetics are all first-order in the range from −0.78 to −0.84 V vs. Ag/AgCl [58,59]. According to the slopes of the fitted K-L plots, the numbers of electron transfer (n) for ORR on TiO2 are 0.88∼0.92, illustrating a one-electron dominated process [4,60]. Furthermore, the slopes of K-L curves at the potential of -0.82 V vs. Ag/AgCl in the absence or presence of alcohols in the electrolytes were compared, and results are shown in Fig. 6 . The n value for the TiO2/IPA system is 0.95 at this potential, while they are 1.42 and 2.34 for the BA and FFA containing systems, respectively. This demonstrates that both BA and FFA can alter the ORR pathway on TiO2. In the presence of BA, the ORR on TiO2 was a mixture of the one-electron and two-electron pathway; while in the presence of FFA, it was a two-electron dominated pathway. The altered ORR pathway is in consistent with results of pH effects as shown in Fig. S1, in which the BA or FFA containing system is less sensitive to proton concentrations [4,39,46]. The presence of peroxide species on the surface of illuminated TiO2 was measured to provide more indication for the altered ORR pathway. Fig. 7 shows the Raman spectra of TiO2 powders that has been collected from the O2-saturated suspensions after illuminated for 180 min in the absence or presence of alcohols. Different from the spectrum for TiO2 in the absence of alcohols (Fig. 7a), a peak at about 840 cm−1 which corresponds to the CO stretching vibration can be observed in the other three spectra (Fig. 7b–d). This can be ascribed to the adsorbed alcohols on TiO2 surface [41]. Moreover, in the presence of BA and FFA (Fig. 7c and d), an obvious new peak appears at 890 cm−1, which corresponds to the peroxide OO stretching of the sider-on peroxo species on TiO2 surface [40,41,61]. It was suggested that such an oxygen bridge bond on TiO2 surface can impede formation of superoxo radicals and hydroperoxo species (TiOOH) on TiO2, which are inevitable intermediates in the one-electron ORR pathway [40]. Therefore, the results suggest the contribution of two-electron pathway for oxygen reduction and H2O2 production in the presence of BA and FFA. Based on above results, the mechanism of the enhanced H2O2 production using BA or FFA as the electron donors can be understood. As shown in Scheme 1 , the presence of BA or FFA absorbed on TiO2 surface can form complexes (i) by deprotonation. The adsorption of alcohols enables the direct hole transfer rather than indirect one (leading to radicals) for alcohol oxidation, and competes with hydroperoxide formation to inhibit the decomposition of H2O2 significantly. Under UV light irradiation, TiO2 is excited to produce e−/h+ pairs. Then, Ti4+ sites are reduced to Ti3+ by capturing photogenerated electrons, and O2- sites are oxidized to O- by holding photogenerated holes. The β-hydrogen of the alcohol adsorbed on TiO2 can be abstracted by photogenerated holes on the O- site to form carbon radicals (ii). The KIE value of FFA/FFA-D2 is calculated to be 1.35 (Fig. S8), indicating that CH bond dissociation may be not the rate determining step in FFA photocatalytic oxidation on TiO2. Subsequently, an alcohol-oxygen bridge structure can form because both carbon radical and Ti3+ site tend to combine molecular oxygen (iii) [62,63]. It is less possible for molecular oxygen reacting with carbon center to form a peroxyl radical or binding on Ti3+ site to form hydroperoxide. The aromatic cycles like benzene or furan rings favor to stabilize this structure (iv) by promoting electron delocalization [40,64]. Then, the bond dissociation of CO and OO bonds can take place spontaneously through a heterolytic cleavage and transform into aldehyde and peroxide on Ti sites [41]. The main product in FFA photocatalytic oxidation is identified as furfural by GCMS analyses (Fig. S9). Finally, H2O2 is produced from the peroxides on Ti sites by combining protons (v). Moreover, FFA displays superior capability to promote H2O2 production in TiO2 suspensions, which can be ascribed to the stronger interaction and better reactivity with TiO2, and the higher selectivity in the two-electron reduction of oxygen."
9,Conclusion,"In summary, FFA is found to be a superior electron donor for photocatalytic H2O2 production in TiO2 suspensions. The critical roles of FFA include: (1) strong interaction with TiO2 surface to induce cathodic shifts of flat band and suppress H2O2 adsorption and decomposition, (2) high reactivity to be oxidized by photogenerated holes, and (3) enabling a highly selective two-electron ORR pathway to accelerate H2O2 formation. The results demonstrate that the selection of alcohols with aromatic rings can be a promising strategy to modulate the interfacial oxygen reduction process for highly efficient and selective photocatalytic H2O2 production systems."
