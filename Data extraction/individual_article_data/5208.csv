0,Introduction,"In the process of oil and gas exploitation, understanding the pressure information of the oil and gas wells is of great importance, which can improve the recovery rate and production of the oil and gas [1,2], but the underground oil and gas condition is extremely wicked with high temperature, high pressure and strong corrosion. The traditional electronic sensors restricted to condition within 150 °C cannot work in this harsh environment stably for long. Nowadays, fiber optic sensors with the advantages of small size, high precision, high temperature and corrosion resistance [3], have been developed for physical parameters measurements such as temperature, vibration, acceleration, minor deformation, pressure, etc., which can be used for single-point or distributed sensing [4–6] and also has a wide range of applications in the mining process of oil and gas field. Among the fiber optic sensors, Fabry–Perot (F–P) interference fiber optic sensors have aroused considerable interest of researchers to achieve measurement of certain characters, such as temperature and pressure [7]. The diaphragm-based configuration optical F–P cavity pressure sensors are more suitable for pressure measurements of high-sensitivity, such as a silica diaphragm bonded with a silica ferrule [8–10], stainless steel diaphragm and ferrule [11], and fiber sensors fabricated by MEMS [12]. The collimated capillary-based configuration optical F–P​ cavity pressure sensors are more suitable for pressure measurements of large range. An incident optical fiber and a reflection optical fiber are placed in a collimated capillary matched with the outer diameter of the optical fiber, and they are fixed utilizing epoxy resin adhesive [13], anodic bonding and glass powder sealing [14]. Among them, the large coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch will induce severe stress between different materials and crack of the sensor structure, degrading the sensor performance or causing to a failure of the sensor when heated, yet homogenous material based sensors can avoid the problems because of the same CTE. Therefore, investigations of material selection and packaging techniques without additional material are essential. Silica has a high melting point, excellent corrosion resistance, low optical loss in the fiber communication band, resistance to high temperature impact, and low CTE mismatch with fibers etc., which makes it an ideal candidate for F–P cavity pressure sensors operating in severe environments. An ultra-thin fused-silica diaphragm was welded onto the end face of a ferrule by CO2 laser welding [15,16], a micron-thick F–P cavity was fabricated on the end surface of the optical fiber by ARC discharge [17], and an F–P cavity was fabricated by femtosecond laser in single-mode fiber [18], whose spectral intensity was low affecting the dynamic range of the sensor. However, the above non-additive packaging process is complex and expensive. Limited by processing technology, under microscopy, the surface of silica diaphragms, capillaries and welding points is always distributed with defects and micro-cracks of different depths [19]. Additionally, in oil and gas wells, silica capillary in direct contact with corrosive fluids reacts with well fluids [20], which changes its structure, because silica reacts with water molecules producing silica alcohols and hydroxyl groups, which breaks chemical bonds of SiO2 [21] and the stress can make the micro-cracks bigger and deeper, forming stress corrosion and affecting the performance of the sensor. Therefore, investigations of measured fluids isolation and pressure conduction techniques are also essential. In this paper, an F–P cavity probe consisting of silica capillary and single-mode optical fiber was formed by oxy-hydrogen flame welding, and the F–P cavity was fully sealed without adhesives. A spiral tube filled with silicone oil was used to prevent the probe from contacting and interacting with down-hole corrosion fluid directly and to transfer pressure. A fiber Bragg grating was connected next to the F–P​ cavity probe for ambient temperature measurement to compensate for the influence of temperature on the F–P cavity probe. Compared with other pressure sensors, the F–P cavity sensors here can bear pressure high up to 82 MPa and temperature to 175 °C, have excellent stability and good repeatability, and are especially suitable for pressure monitoring in petroleum field and other harsh environment applications. Compared with the fabrication technology previously researched, the fabrication process with oxy-hydrogen flame welding is simple, environment-friendly and inexpensive."
1,Fabrication of fiber optic F–P cavity pressure probe,
2,Working principle of the sensor,"2.1 Working principle of the sensor The fiber optic F–P cavity pressure probe based on F–P interferometer here mainly consists of three parts: a lead-in fiber, a reflective fiber and a collimation tube(silica capillary), as is shown in Fig. 1. The two parallel end faces of the lead-in and reflective fiber form an extrinsic fiber optic F–P cavity inside the collimation tube. When a bunch of monochromatic light (wavelength λ , intensity I 0 ) is transmitted to the fiber F–P cavity, the incident beam will be reflected several times between the two parallel ends of the fibers, which produces interference effect [22], the final reflection light intensity is given as (1) I R = r 1 2 + r 2 2 + 2 r 1 r 2 cos δ 1 + 2 r 1 r 2 cos δ + r 1 2 r 2 2 I 0 Where δ = 4 π n d λ is the phase difference, n is refractive index, r 1 = r 2 = 0 .2 [23], are the reflectivity of lead-in fiber and reflective fiber, respectively, and d is the length of the F–P​ cavity. When applied with pressure the silica capillary is squeezed to produce deformation, which causes the change of the F–P cavity length d. The change of d will cause variation of the reflective spectrum, and the surrounding pressure can be achieved by demodulating spectrum changes. As shown in Fig. 1, the inner and outer diameters of the silica capillary are r i and r o , in this paper, r i = 0 . 127 mm and r o = 0 . 3 mm, and the F–P​ cavity length change Δ d P caused by the external application pressure P is [20]: (2) Δ d P = L g r o 2 E r o 2 − r i 2 ( 1 − 2 μ ) P Where μ and E are the Poisson’s ratio and the Young’s modulus of the capillary, thus the external pressure can be calculated by measuring the cavity length variation. Besides, seen from formula (2) that the pressure sensor sensitivity can be adjusted by varying the F–P cavity geometric parameters, such as inner diameter r i , outer diameter r o and gauge L g . Practically, pressure and temperature changes are generated simultaneously, and both of them can cause the cavity length to change. The F–P cavity length change can be expressed as (3) Δ d = Δ d T + Δ d P Where, Δ d is the total change of F–P cavity length, Δ d T and Δ d P are the changes of cavity length caused by temperature and pressure change. To improve the accuracy of pressure measurement, Δ d T should be minimized."
3,Oxy-hydrogen flame welding system and fabrication progress of the sensor probe,"2.2 Oxy-hydrogen flame welding system and fabrication progress of the sensor probe The fabrication system of fiber optic F–P cavity pressure probe based on oxy-hydrogen flame welding is shown in Fig. 2. Oxy-hydrogen flame is targeted at specified position of the silica capillary, and the silica capillary and some fiber claddings are melted at high temperature, and then the capillary and the fiber are solidified and connected with each other when the flame is removed. An adjustable clamp including a compression nut and a sealing gasket fixes the optical fiber and the capillary flexibly together, the pipe shaft is rigidly connected to the adjustable clamp to place the pigtail of the fibers, and a rotating fixture clamps the pipe shaft. A control drive system drives the entire clamp to rotate. Simultaneous rotation at full angle and high coaxiality while hot fusion welding is performed makes the capillary wall and optical fiber cladding be heated uniformly and form a uniform ring-shaped fusion joint. A vacuumizing device vacuums the silica capillary, and the annulus pressure in the tube wall P 1 is less than the pressure outside the tube P 2 , forming a pressure difference, which makes it easier to form a dense fusion junction. The same CTE of the silica capillary and the fiber avoids the occurrence of thermal mismatch and thermal stress, which is a packaging technique without additional material. As is shown in Fig. 3, the F–P cavity fabrication process can be divided into 6 steps: (a) cutting a certain length of silica capillary with a cutter, and one end of the capillary was melt and blocked by oxy-hydrogen flame (b) welding capillary and the lead-in fiber to form the first heating fusion point, in this step, a common lead-in single-mode fiber (SMF) was connected to a SM125 (Optical Sensing Interrogator, Micron Optics Inc.) to monitor the spectrum in real time during cutting the fiber to form a flat surface and inserting into the capillary. Followingly, the capillary and the optical fiber are put into the oxy-hydrogen flame welding system to form the first heating fusion point. (c) F–P cavity fabrication, cutting off the blockage point with a cutter, and then another naked fiber with a flat surface was inserted into the other side of the capillary to function as the reflective fiber with the SM125 demodulating the cavity length timely. When the cavity length d reached about 120 μ m , the reflective fiber was bonded with the capillary by epoxy glue. (d) fixing the reflective fiber of an F–P cavity, the capillary and the optical fiber are transferred into the oxy-hydrogen flame welding system to form the second heating fusion point. (e) cutting the capillary for adhesive-free sealing. (f) F–P cavity probe adhesive-free sealing by oxy-hydrogen flame. Finally, Fig. 4 gives the microscope image (a) and the practicality picture (b) of an integral F–P cavity, respectively."
4,Design of sensor package structure,"As shown in Fig. 5, a spiral tube was welded on protective body 2 by laser and filled with protective fluids—silicone oil, which was used to prevent corrosive fluids from interacting with sensor probe and conduct the measured pressure by vacuuming. The internal diameter of the spring tube used in this article is 1 mm, the density of the silicone oil used is low and the surface tension is large, which is very easy to produce “capillary effect”, which made the silicone oil maintain a certain shape like a solid to prevent silicone oil from diffusing out of the spiral tube, and the spiral structure increases the volume of the injected silicone oil. The measured fluids entered along the feed hole of protective body 1 to compress silicone oil. Sensor probe and metal base are fixed and sealed with low temperature glass solder, and metal base and protective body 2 are sealed by metal deformation. The optical fiber passing through protective body 3 is protected by steel tube and sealed by low-temperature glass solder, and the steel tube is sealed by metal ferrule. Protective bodies 1, 2 and 3 made of stainless steel were sealed by metal sealing ring. An FBG is cascaded with the F–P cavity in series to monitor temperature. One end of FBG was used as the lead-in fiber of the F–P cavity. The variation of the F–P cavity length can be amended with the temperature coefficient of cavity length with temperature which can be measured previously in laboratory, meanwhile, the temperature can be sensed real-time by FBG. The demodulation process was optimized to minus the temperature and pressure cross-sensitivity of the F–P cavity pressure sensor. After cascaded with a FBG, the reflective spectrum of the fiber optic F–P cavity and FBG is shown in Fig. 6, and the practicality picture of this kind of F–P cavity pressure sensor is shown in Fig. 7. "
5,Experiment results and discussion,"The characteristic test system of the fiber optic F–P cavity pressure sensor is illustrated in Fig. 8, and the system mainly includes a piston pressure pump (GE3100 whose pressure range and accuracy are 0 ∼ 110 MPa and 0.08% F ⋅ S, GE Co.), a thermostatic oil tank (NDJ-0J whose temperature range and fluctuation are room temperature to 200 °C and ± 0.01 °C, respectively, Jiangsuhengnuo Co., Ltd), a signal demodulator SM125, and so on. The fiber sensor together with a platinum resistance thermometer (1502 A whose accuracy is ± 0.01 °C, Fluke Co.) were inserted into a thermostatic oil tank, and the pressure was exerted on the sensor by a piston pressure pump through the pressurized hole and the pressure pipe (The maximum internal pressure is 150 MPa, Shanghai Dayton Electrical and Mechanical Technology Co., Ltd.). The optical signal propagated from the light source of SM125 into the FBG and F–P​ cavity of the sensor along the optical fiber, and then the reflective and interference spectrum created by FBG and F–P cavity, respectively, propagated back into SM125. The output signal was processed through multi-peak demodulation algorithm to demodulate the variation of F–P cavity length and the SM125 built-in algorithm to read the wavelength of FBG directly. The response of the F–P cavity length and the FBG wavelength versus temperature and the F–P​ cavity length change after being compensated were diagrammatically represented in Fig. 9. With rising of temperature, the wavelength of the FBG increased in a quadratic trend [24] and the curve can be fitted as follows: λ = 0 .000012 T 2 +0.009037T + 1525.9001 and the quadratic correlation coefficient is 0.99999, and the F–P cavity length increased linearly and the curve can be fitted as follows: d = 0 .5008T + 116969 and the linear correlation coefficient is 0.9998. After fitting, the surrounding temperature can be calculated and Δ d T in formula (3) can be removed, and the change of the compensated cavity length is less than 1 nm as the temperature rises from 15 °C to 175 °C. Besides, the sensor can withstand a temperature of up to 175 °C. As shown by equal (2), at a certain temperature, the F–P cavity length will be linearly changed with ambient pressure and Fig. 10 verifies this. For silica: E = 74 GPa , μ = 0 . 17 , and L g , r i and r o are 23 mm, 0.3 mm and 0.127 mm, respectively. When the surrounding temperatures are set at room temperature, the fitting curve of the F–P cavity length response to pressure is: d=-240.71P+116987.24, and the correlation coefficient is 0.999999. The maximum external pressure of the fiber optic sensor was up to 82 MPa, and the sensitivity was 241 nm/MPa. The resolution of the sensor refers to the ability to be measured with minimal variation, and it is defined as Δ P min ∕ P max [13], where, Δ P min is the minimum change in pressure and P max is the maximum range of the sensor. To calculate the resolution of a sensor, it is necessary to find the minimum pressure change that can be detected by the sensor. The minimum pressure change that can be measured Δ P min is related to the measurable disturbance Δ d min which is determined by the resolution of the demodulation instrument and demodulation algorithm: (4) Δ P min = d P d d Δ d min Wavelength resolution of SM125 is 1 pm, combined with multi-peak demodulation algorithm, the demodulation resolution of F–P cavity length can reach 0.1 nm. According to equals (2) and (4), the calculated pressure resolution is 0.0004 MPa. Fig. 11 gives the experimental results of the cavity length variation without pressure at room temperature, and the standard deviation (SD) is approximately 0.05 nm. If the two times of SD was employed as the resolution of the cavity length, it is 0.1 nm which is the same as theoretical calculation, and the pressure resolution is about 0.0004MPa. The F–P cavity length responses to the ambient pressure were recorded for both pressure upward and downward and Fig. 12 shows the typical upward and downward cavity length deviations from the average length in the range of 0–82 MPa at the temperature of 120 °C at different days. Obviously, the F–P cavity length was relatively stable at different days and the change is less than 4.9 nm. If the two times of cavity length deviations from the average length was employed as the repeatability of the cavity length, it is 9.8 nm, converting into pressure, it is 0.04 MPa. That means the repeatability of the F–P cavity pressure sensor can reach 0.05% F.S. (full scale). Long-term stability is defined as the ability of the sensor to maintain its performance parameters over a long period time. Keep the F–P cavity pressure sensor at constant pressure and temperature of 42 MPa and 130 °C, respectively, and record the F–P cavity length for 40 days. Fig. 13 shows that the change of the cavity length in this paper is only 1.6 nm in 40 days and it is about 0.0072 MPa in pressure. "
6,Practical use of the fiber sensor in Shengli Oil Field,"A typical fiber optic F–P cavity pressure sensor was practically used in an oil well of Shengli Oil Field which is 3500 m in depth. The measuring profile shown in Fig. 14 can be divided into two processes: sending-down and lifting-up. The sending-down process is further divided into 0–950 m with a speed of 50 m/min, 950–1050 m with a speed of 6 m/min, 1050–1950 m with a speed of 50 m/min, 1950–2050 m with a speed of 6 m/min, 2050–2930 m with a speed of 50 m/min, and 2930–3050 m with a speed of 6 m/min. The lifting-up process is further divided into 3050–2930 m with a speed of 6 m/min, 2930–2050 m with a speed of 50 m/min, 2050–1950 m with a speed of 6 m/min, and 1950–0 m with a speed of 50 m/min. The pressure and temperature at the bottom of the oil well acquired through the fiber optic sensor were 26.79 MPa and 136.2 °C, respectively, and the measured temperature and pressure of the two processes have a good consistency. In 2930–3050 m of sending-down procedure, an electronic pressure sensor is aligned with the F–P cavity pressure sensor, and the result is shown in Fig. 15. The maximum pressure difference between the electronic pressure sensor and the F–P cavity pressure sensor is less than 0.03 MPa, and the maximum pressure difference between sending-down and lifting-up progresses of the F–P pressure sensor is less than 0.04 MPa. The data manifest that this kind of fiber optic sensor show preferable performance and have wide application prospects. "
7,Conclusion,"A fiber optic F–P cavity high pressure sensor used in oil wells is presented. An F–P cavity probe was formed by a silica capillary and two single-mode optical fibers functioning as lead-in and reflection fibers through oxy-hydrogen flame welding, and the F–P cavity was fully sealed. A spiral tube filled with silicone oil is aimed at preventing the probe from contacting with down-hole corrosion fluid directly and transferring pressure. An FBG was cascaded with the F–P cavity probe to measure ambient temperature to compensate for the F–P cavity’s temperature response.

Further, the sensor can be much stable with a maximum F–P cavity length fluctuation of only 1.6 nm for more than 40 days at the pressure and temperature of 42 MPa and 130 °C, respectively. This kind of sensor has been used in Shengli Oil Field, an electronic pressure sensor was aligned with the sensor for comparison. the maximum difference between the electronic pressure sensor and the F–P cavity pressure sensor is less than 0.03 MPa, and that of the fiber optic sensor between sending-down and lifting-up progresses is less than 0.04 MPa. This kind of F–P cavity pressure sensor is especially suitable for down-hole measurement and other harsh environment applications."
