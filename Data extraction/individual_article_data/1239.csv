0,Introduction,"Microwave-assisted pyrolysis is being considered as an attractive technology to produce biofuels from biomass residues and waste feedstock [1,2]. Due to its unique heating features, the microwave-heated pyrolysis process has been investigated for the ability to deliver improved quality syngas [3,4], oil [5,6] and char [7,8], compared to conventional pyrolysis under various process conditions. Most studies reported that the dominance of microwave processes over conventional are based on laboratory scale processes [9–11]. As a result, potential for commercialization of microwave-assisted process may be levelled off if studies are conducted in a scaled-up reactor. Compared to combustion and gasification, pyrolysis processes generate tri-state products (i.e., char, oil and syngas) from biomass feedstock at elevated temperatures with the absence of oxidant. These products can be used for many high value applications [12–14]. Utilization flexibility and economic value favour the overall system efficiency due to product diversification. Implementing pyrolysis processes is therefore regarded as an attractive method to increase the share of bio-energy in energy generation systems. In recent studies, biomass pyrolytic polygeneration of gas, solid char and liquid oil has been investigated and found to be a promising biomass conversion technology [13,14]. These studies used various biomass feedstocks (such as poplar, bamboo, and cotton stalk) in different types of electrically heated reactors, such as laboratory scale reactors [13–15], retort reactors [16], and bench scale reactors [12,17]. However, to the best of our knowledge, biomass pyrolytic polygeneration systems using microwave radiation as a heating source have not been reported. Recent work based on a laboratory-scale pyrolyser demonstrated that improved performance can be achieved in a microwave-assisted process compared to the conventional one [11]. Despite having many advantages compared to conventional heated processes, the growth of industrial microwave applications is still limited due to the challenges in industrial scale operation [1,10]. Hence, systematic study of polygeneration of solid char, liquid oil, and biogas in a scaled-up reactor via microwave-assisted biomass pyrolysis is an important step in comparing microwave-heated biofuel production processes with other existing commercially available processes. Exergy analysis has been considered an efficient tool for understanding and improving industrial processes [18,19]. This method can reveal the source of existing inefficiencies and potential areas for improvement within the system. Hence, over the past decade, many researchers have conducted exergetic evaluations of different biomass thermochemical routes [20,21]. However, exergetic evaluations of biomass pyrolysis systems have not been extensively studied so far [22,23]. Existing research concentrated on stand-alone pyrolysis systems under both high temperature (800–1200 °C) [23] and low temperature (500 °C) [22] conditions. Exergetic analysis of a pyrolysis unit as a part of the gasification process [24] was also conducted previously, along with a simulation study of an oil production system based on fast pyrolysis [25]. Recently, a laboratory-scale gumwood pyrolysis process, heated with both conventional and microwave energy was examined with an exergy tool [11]. The results demonstrated that overall pyrolysis system efficiency and exergetic efficiency can be significantly enhanced by using microwave power as a heating source. In spite of having the benefits of the application of microwave power over electrical heating in lab-scale biomass pyrolysis, its performance in a scaled-up pyrolysis reactor needs to be comprehensively investigated for commercial scale operation. Moreover, literature focusing on microwave-assisted pyrolysis processes in large reactors (kilogram load feedstock) is scarce. Therefore, to assess the feasibility of microwave-assisted method in industrial applications, it is essential to conduct further investigation in scaled-up reactors using different types of biomass, using exergy analysis tools as a performance indicator. Hydrogen is a clean fuel that is frequently used in the chemical industry as an important feedstock [26]. The production of hydrogen from fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal causes significant CO2 emissions. Thus, hydrogen from renewable biomass as an alternative to widely used feedstock has caught increasing interest over recent years. Pyrolysis is considered a promising method to produce bio-hydrogen, due to low-temperature operation and product diversification [26]. However, inefficiency associated with low biomass energy density is still a big challenge that needs to be solved to compete with conventional fuel sources. In recent years, syngas derived from biomass has been regarded as a competitive source for hydrogen production, since bio-syngas is a clean feedstock [27]. Moreover, the benefits of using microwave energy over conventional (electrically-heated) methods with regards to improved bio-syngas quality was also reported recently [11]. Although use of microwave technology in laboratory-scale pyrolysis reactors for hydrogen production has been briefly reported, a comprehensive investigation using different types of biomass in scaled-up reactor en route to commercial scale production has yet to be explored. In this work, corn stalk, pinewood and algae biomasses were used as the feedstocks for a pyrolytic polygeneration system using a scaled-up microwave-heated reactor at 400, 500 and 600 °C. The products were characterized by various analytical techniques and the results were compared to speculate on potential applications. Afterwards, the system based on these biomasses were compared with respect to energy and exergy efficiencies. Finally, an Aspen Plus™ simulation of bio-hydrogen production using these three biomass samples was conducted separately and compared in this study."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Three different types of biomass, namely corn stalk, pinewood, and algae, were used as the feedstocks in this study. Corn stalk (CS) was selected as the feedstock since it is Canada's third largest grain crop and is the most important one in eastern Canada. A marine biomass algae (chlorella) was chosen due to its high potential for biofuel production. It is known to be a third-generation bioenergy feedstock, able to replace conventional arable crops, forest and agricultural wastes. Moreover, in order to compare corn stalk and algae with other types of commonly used biomass feedstock (such as forestry biomass), pinewood (PW) was picked as the third raw material. The samples were chopped, shredded, and then dried in an oven at 105 °C for 24 h. The sampling was performed following the standard method to ensure the representativeness of the samples [28,29]. The sample size used for the pyrolysis experiment at scale-up reactor was in the range of 2–3 cm. All samples were ground to a size smaller than 106 μm (Endecotts aperture sieve) following the standard milling procedure for characterization purposes. The size reduction was carried out by using a laboratory mill (Thomas Model 4 Wiley, Arthur H. Thomas Company, USA). Proximate analysis of the raw and pyrolysed char samples was carried out by a TGA (Q500, TA Instruments, USA) adopting the methodology stated for coal described elsewhere [30]. The analysis of C, H, N and S was conducted using an Elemental Analyser (Thermo Fischer Scientific Flash 2000). The higher heating value (HHV) was calculated by an Automatic Isoperibol Calorimeter (Parr Instrument Co., Model 6300) following ASTM Standard Method D5865. The basic properties (e.g. proximate analysis, ultimate analysis and HHV data) of the investigated samples are listed in Table 1 . It is noticeable that pinewood had a lower ash content compared to the other two biomasses. It has been widely reported that biomass samples contained high amounts of alkali and alkaline earth materials (AAEMs) [31]. Therefore, high ash content in biomass implies more AAEM content, which would affect the properties of pyrolysis products."
3,Experimental set-up,"2.2 Experimental set-up Fig. 1 shows experimental arrangement of the scaled-up pyrolysis reactor system under microwave-assisted heating and Fig. 2 illustrates its schematic diagram [32]. The microwave-assisted pyrolysis experiments of different biomass feedstocks were conducted in a custom-built cylindrical stainless steel reactor connected to a 3 kW and 2450 MHz frequency microwave generator system (Muegge GmbH, Germany). Two K-type thermocouples were employed for temperature measurement since this type is suitable for harsh microwave environment. The thermocouples were placed inside the thermowell and connected to the computer via 8 channel Pico data logger. It is useful to note that the thermowells are closed from the bottom. The required pyrolysis temperature was reached by varying the microwave power. To maintain temperatures of 400, 500 and 600 °C, average microwave powers used were 2100, 2400 and 2700 Watt, respectively. In each test, three runs were conducted and average value was taken. A N2 flow rate (4.5 l/min) of 97.5% purity (CA26000-014 VWR INC., Canada) was maintained in order to achieve an O2-free condition. The reflected power from the microwave and the temperature data from thermocouples were continuously monitored in a real time using respective softwares. The pyrolytic vapour was continuously swept out from the reactor by N2 and condensed in a glass condenser (6016–141, VWR Inc., Canada). In each test, 1 kg of air-dried sample was used in the reactor as feed. Here, about 10% of biochar was mixed with feed sample, since biochar is a good microwave absorber. The experiments were carried out at three different temperatures (400, 500 and 600 °C). Once the sample's temperature reached the target (pre-set) temperature, the reactor was kept isothermal for another 45 min to ensure complete pyrolysis. After pyrolysis, the resulting char was rapidly cooled down to room temperature under N2 purge and stored in desiccator to prevent moisture absorption. The bio-oil was obtained from the condenser while a sampling bag was employed for the collection of gaseous products. The yields of solid and liquid products were weighed while the gaseous fraction was determined by the difference on the basis of mass balance. Each test was conducted at least three times to keep the experimental error less than 3%."
4,Product characterization,"2.3 Product characterization The main organic components (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulphur) of biochar were determined using a CHNS/O Elemental Analyser (Thermo Fischer Scientific Flash 2000) following the standard testing procedure [33]. The HHV of biochar was calculated by an Automatic Isoperibol Calorimeter (Parr Instrument Co., Model 6300) following ASTM Standard Method D5865. The composition of the gas product was analysed by a GC (Shimadzu GC-2014, Japan). The GC consists of 1 FID detector, 2 TCD detectors, 8 molecular columns and 1 HP-AL/s capillary column. The HHV was calculated with the procedures of using gas composition described elsewhere [34]. The main organic components of the bio-oil were measured using a Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS, Agilent 7890-5975C USA) equipped with a HP-5ms capillary column (30 m length, 0.25 mm internal diameter and 0.25 μm film thickness) following the method described elsewhere [11,35]. Each test in this study was performed at least three times to minimize the experimental error."
5,Energy and exergy analysis,"Fig. 3 illustrates the energy streams in and out of the pyrolysis system considered in a control volume. In the present work, there are two energy inputs that are considered: the energy in biomass, and the energy (such as electrical and microwave) required to supply heat for the reactor. Gas, char and oil are considered energy outputs from the biomass pyrolysis system. The total energy input and output of the system can be expressed as [19,23]: (1) E n B i o + E n M W = E n G a s + E n C h a r + E n O i l + E n L o s s where En Bio and En MW represent the energy rate of biomass and MW derived heat, respectively. Here, En Gas, En Char and En Oil denote energy rate in gas, char and oil, respectively. Meanwhile, the energy loss of the system is represented by En Loss. Two key parameters, energy recovery in the product and pyrolysis system efficiency (PSE), are taken into consideration for the assessment of the proposed system [19,22,23]. (2) Energy recovery = ∑ W P ⋅ L H V P W B i o ⋅ L H V B i o (3) Pyrolysis system efficiency ( PSE ) = E n e r g y o u t p u t E n e r g y i n p u t × 100 where, W P is the weight of individual pyrolysis product (kg), W Bio is the weight of input biomass (kg), LHV P is the LHV of individual pyrolysis products (MJ/kg) and LHV Bio is the LHV value of biomass (MJ/kg). Here, energy input refers to the energy in biomass and heat supplied to the pyrolyser, and energy output represents the sum of the energy contained in all pyrolysis products. The total energy in biomass, char and oil can be calculated using Eq. (4): (4) E n B i o = m B i o ⋅ H H V B i o where, mBio is the flow rate (kg/s) of biomass and HHVBio is the higher heating value (MJ/kg) of biomass. The evaluation of LHV from HHV can be performed using the following correlation: (5) H H V = L H V + 21.978 ⋅ H where, H denotes the mass fraction of hydrogen in biomass. The physical energy of pyrolytic gas is calculated as follows: (6) E n p h y = ∑ i n i h i where, n i is the mole number of gas component i; h i is the specific enthalpy (kJ/kmol) of gas component i. The chemical energy of pyrolytic gas is calculated as follows: (7) E n c h e = ∑ i n i H H V i where, HHVi is the higher heating value of gas component i. Physical exergy of pyrolysis gas can be calculated using the following equation: (8) E x p h y = n i ∑ i [ ( h − h o ) + T o ( s − s o ) ] The definition of chemical exergy of pyrolysis gas is expressed as: (9) E x c h e = n i ∑ i x ( e x i c h e + R T o l n γ i x i ) Biomass exergy is calculated by a statistical correlation. (10) E x B i o = β ⋅ m B i o ⋅ L H V B i o The exergy efficiency (Ψ system ) of the system can be defined as follows: (11) Ψ s y s t e m = E e x O u t E e x I n Details of energy and exergy-related correlations, HHVs, standard chemical exergy and other useful parameters for biomass and pyrolytic products have been well-defined in a number of studies [19,22,23,36]."
6,Bio-hydrogen production,"The block flow diagram of bio-hydrogen production using a scaled-up reactor is illustrated in Fig. 4 . As previously mentioned, microwave energy was supplied to convert biomass into tri-state products. The gaseous product (mixture of H2, CO, CO2, and CH4) was considered as feedstock for bio-hydrogen production. The solid char product was further combusted to generate heat, since char has a high carbon content. Meanwhile, the liquid product from the pyrolyser is collected as bio-oil and further considered for chemical processing units (such as phenol and acid production), since the conversion of this product to diesel is limited due to component diversification. Prior to H2 synthesis, a desulphurization unit (iron oxide-based) was installed since sulphur content (mostly H2S) remarkably reduces overall catalyst performance. Afterwards, the pyrolysis gas was sent to the hydrogen synthesis plant. The hydrogen synthesis plant had three major sections as seen in Fig. 4. The first section was the steam methane reforming (SMR) unit. Here, methane reacts with steam in the presence of catalyst to produce a gas mixture primarily containing hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide [37]. The SMR process is governed by the following reactions: (12) CH 4 + H 2 O ↔ CO + 3 H 2 206 MJ/kmol (13) CO + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + H 2 - 41 MJ/kmol Due to an endothermic nature, a high temperature region (630–1000 °C) is required for the SMR reaction (Eq. (12)) to attain equilibrium in the presence of Ni-based catalyst. The second section was the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction (Eq. (13)) unit. In this step, carbon monoxide and steam are reacted to produce carbon dioxide and more hydrogen [38]. Accordingly, the carbon monoxide content decreased while hydrogen content increased in the reactor. Thus, the WGS unit is regarded as a secondary hydrogen generator. It is worth noting that even though the WGS reaction can occur in the SMR unit, the WGS unit is employed for enhanced hydrogen production. Usually, two successive shift reactors, a high temperature reactor (HTS) and a low temperature reactor (LTS), are used for the completion of the shift reaction. The HTS operates from 350 to 500 °C with Fe–Cr-based catalyst whereas the LTS operates around 200 °C in the presence of Cu-based catalyst. The outlet gas stream from the WGS unit contained a high percentage of carbon dioxide and steam, with small portions of carbon monoxide, methane and nitrogen. Therefore, a hydrogen purification section was employed as a final process step. Here, carbon dioxide and other impurities were removed from the gas stream using various purification methods, such as pressure swing adsorption (PSA), Methyldiethanolamine (MDEA), and condensation processes [38]. Afterwards, the purified hydrogen product was collected at ambient temperature using a water-cooled heat exchanger. In this study, solid char product was fed into the combustor to produce energy. An operating temperature around 1200 °C was selected for the combustor and air was used as an oxidation agent. The energy taken from the combustor can be used for the pyrolyser and other units inside the system. Further, part of the recovered steam can be fed to a power plant for electricity production. The flow diagram shown in Fig. 4 is a preliminary process design for hydrogen synthesis that needs to be further optimized [37,39,40]. Essentially, the present work deals with the evaluation of bio-hydrogen production using different types of biomass in a scaled-up microwave-assisted pyrolysis reactor. In the present work, simulation of hydrogen production from microwave-assisted scaled-up reactor was performed using Aspen Plus™ software. The basic assumptions and methodologies of modelling and simulation can be found elsewhere [21,40–42]. It is important to highlight that the product characteristics derived from the pyrolysis process largely depend on the basic properties (such as physiochemical properties) of feedstock and heating parameters. These phenomena are attributed to the interactions between the available components at various process conditions. So far, limited studies have been conducted with respect to pyrolysis process modelling. The results revealed that there are high levels of uncertainty that exist in the biomass pyrolysis model under various operation conditions to predict the product yield and composition [43]. In the proposed Aspen Plus™ simulation study, a Yield module (RYield reactor) was used to model the fixed bed pyrolyser. This module produced char, oil, and gas from biomass feedstock. The flow rate of mass for each component was determined by using the specific yield distribution of scaled-up pyrolysis data. Hence, the results obtained through this simulation were more accurate and could be used for industrial scale hydrogen production. A Separator module (Sep block) was installed after the pyrolyser to obtain tri-state products. Afterwards, the gaseous products were directed to a SMR unit followed by a WGS unit for hydrogen synthesis. It should be highlighted that the reason to consider a SMR unit in the present work was the relatively high methane content (10–31 vol%) in the pyrolysis gas. The operation parameters of 850 °C, 20 atm, and S/C ratio of 3 were selected, and it was modelled with RGibbs module (RGibbs reactor) [44]. Afterwards, the WGS reaction takes place in two consecutive reactors, a HTS at 375 °C followed by a LTS at 200 °C [37,38]. The modelling of the WGS unit was carried out using the Aspen REquil module (REquil reactor). Finally, pure hydrogen is produced through various purification steps. Practically, these purification processes (such as PSA) are a complex model on their own, which requires simplification to achieve a complete design representation and performance. Therefore, an Aspen Plus component separation module (Sep block) was adopted to build simpler separation processes, denoting the purification steps, with the main aim to produce H2. A Gibbs reactor (RGibbs) was used to model the combustion of char generated from the pyrolyser unit, whereas the separation of ash from gases that also took place in a combustor was modelled by using a cyclone (Sep block). Here, around 50 bar of steam was generated by converting (via heat exchanger) the heat residue from the combustion process."
7,Results and discussions,
8,Product yield distribution,"5.1 Product yield distribution The yield distributions of the products (char, gas and oil) from the three biomass samples pyrolysed at 400, 500 and 600 °C under microwave-assisted heating with a scaled-up reactor are shown in Table 2 . Overall, the yield of gas increased with the increasing of pyrolytic temperature. In addition, the gas yield was found to be the largest among the three products in the investigated temperature range. For corn stalk, the gas yield increased from 45.2 wt% to 63.9 wt% as the temperature rose from 400 °C to 600 °C. The primary degradation of corn stalk biomass and the secondary cracking of the volatiles at elevated temperatures were the most important reasons for this phenomena [45]. Pyrolytic gas has high product value in polygeneration process since it can be utilized for fuel and heat generation. Hence, pyrolytic gaseous products with high yield and improved quality have huge demand in industrial and municipal applications. It is important to note that pyrolysis processes need to be operated at considerably high temperatures to produce high quality gas. Consequently, the total cost of the system will increase due to high energy demand. Char has been regarded as the most important product in pyrolytic polygeneration systems since it can significantly improve the overall profitability of the system. It can be seen from Table 2 that an increase in pyrolysis temperature led to a decrease in the production of char (36.4 wt% to 24.8 wt%) and oil (18.4 wt% to 11.3 wt%) fractions. This was because the high temperature favours heterogeneous reactions between the gases and char, and secondary cracking of oil vapours (components including acids, furan, ketones and esters) into incondensable gas products. The results signified that although high temperature could promote the gas yield, the valuable composition in liquid oil might be diminished. The abovementioned trend agrees with previous works and can be interpreted with proper explanation detailed in other studies [4,13,15,32,46]. As for pinewood (PW) and algae, a similar result was noticed as the temperature was raised from 400 to 600 °C, as seen in Table 2. However, within the temperature range studied, algae produced more gas (15–25 wt%) than other samples, indicating the viability of algae as a potential feedstock for synthetic fuel production. On the other hand, corn stalk (CS) generated a higher amount of char (10–20 wt%) than the other samples. Accordingly, char derived from corn stalk might also be a good source of solid fuel."
9,Products characteristics,"5.2 Products characteristics The compositions of major gaseous product at three different pyrolytic temperatures with a scaled-up reactor are listed in Table 3 . The generation of gaseous components is the result of several phenomena and reactions occurring simultaneously during the pyrolysis process. These include the cracking and degradation of char as well as homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions between components formed during pyrolysis [12,47]. It is important to note that inorganic compounds, such as K2O, Na2O and CaO, are vastly available in biomass species, and may play a catalytic role in tar cracking, increasing the gas yield. Table 3 shows that H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 were the main components of the gaseous product. Given the same temperature range, high temperature overall offered higher proportions of gaseous outputs, i.e. syngas (H2+CO) and H2. As for H2, the concentration increased with temperature, since a high temperature favours secondary cracking of hydrocarbons and cracking of CH4, which form substantial amounts of H2 in the system [47,48]. Furthermore, the volume of CH4 increased with temperature mostly due to the decomposition of methoxyl groups. The formation of CH4 could also be enhanced by the breaking of methylene groups and aromatic rings available in the system. At low temperatures (400 °C), the concentration of CO and CO2 were found to be high, as seen in Table 3. Intense deoxygenation reactions in the pyrolysis process are attributed to this phenomenon. Afterwards, the concentration of CO2 gradually decreased with temperature, which might be caused by the initiation of the reverse Boudouard reaction (2CO ↔ CO2 + C). Hydrocarbons such as C2H6, C4H6 and CmHn were also formed at low temperatures, and their volume decreased with temperature. At 400 °C, corn stalk produced higher amounts of CO2. Pinewood and algae followed a similar trend. This was due to the fact that CO2 is a major gas generated during the low-temperature decarboxylation of hemicellulose and cellulose found in biomass. Some researchers have reported similar results [14,49]. It is important to note that at each experimental temperature, corn stalk produced the lowest amount (40 vol%) of syngas (H2+CO) compared to the other two samples while the CO2 amount was determined to be highest (23–40 vol%), as seen in Table 3. As for syngas, next to the total amount produced, H2/CO ratio and CO2 percentage are the two key parameters that significantly affect its purification and application in fuel synthesis. It can be seen from Fig. 5 that regardless of feedstock type, syngas ratio increased while the CO2 fraction in syngas decreased with temperature. The increase in ratio of H2 to CO was mainly due to the increment in H2 in syngas while reduction of CO2 could be related to the Boudouard reaction and reverse WGS reaction. Eventually, high H2/CO ratio and low CO2 content in syngas were found at high temperature from the pyrolysis process. It is interesting to note that among three samples, syngas derived from algae had the highest syngas ratio (1.6) and the lowest CO2 percentage (12 vol%). Moreover, gas yield from algae was the greatest, which might be attributed to its high carbohydrate content, favouring the formation of PAHs and small gas molecules under high temperatures. Thus, algae was revealed to be the best feedstock for synthetic fuel production. Calorific value is one of the key properties of gaseous product that significantly influences the overall performance of the polygeneration system. Therefore, the LHV of pyrolytic gas derived from three biomass samples at different temperatures was calculated and presented in Table 3. The LHV value of gas increased with increasing pyrolytic temperature. This increment was mostly attributed to the higher amount of CH4 and H2, which dictate the calorific value of syngas. It is interesting to highlight that within the investigated temperature range, the LHV of gas from three biomass samples ranged from 10 MJ Nm−3 to 18 MJ Nm−3. This range was higher than the value required (>7 MJ Nm−3) for fuel gas in urban resident application [16]. Hence, the quality of the gases derived from microwave-assisted pyrolysis process were acceptable. Moreover, the LHVs of gas products attained from this study were considerably greater compared with the LHVs of gases (9.5–13.2 MJ Nm−3) obtained from coal-water-slurry and pulverized-coal based gasification processes [34]. The volume fraction of CH4 ranged from 18 to 31%, which is lower than the requirement of marsh gas (65%) and natural gas (85%) [12,13]. Hence, conversion of H2 and CO to CH4 along with the reduction of CO2 fraction would be an attractive option to improve the heating value of the pyrolytic gas. The elemental composition, heating value, BET surface area and combustion parameters of the pyrolysed biochar samples in a scaled-up reactor are presented in Table 4 . With respect to ultimate analysis data, it can be seen that the carbon percentage of pyrolysed chars increased from 62.9 wt%-69.1 wt% to 67.5 wt%-77.3 wt%, within the investigated pyrolysis temperature (400–600 °C), while the hydrogen percentage decreased gradually and the oxygen content showed similar behaviour (from 22.8 to 34.4 wt% to 16.3–29.1 wt%). These findings indicated that the carbonization of char was greatly increased with pyrolysis temperature [14,15]. From Table 4, it can be seen that at 600 °C, the carbon content of pinewood char reached nearly 80%, one of the requirements for use as a solid fuel [13]. Compared to corn stalk and algae samples, the HHV value of the pinewood char was revealed to be the highest, and reached 27.3 MJ kg−1, mainly due to the increment of carbon content and the decrement of oxygen content. BET surface area, an important indicator for solid fuel reactivity, was measured for all the studied samples. Usually, char with a larger BET specific surface area is of higher reactivity. It was found that BET surface area was the highest for pinewood, indicating high reactivity during combustion/gasification [50,51]. The aforementioned results showed biochar obtained from pinewood was suitable for application as solid fuel. Table 5 shows the major bio-oil compounds formed at different pyrolysis temperatures under microwave heating. The main organic matters were divided into phenols, ketones, furan, acids, ester, naphthalene, aromatic hydrocarbon and nitrogenated compounds. It is clear that the pyrolysis temperature had a notable effect on the composition and yield of liquid products. For corn stalk, at 400 °C, the bio-oil was rich in phenols, acids, ketones and esters. The yield of phenol increased with temperature due to enhanced decomposition of lignin, and secondary reactions that triggered the breaking of many strong bonds between the aromatics rings [14,15]. Contrarily, the acids, which were major components at low temperature, declined due to the secondary degradation. Furthermore, a gradual decrement of ketones and furans yields was noticed in this temperature range due to the release of organic compounds. With regard to phenols content, pinewood exhibited a similar trend as corn stalk as seen in Table 5. Beside phenols, ester, alkene, and benzenes were the main components in pinewood bio-oil. Three compounds, phenols, naphthalene, and nitrogenated compounds were the dominant compounds in bio-oil produced from algae. The increment of naphthalene compound with temperature was mostly caused by the promotion of the dehydrogenation reaction. A high fraction of protein present in the algae caused the large amount of nitrogenated compounds in the bio-oil, while the large amount of naphthalene compounds were mostly produced due to high content of carbohydrates in the algae. The yield of nitrogenated compounds was slightly decreased with temperature as seen in Table 5. It is worth mentioning that the bio-oil processing is largely affected by the level of phenol and oxygen contents in the system."
10,Energy and exergetic analyses,"5.3 Energy and exergetic analyses Fig. 6 presents the energy recovery and energy conversion efficiency of corn stalk, pinewood and algae based systems conducted at 400, 500 and 600 °C. The energy conversion profile of the pyrolysis process was evaluated by the ratio of sum of the LHV of pyrolytic products to the LHV of biomass feedstock (detailed in section 3). The LHV indicates the potential of biomass conversion into useful products via pyrolysis. Overall, pyrolytic energy recovery of various biomass feedstocks increased with temperature as seen in Fig. 6. The increased energy recovery was due to the fact that gas yield (Table 2) and its corresponding LHV (Table 3) increased with temperature. This trend showed that a high pyrolysis temperature favoured the energy recovery from biomass. The energy recovery ranged between 0.63 and 1.0, which demonstrated that the energy contained in total pyrolytic products reached more than that of biomass feedstock. Next to pyrolysis temperature, feedstock types also influenced the energy recovery as seen in Fig. 6. At low and high temperatures, the energy recovery from corn stalk was the highest and an increasing linear relationship was noticed over the entire studied range. The increasing relationship was mostly caused by the higher yield of char (around 24–36 wt%) in corn stalk product compared to those generated from other samples at each temperature. For algae, energy recovery was found to be the lowest among the three samples at 400 °C due to low char content. It is interesting to note that despite algae having the highest gas fraction at 400 °C, its energy recovery was determined to be the lowest. The low energy recovery was due to the fact that LHV (12 MJ Nm−3) of gas was lower than that LHV (18.6 MJ kg−1) of char. Consequently, reduction of energy recovery due to low char yield could not be totally compensated by high gas content. However, a steady increment was noticed at higher temperature and energy recovery overtook pinewood feedstock due to the increment of gas fraction (73.5 wt% and 78.5 wt% at 500 °C and 600 °C, respectively) and corresponding LHV value (13.3 MJ Nm−3 and 14.4 MJ Nm−3 at 500 °C and 600 °C, respectively). However, the energy recovery parameter does not account for the energy requirement and can be misleading for overall efficiency evaluation since heat is a vital energy input in pyrolysis process. Thus, pyrolysis system energy efficiency (PSE), the overall performance indicator, was also calculated in the current study. PSE considers both total energy input required and energy output, hence, it comprehensively assess pyrolysis system. The effect of temperature on the PSE of the investigated systems is presented in Table 6 . Regardless of feedstock type, at each pyrolysis temperature, the PSE was lower than that of energy recovery since heat requirement to the system is considered in PSE evaluation. The values were in the ranges of 48.7%–63.6% within the temperature range considered in this study. The PSE increased with the rise of temperature because of the substantial augmentation of pyrolysis gas yield although char and oil yields experienced a steady decline. With the rise of temperature, unreacted carbon converts to gas, therefore, pyrolysis gas yield increases. Moreover, energy values of gas also increased with temperature. The energy efficiency was enhanced overall, since the increment rates of the gas sufficiently compensated for the high demand of energy and heat generation, as higher temperatures were used in the study. As seen in Fig. 6 and Table 6, unlike energy recovery, PSE of algae at 400 °C was the highest. The reason behind the highest value can be described in the following. It is important to note that LHV of gas was used in the energy recovery calculation (Eq. (1)). The total energy of syngas was calculated based on chemical composition (chemical energy) and physical state (physical energy). The total energy determined for algae at 400 °C was found to be the highest, mostly due to high energy content in syngas that can be attributed to high H2 and CH4 content (HHV of H2 and CH4 are 285,840 and 890,360 kJ kmol−1, respectively). Moreover, the gas yield and total percentage of combustible gas (H2, CO and CH4) in algae were 15% and 17% higher, respectively, than those of corn stalk. On the other hand, the PSE of corn stalk was revealed to be the highest at 600 °C. High char yield (25 wt%) and a relatively high LHV value (22 MJ kg−1) of char were the main reasons for this trend. For algae, the value of char yield and LHV were 10 wt% and 21 MJ kg−1, respectively. Although the gas yield (78 wt%) and corresponding energy content in algae-derived pyrolytic gas (15 MJ Nm−3) were considerably higher than those from corn stalk at 700 °C, the PSE of corn stalk was found to be higher than that of algae, mainly because of a 15% higher char yield. Here, the energy increment rate due to char was greater than the increment rate of gas. Table 6 also presents the exergetic efficiencies of three different biomass-based systems as a function of temperature. Compared to energy efficiency, exergy efficiency followed a similar trend. However, the exergy efficiency of each system was lower than its corresponding energy value as seen in Table 6. These results were attributed to the fact that exergy is regarded as the obtainable energy from a system. The significant difference between energy and exergy efficiency originates in sensible heat values associated with physical energy and exergy calculation [23]. For example, the sensible energy of N2 and CO2 decreased remarkably in exergy analysis. These aforementioned trends aligned well with the results presented by other researchers associated with the causes of the phenomenon [11,23]. It is interesting to note that unlike other feedstocks, the exergetic efficiency of the pinewood-based system decreased with temperature. The high reduction rate of char yield (8 wt% from 400 to 500 °C and 6 wt% from 500 to 600 °C) and relatively high HHV value (ranging from 23.2 to 27.3 MJ kg−1) of the corresponding char were the primary reasons for the trend. Accordingly, the increasing rate of gas exergy at high temperature was incapable of sufficiently compensating for the decrement of char and heat associated exergy, thus reducing the overall exergetic efficiency. When abstraction is made of efficiency related effects, it can be seen that apart from the feedstock, PSE and exergy efficiency were highly influenced by temperature. In general, efficiencies were enhanced at higher temperatures despite the high energy consumption, which were related to greater capital and operational expenditures. Thus, further optimization of investigated polygeneration processes is required since various factors, including system design and operation parameters, considerably affect the overall system performance. The findings within the present work offer first-hand knowledge about the energetic and exergetic assessment of microwave-assisted biomass polygeneration system based on a scaled-up reactor. The objective of the biomass-based polygeneration scaled-up system was to convert biomass feedstock into gaseous, solid and liquid products. As for gaseous products, H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 were the main components. Based on gas properties such as syngas ratio, product gas can be used for renewable H2 fuel production. Meanwhile, the solid product, commonly known as biochar, can be used as solid fuel for energy production. The effective utilization of bio-oil is still a challenging task, since converting to liquid fuel requires energy-intensive complex processes due to the diversity of bio-oil components. Hence, production of chemicals from bio-oil would be an attractive option. Overall, the significance of gaseous and char products promotes the development of biomass-based polygeneration technology. However, energy efficient bio-oil treatment routes need to be further developed to overcome the challenges of tackling huge volumes of oil."
11,Bio-hydrogen production,"5.4 Bio-hydrogen production Syngas derived from pyrolysis is used in the production of hydrogen. The amount of H2 produced is an important factor for evaluating the performance of the pyrolysis-based polygeneration process. There have been several studies that have demonstrated the superiority of microwave heating over electrical with respect to H2 production [3,11]. However, the present work focused on the production of H2 from various biomass feedstocks at different pyrolysis temperatures. The generation of heat is another key metric for determining the performance of the pyrolysis-based polygeneration process. Therefore, the effects of biomass feedstock and pyrolysis temperature on heat production was also investigated in the present work. As the pyrolysis of biomass produces multiple products, it is complicated to compare the results and products from the pyrolysis of the three feedstocks at various operating conditions. Therefore, the results need to be standardized by assigning the various feedstock inputs to the products. During Aspen Plus™ simulations, a biomass feedstock of 1000 kg h−1 was considered as the input, whereas H2 and heat were considered the two major products. With respect to heat recovery, the energy produced through the combustion of char was considered for evaluating the pyrolysis process. Table 7 summarizes the results for the amount of H2 and heat produced from the pyrolysis of three different biomass feedstocks (corn stalk, pinewood and algae) at three pyrolysis temperatures (400, 500 and 600 °C). For all three pyrolysis temperatures, the algae feedstock produced the highest amount of H2 (65.3–85.6 gH2/kg feedstock), while corn stalk always produced the lowest amount (40.3–64.5 gH2/kg feedstock). The high production of H2 is indicated by two main factors. Table 2 indicates that algae produces the highest weight percent (70.5–78.5 wt%) of gas and Table 3 indicates that algae also leads to the highest H2 vol% (25.4–34.5 vol%) in the produced gas. Consequently, the high gas yield leads to a lower char yield from the algae feedstock; the algae produced the lowest percentage of char at all temperatures (Table 2). This lowered char yield is the major reason why the algae pyrolysis had the lowest heat production at all temperatures (Table 7). The corn stock pyrolysis produced the highest percentage of char (36.4–24.8 wt%) (Table 2) and therefore has the highest heat production (4650-3170 MJ h−1) (Table 7). Another aspect that has been considered to relate to higher heat production is a higher carbon content [11]. As can be seen from Table 4, the pinewood biomass produced char with the highest carbon content and the corn stalk produced the lowest carbon content. By comparing the influence of char yield and carbon content, it can be seen that the overall char yield is more significant than the carbon content for improving the heat production. The use of pine feedstock produced H2 in amounts that were between that produced using algae and corn stalk. The highest amount of H2 produced from pinewood was 78.3 gH2 kg−1 feedstock, and occurred at a pyrolysis temperature of 600 °C. In terms of heat production, pinewood produces an intermediate amount compared to corn stalk and algae. This is largely caused by the yield of char from the pyrolysis of pinewood being in between the yields for corn stalk and algae. Similar to the results found from other authors [52], a high volume percentage of methane produced does not result in a high production of H2, despite a higher CH4 concentration leading to H2 production through the following reaction (CH4 + H2O > CO + 3H2). From Table 3 it can be seen that algae had the lowest concentration of CH4 yet had the most H2 production. However, the overall gas yield was highest from algae pyrolysis. Therefore, a small concentration of a larger volume of gas may lead to a larger amount of CH4 present and able to react to produce H2. Another important factor for the high H2 production from algae pyrolysis is the high concentration of H2 directly produced, without the CH4 reaction. The high original H2 yield with a large overall gas yield leads to the increased H2 yield. Another aspect that greatly impacts the products produced from biomass pyrolysis is the pyrolysis temperature. As can be seen from Table 7, the production of H2 increased from 65.3 to 85.6 gH2 kg−1 feedstock for algae, as the temperature was increased from 400 to 600 °C. Both pinewood and corn stalk experienced an increase in H2 production as temperature increased as well. Similar to reasons stated previously, an increasing gas yield leads to an increasing H2 yield as temperature is raised. The most significant impact was experienced when the temperature was increased from 400 °C to 500 °C for corn stalk pyrolysis; the H2 yield increased by 33%. Since the gas yield increases with temperature increase, the bio-oil and char are likely to decrease in yield. From Table 2 it can be seen that both the yield of char and oil for pinewood decreased by 42% and 53%, respectively, as the temperature was increased from 400 to 600 °C. The char yield decreased because at elevated temperatures, the thermal degradation of biomass is more effective and therefore results in more biomass decomposition [52]. The yield of char has been previously stated to have a significant impact on heat production from the pyrolysis process. Therefore, the decrease in heat production as temperature increases is expected. In conclusion, the algae-based system produces the most H2 per kilogram of feedstock used, however using algae also leads to the lowest heat production. The pyrolysis temperature had significant influences on the H2 yield and heat production as well. Increasing the pyrolysis temperature produces a higher yield of H2 and results in a lower production of heat."
12,Conclusion,"The objectives of the current study was to perform thermodynamic assessments and product characterization of pyrolytic polygeneration processes to identify potential applications of microwave-heated pyrolysis at commercial scale. It was found that both the temperature and raw biomass feedstock have significant impacts on energy efficiency, exergetic efficiency and the hydrogen production. The highest temperature, 600 °C, produced a greater thermodynamic efficiency and hydrogen production. It was demonstrated that the utilization of corn stalk resulted in the highest energy recovery, largely due to the higher char yield. The pyrolysis of algae feedstock produces the highest amount of hydrogen, since it resulted in a significantly larger gas yield compared to the other two feedstocks. This study provides evidence that there are several factors (e.g. pyrolysis temperature, biomass feedstock and products price) that have a significant impact on the pyrolysis process and need to be considered when designing an energy efficient and cost-effective microwave process. The present work employed a scaled-up pyrolysis reactor system to provide useful information to future researchers in improving the commercial level acceptance of the microwave-heated pyrolysis process. The improved thermodynamic efficiency and product quality from microwave heating compared to electrical heating should drive the commercial acceptance of the microwave-heated pyrolysis process."
