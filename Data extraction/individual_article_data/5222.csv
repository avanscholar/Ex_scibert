0,Introduction,"Catalytic conversions and applications of bio-based organic acids and their derivatives are of great significance [1]. High-value compounds such as alcohols [2] and lactones [3] can be obtained via catalytic reduction of carboxylic acids, which are important in synthetic organic chemistry [4,5]. Itaconic acid, one of the abundant and renewable bio-based platform chemicals [6], can be hydrogenated to produce methylsuccinic acid and methyl butyrolactone or other high-value products [1,2]. These products are available as polymer monomers, fuel additives, platform chemicals and fine-synthesis intermediates, which exhibit great potential prospects in industrialization [7]. Metal nanoparticles (NPs) catalysts are widely used in these hydrogenation reactions due to their remarkable catalytic activity with tunable particle size [8,9]. Usually, small active metal nanoparticles with high dispersion exhibit excellent catalytic performance but show a tendency of instability. Moreover, direct hydrogenation of organic acids and esters were usually carried out in the liquid phase at harsh conditions with high temperature about 180–280 °C [4]. Thus metal catalysts deactivation often emerged in such hydrogenation reactions [10–13], since small metal NPs are inclined to migrating and aggregating as well as dissolving and leaching [14,15], especially in high temperature aqueous acid conditions [16,17]. For example, Jamis’s group used Rh and Ru based-catalysts for hydrogenation of itaconic acid which showed more than 10% loss of activity after just 3 recycles [18]. It was supposed that the carboxyl group could coordinate to metal species giving rise to the deactivation in the hydrogenation of dicarboxylic acid [19,20]. In addition, conventional oxide supports such as SiO2 and Al2O3 are not stable with respect to the dissolution and structure change occurred in liquid water at high temperature [21,22]. Therefore, it is essential to develop stable heterogeneous catalysts with small particle sizes and uniform dispersion as well as good acid-resistance for hydrogenation of organic acids. Thus, to avoid the acid corrosion of supports and leaching of metal NPs is prerequisite for designing catalysts applied in the high temperature aqueous reactions of bio-based acids. It can be learned that carbon materials are much more inert and stable than most oxide supports in acid aqueous conditions [7], and are kinds of simple and common materials using in efficient immobilization of metal NPs [23,24]. Yang et al. used ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) materials to fabricate Ru−Ni bimetallic catalysts, which showed turnover frequency (TOF) up to 2000 h−1 in the hydrogenation of levulinic acid at 150 °C [25]. Su et al. prepared sandwiched Ru/C catalysts for the hydrogenation of benzene, which displayed no obvious deterioration after five reaction runs at 110 °C with no solvent [26]. However, the stability of carbon materials supported catalysts remains to be improved in long-time high-temperature aqueous acid conditions. For example, Starch-derived carbons supported Ru catalysts showed about 6% decrease of conversion in hydrogenation of itaconic acid at 100 °C after 3 runs of 45 min reaction [12]. Besides, using bulk carbons as supports could bring security issues, and difficulties of compressing and molding with limited mechanical strength [10,27]. On the other hand, it’s still a challenge to fabricate and maintain highly dispersed and stablized metal NPs with uniform small particle size. Various stabilization strategy for metal NPs such as anchoring [28], embedding [29,30], coating [31] and encapsulating [32,33] were put forward [34,35]. Most of them utilized the confinement via constructing limited space around metal NPs to hinder their movement in further to avoid active species against sintering and agglomeration [36]. However, such coating, embedding and encapsulating stabilization strategy might decrease the catalytic activity since the active metal sites could be capped partly [37]. For example, Ru NPs (1–2 nm) confined in OMC with various embedding degrees were fabricated, and only the appropriately embedded Ru catalysts affords a TOF up to 4.69 s−1 in toluene hydrogenation at 110 °C [38,39]. And recently, catalysts silica supported Pd overcoated with carbon (2.2 ± 0.6 nm) showed improved hydrothermal stability but lower activity as compared to the uncoated Pd/silica (1.2 ± 0.3 nm) in the acetone hydrogenation [40]. Thus it remains difficulties to prepare high-dispersed small metal NPs with high activity and stability for reactions in aqueous acid conditions at high temperature. Therefore, we hope to design a kind of catalysts that small metal NPs with uniform dispersion stabilized in a thin carbon shell via in-situ carbothermal reduction. To fabricate thin carbon shell is aimed at reducing carbon dosage, and providing appropriate carbon species required for carbothermal reduction [41–43]. Meanwhile, thin carbon shell derived from organic polymers can realize uniform dispersing of metal species through anchoring and separating by polymer chains, and further stabilizing metal NPs via confinement in the reduction [44]. Herein, we report the high-dispersed Ru NPs embedded in carbon species coated on silica nanospheres, fabricated via one-pot co-synthesis method, that metal precursors were directly doped in synthesis system along with the polymerization of resorcinol-formaldehyde resin coated on silica and following the carbothermal reduction process. The catalysts preparation and characterization are investigated through TEM, XRD, TGA, FT-IR and so on. The as-synthesized catalysts are applied in aqueous hydrogenation of itaconic acid at high temperature in order to compare the catalytic performance and hydrothermal stability with other catalysts. Such kind of catalysts showed uniform dispersion of small Ru NPs embedded in RF resin coated silica with core-shell structures, and performed higher hydrogenation activity and better stability than impregnated catalysts."

3,Catalysts preparation,"2.2 Catalysts preparation 2.2.1 Synthesis of SiO2 nanospheres Silica nanospheres (SiO2) were synthesized using a modified Stöber method. Typically, 2.8 mL of TEOS was added into a mixture drop by drop under stirring, which contained 50 mL ethanol, 25 mL deionised water and 3 mL NH3·H2O. After 24 hours stirring, silica nanospheres were collected by centrifugation; the solid sample was washed with water and ethanol, and then dried in the air at 110 °C for 12 h. 2.2.2 Synthesis of RF nanospheres Resorcinol formaldehyde resin (RF) nanospheres were synthesized using a similar Stöber method though phenol aldehyde condensation catalyzed by ammonia as the previous researchers reported [45,46]. Typically, 0.4 g resorcinol and 0.56 mL formaldehyde were added into a mixture containing 50 mL ethanol, 25 mL deionised water and 3 mL NH3·H2O under stirring for 24 h. Then the slurry was transferred into the hydrothermal synthesis reactor (100 ml), and putted in the oven at 100 °C for 24 h. The RF nanospheres were collected by centrifugation, washed with ethanol, dried in the air at 100 °C for 12 h. 2.2.3 Synthesis of Si-RF nanospheres Si-RF nanospheres were synthesized as the previous research using a modified one-pot method [47,48]. In a typical synthesis, 2.8 mL of TEOS was added into a mixture containing ethanol (50 mL), deionised water (25 mL) and NH3·H2O (3 mL) drop by drop under serious stirring. After that, 0.4 g resorcinol and 0.56 mL formaldehyde were then added into the mixture. Then the mixture was stirred for 24 h, and then was hydrothermal synthesized and collected as same as the preparation of RF nanospheres. 2.2.4 Synthesis of Ru-SiRF catalysts Ru-SiRF catalysts were synthesized via different paths as shown in Scheme 1 . In a typical synthesis of Ru-SiRF-A catalysts, 0.2880 g of RuCl3·xH2O (containing 1 mmol Ru) was added into the synthesis system of Si-RF nanospheres before stirring 24 hours as the path A. Then the slurry was then hydrothermal synthesized and separated as same as the preparation of Si-RF nanospheres. After that, Ru-SiRF-A catalysts precursors were collected. The sample that RuCl3 added after stirring 24 h but before hydrothermal synthesis as path B was named as Ru-SiRF-B. Ru-SiRF-C catalysts were prepared via a modified incipient-wetness impregnation method. Typically, 2 g as-prepared Si-RF materials were added into 2 mL of RuCl3 aqueous solution (containing 1 mmol Ru) in a beaker. The slurry was stirred for 3 minute s and ultrasonic treated for 3 minute s. Then the mixture was stewed for 24 h at room temperature and dried in oven at 100 °C for 12 h. These catalysts precursors were carbothermal reduced in 99.99% N2 flow with a rate of 20 mL/min via the programmed temperature process heated to 450 °C via 3.5 °C /min and kept for 3 h. 0.5Ru-SiRF-A and 2Ru-SiRF-A catalysts were prepared as doping 0.5 mmol Ru and 2 mmol Ru respectively. Ru-Si2RF-A was also prepared as the amounts of resorcinol and formaldehyde were double levels of Ru-SiRF-A. 2.2.5 Synthesis of other supported catalysts via impregnation Supported catalysts precursors such as Ru/SiO2, Ru/RF and previous reported Ru/AC were prepared via impregnation as same as Ru-SiRF-C catalysts precursors. Ru/SiO2 precursors were reduced in pure H2 flow, while Ru/AC and Ru/RF precursors were carbothermal reduced in pure N2 flow with the same programmed temperature process."
4,Catalysts characterization,"2.3 Catalysts characterization The morphology and average particle size of catalysts were determined by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) with a JEM-2100 microscope operated at 120 kV. Samples prepared by suspending them in ethanol with ultrasonic treatment were instilled on copper microscope grids covered with perforated carbon. Surface morphology and elemental analysis of as-prepared catalysts were observed by scanning electron microscope performed on JEOL JSM-7800F microscope using gentle beam (GB) mode with accelerating voltage of 1.0 kV and general SEM mode operate at 8–15 kV with UED and BED-C detectors. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were investigated on a Rigaku D/Max 2500 PC diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at a scan rate of 5° min−1 from 10° to 85° (2θ) at 40 kV/200 mA. Texture properties were achieved from Nitrogen adsorption-desorption experiments conducted at 77 K on Quantachrome Autosorb-1-C-MS. Samples were outgassed at 373 K for over 12 h before measurement. The surface area was obtained using multipoint Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model. FT-IR spectrum was experimented in a Bruker Tensor 27 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer to investigate the chemistry constitute of the prepared catalysts. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted to measure the weight loss and component changes of the prepared materials. TG-DSC measurements were performed on a NETZSCH STA 409 PC instrument with mass spectrometry detector (MS). All samples underwent pretreatments at 100 °C, and then tests were taken under a constant flow of N2, temperature was heated at a rate of 10 °C/min from 50 °C up to 800 °C. The in-situ monitoring of the carbothermal reduction process were performed on Micromeritics Auto Chem II 2920 Chemisorption Analyzer with both thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and mass spectrometry detector (MS). Sample placed in a U-shape quartz reactor was first pretreated at 200 °C in a pure Ar flow, and then heated from 50 °C to 450 °C with a rate of 5 °C /min and kept 60 min at 450 °C. Afterwards, the sample was purged by 10% H2/Ar gas stream with a rate of 25 cm3/min for 30–60 min and then changed into inert gas stream, after that the temperature was raised from 50 °C to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C /min."
5,Catalytic hydrogenation of itaconic acid,"2.4 Catalytic hydrogenation of itaconic acid Hydrogenation of itaconic acid was conducted in a 50 mL autoclave (Parr Instrument) equipped with an electronic temperature controller and a magnetic stirrer. In a typical reaction, 0.1 g reduced catalyst was introduced into 5 wt.% itaconic acid aqueous solution, then the reactor was purged several times and pressurized up to 50 bar with H2 after sealing. It was heated to 180 °C and kept for 360 min with a stirring of 1000 rpm. The main compounds like IA, MSA and MGBL were detected and analyzed by Waters e2695 High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) equipped with Waters 2489 UV/visible detector and Waters 2414 refractive index detector, using Prevail organic acid column and the mobile phase of aqueous H3PO4 solution. Other liquid products (BA, MBA, BO, etc.) were analyzed by an Agilent 7890 A gas chromatograph (GC) with a flame ionization detector (FID) through a HP 19091 j-323 capillary column. Gas phase products were collected and analyzed by Agilent 7890 A GC using a 19095 P-MSO column connected to a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The conversion and selectivity of main products in the liquid were calculated by the standard curves, other liquid and gas products distributions were calculated using calibration factors (Details shown in S2)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Synthesis and characterization of Ru-SiRF catalysts,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization of Ru-SiRF catalysts Resorcinol-formaldehyde resin was explored as carbon source to fabricate RF resin coated silica nanosphere materials (Si-RF). Meanwhile the active metal precursors were introduced in the synthesis system according to different introducing sequence as shown in Scheme 1. When RuCl3·xH2O were directly doped in the alkali synthesis system at the beginning of the polymerization process(step 3 in Scheme 1) as path A, catalysts precursor A and final catalysts Ru-SiRF-A could be obtained. Correspondingly, Ru-SiRF-B could be achieved via doping Ru precursors after polymerization but before hydrothermal process(step 4) as path B. Comparably, Ru-SiRF-C were prepared via impregnation that Ru species were doped in the obtained Si-RF nanospheres before reduction process(step 5) as path C. The catalysts Ru-SiRF were investigated by HR-TEM with particle size distributions calculated from TEM images as shown in Fig. 1 . Ru-SiRF-A catalysts were consisted of monodisperse nanospheres with apparent core-shell structures -- a silica core with a mean diameter of 122.4 nm covered with a thin RF resin shell about 8.2 nm of the thickness. Small Ru particles with an average particle size of 1.1 nm were homogeneously dispersed and embedded in the RF resin shell, which could be seen clearly in the Fig. 1(a). As for catalysts Ru-SiRF-B (Fig. 1(b)), silica cores with an average size of 194.4 nm were covered with nearly double thicker RF shell about 16.8 nm. It showed a narrow Ru particles size distribution with an average value about 1.4 nm. And it was observed that Ru particles were concentrated-dispersed on the surface of the RF resin shell, which was related to the addition of Ru metal salts after the polymerization of RF resin coating. For the impregnated catalysts Ru-SiRF-C (Fig. 1(c)), it could be clearly observed that Ru particles with various particle sizes were heterogeneously distributed on the nanospheres. The average Ru particle size was about 7.7 nm. The silica core with an average diameter of 198.6 nm was covered with a RF shell with a mean thickness of 22.2 nm. The difference of the silica core size, RF resin shell thickness and Ru particles dispersion with size distribution could be associated with the doping orders of RuCl3 arranged in the synthesis. For Ru-SiRF-A, RuCl3 was doped just after the addition of resorcinol and formaldehyde, could probably deposit along with the polymerization of RF resin in the alkaline system. Metal species were likely to be attached to the negatively charged O in C–O group of RF through electrostatic interactions [49,50], resulting in the uniform dispersion and stabilization of metal species, and could be effectively confined and separated by the surrounding long polymer chains even after carbothermal reduction as shown in Scheme 1. Smaller silica core and thinner RF shell were possibly caused by acidic RuCl3, which changed the system pH and further influenced the hydrolysis of TEOS and polymerization of RF. Thus, catalysts Ru-SiRF-A owned uniform small Ru NPs embedded in thin RF resin shell. As for catalyst Ru-SiRF-B, metal species dispersion were mainly controlled by hydroxide precipitation and electrostatic interactions deposited on the surface of RF resin shell. Thus Ru precursors and related Ru NPs mainly distributed on the surface. As for impregnated catalyst Ru-SiRF-C, metal species were just loaded on the surface with weak interactions, leading to non-uniform distribution of Ru NPs after carbothermal reduction. It was supported that the proposed co-synthesis method could be an effective technique for fabrication homogeneously distributed Ru NPs catalysts. In order to further investigate the availability and tunability of the one-pot co-synthesis method for fabrication such kind of catalysts, sample with double thicker RF shell was prepared as the path A via regulating the amount of resorcinol and formaldehyde to double levels, which was marked as Ru-Si2RF-A and also characterized by TEM showed in Fig. 1(d). Ru-Si2RF-A owned the similar silica core about 125.6 nm and the RF shell with double thickness of 16.9 nm compared to Ru-SiRF-A. Ru NPs in the Ru-Si2RF-A catalyst were so small that the average particle size was less than 1 nm. Catalysts Ru-SiRF-A and Ru-Si2RF-A were further characterized by SEM in combination with Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS) to analysis element contents as shown in Fig. 2 . The UED image of Ru-SiRF-A showed uniform monodisperse nanospheres and the dark BED-C image showed light spheres covered with thin shell. For Ru-Si2RF-A, UED image showed clearly that monodisperse nanospheres with smooth surface owned uniform size, and BED-C image presented apparent core-shell structure of the RF coated silica. No large metal NPs were observed in both samples. The element analysis revealed that there were mainly four element components: C, O, Si and Ru existed in the nanospheres. And the weight contents of Ru were about 3.21% and 2.94% in catalyst Ru-SiRF-A and Ru-Si2RF-A respectively (seen in S1.1). This phenomenon indicates that Ru species are homogeneously distributed in the RF resin shell. The prepared catalysts were characterized via X-ray diffraction (XRD) to further understand the catalysts structure and crystalline phases of Ru species. All the XRD patterns were presented in Fig. 3 . The wide peak around 2θ of 20–22 ° could be ascribed to the amorphous structure of silica or carbon. 49 The diffraction peaks at 2θ of 38.4°, 42.2°, 44.0°, 58.3°, 69.4° and 78.4° were attributed to (100), (002), (101), (102), (110) and (103) crystal planes of Ru respectively (ICDD-JCPDS card No. 06-0663). As shown in Fig. 3, there was weak characteristic diffraction peak of Ru (101) crystal plane at 2θ of 44 ° in the co-synthesis catalysts Ru-SiRF-A, Ru-Si2RF-A and Ru-SiRF-B, which inferred that Ru species in the co-synthesis catalysts probably were highly dispersed. All the diffraction peaks showed clearly in impregnated samples, which indicated that large Ru crystals were formed on the nanospheres. It was notable that there was no characteristic peak of ruthenium oxide or other Ru species appeared in the XRD patterns, which inferred that Ru species had reduced into metallic Ru via calcinations in inert N2 atmosphere at 450 °C. This result was consistent with our previous research [43]. Furthermore, average particle size of Ru NPs was calculated by Scherrer formula presented in Table 1 . The impregnated catalysts Ru/RF, Ru/SiO2 and Ru-SiRF-C showed average Ru particle size about 21.9 nm, 19.8 nm and 16.1 nm respectively, associating with the relevant strong intensity of diffraction peaks. While for the co-synthesis catalysts, Ru-SiRF-B, Ru-SiRF-A and Ru-Si2RF-A owned much smaller Ru NPs with mean size about 4.9 nm, 1.8 nm, and 2.1 nm respectively according to the weak diffraction peaks. The average particle size of Ru NPs was ranged in the order of Ru-SiRF-C > Ru-SiRF-B > Ru-SiRF-A ≈ Ru-Si2RF-A, which was identical with the TEM results. It can be concluded that Ru precursors directly doped in the synthesis system were homogeneously dispersed in or on the RF resin shell in co-synthesis samples resulting in uniform small Ru NPs. Textural characteristics of supports and catalysts were analysed by nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements. And the BET surface area of as-prepared catalysts was presented in the Table 1. BET surface area (SBET) of the co-synthesis catalysts Ru-SiRF-A and Ru-SiRF-B were about 171 m2/g and 126 m2/g. Comparably, the impregnated catalysts Ru-SiRF-C showed lower SBET of 105 m2/g. It was interesting to find that SBET decreased gradually in the sequence of metal salts addition. Towards catalyst Ru-SiRF-A, metal salts doped in the formation of RF resin, leading to uniform distribution of Ru species in the RF shell, which helped pore formation and expansion via the carbothermal reduction combined with decomposition of RF resin and loss of carbon species during the heating treatment. It can be proved by the increased pore volume that catalyst Ru-SiRF-A has 0.55 cm3/g while the catalyst precursor has only 0.20 cm3/g total pore volume (shown in Table S1). And the single supports Si-RF calcined at 450 °C only showed 0.36 cm3/g pore volume with 130 cm3/g SBET. As for Ru-SiRF-B, Ru species were uniformly distributed in the surface of RF shell, that meant pore formation and expansion mostly occurred at the surface, which influenced the SBET a little and resembled the supports SiRF-450. While the impregnated samples Ru-SiRF-C had non-uniform dispersion of Ru species, which just loaded on the surface, thus the surface consumption of carbon species leaded to decrease of surface area. What’s more, increasing the amount of RF improved SBET when comparing the catalysts Ru-Si2RF-A with others. From the above, it was notable that the co-synthesized catalyst Ru-SiRF-A owned higher SBET, thus such kind of synthesis strategy can be an effective method to prepare catalysts with improved pore structure and BET surface area. Feedstock adding amounts and Ru content in catalysts precursors were also shown in the Table 1, and details presented in Table S2 in ESI. The co-synthesis catalyst precursors had a little higher Ru content as compared to impregnated precursors. It inferred that such a co-synthesis method could be applied for preparing catalysts required high active metal contents with uniform small metal particles. To investigate the structure of prepared catalysts, samples were characterized with FT-IR spectra as shown in Fig. 4 . IR spectra of catalysts Ru-SiRF-A, Ru-SiRF-B and Ru-SiRF-C were resemble with each other. The band around 3420 cm−1 is due to the asymmetric stretching vibration of –OH caused by the hydrolysis of TEOS and condensation of resorcinol with formaldehyde [48]. Bands at 2926 cm−1, 1612 cm−1 and 1450 cm- 1 are typical of the stretching vibration of –CH2– groups, aromatic skeleton vibration and bending vibration of CH groups respectively [48,51]. These are characteristics of the RF resin associating with the spectrum of RF supports (Fig. S2). Strong and broad peak around 1100 cm−1 was characteristic of asymmetric stretching vibration of Si–O–Si bond, besides, bands at 800 and 460 cm−1 are attributed to the symmetric stretching vibration and bending vibration of Si–O bond (as same as SiO2 in Fig. S3) [48]. Such characteristic bands confirmed that polymerized RF resin and silica existed in catalysts Ru-SiRF. It also indicated that the RF resin shell in catalysts carbothermal reduced at 450 °C probably was carbonized incompletely. In further, the supports Si-RF nanospheres calcined at 450 °C and 750 °C were also investigated (shown in Fig. S4). Characteristic bands at 2926 cm−1 and 1450 cm- 1 related to RF resin disappeared in sample SiRF-750, which inferred that complete carbonization of decomposable RF resin could be achieved during the calcination at 750 °C. While sample SiRF-450 retained some –CH2– groups and CH groups as same as catalysts Ru-SiRF carbothermal reduced at 450 °C. It was supposed that Ru-SiRF catalysts own incompletely carbonized structure with the existence of organic aromatic chemicals. To gain more insight, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were performed on TG-DSC instruments combined with mass spectrometry detector (MS) in order to trace the change of chemical components in the calcination and reduction process. The weight loss curves and DTG curves of samples were showed in Fig. 5 (Details in S1.5). Catalysts precursors of Ru-SiRF-A (Ru-SiRF-Ap) and Ru-SiRF-C (Ru-SiRF-Cp) showed about 16.9% and 16.1% weight loss at 450 °C, and about 31.7% and 25.9% weight loss at 800 °C for each other, while supports Si-RF had 13.8% and 22.3% weight loss at 450 °C and 800 °C respectively. It was notable that Ru-SiRF-Cp and Ru-SiRF-Ap had more weight loss than Si-RF supports. The analogous phenomena that Ru-contained catalysts precursors presented higher weight loss than the corresponding supports, was also shown in the carbonized couple of samples SiRF-750 and catalyst Ru/SiRF-750 precursors (Ru/SiRF-750p). As seen in the Fig. 5, there was nearly no weight loss for SiRF-750, which indicated that calcination at 750 °C could lead to complete carbonization of RF resin. Comparably, precursors Ru/SiRF-750p had about 5.0% and 9.0% weight loss at 450 and 800 °C. It can be seen that an extra peak at 325 °C existed in DTG curves of Ru-SiRF-Cp and Ru-SiRF-Ap as compared to Si-RF, which could be attributed to the carbothermal reduction of Ru species along with the consumption of carbon species in accordance with our previous research [43]. The weight loss peaks below 200 °C could be referred to the loss of water. Similarly, there was an extra peak at 425 °C in DTG curves of Ru/SiRF-750p as compared to SiRF-750, so the increased weight loss in Ru/SiRF-750p was not only because of the loss of water associating with the weight loss peaks below 200 °C, but also a result of carbothermal reduction of Ru species. Weight loss above 450 °C for sample Si-RF and related Ru-SiRF-Ap, Ru-SiRF-Cp can be associated with the peaks around 500 °C and 545 °C in DTG curves, which was in relation to the further decomposition and carbonization of RF resin. As for co-synthesis precursors Ru-SiRF-Ap, this peak increased and shifted to lower temperature, probably was due to the further decomposition catalyzed by the adjacent Ru species [45], leading to 6% more weight loss than Ru-SiRF-Cp at 800 °C. While there was no weight loss peaks above 500 °C for the carbonized couple of samples, indicating that Si-RF calcined at 750 °C were completely carbonized without any further decomposition of RF resin. Thus, it can be speculated that Ru-SiRF catalysts carbothermal reduced at 450 °C own incompletely carbonized RF resin shell. And for catalyst Ru-SiRF-A, Ru species dispersed in the RF resin probably had interactions with RF resin, which lead to further decomposition of RF resin easily occurred. In order to understand the carbothermal reduction and carbonization process of catalyst Ru-SiRF-A, in-situ monitoring coupled with a temperature-programmed treatment was performed on chemisorption analyzer with TCD and MS detectors. Catalyst precursors Ru-SiRF-Ap was heating in Ar atmosphere from room temperature to 450 °C with a rate of 5 °C/min and kept 60 min at 450 °C, and the released compounds was monitoring in situ by MS detector. MS signal with m/z of 16, 28 and 44 were monitored, which could be attributed to CH4, CO and CO2 respectively as shown in Fig. 6 . It can be found that CO2 was detected at first, and then CH4 appeared. The released CO2 and CH4 reached a peak around 350 °C, which was in accordance with the above TGA results. An increasing amount of CO was subsequently detected above 350 °C. It coincided with our previous research, the easily released CO could reduce Ru species and produced CO2 at first, and then the extra CO were detected. In the subsequent He-TPD test, no apparent peak appeared below 450 °C in each signal curve. It indicated that catalyst Ru-SiRF-A carbothermal reduced at 450 °C were thermal stable below 450 °C without any decomposed compounds. CO and CH4 were detected again above 450 °C, which was probably due to the further decomposition of the RF resin shell catalyzed by adjacent Ru species as same as the above TGA tests. From the above, co-synthesis catalysts Ru-SiRF-A possessed highly dispersed Ru nanoparticles with average particle size about 1.1 nm embedded in incomplete carbonized RF resin shell; while catalysts Ru-SiRF-B presented uniform Ru NPs with mean diameter of 1.4 nm concentrated on the surface of RF resin shell, and impregnated catalysts Ru-SiRF-C owned large Ru NPs with various sizes unevenly distributed on the surface of RF resin coated silica. During the synthesis of Ru-SiRF catalysts, the direct incorporation of metal salts in the alkali synthesis system resulted in deposition-precipitation of metal species occurring along with polymerization of resorcinol and formaldehyde in the meanwhile, and effective confinement and separation by the surrounding long polymer chains, which further led to the uniform dispersion and stabilization of metal NPs. And the following calcination process realized in-situ carbothermal reduction of Ru species, the decomposition and carbonization of RF resin simultaneously."
8,Catalytic performance in hydrogenation of itaconic acid,"3.2 Catalytic performance in hydrogenation of itaconic acid The catalytic performances of prepared catalysts are investigated using aqueous hydrogenation of itaconic acid as a probe reaction. Typically, the hydrogenation reaction was carried out at 180 °C for 6 h with 50 bar initial pressure of H2. Main products were methylsuccinic acid (MSA) and methylbutyrolactone (2-MGBL and 3-MGBL), and by-products included butyric acid (i-BA and n-BA), butanol (i-BO and n-BO), methylbutyric acid(2-MBA and 3-MBA), and the released gas methane, etc. (Details in S2). It is notable that the conversion of IA could reach 99.9% easily as a result of hydrogenation of CC bond via Ru-based catalysts, which could occur at low temperature as reported in our previous research [37]. Thus the further hydrogenation of MSA and the production of MGBL can reflect the difference of catalytic activity. The products distributions for each catalyst were presented in Table 2 . It can be found that the co-synthesis catalysts Ru-SiRF-A obtained about 22.8% MSA and 39.9% MGBL. For Ru-SiRF-B, the MSA proportion and MGBL yield were 37.2% and 33.2% respectively. While for impregnated catalyst Ru-SiRF-C, the distribution of MSA and MGBL were 67.7% and 20.5% for each other. The proportion of MSA increased dramatically while the MGBL yield decreased gradually in the order of Ru-SiRF-A, Ru-SiRF-B and Ru-SiRF-C. It can be concluded that the co-synthesis catalysts exhibited better hydrogenation activity of MSA and higher yield of MGBL. It was believed that high BET surface area and small Ru NPs with uniform dispersion were benefit to the catalytic performance. Catalysts Ru-SiRF-A own higher SBET about 170.6 m2/g and smaller Ru NPs with mean diameter of 1.1 nm, as comparing to catalyst Ru-SiRF-B which presented 1.4 nm Ru NPs with 126.1 m2/g BET surface area, and catalyst Ru-SiRF-C owned large Ru NPs about 7 nm with small SBET about 104.7 m2/g. Thus, the catalytic performances were ranged in the same order: Ru-SiRF-A>Ru-SiRF-B>>Ru-SiRF-C for MSA conversion and MGBL yield. Catalyst Ru-SiRF-A with small Ru NPs embedded in the RF resin shell exhibited good hydrogenation activity and selectivity to MGBL in this conversion of IA. Catalyst Ru-SiRF-A with different loading amounts of Ru and different dosages are also investigated in the reaction, and the results are listed in Table 2. It can be found that when increasing the Ru loading amounts (2Ru-SiRF-A) or using more catalysts (Ru-SiRF-Ab, 0.15 g), the proportion of MSA were obviously decreased to 4.0% or 2.2% respectively. Decreasing the corresponding amounts, MSA proportion were 43.1% and 42.0% for 0.5Ru-SiRF-A and 0.05 g catalysts (Ru-SiRF-Aa) as shown in Table 2. The results indicated that increasing the amount of Ru could promote the hydrogenation activity. However, changing the amount of Ru had little benefits on the yield of MGBL, using excessive amounts of Ru may lead to the generation of by-products like BA, CH4 and other bond-cleavage products, as excessive hydrogenation of MSA and MGBL occurred. It can be seen that the yield of MGBL decreased to 21.6% when 0.15 g Ru-SiRF-A was used. Thus appropriate amount of active Ru species and catalysts were required for the yield of MGBL. Ru-SiRF-A carbothermal reduced at 750 °C (Ru-SiRF-A-750) was further investigated and achieved 35.9% proportion of MSA, and 28.4% yield of MGBL, which was lower than that of catalyst reduced at 450 °C. It can be known that Ru-SiRF-A-750 owned complete carbonized RF resin shell as the above study. It was possible that carbothermal reduction at 750 °C led to an increase in particle size of Ru nanoparticles, thereby decreasing its hydrogenation activity. Therefore, Ru-SiRF-A reduced at 450 °C could be benefited from the uniform small Ru NPs embedded in the incompletely carbonized organic components for the effective catalytic hydrogenation of itaconic acid. The stability and durability of Ru-SiRF catalyst was further investigated by recycle tests comparing with impregnated catalysts Ru/SiO2, Ru/RF and Ru/AC. Results were presented in Fig. 7 . The productions of MGBL at per mol Ru for each kind of catalysts were calculated to evaluate the stability of catalytic performance in three runs. It was obviously observed that Ru/SiO2 and Ru/RF showed much lower production of MGBL merely about 8.3 and 17.9 mol per mol Ru at the first run, which probably were attributed to the large Ru NPs and instability of catalysts in aqueous at high temperature. Comparatively, Ru-SiRF-A and Ru-Si2RF-A with double thick RF shell performed much more stable and higher yield of MGBL in three recycle times. Both of them obtained and maintained nearly 36.5 mol/mol MGBL productions per unit Ru, which were better than previous reported catalysts Ru/AC with 30 mol MGBL production per mol Ru. Catalyst Ru-SiRF-A after three recycles was further studied by TEM and XRD (right in Fig. 7). There was no obvious agglomeration of Ru particles or other crystals or phase change could be observed, and Ru particles with an average particle size about 1.7 nm remained embedding in the intact RF shell though the silica core collapsed a little. As for Ru-SiRF catalysts, the coated RF resin shell could protect the silica spheres, and the silica core could support and prevent the thin shell from breakage to an extent. In addition, catalyst Ru-SiRF-A with Ru NPs embedded in incompletely carbonized RF resin shell were supposed to be stable with confinement in migration or leaching of Ru species due to the interaction between Ru species and organic carbon compounds. As for catalyst Ru-Si2RF-A, the thicker RF shell enhanced the stability and catalytic performance. It could be inferred that RF resin coating improved the stability and the thickness of RF shell affected the activity. The results further demonstrate that the co-synthesis catalysts Ru NPs embedded in carbon species coated on silica exhibited better hydrogenation activity and stability than other kinds of catalysts."
9,Conclusions,"We have designed and prepared a kind of catalyst that highly dispersed Ru NPs embedded in carbon species coated on silica nanospheres via one-pot co-synthesis strategy in combination with in-situ carbothermal reduction for high-temperature aqueous hydrogenation of itaconic acid. Catalysts Ru-SiRF-A were prepared via doping metal precursors in the synthesis system of RF resin coated silica nanospheres, where deposition-precipitation of metal species occurred along with polymerization of resorcinol and formaldehyde simultaneously, uniform dispersion and stabilization of metal species were effectively realized through confinement and separation by the surrounding long polymer chains even after carbothermal reduction. Such kind of catalysts has small Ru NPs with an average size about 1.1 nm, homogeneously dispersed in the incomplete carbonized RF resin shell coated on silica nanospheres with core-shell structures. The synthesized catalysts showed high activity in the aqueous hydrogenation of itaconic acid and gained nearly 40% yield of methyl-butyrolactone. Moreover, the co-synthesis catalysts Ru-SiRF-A performed good stability and resistance to acid with no obvious loss of activity and less sintering in recycling tests compared to traditional impregnated Ru catalysts. Such one-pot co-synthesis method can be widely and effectively used in preparing various kinds of stable nanometal catalysts with controllability, and applied in various hydrogenation reactions under harsh conditions."
