0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is considered as a promising future energy source which is clean and sustainable. Hydrogen emits only water vapors as its oxidation product and does not contribute to carbon emission (Kumar and Lin, 2013 and Hernandez-Mendoza and Buitron, 2013). Hydrogen has high energy content per unit of 120MJ/kg, which is highest among other gaseous fuels such as gasoline (44MJ/kg), methane (50MJ/kg) and ethanol (26.8MJ/kg) (Lin et al., 2012 and Kumar and Lin, 2014). Today, most of the hydrogen is produced by pyrolysis, gasification and steam reforming of fossil fuels (Jain, 2009; Acar and Dincer, 2014). However, hydrogen can be produced from a wide variety of biomass-based substrate to make it sustainable and renewable (Guo et al., 2010 and Lai et al., 2014). At the same time, the management of waste has become a serious problem of the modern times. Most of the waste produced is dumped in the open areas creating severe environmental problems. The organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) is highly degradable (Rao et al., 2000), thus anaerobic fermentation of OFMSW can be one of the promising methods to generate hydrogen as it is abundant and free of cost (Kafle and Kim, 2013). Furthermore, it provides the eco-friendly solution to organic waste by converting it into biofuel. The composition of waste greatly influences the yield of the gas. Variation in waste composition occurs due to climate, collection frequency and seasonal factors (Tchobanoglous et al., 1997). Municipal solid waste consists of the lignocellulosic material which generally comprises of polymerized sugars such as cellulose and hemicelluloses (Gupta et al., 2014). Hydrolysis of lignocellulosic material generates wide ranges of by-products, which are inhibitory to anaerobic microorganisms. These by-products are primarily furan derivatives, phenolic compounds, and weak acids. Furan derivatives (such as furfural and 5-hydroxymethyfurfural) are generated from sugar degradation; Phenolic compounds (such as syringaldehyde and vanillin) are generated from lignin, and weak acids such as acetate are derived from hemicellulose degradation (Quemeneur et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2014; Park et al., 2011; Siqueira and Reginatto, 2015). Cao et al. (2010), demonstrated the inhibitory effect of furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, and phenolic compounds using Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum W16 and acid-pretreated corn stalk as substrate. Higher concentrations of these inhibitors strongly influence hydrogen yield and lag phase (Kongjan and Angelidaki, 2010). Fangkum and Reungsang (2011), studied hydrogen production from the hydrolysate of sugarcane bagasse at a concentration of 10g/L using elephant dung as inoculum achieving a maximum H2 yield of 0.84mol hydrogen/mol sugar consumed and substrate degradation of 86% was recorded. Substrate degradation was decreased with increase in sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate, because the hydrolysate contained furfural at a concentration of 220mg/L. Lin et al. (2015), studied hydrogen production from mesophilic batch culture supplemented with a 15mM concentration of furan derivatives (furfural and 5-hydroxymethyfurfural) and phenolic compounds (vanillin and syringaldehyde) and reported that aforementioned inhibitors negatively affected hydrogen production. Microorganisms can minimize the effect of these inhibitors into less toxic compounds if their concentration is within the limit of microbial tolerance (Boopathy et al., 1993; Liu et al., 2005). It is necessary to determine the inhibition threshold levels of inhibitors so as to reduce toxicity and maintain microbial which improves hydrogen production. Therefore, understanding the impact of inhibitors on anaerobic digestion is essential to enhance hydrogen production. A large number of microbial species belonging to different taxonomic and physiological types can generate hydrogen by fermentation. Some prominent hydrogen producing bacteria are clostridia (Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium pasteurianum, Clostridium welchii, Clostridium beijerincki), Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Bacillus and Alcaligenes etc (Das and Veziroglu, 2001; Hallenbeck and Benemann, 2002). Co-culture of facultative anaerobes E. coli and Enterobacter aerogenes was used in the present study. These bacteria have been reported to generate molecular hydrogen by their metabolic activities (Das and Veziroglu, 2001). Both E. coli and Enterobacter aerogenes are very useful hydrogen producer with higher hydrogen evolution rate (Converti and Perego, 2002; Nakashimada et al., 2002). Both are facultative anaerobe and can grow under aerobic as well as strict anaerobic conditions. They produce hydrogen by two direct routes which are formate pathway and NADH pathway (Lu et al., 2009; Bohm et al., 1990; and Zinoni et al., 1986). Under formate pathway, formate is formed from glucose by anaerobic metabolism which quickly transforms into hydrogen by formate hydrogen lyase complex. This complex consists of hydrogenase, formate dehydrogenase, and electron transfer mediators. Under NADH pathway, NADH is involved as a precursor in hydrogen production through ferredoxin-NAD+ reductase and ferredoxin hydrogenase (Morimoto et al., 2005). Maru et al. (2016), used co-culture of Enterobacter sp and E. coli and found a 3.1-fold higher hydrogen productivity from pure glycerol. The objective of the present study was to assess the impact of furan derivatives viz. furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) and phenolic compounds viz. vanillin and syringaldehyde, on hydrogen production from organic fraction of municipal solid waste using co-culture of facultative anaerobes Enterobacter aerogenes and E. coli."
1,Methods and material,
2,Feedstock,"2.1 Feedstock The organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) was collected from a local municipal landfill site located in Rudrapur, Uttarakhand, India. OFMSW consisted of household waste such as vegetables, fruits, rice, beans, bread, some meat, and paper. OFMSW was ground using an electrical grinder without dilution which resulted in the particle size of less than 2mm. the feedstock was stored at low temperature (−4°C) to avoid its degradation at room temperature. It results into approximately constant compositions of the waste during the whole experiment. The characteristics of OFMSW were as follows: Density=1010.5±25.3(kg/m3); Total solids=24.0±1.34% (w/w); volatile solids=19.0±2.32% (w/w); pCOD (particulate chemical oxygen demand)=43.0±3.12(g/L); sCOD (soluble chemical oxygen demand)=11.0±1.57(g/L); tCOD (total chemical oxygen demand)=54.0±4.69 (g/L); total Kjeldahl nitrogen=3.2±0.21(g/L); ammonia=0.389±5.22(g/L); Carbohydrates=26.8±2.42(g/L); lipids=3.1±0.1(g/L); proteins=20.4±2.32(g/L); C/N ratio=30.19±3.87; acetate=0.638±0.12(g/L); butyrate=0.563±0.11(g/L); propionate=0.056±0.04(g/L); lactate=0.198±0.15(g/L); Total volatile fatty acids=1.455±0.42(g/L)."
3,Microorganisms and media,"2.2 Microorganisms and media Facultative anaerobes Enterobacter aerogenes and E. coli were isolated from sewage sludge using selective and differential media Eosin Methylene Blue (EMB) Agar. The isolated strains were further grown in LB (Luria-Bertani) medium (10g peptone, 5g yeast extract and 10g sodium chloride per liter) separately in an incubator at 37°C. The bacteria were cultured for more than five generations before they were used for the experiment."
4,Inhibitors,2.3 Inhibitors Furan derivatives (furfural and 5-hydroxymethyfurfural) and phenolic compounds (vanillin and syringaldehyde) were used in the present study. Their characteristics are given in Table 1 .
5,Experimental design conditions,"2.4 Experimental design conditions The experiments were conducted using 500ml Duran reagent bottles with screw caps having butyl rubber fitted in it to extract gas sample. The working volume of 350ml was used. Each bottle was filled with 300ml of organic fraction of municipal solid waste (20gm/L OFMSW). The medium was sparged with pure nitrogen gas for 5min, capped tightly with butyl rubber and sealed with aluminum caps. All media were sterilized using an autoclave at 121°C and 15 psi for 30min. Each bottle was then inoculated with 50ml of seed inoculum which consists of 25ml of Enterobacter aerogenes cell suspension and 25ml of E. coli cell suspension using a sterile syringe. Since facultative anaerobic bacteria create a perfect environment for anaerobic fermentation by consuming remaining oxygen, thus co-culture system results in increased hydrogen production (Pachapur et al., 2016 and Pachapur et al., 2015). Analysis of each treatment was done in triplicate. Inhibitors were applied in the concentration ranges of 0.25g/L, 0.5g/L, 1g/L, 2g/L and 5g/L each, using a sterile syringe. Then, the bottles were incubated at 37°C in an incubator shaker. The initial pH was maintained at 5.5 using 2NNaOH and 2NHCl. The amount and composition of gas samples were analyzed periodically every 24h."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods Total solids (TS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), volatile solids (VS), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), Ammonia and lipids were estimated by standard methods (APHA, 2005). Carbohydrates and proteins were estimated by phenol-sulfuric acid method (Han et al., 2012) and colorimetric method (Reddy et al., 2011) respectively. For soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD), the samples were filtered through 0.45μm filter paper which removes particulate COD and then sCOD was estimated by APHA, 2005 method. Particulate COD is calculated as follows: pCOD=tCOD−sCOD. Where pCOD is particulate chemical oxygen demand, tCOD is total chemical oxygen demand and sCOD is soluble chemical oxygen demand. The concentrations of furfural, 5-hydroxymethyfurfural, vanillin and syringaldehyde were estimated by high-performance liquid chromatography (Agilent 1200, USA) equipped with an Aminex HPX-87H column and ultraviolet detector at 278nm. The mobile phase used was 5mM H2SO4 at 65°C and 0.5ml/min flow rate."
7,Gaseous analysis,"2.6 Gaseous analysis Hydrogen and carbon dioxide gasses were analyzed using gas chromatography (GC-2014, Shimadzu) equipped with a 0.2m X 3-mm diameter porapak Q column fitted with thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The operational temperatures were maintained for the column, oven, injection port and the detector at 120°C, 100°C and 150°C respectively. Helium, at a flow rate of 35ml/min, was used as the carrier gas. Methane and volatile fatty acids were analyzed by GC with the same operational conditions using flame ionization detector (FID). To estimate hydrogen potential and maximum hydrogen production rate, modified Gompertz equation was used. (1) H = P exp - exp R max P ( λ - t ) + 1 where H is the cumulative hydrogen production (ml) at reaction time t; P (ml) is the hydrogen potential; Rmax is the maximum hydrogen production rate (ml/h); λ is the lag time (h) and t is the incubation time (h); e=2.71828. Inhibition coefficient for individual inhibitor was calculated using following formula: (2) Inhibition coefficient = 100 - hydrogen yield from OFMSW with inhibitor hydrogen yield from OFMSW × 100"
8,Results and discussion,
9,Effect of furan derivatives on hydrogen production,"3.1 Effect of furan derivatives on hydrogen production As can be seen from Table 2 , furan derivatives, furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) have a significant impact on hydrogen production from OFMSW. Data for cumulative hydrogen production was correlated with Gompertz model equation and the kinetic parameters were determined by regression analysis. It was observed that increasing the furfural concentration from nil to 0.25g/L resulted in a slight increase in cumulative hydrogen production and volumetric hydrogen production from 208.1±10.6ml to 245.3±10.9ml and from 0.59 LH2/Lsubstrate to 0.70 LH2/Lsubstrate respectively. Further increase in furfural concentration declined hydrogen production and a minimum of 106.9±13.2ml cumulative hydrogen production was obtained at furfural concentration of 5g/L. The effect of furan derivatives on hydrogen yield and hydrogen production rate has been shown in fig.1 (a) and fig.1(b) respectively. In control condition, the hydrogen yield was 22.18mlH2/gCarboinitial and the corresponding H2 production peak rate was 17.3ml/h. The H2 yield declined to 19.7mlH2/gCarboinitial and 17.9mlH2/gCarboinitial with the addition of furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural respectively and the corresponding peak H2 production rates declined to 15.4ml/h and 14.0ml/h respectively. Haroun et al. (2016), investigated the effect of furfural on hydrogen yield in a glucose-fed reactor and reported that initial hydrogen yield of 2.27mol hydrogen/mol glucose increased by 17% and 6% at 0.25g/L and 0.5g/L furfural respectively, while a decrease of 21%, 29%, and 62% was observed at 1, 2 and 4g/L furfural concentrations respectively. Monlau et al. (2013), reported a significant decrease in hydrogen yield from 2.04mol hydrogen/mol hexose with no furfural to 1.83mol hydrogen/mol hexose and 0.45mol hydrogen/mol hexose at 0.086g/L and 0.172g/L furfural respectively. Similar study was done by Cao et al. (2010), who investigated hydrogen production from acid pretreated corn stover hydrolysate using Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum W16 in batches and reported a significant decrease (50% inhibition) in hydrogen production at 1g/L furfural with little or nil hydrogen production at 1.8g/L furfural. Nasr et al. (2014), found no adverse impact of furfural concentration below 1.09g/L on hydrogen production from pre-treated corn cobs using mesophilic anaerobic digester sludge. While all the aforementioned studies reported furfural inhibition, threshold levels of inhibition varied because of changes in furfural-to-biomass and furfural-to-sugar ratios. A similar pattern was observed for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) supplementation, which caused a slight increase in hydrogen production at a low concentration resulting in 235.2±12.0ml cumulative hydrogen at 0.25g/L 5-HMF (Table 2). Higher concentrations of 5-HMF caused a severe decrease in hydrogen production resulting in a minimum cumulative hydrogen production of 82.1±10.1ml, at 5g/L 5-HMF. Similar results were found by Cao et al. (2010), who reported that 5-hydroxymethylfurfural had a greater negative impact on hydrogen production as compare to furfural. Hydrogen yield increased slightly from 22.18mlH2/gCarboinitial at control to 25.07mlH2/gCarboinitial at 0.25g/L 5-HMF (fig.1b). Further increase in 5-HMF concentration decreased hydrogen yield. Gompertz kinetic parameters lag phase (λ) and maximum hydrogen production rate (Rmax) were found to be dependent on inhibitor concentration (Table 2). Maximum hydrogen production rate (Rmax) slightly increased from 17.3±2.6ml/h at nil concentration of inhibitors to 20.4±2.0ml/h and 19.6±2.3h at 0.25g/L concentrations of furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural respectively. Further increase in inhibitors (furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural) concentration resulted in a decline of Rmax. Lag phase slightly decreased for the lower concentration of furfural (<0.5g/L) and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (<0.25g/L), but significantly increased at higher concentrations. Hydrogen content ranged from 45% to 78% in gas composition in experimental batches supplemented with furan derivatives. The remaining portion of gas mainly consisted of CO2 while no methane was detected in gas samples."
10,Effect of phenolics on hydrogen production,"3.2 Effect of phenolics on hydrogen production Hydrogen production potential of OFMSW supplemented with various concentrations of phenolic compounds is presented in Table 2. Results show that phenolic compounds addition adversely affected hydrogen production. Hydrogen production declined from 208.1±10.6ml at control without inhibitor supplementation to 178.3±11.2ml and 194.2±14.0ml at 0.25g/L dosages of vanillin and syringaldehyde respectively. For 5g/L concentration of vanillin and syringaldehyde, minimum hydrogen production of 11.1±10.5ml and 21.5±11.4ml were obtained respectively. The effect of phenolic compounds on hydrogen yield and hydrogen production rate has been shown in fig. 1(a and b). The hydrogen yield of 11.2mlH2/gCarboinitial and 12.8mlH2/gCarboinitial was obtained with the addition of vanillin and syringaldehyde respectively and the corresponding peak hydrogen production rates were recorded as 8.7ml/h and 10.1ml/h respectively. Similar results were found by Lin et al. (2015), who observed a decrease in hydrogen yield potentials from 250.6ml/g to 215.4ml/g and 222.2ml/g with the addition of vanillin and syringaldehyde respectively. Clearly, vanillin caused more inhibition of hydrogen production as compare to syringaldehyde. The higher inhibition by vanillin is attributed to its lower molecular weight which caused its rapid diffusion into the microbial cell. Low molecular weight phenolic compounds have been considered to cause more toxicity to microbes than high molecular weight phenolic compounds (Klinke et al., 2004). Maximum hydrogen production rate (Rmax) decreased from 17.3±2.6ml/h at control to 0.9±2.0ml/h and 1.8±2.3ml/h respectively at 5g/L concentration of vanillin and syringaldehyde (Table 2). Lag phases continuously increased with increase in the concentration of phenolic compounds and reached up to 24.6±1.3h and 22.2±1.4h at 5g/L vanillin and syringaldehyde corresponding to lower hydrogen yields. Hydrogen content ranged from 38% to 65% in gas composition in experimental batches supplemented with phenolic compounds. The remaining portion of gas mainly consisted of CO2 while no methane was detected in gas samples. Inhibition coefficients of furan derivatives and phenolics compounds were estimated using Eq. (2) (Table 2). With an increase in inhibitor concentration from 0.25g/L to 5g/L, the increase in inhibition coefficient was from nil to 48.6%, from nil to 60.5%, from 14.3 to 94.67% and from 6.67 to 89.6% respectively for furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, vanillin, and syringaldehyde. The results indicate clearly that phenolics caused stronger inhibition of hydrogen production as compare to furan derivatives. Furfural and 5-HMF addition resulted in an average decrease of 26.99% and 37.16% in hydrogen yield respectively, while vanillin and syringaldehyde resulted in 49.40% and 42.26% decrease in hydrogen yield. Compared to furan derivatives, phenolic compounds caused higher decrease of cumulative hydrogen production, maximum hydrogen production rate, and hydrogen yield. Accordingly, lag phase time of hydrogen production prolonged more with phenolic compounds as compare to furan derivatives. The difference in inhibition potentials of furan derivatives and phenolic compounds were due to their different chemical properties (Table 1). The detrimental effect of furan derivatives on microorganisms was due to inhibition of cell growth, DNA damage and inhibition of several enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. Phenolic compounds caused alternations of membrane permeability of microorganisms, resulting in leakage of intracellular components and essential enzymatic systems inactivation (Monlau et al., 2014). Both furan derivative and phenolic compounds generate reactive oxygen species such as H2O2, OH- and O2, which affect cell metabolism and induce apoptosis (Ibraheem and Ndimba, 2013)."
11,Effect of inhibitors on COD removal,"3.3 Effect of inhibitors on COD removal The effect of the individual inhibitor on COD removal is shown in table 3 . COD removal efficiency increased slightly from 36.4±5.2% at control to 41.9±3.4% and 44.0±4.3% at 0.25g/L furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural respectively. Further increase in furan derivatives caused a reduction in COD removal efficiency. Phenolic compounds addition resulted in the continuous decrease in COD removal efficiency at every concentration of vanillin and syringaldehyde (table 3). Vanillin caused more inhibition of COD removal efficiency as compare to syringaldehyde due to its lower molecular weight. Vanillin could diffuse more readily into the cell of hydrogen producing bacteria and caused severe inhibition of substrate assimilation. Several studies have suggested that low molecular weight phenolics promote loss of cell membrane integrity, and thus affect their ability to be selective barriers and enzyme matrices, causing reduced cell growth and further reduced sugar assimilation (Behera et al., 2014; Campos et al., 2009; Nogueira et al., 2008; Cortez and Roberto, 2010). The contribution of different fractions of OFMSW for hydrogen production in terms of carbohydrate, lipid, and protein was estimated on the basis of COD removal (Tawfik and El-Qelish, 2012). The largest portion was contributed by carbohydrate while lipids and proteins contributed smaller fractions (table 3). Carbohydrates contributed 62.6 % to 79.6% in COD removal and hydrogen production, while contributions of proteins and lipids were 3.7 to 9.8 % and 14.8 to 28.0% respectively. Tawfik and El-Qelish (2012), observed that lipids and proteins contributed 23.3% and 4.1% respectively for hydrogen production. In addition, it was reported by Lay (2003), that hydrogen yield from carbohydrate-rich waste was 20 times greater than fat-rich and protein-rich wastes. The reason of greater hydrogen production from carbohydrate fraction is that anaerobic bacteria can utilize carbon fraction 25–30 times higher as compare to nitrogen fraction (Sreelaor et al., 2011)."
12,Inhibitors degradation,"3.4 Inhibitors degradation Furan derivatives and phenolic compounds affect the metabolism of microorganisms. Microbes release inhibitory stresses by converting these chemicals into less inhibitory by-products as long as their concentrations are below a threshold inhibitory level (Boopathy et al., 1993). Fig. 2 shows degradation level of furan and phenolic compounds during fermentation. The results indicate that hydrogen producing microbes could degrade low molecular weight inhibitors more efficiently. Furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural were completely degraded up to concentrations of 1g/L. However, higher concentration resulted in reduced degradation of furan derivatives. Vanillin and syringaldehyde were degraded completely up to 0.5g/L concentration. Further increase in their concentrations resulted in reduced degradation. The difference in degradation characteristic of inhibitors was caused by their intrinsic properties, which resulted in different diffusion rates as well as conversion mechanisms. Low molecular weight furan derivatives showed better diffusion efficiency as compare to high molecular weight phenolic compounds. Therefore, furan derivatives degraded rapidly as compared to phenolic compounds. The inhibitor degradation products have been suggested to be the corresponding alcohols in fermentation (Behera et al., 2014). The inhibitor reduction was attributed to NADH coupled reductive enzymes in bacteria. Ask et al. (2013), observed a significantly lower reductive power of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in presence of furan derivatives as compare to without inhibitors. When furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural were added simultaneously to the culture, a decrease in the intracellular level of dry weight NADH from 0.48 to 0.20µmol/g was observed. Thus, inhibitor addition reduced the level of NADH available for H2 formation, resulting in decreased H2 production."
13,Volatile fatty acids,"3.5 Volatile fatty acids Hydrogen production is associated with volatile fatty acids during anaerobic digestion. Therefore analysis of volatile fatty acids and distribution of their concentrations is an important indicator for hydrogen production monitoring. The effect of different concentrations of inhibitors on volatile fatty acid generation is shown in fig. 3 . Inhibitors addition lowered volatile fatty acids production, correspondingly low hydrogen yield. Acetate and butyrate were present in all the experimental batches, while lactate and propionate were negligible. For hydrogen production acetate and butyrate are the desirable soluble products because hydrogenogenic metabolic pathway occurs via those reaction routes [Elbeshbishy et al., 2011; Yeh et al., 1998]. Similarly, Fangkum and Reungsang (2011) observed that the dominant soluble metabolites were butyrate followed by acetate when hydrogen was produced from xylose-rich sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate with elephant dung having high HBu/ TVFAs ratio of 0.85 to 0.93. Quemeneur et al. (2012), observed high HBu/TVFAs ratio of 49.7% in anaerobic mixed cultures using xylose as a carbon source during hydrogen production as compare to 33.3% HAc/TVFAs in control. As shown in Fig.3(a), with an increase in furfural concentration from nil to 0.25g/L resulted in slight increase in butyrate and acetate concentrations from 3.71±1.2g/L to 3.76±2.1g/L and 2.68±1.6g/L to 3.10±1.7g/L respectively. 5-HMF increased butyrate and acetate concentrations from 3.71±1.2g/L to 3.75±1.9g/L and 2.68±1.6g/L to 2.97±1.5g/L respectively (fig.3b). However, a further increase in furfural and 5-HMF concentration declined VFAs production resulting in low hydrogen production. Vanillin and syringaldehyde addition lowered volatile fatty acid generation at every concentration (Fig.3c and d). VFAs production was inhibited more for phenolic compound addition as compare to furan derivatives. The difference in volatile fatty acid production under different concentration of inhibitors suggests that the metabolic pathways of the fermentative biomass may have shifted. The fermentation process which produces hydrogen is affected thermodynamically by the accumulation or lack of volatile fatty acids in the solution (Mizuno et al., 2000). Therefore, volatile fatty acids fluctuations in the experimental batches were likely due to the influence of inhibitors on hydrogen production."
14,Conclusion,"Hydrogen production was affected by the addition of furan derivatives and phenolic compounds. A lower concentration of furfural and 5-HMF (< 0.25g/L) exhibited a slight increase in hydrogen production. However, higher concentrations exhibited inhibitory effects. Phenolic compounds were inhibitory at every concentration applied. Inhibition coefficients of phenolic compounds were higher than those of furan derivatives. Vanillin exhibited maximum inhibition correspondingly lowest hydrogen yield among all inhibitors. Furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural were completely degraded up to concentrations of 1g/L, while vanillin and syringaldehyde were degraded completely up to the concentration of 0.5g/L"
