0,Introduction,"The growing energy demands and environmental concerns related to fossil fuels have stimulated the development of renewable energy. 1 , 2 According to BP Energy, the electricity generated from renewable sources accounts for 9.3% of the world’s total power generation and this proportion could grow to 29% in 20 years. 3 , 4 To achieve this goal, the intermittency nature of renewable energy and its incompatibility with the power grid have to be addressed, which require the advances of energy conversion and storage technologies. 5–7 Electrocatalytic water splitting to produce hydrogen fuel through H2 evolution reaction (HER) is one of such technologies that can convert the intermittent power produced from renewable sources like solar and wind into stable chemical energy. 1 , 6 , 8 However, in the traditional water splitting process, the HER is accompanied by O2 evolution reaction (OER), which is kinetically sluggish and would take place at theoretical potential of 1.23 ​V under standard conditions (Fig. 1 a). 9 Moreover, although proton exchange membrane (PEM) such as Nafion and diaphragm are adopted to separate H2 and O2 products in traditional electrolyzers under acidic and alkaline solution respectively, the formation of explosive H2/O2 mixtures cannot be fully avoided due to the so-called crossover effect. 10 , 11 What’s worse, the reactive oxygen species produced at anode will degrade the PEM during electrolysis process, 12 thereby accelerating the production of explosive mixture and shortening the lifetime of PEMs as well. To tackle these challenges, hybrid water electrolysis, a strategy in which OER is substituted with a certain alternative oxidation reaction, has been developed and receiving growing research interest (Fig. 1b). The hybrid water electrolysis system is somewhat similar to the electrolytic cell in the chlor-alkali industry, where HER takes place at the cathode and chlorine evolution reaction at the anode. 13 There have been reported many reactions, like alcohol oxidation, 14 , 15 aldehyde oxidation, 16 , 17 , amine oxidation, 18 urea oxidation, 19–23 hydrazine oxidation, 22–26 etc., adequate or potentially adequate to serve as anode oxidation reaction that can replace OER. All these reactions can reduce the overall energy input for H2 generation due to their more favorable thermodynamics than OER and increase the security of the water splitting system. In this paper, we aim to provide an overview of this booming area (see Fig. 2 ), including the selection of substrates at anode, the catalyst design and the underlying oxidation mechanism, and the electrolyzer design. In the reaction choosing part, we category the alternative oxidation reactions based on the functionalities of alternative substrates rather than their chemical structures. In this way, the reported oxidation reactions are divided into three groups: the reagent-sacrificing type that allows the reduction of electricity consumption during H2 production, 22–31 the pollutant-degrading type wherein environmental pollutants are used as substrates, 20–23 , 32–36 and the value-added type that produces valuable products at the anode. 14–16 , 18 , 37–44 In the catalyst design part, we focus the discussion on anode catalysts only, because the catalysts for the cathodic HER have been extensively reviewed. 45 , 46 In addition to traditional design strategies like microstructure regulation and composition tuning, we also highlight the decisive role of catalyst reconstruction, by giving a description on the discovery of this phenomenon, the mechanism behind it and catalyst design based on these discoveries. In the third part, innovative electrolyzers including membrane-free electrolyzer 47 and asymmetric-electrolyte electrolyzer 28 , 48 are also discussed briefly. Finally, we point out the challenges and perspectives in this field for future hydrogen economy."
1,Reaction choosing,
2,Reagent-sacrificing type,"2.1 Reagent-sacrificing type When an anode reaction can replace OER but converts the valuable substrate to a worthless product, the substrate of this reaction can be regarded as a sacrificial reagent and we define the reaction as the reagent-sacrificing type. Although the cost may increase due to the sacrifice of substrates, the electricity input of this type of reaction can be reduced indeed. Some typical reactions and recent works (Table 1 ) of this type are listed below. Reactions: (1) N2H4+4OH−→N2+4H2O+4e− (2) 2NH3+6OH−→N2+6H2O+6e− Hydrazine oxidation is a typical example of the reagent-sacrificing type (Equation (1)). The thermodynamic potential of this reaction is −0.38 ​V, far lower than that of OER (1.23 ​V) under standard conditions, and therefore the overall potential of water splitting for H2 generation can be reduced significantly. With this hydrazine oxidation as anode reaction, a current density of up to 500 ​mA ​cm−2 can be realized within cell voltage of 1 ​V without O2 generation. 24–27 Moreover, 10 ​mA ​cm−2 can be achieved at micro voltage level. 27 , 30 An impressive work on the application of hydrazine oxidation reaction for hybrid water electrolysis comes from Ding’s group (Fig. 3 a). 26 In this work, Fe-doped CoS2 nanosheets with standard cubic CoS2 structure (Fig. 3b) and ultrathin thickness of 1.22 ​± ​0.03 ​nm (Fig. 3c) were synthesized through precipitation method. This Fe-doped CoS2 nanosheets catalyst exhibited activities superior to Pt/C for catalyzing both cathodic HER (Fig. 3d) and anodic hydrazine oxidation reaction (Fig. 3e). The self-powered H2 production system (Fig. 3a) constructed by integrating a direct hydrazine fuel cell and a hybrid electrolysis unit, both of which used Fe-doped CoS2 nanosheets as catalyst exhibited a H2 evolution rate of 9.95 ​mmol ​h−1, a 98% Faradaic efficiency and a 40-h stability (Fig. 3f). This innovative self-powered H2 production strategy was inherited and promoted by Zhang and his colleagues. 27 Very recently, they synthesized a P, W co-doped Co3N nanowire array electrode and employed it to catalyze HER and hydrazine oxidation. The two-electrode system could deliver a current density of 10 ​mA ​cm−2 under a cell voltage of 28 ​mV, and the self-powered H2 production system could achieve a decent H2 evolution rate of 1.25 ​mmol ​h−1 ​at room temperature. Another example of reagent-sacrificing type is ammonia oxidation. Similar to hydrazine oxidation, the oxidation of ammonia (Equation (2)) is also thermodynamic more favorable than OER, so that the required energy input is also much lower than that for traditional water electrolysis. Compared to hydrazine, ammonia is more common, non-toxic and easy to prepare, therefore shows greater promise in replacing OER. Although Pt has been identified as the most suitable catalyst for ammonia oxidation, 29 its scarcity and high cost have stimulated the development of non-noble metal-based anode. Recently, Mei et al. reported a catalyst of N-doped NiZnCu layered double hydroxides (LDH) with reduced graphene oxide on nickel foam (N-LDH/rGO) (see Fig. 4 a). 30 This catalyst was prepared through a hydrothermal method followed by calcination under NH3 flow gas. The two-electrode system employing the prepared NiZnCu LDH as both anode and cathode can obtain a current density of 50 ​mA ​cm−2 under 0.769 ​V, which was 0.170 ​V lower than the noble-metal system where Pt/C served as cathode and IrO2 served as anode (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, this two-electrode system could maintain the current density for at least 18 ​h (Fig. 4c). In general, notwithstanding the extra cost caused by the consumption of sacrificial reagent, the ultra-low energy input guarantees the stable operation of water electrolysis under high current density with no O2 production, making this type an ideal option for hybrid water electrolysis. Also, hydrazine and ammonia can be regarded as hydrogen carriers so that this type of reaction can work in the hydrogen storage system."
3,Pollutant-degrading type,"2.2 Pollutant-degrading type The introduction of sacrificial reagents more or less increases the cost of the entire system even if the cell voltage can be reduced. Alternative substrates could be environmental pollutants, which can be oxidatively degraded. This anode oxidation is similar to the process in waste treatment and we call it the pollutant-degrading type when integrating with water electrolysis. Some representative reactions and examples of this type are showed below. Reactions: (3) CO(NH2)2+6OH− →N2 ​+ ​5H2O ​+ ​CO2 ​+ ​6e− (4) S2− → S+2e− Urea is widely present in domestic sewage, nitrogenous fertilizer and waste water from urea synthesis, and, though constitutes only a small part of wastewater, is largely responsible for eutrophication. 53 Therefore, oxidative degradation of urea (Equation (3)) is extensively studied (Table 2 ). Many of these studies have reported the similar onset potential of about 1.3 ​V vs RHE, despite the theoretical value of only 0.37 ​V. This phenomenon can be partially explained by the reaction’s sluggish kinetics owing to a 6e− transfer process, yet it is still confusing why the overpotentials of diverse catalysts are so close. This issue will be discussed in Section 3. Another typical pollutant in wastewater is organic dye. The effluents of textile, cosmetic, paper, leather and light-harvesting arrays industries include large amounts of dyes, which will affect the esthetic merit, gas solubility and transparency of water. 54 Taking methylene blue as a model dye, Hu’s group investigated the couple of HER and organic pollutant decomposition (Fig. 5 a). 55 In this work, they coated the FeNiP nanosheets with a carbon shell through carbonization of glucose and used this material as the cathode catalyst. As for anode reactions, considering the poor resistance of metal-based compounds to the acidic oxidative condition, they chose graphite rod as the anode electrode. As Fig. 5b shows, the oxidation was observed at about 1.2 ​V for different concentrations of methylene blue. Thanks to the superior protection and conductivity provided by the carbon shell, the catalyst showed an overpotential of 104 ​mV to afford a current density of 10 ​mA ​cm−2 (Fig. 5b), which could be maintained even after 1000 cycles of CV scans (Fig. 5c). Besides, under a constant current density of 1 ​mA ​cm−2, the complete decomposition of methylene blue can be achieved in 53 ​min (Fig. 5e), during which the corresponding potential remained stable for over 2500 ​s (Fig. 5f). Besides wastewater, exhaust gas treatment can also be coupled into hybrid water electrolysis systems, such as H2S, which is hard to harness due to its acidity and toxicity. Taking S2− oxidation as alternative anode reaction can reduce not only the overall energy input of electrolysis systems but the cost of industrial waste gas treatment. However, bare metals are easily etched or poisoned by S2− ions, causing substantial decreases in the activity and stability of catalysts, and thus impedes the industrial application of such a technology. To increase the stability of electrolytic systems, Bao’s group adopted the strategy of encapsulating CoNi nanoalloy into nitrogen-doped graphene to form CoNi@NGs for the use of catalyzing H2S oxidation. 36 Considering the fact that H2S can react with alkaline electrolyte (NaOH) to form Na2S and the toxicity of H2S, they firstly used Na2S as an analogue to mimic H2S oxidation in alkaline solution (Fig. 6 a–c). As a result, this optimized catalyst could drive the anode reaction at an onset potential of 0.25 ​V vs RHE, which was 1.24 ​V lower than that required for water oxidation reaction (Fig. 6a). In addition, control experiments demonstrated that CoNi@NGs outperformed all of the selected competitors and delivered a current density twice larger than Pt/C (Fig. 6b). This improvement can be attributed to its low charge transfer resistance (Fig. 6c) and near thermo-neutral adsorption of sulfur with ΔG S∗ ​= ​−0.29 ​eV (Fig. 6d). Besides the superb activity, this catalyst also showed long-term durability under these analogous experimental conditions, benefiting from the protection of N-doped graphene at outer shell. In order to further verify the effectiveness of CoNi@NGs for hybrid water electrolysis in a realistic system involving the oxidation of H2S waste to generate H2, Bao’s group then conducted a demo experiment to remove the H2S in the simulated industrial syngas (49% CO, 49% H2 and 2% H2S), confirming the high response current of CoNi@NGs after introducing 2% H2S/syngas (Fig. 6e), in contrast to the no response current for syngas without H2S at a wide potential, and the onset potential much lower than OER (1.24 ​V). In addition to its high activity and selectivity, CoNi@NG electrocatalyst also has excellent stability of over 1200 ​h (Fig. 6f). As environmental pollution is getting serious continuously, waste treatment has almost become a matter of life and death. The couple of HER and pollutant degradation undoubtedly shows promising future. Since the pollutants in real world are much more complicated, more research efforts should be made aiming at realizing effective hybrid electrolysis under practical conditions."
4,Value-added type,"2.3 Value-added type High cost is currently a major obstacle to the development of electrolysis. 56 An ideal hybrid system should couple a value-added oxidation reaction with HER, such that the gross benefits of electrolytic systems can be largely increased due to the return at both cathode and anode and the decreased electricity inputs. Accordingly, the value-added type comes up. Reactions and related works are listed below. Reactions: Image 2 One of the most important technical routes of this type is to oxidize biomass at the anode. Oxidation refining is pivotal when upgrading biomass-derived feedstocks to valuable chemicals like polymers and pharmaceuticals, 59 , 60 among which room-temperature electro-oxidation can be exempt from the reliance on elevated temperature, high-pressure and additional chemical oxidants such as O2 and KMnO4 (see Table 3). A representative reaction is the oxidative transformation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2, 5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) (Equation (7)), one of the most promising monomers for the production of green polymers. 60 Sun’s group has reported a few pioneering works in this field. 14 , 17 , 37 , 41 One typical work 41 concerned a bifunctional catalyst based on 3D Ni2P nanoparticle arrays on Ni foam (Ni2P NPA/NF) which showed excellent performance on both HMF oxidation reaction and HER. Upon the addition of HMF, the anodic onset potential decreased from beyond 1.50 ​V–~1.35 ​V vs. RHE (see Fig. 7 a), and only a small change in cathodic HER potential (see Figs. 7b and 9 mV to reach the same current density of 10 ​mA ​cm−2) was observed. On the other hand, this bifunctional catalyst was also proved to have a Faradaic efficiency of near 100% for converting HMF to FDCA (Fig. 7c). They further compared the catalysts before and after HMF oxidation and found the Ni species were oxidized in situ. These oxidized species were concluded to be the real catalytically active sites for HMF oxidation. Although FDCA holds promising utilizations, the mass production of its raw material HMF remains an economical challenge. Alternatively, furfural is another platform chemical that has been industrially produced. However, as a mono-functional compound, furfural needs further processing to add a functional group to expand its potential application scale. 61 Choi and her colleagues succeeded in finding an oxidation reaction of furfural into maleic acid and then coupled it with HER (Fig. 8 a). 43 The reaction was realized by using a H2SO4 solution (pH ​= ​1) containing 10 ​mM furfural as reactant. And by using PbO2 as anodic catalyst, the reaction can have lower onset potential than OER (Fig. 8b) to fulfill the requirement of forming a hybrid water electrolysis system with HER. Further oxidation experiments under constant 2.0 ​V vs. RHE revealed the yield of maleic acid could reach 65.1% with 2-furanol as an intermediate at 250 ​C charge passed (Fig. 8c). However, it should be noted that the activity of the selected catalyst (PbO2) is unsatisfactory, and this technical route is not quite competitive due to the stoichiometric CO2 production. Very recently, Yu’s group developed another route by coupling HER with glucaric acid (GRA) production. 58 Glucaric acid is also a platform chemical that can be developed into biodegradable polymers, detergents, and metal complexation agents. 62 , 63 The mild reaction condition renders the electro-oxidation of glucose for glucaric acid production highly selective and exempts C–C bond from cleavage. Therefore, it’s quite attractive to couple HER with the electro-oxidation of glucose. In Yu’s work, two nanostructured NiFe compounds, i.e. FeNiO x and FeNiN x (see Fig. 9a) both synthesized from NiFe layered double hydroxide nanosheet arrays, were found highly active and selective in electro-catalyzing anodic glucose oxidation, and in which, FeNiO x outperformed FeNiN x and presented a current density of 87.6 ​mA ​cm−2 ​at a potential of 1.30 V vs. RHE (Fig. 9b). The result of chronoamperometric measurements of glucose oxidation revealed that the glucaric acid yield could reach up to 83% (Fig. 9c). Dehydrogenation is another form of oxidation reaction that can also take place at the anode to produce fine chemicals like pharmaceuticals. 18 , 42 One of the representative works related to dehydrogenation was the realization of semi-dehydrogenation of tetrahydroisoquinolines and the corresponding hybrid water electrolysis. 42 As shown in Equation (9), the product of this reaction is dihydroisoquinoline, a potential drug that is anti-tumor, anti-fungal, vasodilatory and can inhibit nonaminox. Dihydroisoquinoline is hard to obtain via traditional synthetic strategies because tetrahydroisoquinoline is usually dehydrogenated completely into quinoline. But upon the application of Ni2P||Ni2P electrolyzer, which employed Ni2P as a bifunctional catalyst for both cathodic HER and anodic dehydrogenation, the electrocatalytic semi-dehydrogenation of tetrahydroisoquinolines could present a current density of 20 ​mA ​cm−1 at a voltage of ~1.5 ​V (Fig. 10 a), and also a good long-term stability, as no apparent decrease of the Faradaic efficiency for generating H2 and tetrahydroisoquinoline (see Fig. 10b, nearly 100% and 96% respectively) was observed after six cycles of electrolysis at 1.50 ​V vs. counter electrode. We will discuss in Section 3 the mechanism of this semi-dehydrogenation reaction. Since cost and profit is the most powerful driving force for the continuous research endeavors upon hybrid water electrolysis, the value-added typed reactions may be the most promising among the three types for practical application."
5,Catalyst design,"Compared to traditional water electrolysis, hybrid water electrolysis systems are much more complicated because the intermediates, active sites of catalysts can change with the substrate. Therefore, the mechanism and theoretical guidance on catalyst design are vital, but currently the relevant investigation is still lacking. Among them, the reconstruction phenomenon, which means oxidation of the catalysts under anodic potential, has been found common in both traditional and hybrid water electrolysis. Considering the decisive role of this phenomenon, this section will be divided into two parts: Structure-stable Catalysts and Reconstructed Catalysts."
6,Structure-stable catalysts,"3.1 Structure-stable catalysts Since most non-oxide-based catalysts are found to be transformed into the corresponding oxides or oxyhydroxides under reaction conditions, these oxides or oxyhydroxides catalysts are considered as “stable”. Due to their semi-conductive properties, many strategies have been developed to improve their electrical conductivities, plus exposure of active site and facilitation of mass transfer. Microstructure regulation is one of the most studied strategies. For example, oxides with 1D, 15 , 21 2D 16 , 20 , 33 , 38 and 3D 52 morphologies have been explored for hybrid water electrolysis. However, most of non-noble metal catalysts underperformed relative to the noble metal benchmark (Pt/C) before Qiao’s group reported the 2D MnO2 with uniform lateral sizes. 20 In this work, they developed a method to sieve the lateral sizes of 2D MnO2. In a typical procedure, they first synthesized 2D MnO2 with sizes ranging from tens of nanometers to several micrometers through the redox reaction between potassium permanganate (KMnO4) and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). By virtue of the water molecules absorbed at both the basal planes and edge sites, these 2D nanolayers can be dispersed in water to form a stable colloidal dispersion. They then added a certain amount (pre-determined by conditions optimization experiment) of 1 ​M HCl into the dispersion and, after precipitation, obtained two 2D MnO2 samples in which one has the particle lateral sizes ranging from 50 to 200 ​nm (Fig. 11 a, denoted as S–MnO2) and the other has the particle lateral sizes distributed between 500 ​nm and several microns (Fig. 11b, denoted as L-MnO2). Electrocatalysts prepared by incorporating 2D MnO2 into (3D) graphene–nickel foam hybrid films could deliver the current density of 10 ​mA ​cm−2 at potentials (see Fig 11c and 1.33 ​V vs. RHE for S–MnO2 and 1.37 ​V for L-MnO2) lower than Pt/C benchmark (1.48 ​V) for anodic urea oxidation. Another powerful tool to promote catalysts’ performance is to tailor the electronic structure by introducing other elements or vacancy. This method can improve the conductivity and modulate the adsorption energy of intermediates for enhanced activity. Ni–Mo based, 21 Ni–Fe based, 23 , 58 Co–Cu based, 40 Co–Fe based 26 and even Fe–Co–Ni based 38 catalysts have all been reported for hybrid water electrolysis. They usually perform better than single-metal compounds synthesized by similar ways. Moreover, non-metal elements have also been introduced to modify the catalysts’ electronic structures. For example, Wang et al. reported the incorporation of fluorine (F) into β-FeOOH electrode 15 realized by a so-called “ionic-liquids synthesis” method, which required the immersion of β-FeOOH in the 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate and long-term agitation. The introduction of F resulted in elevated valence states of Fe atoms, so that Fe might be oxidized more easily, which could be critical in catalyzing ethanol oxidation. As the LSV curves showed (Fig. 12 c), F-modified β-FeOOH required 1.207 ​V (vs. RHE) to drive 10 ​mA ​cm−2, ~30 ​mV lower than pure β-FeOOH."
7,Reconstructed catalysts,"3.2 Reconstructed catalysts According to literature related to urea oxidation, 20–33 we have found that almost all the reported onset potentials for urea oxidation are around 1.30 ​V. What’s more, this phenomenon does not seem to be specific to urea: all the reported onset potentials using Ni-based catalysts for the oxidation of alcohol, 14 , 15 HMF, 16 , 17 , 37 amines 18 and tetra-hydroisoquinolines 42 in alkaline conditions are also very close to this value. Sun’s group firstly explored this “curse”. Actually, before their study on hybrid water electrolysis, Sun et al. noticed that transition metal sulfides and phosphides were oxidized during water oxidation, 64 , 65 which were then denoted as “reconstruction”. Later, during the study of hybrid water electrolysis over the Ni2P, Ni3S2 and metallic Ni catalyst, they observed the same phenomenon. 14 , 17 , 41 For example, hierarchical porous Ni 14 was observed to have an increased O content according to elemental mapping results after catalyzing benzyl alcohol oxidation. In addition, Ni 2p3/2 XPS spectra showed a decreased peak at 852.6 ​eV ascribed to metallic Ni and an increased peak at 856.0 ​eV attributed to oxidized Ni species after catalysis (Fig. 13 a). Based on the enhanced peak intensity of O 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 13b), Sun’s group concluded that the catalyst was oxidized during the catalysis process. Further, they investigated the electronic effect on the electrocatalytic activity. 14 By replacing the substrate with its derivatives that have electron-withdrawing (4-nitrobenzyl alcohol, NBA) and -donating (4-methylbenzyl alcohol, MBA) substituents on the benzene ring (Fig. 13c), they got quite similar LSV curves (Fig. 13d). The negligible electronic effect implied that the catalytic onset potential of these three alcohol oxidations is probably determined by the desired oxidation state of the electrocatalyst, rather than their intrinsic thermodynamics. Zhang’s group delved deeper into the role of reconstruction. 18 , 42 In the work of semi dehydrogenation of tetrahydroisoquinolines over Ni2P mentioned in Section 2.3, they measured the potential-dependent in situ Raman spectra. 42 As shown in Fig. 14 a, when tetrahydroisoquinolines were absent, two peaks, attributed to the Ni–O vibrations of NiOOH started to appear at 472 and 553 ​cm−1, and their intensity increased gradually with the potentials. But the same peaks were not observed for the electrolytic cell with the substrate (Fig. 14b). Further, they combined the potential-dependent in situ Raman spectra with chronoamperometry (I-t) test. At the very beginning, the measurement was conducted without the substrate and the peaks of NiOOH appeared as expected. Then the substrate was added, and those peaks declined gradually and disappeared in 20 ​s (Fig. 14c). These phenomena implied that the catalyst might work as a mediator ( Fig. 14d): the catalyst firstly donated electrons to the electric circuit and became oxidized species; then the oxidized species captured the electrons from substrate and recover to the reduced state. Based on these findings, we can conclude that the rate-determining step of the reaction mentioned above is the oxidation of the reconstructed catalysts to high valence states. Since the reconstruction process is critical for many oxidation reactions, catalyst design to promote this process will undoubtedly benefit the overall catalysis. Song’s group reported the utilization of vacancy engineering to achieve this goal. 66 By controlling the crystal growth rate, they synthesized the Ni(OH)2 with different Ni vacancy concentrations (Fig. 15 a-c). Interestingly, they found the catalyst with higher vacancy concentration showed boosted catalytic performance and stronger peaks for Ni2+/Ni3+ oxidation (Fig. 15d and e), which can be explained by the easier formation of active NiOOH species. DFT calculation further revealed that the increase of Ni vacancy concentration would lead to a higher density of states near the Fermi level (Fig. 15f and g), which will promote the charge transfer and therefore accelerate the catalyst reconstruction. The relationship between catalysts’ electronic structure and reconstruction is also one of the research hotspots in traditional water splitting. For example, Shen et al. 67 have found that the cobalt site with a higher valence state tended to reconstruct more easily. The previous findings in traditional water splitting will inspire the research on hybrid water electrolysis a lot. However, despite the progresses that have been made, deeper and systematic understanding in this phenomenon is still needed. For example, many reactions have to be conducted after the catalyst reconstruction, while hydrazine oxidation seems to be an exception. It’s confusing why only some of them have to experience such a process. In addition, the current promotions of reconstruction seem to be kinetic improvements rather than thermodynamic ones. How to promote this process thermodynamically remains a question."
8,Electrolyzer design,"When assembling electrolysis devices for practical applications, ion transportation, overall efficiency and maintenance cost have to be considered. Therefore, electrolyzer design is also of great importance. Different from traditional water electrolysis, the anode reaction of hybrid electrolysis is often an organic oxidation, which requires different electrolyzers. The first studied electrolyzer is the membrane-free electrolyzer. In a typical water electrolysis system, hydrogen is generated from the cathode while oxygen is produced from anode. The mixture of these two gases is explosive therefore ion exchange membranes are needed, which separate the gases but permit the transport of ions. However, the membranes are either too expensive or not stable enough, which impedes the large-scale commercialization of water electrolysis. 12 This problem may be solved by introducing a nongaseous reaction at the anode. Following this idea, Geng et al. integrated the benzyl alcohol oxidation and HER to assemble a membrane-free electrolyzer (Fig. 16 a). 47 Their cell voltages were 1.40, 1.45, and 1.53 ​V to deliver the benchmark current densities of 20, 50, and 100 ​mA ​cm−2 respectively and showed negligible variations in 15-h test. Since many reactions are gas-free, this strategy can also be generalized to other reactions. Since the thermodynamic potential of water oxidation is 1.23 ​V, there is still a risk of explosive mixtures formation, and further enhancement on the activity of catalysts is required. Another innovative electrolyzer is the asymmetric-electrolyte electrolyzer (Fig. 16b). In recent years, bipolar membranes have been introduced to energy-related electrolyzers. 68 It consists of a negatively charged cation exchange layer (CEL), which is selective for the transport of cations only, and a positively charged anion exchange layer (AEL) for anions only. 69 With the help of bipolar membrane, the electrolyzer is separated into an acidic cathode part and an alkaline anode part. In this way, the pH gradient between two parts will facilitate the respective reaction thermodynamically. Wen and coworkers reported a series of works based on this technology. 28 , 48 They could reach a current density of 10 ​mA ​cm−2 with a rather low applied voltage of 0.54 ​V for the couple of HER and urea oxidation. As for the couple of HER and hydrazine oxidation, the device did not need energy input anymore and could deliver a power output of 13.3 ​mW ​cm−2 ​at a current density of 54.7 ​mA ​cm−2 and produce H2 at the same time. However, the high price of bipolar membranes would also increase the overall cost."
9,Summary and perspectives,"By replacing the OER with an alternative reaction, hybrid water electrolysis offers a pathway to safer, more energy efficient and more profitable hydrogen production. In this review, we have summarized the reported alternative reactions into three types, whose substrates are sacrificial reagents, pollutants and primary chemicals respectively. Although the reactions can be various and complicated, some strategies on catalyst design like morphology and composition tuning may be widely applicable. In particular, we placed the catalyst reconstruction in a key position, including its discovery, the underlying mechanism and the method to promote it. This process may be the potential determining step for many reactions yet our understanding is far from enough. Finally, electrolyzers without membrane and with bipolar membrane are introduced separately, which can either reduce costs or reduce energy input. Despite many achievements that have been made, the development of hybrid water electrolysis is still in the early stage and need further exploration. (1) For reaction choosing, despite the required potential, added value and application scale that have been studied widely, many factors have to be considered, 2 such as product separation and purification, membrane degradation etc. More techno-economic analysis should be conducted. (2) Our understanding on catalyst reconstruction is still not enough. What kind of reactions can be conducted before reconstruction? How to activate the catalysts under lower potentials? If the activation potential can drop far below 1.23 ​V, the OER can be suppressed completely and membrane-free electrolyzer can be popularized, which will push the hybrid electrolysis forward to practical utilization. (3) Presently, most researches about hybrid electrolysis explore anodic and cathodic reactions separately. But the replacement of anode reaction often requires the change of substrates, which will inevitably diffuse to the cathode area. Hence the interaction between the two reactions may exist and need further study. With the advances of material synthesis, characterization, calculation and electrolytic system design, we believe this burgeoning field will certainly move forward, and hybrid water electrolysis will eventually come into practical application and inspires the community to explore similar hybrid CO2 reduction and N2 fixation. 70"
