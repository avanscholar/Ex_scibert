0,Introduction,"Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) are one of the most attracted catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction [1–5]. Metallic structure (1 T) of these materials has interesting optical and electrical properties, so many works are attempting to obtain single layer metallic 1 T structure by the mechanical or chemical exfoliation and some complicated routes such as exerting strain at the meantime of achieving the enlarged surface area and new catalytically active sites [6–10]. The 1 T phase possesses a higher conduction band level and so higher reductive potential for hydrogen evolution reaction. The 1 T phase also shows higher electrical conduction and narrower bandgap compared with the semiconducting (2 H) phase. Thus, the 1 T structure has a remarkable advantage in both photocatalysis and electrocatalysis for hydrogen evolution reaction compared to the 2H structure [6,11]. Following the successful history of transition metal sulfides in various applications, transition metal selenides are now the rising stars. In comparison with the Mo counterparts, W is more abundant in the Earth's crust and thus cheaper, and less toxic. Thus, WSe2has recently attracted considerable attention and becomes an emerging member of this TMD family [4]. The WSe2 synthesized by some chemical techniques including chemical vapor deposition [12,13] and solvothermal [14] usually were 2H structure. Some exfoliation methods also were inefficient to obtain 1 T-WSe2 nanosheet [10,15–18]. Besides, constructing hybrids of the semiconductor material with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) has been widely used to obtain materials displaying outstanding performances [1,19]. The RGO also is an ideal template to induce the formation of two-dimension materials. Up to date, the effect of some assemble techniques and template effect of graphene on the polymorph and hydrogen evolution catalysis of WSe2 are insufficiently explored. In this work, we present a facile one-step hydrothermal approach of assembling 1 TWSe2 nanosheets on RGO to obtain a highly efficient hydrogen evolution catalyst. Furthermore, doping Sn showed an efficient effect on enhancing hydrogen evolution catalytic activity of the WSe2 and MoS2/rGO hybrids."
1,Materials and methods,"The starting materials used in this work were all directly purchased from the chemical shops without further purification. First, a 10 ml W4+ aqueous solution with a concentration of 0.0620 mol./l was prepared with analytically pure ammonium paratungstate ((NH4)10(H2W12O42)·4H2O, Sinopharm chemical reagent Co., Ltd., China) and 10 ml deionized water. At the same time, a 10 ml W4+ graphene oxide (GO) aqueous solutions with a concentration of 0.060 mol./l and a GO/WSe2 mass ratio of ∼0.05 was prepared in 10 ml GO aqueous solution (1 mg/ml, Beijing Boyu high-tech new materials technology Co. Ltd., China). 2.5 ml HCl aqueous solution (37 %) was additionally used to reduce the GO to RGO and W6+ to W4+. Meanwhile, the analytically pure citric acid (C6H8O7, Tianjin Kemio chemical reagent Co., Ltd., China) (Citric acid to W4+ molar ration is 1.5) used as a chelating agent was added. Afterword, 5 ml Se2− aqueous solutions with a concentration of 0.24 mol./l were prepared by reacting analytically pure selenium powder (Tianjin kaitong chemical reagent Co., Ltd., Chian) and potassium borohydride (KH4B, Tianjin chemical reagent third factory, China) in 5 ml deionized water. The potassium borohydride to selenium molar ratio equalled to 1.5. Subsequently, W4+ cation solutions and Se2− aqueous solutions were mixed in 25 ml hydrothermal kettle. After stirring for 5 min, the kettle was sealed and undergone a hydrothermal treatment at 160 ℃for 24 h. When naturally cooled to room temperature, the products were collected by filtrating and washing with deionized water for several times. The samples were finally dried at 50 ℃ for 10 h. Using the same method, the Sn-doped samples were similarly prepared by replacing 1.0 mol.% of W4+ cation in the W4+ aqueous solution and W4+ graphene oxide aqueous solution by analytically pure stannous chloride (SnCl2 9H2O, Zhengzhou kaibang chemical product Co, Ltd., China). All samples were characterized by D/Max- 2200PC X-ray diffractometer (XRD, CuKα1, λ = 0.15406 nm), G2 F20 S-TWIN transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Renishaw-invia Raman spectrophotometer (Model no: Renishaw-invia, U.K.) at 532 nm, and FluoroMax-4 P fluorescence spectrometer. All samples also characterized by Vector-22 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Cary 5000 spectrophotometer, Axis Ultradld X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, RTS-9 4-point probes resistivity system, and DAT1100 dynamic absorption contact angle measuring instrument. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated in the solution of 5 ml ethanol as a sacrificial agent and 45 ml deionized water. The ethanol aqueous solution and 0.1 g catalyst were mixed in the 135 ml reaction cell. The cell was irradiated with a 250 W UV lamp under constant stirring at ∼25 ℃. The gas samples were periodically taken from the headspace of the cell and analyzed on GC-2014 gas chromatography for determination of the H2 gas yield. A YGCS multichannel electrochemical workstation was used for electrochemical measurement. The measurement was performed in a 0.5 M N2-saturated H2SO4 solution. A calomel electrode was used as the reference electrode. A Pt/C wire was utilized as the counter electrode. The catalyst sample coated on the graphite electrode (diameter: 5 mm) was utilized as the working electrode. The fabrication detail of the working electrode was mentioned below: 0.10 g catalyst was fully ground and mixed with 100 μL deionized water, 50 μL anhydrous alcohol, 100 μL isopropanol, and 50 μL Nafion solution (5 wt.%). The mixture was ultrasonically suspended to form a uniform and stable slurry. The slurry was then completely coated on the front end (12 mm length) of the ultrasonically cleaned graphite electrode. The efficient area of the electrode was ∼2.0 cm2. As prepared electrode finally underwent the 3 h drying of 80 ℃ to remove the organic solvents and make the catalyst more adhesive on the graphite electrode. The polarization characteristics were determined at a potential scanning rate of 10 mV/s from 0 to −0.65 V (vs SCE). The stability characteristics were determined in the H2SO4 at a scanning rate of 200 mV/s between 0 and −0.65 V (vs SCE) for 5000 cycles. The calibration of the SCE reference electrode on a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) was finished based on the following relationship: E(RHE)=E(SCE)+0.0591pH+0.24."
2,Results and discussion,"The TEM micrograph (Fig. 1 ) shows that the samples synthesized with and without RGO are of nanosheet morphology with a curled edge. The XRD analysis (Fig. 2 a) indicated that the nanostructures are composed of hexagonal WSe2 (JCPDS: 87-2418, a=b = 3.286 Ǻ, and c = 12.98 Ǻ). The Raman spectra of all the nanostructures synthesized in the present of citric acid and both citric acid and RGO (Fig. 2b) showed the four modes at 135, 189, 260 cm−1. These modes are similar with the 150.7 (J2), 211.4 (J3), 289 (E1 2g) cm−1 modes of 1 T-MoSe2 [11]. The generally reported mode at ∼245 cm−1 for 2H-WSe2 (E 1 2g) [14,20] does not appear. Such Raman mode configuration has not been reported for WSe2 in previous literature. The 135 mode was only reported for 1−5 L mechanical exfoliated WSe2 that was identified to be 1 T-phase [20]. Sokolikova et al. [21] reported that there is currently no information on the vibrational modes of the 1 Tʹ-phase of WSe2, although overall lower symmetry of the 1 Tʹ-phase suggests a wider set of the Raman active modes. They gave the experimental Raman modes at 104.5, 149, 177, 218, 236.3 and 258 cm−1 for the 1 Tʹ-phase of WSe2. The reported mode at 258 cm−1 is closed to the mode at 260 cm−1 in this work. The reported modes at 177 and 218 cm−1 are closed to the wide mode at 189 cm−1 in this work. 1 Tʹ-and 1 Tʹ-phases have similar lattice structure and thereby having similar Raman modes. It can be believed that the Raman mode can slightly shift because of the crystallinity that determines the lattice spacing and interatomic interaction. Thus, we may reasonably identify all the samples to be pure 1 T-phase. Moreover, the weak mode at 325 cm-1 corresponding to multilayer structure [20,12] appears for the WSe2 and WSe2: Sn nanostructures, but not for the RGO/WSe2 and RGO/WSe2: Sn nanostructures. This implies that RGO resulted in the transfer from a multilayer to a single layer. The WSe2 synthesized in the absence of citric acid and RGO showed a mode at 249 cm−1 corresponding to the E 1 2g mode of 2H-WSe2, whereas the two modes at 120 and 138 cm-1 ascribing to the J1 and J2 modes of 1 T-WSe2, and two unknown modes at 164 and 220 cm−1. Fig. 2b also shows the d-band at ∼1350 cm−1 and G-band at ∼1599 cm−1 for the RGO in the nanohybrids. The ratio of band intensity ratio (I D/I G) was estimated to be 1.625. This ratio value is larger than that of the graphene oxide (0.96 [22]). This reveals that the GO was well reduced to RGO [22]. The element chemical state and charge transfer between the RGO and WSe2 were investigated by XPS analyses. The survey spectrum of WSe2 and RGO/WSe2 nanostructures (Fig. 3 a) illustrate the peaks corresponded to W, Se, and C. The W peak at 283.0 eV is ascribed to the W 4d3/2 spin-orbital splitting photo-electrons in the WSe2 nanostructures (Fig. 3b). This peak is shifted to a lower binding energy region (282.4 eV) after the incorporation of RGO. The peak at 53.0 eV corresponded to Se 3d also shifts to lower binding energy (52.9 eV) after the incorporation of RGO (Fig. 3c). Whereas the C 1s peak at 283.1 eV upshifts to 283.2 eV after the incorporation of RGO (Fig. 3d). Besides, the binding energy of the W 4d3/2 peak is higher than that of W atom (Fig. 3b). This indicated that W cation in the nanostructures is positive four valences. The binding energy of the Se 3d peak is lower than that of its atom (Fig. 3c). This indicates that the Se is negative bivalents. The shift of binding energies of W4+ 4d3/2, Se 3d, and C 1s reveals an obvious charge transformation from RGO to WSe2. This is consistent with the photoluminescence analysis. The efficient charge transfer at the heterojunction interface has an important influence on the catalysis. Fig. 4 a illustrates the photoluminescence spectra that show the emission centered at ∼766 nm corresponded to a bandgap of ∼1.62 eV as excited at 445 nm. This bandgap is larger than the value reported for 1 T-WSe2, which could originate from the quantum refinement effect of synthesized 1 T-WSe2 nanosheets with nano-scale size. This emission enhanced when the RGO was incorporated. This implies the photogenerated electrons transfer from RGO to WSe2. This transfer characteristics agree to the XPS analysis results. Similar photoemission enhancement has also been reported for MoS2 [23,24] and WSe2 [25] by coupling plasmons. Besides, the reduction of 766 nm photoemission and appearance of 792 nm emission due to the Sn doping could originate from the charge transfer from the conduction band to Sn2+ impurity level. The enhanced photoconductivity (Fig. 4b) obtained from optical spectra (Supplied material 1) also revealed an efficient interface charge transfer. The spectra indicated that the charge transfer resulted from both RGO incorporation and Sn doping. This implies that the RGO incorporation and Sn doping are all beneficial to the photocatalytic and electrocatalytic activities for the WSe2. Surface wettability is also a factor affecting photocatalytic and electrocatalytic activities. High surface wettability is beneficial to reduce hydrogen bubbles formed on the catalyst surface, thereby increasing the density of electrochemically active sites [26,27]. Measured water contact angles are ∼43°, ∼38°, ∼35° and ∼33° for the WSe2, WSe2: Sn, WSe2/rGO, and WSe2: Sn/rGO, respectively (Fig. 4c). The RGO incorporation and Sn doping all enhanced the surface wettability for the WSe2. The samples coated on glass substrates were used for electrical resistance (ρ) measurement. The measured ρ values of WSe2 and WSe2: Sn are ∼4.80 and ∼4.22 × 102 Ω·cm that reduced to ∼0.25 and ∼0.14 ×102 Ω·cm after incorporating the RGO (Fig. 4c). The Sn doping increased the carrier concentration, thereby reducing the ρ. The RGO incorporation resulted in the efficient interface effect, and thereby also reduce the ρ. Similarly, it has been reported that the S vacancy in a MoS2 nanostructure increased the carrier concentration and so the conductivity [28]. The high hydrogen evolution electrocatalytic activity resulted from the low resistance has been reported in previous literature [6,28]. Fig. 4d indicated a stable photocatalytic H2 production activity in a period of 10 h for all the catalysts. The WSe2 and WSe2: Sn nanostructures showed the average H2 production yields of 55.4 mmol./g·h and 60.4 mmol./g·h. Whereas the RGO/WSe2 and RGO/WSe2: Sn hybrids showed the higher average H2 production yields of 71.1 mmol./g·h and 80.5 mmol./g·h and) The RGO and Sn doping all resulted in the dramatic enhancement of average H2 production yields. The 1 T-structure of WSe2 makes its yield ∼9233 times greater than its 2H structure (0.006 mmol./g·h) [29]. Similar results were also reported for MoS2 and MoSe2 [11]. The H2 evolution electrocatalytic activity of the assembled samples was evaluated by the electrical polarization. The measured curves indicate that the Pt/C electrode showed a small overpotential of −5.5 mV when the current density (J) reach 10 mA/cm2 and a near-zero onset potential of ∼6 mV (Fig. 5 a). At the same time the WSe2 and WSe2: Sn nanostructures showed the overpotential of −100.0 and −86.6 mV (Fig. 5b) and the onset near −38 and −35 mV, respectively. When the applied potential was −400 mV, the J reached ∼550 and −580 mA/cm2, respectively (Fig. 5a). After incorporating the RGO, the RGO.WSe2 and RGO/WSe2: Sn nanohybrids showed the lower onset of −11 and −8 mV and smaller overpotential of −95.3 and −94.4 mV as the J reaching 10 mA/cm2, respectively (Fig. 5b). When the applied potential reached −400 mV, the J increased to a higher value of −711 and −795 mA/cm2, respectively (Fig. 5a). The RGO incorporation and Sn doping all resulted in the dramatic enhancement of the H2 evolution catalytic activity. The H2 evolution catalytic activity also can be evaluated by the slopes of Tafel plots. Fig. 5c shows that the Tafel slopes of the WSe2 and WSe2: Sn nanostructures were 38 mV/decade and 36 mV/decade, respectively. Whereas, the RGO/WSe2 and RGO/WSe2: Sn nanohybrids showed the smaller Tafel slopes of 33 mV/decade and 32 mV/decade, respectively. The Tafel slope of the 32 − 38 mV/decade are smaller than that of the reported sheetlike 2H-WSe2 electrocatalyst (78 mV/decade) [14], RGO/2H-WSe2 (77.6 − 60 mV/decade) [30,31], and CNTs/2H-WSe2 (57.9 mV/decade) [32]. The Tafel slope of 32 mV/decade is near the reported value for the Pt/C electrode. The Tafel slope of 32 mV/decade and the overpotential of −94.4 mV confirm that the RGO/WSe2: Sn nanohybrid is a very excellent H2 evolution catalyst. Table 1 lists the H2 evolution electrocatalytic activities of the samples assembled in current work and reported previously. The RGO/WSe2 and RGO/WSe2: Sn nanohybrids showed higher activities than the RGO/1 T-MoS2 and RGO/1 T-MoS2: Cu nanohybrids assembled with a chemical solution reaction [33]. The WSe2 and RGO/WSe2 also showed higher activities than the 1 T-MoS2 and RGO/1 T-MoS2 assembled with a hydrothermal process [34]. This could be ascribed to the higher reduction potential of WSe2 resulted from the higher conduction band level. All the samples assembled in current work also showed the H2 evolution catalytic activities very superior than the reported 2H-WSe2 [14], RGO/WSe2 [30,31], CNTs/2H-WSe2 [32], 2 H/T-MoSe2 [35], MoSe2 [36], RGO/1 T-MoS2 [39], and RGO/MoS2: O [28]. The catalytic stability of the assembled catalysts was evaluated by 5000 cycles. The WSe2 and WSe2: Sn nanostructures showed the decay of <6.0 and 5.0 %, whereas the WSe2/rGO and WSe2: Sn/rGO nanohybrids showed more smaller decay of <2.5 and 2.0 %, respectively (Fig. 5d). The RGO/WSe2 and RGO/WSe2: Sn nanohybrids showed a smaller loss than the WSe2 and WSe2: Sn nanostructures. This could originate from slow 1 T→2H conversion that resulted from the low resistance that leads to low heat formation [6]. The Sn doping also resulted in a low resistance, thereby increasing stability. To a great extent, the charge transfer at the heterojunction interface has a large dependence on the band level alignment. Using the methods reported previously [38,39], the absolute work function (χ) of 5.34 eV was obtained for intrinsic WSe2. The χ of 4.25 eV has been reported for single-layer RGO [40]. Therefore, the conduction level (E c) of 6.15 eV and valence level (E v) of 4.53 eV of WSe2 were calculated based on the relations of E c=χ+E g/2 and E v=χ-E g/2. In which, the E g of the WSe2 nanostructure was estimated to be ∼1..62 eV from the photoluminescence spectra. TheWSe2 possesses lower E c than the RGO, resulting in the efficient electron transfers from RGO to WSe2. This is consistent with the photoluminescence and XPS spectra analyses. This highly efficient charge transfer resulted in the lower resistance and higher and photoconductivity, thereby enhancing the H2 evolution catalytic activity."
3,Conclusion,"RGO/1 T-WSe2: Sn/ nanostructures were synthesized by a one-step modified hydrothermal process. The synthesized WSe2, WSe2: Sn nanostructures, and them in their hybrids with RGO possessed 1 T structure and nanosheet morphology. This facile process resulted in the formation of 1 T-WSe2 nanosheets. Simultaneously, the efficient charge transfer at the heterojunction interface and Sn doping all increased the conductivity and photoconductivity. Thus, the 1 T-WSe2, 1 T-WSe2: Sn and their nanohybrids with RGO assembled in current work all showed the dramatically enhanced H2 evolution catalytic activity and stability compared to the previously reported 2H-WSe2. The RGO/1 T-WSe2: Sn nanohybrids showed the most excellent H2 evolution catalytic performances (onset of −8 mV, overpotential of − 94.4 mV at J = 10 mA/cm2, J = −795 mA/cm2 at the applied potential of 400 mV, and Tafel slope of 32 mV/decade)."
