0,Introduction,"Due to rapid globalization and industrialization, energy consumption has increased exponentially. Presently, most of the usable energy comes from non-renewal fossil-based fuels, which leads to the energy crisis and climate change. The utilization of H2 gas as an energy is a promising alternative, fundamentally because of its non-polluting nature [1], sustainability [2], and high energy density (142 kJ/g) [3]. Biological process of H2 production is more environmentally friendly and less energy-intensive than other conventional processes [4]. Among all the biological process, dark fermentation (DF) is considered as most promising because it requires less energy, uses diverse feedstocks (including organic waste materials), and operates at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure [2,4,5]. Furthermore, spent wash of DF can be utilized in several second stage processes such as algal cultivation, biomethanation, microbial fuel cell and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) production etc. [6–10]. The H2 production occurs during DF by a diverse group of anaerobic bacteria belongs to Bacillus sp., Clostridium sp., Klebsiella sp., and Enterobacter sp. [1,11–14]. Pure or mixed culture can be employed for H2 production. Higher H2 yield (HY) can be achieved by using pure strains. However, mixed consortia are preferred for their wide choice of feedstocks, ease of control and economical operation [1]. Additionally, H2 production using anaerobic organic waste can be carried out without sterilization [15]. Hence, studies on H2 production using mixed consortia has attracted research attention. Most of the study on dark fermentative H2 production has been conducted using simple sugars such as xylose, fructose, glucose, sucrose and arabinose [13,16,17]. These pure substrates contribute to high process costs. On the other hand, organic waste has considerable COD, which is harmful to the environment. This can be used as a feedstock for dark fermentation [18]. Hence, the utilization of wastes for hydrogen production has dual benefits of bioremediation and energy generation. Previously, different organic wastes such as molasses wastewater [19], rice winery wastewater [20], domestic wastewater [21], distillery effluent [22], food waste [23], paper mill wastewater [24], etc. were used for H2 production. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB, 2009–2010) has listed the distillery industry as of the 17th highly polluted industry in India. In general, distilleries discard around 8–15 L of effluent per L of produced alcohol, which significantly pollutes the groundwater. On the other hand, starchy wastewater discharged effluent of rice cooking kitchens is a potent source of water pollution due to reasonably higher COD [25]. Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur generates approximately 2000 L of starchy wastewater daily from student hostels (total no of student hall: 21). According to United States Department of Agriculture (USDA, 2013–2014), India is the second-largest producer of groundnut oilseed with about 15% share in the world. Groundnut de-oiled cake, the primary residue of oil-producing industry, can be used as a potent nutrient supplement for microbial growth [8]. Environmental conditions and media composition including pH, substrate concentration, macronutrients, micronutrients, microorganisms (inoculum size, inoculum age), temperature and agitation speed showed great influence on H2 production in DF [26,27]. Hydrogenase enzyme activity, which is mainly responsible for the production of hydrogen, depends on the pH value [28]. An increase in substrate concentration could promote H2 production. On the contrary, cell growth can be inhibited by an excessive substrate concentration because of high osmotic pressure [26]. Similarly, nitrogen (macronutrient) and metal ions (micronutrient) have a significant role in H2 production [8]. An increase in inoculum size could increase the H2 production. At high inoculum size, more carbon is devoted to biomass formation rather than H2 production [29]. Likewise, the optimal inoculum age indicates the presence of the most active log phase [29]. Similarly, temperature has a pivotal role in H2 production. It influences the growth of microorganism, metabolic pathway and rate of substrate consumption [30]. Agitation speed is one of the important process parameters which significantly influence the H2 production in the DF [31]. An optimum agitation ensures that a uniform suspension of microbial cells in a homogenous nutrient medium [31]. Many reports have shown the effects of these parameters on H2 production based on the “one-variable-at-a-time” approach (single parameter optimization) [26,32]. Nevertheless, interactive effects among the selected independent variable cannot be explained clearly and would be inaccurate for the evaluation of optimal points [30,33]. Whereas, statistical methods, i.e., response surface methodology (RSM) coupled with central composite design (CCD) are accurate with minimal experimental runs, and approach exact optima [34]. Furthermore, these methods are capable of illustrating the interactive effects among the tested variables. RSM has been successfully applied in the past for enhancement of bioH2 production [35]. However, a major limitation of RSM is that it is incapable of modeling highly non-linear response accurately [36]. Subsequently, an inaccurate optimum level of independent variables is evaluated. On the contrary, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can successfully address and overcome this limitation of RSM [37]. In recent years, application of AI based modeling methods such as artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) have received increased attention. Karthic et al., (2013) showed that ANN possesses better prediction accuracy as compared to the RSM model in the investigation of dark fermentative H2 production [33]. There is no such report is available on the application of SVM for the maximization of dark fermentative H2 production. Wang and Wan, 2009 revealed that genetic algorithm (GA) coupled with ANN has better optimization capability than RSM for the maximization of fermentative H2 production [38]. Similarly, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is another optimization technique available in AI. The present study investigates the step by step enhancement of dark fermentative H2 production from organic wastes using several optimization approaches. This is the first attempt to implement the SVM model in biological process optimization and to compare it with ANN and RSM along with validation study."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Collection and enrichment of H2 producing seed sludge,"2.1 Collection and enrichment of H2 producing seed sludge The inoculum used for bioH2 production was collected from a waste treatment plant located inside Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur campus. In order to inhibit the H2 consuming bacteria, heat treatment was done at around 100 °C for 10 min [26]. The pH, volatile suspended solid (VSS), total suspended solid (TSS), total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) and soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) were 6.94 ± 0.2, 22,500 ± 112 mg L−1, 31,400 ± 210 mg L−1, 31,800 ± 131 mg L−1 and 900 ± 96 mg L−1, respectively. The media used for the enrichment of pre-treated seed sludge comprises of glucose (10 g L−1), yeast extract (3 g L−1) and FeSO4·7H2O (100 mg L−1) [39]. The pH of the media was set to 6.5 by using 5 N NaOH or 5 N HCl. 10% (v/v) pre-treated inoculum was transferred to the media using a syringe in an aseptic condition. The inoculated bottle was incubated in an incubator shaker (New Brunswick Scientific, NJ, USA) at 37 °C and 180 rpm [33]. The acidogenic mixed consortia was developed by repetitive sub-culturing the enriched culture [39]."
3,Selection of different organic waste and residue for replacement of pure media,"2.2 Selection of different organic waste and residue for replacement of pure media For the reduction of overall process cost, glucose and yeast extract (YE) were replaced by organic wastes. Rice grain based distillery effluent (DE) and residential starchy wastewater (SW) were selected based on their availability as an alternative of glucose. SW and DE were collected from IFB Agro Industries, West Bengal, India, and student hostels, IIT Kharagpur, India, respectively. The physicochemical characterization was done using the standard protocols (Table 1 ). Suitability of DE and SW as a substrate for dark fermentative H2 production was studied by using different initial concentrations. Furthermore, groundnut de-oiled cake (GDOC), collected from a local grocery shop in Kharagpur campus was used as a substitute of yeast extract. Suitability of GDOC as a co-substrate for H2 production was studied and compared with yeast extract."
4,Experimental setup,"2.3 Experimental setup All the optimization studies and waste selection experiments were conducted in 70 mL anaerobic media in 100 mL serum bottles. Before inoculation of the enriched culture into the media, the serum bottles containing media were sparged with N2 for 5 min to create the anaerobic conditions, sealed tightly by crimping and autoclaved at 15 psi for 15 min. The inoculated bottles were incubated in an incubator shaker for 36 h. Cumulative gas produced in the serum bottle was collected after 36 h incubation by water displacement method [40] and analyzed by gas chromatography. All the experiments were carried out in triplicates."
5,Optimization of physicochemical parameters for enhanced H2 production,"2.4 Optimization of physicochemical parameters for enhanced H2 production 2.4.1 Single parameters optimization Single parameter optimization with respect to initial pH (5.5–7.5), initial concentration of GDOC (5–25 g L−1), inoculum size or ratio (6–12% v/v), inoculum age (8–13 h), reaction temperature (35–41 °C) and agitation speed (80–230 rpm), were done to find out the low level (−1) and high level (+1) of the parameters for further optimization study. Every parameter was optimized by keeping other parameters constant. 2.4.2 Taguchi orthogonal design The Taguchi method was first developed by Genichi Taguchi for the improvement of product quality. This has been employed to determine the effect of physicochemical parameters on the HY [26]. The degree of influence of each parameter was evaluated using the Taguchi orthogonal (L27) design of experiment. In this study, six factors viz. initial pH, GDOC concentration, inoculum volume, inoculum age, reaction temperature and agitation speed were studied with three levels of factors (Table S1). The orthogonal array with 27 experimental combinations was depicted (Table 2 ). Thereafter, the obtained experimental results were further analyzed through signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) by evaluating the effect of the factors to the response using the statistical software package MINITAB v15.10, Minitab Inc., USA. The larger-the-better S/N ratio indicates better performance for the output [41]. Therefore, the algorithm for larger-the-better S/N ratio was chosen as the optimum condition [42]. 2.4.3 Multi-parameter optimization 2.4.3.1 Response surface methodology The optimum level of physicochemical parameters and the cumulative effect of their mutual interaction were investigated by response surface methodology (RSM). RSM is a statistical approach which explores the relationship between several independent variables and one or more dependent variables. The most influential parameters resulting from the Taguchi analysis have been selected as independent variables for RSM analysis. The variables so chosen were initial pH ( X 1 ), GDOC ( X 2 ) and temperature ( X 3 ). The corresponding response variable measured was HY (Y). A five-level three-factor central composite design (CCD) was used to perform the RSM. The experimental design levels for CCD were summarized in Table 3 . The design comprised of 20 experiments with six numbers of zero level points generated by the software MINITAB 15 (Table 4 ). The response behaviour was explained using a second order quartic equation with three variables as illustrated in Eq. (1). (1) Y = C 0 + ∑ i = 1 n C i X i + ∑ i = 1 n C ii X i 2 + ∑ i = 1 ; j = 1 ; i ≠ j n C ij X i X j where Y is the predictive response, n is no. of variables, C0 is the constant, Ci is the linear coefficient, Cii is the quadratic coefficient, Cij is the interaction coefficient, and X is the uncoded level of input variable. The multivariate equation, Eq. (1), can be simultaneously solved by analysing the RSM model to obtain the optimum level of independent variables. The significance of the regression model was evaluated using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The MINITAB generated two-dimensional contour plots to obtain a graphical understanding of the interactive effects on the individual responses of the input variables. 2.4.3.2 Artificial intelligence Artificial intelligence (AI) is field of computer science that highlights the development of intelligent machines that works and behaves like humans. The most common real world applications of AI are speech recognition, classification and nonlinear regression. The bioH2 production is an extremely complex process. So, the relation between dependent variables and independent variables are highly non-linear in nature. Many researchers reported that the AI is more appropriate than statistical approaches for bioH2 production [33,43]. AI based modeling tools formulate the relationship among variables and provide the appropriate fitness function that can be optimized by optimization tools to get the optimized condition. 2.4.3.2.1 Modeling tools in AI There are several numbers of modeling tools available in AI. Among them, artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM) have received great attention for modeling non-linear systems. 2.4.3.2.1.1 Artificial neural network A neural network is a mathematical description of a brain’s neurological activity [33]. It replicates the brain’s learning process by mathematically modeling the network architecture of interlinked neurons. A typical neural network comprises of input, hidden, and output layer [33]. The neurons in the hidden layer which are connected to the input neurons and output layers by adjustable weights allow the network to calculate complex associations between the input and output variables [33]. The non-linear transformation of input signal of a node in the neural network to an output signal is processed by an activation function. This can be performed after adding weighted inputs to the neuron, and including bias as described in Eq. (2) [44]. The most preferable activation function is the hyperbolic tangent function (Eq. (3)) [45]. In the present study, the experimental data were obtained by performing CCD. Table 4 was employed to establish an ANN model by dividing the data into three sets (70% for training, 15% for testing and 15% for validating) [46]. A multilayer perceptron feed-forward neural network with error back propagation (BP) with Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm is implemented to train the proposed ANN [46] using MATLAB version 17A (Mathworks Inc., Natick, USA). (2) y j = ∑ i = 1 n x i w ij + θ j (3) f y j = 2 1 + e x p ( - 2 y j ) - 1 where xi is the input parameters matrix, wij is the connection weights matrix, bj indicates the bias matrix and yi is the weighted inputs. The number of neurons in hidden layers was adjusted to obtain optimal neural network. The goodness of fit for each structure was analyzed by mean squared error (MSE) and overall correlation coefficient (R). 2.4.3.2.1.2 Support vector machines The basic idea of the SVM regression is to trap the input data into a high dimensional feature space via nonlinear mapping [47]. In the feature space, a linear decision function is constructed (Eq. (4)) [47]. The optimum decision function is established by employing structural risk minimization (SRM) principle from computational learning theory (Eq. (5)) [48]. Subsequently, the inner product of feature space is mapped into the original space via kernel function. Different kernel function can be adopted to construct different type of SVM. The selected kernel must be satisfying the Mercer’s condition [47]. (4) f x , ω = ∑ j = 1 m ω j Φ j x + b where, x is the low dimensional input from the data set of ( x i , y i ) ∈ R n × R ; j ( = 1 , ⋯ , m > n ) indicates number of feature space dimension; Φ j x is a set of nonlinear transformation; ω j is a vector of weights in feature space, and b stands for ‘bias’. (5) min J ω , ζ = 1 2 ω T ω + C ∑ i = 1 n ( ζ i + ζ i ∗ ) Subject to: (6a) y i - f x i , ω ≤ ∊ + ζ i ∗ (6b) f x i , ω - y i ≤ ∊ + ζ i (6c) ζ i , ζ i ∗ ≥ 0 , i = 0 , ⋯ , n where ζ i and ζ i ∗ are slack variables, ∊ is the accuracy demanded for the approximation and C represents box constraint [47]. The most commonly used kernel is the radial basis function (RBF), because it provides less error than other kernel function. Furthermore, RBF has fewer parameters to be set than linear, polynomial and sigmoid kernel function [47]. Therefore, this study applied RBF for developing the SVM model in MATLAB version 17A using the experimental data listed in the Table 4. The quality of SVM model is strongly depended on the proper setting of SVM parameters [47]. Three major parameters viz. box constraint ( C ), epsilon ( ∊ ) and kernel scale ( γ ) must be set appropriately to achieve its best possible performance. 2.4.3.2.2 Optimization tools in AI Once the ANN and SVM models are formulated, these are considered as an objective function for further optimization by several optimization algorithms (tools) available in AI. The tools explored in this study are genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). 2.4.3.2.2.1 Genetic algorithm GA, an AI based stochastic non-linear optimization technique inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the class of evolutionary algorithms (EA). This is commonly applied to generate a high quality solution. Solutions from one population are used to create a new population that must be better than the old one [49]. The algorithm employs three main types of bio-inspired rules at each step to create the next generation from the current population. These are mutation, crossover and selection [50]. The iteration continues until an optimal solution is achieved. 2.4.3.2.2.2 Particle swarm optimization PSO, a population based stochastic optimization technique developed by Eberhart and Kennedy, 1995 is inspired by social behaviour of fish schooling or bird flocking [51]. In PSO, several particles are randomly generated to form a population. In contrast to GA, PSO particles are not discarded. The particles move in the multidimensional space to find the optimal solution. A particle is a possible solution to the optimization problem. Each particle passes in the multidimensional space. The motion of the particles is governed by its velocity. In every iteration, each particle carries two best values. These are ‘pbest’ as the particle best known position and ‘gbest’ as the swarm group best position [45]. The velocities and positions of a particle are updated according to the equation Eq. (7) and Eq. (8), respectively. (7) V id ( t + 1 ) = W V id ( t ) + C 1 r 1 p id - X id t + C 2 r 2 p gd - X id t (8) X id ( t + 1 ) = X id ( t ) + V id ( t + 1 ) where, V id is particle velocity, W is inertia weight, C 1 and C 2 are constant, p id is individual best position, p gd is global best position, r 1 and r 2 are random numbers lying in the range of (0.0, 1.0), and X id ( t ) is current particle position."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods Gas Chromatography (GC Agilent Technology 7890A U.S.A) fitted with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a Porapak Q stainless steel (80/100) has been used to determine the concentration of H2 in the gas phase [39]. The operational conditions are mentioned in literature [39]. As previously reported, the flame ionization detector (FID) was used to estimate volatile fatty acids and ethanol [39]. The COD was estimated using a COD measuring instrument (DRB200 & DR2800 Portable Spectrophotometer HACH®, USA) based on the APHA standard protocols. Total carbohydrate content was measured using the phenol–sulphuric acid method as described by Dubois et al., 1956 [52]. Estimation of VSS, TS, TSS, TDS, TVS etc. were done using APHA standard methods."
7,Result and discussion,
8,Preliminary experiments with glucose media using enriched mixed consortia,"3.1 Preliminary experiments with glucose media using enriched mixed consortia Batch experiments were performed to study the suitability of the heat shock pretreated mixed consortia for H2 production. The maximum HY of 2.30 ± 0.05 mol H2 mol−1 glucoseconsumed was achieved using the mixed consortia. The maximum glucose conversion efficiency, final pH and cell mass concentration after fermentation were 85 ± 2%, 4.2 ± 0.21 and 1.85 ± 0.15 g L−1, respectively. Gas analysis showed the presence of H2 and carbon dioxide. H2 purity of 55 ± 4% was achieved using the heat pre-treated mixed consortia. It was also observed that no methane gas was produced during the fermentation. The major soluble metabolic products (SMP) formed during the fermentation were acetate (1600 ± 50 mg L−1) and butyrate (2700 ± 60 mg L−1) with very low amount of ethanol (200 ± 25 mg L−1). High concentration of butyrate in the fermentation broth indicates that the butyrate fermentation was dominated during H2 production [53]. Kumari and Das, 2017 observed similar result using the heat shock pre-treated mixed consortia [8]. Usually acetate and butyrate production pathways favour the H2 production whereas ethanol production indicates the consumption of H2 during the fermentation [26]. Therefore, it can be concluded that the heat shock pretreatment is an efficient method for the development of acidogenic mixed consortia."
9,Hydrogen production from organic wastes supplemented with yeast extract using enriched mixed consortia,"3.2 Hydrogen production from organic wastes supplemented with yeast extract using enriched mixed consortia H2 production potential of the selected wastewater was studied at different initial concentration (%v/v) with initial pH of 6.5. Maximum HY of 8.53 ± 0.25 and 3.99 ± 0.30 mol H2 kg−1 CODremoved were observed using SW and DE, respectively (Fig. 1 ). Highest cumulative H2 production of 1550 ± 80 mL L−1 was achieved using 100 %v/v SW. The plausible reason for the lower H2 production could be presence of higher suspended particles in DE."
10,Hydrogen production from SW supplemented with GDOC using enriched mixed consortia,"3.3 Hydrogen production from SW supplemented with GDOC using enriched mixed consortia Characterization of GDOC shown in Table 5 revealed the presence of nitrogen containing nutrients (e.g. proteins, ammonium, nitrate and nitrite). These nutrients have significant impact on H2 production because nitrogen source is required for cell replication, maintenance and cellular metabolism. Furthermore, atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) quantifies the presence of metal ions such as ferrous, magnesium, zinc, nickel, and manganese in GDOC. Metal ions act as cofactors for different enzymes which are involved in the metabolic pathway of H2 producing bacteria. The magnesium content was found higher followed by ferrous ion. CHNS analysis showed 7 %w/w nitrogen content in the GDOC. In order to study the suitability of the GDOC as a supplement with SW, preliminary studies were carried out using equivalent amount of nitrogen content of yeast extract. The study revealed the suitability of GDOC as a co-substrate with SW for H2 production. However, lower HY of 3.8 ± 0.30 mol H2 kg−1 CODremoved was observed using GDOC as a supplement as compared to yeast extract (Fig. 2 ). Mishra et al., (2014) obtained maximum HY of 7.4 mol H2 kg−1 CODremoved using GDOC as a co-substrate with DE [54]. Therefore, further optimization study was conducted for the improvement of HY."
11,Optimization of physicochemical parameters for further improvement in hydrogen production,"3.4 Optimization of physicochemical parameters for further improvement in hydrogen production 3.4.1 Single parameter optimization Effect of different process parameters viz. pH, GDOC concentration, ferrous sulphate concentration, temperature, inoculum size, inoculum age and agitation speed on H2 production was studied. Fig. 3 summarized all the single parameter optimization study. Initially, suitable GDOC concentration was determined by varying the concentration from 5 g L−1 to 25 g L−1. The maximum HY of 7.37 mol H2 kg−1 CODremoved was observed at GDOC concentration of 15 g L−1. Further increase in GDOC concentration showed inhibitory effect on H2 production. The probable reason could be the presence of higher amount of solid particulate materials that leads to insufficient mixing [31]. Effect of initial pH was investigated in the range of 5.5 to 7.5 by holding other variables constant. HY was increased with increasing initial pH from 5.5 to 6.5. Further increase in pH leads to pH inhibition on hydrogenage enzyme, which is mainly responsible for H2 production [28,55]. Inoculum size is an important factor of any biological process. Therefore, the inoculum size was investigated by varying the inoculum 6 to 12 %v/v. The maximum HY (7.39 mol H2 kg−1 CODremoved) was found at 10 %v/v inoculum size. Further, increase in the size of inoculum leads to decrement in HY. At high inoculum volume, more carbon was devoted to biomass formation instead of H2 production [29]. Similarly, the effect of inoculum age was studied by varying the culture age from 8 h to 13 h by keeping other parameters constant. Inoculum age of 11 h was observed most suitable for maximum H2 yield of 8.11 mol H2 kg−1 CODremoved. This might be due to presence of the most active cells in the exponential growth phase of the culture [29]. The effect of temperature was investigated in the range of 35–41 °C by maintaining other parameters constant. Increased production of H2 was observed by rising the temperature. The maximum HY was found at 37 °C temperature. The lower HY was observed at higher temperature may be attributed to thermal deactivation of hydrogenage enzyme [29]. Similarly, the effect of different agitation speed was also studied. The highest HY was 8.12 mol H2 kg−1 CODremoved at 180 rpm. Further increase in agitation speed leads to decrease in HY possibly due to damage in cell structure because of intolerable shear stress. 3.4.2 Taguchi design of experiments Taguchi L27 orthogonal experimental design was performed to assess the rank of influence of process parameters on the HY [39]. The levels of each factor were determined by single parameter optimization. A significant difference in HY was noticed in the designed sets of experiment, suggesting that the H2 production was significantly dependent on the chosen process parameters. Highest HY of 8.12 mol H2 kg−1 CODremoved was achieved at GDOC concentration 20 g L−1, pH 6.5, temperature 39 °C, inoculum age 10 h, inoculum size 8% v/v, and agitation speed 180 rpm. The main effects plot for S/N ratio clearly indicates the degree of influence of the selected parameters (Fig. 4 ). pH was found to be the most influential factor, followed by GDOC concentration and temperature (Table S2). It can be said that dark fermentative H2 production is highly sensitive to pH change in medium. Similarly, L9 orthogonal Taguchi design was used by Ma et al., 2011 to find out the rank of influential factors for H2 production from cornstalk waste [56]. Their study showed that substrate concentration and pH were most influential parameter for dark fermentative H2 production. Therefore, the performance of H2 production at optimized pH, GDOC concentration and temperature would improve the process efficiency. 3.4.3 Multi-parameter optimization Once the Taguchi analysis was done, three most influential parameters (pH, GDOC concentration and temperature) were selected for further optimization. 3.4.3.1 Response surface methodology The optimum level of the prescribed parameters and the effects of their mutual interactions on HY were explored by central composite design of RSM. By employing multi-regression analysis on the experimental data (Table 4), the following second order polynomial equation (Eq. (9)) was established to explain the H2 production: (9) Y = 10.21 X 1 + 0.35 X 2 + 1.2 X 3 - 0.03 X 1 X 2 + 0.084 X 1 X 3 - 0.96 X 1 2 - 0.062 X 2 2 - 0.023 X 3 2 - 51.06 where, X1, X2 and X3 are the actual values of pH, GDOC concentration (g L−1) and temperature (°C), respectively. Y is the corresponding predicted HY (mol H2/kg CODremoved). The significance of the coefficients of the RSM model were considered significant based on their p value (p < 0.05) (Table S3). Multiple regression analysis estimated an R2 value of 0.94 indicating the model can explain 94% variability of the response. As per the statistical standards, R2 value should be 0.95 or higher for an accurate curve fit [57]. However, the quality of the regression was further evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Table S4). Adequacy of the regression model was confirmed by the significant F-value (>4.772) and p value (<0.05) [58]. Two dimensional contour plots to estimate the mutual interaction among the input variables are illustrated in Fig. 5 . These figures were constructed by varying two independent variables when the third variable was kept constant in their zero level. The elliptical shape of the contour plot suggests the significant interaction between two independent variables and the maximum predicted value is specified by the surface confined in the smallest ellipse in the contour diagram [35,59,60]. The contour plot obtained for interaction between pH and GDOC (fixed temperature) and between pH and temperature (fixed GDOC) showed the maximum HY at the point of intersection of major and minor axes of the ellipse, suggesting high correlation levels [13,61]. On the other hand, an insignificant interaction between GDOC and temperature was observed in the third contour plot. Consequently, an insignificant p-value was observed for the interaction between GDOC and temperature in the regression equation (Eq. (9)). However, the highest response region for all the contour plots had located in plots itself, which means the maximum H2 production could be achieved inside the designed boundary [61]. Eventually, the optimum condition for obtaining maximum HY was calculated by setting the partial derivative of Eq. (9) to zero. The optimum process parameters evaluated by RSM were pH 6.65, GDOC concentration 16.10 g L−1 and temperature 37.71 °C and the corresponding predicted HY was 8.15 mol H2 kg−1 CODremoved (Fig. S1). 3.4.3.2 Artificial intelligence Using the experimental results listed in Table 4, ANN and SVM model was constructed to model the relationship between HY and the process parameters. The training of the ANN adopting 3-10-1 network topology (Fig. 6 ) was done for 6 epochs after which MSE and R values were found to be 0.0028 and 0.985, respectively. Lower MSE and higher R value suggested that there was a well captured relationship between target and predicted values. Similarly, SVM was constructed with the RBF kernel function to predict bioH2 production because it can reduce computational complexity during data training. A two steps grid search method with a seven fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the SVM model parameters. The optimum values for the model parameter was obtained by heuristic method. Box constraint ( C ), epsilon ( ∊ ) and kernel scale ( γ ) were 6, 0.002 and 3.6, respectively. Using the above values of the SVM parameters, MSE and R values were evaluated as 0.0019 and 0.989, respectively. Training time was observed to be less than ten seconds for obtaining the SVM model. Once the ANN and SVM models were generated to the desired level of accuracy, these were subsequently used as fitness function in GA and PSO optimization algorithms to evaluate the optimal condition for enhanced H2 production. The parameters used in GA and PSO algorithms are selected based on literature [46,62,63]. Optimal values of the process parameters and the corresponding H2 yields are shown in Fig. 7 . It is seen that there is no difference in arriving the optimal solution and the corresponding HY evaluated by GA and PSO using same fitness function. However, PSO was observed to be faster than GA for finding optimal solution. As shown in the plot (Fig. 7), the global optimal solution was obtained after 30 iterations by GA, whereas PSO executed the solution in 10 iterations. The plausible reason for the above cause is that PSO does not comprise of highly complex genetic operators such as crossover and mutation like GA."
12,Comparison of prediction capability of RSM with ANN and SVM,"3.5 Comparison of prediction capability of RSM with ANN and SVM Prediction capability of developed RSM model was compared with ANN and SVM on the basis of several parameters such as R2 and RMSE. The experimental and predicted data are summarized in Table 4. R2 and RMSE values listed in Table 4 indicate that both ANN and SVM have better prediction accuracy than RSM. This higher prediction accuracy from AI based model can be assigned to their ability of analysis higher order non-linear systems whereas RSM has been using second order polynomial. Several studies have also shown that ANN and SVM approach are superior to RSM [62,64]. Additionally, SVM was found to be better than ANN in terms of prediction capability with its high R2 and low RMSE on the data tested. The probable reason could be due to the higher generalization capability of SVM as compared to ANN [65]. ANN suffers from several weakness such as large set of data requirement, over fitting, slow convergence velocity [51]. Similar result was also obtained by Asfaram et al., 2016 where these models are used for modeling of adsorption of methylene blue dye [49]. This is the first report to use SVM model for the analysis of dark fermentative H2 production."
13,Validation studies,"3.6 Validation studies The validation studies were conducted to confirm the model prediction under all the optimized conditions evaluated by RSM, ANN-GA, ANN-PSO, SVM-GA and SVM-PSO. The maximum HY of 8.28 mol H2 kg−1 CODremoved was achieved under the optimized condition of pH 6.75, GDOC concentration 16.16 g L−1 and temperature 37.55 °C determined by SVM-GA and SVM-PSO models (Fig. 8 ). The result is comparable with other reported data (Table 6 ). The cumulative H2 production using SVM based models were 7.56% and 16.22% higher than RSM and ANN based models, respectively. Moreover, the results showed only a small difference between the predicted and experimental values which indicates the high efficiency of GA and PSO. Foroughi et al., 2019 presented SVM as more accurate as compared to RSM [64]. Similarly, Akande et al., 2014 compared SVM and ANN in terms of robustness, stability and performance. Their study recommended SVM for better prediction [65]. Further study is in progress to analyse the system in detail under optimal condition considering carbohydrate, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) etc."
14,Conclusion,"The perspective of the present study was to improve the dark fermentative H2 production from organic wastes using heat shock pretreated mixed consortia followed by determination of suitable model for the optimization of the process. SW supplemented with GDOC was found to be the most suitable combination for H2 production. Taguchi analysis showed pH as the most influential parameter followed by GDOC concentration and temperature. Further, these parameters were selected for multi-parameter optimization using RSM and AI based tools. SVM model performed better than RSM and ANN models in terms of prediction capability. Additionally, the maximum HY was achieved by the SVM model coupled with GA and PSO. Consequently, the HY was improved more than two folds after the optimization study as compare to unoptimized condition. The present research work is an attempt to find out the suitable optimization technique for the maximization of dark fermentative H2 production from organic wastes."
